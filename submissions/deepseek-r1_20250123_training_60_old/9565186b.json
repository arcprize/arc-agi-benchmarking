        "cot_1": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. So, there are these input grids and output grids. Let me look at the examples one by one to see what's changing.\n\nStarting with Example 0:\n\nInput:\n[2, 2, 2]\n[2, 1, 8]\n[2, 8, 8]\n\nOutput:\n[2, 2, 2]\n[2, 5, 5]\n[2, 5, 5]\n\nHmm. The first row stays the same. The second row changes the 1 and 8 to 5s. The third row also changes both 8s to 5s. Wait, but the middle element in the second row was 1, and that also became 5. So maybe 1 and 8 are being converted to 5s in certain positions?\n\nLooking at Example 1:\n\nInput:\n[1, 1, 1]\n[8, 1, 3]\n[8, 2, 2]\n\nOutput:\n[1, 1, 1]\n[5, 1, 5]\n[5, 5, 5]\n\nHere, the first row stays. In the second row, the 8 and 3 become 5s, but the 1 remains. The third row turns 8, 2, 2 into all 5s. Wait, the 2s here became 5? But in Example 0, some 8s turned into 5. Maybe the rule isn't just replacing 1 and 8. Let me think again.\n\nIn Example 2:\n\nInput:\n[2, 2, 2]\n[8, 8, 2]\n[2, 2, 2]\n\nOutput:\n[2, 2, 2]\n[5, 5, 2]\n[2, 2, 2]\n\nSo the middle row's 8s become 5s, but the 2 stays. The other rows remain. So maybe 8s are being turned into 5s only if they are adjacent to certain numbers? Or perhaps it's about the position in the grid?\n\nWait, maybe the first row is always kept the same. Let's check that. In all examples, the first row of the output is the same as the input. Example 0, 1, 2, 3 all have the first row unchanged. So that's a possible rule.\n\nThen, the other rows might be transformed. Let's see.\n\nIn Example 0, the second row input is [2,1,8], output [2,5,5]. The third row input [2,8,8] becomes [2,5,5]. So the 2 in the first position remains, others turned to 5.\n\nIn Example 1, second row [8,1,3] becomes [5,1,5]. Third row [8,2,2] becomes [5,5,5]. So here, the first element was 8, turned to 5. The middle in second row was 1, which stayed. The third element 3 became 5. Hmm.\n\nIn Example 2, second row [8,8,2] becomes [5,5,2]. So first two 8s become 5s, 2 remains. Third row is same as input.\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput:\n[3,3,8]\n[4,4,4]\n[8,1,1]\n\nOutput:\n[5,5,5]\n[4,4,4]\n[5,5,5]\n\nWait, the first row was [3,3,8] and became all 5s. But earlier examples had the first row unchanged. Oh wait, in example 3, the first row is modified. So my initial thought that the first row is kept the same is incorrect. So that's a problem. So maybe the first row isn't always kept. Let's re-examine that.\n\nWait, example 3's input first row is [3,3,8], output is [5,5,5]. So that's different. So that breaks the initial hypothesis. Hmm.\n\nSo maybe the rule is more about the entire grid. Let's look for another pattern.\n\nAnother approach: Maybe in each row except the first, certain numbers are being replaced with 5. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's about the perimeter of the grid. Wait, the outputs in example 0, the second and third rows have 5s on the right. Maybe the edges are being converted to 5? But in example 0, the middle element in the second row is 5. Let me check.\n\nWait, example 0's input second row is [2,1,8], output [2,5,5]. So the first element remains, others become 5. Third row input [2,8,8] becomes [2,5,5]. Again, first element same, others 5.\n\nExample 1's second row input [8,1,3], output [5,1,5]. So first and third elements become 5, middle remains. Third row [8,2,2] becomes all 5s. So first element was 8\u21925, others 2\u21925. Wait, but 2 is not 8 or 1. So why did they change?\n\nIn Example 2's second row [8,8,2] becomes [5,5,2]. So first two elements (8s) become 5, third (2) remains. Third row is same as input. So the third row here is the same as the first row. Maybe the rows that are same as the first row are kept, others modified?\n\nBut in example 3, the first row was [3,3,8], output [5,5,5], which is different. So that's not the case.\n\nAlternative idea: Maybe the rows that are not identical to the first row have their elements replaced with 5, except for elements that are the same as the first row's corresponding element. Let's test this.\n\nTake example 0:\n\nFirst row is [2,2,2]. Second row is [2,1,8]. The first element is same as first row's first element (2), so stays. The other elements are different (1 and 8 vs 2), so they become 5. Third row [2,8,8] \u2192 first element 2 same, others become 5. So output rows 2 and 3 become [2,5,5] each. Which matches the output.\n\nExample 1:\n\nFirst row [1,1,1]. Second row [8,1,3]. First element 8 vs 1 \u2192 becomes 5. Second element 1 same \u2192 stays. Third element 3 vs 1 \u2192 becomes 5. So output [5,1,5]. Third row [8,2,2]. All elements are different from first row (1), so all become 5. Which matches output.\n\nExample 2:\n\nFirst row [2,2,2]. Second row [8,8,2]. First two elements (8,8) different from first row's 2 \u2192 become 5. Third element same (2) \u2192 stays. So output [5,5,2]. Third row is same as first row \u2192 remains same. Which matches.\n\nExample 3:\n\nFirst input row [3,3,8]. Output first row is [5,5,5]. Wait, but according to previous logic, the first row should be compared to itself, so all elements would remain. But in example 3's output, the first row is changed. So this breaks the previous hypothesis. So perhaps there's another layer here.\n\nWait, in example 3's input, the first row is [3,3,8], which is not all the same. The third element is 8. So maybe the first row is treated differently if it's not all the same. Let's check.\n\nIn example 3's output, the first row becomes all 5s. So maybe if the first row has elements that are not all the same, then it's replaced with 5s. Let's see:\n\nLooking back at other examples:\n\nExample 0,1,2 all have first rows with all elements the same. Their outputs keep the first row same. Example 3's first row is [3,3,8] (not all same), so it's replaced with 5s. So that's a possible rule.\n\nSo the first row is kept if all elements are the same, otherwise replaced with 5s.\n\nThen, for the other rows (rows 2 and 3):\n\nFor each element in the row, if it's equal to the corresponding element in the first row of the input, then it stays. Otherwise, it's replaced with 5.\n\nWait, let's test this with example 3.\n\nInput first row: [3,3,8] (not all same), so output first row becomes [5,5,5].\n\nRow 2 input: [4,4,4]. Now, after the first row is transformed to all 5s, but wait, maybe the rule for other rows is comparing to the original first row, not the transformed one. Hmm, example 3's output for row 2 is [4,4,4]. But according to the rule: the original first row's elements are 3,3,8. Row 2's elements are 4,4,4. None are equal to the corresponding elements in the first row. So according to the rule, they should all be replaced with 5. But in the output, row 2 remains [4,4,4]. So this contradicts the hypothesis.\n\nSo maybe the other rows are compared to the transformed first row. But in example 3, the transformed first row is [5,5,5]. So row 2's elements (4,4,4) are not equal to 5, so they should all become 5. But output is [4,4,4]. So this doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. So this line of thinking is leading to a contradiction. Let me rethink.\n\nAnother approach: Maybe each element in the grid is replaced by 5 unless it's part of a contiguous block (horizontally or vertically adjacent) of the same number as the first element of the first row. Let's see.\n\nIn example 0: first row is all 2s. The first element of the first row is 2. So any contiguous block of 2s connected to the first row's 2s would stay, others become 5.\n\nLooking at input:\n\nRow 1: [2,2,2] (all 2s)\nRow 2: [2,1,8]\nRow 3: [2,8,8]\n\nIn the output, the 2 in row2, column1 stays (connected to first row's 2s), but 1 and 8 become 5. Similarly, row3's first element 2 is connected, so stays, but 8s become 5.\n\nBut in example 1:\n\nFirst row is all 1s. The other rows: row2 has 8,1,3. The 1 in row2, column2 is connected to the first row's 1s (vertically adjacent?), so stays. The 8 and 3 are not part of the 1 block, so become 5. Row3 has 8,2,2. None of these are 1s, so all become 5s.\n\nIn example 2:\n\nFirst row all 2s. Row2 has 8,8,2. The 2 in row2 column3 is connected to the first row's 2s (since row3 has 2s?), but maybe not. Wait, row3 in input is [2,2,2]. So row2's last element 2 is adjacent to row3's 2s. So maybe it's part of the block, so it remains. The 8s in row2 become 5. Row3 remains as is.\n\nIn example3:\n\nFirst row is [3,3,8], which is not all the same. So maybe the entire first row is considered as not a block, and all elements are replaced by 5. Then, the second row is [4,4,4]. But why does it stay? Because in the output, the second row remains. So perhaps the rule is different.\n\nThis approach seems plausible but not entirely matching all examples. Let's check example3's output. The output first row is all 5s. Second row remains [4,4,4]. Third row becomes all 5s. So why is the second row kept? If the first row's elements are all 5s, then perhaps the second row's elements are compared to the first row's 5s. If they are not 5, they become 5. But in this case, the second row's elements are 4, which are not 5, but in the output they remain. So that contradicts.\n\nHmm, maybe the rule is that rows after the first are compared to the first row (original input) and any element that matches the first row's corresponding position is kept, others replaced by 5. Except when the first row isn't uniform, then the entire first row becomes 5s, and subsequent rows are all 5s except if they are uniform. Wait, in example3, the output's second row is [4,4,4]. So even though the first row became 5s, the second row remains. So that suggests that maybe when the first row is not uniform, all rows except those that are uniform are replaced with 5s. Let me check.\n\nIn example3:\n\nOriginal first row [3,3,8] (not uniform). So output first row becomes all 5s. The second row is [4,4,4], which is uniform. So it's kept. The third row is [8,1,1], which is not uniform, so becomes all 5s.\n\nSo the rule could be:\n\n- If the first row is uniform (all elements the same), then:\n\n   - The first row remains the same.\n\n   - For each subsequent row, each element that is equal to the first element of the first row (the uniform value) is kept; others are replaced with 5.\n\n- If the first row is not uniform:\n\n   - The entire first row is replaced with 5s.\n\n   - For each subsequent row, if the row is uniform (all elements same), then it's kept as is. Otherwise, replace all elements with 5s.\n\nLet's test this against the examples.\n\nExample0:\n\nFirst row is [2,2,2] (uniform). So kept. Subsequent rows:\n\nRow2: [2,1,8]. Elements equal to 2 (the first element) are 2 (position 0). So kept. Others become 5 \u2192 [2,5,5].\n\nRow3: [2,8,8]. Same logic \u2192 [2,5,5]. Correct.\n\nExample1:\n\nFirst row is [1,1,1]. So uniform. Subsequent rows:\n\nRow2: [8,1,3]. Compare each element to 1. 8\u21925, 1 stays, 3\u21925 \u2192 [5,1,5].\n\nRow3: [8,2,2]. All elements not 1 \u2192 [5,5,5]. Correct.\n\nExample2:\n\nFirst row uniform. Subsequent rows:\n\nRow2: [8,8,2]. Compare each to 2. Only last element is 2 \u2192 [5,5,2].\n\nRow3 is same as first row \u2192 [2,2,2]. Correct.\n\nExample3:\n\nFirst row [3,3,8] (not uniform). So replace first row with 5s.\n\nThen, for other rows:\n\nRow2: [4,4,4] (uniform) \u2192 kept.\n\nRow3: [8,1,1] (not uniform) \u2192 replaced with 5s. Correct.\n\nThis seems to fit all examples.\n\nNow, let's apply this to the test input.\n\nTest Input:\n\n[1,3,2]\n\n[3,3,2]\n\n[1,3,2]\n\nFirst row is [1,3,2], which is not uniform. So first row becomes [5,5,5].\n\nNow, for the other rows:\n\nSecond row: [3,3,2]. Check if it's uniform. The elements are 3,3,2 \u2192 not uniform. So replace all with 5s \u2192 [5,5,5].\n\nThird row: [1,3,2] \u2192 same as first row input (which was [1,3,2]). But according to the rule, since the first row is not uniform, subsequent rows are replaced with 5s if they are not uniform. The third row is [1,3,2], which is not uniform. So replace with 5s.\n\nBut wait, in example3, the second row was [4,4,4] (uniform) and was kept. So in this test case, the second row is [3,3,2], which is not uniform (since 2 is different). So it should become all 5s. Third row is [1,3,2], also not uniform \u2192 all 5s.\n\nSo the output should be:\n\n[5,5,5]\n\n[5,5,5]\n\n[5,5,5]\n\nBut let's check if there's any other possibility. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me re-examine.\n\nTest input rows:\n\nRow0: [1,3,2] \u2192 not uniform \u2192 becomes [5,5,5].\n\nRow1: [3,3,2]. Are all elements same? No. So replace with 5s.\n\nRow2: [1,3,2]. Also not uniform. Replace with 5s.\n\nSo the output should be three rows of [5,5,5].\n\nBut let me check if the test input has any rows that are uniform. The second row in the test input is [3,3,2], which isn't uniform. Third row is same as first row (which is not uniform), so also not uniform.\n\nTherefore, all rows except possibly the first (which is transformed) are replaced with 5s.\n\nThus, the output is all 5s.\n\nBut looking back at the examples, in example3, the second row was uniform and kept. So in the test case, the second row is not uniform, so replaced. Third row also not uniform. So all output rows would be [5,5,5].",

        "cot_2": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. So, we have these training examples where each input is a 3x3 grid of numbers, and the output is another 3x3 grid. I need to see how the input transforms into the output. Let's start by looking at each example one by one.\n\nLooking at Example 0:\nInput:\n[2,2,2]\n[2,1,8]\n[2,8,8]\n\nOutput:\n[2,2,2]\n[2,5,5]\n[2,5,5]\n\nHmm. The first row remains the same. The second row changes the 1 and 8 to 5s. The third row also changes both 8s to 5s. So maybe when a number is not the same as the first element of its row or column, it becomes 5? Or perhaps there's something about the surrounding elements.\n\nWait, maybe the first row is all 2s, so the output keeps them. The second row starts with 2, then 1 and 8. In the output, the first element remains 2, and the others become 5. The third row starts with 2, then 8,8. Those 8s become 5s. So maybe if an element is different from the first element of its row, it turns into 5. Let's check that.\n\nIn Example 1:\nInput:\n[1,1,1]\n[8,1,3]\n[8,2,2]\n\nOutput:\n[1,1,1]\n[5,1,5]\n[5,5,5]\n\nThe first row is all 1s, so unchanged. Second row starts with 8, which is different from the first row's first element (1). Wait, maybe not. Wait, the rows are separate. So for each row, the first element is the 'anchor', and other elements that are not equal to it become 5s. Let's see.\n\nExample 0's second row is [2,1,8]. The first element is 2. The 1 and 8 are not 2, so they become 5. Third row starts with 2, the 8s become 5. That fits. Example1's second row [8,1,3]. First element 8. Then 1 and 3 are not 8, so they become 5? But the output is [5,1,5]. Wait, the second element is 1. Oh, that's not matching. Wait, maybe the rule is different. Let's look again.\n\nWait in Example1's input, second row is [8,1,3]. Output is [5,1,5]. So the first element 8 becomes 5, and the third becomes 5. But the middle element stays 1. Hmm. So maybe the first element is replaced with 5, and others are 5 if they are different from the first element of the first row? Or maybe it's based on the first row's elements.\n\nWait the first row of Example1's input is [1,1,1]. The output's second row starts with 5, which is different. Maybe there's a different rule. Let's think about columns instead. Maybe each column is considered. Let's see.\n\nAnother approach: look for the number 5 in outputs. 5 seems to appear a lot. Let's see when 5 is used. In Example0, the output's second row has 5s where the input was 1 and 8. Third row's 8s become 5. Example1's output has 5s replacing 8, 3, 8, 2, 2. Hmm. Maybe 5 replaces numbers that are not part of a sequence or not matching certain criteria.\n\nWait, looking at the third example:\n\nInput:\n[3,3,8]\n[4,4,4]\n[8,1,1]\n\nOutput:\n[5,5,5]\n[4,4,4]\n[5,5,5]\n\nSo the first row becomes all 5s. The middle row remains. The third row becomes all 5s. So what's different here? The middle row is all 4s, same as the first element. The first row's first element is 3, but the third element is 8. So in the output, the first row becomes 5s. The third row's first element is 8, which in the output becomes 5. So maybe the first element of each row is checked. If the entire row is not all the same as the first element, then the entire row becomes 5s. Wait, in Example0's input, the first row is all 2s, so remains. Second row starts with 2 but others are not, so those become 5. Third row starts with 2 but others are 8s, so they become 5. But in the output of Example0, the second row's first element is 2, then 5s. So maybe for each row, if the entire row is not uniform (all elements the same), then the elements that differ from the first element are replaced by 5. Wait, but in Example0's second row: input is [2,1,8]. Output [2,5,5]. So first element remains, others become 5. Similarly for third row. So the rule could be: For each row, the first element is kept. All other elements in the row are replaced with 5 if they are different from the first element. But wait, in Example3's first row input is [3,3,8]. The first element is 3. The third element is 8, so in the output, it's 5. But the output for that row is [5,5,5], not [3,3,5]. That contradicts the previous idea. So what's different here?\n\nWait in Example3, the first row is [3,3,8], but the entire output row is 5s. So that doesn't fit the previous idea. So maybe the rule is different. Let's re-examine Example3.\n\nIn Example3's input:\nFirst row: [3,3,8]\nSecond row: [4,4,4]\nThird row: [8,1,1]\n\nOutput:\nFirst row: [5,5,5]\nSecond row: same\nThird row: [5,5,5]\n\nSo why is the first row all 5s? Maybe if the row is not all the same as the first element, then all elements except the first are replaced by 5. Wait, but the first element is 3, and the row has two 3s and an 8. So if the first element is 3, and the other elements are 3 and 8. Then according to the previous rule, the first element stays, others are 5 if different. So the output should be [3,3,5]. But the actual output is [5,5,5]. So that doesn't fit. Therefore, the previous hypothesis is incorrect.\n\nAlternative approach: Maybe the entire grid is being checked for which numbers are in the corners or edges. Or perhaps the pattern is based on symmetry.\n\nLooking at Example3's input:\n\nFirst row: 3,3,8\n\nMiddle row: 4,4,4\n\nThird row:8,1,1\n\nThe output changes the first and third rows to all 5s. Middle row remains. So maybe if a row contains a mix of numbers, but the middle row is uniform. But how does that apply to other examples?\n\nWait, Example0's middle row is [2,1,8], which is not uniform. The output's middle row is [2,5,5]. The first element is kept, others turned to 5. Example1's middle row [8,1,3] becomes [5,1,5]. Wait, that's keeping the 1. Hmm, this complicates things.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's about the columns. For each column, if the elements are the same as the top element, they stay, else become 5. Let's check.\n\nIn Example0's input:\n\nColumns:\n\nColumn 0: 2,2,2 \u2192 all same. Output columns 0 are 2,2,2.\n\nColumn1: 2,1,8 \u2192 output 2,5,5. The top is 2, others are 1 and 8. So 1 and 8 become 5.\n\nColumn2: 2,8,8 \u2192 top is 2. So the 8s become 5. Output 2,5,5.\n\nSo this fits. Let's check Example1:\n\nInput columns:\n\nColumn0:1,8,8. Top is 1. So 8 and 8 would become 5. Output column0:1,5,5.\n\nOutput for Example1 is:\n\n[1,1,1]\n[5,1,5]\n[5,5,5]\n\nSo column0: 1,5,5 \u2192 which matches the idea. Column1:1,1,2. Top is 1. The third element is 2, which becomes 5. So output column1:1,1,5. But the actual output second row's middle is 1, and third row's middle is 5. So in the output, column1 is 1,1,5. But the actual output for the second row's middle is 1, third row's middle is 5. Yes, that fits. Column2:1,3,2. Top is 1. So all others become 5. So output column2 is 1,5,5. Which matches the output.\n\nSo the pattern might be: For each column, if an element is equal to the top element of that column, it remains the same. Otherwise, it becomes 5.\n\nLet's check this hypothesis with all examples.\n\nExample0:\n\nInput columns:\n\n0: 2,2,2 \u2192 all 2s. Output remains.\n\n1:2,1,8 \u2192 top is 2. The 1 and 8 become 5. So output column1 is 2,5,5.\n\n2:2,8,8 \u2192 top is 2. 8s become 5. So column2 becomes 2,5,5.\n\nWhich matches the output.\n\nExample1:\n\nColumns:\n\n0:1,8,8 \u2192 top is 1. So 8s become 5. Output column0:1,5,5.\n\n1:1,1,2 \u2192 top is 1. The 2 becomes 5. So column1:1,1,5.\n\n2:1,3,2 \u2192 top is1. All others become5. So column2:1,5,5.\n\nWhich matches the output.\n\nExample2:\n\nInput:\n\n[2,2,2]\n[8,8,2]\n[2,2,2]\n\nColumns:\n\n0:2,8,2 \u2192 top is 2. 8 becomes5, third is2. So column0:2,5,2.\n\nBut output is:\n\n[2,2,2]\n[5,5,2]\n[2,2,2]\n\nColumn0 output:2,5,2. Which matches.\n\nColumn1:2,8,2 \u2192 top is2. 8 becomes5, others stay. Output:2,5,2.\n\nBut actual output column1 for the middle row is5. So the middle row's second element is5. Which fits.\n\nColumn2:2,2,2. All same, so remains.\n\nSo hypothesis holds.\n\nExample3:\n\nInput:\n\n[3,3,8]\n[4,4,4]\n[8,1,1]\n\nColumns:\n\nColumn0:3,4,8 \u2192 top is3. 4 and8 become5. So output column0:3\u21925? Wait output for first row is [5,5,5]. Wait, according to the hypothesis, column0's top is3. The elements below are4 and8. So in column0, all elements except top would become5. So the first element remains3, but in the output, first row becomes5,5,5. That contradicts.\n\nHmm, so this suggests the hypothesis is incorrect. Because in Example3, the output's first row is all 5s. But according to the column hypothesis, the first column's top element is3. So the first element (3) would stay, and the others (4 and8) become5. So the first column would be [3,5,5], but the output's first row is [5,5,5]. So that's a problem.\n\nSo what's different in Example3?\n\nWait the input's first row is [3,3,8]. The output is [5,5,5]. So the entire row is replaced with 5s. But according to the column-based rule, the first element (3) should stay, and others would be compared to their column's top. Let's see:\n\nFor column1 in Example3:\n\nTop is3. The second row's element is4, which becomes5. Third row's element is1, becomes5. So column1 output:3,5,5. But the output's first row's second element is5. So the original 3 in the first row would stay as3, but it's turned into5. So that's conflicting.\n\nSo the previous hypothesis is not correct. Let's think again.\n\nAlternative approach: Maybe the rule is applied per row. Let's check each row.\n\nLooking at Example3's first row input: [3,3,8]. Output is [5,5,5]. So entire row turned to5. Why?\n\nIn Example0, the first row is all 2s, so remains. Second row starts with2, others become5. Third row starts with2, others become5. Example1's first row is all1s, remains. Second row starts with8, which is not1. So perhaps if a row is not uniform (all elements same as the first element), then all elements except the first are turned into5. But in Example3's first row, the elements are3,3,8. The first element is3. The third element is8. So according to this rule, the first element stays, others become5 if not equal to3. So output would be [3,3,5]. But the actual output is [5,5,5]. So that doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. So perhaps the entire row is checked. If all elements in the row are the same, leave as is. Otherwise, replace the entire row with5s. But Example0's first row is all2s, so remains. Second row is not, so replace non-2 elements with5. But the output for the second row in Example0 is [2,5,5]. So first element remains, others become5. So the entire row isn't replaced. So that's not the case.\n\nAlternative idea: The first row is treated specially. Maybe the first row must be uniform (all elements same). If not, the entire grid is transformed in some way. Let's check.\n\nIn Example3, the first row is [3,3,8], which is not uniform. So the output's first row is all5s, and the third row also all5s. Middle row is uniform, so stays. So maybe if a row is not uniform, it's turned into all5s. But wait, in Example0's second row [2,1,8], which is not uniform, but the output is [2,5,5], not all5s. So that contradicts.\n\nHmm. Maybe the transformation is different. Let's look for another pattern.\n\nLooking at the numbers that are replaced with5: 1, 3, 8, etc. Maybe they are non-5 numbers and if they are not part of a certain condition. Wait, 5 is a possible replacement. Let's think about the sum of the digits. Not sure.\n\nAlternative approach: Let's look at each cell and see how it's transformed.\n\nIn Example0:\n\nOriginal matrix:\n\nRow0: 2,2,2 \u2192 remains.\n\nRow1: 2,1,8 \u2192 becomes 2,5,5.\n\nRow2:2,8,8 \u2192 becomes 2,5,5.\n\nSo for rows 1 and 2, the first element stays, others become5.\n\nIn Example1:\n\nRow0:1,1,1 \u2192 remains.\n\nRow1:8,1,3 \u2192 becomes5,1,5.\n\nRow2:8,2,2 \u2192 becomes5,5,5.\n\nSo row1's middle element remains1, others become5. Row2's elements all become5.\n\nIn Example2:\n\nRow0:2,2,2 \u2192 remains.\n\nRow1:8,8,2 \u2192 becomes5,5,2.\n\nRow2:2,2,2 \u2192 remains.\n\nRow1's third element is2, same as first row's third element (2). So it stays, others become5.\n\nWait maybe the rule is that for each element, if it is the same as the element in the same position in the first row, it stays, else becomes5.\n\nLet's test this.\n\nIn Example0:\n\nFirst row is [2,2,2].\n\nRow1: elements are 2,1,8. The first element (2) matches first row's first element (2) \u2192 stays. The others (1,8) don't match the first row's same column (2,2), so become5.\n\nRow2: elements are2,8,8. First element matches first row's column0 (2) \u2192 stays. Others (8,8) vs first row's columns1 and2 (2,2) \u2192 8\u22602, so become5.\n\nThat fits Example0's output.\n\nExample1:\n\nFirst row [1,1,1].\n\nRow1:8,1,3. Compare to first row's columns:\n\n8 vs1 (column0) \u2192 no, becomes5.\n\n1 vs1 (column1) \u2192 yes, stays1.\n\n3 vs1 (column2) \u2192 becomes5.\n\nSo row1 becomes5,1,5. Which matches.\n\nRow2:8,2,2. Compare to first row's columns:\n\n8 vs1 \u2192 becomes5.\n\n2 vs1 \u2192 becomes5.\n\n2 vs1 \u2192 becomes5.\n\nSo row2 becomes5,5,5. Correct.\n\nExample3:\n\nFirst row input [3,3,8].\n\nBut first row's output is [5,5,5]. So according to this rule, first row's elements are compared to themselves. So all must be same. But first row's input is3,3,8. So the third element is8, which is not equal to3. So in this case, first row's elements are compared to themselves, but since they're not all same, according to the rule, elements that are different from first row's same column would become5. But first row's third column is8, which is different from first element3. So according to this rule, the third element would become5. But the output is all5s. Wait, let me re-express.\n\nIf the rule is: For each element (i,j), if it's equal to the first row's element in column j, then it stays; else, becomes5.\n\nIn Example3's input:\n\nFirst row is [3,3,8].\n\nRow0 (same as first row) \u2192 elements must be compared to themselves. So each element in row0 is compared to the first row's same column.\n\nElement (0,0):3 \u2192 equals first row's (0,0) \u2192 stays3.\n\nElement (0,1):3 \u2192 equals first row's (0,1) \u2192 stays3.\n\nElement (0,2):8 \u2192 equals first row's (0,2) \u2192 stays8. So output row0 should be [3,3,8]. But the actual output is [5,5,5]. So this contradicts. So this hypothesis is wrong.\n\nSo what's different here? The output for the first row in Example3 is all5s. So the first row's elements are being changed. Which suggests that the first row is not treated as the reference. So maybe the rule is different.\n\nAlternative idea: The first row's elements are all compared to the middle element of the entire grid. Let's check.\n\nIn Example0, the middle element is1. The first row is all2s. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the grid is divided into some symmetry. Looking at Example3's input:\n\n[3,3,8]\n[4,4,4]\n[8,1,1]\n\nOutput is:\n\n[5,5,5]\n[4,4,4]\n[5,5,5]\n\nSo the middle row remains. The other rows are turned into5s. Maybe rows that are not uniform (all same) are turned into5s, except the middle row which is uniform. But Example0's middle row is not uniform, but it's transformed into [2,5,5]. So this idea doesn't fit.\n\nAnother approach: Maybe the sum of each row. Let's calculate sums.\n\nExample0:\n\nRow0: 6 \u2192 output 6.\n\nRow1:11 \u2192 output 12 (2+5+5=12). Not sure.\n\nExample1:\n\nRow0:3 \u2192 output3.\n\nRow1:12 \u2192 output11 (5+1+5=11). Not clear.\n\nHmm. Not obvious.\n\nAnother angle: Looking at the outputs, sometimes entire rows are turned into5s. Like Example3's first and third rows. So when does that happen?\n\nIn Example3, the first and third rows are turned into all5s. The middle row is uniform (4,4,4). So maybe if a row is not uniform, turn all its elements into5. But in Example0's second row [2,1,8] is not uniform, but becomes [2,5,5]. So the first element stays, others turn to5. So that contradicts.\n\nWait, maybe if the row contains a mix of numbers but the middle element is different from the first, then replace all except first. Or something involving the middle element.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that for each row, if all elements are the same, leave as is. If not, replace all elements except the first with5. But in Example0's second row, that's what happens. Third row: [2,8,8] becomes [2,5,5]. So yes. Example1's second row [8,1,3] becomes [5,1,5]. Wait, the first element is8, but output is5. So that doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. Example1's second row output is [5,1,5]. So first element is5, which is not the same as input's8. So that idea is incorrect.\n\nAlternative idea: Maybe the middle element of the entire grid is special. For Example0's input, middle element is1. But output middle is5. Not sure.\n\nWait, looking at the test input:\n\nTest Input:\n[1,3,2]\n[3,3,2]\n[1,3,2]\n\nIf we apply the column-based rule where each element must match the first row's column. So:\n\nFirst row is [1,3,2].\n\nSo columns:\n\nColumn0:1,3,1. So elements must match 1. So in row1, column0 is3 \u2192 becomes5. Row2 column0 is1 \u2192 stays1.\n\nColumn1:3,3,3. All elements are3 \u2192 stay3.\n\nColumn2:2,2,2. All elements stay2.\n\nSo the output would be:\n\n[1,3,2]\n\n[5,3,2]\n\n[1,3,2]\n\nBut this doesn't match the format of the training examples. For example, in Example3, the first row's output was all5s. So perhaps that's not the right rule.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is that for each element, if it is the same as the element in the same position in the first row, it stays; otherwise, it becomes5. Let's check.\n\nTest input:\n\nRow0: [1,3,2]\n\nRow1: [3,3,2]\n\nRow2: [1,3,2]\n\nSo comparing each element to row0's same column:\n\nRow1, column0:3 vs row0's 1 \u2192 becomes5.\n\nRow1, column1:3 vs row0's3 \u2192 stays3.\n\nRow1, column2:2 vs row0's2 \u2192 stays2.\n\nRow2, column0:1 vs row0's1 \u2192 stays1.\n\nRow2, columns1 and2:3 and2 \u2192 same as row0's, so stay.\n\nSo output would be:\n\n[1,3,2]\n\n[5,3,2]\n\n[1,3,2]\n\nBut looking at the training examples, when the middle row is changed, sometimes the first element is kept (like Example0's second row becomes [2,5,5]). But according to this rule, the first element of row1 is3, which compared to row0's column0 (1) \u2192 becomes5. So output's row1 would be [5,3,2].\n\nBut looking at the training examples, this doesn't match. For instance, Example3's first row becomes all5s. Let's apply this rule to Example3:\n\nExample3's input:\n\nRow0:3,3,8\n\nRow1:4,4,4\n\nRow2:8,1,1\n\nCompare each element to row0's same column:\n\nRow0's elements are3,3,8. So:\n\nRow0:3 (matches),3 (matches),8 (matches). So stays as is. But output row0 is all5s. So this doesn't fit. So this hypothesis is incorrect.\n\nAlternative approach: Let's look for a different pattern.\n\nAnother observation: In the outputs, the number5 appears frequently. Let's see:\n\nLooking at Example3's output, the first and third rows are all5s. Middle row remains4s. So perhaps any row that is not the middle row and is not uniform (all same) becomes all5s, while the middle row is kept if it's uniform. But in Example0, the middle row is not uniform, but it's transformed into [2,5,5]. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the middle row is treated specially. If the middle row is uniform, then it's kept. Other rows that are not uniform are replaced with5s. But Example0's middle row is not uniform (2,1,8) and it's transformed to [2,5,5], not all5s.\n\nHmm. This is challenging. Let's try to think of another angle.\n\nLooking at the outputs, in Example3, the middle row is uniform and remains. The other rows are all5s. So perhaps the rule is: For each row except the middle row, if it is uniform (all elements same), then it remains, else all elements become5. Middle row is kept as is. But in Example0's first row is uniform, so remains. Second row is not uniform, becomes [2,5,5]. Which doesn't fit. So that's not correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the middle row's elements are kept as is, and other rows are transformed. But in Example0's middle row is transformed.\n\nAnother idea: The number5 replaces any element that is not part of a trio in its row or column. For example, in a row, if there's a single different number, it becomes5. But in Example0's second row, 1 and8 are replaced by5, which were the unique elements.\n\nWait, maybe the rule is: For each row, if there is a number that appears in the majority, keep those and replace others with5. If no majority, replace all with5. But Example0's second row has 2 once,1 once,8 once. No majority, but the first element is kept. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the first element of each row is kept, and the others are replaced with5 if they are different. But in Example3's first row, the first element is3, but the output row is all5s. So that's conflicting.\n\nAnother approach: Looking at the sum of the digits. For instance, in Example0's input rows:\n\nRow0: sum 6 \u2192 output 6.\n\nRow1: sum 11 \u2192 output 12 (2+5+5).\n\nRow2: sum 18 \u2192 output 12 (2+5+5).\n\nNot sure. Example1:\n\nRow0 sum3 \u2192 output3.\n\nRow1 sum12 \u2192 output11 (5+1+5).\n\nRow2 sum12 \u2192 output15 (5+5+5).\n\nNo obvious pattern.\n\nAlternative idea: Maybe the transformation is based on the position of the element. For example, elements not on the edges (center) are treated differently. But in Example0, the center element in the second row is1, which becomes5. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that every element except those in the middle column and the first row is replaced with5. Doesn't fit.\n\nWait, looking at Example3's output, the middle row is kept as is. The other rows are all5s. So perhaps if the middle row is uniform, then it's kept. Other rows are replaced with5s if they are not uniform. But in Example3's first row is not uniform, so replaced. Third row is not uniform, replaced. But in Example0, the middle row is not uniform, but transformed into [2,5,5], not all5s. So that doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. I'm stuck. Let me look for another pattern.\n\nLooking at the test input:\n\n[1,3,2]\n[3,3,2]\n[1,3,2]\n\nIf I apply the column-based rule where each element must match the top of the column, except for the middle row. But I'm not sure.\n\nWait, in the training examples, the outputs often have5s in positions where the input elements differ from the first row's same column.\n\nFor example, in Example0's input:\n\nColumns:\n\nColumn0:2,2,2 \u2192 output all2.\n\nColumn1:2,1,8 \u2192 output2,5,5.\n\nColumn2:2,8,8 \u2192 output2,5,5.\n\nSo if in a column, any element differs from the top element, it's replaced by5. Except for the top element itself. So the top element stays, and others are compared to it. If they are different, they become5.\n\nYes, this seems to fit.\n\nLet's check Example3:\n\nColumns:\n\nColumn0:3,4,8. Top is3. So 4 and8 are different, so become5. So column0 becomes [3,5,5]. But the output's column0 is [5,4,5]. Wait, the first row in output is [5,5,5]. So this contradicts.\n\nHmm, so that can't be right. But according to this, Example3's first row's first element would be3, but the output is5. So this hypothesis fails here.\n\nBut why in Example3, the first row's first element is3 but becomes5 in the output.\n\nWait, maybe the entire row is compared to the middle row. For example, if a row is not the same as the middle row, then replace with5s. But Example3's middle row is [4,4,4]. The first row is [3,3,8], which is different. So replaced with5s. Third row is [8,1,1], also different \u2192 replaced with5s. But how does this apply to other examples.\n\nExample0's middle row is [2,1,8]. The other rows are [2,2,2] and [2,8,8]. So if the rule is to replace rows that are not the same as the middle row, then first and third rows would be replaced. But in the output, the first row remains. So that's not.\n\nAlternatively, if the middle row is uniform, then non-uniform rows are replaced. But in Example3's middle row is uniform (4,4,4), so other rows are replaced. In Example0's middle row is not uniform, so other rows are transformed differently. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is: For each column, if the middle element of that column is the same as the top element, then keep the elements below; otherwise, replace with5.\n\nBut this is getting complicated.\n\nLet me try to think of another way. Looking at all examples:\n\nThe output often has 5s in places where the input had different numbers, but not always. The middle row sometimes is preserved if it's uniform. Maybe the pattern is:\n\n- If a row is uniform (all elements same), it stays.\n\n- If a row is not uniform, then for each element in that row, if it's the same as the corresponding element in the first row, it stays; else, becomes5.\n\nLet's check this.\n\nExample0:\n\nFirst row is uniform \u2192 stays.\n\nSecond row is not uniform. Compare each element to first row's same column.\n\nFirst element:2 (same as first row's column0 \u2192 stays).\n\nSecond element:1 vs first row's column1 (2) \u2192 becomes5.\n\nThird element:8 vs first row's column2 (2) \u2192 becomes5. So output [2,5,5]. Correct.\n\nThird row is not uniform. Compare elements:\n\nFirst element:2 (same as first row's column0 \u2192 stays).\n\nSecond and third elements:8 vs first row's columns1 and2 (2) \u2192 become5. So [2,5,5]. Correct.\n\nExample1:\n\nFirst row is uniform \u2192 stays.\n\nSecond row: elements compared to first row's columns:\n\n8 vs1 \u2192 becomes5.\n\n1 vs1 \u2192 stays.\n\n3 vs1 \u2192 becomes5. So [5,1,5]. Correct.\n\nThird row: elements compared to first row's columns:\n\n8 vs1 \u21925.\n\n2 vs1 \u21925.\n\n2 vs1 \u21925. So [5,5,5]. Correct.\n\nExample3:\n\nFirst row is not uniform. So compare each element to first row's same column (but since first row is not uniform, this would be themselves? Wait no. Wait the first row's elements are [3,3,8]. So for the first row, since it's not uniform, but the rule says if a row is uniform it stays, else compare to first row. Wait the rule was:\n\n- If a row is uniform, stay.\n\n- Else, compare each element to first row's corresponding column. If same, stay; else5.\n\nSo in Example3:\n\nFirst row is not uniform. So compare each element to first row's same column (which is themselves). So they all stay. But output is [5,5,5]. Contradiction.\n\nHmm, so this doesn't work.\n\nAlternative idea: Maybe if the entire grid's middle row is uniform, then all rows that are not uniform are replaced with5s. Otherwise, process each row individually.\n\nIn Example3, the middle row is uniform. So first and third rows are not uniform \u2192 replaced with5s.\n\nIn Example0 and Example1, the middle rows are not uniform, so they are processed by comparing to the first row's columns.\n\nExample2's input:\n\n[2,2,2]\n[8,8,2]\n[2,2,2]\n\nMiddle row is [8,8,2]. Not uniform. So process each element of middle row compared to first row's columns.\n\nFirst element:8 vs first row's column0 (2) \u2192 becomes5.\n\nSecond element:8 vs first row's column1 (2) \u2192 becomes5.\n\nThird element:2 vs first row's column2 (2) \u2192 stays. So middle row becomes [5,5,2]. Which matches the output.\n\nThird row is uniform \u2192 stays.\n\nExample3's input has a uniform middle row (4,4,4). So first and third rows, which are not uniform, are replaced with5s. Which matches the output.\n\nSo the rule could be:\n\n- If the middle row is uniform, then any row (except the middle) that is not uniform is replaced with all5s. The middle row is kept as is.\n\n- If the middle row is not uniform, then for each row, any element that is not the same as the first row's corresponding column is replaced with5.\n\nBut how to confirm.\n\nLet's check Example3:\n\nMiddle row is uniform (4,4,4). So first and third rows are not uniform \u2192 replaced with5s. Correct.\n\nExample0:\n\nMiddle row is not uniform. So process each row: elements not matching first row's column are replaced with5.\n\nFirst row is uniform \u2192 stays.\n\nSecond row: elements compared to first row's columns.\n\n2 (same) \u2192 stays, 1 and8 become5.\n\nThird row: same as second row processing.\n\nCorrect.\n\nExample1:\n\nMiddle row is not uniform. Process each row's elements.\n\nFirst row uniform \u2192 stays.\n\nSecond row: compare to first row's columns \u2192 becomes5,1,5.\n\nThird row: compare to first row's columns \u2192 becomes5,5,5.\n\nCorrect.\n\nExample2:\n\nMiddle row is not uniform. Process each row.\n\nFirst row uniform \u2192 stays.\n\nMiddle row elements compared to first row's columns: 8\u21925,8\u21925,2 stays.\n\nThird row uniform \u2192 stays.\n\nCorrect.\n\nSo this seems to fit.\n\nNow, applying this to the test input:\n\nTest Input:\n\n[1,3,2]\n[3,3,2]\n[1,3,2]\n\nFirst, check if the middle row is uniform.\n\nMiddle row is [3,3,2]. Not uniform (third element is2). So we process each element in each row.\n\nFor each element in each row (except the first row, which is processed if it's not uniform), compare to the first row's corresponding column.\n\nFirst row: [1,3,2]. Check if it's uniform. The elements are 1,3,2 \u2192 not uniform. So for the first row, each element must be compared to the first row's column, but since it's the first row, perhaps this rule doesn't apply. Wait, according to the rule:\n\nIf the middle row is not uniform, then for each row, any element that is not the same as the first row's corresponding column is replaced with5.\n\nSo for all rows, including the first row.\n\nFirst row: compare each element to the first row's columns. So:\n\nRow0: elements are1,3,2. Each element must match their own column's first row value. So they are all same \u2192 stay. So row0 remains [1,3,2].\n\nRow1: [3,3,2]. Compare to first row's columns:\n\n3 vs1 (column0) \u2192 becomes5.\n\n3 vs3 (column1) \u2192 stays3.\n\n2 vs2 (column2) \u2192 stays2. So row1 becomes [5,3,2].\n\nRow2: [1,3,2]. Compare to first row's columns:\n\n1 vs1 \u2192 stays1.\n\n3 vs3 \u2192 stays3.\n\n2 vs2 \u2192 stays2. So row2 remains [1,3,2].\n\nThus, the output should be:\n\n[1,3,2]\n[5,3,2]\n[1,3,2]\n\nBut looking at the training examples, when the first row is not uniform, like in Example3's input, the first row was replaced with5s. But according to this rule, in the test input's first row, which is not uniform, but when processing each element by comparing to the first row's columns (which they match), they would stay. So first row remains as is.\n\nBut in Example3's input, the first row was not uniform and was replaced with5s. So this contradicts.\n\nWait in Example3, according to the rule, since the middle row is uniform, any other non-uniform rows are replaced with5s. So the first and third rows are non-uniform \u2192 replaced with5s.\n\nAh, right! So the test input's middle row is not uniform, so the rule for non-uniform middle rows applies: compare each element to first row's column. But the first row is not uniform, but according to the rule, that's okay. So the test input's output would be:\n\n[1,3,2]\n[5,3,2]\n[1,3,2]\n\nBut looking at the training examples, in Example0, the first row is uniform and remains. In Example1, first row is uniform and remains. Example2's first row is uniform and remains. Example3's first row is not uniform but is replaced with5s because the middle row is uniform.\n\nSo the test case's middle row is not uniform, so process each element by comparing to first row's column. So the first row remains as is, even if it's not uniform.\n\nBut in Example3's first row is not uniform, and it's replaced with5s because the middle row is uniform. So the rule is:\n\nIf middle row is uniform:\n\n- All non-uniform rows (other than the middle) become all5s.\n\nIf middle row is not uniform:\n\n- For each row, elements not matching the first row's column become5.\n\nSo in the test input:\n\nMiddle row is not uniform. So for all rows, elements not matching the first row's column become5.\n\nFirst row: elements are1,3,2. Each element matches their own column's first row value \u2192 stay.\n\nSecond row: elements3,3,2. Column0:3 vs1 \u21925. Column1:3 vs3 \u21923. Column2:2 vs2 \u21922. So row becomes[5,3,2].\n\nThird row: elements1,3,2. All match first row's columns \u2192 stay.\n\nSo output is:\n\n[1,3,2]\n\n[5,3,2]\n\n[1,3,2]\n\nBut looking at the training examples, the outputs often have 5s in positions where the input differed, but in the test input's case, the output has a row [5,3,2]. However, in the training examples like Example0, the middle row is transformed similarly.\n\nBut looking back at the training examples:\n\nExample3's input had middle row uniform, so first and third rows became all5s.\n\nExample0's middle row is not uniform, so elements in each row are compared to first row's columns.\n\nSo the test input's output should be:\n\n[1,3,2]\n\n[5,3,2]\n\n[1,3,2]\n\nBut looking at the format of the training outputs, for example:\n\nExample0's output:\n\n[2,2,2]\n\n[2,5,5]\n\n[2,5,5]\n\nEach row is transformed such that elements differing from the first row's column become5.\n\nSo the test input's output should follow this pattern."
