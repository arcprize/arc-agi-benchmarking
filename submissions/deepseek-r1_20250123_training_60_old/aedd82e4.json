        "cot_1": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. So, we have these input and output matrices, and I need to see how they transform. Let me look at the training examples one by one.\n\nStarting with Example 0. The input is three rows:\n\n[0, 2, 2]\n[0, 2, 2]\n[2, 0, 0]\n\nAnd the output is:\n\n[0, 2, 2]\n[0, 2, 2]\n[1, 0, 0]\n\nHmm, the only change is the last row's first element changed from 2 to 1. So maybe that's a clue. But why?\n\nLooking at Example 1. The input is a 4x4 matrix. The output has some 2s turned into 1s. For instance, in the third row, the last element becomes 1. In the fourth row, the second element becomes 1. Let's check the positions. In the input, those elements were 2, and in the output, they are 1. But other 2s remain. So maybe there's a condition where certain 2s get converted to 1.\n\nExample 2's input is a 5x4 matrix. The output changes the fourth element of the third row from 2 to 1. Other 2s stay as 2. So again, a single 2 becomes 1. What's special about that position?\n\nExample 3's input is a 3x3 matrix. The output changes the third element of the second row from 2 to 1, and the second element of the third row from 2 to 1. Wait, the input here has a 2 in those positions. So two changes here.\n\nSo, the pattern seems to involve changing certain 2s into 1s. But under what conditions?\n\nLet me think about the positions where the 2s are changed. Let's see:\n\nIn Example 0, the changed element is at row 3, column 1. In the input, that was a 2. The output becomes 1.\n\nIn Example 1, the changed elements are at row 3, column 4 (from 2 to 1), and row 4, column 2 (from 2 to 1). \n\nIn Example 2, row 3, column 4 (2 to 1).\n\nIn Example 3, row 2, column 3 (2 to 1) and row 3, column 2 (2 to 1).\n\nWait, maybe the 2s that are changed are those that are adjacent (maybe diagonally or orthogonally) to a 0? Or perhaps they are isolated 2s?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is that a 2 is turned into 1 if it is the only 2 in its row and column, but that might not fit all examples. Let's test.\n\nTake Example 0's changed element. The third row is [2,0,0]. The 2 is the only non-zero in that row. But in the output, it's changed to 1. Maybe if a 2 is the only one in its row and column, but not sure.\n\nExample 1's third row had [0,0,0,2], so that 2 is the only one in the row, and in the output becomes 1. The fourth row had [0,2,0,0], and the 2 becomes 1. Both of those rows have a single 2. So maybe when a 2 is the only one in its row, it's changed to 1. But in Example 3's second row [2,0,2], changing the third element to 1. Wait, that row has two 2s. So that contradicts the previous idea.\n\nHmm, maybe the direction is different. Let's look at the positions again. Maybe it's about the 2s that are adjacent to the bottom or right edges. Or maybe the 2s that are in certain positions relative to other elements.\n\nWait, another approach: looking for 2s that are the \"last\" in their row or column. For example, in Example 0, the 2 is the first element in the third row. But why would that be changed? Maybe it's the rightmost 2 in the row? Let's check.\n\nIn Example 0, third row input is [2,0,0]. The only 2 is the first element, which becomes 1. So maybe if a 2 is followed by zeros in the same row, then it's converted to 1.\n\nWait, looking at Example 1's third row input [0,0,0,2]. The 2 is the last element, followed by nothing. So that becomes 1. In the fourth row [0,2,0,0], the 2 is the second element, followed by zeros. That becomes 1. So maybe the rule is: in each row, the rightmost 2 (the last occurrence of 2) is converted to 1. Let's check this.\n\nIn Example 0, third row [2,0,0], the rightmost 2 is the first one. Wait, no. Wait, the third row's elements are 2,0,0. So the first element is 2, then zeros. The rightmost 2 is the first element? No, the rightmost is the first element here. That can't be. Wait, the row is [2,0,0], so the only 2 is at index 0. So the rightmost 2 is index 0. Then according to the rule, convert that to 1, which matches the output.\n\nIn Example 1, third row [0,0,0,2], the rightmost 2 is the last element (index 3). Convert to 1. Fourth row [0,2,0,0], rightmost 2 is index 1. Convert to 1. That fits.\n\nExample 2: third row input is [2,2,0,2]. The rightmost 2 is at index 3. So change that to 1. Which matches the output.\n\nExample 3: second row input [2,0,2]. The rightmost 2 is index 2. Change to 1. Third row input [0,2,0], the rightmost 2 is index 1. Change to 1. So the output matches that.\n\nSo the pattern seems to be: For each row in the input matrix, find the rightmost occurrence of 2, and change it to 1. All other 2s remain 2. If a row has no 2s, leave it as is.\n\nTesting this against the examples:\n\nExample 0: All rows except third have 2s. The third row's rightmost (and only) 2 is changed to 1. Correct.\n\nExample 1: Third row's rightmost 2 (last element) becomes 1. Fourth row's rightmost 2 (second element) becomes 1. Correct.\n\nExample 2: Third row's rightmost 2 (fourth element) becomes 1. Other rows have 2s, but their rightmost is left as 2. Correct.\n\nExample 3: Second row's rightmost 2 (third element) becomes 1. Third row's rightmost 2 (second element) becomes 1. Correct.\n\nSo the rule is: In each row, change the rightmost 2 to 1. All other elements remain the same.\n\nNow, applying this to the test input:\n\nTest Input:\n\n[2, 2, 0, 2]\n[0, 2, 0, 0]\n[0, 0, 2, 0]\n[2, 0, 0, 0]\n[0, 0, 2, 2]\n\nLet's process each row:\n\nFirst row: [2,2,0,2]. The 2s are at positions 0,1,3. Rightmost is position 3. Change to 1. So becomes [2,2,0,1].\n\nSecond row: [0,2,0,0]. The 2 is at position 1. Rightmost, so change to 1. \u2192 [0,1,0,0].\n\nThird row: [0,0,2,0]. 2 at position 2. Rightmost, change to 1. \u2192 [0,0,1,0].\n\nFourth row: [2,0,0,0]. Only 2 at position 0. Change to 1. \u2192 [1,0,0,0].\n\nFifth row: [0,0,2,2]. 2s at positions 2 and 3. Rightmost is 3. Change to 1. \u2192 [0,0,2,1].\n\nSo the output matrix should be:\n\n[2, 2, 0, 1]\n[0, 1, 0, 0]\n[0, 0, 1, 0]\n[1, 0, 0, 0]\n[0, 0, 2, 1]\n\nLet me cross-verify with the training examples. For example, in the fifth row of the test input, the original is [0,0,2,2]. Changing the last 2 to 1. So yes, that's correct.\n\nAnother check: the fourth row in test input was [2,0,0,0]. The rightmost 2 is the first element. Change to 1. So becomes [1,0,0,0]. That's correct.\n\nTherefore, the final output should be as above.",

        "cot_2": "Okay, let's look at these examples to figure out the pattern. So, the input is a 2D array of numbers (0, 1, 2), and the output seems to modify some of these numbers. Let me check each example carefully.\n\nStarting with Example 0. The input is three rows:\n\n[0,2,2]\n[0,2,2]\n[2,0,0]\n\nThe output changes the third row's first element from 2 to 1, resulting in [1,0,0]. The rest remain the same. Hmm, why that position?\n\nIn Example 1, the input is a 4x4 grid. The output changes two elements. The third row's last element becomes 1, and the fourth row's second element becomes 1. Let me check their positions. Maybe looking at the surrounding cells? Or perhaps something to do with the number of 2s around them?\n\nWait, maybe it's about the number of adjacent 2s. For instance, in Example 0, the changed cell (third row, first column) is originally 2. In the output, it becomes 1. Let's see if there's a rule where a 2 becomes 1 if certain conditions are met, like being adjacent to other 2s.\n\nWait, but in Example 0, the cell that changed is at (2,0) (assuming 0-based index). Let's see its neighbors. The cells around it would be (1,0) which is 0, (2,1) which is 0. To the left, there's nothing, and above is 0. So maybe not that. Alternatively, perhaps it's about being in a position where there are exactly two 2s in the same row or column?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s that are \"exposed\" or have a certain number of adjacent 0s. Let's check another example.\n\nLooking at Example 3. Input:\n\n[2,2,0]\n[2,0,2]\n[0,2,0]\n\nOutput changes the middle cell in the second row (from 2 to 1) and the middle cell in the third row (from 2 to 1). Wait, the third row's middle cell was originally 2? Let me check. Input third row is [0,2,0], so the middle is 2. In output, it becomes 1. So the 2 becomes 1 here.\n\nWait, but why? Let's see their positions. In the second row of input, the third element is 2. Output changes that to 1. The surrounding elements: above is 0 (from first row, third column), left is 0 (same row, second column), right is nothing. Maybe the cell is a 2 that is adjacent to exactly one other 2? Let's think.\n\nIn Example 0, the changed cell was a 2. Its adjacent cells (left is same row, column 1 is 0, above is row 1, column 0 which is 0, below none). So maybe the number of adjacent 2s determines whether it becomes 1. If a 2 has less than a certain number of adjacent 2s, it becomes 1.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule is that any 2 which is not part of a group (like isolated) gets converted to 1. But how to determine that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's the 2s that are at the end of a line or in certain positions. Let me check Example 1's output. The third row's last element becomes 1. The original was 2. The cells around it: left is 0, above is 0 (row 2, column 3 is 0?), maybe. So perhaps 2s that are surrounded by 0s get turned into 1s.\n\nWait, in Example 0, the third row's first element was 2. The cells to the right (0,0) would be [2,0,0], so right is 0. Above is [0,2,2], so the cell above (row 1, column 0) is 0. So that 2 is surrounded by 0s. So maybe when a 2 is surrounded by two or more 0s in adjacent positions (like left, right, above, below), it becomes 1.\n\nBut in Example 1, the third row's last element (column 3) was 2. The adjacent cells would be left (column 2) which is 0, above (row 2, column 3) is 0 (from input row 3 is [0,0,0,2], wait no: input in Example 1 is:\n\nInput rows for Example 1:\n\n[2,2,2,0]\n[0,2,0,0]\n[0,0,0,2]\n[0,2,0,0]\n\nSo third row is [0,0,0,2]. Then fourth row is [0,2,0,0]. Wait, the third row's last element is 2, and in the output it becomes 1. Let's look at adjacent cells:\n\nTo the left is 0 (same row, column 2), above is row 2, column 3 (which is 0, from row 2 [0,2,0,0], wait no: original input for Example 1's third row is [0,0,0,2], but wait the input rows are:\n\nRow 0: [2,2,2,0]\n\nRow 1: [0,2,0,0]\n\nRow 2: [0,0,0,2]\n\nRow 3: [0,2,0,0]\n\nSo the cell at row 2, column 3 (third row, fourth element) is 2. In the output, it becomes 1. Let's check its adjacent cells:\n\nTop: row 1, column 3 is 0.\n\nLeft: row 2, column 2 is 0.\n\nBottom: row 3, column 3 is 0.\n\nRight: none (since it's the last column).\n\nSo adjacent to 0s except maybe the cell below. The cell below (row 3, column 3) is 0. So the 2 is surrounded by 0s. So maybe that's why it becomes 1.\n\nSimilarly, in Example 3's input:\n\nSecond row is [2,0,2]. The third element (2) becomes 1. Let's check its adjacent cells. Left is 0, above is row 1, column 2 (which is 0 in input?), no. Wait input row 1 is [2,0,2], so column 2 is 2. Wait no, row 0 is [2,2,0], row 1 is [2,0,2], row 2 is [0,2,0]. So the cell at row 1, column 2 (which is 2) becomes 1. Let's check adjacent cells:\n\nTop: row 0, column 2 is 0.\n\nLeft: row 1, column 1 is 0.\n\nRight: row 1, column 3 (doesn't exist, since it's a 3-element row).\n\nBottom: row 2, column 2 is 0.\n\nSo adjacent to 0s except maybe up or down. So perhaps if a 2 has exactly one adjacent 2, or perhaps if it's isolated.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is to change a 2 to 1 if it has exactly two adjacent 0s. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is to change the rightmost 2 in each row to 1, but looking at Example 0: third row was [2,0,0], and the first element was changed to 1, which is the leftmost. So that's not it.\n\nWait, maybe the 2s that are in positions where the cell to their right is a 0. Let's check Example 0: the third row's first element is 2, and to the right is 0. So maybe if a 2 has a 0 to the right, it becomes 1. But in Example 1, the third row's last element (2) becomes 1. There's no cell to the right (it's the last column), so maybe that's considered as having a 0 to the right (since it's the edge). Or maybe the direction is different.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's about being the first or last 2 in a row. In Example 0's third row, the 2 is the first element and the only 2. So maybe changing the first 2 in each row to 1. But in Example 1, the third row's last 2 is changed. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule is that any 2 which is followed by a 0 in the same row (to the right) is replaced by 1. Let's check:\n\nExample 0: Third row is [2,0,0]. The 2 is followed by 0. So becomes 1. That works.\n\nExample 1: The third row is [0,0,0,2]. The 2 is the last element, followed by nothing. Maybe edge cases count as 0. So it's followed by 0 (since it's the end), so it becomes 1.\n\nAnother change in Example 1 is the fourth row's second element (2 becomes 1). The row is [0,2,0,0]. The 2 is at position 1. To its right is 0. So that fits the pattern.\n\nIn Example 3's second row, the third element (2) is followed by nothing (since it's the last element). So it's followed by 0 (edge), so becomes 1. The third row's middle element is 2 in input, becomes 1. Let's see that row: [0,2,0]. The 2 is followed by 0. So yes, that fits.\n\nExample 2's input:\n\nThird row is [2,2,0,2]. Output becomes [2,2,0,1]. The last 2 is followed by nothing (so edge), so becomes 1. The others are followed by non-zero? The first two 2s are followed by 2 and 0 respectively. So only the last 2 is followed by 0 (edge).\n\nSo the pattern seems to be: For each row, look at each element. If the element is a 2, and the element immediately to the right is a 0 (or the end of the row, which is considered as 0), then change it to 1. Otherwise, leave it as is.\n\nWait, but in Example 3's third row, [0,2,0]. The 2 is at position 1. The element to the right is 0. So it becomes 1. That fits.\n\nSo the rule would be: In each row, replace every 2 that is followed by a 0 (or is the last element in the row) with 1.\n\nWait, but the edge case for the last element: if it's a 2, since there's nothing to the right, it's considered as followed by 0. So replace with 1.\n\nTesting this:\n\nExample 0's third row: [2,0,0]. The first element is 2, followed by 0. So becomes 1. The output is [1,0,0]. Which matches.\n\nExample 1's third row last element: 2, followed by end (considered 0) \u2192 becomes 1.\n\nFourth row's second element (2) is followed by 0 \u2192 becomes 1.\n\nIn Example 2's third row, the last element is 2. Followed by end \u2192 becomes 1. The output shows that.\n\nSo this seems to fit all the examples.\n\nNow, applying this to the test input:\n\nTest Input:\n\n[2,2,0,2]\n[0,2,0,0]\n[0,0,2,0]\n[2,0,0,0]\n[0,0,2,2]\n\nProcessing each row:\n\nRow 0: [2,2,0,2]\n\nCheck each 2:\n\n- First element (2): next is 2 (so not 0) \u2192 remains 2.\n\n- Second element (2): next is 0 \u2192 replace with 1.\n\n- Fourth element (2): next is end \u2192 replace with 1.\n\nSo the row becomes [2,1,0,1].\n\nWait, but according to the examples, in Example 1's first row is [2,2,2,0], which in output remains the same. But according to this rule, the third 2 in that row is followed by 0, which would change to 1, but in the example output, it remains 2. Wait, this contradicts.\n\nWait, Example 1's input row 0 is [2,2,2,0]. The output is [2,2,2,0]. So according to the rule I thought, the third 2 (position 2) is followed by 0 (position 3), which would be replaced by 1, but in the output it's still 2. Hmm, this contradicts the previous hypothesis. So my initial pattern is wrong.\n\nWait, this is a problem. Let me re-examine Example 1. Input row 0 is [2,2,2,0], output is the same. According to my previous rule, the third 2 (index 2) is followed by 0 (index 3 is 0), so it should become 1. But in the output, it's still 2. So the rule must be different.\n\nSo my previous idea is invalid. Need to think again.\n\nAlternative approach: Maybe the transformation is not row-wise but column-wise. Let's check the examples again.\n\nLooking at Example 0:\n\nOriginal:\n\nRow 0: [0,2,2]\n\nRow 1: [0,2,2]\n\nRow 2: [2,0,0]\n\nOutput:\n\nRow 0 and 1 same. Row 2 becomes [1,0,0].\n\nSo the changed cell is the 2 in row 2, column 0. What's different about that cell? Let's check the cells below it. There are no cells below. To the right is 0. Above is row 1, column 0, which is 0. So perhaps if a 2 has a 0 above it, it becomes 1? But in Example 1, row 3, column 1 (changed from 2 to 1), the cell above is row 2, column 1 which is 0. So that would fit.\n\nSo maybe the rule is: for each cell, if the cell is 2 and the cell directly above it is 0, then change it to 1. If there's no cell above (like top row), then it's considered as 0. So if top row's cell is 2 and above is nothing (treated as 0), then it's changed. But in Example 0, the top row's cells are 0,2,2. The 2s here are in the top row. So according to this rule, they would have above as 0 (non-existent), so the 2s would be changed to 1. But in the output, they remain 2. So this can't be the case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe check the cell below. For Example 0's changed cell (row 2, column 0), the cell below is nothing. So perhaps if a 2 has nothing below it (i.e., last row), then it's changed to 1. But in Example 1's changed cell (row 2, column 3), it's in the third row (assuming 0-based), and there is a row below (row 3). The cell below is 0. So maybe if a 2 has 0 below, it becomes 1.\n\nIn Example 0's changed cell (row 2, column 0), the cell below doesn't exist. So if we consider that as 0, then it would trigger the change. Let's test this.\n\nFor a cell (i,j), if cell (i+1,j) is 0 or out of bounds (treated as 0), then the cell (i,j) is 2, it becomes 1.\n\nIn Example 0:\n\nChanged cell is row 2, column 0. Row 3 doesn't exist, so cell below is 0. So 2 \u2192 1.\n\nIn Example 1's third row (row 2), column 3 (cell value 2). The cell below is row 3, column 3, which is 0. So 2 \u2192 1. Also, row 3, column 1 (original 2) has cell below (row 4, which doesn't exist) \u2192 treated as 0, so 2 \u2192 1. That matches the output.\n\nIn Example 3's input:\n\nSecond row (row 1), column 2 (value 2). The cell below is row 2, column 2 (value 0), so 2 \u2192 1. Third row, column 1 (value 2) has cell below (row 3, which is out of bounds \u2192 0), so 2 \u2192 1. That matches the output.\n\nAnother example: Example 2's third row (row 2), column 3 (value 2). The cell below is row 3, column 3, which is 0 (since row 3 is [0,0,0,0] in input). So 2 \u2192 1. Which matches the output.\n\nSo the pattern seems to be: For each cell, if the cell is 2 and the cell directly below it is 0 (or out of bounds, treated as 0), then change it to 1.\n\nLet's test this against the examples.\n\nExample 0:\n\nChanged cell (row 2, column 0): cell below is out of bounds \u2192 0. So 2 \u2192 1.\n\nOther 2s in row 0 and 1: cell below them. For row 0, column 1 (2): cell below is row 1, column 1 (2) \u2192 not 0, so no change. Similarly for row 0, column 2 (2): cell below is row 1, column 2 (2) \u2192 no change. So output rows 0 and 1 remain same. Correct.\n\nExample 1:\n\nChanged cells:\n\nRow 2, column 3 (2). Cell below (row 3, column 3) is 0 \u2192 1.\n\nRow 3, column 1 (2). Cell below (row 4, which doesn't exist) \u2192 0 \u2192 1.\n\nOther cells: row 0, column 0 (2) \u2192 cell below is row 1, column 0 (0). So 2 \u2192 1? But in the output, row 0, column 0 is still 2. Wait, that's a problem.\n\nWait in Example 1's input row 0 is [2,2,2,0]. Let's check each cell:\n\nRow 0, column 0: 2. Cell below is row 1, column 0 \u2192 0. So according to the rule, it should become 1, but in the output, it's still 2. This contradicts the rule.\n\nHmm, so this pattern doesn't hold for Example 1. Therefore, my hypothesis is incorrect.\n\nAlternative approach: Let's think differently. Maybe the rule is that a 2 is changed to 1 if there are exactly two 2s in its row and column. Or maybe if it's the only 2 in its row or column.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule is to change the last occurrence of 2 in each row to 1. Let's check:\n\nExample 0: Third row has [2,0,0]. The only 2 is the first element. Changed to 1. So no, because it's the first, not last.\n\nExample 1's third row is [0,0,0,2], which becomes [0,0,0,1] \u2192 last 2 becomes 1. Fourth row [0,2,0,0] \u2192 the 2 is in position 1. So the last 2 in the row (only one) becomes 1. That fits. Example 3's second row [2,0,2] \u2192 the last 2 becomes 1. Third row [0,2,0] \u2192 the only 2 becomes 1.\n\nExample 2's third row [2,2,0,2] \u2192 last 2 becomes 1. So in this case, the last 2 in each row is turned into 1. This seems to fit.\n\nLet's test this hypothesis against all examples.\n\nExample 0: Third row [2,0,0]. The only 2 is the first element. So according to this rule, the last 2 in the row is the first element (only one), so changed to 1. Which matches.\n\nExample 1:\n\nRow 0: [2,2,2,0]. The last 2 is in position 2. So it would become 1, but in the output, this row remains [2,2,2,0]. So this contradicts.\n\nSo this hypothesis is invalid.\n\nAnother idea: Maybe the rule is that if a 2 is followed by a 0 in the same row (next element), then it's replaced by 1. But in Example 1's first row [2,2,2,0], the third 2 (position 2) is followed by 0 (position 3). So according to this rule, it should become 1, but the output keeps it as 2. So that's a problem.\n\nWait, maybe the direction is not right, but left. Or maybe the previous element.\n\nAlternatively, if a 2 is preceded by a 0. But that doesn't fit either.\n\nAlternative approach: Look for the positions where 2s become 1s and see their coordinates.\n\nExample 0:\n\nChanged cell is (2,0).\n\nExample 1:\n\nChanged cells are (2,3), (3,1).\n\nExample 2:\n\nChanged cell is (2,3).\n\nExample 3:\n\nChanged cells are (1,2), (2,1).\n\nLooking for patterns in their positions. Let's see:\n\nIn Example 0: (2,0) is the first column of the last row.\n\nIn Example 1: (2,3) is last column of third row. (3,1) is second column of fourth row.\n\nExample 3: (1,2) is third column of second row. (2,1) is second column of third row.\n\nNot seeing a clear pattern in the positions. Maybe the number of 2s in the row or column?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 2s that are isolated. For example, in Example 0's (2,0) is the only 2 in that row. Example 1's (2,3) is the only 2 in that row. (3,1) is the only 2 in its row. Example 3's (1,2) is part of a row with two 2s. Hmm, this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 2s that are at the end of their line (like rightmost or leftmost in a row or column). For Example 0's (2,0) is the leftmost in its row and column. Example 1's (2,3) is the rightmost in its row, (3,1) is the only 2 in its row. Not sure.\n\nAlternative idea: Look for the number of 2s in each column. If a 2 is in a column where there's exactly one 2, then it becomes 1. Let's check.\n\nExample 0: Column 0 has two 0s and one 2. Changed cell is in column 0, row 2. So column 0 has three elements: [0,0,2]. So there's one 2. So the 2 becomes 1. But in column 1 of Example 0, there are three 2s (rows 0,1,2?), wait:\n\nNo. Example 0's input:\n\nRows:\n\nRow 0: [0,2,2]\n\nRow 1: [0,2,2]\n\nRow 2: [2,0,0]\n\nColumns:\n\nColumn 0: 0,0,2 \u2192 two 0s and one 2.\n\nColumn 1: 2,2,0 \u2192 two 2s and one 0.\n\nColumn 2: 2,2,0 \u2192 two 2s and one 0.\n\nSo the only column with exactly one 2 is column 0. The 2 in column 0 is changed to 1. That matches. \n\nExample 1's changed cells are (2,3) and (3,1). Let's check columns:\n\nFor (2,3): column 3. Input for column 3 is [0 (row 0), 0 (row 1), 2 (row 2), 0 (row 3)]. So column 3 has one 2. So it becomes 1.\n\nFor (3,1): column 1. Input column 1 has [2 (row 0), 2 (row 1), 0 (row 2), 2 (row 3)]. So three 2s. So this contradicts the previous idea, because the cell (3,1) is in a column with three 2s but still becomes 1. So the hypothesis is wrong.\n\nAnother approach: Let's think of the transformation as changing the 2s that are the only 2 in their respective row or column. \n\nExample 0's changed cell (row 2, column 0) is the only 2 in its row. Yes. So it becomes 1.\n\nExample 1's changed cell (row 2, column 3) is the only 2 in its row. Also, row 3, column 1 is the only 2 in its row. So both are changed to 1. That fits.\n\nExample 2's changed cell is row 2, column 3. The row has three 2s. Wait, input row 2 is [2,2,0,2]. So three 2s. So according to this idea, it wouldn't be changed, but in the output it becomes 1. So this contradicts.\n\nHmm. So this pattern doesn't hold.\n\nAlternative idea: Maybe the rule is to change the 2s that have exactly one adjacent 2 (either horizontally or vertically). Let's check.\n\nExample 0's changed cell (2,0): adjacent cells are right (0) and above (0). No adjacent 2s. So zero adjacent 2s. Changed to 1.\n\nExample 1's (2,3) cell: adjacent cells are left (0) and above (0). No adjacent 2s. So changed to 1.\n\nExample 1's (3,1) cell: adjacent cells are left (0), right (0), above (0). No adjacent 2s. So changed to 1.\n\nExample 3's (1,2) cell: adjacent cells are left (0), above (0 from row 0, column 2), right (nothing, considered 0), and below (row 2, column 2 is 0). So no adjacent 2s. So changed to 1.\n\nAnother cell in Example 3: (2,1) cell (originally 2). Adjacent cells: left (0), right (0), above (0 from row 1, column 1), and below (0). So no adjacent 2s. Changed to 1.\n\nSo perhaps the rule is: Any 2 that has no adjacent 2s (horizontally or vertically) is changed to 1.\n\nIn Example 0's (2,0) cell: no adjacent 2s. Changed.\n\nExample 1's (2,3): no adjacent 2s. Changed.\n\nExample 3's cells: no adjacent 2s. Changed.\n\nExample 2's (2,3) cell: in input, row 2 is [2,2,0,2]. The cell (2,3) is 2. Adjacent cells: left is 0, above (row 1, column 3 is 0), and below (row 3, column 3 is 0). So no adjacent 2s. So changed to 1. Which fits.\n\nNow, let's check the previous counterexample. Example 1's row 0, column 0: 2. Adjacent cells: right (2), below (0). So it has a right neighbor which is 2. So it has one adjacent 2. So according to the rule, it's not changed, which matches the output.\n\nAnother example: Example 1's row 0, column 1 is 2. Adjacent cells: left (2), right (2), below (2). So multiple adjacent 2s. Not changed. Which matches.\n\nExample 3's row 0, column 0 is 2. Adjacent cells: right (2), below (2). So has adjacent 2s. So not changed. Which matches.\n\nThis seems to fit all examples. So the rule is: Any 2 that has no adjacent 2s (horizontally or vertically) is changed to 1. Adjacency is up, down, left, right.\n\nTesting this rule with all examples:\n\nExample 0:\n\nOnly changed cell is (2,0). It has no adjacent 2s.\n\nExample 1:\n\nChanged cells (2,3) and (3,1) both have no adjacent 2s.\n\nExample 2:\n\nOnly changed cell is (2,3), which has no adjacent 2s.\n\nExample 3:\n\nChanged cells (1,2) and (2,1) both have no adjacent 2s.\n\nThis fits all examples.\n\nNow, apply this rule to the test input.\n\nTest Input:\n\nRow 0: [2,2,0,2]\n\nRow 1: [0,2,0,0]\n\nRow 2: [0,0,2,0]\n\nRow 3: [2,0,0,0]\n\nRow 4: [0,0,2,2]\n\nFor each cell, check if it's a 2 and has no adjacent 2s.\n\nLet's go through each cell:\n\nRow 0, columns 0-3:\n\n- (0,0): 2. Adjacent cells: right (0,1)=2, down (1,0)=0. So adjacent to 2. Not changed.\n\n- (0,1): 2. Adjacent to 2 (left), and (0,2)=0, (1,1)=2. So has adjacent 2s. Not changed.\n\n- (0,3): 2. Adjacent cells: left (0,2)=0, down (1,3)=0. No adjacent 2s. So this should become 1.\n\nRow 1:\n\n- (1,1): 2. Adjacent cells: up (0,1)=2, down (2,1)=0, left (1,0)=0, right (1,2)=0. So up is 2. So adjacent to 2. Not changed.\n\nRow 2:\n\n- (2,2): 2. Adjacent cells: up (1,2)=0, down (3,2)=0, left (2,1)=0, right (2,3)=0. So no adjacent 2s. Changed to 1.\n\nRow 3:\n\n- (3,0): 2. Adjacent cells: up (2,0)=0, down (4,0)=0, right (3,1)=0. So no adjacent 2s. Changed to 1.\n\nRow 4:\n\n- (4,2): 2. Adjacent cells: left (4,1)=0, right (4,3)=2, up (3,2)=0. So right is 2. So adjacent to 2. Not changed.\n\n- (4,3): 2. Adjacent cells: left (4,2)=2, up (3,3)=0. So adjacent to 2. Not changed.\n\nSo the cells to change are:\n\nRow 0, column 3 \u2192 1\n\nRow 2, column 2 \u2192 1\n\nRow 3, column 0 \u2192 1\n\nSo the output should be:\n\nRow 0: [2,2,0,1]\n\nRow 1: [0,2,0,0] (unchanged)\n\nRow 2: [0,0,1,0]\n\nRow 3: [1,0,0,0]\n\nRow 4: [0,0,2,2]\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\n[2,2,0,1]\n\n[0,2,0,0]\n\n[0,0,1,0]\n\n[1,0,0,0]\n\n[0,0,2,2]\n\nBut let's check if this matches the training examples' output format. The training examples have changes only to cells that meet the condition, and others remain the same. So the test input's output should reflect these changes."
