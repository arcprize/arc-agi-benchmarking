        "cot_1": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. So, we have these input grids where there's a single '2' somewhere, and the output grids have numbers like 3, 6, 7, 8, etc. The positions of these numbers in the output must be related to the position of the '2' in the input.\n\nLooking at Example 0: The input has a 2 in the middle of the second row (position [1][1] if we index from 0). The output has 3 and 6 in the first row, columns 0 and 2, and 8 and 7 in the third row, columns 0 and 2. Hmm, maybe the 2 is generating numbers around it? Like, maybe the numbers are placed in specific directions relative to the 2's position.\n\nExample 1: The input's 2 is at [2][4]. The output has a 3 in [1][3]. Wait, so maybe the numbers are shifted in some way. Let me note the positions. The original 2 is in the bottom right corner. The output's 3 is one row up and one column to the left. Then the other numbers might be 6,7,8 in other positions, but in this example, only 3 is present. Wait, the output for Example 1 is a 3 in the middle row, fourth column. Maybe the 3 is placed in a specific direction from the 2. Let's think about directions. Like, maybe 3 is to the left and up, 6 is right and up, 7 is right and down, 8 is left and down? Let's check.\n\nIn Example 0, the 2 is at (1,1). The 3 is at (0,0) which is up-left, 6 at (0,2) which is up-right. Then 8 is at (2,0) (down-left), and 7 at (2,2) (down-right). That fits. So 3 is up-left, 6 up-right, 8 down-left, 7 down-right. Then in Example 1, the 2 is at (2,4). So up-left would be (1,3), which is where the 3 is placed. But the output in Example 1's first row is all zeros except for the 3 in [1][3]. Then why aren't the other numbers present? Oh, maybe because those positions are out of bounds. For example, up-right from (2,4) would be (1,5), which is outside the grid. Similarly, down-right would be (3,5), which is invalid. So only the positions that are within the grid are filled. So in Example 1, the 2 is at the bottom right corner. Up-left is (1,3), which is valid. Up-right would be column 5 which doesn't exist. Down-left is (3,3), which is row 3 (invalid). Down-right is also invalid. So only 3 is placed. Wait, but in the output for Example 1, the output is a 3 in [1][3], and the rest are zeros. That makes sense.\n\nExample 2: Input has 2 at (0,2). So the positions would be up-left (invalid, since row -1), up-right (invalid, same row?), wait, maybe the direction is different. Wait, wait. Wait the 2 is in row 0, column 2. So up-left from here would be row -1, which is invalid. Up-right is row -1, column 3, invalid. Down-left would be row 1, column 1. Down-right is row 1, column 3. So those would be valid positions. So the output in Example 2 has 8 and 7 in the middle row, columns 1 and 3. So 8 is at [1][1], which is down-left from the 2, and 7 is at [1][3], down-right. So that matches. So the output for Example 2 has 8 and 7 in the middle row, which are the down-left and down-right positions from the original 2. Because the up positions are invalid.\n\nSimilarly, Example 3: Input has 2 at (1,3). The up-left would be (0,2), up-right (0,4), down-left (2,2), down-right (2,4). Then the output has 3 in [0][2], 6 in [0][4], 8 in [2][2], and 7 in [2][4]. Which matches exactly. So the pattern is that wherever the 2 is, the output places 3 in the cell diagonally up-left, 6 up-right, 8 down-left, and 7 down-right, provided those cells exist within the grid. If those positions are out of bounds, those numbers are not placed.\n\nNow, the test input is:\n\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 2]\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nSo the 2 is at position (1,4). Let's find the four directions:\n\nUp-left: (0,3) \u2192 row 0, column 3. Valid.\nUp-right: (0,5) \u2192 column 5 is invalid (since the grid has 0-4 columns).\nDown-left: (2,3) \u2192 row 2, column 3. Valid.\nDown-right: (2,5) \u2192 invalid.\n\nSo the numbers 3, 6, 8, 7 would be placed in the up-left, up-right (invalid), down-left, down-right (invalid) positions. So 3 is at (0,3), 8 at (2,3). What about 6 and 7? Since up-right and down-right are invalid, they are not placed. But wait, looking at the examples, when all four positions are valid (like example 0 and 3), all four numbers are placed. When only some are valid, the others are omitted.\n\nIn the test input, the 2 is at (1,4). So up-left is (0,3), down-left is (2,3). So in the output, those positions should get 3 and 8. Are there any other numbers? For example, 6 would be up-right (0,5) which is invalid. 7 would be down-right (2,5) invalid. So only 3 and 8. Let's check the training examples to see how they handle this. For instance, Example 1's 2 is at (2,4). The output has 3 at (1,3) and the rest zeros, which aligns with this logic.\n\nSo in the test case, the output should have 3 at (0,3) and 8 at (2,3). Let's see. The input's 2 is in the middle row, last column. Then up-left is (0,3) \u2192 3, down-left is (2,3) \u21928. The output should have these two numbers. Let's arrange them in the grid.\n\nThe output grid would be:\n\nFirst row: [0, 0, 0, 3, 0]\nSecond row: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\nThird row: [0, 0, 0, 8, 0]\n\nWait, but looking at Example 3, when the 2 was in (1,3), the output had 3 in (0,2), 6 in (0,4), 8 in (2,2), 7 in (2,4). So the numbers 3 and 6 are in the same row (row 0), columns to the left and right. Similarly, 8 and 7 are in row 2. So in the test case, perhaps 3 is in row 0, column 3 (up-left), but 6 would be in row 0, column 5 (invalid). So only 3 and 8. But in the output of Example 3, even if some positions are invalid, the numbers that are valid are placed, others omitted. So the test input's output would have 3 in row 0, column 3 and 8 in row 2, column 3. Then, the rest are zeros. Let me check the test input again.\n\nTest input:\n\n[0,0,0,0,0]\n[0,0,0,0,2]\n[0,0,0,0,0]\n\nSo the output should be:\n\nRow 0: [0, 0, 0, 3, 0] \u2192 3 at (0,3)\nRow 1: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\nRow 2: [0, 0, 0, 8, 0] \u2192 8 at (2,3)\n\nBut looking at the training examples, like Example 1, the output had the 3 in the row above the 2. But in Example 3, the numbers 3 and 6 are in the row above, 8 and 7 in the row below. So the test input's output would have 3 and 8. But wait, in Example 1, the 3 was in row 1 (the middle row), but the input's 2 was in row 2. Wait, let me recheck the examples.\n\nWait Example 1 input:\n\n[0,0,0,0,0]\n[0,0,0,0,0]\n[0,0,0,0,2]\n\nSo the 2 is at row 2, column 4. The output's 3 is in row 1, column 3. Which is up-left from the 2. So in that case, up-left is (2-1,4-1) = (1,3). So the test input's 2 is at (1,4). So up-left is (0,3), down-left is (2,3). So 3 at (0,3) and 8 at (2,3). So the output should be:\n\nRow 0: [0,0,0,3,0]\nRow 1: [0,0,0,0,0]\nRow 2: [0,0,0,8,0]\n\nBut wait the example 1's output has the 3 in row 1, column 3, and the rest zeros. So the output for the test input would have the 3 in row 0, column 3 and 8 in row 2, column 3. But looking at the other examples, like example 0 and 3, the numbers 3 and 6 are in the same upper row, 8 and 7 in the lower row. So perhaps in this test case, since up-right and down-right are invalid, only 3 and 8 are present.\n\nSo the output should be:\n\n[0, 0, 0, 3, 0]\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[0, 0, 0, 8, 0]\n\nBut wait in the training examples, the outputs sometimes have other numbers. For instance, Example 0's output has 3,6,8,7. Example 3 has 3,6,8,7. So when possible, all four numbers are placed. But in the test case, only two positions are valid. So only 3 and 8. But wait in Example 1, the 2 is at the bottom right, and only 3 is present. So the pattern is that each 2 generates 3,6,8,7 in their respective positions if within grid.\n\nSo test input's output should have 3 at (0,3) and 8 at (2,3). But let me check if in the training examples there's a case where two numbers are generated. Example 2's input has 2 at (0,2). So up-left is invalid, up-right invalid. Down-left and down-right are (1,1) and (1,3). So in Example 2's output, those positions have 8 and 7. So the output for example 2's middle row is [0,8,0,7,0], but according to the pattern, 8 is down-left (row 1, column 1) and 7 is down-right (row 1, column3). So in that case, two numbers are placed. So in the test case, we have two numbers. So the test output should have 3 in row0, column3 and 8 in row2, column3. The rest are zeros.\n\nSo putting it all together, the test output would be:\n\nRow0: [0,0,0,3,0]\n\nRow1: [0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow2: [0,0,0,8,0]\n\nBut let me check the format of the training examples. For example, Example 1's output is:\n\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n[0, 0, 0, 3, 0]\n\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nSo each row is in brackets. So for the test input, the output would be three rows. The first row has 3 in position 3, the third row has 8 in position 3. So the final output should look like:\n\n[0, 0, 0, 3, 0]\n\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n[0, 0, 0, 8, 0]\n\nYes, that seems correct. Let me double-check. The 2 is in position (1,4). Up-left is (0,3) \u2192 3. Down-left is (2,3) \u2192 8. The other directions (up-right and down-right) are out of bounds. So yes, this should be the correct answer.",

        "cot_2": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. So, the problem is about transforming a 3x5 grid input into an output grid. All the inputs have a single '2' somewhere, and the outputs have numbers like 3, 6, 7, 8, 0. Hmm. Let's look at each example one by one.\n\nStarting with Example 0:\nInput has a 2 in the second row, second position (assuming rows start at 0). The output has numbers in the first and third rows. Let's note their positions. The first row has 3 at position 0, 6 at position 2. The third row has 8 at position 0 and 7 at position 2. Wait, maybe the 2 in the input is being used to generate these numbers in specific positions relative to its location.\n\nExample 1:\nInput's 2 is in the third row, fifth position (index 4). The output has a 3 in the second row, position 3. So maybe the position of the 2 determines where the numbers are placed. For example, in the output, there are numbers around or in certain positions relative to the original 2.\n\nLooking at Example 2: The 2 is in the first row, third position (index 2). The output has 8 and 7 in the second row, positions 1 and 3. So 8 is to the left, 7 to the right. Similarly, in Example 3, the 2 is in the second row, index 3. The output has 3 and 6 in the first row, positions 2 and 4, and 8 and 7 in the third row, positions 2 and 4. Wait, maybe the numbers are placed in adjacent rows but shifted columns.\n\nAnother observation: The numbers in the output might be following a specific pattern. For instance, 3 and 6, 8 and 7. Let's see: 3+6=9, 8+7=15. Not sure. But perhaps they are fixed pairs. Like whenever there's a 2, the surrounding cells get these numbers in specific directions.\n\nLooking at all examples, the position of the 2 seems to determine where the numbers 3,6,7,8 are placed. Let's try to map each example.\n\nIn Example 0, the 2 is at (1,1). The output has 3 at (0,0), 6 at (0,2), 8 at (2,0), 7 at (2,2). So these are two rows above and below, and columns shifted left and right by one? Wait, original position is row 1, column 1. The 3 is row 0, column 0 (left), 6 is row 0, column 2 (right). Then 8 is row 2, column 0, and 7 is row 2, column 2. So the 3 and 6 are in the row above, left and right by one, and 8 and 7 in the row below, left and right by one. But the columns here are shifted by -1 and +1 from the original's column 1. So 1-1=0, 1+1=2. So for row above, same column shifts. Then in Example 1, the 2 is at (2,4). The output has 3 at (1,3). Wait, that's row 1 (above?), column 3, which is 4-1=3. So maybe in this case, since the original is at column 4, the left shift is 3 (4-1) but the right would be 5 which is out of bounds. So only the left shift is possible here, hence only 3 appears? But in Example 1's output, there's a 3 at (1,3), and the other positions maybe are zero. So maybe the numbers are placed in the row above and below, but if shifted columns are possible (within 0-4), otherwise not placed.\n\nExample 2: 2 is at (0,2). So in the row above would be non-existent (since it's the first row), so maybe the row below? Wait, in the output for Example 2, the 8 and 7 are in row 1 (middle row), columns 1 and 3. So original row 0, column 2. Then output is row 0+1=1, columns 2-1=1 and 2+1=3. So 8 and 7 in those positions. So in this case, since the original is in the top row, the numbers are placed in the same row's next row (row 1), shifted left and right. Then the other numbers (3,6) would be in row -1 which is invalid, so they are omitted.\n\nSimilarly, Example 3: 2 is at (1,3). The output has in row 0, columns 2 and 4 (3 and 6), and row 2, columns 2 and 4 (8 and7). So original column 3, shifted left by 1 (3-1=2) and right by 1 (3+1=4). So the upper row and lower row have these shifted columns.\n\nSo the pattern seems to be: wherever the 2 is located, in the output, the numbers 3 and 6 are placed in the row above (if possible) shifted left and right by 1, and 8 and 7 are placed in the row below (if possible) shifted left and right by 1. If the row is at the top (row 0), then there is no row above, so those numbers aren't placed. Similarly for the bottom row (row 2), no row below. But wait in Example 1, the 2 is at row 2 (third row), column 4. The output has 3 in row 1 (middle row), column 3. So maybe the logic is that for a 2 in row r, column c:\n\n- The row above (r-1) gets 3 at (c-1) and 6 at (c+1)\n- The row below (r+1) gets 8 at (c-1) and 7 at (c+1)\n\nBut if r-1 is out of bounds (like row 0), then those numbers are not placed. Similarly for r+1 beyond row 2.\n\nWait, in Example 0, original is row 1 (middle row). So above is row 0, which gets 3 and 6. Below is row 2, gets 8 and7. That matches.\n\nIn Example1, original is row 2 (last row). So the row below would be row3, which doesn't exist, so no 8 and7. The row above is row1. So 3 and6 would be at columns 3 (4-1) and5 (4+1). But column5 is out of bounds (since the grid is 0-4). So only column3 is valid. So in the output, row1, column3 has 3. 6 would be at column5, which is invalid, so no 6. But in the output, Example1's output has 3 in row1, column3. The other entries are zero. So that fits.\n\nIn Example2, original is row0 (first row). So row above doesn't exist, row below is row1. So 8 and7 would be in row1, columns1 and3 (since original column2). So 8 in column1,7 in column3. Which matches the output.\n\nExample3: original row1, column3. Row above (0) has 3 at column2 and6 at column4. Row below (2) has8 at column2 and7 at column4. Which matches the output.\n\nSo the pattern is:\n\nFor each occurrence of 2 in the input grid at position (r, c):\n\n- Place 3 in (r-1, c-1) if possible (row and column valid)\n- Place 6 in (r-1, c+1) if possible\n- Place8 in (r+1, c-1) if possible\n- Place7 in (r+1, c+1) if possible\n\nOther positions are zero.\n\nNow, applying this to the Test Input:\n\nTest Input is:\n\n[0,0,0,0,0]\n\n[0,0,0,0,2]\n\n[0,0,0,0,0]\n\nThe 2 is at row1 (middle row), column4 (last column). Let's see:\n\nr=1, c=4.\n\nRow above is row0. So:\n\n3 would be at (0,4-1)= (0,3)\n6 would be at (0,4+1)= (0,5) which is invalid (columns 0-4). So only 3 is placed at (0,3).\n\nRow below is row2:\n\n8 would be at (2,4-1)= (2,3)\n7 would be at (2,4+1)= (2,5) invalid. So only8 is placed at (2,3).\n\nSo the output should have:\n\nRow0: 0,0,0,3,0\n\nRow1: 0,0,0,0,0 (since the original row is row1, and the other positions are zero)\n\nRow2: 0,0,0,8,0\n\nWait, but in the training examples, when the 2 is in row2 (like Example1), the output placed 3 in row1, column3. Similarly, when in row1, the 3 and6 are in row0, and 8 and7 in row2.\n\nSo for the test input, since the 2 is in row1, column4:\n\nRow0: place 3 at column3 (c-1=3) and 6 at column5 (invalid). So only 3 at (0,3).\n\nRow2: place8 at column3 (c-1=3) and7 at column5 (invalid). So only8 at (2,3).\n\nBut looking at the training examples, the outputs sometimes have both numbers if possible. For instance, in Example3, the 2 was at column3 (which allows c+1=4, which is valid). So in that case, both 6 and3 were placed. Similarly, in Example0, which had 2 in column1, both shifts were possible.\n\nSo in the test case, since c=4, c-1=3 is valid, c+1=5 invalid. So row0 gets 3 at column3, and row2 gets8 at column3.\n\nTherefore, the output would be:\n\nRow0: [0,0,0,3,0]\n\nRow1: [0,0,0,0,0] (since the original 2 is here, but in the training examples the original row is set to all zeros except where the 2 was, but in the outputs, the original row is all zeros. Wait, in the training examples, the original 2's row becomes all zeros in the output. For example, in Example0, the original 2 was in row1, which in the output is all zeros. So the 2's row in the input is zeroed out in the output. So the numbers are only placed in the rows above and below, not in the same row. So in the test input, the original row1 becomes all zeros. So the output rows would be:\n\nRow0: [0,0,0,3,0]\n\nRow1: [0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow2: [0,0,0,8,0]\n\nBut let's check if any other numbers are present. Wait in Example3, the output has:\n\n[0,0,3,0,6] in row0,\n\nthen row1 is all zeros,\n\nrow2 has [0,0,8,0,7]\n\nSo for row0, 3 at c-1=2 (since original c=3) and 6 at c+1=4. So both are placed if possible.\n\nIn the test case, the original c=4. So row0 would have 3 at c-1=3, but no 6 since c+1=5 is invalid. So row0 has 3 at column3, row2 has8 at column3, and 7 is invalid. So the output would be:\n\nRow0: 0,0,0,3,0\n\nRow1: 0,0,0,0,0\n\nRow2: 0,0,0,8,0\n\nBut looking at the training examples, when only one number is placed in a row, like in Example1:\n\nOriginal 2 is in row2, column4. So row1 (r-1) has 3 in column3. row below (r+1) is invalid. So output has row1, column3:3. Other rows are zero.\n\nBut in the test case, the 2 is in row1, so row0 and row2 are affected. So the output would be as I mentioned.\n\nBut wait, let's check if there's any other pattern. For example, in Example0, the output has 3 and6 in row0, columns0 and2 (since original c=1). So 3 is c-1=0, 6 is c+1=2. Then row2 has8 and7 in columns0 and2. So in that case, both shifts are possible. In the test case, only the left shift is possible. So the output for row0 is [0,0,0,3,0], and row2 is [0,0,0,8,0].\n\nSo the final answer should be:\n\n[0,0,0,3,0]\n\n[0,0,0,0,0]\n\n[0,0,0,8,0]\n\nBut looking at the training examples, sometimes the numbers are 3,6,8,7. For example, in Example3, the output for row0 has 3 and6, and row2 has8 and7. So in cases where both shifts are possible, both numbers are added. Otherwise, only one.\n\nTherefore, applying this to the test input, the output should have 3 and6 in row0 if possible. But since c+1=5 is invalid, only 3 is present. Similarly for row2, only8 is present. So the answer would be as above."
