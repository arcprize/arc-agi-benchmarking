        "cot_1": "Okay, let's tackle this puzzle. The task is to figure out the pattern that transforms the input lists into the output lists provided in the training examples. Once I find the pattern, I need to apply it to the test input and generate the correct output.\n\nFirst, I'll start by looking at the training examples to see what's changing between the input and output. Let's go through each example one by one.\n\nStarting with Example 0:\n\nInput:\n[1, 8, 8, 7, 7, 8]\n[1, 1, 7, 7, 1, 8]\n[7, 1, 1, 7, 7, 8]\n\nOutput:\n[1, 8, 8, 5, 5, 8]\n[1, 1, 5, 5, 1, 8]\n[5, 1, 1, 5, 5, 8]\n\nLooking at the first input row: the numbers 7 and 7 are replaced with 5 and 5. Similarly, in the second row, the two 7s become 5s. The third row's first element changes from 7 to 5, and the subsequent 7s also turn into 5s. So it seems like 7s are being replaced with 5s under certain conditions.\n\nBut wait, not all 7s are changed. For example, in the third input row of Example 0, the first element is 7, which becomes 5, but the 8s remain. So maybe the replacement happens only when a 7 is adjacent to certain numbers or in a specific position.\n\nLooking at Example 1:\n\nInput:\n[7, 7, 7, 1]\n[1, 8, 1, 7]\n[7, 1, 1, 7]\n\nOutput:\n[5, 5, 5, 1]\n[1, 8, 1, 5]\n[5, 1, 1, 5]\n\nHere, all the 7s in the first row are replaced by 5s. In the third row, the first 7 becomes 5, and the last 7 also becomes 5. So again, 7s are turning into 5s. The 7 in the second row's last position also becomes 5. But in the first example's first input row, the two 7s in the middle are replaced, but the 8s remain. So maybe the rule is to replace every 7 with 5. But wait, looking back at Example 0's first input row: [1,8,8,7,7,8] becomes [1,8,8,5,5,8]. The 7s are replaced by 5s. Similarly, in Example 1, all 7s become 5s. But let's check Example 2.\n\nExample 2 Input:\n[1, 8, 1, 7, 1]\n[7, 8, 8, 1, 1]\n[7, 1, 8, 8, 7]\n\nOutput:\n[1, 8, 1, 5, 1]\n[5, 8, 8, 1, 1]\n[5, 1, 8, 8, 5]\n\nHere, the 7 in the first row becomes 5, the first and last elements of the third row (7s) become 5s. The second row's first element (7) becomes 5. So again, all 7s are replaced by 5s. Wait, but looking at Example 0's third input row: [7,1,1,7,7,8] becomes [5,1,1,5,5,8]. All the 7s are turned into 5s. So maybe the pattern is replacing every occurrence of 7 with 5. But that's a straightforward substitution, but let me check if there are any exceptions.\n\nWait in Example 1's input, the third row's last element is 7 which becomes 5. All 7s in inputs become 5s in outputs. Let me check if that's the case.\n\nBut let's cross-verify. Let's take Example 0's input:\n\nOriginal input rows:\n\nRow 1: [1, 8, 8, 7, 7, 8] \u2192 Output becomes [1,8,8,5,5,8]. The 7s become 5s.\n\nRow 2: [1,1,7,7,1,8] \u2192 [1,1,5,5,1,8]. Again, 7s to 5s.\n\nRow 3: [7,1,1,7,7,8] \u2192 [5,1,1,5,5,8]. All 7s replaced.\n\nIn Example 1:\n\nInput rows:\n\nRow 1: [7,7,7,1] \u2192 [5,5,5,1]. All 7s become 5s.\n\nRow 2: [1,8,1,7] \u2192 [1,8,1,5]. The last 7 becomes 5.\n\nRow3: [7,1,1,7] \u2192 [5,1,1,5]. Both 7s become 5s.\n\nIn Example 2:\n\nInput rows:\n\nRow1: [1,8,1,7,1] \u2192 [1,8,1,5,1]. The 7 becomes 5.\n\nRow2: [7,8,8,1,1] \u2192 [5,8,8,1,1]. First 7 becomes 5.\n\nRow3: [7,1,8,8,7] \u2192 [5,1,8,8,5]. Both 7s become 5s.\n\nSo the pattern seems to be replacing all 7s with 5s. So the transformation is simply changing every 7 to a 5. Is that the case?\n\nBut let's check the test input. Let's see the test input:\n\nTest Input:\n[1,7,7,1,7]\n[8,1,7,7,7]\n[8,7,1,7,8]\n\nIf the rule is to replace all 7s with 5s, then the output would be:\n\n[1,5,5,1,5]\n[8,1,5,5,5]\n[8,5,1,5,8]\n\nBut let's check if that aligns with the training examples. All 7s in the input become 5s in the output. So the answer should be the test input with all 7s replaced by 5s.\n\nWait, but let's confirm again. Are there any exceptions where a 7 isn't replaced? Let's look at the training examples again. In all examples, every occurrence of 7 in the input is replaced by 5 in the output. There's no case where a 7 remains. So yes, the pattern is simply replacing all 7s with 5s.\n\nSo applying that to the test input, each 7 becomes 5. Let's do that.\n\nTest input rows:\n\nFirst row: [1,7,7,1,7] \u2192 [1,5,5,1,5]\n\nSecond row: [8,1,7,7,7] \u2192 [8,1,5,5,5]\n\nThird row: [8,7,1,7,8] \u2192 [8,5,1,5,8]\n\nSo the output should be three lists with 7s replaced by 5s.\n\nBut let me check if there's any other pattern. For example, maybe 7s are replaced with 5s only if they are adjacent to certain numbers. But in Example 0's first input row, the 7s are next to 8 and each other. They are replaced. In Example 1's first row, three consecutive 7s are all replaced. In the third example, the 7s are adjacent to 1s and 8s, but they are still replaced. So no, it's not dependent on neighbors. It's a straightforward substitution.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be replacing all 7s with 5s in the test input.",

        "cot_2": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. So, looking at the training examples, each input is a list of lists (like a matrix), and the output seems to modify some of the numbers. Let me go through each example step by step.\n\nStarting with Example 0. The input is three rows with numbers like 1,8,8,7,7,8 and similar. The output changes some of those 7s to 5s. Let me check which ones. For instance, in the first row of input: [1,8,8,7,7,8] becomes [1,8,8,5,5,8]. So the two 7s in the middle are replaced by 5s. The next row [1,1,7,7,1,8] becomes [1,1,5,5,1,8]\u2014again, the 7s turn into 5s. Third row [7,1,1,7,7,8] becomes [5,1,1,5,5,8]. So the 7s here are also replaced by 5s. But wait, not all 7s are replaced. Let me see. In the first row of input, the 7s are at positions 3 and 4 (0-based index 3 and 4). The output replaces both. But in the third row, the first element is 7, and becomes 5. The fourth and fifth elements (originally 7 and 7) become 5 and 5. So maybe it's replacing all 7s except when they are adjacent to 8s? Or perhaps there's another condition.\n\nWait, let's check Example 1. Input is [7,7,7,1] becomes [5,5,5,1]. So all the leading 7s are replaced. The next row [1,8,1,7] becomes [1,8,1,5]. The last 7 becomes 5. Third row [7,1,1,7] becomes [5,1,1,5]. So again, the 7s at the ends are replaced. So maybe all 7s are replaced by 5s unless they are adjacent to an 8? Let me check that.\n\nLooking back at Example 0's first row: [1,8,8,7,7,8]. The 7s here are between 8 and 8. Wait, the numbers before the 7s are 8 and 8 (since the first three elements are 1,8,8, then 7,7,8). So the 7s are between 8s. But in that case, the output replaces them. Hmm. Maybe the rule is different. Let's see.\n\nWait, maybe it's about the 7s that are not followed by an 8. Or perhaps any 7 that is not immediately next to an 8 is replaced. Let's take Example 0's third row input: [7,1,1,7,7,8]. The first 7 is followed by 1, so it's replaced. The fourth and fifth 7s are followed by 7 and then 8. So the fourth 7 (index 3) is followed by 7, and the fifth 7 (index4) is followed by 8. So the 7 at index4 is adjacent to 8. But in the output, both are replaced by 5. Hmm, so that might not be the case.\n\nAnother approach: Let's see if the 7s that are part of a consecutive group are being replaced. Like, any sequence of 7s that is not adjacent to 8? Or maybe the direction matters. Let me check Example 2.\n\nIn Example 2's input: The first row is [1,8,1,7,1], output [1,8,1,5,1]. So the 7 is replaced by 5. The second input row is [7,8,8,1,1] which becomes [5,8,8,1,1]. The first 7 is replaced by 5. The third row input [7,1,8,8,7] becomes [5,1,8,8,5]. Both the first and last 7s are replaced. So in all these cases, 7s are replaced with 5s, except when they are adjacent to 8? Wait, in the second example, the 7 is followed by 8. So the first element is 7, next is 8. So that 7 is adjacent to 8, but it's still replaced by 5. Hmm, that contradicts that idea.\n\nWait, maybe it's the opposite. Maybe 7s that are adjacent to 1s are replaced. Let's look. In Example 0's first input row: the 7s are between 8,8 and 8. Wait, no, the row is [1,8,8,7,7,8]. So the 7s are between 8 and 8. So in that case, they are adjacent to 8s. But they are replaced. So that doesn't fit. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe all 7s are replaced by 5s unless they are next to a 1. Wait, looking at Example 1's third row input [7,1,1,7] becomes [5,1,1,5]. The 7s are next to 1s (the first 7 is next to 1, and the last 7 is next to 1). So according to that, they would be replaced, which they are. So that's not the condition.\n\nAlternatively, maybe every 7 that is not part of a pair with an 8. Or perhaps the rule is that 7s are replaced by 5s except when they are adjacent to an 8 on either side. Let me check.\n\nIn Example 0's first input row: [1,8,8,7,7,8]. The 7s are at positions 3 and 4. The element before them is 8 (position 2 is 8), and the element after is 8 (position5). So the 7s are between 8 and 8. But they are replaced by 5s. So that's not it.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is that any 7 that is not immediately followed by an 8 is replaced by 5. Let's test that.\n\nIn Example 0's first row, the 7s are followed by 7 and then 8. So the first 7 (position3) is followed by 7 (position4), which is not 8, so it's replaced. The second 7 (position4) is followed by 8 (position5). So according to this rule, the first 7 would be replaced, but the second 7 is followed by 8, so not replaced. But in the output, both are replaced. So that's not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe any 7 that is not preceded by an 8 is replaced. Let's see. For Example 0's first row, the 7s are at positions 3 and4. The previous element is 8 (position2 is 8). So if the rule is that 7s not preceded by 8 are replaced, then these would not be replaced. But in the output, they are. So that doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. Let's look for a different pattern. All the 8s remain the same in the outputs. So 8s are untouched. The 1s are also left as they are, except in Example 2's second row where the first element was 7 and became 5. Wait, but 1s are not changed. Let me check all examples.\n\nIn Example0's input, all 1s in the input are present in the output. Same for Example1. So 1s and 8s are unchanged, but 7s are sometimes replaced by 5s. So the main change is replacing certain 7s with 5s. The question is, under what conditions?\n\nLooking at the outputs, perhaps all 7s that are not directly followed by an 8 are replaced. Let me check again.\n\nIn Example0's first input row: [1,8,8,7,7,8]. The 7s are followed by 7 and 8. The first 7 (position3) is followed by 7 (so not 8), so replaced. The second 7 (position4) is followed by 8. So according to that, the first is replaced, the second is not. But in the output, both are replaced. So that's not correct.\n\nAlternative approach: Maybe any 7 that is either the first or last element in a row is replaced. Let's check. In Example0's third row input: [7,1,1,7,7,8]. The first element is 7 (replaced), and the last element is 8. The fourth and fifth elements are 7 and7, which are replaced. So that doesn't fit. Or perhaps the 7s that are not adjacent to an 8 on either side.\n\nIn Example0's first row, the 7s are between 8 and 8 (since the elements before are 8,8 and after is 8). So they are surrounded by 8s. But they are replaced. So that's not the condition.\n\nAnother idea: Maybe all 7s are replaced by 5s except when they are next to an 8. Wait, but in Example0's first row, the 7s are next to 8 (the element before is 8, the element after is 8), but they are replaced. So that contradicts.\n\nWait, maybe the direction matters. For example, replace 7s that are not followed by an 8. Let's check. In Example0's first input row, the first 7 is at position3. The next element is 7 (position4). So not followed by 8. So replaced. The second 7 is at position4, followed by 8. So not replaced. But in the output, both are replaced. So that's not matching.\n\nHmm, maybe the replacement is done for all 7s except those that are followed by an 8. Wait, in that case, Example0's first row would replace the first 7 (since next is 7), but not the second 7 (next is 8). But the output replaces both. So that's conflicting.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule is to replace all 7s except when they are preceded by an 8. Let's check. For Example0's first row, the 7s are preceded by 8. So they would not be replaced. But in the output, they are. So that's not it.\n\nAnother angle: maybe the replacement is based on the row's position. But the examples have varying row counts, so probably not.\n\nWait, looking at the test input:\n\nTest Input:\n\n[1,7,7,1,7]\n[8,1,7,7,7]\n[8,7,1,7,8]\n\nThe output should be replacing some 7s with 5s. Let's think what the pattern would require.\n\nIf in the training examples, all 7s are replaced by 5s except those that are adjacent (either before or after) to 8s. Let me test this hypothesis.\n\nTake Example0's first input row: [1,8,8,7,7,8]. The 7s are at positions3 and4. The elements before them are 8 (position2), and after is 8 (position5). So they are surrounded by 8s. But in output, both are replaced. So that's conflicting.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps only the 7s that are not adjacent to any 8s. For instance, in Example1's first row input [7,7,7,1], there are no 8s. So all 7s are replaced. The output is [5,5,5,1]. That fits. In Example1's second row [1,8,1,7], the 7 is adjacent to 1 (no 8). So replaced. The output's last element is 5, correct. Third row [7,1,1,7] has 7s adjacent to 1 and 7. Replaced. So in this case, perhaps any 7 that is not adjacent (before or after) to an 8 is replaced by 5.\n\nLet's check this with Example0. In the first row: [1,8,8,7,7,8]. The first 7 is at position3. The element before is 8, so adjacent to 8. So according to this rule, it would not be replaced. But in the output, it is replaced. So that's a problem.\n\nWait, maybe the rule is that 7s are replaced by 5s except when they are immediately followed by an 8. Let's check that.\n\nExample0's first row, the first 7 (position3) is followed by 7 (position4), then 8 (position5). So the first 7 is followed by 7, so it is replaced. The second 7 (position4) is followed by 8. So according to the rule, it is not replaced. But in the output, both are replaced. So that's not matching.\n\nAlternatively, the rule could be that 7s are replaced by 5s if they are not immediately followed by an 8. So, if the next element is not an 8, replace. Let's see.\n\nIn Example0's first row, the first 7 (position3) is followed by 7 (position4), which is not 8. So replaced. The second 7 (position4) is followed by 8. So not replaced. But the output replaces both. So this doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. Let's look for another pattern. What if the 7s that are part of a group (consecutive 7s) are replaced by 5s, except when they are adjacent to 8. Let's see.\n\nIn Example0's first row, the two 7s are consecutive. They are between 8 and 8. So they are adjacent to 8s. But they are replaced. So that's not matching.\n\nIn Example1's first row, all 7s are consecutive and not adjacent to 8s. So they are replaced.\n\nIn Example2's third row input: [7,1,8,8,7]. The first 7 is adjacent to 1 (no 8), so replaced. The last 7 is adjacent to 8. So according to this, the last 7 would not be replaced. But the output replaces both. So again, not matching.\n\nThis is getting confusing. Let's think differently. Maybe the 7s are replaced by 5s when they are not part of a sequence that includes an 8. Or perhaps it's a diagonal consideration. Wait, maybe the replacement is done for 7s that are in the same row and column as a 1. But that's more complex.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is that every 7 in the input is replaced by 5, except those that are adjacent (left, right, up, down) to an 8. Let's consider that. Let's check Example0's first row. The 7s are in row0, positions3 and4. Let's look at their adjacent cells. For position3 (row0, column3), the left is 8 (row0, column2), right is 7 (row0, column4), and below (row1, column3) is 7. So adjacent cells include 8 (left) and 7 (right). So according to the rule, since one adjacent cell is 8, this 7 would not be replaced. But in the output, it's replaced. So this hypothesis is invalid.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 7s are replaced by 5s unless they are directly next to an 8 in the same row. Let's check.\n\nExample0's first row: 7s are next to 8 (left) and 7 (right). So there is an 8 adjacent (left). So according to this rule, they should not be replaced, but they are. So again, not matching.\n\nThis is tricky. Let's try to look for a numerical pattern. What if 7s are replaced by 5s, but only when the sum of their neighbors (left and right) is not equal to a certain value. Or perhaps when the 7 is between two 8s, but that doesn't fit.\n\nWait, looking at Example0's input and output:\n\nOriginal 7s become 5s. So 7 ->5. What's special about 5? Maybe 5 is 7 minus 2, but that's a stretch.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 7s are replaced by 5s when they are in certain positions. Let's check the positions where 7s are replaced.\n\nIn Example0's first row: positions3 and4 (0-based) are replaced. The first row's input is [1,8,8,7,7,8], so elements 3 and4 are 7s, replaced by5. The other elements are 1,8,8,8. So 7s in the middle are replaced. Hmm.\n\nIn Example1's first row: [7,7,7,1] becomes [5,5,5,1]. All 7s are replaced.\n\nExample1's second row: [1,8,1,7] becomes [1,8,1,5]. The last 7 is replaced.\n\nThird row: [7,1,1,7] becomes [5,1,1,5]. All 7s replaced.\n\nExample2's first row: [1,8,1,7,1] becomes [1,8,1,5,1]. The 7 is replaced.\n\nSecond row input: [7,8,8,1,1] becomes [5,8,8,1,1]. The first 7 is replaced.\n\nThird row: [7,1,8,8,7] becomes [5,1,8,8,5]. Both 7s are replaced.\n\nSo from all examples, it seems that all 7s in the input are replaced by 5s in the output. Wait, that can't be. Because in Example0's first input row, the last element is 8, so 7s are replaced. But wait, maybe all 7s are replaced by 5s, regardless of their neighbors. Let me check the examples again.\n\nWait, in Example0's input:\n\nFirst row input: [1,8,8,7,7,8] \u2192 output [1,8,8,5,5,8]. All 7s replaced.\n\nSecond row input: [1,1,7,7,1,8] \u2192 [1,1,5,5,1,8]. All 7s replaced.\n\nThird row input: [7,1,1,7,7,8] \u2192 [5,1,1,5,5,8]. All 7s replaced.\n\nExample1's inputs:\n\nFirst row: [7,7,7,1] \u2192 [5,5,5,1]. All 7s replaced.\n\nSecond row: [1,8,1,7] \u2192 [1,8,1,5]. The 7 is replaced.\n\nThird row: [7,1,1,7] \u2192 [5,1,1,5]. All 7s replaced.\n\nExample2's inputs:\n\nFirst row: [1,8,1,7,1] \u2192 [1,8,1,5,1]. 7 replaced.\n\nSecond row: [7,8,8,1,1] \u2192 [5,8,8,1,1]. 7 replaced.\n\nThird row: [7,1,8,8,7] \u2192 [5,1,8,8,5]. 7s replaced.\n\nSo in all training examples, every occurrence of 7 is replaced by 5. But that's not possible because in the test input, for example, there's a 7 that might be next to an 8. But according to the training examples, all 7s are replaced by 5s. Let me check if that's true.\n\nWait, let me check Example1's second row input: [1,8,1,7]. The 7 is the last element, replaced by5. No exceptions. So perhaps the rule is simply replace all 7s with 5s, and leave other numbers as is.\n\nBut wait, in Example0's first row input, there are 7s that are between 8s and they are replaced, which would align with that. So the pattern is simply replacing every 7 with 5.\n\nIf that's the case, then the test input's 7s would all become 5s.\n\nBut let's look at the test input:\n\nTest Input:\n\nRow1: [1,7,7,1,7] \u2192 should become [1,5,5,1,5]\n\nRow2: [8,1,7,7,7] \u2192 [8,1,5,5,5]\n\nRow3: [8,7,1,7,8] \u2192 [8,5,1,5,8]\n\nSo the output would be:\n\n[1,5,5,1,5]\n[8,1,5,5,5]\n[8,5,1,5,8]\n\nBut let me check the training examples again. Are all 7s replaced? Let me confirm.\n\nIn Example2's input row2: [7,8,8,1,1] becomes [5,8,8,1,1]. The first 7 is replaced. All other 7s in the inputs are replaced. So yes, every 7 becomes a 5.\n\nSo the pattern is simply replace every occurrence of 7 with 5. All other numbers stay the same.\n\nThat's the simplest explanation and fits all the training examples. So why did I overcomplicate it before? Maybe because the examples have 7s in different contexts, but they all get replaced.\n\nTherefore, applying this to the test input, all 7s are replaced with 5s. Let's do that.\n\nOriginal Test Input:\n\nRow1: [1,7,7,1,7] \u2192 [1,5,5,1,5]\n\nRow2: [8,1,7,7,7] \u2192 [8,1,5,5,5]\n\nRow3: [8,7,1,7,8] \u2192 [8,5,1,5,8]\n\nYes. So the output would be three rows as above."
