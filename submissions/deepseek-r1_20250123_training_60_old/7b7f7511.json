        "cot_1": "Okay, let's look at the training examples to find the pattern.\n\nStarting with Example 0. The input has four lists each with 8 elements, and the output is the same four lists but each halved to 4 elements. For instance, the first input list [1,1,3,2,1,1,3,2] becomes [1,1,3,2]. So they took the first half of each list.\n\nExample 1 shows similar behavior. The input lists have 6 elements each, and the outputs are the first 3 elements. Like [4,4,4,4,4,4] becomes [4,4,4]. Again, taking the first half of the list.\n\nExample 2 has input lists of length 2 each. The output is the same as the input, but since there are six lists in the input and three in the output, it looks like duplicates are removed. Wait, the input has three unique lists repeated twice. The output lists them once each. So maybe the pattern is to take the first half of each list and remove duplicate lists, but wait, in example 0 and 1, the outputs are the same number of lists as input, just each list is halved. Wait no, in example 0, the input has 4 lists, output also 4. Each list is halved. Example 1 input has 3 lists, output 3. Each list is halved. Example 2 input has 6 lists, but output 3. So that's different. Wait, the input in Example 2 is six lists, each of two elements. The output is three lists. Looking at the input, it's [2,3], [3,2], [4,4], then repeats the same three again. So the output is the three unique lists. So here, the pattern might be to take the first half of each list (since length 2, half is 1 element? But that doesn't make sense. Wait, perhaps the pattern is different here.\n\nWait, maybe the pattern is that for each list in the input, they take the first half, and then deduplicate the resulting lists. But in Example 0 and 1, there are no duplicates after halving. Let's check. Example 0's input lists after halving become the output lists. The output lists are all unique. So no need to deduplicate. In example 1, same thing. But in example 2, after halving each list (since each input list is length 2, taking first half would be first 1 element?), but that's not matching the output. Wait, in example 2, the output lists are the same as the input. Wait, the input lists are [2,3], [3,2], [4,4], repeated twice. The output is the three unique lists. So the pattern here might be that when the list is duplicated, you remove the duplicates. So perhaps the pattern is: for each list in the input, take the first half of the elements, then from the resulting lists, remove any duplicates that appear consecutively or overall?\n\nWait, but in Example 2, the input has 6 lists. The output is the same as the first three lists. So maybe the first half of the total number of lists. Like, if there are N lists, take the first N/2 lists. But in example 0, input has 4 lists, output 4. So that's not matching. Example 1 input has 3 lists, output 3. So that wouldn't fit either. So that can't be.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the input is structured in a grid, and the output is taking the first half of each row (the lists) and then the first half of the rows. Wait, let's see. Example 0: input has 4 lists. Output is the same 4 lists but each halved. So number of rows remains same, each row is halved. Example 1: input 3 lists, output 3. Each row halved. Example 2: input 6 lists, output 3. So in this case, perhaps the rows are being halved (each list length is halved) and the number of rows is also halved. But in example 2, each list's length is 2, halving gives 1, but output lists are length 2. So that doesn't fit. Hmm.\n\nWait in Example 2, the output is the same as the input's first three lists. The input is six lists which are three unique lists repeated twice. So maybe when there are duplicate lists in the input, they are removed. But how? The output in Example 2 is the three unique lists. But how are they ordered? They appear in the same order as their first occurrence. So the pattern here is to take the first half of each list (but in Example 2, the lists are length 2, so first half is 1 element? But the output lists are still length 2. So that can't be. So perhaps the first part is to take the entire list, but then deduplicate. But why in Example 2, the output is three lists, same as the first half of the input lists (since the input has six lists, and the first three are the same as the next three, so taking first three and removing duplicates? Wait no, in the input of Example 2, the first three are [2,3], [3,2], [4,4], then the same three again. So output is the three unique lists, but in the same order as their first occurrence. So perhaps the pattern is to deduplicate the lists, keeping only the first occurrence, and each list is kept as is. But that doesn't fit the previous examples. Because in Example 0 and 1, all the lists are unique after halving, so they remain the same number. But in Example 2, after halving (if each list is split), but the output lists are the same as input. So maybe the first part is that each list is kept as is, but the entire input is being split into groups and then deduplicated. Alternatively, maybe the input is a 2D array where each row is a list, and the transformation is to split each row into two halves, keep the first half, then deduplicate the rows. Let's check:\n\nExample 0:\n\nInput lists have 8 elements each. Split into two halves, each of 4 elements. The output is the first half. So each row is reduced to first half. The output lists are the same as the first halves. No deduplication needed here as all are unique.\n\nExample 1: input lists have 6 elements. Split into two halves of 3. Output is first halves. Again, no duplicates.\n\nExample 2: input lists have 2 elements each. Split into two halves of 1 element. But the output lists are length 2, same as input. So this contradicts.\n\nWait, maybe the pattern is different. Let me re-express each example.\n\nIn Example 0, input lists are of length 8. Output is first four elements. So each list is halved.\n\nIn Example 1, input lists are of length 6. Output is first three elements. Halving again.\n\nIn Example 2, input lists are of length 2. Output is the same as the input. But why? Because halving would give 1 element, but output is 2 elements. So perhaps the pattern isn't halving. Alternatively, maybe the pattern is to take the first half of the entire array. Wait, looking at the Test Input: the input lists are each 3 elements. So if we take the first half, which would be 1.5 elements, but since we can't have half elements, perhaps take the first two elements? But in the Test Input, each list is of length 3. So first half (rounded up or down). For 3 elements, half is 1.5, so perhaps take 2 elements. Let's see what the expected output would be. The Test Input has 8 lists, each with 3 elements. If the pattern is to take the first half of each list (rounded up or down). For 3 elements, half is 1.5, so maybe 2 elements. Then the output for each list would be the first two elements. For example, the first list [5,4,5] becomes [5,4]. Then, perhaps after processing each list, we need to deduplicate. But in the training examples, sometimes deduplication occurs (Example 2) and sometimes not (Examples 0 and 1). So perhaps the pattern is:\n\n- For each list in the input, take the first half of its elements (if even length, exactly half; if odd, maybe round down or up? In Example 2, original lists are length 2, so first half is 1, but the output lists are 2 elements. So maybe rounding isn't the case here. Alternatively, maybe the lists are split into two equal parts, possibly by doubling? Not sure.\n\nWait, Example 2's input lists are [2,3], [3,2], [4,4], then repeated. The output is the three unique lists. But how are they transformed? The output lists are the same as the input. So perhaps the pattern here is that when the lists are of even length, split into two equal parts and take the first part, but when the length is even but the split would result in a single element (like in Example 2, length 2 split into two parts of 1 each), but the output is the same as the first part. Wait, but in Example 2's output, the lists are of length 2, which contradicts this idea.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is to take the first half of the entire input array. Wait, let's look at the inputs as a whole. For Example 0, there are 4 lists. Output is 4 lists, each with half the elements. So number of lists remains the same. For Example 1, 3 input lists, 3 output. For Example 2, 6 input lists, 3 output. So that's half the number of lists. So maybe the pattern is: for each list, take the first half of its elements, and then take the first half of the number of lists. But how does that fit?\n\nExample 0: 4 lists \u2192 4 lists (no reduction), but each list is halved. So taking first half of the lists would be 2, but output is 4. So that's not matching.\n\nAlternatively, the pattern could be that the input is a 2D array where each row is a list, and the output is the first half of each row and the first half of the rows. But this doesn't fit. For example, in Example 0, input is 4 rows, output 4 rows (no row reduction), but each row is halved. So row count remains same, column count per row is halved.\n\nBut in Example 2, the input has 6 rows. The output has 3 rows, which is half. So rows are halved, and each row is halved. Wait, but in Example 2, each input row has 2 elements. Halved would be 1, but output rows have 2 elements. So that doesn't fit. So this approach isn't correct.\n\nLet me re-express the examples again.\n\nLooking at Example 0: input lists are length 8. Output lists are length 4. So each list is halved. Then, the output is the same as the input lists with their first halves.\n\nExample 1: input lists are length 6. Output lists are length 3. Halved.\n\nExample 2: input lists are length 2. Output lists are length 2. So no change in length here. But the number of lists is halved. So in this case, each list is kept the same, but the total number of lists is halved. But why? Because the input lists are duplicated. So in Example 2, the first three lists are unique, and the next three are duplicates. So the output is the first three, thus removing duplicates. So the pattern here is: for each list in the input, take the first half of its elements (but if the length is even, halve; but for length 2, take 1 element? But in Example 2's output, the lists are length 2. So that can't be right. So maybe the transformation is not about the elements in the list but the lists themselves.\n\nAlternative approach: The pattern is to remove duplicate lists from the input. But in Example 0 and 1, there are no duplicate lists. So output remains same. In Example 2, the input has duplicate lists (each repeated twice), so output is the unique ones. But this doesn't fit with Example 0 and 1, where output lists are shorter. Wait, the output lists in Example 0 and 1 are shorter than the input lists. So this can't be.\n\nWait, maybe the pattern is two-fold:\n\n1. For each list in the input, take the first half of the elements. \n\n2. Then, from the resulting lists, remove duplicates, keeping the first occurrence.\n\nBut in Example 0 and 1, after halving the lists, there are no duplicates. So the output is the same as the first step. In Example 2, after halving each list (each of length 2 \u2192 first 1 element), but the output lists are length 2, which doesn't align. So this theory is invalid.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the first step is to take the entire list (no change), then remove duplicate lists. For example, in Example 2, the input has six lists, but three are duplicates, so output is three unique ones. But in Example 0 and 1, the input lists are unique, so output is same as input. But in Example 0, the input lists are:\n\n[1,1,3,2,1,1,3,2]\n\n[1,1,3,3,1,1,3,3]\n\n[3,3,1,1,3,3,1,1]\n\n[2,3,1,1,2,3,1,1]\n\nOutput is the first four elements of each list. So if the input lists were unique, then after taking first half, the output lists are unique. But Example 0's output is the first half of each input list.\n\nWait, this seems to be the key. Each list in the input is transformed by taking the first half of its elements. So:\n\n- For a list of even length, take the first half. E.g., length 8 \u2192 4 elements.\n\n- For a list of even length 6 \u2192 3 elements.\n\n- For a list of even length 2 \u2192 1 element? But in Example 2, the output lists are length 2. So that's conflicting. So perhaps this is not the correct pattern.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is to split each list into two equal parts and take the first part, but if the list length is odd, how to handle it? The Test Input has lists of length 3, which would split into 1 and 2 elements. Taking first part (1 element) or first two (if rounded up).\n\nBut in Example 2, the input lists are length 2. Split into two parts of 1 element each. Take the first part, which would be [2], [3], [4], but the output lists are length 2. So this doesn't make sense.\n\nWait, maybe the pattern is different. Let's look for another pattern.\n\nIn Example 0, each input list has a repeating pattern. For example, the first input list is [1,1,3,2,1,1,3,2]. The output is [1,1,3,2], which is the first four elements, and the next four elements are [1,1,3,2], which is the same as the first four. So perhaps the list is composed of two identical halves, and the output is one of the halves. So the pattern here is to take the first half of each list, assuming that the list is composed of two identical parts. But in Example 0's first input list, the first half is [1,1,3,2], and the second half is [1,1,3,2], so same. So output is first half. Same for other lists in example 0. \n\nIn Example 1, the first input list is [4,4,4,4,4,4]. Split into two halves: [4,4,4] and [4,4,4]. So output is the first half. The second list is [6,4,8,6,4,8]. Split into [6,4,8] and [6,4,8], so same as first half. Third list [6,6,8,6,6,8] splits into [6,6,8] and [6,6,8]. So output is the first halves. So here, each list is made of two identical halves, and the output is the first half.\n\nIn Example 2, the input lists are [2,3], [3,2], [4,4], each repeated twice. So each list is duplicated. The output is the first three lists, which are the unique ones. But the lists themselves are not composed of identical halves. For example, [2,3] has first half [2], second [3]. Not the same. So why is the output the same as the input lists? Because here, the entire list is considered as a single element, and the transformation is to take each unique list once. But how does that fit with previous examples? \n\nSo maybe the pattern is: if each list in the input is composed of two identical halves, then output the first half. Otherwise, if the lists are duplicated in the input (like appearing multiple times), output each unique list once. But how to determine when to apply which rule?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is to take the first half of each list, but if the entire list is made up of two identical halves, then output the first half. Otherwise, keep the entire list.\n\nBut in Example 2, the input lists are not made up of identical halves. For example, [2,3] has halves [2] and [3], which are different. So according to this rule, the output should keep the entire list. But in Example 2's output, the lists are [2,3], [3,2], [4,4], which are the same as the input lists. But why are the lists not halved? Because they aren't composed of identical halves, so the entire list is kept. Then, since the input has duplicate lists (each list appears twice), the output keeps only the first occurrence. So the overall pattern would be:\n\nFor each list in the input:\n\n- If the list is composed of two identical halves, output the first half.\n\n- Else, output the entire list.\n\nThen, from the resulting lists, remove any duplicates.\n\nBut in Example 0 and 1, after taking the first half, the lists are unique, so no need to deduplicate. In Example 2, the lists are kept as is, but since they are duplicated in the input, deduplicate.\n\nLet's test this hypothesis.\n\nExample 0: All input lists are composed of two identical halves. So output first halves. No duplicates in output, so no need to remove.\n\nExample 1: Similarly, input lists are two identical halves. Output first halves, no duplicates.\n\nExample 2: Input lists are not two identical halves. So output entire lists. But in the input, these lists are repeated, so output the unique ones.\n\nTest Input:\n\nEach list is of length 3, which is odd. So can't be split into two equal halves. So according to the pattern, output the entire list. But the input lists are:\n\n[5,4,5], [4,5,4], [6,6,4], [2,6,2], then repeated.\n\nSo output would be these four lists, but since they appear twice, deduplicate them. So the output is the first four lists. But the test input has eight lists, which are four unique lists each appearing twice. So the output should be the four unique lists. But looking at the training examples, in Example 2, the output is the first three unique lists. So in this case, the Test Input's output should be the first four unique lists, each appearing once.\n\nBut the Test Input's lists are:\n\nOriginal input:\n\n[5,4,5]\n\n[4,5,4]\n\n[6,6,4]\n\n[2,6,2]\n\nThen repeated:\n\n[5,4,5]\n\n[4,5,4]\n\n[6,6,4]\n\n[2,6,2]\n\nSo after deduplication, the output is the first four lists. But since each list is duplicated, the output would be each unique list once. So the output should be:\n\n[5,4,5]\n\n[4,5,4]\n\n[6,6,4]\n\n[2,6,2]\n\nBut each list is length 3, so according to the pattern, they are not split into halves (since length is odd), so entire lists are kept, then duplicates are removed. So the output is four lists. But looking at the training example 2, when the input has 6 lists (each of two elements), the output is three unique lists. So the pattern seems to be: for each list, if it's composed of two identical halves, output the first half; else, output the entire list. Then, remove duplicate lists from the input.\n\nSo applying this to the Test Input:\n\nEach list is length 3 (odd), so output entire list. Then, remove duplicates. The input lists are eight in total: four unique ones each repeated twice. So deduplicate, output the four unique lists in their first occurrence order.\n\nSo the expected output would be:\n\n[5,4,5]\n\n[4,5,4]\n\n[6,6,4]\n\n[2,6,2]\n\nBut looking at the training examples, the outputs are:\n\nExample 0: Each input list is split into first half.\n\nExample 1: same.\n\nExample 2: output the unique lists, which are the same as the first half of the input lists (since the input lists are arranged in two groups of three, which are duplicates). So in the test input, the first four lists are the unique ones, and the next four are duplicates. So deduplicate by taking each unique list once. Thus, the output would have four lists.\n\nBut the problem is, how to determine when to split the lists and when to deduplicate. The pattern seems to be:\n\n- For each list in the input, if it can be split into two equal halves that are identical, then output the first half. Otherwise, output the entire list.\n\n- Then, in the resulting list of lists, remove any consecutive or duplicate entries, retaining only the first occurrence.\n\nBut in Example 2, the lists are not split because their halves are not identical, so entire lists are kept. Then, the input lists are duplicated, so output the unique ones.\n\nSo applying this to the Test Input:\n\nCheck each list:\n\n[5,4,5] \u2192 can't split into two equal halves (length 3). So output entire list.\n\n[4,5,4] \u2192 same.\n\n[6,6,4] \u2192 same.\n\n[2,6,2] \u2192 same.\n\nThen, these four lists are repeated again. So after processing each list as entire list, the output is these four lists, then duplicates are removed, resulting in the four unique lists.\n\nSo the final output is four lists.\n\nBut looking at the training examples, in Example 2, the output is the three unique lists. Which matches the number of unique lists in the input.\n\nSo for the test input, the output should be four lists, each being the unique lists in order.\n\nBut the problem requires that the response is in the same format as the training examples. Let's look at the training examples' output format.\n\nExample 0's output is four lists, each half the length of the input lists.\n\nExample 1's output is three lists, each half the length.\n\nExample 2's output is three lists, same length as input lists.\n\nSo the Test Input has eight lists. If the pattern is to take the first half of each list (if even length) or the entire list (if odd), then deduplicate the resulting lists.\n\nFor the Test Input:\n\nEach list has length 3 (odd). So according to the rule, output entire list. So after processing, we have eight lists. Then, deduplicate, keeping the first occurrence. So the first four are unique, and the next four are duplicates. So the output is the four unique lists.\n\nBut wait, in the Test Input, the first four lists are:\n\n[5,4,5]\n\n[4,5,4]\n\n[6,6,4]\n\n[2,6,2]\n\nThen the next four are the same as the first four. So when deduplicating, we remove the duplicates, resulting in the four unique lists. Thus, the output should be these four.\n\nBut let me verify this against the training examples. In Example 2, the input lists are:\n\n[2,3]\n\n[3,2]\n\n[4,4]\n\n[2,3]\n\n[3,2]\n\n[4,4]\n\nAfter processing (each list is kept as is, since length 2 is even but their halves are not identical?), then deduplicate. So the output is the three unique lists. So yes, the pattern is: process each list (split if even length and halves are identical; else keep as is), then deduplicate the resulting lists.\n\nBut how to determine if the halves are identical? For the Test Input lists, since they are length 3 (odd), they are kept as is. Then deduplicated.\n\nThus, the Test Input's output is four lists:\n\n[5,4,5]\n\n[4,5,4]\n\n[6,6,4]\n\n[2,6,2]\n\nBut in the training examples, Example 0 and 1 split the lists into first halves (if even and identical), and Example 2 keeps them as is (but not split because halves are not identical?), then deduplicates.\n\nBut how to know when the halves are identical?\n\nFor Example 0, input lists:\n\n[1,1,3,2,1,1,3,2] \u2192 split into [1,1,3,2] and [1,1,3,2] \u2192 identical. So output first half.\n\nYes, so when the list can be split into two identical halves, take first half.\n\nOtherwise, keep the entire list.\n\nSo applying this to Test Input lists:\n\nEach list is of length 3, so can't be split into two equal halves, so entire list is kept. Then, deduplicate.\n\nThus, the output should be the four unique lists.\n\nBut the Test Input's lists are eight, with each of the four unique lists repeated twice. So the output is four lists, each appearing once.\n\nSo the final answer should be:\n\n[5,4,5]\n\n[4,5,4]\n\n[6,6,4]\n\n[2,6,2]\n\nBut wait, in the training examples, the output in Example 2 has the same elements as the input lists. So for Test Input, the output lists should be the same as the unique input lists.\n\nYes, so the answer is four lists, each unique, in their first occurrence order.",

        "cot_2": "Okay, let's see. I need to figure out the pattern here. Let's look at the training examples first.\n\nStarting with Example 0. The input has four lines, each with 8 elements. The output has the same four lines but each with 4 elements. Wait, so the length was halved. Let me check each line:\n\nOriginal first line: [1,1,3,2,1,1,3,2] becomes [1,1,3,2]. Oh, right, it's the first half of the list. Because the original has 8 elements, the first four are taken. Let me check the others. Second input line: [1,1,3,3,1,1,3,3] \u2192 [1,1,3,3], again first half. Third line: same pattern. So the pattern here is taking the first half of each list.\n\nExample 1: Input lists have 6 elements each. Output has 3 elements. For the first input line [4,4,4,4,4,4], output is [4,4,4] which is first three elements (half of six is three). The next lines follow the same. So again, first half.\n\nExample 2: Input lists are of length 2. The outputs are the same as the inputs. Because taking half of 2 is 1, but wait the output is [2,3], which is the entire list. Wait, that's confusing. Wait, in Example 2, the input has six lines, each of length 2. The output has three lines. Wait, the original input is six lines, and the output is three lines. Wait, how does that work? Let me check:\n\nOriginal input for Example 2:\n\n[2,3]\n[3,2]\n[4,4]\n[2,3]\n[3,2]\n[4,4]\n\nOutput is:\n\n[2,3]\n[3,2]\n[4,4]\n\nAh, so the output is taking the first half of the entire list of lines. Because there are six lines, first three are kept. So the pattern here might be that for each line in the input, you take the first half of each individual list, but also the entire list of lines is being cut in half as well. Wait, in Example 0, the input had 4 lines, and output had 4 lines. So maybe that's not it. Wait, maybe each line is processed individually. For example, in Example 2, each line is of length 2. Taking half of 2 would be 1 element. But the output lines are the same as the input. So that contradicts the earlier pattern. Hmm. Wait, maybe I misunderstood.\n\nWait, let's re-express the problem. The input is a list of lists. For each sublist, apply a transformation to get the output. The examples show that:\n\nIn Example 0, each input sublist of length 8 is turned into a sublist of length 4 (half). Similarly in Example 1, each 6-element sublist becomes 3 elements. But in Example 2, each sublist is 2 elements, and the output is the same as the input. Wait, that's conflicting. Unless maybe there's a different rule when the length is even vs. odd. Wait, 2 elements would require taking half, which is 1 element, but the output is 2 elements. So that can't be.\n\nWait, looking at Example 2's input and output again. Wait the input has six lines, and the output has three lines. Oh, wait! Maybe the pattern is that for the entire input list (the list of lists), take the first half of the top-level list. For example, in Example 0, the input has four lines, output four lines. Wait no, that's the same. Example 0's input has four lines, output four lines. So that's not it. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe the pattern is that each individual sublist is halved in length, but if the length is even, take the first half. If the length is odd, maybe take half rounded down? Let's check Example 2. The sublist length is 2. Take the first half (1 element). But in the output, it's still two elements. So that's not matching.\n\nWait, perhaps the transformation is to remove duplicate consecutive lines. Let me check Example 2: the input is three pairs of lines. The output is the first three lines. Because the input is [2,3], [3,2], [4,4], [2,3], [3,2], [4,4]. The output is the first three, removing the duplicates. But then why in Example 0 the output is the same number of lines as the input? Because in Example 0, the input has four lines, output four. So that can't be.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each line is processed by taking the first half of the elements. Let's re-examine Example 2. The input lines each have two elements. The first half of two is one element. But the output lines have two elements. That's conflicting.\n\nWait, maybe the pattern is that the entire input is a repetition of the output. For example, in Example 2, the input is six lines which are two copies of the three output lines. So output is the first three lines, eliminating the repetition. Similarly, in Example 0, the input lines might be repeating each line twice. For example, the first input line in Example 0 is [1,1,3,2,1,1,3,2]. If you split it into two halves, each half is [1,1,3,2], and the output is just the first half. Then the next line is [1,1,3,3,1,1,3,3] which splits into two halves, first half is [1,1,3,3]. So that's the output. So for each line in the input, take the first half of the elements. Then, the output is the list of those first halves.\n\nThen, in Example 2, each input line is two elements. Taking the first half would be one element, but the output lines are two elements. Wait, that's conflicting. Wait, maybe for each line, the line is duplicated, and the output is the first occurrence. For example, in Example 0, each line is duplicated in the input. Wait, looking at the input for Example 0:\n\nThe input lines are:\n\n[1, 1, 3, 2, 1, 1, 3, 2]\n[1, 1, 3, 3, 1, 1, 3, 3]\n[3, 3, 1, 1, 3, 3, 1, 1]\n[2, 3, 1, 1, 2, 3, 1, 1]\n\nEach line is a list where the first four elements are the same as the next four. For example, the first line's first four are [1,1,3,2], then repeated again. The output is the first four elements. So the pattern here is that each line in the input is a repetition of the same elements twice. The output is the first half of each line.\n\nIn Example 1, the input lines are [4,4,4,4,4,4], which is three 4s followed by three 4s again. The output is [4,4,4], which is the first half. Similarly, the other lines in Example 1 are also repeated. The third line in input is [6,6,8,6,6,8], which is [6,6,8] followed by [6,6,8]. So the output is the first three elements.\n\nIn Example 2, the input lines are [2,3], [3,2], [4,4], [2,3], [3,2], [4,4]. So each line is duplicated. The output is the first three lines, which is the first half of the entire input. But the output lines are the same as their input lines. Wait, but each input line has two elements. If the pattern was to take the first half of each line, then each output line would have one element. But in Example 2, the output lines are the same as the input lines. So that's conflicting. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe the pattern is that each line is duplicated, and the output takes the first occurrence. For example, in Example 2, the input has six lines which are three unique lines each repeated twice. So the output is the first three unique lines, removing the duplicates.\n\nBut looking at Example 0 and 1, their outputs are the same as the input lines, but with each line's elements halved. So perhaps in those examples, each line was duplicated in elements, not in the lines themselves. So maybe the pattern is: for each line, take the first half of the elements (when the line is even-length, halve it; if odd, maybe take floor division). Then, for the list of lines, if there are duplicates, take only the first occurrence.\n\nWait, but in Example 2, each line is two elements. Taking the first half would be one element. But the output lines are still two elements. So that's not matching. So maybe the pattern for the lines is that each line is a repetition of a sublist twice. So the output for each line is that sublist once. So for example, in Example 0, each line is a sublist of four elements repeated twice. The output is the sublist once. In Example 1, each line is a sublist of three elements repeated twice. The output is the first three elements. In Example 2, each line is two elements. If they were repeated, then each line would be four elements. But in Example 2, each line is two elements, so perhaps that's a different case.\n\nWait, this is confusing. Let me re-examine Example 2 again. The input is six lines:\n\n[2,3]\n[3,2]\n[4,4]\n[2,3]\n[3,2]\n[4,4]\n\nThe output is the first three lines. So the pattern here is that the input lines are duplicated, and the output is the first half of the entire list of lines. So the output is the first three lines, since the input has six lines (three unique lines repeated twice). So the pattern here is that the input is a list of lines where each line is repeated twice. The output is the first occurrence of each line.\n\nSo combining these two patterns: for each line, take the first half of the elements (if the line is a repetition of a sublist twice), and also take the first half of the entire list of lines (if they are duplicated). But that seems a bit complex, but perhaps that's the case.\n\nSo in the test input:\n\nTest Input:\n\n[5,4,5]\n[4,5,4]\n[6,6,4]\n[2,6,2]\n[5,4,5]\n[4,5,4]\n[6,6,4]\n[2,6,2]\n\nThere are 8 lines. If we take the first half of the entire list, that would be 4 lines. The first four lines are:\n\n[5,4,5]\n[4,5,4]\n[6,6,4]\n[2,6,2]\n\nThen the next four are duplicates. So the output would be these four lines. Then, for each line, check if they are duplicated elements. Let's look at the first line: [5,4,5]. Length is 3. If the pattern is to split into two halves, but 3 is odd. So maybe the first half is 2 elements (since 3//2=1.5, but floor would be 1, or ceiling would be 2?). Wait, in the previous examples, when the line was even-length, the first half was exactly half. But in the case of odd-length lines, perhaps it's rounded up.\n\nWait, in Example 1, the line lengths were 6 (even), output 3. In Example 0, line lengths 8, output 4. For Example 2, line length 2, but output same. Wait, but in Example 2, the output was the entire line. So perhaps if the line is already of length that can't be split into two equal halves (like length 2), but that's possible. Wait, 2 elements: first half is 1 element. But the output was the same as the input. So that contradicts.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the lines in the input for Example 2 were not duplicated in their elements. For example, in Example 2, the lines are [2,3], which is not duplicated. But in the input, the lines are repeated. So the pattern is that the input is a list of lines where each line is repeated twice. The output is the first occurrence. So, for the entire list of lines, the output is the first half of the lines. For each individual line, if the line is a repetition of a sublist twice, then the output is the first half of that line. But for lines that are not repetitions (like in Example 2), perhaps they are left as-is.\n\nSo combining these two:\n\n1. For the entire list of lines, take the first half (i.e., if the list has N lines, take the first N/2 lines).\n\nBut in Example 0, the input has 4 lines, output 4 lines. So that doesn't fit. Wait, Example 0's input has four lines, output four lines. So taking first half would be two lines, but the output is four. So that can't be.\n\nWait, this is getting complicated. Let me try another approach.\n\nLooking at the outputs:\n\nIn Example 0, each output line is exactly the first half of the input line. So line 1 input [1,1,3,2,1,1,3,2] \u2192 output [1,1,3,2] (first four elements). Similarly for other lines.\n\nIn Example 1, each output line is first half of input line. For example, input line [4,4,4,4,4,4] \u2192 output [4,4,4], which is first three elements. Input line [6,4,8,6,4,8] \u2192 output [6,4,8].\n\nIn Example 2, each input line is [2,3], which is two elements. The output lines are the same. But according to the previous pattern, the output should be the first half, which would be [2], but here it's [2,3]. So that's conflicting.\n\nWait, maybe the pattern is different when the line length is even. Let me check:\n\nWait, in Example 2, each input line has length 2, but the output lines are of length 2. So perhaps when the line length is even, but taking the first half would result in a single element, but the output is full. So maybe the pattern isn't taking the first half of each line. Then, perhaps the pattern is that each input line is duplicated, and the output is the first occurrence. But in Example 0, each line in the input is duplicated in its elements (since each line is twice the length of the output line), and the output is the first occurrence. So for example, input line is original sublist repeated twice. So the output is the original sublist.\n\nIn that case, the pattern is that each line in the input is a repeated version of a base list, and the output is the base list. So for example:\n\nExample 0: each line is base list + base list. So output is base list.\n\nExample 1: same, each line is base list (length 3) repeated twice (total length 6). Output is base list.\n\nExample 2: each line is not repeated. But the entire list of lines is repeated. So the input lines are duplicated (each line appears twice), and the output is the first occurrence. So the output is the first half of the list of lines.\n\nAh! So perhaps there are two patterns here:\n\n1. For each line, if it is a repeated sequence (i.e., the first half equals the second half), then output the first half.\n\n2. For the entire list of lines, if it is a repeated sequence of lines (i.e., the entire list is a duplication of a base list of lines), then output the first half of the lines.\n\nSo combining these two:\n\nEach line is split into two halves. If the two halves are the same, output the first half. Otherwise, leave as is. Then, the entire list of lines is checked: if the entire list is duplicated (like in Example 2), then output the first half of the list.\n\nBut this might be too complex, but let's test with the examples.\n\nIn Example 0, each line is duplicated in elements. So for each line, split into two halves and output the first half. The entire list of lines isn't duplicated (since input has 4 lines, output 4 lines). So no change in the number of lines.\n\nIn Example 1, same: each line is duplicated in elements. So output each first half. Number of lines is same as input.\n\nIn Example 2: each line is not duplicated in elements (each line is two elements, but not a repeat of a single element). But the entire list of lines is duplicated. The input is six lines, which is three lines repeated twice. So output the first three lines. Each line is left as is because they are not duplicated in elements.\n\nSo for the test input:\n\nTest input lines:\n\n[5,4,5]\n[4,5,4]\n[6,6,4]\n[2,6,2]\n[5,4,5]\n[4,5,4]\n[6,6,4]\n[2,6,2]\n\nSo the entire list is eight lines, which is four base lines repeated twice. So the output should be the first four lines. Then, for each of those four lines, check if they are duplicated in elements. For example, the first line is [5,4,5]. Length is 3, so can't split into two equal halves. So perhaps leave as is. Second line [4,5,4] is length 3. Third line [6,6,4] is also length 3. Fourth line [2,6,2] is length 3. Since none of them can be split into two equal halves, their elements are not duplicated. So the output is the first four lines as is.\n\nSo the test output would be:\n\n[5,4,5]\n[4,5,4]\n[6,6,4]\n[2,6,2]\n\nBut wait, looking at the training examples, the output in Example 2 was three lines, which is the first half of six input lines. Similarly, the test input has eight lines, so the first half is four lines.\n\nSo applying that pattern, the test output should be the first four lines, each line as is.\n\nBut wait, let's check the training examples again. In Example 0, each line was split into two halves. But the entire list of lines wasn't split. In Example 1, the same. Only Example 2 had the entire list of lines split into first half. So perhaps the pattern is: if the lines themselves are duplicated (their elements are duplicated), then split them. If the entire list of lines is duplicated, then split the list. So which takes precedence?\n\nAlternatively, the pattern is: both transformations are applied. First, for each line, if it is a duplicated sequence of elements, output the first half. Then, if the entire list of lines is a duplication, output the first half of the list.\n\nSo in Example 0, the lines are duplicated in elements. So each line is split. The entire list of lines is not duplicated (since there are four lines, not duplicated from two), so no change in the number of lines. So output four lines.\n\nIn Example 1, same: lines are split, list not duplicated.\n\nIn Example 2, the lines are not duplicated in elements (each line is two elements, but not a repeat of one). But the list is duplicated (six lines = three repeated twice). So output first three lines.\n\nSo applying this to the test input:\n\nThe entire list of lines is eight lines, which is four lines repeated twice. So output the first four lines. Each of these four lines: check if they are duplicated in elements. Let's see:\n\nFirst line: [5,4,5]. Length 3, which is odd. Can't split into two equal halves. So leave as is.\n\nSecond line: [4,5,4]. Length 3. Same.\n\nThird line: [6,6,4]. Length 3.\n\nFourth line: [2,6,2]. Length 3.\n\nSo none of these lines are duplicates of a base sublist. So output each as is.\n\nThus, the test output would be the first four lines:\n\n[5,4,5]\n[4,5,4]\n[6,6,4]\n[2,6,2]\n\nBut let's check the training examples again to see if this pattern holds.\n\nExample 0:\n\nInput lines are four lines. Each line is eight elements, which are two repeats of four elements. So output is four lines, each being the first four elements.\n\nExample 1:\n\nInput lines are three lines (wait, in Example 1, the input has three lines, each six elements. Output three lines, each three elements. So each line is split into first half.\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput six lines (three pairs). Output three lines (first half of list). Lines are two elements, not split.\n\nSo the pattern seems to be:\n\nFor each line, if the line can be divided into two equal halves where each half is the same, then output the first half. Otherwise, output the line as is. Then, if the entire list of lines can be divided into two equal halves where each half is the same, output the first half of the list. Otherwise, output the list as is.\n\nBut this might be a bit too complex. Let's check if that's the case.\n\nIn the test input, the entire list is eight lines, which is four lines repeated twice. So the output would be the first four lines. Each of these lines has three elements, which cannot be split into two equal halves. So output them as is.\n\nSo the final output should be:\n\n[5,4,5]\n[4,5,4]\n[6,6,4]\n[2,6,2]\n\nLooking at the training examples' outputs, they all follow this structure. For example, Example 0's output lines are half the length of input lines. Example 1's outputs are half. Example 2's outputs are the same as the first half of the input lines (three lines instead of six).\n\nSo the pattern is:\n\nFor each line in the input, if the line can be split into two equal parts where the first part equals the second part, then take the first part. Otherwise, leave the line as is.\n\nThen, for the entire list of lines, if the list can be split into two equal parts where the first part equals the second part, then take the first part. Otherwise, leave as is.\n\nSo in Example 0, each line is a duplicated pair. So each line is split. The entire list of lines is not duplicated, so the number of lines remains.\n\nIn Example 1, same: lines are split, entire list is not duplicated.\n\nIn Example 2, lines are not duplicated in elements, but the entire list is duplicated. So take the first half of the list.\n\nIn the test input, the entire list is duplicated. So take the first four lines. Each line in those four is not duplicated in elements, so they are left as is.\n\nThus, the test output should be the first four lines of the input, each as is."
