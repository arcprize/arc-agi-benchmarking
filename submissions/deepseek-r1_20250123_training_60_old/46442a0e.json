        "cot_1": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. So, looking at the training examples, the output seems to be some transformation of the input arrays. Let's start with Example 0.\n\nIn Example 0, the input is two rows: [8,6] and [6,8]. The output has four rows, each with four elements. The first output row is [8,6,6,8], which looks like the first input row followed by the second input row reversed. Then the second output row is [6,8,8,6], which is the second input row followed by the first reversed. The third row is the same as the second, and the fourth is the same as the first. Wait, maybe it's mirrored. Let me check.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each row in the output is formed by mirroring the original rows. For example, taking each input row and appending its reverse, but then arranging the rows in a certain pattern. Let's see:\n\nOriginal input for Example 0:\n[8,6]\n[6,8]\n\nOutput rows:\n[8,6,6,8] \u2013 which is input row 1 concatenated with input row 2 reversed? Or maybe input row 1 concatenated with input row 2. Wait, input row 2 is [6,8], so reversed would be [8,6], but the concatenation would be [8,6] + [8,6] reversed? Wait, no. Let me think again.\n\nWait, the first output row is [8,6,6,8]. The first part is [8,6], which is the first input row, then the second part is [6,8], which is the second input row. But wait, the second input row is [6,8], so maybe the first part is row 1, then row 2. Then the second output row is [6,8,8,6], which is row 2 followed by row 1 reversed. Hmm. Then the third row is same as the second, and fourth same as first. So maybe the output is constructed by creating a square where each row is a combination of original rows, possibly mirrored and duplicated.\n\nLooking at Example 1:\n\nInput has three rows:\n[7,7,8]\n[7,7,8]\n[8,8,8]\n\nOutput is six rows, each with six elements. The first two rows of output are [7,7,8,8,7,7]. That's the input row 1 (7,7,8) followed by reversed input row 1 (8,7,7) reversed? Wait, if you take the first input row [7,7,8], reverse it to get [8,7,7], then concatenate, you get [7,7,8,8,7,7], which matches the first two output rows. Then the third and fourth rows are all 8s, which corresponds to input row 3 [8,8,8], reversed is same, so concatenated gives [8,8,8,8,8,8]. Then the fifth and sixth rows are again [7,7,8,8,7,7]. So perhaps each input row is concatenated with its reverse, and then each such concatenated row is duplicated. Then the output is arranged by stacking these duplicated rows for each input row, but in a way that mirrors the original input's structure.\n\nWait, for Example 1, the output has 6 rows. The input has 3 rows. Each input row becomes two rows in the output. So the number of output rows is double the input rows. But wait, in Example 0, input has 2 rows, output has 4 rows, which is double. In Example 1, input has 3 rows, output has 6 rows. So that holds. Then in Example 2, input has 3 rows, output has 6 rows. So the pattern seems to be that each row in the input is transformed into two rows in the output. Now, how exactly?\n\nLooking at the structure of the output rows. For each input row, perhaps the output is the original row concatenated with the reversed row. Then that's one row. Then another row that is reversed of that concatenation? Or perhaps each input row is mirrored, and then the mirrored rows are arranged in some way.\n\nWait, in Example 1, input row 1 is [7,7,8]. Concatenated with its reverse [8,7,7] gives [7,7,8,8,7,7], which is the first two output rows. Then input row 3 is [8,8,8], reversed is same, so concatenated gives [8,8,8,8,8,8], which is two rows. Then input row 2 is same as row 1, so same output. So the output rows are two copies of each concatenated row.\n\nBut wait, in Example 0, input rows are [8,6] and [6,8]. Each row concatenated with reversed would be [8,6,6,8] and [6,8,8,6]. Then output rows are these two, each repeated twice. But in the output, the order is [8,6,6,8], [6,8,8,6], [6,8,8,6], [8,6,6,8]. So it's like mirroring the list of rows. So the output rows for Example 0 are the concatenated rows followed by their mirror. So first the two concatenated rows, then the reverse of those two, leading to four rows. Because 2 input rows, each becomes one concatenated row, then the list of concatenated rows is mirrored.\n\nWait, in Example 0, the concatenated rows would be [8,6,6,8] and [6,8,8,6]. Then the output is those two rows, followed by the same two rows in reverse order. So rows 1 and 2 become rows 1 and 2 of output, then rows 2 and 1 again. So total four rows.\n\nSimilarly, in Example 1, the concatenated rows would be [7,7,8,8,7,7], [7,7,8,8,7,7], [8,8,8,8,8,8]. Then the output is these three, followed by their reverse order. So three rows, then three again, total six. Which matches the output.\n\nThen Example 2. Let's see. The input is three rows:\n\nRow1: [6,9,9]\n\nRow2: [6,4,4]\n\nRow3: [6,4,4]\n\nEach row is concatenated with its reverse. So row1 becomes [6,9,9,9,9,6] (original [6,9,9], reversed is [9,9,6], concatenated gives [6,9,9,9,9,6]? Wait, wait, the original row is length 3. Reversed would be [9,9,6], so concatenating gives [6,9,9,9,9,6]. Wait, but the first output row in Example 2 is [6,9,9,6,6,6]. Hmm, that doesn't match. So maybe my previous assumption is wrong.\n\nWait, the output for Example 2's first row is [6,9,9,6,6,6]. The input row 1 is [6,9,9]. If we take that row and append the reversed row of row1, but reversed row1 is [9,9,6], so concatenating gives [6,9,9,9,9,6], which is not what's in the output. So that's a problem. So maybe the pattern is different.\n\nLooking at Example 2's output:\n\nFirst row: [6,9,9,6,6,6]\n\nSecond row: [6,4,4,4,4,9]\n\nThird row: [6,4,4,4,4,9]\n\nFourth row: [9,4,4,4,4,6]\n\nFifth row: [9,4,4,4,4,6]\n\nSixth row: [6,6,6,9,9,6]\n\nHmm. Let's see. The input rows are:\n\nRow1: [6,9,9]\n\nRow2: [6,4,4]\n\nRow3: [6,4,4]\n\nEach input row is transformed in a way. For example, row1's output is [6,9,9,6,6,6]. Let's break that down. The first three elements are [6,9,9], which is the original row. Then the next three are [6,6,6]. Where does that come from? Maybe the first element of the row (6) is repeated three times. Then for row2: [6,4,4] becomes [6,4,4,4,4,9]. The first three elements are the original row. The next three are [4,4,9]. Not sure. Wait, 9 is the last element of row1. Maybe there's some interaction between rows.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each row in the output is constructed by taking the original row and appending some transformation of another row. For example, in Example 0, each row is followed by another row's reversed version.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is created by creating a grid where each original element is mirrored in some way. Let's look at the dimensions. For input m rows of n elements, the output is 2m rows of 2n elements. In Example 0: input 2x2, output 4x4. Example 1: input 3x3, output 6x6. Example 2: input 3x3, output 6x6. So the output is a doubling in both dimensions. So each input element is somehow expanded into a 2x2 block.\n\nWait, that might be the case. For example, in Example 0:\n\nInput is:\n\n8 6\n\n6 8\n\nOutput is:\n\n8 6 6 8\n\n6 8 8 6\n\n6 8 8 6\n\n8 6 6 8\n\nLooking at each element in the input, perhaps each element is replaced by a 2x2 block. Let's see:\n\nOriginal element 8 in position (0,0) might become:\n\n8 6\n\n6 8?\n\nWait, but the first row of output is 8 6 6 8. If the input's first row is [8,6], then perhaps each element is expanded into a 2x2 block. For 8, maybe the block is [8,6;6,8] (but I'm not sure). Alternatively, each element is mirrored in some way.\n\nAlternatively, the output is a combination of the original matrix and its transpose, or some reflection.\n\nWait, perhaps the output matrix is constructed by first concatenating each row with its reverse, then stacking the rows followed by the reverse of the rows. Let's test this.\n\nFor Example 0:\n\nEach input row is [8,6], [6,8].\n\nConcatenating each with its reverse:\n\nRow1 becomes [8,6,6,8], row2 becomes [6,8,8,6].\n\nThen stack these two rows, then stack their reversed order: [row1, row2, row2, row1]. Which gives the output as in Example 0.\n\nSimilarly for Example 1:\n\nEach row is [7,7,8], [7,7,8], [8,8,8].\n\nConcatenated with their reverses:\n\nRow1: [7,7,8,8,7,7]\n\nRow2: same as row1.\n\nRow3: [8,8,8,8,8,8].\n\nThen stack them, then stack the reverse of the list of rows. So output would be [row1, row2, row3, row3, row2, row1]. Wait, but in Example 1's output, the order is row1, row1, row3, row3, row1, row1. Hmm, that's not matching. Wait the output of Example1 is:\n\nFirst two rows: [7,7,8,8,7,7]\n\nThird and fourth: [8,8,8,8,8,8]\n\nFifth and sixth: [7,7,8,8,7,7]\n\nSo the order is [row1, row1, row3, row3, row1, row1]. But according to the previous logic, if we take the concatenated rows and then mirror the list, it would be row1, row2, row3, row3, row2, row1. But in this case, row1 and row2 are the same, so the output becomes two of row1, two of row3, then two of row1 again. So maybe that's the pattern.\n\nBut how does that work for Example2?\n\nLet's see. Input rows:\n\nRow1: [6,9,9]\n\nRow2: [6,4,4]\n\nRow3: [6,4,4]\n\nEach row concatenated with reversed would be:\n\nRow1: [6,9,9] + reversed [9,9,6] \u2192 [6,9,9,9,9,6]\n\nRow2: [6,4,4] + reversed [4,4,6] \u2192 [6,4,4,4,4,6]\n\nRow3: same as row2 \u2192 [6,4,4,4,4,6]\n\nBut the actual output for Example2 is different. The first output row is [6,9,9,6,6,6], which doesn't match. So this suggests that the previous approach is incorrect.\n\nHmm. Maybe there's a different pattern. Let's look at Example2's input and output again.\n\nInput:\n\nRow1: [6,9,9]\n\nRow2: [6,4,4]\n\nRow3: [6,4,4]\n\nOutput:\n\n[6,9,9,6,6,6]\n\n[6,4,4,4,4,9]\n\n[6,4,4,4,4,9]\n\n[9,4,4,4,4,6]\n\n[9,4,4,4,4,6]\n\n[6,6,6,9,9,6]\n\nHmm. Let's see if each row in the output is formed by combining elements from the original input in a certain way.\n\nLooking at the first output row: [6,9,9,6,6,6]. The first three elements are the original row1 [6,9,9]. Then the next three are [6,6,6]. Maybe the 6 comes from row2's first element (6), row3's first element (6), and row1's first element (6)? But not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the output rows might be combinations of original rows and some transformed versions. For example, the first part of the output row is the original row, and the second part is another row reversed or modified.\n\nLooking at the first output row of Example2: [6,9,9,6,6,6]. The first three elements are row1, and the next three are [6,6,6]. The 6 could be the first element of row1 (6), repeated three times. So maybe for each input row, the output row is the original row followed by the first element of the row repeated three times. But then for row2, the output would be [6,4,4,6,6,6], but in the actual output, row2's output is [6,4,4,4,4,9]. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each row in the output is formed by appending a transformation based on other rows. Let's think about symmetry. The entire output for Example2 seems to have some symmetry. The first and last output rows are related. The second and third, fourth and fifth are similar. Maybe the output is a reflection of some kind.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is constructed by creating a larger matrix where each element from the input is placed in a certain pattern. For example, each element in the input is placed in a 2x2 block in the output, but the arrangement depends on the element's position.\n\nLooking at Example0's input:\n\nOriginal 2x2 matrix:\n\n8 6\n\n6 8\n\nOutput 4x4:\n\n8 6 | 6 8\n\n6 8 | 8 6\n\n-------------\n\n6 8 | 8 6\n\n8 6 | 6 8\n\nSo each quadrant is a copy or a mirrored version. The top-left quadrant is the original, top-right is original reversed column-wise, bottom-left is original reversed row-wise, and bottom-right is original reversed both ways.\n\nAlternatively, the output is a Kronecker product with a certain matrix, but that might be too complex.\n\nAnother approach: Let's look for how each input element is represented in the output. For Example0:\n\nInput element (0,0)=8 appears in output positions (0,0), (0,3), (3,0), (3,3).\n\nInput element (0,1)=6 appears in (0,1), (0,2), (3,1), (3,2).\n\nSimilarly, element (1,0)=6 appears in (1,0), (1,3), (2,0), (2,3).\n\nElement (1,1)=8 appears in (1,1), (1,2), (2,1), (2,2).\n\nSo each element is duplicated into a 2x2 block, but arranged in a mirrored way. For example, element (i,j) is placed at (2i, 2j), (2i, 2j+1), (2i+1, 2j), (2i+1, 2j+1), but with some reflection. Wait, in Example0, the output is double the size. So each element in the input is turned into a 2x2 block in the output. For example, the element 8 at (0,0) becomes the top-left 2x2 block: [8,6;6,8]. Wait, but in the output:\n\nRow0: 8 6 6 8\n\nRow1: 6 8 8 6\n\nRow2: 6 8 8 6\n\nRow3: 8 6 6 8\n\nSo each element in the input is expanded into a 2x2 block where the block is the original element followed by the element to its right (for the first row of the block) and the element below and the element diagonally. Hmm, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, each element is replaced by a 2x2 matrix where the first row is [element, next element in row], and the second row is [element below, next element below and right]. But this might not hold across examples.\n\nAlternatively, for each element in the input matrix, the output has a 2x2 block where the elements are arranged based on the original element's row and column. For example, for input[i][j], the output at positions (2i, 2j), (2i, 2j+1), (2i+1, 2j), (2i+1, 2j+1) are determined by some function of the original elements.\n\nLooking at Example0:\n\nOriginal element 8 at (0,0):\n\nIn output, positions (0,0) is 8, (0,1) is 6, (1,0) is 6, (1,1) is 8.\n\nSo the block for 8 at (0,0) is:\n\n[8, 6]\n\n[6, 8]\n\nWhich is the original element, the element to the right, the element below, and the element diagonally right and below.\n\nSimilarly, element (0,1)=6:\n\nOutput positions (0,2)=6, (0,3)=8, (1,2)=8, (1,3)=6.\n\nWhich is [6,8;8,6], which corresponds to the element to the right (but there is none, so perhaps wrapping around?), but this seems inconsistent.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is created by mirroring the input matrix both horizontally and vertically, then combining.\n\nAnother idea: The output is the original matrix concatenated with its horizontal flip, then vertically concatenated with the vertical flip of that.\n\nFor Example0:\n\nOriginal matrix:\n\n8 6\n\n6 8\n\nHorizontal flip (reverse each row):\n\n6 8\n\n8 6\n\nConcatenate original and horizontal flip horizontally:\n\n8 6 6 8\n\n6 8 8 6\n\nThen vertical flip of this concatenated matrix:\n\n6 8 8 6\n\n8 6 6 8\n\nThen concatenate vertically, giving:\n\n8 6 6 8\n\n6 8 8 6\n\n6 8 8 6\n\n8 6 6 8\n\nWhich matches Example0's output.\n\nAh, this seems promising. Let's check for Example1.\n\nExample1's input:\n\n7 7 8\n\n7 7 8\n\n8 8 8\n\nHorizontal flip of each row:\n\n8 7 7\n\n8 7 7\n\n8 8 8\n\nConcatenate original and flipped horizontally:\n\n7 7 8 8 7 7\n\n7 7 8 8 7 7\n\n8 8 8 8 8 8\n\nThen vertically flip this concatenated matrix:\n\n8 8 8 8 8 8\n\n7 7 8 8 7 7\n\n7 7 8 8 7 7\n\nThen concatenate vertically, giving:\n\n7 7 8 8 7 7\n\n7 7 8 8 7 7\n\n8 8 8 8 8 8\n\n8 8 8 8 8 8\n\n7 7 8 8 7 7\n\n7 7 8 8 7 7\n\nWhich matches Example1's output.\n\nThis seems to fit. Now check Example2.\n\nExample2's input:\n\nRow1: 6 9 9\n\nRow2:6 4 4\n\nRow3:6 4 4\n\nHorizontal flip of each row:\n\nRow1 flipped:9 9 6\n\nRow2 flipped:4 4 6\n\nRow3 flipped:4 4 6\n\nConcatenate each row with its flipped version:\n\nRow1:6 9 9 9 9 6\n\nRow2:6 4 4 4 4 6\n\nRow3:6 4 4 4 4 6\n\nThen vertically flip this concatenated matrix:\n\nRow3:6 4 4 4 4 6 \u2192 flipped vertically becomes row3:6 4 4 4 4 6?\n\nWait, vertical flip of the concatenated matrix would reverse the order of the rows. The concatenated matrix before vertical flip is:\n\nRow1:6 9 9 9 9 6\n\nRow2:6 4 4 4 4 6\n\nRow3:6 4 4 4 4 6\n\nVertically flipping this would give:\n\nRow3:6 4 4 4 4 6\n\nRow2:6 4 4 4 4 6\n\nRow1:6 9 9 9 9 6\n\nThen concatenate vertically, the original concatenated matrix followed by the vertically flipped one:\n\nRow1:6 9 9 9 9 6\n\nRow2:6 4 4 4 4 6\n\nRow3:6 4 4 4 4 6\n\nRow3:6 4 4 4 4 6\n\nRow2:6 4 4 4 4 6\n\nRow1:6 9 9 9 9 6\n\nBut the actual output for Example2 is different. For example, the first output row is [6,9,9,6,6,6], which doesn't match. So this approach doesn't fit Example2.\n\nHmm. There's a contradiction here. So perhaps the initial pattern holds for Examples 0 and 1, but not for 2, which suggests that the pattern might be more complex.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps in Example2, there's an additional step. Looking at Example2's output:\n\nThe first row is [6,9,9,6,6,6]. The first three elements are the original row1, but the next three are [6,6,6]. Where does this come from? The horizontal flip of row1 is [9,9,6], so concatenated would be [6,9,9,9,9,6], but that's not what's in the output. So maybe there's a different transformation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the horizontal flip is not the entire row, but the row is reversed but then modified in some way. For example, in Example2's row1, the original is [6,9,9], reversed is [9,9,6]. But maybe instead of appending the reversed row, they are appending a modified version. For example, the first element of the reversed row is replaced with the first element of the original row.\n\nWait, let's see. Original row1 is [6,9,9], reversed is [9,9,6]. If we take the first element of the original (6) and replace the first element of the reversed row, we get [6,9,6]. Then concatenating gives [6,9,9,6,9,6]. Not matching the output.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the reversed row is modified by taking each element and replacing it with the first element of the original row. For example, reversed row [9,9,6] becomes [6,6,6], so concatenated row becomes [6,9,9,6,6,6], which matches the first output row of Example2. Let's test this hypothesis.\n\nFor row1 in Example2: original [6,9,9], reversed [9,9,6]. Replace each element in the reversed part with the first element of the original row (6), so reversed part becomes [6,6,6]. So concatenated row is [6,9,9,6,6,6], which matches the first output row.\n\nFor row2 in Example2: original [6,4,4], reversed is [4,4,6]. Replace each element in reversed part with the first element of row2, which is 6. So reversed part becomes [6,6,6], concatenated row would be [6,4,4,6,6,6]. But the actual output for row2 is [6,4,4,4,4,9]. So that's not matching. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each element in the reversed part is replaced with the corresponding element from another row. For Example2's row2: original [6,4,4]. reversed part [4,4,6]. Maybe replace with elements from row1's reversed part. Wait, this is getting complicated.\n\nLooking at Example2's output rows:\n\nRow1: [6,9,9,6,6,6]\n\nRow2: [6,4,4,4,4,9]\n\nRow3: [6,4,4,4,4,9]\n\nRow4: [9,4,4,4,4,6]\n\nRow5: [9,4,4,4,4,6]\n\nRow6: [6,6,6,9,9,6]\n\nNotice that row6 is the reverse of row1. Similarly, row4 and row5 are reverses of rows2 and 3. So perhaps the output is formed by taking each row concatenated with some transformed version, then stacking the rows followed by their reverses.\n\nFor example, take each input row and concatenate it with some transformed version (maybe the reverse of another row), then the output rows are these concatenated rows followed by their reverses.\n\nBut this is getting too vague. Let's think of another approach.\n\nLooking at the test input:\n\n[1,4,1]\n\n[4,9,4]\n\n[9,1,9]\n\nIf the pattern is as in Examples 0 and 1 (concatenate each row with its horizontal flip and then vertically concatenate the vertical flip), then each row would be concatenated with its reversed version.\n\nFor the first row [1,4,1], reversed is [1,4,1]. So concatenated row is [1,4,1,1,4,1].\n\nSecond row [4,9,4], reversed is [4,9,4], concatenated [4,9,4,4,9,4].\n\nThird row [9,1,9], reversed [9,1,9], concatenated [9,1,9,9,1,9].\n\nThen vertically stack these three rows, then stack their vertical flip (same as before, since all rows are symmetric). So the output would be six rows:\n\n[1,4,1,1,4,1]\n\n[4,9,4,4,9,4]\n\n[9,1,9,9,1,9]\n\n[9,1,9,9,1,9]\n\n[4,9,4,4,9,4]\n\n[1,4,1,1,4,1]\n\nBut the training Example2's output doesn't fit this pattern, so this may not be the right approach.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is different. Let's re-examine Example2.\n\nInput:\n\nRow1: [6,9,9]\n\nRow2: [6,4,4]\n\nRow3: [6,4,4]\n\nOutput rows:\n\n[6,9,9,6,6,6]\n\n[6,4,4,4,4,9]\n\n[6,4,4,4,4,9]\n\n[9,4,4,4,4,6]\n\n[9,4,4,4,4,6]\n\n[6,6,6,9,9,6]\n\nLooking at the first output row: [6,9,9,6,6,6]. The first three elements are row1. The next three elements are [6,6,6]. Where does that come from? Perhaps the first element of row1 (6) repeated three times. \n\nSecond output row: [6,4,4,4,4,9]. The first three are row2 [6,4,4], then next three are [4,4,9]. 4 is the second element of row2, and 9 is the third element of row1. \n\nThird row is same as second.\n\nFourth row: [9,4,4,4,4,6]. The first three elements are [9,4,4], which could be row1's reversed (9,9,6) modified to 9,4,4. Not sure. The last three are [4,4,6], which could be row3's elements. \n\nThis seems too arbitrary. \n\nAlternatively, maybe each row is transformed by taking the original row and appending a modified version of another row. For example, row1 is followed by row2's reverse, but modified. \n\nAlternatively, the pattern involves the position of the element. For example, in the output, each element in the original matrix is mapped to a 2x2 block where the elements are derived from the original element's position. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is constructed by creating a larger matrix that is a combination of the original matrix and its transpose, or some rotation.\n\nAnother approach: Looking for relationships between the input and output elements.\n\nIn Example0's output, each element in the original input appears four times in the output. For example, 8 appears in positions (0,0), (0,3), (3,0), (3,3), and similarly for 6.\n\nIn Example1's output, the element 7 appears in the corners of the first two rows and last two rows, and 8 is in the middle. \n\nBut in Example2, the elements vary more. So perhaps the pattern isn't uniform across all examples. \n\nWait, maybe the pattern is to duplicate each row and column. For example, each row is duplicated, and each element is duplicated. But that doesn't explain the varying elements.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is the input matrix multiplied by its transpose or some other matrix operation. But matrix multiplication for Example0's 2x2 matrix would give a 2x2 matrix, not 4x4.\n\nHmm. Maybe it's time to look for a different pattern. Let's look for the number of elements in the output. For each example:\n\nExample0: input has 4 elements (2x2), output has 16 (4x4). So each element is replicated four times. But how?\n\nExample1: input 9 elements (3x3), output 36 (6x6). Each element four times. Example2: same as Example1. So each input element is represented four times in the output. \n\nBut how are they arranged? For Example0, each input element is in a 2x2 block. For example, 8 in (0,0) appears in (0,0), (0,3), (3,0), (3,3). So each element is placed in four corners of a 2x2 block in the output.\n\nWait, for Example0's input:\n\nRow0: 8 6\n\nRow1:6 8\n\nOutput:\n\nRow0:8 6 6 8\n\nRow1:6 8 8 6\n\nRow2:6 8 8 6\n\nRow3:8 6 6 8\n\nIf we divide the output into 2x2 blocks:\n\nBlock (0,0): 8 6; 6 8 \u2192 which is the original matrix.\n\nBlock (0,1):6 8;8 6 \u2192 which is the original matrix rotated 180 degrees.\n\nSimilarly, Block (1,0):6 8;8 6 \u2192 same as Block (0,1).\n\nBlock (1,1):8 6;6 8 \u2192 original matrix again.\n\nSo the output is formed by arranging the original matrix and its rotated versions in a 2x2 grid. But this would require that the output is a 2x2 grid of the original matrix and its rotations. But this may not fit for Example1.\n\nExample1's input is a 3x3 matrix. The output is a 6x6 matrix, which could be a 2x2 grid of the original and its rotations, but scaled. However, 3x3 doesn't divide evenly into 2x2 blocks. Alternatively, each 3x3 block is transformed into a 6x6 block in a different way.\n\nThis seems too complicated. Let's try a different approach.\n\nLooking at the test input:\n\n[1,4,1]\n\n[4,9,4]\n\n[9,1,9]\n\nIf we follow the pattern from Example0 and Example1 (concatenate each row with its reversed version, then stack the rows followed by their reverse), the output would be:\n\nEach row becomes its original plus reversed. Then the rows are stacked and then stacked again in reverse order.\n\nFor example:\n\nRow1: [1,4,1] \u2192 reversed is [1,4,1], so concatenated row is [1,4,1,1,4,1].\n\nRow2: [4,9,4] \u2192 reversed [4,9,4] \u2192 concatenated [4,9,4,4,9,4].\n\nRow3: [9,1,9] \u2192 reversed [9,1,9] \u2192 concatenated [9,1,9,9,1,9].\n\nThen stack these three rows, then stack them again in reverse order. So the output would be six rows:\n\nRow1: [1,4,1,1,4,1]\n\nRow2: [4,9,4,4,9,4]\n\nRow3: [9,1,9,9,1,9]\n\nRow4: [9,1,9,9,1,9]\n\nRow5: [4,9,4,4,9,4]\n\nRow6: [1,4,1,1,4,1]\n\nBut looking at Example2's output, this doesn't fit. So perhaps this pattern is not correct. But the test input might follow this pattern. However, Example2's output doesn't fit, so there must be a different pattern.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation involves swapping certain elements or adding elements from other rows.\n\nIn Example2's output, the second row is [6,4,4,4,4,9]. The first three elements are row2 of the input, and the last three are [4,4,9]. The last element, 9, is from row1's last element. Maybe there's a pattern where each row is concatenated with the reverse of another row. For example, row1 is concatenated with the reverse of row3, row2 with reverse of row2, etc. \n\nBut this is speculative. Given the time constraints, perhaps the best approach is to assume that the pattern is to concatenate each row with its reverse, then stack the rows followed by their reverse, and apply that to the test input.\n\nFor the test input:\n\nEach row is:\n\n[1,4,1] \u2192 reversed is [1,4,1] \u2192 concatenated [1,4,1,1,4,1]\n\n[4,9,4] \u2192 reversed [4,9,4] \u2192 concatenated [4,9,4,4,9,4]\n\n[9,1,9] \u2192 reversed [9,1,9] \u2192 concatenated [9,1,9,9,1,9]\n\nStack these three rows:\n\nRow1: [1,4,1,1,4,1]\n\nRow2: [4,9,4,4,9,4]\n\nRow3: [9,1,9,9,1,9]\n\nThen stack the reverse of these rows:\n\nRow3: [9,1,9,9,1,9]\n\nRow2: [4,9,4,4,9,4]\n\nRow1: [1,4,1,1,4,1]\n\nSo the full output would be:\n\n[1,4,1,1,4,1]\n\n[4,9,4,4,9,4]\n\n[9,1,9,9,1,9]\n\n[9,1,9,9,1,9]\n\n[4,9,4,4,9,4]\n\n[1,4,1,1,4,1]\n\nBut in Example2's output, this is not the case, so this approach may be incorrect. However, given the time, perhaps this is the intended pattern, and Example2 has a different pattern due to some other rule.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the test input's output is as described, and the training examples have different patterns. But given the instructions, the pattern should be consistent across all training examples.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the pattern involves doubling each row and column, with some transformation. For example, each row is duplicated, and each element is followed by another element from the matrix. For Example0, each element is followed by the element to its right, then the row is duplicated. But this is not clear.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and the need to provide an answer, I'll proceed with the initial pattern that worked for Examples 0 and 1, even though Example2 is different. Maybe there's an error in my analysis of Example2, or perhaps the pattern is more complex. But applying the pattern to the test input:\n\nTest input rows are symmetric, so their reversed rows are the same. So the output would be:\n\n[1,4,1,1,4,1]\n\n[4,9,4,4,9,4]\n\n[9,1,9,9,1,9]\n\n[9,1,9,9,1,9]\n\n[4,9,4,4,9,4]\n\n[1,4,1,1,4,1]\n\nWhich follows the pattern of concatenating each row with its reverse and stacking with the vertical flip. This seems plausible, so I'll present this as the answer.",

        "cot_2": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. So, looking at the training examples, I need to see how the input arrays are transformed into the output. Let's start with Example 0.\n\nIn Example 0, the input is two rows: [8,6] and [6,8]. The output has four rows. The first output row is [8,6,6,8], which seems like the first input row followed by the reversed second row. The second output row is [6,8,8,6], which is the second input row followed by the reversed first row. Then the third row is the same as the second, and the fourth is the same as the first. So maybe each input row is mirrored with the reversed counterpart, and then duplicated?\n\nLooking at Example 1. The input has three rows: all [7,7,8], then [7,7,8], then [8,8,8]. The output is six rows. The first two lines are [7,7,8,8,7,7] repeated twice. Then the next two lines are all 8s. Then again the first pattern. So maybe each row is transformed by appending the reverse of itself? Let's check. The original row [7,7,8] reversed is [8,7,7], so combining them gives [7,7,8,8,7,7]. That's exactly the first two rows. Then the third row in input is [8,8,8], reversed is same, so output row is [8,8,8,8,8,8], which appears twice. Then again the first two transformed rows. So the pattern here seems like: for each row in input, create a new row by appending the reverse of the same row. Then, the number of times each transformed row appears in the output is equal to the number of rows in the input? Wait, example 0 has two input rows, output has four rows (each transformed row appears twice). Example 1 has three input rows, output has six rows (each transformed row appears twice). So perhaps the transformed rows are duplicated in the output as many times as the number of input rows? Or maybe the output's number of rows is double the input's rows. Because in example 0, input has 2 rows, output 4 (2x2). Example 1: input 3 rows, output 6 (3x2). Example 2: input 3 rows, output 6 rows. Wait, example 2's input is 3 rows, output is 6 rows. Yes. So the output's row count is double the input's row count.\n\nBut let's check example 2. Input is three rows:\n\n[6,9,9]\n[6,4,4]\n[6,4,4]\n\nOutput is six rows. Let's see each transformed row.\n\nFirst output row is [6,9,9,6,6,6]. Wait, original first row is [6,9,9]. If we reverse it, it's [9,9,6]. Then appending that gives [6,9,9,9,9,6], but the actual output is [6,9,9,6,6,6]. Hmm, that doesn't match. So maybe my initial assumption is wrong.\n\nWait, perhaps the transformation is different. Let's look at example 2's output:\n\nFirst output row: [6,9,9,6,6,6]. The first three elements are the original input row. The next three elements are 6,6,6. Where does that come from? The original first row is [6,9,9], perhaps the next part is taking the first element of the row (6) and repeating it three times? But 6 appears once, then 9,9. Then three 6s. So the transformed row is original row followed by three copies of the first element. Wait, but the original row is length 3, so the transformed row is length 6. So for each row in input, the transformed row is the original row concatenated with three copies of the first element. But let's check other rows.\n\nSecond output row: [6,4,4,4,4,9]. Original row is [6,4,4]. So original row is [6,4,4], then appended part is [4,4,9]. Hmm, that doesn't fit. Alternatively, maybe it's the original row followed by the reversed next row? Let's see. The input rows are:\n\nRow 0: [6,9,9]\n\nRow 1: [6,4,4]\n\nRow 2: [6,4,4]\n\nIn the output, first transformed row is [6,9,9,6,6,6]. If we take row 0 and append the reverse of row 0's first element thrice. Wait, 6 is the first element, so 6,6,6. That matches. Then the next transformed row is [6,4,4,4,4,9]. Original row is [6,4,4]. Appended part is [4,4,9]. Where does that come from? Maybe the first element of the next row? The next row is [6,4,4], first element is 6. Not matching. Alternatively, perhaps it's taking some elements from the same row. Let's see the row [6,4,4]. The last element is 4. If we take the last element and append 4,4,9. Wait, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is more complex. Let's see the second output row [6,4,4,4,4,9]. The original row is [6,4,4]. The appended part is [4,4,9]. Hmm, maybe the next row's elements. The next row after row 1 is row 2, which is [6,4,4]. But that's same as row1. So how to get 4,4,9? Not obvious.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each transformed row is a combination of the original row and another row from the input. For example, in example 0, the first transformed row is [8,6,6,8], which is original row [8,6] followed by reversed original row [6,8]. Then the second row is [6,8,8,6], which is row 2 [6,8] followed by reversed row1 [8,6]. So for example, in example 0, each input row is paired with the reversed next row? Wait, in example 0, there are two rows. So row0 is followed by reversed row1, row1 is followed by reversed row0. Then each transformed row is duplicated. Because output has four rows: row0 transformed appears twice, row1 transformed appears twice.\n\nIn example1, input has three rows. The output has six rows. So each transformed row is duplicated twice. So the pattern is: for each input row, create a new row by appending the reverse of another row (maybe next row?), then duplicate each transformed row as many times as the number of input rows divided by something.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformed row is original row followed by reversed version of the same row, but mirrored in a certain way. Wait, example1's first input row is [7,7,8]. Reverse is [8,7,7]. So transformed row would be [7,7,8,8,7,7], which matches the output. Then that row is duplicated twice. Similarly, the third input row is [8,8,8], reversed is same, so transformed row is [8,8,8,8,8,8], duplicated twice. So in example1, each input row's transformed version is duplicated twice. Since input has three rows, output has 3*2=6 rows.\n\nBut example0's input has two rows. Each transformed row is duplicated twice. So 2*2=4 rows. That fits. Example2's input has three rows, so output is 3*2=6 rows.\n\nSo the pattern is: for each input row, create a new row by taking the original row and appending its reverse. Then, duplicate each transformed row twice (for the number of rows equal to the input's row count times 2). Wait, no. Because example0's output has four rows (two transformed rows, each duplicated twice). Example1's output has six rows (three transformed rows, each duplicated twice). Example2's output has six rows, which is three transformed rows each duplicated twice. So yes. So the transformed output is each input row transformed (original + reversed), and then each transformed row is duplicated a number of times equal to the number of rows in the input divided by something. Wait, no. Because example0's input has two rows, each transformed row is duplicated twice (total 4 rows). Example1's input has three rows, each transformed row is duplicated twice (total 6 rows). So the number of duplicates per transformed row is two. So regardless of input rows, each transformed row is duplicated twice. But that can't be, because in example2's output, there are six rows. If the input has three rows, each transformed row is duplicated twice, then 3*2=6, which matches.\n\nSo the general pattern is: for each row in the input, create a new row by appending the reverse of the same row. Then, in the output, each transformed row is repeated twice. Then arrange the output rows in the same order as the input rows, each appearing twice.\n\nWait, but looking at example2's input:\n\nInput rows:\n\nRow0: [6,9,9]\n\nRow1: [6,4,4]\n\nRow2: [6,4,4]\n\nOutput rows:\n\n[6,9,9,6,6,6]\n\n[6,4,4,4,4,9]\n\n[6,4,4,4,4,9]\n\n[9,4,4,4,4,6]\n\n[9,4,4,4,4,6]\n\n[6,6,6,9,9,6]\n\nWait, the transformed rows here are:\n\nRow0 transformed: [6,9,9,9,9,6] (original row reversed is [9,9,6], appending gives 6,9,9,9,9,6). But the output's first row is [6,9,9,6,6,6]. So that doesn't match. So my previous assumption is wrong.\n\nSo perhaps the transformation isn't just appending the reversed row. There's something else going on here.\n\nLooking at example2's first input row [6,9,9]. The output row is [6,9,9,6,6,6]. The original row is 3 elements. The transformed row is 6 elements. So the first three elements are the original row. The next three elements are [6,6,6]. How is that determined?\n\nOriginal row starts with 6. The next three elements are three copies of 6. Maybe it's taking the first element of the row and repeating it three times. So for row0: first element is 6 \u2192 append 6,6,6. So transformed row is [6,9,9,6,6,6].\n\nRow1: [6,4,4]. First element is 6. Append three copies of 4? But the output is [6,4,4,4,4,9]. Wait, that's 6,4,4 followed by 4,4,9. So the appended part is 4,4,9. Hmm. Where does 9 come from?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the appended part is the reverse of the original row but with some modification. Original row is [6,4,4]. Reversed is [4,4,6]. So appending that would give [6,4,4,4,4,6]. But the output has [6,4,4,4,4,9]. So the last element is 9 instead of 6. That's strange. Where does the 9 come from? Maybe it's the first element of the next row. Row1 is followed by row2, which is [6,4,4]. First element is 6. No, that's not 9. Wait, maybe the last element of the previous row. Row0's last element is 9. But row1's transformed row is [6,4,4,4,4,9]. So the 9 here is from row0's last element. Hmm. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the appended part is the reverse of the original row but with the first element replaced by the first element of the next row. Let's see. Row0 is [6,9,9]. Next row is [6,4,4]. Reverse of row0 is [9,9,6]. If we replace the first element of the reversed row with the next row's first element (6), we get [6,9,6]. Appending that to row0 gives [6,9,9,6,9,6]. But the actual output is [6,9,9,6,6,6]. No, that doesn't fit.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Let's look for another approach.\n\nIn example0's output, each transformed row is the original row followed by reversed next row. Let's check.\n\nInput rows: [8,6] and [6,8].\n\nFirst transformed row is [8,6,6,8], which is row0 followed by reversed row1. Because row1 is [6,8], reversed is [8,6], so combining gives [8,6] + [8,6] \u2192 no, that's [8,6,8,6]. But the actual output is [8,6,6,8]. Oh wait, reversed row1 is [8,6], but they appended the original row1 [6,8]. Wait, no. Because row0 is [8,6], then they append row1 [6,8], which is the same as reversed row0? Wait, row0 reversed is [6,8]. So row0 followed by row1's original (which is [6,8]) gives [8,6,6,8]. So yes. Then row1's transformed row is [6,8,8,6], which is row1 [6,8] followed by row0 reversed [6,8] reversed is [8,6]. So [6,8] + [8,6] gives [6,8,8,6]. So the pattern here is each row is followed by the reversed version of the next row. But for the last row, the next row wraps around to the first row.\n\nWait, example0 has two rows. So row0 is followed by row1's reversed. Row1 is followed by row0's reversed. Then each transformed row is duplicated. So the output is row0 transformed, row1 transformed, each appearing twice. That explains example0's output.\n\nFor example1, input rows are three:\n\nRow0: [7,7,8]\n\nRow1: [7,7,8]\n\nRow2: [8,8,8]\n\nTransformed rows:\n\nRow0 transformed would be row0 followed by reversed row1 (since next row is row1). But row1 is [7,7,8], reversed is [8,7,7]. So row0 transformed is [7,7,8] + [8,7,7] \u2192 [7,7,8,8,7,7]. Then row1 transformed is row1 followed by reversed row2: row2 reversed is [8,8,8], so [7,7,8,8,8,8]. But the output's row1 transformed is [7,7,8,8,7,7]. Hmm, that's not matching. Wait, the output for example1 has rows:\n\n[7,7,8,8,7,7]\n\n[7,7,8,8,7,7]\n\n[8,8,8,8,8,8]\n\n[8,8,8,8,8,8]\n\n[7,7,8,8,7,7]\n\n[7,7,8,8,7,7]\n\nSo the first two rows are the same. The third and fourth are all 8s. Then fifth and sixth are same as first two. So maybe the transformed rows are row0 followed by reversed row0, row1 followed by reversed row1, etc. But that would give for row0: [7,7,8] reversed is [8,7,7], so combined [7,7,8,8,7,7], which matches. Then row1 is same as row0, so same transformed row. Row2 is [8,8,8], reversed is same, so transformed row is [8,8,8,8,8,8]. Then each transformed row is duplicated twice. So the output is row0 transformed (twice), row1 transformed (twice, same as row0), row2 transformed (twice). So that's 2+2+2=6 rows. That matches example1's output.\n\nSo this suggests that each transformed row is the original row followed by its own reverse. Then each transformed row is duplicated as many times as the number of rows in the input. Wait, example0 has two rows. Each transformed row is duplicated twice. So 2 duplicates per row, 2 rows \u2192 4 total. Example1 has three rows, each duplicated twice \u2192 6 rows. Example2's input has three rows. Let's check example2.\n\nExample2's input rows:\n\nRow0: [6,9,9]\n\nRow1: [6,4,4]\n\nRow2: [6,4,4]\n\nTransformed rows:\n\nRow0: [6,9,9] followed by reversed [9,9,6] \u2192 [6,9,9,9,9,6]. But the output's first row is [6,9,9,6,6,6]. So that's not matching. So my previous conclusion is incorrect.\n\nHmm. So perhaps the pattern is different. Let's look at example2's output again. First output row is [6,9,9,6,6,6]. Original row is [6,9,9]. The appended part is [6,6,6]. So maybe the first element of the row is repeated three times. So for each row, transformed row is original + [first element, first element, first element]. For example0's row0 [8,6], transformed would be [8,6,8,8], but example0's output is [8,6,6,8]. So that doesn't fit. Alternatively, maybe the first element and then some other pattern.\n\nLooking at example2's row1 transformed: [6,4,4,4,4,9]. Original row1 is [6,4,4]. The appended part is [4,4,9]. Where does 9 come from? The 9 is from row0's last element. So maybe each row is followed by a combination of the next row's elements. For example, row0's transformed is row0 followed by reversed row1. Let's check: row0 is [6,9,9], row1 is [6,4,4]. Reversed row1 is [4,4,6]. So row0 transformed would be [6,9,9,4,4,6]. But the actual output row is [6,9,9,6,6,6]. Doesn't match. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformed row is original row followed by the next row's elements in reverse. Let's see:\n\nRow0: [6,9,9] \u2192 next row is row1 [6,4,4]. Reversed row1 is [4,4,6]. Appending gives [6,9,9,4,4,6]. Not matching. Actual output row is [6,9,9,6,6,6]. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's the original row followed by the first element of the row, repeated three times. For row0, first element is 6 \u2192 [6,6,6], so transformed row is [6,9,9,6,6,6], which matches. For row1, first element is 6 \u2192 transformed row would be [6,4,4,6,6,6]. But the output row is [6,4,4,4,4,9]. So that doesn't fit. So that's not it.\n\nThis is getting really confusing. Let's look for another approach.\n\nLooking at example2's output, the last three rows are:\n\n[9,4,4,4,4,6]\n\n[9,4,4,4,4,6]\n\n[6,6,6,9,9,6]\n\nSo the third row starts with 9. Where does 9 come from? The input's first row is [6,4,4], and the third row in the output is [9,4,4,4,4,6]. The 9 might be from the first element of the first row of the input, which is 6. No. Alternatively, perhaps it's from the first row's last element, which is 9. So maybe each transformed row is a combination of elements from different rows.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is a combination of the original matrix and its transpose, or some other matrix operation. But I'm not sure.\n\nLooking at example2's output rows:\n\nRow0: [6,9,9,6,6,6]\n\nRow1: [6,4,4,4,4,9]\n\nRow2: [6,4,4,4,4,9]\n\nRow3: [9,4,4,4,4,6]\n\nRow4: [9,4,4,4,4,6]\n\nRow5: [6,6,6,9,9,6]\n\nObserving that rows 1 and 2 are the same, rows 3 and 4 are the same, rows0 and5 are similar but reversed. For example, row0 starts with 6,9,9 and ends with 6,6,6. Row5 starts with 6,6,6 and ends with 9,9,6. So it's like the original row0's transformed is row0 followed by three 6s, and row5 is three 6s followed by reversed row0. But why?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is a square matrix where the transformed rows are mirrored or arranged in a certain way. For example, in example0's output, the rows are arranged in a palindrome-like structure. For example, the first and last rows are the same, the middle two rows are the same. Similarly in example1, the first two and last two are the same.\n\nIn example2, the first row is [6,9,9,6,6,6], the last row is [6,6,6,9,9,6]. So it's reversed in some way.\n\nWait, maybe the output is constructed by taking the transformed rows and their reverse. For example, in example0's transformed rows:\n\nTransformed row0: [8,6,6,8]\n\nTransformed row1: [6,8,8,6]\n\nThen output is:\n\nrow0\n\nrow1\n\nrow1\n\nrow0\n\nBut that's not exactly. Example0's output is:\n\n[8,6,6,8]\n\n[6,8,8,6]\n\n[6,8,8,6]\n\n[8,6,6,8]\n\nSo it's row0, row1, row1, row0. Which is a mirror.\n\nSimilarly, example1's output is:\n\nrow0 transformed (twice), row2 transformed (twice), row0 transformed (twice). Because in example1's output, the first two rows are [7,7,8,8,7,7], then two rows of [8,8,8...], then again two rows of [7,7,8...]. But row2's transformed is [8,8,8,8,8,8]. So output is:\n\nrow0, row0, row2, row2, row0, row0.\n\nNot sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is a reflection of the input rows. For example, in example0, after transforming each row, the output is arranged as the transformed rows followed by the reversed transformed rows. So for example0, the output is:\n\nrow0 transformed, row1 transformed, row1 transformed reversed, row0 transformed reversed. But how?\n\nAlternatively, the output is a square matrix where each row is transformed and then mirrored. But I'm not making progress.\n\nLet's try to think differently. Let's look for the length of input rows and output rows. In example0, input rows are length 2, output rows are length 4 (double). Example1: input rows length 3, output rows length 6 (double). Example2: input rows length 3, output rows length 6. So each output row is double the input row length. So the transformation involves doubling the row length.\n\nIn example0: each row is followed by the reverse of the other row. Row0 is followed by reversed row1, row1 is followed by reversed row0.\n\nExample0's input rows:\n\nrow0: [8,6]\n\nrow1: [6,8]\n\ntransformed rows:\n\nrow0 transformed: row0 + reversed row1 \u2192 [8,6] + [8,6] \u2192 [8,6,8,6]? But the actual output is [8,6,6,8]. Wait, reversed row1 is [8,6], so appending that to row0 gives [8,6,8,6], but output row0 is [8,6,6,8]. Hmm, that's different. Oh wait, maybe reversed row1 is [6,8], so appending that gives [8,6,6,8]. But row1 is [6,8], reversed would be [8,6]. Wait, no. Reversing [6,8] would be [8,6]. So appending that to row0 gives [8,6,8,6]. But the output row is [8,6,6,8]. So that's not matching.\n\nWait example0's output first row is [8,6,6,8]. Which is row0 followed by row1. Because row1 is [6,8]. So row0 + row1 gives [8,6,6,8]. Then row1 transformed would be row1 + row0 reversed. Wait row0 reversed is [6,8], so row1 + row0 reversed is [6,8,6,8]. But output row1 is [6,8,8,6]. Hmm, not matching.\n\nAlternatively, row0 transformed is row0 followed by row1. So [8,6] + [6,8] = [8,6,6,8]. Then row1 transformed is row1 followed by row0. [6,8] + [8,6] = [6,8,8,6]. Then the output has row0 transformed, row1 transformed, row1 transformed again, row0 transformed again. That would give the four rows as per example0. So why are the rows duplicated? Because for each transformed row, we list it once, then again. So in example0, after transforming each row, they are listed twice. But in example0's output, the rows are:\n\nrow0 transformed \u2192 [8,6,6,8]\n\nrow1 transformed \u2192 [6,8,8,6]\n\nrow1 transformed \u2192 [6,8,8,6]\n\nrow0 transformed \u2192 [8,6,6,8]\n\nSo it's the transformed rows followed by their own reversed order. Wait, the first and last rows are the same. The second and third are the same. So the output is arranged as [t0, t1, t1, t0]. Which is a palindrome of the transformed rows. So the pattern is to take the transformed rows and mirror them.\n\nBut how about example1?\n\nExample1's transformed rows are:\n\nt0: [7,7,8,8,7,7]\n\nt1: [7,7,8,8,7,7] (since row1 is same as row0)\n\nt2: [8,8,8,8,8,8]\n\nSo output would be:\n\nt0, t1, t2, t2, t1, t0 \u2192 but the actual output is t0, t0, t2, t2, t0, t0. Because the first two are t0, next two are t2, then two t0 again. So this doesn't fit the palindrome idea.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is transformed rows followed by their reverse. For example0, transformed rows are [t0, t1], so mirrored is [t1, t0], making total four rows. But example1 has three transformed rows. Mirroring would give six rows: t0, t1, t2, t2, t1, t0. But example1's output is t0, t0, t2, t2, t0, t0. Which suggests that after transforming, each row is duplicated twice and arranged in a certain order.\n\nThis is getting too confusing. Let's try to look for another approach.\n\nLooking at example2's input:\n\nRow0: [6,9,9]\n\nRow1: [6,4,4]\n\nRow2: [6,4,4]\n\nOutput rows:\n\n[6,9,9,6,6,6]\n\n[6,4,4,4,4,9]\n\n[6,4,4,4,4,9]\n\n[9,4,4,4,4,6]\n\n[9,4,4,4,4,6]\n\n[6,6,6,9,9,6]\n\nNoticing that the first part of each output row is the input row, and the second part seems to be a modified version of another row.\n\nFor example, the first output row's second half is [6,6,6], which matches the first element of the row (6) repeated three times. The second output row's second half is [4,4,9], which is the first element of row1 (6) not matching. Wait, row1's first element is 6. But the second half is [4,4,9]. That's the last two elements of row1 (4,4) and then 9 from row0's last element. Or maybe it's the next row's elements.\n\nRow1's transformed row is [6,4,4,4,4,9]. So the second half is [4,4,9]. Where does the 9 come from? The last element of row0 is 9. So maybe each row's transformed second half is a combination of elements from other rows.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each transformed row is formed by taking the original row and appending the reversed row of the previous input row. Let's see:\n\nRow0 transformed: [6,9,9] + reversed row2 (since previous of row0 is row2 in a circular way?) Input rows are row0, row1, row2. So reversed row2 is [4,4,6]. So appending to row0 gives [6,9,9,4,4,6], but the actual output is [6,9,9,6,6,6]. Doesn't match.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the second half is the reversed row of the next input row. For row0, next row is row1. Reversed row1 is [4,4,6]. Appending to row0 gives [6,9,9,4,4,6], which doesn't match. So that's not it.\n\nAnother angle: the output's rows are all the transformed rows followed by their reversed versions. For example, in example0, the output is:\n\n[8,6,6,8] \u2192 t0\n\n[6,8,8,6] \u2192 t1\n\n[6,8,8,6] \u2192 reversed t1 is [6,8,8,6] same as t1\n\n[8,6,6,8] \u2192 reversed t0 is same as t0.\n\nBut not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the output is created by taking each transformed row and its mirror. So for each transformed row, you have it and its reverse in the output. Let's check example0:\n\nt0: [8,6,6,8] \u2192 reversed is [8,6,6,8] (same as t0)\n\nt1: [6,8,8,6] \u2192 reversed is same as t1. So output would be [t0, t1, t1, t0], which matches.\n\nExample1's transformed rows are:\n\nt0: [7,7,8,8,7,7] \u2192 reversed is same as t0.\n\nt1: same as t0.\n\nt2: [8,8,8,8,8,8] \u2192 reversed is same.\n\nSo output would be [t0, t1, t2, t2, t1, t0]. But example1's output is [t0, t0, t2, t2, t0, t0], which doesn't fit. So this idea is incorrect.\n\nHmm. This is really challenging. Let's try to look for another pattern.\n\nLooking at example2's output, the first row is [6,9,9,6,6,6]. The first three elements are the original row0. The next three elements are 6,6,6. So perhaps for each row, the first three elements are the original row, and the next three are the first element of the row repeated three times. For row0, first element is 6 \u2192 6,6,6. For row1, first element is 6 \u2192 but the second half is 4,4,9. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, the next three elements are the reverse of the original row. Original row0 is [6,9,9], reversed is [9,9,6]. But the next three elements are 6,6,6. Not matching.\n\nAlternatively, the next three elements are the reverse of the original row's elements but each element is replaced by the first element of the row. So for row0, reversed is [9,9,6], but replaced with 6 \u2192 [6,6,6]. That fits. For row1, original row is [6,4,4]. Reversed is [4,4,6]. Replace each element with 6 \u2192 [6,6,6], but the actual next three elements are [4,4,9]. So this doesn't work.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps the next three elements are the reverse of the next row's elements. For row0, next row is row1 [6,4,4]. Reversed row1 is [4,4,6]. So appending gives [6,9,9,4,4,6], which doesn't match output.\n\nAlternatively, the next three elements are the next row's elements in reverse order. For row0, next row is row1 [6,4,4], reversed is [4,4,6]. So appending gives [6,9,9,4,4,6]. Actual output is [6,9,9,6,6,6]. Doesn't match.\n\nHmm. Let's think about the test input:\n\nTest Input:\n\n[1,4,1]\n\n[4,9,4]\n\n[9,1,9]\n\nExpected to apply the pattern and give the output. Let's see. The input has three rows, so output will have six rows. Each input row is transformed in some way and duplicated twice.\n\nAssuming the transformation for each row is original followed by reversed row. Then each transformed row is duplicated twice.\n\nSo for row0: [1,4,1] \u2192 reversed is [1,4,1]. So transformed row is [1,4,1,1,4,1]. Duplicated twice.\n\nRow1: [4,9,4] \u2192 reversed is [4,9,4]. Transformed row is [4,9,4,4,9,4]. Duplicated twice.\n\nRow2: [9,1,9] \u2192 reversed is [9,1,9]. Transformed row is [9,1,9,9,1,9]. Duplicated twice.\n\nBut according to example2's input and output, this pattern doesn't fit. Because in example2, the transformed rows are different. So this approach is likely incorrect.\n\nAnother approach: perhaps the transformation is to mirror the original row and then append the mirror. For example, for row0 in example0: [8,6] \u2192 mirror is [6,8], so combined [8,6,6,8]. Which matches example0's output. Similarly, row1 [6,8] becomes [6,8,8,6]. So this works for example0. Then each transformed row is duplicated twice. So the output for example0 would be four rows: two copies of each transformed row. But example0's output is four rows arranged as [t0, t1, t1, t0], which doesn't fit.\n\nBut let's see example1. Row0 is [7,7,8]. Mirror is [8,7,7]. So transformed row is [7,7,8,8,7,7]. Duplicated twice. Row1 is same as row0, so same transformed row. Row2 is [8,8,8], mirror is same. So transformed row is [8,8,8,8,8,8], duplicated twice. So the output would be six rows: two of row0's transformed, two of row1's transformed (same as row0), two of row2's transformed. So output would be:\n\n[7,7,8,8,7,7]\n\n[7,7,8,8,7,7]\n\n[7,7,8,8,7,7]\n\n[7,7,8,8,7,7]\n\n[8,8,8,8,8,8]\n\n[8,8,8,8,8,8]\n\nBut example1's actual output is:\n\n[7,7,8,8,7,7]\n\n[7,7,8,8,7,7]\n\n[8,8,8,8,8,8]\n\n[8,8,8,8,8,8]\n\n[7,7,8,8,7,7]\n\n[7,7,8,8,7,7]\n\nWhich is different. So the pattern isn't simply appending the mirror and duplicating twice. There's an ordering aspect here.\n\nMaybe the output is arranged such that the transformed rows are mirrored in the output. For example, in example0, the order is t0, t1, t1, t0. In example1, the order is t0, t0, t2, t2, t0, t0. Which suggests that the output is formed by taking the transformed rows and their mirror image, but with some repetition.\n\nThis is getting too time-consuming. Let's try to find a pattern that fits all examples.\n\nLooking at example2's output, the transformed rows seem to be:\n\nRow0 transformed: [6,9,9,6,6,6]\n\nRow1 transformed: [6,4,4,4,4,9]\n\nRow2 transformed: [6,4,4,4,4,9]\n\nRow3 transformed: [9,4,4,4,4,6]\n\nRow4 transformed: [9,4,4,4,4,6]\n\nRow5 transformed: [6,6,6,9,9,6]\n\nSo rows0 and5 are bookends, rows1 and2 are same, rows3 and4 are same.\n\nRow0's transformation is original row0 followed by three 6s. The first element of row0 is 6, so three 6s. So that's [6,9,9] + [6,6,6].\n\nRow1's transformation is [6,4,4] + [4,4,9]. The 4s are from the row1's elements, but the 9 is from row0's last element. So perhaps each row's transformation appends the next row's elements in some way.\n\nRow1's next row is row2 [6,4,4]. So appending row2's first two elements (6,4) and then row0's last element (9)? That would give 6,4,9. But the appended part is [4,4,9]. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, the appended part for row1 is row2's elements except the first, and then row0's last element. Row2 is [6,4,4], so elements except first are [4,4]. Add row0's last element 9. So [4,4,9]. Which matches the appended part of row1's transformed row.\n\nSimilarly, row2's transformed row is [6,4,4] + [4,4,9], same as row1. Then row3's transformed row is [9,4,4,4,4,6]. The first part is [9,4,4], which might be the reverse of row0's elements starting from the end. Or perhaps row3 is the transformed version of row0 but reversed.\n\nRow5's transformed row is [6,6,6,9,9,6]. Which is three 6s followed by row0's original elements [9,9,6]. So perhaps this is a mirror of row0's transformed row.\n\nThis suggests that each transformed row is formed by combining elements from the original row and elements from other rows in a specific pattern, possibly based on their position in the input matrix.\n\nBut this is getting too complex. Given the time constraints, perhaps the best approach is to proceed with the pattern observed in example0 and example1: each row is transformed by appending its reversed version, then each transformed row is duplicated twice, and the output is arranged in a mirrored fashion.\n\nApplying this to the test input:\n\nTest input rows:\n\nRow0: [1,4,1]\n\nRow1: [4,9,4]\n\nRow2: [9,1,9]\n\nTransformed rows:\n\nRow0 transformed: [1,4,1,1,4,1]\n\nRow1 transformed: [4,9,4,4,9,4]\n\nRow2 transformed: [9,1,9,9,1,9]\n\nThen, each transformed row is duplicated twice. So the output would be six rows:\n\nRow0 transformed twice, row1 transformed twice, row2 transformed twice.\n\nBut example1's output has a different arrangement. For example1, the transformed rows are t0, t0, t2, t2, t0, t0. So maybe the order is t0, t0, t1, t1, t2, t2, but that's not matching. Alternatively, it's mirrored.\n\nAlternatively, the output is arranged as transformed rows followed by their reversed order. So for three rows: t0, t1, t2, t2, t1, t0. But in example1, the output is t0, t0, t2, t2, t0, t0. Which doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, for each transformed row, we add it twice, then reverse the order of the transformed rows and add them again. For example, for three rows:\n\nt0, t0, t1, t1, t2, t2 \u2192 then reversed would be t2, t2, t1, t1, t0, t0. So the output would be t0, t0, t1, t1, t2, t2, t2, t2, t1, t1, t0, t0. But example1 has six rows, which is the same as the number of transformed rows times two. So for three transformed rows, six output rows. Which is the case in example1 and example2.\n\nBut in example1's output, the transformed rows are t0 (twice), t2 (twice), t0 (twice). So it's not a simple duplication. \n\nThis is getting me stuck. Given the time I'm spending, I need to make an educated guess based on the patterns I can see.\n\nLooking at the test input:\n\nTest input is:\n\nRow0: [1,4,1]\n\nRow1: [4,9,4]\n\nRow2: [9,1,9]\n\nIf I follow the example0 pattern, each row is followed by the reversed next row (with row2's next being row0). So for row0, appending reversed row1: row1 reversed is [4,9,4], so row0 transformed is [1,4,1,4,9,4]. But I'm not sure. If this is the case, then the transformed rows would be:\n\nrow0 transformed: [1,4,1] + [4,9,4] reversed \u2192 [4,9,4] reversed is [4,9,4], so [1,4,1,4,9,4]\n\nrow1 transformed: [4,9,4] + reversed row2 \u2192 reversed row2 is [9,1,9], so [4,9,4,9,1,9]\n\nrow2 transformed: [9,1,9] + reversed row0 \u2192 reversed row0 is [1,4,1], so [9,1,9,1,4,1]\n\nThen each transformed row is duplicated twice. So output would be:\n\n[1,4,1,4,9,4]\n\n[1,4,1,4,9,4]\n\n[4,9,4,9,1,9]\n\n[4,9,4,9,1,9]\n\n[9,1,9,1,4,1]\n\n[9,1,9,1,4,1]\n\nBut comparing this to example2's output, which has different patterns, this might not be correct. \n\nAlternatively, if each row is appended with its own reverse:\n\nrow0 transformed: [1,4,1,1,4,1]\n\nrow1 transformed: [4,9,4,4,9,4]\n\nrow2 transformed: [9,1,9,9,1,9]\n\nThen output would have each transformed row duplicated twice. So:\n\n[1,4,1,1,4,1]\n\n[1,4,1,1,4,1]\n\n[4,9,4,4,9,4]\n\n[4,9,4,4,9,4]\n\n[9,1,9,9,1,9]\n\n[9,1,9,9,1,9]\n\nBut example1's output has the third and fourth rows as [8,8,8,8,8,8], which is row2 transformed. So this seems plausible. \n\nBut example2's output doesn't fit this pattern. So perhaps this is the correct approach, and example2 is a more complex case.\n\nBut given the training examples, especially example0 and example1, the pattern seems to be appending the reverse of the same row and duplicating each transformed row twice.\n\nApplying that to the test input, the output would be:\n\n[1,4,1,1,4,1]\n\n[1,4,1,1,4,1]\n\n[4,9,4,4,9,4]\n\n[4,9,4,4,9,4]\n\n[9,1,9,9,1,9]\n\n[9,1,9,9,1,9]\n\nBut looking back at example2's first transformed row is [6,9,9,6,6,6], which doesn't follow this pattern. So perhaps this isn't the correct approach.\n\nAnother possibility: the transformation involves swapping elements in a certain way. For example, in example0, the transformed rows are created by taking the original row and then the reverse of the next row. Row0's next row is row1, reversed row1 is [8,6], so row0 becomes [8,6,6,8]. Row1's next row is row0, reversed row0 is [6,8], so row1 becomes [6,8,8,6]. Then each transformed row is duplicated twice. So the output is:\n\n[8,6,6,8]\n\n[6,8,8,6]\n\n[6,8,8,6]\n\n[8,6,6,8]\n\nWhich matches example0.\n\nApplying this to the test input:\n\nRow0's next row is row1. Reversed row1 is [4,9,4]. So row0 transformed is [1,4,1,4,9,4].\n\nRow1's next row is row2. Reversed row2 is [9,1,9]. So row1 transformed is [4,9,4,9,1,9].\n\nRow2's next row is row0 (assuming circular). Reversed row0 is [1,4,1]. So row2 transformed is [9,1,9,1,4,1].\n\nThen each transformed row is duplicated twice. So output would be:\n\n[1,4,1,4,9,4]\n\n[1,4,1,4,9,4]\n\n[4,9,4,9,1,9]\n\n[4,9,4,9,1,9]\n\n[9,1,9,1,4,1]\n\n[9,1,9,1,4,1]\n\nBut this doesn't match the example2's output structure. However, example2's input rows are different, so maybe it depends on the specific elements.\n\nBut given that this pattern fits example0 and example1, perhaps this is the correct approach. Therefore, applying this to the test input would give the above output.\n\nBut I'm not entirely sure. Another possibility is that the transformation involves some other element-wise operation, but without more examples, it's hard to be certain.\n\nConsidering the time I've spent and the need to provide an answer, I'll proceed with this approach."
