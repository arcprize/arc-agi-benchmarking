        "cot_1": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. So, looking at the training examples, each input is a list of three lists (rows), and the output is a larger list of six lists. The output seems to mirror or extend the input in some way.\n\nLet's start with Example 0. The input has three rows: [5,3,4], [3,4,5], [3,4,4]. The output has six rows. Looking at the first output row [5,3,4,4,3,5], it looks like the original first row followed by its reverse. Wait, the original first row is [5,3,4], reversing that gives [4,3,5], but the output is [5,3,4,4,3,5]. Oh wait, no. Wait, the original row is length 3, the output row is length 6. So maybe each element is mirrored. Let's see: 5,3,4 becomes 5,3,4 followed by 4,3,5. But the output is [5,3,4,4,3,5], which is the original plus reversed. Hmm, yes. The first three elements are the original, the next three are reversed. Wait, no. Because [5,3,4] reversed would be [4,3,5], but the output appends 4,3,5. So the first row of output is [5,3,4,4,3,5]. So each input row is transformed into a row that's the original followed by its reverse. But then why are there six output rows? Because each input row is generating two output rows? Let's check the example 0 output.\n\nOriginal input rows are three. Output has six rows. Let's see:\n\nLooking at the output:\n\nRow 0: [5,3,4,4,3,5] \u2014 original first row followed by its reverse.\n\nRow 1: [3,4,5,5,4,3] \u2014 original second row [3,4,5] followed by reverse [5,4,3].\n\nRow 2: [3,4,4,4,4,3] \u2014 original third row [3,4,4] followed by reverse [4,4,3]. Wait, no. Reverse of [3,4,4] is [4,4,3], so appending gives [3,4,4,4,4,3].\n\nThen rows 3-5 in the output are the same as rows 2,1,0. So the output is constructed by first taking each input row, appending its reverse, creating three rows. Then those same three rows are mirrored again but in reverse order. So for example 0, the first three output rows are the transformed input rows, and the next three are the reverse of those. Let's see:\n\nOriginal three rows transformed:\n\nRow0: transformed as original + reversed \u2192 row0 of output.\n\nRow1: transformed \u2192 row1 of output.\n\nRow2: transformed \u2192 row2 of output.\n\nThen rows3-5 are row2, row1, row0 of the transformed rows. So the output is a mirror of the transformed rows vertically. So the total output is a 6x6 grid, which is a combination of the original 3x3 grid expanded by mirroring both horizontally and vertically.\n\nWait, but each original row is length 3. When transformed, each becomes length 6. The output rows are all length 6. And the output has six rows, which is double the original 3 rows. So the process is: take each row, mirror it (original + reversed) to make a 6-element row. Then, mirror the entire array of rows. So first, create three mirrored rows, then add the reverse of those three rows (without reversing each row, but reversing the order of the rows). So in example0:\n\nTransformed rows:\n\nRow0: [5,3,4,4,3,5]\n\nRow1: [3,4,5,5,4,3]\n\nRow2: [3,4,4,4,4,3]\n\nThen the next three rows are the same as the transformed rows in reverse order. So row3 is row2 transformed, row4 is row1 transformed, row5 is row0 transformed. Wait, no. Looking at example0's output:\n\nRows3-5 are:\n\n[3,4,4,4,4,3]\n\n[3,4,5,5,4,3]\n\n[5,3,4,4,3,5]\n\nWhich is the same as row2, row1, row0. So the output is transformed_rows + transformed_rows[::-1]. So the full output is the transformed rows followed by the reversed list of transformed rows. That makes the output have 6 rows (3 original transformed, 3 reversed order transformed).\n\nSo the pattern is:\n\nFor each input row, create a new row by appending its reverse. Then, take all those transformed rows and mirror them vertically (i.e., add them in reverse order) to form the lower half.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. For each row in the input, create a new row by taking the original elements and appending the reversed elements. Wait, no. Wait, in example0's first input row [5,3,4], the transformed row is [5,3,4,4,3,5]. The original elements are [5,3,4], then followed by [4,3,5]. Which is the reverse of the original row. So each row is transformed into original + reversed(original). So the length doubles from 3 to 6.\n\n2. Then, arrange these transformed rows in the output, followed by the reverse of these transformed rows. So the output has 6 rows: first the three transformed rows, then the same three in reverse order. For example0, the transformed rows are in order row0, row1, row2. Then rows3-5 are row2, row1, row0.\n\nSo applying this to the test input:\n\nTest input is three rows:\n\n[1,6,6]\n\n[5,2,2]\n\n[2,2,2]\n\nFirst step: transform each row by appending its reverse.\n\nFor the first row [1,6,6], reversed is [6,6,1]. So transformed row is [1,6,6,6,6,1].\n\nSecond row [5,2,2] reversed is [2,2,5], so transformed row is [5,2,2,2,2,5].\n\nThird row [2,2,2] reversed is [2,2,2], so transformed is [2,2,2,2,2,2].\n\nThese three transformed rows are the first three rows of the output.\n\nThen, the next three rows are these transformed rows in reverse order. So the third transformed row is [2,2,2,2,2,2], then the second transformed row [5,2,2,2,2,5], then the first transformed row [1,6,6,6,6,1].\n\nSo the full output should be:\n\nRow0: [1,6,6,6,6,1]\n\nRow1: [5,2,2,2,2,5]\n\nRow2: [2,2,2,2,2,2]\n\nRow3: [2,2,2,2,2,2]\n\nRow4: [5,2,2,2,2,5]\n\nRow5: [1,6,6,6,6,1]\n\nLooking at the training examples, like example3's output, which has the same structure. So applying this pattern to the test input should give the correct output.",

        "cot_2": "Okay, let's tackle this puzzle. So, the task is to figure out the pattern that transforms the input arrays into the output arrays based on the training examples. Then apply that pattern to the test input. Let me start by looking at the examples closely.\n\nLooking at Example 0:\n\nInput:\n[5,3,4]\n[3,4,5]\n[3,4,4]\n\nOutput is a 6x6 grid. Let me see each row of the output.\n\nThe first output row is [5,3,4,4,3,5]. Wait, that looks like the original input row [5,3,4] followed by its reverse [4,3,5], but reversed in a certain way. Wait, original is [5,3,4], reversed would be [4,3,5]. So concatenating the original and reversed gives [5,3,4,4,3,5]. Oh right, that's the first row.\n\nSimilarly, the second input row is [3,4,5], reversed is [5,4,3], so the second output row is [3,4,5,5,4,3]. The same pattern here.\n\nThird input row [3,4,4] becomes [3,4,4,4,4,3]. Wait, reversing [3,4,4] would be [4,4,3], so concatenating gives [3,4,4,4,4,3]. Yeah, same pattern.\n\nThen the next three rows of the output seem to mirror the first three. Let's see:\n\nThe fourth output row is [3,4,5,5,4,3], which is the same as the second row. Then fifth row is [5,3,4,4,3,5], same as first. So the output is structured as the original three rows followed by their mirrored counterparts in reverse order. Like, rows 0,1,2, then 2 mirrored, 1 mirrored, 0 mirrored? Wait, no. Let me check:\n\nIn example 0's output, the rows are:\n\nRow 0: [5,3,4,4,3,5] (original first input row concatenated with reversed)\nRow 1: [3,4,5,5,4,3] (second input row concatenated with reversed)\nRow 2: [3,4,4,4,4,3] (third input row concatenated with reversed)\nRow 3: same as row 2\nRow 4: same as row 1\nRow 5: same as row 0\n\nSo the output is a 6x6 matrix where the first three rows are each input row followed by its reverse (without the middle element?), then the next three rows are the same as the first three but in reverse order. Wait, no. Wait, the first three rows of the output are each input row concatenated with its reversed version. Then rows 3-5 are the same as rows 2-0, but each row is reversed? Or perhaps, each of the next three rows is the mirror of the first three. Let me check:\n\nLooking at the output of example 0:\n\nRow 0: [5,3,4,4,3,5]\nRow 1: [3,4,5,5,4,3]\nRow 2: [3,4,4,4,4,3]\nRow 3: [3,4,4,4,4,3]\nRow 4: [3,4,5,5,4,3]\nRow 5: [5,3,4,4,3,5]\n\nSo rows 3 is same as row 2, row4 same as row1, row5 same as row0. So the output is symmetric vertically. So the first three rows are the input rows each concatenated with their reversed, then the next three rows are the same as the first three but in reverse order (i.e., row3 is row2, row4 is row1, row5 is row0). So the entire output is a mirror image along the middle. So for 6 rows, the first three are original, then the next three are the first three in reverse order.\n\nSo the transformation for each input row is to take the original row and append its reversed version. Then, the output array is the combination of these transformed rows followed by the same transformed rows in reverse order (so the entire output is a square matrix with a vertical and horizontal symmetry).\n\nWait, let's check another example to confirm.\n\nTake Example 1:\n\nInput rows:\n[7,1,5], [7,7,1], [5,3,1]\n\nOutput rows:\n\nRow0: [7,1,5,5,1,7] (original row plus reversed)\nRow1: [7,7,1,1,7,7]\nRow2: [5,3,1,1,3,5]\nRow3: same as row2\nRow4: same as row1\nRow5: same as row0\n\nYes, same pattern. So each input row is transformed by appending its reversed version to create a 6-element array. Then, the output is constructed by taking these three transformed rows, then repeating them in reverse order (so row0, row1, row2, row2, row1, row0). Wait no: in example0, the first three rows are row0, row1, row2, then the next three rows are row2, row1, row0. So the output is the transformed rows followed by the transformed rows in reverse order, creating a 6-row matrix.\n\nSo the pattern is:\n\n1. For each input row (which has 3 elements), create a new row by concatenating it with its reversed version. So [a,b,c] becomes [a,b,c,c,b,a]? Wait wait, original input row is 3 elements. So when reversed, it's [c,b,a]. Then concatenating the original and reversed gives a 6-element array. Wait, but in Example0:\n\nOriginal row [5,3,4]. Reversed is [4,3,5]. So concatenating gives [5,3,4,4,3,5]. Yes, that's the first output row.\n\nSimilarly, for the third input row in Example0: [3,4,4], reversed is [4,4,3]. Concatenated gives [3,4,4,4,4,3]. So each input row becomes a 6-element array by original + reversed.\n\nThen, the output matrix is a 6x6 array. How is it constructed?\n\nIn the training examples, the output has 6 rows, each of 6 elements. The first three rows are the transformed input rows (each input row transformed into a 6-element array as described). Then the next three rows are the same transformed rows but in reverse order. For example, in example0, the fourth row is row2 (third transformed row), fifth row is row1, sixth row is row0. So the output is:\n\ntransformed_row0\ntransformed_row1\ntransformed_row2\ntransformed_row2\ntransformed_row1\ntransformed_row0\n\nWait, looking at example0's output rows:\n\nRow3: [3,4,4,4,4,3] which is transformed_row2\nRow4: [3,4,5,5,4,3] which is transformed_row1\nRow5: [5,3,4,4,3,5] which is transformed_row0\n\nSo yes, after the first three transformed rows, the next three are transformed_row2, transformed_row1, transformed_row0. So the output is:\n\nRow0: transformed_row0\nRow1: transformed_row1\nRow2: transformed_row2\nRow3: transformed_row2 again\nRow4: transformed_row1 again\nRow5: transformed_row0 again\n\nWait, no. In example0, the first three rows are transformed_row0, transformed_row1, transformed_row2. Then rows 3-5 are transformed_row2, transformed_row1, transformed_row0. So the output is:\n\ntransformed_row0\ntransformed_row1\ntransformed_row2\ntransformed_row2 (same as row2)\ntransformed_row1 (same as row1)\ntransformed_row0 (same as row0)\n\nWhich creates a symmetric structure. So the entire output is a combination of the transformed rows followed by the same rows in reverse order, creating a mirror image. Thus, the output matrix has 6 rows, where the first three are the transformed input rows, and the last three are those transformed rows in reverse order. So rows 3 is same as row2, row4 same as row1, row5 same as row0.\n\nSo the steps to create the output are:\n\n1. For each of the three input rows, create a transformed row by concatenating the original row with its reversed version, resulting in a 6-element row.\n\n2. The output matrix consists of these three transformed rows, followed by the same three transformed rows in reverse order (i.e., row2, row1, row0).\n\nNow, applying this to the test input.\n\nTest Input:\n\n[1,6,6]\n[5,2,2]\n[2,2,2]\n\nSo first, transform each input row.\n\nFirst input row: [1,6,6]. Reversed is [6,6,1]. Concatenated gives [1,6,6,6,6,1].\n\nSecond input row: [5,2,2]. Reversed is [2,2,5]. Concatenated gives [5,2,2,2,2,5].\n\nThird input row: [2,2,2]. Reversed is [2,2,2]. Concatenated gives [2,2,2,2,2,2].\n\nSo transformed rows are:\n\nRow0: [1,6,6,6,6,1]\n\nRow1: [5,2,2,2,2,5]\n\nRow2: [2,2,2,2,2,2]\n\nThen, the output matrix should be:\n\nRow0: [1,6,6,6,6,1]\n\nRow1: [5,2,2,2,2,5]\n\nRow2: [2,2,2,2,2,2]\n\nRow3: [2,2,2,2,2,2] (same as row2)\n\nRow4: [5,2,2,2,2,5] (same as row1)\n\nRow5: [1,6,6,6,6,1] (same as row0)\n\nSo the output is these six rows in order."
