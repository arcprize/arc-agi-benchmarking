        "cot_1": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. So, looking at the training examples, each input is a matrix, and the output is another matrix. The goal is to determine how the input is transformed into the output.\n\nStarting with Example 0. The input matrix is:\n\n[5, 0, 0]\n[3, 5, 0]\n[0, 0, 5]\n\nAnd the output is:\n\n[5, 3, 0]\n[0, 5, 0]\n[0, 0, 5]\n\nHmm, I notice that the diagonal elements (5,5,5) remain the same. The other elements seem to be moved. For instance, the 3 in the second row first column of the input moves to the first row second column in the output. So maybe there's a transpose happening here, but only for elements that are not on the main diagonal?\n\nWait, let's check Example 1. The input is:\n\n[5,0,0,0]\n[0,5,0,0]\n[6,0,5,0]\n[6,0,4,5]\n\nThe output is:\n\n[5,0,6,6]\n[0,5,0,0]\n[0,0,5,4]\n[0,0,0,5]\n\nLooking at the input, the third row first element is 6, which in the output is in the first row third column. Similarly, the fourth row first element is 6, which moves to first row fourth column. The fourth row third element is 4, which moves to third row fourth column. So it seems like for each element not on the diagonal, its position is swapped with its mirror across the diagonal. But only if it's above or below the diagonal? Wait, in Example 0, the 3 was in (2,1) and moved to (1,2). So yes, it's a transpose of the non-diagonal elements.\n\nSo the transformation is transposing the matrix, but keeping the diagonal elements in place. Wait, but in Example 0, the original diagonal elements are 5,5,5, and in the output they stay. The other elements are transposed. So the pattern is: transpose the entire matrix, but keep the main diagonal as is.\n\nWait, let me verify. Example 1's input, when transposed normally, would look like:\n\n5 0 6 6\n0 5 0 0\n0 0 5 4\n0 0 0 5\n\nWhich matches the output exactly. But the original input's third row first column is 6, which becomes first row third column. So yes, the entire matrix is transposed except the diagonals? Wait, no. Wait, in a normal transpose, the diagonals remain the same. Wait, no. Wait, if you transpose a matrix, the diagonal elements (if the matrix is square) stay in their positions. But in Example 0, the input matrix is:\n\nRow 0: [5,0,0]\n\nRow 1: [3,5,0]\n\nRow 2: [0,0,5]\n\nTransposing it would result in:\n\n[5,3,0]\n\n[0,5,0]\n\n[0,0,5]\n\nWhich is exactly the output of Example 0. So maybe the pattern is simply transposing the matrix. But why does that work? Let's check Example 1. The input matrix is:\n\nRow 0: [5,0,0,0]\n\nRow 1: [0,5,0,0]\n\nRow 2: [6,0,5,0]\n\nRow 3: [6,0,4,5]\n\nTransposing this would give:\n\nColumns become rows:\n\nFirst row (original columns of row 0): 5,0,6,6\n\nSecond row (original columns of row 1): 0,5,0,0\n\nThird row (original columns of row 2): 0,0,5,4\n\nFourth row (original columns of row 3): 0,0,0,5\n\nWhich matches the output of Example 1. Similarly, Example 2's input is:\n\n[5,0,0,0,0]\n[0,5,0,0,0]\n[8,8,5,0,0]\n[0,2,0,5,0]\n[0,2,0,1,5]\n\nTransposing this gives:\n\nRow 0: 5,0,8,0,0\n\nRow 1:0,5,8,2,2\n\nRow 2:0,0,5,0,0\n\nRow 3:0,0,0,5,1\n\nRow 4:0,0,0,0,5\n\nWhich matches the output of Example 2. So the pattern is that the output is the transpose of the input matrix. That's it. So for each test input, we just need to transpose the matrix.\n\nWait, but why would the transpose be the answer? Let me check again. For example, in Example 0, the input is:\n\nOriginal:\n\nRow 0: [5,0,0]\n\nRow 1: [3,5,0]\n\nRow 2: [0,0,5]\n\nTransposed:\n\nColumns become rows, so row 0 becomes [5,3,0], row 1 becomes [0,5,0], row 2 [0,0,5], which is the output. So yes, the output is the transpose of the input matrix.\n\nSo the transformation is simply transposing the matrix. Then for the test input, we need to transpose it.\n\nLet's look at the test input:\n\nTest Input:\n\nRow 0: [5,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow 1: [0,5,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow 2: [3,3,5,0,0,0]\n\nRow 3: [0,0,0,5,0,0]\n\nRow 4: [2,0,8,8,5,0]\n\nRow 5: [2,0,6,0,0,5]\n\nTransposing this 6x6 matrix would result in each column becoming a row.\n\nSo the first column is 5,0,3,0,2,2. So row 0 of the output is [5,0,3,0,2,2].\n\nSecond column: 0,5,3,0,0,0 \u2192 row 1 [0,5,3,0,0,0]\n\nThird column: 0,0,5,0,8,6 \u2192 row 2 [0,0,5,0,8,6]\n\nFourth column:0,0,0,5,8,0 \u2192 row3 [0,0,0,5,8,0]\n\nFifth column:0,0,0,0,5,0 \u2192 row4 [0,0,0,0,5,0]\n\nSixth column:0,0,0,0,0,5 \u2192 row5 [0,0,0,0,0,5]\n\nWait, but let me write this step by step.\n\nOriginal rows (rows 0-5):\n\nRow0: [5,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow1: [0,5,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow2: [3,3,5,0,0,0]\n\nRow3: [0,0,0,5,0,0]\n\nRow4: [2,0,8,8,5,0]\n\nRow5: [2,0,6,0,0,5]\n\nTransposed would be:\n\nEach column becomes a row.\n\nColumn 0: 5 (from row0), 0 (row1), 3 (row2), 0 (row3), 2 (row4), 2 (row5) \u2192 [5,0,3,0,2,2] \u2192 but wait, the output rows in the examples have the same length as the input. So for the test input, which is a 6x6 matrix, the output should be a 6x6 matrix where each row is the corresponding column of the input.\n\nSo the transposed matrix would be:\n\nRow0: [5,0,3,0,2,2]\n\nRow1: [0,5,3,0,0,0]\n\nRow2: [0,0,5,0,8,6]\n\nRow3: [0,0,0,5,8,0]\n\nRow4: [0,0,0,0,5,0]\n\nRow5: [0,0,0,0,0,5]\n\nBut let me check the example outputs again to make sure. In example 1, the transposed matrix was exactly the output. So applying transpose here should be correct.\n\nSo the answer for the test input is the transposed matrix. Let me write that out.",

        "cot_2": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. Looking at the training examples, the input is a square matrix, and the output seems to be a transformed version of it. Let's start with Example 0.\n\nIn Example 0, the input is:\n\n[5, 0, 0]\n[3, 5, 0]\n[0, 0, 5]\n\nThe output is:\n\n[5, 3, 0]\n[0, 5, 0]\n[0, 0, 5]\n\nHmm, so what's changing here? The first row's second element becomes 3, which was originally in the second row's first element. Wait a second, maybe this is some kind of transposition? But transposing a matrix would swap rows and columns. Let's check:\n\nOriginal matrix (input) for Example 0:\n\nRow 0: 5,0,0\n\nRow 1:3,5,0\n\nRow 2:0,0,5\n\nTransposed would be:\n\nColumn 0:5,3,0 \u2192 becomes Row 0:5,3,0\n\nColumn 1:0,5,0 \u2192 Row 1:0,5,0\n\nColumn 2:0,0,5 \u2192 Row 2:0,0,5\n\nWhich matches the output exactly. So Example 0's output is the transpose of the input. But wait, let's check the other examples to see if this holds.\n\nLooking at Example 1:\n\nInput:\n\n[5,0,0,0]\n\n[0,5,0,0]\n\n[6,0,5,0]\n\n[6,0,4,5]\n\nTransposed would be:\n\nRow 0:5,0,6,6\n\nRow 1:0,5,0,0\n\nRow 2:0,0,5,4\n\nRow 3:0,0,0,5\n\nWhich matches the output. So transpose seems correct here. Similarly, Example 2's input when transposed gives the output.\n\nWait, but matrix transposition is a standard operation. So the pattern here is simply transposing the matrix. But let me make sure there's no other transformation. For instance, looking at Example 2:\n\nInput:\n\nRow 0:5,0,0,0,0\n\nRow 1:0,5,0,0,0\n\nRow 2:8,8,5,0,0\n\nRow 3:0,2,0,5,0\n\nRow 4:0,2,0,1,5\n\nTransposed:\n\nColumn 0:5,0,8,0,0 \u2192 Row 0:5,0,8,0,0\n\nColumn 1:0,5,8,2,2 \u2192 Row1:0,5,8,2,2\n\nColumn2:0,0,5,0,0 \u2192 Row2:0,0,5,0,0\n\nColumn3:0,0,0,5,1 \u2192 Row3:0,0,0,5,1\n\nColumn4:0,0,0,0,5 \u2192 Row4:0,0,0,0,5\n\nWhich matches the output. So all three examples are just transposes of the input matrix. Therefore, the pattern is that the output is the transpose of the input matrix.\n\nNow, applying this to the test input. The test input is a 6x6 matrix. Let's write out its transpose.\n\nTest Input:\n\nRow 0:5,0,0,0,0,0\n\nRow 1:0,5,0,0,0,0\n\nRow 2:3,3,5,0,0,0\n\nRow 3:0,0,0,5,0,0\n\nRow 4:2,0,8,8,5,0\n\nRow 5:2,0,6,0,0,5\n\nTransposing this would make each column into a row. Let's list the columns:\n\nColumn 0:5,0,3,0,2,2 \u2192 becomes new Row 0\n\nColumn 1:0,5,3,0,0,0 \u2192 new Row1\n\nColumn2:0,0,5,0,8,6 \u2192 new Row2\n\nColumn3:0,0,0,5,8,0 \u2192 new Row3\n\nColumn4:0,0,0,0,5,0 \u2192 new Row4\n\nColumn5:0,0,0,0,0,5 \u2192 new Row5\n\nSo the output should be:\n\n[5,0,3,0,2,2]\n\n[0,5,3,0,0,0]\n\n[0,0,5,0,8,6]\n\n[0,0,0,5,8,0]\n\n[0,0,0,0,5,0]\n\n[0,0,0,0,0,5]\n\nWait, but let me check that. Let's take each column from the original input and make them rows.\n\nOriginal columns:\n\nColumn 0: 5 (Row0), 0 (Row1),3 (Row2),0 (Row3),2 (Row4),2 (Row5) \u2192 so new Row0 is [5,0,3,0,2,2]\n\nColumn1:0 (Row0),5 (Row1),3 (Row2),0 (Row3),0 (Row4),0 (Row5) \u2192 new Row1: [0,5,3,0,0,0]\n\nColumn2:0 (Row0),0 (Row1),5 (Row2),0 (Row3),8 (Row4),6 (Row5) \u2192 new Row2: [0,0,5,0,8,6]\n\nColumn3:0 (Row0),0 (Row1),0 (Row2),5 (Row3),8 (Row4),0 (Row5) \u2192 new Row3: [0,0,0,5,8,0]\n\nColumn4:0 (Row0),0 (Row1),0 (Row2),0 (Row3),5 (Row4),0 (Row5) \u2192 new Row4: [0,0,0,0,5,0]\n\nColumn5:0 (Row0),0 (Row1),0 (Row2),0 (Row3),0 (Row4),5 (Row5) \u2192 new Row5: [0,0,0,0,0,5]\n\nSo yes, that's the transposed matrix. So the output should be as above. Let's check the formatting to make sure it's correct as per the examples."
