        "cot_1": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. So, looking at the training examples, each input is a list of lists (like a matrix), and the output is another list of lists. The output seems to have more rows than the input. Let me check the examples one by one to see if I can spot a pattern.\n\nStarting with Example 0:\nInput has 3 rows. The output has 5 rows. The first output row is [1, 2, 3]. Then the next rows have zeros replacing some elements. Wait, maybe it's related to the unique elements sorted in some way? Let's see. The input matrices are:\n\nFirst input matrix:\n[2,2,1]\n[2,3,1]\n[1,1,1]\n\nSo the elements are 1,2,3. The first output row is [1,2,3]. Then each subsequent row has the elements from the previous but some turn into zeros. The next rows are [1,2,0], then three [1,0,0], etc. Hmm. How does that relate to the input?\n\nWait, maybe the output is building a pyramid-like structure where each level has the elements from the previous level but with certain elements turned to zero. But how are they ordered?\n\nAnother angle: maybe the output is the unique elements sorted, then each subsequent row removes elements from the end, replacing them with zeros. Let's check.\n\nIn Example 0, the first output row is [1,2,3], sorted? Wait, the input elements are 1,2,3. So sorted ascending. Then the next rows start from the left and replace the rightmost elements with zeros. Wait, the second row is [1,2,0], third is [1,2,0], then [1,0,0], etc. But why does the third row also have [1,2,0]? Maybe it's based on the count of each element in the input.\n\nWait, let's look at Example 0's input again. The elements in the input matrix:\n\nFirst row: 2,2,1 \u2192 counts: 1:1, 2:2, 3:0\nSecond row: 2,3,1 \u2192 counts: 1:1, 2:1, 3:1\nThird row: 1,1,1 \u2192 1:3, others 0.\n\nWait maybe the output is the count of each element per level. But how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is the transpose of the input's rows stacked in a certain way. Let's see. The first output row in Example 0 is [1,2,3]. Let's check the input columns. Each column in the input:\n\nFirst column of input: 2,2,1 \u2192 elements are 2,2,1. If sorted, it's [1,2,2]. Not sure. The first output row is [1,2,3]. Maybe the unique elements sorted in ascending order. Then, the output rows are layers where each layer removes the last element, replacing it with zero, but perhaps the number of layers depends on the maximum frequency of any element.\n\nAlternatively, looking at Example 1:\n\nInput is 3 rows with 4 elements each. The output has 6 rows. The first output row is [4,2,1,3]. The elements in the input are 3,1,1,4; 2,2,2,4; 4,4,4,4. So unique elements are 1,2,3,4. Sorted would be 1,2,3,4, but the first output row is [4,2,1,3]. Hmm, not sorted. Wait, perhaps the order is determined by the frequency of the elements in the input. Let's calculate frequencies.\n\nIn Example 1's input:\n\nCount of each element:\n\n1 appears in first row twice, third row none. Total 2?\nWait no, the input rows are:\n\nRow 0: [3,1,1,4] \u2192 3:1, 1:2, 4:1\nRow 1: [2,2,2,4] \u2192 2:3, 4:1\nRow 2: [4,4,4,4] \u2192 4:4\n\nTotal counts across all rows:\n\n1: 2\n2:3\n3:1\n4:1+1+4=6.\n\nSo the elements are 1,2,3,4. The first output row is [4,2,1,3]. So ordered by their total counts in descending order. Let's check:\n\n4 has 6, 2 has 3, 1 has 2, 3 has 1. So sorted in descending order of frequency: 4,2,1,3. Which matches the first output row. Then the next rows have trailing elements turned to zero. Like the second row is [4,2,1,0], third [4,2,0,0], etc. So each subsequent row after the first turns the next element from the end to zero. The number of rows seems to be the count of the highest frequency. For example, in Example 0, the highest frequency is 3 (the element 1 appears 3 times in the third row?), wait let's check.\n\nWait in Example 0's input:\n\nRow 0: [2,2,1] \u2192 counts: 2:2, 1:1\nRow 1: [2,3,1] \u2192 2:1, 3:1, 1:1\nRow 2: [1,1,1] \u2192 1:3\nSo total counts for each element:\n\n1: 1 (row0) +1 (row1) +3 (row2) =5?\nWait no, perhaps per row, the elements' frequencies are considered. Or maybe the maximum frequency in any single row.\n\nWait, in Example 0's output has 5 rows. The first row is [1,2,3]. Let me check the maximum frequency in any row for each element. For element 1: row2 has 3. For element 2: row0 has 2. For element 3: row1 has 1. So the maximum frequencies are 3 for 1, 2 for 2, 1 for3. So sorted by these max frequencies in descending order: 1 (3), 2 (2), 3 (1). Which matches the first output row [1,2,3]. Then the number of rows in the output is the maximum of these max frequencies. For Example 0, the max is 3 (from element 1). But the output has 5 rows, which is more than 3. Hmm, that doesn't fit. Wait, maybe the number of rows is determined by the maximum frequency plus something.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the output rows, perhaps each level represents a step where the elements are kept based on their frequency. Like in Example 1, the first output row is all elements sorted by frequency. Then each next row removes the last element (replaces with zero), but the number of rows is equal to the highest frequency. For example, in Example 1, the highest frequency is 6 (element 4), but output has 6 rows. Wait, no, the output in Example 1 has 6 rows. The highest frequency for element 4 is 4 in row 2. Wait, no, in the input of Example 1, element 4 appears once in row 0, once in row1, and four times in row2. So the maximum frequency per row is 4 (row2 for 4). Then, the output has 6 rows. Hmm, this doesn't align. Alternatively, perhaps the number of rows is the number of elements in the first output row. For example, in Example 0, first output has 3 elements, output has 5 rows. Not sure.\n\nWait looking at the output structures:\n\nExample 0 output has 5 rows. The first row is length 3, same as the input's row length. Then each subsequent row is the same as the previous but with the rightmost non-zero element replaced by zero. For example:\n\nRow0: [1,2,3]\n\nRow1: [1,2,0]\n\nRow2: [1,2,0]\n\nRow3: [1,0,0]\n\nRow4: [1,0,0]\n\nWait, why are there two [1,2,0] and two [1,0,0]? That's inconsistent. Maybe there's another factor. Let's think about the input's structure. The input has 3 rows. The output has 5 rows. Hmm. Maybe the number of output rows is equal to the sum of the highest frequency per element. Or perhaps it's related to the number of times each element appears across all rows.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each output row corresponds to a \"layer\" where each element's presence is based on how many times it can be \"stacked\" from the input rows. For instance, if an element appears in multiple rows, each occurrence contributes to a layer. Maybe the output is built by stacking the elements vertically, with each layer removing elements that don't reach that height.\n\nWait, let's think of the input as layers. For example, in Example 0:\n\nInput rows:\nRow0: [2,2,1]\nRow1: [2,3,1]\nRow2: [1,1,1]\n\nIf we stack these rows, maybe the output is built by taking the unique elements sorted by their frequency in the stack. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's a frequency count per column.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by first collecting all unique elements from the input matrix, sorted in a particular order, then creating a pyramid where each subsequent row has one more zero from the right. The number of rows is determined by the maximum count of the elements in their respective rows.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the output rows, they seem to form a lower triangular matrix where each row after the first has an additional zero at the end, but with the elements ordered based on some priority. Let's take Example 0's output:\n\n[1,2,3]\n[1,2,0]\n[1,2,0]\n[1,0,0]\n[1,0,0]\n\nSo after the first row, each subsequent row replaces the last non-zero element with zero, but in some cases, the same row repeats. For example, the second and third rows are the same, then the fourth and fifth rows are the same. That suggests that there's a pattern where the zeros are added in steps, but perhaps the steps are determined by the maximum frequency of each element in the input.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the elements in the output are ordered based on the earliest row they appear in the input. For Example 0, the elements 2 and 1 are in the first row, 3 in the second. But the output order is 1,2,3, which is sorted. So maybe that's not the case.\n\nLet me check Example 2. Input:\n\n[8,8,2]\n[3,8,8]\n[3,3,4]\n[3,3,4]\n\nOutput:\n\n[3,8,4,2]\n[3,8,4,0]\n[3,8,0,0]\n[3,8,0,0]\n[3,0,0,0]\n\nThe elements in the input are 8,2,3,4. So the first output row is [3,8,4,2]. Let's check their frequencies per row.\n\nFor element 3: appears in row1 (1), row2 (2), row3 (2). So maximum frequency per row: 2 (rows 2 and 3). For 8: row0 (2), row1 (2), others 0. Max 2. For 4: rows2 and 3, each has 1. Max 1. For 2: only row0, 1. So if ordered by max frequency, descending, then 3 and 8 (both max 2), then 4 (max 1), then 2 (max 1). But the first output row is [3,8,4,2]. So maybe the order is first elements with higher max frequency, and then sorted in some way if there's a tie. Alternatively, the order could be based on the first occurrence of their maximum frequency. For example, 3 appears with max 2 in row2, and 8 also in row0. So perhaps elements with higher max frequencies come first, and among those with the same max frequency, the one that appears first in the input comes first.\n\nIn Example 0, the first output element is 1, which has a max frequency of 3 (in row2). Then 2 has max 2 (row0). So sorted by max frequency descending, then order in which they first achieved that max. So 1 (max 3), 2 (max 2), 3 (max 1). So first output row is [1,2,3].\n\nIn Example 1, first output row is [4,2,1,3]. Let's check their max frequencies. 4's max is 4 (row2), 2's max is 3 (row1), 1's max is 2 (row0), 3's max is 1 (row0). So order by max frequency descending: 4 (4), 2 (3), 1 (2), 3 (1). Which matches the first output row.\n\nIn Example 2, the first output row is [3,8,4,2]. Max frequencies: 3 has max 2 (rows2 and3), 8 has max 2 (rows0 and1), 4 has max 1 (rows2 and3), 2 has max 1 (row0). So 3 and 8 have the same max frequency. How are they ordered in the output? 3 comes first. Let's check which element first achieved their max frequency. For 3: in row2, which is the third row of input. For 8: first achieved max 2 in row0. So since 8 achieved their max earlier than 3, why is 3 first in the output? Hmm, that doesn't fit. Maybe there's another criterion when max frequencies are equal. Maybe the total count across all rows? For Example 2: 3 appears in rows1 (once), row2 (twice), row3 (twice) \u2192 total 5. 8 appears in row0 (twice), row1 (twice) \u2192 total 4. So 3 has higher total count, hence comes first. So when max frequencies are equal, the element with higher total count comes first. Then 8's total is 4, 3's is 5. So 3 comes first.\n\nSo the order in the first output row is sorted by max frequency descending, then by total count descending, then perhaps by their value or first occurrence. Let's verify.\n\nIn Example 3's input:\n\n[1,1,1]\n[2,2,1]\n[2,8,1]\n[2,8,1]\n\nElements: 1,2,8. Max frequencies per row:\n\n1: row0 (3), row1 (1), row2 (1), row3 (1) \u2192 max 3.\n\n2: row1 (2), row2 (1), row3 (1) \u2192 max 2.\n\n8: row2 (1), row3 (1) \u2192 max 1.\n\nSo first output row should be [1,2,8]. Which matches the first output row in Example 3. Then the next rows replace elements with zeros starting from the end. The output has 6 rows. Let's check why. The highest max frequency is 3 (for element 1). So maybe the number of output rows is equal to the highest max frequency. But in Example 3, highest max frequency is 3, but the output has 6 rows. Hmm, that doesn't fit. Alternatively, the number of rows is the sum of the first row's elements' max frequencies. Not sure.\n\nLooking at the output rows for Example 3:\n\n[1,2,8]\n[1,2,8]\n[1,2,0]\n[1,2,0]\n[1,0,0]\n[1,0,0]\n\nSo the first two rows are the same. Then two rows with [1,2,0], then two with [1,0,0]. So each \"step\" has two rows. Maybe this corresponds to the number of rows in the input. Example 3's input has 4 rows. Output has 6 rows. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the number of output rows is equal to the maximum number of times an element appears consecutively in the same position across the input rows. But this seems complicated.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each output row corresponds to a level in the input rows. For example, the first output row is the elements sorted by their max frequency, then each subsequent output row adds a zero from the right, but the number of times a row is repeated depends on the difference between the current element's max frequency and the next. This is getting a bit convoluted.\n\nLet me try to outline the steps I think are happening:\n\n1. Collect all unique elements from the input matrix.\n2. Sort them in descending order based on their maximum frequency in any single row of the input. If two elements have the same max frequency, sort them by their total count across all rows (descending), then perhaps by their value (descending) or first occurrence.\n3. The first output row is this sorted list of elements.\n4. The subsequent rows are generated by replacing the rightmost non-zero element with zero, one at a time. However, some rows repeat. The number of rows is determined by the sum of the max frequencies of the elements or some other measure.\n\nWait, in Example 0:\n\nFirst row has elements [1,2,3]. The max frequencies are 3 (1), 2 (2), 1 (3). The next rows are:\n\n[1,2,0] (replace 3 with 0)\n[1,2,0] again\n[1,0,0] (replace 2 with 0)\n[1,0,0] again\nSo each step down reduces the number of non-zero elements by one, but repeats some rows. The total rows here are 5. The sum of the max frequencies is 3+2+1=6, but 5 rows. Not matching.\n\nAnother approach: the number of output rows is the sum of the max frequencies minus something. Or it's the maximum row count of the input. Example 0's input has 3 rows, output has 5. Example 1's input has 3 rows, output has 6. Example 2's input has 4 rows, output has 5. Example 3's input has 4 rows, output has 6. So no direct relation.\n\nAlternatively, the output rows are structured such that each element's position in the first row corresponds to how many times it can \"stand\" in the column. For example, the first element in the first row (sorted by max frequency) has its max frequency as the number of times it appears in a row. Then, the number of rows it appears in the output is its max frequency, and subsequent elements are added with their own max frequencies, but if overlapping, perhaps the rows are extended.\n\nWait, let's think of each element as a tower with height equal to its max frequency. The output is a matrix where each row represents a level of the towers, starting from the top. For example, if element A has a max frequency of 3, element B has 2, element C has 1, then the output rows would be:\n\n[A, B, C]\n[A, B, 0]\n[A, 0, 0]\n[A, 0, 0]\n\nBut in Example 0, the max frequencies are 3 (1), 2 (2), 1 (3). So the output should have 3 rows for 1, 2 rows for 2, and 1 row for 3. But the output is 5 rows, which is 3 + 2 - 0? Not sure. Let's model it:\n\nFirst element (1) has max frequency 3. So in rows 1-3 of the output, the first element is present. Second element (2) has max frequency 2: present in rows 1-2. Third element (3) has 1: present in row 1.\n\nBut the output rows are:\n\n[1,2,3] \u2192 all present (level 1)\n[1,2,0] \u2192 3's level ends here (level 2)\n[1,2,0] \u2192 level 3 (but why is 2 still present here?)\nWait, maybe each element's presence in a row is determined by whether their max frequency is >= the current row number. So row 1: all elements present if their max >=1 (which they all are). Row 2: elements where max >=2. For element 3, max is 1, so replaced by 0. So output becomes [1,2,0]. Row 3: elements with max >=3. Only element 1 has max 3. So [1,0,0]. Row 4: same as row3. Row5: same. But why 5 rows? Because the highest max is 3, so 3 rows. But in Example 0, output has 5 rows. So this theory doesn't hold.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the number of rows is the sum of the max frequencies. For Example 0: 3+2+1=6. But output has 5 rows. Not matching.\n\nAlternatively, the output rows are determined by the maximum number of elements in any row of the input. For Example 0, each row has 3 elements. Output has 5 rows. Not directly related.\n\nLet me think differently. Perhaps each output row corresponds to the number of times an element appears in a column when the input is transposed. For example, the input is transposed, and each column becomes a row in the output, sorted by the count of each element in the column.\n\nWait, in Example 0's input:\n\nOriginal input rows:\n[2,2,1]\n[2,3,1]\n[1,1,1]\n\nTransposing gives columns:\n\nCol0: 2,2,1 \u2192 elements 2,2,1 \u2192 sorted maybe as 1,2,2. But output first row is [1,2,3]. Doesn't match.\n\nAlternatively, the output is built by taking the unique elements from each column, sorted, and stacking them. But not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the output is generated by considering each row of the input and stacking them, but ordered by some rule. Not sure.\n\nLet me look at the test input:\n\nTest Input:\n[8, 8, 2, 2]\n[1, 8, 8, 2]\n[1, 3, 3, 4]\n[1, 1, 1, 1]\n\nFirst, find the unique elements. They are 1, 2, 3, 4, 8.\n\nNow, compute the max frequency per row for each element:\n\nFor element 8:\n\nRow0: 2 times.\nRow1: 2 times.\nOthers: 0. So max frequency is 2.\n\nFor element 2:\n\nRow0: 2 times.\nRow1: 1 time.\nOthers: 0. Max 2.\n\nElement 1:\n\nRow3: 4 times.\nRow1: 1 time.\nRow2: 1 time. Max 4.\n\nElement 3:\n\nRow2: 2 times. Max 2.\n\nElement4:\n\nRow2:1. Max1.\n\nSo the max frequencies:\n\n1:4, 2:2, 3:2, 8:2,4:1.\n\nSorted by max frequency descending: 1 (4), then 2,3,8 (all 2), then4 (1).\n\nNow, when max frequencies are equal, how to order 2,3,8? Let's check their total counts across all rows.\n\nElement 2: row0 (2), row1 (1) \u2192 total 3.\n\nElement3: row2 (2) \u2192 total 2.\n\nElement8: row0 (2), row1 (2) \u2192 total4.\n\nSo among elements with max freq 2: 8 (total4),2 (3),3 (2). So order them 8,2,3. So the sorted list would be [1,8,2,3,4].\n\nWait, but wait. The elements with the same max frequency are ordered by their total counts in descending order. So 8 (4), then 2 (3), then 3 (2). So the first output row would be [1,8,2,3,4]? Wait but the test input has 4 elements per row, but the output rows should have the same length as the input rows. Wait the test input's rows have 4 elements each, so the output rows must have 4 elements. Wait, the test input has 4 columns. So the output rows will have 4 elements. So according to the pattern, the sorted elements by max frequency and total count would be [1,8,2,3], then 4 is omitted because we need 4 elements. Wait no, the test input's first row is [8,8,2,2], so there are 4 elements. So the unique elements are 1,2,3,4,8. But the first output row must have 4 elements. Hmm, this is a problem. Wait, perhaps the output rows have the same number of elements as the input rows. Let's check the training examples:\n\nExample0: input rows have 3 elements, output rows have 3 elements.\n\nExample1: input rows have 4 elements, output rows have 4 elements.\n\nExample2: input rows have 3 elements, output rows have 4 elements. Wait, the output rows in Example2 have 4 elements. Let's check:\n\nExample2's input has 3 elements per row, but the output rows have 4 elements. Wait, how is that possible?\n\nLooking back at Example2's input:\n\nInput:\n\n[8,8,2]\n\n[3,8,8]\n\n[3,3,4]\n\n[3,3,4]\n\nSo each row has 3 elements. The output rows have 4 elements, like [3,8,4,2]. So perhaps the output rows have as many elements as the maximum number of unique elements across all columns. Or perhaps the number of elements in the output rows is the number of unique elements in the input. In Example2, the unique elements are 8,2,3,4. Four elements. So the output rows have 4 elements. Wait, but the first output row is [3,8,4,2], which is four elements. So perhaps the first output row has all unique elements sorted by max frequency and total count, and the output rows have as many elements as there are unique elements, padded with zeros if needed. But in the test input's case, the unique elements are 1,2,3,4,8. Five elements. But the input rows have four elements each. So how does that fit?\n\nWait, this is conflicting. Let's check the training examples again. Example3's input:\n\nRows have 3 elements. Output rows have 3 elements. The unique elements are 1,2,8. So three elements, which matches the input row length. But in Example2's input, rows have 3 elements, but unique elements are 4 (3,8,4,2). So four unique elements. But the output rows have four elements, so perhaps the output rows are padded to the number of unique elements. So in the test case, even though the input rows have four elements, the unique elements are five (1,2,3,4,8), so the output rows would have five elements. But this contradicts the training examples. For example, Example1's input has 4 elements per row, and the output rows also have 4 elements, but the unique elements are four (1,2,3,4), so it fits. Example2's input has 3 elements per row, but four unique elements, so the output rows have four elements. So the number of elements in the output rows is equal to the number of unique elements in the input matrix. Thus, for the test input, which has five unique elements (1,2,3,4,8), the output rows should have five elements. But the test input's rows have four elements each. So perhaps the output rows are the unique elements sorted according to the rules, and then each row after that has trailing zeros. So for the test input, the first output row would be [1,8,2,3,4], then each subsequent row replaces the last element with zero until all are zero. But the training examples show that the output rows are the same length as the input rows. For example, Example2's input rows have 3 elements, but the output rows have 4 elements. So this theory is incorrect.\n\nWait, this is confusing. Let me re-examine Example2:\n\nExample2 input:\n\n[8,8,2]\n\n[3,8,8]\n\n[3,3,4]\n\n[3,3,4]\n\nUnique elements: 2,3,4,8 (four elements). So the output rows have four elements. So the output rows' length is equal to the number of unique elements. So for the test input, which has five unique elements, the output rows would have five elements each. But the test input's rows are four elements each. So this must be a different rule.\n\nAlternatively, the output rows have the same length as the input rows. For example, in Example2, the input rows are 3 elements, but output rows are 4 elements. So this can't be. Therefore, the output rows' length is equal to the number of unique elements in the input matrix. So, the number of elements in the output rows is equal to the number of unique elements, regardless of the input row length.\n\nBut then, in Example0, input has 3 elements per row, but three unique elements (1,2,3), so output rows have 3 elements. Example1 has 4 unique elements, output rows have 4 elements. Example2 has four unique elements, output rows have four. Example3 has three unique elements, output rows have three. So yes, the output rows' length equals the number of unique elements. Therefore, for the test input, which has five unique elements (1,2,3,4,8), each output row should have five elements.\n\nBut the test input's rows have four elements each. So how to handle that? The output rows would have five elements, but the input rows have four. This suggests that the output rows are not directly related to the input's row length but to the number of unique elements.\n\nSo, for the test input, first, list all unique elements, sorted by max frequency in any single row (descending), then by total count (descending), then maybe by value or order of appearance.\n\nSo for the test input:\n\nUnique elements: 1, 2, 3,4,8.\n\nMax frequencies:\n\n1:4 (row3)\n\n8:2 (row0, row1)\n\n2:2 (row0, row1)\n\n3:2 (row2)\n\n4:1 (row2)\n\nSo sorted by max frequency descending:\n\n1 (4), then 8 (2), 2 (2), 3 (2), 4 (1).\n\nFor elements with max frequency 2, order by total count:\n\n8: row0 (2) + row1 (2) =4.\n\n2: row0 (2) + row1 (1) + row3 (0) =3.\n\n3: row2 (2) =2.\n\nSo order is 8,2,3.\n\nSo sorted list is [1,8,2,3,4].\n\nThen the first output row is [1,8,2,3,4].\n\nThen each subsequent row replaces the last element with zero. So:\n\nRow0: [1,8,2,3,4]\n\nRow1: [1,8,2,3,0]\n\nRow2: [1,8,2,0,0]\n\nRow3: [1,8,0,0,0]\n\nRow4: [1,0,0,0,0]\n\nBut wait, in the training examples, the number of rows is determined by the highest max frequency plus something. For example, in Example0, highest max frequency is 3 (element 1), output has 5 rows. Example1's highest max is 4 (element4), output has 6 rows. Example3's highest max is 4 (element1), output has 6 rows. So the number of rows seems to be the highest max frequency plus the number of elements minus one. Or perhaps the number of rows is the highest max frequency plus the number of elements in the first output row minus 1.\n\nAlternatively, looking at Example0's highest max frequency is 3 (element1). Output has 5 rows. Which is 3 + 2 (number of elements -1=3-1=2, 3+2=5). Example1: highest max is 4 (element4), number of elements is4. 4+3=7, but output has 6 rows. Not matching.\n\nAlternatively, the number of rows is the sum of the max frequencies of the elements. For Example0: 3 (1) +2 (2) +1 (3) =6, but output has 5 rows. Not matching.\n\nAlternatively, the number of rows is the highest max frequency plus the number of elements in the first row minus 1. For Example0:3+3-1=5, which matches. Example1: highest max is 4, number of elements is4. 4+4-1=7. But output has6 rows. Doesn't match. Example3's highest max is4, elements 3. 4+3-1=6, which matches the output's 6 rows. Example2's highest max is2 (elements 3 and8), elements4. 2+4-1=5, which matches the output's5 rows. So this seems to fit.\n\nSo, the number of rows in the output is equal to (highest max frequency) + (number of elements in first row) -1.\n\nFor the test input:\n\nHighest max frequency is4 (element1).\n\nNumber of elements in first row is5 (unique elements:1,8,2,3,4).\n\nSo number of rows would be4+5-1=8. But in the training examples, this formula holds. For example:\n\nExample0:3+3-1=5 rows. Correct.\n\nExample1:4+4-1=7. But the output has6 rows. So this formula doesn't work for Example1. So perhaps this approach is incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, the number of rows is the highest max frequency multiplied by the number of elements. For Example0:3*3=9. No. Doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, the number of rows is the highest max frequency plus the number of elements minus 1. For Example0:3+3-1=5. Correct. Example1:4+4-1=7. Output has6 rows. Not correct. Example2:2+4-1=5. Correct. Example3:4+3-1=6. Correct. So this formula works for examples0,2,3 but not for example1. So what's different in example1?\n\nExample1's input:\n\n[3,1,1,4]\n\n[2,2,2,4]\n\n[4,4,4,4]\n\nUnique elements:1,2,3,4.\n\nHighest max frequency is4 (element4 in row2).\n\nNumber of elements is4.\n\nSo rows:4+4-1=7, but output has6 rows. So why discrepancy?\n\nLooking at Example1's output:\n\n[4,2,1,3]\n\n[4,2,1,0]\n\n[4,2,0,0]\n\n[4,0,0,0]\n\n[4,0,0,0]\n\n[4,0,0,0]\n\nSo 6 rows. According to the formula, it should be 4+4-1=7 rows. So this formula is invalid. So perhaps there's another rule.\n\nAnother observation: in Example1's output, after the first row, each row replaces the last non-zero element with a zero. The number of rows where the first element is present is equal to its max frequency. For example, element4 has max frequency4, so it appears in the first four rows, but in the output, the first element is4 in all six rows. So that theory is wrong.\n\nAnother possibility: the number of rows is the sum of the max frequencies of each element. For Example0:3+2+1=6. Output has5 rows. No. Not matching.\n\nAlternatively, the number of rows is determined by the highest max frequency plus the number of elements in the first row. For example0:3+3=6. Output5 rows. No.\n\nAlternatively, the number of rows is the highest max frequency multiplied by the number of elements. Example0:3*3=9. No.\n\nThis is getting too complicated. Let's focus on the test case and try to generate the output based on the observed patterns.\n\nTest Input:\n\nInput rows:\n\nRow0: [8,8,2,2]\n\nRow1: [1,8,8,2]\n\nRow2: [1,3,3,4]\n\nRow3: [1,1,1,1]\n\nUnique elements:1,2,3,4,8.\n\nMax frequencies:\n\n1:4 (row3)\n\n8:2 (row0 and row1)\n\n2:2 (row0 and row1)\n\n3:2 (row2)\n\n4:1 (row2)\n\nOrder of elements in first output row: sorted by max frequency descending, then by total count descending for ties. So:\n\n1 (4) \u2192 first.\n\nNext, elements with max frequency 2:8 (total4),2 (total3),3 (total2). So order 8,2,3.\n\nThen 4 (max1).\n\nSo first row: [1,8,2,3,4].\n\nNow, the number of output rows. Looking at previous examples, the number of rows seems to be the highest max frequency plus the number of elements in the first row minus 1. For the test case: highest max is4, elements5. 4+5-1=8. But in the training examples, example0 has highest max3, elements3: 3+3-1=5, which matches. Example2: highest max2, elements4: 2+4-1=5, which matches. Example3: highest max4, elements3:4+3-1=6, which matches. Example1: highest max4, elements4:4+4-1=7, but output has6 rows. So maybe there's an exception for when the highest max frequency is equal to the number of elements. Not sure.\n\nBut let's proceed. For the test case, we'll generate rows by replacing the last element with zero each time until all are zeros. The number of rows would be equal to the number of elements in the first row plus the highest max frequency minus 1. Alternatively, maybe the number of rows is the highest max frequency multiplied by the number of elements. But this is unclear.\n\nAlternatively, looking at example1's output, which has 6 rows for highest max4 and 4 elements. So 4+4-2=6. But this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, the number of rows is the highest max frequency plus the number of elements minus the number of times the highest max occurs. But this is not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the number of rows is the highest max frequency plus the number of elements in the first row minus the position of the highest max element in the first row. For example, in Example0, highest max element is1 which is first in the first row. So 3+3-1=5. Correct. In example1, highest max is4, first element in first row. So 4+4-1=7, but output is6. Doesn't fit.\n\nThis is getting too time-consuming. Perhaps the best approach is to proceed with the first part: arrange the unique elements in the first row sorted by max frequency and total counts, then each subsequent row replaces the last non-zero element with zero. Then, the number of rows is such that the first element (highest max frequency) has its max frequency determining the number of times it appears. For example, in Example0, the first element1 has max frequency3, so it appears in 3 rows. But output has5 rows. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, the number of rows is equal to the sum of the max frequencies. For example0,3+2+1=6. Output has5. Doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, the number of rows is equal to the highest max frequency multiplied by the number of elements. For example0:3*3=9. No.\n\nGiven that I'm stuck on the number of rows, perhaps I should look for another pattern. Looking at the output rows, they form a lower triangular matrix where each subsequent row has an additional zero at the end. For example, in Example0:\n\nRow0: all elements.\n\nRow1: last element zero.\n\nRow2: same as row1.\n\nRow3: last two elements zero.\n\nRow4: same as row3.\n\nThis seems inconsistent. Maybe the number of times a row is repeated depends on the difference between the current element's max frequency and the next. For example, in Example0, after the first row, the last element (3) has max frequency1, so it is only present in one row. Then the next element (2) has max frequency2, so it appears in two rows. Then element1 with max frequency3 appears in three rows. So rows would be:\n\n[1,2,3] \u2192 all present.\n\n[1,2,0] \u2192 3's max is1, so only one row.\n\n[1,2,0] \u2192 2's max is2, so two rows.\n\n[1,0,0] \u2192 2's max is2, so two rows. Wait, this doesn't align.\n\nAnother angle: perhaps the output is built such that each element's position in the first row is ordered by their max frequency and total count, and then each subsequent row removes one element from the end, replacing with zero. The number of times each row is repeated corresponds to the difference between the max frequency of the current element and the next.\n\nBut I'm not making progress. Let me try to generate the test case's output based on the observed patterns.\n\nFirst, the first row is [1,8,2,3,4].\n\nThen, each subsequent row replaces the last non-zero element with zero.\n\nRow0: [1,8,2,3,4]\n\nRow1: [1,8,2,3,0]\n\nRow2: [1,8,2,0,0]\n\nRow3: [1,8,0,0,0]\n\nRow4: [1,0,0,0,0]\n\nBut how many rows are there? Let's look at the highest max frequency, which is4 (element1). In Example3, the highest max frequency is4, and the output has6 rows. The test case's highest max is4, so maybe it has 4 + (5 elements -1) =8 rows? Or maybe the number of rows is the highest max frequency plus the number of elements minus 1. 4+5-1=8 rows. But in Example3, it's 4+3-1=6 rows. Which matches. Example0:3+3-1=5. So the test case would have 8 rows. But how to fill them.\n\nAlternatively, after reaching all zeros, the rows stop. For example, once all elements are zero except the first, which has max frequency4, so it should appear in 4 rows. Let's see:\n\nRow0: [1,8,2,3,4]\n\nRow1: [1,8,2,3,0]\n\nRow2: [1,8,2,0,0]\n\nRow3: [1,8,0,0,0]\n\nRow4: [1,8,0,0,0] (since 8's max is2, perhaps appears in 2 rows)\n\nRow5: [1,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow6: [1,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow7: [1,0,0,0,0]\n\nBut this is speculation. Alternatively, the number of times the first element appears is its max frequency. In the test case, element1's max frequency is4, so it appears in 4 rows. Then, the remaining elements are added until all are zeros. But in Example3, element1's max is4 and it appears in 6 rows, which is more than4. So this theory is incorrect.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and not reaching a definitive conclusion, I'll proceed with the following steps for the test case:\n\n1. Collect unique elements: 1,2,3,4,8.\n\n2. Compute max frequency per row for each element:\n\n1:4 (row3)\n\n8:2 (rows0,1)\n\n2:2 (rows0,1)\n\n3:2 (row2)\n\n4:1 (row2)\n\n3. Sort the elements in descending order of max frequency, then by total count:\n\nOrder: 1 (max4), 8 (total4), 2 (total3),3 (total2),4 (total1).\n\n4. First output row: [1,8,2,3,4].\n\n5. Subsequent rows are generated by replacing the last element with zero each step. Repeat until all elements except the first are zero, and the number of rows is such that the first element's max frequency is considered.\n\nBut in Example3, element1's max is4 and the output has6 rows. So the number of rows is the first element's max frequency plus the number of other elements. 4 +3-1=6. So for the test case, 4 +4=8 rows? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, in the output, the number of rows is equal to the first element's max frequency plus the number of elements minus 1. For test case:4+5-1=8 rows.\n\nSo, generating 8 rows:\n\nRow0: [1,8,2,3,4]\n\nRow1: [1,8,2,3,0]\n\nRow2: [1,8,2,0,0]\n\nRow3: [1,8,0,0,0]\n\nRow4: [1,8,0,0,0]\n\nRow5: [1,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow6: [1,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow7: [1,0,0,0,0]\n\nBut looking at the training examples, after the first element's max frequency is reached, the other elements may have their own. For example, in Example3, element1's max is4, but the output has6 rows. The first element appears in all6 rows, which is more than its max frequency.\n\nAlternatively, the number of rows is determined by the sum of the max frequencies of each element. For the test case:4 (1) +2 (8) +2 (2) +2 (3) +1 (4) =11. But this leads to too many rows.\n\nAt this point, given the time constraints, I'll proceed to generate the output based on the first part: order elements by max frequency and total count, then each row after replaces the last element with zero. The number of rows will be equal to the number of elements in the first row plus the highest max frequency minus 1. For the test case:5 elements +4-1=8 rows.\n\nBut looking at Example3, it has 3 elements and highest max4. 3+4-1=6 rows, which matches.\n\nSo for test case, 5 elements, highest max4. Rows=5+4-1=8. So generate 8 rows.\n\nThus, the output would be:\n\n[1,8,2,3,4]\n\n[1,8,2,3,0]\n\n[1,8,2,0,0]\n\n[1,8,0,0,0]\n\n[1,8,0,0,0]\n\n[1,0,0,0,0]\n\n[1,0,0,0,0]\n\n[1,0,0,0,0]\n\nBut this seems too long. However, looking at the training examples, like Example1 has output with 6 rows, which is (4 elements +4-1=7 rows) but output is6. So perhaps the formula is elements + highest max -1 minus 1. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the number of rows is the highest max frequency plus the number of elements minus1. For test case,4+5-1=8 rows.\n\nBut in Example1, 4+4-1=7, but output has6 rows. So perhaps there's another adjustment.\n\nAlternatively, the number of rows is the highest max frequency. But Example0's highest max is3, output has5 rows. No.\n\nGiven the uncertainty, perhaps the safest approach is to generate the output rows by replacing the last element with zero each time until all are zero, and the number of rows is the number of elements in the first row plus the highest max frequency minus1. So test case would have8 rows. But when I look at the training examples, they don't always follow this, but perhaps there's a mistake in my understanding.\n\nAlternatively, the number of rows is the highest max frequency plus the number of elements. For test case,4+5=9. Not matching.\n\nAlternatively, the number of rows is the highest max frequency multiplied by the number of elements. For test case,4*5=20, which is unreasonable.\n\nGiven that I'm stuck, I'll proceed with the initial pattern observed in the training examples: the first row is sorted by max frequency and total count, then each subsequent row replaces the last non-zero element with zero. The number of rows is determined by the highest max frequency plus the number of elements minus1.\n\nThus, the test case's output would have 8 rows. However, since the training examples don't perfectly follow this, perhaps the number of rows is determined by the highest max frequency. For example, in Example0, highest max is3, output has5 rows (3 +2). Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the number of rows is the sum of the first element's max frequency and the number of elements. For the test case,4+5=9. Not helpful.\n\nGiven that I'm time-constrained, I'll proceed to write the output for the test input as follows:\n\nFirst row: [1,8,2,3,4]\n\nThen each row after has the last element set to zero:\n\nRow1: [1,8,2,3,0]\n\nRow2: [1,8,2,0,0]\n\nRow3: [1,8,0,0,0]\n\nRow4: [1,8,0,0,0]\n\nRow5: [1,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow6: [1,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow7: [1,0,0,0,0]\n\nBut this would have8 rows. However, looking at the training examples, the number of rows seems to align with the highest max frequency plus the number of elements minus1. For example, in Example3, highest max4, elements3:4+3-1=6, which matches. For the test case,4+5-1=8 rows.\n\nBut the test input's rows have four elements, but the output rows have five elements each, which is possible. However, looking at the training examples like Example2, the input rows have3 elements, and output rows have4. So the output row length is the number of unique elements.\n\nThus, for the test case, the output rows should have five elements each, and the number of rows is8.\n\nBut given the training examples, perhaps the number of rows isn't strictly following a formula but is determined by the pattern of zeros added. For example, each time you add a zero to the end, and the number of rows is such that all elements except the first are zero, and the first element's max frequency determines how many times it appears.\n\nIn Example0's output, the first element1 appears in all5 rows, but its max frequency is3. So this theory is invalid.\n\nAt this point, I'll proceed to generate the output as follows, based on the first row being [1,8,2,3,4], then each subsequent row replaces the last non-zero element with zero, until all elements except the first are zero, and the number of rows is such that the first element's max frequency (4) is the number of rows where it appears. But in Example3's case, it's 4 max frequency but 6 rows, so this doesn't fit. So perhaps the number of rows is the first element's max frequency plus the number of elements minus1. So for test case,4+5-1=8 rows.\n\nThus, the final output would be:\n\n[1,8,2,3,4]\n\n[1,8,2,3,0]\n\n[1,8,2,0,0]\n\n[1,8,0,0,0]\n\n[1,8,0,0,0]\n\n[1,0,0,0,0]\n\n[1,0,0,0,0]\n\n[1,0,0,0,0]\n\nBut I need to check if this aligns with the training examples.\n\nLooking at Example3's output:\n\nFirst row: [1,2,8]\n\nNext rows:\n\n[1,2,8]\n\n[1,2,0]\n\n[1,2,0]\n\n[1,0,0]\n\n[1,0,0]\n\nSo the number of rows is6, which is the highest max frequency (4) for element1 plus the number of elements (3) minus1:4+3-1=6. Which matches.\n\nSimilarly, in Example0, highest max3, elements3:3+3-1=5 rows. Correct.\n\nIn Example1, highest max4, elements4:4+4-1=7 rows. But the output has6 rows. Hmm. So perhaps there's an exception. Maybe when the sum exceeds a certain value, it's capped. But without more data, it's hard to say.\n\nFor the test case, let's proceed with the formula of highest max + elements -1.\n\nThus, the test case's output would have 4+5-1=8 rows.\n\nBut when I look at the test input's rows, it's possible that the output needs to be padded to match the input's row count. But the test input has4 rows. So maybe the number of output rows is4. But the training examples have outputs with more rows than inputs.\n\nAlternatively, the number of output rows is the sum of the max frequencies of all elements. For test case:4 (1) +2 (8) +2 (2) +2 (3) +1 (4)=11 rows. This seems too many.\n\nGiven the uncertainty, I think the best approach is to generate the output rows by replacing the last element with zero each time, until all elements except the first are zero, and the number of rows is the number of elements plus the highest max frequency minus1.\n\nThus, the test case's output would be:\n\n[1,8,2,3,4]\n\n[1,8,2,3,0]\n\n[1,8,2,0,0]\n\n[1,8,0,0,0]\n\n[1,8,0,0,0]\n\n[1,0,0,0,0]\n\n[1,0,0,0,0]\n\n[1,0,0,0,0]\n\nBut looking at Example2's output:\n\n[3,8,4,2]\n\n[3,8,4,0]\n\n[3,8,0,0]\n\n[3,8,0,0]\n\n[3,0,0,0]\n\nWhich has5 rows. Highest max is2, elements4. 2+4-1=5. Correct.\n\nSo the test case should have8 rows. However, in the test input's case, the first element's max frequency is4, so perhaps the number of rows is4+5-1=8.\n\nBut in the training example1, highest max is4, elements4, but output has6 rows. 4+4-1=7, but output has6. So there's a discrepancy.\n\nPerhaps the formula is highest max + (number of elements -1). For test case:4 + (5-1)=8. For example1:4+3=7. Output has6. Doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, the number of rows is the highest max frequency plus the number of elements minus the number of elements with the highest max. For test case,4 +5-1=8. For example1:4+4-1=7. Output has6. Still discrepancy.\n\nAt this point, I'll proceed with the initial pattern and generate the output as follows, even if it doesn't perfectly match all training examples. The important part is the order of elements and the replacement of trailing elements with zeros.",

        "cot_2": "Okay, let's see. I need to figure out the pattern that transforms the input matrices into the output matrices. Let's look at the training examples one by one.\n\nStarting with Example 0. The input is three rows:\n\n[2, 2, 1]\n[2, 3, 1]\n[1, 1, 1]\n\nThe output has five rows. The first output row is [1,2,3], then each subsequent row has zeros replacing some elements. Hmm. Let's see how the input maps to the output.\n\nLooking at the input's columns. The first column in the input is [2,2,1]. The output's first element is 1. Then the second column is [2,3,1], which becomes 2, then 3. Wait, maybe they are taking the unique elements from each column, sorted in ascending order, and then stacking them vertically, but with some zeros added as we go down?\n\nWait, let's check the first example. The output first row is [1,2,3]. Let's look at each column of the input:\n\nFirst column of input is 2,2,1. The unique elements sorted are 1,2. But in the output's first row, the first element is 1. Then the second column is 2,3,1. Uniques sorted are 1,2,3. Third column is 1,1,1. Unique is 1. So the first output row is [1,2,3]. Then the next rows have [1,2,0], etc. Maybe the output is building layers where each layer takes the next unique element from the columns, and fills zeros otherwise.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's processing each column and taking the unique elements in order, then the output rows are built by taking each level of these unique elements, padding with zeros where there are no more elements.\n\nFor example, in Example 0:\n\nColumn 1: [2,2,1] sorted unique is [1,2]. So first element is 1, then 2, then 0.\n\nColumn 2: [2,3,1] sorted unique is [1,2,3]. So elements are 1,2,3.\n\nColumn 3: [1] so 1, then 0, then 0.\n\nBut the output rows are:\n\nRow 0: [1,2,3] \u2192 max elements from each column's unique list?\n\nWait, the first output row has 1 (from column 1's first unique), 2 (column 2's first unique?), 3 (column 3's first unique?), but that doesn't fit. Wait, column 3's unique is 1. So maybe I'm misunderstanding.\n\nWait, let's look again. The first output row in Example 0 is [1,2,3]. Let's check each column's unique sorted values:\n\nColumn 1: sorted unique is [1,2]. The first element is 1.\n\nColumn 2: sorted unique is [1,2,3]. The second element is 2?\n\nWait, but the first output row is 1,2,3. So column 3's unique is [1], so how does 3 come here? That doesn't fit. Maybe I'm approaching this wrong.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is constructed by taking the transpose of the input and then processing each row. Let's see.\n\nOriginal input for Example 0 is three rows:\n\nRow0: 2,2,1\n\nRow1: 2,3,1\n\nRow2: 1,1,1\n\nTransposing this gives three columns:\n\nColumn0: 2,2,1 \u2192 becomes column in output first row as 1,2,3? No. Wait, maybe not.\n\nAnother approach: looking at the output rows, the number of rows in the output is equal to the maximum number of unique elements in any column of the input. Let's check.\n\nIn Example 0, column 2 has 3 unique elements (1,2,3). So output has 3 rows? Wait, but Example0's output has 5 rows. Hmm, that doesn't fit.\n\nWait, Example0's output has 5 rows. Let's count:\n\nFirst output row: [1,2,3]\n\nSecond: [1,2,0]\n\nThird: [1,2,0]\n\nFourth: [1,0,0]\n\nFifth: [1,0,0]\n\nHmm, that's 5 rows. So maybe the number of output rows is determined by the maximum number of unique elements in any column plus some additional steps. But in Example0, column2 has 3 unique elements. But output has 5 rows. So that's not matching.\n\nAlternative idea: The output is built by \"peeling\" layers from the input. For each layer, we take the smallest elements from each column, then remove them from the input and proceed to the next layer. But how?\n\nLooking at Example0's input:\n\nOriginal input:\n\n[2,2,1]\n\n[2,3,1]\n\n[1,1,1]\n\nIf we look at each column's unique elements sorted:\n\nColumn0: 1,2\n\nColumn1: 1,2,3\n\nColumn2:1\n\nSo the first layer takes the smallest unique from each column: 1 (col0), 1 (col1), 1 (col2) \u2192 but the first output row is [1,2,3]. That doesn't align.\n\nWait, maybe each output row represents the count of elements in each column at different levels. Like, for each column, we list the unique elements in sorted order, and each row in the output corresponds to the next unique element, filling zeros when there are no more. Then, the output is formed by taking each column's unique elements in ascending order and stacking them vertically, with zeros for padding.\n\nFor example, in Example0:\n\nColumn0: sorted unique [1,2]\n\nColumn1: sorted unique [1,2,3]\n\nColumn2: sorted unique [1]\n\nSo for each row in the output:\n\nRow0: first elements of each column's sorted unique: 1,1,1 \u2192 but the output row0 is [1,2,3]. Hmm, that's not matching. Alternatively, maybe the output rows are the unique elements sorted in descending order? Let's see.\n\nWait, in Example0's output, first row is [1,2,3]. Column1's unique is 1,2,3. So maybe each output row is taking the next highest unique from each column. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe for each column, we list the unique elements in ascending order, and for each row in the output, we take the ith element from each column's list. If a column's list is shorter, pad with zero. Then, the output rows are built from these.\n\nBut in Example0:\n\nColumn0's list: [1,2]\n\nColumn1's list: [1,2,3]\n\nColumn2's list: [1]\n\nSo for row0: take index 0 from each column \u2192 1,1,1 \u2192 but output row0 is [1,2,3]. Doesn't match.\n\nRow0 in output is [1,2,3]. So for each column, maybe it's the maximum unique value?\n\nColumn0's max is 2, column1's max is 3, column2's max is 1. But output row0 has 1,2,3. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each output row is the sorted unique elements of each row in the input, but that doesn't make sense. Let's think of Example0's input rows. The first input row is [2,2,1], which when sorted is [1,2,2]. Unique elements would be [1,2], but output row0 is [1,2,3], which isn't from any row.\n\nAlternative approach: look at the output rows and how they change. The first output row is the unique elements from each column, sorted ascendingly, but perhaps taking the first occurrence. Wait, but how?\n\nIn Example0's output, the first row is [1,2,3]. Let's see:\n\nLooking at the input columns:\n\nColumn0: 2,2,1 \u2192 unique sorted \u2192 1,2.\n\nColumn1: 2,3,1 \u2192 unique sorted \u2192 1,2,3.\n\nColumn2: 1,1,1 \u2192 unique is 1.\n\nSo if we arrange each column's unique elements sorted in ascending order, then the output rows are constructed by taking the first element of each column's unique list, then the second, then third, etc., padding with zeros where the column has no more elements. Then, each output row is built from the nth elements of each column's unique list.\n\nFor example:\n\nIn Example0:\n\nColumn0's unique list: [1,2]\n\nColumn1's unique list: [1,2,3]\n\nColumn2's unique list: [1]\n\nSo for the output rows:\n\nRow0: 1 (col0 first), 1 (col1 first), 1 (col2 first) \u2192 but the actual row0 is [1,2,3]. So that's not matching.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the columns are being processed in reverse order. Let me check:\n\nIf column0's unique is [1,2], column1's [1,2,3], column2's [1].\n\nIf we take the first elements as 1 (col0), 1 (col1), 1 (col2), which is [1,1,1], but row0 is [1,2,3]. So that's not matching.\n\nWait, perhaps it's the reverse. Maybe each output row is taking the next highest unique from each column. Let's see.\n\nExample0's output first row is [1,2,3].\n\nColumn0's max is 2, column1's max is 3, column2's max is 1. So the first row is the max of each column? No, because in column0, the max is 2, but output row0's first element is 1. So that's not it.\n\nAlternative idea: The output is the transpose of the input, processed somehow. Let's see.\n\nOriginal input in Example0:\n\nRow0: 2,2,1\n\nRow1:2,3,1\n\nRow2:1,1,1\n\nTranspose is:\n\nColumn0:2,2,1 \u2192 becomes [1,2] (unique sorted)\n\nColumn1:2,3,1 \u2192 [1,2,3]\n\nColumn2:1,1,1 \u2192 [1]\n\nSo the transposed columns are [1,2], [1,2,3], [1].\n\nThen the output could be arranging these lists vertically, padding with zeros to match the maximum length.\n\nMaximum length is 3 (from column1). So:\n\nRow0: 1,1,1 \u2192 but output row0 is [1,2,3]. Doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each output row is the next element in the reversed sorted unique list of each column. Let's check.\n\nFor column0: sorted unique [1,2]. Reversed is [2,1].\n\nFor column1: [3,2,1].\n\nFor column2: [1].\n\nSo the first row would take the first elements: 2,3,1 \u2192 but output row0 is [1,2,3]. Not matching.\n\nWait, perhaps the output is built by taking the unique elements from each row of the input, sorted, and stacked. But in Example0, the rows are [2,2,1], [2,3,1], [1,1,1]. The unique elements sorted for each row are [1,2], [1,2,3], [1]. Stacking them would give three rows, but the output has five. So that's not it.\n\nHmm. Maybe looking for the number of times each unique element appears in the column, and the output represents the counts in some way. But not sure.\n\nAlternatively, think about the output rows as levels of a pyramid. Each subsequent row has one less non-zero element. Let's check Example0:\n\nOutput rows:\n\n[1,2,3] \u2192 3 elements\n\n[1,2,0] \u2192 2 elements\n\n[1,2,0] \u2192 2 elements\n\n[1,0,0] \u2192 1 element\n\n[1,0,0] \u2192 1 element\n\nBut how does this relate to the input?\n\nAlternatively, maybe each output row is the result of a certain operation applied to the input rows. For example, the first output row could be the minimum of each column, then next row is next minimum after removing previous elements. But in Example0's input columns:\n\nColumn0: min is 1, then 2.\n\nSo first output row for column0 is 1, then 2. But the output rows for column0 in Example0 are 1, then 1, then 1, then 1, then 1. That doesn't fit.\n\nAlternative approach: Let's compare the input and output for Example1.\n\nExample1 input:\n\n[3,1,1,4]\n\n[2,2,2,4]\n\n[4,4,4,4]\n\nOutput:\n\n[4,2,1,3]\n\n[4,2,1,0]\n\n[4,2,0,0]\n\n[4,0,0,0]\n\n[4,0,0,0]\n\n[4,0,0,0]\n\nLooking at the output first row [4,2,1,3]. Let's check the input columns:\n\nColumn0: 3,2,4 \u2192 sorted unique [2,3,4]\n\nColumn1:1,2,4 \u2192 sorted unique [1,2,4]\n\nColumn2:1,2,4 \u2192 sorted unique [1,2,4]\n\nColumn3:4,4,4 \u2192 [4]\n\nIf the output rows are taking the maximum of each column, then first row would be 4,4,4,4. But the first output row is [4,2,1,3]. Doesn't match.\n\nAlternatively, the first row could be the unique elements from each column sorted in descending order. For column0: sorted descending unique [4,3,2]. Column1: [4,2,1]. Column2: [4,2,1]. Column3: [4]. Then, the first output row would take the first elements of each column's sorted unique list: 4 (col0), 4 (col1),4 (col2),4 (col3). But the output row is [4,2,1,3]. Doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, the output rows are the unique elements sorted in descending order, but for each column, and then each output row is built by taking the next element in this list. For example:\n\nColumn0 sorted desc:4,3,2 \u2192 but the first output row's first element is4. Then next rows would have 3, then 2, etc.\n\nBut in the output rows of Example1:\n\nFirst row:4,2,1,3. Hmm. Column1's sorted desc is4,2,1. So first element is4 (col0), 2 (col1),1 (col2),3 (col3? Column3's sorted unique is4. So how does 3 come into play here?\n\nWait, column3's unique is only 4, so where does the 3 come from in the first output row's last element?\n\nThis suggests that perhaps the columns are being processed in a different order. Let me think again.\n\nLooking at Example1's first output row: [4,2,1,3]. Let's see the input columns:\n\nColumn0:3,2,4 \u2192 unique sorted [2,3,4]\n\nColumn1:1,2,4 \u2192 [1,2,4]\n\nColumn2:1,2,4 \u2192 [1,2,4]\n\nColumn3:4 \u2192 [4]\n\nSo if each column's unique elements are sorted in ascending order, then the first row is taking the last element (max) from each column. For column0:4, column1:4, column2:4, column3:4 \u2192 [4,4,4,4], but the output is [4,2,1,3]. Doesn't match.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the elements are arranged in descending order, but per column, and then the output rows are taking the elements from left to right, but that's not clear.\n\nWait, the first output row of Example1 is [4,2,1,3]. Let's see:\n\n4 is the max of column0 (3,2,4 \u2192 max 4).\n\n2 is the second element in column1's sorted unique list. But column1's sorted unique is [1,2,4]. Second element is 2.\n\n1 is the first element in column2's sorted unique [1,2,4]. Hmm, but why 1 here?\n\nAnd 3 is the second element in column0's sorted unique [2,3,4]. So this seems inconsistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is a combination of the unique elements from each row in some way. Or perhaps the output is a diagonalization of the unique elements.\n\nAlternatively, think of the output as the elements from the input matrix arranged in a certain way. For instance, in Example1's output, the first row has 4,2,1,3. The input has rows with 3,1,1,4; 2,2,2,4; 4,4,4,4. Maybe it's the unique elements sorted in some order. The unique elements in the entire input are 1,2,3,4. But the output first row has 4,2,1,3. Which is sorted in descending order except for the 3 at the end. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each output row corresponds to a level where the elements are the counts of how many times they appear in each column. For example, the first row is the count of the most frequent element in each column.\n\nBut let's check Example0. Column0 has 2 appearing twice and 1 once. Most frequent is 2, but the first output element is 1. So that's not matching.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's the distinct elements in the order they appear when the columns are read from top to bottom, then left to right. For example, in Example0's input columns:\n\nColumn0: 2,2,1 \u2192 distinct elements in order: 2,1.\n\nColumn1:2,3,1 \u2192 distinct in order:2,3,1.\n\nColumn2:1 \u2192 1.\n\nThen, the output rows are formed by taking the first occurrence of each distinct element in each column, but arranged in some way.\n\nBut the first output row is [1,2,3]. How does that come?\n\nAlternatively, the output rows are the unique elements from each column sorted in ascending order, but rotated. For example, column0 sorted [1,2], column1 [1,2,3], column2 [1]. Then, the output rows are arranged such that each subsequent row shifts the elements. But I'm not seeing how.\n\nAnother angle: looking at the number of rows in the output. For Example0's input, the output has 5 rows. The input has 3 rows. The output rows seem to have a pattern where each row has one more zero than the previous, but not exactly. Let's count the number of non-zero elements in each output row of Example0:\n\nRow0: 3 non-zero.\n\nRow1: 2.\n\nRow2: 2.\n\nRow3:1.\n\nRow4:1.\n\nSo it decreases but not strictly. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, the output rows are structured in such a way that each row is the previous row but with the last non-zero element turned to zero. But in Example0, the first row is [1,2,3], then [1,2,0], which fits. Then again [1,2,0], which is the same as previous. Then [1,0,0], etc. So maybe after the first row, each subsequent row replaces the next element with zero, proceeding from right to left.\n\nBut how does that relate to the input? Because the first row's elements would need to be ordered in a specific way.\n\nAlternatively, the first row is the sorted list of all unique elements in the entire input, and each subsequent row removes the largest element and zeros it. Let's test this.\n\nIn Example0, the input elements are 1,2,3. So sorted is [1,2,3]. First row is [1,2,3]. Next row removes the last (3) \u2192 [1,2,0]. Then same again. Then remove 2 \u2192 [1,0,0]. Then same. But how does this explain the number of output rows?\n\nIn Example0, output has 5 rows. If the unique elements are [1,2,3], then the first row is [1,2,3], then each subsequent row removes one element from the end. So rows would be:\n\n[1,2,3]\n\n[1,2,0]\n\n[1,0,0]\n\nBut that's 3 rows, not 5. So perhaps this isn't the case.\n\nLooking back at the examples, perhaps the output rows are built by transposing the input and then for each row in the transposed input, taking the unique elements sorted in ascending order, and then stacking them in such a way that each output row is a diagonal accumulation of these uniques.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the result of taking each column of the input, extracting the unique elements in ascending order, and then stacking them in a way that each output row contains the elements of the current level, with zeros where the column doesn't have that many unique elements.\n\nFor example, in Example0:\n\nColumn0 unique sorted [1,2]\n\nColumn1 [1,2,3]\n\nColumn2 [1]\n\nSo for each level (row) in the output:\n\nRow0: first unique elements: 1 (col0), 1 (col1), 1 (col2) \u2192 [1,1,1]. But the actual output row is [1,2,3]. Doesn't match.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each output row corresponds to the ith unique element in each column, but starting from the largest. For example:\n\nColumn0 sorted desc [2,1]. So row0 would take 2 (col0), 3 (col1), 1 (col2) \u2192 [2,3,1]. But Example0's first output row is [1,2,3]. Not matching.\n\nHmm. This is tricky. Let me look at another example. Example2.\n\nExample2 input:\n\n[8,8,2]\n\n[3,8,8]\n\n[3,3,4]\n\n[3,3,4]\n\nOutput:\n\n[3,8,4,2]\n\n[3,8,4,0]\n\n[3,8,0,0]\n\n[3,8,0,0]\n\n[3,0,0,0]\n\nThe first output row is [3,8,4,2]. How does that relate to the input columns?\n\nTransposing the input gives columns:\n\nColumn0:8,3,3,3 \u2192 unique sorted [3,8]\n\nColumn1:8,8,3,3 \u2192 unique sorted [3,8]\n\nColumn2:2,8,4,4 \u2192 unique sorted [2,4,8]\n\nWait, but the output has 4 elements. Maybe the input has 4 columns? No, the input has 3 columns. Wait, the input for Example2 is:\n\nInput is four rows, each with three elements. So transpose would have three columns of four elements each.\n\nWait, the output has four elements in each row, which matches the number of columns in the output. Wait, the test input has four columns. Let me check the examples.\n\nExample0: input has 3 columns, output has 3 columns.\n\nExample1: input has 4 columns, output has 4 columns.\n\nExample2: input has 3 columns, but the output has 4 columns. Wait, looking at the output for Example2:\n\nThe first row is [3,8,4,2]. Wait, how does that happen? The input has three columns. So maybe there's a mistake here. Let me check.\n\nNo, Example2's input is:\n\n[8,8,2]\n\n[3,8,8]\n\n[3,3,4]\n\n[3,3,4]\n\nWhich is four rows, each with three elements. So transpose would have three columns. But the output has four columns. So this suggests that the output isn't directly related to the number of columns in the input.\n\nWait, maybe each output row has the same number of elements as the maximum number of unique elements in any column. Example0's output rows have three elements, which matches the maximum number of unique elements (3 in column1). Example1's output rows have four elements, which matches the maximum number of unique elements in any column (column0 has 3, column1 has 3, column2 has 3, column3 has 1. Wait, no. Example1's input columns:\n\nColumn0:3,2,4 \u2192 3 unique elements.\n\nColumn1:1,2,4 \u2192 3.\n\nColumn2:1,2,4 \u2192 3.\n\nColumn3:4 \u2192 1.\n\nSo maximum is 3, but output rows have 4 elements. Hmm, so that's not matching.\n\nAlternatively, the output rows have the same number of elements as the number of columns in the input. Example0: 3 columns, output rows have 3 elements. Example1:4 columns, output rows have4 elements. Example2:3 columns, but the output rows have4 elements. Wait, that's conflicting.\n\nWait, looking back at Example2's output:\n\n[3,8,4,2]\n\nThis has four elements. But the input has three columns. How is this possible? Maybe the test case is different, but according to the user's examples, Example2's output has four elements per row. So perhaps there's a mistake in the problem statement, or I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps the input for Example2 has four columns? Let me check:\n\nExample2's input is:\n\n[8,8,2]\n\n[3,8,8]\n\n[3,3,4]\n\n[3,3,4]\n\nEach row has three elements, four rows. So the input is a 4x3 matrix. But the output is:\n\n[3,8,4,2]\n\n[3,8,4,0]\n\n[3,8,0,0]\n\n[3,8,0,0]\n\n[3,0,0,0]\n\nWhich has five rows, each with four elements. So the output has one more column than the input. Hmm, that complicates things.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is including elements from both rows and columns of the input. But how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is constructed by considering each row of the input as a column in the output, but that doesn't seem to fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the sorted unique elements of each row of the input, but stacked in a particular way.\n\nFor Example2's input:\n\nRow0: [8,8,2] \u2192 sorted unique [2,8]\n\nRow1: [3,8,8] \u2192 [3,8]\n\nRow2: [3,3,4] \u2192 [3,4]\n\nRow3: [3,3,4] \u2192 [3,4]\n\nThen, maybe the output rows are built by taking the elements from each row's unique sorted list, padding with zeros to match the maximum length. But the maximum length is 2. So output would have two rows. But Example2's output has five rows. Doesn't fit.\n\nThis is getting confusing. Let me try another approach: look for patterns in the output structure.\n\nIn Example0's output:\n\nRows decrease in the number of non-zero elements from 3 to 1, but with duplicates. The first row is [1,2,3]. Second and third are [1,2,0]. Fourth and fifth are [1,0,0].\n\nIt's as if after the first row, each subsequent row replaces the last non-zero element with zero, but sometimes repeating the same row.\n\nIn Example1's output:\n\nRows start with [4,2,1,3], then each row replaces the last non-zero with zero, but again, the first row ends with 3, then next row ends with 0. But how does that 3 come into play?\n\nWait, maybe the output is constructed by listing the unique elements of each column in descending order, and then each row after the first sets one more element to zero, starting from the right.\n\nFor Example0:\n\nColumns:\n\nColumn0: [2,2,1] \u2192 unique sorted descending [2,1]\n\nColumn1: [2,3,1] \u2192 [3,2,1]\n\nColumn2: [1] \u2192 [1]\n\nSo the unique elements in descending order per column:\n\ncol0:2,1\n\ncol1:3,2,1\n\ncol2:1\n\nNow, the output rows would be:\n\nRow0: 2 (col0), 3 (col1),1 (col2) \u2192 [2,3,1]. But the actual first output row is [1,2,3]. Doesn't match.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps sorted in ascending order:\n\ncol0:1,2\n\ncol1:1,2,3\n\ncol2:1\n\nThen the first output row would take the last element of each sorted list:\n\ncol0:2\n\ncol1:3\n\ncol2:1 \u2192 [2,3,1]. Not matching Example0's first row [1,2,3].\n\nHmm.\n\nWait, in Example0's output first row [1,2,3], perhaps these are the unique elements from the entire input, sorted. The input elements are 1,2,3. So [1,2,3]. Then the next rows remove elements from the right, replacing with zeros. But how does that explain the other examples?\n\nExample1's input has elements 1,2,3,4. The first output row is [4,2,1,3]. Which is not sorted. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAnother observation: in Example0's output, the first row [1,2,3] has elements in ascending order, but the columns in the input have their unique elements sorted. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the first output row is the sorted list of the first occurrence of each unique element in the input, read row-wise. But in Example0's input, the first occurrences are 2 (row0), 3 (row1), 1 (row2). So sorted [1,2,3], which matches the first output row. Then, each subsequent row removes the largest element and adds a zero. So next row would be [1,2,0], then [1,0,0], etc. But why are there two [1,2,0] rows and two [1,0,0] rows?\n\nIn Example0's output, after the first row, the next two rows are [1,2,0], then two [1,0,0]. This suggests that the number of times a row is repeated depends on the number of times the next element to be removed appears in the input. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each output row corresponds to a distinct count of elements remaining. Like, the first row has all elements, then each next row removes one element from the right, but repeats rows based on the number of occurrences. But this is vague.\n\nAnother thought: the output rows might be constructed by taking the unique elements from each row of the input, then stacking them in a way that the first row contains all unique elements sorted, and each subsequent row removes the largest element, padding with zeros.\n\nIn Example0, the unique elements are 1,2,3. Sorted as [1,2,3]. Then:\n\nRow0: [1,2,3]\n\nRow1: [1,2,0]\n\nRow2: [1,0,0]\n\nBut in the actual output, there are two [1,2,0] and two [1,0,0]. So why the repeats? Maybe the number of repeats corresponds to the number of times the removed element appeared in the input.\n\nFor Example0, after removing 3, which appears once, so one row. Then removing 2, which appears multiple times, so two rows. Then removing 1, which appears three times, so three rows. But this doesn't align exactly with the example's output.\n\nAlternatively, the number of output rows is determined by the maximum number of unique elements in any column. For Example0, column1 has 3 unique elements, so 3 rows. But the output has 5 rows. So that's not it.\n\nThis is getting frustrating. Let's try to find a different angle. Let's look at the test input and see if I can find a pattern.\n\nTest input:\n\n[8,8,2,2]\n\n[1,8,8,2]\n\n[1,3,3,4]\n\n[1,1,1,1]\n\nSo four rows, each with four elements.\n\nTransposing gives four columns:\n\nColumn0:8,1,1,1 \u2192 sorted unique [1,8]\n\nColumn1:8,8,3,1 \u2192 sorted unique [1,3,8]\n\nColumn2:2,8,3,1 \u2192 sorted unique [1,2,3,8]\n\nColumn3:2,2,4,1 \u2192 sorted unique [1,2,4]\n\nNow, if the output is created by taking each column's sorted unique elements in ascending order and then creating rows by taking the ith element from each column, padding with zeros where needed, then the output would have as many rows as the maximum number of unique elements in any column. For the test input:\n\nColumn0: 2 elements.\n\nColumn1: 3 elements.\n\nColumn2:4 elements.\n\nColumn3:3 elements.\n\nSo maximum is 4. So four rows. But looking at the training examples, for example Example0's output has 5 rows when the maximum unique per column is 3. So that's not matching.\n\nBut maybe after creating the rows for each unique level, there are additional rows that repeat the last non-zero elements with some logic. For example, after the rows generated from the unique elements, you add rows by setting the rightmost non-zero element to zero until all are zero.\n\nIn Example0's case:\n\nUnique levels:\n\nRow0:1 (col0),1 (col1),1 (col2) \u2192 [1,1,1]. But actual row0 is [1,2,3]. Not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the first output row is the reversed sorted unique elements of the entire input. For Example0's input, elements are 1,2,3. Sorted descending gives [3,2,1]. But the first output row is [1,2,3]. Doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each output row is the elements from the columns' unique elements sorted in ascending order, but arranged in the output row in the order of the columns' appearance. For example, column0's unique sorted, column1's, etc. Then each row is formed by taking the ith element from each column's list.\n\nFor the test input's columns:\n\nColumn0: [1,8]\n\nColumn1: [1,3,8]\n\nColumn2: [1,2,3,8]\n\nColumn3: [1,2,4]\n\nSo for each row:\n\nRow0: 1 (col0), 1 (col1), 1 (col2), 1 (col3) \u2192 [1,1,1,1]\n\nRow1:8 (col0),3 (col1),2 (col2),2 (col3) \u2192 [8,3,2,2]\n\nRow2:0 (col0),8 (col1),3 (col2),4 (col3) \u2192 [0,8,3,4]\n\nRow3:0 (col0),0 (col1),8 (col2),0 (col3) \u2192 [0,0,8,0]\n\nBut the output from the examples doesn't look like this. For instance, Example0's first output row would be [1,1,1], but it's [1,2,3]. So this approach isn't working.\n\nMaybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let's look for another pattern. In Example3's output:\n\nInput:\n\n[1,1,1]\n\n[2,2,1]\n\n[2,8,1]\n\n[2,8,1]\n\nOutput:\n\n[1,2,8]\n\n[1,2,8]\n\n[1,2,0]\n\n[1,2,0]\n\n[1,0,0]\n\n[1,0,0]\n\nThe first output row is [1,2,8]. Looking at the input's columns:\n\nColumn0:1,2,2,2 \u2192 unique [1,2]\n\nColumn1:1,2,8,8 \u2192 [1,2,8]\n\nColumn2:1 \u2192 [1]\n\nSo the first row of output is [1 (from column0), 2 (from column1), 8 (from column2?)]. But column2's unique is 1. So that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, maybe it's taking the maximum from each column. Column0's max is 2, column1's max is8, column2's max is1. So output row would be [2,8,1]. But the first row is [1,2,8]. Not matching.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output rows are formed by the unique elements from each column, but in the order they first appear. For example:\n\nColumn0:1 appears first, then 2.\n\nColumn1:1, then 2, then8.\n\nColumn2:1.\n\nSo the first output row is the first unique from each column: 1,1,1 \u2192 but output is [1,2,8]. Not matching.\n\nHmm. Let's think of the output rows as layers, where each layer includes elements from each column in a certain order. For example, in Example3's output:\n\nRow0: [1,2,8]\n\nRow1: [1,2,8]\n\nRow2: [1,2,0]\n\nRow3: [1,2,0]\n\nRow4: [1,0,0]\n\nRow5: [1,0,0]\n\nIt seems like the first two rows preserve the 8 in column2, then it becomes zero. But in the input's column2, all elements are 1, so why is there an 8 in the output's column3?\n\nWait, perhaps the output is built based on the rows of the input. Let's look at Example3's input rows:\n\nRow0: [1,1,1]\n\nRow1: [2,2,1]\n\nRow2: [2,8,1]\n\nRow3: [2,8,1]\n\nThe output's first row is [1,2,8], which are the new elements introduced in each row. Row0 introduces 1, row1 introduces 2, row2 introduces 8. Then, each subsequent row appends zeros. But how does this explain the output structure?\n\nAlternatively, the output rows are the unique elements from each column, sorted in ascending order, but arranged diagonally. For example, in Example3's columns:\n\nColumn0:1,2 \u2192 sorted [1,2]\n\nColumn1:1,2,8 \u2192 [1,2,8]\n\nColumn2:1 \u2192 [1]\n\nSo the output might be:\n\nRow0:1 (col0),2 (col1),8 (col2) \u2192 but column2 has only 1. This doesn't fit. So this can't be right.\n\nI'm stuck. Let me try to look for another pattern. Maybe each output row corresponds to a row in the input, and the elements are the unique values from that row, sorted, and padded with zeros to the maximum number of unique elements across all rows.\n\nFor example, in Example0's input:\n\nRow0: [2,2,1] \u2192 unique [1,2]\n\nRow1: [2,3,1] \u2192 [1,2,3]\n\nRow2: [1,1,1] \u2192 [1]\n\nMax unique per row is 3. So output rows would be:\n\nRow0: [1,2,0]\n\nRow1: [1,2,3]\n\nRow2: [1,0,0]\n\nBut Example0's output is different. So that's not it.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the result of some matrix operation, like element-wise addition or multiplication. But not seeing it.\n\nAnother approach: notice that in Example0's output, the first row is [1,2,3], which are the unique elements of the entire input sorted. Then, each subsequent row removes the highest remaining element and adds a zero. But in Example0's case:\n\nRow0: [1,2,3]\n\nRow1: [1,2,0] (remove 3)\n\nRow2: [1,2,0] (again?)\n\nRow3: [1,0,0] (remove 2)\n\nRow4: [1,0,0] (again?)\n\nBut why the repetition?\n\nMaybe the number of times a row is repeated corresponds to the number of times the removed element appears in the input. For example, 3 appears once in the input, so one row with [1,2,0]. But in Example0's output, there are two such rows. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, the number of rows is determined by the sum of the number of unique elements in each column minus the number of columns plus 1. For Example0, column uniques are 2,3,1 \u2192 sum is 6 -3 +1=4, but output has5 rows. Not sure.\n\nMaybe the answer is to take the unique elements of each column, sorted in ascending order, and then create rows where each row contains the next unique element from each column, with zeros if there are none left. Then, after building these rows, additional rows are added by removing the rightmost non-zero element and replacing it with zero until all are zero.\n\nFor example, in Example0:\n\nColumn uniques:\n\ncol0: [1,2]\n\ncol1: [1,2,3]\n\ncol2: [1]\n\nThe rows from column uniques would be:\n\nRow0:1,1,1\n\nRow1:2,2,0\n\nRow2:0,3,0\n\nBut output is different. So this isn't matching.\n\nBut the first output row of Example0 is [1,2,3], which suggests that it's taking the first element of col0's sorted unique, the second element of col1's sorted unique, and the third element of col2's sorted unique. But col2 only has one element. So this approach also doesn't make sense.\n\nI'm really stuck here. Let's try to look for a different pattern.\n\nLooking at Example2's output:\n\nFirst row: [3,8,4,2]. How does this relate to the input?\n\nInput columns after transposing:\n\ncol0:8,3,3,3 \u2192 sorted unique [3,8]\n\ncol1:8,8,3,3 \u2192 [3,8]\n\ncol2:2,8,4,4 \u2192 [2,4,8]\n\nSo column0's unique sorted:3,8\n\ncolumn1:3,8\n\ncolumn2:2,4,8\n\nThe first output row is [3,8,4,2]. How does this come?\n\nMaybe the output is combining the unique elements from all columns, sorted in descending order, and then each row removes the smallest remaining element. For Example2, all unique elements are 2,3,4,8. Sorted descending:8,4,3,2. So first row would be [8,4,3,2]. But output first row is [3,8,4,2]. Not matching.\n\nAlternatively, sorted in ascending:2,3,4,8. Output first row is [3,8,4,2], which is not sorted.\n\nHmm. Maybe the output rows are built by taking the unique elements from each column in the order of the columns, sorted in ascending order, and then padding with zeros to the right. But then:\n\nExample0's columns:\n\ncol0:1,2\n\ncol1:1,2,3\n\ncol2:1\n\nCombined list: [1,2,1,2,3,1]. Unique sorted:1,2,3. So output first row is [1,2,3], which matches. Then subsequent rows would have [1,2,0], [1,0,0], etc. But why the multiple rows with the same pattern?\n\nAlternatively, the output rows are the elements of the sorted unique list of the entire input, and each row removes the last element and pads with zeros. For Example0, sorted unique is [1,2,3]. Rows:\n\n[1,2,3]\n\n[1,2,0]\n\n[1,0,0]\n\nBut the output has two rows of [1,2,0] and two rows of [1,0,0], perhaps repeated based on the number of columns or some other factor.\n\nBut this doesn't explain Example1's output.\n\nExample1's input sorted unique elements:1,2,3,4. So output first row would be [1,2,3,4], but the actual output is [4,2,1,3]. Doesn't fit.\n\nThis is getting me nowhere. Let's try to think of the output as a kind of triangle or pyramid where each layer is built from the previous by removing elements.\n\nFor Example0's output:\n\n[1,2,3]\n\n[1,2,0]\n\n[1,2,0]\n\n[1,0,0]\n\n[1,0,0]\n\nIt looks like after the first row, each subsequent row replaces one element with zero, starting from the right, but in steps. First replace the last element (3 \u2192 0), then the middle element (2 \u2192 0), but there are two rows with [1,2,0] and two with [1,0,0]. Maybe the number of times a row is repeated is equal to the number of elements that are being removed. For example, removing 3 (count 1) \u2192 one row. Removing 2 (count 2) \u2192 two rows. Removing 1 (count 2) \u2192 two rows. But not sure how this connects to the input.\n\nAnother idea: the output rows are formed by taking the minimum value from each column, then the next minimum after excluding the previous minima, and so on. For Example0:\n\nColumn0 minima:\n\n1 (min), then 2.\n\nColumn1 minima:\n\n1, then 2, then 3.\n\nColumn2 minima:\n\n1.\n\nSo first row would be [1,1,1], but output is [1,2,3]. Doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, take the maximum from each column. Example0's column maxima:2,3,1 \u2192 [2,3,1]. Not matching output.\n\nAnother observation: In Example0's output, the first row is [1,2,3], which are the unique elements of the entire input sorted. Then each subsequent row removes the largest element and adds a zero. But why are there two [1,2,0] and two [1,0,0] rows?\n\nIf the number of rows is determined by the number of elements in the first row plus the number of repeats based on some input property. For example, if the first row has 3 elements, the number of rows is 3 + 2 =5. But this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, the number of output rows is equal to the sum of the number of unique elements in each column. For Example0: 2 +3 +1=6, but output has5 rows. No.\n\nAlternatively, the number of output rows is the sum of the lengths of the unique lists of each column minus the number of columns. For Example0: 2+3+1 -3=3. No.\n\nThis is really challenging. Let's try to think of the test input and see what the expected output might be, based on the examples.\n\nTest input:\n\n[8,8,2,2]\n\n[1,8,8,2]\n\n[1,3,3,4]\n\n[1,1,1,1]\n\nTransposing gives four columns:\n\ncol0:8,1,1,1 \u2192 unique sorted [1,8]\n\ncol1:8,8,3,1 \u2192 [1,3,8]\n\ncol2:2,8,3,1 \u2192 [1,2,3,8]\n\ncol3:2,2,4,1 \u2192 [1,2,4]\n\nNow, in the examples, the output rows seem to list the unique elements of each column in sorted order (ascending or descending), and then each row removes the last element.\n\nFor example, in Example1's output, the first row is [4,2,1,3]. The columns' unique elements sorted in descending order:\n\ncol0:4,3,2 \u2192 [4,3,2]\n\ncol1:4,2,1 \u2192 [4,2,1]\n\ncol2:4,2,1 \u2192 [4,2,1]\n\ncol3:4 \u2192 [4]\n\nSo the first row is [4,2,1,4], but Example1's first row is [4,2,1,3]. Hmm, this doesn't match.\n\nAlternatively, the output first row is the maximum of each column, the next row is the second maximum, etc. For Example1:\n\ncol0 maxima:4,3,2 \u2192 first row's first element is4.\n\ncol1 maxima:4,2,1 \u2192 first row's second element is4.\n\nBut Example1's first row is [4,2,1,3]. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, the output rows are the unique elements from each column sorted in ascending order, and then arranged in a way that each row contains the next set of elements. For the test input columns:\n\ncol0:1,8\n\ncol1:1,3,8\n\ncol2:1,2,3,8\n\ncol3:1,2,4\n\nSo for each row:\n\nRow0:1 (col0),1 (col1),1 (col2),1 (col3) \u2192 [1,1,1,1]\n\nRow1:8 (col0),3 (col1),2 (col2),2 (col3) \u2192 [8,3,2,2]\n\nRow2:0 (col0),8 (col1),3 (col2),4 (col3) \u2192 [0,8,3,4]\n\nRow3:0 (col0),0 (col1),8 (col2),0 (col3) \u2192 [0,0,8,0]\n\nBut this doesn't match any of the example outputs. For instance, Example0's output first row is [1,2,3], which doesn't fit this pattern.\n\nAt this point, I'm not able to discern the exact pattern. Given the time I've spent and the lack of progress, I'll have to make an educated guess based on the examples.\n\nLooking at the examples, the output seems to consist of the unique elements from each column, sorted in ascending order, arranged in such a way that each row represents a level where the elements are taken from each column's sorted unique list in reverse order (descending), and then each subsequent row removes the smallest element, replacing it with zero.\n\nFor example, in Example1:\n\nColumns' unique elements sorted ascending:\n\ncol0:2,3,4\n\ncol1:1,2,4\n\ncol2:1,2,4\n\ncol3:4\n\nSo the first row takes the largest elements:4 (col0),4 (col1),4 (col2),4 (col3) \u2192 [4,4,4,4]. But Example1's first row is [4,2,1,3]. Doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, the output rows are the unique elements of each column sorted in descending order, and each row takes the next element from each column's list, padding with zeros. For Example0:\n\nColumns sorted descending:\n\ncol0:2,1\n\ncol1:3,2,1\n\ncol2:1\n\nOutput rows would be:\n\nRow0:2,3,1 \u2192 [2,3,1]\n\nRow1:1,2,0 \u2192 [1,2,0]\n\nRow2:0,1,0 \u2192 [0,1,0]\n\nBut the actual output is different. So this isn't matching.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and the lack of a clear pattern, I think I need to make a guess based on the examples provided. It seems that the output rows are formed by taking the unique elements from each column, sorted in ascending order, and then each row after the first removes the rightmost element and replaces it with zero, possibly repeating rows based on the number of elements removed.\n\nFor the test input:\n\nColumns after transpose:\n\ncol0: [1,8] sorted ascending \u2192 [1,8]\n\ncol1: [1,3,8] \u2192 [1,3,8]\n\ncol2: [1,2,3,8] \u2192 [1,2,3,8]\n\ncol3: [1,2,4] \u2192 [1,2,4]\n\nSo the first output row would be the maximum of each column's unique elements. Column0 max is8, col1 max 8, col2 max 8, col3 max4. So first row [8,8,8,4]. But this doesn't match the examples' outputs.\n\nAlternatively, the first row is the unique elements of each column sorted in ascending order and arranged in the output row as the last elements of each column's list. For example:\n\ncol0's list:1,8 \u2192 last element is8.\n\ncol1's list:1,3,8 \u2192 last element 8.\n\ncol2's list:1,2,3,8 \u2192 last element8.\n\ncol3's list:1,2,4 \u2192 last element4.\n\nSo first row would be [8,8,8,4]. But looking at Example0's first row is [1,2,3], which would be the last elements of columns' sorted unique lists. col0's last element is2, col1's 3, col2's 1. So [2,3,1], but the output is [1,2,3]. Doesn't fit.\n\nAnother possibility: the first output row is the sorted list of all unique elements in the entire input, and each subsequent row removes the largest element and adds a zero. For the test input:\n\nUnique elements:1,2,3,4,8. Sorted ascending [1,2,3,4,8]. First row would be [1,2,3,4,8], but the test input has four columns, so output rows have four elements. So maybe it's the first four unique elements sorted in some order. But I'm not sure.\n\nGiven that I'm stuck, I'll look for a pattern in the output examples and try to mimic that.\n\nLooking at Example0's input and output:\n\nInput has columns with unique elements:\n\ncol0:1,2\n\ncol1:1,2,3\n\ncol2:1\n\nThe output's first row is [1,2,3]. Then subsequent rows have zeros replacing elements from the right.\n\nSo perhaps the first row is the sorted unique elements of the entire input, arranged in ascending order, and then each row after removes the largest element and adds a zero. But Example0's input has unique elements [1,2,3], so first row [1,2,3], then [1,2,0], then [1,0,0], but the output has two [1,2,0] and two [1,0,0].\n\nPerhaps the number of rows is determined by the number of elements in the first row plus the number of times elements are removed. For example, first row has 3 elements, then two steps to remove each element, leading to 3 + 2 =5 rows.\n\nApplying this to the test input:\n\nUnique elements sorted:1,2,3,4,8. So first row would be [1,2,3,4,8]. But the test input has four columns, so output rows would have four elements. This suggests that the first row is [1,2,3,4], then [1,2,3,0], etc. But this doesn't match any examples.\n\nAlternatively, the first row is the unique elements of each column's sorted unique elements, taking the first element from each column's list. For example:\n\nTest input columns:\n\ncol0:1,8 \u2192 first element 1.\n\ncol1:1,3,8 \u2192 first 1.\n\ncol2:1,2,3,8 \u2192 first 1.\n\ncol3:1,2,4 \u2192 first 1.\n\nFirst row: [1,1,1,1]. But this doesn't match the examples.\n\nGiven that I'm unable to find a clear pattern, I'll have to make an educated guess based on the examples provided, especially focusing on the first example.\n\nIn Example0, the output rows are:\n\n[1,2,3]\n\n[1,2,0]\n\n[1,2,0]\n\n[1,0,0]\n\n[1,0,0]\n\nThe first row contains the sorted unique elements of the entire input. Then each subsequent row replaces the last non-zero element with zero, sometimes repeating.\n\nApplying this to the test input:\n\nThe unique elements sorted are 1,2,3,4,8. But since the output should have four elements per row (same as the input columns), perhaps the first row is [1,2,3,4], then next rows replace the last element with zero:\n\n[1,2,3,4]\n\n[1,2,3,0]\n\n[1,2,0,0]\n\n[1,0,0,0]\n\n[1,0,0,0]\n\n[1,0,0,0]\n\nBut looking at Example3's output, which has six rows for an input with three columns, this might not fit. But Example3's output has three columns in the output, but the test input's output would have four.\n\nAlternatively, the first row is the sorted unique elements of the entire input, but limited to the number of columns. For the test input, four columns. So sorted unique elements are 1,2,3,4,8 \u2192 but four elements, maybe the first four:1,2,3,4. Then subsequent rows replace elements from the right.\n\nBut this doesn't explain Example0's output where the first row has three elements which are all the unique elements of the input.\n\nAlternatively, the first row is the sorted unique elements of each column's maximum value. For Example0:\n\ncol0's max is2, col1's max3, col2's max1. Sorted:1,2,3 \u2192 which matches the first row.\n\nExample1:\n\ncol0's max4, col1's max4, col2's max4, col3's max4 \u2192 sorted [4,4,4,4]. But the first row is [4,2,1,3]. Doesn't fit.\n\nThis approach is not working.\n\nAt this point, given the time I've spent and the lack of progress, I'll proceed to the answer based on the assumption that each output row is formed by taking the unique elements of each column, sorted in ascending order, and then each row after the first removes the largest element from the previous row and adds a zero. The number of rows seems to be determined by the maximum number of unique elements in any column plus some repeats.\n\nFor the test input:\n\nColumns' unique elements sorted:\n\ncol0:1,8\n\ncol1:1,3,8\n\ncol2:1,2,3,8\n\ncol3:1,2,4\n\nThe maximum number of unique elements is 4 (column2). So four rows.\n\nRow0: take the first element from each column's sorted unique list \u2192 1,1,1,1 \u2192 [1,1,1,1]\n\nRow1: take the second elements \u2192 8,3,2,2 \u2192 [8,3,2,2]\n\nRow2: take third elements \u2192 0 (col0),8,3,4 \u2192 [0,8,3,4]\n\nRow3: take fourth elements \u2192 0 (col0),0 (col1),8,0 (col3) \u2192 [0,0,8,0]\n\nBut looking at Example0's output, the first row is not the first elements of each column's sorted unique list, but rather all the unique elements of the entire input. So this approach is incorrect.\n\nGiven that I'm unable to determine the exact pattern, I'll have to make a best guess based on the examples. In Example0, the output is the sorted unique elements of the entire input followed by replacing the rightmost elements with zeros in each subsequent row, repeating as needed. For the test input, the sorted unique elements are 1,2,3,4,8. But since there are four columns, perhaps the first row is [1,2,3,4], then each next row replaces the rightmost element with zero:\n\n[1,2,3,4]\n\n[1,2,3,0]\n\n[1,2,0,0]\n\n[1,0,0,0]\n\n[1,0,0,0]\n\n[1,0,0,0]\n\nBut this is a guess and may not match the actual pattern."
