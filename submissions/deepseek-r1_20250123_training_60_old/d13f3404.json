        "cot_1": "Okay, let's see. I need to figure out the pattern that transforms the input matrices into the output matrices. Let me look at the training examples again.\n\nStarting with Example 0. The input is a 3x3 matrix:\n\n[6, 1, 0]\n[3, 0, 0]\n[0, 0, 0]\n\nAnd the output is a 6x6 matrix. Let me look at how each row is constructed. The output rows have a shifting pattern. The first row of the output is [6,1,0,0,0,0], which seems like the first input row followed by three zeros. The second output row is [3,6,1,0,0,0]. Wait, that looks like the second input row's elements are being combined with the first row's elements. Like, the 3 is from the second row's first element, then 6 from the first row's first element, then 1 from the first row's second element. Then zeros. Hmm. Let me check the third output row: [0,3,6,1,0,0]. Here, the first element is 0, then 3 (from second row's first?), then 6, 1. Wait, maybe it's shifted down each time. Let me visualize this.\n\nWait, the output matrix is 6x6, which is double the size of the input 3x3. Maybe each row from the input is being shifted in some diagonal way. Like, each input row is a diagonal in the output matrix. Let's see:\n\nLooking at the output of example 0:\n\nRow 0: 6 1 0 0 0 0 \u2192 maybe the first row of the input is placed here, then zeros.\n\nRow 1: 3 6 1 0 0 0 \u2192 the second row's elements (3,0,0) maybe start here. But where's the 3? The 3 is the first element here, then 6 (from row0's first element?), then 1 (row0's second element), then zeros. Then row2 of output is [0,3,6,1,0,0]. So here, the first element is 0, then 3 (from row1's first?), then 6 (row0's first again?), then 1. This seems like each subsequent row is shifting the elements to the right and adding a new element from the next input row. Wait, maybe it's a convolution or some kind of cascading effect where each output row is built from the input rows shifted by one position each time.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each input row is forming a diagonal in the output matrix. For example, the first input row [6,1,0] is placed along the main diagonal of the output, but then the second input row [3,0,0] is placed along the diagonal starting at position (1,0), and the third input row [0,0,0] is placed even lower. Let's check:\n\nIn Example0's output:\n\nRow0: 6 1 0 0 0 0 \u2192 maybe input row0 elements start at column 0,1,2.\n\nRow1: 3 6 1 0 0 0 \u2192 3 is at (1,0), then 6 (0,0) shifted right? Not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps the output is constructed by shifting each input row down by one row and right by one column each time. For example, the first input row is placed in the output's row 0, starting at column 0. The second input row is placed in output's row 1, starting at column 1. Wait, but in Example0's output row 1, the second input row's first element is 3 at position (1,0), which doesn't fit that. Alternatively, maybe each input row is shifted down by their row index and the columns start at their row index. Let me see.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the output matrices, each row seems to be a shifted combination of the input's rows. Let's take Example0's output rows:\n\nRow0: [6,1,0,0,0,0] \u2192 same as input row0 with padding.\n\nRow1: [3,6,1,0,0,0] \u2192 starts with 3 (input row1[0]), then input row0[0], row0[1], etc.\n\nRow2: [0,3,6,1,0,0] \u2192 starts with 0 (input row2[0]?), then 3 (row1[0]), then 6 (row0[0]), then 1 (row0[1]).\n\nRow3: [0,0,3,6,1,0] \u2192 0,0,3 (row1[0] again?), 6 (row0[0]), 1 (row0[1]).\n\nWait, this seems inconsistent. Maybe each row in the output is a shifted version of the previous, but each element comes from the input rows stacked in a certain way.\n\nAlternatively, think of each input row as a kernel that is being convolved with the output matrix. For example, the first input row is the top kernel, the second is the middle, and the third is the bottom. Then, each output row is built by sliding these kernels down and right.\n\nAnother approach: The output matrix has a size of 2n x 2n where n is the original size. Wait, the input is 3x3, output is 6x6. So 3*2=6. So maybe each row of the output is a combination of the input rows shifted in a way that each input row is staggered.\n\nLooking at Example1's input and output:\n\nInput:\n[0,4,0]\n[0,8,0]\n[2,0,0]\n\nOutput:\n\nRow0: 0 4 0 0 0 0 \u2192 input row0 with padding.\n\nRow1: 0 8 4 0 0 0 \u2192 starts with 0 (input row1[0]), then 8 (row1[1]), then 4 (row0[1]).\n\nRow2: 2 0 8 4 0 0 \u2192 2 (row2[0]), 0 (row2[1]), 8 (row1[1]), 4 (row0[1]).\n\nRow3: 0 2 0 8 4 0 \u2192 0 (maybe row3 doesn't exist, so starts with 0?), then 2 (row2[0]), 0 (row2[1]), 8 (row1[1]), 4 (row0[1]).\n\nWait, this seems a bit confusing. Maybe the pattern is that each row in the output is built by taking elements from the input matrix in a diagonal fashion, shifting down and to the right each time. For example, the first element of each output row comes from the first element of the input rows, shifted by the row index. Let me check.\n\nIn Example0's output:\n\nRow0 starts with 6 (input[0][0]).\n\nRow1 starts with 3 (input[1][0]).\n\nRow2 starts with 0 (input[2][0]).\n\nRow3 starts with 0 (since there's no input row3, perhaps it's 0).\n\nWait, but in Example0's output, row3 starts with 0, then 0, 3, etc. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, the output is constructed by shifting each input row downwards and to the right, such that each row is shifted by one position. Let's see for Example0:\n\nInput rows:\n\nRow0: [6,1,0]\n\nRow1: [3,0,0]\n\nRow2: [0,0,0]\n\nThe output rows are 6 long. Let's see:\n\nRow0 of output: 6,1,0 followed by zeros. So input row0 is placed at the start.\n\nRow1: 3, then 6,1,0 shifted? Wait, 3 is from row1's first element, then 6 from row0's first, then 1 from row0's second. Then zeros. So it's like row1's first element, followed by row0's first three elements, then zeros.\n\nRow2: 0,3,6,1,0,0 \u2192 0 (maybe from row2's first element, which is 0), then 3 (row1's first), 6 (row0's first), 1 (row0's second), then zeros.\n\nRow3: 0,0,3,6,1,0 \u2192 0,0 (padding?), then 3 (row1's first), 6 (row0's first), 1 (row0's second), 0.\n\nRow4: 0,0,0,3,6,1 \u2192 Here, 3 is row1's first element, 6 row0's first, 1 row0's second, but shifted.\n\nWait, maybe each row in the output is a concatenation of elements from the input rows, each shifted by the output row index. For example, output row i takes elements from input row j where j = i - k, but this is getting a bit unclear.\n\nAnother approach: Let's see how the output rows are built in Example0:\n\nThe output has 6 rows. Let's list them:\n\nRow0: 6 1 0 0 0 0 \u2192 input row0 + 3 zeros.\n\nRow1: 3 6 1 0 0 0 \u2192 starts with input row1[0], then input row0[0], input row0[1], then 0.\n\nRow2: 0 3 6 1 0 0 \u2192 starts with 0 (input row2[0] is 0?), then input row1[0], input row0[0], input row0[1].\n\nRow3: 0 0 3 6 1 0 \u2192 starts with two zeros, then input row1[0], input row0[0], input row0[1].\n\nRow4: 0 0 0 3 6 1 \u2192 starts with three zeros, then input row1[0], input row0[0], input row0[1].\n\nRow5: 0 0 0 0 3 6 \u2192 starts with four zeros, then input row1[0], input row0[0].\n\nWait, this doesn't fit. Row5 ends with 3 and 6. But input row1[0] is 3 and row0[0] is 6. So perhaps each output row after the first few is taking elements from input rows, but shifted.\n\nAlternatively, the output is a Toeplitz matrix where each row is a shifted version of the input rows. For instance, the input rows are arranged diagonally.\n\nAlternatively, considering the output as a combination of three Toeplitz matrices, each from an input row. For example, each input row is creating a Toeplitz matrix which is then combined with others shifted vertically and horizontally.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each output row is formed by taking the elements from the input matrix in a diagonal manner, moving down each row and right each column.\n\nLet me think of the output as the input matrix being \"spread out\" with each row shifted to the right. For example, the first input row is placed as the first row of the output, then the second input row is placed starting at column 1 of the second row, and the third input row starts at column 2 of the third row, and so on. But the output has 6 rows, which is twice the input's 3. Maybe each input row is duplicated and shifted.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the output dimensions: input is 3x3, output is 6x6. So maybe each element in the input is being expanded into a 2x2 block. But the examples don't show that. For instance, in Example0, the 6 in the input is present in multiple positions in the output, so that's not the case.\n\nAnother angle: Looking at the output as a lower triangular matrix constructed from the input. Wait, in Example0's output, the 6 in the first row is followed by 1 and 0, then zeros. Then the second row has 3, 6, 1, etc. So perhaps each row is a shifted version of the previous, but with elements taken from the input.\n\nWait, maybe each output row is formed by taking the elements from the input in a diagonal manner. For example, in the output's row i, the elements are taken from the input's rows such that the column j in the output corresponds to input row (i-j) mod 3 or something. But this might need more analysis.\n\nLet's take the first example's output row1: [3,6,1,0,0,0]. The elements are 3 (input row1[0]), 6 (input row0[0]), 1 (input row0[1]). Then zeros.\n\nRow2: [0,3,6,1,0,0]. The elements are 0 (input row2[0]), 3 (input row1[0]), 6 (input row0[0]), 1 (input row0[1]).\n\nRow3: [0,0,3,6,1,0]. 0 (no input?), 0 (no input?), 3 (row1[0]), 6 (row0[0]), 1 (row0[1]).\n\nRow4: [0,0,0,3,6,1]. Three zeros, then 3 (row1[0]), 6 (row0[0]), 1 (row0[1]).\n\nRow5: [0,0,0,0,3,6]. Four zeros, then 3 (row1[0]), 6 (row0[0]).\n\nHmm, this seems to suggest that after the first three rows, the elements from row1[0] and row0[0] continue to shift right. But why?\n\nWait, perhaps each input column is being shifted into the output in a certain pattern. For example, input column0 is [6,3,0], which in the output becomes the diagonal elements starting at row0, then row1, row2, etc., but in the output, the 6 appears in positions (0,0), (1,1), (2,2), etc. But looking at Example0's output:\n\nThe 6 is at (0,0), (1,1), (2,2), (3,3), (4,4), (5,5). But in row1, the 6 is at position (1,1). But looking at row1's elements: 3,6,1,... So 6 is at index 1. So that fits. Similarly, in row2, 6 is at index 2, and so on. So input's column0 elements are placed along the main diagonal. Then input's column1 elements are placed along the diagonal starting at (0,1). Let's check:\n\nInput column1 in Example0 is [1,0,0]. So in the output, row0 has 1 at index1. Row1 has 0 at index2? Wait, row1's column2 is 1. Hmm, maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps each column of the input is placed as a diagonal in the output matrix. For example:\n\nInput column0: [6,3,0] \u2192 in the output, these are placed along the main diagonal (0,0), (1,1), (2,2).\n\nInput column1: [1,0,0] \u2192 placed along the diagonal starting at (0,1), so positions (0,1), (1,2), (2,3), etc.\n\nInput column2: [0,0,0] \u2192 placed along diagonal starting at (0,2), but all are zeros.\n\nSo the output is the sum of these three diagonal matrices. Let's check Example0's output:\n\nRow0: [6,1,0,0,0,0] \u2192 6 at (0,0), 1 at (0,1), 0 at (0,2).\n\nRow1: [3,6,1,0,0,0] \u2192 3 at (1,0) (wait, but according to input column0, row1 should have 3 at (1,1). Hmm, this doesn't fit. So maybe that's not the case.\n\nAlternative idea: The output is generated by stacking shifted versions of the input rows. For example, the first row of the input is placed in the first row of the output. The second row of the input is placed in the second row of the output, shifted right by 1. The third row of the input is placed in the third row of the output, shifted right by 2. Then, after that, the next rows are the input rows shifted further right but starting from lower rows. But the output has 6 rows. Let's see:\n\nIn Example0, input has 3 rows. The output has 6 rows, which is 3 + 3. So maybe after the third row, we start shifting again but with some offset.\n\nAlternatively, each row in the output is a combination of the three input rows, each shifted right by (row index - input row index) * 1. For example:\n\nFor output row i:\n\nelement j is the sum of input[k][j - (i - k)] if j - (i -k) is within the input's column indices.\n\nWait, this is getting complicated, but let's test this for Example0's row1.\n\nRow1 (i=1) would have elements:\n\nFor j=0: possible k where j - (i -k) is in [0,2]. Let's see:\n\nFor k=0: j=0, i=1. So j - (i -k) = 0 - (1-0) = -1 \u2192 invalid.\n\nk=1: j=0 \u2192 0 - (1-1) =0 \u2192 input[1][0] =3 \u2192 element at (1,0) is 3.\n\nk=2: j=0 \u2192 0 - (1-2) =1 \u2192 input[2][1]=0.\n\nSo element (1,0) would be 3 + 0=3, which matches. For j=1:\n\nk=0: 1 - (1-0) =0 \u2192 input[0][0]=6 \u2192 6.\n\nk=1: 1 - (1-1)=1 \u2192 input[1][1]=0 \u2192 0.\n\nk=2: 1 - (1-2) =2 \u2192 input[2][2]=0 \u21920.\n\nSo element (1,1)=6+0+0=6. Which matches. j=2:\n\nk=0: 2 - (1-0)=1 \u2192 input[0][1]=1.\n\nk=1: 2 - (1-1)=2 \u2192 input[1][2]=0.\n\nk=2: 2 - (1-2)=3 \u2192 invalid.\n\nSo element (1,2)=1+0=1. Which matches. Then zeros beyond. So this seems to work.\n\nSimilarly, for row2 (i=2):\n\nj=0:\n\nk=0: 0 - (2-0)= -2 \u2192 invalid.\n\nk=1: j=0 - (2-1) = -1 \u2192 invalid.\n\nk=2: j=0 - (2-2)=0 \u2192 input[2][0]=0.\n\nSo element (2,0)=0.\n\nj=1:\n\nk=0: 1 - (2-0)= -1 \u2192 invalid.\n\nk=1: 1 - (2-1)=0 \u2192 input[1][0]=3.\n\nk=2:1 - (2-2)=1 \u2192 input[2][1]=0.\n\nSo element (2,1)=3+0=3.\n\nj=2:\n\nk=0: 2-2=0 \u2192 input[0][0]=6.\n\nk=1: 2 -1=1 \u2192 input[1][1]=0.\n\nk=2: 2-0=2 \u2192 input[2][2]=0.\n\nSo element (2,2)=6+0+0=6.\n\nj=3:\n\nk=0:3-2=1 \u2192 input[0][1]=1.\n\nk=1:3-1=2 \u2192 input[1][2]=0.\n\nk=2:3-0=3 \u2192 invalid.\n\nSo element (2,3)=1+0=1.\n\nWhich matches the third row of output in Example0: [0,3,6,1,0,0].\n\nThis pattern seems to hold. So the output matrix is constructed such that each element (i,j) in the output is the sum of input[k][j - (i -k)] for all k where j - (i -k) is between 0 and 2 (since the input has 3 columns). Essentially, for each row i in the output, each input row k contributes to element j if j = i -k + m, where m is the column in the input. So for each input row k, the elements are shifted right by (i -k) positions. If that's within the output's column range, they contribute.\n\nIn other words, each output row i is formed by taking each input row k and shifting it right by (i -k) positions, then summing all these shifted rows.\n\nSo the formula for output[i][j] is sum of input[k][j - (i -k)] for all k where 0 <= k < 3 and 0 <= j - (i -k) < 3.\n\nThis seems to fit. Let's test this on Example1.\n\nExample1's input:\n\n[0,4,0]\n[0,8,0]\n[2,0,0]\n\nLet's compute output row 2 (i=2):\n\nFor j=0:\n\nk=0: j - (i -k) =0 - (2-0) =-2 \u2192 invalid.\n\nk=1: 0 - (2-1) =-1 \u2192 invalid.\n\nk=2:0 - (2-2)=0 \u2192 input[2][0] =2.\n\nSo element (2,0)=2.\n\nj=1:\n\nk=0:1 - (2-0)= -1 \u2192 invalid.\n\nk=1:1 - (2-1)=0 \u2192 input[1][0]=0.\n\nk=2:1 -0=1 \u2192 input[2][1]=0.\n\nSo sum is 0+0=0. Wait, but the output row2 is [2,0,8,4,0,0]. Wait, according to this, (2,0)=2, (2,1)=0. But in the actual output, element (2,1) is 0, element (2,2) is 8. Let's check j=2.\n\nj=2:\n\nk=0: 2 - (2-0) =0 \u2192 input[0][0] =0.\n\nk=1:2 - (2-1)=1 \u2192 input[1][1]=8.\n\nk=2:2 -0=2 \u2192 input[2][2]=0.\n\nSum: 0 +8 +0=8 \u2192 which matches the output's (2,2)=8.\n\nSo this works. For j=3:\n\nk=0:3 -2=1 \u2192 input[0][1]=4.\n\nk=1:3 -1=2 \u2192 input[1][2]=0.\n\nk=2:3 -0=3 \u2192 invalid.\n\nSum:4 +0=4 \u2192 matches (2,3)=4.\n\nYes, this seems correct.\n\nTherefore, the pattern is that each element in the output matrix is the sum of the elements from the input matrix where the row k in the input contributes to the output's (i,j) if j = (i -k) + m, where m is the column in the input. So for each k, the input row k is shifted right by (i -k) positions and added to the output row i.\n\nNow, applying this pattern to the test input.\n\nTest Input:\n[0, 0, 3]\n[0, 0, 0]\n[0, 4, 9]\n\nThis is a 3x3 matrix. The output will be a 6x6 matrix. For each output row i (0 to 5), and column j (0 to 5), compute the sum of input[k][j - (i -k)] for k=0,1,2, where j - (i -k) must be between 0 and 2 (inclusive).\n\nLet's compute each row.\n\nFirst, let's note the input rows:\n\nRow0: [0,0,3]\n\nRow1: [0,0,0]\n\nRow2: [0,4,9]\n\nNow, compute each output row:\n\nRow0 (i=0):\n\nFor j=0 to 5.\n\nFor each k in 0,1,2:\n\nj - (0 -k) = j +k.\n\nWe need this to be in 0,1,2.\n\nSo for k=0: j +0 =j \u2192 must be 0,1,2 \u2192 j=0,1,2.\n\nSo input[0][j] for j=0,1,2: 0,0,3.\n\nFor k=1: j +1 must be in 0-2 \u2192 j can be -1,0,1 \u2192 but j >=0 \u2192 j=0,1.\n\ninput[1][j+1] for j=0: input[1][1]=0, j=1: input[1][2]=0.\n\nFor k=2: j+2 must be in 0-2 \u2192 j can be -2,-1,0 \u2192 j=0.\n\ninput[2][0+2=2] =9.\n\nSo for row0:\n\nj=0:\n\nk=0: j=0 \u2192 input[0][0]=0.\n\nk=1: j=0 \u2192 j+1=1 \u2192 input[1][1]=0.\n\nk=2: j=0 \u2192 j+2=2 \u2192 input[2][2]=9.\n\nSum: 0 +0 +9=9.\n\nBut according to the training examples, row0 should start with input row0 followed by zeros. Wait, but according to our pattern, for i=0, the elements are sum of input[k][j - (0 -k)] = input[k][j +k].\n\nBut let's compute each j for i=0:\n\nj=0:\n\nsum input[k][0 +k] for k where 0 +k <=2.\n\nk=0: 0+0=0 \u2192 input[0][0]=0.\n\nk=1: 0+1=1 \u2192 input[1][1]=0.\n\nk=2:0+2=2 \u2192 input[2][2]=9.\n\nsum:0+0+9=9. But in the training examples, the first row of the output is the input row0 followed by zeros. This suggests a discrepancy. Wait, in Example0, the first row is [6,1,0,0,0,0], which is exactly input row0 followed by zeros, but according to this pattern, it would be sum of input[k][j +k], which for j=0: 6 (k=0) +3 (k=1, j+1=1 \u2192 input[1][1]=0) +0 (k=2, j+2=2 \u2192 input[2][2]=0). Wait, in Example0's input row1 is [3,0,0], so input[1][1]=0, but in row0's output j=1 is 1, which comes from input[0][1] (since j=1, k=0 \u2192 j+k=1 \u2192 input[0][1]=1). Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in the formula.\n\nWait, maybe the formula is output[i][j] = sum_{k=0}^{2} input[k][j - (i -k)] if (j - (i -k)) is between 0 and 2.\n\nSo for output[i][j], each input row k contributes to j - (i -k) column.\n\nBut for i=0:\n\nj - (0 -k) = j +k.\n\nSo for example, in row0, j=0:\n\nsum input[k][0 +k] for k=0,1,2.\n\nk=0: input[0][0] =0.\n\nk=1: input[1][1] =0.\n\nk=2: input[2][2] =9.\n\nSum is 9. But according to training examples, in Example0's row0, the first element is 6, which is input[0][0]. But according to this formula, in Example0's row0, j=0 would be input[0][0] (6) + input[1][1] (0) + input[2][2] (0) \u2192 sum 6. Which matches. Then j=1 would be input[0][1] (1) + input[1][2] (0) + input[2][3] (invalid) \u2192 sum 1. j=2: input[0][2] (0) + input[1][3] (invalid) + input[2][4] (invalid) \u2192 0. So row0 would be [6,1,0,0,0,0], which matches. So for Example0, the formula works. For the test case's row0, the sum for j=0 would be 0 (k=0) +0 (k=1) +9 (k=2) \u2192 9. But according to the training examples, the first row of the output is the first input row followed by zeros, but this formula gives a different result. This suggests a contradiction.\n\nWait, but according to the formula, for i=0, j can be 0,1,2 (from k=0), but when k=0, j must be such that j +k <=2. For k=0, j can be 0,1,2. For k=1, j can be 0,1. For k=2, j can be 0. So for each j, you sum all possible k where j +k <=2.\n\nBut in Example0's row0:\n\nj=0: sum k=0,1,2 \u2192 6 (0,0) +0 (1,1) +0 (2,2) =6.\n\nj=1: sum k=0,1 \u2192 input[0][1] (1) + input[1][2] (0) \u21921.\n\nj=2: sum k=0 \u2192 input[0][2] (0).\n\nj=3: no terms \u21920.\n\nThus, row0 is [6,1,0,0,0,0], which matches. So in the test case, for row0:\n\nj=0: 0 (k=0) +0 (k=1) +9 (k=2) \u21929.\n\nj=1: input[0][1] (0) + input[1][2] (0) \u21920.\n\nj=2: input[0][2] (3) \u21923.\n\nj=3-5: 0.\n\nBut according to the training examples, row0 of the output is the input's first row followed by zeros. So this contradicts the formula. Therefore, my initial assumption must be wrong.\n\nHmm, this means that there's a mistake in the pattern explanation. Let me re-examine the examples.\n\nLooking back at Example0's output row0: it's exactly the first input row followed by three zeros. So input row0 is [6,1,0], and the output row0 is [6,1,0,0,0,0]. So it's just the input row0 padded with zeros. Similarly, in Example1's output row0: [0,4,0,0,0,0], which is the first input row [0,4,0] plus zeros. So the first output row is input row0 plus padding. The second output row starts with input row1's first element, then input row0's elements shifted. Then third output row starts with input row2's first element, then input row1's first element, then input row0's elements, etc. Then after that, each subsequent row shifts the previous elements further right.\n\nLooking at Example0's output:\n\nRow0: [6,1,0,0,0,0] \u2192 input row0.\n\nRow1: [3,6,1,0,0,0] \u2192 input row1[0], then input row0[0], input row0[1], and input row0[2] (but 0).\n\nRow2: [0,3,6,1,0,0] \u2192 input row2[0], then input row1[0], input row0[0], input row0[1].\n\nRow3: [0,0,3,6,1,0] \u2192 0, then input row2[0], input row1[0], input row0[0], input row0[1].\n\nWait, but row3 has 0,0,3,6,1,0. So the pattern seems to be that each row after the first three shifts the previous row's elements to the right, adding a zero at the start. For example, row3 is like row2 shifted right by one, but with 0 at the start. But this doesn't fit exactly. Alternatively, it's a diagonal shift where each element from input row k is placed in the output row i=k + m, shifted by m positions. For example, input row0's elements are placed in output rows starting at row0, shifted by 0,1,2, etc., but this needs more analysis.\n\nAlternatively, think of each input row as a diagonal in the output matrix. For example:\n\nInput row0 forms the main diagonal: (0,0), (1,1), (2,2), (3,3), etc.\n\nInput row1 forms the diagonal starting at (1,0), (2,1), (3,2), etc.\n\nInput row2 forms the diagonal starting at (2,0), (3,1), (4,2), etc.\n\nBut in Example0's output, row1 has 3 at (1,0), which fits row1's first element (3) in input row1. Then row2 has 3 at (2,1), which is input row1's first element again. Hmm, this seems to form a lower diagonal structure.\n\nBut then in Example0's output:\n\nThe main diagonal (0,0), (1,1), etc. has 6,6,6,6,6,6? No. In row1, the (1,1) is 6, row2 (2,2) is6, etc. So yes, input row0's elements are placed along the main diagonal. Input row1's elements are placed along the diagonal starting at (1,0). Input row2's elements are placed along the diagonal starting at (2,0).\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nIn Example0, input row0 is [6,1,0]. The main diagonal of the output is 6,6,6,6,6,6. But input row0's first element is 6, the rest are 1 and 0. So this doesn't fit. So perhaps each element of input row0 is placed along their respective diagonals.\n\nAlternatively, each input row is shifted down by their row index and to the right by their column index. For example, input[0][0] is at (0,0), input[0][1] is at (0,1), etc. Input[1][0] is at (1,0), input[1][1] at (1,1), etc. But this would just be the input matrix padded, which doesn't explain the output.\n\nAlternatively, each input row is shifted down by their row index and to the right by their row index. For example, row0 is shifted down 0 and right 0 \u2192 starts at (0,0). Row1 shifted down 1 and right 0 \u2192 starts at (1,0). Row2 shifted down 2 and right 0 \u2192 starts at (2,0). Then, each row's elements are placed in the output starting at that position, and the rest is filled with zeros. But the output has more rows. So perhaps after placing the input rows, the output is extended with additional rows that are shifted versions of the lower rows.\n\nBut this is getting too vague. Maybe I should try to find a different approach.\n\nLooking at Example0's output again:\n\nThe output has 6 rows. The first three rows start with input row0, row1, row2 elements, but then the next three rows are shifted versions of the previous ones. For example:\n\nRow3: [0,0,3,6,1,0] \u2192 which is like row2 shifted right by one, with a zero at the start.\n\nRow4: [0,0,0,3,6,1] \u2192 row3 shifted right by one, etc.\n\nRow5: [0,0,0,0,3,6] \u2192 row4 shifted right by one.\n\nSo, the output seems to be generated by:\n\n1. Place each input row in the first three rows of the output, shifted right by their row index.\n\n2. Then, for each subsequent row, shift the previous row right by one and add a zero at the beginning.\n\nBut how does this fit the examples?\n\nIn Example0:\n\nInput row0 [6,1,0] \u2192 output row0: [6,1,0,0,0,0].\n\nInput row1 [3,0,0] \u2192 output row1: [3,0,0,0,0,0], but the actual row1 is [3,6,1,0,0,0]. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternative idea: Each output row is created by taking elements from the input matrix's columns, with each column shifted down by their index. For example, column0 elements are shifted down by 0, column1 by 1, column2 by 2. Then, each output row is the sum of the shifted columns. Let's see:\n\nIn Example0's input:\n\nColumn0: [6,3,0]\n\nColumn1: [1,0,0]\n\nColumn2: [0,0,0]\n\nShifting column0 down by 0: [6,3,0,0,0,0].\n\nShifting column1 down by 1: [0,1,0,0,0,0].\n\nShifting column2 down by 2: [0,0,0,0,0,0].\n\nSumming these gives each row. But this doesn't seem to match the output.\n\nAlternatively, the output matrix is built by placing each input column as a diagonal, starting at row i for column i. For example, column0 starts at row0, column1 starts at row1, etc. Then, each element is placed along the diagonal. Let's see for Example0's column0: [6,3,0] \u2192 placed at (0,0), (1,0), (2,0). Column1: [1,0,0] \u2192 placed at (0,1), (1,1), (2,1). Column2: [0,0,0] \u2192 placed at (0,2), (1,2), (2,2). But the output matrix has elements beyond these positions. So this doesn't explain it.\n\nAnother observation: The output matrices in the examples have each row i equal to the concatenation of the input's row i mod 3, shifted right by floor(i/3). For example, in Example0:\n\nOutput row0: input row0 shifted 0 \u2192 [6,1,0,0,0,0].\n\nRow1: input row1 shifted 0 \u2192 [3,0,0,0,0,0], but actual row1 is [3,6,1,0,0,0]. Doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, each output row is a combination of the previous rows, but I'm not seeing it.\n\nLet's try to find the pattern for the Test Input:\n\nTest Input:\n\n[0,0,3]\n\n[0,0,0]\n\n[0,4,9]\n\nExpected output is a 6x6 matrix. According to the examples, the output should start with the first input row, then the second row shifted and combined with elements from the first, and so on.\n\nLet's try to manually construct the output based on the examples.\n\nLooking at Example0's output:\n\nRow0: input row0 + zeros.\n\nRow1: input row1's first element, then input row0's first three elements.\n\nRow2: input row2's first element, input row1's first element, input row0's first two elements.\n\nRow3: zero, input row2's first element, input row1's first element, input row0's first three elements shifted.\n\nWait, maybe each row after the first three continues to shift the previous elements to the right and down.\n\nAlternatively, the output is formed by shifting each input row down by its row index and to the right by its row index. Then, each subsequent row shifts the previous elements further.\n\nBut perhaps the pattern is that each output row i contains elements from input rows i, i-1, i-2, etc., shifted appropriately.\n\nAlternatively, considering the output as a lower triangular matrix where each diagonal is formed by the input rows.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and the need to find a solution, perhaps I should look for the pattern in the training examples and try to replicate it for the test input.\n\nLooking at the output rows in the examples:\n\nExample0's output:\n\nRow0: input row0 followed by zeros.\n\nRow1: input row1's first element, followed by input row0's elements, then zeros.\n\nRow2: input row2's first element, followed by input row1's first element, then input row0's elements.\n\nRow3: 0, followed by input row2's first element, then input row1's first element, then input row0's elements.\n\nRow4: 0, 0, input row2's first element, input row1's first element, input row0's first elements.\n\nRow5: 0,0,0, input row2's first element, input row1's first element, input row0's first element.\n\nWait, this seems to fit. For example, in Example0:\n\nRow3: [0,0,3,6,1,0] \u2192 0,0,3 (input row2's first element), 6 (input row0's first element), 1 (input row0's second), 0 (input row0's third).\n\nWait, but input row0's first element is 6, which is at position 3 here. Hmm, perhaps it's a diagonal shift where each row shifts the previous elements to the right and adds a new element from the next input row.\n\nAlternatively, each output row is built by taking the first element from the corresponding input row, then the first element from the previous input row, and so on, and padding with zeros. But this may not fit.\n\nAlternatively, each output row is a concatenation of the input rows' elements, staggered in a way that each input row starts one column later than the previous.\n\nFor example:\n\nRow0: input row0 elements followed by zeros.\n\nRow1: input row1[0], then input row0 elements, then zeros.\n\nRow2: input row2[0], then input row1[0], then input row0 elements.\n\nRow3: 0, then input row2[0], then input row1[0], then input row0 elements.\n\nRow4: 0, 0, input row2[0], input row1[0], input row0[0], input row0[1].\n\nRow5: 0,0,0, input row2[0], input row1[0], input row0[0].\n\nThis seems to fit Example0's output:\n\nRow0: [6,1,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow1: [3,6,1,0,0,0] \u2192 3 (row1[0]), 6 (row0[0]), 1 (row0[1]), 0 (row0[2]).\n\nRow2: [0,3,6,1,0,0] \u2192 0 (row2[0]), 3 (row1[0]), 6 (row0[0]), 1 (row0[1]).\n\nRow3: [0,0,3,6,1,0] \u2192 0, 0 (since row3 has no corresponding input row), 3 (row2[0]), 6 (row1[0]), 1 (row0[0]), 0 (row0[1])?\n\nWait, this doesn't align. Maybe there's a pattern where each row after the third continues to shift the elements from the input rows.\n\nAlternatively, each output row is built by taking the first element from the input row i-0, then from i-1, then i-2, etc., but only if they exist.\n\nFor example:\n\nOutput row i is constructed as follows:\n\nelements = []\n\nfor k in 0 to i:\n\n   if (i -k) < 3 (input rows are 0,1,2):\n\n       elements.append(input[i -k][k])\n\n   else:\n\n       elements.append(0)\n\nThen, pad with zeros to make the length 6.\n\nBut let's test this for Example0's row1 (i=1):\n\nk=0: input[1-0][0] = input[1][0] =3.\n\nk=1: input[1-1][1] = input[0][1] =1.\n\nelements = [3,1]. But the row has [3,6,1,0,0,0]. Doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for output row i, each element j is input[j][i-j] if i-j is between 0 and 2.\n\nFor example, in Example0's row1 (i=1):\n\nj=0: input[0][1-0=1] \u2192 input[0][1] =1.\n\nj=1: input[1][1-1=0] \u2192 input[1][0] =3.\n\nBut this would give elements [1,3], which doesn't fit.\n\nHmm, I'm stuck. Let's try to find a pattern based on the training examples.\n\nIn Example0:\n\nInput rows:\n\n[6,1,0]\n\n[3,0,0]\n\n[0,0,0]\n\nOutput rows:\n\nRow0: 6 1 0 0 0 0 \u2192 input row0.\n\nRow1:3 6 1 0 0 0 \u2192 input row1[0], input row0[0], input row0[1], input row0[2].\n\nRow2:0 3 6 1 0 0 \u2192 input row2[0], input row1[0], input row0[0], input row0[1].\n\nRow3:0 0 3 6 1 0 \u2192 0, input row2[0], input row1[0], input row0[0], input row0[1].\n\nRow4:0 0 0 3 6 1 \u2192 0,0, input row2[0], input row1[0], input row0[0], input row0[1].\n\nRow5:0 0 0 0 3 6 \u2192 0,0,0, input row2[0], input row1[0], input row0[0].\n\nWait, this seems to show that each output row after the first three is taking input elements from previous rows but shifting them right each time.\n\nFor example, row3 has the same elements as row2 shifted right by one, but starting with 0.\n\nRow4 is row3 shifted right again.\n\nRow5 is row4 shifted right again.\n\nSo the pattern is:\n\n- The first three rows are built from the input rows, with each row combining elements from previous input rows.\n\n- The next three rows are right-shifted versions of the previous rows.\n\nSo for the Test Input:\n\nInput rows:\n\nRow0: [0,0,3]\n\nRow1: [0,0,0]\n\nRow2: [0,4,9]\n\nFollowing the same pattern:\n\nRow0 of output is input row0: [0,0,3,0,0,0].\n\nRow1: input row1[0] (0), then input row0[0] (0), input row0[1] (0), input row0[2] (3) \u2192 [0,0,0,3,0,0].\n\nBut according to the training examples, row1 starts with the input row1's first element, then input row0's elements. So for Example1's input row1 is [0,8,0], and row1 of the output is [0,8,4,0,0,0]. Here, input row1's first element is 0, then input row0's elements (0,4,0) would start at position 1. But in Example1's output row1, it's [0,8,4,0,0,0]. So input row1's second element (8) is included. This contradicts the previous assumption.\n\nWait, in Example1:\n\nInput row0: [0,4,0]\n\nInput row1: [0,8,0]\n\nInput row2: [2,0,0]\n\nOutput row1: [0,8,4,0,0,0].\n\nThis seems to be input row1's first element (0) followed by input row0's first two elements (4,0). But that doesn't fit. Wait, row1 of output starts with 0 (row1[0]), then 8 (row1[1]), then 4 (row0[1]).\n\nHmm, perhaps the output row1 is combining input row1 and row0, but shifted.\n\nLooking back, maybe each output row i is constructed by taking elements from input rows in a way that for each position j in the output row, it takes the element from input row (i-j) and column j. If (i-j) is negative or >=3, then 0.\n\nFor example, for output row i, column j:\n\nif (i-j) is between 0 and 2 (input row indices), then output[i][j] = input[i-j][j].\n\nElse, 0.\n\nLet's test this for Example0's row1 (i=1):\n\nj=0: i-j=1-0=1 \u2192 input[1][0]=3.\n\nj=1:1-1=0 \u2192 input[0][1]=1.\n\nj=2:1-2=-1 \u21920.\n\nj=3:1-3=-2 \u21920.\n\nSo output row1: [3,1,0,0,0,0]. But in Example0, row1 is [3,6,1,0,0,0], which doesn't match. So this is incorrect.\n\nAlternative formula: For output[i][j], it's the sum of input[k][j - (i -k)] for each k where j - (i -k) is between 0 and 2.\n\nWhich is the same formula as before. Let's compute the test case's output using this formula.\n\nTest Input:\n\nRow0: [0,0,3]\n\nRow1: [0,0,0]\n\nRow2: [0,4,9]\n\nLet's compute each output row:\n\nFor each i from 0 to 5:\n\nFor each j from 0 to 5:\n\noutput[i][j] = sum of input[k][j - (i -k)] for k=0,1,2 where j - (i -k) is >=0 and <=2.\n\nLet's compute row0 (i=0):\n\nFor j=0:\n\nk=0: j - (0-0) =0 \u2192 input[0][0]=0.\n\nk=1: j - (0-1)=1+1=1 \u2192 input[1][1]=0.\n\nk=2: j - (0-2)=0+2=2 \u2192 input[2][2]=9.\n\nSum:0+0+9=9.\n\nBut according to the training examples, row0 should be [0,0,3,0,0,0]. So this formula gives 9 at j=0, which doesn't match. This suggests that the formula is incorrect.\n\nThis indicates that my initial pattern assumption is wrong. I must have made a mistake in the analysis.\n\nBack to the training examples. Let's look at Example2:\n\nInput:\n\n[0,0,6]\n\n[1,3,0]\n\n[0,0,0]\n\nOutput:\n\n[0,0,6,0,0,0]\n\n[1,3,0,6,0,0]\n\n[0,1,3,0,6,0]\n\n[0,0,1,3,0,6]\n\n[0,0,0,1,3,0]\n\n[0,0,0,0,1,3]\n\nObserving the output rows:\n\nRow0: input row0.\n\nRow1: input row1 followed by input row0's elements.\n\nRow2: input row2 (which is [0,0,0]) starts with 0, then input row1's elements, then input row0's elements.\n\nRow3: 0, input row2's elements (0,0,0) \u2192 but no, row3 is [0,0,1,3,0,6]. Hmm, this doesn't fit. Alternatively, each output row after the first includes elements from the previous input rows shifted right.\n\nIn Example2's output:\n\nRow1: [1,3,0,6,0,0]. So it's input row1 ([1,3,0]) followed by input row0's first element (6), then zeros.\n\nRow2: [0,1,3,0,6,0]. Starts with 0, then input row1, then input row0's first element (6).\n\nRow3: [0,0,1,3,0,6]. Starts with two zeros, then input row1, then input row0's first element (6) shifted further.\n\nRow4: [0,0,0,1,3,0]. Three zeros, then input row1's first two elements.\n\nRow5: [0,0,0,0,1,3]. Four zeros, then input row1's first two elements.\n\nThis suggests that after the first row, each subsequent row shifts the elements from the previous input rows to the right, adding a zero at the beginning. \n\nThe pattern seems to be:\n\n- The first output row is input row0 followed by zeros.\n\n- The second output row starts with input row1's first element, followed by input row1's second and third elements, then input row0's first element, then zeros.\n\n- The third output row starts with input row2's first element, followed by input row1's first and second elements, then input row0's first element, then zeros.\n\n- For each subsequent row, the elements from the input rows are shifted right by one, and zeros are added at the beginning.\n\nBut how does this apply when input row2 has elements?\n\nIn Example2, input row2 is [0,0,0], so the third output row starts with 0, then input row1's first and second elements (1,3), then input row0's first element (6), then zeros.\n\nThen, each following row shifts the previous elements right by one.\n\nApplying this pattern to the Test Input:\n\nTest Input:\n\nRow0: [0,0,3]\n\nRow1: [0,0,0]\n\nRow2: [0,4,9]\n\nFollowing the pattern:\n\nRow0 of output: [0,0,3,0,0,0].\n\nRow1: starts with row1's first element (0), followed by row1's elements (0,0), then row0's first element (0), then zeros. So [0,0,0,0,0,0], but looking at Example1's row1, which is [0,8,4,0,0,0], perhaps row1 should be row1's elements followed by row0's elements. But in Example1, row1 is [0,8,0] \u2192 row1 of output is [0,8,4,0,0,0], which is row1's elements followed by row0's elements (4 from row0[1]).\n\nWait, this is confusing. Let's think differently.\n\nIn Example0's output:\n\nRow1 is [3,6,1,0,0,0], which is input row1's first element (3) followed by input row0's elements (6,1,0).\n\nIn Example1's output:\n\nRow1 is [0,8,4,0,0,0], which is input row1's elements (0,8,0) followed by input row0's elements (4,0). But it's not exactly followed, since input row0 is [0,4,0].\n\nWait, perhaps row1 of the output is input row1 followed by input row0, but truncated to fit the output row length.\n\nFor example, in Example0:\n\ninput row1 is [3,0,0], input row0 is [6,1,0]. Row1 output has [3,6,1,0,0,0], which is input row1's first element followed by input row0's elements.\n\nSimilarly, in Example1's row1: input row1 is [0,8,0], input row0 is [0,4,0]. So row1 output is [0,8,4,0,0,0], which is input row1's first two elements (0,8) followed by input row0's first element (4).\n\nBut this doesn't fit a consistent pattern. Hmm.\n\nAnother observation: The output matrix's non-zero elements form a lower triangular matrix where each diagonal is formed by the input matrix's columns. For example, input column0 is placed as the main diagonal, column1 as the diagonal starting at (0,1), column2 as (0,2), etc. But this doesn't fit the examples.\n\nAlternatively, the output matrix is created by vertically stacking shifted versions of the input matrix's rows. For example:\n\nThe first three rows are the input rows padded with zeros.\n\nThe next three rows are the input rows shifted right by one and padded with zeros.\n\nBut this doesn't fit Example0's output.\n\nAlternatively, each row in the output is a shifted version of the previous row, with the new element coming from the next input row.\n\nBut given the time I've spent and the need to produce an answer, I'll proceed to apply the pattern observed in the examples to the test input.\n\nFor the Test Input:\n\nInput rows are:\n\nRow0: [0,0,3]\n\nRow1: [0,0,0]\n\nRow2: [0,4,9]\n\nFollowing the pattern seen in the training examples:\n\n- The first output row is input row0 padded with zeros: [0,0,3,0,0,0].\n\n- The second output row starts with input row1's first element (0), followed by input row0's elements: 0,0,3. So row1 would be [0,0,0,3,0,0].\n\nBut looking at Example0's row1, which is input row1's first element followed by input row0's elements. So in Test Input's row1, it should be [0 (from row1[0]), 0 (row0[0]), 0 (row0[1]), 3 (row0[2]), 0, 0]. So row1: [0,0,0,3,0,0].\n\n- The third output row starts with input row2's first element (0), followed by input row1's elements (0,0,0), followed by input row0's elements (0,0,3). But since the row has only 6 elements, it would be [0,0,0,0,3,0].\n\nWait, but in Example0's row2, it's [0,3,6,1,0,0]. Which is input row2's first element (0), then input row1's first element (3), then input row0's first two elements (6,1).\n\nFollowing that pattern, Test Input's row2 should be [0 (row2[0]), row1[0] (0), row0[0] (0), row0[1] (0), row0[2] (3), 0]. So [0,0,0,0,3,0].\n\nBut in the training examples, after row2, the subsequent rows shift right and add zeros. For example, Example0's row3 is [0,0,3,6,1,0], which is row2 shifted right by one and a zero added at the start. Similarly, Test Input's row3 would be [0,0,0,0,0,3], row4 would be [0,0,0,0,0,0], and row5 would be all zeros. But this doesn't fit the pattern observed in the examples.\n\nAlternatively, after row2, the subsequent rows continue to shift the elements from previous rows, but now including input row2's elements.\n\nFor example, in Test Input's row3: start with 0, then input row2's elements (0,4,9), but how?\n\nThis approach isn't working. Given the time constraints, I'll proceed to construct the output based on the pattern observed in the training examples, even if my understanding isn't complete.\n\nTest Input:\n\nRow0: [0,0,3]\n\nRow1: [0,0,0]\n\nRow2: [0,4,9]\n\nFollowing Example0's pattern:\n\nOutput row0: [0,0,3,0,0,0].\n\nOutput row1: [0 (row1[0]), 0 (row0[0]), 0 (row0[1]), 3 (row0[2]), 0, 0].\n\nOutput row2: [0 (row2[0]), 0 (row1[0]), 0 (row0[0]), 0 (row0[1]), 3 (row0[2]), 0].\n\nOutput row3: [0, 0 (row2[0]), 0 (row1[0]), 0 (row0[0]), 0 (row0[1]), 3 (row0[2])].\n\nOutput row4: [0, 0, 0 (row2[0]), 0 (row1[0]), 0 (row0[0]), 0 (row0[1])].\n\nOutput row5: [0,0,0,0 (row2[0]), 0 (row1[0]), 0 (row0[0])].\n\nBut this doesn't account for row2's elements beyond the first. For example, in row2 of the input, the second and third elements are 4 and 9. According to the training examples, these should appear in the output.\n\nLooking back at Example2, the input row2 is [0,0,0], but the output row2 is [0,1,3,0,6,0], which includes elements from row1 and row0. However, in the Test Input, row2 has [0,4,9]. Following Example2's pattern, row2 of the output would start with 0 (input row2[0]), then input row1's elements (0,0,0), then input row0's elements (0,0,3). So row2 would be [0,0,0,0,0,3], but this doesn't match Example2's structure.\n\nAlternatively, in Example2's row2, the output is [0,1,3,0,6,0], which is 0 (row2[0]), then input row1's elements (1,3,0), then input row0's elements (6,0,0). So perhaps each output row after row0 includes the previous input rows shifted.\n\nFor Test Input's row2: [0,4,9].\n\nRow2's output would start with 0 (row2[0]), then input row1's elements (0,0,0), then input row0's elements (0,0,3). So row2's output would be [0,0,0,0,0,3], but this doesn't fit the structure where previous elements are shifted.\n\nThis is getting too confusing. Given the time I've invested and the need to provide an answer, I'll try to replicate the pattern observed in the examples:\n\n- Each output row i is formed by taking the input row i if i <3, then shifting and combining previous input rows for i >=3.\n\nBut since the Test Input's row2 is [0,4,9], which isn't all zeros, this may change the output.\n\nAlternative approach based on Example0's structure:\n\nExample0's output for row0 is input row0.\n\nRow1: input row1[0], input row0[0], input row0[1], input row0[2].\n\nRow2: input row2[0], input row1[0], input row0[0], input row0[1].\n\nRow3: 0, input row2[0], input row1[0], input row0[0], input row0[1].\n\nRow4: 0,0, input row2[0], input row1[0], input row0[0].\n\nRow5: 0,0,0, input row2[0], input row1[0].\n\nApplying this pattern to the Test Input:\n\nRow0: [0,0,3,0,0,0].\n\nRow1: [0 (input row1[0]), 0 (input row0[0]), 0 (input row0[1]), 3 (input row0[2]), 0,0].\n\nRow2: [0 (input row2[0]), 0 (input row1[0]), 0 (input row0[0]), 0 (input row0[1]), 3 (input row0[2]), 0].\n\nRow3: [0, 0 (input row2[0]), 0 (input row1[0]), 0 (input row0[0]), 0 (input row0[1]), 3 (input row0[2])].\n\nRow4: [0,0,0 (input row2[0]), 0 (input row1[0]), 0 (input row0[0]), 0 (input row0[1])].\n\nRow5: [0,0,0,0 (input row2[0]), 0 (input row1[0]), 0 (input row0[0])].\n\nBut this ignores the input row2's elements beyond the first (4 and 9). So this must be incorrect.\n\nWait, in the Test Input, row2 is [0,4,9]. So according to the pattern observed in Example0 and Example2, these elements should appear in the output.\n\nFor example, in Example2, input row1 is [1,3,0], which appears in the output rows.\n\nSo for Test Input's row2 elements, the 4 and 9 should be included.\n\nLooking at Example2's output:\n\nRow2: [0,1,3,0,6,0]. Here, 1 and 3 are from input row1, and 6 is from input row0.\n\nBut in Test Input's row2, the elements are 0,4,9. How do these fit into the output?\n\nMaybe the output's row2 includes input row2's elements in positions beyond the first.\n\nAlternatively, the pattern is that each output row i consists of the elements from the input rows shifted such that each input row k contributes to the output row i starting at column (i -k).\n\nFor example, input row0 contributes to output columns i-0, input row1 to i-1, etc., if within the column range.\n\nThis would align with the formula output[i][j] = input[k][j - (i -k)] for valid j - (i -k).\n\nLet's recompute the Test Input's output using this formula.\n\nTest Input:\n\nRow0: [0,0,3]\n\nRow1: [0,0,0]\n\nRow2: [0,4,9]\n\nCompute output row0 (i=0):\n\nFor j=0: sum input[k][0 +k] for k=0,1,2.\n\nk=0: j=0 \u2192 input[0][0] =0.\n\nk=1: j=0+1=1 \u2192 input[1][1]=0.\n\nk=2: j=0+2=2 \u2192 input[2][2]=9.\n\nSum:0+0+9=9. So output[0][0] =9.\n\nBut according to the examples, row0 should be [0,0,3,0,0,0]. This suggests the formula is incorrect.\n\nTherefore, this approach isn't working. Given the time I've spent and the need to provide an answer, I'll proceed to hypothesize that the output is built by placing each input row as a diagonal in the output matrix, shifted by their row index. For example:\n\n- Input row0 is placed starting at (0,0).\n\n- Input row1 is placed starting at (1,0).\n\n- Input row2 is placed starting at (2,0).\n\nThen, each subsequent row is a shifted version of the previous.\n\nThus, for the Test Input:\n\nRow0: [0,0,3,0,0,0].\n\nRow1: [0,0,0,3,0,0].\n\nRow2: [0,4,9,0,3,0].\n\nRow3: [0,0,4,9,0,3].\n\nRow4: [0,0,0,4,9,0].\n\nRow5: [0,0,0,0,4,9].\n\nBut this doesn't match the training examples.\n\nAnother possibility is that each row in the output is the previous row shifted right by one, with new elements added from the input rows. However, without more time to explore, I'll proceed with the following answer based on the closest pattern I can discern.",

        "cot_2": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. So, the input is a 3x3 matrix, and the output is a 6x6 matrix. Let me look at the training examples to see how they transformed the input into the output.\n\nStarting with Example 0:\nInput:\n[6, 1, 0]\n[3, 0, 0]\n[0, 0, 0]\n\nOutput is a 6x6 matrix. Let me see how each row of the output is formed. The first row of the output is [6,1,0,0,0,0]. Then the second row starts with 3, then 6,1,0,0,0. The third row starts with 0,3,6,1,0,0. Hmm, it looks like each subsequent row is shifted to the right by one, and the elements from the input are somehow being arranged diagonally. Wait, maybe each row in the input matrix is being shifted diagonally in the output matrix.\n\nAnother observation: The output matrix is larger, so perhaps each row of the input is placed in the output such that each element from the input row is placed along a diagonal, and then shifted down and right in subsequent rows. For example, in Example 0, the first input row [6,1,0] starts at position (0,0), then the next row starts at (1,0) but the first element is 3 from the second input row, then 6 from the first input row shifts right. Wait, maybe each input row is shifted diagonally, and the output rows are built by combining these shifted diagonals.\n\nLooking at Example 1's input:\n[0,4,0]\n[0,8,0]\n[2,0,0]\n\nThe output starts with [0,4,0,0,0,0], then next row is [0,8,4,0,0,0]. Here, the 4 from the first input row moves to the third position in the second output row. The third row starts with 2 (from third input row), then 0 (from second input row's second element?), 8, 4. Wait, maybe each element in the input is being placed along a diagonal in the output, and each subsequent row shifts the elements to the right.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output matrix is formed by taking each row of the input and creating a diagonal for each. Let's think of the input as three separate rows, each contributing to a diagonal in the output. For example, the first row of the input might form a diagonal starting at the top-left, then each next row starts one position lower. Then, the output rows are the sum of these diagonals? Or perhaps arranged such that each input row's elements are placed along a diagonal, and each output row is built by combining these elements with shifting.\n\nWait, looking at Example 0's output:\n\nRow 0: [6,1,0,0,0,0] \u2192 this is the first input row followed by zeros.\n\nRow 1: [3,6,1,0,0,0] \u2192 starts with 3 (from second input row's first element), then 6,1 from the first input row.\n\nRow 2: [0,3,6,1,0,0] \u2192 starts with 0, then 3 (second row's first element shifted right), then 6,1 from first row shifted further.\n\nRow 3: [0,0,3,6,1,0] \u2192 now 3 is shifted again, followed by 6 and 1.\n\nHmm, this looks like each input row is being shifted down and to the right as we go down the output rows. The first input row [6,1,0] is placed in the first row of the output, then in the second row shifted right by one (so starts at position 1), but then the second input row [3,0,0] is placed starting at the first element of the second output row. Wait, maybe each input row is arranged as a diagonal in the output, and each subsequent output row combines elements from the input rows shifted appropriately.\n\nAnother approach: The output matrix is a Toeplitz matrix where each row is a shifted version of the previous. But how are the input rows used here?\n\nLooking at the output matrix in Example 0, the first column is [6,3,0,0,0,0], which is the first element of each input row (6 from first row, 3 from second, 0 from third). Then the second column starts with 1, then 6 (from first input row's second element?), 3 (from second row's first element?), etc. Wait, maybe each column of the output is built from the elements of the input in a certain way.\n\nAlternatively, let's look at the positions in the output. For example, in Example 0's output:\n\nThe (0,0) is 6 \u2192 input[0][0]\n\n(1,0) is 3 \u2192 input[1][0]\n\n(2,0) is 0 \u2192 input[2][0]\n\n(1,1) is 6 \u2192 input[0][0]\n\n(2,1) is 3 \u2192 input[1][0]\n\n(3,2) is 3 \u2192 input[1][0] again?\n\nWait, perhaps the elements from the input are arranged such that each element input[i][j] is placed in the output matrix at positions (i + k, j + k) for k = 0,1,2,... such that the positions stay within the 6x6 matrix. Then, each element from the input is spread diagonally down-right.\n\nFor example, input[0][0] = 6 would be at (0,0), (1,1), (2,2), (3,3), (4,4), (5,5). But in the output of Example 0, the 6s are at positions (0,0), (1,1), (2,2), etc. But looking at the first row of the output: [6,1,0,0,0,0]. So the 6 is at (0,0), then 1 at (0,1), which is input[0][1], then 0 at (0,2). So perhaps each element of the input is placed along a diagonal starting at their original row and column in the input, and extended into the output matrix.\n\nSo for each element in the input matrix at position (i,j), in the output matrix, it's placed along the diagonal (i + k, j + k) for k=0,1,... until the indices exceed the 6x6 size.\n\nBut let's check Example 0:\n\nInput rows are:\n\nRow 0: [6,1,0]\n\nRow 1: [3,0,0]\n\nRow 2: [0,0,0]\n\nIn the output, the first row is [6,1,0,0,0,0] \u2192 elements from input row 0.\n\nSecond output row: [3,6,1,0,0,0]. So 3 is from input row 1, column 0. Then 6 is from input row 0, column 0 (but shifted right by 1?), but that doesn't fit. Alternatively, maybe each output row is a combination of the input rows shifted in a certain way.\n\nAlternatively, each output row is formed by taking the input rows and shifting them right by the row index. For example, output row 0 is input row 0 shifted 0 times. Output row 1: input row 1 shifted 0 times, then input row 0 shifted 1 time. Output row 2: input row 2 shifted 0 times, input row 1 shifted 1 time, input row 0 shifted 2 times. And so on, until the output rows are filled by combining shifted versions of the input rows.\n\nLet me test this idea with Example 0:\n\nInput rows:\n\nRow0: [6,1,0]\n\nRow1: [3,0,0]\n\nRow2: [0,0,0]\n\nOutput rows are 6 rows. For each output row i (0-5), it's a combination of input rows shifted by (i - input_row) positions. Wait, maybe output row i is built by taking input row (i - k) shifted by k positions, for k from 0 to 2 (since there are 3 input rows). Let me see.\n\nFor output row 0:\n\ni=0. For k=0: input row 0 shifted 0 \u2192 [6,1,0,0,0,0]. Then k=1 would be input row -1 (invalid), so maybe only k from 0 to i. Hmm, this might not fit.\n\nAnother approach: The output is generated by stacking shifted versions of the input rows, each shifted by one more position than the previous. For instance:\n\nThe first output row is input row 0 shifted 0.\n\nSecond output row is input row 1 shifted 0, then input row 0 shifted 1.\n\nThird output row is input row 2 shifted 0, input row 1 shifted 1, input row 0 shifted 2.\n\nFourth output row would be input row 2 shifted 1, input row 1 shifted 2, input row 0 shifted 3.\n\nWait, but the input has three rows. Let's see for Example 0's output row 3: [0,0,3,6,1,0]. Let's see:\n\nIf output row 3 is formed by input row 2 shifted 0 (since 3-3=0?), input row 1 shifted 1 (3-2=1?), input row 0 shifted 2 (3-1=2?). But input row 2 is [0,0,0], shifted 0 is [0,0,0,0,0,0]. Input row 1 shifted 1: [0,3,0,0,0,0]. Input row 0 shifted 2: [0,0,6,1,0,0]. Adding them together: 0 + 0 + 0 = 0 for first element? Not matching. Alternatively, maybe it's the sum of these shifted rows. But in Example 0's row 3, the elements are 0,0,3,6,1,0. Let's see:\n\nIf input row 0 shifted 3 positions: [0,0,0,6,1,0] (since shifted by 3 \u2192 6 starts at index 3). Input row 1 shifted 2: [0,0,3,0,0,0]. Input row 2 shifted 1: [0,0,0,0,0,0]. Adding them together: 0+0+0=0 (first element), 0+0+0=0 (second), 0+3+0=3 (third), 6+0+0=6 (fourth), etc. So the sum would be [0,0,3,6,1,0], which matches the third output row. But how does this apply to the other rows?\n\nFor output row 0:\n\nOnly input row 0 shifted 0: [6,1,0,0,0,0] \u2192 matches.\n\nOutput row 1:\n\nInput row 1 shifted 0: [3,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nInput row 0 shifted 1: [0,6,1,0,0,0]\n\nSumming these gives [3,6,1,0,0,0], which matches the second output row.\n\nOutput row 2:\n\nInput row 2 shifted 0: [0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nInput row 1 shifted 1: [0,3,0,0,0,0]\n\nInput row 0 shifted 2: [0,0,6,1,0,0]\n\nSumming gives [0,3,6,1,0,0], which matches the third output row.\n\nOutput row 3:\n\nInput row 2 shifted 1: [0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nInput row 1 shifted 2: [0,0,3,0,0,0]\n\nInput row 0 shifted 3: [0,0,0,6,1,0]\n\nSumming: [0,0,3,6,1,0] \u2192 which matches the fourth output row.\n\nOutput row 4:\n\nInput row 2 shifted 2: [0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nInput row 1 shifted 3: [0,0,0,3,0,0]\n\nInput row 0 shifted 4: [0,0,0,0,6,1]\n\nSum: [0,0,0,3,6,1] \u2192 but Example 0's fifth output row is [0,0,0,3,6,1]. Wait, the fifth output row in Example 0 is [0,0,0,0,3,6]. Hmm, this doesn't match. Wait, maybe the shifting is different. Let me re-examine.\n\nWait, maybe the shift is not for all possible rows, but for each output row, the shift is equal to the output row index minus the input row index. For example, output row i is the sum of input rows j shifted by (i - j) positions. But for each input row j, if (i - j) is non-negative, then shift input row j by (i - j) positions. Otherwise, ignore.\n\nSo for output row i:\n\nsum over j from 0 to 2, of (input_row j shifted by (i - j) positions to the right) if (i - j) >=0.\n\nLet me check this for Example 0's output row 4 (i=4):\n\nj=0: shift by 4-0=4 \u2192 [0,0,0,0,6,1]\n\nj=1: shift by 4-1=3 \u2192 [0,0,0,3,0,0]\n\nj=2: shift by 4-2=2 \u2192 [0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nSumming these: 0,0,0,3+0,6+0,1+0 \u2192 [0,0,0,3,6,1]. But in the actual output row 4 of Example 0, it's [0,0,0,3,6,1]. Wait, but the fifth output row (i=5) would be:\n\nj=0: shift by 5 \u2192 [0,0,0,0,0,6], but the input row 0 is [6,1,0], so shifting by 5 would have 6 at position 5 \u2192 [0,0,0,0,0,6].\n\nj=1: shift by 4 \u2192 input row 1 [3,0,0] shifted by 4 \u2192 [0,0,0,0,3].\n\nWait, input row 1 has three elements. Shifting by 4 would result in [0,0,0,0,3,0]?\n\nWait, when you shift a row right by n positions, you add n zeros in front and truncate to length 6. For example, input row j is length 3. Shifting it by k positions would result in k zeros followed by the original elements, then padded with zeros to make 6 elements.\n\nSo for input row j [a, b, c], shifted by k positions would be [0]*k + [a, b, c] + [0]*(6 - k -3). But since 3 elements shifted by k, the total length after shifting would be 3 + k, but the output row must be 6 elements. So, for example, shifting [6,1,0] by 1 position would give [0,6,1,0,0,0]. Wait, no: shifting right by 1 would insert one zero at the beginning, then the original elements, then fill with zeros up to 6 elements. So [6,1,0] shifted by 1 \u2192 [0,6,1,0,0,0].\n\nLet me re-express this. Each input row j is a 3-element array. When shifted by k positions, it becomes a 6-element array where the first k elements are 0, followed by the original elements, then followed by (6 - k -3) zeros. But if k + 3 exceeds 6, then the elements are truncated. For example, shifting a 3-element array by 4 positions would result in [0,0,0,0, a, b] (since 4 + 3 =7, which is longer than 6, so the last element is dropped). Wait, no. Let's see:\n\nShifting by k positions: the original elements start at position k. So for k=4, positions 0-3 are zeros, then positions 4,5,6 would have the original elements. But the array is length 6, so position 6 is beyond. So the result would be [0,0,0,0, a, b], because the third element (c) is at position 6, which is beyond the array length of 6 (indices 0-5). So it's truncated. So shifting by 4 would result in the first two elements of the original array in positions 4 and 5, and the third element (c) is lost.\n\nSo for input row j, shifted by k, the resulting array is:\n\n[0 for _ in 0..k-1] + input_row_j[0..min(3, 6 -k)] \n\nBut this may get complicated.\n\nAlternatively, when you shift a row by k positions to the right, the elements are placed starting at column k, and any elements that go beyond column 5 (the last index) are dropped.\n\nSo for example, input row 0 [6,1,0], shifted by 1:\n\nColumns 0: 0, 1:6, 2:1, 3:0, 4:0, 5:0 \u2192 [0,6,1,0,0,0].\n\nShifted by 2: [0,0,6,1,0,0].\n\nShifted by 3: [0,0,0,6,1,0].\n\nShifted by 4: [0,0,0,0,6,1].\n\nShifted by 5: [0,0,0,0,0,6].\n\nShifted by 6: all zeros.\n\nNow, for each output row i (0 to 5), the row is the sum of input rows shifted by (i - j) positions, where j is the input row index (0,1,2). But only if (i - j) >=0. Otherwise, that input row doesn't contribute to that output row.\n\nSo output_row_i = sum over j=0 to 2 (if i-j >=0) of (input_row_j shifted by (i-j) positions).\n\nLet's test this with Example 0.\n\nExample 0's input rows:\n\nRow0: [6,1,0]\n\nRow1: [3,0,0]\n\nRow2: [0,0,0]\n\nNow, let's compute each output row:\n\ni=0:\n\nj can be 0 (since 0-0=0 >=0), j=1 (0-1=-1 <0, so no), j=2 (0-2=-2 <0, no).\n\nSo output_row_0 = row0 shifted by 0 \u2192 [6,1,0,0,0,0]. Which matches.\n\ni=1:\n\nj=0 (1-0=1 >=0 \u2192 shift row0 by 1 \u2192 [0,6,1,0,0,0]\n\nj=1 (1-1=0 \u2192 shift row1 by 0 \u2192 [3,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nj=2: 1-2=-1 <0 \u2192 no.\n\nSum: [0+3, 6+0, 1+0, 0+0, 0+0, 0+0] \u2192 [3,6,1,0,0,0]. Which matches the second row of Example 0's output.\n\ni=2:\n\nj=0: 2-0=2 \u2192 shift row0 by 2 \u2192 [0,0,6,1,0,0]\n\nj=1: 2-1=1 \u2192 shift row1 by1 \u2192 [0,3,0,0,0,0]\n\nj=2: 2-2=0 \u2192 shift row2 by0 \u2192 [0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nSum: [0+0+0, 0+3+0, 6+0+0, 1+0+0, ...] \u2192 [0,3,6,1,0,0], which matches the third row.\n\ni=3:\n\nj=0: 3-0=3 \u2192 shift row0 by3 \u2192 [0,0,0,6,1,0]\n\nj=1: 3-1=2 \u2192 shift row1 by2 \u2192 [0,0,3,0,0,0]\n\nj=2: 3-2=1 \u2192 shift row2 by1 \u2192 [0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nSum: [0+0+0, 0+0+0, 0+3+0, 6+0+0, 1+0+0, 0+0+0] \u2192 [0,0,3,6,1,0], which matches the fourth row.\n\ni=4:\n\nj=0: 4-0=4 \u2192 shift row0 by4 \u2192 [0,0,0,0,6,1]\n\nj=1:4-1=3 \u2192 shift row1 by3 \u2192 [0,0,0,3,0,0]\n\nj=2:4-2=2 \u2192 shift row2 by2 \u2192 [0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nSum: [0,0,0,3+0,6+0,1+0] \u2192 [0,0,0,3,6,1], which is the fifth row of the output. But in Example 0, the fifth row is [0,0,0,0,3,6]. Wait, this doesn't match. Wait, in Example 0, the fifth output row is [0,0,0,0,3,6], but according to this calculation, it's [0,0,0,3,6,1]. There's a discrepancy here. So this suggests that the pattern isn't exactly this.\n\nWait, let me check Example 0's output again:\n\nOutput rows:\n\nRow4: [0, 0, 0, 3, 6, 1]\n\nRow5: [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 6]\n\nHmm, according to the calculation for i=4 (output row 4), we get [0,0,0,3,6,1], which matches the fifth output row in the example (since indexes start at 0, output row 4 is the fifth row). Wait, maybe there's confusion between 0-based and 1-based indices. Let me recheck:\n\nThe output rows for Example 0 are:\n\n0: [6,1,0,0,0,0]\n\n1: [3,6,1,0,0,0]\n\n2: [0,3,6,1,0,0]\n\n3: [0,0,3,6,1,0]\n\n4: [0,0,0,3,6,1]\n\n5: [0,0,0,0,3,6]\n\nSo for i=4 (output row 4), according to the calculation, we have j=0's contribution shifted by4 \u2192 [0,0,0,0,6,1], j=1 shifted by3 \u2192 [0,0,0,3,0,0], j=2 shifted by2 \u2192 [0,0,0,0,0,0]. Sum: [0,0,0,3,6,1], which matches output row4.\n\nThen for i=5:\n\nj=0: shift by5 \u2192 [0,0,0,0,0,6]\n\nj=1: shift by4 \u2192 [0,0,0,0,3,0]\n\nj=2: shift by3 \u2192 [0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nSum: [0+0+0, 0+0+0, 0+0+0, 0+0+0, 0+3+0, 6+0+0] \u2192 [0,0,0,0,3,6], which matches the sixth output row (i=5).\n\nYes, so the pattern holds.\n\nSo the pattern is that each output row i is formed by summing the shifted versions of the input rows j, where each input row j is shifted by (i - j) positions to the right. Only the input rows j where i >= j are considered. The shifting is done by adding (i-j) zeros to the beginning of the input row j, then padding with zeros to make the length 6. Then, all these shifted rows are summed element-wise to form the output row.\n\nNow, applying this to the test input.\n\nTest Input:\n\n[0, 0, 3]\n\n[0, 0, 0]\n\n[0, 4, 9]\n\nSo, input rows are:\n\nRow0: [0,0,3]\n\nRow1: [0,0,0]\n\nRow2: [0,4,9]\n\nNow, for each output row i (0 to 5), we need to compute the sum of input rows j shifted by (i-j) positions.\n\nLet's compute each output row step by step.\n\nOutput row 0 (i=0):\n\nOnly j=0 contributes. Shift row0 by 0 \u2192 [0,0,3,0,0,0].\n\nSo output row0: [0,0,3,0,0,0].\n\nBut wait, the first example had the first row as [6,1,0,0,0,0], which matches the input row 0 shifted by 0. So this would be the case here as well.\n\nBut wait, in the test input, row0 is [0,0,3], so shifted by 0 \u2192 [0,0,3,0,0,0].\n\nBut let's see the training examples. For example, in Example 1, the input row0 is [0,4,0], so output row0 is [0,4,0,0,0,0]. So yes, shifted by 0.\n\nSo output row0 is [0,0,3,0,0,0].\n\nOutput row1 (i=1):\n\nj=0: shifted by 1-0=1 \u2192 [0,0,0,3,0,0]\n\nj=1: shifted by 1-1=0 \u2192 [0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nSum these two: [0+0, 0+0, 0+0, 3+0, 0+0, 0+0] \u2192 [0,0,0,3,0,0]. But according to the pattern, we also need to consider j=2: i-j=1-2= -1 <0, so no contribution.\n\nWait, j can be 0, 1, 2, but only if i-j >=0. So for i=1, j=0 and j=1 (since 1-0=1 >=0 and 1-1=0 >=0, j=2 is 1-2=-1 <0).\n\nSo j=0 contribution: row0 shifted by1 \u2192 [0,0,0,3,0,0]\n\nj=1 contribution: row1 shifted by0 \u2192 [0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nSum: [0,0,0,3,0,0].\n\nBut looking at Example 1's output row1, which is [0,8,4,0,0,0], which includes the sum of row1 shifted by0 (j=1) and row0 shifted by1 (j=0). So in the test case's row1, the sum would be [0 (from j=0 shifted by1) +0 (j=1 shifted by0) ]?\n\nWait, no. Wait, for j=0 in test input, row0 is [0,0,3], shifted by1 \u2192 [0,0,0,3,0,0] (since shifted by1: first element 0, then original elements starting at position1).\n\nBut wait, when you shift a row right by k positions, you add k zeros to the left and truncate to 6 elements. So for row0 [0,0,3] shifted by1: [0,0,0,3,0,0].\n\nj=1 is row1 [0,0,0], shifted by0 \u2192 [0,0,0,0,0,0].\n\nSo sum is [0,0,0,3,0,0]. So output row1 is [0,0,0,3,0,0]. But looking at the training examples, for instance in Example 2's input:\n\nInput row0: [0,0,6], row1: [1,3,0], row2: [0,0,0].\n\nOutput row1: [1,3,0,6,0,0]. Which is row1 shifted by0 (1,3,0,0,0,0) plus row0 shifted by1 (0,0,0,6,0,0). So sum is [1,3,0,6,0,0].\n\nSo applying the same logic here, test output row1 should be [0 (from row1) + 0 (from row0 shifted by1) \u2192 0+0, 0+0, 0+3 (wait no, row0 shifted by1 is [0,0,0,3,0,0], so the fourth element is 3. So the sum for row1 would be:\n\n[0 (j=1's shifted by0 row: [0,0,0,0,0,0] ) + j=0's shifted by1 row: [0,0,0,3,0,0] ].\n\nSo sum is [0+0, 0+0, 0+0, 3+0, 0+0, 0+0] \u2192 [0,0,0,3,0,0].\n\nBut according to the training examples, the second row (i=1) starts with the second input row's first element shifted by0. Wait, in Example 0's output row1: [3,6,1,0,0,0], which is row1 shifted by0 (3,0,0 \u2192 [3,0,0,0,0,0]) plus row0 shifted by1 ([0,6,1,0,0,0]). So sum is [3,6,1,0,0,0].\n\nSo similarly, for the test input's row1, the sum would be j=1 shifted by0 (row1 [0,0,0] shifted by0 \u2192 [0,0,0,0,0,0]) and j=0 shifted by1 \u2192 [0,0,0,3,0,0]. So the sum is [0,0,0,3,0,0].\n\nBut this doesn't seem to match the training examples' patterns. Let's see.\n\nBut perhaps I made a mistake in the way shifting is done. Let me re-express the shifting logic.\n\nWhen shifting a row by k positions to the right, the original elements start at position k. For example:\n\nOriginal row: [a, b, c]\n\nShifted by 0 \u2192 [a, b, c, 0, 0, 0]\n\nShifted by 1 \u2192 [0, a, b, c, 0, 0]\n\nShifted by 2 \u2192 [0, 0, a, b, c, 0]\n\nShifted by 3 \u2192 [0, 0, 0, a, b, c]\n\nShifted by 4 \u2192 [0, 0, 0, 0, a, b] (c is truncated)\n\nShifted by 5 \u2192 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, a] (b and c truncated)\n\nSo for the test input's row0 [0,0,3] shifted by0 \u2192 [0,0,3,0,0,0]\n\nShifted by1 \u2192 [0,0,0,0,3,0]\n\nWait, no. Wait, shifting by1 would mean inserting one zero at the beginning:\n\nOriginal row is length 3. When shifted by1, the elements start at index 1. So the first element is 0, followed by 0,0,3, then zeros. But since the output row must be length 6:\n\nRow0 shifted by1: [0,0,0,3,0,0]. Because:\n\nShifted by1 \u2192 first three elements are 0,0,0 (original elements start at position1: 0,3, but positions 1, 2, 3 are filled with 0,3,0? Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, the original row is [0,0,3]. Shifting it by k positions to the right means that the first element of the shifted row is at position k. So for k=0, it's [0,0,3,0,0,0]. For k=1, it's [0 (position0), 0 (position1), 0 (position2), 3 (position3), 0,0]. So shifted by1 \u2192 [0,0,0,3,0,0]. For k=2 \u2192 [0,0,0,0,3,0]. For k=3 \u2192 [0,0,0,0,0,3]. For k=4 \u2192 [0,0,0,0,0,0] (since the original elements would start at position4: 0,0,3, but the row length is 6, so position4 is 0, position5 is0, and 3 is beyond).\n\nWait, no. If the original row is [0,0,3], shifting by k=4:\n\nThe elements would start at position4. So positions4,5,6 would be 0,0,3. But the row is length6, so positions4 and5 are 0 and0, and position6 is beyond, so 3 is truncated. So shifted by4: [0,0,0,0,0,0].\n\nWait, this is getting confusing. Let's think of it as: when you shift the row by k, the elements are placed starting at index k, and if the shifted elements go beyond the row length (6), they are truncated.\n\nSo for row0 [0,0,3] shifted by1:\n\npositions0:0, 1:0, 2:0, 3:3, 4:0,5:0.\n\nSo the shifted row is [0,0,0,3,0,0].\n\nShifted by2:\n\npositions0:0, 1:0, 2:0, 3:0, 4:3,5:0 \u2192 [0,0,0,0,3,0].\n\nShifted by3:\n\npositions0:0, 1:0, 2:0,3:0,4:0,5:3 \u2192 [0,0,0,0,0,3].\n\nShifted by4:\n\npositions0:0, 1:0,2:0,3:0,4:0,5:0 (since the elements start at4:0,0,3, but positions4 and5 can hold 0 and0, and the 3 is beyond \u2192 [0,0,0,0,0,0].\n\nSo, back to the test case's output row1 (i=1):\n\nj=0: shifted by1 \u2192 [0,0,0,3,0,0]\n\nj=1: shifted by0 \u2192 row1 is [0,0,0], shifted by0 \u2192 [0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nj=2: i-j =1-2 =-1 \u2192 no.\n\nSum: [0+0, 0+0, 0+0, 3+0, 0+0, 0+0] \u2192 [0,0,0,3,0,0].\n\nBut according to the training examples, for example Example2:\n\nInput row0 [0,0,6], row1 [1,3,0], row2 [0,0,0]\n\nOutput row1 is [1,3,0,6,0,0]. Which is row1 shifted0 (1,3,0,0,0,0) + row0 shifted1 (0,0,0,6,0,0) \u2192 [1,3,0,6,0,0].\n\nSo for the test case's row1, the sum would be [0 (from row1) shifted0 \u2192 [0,0,0,0,0,0] ] + [0,0,0,3,0,0] (row0 shifted1) \u2192 [0,0,0,3,0,0].\n\nSo output row1 is [0,0,0,3,0,0].\n\nProceeding to output row2 (i=2):\n\nj can be 0 (2-0=2), j=1 (2-1=1), j=2 (2-2=0).\n\nSo contributions:\n\nj=0 shifted by2 \u2192 [0,0,0,0,3,0]\n\nj=1 shifted by1 \u2192 row1 [0,0,0] shifted by1 \u2192 [0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nj=2 shifted by0 \u2192 row2 [0,4,9] shifted by0 \u2192 [0,4,9,0,0,0]\n\nSum: [0+0+0, 0+0+4, 0+0+9, 0+0+0,3+0+0,0+0+0] \u2192 [0,4,9,0,3,0].\n\nWait, let's compute each element:\n\nindex0: 0 (j=0's shift2) +0 (j=1's shift1) +0 (j=2's shift0) \u21920\n\nindex1:0 +0 +4 \u21924\n\nindex2:0 +0 +9 \u21929\n\nindex3:3 (from j=0's shift2) \u2192 wait no. j=0's shift2 is [0,0,0,0,3,0]. So index3 is 0. Because when shifting row0 [0,0,3] by2, the elements start at position2:\n\nposition2:0, position3:0, position4:3 \u2192 so the shifted row0 is [0,0,0,0,3,0].\n\nSo j=0's shifted row is [0,0,0,0,3,0].\n\nj=1's shifted row by1 is [0,0,0,0,0,0].\n\nj=2's shifted row by0 is [0,4,9,0,0,0].\n\nSumming element-wise:\n\nindex0:0+0+0=0\n\nindex1:0+0+4=4\n\nindex2:0+0+9=9\n\nindex3:0+0+0=0\n\nindex4:3+0+0=3\n\nindex5:0+0+0=0\n\nSo output row2 is [0,4,9,0,3,0].\n\nBut looking at Example 2's output row2: [0,1,3,0,6,0]. Which is row2 shifted0 (0,0,0 \u2192 no, wait row2 is [0,0,0] in Example2). So perhaps the test case's row2 is different. Let's proceed.\n\nOutput row3 (i=3):\n\nj=0 shifted by3 \u2192 row0 shifted3 \u2192 [0,0,0,0,0,3]\n\nj=1 shifted by2 \u2192 row1 [0,0,0] shifted2 \u2192 [0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nj=2 shifted by1 \u2192 row2 [0,4,9] shifted1 \u2192 [0,0,4,9,0,0]\n\nSum:\n\nindex0:0+0+0=0\n\nindex1:0+0+0=0\n\nindex2:0+0+4=4\n\nindex3:0+0+9=9\n\nindex4:0+0+0=0\n\nindex5:3+0+0=3\n\nWait, row0 shifted by3 is [0,0,0,0,0,3].\n\nrow2 shifted by1: [0,0,4,9,0,0].\n\nSo sum elements:\n\n[0, 0, 4, 9, 0, 3+0=3]? Wait, no, each element is summed for each index.\n\nSo:\n\nindex0:0 (from j0 shifted3) +0 (j1 shifted2) +0 (j2 shifted1) \u21920\n\nindex1:0+0+0=0\n\nindex2:0+0+4=4\n\nindex3:0 (j0's shifted3 index3 is 0) +0 (j1's) +9 (j2's) \u21929\n\nindex4:0 (j0's shifted3 index4 is 0) +0 +0=0\n\nindex5:3 (from j0's shifted3 index5) +0 +0=3.\n\nSo output row3 is [0,0,4,9,0,3].\n\nBut this seems odd. Let's re-express:\n\nj=0 shifted by3 \u2192 [0,0,0,0,0,3]\n\nj=1 shifted by2 \u2192 [0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nj=2 shifted by1 \u2192 [0,0,4,9,0,0]\n\nSum:\n\n[0,0,0+4=4, 0+9=9, 0+0=0, 3+0=3]\n\nSo output row3 is [0,0,4,9,0,3].\n\nBut looking at the training examples, in Example2, output row3 is [0,0,1,3,0,6], which sums input rows j=0 shifted3 (0,0,0,0,0,6), j=1 shifted2 (0,0,1,3,0,0), j=2 shifted1 (0,0,0,0,0,0). Sum is [0+0+0,0+0+0, 0+1+0, 6+3+0, 0+0+0, 0+0+0]. So [0,0,1,9,0,0]? Wait, no. Let me check.\n\nWait Example2's input row0 is [0,0,6], row1 is [1,3,0], row2 is [0,0,0].\n\nFor i=3 (output row3):\n\nj=0 shifted3 \u2192 [0,0,0,0,0,6]\n\nj=1 shifted2 \u2192 [0,0,1,3,0,0]\n\nj=2 shifted1 \u2192 [0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nSum:\n\nindex0:0+0+0=0\n\nindex1:0+0+0=0\n\nindex2:0+1+0=1\n\nindex3:0+3+0=3\n\nindex4:0+0+0=0\n\nindex5:6+0+0=6 \u2192 so [0,0,1,3,0,6], which matches.\n\nSo in the test case's output row3, it's [0,0,4,9,0,3].\n\nContinuing:\n\nOutput row4 (i=4):\n\nj=0 shifted4 \u2192 row0 shifted4 \u2192 [0,0,0,0,0,0] (since after shifting by4, the elements start at position4: 0,0,3 \u2192 but positions4 and5 are 0 and0, so shifted4 is [0,0,0,0,0,0].\n\nj=1 shifted3 \u2192 row1 [0,0,0] shifted3 \u2192 [0,0,0,0,0,0].\n\nj=2 shifted2 \u2192 row2 [0,4,9] shifted2 \u2192 [0,0,0,4,9,0].\n\nSum:\n\nindex0:0+0+0=0\n\nindex1:0+0+0=0\n\nindex2:0+0+0=0\n\nindex3:0+0+4=4\n\nindex4:0+0+9=9\n\nindex5:0+0+0=0\n\nSo output row4 is [0,0,0,4,9,0].\n\nOutput row5 (i=5):\n\nj=0 shifted5 \u2192 row0 [0,0,3] shifted5 \u2192 [0,0,0,0,0,0] (elements start at position5: 0, but 3 would be at position6 which is beyond).\n\nj=1 shifted4 \u2192 row1 [0,0,0] shifted4 \u2192 [0,0,0,0,0,0].\n\nj=2 shifted3 \u2192 row2 [0,4,9] shifted3 \u2192 [0,0,0,0,4,9].\n\nSum:\n\nindex0-3:0.\n\nindex4:0+0+4=4.\n\nindex5:0+0+9=9.\n\nSo output row5 is [0,0,0,0,4,9].\n\nBut let's compare this to the training examples. For example, in Example1's input:\n\nRow0: [0,4,0], row1: [0,8,0], row2: [2,0,0]\n\nOutput row5 is [0,0,0,2,0,8]. Which is row2 shifted3 (2 shifted by3 \u2192 [0,0,0,2,0,0]) + row1 shifted4 (8 shifted by4 \u2192 [0,0,0,0,8,0]) + row0 shifted5 (0 shifted by5 \u2192 [0,0,0,0,0,0]). Sum is [0+0+0, 0+0+0, 0+0+0, 2+0+0,0+8+0,0+0+0] \u2192 [0,0,0,2,8,0]. Wait, but the example's output row5 is [0,0,0,2,0,8]. So this suggests that the shifting of row1 by4 for element8 would be in position4, but in the example's output row5, the 8 is in position5. Hmm, perhaps there's a mistake in my shifting logic.\n\nWait, row1 in Example1 is [0,8,0]. Shifted by4 for j=1 when i=5:\n\ni=5, j=1 \u2192 shift by5-1=4.\n\nShifting row1 [0,8,0] by4:\n\nThe elements start at position4. So position4:0, position5:8, position6:0 (truncated). So shifted row is [0,0,0,0,0,8].\n\nSo in Example1's output row5:\n\nj=2 shifted3 \u2192 [0,0,0,2,0,0]\n\nj=1 shifted4 \u2192 [0,0,0,0,0,8]\n\nj=0 shifted5 \u2192 [0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nSum: [0,0,0,2,0,8].\n\nWhich matches the example.\n\nAh, so when shifting row1 [0,8,0] by4, the elements start at position4: 0,8,0. But the row length is6, so positions4 and5 are 0 and8. So shifted row is [0,0,0,0,0,8].\n\nSo the mistake earlier was in the shifting logic. For example, shifting row1 [0,8,0] by4:\n\nOriginal row is [0,8,0]. Shift by4 \u2192 first four elements are zeros, followed by the original elements starting at position4. So the elements after four zeros would be 0 (position4), 8 (position5), and 0 (position6, which is beyond). So the shifted row is [0,0,0,0,0,8].\n\nThis changes things.\n\nSo, the correct way to shift a row by k positions is to insert k zeros at the beginning and then take the first 6 elements of the resulting array.\n\nFor example, row [a, b, c] shifted by k:\n\nShifted_row = [0]*k + [a, b, c] \n\nThen truncated to 6 elements. \n\nSo for example, if the original row is [0,0,3] and shifted by4:\n\nShifted_row = [0,0,0,0] + [0,0,3] \u2192 [0,0,0,0,0,3] (since total length is 7, but we take first 6: [0,0,0,0,0,3].\n\nWait, no. Wait, the original row is 3 elements. When shifted byk positions, the new array is [0]*k + original_row. If this is longer than6, truncate to6 elements. If shorter, pad with zeros to make6 elements.\n\nSo for shifting row0 [0,0,3] by4:\n\n[0,0,0,0] (4 zeros) + [0,0,3] \u2192 [0,0,0,0,0,0,3]. Then take first6 elements: [0,0,0,0,0,0].\n\nWait, no. The original row is [0,0,3]. Shifting by4 positions would mean inserting 4 zeros before it. So the shifted row would be [0,0,0,0,0,0,3], but since we need to make it 6 elements, we take the first6: [0,0,0,0,0,0].\n\nBut this contradicts the earlier example. So perhaps the correct way is to shift the row such that the elements start at positionk, and if there's not enough space, they are truncated.\n\nSo for shifting row [a,b,c] byk:\n\nFor each element in the original row, its new position is k + i, where i is the original index (0,1,2).\n\nIf k + i >=6, the element is discarded.\n\nSo for row [0,0,3] shifted by4:\n\nelements are at positions4,5,6. Positions4 and5 are valid (indices0-5), position6 is invalid. So the shifted row has 0 at position4 (original element0), 0 at5 (original element1), and3 is discarded. So the shifted row is [0,0,0,0,0,0].\n\nBut in Example1, row1 is [0,8,0], shifted by4: elements at positions4,5,6. 0 at4, 8 at5, 0 at6 (discarded). So shifted row is [0,0,0,0,0,8].\n\nAh, yes. So the correct way is:\n\nEach element of the original row is placed at positionk + i. If this is within 0-5, it's kept; else, discarded.\n\nSo for row [0,8,0] shifted by4:\n\nelement0:0 at position4 \u2192 index4:0\n\nelement1:8 at position5 \u2192 index5:8\n\nelement2:0 at position6 \u2192 discarded.\n\nSo the shifted row is [0,0,0,0,0,8].\n\nThis changes the earlier calculations.\n\nLet me re-calculate the test case's output rows with this correct shifting logic.\n\nTest input:\n\nrow0: [0,0,3]\n\nrow1: [0,0,0]\n\nrow2: [0,4,9]\n\nLet's recompute each output row.\n\nOutput row0 (i=0):\n\nOnly j=0 contributes, shifted by0.\n\nshifted_row = row0 shifted0:\n\nelements at positions0,1,2 \u2192 0,0,3.\n\nSo output row0 is [0,0,3,0,0,0].\n\nOutput row1 (i=1):\n\nj=0: shifted by1. row0 elements at positions1,2,3: 0,0,3.\n\nSo shifted_row: [0,0,0,3,0,0].\n\nj=1: shifted by0. row1 elements at positions0,1,2:0,0,0.\n\nSum: [0+0, 0+0, 0+0,3+0, 0+0,0+0] \u2192 [0,0,0,3,0,0].\n\nOutput row2 (i=2):\n\nj=0: shifted by2. elements at positions2,3,4:0,3,0 (original row0 elements are 0 (i=0),0 (i=1),3 (i=2)). When shifted by2, positions are 2+0=2, 2+1=3, 2+2=4 \u2192 elements0,0,3. So shifted_row is [0,0,0,0,3,0].\n\nj=1: shifted by1. elements at positions1,2,3:0,0,0 \u2192 [0,0,0,0,0,0].\n\nj=2: shifted by0. elements at positions0,1,2:0,4,9 \u2192 [0,4,9,0,0,0].\n\nSum:\n\n[0+0+0, 0+0+4, 0+0+9, 0+0+0,3+0+0,0+0+0] \u2192 [0,4,9,0,3,0].\n\nOutput row3 (i=3):\n\nj=0: shifted by3. elements at positions3,4,5:0,3,0 \u2192 shifted_row [0,0,0,0,3,0].\n\nj=1: shifted by2. elements at positions2,3,4:0,0,0 \u2192 [0,0,0,0,0,0].\n\nj=2: shifted by1. elements at positions1,2,3:4,9,0 \u2192 shifted_row [0,4,9,0,0,0].\n\nWait, j=2's shifted by1: elements are at positions1,2,3 \u2192 original row2 elements [0,4,9]. positions1:4, position2:9, position3:0 (since j=2's elements are 0 (index0),4 (index1),9 (index2). When shifted by1, elements are placed at 1+0=1:0 \u2192 no, wait j=2's shifted by (i-j) =3-2=1. So elements are placed at positions1,2,3. So element0 of row2 (0) is at position1, element1 (4) at position2, element2 (9) at position3. So shifted_row for j=2 shifted by1 is [0,0,4,9,0,0].\n\nSo summing j=0 shifted3 \u2192 [0,0,0,0,3,0], j=1 shifted2 \u2192 [0,0,0,0,0,0], j=2 shifted1 \u2192 [0,0,4,9,0,0].\n\nSum:\n\nindex0:0+0+0=0\n\nindex1:0+0+0=0\n\nindex2:0+0+4=4\n\nindex3:0+0+9=9\n\nindex4:3+0+0=3\n\nindex5:0+0+0=0.\n\nSo output row3 is [0,0,4,9,3,0].\n\nBut wait, j=0 shifted3:\n\nelements are placed at positions3,4,5. But original row0's elements are [0,0,3]. So position3:0, position4:0, position5:3. So shifted_row for j=0 shifted3 is [0,0,0,0,0,3].\n\nOh wait, I made a mistake here. Earlier I thought that shifting row0 by3 would place the elements starting at position3. So original row0's elements 0,0,3 are placed at positions3,4,5. But position5 is the last index (0-based), so:\n\nshifted_row for j=0 shifted by3:\n\npositions0-2:0, position3:0, position4:0, position5:3 \u2192 [0,0,0,0,0,3].\n\nSo for output row3:\n\nj=0's contribution is [0,0,0,0,0,3].\n\nj=2's contribution is [0,0,4,9,0,0].\n\nSum:\n\nindex0:0+0=0\n\nindex1:0+0=0\n\nindex2:0+4=4\n\nindex3:0+9=9\n\nindex4:0+0=0\n\nindex5:3+0=3.\n\nSo output row3 is [0,0,4,9,0,3].\n\nOutput row4 (i=4):\n\nj=0: shifted by4. elements at positions4,5,6 \u2192 positions4:0, 5:0, 6:3 (discarded). So shifted_row [0,0,0,0,0,0].\n\nj=1: shifted by3. elements at positions3,4,5 \u21920,0,0 \u2192 [0,0,0,0,0,0].\n\nj=2: shifted by2. elements at positions2,3,4 \u21924,9,0 \u2192 shifted_row [0,0,0,4,9,0].\n\nSum:\n\n[0+0+0,0+0+0,0+0+0,0+0+4,0+0+9,0+0+0] \u2192 [0,0,0,4,9,0].\n\nOutput row5 (i=5):\n\nj=0: shifted by5. elements at positions5,6,7 \u2192 position5:0 (element0), 6:0 (element1), 7:3 (discarded). So shifted_row [0,0,0,0,0,0].\n\nj=1: shifted by4. elements at positions4,5,6 \u21920,0,0 \u2192 [0,0,0,0,0,0].\n\nj=2: shifted by3. elements at positions3,4,5 \u21929,0, (element0 of j=2 is 0 \u2192 position3+0=3:0; element1:4 \u2192 position3+1=4:4; element2:9 \u2192 position3+2=5:9. So shifted_row is [0,0,0,0,4,9].\n\nSum:\n\n[0+0+0,0+0+0,0+0+0,0+0+0,0+0+4,0+0+9] \u2192 [0,0,0,0,4,9].\n\nPutting it all together, the output matrix would be:\n\nRow0: [0,0,3,0,0,0]\n\nRow1: [0,0,0,3,0,0]\n\nRow2: [0,4,9,0,3,0]\n\nRow3: [0,0,4,9,0,3]\n\nRow4: [0,0,0,4,9,0]\n\nRow5: [0,0,0,0,4,9]\n\nBut comparing this to the training examples' structure, the output rows should have the elements from the input matrix arranged in a way that each subsequent row shifts the elements to the right, similar to the examples. \n\nFor example, in Example0's output, each row after the first starts with the next element from the second input row, then followed by shifted elements from the first input row. Similarly, the test case's output should follow this pattern.\n\nLooking at the computed output for the test case:\n\nRow0: [0,0,3,0,0,0]\n\nRow1: [0,0,0,3,0,0]\n\nRow2: [0,4,9,0,3,0]\n\nRow3: [0,0,4,9,0,3]\n\nRow4: [0,0,0,4,9,0]\n\nRow5: [0,0,0,0,4,9]\n\nThis seems to follow the pattern. For example, row2 starts with 0 (from input row2 shifted0: [0,4,9,0,0,0]) and includes shifted elements from row0 and row1. \n\nBut comparing to the training examples, for instance Example1's output:\n\nINPUT:\n\n[0,4,0]\n\n[0,8,0]\n\n[2,0,0]\n\nOUTPUT:\n\n[0,4,0,0,0,0]\n\n[0,8,4,0,0,0]\n\n[2,0,8,4,0,0]\n\n[0,2,0,8,4,0]\n\n[0,0,2,0,8,4]\n\n[0,0,0,2,0,8]\n\nWe can see that the elements from row2 (2,0,0) start appearing in the third output row (index2) and shift right in subsequent rows. Similarly, in the test case's output, the row2 elements (0,4,9) appear in row2 and shift right in subsequent rows.\n\nThus, the computed output for the test case should be:\n\n[0,0,3,0,0,0]\n\n[0,0,0,3,0,0]\n\n[0,4,9,0,3,0]\n\n[0,0,4,9,0,3]\n\n[0,0,0,4,9,0]\n\n[0,0,0,0,4,9]\n\nBut let's check if this matches the pattern from the training examples. \n\nFor example, in Example2:\n\nINPUT:\n\n[0,0,6]\n\n[1,3,0]\n\n[0,0,0]\n\nOUTPUT:\n\n[0,0,6,0,0,0]\n\n[1,3,0,6,0,0]\n\n[0,1,3,0,6,0]\n\n[0,0,1,3,0,6]\n\n[0,0,0,1,3,0]\n\n[0,0,0,0,1,3]\n\nIn this case, the second input row [1,3,0] is shifted right each row. Similarly, in the test case, the third input row [0,4,9] appears in row2 as [0,4,9,0,0,0] (shifted0), then in row3 shifted1 \u2192 [0,0,4,9,0,0], but when summed with other contributions.\n\nBut according to the calculations, the test case's output rows are as follows. However, there might be a mistake in the calculation for row2 and row3.\n\nWait, let's recheck row2 for the test case:\n\ni=2:\n\nj=0 shifted by2 \u2192 row0 shifted2. row0 is [0,0,3]. shifted by2: elements at positions2,3,4 \u21920,3,0.\n\nSo shifted_row is [0,0,0,3,0,0].\n\nj=1 shifted by1 \u2192 row1 [0,0,0] shifted by1 \u2192 [0,0,0,0,0,0].\n\nj=2 shifted by0 \u2192 row2 [0,4,9] \u2192 [0,4,9,0,0,0].\n\nSum: [0+0+0, 0+0+4, 0+0+9, 3+0+0, 0+0+0, 0+0+0] \u2192 [0,4,9,3,0,0].\n\nWait, no. Because j=0's shifted by2 gives [0,0,0,3,0,0], j=2's shifted by0 gives [0,4,9,0,0,0]. Sum:\n\nindex0:0+0=0\n\nindex1:0+4=4\n\nindex2:0+9=9\n\nindex3:3+0=3\n\nindex4:0+0=0\n\nindex5:0+0=0.\n\nSo row2 should be [0,4,9,3,0,0]. But earlier calculation had a mistake.\n\nOh no, this changes everything. So the correct way is:\n\nFor i=2:\n\nj=0 shifted by2 \u2192 row0 [0,0,3] shifted2: positions2,3,4 \u2192 elements0,0,3 \u2192 shifted_row [0,0,0,0,3,0].\n\nj=1 shifted by1 \u2192 row1 [0,0,0] shifted1: positions1,2,3 \u2192 elements0,0,0 \u2192 [0,0,0,0,0,0].\n\nj=2 shifted by0 \u2192 row2 [0,4,9] shifted0 \u2192 [0,4,9,0,0,0].\n\nSum:\n\nindex0:0+0+0=0\n\nindex1:0+0+4=4\n\nindex2:0+0+9=9\n\nindex3:0+0+0=0\n\nindex4:3+0+0=3\n\nindex5:0+0+0=0.\n\nSo row2 is [0,4,9,0,3,0].\n\nAh, there was a mistake in the shifted_row for j=0 shifted by2. The original row0 is [0,0,3]. When shifted by2, elements are at positions2,3,4: which are0,0,3. So the shifted_row is [0,0,0,0,3,0], not [0,0,0,3,0,0]. So the correct calculation:\n\nj=0's contribution is [0,0,0,0,3,0].\n\nj=2's contribution is [0,4,9,0,0,0].\n\nSum:\n\nindex0:0+0=0\n\nindex1:0+4=4\n\nindex2:0+9=9\n\nindex3:0+0=0\n\nindex4:3+0=3\n\nindex5:0+0=0.\n\nSo row2 is [0,4,9,0,3,0].\n\nThis aligns with the earlier correct calculation. So the previous steps were correct.\n\nThus, the final output for the test input should be as computed."
