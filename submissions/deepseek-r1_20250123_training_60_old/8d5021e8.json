        "cot_1": "Okay, let's see. I need to figure out the pattern from the training examples and apply it to the test input. Let's start by looking at each example.\n\nStarting with Example 0:\n\nInput is a 3x2 matrix:\n[0, 8]\n[0, 0]\n[0, 8]\n\nOutput is a 9x4 matrix. Let's check how the input is transformed. The output rows are:\n[8, 0, 0, 8]\n[0, 0, 0, 0]\n[8, 0, 0, 8]\nThen this pattern repeats two more times. Wait, the output has 9 rows. So 3 rows in input become 9 in output. That suggests each input row is converted into three output rows, maybe by some replication or transformation.\n\nLooking at the first input row [0,8], the first output row is [8,0,0,8]. Hmm. The elements are reversed and mirrored? Let's see: original elements 0 and 8. If reversed, 8 and 0. Then mirroring would make 8,0,0,8. Oh right, that's the first row of the output. Then the second row is all zeros. Third row is same as the first. So for each input row, maybe create three rows: reversed and mirrored, then zeros, then reversed again.\n\nWait, but how about the middle row of the input. The input middle row is [0,0], which in the output becomes [0,0,0,0] in the middle of the three rows. So the middle row of the input's three becomes a zero row in the output. But the output has three blocks of three rows each. Wait, the output has 9 rows. So maybe each of the three input rows is expanded into three rows, making 3x3=9 rows. But how exactly?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the input matrix is being transformed into a larger matrix by some reflection or tiling pattern. Let's check the other examples to see if a pattern emerges.\n\nExample 1:\n\nInput:\n[2, 0]\n[2, 2]\n[2, 0]\n\nOutput:\n[0,2,2,0]\n[2,2,2,2]\n[0,2,2,0]\n[0,2,2,0]\n[2,2,2,2]\n[0,2,2,0]\n[0,2,2,0]\n[2,2,2,2]\n[0,2,2,0]\n\nSo input is 3x2, output is 9x4. Each input row seems to generate three output rows. Let's see the first input row [2,0]. The first output row is [0,2,2,0], which is the reverse of the input elements (0,2) mirrored to make [0,2,2,0]. Then the second row is all 2s, maybe from the middle input row [2,2], but how? Wait, the middle input row in example 1 is [2,2], and the output's middle rows in each block are [2,2,2,2]. So maybe the middle input row is transformed into a row of all the first element (2 in this case), repeated four times. Wait, but in example 0, the middle input row was [0,0], and the output middle row was [0,0,0,0], which fits that pattern. So the middle row's output is a row filled with the first element of the middle input row, but since both elements are same, maybe it's taking the sum or the first element.\n\nWait in example 0, the middle input row is [0,0], and the output row is all 0s. That makes sense. Example 1 middle input row [2,2], output row is all 2s. So for the middle row of the input, the output row is four copies of the first element (since both elements are same, but maybe it's just taking one and replicating). \n\nNow, looking at example 2:\n\nInput:\n[0,0]\n[0,5]\n[5,0]\n\nOutput:\n[0,5,5,0]\n[5,0,0,5]\n[0,0,0,0]\n[0,0,0,0]\n[5,0,0,5]\n[0,5,5,0]\n[0,5,5,0]\n[5,0,0,5]\n[0,0,0,0]\n\nHmm. Let's see the input rows. First input row is [0,0], which in output becomes [0,5,5,0]? Wait no. Wait, the first input row is [0,0], but the first output row is [0,5,5,0]. Wait that doesn't match the previous pattern. Maybe I'm missing something. Let me check again.\n\nWait example 2's input is:\n\nRow 0: [0,0]\n\nRow 1: [0,5]\n\nRow 2: [5,0]\n\nThe output has 9 rows. Let's look at the output rows:\n\nFirst three rows of output:\n\n[0,5,5,0]\n\n[5,0,0,5]\n\n[0,0,0,0]\n\nThen next three:\n\n[0,0,0,0]\n\n[5,0,0,5]\n\n[0,5,5,0]\n\nThen next three:\n\n[0,5,5,0]\n\n[5,0,0,5]\n\n[0,0,0,0]\n\nHmm, this is more complex. So for the first input row [0,0], the first output row is [0,5,5,0], but where does the 5 come from? Because the input's middle row is [0,5], maybe the output rows are generated based on the combination of the input rows. Alternatively, maybe each output row is formed by combining elements from the input in a certain way.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is constructed by taking each element from the input matrix and expanding it into a 3x2 block, but that might not fit. Let me think of another approach.\n\nAnother approach: looking at the input as a 3x2 grid, and the output as a 9x4 grid, which is 3x3 times the original size (each input cell becomes a 3x3 block). But maybe not exactly, but let's check.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each input row is expanded into three rows in the output. Let's take example 0:\n\nInput rows:\n\nRow0: [0,8]\n\nRow1: [0,0]\n\nRow2: [0,8]\n\nOutput rows:\n\nEach input row is transformed into three output rows. For row0, the output rows are [8,0,0,8], [0,0,0,0], [8,0,0,8]. Wait no, in the output for example0, the first three rows are:\n\nRow0: [8,0,0,8]\n\nRow1: [0,0,0,0]\n\nRow2: [8,0,0,8]\n\nThen rows 3-5 are same as 0-2, and rows 6-8 same again. So the entire output is three repetitions of the first three rows. But why? That seems like the input is being transformed into a 3-row pattern, then repeated three times. But why?\n\nWait the input in example0 is three rows, and the output is nine rows. So perhaps each input row is processed into three output rows, and the entire input is processed three times. But in example0, the output is three copies of the same three-row group. Hmm, maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the input is treated as a 3x2 grid, and each element is mirrored in some way. For example, taking the first element and the second, and creating a 4-element row by mirroring them. Like [a,b] becomes [b,a,a,b], which when a=0 and b=8 becomes [8,0,0,8], which matches example0's first output row.\n\nYes! So for each input row [a, b], the corresponding output row is [b, a, a, b], then for the middle row, which is [c, d], maybe [c, d, d, c], but wait in example1:\n\nInput row1 is [2,2], and the output middle row is [2,2,2,2]. Wait, but according to [c, d, d, c], if c and d are 2 and 2, it would be [2,2,2,2], which matches. So that works.\n\nWait, for the input rows:\n\nEach row in the input is transformed into a 4-element row by taking the elements in reverse order and mirroring them. So [a, b] becomes [b, a, a, b]. Then, for the middle row of the input, perhaps there's an additional step. Wait, let's check example2:\n\nIn example2, the input row1 is [0,5], which in the output is transformed into [5,0,0,5]. Wait, according to the previous pattern, [0,5] would become [5,0,0,5], which matches the second row of the output in example2. So that seems to hold.\n\nBut wait in example0, the input row1 is [0,0], which becomes [0,0,0,0], which fits [b, a, a, b] where a and b are 0 and 0.\n\nSo the pattern for each input row is: reverse the elements, then mirror them. So [a, b] \u2192 [b, a, a, b].\n\nBut then how does this explain the structure of the output? Because in example0's output, each input row is transformed into a 4-element row, but the output is 9 rows. Wait, the input has 3 rows, each transformed into one row of the output. But then why does the output have 9 rows?\n\nLooking back, in example0's output, there are 9 rows. Let me count: the first three rows are [8,0,0,8], [0,0,0,0], [8,0,0,8], then repeated two more times. So the output is three copies of the transformed input rows. Wait, the input has three rows, each transformed into a 4-element row, but the output is three times those three rows. So the output is three times the transformed input rows stacked vertically.\n\nBut why? Let's check example1:\n\nInput has three rows, transformed into three output rows (each [b,a,a,b] etc.), and the output is those three rows repeated three times. So the output is the transformed input rows concatenated three times.\n\nIn example0, the transformed input rows are:\n\nRow0: [8,0,0,8]\n\nRow1: [0,0,0,0]\n\nRow2: [8,0,0,8]\n\nThen output is these three rows repeated three times. Similarly, example1's output is the transformed rows repeated three times.\n\nExample2's output is different. Let's see:\n\nTransformed input rows:\n\nRow0: [0,0] \u2192 [0,0,0,0]?\n\nWait example2's input row0 is [0,0], which would become [0,0,0,0] according to the [b,a,a,b] pattern. But the first row of the output in example2 is [0,5,5,0]. Wait that's from input row1 [0,5], but how?\n\nWait perhaps I'm misunderstanding the transformation. Maybe each row in the output is derived from a combination of the input's rows. Alternatively, maybe the output is constructed by creating a 3x3 grid of transformed elements from the input.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each element in the input is part of a 3x3 block in the output. Let's think of the input as a 3x2 grid, and the output as a 3x4 grid, but scaled up by 3 in each dimension. Wait, but the output is 9 rows, which is 3 times the input rows. So maybe each input row is generating three output rows, but how?\n\nWait, let's take example0 again. The input rows are:\n\nRow0: [0,8]\n\nRow1: [0,0]\n\nRow2: [0,8]\n\nTransformed into three output rows each. How?\n\nWait the output is 9 rows. If each input row is transformed into three output rows, that makes 3x3=9. Let's check:\n\nFor example0:\n\nInput row0 [0,8] becomes:\n\nRow0: [8,0,0,8]\n\nRow1: [0,0,0,0]\n\nRow2: [8,0,0,8]\n\nSimilarly, input row1 [0,0] becomes three rows of [0,0,0,0], but in the output, the middle rows are [0,0,0,0]. Wait no, in example0's output, the middle rows (like rows 1,4,7) are all [0,0,0,0]. So perhaps each input row is generating three output rows, but the middle one is based on the middle input row. Wait, maybe it's not per input row, but a combination.\n\nAlternatively, the output is built by arranging transformed versions of each input element. For example, each element in the input is expanded into a 3x3 block. But the input is 3x2, so the output would be 9x6. But the examples have output as 9x4, so that's not matching.\n\nAlternatively, think of each input row as a 2-element array, and expanding each element into a 2-element part in the output row. But how?\n\nWait let's look at the output rows. For example0, the first output row is [8,0,0,8]. Let's split that into two parts: [8,0] and [0,8]. Which are the reversed elements of the input row. So [0,8] becomes reversed as [8,0], then mirrored to make [8,0,0,8]. So each input row is mirrored to create a 4-element row.\n\nThen, perhaps each input row is transformed into a 4-element row, and then those rows are stacked in a certain way, maybe repeated three times with some modification.\n\nBut example0's output is three copies of the three transformed rows. So for example, transformed rows are:\n\nRow0: [8,0,0,8]\n\nRow1: [0,0,0,0]\n\nRow2: [8,0,0,8]\n\nThen the output is this sequence repeated three times, resulting in 9 rows.\n\nBut why? That seems like the pattern is to take the transformed rows and repeat them three times. Similarly, example1's output is the same transformed rows repeated three times.\n\nBut in example2, the output is not a simple repetition. Let's see:\n\nTransformed rows for example2's input:\n\nRow0: [0,0] \u2192 reversed and mirrored \u2192 [0,0,0,0]\n\nRow1: [0,5] \u2192 reversed \u2192 [5,0], mirrored \u2192 [5,0,0,5]\n\nRow2: [5,0] \u2192 reversed \u2192 [0,5], mirrored \u2192 [0,5,5,0]\n\nSo transformed rows would be:\n\n[0,0,0,0]\n\n[5,0,0,5]\n\n[0,5,5,0]\n\nBut in example2's output, the rows are:\n\n[0,5,5,0]\n\n[5,0,0,5]\n\n[0,0,0,0]\n\nThen [0,0,0,0], [5,0,0,5], [0,5,5,0], and again [0,5,5,0], [5,0,0,5], [0,0,0,0]. So it's not a straightforward repetition of the three transformed rows. The order is different. So this approach may not be correct.\n\nHmm, maybe there's another pattern here.\n\nLooking at example2's output:\n\nThe output rows are:\n\n0: [0,5,5,0]\n\n1: [5,0,0,5]\n\n2: [0,0,0,0]\n\n3: [0,0,0,0]\n\n4: [5,0,0,5]\n\n5: [0,5,5,0]\n\n6: [0,5,5,0]\n\n7: [5,0,0,5]\n\n8: [0,0,0,0]\n\nThis looks like three groups of three rows each. The first group is rows 0-2, then 3-5, then 6-8.\n\nGroup1:\n\n0: [0,5,5,0]\n\n1: [5,0,0,5]\n\n2: [0,0,0,0]\n\nGroup2:\n\n3: [0,0,0,0]\n\n4: [5,0,0,5]\n\n5: [0,5,5,0]\n\nGroup3:\n\n6: [0,5,5,0]\n\n7: [5,0,0,5]\n\n8: [0,0,0,0]\n\nSo group1 is rows 0-2 of the output, which are the transformed input rows in the order row2, row1, row0 (since input row2 is [5,0], transformed to [0,5,5,0], which is row0 of group1. Input row1 is [0,5], transformed to [5,0,0,5], which is row1. Input row0 is [0,0], transformed to [0,0,0,0], row2. Then group2 is [0,0,0,0], [5,0,0,5], [0,5,5,0], which is row0, row1, row2 again. Group3 is same as group1.\n\nWait this seems inconsistent. Alternatively, maybe the output is formed by arranging the transformed input rows in a specific order, then repeating that sequence. But it's not clear.\n\nLet's try another angle. Let's see the input as a vertical sequence, and the output as a horizontal and vertical expansion.\n\nFor example, each element in the input is part of a 3x3 block in the output. But the output dimensions are 9x4, which is 3 times the input rows and 2 times the input columns. So perhaps each input element is expanded into a 3x2 block. But how?\n\nAlternatively, the input is transformed by mirroring each row horizontally, creating a 4-element row, then vertically stacking transformed versions. Let's think:\n\nEach input row [a, b] becomes [b, a, a, b], then perhaps each of these rows is repeated three times, with some modifications. For example, the first transformed row is [b,a,a,b], the second is [a,a,a,a] (if middle row?), and the third is again [b,a,a,b]. Then this trio is repeated three times for the entire output.\n\nBut how does that fit with the examples?\n\nIn example0, the first transformed row is [8,0,0,8]. The middle row of the trio is [0,0,0,0], which is derived from the input's middle row [0,0]. Then the third row is again [8,0,0,8]. So each input row is generating a trio of rows: the transformed row, then a row based on the middle input row, then the transformed row again. But why?\n\nWait example0 has three input rows. The output is structured such that each input row's transformed row is sandwiched around the middle input row's transformed row. But this doesn't fit directly.\n\nAnother approach: look at the positions of elements in the input and how they appear in the output.\n\nIn example0, the input has 0,8 in the first and third rows, and 0,0 in the middle. The output has 8s in the corners and 0s in the middle sections. So maybe the input is being used to create a kind of cross or symmetrical pattern.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is a combination of the input rows arranged in a certain pattern. For example, the output is constructed by taking each input row and its mirror, then combining them with other mirrored versions.\n\nAlternatively, think of the output as a larger matrix where each input element is placed in specific positions. For example, each element in the input is placed in a 3x3 grid in the output, with some replication.\n\nBut this is getting a bit stuck. Let me try to look for a pattern in the outputs for the test input.\n\nTest input:\n\n[3,3]\n\n[3,0]\n\n[3,3]\n\nWe need to apply the same transformation as the training examples to get a 9x4 output.\n\nFollowing the pattern from the training examples:\n\nEach input row [a, b] is transformed into [b, a, a, b]. Then, these transformed rows are arranged in some way to form the output.\n\nBut the output has 9 rows, so each input row must contribute three rows. Let's see:\n\nFor the test input:\n\nInput rows:\n\nRow0: [3,3]\n\nRow1: [3,0]\n\nRow2: [3,3]\n\nTransform each row:\n\nRow0 transformed: [3,3,3,3] (since [3,3] \u2192 [3,3,3,3])\n\nRow1 transformed: [0,3,3,0] (since [3,0] \u2192 [0,3,3,0])\n\nRow2 transformed: [3,3,3,3]\n\nThen, if the pattern is to repeat each transformed row three times, the output would be:\n\n[3,3,3,3]\n\n[0,3,3,0]\n\n[3,3,3,3]\n\nRepeated three times. But looking at the examples:\n\nIn example0, the transformed rows are [8,0,0,8], [0,0,0,0], [8,0,0,8], and the output is these three rows repeated three times. So for the test input, the transformed rows would be [3,3,3,3], [0,3,3,0], [3,3,3,3], and then repeated three times. But let's see.\n\nBut in example2, the transformed rows are [0,5,5,0], [5,0,0,5], [0,0,0,0], and the output is a different arrangement. So perhaps the pattern is that the transformed rows are arranged in a certain order and then repeated.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by creating a vertical stack of the transformed input matrix and its rotations or reflections.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is generated by combining the transformed rows in a specific order, such as row0, row1, row2, row0, row1, row2, row0, row1, row2. But example0's output is row0, row1, row2, repeated three times, which fits. For example0, that's correct. For example1, same pattern.\n\nBut example2's output doesn't fit this. The first three rows of example2's output are [0,5,5,0], [5,0,0,5], [0,0,0,0], which correspond to transformed row2, row1, row0. Then the next three are transformed row0, row1, row2 again. Wait, no. Let's check:\n\nExample2's input rows are:\n\nRow0: [0,0] \u2192 transformed [0,0,0,0]\n\nRow1: [0,5] \u2192 transformed [5,0,0,5]\n\nRow2: [5,0] \u2192 transformed [0,5,5,0]\n\nSo transformed rows are:\n\nT0: [0,0,0,0]\n\nT1: [5,0,0,5]\n\nT2: [0,5,5,0]\n\nBut the output's first three rows are [0,5,5,0], [5,0,0,5], [0,0,0,0], which is T2, T1, T0.\n\nThen the next three rows are T0, T1, T2? No, looking at the output rows:\n\nOutput rows:\n\n0: [0,5,5,0] \u2192 T2\n\n1: [5,0,0,5] \u2192 T1\n\n2: [0,0,0,0] \u2192 T0\n\n3: [0,0,0,0] \u2192 T0\n\n4: [5,0,0,5] \u2192 T1\n\n5: [0,5,5,0] \u2192 T2\n\n6: [0,5,5,0] \u2192 T2\n\n7: [5,0,0,5] \u2192 T1\n\n8: [0,0,0,0] \u2192 T0\n\nSo the first three rows are T2, T1, T0.\n\nThe next three are T0, T1, T2.\n\nThe last three are T2, T1, T0.\n\nSo the order is T2-T1-T0, then T0-T1-T2, then T2-T1-T0 again. That's a bit irregular. So this complicates the pattern.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is generated by rotating the order of the transformed rows. For example, the first three rows are the transformed rows in the order row2, row1, row0; the next three in row0, row1, row2; and the last three again row2, row1, row0. But this seems specific to example2 and not general.\n\nBut example0 and example1 have their outputs as the transformed rows in the original order, repeated three times. So why is example2 different?\n\nLooking back, example0's input rows are [0,8], [0,0], [0,8]. The transformed rows are [8,0,0,8], [0,0,0,0], [8,0,0,8]. The output is these three rows repeated three times. So it's the same order each time.\n\nExample1's input rows are [2,0], [2,2], [2,0]. Transformed rows are [0,2,2,0], [2,2,2,2], [0,2,2,0], repeated three times.\n\nExample2's input rows are [0,0], [0,5], [5,0], transformed rows [0,0,0,0], [5,0,0,5], [0,5,5,0]. But the output has the first three rows as [0,5,5,0], [5,0,0,5], [0,0,0,0], which is transformed rows in reverse order: T2, T1, T0. Then the next three are T0, T1, T2. Then again T2, T1, T0. \n\nSo the pattern here seems to vary. How can we reconcile this?\n\nMaybe the output is generated by applying a certain transformation to the entire input matrix, such as rotating it or reflecting it, and then combining those transformations.\n\nFor example, the output could be the original transformed matrix, followed by a vertically flipped version, followed by the original again. Let's check example2:\n\nTransformed input rows (original order):\n\nT0: [0,0,0,0]\n\nT1: [5,0,0,5]\n\nT2: [0,5,5,0]\n\nVertically flipped would be T2, T1, T0.\n\nSo if the output is original + vertical flip + original, then the rows would be:\n\nOriginal: T0, T1, T2 \u2192 no, example2's first three rows are T2, T1, T0.\n\nHmm. Alternatively, maybe the output is the transformed matrix followed by its vertical flip, followed by transformed matrix again. But in example0 and example1, the transformed matrix is the same as its vertical flip, so output is three copies. In example2, the transformed matrix is different when flipped, so the output is T2-T1-T0, then T0-T1-T2, then T2-T1-T0 again. But why would that be?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is generated by taking the transformed rows in the order row0, row1, row2, then row2, row1, row0, then row0, row1, row2. But example0's output is three times row0, row1, row2, which fits if the first and third segments are the same. But example2's output has the first and third segments as row2, row1, row0, and the middle segment as row0, row1, row2.\n\nBut how to determine when to reverse the order? Looking at the input matrices:\n\nIn example0, the first and third rows are the same. So when reversed, they stay the same. Similarly, example1's first and third rows are the same. Example2's first and third rows are different. So maybe the output alternates between the original order and reversed order based on whether the first and third rows are the same.\n\nIf the first and third input rows are the same, then the output is three copies of the transformed rows. If they are different, then the output is a combination of reversed and original orders.\n\nBut how does this fit with example2?\n\nExample2's first and third rows are [0,0] and [5,0], which are different. So the output is a mix of reversed and original orders. \n\nSo the pattern could be:\n\nIf the first and third input rows are the same:\n\n- Output is transformed rows (T0, T1, T2) repeated three times.\n\nIf they are different:\n\n- Output is (T2, T1, T0) followed by (T0, T1, T2) followed by (T2, T1, T0).\n\nBut in example2's output, the first three rows are T2, T1, T0, then the next three are T0, T1, T2, then T2, T1, T0 again. So the order is reversed, original, reversed. \n\nBut this seems a bit ad hoc. Maybe there's another pattern.\n\nAlternatively, the output is constructed by creating a 3x3 grid where each cell is a transformed row. For example, the first row of the grid is T0, T0, T0; the second row is T1, T1, T1; the third row is T2, T2, T2. But the output is 9 rows, which would mean 3 rows per grid row. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, the output is a combination of the transformed matrix, then the transformed matrix with rows reversed, then the transformed matrix again. For example:\n\nExample0's output is T0, T1, T2, T0, T1, T2, T0, T1, T2.\n\nExample1's output is same as above.\n\nExample2's output is T2, T1, T0, T0, T1, T2, T2, T1, T0.\n\nBut this doesn't fit exactly. Example2's output is:\n\nRows 0-2: T2, T1, T0\n\nRows 3-5: T0, T1, T2\n\nRows 6-8: T2, T1, T0\n\nSo it's a pattern of reversed, original, reversed. \n\nBut how to determine when to apply this? It seems the key difference is whether the first and third input rows are the same. In example0 and example1, they are the same. In example2, they are different.\n\nSo the pattern could be:\n\n- If the first and third input rows are identical, then output is three copies of the transformed rows in original order.\n\n- If the first and third input rows are different, output is (T2, T1, T0), (T0, T1, T2), (T2, T1, T0).\n\nBut how does example2's input rows compare? The first and third rows are [0,0] and [5,0], which are different. So the output follows the second pattern.\n\nApplying this to the test input:\n\nTest input:\n\nRow0: [3,3]\n\nRow1: [3,0]\n\nRow2: [3,3]\n\nHere, the first and third rows are the same ([3,3]). So according to the pattern, the output should be three copies of the transformed rows in original order.\n\nTransformed rows:\n\nT0: [3,3,3,3] (from [3,3] \u2192 [3,3,3,3])\n\nT1: [0,3,3,0] (from [3,0] \u2192 [0,3,3,0])\n\nT2: [3,3,3,3]\n\nSo output rows would be:\n\n[3,3,3,3]\n\n[0,3,3,0]\n\n[3,3,3,3]\n\nRepeated three times. Let's see:\n\nFirst three rows:\n\n[3,3,3,3]\n\n[0,3,3,0]\n\n[3,3,3,3]\n\nNext three rows:\n\n[3,3,3,3]\n\n[0,3,3,0]\n\n[3,3,3,3]\n\nFinal three rows:\n\n[3,3,3,3]\n\n[0,3,3,0]\n\n[3,3,3,3]\n\nSo the full output would be nine rows as above.\n\nBut looking at the training examples, example0 and example1 have their outputs as the transformed rows repeated three times. So this seems to fit.\n\nTherefore, the test input's output should be the transformed rows T0, T1, T2 repeated three times.",

        "cot_2": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. So, there are these training examples where an input 3x2 grid is transformed into a 9x4 grid. Hmm, wait, no, looking closer, the input is three rows each with two elements, and the output is nine rows each with four elements. So the output is three times as many rows and twice as many columns.\n\nLet me look at the examples one by one. Starting with Example 0. The input is:\n\n[0,8]\n[0,0]\n[0,8]\n\nAnd the output is a 9x4 grid. Let me see how each part of the input maps to the output. The output has a certain symmetry. Looking at the first three rows of the output:\n\n[8,0,0,8]\n[0,0,0,0]\n[8,0,0,8]\n\nThen this pattern repeats three times. Wait, the output has 9 rows. So maybe each row of the input is generating three rows in the output, and each element is being expanded into two columns?\n\nWait, let's take Example 0. The input is three rows, each with two numbers. The output has 9 rows (3x3) and 4 columns (2x2). So perhaps each input element is transformed into a 3x2 block, but arranged in a way that expands the entire grid into 3x3 blocks for each original element?\n\nAlternatively, maybe each input row is generating three output rows, and each element is generating two columns. Let's see. For instance, the first input row is [0,8], which might correspond to the first three rows of the output. The output starts with [8,0,0,8], then [0,0,0,0], then [8,0,0,8]. So maybe each element in the input is being mirrored and arranged in a 3x2 pattern, then combined with adjacent elements?\n\nAlternatively, looking at the output structure, perhaps each input element is generating a 3x2 block. For example, in Example 0's input, the first row is [0,8]. The first three rows of the output are:\n\n[8,0,0,8]\n[0,0,0,0]\n[8,0,0,8]\n\nWait, the first element in the input is 0, and the second is 8. In the output row, the first two elements are 8 and 0, then 0 and 8. That looks like a mirror image. So 0 and 8 become [8,0,0,8]. Hmm. Maybe each pair in the input is reversed and mirrored to form a 4-element row. Then the middle row is all zeros. Then again the same mirrored row. So each input row becomes three rows in the output, with the middle row being zeros if the original row's elements are the same, or something else?\n\nWait, Example 0's first input row is [0,8]. The output for that part is three rows: [8,0,0,8], [0,0,0,0], [8,0,0,8]. So the middle row is all zeros. Maybe the middle row's elements are the sum of the original elements? Wait, 0+8=8, but the middle row is zeros. Not sure.\n\nLooking at Example 1. The input is [2,0], [2,2], [2,0]. The output starts with [0,2,2,0], then [2,2,2,2], then [0,2,2,0], and repeats this three times. So for the first input row [2,0], the output rows are [0,2,2,0], then [2,2,2,2], then [0,2,2,0]. So here, the middle row is all 2s, which might correspond to the sum of 2 and 0, but 2+0=2, but the row is filled with 2s. Alternatively, maybe the middle row is the maximum of the two numbers, but 2 is the max here. Or maybe it's the first number, but in this case, the first number is 2 and the middle row is all 2s. Similarly, in Example 0, the original elements were 0 and 8. The middle row is all zeros. So maybe the middle row's elements are the first element of the pair. So for [0,8], middle row is 0s. For [2,0], the middle row is 2s. Hmm, that seems possible. Let's check Example 2.\n\nExample 2's input is [0,0], [0,5], [5,0]. The output starts with [0,5,5,0], [5,0,0,5], [0,0,0,0], then repeats. Wait, the first input row is [0,0]. The first three output rows are [0,5,5,0], [5,0,0,5], [0,0,0,0]. Wait, that's different. Maybe this isn't directly mapping the input rows. Wait, perhaps there's a different pattern here. Let's look at the input structure and how it's transformed.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each input row is transformed into three output rows, and each input column is transformed into two output columns. So the input is 3x2, which becomes 9 rows (3x3) and 4 columns (2x2). So each element is part of a 3x3 block for rows and 2x2 for columns. Wait, perhaps the output is created by taking each element in the input and generating a 3x2 grid, then combining them. But how?\n\nAlternatively, let's look at the output as a larger grid. For example, in Example 0's output, the first three rows are:\n\n8 0 0 8\n\n0 0 0 0\n\n8 0 0 8\n\nThen the next three rows are the same as the first three, then again. So perhaps each input row is generating three output rows, and each input column is generating two columns. Wait, but how does [0,8] become [8,0,0,8]?\n\nAlternatively, the input's elements are arranged in a mirrored way. For example, in the first input row of Example 0 [0,8], the output row starts with 8, 0, 0, 8. That's the reverse of the input elements repeated. So 8,0 (reverse of 0,8) followed by 0,8. Then the next row is all zeros. Then the same as the first. So maybe each input row generates three output rows where the first and third are the reversed pair followed by the original pair, and the middle row is filled with the first element of the input pair. Wait, in Example 0's first input row [0,8], the middle row is all zeros. The first and third rows are 8,0,0,8. So that's reversed [8,0] followed by [0,8]. So the reversed pair plus the original pair, making four elements. Then the middle row is filled with the first element of the input row. So 0 in this case. Similarly, in Example 1's first input row [2,0], the reversed pair is 0,2 followed by 2,0. Wait, no. The output row is [0,2,2,0]. So that's 0,2 followed by 2,0. Wait, that's the reverse of the original pair and then the original pair? No, the original pair is 2,0. The reversed is 0,2. So [0,2] followed by [2,0] would be 0,2,2,0. Which is the output. Then the middle row is filled with 2s, which is the first element of the input row. So yes, that seems to fit. Let's test this hypothesis.\n\nSo for each input row [a, b], the corresponding three output rows would be:\n\nRow 1: reversed pair [b, a], then original pair [a, b]? Wait, no. Wait in Example 0, input [0,8], output row is [8,0,0,8]. So that's [8,0] followed by [0,8]. Which is reversed pair followed by original pair. Then the middle row is filled with a (0), so [0,0,0,0]. Then the third row is same as the first. So each input row generates three output rows: reversed + original, then all a's, then reversed + original again. Then, perhaps each input row is tripled in the output rows, but arranged as three rows. Then, the entire input's three rows would generate 9 output rows (3x3). But how does the vertical arrangement work?\n\nWait, let's see for Example 0:\n\nInput rows:\n\nRow 0: [0,8]\n\nRow 1: [0,0]\n\nRow 2: [0,8]\n\nEach input row generates three output rows. So 3 input rows \u00d73 =9 output rows.\n\nSo for input row [a,b], the three output rows are:\n\nRow 1: [b, a, a, b]\n\nRow 2: [a, a, a, a]\n\nRow 3: [b, a, a, b]\n\nWait, in Example 0:\n\nRow 0 input is [0,8]. Output rows for this would be:\n\n[8,0, 0,8], [0,0,0,0], [8,0,0,8]\n\nWhich matches the first three rows of the output.\n\nThen the next input row is [0,0], which would generate:\n\n[0,0,0,0], [0,0,0,0], [0,0,0,0]\n\nBut looking at the output of Example 0, the next three rows after the first three are:\n\n[8,0,0,8]\n\n[0,0,0,0]\n\n[8,0,0,8]\n\nWait, but that's the same as the first three. So this doesn't fit. Unless there's a different pattern. Because in Example 0's output, the first three rows are from the first input row, then the next three from the second, then the next three from the third. But in Example 0's output, the rows after the first three are again the same as the first three. So that can't be right.\n\nHmm, maybe the output is arranged such that each input row is generating three output rows, but all three input rows are processed in a way that their outputs are interleaved. Or perhaps the entire input is transformed into a 3x3 grid of blocks, each block being 3 rows and 2 columns, but then expanded. Wait, maybe each element in the input grid is being replaced by a 3x2 block, and arranged in a way that creates the larger grid.\n\nWait, for example, input is 3 rows \u00d72 columns. Output is 9 rows \u00d74 columns. So 3\u00d73 rows and 2\u00d72 columns. So each original element becomes a 3x2 block.\n\nLooking at Example 0's input:\n\nOriginal element at (0,0) is 0.\n\nIn the output, the top-left 3x2 block (rows 0-2, columns 0-1) would be:\n\nRow0: 8,0\n\nRow1:0,0\n\nRow2:8,0\n\nWait, but how does 0 become this block? It's unclear.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the entire grid is mirrored and expanded. For example, each element is duplicated in some way. Let's look at the first example again. The input is three rows of [0,8], [0,0], [0,8]. The output is a pattern that seems to mirror these values. The first row of the output is [8,0,0,8], which is the reverse of [0,8] followed by [0,8]. Then the next row is all zeros, then the same as the first. Then this entire three-row block is repeated three times. Wait, but Example 0's output has 9 rows. So the first three rows are [8,0,0,8], [0,0,0,0], [8,0,0,8], then the same again, then again. So it's like each input row is generating a 3-row block, and the entire input's three rows are generating three such 3-row blocks. But then why is the same block repeated three times? That doesn't fit unless the pattern is to repeat each row's block three times.\n\nBut in Example 1, the input is [2,0], [2,2], [2,0]. The output is three blocks of [0,2,2,0], [2,2,2,2], [0,2,2,0], repeated three times. So each input row's block is generated and repeated thrice. But that would mean that the output is three copies of each input row's block. But how does that fit with the input rows? For instance, in Example 1, the input has three rows. The output's 9 rows are three repetitions of the three-row block generated by the first input row? Or perhaps each input row's block is repeated once per row. But that's not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the entire input grid is mirrored both horizontally and vertically to create the output. For example, the input is 3x2. Mirroring it vertically would make it 3x2 again, and mirroring horizontally would make it 3x2. Combining them might create a 3x4 grid, but then how to get to 9 rows?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each input element is replaced by a 3x2 block where the value is determined by the original element. For instance, in Example 0, the 0s and 8s. Looking at the output for Example 0, the 8s are in positions where the original element was 8, and 0s elsewhere. Wait, but the blocks are more complex. Let's see.\n\nAnother approach: look for the positions of the original elements in the output. For example, in Example 1's input, the first row is [2,0]. The output's first three rows are [0,2,2,0], [2,2,2,2], [0,2,2,0]. So maybe the original elements are placed in the middle of their respective blocks. The 2 in the input is at (0,0), and in the output's second row of the first block, all are 2s. The 0 is at (0,1), and the middle row has 2s. Hmm, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is created by tiling the input in some way, with transformations. For instance, each row is duplicated three times, and each element is expanded into two columns, with some transformation. Let's see. For Example 0's first input row [0,8], if duplicated three times as rows, each row would be transformed into two columns. But the output rows are different.\n\nWait, let's think of each input element as being part of a 3x3 block in the output. For example, each element in the input grid is expanded into a 3x3 block. Then, the output would be 3x3 blocks arranged in a 3x2 grid of blocks, leading to 9 rows and 6 columns. But the output is 9x4, so that's not matching. Alternatively, perhaps each input element is expanded into a 3x2 block, and arranged in a way that combines them. For example, each input row (2 elements) becomes 3 rows, each with 4 elements (2x2 blocks). So each element in the input row becomes a 3x2 block, and the two blocks are placed side by side. But then each input row would generate 3 rows of 4 elements (since two 3x2 blocks side by side would be 3 rows \u00d7 (2+2) columns). That could work. Let's check Example 0.\n\nInput row 0: [0,8]. Each element becomes a 3x2 block. For 0: perhaps a 3x2 block of 8s? Wait, no. Because the output rows for Example 0's first input row are [8,0,0,8], [0,0,0,0], [8,0,0,8]. So for each element, the block is 3 rows high. Let's split this into two 3x2 blocks. The first two elements of each output row are from the first input element (0) and the next two from the second input element (8). So for the first input element 0, the 3x2 block would be:\n\n8,0\n\n0,0\n\n8,0\n\nAnd the second input element 8's block would be:\n\n0,8\n\n0,0\n\n0,8\n\nWait, combining these side by side gives:\n\n8 0 | 0 8\n\n0 0 | 0 0\n\n8 0 | 0 8\n\nWhich is the first three rows of the output. So each input element is transformed into a 3x2 block where the first row is [b, a], the middle row is [a, a], and the third row is [b, a], where a is the original element, and b is some value derived from it. But wait, in Example 0, the original element is 0. The corresponding block for 0 is:\n\n8 0 \n\n0 0 \n\n8 0 \n\nBut where does the 8 come from? Because the original element is 0. That doesn't fit. Alternatively, perhaps the value of the element is replaced by the sum with its neighbors? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that each element is replaced by a 3x2 block where the first row is the reverse of the original pair, and then the original pair again. For example, in Example 0's first row [0,8], the reversed pair is [8,0], then original [0,8], making [8,0,0,8] as the first row. The middle row is all zeros. Third row same as first. But how does this apply to other elements?\n\nWait, looking at Example 1's input [2,0]. The first output row is [0,2,2,0]. Which is reversed [0,2] followed by original [2,0]. Then middle row is [2,2,2,2]. So here, the reversed pair is [0,2], followed by original [2,0], making [0,2,2,0]. Middle row is all 2s, which is the first element of the input pair. Third row same as first.\n\nSo the pattern for each input row [a, b] would be:\n\nRow 1: [b, a, a, b]\n\nRow 2: [a, a, a, a]\n\nRow 3: [b, a, a, b]\n\nWait, no. For Example 1, input row [2,0], the first output row is [0,2,2,0]. So reversed pair is [0,2], followed by original [2,0], which gives [0,2,2,0]. Then the middle row is [2,2,2,2], which is all a's (since a is 2 here). Then the third row is again [0,2,2,0]. So this seems to fit.\n\nSimilarly, for Example 0's input row [0,8], the first output row would be [8,0, 0,8], middle row [0,0,0,0], third row [8,0,0,8]. So yes, that matches.\n\nThen for Example 2's input row [0,5], let's see. The output rows for that input row would be [5,0,0,5], [0,0,0,0], [5,0,0,5]. But looking at the output for Example 2, the first three rows are [0,5,5,0], [5,0,0,5], [0,0,0,0]. Wait, this seems different. Hmm. Wait, Example 2's input is:\n\nRow 0: [0,0]\n\nRow 1: [0,5]\n\nRow 2: [5,0]\n\nThe output's first three rows are:\n\n[0,5,5,0]\n\n[5,0,0,5]\n\n[0,0,0,0]\n\nThen the next three rows are [0,0,0,0], [5,0,0,5], [0,5,5,0]. Wait, this is confusing. Let me check Example 2's output again.\n\nExample 2's OUTPUT:\n\n[0,5,5,0]\n\n[5,0,0,5]\n\n[0,0,0,0]\n\n[0,0,0,0]\n\n[5,0,0,5]\n\n[0,5,5,0]\n\n[0,5,5,0]\n\n[5,0,0,5]\n\n[0,0,0,0]\n\nSo the first three rows: [0,5,5,0], [5,0,0,5], [0,0,0,0]. Then next three: [0,0,0,0], [5,0,0,5], [0,5,5,0]. Then next three: [0,5,5,0], [5,0,0,5], [0,0,0,0].\n\nHmm, this doesn't fit the previous pattern. Because according to the earlier hypothesis, each input row should generate three output rows. For example, the input row [0,5] (which is the second row in the input) would generate three rows. Let's see:\n\nInput row [0,5] would generate:\n\nRow 1: [5,0,0,5]\n\nRow 2: [0,0,0,0]\n\nRow 3: [5,0,0,5]\n\nBut in the output, the second set of three rows (rows 3-5) are [0,0,0,0], [5,0,0,5], [0,5,5,0]. Which doesn't fit. So maybe the pattern is different. Alternatively, perhaps each input row and column are being processed in a way that involves more than just their own values. For example, maybe the values are being combined with their neighbors.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by mirroring the input grid both vertically and horizontally and combining them. Let's think: the input is a 3x2 grid. If mirrored horizontally, it becomes 3x2 again. Then mirrored vertically, it becomes 6x2. Then combined with the original, maybe. But the output is 9x4, which is more complex.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each input element is replaced by a 3x2 block where the block's values are determined by some rule involving the element's value and position. For example, in Example 0's 0 and 8, maybe the block is filled with 8 if the original element is 0, and 0 if the original is 8. But that doesn't seem to hold in other examples.\n\nLet me try to find another approach. Let's look at the test input:\n\nTest Input:\n\n[3,3]\n\n[3,0]\n\n[3,3]\n\nExpected Output: ?\n\nAccording to the previous pattern, each input row [a,b] would generate three rows in the output:\n\nRow 1: [b,a,a,b]\n\nRow 2: [a,a,a,a]\n\nRow 3: [b,a,a,b]\n\nSo let's apply this to each row of the test input.\n\nFirst row of input: [3,3]\n\nOutput rows:\n\nRow1: [3,3,3,3] (since b is 3 and a is 3, so [3,3,3,3])\n\nRow2: [3,3,3,3]\n\nRow3: [3,3,3,3]\n\nSecond row of input: [3,0]\n\nRow1: [0,3,3,0]\n\nRow2: [3,3,3,3]\n\nRow3: [0,3,3,0]\n\nThird row of input: [3,3]\n\nSame as first row: three rows of [3,3,3,3]\n\nSo combining all three input rows, the output would be:\n\n[3,3,3,3]\n\n[3,3,3,3]\n\n[3,3,3,3]\n\n[0,3,3,0]\n\n[3,3,3,3]\n\n[0,3,3,0]\n\n[3,3,3,3]\n\n[3,3,3,3]\n\n[3,3,3,3]\n\nBut looking at the training examples, this might not fit. For example, in Example 1, the input rows are [2,0], [2,2], [2,0]. According to the same pattern, the first row generates:\n\n[0,2,2,0]\n\n[2,2,2,2]\n\n[0,2,2,0]\n\nThe second row [2,2] would generate:\n\n[2,2,2,2]\n\n[2,2,2,2]\n\n[2,2,2,2]\n\nThird row [2,0] same as first.\n\nWhich matches the output in Example 1.\n\nBut in the test input, the middle row is [3,0], which would generate three rows: [0,3,3,0], [3,3,3,3], [0,3,3,0]. So the output would be:\n\nFirst three rows from [3,3]: all [3,3,3,3]\n\nNext three from [3,0]: [0,3,3,0], [3,3,3,3], [0,3,3,0]\n\nNext three from [3,3]: all [3,3,3,3]\n\nSo combining these, the output would be:\n\n[3,3,3,3]\n\n[3,3,3,3]\n\n[3,3,3,3]\n\n[0,3,3,0]\n\n[3,3,3,3]\n\n[0,3,3,0]\n\n[3,3,3,3]\n\n[3,3,3,3]\n\n[3,3,3,3]\n\nBut let's check if this matches the training example's patterns.\n\nIn Example 0, the input rows are [0,8], [0,0], [0,8]. Applying the same pattern:\n\nFirst row [0,8] \u2192 [8,0,0,8], [0,0,0,0], [8,0,0,8]\n\nSecond row [0,0] \u2192 [0,0,0,0], [0,0,0,0], [0,0,0,0]\n\nThird row [0,8] \u2192 same as first.\n\nSo the output would be:\n\n[8,0,0,8]\n\n[0,0,0,0]\n\n[8,0,0,8]\n\n[0,0,0,0]\n\n[0,0,0,0]\n\n[0,0,0,0]\n\n[8,0,0,8]\n\n[0,0,0,0]\n\n[8,0,0,8]\n\nWhich matches the Example 0's output as given. So this pattern holds.\n\nThen the test input's output should follow this pattern. But according to this, the test input's output would have three blocks:\n\nFirst block (from [3,3]):\n\n[3,3,3,3]\n\n[3,3,3,3]\n\n[3,3,3,3]\n\nSecond block (from [3,0]):\n\n[0,3,3,0]\n\n[3,3,3,3]\n\n[0,3,3,0]\n\nThird block (from [3,3]):\n\n[3,3,3,3]\n\n[3,3,3,3]\n\n[3,3,3,3]\n\nSo combining these nine rows, the output should be:\n\n[3,3,3,3]\n\n[3,3,3,3]\n\n[3,3,3,3]\n\n[0,3,3,0]\n\n[3,3,3,3]\n\n[0,3,3,0]\n\n[3,3,3,3]\n\n[3,3,3,3]\n\n[3,3,3,3]\n\nBut let's check if this aligns with any of the training examples. However, in Example 2, there's a different pattern. Let me re-examine Example 2.\n\nExample 2's input:\n\n[0,0]\n\n[0,5]\n\n[5,0]\n\nThe output is:\n\n[0,5,5,0]\n\n[5,0,0,5]\n\n[0,0,0,0]\n\n[0,0,0,0]\n\n[5,0,0,5]\n\n[0,5,5,0]\n\n[0,5,5,0]\n\n[5,0,0,5]\n\n[0,0,0,0]\n\nAccording to the previous pattern, each input row should generate three rows. Let's apply the same rule.\n\nFirst row [0,0]:\n\nRow1: [0,0,0,0] (b, a, a, b where a=0, b=0)\n\nRow2: [0,0,0,0]\n\nRow3: [0,0,0,0]\n\nSecond row [0,5]:\n\nRow1: [5,0,0,5]\n\nRow2: [0,0,0,0]\n\nRow3: [5,0,0,5]\n\nThird row [5,0]:\n\nRow1: [0,5,5,0]\n\nRow2: [5,5,5,5]\n\nRow3: [0,5,5,0]\n\nBut according to the example's output, the first three rows are:\n\n[0,5,5,0]\n\n[5,0,0,5]\n\n[0,0,0,0]\n\nThis doesn't match the expected pattern. Wait, this suggests that the pattern may be different. Because according to the previous hypothesis, the second input row [0,5] would generate three rows: [5,0,0,5], [0,0,0,0], [5,0,0,5]. But in the actual output, the first three rows are [0,5,5,0], [5,0,0,5], [0,0,0,0]. Which seems to correspond to the third input row [5,0]'s transformation. So maybe there's a vertical component to the pattern. For example, each input row is combined with the next row to generate output blocks. Or perhaps the entire input is considered as a 3x2 matrix, and the output is generated by some matrix operation, like a Kronecker product with a certain kernel.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is generated by tiling the input in a specific mirrored fashion. For example, the input is mirrored along both axes. Let me try to visualize:\n\nFor Example 2's input:\n\n0 0\n\n0 5\n\n5 0\n\nIf mirrored horizontally, it becomes:\n\n0 0\n\n5 0\n\n0 5\n\nBut combining with the original, perhaps arranging them in a way that forms the output. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the output may be a combination of the input and its transpose, but scaled. Let's compute the transpose of the input. The input is 3x2, so transpose is 2x3:\n\n0 0 5\n\n0 5 0\n\nBut how this would combine into a 9x4 matrix is unclear.\n\nAlternatively, the output is the result of some convolution or pattern that involves each element and its neighbors. For instance, each element in the output is derived from the corresponding input elements in a certain way.\n\nAlternatively, considering that in Example 2's output, the first row is [0,5,5,0], which is the third input row [5,0] transformed as [0,5,5,0]. Then the second row is [5,0,0,5], which is the second input row [0,5] transformed as [5,0,0,5]. Then the third row is all zeros, which is the first input row [0,0] transformed as [0,0,0,0]. Then this pattern repeats. So perhaps the output rows are generated by taking the input rows in reverse order, transforming each, then appending them. But how?\n\nThis is getting complicated. Let's go back to the previous hypothesis and see where it fails. For Example 2's input row [5,0], according to the earlier rule, the three output rows should be [0,5,5,0], [5,5,5,5], [0,5,5,0]. But in the actual output, the first three rows are [0,5,5,0], [5,0,0,5], [0,0,0,0]. So this doesn't fit. So the previous pattern holds for Examples 0 and 1 but not for Example 2. Therefore, there must be a different pattern.\n\nAlternative approach: look at the positions in the output matrix and see if they relate to the input positions.\n\nFor Example 2's output:\n\nRow 0: [0,5,5,0] \u2192 perhaps this is the third input row [5,0] transformed as [0,5,5,0].\n\nRow 1: [5,0,0,5] \u2192 perhaps the second input row [0,5] transformed as [5,0,0,5].\n\nRow 2: [0,0,0,0] \u2192 first input row [0,0] transformed as [0,0,0,0].\n\nThen rows 3-5 are [0,0,0,0], [5,0,0,5], [0,5,5,0], which is the first input row transformed, then the second, then third.\n\nRows 6-8: [0,5,5,0], [5,0,0,5], [0,0,0,0], which is third, second, first.\n\nSo the output is a combination of the input rows in different orders. So the first three rows are third, second, first. Next three are first, second, third. Next three are third, second, first. This creates a vertical mirroring of the input.\n\nSo the output is structured in three sections, each three rows long:\n\nSection 1: rows 0-2 \u2192 input rows reversed: row2, row1, row0.\n\nSection 2: rows 3-5 \u2192 input rows as is: row0, row1, row2.\n\nSection 3: rows 6-8 \u2192 input rows reversed again: row2, row1, row0.\n\nBut wait, looking at Example 2's output:\n\nSection 1:\n\n0,5,5,0 \u2192 row2 (5,0)\n\n5,0,0,5 \u2192 row1 (0,5)\n\n0,0,0,0 \u2192 row0 (0,0)\n\nSection 2:\n\n0,0,0,0 \u2192 row0\n\n5,0,0,5 \u2192 row1\n\n0,5,5,0 \u2192 row2\n\nSection 3:\n\n0,5,5,0 \u2192 row2\n\n5,0,0,5 \u2192 row1\n\n0,0,0,0 \u2192 row0\n\nSo the sections are arranged as row2, row1, row0 \u2192 row0, row1, row2 \u2192 row2, row1, row0. \n\nThen each of these sections is generated by transforming each row as per the earlier pattern (reversed pair followed by original pair for first and third rows, middle row is a's).\n\nSo the overall pattern seems to be:\n\nThe output consists of three vertical sections, each being three rows. The sections are ordered as reversed input rows, original input rows, reversed input rows again.\n\nEach input row is transformed into three output rows as per the earlier pattern: for each input row [a,b], create three output rows:\n\n1. [b,a,a,b]\n\n2. [a,a,a,a]\n\n3. [b,a,a,b]\n\nThen, arrange these transformed rows in the order of reversed input rows, original input rows, reversed input rows.\n\nLet's check this with Example 2.\n\nExample 2's input rows:\n\nRow0: [0,0]\n\nRow1: [0,5]\n\nRow2: [5,0]\n\nReversed input rows (row2, row1, row0):\n\nRow2: [5,0]\n\nRow1: [0,5]\n\nRow0: [0,0]\n\nTransform each of these:\n\nRow2 transformed:\n\nRow1: [0,5,5,0]\n\nRow2: [5,5,5,5]\n\nRow3: [0,5,5,0]\n\nRow1 transformed:\n\nRow1: [5,0,0,5]\n\nRow2: [0,0,0,0]\n\nRow3: [5,0,0,5]\n\nRow0 transformed:\n\nRow1: [0,0,0,0]\n\nRow2: [0,0,0,0]\n\nRow3: [0,0,0,0]\n\nSo the first section (reversed input rows) would be:\n\n[0,5,5,0]\n\n[5,5,5,5]\n\n[0,5,5,0]\n\n[5,0,0,5]\n\n[0,0,0,0]\n\n[5,0,0,5]\n\n[0,0,0,0]\n\n[0,0,0,0]\n\n[0,0,0,0]\n\nWait, no. Wait each reversed input row (row2, row1, row0) is transformed into three rows. So:\n\nRow2: [5,0] \u2192 transforms to:\n\n[0,5,5,0]\n\n[5,5,5,5]\n\n[0,5,5,0]\n\nRow1: [0,5] \u2192 transforms to:\n\n[5,0,0,5]\n\n[0,0,0,0]\n\n[5,0,0,5]\n\nRow0: [0,0] \u2192 transforms to:\n\n[0,0,0,0]\n\n[0,0,0,0]\n\n[0,0,0,0]\n\nSo the first section (reversed rows) would be the transformation of row2, row1, row0, resulting in:\n\n[0,5,5,0]\n\n[5,5,5,5]\n\n[0,5,5,0]\n\n[5,0,0,5]\n\n[0,0,0,0]\n\n[5,0,0,5]\n\n[0,0,0,0]\n\n[0,0,0,0]\n\n[0,0,0,0]\n\nBut Example 2's output doesn't match this. The first three rows of the output are:\n\n[0,5,5,0]\n\n[5,0,0,5]\n\n[0,0,0,0]\n\nWhich suggests that perhaps the transformation is different. Maybe the middle row of each transformed block is the sum of a and b, or something else.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the middle row is derived from the original row's first element, but in Example 2's row2 [5,0], a is 5, so the middle row would be [5,5,5,5]. But in the output, the second row of the first section is [5,0,0,5], which is not all 5s. So this contradicts the previous hypothesis.\n\nThis suggests that the pattern is more complex and involves interactions between neighboring elements or different transformation rules.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider that each element in the input is part of a 3x3 block in the output. For example, each element is expanded into a 3x3 block. But how?\n\nAnother angle: the output in Example 2 has 9 rows, which is 3 times the input's 3 rows. So each input row generates three output rows. But the way they generate depends on more than just the row's own elements. Let's look at Example 2's output rows:\n\nRow0: [0,5,5,0] \u2192 could correspond to input row2 [5,0]\n\nRow1: [5,0,0,5] \u2192 corresponds to input row1 [0,5]\n\nRow2: [0,0,0,0] \u2192 corresponds to input row0 [0,0]\n\nThen the next three rows are the same as the first three but shifted, which suggests that the output is a cyclic permutation of the input rows. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the input and applying a vertical flip, then transforming each row. For example, the input rows are [0,0], [0,5], [5,0]. Flipping vertically gives [5,0], [0,5], [0,0]. Then transforming each row as before. But how does this fit into the output structure?\n\nIt's possible that the pattern involves a combination of transforming each row as per the earlier hypothesis and then arranging them in a specific order. For Example 2, the output's first three rows are the transformed versions of the input's rows in reverse order (row2, row1, row0), followed by row0, row1, row2, and then row2, row1, row0 again. But how does this fit with the output's structure?\n\nGiven the time I've spent and the possible time constraints, I'll proceed with the initial pattern that worked for Examples 0 and 1, and see if it fits for the test input.\n\nFor the test input:\n\n[3,3]\n\n[3,0]\n\n[3,3]\n\nEach input row transforms to three output rows as follows:\n\nRow0 [3,3]:\n\n[b,a,a,b] \u2192 3,3,3,3\n\n[a,a,a,a] \u2192 3,3,3,3\n\n[b,a,a,b] \u2192 3,3,3,3\n\nRow1 [3,0]:\n\n[b,a,a,b] \u2192 0,3,3,0\n\n[a,a,a,a] \u21923,3,3,3\n\n[b,a,a,b] \u21920,3,3,0\n\nRow2 [3,3]:\n\n same as row0.\n\nSo the output would be:\n\nRow0's three rows:\n\n[3,3,3,3]\n\n[3,3,3,3]\n\n[3,3,3,3]\n\nRow1's three rows:\n\n[0,3,3,0]\n\n[3,3,3,3]\n\n[0,3,3,0]\n\nRow2's three rows:\n\n[3,3,3,3]\n\n[3,3,3,3]\n\n[3,3,3,3]\n\nSo the entire output is:\n\n[3,3,3,3]\n\n[3,3,3,3]\n\n[3,3,3,3]\n\n[0,3,3,0]\n\n[3,3,3,3]\n\n[0,3,3,0]\n\n[3,3,3,3]\n\n[3,3,3,3]\n\n[3,3,3,3]\n\nWhich matches the pattern observed in Examples 0 and 1. However, this doesn't match Example 2's structure, which suggests that there might be an exception based on certain conditions. But given that the test input's middle row is [3,0], similar to Example 1's [2,0], which follows the pattern, it's likely that the intended pattern is the one where each input row generates three output rows as per the initial hypothesis, and the entire output is the concatenation of these transformed rows.\n\nTherefore, applying this pattern to the test input, the correct output should be as outlined above."
