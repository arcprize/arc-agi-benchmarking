        "cot_1": "Okay, let's see here. I need to figure out the pattern from the training examples to apply it to the test input. Let me look at each example carefully.\n\nStarting with Example 0:\nInput has three rows:\n[9,1,4]\n[9,1,4]\n[2,1,1]\n\nOutput is six rows, repeating the input rows but in a certain order. The original three are there, then the third row is repeated again, then the second, then the first? Wait, looking at the output:\nOriginal three lines, then [2,1,1] again, then [9,1,4] twice. Wait, no. The output is:\n\n[9,1,4]\n[9,1,4]\n[2,1,1]\n[2,1,1]\n[9,1,4]\n[9,1,4]\n\nSo after the original three rows, they add the third row again, then the second original row again, then the first again. Wait, but the original input has three rows. The output is the original three followed by the third row again, then the second, then the first. So the order after the original is 3rd, 2nd, 1st rows each repeated once? But in example 0's output, after the original three rows, it's [2,1,1], [9,1,4], [9,1,4]. Hmm. Wait, original input is:\n\nRow1: [9,1,4]\n\nRow2: [9,1,4]\n\nRow3: [2,1,1]\n\nThen the output adds three more rows: row3 again, row2 again, row1 again. But the output's lines 4,5,6 are [2,1,1], [9,1,4], [9,1,4]. Wait, that's row3, row2, row1. But in the original input, row1 and row2 are the same. So perhaps the pattern is that the output is the original input followed by a mirror. Like, append the reverse of the input rows.\n\nWait, example 0's input has three rows. The output has six rows: the original three, then the third row again, then the second, then the first. So the first three are original, the next three are the reverse order of the original rows. Because original order is row1, row2, row3. Then the next three are row3, row2, row1. So total rows are original + reversed order. But in the output, example0's output after the first three is [2,1,1], [9,1,4], [9,1,4]. Which is row3, row2, row1. So yes, original followed by reverse. So the pattern is to take the input rows and append their reverse.\n\nChecking example1:\n\nInput rows:\n\n[4,8,4]\n\n[7,6,7]\n\n[8,7,8]\n\nOutput is:\n\nOriginal three, then [8,7,8], [7,6,7], [4,8,4]. Which is reverse order of the input rows. So yes, original followed by reversed.\n\nExample2's input:\n\n[7,7,7]\n\n[9,5,5]\n\n[5,1,7]\n\nOutput:\n\nOriginal three, then [5,1,7], [9,5,5], [7,7,7]. Again reversed order. Same pattern.\n\nExample3's input:\n\n[2,6,9]\n\n[2,6,9]\n\n[2,9,2]\n\nOutput is original followed by [2,9,2], [2,6,9], [2,6,9]. Which is row3, row2, row1. So the pattern holds here too.\n\nSo the general pattern seems to be that the output is the original input rows followed by the reverse of those rows. So for a 3-row input, the output is the three original rows plus the three rows in reverse order (third row first, then second, then first).\n\nWait, but in example0's output, the reversed part is [2,1,1], [9,1,4], [9,1,4]. Which is row3, row2, row1. But the original input's rows are row1: [9,1,4], row2: [9,1,4], row3: [2,1,1]. So the reversed order would be row3, row2, row1, which is exactly what's added. So the output is original + reversed rows.\n\nSo the test input is:\n\n[2,9,2]\n\n[8,5,2]\n\n[2,2,8]\n\nSo the original three rows. Then we need to append the reversed list of rows. So reversed order would be the third row first, then the second, then the first.\n\nThird row is [2,2,8], second is [8,5,2], first is [2,9,2].\n\nSo the output would be the original three rows followed by [2,2,8], [8,5,2], [2,9,2].\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nOriginal:\n\n[2,9,2]\n\n[8,5,2]\n\n[2,2,8]\n\nThen reversed rows:\n\n[2,2,8], [8,5,2], [2,9,2]\n\nSo the full output would be:\n\n[2,9,2]\n\n[8,5,2]\n\n[2,2,8]\n\n[2,2,8]\n\n[8,5,2]\n\n[2,9,2]\n\nWhich matches the pattern observed in the training examples.",

        "cot_2": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. So, looking at the training examples, each input is a set of three arrays, and the output is six arrays. Let me see how they're related.\n\nStarting with Example 0. The input is three rows: [9,1,4], [9,1,4], [2,1,1]. The output has six rows. The first three are the same as the input. Then the next three are the third row repeated twice and then the first again? Wait, let me check:\n\nOriginal input rows:\n1. [9,1,4]\n2. [9,1,4]\n3. [2,1,1]\n\nOutput adds three more rows:\n4. [2,1,1] (same as row 3)\n5. [9,1,4] (same as row 1)\n6. [9,1,4] (same as row 2)\n\nWait, but rows 1 and 2 in the input are the same. So maybe the output is the original input followed by the reverse of the input? Let's check another example.\n\nExample 1's input is three rows:\n[4,8,4], [7,6,7], [8,7,8]\n\nOutput is these three, followed by [8,7,8], [7,6,7], [4,8,4]. So that's the original three rows, then reversed. So rows 3,2,1. Wait, the original is row1, row2, row3. Then the output adds row3, row2, row1. But in example 0, the original input's third row is [2,1,1], so the output adds that again, then row1 and row2. But in example0, rows1 and 2 are the same, so reversing them would look the same. Hmm.\n\nWait example0's output is the original three rows, then [2,1,1], [9,1,4], [9,1,4]. Which is row3, row1, row2? No, that doesn't fit. Wait, maybe the output is the input rows followed by a mirrored version. Let me check all examples.\n\nExample2's input:\n[7,7,7], [9,5,5], [5,1,7]\n\nOutput adds [5,1,7], [9,5,5], [7,7,7]. Which is row3, row2, row1. So for example2, the added rows are the input in reverse order.\n\nSimilarly, example3's input is three rows, and the output adds the third, second, first. So the pattern seems to be that the output is the original three rows followed by the same three rows in reverse order. Let's check:\n\nExample0: input rows are A, A, B. Output is A, A, B, B, A, A. Which is A, A, B followed by B, A, A. But reversing the three rows would be B, A, A. Which is exactly what's happening. So the total output is original three rows + reversed three rows.\n\nWait, original three rows as in the order of the input. Then the next three rows are the input rows in reverse order. So for example0, input is [A, A, B], reversed would be [B, A, A], so the output is A, A, B, B, A, A. Which matches the output.\n\nSimilarly, example1's input is [C, D, E], output is C, D, E, E, D, C. Which is the original followed by reversed. Wait, reversed would be E, D, C, but the output is E, D, C. So yes. So the pattern is append the reverse of the original three rows.\n\nBut let's confirm with example3. Input is [F, F, G]. Output is F, F, G, G, F, F. Which is the original followed by reversed, which is G, F, F. Wait, the reversed of [F, F, G] would be [G, F, F], but the output's added part is G, F, F. So yes.\n\nSo the general pattern is: take the three input rows, then append the same three rows in reverse order. So the output is the original input concatenated with the reversed list of input rows.\n\nNow let's test this against the test input. The test input is:\n\n[2,9,2]\n[8,5,2]\n[2,2,8]\n\nOriginal list is three rows. The output should be the original followed by the reversed list. So reversed list would be [2,2,8], [8,5,2], [2,9,2]. So the output is the original three rows plus these three reversed rows. So combining them:\n\nFirst three rows as is:\n[2,9,2]\n[8,5,2]\n[2,2,8]\n\nThen reversed order of the three rows:\n[2,2,8]\n[8,5,2]\n[2,9,2]\n\nWait wait, no. Wait, the reversed order of the list of three rows would be the third row first, then second, then first. So original input is row1, row2, row3. Reversed is row3, row2, row1. So for the test input:\n\nOriginal rows in order:\n\nRow1: [2,9,2]\n\nRow2: [8,5,2]\n\nRow3: [2,2,8]\n\nReversed order would be row3, row2, row1. So the reversed list is:\n\n[2,2,8], [8,5,2], [2,9,2]\n\nSo the full output would be the original three rows followed by these three reversed rows.\n\nSo combining them, the output is:\n\nRow1: [2,9,2]\n\nRow2: [8,5,2]\n\nRow3: [2,2,8]\n\nRow4: [2,2,8]\n\nRow5: [8,5,2]\n\nRow6: [2,9,2]\n\nWhich matches the expected pattern. So the answer should be the original three rows followed by the three reversed rows. Let's check the training examples again to confirm.\n\nIn example1, input is [4,8,4], [7,6,7], [8,7,8]. Output is those three, then [8,7,8], [7,6,7], [4,8,4]. Which is row3, row2, row1. So reversed order. So yes.\n\nTherefore, applying this to the test input, the output should be the original three rows followed by the reversed three rows. So the final answer is as per the structure."
