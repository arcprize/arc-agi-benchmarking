        "cot_1": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. I have these training examples where the input is a list of lists (like a matrix) and the output is another list of lists. Let's look at each example to see what's going on.\n\nStarting with Example 0:\n\nInput:\n[2, 1, 2, 1, 2]\n[1, 1, 1, 1, 1]\n[2, 1, 2, 1, 2]\n[0, 0, 1, 1, 1]\n[0, 0, 2, 1, 2]\n\nOutput:\n[1, 1]\n[2, 1]\n\nLooking at the input matrix, maybe the output is derived from certain rows. The output has two rows. Let's check which rows in the input correspond. The output rows [1,1] and [2,1] might be from the first and third rows? Wait, the first input row is [2,1,2,1,2], but the first output row is [1,1]. Maybe not directly. Alternatively, perhaps the output is taking the last two elements of certain rows.\n\nLooking at the input rows, let's check their last two elements. The first row ends with 1,2. The second row ends with 1,1. The third row ends with 1,2. The fourth row ends with 1,1. The fifth row ends with 1,2. The output is [1,1] and [2,1]. Wait, that doesn't match. Hmm. Maybe the pattern is about rows that are duplicated. For instance, in the input, the first, third, and fifth rows start with 2 and have a pattern. The second row is all 1s. The fourth row starts with 0s. The output has two rows. Let's see if the output rows are rows from the input that are followed by a row with 0s. For example, the second row in the input is followed by the third, which isn't a 0 row. The fourth row starts with 0s. Wait, the output might be the rows that are immediately before the rows starting with 0. So in the input, the third row [2,1,2,1,2] is followed by the fourth row [0,0,...], so maybe the third row contributes to the output. Then the fourth row is followed by the fifth, which also starts with 0s. So the fifth row might not be considered. The output has two rows: [1,1] and [2,1]. Wait, the second row is [1,1,1,1,1], which is followed by the third row. But that third row isn't a 0 row. Hmm. Maybe this approach is wrong.\n\nAlternatively, maybe looking for the minimal value in the rows? Not sure. Let's look at example 1.\n\nExample 1 input:\n[8,6,0,6]\n[6,8,6,8]\n[8,6,8,6]\n[6,8,6,8]\n\nOutput: [8]\n\nThe output here is a single row. The input has four rows. The output row [8] could be related to the first element of each row. The first element of the first row is 8, then 6, 8, 6. The output is [8]. Maybe it's taking the maximum first element? But why only one row? Or perhaps the rows that start with 8 and end with 6? The first row starts with 8 and ends with 6. The third row starts with 8 and ends with 6. But the output is [8], which is a single element. Wait, maybe it's the first element of the rows that have certain properties. Wait, perhaps the output rows are the first elements of the rows that have the maximum occurrence. Let's see: in the input for example 1, the first elements are 8,6,8,6. So 8 appears twice and 6 appears twice. Hmm, but the output is [8]. Maybe the maximum first element? 8 is higher than 6, so maybe take the rows where the first element is the maximum. But the first and third rows start with 8. Then why is the output a single [8]? Unless they're combining those. Alternatively, maybe the output is the unique first elements of the rows that have the maximum length of their value. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is taking the first elements of the rows where the entire row follows a certain pattern. For example, in example 1, the first row is [8,6,0,6]. The third row is [8,6,8,6]. The output is [8]. Maybe the output is the first element of the row that has a certain sum or some other property. For instance, the first row sum is 8+6+0+6=20. Third row sum is 8+6+8+6=28. Not sure. Alternatively, maybe the output is the first elements of the rows where the row is a palindrome? The first row is 8,6,0,6 \u2013 not a palindrome. Third row is 8,6,8,6 \u2013 yes, that's a palindrome. But output is [8]. So maybe the first element of each palindromic row. The third row is a palindrome, so output is [8]. The fourth row is [6,8,6,8], which is a palindrome starting with 6, but output is [8]. So maybe only the first palindromic row with maximum first element?\n\nThis is getting complicated. Let's look at example 2.\n\nExample 2 input:\nMultiple rows. The output is [5,5] and [5,2]. Let's see the input rows. The first two rows are [2,2,5,2,2,5,2]. Then there's a row of all 5s. Then again the same pattern. The fifth row is [5,5,5,5,5,0,0], sixth is [2,2,5,2,2,0,0], and seventh is [2,2,5,2,2,5,2]. The output is [5,5] and [5,2].\n\nLooking at the output rows: [5,5] and [5,2]. These could be the last two elements of certain rows. For example, the fifth row ends with 0,0, but the output isn't that. The third row is all 5s, ends with 5,5. Maybe the third row's last two elements are 5,5, which is the first output row. Then, the seventh row ends with 5,2. Wait, the seventh input row is [2,2,5,2,2,5,2], so last two elements are 5,2. That matches the second output row. So maybe the output is taking the last two elements of rows that meet a certain condition. What condition? Let's check which rows in example 2 contribute to the output. The third row is all 5s, and fifth row ends with 0,0. But the output is [5,5] from third row, and [5,2] from the seventh row. Wait, the seventh row is the same as the first and second rows. But why would the output take the seventh row's last two elements? Alternatively, maybe the rows that are followed by a row with 0s. The fifth row ends with 0,0, so the row after that is the sixth, which also has 0s. Maybe the pattern is to take the last two elements of the row before the first occurrence of 0s. But in example 0, the fourth row starts with 0s. The row before that is the third row, which ends with 1,2. The output for example 0 is [1,1] and [2,1]. Hmm, that doesn't match. Let me think again.\n\nAnother approach: look at all outputs and their corresponding inputs. For each example, the output rows are parts of the input rows, possibly the first or last elements. Let's see:\n\nExample 0 output: [1,1] and [2,1]. Looking at input rows, the second row is [1,1,1,1,1], which starts with 1,1. The third row ends with 2,1. Wait, but the output is [2,1], which could be the last two elements of the third row. The second row's last two elements are 1,1. So output rows are last two elements of the second and third rows? But why those rows?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output consists of the rows that have a certain number of elements. For example, each output row is two elements, perhaps the middle elements of the input rows. But the input rows in example 0 have 5 elements, so the middle would be the third element. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is the two elements before the first occurrence of 0 in the row. For example, in example 0, the fourth row starts with 0,0. The row before (third row) is [2,1,2,1,2], but where would the 0s come in? Maybe the output is the elements before the first 0 in each column. Not sure.\n\nWait, let's look for a pattern in the output rows. For example 0, the output rows are [1,1] and [2,1]. Looking at the input matrix, perhaps these are the first two elements of the rows that are followed by a row starting with 0. The third row is followed by a row starting with 0, so maybe take the third row's first two elements? The third row starts with 2,1. But the output's second row is [2,1], so maybe that's it. Then the first output row is [1,1], which would be the second row's first two elements. The second row is followed by the third row, which doesn't start with 0. Hmm, that might not fit.\n\nAnother angle: maybe the output is formed by taking elements from rows where all elements to the right are 0. Wait, in example 2's fifth row, the last two elements are 0. The output for example 2 is [5,5] (third row's last two) and [5,2] (seventh row's last two). The fifth row's last two are 0,0, but output is [5,5] and [5,2]. So maybe rows that are followed by a row with 0s. The third row is followed by the fourth row, which is [2,2,5,2,2,5,2], no 0s. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output rows are the last two elements of the rows that are palindromic. Let's check. In example 1, the third row is [8,6,8,6], which is a palindrome? No, because it's 8,6,8,6. The fourth row is 6,8,6,8, which is a palindrome? No. The first row is 8,6,0,6 \u2013 not a palindrome. So example 1's output is [8], which is the first element of the first row. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the first element of each row that is a peak in its column. For example, in example 0's first column: 2,1,2,0,0. The peaks here are 2 (row 0) and 2 (row 2). So for the first column, peak elements are 2 and 2. But the output for example 0 is [1,1] and [2,1]. Not sure.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps the output rows are formed by taking the elements that are surrounded by the same numbers. For example, in example 0's input, looking at each cell's neighbors. But this might be complicated.\n\nWait, perhaps the output is formed by taking the elements from the rows that are not followed by a row starting with the same number. Let's check example 0:\n\nRow 0: starts with 2. Next row (row1) starts with 1. Different, so maybe include row0's something. But output for example0 is [1,1] and [2,1]. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the two elements after the first occurrence of a certain number. For example, in example0's first row, after the first 2, the next two elements are 1 and 2. But that's not matching the output.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the test input:\n\nTest Input:\n[8, 1, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0]\n[1, 8, 8, 1, 0, 0, 0]\n[8, 8, 1, 8, 0, 0, 0]\n[8, 1, 8, 8, 1, 8, 8]\n[1, 8, 8, 1, 8, 8, 1]\n[8, 8, 1, 8, 8, 1, 8]\n[8, 1, 8, 8, 1, 8, 8]\n\nLooking at the last three elements of each row, which are 0s in the first three rows. The fourth row ends with 1,8,8. Fifth row ends with 8,1. Sixth row ends with 1,8. Seventh row ends with 8,8.\n\nIf the pattern from example 2 is taking the last two elements of certain rows, maybe the test output would involve the last two elements of some rows. But what rows?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the last two elements of the rows that have the maximum value in their first element. For example, in the test input, the first row starts with 8, then 1, 8, etc. The rows starting with 8 are rows 0, 2, 3, 5, 6. The max first element is 8. So the output would be the last two elements of those rows. For example, row0 ends with 0,0,0, so last two are 0,0. Row2 ends with 0,0,0. Row3 ends with 8,8. Row5 ends with 1,8. Row6 ends with 8,8. But the output from the examples isn't combining all of them. In example1, only one row was output. So maybe the output is the unique last two elements of the rows with the maximum first element, but sorted or in order of appearance.\n\nWait, in example1, the output is [8]. The rows with first element 8 are row0 and row2. Their last two elements are 0,6 (row0) and 8,6 (row2). But the output is [8], which is the first element of those rows. So maybe it's the first element of the rows that start with the maximum first element. In example1, max first element is 8, so take the first element (8) from those rows, but output is just [8], perhaps because they are all the same. Similarly, in example0, the rows starting with 2 are row0, row2, row4. Their first elements are 2. But the output in example0 is [1,1] and [2,1], which don't relate directly to 2. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, the output could be the first elements of the rows that have the maximum first element. But in example0, the maximum first element is 2. The first elements of those rows would be 2,2,2. But output is different.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is the first element of the row that has the maximum sum. For example, in example1, let's calculate the sum of each row. Row0: 8+6+0+6=20. Row1:6+8+6+8=28. Row2:8+6+8+6=28. Row3:6+8+6+8=28. So rows1-3 have sum 28. The first element of those rows are 6,8,6. The output is [8], which is the first element of row2, which has sum 28. So perhaps among the rows with maximum sum, take the first element. But why row2 and not row1 or row3? Because row2 starts with 8, which is higher than 6. So maybe among the rows with maximum sum, pick the one with the highest first element, and take its first element. In example1, rows1,2,3 have sum 28. Among these, row2 and row3 start with 8 and 6. So row2 has the highest first element, so output [8]. This fits example1's output.\n\nIf that's the case, then example0: let's check the sums.\n\nExample0 rows:\n\nRow0:2+1+2+1+2=8\n\nRow1:1*5=5\n\nRow2: same as row0, sum 8.\n\nRow3:0+0+1+1+1=3\n\nRow4:0+0+2+1+2=5\n\nSo the maximum sum is 8 in rows0 and 2. Their first elements are 2 and 2. So according to this logic, the output would be the first elements of those rows, but the actual output in example0 is [1,1] and [2,1]. So this doesn't fit. So maybe the sum approach isn't right.\n\nLet's think differently. Maybe the output is the two elements that are in the same position across multiple rows. For example, in example0's output [1,1] and [2,1], these could be columns where the majority of elements are 1 and 2. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the elements that form a path through the matrix. For example, moving down and right, or some direction. But without clear examples, it's hard to tell.\n\nAnother approach: look for the outputs in the training examples and see if they're parts of the input rows.\n\nExample0's output is [1,1] and [2,1]. The input's second row is [1,1,1,1,1], which has 1s. The third row ends with 1,2. Wait, [2,1] could be the fourth and fifth elements of the third row (which are 1,2)? No, that's 1,2. The output is [2,1]. Maybe it's reversed. Or perhaps from another row.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is made up of the elements from rows that are the same as other rows. For example, in example0, the first and third rows are the same. The output's second row is [2,1], which could be the first two elements of the first row (2,1). But the first row starts with 2,1. So [2,1] would be the first two elements. But the output's second row is [2,1], which matches. Then why is the first output row [1,1]? That's the first two elements of the second row, which is [1,1,1,1,1]. So the output could be the first two elements of rows that are duplicates. The first and third rows are duplicates (both [2,1,2,1,2]), so their first two elements are 2,1. But the output includes [2,1] as the second row. The second row is unique (all 1s), so its first two elements are 1,1. But why are these in the output? In example0's output, it's two rows: [1,1] and [2,1]. So perhaps the output is the first two elements of each unique row type. The input has three unique rows: [2,1,2,1,2], [1,1,1,1,1], and [0,0,..]. The output includes [1,1] and [2,1], which are the first two elements of the first and second unique rows. But the third unique row (starting with 0s) is not in the output. So maybe the output includes the first two elements of all rows except those starting with 0. But example0's output has two rows, which matches the first two unique rows.\n\nBut example1's input has four rows. The first row is [8,6,0,6], second is [6,8,6,8], third is [8,6,8,6], fourth is [6,8,6,8]. The unique rows are the first and second (since third is [8,6,8,6], which is different from others). Wait, no:\n\nRow0:8,6,0,6\n\nRow1:6,8,6,8\n\nRow2:8,6,8,6\n\nRow3:6,8,6,8\n\nSo rows 1 and 3 are the same. Rows 0 and 2 are different. So unique rows are four? No. Row0 is unique, row1 and row3 are same, row2 is unique. So three unique rows. But the output is [8]. Which doesn't fit this pattern.\n\nHmm. Maybe this approach isn't correct.\n\nAlternatively, think about the output rows as being the two most common first elements. For example, in example0's input, the first elements are 2,1,2,0,0. So 2 appears three times, 1 once, 0 twice. The most common is 2. But the output includes 1 and 2. Not sure.\n\nAnother thought: the output rows are the elements that are in the same position as the first occurrence of a number in each column. For example, in example0's input:\n\nColumns:\n\nColumn0: [2,1,2,0,0] \u2192 first occurrence is 2.\n\nColumn1: [1,1,1,0,0] \u2192 first is 1.\n\nSo the first elements of the columns are 2,1,2,0,0. But the output is [1,1] and [2,1]. Not matching.\n\nAlternatively, the output is the minimum and maximum of certain columns. For example, example0's output rows [1,1] and [2,1] could be the min and max of some columns. Not sure.\n\nLet's try another approach. The output in example0 has two rows, each with two elements. The input rows have five elements. Maybe the output is formed by taking two elements from each of two rows. For example, the first two elements of row1 and the last two elements of row2. But in example0's output, [1,1] and [2,1], the first could be from row1's first two elements (1,1), and the second from row3's first two elements (0,0) which is not the case. So maybe not.\n\nWait, in example0's output, the first row is [1,1], which is exactly the first two elements of the second input row. The second output row is [2,1], which are the first two elements of the third input row. Then, the output rows are the first two elements of the second and third input rows. But why those rows? What's special about them?\n\nThe second input row is all 1s. The third input row is the same as the first and fifth. But why are these selected? Maybe the rows that are surrounded by other rows with certain properties.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output rows are the first two elements of each row that is followed by a row with a certain pattern. For example, in example0, the second row is followed by the third row (same as first), and the third row is followed by the fourth (starting with 0s). But I don't see a connection.\n\nIn example1, the output is [8], which is the first element of the first row. But why that row? The first row's first element is 8, which is the maximum in the column. But in example1's first column, the elements are 8,6,8,6. So the maximum is 8, appearing in rows 0 and 2. But the output is [8], perhaps taking the first occurrence of the maximum first element.\n\nIf that's the case, then in example0's first column, the maximum is 2 (rows 0,2,4). The first occurrence is row0. So output would include [2,1] (first two elements). But example0's output includes [1,1] and [2,1], which doesn't match.\n\nAnother angle: perhaps the output is made up of the elements that are at the positions where the number changes in each row. For example, in a row like [2,1,2,1,2], the changes happen between each element. But how would that translate to the output?\n\nAlternatively, considering the examples' outputs:\n\nExample0's output has two rows. The first row is [1,1], which could correspond to the second input row (all 1s), taking the first two elements. The second output row is [2,1], which are the first two elements of the third input row. But why these two rows?\n\nLooking at the rows in example0:\n\nRow0: [2,1,2,1,2]\n\nRow1: [1,1,1,1,1]\n\nRow2: [2,1,2,1,2]\n\nRow3: [0,0,1,1,1]\n\nRow4: [0,0,2,1,2]\n\nThe output is [1,1] and [2,1]. These are the first two elements of row1 and row2. So perhaps the output is the first two elements of rows that are followed by a row with a lower first element. Row1 is followed by row2, whose first element is 2, which is higher than 1. So that doesn't fit. Row2 is followed by row3, first element 0, which is lower than 2. So maybe row2 is included because its next row starts with a lower number. So output includes row2's first two elements [2,1]. Similarly, row3 is followed by row4, which starts with 0 (same as row3), so not lower. Row4 is last row, so no next row. So maybe row2 is included. But why row1? Row1 is followed by row2 with first element 2, which is higher. But output includes row1's first two elements. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAnother possibility: the output rows are the first two elements of each row that is a local minimum or maximum in terms of the first element. For example, in example0's first elements: 2,1,2,0,0. The local minima are 1 (row1) and 0 (row3 and 4). The local maxima are 2 (row0,2). So perhaps the output includes these first two elements. But example0's output has [1,1] (row1's first two elements) and [2,1] (row2's first two). Row2's first element is 2, which is a local maximum (since previous row is 1 and next is 0). So row1 is a local minimum, and row2 is a local maximum. So output includes both. This fits example0's output.\n\nTesting this hypothesis with example1:\n\nFirst elements are 8,6,8,6. Local maxima are 8 (row0 and 2), local minima are 6 (row1 and 3). So the output would include the first two elements of row0 and row2. But the output is [8]. How does this fit? Maybe only the first occurrence of the maximum first element. The first row with first element 8 is row0, so output is [8,6], but example1's output is [8]. Hmm, doesn't fit.\n\nBut example1's output is a single element [8]. Maybe the output is the first element of each local maximum. In example0, the local maxima are row0 and row2 (first elements 2), so their first elements are 2. But the output includes [1,1] and [2,1]. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternative approach: Maybe the output is formed by taking the first occurrence of a number in each row and then some pattern. For example, in example0's output, [1,1] and [2,1]. Maybe the first occurrence of 1 and 2 in each row. Not sure.\n\nLet's think again. In example0's output, the two rows are [1,1] and [2,1]. Looking at the input matrix, perhaps these are the first two elements of the rows that are immediately before a row with a lower first element. \n\nRow0 is followed by row1 (first element 1, which is lower than 2), so row0's first two elements would be [2,1]. But example0's output's second row is [2,1]. Then row1 is followed by row2 (first element 2, which is higher), so not included. Row2 is followed by row3 (0, which is lower), so row2's first two elements [2,1] are included. So output would have [2,1] from row0 and [2,1] from row2. But example0's output has [1,1] and [2,1], which doesn't match. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the first two elements of the rows that are followed by a row with a different first element. For example, row0 is followed by row1 (different first element), so include row0's first two. Row1 is followed by row2 (different), include row1's first two. Row2 followed by row3 (different), include row2's. Row3 followed by row4 (same), so not included. So output would be [2,1], [1,1], [2,1]. But example0's output is two rows. So maybe only include the first two such rows. But example0's output is [1,1] and [2,1], which doesn't match.\n\nThis is really challenging. Let's look at example2's output [5,5] and [5,2]. The input has rows with varying elements. The third row is all 5s, which would give last two elements 5,5. The seventh row ends with 5,2. So perhaps these rows are selected because they are the only ones with those endings.\n\nBut why those particular rows? The third row is all 5s, so perhaps it's the only such row, and the seventh row is a duplicate of the first two but with different endings. Or maybe the third row is followed by a row with a different first element. For example, the third row is followed by the fourth row, which starts with 2. The seventh row is the last row, so no next row.\n\nAlternatively, the third row is the first row where all elements are 5, so maybe that's why its last two elements are included. The seventh row ends with 5,2, which could be unique.\n\nBut why in example2's output those two rows? Maybe the output rows are the last two elements of the rows that are followed by a row with a different first element. The third row's first element is 5, next row is 2. So yes. The seventh row is last, so no next row, but maybe included because it's the last. But example2's output has two rows. This approach may not fit.\n\nLet's try to think of another pattern. Maybe the output is the elements that are in the same position as the majority element in each column. For example, in example0's input:\n\nColumns:\n\nColumn0: [2,1,2,0,0] \u2192 majority is 0 or 2? Let's count:\n\n2 appears three times, 1 once, 0 twice. So majority is 2. So output column0 would be 2.\n\nColumn1: [1,1,1,0,0] \u2192 majority is 1 (three times). So output column1 would be 1.\n\nBut the output is two rows of two elements each, which doesn't fit.\n\nAlternative idea: perhaps the output is the elements that are the same in all rows. For example, in example1's input:\n\nAll rows are length 4. What elements are the same in all rows? Looking at each position:\n\nPosition0: 8,6,8,6 \u2192 not all same.\n\nPosition1:6,8,6,8 \u2192 not same.\n\nPosition2:0,6,8,6 \u2192 no.\n\nPosition3:6,8,6,8 \u2192 no.\n\nSo no element is the same in all rows, but output is [8], which doesn't fit.\n\nIn example0, no element is the same in all rows. So this can't be.\n\nAnother approach: looking for the output to be the central elements of the input matrix. For example, example0's matrix is 5x5. The center is at row2, column2 (element 2). But output is two rows of two elements. Not matching.\n\nAlternatively, the output is the elements in positions where the row and column indices are even or odd. Not sure.\n\nWait, example0's output has two rows. Maybe each output row corresponds to a pair of input rows. For example, the first output row is from the first two input rows. The second output row is from the next two. But example0's output rows are [1,1] and [2,1], which would correspond to row1 and row2. How?\n\nAlternatively, the output is the result of some mathematical operation between consecutive rows. For example, subtracting adjacent rows. Let's try example0:\n\nRow1 minus row0: [1-2, 1-1, 1-2, 1-1, 1-2] = [-1, 0, -1, 0, -1]. Not relevant to the output.\n\nAlternatively, comparing adjacent elements in a row. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, the output is the two elements that are repeated most consecutively in each row. For example, in example0's row1, all elements are 1, so the longest consecutive is all, but output is [1,1]. In row3, the first two elements are 0,0. The output for example0 includes [1,1] and [2,1], which are the first two elements of row1 and row2. So maybe the output rows are the first two elements of each row where the first two elements are the same. But row1's first two are 1,1. Row3's first two are 0,0. So why is the output [1,1] and [2,1]? Row2's first two are 2,1, which are not the same. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAnother idea: the output rows are the first two elements of the rows that have the maximum number of a particular element. For example, in example0's row1 has five 1s. So it's selected. The row0 and row2 have three 2s. So the first two elements of row1 (1,1) are output. Then, what about the other output row [2,1]? Maybe from row2 which has the most 2s. But how to determine that.\n\nAlternatively, the output rows are the first two elements of the rows that have the maximum count of their first element. For example, in example0, the first element 2 appears three times (rows0,2,4). So the rows with first element 2 would contribute their first two elements. But example0's output includes [2,1] as the second row, which is from row2. But why not include row0 and row4 as well? Maybe only the first and last such rows. But example0's output has only two rows, so perhaps the first and middle rows.\n\nAlternatively, the output rows are the first two elements of the first and last rows that have the maximum first element. But in example0, the first and last rows with first element 2 are row0 and row4. Their first two elements are [2,1] and [0,0]. Not matching the output.\n\nThis is really challenging. Let's try to summarize what's common in the training examples' outputs.\n\nIn each training example, the output consists of 1 or 2 rows. Each row in the output is a pair of numbers. These pairs are derived from certain rows in the input.\n\nLooking at example0's output:\n\n[1,1] and [2,1]. These are the first two elements of the second and third input rows.\n\nExample1's output: [8], which is the first element of the first input row.\n\nExample2's output: [5,5] and [5,2]. These are the third and seventh input rows' last two elements.\n\nSo the pattern might be that the output is composed of the first or last two elements of certain rows. The criteria for selecting these rows could vary.\n\nIn example0, the selected rows are the second and third. In example1, the first row. In example2, the third and seventh rows.\n\nWhat's special about these rows?\n\nIn example2, the third row is all 5s. The seventh row is a copy of the first and second rows but ends with 5,2.\n\nAlternatively, the output rows are the ones that have a certain number of occurrences of a particular element. For example, in example2, the third row has all 5s, which is unique, and the seventh row is part of the pattern but modified at the end.\n\nAlternatively, looking for rows that are unique in some way. For example, in example0, the second row is all 1s, which is unique. The third row is part of a repeating pattern but is followed by a row with 0s.\n\nBut I'm not seeing a clear pattern here.\n\nAnother approach: the output rows are the elements from the input matrix where the value changes from the previous element in the same row. For example, in example0's second row [1,1,1,1,1], there are no changes. So perhaps no elements are taken. But the output includes [1,1], which is from this row. So that's not it.\n\nAlternatively, the output is formed by looking for pairs of elements that are the same in consecutive positions. In example0's row1, all elements are 1, so every pair is [1,1]. The output includes [1,1]. In row2, the first two elements are 2 and 1, which are different. The third row starts with 0,0, which is a pair. But example0's output doesn't include [0,0]. So maybe only pairs that are not followed by another pair. Not sure.\n\nIn example2's third row, all elements are 5, so any consecutive pair is [5,5]. The output includes [5,5]. The seventh row ends with 5,2. So the pair there is [5,2]. So maybe the output is pairs that are unique in the matrix. But example0's [1,1] is unique to row1, and [2,1] is in row0 and row2. But example0's output has [2,1] once.\n\nThis is really tough. Let's think about the test input and see if any patterns emerge there.\n\nTest Input:\n7 rows. Each row has seven elements.\n\nLooking for possible output. The rows are:\n\nRow0: [8,1,8,8,0,0,0]\n\nRow1: [1,8,8,1,0,0,0]\n\nRow2: [8,8,1,8,0,0,0]\n\nRow3: [8,1,8,8,1,8,8]\n\nRow4: [1,8,8,1,8,8,1]\n\nRow5: [8,8,1,8,8,1,8]\n\nRow6: [8,1,8,8,1,8,8]\n\nPossible outputs could be based on rows that have certain characteristics.\n\nIf the pattern from example2 is to take the last two elements of rows that have a certain property, maybe the test input's rows 0,1,2 end with 0s. Rows3-6 end with 8,1,8, etc.\n\nFor example, if the output is the last two elements of the rows that are followed by a row with 0s, then in test input, rows0-2 are followed by rows that do not have 0s (except row3). So not sure.\n\nAlternatively, if the output is the last two elements of rows that are followed by a row with a different first element. For example, row0 is followed by row1 (first element 1), which is different. So row0's last two elements are 0,0. Row1 is followed by row2 (first element 8). So different. Row2 is followed by row3 (8), same. So row2 is not included. Row3 is followed by row4 (1), different. Row4 is followed by row5 (8), different. Row5 is followed by row6 (8), same. Row6 is last. So the rows followed by different first elements are row0, row1, row3, row4. Their last two elements would be:\n\nRow0: 0,0\n\nRow1: 0,0\n\nRow3:8,8\n\nRow4:8,1\n\nSo output might include [0,0], [0,0], [8,8], [8,1]. But the training examples' outputs don't have duplicate entries. So maybe only unique pairs. So [0,0], [8,8], [8,1]. But example0's output has two rows, example2's output has two rows. So maybe the test output would have two rows. But how?\n\nAlternatively, if the pattern is to take the first two elements of rows that are followed by a row with a different first element. Then:\n\nRow0 is followed by row1 (1 vs 8) \u2192 different. First two elements: 8,1.\n\nRow1 followed by row2 (8 vs 1) \u2192 different. First two:1,8.\n\nRow3 followed by row4 (1 vs 8) \u2192 different. First two:8,1.\n\nRow4 followed by row5 (8 vs 1) \u2192 different. First two:1,8.\n\nRow5 followed by row6 (8 vs 8) \u2192 same. Not included.\n\nSo these first two elements are:\n\nRow0:8,1\n\nRow1:1,8\n\nRow3:8,1\n\nRow4:1,8\n\nSo unique pairs are [8,1], [1,8]. But how many times they appear. If the output is these unique pairs, then the test output would be:\n\n[8,1]\n\n[1,8]\n\nBut looking at the training examples:\n\nExample0's output is [1,1] and [2,1]. These are two different pairs. Example1's output is [8]. Not sure how this fits.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the first two elements of the first and last rows that are followed by a row with a different first element. In the test input, the first such row is row0 ([8,1,8,8,0,0,0]), followed by row1 (first element 1). So first two elements 8,1. The last such row is row4, followed by row5 (first element 8). So first two elements 1,8. So output would be [8,1] and [1,8]. But the training examples don't show this pattern.\n\nAlternatively, considering the test input's rows3-6, which start with 8,1,8,8. Their last two elements are:\n\nRow3:8,8\n\nRow4:8,1\n\nRow5:1,8\n\nRow6:8,8\n\nIf the pattern is to take the last two elements of the rows that start with 8, then the output would be [0,0] (row0), [0,0] (row2), [8,8] (row3), [8,1] (row5), [8,8] (row6). But unique pairs would be [0,0], [8,8], [8,1]. But again, how does this fit with the training examples?\n\nLooking back at the training examples, example1's output is [8], which is the first element of the first row. But according to the current hypothesis, the output would be the first two elements of certain rows. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAnother possible pattern: the output consists of the first two elements of the rows that have the maximum number of occurrences of a particular element. For example, in example1, the first row has 8 once, and other elements. Maybe the output is the first element of the row with the maximum number of a particular element. But in example1, the first row has 8 once, third row has 8 twice. So third row has more 8s. But output is [8], which is the first element of the first row. So this doesn't fit.\n\nI'm really stuck. Maybe I should look for a different approach. Perhaps the output is the first two elements of the rows that are duplicates. For example, in example0, the first, third, and fifth rows are duplicates. The output's second row is [2,1], which is their first two elements. The second row is unique, so its first two elements [1,1] are included. But why only two rows in the output?\n\nIn example1, the second and fourth rows are duplicates. Their first two elements are [6,8]. The first and third rows are not duplicates. So output would be [6,8]. But the output is [8], so this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, the output is the first two elements of the rows that have the maximum number of duplicates. In example0, rows0,2,4 are duplicates, so their first two elements are [2,1]. The output includes [2,1] once. The second row is unique, so [1,1] is included. But why two rows in the output?\n\nMaybe the output is the first two elements of each unique row type. Example0 has three unique row types (as discussed earlier), but output includes two. Maybe only the first two unique rows. The first unique row is [2,1,2,1,2] (rows0,2,4), second unique row is [1,1,1,1,1] (row1), third is [0,0, ...]. So output includes first two unique rows' first two elements: [2,1] and [1,1]. But example0's output is [1,1] and [2,1]. So maybe sorted in the order they first appear. The first unique row's first two elements are [2,1], but example0's output starts with [1,1]. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAt this point, I'm struggling to find a clear pattern. Given the time I've spent and the need to provide an answer, I'll make an educated guess based on some observations.\n\nIn example2's input, the third row is all 5s except the last two elements. The output's first row is [5,5], which are the last two elements of the third row. The seventh row ends with 0,0, but the output's second row is [5,2], which are the fifth and sixth elements of the seventh row (since the seventh row is [2,2,5,2,2,0,0], but wait, no. The seventh row in example2 is [2,2,5,2,2,0,0]. So last two elements are 0,0. But the output is [5,5] and [5,2]. Hmm, I'm confused now. Maybe I made a mistake.\n\nWait, example2's input has seven rows. The seventh row is [2,2,5,2,2,0,0]. So the last two elements are 0,0. But the output is [5,5] and [5,2]. So where do these come from?\n\nThe third row is [5,5,5,5,5,5,5], so last two are 5,5. The fifth row is [5,5,5,5,5,0,0], so last two are 0,0. The sixth row is [2,2,5,2,2,0,0], last two 0,0. The seventh row is [2,2,5,2,2,5,2], last two 5,2. Oh wait, maybe I read the rows wrong. Let me check example2's input again.\n\nExample2's input:\n\nRow0: [2,2,5,2,2,5,2]\n\nRow1: [2,2,5,2,2,5,2]\n\nRow2: [5,5,5,5,5,5,5]\n\nRow3: [2,2,5,2,2,5,2]\n\nRow4: [2,2,5,2,2,5,2]\n\nRow5: [5,5,5,5,5,0,0]\n\nRow6: [2,2,5,2,2,0,0]\n\nRow7: [2,2,5,2,2,5,2]\n\nWait, no. The input is written as:\n\n[2, 2, 5, 2, 2, 5, 2]\n[2, 2, 5, 2, 2, 5, 2]\n[5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5]\n[2, 2, 5, 2, 2, 5, 2]\n[2, 2, 5, 2, 2, 5, 2]\n[5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0]\n[2, 2, 5, 2, 2, 0, 0]\n\nSo the rows are 0 to 6. The output is [5,5] and [5,2]. \n\nLooking at row2 (all 5s), last two elements are 5,5 \u2192 which is the first output row. The last row (row6) is [2,2,5,2,2,0,0], last two are 0,0. But the output is [5,2]. Maybe I made a mistake. Let me recheck.\n\nThe output for example2 is [5,5] and [5,2]. Where do these come from?\n\nLooking at row2's last two elements: 5,5 \u2192 [5,5].\n\nRow5's last two elements:0,0.\n\nRow6's last two:0,0.\n\nThe other rows end with 5,2 or 2, but not matching the output. So perhaps the fifth row is [5,5,5,5,5,0,0], so the fifth element is 5, followed by 0,0. The fifth element here is 5 (index4), and the sixth is 0 (index5). But the output is [5,5] and [5,2]. Where is the [5,2] coming from?\n\nLooking at row0: ends with 5,2. So last two elements are 5,2. But why would row0's last two be selected? Because example2's output is [5,5] and [5,2], which are the last two elements of row2 and row0. But why those rows? Maybe rows that are followed by a row with a different first element. Row0 is followed by row1 (same first element), so not included. Row2 is followed by row3 (first element 2, different from 5). So row2 is included. Its last two elements are 5,5. Row3 is followed by row4 (same first element 2), not included. Row5 is followed by row6 (first element 2, different from 5). So row5's last two elements are 0,0. But the output's second row is [5,2], which comes from row0. So maybe this isn't the pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output consists of the last two elements of the first row that has a certain property and another row. For example, the first row that has all elements 5 (row2) and the first row that ends with 5,2 (row0). But example2's output includes [5,5] and [5,2]. But why these rows?\n\nGiven the time I've spent and the need to provide an answer, I'll proceed with the following hypothesis:\n\nThe output consists of the last two elements of the rows that have the maximum value in their first column. If the maximum first element appears in multiple rows, their last two elements are included in the output.\n\nLet's test this hypothesis:\n\nExample0's first column elements are 2,1,2,0,0. The maximum is 2, appearing in rows0,2,4. Their last two elements are 1,2 (row0), 1,2 (row2), and 1,2 (row4). But example0's output is [1,1] and [2,1]. Doesn't fit.\n\nExample1's first column elements are 8,6,8,6. Max is 8, appearing in rows0 and 2. Their last two elements are 0,6 (row0) and 8,6 (row2). The output is [8]. Doesn't fit.\n\nExample2's first column elements are 2,2,5,2,2,5,2. Max is 5, appearing in row2 and row5. Their last two elements are 5,5 (row2) and 0,0 (row5). The output is [5,5] and [5,2]. Row5's last two are 0,0, which doesn't match. So this hypothesis is invalid.\n\nFinal attempt: The output rows are the last two elements of the rows that are palindromes.\n\nExample0's rows: none are palindromes. But output is present.\n\nExample1's rows:\n\nRow0:8,6,0,6 \u2192 not palindrome.\n\nRow1:6,8,6,8 \u2192 palindrome.\n\nRow2:8,6,8,6 \u2192 palindrome.\n\nRow3:6,8,6,8 \u2192 palindrome.\n\nThe output is [8], which doesn't match.\n\nExample2's rows:\n\nRow2 is all 5s, which is a palindrome. Row0 is [2,2,5,2,2,5,2] \u2192 not a palindrome. The output is [5,5] and [5,2]. Only row2 is a palindrome. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAt this point, I'm out of ideas. Given the time constraints, I'll make a guess based on example patterns and apply it to the test input.\n\nLooking at the test input:\n\nRows0-2 end with 0s. Rows3-6 have varying endings. If the pattern is to take the last two elements of the rows that have the maximum first element (8), then:\n\nRows0,2,3,5,6 start with 8. Their last two elements are:\n\nRow0:0,0\n\nRow2:0,0\n\nRow3:8,8\n\nRow5:1,8\n\nRow6:8,8\n\nSo unique pairs are [0,0], [8,8], [1,8]. But example0 and example2 have two output rows. Maybe take the first two of these. So [0,0] and [8,8]. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, if the output is the first two such rows, but in the test input, the first two rows starting with 8 are rows0 and2, both ending with 0,0. So output would be [0,0] and [0,0], but example1's output doesn't repeat.\n\nAlternatively, if the output is the first and last such rows. Row0 and row6. Their last two elements are 0,0 and 8,8. But example0's output isn't like that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is the last two elements of the rows that have the maximum first element and are followed by a row that doesn't start with the same. For example, row0 is followed by row1 (starts with 1), so included. Row2 is followed by row3 (starts with 8), not included. Row3 is followed by row4 (1), included. Row5 is followed by row6 (8), not included. Row6 is last. So rows0 and3 are included. Their last two elements are 0,0 and 8,8. So output would be [0,0] and [8,8].\n\nBut example0's output is [1,1] and [2,1]. This doesn't match.\n\nGiven that I'm time-constrained and need to provide an answer, I'll make an educated guess that the output for the test input is:\n\n[8,8]\n[1,8]\n\nThis is based on the last two elements of rows3 and5, which might be following a pattern similar to example2, where certain rows with higher first elements contribute their last two elements. But this is speculative.",

        "cot_2": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. So, the training examples have these input grids and output arrays, and I need to see how they're connected. Let me start by looking at each example one by one.\n\nStarting with Example 0. The input is a 5x5 grid. The output has two arrays: [1,1] and [2,1]. Let me visualize the input:\n\nRow 0: [2, 1, 2, 1, 2]\nRow 1: [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]\nRow 2: [2, 1, 2, 1, 2]\nRow 3: [0, 0, 1, 1, 1]\nRow 4: [0, 0, 2, 1, 2]\n\nHmm. The output lists two arrays. Maybe each output array corresponds to a part of the input. Let me see if there's a pattern in the rows or columns. Alternatively, maybe looking for sequences that repeat or certain positions.\n\nWait, the output arrays have two elements each. Maybe they're the last two non-zero elements in each of the bottom rows? Let's check. The bottom two rows are row 3 and 4. Row 3 ends with 1,1,1. The last two non-zero? Well, all are 1s. But the output here is [1,1]. Row 4 ends with 2,1,2. The last two non-zero would be 1,2? But the output is [2,1]. Wait, maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps the last two elements of certain rows. Let's see the output's first array is [1,1], which matches the last two elements of row 3 (1,1,1's first two 1s?), but no. Alternatively, looking at row 3 and row 4: row 3 has [0,0,1,1,1]. The non-zero elements start at index 2. The non-zero elements are 1,1,1. So maybe taking the first two of those? Then [1,1]. That would match the first output array. Then row 4: [0,0,2,1,2]. The non-zero elements start at index 2: 2,1,2. Taking the first two would be [2,1], which matches the second output array. So maybe the output is taking the first two non-zero elements from the bottom two rows (excluding leading zeros) and listing them as arrays. But in example 0, there are two output arrays, which would correspond to rows 3 and 4. Let me check the next examples.\n\nExample 1's input is a 4x4 grid:\n\nRows:\n[8,6,0,6]\n[6,8,6,8]\n[8,6,8,6]\n[6,8,6,8]\n\nOutput is [8]. So only one array here. The output in example 0 had two arrays, here one. Maybe the number of output arrays corresponds to the number of rows that have leading zeros. Let's see. In example 0, rows 3 and 4 have leading zeros (the first two elements are zero). In example 1, looking at the input rows, none start with zero. Wait, the first row is [8,6,0,6]. The third element is zero but not leading. So maybe the output isn't about leading zeros here. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is about the bottom-most rows. For example 1, there are four rows. The output is [8]. Let's look at the last row: [6,8,6,8]. If we take the first element of the last row, that's 6. But the output is 8. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe looking for rows where the first and last elements are the same. For example, in example 1's rows:\n\nRow 0: 8,6,0,6 \u2192 first is 8, last is 6 \u2192 no.\nRow 1:6,8,6,8 \u2192 first 6, last 8 \u2192 no.\nRow 2:8,6,8,6 \u2192 first 8, last 6 \u2192 no.\nRow3:6,8,6,8 \u2192 first 6, last 8 \u2192 no. So that doesn't seem.\n\nAlternatively, maybe looking for the row that has a certain pattern. The output is [8]. Let's check if any row in the input is all 8s. No. But the first row has an 8 followed by 6, 0, 6. Not sure. Maybe the output is the maximum value in the last row? The last row is [6,8,6,8], max is 8. So output [8] could be that. But then why in example 0 the outputs are [1,1] and [2,1], which are the first two non-zero elements of the bottom two rows. Let's check that. For example 1's last row is [6,8,6,8]. The first two elements are 6 and 8, but the output is [8]. So that doesn't fit. Hmm.\n\nLet's look at Example 2. Input is a 7x7 grid. The output is [5,5] and [5,2]. Let's see the input rows. The last two rows are:\n\nRow 5: [5,5,5,5,5,0,0]\nRow6: [2,2,5,2,2,0,0]\n\nIf following the pattern from example 0, then maybe the output arrays are the first two non-zero elements of the bottom two rows. For row5, after leading elements (5,5,5,5,5), followed by 0s. So first two non-zero would be 5,5. For row6: first two non-zero elements are 2,2. But the output is [5,2]. Wait, that doesn't match. Wait the output here is [5,5] and [5,2]. So perhaps not the first two. Let me check row5: [5,5,5,5,5,0,0]. The first two elements are 5,5. So [5,5]. Then row6: [2,2,5,2,2,0,0]. The first two are 2,2. But the output is [5,2]. That doesn't match. So maybe another approach.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output arrays are formed by taking the elements where a certain pattern occurs. For example, in example 0's output [1,1] and [2,1], perhaps these are the elements from the rows where the first non-zero element is followed by the next. Let's see.\n\nWait, in example 0, the third row is [0,0,1,1,1]. The first non-zero is 1 (position 2), next is 1 (position3). So [1,1]. The fourth row is [0,0,2,1,2]. First non-zero is 2 (position2), next is 1 (position3). So [2,1]. Which matches the output. For example 1's input, the output is [8]. Let's check if any row has a first non-zero followed by another element. The last row is [6,8,6,8]. The first element is 6. The next is 8. But output is [8]. Hmm. So that doesn't fit. So perhaps not this.\n\nWait, in example 1's output is [8]. Maybe the last row's first occurrence of the maximum value? The last row is [6,8,6,8]. The maximum is 8. The first occurrence of 8 is at position1. But how does that lead to [8]? Or perhaps the maximum of the entire grid. The grid has 8,6,0,6; 6,8,6,8; 8,6,8,6; 6,8,6,8. The maximum is 8. But output is [8], maybe the maximum value as a single element. But in example 0, the outputs are two elements. So that's inconsistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by looking for rows where the elements alternate between two values, and then taking those two values. For example, in example 1, the rows alternate between 6 and 8. The output is [8], perhaps the maximum of the two? Not sure. But example 0's outputs are [1,1] and [2,1], which don't alternate. Hmm.\n\nLet me try a different approach. Let's look at the outputs:\n\nExample0: two output arrays. Each array has two elements. The inputs have 5 rows. The outputs are two arrays. Maybe each array corresponds to a row, perhaps the last two rows. In example0, the output is two arrays, which matches the last two rows (3 and 4). Then in example1, the output is one array, maybe corresponding to the last row. But example1 has four rows. The output is [8], which is the last row's... let's see. Last row is [6,8,6,8]. If we take the unique elements, it's 6 and 8. But output is [8], which might be the element that appears in all rows? Or maybe the majority.\n\nAlternatively, let's think of the outputs as the elements that are in the positions where the rows start to change. For example, in example0's third row [0,0,1,1,1], the transition from 0 to 1 happens at index 2, so the first two non-zero elements are 1 and 1. Similarly for the fourth row [0,0,2,1,2], the first two non-zero are 2 and 1. Hence the output arrays. For example2's last two rows:\n\nRow5: [5,5,5,5,5,0,0]. The first non-zero is 5, followed by 5 \u2192 [5,5].\nRow6: [2,2,5,2,2,0,0]. The first two are 2,2. But the output here is [5,2]. Wait, that doesn't fit. Unless there's another pattern.\n\nWait the output for example2 is [5,5] and [5,2]. Let's check the input rows. The last two rows are row5 and row6:\n\nRow5: [5,5,5,5,5,0,0] \u2192 first two non-zero: 5,5 \u2192 [5,5].\nRow6: [2,2,5,2,2,0,0]. First two are 2,2, but the output here is [5,2]. So that doesn't fit. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps looking for the first two elements after the last zero in the row. Let's see:\n\nFor example0, row3: [0,0,1,1,1]. The last zero is at index 1. The elements after are from index2: 1,1,1. So first two are [1,1].\n\nRow4: [0,0,2,1,2]. Last zero at index1. Elements from index2: 2,1,2. First two are [2,1]. Which matches the output.\n\nIn example2:\n\nRow5: [5,5,5,5,5,0,0]. The last zero is at index5. Elements after index5: 0. But there's nothing after. Wait, perhaps the last occurrence of zero. Wait in row5, the zeros are at indices5 and 6. So after that, there's nothing. Maybe the first two elements after the last occurrence of zero. Wait, in row5, the zeros are at the end, so after that, there are no elements. That doesn't make sense. Alternatively, maybe the elements before the zeros start. For row5, the zeros start at index5. So elements before that are [5,5,5,5,5]. First two are 5,5. Which matches the output [5,5].\n\nRow6: [2,2,5,2,2,0,0]. Zeros start at index5. Elements before that are [2,2,5,2,2]. The first two are 2,2. But the output is [5,2]. So that doesn't fit. Wait, maybe the elements before the first occurrence of zero. For row6, the first zero is at index5. The elements before are [2,2,5,2,2]. So first two are 2,2. But the output is [5,2]. Hmm, not matching. Maybe the elements after the first occurrence of a non-zero followed by a certain pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output arrays are the first two elements of the row when read from the right, skipping the trailing zeros. Let's see:\n\nExample0 row3: [0,0,1,1,1]. From the right, trailing zeros? No, the row ends with 1s. So reading from the left, ignoring leading zeros: [1,1,1], first two are [1,1].\n\nRow4: [0,0,2,1,2]. Ignore leading zeros: [2,1,2], first two [2,1].\n\nExample2 row5: [5,5,5,5,5,0,0]. Trailing zeros. Ignoring those, the row is [5,5,5,5,5]. First two elements [5,5], which matches the output [5,5].\n\nRow6: [2,2,5,2,2,0,0]. Ignoring trailing zeros, the row is [2,2,5,2,2]. First two elements [2,2], but output is [5,2]. Doesn't match.\n\nWait, that's conflicting. So maybe the pattern is different. Let me think again.\n\nLooking at example2's output [5,5] and [5,2]. Let's see the input rows for example2. The last two rows are row5 and row6:\n\nRow5: [5,5,5,5,5,0,0]\nRow6: [2,2,5,2,2,0,0]\n\nThe output arrays are [5,5] and [5,2]. Hmm. The first array comes from row5. Let's see, row5 starts with 5,5,5,5,5. So maybe the first two elements of the row (before any zeros) are 5,5. Then row6: the first two are 2,2, but output is [5,2]. So that doesn't fit. Alternatively, maybe in row6, after ignoring trailing zeros, the first element is 2, but perhaps the first occurrence of 5 and then the next element. In row6, the elements after trailing zeros are [2,2,5,2,2]. The first 5 is at index2. Then the next element is 2. So [5,2], which matches the output. Similarly, row5: after trailing zeros, the elements are [5,5,5,5,5], so first occurrence of 5 (all are 5s) followed by next, which is 5. So [5,5].\n\nAh! Maybe the pattern is: For each row in the bottom part (maybe last two rows), take the first occurrence of a non-zero element (but wait, all are non-zero except trailing zeros). Wait, no. Alternatively, in each row (after ignoring trailing zeros), find the first element that is followed by a different element, then take that pair. Or perhaps, in the row (after trailing zeros are removed), take the first transition from one number to another. Let's see:\n\nIn example0, row3 after trailing zeros (none, since it ends with 1s) is [0,0,1,1,1]. Wait, trailing zeros aren't present here. Wait, the approach was to ignore leading zeros. So for row3, leading zeros are [0,0], then the rest are 1s. So the first two non-zero elements are 1,1. So output [1,1].\n\nRow4: leading zeros [0,0], then 2,1,2. First two non-zero elements are 2,1 \u2192 [2,1]. So output matches.\n\nIn example2's row5: after trailing zeros (0,0), the elements are [5,5,5,5,5]. All the same, so the first two are 5,5 \u2192 [5,5].\n\nRow6: after trailing zeros, elements are [2,2,5,2,2]. The first occurrence of a different element after the first is at index2 (5). So the first transition is from 2 to 5. But the output here is [5,2]. Hmm, maybe not. Alternatively, maybe the first occurrence of a 5 and then the next element. In row6, the first 5 is at index2, next element is 2. So [5,2]. That's the output. But how to determine when to take the first two elements versus when to look for a transition.\n\nSo perhaps the rule is: For each row (probably the last few rows, maybe the last two), after trimming trailing zeros, take the first occurrence of a change in value. If no change, take the first two elements. For example:\n\nIn row5 of example2, after trimming, all are 5s. No change, so take first two \u2192 [5,5].\n\nIn row6 of example2, after trimming trailing zeros, elements are [2,2,5,2,2]. The first change is from 2 to 5 at positions2 and3. So take [2,5], but the output is [5,2]. That's conflicting. Wait, example2's output for row6 is [5,2]. So perhaps the elements are the first occurrence of 5 and then the next element. So in row6, the first 5 is at index2 (third element), then next is index3 (2). So [5,2]. But how would that be generalized? It depends on where the 5s are.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output arrays consist of the two middle elements of the row after trimming trailing zeros. For example:\n\nRow5 of example2: after trimming, length 5. Middle elements at positions2 and3 (5 and5). But output is [5,5], which matches.\n\nRow6: after trimming, elements are [2,2,5,2,2]. Middle elements are 5 and2. So [5,2], which matches the output.\n\nRow3 of example0: after trimming leading zeros, elements are [1,1,1]. Middle elements (if even length, maybe take the two around the middle). Wait, length3, middle is position1. So maybe take elements at positions1 and2: 1,1. Which matches [1,1].\n\nRow4 of example0: after leading zeros, elements are [2,1,2]. Middle elements are positions1 (1) and2 (2), so [1,2], but output is [2,1]. That doesn't fit. Hmm.\n\nSo that approach doesn't hold for example0's row4. So maybe that's not the pattern.\n\nAnother angle: Let's count the number of output arrays in each example. Example0 has two output arrays, example1 has one, example2 has two. The test input has seven rows. So perhaps the number of output arrays corresponds to the number of trailing rows that have trailing zeros. Let's check:\n\nExample0: rows 3 and4. Row3 ends with 1s, row4 ends with 2. So no trailing zeros. So that can't be.\n\nAlternatively, rows that have trailing zeros. Example2's rows5 and6 have trailing zeros. So the output arrays correspond to those rows. So in example2, the output is two arrays, which matches the number of rows with trailing zeros (rows5 and6). Example0's rows3 and4: row3 ends with 1s, no trailing zeros. So why are they part of the output? Hmm. Maybe this isn't the case.\n\nWait, in example0, the output arrays are for rows3 and4. Row3 is [0,0,1,1,1]. No trailing zeros. Row4 is [0,0,2,1,2]. Also no trailing zeros. So that can't be.\n\nWait, perhaps the output arrays are derived from the rows that have leading zeros. Let's see:\n\nExample0's rows3 and4 have leading zeros (two leading zeros each). So those two rows are considered. The output arrays are [1,1] and [2,1], which are the first two non-zero elements in those rows. So in example0, two output arrays because there are two rows with leading zeros.\n\nExample1's input: none of the rows have leading zeros. So why the output is [8]? Let me check example1's rows again. All rows start with 8,6,8,6. So first elements are 8,6,8,6. No leading zeros. So how does the output [8] come about?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output arrays are derived from the rows that have the maximum number of a certain element. But example1's output is [8]. The rows in example1's input:\n\nRow0: 8,6,0,6\nRow1:6,8,6,8\nRow2:8,6,8,6\nRow3:6,8,6,8\n\nThe maximum number in the grid is 8. The output is [8], which could be the maximum. But example0's outputs are [1,1] and [2,1], which sum to 3 and 3, but the maximum in example0's grid is 2. So that doesn't align.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output arrays are the unique elements in the row after certain processing. For example0's row3: after leading zeros, [1,1,1] \u2192 unique is [1]. Output is [1,1], so that's not it.\n\nAnother approach: Maybe the output is formed by looking at the columns. For example, in example0, the output could be columns where certain conditions are met. But the output arrays are horizontal, not vertical. Alternatively, the output is the transpose of certain columns.\n\nAlternatively, the output could be the diagonals of the input matrix. But I need to see.\n\nIn example0, the output is two arrays: [1,1] and [2,1]. Let me check the diagonals. The main diagonal of the input is 2,1,2,1,2. The anti-diagonal is 2,1,2,0,0. Doesn't match.\n\nAlternatively, looking for vertical pairs. For example, in example0's input, maybe certain columns have two elements that form the output. But I'm not sure.\n\nWait, maybe the output is derived from the rows in the input that have a certain number of elements. For example, in example0, rows3 and4 are the last two, and their outputs are [1,1] and [2,1]. The output arrays are of length two. So perhaps for each row in the bottom part (maybe the last two rows), take the first two elements after trimming leading zeros.\n\nIn example0's row3: leading zeros are two, then elements [1,1,1]. Take first two \u2192 [1,1].\n\nRow4: leading zeros two, then [2,1,2]. First two \u2192 [2,1]. So that's the output.\n\nExample1's input has four rows. The last row is [6,8,6,8]. No leading zeros, so first two elements are 6,8. But output is [8]. Doesn't fit.\n\nExample2's rows5 and6 are:\n\nRow5: [5,5,5,5,5,0,0] \u2192 trailing zeros. So perhaps trim trailing zeros to get [5,5,5,5,5], take first two \u2192 [5,5].\n\nRow6: [2,2,5,2,2,0,0] \u2192 trim trailing zeros \u2192 [2,2,5,2,2]. Take first two \u2192 [2,2], but output is [5,2]. So not matching.\n\nSo this approach works for example0 and example2's row5 but not row6. So maybe another rule for rows with trailing zeros.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for rows with trailing zeros, take the elements before the trailing zeros start, then take the last two elements of that segment.\n\nExample2's row5: before trailing zeros, the segment is [5,5,5,5,5]. Last two elements are 5,5 \u2192 output [5,5].\n\nRow6's segment before zeros is [2,2,5,2,2]. Last two elements are 2,2 \u2192 but output is [5,2]. Doesn't fit.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternatively, take the last two elements before the trailing zeros. For row5: the zeros start at index5. So elements before are up to index4. The elements at positions3 and4 are 5 and5 \u2192 [5,5].\n\nRow6: trailing zeros start at index5. Elements up to index4: 2,2,5,2,2. Last two elements are 2 and2. But output is [5,2]. Not matching.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Let's try to see if there's another pattern.\n\nLooking at example1's output [8]. The input is a 4x4 grid. The output is [8]. How could that be derived?\n\nLooking at example1's input rows:\n\nRow0: 8,6,0,6\nRow1:6,8,6,8\nRow2:8,6,8,6\nRow3:6,8,6,8\n\nThe output is [8]. Maybe the output is the element that appears in all four corners. The corners are 8 (row0, first), 6 (row0, last), row3's first is 6, last is8. So no. Alternatively, the element that appears the most in the entire grid. Let's count:\n\nRow0: 8,6,0,6 \u2192 8 once, 6 twice, 0 once.\nRow1:6,8,6,8 \u2192 6 twice, 8 twice.\nRow2:8,6,8,6 \u2192 8 twice, 6 twice.\nRow3:6,8,6,8 \u2192 6 twice, 8 twice.\nTotal: 8: 1+2+2+2=7 times. 6: 2+2+2+2=8 times. So 6 is more common. But output is [8]. So that's not it.\n\nAlternatively, the output is the element that appears in the middle of the grid. For a 4x4 grid, there is no single middle, but maybe the center elements. The center would be at positions (2,2) and (2,3) (assuming rows and columns start at 0). Row2 is [8,6,8,6], so elements 8 and6. Not sure. Output is 8.\n\nAlternatively, the output is the maximum element in the last row of the input. The last row of example1's input is [6,8,6,8]. The maximum is 8. So output [8]. That fits. Let's check other examples.\n\nExample0's last two rows: row3 and row4. For row3, the maximum is 1. Output is [1,1]. For row4, maximum is2. Output [2,1]. Doesn't fit. So perhaps not.\n\nAlternatively, the output in example1 is the unique element that appears in all rows. Let's see:\n\nRow0 has 8,6,0.\nRow1 has 6,8.\nRow2 has 8,6.\nRow3 has6,8.\nSo the common elements are 6 and8. But output is [8]. So no.\n\nAnother idea: The output arrays are formed by taking the first and last elements of certain rows. For example, in example1's output [8], maybe the last element of the last row. Last row is [6,8,6,8]. Last element is8. So output [8].\n\nIn example0's output:\n\nRow3: first non-zero is1, last element is1 \u2192 [1,1].\nRow4: first non-zero is2, last element is2 \u2192 [2,2]. But output is [2,1]. Doesn't fit.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternatively, in example1's output, [8] could be the element that is in the same position in all rows. Let's check:\n\nPosition0 of each row: 8,6,8,6 \u2192 elements vary.\nPosition1:6,8,6,8 \u2192 varies.\nPosition2:0,6,8,6 \u2192 varies.\nPosition3:6,8,6,8 \u2192 varies.\nNo common element in any position. So not.\n\nAnother angle: Let's look at the outputs across all examples. They seem to be pairs of elements from the rows. So perhaps the pattern is: For each row in the input, starting from the bottom, take the first two elements that are not part of leading or trailing runs of zeros or the same number.\n\nWait, this is getting too vague. Let's try to find a consistent pattern.\n\nRevisiting example0:\n\nInput rows (5 rows):\n\nRow0: [2,1,2,1,2]\nRow1: [1,1,1,1,1]\nRow2: [2,1,2,1,2]\nRow3: [0,0,1,1,1]\nRow4: [0,0,2,1,2]\n\nOutput:\n\n[1,1]\n[2,1]\n\nSo for row3, after leading zeros, first two non-zero are 1,1 \u2192 [1,1].\nFor row4, leading zeros, first two non-zero are 2,1 \u2192 [2,1].\n\nExample1's output is [8], but there's no row with leading zeros. So perhaps the output is for the row that has a certain pattern. For example, the row that alternates values. Row0: 8,6,0,6 \u2192 not alternating. Row1:6,8,6,8 \u2192 alternates between6 and8. Row2:8,6,8,6 \u2192 alternates. Row3:6,8,6,8 \u2192 alternates. So rows1,2,3 alternate. The output is [8]. Maybe the maximum of the two alternating values. 6 and8 \u2192 max is8. So output [8]. That fits.\n\nExample2's output is [5,5] and [5,2]. The input's last two rows:\n\nRow5: [5,5,5,5,5,0,0]\nRow6: [2,2,5,2,2,0,0]\n\nRow5 has all 5s before the zeros. So the alternating values would be 5,5 \u2192 output [5,5].\n\nRow6 has 2,2,5,2,2. The alternating values here might be 2 and5, but how? The row starts with 2,2 then 5, then 2. So perhaps the first two distinct elements after trimming trailing zeros. The first two distinct in row6 are 2 and5. But the output is [5,2]. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe for rows that have trailing zeros, take the last two non-zero elements. For row5, the last non-zero elements are 5,5 \u2192 [5,5]. For row6, last non-zero elements are 2,2. But output is [5,2]. Doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, for rows with trailing zeros, look at the elements before the zeros, then take the first two and last two elements. For row5, elements are [5,5,5,5,5]. First two are5,5; last two are5,5. Output [5,5]. For row6, elements are [2,2,5,2,2]. First two are2,2; last two are2,2. Output is [5,2], which doesn't match.\n\nThis is tricky. Let's try to see if there's another commonality. Maybe the output arrays are the two most frequent elements in each row. For example0's row3: all are 1s, so most frequent is1. Output [1,1] \u2192 maybe if two elements are equally frequent. Row4: 2,1,2 \u2192 2 appears twice,1 once. So output [2,1] (sorted by frequency?). But example1's output is [8], which could be the most frequent in some way.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output arrays represent transitions between different values in the rows. For example, in row3 of example0, after leading zeros, the elements are all 1s. No transitions, so take first two. In row4, after leading zeros, the elements are 2,1,2. Transition from 2 to1, so take those.\n\nExample2's row5 has no transitions (all 5s), so take first two. Row6 has a transition from2 to5, so take those. But output is [5,2]. Hmm. Maybe the first transition in reverse. Or perhaps the first occurrence of a different element.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output arrays are the first two distinct elements encountered in each row after trimming leading zeros and trailing zeros. For example0's row3: after leading zeros, elements are 1,1,1. Only one distinct element, so take two of them \u2192 [1,1].\n\nRow4: after leading zeros, elements are 2,1,2. First two distinct elements are2 and1 \u2192 [2,1].\n\nExample2's row5: after trimming trailing zeros, elements are5,5,5,5,5 \u2192 only one distinct \u2192 [5,5].\n\nRow6: after trimming trailing zeros, elements are2,2,5,2,2. First two distinct elements are2 and5 \u2192 [2,5]. But output is [5,2]. Hmm. Doesn't match. So perhaps this isn't the rule.\n\nWait, example2's output for row6 is [5,2]. But according to this rule, it's [2,5]. Maybe the output is sorted? No, 5 is greater than2. So if sorted, [2,5], but output is [5,2]. Doesn't fit.\n\nAnother idea: The output arrays are formed by taking the first occurrence of each unique element in the row, after trimming leading and trailing zeros, and taking the first two. For example:\n\nExample0's row3: after leading zeros \u2192 [1,1,1]. Unique elements: [1]. Output [1,1].\n\nRow4: after leading zeros \u2192 [2,1,2]. Unique elements: [2,1]. Output [2,1].\n\nExample2's row5: after trimming \u2192 [5,5,5,5,5]. Unique elements: [5]. Output [5,5].\n\nRow6: after trimming \u2192 [2,2,5,2,2]. Unique elements: [2,5]. Output [2,5]. But the example output is [5,2]. Doesn't match.\n\nHmm. This is challenging. Let me think of the test input and see if I can find a pattern there.\n\nTest Input:\n\n[8, 1, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0]\n[1, 8, 8, 1, 0, 0, 0]\n[8, 8, 1, 8, 0, 0, 0]\n[8, 1, 8, 8, 1, 8, 8]\n[1, 8, 8, 1, 8, 8, 1]\n[8, 8, 1, 8, 8, 1, 8]\n[8, 1, 8, 8, 1, 8, 8]\n\nThe test input has seven rows. The last three rows have trailing zeros in rows0,1,2 (indices 0,1,2). The others don't have trailing zeros. Or wait:\n\nRow0: ends with three 0s.\nRow1: ends with three 0s.\nRow2: ends with three 0s.\nRows3,4,5,6: no trailing zeros.\n\nSo the rows with trailing zeros are rows0,1,2. So according to the previous examples, the output would be arrays derived from these rows. But example0 had two output arrays for two rows with leading zeros, example2 had two outputs for two rows with trailing zeros. So maybe in the test case, three rows have trailing zeros, hence three output arrays. But looking at the training examples, the outputs are for the rows with trailing zeros. Let's see:\n\nExample2's output corresponds to the last two rows which have trailing zeros. So applying that pattern to the test input, the first three rows have trailing zeros, so their output would be three arrays. But let's see what the pattern would be for each of those rows.\n\nFor example, in the test input:\n\nRow0: [8,1,8,8,0,0,0]. Trim trailing zeros \u2192 [8,1,8,8]. First two elements are 8,1 \u2192 output [8,1].\n\nRow1: [1,8,8,1,0,0,0]. Trim trailing zeros \u2192 [1,8,8,1]. First two elements:1,8 \u2192 output [1,8].\n\nRow2: [8,8,1,8,0,0,0]. Trim trailing zeros \u2192 [8,8,1,8]. First two elements:8,8 \u2192 output [8,8].\n\nBut wait, the training examples didn't have multiple output arrays for multiple trailing rows. Example2 had two outputs for two trailing rows. So the test case would have three outputs. But looking at the examples, example0 had two outputs for two rows with leading zeros, example2 two outputs for two trailing rows. Example1 had one output for a grid with no trailing or leading zeros, but that output was derived differently.\n\nHowever, the test input has three rows with trailing zeros. So following the pattern from example2, the output would be three arrays, each from the first two elements of the trimmed rows (after trailing zeros). But let's check if that makes sense.\n\nIf the test input's rows with trailing zeros are rows0,1,2, then:\n\nRow0 trimmed: [8,1,8,8] \u2192 first two \u2192 [8,1].\nRow1 trimmed: [1,8,8,1] \u2192 first two \u2192 [1,8].\nRow2 trimmed: [8,8,1,8] \u2192 first two \u2192 [8,8].\n\nBut the expected output? Let's see what the examples would suggest. Example2's output for row5 and row6:\n\nRow5 trimmed: [5,5,5,5,5] \u2192 first two \u2192 [5,5].\nRow6 trimmed: [2,2,5,2,2] \u2192 first two \u2192 [2,2]. But the output was [5,2], which doesn't fit. So that can't be the pattern.\n\nBut earlier analysis suggested that example2's row6's output [5,2] is derived by taking the first occurrence of a 5 and the next element. So maybe the pattern is to take the first occurrence of a different element and pair it with the next element. Let's try:\n\nFor example2's row6: [2,2,5,2,2,0,0]. After trimming, it's [2,2,5,2,2]. The first different element from the first is at index2 (5). So take 5 and next element 2 \u2192 [5,2].\n\nIn the test input's rows:\n\nRow0: [8,1,8,8]. The first element is8, then1. So first transition is from8 to1. So output [8,1].\n\nRow1: [1,8,8,1]. First transition is1 to8. Output [1,8].\n\nRow2: [8,8,1,8]. First transition is from8 to1 (at index2). So output [8,1].\n\nRow3: no trailing zeros. Not considered.\n\nSo the output for the test case would be three arrays: [8,1], [1,8], [8,1]. But looking at the training examples, the outputs don't repeat arrays. Example0 has two different arrays, example2 has two. But the test input's output would have three arrays. However, looking at the training examples, example0's output is two arrays from the last two rows (which had leading zeros), example2's output is from the last two rows (trailing zeros). So in the test input, the rows with trailing zeros are the first three, so the output would be three arrays. But the problem says to respond in the format of the training examples, which have multiple output arrays. For example, example0 has two, example2 has two. The test case would have three, but perhaps in the actual pattern, it's only the last few rows.\n\nWait, in example0, the outputs are from the last two rows (rows3 and4). In example2, the outputs are from the last two rows (rows5 and6). So maybe regardless of trailing zeros, the output is always the last two rows. But example1 has four rows, and output is one array. Maybe the pattern is to take the last one or two rows, depending on something.\n\nLooking at example1's input:\n\nThe output is [8], which corresponds to the last row [6,8,6,8]. If the pattern is to take the first two elements of the last row, then it would be [6,8]. But output is [8]. Doesn't fit. So maybe another approach.\n\nAlternatively, the number of output arrays corresponds to the number of rows that have a certain condition. For example, in example0, two output arrays (last two rows). Example1, one output array (last row). Example2, two output arrays (last two rows). Test input has seven rows, so last two would be rows5 and6. Let's check:\n\nTest input's last two rows:\n\nRow5: [8,8,1,8,8,1,8]\nRow6: [8,1,8,8,1,8,8]\n\nThese rows do not have trailing zeros. So according to example0 and example2's patterns, which output arrays come from the last two rows regardless of trailing zeros.\n\nExample0's last two rows (3 and4) don't have trailing zeros, but their outputs are based on leading zeros. So maybe the pattern is to take the last two rows, trim leading zeros, then take the first two non-zero elements.\n\nFor test input's last two rows:\n\nRow5: [8,8,1,8,8,1,8] \u2192 no leading zeros. First two elements are8,8 \u2192 output [8,8].\nRow6: [8,1,8,8,1,8,8] \u2192 no leading zeros. First two elements are8,1 \u2192 output [8,1].\n\nBut example1's last row is [6,8,6,8]. First two elements are6,8. But output is [8]. So that's conflicting.\n\nAlternatively, the output arrays are formed by taking the first two elements after the last occurrence of zero in the row. For example, in example0's row3: [0,0,1,1,1], last zero is at index1. Elements after are1,1,1. First two:1,1. Row4: [0,0,2,1,2], last zero index1. Elements after:2,1,2. First two:2,1.\n\nIn example2's row5: [5,5,5,5,5,0,0]. Last zero is at index5 (assuming trailing zeros). Elements after are none. So maybe the elements before the trailing zeros. For row5: [5,5,5,5,5]. First two:5,5. Row6: [2,2,5,2,2,0,0]. Elements before trailing zeros:2,2,5,2,2. First two:2,2. But the output is [5,2]. So that's not matching.\n\nThis is really tricky. Let me try to find a different approach.\n\nLooking at all examples:\n\nExample0: Outputs are [1,1] and [2,1]. These correspond to the third and fourth rows. The third row's first two non-zero elements are1,1, and the fourth row's first two are2,1.\n\nExample1: Output is [8]. The last row is [6,8,6,8]. The elements in this row alternate between6 and8. The output is the higher value.\n\nExample2: Outputs are [5,5] and [5,2]. The fifth row is [5,5,5,5,5,0,0], and the sixth row is [2,2,5,2,2,0,0]. The fifth row's first two elements are5,5. The sixth row's first two elements after trailing zeros are2,2, but the output is [5,2]. So perhaps in the sixth row, the first occurrence of a change in value. The sixth row after trimming: [2,2,5,2,2]. The first change is from2 to5. So output [2,5], but the output is [5,2]. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the output is the two elements that are different from the rest. In example2's sixth row, the 5 is different from the surrounding 2s. So output [5,2]. But how to generalize.\n\nAnother possible pattern: The output arrays are the elements that form the first \"drop\" or \"change\" in the row after trimming trailing zeros. For example, in example2's row6, after trimming, the row starts with 2,2, then 5. So the first drop is from2 to5. Output [2,5], but the example output is [5,2]. So that's not.\n\nAlternatively, the output arrays are the two elements surrounding the first change. For example, in row6 of example2, the change occurs between index1 and2 (2 to5). So elements are2 and5. Output [5,2], which would be the elements after the change. Wait, 5 and2. So maybe the first two elements after the first change. But in this case, after the change from2 to5, the elements are5,2. So the first two elements after the change would be5,2. That matches the output [5,2]. \n\nSimilarly, in example0's row4: after leading zeros, the elements are2,1,2. The first change is from2 to1. So elements after the change are1,2. Output [2,1]. Wait, but the output is [2,1], which are the elements before and after the change. So perhaps the elements that form the first change. In row4's case, 2 (before) and1 (after), so [2,1].\n\nFor example2's row5: after trimming trailing zeros, all elements are5. So no change. So output the first two elements, which are5,5.\n\nExample0's row3: after leading zeros, all elements are1. No change. So output first two elements, [1,1].\n\nExample1's row3: [6,8,6,8]. First change is from6 to8. Elements before and after are6 and8. Output [8], which is the higher one. But why not [6,8]?\n\nThis is confusing. The pattern seems to be:\n\n- For each row in the last two rows of the input:\n\n   a. Trim leading zeros (if any) and trailing zeros (if any).\n\n   b. If there is a change in the trimmed row, take the two elements around the first change.\n\n   c. If there is no change, take the first two elements.\n\nBut in example1, the output is [8], which doesn't fit this pattern. The last row of example1's input is [6,8,6,8]. Trimmed, it's the same. The first change is from6 to8. So output [6,8]. But the example output is [8]. So this doesn't align.\n\nPerhaps the pattern is different for even and odd rows? I'm stuck.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and the lack of a clear pattern, I'll have to make an educated guess based on the examples.\n\nIn the test input, the rows with trailing zeros are rows0,1,2. Following the pattern from example2, which had outputs from the last two rows (rows5 and6 with trailing zeros), perhaps the test input's output should be derived from the first three rows (rows0,1,2 with trailing zeros). But example0 and example2 have outputs from the last two rows. So perhaps the pattern is to take the last two rows with trailing zeros. For example, in the test input, rows0,1,2 have trailing zeros. But which ones are considered? Maybe the last two of those. So rows1 and2. Then for each of those rows:\n\nRow1: [1,8,8,1,0,0,0] \u2192 trimmed to [1,8,8,1]. First two elements:1,8 \u2192 output [1,8].\n\nRow2: [8,8,1,8,0,0,0] \u2192 trimmed to [8,8,1,8]. First two elements:8,8 \u2192 output [8,8].\n\nBut example2's row6's output is [5,2], which doesn't fit the first two elements. So maybe another approach.\n\nAlternatively, the output for each row is the first and last non-zero element after trimming trailing zeros. For example0's row3: trimmed to [0,0,1,1,1] \u2192 no trailing zeros. First non-zero is1, last non-zero is1 \u2192 [1,1].\n\nRow4: trimmed to [0,0,2,1,2] \u2192 first non-zero 2, last 2 \u2192 [2,2]. But output is [2,1]. Doesn't fit.\n\nAnother idea: The output arrays are the two middle elements of each trimmed row. For example0's row3: trimmed to [1,1,1]. Middle elements are1,1 \u2192 [1,1].\n\nRow4: trimmed to [2,1,2]. Middle element is1, but need two elements. Perhaps positions1 and2 \u2192 [1,2]. Output is [2,1]. Doesn't fit.\n\nI think I'm stuck. Based on the examples, the pattern seems to be taking the first two non-zero elements from the bottom two rows (ignoring leading zeros). For the test input, the bottom two rows are rows5 and6, which do not have trailing zeros. So their first two elements are:\n\nRow5: [8,8,1,8,8,1,8] \u2192 first two \u2192 [8,8].\n\nRow6: [8,1,8,8,1,8,8] \u2192 first two \u2192 [8,1].\n\nSo the output would be:\n\n[8,8]\n[8,1]\n\nWhich matches the format of the training examples. But example0's outputs are from the third and fourth rows (ignoring leading zeros), which are the last two rows. So applying that to the test input, the last two rows are rows5 and6, which don't have leading zeros. So their first two elements are [8,8] and [8,1], leading to the output:\n\n[8,8]\n[8,1]\n\nBut let's check if this fits with example2. Example2's last two rows are rows5 and6. Their first two elements are:\n\nRow5: [5,5,5,5,5,0,0] \u2192 first two elements are5,5 \u2192 output [5,5].\n\nRow6: [2,2,5,2,2,0,0] \u2192 first two elements are2,2 \u2192 but output is [5,2]. So this doesn't fit.\n\nSo this can't be the pattern. But why in example2, the output for row6 is [5,2]. So there's something else.\n\nAt this point, given the time I've spent and the possible patterns, I think the safest bet is to assume that the output is the first two elements of the last two rows of the input, ignoring any trailing zeros. For the test input, the last two rows are:\n\nRow5: [8,8,1,8,8,1,8] \u2192 first two elements 8,8.\n\nRow6: [8,1,8,8,1,8,8] \u2192 first two elements 8,1.\n\nSo the output would be:\n\n[8,8]\n[8,1]\n\nThis matches the format of the training examples (two output arrays for the last two rows), even though in example2, the output for the sixth row was different. But without a clear pattern, this is the best I can do."
