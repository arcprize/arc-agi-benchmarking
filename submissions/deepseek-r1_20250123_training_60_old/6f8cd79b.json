        "cot_1": "Okay, let's look at these training examples to figure out the pattern. All the inputs are matrices filled with zeros, and the outputs seem to replace some of those zeros with eights. Let me check each example step by step.\n\nStarting with Example 0: a 3x3 matrix. The output has 8s around the edges and a 0 in the center. So the first and last rows are all 8s, the middle row has 8s at the ends and 0 in the middle. So maybe it's creating a border of 8s except for the center in odd-sized matrices.\n\nExample 1 is a 4x3 matrix. The output's first and last rows are all 8s. The middle rows have 8s at the ends and 0 in the middle. Wait, but the input here is 4 rows. The output has the first and last rows as all 8s, and the second and third rows have 8s at the ends with 0 in the middle. So for even number of rows, the middle rows (excluding first and last) have their middle elements as 0, but since the columns are three, maybe the middle column is the second one? So for a 4x3, each middle row has the middle element (position 1) as 0, others as 8. Hmm.\n\nExample 2 is a 5x4 matrix. The output has all 8s in the first and last rows. The middle rows have 8s at the start and end, and 0s in the middle two columns. So for a 5x4, columns 0 and 3 are 8, 1 and 2 are 0. So the border is the first and last row (all 8s), and the first and last columns in other rows are 8, with the inner columns 0.\n\nExample 3 is a 5x6 matrix. The output's first and last rows are all 8s. The rows in between have 8 at the start and end, and 0s in between. So for a 5x6 matrix, each middle row (rows 1-3) has 8 at positions 0 and 5, and 0s in columns 1-4.\n\nSo the pattern seems to be:\n\n- For any input matrix (all zeros initially), the transformation creates a border of 8s around the matrix. The first and last rows are entirely 8s. In the other rows, only the first and last elements are 8s, and the inner elements remain 0. However, if the number of columns is such that there's a central column (like in the 3x3 case), the center becomes 0. Wait, in the first example (3x3), the middle row has 8, 0, 8. So the middle element is 0. But in a 4x3 matrix (example 1), each middle row (rows 1 and 2) have 8,0,8. So even when the number of rows is even, but columns are odd, the middle column is set to 0. Wait, columns in example 1 are 3, so middle column is index 1.\n\nSo generalizing, the output is:\n\n- All elements in the first and last rows are 8.\n- For the rows in between (not first or last), the first and last elements are 8, and the rest are 0, regardless of the number of columns. Wait, but looking at example 3, which is 5 rows and 6 columns. The middle rows (rows 1-3) have 8 followed by four 0s and then 8. Since columns are 6, positions 0 and 5 are 8, 1-4 are 0. Similarly, example 2 is 5 rows, 4 columns: each middle row has 8, 0, 0, 8. So it's not about the middle column, but about the first and last elements of each row. Except for the first and last rows, which are all 8.\n\nSo the rule is: turn the entire first and last rows into 8s. For the rows in between, set the first and last elements to 8, and leave the rest as 0. That seems to fit all examples.\n\nNow let's check the test input. The test input is a 7x6 matrix. So 7 rows and 6 columns. According to the pattern:\n\n- First and last rows should be all 8s (since they are 6 columns, each element is 8).\n- The rows in between (rows 1 to 5) should have first and last elements as 8, and the middle four elements as 0.\n\nSo for each of the middle 5 rows, the array would be [8,0,0,0,0,8].\n\nLet me verify with the examples. Example 3 has 5 rows and 6 columns. The output rows 1-3 are [8,0,0,0,0,8]. So yes. So the test case's output should be:\n\n[8,8,8,8,8,8]\n\n[8,0,0,0,0,8]\n\n[8,0,0,0,0,8]\n\n[8,0,0,0,0,8]\n\n[8,0,0,0,0,8]\n\n[8,0,0,0,0,8]\n\n[8,8,8,8,8,8]\n\nWhich matches the pattern. Each middle row has 8 at start and end, 0s in between. First and last rows all 8s.",

        "cot_2": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. So, the input is a matrix of zeros, and the output transforms those zeros into 8s but leaves some zeros in the middle. Let's look at the examples one by one.\n\nStarting with Example 0: a 3x3 matrix. The output has 8s everywhere except the center element which remains 0. So the first and last rows are all 8s, the middle row has 8s on the ends and 0 in the middle. That looks like a border, but with the middle element zeroed out. Wait, no, in 3x3, the output's borders are all 8s except the middle row's center is 0. Hmm, maybe it's forming a frame, but the inner parts are 0?\n\nWait, for 3x3, the output is:\n\n[8,8,8]\n\n[8,0,8]\n\n[8,8,8]\n\nSo the center is 0. So maybe the rule is that all elements except the center are 8. But for even-sized matrices? Let's check Example 1. Example 1 is a 4x3 matrix. The output has first and last rows all 8s. The middle rows (second and third) have 8s at the ends and 0 in the middle. Wait, the input is 4 rows, 3 columns. The output for that is:\n\n[8,8,8]\n\n[8,0,8]\n\n[8,0,8]\n\n[8,8,8]\n\nSo here, the first and last rows are all 8s, and the middle rows have 0 in the center. So maybe for each row, if it's the first or last row, all elements are 8. For the inner rows, the first and last elements are 8, and the middle ones are 0. But wait, the columns also vary. Let's see.\n\nWait Example 2 is 5 rows, 4 columns. The output is:\n\n[8,8,8,8]\n\n[8,0,0,8]\n\n[8,0,0,8]\n\n[8,0,0,8]\n\n[8,8,8,8]\n\nSo first and last rows are all 8s. The middle rows (rows 2,3,4) have 8s at the first and last positions, 0s in between. So the number of columns in the input is 4. So for each row that's not the first or last, the first and last elements are 8, others 0. Similarly, in Example 3, which is 5 rows, 6 columns. Output has first and last rows all 8s. The middle rows (rows 2,3,4) have 8s at the ends and 0s in between. So for rows between first and last, it's 8 at the start and end, 0s in the middle. \n\nSo the pattern seems to be:\n\n- For all rows except the first and last, set the first and last elements to 8 and the rest to 0.\n\n- For the first and last rows, set all elements to 8.\n\nWait but wait, in Example 0, the middle row is [8,0,8], which follows that. For the first and last rows, all 8s. For the middle row (only one in 3x3), first and last 8, middle 0. Similarly for 4 rows (like example 1), the middle two rows (rows 2 and 3) have first and last 8, middle 0. For columns: example 0 has 3 columns. Middle column (index 1) is 0 in the middle row. So perhaps the number of columns affects whether the middle elements are 0. Wait, maybe for each row that's not the first or last, the first and last elements are 8, and the others are 0, regardless of the column count. Let's check:\n\nExample 0: 3x3. Middle row: [8,0,8]. Correct.\n\nExample 1: 4x3. Rows 1 and 2 (second and third rows) are [8,0,8]. Correct.\n\nExample 2: 5x4. Rows 1,2,3 (second, third, fourth) are [8,0,0,8]. Wait, columns 4, so the first and last elements are 8, and the middle two are 0. So for a row with even number of elements? Wait 4 columns: positions 0,1,2,3. So first (0) and last (3) are 8, the rest (1 and 2) are 0. So that's correct.\n\nSo the pattern is:\n\nFor each row in the input matrix:\n\n- If the row is the first or last in the matrix, replace all elements with 8.\n\n- Otherwise, replace the first and last elements with 8, and set the rest to 0.\n\nWait, but let's check Example 3. Input is 5x6. Output for middle rows (rows 2,3,4) have 8s at the first and last positions, and 0s in between. For 6 elements, the first (index 0) and last (index 5) are 8, the others (indices 1-4) are 0. So yes, regardless of the number of columns, the first and last elements of non-border rows are 8, others 0.\n\nSo the transformation is:\n\n- For each row:\n\n   - If it's the first or last row: all elements become 8.\n\n   - Else: first and last elements are 8, others remain 0 (or are set to 0 if original was 0? But in all examples input is all zeros, so the output is 8s where needed and 0s elsewhere).\n\nSo applying this to the test input. The test input is a 7x6 matrix. So 7 rows, each with 6 elements.\n\nSo the first and last rows (row 0 and row 6) will all be 8s. The rows in between (rows 1-5) will have first and last elements 8, others 0.\n\nSo the output should be:\n\nRow 0: [8,8,8,8,8,8]\n\nRows 1-5: [8,0,0,0,0,8]\n\nRow 6: [8,8,8,8,8,8]\n\nWhich matches the pattern seen in the training examples. For example, in Example 3, which was a 5-row input, the first and last rows are all 8s, the middle three rows have 8s at the ends. The test case has 7 rows, so same logic applies."
