        "cot_1": "Okay, let's see. I need to figure out the pattern from the training examples and apply it to the test input. Let's start by looking at the examples.\n\nIn Example 0, the input is a 3x3 matrix. The output is the same matrix but each row is doubled in length. For instance, the first row [0,5,0] becomes [0,5,0,0,5,0]. Wait, it's like the original row is concatenated with a modified version of itself. Let me check each element. Oh, the original row is followed by the same elements but some might be changing? Wait, let's look closer. \n\nOriginal row 1: [0,5,0]. Output row 1: [0,5,0,0,5,0]. So the first three elements are the same, then the next three are the same as the original? Wait, yes, it's just the original row repeated twice. Wait, no, because in Example 0's output, the second part of the first row is [0,5,0], same as original. So maybe each row is duplicated. But looking at the second row: input [5,5,2], output [5,5,2,5,5,2]. So yes, it's duplicated. So the output rows are double the length by repeating the original row.\n\nWait, but let's check another example to confirm. Example 1's input is a 4x3 matrix. Output is 4x6, each row is the original row followed by the same row again. Like first input row [3,0,0] becomes [3,0,0,3,0,0]. That fits. Similarly in Example 2, input is 4x4, output 4x8. Each row is duplicated. So the pattern is that each row in the output is the original row concatenated with itself.\n\nBut wait, let me check the third row of Example 2's output. Input row is [5,2,8,8], output is [5,2,8,8,5,2,8,8]. Yes, duplicated. The last row of Example 2's input is [0,0,6,0], output [0,0,6,0,0,0,6,0]. Wait, the original row is [0,0,6,0], so duplicating would be [0,0,6,0,0,0,6,0]. Yes, that's exactly the case. So the pattern is simply doubling each row by appending itself to the end.\n\nBut wait, let's make sure there are no exceptions. In all the training examples, the output is each input row followed by the same elements again. So the transformation is to take each row and duplicate it, doubling the length. So for the test input, each of the 5 rows should be duplicated. Let's apply that.\n\nTest input rows:\n\nFirst row: [4,0,0,0] \u2192 [4,0,0,0,4,0,0,0]\n\nSecond row: [4,5,0,0] \u2192 [4,5,0,0,4,5,0,0]\n\nThird row: [0,5,6,0] \u2192 [0,5,6,0,0,5,6,0]\n\nFourth row: [6,6,1,0] \u2192 [6,6,1,0,6,6,1,0]\n\nFifth row: [0,0,0,1] \u2192 [0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1]\n\nSo the output should be each row concatenated with itself. Let's check the examples again to make sure there isn't a different pattern. For example, maybe modifying some elements. Wait, in Example 2's last row input [0,0,6,0], the output's duplicated part is [0,0,6,0]. Wait, the input row is [0,0,6,0], so the output is [0,0,6,0,0,0,6,0]. That's exactly the same as duplicating. So no modification, just duplication.\n\nTherefore, the answer is each row doubled in length by appending itself. So the test input's output should be each row followed by itself.",

        "cot_2": "Okay, let's see here. I need to figure out the pattern that transforms the input matrices into the output matrices in the training examples. Let me look at each example one by one and see what's happening.\n\nStarting with Example 0. The input is a 3x3 matrix:\n\n[0, 5, 0]\n[5, 5, 2]\n[0, 0, 0]\n\nAnd the output is a 3x6 matrix where each row is the original row followed by the same row again. For instance, the first output row is [0,5,0,0,5,0], which is just the original [0,5,0] duplicated. The same for the second and third rows. So the output seems to be each row concatenated with itself. So the pattern here is duplicating each row's elements.\n\nChecking Example 1. The input is a 4x3 matrix:\n\n[3,0,0]\n[2,3,0]\n[2,1,8]\n[0,1,0]\n\nThe output is each row duplicated. For example, the first output row is [3,0,0,3,0,0]. Same for the others. So again, each row is doubled in length by repeating itself.\n\nExample 2 has a 4x4 input:\n\n[5,2,3,0]\n[2,5,3,0]\n[5,2,8,8]\n[0,0,6,0]\n\nThe output rows are the original rows concatenated with themselves, making each row 8 elements long. So yes, same pattern here.\n\nSo the general pattern is: Take each row of the input matrix and duplicate it, appending the same elements again. So each row's length doubles from n to 2n.\n\nNow applying this to the test input. The test input is a 5x4 matrix. Let's take each row and duplicate it. For example, the first row [4,0,0,0] becomes [4,0,0,0,4,0,0,0]. Similarly, the second row [4,5,0,0] becomes [4,5,0,0,4,5,0,0], and so on for each row.\n\nWait, but let me check if there are any exceptions or different patterns in the examples. Let's look at Example 0's third row: input [0,0,0] becomes [0,0,0,0,0,0], which is correct. Example 2's fourth row: input [0,0,6,0] becomes [0,0,6,0,0,0,6,0]. Wait, the original input is [0,0,6,0], so duplicating it would be [0,0,6,0,0,0,6,0]. But when I duplicate the original row, it's [0,0,6,0] followed by [0,0,6,0], right? Wait, but the output for that row in Example 2 is [0,0,6,0,0,0,6,0]. Wait, the original is [0,0,6,0], so duplicating would be [0,0,6,0,0,0,6,0]. Wait, no, the duplication would be the same as the original. Let's see: original is [0,0,6,0], duplicated would be [0,0,6,0,0,0,6,0]. Wait, but that's not correct. Wait, if you take [0,0,6,0] and append it to itself, it's [0,0,6,0,0,0,6,0], which is exactly the output. So that's correct. So there's no exception here. So each row is simply duplicated.\n\nTherefore, applying this to the test input. Let's process each row:\n\nTest Input:\n\nRow 1: [4,0,0,0] \u2192 [4,0,0,0,4,0,0,0]\nRow 2: [4,5,0,0] \u2192 [4,5,0,0,4,5,0,0]\nRow 3: [0,5,6,0] \u2192 [0,5,6,0,0,5,6,0]\nRow 4: [6,6,1,0] \u2192 [6,6,1,0,6,6,1,0]\nRow 5: [0,0,0,1] \u2192 [0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1]\n\nSo each row is duplicated. The output matrix should have the same number of rows as the input, each with doubled elements by repeating the original row. That seems to be the pattern."
