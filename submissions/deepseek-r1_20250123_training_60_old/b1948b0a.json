        "cot_1": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. So, the task is to look at the training examples and find out how the input lists are transformed into the output lists. Then apply that same transformation to the test input.\n\nLooking at Example 0:\n\nInput has three lists. The first input list is [6,6,7,6], and the output is [2,2,7,2]. Hmm. So, the 6s became 2s except for the 7 which stayed the same? Wait, but the third element was 7 and it stayed 7. Then in the output, the 6s are replaced with 2s. Let me check the other lists in Example 0.\n\nSecond input list is [6,6,7,7], output [2,2,7,7]. So same here: 6\u21922, 7 remains. Third input list is [7,7,6,7], output [7,7,2,7]. Again, 6\u21922, 7 stays. So the pattern seems to be replacing all 6s with 2s and leaving 7s as they are. Wait, but let's check the other examples to confirm.\n\nLooking at Example 1:\n\nFirst input list [7,7,7,6] \u2192 output [7,7,7,2]. So again 6\u21922. Second input [6,6,7,6] becomes [2,2,7,2]. So same as before. Third input [7,7,6,7] \u2192 [7,7,2,7]. Yes, same pattern. All 6s become 2s, 7s stay. So maybe that's the rule. But wait, let's check Example 2.\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput first list [7,7,6,6,6,6] \u2192 output [7,7,2,2,2,2]. Again 6\u21922. Second input [6,7,6,7,7,7] becomes [2,7,2,7,7,7]. Third input [7,6,7,7,6,7] \u2192 [7,2,7,7,2,7]. All 6s become 2s. So the transformation is indeed replacing every occurrence of 6 with 2 and keeping 7s unchanged.\n\nWait, but why then in some outputs there are 7s and 2s? Like in Example 0's output, the third list is [7,7,2,7]. Because the original had a 6 in the third position. So yes, it's simply replacing 6s with 2s. So the rule is: For each element in the input list, if it's a 6, change it to 2. Leave 7s as they are.\n\nTesting this with the test input. The test input lists are:\n\n[6,7,7,6] \u2192 should become [2,7,7,2]\n\n[6,7,6,7] \u2192 [2,7,2,7]\n\n[7,7,7,6] \u2192 [7,7,7,2]\n\n[7,6,7,6] \u2192 [7,2,7,2]\n\nSo the output should be four lists with 6s replaced by 2s and 7s unchanged.",

        "cot_2": "Okay, let's look at these examples and try to figure out the pattern. So, the input is a list of lists of numbers, and the output is another list of lists where some numbers are changed. Let's start with Example 0.\n\nIn Example 0's input, the first row is [6,6,7,6], and the output is [2,2,7,2]. I notice that the 6s turned into 2s, except where there's a 7. Wait, but the third element in the input row is 7, which stays as 7 in the output. So maybe all 6s are replaced with 2s, but 7s remain the same. Let me check the other rows. The second input row is [6,6,7,7], output [2,2,7,7]. Yep, same thing: 6\u21922, 7 stays. Third input row [7,7,6,7] becomes [7,7,2,7]. Again, replacing 6s with 2s. So maybe the rule is: replace every 6 with 2, leave 7s as is. But wait, why in the first example of the output, the third element is 7 (original 7) but the others are 6\u21922. That seems to fit.\n\nLooking at Example 1's input. The first input row is [7,7,7,6], output [7,7,7,2]. Again, replacing the 6 with 2. The second input row is [6,6,7,6] \u2192 [2,2,7,2]. So same pattern. So the rule here is replace all 6s with 2s, and leave 7s untouched. But wait, in Example 2, the input has 6s and 7s again. Let's check. The first input row is [7,7,6,6,6,6], output is [7,7,2,2,2,2]. Yes, replacing all 6s with 2s. So the pattern seems straightforward: replace every occurrence of 6 with 2, leave 7s as is. But wait, wait. Let me check all examples again to confirm.\n\nIn Example 0's output, all 6s are replaced by 2s. The 7s remain. Similarly, Example 1's outputs follow the same. Example 2's outputs also follow. So the transformation is simply replacing 6 with 2, 7 stays. Then why in the test input would the output be the same as replacing 6s with 2s?\n\nWait, the test input is:\n\n[6,7,7,6]\n[6,7,6,7]\n[7,7,7,6]\n[7,6,7,6]\n\nApplying the rule of replacing 6 with 2, the outputs would be:\n\n[2,7,7,2]\n[2,7,2,7]\n[7,7,7,2]\n[7,2,7,2]\n\nWhich is exactly what the expected answer should be. So that's the pattern. Let me cross-verify with the examples again. All 6s become 2s, 7s stay. So yes, this seems to hold. So the answer for the test input is each 6 becomes a 2, 7 remains 7."
