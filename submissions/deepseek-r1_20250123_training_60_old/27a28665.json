        "cot_1": "Okay, let's try to figure out this pattern. So, we have these input matrices and their corresponding outputs. The goal is to find the rule that transforms the input into the output number. Let's go through each example step by step.\n\nStarting with Example 0:\nInput:\n[5,5,0]\n[5,0,5]\n[0,5,0]\nOutput: [1]\nHmm, what's special here? Let me visualize the matrix. The first row is 5,5,0. Second row 5,0,5. Third row 0,5,0. Maybe looking for symmetry? Like, maybe the number of symmetric elements or something. Alternatively, maybe the count of certain numbers arranged in a pattern.\n\nExample 1:\nInput:\n[8,0,8]\n[0,8,0]\n[8,0,8]\nOutput: [2]\nThis matrix looks like a diamond pattern perhaps. The 8s form a diamond shape. The output is 2. So maybe the number of diamond shapes or layers?\n\nExample 2:\nInput:\n[5,0,5]\n[0,5,0]\n[5,0,5]\nOutput: [2]\nSame as Example 1's structure but with 5s. So maybe the same diamond pattern here. So the count is 2 again. Wait, but how does that relate to the output?\n\nWait, looking at Example 3 and 4. Example3's input is:\n[0,1,1]\n[0,1,1]\n[1,0,0]\nOutput:3. So perhaps the number of connected regions or something. But how? Let's see. The matrix here has three 1s in the top two rows on the right, and the third row starts with a 1 and then zeros. Maybe the count is based on the number of connected regions in the matrix if we consider non-zero elements. But in Example3, maybe there are three separate regions: the two 1s in the first row (but they are adjacent), the two 1s in the second row, and the single 1 in the third row. But that would be two regions maybe. Not sure.\n\nWait, maybe it's the number of times a certain pattern occurs. Alternatively, maybe the sum of certain positions. Let's check Example6. Input:\n[0,5,0]\n[5,5,5]\n[0,5,0]\nOutput:6. The matrix here looks like a cross. The center is 5, and the surrounding are 5s forming a cross. The output is 6. Hmm, maybe the sum of the cross elements. Let's see: the middle row has three 5s, and the middle column (excluding the center which is already counted). Wait, the cross here would be the middle row (sum 5+5+5=15) and the middle column (0+5+5+0=10?), but that doesn't add up to 6. Alternatively, maybe the count of elements in the cross. The cross here has 5 elements (the middle row and middle column, overlapping at the center). But 5 elements would sum to 5*5=25, but output is 6. So that might not be it.\n\nWait, Example6's output is 6, and the matrix has 5s. Let's count the number of 5s. The first row has one 5, second row three 5s, third row one. So total 5. But output is 6. So that's not it. Hmm.\n\nAnother approach: looking at the outputs. The outputs are 1,2,2,3,3,1,6. Let's see if there's a pattern related to the positions of non-zero elements.\n\nLooking at Example0 and Example5. Both have output 1. Their matrices:\n\nExample0:\n5 5 0\n5 0 5\n0 5 0\n\nExample5:\n4 4 0\n4 0 4\n0 4 0\n\nThey have similar structures. Maybe the output is 1 when there's a certain pattern. Let's see if these form a 'T' shape or something. Wait, in Example0, the first row is 5,5,0. The first column is 5,5,0. The second row is 5,0,5. Maybe it's a star-like shape, but not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the number of distinct elements that form a symmetrical pattern. But in Example0, all non-zero are 5s. So output is 1. In Example1, all non-zero are 8s, output is 2. Wait, that doesn't align. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps the output is the number of times the non-zero elements form a certain figure. Let's consider Example1 and 2, which have outputs of 2. The matrices have a diamond pattern. But how does that count to 2? Maybe the diamond is made of two overlapping shapes, like two diamonds. Or perhaps the number of concentric diamonds. But in Example1, it's a single diamond made of 8s. So why output 2?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output counts the number of times the non-zero elements form a plus sign. For example, in Example6, the plus (cross) is made of 5 elements. The output is 6. Wait, 5 elements, output 6. Not sure.\n\nWait, maybe the output is related to the sum of the digits. For example, in Example6, the sum is 0+5+0 +5+5+5 +0+5+0 = 25. 25's digits sum to 7. Output is 6. Doesn't match. Maybe not.\n\nLooking at Example3 and 4, both have output 3. Their matrices:\n\nExample3:\n0,1,1\n0,1,1\n1,0,0\n\nExample4:\n0,8,8\n0,8,8\n8,0,0\n\nSame structure with different numbers. The output is 3. How to get 3 from these. Let's count the number of 1s (or 8s) in each. Example3: 5 1s. Example4:5 8s. Output is 3. So 5 elements but output 3. Not directly.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the number of \"corners\" or certain positions where non-zero elements are present. Let's see:\n\nIn Example3, the non-zero elements are in positions (0,1), (0,2), (1,1), (1,2), (2,0). So arranged such that maybe three separate regions. Wait, but how?\n\nAlternatively, think of the matrix as a 3x3 grid. Maybe the output is the number of times a certain cell is a \"center\" of a pattern. Or perhaps the output is the count of certain patterns, like the number of \"L\" shapes, or other.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the count of distinct horizontal, vertical, or diagonal lines that have the same elements. For example, in Example1, each row is [8,0,8], [0,8,0], [8,0,8]. The first and third rows are same, the second is different. Columns: first column is 8,0,8; second column 0,8,0; third 8,0,8. So vertical lines same as rows. Diagonals: maybe. But how does that lead to output 2?\n\nAnother approach: Let's look at the positions where non-zero elements are present. For example:\n\nExample0's non-zero positions are (0,0), (0,1), (1,0), (1,2), (2,1). If we plot these on a 3x3 grid:\n\nX X 0\nX 0 X\n0 X 0\n\nThis forms a sort of 'X' pattern but maybe a different structure. The output is 1.\n\nExample1's non-zero positions form a diamond. All edges except the center. So (0,0), (0,2), (1,1), (2,0), (2,2). Wait, no. Example1's matrix is:\n\n8,0,8\n0,8,0\n8,0,8\n\nSo non-zero at (0,0), (0,2), (1,1), (2,0), (2,2). So those form a diamond shape. The output here is 2. Hmm. How does that diamond count to 2?\n\nWait, maybe the number of overlapping diamonds or layers. Like, the diamond has two layers. Or perhaps the number of times the same diamond is repeated. But in this matrix, it's just one diamond. So maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the count of non-zero elements divided by some number. Example1 has 5 non-zero elements. 5 divided by 2.5 gives 2. But that's not a pattern. Example0 has 5 non-zero elements, output 1. 5/5=1. Example1:5 non-zero, output 2. 5/2.5=2. That seems arbitrary.\n\nWait, Example6's input:\n\n0,5,0\n\n5,5,5\n\n0,5,0\n\nNon-zero positions: (0,1), (1,0), (1,1), (1,2), (2,1). That's 5 elements, output 6. So 5 elements, output 6. So that's not directly related.\n\nAlternative idea: Maybe the output is the number of times the pattern appears in the matrix. For example, in Example6, the cross (middle row and middle column) might have a value based on the sum or something else.\n\nWait, the cross in Example6: middle row has 5,5,5 (sum 15), middle column has 5,5,5 (sum 15). But output is 6. So maybe 15 - 15 =0? Not helpful.\n\nAnother thought: the output might be the number of \"arms\" in a cross. Like, a cross has four arms (up, down, left, right) and the center. But in Example6, the cross is formed by the middle row and middle column. So each arm is length 1. So total arms: 4 (each direction) plus the center. But how does that get to 6?\n\nWait, maybe the sum of the positions. For Example6, the cross elements are (0,1), (1,0), (1,1), (1,2), (2,1). The sum of their coordinates:\n\n0+1 +1+0 +1+1 +1+2 +2+1 = (1)+(1)+(2)+(3)+(3) = 10. Not 6.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the sum of the elements. Example6's elements sum to 5*5 =25. But output is 6. Hmm.\n\nWait, let's think of the output as the number of \"loops\" or enclosed areas in the digits. Like, how the number 8 has two loops. But in the examples, the numbers used are 5,8, etc. But Example0 has all 5s. 5 has no loops. 8 has two. So maybe the output is counting the number of loops in the digits used multiplied by the count of those digits. But Example1's matrix is filled with 8s. Each 8 has two loops. There are 5 8s. 5*2=10. Output is 2. Doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is the count of 8-shaped figures. But in Example1, the pattern is a diamond made of 8s. Each 8 contributes two loops, but the output is 2, which could be 5 8s (5*2=10) but no. Maybe not.\n\nLet me try a different approach. Let's compare the outputs and see if there's a pattern.\n\nExample0: output 1\n\nExample1:2\n\nExample2:2\n\nExample3:3\n\nExample4:3\n\nExample5:1\n\nExample6:6\n\nLooking at the outputs, 1,2,2,3,3,1,6. So 1 occurs in examples where the matrix has a certain pattern, 2 when another pattern, etc. The test input is:\n\n[0,8,0]\n\n[8,8,8]\n\n[0,8,0]\n\nWhich looks similar to Example6. Let's compare:\n\nExample6's input:\n\n[0,5,0]\n\n[5,5,5]\n\n[0,5,0]\n\nOutput is 6. The test input is the same structure but with 8s. So maybe the output is the same as Example6. But wait, the test input's output would then be 6. But let's check the pattern again.\n\nWait, in Example6, the cross (middle row and middle column) is filled with 5s. The output is 6. How does that connect? Maybe the sum of the cross elements? For Example6, sum is 0+5+0 +5+5+5 +0+5+0 = (5) + (15) +5 =25. But output is 6. Not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the sum of the cross elements minus something. 25 minus 19 equals 6. Not helpful.\n\nWait, perhaps the output is the count of the non-zero elements in the cross. For Example6, the cross is the middle row and middle column. The non-zero elements are 5 in total. But output is 6. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe the output is related to the shape of the pattern. For example, in Example6, the cross has 5 elements arranged as a plus sign. The number 5 in a plus shape. But output is 6. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is the sum of the positions (coordinates) of the non-zero elements. For Example6:\n\nPositions are (0,1), (1,0), (1,1), (1,2), (2,1).\n\nSum of rows: 0+1+1+1+2 =5\n\nSum of columns:1+0+1+2+1=5\n\nTotal sum 5+5=10. Output is 6. No.\n\nWait, maybe the product of rows and columns sum. 5 *5=25. No.\n\nAlternative idea: Let's look at the numbers in the matrix. For Example6, all are 5s. Output is 6. 5 +1=6. For Example1 and 2, the numbers are 8 and 5. Output is 2. 8's loop count is 2, 5's is 0. But output is 2. Hmm. Not matching.\n\nWait, maybe the output is the sum of all elements in the matrix divided by some factor. Example6's sum is 5*5 =25. 25/4.166=6. Not exactly. 25 divided by 4 is 6.25, rounded down to 6. But in Example1, sum is 8*5=40. 40/20=2. So 40 divided by 20 gives 2. That seems arbitrary. Not sure.\n\nAnother angle: Look at the positions of non-zero elements and see if they form certain geometric figures, then count the number of such figures.\n\nExample0's non-zero positions form a sort of X shape but not exactly. Let's see:\n\nRows:\n\nRow0: 5,5,0 (positions 0,0 and 0,1)\n\nRow1:5,0,5 (0,0 and 0,2)\n\nRow2:0,5,0 (1,1)\n\nSo the non-zero elements are arranged as:\n\nRow0: left and middle.\n\nRow1: left and right.\n\nRow2: middle.\n\nThis seems like a diagonal cross but missing some parts. Maybe this forms a certain pattern that's counted as 1.\n\nExample1's non-zero elements are at (0,0), (0,2), (1,1), (2,0), (2,2). This is a diamond shape. The output is 2. Maybe this diamond is considered as two concentric layers? Like, the center (1,1) is the first layer, and the surrounding four points form the second. So two layers, output 2.\n\nBut then Example2 has the same structure as Example1, output 2, which fits.\n\nExample3's non-zero elements are:\n\nRow0: (1,1), (1,2)\n\nRow1: (1,1), (1,2)\n\nRow2: (0,0)\n\nSo in rows:\n\n0,1,1\n\n0,1,1\n\n1,0,0\n\nThe non-zero positions form three separate regions: the two in row0 and row1 (connected vertically?), and the single in row2. So three regions, output 3. That would explain Example3 and 4 (same structure with 8s), output 3.\n\nExample6's output is 6. Let's see: the cross has five elements. Maybe the number of elements multiplied by something. 5 * 1.2 =6. Not helpful.\n\nWait, Example6's non-zero elements are in a cross shape, and output is 6. Maybe the cross has a certain value. For example, each arm of the cross contributes to the output. The cross has four arms (up, down, left, right) and a center. If each arm has length 1, then total arms plus center is 5, but output is 6. Not sure.\n\nAlternative idea: The output is the number of adjacent pairs of non-zero elements. For Example6:\n\nThe cross has the center (1,1) connected to four directions. Each adjacent pair (center to up, down, left, right). So 4 pairs. But output is 6. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe the adjacency count. Each non-zero element is adjacent to others. The cross has five elements. Each element in the center (1,1) is adjacent to four others (up, down, left, right). The others (0,1), (1,0), (1,2), (2,1) each are adjacent to two elements. So total adjacencies: 4 (for center) + 2*4=8, but divided by 2 since each adjacency is counted twice. So (4 +4*2)/2= (4+8)/2=6. That gives 6. Which matches Example6's output. Oh, this might be the pattern!\n\nLet's test this hypothesis on other examples.\n\nTake Example0:\n\nNon-zero positions: (0,0), (0,1), (1,0), (1,2), (2,1). Let's count adjacent pairs.\n\nAdjacencies:\n\n(0,0) is adjacent to (0,1) and (1,0). So 2.\n\n(0,1) is adjacent to (0,0) and (1,1) but (1,1) is zero. So only 1.\n\nWait, no. Wait, in the matrix for Example0:\n\nRow0: [5,5,0]\n\nRow1: [5,0,5]\n\nRow2: [0,5,0]\n\nSo (0,0) is adjacent to (0,1) (same row) and (1,0) (below). Both non-zero. So 2 adjacencies.\n\n(0,1) is adjacent to (0,0) (non-zero), (1,1) (zero), (0,2) (zero). So 1 adjacency.\n\n(1,0) is adjacent to (0,0) (non-zero), (1,1) (zero), (2,0) (zero). So 1 adjacency.\n\n(1,2) is adjacent to (1,1) (zero), (0,2) (zero), (2,2) (zero), and (1,2) is connected to (2,2) which is zero. So maybe no adjacencies.\n\n(2,1) is adjacent to (1,1) (zero), (2,0) (zero), (2,2) (zero), and (1,1) is zero. So no adjacencies except (1,1) which is zero. So only (2,1) has no non-zero neighbors.\n\nSo total adjacencies:\n\nEach adjacency is counted once (since we can check each non-zero element's neighbors).\n\nFor (0,0): 2 (0,1 and 1,0)\n\nFor (0,1):1 (0,0)\n\nFor (1,0):1 (0,0)\n\nFor (1,2):0\n\nFor (2,1):0\n\nTotal: 2+1+1=4. But since each adjacency is counted twice (once for each element involved), the actual number of edges is 4/2=2. But the output here is 1. Hmm. So this doesn't fit.\n\nHmm, maybe the hypothesis is wrong.\n\nWait, in Example6:\n\nNon-zero elements are (0,1), (1,0), (1,1), (1,2), (2,1).\n\nAdjacency count:\n\n(0,1) is adjacent to (1,1) (non-zero) and (0,0) (zero), (0,2) (zero). So 1 adjacency.\n\n(1,0) is adjacent to (1,1) and (0,0) (zero), (2,0) (zero). So 1 adjacency.\n\n(1,1) is adjacent to (0,1), (1,0), (1,2), (2,1) \u2014 all four are non-zero. So 4 adjacencies.\n\n(1,2) is adjacent to (1,1) and (0,2) (zero), (2,2) (zero). So 1 adjacency.\n\n(2,1) is adjacent to (1,1) and (2,0) (zero), (2,2) (zero). So 1 adjacency.\n\nTotal adjacencies per element:\n\n(0,1):1\n\n(1,0):1\n\n(1,1):4\n\n(1,2):1\n\n(2,1):1\n\nTotal: 1+1+4+1+1=8. Since each adjacency is counted twice, actual edges are 8/2=4. But the output is 6, so this doesn't fit.\n\nHmm, maybe the hypothesis is incorrect.\n\nAlternative approach: Let's think of the output as the number of times the same pattern appears in the matrix. For example, in Example6, the cross is a single pattern, but the output is 6. Not sure.\n\nWait, let's look at the test input:\n\n[0,8,0]\n\n[8,8,8]\n\n[0,8,0]\n\nThis is the same structure as Example6's input. So if the output for Example6 is 6, maybe the test input's output is also 6. But why? Because the pattern is the same, but the number is 8 instead of 5. But in Example1 and 2, the numbers change from 8 to 5, but the output remains the same (2). So the output depends on the structure, not the values. So the test input's output should be the same as Example6's output, which is 6. So the answer would be [6].\n\nWait, but let's check this. Test input:\n\nNon-zero elements are in positions (0,1), (1,0), (1,1), (1,2), (2,1). Same as Example6. So the structure is identical, just using 8s instead of 5s. Since the output for Example6 is 6, then the test input should also output 6.",

        "cot_2": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. So, we have these input matrices and their corresponding outputs. Let's look at each example and see if there's a common rule.\n\nStarting with Example 0:\nInput:\n[5, 5, 0]\n[5, 0, 5]\n[0, 5, 0]\nOutput: [1]\nHmm. Maybe the output is related to the number of certain patterns in the matrix. Let's check the other examples.\n\nExample 1:\nInput:\n[8, 0, 8]\n[0, 8, 0]\n[8, 0, 8]\nOutput: [2]\nThis matrix looks like it has a sort of symmetry. The first and third rows are [8,0,8], and the middle row is [0,8,0]. Maybe it's forming an 'X' shape or something. Wait, the output here is 2. Example 0's output was 1. How are they different?\n\nExample 2:\nInput:\n[5, 0, 5]\n[0, 5, 0]\n[5, 0, 5]\nOutput: [2]\nThis is similar to Example 1, just with 5s instead of 8s. The output is the same, 2. So maybe the number 2 corresponds to a certain symmetrical pattern.\n\nLooking at Example 3:\nInput:\n[0, 1, 1]\n[0, 1, 1]\n[1, 0, 0]\nOutput: [3]\nThis one is a bit different. The first two rows have 0 in the first position, then 1s. The third row starts with 1, then 0s. Maybe the count here is related to the number of times a particular number appears in a certain position. Or perhaps the number of rows that match a certain condition.\n\nExample 4:\nInput:\n[0, 8, 8]\n[0, 8, 8]\n[8, 0, 0]\nOutput: [3]\nThis looks similar to Example 3 but with 8s. The structure is the same: first two rows start with 0, then 8s, third row starts with 8 and 0s. So their outputs are both 3. Maybe the output is 3 when there's a certain vertical or horizontal arrangement.\n\nExample 5:\nInput:\n[4,4,0]\n[4,0,4]\n[0,4,0]\nOutput: [1]\nThis is similar to Example 0. The structure here has the first row as [4,4,0], second [4,0,4], third [0,4,0]. The output is 1 again. So maybe the count is based on how many times a certain pattern repeats in the matrix.\n\nExample 6:\nInput:\n[0,5,0]\n[5,5,5]\n[0,5,0]\nOutput: [6]\nThis one is different. The middle row is all 5s, and the first and third rows have 5s in the middle. It forms a cross shape. The output is 6. That's a higher number. Maybe the sum of certain elements? Let's check.\n\nWait, the middle row in Example 6 is [5,5,5], sum is 15. The other rows have two 5s each, so total sum is 15 + 5 +5 = 25. But output is 6, which doesn't match. Maybe not sum.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the count of non-zero elements in the middle row and column? Let's check:\n\nFor Example 6:\nMiddle row (second row) has three 5s. Middle column (second column) has 5 in all three rows. So non-zero elements in middle row:3, middle column:3. But 3+3=6, which matches the output 6. Let's test this hypothesis.\n\nTesting with Example 0:\nInput matrix:\nRow 0:5,5,0\nRow1:5,0,5\nRow2:0,5,0\nMiddle row (row1) has 5,0,5 \u2192 two non-zero elements (positions 0 and 2).\nMiddle column (column1) elements:5 (row0),0 (row1),5 (row2) \u2192 two non-zero (5 and5). So total is 2+2=4. But output is 1. Hmm, that doesn't fit. So maybe that's not the pattern.\n\nAlternative approach: Maybe the output is the number of times a certain element appears in the middle row or column. Wait, in Example 6, the middle row is all 5s. So three 5s. Middle column has three 5s. But output is 6. Maybe 3+3=6. That could work. Let's check other examples.\n\nExample 1:\nMiddle row is [0,8,0]. Non-zero elements: 1 (the 8 in column1). Middle column: 8 (row0),8 (row1),0 (row2) \u2192 two 8s. So 1+2=3. But output is 2. Doesn't match. So that's not it.\n\nWait, maybe the output is the count of the number of lines (rows or columns) that are symmetrical or have a certain pattern. Let's see.\n\nLooking at Example 0:\nRows:\nRow0:5,5,0\nRow1:5,0,5\nRow2:0,5,0\nIf we check for symmetry in each row. Row1 is symmetric (5,0,5). The columns: Column0 is 5,5,0. Not symmetric. Column1:5,0,5. Also symmetric? Column1 is 5,0,5 \u2192 which is symmetric. Column2:0,5,0 \u2192 symmetric. So how many symmetric columns? Columns 1 and 2. So two columns. Symmetric rows: row1. So total 3? But output is 1. Not matching.\n\nAlternative idea: Maybe the output is the number of \"islands\" or connected regions of non-zero values. For example, in Example 0:\n\nThe matrix is:\n5 5 0\n5 0 5\n0 5 0\n\nVisualizing this, the 5s might form a cross? Or maybe separate regions. Let's see. The top-left 5 is connected to the 5 below (row1, col0), which connects to row2, col1. But perhaps it's a single connected region. Maybe the output counts connected regions. But Example 0's output is 1. Let's check Example 1.\n\nExample1:\n8 0 8\n0 8 0\n8 0 8\n\nHere, the 8s form an X shape. Are they connected? Diagonally connected maybe. If diagonals count as connected, then it's one region, but the output is 2. Hmm, that contradicts.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's the number of times a specific element is surrounded by zeros. But not sure.\n\nAnother approach: Looking at the outputs, they are 1,2,2,3,3,1,6. Let's see if there's a pattern related to the number of non-zero elements in certain positions.\n\nWait, in Example6, the output is 6. The matrix is:\n0,5,0\n5,5,5\n0,5,0\n\nThe non-zero elements are: row0 has one 5, row1 has three 5s, row2 has one 5. Total 5 non-zero elements. But output is 6. So that's not directly related.\n\nAlternatively, the sum of the positions. For example, in Example6, the positions (0,1), (1,0), (1,1), (1,2), (2,1). Summing their coordinates? Not sure.\n\nLet me think again. Maybe the output is the count of elements in the middle row plus the middle column. For Example6, middle row (row1) has 3 elements (5,5,5), middle column (column1) has 3 elements (5,5,5). 3+3=6. That fits. Let's check other examples.\n\nExample0:\n\nMiddle row: [5,0,5] \u2192 two non-zero elements (5 and5). Middle column: [5,0,5] \u2192 two non-zero elements. 2+2=4. Output is 1. Doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. So that's not it.\n\nAlternative idea: Maybe the output is the number of times the same number appears in the middle row and middle column. For Example6, middle row is all 5s, middle column is all 5s. So count is 3 (from row) +3 (from column) =6. That matches output 6.\n\nFor Example0:\n\nMiddle row is [5,0,5]. So two 5s. Middle column [5,0,5], two 5s. 2+2=4. But output is 1. Not matching.\n\nWait, maybe the count is the number of elements that are the same as the middle element. Let's see.\n\nExample6's middle element is 5 (row1, column1). The middle row has three 5s. The middle column has three 5s. So total 3 +3 -1 (since the middle is counted twice) \u2192 5. Not 6. Doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, the sum of the middle row and middle column. Middle row sum in Example6 is 15, middle column sum is 15. 15+15=30. Not 6. Not helpful.\n\nAnother thought: The output could be the count of the middle element (the center of the matrix) in the entire matrix. For Example0, the center is 0 (row1, column1). How many zeros are there in the matrix? Let's see:\n\nExample0's matrix:\n5,5,0\n5,0,5\n0,5,0\n\nTotal zeros: 5 (positions (0,2), (1,1), (2,0), (2,2)). But output is 1. So that's not it.\n\nWait, maybe the output is the number of non-zero elements in the middle row plus the middle column. Example6: 3 (row) +3 (column) =6. Output is 6. Example1's middle row is [0,8,0], which has one 8. Middle column is [0,8,0] (rows 0,1,2 in column1). So 1 (from row) +1 (from column) =2. Output is 2. That fits! Let's check this for other examples.\n\nExample1's output is 2. As per above calculation, 1+1=2. Correct.\n\nExample2: matrix is:\n\n[5,0,5]\n\n[0,5,0]\n\n[5,0,5]\n\nMiddle row: [0,5,0] \u2192 one 5. Middle column: [0,5,0] \u2192 one 5. So 1+1=2. Output is 2. Correct.\n\nExample3:\n\n[0,1,1]\n\n[0,1,1]\n\n[1,0,0]\n\nMiddle row: [0,1,1] \u2192 two 1s. Middle column: column1:1,1,0 \u2192 two 1s. So 2+2=4. But output is 3. Hmm, this doesn't fit. Wait, maybe it's the count of non-zero elements in the middle row and middle column. Let's recount.\n\nExample3:\n\nMiddle row: [0,1,1] \u2192 two non-zero (1,1).\n\nMiddle column (column1): [1,1,0] \u2192 two non-zero.\n\nTotal 2+2=4, but output is 3. So that's a problem.\n\nWait, perhaps the middle row and middle column's non-zero elements are counted, but if they overlap (i.e., the center element is counted only once). Let's see.\n\nIn Example3, the middle element (row1, column1) is 1. Middle row has two 1s (columns1 and2). Middle column has two 1s (rows0 and1). The overlapping element is the center (row1, column1) which is counted in both. So total would be 2+2 -1=3. Which matches the output 3.\n\nAh, so the pattern could be: the number of non-zero elements in the middle row plus the number in the middle column, minus one if the center element is counted in both (since it's the intersection). So total is (middle row non-zero) + (middle column non-zero) - (1 if the center is non-zero, else 0).\n\nLet's test this hypothesis across all examples.\n\nExample0:\n\nMiddle row (row1): [5,0,5] \u2192 two non-zero.\n\nMiddle column (column1): [5,0,5] \u2192 two non-zero.\n\nCenter element (row1, col1) is 0. So no overlap. So total is 2+2=4. But output is 1. So this doesn't fit. Hmm.\n\nWait, that doesn't work. So this hypothesis is invalid.\n\nAlternative approach: Let's look for another pattern.\n\nLooking at the examples where output is 3:\n\nExamples3 and4. Let's see their matrices.\n\nExample3:\n\nInput:\n0 1 1\n\n0 1 1\n\n1 0 0\n\nMiddle row: [0,1,1]. Middle column: [1,1,0]. Non-zero counts in middle row:2, middle column:2. So 2+2=4. Output is3. How?\n\nWait, maybe the count is the number of non-zero elements in the entire matrix that are in either the middle row or middle column. Let's calculate:\n\nFor Example3:\n\nMiddle row elements: columns0 (0),1 (1),2 (1). So non-zero: 2 elements (positions1 and2).\n\nMiddle column elements: rows0 (1),1 (1),2 (0). So non-zero: 2 elements (rows0 and1).\n\nBut the union would be 2 (row) + 2 (column) - overlap. The overlap is the element at row1, column1 (which is 1). So union count is 2+2-1=3. Which matches the output 3.\n\nAh! So the pattern is: count the number of non-zero elements in the middle row plus the number in the middle column, then subtract 1 if they overlap (since the center element is counted in both). So the formula is (middle_row_non_zero + middle_col_non_zero) - (1 if center is non-zero else 0).\n\nLet's test this with all examples.\n\nExample0:\n\nMiddle row (row1) non-zero: 5,5 \u2192 2.\n\nMiddle column (col1) non-zero: 5 (row0),5 (row2) \u2192 2.\n\nCenter element (row1, col1) is 0. So no overlap. So total is 2+2=4. But output is 1. Hmm, this doesn't fit. So this can't be the pattern.\n\nWait, maybe I'm missing something here. Let's check other examples.\n\nExample1:\n\nMiddle row non-zero: 8 (col1) \u2192 1.\n\nMiddle column non-zero: 8 (row0, col1), 8 (row1, col1), 8 (row2, col1) \u2192 Wait, no. Wait the matrix for Example1 is:\n\nRow0:8,0,8\n\nRow1:0,8,0\n\nRow2:8,0,8\n\nMiddle column (col1): elements are 0 (row0),8 (row1),0 (row2). So non-zero in middle column: 1 (row1's 8).\n\nSo middle row (row1) has 1 non-zero, middle column has 1 non-zero. Center element (row1, col1) is 8 (non-zero). So total is 1+1 -1 =1. But output is 2. So this contradicts.\n\nHmm, this approach isn't working.\n\nAlternative idea: Let's look at the outputs and see if they relate to the number of times a certain pattern occurs. For example, in Example0 and Example5, the output is 1. Let's look at their matrices.\n\nExample0's matrix:\n\n5 5 0\n\n5 0 5\n\n0 5 0\n\nIf we look for the number of \"crosses\" or specific shapes. Maybe the output is the number of times the number appears in a cross pattern. Like, the center is surrounded by four elements. Not sure.\n\nAnother thought: Maybe the output is the number of occurrences where a row or column is a palindrome. For example, a row is the same forwards and backwards.\n\nExample0's rows:\n\nRow0:5,5,0 \u2192 not a palindrome.\n\nRow1:5,0,5 \u2192 is a palindrome.\n\nRow2:0,5,0 \u2192 is a palindrome.\n\nColumns:\n\nCol0:5,5,0 \u2192 not palindrome.\n\nCol1:5,0,5 \u2192 palindrome.\n\nCol2:0,5,0 \u2192 palindrome.\n\nSo in Example0, there are 2 palindromic rows and 2 palindromic columns. Total 4. Output is 1. Doesn't fit.\n\nExample1's rows:\n\nRow0:8,0,8 \u2192 palindrome.\n\nRow1:0,8,0 \u2192 palindrome.\n\nRow2:8,0,8 \u2192 palindrome.\n\nColumns:\n\nCol0:8,0,8 \u2192 palindrome.\n\nCol1:0,8,0 \u2192 palindrome.\n\nCol2:8,0,8 \u2192 palindrome.\n\nTotal 3 rows and 3 columns \u2192 6 palindromes. Output is 2. Doesn't fit.\n\nNot helpful.\n\nLet me think differently. Let's look for the output numbers and see if they relate to the positions of the non-zero elements.\n\nExample0's output is 1. Maybe the count is the number of non-zero elements in the outer ring of the matrix.\n\nBut the matrix is 3x3. The outer ring is all elements except the center. Example0's outer elements:\n\nRow0:5,5,0\n\nRow1:5 (col0), 5 (col2)\n\nRow2:0,5,0\n\nNon-zero outer elements: 5,5,5,5,5 \u2192 total 5. Output is 1. Doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the number of distinct non-zero elements. Example0 has only 5. So 1, which matches the output. Example1 has 8, so output 2. But that doesn't fit. Example3 has 1 and 0. But output is3. So that's not it.\n\nAnother angle: Let's look at the sum of the middle row and middle column. Example0's middle row sum:5+0+5=10. Middle column sum:5+0+5=10. 10+10=20. Output is 1. No connection.\n\nExample6's middle row sum is 15, middle column sum is15. 30. Output is6. 30/5=6. Not sure.\n\nWait, maybe the output is the sum of the middle row and middle column divided by 5. For Example6: (15+15)/5=6. Yes. Let's test other examples.\n\nExample1's middle row sum:0+8+0=8. Middle column sum:0+8+0=8. 8+8=16. 16/8=2. Which matches output 2. Example1's output is2.\n\nExample2's middle row sum:0+5+0=5. Middle column sum:0+5+0=5. 5+5=10. 10/5=2. Output is2. Fits.\n\nExample3's middle row sum:0+1+1=2. Middle column sum:1+1+0=2. 2+2=4. 4/ something. Output is3. Doesn't fit.\n\nExample0's sum:5+0+5=10 (row), 5+0+5=10 (column). Total 20. 20/20=1. Output is1. Oh, that fits. So output is (middle row sum + middle column sum) divided by 20 for Example0. But Example1's sum is 8+8=16 \u2192 16/8=2. So the divisor varies. This isn't consistent.\n\nHmm. Maybe it's (sum of middle row and middle column) divided by the value of the center element. For Example0, center is 0. Can't divide by zero. So that's out.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the sum of the middle row and middle column, then take the digit sum. Example0's sum is 20 \u2192 2+0=2. Output is1. No. Example6's sum is30 \u21923+0=3. Output is6. Doesn't fit.\n\nThis is getting frustrating. Let's think of another approach.\n\nLooking at Example6's output is6. The middle row is all 5s, sum 15. The middle column also all 5s, sum15. The product of their sums is15*15=225. No connection.\n\nWait, maybe the output is the count of the non-zero elements in the middle row and column. For Example6, middle row has 3, column has3. Total 6. Which matches output6.\n\nExample1's middle row has1, column has1. Total2. Output2. Correct.\n\nExample0's middle row has2, column2. Total4. Output1. Doesn't fit.\n\nWait, but in Example0, the middle row is [5,0,5] (two non-zero), middle column [5,0,5] (two non-zero). Total4. Output1. So why is it 1?\n\nAh, perhaps the output is the minimum of the non-zero counts in middle row and column. For Example0, min(2,2)=2. Output is1. No.\n\nAlternatively, the maximum. Example0:2. Output1. No.\n\nExample3: middle row non-zero count2, column2. Output3. So no.\n\nAlternative idea: Maybe the output is the number of times the middle element appears in the entire matrix. For Example6, the middle element is5. How many 5s are there? Let's see:\n\nExample6's matrix:\n\n0,5,0\n\n5,5,5\n\n0,5,0\n\nThere are 5 5s. Output6. Doesn't match.\n\nWait, but maybe the count includes the middle row and column. For Example6, middle row has3, middle column has3. 3+3=6. Output6. Fits. \n\nBut for Example0:\n\nMiddle row has2, column2. 2+2=4. Output1. Doesn't fit. \n\nBut Example3's middle row has2, column2. 2+2=4. Output3. So that's not it.\n\nWait, but in Example3, the middle element is1. The middle row has two 1s, and the middle column has two 1s. So maybe the count is the sum of the middle row and column's non-zero elements, minus the center element (since it's counted in both). So 2+2-1=3. Which matches output3.\n\nExample0: middle row non-zero count2, column2. But center element is0. So sum is2+2=4. Output1. So this still doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. Let's think of the examples where output is1: Example0 and5.\n\nExample0's matrix:\n\n[5,5,0]\n\n[5,0,5]\n\n[0,5,0]\n\nIf I look for the number of 5s in the entire matrix: row0 has two, row1 has two, row2 has one. Total5. Output1. No connection.\n\nExample5:\n\nInput:\n[4,4,0]\n\n[4,0,4]\n\n[0,4,0]\n\nNon-zero elements: row0: two 4s, row1: two 4s, row2: one 4. Total5. Output1. So maybe 5/5=1. But Example6's output is6. No.\n\nAnother approach: Let's look for the number of \"islands\" of non-zero elements connected horizontally or vertically. \n\nIn Example0's matrix:\n\nRow0:5,5,0 \u2192 connected as a horizontal pair.\n\nRow1:5,0,5 \u2192 two separate 5s.\n\nRow2:0,5,0 \u2192 single 5.\n\nSo how many islands? The row0 pair is one. Row1's left 5 connects to row0's left 5? So it's connected. Row1's right 5 connects to row0's right 5 (but row0's right is 0). So row1's right5 is an island. Row2's 5 is connected to row1's middle 0. Not connected to any. So total islands: row0's pair and row1's left5 as one, row1's right5 as another, row2's 5 as third. So 3 islands. Output is1. Doesn't fit.\n\nThis isn't working. Maybe I'm missing a different pattern.\n\nLet's look at the test input:\n\nTest Input:\n[0,8,0]\n\n[8,8,8]\n\n[0,8,0]\n\nWhat's the output based on previous examples?\n\nThis looks similar to Example6's input, which had:\n\n[0,5,0]\n\n[5,5,5]\n\n[0,5,0]\n\nOutput for Example6 is6. So the test input's output should be6? Because the structure is the same: middle row all 8s, and middle column all 8s. But according to the pattern where the output is the count of non-zero elements in middle row and column (3+3=6), then yes. So the test output would be6.\n\nBut wait, let's check why Example6's output is6. According to our previous analysis, the middle row has three 5s, middle column has three 5s. So 3+3=6. Which matches.\n\nSimilarly, the test input's middle row is three 8s (non-zero), middle column (col1) has three 8s. So sum is3+3=6. Output should be6. But let's check if there's any example that would contradict this.\n\nExample0's output was1, which according to this pattern would require middle row and column counts sum to1. But in Example0, middle row has two non-zero, column two. Sum4. So this contradicts. So why is Example0's output1?\n\nAh, perhaps the pattern is different. Wait, maybe the output is the number of times the middle row and column have the same number as the center.\n\nExample0: center is0. Middle row:5,0,5 \u2192 non-zero elements are5 and5. Middle column:5,0,5. So the non-zero elements in middle row and column are 5s. But the center is0. So maybe it's counting how many times the non-zero elements in the middle row and column are the same as the center. But since center is0, and non-zero elements are5, the count is0. But output is1. Doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is the count of the number of non-zero elements in the entire matrix that are the same as the center element. If center is0, then count of zeros. Example0's center is0. The matrix has 5 zeros. Output is1. Doesn't fit.\n\nThis is really challenging. Let's try to re-express the examples in terms of middle row and column.\n\nLooking back at the examples where output is the sum of middle row and column non-zero elements:\n\nExample1: sum 1+1=2 \u2192 output2.\n\nExample2: sum1+1=2 \u2192 output2.\n\nExample3: sum2+2=4 \u2192 output3. Not matching.\n\nExample6: sum3+3=6 \u2192 output6.\n\nTest input: sum3+3=6 \u2192 output6.\n\nBut Example0: sum2+2=4 \u2192 output1.\n\nThis suggests that the pattern holds for some examples but not all. So maybe there's another factor.\n\nWait, perhaps the output is the count of non-zero elements in the middle row and column multiplied by a factor based on the value of the elements. For example, if the non-zero elements are all the same as the center.\n\nWait, in Example6, the center is5. All non-zero elements in middle row and column are5. So (3+3)=6 \u2192 output6.\n\nExample1's center is8. All non-zero elements in middle row and column are8. So 1+1=2 \u2192 output2.\n\nExample2's center is5. Middle row and column elements are5. So 1+1=2 \u2192 output2.\n\nExample3's center is1. Middle row has two1s, middle column has two1s. So 2+2=4. But output is3. So why?\n\nWait, the non-zero elements in the middle row and column of Example3 are all 1s. So according to the pattern, output should be4, but it's3.\n\nAh, maybe the overlapping element (the center) is counted once, not twice. So in Example3, middle row has two 1s (columns1 and2), middle column has two 1s (rows0 and1). But the center (row1, column1) is counted in both. So total is 2 + 2 -1=3. Which matches the output3.\n\nSimilarly, in Example0, middle row has two 5s, middle column has two5s. The center is0, so no overlap. So total 2+2=4. But output is1. So this doesn't fit. So why?\n\nWait, perhaps the overlapping element is the only one considered. For example, if the non-zero elements in the middle row and column are the same as the center, then subtract 1. But in Example0, the center is0, so the non-zero elements are5s. So no overlap. So sum is4. But output is1. So that doesn't help.\n\nAnother angle: Let's look at Example0 and5, which have output1.\n\nExample0's matrix:\n\n5 5 0\n\n5 0 5\n\n0 5 0\n\nThe middle row and column have two non-zero each, but output1. So maybe the output is the number of 'loops' or something else.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the number of times a certain number appears in the four corners. For Example0, corners are5,0,0,0. So one5. Output1. Example5's corners are4,0,0,0 \u2192 one4. Output1. Example1's corners are8,8,8,8. So four8s. Output2. Doesn't fit.\n\nExample6's corners are0,0,0,0 \u2192 zero. Output6. So no.\n\nHmm. I'm stuck. Let's think about the test input again. It's:\n\n[0,8,0]\n\n[8,8,8]\n\n[0,8,0]\n\nThis is similar to Example6's input, which had middle row all non-zero and middle column all non-zero, leading to output6. So applying that pattern, the test output would be6. But why does Example0 have output1?\n\nWait, maybe the output is the number of non-zero elements in the middle row multiplied by the number of non-zero elements in the middle column. \n\nExample0:2 *2=4 \u2192 output1. No.\n\nExample6:3*3=9 \u2192 output6. Doesn't fit.\n\nExample1:1*1=1 \u2192 output2. No.\n\nNot helpful.\n\nAlternative idea: The output is the number of non-zero elements in the entire matrix that are in the middle row or middle column.\n\nFor Example0: middle row has2, middle column has2. Overlap is0. So total4. Output1. No.\n\nExample1: middle row1, column1. Total2. Output2. Fits.\n\nExample3: middle row2, column2. Overlap1. So 2+2-1=3. Output3. Fits.\n\nExample6:3+3-1=5. Output6. Doesn't fit.\n\nTest input:3+3-1=5. But expected output is6. So this doesn't work.\n\nWait, maybe it's the sum of non-zero elements in middle row and column. \n\nExample6's middle row sum15, column sum15. Total30. Output6. 30/5=6.\n\nExample1's sum8+8=16 \u2192 16/8=2. Fits.\n\nExample0's sum10+10=20 \u2192 20/20=1. Fits.\n\nExample3's sum2+2=4 \u2192 4/ (4/3) \u2192 output3. Not sure. But 4/1.333=3.\n\nExample5's input:\n\n[4,4,0]\n\n[4,0,4]\n\n[0,4,0]\n\nMiddle row:4,0,4. Sum8. Middle column:4,0,4. Sum8. 8+8=16. Output1. 16/16=1. Fits.\n\nExample2:\n\nMiddle row sum0+5+0=5. Column sum0+5+0=5. Total10. 10/5=2. Fits.\n\nExample4:\n\nInput:\n\n[0,8,8]\n\n[0,8,8]\n\n[8,0,0]\n\nMiddle row:0,8,8. Sum16. Middle column:8,8,0. Sum16. 16+16=32. 32/ (32/3) = ~10.666. Output is3. Doesn't fit.\n\nWait, this approach works for some examples but not all. For Example4, the sum of middle row and column is16+16=32. Output3. So 32 divided by something equals3? 32/10.666... Not helpful.\n\nSo this pattern works for Examples0,1,2,5,6 but not 3 and4. \n\nBut the test input's sum would be (8+8+8) + (8+8+8) =24+24=48. 48/8=6. Which matches the output6. But this doesn't apply to Example3 and4.\n\nHmm. Maybe for Examples3 and4, the pattern is different.\n\nExample3's input:\n\n0 1 1\n\n0 1 1\n\n1 0 0\n\nMiddle row sum0+1+1=2. Middle column sum1+1+0=2. Total4. Output3. Not matching.\n\nExample4's input:\n\n0 8 8\n\n0 8 8\n\n8 0 0\n\nMiddle row sum0+8+8=16. Middle column sum8+8+0=16. Total32. Output3. So 32/10.666=3. Doesn't fit.\n\nBut perhaps there's a different approach for even and odd sums. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the sum of the middle row and middle column, divided by the center element. For Example6: sum15+15=30. Center is5. 30/5=6. Fits.\n\nExample1: sum8+8=16. Center8. 16/8=2. Fits.\n\nExample0: sum10+10=20. Center0. Division by zero. But output is1. So no.\n\nExample3: sum2+2=4. Center1. 4/1=4. Output3. Doesn't fit.\n\nExample4: sum16+16=32. Center8. 32/8=4. Output3. No.\n\nThis only works for some examples.\n\nBut for the test input, sum of middle row (8+8+8=24) and middle column (8+8+8=24) is48. Center element8. 48/8=6. Which matches the expected output6. So this could be the pattern for the test case. But why doesn't it work for all examples?\n\nPerhaps there's a different pattern when the center is zero versus non-zero. Let's see:\n\nWhen center is zero (Example0):\n\nSum of middle row and column:10+10=20. Output1. How? 20 divided by something else. Maybe the sum of all elements in the matrix. Example0's total sum is5+5+0 +5+0+5 +0+5+0=25. 20/25=0.8. Not 1.\n\nAlternatively, the number of non-zero elements in the entire matrix. Example0 has5 non-zero elements. 20/5=4. Output1.\n\nNo.\n\nThis is really tough. Maybe the key is to look for a different pattern altogether.\n\nLooking at Example6's output of6, which is the highest among the examples. Its matrix forms a cross pattern. The middle row and column are all non-zero. The other elements are non-zero only in the middle column and row. So the output could be the number of non-zero elements in the cross (middle row and column), excluding overlaps. In Example6, that's 3 (row) +3 (column) -1 (center) =5. But output is6. Doesn't fit.\n\nWait, but in Example6, the cross includes the entire middle row and column. So 3+3=6 elements, but the center is counted once. So total5. But output is6. Doesn't match.\n\nAnother thought: Perhaps the output is the sum of the middle element and the number of non-zero elements in the middle row and column. For Example6, center is5. Non-zero in row3, column3. 5 +3+3=11. No. Output6.\n\nNot helpful.\n\nAfter struggling with this, I think the most plausible pattern is that the output is the sum of the non-zero elements in the middle row and middle column. This works for Examples1,2,6, and the test input, but not others. However, given that the test input structure is similar to Example6, which follows this pattern, the output should be6."

        "cot_1": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. So, the task is to look at these input matrices and see how they map to the output numbers. Let's start by examining each example one by one.\n\nLooking at Example 0:\nInput is a 3x3 matrix:\n[5,5,0]\n[5,0,5]\n[0,5,0]\nOutput is [1]. Hmm, what's special here? Let me visualize the matrix. The first row has two 5s and a 0. The second row starts with 5, then 0, then 5. The third row has 0,5,0. Maybe looking at symmetry or the positions of zeros and non-zeros.\n\nIn Example 1:\nInput:\n[8,0,8]\n[0,8,0]\n[8,0,8]\nOutput is [2]. This matrix looks symmetric. The first and third rows are the same, and the middle row has 0 in the middle. Maybe the number 2 relates to the number of certain patterns. Like maybe there are two 'rings' or something?\n\nExample 2:\nInput is:\n[5,0,5]\n[0,5,0]\n[5,0,5]\nOutput is [2]. This looks similar to Example 1. The matrix is symmetric both vertically and horizontally. The non-zero elements form an 'X' shape maybe. So maybe the count of such X patterns? But then why output 2 here?\n\nWait, in Example 0, the output was 1. Let's compare. Example 0's matrix might form a different pattern. Maybe the number of circles or loops? Wait, the numbers are 5, 8, etc. Oh, wait, in digital displays, numbers like 8 have two loops, 5 has some segments... Wait, but the inputs are matrices, not numbers. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is the number of times the same number appears in a certain pattern. Let's check.\n\nIn Example 0, the 5s are arranged in a way that maybe forms a specific shape. Let me count the non-zero elements. Row 1: 2, row 2: 2, row 3:1. Total 5 non-zeros. Not sure. Alternatively, maybe the number of times the non-zero elements form a cross or a diamond.\n\nLooking at Example 6:\nInput:\n[0,5,0]\n[5,5,5]\n[0,5,0]\nOutput is [6]. This looks like a vertical line down the middle (the center column is all 5s except the first and last in the middle row). Wait, but middle row is all 5s. Wait, the middle row is [5,5,5], so maybe a horizontal line with vertical additions. But how does that lead to output 6?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the sum of the numbers in a certain pattern. For example, in Example 6, maybe summing all elements: 0+5+0 +5+5+5 +0+5+0 = 25. But output is 6. Doesn't match. So that's probably not it.\n\nAnother approach: maybe the output is the count of some structure. For example, the number of \"islands\" or connected regions. Let's see. In Example 0:\n\nRows:\n5 5 0\n5 0 5\n0 5 0\n\nIf we consider non-zero elements as part of a region, connected horizontally or vertically. Let's see:\n\nFirst row: two 5s connected. Second row: 5 at (2,1) is connected to (1,1), which is part of the first row's two 5s. Then in (2,3), 5. Then (3,2) is 5. So connecting (2,3) and (3,2) would form a diagonal, but in standard island counting, diagonals don't count. So maybe regions are connected only up, down, left, right. So in Example 0, how many regions?\n\nFirst row: 5 and 5 connected. Second row's 5 (position 2,1) is connected to the first row's first 5. Then the 5 in (2,3) is isolated. Then the 5 in (3,2) is connected to which? Maybe only the 5 in (2,3) if they are adjacent? No. (2,3) is rightmost in row 2. (3,2) is middle of row 3. So adjacent vertically? No. So the regions would be: the left part (positions (1,1), (1,2), (2,1)), the (2,3), and (3,2). So three regions. But output is 1. So that doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. Maybe another approach. Let's look at the outputs. The outputs are 1,2,3,6. Example 6's output is 6, which is the same as the middle element's value (5 in that case, but output is 6). Wait, in Example 6's input, the middle row is [5,5,5], and the output is 6. Wait, 5 and 6 are not the same, but perhaps the sum of the middle row? 5+5+5=15, not 6. Not matching.\n\nAlternatively, the output could relate to the count of a certain number. For example, in Example 0, how many 5s are there? Let's count:\n\nRow 1: 2, row 2: 2, row 3:1. Total 5. Output is 1. So that's not it.\n\nWait, looking at Example 3 and 4. Both output 3. Let's see their inputs.\n\nExample3:\nInput:\n[0,1,1]\n[0,1,1]\n[1,0,0]\n\nOutput [3]. Let's count the number of 1s. Row1: 2, row2:2, row3:1. Total 5. So output 3, not 5. Hmm. Maybe the number of rows with certain properties. For example, in Example3, the first two rows start with 0 and have 1s in the other positions. Third row is different. Maybe how?\n\nAlternatively, looking for the number of times a certain pattern appears. Like, in Example0, maybe the number of \"cross\" patterns. For example, a cross has a center and arms. But in Example0, the center is 0. So maybe not.\n\nWait, perhaps the output is related to the number of \"holes\" in the numbers. For example, 8 has two holes, 0 has one, but in the input, the numbers in the matrix are 5,8, etc. But in the test input, the numbers are 7. Let's check the examples where the numbers are 8. Example1: the matrix is filled with 8s in certain positions, output 2. Example4: the matrix has 8s, output 3. So if 8 represents a number with two holes, maybe the output is the sum of holes? But how?\n\nWait, in Example1, input is 8s arranged in a cross-like pattern. Maybe each 8 contributes 2 holes, but maybe the count of 8s multiplied by 2. But in Example1, how many 8s? Let's count:\n\nRow1: two 8s, row2: one 8, row3: two 8s. Total 5 8s. 5*2=10. Output is 2. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the number of 'rings' formed by the numbers. For example, Example1's matrix has a structure that forms two concentric rings. But I'm not sure.\n\nAnother idea: maybe the output is the number of times the same value appears in a diamond pattern. For instance, in Example0, the 5s form a diamond shape. Let's see:\n\nRow1: 5,5,0 \u2192 perhaps the first two elements. Row2:5,0,5. Row3:0,5,0. If you imagine the positions, maybe this forms a diamond where the center is 0. Wait, perhaps the number of layers. For example, a diamond with layers. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the count of the number of \"rotational symmetries\". For example, Example1 and 2 have output 2, which might correspond to the matrix being symmetric in two ways (like 180 degrees rotation). But Example0's output is 1. Let's check:\n\nExample0's matrix:\n\n5 5 0\n\n5 0 5\n\n0 5 0\n\nIf we rotate it 180 degrees, the original matrix would become:\n\n0 5 0\n\n5 0 5\n\n0 5 5 \u2192 which is not the same as the original. So maybe not.\n\nWait, another approach: look at the non-zero elements and see if they form a specific figure that represents a number. For example, in Example6's input:\n\n0 5 0\n\n5 5 5\n\n0 5 0\n\nThe non-zero elements form a sort of 'T' shape. Maybe that's the number 6 in some way. But how? Or maybe the shape of the non-zero elements resembles the digit in the output. For instance, the output is 6, and the non-zero elements form a shape that looks like a 6. Let's see:\n\nIn Example6, the non-zero elements are in the middle row (all three) and the middle column (second row's middle is 5, and first and third rows' middle is 5). Wait, no. The first row is 0,5,0; middle row is 5,5,5; third row is 0,5,0. So the shape is a cross: vertical line (middle column) and horizontal line (middle row). So combining them forms a plus sign. But how does that relate to the output 6? Maybe that's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the sum of the positions of the non-zero elements. But that seems complicated.\n\nWait, looking at the outputs again: 1,2,2,3,3,1,6. The outputs 1,2,3,6. These numbers are all factors of 6. Maybe the output is related to the number of distinct elements or something else.\n\nAnother angle: Maybe the output is the number of distinct rows or columns that meet a certain condition.\n\nIn Example0, the rows are [5,5,0], [5,0,5], [0,5,0]. The first and third rows are different. The middle row is unique. So that doesn't seem to help.\n\nWait, let's look for a pattern in how the output relates to the input structure.\n\nExamples with output 1: Example0 and Example5. Let's look at their inputs.\n\nExample0 input:\n\n5 5 0\n\n5 0 5\n\n0 5 0\n\nExample5 input:\n\n4 4 0\n\n4 0 4\n\n0 4 0\n\nThese look similar in structure. The non-zero elements are arranged in a way that if you mirror the matrix, perhaps the count of something is 1. Maybe the number of 'arms' or something. Alternatively, the number of \"L\" shapes. But how?\n\nWait, maybe the output is the count of the number of times the center element (middle of the matrix) is 0. Let's check.\n\nIn Example0, the center (2,2) is 0. Output is 1. Example1, the center is 8. Output is 2. Example2, center is 5. Output is 2. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAnother idea: Maybe the output is the number of diagonal lines of the same number. For instance, in Example1, the main diagonals (top-left to bottom-right and top-right to bottom-left) are all 8s. So two diagonals. Output is 2. That fits. Let's check other examples.\n\nExample0: diagonals:\n\nTop-left to bottom-right: 5,0,0 \u2192 not all same. Top-right to bottom-left: 0,0,0 \u2192 all same (zeros). But output is 1. Hmm. So maybe one diagonal? But the main diagonal (5,0,0) and anti-diagonal (0,0,0). So if the anti-diagonal is all zeros (non-zero?), but in Example0, the output is 1. So maybe count the number of diagonals (both main and anti) that have all non-zero elements. But in Example0, anti-diagonal has zeros, so not. Hmm, this is confusing.\n\nWait, in Example1, the main diagonal is 8,8,8. The anti-diagonal is 8,8,8. So both diagonals are all 8s. Output is 2. That matches. In Example2, the main diagonal is 5,5,5 (since the matrix is [5,0,5], [0,5,0], [5,0,5] \u2192 main diagonal is 5 (1,1), 5 (2,2),5 (3,3). Anti-diagonal is 5 (1,3),5 (2,2),5 (3,1). So both diagonals are all 5s. Output is 2. That fits. So maybe the output is the number of diagonals (main and anti) that are all non-zero. Let's test other examples.\n\nExample3's input:\n\n0,1,1\n\n0,1,1\n\n1,0,0\n\nMain diagonal: 0 (1,1),1 (2,2),0 (3,3). Not all non-zero.\n\nAnti-diagonal: 1 (1,3),1 (2,2),1 (3,1). Wait, (3,1) is 1. So anti-diagonal is 1,1,1 \u2192 all non-zero. So that's one diagonal. Output is 3. So this doesn't fit. So the pattern isn't that.\n\nHmm. Maybe another approach. Let's think about the output as the sum of the number of non-zero elements in the first and third rows minus something. For example, in Example0, first row has 2 non-zero, third row has 1. Sum is 3. Output is 1. Not sure.\n\nWait, looking at Example6:\n\nInput:\n\n0,5,0\n\n5,5,5\n\n0,5,0\n\nThe non-zero elements form a cross (middle row and middle column). Output is 6. The middle element is 5, but output is 6. Maybe the sum of the middle row and middle column. Middle row sum is 15 (5+5+5), middle column is 5+5+5=15. 15+15=30. No, output is 6.\n\nAlternatively, count the number of non-zero elements in the cross. Middle row has 3, middle column has 3. But overlapping at the center. Total 3+3-1=5. Output is 6. No.\n\nWait, maybe the output is the number of corners that are non-zero. For Example0, the corners are 5 (top-left), 0 (top-right), 0 (bottom-left), 0 (bottom-right). Only one corner non-zero. Output is 1. That fits.\n\nExample1:\n\nCorners are 8 (top-left), 8 (top-right), 8 (bottom-left), 8 (bottom-right). All four corners are non-zero. Output is 2. Doesn't fit. Wait, that's four corners, but output is 2. So maybe not.\n\nExample2: corners are 5 (top-left),5 (top-right),5 (bottom-left),5 (bottom-right). All four. Output is 2. So that doesn't fit either.\n\nHmm. Maybe the number of corners that are zero. Example0 has three zeros in corners. Output 1. Doesn't fit.\n\nAnother idea: Let's look for the number of times the same number appears in the four corners. Example0: corners are 5,0,0,0 \u2192 only one 5. Output is 1. Example1: all corners 8. So four 8s. Output is 2. Example2: all corners 5. Output is 2. Example3: corners are 0,1,1,0. So two 1s. Output is 3. Hmm, not matching. Example4: corners are 0,8,8,0. Two 8s. Output is3. So no pattern.\n\nWait, let's think about the examples where output is 3. Examples3 and4. Let's look at their inputs.\n\nExample3 input:\n\n0,1,1\n\n0,1,1\n\n1,0,0\n\nCorners: 0 (top-left),1 (top-right),1 (bottom-left),0 (bottom-right). So two 1s. Output is3. Not sure.\n\nAnother approach: Let's think about the output as the number of \"steps\" in a staircase pattern. For example, in Example3's input:\n\nFirst row: 0,1,1\n\nSecond row:0,1,1\n\nThird row:1,0,0\n\nThis looks like a staircase going down on the left. Maybe the number of steps. But there are two steps (from row3 to row2, row2 to row1? Not sure. Output is3. Not matching.\n\nAlternative idea: Maybe the output is the count of distinct numbers in the matrix. But in Example0, all are 5 and 0. Two distinct numbers. Output is1. No.\n\nAlternatively, the count of numbers that are equal to the center element. In Example0, center is 0. There are four 5s and five 0s. Output is1. Not related.\n\nHmm. This is tricky. Let's try to find another angle. Let's look at the Test Input:\n\nTest Input:\n\n[7,7,0]\n\n[7,0,7]\n\n[0,7,0]\n\nComparing this to Example0 and Example5, which have outputs 1.\n\nExample0's input:\n\n[5,5,0]\n\n[5,0,5]\n\n[0,5,0]\n\nExample5's input:\n\n[4,4,0]\n\n[4,0,4]\n\n[0,4,0]\n\nThe structure is similar. So perhaps the output for the Test Input is also 1. But wait, the outputs for Examples0 and5 are both 1, and their matrices have a similar pattern. The Test Input's matrix has the same structure but with 7s. So maybe the output is [1].\n\nBut wait, let's check other examples. Examples1 and2 output 2. Their structures are different. Let's see:\n\nExample1:\n\n[8,0,8]\n\n[0,8,0]\n\n[8,0,8]\n\nThis forms a diamond pattern. The non-zeros are arranged in a diamond shape. Output 2.\n\nExample2:\n\n[5,0,5]\n\n[0,5,0]\n\n[5,0,5]\n\nThis also forms a diamond, but with the same number. Output is2. So maybe the diamond shape corresponds to output 2. The number of layers or rings in the diamond. Or perhaps the number of concentric layers.\n\nBut how do Examples0 and5 fit into this? Their structure is:\n\nRow1: [a, a, 0]\n\nRow2: [a,0,a]\n\nRow3: [0,a,0]\n\nWhich forms a sort of 'X' shape but with a missing center. The output here is 1. While Examples1 and2 have a full diamond (with the center filled), output 2. So maybe the output is the number of concentric layers. For example, in Example0's X-shaped pattern (without center), maybe one layer. In Examples1 and2's filled center, two layers. So how?\n\nAlternatively, in Example0, the X shape is made of two lines crossing at the center (but the center is 0). So maybe the number of arms? Or lines. In Example0, there are four arms (up, down, left, right), but since the center is 0, perhaps each arm is a single element. So four arms. But output is1. That doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, the output could be the count of how many times the same number appears in the matrix in a cross pattern. But I'm not sure.\n\nWait, another thought: the output might be the number of occurrences where a number is surrounded by zeros in a particular way. For example, in Example0, the center is 0, surrounded by 5s. Maybe the count of such 0s. But in Example0, the center is 0 and output is1. But in Example1, the center is8, so no. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the number of 2x2 submatrices that sum to a certain value. For example, in Example0, the possible 2x2 submatrices:\n\nTop-left 2x2: [5,5;5,0] sum 15.\n\nTop-middle: [5,0;0,5] sum 10.\n\nMiddle-left: [5,0;0,5] sum 10.\n\nMiddle-middle: [0,5;5,0] sum 10.\n\nBut output is1. Not sure.\n\nThis is getting frustrating. Let me try to see if there's a different approach. Let's list all the examples and their outputs and see if I can find a pattern:\n\nEx0: Output1\n\nEx1: Output2\n\nEx2: Output2\n\nEx3: Output3\n\nEx4: Output3\n\nEx5: Output1\n\nEx6: Output6\n\nLooking at Ex6: Output6's input has the middle row as all 5s and the middle column as all 5s. So maybe the output is the sum of the middle element (5) plus the number of such elements. Wait, middle element is5. But output is6. 5+1=6. Or maybe the middle element multiplied by something. 5*1.2=6. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the middle element is5, and the output is6. 5+1=6. Maybe adding 1. But why?\n\nAnother observation: Ex6's output is6, which is the sum of all the non-zero elements divided by 5: 9 non-zero elements (each 5): 5*9=45. 45/ something. No.\n\nWait, maybe the output is the sum of the middle row and middle column. Ex6's middle row is 5,5,5 sum 15. Middle column is5,5,5 sum15. 15+15=30. Output is6. 30/5=6. Hmm. But 5 is the value of the numbers. So maybe sum of middle row and column divided by the value of the elements. 15+15=30. 30 /5 =6. Yes. Let's check other examples.\n\nEx0: Middle row is [5,0,5] sum 10. Middle column is5,0,5 sum10. Total 20. Divided by5 (since elements are5). 20/5=4. Output is1. Doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. So that doesn't work.\n\nWait, in Ex6, the middle row is all 5s, sum 15. Middle column (excluding middle element) would be 5 and5. So sum 10. 15 +10=25. 25/5=5. Output is6. No.\n\nAlternative idea: Maybe the output is the number of T-junctions or intersections. In Ex6, the cross in the middle would form a + shape, which has one intersection. But output is6. Not helpful.\n\nBack to the drawing board. Let's look at Ex3 and Ex4. Both have output3. Their inputs:\n\nEx3:\n\n0,1,1\n\n0,1,1\n\n1,0,0\n\nEx4:\n\n0,8,8\n\n0,8,8\n\n8,0,0\n\nThese look similar except for the number used. So maybe the output is related to the structure, not the number.\n\nIn Ex3, the first two rows start with 0 and have two 1s. The third row starts with1, then 0s. The pattern here could be a staircase. Maybe the output is the number of steps. Three steps? Let's see: the first two rows have two 1s each, but the third row has one 8. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the number of rows that are the same. Ex3's first and second rows are [0,1,1]. The third row is different. So two identical rows. Output is3. Doesn't fit.\n\nWait, perhaps the output is the number of times a certain pattern repeats. For example, in Ex3, the first and second rows are the same. Third row is different. So two identical rows, but output is3. Not sure.\n\nAnother approach: Let's consider that the output could be the number of elements in the longest consecutive sequence of the same number. For example, in Ex0, the longest sequence of 5s might be 2 (like the first two elements). Output is1. Doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, the number of connected components (assuming non-zero elements are connected via edges). For Ex0, how many components:\n\nThe 5s in row1, connected to row2's first 5. Then row2's third 5 is isolated. Row3's 5 is connected to row2's third 5? No. So three components. Output is1. Doesn't fit.\n\nHmm.\n\nWait, maybe the output is the count of the number of times the same number appears in a diagonal and anti-diagonal. For example, Ex0 has the anti-diagonal as zeros. So no. Ex1 has both diagonals as 8s. So count is2. Which matches the output. Ex2 has both diagonals as5s. Output is2. Ex3: anti-diagonal is1,1,1. Main diagonal is0,1,0. So only one diagonal with all non-zero. Output is3. Doesn't fit.\n\nThis is really challenging. Let's try to see if there's a pattern in the outputs. The outputs are 1,2,2,3,3,1,6. The numbers 1,2,3,6. Notice that 6 is 3 factorial. Not sure if that helps.\n\nWait, let's think of the output as the number of \"unique\" patterns in the matrix. For example, in Ex0, the matrix is symmetric in a certain way. Maybe the output represents the number of axes of symmetry. For Ex0, it's symmetric along the vertical axis. So one axis. Output is1. Ex1 and Ex2 are symmetric along both vertical and horizontal axes. So two axes. Output is2. Ex3 and Ex4 might have three axes of symmetry. But Ex3's matrix isn't symmetric. Hmm.\n\nEx3's matrix:\n\nRow1: 0,1,1\n\nRow2:0,1,1\n\nRow3:1,0,0\n\nThis is not symmetric vertically or horizontally. So that doesn't fit. So that theory is out.\n\nAnother idea: Maybe the output is the number of zeros in the matrix. Let's check.\n\nEx0: How many zeros? Let's count:\n\nRow1:1 zero.\n\nRow2:1.\n\nRow3:2.\n\nTotal 4 zeros. Output is1. No.\n\nEx1: number of zeros? Row1:1, row2:2, row3:1. Total4. Output is2. No.\n\nNot matching.\n\nAlternative approach: Maybe the output is the sum of the elements in the first row divided by the element's value. For Ex0: first row sum 10. 10/5=2. Output is1. No.\n\nWait, maybe the output is the number of times the middle element appears in the matrix. Ex0's middle is0. Number of zeros in matrix: 4. Output is1. No.\n\nEx6's middle element is5. Number of 5s is 5. Output is6. No.\n\nThis is really tricky. Let's try to find a pattern between the test input and the examples. The test input is:\n\n[7,7,0]\n\n[7,0,7]\n\n[0,7,0]\n\nThis looks very similar to Ex0 and Ex5, which have outputs1. For example, Ex0's structure is:\n\nRow1: [a,a,0]\n\nRow2: [a,0,a]\n\nRow3: [0,a,0]\n\nWhich is exactly the structure of the test input. So if this pattern holds, the output should be1. So the answer would be [1].",

        "cot_2": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. So, the problem is to take these 3x3 grids of numbers and output a single number in a list. Let's look at the training examples to see if I can find a common rule.\n\nStarting with Example 0:\n\nInput:\n[5,5,0]\n[5,0,5]\n[0,5,0]\n\nOutput: [1]\n\nHmm. Let me visualize this grid. The first row is 5,5,0. Second row 5,0,5. Third row 0,5,0. Maybe looking for symmetry or some kind of shape. Wait, if I look at the positions of the non-zero numbers, maybe it forms a certain pattern. For example, in Example 0, the non-zero elements might form the number '1'. Like, a vertical line down the middle? Let me check. First row has two 5s, but maybe the middle column. Wait, first row has 5,5,0, so the middle is 5. Second row's middle is 0. Third row's middle is 5. So maybe a vertical line? But in that case, the middle column would be 5,0,5. But that's not exactly a straight line. Hmm, maybe another approach.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the count of some particular pattern. Like the number of times a certain shape appears. For example, looking at the first example's output is 1. Maybe it's the number of \"loops\" or enclosed areas in the grid. But how?\n\nWait, looking at Example 6:\n\nInput:\n[0,5,0]\n[5,5,5]\n[0,5,0]\n\nOutput: [6]. The grid here looks like a cross, maybe. The center is 5, surrounded by 5s in all directions. If I think of the cross, maybe the number 6 has one loop in the digit, but the output here is 6. Wait, that might not fit. Alternatively, maybe the output is the sum of some elements divided by something. But let's check the numbers.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output corresponds to the number of times a certain pattern occurs. Like, the number of \"rings\" or circles formed by the non-zero numbers. For example, in Example 0, maybe the arrangement forms a '1', which has no loops. But the output is 1. Wait, but that's conflicting.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the number of non-zero elements in certain positions. Let's count the non-zero elements in each example.\n\nExample 0: Let's count non-zero numbers. First row: 5,5,0 \u2192 2. Second row:5,0,5 \u21922. Third row:0,5,0 \u21921. Total is 2+2+1=5. Output is 1. That doesn't fit.\n\nExample 1: Input has rows [8,0,8], [0,8,0], [8,0,8]. Non-zero counts: 2,1,2 \u2192 total 5. Output is 2. So 5 vs 2, maybe not directly.\n\nAnother angle: Maybe the grid represents a digit in a 7-segment display. Let's think. For example, the number 1 in a 3x3 grid would have the middle column filled. But in Example 0, the middle column is 5,0,5. Wait, that's top and bottom middle, but middle row is 0. So perhaps not. Alternatively, maybe each grid represents a digit, and the output is which digit it is. Let's see.\n\nExample 0's output is 1. If the grid forms a '1', then maybe the middle column has non-zero elements. But in Example 0's grid, the middle column is [5,0,5], which is non-zero, zero, non-zero. That's not the standard 7-segment '1' which is usually the right two vertical lines. Maybe the pattern is different.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each row represents a binary number, and then converted to decimal. But the numbers here are 5, 8, etc., which are higher than binary digits. So that's unlikely.\n\nLooking at Example 3 and 4. Their outputs are 3. Let's see their inputs.\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput:\n[0,1,1]\n[0,1,1]\n[1,0,0]\n\nOutput: [3]\n\nLooking at this grid, the first two rows have 0s in the first column and 1s in the second and third. The third row starts with 1, then 0s. If I imagine this, the left side of the grid (first column) is 0,0,1. The middle columns have 1s. Maybe forming the number 3? How?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the number of connected regions of non-zero elements. For example, in Example 3, the non-zero elements are:\n\nRow 0: columns 1 and 2 (1s)\n\nRow 1: columns 1 and 2 (1s)\n\nRow 2: column 0 (1), others 0.\n\nSo the regions would be: the two right columns form a block (since adjacent), and the bottom left 1 is separate. So two regions. But the output is 3. Hmm, that doesn't fit.\n\nWait, maybe the count is of some other feature. Let me try to think differently.\n\nAnother approach: Let's look at the positions of non-zero elements. For example, in Example 0:\n\nPositions (0,0), (0,1), (1,0), (1,2), (2,1) have non-zero. Maybe the shape here is like the letter 'A' or something. But I'm not sure.\n\nWait, the outputs for the examples are 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 1, 6. Let's see if the numbers correspond to the number of times a certain value is present in a specific pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the number of 'islands' of non-zero numbers, where islands are connected horizontally or vertically. Let's check example 3:\n\nExample 3's input:\n\nRow 0: 0,1,1\n\nRow 1: 0,1,1\n\nRow 2: 1,0,0\n\nNon-zero elements:\n\nRow 0: (0,1), (0,2)\n\nRow 1: (1,1), (1,2)\n\nRow 2: (2,0)\n\nSo the two 1s in rows 0 and 1, columns 1 and 2 are connected (they form a 2x2 block), so that's one island. The (2,0) is another. So total 2 islands. But the output is 3. That doesn't add up. So maybe that's not the pattern.\n\nLet me look at Example 6, which outputs 6. The input is:\n\n[0,5,0]\n\n[5,5,5]\n\n[0,5,0]\n\nThis looks like a cross, with the center and the four directions (up, down, left, right). Maybe the output here is 6 because the cross has 5 elements (center and four arms), but how does that relate to 6? Or maybe the sum of the elements divided by something. Let's see: sum is 0+5+0 + 5+5+5 + 0+5+0 = 5+5+5+5+5=25. 25 divided by 5 (average 5) but output is 6. Doesn't fit.\n\nAnother angle: Maybe the output is the count of the number of times the middle element appears in the grid. For example, in Example 0, the middle element is 0. The grid has 5,5,0 in the first row. The count of 0s here: but the output is 1. Not sure.\n\nWait, let's check the outputs again. Examples 0 and 5 have output 1. Their inputs are:\n\nExample 0:\n\n[5,5,0]\n\n[5,0,5]\n\n[0,5,0]\n\nExample 5:\n\n[4,4,0]\n\n[4,0,4]\n\n[0,4,0]\n\nThese two grids have the same structure but different numbers. The output is 1 for both. So the actual values don't matter, just their positions.\n\nSimilarly, Example 1 and 2 have output 2. Let's see their grids:\n\nExample 1:\n\n[8,0,8]\n\n[0,8,0]\n\n[8,0,8]\n\nExample 2:\n\n[5,0,5]\n\n[0,5,0]\n\n[5,0,5]\n\nThey have the same pattern. The positions with non-zero are the corners and the middle. So the non-zero elements form a diamond shape? So output 2. Hmm.\n\nExamples 3 and 4 have output 3. Their grids:\n\nExample 3:\n\n[0,1,1]\n\n[0,1,1]\n\n[1,0,0]\n\nExample 4:\n\n[0,8,8]\n\n[0,8,8]\n\n[8,0,0]\n\nSame pattern. The first two rows have non-zero in columns 2 and 3 (assuming 0-based?), and the third row has non-zero in column 0. So maybe the output is based on how the non-zero elements are arranged in columns.\n\nWait, let's think of the grid as a 3x3 matrix. Maybe each row is a binary representation (if the number is non-zero, it's 1, else 0). Then, the pattern is converted into a binary number, perhaps read row-wise, column-wise, or some other way. Let's try that.\n\nTake Example 0:\n\nConvert to binary (non-zero as 1):\n\n1 1 0\n\n1 0 1\n\n0 1 0\n\nThen, maybe each row is a binary digit. For example, first row is 110 (6 in decimal), second 101 (5), third 010 (2). But how does that lead to output 1? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the sum of each row's binary value. But 6 +5 +2=13. Not 1.\n\nAnother idea: The number of enclosed areas in the grid when non-zero elements are considered as blocks. For example, a grid that forms a square (like a '0' in 7-segment) would have one enclosed area. Let's check.\n\nExample 1's grid:\n\n[8,0,8]\n\n[0,8,0]\n\n[8,0,8]\n\nIf non-zero elements are 8, this forms a diamond shape. So the diamond might enclose a single area. But the output is 2. Hmm. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the number of distinct patterns or layers. For example, in Example 0, maybe the pattern has 1 loop or something. But I'm not seeing it.\n\nWait, maybe the output corresponds to the number of distinct rows that have exactly two non-zero elements. Let's check:\n\nExample 0:\n\nRow 0: two 5s \u2192 yes.\n\nRow 1: two 5s (positions 0 and 2).\n\nRow 2: one 5.\n\nSo two rows with two non-zero elements. But the output is 1. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAnother approach: The output could be the count of certain positions where the value equals the value in the center. For example, if the center is 0, how many surrounding cells are 0. But in Example 0, center is 0, and surrounding cells (like (0,1) is 5, (1,0) is 5, etc.) So none. So output 0. But the output is 1. Doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. Let's think of the shape of non-zero elements. For example, in Example 0:\n\nPositions with non-zero:\n\nRow 0: (0,0), (0,1)\n\nRow 1: (1,0), (1,2)\n\nRow 2: (2,1)\n\nIf we connect these, perhaps it forms the letter 'S' or some other shape. But I'm not seeing it. Alternatively, maybe it's the number of 'arms' coming out of the center.\n\nAlternatively, think of each example as representing a number in a certain way. Let's look for examples with output 6. Example 6's output is 6. The grid for Example 6 is:\n\n[0,5,0]\n\n[5,5,5]\n\n[0,5,0]\n\nThis forms a cross (center and up, down, left, right). The cross shape is similar to the number 6 in some digital displays. Maybe the pattern represents the digit, and the output is that digit.\n\nWait, the cross (center plus four directions) might be the digit 5 or other, but the output is 6. Hmm. Alternatively, the cross could be part of a 6. Let me visualize a digital 6. In a 3x3 grid, a 6 would have the top row as on, middle row left and center on, bottom row all on, etc. Maybe not. Let me think:\n\nA 6 in a 3x3 grid (like seven-segment):\n\nTop: on\n\nUpper left and lower left: on\n\nMiddle: off\n\nLower right: off?\n\nNot sure. Maybe the cross is part of the 8. But output here is 6. So this approach might not be right.\n\nWait, let's think of the examples where the output is 3. Example 3's input:\n\nRow 0: 0,1,1\n\nRow 1:0,1,1\n\nRow 2:1,0,0\n\nIf we consider the non-zero elements:\n\nThe first two rows have 1s in the last two columns. The third row has a 1 in the first column. So it's like a mirrored 'L' in the first two rows and a single block in the third row. Maybe this forms the number 3. But how?\n\nAlternatively, the number of non-zero elements in each column. For Example 3:\n\nColumn 0: 0,0,1 \u2192 1\n\nColumn 1:1,1,0 \u21922\n\nColumn 2:1,1,0 \u21922\n\nSum: 1+2+2=5. Output is 3. Not matching.\n\nAnother thought: The output is the number of \"corners\" that have non-zero elements. For example, in Example 0, the non-zero corners are (0,0), (0,1), (1,0), (1,2), (2,1). Wait, but corners are (0,0), (0,2), (2,0), (2,2). So in Example 0, corners (0,0) is 5, (0,2) is 0, (2,0) is 0, (2,2) is 0. So only one corner. Output is 1. Example 1: corners (0,0)=8, (0,2)=8, (2,0)=8, (2,2)=8. So four corners. Output is 2. Doesn't fit. Hmm.\n\nWait, in Example 1, output is 2. If the number of corners with non-zero is 4, which is not 2, so that's not it.\n\nAlternative approach: Let's look for how the output numbers 1, 2, 3, 6 relate to the structure.\n\nExample 0 and 5 output 1. Their grids have a similar pattern. Let's compare:\n\nExample 0's grid:\n\nRow 0: 5,5,0\n\nRow 1:5,0,5\n\nRow 2:0,5,0\n\nSo non-zero elements are in positions (0,0), (0,1), (1,0), (1,2), (2,1). \n\nThis looks like a 'V' shape maybe. Or perhaps the outline of a diamond missing some parts. Maybe the number of intersections or lines.\n\nAlternatively, the pattern could be forming the number 1. How? Maybe the middle column, but in Example 0, the middle column is [5,0,5], which is top and bottom, but not the middle. So maybe that's two parts. But output is 1.\n\nAnother Idea: Maybe the output is the number of times the middle row and middle column have non-zero elements. For Example 0: middle row is [5,0,5], so middle column has 5,0,5. Middle row's non-zero elements are two. Middle column has two non-zero. But output is 1. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the sum of the middle row and middle column. Middle row sum in Example 0 is 5+0+5=10. Middle column sum is 5+0+5=10. Sum is 20, but output is 1. Doesn't fit.\n\nWait, let's think of each example's output as the count of some distinct pattern. For instance, in Examples 0 and 5, the output is 1. The pattern in these grids is similar. Let me visualize:\n\nExample 0's grid:\n\nRow 0: [5,5,0] \u2192 left and middle are non-zero.\n\nRow 1: [5,0,5] \u2192 left and right are non-zero.\n\nRow 2: [0,5,0] \u2192 middle is non-zero.\n\nSo the non-zero elements form a kind of 'zig-zag' pattern. Maybe this resembles the number 1. So the output is 1.\n\nExample 1 and 2 have output 2. Their grids:\n\nExample 1:\n\n[8,0,8]\n\n[0,8,0]\n\n[8,0,8]\n\nNon-zero elements are in the corners and the center. So positions (0,0), (0,2), (1,1), (2,0), (2,2). Wait, no, in example 1, the rows are:\n\nRow 0:8,0,8 \u2192 positions 0 and 2.\n\nRow 1:0,8,0 \u2192 position 1.\n\nRow 2:8,0,8 \u2192 positions 0 and 2.\n\nSo the non-zero elements form a diamond shape (corners of a diamond?), but perhaps this pattern is associated with the number 2. How?\n\nExamples 3 and 4 output 3. Their grids:\n\nExample 3:\n\nRow 0:0,1,1\n\nRow 1:0,1,1\n\nRow 2:1,0,0\n\nNon-zero elements are in the right two columns for the first two rows and left column for the third row. This might form a shape like a '3'. Like three horizontal bars? But how?\n\nExample 6's output is 6. The grid is:\n\nRow 0:0,5,0 \u2192 middle is non-zero.\n\nRow 1:5,5,5 \u2192 all three.\n\nRow 2:0,5,0 \u2192 middle.\n\nThis forms a vertical line in the middle and a horizontal line in the middle row. So a cross, which might resemble the number 6 in some way. For example, a 6 on a digital display has a loop on the top and a vertical line. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the cross has five non-zero elements. Output is 6. Not directly related.\n\nHmm. Maybe the output corresponds to the number of 'holes' in the grid when the non-zero elements are considered as filled. For example:\n\n- Example 0: The pattern has no enclosed holes, so output 0. But output is 1. Not matching.\n\n- Example 1: The diamond shape has one hole in the center (since the middle is filled). So output 1? But output is 2. Doesn't fit.\n\nAnother Idea: Maybe the output is the number of unique non-zero values present in the grid. Let's check:\n\nExample 0: All non-zero are 5 \u2192 1 unique. Output is 1. That matches.\n\nExample 1: All non-zero are 8 \u2192 1 unique. Output is 2. Doesn't match.\n\nSo that's not it.\n\nWait, Example 3 has non-zero values 1 and 1 and 1, but output is 3. So it's not the number of unique values.\n\nAlternative approach: Let's think of each grid as a certain geometric shape and count the number of lines or angles. For example, Example 0's grid forms a 'V' shape which has two lines (two arms), but output is 1. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the number of distinct 2x2 squares in the grid that have a certain property. For example, count how many 2x2 squares have all four elements non-zero. Let's check:\n\nExample 0's grid:\n\nLooking for 2x2 squares:\n\nTop-left 2x2: rows 0-1, columns 0-1.\n\nElements:\n\n5,5\n\n5,0 \u2192 has a zero. So not.\n\nTop-right 2x2: rows 0-1, columns 1-2.\n\n5,0\n\n0,5 \u2192 zeros. Not.\n\nBottom-left: rows 1-2, columns 0-1.\n\n5,0\n\n0,5 \u2192 zeros.\n\nBottom-right: rows 1-2, columns 1-2.\n\n0,5\n\n5,0 \u2192 zeros.\n\nSo none. Output is 1. Doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. Let me try another angle. Let's see the outputs and see if they can be linked to the sum modulo something. For example:\n\nExample 0's non-zero sum: 5+5 +5+5 +5 = 25. 25 modulo 10 is 5. Output is 1. No.\n\nExample 6's non-zero sum: 5 +5+5+5+5=25 \u2192 same sum as Example 0, but output is 6. So that's not it.\n\nAlternatively, sum of all elements divided by the minimum non-zero element. Example 0 sum is 25, divided by 5 is 5. Output is 1. Not.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the number of times a certain diagonal or other pattern is present.\n\nLooking at Example 0:\n\nNon-zero elements at positions (0,0), (0,1), (1,0), (1,2), (2,1). \n\nIf we draw this, it's a bit like a diagonal from (0,0) to (2,1) but not exactly. \n\nAlternatively, the number of 'peaks' in the grid. Like, in Example 0, the peak is at (0,1) and (2,1). But not sure.\n\nWait, let's look at the test input:\n\nTest Input:\n\n[7,7,0]\n\n[7,0,7]\n\n[0,7,0]\n\nThis looks very similar to Example 0 and 5. For example, Example 0:\n\n[5,5,0]\n\n[5,0,5]\n\n[0,5,0]\n\nSo same structure. The non-zero elements are in positions (0,0), (0,1), (1,0), (1,2), (2,1). So according to the training examples, the output for this pattern is 1 (as in Example 0 and 5). So applying that pattern, the test output should be [1]."

        "cot_1": "Okay, let's tackle this puzzle. I need to figure out the pattern that maps the given input matrices to their corresponding output numbers. Let's start by looking at the training examples one by one and see if I can spot any commonalities or rules.\n\nFirst, Example 0:\n\nInput is:\n[5, 5, 0]\n[5, 0, 5]\n[0, 5, 0]\n\nOutput is [1]. Hmm. Let me visualize this matrix. It's a 3x3 grid. Maybe the pattern has to do with the arrangement of numbers. Let's check other examples.\n\nExample 1:\n\nInput:\n[8, 0, 8]\n[0, 8, 0]\n[8, 0, 8]\n\nOutput [2]. Here, the 8s form an X shape. Similarly, in Example 2:\n\n[5, 0, 5]\n[0, 5, 0]\n[5, 0, 5]\n\nOutput is [2]. Again, an X pattern. So maybe when the non-zero numbers form an X, the output is 2. But wait, Example 0's output is 1. Let's look at that again. In Example 0, the matrix isn't a perfect X. The first row is [5,5,0], which doesn't form the diagonal. Maybe the number of non-zero elements in certain positions?\n\nWait, Example 0's matrix has the first row as 5,5,0. The middle row is 5,0,5. The last row is 0,5,0. Maybe this is a different pattern. Let me check the output for when it's an X. Examples 1 and 2 both have X patterns and output 2. So maybe X-shaped matrices output 2. But why does Example 0 and 5 output 1?\n\nLooking at Example 5:\n\nInput:\n[4,4,0]\n[4,0,4]\n[0,4,0]\n\nOutput [1]. This matrix doesn't form an X. Let's see. The first row has two 4s, the middle row has 4 on both ends and 0 in the middle. The last row has a 4 in the middle. Maybe it's forming a different shape. Like a T or something else. Alternatively, maybe the count of certain elements?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is based on the number of times a certain condition is met. Let's check Example 3 and 4. Example 3's input is:\n\n[0,1,1]\n[0,1,1]\n[1,0,0]\n\nOutput is [3]. The matrix here has the first two rows starting with 0, then 1s, and the third row starts with 1. Maybe the number of rows that have a certain pattern? Like, how many rows have two 1s? The first two rows have two 1s each, and the third row has one. But the output is 3. Hmm, not sure.\n\nWait, Example 3's output is 3, and Example 4 is similar but with 8s. Let's look at Example 4:\n\nInput:\n[0,8,8]\n[0,8,8]\n[8,0,0]\n\nOutput [3]. So same structure as Example 3 but with 8s. So maybe the pattern is not about the numbers themselves but their positions. Let's think of the matrix as layers. Maybe the output counts certain positions.\n\nAnother approach: Let's think of the 3x3 grid as cells (i,j) where i is the row (0 to 2) and j the column (0 to 2). Maybe the sum or arrangement in specific cells leads to the output.\n\nLooking at Example 0 again. Maybe the number of non-zero elements along the perimeter? Let's see. The perimeter includes the outer edges. For Example 0:\n\nRow 0: 5,5,0 (non-zero: 2)\nRow 1: 5,0,5 (non-zero: 2)\nRow 2: 0,5,0 (non-zero:1)\nPerimeter would be the first and last rows and first and last columns. Wait, the perimeter elements are (0,0), (0,1), (0,2), (1,0), (1,2), (2,0), (2,1), (2,2). Wait, but in a 3x3 matrix, the perimeter is all the outer cells. So total 8 cells (since 3x3 has 9 cells, the center is the only non-perimeter). So for Example 0:\n\n(0,0)=5, (0,1)=5, (0,2)=0 \u2192 2 non-zero\n(1,0)=5, (1,2)=5 \u2192 2\n(2,0)=0, (2,1)=5, (2,2)=0 \u21921 non-zero\nTotal perimeter non-zero: 2+2+1=5. But the output is 1. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the number of times a certain pattern repeats. For example, in Example 0, the middle row is [5,0,5], which might form a cross. But I'm not getting it.\n\nWait, looking at Example 6:\n\nInput:\n[0,5,0]\n[5,5,5]\n[0,5,0]\n\nOutput [6]. Here, the middle row is all 5s, and the middle column has 5s. So it's a plus sign. Maybe the output is 6 when there's a plus shape. Then Example 6's output is 6. Let's check others.\n\nExamples 1 and 2 have X shapes (output 2), Example 6 has a plus (output 6). Then maybe the output is determined by the shape formed by the non-zero elements. So X is 2, plus is 6. Then what about Examples 0 and 5? Let's see. Example 0:\n\nRow 0: 5,5,0\nRow 1:5,0,5\nRow2:0,5,0\n\nThis looks like a mix of parts of X and maybe something else. Wait, perhaps the number of corners that have non-zero? Let's check.\n\nCorners are (0,0), (0,2), (2,0), (2,2).\n\nExample 0: (0,0)=5, (0,2)=0, (2,0)=0, (2,2)=0. So 1 corner. Output is 1. Example 5's input:\n\nRow0:4,4,0 \u2192 (0,0)=4, (0,2)=0\nRow1:4,0,4 \u2192 (1,0)=4, (1,2)=4\nRow2:0,4,0 \u2192 (2,0)=0, (2,2)=0\nCorners: (0,0)=4, (2,0)=0, etc. So only (0,0) and (1,0), (1,2) have 4s. Wait, corners are (0,0), (0,2), (2,0), (2,2). In Example 5, only (0,0) is non-zero (4), (0,2) is 0, (2,0)=0, (2,2)=0. So only 1 corner. Output is 1. So maybe the output is the number of non-zero elements in the corners. But in Example 1:\n\nInput is:\n[8,0,8]\n[0,8,0]\n[8,0,8]\n\nCorners: (0,0)=8, (0,2)=8, (2,0)=8, (2,2)=8. All four corners are 8. But output is 2. So that contradicts. Because four corners would mean 4, but output is 2. So that's not the case.\n\nHmm. Let's think differently. Maybe the sum of certain elements. Let's take Example 0's output 1. If the sum of the corners is 5 (since (0,0)=5, others 0), but 5 mod something? Not sure. Example 1's sum of corners would be 8*4=32, output is 2. 3+2=5, maybe not. Or sum of digits? 3+2=5, but not sure.\n\nAlternative approach: Let's count the number of distinct rows or columns. For Example 0:\n\nRows:\n[5,5,0], [5,0,5], [0,5,0]. All different. So 3 distinct rows, output 1. Doesn't fit.\n\nExample 1's rows: [8,0,8], [0,8,0], [8,0,8]. First and third rows are same. So two distinct rows. Output is 2. Example 2's rows: [5,0,5], [0,5,0], [5,0,5]. Again, first and third same. So two distinct rows. Output 2. Example 3: rows are [0,1,1], [0,1,1], [1,0,0]. First two rows same, third different. So two distinct rows. But output is 3. Hmm, that doesn't fit.\n\nWait, maybe the number of rows that are palindromic? Let's check. A palindrome reads the same forwards and backwards.\n\nExample 0's rows:\n[5,5,0] reversed is [0,5,5] \u2192 not same.\n[5,0,5] reversed is [5,0,5] \u2192 palindrome.\n[0,5,0] reversed is same. So two palindromic rows. Output is 1. Doesn't match.\n\nExample 1's rows: [8,0,8] is palindrome. [0,8,0] is palindrome. [8,0,8] is palindrome. All three rows are palindromic. Output is 2. So that's not matching.\n\nAnother thought: maybe the output is the number of \"arms\" in the figure. Like an X has two arms (each diagonal), a plus has four arms (up, down, left, right). But then Example 6's output is 6. That doesn't align. Alternatively, maybe the count of certain elements.\n\nWait, in Example 6, the input is:\n\n[0,5,0]\n[5,5,5]\n[0,5,0]\n\nThis forms a cross or plus sign. The output is 6. Maybe the sum of the cross elements. Let's see: the cross here is the middle row (5,5,5) and the middle column (5,5,5). So total 5 elements (since the center is counted once). Sum would be 5*5=25. But output is 6. Doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the number of directions in which there are non-zero elements. For example, in the plus shape, there are four directions (up, down, left, right), but output is 6. Not matching.\n\nLet's try looking for a different pattern. Let's check the positions where the non-zero elements are present and see if their coordinates relate to the output.\n\nFor example, in Example 0:\n\nNon-zero positions:\nRow 0: (0,0)=5, (0,1)=5\nRow 1: (1,0)=5, (1,2)=5\nRow 2: (2,1)=5\n\nThe coordinates are (0,0), (0,1), (1,0), (1,2), (2,1). Let's see if these form a pattern. Maybe counting how many times a certain row or column has non-zero elements. For row 0: 2 non-zero, row 1: 2, row 2:1. Sum is 5. Output is 1. Not sure.\n\nAnother idea: the output might be the count of certain \"loops\" or enclosed areas in the digits. For example, the number 8 has two loops, 6 has one, etc. But the examples use numbers like 5,8,4, etc. Let's check if the sum of the loops in the numbers contributes. For example, in Example 1:\n\nNumbers are 8 and 0. Each 8 has two loops. How many 8s are there? Let's see:\n\nIn Example 1's input:\nRow0: 8,0,8 \u2192 two 8s\nRow1: 0,8,0 \u2192 one 8\nRow2:8,0,8 \u2192 two 8s\nTotal 5 eights. Each 8 has two loops \u2192 5*2=10. Output is 2. Not matching.\n\nBut Example 4's input uses 8s as well. Example 4's input has 8s arranged similarly to Example 3. Let's see Example 3's input:\n\n[0,1,1]\n[0,1,1]\n[1,0,0]\n\nNumbers are 0,1. 1 has no loops. Output is 3. So that approach isn't working.\n\nAlternative approach: Maybe the output is determined by the number of times a certain pattern appears in the matrix. For example, the number of 2x2 submatrices that meet a condition. Let's try Example 0:\n\nLooking for 2x2 submatrices. The matrix is:\n\nRow0: 5,5,0\n\nRow1:5,0,5\n\nRow2:0,5,0\n\nPossible 2x2 blocks:\n\nTop-left: 5,5;5,0 \u2192 sum 15\n\nNext:5,0;0,5 \u2192 sum 10\n\nBottom-left:5,0;0,5 \u2192 sum 10\n\nMiddle:0,5;5,0 \u2192 sum 10\n\nNot sure. How about the number of 2x2 blocks with even sums? Not sure. Output is 1. Hmm.\n\nLet me try looking at the output numbers and see if there's a connection. The outputs are 1,2,2,3,3,1,6. Maybe the output is the number of distinct non-zero digits in the matrix. For example, Example 0 has only 5s. So one distinct digit \u2192 output 1. Example 1 has 8s \u2192 one distinct \u2192 output 2. Wait, no. That's conflicting. Example 1's output is 2 but only has 8s. So that doesn't fit. Alternatively, maybe the count of the non-zero elements in certain positions.\n\nWait, in Example 0, how many 5s are there? Let's count:\n\nRow0: two 5s\n\nRow1: two 5s\n\nRow2: one 5\n\nTotal 5. Output is 1. Not matching.\n\nAnother idea: the output corresponds to the number of times a certain pattern of zeros and non-zeros occurs. For instance, in Example 0, the first row is [5,5,0], which could be represented as [non-zero, non-zero, zero]. Maybe the number of unique patterns across rows or columns.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is the number of diagonal lines formed by non-zero elements. For example, in Example 1, the X shape has two diagonals (main and anti), so output 2. Which matches. Example 2 also X, output 2. Example 6's plus shape has two lines (vertical and horizontal), but output is 6. Hmm. That doesn't fit.\n\nWait, but the plus shape has a vertical and horizontal line. So two lines, but output is 6. That's not matching. So maybe not that.\n\nLet me think of the output numbers. The outputs are 1,2,2,3,3,1,6. Maybe there's a pattern here. The numbers 1,2,3,6. Let's see if these numbers relate to the shapes. For instance, 6 could be the sum of 1+2+3, but not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the number of intersections of non-zero elements. For example, in an X shape, the center is where the two diagonals intersect, so one intersection. But output is 2. Doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, the number of 'arms' extending from the center. In an X, two diagonals (so four arms?), but output is 2. In a plus, four arms, output is 6. Hmm. Not matching.\n\nWait, Example 6's output is 6. The plus shape has a vertical and horizontal line through the center. If each line has three elements (the middle row and column), maybe the sum is 3 (rows) +3 (columns) =6? But output is 6. That might fit. Let's check:\n\nIn Example 6's input:\n\nMiddle row is all 5s (3 elements), and the middle column has 5s in all three positions. So two lines with 3 elements each. 3+3=6. Output is 6. That matches.\n\nIn Example 1 and 2 (X shape), each diagonal has three elements (assuming the center is counted once). So each diagonal has 3 elements. So for X, it's two diagonals \u2192 3+3=6. But the output is 2. So that doesn't fit. Hmm.\n\nWait, but in Example 1, each diagonal has three 8s. So two diagonals. So 2 lines. Output is 2. That matches. Then Example 6 has two lines (vertical and horizontal), each with 3 elements. So output is 3+3=6. So maybe the output is the sum of the number of elements in each line. Wait, but in Example 1, each diagonal has 3 elements. So 3+3=6, but output is 2. That contradicts. So that's not the case.\n\nWait, maybe the count of lines. For X, two lines (two diagonals) \u2192 output 2. For plus, two lines (vertical and horizontal) \u2192 output 2. But Example 6's output is 6. So that's not matching.\n\nAlternative idea: the output is the number of non-zero elements in the largest contiguous line. For example, in Example 6's plus, the middle row and column each have 3 elements. So 3. But output is 6. Doesn't fit.\n\nAnother approach: Let's look for the output numbers and see if they relate to the shape. For instance, output 2 for X (like the two diagonals), output 6 for plus (like the six directions? Not sure). But this is vague.\n\nLooking back at Examples 3 and 4:\n\nExample 3's input:\n\n[0,1,1]\n[0,1,1]\n[1,0,0]\n\nOutput is 3. Let's see. The matrix has non-zero elements in the first two rows (columns 1 and 2), and the third row starts with 1. Maybe the number of 'corners' filled. But not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's the number of L-shapes formed by non-zero elements. For example, in Example 3's input:\n\nRow0: [0,1,1]\nRow1: [0,1,1]\nRow2: [1,0,0]\n\nThe non-zero elements form an L-shape in the bottom-left corner (cell (2,0)), but also the top-right has two 1s. Not sure. Output is 3.\n\nAlternatively, count the number of 2x2 squares with exactly three non-zero elements. Let's check Example 3:\n\nPossible 2x2 squares:\n\nTop-left: rows 0-1, columns 0-1:\n0,1\n0,1 \u2192 two non-zeros.\n\nNext square: rows 0-1, columns 1-2:\n1,1\n1,1 \u2192 four non-zeros.\n\nNext, rows 1-2, columns 0-1:\n0,1\n1,0 \u2192 two non-zeros.\n\nRows 1-2, columns 1-2:\n1,1\n0,0 \u2192 two non-zeros.\n\nNo 2x2 squares have three non-zeros. So output is 3. Doesn't fit.\n\nAnother thought: the output could be the number of edges in the figure formed by non-zero elements. For example, in Example 0's figure, maybe it's a diamond shape with certain edges. But not sure.\n\nAlternatively, think of the matrix as a binary grid (non-zero as 1, zero as 0), and the output is the number of connected regions. For Example 0:\n\nConvert to binary:\n\n1 1 0\n1 0 1\n0 1 0\n\nThis forms a sort of cross but not exactly. Let's see. Connected regions:\n\nThe top-left 1 is connected to the middle row's left 1. The middle right 1 is connected to the middle row's right 1. The middle bottom 1 is connected to the middle row's middle 0. Wait, maybe this forms two separate regions. But output is 1. So maybe it's a single connected region. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, in Example 1's binary matrix:\n\n1 0 1\n0 1 0\n1 0 1\n\nThis is an X, which is a single connected region. Output is 2. So that approach isn't working.\n\nHmm. I'm stuck. Let's try to find another pattern. Let's see if the output is related to the number of times a certain value appears in the matrix. For example, in Example 0, there are five 5s. Output is 1. But 5 mod 4 is 1, maybe? 5 mod something. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the number of unique sums of rows or columns. Let's compute for Example 0:\n\nRows sums:\n\nRow0:5+5+0=10\n\nRow1:5+0+5=10\n\nRow2:0+5+0=5\n\nSo two unique sums (10 and 5). Output is 1. Doesn't fit.\n\nColumns sums:\n\nColumn0:5+5+0=10\n\nColumn1:5+0+5=10\n\nColumn2:0+5+0=5\n\nSame as rows. Two unique sums. Output 1. Not matching.\n\nAnother angle: the output might be related to the positions of zeros. For instance, in Example 0, the center is zero. Output is 1. Example 1's center is 8, but output is 2. So that's not it.\n\nWait, Example 6 has a plus sign, which has non-zero in the center. Output is 6. Example 0 has zero in the center. Output is 1. So maybe the presence of a non-zero center affects the output. But how?\n\nAlternatively, the output could be the sum of the positions (i+j) for non-zero elements modulo something. For Example 0, non-zero elements are at positions:\n\n(0,0), (0,1), (1,0), (1,2), (2,1).\n\nSum of i+j for each:\n\n0+0=0\n\n0+1=1\n\n1+0=1\n\n1+2=3\n\n2+1=3\n\nTotal sum =0+1+1+3+3=8. Output is 1. 8 mod 7 is 1. Maybe modulo 7? Let's check Example 1:\n\nNon-zero positions in Example1:\n\n(0,0), (0,2), (1,1), (2,0), (2,2).\n\nSum of i+j:\n\n0, 2, 2, 2, 4. Total sum: 0+2+2+2+4=10. 10 mod 7=3. Output is 2. Doesn't fit.\n\nHmm.\n\nLet me try to think of the output as the number of \"steps\" or something. For example, in Example 0, the pattern might require certain steps. But I'm not getting it.\n\nAlternative approach: Let's look for a pattern where the output corresponds to the number of times a certain pattern occurs in the matrix. For example, the number of T-shaped or L-shaped patterns.\n\nIn Example 0, perhaps there's one T-shape. But I'm not sure.\n\nWait, looking at Example 6's output of 6. The input is a plus sign, which is formed by the middle row and column. Maybe the output is the sum of the middle row and middle column. For Example 6, middle row is 5+5+5=15, middle column is 5+5+5=15. Sum is 30. But output is 6. Not directly related.\n\nAlternatively, the product of the number of elements in the middle row and column. Middle row has 3 elements, middle column has 3. 3x3=9. Output is 6. No.\n\nAnother idea: the output is the count of certain symmetries. For instance, if the matrix is symmetric along a certain axis.\n\nExample 0's matrix:\n\nRow0:5,5,0\n\nRow1:5,0,5\n\nRow2:0,5,0\n\nIs this symmetric? Let's check vertically. For vertical symmetry (mirror over the middle column), row0 would need the first and third elements to be the same. Row0:5 and 0. No. Row1:5 and 5. Yes. Row2:0 and 0. Yes. So rows 1 and 2 are symmetric, row 0 isn't. Not sure.\n\nExample1's matrix is symmetric along both diagonals, as it's an X. So it has diagonal symmetry. Output is 2. Maybe the number of symmetry axes. For X, there are two diagonals as axes. So 2. Output 2. That matches. Example2 is same as Example1's structure, so output 2. Example6's plus is symmetric along both vertical and horizontal axes. So two axes. But output is 6. Doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. I'm going in circles. Let me try to look for another pattern.\n\nLooking at the outputs again: 1,2,2,3,3,1,6. The outputs for Examples 0 and 5 are 1. Let's compare their inputs.\n\nExample0:\n\n5,5,0\n\n5,0,5\n\n0,5,0\n\nExample5:\n\n4,4,0\n\n4,0,4\n\n0,4,0\n\nThese look similar. The first row has two of the same number, the second row has the first and third elements, the third row has one element in the middle. So their structure is the same. Output is 1 for both. So perhaps the output is determined by the structure, not the numbers. So the output is based on the shape formed by the non-zero elements, regardless of the actual numbers.\n\nSo, the output would be:\n\n- 1 for a certain shape (like in Examples 0 and 5)\n\n- 2 for X shape (Examples 1,2)\n\n-3 for another shape (Examples3,4)\n\n-6 for plus shape (Example6)\n\nSo the Test Input is:\n\n[2,0,2]\n\n[0,2,0]\n\n[2,0,2]\n\nWhich is an X shape, like Examples1 and2. So the output should be 2.\n\nWait, but in the Test Input, the non-zero elements form an X. The first row is [2,0,2], middle row [0,2,0], last row [2,0,2]. This is exactly the same structure as Examples1 and2, which have output 2. So the answer should be [2].",
        "attempt_2": [
            [
                2
            ]
        ],
        "cot_2": "Okay, let's see here. I need to figure out the pattern that maps the given inputs to their outputs. Let's go through each example one by one.\n\nStarting with Example 0:\nInput is a 3x3 grid:\n[5, 5, 0]\n[5, 0, 5]\n[0, 5, 0]\nOutput is [1]. Hmm. Maybe I should look for some symmetry or count certain elements. Let's check if the number of zeros matters. But in Example 0, there are several zeros. Not sure yet.\n\nExample 1:\nInput:\n[8, 0, 8]\n[0, 8, 0]\n[8, 0, 8]\nOutput is [2]. The grid here looks symmetric. Like, maybe the pattern has something to do with the arrangement of non-zero numbers. The first and third rows have 8s at the ends and zero in the middle. The middle row has 8 in the center. Wait, that might form an 'X' shape? Because 8s are in the corners and the center. So maybe the count of such patterns?\n\nWait, Example 2's input is:\n[5, 0, 5]\n[0, 5, 0]\n[5, 0, 5]\nOutput is [2]. This looks similar to Example 1's structure. The non-zero numbers form an X. So maybe when the grid forms an X with the same numbers, the output is 2? Then why is Example 0's output 1? Let me check Example 0 again. Example 0's grid is:\nRow 0: 5,5,0\nRow 1:5,0,5\nRow 2:0,5,0\nThis doesn't form an X. Maybe the non-zero elements form a different shape. Like maybe a cross (plus sign) instead of X. Let's see. For Example 0, the middle row has 5,0,5. The first row's first two are 5,5. The middle column has 5,0,5. Maybe the cross is vertical and horizontal lines? Or maybe it's a different pattern.\n\nLooking at Example 3:\nInput:\n[0,1,1]\n[0,1,1]\n[1,0,0]\nOutput [3]. Here, the non-zero elements might form a different structure. The first two rows have 1s in the middle and right, and the third row has 1 in the left. Not sure. Maybe count the number of corners filled? For example, in Example 3, the top right and middle right have 1s, and bottom left. But how does that lead to 3?\n\nExample 4:\nInput:\n[0,8,8]\n[0,8,8]\n[8,0,0]\nOutput [3]. This seems similar to Example 3's structure. The first two rows have 8s in the middle and right, third row's first element is 8. So same pattern as Example 3 but with different numbers. So maybe the count here is 3 for this arrangement.\n\nExample 5:\nInput:\n[4,4,0]\n[4,0,4]\n[0,4,0]\nOutput [1]. This looks similar to Example 0. The first row has two 4s, the middle row starts and ends with 4, and the last row has a 4 in the middle. Maybe forming a kind of T-shape or something else.\n\nExample 6:\nInput:\n[0,5,0]\n[5,5,5]\n[0,5,0]\nOutput [6]. This looks like a plus sign. The middle row is all 5s, and the middle column is 5s. So maybe a cross here, which might correspond to 6.\n\nSo trying to find the pattern. Let's see:\n\nLooking at the outputs. The possible outputs are 1,2,3,6. Maybe the output corresponds to the number of lines (rows, columns, diagonals) that are all non-zero? Or perhaps the number of certain patterns.\n\nAlternatively, think of the grids as binary (non-zero vs zero). Let's convert each example to binary (1 for non-zero, 0 for zero) and see if that helps.\n\nExample 0 binary:\n1 1 0\n1 0 1\n0 1 0\nOutput 1. Maybe the number of certain shapes here. For instance, how many corners are filled. But in Example 0, top-left, top-middle, middle-left, middle-right, bottom-middle are 1s. Not sure.\n\nAnother approach: The output could be the number of times a certain pattern repeats. For example, in Example 1, the X shape (corners and center) is present, and output is 2. But how?\n\nWait, looking at the outputs for Examples 1 and 2, both have X patterns and output 2. Example 0 and 5 have output 1, perhaps a different pattern. Examples 3 and 4 have output 3, and Example 6 has 6.\n\nWait, in Example 6's input, after converting to binary:\n\n0 1 0\n1 1 1\n0 1 0\n\nThis is a plus sign. The output is 6. Maybe the sum of the cross's directions (like up, down, left, right, and the center?), but that's 5. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the count of non-zero elements in certain positions. For Example 1, the X has 5 non-zero elements (4 corners and center). But output is 2. That doesn't fit.\n\nWait, looking at the numbers in the inputs. All examples except 3,4,6 have numbers that are the same in their non-zero positions. Like Example 0 has all 5s except zeros. Example 1 has 8s. Example 2 has 5s. Example 5 has 4s. But Examples 3 and 4 have 1s and 8s, but the output is 3. So maybe the specific numbers don't matter as long as they are the same in non-zero positions.\n\nSo the key is the arrangement of non-zero elements.\n\nLooking for the output numbers:\n\nFor example:\n\n- Output 1: Examples 0 and 5. Their binary grids are:\n\nExample 0:\n\n1 1 0\n\n1 0 1\n\n0 1 0\n\nExample 5:\n\n1 1 0\n\n1 0 1\n\n0 1 0\n\nWait, wait, Example 0 and 5's binary grids are the same. So their outputs are both 1. That makes sense. So the output is determined by the binary pattern.\n\nSo the pattern is that each output corresponds to a specific binary configuration, regardless of the actual numbers used.\n\nSo, let's analyze each example's binary grid and see what output they have.\n\nExample 0 binary:\n1 1 0\n1 0 1\n0 1 0\nOutput 1.\n\nExample 1 binary:\n1 0 1\n0 1 0\n1 0 1\nOutput 2.\n\nExample 2 binary:\n1 0 1\n0 1 0\n1 0 1\nOutput 2. So same as Example 1, hence same output.\n\nExample 3 binary:\n0 1 1\n0 1 1\n1 0 0\nOutput 3.\n\nExample 4 binary:\n0 1 1\n0 1 1\n1 0 0\nSame as Example 3, so output 3.\n\nExample 5 binary:\n1 1 0\n1 0 1\n0 1 0\nSame as Example 0, output 1.\n\nExample 6 binary:\n0 1 0\n1 1 1\n0 1 0\nOutput 6.\n\nSo the outputs correspond to specific binary patterns. Now, what's the pattern?\n\nLooking at the outputs:\n\n1: The binary grid has a certain shape. Let's see Example 0/5's grid:\n\nRow0: 1 1 0\n\nRow1:1 0 1\n\nRow2:0 1 0\n\nThis looks like a sort of diagonal cross but not exactly. Maybe the number of \"arms\" or lines in the pattern.\n\nOutput 2: X-shaped (Example 1 and 2). So when the binary grid is X-shaped (corners and center), output is 2.\n\nOutput 3: Example 3 and 4's grid is:\n\nRow0: 0 1 1\n\nRow1:0 1 1\n\nRow2:1 0 0\n\nThis looks like a \"staircase\" or an L-shape. Maybe 3 non-zero blocks in the right two columns of the first two rows and one in the bottom left. Not sure. Output is 3.\n\nOutput 6: Example 6's grid is a plus sign (middle row and column). The output is 6. Maybe the plus has 5 non-zero elements, but output is 6. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the number of lines (rows, columns, or diagonals) that are all non-zero. Let's check:\n\nFor Example 1 (X-shaped), the diagonals would be non-zero. There are two diagonals, but the output is 2. So maybe 2 lines.\n\nExample 6's grid: middle row is all 1s (so that's one line), middle column is all 1s (another line). So total 2 lines, but output is 6. That doesn't fit.\n\nAnother idea: the output could be the sum of the number of non-zero elements in each row and column. Wait:\n\nExample 0's rows:\n\nRow0: 2 non-zero\n\nRow1:2\n\nRow2:1\n\nColumns:\n\nCol0: 2\n\nCol1: 2\n\nCol2: 1\n\nSum: 2+2+1 + 2+2+1 = 9. Output is 1. Not matching.\n\nAlternative approach: The output could be the number of connected components in the binary grid. For example, a plus sign would be a single connected component. An X shape would also be a single connected component. But Example 0's grid has several 1s connected in a way. Let's see:\n\nExample 0 binary:\n\nRow0: 1 1 0\n\nRow1:1 0 1\n\nRow2:0 1 0\n\nThe connected components here: The top-left 1 is connected to the middle-left 1, which is connected to the middle-right 1 via row1, but wait, no. Wait, adjacent (including diagonally?) If adjacency is only up/down/left/right (no diagonals), then the components are:\n\nRow0: 1-1 (connected), then the middle-left 1 is connected to them. But row0's third element is 0, and row1's third element is 1. So row1's first element is connected to row0's first. Row1's third is 1, connected to row2's middle 1 (since row2's middle is 1). So maybe the entire grid forms one connected component. But output is 1. So maybe the output is the number of connected components? But Example 1's X shape is all connected via the center. So connected components would be 1, but output is 2. Hmm, that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternative idea: Maybe the output is the count of certain symmetries. For example, the X shape (Examples 1 and 2) have both diagonal and maybe rotational symmetry, leading to output 2. The plus sign (Example 6) has vertical and horizontal symmetry, which might be 4, but output is 6. Not sure.\n\nLooking at the outputs again:\n\nExample 6's output is 6. Let's see the binary grid for Example 6:\n\n0 1 0\n\n1 1 1\n\n0 1 0\n\nThis is a plus sign. If we count the number of 'arms' in the plus, which is four (up, down, left, right), plus the center. So 5 elements, but output is 6. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, think of the output as the sum of the digits in the binary grid. For Example 0, there are 6 ones (1+1+0 +1+0+1 +0+1+0 = 1+1+1+1+1= 5?), but output is 1. Doesn't fit.\n\nWait, another idea: The output could be the number of 2x2 squares that contain exactly two non-zero elements. Let's check Example 0:\n\nRows:\n\n1 1 0\n\n1 0 1\n\n0 1 0\n\nLooking for 2x2 squares:\n\nTop-left square (rows 0-1, cols 0-1):\n\n1 1\n\n1 0 \u2192 three 1s. So no.\n\nTop-middle (cols 1-2):\n\n1 0\n\n0 1 \u2192 two 1s. That's two, so counts as 1.\n\nMiddle-left square (rows1-2, cols0-1):\n\n1 0\n\n0 1 \u2192 two 1s. Another count.\n\nMiddle-middle:\n\n0 1\n\n1 0 \u2192 two 1s. Another count.\n\nMiddle-right:\n\n1 0\n\n0 0 \u2192 one 1. No.\n\nBottom-middle:\n\n1 0\n\n0 0 \u2192 one. No.\n\nTotal of 3 squares. But output is 1. So that doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. Maybe another approach. Let's look at the outputs again:\n\nExamples with output 1: 0 and 5. Their binary grids are the same. Let me visualize them:\n\nExample 0:\n\nRow0: 1 1 0\n\nRow1:1 0 1\n\nRow2:0 1 0\n\nExample 5's grid is same.\n\nExamples with output 2: 1, 2 (X-shape).\n\nExamples with output 3: 3,4 (similar pattern).\n\nExample 6 has output 6 (plus sign).\n\nPerhaps the output corresponds to the number of corners filled in the binary grid.\n\nBut let's check:\n\nExample 0: top-left, top-middle, middle-left, middle-right, bottom-middle. Corners (top-left, top-right, bottom-left, bottom-right): only top-left is 1. So one corner filled. Output is 1. That could fit.\n\nExample 1: X-shape, so all four corners are 1. So four corners filled. Output 2. Doesn't fit.\n\nWait, but output 2 when four corners are filled. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the number of corners plus the center. For Example 0: corners filled (1) + center (0) \u2192 1. Output 1. For Example 1: corners (4) + center (1) \u2192 5. Output is 2. Doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the sum of the positions of the non-zero elements. Like each position has a code (e.g., row*3 + col +1), but that seems complicated.\n\nAnother idea: The output could be the count of how many times the pattern of non-zero elements appears in the grid when rotated or mirrored. For example, the X-shape (output 2) might be considered as having two lines of symmetry, hence output 2. But how would that apply to other examples.\n\nWait, for Example 0's grid, if you look at the positions of non-zero elements:\n\n(0,0), (0,1), (1,0), (1,2), (2,1). This doesn't form a common shape. Maybe it's the letter 'K' or something. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, think of the grid as a numeric keypad. The numbers pressed correspond to digits. For example, the positions:\n\n1 2 3\n\n4 5 6\n\n7 8 9\n\nIf the non-zero elements are positions 1,2,4,6,8, then sum those numbers: 1+2+4+6+8=21. But output is 1. Doesn't fit.\n\nAnother approach: Maybe the output is the number of edges in the shape formed by the non-zero elements. For example, the X-shape would have lines crossing, leading to certain edges. But this seems vague.\n\nAlternatively, think of the grid as representing a digital display (like seven-segment displays). Each output number corresponds to the segments lit. For example, output 6 in Example 6. A seven-segment 6 has all segments except the top-right. Maybe the plus sign in the grid corresponds to certain segments. But mapping this seems complicated.\n\nWait, Example 6's output is 6. The grid is a plus sign, which in seven-segment display, the middle segments are lit for 0, but 6 has the lower segments. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is the count of the number of 'holes' in the shape. But that's not clear.\n\nLet's look at the Test Input:\n\n[2,0,2]\n\n[0,2,0]\n\n[2,0,2]\n\nConverting to binary:\n\n1 0 1\n\n0 1 0\n\n1 0 1\n\nThis is an X-shape, which in the training examples (Examples 1 and 2) output 2. So the test input's output should be [2]."
