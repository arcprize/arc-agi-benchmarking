        "cot_1": "Okay, let's see. I need to figure out the pattern here from the training examples and apply it to the test input. Let's look at each example one by one.\n\nStarting with Example 0. The input is three rows:\n[2, 2, 1]\n[2, 1, 2]\n[2, 8, 1]\n\nAnd the output is:\n[1, 8, 2]\n[2, 1, 2]\n[1, 2, 2]\n\nHmm. Let's compare input and output. Let me check each row. The middle row in the input is [2,1,2], and in the output, it's the same. So maybe the middle row stays the same. Let's check other examples to confirm.\n\nLooking at Example 1. Input has a middle row [2,4,4], and output's middle row is [4,4,2]. Wait, no, that's different. Wait, the input's middle row here is [2,4,4], output's middle row is [4,4,2]. So maybe the middle row changes. Wait, but in Example 0, the middle row stayed the same. That's conflicting. Maybe the middle row isn't always the same.\n\nWait, maybe the pattern involves sorting or some kind of rotation. Let me look again.\n\nExample 0: The input's first row is [2,2,1]. The output's first row is [1,8,2]. Wait, where does the 8 come from? The third row of the input is [2,8,1]. The output's first row has 8 in the middle. So maybe the rows are being rearranged in some way, perhaps swapping elements between rows.\n\nLooking at the third row of the input in Example 0: [2,8,1]. The output's first row is [1,8,2], which is the reverse of the third input row. The output's third row is [1,2,2], which might be the reverse of the first input row? The first input row is [2,2,1], reversed is [1,2,2], which matches the output's third row. So maybe the first and third rows are reversed, and the middle row is as is. But in Example 0, the middle row in output is same as input. Let's check other examples.\n\nExample 1 input:\n[9,2,4]\n[2,4,4]\n[2,9,2]\n\nOutput:\n[2,9,2]\n[4,4,2]\n[4,2,9]\n\nThe first row of the input is [9,2,4], and the output's first row is [2,9,2]. Wait, that's the third row of the input. The third row of input is [2,9,2], which becomes the first row of output. Then the output's middle row is [4,4,2], which is the reverse of the input's middle row [2,4,4]? Wait, reversed [2,4,4] would be [4,4,2], which matches. Then the third row of output is [4,2,9], which is the reverse of the input's first row [9,2,4] reversed is [4,2,9]. So maybe the output's rows are:\n\n- The third input row becomes the first output row.\n- The middle input row is reversed.\n- The first input row is reversed and becomes the third output row.\n\nWait, let's check that.\n\nIn Example 0, input rows are:\nRow 0: [2,2,1]\nRow 1: [2,1,2]\nRow 2: [2,8,1]\n\nOutput rows:\nRow 0: [1,8,2] (which is input row 2 reversed: [2,8,1] reversed is [1,8,2] \u2192 yes)\nRow 1: [2,1,2] (same as input row 1)\nRow 2: [1,2,2] (input row 0 reversed: [1,2,2])\n\nSo that fits. So the pattern here is:\n\n- The output's first row is the reversed third row of the input.\n- The output's middle row is the same as the input's middle row.\n- The output's third row is the reversed first row of the input.\n\nBut wait, in Example 1, input rows:\n\nRow0: [9,2,4]\nRow1: [2,4,4]\nRow2: [2,9,2]\n\nOutput rows:\n\nRow0: [2,9,2] \u2192 which is input row2 (reversed? [2,9,2] reversed is same since it's a palindrome). So yes, reversed row2 is same, so output row0 is reversed row2.\n\nRow1: [4,4,2] \u2192 input row1 is [2,4,4], reversed is [4,4,2], so that's the middle row reversed.\n\nWait, but in Example 0, the middle row wasn't reversed. Wait, in Example 0's output, the middle row is [2,1,2], which is the same as the input's middle row. But in Example1, the middle row is reversed. So that's conflicting.\n\nHmm, maybe I need to re-examine. Let's check Example0 again. Input row1: [2,1,2]. Output row1 is same. So middle row is same. But in Example1, input row1: [2,4,4], output row1: [4,4,2], which is reversed. So this contradicts. So perhaps my initial assumption is wrong.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the entire matrix is rotated or transformed in a different way. Let's think of the matrix as a 3x3 grid and see how the elements are moved.\n\nAnother approach: check if the output is the transpose of the input matrix. The transpose would switch rows and columns. For example, in a matrix:\n\nOriginal:\n\na b c\n\nd e f\n\ng h i\n\nTranspose is:\n\na d g\n\nb e h\n\nc f i\n\nBut looking at Example0:\n\nInput:\n\n2 2 1\n\n2 1 2\n\n2 8 1\n\nTranspose would be:\n\n2 2 2\n\n2 1 8\n\n1 2 1\n\nBut the output is:\n\n1 8 2\n\n2 1 2\n\n1 2 2\n\nWhich doesn't match the transpose. So maybe not transpose.\n\nAnother idea: Maybe each row is sorted, but in a particular order. Let's see.\n\nIn Example0 output rows:\n\n[1,8,2] \u2192 sorted would be [1,2,8], but it's not. So that's not sorting.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rows are rotated. For example, the first row becomes the third row reversed, and the third becomes the first reversed, and the middle row is reversed. But let's check.\n\nIn Example0:\n\nOriginal row0: [2,2,1] reversed is [1,2,2] \u2192 becomes row2 of output.\n\nOriginal row2: [2,8,1] reversed is [1,8,2] \u2192 becomes row0 of output.\n\nMiddle row is same. So that's the pattern here.\n\nIn Example1:\n\nOriginal row0: [9,2,4] reversed is [4,2,9] \u2192 becomes row2 of output.\n\nOriginal row2: [2,9,2] reversed is [2,9,2] (since it's a palindrome) \u2192 becomes row0 of output.\n\nMiddle row [2,4,4] reversed is [4,4,2] \u2192 becomes the middle row. So in this example, the middle row is reversed. But in Example0, the middle row wasn't reversed. Wait, this is a contradiction. So why in Example0 the middle row stays the same, but in Example1, it's reversed?\n\nWait, looking back, in Example0, the middle row was [2,1,2], which is a palindrome. So reversing it doesn't change it. So maybe the pattern is that the first and third rows are reversed and swapped, and the middle row is reversed. But if the middle row is a palindrome, reversing it leaves it the same.\n\nAh, that makes sense. So for all three rows, the output is:\n\n- Output row0 is input row2 reversed.\n\n- Output row1 is input row1 reversed.\n\n- Output row2 is input row0 reversed.\n\nBut let's check this against the examples.\n\nExample0:\n\ninput row0: [2,2,1] reversed \u2192 [1,2,2] \u2192 output row2.\n\ninput row1: [2,1,2] reversed \u2192 same \u2192 output row1.\n\ninput row2: [2,8,1] reversed \u2192 [1,8,2] \u2192 output row0.\n\nWhich matches the output.\n\nExample1:\n\ninput row0: [9,2,4] reversed \u2192 [4,2,9] \u2192 output row2.\n\ninput row1: [2,4,4] reversed \u2192 [4,4,2] \u2192 output row1.\n\ninput row2: [2,9,2] reversed \u2192 [2,9,2] \u2192 output row0.\n\nYes, that fits.\n\nCheck Example2:\n\nInput:\n\n[8,8,8]\n\n[5,5,8]\n\n[8,5,5]\n\nOutput:\n\n[5,5,8]\n\n[8,5,5]\n\n[8,8,8]\n\nAccording to the pattern:\n\noutput row0: input row2 reversed \u2192 [8,5,5] reversed is [5,5,8] \u2192 yes.\n\noutput row1: input row1 reversed \u2192 [5,5,8] reversed \u2192 [8,5,5] \u2192 which is the second row of output. Wait, the input row1 is [5,5,8], reversed is [8,5,5] \u2192 which is output row1. Then output row2 is input row0 reversed \u2192 [8,8,8] reversed is same \u2192 output row2. Which matches.\n\nYes.\n\nExample3:\n\nInput:\n\n[3,2,9]\n\n[9,9,9]\n\n[2,3,3]\n\nOutput:\n\n[3,3,2]\n\n[9,9,9]\n\n[9,2,3]\n\nApplying the pattern:\n\noutput row0: input row2 reversed \u2192 [2,3,3] reversed \u2192 [3,3,2] \u2192 correct.\n\noutput row1: input row1 reversed \u2192 [9,9,9] reversed \u2192 same \u2192 correct.\n\noutput row2: input row0 reversed \u2192 [3,2,9] reversed \u2192 [9,2,3] \u2192 correct.\n\nSo the pattern is that the output matrix is formed by:\n\n- The first row is the reversed third row of the input.\n\n- The middle row is the reversed middle row of the input.\n\n- The third row is the reversed first row of the input.\n\nSo, applying this to the test input:\n\nTest Input:\n\n[6,4,4] \u2192 row0\n\n[6,6,4] \u2192 row1\n\n[4,6,7] \u2192 row2\n\nApplying the pattern:\n\noutput row0: reverse row2 \u2192 [4,6,7] reversed \u2192 [7,6,4]\n\noutput row1: reverse row1 \u2192 [6,6,4] reversed \u2192 [4,6,6]\n\noutput row2: reverse row0 \u2192 [6,4,4] reversed \u2192 [4,4,6]\n\nBut wait, let me check. Wait, the output matrix should be:\n\n[reversed row2, reversed row1, reversed row0]\n\nSo the output rows are:\n\nRow0: reversed row2 \u2192 [4,6,7] reversed \u2192 [7,6,4]\n\nRow1: reversed row1 \u2192 [6,6,4] reversed \u2192 [4,6,6]\n\nRow2: reversed row0 \u2192 [6,4,4] reversed \u2192 [4,4,6]\n\nSo the output matrix should be:\n\n[7,6,4]\n\n[4,6,6]\n\n[4,4,6]\n\nBut let me check if this is correct. But wait, in the training examples, the rows are arranged as:\n\nFor example, in Example0:\n\nInput rows are:\n\nRow0: [2,2,1]\n\nRow1: [2,1,2]\n\nRow2: [2,8,1]\n\nOutput rows:\n\nRow0: reversed row2 \u2192 [1,8,2]\n\nRow1: reversed row1 \u2192 [2,1,2] (since reversed is same)\n\nRow2: reversed row0 \u2192 [1,2,2]\n\nSo yes, the output is [reversed row2, reversed row1, reversed row0]. Wait no, in the first example, row1 is reversed. But in Example0, row1 is [2,1,2], reversed is same, so output row1 is same. But according to the pattern, output row1 is reversed row1 of input.\n\nSo the general pattern is:\n\nOutput matrix is:\n\n[reverse(input_row2), reverse(input_row1), reverse(input_row0)]\n\nYes. So each row is reversed, and then the entire matrix is reversed in row order. Wait, no. Let me rephrase. The output's first row is the reversed third row of input. The output's second row is the reversed second row of input. The output's third row is the reversed first row of input. So the rows are arranged as reversed input rows in reverse order.\n\nSo for the test input:\n\nRow0: [6,4,4]\n\nRow1: [6,6,4]\n\nRow2: [4,6,7]\n\nReversed row2: [7,6,4] \u2192 becomes output row0.\n\nReversed row1: [4,6,6] \u2192 becomes output row1.\n\nReversed row0: [4,4,6] \u2192 becomes output row2.\n\nSo the output should be:\n\n[7,6,4]\n\n[4,6,6]\n\n[4,4,6]\n\nWait, but let's check if that matches any of the training examples. Let's look at Example1's output. Input row0: [9,2,4], reversed is [4,2,9], which becomes output row2. So yes.\n\nSo applying this pattern to the test input gives the above result. So that's the answer.",

        "cot_2": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. So, there are these input matrices and output matrices. Let me look at each example and see what's changing.\n\nStarting with Example 0:\nInput:\n[2, 2, 1]\n[2, 1, 2]\n[2, 8, 1]\n\nOutput:\n[1, 8, 2]\n[2, 1, 2]\n[1, 2, 2]\n\nHmm. Let's see the rows. The original first row is [2,2,1], and the output first row is [1,8,2]. Wait, the middle element here is 8, which was in the third row of the input. Maybe there's some rotation or shifting involved. Let me check the other rows. The input's second row stays the same. The third input row becomes [1,2,2] in the output. Maybe it's about reversing rows or columns. Or perhaps moving elements between rows.\n\nWait, maybe each row is being rotated in some way. Let me check another example.\n\nExample 1:\nInput:\n[9, 2, 4]\n[2, 4, 4]\n[2, 9, 2]\n\nOutput:\n[2, 9, 2]\n[4, 4, 2]\n[4, 2, 9]\n\nLooking at the first input row [9,2,4], output first row is [2,9,2]. Wait, that's the third row of the input. Then the second row becomes [4,4,2], which is the original second row reversed? [2,4,4] reversed is [4,4,2], yes. And the third output row is [4,2,9], which is the original first row reversed [9,2,4] becomes [4,2,9] if reversed. Wait, but the first row in output is the original third row. So maybe the rows are being rotated. Like, the rows are shifted up, and each row is reversed or something?\n\nWait, in Example 0, the input rows are:\n\nRow0: [2,2,1]\n\nRow1: [2,1,2]\n\nRow2: [2,8,1]\n\nOutput rows:\n\nRow0: [1,8,2]\n\nRow1: [2,1,2]\n\nRow2: [1,2,2]\n\nHmm. The middle row stays the same. The output row0 seems to combine elements from row0 and row2. Like, the first element is 1 (from row0's third element?), the second is 8 (from row2's second element), third is 2 (from row0's second element?). Not sure. Alternatively, maybe the output is the input rotated 90 degrees or something. Let's check dimensions. All examples are 3x3 matrices. Rotating 90 degrees would transpose and reverse each row. Let's test that.\n\nTake Example 0 input:\n\nOriginal matrix:\n\n2 2 1\n\n2 1 2\n\n2 8 1\n\nTransposing would make columns into rows:\n\nRow0: 2,2,2\n\nRow1: 2,1,8\n\nRow2:1,2,1\n\nThen reversing each row after transpose (for 90-degree rotation):\n\nRow0 reversed: 2,2,2 \u2192 stays same.\n\nRow1 reversed: 8,1,2.\n\nRow2 reversed:1,2,1.\n\nBut the output of Example 0 is:\n\n1,8,2\n\n2,1,2\n\n1,2,2\n\nThat doesn't match. So maybe not a rotation. Let me think differently.\n\nLooking at Example 3:\n\nInput:\n\n[3, 2, 9]\n\n[9, 9, 9]\n\n[2, 3, 3]\n\nOutput:\n\n[3, 3, 2]\n\n[9, 9, 9]\n\n[9, 2, 3]\n\nSo here, the middle row stays the same again. The first row of the output is [3,3,2], which is the third row of the input [2,3,3] reversed (3,3,2) but reversed again? Wait, [2,3,3] reversed is [3,3,2], which matches the first output row. The third output row is [9,2,3], which is the first input row [3,2,9] reversed \u2192 [9,2,3]. So, perhaps in each example, the middle row remains the same, the first row is the reversed third row of the input, and the third row is the reversed first row of the input?\n\nWait in Example 0:\n\nInput rows:\n\nRow0: [2,2,1]\n\nRow1: [2,1,2] (unchanged)\n\nRow2: [2,8,1]\n\nOutput rows:\n\nRow0: [1,8,2] \u2192 which is row2 reversed? [2,8,1] reversed is [1,8,2]. Yes. So output row0 is reversed row2 of input.\n\nOutput row2 is [1,2,2] \u2192 reversed row0 of input [2,2,1] reversed is [1,2,2]. Yes.\n\nSo maybe the pattern is:\n\n- The middle row stays the same.\n\n- The first row of the output is the reversed third row of the input.\n\n- The third row of the output is the reversed first row of the input.\n\nLet me check Example 1.\n\nInput:\n\nRow0: [9,2,4]\n\nRow1: [2,4,4]\n\nRow2: [2,9,2]\n\nOutput:\n\nRow0: [2,9,2] \u2192 reversed row2 is [2,9,2] \u2192 same as input row2, reversed would be same because row2 is [2,9,2], reversed is [2,9,2]. So output row0 is reversed row2 (same as row2).\n\nOutput row2 is [4,2,9], which is reversed row0 [9,2,4] \u2192 reversed is [4,2,9]. Yes.\n\nSo that fits. Similarly, in Example 3, output row0 is reversed row2 of input (input row2 is [2,3,3], reversed [3,3,2]), and output row2 is reversed row0 of input (input row0 [3,2,9] reversed is [9,2,3]).\n\nSo the pattern seems to be:\n\nFor a 3x3 matrix:\n\n- The middle row (second row) remains unchanged.\n\n- The first row of the output is the reversed third row of the input.\n\n- The third row of the output is the reversed first row of the input.\n\nSo the transformation is swapping the first and third rows, reversing each, while keeping the middle row as is.\n\nTesting Example 2:\n\nInput:\n\n[8,8,8]\n\n[5,5,8]\n\n[8,5,5]\n\nOutput:\n\n[5,5,8]\n\n[8,5,5]\n\n[8,8,8]\n\nInput row0 reversed: [8,8,8] \u2192 reversed is same. Input row2 reversed: [5,5,8]. So output row0 should be reversed input row2 [8,5,5] reversed \u2192 [5,5,8]. Which matches the first output row [5,5,8]. Output row2 is reversed input row0, which is [8,8,8], same as input row0. So the output rows are:\n\nRow0: reversed input row2 \u2192 [5,5,8]\n\nRow1: same as input row1 (but input row1 is [5,5,8], but output row1 is [8,5,5]. Wait, wait. Wait in Example 2, the input is:\n\n[8,8,8]\n\n[5,5,8]\n\n[8,5,5]\n\nThe output is:\n\n[5,5,8]\n\n[8,5,5]\n\n[8,8,8]\n\nWait, according to our pattern, the middle row should remain the same. But input row1 is [5,5,8], but output row1 is [8,5,5]. That contradicts the pattern. Hmm. So maybe my previous hypothesis is wrong.\n\nWait, Example 2's output row1 is [8,5,5], which is input's row2. Oh, wait. So maybe the middle row is being swapped in a different way.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the entire matrix is rotated in some way, but maybe the middle row isn't always the same. Let's re-examine Example 0.\n\nWait in Example 0, the middle row of input is [2,1,2], and the output's middle row is the same. In Example 1, the middle input row is [2,4,4], output's is [4,4,2]. Wait, that's different. Oh, so the middle row does change in Example 1. So my previous idea is incorrect.\n\nHmm. So maybe the middle row isn't fixed. That complicates things.\n\nLet me look again at all examples.\n\nExample 0:\n\nInput rows:\n\n[2, 2, 1]\n\n[2, 1, 2]\n\n[2, 8, 1]\n\nOutput:\n\n[1,8,2]\n\n[2,1,2]\n\n[1,2,2]\n\nMiddle row is the same. But in Example 1:\n\nInput:\n\n[9,2,4]\n\n[2,4,4]\n\n[2,9,2]\n\nOutput:\n\n[2,9,2]\n\n[4,4,2]\n\n[4,2,9]\n\nMiddle input row is [2,4,4], output middle row is [4,4,2]. So reversed. So that's different. So the middle row in Example 0 is same, but in Example 1 it's reversed. So maybe the pattern isn't about keeping the middle row the same.\n\nAlternative approach: Maybe each row is transformed in a certain way. Let's check each row's transformation.\n\nIn Example 0:\n\nInput row0: [2,2,1] \u2192 output row0: [1,8,2]. Hmm, 8 is from row2 of input. Maybe each output row is a combination of elements from different input rows.\n\nBut that seems complicated. Alternatively, perhaps the matrix is being rotated in a certain way.\n\nAnother possibility: The output matrix is the input matrix rotated 180 degrees. Let's see. Rotating 180 degrees would reverse the order of rows and reverse each row's elements.\n\nFor Example 0:\n\nOriginal rows:\n\nRow0: [2,2,1]\n\nRow1: [2,1,2]\n\nRow2: [2,8,1]\n\nReversed rows order: [row2, row1, row0]\n\nThen reverse each row:\n\nrow2 reversed: [1,8,2]\n\nrow1 reversed: [2,1,2]\n\nrow0 reversed: [1,2,2]\n\nSo the output would be:\n\n[1,8,2]\n\n[2,1,2]\n\n[1,2,2]\n\nWhich matches Example 0's output. So that works. Let's check Example 1.\n\nInput rows:\n\n[9,2,4]\n\n[2,4,4]\n\n[2,9,2]\n\nReversed rows order: [row2, row1, row0]\n\nRow2 reversed: [2,9,2]\n\nRow1 reversed: [4,4,2]\n\nRow0 reversed: [4,2,9]\n\nWhich gives:\n\n[2,9,2]\n\n[4,4,2]\n\n[4,2,9]\n\nWhich matches the output of Example 1. Example 2:\n\nInput:\n\n[8,8,8]\n\n[5,5,8]\n\n[8,5,5]\n\nReversed rows order: [row2, row1, row0]\n\nRow2 reversed: [5,5,8]\n\nRow1 reversed: [8,5,5]\n\nRow0 reversed: [8,8,8]\n\nWhich gives the output of Example 2. And Example 3:\n\nInput:\n\n[3,2,9]\n\n[9,9,9]\n\n[2,3,3]\n\nReversed rows: row2, row1, row0.\n\nRow2 reversed: [3,3,2]\n\nRow1 reversed: [9,9,9]\n\nRow0 reversed: [9,2,3]\n\nWhich matches the output. So the pattern is: rotate the matrix 180 degrees. That is, reverse the order of the rows and then reverse each individual row.\n\nSo for each input matrix, to get the output, you reverse the order of the rows (so the first row becomes the last, etc.), and then reverse each row's elements.\n\nLet me test with the test input:\n\nTest input:\n\n[6,4,4]\n\n[6,6,4]\n\n[4,6,7]\n\nReversing the row order gives:\n\n[4,6,7]\n\n[6,6,4]\n\n[6,4,4]\n\nThen reverse each row:\n\nFirst row reversed: [7,6,4]\n\nSecond row reversed: [4,6,6]\n\nThird row reversed: [4,4,6]\n\nSo the output should be:\n\n[7,6,4]\n\n[4,6,6]\n\n[4,4,6]\n\nWait, let me check that again.\n\nOriginal test input:\n\nRow0: [6,4,4]\n\nRow1: [6,6,4]\n\nRow2: [4,6,7]\n\nReverse row order: row2, row1, row0 \u2192 [ [4,6,7], [6,6,4], [6,4,4] ]\n\nThen reverse each row:\n\nFirst new row (was row2) [4,6,7] reversed \u2192 [7,6,4]\n\nSecond new row (was row1) [6,6,4] reversed \u2192 [4,6,6]\n\nThird new row (was row0) [6,4,4] reversed \u2192 [4,4,6]\n\nSo the output matrix should be:\n\n[7,6,4]\n\n[4,6,6]\n\n[4,4,6]\n\nBut let me check the format of the training examples. For example, in Example 0, the output rows are:\n\n[1,8,2]\n\n[2,1,2]\n\n[1,2,2]\n\nWhich corresponds to the 180 rotation. So applying this pattern to the test input should give the above result."
