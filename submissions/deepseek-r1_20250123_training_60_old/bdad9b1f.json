        "cot_1": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. So, looking at the training examples, I need to understand how the input grids are transformed into the output grids.\n\nStarting with Example 0. The input has some 8s and 2s. The output seems to expand those numbers in some way. Let's compare row by row.\n\nIn the input, the third row is [2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0], and in the output, this row becomes [2, 2, 2, 2, 4, 2]. Hmm, so the 2s are extended to the right, and there's a 4 in the fifth position. Also, the rows above and below the original 8s in the first two rows now have 8s in the same column. Wait, looking at the first two input rows, the 8 is in column 5. In the output, those rows are the same, but then the rows below (row 2, which was the third row) and others now have 8s in column 5 as well? Wait no. Wait, the output for example 0 shows that the third row in the input becomes the third row in the output with 2s spread out, and then the fourth, fifth, sixth rows all have 8 in column 5. Wait, original input's first two rows have 8 in column 5. Then in the output, those rows are the same, but the rows below (rows 3,4,5) in the output all have 8 in column 5. But wait the original third row in input has 2s. So maybe the 8s are being propagated downwards except where there's another number?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's a kind of cellular automaton where numbers spread in certain directions. Let me think. The 8s in the first example are in the same column. The output has those 8s staying in their original positions, but then rows below and above also get 8s in that column. Wait, in example 0's output, the first two rows are same as input. Then the third row has 8 in column 5? Let me check. The third row of output is [2,2,2,2,4,2]. Oh, the fifth element is 4. Wait, maybe the 8s and 2s are combining in some way.\n\nLooking at example 1. The input has 8s in column 2 of the first two rows. Then in the output, the third row also has 8 in column 2, and the fourth row has 2s spread out. The fourth row in the input has two 2s at the end. In the output, that row becomes [2,4,2,2,2,2]. So the two 2s became 4 and then spread? Wait, maybe when numbers are adjacent, they combine and spread. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe each number is expanding to fill the row and column. For instance, in example 0, the 8s are in column 5 of rows 0 and 1. In the output, all rows from 0 to 5 in column 5 have 8, except the third row which has a 4. Wait no, the third row's column 5 is 4, which is 8/2? Or maybe when there's a collision between 2s and 8s, they add up? Let's see. The third row in example 0's input has 2,2,0,... Then in the output, that row becomes 2,2,2,2,4,2. The 4 is in column 4, which is where the 8s were in the first two rows. So perhaps when the 2s spread into that column, they combine with the 8s? But 2+8=10? That doesn't match. But the 4 is 8/2? Or 8 - 2*2=4? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that each number (like 8 or 2) creates a cross shape (horizontal and vertical lines) in their respective rows and columns. But with some overlapping rules. For example, an 8 in a cell would fill its entire row and column with 8s, but if another number's cross overlaps, then they combine. Let's test this.\n\nIn example 0's input, the first two rows have 8 in column 5. So their cross would be all cells in their rows and columns. But the third row has 2s in columns 0 and 1. So their cross would be row 2 and columns 0 and 1. When these crosses overlap, perhaps the values are added. So in the output's third row, columns 0 and 1 are 2 (from the original 2s), then columns 2-3 are 2 (from the 2's row), column 4 would be 8 (from the original 8's column) plus 2 (from the 2's row) \u2192 but in the output it's 4. Hmm, maybe not addition. Alternatively, the maximum value? But in example 0's output column 4 is 4, which isn't the max of 8 and 2.\n\nWait, maybe the 8s in column 5 of rows 0 and 1 create vertical lines (columns 5) filled with 8s. But the third row's 2s in columns 0 and 1 create a horizontal line (row 2) filled with 2s. But in the output, row 2 has 2s in all columns except column 4 which is 4. So perhaps where the cross intersects (row 2, column 5) would have 8 (from vertical) and 2 (from horizontal), but in the output, row 2, column 5 is 4. That's conflicting.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 8s and 2s are sources that spread outwards. Each number propagates to adjacent cells in some way. For instance, 8s might spread downward and upward, 2s spread right and left. But then how do they combine?\n\nLooking at example 1's input: the 8s are in column 2, rows 0 and 1. The output's rows 0,1,2,4,5 have 8 in column 2. The fourth row of the input has two 2s at the end. The output's fourth row (index 3) is [2,4,2,2,2,2]. The 4 is in column 1. Maybe the 8s from column 2 spread left and right, and the 2s spread upwards. So when they meet, their values are added. For example, in row 3, column 1: the 2s in row 3, columns 4 and 5 (original input) spread leftwards. So row 3 becomes filled with 2s. But the 8 in column 2 could be spreading into row 3's column 2. So combining 8 and 2 gives 10, but in the output, row 3, column 1 is 4. Hmm, that doesn't add up.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each number creates a diamond-shaped area. For example, an 8 in a cell affects cells at a certain distance, and similarly for 2. When their areas overlap, the values are summed. But I'm not sure.\n\nAnother approach: looking for the output rows. Let's check each example's output:\n\nIn example 0's output:\n\nThe first two rows are the same as the input. Then the third row (original 2s) becomes filled with 2s except column 4, which is 4. The fourth to sixth rows have 8 in column 5.\n\nIn example 1's output:\n\nRows 0-1 same as input. Row 2 has 8 in column 2. Row 3 is filled with 2s except column 1 is 4. Rows 4-5 have 8 in column 2.\n\nWait, perhaps the pattern is that each non-zero number in the input creates a cross (horizontal and vertical lines) in the output, and where crosses overlap, the numbers are summed. For instance, in example 0:\n\nThe 8s in column 5, rows 0 and 1. Their crosses would be their entire rows and columns. So their rows (0 and 1) would be filled with 8s. Their column (5) would be filled with 8s. However, the third row's 2s (columns 0 and 1) in input would create a cross: row 2 filled with 2s, and columns 0 and 1 filled with 2s. Where the crosses intersect (column 5, rows 0-1 have 8s, row 2 column 0-1 have 2s, etc.), but how do they combine?\n\nLooking at the third row in example 0's output: the row is filled with 2s except column 4 is 4. Wait, the original 8s are in column 5. So maybe the 8s' column is 5, which is filled with 8s. But in row 2, column 5 would have 8 from the vertical cross, but in the output it's 4. That's confusing.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each non-zero number in the input generates a vertical line (same column) and horizontal line (same row) in the output, with their value. But when two lines cross, their values are multiplied. For example, in example 0, the 8s in row 0, column 5 would create a horizontal line (row 0) with 8s and vertical line (column 5) with 8s. The 2s in row 2, columns 0 and 1 would create a horizontal line (row 2) with 2s and vertical lines (columns 0 and 1) with 2s. Where these lines intersect, their values multiply. So in row 2, column 5: 2 (from row 2) * 8 (from column 5) = 16? But in the output, it's 4. Hmm, that's not matching.\n\nWait, in example 0's output, row 2, column 4 is 4. Let's check the input's row 2. The original row 2 in the input has 2s in columns 0 and 1. So maybe their horizontal spread fills the entire row 2 with 2s. The 8s in column 5 would fill column 5 with 8s. So in row 2, column 5 would be 8. But in the output, row 2, column 5 is 2. That's not possible. So maybe there's another rule.\n\nAlternatively, the numbers are spreading in their row and column, but the original numbers are the only ones that spread. For example, each 8 in the input causes their entire row and column to be filled with 8s. Similarly, each 2 in the input fills their entire row and column with 2s. If multiple numbers affect the same cell, their values are summed. Let's test this.\n\nIn example 0's input:\n\nThe 8s are in rows 0 and 1, column 5. So their influence would be rows 0 and 1 filled with 8s, and column 5 filled with 8s. The 2s in row 2, columns 0 and 1 would influence row 2 filled with 2s, and columns 0 and 1 filled with 2s. So the output would be the sum of these influences.\n\nFor cell (0,5): 8 (from row 0 and column 5) \u2192 8+8=16? But in the output, it's 8. So that can't be. Maybe if the maximum value is taken instead of sum.\n\nIf it's the maximum, then in cell (0,5), max(8,8) =8. For cell (2,0): max(2,2) =2. For cell (2,5): max(8,2) =8. But in the output example 0, row 2, column 5 is 2, not 8. Hmm, that doesn't fit. So that's not right.\n\nLooking back at example 0's output, row 2 is [2,2,2,2,4,2]. Column 4 in row 2 is 4. Why? Let's see. The original 8s in column 5. So maybe when a 2's row and an 8's column intersect, the result is 4. How? 8 divided by 2 is 4. Maybe when two different numbers' influences cross, their values are divided. So 8/2=4.\n\nSo for cell (2,5): it's in row 2 (2s) and column 5 (8s). So 8/2=4. But in the output, row 2, column 5 is 2, not 4. Wait, in example 0's output, row 2, column 5 is 2. But according to this idea, it should be 4. So maybe I'm missing something.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the numbers spread in their rows and columns, but when two different numbers' paths cross, they are combined by multiplying them. For example, 2 * 8 = 16. But that doesn't match the output either.\n\nThis is getting confusing. Let's look for another pattern. Maybe each number in the input creates a diamond-shaped area around it, but scaled by the number's value.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is created by mirroring or expanding the input's non-zero elements in some symmetric way.\n\nLooking at example 0's input:\n\nThe first two rows have an 8 in column 5. The third row has 2s in columns 0 and 1. The output has the first two rows unchanged. The third row is filled with 2s except column 4 is 4. Then rows 3-5 have 8s in column 5. So the 8s in column 5 have spread downward from rows 0 and 1, filling rows 3-5, but row 2's column 5 is 2. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 8s are falling down to the bottom, but when they hit the 2s, they merge. Like in a game of 2048. So the 8s in the first two rows of example 0 fall down, but the 2s are in row 2, so they might collide. But how does that create the output?\n\nAlternatively, the output is a result of each non-zero cell in the input \"activating\" their entire row and column with their value. But when multiple activations overlap, they combine in a certain way.\n\nLet me try to apply this to example 0:\n\nThe input has 8s in (0,5) and (1,5). Each of these activates their entire row and column. So (0,5) activates row 0 (all 8s) and column 5 (all 8s). Similarly for (1,5). Then the 2s in (2,0) and (2,1) activate row 2 (all 2s) and columns 0 and 1 (all 2s). So any cell that is in an activated row or column gets that value. If a cell is in multiple activated rows/columns, how is the value determined?\n\nIn example 0's output, cell (2,5) is in row 2 (activated by the 2s) and column 5 (activated by 8s). So which value does it take? The output shows 2 here. But in example 0's output, cell (2,5) is 2. So perhaps the latest activation or the minimum value? Not sure.\n\nBut in row 2, column 4 of example 0's output is 4. How does that happen? Column 4 isn't activated by any input in example 0's input. Unless there's another rule. Maybe when a row and column activation intersect, the product is taken. 2 (row) * 8 (column) = 16. But that's not the case here. The output is 4. So 8 / 2 =4. Maybe division?\n\nAlternatively, maybe when a cell is in both an activated row and column, the values are summed. For example, in cell (0,5): 8 (row) +8 (column) =16, but output is 8. So that can't be.\n\nAlternatively, the maximum of the row and column activations. For cell (2,5): max(2,8)=8. But output is 2. So that's not matching.\n\nThis is really challenging. Let's look at example 1's input and output.\n\nInput has 8s in (0,1) and (1,1). The 2s are in row 3, columns 4 and 5. The output has 8s in column 1 for rows 0-2 and 4-5. The row 3 is filled with 2s except column 1 is 4. So cell (3,1) has 4, which could be 8 (from column 1's activation) and 2 (from row 3's activation). So 8+2=10? No, 4. Maybe 8/2=4. So when a cell is activated by both row and column, the value is the column value divided by the row value. So 8 (column) divided by 2 (row) is 4. That would explain the 4s in the outputs where they intersect.\n\nIn example 0, cell (2,5) would be 8 (column) divided by 2 (row) \u21924. But in example 0's output, row 2, column 5 is 2, not 4. Wait, that's conflicting. So maybe this isn't the right approach.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output cells are the product of the number of row activations and column activations. For example, if a cell is activated by a row with value 2 and a column with value 8, then 2 * 8 =16. But no, the example shows 4.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the row and column activations are summed, but divided by some factor. Like (2 +8)/2=5, but the output shows 4. Not matching.\n\nWait, maybe it's the minimum of the row and column activations. For example, 8 and 2 \u2192 min is 2. But in example 1's output, cell (3,1) is 4. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe when a cell is activated by both a row and a column, the values are combined as (row_val + column_val) / 2. So (2+8)/2=5, but example 1's cell (3,1) is 4. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the row activation is multiplied by the column activation and then divided by 4. So 2*8=16/4=4. That would fit example 1's cell (3,1). And in example 0's cell (2,5), 2*8/4=4, but in example 0's output, cell (2,5) is 2. So that doesn't fit. Wait, example 0's row 2, column 5 is 2. So that would be (2 (row) * 8 (column)) / 4 =4. But output is 2. So not matching.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Let's think of another approach. Perhaps each non-zero number in the input causes a cross in the output, where the cross is the same number. If multiple crosses overlap, they are added. But in example 0:\n\nThe 8s in rows 0 and 1, column 5 would create crosses (their rows and columns) filled with 8s. The 2s in row 2, columns 0 and 1 create crosses (row 2, columns 0 and 1) filled with 2s. So overlapping areas would have 8+2=10. But the output doesn't show that. For example, in row 2, column 5: 8 from column activation, but output is 2. So this approach isn't working.\n\nAlternative idea: Each number in the input propagates in all four directions (up, down, left, right) to fill the grid, and when they meet, they combine in some way. For example, an 8 in a cell would spread in all directions, turning all cells in the same row and column into 8s. Similarly, 2s spread to their row and column. But when an 8 and a 2 meet in a cell, perhaps they create a 4.\n\nLooking at example 0: the 8s in column 5 spread to all rows in column 5, but row 2 has 2s that spread to their row. So in row 2, column 5: 8 from the column and 2 from the row \u2192 4. Then, in row 2's other columns, the 2s spread. This matches the output: row 2 in example 0's output is filled with 2s except column 4 (which is part of the 8's column?) Wait, no. In example 0's output, row 2's column 4 is 4. So maybe column 4 is another point of intersection. But where is the 8 in column 4? The input 8s are in column 5. So this doesn't explain the 4 in column 4.\n\nWait, maybe the 8s in column 5 spread to the left and right. Wait, but why would they spread to column 4?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the numbers spread in all directions until they hit the edge or another number. For example, the 8s in column 5 of rows 0 and 1 would spread left and right, filling their rows. The 2s in row 2, columns 0 and 1 would spread up and down, filling their columns and row. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by each non-zero cell generating a rectangle. For example, the 8s in the input generate a vertical line in their column, and the 2s generate a horizontal line in their row. Where they cross, their values are multiplied. But again, example 0's cell (2,5) would be 2*8=16, but output is 2.\n\nHmm. This is tricky. Let's look for another pattern.\n\nAnother observation: in both examples, the output's non-zero rows are those that were non-zero in the input, plus some adjacent ones. For example, in example 0's input, rows 0,1,2 have non-zero elements. In the output, rows 0,1,2,3,4,5 are filled with non-zero elements. Similarly for example 1. So the output seems to have more filled rows and columns than the input.\n\nAnother thought: the output for each example has the same structure where the non-zero elements in the input are mirrored or expanded in a symmetric pattern. For example, in example 0's output, the 8s in column 5 are present in all rows except row 2. Row 2, which had 2s, is filled with 2s except where it intersects with the 8s' column, which becomes 4.\n\nSimilarly, example 1's output has 8s in column 2 for all rows except row 3, which has 2s and a 4 where it intersects.\n\nSo perhaps the rule is:\n\n- For each number in the input, fill its entire row and column with that number.\n- When two different numbers' rows and columns intersect, the cell is set to the sum of the two numbers divided by 2 (or some other operation).\n- But example 0's row 2, column 5 is 2, but according to this rule, it would be (8 + 2) / 2 =5, which doesn't match the output. So that can't be right.\n\nAlternatively, when two different numbers' paths cross, the cell takes the value of the number from the column. For example, if a cell is in a column activated by 8 and a row activated by 2, it takes the column's value (8), but in example 0's output, row 2, column 5 is 2. That contradicts.\n\nAlternatively, the row takes priority over the column. So row activation determines the value. But in example 0, row 2 is filled with 2s, so column 5 in row 2 would be 2. But in the output, it is 2. However, in example 1, row 3 is filled with 2s except column 1 is 4, which is part of the column activated by 8. So maybe when a cell is activated by both a row and a column, the values are multiplied. For example, 2 * 8 =16, but that's not the case. Example 1's cell (3,1) is 4. So 8/2=4. So when a cell is in both a row activated by 2 and a column activated by 8, it becomes 8 / 2 =4.\n\nIn example 0's cell (2,5): row 2 is activated by 2, column 5 by 8. So 8 /2=4. But in example 0's output, that cell is 2. That doesn't fit. Unless I'm mixing up row and column.\n\nWait, maybe the division is column value divided by row value. So 8 / 2 =4. But in example 0's output, cell (2,5) is 2. So that's conflicting.\n\nThis is really confusing. Let's try to see if there's a different pattern. Maybe the output is built by creating a sort of \"average\" or \"merge\" of the rows and columns where non-zero elements exist.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the numbers in the input are expanded into a larger block. For example, each 8 creates a 3x3 block around it, but that seems not to fit.\n\nLooking at the test input:\n\nTest Input:\n\n[0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0]\n[0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0]\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nSo the 8s are in rows 0 and 1, column 3. The 2s are in row 4, columns 0 and 1.\n\nFollowing the pattern from the examples, the output should have:\n\n- Rows 0 and 1 remain the same.\n- The 8s in column 3 would spread to fill their column in all rows except where they intersect with the 2s' row.\n- The 2s in row 4 would spread to fill their row, and their columns 0 and 1 would fill their rows.\n- Where the 8s' column and 2s' row intersect, the value is 4 (8/2).\n\nSo, in the test input's output, the rows 0 and 1 would have 8s in column 3. Rows 2-5 would have 8s in column 3 except for row 4 (where the 2s are), which would have 4 in column 3. The row 4 would be filled with 2s, except column 3 is 4. Additionally, the columns 0 and 1 (from the 2s in row 4) would fill their columns with 2s. But looking at the training examples, the 2s' columns are filled in their rows. For example, in example 0, the 2s in columns 0 and 1 of row 2 filled their columns with 2s.\n\nWait, in example 0's output, columns 0 and 1 are filled with 2s in all rows? Looking at example 0's output:\n\nRow 0: [0,0,0,0,8,0] \u2192 columns 0 and 1 are 0. So no. Hmm, this contradicts.\n\nMaybe the spread is different. Perhaps each number's row and column are filled with the same value, but only in the output's rows that are between the original input's rows and the bottom, or something like that.\n\nAlternatively, the spread is only downwards and to the right. For example, an 8 in a cell propagates down the column and to the right in the row, filling cells with 8 until another number is encountered.\n\nBut in example 0, the 8s in rows 0 and 1, column 5 would propagate down the column. But the output shows that the entire column 5 is filled with 8s except row 2, which has 4. That suggests that the propagation is blocked or modified by the 2s in row 2.\n\nThis is really challenging. Another angle: looking at the total number of 4s in the output. In example 0, there's one 4 in row 2, column 4. In example 1, there's one 4 in row 3, column 1. So the 4 appears where a row filled with 2s intersects with a column filled with 8s. The position of the 4 is at the intersection of the 8's column and the 2's row.\n\nSo for example, in example 0: 8s are in column 5. The 2s are in row 2. Their intersection is cell (2,5). But in example 0's output, that cell is 2, but the 4 is in column 4. Hmm, that's conflicting.\n\nWait, maybe the 4 is at the intersection of the 2's row and the 8's column minus one. For example, in example 0's output, the 4 is in column 4 of row 2. The 8s are in column 5. So column 5 minus 1 is column 4. Similarly, in example 1, the 8s are in column 2. The 4 is in column 1. So column 2 minus 1.\n\nIf that's the case, then in the test input, the 8s are in column 3. So their intersection with the 2's row (row 4) would be column 3-1=2. So in row 4, column 2 would be 4. But the 2s are in row 4, columns 0 and 1. How does that fit?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 4 is always to the left of the 8's column in the 2's row. For example, example 0's 4 is in column 4 (left of column 5), example 1's 4 is in column 1 (left of column 2). So for the test input's 8s in column 3, the 4 would be in column 2 of the 2's row (row 4).\n\nBut then, in example 0's output, row 2 is filled with 2s except column 4 is 4. So in the test input's output, row 4 would be filled with 2s except column 2 is 4. Then, the 8's column (3) would have 8s in all rows except row 4, where it's 8's column minus 1 (column 2) and 4. \n\nBut how does this fit with the training examples?\n\nIn example 0's input, the 2s are in row 2, columns 0 and 1. The output's row 2 has 2s in all columns except column 4 is 4. So column 4 is where the 8's column (5) minus 1.\n\nIn example 1's input, the 2s are in row 3, columns 4 and 5. The output's row 3 has 2s except column 1 is 4. The 8's column is 2, so 2-1=1. That fits.\n\nSo the pattern is: for each row that has 2s in the input, in the output, that row is filled with 2s except for the column that is one less than the 8's column. In that position, the value is 4 (8/2).\n\nSimilarly, the 8's columns are filled with 8s in all rows except the row where the 2s are, which has a 4 in the column one less than the 8's column.\n\nBut how does this apply to multiple 8s or 2s?\n\nIn example 0's input, there are two 8s in column 5. The 2s are in row 2. So in row 2, column 5-1=4 is 4, and the rest are 2s. The 8's column (5) is filled with 8s in all rows except row 2, where it's 2 (from the row's activation), but in the output, row 2, column 5 is 2.\n\nBut according to the previous idea, the 4 is in column 4, and the 8's column (5) is filled with 8s except in row 2, which has 2s. But why isn't it 8 in row 2, column 5? Maybe because the 2's row activation overrides the 8's column activation in that row.\n\nSo the rule could be:\n\n- Each 8 in the input fills its entire column with 8s, except for the row that has 2s, where instead of 8, the column to the left (8's column -1) of that row gets 4, and the rest of the row is filled with 2s.\n\n- Each 2 in the input fills its entire row with 2s, except for the column that is one left of the 8's column, which gets 4.\n\nThis seems to fit the examples. Let's check:\n\nExample 0:\n\n8s in column 5. 2s in row 2. So, the column 5 is filled with 8s except row 2. Row 2 is filled with 2s, except column 4 (5-1) gets 4.\n\nExample 0's output matches this.\n\nExample 1:\n\n8s in column 2. 2s in row 3. Column 2 is filled with 8s except row 3. Row 3 is filled with 2s except column 1 (2-1) gets 4.\n\nExample 1's output matches.\n\nTest input:\n\n8s in column 3. 2s in row 4. So, column 3 is filled with 8s except row 4. Row 4 is filled with 2s except column 2 (3-1) gets 4. The rest of the rows for column 3 are 8s. The 2s in row 4's columns 0 and 1: their row is filled with 2s except column 2 is 4. Other rows' columns 0 and 1 remain 0, unless there's another rule. \n\nWait, in example 0, the 2s are in row 2, columns 0 and 1. The output's row 2 is filled with 2s, including columns 0 and 1. So perhaps the entire row is filled with 2s except the specific column (4 in example 0) which is 4. So regardless of where the 2s are in the input row, the entire row is filled with 2s except for the designated 4.\n\nSo applying this to the test input:\n\n- The 8s in column 3 will fill all rows except row 4 with 8s in column 3. Row 4's column 3 would have 8, but according to the pattern, no. Because the 2s are in row 4, so column 3 in row 4 should be 8? Or according to the previous examples, the 4 is in column 2 (3-1), and the rest of the row is 2s. So row 4 would be [2,2,4,2,2,2], and column 3 in row 4 is 2. So column 3 in other rows is 8, but in row 4, it's 2. \n\nWait, but according to example 0, row 2's column 5 is 2. Because the 2s' row fills the entire row with 2s, except the column 4 (5-1) has 4. So in test input's row 4, the entire row would be filled with 2s except column 2 (3-1) which is 4. So row 4's output would be [2,2,4,2,2,2].\n\nThe other rows that don't have 8s or 2s in the input would be filled as follows: column 3 is filled with 8s except row 4, where it's 2. Rows 0 and 1 already have 8s in column 3, so they remain. Rows 2,3,5 would have 8 in column 3. Row 4 has 2 in column 3. The rest of the cells in rows 0,1,2,3,5 would be 0 except column 3. But wait, what about the other columns?\n\nAh, no. In example 0, the 8s are only in column 5. The output has column 5 filled with 8s except row 2. So for the test input, the output would have column 3 filled with 8s except row 4. The rest of the cells (except where row 4 is filled with 2s and column 3) would remain 0.\n\nBut looking at example 0's output, the third row (index 2) is filled with 2s, but in the input, the 2s were only in columns 0 and 1. So the rule must be that any row with 2s in the input is completely filled with 2s except for the specific column where 4 is placed.\n\nSo applying this to the test input:\n\nThe output should look like:\n\nRows 0 and 1: same as input (0s except column 3 is 8).\n\nRows 2,3: all 0s except column 3 is 8.\n\nRow 4: filled with 2s except column 2 is 4.\n\nRow 5: all 0s except column 3 is 8.\n\nSo the output would be:\n\n[0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0]\n[0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0]\n[0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0]\n[0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0]\n[2, 2, 4, 2, 2, 2]\n[0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0]\n\nBut let's check example 1's output. The input 2s are in row 3, columns 4 and 5. The output's row 3 is [2,4,2,2,2,2]. So the entire row is filled with 2s except column 1 (8's column -1) which is 4. So even though the input's 2s were in columns 4 and 5, the entire row is filled with 2s. Hence, the same applies to the test input: row 4 will be filled with 2s except column 2 (8's column -1) which is 4.\n\nTherefore, the test input's output should be as I wrote above.",

        "cot_2": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. So, looking at the training examples.\n\nIn Example 0, the input has a 8 in the fifth position of the first two rows. Then there's a row with two 2s. The output seems to expand those elements. The output rows have 8s in the fifth column for the first two rows, then the third row becomes a line with 2s and a 4. Then the following rows also have 8s in the fifth column. Wait, how does that happen?\n\nSimilarly, in Example 1, the input has 8s in the second column of the first two rows. The output makes those columns have 8s in more rows, and the fourth row (where the input had 2s) becomes a row with 2s and a 4. Then the rows below and above have the 8s again.\n\nSo maybe the pattern is that for each non-zero number in the input, we create a cross shape (vertical and horizontal) around it in the output. The non-zero numbers in the input might be acting as centers. Then, in the cross, the center value is doubled. Wait, let's check:\n\nIn Example 0, the input has 8s in (0,4) and (1,4). Then the output has 8s in the same columns, but rows 0,1,3,4,5. So vertically, they are extended. Also, the row with 2s (row 2) in the input is expanded horizontally. The output row 2 has all 2s except the fourth element is 4 (which is 2*2). So maybe the cross is formed: for each cell in input that has a non-zero value, in the output, the same row is filled with that value, except the original position which is doubled. Similarly, the same column is filled with the value, except the original position which is doubled. But wait, how does the cross combine when multiple values are present?\n\nWait, let's see Example 0 input. The first two rows have 8 in column 4. The third row has 2s in columns 0 and 1. The output for row 2 is [2,2,2,2,4,2]. So columns 0-3 and 5 are 2, column 4 is 4. That might be because the original 2s are in columns 0 and 1. Wait, but the output row 2 has 2s in all columns except column 4. Hmm. Maybe the original 2s in row 2, columns 0 and 1. So for each cell with a value, in the output, the entire row of that cell is filled with the value, and the entire column is filled with the value. But when cells overlap, perhaps they add up? Or maybe the maximum?\n\nWait, let's look at the output row 2 in Example 0. The original input row 2 has two 2s. In the output, the entire row is filled with 2s except column 4, which is 4. Column 4 in the input has 8s in rows 0 and 1. So maybe the column 4 is filled with 8s except where there's another value. But in row 2, column 4, the output is 4, which is 2+2. Wait, but 2 is from the row, and 8 from the column. Wait, maybe when a cell is in both a row and a column of a non-zero input, their values are added.\n\nWait, in Example 0, input has 8s in column 4 (rows 0 and 1) and 2s in row 2 (columns 0 and 1). So in the output, each cell is the sum of any row or column contributions from the input.\n\nFor example, in row 0, column 4: original input has 8. So in the output, all cells in row 0 and column 4 would be affected. So for row 0, all columns would get 8 except the original cell (0,4) which would be 8 + 8 (since it's both in row 0 and column 4) but wait, no. The original input for row 0, column 4 is 8. Then, in the output, every cell in row 0 should have 8, except maybe where other columns contribute. Wait, maybe for each non-zero input cell, we spread its value to all cells in the same row and column. Then, the output cell is the sum of all such contributions. So for example, in the input:\n\nIf a cell (i,j) has value v, then in the output, every cell in row i and column j gets v added. But the original cell (i,j) would be v (from itself) plus any others. Wait, but how?\n\nWait, in Example 0's input, the cell (0,4) is 8. So, according to this idea, in the output, all cells in row 0 and column 4 would have 8 added. But then, for example, cell (0,0) would be 8 (from row 0) and cell (0,4) would be 8 (from row 0 and column 4). But in the output of Example 0, the first row is all 0 except the fifth element (8). Wait, no. Wait, Example 0's output for row 0 is [0,0,0,0,8,0]. That's the same as input. So maybe this approach is wrong.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the non-zero elements in the input are the centers of cross shapes in the output. For each non-zero element in the input, the output has a cross (same row and column) filled with that element's value. But if multiple crosses overlap, their values are added.\n\nWait, let's take Example 0's input. The 8s in row 0 and 1, column 4. For each of these, their cross is the entire row and column. So in the output, rows 0 and 1, columns 4 would have 8s in their entire rows and columns. But when you look at the output, rows 0 and 1 are [0,0,0,0,8,0], same as input. So that's not matching. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe the pattern is different. Let's look at the output. In Example 0's output, the third row (index 2) is [2,2,2,2,4,2]. The input's third row (index 2) has [2,2,0,0,0,0]. So perhaps the output's row 2 is filled with 2s except the column where 8s are present (column 4), which is 4. So 2 (from row) plus 8 (from column) would be 10, but 4 is 2+2. Hmm. Not matching. Or maybe multiplied? 2 and 8, but 2*2=4. Wait, maybe when a cell is in both a row and a column of a non-zero input, the value is the sum of the row's value and column's value, but that doesn't add up here. Alternatively, it's the product.\n\nWait in row 2, column 4 of Example 0's output is 4. If the row's original value is 2 (from the input's row 2, columns 0 and 1) and the column's original value is 8 (from input rows 0 and 1, column 4), then 2+8=10, which is not 4. So that doesn't fit. But 2*2 is 4. Wait, maybe the original value is added for each occurrence. For example, the input's row 2 has two 2s. So maybe each 2 in the input contributes to the cross. So for each 2 in row 2, columns 0 and 1, we add 2 to the entire row and column. So in row 2, all cells would get 2 (from each 2 in the row) multiplied by the number of 2s in that row? Or perhaps each 2 in the row adds to the entire row's output. Wait, in input row 2, there are two 2s. In output row 2, each cell (except column 4) is 2. But column 4 is 4, which is 2*2. Hmm. Maybe each non-zero cell in the input contributes to the same row and column in the output, and when multiple contributions overlap, they multiply?\n\nAlternatively, the output is created by for each non-zero cell in the input, adding 1 to the entire row and column, and then multiplying by the cell's value. But not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the output is constructed by, for each cell (i,j) in the output, sum all the input values that are in row i or column j. Then, if the sum is non-zero, it's placed there. But let's test that.\n\nIn Example 0's input:\n\nRow 0, column 4 has 8. So for output cell (0,4), it's in row 0 and column 4, so sum all input cells in row 0 (which has 8) and column 4 (which has 8 in row 0 and 1). So sum would be 8 (from row 0) + 8 (from column 4) + ... Wait, this approach might not work.\n\nAlternatively, for each output cell (i,j), the value is the sum of all input cells in row i plus the sum of all input cells in column j. So:\n\nTake Example 0's input:\n\nRow 0: sum is 8.\n\nColumn 4: sum is 8+8 =16.\n\nSo output cell (0,4) would be 8 (row sum) + 16 (column sum) =24? But the output shows 8. So that's not matching.\n\nHmm, maybe not. Let's think differently.\n\nLooking at Example 0's output:\n\nThe input has 8s in rows 0 and 1, column 4, and 2s in row 2, columns 0 and 1.\n\nThe output's first two rows are same as input. Then row 2 is filled with 2s and a 4. Then rows 3,4,5 have 8s in column 4.\n\nWait, perhaps the output is formed by creating a cross for each non-zero input cell. For each input cell (i,j) with value v:\n\n- All cells in row i of the output are set to v, except where other crosses are present.\n\n- All cells in column j of the output are set to v, except where other crosses are present.\n\nBut when a cell is in both a row and column of different input cells, their values are added.\n\nBut in Example 0, the output row 2 is filled with 2s (from input row 2's 2s), except column 4 which is 4. The 4 could be 2 (from row 2) plus 8 (from column 4's input) but 2+8=10, not 4. So that doesn't add up. Alternatively, maybe it's the product of the row and column contributions. For example, if a cell is in the cross of a row from a 2 and a column from an 8, then 2*8=16? But in the output, it's 4. So that's not matching.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps when a cell is part of multiple crosses (rows and columns from different input cells), the values are combined by taking the sum but divided by some factor. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each non-zero input cell causes its entire row and column in the output to be filled with that value, and overlapping cells sum their values. Then, for example, in Example 0:\n\nThe 8 in (0,4) causes row 0 and column 4 to be filled with 8.\n\nThe 8 in (1,4) causes row 1 and column 4 to be filled with 8.\n\nThe 2 in (2,0) causes row 2 and column 0 to be filled with 2.\n\nThe 2 in (2,1) causes row 2 and column 1 to be filled with 2.\n\nSo, let's see what that would look like:\n\nRow 0 (from (0,4)): all 8s.\n\nRow 1 (from (1,4)): all 8s.\n\nColumn 4 (from (0,4) and (1,4)): all 8s.\n\nRow 2 (from (2,0) and (2,1)): filled with 2s.\n\nColumns 0 and 1 (from (2,0) and (2,1)): filled with 2s.\n\nBut in the output, row 0 is [0,0,0,0,8,0], which is the same as input. So that's conflicting. Because according to this logic, row 0 should be all 8s.\n\nHmm, maybe the initial input is a mask. Only the non-zero cells in the input are considered, and their rows and columns are filled with their values. But then, how to explain the output's first row being the same as the input's first row?\n\nWait, looking back at the output for Example 0. The input has 8s in rows 0 and 1, column 4. The output's rows 0 and 1 are the same as input, but rows 3,4,5 have 8s in column 4. So maybe the 8s in the input cause their column to be filled in all rows except the original rows? Or perhaps the original rows are kept as is, but the column is filled in other rows. So, for each non-zero cell (i,j) in the input, the output's column j is filled with the cell's value for all rows except row i. And the row i is filled with the cell's value except column j. Then, where the row and column intersect, the value is doubled.\n\nWait, let's try this with Example 0's input:\n\nFor cell (0,4) with 8:\n\n- Fill row 0 with 8 except column 4 (which remains 8). So row 0 becomes [8,8,8,8,8,8] but column 4 is 8, so maybe it's the same as input. Hmm, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, when you process (0,4), you set all cells in column 4 (except row 0) to 8. And set all cells in row 0 (except column 4) to 8. But in the input, row 0 has 8 in column 4 and 0 elsewhere. So processing (0,4) would set row 0's other columns to 8 and column 4's other rows to 8.\n\nBut in the output, row 0's columns are 0 except 8 in column 4. So that doesn't fit. So maybe this approach is wrong.\n\nAnother angle: looking at the output of the training examples. In both examples, the output seems to form a kind of cross for each non-zero input cell, but with some overlapping.\n\nIn Example 1's input, the 8s are in column 1, rows 0 and 1. The output has 8s in column 1 for all rows except perhaps rows 3. Wait, looking at the output of Example 1:\n\nRows 0,1,2,4,5 of column 1 are 8, and row 3 has 4 (from 2 and 2?) in column 1. Wait, no. The output's row 3 is [2,4,2,2,2,2]. So column 1 here is 4. The input's row 3 had 2s in columns 4 and 5. So processing those 2s would create their own rows and columns. So the 2s in row 3, columns 4 and 5 would fill row 3 with 2s except columns 4 and 5, and fill columns 4 and 5 with 2s except row 3. But in the output, row 3 is [2,4,2,2,2,2]. So columns 0,2,3,5 are 2. Column 1 is 4, and column 4 is 2. So maybe column 1's 4 comes from 8 (from the input's column 1) plus 2 (from row 3's 2s) but 8+2=10, not 4. Alternatively, 8 and 2 multiplied gives 16, which is not 4 either.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Maybe there's another pattern.\n\nLooking at the positions of non-zero elements in the input and output:\n\nIn Example 0's input:\n\nNon-zero cells are:\n\n(0,4) = 8\n\n(1,4) =8\n\n(2,0)=2\n\n(2,1)=2\n\nThe output's non-zero cells are:\n\nIn rows 0 and 1, column 4: 8s.\n\nRow 2: all except column 4 have 2, column 4 has 4.\n\nRows 3-5: column 4 has 8s.\n\nSo for each 8 in the input's column 4, the output fills column 4 with 8s in all rows except row 2 (which has 4). But row 2 has 2s from the input's row 2. So perhaps the 8s in the column and the 2s in the row intersect at (2,4) to create 4 (2*2=4?), but why 4?\n\nWait, maybe the value at the intersection is the sum of the row and column values. But 2 (from row) and 8 (from column) would sum to 10, which is not 4. So that's not it.\n\nAlternatively, the intersection is the product divided by something. 2*8=16, but no.\n\nAlternatively, the intersection cell is the sum of the input's row and column values. For example, in Example 0's output (2,4), the row comes from the input's row 2 (sum of 2+2=4?), and column 4 (sum of 8+8=16). Then 4+16=20? No, but the value is 4.\n\nHmm, this is confusing. Maybe the output is generated by:\n\nFor each non-zero cell in the input, create a cross (row and column) filled with that value. When two crosses overlap, the value is the sum of the overlapping values.\n\nBut let's try this with Example 0.\n\nInput cells (0,4)=8 and (1,4)=8 create crosses for their rows and columns. Then (2,0)=2 and (2,1)=2 create crosses for their rows and columns.\n\nSo for (0,4)=8:\n\n- Row 0 filled with 8.\n\n- Column 4 filled with 8.\n\nFor (1,4)=8:\n\n- Row 1 filled with 8.\n\n- Column 4 filled with 8 again (so total 8+8=16?).\n\nFor (2,0)=2:\n\n- Row 2 filled with 2.\n\n- Column 0 filled with 2.\n\nFor (2,1)=2:\n\n- Row 2 filled with 2 again (so 2+2=4?).\n\n- Column 1 filled with 2.\n\nSo, applying this:\n\nRow 0: filled with 8 (from (0,4)), so all cells are 8. But the output row 0 is [0,0,0,0,8,0]. That doesn't match. So maybe the initial rows are not filled. Or perhaps the input's non-zero cells are preserved, and the crosses are added around them.\n\nAlternatively, the output is built by:\n\nFor each non-zero cell in the input, in the output:\n\n- The entire row of that cell is filled with the cell's value, except the original position which remains the same.\n\n- The entire column of that cell is filled with the cell's value, except the original position which remains the same.\n\nWait, let's test this.\n\nFor Example 0's (0,4)=8:\n\n- Fill row 0 with 8 except column 4.\n\n- Fill column 4 with 8 except row 0.\n\nSimilarly for (1,4)=8:\n\n- Fill row 1 with 8 except column 4.\n\n- Fill column 4 with 8 except row 1.\n\nSo row 0 would have 8s except column 4 (original 8), leading to [8,8,8,8,8,8] but since column 4 is kept as 8, maybe that's not the case. No, this approach doesn't explain the output.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is formed by \"spreading\" the non-zero values in the input. For each non-zero cell (i,j) in the input, the output's entire row i and column j are filled with the cell's value. Then, the original cell's value is doubled.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nExample 0's input has (0,4)=8. So output row 0 is all 8s, column 4 is all 8s, and (0,4) is 8*2=16. But the output row 0 is [0,0,0,0,8,0]. So that doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. Maybe the pattern is to take each non-zero input cell and then mirror it both horizontally and vertically, adding it to the output. Like, for each cell (i,j), in the output, row i and column j are filled with the value, and the cell itself is doubled.\n\nBut in Example 0's output, row 0's column 4 is 8 (same as input), not doubled. So that's conflicting.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is built such that each non-zero cell in the input propagates its value to all cells in its row and column, but the original cell's value is the sum of all contributions. For example, if a cell (i,j) has value v, then in the output, every cell in row i and column j gets v added. Then, (i,j) gets v added twice (once for row, once for column). But in that case, the output cell would be v + sum of other contributions.\n\nBut let's test this with Example 0's input:\n\nOriginal input:\n\nRow 0: [0,0,0,0,8,0]\n\nRow 1: [0,0,0,0,8,0]\n\nRow 2: [2,2,0,0,0,0]\n\nSo, the non-zero cells are (0,4)=8, (1,4)=8, (2,0)=2, (2,1)=2.\n\nSo for each of these:\n\n- (0,4) adds 8 to all cells in row 0 and column 4.\n\n- (1,4) adds 8 to all cells in row 1 and column 4.\n\n- (2,0) adds 2 to all cells in row 2 and column 0.\n\n- (2,1) adds 2 to all cells in row 2 and column 1.\n\nSo let's compute the output cell (0,4):\n\n- From (0,4): adds 8 (row) and 8 (column) \u2192 total 16. But the input has 8 here. So output would be 8 (original) + 8 (row) +8 (column) =24? But in the output, it's 8. So that's not matching.\n\nHmm. This is getting really tricky. Maybe I need to look for another pattern.\n\nLooking at Example 0's output:\n\nThe first two rows are the same as the input. Then row 2 is filled with 2s except column 4, which is 4. Then rows 3-5 are filled with 8s in column 4.\n\nSo maybe the non-zero elements in the input cause their entire columns (except their own rows) to be filled with their value. And their entire rows (except their own columns) to be filled with their value. And the intersection cell (same row and column) is the sum.\n\nFor example, cell (0,4)=8:\n\n- All rows except row 0 in column 4 are set to 8.\n\n- All columns except column 4 in row 0 are set to 8.\n\nBut in the output, row 0 is same as input, which has 0s except column 4. So this approach doesn't work.\n\nWait, perhaps the pattern is that each non-zero input cell causes the entire row and column to be filled with the same value, but the original cell remains. And if multiple cells affect the same position, their values are summed.\n\nFor example, in Example 0:\n\nThe 8 in (0,4) causes row 0 to be filled with 8s, and column 4 to be filled with 8s.\n\nBut row 0 is already [0,0,0,0,8,0], but according to this, it should be [8,8,8,8,8,8]. Which doesn't match the output. So this can't be right.\n\nAlternative approach: Maybe the output is generated by creating a cross for each non-zero cell, where the cross consists of the same row and column, filled with the cell's value. Then, for each cross, the original cell is doubled. And when crosses overlap, the values are added.\n\nSo, for cell (0,4)=8:\n\n- Fill row 0 and column 4 with 8.\n\n- Cell (0,4) is 8*2=16.\n\nBut in the output, cell (0,4) is 8. So that's not matching.\n\nBut perhaps the original cell is kept, and the cross is filled. So for cell (0,4)=8:\n\n- All cells in row 0 and column 4, except (0,4) itself, are set to 8.\n\nBut in the output, row 0 has [0,0,0,0,8,0]. Which would mean that the other cells in row 0 are not set to 8. So that's not it.\n\nWait, in Example 0's output, rows 3,4,5 have 8 in column 4. Which suggests that the 8s in column 4 (from input) are propagated to those rows. So maybe for each non-zero cell (i,j), in the output, the column j is filled with the value below and above the original cell. Like, the column is filled with the value in all rows except the original row(s).\n\nSo for example, input (0,4)=8 and (1,4)=8. The column 4 is filled with 8 in rows 2,3,4,5. But in the output, column 4 of rows 0 and 1 are 8 (same as input), and rows 3,4,5 are 8. So that's possible. Then, for the row 2's 2s, their columns 0 and 1 are filled with 2 in all rows except row 2. But the output's row 2's columns 0 and 1 are 2. Hmm. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, for each non-zero cell (i,j) with value v:\n\n- The entire column j is filled with v, except for the rows that have non-zero cells in column j.\n\nFor example, in Example 0's column 4 has 8s in rows 0 and 1. So the output column 4 is filled with 8 except for rows 0 and 1. But in the output, column 4 has 8 in rows 0,1,3,4,5 and 4 in row 2. So that's not matching.\n\nAlternatively, the output's column j is filled with the maximum value from the input's column j, and the rows are filled with the maximum value from the input's rows. But in Example 0's row 2, the input has 2s, so output row 2 is filled with 2s. Column 4's max is 8, so filled with 8. But in the output's row 2, column 4 is 4, which is 2*2. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the output for each cell is the product of the sum of the row in the input and the sum of the column in the input. For example, in Example 0's row 2: sum is 4 (2+2+0+0+0+0). Column 4's sum is 16 (8+8+0+0+0+0). So 4 * 16 = 64. But the output row 2 has 2s and a 4. So that's not matching.\n\nAnother idea: For each non-zero cell in the input, the output has a plus sign (+) shape around it, extending one cell in each direction. And the cell itself is multiplied by 2. But the examples don't seem to support this.\n\nAlternatively, the output is created by expanding each non-zero cell into a 3x3 cross (current cell and adjacent cells) but scaled to the entire grid. But given the examples are 6x6, this seems unlikely.\n\nWait, perhaps the output is generated by the following steps:\n\n1. For each non-zero cell in the input, add its value to all cells in the same row and column in the output.\n\n2. For each cell in the output, if it was part of any row or column addition, keep the sum. The original input cells are preserved.\n\nBut let's test this with Example 0.\n\nInput (0,4)=8. So add 8 to all cells in row 0 and column 4 of the output.\n\nSimilarly for (1,4)=8: add 8 to row 1 and column 4.\n\nFor (2,0)=2: add 2 to row 2 and column 0.\n\nFor (2,1)=2: add 2 to row 2 and column 1.\n\nSo the output would be:\n\nRow 0: each cell except column 4 gets 8 added (from row 0), and column 4 gets 8 added (from cell (0,4) and (1,4) columns). But original row 0 is [0,0,0,0,8,0].\n\nSo for row 0, column 4: original 8 + 8 (from row 0's 8) + 8 (from column 4's 8) \u2192 24? But in the output, it's 8. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, the original cells are not preserved; instead, the sum is just the additions from the rows and columns.\n\nFor example, cell (0,4) would be 8 (from row 0's cell) + 8 (from column 4's cell) \u2192 16. But the output has 8. So this approach is wrong.\n\nI'm stuck. Maybe I need to think of the output as a combination of vertical and horizontal expansions.\n\nLooking at Example 0's output:\n\nThe 8s from the input's column 4 are propagated down to the bottom rows (3,4,5) in column 4.\n\nThe 2s from input's row 2 are propagated across the entire row 2, but column 4 has 4.\n\nSimilarly, in Example 1's output:\n\nThe 8s from column 1 are propagated to rows 2,4,5 in column 1.\n\nThe 2s from row 3's columns 4 and 5 are propagated to the entire row 3, and columns 4 and 5.\n\nThe intersection of row 3 and column 1 has 4 (which is 2+2?), but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, maybe the pattern is:\n\nFor each non-zero cell in the input, in the output:\n\n- The entire row is filled with the cell's value.\n\n- The entire column is filled with the cell's value.\n\nBut when a cell is in both a row and column of different non-zero input cells, the values are summed.\n\nBut in Example 0's row 2, column 4: sum of 2 (from row 2's 2s) and 8 (from column 4's 8s) \u2192 10. But the output is 4. So that's not matching.\n\nAlternatively, when a cell is in the row and column of different input cells, their values are multiplied. So 2 * 8 = 16. But output is 4. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the cell's value is the product of the number of non-zero cells in its row and column. For example, in Example 0's row 2 has two 2s, and column 4 has two 8s. 2 * 2 =4. That's exactly the value in (2,4). Similarly, in Example 1's row 3, column 1: the input's row 3 has two 2s, and column 1 has two 8s. 2 *2 =4. Which matches the output.\n\nSo the pattern could be:\n\nFor each cell (i,j) in the output:\n\nIf the cell is in a row that has non-zero cells in the input, or a column that has non-zero cells in the input:\n\nThe value is the product of the count of non-zero cells in the input's row i and the count of non-zero cells in the input's column j.\n\nOtherwise, 0.\n\nWait, let's test this:\n\nExample 0's row 2 has two non-zero cells (columns 0 and 1), and column 4 has two non-zero cells (rows 0 and 1).\n\nSo cell (2,4) would be 2 (row count) * 2 (column count) =4, which matches the output.\n\nIn Example 1's input:\n\nRow 3 has two non-zero cells (columns 4 and 5).\n\nColumn 1 has two non-zero cells (rows 0 and 1).\n\nSo cell (3,1) would be 2 *2=4, which matches the output.\n\nOther cells:\n\nIn Example 0's row 0, column 4:\n\nRow 0 has one non-zero cell (column 4).\n\nColumn 4 has two non-zero cells (rows 0 and 1).\n\nSo cell (0,4) would be 1*2=2. But in the output, it's 8. So this doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. So perhaps this isn't the right pattern.\n\nAlternative approach: For each cell (i,j) in the output:\n\nIf the input's row i has at least one non-zero, then set output cell to the sum of non-zero values in row i.\n\nSimilarly, if column j has non-zero values, set output cell to sum of column j's non-zero values.\n\nBut if a cell is in both a non-zero row and column, sum both sums?\n\nExample 0's row 0 sum is 8, column 4 sum is 16. So cell (0,4) would be 8+16=24. Not matching output.\n\nAlternatively, if a cell is in a non-zero row, set to row sum; if in non-zero column, set to column sum. Overlapping cells get row sum + column sum.\n\nBut again, this leads to numbers higher than output.\n\nAnother thought: The output's value for cell (i,j) is the number of non-zero cells in row i of the input multiplied by the number of non-zero cells in column j of the input. Then, multiply by the value of the non-zero cells if they are the same, but that's unclear.\n\nIn Example 0's cell (2,4):\n\nRow 2 has two non-zero cells. Column 4 has two non-zero cells. 2 * 2 =4. Which matches the output. In Example 1's cell (3,1): row 3 has two, column 1 has two. 4. Which matches.\n\nBut what about other cells? For example, cell (0,4) in Example 0: row 0 has one, column 4 has two. 1*2=2. But output is 8. So this doesn't fit unless multiplied by some value.\n\nBut the 8 in the input's (0,4) is not considered here. So maybe this is part of the pattern.\n\nWait, perhaps for each cell (i,j) in the output:\n\nThe value is (number of non-zero cells in input row i) * (number of non-zero cells in input column j) * (sum of all non-zero values in input) / some factor.\n\nBut this seems complicated.\n\nAlternatively, the output cell (i,j) is the product of the count of non-zero cells in row i and column j of the input. Then, multiplied by a base value. For example, in Example 0, the sum of all non-zero values is 8+8+2+2=20. 20/(2*2) =5, but 4 is the output cell (2,4). Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the product of the counts and the average value. But this also doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, each non-zero cell in the input contributes to the output by adding 1 to all cells in its row and column. The output cell is the count of such contributions, multiplied by the original cell's value. But this is unclear.\n\nWait, in Example 0, the output cell (2,4) is 4. What contributes to this cell?\n\nThe non-zero cells in input are:\n\n(0,4): contributes to row 0 and column 4. But cell (2,4) is in column 4, so this cell is part of column 4's contribution from (0,4) and (1,4).\n\n(1,4): also contributes to column 4.\n\n(2,0) and (2,1): contribute to row 2.\n\nSo cell (2,4) is in row 2 (from (2,0) and (2,1)) and column 4 (from (0,4) and (1,4)). So there are 2 contributions from row and 2 from column, total 4. So 4 multiplied by some base value. But what base value? In Example 0's input, the non-zero cells are 8,8,2,2. So average is (8+8+2+2)/4=5. 4*5=20, which is not 4.\n\nAlternatively, base value is the sum of the values in the row and column contributions. For example, for row contributions: each non-zero cell in row i adds its value to all cells in row i. Similarly for columns. So cell (2,4) would be sum of all row 2's non-zero cells (2+2=4) plus sum of column 4's non-zero cells (8+8=16) \u2192 20. But output is 4. So this isn't matching.\n\nI'm really stuck. Maybe I need to look for a different pattern.\n\nLooking at the outputs:\n\nIn both examples, the output has certain rows and columns filled with the same values as the input's non-zero cells, and at the intersection of such rows and columns, the value is the product of the row's and column's values divided by something.\n\nFor example, in Example 0's cell (2,4): row 2 is filled with 2s (from input's row 2's 2s), and column 4 is filled with 8s (from input's column 4's 8s). The intersection is 2*8/ something. 2*8=16. But output is 4. So 16/4=4. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, 2 + 8 = 10, but output is 4. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAnother idea: For each non-zero cell in the input, the output's entire row is filled with the cell's value, and the entire column is filled with the cell's value. If a cell is in both a filled row and column, the value is the sum of the row's value and the column's value.\n\nFor example:\n\nInput cell (0,4)=8: fill row 0 with 8 and column 4 with 8. So cell (0,4) is 8+8=16, but output is 8. So no.\n\nAlternatively, if a cell is in multiple rows or columns, take the maximum value. But in Example 0's cell (2,4), the row is 2 and column is 8. Max is 8. But output is 4. So that's not it.\n\nI think I'm missing something. Maybe the pattern is that for each non-zero cell (i,j) in the input:\n\n- The output's row i is filled with the value of (i,j).\n\n- The output's column j is filled with the value of (i,j).\n\n- The cell (i,j) in the output is the original value multiplied by the number of non-zero cells in its row and column.\n\nBut not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is built by first creating a grid of zeros. Then, for each non-zero cell in the input, add its value to all cells in the same row and column. Then, for each cell in the output, if it was affected by exactly one row or column, set it to that value. If affected by both, set it to the product.\n\nIn Example 0's cell (2,4):\n\n- Affected by row 2 (from input's 2s) and column 4 (from input's 8s). So 2 *8=16. But output is 4. Doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, sum the values from each contribution. For cell (2,4): 2 (from row 2) +8 (from column 4) =10. Output is 4. No.\n\nI think I need to give up and look for another approach.\n\nWait, maybe the output is formed by creating a cross for each non-zero cell in the input. The cross consists of the same row and column as the cell. The value in the cross is the same as the original cell's value. Then, the cell where multiple crosses intersect is the sum of the original cells' values.\n\nFor example, in Example 0:\n\n- The 8s in column 4 (rows 0 and 1) create crosses filling their rows and columns. So rows 0 and 1 have 8s in all columns, and column 4 has 8s in all rows.\n\n- The 2s in row 2 (columns 0 and 1) create crosses filling their rows and columns. So row 2 has 2s in all columns, and columns 0 and 1 have 2s in all rows.\n\nBut this would result in overlaps:\n\nIn row 0, columns 0 and 1 would be 2 (from columns 0 and 1) and 8 (from row 0). Which sum to 10. But the output's row 0 is [0,0,0,0,8,0]. So this isn't the case.\n\nAlternatively, when crosses overlap, the maximum value is taken. But in row 0, columns 0 and 1 would have 8 (from row 0) and 2 (from columns 0 and 1). So max is 8. But output has 0. So this is not correct.\n\nI'm really stuck. Maybe I should look for a different pattern, like the output is the input matrix plus some transformation.\n\nIn Example 0's output, the third row (index 2) is filled with 2s except column 4, which is 4. The input's third row has 2s in columns 0 and 1. So perhaps the output's row 2 is filled with 2s, and column 4 is filled with 8s. But the intersection (2,4) is 2 +8 =10, but the output is 4. So that's not it.\n\nAlternatively, the output's row 2 is filled with 2s, and column 4 is filled with 8s. The intersection is 2 multiplied by 8 divided by 4 =4. So 8*2=16, divided by 4=4. But why 4?\n\nMaybe the intersection cell is the product of the row's value and column's value, divided by some factor. For example, if row value is 2 and column value is 8, then 2 *8 /4 =4. But why divide by 4? Not sure.\n\nAnother Idea:\n\nLooking at the outputs, the number of non-zero rows and columns in the input corresponds to the number of filled rows and columns in the output.\n\nIn Example 0, the input has non-zero rows 0,1,2. The output has non-zero rows 0,1,2,3,4,5. Similarly for columns.\n\nWait, the input's non-zero columns are 4,0,1 (from the 8s in column 4 and 2s in 0,1). The output's non-zero columns are 4,0,1,2,3,5 (from row 2 in example 0's output).\n\nSo perhaps each non-zero cell in the input causes its row and column to be filled with its value in the output, but the original cell's value is preserved. So for example, cell (0,4)=8: fill row 0 and column 4 with 8. But the output row 0 is [0,0,0,0,8,0]. So the row 0 isn't filled. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, the output's row i is filled with the value of the first non-zero cell in row i of the input. Similarly for columns.\n\nIn Example 0, row 0 has 8, so output row 0 is filled with 8. But output row 0 is [0,0,0,0,8,0]. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, the output's row i is filled with the sum of the non-zero values in row i of the input. Similarly for columns. But example 0's row 0 sum is 8. So output row 0 would be 8s. But output is [0,0,0,0,8,0]. So no.\n\nThis is really challenging. Given the time I've spent and the need to provide an answer, perhaps I should look for a pattern in the output's structure.\n\nIn both training examples:\n\n- The output has certain rows and columns filled with the input's non-zero values, creating a sort of cross.\n\n- The intersection of a filled row and column has a value that is the sum of the row's and column's values divided by two. Or perhaps the product of the count of non-zero cells in the row and column.\n\nIn Example 0's row 2, column 4: the row is filled with 2s (from two 2s), column with 8s (from two 8s). 2+2 +8+8=20. But the output is 4. Not sure.\n\nWait, maybe the output cell is the number of non-zero cells in the row multiplied by the number in the row plus the number of non-zero cells in the column multiplied by the number in the column. For example, in Example 0's (2,4):\n\nRow 2 has two 2s: 2*2=4.\n\nColumn 4 has two 8s: 2*8=16.\n\nSum: 4+16=20. Not 4.\n\nAlternatively, product: 4*16=64. Not matching.\n\nAlternatively, the minimum of the two: 4 and 16 \u21924. Which matches. But in Example 1's (3,1):\n\nRow 3 has two 2s: 2*2=4.\n\nColumn 1 has two 8s: 2*8=16.\n\nMinimum is 4. Which matches the output.\n\nIn Example 0's (0,4):\n\nRow 0 has one 8: 1*8=8.\n\nColumn 4 has two 8s:2*8=16.\n\nMinimum is 8. Which matches the output's 8.\n\nIn Example 0's (2,0):\n\nRow 2 has two 2s: 2*2=4.\n\nColumn 0 has two 2s:2*2=4.\n\nMinimum is 4. But output's (2,0) is 2. So that's not matching.\n\nHmm, so this doesn't fit all cases.\n\nBut wait, maybe it's the product of the count of non-zero cells in the row and column, multiplied by the value of the cell. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the output cell is the product of the number of non-zero cells in the row and the value of those cells. For example, in Example 0's row 2 has two 2s: 2*2=4. So all cells in row 2 would be 4. But the output has 2s in row 2 except column 4 which is 4. So perhaps the row is filled with 2*2=4 divided by 2? No.\n\nThis is getting too time-consuming. Given the examples, perhaps the pattern is:\n\nFor each non-zero cell in the input, the corresponding row and column in the output are filled with the cell's value. Where a row and column intersect (i.e., the cell's position), the value is doubled.\n\nBut when multiple cells contribute to the same row or column, their values are added.\n\nLet's test this:\n\nExample 0's input has (0,4)=8. So row 0 and column 4 filled with 8. Cell (0,4) is 8*2=16. But output is 8. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, the cell's value is preserved, and the row and column are filled with the same value. But in that case, row 0 would be filled with 8s. But output isn't like that.\n\nGiven the time I've spent, perhaps I should look at the test input and see what the expected output would be based on the training examples.\n\nTest input:\n\n[0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0]\n\n[0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0]\n\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n[2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nNon-zero cells:\n\nRows 0 and 1, column 3: 8 each.\n\nRow 4, columns 0 and 1: 2 each.\n\nFollowing the pattern from the examples:\n\nIn the output, the 8s in column 3 (rows 0 and 1) would cause column 3 to be filled with 8s in all rows except rows 0 and 1, where they are preserved. Wait, but in Example 0, the 8s in column 4 caused the column to be filled in rows 3,4,5.\n\nAlternatively, the 8s in column 3 would be filled in all rows below and above. Similarly, the 2s in row 4 would fill the entire row 4 with 2s except column 3 (which is 8), and their columns 0 and 1 would be filled with 2s in all rows except row 4.\n\nSo the output would have:\n\nRows 0 and 1: same as input, [0,0,0,8,0,0].\n\nRow 4: [2,2,2, 4, 2, 2] (since column 3 is 8, intersection is 2+8=10? Or 2*2=4?).\n\nColumns 0 and 1 filled with 2s in all rows except row 4.\n\nColumn 3 filled with 8s in all rows except rows 0 and 1.\n\nAdditionally, the rows for the 8s (0 and 1) would have their columns filled with 8s? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, following Example 0 and 1's pattern:\n\nThe output will have:\n\n- The rows with 8s (0 and 1) will remain the same.\n\n- The columns with 8s (3) will have 8s in all rows except perhaps row 4 (where the 2s are).\n\n- The rows with 2s (4) will be filled with 2s except column 3, which will be 4.\n\n- The columns with 2s (0 and 1) will be filled with 2s in all rows except row 4.\n\nSo the output would look like:\n\nRow 0: [0,0,0,8,0,0]\n\nRow 1: [0,0,0,8,0,0]\n\nRow 2: [2,2,0,8,0,0]\n\nRow 3: [2,2,0,8,0,0]\n\nRow 4: [2,2,2,4,2,2]\n\nRow 5: [2,2,0,8,0,0]\n\nWait, but how does this match the structure of the training examples? For instance, in Example 0, the output's rows 3-5 have 8s in column 4. Similarly, the test input's column 3 would have 8s in rows 2,3,5.\n\nBut the row 4 has 2s in columns 0 and 1, so their columns 0 and 1 would be filled with 2s in all rows except row 4. So rows 0,1,2,3,5 of columns 0 and 1 would be 2s. Row 4's columns 0 and 1 are 2s, but row 4's other columns are filled with 2s except column 3, which is 4.\n\nPutting this all together, the test output would be:\n\nRows 0 and 1: same as input.\n\nRow 2: [2,2,0,8,0,0]\n\nRow 3: [2,2,0,8,0,0]\n\nRow 4: [2,2,2,4,2,2]\n\nRow 5: [2,2,0,8,0,0]\n\nBut according to the training examples, the output often has the same pattern extended. For example, in Example 0's output, the third row (row 2) is filled with 2s and a 4. Similarly, in Example 1, the fourth row (row 3) is filled with 2s and a 4.\n\nSo for the test input's row 4, which has 2s, the output row 4 would be filled with 2s except column 3 (which is 4). And column 3 would have 8s in all rows except rows 0 and 1, and row 4's column 3 is 4.\n\nAdditionally, columns 0 and 1 would have 2s in all rows except row 4 (since the input's 2s are in row 4).\n\nSo the test output would be:\n\n[0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0]\n\n[0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0]\n\n[2, 2, 0, 8, 0, 0]\n\n[2, 2, 0, 8, 0, 0]\n\n[2, 2, 2, 4, 2, 2]\n\n[2, 2, 0, 8, 0, 0]\n\nBut wait, looking at Example 0's output, the 2s in row 2 are filled across the entire row except column 4. Similarly, in the test input's row 4, the 2s would fill the entire row except column 3. So row 4's output would be [2,2,2,4,2,2].\n\nThe columns 0 and 1, filled with 2s except in row 4 where they are 2s. Wait, no. According to Example 0's training example, the columns with input values (like column 4) are filled with 8s in all rows except the original rows. But in the test input's case, the columns 0 and 1 have 2s in row 4. So according to the pattern, those columns (0 and 1) would be filled with 2s in all rows except row 4. So rows 0,1,2,3,5 would have 2s in columns 0 and 1. But in the input's rows 0 and 1, columns 0 and 1 are 0, but the output's rows 0 and 1 would have 2s there. But in the training examples, the output's rows 0 and 1 retained their original values. So this suggests that the columns are filled except for the original rows. So for the test input's columns 0 and 1 (from row 4's 2s), the columns would be filled with 2s in all rows except row 4.\n\nSo rows 0,1,2,3,5 of columns 0 and 1 would be 2s. Row 4's columns 0 and 1 are 2s (original input), so no change.\n\nSo the test output would be:\n\nRow 0: [2, 2, 0, 8, 0, 0]\n\nBut wait, but in the training examples, the original rows with 8s remained the same. So perhaps the filled columns only affect other rows, not the original rows.\n\nFor example, in Example 0's input, the 8s in rows 0 and 1, column 4. The output's column 4 is filled with 8s in rows 2,3,4,5, but rows 0 and 1 remain as input.\n\nSo for the test input's columns 0 and 1 (from row 4's 2s), the columns would be filled with 2s in rows 0,1,2,3,5. Row 4's columns 0 and 1 are already 2s.\n\nSimilarly, column 3 is filled with 8s in rows 2,3,4,5.\n\nPutting this together:\n\nRow 0: [0,0,0,8,0,0] \u2192 but columns 0 and 1 would be filled with 2s from column 0 and 1's 2s. So row 0 would be [2,2,0,8,0,0]\n\nRow 1: [2,2,0,8,0,0]\n\nRow 2: [2,2,0,8,0,0]\n\nRow 3: [2,2,0,8,0,0]\n\nRow 4: [2,2,2,4,2,2]\n\nRow 5: [2,2,0,8,0,0]\n\nBut according to the training examples, the original rows (with 8s) in the input remain the same in the output. For example, Example 0's first two rows are unchanged. So this suggests that in the test input's rows 0 and 1 (which have 8s), their columns 0 and 1 would not be overwritten by the 2s from the column fill. So rows 0 and 1's columns 0 and 1 remain 0, while other rows get 2s.\n\nSo the test output would be:\n\nRow 0: [0,0,0,8,0,0] (original remains)\n\nRow 1: [0,0,0,8,0,0] (original remains)\n\nRow 2: [2,2,0,8,0,0] (columns 0 and 1 filled with 2s from row 4's input, column 3 filled with 8 from columns 3's input)\n\nRow 3: [2,2,0,8,0,0] (same as row 2)\n\nRow 4: [2,2,2,4,2,2] (row filled with 2s except column 3, which is 4)\n\nRow 5: [2,2,0,8,0,0] (columns 0 and 1 filled with 2s, column 3 filled with 8)\n\nBut this doesn't match the training examples exactly. In Example 0's output, the rows 3-5 have 8s in column 4, but other columns are 0. In the test input's case, rows 2,3,5 would have 2s in columns 0 and 1 and 8s in column 3. This seems plausible.\n\nBut comparing with Example 0's output, after the row with the 2s (row 2), the following rows have 8s in column 4. So perhaps in the test input's case, after row 4 (which has the 2s), the following rows would have 8s in column 3.\n\nWait, the test input's row 4 is the one with the 2s, so in the output, row 4 would have 2s in all columns except column 3 (4), and the column 3 is filled with 8s in all rows except rows 0,1, and 4.\n\nSo rows 2,3,5 would have 8s in column 3.\n\nThus, the test output would be:\n\nRow 0: [0,0,0,8,0,0]\n\nRow 1: [0,0,0,8,0,0]\n\nRow 2: [0,0,0,8,0,0]\n\nRow 3: [0,0,0,8,0,0]\n\nRow 4: [2,2,2,4,2,2]\n\nRow 5: [0,0,0,8,0,0]\n\nBut that can't be right, because the columns 0 and 1 are filled with 2s from row 4's input.\n\nHmm. I think I'm overcomplicating this. Based on the training examples, the output seems to have the following structure:\n\n- For each non-zero cell in the input, the entire row is filled with its value, except for the column(s) where other non-zero cells are present in the input.\n\n- Similarly, the entire column is filled with the value, except for the row(s) where other non-zero cells are present.\n\n- The intersection cell (where the row and column meet) has the value doubled or some combination.\n\nBut I'm not sure. Given the time I've spent, I'll proceed with the test input's output based on the pattern observed in the training examples.\n\nApplying the pattern from the training examples to the test input:\n\nThe test input has 8s in rows 0 and 1, column 3. And 2s in row 4, columns 0 and 1.\n\nFollowing Example 0 and 1:\n\nThe output will have:\n\n- The original 8s in rows 0 and 1, column 3.\n\n- The entire column 3 filled with 8s in all other rows (rows 2,3,4,5).\n\n- The original 2s in row 4, columns 0 and 1.\n\n- The entire row 4 filled with 2s except column 3 (which is 4).\n\n- The columns 0 and 1 filled with 2s in all rows except row 4.\n\nSo the output rows would be:\n\nRow 0: [0,0,0,8,0,0] (original remains)\n\nRow 1: [0,0,0,8,0,0] (original remains)\n\nRow 2: [2,2,0,8,0,0] (columns 0 and 1 filled from row 4's 2s, column 3 filled from 8s)\n\nRow 3: [2,2,0,8,0,0] (same as row 2)\n\nRow 4: [2,2,2,4,2,2] (row filled with 2s except column 3, which is 4)\n\nRow 5: [2,2,0,8,0,0] (columns 0 and 1 filled, column 3 filled)\n\nBut in Example 0's output, the rows affected by the 8s have 8s in their column. Similarly, the test input's rows affected by the 8s would have 8s in column 3. Rows affected by the 2s would have 2s in columns 0 and 1. The intersection of row 4 and column 3 would be 4 (2*2).\n\nSo the final answer would be:\n\n[0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0]\n\n[0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0]\n\n[2, 2, 0, 8, 0, 0]\n\n[2, 2, 0, 8, 0, 0]\n\n[2, 2, 2, 4, 2, 2]\n\n[2, 2, 0, 8, 0, 0]\n\nBut comparing to the training examples, perhaps row 4's columns should all be 2 except column 3. And columns 0 and 1 are filled with 2s except row 4. So rows 0,1,2,3,5 have 2s in columns 0 and 1.\n\nThus, the final output would be as above."
