        "cot_1": "Okay, let's see. I need to figure out the pattern from the training examples and apply it to the test input. Let's start by looking at the examples one by one.\n\nLooking at Example 0. The input is a 5x7 grid. The output is three rows. The first output row is [2,2,0], the second [2,2,3], and the third [0,0,2]. Hmm. Let's see the input. The input has numbers like 1s, 2s, and a 3. Maybe the output is related to clusters of numbers greater than 1? Like, maybe the output rows represent the values of those clusters and their positions?\n\nIn the first input row of Example 0, all are 1s except in the second row, there's a 2,2. Then in the third row, 2,2,3. Maybe the clusters are the contiguous non-1 numbers. So for each cluster, we take the value and maybe its count or position. Wait, the output rows have three elements each. Let me check the input dimensions. The input is 5 rows. The output is 3 rows. Maybe each output row corresponds to a cluster in a certain position?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is capturing the top, middle, and bottom parts of the clusters. Like, for each vertical column in the input grid, tracking the numbers that are not 1 and their positions. But Example 0's output has three rows, which might correspond to the three clusters: the two 2s in the second row, the 2s and 3 in the third, and the single 2 in the fourth row. But how does that map to the output?\n\nWait, let's think about the clusters. In Example 0's input:\n\nRow 1: all 1s.\n\nRow 2: [1,2,2,1,1,1,1]. So positions 2 and 3 are 2s.\n\nRow 3: [1,2,2,3,1,1,1]. Positions 2,3 are 2s and position 4 is 3.\n\nRow 4: [1,1,1,2,1,1,1]. Position 4 is 2.\n\nSo the clusters here are the 2s in row 2 and 3 (forming a block), the 3 in row 3, and the 2 in row 4. But the output is three rows. Let's look at the output:\n\nFirst output row: [2,2,0] \u2013 maybe the first two elements are the cluster value (2,2) and the third is 0. Wait, maybe each output row represents a horizontal layer of the cluster. Like, for each cluster, how it appears in each horizontal layer. For example, the first cluster (the two 2s in rows 2 and 3) might have two layers. The top part (row 2) is two 2s, then the middle part (row 3) is two 2s again, but then the 3 is in the same row but next column. Hmm, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is capturing the number of adjacent non-1 elements in each vertical position. Let's check the first example's output. For the first output row [2,2,0], maybe in the top part of the cluster, there are two 2s. Then in the middle part, two 2s and a 3. But how does that translate to the output rows?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is grouping consecutive non-1 elements vertically. For example, in Example 0, the cluster starting at row 2, column 2 and 3. Then in row 3, columns 2,3 again, and column 4. Then row 4, column 4. So maybe each output row corresponds to the vertical layers of a cluster. So the first cluster (the 2s in rows 2-3 columns 2-3) has two layers (rows 2 and 3), each with two 2s. The second cluster is the 3 in row 3, column 4, but that's a single element. Then the third cluster is the 2 in row 4, column 4. But the output has three rows. The first output row is [2,2,0], maybe each element represents the value and the count in each vertical layer. For example, first layer (top) of cluster 1 has 2 (value) and 2 (count), then 0 for the third element if there's no third cluster. Then the second row might be cluster 1's next layer (another 2,2?), cluster 2's 3, and cluster 3's 2. But the output's second row is [2,2,3], which would fit if the first cluster's second layer is 2,2, the second cluster's first layer is 3 (count 1?), but maybe the third element is 3. Then the third output row [0,0,2] could be the cluster 3's layer (the 2 in row 4). But this is getting a bit complicated. Maybe another approach.\n\nLooking at Example 1's input. The input is a 7x7 grid. The output has two rows: [3,0,2] and [3,0,2]. The input has clusters of 3s and 2s. Let's see: in row 2, columns 3 is 3, and column 5 is 2. Row 3 is same. So clusters: two 3s vertically in columns 3, and two 2s vertically in column 5. The output is two rows. Maybe each output row corresponds to the clusters in each vertical layer. The first output row is [3,0,2] \u2013 perhaps 3 (the value) with count 2, then 0, then 2 (value 2, count 2). But how does that fit? Alternatively, each output row represents a horizontal slice of the clusters. Since there are two clusters (the two 3s and the two 2s), each in two rows. So the output rows might be for each of those layers. So first output row [3,0,2] could be the 3s and 2s in the first layer (row 2), then the second layer (row 3) again [3,0,2]. But why 0? Maybe the clusters are arranged in columns, and each output row is for each consecutive group. For example, the 3s are in column 3, spanning rows 2 and 3. The 2s are in column 5, same rows. So each cluster spans two layers. The output has two rows, perhaps each row represents a layer. The first layer (row 2) has a 3 in column 3 and a 2 in column 5. The second layer (row 3) same. But how does that become [3,0,2]? Maybe grouping adjacent columns. Like, in the first output row, the 3 is in position 1, then 0 (no cluster in position 2), then 2 in position 3. But how does that fit the example?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is capturing the maximum value in each vertical column of the input, but excluding 1s, but that doesn't fit. For Example 0, the first output row is [2,2,0], perhaps the first three columns. Looking at input columns in Example 0:\n\nColumns (assuming each list is a row):\n\nColumn 0: all 1s except row 1 (1), etc. But not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the output rows represent clusters of numbers greater than 1, and each output row lists the values of the clusters in each vertical level. For example, if a cluster spans multiple rows, each level's value is part of the output. But the output rows are arranged such that each cluster's vertical layers are captured. But this is getting too vague.\n\nLet me look at Example 2. Input is 7x6. Output is three rows: [5,5], [5,5], [6,6]. The input has 5s in rows 2 and 3, columns 2 and 3. Then 6s in row 4, columns 2 and 3. So the clusters are two layers of 5s (rows 2-3) and one layer of 6s (row4). The output has three rows: first two [5,5] and then [6,6]. So each cluster's vertical layers are represented as output rows. The 5s are in two consecutive rows, so two output rows of [5,5], and the 6s in one row, so one output row of [6,6]. That makes sense. So the output is capturing each horizontal layer of the clusters. So for each cluster (a group of same numbers adjacent vertically and/or horizontally?), each horizontal row in the cluster contributes an output row with the values of that row's part of the cluster.\n\nWait, in Example 2, the 5s are in rows 2 and 3, columns 2-3. So each of those rows has two 5s. So the output has two rows of [5,5], then the 6s in row4, which is a single row with two 6s, so one row [6,6]. So the output lists each horizontal layer of each cluster. Clusters are groups of same numbers connected (maybe orthogonally adjacent), but perhaps in vertical stacks. So each time a number is in a vertical stack, each horizontal slice becomes an output row. But then in Example 1, the clusters are columns of 3s and 2s. So each 3 in row 2 and 3 (column3) would produce two output rows of [3], but perhaps they're merged if adjacent. Wait, but in Example1's output, the output is two rows of [3,0,2]. Hmm. Let's think again.\n\nIn Example1's input, there are two vertical clusters: in column3, two 3s (rows2 and3), and in column5, two 2s (rows2 and3). So each cluster spans two rows. So for each cluster, each row contributes to the output. But the output has two rows. Each output row has three elements: 3,0,2. Maybe the output rows are combining the elements from different clusters in the same layer. Like, in the first layer (row2), the 3 is in column3 and the 2 in column5. The output row for this layer is [3,0,2], where 0 indicates no cluster in the middle. Then the same for row3. But how are the elements grouped into the array? Maybe clusters in the same horizontal row are grouped into the output array, sorted by their positions. So in row2, the 3 is in column3 and the 2 in column5. The output for that layer would list the clusters left to right. So 3 comes first (column3), then 2 (column5). But why three elements? The output is [3,0,2]. Maybe if there are gaps between clusters, they are filled with 0. For example, if in row2, the 3 is in column3 and the 2 in column5, then between them (columns4) there's a 1, which is ignored. So the output for that row's clusters would be 3, then 0 (since no cluster between 3 and 2), then 2. But that would fit the [3,0,2] in each of the two output rows. Then, in the output, each such horizontal layer's cluster sequence is captured. So the output is the list of clusters in each horizontal layer of the input, ordered from left to right, with 0s separating non-consecutive clusters. But how do we determine clusters in a horizontal row?\n\nAlternatively, in each horizontal row of the input, the clusters are consecutive non-1 numbers. For each such cluster, we take their value. Then, the output is a list of these clusters per row, but only for rows that have non-1 numbers. Wait, but in Example0, the input's rows 2,3,4 have non-1 numbers. Let's see:\n\nExample0's input:\n\nRow2 (index1, assuming 0-based or 1-based? Probably 0-based) has [1,2,2,1,1,1,1]. So the cluster here is [2,2]. So output for this row would be [2,2].\n\nRow3: [1,2,2,3,1,1,1]. Clusters: [2,2,3]. But they are adjacent? 2,2 is a cluster, then 3 is a separate cluster. So this row has two clusters: [2,2] and [3]. So output would be [2,2,3].\n\nRow4: [1,1,1,2,1,1,1]. Cluster is [2]. So output [2].\n\nBut the actual output for Example0 is:\n\n[2,2,0]\n\n[2,2,3]\n\n[0,0,2]\n\nHmm. So the output seems to have three rows. Perhaps the output is grouping these clusters vertically. Like, each cluster that spans multiple rows contributes to the output. For example, the 2s in rows2 and3 (columns2-3) form a vertical cluster of 2x2, so they would contribute [2,2] for each layer. Then the 3 in row3, column4 is a single-element cluster. The 2 in row4 is another single cluster. So the output rows are:\n\nFirst, the vertical cluster's layers: two layers (row2 and row3), each contributing [2,2,0] (since in row2, the 3 isn't present, so third element is 0). Then row3 has [2,2,3]. Then row4's 2 is [0,0,2]. But how are they arranged into the output rows? The output has three rows. Maybe the vertical clusters are each represented as a column in the output. For example, the first vertical cluster (the 2x2 block) spans two rows, so in the output, each of those layers is part of the same column. Then the 3 is a separate column, and the 2 in row4 is another column. But the output's first row is [2,2,0], second [2,2,3], third [0,0,2]. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the output is grouping clusters that are connected vertically. For each vertical position in the grid, if there's a cluster that spans multiple rows, then each row in that cluster contributes to an output row. But perhaps this is getting too complicated.\n\nAlternatively, the pattern is that the output lists the clusters in each row of the input where the cluster is not 1. Each cluster in the row is represented by its value, and consecutive clusters are separated by 0s. Wait, but in Example0's row3, there's a 2,2,3. So that's two clusters (2,2) and (3), so the output row would be [2,2,3]. But in the example's output, the second row is [2,2,3]. So maybe each row's clusters are concatenated, and if there are multiple clusters in a row, their values are listed in order. But then, how to handle vertical clusters?\n\nWait, maybe the output is the list of all horizontal clusters (consecutive non-1 numbers in a row) across all rows, grouped by their vertical position. For example, in Example0, the clusters are:\n\nRow2: [2,2]\n\nRow3: [2,2], [3]\n\nRow4: [2]\n\nThen the output is these clusters arranged vertically. But the output has three rows, each with three elements. Maybe each output row corresponds to a vertical level. For instance, the first output row captures the top-level clusters (row2's [2,2], row3's [2,2], and row4's [2] is not in the same vertical position). But not sure.\n\nAnother angle: looking at the output structure. Example0's output has three rows. The input has three rows with clusters (rows2,3,4). Each output row has three elements. Maybe each output row corresponds to a row in the input, but only the non-1 clusters. For example:\n\nRow2's clusters: [2,2] \u2192 output row [2,2, 0] (padding with 0 to reach three elements).\n\nRow3's clusters: [2,2,3] \u2192 output row [2,2,3].\n\nRow4's cluster: [2] \u2192 output row [0,0,2].\n\nBut why the padding? The output rows all have three elements. Maybe the maximum number of clusters in any row is three, so each row is padded with 0s. But in Example0, the row3 has two clusters (size 2 and 1), but the output has three elements. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, the output is grouping all the clusters from all the rows into a list, and each cluster is represented by its elements. But the output is arranged in rows of three elements each, filling with 0s if needed. For example, in Example0, the clusters are [2,2], [2,2], [3], [2]. That's four clusters. Split into three rows: [2,2,0], [2,2,3], [0,0,2]. But this doesn't align exactly. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, the output is for each connected cluster (regardless of shape) in the input, and each cluster is represented by the number of rows it spans. Then, for each such cluster, the output lists the value for each row in the cluster. For example, a cluster spanning two rows would contribute two entries to the output. Let's see:\n\nIn Example0:\n\n- The 2x2 block in rows2-3 (columns2-3) spans two rows. So this would contribute two output rows: [2,2,0] and [2,2,3]. But then where does the third output row come from?\n\n- The 3 in row3 is a single-row cluster, contributing [2,2,3] (but already covered? Not sure).\n\n- The 2 in row4 is a single-row cluster, contributing [0,0,2].\n\nThis might explain the three output rows. But the logic is not clear.\n\nAlternatively, the output lists for each vertical position in the grid the values of the cells that are not 1, vertically. For example, columns that have consecutive non-1 values form vertical clusters. Each such vertical cluster's values are listed in the output as a row. For instance, in Example0, column2 has 2,2,1. So the vertical cluster is 2,2. Column3 has 2,2,1. Column4 has 3,2. So vertical clusters are in columns2,3,4. So the output rows would be [2,2], [2,2], [3,2]. But the output in Example0 is three rows of three elements. Doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, consider that each output row corresponds to a horizontal \"band\" in the input, capturing the non-1 numbers. For example, the first output row of Example0 is [2,2,0], which could correspond to the top part of the clusters (row2: 2,2, and then the 3 hasn't appeared yet). The second row [2,2,3] is the middle part (row3: 2,2 and the 3), and the third row [0,0,2] is the bottom part (row4: the 2). So each output row represents a layer of the cluster structure vertically. So for each vertical position in the clusters, the output lists the values of each layer. If a layer doesn't have a value in that position, it's 0.\n\nIn Example0's test input, the clusters are:\n\n- In row2, column2-3: 2,2.\n\n- In row3, column2-3: 2,2 and column4:3.\n\n- In row4, column4:2.\n\nSo the vertical structure has three layers (rows2,3,4). The first layer (row2) has 2,2 in columns2-3. The second layer (row3) has 2,2 in columns2-3 and 3 in column4. The third layer (row4) has 2 in column4. \n\nThe output is three rows, each corresponding to these layers. Each output row has three elements, possibly representing the leftmost, middle, and rightmost parts of the clusters. For example, in the first layer (row2), the left cluster is 2,2 (columns2-3), so maybe represented as [2,2,0]. In the second layer (row3), the left cluster is 2,2 and the right is 3, so [2,2,3]. In the third layer (row4), only the right part has a 2, so [0,0,2]. This seems to fit.\n\nSimilarly, Example1's input has two vertical clusters in columns3 and5. Each spans two rows (rows2 and3). So for each of the two layers (rows2 and3), the clusters are 3 in column3 and 2 in column5. The output rows are [3,0,2], indicating that in each layer, there's a 3 on the left, nothing in the middle, and a 2 on the right. So two output rows for the two layers.\n\nExample2's input has two vertical clusters: 5s in rows2-3 (columns2-3) and 6s in row4 (columns2-3). Each 5 cluster spans two layers, so two output rows of [5,5], and the 6 cluster spans one layer, so one output row [6,6]. \n\nSo the pattern seems to be:\n\n- Identify vertical clusters (groups of non-1 numbers that are vertically aligned and consecutive in columns).\n\n- For each vertical cluster, create output rows corresponding to each layer (row) in the cluster.\n\n- Each output row lists the values of the clusters in that layer from left to right, with 0s separating non-consecutive clusters.\n\nWait, but in Example0, the first layer's output is [2,2,0], but in row2, there's only one cluster (2,2 in columns2-3). So why three elements? Maybe the output rows are designed to have three elements regardless, with the third element being 0 if there's no third cluster in that layer.\n\nAlternatively, the output captures the leftmost, middle, and rightmost clusters in each layer. For example, in Example0's row3, there are two clusters: [2,2] and [3], so they are considered left and middle, but the third element is 0. Or perhaps it's ordered left to right, with each consecutive cluster in the row being in the output elements. So for row3, the first cluster is [2,2], then [3], so the output row is [2,2,3]. If there are more than three clusters in a row, perhaps they are truncated or not considered, but the examples don't show that.\n\nAnother observation: the number of output rows equals the maximum number of vertical layers any cluster has. For example:\n\n- Example0: the 2s in columns2-3 span two rows (layers), the 3 and the 2 in column4 are single layers. So maximum layers is 3 (the row4 is a separate layer). Wait, but row4 is a separate cluster. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, the output rows correspond to each row in the input that contains non-1 numbers. For each such row, the clusters in that row are listed left to right, and each output row has three elements, padding with 0s if needed.\n\nExample0's input has non-1 numbers in rows2,3,4. So three output rows. Each row's clusters are:\n\nRow2: [2,2] \u2192 output [2,2,0]\n\nRow3: [2,2], [3] \u2192 output [2,2,3]\n\nRow4: [2] \u2192 output [0,0,2]\n\nThis matches the output. Similarly, Example1's input has non-1 numbers in rows2 and3. Each of these rows has two clusters (3 and 2). So two output rows, each [3,0,2]. Example2's input has non-1 numbers in rows2,3,4. Each row:\n\nRow2: [5,5] \u2192 output [5,5,0]\n\nRow3: [5,5] \u2192 [5,5,0]\n\nRow4: [6,6] \u2192 [6,6,0]\n\nBut the actual output is [5,5], [5,5], [6,6]. Oh, wait, the output rows have two elements each. So maybe the number of elements per output row depends on the number of clusters in that input row. For example, in Example2's input rows 2,3 have one cluster each (two 5s), and row4 has one cluster (two 6s). So the output rows would be [5,5], [5,5], [6,6]. But in the given output for Example2, the first two output rows are [5,5], then [5,5], and then [6,6]. So each input row with non-1 numbers contributes an output row with the clusters in that input row. If a row has multiple clusters (like Example0's row3), the output row concatenates their values. But how?\n\nWait, in Example0's row3, there are two clusters: [2,2] and [3]. So the output row for that input row is [2,2,3]. But the output rows are allowed to have more elements if there are multiple clusters. But in Example2, each input row has one cluster, so the output rows have two elements (the two 5s or 6s). So perhaps the output for each input row is the list of clusters in that row, with each cluster's elements represented as their value. But in Example0's row3, the two clusters are [2,2] and [3], so the output row would be [2,2,3]. But how are the clusters' elements represented? Because the [2,2] is a cluster of two elements, so maybe their values are listed, and the [3] is another cluster. So the output row lists the elements of each cluster in order, concatenated. So row3's output is [2,2,3]. Similarly, row2's output is [2,2], which would be two elements, but in the Example0's output, it's padded to three elements with a 0. Wait, but Example0's output has three elements per row. Hmm, this seems conflicting.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each cluster is represented by its value and its size. For example, a cluster of two 2s would be represented as 2,2, and a single 3 as 3. So row3's output would be [2,2,3], which fits. But in Example2, each cluster is two of the same numbers, so the output is [5,5], [5,5], [6,6]. This matches. Similarly, in Example1's row2 and3, each row has two clusters: a single 3 and a single 2, but the output is [3,0,2]. Wait, but then the cluster sizes would be 1 each, but in the output, it's written as 3,0,2. So maybe the 0 is a separator. Alternatively, the output is the list of cluster values in order, separated by 0s if they are not adjacent. For example, in row2 of Example1, the clusters are at columns3 (3) and column5 (2). So in the row, there are two non-adjacent clusters, separated by a 1. So the output row would be [3,0,2], indicating 3 followed by 2 with a 0 in between. So the output for each input row is a list of the values of the clusters in that row, ordered left to right, separated by 0s if there are gaps between them. So consecutive clusters are listed with their values, and non-consecutive ones are separated by 0s. But the exact way of handling gaps is unclear.\n\nSo, to apply this to the test input:\n\nTest Input:\n\n[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]\n\n[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]\n\n[1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1]\n\n[1, 1, 2, 3, 1, 1]\n\n[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]\n\n[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]\n\nThe rows with non-1 numbers are rows 2 and 3 (0-based, assuming the first line is row0). Let's check:\n\nRow2: [1,1,1,2,1,1] \u2192 cluster is [2]\n\nRow3: [1,1,2,3,1,1] \u2192 clusters are [2] and [3], which are adjacent? Wait, no: 2 is at index2, 3 at index3. They are adjacent, so maybe they form a single cluster [2,3]. Wait, but are they considered the same cluster if they are adjacent? Or do they need to have the same value?\n\nAh, this is crucial. Clusters are groups of adjacent (horizontal or vertical) cells with the same value. So in row3, if there's a 2 followed by a 3, they are different values, so separate clusters. So row3 has two clusters: [2] and [3].\n\nSo for row2: cluster is [2] \u2192 output [2].\n\nRow3: clusters are [2], [3] \u2192 output [2,3].\n\nBut according to the training examples, when there are multiple clusters in a row separated by non-1 numbers, how are they represented? Let's look at Example0's row3: [1,2,2,3,1,1,1]. Clusters are [2,2] and [3], so output is [2,2,3]. Example1's row2: [1,1,3,1,2,1,1]. Clusters are [3] and [2], separated by a 1. So output is [3,0,2]. So when clusters are separated by 1s, they are separated by 0s in the output. If clusters are adjacent, their values are listed consecutively.\n\nSo in the test input's row3: [1,1,2,3,1,1]. The clusters are [2] and [3], which are adjacent (no 1s between them). Wait, the 2 and 3 are adjacent, but different values. So would they be considered separate clusters even though they are adjacent but different values? Yes. So the clusters are [2] and [3]. Since they are adjacent (but different values), they are separate. So the output row would be [2,3].\n\nBut in Example0's row3, [2,2,3], the 2s are same value, so they form a cluster, then the 3 is separate. So the output is [2,2,3]. In Example1's row2, the 3 and 2 are separated by a 1, so output [3,0,2]. So the rule seems to be: in a row, list the clusters of same non-1 values, left to right. If two clusters are separated by 1s, insert a 0 between them. If they are adjacent but different values, no 0 needed. Wait, no. Because in Example1's row2, the 3 and 2 are separated by a 1, hence the 0 in output. But if two different clusters are adjacent (like 2 and 3 in test input's row3), are they separated by 0 or not? Let's see.\n\nExample0's row3: [1,2,2,3,1,1,1]. The clusters are [2,2] and [3], which are adjacent (no 1s between them). So the output is [2,2,3]. No 0 between them. So in this case, adjacent different clusters are listed consecutively. So in the test input's row3, clusters are [2] and [3], adjacent. So the output row would be [2,3].\n\nBut how does that fit into the output structure? Looking at the training examples, when there are multiple clusters in a row, they are separated by 0s only if there are 1s between them. Adjacent different clusters are listed consecutively. So for the test input:\n\nRow2: cluster is [2] \u2192 output [2]\n\nRow3: clusters are [2], [3] \u2192 output [2,3]\n\nBut according to the training examples' output formats, the output is a list of lists. For Example0, each output row has three elements. Example1's output rows have three elements. Example2's output rows have two elements. So the number of elements per output row varies based on the clusters in that input row. For instance, if a row has two clusters, each of size 1, then the output row would have two elements. But in Example1, the output rows have three elements. Wait, Example1's input rows have two clusters separated by a 1, so output is [3,0,2]. So the total elements per output row are the sum of the cluster elements plus 0s for gaps. For example, in Example1's row2: the clusters are [3], [2], separated by a 1. So the output row is [3,0,2]. So the 0 is inserted to indicate the gap. So whenever there are non-1 clusters separated by one or more 1s, they are separated by 0s in the output. Adjacent clusters (different values) are listed without 0s.\n\nSo in the test input's row3, the clusters are [2] and [3], which are adjacent (no 1s between them). So the output row would be [2,3]. But according to the training examples, how are the output rows structured? For example, Example0's row3 has two clusters (2,2 and 3) with no 1s between them, so output is [2,2,3]. Example1's row2 has two clusters separated by a 1, so output [3,0,2].\n\nSo the rule is: for each input row with clusters, the output row is formed by concatenating the elements of each cluster (each cluster's elements are listed with their value), and inserting a 0 for each gap of 1s between clusters. So in the test input's row3, since the 2 and 3 are adjacent (different values), but no 1s between them, they are considered adjacent clusters. But how to represent that. Are they separated by a 0 or not?\n\nWait, in Example0's row3, the clusters are [2,2] and [3], adjacent. So the output row is [2,2,3]. So no 0 between them. So different clusters that are adjacent (no 1s between) are concatenated without 0s. So for the test input's row3: [2] and [3], adjacent clusters, output row is [2,3].\n\nBut the output needs to be structured as lists. So for the test input's row2: [2], row3: [2,3]. So the output should be two rows:\n\n[2]\n\n[2,3]\n\nBut in the training examples, the outputs are structured with each row having at least two elements. Let me check Example2:\n\nExample2's input rows with clusters:\n\nRow2: [5,5] \u2192 output [5,5]\n\nRow3: [5,5] \u2192 [5,5]\n\nRow4: [6,6] \u2192 [6,6]\n\nSo each cluster is two elements, output as two elements per row.\n\nTest input's row2 has a single 2 \u2192 output [2]. But according to Example0's row4, which has a single 2 \u2192 output [0,0,2]. Wait, this is conflicting. Why in Example0, the single 2 becomes [0,0,2], but in Example2, the single 6s are [6,6]?\n\nAh, perhaps I misunderstood the clusters. Clusters are groups of horizontally adjacent non-1 numbers. So in Example0's row4, the 2 is alone, so the cluster is [2], but the output row is [0,0,2]. Maybe the output rows always have three elements, padding with 0s. But Example2's output rows have two elements. So this theory is invalid.\n\nWait, in Example2's output, the rows are [5,5], [5,5], [6,6]. So the clusters are two elements each. So the output row is the cluster's elements. So a cluster of two 5s in a row is output as [5,5], and a cluster of two 6s as [6,6]. So in that case, the number of elements in the output row equals the size of the cluster in that input row.\n\nBut in Example0's row2, the cluster is two 2s \u2192 output [2,2,0]. Which is three elements. So this doesn't fit. So maybe there's another factor.\n\nAlternatively, the output row is the list of all cluster values in that input row. For example, in Example0's row3, the clusters are [2,2] and [3], which have values 2 and 3. So the output row is [2,2,3], which lists the values of each cluster's elements. But why [2,2,3] instead of [2,3]? Because the first cluster has two elements (2,2), so both are listed. The second cluster has one element (3). So the output for that row is [2,2,3]. So the output row is the concatenation of all the elements of the clusters in the input row, in order. So clusters are considered as groups of same-value, horizontally adjacent cells. The output row lists each element's value in the cluster, left to right. For example:\n\n- In Example0's row2, cluster is two 2s \u2192 output [2,2].\n\n- But the actual output is [2,2,0], implying three elements. So this theory is incorrect.\n\nHmm. This is getting quite challenging. Let's try to re-examine all examples with the following hypothesis:\n\nThe output is the list of all horizontal clusters in the input, ordered by the row they appear in and their left-to-right position. Each cluster is represented by its values in the order they appear in the cluster. Each output row corresponds to a single cluster. If a cluster spans multiple rows (vertically), each row of the cluster is a separate output row.\n\nWait, in Example0's input, the vertical cluster of 2s spans two rows. So each row's part of the cluster is output as a row. Then the 3 is a single row, and the 2 in row4 is another single row. So the output would have 2+1+1=4 rows. But the actual output has three rows, so this is not matching.\n\nAlternatively, each vertical cluster contributes as many output rows as its height. So the 2x2 cluster (2 rows) contributes two output rows. The 3 and 2 each contribute one row. Total 4, but the example's output has three rows. So this doesn't fit.\n\nMaybe the output rows are formed by looking at each connected cluster (regardless of direction) and listing their elements row-wise. For example, a 2x2 cluster would have two rows in the output. But again, not matching the examples.\n\nAnother angle: the output lists the layers of the \"highest\" clusters. For example, the largest cluster in terms of height. But this is not clear.\n\nLet me try to find a pattern that fits all examples:\n\nExample0:\n\nInput rows with non-1s:\n\nRow2: [1,2,2,1,...] \u2192 cluster: 2,2.\n\nOutput row: [2,2,0]\n\nRow3: [1,2,2,3,...] \u2192 clusters: 2,2 and 3.\n\nOutput row: [2,2,3]\n\nRow4: [1,1,1,2,...] \u2192 cluster: 2.\n\nOutput row: [0,0,2]\n\nExample0's output is three rows, each with three elements. The first two elements in the first two rows are 2,2. The third element in row3 is 3. The third element in row4 is 2. 0s are used to fill the gaps. So maybe the output rows are the transpose of the clusters' columns. For example, each output column corresponds to a vertical cluster. Let's see:\n\nVertical cluster 1: columns2-3, rows2-3 (values 2,2 in row2; 2,2 in row3). So vertically, this would be:\n\nRow2: 2,2\n\nRow3: 2,2\n\nRow4: 1,1 (but no, because row4 has 2 in column4). Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, vertical clusters are columns with consecutive non-1 values. For example, column2 in Example0 has 2,2,1. Column3 has 2,2,1. Column4 has 3,2.\n\nSo vertical clusters are:\n\nColumn2: two 2s.\n\nColumn3: two 2s.\n\nColumn4: 3 and 2 (different values, so separate clusters).\n\nSo output rows would be:\n\nFor column2's cluster: [2,2]\n\nFor column3's cluster: [2,2]\n\nFor column4's clusters: [3], [2]\n\nBut the output for Example0 is three rows: [2,2,0], [2,2,3], [0,0,2]. This doesn't align.\n\nAlternatively, the output is generated by considering each vertical position where a cluster starts. For example, in Example0, the 2s start in row2, columns2-3. The 3 starts in row3, column4. The 2 in row4, column4. So the output rows are ordered by the row where the cluster starts and then left to right. Each cluster's layers are output row by row. So the first cluster (row2, columns2-3) contributes two rows (2,2 and 2,2). The second cluster (row3, column4) contributes one row (3). The third cluster (row4, column4) contributes one row (2). But how to combine them into three output rows. Maybe:\n\nFirst output row: 2,2 (from first cluster's first layer) and 0 for third cluster.\n\nSecond output row: 2,2 (first cluster's second layer) and 3 (second cluster's layer).\n\nThird output row: 0,0 (no first cluster) and 2 (third cluster's layer).\n\nThis matches Example0's output. \n\nSo the pattern seems to be:\n\n- For each vertical cluster (a column or adjacent columns with consecutive non-1 values in consecutive rows), track the layers.\n\n- Each vertical cluster's layers contribute to the output rows. If multiple vertical clusters exist in the same vertical \"band\", their layers are combined in the output rows.\n\n- The output rows are formed by taking the leftmost vertical cluster's current layer value(s), then the middle, then the rightmost, padding with 0s if they don't contribute in that layer.\n\nApplying this to the test input:\n\nTest input has non-1 numbers in rows2 and3:\n\nRow2: column4 has 2 (single element).\n\nRow3: column3 has 2 and column4 has 3 (adjacent but different values).\n\nVertical clusters:\n\n- Column4, row2: 2 (single layer).\n\n- Column3, row3: 2 (single layer).\n\n- Column4, row3: 3 (single layer).\n\nSo the vertical clusters are three separate single-layer clusters. \n\nAccording to the pattern from Example0, the output rows would be:\n\nFirst layer (row2's cluster): column4's 2 \u2192 output row would have this cluster in the rightmost position: [0,0,2].\n\nSecond layer (row3's clusters): column3's 2 and column4's 3 \u2192 these are adjacent but different. So the output row would be [2,3,0], but considering left to right. Wait, column3 is left of column4. So the left cluster is 2 in column3, then 3 in column4. So the output row would be [2,3,0]. But according to Example0's row3, where 2,2 is left and 3 is right, the output row is [2,2,3]. So in that case, left cluster is first, then right. So in the test input's row3, the left cluster is 2 (column3), then 3 (column4). So the output row would be [2,3,0] (assuming three elements), but how does this fit with Example0's format.\n\nAlternatively, each vertical cluster is considered a separate band. For the test input:\n\nVertical clusters:\n\n- Cluster1: column4, row2 \u2192 [2]\n\n- Cluster2: column3, row3 \u2192 [2]\n\n- Cluster3: column4, row3 \u2192 [3]\n\nEach of these clusters is a single layer. So the output rows would be:\n\nFor cluster1 (row2): [0,0,2]\n\nFor cluster2 (row3): [2,0,0]\n\nFor cluster3 (row3): [0,3,0]\n\nBut since they are in the same row (row3 for clusters2 and3), perhaps they are combined into a single output row. But this is unclear.\n\nAlternatively, the output rows are generated for each row in the input that has clusters. Each such input row's clusters are listed left to right in the output row, with their values. If multiple clusters are in the same input row, they are concatenated. For example:\n\nTest input's row2: cluster is [2] \u2192 output row [2].\n\nTest input's row3: clusters are [2] and [3] \u2192 output row [2,3].\n\nBut according to the training examples, Example1's output has three elements per row. In Example1's input rows2 and3 each have two clusters (3 and 2), separated by 1s, so output rows are [3,0,2]. Which is three elements. So the output rows are formed by listing clusters in the input row, left to right, inserting 0s between clusters if they are separated by 1s, and padding with 0s to make three elements.\n\nSo for the test input:\n\nRow2: cluster [2] \u2192 output [2,0,0] (but no, Example0's row4's cluster is [2], output is [0,0,2]. So perhaps the position depends on where the cluster is located. In row2 of the test input, the cluster is in column4 (assuming 0-based columns). The input row is [1,1,1,2,1,1]. So column3 (if 0-based) is 2. So the cluster is at column3 (if the first element is index0). Wait, let's index properly.\n\nTest input's row2 (third row, assuming input is 0-based rows):\n\nRow2 (third row in input list) is [1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1]. So indexes 0-5. The 2 is at index3.\n\nRow3: [1, 1, 2, 3, 1, 1]. The 2 is at index2, 3 at index3.\n\nSo in row2, the cluster is at index3. In row3, clusters are at index2 and 3.\n\nIn Example0's row4, the cluster is at index3, and the output row is [0,0,2]. So perhaps the output row's elements correspond to the columns of the input, grouped into left, middle, right. For example, columns 0-1 (left), 2-3 (middle), 4-5 (right) for a 6-column input. Then, the output row elements represent the clusters in those groups.\n\nTest input's row2 has a cluster at column3 (middle group). So the middle element is 2, others 0 \u2192 [0,2,0]. But Example0's row4's cluster is at column3 (assuming 7 columns), and output is [0,0,2]. So perhaps columns are divided into left, middle, right thirds. For a 6-column input, left is columns 0-1, middle 2-3, right 4-5. So in row2, the 2 is in column3 (middle third), so the middle element is 2. So output row would be [0,2,0]. But Example0's row4 has 7 columns. Let's see:\n\nExample0's input rows are 7 columns. The cluster is at column3 (index3). So left (0-2), middle (3), right (4-6). So output [0,0,2]. But this is speculative.\n\nAlternatively, the output elements correspond to the leftmost, center, and rightmost positions of the cluster. For example, if a cluster spans multiple columns, the left and right elements are the values, and the center is 0. But this is unclear.\n\nThis approach is getting too stuck. Let's try to look for a different pattern.\n\nAnother idea: The output lists the number of consecutive non-1 numbers in each row, grouped by their value. For example, in Example0's row2: two 2s \u2192 output [2,2]. But this doesn't explain the 0s.\n\nAlternatively, the output is the count of non-1 elements in each row, but that doesn't fit either.\n\nWait, looking at the outputs:\n\nExample0 output:\n\n[2,2,0]\n\n[2,2,3]\n\n[0,0,2]\n\nThe third element in the first row is 0, then 3, then 2. So perhaps each output row represents a different region of the input grid. Like top, middle, bottom. The numbers in those regions are summed or listed.\n\nAlternatively, the output is derived by looking at the columns and for each column group (left, middle, right), taking the maximum non-1 value. But in Example0's first output row [2,2,0], the left and middle groups have 2s, right 0. But how are the groups determined.\n\nAlternatively, the output rows correspond to the vertical layers of the clusters, and each element in the output row represents a horizontal segment of that layer. For example, the first layer (top) has two 2s in the left segment, so [2,2,0]. The second layer has 2,2 in the left and a 3 in the middle, so [2,2,3]. The third layer has a 2 in the right segment, so [0,0,2].\n\nThis seems to fit. Let's test this with Example0:\n\nLayer1 (top): the 2s in columns2-3 (left segment) \u2192 [2,2,0].\n\nLayer2 (middle): 2s in columns2-3 and 3 in column4 (middle segment) \u2192 [2,2,3].\n\nLayer3 (bottom): 2 in column4 (right segment) \u2192 [0,0,2].\n\nFor Example1:\n\nLayer1 and 2 (rows2 and3) have 3 in left segment and 2 in right segment \u2192 [3,0,2] each.\n\nFor Example2:\n\nLayers1 and2 (rows2 and3): 5s in left segment \u2192 [5,5].\n\nLayer3 (row4): 6s in left segment \u2192 [6,6].\n\nAssuming that the segments are divided into left (columns0-2), middle (columns3-4), right (columns5-6) for a 7-column input, and similarly divided for other widths. \n\nTest input has 6 columns. Dividing into left (0-1), middle (2-3), right (4-5).\n\nRow2 (layer1): cluster is at column3 (middle segment) \u2192 value 2. So middle segment:2. Output row [0,2,0].\n\nRow3 (layer2): clusters at column2 (middle segment) and column3 (middle segment). Wait, column2 and3 are both in the middle segment. The 2 is at column2, 3 at column3. So middle segment has both 2 and 3. But they are different values. How to represent? \n\nIf the segments are considered as left, middle, right, and within each segment, the non-1 numbers are listed. For example:\n\nIn the test input's row3, middle segment (columns2-3) has values 2 and3. So the middle segment's contribution is 2 and3. So the output row would be [0, 2,3, 0]. But the training examples have three elements per row. So perhaps each segment is represented as one element. For example, the segment's value is the list of non-1 numbers in that segment, separated by commas, but the training examples don't use commas. Alternatively, each segment's value is the sum or product of its non-1 numbers. But this is unclear.\n\nAlternatively, each segment's value is the first non-1 number encountered. So in row3's middle segment (columns2-3), the first is 2, then 3. So the segment's value is 2. But this doesn't fit the examples.\n\nThis approach isn't working. Let me try to make a final guess based on the training examples.\n\nIn the test input, the non-1 numbers are:\n\nRow2: 2 in column3.\n\nRow3: 2 in column2 and 3 in column3.\n\nSo according to Example0's pattern where each row's clusters are listed with their values and 0s for gaps between clusters, the output should have two rows:\n\nRow2's output: [2] (but padded to three elements? Example0's row4's single 2 becomes [0,0,2]. So maybe the position in the output depends on the column of the cluster. If the cluster is in column3 of a 6-column input, which is the middle (columns 2-3?), then perhaps it's considered middle. So in row2's output: [0,2,0]. In row3's output: clusters are in columns2 and3 (middle), so the values are 2 and3. Since they are adjacent, no 0s between. So output row [2,3,0]. But in the training examples, when two clusters are in the same segment, like Example0's row3, the middle segment has [2,2,3], which becomes [2,2,3]. So perhaps each segment's clusters are listed, and if there are multiple clusters in the same segment, they are separated by 0s.\n\nAlternatively, each output row is divided into three elements, corresponding to left, middle, and right segments of the input row. The value of each element is the count of non-1 numbers in that segment, but that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, the output elements are the sums of non-1 numbers in each segment. For Example0's row2:\n\nLeft segment (columns0-2): 1,1,1 \u2192 sum 0 (since all are 1).\n\nMiddle segment (columns3-4): 2,1 \u2192 sum 2.\n\nRight segment (columns5-6): 1,1 \u2192 sum 0.\n\nSo output row [0,2,0]. But Example0's output is [2,2,0], so this doesn't fit.\n\nThis is really tough. Given the time I've spent and the need to provide an answer, I'll proceed with the following hypothesis based on the training examples:\n\nThe output rows correspond to the input rows that have non-1 numbers. For each such row, the output lists the clusters of non-1 numbers in left-to-right order, with each cluster's values listed. If clusters are separated by 1s, they are separated by 0s in the output. Each output row has as many elements as the number of clusters plus 0s for gaps between them. However, the examples show varying element counts, so perhaps it's simply listing the clusters in order, concatenated, and the output is formatted into rows with elements based on the training examples.\n\nFor the test input:\n\nRow2: [2] \u2192 output [2]\n\nRow3: [2,3] \u2192 output [2,3]\n\nBut the training examples have output rows with 2 or 3 elements. For example, Example2's output has rows of two elements. The test input's row3's output has two elements. So perhaps the output would be:\n\n[2]\n\n[2,3]\n\nBut the training examples' outputs are formatted with each row enclosed in brackets. Looking at Example2, which has three output rows, each with two elements. Example0's output has three rows with three elements. Example1's output has two rows with three elements. So the number of elements per row varies. But how to determine that.\n\nAlternatively, the test input's output should have two rows:\n\n[0, 2, 0]\n\n[2, 3, 0]\n\nBut I'm not sure. \n\nGiven the time constraints, I'll go with the following approach based on the training examples:\n\nFor each input row with non-1 numbers, list the clusters left to right. Each cluster's elements are written as their values. Clusters separated by 1s are separated by 0s. The output rows are these clusters lists.\n\nFor the test input:\n\nRow2: [2] \u2192 output [2]\n\nRow3: [2,3] \u2192 output [2,3]\n\nBut looking at Example1's output, when there are two clusters separated by 1s, the output row is [3,0,2]. So perhaps the test input's row3 has two adjacent clusters (no 1s in between), so output [2,3]. But according to the training examples, how many elements per row? Example0's row3 has three elements. Maybe the test input's output is:\n\n[0,2,0]\n\n[2,3,0]\n\nBut I'm not confident. Given the examples, perhaps the answer is two output rows:\n\nFirst row [0, 2, 0]\n\nSecond row [2, 3, 0]\n\nBut I'm not certain. Alternatively, given the test input's rows:\n\nRow2: cluster in column3 (middle) \u2192 output [0,2,0]\n\nRow3: clusters in columns2 and3 (middle) \u2192 output [2,3,0]\n\nBut in Example0, the third row's output is [0,0,2], which is a cluster in column4 (right of a 7-column input). For a 6-column input, column3 is middle. So row2's cluster in column3 would be middle \u2192 output [0,2,0]. Row3's clusters in columns2 and3 (middle) are adjacent. So output [2,3,0].\n\nThus, the final output would be:\n\n[0,2,0]\n\n[2,3,0]\n\nBut according to Example0's row3 output [2,2,3], which has three elements for two clusters (2,2 and 3) in middle and right. So maybe in the test input's row3, the two clusters (2 and3) are considered as one element, but no. I'm really not sure.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and the need to provide an answer, I'll proceed with the following output based on the closest matching example (Example0's row3):\n\nThe test input's row3 has two adjacent clusters (2 and3), so the output row is [2,3]. But according to Example0's row3, which has two clusters (2,2 and3), output [2,2,3]. So the test input's row3 would output [2,3]. However, the output needs to have rows with three elements. So maybe pad with 0s. Thus:\n\nRow2: [0,2,0]\n\nRow3: [2,3,0]\n\nBut how does this fit with Example2's output of two elements per row? Perhaps the number of elements depends on the number of clusters and their positions. Given the confusion, I'll output the following based on the test input and the examples:\n\nThe test input has two rows with non-1 numbers. The first row has a single 2 in the middle (column3 of 6 columns), so output [0,2,0]. The second row has two clusters (2 and3) in the middle columns, adjacent. So output [2,3,0]. But Example1's clusters separated by a 1 are output as [3,0,2], so adjacent clusters would be output as [2,3,0]. Thus, the final answer would be:\n\n[0,2,0]\n\n[2,3,0]\n\nBut looking at Example2's output, which has clusters in the middle columns, the output is [5,5], [5,5], [6,6]. So if the test input's row3 has two clusters in the middle, perhaps they are treated as a single cluster. But since they are different values (2 and3), they are separate. So the output should be two elements: [2,3], but the training examples show three elements per row. \n\nGiven the time and the examples, I'll proceed with the answer:",

        "cot_2": "Okay, let's see. I need to figure out the pattern from the training examples to apply it to the test input. Let me start by looking at the examples one by one.\n\nStarting with Example 0. The input is a 5-row matrix. The output has three rows. Each output row seems to have three elements. Let me compare the input and output.\n\nLooking at the first input row: [1,1,1,1,1,1,1]. The output starts with [2,2,0]. Hmm. Maybe the output is derived from the numbers in the input matrix that are greater than 1. Let's check.\n\nIn Example 0's input, the second row has 2s, the third has 2,2,3, and the fourth has a 2. The output rows are [2,2,0], [2,2,3], [0,0,2]. Wait, maybe the output is capturing the positions of the non-1 values in each layer or something. Alternatively, maybe it's grouping adjacent non-1 numbers.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is tracking clusters of numbers greater than 1. Let's see. The first output row in Example 0 is [2,2,0]. The input's second row has two 2s next to each other. The third row has two 2s and a 3. The fourth row has a single 2. But how does that translate to the output?\n\nWait, maybe the output is grouping consecutive non-1 elements in each column or row. Let me check the first example's output. The output has three rows, each with three elements. The input matrix has 5 rows and 7 columns. The output is 3 rows. Hmm.\n\nLooking at Example 1: the input is a 7x7 matrix. The output has two rows. The first input row where non-1 numbers appear is row 2 and 3, with 3s and 2s. The output is [3,0,2] and [3,0,2]. Maybe the numbers are the distinct non-1 values in each \"region\" or cluster, ordered in some way.\n\nWait, in Example 1's input, there's a 3 in column 3 and 2s in column 5 of rows 2 and 3. So the output has two rows. Each output row has 3, 0, 2. Perhaps each output row corresponds to a horizontal group of non-1 numbers, capturing the values. The 0 might indicate a gap or a missing value in the group.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each output entry represents a triplet of non-1 numbers in a vertical or horizontal scan. For example, in Example 0's input, the first non-1 group is two 2s in the second row. Then in the third row, there's two 2s and a 3. Then in the fourth row, a single 2. But how does that become the output rows?\n\nAnother approach: perhaps the output is grouping consecutive non-1 numbers in each column. Let's see Example 0's input:\n\nRow 2: [1,2,2,1,1,1,1] \u2192 columns 2 and 3 have 2s.\n\nRow 3: [1,2,2,3,1,1,1] \u2192 columns 2,3 (2s), column4 (3).\n\nRow4: [1,1,1,2,1,1,1] \u2192 column4 has 2.\n\nLooking at the output:\n\n[2,2,0] \u2192 maybe the first two 2s and then 0 (no third element).\n\n[2,2,3] \u2192 the three elements in the next group.\n\n[0,0,2] \u2192 maybe only the third element here.\n\nBut how does that form the output? Maybe the output rows correspond to vertical sequences of non-1 numbers in each column. Let's check.\n\nIn Example 0's input, columns 2 and 3 have 2s in rows 2 and 3, then back to 1. Column4 has 3 in row3 and 2 in row4. So perhaps each output row represents a vertical triplet. For column2: row2=2, row3=2, row4=1. So triplet [2,2,1] but in the output, the first output row has 2,2,0. Hmm, maybe 1 is considered as 0 here. So maybe any 1 is ignored, and non-1 numbers are considered, but when there's a 1, it's 0. So the vertical triplet for column2 would be [2,2,0], since row4 is 1. Then column3 similarly. Column4's triplet would be row3=3, row4=2, and maybe row5=1 (but row5 is [1,1,1,1,...], so row5 column4 is 1. So triplet [3,2,0]. But in the output, the second row is [2,2,3]. Hmm, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's looking at horizontal triplets. For example, in row2 of Example0: [1,2,2,1,1,1,1]. The non-1s are positions 2 and3. So a triplet could be [2,2,0] (since after the two 2s, next is 1 which is 0). Then row3: [1,2,2,3,1,1,1]. Non-1s are 2,2,3. So triplet [2,2,3]. Then row4: [1,1,1,2,1,1,1]. The triplet would be [0,0,2], because the 2 is in the fourth position. But how do these form the output rows? The output in Example0 is three rows. Each output row has three elements. So maybe each row of the output corresponds to a consecutive triplet in the input rows where there are non-1 numbers.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is capturing the values in contiguous blocks of non-1s across the rows, grouped vertically. For example, in Example0's input, columns 2 and 3 have 2s in rows 2 and 3. Then column4 has 3 in row3 and 2 in row4. So vertically, the groups could be:\n\nGroup1: 2 (row2, col2), 2 (row3, col2) \u2192 but how does that translate to [2,2,0]?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is formed by scanning each row and collecting the non-1 values, grouping them into triplets, padding with zeros if necessary. Let's check:\n\nExample0 input:\n\nRow2: 2,2 \u2192 triplet [2,2,0]\n\nRow3: 2,2,3 \u2192 triplet [2,2,3]\n\nRow4: 2 \u2192 triplet [0,0,2] (maybe centered?)\n\nBut the output has three rows matching these. So the output rows correspond to the input rows where there are non-1 elements, and each output row is the non-1 elements in that input row, padded with zeros to make triplets, or arranged in some way.\n\nWait in Example0, the output has three rows. The input rows with non-1 elements are rows 2,3,4. Each output row corresponds to those. For example:\n\nRow2 in input: two 2s \u2192 output [2,2,0]\n\nRow3: two 2s and a 3 \u2192 [2,2,3]\n\nRow4: one 2 \u2192 [0,0,2] (maybe centered?)\n\nBut why in row4's output, the 2 is in the third position. Maybe the non-1 elements are placed in the output row, centered, with zeros filling the rest. For example, if there's one element, it's in the middle. Wait, row4 has one 2. If centered in a triplet, it would be [0,2,0], but the output is [0,0,2]. Hmm, maybe not. Alternatively, if the elements are left-aligned, but with a maximum of three elements. So for row4, the 2 is the third element? That doesn't make sense. Maybe the position of the non-1 elements in the input row determines their placement in the output triplet.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is capturing clusters of non-1 numbers in each row, and each cluster is represented as a triplet. For example, in row2 of Example0, there's a cluster of two 2s. Since the triplet can't be filled, it's [2,2,0]. Then row3 has a cluster of two 2s followed by a 3, so [2,2,3]. Row4's cluster is a single 2, so [0,0,2]. But how is that determined? Maybe the positions are right-aligned. For example, in row4, the 2 is in position 4 (columns 0-6). So the triplet would be in the rightmost position. Wait, but how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each output row is formed by taking the first three non-1 elements in the input row, padding with zero if there are fewer. But in row2 of Example0, there are two 2s, so first three non-1s would be [2,2,0]. Row3 has three, so [2,2,3]. Row4 has one, so [2,0,0]. But the output for row4 is [0,0,2]. So that doesn't fit. Hmm.\n\nLet's check another example. Example1's input has rows 2 and 3 with non-1s. Row2: [1,1,3,1,2,1,1]. So non-1s are 3 and 2. Row3 is the same. The output is two rows: [3,0,2] and [3,0,2]. So for each row with non-1s, the output is a triplet. But how are they arranged? For row2: 3 is in column3, then 2 in column5. So the triplet could be [3,0,2], with 0 in the middle. Maybe the positions are split into left, middle, right parts. For example, in a row with 7 elements, columns 0-2, 3, 4-6. Then any non-1 in left is first element, middle is second, right is third. So for row2 in Example1: 3 is in column3 (middle) and 2 is in column5 (right). So triplet would be [0 (no left), 3 (middle), 2 (right)] \u2192 but output is [3,0,2]. That doesn't fit. Alternatively, maybe the columns are split into three sections. For 7 columns, maybe 2,3,2. So columns 0-1, 2-4, 5-6. Then for row2 in Example1: 3 is in column2 (second section), 2 in column5 (third section). So triplet would be [0,3,2]. But the output is [3,0,2]. So that's not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is looking for the leftmost, middle, and rightmost non-1 in each row. For row2 in Example1: non-1s are 3 (column2) and 2 (column4). So the leftmost is 3, middle (since there's only two elements, maybe the middle is 0?), rightmost is 2. So the triplet is [3,0,2], which matches the output. For row3, same as row2, so same triplet. Hence the output has two rows. That makes sense. So the pattern could be: for each row in the input that contains non-1 elements, create a triplet where the first element is the leftmost non-1, the third element is the rightmost non-1, and the middle element is the non-1 in between if there are three or more, otherwise 0. If there's only two non-1s, the middle is 0. If there's only one non-1, then the left and middle are 0, right is the value.\n\nWait in Example0's row4: [1,1,1,2,1,1,1]. The only non-1 is in column3. So triplet would be [0,0,2], which matches the output. So that seems to fit.\n\nLet me check Example2. The input has non-1s in rows 2,3,4. Row2 and 3 have 5s, row4 has 6s. The output has three rows: [5,5], [5,5], [6,6]. Wait, but the output rows have two elements each, not three. So this contradicts the previous pattern. Hmm. So maybe the pattern isn't exactly the same across all examples. Let me look again.\n\nExample2's input:\n\nRow2: [1,5,5,1,1,1] \u2192 two 5s.\n\nRow3: same as row2.\n\nRow4: [1,6,6,1,1,1] \u2192 two 6s.\n\nThe output is three rows: each with two elements. So perhaps in this case, the output is capturing all the non-1 elements in each row, grouped as they are. So for rows with two non-1s, the output row is those two. But why in the first two examples, the outputs are triplets with zeros. So maybe the pattern is that when the input rows have non-1 elements, they are grouped into pairs or triplets depending on their arrangement.\n\nWait, maybe the output is capturing clusters of consecutive non-1s in each row. For Example0, each row's non-1s are consecutive. Row2: two 2s \u2192 output [2,2,0]. Row3: two 2s followed by a 3 \u2192 [2,2,3]. Row4: single 2 \u2192 [0,0,2]. But why the third element in row4 is 2. Maybe the idea is that each cluster is represented as a triplet. For a cluster of two elements, the third is zero. For a cluster of three, all three are present. For a single element, it's represented as [0,0, value]. But how does that work with Example2's output, which has pairs.\n\nWait Example2's output is three rows, each with two elements. The first two rows are [5,5], which match the two 5s in rows 2 and 3 of input. The third row is [6,6], which matches row4's two 6s. So the output here is simply listing the non-1 elements of each row, as a list, without padding. So why in Example0 and 1, the output has triplets with zeros?\n\nSo there's inconsistency. But maybe there's another pattern. Let's think about the dimensions.\n\nLooking at the input matrices and their outputs:\n\nExample0 input: 5 rows, 7 columns. Output: 3 rows, each with 3 elements. The non-1 rows are rows 2,3,4. So output rows correspond to these.\n\nExample1 input: 7 rows, 7 columns. Output: 2 rows, each 3 elements. The non-1 rows are rows 2 and 3.\n\nExample2 input: 7 rows, 6 columns. Output: 3 rows, each 2 elements. The non-1 rows are rows 2,3,4.\n\nTest input: 6 rows, 6 columns. The non-1 rows are rows 3 and 4.\n\nSo maybe the output is generated by taking each row of the input that contains non-1 elements and then processing them as follows: for each such row, group the non-1 elements into consecutive runs and represent each run as a list. If the run has 1 element, pad with zeros to make a triplet. If the run has two elements, pad with zero to make a triplet. If the run has three or more, take the first three. But this doesn't fit Example2's output. Or perhaps the output lists all the non-1 elements in each row, but grouped into pairs or triplets based on their positions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking the non-1 elements in each row and, for each such row, creating a list where each element is the value of a non-1 cell, arranged in the order they appear, and then splitting them into groups of three, padding with zeros if necessary. But in Example2, each row's non-1 elements are exactly two, so they form groups of two. But the output has three rows, each with two elements. Wait, Example2's input has three rows with non-1 elements (rows 2,3,4), each having two elements, so output is three rows of two elements each. So maybe the output is simply listing the non-1 elements of each row in the order they appear, without any grouping into triplets. But why in Example0 and 1, the outputs have triplets with zeros.\n\nWait, let's re-examine Example2's output. The input rows with non-1s:\n\nRow2: [1,5,5,1,1,1] \u2192 5,5 \u2192 output [5,5]\n\nRow3: same \u2192 [5,5]\n\nRow4: [1,6,6,1,1,1] \u2192 6,6 \u2192 [6,6]\n\nSo each row's non-1s are two elements, so output as pairs. So perhaps the output depends on the number of non-1 elements in the row. For example, if a row has two non-1s, output as a pair. If three, output as triplet. If one, output as single with zeros? But Example0's row4 has one non-1, output [0,0,2], which is a triplet. Example1's rows have two non-1s (3 and 2), but output is triplets [3,0,2]. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternative approach: Perhaps the output is created by considering the positions of the non-1 elements in the input matrix, and then outputting the values in those positions, but grouped vertically into columns. For example, in Example0's input:\n\nColumns with non-1s are columns2,3,4 (since row2: cols2,3; row3: 2,3,4; row4: col4). So vertically, for each column, extract the non-1 values. Then group them into triplets. For column2: rows2 and3 have 2s, row4 has 1. So triplet [2,2,0]. Column3: same as column2. Column4: row3 has 3, row4 has2. So triplet [3,2,0]. But the output of Example0 is:\n\n[2,2,0]\n\n[2,2,3]\n\n[0,0,2]\n\nNot sure. Alternatively, maybe each output row corresponds to a diagonal or some other pattern.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is generated by looking for the maximum consecutive non-1 elements in each row, and then for each such maximum consecutive group, take their values, pad with zeros to form triplets. For example, in Example0's row2: consecutive 2s \u2192 two elements, so [2,2,0]. Row3: consecutive 2s followed by 3 \u2192 three elements, so [2,2,3]. Row4: single 2 \u2192 [0,0,2]. But why the third position here?\n\nAlternatively, the output is arranged as follows: for each row with non-1 elements, find the leftmost, middle, and rightmost non-1 element, inserting 0 if none. For Example0's row2: two 2s. Leftmost is first 2, middle would be the second 2, rightmost is also the second 2. So triplet [2,2,0] (maybe rightmost is zero if there's no third element). But that's not clear. Alternatively, if the row has even number of non-1 elements, the middle is zero. For row2: two 2s \u2192 left is first 2, right is second 2, middle 0. So [2,0,2]. But that doesn't match Example0's output for row2, which is [2,2,0]. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, the output is capturing the non-1 elements in a way that when the non-1 elements are adjacent horizontally, their values are listed, and when there's a gap, zeros are inserted. For example, in Example0's row3: [1,2,2,3,1,1,1]. The non-1 elements are 2,2,3. So triplet [2,2,3]. Row2: 2,2 \u2192 [2,2,0]. Row4: 2 \u2192 [0,0,2]. This fits. For Example1's rows2 and3: [1,1,3,1,2,1,1]. The non-1s are 3 and 2. They are separated by a 1, so there's a gap. So the triplet would be [3,0,2]. Which matches the output.\n\nExample2's rows have two adjacent non-1s. So for each row, the output is [5,5] and [6,6]. But why no zeros? This contradicts the earlier pattern. Unless the pattern is that if the non-1 elements are consecutive and form a group of two, they are output as a pair. If they are separated, they form triplets with zeros. But how to distinguish between the two cases.\n\nAlternatively, the output lists all the non-1 elements in each row. For rows with exactly two consecutive non-1s, output as a pair. For rows with non-consecutive or more than two, output as triplet with zeros as needed.\n\nBut Example2's output is pairs, which would fit if the non-1s are consecutive. But Example0's row2 has two consecutive 2s, but output is triplet [2,2,0]. So that's conflicting.\n\nAnother angle: Looking at the test input:\n\nTest input:\n\n[1,1,1,1,1,1]\n\n[1,1,1,1,1,1]\n\n[1,1,1,2,1,1] \u2192 row3 has a single 2 in column4 (0-based column3)\n\n[1,1,2,3,1,1] \u2192 row4 has 2 in column2, 3 in column3\n\n[1,1,1,1,1,1]\n\n[1,1,1,1,1,1]\n\nSo the non-1 rows are row3 and row4.\n\nRow3: [1,1,1,2,1,1]. The non-1 is 2 at position3.\n\nRow4: [1,1,2,3,1,1]. Non-1s are 2 (position2) and 3 (position3).\n\nFollowing the previous patterns from examples:\n\nFor row3: single non-1. According to Example0's row4, the output would be [0,0,2].\n\nFor row4: two non-1s, consecutive. According to Example1's rows, which had two non-consecutive non-1s (3 and 2 separated by 1), output was [3,0,2]. But in row4 of the test input, the non-1s are consecutive (2 and 3). So how would that be represented? Like [2,3,0]?\n\nBut let's see Example0's row3: three non-1s (2,2,3) \u2192 output [2,2,3].\n\nExample2's row2 and3: two consecutive 5s \u2192 output [5,5].\n\nWait, so when non-1s are consecutive and form a group, in Example2 they are output as pairs. But in Example0's row2, two consecutive 2s are output as [2,2,0]. So why the difference?\n\nPerhaps the answer lies in the number of columns. Example0's input has 7 columns. Example2's input has 6 columns. The test input has 6 columns. Maybe the output format depends on the number of columns. For example, in matrices with even number of columns, output pairs; odd, triplets. Let's check:\n\nExample0: 7 columns \u2192 output triplets.\n\nExample1:7 columns \u2192 output triplets.\n\nExample2:6 columns \u2192 output pairs.\n\nTest input:6 columns \u2192 should output pairs.\n\nSo the pattern is: for each row with non-1 elements, the output is a list where the elements are the non-1 values, padded with zeros to make the length equal to half the number of columns (rounded up?), or perhaps based on the original input's column count. Wait, 7 columns in Example0 and1, output triplets. 6 columns in Example2 and test input, output pairs.\n\n7 divided by 2 is 3.5, rounded up to 4? No. Example0's output is triplets. 6 columns \u2192 3 per triplet. Wait, no. For 7 columns, maybe the output is triplet because there are three middle columns? Or perhaps the output is grouping non-1 elements into triplets if the input has 7 columns, pairs if 6. But how?\n\nAlternatively, the output for each row is the non-1 elements, and the length is determined by the maximum number of non-1 elements in any row of the input. For example, in Example0, maximum non-1 per row is 3 (row3). So output rows have 3 elements. In Example2, maximum per row is 2, so output is pairs.\n\nYes! That makes sense. Let's verify:\n\nExample0's input rows:\n\nRow2: 2 elements \u2192 triplet (pad with 0)\n\nRow3:3 elements \u2192 triplet\n\nRow4:1 \u2192 triplet (pad with 0s)\n\nOutput is triplets.\n\nExample1's input rows with non-1s have two elements each. But the output is triplets. Wait, no. Example1's output is two rows of triplets. So in Example1, the maximum non-1 per row is two, but the output is triplets. So this contradicts.\n\nHmm, maybe not. Example1's output for rows 2 and3 are triplets, but each row has two non-1s. So that approach is not it.\n\nAlternative approach: The output for each row is the non-1 elements, padded with zeros to a length of 3 if the input has more than 5 columns, and to 2 if it's 6 or less. But Example0 has 7 columns, output is triplets. Example2 has 6 columns, output pairs. Test input has 6 columns \u2192 output pairs. Example1 has 7 columns \u2192 triplets. That seems plausible.\n\nSo in the test input, the non-1 rows are row3 and4. Row3 has one non-1 (2), row4 has two (2 and3). Since the input has 6 columns, the output should be pairs. So for row3: [0,2], row4: [2,3]. But wait, how to handle the padding. Or maybe the non-1 elements are centered in the output pair or triplet.\n\nAlternatively, for even-numbered columns (like 6), the output pairs are the left and right parts. For example, each row is divided into two parts. For row3 of test input: [1,1,1,2,1,1]. The non-1 is in position3 (0-based). Divided into two parts: first three columns and last three. So the non-1 is in the second part. So the output pair would be [0,2]. For row4: [1,1,2,3,1,1]. Non-1s are in positions2 and3. Position2 is first part (columns0-2?), position3 is second part (columns3-5). So first part has 2, second has3. So pair [2,3]. Then the output would be two rows:\n\n[0,2]\n\n[2,3]\n\nBut looking back at Example2's output:\n\nEach row with non-1s has two elements in the middle (positions1 and2 in a 6-column row). Divided into two parts of three columns each. The non-1s are in positions1 and2 \u2192 first part. So the pair would be [5,5] as in the output. So that fits.\n\nSo the pattern is:\n\n- For each row with non-1 elements:\n\n   - If the input has 7 columns, split into three parts (left, middle, right). For each non-1 element, assign to the corresponding part. The output is a triplet where each element is the value of the first non-1 in each part, or 0 if none.\n\n   - If the input has 6 columns, split into two parts (left and right). Each part is three columns. Output a pair where each element is the value of the non-1 in each part, or 0 if none. If multiple non-1s in a part, take the first.\n\nBut how does this fit the examples?\n\nExample0 (7 columns):\n\nRow2: [1,2,2,1,1,1,1]. Split into three parts:\n\nLeft: columns0-2 \u2192 1,2,2 \u2192 non-1s are 2,2 \u2192 first is 2.\n\nMiddle: column3 \u21921.\n\nRight: columns4-6 \u21921,1,1.\n\nSo triplet would be [2,0,0]. But the output is [2,2,0]. Hmm, not matching.\n\nAlternative split for 7 columns: left 3 columns (0-2), middle 1 (3), right 3 (4-6). So for row2:\n\nLeft part: 1,2,2 \u2192 non-1s are 2,2. So take first as 2.\n\nMiddle part: 1 \u2192 0.\n\nRight part: all 1s \u2192 0.\n\nTriplet [2,0,0], but Example0's output for row2 is [2,2,0]. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, the split for 7 columns is left 2, middle 3, right 2. For row2:\n\nLeft 2: 1,2 \u2192 non-1 is 2.\n\nMiddle 3: 2,1,1 \u2192 non-1 is 2.\n\nRight 2:1,1 \u2192 0.\n\nTriplet [2,2,0]. Which matches the output.\n\nExample0 row3: [1,2,2,3,1,1,1].\n\nLeft 2: 1,2 \u2192 2.\n\nMiddle 3:2,3,1 \u2192 non-1s are 2,3 \u2192 take first 2.\n\nRight 2:1,1 \u21920.\n\nBut output is [2,2,3]. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternative idea: For each column, if it's a non-1, add it to the output. But pad each row's output to a certain length based on the number of columns. For example, 7 columns \u2192 3 elements. 6 columns \u2192 2 elements.\n\nBut how to determine which elements to take. Maybe take the first three non-1 elements for 7 columns, first two for 6. For example:\n\nExample0 row2 has two non-1s (2,2). For 7 columns, output first three \u2192 [2,2,0].\n\nRow3 has three non-1s (2,2,3) \u2192 [2,2,3].\n\nRow4 has one \u2192 [2,0,0], but output is [0,0,2]. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, take the last few elements. For row4's single 2 in 7 columns, output [0,0,2]. So perhaps the non-1 elements are placed at the end of the triplet. For Example0's row2, two 2s \u2192 [2,2,0]. Row3's three \u2192 [2,2,3]. Row4's one \u2192 [0,0,2]. This seems to be the case.\n\nSo the pattern could be: for each row with non-1 elements, create a list of the non-1 values, then pad to the required length (3 for 7 columns, 2 for 6) by adding zeros at the end. If the number of non-1s exceeds the required length, take the first n elements.\n\nWait, but Example0's row3 has three non-1s, which fits into triplet. Row2 has two, padded with zero. Row4 has one, padded with two zeros. So the required length is three for 7 columns. Similarly, in Example2, which has 6 columns, required length is two. So each row's non-1 elements are listed, and padded to the required length (3 or 2) with zeros at the end.\n\nBut Example2's output rows are [5,5], [5,5], [6,6]. Each row has two elements, which is the required length. For a row with two non-1s, no padding. For a row with three non-1s, take first two. But in Example0's row3, there are three non-1s, but the output is [2,2,3], which is three elements. So for 7 columns, required length is three. For 6 columns, required length is two. So the test input has 6 columns, required length two.\n\nSo applying this to the test input:\n\nTest input's non-1 rows:\n\nRow3: [1,1,1,2,1,1] \u2192 non-1 is 2. So list is [2], pad to two \u2192 [2, 0].\n\nRow4: [1,1,2,3,1,1] \u2192 non-1s are 2 and3. Required length two \u2192 [2,3].\n\nBut the outputs for Example0's row4 (7 columns) have one non-1, padded to three elements as [0,0,2]. But why? Because for 7 columns, required length is three. So in that case, perhaps the non-1s are right-aligned in the output list. For example, in row3 of test input (6 columns, required length two), the non-1 is 2. So right-aligned would be [0,2]. For row4: [2,3].\n\nBut Example0's row4 has one non-1, which in required length three \u2192 [0,0,2].\n\nSo the padding is done by adding zeros to the left to reach the required length, making the non-1 values right-aligned.\n\nSo for a row with non-1 elements, you take the list of those elements, right-align them in the output array of required length (3 for 7 columns, 2 for 6), padding with zeros on the left.\n\nLet's verify this:\n\nExample0 row2: two non-1s \u2192 [2,2]. Required length3 \u2192 right-aligned \u2192 [0,2,2]? But the output is [2,2,0]. No. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternative approach: Left-aligned, with zeros on the right.\n\nExample0 row2: [2,2] \u2192 [2,2,0].\n\nRow3: [2,2,3] \u2192 [2,2,3].\n\nRow4: [2] \u2192 [2,0,0]. But output is [0,0,2]. Doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. What if it's centered? For required length3, if one element, it's in the middle. For two elements, first two positions. For three, all. But row4's output is [0,0,2], which would mean right-aligned. So maybe padding is on the left.\n\nSo for required length3:\n\n- 1 element \u2192 [0,0, value]\n\n- 2 elements \u2192 [0, value1, value2]\n\n- 3 elements \u2192 [v1, v2, v3]\n\nExample0 row2 has two elements \u2192 [0,2,2]. But output is [2,2,0]. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, padding on the right:\n\n1 element \u2192 [value,0,0]\n\n2 \u2192 [v1,v2,0]\n\n3 \u2192 all.\n\nBut row4's output is [0,0,2]. This would require padding on the left.\n\nI'm getting stuck. Let's try to re-express the examples.\n\nExample0's output for row2: [2,2,0]. The non-1s are in columns2 and3 of a 7-column row. Output triplet [2,2,0]. Maybe the triplet represents the left, middle, and right sections. So columns0-2, 3, 4-6. For row2, columns2 and3 are 2 and1. Wait, row2 is [1,2,2,1,1,1,1]. So columns0:1, 1:2, 2:2, 3:1, etc. So the left section (0-2) has 2,2. Middle (3) is 1. Right (4-6) is all 1s. So output is [2,0,0]. But actual output is [2,2,0]. So not matching.\n\nAlternatively, sections are left (0-1), middle (2-4), right (5-6). For row2:\n\nLeft:0-1: 1,2 \u2192 non-1:2.\n\nMiddle:2-4:2,1,1 \u2192 non-1:2.\n\nRight:5-6:1,1 \u21920.\n\nOutput triplet [2,2,0]. Which matches. So the sections are left (columns0-1), middle (2-4), right (5-6) for 7 columns.\n\nIn this case, for each section, take the first non-1 value, or 0 if none.\n\nRow2:\n\nLeft:0-1: first non-1 is 2 (column1).\n\nMiddle:2-4: first non-1 is 2 (column2).\n\nRight:5-6: all 1s \u21920.\n\nTriplet [2,2,0].\n\nRow3 of Example0: [1,2,2,3,1,1,1]. Sections:\n\nLeft:0-1 \u21921,2 \u2192 non-1:2 (column1).\n\nMiddle:2-4 \u21922,3,1 \u2192 first non-1:2 (column2).\n\nRight:5-6 \u21921,1 \u21920.\n\nSo triplet [2,2,0]. But the actual output is [2,2,3]. Hmm, that doesn't fit.\n\nWait, maybe for the middle section, if there are multiple non-1s, they are all considered. Or take the maximum? Or sum?\n\nAlternatively, the sections are different. For 7 columns, split into three equal parts. 7 divided by 3 is 2 with remainder 1. So perhaps sections are left (columns0-2), middle (3-4), right (5-6). \n\nRow2:\n\nLeft:0-2 \u21921,2,2 \u2192 non-1s:2,2. Take first \u21922.\n\nMiddle:3-4 \u21921,1 \u21920.\n\nRight:5-6 \u21921,1 \u21920.\n\nTriplet [2,0,0]. Doesn't match output.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Maybe the pattern is more about the positions of non-1 elements relative to the center.\n\nAlternatively, the output triplet for 7 columns represents the left half, middle column, and right half. For 7 columns, middle is column3. So left is 0-2, middle 3, right4-6.\n\nRow2 of Example0:\n\nLeft0-2: 1,2,2 \u2192 non-1s are 2,2 \u2192 take first \u21922.\n\nMiddle3:1 \u21920.\n\nRight4-6:1,1,1 \u21920.\n\nTriplet [2,0,0]. But actual output is [2,2,0]. So no.\n\nAnother approach: For each non-1 element in the row, note its position. For 7 columns, the positions are 0-6. For each output triplet, the first element is the first non-1 in the first third of the row (positions0-2), second element is first non-1 in the middle third (positions3-4), third in the last third (5-6).\n\nRow2 of Example0: non-1s are in positions1 and2. First third (0-2) has 1 and 2. The first non-1 is position1 \u21922. Middle third (3-4) is 1 and1 \u21920. Last third (5-6) \u21920. So triplet [2,0,0]. Doesn't match.\n\nBut output is [2,2,0]. So perhaps for the triplet, each element is the count of non-1s in each third. But row2 has two non-1s in first third \u21922, others 0. Output would be [2,0,0]. No.\n\nAlternatively, the triplet represents the leftmost non-1, the middle non-1, and the rightmost non-1 in the row. For row2 of Example0, non-1s are at positions1 and2. Leftmost is 2, middle would be 2 (since there's two), rightmost is 2. So triplet [2,2,2]. But output is [2,2,0]. Doesn't fit.\n\nI'm stuck. Let's try to find another pattern.\n\nLooking at Example0's output:\n\nOutput rows:\n\n[2,2,0]\n\n[2,2,3]\n\n[0,0,2]\n\nThese correspond to input rows2,3,4.\n\nRow2's non-1s: two 2s.\n\nRow3's non-1s: two 2s and a 3.\n\nRow4's non-1: one 2.\n\nThe output for row2 is [2,2,0], which could be the two 2s and then 0. For row3, all three non-1s. For row4, 0s and the 2.\n\nSo maybe for each row, the output lists all non-1s, then pads with zeros to make a triplet. If there are more than three non-1s, take the first three.\n\nExample1's input rows have two non-1s (3 and 2), so output [3,0,2] \u2192 but why not [3,2,0]? Because in the input row, the 3 comes before the 2. So perhaps the output is ordered left to right, but padded to three elements. But in Example1's output, the triplet is [3,0,2]. The non-1s are in columns3 and5. So the output is [3 (col3), 0 (col4),2 (col5)]. So it's taking the non-1s in order, and inserting 0s for columns that have 1 between them. So 3 is first, then column4 is 1 \u2192 0, then column5 is 2. So the output triplet is [3,0,2].\n\nSo the pattern is: for each row with non-1 elements, create a list that includes the non-1 values in their respective positions, replacing 1s with 0s. Then, take the first three elements if the row length is 7 (since each row has 7 elements), but that would produce 7 elements. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the output is the non-1 elements in the row, with 0s inserted where there are 1s between them. For Example1's row2: [1,1,3,1,2,1,1]. The non-1s are 3 and 2, with a 1 between. So the output is [3,0,2]. For Example0's row2: two 2s consecutive \u2192 [2,2,0]. The third element is 0 because after the two 2s, there's a 1. Row3: three non-1s \u2192 [2,2,3]. Row4: single 2 \u2192 [0,0,2].\n\nSo the pattern could be: for each row with non-1 elements, list the non-1s in order, and insert 0s whenever there's a 1 between them. Then, trim or pad to three elements. For example:\n\nRow2 of Example0: 2,2 \u2192 [2,2,0].\n\nRow2 of Example1: 3, then 1, then 2 \u2192 [3,0,2].\n\nRow3 of Example0: 2,2,3 \u2192 [2,2,3].\n\nRow4 of Example0: 2 \u2192 [0,0,2] (assuming leading zeros for the empty spaces before the 2).\n\nBut why in row4 of Example0, the 2 is at the end. Maybe because the 2 is in column4 of a 7-column row. If the output is always three elements, perhaps the non-1 elements are placed in the triplet based on their column position. For example:\n\nIn a 7-column row, the first three columns (0-2), middle column3, and last three columns4-6. So:\n\n- Any non-1 in columns0-2 \u2192 first element of triplet.\n\n- Non-1 in column3 \u2192 second element.\n\n- Non-1 in columns4-6 \u2192 third element.\n\nIf there are multiple non-1s in a section, take the first one.\n\nExample0 row2: columns1 and2 are non-1. Both in the first section. So the first element is 2. The second and third sections have no non-1s. But the output is [2,2,0]. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, each triplet element corresponds to a particular column in the input row. For example, triplet elements are the values of columns2,3,4. So for row2 of Example0: columns2 is 2, column3 is 1, column4 is 1. So triplet [2,0,0]. But output is [2,2,0]. So no.\n\nAlternatively, triplet elements are columns1,3,5. For row2 of Example0: column1 is 2, column3 is 1, column5 is1 \u2192 triplet [2,0,0]. Doesn't match output.\n\nThis is really challenging. Maybe I need to look for another pattern.\n\nLooking at the output dimensions:\n\nExample0's input is 5x7. Output is 3x3.\n\nExample1's input is7x7. Output is2x3.\n\nExample2's input is7x6. Output is3x2.\n\nTest input is6x6. So output should be2x2.\n\nBut the test input has non-1 rows at rows3 and4. So two rows. Each row needs to be processed into two elements.\n\nIn row3 of test input: [1,1,1,2,1,1]. The non-1 is in column3. For a 6-column row, required output is two elements. Perhaps split into three columns each. First three columns (0-2) and last three (3-5).\n\nFirst part: columns0-2 \u21921,1,1 \u2192 no non-1s \u2192 0.\n\nSecond part: columns3-5 \u21922,1,1 \u2192 non-1 is 2 \u2192 2.\n\nSo output for row3 is [0,2].\n\nRow4: [1,1,2,3,1,1]. Columns0-2:1,1,2 \u2192 non-1 is2.\n\nColumns3-5:3,1,1 \u2192 non-1 is3.\n\nSo output for row4 is [2,3].\n\nSo the test output would be:\n\n[0,2]\n\n[2,3]\n\nBut looking at Example2's output, which is:\n\n[5,5]\n\n[5,5]\n\n[6,6]\n\nEach non-1 row has non-1s in columns1 and2 (for rows2 and3) and1 and2 in row4. For a 6-column row split into two parts:\n\nFirst part (0-2) for row2: [1,5,5]. Non-1s are5,5 \u2192 take first5.\n\nSecond part (3-5):1,1,1 \u21920.\n\nBut output is [5,5]. So perhaps for each part, if there are multiple non-1s, take all of them. But Example2's output for row2 is [5,5], which suggests that both non-1s are included. Since the required length is two for 6 columns, perhaps each part is allowed to have multiple elements.\n\nWait, but Example2's output has two elements per row, which matches the two non-1s per row. So in that case, the output is simply listing the non-1 elements, regardless of their positions. For example, row2 has two 5s \u2192 output [5,5]. Row4 has two 6s \u2192 [6,6].\n\nSo why in Example0 and1, the outputs are triplets with zeros, but in Example2, pairs. This suggests that the output format depends on the number of columns. So for 6 columns, output pairs. For 7, triplets.\n\nTest input has 6 columns \u2192 output pairs.\n\nSo the pattern is:\n\nFor each row in the input containing non-1 elements:\n\n- If the row has 7 columns, output a triplet consisting of the non-1 elements, padded with zeros to make three elements, in the order they appear. If there are more than three, take the first three.\n\n- If the row has 6 columns, output a pair consisting of the non-1 elements, padded with zeros to make two elements. If there are more than two, take the first two.\n\nBut Example2's rows have two non-1s, so output pairs. Example0's rows have two non-1s in a 7-column row \u2192 triplet padded with zero. Test input row3 has one non-1 \u2192 pair padded with zero.\n\nApplying this to the test input:\n\nRow3: [1,1,1,2,1,1] \u2192 non-1 is2. For 6 columns, output pair \u2192 [0,2] (assuming left-aligned, but how to pad).\n\nWait, in Example2's rows with two non-1s, output is [5,5], which is the two elements. So if the row has one non-1, perhaps the pair is [0, value].\n\nBut in the test input's row3, the non-1 is in the fourth column (0-based index3). For a 6-column row, split into two parts: first three columns and last three.\n\nRow3: first three columns (0-2): all 1s \u2192 0. Last three (3-5): 2,1,1 \u2192 non-1 is2. So pair [0,2].\n\nRow4: first three columns (0-2):2 \u2192 non-1. Last three (3-5):3 \u2192 non-1. So pair [2,3].\n\nThus, the test output would be two rows:\n\n[0,2]\n\n[2,3]\n\nBut looking back at Example2's output, the rows with non-1s in the first part (columns1-2) are output as [5,5] and [6,6], which suggests that the pair represents the non-1 elements in the first part and the second part. But in Example2's case, the non-1s are in the first part (columns1-2) \u2192 first part has two non-1s. But output is [5,5], which is two elements. So for the pair, perhaps both elements come from the same part. \n\nThis seems conflicting. But perhaps the pattern is to list all the non-1 elements in each row, grouped into pairs if the row has 6 columns, or triplets if 7 columns, padding with zeros at the end to reach the required length.\n\nSo for the test input:\n\nRow3: [2] \u2192 list is [2]. Pad to two \u2192 [2,0].\n\nRow4: [2,3] \u2192 list is [2,3]. No padding needed.\n\nBut in Example0's row4, the non-1 is [2], padded to three \u2192 [2,0,0]. But Example0's output is [0,0,2]. So this contradicts.\n\nAh, here's the key. In Example0's row4, the non-1 is at column3 (0-based), which is the fourth column in a 7-column row. For triplet output, perhaps the elements are ordered as left, middle, right. In a 7-column row, the middle column is 3. So the non-1 is in the middle \u2192 [0,0,2]. No, that doesn't fit. Because the non-1 is in column3 (middle column), so the triplet would be [0,2,0]. But output is [0,0,2].\n\nThis is really frustrating. I might need to make a best guess based on the examples.\n\nTest input has non-1 rows at row3 and4.\n\nRow3: [1,1,1,2,1,1] \u2192 non-1 is 2 at column3.\n\nRow4: [1,1,2,3,1,1] \u2192 non-1s at column2 (2) and3 (3).\n\nFor a 6-column row, required output pairs. \n\nLooking at Example2, which has 6 columns, each non-1 row has two elements, which are the non-1 values. So for the test input:\n\nRow3's non-1 is 2 \u2192 output pair [2]. But Example2 pads with another 5. So maybe it's [2, 0].\n\nRow4's non-1s are 2 and3 \u2192 output pair [2,3].\n\nBut in Example1, non-1 rows have two elements, but output is triplets. So how?\n\nAlternatively, the test input's output should be:\n\nFor row3: [0,2] (since it's in the right half of the row).\n\nFor row4: [2,3].\n\nSo the output would be:\n\n[0,2]\n\n[2,3]\n\nWhich would be formatted as:\n\n[0,2]\n\n[2,3]\n\nBut in the training examples, the output formats have the same number of elements per row. For example, Example0's output has three elements per row. Example1's output has three per row. Example2 has two per row.\n\nSo for the test input, the output would be two rows, each with two elements.\n\nThus, the final answer would be:\n\n[0, 2]\n\n[2, 3]\n\nBut how to format this. Looking at the training examples, the output is written as:\n\nIn Example0:\n\n[2, 2, 0]\n\n[2, 2, 3]\n\n[0, 0, 2]\n\nIn Example1:\n\n[3, 0, 2]\n\n[3, 0, 2]\n\nIn Example2:\n\n[5, 5]\n\n[5, 5]\n\n[6, 6]\n\nSo each output row is enclosed in brackets and elements are comma-separated.\n\nThus, for the test input, the answer should be:\n\n[0, 2]\n\n[2, 3]\n\nBut I need to verify if this matches the pattern.\n\nAnother observation: In Example0, the non-1s in row4 are in column3 (middle of 7 columns). The output triplet is [0,0,2]. Maybe the output triplet captures the non-1 elements in the right third. For 7 columns, the right third is columns5-6, but in row4, the non-1 is in column3. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, the output for 7 columns captures the non-1 elements in the order they appear, padded with zeros to three elements. For 6 columns, padded to two.\n\nTest input row3: [2] \u2192 [2,0]\n\nRow4: [2,3] \u2192 [2,3]\n\nThus, the output would be:\n\n[2,0]\n\n[2,3]\n\nBut looking at Example2's output, rows with two non-1s are [5,5], which lists them as is. So the test's row4 would be [2,3], which makes sense.\n\nBut row3's output would be [2,0]. However, in Example0's row4, the non-1 is in column3 (7 columns), output is [0,0,2], suggesting that the position of the non-1 affects the output. For example, if it's in the right half, the second element of the pair is used.\n\nAlternatively, for 6 columns, the pair represents the first and last non-1 in the row. If there's only one, it's the last element. So row3's non-1 is in column3, which is the second part (3-5) of the 6 columns. So the pair would be [0,2].\n\nRow4 has non-1s in columns2 and3. The first is in the first part (0-2), the second in the second part. So pair [2,3].\n\nThus, the test output would be:\n\n[0,2]\n\n[2,3]\n\nThis seems to fit with the examples."
