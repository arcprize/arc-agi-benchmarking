        "cot_1": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. So, we have these input and output pairs, and I need to find out how the input is transformed into the output. Let's start by looking at the examples one by one.\n\nStarting with Example 0. The input has three rows of numbers. The output is a 3x3 grid with mostly zeros and a 2 in the middle of the second row. Let me see the input rows:\n\nInput:\n[1, 0, 0, 5, 0, 1, 0]\n[0, 1, 0, 5, 1, 1, 1]\n[1, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0]\n\nOutput:\n[0, 0, 0]\n[0, 2, 0]\n[0, 0, 0]\n\nHmm. The output is 3 rows each with 3 elements. So maybe each input row is being transformed into a part of the output, but that's not clear. Let's check the elements. The middle of the output has a 2. Maybe the 5 in the input is a key here. Let's look at the positions of the 5 in each input row. In Example 0's input, each row has a 5 at index 3. So the fourth element is 5 in each row. But the output is three rows. Maybe the 5's position is a clue. Or perhaps the numbers around the 5 matter.\n\nLooking at Example 1's input:\n\nInput:\n[1, 1, 0, 5, 0, 1, 0]\n[0, 0, 1, 5, 1, 1, 1]\n[1, 1, 0, 5, 0, 1, 0]\n\nOutput:\n[0, 2, 0]\n[0, 0, 2]\n[0, 2, 0]\n\nHere, the output has 2s in positions that might correspond to some counts. For instance, in the first row of the output, the middle element is 2, and the second row has a 2 in the third position. The third row again middle. So perhaps there's a relation between elements around the 5 in each input row and the output.\n\nWait, each input row is of length 7. Let me count the elements. Each input row has 7 elements. The output is 3x3. Maybe the 5 is in the middle (position 3) of the input rows, and the output is constructed by looking at the elements before and after the 5. Let's see. For example, in Example 0's first input row: [1,0,0,5,0,1,0]. The elements around 5 are 0 (index 2) and 0 (index 4). So maybe the output is formed by combining these values from each row. But how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each output row is derived from the corresponding input row. Let's take Example 0's first input row. The output's first row is [0,0,0]. The input row has elements before 5 as [1,0,0] and after as [0,1,0]. Maybe the sum or some operation on those? But how does that lead to the output.\n\nWait the output in Example 0 has a 2 in the middle. Maybe each output row is formed by counting something in the input rows. Let's think differently. The input has three rows. The output is three rows, each with three elements. Maybe each element in the output corresponds to a position in a 3x3 grid, and the value is determined by some count from the input rows.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is a matrix where each cell counts the number of times a certain condition is met across the input rows. For example, each output cell (i,j) could be the count of something in the input's i-th row and j-th position, but adjusted.\n\nLooking at Example 0's output, the middle cell is 2. Let's check all input rows. Each input row has 5 in position 3. The elements around it are perhaps being summed. For example, the elements before 5 (positions 0-2) and after (positions 4-6) in each row. Let's see:\n\nIn Example 0:\n\nFirst row: before 5: [1,0,0], after 5: [0,1,0]. Maybe adding the first three and the last three elements? But how does that lead to 0,0,0 and 2 in the middle.\n\nAlternatively, maybe looking at pairs of elements across the three input rows. For example, the first element of each input row is 1,0,1. Summing them gives 2. But in the output of Example 0, the middle is 2. Hmm, not sure.\n\nWait, let's check the positions of the output. In Example 0's output, the middle of the middle row is 2. How does that relate to the inputs. Let's see the middle input row: [0,1,0,5,1,1,1]. The elements before 5 are [0,1,0], after are [1,1,1]. Maybe the output is created by some operation between the elements before and after the 5 in each row. Like multiplying or adding corresponding elements.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is 3x3, where each cell (i,j) is the sum of the j-th element in the i-th input row's left part (before 5) and the j-th element in the i-th input row's right part (after 5). Let's test this.\n\nFor Example 0:\n\nFirst input row: left part [1,0,0], right part [0,1,0]. Sum each position: 1+0=1, 0+1=1, 0+0=0. But the output's first row is [0,0,0]. That doesn't match. So maybe not.\n\nAnother idea: maybe the output is the sum of the left and right parts across all three rows. For instance, each output row is the sum of the left part of each input row and the right part. But how to get 3 elements per output row. Wait, each input row's left part is 3 elements, right part is 3 elements. So for each input row, left and right can form a 3x3 matrix? Maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for each input row, the left three elements and the right three elements (excluding the 5) are being compared. For example, the left part [a,b,c] and the right part [d,e,f]. Maybe the output is a grid where each cell (i,j) is 2 if the left part's i-th element and right part's j-th element are both 1 in any of the input rows. Wait, maybe not. Let's check.\n\nLooking at Example 0's input rows:\n\nRow 0: left [1,0,0], right [0,1,0]. Row 1: left [0,1,0], right [1,1,1]. Row 2: left [1,0,0], right [0,0,0].\n\nThe output for Example 0 is middle row has a 2. Let's see. Maybe for each row, the sum of left and right elements. For example, in row 1's left is [0,1,0], right [1,1,1]. Summing each position: 0+1=1, 1+1=2, 0+1=1. But the output row is [0,2,0]. So maybe if the sum is 2, then set 2, else 0. But in this case, the middle element would be 2, others 1. So maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's the count of how many times the sum of left and right elements in a certain position across the three rows is 2. Wait, let's think in terms of the output matrix being 3x3, where each position (i,j) represents the count of rows where left[i] and right[j] are both 1. For example, if in a row, left[i] is 1 and right[j] is 1, then that contributes 1 to cell (i,j). Then, multiply by 2 if that's the case. Let's test this.\n\nIn Example 0:\n\nRow 0: left is [1,0,0], right [0,1,0]. So for cell (0,0): 1*0=0. (0,1):1*1=1. (0,2):1*0=0. (1,0):0*0=0. (1,1):0*1=0. (1,2):0*0=0. (2,0):0*0=0. (2,1):0*1=0. (2,2):0*0=0. So row 0 contributes 1 to cell (0,1).\n\nRow 1: left [0,1,0], right [1,1,1]. So for cell (0,0):0*1=0. (0,1):0*1=0. (0,2):0*1=0. (1,0):1*1=1. (1,1):1*1=1. (1,2):1*1=1. (2,0):0*1=0. (2,1):0*1=0. (2,2):0*1=0. So row 1 contributes 1 to cells (1,0), (1,1), (1,2).\n\nRow 2: left [1,0,0], right [0,0,0]. All products are 0. So no contributions.\n\nNow, summing across all rows:\n\nCell (0,0): 0+0+0=0 \u2192 0\nCell (0,1):1 (from row0) +0 +0 =1 \u2192 but output in Example0's first row is [0,0,0], so this doesn't fit. Wait, the output in Example0 is [0,0,0], [0,2,0], [0,0,0]. The middle cell (1,1) is 2. According to this idea, cell (1,1) would get contributions from row1 (1). But how does that sum to 2? Maybe multiply by 2. Wait, maybe if in any row, left[i] and right[j] are both 1, then add 2 to cell (i,j). Let's check.\n\nIn Example0:\n\nRow0 contributes 1 to cell (0,1). So 2? But output's cell (0,1) is 0. Hmm, no. Wait maybe this is not the right approach.\n\nAnother angle: in the output, all numbers are 0 or 2. So perhaps whenever a certain condition is met, we place a 2. Let's look at Example1's output:\n\n[0,2,0]\n[0,0,2]\n[0,2,0]\n\nSo there are three 2s here. The input for Example1 has three rows. Each input row has left and right parts. Let's check:\n\nRow0: left [1,1,0], right [0,1,0]. So for each cell (i,j) in output, if left[i] and right[j] are 1, then 2. But row0's left is [1,1,0], right is [0,1,0]. So possible matches where left[i] and right[j] are 1:\n\ni=0: left[0] is 1, right[j] is 0 (j=0), 1 (j=1), 0 (j=2). So j=1. So cell (0,1) would get 2.\n\ni=1: left[1] is 1. Looking at right[j], j=0 (0), j=1 (1), j=2 (0). So cell (1,1) gets 2.\n\ni=2: left[2] is 0. So no.\n\nRow0 contributes 2 to cells (0,1) and (1,1) ?\n\nWait but the output for Example1's first row is [0,2,0], which is cell (0,1) as 2. So maybe each row contributes 2 to the cell where left[i] and right[j] are 1, but summed across all rows.\n\nWait in Example1:\n\nRow0: left [1,1,0], right [0,1,0]. So for each i in 0,1,2 (left elements) and j in 0,1,2 (right elements):\n\nCheck where left[i] and right[j] are both 1.\n\nIn row0:\n\nleft[0] =1, right[1] =1 \u2192 cell (0,1) +=2.\n\nleft[1] =1, right[1] =1 \u2192 cell (1,1) +=2.\n\nleft[2] =0, no.\n\nSo row0 contributes 2 to (0,1) and (1,1).\n\nRow1 input: [0,0,1,5,1,1,1]. Left [0,0,1], right [1,1,1]. Check:\n\nleft[0]=0 \u2192 no.\n\nleft[1]=0 \u2192 no.\n\nleft[2]=1. Right elements are 1,1,1. So cell (2,0), (2,1), (2,2) each get 2? Because left[2] is 1 and right[j] is 1 for all j. So row1 adds 2 to (2,0), (2,1), (2,2).\n\nRow2 input: same as row0, so contributes 2 to (0,1) and (1,1).\n\nSo total contributions:\n\n(0,1): 2 (row0) + 2 (row2) \u2192 4?\n\nBut the output in Example1's first row is [0,2,0]. That's cell (0,1) as 2. Hmm, this doesn't add up. So maybe each cell can only be 0 or 2, regardless of how many times the condition is met, but if it's met at least once, it's 2. But that doesn't explain why in Example0's output, the middle cell is 2. Let's check Example0.\n\nExample0's output is middle cell (1,1) as 2.\n\nLooking at the input rows:\n\nRow0: left [1,0,0], right [0,1,0]. So left[i] and right[j] where i and j are?\n\nFor row0:\n\nleft[0] =1, right[0] =0 \u2192 no.\n\nleft[0] and right[1] =1 \u2192 cell (0,1) \u2192 but output in Example0's first row is 0.\n\nHmm, not matching.\n\nMaybe the pattern is different. Let's consider the 5 in each input row as a separator. Each input row is split into left (first 3 elements), 5, right (next 3 elements). Then, the output is a 3x3 matrix where each cell (i,j) is 2 if the sum of left[i] and right[j] across all rows is even? Or maybe it's the count of rows where left[i] + right[j] is equal to 2.\n\nWait, let's see Example0's output. The middle cell is 2. Let's check how many times left[1] + right[1] across all rows equals 2. \n\nRow0: left[1] is 0, right[1] is 1 \u2192 sum 1. Not 2.\n\nRow1: left[1] is 1, right[1] is 1 \u2192 sum 2. So this row contributes.\n\nRow2: left[1] is 0, right[1] is 0 \u2192 sum 0. So total 1 contribution. But the output cell (1,1) is 2. So maybe each contribution is multiplied by 2. So if the sum is 2 in one row, then cell (i,j) is 2. If two rows, then 4, but since output only has 0 or 2, perhaps it's the number of times sum is 2 multiplied by 2. Wait in Example0, (1,1) sum is 2 in one row (row1), so 1*2=2. That fits. \n\nIn Example1's output, cell (0,1) is 2. Let's check:\n\nFor cell (0,1):\n\nRow0: left[0] =1, right[1] =1 \u2192 sum 2 \u2192 contributes 2.\n\nRow1: left[0] =0, right[1] =1 \u2192 sum 1 \u2192 no.\n\nRow2: same as row0 \u2192 contributes 2. Total sum would be 4, but output is 2. So this approach doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, the cell is 2 if there's at least one row where left[i] + right[j] equals 2. Otherwise 0. So in Example0's cell (1,1), only row1 contributes (sum 2), so 2. For Example1's cell (0,1), row0 and row2 both have sum 2 (1+1=2), but the output is 2, not 4. So maybe it's 2 if at least one occurrence, otherwise 0. Then, even if multiple rows contribute, it's still 2. \n\nBut in Example1's output, cell (2,2) is 2. Let's see:\n\nFor cell (2,2):\n\nRow0: left[2] =0, right[2] =0 \u2192 sum 0 \u2192 no.\n\nRow1: left[2] =1, right[2] =1 \u2192 sum 2 \u2192 yes. So contributes 2.\n\nRow2: left[2] =0, right[2] =0 \u2192 sum 0. So cell (2,2) is 2. But in Example1's output, the second row's third element is 2 (cell (1,2)). Wait maybe I'm mixing the indices. Wait the output rows are three, each with three elements. So cell (i,j) where i is the row index (0,1,2) and j is the column index (0,1,2).\n\nIn Example1's output, the middle row is [0,0,2], which is cell (1,2) as 2. Let's check for cell (1,2):\n\nleft[i=1] and right[j=2].\n\nLooking at each input row:\n\nRow0: left[1] is 1, right[2] is 0 \u2192 sum 1 \u2192 no.\n\nRow1: left[1] is 0, right[2] is 1 \u2192 sum 1 \u2192 no.\n\nRow2: left[1] is 1, right[2] is 0 \u2192 sum 1 \u2192 no. So why is cell (1,2) 2 in Example1's output? That doesn't fit. So maybe this approach is incorrect.\n\nAlternative idea: Maybe the output is a 3x3 grid where each cell (i,j) is 2 if the sum of the i-th element of the left part and the j-th element of the right part across all input rows is exactly 2. Let's check Example0.\n\nExample0:\n\nFor cell (1,1):\n\nSum over all rows of left[1] + right[1].\n\nRow0: left[1] =0 + right[1] =1 \u2192 1.\n\nRow1: left[1] =1 + right[1] =1 \u2192 2.\n\nRow2: left[1] =0 + right[1] =0 \u2192 0.\n\nTotal sum: 1+2+0=3. But the output cell is 2. Doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. Let's think of another approach.\n\nLooking at the output grids, they all have 2s in certain positions, and zeros elsewhere. Maybe the 2s are placed where the corresponding positions in the input rows have a certain pattern. For example, in Example0's output, the middle cell (1,1) is 2. The input rows all have 5 in the middle. The middle input row (row1) has left [0,1,0] and right [1,1,1]. Maybe the middle row's left and right parts contribute to the middle cell.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each cell in the output is 2 if the sum of the left part's i-th element and the right part's j-th element in the same input row equals 1. Wait, but in Example0's output, the cell (1,1) is 2. For row1, left[1] is 1 and right[1] is 1 \u2192 sum 2. Not 1. So that doesn't work.\n\nAnother angle: the output could be the count of how many times the left part and right part, when arranged as vectors, form a certain condition. For example, when the left part is a row vector and the right part is a column vector, their dot product is 1, then 2. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is determined by the XOR of the left and right parts. For example, for each cell (i,j), if left[i] XOR right[j] is 1, then set to 2. Let's check Example0:\n\nRow0 left [1,0,0], right [0,1,0].\n\nFor cell (0,0): 1 XOR 0 =1 \u2192 2.\n\nBut output's first row is [0,0,0]. So this doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. Let's try to find another pattern.\n\nLooking at Example0's input rows:\n\nRow0: [1, 0, 0, 5, 0, 1, 0]\n\nRow1: [0, 1, 0, 5, 1, 1, 1]\n\nRow2: [1, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0]\n\nThe output is a 3x3 matrix where the middle cell is 2. How is this connected?\n\nPerhaps for each output row i, the elements are determined by the corresponding input row i. For example, the output row i is derived from input row i's left and right parts. But how?\n\nIn Example0's first input row: left [1,0,0], right [0,1,0]. The output's first row is [0,0,0]. How to get from the input row to the output row.\n\nMaybe for each position in the output row, if the left[i] and right[i] are both 1, then 2, else 0. But for input row0's left[0]=1, right[0]=0. So 0. left[1]=0, right[1]=1 \u2192 0. left[2]=0, right[2]=0 \u2192 0. So output [0,0,0], which matches. \n\nRow1 input: left [0,1,0], right [1,1,1]. For each position i:\n\ni=0: left[0]=0, right[0]=1 \u2192 0.\n\ni=1: left[1]=1, right[1]=1 \u2192 2.\n\ni=2: left[2]=0, right[2]=1 \u2192 0. So output row1 is [0,2,0], which matches.\n\nRow2 input: left [1,0,0], right [0,0,0]. All positions: 0. So output row2 is [0,0,0]. Which matches Example0's output.\n\nThis seems to fit! So the pattern is: For each input row, split into left (first three elements), 5, right (next three elements). For each output row (same index as input row), the output elements are [2 if left[i] and right[i] are both 1, else 0 for each position i in 0,1,2].\n\nWait, but in this case, for each output row, each element j is 2 if the left[j] and right[j] of the input row are both 1. Let's check Example1:\n\nExample1's input rows:\n\nRow0: left [1,1,0], right [0,1,0]. For each j:\n\nj=0: left[0]=1, right[0]=0 \u2192 0.\n\nj=1: left[1]=1, right[1]=1 \u2192 2.\n\nj=2: left[2]=0, right[2]=0 \u2192 0. So output row0 is [0,2,0], which matches the first row of Example1's output.\n\nRow1: left [0,0,1], right [1,1,1].\n\nj=0: 0 &1 \u21920.\n\nj=1: 0 &1 \u21920.\n\nj=2:1 &1 \u21922. So output row1 is [0,0,2], which matches the second row of Example1's output.\n\nRow2 is same as row0: output [0,2,0]. So the third row is [0,2,0]. But the Example1's output is:\n\n[0,2,0]\n\n[0,0,2]\n\n[0,2,0]\n\nWhich matches. So this pattern works for Example0 and Example1.\n\nLet's check Example2:\n\nExample2's input rows:\n\nRow0: [0,0,1,5,0,0,0]. left [0,0,1], right [0,0,0]. So output row0: 0 for all \u2192 [0,0,0].\n\nRow1: [1,1,0,5,1,0,1]. left [1,1,0], right [1,0,1]. For j=0: 1&1=1 \u21922. j=1:1&0=0. j=2:0&1=0. So output row1 is [2,0,0], which matches the second row of Example2's output.\n\nRow2: [0,1,1,5,1,0,1]. left [0,1,1], right [1,0,1]. For j=0:0&1=0. j=1:1&0=0. j=2:1&1=2. So output row2 is [0,0,2]. Which matches the third row of Example2's output.\n\nYes! This pattern works for all examples. So the rule is: For each input row, split into left (first three elements), then 5, then right (next three elements). The corresponding output row is [2 if left[j] and right[j] are both 1 else 0 for each j in 0,1,2].\n\nSo applying this to the test input:\n\nTest input:\n\n[1, 0, 1, 5, 1, 0, 1]\n\n[0, 1, 0, 5, 1, 0, 1]\n\n[1, 0, 1, 5, 0, 1, 0]\n\nProcessing each row:\n\nFirst row:\n\nleft = [1,0,1], right = [1,0,1].\n\nCheck for each j:\n\nj=0: 1 & 1 \u21921 \u21922.\n\nj=1:0 &0 \u21920 \u21920.\n\nj=2:1 &1 \u21921 \u21922.\n\nSo first output row: [2,0,2].\n\nSecond row:\n\nleft = [0,1,0], right = [1,0,1].\n\nj=0:0&1=0.\n\nj=1:1&0=0.\n\nj=2:0&1=0.\n\nSo output row: [0,0,0].\n\nThird row:\n\nleft = [1,0,1], right = [0,1,0].\n\nj=0:1&0=0.\n\nj=1:0&1=0.\n\nj=2:1&0=0.\n\nSo third output row: [0,0,0].\n\nWait but this gives:\n\n[2,0,2]\n\n[0,0,0]\n\n[0,0,0]\n\nBut looking at the training examples, each output row is a list with three elements. However, in Example1's output, there are multiple 2s in different rows. But according to this pattern, the test input's first row would have two 2s. But the training examples only have up to one 2 per row, except Example1's output where the middle row has a 2 in the third position, but other rows have one 2 each. \n\nWait wait, let me recheck the test input rows:\n\nFirst row: [1,0,1,5,1,0,1]. So left is [1,0,1], right is [1,0,1]. For j=0: left[0] is 1, right[0] is 1 \u21922. j=1: left[1] is 0, right[1] is 0 \u21920. j=2: left[2] is 1, right[2] is 1 \u21922. So the output row would be [2,0,2]. But looking at the training examples, they only have 0 or 2 per element, but they can have multiple 2s. For example, Example1's output has a row [0,0,2], and another [0,2,0]. So it's allowed.\n\nBut according to the pattern, this should be the correct answer. However, the problem is that the training examples may not have multiple 2s per row, but according to the rule derived, it's possible. Let me verify again.\n\nYes, the pattern is correct. So the test input's first row should generate [2,0,2], second row [0,0,0], third row [0,0,0]. \n\nBut wait, looking at the test input's third row: [1,0,1,5,0,1,0]. Left is [1,0,1], right is [0,1,0]. For j=0: 1 &0=0. j=1:0 &1=0. j=2:1 &0=0. So all zeros. \n\nBut according to this, the output would be:\n\n[2,0,2]\n\n[0,0,0]\n\n[0,0,0]\n\nBut looking at the training examples, the outputs have 0s and 2s, and in Example1, there are three 2s. So this seems valid. However, when I look back at the examples, perhaps there's an error in the pattern. Let me double-check.\n\nWait in Example2's first input row:\n\n[0,0,1,5,0,0,0]. left [0,0,1], right [0,0,0]. So j=0:0&0=0. j=1:0&0=0. j=2:1&0=0. So output row is [0,0,0], which matches.\n\nBut in Example2's third input row:\n\n[0,1,1,5,1,0,1]. left [0,1,1], right [1,0,1]. So j=0:0&1=0. j=1:1&0=0. j=2:1&1=1 \u21922. So output row is [0,0,2], which matches.\n\nSo yes, the pattern holds. Therefore, the test input's output should be:\n\nFirst row: [2,0,2]\n\nSecond row: [0,0,0]\n\nThird row: [0,0,0]\n\nBut wait, the training examples have outputs like Example1 where a row has two 2s. Wait no, in Example1's output, the rows are:\n\n[0,2,0]\n\n[0,0,2]\n\n[0,2,0]\n\nEach row has one 2. So in the test input's first row, there are two 2s. But according to the pattern derived, that's possible if two positions j have left[j] and right[j] as 1. For example, in the first input row of the test case, left and right are [1,0,1] and [1,0,1], so j=0 and j=2 are both 1. So output is [2,0,2]. \n\nBut the training examples don't have this scenario, but the pattern allows it. So the answer should follow this pattern.\n\nThus, the final output for the test input would be:\n\n[2, 0, 2]\n\n[0, 0, 0]\n\n[0, 0, 0]",

        "cot_2": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. So we have these input lists and output lists. Each input is a 3x7 grid (three rows, each with seven elements), and the output is a 3x3 grid. The examples show how the inputs are transformed into outputs, so I need to find the rule that connects them.\n\nLooking at Example 0:\n\nInput:\nRow 0: [1, 0, 0, 5, 0, 1, 0]\nRow 1: [0, 1, 0, 5, 1, 1, 1]\nRow 2: [1, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0]\n\nOutput:\n[0, 0, 0]\n[0, 2, 0]\n[0, 0, 0]\n\nHmm. The output here has a 2 in the center. Let me check other examples. \n\nIn Example 1:\n\nInput rows have various 1s and 0s. The output is a 3x3 matrix where positions (0,1), (1,2), and (2,1) are 2. Wait, the output there is:\n\n[0, 2, 0]\n[0, 0, 2]\n[0, 2, 0]\n\nWait, how does that relate to the input? Let's see the input for example 1:\n\nRow 0: [1,1,0,5,0,1,0]\nRow 1: [0,0,1,5,1,1,1]\nRow 2: [1,1,0,5,0,1,0]\n\nThe outputs have 2s in certain positions. Maybe the output is determined by some calculation based on the input's elements.\n\nAnother observation: the input rows all have a 5 in the fourth position (index 3). Maybe that's a separator or part of the pattern. Let me check. In all three examples, each input row has a 5 at index 3. So perhaps the elements before and after the 5 are being considered separately. Like, split each row into two parts: elements before 5 (indices 0-2) and after (indices 4-6). So each row is split into two parts of 3 elements each (since 5 is at index 3). Then maybe each part is summed or compared in some way.\n\nLooking at Example 0's input rows:\n\nRow 0: [1,0,0 | 5 | 0,1,0]\nRow 1: [0,1,0 |5 |1,1,1]\nRow 2: [1,0,0 |5 |0,0,0]\n\nThe left parts are [1,0,0], [0,1,0], [1,0,0], and the right parts are [0,1,0], [1,1,1], [0,0,0].\n\nThe output for Example 0 is a 3x3 grid with a 2 in the center. Let's see how that could be derived. Maybe the left and right parts are being used as coordinates or something. For example, each row's left part could represent a row in the output, and the right part a column. But how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each of the left and right triples are being converted into binary numbers. For example, the left part [1,0,0] is 4 (since 1*4 + 0*2 + 0*1), and the right part [0,1,0] is 2. But how does that relate to the output?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the sum of the left parts and the sum of the right parts in some way. For Example 0, row 0's left sum is 1, right sum is 1. Row 1's left sum is 1, right sum is 3. Row 2's left sum is 1, right sum is 0. Not sure how that gives the output.\n\nWait, the output is a 3x3 grid. Each cell in the output might correspond to a pair of positions from the left and right parts of the input rows. For instance, each output cell (i,j) is determined by looking at the ith row's left part and the jth row's right part, or something like that.\n\nAnother approach: maybe the output counts how many times a certain condition is met across the three rows. For instance, in the output matrix, each position (row, column) represents the count of a particular pattern across the three input rows.\n\nWait, let's look at Example 0's output. The center (1,1) is 2. The other positions are 0. How could that happen? Maybe each input row contributes to a position in the output. For each input row, maybe the left three bits (before 5) indicate the row of the output, and the right three bits (after 5) indicate the column. Then, the value at that position is incremented by some value. But how?\n\nWait, let's take Example 0's input:\n\nRow 0: left [1,0,0], right [0,1,0]. Let's think of the left as binary: 4 (100), right as 2 (010). If those are positions, maybe 4 and 2 are too big for a 3x3 matrix. So perhaps we take modulo 3 or something. Alternatively, sum of the left bits gives a row, and sum of the right bits gives a column. For row 0: left sum 1 (row 1?), right sum 1 (column 1). So adding 1 to (1,1). Then row 1: left sum 0+1+0=1 (row 1?), right sum 1+1+1=3 (column 3 mod 3 is 0). So (1,0). Row 2's left sum 1, right sum 0. So (1,0). Then, in Example 0's output, (1,1) is 1 (from row 0), (1,0) is 2 (from row 1 and 2), but the actual output has (1,1) as 2 and others as 0. So this might not fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the left and right parts each form a 3-element vector, and their dot product is calculated. But how that would lead to the output matrix. Hmm.\n\nWait, let's think of each input row as contributing to the output matrix. The input has three rows, so maybe each input row contributes to one cell in the output. But the output is 3x3, so three cells would be filled. But in Example 0, the output has only a single 2. So maybe each input row contributes to multiple cells.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the left part of each input row is a row in the output, and the right part is a column. Then, for each row in the input, take left part (3 elements) as a row in the output and right part (3 elements) as a column. But how that would combine. Maybe multiply left and right parts. For instance, if the left is a row vector and the right is a column vector, their product would be a 3x3 matrix. Then sum across all three input rows. Let's test this.\n\nFor Example 0:\n\nRow 0 left: [1,0,0], right: [0,1,0]. Their outer product would be:\n\n1*0, 1*1, 1*0\n0*0, 0*1, 0*0\n0*0, 0*1, 0*0\nWhich is:\n0 1 0\n0 0 0\n0 0 0\n\nRow 1 left: [0,1,0], right: [1,1,1]. Outer product:\n\n0*1=0, 0*1=0, 0*1=0\n1*1=1, 1*1=1, 1*1=1\n0*1=0, 0*1=0, 0*1=0\n\nRow 2 left: [1,0,0], right: [0,0,0]. Outer product all zeros.\n\nSumming all three:\n\nRow 0 outer sum: [0,1,0] from row 0, [0,0,0] from row 1, and [0,0,0] from row 2. Wait, no, each row's outer product is added to the sum. So row 0's matrix adds (0,0) 0, (0,1) 1, etc. Row 1's adds (1,0) 0, (1,1) 1, (1,2) 1, etc. Wait, no, the outer product for row 0 would be a 3x3 matrix where each element (i,j) is left[i] * right[j]. Then each input row contributes such a matrix, and all are summed. Let's compute the total sum for Example 0.\n\nRow 0's contribution:\n\nleft is [1,0,0], right is [0,1,0].\n\nMatrix:\nRow 0: 1*0=0, 1*1=1, 1*0=0\nRow 1: 0*0=0, 0*1=0, 0*0=0\nRow 2: 0*0=0, 0*1=0, 0*0=0\nSo:\n[0,1,0]\n[0,0,0]\n[0,0,0]\n\nRow 1's contribution:\n\nleft [0,1,0], right [1,1,1].\n\nMatrix:\nRow 0: 0*1=0, 0*1=0, 0*1=0\nRow 1: 1*1=1, 1*1=1, 1*1=1\nRow 2: 0*1=0, 0*1=0, 0*1=0\nSo:\n[0,0,0]\n[1,1,1]\n[0,0,0]\n\nRow 2's contribution:\n\nleft [1,0,0], right [0,0,0] \u2192 all zeros.\n\nSumming all three contributions:\n\nRow 0: 0+0+0=0, 1+0+0=1, 0+0+0=0 \u2192 [0,1,0]\nRow 1: 0+1+0=1, 0+1+0=1, 0+1+0=1 \u2192 [1,1,1]\nRow 2: 0+0+0=0, 0+0+0=0, 0+0+0=0 \u2192 [0,0,0]\n\nBut the actual output for Example 0 is:\n\n[0,0,0]\n[0,2,0]\n[0,0,0]\n\nHmm, this doesn't match. So maybe that's not the pattern. Alternatively, perhaps the outer product is taken and then multiplied by 2 if the middle element (the 5) is in the input row? Wait, in all input rows, the middle element is 5, so maybe that's a constant and not part of the calculation. Or maybe 5 is a separator.\n\nWait another thought: perhaps each of the three input rows contributes to a diagonal in the output. For example, the first row's elements after 5 determine the first row of the output, and before 5 determine columns. But that's unclear.\n\nLooking at Example 1's output:\n\n[0,2,0]\n[0,0,2]\n[0,2,0]\n\nSo there are 2s at (0,1), (1,2), (2,1). Let's look at the input rows for Example 1:\n\nRow 0: [1,1,0 |5| 0,1,0]\nRow 1: [0,0,1 |5|1,1,1]\nRow 2: [1,1,0 |5|0,1,0]\n\nSo left parts are [1,1,0], [0,0,1], [1,1,0]; right parts [0,1,0], [1,1,1], [0,1,0].\n\nIf we look for a pattern where each left and right part's positions are being matched. For example, maybe if the left part has a 1 in position i and the right part has a 1 in position j, then the output (i,j) is incremented. Let's see.\n\nIn Example 1, row 0's left is [1,1,0], right is [0,1,0]. So for left indices 0 and 1 (since they are 1), and right indices 1 (since it's 1), so pairs (0,1) and (1,1). So add 1 to (0,1) and (1,1) in the output. Then row 1's left is [0,0,1], right [1,1,1]. Left index 2, right indices 0,1,2. So pairs (2,0), (2,1), (2,2). Add 1 to each. Row 2's left is [1,1,0], right [0,1,0]. Same as row 0: (0,1), (1,1). So the total counts would be:\n\n(0,1): 2 (from row 0 and row 2)\n(1,1): 2 (from row 0 and row 2)\n(2,0): 1 (from row 1)\n(2,1): 1 (from row 1)\n(2,2): 1 (from row 1)\nBut the output for Example 1 has 2s at (0,1), (1,2), (2,1). That doesn't add up. So this approach might be wrong.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each position in the output is the product of the left part's elements and the right part's elements, summed across the three rows. For example, output[i][j] = sum over all input rows (left[i] * right[j]).\n\nLet's test this with Example 0.\n\nLeft parts:\n\nRow 0: [1,0,0]\nRow 1: [0,1,0]\nRow 2: [1,0,0]\n\nRight parts:\n\nRow 0: [0,1,0]\nRow 1: [1,1,1]\nRow 2: [0,0,0]\n\nFor output (0,0): sum of (1*0) + (0*1) + (1*0) = 0 +0 +0 =0\n(0,1): (1*1)+(0*1)+(1*0) =1+0+0=1\n(0,2): (1*0)+(0*1)+(1*0)=0+0+0=0\n(1,0): (0*0)+(1*1)+(0*0)=0+1+0=1\n(1,1): (0*1)+(1*1)+(0*0)=0+1+0=1\n(1,2): (0*0)+(1*1)+(0*0)=0+1+0=1\n(2,0): (0*0)+(0*1)+(0*0)=0+0+0=0\n(2,1): (0*1)+(0*1)+(0*0)=0+0+0=0\n(2,2): (0*0)+(0*1)+(0*0)=0+0+0=0\n\nSumming these would give a matrix like:\n\nRow 0: [0,1,0]\nRow 1: [1,1,1]\nRow 2: [0,0,0]\n\nBut the actual output is:\n\n[0,0,0]\n[0,2,0]\n[0,0,0]\n\nThis doesn't match. So maybe that's not it.\n\nAlternative approach: Maybe the output is determined by the number of times the sum of the left part equals the sum of the right part across all rows. But in Example 0, row 0: left sum 1, right sum 1. Row1: left sum 1, right sum3. Row2: left sum1, right sum0. So only row0 has sum equal. How would that translate to the output? Not sure.\n\nWait, in Example 0's output, the center is 2. Maybe the middle row and middle column are being considered. For instance, if the middle element of the left part is 1 and the middle of the right part is 1, then add 2 to the center. Let's check:\n\nExample 0, row 1's left part is [0,1,0], middle element 1. Right part [1,1,1], middle 1. So that's a match. So maybe each row contributes 1 to the output cell if left and right middle elements are 1. But in Example0's output, the center is 2. So two rows must have that condition. Let's see:\n\nIn Example0's input:\n\nRow0's left middle is 0 (left part [1,0,0] \u2192 middle index1 is 0). Right middle is 1 (right [0,1,0] \u2192 index1 is 1. So no match. So row0 doesn't contribute.\n\nRow1's left middle is 1, right middle is 1. So match. So contributes 1.\n\nRow2's left middle is 0, right middle is 0. So match (both 0). But in the output, the center is 2. So maybe adding 1 for each row where left and right middle elements are equal. Let's see:\n\nRow0: left middle 0 vs right middle 1 \u2192 no \u2192 0.\n\nRow1: left 1 vs right 1 \u2192 yes \u2192 1.\n\nRow2: left 0 vs right 0 \u2192 yes \u2192 1. Total 2. So output center is 2. Which matches Example0's output. But what about the other examples?\n\nLooking at Example1:\n\nInput rows:\n\nRow0: left [1,1,0] (middle 1), right [0,1,0] (middle 1 \u2192 match). So contributes 1.\n\nRow1: left [0,0,1] (middle 0), right [1,1,1] (middle 1 \u2192 no match). So 0.\n\nRow2: left [1,1,0] (middle 1), right [0,1,0] (middle 1 \u2192 match). So contributes 1. Total 2. But Example1's output has 2 in (0,1), (1,2), (2,1). Wait, this approach would only account for the center cell. So maybe this isn't the right pattern.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is a 3x3 grid where each cell (i,j) counts how many times the ith element of the left part and jth element of the right part are both 1 across all three input rows. Then multiply by 2 if there's a certain condition.\n\nIn Example0:\n\nLooking for pairs (i,j) where left[i] and right[j] are 1 in any row.\n\nRow0: left is [1,0,0], right is [0,1,0]. So left[0]=1, right[1]=1. So (0,1) \u2192 count 1.\n\nRow1: left [0,1,0], right [1,1,1]. Left[1]=1. So for j=0,1,2: (1,0), (1,1), (1,2) \u2192 each get 1.\n\nRow2: left [1,0,0], right [0,0,0]. No 1s in right. So no contributions.\n\nTotal counts:\n\n(0,1):1\n\n(1,0):1, (1,1):1, (1,2):1\n\nOther cells are 0.\n\nSo output would have these counts, but the actual output in Example0 is:\n\n[0,0,0]\n\n[0,2,0]\n\n[0,0,0]\n\nHmm, not matching. So maybe each count is multiplied by 2. For Example0's row0, (0,1) is 1 \u2192 2. Row1, (1,0), (1,1), (1,2) each 1 \u2192 2 each. But the output is only a 2 in the center. So that's not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each cell (i,j) is the number of rows where left[i] == right[j]. So for each row, compare left[i] and right[j], if equal, increment the count. Let's test this.\n\nExample0:\n\nRow0: left [1,0,0], right [0,1,0].\n\nFor i=0: left[0]=1 vs right[0]=0 \u2192 no. left[0] vs right[1]=1 \u2192 yes. left[0] vs right[2]=0 \u2192 no. So (0,1) +=1.\n\ni=1: left[1]=0 vs right[0]=0 \u2192 yes. (1,0) +=1. left[1]=0 vs right[1]=1 \u2192 no. left[1]=0 vs right[2]=0 \u2192 yes. So (1,2) +=1.\n\ni=2: left[2]=0 vs right[0]=0 \u2192 yes. (2,0) +=1. left[2] vs right[1]=1 \u2192 no. vs right[2]=0 \u2192 yes. (2,2) +=1.\n\nSo for row0, the cells (0,1), (1,0), (1,2), (2,0), (2,2) get incremented by 1.\n\nRow1: left [0,1,0], right [1,1,1].\n\ni=0: 0 vs1 \u2192 no. 0 vs1 \u2192 no. 0 vs1 \u2192 no. No increments.\n\ni=1:1 vs1 \u2192 yes. So (1,0), (1,1), (1,2) each get +1.\n\ni=2:0 vs1 \u2192 no. 0 vs1 \u2192 no. 0 vs1 \u2192 no.\n\nRow1 contributes (1,0), (1,1), (1,2) each +1.\n\nRow2: left [1,0,0], right [0,0,0].\n\ni=0:1 vs0 \u2192 no. 1 vs0 \u2192 no. 1 vs0 \u2192 no.\n\ni=1:0 vs0 \u2192 yes. So (1,0), (1,1), (1,2) each +1.\n\ni=2:0 vs0 \u2192 yes. So (2,0), (2,1), (2,2) each +1.\n\nSo row2 contributes (1,0), (1,1), (1,2), (2,0), (2,1), (2,2) each +1.\n\nNow sum all contributions:\n\n(0,1):1 (from row0)\n\n(1,0):1 (row0) +1 (row1) +1 (row2) \u2192 total 3.\n\n(1,1):0 (row0) +1 (row1) +1 (row2) \u2192 total 2.\n\n(1,2):1 (row0) +1 (row1) +1 (row2) \u2192 total 3.\n\n(2,0):1 (row0) +0 (row1) +1 (row2) \u2192 2.\n\n(2,2):1 (row0) +0 (row1) +1 (row2) \u2192 2.\n\nOthers:\n\n(2,1):1 (row2).\n\nSo the output matrix would have:\n\n[0,1,0]\n\n[3,2,3]\n\n[2,1,2]\n\nBut the actual output for Example0 is:\n\n[0,0,0]\n\n[0,2,0]\n\n[0,0,0]\n\nThis doesn't match. So this approach is wrong.\n\nAnother idea: Maybe the output is a 3x3 matrix where each cell (i,j) is 2 if the number of times the left part's i-th element and the right part's j-th element are both 1 across all input rows is exactly 2. Otherwise, 0. \n\nWait in Example0's output, the center (1,1) is 2. Let's see how many times left[1] and right[1] are both 1. \n\nLooking at the input rows:\n\nRow0: left[1] =0, right[1]=1 \u2192 no.\n\nRow1: left[1] =1, right[1]=1 \u2192 yes.\n\nRow2: left[1] =0, right[1]=0 \u2192 both 0. So count is 1 (row1). But output is 2. So that's not it.\n\nAlternatively, maybe count the number of times left[i] is 1 and right[j] is 1, then multiply by 2. \n\nIn Example0:\n\nFor (i,j)=(1,1):\n\nRow1: left[1] is 1 and right[1] is 1 \u2192 count 1. So 1*2=2. So (1,1)=2. Which matches Example0's output. \n\nFor other cells, any that have a count of 1 would be 2. But in Example0, all other cells are 0. So maybe this applies only if the count is exactly 1. \n\nWait, for Example0, the only cell with count 1 is (1,1). So (1,1) would be 2. Others are 0. Which matches Example0's output. Let's check Example1:\n\nExample1's input rows:\n\nRow0: left [1,1,0], right [0,1,0]. So left[0]=1, right[1]=1 \u2192 count (0,1) +=1.\n\nRow1: left [0,0,1], right [1,1,1]. left[2]=1, right[0],1,2=1. So (2,0), (2,1), (2,2) each +=1.\n\nRow2: left [1,1,0], right [0,1,0]. So (0,1) and (1,1) \u2192 left[0]=1, right[1]=1 \u2192 (0,1) +=1. left[1]=1, right[1]=1 \u2192 (1,1) +=1.\n\nSo the counts are:\n\n(0,1): 2 (from row0 and row2)\n\n(1,1):1 (row2)\n\n(2,0):1 (row1)\n\n(2,1):1 (row1)\n\n(2,2):1 (row1)\n\nSo multiplying by 2 would give:\n\n(0,1):2*2=4? But the output has (0,1)=2. So that's not matching. Unless we just count how many times it's 1 and multiply by 2.\n\nWait, in Example1's output, the cells with 2 are (0,1), (1,2), (2,1). So perhaps there's another pattern here.\n\nWait, in Example1's output:\n\n[0,2,0]\n\n[0,0,2]\n\n[0,2,0]\n\nLooking at (0,1) =2: that would mean two instances where left[0] and right[1] are 1. Let's see:\n\nRow0: left[0] is 1, right[1] is 1 \u2192 yes.\n\nRow2: left[0] is 1, right[1] is 1 \u2192 yes. So count is 2 \u2192 2*1=2. So (0,1) is 2.\n\n(1,2) in output is 2. That would mean left[1] and right[2] are 1 in two rows. Let's check:\n\nRow0: left[1] is 1, right[2] is 0 \u2192 no.\n\nRow1: left[1] is 0, right[2] is1 \u2192 no.\n\nRow2: left[1] is 1, right[2] is0 \u2192 no. Wait, that's zero instances. So that can't be right.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output cell (i,j) is 2 if exactly two rows have both left[i] and right[j] as 1. But in Example1's (1,2), there are zero instances. So that doesn't explain it.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's the sum of left[i] * right[j] across all three rows, multiplied by 2. Let's try that.\n\nFor Example0:\n\nOutput (1,1):\n\nsum over all rows (left[1] * right[1]):\n\nRow0: 0*1=0\n\nRow1:1*1=1\n\nRow2:0*0=0 \u2192 sum 1 \u2192 2*1=2. Which matches.\n\nFor Example1's (0,1):\n\nsum of left[0] * right[1] across rows:\n\nRow0:1*1=1\n\nRow1:0*1=0\n\nRow2:1*1=1 \u2192 sum 2 \u2192 2*2=4. But output is 2. So this doesn't fit.\n\nWait, but if it's just the sum multiplied by 1, then in Example1's (0,1), sum is 2, which matches the output's 2. Similarly for other cells.\n\nLet's test this hypothesis. For each cell (i,j), compute the sum of left[i] * right[j] across all three rows, and that's the output value.\n\nFor Example0:\n\n(1,1):\n\nRow0:0*1=0\n\nRow1:1*1=1\n\nRow2:0*0=0 \u2192 sum 1. But the output is 2. So this doesn't fit.\n\nBut Example0's output is 2 in (1,1). So maybe it's multiplied by 2.\n\nWait, then 1*2=2. That matches. Let's see:\n\nFor Example0's (1,1) sum is 1, multiply by 2 \u2192 2. Which matches.\n\nFor other cells in Example0:\n\nFor (0,0):\n\nRow0:1*0=0\n\nRow1:0*1=0\n\nRow2:1*0=0 \u2192 sum 0 \u2192 0.\n\nSimilarly for others. So Example0's output would be:\n\n[0,0,0]\n\n[0,2,0]\n\n[0,0,0]\n\nWhich matches. Now Example1:\n\nOutput cell (0,1):\n\nsum of left[0] * right[1] across all rows.\n\nRow0:1*1=1\n\nRow1:0*1=0\n\nRow2:1*1=1 \u2192 sum 2 \u2192 2*1=2. But according to the hypothesis, if multiplied by 2, it would be 4. But according to the output, it's 2. So maybe the sum is just left as is.\n\nWait, but in Example0, sum is 1, output is 2. So that contradicts.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each output cell (i,j) is twice the number of times left[i] and right[j] are both 1.\n\nExample0: (1,1) occurs once (row1) \u2192 2*1=2. Which fits.\n\nExample1's (0,1) occurs twice (row0 and row2) \u2192 2*2=4, but output is 2. So that doesn't fit.\n\nHmm, this is confusing. Maybe the answer is to look for the sum of left[i] XOR right[j], but that doesn't seem to fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output cell (i,j) is 2 if the sum of left[i] and right[j] across all rows is equal to 2. Let's check.\n\nFor Example0's (1,1):\n\nsum of left[i] across all rows for i=1:\n\nRow0:0, row1:1, row2:0 \u2192 sum 1.\n\nsum of right[j] for j=1:\n\nRow0:1, row1:1, row2:0 \u2192 sum 2.\n\nSo sum left[i] + sum right[j] = 1+2=3. Doesn't match.\n\nAlternatively, the product of sum left[i] and sum right[j]. 1*2=2. Which would give 2. But other cells would need to be checked.\n\nAlternatively, for each cell (i,j) in output: sum over all rows (left[i] + right[j]). In Example0's (1,1):\n\nRow0:0+1=1\n\nRow1:1+1=2\n\nRow2:0+0=0 \u2192 sum 1+2+0=3. But output is 2. Doesn't fit.\n\nI'm getting stuck here. Let's try to look for another pattern.\n\nAnother observation: the output for each example is a 3x3 matrix where the cells have 0 or 2. So perhaps the output is derived by something like doubling the count of a particular occurrence.\n\nLooking at Example2:\n\nInput:\n\nRow0: [0,0,1,5,0,0,0]\n\nRow1: [1,1,0,5,1,0,1]\n\nRow2: [0,1,1,5,1,0,1]\n\nOutput:\n\n[0,0,0]\n\n[2,0,0]\n\n[0,0,2]\n\nThe output has 2s at (1,0) and (2,2). Let's see why.\n\nFor (1,0): perhaps in row1, left[1] is 1, right[0] is1. So sum left[i] and right[j] for each row.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's based on the number of times left[i] is 1 and right[j] is 1 across all rows, multiplied by 2.\n\nFor Example2's (1,0):\n\nCheck left[1] and right[0] in all three rows:\n\nRow0: left[1] is0, right[0] is0 \u2192 no.\n\nRow1: left[1]=1, right[0]=1 \u2192 yes. Count 1.\n\nRow2: left[1]=1, right[0]=1 \u2192 yes. Count 2. So 2*2=4, but output is 2. So that's not matching.\n\nAlternatively, the count is 1 and multiplied by 2. For Example2's (1,0), how many times left[1] and right[0] are both 1? Row1 and row2: yes. So count 2 \u2192 2*2=4, but output is 2. Doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, count the number of rows where left[i] is not equal to right[j], and multiply by 2. Not sure.\n\nWait, let's try to find a different approach. Perhaps the output is a 3x3 matrix where each cell (i,j) is 2 if the sum of the ith left elements and jth right elements across all rows is even, and 0 otherwise. But in Example0, (1,1) sum left[i=1] across rows is 0+1+0=1. Sum right[j=1] across rows is 1+1+0=2. 1+2=3 \u2192 odd. Output is 2. So that's not.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's the sum of the products of left[i] and right[j] for each row, then multiplied by 2 if the sum is 1. For Example0's (1,1):\n\nRow0:0*1=0\n\nRow1:1*1=1\n\nRow2:0*0=0 \u2192 sum=1. Multiply by 2 \u2192 2. Which matches.\n\nFor Example1's (0,1):\n\nRow0:1*1=1\n\nRow1:0*1=0\n\nRow2:1*1=1 \u2192 sum=2. Which would be 2*2=4, but output is 2. So this doesn't fit.\n\nBut in Example1's output, (0,1) is 2. So sum is 2, multiplied by 1. So maybe the sum is directly the output.\n\nBut in Example0, sum is 1, output is 2. So this is conflicting.\n\nHmm. Let's try to find another angle. The output matrices in the examples seem to have exactly two 2s in Example1 and Example2. Example0 has one 2. Wait no: Example0's output has one 2. Example1's output has three 2s. Example2's output has two 2s. So the number of 2s varies. \n\nWait, Example1's output is:\n\n[0,2,0]\n\n[0,0,2]\n\n[0,2,0]\n\nSo three 2s. Example2's output has two.\n\nBut I'm not sure. Let's think differently. Maybe each row in the input contributes to a certain pattern in the output. For example, the first input row contributes to the first row of the output, the second to the second, etc. Let's see:\n\nExample0's input rows:\n\nRow0: [1,0,0,5,0,1,0]\n\nOutput row0: [0,0,0]\n\nRow1: [0,1,0,5,1,1,1]\n\nOutput row1: [0,2,0]\n\nRow2: [1,0,0,5,0,0,0]\n\nOutput row2: [0,0,0]\n\nSo perhaps the middle row of the input contributes to the middle row of the output. But how? The middle row's left part is [0,1,0], right part [1,1,1]. Maybe something with the sum. Left sum is 1, right sum is3. 1 and 3 are both odd. So 2 (since sum is even?). Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the middle element of the output row is 2 if the left sum and right sum of the input row are both 1. Like in Example0, row1's left sum is1, right sum3. But output is 2 in the middle. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAnother idea: maybe each output cell (i,j) is determined by the number of times the input's left[i] and right[j] are both 1 in the same row, multiplied by 2. So for each row, for each i and j, if left[i] and right[j] are 1, add 2 to output[i][j]. \n\nLet's test this with Example0:\n\nRow0: left[0]=1, right[1]=1 \u2192 add 2 to (0,1).\n\nRow1: left[1]=1, right[0]=1, right[1]=1, right[2]=1 \u2192 add 2 to (1,0), (1,1), (1,2).\n\nRow2: no 1s in right part \u2192 no additions.\n\nSo output would be:\n\n(0,1)=2\n\n(1,0)=2, (1,1)=2, (1,2)=2\n\nBut the actual output for Example0 is:\n\n[0,0,0]\n\n[0,2,0]\n\n[0,0,0]\n\nOnly (1,1) has 2. So this approach is incorrect. \n\nBut in the actual output of Example0, only the middle cell is 2. So perhaps for each row, if the left and right parts have a certain symmetry, then the center is incremented. For example, if the left and right parts are mirror images. \n\nRow1's left is [0,1,0], right is [1,1,1]. Not mirror images. But maybe if left and right parts have the same number of 1s. Row1 left sum 1, right sum3. Not same. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is created by comparing the left and right parts of each input row. If they are the same, then add 2 to the corresponding position in the output.\n\nBut in Example0's row0: left [1,0,0] vs right [0,1,0] \u2192 not same. So no addition. Row1: left [0,1,0], right [1,1,1] \u2192 no. Row2: left [1,0,0], right [0,0,0] \u2192 no. So how does Example0's output get a 2 in the center? This approach doesn't explain it.\n\nAnother thought: Maybe each output cell is the product of the sum of left[i] across all rows and the sum of right[j] across all rows. Then, multiply by 2 if it's non-zero.\n\nExample0:\n\nSum left[i] for each i:\n\ni=0: 1 (row0) +0 (row1) +1 (row2) =2\n\ni=1:0+1+0=1\n\ni=2:0+0+0=0\n\nSum right[j] for each j:\n\nj=0:0+1+0=1\n\nj=1:1+1+0=2\n\nj=2:0+1+0=1\n\nThen output cell (i,j) is (left_sum[i] * right_sum[j]) * 2.\n\nFor Example0's (1,1):\n\nleft_sum[1] =1, right_sum[1] =2 \u2192 1*2=2 \u2192 2*2=4. But output is 2. So no.\n\nAlternatively, without the multiplication by 2:\n\nleft_sum[i] * right_sum[j]. For (1,1) that's 1*2=2. Which matches the output. Let's check other cells.\n\nExample0's output should be all 0 except (1,1) =2.\n\nFor i=0, j=0: 2*1=2. But output cell (0,0) is 0. So that's not right.\n\nHmm.\n\nExample0's output is:\n\n[0,0,0]\n\n[0,2,0]\n\n[0,0,0]\n\nSo only (1,1) is 2. According to this approach, (0,0) would be 2*1=2, (0,1) 2*2=4, etc. So not matching.\n\nThis is getting frustrating. Let's try to look for another pattern.\n\nLooking at the outputs:\n\nEach output has 2s in positions that seem to form a diagonal or cross. For Example0, it's the center. For Example1, it's three cells forming a kind of diagonal. For Example2, it's two cells.\n\nPerhaps the output is a 3x3 matrix where each cell (i,j) is 2 if there exists an input row where left[i] is 1 and right[j] is 1, and 0 otherwise. But multiplied by the number of such rows. \n\nExample0:\n\nOnly row1 has left[i=1] =1 and right[j=1] =1. So output (1,1) =2. Which matches.\n\nExample1:\n\nRow0 has left[0]=1 and right[1]=1 \u2192 (0,1)=2 (since one row).\n\nRow1 has left[2]=1 and right[0,1,2]=1 \u2192 so (2,0), (2,1), (2,2) each get 2.\n\nRow2 has left[0]=1 and right[1]=1 \u2192 (0,1) +=2 \u2192 total 4, but output (0,1) is 2. So this doesn't work unless it's capped at 2.\n\nAlternatively, if the cell is 2 if there's at least one row where left[i] and right[j] are both 1. Then in Example1, (0,1) is 2, (2,0), (2,1), (2,2) are 2. But the output also has (1,2) as 2. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each cell (i,j) is 2 if exactly two input rows have left[i] and right[j] both 1. Let's check:\n\nExample0's (1,1): only row1. So not. So not.\n\nExample1's (0,1): two rows (row0 and row2). So 2*1=2. Which matches the output.\n\nExample1's (1,2): no rows. So 0. But output has (1,2) as 2. So this doesn't fit.\n\nHmm.\n\nLet's try to look for another pattern. Perhaps the output is determined by the sum of the left and right parts of each row, but in a certain way. For example, each row's left part is a binary number, and the right part is another binary number. The output could be the sum of these numbers for each row, modulo 3, but I don't see how.\n\nFor Example0's row0: left 100 (4), right 010 (2). Sum 6. Mod 3 is 0. Not sure.\n\nRow1: left 010 (2), right 111 (7). Sum 9 \u2192 mod 3 is 0.\n\nRow2: left 100 (4), right 000 (0). Sum 4. Mod3 is 1.\n\nBut the output is centered on (1,1). How this relates is unclear.\n\nAnother idea: Perhaps the output is a matrix where each cell (i,j) is 2 if the sum of the ith element of all left parts and the jth element of all right parts equals 2. \n\nFor Example0:\n\nSum of left parts across rows:\n\ni=0: 1+0+1=2\n\ni=1:0+1+0=1\n\ni=2:0+0+0=0\n\nSum of right parts across rows:\n\nj=0:0+1+0=1\n\nj=1:1+1+0=2\n\nj=2:0+1+0=1\n\nSo for cell (i,j) = sum_left[i] + sum_right[j]. If sum_left[i] + sum_right[j] = 2, then output 2. Otherwise 0.\n\nExample0:\n\nsum_left[0] =2, sum_right[0] =1 \u2192 3 \u2192 no.\n\nsum_left[0] + sum_right[1] =2+2=4 \u2192 no.\n\nsum_left[1] + sum_right[1] =1+2=3 \u2192 no.\n\nsum_left[0] + sum_right[2] =2+1=3 \u2192 no.\n\nOnly sum_left[0] =2, sum_right[1]=2 \u2192 4. So no cells meet the sum 2. But the output has (1,1)=2. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, if the product of sum_left[i] and sum_right[j] equals 2, then cell is 2. \n\nsum_left[0] =2, sum_right[1] =2 \u2192 product 4 \u2192 no.\n\nsum_left[1] =1, sum_right[1] =2 \u2192 product 2 \u2192 yes. So cell (1,1) is 2. Which matches Example0's output.\n\nLet's test this for Example0:\n\nsum_left[i] = [2,1,0]\n\nsum_right[j] = [1,2,1]\n\nProducts:\n\n(0,0):2*1=2 \u2192 cell is 2.\n\n(0,1):2*2=4 \u2192 no.\n\n(0,2):2*1=2 \u2192 cell 2.\n\n(1,0):1*1=1 \u2192 no.\n\n(1,1):1*2=2 \u2192 cell 2.\n\n(1,2):1*1=1 \u2192 no.\n\n(2,0):0*1=0 \u2192 no.\n\n(2,1):0*2=0 \u2192 no.\n\n(2,2):0*1=0 \u2192 no.\n\nSo the output would have cells (0,0), (0,2), (1,1) as 2. But Example0's output is only (1,1) as 2. So this doesn't fit.\n\nBut according to this, the output would be:\n\n[2,0,2]\n\n[0,2,0]\n\n[0,0,0]\n\nWhich doesn't match Example0's output. So this is incorrect.\n\nAnother approach: maybe each output cell (i,j) is 2 if the sum of the ith elements of the left parts across all rows equals 2, and the sum of the jth elements of the right parts across all rows equals 2. \n\nExample0:\n\nsum_left[i=0] =2, sum_right[j=1]=2 \u2192 cell (0,1) would be 2. But Example0's output has (1,1) as 2. sum_left[i=1] =1, sum_right[j=1]=2 \u2192 product is 1*2=2 \u2192 but sum_left[i=1] is 1, not 2. So this doesn't explain it.\n\nThis is really tricky. Let's look for another pattern. \n\nLooking at the test input:\n\nTest input:\n\nRow0: [1,0,1,5,1,0,1]\n\nRow1: [0,1,0,5,1,0,1]\n\nRow2: [1,0,1,5,0,1,0]\n\nWe need to find the output. But without knowing the pattern, it's hard. Let's think about possible patterns.\n\nIn the training examples, the output cells seem to correspond to positions where certain conditions are met in multiple rows. For example, in Example1's output, the 2s are in positions where either left[i] and right[j] are 1 in two different rows.\n\nAlternatively, the output is a 3x3 matrix where each cell (i,j) is 2 if there are exactly two input rows where left[i] is 1 and right[j] is 1. \n\nLet's check Example0:\n\nOnly row1 has left[i=1] and right[j=1] as 1. So cell (1,1) would be 2. Which matches.\n\nExample1's (0,1) has two rows (row0 and row2) where left[0]=1 and right[1]=1. So cell (0,1)=2*1=2. Similarly, row1 has left[2]=1 and right[2]=1. So cell (2,2) would have one row \u2192 no. But in the output, (1,2)=2. So perhaps row1's left[2]=1 and right[2]=1. So cell (2,2) would be 2, but Example1's output has (1,2)=2. Hmm, this doesn't fit. \n\nBut in Example1's output, (1,2)=2. Looking for rows where left[1] and right[2] are 1. \n\nRow0: left[1]=1, right[2]=0 \u2192 no.\n\nRow1: left[1]=0, right[2]=1 \u2192 no.\n\nRow2: left[1]=1, right[2]=0 \u2192 no. So count is 0. But output is 2. So this pattern isn't correct.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps the output cell (i,j) is 2 if the sum of left[i] and right[j] across all rows is 2. \n\nExample0's (1,1) sum left[1] is 1 (from row1) and sum right[1] is 2. 1+2=3 \u2192 no. So not.\n\nAlternatively, sum of left[i] across all rows and sum of right[j] across all rows, if their sum is even, then 2, else 0. \n\nExample0's (1,1): sum_left[1] is 1, sum_right[1] is 2. 1+2=3 \u2192 odd \u2192 0. Doesn't match.\n\nThis is taking too long. Let's try to think of the test input and see if any pattern emerges.\n\nTest input:\n\nRow0: left [1,0,1], right [1,0,1]\n\nRow1: left [0,1,0], right [1,0,1]\n\nRow2: left [1,0,1], right [0,1,0]\n\nIf the pattern is that each output cell (i,j) is 2 if the number of rows where left[i] and right[j] are both 1 is exactly 1. Then multiply by 2.\n\nFor each cell:\n\n(0,0): left[0] is 1 in row0 and row2. Right[0] is 1 in row0 and row1. So rows where both are 1: row0 and row2 (right[0] in row2 is 0, so no). Wait, row0: left[0] is 1, right[0] is1 \u2192 yes. row2: left[0] is1, right[0] is0 \u2192 no. So count is 1 \u2192 2*1=2.\n\nSimilarly:\n\n(0,1): left[0] is1 in rows 0 and 2. right[1] is0 in row0, 0 in row1, 1 in row2. So rows where left[0] and right[1] are 1: row2. So count 1 \u2192 2.\n\n(0,2): left[0] is1, right[2] is1 in row0 and row1. So rows where both are 1: row0 and row1. Count 2 \u2192 4. But output can only have 0 or 2, so maybe if count is even, 2, else 0. Not sure.\n\nBut this is speculative. Given the time constraints, I'll proceed with the pattern where each cell (i,j) is 2 times the number of rows where left[i] and right[j] are both 1.\n\nLet's apply this to the test input.\n\nTest input:\n\nRow0: left [1,0,1], right [1,0,1]\n\nRow1: left [0,1,0], right [1,0,1]\n\nRow2: left [1,0,1], right [0,1,0]\n\nFor each cell (i,j):\n\nCalculate how many rows have left[i] ==1 and right[j] ==1.\n\nFor (0,0):\n\nRow0: left[0]=1, right[0]=1 \u2192 yes.\n\nRow1: left[0]=0, right[0]=1 \u2192 no.\n\nRow2: left[0]=1, right[0]=0 \u2192 no.\n\nCount:1 \u2192 2*1=2.\n\n(0,1):\n\nRow0: right[1]=0 \u2192 no.\n\nRow1: right[1]=0 \u2192 no.\n\nRow2: right[1]=1 \u2192 left[0]=1 \u2192 yes.\n\nCount:1 \u2192 2.\n\n(0,2):\n\nRow0: right[2]=1 \u2192 yes.\n\nRow1: right[2]=1 \u2192 left[0]=0 \u2192 no.\n\nRow2: right[2]=0 \u2192 no.\n\nCount:1 \u2192 2.\n\n(1,0):\n\nRow0: left[1]=0 \u2192 no.\n\nRow1: left[1]=1, right[0]=1 \u2192 yes.\n\nRow2: left[1]=0 \u2192 no.\n\nCount:1 \u21922.\n\n(1,1):\n\nRow0: left[1]=0 \u2192 no.\n\nRow1: left[1]=1, right[1]=0 \u2192 no.\n\nRow2: left[1]=0 \u2192 no.\n\nCount:0 \u21920.\n\n(1,2):\n\nRow0: left[1]=0 \u2192 no.\n\nRow1: left[1]=1, right[2]=1 \u2192 yes.\n\nRow2: left[1]=0 \u2192 no.\n\nCount:1 \u21922.\n\n(2,0):\n\nRow0: left[2]=1, right[0]=1 \u2192 yes.\n\nRow1: left[2]=0 \u2192 no.\n\nRow2: left[2]=1, right[0]=0 \u2192 no.\n\nCount:1 \u21922.\n\n(2,1):\n\nRow0: left[2]=1, right[1]=0 \u2192 no.\n\nRow1: left[2]=0 \u2192 no.\n\nRow2: left[2]=1, right[1]=1 \u2192 yes.\n\nCount:1 \u21922.\n\n(2,2):\n\nRow0: left[2]=1, right[2]=1 \u2192 yes.\n\nRow1: left[2]=0 \u2192 no.\n\nRow2: left[2]=1, right[2]=0 \u2192 no.\n\nCount:1 \u21922.\n\nSo the output matrix would be:\n\n[2,2,2]\n\n[2,0,2]\n\n[2,2,2]\n\nBut looking at the training examples, none of them have all 2s. So this must be wrong. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is a 3x3 matrix where each cell (i,j) is 2 if the number of rows where left[i] and right[j] are both 1 is exactly 1. Then for the test input:\n\n(0,0) count 1 \u2192 2.\n\n(0,1) count 1 \u21922.\n\n(0,2) count 1 \u21922.\n\n(1,0) count 1 \u21922.\n\n(1,2) count 1 \u21922.\n\n(2,0) count 1 \u21922.\n\n(2,1) count 1 \u21922.\n\n(2,2) count 1 \u21922.\n\nSo output would have 2s in all cells except (1,1). But this seems unlikely. \n\nLooking back at the training examples:\n\nExample1's output has three 2s. So the pattern must allow for varying numbers of 2s. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is a 3x3 matrix where each cell (i,j) is 2 if the number of rows where left[i] is 1 and right[j] is 1 is exactly 2. \n\nBut in Example1's (0,1) cell, the count is 2 (rows 0 and 2), so 2*2=4 \u2192 output 4, which isn't possible. So this can't be.\n\nGiven that I'm running out of time and need to submit an answer, I'll proceed with the initial hypothesis that each cell (i,j) is twice the number of rows where left[i] and right[j] are both 1. \n\nApplying this to the test input:\n\n(0,0): 1 row \u2192 2*1=2.\n\n(0,1):1 row \u21922.\n\n(0,2):1 row \u21922.\n\n(1,0):1 row \u21922.\n\n(1,1):0 rows \u21920.\n\n(1,2):1 row \u21922.\n\n(2,0):1 row \u21922.\n\n(2,1):1 row \u21922.\n\n(2,2):1 row \u21922.\n\nSo output matrix:\n\n[2,2,2]\n\n[2,0,2]\n\n[2,2,2]\n\nBut the training examples have sparse 2s, so this might not be correct. Alternatively, perhaps there's a different pattern. \n\nLooking at Example2's output:\n\n[0,0,0]\n\n[2,0,0]\n\n[0,0,2]\n\nWhich suggests that (1,0) and (2,2) are 2. Let's see how this relates to the input:\n\nInput rows for Example2:\n\nRow0: left [0,0,1], right [0,0,0]\n\nRow1: left [1,1,0], right [1,0,1]\n\nRow2: left [0,1,1], right [1,0,1]\n\nSo for cell (1,0):\n\nLooking for rows where left[1] is1 and right[0] is1.\n\nRow0: left[1] is0 \u2192 no.\n\nRow1: left[1] is1, right[0] is1 \u2192 yes.\n\nRow2: left[1] is1, right[0] is1 \u2192 yes. Count=2 \u2192 2*2=4. But output is 2. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, the count is 1, multiplied by 2. So how?\n\nMaybe it's the number of times left[i] and right[j] are both 1, but only in certain positions. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output cell (i,j) is 2 if exactly one of the input rows has left[i] and right[j] as 1. \n\nFor Example2's (1,0):\n\nRow1 and row2 have left[1]=1 and right[0]=1 \u2192 count=2. So 2*1=2. But the output is 2. So if this is allowed even for counts >1, but multiplied by 1, then perhaps.\n\nBut this is not consistent with the previous examples.\n\nAt this point, I'm not confident, but I'll proceed with the initial pattern where each cell (i,j) is twice the number of rows where left[i] and right[j] are both 1.\n\nBut the test input's output would then be:\n\n[2,2,2]\n\n[2,0,2]\n\n[2,2,2]\n\nWhich doesn't match the style of the training examples. Maybe there's a mistake in this approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is the count of rows where left[i] and right[j] are both 1, multiplied by 2. So for test input:\n\nCell (0,0): 1 \u2192 2.\n\n(0,1):1 \u21922.\n\n(0,2):1 \u21922.\n\n(1,0):1 \u21922.\n\n(1,2):1 \u21922.\n\n(2,0):1 \u21922.\n\n(2,1):1 \u21922.\n\n(2,2):1 \u21922.\n\nBut this would lead to many 2s, which doesn't align with the training examples. \n\nPerhaps the correct pattern is that each cell (i,j) is 2 if the sum of left[i] and right[j] across all rows is 2. Let's check:\n\nFor test input:\n\nSum of left[i=0] across rows: 1 (row0) +0 (row1) +1 (row2) =2.\n\nSum of right[j=0] across rows:1 (row0) +1 (row1) +0 (row2) =2.\n\nSo sum_left[i=0] =2, sum_right[j=0] =2. Sum is 4. Not 2. So cell (0,0) would not be 2.\n\nAlternatively, product is 2*2=4. No.\n\nThis is not working. \n\nGiven time constraints, I'll proceed with the following answer based on the initial hypothesis:\n\nThe output is generated by counting for each cell (i,j) the number of rows where left[i] and right[j] are both 1, then multiplying by 2. \n\nApplying to the test input:\n\n[1,0,1,5,1,0,1]\n[0,1,0,5,1,0,1]\n[1,0,1,5,0,1,0]\n\nLeft parts:\n\nRow0: [1,0,1]\n\nRow1: [0,1,0]\n\nRow2: [1,0,1]\n\nRight parts:\n\nRow0: [1,0,1]\n\nRow1: [1,0,1]\n\nRow2: [0,1,0]\n\nNow, for each cell (i,j):\n\n(0,0): rows where left[0]=1 and right[0]=1 \u2192 row0 and row2 (row0's right[0]=1, row2's right[0]=0 \u2192 no). Only row0. Count=1 \u2192 2.\n\n(0,1): left[0]=1 and right[1]=0 (row0), 0 (row1), 1 (row2). Only row2 has right[1]=1. So count=1 \u21922.\n\n(0,2): left[0]=1 and right[2]=1 \u2192 row0 and row1. Right[2] for row0=1, row1=1. So count=2 \u21924 \u2192 but output can't be 4. So maybe 2 is the max, but the examples don't show this.\n\nThis approach is leading to inconsistencies. \n\nGiven that I'm stuck, I'll make an educated guess based on the training examples. The output seems to have 2s in positions that are diagonally opposite or form a certain pattern. For the test input, the output might be:\n\n[2,0,0]\n\n[0,0,2]\n\n[0,2,0]\n\nBut I'm not sure. However, looking at the test input:\n\nThe left parts are:\n\nRow0: [1,0,1]\n\nRow1: [0,1,0]\n\nRow2: [1,0,1]\n\nRight parts:\n\nRow0: [1,0,1]\n\nRow1: [1,0,1]\n\nRow2: [0,1,0]\n\nLooking for cases where left[i] and right[j] are 1:\n\nFor cell (0,0): row0 and row0 \u2192 yes. So count 1 \u21922.\n\nCell (2,2): row0 and row0's right[2]=1 \u2192 yes. So count 1 \u21922.\n\nCell (1,1): left[1] is 1 in row1 and right[1] is 0 in row1 \u2192 no. So 0.\n\nCell (2,1): left[2] in row0 is1, right[1] in row2 is1 \u2192 yes. So count 1 \u21922.\n\nCell (0,2): left[0] in row0 is1, right[2] in row0 is1 \u2192 yes. Count 1 \u21922.\n\nCell (1,2): left[1] in row1 is1, right[2] in row1 is1 \u2192 yes. Count 1 \u21922.\n\nCell (2,0): left[2] in row0 is1, right[0] in row0 is1 \u2192 yes. Count 1 \u21922.\n\nThis gives multiple 2s, but the training examples have sparse 2s. Given time constraints, I'll proceed with the following output:\n\n[2,0,2]\n\n[0,0,0]\n\n[2,0,2]\n\nBut this is a guess. However, looking back at the examples, the outputs often have 2s in positions corresponding to the middle of the rows or columns. For the test input, perhaps the output is:\n\n[0,2,0]\n\n[2,0,2]\n\n[0,2,0]\n\nBut this is a wild guess. \n\nGiven the time I've spent and the lack of a clear pattern, I think the correct approach is to count the number of rows where left[i] and right[j] are both 1 and multiply by 2. \n\nApplying this to the test input:\n\nThe answer would be:\n\nFor each cell (i,j):\n\nRow0's left and right: i=0: left[0]=1, j=0: right[0]=1 \u2192 count 1.\n\ni=0, j=2: left[0]=1, right[2]=1 \u2192 count 1.\n\nRow2's left and right: i=0: left[0]=1, j=0: right[0]=0 \u2192 no. i=0,j=2: left[0]=1, right[2]=0 \u2192 no.\n\nRow1: left[1]=1, j=0: right[0]=1 \u2192 count 1.\n\nSo cell (1,0): count 1 \u21922.\n\nSimilarly:\n\nBut this is taking too long, and I need to provide an answer. Based on the training examples, perhaps the output for the test input is:\n\n[0,2,0]\n\n[2,0,2]\n\n[0,2,0]\n\nBut I'm not confident. Looking at Example1's output, which has three 2s forming a diagonal. The test input might have a similar pattern. \n\nAlternatively, considering that each input row's left and right parts are mirrored or have certain symmetries. For example, the first row's left is [1,0,1], right is [1,0,1]. Which is a palindrome. So maybe contributes to certain cells. \n\nBut I'll stop here and provide the answer based on the initial hypothesis."
