        "cot_1": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. So, the problem is about transforming a 3x3 matrix (input) into another 3x3 matrix (output) based on some hidden rule. Let me look at the examples given and see if I can spot a pattern.\n\nStarting with Example 0:\n\nInput:\n[2, 2, 2]\n[3, 2, 3]\n[3, 3, 3]\n\nOutput:\n[5, 0, 0]\n[0, 5, 0]\n[0, 0, 5]\n\nHmm. The output has 5s in certain positions. Let's see where. The first row of output has 5 in the first position, the second row in the second, third row third. So it looks like a diagonal matrix with 5s on the diagonal. But how does that relate to the input?\n\nLooking at the input rows:\n\nFirst input row is [2,2,2]. The output row is [5,0,0]. So maybe the first row in the input is all the same number (2), and that corresponds to the 5 in the first position. Similarly, the third input row is all 3s, which in the output has 5 in the third position. The middle input row is [3,2,3], which has 3s in first and third positions but a 2 in the middle. The output here is [0,5,0], so the middle position gets the 5.\n\nWait, maybe each row in the output is 5 in the position where the corresponding input row has the maximum value. Let's check that.\n\nIn Example 0:\n\nFirst input row [2,2,2] \u2013 all same, so maybe it's considered that the maximum is in any position. But the output has 5 in the first. The third input row [3,3,3] also all same, output has 5 in third. The middle row is [3,2,3], the max is 3 in positions 0 and 2. But output is 5 in position 1. Hmm, that doesn't fit. Wait, maybe the maximum in the entire column?\n\nWait, maybe looking at columns instead. Let's check the columns for the input.\n\nIn Example 0, input columns:\n\nColumn 0: 2,3,3 \u2192 max is 3\nColumn 1: 2,2,3 \u2192 max is 3\nColumn 2: 2,3,3 \u2192 max is 3\n\nBut output has 5s on the diagonal. Maybe the output's 5s are placed where the row has the maximum value in the column. Let's see.\n\nFor the first output row [5,0,0], position 0. So column 0's max is 3 (from rows 2 and 3). Wait, maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps each row in the output corresponds to which column has the maximum in that particular row.\n\nWait, for example, in the first input row [2,2,2], all elements are equal. How does that determine the output? The output's first row is [5,0,0], which could mean that the first element is the maximum in that row. But since all are equal, maybe it's a default to the first position. Similarly, the third row in input is all 3s, so output third row has 5 in third position. But middle row [3,2,3] has two maxima (positions 0 and 2), but the output middle row has 5 in position 1. That doesn't fit. So that's confusing.\n\nLet's look at another example. Example 1:\n\nInput:\n[3,3,3]\n[4,2,2]\n[4,4,2]\n\nOutput:\n[0,0,5]\n[0,5,0]\n[5,0,0]\n\nThe output here has 5s in different positions. Let's check the input rows:\n\nFirst input row [3,3,3] \u2013 all same. Output is [0,0,5]. So 5 is in third position. Second input row [4,2,2] \u2013 max is 4 at position 0. Output is [0,5,0], which is position 1. Hmm, that doesn't match. Third input row [4,4,2] \u2013 max is 4 at positions 0 and 1. Output is [5,0,0], position 0. So maybe not the row's maximum.\n\nAlternatively, maybe looking at columns. Let's see the input columns:\n\nColumn 0: 3,4,4 \u2192 max is 4\nColumn 1: 3,2,4 \u2192 max is 4\nColumn 2: 3,2,2 \u2192 max is 3\n\nIn the output, the 5s are in positions (0,2), (1,1), (2,0). Hmm, (2,0) is row 2, column 0. Column 0's max is 4, which is in rows 1 and 2. So row 2 has 4 in column 0. So maybe for each column, the rows that have the maximum in that column get a 5 in their respective positions. Wait, that could be possible.\n\nLet me think. For each column, find which rows have the maximum value. Then, in the output matrix, for each such row and column position, place a 5. But how?\n\nWait, maybe each output row corresponds to a column in the input. Let me try to re-express.\n\nAnother approach: perhaps for each column in the input, determine the maximum value. Then, in the output matrix, for the row that has the maximum value in that column, place a 5 in that column's position, and 0s elsewhere. But how does that work with multiple rows having the max?\n\nWait, in Example 1, column 0's max is 4 (rows 1 and 2). So in column 0, output rows 1 and 2 would get a 5 in column 0? But the output for row 1 is [0,5,0], which is column 1. So that's conflicting.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is a diagonal matrix where the 5s are placed in the positions where the row's index equals the column's index, but only if that element is the maximum in its column. Let's see.\n\nIn Example 0, input columns:\n\nColumn 0: 2,3,3. Max is 3 (rows 1 and 2). So for column 0, which rows have the max? Rows 1 and 2. So in the output, for column 0, the 5 would be in the rows where they are the max. But in the output, column 0 has 5 in row 0, which isn't the case. So that doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. Let's try another angle. Let's look at the output for Example 0. It's a diagonal matrix with 5s. The input is three rows, all of which are either all 2s, mixed, and all 3s. The output diagonal suggests that each row in the output corresponds to a unique column. Maybe the diagonal elements are 5s when the row in the input has a unique maximum in that column. But I'm not sure.\n\nWait, maybe each row in the output corresponds to a row in the input, and each element in the output row is 5 if the corresponding column in the input has the maximum value in that row. Wait, let's check.\n\nFor Example 0:\n\nInput row 0: [2,2,2]. All elements are equal. So if we're looking for the maximum in the row, which would be 2. But in the output row 0, the first element is 5. So that's not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's the columns. For each row in the input, check which column has the maximum value in that row. Then, in the output row, set that column to 5 and others to 0. But in Example 0's first input row, all elements are 2, so all columns are equal. How to decide where to put the 5? Maybe default to the first position. So output row 0 would have 5 in column 0. For input row 1: [3,2,3], the max is 3 in columns 0 and 2. So output row 1 would have 5s in those columns? But the output is [0,5,0]. That doesn't fit. So this idea is not correct.\n\nLet's look at Example 2:\n\nInput:\n[4,4,4]\n[4,4,4]\n[4,4,4]\n\nOutput:\n[5,5,5]\n[0,0,0]\n[0,0,0]\n\nAll input rows are same. The output first row has all 5s. The others are zeros. So perhaps the first row in the output is 5s if all elements in the input are the same? But Example 3's input is all 3s and output is [5,5,5] in the first row. Wait, no, in Example 3:\n\nInput:\n[3,3,3]\n[3,3,3]\n[3,3,3]\n\nOutput:\n[5,5,5]\n[0,0,0]\n[0,0,0]\n\nSo output's first row is all 5s, others zero. So maybe when all rows are the same, the first output row is 5s. But how does that apply to other examples.\n\nWait, but in Example 4:\n\nInput:\n[4,4,4]\n[4,4,4]\n[3,3,3]\n\nOutput:\n[5,0,0]\n[0,5,0]\n[0,0,5]\n\nHere, the output is diagonal 5s. So the first two input rows are [4,4,4], and the third is [3,3,3]. The output has 5s in diagonal. So this suggests that when the input has rows that are not all the same, the output has 5s in a diagonal pattern. But when all rows are same (Examples 2 and 3), the first output row is all 5s and others zero.\n\nWait, perhaps the pattern is that in the output, each row has a 5 in the position corresponding to the index of the row in the original sorted input. Let me think: maybe the rows in the input are sorted in some order, and the output marks their original position.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rows in the input are sorted in ascending order, and the output matrix's 5s indicate their original positions. Let's see.\n\nTake Example 0:\n\nInput rows:\n\nRow0: [2,2,2]\n\nRow1: [3,2,3]\n\nRow2: [3,3,3]\n\nIf sorted in some order, maybe the rows with lower values come first. So sorted rows would be Row0, Row1, Row2. Then, in the output, the 5s are on the diagonal, meaning each row's original position is marked. But the output for Example 0 is diagonal 5s. Hmm, perhaps if the input rows are sorted in a certain way, the output 5s show their original indices. But in Example 1's output, the 5s are not diagonal. Let's check.\n\nExample 1 Input:\n\nRow0: [3,3,3]\n\nRow1: [4,2,2]\n\nRow2: [4,4,2]\n\nIf sorted in ascending order based on some criteria, maybe sum of elements or lex order. Let's compute sums:\n\nRow0 sum:9\n\nRow1 sum:8\n\nRow2 sum:10\n\nSo sorted by sum: Row1 (8), Row0 (9), Row2 (10). Original indices: 1,0,2. Then in the output, the 5s would be in the positions corresponding to their original indices. Output is:\n\n[0,0,5] \u2192 row0:5 in position 2 (original index 2?)\n\nWait, maybe not. This approach seems confusing.\n\nAlternative approach: Let's look for the position of 5 in each output row and see how it relates to the input.\n\nExample 0's output rows:\n\n[5,0,0] \u2192 5 in column 0\n\n[0,5,0] \u2192 column 1\n\n[0,0,5] \u2192 column 2\n\nSo for each row in output, the 5 is in the column equal to the row's index (row 0 has 5 in column 0, row 1 in column 1, row 2 in column 2). But how is that determined from the input?\n\nLooking at Example 0's input rows:\n\nRow0: [2,2,2]\n\nRow1: [3,2,3]\n\nRow2: [3,3,3]\n\nIf we sort the input rows in some order, perhaps based on their elements. Let's compare each row.\n\nRow0 is all 2s, Row1 is [3,2,3], Row2 is all 3s.\n\nIf we sort the rows in ascending order, perhaps Row0 (all 2s) is first, then Row1 (mixed), then Row2 (all 3s). But how does that relate to the output.\n\nThe output's 5s are diagonal, which could mean that the sorted order is the same as the original order, but that doesn't explain Example 1's output.\n\nExample 1's output is:\n\n[0,0,5] \u2192 5 in column 2\n\n[0,5,0] \u2192 column 1\n\n[5,0,0] \u2192 column 0\n\nSo the 5s are in columns 2,1,0. So row0 has 5 in column2, row1 in column1, row2 in column0. So the columns are in reverse order.\n\nWhat's the input for Example 1:\n\nRow0: [3,3,3]\n\nRow1: [4,2,2]\n\nRow2: [4,4,2]\n\nIf sorted in reverse order based on their maximum element, maybe:\n\nRow1 and Row2 have max 4, Row0 has max 3. So Row1 and Row2 come before Row0. But how does that order affect the output.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rows are sorted in a way that the output's 5s indicate their original positions. For example, sorted rows are Row2, Row1, Row0, and the 5s are placed in the columns corresponding to their original indices. So original Row0 is now in position2 (column2), Row1 in position1, Row2 in position0. That would make sense. So how are the rows sorted here?\n\nOriginal input for Example1:\n\nRow0: [3,3,3]\n\nRow1: [4,2,2]\n\nRow2: [4,4,2]\n\nIf we compare these rows, perhaps sorted in descending order. Let's compare each row lexicographically in reverse order.\n\nComparing Row1 and Row2:\n\nRow1: [4,2,2]\n\nRow2: [4,4,2]\n\nComparing element-wise:\n\nFirst element: same (4). Second element: Row2 has 4 > Row1's 2. So Row2 is larger. So the order would be Row2, Row1, Row0. Then, the original indices are:\n\nRow2 was original index2, now in position0.\n\nRow1 was index1, now in position1.\n\nRow0 was index0, now in position2.\n\nSo in the output, each row in the sorted list would have a 5 in the column corresponding to their original index. So sorted list:\n\nRow2 (original index2) \u2192 output row0 has 5 in column2 \u2192 [0,0,5]?\n\nWait, but the output for Example1 is:\n\n[0,0,5]\n\n[0,5,0]\n\n[5,0,0]\n\nSo row0 of output has 5 in column2, row1 in column1, row2 in column0. Which aligns with the original indices of the sorted rows. So sorted order is Row2, Row1, Row0. Then output row0 (which is Row2's original index2) \u2192 5 in column2. Output row1 (Row1's original index1) \u21925 in column1. Output row2 (Row0's original index0) \u21925 in column0. So that fits.\n\nSo the pattern is:\n\n- Sort the input rows in descending order (based on some criteria).\n- For each row in the sorted list, the output row has a 5 in the column corresponding to the original index of that row. All other elements are 0.\n\nBut what's the sorting criteria?\n\nLooking back at Example0:\n\nInput rows:\n\nRow0: [2,2,2]\n\nRow1: [3,2,3]\n\nRow2: [3,3,3]\n\nIf sorted in descending order:\n\nRow2 (all 3s) is highest.\n\nRow1: [3,2,3]\n\nRow0: all 2s.\n\nSo sorted order would be Row2, Row1, Row0. Original indices are 2,1,0.\n\nSo the output rows would be:\n\nRow0 (original index2): 5 in column2 \u2192 [0,0,5] ?\n\nBut the output for Example0 is:\n\n[5,0,0]\n\n[0,5,0]\n\n[0,0,5]\n\nWhich suggests that the sorted order is Row0, Row1, Row2. Because the output rows have 5s in columns 0,1,2 respectively. That would mean that the rows are sorted in their original order, which doesn't fit with the previous logic. So perhaps the sorting criteria isn't based on the row's elements.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rows are sorted based on their sum. Let's check:\n\nExample0:\n\nRow0 sum: 6\n\nRow1 sum: 8\n\nRow2 sum:9\n\nSo sorted descending order: Row2, Row1, Row0. Then output rows would have 5s in columns 2,1,0. But the actual output has 5s in 0,1,2. So this doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. This approach is leading me into confusion. Let's think differently.\n\nLet's look at the output matrices. In Examples 0 and 4, the output is a diagonal matrix with 5s. In Example 1, the 5s are in reverse diagonal. Examples 2 and 3 have the first row all 5s. So perhaps the diagonal is formed based on the rows of the input being unique in some way.\n\nWait, let's consider Example4:\n\nInput:\n\n[4,4,4]\n\n[4,4,4]\n\n[3,3,3]\n\nOutput:\n\n[5,0,0]\n\n[0,5,0]\n\n[0,0,5]\n\nHere, the first two input rows are the same (all 4s), and the third is different. The output is diagonal 5s. So maybe when there are duplicate rows, the output arranges them in a way that each 5 in the output corresponds to a unique row in the input. But how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 5s in the output are placed such that each 5 is in a different row and column. Like a permutation matrix. The permutation might be determined by the order of the rows sorted in a certain way.\n\nA permutation matrix has exactly one 1 (here 5) in each row and column. The examples seem to follow this pattern.\n\nSo the output is a permutation matrix where each 5 represents the position of the row after sorting. The permutation matrix's identity (diagonal) suggests that the rows are sorted in their original order. But in Example1, the output is the reverse diagonal, suggesting that the rows are sorted in reverse order.\n\nSo the key might be to sort the input rows in some order, then create a permutation matrix where each row's 5 indicates the original position of the row in the sorted list.\n\nSo the steps could be:\n\n1. Sort the input rows in a certain order (descending, perhaps based on some criteria).\n\n2. For each row in the sorted list, in the output matrix, place a 5 in the column that corresponds to the original index of that row.\n\nAll other elements are zero.\n\nThe question is: what is the sorting criteria for the rows?\n\nLooking back at the examples:\n\nExample0's input rows:\n\nRow0: [2,2,2]\n\nRow1: [3,2,3]\n\nRow2: [3,3,3]\n\nSorted in what order?\n\nIf sorted in descending order based on their first element:\n\nRow1 and Row2 start with 3, then Row0 with 2. But Row1 and Row2 are compared next elements. Row1: second element 2 vs Row2's 3. So Row2 comes first, then Row1, then Row0.\n\nBut in the output, the 5s are in diagonal, which would mean the sorted order is Row0, Row1, Row2. That doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rows are sorted in the order of their maximum values. Let's check:\n\nRow0 max: 2\n\nRow1 max:3\n\nRow2 max:3\n\nSo sorted by max descending would have Row1 and Row2 before Row0. But output 5s are diagonal, which implies original order. Not matching.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rows are sorted based on their entire row in lexicographical descending order.\n\nLexicographical order for rows compares element by element. For Example0:\n\nRow0: [2,2,2]\n\nRow1: [3,2,3]\n\nRow2: [3,3,3]\n\nIn lex order descending, Row2 comes first (since first element 3, which is higher than Row1's 3, but then second element 3>2). Then Row1, then Row0.\n\nSo sorted order would be Row2, Row1, Row0. Then the output matrix would have 5s in columns corresponding to their original indices:\n\nRow2 (original index2) \u2192 output row0: 5 in column2.\n\nRow1 (original index1) \u2192 output row1:5 in column1.\n\nRow0 (original index0) \u2192 output row2:5 in column0.\n\nSo the output would be:\n\n[0,0,5]\n\n[0,5,0]\n\n[5,0,0]\n\nBut the actual output for Example0 is diagonal 5s. So this contradicts.\n\nWait, but Example0's output is diagonal, which would imply that the rows are sorted in the same order as their original indices. So perhaps the rows are not sorted, but the output is diagonal. But in other examples like Example1, the output is not diagonal.\n\nThis suggests that the sorting criteria might vary, but how?\n\nAlternative approach: Let's check if the output is a permutation matrix where each 5's position corresponds to the row's original position if the input rows are unique. When there are duplicate rows, the first occurrence takes precedence.\n\nWait, in Example2 and 3 where all rows are same, the output's first row is all 5s, others zero. Which suggests that when all rows are the same, they are considered to be in their original positions, but only the first row is marked. But that doesn't fit with Example2's output being [5,5,5], [0,0,0], etc. Wait, in Example2's output, the first row is [5,5,5]. Hmm, perhaps when all rows are the same, all elements in the first output row are 5s. But why?\n\nThis is confusing. Let's look for another pattern.\n\nLooking at the input and output matrices, perhaps the sum of each row in the output is 5. Because in Example0's output rows each sum to 5. Example1's as well. Example2's first row sums to 15, but that's okay. Wait, no. Example2's output first row is [5,5,5] sum 15. Others are zero. So that's a problem.\n\nHmm. Alternatively, maybe the 5s represent the count of something. But not sure.\n\nLet me think of another angle. Let's look at the input matrices and their outputs. For Example0, the output is diagonal 5s. Input has rows: all 2s, [3,2,3], all 3s. The output's diagonal 5s could indicate that each row is the \"unique\" one in a particular column. But how?\n\nAlternatively, think of the output as representing the identity matrix scaled by 5, but rotated or permuted based on the input's row comparisons.\n\nAnother observation: In the output matrices, each column has exactly one 5. For example, Example0's output has 5s in column0,1,2. Example1's output has 5s in columns2,1,0. Example4's output has 5s in columns0,1,2. So the output is always a permutation matrix (each row and column has exactly one 5), except for Examples2 and 3 where all rows are the same, leading to first row all 5s and others zero.\n\nSo the general rule could be:\n\n- If all input rows are the same, output is [5,5,5] in the first row and zeros elsewhere.\n\n- Otherwise, the output is a permutation matrix where each row's 5 is in the column corresponding to the row's original position after sorting the input rows in a certain way.\n\nThe sorting order for the rows when they are not all the same needs to be determined.\n\nLooking at Example1, after sorting, the 5s are in columns 2,1,0. This suggests that the rows were sorted in reverse order of their original indices. For example, the original rows were [3,3,3], [4,2,2], [4,4,2]. Sorting them in reverse order would be [4,4,2], [4,2,2], [3,3,3]. Then the original indices are 2,1,0. So the output rows would have 5s in columns 2,1,0. Which matches the output of Example1.\n\nSo perhaps the rows are sorted in descending lex order, and the output's permutation matrix reflects their original indices.\n\nLet me check Example1's input:\n\nRow0: [3,3,3]\n\nRow1: [4,2,2]\n\nRow2: [4,4,2]\n\nComparing lex order descending:\n\nRow2: [4,4,2] is the largest.\n\nRow1: [4,2,2] comes next.\n\nRow0: [3,3,3] is the smallest.\n\nSo sorted rows are Row2, Row1, Row0. Their original indices are 2,1,0. So the output permutation matrix has 5s in column2 for the first output row (original index2), column1 for the second (original index1), and column0 for the third (original index0). Which matches Example1's output.\n\nExample0's input:\n\nRow0: [2,2,2]\n\nRow1: [3,2,3]\n\nRow2: [3,3,3]\n\nSorted lex descending:\n\nRow2: [3,3,3]\n\nRow1: [3,2,3]\n\nRow0: [2,2,2]\n\nSo sorted order is Row2, Row1, Row0. Their original indices are 2,1,0. So the output permutation matrix would have 5s in columns2,1,0. But the actual output for Example0 is diagonal 5s, which is columns0,1,2. This contradicts.\n\nWait, this suggests that the pattern I thought of works for Example1 but not Example0. So there must be a different criteria.\n\nAlternative approach: Maybe the rows are sorted based on their rows in reverse order. Let's compare the rows as numbers, comparing them in reverse order (i.e., first compare the last element, then the middle, then the first).\n\nFor Example0:\n\nRow0: [2,2,2]\n\nRow1: [3,2,3]\n\nRow2: [3,3,3]\n\nComparing in reverse order (element2, element1, element0):\n\nRow0: 2,2,2 \u2192 222\n\nRow1:3,2,3 \u2192323\n\nRow2:3,3,3 \u2192333\n\nSorted in reverse order would be Row2 (333), Row1 (323), Row0 (222). So the sorted order is Row2, Row1, Row0. Output would have 5s in columns2,1,0. But Example0's output is diagonal 5s (columns0,1,2). So this doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. Maybe the rows are sorted in ascending order lex, but that would give the opposite.\n\nExample0's rows in lex ascending order: Row0, Row1, Row2. So sorted order is Row0, Row1, Row2. Output permutation would be 5s in columns0,1,2. Which matches Example0's output.\n\nExample1's rows in lex ascending order:\n\nRow0: [3,3,3]\n\nRow1: [4,2,2]\n\nRow2: [4,4,2]\n\nComparing lex order, Row0 is [3,3,3], which is less than Row1 [4,2,2] (since 3 <4). Then Row1 is less than Row2 [4,4,2] (since 4=4, 2<4). So sorted order is Row0, Row1, Row2. So output permutation would be 5s in columns0,1,2. But the actual output is columns2,1,0. So this is conflicting.\n\nSo this idea is not correct.\n\nAlternative approach: Perhaps the rows are sorted based on the sum of their elements in descending order. Let's check.\n\nExample0:\n\nRow0 sum:6, Row1 sum:8, Row2 sum:9. Sorted descending: Row2, Row1, Row0. Output would be 5s in columns2,1,0. But Example0's output is columns0,1,2. Doesn't fit.\n\nExample1:\n\nRow0 sum:9, Row1 sum:8, Row2 sum:10. Sorted descending: Row2 (10), Row0 (9), Row1 (8). So sorted order Row2, Row0, Row1. Original indices:2,0,1. So output 5s would be in columns2,0,1. But Example1's output is columns2,1,0. Doesn't fit.\n\nSo this also doesn't work.\n\nHmm. Let's try to find another pattern. Let's look at the columns of the input matrices.\n\nIn Example0:\n\nEach column's maximum value is 3 in columns0 and 2, and 3 in column1 (rows1 and 2). But the output has 5s in each diagonal. Maybe for each column, the row that has the maximum value in that column gets a 5 in that column's position. But if there are multiple rows with the max, how is it handled?\n\nIn Example0, column0 has max 3 (rows1 and 2). Column1 max is 3 (row2). Column2 max is 3 (rows1 and 2). But output has 5s in row0, column0; row1, column1; row2, column2. So this doesn't fit.\n\nExample1's columns:\n\nColumn0:3,4,4 \u2192 max 4 (rows1 and 2)\n\nColumn1:3,2,4 \u2192 max4 (row2)\n\nColumn2:3,2,2 \u2192 max3 (row0)\n\nSo the output has 5s in row0 column2 (max of column2), row1 column1 (max of column1?), but column1's max is in row2. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternative idea: Maybe the output is based on the number of occurrences of the row in the input. For example, if a row is unique, it gets a 5 in a certain position. But I don't see how this applies.\n\nAnother thought: In the output matrix, each 5's position (i,j) indicates that the original row j is now in row i after sorting. So the output is a permutation matrix representing the sorting order.\n\nFor example, in Example1, the output is:\n\n[0,0,5] \u2192 row0 of output corresponds to original row2 (since column2 has 5).\n\n[0,5,0] \u2192 row1 corresponds to original row1.\n\n[5,0,0] \u2192 row2 corresponds to original row0.\n\nSo the sorted order is original row2, row1, row0. Which would be the case if the rows are sorted in descending order based on some criteria.\n\nThe question is, what criteria determines the sorted order of the rows.\n\nLooking back at Example1's input:\n\nRow0: [3,3,3]\n\nRow1: [4,2,2]\n\nRow2: [4,4,2]\n\nIf sorted in descending order based on the number of elements equal to the row's maximum.\n\nRow0's max is 3, all elements are 3 \u2192 count 3.\n\nRow1's max is 4, count1 (only first element).\n\nRow2's max is4, count2 (first and second elements).\n\nSo sorted by the count of max elements in descending order: Row0 (3), Row2 (2), Row1 (1). But output's sorted order is Row2, Row1, Row0. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, sorted by the first element descending, then second, then third.\n\nRow1 and Row2 start with4. Between them, Row2 has second element4 vs Row1's2. So Row2 comes before Row1. Then Row0 with3.\n\nSo sorted order: Row2, Row1, Row0. Which matches Example1's output.\n\nSo the rows are sorted in descending lex order. Then, the output permutation matrix represents the original indices of these sorted rows. So for each row in the sorted list, the output row has a 5 in the column equal to the original index of that row.\n\nLet's test this with Example0:\n\nInput rows:\n\nRow0: [2,2,2]\n\nRow1: [3,2,3]\n\nRow2: [3,3,3]\n\nSorted in descending lex order:\n\nRow2: [3,3,3]\n\nRow1: [3,2,3]\n\nRow0: [2,2,2]\n\nSo sorted order is Row2, Row1, Row0. Their original indices are 2,1,0. So the output matrix would be:\n\nRow0 (sorted first) \u2192 original index2 \u2192 5 in column2 \u2192 [0,0,5]\n\nRow1 (sorted second) \u2192 original index1 \u21925 in column1 \u2192[0,5,0]\n\nRow2 (sorted third) \u2192 original index0 \u21925 in column0 \u2192[5,0,0]\n\nBut the actual output for Example0 is diagonal 5s. So this contradicts. Therefore, this hypothesis is invalid.\n\nBut wait, the output for Example0 is diagonal, which would correspond to the sorted order being the same as the original order. So in Example0, the rows are already sorted in descending lex order. But Row0 is [2,2,2], which is less than Row1 [3,2,3], which is less than Row2 [3,3,3]. So sorted order should be Row2, Row1, Row0. Which is different from the original order. So why does the output have diagonal 5s?\n\nThis suggests that my hypothesis is incorrect. So I must be missing something.\n\nLet me look at Example4:\n\nInput:\n\n[4,4,4]\n\n[4,4,4]\n\n[3,3,3]\n\nOutput:\n\n[5,0,0]\n\n[0,5,0]\n\n[0,0,5]\n\nSo sorted in descending lex order:\n\nRow0 and Row1 (both [4,4,4]) come first, then Row2 [3,3,3].\n\nBut when two rows are identical, how are they ordered in the sorted list? Probably, they retain their original order. So sorted order would be Row0, Row1, Row2. So original indices are0,1,2. Thus, the output would have 5s in columns0,1,2, which is the diagonal. Which matches Example4's output.\n\nSo when rows are equal, they are kept in their original order. So the sorting is stable, preserving the original order for equal elements.\n\nIn Example0:\n\nInput rows are [2,2,2], [3,2,3], [3,3,3]. Sorted in descending lex order:\n\nRow2 ([3,3,3]), Row1 ([3,2,3]), Row0 ([2,2,2]).\n\nSo sorted order is Row2, Row1, Row0. But the output for Example0 is diagonal, implying that the sorted order is Row0, Row1, Row2. Which contradicts.\n\nThis is very confusing. There's clearly a pattern here that I'm not grasping. Let me try to find another angle.\n\nLet me look at the outputs where all rows are the same. In Examples2 and3, the output's first row is all 5s. So maybe when all rows are the same, the first output row is all 5s, others zero. But why?\n\nIn Example4, two rows are same and one different. Output is diagonal. So the rows are sorted with the two identical rows first, then the third. But the output is diagonal. So in this case, the first two rows are identical, and their original indices are0 and1, which are mapped to columns0 and1 in the output.\n\nWait, in Example4's input:\n\nRows0 and1 are [4,4,4]. Row2 is [3,3,3]. So when sorted in descending order, the first two rows are Row0 and Row1 (identical), followed by Row2. So sorted order is Row0, Row1, Row2. So the output permutation matrix would have 5s in columns0,1,2. Which matches the diagonal output.\n\nSo, for Example4, the sorted order is Row0, Row1, Row2. Because they are already in descending lex order (since they are identical except Row2). So the output is diagonal.\n\nSo this suggests that when the input rows are in descending lex order (with stable sorting for duplicates), the output is a diagonal matrix with 5s indicating the original positions. But how does this explain Example0's output?\n\nExample0's input rows are [2,2,2], [3,2,3], [3,3,3]. The sorted order in descending lex order is Row2, Row1, Row0. So the output should have 5s in columns2,1,0. But the actual output is diagonal 5s. This is a contradiction.\n\nThis suggests that there's a different sorting criteria. Maybe the rows are sorted in ascending order lex order.\n\nExample0's rows in ascending order would be Row0, Row1, Row2. So output 5s in columns0,1,2. Which matches the actual output.\n\nExample1's rows:\n\nRow0: [3,3,3]\n\nRow1: [4,2,2]\n\nRow2: [4,4,2]\n\nSorted in ascending lex order:\n\nRow0: [3,3,3]\n\nRow1: [4,2,2]\n\nRow2: [4,4,2]\n\nSo sorted order is Row0, Row1, Row2. Output permutation matrix would have 5s in columns0,1,2. But the actual output for Example1 is [0,0,5], [0,5,0], [5,0,0]. Which would correspond to columns2,1,0, implying sorted order is Row2, Row1, Row0. So this doesn't fit.\n\nSo this approach is not working.\n\nAlternative idea: Maybe the rows are not sorted at all. Instead, the output's 5s are determined by the number of times each row appears. For instance, in Example4, the first two rows are same and are each mapped to their original positions. But this doesn't explain the diagonal.\n\nAlternatively, the output's 5s are in the positions where the input row has the maximum value in its respective column. Let's check.\n\nFor Example0's input:\n\nColumns:\n\nCol0: [2,3,3] \u2192 max is3 at rows1 and 2.\n\nCol1: [2,2,3] \u2192 max is3 at row2.\n\nCol2: [2,3,3] \u2192 max is3 at rows1 and2.\n\nSo for each column, the rows with the max get a 5 in that column's position in their row.\n\nFor column0, rows1 and2 have max3. So in their respective rows (1 and 2), column0 should have a5. Similarly for other columns.\n\nBut the output for Example0 is:\n\n[5,0,0]\n\n[0,5,0]\n\n[0,0,5]\n\nRow0 has 5 in column0, but row0's elements in column0 is 2, which is not the max. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAnother idea: For each row, find the column where it is the unique maximum.\n\nFor example, in Example0:\n\nRow0: [2,2,2] \u2013 not the max in any column.\n\nRow1: [3,2,3] \u2013 in column0 and 2, it's max (3), but column0 has row2 also with3. So not unique.\n\nRow2: [3,3,3] \u2013 max in all columns.\n\nBut output row2 has 5 in column2, but row2 is max in all columns. So this doesn't fit.\n\nThis is really challenging. Let's try to look for another pattern.\n\nIn Example0's output, the diagonal 5s could represent that each row's index matches the column's index. So row0's 5 is in column0, etc. This would happen if the rows are sorted in their original order. But why would that be the case?\n\nIn Example4, the input rows are [4,4,4], [4,4,4], [3,3,3]. The output is diagonal 5s. This suggests that the rows are considered to be in their original order. But why? Because the first two rows are the same, but they're kept in their original order, then the third row.\n\nSo perhaps the sorting criteria is not changing the order of the rows. But then, why does Example1's output not follow this?\n\nExample1's input rows:\n\nRow0: [3,3,3]\n\nRow1: [4,2,2]\n\nRow2: [4,4,2]\n\nIf not sorted, the output would be diagonal 5s. But the actual output is 5s in columns2,1,0. So this implies the rows are sorted in reverse order.\n\nSo the pattern must be:\n\n- If all rows are the same, output first row all 5s, others zero.\n\n- Otherwise, sort the rows in reverse order of their original indices (i.e., reverse the order of the rows), and create a permutation matrix where each 5 indicates the original index.\n\nBut let's check:\n\nExample0's input is three rows. If reversed, the order would be Row2, Row1, Row0. Output would be 5s in columns2,1,0. But Example0's output is diagonal. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAnother approach: Maybe the output is determined by the row's position in the input when sorted in a certain way, but for the test input, I need to apply whatever pattern emerges from the training examples.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and not finding a clear pattern, perhaps I should look for a different approach.\n\nAnother observation: In Examples0, 4, and others where the output is diagonal, the input has rows that are arranged in increasing order of their maximum values. For Example0, the rows have max 2, then 3, then 3. But that's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, the output is diagonal when the rows are arranged in the order of their creation, and non-diagonal when reordered.\n\nBut how to determine when they're reordered.\n\nAnother possible pattern: The output's 5s are arranged such that each 5 in row i and column j indicates that the j-th input row is moved to the i-th position after sorting.\n\nSo the output is the transpose of the permutation matrix corresponding to the sorting.\n\nFor example, in Example1:\n\nInput rows are sorted into Row2, Row1, Row0. The permutation matrix for this sorting would have 1s at positions (0,2), (1,1), (2,0). The output is this matrix multiplied by 5.\n\nWhich matches Example1's output: [0,0,5], [0,5,0], [5,0,0]. So yes, that's the case.\n\nSo the pattern is:\n\n- Sort the input rows in descending lex order (using stable sort for ties).\n\n- For each row in the sorted list, note its original index.\n\n- The output is a permutation matrix where each row i has a 5 in column j, where j is the original index of the row that is now in position i after sorting.\n\n- If all rows are identical, the output's first row has all 5s, others zero.\n\nLet's verify this with examples.\n\nExample0:\n\nInput rows:\n\nRow0: [2,2,2]\n\nRow1: [3,2,3]\n\nRow2: [3,3,3]\n\nSorted in descending lex order: Row2, Row1, Row0.\n\nOriginal indices: 2,1,0.\n\nSo output permutation matrix:\n\nRow0 (sorted first) \u2192 original index2 \u2192 column2:5.\n\nRow1 (sorted second) \u2192 original index1 \u2192 column1:5.\n\nRow2 (sorted third) \u2192 original index0 \u2192 column0:5.\n\nSo output is:\n\n[0,0,5]\n\n[0,5,0]\n\n[5,0,0]\n\nBut the actual output for Example0 is diagonal 5s:\n\n[5,0,0]\n\n[0,5,0]\n\n[0,0,5]\n\nThis contradicts. So my hypothesis is incorrect.\n\nWait, but according to this pattern, the output would be the inverse of what is observed. Maybe the permutation is the inverse.\n\nAnother way: The permutation matrix P is such that P[i][j] = 5 if the row at position i after sorting came from original position j.\n\nSo for Example0, after sorting, the rows are Row2, Row1, Row0. So the permutation is:\n\nsorted_row0 = original_row2 \u2192 P[0][2] =5\n\nsorted_row1 = original_row1 \u2192 P[1][1] =5\n\nsorted_row2 = original_row0 \u2192 P[2][0] =5\n\nSo the permutation matrix is:\n\n[0,0,5]\n\n[0,5,0]\n\n[5,0,0]\n\nWhich is not the same as Example0's output. But the actual output is diagonal. So this pattern does not fit.\n\nThis suggests that there's another pattern I'm missing. Let's think again.\n\nIn Example0's output, the 5s are on the diagonal, implying that each row is mapped to itself. Which would mean that the rows are sorted in the same order as the input. But the input rows are not in lex order.\n\nThis is confusing. Maybe the pattern is not based on sorting the rows, but on something else.\n\nLooking at Example4's input:\n\nRows:\n\n[4,4,4]\n\n[4,4,4]\n\n[3,3,3]\n\nThe output is diagonal. So the first two rows are the same, third is different. The output diagonal suggests that each row is considered unique in its original position. So perhaps when rows are unique, they are mapped to their own positions, but when there are duplicates, it's different.\n\nBut in Example0, the input rows are unique but output is diagonal. So maybe the output is diagonal when all rows are unique, and otherwise not.\n\nBut Example1's input rows are all unique. Output is not diagonal.\n\nHmm.\n\nAnother observation: The output's 5s are in positions where the input matrix has the same value as the corresponding diagonal element in some transformed matrix.\n\nWait, for Example0's input:\n\n[2,2,2]\n\n[3,2,3]\n\n[3,3,3]\n\nOutput diagonal 5s. The diagonal elements in the input are 2, 2, 3. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the sum of the diagonal elements in the input:2+2+3=7. Not relevant.\n\nAnother idea: The output is such that each row has a 5 in the position where the corresponding input row has the maximum value in its respective column. Let's check.\n\nExample0:\n\nRow0 of input is [2,2,2]. In column0, the max is 3 (rows1 and 2). So no. But output row0 has 5 in column0. This doesn't fit.\n\nRow1: [3,2,3]. In column1, the max is 3 (row2). So output row1 has 5 in column1. That's correct.\n\nRow2: [3,3,3]. In column2, the max is 3 (rows0,1,2). So output row2 has 5 in column2. So for columns, the output row's 5 is in the column where the input row's element is the maximum in that column. But how does this work for rows that have elements which are not maxima in their columns.\n\nFor Example0:\n\nRow0's elements are 2, which are not the max in any column. But output row0 has 5 in column0. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternative approach: Maybe the output is the identity matrix scaled by5 when the input rows are all unique and sorted in a certain way. But not sure.\n\nAt this point, I'm stuck. Let's try to look for any other possible patterns.\n\nLet me consider that each output row has a 5 in the position corresponding to the number of times that row appears in the input.\n\nFor Example0, all rows are unique. So each row is mapped to its own index. So output diagonal.\n\nExample1's input has all unique rows. But output is reversed. So this doesn't fit.\n\nExample4's input has two identical rows. Output is diagonal. So this theory is invalid.\n\nAnother possibility: Each 5 in the output represents the number of times a particular value appears in the input. But not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the output matrix is the result of some matrix multiplication or transformation. For example, the input matrix multiplied by some matrix gives the output. But this is unlikely given the examples.\n\nAnother thought: The output seems to have 5s where the input's rows are the same as the corresponding column's values. For example, in Example0, the first output row has 5 in column0. The input's first row is all 2s. But column0 of the input is [2,3,3]. The max is 3. So not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is a diagonal matrix when the input is a lower or upper triangular matrix, but in Example0, the input is not triangular.\n\nThis is really challenging. Given the time I've spent and not finding a clear pattern, perhaps I should try to look for the pattern in the test input.\n\nTest Input:\n\n[4,4,4]\n\n[2,3,2]\n\n[3,2,3]\n\nAccording to the examples, the output should be a permutation matrix where each row has one 5. \n\nLooking at the input rows:\n\nRow0: [4,4,4]\n\nRow1: [2,3,2]\n\nRow2: [3,2,3]\n\nIf sorted in descending lex order:\n\nRow0: [4,4,4]\n\nRow2: [3,2,3]\n\nRow1: [2,3,2]\n\nSo sorted order is Row0, Row2, Row1. Original indices are0,2,1.\n\nSo the output permutation matrix would have:\n\nRow0 (sorted0) \u2192 original0 \u21925 in column0.\n\nRow1 (sorted1) \u2192 original2 \u21925 in column2.\n\nRow2 (sorted2) \u2192 original1 \u21925 in column1.\n\nSo the output would be:\n\n[5,0,0]\n\n[0,0,5]\n\n[0,5,0]\n\nBut looking at the training examples, Example1's output has 5s in reverse order. Maybe this is the case here.\n\nAlternatively, the rows are sorted in reverse order, but I'm not certain.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rows are sorted based on the reverse of each row. Let's compare:\n\nRow0: [4,4,4] \u2192 reversed is [4,4,4].\n\nRow1: [2,3,2] \u2192 reversed [2,3,2].\n\nRow2: [3,2,3] \u2192 reversed [3,2,3].\n\nSorted in descending order based on reversed rows:\n\nRow0's reversed row is same as original.\n\nRow2's reversed row is [3,2,3].\n\nRow1's reversed row is [2,3,2].\n\nComparing Row0 and Row2: Row0's reversed row is [4,4,4] which is higher than Row2's [3,2,3]. Then Row1's reversed row is lower. So sorted order is Row0, Row2, Row1.\n\nSo output permutation matrix would have:\n\nRow0 (original0) \u21925 in column0.\n\nRow1 (original2) \u21925 in column2.\n\nRow2 (original1) \u21925 in column1.\n\nSo output is:\n\n[5,0,0]\n\n[0,0,5]\n\n[0,5,0]\n\nBut looking at the training examples, Example1's output has 5s in reverse order. So perhaps this is the case. Let's check if this pattern aligns with the training examples.\n\nExample1's input sorted by reversed rows in descending order:\n\nRow0: [3,3,3] \u2192 reversed [3,3,3].\n\nRow1: [4,2,2] \u2192 reversed [2,2,4].\n\nRow2: [4,4,2] \u2192 reversed [2,4,4].\n\nComparing reversed rows:\n\nRow0's reversed [3,3,3].\n\nRow2's reversed [2,4,4].\n\nRow1's reversed [2,2,4].\n\nDescending order would be Row0, Row2, Row1. So output permutation would be columns0,2,1. But Example1's output is [0,0,5], [0,5,0], [5,0,0]. Which corresponds to columns2,1,0. This doesn't fit.\n\nSo this approach is also incorrect.\n\nAt this point, I'm stuck. Given the time I've spent, perhaps I should make an educated guess based on the test input.\n\nThe test input is:\n\nRow0: [4,4,4]\n\nRow1: [2,3,2]\n\nRow2: [3,2,3]\n\nLooking at the training examples, when there's a row with all elements the same (Row0), and other rows that are different, the output tends to have 5s in a diagonal pattern. For example, Example4's input has two rows of [4,4,4] and one [3,3,3], and the output is diagonal. Similarly, Example0's input has varying rows and the output is diagonal.\n\nBut in the test input, Row0 is [4,4,4], which is unique. Rows1 and2 are different.\n\nLooking at Example4's input:\n\n[4,4,4]\n\n[4,4,4]\n\n[3,3,3]\n\nOutput:\n\n[5,0,0]\n\n[0,5,0]\n\n[0,0,5]\n\nSo diagonal 5s. Even though the first two rows are the same, the output is diagonal. This suggests that when there are multiple identical rows, they are treated as unique in their original positions.\n\nIn the test input, Row0 is unique. Rows1 and2 are also unique. So perhaps the output is diagonal.\n\nBut in Example1's input, all rows are unique, but the output is not diagonal. So this theory is incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is diagonal when all rows are unique or when there's a mix but in the test case, it's diagonal. But this is not clear.\n\nAlternatively, the test input's rows are [4,4,4], [2,3,2], [3,2,3]. Let's compare with Example4, where the output is diagonal. The difference is that in Example4, two rows are the same. In the test case, all are unique. So maybe the output is diagonal.\n\nBut Example0 has all rows unique and output is diagonal. Example1 has all rows unique and output is not. So this is contradictory.\n\nGiven the confusion, perhaps the pattern is that the output is a diagonal matrix with 5s when the input rows are arranged in a certain way. But without a clear pattern, it's difficult.\n\nAlternatively, considering that in Examples0 and4, the output is diagonal when the first row is the maximum row in some way. But in Example4, the first two rows are same, so they are considered maxima.\n\nAlternatively, the first row of the input that has the maximum sum gets a 5 in the first column, and so on.\n\nBut in Example0, Row2 has the highest sum but output's first row has 5 in column0.\n\nThis is not helpful.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and the need to provide an answer, I'll make an educated guess based on Example4 and the test input.\n\nIn Example4, the input has two rows of [4,4,4] and one of [3,3,3]. The output is diagonal. This could be because the rows with higher values come first. The test input's Row0 is [4,4,4], which is the highest. Rows1 and 2 have lower sums. So the output could be diagonal.\n\nThus, the test input's output would be:\n\n[5,0,0]\n\n[0,5,0]\n\n[0,0,5]\n\nBut I'm not confident. However, looking at Example1's input, which also has a row of [3,3,3], but the output is not diagonal. So this theory is incorrect.\n\nAnother possible solution for the test input:\n\nLooking at the rows of the test input:\n\nRow0: [4,4,4]\n\nRow1: [2,3,2]\n\nRow2: [3,2,3]\n\nIf sorted in descending lex order:\n\nRow0: [4,4,4]\n\nRow2: [3,2,3]\n\nRow1: [2,3,2]\n\nOriginal indices:0,2,1.\n\nSo the output permutation matrix would have 5s in columns0,2,1.\n\nSo output:\n\nRow0: [5,0,0]\n\nRow1: [0,0,5]\n\nRow2: [0,5,0]\n\nBut this doesn't match any of the training examples' patterns. However, looking at Example1, which has a similar structure, the output is reversed.\n\nIn Example1's sorted order (descending lex), the output permutation matrix is columns2,1,0. Which results in the 5s in reverse order.\n\nSo for the test input, if the sorted order is Row0, Row2, Row1, then the output permutation matrix would be columns0,2,1. Which would lead to the output:\n\n[5,0,0]\n\n[0,0,5]\n\n[0,5,0]\n\nBut none of the training examples show such a pattern. However, looking at Example4's output, which is diagonal, it's possible that when the first row is the highest, followed by others, the output is diagonal.\n\nGiven the confusion, I'll proceed with this guess.",

        "cot_2": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. So, looking at the training examples, each input is a 3x3 grid of numbers, and the output is another 3x3 grid where most entries are 0, but some are 5. The positions of the 5s seem to vary based on the input. \n\nLet me start by looking at Example 0. The input is:\n\n[2,2,2]\n[3,2,3]\n[3,3,3]\n\nThe output is:\n\n[5,0,0]\n[0,5,0]\n[0,0,5]\n\nHmm. So the output has 5s on the diagonal. Each row in the output has a 5 in a different column. The first row's 5 is in column 0, the second in column 1, third in column 2. But how does that relate to the input?\n\nLooking at the input rows. The first row is all 2s. The second row has 3,2,3. The third row is all 3s. Maybe comparing each row to the others? Or maybe looking for the row that's different. Wait, the first input row is all 2s, the third all 3s. The second row has a 2 in the middle. So maybe the 5s indicate which row is the unique one in some way.\n\nBut in the output of example 0, each diagonal element is 5. So row 0 has 5 in column 0, row 1 in column 1, row 2 in column 2. But how does that connect to the input rows?\n\nAlternatively, maybe each output row corresponds to the sum or some operation between rows. Let's think differently. What if each output row is a 5 in the position where the input row has the maximum value in that column compared to the other rows?\n\nWait, let's check example 0. Let's look at each column in the input and see where the maximum is.\n\nFirst column of input:\nRow0:2, row1:3, row2:3. The maximum is 3 (rows 1 and 2). But the output's first column has 5 in row0. That doesn't align.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 5s are where the row has the maximum value in its own position. Like for each row, check which element is the maximum. For example, in example 0's input:\n\nFirst row: [2,2,2], all elements are 2. So the maximum is in any position. But the output's first row is [5,0,0]. Maybe if a row's elements are all the same, then the 5 is placed in a certain position. Wait, in example 0, the first and third rows have all elements the same. The output for those rows is [5,0,0] and [0,0,5], which are the first and last positions. The second row's output is [0,5,0]. The second row in the input is [3,2,3], so the middle element is 2, which is lower. Wait, maybe the 5s are placed where the element in the row is unique? Let's see.\n\nIn example 0's second input row [3,2,3], the 2 is the unique element. So the output for that row is 5 in the middle. That's [0,5,0]. For the first row [2,2,2], all elements are same, so maybe the 5 is in the first position. Third row [3,3,3], all same, 5 in last position. So the pattern here is: for a row, if all elements are the same, the 5 is placed in the first position if it's the first such row, then next in the last position? Or maybe depends on the row's position. For example, first row (all same) \u2192 5 in first column, third row (all same) \u2192 5 in third column. The middle row's unique element is in the middle. So perhaps for rows where there's a unique minimum or maximum, the 5 is placed in that position. Wait, in example 0's second row, the unique element is 2, which is the minimum. So the output 5 is at that position. So the rule could be: for each row, find the position of the unique element (if there is one), and put a 5 there. If all elements are the same, then the position depends on the row index. Like first row all same \u2192 first column, third row all same \u2192 third column, etc.\n\nLet's check example 1. Input:\n\n[3,3,3]\n[4,2,2]\n[4,4,2]\n\nOutput:\n\n[0,0,5]\n[0,5,0]\n[5,0,0]\n\nFirst row is all 3s. Output is [0,0,5], which is the third column. Second row [4,2,2], the unique element is 4 (first position). Output is [0,5,0]? Wait no, the output's second row is [0,5,0]. Wait that doesn't match. Wait the second row of input is [4,2,2]. The unique element is 4 (appears once), and the other elements are 2. So the unique element is at position 0. But the output for that row is [0,5,0]. Hmm, this contradicts the previous idea. Unless maybe the unique element is the minimum? Let's see: in row 2 of example 1 input: [4,2,2]. The unique is 4, which is higher than others. The output is [0,5,0]. So maybe the 5 is placed at the position of the minimum element in the row. In this row, the minimum is 2, which is at positions 1 and 2. But the output is [0,5,0], which is position 1. Wait, but there are two 2s here. So the unique element isn't the minimum. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 5 is placed in the position where the element is the same as the element in the same position in the next row. Not sure.\n\nLooking at example 2's input: all rows are [4,4,4]. The output is [5,5,5], then all zeros. Wait, but how? So in example 2 and 3, where all rows are the same, the output's first row is [5,5,5] and the rest are zeros. But example 3's input is all 3s, output first row [5,5,5], others zero. So perhaps when all rows are the same, the first row in the output is all 5s and others zero. But example 0 and 4's outputs have multiple 5s in different rows. Hmm.\n\nWait, example 4's input:\n\n[4,4,4]\n[4,4,4]\n[3,3,3]\n\nOutput:\n\n[5,0,0]\n[0,5,0]\n[0,0,5]\n\nSo the first two rows are all 4s, third row all 3s. The output has 5s in the diagonal. So maybe the 5s are placed in positions where the row has a unique value compared to other rows. For example, in example 4, the third row is all 3s, which is different from the first two. So the output's third row has 5 in position 2 (the diagonal). The first two rows are same as each other but different from the third. How does their output get 5s in their first and second positions? Wait, in example 4's output, first row [5,0,0], second [0,5,0], third [0,0,5]. So each row's 5 is at their own index. Maybe when a row is part of a group of identical rows, but there's another group, then each row in a group gets a 5 in their row index's column. Like, in example 4, first two rows are same, so first row's 5 is in column 0, second in column 1. The third row is different, so 5 in column 2.\n\nWait, let's think again. For each row, if the row is part of a group (i.e., there are other rows identical to it), then the 5 is placed in the column corresponding to their row index. If the row is unique (no other rows are identical), then the 5 is placed in the column where the unique element is. Wait, but in example 1:\n\nInput rows:\n\n[3,3,3] (row0)\n[4,2,2] (row1)\n[4,4,2] (row2)\n\nRow0 is unique. Row1 and row2 are different from each other. So for row0, since it's unique, where to put the 5? In example 1's output, row0 has 5 in column 2. Why? Because the row is all 3s. If all elements are same and the row is unique, perhaps the 5 is placed in the column corresponding to the row's index. Wait row0 is index 0, but the output is [0,0,5]. That's column 2. Hmm, that doesn't fit. So maybe that's not the pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 5s are arranged such that each column in the output has exactly one 5, and the rest zeros, like a permutation matrix. But in example 2 and 3, the output's first row is all 5s, which breaks that idea. But in example 0, 1, 4, each row has exactly one 5. However, example 2 and 3's outputs have a row with all 5s. So maybe when all rows are the same, the first row in output is all 5s, and the rest zeros. Otherwise, each output row has a single 5 in a certain position.\n\nSo let's split into two cases:\n\nCase 1: All input rows are identical. Then output's first row is all 5s, others zeros. Examples 2 and 3.\n\nCase 2: Not all rows identical. Then each output row has exactly one 5, forming a diagonal-like pattern but depending on some rule.\n\nLooking at example 0:\n\nNot all rows identical. Output has 5s on the diagonal. But why?\n\nExample0's input:\n\nRow0: [2,2,2]\n\nRow1: [3,2,3]\n\nRow2: [3,3,3]\n\nSo row0 and row2 are all same elements. Row1 is different. So output has 5s in diagonal. Row0's 5 in column0, row1 in column1, row2 in column2. So perhaps when there's a mix of same and different rows, the 5s are placed in the diagonal. But why?\n\nAlternatively, maybe each row in the output has a 5 in the column corresponding to the number of times that row's elements are present in the input. Wait, not sure.\n\nWait, looking at example4's input:\n\n[4,4,4] (row0)\n[4,4,4] (row1)\n[3,3,3] (row2)\n\nRow0 and row1 are same. Row2 is different. The output has diagonal 5s. So each row's 5 is in the column equal to their index. So row0 (same as row1) \u2192 5 in column0, row1 \u2192 column1, row2 \u2192 column2. But why?\n\nMaybe the rule is: for each row, if there are multiple identical rows, assign 5 to the column equal to their original row index, and for rows that are unique (like row2 in example4), assign 5 to their row index column. But in example1:\n\nRow0 is unique. So output row0 has 5 in column2. But why? Row0's index is 0. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 5s are arranged such that each column has exactly one 5, and the order depends on the input rows. For example, in example0, the 5s are in the diagonal. Example1's output is [0,0,5], [0,5,0], [5,0,0], which is a reverse diagonal. Example4's output is diagonal. So maybe the 5s form a permutation matrix where the permutation depends on the input rows' uniqueness.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is a diagonal matrix when each row is distinct, but when there are duplicate rows, the 5s are placed in the earliest columns. Not sure.\n\nLet me think of another approach. Let's compare the input and output for each example, looking for what changes.\n\nTake example0:\n\nInput rows:\n\n[2,2,2]\n\n[3,2,3]\n\n[3,3,3]\n\nOutput rows:\n\n[5,0,0]\n\n[0,5,0]\n\n[0,0,5]\n\nEach output row's 5 is in a different column. Now, looking at the input rows, perhaps the 5's column in each output row corresponds to the position of the minimum value in the input row. Let's check:\n\nRow0: all 2s. Min is 2, so any position. But the 5 is in column0.\n\nRow1: elements [3,2,3]. Min is 2 at position1. The output's 5 is in position1.\n\nRow2: all 3s. Min is 3. The 5 is in position2.\n\nHmm, but in example1:\n\nRow0 input: [3,3,3], min 3. Output's 5 is in column2.\n\nRow1: [4,2,2], min 2 at positions1 and2. Output's 5 is in column1.\n\nRow2: [4,4,2], min 2 at position2. Output's 5 is in position0.\n\nSo this doesn't fit. So the minimum position isn't directly determining the 5's column.\n\nAnother idea: For each row, if the elements are all the same, then the 5 is placed in the column corresponding to the row index. But example0's first row is all 2s, row index0 \u2192 output column0. Third row all 3s, row index2 \u2192 output column2. That fits. The second row has min in position1, output column1. Example4's first two rows are same, so for row0, column0; row1, column1. Third row same, column2. So that fits. \n\nIn example1's first row is all 3s (row0), but output is [0,0,5], which is column2. So this breaks that idea. Unless maybe when all rows are the same, but there's a unique row, the pattern changes. Wait, example1's row0 is all 3s, but rows1 and 2 are different. So perhaps for rows with all elements same, their 5 is placed in a different column. How?\n\nWait, in example1's row0 (all 3s) output is [0,0,5], which is column2. Maybe when a row is all same but there are other rows that are not all same, the 5 is placed in the column corresponding to the sum of the elements modulo 3? 3+3+3=9 mod3 is 0. So column0. But output is column2. Hmm, not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe for rows that are all same, the 5 is placed in the column equal to the number of elements minus one. For example, 3 elements, so column2. But in example0, the first row (all same) has 5 in column0, which is 0. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternative approach: Let's look for how many times each row appears in the input.\n\nExample0:\n\nRow0: [2,2,2] appears once.\n\nRow1: [3,2,3] appears once.\n\nRow2: [3,3,3] appears once.\n\nAll rows are unique. Output is diagonal 5s.\n\nExample1:\n\nRow0: [3,3,3] once.\n\nRow1: [4,2,2] once.\n\nRow2: [4,4,2] once.\n\nAll unique. Output is reverse diagonal: 5s at (0,2), (1,1), (2,0).\n\nExample4:\n\nRow0 and row1 are same. Row2 is unique. Output is diagonal.\n\nSo when there are duplicate rows, the output's 5s for those rows are placed in their row index columns. When rows are unique, perhaps the 5s are placed in some other pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output's 5s are arranged in a diagonal if all rows are unique or if there's a mix, but in example1, all rows are unique and the 5s are reverse diagonal.\n\nHmm. Maybe there's a priority based on the row values. For example, the rows are sorted in some way, and the 5s are placed in the diagonal after sorting.\n\nExample0's input rows are sorted as row0: [2,2,2], row1: [3,2,3], row2: [3,3,3]. Output is diagonal. If we sort the rows in ascending order (assuming numerical order), then the output's diagonal corresponds to the original positions. But example1's rows would be sorted, but the output is reverse diagonal. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the output's 5s form a diagonal if the rows are in increasing order. Example0's rows are in increasing order (all 2s, then 3,2,3, then all 3s). But I'm not sure. Example1's rows: [3,3,3], [4,2,2], [4,4,2]. Not in obvious order.\n\nAnother angle: The output 5s are arranged such that each column has exactly one 5, forming a permutation. The permutation depends on the order of rows sorted in some way.\n\nFor example0, the permutation is identity (diagonal). For example1, the permutation is reverse order (columns 2,1,0). For example4, the permutation is identity. For examples2 and3, the first row is all 5s, which isn't a permutation. But maybe when all rows are same, the first row is all 5s.\n\nWait, but examples2 and3 are the case when all rows are same. So the output is [5,5,5] in the first row and zeros otherwise. So perhaps that's a special case.\n\nSo the pattern might be:\n\n- If all rows in the input are identical, the output's first row is [5,5,5], and the rest are zeros.\n\n- Otherwise, each output row has a single 5. The position of the 5 in each row depends on the input rows' arrangement. For example, if the rows are sorted in a certain way, the 5s form a diagonal or reverse diagonal.\n\nBut how to determine the permutation for when rows are unique or a mix.\n\nLooking at example1:\n\nInput rows:\n\n[3,3,3]\n\n[4,2,2]\n\n[4,4,2]\n\nOutput:\n\n[0,0,5]\n\n[0,5,0]\n\n[5,0,0]\n\nSo the 5s are at (0,2), (1,1), (2,0). This is a reverse diagonal. So the permutation is the reverse order. How does that relate to the input rows? If we sort the rows in descending order, maybe the permutation is reversed.\n\nLet's try sorting the input rows of example1 in descending order. The rows are:\n\n[3,3,3] (row0)\n\n[4,2,2] (row1)\n\n[4,4,2] (row2)\n\nSorting them in descending order (comparing lex order). The lex order of the rows:\n\nRow2: [4,4,2] is highest.\n\nRow1: [4,2,2] next.\n\nRow0: [3,3,3] lowest.\n\nSo sorted order is row2, row1, row0. Then, the output's permutation would be 2,1,0. But the output's 5s are in columns 2,1,0. So if the sorted order is row2, row1, row0, then the 5s are placed in the columns corresponding to their original indices. For example, original row0 becomes third in sorted order, so its 5 is in column0 (original index). Wait, maybe not. Alternatively, after sorting, assign the 5s to the diagonal of the sorted matrix, but then map back to the original positions. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rows are sorted in reverse order, and then the 5s are placed in the diagonal. In example1, sorting the rows in reverse lex order (highest first), then the 5s are placed in reverse diagonal.\n\nBut this is getting complicated. Let's think of another approach.\n\nLooking at example4:\n\nInput:\n\n[4,4,4]\n\n[4,4,4]\n\n[3,3,3]\n\nOutput:\n\n[5,0,0]\n\n[0,5,0]\n\n[0,0,5]\n\nHere, the first two rows are the same. The output's 5s are in the diagonal. So for the duplicate rows, each has 5 in their own row's index column. The third row is unique and has 5 in column2.\n\nExample0's rows: first and third are unique (but row0 and row2 are not duplicates of each other). So output is diagonal.\n\nSo maybe when there are multiple groups of rows (like duplicates and unique), each group's rows have their 5s in their own row indices. For example, in example4, the first two rows form a group (duplicates), each gets their own row index column. The third row is unique and gets its own index column.\n\nIn example1, all rows are unique, so each row's 5 is in their own index column. Wait no, because in example1's output, the first row's 5 is in column2. So that contradicts.\n\nWait example1's output:\n\nRow0: [0,0,5]\n\nRow1: [0,5,0]\n\nRow2: [5,0,0]\n\nSo the 5s are in columns 2,1,0. Which is reverse of row indices. So it's reverse diagonal. Why?\n\nMaybe the pattern is that when all rows are unique, the 5s are placed in reverse diagonal order, sorted by some criteria. For example, if rows are sorted in descending order, their original indices are reversed.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 5s are placed in the columns determined by the row's position after sorting. For example, in example1, if we sort the rows in a certain way, their new order determines the column of 5.\n\nLet me try sorting the input rows of example1 in lexicographical descending order.\n\nOriginal rows:\n\nRow0: [3,3,3]\n\nRow1: [4,2,2]\n\nRow2: [4,4,2]\n\nLexicographical order (descending):\n\nRow2: [4,4,2]\n\nRow1: [4,2,2]\n\nRow0: [3,3,3]\n\nSo sorted order is row2, row1, row0.\n\nNow, the output for example1 is:\n\nRow0 (original) \u2192 output column2\n\nRow1 \u2192 column1\n\nRow2 \u2192 column0\n\nWhich corresponds to the original rows' positions in the sorted list. So sorted list is row2 (original), row1 (original), row0 (original). The output columns are the indices of their position in the sorted list. For example:\n\nOriginal row0 is third in the sorted list (index2), so its 5 is in column2.\n\nOriginal row1 is second in sorted list (index1), so 5 in column1.\n\nOriginal row2 is first in sorted list (index0), so 5 in column0.\n\nSo the output's columns are the sorted indices. That seems to fit.\n\nLet me check this with other examples.\n\nExample0:\n\nInput rows:\n\nRow0: [2,2,2]\n\nRow1: [3,2,3]\n\nRow2: [3,3,3]\n\nSorting lex descending:\n\nRow2: [3,3,3]\n\nRow1: [3,2,3]\n\nRow0: [2,2,2]\n\nSorted order: row2, row1, row0.\n\nThus, original row0 is third (index2) \u2192 output column2.\n\nBut in example0's output, row0's 5 is in column0. So this doesn't fit. Hmm.\n\nWait example0's output is:\n\n[5,0,0] \u2192 row0, column0\n\n[0,5,0] \u2192 row1, column1\n\n[0,0,5] \u2192 row2, column2\n\nWhich is the diagonal. So according to the previous idea, sorted indices would not align. So this contradicts.\n\nBut in example0, the input rows are:\n\n[2,2,2], [3,2,3], [3,3,3]\n\nLex descending order:\n\nRow2: [3,3,3]\n\nRow1: [3,2,3]\n\nRow0: [2,2,2]\n\nSo sorted order is row2, row1, row0. Then the output columns should be 2,1,0 for the original rows. But in example0's output, they are 0,1,2. So that doesn't fit.\n\nSo maybe the pattern isn't based on sorting the rows. Let's think differently.\n\nAnother observation: In all examples except when all rows are the same, the output has exactly three 5s, one in each column and row (i.e., permutation matrix). When all rows are same, the first output row is all 5s.\n\nSo the key is to find the permutation for the 5s when not all rows are same.\n\nLooking at example1's output permutation is [2,1,0], which is the reverse order. Example0's is [0,1,2], which is identity. Example4's is [0,1,2], identity.\n\nSo why the difference between example0 and example1?\n\nExample0's input rows have two rows with all same elements (row0 and row2), but example1's all rows are unique.\n\nWait, no. example0's input rows are:\n\nRow0: all 2s.\n\nRow1: [3,2,3]\n\nRow2: all 3s.\n\nSo row0 and row2 are unique. Row1 is unique. So all rows are unique. But example0's output is identity permutation. Example1's output is reverse permutation.\n\nSo why when all rows are unique, sometimes the permutation is identity and sometimes reverse?\n\nAlternative approach: Let's look for the positions of the maximum elements in each column.\n\nIn example0's input:\n\nColumn0: 2,3,3 \u2192 max is 3 (rows1 and2)\n\nColumn1: 2,2,3 \u2192 max is 3 (row2)\n\nColumn2: 2,3,3 \u2192 max is3 (rows1 and2)\n\nBut output 5s are in diagonal. Not sure.\n\nAnother idea: Each output row's 5 is in the position of the element that is unique in its column.\n\nFor example0:\n\nLooking for elements that are unique in their column.\n\nColumn0:\n\nRow0:2, row1:3, row2:3. Only row0 has 2. So unique in column0. So maybe row0's 5 is in column0.\n\nColumn1:\n\nAll rows except row1 have 2 or 3. Row1's column1 is 2, which is unique in that column (others are 2 or 3). Wait, no: column1 has 2 (row0), 2 (row1), 3 (row2). So row1's 2 is not unique. So not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 5's position in each row is determined by the position of the element that is the same as in the next row. Or some other relation between consecutive rows.\n\nIn example0:\n\nRow0: [2,2,2]\n\nRow1: [3,2,3]\n\nRow2: [3,3,3]\n\nLooking at row0 and row1, the middle element is 2 in both. So perhaps the 5 in row0's first column, but output is [5,0,0]. Not sure.\n\nAnother approach: Let's consider that the sum of each output row is 5. So each output row is 5 in one position, 0 elsewhere. Except when all rows are same, then the first row is all 5s.\n\nThe key is to find the position of the 5 in each row. For the examples where not all rows are same, the 5s form a permutation. The challenge is to find the permutation.\n\nIn example0, permutation is identity.\n\nIn example1, permutation is reverse.\n\nIn example4, permutation is identity.\n\nHmm. So what's different between example0 and example1.\n\nExample0:\n\nRow0: [2,2,2]\n\nRow1: [3,2,3]\n\nRow2: [3,3,3]\n\nExample1:\n\nRow0: [3,3,3]\n\nRow1: [4,2,2]\n\nRow2: [4,4,2]\n\nExample4:\n\nRow0 and row1: [4,4,4]\n\nRow2: [3,3,3]\n\nSo in example4, the first two rows are same. So when there's a group of duplicate rows, each in their own row index's column. When rows are unique, perhaps sorted in reverse order.\n\nWait, example1's output is reverse permutation. Maybe the permutation depends on the sorted order of the rows. If rows are sorted in ascending order, the permutation is the original indices. If sorted in descending order, it's reverse.\n\nBut how to determine which order.\n\nAlternatively, the permutation is determined by the order of rows sorted in lex order. For example:\n\nIn example0:\n\nOriginal rows:\n\n[2,2,2], [3,2,3], [3,3,3]\n\nLex order is row0, row1, row2. So sorted order is row0, row1, row2. So output is identity permutation.\n\nExample1's rows:\n\n[3,3,3], [4,2,2], [4,4,2]\n\nLex order: row0 ([3,3,3]), row1 ([4,2,2]), row2 ([4,4,2]). Wait no, lex order for rows would compare the first element. row0 starts with 3, others start with 4, so row0 is lex smallest. Then between row1 and row2: row1 is [4,2,2], row2 is [4,4,2]. Compare second element: 2 vs 4. So row1 is lex smaller than row2. So sorted order is row0, row1, row2. So output permutation should be identity. But example1's output is reverse permutation. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the permutation is determined by the reverse lex order. For example, sorted in descending lex order, then assign 5s in reverse order.\n\nExample1's sorted in descending lex order would be row2, row1, row0. So the permutation is 2,1,0. Which matches example1's output's columns (5s in columns 2,1,0).\n\nExample0's sorted descending:\n\nrow2 ([3,3,3]), row1 ([3,2,3]), row0 ([2,2,2]). So permutation would be 2,1,0. But example0's output is identity permutation. So this contradicts.\n\nHmm. So this theory holds for example1 but not example0. Not sure.\n\nAlternative idea: For each row, the 5's column is determined by the number of elements in that row that are equal to the corresponding elements in the previous row. Or something like that. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, think of the rows as nodes and the permutation as a way to cycle through them. But I'm not seeing it.\n\nAlternatively, the permutation is determined by the row's uniqueness and the order they appear. For example, in example1, since all rows are unique, the output permutation is reverse order of their appearance. So row0, row1, row2 in input become columns 2,1,0. Example0 has rows where two are unique and one is unique, but output is identity. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAnother approach: Maybe the 5s in the output are placed in the columns corresponding to the number of times the value appears in the entire input grid.\n\nBut example0's input has more 2s and 3s, but output columns are 0,1,2. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 5's column for a row is the index of the maximum element in that row. Let's check:\n\nExample0:\n\nRow0: all 2s. Max is 2. So any column. Output column0.\n\nRow1: [3,2,3]. Max is3 in columns0 and2. Output column1. Doesn't fit.\n\nSo no.\n\nAlternatively, the column is the index of the minimum element in the row.\n\nExample0 row1's min is 2 at index1. Output column1. Fits.\n\nRow0's min is 2, but output column0. So for rows where all elements are same, the column is the row's index.\n\nRow2's min is3, output column2.\n\nExample1:\n\nRow0: all 3s. column2.\n\nRow1: min 2 at indices1 and2. output column1.\n\nRow2: min 2 at index2. output column0.\n\nDoesn't fit.\n\nSo maybe for rows with all elements same, the 5 is placed at the row index. For rows with a unique minimum, the 5 is at the min's index. For rows with multiple minima, the 5 is placed at the row index.\n\nBut in example1's row2, [4,4,2], the min is at index2. But output's 5 is at column0. So that doesn't fit.\n\nThis is getting really confusing. Let me look for another pattern.\n\nLooking at example4's output, the first two rows are same in the input. Their output has 5s in their own row's index columns. The third row is unique and has 5 in its row's index column. So perhaps the rule is:\n\nFor each row, if it's the first occurrence of its value sequence, place the 5 in the row's index column. If there are duplicates, each subsequent duplicate also gets their own row index column.\n\nWait, example4's first two rows are same. Both are [4,4,4]. So the first occurrence is row0, so row0's output is column0. row1 is a duplicate, so its output is column1. Third row is unique, column2. That fits.\n\nExample0's input has three unique rows. So each gets their own column. Output is diagonal.\n\nExample1's input has three unique rows, but output's columns are 2,1,0. So perhaps the first occurrence is determined by a different order.\n\nWait, in example1's input:\n\nRow0: [3,3,3]\n\nRow1: [4,2,2]\n\nRow2: [4,4,2]\n\nThe first occurrence of each unique row is row0, row1, row2. So each would get their own column. But output is [0,0,5], [0,5,0], [5,0,0]. Which is columns 2,1,0. So the columns are in reverse order of their first occurrence.\n\nSo maybe the permutation is determined by the reverse order of the first occurrence of each unique row.\n\nIn example1, the unique rows are row0, row1, row2. Reverse order is row2, row1, row0. So their columns are 0,1,2 for their original rows. But output columns are 2,1,0. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, the permutation is determined by the order of unique rows sorted in reverse lex order.\n\nFor example, in example1, the unique rows are sorted in reverse lex order:\n\nrow2: [4,4,2]\n\nrow1: [4,2,2]\n\nrow0: [3,3,3]\n\nSo the order is row2, row1, row0. Then, assign columns 0,1,2 to these sorted unique rows. So row2 (original) gets column0, row1 gets column1, row0 gets column2. This matches example1's output.\n\nIn example0, the unique rows are sorted in reverse lex order:\n\nrow2: [3,3,3]\n\nrow1: [3,2,3]\n\nrow0: [2,2,2]\n\nSorted order is row2, row1, row0. Assign columns 0,1,2. So output for row0 (original) would be column2, row1 column1, row2 column0. But example0's output is diagonal, which doesn't match. So this theory doesn't hold.\n\nThis is really challenging. Let's try to find another approach.\n\nPerhaps the output is determined by the position of the row's \"identifier\" when all rows are sorted in some way. For instance, if we sort the rows and then assign the 5s based on their original positions.\n\nIn example1:\n\nRows sorted in reverse lex order: row2, row1, row0.\n\nThe output's 5s are in columns 2,1,0. So for the sorted rows, the first row (row2) has 5 in column0 of the output, but in the original output, row2 has 5 in column0. So how does that fit?\n\nAlternatively, when rows are sorted, their original indices are mapped to the columns in the output. For example, after sorting, the first row in sorted order (row2) gets column0 in the output. But the original row2's output is [5,0,0], which is column0. The second sorted row is row1, which gets column1. Original row1's output is [0,5,0]. The third sorted row is row0, which gets column2. Original row0's output is [0,0,5]. So this works for example1.\n\nExample0:\n\nSorted rows in reverse lex order: row2, row1, row0.\n\nSo row2 (original) gets column0, row1 column1, row0 column2. But example0's output is diagonal. Original row0's output is [5,0,0], which would be column0, but according to this theory, it should be column2. So this doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. So this theory works for example1 but not example0.\n\nThis suggests that the pattern is not consistent across all examples. Which is unlikely, so I must be missing something.\n\nLet me think of the outputs as permutation matrices. A permutation matrix has exactly one 1 in each row and column. Here, it's 5s instead of 1s. So the output is a permutation matrix multiplied by 5.\n\nThe key is to determine which permutation is used.\n\nIn example0, permutation is identity.\n\nIn example1, permutation is reverse order.\n\nIn example4, permutation is identity.\n\nIn examples2 and3, when all rows are same, the output is not a permutation matrix.\n\nSo the permutation depends on some property of the input rows.\n\nAnother idea: the permutation is determined by the number of times each row appears. For example, if there are two rows that are the same, they are grouped together. The permutation is such that the first occurrence of each unique row is placed in the column corresponding to their group's order.\n\nBut this is vague.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the permutation is determined by the rows' sums. For example, rows are sorted based on their sum, and the permutation is the order of these sums.\n\nExample0:\n\nRow0 sum:6\n\nRow1 sum:8\n\nRow2 sum:9\n\nSorted sums:6,8,9 \u2192 row0, row1, row2. So permutation is identity.\n\nOutput is identity.\n\nExample1:\n\nRow0 sum:9\n\nRow1 sum:8\n\nRow2 sum:10\n\nSorted sums:8 (row1),9 (row0),10 (row2). So permutation would be row1, row0, row2. But output's permutation is columns 2,1,0. Doesn't fit.\n\nExample4:\n\nRow0 and1 sum:12\n\nRow2 sum:9\n\nSo sorted sums:9 (row2),12 (row0 and1). But output is identity.\n\nNot matching.\n\nAlternatively, sorted in descending order of sums.\n\nExample0's sums:6,8,9 \u2192 sorted as row2 (9), row1 (8), row0 (6). So permutation would be 2,1,0. But output is identity. Doesn't fit.\n\nExample1's sums:9,8,10 \u2192 sorted as row2 (10), row0 (9), row1 (8). permutation would be 2,0,1. But output is columns 2,1,0. Not matching.\n\nThis is getting me stuck. Let's try to find a different angle.\n\nIn example0's output, each 5 is in the diagonal. This could be because each row is unique and the permutation is based on their original order.\n\nIn example1's output, the permutation is reverse diagonal. So why?\n\nMaybe the permutation is determined by the number of elements in the row that are higher than the elements in the same column of other rows. For example, the row that has the most elements that are higher than others in their columns gets the first column in the permutation.\n\nBut this is complex.\n\nAlternatively, consider that the output's permutation is such that each 5 in column c of row r indicates that row r is the 'winner' in column c based on some criteria. For example, in each column, the row with the highest value in that column gets a 5 in the corresponding row's output.\n\nBut let's check example0:\n\nColumn0: rows0=2, row1=3, row2=3. Highest is 3 (rows1 and2). So for column0, both row1 and row2 would have 5, but output has only one 5 per row. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAnother thought: The output is a permutation matrix where each row's 5 is in the column corresponding to the row's position when sorted in a certain way. For example, sorted by the first element in the row.\n\nExample0's rows sorted by first element:\n\n row0 (2), row1 (3), row2 (3). So order row0, row1, row2. permutation is identity.\n\nExample1's rows sorted by first element:\n\n row0 (3), row1 (4), row2 (4). So order row0, row1, row2. permutation is identity. But example1's output is reverse.\n\nSo this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, sorted by the first element in descending order.\n\nExample0's rows: row1 and row2 first element 3, row0 2. So sorted as row1, row2, row0. permutation would be 1,2,0. Output is identity. No match.\n\nThis is really challenging. Let's try to look for a pattern in the Test Input.\n\nTest Input:\n\n[4,4,4]\n\n[2,3,2]\n\n[3,2,3]\n\nWe need to apply the pattern.\n\nThe rows are:\n\nRow0: [4,4,4]\n\nRow1: [2,3,2]\n\nRow2: [3,2,3]\n\nAre all rows unique? Yes.\n\nSo according to some examples, the output would be a permutation matrix. Which permutation?\n\nLooking at example1, where all rows are unique, the permutation is reverse diagonal. Example0 has all rows unique and permutation is identity. So what's the difference between example0 and example1.\n\nExample0's rows are all same in the first and third rows (row0 and row2 are all same elements). Wait no: row0 is all 2s, row2 all 3s. So they are unique. So example0's input has three unique rows. Output is identity permutation.\n\nExample1's input has three unique rows. Output is reverse permutation.\n\nWhat's the difference between them? Maybe the order in which the rows appear.\n\nExample0's rows are in increasing order of their first element. Row0's first element is 2, row1's 3, row2's 3. But row2's first element is same as row1, but the rest of the elements are higher. So sorted in lex order: row0, row1, row2.\n\nExample1's rows are sorted in lex order: row0 (3,3,3), row1 (4,2,2), row2 (4,4,2). So sorted as row0, row1, row2.\n\nBut example1's output is reverse. So perhaps when the input rows are sorted in lex order, the permutation is reverse if the rows are not in lex order in the input.\n\nExample0's input is already in lex order, so permutation is identity. Example1's input is not in lex order (row0 is first, row1 and row2 are after), but the output is reverse. But this doesn't make sense.\n\nAlternatively, if the input rows are in lex order, permutation is identity. If not, permutation is reverse.\n\nBut example1's input is in lex order (row0's first element is 3, row1's 4, row2's 4. Between row1 and row2, row1's second element is 2, row2's is4. So row1 comes before row2. So lex order is row0, row1, row2. But the output is reverse.\n\nSo this theory doesn't hold.\n\nAt this point, I'm struggling to find the pattern. Let's try to summarize what I know:\n\n- When all rows are identical, output first row is all 5s, others zero.\n\n- Otherwise, output is a permutation matrix with exactly one 5 per row and column.\n\n- The permutation varies: identity (example0), reverse (example1), identity (example4).\n\n- For rows that are duplicates, they are placed in their row index columns (example4).\n\n- For unique rows, the permutation depends on some ordering (example0 and example1).\n\nAnother observation: In example4, the first two rows are duplicates, so their 5s are in their own row index columns. The third row is unique and is in its own row index column. So perhaps when there are duplicates, each group of duplicates is treated as a single entity, and their row indices determine the column. For unique rows, their row index determines the column.\n\nBut example0's rows are all unique, so each row's 5 is in their own row index column. Which fits the identity permutation.\n\nExample1's output is reverse permutation. So why?\n\nThe only difference is that example1's rows are not in lex order. Wait, no. example0's rows are in lex order. example1's rows are in lex order (row0 < row1 < row2). But the output is reverse.\n\nThis doesn't fit.\n\nAlternative idea: The permutation is determined by the order of the rows sorted based on their elements' sum.\n\nExample0's sums:\n\nRow0:6, row1:8, row2:9. Sorted order: row0, row1, row2 \u2192 identity permutation.\n\nExample1's sums:\n\nRow0:9, row1:8, row2:10. Sorted order: row1 (8), row0 (9), row2 (10). So permutation would be 1,0,2. But output is 2,1,0. Doesn't fit.\n\nExample4's sums:\n\nRow0 and 1:12, row2:9. Sorted order: row2, row0, row1. permutation would be 2,0,1. But output is identity.\n\nSo this doesn't work.\n\nI'm stuck. Maybe I should look for a different pattern.\n\nLooking at the test input:\n\n[4,4,4]\n\n[2,3,2]\n\n[3,2,3]\n\nWe need to find the output. Let's try to apply possible rules.\n\nIf the rule is: for each row, if it's unique, the 5 is in the row's index column. If it's part of a group, each in their own index.\n\nIn the test input, all rows are unique. So each 5 would be in their row index columns. So output would be diagonal: [5,0,0], [0,5,0], [0,0,5]. But example1's output is reverse for unique rows. So this may not be the case.\n\nAlternatively, in example1, the output is reverse permutation. Why? Because the rows are sorted in descending order. So for the test input, if sorted in descending order, the permutation is reverse.\n\nTest input's rows:\n\nRow0: [4,4,4]\n\nRow1: [2,3,2]\n\nRow2: [3,2,3]\n\nSorting in descending lex order:\n\nRow0: [4,4,4] comes first.\n\nRow2: [3,2,3] comes next.\n\nRow1: [2,3,2] comes last.\n\nSo sorted order is row0, row2, row1.\n\nThe permutation would be 0,2,1. So the output's 5s would be in columns 0,2,1. So row0's 5 in column0, row2's in column2, row1's in column1. But the test input's rows are in the original order row0, row1, row2. So the output would be:\n\n[5,0,0]\n\n[0,5,0]\n\n[0,0,5]\n\nBut example1's output for sorted order would be row2, row1, row0, so columns 0,1,2. But output is reverse. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the permutation is the inverse of the sorted order indices.\n\nThis is getting too time-consuming. Given the time I've spent, I'll make an educated guess based on example4 and example0, where duplicate rows have their 5s in their own row index columns, and unique rows also do. For the test input, all rows are unique, so output would be diagonal. But example1's unique rows output is reverse, which contradicts.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps when all rows are unique, the permutation is the reverse of the row indices. So test input's output would be reverse diagonal.\n\nBut example0's unique rows output is identity. So this is conflicting.\n\nAnother possible pattern from example1 and example4:\n\nExample4's input has two groups: two duplicates and one unique. Output is diagonal.\n\nExample1's input has three unique rows. Output is reverse diagonal.\n\nExample0's input has three unique rows. Output is diagonal.\n\nSo maybe when there are an even number of groups, output is reverse. No, example4 has two groups (one group of two, one group of one), which is even? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, when the number of unique rows is even, output is reverse. Example1 has three unique rows (odd), output is reverse. Not sure.\n\nThis is not leading me anywhere. I'll have to make a guess.\n\nLooking at the test input:\n\nRow0: [4,4,4]\n\nRow1: [2,3,2]\n\nRow2: [3,2,3]\n\nAll rows are unique. So according to example0 and example1, sometimes output is diagonal, sometimes reverse.\n\nBut why in example0 it's diagonal and example1 reverse.\n\nLooking at example0's input rows:\n\nRow0: all 2s.\n\nRow1: [3,2,3]\n\nRow2: all 3s.\n\nIn row0 and row2, all elements are same. Maybe when there are such rows, the permutation is diagonal.\n\nIn example1's input, no rows have all elements same. So permutation is reverse.\n\nTest input's row0 has all 4s. So it's a row with all elements same. So according to example0's case, the permutation would be diagonal. So test output would be diagonal.\n\nBut example1's output is reverse, but that has no such rows.\n\nSo perhaps when there's at least one row with all elements same, the permutation is diagonal. Otherwise, reverse.\n\nTest input's row0 is all 4s. So permutation is diagonal.\n\nSo output would be:\n\n[5,0,0]\n\n[0,5,0]\n\n[0,0,5]\n\nBut example4's input has two rows with all elements same and one unique. Output is diagonal.\n\nExample0's input has two rows with all elements same (row0 and row2?) No, row0 is all 2s, row2 is all 3s. So they are unique rows, but each is all same.\n\nSo perhaps if any row has all elements same, the permutation is diagonal. Otherwise, reverse.\n\nTest input has one row with all elements same. So output is diagonal.\n\nThus, the test output would be:\n\n[5,0,0]\n\n[0,5,0]\n\n[0,0,5]\n\nBut example1's input has no all-same rows, so output is reverse.\n\nYes, this seems to fit.\n\nSo the pattern is:\n\n- If all rows are identical, output first row all 5s, others zero.\n\n- If any row has all elements the same, output is a diagonal matrix (5s on the diagonal).\n\n- If no row has all elements the same, output is reverse diagonal (5s on the reverse diagonal).\n\nLet's verify this against the examples.\n\nExample0:\n\nInput has rows with all elements same (row0 and row2). Output is diagonal. Correct.\n\nExample1:\n\nNo rows with all elements same. Output reverse diagonal. Correct.\n\nExample4:\n\nRow0 and row1 are all same. Output diagonal. Correct.\n\nExample2 and 3:\n\nAll rows same. Output first row all 5s. Correct.\n\nSo this pattern holds.\n\nNow, applying this to the test input:\n\nTest input's row0 is all 4s. So there exists a row with all elements same. Thus, output is diagonal matrix.\n\nSo each row's 5 is in their own row index column.\n\nSo:\n\nRow0: [5,0,0]\n\nRow1: [0,5,0]\n\nRow2: [0,0,5]\n\nBut let's check the test input's other rows. Row1: [2,3,2]. Not all elements same. Row2: [3,2,3]. Not all elements same. But since row0 is all same, output is diagonal.\n\nYes, according to the pattern."
