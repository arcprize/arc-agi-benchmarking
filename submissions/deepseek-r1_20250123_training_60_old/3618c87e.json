        "cot_1": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. I see that the input is a 5x5 grid of numbers, and the output has some changes compared to the input. Let's look at the training examples one by one to spot the transformations.\n\nStarting with Example 0. The input has a 1 in the center of the third row (position [2][2]), and in the fourth row, there's a 5 in the same column. The fifth row is all 5s. The output shows that the 1 in the third row is gone, and the fifth row now has a 1 in the middle (position [4][2]). The 5 from the fourth row's middle is still there. So maybe the 1 is moving down, replacing a 5, and the original 1 disappears. Also, the other 5s in the fifth row are staying, except the one where the 1 was placed.\n\nIn Example 1, the third row has 1s at positions [2][1] and [2][3]. The fourth row has 5s at those same columns. The output moves those 1s down to the fifth row, replacing the corresponding 5s, but keeping the 5s in the fourth row. The fifth row's 5s at columns 1 and 3 become 1s, and the others stay. So the 1s from the third row are moving down two rows to the fifth row, same columns. And the 5s in the fourth row remain.\n\nExample 2 follows a similar pattern. The third row has 1s at columns 1 and 4. The fourth row has 5s there. The output moves those 1s down to the fifth row's columns 1 and 4, replacing the 5s. The fourth row's 5s stay. So the rule seems to be: for each 1 in the third row (row index 2), move it down two rows to the fifth row (row index 4) in the same column, replacing the 5 there. Then, set the original third row's 1s to 0. Also, the fourth row's 5s (row index 3) remain unless they are directly below the 1s in the third row. Wait, but in Example 0, the fourth row's 5 is still there after moving. Hmm.\n\nWait, let me check again. In Example 0's input, the third row has a 1 in column 2. The fourth row in the same column has a 5. In the output, the fourth row's 5 stays, and the fifth row's column 2 (originally 5) becomes 1. So yes, the 1 moves from third row to fifth row, same column. The fourth row's value isn't changed. So the steps are: for each 1 in row 2 (third row), move it down two rows to row 4 (fifth row), replacing the 5 in that position. Then, set the original position in row 2 to 0. All other 5s in the fifth row stay as 5, except those that were replaced by 1s. The fourth row remains as is, except maybe if there's something else. Wait, looking at example 0, the fourth row in input was [0,0,5,0,0], and output is the same. So no changes to row 3 (the fourth row) except maybe the 5s there are untouched.\n\nSo the transformation steps could be:\n\n1. For each cell in the third row (row index 2), if the value is 1, then in the fifth row (row index 4), same column, replace the 5 with 1. Then set the original 1 in the third row to 0.\n\nBut wait, in the input, the fifth row is all 5s. So the 1s in the third row are moving down two rows to the fifth row, same column, turning those 5s into 1s. The third row's 1s become 0s.\n\nAlso, in the fourth row (row index 3), the values are 5s in the same columns as the 1s in the third row. But those 5s remain. For example, in Example 0, input's fourth row has a 5 in column 2, and in the output, that 5 is still there. The fifth row's column 2 becomes 1. So the 5 in the fourth row is not changed.\n\nSo the process is: find all 1s in the third row. For each such 1, set the corresponding fifth row's cell to 1 (if it was 5), and set the third row's cell to 0. The fourth row remains as is.\n\nNow let's check the test input. The test input's third row is [0,0,1,0,1]. So columns 2 and 4 (0-based index) have 1s. The fifth row is [5,5,5,5,5]. So according to the pattern, these 1s should move down two rows to the fifth row, columns 2 and 4. So in the output, fifth row would have 1s in positions 2 and 4, replacing the 5s. The third row's 1s become 0. The fourth row in the test input is [0,0,5,0,5]. So columns 2 and 4 have 5s. But according to previous examples, the fourth row's 5s remain. So in the output, the fourth row would still be [0,0,5,0,5]. The fifth row becomes [5,5,1,5,1]. Wait, but looking at the training examples, when there are two 1s, like in Example 1, the fifth row's columns 1 and 3 become 1s, and the fourth row's 5s stay.\n\nSo applying this to the test input:\n\nOriginal third row (index 2): [0,0,1,0,1] \u2192 columns 2 and 4 have 1s. So in the fifth row (index 4), columns 2 and 4 should become 1s, others remain 5. The third row becomes all 0s. The fourth row (index 3) is [0,0,5,0,5], which remains as is. The fifth row becomes [5,5,1,5,1]. So the output's fifth row would be [5,5,1,5,1].\n\nLet me check the expected output based on the pattern. The other rows in the output should remain as in the input except the third row becomes all 0s and the fifth row's specific columns. So the output for the test input would be:\n\n[0,0,0,0,0]\n[0,0,0,0,0]\n[0,0,0,0,0]  (third row all 0s)\n[0,0,5,0,5]  (fourth row unchanged)\n[5,5,1,5,1]  (fifth row with 1s at columns 2 and 4)",

        "cot_2": "Okay, let's see. I need to figure out the pattern from the training examples to apply it to the test input. Let's start by looking at each example and see what's changing between the input and output.\n\nLooking at Example 0:\n\nThe input has a 1 in the middle of the third row. The output then has that 1 moved down to the fifth row's middle. Wait, no. Let me check again. The third row in the input is [0,0,1,0,0], and the fourth row is [0,0,5,0,0]. The fifth row is all 5s. The output's third row is all zeros, fourth row still has a 5 in the middle, and the fifth row has the middle as 1 now. So the 1 from the third row moves down to the fifth row's middle, and the 5s in the fifth row are replaced except where the 1 is placed. Also, the 5 in the fourth row's middle stays.\n\nHmm. Maybe the 1s in the third row are moving down to the fifth row, swapping places with the 5s in the fifth row at the same column positions. Wait, in example 0, the third row's 1 is at position 2 (0-indexed). In the output fifth row, position 2 is 1, and the original fifth row had 5s. So the 1 in the third row is replacing the 5 in the same column of the fifth row. But the fourth row's 5 in the same column remains. So maybe there's a vertical swap between the third and fifth rows, but only for the columns where there's a 1 in the third row. Also, the 5s in the fifth row that are swapped become 1s, and the 1 becomes a 5?\n\nWait, in example 0's input, the fifth row is all 5s. In the output, the fifth row becomes [5,5,1,5,5]. So the middle element (column 2) changed from 5 to 1. And the third row's 1 became 0. Also, the fourth row's 5 in column 2 remained. So perhaps the 1 in the third row is moving down two rows to the fifth row, same column, and replacing the 5 there. But why?\n\nLooking at Example 1:\n\nInput third row is [0,1,0,1,0]. The fifth row is all 5s. The output fifth row becomes [5,1,5,1,5]. So the 1s from the third row columns 1 and 3 are now in the fifth row, same columns, and the fifth row's 5s in those columns are replaced by 1s. The fourth row's 5s in columns 1 and 3 remain. So same pattern: 1s in third row move to fifth row same column, replacing the 5s, and the original 1s in third row become 0. The fourth row's 5s stay as 5s.\n\nSimilarly, in Example 2:\n\nThird row input has 1s in columns 1 and 4. The output fifth row has 1s in columns 1 and 4, replacing the 5s there. The third row becomes 0s. The fourth row's 5s in those columns remain.\n\nSo the pattern seems to be:\n\nFor each cell in the third row (index 2), if there's a 1, then in the fifth row (index 4) at the same column, the 5 is replaced by 1. The original 1 in the third row becomes 0. The fourth row (index 3) remains unchanged.\n\nBut wait, in Example 0's input, the fourth row has a 5 in column 2. In the output, the fourth row still has 5 there. So the fourth row isn't changed. Only the third and fifth rows are modified.\n\nSo the transformation steps are:\n\n1. For each column in the third row (row index 2) that has a 1:\n   a. Replace the corresponding column in the fifth row (row index 4) from 5 to 1.\n   b. Set the third row's cell to 0.\n\n2. The fourth row (row index 3) remains the same.\n\nBut wait, in Example 0's input, the fourth row's column 2 is 5, and in the output, it's still 5. So no change to the fourth row. The fifth row's column 2 becomes 1, and the third row's column 2 becomes 0.\n\nSo applying this pattern to the test input.\n\nTest input:\n\nThird row (index 2) is [0,0,1,0,1]. So columns 2 and 4 have 1s. So in the fifth row (row 4), columns 2 and 4 would be changed from 5 to 1. The third row's columns 2 and 4 become 0. The fourth row (row 3) has in column 2 a 5 and column 4 a 5. These would stay as 5 in the output.\n\nSo the fifth row in the input is [5,5,5,5,5]. After replacement, columns 2 and 4 become 1, so [5,5,1,5,1]. The third row becomes [0,0,0,0,0]. The fourth row remains [0,0,5,0,5].\n\nSo the output should be:\n\n[0,0,0,0,0]\n\n[0,0,0,0,0]\n\n[0,0,0,0,0]\n\n[0,0,5,0,5]\n\n[5,5,1,5,1]\n\nLet me check against the training examples. For example, Example 2's input had third row [0,1,0,0,1], and output third row all zeros. The fifth row became [5,1,5,5,1]. Similarly, the test case's third row has 1s in columns 2 and 4, so fifth row columns 2 and 4 become 1, others 5. So yes, the fifth row would be [5,5,1,5,1].\n\nSo the output should look like that."
