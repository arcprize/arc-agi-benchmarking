        "cot_1": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. So, the task is to look at the input lists and see how they transform into the output lists. Let me start by looking at the training examples one by one.\n\nLooking at Example 0:\n\nInput:\n[4,4,0,3,3,0]\n[4,0,0,3,0,0]\n[0,0,0,0,0,3]\n\nOutput:\n[6,6,0]\n[6,0,0]\n[0,0,6]\n\nHmm. The input arrays have 6 elements each, and the output arrays have 3 elements. So maybe they're combining elements from the input in some way. Let's see. Let's take the first input array: [4,4,0,3,3,0]. The output is [6,6,0]. How does 4 and 4 turn into 6? 4+4 is 8, but that's not 6. Wait, maybe it's grouping them into pairs. Let's see:\n\nOriginal input arrays have 6 elements. If we group them into pairs, like (4,4), (0,3), (3,0) for the first input. Then maybe adding each pair and then applying some operation. Let's check:\n\nFor the first input pair (4,4): sum is 8. Output is 6. Hmm. 8 minus 2? Or maybe 4 + 4 = 8, but 8 divided by something? Not sure yet.\n\nWait, in the output for Example 0's first row, the first two elements are 6 and 6, then 0. Let me check the pairs again. Maybe each output element is the sum of two elements from the input, but only if both are non-zero. For example, the first pair is 4 and 4: sum is 8, but output is 6. So maybe 8 multiplied by 0.75? 8 * 0.75 is 6. Oh, that's possible. Let's check other pairs.\n\nSecond pair: 0 and 3. If one is zero, maybe the sum is 0. But in the output, the second element is 6. Wait, no. Wait, the output for the first input row is [6,6,0]. Let's see. Wait the input is [4,4,0,3,3,0]. If we split into three pairs: (4,4), (0,3), (3,0). For each pair, if both are non-zero, sum them and multiply by 0.75? So 4+4=8*0.75=6. Then (0,3) has a zero, so maybe that's not counted. Wait but the second element of the output is 6. Hmm, maybe I'm grouping wrong.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the input is divided into three groups of two elements each, and for each group, if both are non-zero, sum them and divide by (something) to get 6. Let's check:\n\nFirst group (4,4) sum to 8. 8 * 0.75 =6. Second group (0,3): since one is zero, maybe the sum is 3, but that's not matching. Or maybe it's (0 +3) * 2=6. Wait, that would make 6. Third group (3,0): same as second group. Sum 3, multiply by 2? But the third output is 0. Hmm, this doesn't add up.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the sum of each pair, but replacing 4 and 3 with 6? Wait, 4 and 3 sum to 7, but output is 6. Not sure.\n\nWait, looking at Example 0's input again. The first input row has elements 4,4,0,3,3,0. The output is [6,6,0]. The first two 4s become 6 each. Then the 0 and 3 become 6? But in the output, the second element is 6. Wait, maybe each pair is being considered, and if both are non-zero, they are replaced by 6. Otherwise, the sum or something else.\n\nWait, first pair (4,4) \u2192 6 and 6? But output is [6,6,0]. Wait no, the output array has three elements. So perhaps each element in the output is formed by combining two elements from the input. For example, the first output element is 4 + 4 = 8, but 8 is converted to 6. The second output element is 0 +3=3, but converted to 6. The third is 3+0=3, but output is 0. Hmm, this doesn't make sense. \n\nWait maybe each pair of elements in the input is summed and then multiplied by a certain factor. For instance, in the first input example, the pairs sum to 8, 3, 3. But the output is 6,6,0. So 8 becomes 6 (8 * 0.75), 3 becomes 6 (3 * 2), and 3 becomes 0. That's inconsistent. Hmm.\n\nLet me check another example. Example 1:\n\nInput:\n[4,0,4,3,3,0]\n[4,0,0,3,0,0]\n[0,0,4,3,0,0]\n\nOutput:\n[6,6,6]\n[6,0,0]\n[6,0,6]\n\nLooking at the first input row: [4,0,4,3,3,0]. The output is [6,6,6]. Let's split into pairs (4,0), (4,3), (3,0). The sum for each pair: 4,7,3. But the output is 6,6,6. So maybe if either element in the pair is non-zero, the output is 6. Wait, but that would give all 6s here, which matches the output. Let's check:\n\nFirst pair (4,0): at least one is non-zero \u2192 6. Second pair (4,3): both non-zero \u21926. Third pair (3,0) \u21926. So the output is three 6s. That matches the first output row.\n\nSo the rule might be: for each pair of elements in the input (grouped as two consecutive elements), if there is at least one non-zero in the pair, output 6. Otherwise, 0. Wait, but in Example 0's first input row, the pairs are (4,4), (0,3), (3,0). So all pairs have at least one non-zero. Then output should be [6,6,6], but the actual output is [6,6,0]. Wait, that contradicts.\n\nHmm. So maybe there's a different approach. Let's look at the numbers 4 and 3 in the input. In the outputs, 6 appears. So maybe 4 + 3 =7, but 6 is the result. Wait, perhaps 4 and 3 are replaced by 6. Let's see:\n\nIn Example 0's first input row: 4,4,0,3,3,0. The numbers 4 and 3 are present. The output elements are 6,6,0. Wait, maybe each 4 or 3 in the input is converted to 6 in the output. But how do they combine?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the sum of all 4s and 3s in each column is taken. Wait, but the inputs are rows. Wait, maybe each output element corresponds to a column in the input. Let's see:\n\nLooking at the structure of the inputs and outputs. Each input example has three rows, each with six numbers. The output has three rows, each with three numbers. So perhaps each output row corresponds to an input row, and each output element in the row is derived from two input elements. For example, each output row has three elements, each derived from two elements in the input row.\n\nIn Example 0, input row 1 is [4,4,0,3,3,0]. Output row is [6,6,0]. So the input row is split into three pairs: (4,4), (0,3), (3,0). Then each pair is transformed into 6,6,0. So for (4,4) \u21926, (0,3) \u21926, (3,0) \u21920. Hmm. How?\n\nWait, perhaps 4 and 3 in the input are being converted to 6, but if a pair has both 4 and 3, then it's 6. Or maybe the sum is (4+4) =8, which is 6 when divided by (something). But 8/ (4/3) ) is 6. Not sure.\n\nWait, looking at the numbers in the input: 4 and 3. The output is 6. Maybe 4 and 3 are being converted to 6, but how? 4 +3=7, but 7 isn't 6. Alternatively, 4 and 3 are replaced by their maximum multiplied by 1.5. 4*1.5=6, 3*2=6. Hmm, maybe that's it. So if a number is 4, multiply by 1.5 (4*1.5=6). If it's 3, multiply by 2 (3*2=6). But how does that work with pairs?\n\nWait, maybe each pair of elements in the input row is processed by converting each 4 to 6 and each 3 to 6, then combining them. For example, in the pair (4,4), each becomes 6, sum is 12. But the output is 6. So perhaps taking the average? 12 / 2 =6. That makes sense. For a pair (4,3), converted to 6 and 6, sum is 12, average is 6. For a pair (0,3), converted to 0 and 6, sum is 6, average is 3. But that doesn't explain the output. Wait in Example 0's first row, the pair (0,3) would convert to 0 and 6. Sum is 6, average 3. But the output is 6. So that's not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe if either element in the pair is non-zero (after conversion), the output is 6. But in the first example, the third pair (3,0) converted to 6 and 0. So at least one is non-zero, so 6. But the output is 0. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each pair is summed after converting 4 and 3 to 6. Then, if the sum is 12 (like two 6s), output 6. If sum is 6 (like 6 and 0), then output 6. But in Example 0's first input row, the third pair is (3,0) converted to 6 and 0. Sum is 6, which would output 6, but the output is 0. That contradicts.\n\nHmm. Maybe I need to think differently. Let's look at another example. Example 1's input first row is [4,0,4,3,3,0]. Output is [6,6,6]. Let's split into pairs (4,0), (4,3), (3,0). Converting each to 6 and 0: (6,0), (6,6), (6,0). Then perhaps sum each pair and divide by 2. So (6+0)/2=3, but output is 6. So that's not working.\n\nWait, perhaps instead of pairs, the output is taking every other element. For example, input row [4,4,0,3,3,0]. Taking elements 0, 2, 4 (indices starting at 0) \u21924,0,3. Then converting 4 to 6 and 3 to 6 \u2192 [6,0,6]. But the output is [6,6,0]. No, that's not matching.\n\nAlternatively, the output is combining the first two elements, next two, last two. But how?\n\nWait, looking at Example 3's input:\n\nInput:\n[4,4,0,3,0,0]\n[0,0,0,0,0,3]\n[4,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nOutput:\n[6,6,0]\n[0,0,6]\n[6,0,0]\n\nSo for the first input row: [4,4,0,3,0,0]. The pairs are (4,4), (0,3), (0,0). The output is [6,6,0]. So the first two pairs are non-zero, so 6 each. The third pair is zero, so 0. But how does (0,3) become 6? Because 0 and 3 sum to 3. But in the output it's 6. So maybe the rule is: for each pair, if the sum is non-zero, output 6. Otherwise 0. Then (4+4)=8 \u21926; (0+3)=3 \u21926; (0+0)=0 \u21920. But why 8 becomes 6? Because 8 is converted to 6, 3 is converted to 6. So the sum of the pair is replaced by 6 regardless of the sum, as long as the sum is non-zero. So any pair that sums to a non-zero value becomes 6. If the pair sums to zero, then 0.\n\nBut then, in Example 0's first input row, the third pair is (3,0) which sums to 3 \u21926, but the output is 0. That contradicts. So that can't be the case.\n\nHmm. Maybe the rule is that if a pair contains a 4 or a 3, then it becomes 6. But in the pair (3,0), there's a 3, so it becomes 6. But in Example 0's first input row, the third pair (3,0) would output 6, but the actual output is 0. So that's not right.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's based on the presence of 4s and 3s in the entire row. For example, the sum of all 4s and 3s in the input row is converted to 6s. But that's not matching. For example, in Example 0's first input row, there are four 4s and two 3s. Sum would be 4*4 +3*2= 16 +6=22. How does that become three 6s?\n\nNot sure. Let's think of another angle. The output rows have three elements, each corresponding to two columns in the input rows. Maybe each element in the output is the sum of the corresponding two columns across all three input rows. Wait, let's check Example 0.\n\nOriginal input:\n\nRow 0: [4,4,0,3,3,0]\nRow 1: [4,0,0,3,0,0]\nRow 2: [0,0,0,0,0,3]\n\nOutput:\n\nRow 0: [6,6,0]\nRow 1: [6,0,0]\nRow 2: [0,0,6]\n\nIf the output is formed by combining the first two columns of each input row into the first element of the output row, then the next two, etc. Let's see:\n\nFor Output row 0, first element 6. How is that from the first two columns of input rows:\n\nRow 0: 4,4\n\nRow 1:4,0\n\nRow 2:0,0\n\nSum: (4+4)+(4+0)+(0+0) =8+4+0=12. But output is 6. Maybe sum per input row pair, then if the sum is non-zero, add 6. But that's unclear.\n\nAlternatively, for each output element, take the sum of the corresponding two columns across all three input rows, then divide by something. For Example 0, first output element is 6. Let's see the input columns 0 and 1 across all rows:\n\nRow 0:4 and4 \u2192 sum 8\n\nRow1:4 and0 \u2192 sum4\n\nRow2:0 and0 \u2192 sum0\n\nTotal sum 8+4+0=12. 12/2=6. So the output element is 6. Second output element is 6. Columns 2 and3:\n\nRow0:0 and3 \u21923\n\nRow1:0 and3 \u21923\n\nRow2:0 and0 \u21920\n\nSum 3+3=6. 6/1 (number of non-zero pairs?) \u21926. Third output element is 0. Columns 4 and5:\n\nRow0:3 and0 \u21923\n\nRow1:0 and0 \u21920\n\nRow2:0 and3 \u21923\n\nSum 3+3=6. Divided by 2 is 3. But output is 0. Hmm, this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe for each pair in the input rows, if there's a 4 and/or 3 in the pair, it's counted as 6. But how?\n\nAlternatively, looking at the output and the input for each row, maybe the output is the count of 4s and 3s in each pair multiplied by 6. For example, in Example 0's first input row, the first pair (4,4) has two 4s. 2 * 3 =6. But then, 3*2=6. Wait, but 4 and 3 are both converted to 6. So maybe each 4 or 3 in the pair contributes 3 to the output. Like, for each 4 or 3 in the pair, add 3, then sum. So for (4,4) \u21923+3=6. (0,3) \u21920+3=3. But output is 6. So that's not matching.\n\nAlternatively, each 4 or 3 in the input is replaced by 6, then the output is the sum of each pair divided by 2 (average). So for Example 0's first input row:\n\n[4,4,0,3,3,0] \u2192 [6,6,0,6,6,0]. Then pairs (6,6), (0,6), (6,0). Average of each pair: (6,6)\u21926, (0+6)/2=3, (6+0)/2=3. But the output is [6,6,0]. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe if both elements in the pair are non-zero (after converting 4 and 3 to 6), then the output is 6. Otherwise, sum divided by 2. Let's test:\n\nExample 0's first pair (4,4) \u21926,6. Both non-zero. Output 6.\n\nSecond pair (0,3) \u21920,6. One is zero. Sum is 6, average 3. But output is 6. So that doesn't fit.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Let's try another example. Example 2's output has [0,6,6], [6,6,6], [6,6,6]. Let's look at the input for Example 2:\n\nInput:\n\n[0,0,4,0,3,0]\n\n[0,4,4,3,0,3]\n\n[4,4,0,0,0,3]\n\nOutput rows:\n\n[0,6,6]\n\n[6,6,6]\n\n[6,6,6]\n\nHmm. Let's take the first input row: [0,0,4,0,3,0]. Split into pairs (0,0), (4,0), (3,0). Output is [0,6,6]. So for (0,0), sum is 0 \u2192 output 0. For (4,0) \u21926. For (3,0) \u21926. So maybe if the pair contains at least one 4 or 3, output 6. If both are zero, output 0. That would make sense here. So (0,0) \u21920, (4,0) \u21926, (3,0)\u21926. Which matches the output [0,6,6].\n\nYes, this seems to fit. Let's check other examples. Example 0's first input row: pairs are (4,4), (0,3), (3,0). Each pair has at least one 4 or 3. So output should be [6,6,6]. But the actual output is [6,6,0]. Wait, that's conflicting.\n\nHmm. So that can't be the rule. Because in Example 0's first row, third pair is (3,0), which has a 3, so output should be 6, but actual output is 0. So this contradicts.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is that if both elements in the pair are non-zero and are either 4 or 3, then output 6. Otherwise, 0. Let's check:\n\nExample 0's first pair (4,4) \u2192 both are non-zero and 4s \u21926. Second pair (0,3) \u2192 one is zero \u21920. Third pair (3,0) \u2192 one is zero \u21920. So output would be [6,0,0]. But the actual output is [6,6,0]. So no.\n\nWait, but the output in Example 0's first row is [6,6,0]. The first pair (4,4) \u21926. Second pair (0,3) \u21926. Third pair (3,0) \u21920. So why the second pair gives 6? Maybe because one element is 3 (or 4) and the other is non-zero. Wait, but in (0,3), the 0 is zero, but 3 is non-zero. So maybe the rule is: for each pair, if there's at least one 4 or 3, then output 6. But in Example 0's third pair (3,0), there's a 3, so it should be 6, but output is 0. So that's a problem.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the sum of the pair must be exactly 8 (4+4) or 7 (4+3) or 6 (3+3). Then convert that sum to 6. But Example 0's third pair is 3+0=3, which doesn't fit.\n\nWait, looking back at Example 0's output, the third element is 0. The third pair in the input is (3,0). If the rule is that the sum of the pair must be 7 or 8, then 3+0=3, which is not 7 or 8, so output 0. But then why does the second pair (0,3) sum to 3, but output is 6? This doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. Maybe the transformation is not based on pairs but on the position in the row. For example, each output element is a combination of two columns from the input. Like, column 0 and 1 become output column 0, columns 2 and 3 become output column 1, and columns 4 and 5 become output column 2. Then, for each of these, if there's a 4 and a 3 in the pair, they sum to 6. Or something else.\n\nLet me try this with Example 0's first input row: columns 0 and 1 are 4 and4. Output column 0 is 6. Columns 2 and3 are 0 and3 \u2192 sum is 3. Output is 6. Columns4 and5 are3 and0 \u2192 sum 3. Output is 0. So this approach isn't directly adding.\n\nAlternatively, maybe for each pair of columns (0-1, 2-3, 4-5), count the number of 4s and 3s. Each 4 or 3 counts as 1, and multiply by 3. For example, if there are two 4s or two 3s, then 2*3=6. If there's one, then 3. But in Example 0's first pair (4,4): two 4s \u21926. Second pair (0,3): one 3 \u21923. But output is 6. Doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, if a pair has any 4 or 3, output 6. Else 0. So for (4,4) \u21926. (0,3) \u21926. (3,0) \u21926. But the output is [6,6,0]. So why is the third element 0?\n\nThis is really confusing. Let's look at another example. Example 4's input:\n\nInput:\n\n[0,0,0,0,3,0]\n\n[4,0,0,0,0,0]\n\n[0,0,4,3,3,0]\n\nOutput:\n\n[0,6,0]\n\n[6,0,0]\n\n[6,6,6]\n\nFor the third input row: [0,0,4,3,3,0]. Split into pairs (0,0), (4,3), (3,0). The output is [6,6,6]. So for (0,0) \u21926? That can't be. Unless the pairs are columns 0-1, 2-3, 4-5. Wait (0,0) \u21920 and0 \u2192 output 6? Doesn't fit.\n\nWait maybe the output is formed by looking at the three rows for each column pair. For example, the first output column is the combination of the first two columns across all three input rows. Let's try Example 0:\n\nFirst output column for all three output rows is 6,6,0. Let's look at the first two columns in each input row:\n\nRow0:4,4 \u2192 both non-zero. \n\nRow1:4,0 \u2192 one non-zero.\n\nRow2:0,0 \u2192 both zero.\n\nMaybe if in any of the three input rows, the pair has both elements non-zero, then the output for that row's first element is 6. But in Example0's first input row, pair (4,4) \u2192 both non-zero, so output is 6. Second input row's pair (4,0) \u2192 only one non-zero, so output is 0. Third input row's pair (0,0) \u2192 both zero, output 0. But the output rows are [6,6,0], [6,0,0], [0,0,6]. Hmm, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe for each input row's pair, if the pair has any non-zero elements (after converting 4 and 3 to 6), then output 6. But that doesn't explain the third element in Example0's first row.\n\nWait, perhaps the answer is that each 4 and 3 in the input is replaced by 6, and then the output is the sum of each pair divided by 2 (taking average). For example, in Example0's first input row:\n\nOriginal: [4,4,0,3,3,0]\n\nConvert to 6s: [6,6,0,6,6,0]\n\nPairs: (6,6) \u2192 average 6, (0,6) \u2192 average 3, (6,0) \u2192 average 3.\n\nBut output is [6,6,0]. So this doesn't match.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the sum of each pair (after converting 4 and 3 to 6) is taken, and if the sum is >=6, then output 6, else 0. For Example0's first row:\n\nPairs after conversion: (6,6) sum 12 \u21926, (0,6) sum 6 \u21926, (6,0) sum6 \u21926. Output should be [6,6,6], but actual output is [6,6,0]. So that's not it.\n\nThis is really challenging. Maybe the pattern is that in each pair of the input row, if there's a 4 or a 3, replace it with 6, then add them. If the sum is 12 (both 6s), output 6. If sum is 6 (one 6), output 6. If sum is 0, output 0. But in Example0's first row, the third pair is (3,0) \u21926 and0. Sum 6 \u2192 output 6. But the output is 0. So that's conflicting.\n\nWait, perhaps the direction is vertical instead of horizontal. Let's think about the input as three rows, and the output as three rows, but each output column is derived from two columns in the input. For example, each output column is the combination of two input columns across all three rows. Let's see:\n\nExample0's input has three rows. Let's look at the first two columns:\n\nColumn0:4,4,0\n\nColumn1:4,0,0\n\nCombine these two columns across three rows. Maybe sum them and convert to 6. For example, 4+4+0=8, 4+0+0=4. Sum of both columns per row:\n\nRow0:4+4=8 \u21926\n\nRow1:4+0=4 \u21926? No.\n\nWait, this approach doesn't seem to fit.\n\nAlternatively, for each pair of columns (columns 0 and1, 2 and3, 4 and5), look down the three rows. For each pair of columns, if there's a 4 or 3 in any of the three rows for that column pair, output 6. Otherwise 0. But not sure.\n\nFor Example0, the first pair of columns (0 and1) in each row:\n\nRow0:4,4 \u2192 has 4s \u21926\n\nRow1:4,0 \u2192 has 4 \u21926\n\nRow2:0,0 \u2192 no \u21920\n\nSo for the first output column, the output rows are [6,6,0]. Which matches Example0's output first column. The second pair of columns (2 and3):\n\nRow0:0,3 \u21923 \u21926\n\nRow1:0,3 \u21923 \u21926\n\nRow2:0,0 \u21920 \u21920\n\nSo second output column would be [6,6,0]. But Example0's output's second column is [6,0,0]. Hmm, that doesn't fit.\n\nThis is getting too complicated. Let's try to find a different pattern.\n\nLooking at all examples, the output consists of 6s and 0s. So the transformation must involve replacing certain numbers with 6 and others with 0. The inputs have 4s, 3s, and 0s.\n\nNotice that 4 +3 =7, but 6 is present in the output. Wait, maybe 4 and 3 are being converted to 6. For example, any occurrence of 4 or 3 in the input becomes 6 in the output. But then, the output would have 6s wherever there's a 4 or 3 in the input, and 0 otherwise. But the output arrays have fewer elements. So perhaps the input's 6 elements are being merged into 3 by combining pairs and converting 4/3 to 6.\n\nFor example, each pair in the input row is checked: if there's a 4 or 3 in the pair, the output is 6 for that pair. Otherwise, 0.\n\nSo for each pair (two consecutive elements in the input row), if either element is 4 or 3, then the output for that pair is 6. Otherwise, 0.\n\nLet's test this hypothesis with the examples.\n\nExample0, first input row: [4,4,0,3,3,0]\n\nPairs: (4,4) \u21926, (0,3) \u21926, (3,0) \u21926. So output would be [6,6,6]. But the actual output is [6,6,0]. So that's not matching.\n\nHmm. But the third pair is (3,0), which includes a 3, so should be 6. But output is 0. So this can't be the rule.\n\nAlternative approach: Maybe the output is formed by checking if the sum of each pair is a multiple of 7. But that's not leading to 6.\n\nWait, maybe the output is 6 whenever there's a 4 or 3 in the pair, but only if the other element is not zero. So pairs like (4,4) \u2192 both non-zero \u21926. (4,0) \u2192 one non-zero (4) \u21926. (0,3) \u2192 one non-zero (3) \u21926. (3,0) \u2192 same as previous \u21926. But this doesn't fit Example0's output where the third element is 0.\n\nAlternatively, the pair must have at least one 4 or 3 AND both elements are non-zero. So (4,4) \u2192 both non-zero \u21926. (0,3) \u2192 3 is non-zero, but 0 is zero \u2192 so output 0. (3,0) \u2192 same \u21920. So for Example0's first input row, the output would be [6,0,0], which doesn't match the actual output [6,6,0]. So this isn't correct.\n\nExample0's output is [6,6,0]. So first pair gives 6, second pair 6, third pair 0. Let's look at the pairs again:\n\nPair1:4,4 \u2192 both non-zero and 4s \u21926.\n\nPair2:0,3 \u2192 3 is non-zero \u21926.\n\nPair3:3,0 \u21923 is non-zero \u21926. But output is 0. So this doesn't fit.\n\nThis is really confusing. Let me try to look for another pattern. Let's consider that the output is the sum of the two elements in each pair, then divided by a certain factor. For Example0's first input row:\n\nPair1:4+4=8 \u21926 (8*0.75=6).\n\nPair2:0+3=3 \u21926 (3*2=6).\n\nPair3:3+0=3 \u21920.\n\nBut why 3 turns into 0? That doesn't make sense.\n\nAlternatively, if the sum is 8 or 3, but how?\n\nAlternatively, the sum of each pair is multiplied by 0.75 if it's 8, or 2 if it's 3. So Pair1 sum 8 \u21926, Pair2 sum3 \u21926, Pair3 sum3 \u21926. But output is [6,6,0], so third pair is 0. So that doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. Maybe the transformation is based on the presence of 4s and 3s in specific positions. For example, each 4 and 3 is replaced by 6, and then the pairs are summed. But the output is then divided by the number of non-zero elements in the pair. For example:\n\nIn Example0's first pair (4,4) \u21926,6. Sum 12. Number of non-zero elements: 2. 12/2=6 \u2192 output 6.\n\nSecond pair (0,3) \u21920,6. Sum 6. Number of non-zero elements:1. 6/1=6 \u2192 output 6.\n\nThird pair (3,0) \u21926,0. Sum6. Divided by 1 \u21926. But output is 0. So that's conflicting.\n\nAlternatively, maybe only pairs where both elements are non-zero (after conversion to 6) result in 6. Otherwise, 0. So:\n\nExample0's first pair (6,6) \u21926.\n\nSecond pair (0,6) \u21920.\n\nThird pair (6,0) \u21920.\n\nBut output is [6,6,0]. So this doesn't fit.\n\nWait, but in Example0's first output row, the third element is 0. The third pair in the input is (3,0). If the pair has one 3 and one 0, maybe if the sum is even, output 6. Sum is 3, which is odd \u21920. Sum is 8 (4+4) even \u21926. Sum 3 is odd \u21920. Sum 3 again \u21920. So Example0's output would be [6,0,0]. But actual output is [6,6,0]. So no.\n\nThis is taking a lot of time, but I need to find the pattern. Let's think of the output as being related to the number of 4s and 3s in the entire input matrices. For example, each 4 and 3 contributes to a 6 in the output, but arranged in some way. But how?\n\nAlternatively, the output is formed by treating each pair in the input as a binary presence of 4 or 3. For example, each pair's output is 6 if there's at least one 4 or 3 in the pair. Otherwise 0. But again, Example0's third pair (3,0) would be 6, but output is 0.\n\nWait, looking at Example0's input, the third pair in the first row is (3,0). The third output element is 0. But there's a 3 there. So why is it 0?\n\nAh! Maybe the output is based on columns across all three input rows. Let's think of the input as three rows of six elements each. The output is three rows of three elements each. Each output element corresponds to two columns (like columns 0 and1, 2 and3, 4 and5) across the three input rows. For each of these pairs, if in any of the three input rows, both elements in the pair are non-zero (i.e., not zero), then the corresponding output element in that row is 6. Otherwise, 0.\n\nLet's test this with Example0:\n\nInput rows:\n\nRow0: [4,4,0,3,3,0]\n\nRow1: [4,0,0,3,0,0]\n\nRow2: [0,0,0,0,0,3]\n\nOutput rows:\n\n[6,6,0]\n\n[6,0,0]\n\n[0,0,6]\n\nFirst pair (columns0-1):\n\nRow0:4,4 \u2192 both non-zero \u2192 output row0 first element is 6.\n\nRow1:4,0 \u2192 not both non-zero \u2192 output row1 first element is 0 (but actual output is 6). Hmm, no.\n\nWait, this isn't matching. Maybe the output element for a row is 6 if in that row, the pair has both elements non-zero. So for Example0's first row:\n\nPair0:4,4 \u2192 both non-zero \u21926.\n\nPair1:0,3 \u2192 not both \u21920.\n\nPair2:3,0 \u2192 not both \u21920. But the output is [6,6,0]. So the second pair in the first row is 0 and3 \u2192 one zero. So why is the output 6 there?\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's if either element in the pair is non-zero. So for Example0's first row:\n\nPair0:4,4 \u2192 both non-zero \u21926.\n\nPair1:0,3 \u2192 one non-zero \u21926.\n\nPair2:3,0 \u2192 one non-zero \u21926. So output would be [6,6,6], but actual output is [6,6,0]. So this doesn't fit.\n\nWait, but the actual output is [6,6,0]. So the third element is 0. So perhaps the rule is that if both elements are non-zero, output 6; if one is non-zero and the other is 3 or 4, output 6; otherwise 0. That's vague.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for each pair in the input row, if the pair contains at least one 4, output 6. If it contains at least one 3 but no 4s, output 6. Otherwise, 0. Let's check:\n\nExample0's first row:\n\nPair0:4 and4 \u2192 has 4s \u21926.\n\nPair1:0 and3 \u2192 has 3 \u21926.\n\nPair2:3 and0 \u2192 has 3 \u21926. But output is [6,6,0]. So why is the third pair 0?\n\nThis isn't working. Maybe the presence of a 3 in a pair requires the other element to be a 3 or 4 to output 6. For example, if a pair has a 3 and a non-3/4 element (like 0), then output 0. \n\nExample0's third pair (3,0): 3 and 0 \u2192 output 0. Second pair (0,3):0 and3 \u2192 output 0. But in the first output row of Example0, the second element is 6, so that contradicts.\n\nThis is really tough. Let me try to look for another angle. Maybe the output rows are the sum of the corresponding input rows, but with 4s and 3s converted to 6 and then each pair summed.\n\nFor example, Example0's first input row: [4,4,0,3,3,0]. Convert to [6,6,0,6,6,0]. Then sum pairs: 6+6=12, 0+6=6, 6+0=6. But output is [6,6,0]. So this doesn't fit. Unless we take the average. 12/2=6, 6/2=3, 6/2=3. But output is [6,6,0].\n\nAlternatively, after converting to 6s, the output for each pair is 6 if both are non-zero, otherwise 0. So:\n\nPair0:6 and6 \u21926.\n\nPair1:0 and6 \u21920.\n\nPair2:6 and0 \u21920. Output would be [6,0,0]. But actual output is [6,6,0]. So no.\n\nAlternatively, if either element is non-zero after conversion, output 6. So:\n\nPair0:6 and6 \u21926.\n\nPair1:0 and6 \u21926.\n\nPair2:6 and0 \u21926. Output [6,6,6], but actual output is [6,6,0].\n\nNo.\n\nThis is really frustrating. Let me look at Example3:\n\nInput:\n\n[4,4,0,3,0,0]\n\n[0,0,0,0,0,3]\n\n[4,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nOutput:\n\n[6,6,0]\n\n[0,0,6]\n\n[6,0,0]\n\nFirst input row: [4,4,0,3,0,0]. Converted to 6,6,0,6,0,0. Pairs are (6,6), (0,6), (0,0). Output [6,6,0]. So first pair \u21926, second pair \u21926, third \u21920. But (0,6) \u21926 and (0,0) \u21920. So maybe if the pair has at least one 6 (converted) and the other is also non-zero (after conversion), then 6. Or if at least one 6, then 6. So for (6,6)\u21926, (0,6)\u21926, (0,0)\u21920. Which matches the output.\n\nYes! So the pattern seems to be: Convert each 4 or 3 in the input to 6. Then, for each pair of elements in the input row (grouped as two consecutive elements), if either element is 6 (converted from 4 or 3), output 6. Else, output 0.\n\nWait, but in Example0's first row:\n\nConverted input: [6,6,0,6,6,0]. Pairs: (6,6), (0,6), (6,0). So each pair has at least one 6. So output should be [6,6,6]. But actual output is [6,6,0]. So that doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. Then maybe the rule is that the pair must have both elements non-zero (original) and at least one of them is 4 or 3. So:\n\nPair0:4 and4 \u2192 both non-zero and 4s \u21926.\n\nPair1:0 and3 \u2192 one is zero \u21920.\n\nPair2:3 and0 \u2192 one is zero \u21920.\n\nBut output is [6,6,0]. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, the pair must have at least one 4 or 3, and the sum of the pair is not zero. Which would be the same as having at least one 4 or 3 and the pair sum is non-zero. But that's the same as the pair containing a 4 or 3.\n\nI'm really stuck. Let me look at the test input and see if I can find a pattern there.\n\nTest Input:\n\n[0,4,4,3,0,0]\n\n[4,0,0,3,3,0]\n\n[0,4,0,3,0,0]\n\nIf I apply the rule that each pair in the input row is converted to 6 if there's at least one 4 or 3, else 0.\n\nLet's process each row:\n\nFirst row: [0,4,4,3,0,0]\n\nPairs: (0,4), (4,3), (0,0).\n\nAt least one 4/3 in each pair except last. So output would be [6,6,0].\n\nSecond row: [4,0,0,3,3,0]\n\nPairs: (4,0), (0,3), (3,0). All have at least one 4/3 \u2192 [6,6,6].\n\nThird row: [0,4,0,3,0,0]\n\nPairs: (0,4), (0,3), (0,0). First two pairs have 4/3 \u2192 [6,6,0].\n\nBut according to the examples, the outputs sometimes have 6 even if only one element is non-zero, like Example0's second pair (0,3) \u21926.\n\nBut according to this rule, the test input would output:\n\n[6,6,0]\n\n[6,6,6]\n\n[6,6,0]\n\nBut looking at the training examples, for example Example1's output:\n\n[6,6,6]\n\n[6,0,0]\n\n[6,0,6]\n\nWhich suggests that this rule may not be consistent. For instance, in Example1's third input row: [0,0,4,3,0,0]. Pairs: (0,0) \u21920, (4,3)\u21926, (0,0)\u21920. So output should be [0,6,0], but the actual output is [6,0,6]. So this doesn't fit.\n\nI'm going in circles here. Let me try to see if there's another pattern. Maybe the output is the number of 4s and 3s in each pair multiplied by 3.\n\nFor Example0's first pair: 2 4s \u21922*3=6. Second pair: 1 3 \u21921*3=3. But output is 6. So that's not.\n\nAlternatively, the number of 4s and 3s in the pair. If there's at least one, output 6. Otherwise 0. Which would align with some examples but not others.\n\nAnother idea: maybe each 4 and 3 is replaced by 6, and then each pair's elements are summed. If the sum is greater than or equal to 6, output 6. Otherwise 0. For Example0's first input row:\n\nConverted to [6,6,0,6,6,0]. Pairs: 6+6=12 \u21926, 0+6=6 \u21926, 6+0=6 \u21926. Output [6,6,6]. But actual output is [6,6,0]. So no.\n\nAlternatively, sum of the pair after conversion must be exactly 12 (two 6s). So first pair 12 \u21926. Second pair 6 \u21920. Third pair 6 \u21920. But output is [6,6,0]. No.\n\nThis is really challenging. Given the time I've spent and the need to provide an answer, I'll proceed with the hypothesis that each pair in the input row is converted to 6 if there is at least one 4 or 3, otherwise 0. Then, for the test input:\n\nFirst row: [0,4,4,3,0,0]\n\nPairs: (0,4) \u21926, (4,3)\u21926, (0,0)\u21920 \u2192 output [6,6,0].\n\nSecond row: [4,0,0,3,3,0]\n\nPairs: (4,0)\u21926, (0,3)\u21926, (3,0)\u21926 \u2192 output [6,6,6].\n\nThird row: [0,4,0,3,0,0]\n\nPairs: (0,4)\u21926, (0,3)\u21926, (0,0)\u21920 \u2192 output [6,6,0].\n\nBut looking at Example0's output, which under this hypothesis should have [6,6,6] but actual is [6,6,0], this rule is invalid. So perhaps there's an exception when the pair has a 3 and a 0, the output is 0. Or maybe when the pair has a 3 and a 0, but in a certain position.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is 6 if the pair contains a 4, and 6 if it contains a 3 but only if paired with another 3 or 4. Otherwise, 0. For example:\n\nIn Example0's first row, third pair (3,0): 3 is present but paired with 0 \u21920.\n\nSecond pair (0,3): 3 paired with 0 \u21920. But the output is 6. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAt this point, I think the most plausible pattern, despite some inconsistencies, is that each pair in the input row converts to 6 if there's at least one 4 or 3 in the pair, else 0. Then, applying this to the test input:\n\nTest Input:\n\nRow0: [0,4,4,3,0,0] \u2192 pairs (0,4), (4,3), (0,0) \u2192 6,6,0.\n\nRow1: [4,0,0,3,3,0] \u2192 pairs (4,0), (0,3), (3,0) \u21926,6,6.\n\nRow2: [0,4,0,3,0,0] \u2192 pairs (0,4), (0,3), (0,0) \u21926,6,0.\n\nSo the output would be:\n\n[6,6,0]\n\n[6,6,6]\n\n[6,6,0]\n\nBut looking at the training examples, there are cases where a pair with 3 and 0 outputs 6 (like Example0's second pair). So this must be correct. But why in Example0's third pair (3,0) the output is 0? According to this rule, it should be 6. So perhaps there's an error in my hypothesis.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is that the pair must contain both a 4 and a 3 to output 6. If the pair has only 4s, output 6. If the pair has only 3s, output 6. If the pair has a mix of 4 and 3, output 6. If the pair has a 4 or 3 with a zero, output 0.\n\nWait, let's check Example0:\n\nRow0: [4,4,0,3,3,0]\n\nPairs: (4,4)\u21926, (0,3)\u21920, (3,0)\u21920. Output [6,0,0]. But actual output is [6,6,0]. So this doesn't fit.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternatively, if the pair contains any 4, output 6. If the pair contains any 3 but no 4, output 6. Otherwise 0. So:\n\nExample0's first row:\n\n(4,4) \u21926, (0,3) \u21926 (since has 3), (3,0) \u21926 (has 3). Output [6,6,6]. But actual is [6,6,0].\n\nNo.\n\nAt this point, given the time constraints, I'll proceed with the initial hypothesis, even though it doesn't explain all examples, and see if the test input's output matches the training examples' pattern.",

        "cot_2": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. So, looking at the training examples, each input is a list of three rows, each with six numbers. The output is a list of three rows, each with three numbers. So the output has half the number of elements per row as the input. That makes me think maybe the input is being split into pairs and then combined somehow.\n\nLooking at Example 0:\n\nInput rows are:\n[4,4,0,3,3,0]\n[4,0,0,3,0,0]\n[0,0,0,0,0,3]\n\nOutput rows are:\n[6,6,0]\n[6,0,0]\n[0,0,6]\n\nHmm. Let's see. Each input row has six elements. If I split each into three pairs, like (4,4), (0,3), (3,0) for the first input row. Then summing each pair: 4+4=8, but the output is 6. Wait, that's not matching. Alternatively, maybe it's the sum but modulo something. Or maybe it's counting the non-zero elements and multiplying by a certain number.\n\nWait, in example 0's first input row: [4,4,0,3,3,0]. The output is [6,6,0]. Let's check each pair:\n\nFirst pair 4,4: sum is 8. But output is 6. Hmm. Maybe the count of non-zero numbers in each pair? For 4,4: both are non-zero. So count 2. Then 2 * 3 = 6? Because 2*3=6. Then next pair 0,3: one non-zero. 1*3=3, but output here is 6. Wait, no. The output here is 6, but according to that logic, the sum would be 3. Doesn't fit.\n\nWait, maybe another approach. Let's look at the sum of each pair, but if the sum is non-zero, replace it with 6. Let's see. First pair 4+4=8 \u2192 6? 0+3=3 \u2192 6? 3+0=3 \u2192 6? But the output for first row is [6,6,0]. Wait, the third pair sum is 3+0=3, but output is 0. That doesn't fit. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the product of the two numbers in the pair. For example 0's first input pair 4*4=16. Not sure how that becomes 6. Maybe sum digits? 4+4=8. Still not 6.\n\nWait, maybe each pair is being checked for having two non-zero elements. If both are non-zero, then 6, else sum. Let's see. First pair 4 and4: both non-zero \u2192 6. Second pair 0 and3: one non-zero \u2192 3. But output here is 6. So that doesn't work.\n\nLooking at example 0's third input row: [0,0,0,0,0,3]. Split into (0,0), (0,0), (0,3). Output is [0,0,6]. So the third pair here has one non-zero (3), but output is 6. Wait, so perhaps the number of non-zero elements in the pair multiplied by 3? For example, two non-zero \u2192 2*3=6. One non-zero \u21921*3=3. But in the third input row's third pair (0,3), which has one non-zero, the output is 6. So that doesn't fit. Alternatively, maybe if either element is non-zero, then 3 per element. Wait, 0 and3: sum is 3 \u2192 3*2=6? Wait, but that's adding the sum and multiplying by 2? Not sure.\n\nWait example 0's first output is [6,6,0]. Let's see the input pairs:\n\nFirst pair 4,4 \u2192 sum 8. If 8 is divided by 1.333, that gives 6. But that's arbitrary. Alternatively, maybe each non-zero element in the pair contributes 3. So two non-zero elements \u2192 2*3=6. One non-zero \u2192 1*3=3. But in example 0's third input row, the third pair is 0 and3. One non-zero, so should be 3. But the output is 6. So that's conflicting.\n\nWait, maybe there's a different approach. Let's check other examples.\n\nExample 1:\n\nInput:\n\n[4,0,4,3,3,0]\n[4,0,0,3,0,0]\n[0,0,4,3,0,0]\n\nOutput:\n\n[6,6,6]\n[6,0,0]\n[6,0,6]\n\nLooking at first input row [4,0,4,3,3,0]. Split into (4,0), (4,3), (3,0). Output is 6,6,6. Let's check each pair:\n\n4,0: one non-zero. So 1*3=3, but output is 6. Hmm. So that doesn't fit. \n\nAlternatively, maybe if either of the two elements is non-zero, the output is 3, but if both are non-zero, it's 6. Let's test this.\n\nFirst pair (4,0): one non-zero \u21923. But output is 6. So that's wrong.\n\nAnother idea: For each pair, if both numbers are non-zero, add their sum and then maybe do something. For example 0's first pair 4+4=8, which is 6 in output. 8 mod 7? 8-2=6. Not sure. Maybe sum divided by something. 8/ (4/3) )=6. Hmm, but that seems arbitrary.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the sum of each pair is converted to 6 if the sum is >=4. For example, 4+4=8 \u21926. 0+3=3 \u2192 maybe 3 becomes 3, but in example 0 the output is 6. So that doesn't work.\n\nWait, maybe the output for each pair is 6 if the sum of the pair is non-zero, otherwise 0. But in example 0's first output row, the third pair sum is 3+0=3, but output is 0. That contradicts.\n\nLooking at example 1's output first row: [6,6,6]. All three pairs in the input row sum to non-zero. But the output is 6 for each. So perhaps whenever the pair has a non-zero sum, replace with 6. But in example 0's first row, third pair sum is 3, which is non-zero, but output is 0. So that's not it.\n\nHmm. Let's try a different approach. Maybe the output is formed by combining two elements from the input, but perhaps adding them and then capping at 6. But 4+4=8, but output is 6. So maybe any sum over 6 is capped at 6. But then 3+3=6, which would be 6. Let's check example 0's first row. Third pair 3+0=3. But output is 0. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternative idea: For each pair, if both elements are non-zero, output 6. If only one is non-zero, output 3. If both zero, 0. Let's test this.\n\nExample 0's first input row:\n\n[4,4,0,3,3,0]. Pairs:\n\n(4,4): both non-zero \u21926. (0,3): one non-zero \u21923. (3,0): one non-zero \u21923. But the output is [6,6,0]. So according to this logic, the output should be [6,3,3], which doesn't match. So this can't be right.\n\nBut wait in example 0's output, the third element is 0. How? Let's check the third pair in the first input row: 3 and 0. If one is non-zero, the output should be 3. But in the example it's 0. So that's conflicting.\n\nHmm. Maybe the pattern is different. Let's look for another angle.\n\nLooking at the output rows. Each output row has three elements, and each input row has six elements. So perhaps each output element is derived from two adjacent elements in the input. For example, the first output element in a row is derived from the first two elements of the input row, the second from the next two, and the third from the last two. That makes sense. So each pair of two elements in the input becomes one element in the output.\n\nNow, how to transform those two elements into the output.\n\nIn example 0:\n\nInput row 0: [4,4,0,3,3,0]\n\nPairs: (4,4), (0,3), (3,0). Output is [6,6,0].\n\nSo how do (4,4) become 6, (0,3) become 6, and (3,0) become 0.\n\nHmm. Let's see. For (4,4), maybe adding them gives 8. But output is 6. So 8-2=6. Not sure. Or 4+4=8, then modulo 6 is 2. But output is 6. Doesn't fit.\n\nWait, maybe the sum of the two elements, but if the sum is even, use 6, else 3? 4+4=8 even \u21926. 0+3=3 odd \u21923. But output is 6 here, so that's not.\n\nAlternatively, the sum divided by something. 8 divided by (8/6) = 6. But that's arbitrary.\n\nWait, let's check another example. Example 1's input row 0:\n\n[4,0,4,3,3,0]. Pairs: (4,0), (4,3), (3,0). Output is 6,6,6.\n\nSum for (4,0)=4 \u2192 output 6. (4,3)=7 \u21926. (3,0)=3 \u21926. So how do 4,7,3 become 6 each?\n\nThis seems inconsistent. Maybe the output is 6 whenever at least one element in the pair is non-zero, otherwise 0. But in example 0's first row third pair (3,0) is non-zero sum, but output is 0, which contradicts.\n\nWait, looking at example 0's output third element is 0. The input pair is (3,0). So sum is 3. Maybe if the sum is 3, output 6. But in example 0's third pair sum is 3, but output is 0. So that's conflicting.\n\nAlternative approach: Maybe the output is 6 for each pair that has both elements non-zero. Otherwise, 3 if one is non-zero, 0 if both are zero. Let's test this.\n\nExample 0's first input row:\n\n(4,4): both non-zero \u21926. (0,3): one non-zero \u21923. (3,0): one non-zero \u21923. Output is [6,6,0]. But according to this logic, the output should be [6,3,3], which doesn't match. So that's not it.\n\nBut in the actual output, the second element is 6. So maybe there's a different rule here.\n\nWait, maybe the count of non-zero elements in the entire row? Or something else. Let's look at example 0's input. The first row has 4,4,0,3,3,0. So three pairs: (4,4), (0,3), (3,0). The output is [6,6,0]. So why the third pair gives 0. The third pair has sum 3+0=3. So maybe if the sum is exactly 3, then 6, but in the output it's 0. So that's not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe if the pair has a 3 and a 0, output 6. But in example 0's third pair (3,0) outputs 0. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps the output is 6 for each pair that contains a 3. Let's check:\n\nExample 0's first input row:\n\nSecond pair (0,3) \u21923 is present \u21926. Third pair (3,0) \u21923 present \u21926. But output is 6,6,0. Third element is 0, so that's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is 6 for pairs where the two numbers are the same. Let's see:\n\nIn example 0's first input row, (4,4) \u2192 same \u21926. (0,3) \u2192 not same. (3,0) \u2192 not same. But output is [6,6,0]. So second pair (0,3) is not same but output is 6. So that doesn't fit.\n\nHmm, this is tricky. Let's try looking at another example. Example 1's output:\n\n[6,6,6]\n\nInput pairs for the first row are (4,0), (4,3), (3,0). How do these become 6 each? Maybe the sum of each pair is 4, 7, 3. But how does that convert to 6?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the presence of a 3 in the pair. Let's check:\n\nIn example 1's first input row, the pairs (4,0) \u2192 no 3, (4,3) \u2192 has 3, (3,0) \u2192 has 3. But the output is all 6. So why would (4,0) give 6 here?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is 6 if the sum of the pair is a multiple of 3. Let's see:\n\nFor example 0's first pair sum 8 \u2192 8 is not multiple of 3. But output is 6. So that's not.\n\nWait, maybe the sum of each pair is divided by 3, multiplied by 6? For example, 8/3 is approx 2.666, multiplied by 6 \u2192 16. Doesn't fit.\n\nAlternative idea: Perhaps each input row is split into three groups of two numbers. For each group, if the sum of the two numbers is even, output 6; if odd, output 3. But let's test.\n\nExample 0's first row:\n\nSum of (4+4)=8 (even) \u21926. (0+3)=3 (odd) \u21923. (3+0)=3 (odd) \u21923. Output is [6,6,0]. Doesn't match.\n\nAnother angle: Looking at the test input and output examples, maybe the output is generated by counting the number of non-zero elements in each pair and then multiplying by 3. For example:\n\nIf a pair has two non-zero elements \u2192 2*3=6.\n\nIf one \u21921*3=3.\n\nIf none \u21920.\n\nBut let's check example 0's first row:\n\n(4,4) \u2192 two non-zero \u21926. (0,3) \u2192 one \u21923. (3,0) \u2192 one \u21923. Output is [6,6,0]. So the third pair in the output is 0, but according to this logic, it should be 3. So that doesn't fit.\n\nWait, but in example 0's third pair (3,0), maybe if the sum is 3, then 0? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is 6 for each pair where both elements are non-zero and equal. For example 0's first pair (4,4) \u21926. Second pair (0,3) \u2192 not equal \u21920. Third pair (3,0) \u21920. But output is [6,6,0]. So the second pair gives 6. So that's conflicting.\n\nHmm. Let's look at example 3:\n\nInput row 0: [4,4,0,3,0,0]\n\nPairs: (4,4), (0,3), (0,0). Output is [6,6,0].\n\nSo (4,4) \u21926, (0,3) \u21926, (0,0) \u21920. How?\n\nMaybe if the sum is >=4, output 6. Let's see:\n\n(4+4)=8 \u21926. (0+3)=3 \u21923 is less than 4, but output is 6. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAnother thought: Maybe the output is 6 for each pair that has a 4 and a 4, or a 3 and a 3, etc. But in example 0's second pair (0,3), there's a 3, but the output is 6. So maybe whenever there's a 3 in the pair, it's 6. But then (0,3) would be 6, (3,0) also 6. But in example 0's first row output, third element is 0. So that's conflicting.\n\nWait, example 0's third pair is (3,0). The output is 0. But why? Hmm.\n\nLet me check example 2's input and output.\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput row 0: [0,0,4,0,3,0]\n\nPairs: (0,0), (4,0), (3,0). Output is [0,6,6].\n\nWait, according to this, (4,0) gives 6, (3,0) gives 6. But how?\n\nIf the presence of a 4 or 3 in the pair gives 6. So (4,0) has a 4 \u21926. (3,0) has a 3 \u21926. (0,0) \u21920. So output [0,6,6]. That fits. Let's check example 0's third pair (3,0) \u2192 has a 3 \u21926. But in example 0's output, third element is 0. That contradicts. So this can't be the rule.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is 6 if the pair contains a 3 or a 4. So any pair with 3 or 4 (regardless of other element) \u21926. So:\n\nIn example 0's first input row pairs: (4,4) \u2192 yes, (0,3) \u2192 yes, (3,0) \u2192 yes. But the output is [6,6,0]. So third pair (3,0) should be 6, but output is 0. So again conflicting.\n\nThis is confusing. Let me think of another approach. Maybe the output is the sum of the digits, but with some rule. Like, if the pair has a 4 and 4, sum is 8, which becomes 6. But how?\n\nWait, maybe each 4 is treated as contributing 3, and each 3 as contributing 3. So for example, a pair (4,4) \u21923+3=6. (0,3) \u21920+3=3. But example 0's output for the second pair is 6. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each non-zero element in the pair is counted as 3, and summed. So (4,4) \u21923+3=6. (0,3) \u21920+3=3. (3,0) \u21923+0=3. But example 0's output has the second element as 6. So this doesn't fit.\n\nBut example 0's second pair in the input is (0,3). Output for that pair is 6. So according to this idea, it should be 3. So why is it 6?\n\nHmm. Let's look at example 1's output again. Output is [6,6,6]. The input pairs are (4,0), (4,3), (3,0). If each non-zero element is 3, then:\n\n(4,0) \u21923+0=3 \u2192 output 3. But actual output is 6. So this doesn't work.\n\nAlternative approach: Maybe the output for each pair is the sum of the digits multiplied by 1.5, but rounded. 4+4=8 \u2192 8*1.5=12 \u2192 no, but output is 6. Doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is 6 if there's at least one non-zero element in the pair, and 0 otherwise. So any pair with at least one non-zero becomes 6. But example 0's third pair (3,0) is non-zero, but output is 0. So that can't be.\n\nWait, in example 0's third row input: [0,0,0,0,0,3]. Split into (0,0), (0,0), (0,3). Output is [0,0,6]. So third pair (0,3) \u21926. So according to this, any pair with at least one non-zero \u21926. But then why in example 0's first row third pair (3,0) the output is 0? That's conflicting.\n\nThis is really challenging. Let's try to find a different angle. Maybe the output is related to the input in a different way, not just pairs. For instance, the output could be the sum of each column in the input matrix. But the input has three rows and six columns. Output has three rows and three columns, so maybe the columns are combined.\n\nWait, the input for each example has three rows, each with six elements. The output has three rows, each with three elements. So perhaps the input is transformed by combining columns in some way.\n\nFor example, columns 0 and 1 from the input might form the first element of the output, columns 2 and 3 form the second, and 4 and 5 form the third. But that's similar to the pair approach. Let's check example 0.\n\nInput rows (three rows):\n\nRow 0: [4,4,0,3,3,0]\n\nRow 1: [4,0,0,3,0,0]\n\nRow 2: [0,0,0,0,0,3]\n\nOutput rows:\n\n[6,6,0]\n\n[6,0,0]\n\n[0,0,6]\n\nSo for output row 0, first element is 6. Let's see how that's derived from the input columns 0 and 1 across all rows.\n\nInput column 0: 4,4,0.\n\nInput column 1:4,0,0.\n\nBut how do these combine to 6 in the first element of the output row 0.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each output element is the sum of all the elements in the corresponding two columns across all rows. For example, first output element in row 0 is sum of columns 0 and 1 in row 0. 4+4=8. 8 mod something gives 6. But 8-2=6. Not sure.\n\nBut in example 0's output row 0, first element is 6. Input row 0's first two elements sum to 8. So how does 8 become 6?\n\nAlternatively, sum of the two elements divided by something. 8/(4/3) =6. But that's arbitrary.\n\nAlternatively, sum the elements in each pair, and if any of the elements in the pair is 3 or 4, then 6. Otherwise, sum. But not sure.\n\nAnother idea: Maybe the output is 6 for each pair where the sum is a multiple of 3. For example, 4+4=8 \u21928 mod 3=2 \u2192 no. But output is 6. So that's not.\n\nAlternatively, the sum of the two elements in the pair is mapped to 6 if they are non-zero. For example, any non-zero sum becomes 6. So (4,4) \u21926, (0,3) \u21923 sum \u21926, (3,0) \u21923 sum \u21926. But in example 0's output third element is 0, which conflicts.\n\nWait, looking back at example 0's input row 0 third pair (3,0) sum is 3. Output is 0. Why? Maybe there's another rule here.\n\nPerhaps the output is 6 if the pair contains a 3 and a 3. For example, in example 0's input row 0, the third pair is 3 and 0. So no, output is 0. But in example 1's input row 0, third pair is 3 and 0, output is 6. So that's conflicting.\n\nThis is getting too confusing. Let's try to see if there's a different pattern. Maybe each input row is transformed by adding pairs and then replacing the sum with 6 if it's even, and 0 if it's odd.\n\nWait, example 0's first row pairs:\n\n4+4=8 (even) \u21926.\n\n0+3=3 (odd) \u21920.\n\n3+0=3 (odd) \u21920.\n\nBut output is [6,6,0]. So the second pair sum is 3 (odd), but output is 6. So that's not.\n\nAlternative idea: For each pair, if the sum is 6 or higher, output 6. Otherwise, output 0. Let's test:\n\nExample 0's first pair sum is 8 \u21926. Second pair sum 3 \u21920. Third pair sum 3 \u21920. Output would be [6,0,0], but actual output is [6,6,0]. So no.\n\nAnother possibility: The output is the count of the numbers 3 and 4 in each pair multiplied by 3. For example, a pair with two 4s \u21922*3=6. A pair with one 3 \u21921*3=3. But example 0's first pair (4,4) \u21926. Second pair (0,3) \u21923. Third pair (3,0) \u21923. Output is [6,6,0]. So the second pair in output is 6, but according to this, it's 3. So not matching.\n\nAlternatively, the output is 6 for each occurrence of a 3 or 4 in the pair, but summed. For example, each 3 or 4 in the pair contributes 3. So (4,4) \u21926, (0,3) \u21923, (3,0) \u21923. But example 0's output is [6,6,0]. So the second pair gives 6 here. So that's not.\n\nLet me think of another approach. Maybe the output is 6 for each pair where the two numbers add up to an even number, and 0 if odd. But in example 0's first pair sum is even (8 \u21926), second pair sum is odd (3 \u21920), third sum is odd (3 \u21920). Output is [6,6,0]. So second pair output is 6, which contradicts.\n\nAnother thought: Maybe the output is 6 if the pair contains two non-zero numbers, 3 if only one, and 0 if none. For example 0's first pair (4,4) \u21926. Second pair (0,3) \u21923. Third pair (3,0) \u21923. Output is [6,6,0]. So this doesn't fit. But why the third pair in the output is 0?\n\nAlternatively, maybe if the pair contains a 3 and a 0, the output is 6. But in example 0's third pair (3,0), output is 0. So that's conflicting.\n\nI'm stuck. Let's try to look at multiple examples at once to see if there's a common pattern.\n\nExample 0 input row 0:\n\n[4,4,0,3,3,0] \u2192 output [6,6,0]\n\nExample 1 input row 0:\n\n[4,0,4,3,3,0] \u2192 output [6,6,6]\n\nExample 2 input row 0:\n\n[0,0,4,0,3,0] \u2192 output [0,6,6]\n\nExample 3 input row 0:\n\n[4,4,0,3,0,0] \u2192 output [6,6,0]\n\nExample 4 input row 0:\n\n[0,0,0,0,3,0] \u2192 output [0,6,0]\n\nLooking at the output elements:\n\nIn example 0 row 0 output [6,6,0], the input pairs are (4,4), (0,3), (3,0).\n\nIn example 1 row 0 output [6,6,6], pairs are (4,0), (4,3), (3,0).\n\nIn example 2 row 0 output [0,6,6], pairs are (0,0), (4,0), (3,0).\n\nHmm. Not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps the output is 6 for each pair where the two elements are both non-zero and the same. For example:\n\nExample 0 row 0 pair (4,4) \u21926. Pair (0,3) \u2192 not same \u21920. But output is 6 here. So that's not.\n\nAlternatively, if the two elements in the pair are the same, output 6. If one is 3 and the other is 0, output 6. Otherwise, 0. Let's test:\n\nExample 0 row 0:\n\n(4,4) \u21926. (0,3) \u21923 and 0 \u21926. (3,0) \u21923 and 0 \u21926. Output is [6,6,0]. But third pair in output is 0. So that's conflicting.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps when the two elements in the pair sum to 6, output 6. Otherwise, 0. For example 0's first pair sum is 8 \u21920. But output is 6. No.\n\nThis is really challenging. Let's try to think of the outputs as possibly being a transformation of the input where each pair is transformed based on their elements.\n\nAnother idea: Perhaps each pair is considered as coordinates in a grid, and the output is 6 if they form a certain pattern. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is 6 for each pair where the elements are either both 4s, both 3s, or one 4 and one 3. Let's see.\n\nExample 0's first pair (4,4) \u21926. Second pair (0,3) \u21920 and 3 \u2192 no. But output is 6. So no.\n\nWait, example 0's second pair (0,3): output is 6. How? Maybe if the pair has a 3, output 6. So any pair containing a 3 gives 6. But then in example 0's third pair (3,0) \u21926, but output is 0. So that's conflicting.\n\nAlternatively, the output is 6 if the pair contains a 4 or a 3, and 0 otherwise. So pairs with any 4 or 3 become 6. Let's test:\n\nExample 0's first pair (4,4) \u21926. Second pair (0,3) \u21926. Third pair (3,0) \u21926. Output is [6,6,0]. But actual output is [6,6,0]. So third element is 0. So this doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. Let's look at the test input and see if we can find a pattern that works for the examples and then apply it.\n\nTest input:\n\n[0,4,4,3,0,0]\n\n[4,0,0,3,3,0]\n\n[0,4,0,3,0,0]\n\nAssuming the output is three rows of three elements each. Let's split each row into pairs.\n\nRow 0: (0,4), (4,3), (0,0)\n\nRow 1: (4,0), (0,3), (3,0)\n\nRow 2: (0,4), (0,3), (0,0)\n\nIf the pattern is to replace each pair with 6 if there's a 3 or 4 present, but that's not working for previous examples. Alternatively, each pair where the sum is non-zero is 6. So:\n\nRow 0 pairs sum:4,7,0 \u2192 [6,6,0]\n\nRow 1 pairs sum:4,3,3 \u2192 [6,6,6]\n\nRow 2 pairs sum:4,3,0 \u2192 [6,6,0]\n\nBut according to this, the output would be:\n\n[6,6,0]\n\n[6,6,6]\n\n[6,6,0]\n\nBut looking at the training examples, this may not fit. For example, in example 0's third pair sum is 3, output is 0. But according to this rule, sum non-zero \u21926. So why in example 0's third pair, the output is 0.\n\nBut wait, maybe the output is 6 for each pair where the sum is a multiple of 3, otherwise 0. Let's test:\n\nExample 0's first pair sum 8 \u2192 not multiple of 3 \u21920. But output is 6. So no.\n\nThis is getting me nowhere. Let's try to find another approach. Maybe the output is the result of some bitwise operation, but that seems unlikely.\n\nWait, looking at example 0's output:\n\n[6,6,0]\n\n[6,0,0]\n\n[0,0,6]\n\nThe output has 6s where certain conditions are met. Let's see:\n\nIn the first input row, pairs are (4,4), (0,3), (3,0). Output is 6,6,0.\n\nIn the output, the third element is 0. Maybe because the pair (3,0) sums to 3, which is the only case when it's 0. But in example 1's third pair (3,0) outputs 6.\n\nAlternatively, maybe if the pair has a 3 and a 0, output 0. But example 1's third pair (3,0) outputs 6. So that's conflicting.\n\nAnother idea: Maybe the output is 6 for each pair where the numbers are in the same position (like both first elements) across the three rows. Not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps the output is formed by looking at columns across all three input rows and combining them. For example, each output element is derived from two columns in the input. For instance, output row 0, column 0 is derived from input columns 0 and 1 across all three rows.\n\nBut that seems complex. Let's try example 0:\n\nInput columns 0 and 1 across all three rows:\n\nRow 0:4,4\n\nRow 1:4,0\n\nRow 2:0,0\n\nIf we sum all these numbers:4+4+4+0+0+0=12. 12/2=6. So output row 0, column 0 is 6. That fits.\n\nSimilarly, columns 2 and 3:\n\nRow 0:0,3 \u2192 sum 3\n\nRow 1:0,3 \u2192 sum 3\n\nRow 2:0,0 \u2192 sum 0\n\nTotal sum:3+3+0=6. 6/1=6. So output row 0, column 1 is 6. That fits.\n\nColumns 4 and 5:\n\nRow 0:3,0 \u2192 sum3\n\nRow 1:0,0 \u2192 sum0\n\nRow 2:0,3 \u2192 sum3\n\nTotal sum3+0+3=6. 6/1=6. But output row 0, column 2 is 0. So this doesn't fit.\n\nHmm, but why is the third output element 0 in example 0's first row.\n\nAlternative idea: For each pair of columns (e.g., columns 0-1, 2-3, 4-5), sum across all three rows and then divide by the number of non-zero sums. For example:\n\nExample 0's columns 0-1:\n\nSum for each row: (4+4=8), (4+0=4), (0+0=0). Summing these:8+4+0=12. 12/2=6. Output is 6.\n\nColumns 2-3:\n\nRow sums:0+3=3, 0+3=3, 0+0=0. Total sum 6. 6/2=3. But output is 6. So no.\n\nThis isn't working. Maybe I need to abandon this approach.\n\nLet me look for another pattern. Looking at example 0's output:\n\nThe output rows have 6s where the input rows have non-zero pairs, but not sure. Alternatively, maybe each output element is the number of times a certain condition is met across the corresponding pairs in all three input rows.\n\nFor example, output element [0][0] is 6. Looking at the three input rows' first pairs:\n\nRow 0: (4,4) \u2192 sum 8.\n\nRow 1: (4,0) \u2192 sum4.\n\nRow 2: (0,0) \u2192 sum0.\n\nIf the output is the count of pairs that have a sum greater than zero multiplied by 2. For example, two pairs (row 0 and row1) have sum>0 \u21922*3=6. That fits. Then output element [0][0] is 6.\n\nOutput element [0][1] is 6. For columns 2-3 across all rows:\n\nRow0:0+3=3 \u2192>0.\n\nRow1:0+3=3 \u2192>0.\n\nRow2:0+0=0 \u2192=0.\n\nSo two pairs sum>0 \u21922*3=6. Which matches output 6.\n\nOutput element [0][2] is 0. For columns 4-5:\n\nRow0:3+0=3 \u2192>0.\n\nRow1:0+0=0 \u2192=0.\n\nRow2:0+3=3 \u2192>0.\n\nTwo pairs sum>0 \u21922*3=6. But output is 0. So this doesn't fit.\n\nSo this theory is invalid.\n\nBut why in example 0's output, the third element is 0. Let me check all pairs for columns 4-5 in example 0.\n\nInput pairs for columns 4-5:\n\nRow0:3,0 \u2192 sum3.\n\nRow1:0,0 \u2192 sum0.\n\nRow2:0,3 \u2192 sum3.\n\nSo two pairs have sum>0. According to the previous theory, output would be 6. But the actual output is 0. So this is conflicting.\n\nThis suggests that the pattern isn't based on counting.\n\nAnother idea: For each output element, it's 6 if the corresponding pairs in all three input rows have a non-zero sum. Otherwise, 0. For example, output element [0][0] corresponds to pairs (4,4), (4,0), (0,0) in the three input rows. Their sums are 8,4,0. So not all non-zero. So output would be 0. But in example 0, the output is 6. So that's not.\n\nAlternatively, output element is 6 if any of the three input pairs in that position has a non-zero sum. For example, in columns 0-1 of example 0, two pairs have non-zero sums. So output would be 6. That fits. But in columns 4-5, two pairs have non-zero sums. Output is 0. So conflicting.\n\nI'm really stuck here. Maybe I need to look for a different pattern. Let's think about the numbers 6 and 3. 6 is 3*2. 3 is a common factor. Maybe each pair contributes 3 per non-zero element, but with some rule.\n\nAlternatively, each output element is the sum of the corresponding two elements in the input row multiplied by 1.5, rounded down. For example:\n\nIn example 0's first pair 4+4=8 \u21928*1.5=12 \u219212/2=6. But how does that fit. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, if the pair contains a 3 and a 4, output is 6. But example 0's second pair is 0 and 3 \u2192 output 6. So that's not.\n\nWait, maybe the output is 6 whenever there's a 3 or 4 in the pair, regardless of the other element. So any pair containing 3 or 4 becomes 6.\n\nLet's test:\n\nExample 0's first pair (4,4) \u21926. Second pair (0,3) \u21926. Third pair (3,0) \u21926. Output is [6,6,6], but actual output is [6,6,0]. So no.\n\nExample 0's output third element is 0, but the pair (3,0) contains a 3. So this theory is wrong.\n\nHmm. Maybe the output is 6 for each pair that contains a 3 or 4, but only if the other element is non-zero. So (4,4) \u2192 yes. (0,3) \u2192 other is 0 \u2192 no. (3,0) \u2192 other is 0 \u2192 no. So output would be [6,0,0]. But example 0's output is [6,6,0]. So this doesn't fit.\n\nI'm really stuck. Let's look at the test input and try to guess the output based on the training examples, even without understanding the pattern.\n\nTest input:\n\nRow0: [0,4,4,3,0,0] \u2192 pairs (0,4), (4,3), (0,0)\n\nRow1: [4,0,0,3,3,0] \u2192 pairs (4,0), (0,3), (3,0)\n\nRow2: [0,4,0,3,0,0] \u2192 pairs (0,4), (0,3), (0,0)\n\nLooking at other examples, when a pair has a 4 and a 3, like in example 1's row0 pair (4,3), the output is 6. So perhaps any pair with a 4 or a 3 (but not sure why sometimes it's 6 and sometimes 0). For the test input:\n\nRow0 pairs:\n\n(0,4) \u2192 has 4 \u21926.\n\n(4,3) \u2192 has 4 and 3 \u21926.\n\n(0,0) \u21920.\n\nSo row0 output: [6,6,0].\n\nRow1 pairs:\n\n(4,0) \u21924 \u21926.\n\n(0,3) \u21923 \u21926.\n\n(3,0) \u21923 \u21926.\n\nSo row1 output: [6,6,6].\n\nRow2 pairs:\n\n(0,4) \u21924 \u21926.\n\n(0,3) \u21923 \u21926.\n\n(0,0) \u21920.\n\nRow2 output: [6,6,0].\n\nBut looking at the training examples, this may not fit. For example, example 0's third pair (3,0) gives output 0. So why in the test input row1's third pair (3,0) would output 6?\n\nThis inconsistency makes me think that maybe the output is generated by summing the occurrences of 3s and 4s across all three input rows for each pair position. For example, for each of the three pair positions (0-1, 2-3, 4-5), count how many times a 3 or 4 appears in any of the three rows for that pair, then multiply by 3. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe for each pair position (e.g., first pair of each row), if any of the pairs in that position across the three input rows has a certain property, output 6.\n\nBut I'm not making progress. Given the time I've spent, I'll have to make an educated guess based on the training examples.\n\nLooking at the test input:\n\nRow0 pairs: (0,4), (4,3), (0,0)\n\nRow1 pairs: (4,0), (0,3), (3,0)\n\nRow2 pairs: (0,4), (0,3), (0,0)\n\nI notice that in many training examples, whenever a pair contains a 4 and a 3, or two 4s, or two 3s, the output is 6. But when the pair has a single 3 or 4 and a zero, sometimes it's 6 and sometimes 0.\n\nIn example 0's first row, (0,3) outputs 6. In example 1's first row, (4,0) outputs 6. In example 3's first row, (0,3) outputs 6. So perhaps the presence of a 3 or 4 in the pair results in 6, regardless of the other element. So even if it's paired with a 0.\n\nIn example 0's third pair (3,0), the output is 0. But in example 1's third pair (3,0), the output is 6. So this is conflicting. But perhaps the position in the row matters. For example, maybe in certain positions, even if there's a 3 or 4, it's 0.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is 6 for any pair that has a 4 or 3 in it, except when the pair is in the third position of the row and has a 3. But this seems arbitrary.\n\nGiven the confusion, I'll proceed with the assumption that any pair containing a 3 or 4 results in 6, and 0 otherwise. Let's apply this to the test input:\n\nRow0 pairs:\n\n(0,4) \u21924 \u21926.\n\n(4,3) \u21924 and 3 \u21926.\n\n(0,0) \u21920.\n\nSo output row0: [6,6,0].\n\nRow1 pairs:\n\n(4,0) \u21924 \u21926.\n\n(0,3) \u21923 \u21926.\n\n(3,0) \u21923 \u21926.\n\nOutput row1: [6,6,6].\n\nRow2 pairs:\n\n(0,4) \u21924 \u21926.\n\n(0,3) \u21923 \u21926.\n\n(0,0) \u21920.\n\nOutput row2: [6,6,0].\n\nBut looking at example 0's third pair (3,0) \u2192 output 0. So this contradicts. But in example 1's third pair (3,0) \u2192 output 6. So the pattern isn't consistent.\n\nAnother possibility: Maybe the output is 6 if the pair contains a 4 and a 4, or a 3 and a 3. If one element is 4 or 3 and the other is zero, then 3. Otherwise, 0. But how does that fit.\n\nTest input row0's first pair (0,4): one 4 \u21923. But according to this, output would be 3. But according to training examples, perhaps it's 6.\n\nI'm really stuck. Given the time I've spent, I'll go with the initial assumption that pairs with any 3 or 4 become 6, and others 0. So the test output would be:\n\n[6,6,0]\n\n[6,6,6]\n\n[6,6,0]\n\nBut checking against the training examples:\n\nExample 0's third pair (3,0) would be 6, but output is 0. So this is conflicting.\n\nBut perhaps there's another layer. Maybe the output is 6 if the pair contains a 3 or 4 in all three input rows for that position. Let's check:\n\nFor test input's first pair position across all three rows:\n\nRow0:0,4 \u21924 present.\n\nRow1:4,0 \u21924 present.\n\nRow2:0,4 \u21924 present.\n\nSo all three pairs have 4. Output first element would be 6.\n\nSecond pair position:\n\nRow0:4,3 \u21924 and3.\n\nRow1:0,3 \u21923.\n\nRow2:0,3 \u21923.\n\nSo all pairs have 3 or 4. Output second element 6.\n\nThird pair position:\n\nRow0:0,0 \u2192 no.\n\nRow1:3,0 \u21923.\n\nRow2:0,0 \u2192 no.\n\nSo only one pair has a 3. Output third element could be 6 multiplied by the number of pairs with 3/4, but this is speculative.\n\nBut in example 0's third pair position across rows:\n\nRow0:3,0 \u21923.\n\nRow1:0,0 \u2192no.\n\nRow2:0,3 \u21923.\n\nSo two pairs have 3. Output third element is 6. But in example 0's output, third element of row0 is 0. So this theory doesn't fit.\n\nI'm out of ideas. Given that I need to provide an answer, I'll proceed with the initial pattern observed in some examples, even if conflicting. The test input's output would be:\n\n[6,6,0]\n\n[6,6,6]\n\n[6,6,0]\n\nBut looking at example 2's input and output, which has [0,0,4,0,3,0] in row0, output is [0,6,6]. According to this, the first pair (0,0) \u21920, second (4,0) \u21926, third (3,0) \u21926. Which aligns with the idea that any pair with 3 or 4 becomes 6. So maybe the pattern is: for each pair in the input row, if there's a 3 or a 4 present, output 6, else 0.\n\nIn example 0's third pair (3,0) has a 3 \u21926. But the output is 0. So this theory is incorrect. But perhaps there's another condition. Maybe the pair must have at least one 3 or 4, and the sum is non-zero. But that doesn't help.\n\nAlternatively, if the pair contains a 3, output 6; if it contains a 4, output 6. Unless there's a 3 and a 0, then output 0. But example 0's third pair (3,0) outputs 0. Example 1's third pair (3,0) outputs 6. So that's conflicting.\n\nThis is really confusing. Given the time constraints, I'll proceed with the following output for the test input:\n\n[6,6,0]\n\n[6,6,6]\n\n[6,6,0]\n\nBut looking at example 2's output, which has [0,6,6] for the first row. The input pairs are (0,0), (4,0), (3,0). According to the theory, each pair with a 4 or 3 would output 6. So second pair (4,0) \u21926, third pair (3,0) \u21926. So output [0,6,6], but according to the theory, first pair (0,0) \u21920. Which matches. So this theory holds for example 2.\n\nBut example 0's first row third pair (3,0) should output 6, but the actual output is 0. So this is conflicting. Unless there's an exception when a 3 is paired with a 0. But why?\n\nIn example 0's input row0's third pair is (3,0). Output is 0. In example 1's input row0's third pair is (3,0), output is 6. So why the difference?\n\nLooking at example 0's input row0's third pair (3,0) and output 0:\n\nIs there something else in the input that affects this? Maybe the other rows. For example, in example 0, the third row has [0,0,0,0,0,3], which splits into (0,0), (0,0), (0,3). Output third row is [0,0,6]. So the third pair in that row is (0,3), which outputs 6. \n\nSo in the output for example 0's first row third pair is 0, but third row third pair is 6. So the same pair (3,0) in first row outputs 0, but (0,3) in third row outputs 6. So the position in the row matters.\n\nThis suggests that the output is determined by the individual row's pairs, not the entire matrix. So maybe the rule is: for each pair in a row, if the sum is non-zero and divisible by 3, output 6. Otherwise, 0. Let's test:\n\nExample 0 row0 third pair sum 3+0=3 \u2192 divisible by 3 \u21926. But output is 0. So no.\n\nAlternatively, if the pair contains a 3, output 6 if it's in the second or third pair of the row. But this is arbitrary.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and the need to provide an answer, I'll proceed with the following output for the test input, based on the assumption that any pair containing a 3 or 4 outputs 6:\n\n[6,6,0]\n\n[6,6,6]\n\n[6,6,0]\n\nBut I'm not confident. Looking back at the training examples, this would match example 1 and 2, but example 0's output would be different. However, given the test input, this seems plausible."

        "cot_1": "Okay, let's tackle this puzzle. The task is to figure out the transformation pattern from the input to the output in the training examples and then apply it to the test input. \n\nFirst, I'll look at the training examples to identify any patterns. Let's start with Example 0.\n\n**Example 0 Input:**\nThree rows:\n- [4, 4, 0, 3, 3, 0]\n- [4, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0]\n- [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3]\n\n**Output:**\nThree rows:\n- [6, 6, 0]\n- [6, 0, 0]\n- [0, 0, 6]\n\nLooking at the input, each row has 6 elements, and the output has 3 elements. So the input is being split or combined into pairs. Let's see if adding pairs makes sense. \n\nFor the first input row: 4+4=8, 0+3=3, 3+0=3. But the output is [6,6,0]. Hmm, that doesn't add up. Wait, maybe it's grouping every two elements and summing them, but there's something else. Let me check the outputs again.\n\nWait, in the first output row of Example 0, the first element is 6. The input's first two elements are 4 and 4. 4+4=8, not 6. So maybe it's not a simple sum. Alternatively, maybe replacing 4 and 3 with different numbers. Let's check other examples.\n\n**Example 1 Input:**\nFirst input row: [4,0,4,3,3,0]. Output row: [6,6,6]. Let's see how that's formed. If we group into pairs (4,0), (4,3), (3,0), maybe sum them but with some transformation. 4+0=4, but output is 6. 4+3=7, but output 6. 3+0=3, but output 6. That doesn't add up. Alternatively, maybe count the number of non-zero elements in each pair and multiply by some value. Let's check.\n\nIn Example 0's first row: pairs (4,4) (0,3) (3,0). The non-zero counts are 2,1,1. If multiplied by 3, that's 6,3,3. But the output is [6,6,0]. Hmm, not matching. Maybe it's about 4s and 3s. Let's see if 4 and 3 are being converted to 6. \n\nLooking at Example 0's output first row: 6,6,0. The first pair has two 4s \u2192 6 each. The second pair has 0 and 3: maybe 3 becomes 6? But then the third pair is 3 and 0 \u2192 0. Wait, maybe 4 is converted to 6 and 3 is converted to 6 as well, but only if they are in certain positions or combinations. But in Example 0's first input row, the third element is 0 and fourth is 3. The output's second element is 6. Maybe each pair is being checked for having 4s or 3s, and converted to 6 if present. But how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 4s and 3s are treated as 3 each (since 4+3=7, but 6 is a multiple of 3). Wait, maybe each 4 is replaced by 3 and each 3 is replaced by 3, then summed. But 4's and 3's sum to 3 each. Let's see:\n\nExample 0 first input row: 4,4,0,3,3,0. If 4=3, 3=3, then each pair would be 3+3=6 (for first pair), 0+3=3 (second pair), 3+0=3 (third pair). But the output is [6,6,0]. That doesn't fit. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe each 4 is converted to 3 and each 3 is converted to 3, and then summed. So for the first pair (4,4) \u2192 3+3=6. Second pair (0,3) \u21920+3=3. Third pair (3,0) \u21923+0=3. But the output is [6,6,0]. So that doesn't fit. The output's second element is 6, but according to this, it would be 3. So this approach isn't working.\n\nLooking at another example. Example 1's input first row: [4,0,4,3,3,0]. Output is [6,6,6]. If each pair is processed:\n\nFirst pair:4,0 \u2192 maybe 4 is 3, 0 is 0. So 3+0=3 \u2192 but output is 6. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe each pair is summed, but with a max value. Like 4+0=4, but output is 6. Not sure.\n\nAlternative approach: Maybe each group of two elements in the input is converted to 6 if there's at least one 4 or 3 in the pair. But how?\n\nIn Example 0's first input row, the first pair has two 4s \u2192 6. The second pair has a 3 \u21926. Third pair has a 3 but output is 0. That doesn't fit. So maybe that's not the case.\n\nWait, let's look at the outputs. All outputs consist of 0s and 6s. So the transformation results in either 6 or 0. So perhaps each pair in the input is checked for certain conditions, and if met, the output for that pair is 6; otherwise, 0.\n\nWhat's the condition? Let's see.\n\nTake Example 0's first input row:\n\n[4,4,0,3,3,0]\n\nGrouped into three pairs: [4,4], [0,3], [3,0]\n\nOutput is [6,6,0]. So the first two pairs produce 6, the third 0. What's the difference between the pairs? \n\nFirst pair: two 4s. Second pair: 0 and 3. Third pair:3 and 0.\n\nIn Example 1's first input row:\n\n[4,0,4,3,3,0]\n\nGrouped into [4,0], [4,3], [3,0]\n\nOutput is [6,6,6]. So all three pairs become 6. Hmm. Let's see what's common in the pairs that produce 6.\n\nWait, maybe a pair contributes 6 if it contains a 4 or a 3. But in Example 0's third pair [3,0], the output is 0. So that contradicts. Unless there's a specific condition like the sum of the pair being >=3 or something.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the sum of the pair is converted to 6 if certain conditions are met. For example, sum the pair and then multiply by some factor. Let's check:\n\nExample 0 first pair: 4+4=8. Output is 6. 8 * 0.75 =6. Second pair:0+3=3. 3*2=6. Third pair:3+0=3 \u21923*2=6, but output is 0. So that's inconsistent.\n\nAnother approach: Maybe the numbers 4 and 3 in the input are being replaced by 3 each (since 4+3=7, but 6 is 2*3). Then each pair's sum is multiplied by something. Wait, 4 becomes 3, 3 stays 3. Let's try:\n\nExample 0 first input row:\n\nOriginal pairs:\n\n[4,4] \u2192 3+3=6 \u2192 output 6.\n\n[0,3] \u21920+3=3 \u2192 how to get 6? Multiply by 2 \u2192 6.\n\n[3,0] \u21923+0=3 \u2192 multiply by 2 \u21926. But the output is 0 here. So that's conflicting.\n\nHmm. Not matching.\n\nLooking at the outputs again: Each output row is three elements, each 0 or 6. So perhaps each element in the output is 6 if the corresponding input pair has at least one non-zero element, but only if certain conditions are met. For example, maybe the pair has a 4 and/or 3, but other numbers (like 0) don't contribute. Let's check.\n\nIn Example 0's first pair: two 4s \u2192 6.\n\nSecond pair:0 and 3 \u21923 is present \u21926.\n\nThird pair:3 and 0 \u21923 present. But output is 0. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pair must sum to a multiple of 3. For example, 4+4=8 (not a multiple of 3). 0+3=3 \u2192 yes. 3+0=3 \u2192 yes. But in Example 0's output, third element is 0. So this doesn't explain.\n\nAnother idea: Maybe each 4 and 3 in the input is considered a 'block' and each pair is checked for having a 4 or 3, but in a specific order. For instance, the first element of the pair is a 4 and the second is a 3, or something like that. But not sure.\n\nLooking at Example 3's input:\n\nInput row: [4,4,0,3,0,0]\n\nGrouped into pairs: [4,4], [0,3], [0,0]\n\nOutput: [6,6,0]. So first pair (4,4) \u21926, second pair (0,3) \u21926, third pair (0,0) \u21920. So perhaps any pair that contains at least one 4 or 3 becomes 6. But in Example 0's third pair (3,0), output is 0. Wait, that contradicts. Because in that case, the pair has a 3, so output should be 6, but it's 0. So that can't be.\n\nWait, let me check Example 0's third input row:\n\nOriginal input third row: [0,0,0,0,0,3]\n\nGrouped into pairs: [0,0], [0,0], [0,3]\n\nOutput is [0,0,6]. So here, the third pair (0,3) becomes 6. So maybe a pair is 6 if it contains a 3. But in Example 0's first input row, the third pair is (3,0) \u21923 present, but output is 0. That's conflicting.\n\nWait, maybe it's about the position of the 3 and 4. Let me check.\n\nAlternative approach: Maybe each input row is split into three columns, each column being two elements. Then, for each column, if the sum of 4s and 3s is present, then 6 is output. Wait, perhaps for each pair (two elements in the input row), if there are any 4s or 3s, sum them and multiply by 1.5 (since 4*1.5=6 and 3*2=6). But how?\n\nWait, 4 and 3 sum to 7. 4 is converted to 6 (4*1.5), 3 is converted to 6 (3*2). So each 4 becomes 6, each 3 becomes 6, and 0 stays 0. Then, the sum of each pair in the input is the sum of their converted values. For example, in Example 0's first pair (4,4) \u21926+6=12. But the output is 6. So perhaps the maximum of the pair's converted values. So 6 and 6 \u21926. So output 6. The second pair (0,3): 0 and 6 \u2192 max is 6. Third pair (3,0):6 and 0 \u21926. But in the output, the third element is 0. That doesn't fit. Hmm.\n\nWait, but in Example 0's third input row:\n\n[0,0,0,0,0,3]\n\nGrouped into three pairs: [0,0], [0,0], [0,3]. Converting 3 to 6. So the pairs' converted values are [0+0=0], [0+0=0], [0+6=6]. So sum would be 0,0,6. But the output is [0,0,6], which matches. But in Example 0's first input row, the third pair (3,0) \u21926+0=6. Output is 0. So that's conflicting.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the sum of the converted values in each pair is divided by the number of non-zero elements. For example, if both are non-zero, sum and divide by 2. But for Example 0's first pair (4,4) \u21926+6=12 \u219212/2=6. Which matches. Second pair (0,3) \u21926 \u21926/1=6. Third pair (3,0) \u21926/1=6, but output is 0. So that doesn't fit. So this approach is not working.\n\nLet me think differently. Let's look at all the examples again, but this time looking for possible column-wise transformations.\n\nWait, the input has three rows each with six elements. The output has three rows each with three elements. So perhaps each output element is derived from two columns across all three rows. For example, the first output element combines the first two columns of all three input rows.\n\nBut how? Let's look at Example 0's input:\n\nInput rows:\n\nRow1: [4,4,0,3,3,0]\n\nRow2: [4,0,0,3,0,0]\n\nRow3: [0,0,0,0,0,3]\n\nOutput rows:\n\n[6,6,0]\n\n[6,0,0]\n\n[0,0,6]\n\nLooking at the first element of each output row: 6,6,0. Let's see what the first two columns of the input are for each row:\n\nRow1: 4,4\n\nRow2:4,0\n\nRow3:0,0\n\nSo combining these, maybe sum all these elements: 4+4+4+0+0+0=12. Then divide by 2 (since there are 6 elements, but per output element). 12/2=6. Which matches the first output elements (6,6,0)? Wait, the first output row's first element is 6. How does that fit?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each output row's element is the sum of the corresponding two elements in the input row, but with some transformation. But earlier attempts didn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each output element is the sum of the corresponding two elements in the input row, but if the sum is 4 or 3, it's converted to 6. Let's see:\n\nExample 0 first row: [4,4,0,3,3,0]\n\nSum pairs:\n\n4+4=8 \u2192 but output is 6.\n\n0+3=3 \u2192 converted to 6.\n\n3+0=3 \u2192 converted to 6. But output is [6,6,0]. So this doesn't fit. The third sum is 3, which would convert to 6, but output is 0. So that's not right.\n\nWait, maybe the pairs are summed, and if the sum is 7 (4+3), it's converted to 6. Or other rules. For example, 4 and 4 sum to 8. How does that become 6? Maybe modulo 6? 8 mod 6 is 2, but that's not helpful.\n\nAnother angle: Looking at the outputs, all the 6s could be derived from the presence of 4s and 3s in the input pairs. Maybe each 4 and 3 in the input is counted, and each contributes 3 towards the sum, then multiplied by 2. For example, 4 and 3 are each counted as 3. So a pair with two 4s would be 3+3=6. A pair with one 3 would be 3. But output is 6. So perhaps each occurrence of 4 or 3 counts as 3, and the sum of the pair is multiplied by 2 if there's at least one 4 or 3.\n\nWait, let's take Example 0's first input pair (4,4). Each 4 counts as 3, sum is 6. Output is 6. Second pair (0,3): 3 counts as 3, sum is 3. Multiply by 2 (because there's a 3) \u21926. Third pair (3,0): sum is 3, multiply by 2 \u21926, but output is 0. Hmm, no.\n\nAlternatively, each 4 or 3 in the input pair contributes 3, and their sum is multiplied by 2 if the pair has any 4 or 3. But again, the third pair in Example 0 would sum to 3 (3 from the 3, 0 contributes nothing). Multiply by 2 gives 6, but output is 0. Doesn't fit.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Let's think of a different approach. Maybe the output rows are derived from the input rows by looking at the positions of 4s and 3s and combining them in some way. For example, each 4 in the input is replaced by a 6, and each 3 is replaced by a 6, but only in certain columns. Let's see:\n\nExample 0's first input row: [4,4,0,3,3,0]\n\nIf we replace 4 and 3 with 6, but only in pairs. So for each pair:\n\nPair 1: 4 and 4 \u2192 both become 6, sum to 12 \u2192 but output is 6. Maybe take the average? 6 and 6 average to 6. So each pair's average of converted values. Then:\n\nPair1: (6+6)/2=6 \u2192 output 6.\n\nPair2: (0+6)/2=3 \u2192 but output is 6. So no.\n\nAlternatively, the maximum of the converted pair. Pair1:6 and6 \u21926. Pair2:0 and6 \u21926. Pair3:6 and0 \u21926. But in Example 0's output, the third element is 0. So this doesn't fit.\n\nThis is getting frustrating. Let's look at another example.\n\n**Example 2 Input:**\n\n[0, 0, 4, 0, 3, 0]\n\n[0, 4, 4, 3, 0, 3]\n\n[4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 3]\n\n**Output:**\n\n[0, 6, 6]\n\n[6, 6, 6]\n\n[6, 6, 6]\n\nLooking at the first input row, grouped into pairs:\n\n[0,0], [4,0], [3,0]. Output is [0,6,6]. So each pair:\n\n0,0 \u21920 \u21920.\n\n4,0 \u21926.\n\n3,0 \u21926.\n\nSo why are the 4 and 3 leading to 6? Similarly, in the second row's pairs:\n\n[0,4], [4,3], [0,3]. Outputs are 6,6,6.\n\nIf the pair contains a 4 or 3, output 6. But in the first pair of the first input row (0,0), output is 0. But in the first input row's second pair (4,0), output is 6. Third pair (3,0) \u21926. So that would fit the idea that if the pair contains at least one 4 or 3, output 6. But in Example 0's third pair (3,0) in the first input row, the output is 0. Wait, this contradicts. Because in Example 0's first input row third pair is (3,0), which should output 6, but the output is 0. So there's something wrong with that approach.\n\nWait, let me check Example 0 again:\n\nFirst input row: [4,4,0,3,3,0]\n\nPairs: (4,4), (0,3), (3,0)\n\nOutput: [6,6,0]\n\nSo the third pair (3,0) outputs 0. But according to the previous idea, it should be 6. So there's a contradiction here. That suggests the pattern is more complex.\n\nAlternative idea: Maybe the output is 6 if the sum of the pair is exactly 7 (4+3). But in Example 0's first pair sum is 8, second pair is 3, third pair is 3. None sum to 7. But the output has 6s. So that's not it.\n\nWait, maybe the output is determined by whether the pair contains both 4 and 3. For example, if a pair has a 4 and a 3, then output 6. Otherwise, sum the pair if it's 4s or 3s. Let's see:\n\nExample 0's first pair (4,4): no 3, so sum 4+4=8. How does that become 6? Doesn't fit.\n\nExample 1's first input row: pairs (4,0), (4,3), (3,0). The pair (4,3) has both 4 and 3 \u2192 output 6. The other pairs (4,0) and (3,0) may contribute 6 each. But in Example 1's output, all three are 6. So this might fit if any pair that has at least one 4 or 3 becomes 6, but why does Example 0's third pair (3,0) output 0 then?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is 6 if the pair contains either two 4s, a 4 and a 3, or two 3s. But in Example 0's third pair, there's a 3 and a 0. So it wouldn't qualify, but then in Example 1's third pair (3,0), the output is 6, which would contradict.\n\nThis is getting too confusing. Let's try another approach.\n\nLooking at all the examples, each output row has three elements, each 0 or 6. The input rows have six elements, which are grouped into three pairs. It seems that each output element corresponds to a pair in the input. The key is to find what condition makes a pair result in 6 or 0.\n\nLet's list all pairs from the training examples and their corresponding outputs.\n\n**Example 0 Input Row 1:**\nPairs: (4,4) \u21926, (0,3) \u21926, (3,0) \u21920.\n\n**Example 0 Input Row 2:**\nPairs: (4,0) \u21926, (0,3) \u21920, (0,0) \u21920.\n\nWait, no. The input rows in Example 0 are:\n\nRow1: [4,4,0,3,3,0] \u2192 pairs (4,4), (0,3), (3,0) \u2192 output [6,6,0].\n\nRow2: [4,0,0,3,0,0] \u2192 pairs (4,0), (0,3), (0,0) \u2192 output [6,0,0].\n\nRow3: [0,0,0,0,0,3] \u2192 pairs (0,0), (0,0), (0,3) \u2192 output [0,0,6].\n\nSo for the first pair of row2 (4,0), the output is 6. For the second pair (0,3), output is 0. Third pair (0,0) \u21920.\n\nSo what's the difference between (0,3) in row1 which outputs 6 and (0,3) in row2 which outputs 0?\n\nThis suggests that the transformation is not solely based on the pair itself but also depends on other rows or columns. This complicates things.\n\nPerhaps the transformation involves looking at all three rows' pairs together. For example, each output element is the sum of the three corresponding pairs across the input rows, but only if they meet certain conditions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is determined by the vertical pairs. For example, the first element of each output row is derived from the first two elements of each input row. Let's consider the columns.\n\nIn Example 0:\n\nInput rows:\n\nRow1: 4,4,0,3,3,0\n\nRow2:4,0,0,3,0,0\n\nRow3:0,0,0,0,0,3\n\nOutput rows:\n\n[6,6,0]\n\n[6,0,0]\n\n[0,0,6]\n\nLooking at the first output element of each row:6,6,0. The corresponding input columns are:\n\nFor the first output element (each row's first pair):\n\nRow1: 4,4 \u21926.\n\nRow2:4,0 \u21926.\n\nRow3:0,0 \u21920.\n\nSo how does this come about? The output for each row's first element seems to be 6 if the pair contains at least one 4, else 0. Because Row1 has two 4s \u21926. Row2 has a 4 and 0 \u21926. Row3 has 0s \u21920.\n\nSecond output elements:\n\nRow1:6 (pair 0,3), Row2:0 (pair 0,3), Row3:0 (pair 0,0). Wait, this doesn't fit. For Row1's second pair (0,3), output is 6. Row2's second pair (0,3) outputs 0. So same input pair can lead to different outputs depending on the row. So this theory is incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is based on the sum of the three rows' corresponding pairs. For example, the first output element is the sum of all elements in the first pairs of each row.\n\nExample 0's first pairs:\n\nRow1:4+4=8.\n\nRow2:4+0=4.\n\nRow3:0+0=0.\n\nTotal sum:8+4+0=12. Divided by 2 \u21926. So output for first element of each row is 6,6,0. How does that relate to 12? Maybe each output element is the total sum divided by 2. 12/2=6. But how does that apply to each row's output? For example, the first output row's first element is 6, but the other rows also have 6 and 0. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each output element is the sum of the corresponding pairs across all three rows. For example, the first output element is sum of Row1's first pair, Row2's first pair, Row3's first pair.\n\nRow1's first pair sum:4+4=8.\n\nRow2's first pair sum:4+0=4.\n\nRow3's first pair sum:0+0=0.\n\nTotal:8+4+0=12. 12/2=6. So output for first element is 6. But how does this translate to each row's output? The first output row's first element is 6. But the second output row's first element is also 6. So this doesn't align.\n\nThis approach is not working. Let's try to think of another pattern.\n\nLooking at the numbers 4 and 3: perhaps they are being converted to 6 when present, and 0 otherwise. But how are they combined in pairs?\n\nIf each 4 or 3 in the input is replaced by 6, then each pair in the input is summed. For example:\n\nExample 0's first input row:\n\n[4\u21926,4\u21926,0\u21920,3\u21926,3\u21926,0\u21920]\n\nGrouped into pairs:\n\n6+6=12 \u219212 \u2192 maybe divided by 2 \u21926.\n\n0+6=6 \u21926 \u21926.\n\n6+0=6 \u21926.\n\nBut the output is [6,6,0]. So this doesn't fit. The third pair would be 6, but output is 0.\n\nAlternatively, the sum is capped at 6. So 12 becomes 6. 6 stays 6. But the third pair's sum is 6, which would output 6, but in Example 0, it's 0. Contradiction.\n\nAnother idea: Maybe each pair's left element is considered, and if it's 4 or 3, it's replaced by 6; the right element is ignored. Or vice versa.\n\nExample 0's first pair (4,4) \u2192 left is 4 \u21926. Output 6. Second pair (0,3) \u2192 right is 3 \u21926. Output 6. Third pair (3,0) \u2192 left is3 \u21926. Output 0. Doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, the pair is replaced by 6 if either element is 4 or 3, but only if both are non-zero. Wait:\n\nExample 0's first pair:4 and4 \u2192 both non-zero \u21926.\n\nSecond pair:0 and3 \u21923 is non-zero \u21926.\n\nThird pair:3 and0 \u21923 is non-zero \u21926. But output is 0. So this doesn't work.\n\nAlternatively, the pair must have exactly one non-zero element (4 or 3) to output 6. If both are non-zero, output 6 as well. Otherwise, 0.\n\nExample 0's first pair: both non-zero \u21926.\n\nSecond pair: one non-zero \u21926.\n\nThird pair: one non-zero \u21926. But output is 0. So no.\n\nThis is getting me stuck. Let's look at Example 3.\n\n**Example 3 Input:**\n\nRow1: [4,4,0,3,0,0]\n\nRow2: [0,0,0,0,0,3]\n\nRow3: [4,0,0,0,0,0]\n\n**Output:**\n\n[6,6,0]\n\n[0,0,6]\n\n[6,0,0]\n\nRow1's pairs: (4,4), (0,3), (0,0). Output [6,6,0].\n\nRow2's pairs: (0,0), (0,0), (0,3). Output [0,0,6].\n\nRow3's pairs: (4,0), (0,0), (0,0). Output [6,0,0].\n\nSo in Row1, second pair (0,3) outputs 6. In Row2, third pair (0,3) outputs 6. In Row3, first pair (4,0) outputs 6. So whenever a pair has a 4 or 3, output is 6. But in Example 0's third pair (3,0) outputs 0. So this can't be right.\n\nWait, perhaps the output is 6 only if the pair contains a 4 or 3, but not both. No, because in Example 1's first pair (4,0) outputs 6, which has a 4.\n\nAlternatively, the output is 6 if the pair contains a 4, and 6 if the pair contains a 3, but not both. But that doesn't explain the conflicting examples.\n\nLet me think about the test input to see if any pattern emerges.\n\n**Test Input:**\n\nRow1: [0, 0, 4, 0, 3, 0]\n\nRow2: [0, 4, 0, 3, 3, 3]\n\nRow3: [4, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0]\n\nGrouped into pairs:\n\nRow1: (0,0), (4,0), (3,0)\n\nRow2: (0,4), (0,3), (3,3)\n\nRow3: (4,0), (0,3), (0,0)\n\nIf the output for each pair is 6 if there's at least one 4 or 3, then:\n\nRow1's pairs: (0,0)\u21920, (4,0)\u21926, (3,0)\u21926 \u2192 output [0,6,6].\n\nRow2's pairs: (0,4)\u21926, (0,3)\u21926, (3,3)\u21926 \u2192 [6,6,6].\n\nRow3's pairs: (4,0)\u21926, (0,3)\u21926, (0,0)\u21920 \u2192 [6,6,0].\n\nBut looking at the training examples, this doesn't fit. For example, in Example 0's first input row third pair (3,0) would output 6, but the actual output is 0. So this theory is invalid.\n\nBut let's check the training examples with this approach to see where it fails.\n\nExample 0 Row1: (4,4) \u21926, (0,3)\u21926, (3,0)\u21926 \u2192 output should be [6,6,6], but actual output is [6,6,0]. So discrepancy here.\n\nSo this approach is incorrect. There must be another pattern.\n\nLet's try to look for vertical patterns. Each output column is determined by the corresponding input columns.\n\nEach input has three rows, each with six elements. The output has three rows, each with three elements. Maybe each output element is derived from two columns across the three input rows.\n\nFor example, output column 1 is determined by input columns 1 and 2 across all three rows. Let's check.\n\nExample 0:\n\nInput columns 1 and 2 (first pair columns):\n\nRow1:4,4\n\nRow2:4,0\n\nRow3:0,0\n\nOutput column 1 for each row:6,6,0.\n\nIf we sum all these input elements (4+4+4+0+0+0)=12. 12/2=6. So output column 1 is 6 for the first two rows and 0 for the third. But how does this apply per row?\n\nAlternatively, for each row's pair, if any of the three rows has a non-zero in that pair, output 6. But not sure.\n\nAnother vertical approach: For each pair of columns (e.g., columns 1-2), check if there's a 4 or 3 in any of the three rows in those columns. If yes, output 6 for all rows in that pair. Otherwise, 0.\n\nFor Example 0's first pair (columns 1-2):\n\nRow1 has 4,4 \u2192 yes.\n\nRow2 has4,0 \u2192 yes.\n\nRow3 has0,0 \u2192 no.\n\nSo output for this pair would be 6 for rows1 and2, 0 for row3. Which matches Example 0's output for the first column: [6,6,0].\n\nSecond pair (columns3-4):\n\nRow1:0,3 \u2192 yes.\n\nRow2:0,3 \u2192 yes.\n\nRow3:0,0 \u2192 no.\n\nOutput for this pair would be6 for rows1 and2, 0 for row3. But Example 0's output for the second column is [6,0,0]. This doesn't fit. So this theory is invalid.\n\nAlternatively, if any row in the pair has a 4 or 3 in both elements, output 6 for that row's output element.\n\nExample 0's first pair:\n\nRow1:4 and4 \u2192 both non-zero \u21926.\n\nRow2:4 and0 \u2192 only one non-zero \u21920.\n\nRow3:0 and0 \u21920.\n\nBut Example 0's output for the first column is [6,6,0]. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAnother idea: For each row's pair, if the sum of the pair is 4+4=8, 4+0=4, 0+3=3, etc., but how does this map to 6 or 0. Perhaps the sum is divided by 2 and then multiplied by 3. For example:\n\nExample 0's first pair sum:8 \u21928/2=4 \u21924*1.5=6.\n\nSecond pair sum:3 \u21923*2=6.\n\nThird pair sum:3 \u21923*2=6. But output is 0. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, if the sum of the pair is a multiple of 3, then output 6. Else 0. For example:\n\nExample 0's first pair sum:8 \u2192 not multiple of3 \u21920. But output is6. So invalid.\n\nThis is really challenging. Let's try to find another approach.\n\nLooking at all examples, the output elements are either 0 or 6. So perhaps the input pairs are being transformed into 6 if they meet a certain condition, else 0.\n\nLet me list all pairs and their outputs to see if there's a pattern.\n\nFrom Example 0:\n\nRow1 pairs: (4,4) \u21926, (0,3)\u21926, (3,0)\u21920.\n\nRow2 pairs: (4,0) \u21926, (0,3)\u21920, (0,0)\u21920.\n\nRow3 pairs: (0,0)\u21920, (0,0)\u21920, (0,3)\u21926.\n\nFrom Example 1:\n\nRow1 pairs: (4,0)\u21926, (4,3)\u21926, (3,0)\u21926.\n\nRow2 pairs: (4,0)\u21926, (0,3)\u21920, (0,0)\u21920.\n\nRow3 pairs: (0,0)\u21926, (4,3)\u21926, (0,0)\u21926.\n\nWait, no. Example 1's input row3 is [0,0,4,3,0,0]. So pairs are (0,0), (4,3), (0,0). Output row3 is [6,0,6]. So (4,3) \u21920. That's conflicting. \n\nWait, no. Example 1's output for row3 is [6,0,6]. So the middle element is 0. So the pair (4,3) would correspond to 0. That's confusing.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is 6 if the pair contains an even number of 4s and 3s. But that doesn't seem to fit.\n\nAnother observation: In the output, each row's elements seem to be related to the presence of 4s and 3s in specific columns of the input. For example, in Example 0's output, the first row has [6,6,0]. The input's first row has 4s in the first two positions, 3s in positions4 and5. But the output's third element is 0. How does that relate?\n\nAlternatively, maybe each pair in the input is being replaced by 6 if both elements are non-zero (4 or 3), and 0 otherwise. Let's check:\n\nExample 0's first pair (4,4): both non-zero \u21926. Second pair (0,3): one non-zero \u21920. But output is6. So no.\n\nAlternatively, if at least one element in the pair is non-zero (4 or 3), output 6. Else 0.\n\nExample 0's first pair (4,4) \u21926.\n\nSecond pair (0,3) \u21926.\n\nThird pair (3,0) \u21926. But output is0. So this doesn't fit.\n\nBut in Example 0's output row1, third element is0, which corresponds to pair (3,0). So this theory is invalid.\n\nAnother possibility: The output is 6 if the sum of the pair is divisible by 3. For example, 4+4=8 \u21928%3=2 \u21920. But output is6. So no.\n\nWait, but 4 and 3 sum to 7, which isn't divisible by3. Yet in some examples, they result in 6. So this can't be.\n\nAnother angle: The numbers 4 and 3 might represent positions or letters. For example, 4 is the fourth letter (D), 3 is the third (C). But how this becomes 6 is unclear.\n\nAlternatively, 4 and 3 could be converted to 6 via some operation. For instance, 4 + 3 =7, but 7 modulo something equals 6. Not helpful.\n\nWait, 4 and 3 are the only non-zero numbers in the inputs. Maybe they are being counted, and each occurrence contributes to the output. For example, each 4 or 3 in the input contributes 3 to the corresponding output pair. But how?\n\nIn Example 0's first input row, there are four 4s and two 3s. The output has three 6s. 6 is 2\u00d73. So maybe each pair's count of 4s and 3s is multiplied by 3. For example, first pair has two 4s \u21922\u00d73=6. Second pair has one 3 \u21921\u00d73=3 \u2192 but output is6. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, each pair's count of 4s and 3s is multiplied by 3. So for a pair with two 4s, output is 6. A pair with one 3, output is 3. But in Example 0's output, the second element is 6, not 3. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAnother idea: Each 4 and 3 is treated as a 3, and the sum of each pair is multiplied by 2. For example:\n\nExample 0's first pair:4+4 \u21923+3=6 \u21926\u00d71=6.\n\nSecond pair:0+3 \u21920+3=3 \u21923\u00d72=6.\n\nThird pair:3+0 \u21923+0=3 \u21923\u00d72=6. But output is0. So this doesn't work.\n\nThis is really challenging. Let's try to look for another pattern. Maybe the output is determined by the number of 4s and 3s in the entire row or column.\n\nAlternatively, think of the input as three separate 3x2 grids, and the output is a 3x3 grid where each cell depends on the corresponding two cells in the input.\n\nFor example, the first column of the output depends on the first two columns of the input. Maybe for each row, if the first two elements are both 4s, output 6. If one is 4 and the other is 0, output 6. If one is 3 and the other is 0, output 6. But when?\n\nIn Example 0's first row's first two elements are 4 and4 \u21926. Second row's first two elements are4 and0 \u21926. Third row's first two elements are0 and0 \u21920. Which matches the first output column of Example 0:6,6,0.\n\nExample 0's second output column:6,0,0. This would correspond to the third and fourth elements of each input row.\n\nRow1's third and fourth elements:0 and3 \u21926.\n\nRow2's third and fourth elements:0 and3 \u21920.\n\nRow3's third and fourth elements:0 and0 \u21920.\n\nSo the pattern here seems to be that if the third element is 0 and fourth is 3, output 6 for the first row but 0 for the second row. How?\n\nMaybe the output is 6 if the first element of the pair is 4 and the second is anything, or the second element is 3 and the first is anything. But this doesn't fit.\n\nRow1's third and fourth elements:0 and3 \u2192 output 6. If the second element is3, then output 6. So this fits.\n\nRow2's third and fourth elements:0 and3 \u2192 output0. So this contradicts.\n\nThis is getting me nowhere. Let's think differently. Maybe each pair in the input is mapped to 6 if the sum of the pair is greater than or equal to 4. Let's check:\n\nExample 0's first pair sum:8 \u21926.\n\nSecond pair sum:3 \u21923 <4 \u21920. But output is6. So no.\n\nAnother idea: Maybe the output is 6 if the pair contains a 4 or a 3, and the pair is in an odd position. But that seems arbitrary.\n\nAt this point, I think I need to look for a pattern in the training examples that leads to the outputs, possibly based on the counts of 4s and 3s in specific positions or pairs, but I'm not seeing it clearly. \n\nLet me try to look at the test input and see if I can find a pattern that fits both the training examples and the test input.\n\nTest Input:\n\nRow1: [0, 0, 4, 0, 3, 0] \u2192 pairs (0,0), (4,0), (3,0)\n\nRow2: [0, 4, 0, 3, 3, 3] \u2192 pairs (0,4), (0,3), (3,3)\n\nRow3: [4, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0] \u2192 pairs (4,0), (0,3), (0,0)\n\nLooking at the training examples, especially Example 4's input:\n\nInput Row3: [0,0,4,3,3,0] \u2192 pairs (0,0), (4,3), (3,0). Output is [6,6,6]. So pair (4,3) \u21926, (3,0) \u21926.\n\nIn the test input, Row2's third pair is (3,3) \u2192 perhaps this becomes 6. Row1's third pair is (3,0) \u21926. Row3's second pair (0,3) \u21926. But according to Example 0's first row third pair (3,0) output is0. So this is inconsistent.\n\nThis is really perplexing. Let me try to find a different approach.\n\nAnother observation: In the output, the 6s are always in positions where there's a 4 or 3 in the input. Maybe each output element is 6 if the corresponding pair in the input contains a 4 or 3, but only if there's an even number of non-zero elements in the entire row. Or something like that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the count of 4s and 3s in the pair multiplied by 3. For example, a pair with two 4s \u21922*3=6. A pair with one 3 \u21921*3=3 \u2192 but output is6. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, the output is 6 if the pair has at least one 4, and 6 if it has at least one 3, but 0 otherwise. But in Example 0's first input row, second pair (0,3) \u21926. Third pair (3,0) \u21926. But output is0. So this is not possible.\n\nWait, maybe the output is 6 if the pair contains a 4, and 6 if it contains a 3, but not both. No, because in Example 1's pair (4,3) \u21926, but in Example 0's pair (3,0) \u21920.\n\nAnother idea: The output for each pair is 6 if the sum of the pair's elements is 4 or 3. For example, 4+0=4 \u21926. 3+0=3 \u21926. 4+4=8 \u2192 not. But in Example 0's first pair sum 8 \u2192 output is6. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAt this point, I'm stuck and need to think of a different strategy. Let's look at the outputs and see if there's a pattern in their arrangement.\n\nExample 0's output rows:\n\n[6,6,0]\n\n[6,0,0]\n\n[0,0,6]\n\nExample 1's output:\n\n[6,6,6]\n\n[6,0,0]\n\n[6,0,6]\n\nExample 2's output:\n\n[0,6,6]\n\n[6,6,6]\n\n[6,6,6]\n\nExample 3's output:\n\n[6,6,0]\n\n[0,0,6]\n\n[6,0,0]\n\nExample 4's output:\n\n[0,6,0]\n\n[6,0,0]\n\n[6,6,6]\n\nLooking at these outputs, it seems that 6s are clustered, perhaps based on the presence of 4s and 3s in certain columns. For example, in Example 0's output, the first two elements of the first two rows are 6, and the last element of the third row is 6. Maybe each output column corresponds to a pair of input columns, and if there's a 4 in the first column of any row, then the output column is 6.\n\nAlternatively, each output column is 6 if the corresponding input columns have at least one 4 or 3 in any row. For example:\n\nTest input's first pair columns (columns 1-2):\n\nRow1:0,0 \u2192 no.\n\nRow2:0,4 \u2192 yes.\n\nRow3:4,0 \u2192 yes.\n\nSo output column 1 would be6 for all rows. But according to the training examples, this may vary. \n\nExample 0's first output column has 6,6,0. The input columns 1-2 have 4s in rows1 and2, 0s in row3. So output column is6 for rows1 and2, 0 for row3. This suggests that the output column is 6 for a row if the corresponding pair in that row has a 4 or3. \n\nBut then, in Example 0's row1, second pair (0,3) has a 3, so output is6. Row2's second pair (0,3) has a3, but output is0. So this theory is incorrect.\n\nAnother possibility: The output for each pair in a row is 6 if the pair contains a 4 or 3, and that pair is the first occurrence of a 4 or3 in that column across all rows. For example, if a column's first non-zero pair is in a certain row, then that row's output is6, others are0. But this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, the output for each pair is 6 if the pair in that row is the first in its column to have a 4 or3. For example, in Example 0's first column (columns1-2):\n\nRow1 has 4,4 \u2192 first occurrence \u21926.\n\nRow2 has4,0 \u2192 not first \u21920.\n\nRow3 has0,0 \u21920.\n\nBut the output for the first column is6,6,0. So this doesn't fit.\n\nThis is extremely challenging. Given the time I've spent and lack of progress, I think I need to make an educated guess based on the examples.\n\nObserving that in the test input:\n\nRow1 pairs: (0,0), (4,0), (3,0) \u2192 possible outputs 0,6,6.\n\nRow2 pairs: (0,4), (0,3), (3,3) \u2192 possible outputs6,6,6.\n\nRow3 pairs: (4,0), (0,3), (0,0) \u2192 possible outputs6,6,0.\n\nLooking at similar training examples:\n\nExample 4's input has a pair (0,3) in the third row, which outputs6. So maybe any pair with a 3 outputs6, regardless of position. But in Example 0's third pair (3,0), output is0. So this is conflicting.\n\nBut perhaps there's a vertical component. For each pair across all three rows, if there's at least one 4 or3 in that column pair, then output 6 for each row where the pair has a 4 or3.\n\nFor example, Test input's second pair (columns3-4):\n\nRow1:4,0 \u21924 present \u21926.\n\nRow2:0,3 \u21923 present \u21926.\n\nRow3:0,3 \u21923 present \u21926.\n\nSo output for this pair would be [6,6,6].\n\nBut how does this fit with Example 0's third pair (columns5-6):\n\nRow1:3,0 \u21923 present \u21926.\n\nRow2:0,0 \u21920.\n\nRow3:0,3 \u21923 present \u21926.\n\nSo output for this pair would be [6,0,6], but in Example 0's output, the third column is [0,0,6]. So this doesn't fit.\n\nThis is getting me nowhere. Given time constraints, I'll have to make a guess based on the test input and the closest training example.\n\nLooking at the test input's pairs:\n\nRow1: (0,0) \u21920, (4,0) \u21926, (3,0) \u21926.\n\nRow2: (0,4) \u21926, (0,3) \u21926, (3,3) \u21926.\n\nRow3: (4,0) \u21926, (0,3) \u21926, (0,0) \u21920.\n\nSo the output would be:\n\nRow1: [0,6,6]\n\nRow2: [6,6,6]\n\nRow3: [6,6,0]\n\nBut looking at training examples, when there's a pair with (4,0), it outputs6. When there's (3,0), sometimes 6, sometimes 0. \n\nIn Example 3's input, row3's first pair is (4,0), output is6. So perhaps pairs with 4 or3 in any position output6. So for the test input, the output would be:\n\nRow1:0 (from 0,0),6 (4,0),6 (3,0).\n\nRow2:6 (0,4),6 (0,3),6 (3,3).\n\nRow3:6 (4,0),6 (0,3),0 (0,0).\n\nThus, the final answer would be:\n\n[0,6,6]\n\n[6,6,6]\n\n[6,6,0]\n\nBut looking at the training examples, this might not fit all cases. For example, Example 0's third pair (3,0) outputs0, but according to this pattern, it would be6. However, in Example 0's output, it is0. So there's a contradiction.\n\nThis suggests that the pattern is more complex, perhaps involving vertical checks or other conditions. Given the time, I'll proceed with this guess, but acknowledge that it might not be correct.",

        "cot_2": "Okay, let's tackle this puzzle. So, I need to figure out the pattern that transforms the input lists into the output lists. Let's look at the training examples and see if I can spot any patterns.\n\nStarting with Example 0. The input is three rows:\n\n[4,4,0,3,3,0]\n[4,0,0,3,0,0]\n[0,0,0,0,0,3]\n\nThe output is:\n\n[6,6,0]\n[6,0,0]\n[0,0,6]\n\nHmm, the input arrays are longer than the output. The input has 6 elements per row, and the output has 3. So maybe each pair of elements in the input is combined into one in the output. Let's see. For the first input row, [4,4,0,3,3,0], if we group them into pairs: (4,4), (0,3), (3,0). Then the output is [6,6,0]. Wait, 4+4=8, but the output is 6. So maybe not addition. Or maybe something else. Let's check other examples.\n\nIn Example 1, input rows are:\n\n[4,0,4,3,3,0]\n[4,0,0,3,0,0]\n[0,0,4,3,0,0]\n\nOutput:\n\n[6,6,6]\n[6,0,0]\n[6,0,6]\n\nLooking at the first input row, pairs are (4,0), (4,3), (3,0). Output is 6,6,6. Hmm. How does 4 and 0 become 6? Maybe it's taking the sum, but only if both are non-zero. Or maybe if there's a non-zero in each pair, add them, but replace with 6. Wait, let's check.\n\nWait, in Example 0's first input row: (4,4) becomes 6. 4+4=8, but 6. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe 4 and 3 are involved. Wait, in the input arrays, the numbers are 4s and 3s, and 0s. The outputs are 6s and 0s.\n\nWait, maybe each pair in the input is being replaced by 6 if the sum of the two numbers is 6 or higher? Let's see. For example 0's first pair: 4+4=8, which is more than 6. So becomes 6. The second pair: 0+3=3, which is less than 6. So maybe 0? But in the output, the second element is 6. Wait, no. Wait in example 0's output first row is [6,6,0]. The second pair (0,3) becomes 6. Wait, 0+3=3. That's not 6. Hmm, maybe that's not the right approach.\n\nWait, maybe each pair is 4 and 3. Let's look at the first example's input. The first row is 4,0,4,3,3,0. The pairs are (4,0), (4,3), (3,0). Output is 6,6,6. So 4 and 0 sum to 4, but output 6. 4 and 3 sum to 7, which becomes 6. 3 and 0 sum to 3, output 6. That doesn't fit a sum-based rule.\n\nAlternative idea: perhaps 4 and 3 are considered as parts of a 7-segment display. But that seems a stretch. Or maybe 4 and 3 are converted to letters (D and C?), but the output is numbers. Not sure.\n\nAnother angle: looking at the output numbers, they are all 6 or 0. So maybe whenever there's a non-zero in the pair, it's 6. But in example 0's first row, the first two elements are 4 and 4. The output is 6. Then the next pair is 0 and 3. Output 6. Then 3 and 0. Output 0. Wait, that doesn't fit. Because the output third element in first example 0's output is 0, but the input pair is 3 and 0. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe each pair is summed, and if the sum is >=4, replace with 6. Let's test.\n\nIn example 0, first pair sum 8, becomes 6. Second pair 0+3=3, but output is 6. So that's not matching. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe each pair has a 4 and/or 3. Let's see. If a pair contains both 4 and 3, maybe it's 6. Or maybe count the number of non-zero elements. For example, in example 0's first row:\n\nPair 1: 4 and 4 \u2192 two non-zero \u2192 6.\n\nPair 2: 0 and 3 \u2192 one non-zero \u2192 6?\n\nBut in the first example's first row, pair (4,0) \u2192 one non-zero. Output is 6. So if even one non-zero in the pair, output 6. But in example 0's third row, the third pair (0,3) \u2192 one non-zero, and output is 6. But the third element of the first row's output is 0, which corresponds to the third pair (3,0). But in that case, there's a 3 and a 0. So that would have one non-zero. But output is 0. Hmm, so that contradicts.\n\nAlternative approach: Maybe each pair is being checked for the presence of a 4 and a 3. For example, if a pair has both 4 and 3, then it's 6. Or something else. Let me check.\n\nWait, in example 0's first input row: [4,4,0,3,3,0]. The pairs are (4,4), (0,3), (3,0). The first pair is two 4s. Second pair is 0 and 3. Third pair is 3 and 0. The output is [6,6,0]. So why is the third pair output 0? Maybe the sum of 3 and 0 is 3, which is not 6. But why 0?\n\nWait, in the output examples, the 6s are appearing where there's a combination of 4s and 3s. Maybe when a pair has a 4 and a 3, their sum is 7, but in the output it's 6. But how? Alternatively, perhaps each 4 is converted to 3 and each 3 is converted to 3, and sum them. Wait, 4+3=7, but output is 6. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each pair is grouped into two elements, and the output is 6 if either element is non-zero, but only if they are in a certain way.\n\nWait, looking at example 0's third input row: [0,0,0,0,0,3]. The pairs are (0,0), (0,0), (0,3). The output is [0,0,6]. So the third pair (0,3) becomes 6. So maybe if either element in the pair is non-zero, the output is 6. But then in example 0's first row, the third pair (3,0) would also be non-zero, but the output is 0. That contradicts. So that's not it.\n\nWait, let's think differently. Maybe the output is the count of non-zero elements in the pair multiplied by 3. For example, if a pair has two non-zero elements, 2*3=6. If one, then 3. But in example 0's first row, the first pair (4,4) \u2192 2 non-zero \u2192 6, which matches. The second pair (0,3) \u2192 1 \u2192 3, but output is 6. So that's not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's 6 if there are any non-zero elements, but that doesn't explain the 0s. Hmm.\n\nWait, looking at the outputs, all the 6s are in positions where in the input pairs, there's at least one 4 or 3, but maybe when the sum is 4+3=7, which could be converted to 6. Wait, but in example 0, first pair is 4 and 4. Their sum is 8. How does that relate to 6? Maybe modulo 6? 8 mod 6 is 2. No. Or maybe the sum is divided by something. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the numbers 4 and 3 are being treated as part of a clock, where 4 + 3 = 7, but 7 mod 12 is 7, but that's not 6. Not helpful.\n\nWait, let's look at another example. Example 1's input first row is [4,0,4,3,3,0]. The pairs are (4,0), (4,3), (3,0). Output is [6,6,6]. So each pair here, whether it's 4 and 0, 4 and3, or 3 and 0, all become 6. So the output is all 6s. How?\n\nHmm. Maybe if either element is 4 or 3, then the output is 6, regardless of the pair. But then why in example 0's first row, the third pair (3,0) outputs 0. Wait, that's conflicting.\n\nWait, in example 0's first row, the third pair is (3,0), which becomes 0. But in example 1's first row, the third pair is (3,0) and becomes 6. That's inconsistent. So that can't be the case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the sum of the pair is 4+3=7, which is turned into 6, but 4+4=8 becomes 6. How? Maybe sum the digits and take modulo 6. 4+4=8 \u2192 8 mod 6=2, which isn't 6. So that's not it.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each 4 is counted as 3 and each 3 as 3. So 4+4=6, 4+3=6, 3+3=6. But then 0s would not contribute. Let's test this. For example 0's first pair: 4+4 \u2192 3+3=6. So output 6. Second pair 0+3 \u2192 0+3=3, which isn't 6. But in example 0's first output row, the second element is 6, so this doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. Maybe it's the count of non-zero elements in the pair, but with a twist. For example, if a pair has two non-zero elements, output 6. If one, output 3. But in example 0's first output row, the first pair (4,4) has two non-zero \u21926. Second pair (0,3) has one \u21923. But the output is 6. So that's not matching. So that's not it.\n\nWait, let's look at example 4's input and output. Example 4's input is:\n\n[0,0,0,0,3,0]\n[4,0,0,0,0,0]\n[0,0,4,3,3,0]\n\nOutput:\n\n[0,6,0]\n[6,0,0]\n[6,6,6]\n\nSo first input row: [0,0,0,0,3,0]. Pairs are (0,0), (0,0), (3,0). The output is [0,6,0]. Wait, why the second element is 6? The second pair is (0,0), output 6? That doesn't fit. Or maybe I'm grouping the pairs wrong. Maybe the way the pairs are grouped is different.\n\nWait, perhaps the pairs are not consecutive elements. Maybe the first element of the output is the sum of the first and fourth elements of the input row. For example, in example 0's first input row: [4,4,0,3,3,0]. The output is [6,6,0]. Let's see:\n\nIf output elements are first, third, fifth elements of the input? But 4,0,3 \u2192 sum? 4+0+3=7, which doesn't match. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each output element is a combination of two elements from the input, but not consecutive. For example, the first output element is the sum of input positions 0 and 3. Let's check example 0's first input row: positions 0=4, 3=3. 4+3=7. Output is 6. Hmm, maybe 7 mod something. Or perhaps 4 and 3 are being converted to 6. Wait, 4+3=7, but output is 6. Maybe it's 4 + 3 -1=6. Hmm, but what about other pairs.\n\nIn example 1's first input row: [4,0,4,3,3,0]. The output is [6,6,6]. Let's check the possible pairs. If the output elements are input positions 0+3, 1+4, 2+5.\n\nFor the first output element: 4 (position 0) +3 (position3) =7 \u21926. Second:0 (pos1) +3 (pos4)=3 \u21926? No. Third:4 (pos2) +0 (pos5)=4 \u21926. Doesn't fit. So maybe not.\n\nAlternative idea: The output is three elements per row, the same as the input has three pairs. So input is six elements, grouped into three pairs. For each pair, if the sum is even, it's 6; else, 0? Let's test.\n\nExample 0 first pair: 4+4=8 (even) \u21926. Second pair 0+3=3 (odd) \u21920. But output is 6 here. So that's not.\n\nHmm. Let's look at example 3. Input rows:\n\n[4,4,0,3,0,0]\n[0,0,0,0,0,3]\n[4,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nOutput:\n\n[6,6,0]\n[0,0,6]\n[6,0,0]\n\nLooking at first input row: pairs (4,4), (0,3), (0,0). Output is 6,6,0. So first pair sum 8 \u21926, second sum 3 \u21926. Third sum 0 \u21920. So maybe whenever the sum is \u22654, it's 6, otherwise 0. Wait:\n\nIn first example 3's first row, pair 0+3 sum 3, which is less than 4. But output is 6. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternative approach: Let's see how 4 and 3 are treated. Maybe each 4 is converted to 3 and each 3 remains 3, then sum. So for example, in example 0's first pair: 4 and4 \u21923+3=6. So output 6. Second pair 0 and3 \u21920+3=3 \u2192 output 3? But output is 6. So that's not.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps 4 is replaced with 3 and 3 is replaced with 3, then sum. So 4+4 \u21923+3=6. 0+3 \u21920+3=3 \u2192 but output is 6. So that doesn't work. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps each occurrence of 4 or 3 in the input is counted, and for each pair in the input, the output is 6 if there's at least one 4 or 3 in the pair, otherwise 0. But in example 0's first row, pair (0,3) has a 3 \u21926. Pair (3,0) has a 3 \u21926, but output is 0. So that's a contradiction.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is 6 if both elements in the pair are non-zero. Let's check example 0's first row: pairs (4,4) \u2192 both non-zero \u21926. Second pair (0,3) \u2192 only one non-zero \u21920? But output is 6. So that's not it.\n\nHmm, this is tricky. Let's look at example 2's input and output.\n\nExample 2's input:\n\n[0,0,4,0,3,0]\n[0,4,4,3,0,3]\n[4,4,0,0,0,3]\n\nOutput:\n\n[0,6,6]\n[6,6,6]\n[6,6,6]\n\nLooking at the first input row: pairs (0,0), (4,0), (3,0). Output is [0,6,6]. So for (0,0) \u21920, (4,0) \u21926, (3,0) \u21926. So here, if the pair contains a 4 or 3, then 6. But (4,0) has a 4, so 6. (3,0) has a 3, so 6. But why the first pair (0,0) is 0. So maybe any pair with at least one 4 or 3 becomes 6. But in example 0's first row, the third pair (3,0) \u21926 in example 0's output. But according to the output of example 0, the third element is 0. Wait, no. In example 0's output first row is [6,6,0]. So the third pair (3,0) \u21920. That contradicts.\n\nWait, example 0's input first row is [4,4,0,3,3,0]. The pairs are (4,4), (0,3), (3,0). Output is [6,6,0]. So the third pair (3,0) outputs 0. But according to the previous idea (if pair contains 4 or 3, output 6), this would be 6. But it's 0. So that's a problem.\n\nAlternative idea: Maybe the output is determined by the presence of 4 and 3 in the same pair. For example, if a pair contains both a 4 and a 3, then output 6. Otherwise, sum the non-zero elements. Let's test.\n\nExample 0's first pair (4,4): no 3, so sum is 8. Output is 6. Hmm. 8\u21926. Second pair (0,3): sum 3. Output 6. So that's not matching. Third pair (3,0): sum 3. Output 0. Doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each 4 and 3 is replaced by 3, and then summed. So 4 becomes 3, 3 remains 3. So (4,4) \u21923+3=6. (0,3) \u21920+3=3 \u21926? No. But in example 0's output, the second element is 6. So this doesn't explain.\n\nHmm. Maybe looking at the positions. Let's see:\n\nIn example 0's input rows:\n\nRow 1: [4,4,0,3,3,0]\nRow 2: [4,0,0,3,0,0]\nRow3: [0,0,0,0,0,3]\n\nThe output rows are:\n\n[6,6,0]\n[6,0,0]\n[0,0,6]\n\nIf I look at the first output row, each element corresponds to a pair in the input row. So first pair (4,4) \u21926. Second pair (0,3) \u21926. Third pair (3,0) \u21920.\n\nWait, why is the third pair's output 0? The input pair is 3 and 0. In other examples, like example 1's third pair (3,0) outputs 6. So why is it different here?\n\nAh! Wait, maybe it's the order of the pairs. Let me check how the pairs are formed. Maybe the input is split into three pairs, each consisting of elements from the first and second halves. For example, in a six-element row, the first three elements and the last three elements. So pairs are (element 0 and element3), (element1 and element4), (element2 and element5). Let's test this.\n\nTake example 0's first input row: [4,4,0,3,3,0].\n\nSo pairs would be (4 and3), (4 and3), (0 and0). Then the output is [6,6,0]. Sum of each pair:\n\n4+3=7 \u21926. 4+3=7\u21926. 0+0=0. So maybe sum each pair and if sum >=6, output 6. Else 0. Wait, 4+3=7\u21926. 4+3=7\u21926. 0+0=0\u21920. But in example 0's output first row, third element is 0. So that fits.\n\nLet's test another example. Example1's first input row: [4,0,4,3,3,0].\n\nPairs would be (4 and3), (0 and3), (4 and0). Sums: 7\u21926, 3\u21920, 4\u21926. But the output is [6,6,6]. Hmm, that doesn't fit. Because sum of 0 and3 is 3, which would output 0, but the output is 6. So that's a problem.\n\nWait, maybe the rule is sum each pair and if sum >=4, output 6, else 0. Let's test.\n\nExample0's first row pairs sum to 7,7,0. All >=4 except the third. So output [6,6,0]. That matches.\n\nExample1's first row pairs: (4+3)=7\u21926, (0+3)=3\u21920, (4+0)=4\u21926. So output would be [6,0,6]. But the actual output is [6,6,6]. So that doesn't match.\n\nHmm. So this idea is not correct.\n\nAlternative approach: Perhaps each pair is multiplied and then adjusted. 4*3=12, which mod 6 is 0. Not helpful.\n\nWait, maybe the output is 6 whenever there's a 4 and a 3 in the pair. For example, if the pair contains both a 4 and a 3, then 6. Otherwise, sum of the pair.\n\nIn example0's first row pairs: (4,3) \u21926. (4,3) \u21926. (0,0)\u21920. So output [6,6,0]. Which matches.\n\nExample1's first row pairs: (4,3)\u21926. (0,3)\u21923. (4,0)\u21924. Output is [6,6,6]. So this doesn't fit. Because the second and third pairs sum to 3 and 4, but output is 6.\n\nWait, maybe the output is 6 for any pair that has at least one 4 or 3. Then:\n\nExample0's first row pairs: (4,3)\u2192 yes, (4,3)\u2192 yes, (0,0)\u2192 no. So output [6,6,0]. Which matches.\n\nExample1's first row pairs: (4,3)\u2192 yes, (0,3)\u2192 yes, (4,0)\u2192 yes. So output [6,6,6]. Which matches.\n\nExample0's third input row: pairs (0,0), (0,0), (0,3). The third pair has a 3. So output [0,0,6], which matches.\n\nExample2's first input row: pairs (0,0), (0,0), (4,3). So output [0,0,6]. But actual output is [0,6,6]. Wait, no. Let me check example2's input.\n\nExample2's input rows:\n\n[0,0,4,0,3,0] \u2192 pairs (0,0), (0,3), (4,0). So pairs are (0 and0), (0 and3), (4 and0). So at least one 4 or 3 in pairs 2 and 3. So output would be [0,6,6]. Which matches the output [0,6,6].\n\nYes! So this seems to fit. The rule is: For each pair formed by combining the first and fourth elements, second and fifth, third and sixth (positions 0+3, 1+4, 2+5), the output is 6 if either element in the pair is a 4 or 3. Otherwise, 0.\n\nLet's test this with example3:\n\nInput row 1: [4,4,0,3,0,0]. Pairs are (4,3), (4,0), (0,0). So 4 and3 \u21926, 4 in second pair \u21926, third pair 0,0\u21920. Output is [6,6,0], which matches.\n\nExample4's input row 3: [0,0,4,3,3,0]. Pairs are (0,3), (0,3), (4,0). All pairs have at least 3 or4. So output [6,6,6], which matches the output.\n\nYes! This seems to be the pattern. So the transformation is:\n\nFor each row in the input, split into three pairs: (element0, element3), (element1, element4), (element2, element5). For each pair, if either element is 4 or 3, output 6. Otherwise, output 0.\n\nNow, applying this to the test input:\n\nTest input:\n\nRow 1: [0,0,4,0,3,0]\n\nPairs: (0,0), (0,3), (4,0). So 0+0 \u21920, 0+3\u21926 (since 3 is present), 4+0\u21926. So output row1: [0,6,6].\n\nRow2: [0,4,0,3,3,3]\n\nPairs: (0,3), (4,3), (0,3). All pairs have at least 3 or4. So output [6,6,6].\n\nRow3: [4,0,0,3,0,0]\n\nPairs: (4,3), (0,0), (0,0). First pair has 4 and3 \u21926, others 0. So output [6,0,0].\n\nBut wait, let's check the pairing again.\n\nRow1 of test input:\n\nElements: 0 (0),0 (1),4 (2),0 (3),3 (4),0 (5). \n\nPair0: 0 and0 \u21920.\n\nPair1:0 (1) and3 (4) \u21920 and3 \u21926.\n\nPair2:4 (2) and0 (5) \u21924 and0 \u21926.\n\nSo output [0,6,6].\n\nRow2: elements 0,4,0,3,3,3.\n\nPair0:0 and3 \u21926.\n\nPair1:4 and3 \u21926.\n\nPair2:0 and3 \u21926.\n\nSo output [6,6,6].\n\nRow3:4,0,0,3,0,0.\n\nPair0:4 and3 \u21926.\n\nPair1:0 and0 \u21920.\n\nPair2:0 and0 \u21920.\n\nSo output [6,0,0].\n\nSo the final output would be:\n\n[0,6,6]\n\n[6,6,6]\n\n[6,0,0]\n\nBut let's check the training examples to see if this fits. For example, in example0's third input row [0,0,0,0,0,3], the pairs are (0,0), (0,0), (0,3). So output [0,0,6], which matches.\n\nYes, this pattern seems consistent. So the answer should be the output generated by applying this rule."
