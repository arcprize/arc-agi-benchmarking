        "cot_1": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. So, the problem is to transform the input matrix into the output matrix based on the training examples. Let's look through the examples step by step.\n\nStarting with Example 0:\nInput:\n[0,0,0]\n[1,0,0]\n[0,0,0]\nOutput:\n[2,0,0]\n[0,0,0]\n[0,0,0]\nHmm, the 1 in the second row first column turned into a 0 in the output, and the cell above it (first row first column) became a 2. So maybe the 2s are placed in positions adjacent to the 1s, but there's some rule here.\n\nLooking at Example 1:\nInput:\n[0,1,0]\n[1,0,0]\n[0,0,0]\nOutput has two 2s in the first row. The 1s in the first row second column and second row first column. The output first row becomes [2,2,0]. So maybe each 1 is causing certain cells to turn into 2s. Let's check the positions. The original 1 in (0,1) (row 0, column 1) and (1,0). In the output, the cells around them might be turning into 2s. Wait, but in Example 0, the 1 is at (1,0), and the output's (0,0) becomes 2. So maybe each 1 affects the cell above it? But in Example 1, there's a 1 at (0,1) which is the first row, so maybe the cell above it would be out of bounds. Or perhaps it's the cells adjacent in some direction.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are replacing the 1s and propagating upwards or in a specific direction. Wait, in Example 0, the 1 is at (1,0), and the output's (0,0) is 2. So maybe each 1 in the grid is converted into a 2 in the cell directly above it. If that cell is out of bounds, maybe it wraps around, but in the examples, it doesn't look like wrapping. Let's check another example.\n\nExample 4:\nInput:\n[0,0,1]\n[0,0,0]\n[0,0,0]\nOutput first row is [2,0,0]. The 1 is in (0,2). So according to the previous idea, the cell above (0,2) would be row -1, which doesn't exist, but here the output's (0,0) is 2. That doesn't fit. Hmm, maybe not direction-based.\n\nAlternative approach: Maybe the output is the sum of the number of 1s in the same column above each cell. Wait, in Example 0, the 1 is in row 1 column 0. So for the first row, column 0, there's a 1 below it. But how does that turn into 2? Alternatively, each 1 in the input causes certain cells to become 2 in the output. Let's think about how many 2s each 1 is generating.\n\nAnother idea: Maybe each 1 in the input adds a 2 in the same row, but shifted left or right. Let's see. For Example 0: The 1 is in [1,0], and the output has a 2 in [0,0]. So maybe each 1 adds a 2 one row above and same column. But Example 1: The 1 in row 0, column 1 would add a 2 in row -1 (invalid), but the output in row 0 has a 2. Alternatively, maybe the 2 is placed in the same row, but to the left of the 1. Wait, in Example 0, the 1 is in column 0 of row 1. The output's 2 is in row 0, column 0. So that's directly above. But in Example 1, the 1 is in row 0, column 1, so the cell above would be out of bounds, but in the output, that cell (row 0, column 1) becomes 2. Wait, that can't be. Or perhaps the 1's influence spreads to the left and above?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are placed in all cells to the left and above each 1. Let's test this.\n\nIn Example 0: The 1 is at (1,0). To the left would be same row, column -1 (invalid). Above would be (0,0). So output (0,0) is 2. That fits.\n\nExample 1: 1s at (0,1) and (1,0). For (0,1), left is (0,0), above is invalid. So (0,0) and (0,1) become 2? But the output is [2,2,0]. Hmm, yes. For (1,0), left is invalid, above is (0,0). So combining both, (0,0) and (0,1) are 2s, and also (0,0) again. But the output shows [2,2,0]. So maybe each 1 adds 2s to all cells above and to the left, including the current cell's position? Wait, not sure.\n\nWait, let's take Example 1:\n\nInput has 1s at (0,1) and (1,0). For (0,1), moving left would be (0,0), and moving up would be nothing. So (0,0) and (0,1) become 2. For (1,0), moving left is nothing, moving up is (0,0). So (0,0) again. So total 2s at (0,0), (0,1), and (0,0). So merged, they have (0,0) and (0,1) as 2s. Which matches the output. So that seems to fit.\n\nAnother example: Example 2:\n\nInput has 1s at (0,2) and (2,0). Let's see.\n\nFor (0,2): left is (0,1), (0,0). Up is nothing. So left cells (0,1) and (0,0) become 2.\n\nFor (2,0): up is (1,0), (0,0). So (1,0) and (0,0) become 2.\n\nSo combining these, 2s would be in (0,0), (0,1), (0,0), (1,0), (0,0). But the output is [2,2,0], [0,0,0], etc. Wait, the output for Example 2 is first row [2,2,0], so (0,0) and (0,1) are 2s. How does (1,0) not get a 2? Because according to the previous logic, the 1 at (2,0) would add 2s to (1,0) and (0,0). But in the output, (1,0) is 0. Hmm, this contradicts the idea. So maybe that's not the pattern.\n\nWait, let me check Example 2's output again. Output is:\n\n[2,2,0]\n[0,0,0]\n[0,0,0]\n\nBut according to the 1s at (0,2) and (2,0), if each 1 spreads 2s to the left and up, then (0,2)'s left cells would be (0,1) and (0,0), and (2,0)'s up would be (1,0) and (0,0). So the 2s would be (0,0), (0,1), (1,0), and (0,0). But output only shows (0,0) and (0,1) as 2. So this contradicts. So that approach might be wrong.\n\nAlternative idea: Maybe the 2s are in the same column as the 1, but all rows above. So for a 1 in row r, column c, all cells in column c, rows 0 to r-1 become 2. Let's test this.\n\nExample 0: 1 at (1,0). So column 0, rows 0. So output (0,0) is 2. Correct.\n\nExample 1: 1s at (0,1) and (1,0). For (0,1), rows above would be none (since r=0), so column 1 rows 0? Wait, maybe for each 1 at (r,c), set all cells in column c from row 0 up to r-1 to 2. So for (0,1), r=0, r-1 is -1, so no cells. For (1,0), column 0, rows 0. So only (0,0) becomes 2. But output has (0,0) and (0,1) as 2. So this doesn't fit. So that's not it.\n\nAlternative approach: Maybe the 2s are placed in the first row, in the columns where there are 1s in any row below. For example, in Example 0, the 1 is in column 0, so first row column 0 becomes 2. In Example 1, there are 1s in columns 1 and 0, so first row columns 0 and 1 become 2. Example 2: 1s in columns 2 and 0. So first row columns 0 and 2 become 2. But the output of Example 2 is first row [2,2,0], so columns 0 and 1. Hmm, that doesn't fit. So maybe that's not it.\n\nWait, Example 2's input has 1s at (0,2) and (2,0). The output first row is [2,2,0]. So columns 0 and 1 are 2. But according to the columns of 1s (columns 0 and 2), why are columns 0 and 1 in first row 2? That's confusing. So maybe there's another pattern.\n\nAnother thought: Maybe it's a cellular automaton where each 1 turns into 0 and propagates 2s in certain directions. For instance, each 1 spreads 2s to the cells to the left and above, but only if those cells are in bounds. Let's test this.\n\nExample 0: 1 at (1,0). Left is invalid, above is (0,0). So (0,0) becomes 2. Correct.\n\nExample 1: 1s at (0,1) and (1,0). The 1 at (0,1) can spread left to (0,0), but not above. The 1 at (1,0) spreads above to (0,0). So (0,0) and (0,1) become 2s. Output matches.\n\nExample 2: 1s at (0,2) and (2,0). The 1 at (0,2) spreads left to (0,1) and (0,0). The 1 at (2,0) spreads above to (1,0) and (0,0). So combining, (0,0), (0,1), (1,0) should be 2. But output is [2,2,0], which only has (0,0) and (0,1). So (1,0) is 0. So this doesn't fit. Hmm. So maybe there's another rule.\n\nWait, maybe each 1 spreads a 2 to the cell directly above and all cells to the left in the same row. Let's see:\n\nExample 0: 1 at (1,0). Spreads to (0,0). Correct.\n\nExample 1: 1 at (0,1) spreads to (0,0) (left), and since it's in row 0, no above. The 1 at (1,0) spreads to (0,0). So (0,0) and (0,0) again. But output is [2,2,0]. Wait, (0,1) becomes 2. So maybe the 1 at (0,1) also turns into 2? But no, in the output, the 1s are replaced with 0. So perhaps the 1s in the input are replaced by 0, and the 2s are added based on some rule.\n\nWait, looking at the input and output for Example 0:\n\nInput has a 1 in (1,0). Output has that 1 replaced by 0 and a 2 in (0,0). So maybe each 1 is removed (turned to 0) and causes the cell above and to the left in the same row to become 2. Wait, but in Example 1, the input has 1 in (0,1) and (1,0). The 1 at (0,1) would have to spread left to (0,0), and the 1 at (1,0) would spread left (invalid) and above (0,0). So both lead to (0,0) and (0,1). That matches the output.\n\nIn Example 2, the 1 at (0,2) would spread left to (0,1) and (0,0). The 1 at (2,0) would spread above to (1,0) and (0,0). So combining, (0,0), (0,1), (1,0) become 2. But the output for Example 2 is [2,2,0], [0,0,0], ... So (1,0) is 0. That's a contradiction. So maybe the spread is only in the same column upwards and the same row to the left. But in Example 2, why is (1,0) not turned into 2?\n\nWait, looking at Example 2's input:\n\n[0, 0, 1]\n[0, 0, 0]\n[1, 0, 0]\n\nSo 1s at (0,2) and (2,0). The output is [2,2,0] in the first row, others 0.\n\nIf each 1 converts to 0 and spreads 2s to all cells to the left in their row and upwards in their column. Let's see:\n\nFor (0,2):\n\n- Left in row 0: (0,1), (0,0)\n- Up in column 2: none (since it's already row 0)\n\nSo 2s at (0,1), (0,0)\n\nFor (2,0):\n\n- Left in row 2: none (column 0)\n- Up in column 0: (1,0), (0,0)\n\nSo 2s at (1,0), (0,0)\n\nCombining all, (0,0), (0,1), (1,0). But the output's first row is [2,2,0], second row all 0. So (1,0) is 0. That doesn't fit. So maybe the spread is only to the left in the same row, not upwards. But then for (2,0), left is nothing, so no 2s. And (0,2) would spread left to (0,1) and (0,0). So output would have (0,0) and (0,1) as 2. Which matches the output of Example 2. But why does the 1 at (2,0) contribute? If the spread is only to the left in the same row, then the (2,0) 1 doesn't spread left (no columns left), so contributes nothing. Then the output would be [2,2,0] from the (0,2) 1. But what about the (2,0) 1? In the output, (0,0) is 2, but according to this, (0,0) is from (0,2)'s left spread. But in Example 0, the 1 at (1,0) spread to (0,0). So this idea isn't consistent.\n\nAlternative approach: Let's see if the number of 2s in the output corresponds to the number of 1s in the input. For Example 0, one 1 leads to one 2. Example 1, two 1s lead to two 2s. Example 2, two 1s lead to two 2s. Example 3, two 1s lead to two 2s. Example 4, one 1 leads to one 2. Example 5, three 1s (positions (0,0), (0,1), (2,0)) lead to three 2s. Wait, Example 5's output has three 2s in the first row. So the count matches. Example 6's input has three 1s (0,1;1,0;1,1), output has three 2s. Example 7's input has four 1s? Let's check: [1,1,0], [0,0,0], [1,0,1]. So three 1s in first row, one in third row: total four. Output has [2,2,2], [0,2,0], [0,0,0]. So four 2s. So the number of 2s equals the number of 1s. But wait, Example 7's output has four 2s. Input has four 1s. So yes, matches. Example 8's input has three 1s (0,1;1,0;1,1;2,0) \u2013 wait, no: input is [0,1,0], [1,1,0], [1,0,0]. So first row has 1, second row two, third row one: total four 1s. Output has [2,2,2], [0,2,0], [0,0,0]. So five 2s. Hmm, that doesn't fit. Wait, example 8's output: first row three 2s, second row one 2. Total four 2s. So same as input's four 1s. So the count matches.\n\nSo perhaps each 1 in the input is replaced by a 2 in some position. But how?\n\nAlternative idea: For each 1 in the input, add a 2 in the first row, leftmost possible column that's available. Wait, not sure.\n\nAnother angle: The output has all the 2s in the earliest possible rows. Like, they accumulate in the first row. Let's see:\n\nIn Example 0, the 1 is in row 1, column 0. Output has 2 in row 0, column 0.\n\nIn Example 1, 1s in row 0 column 1 and row 1 column 0. Output has 2s in row 0 columns 0 and 1.\n\nIn Example 2, 1s in row 0 column 2 and row 2 column 0. Output has 2s in row 0 columns 0 and 1.\n\nWait, why row 0 column 1 in Example 2? The 1 is in row 0 column 2. If the 2 is placed in the first available column to the left. So for each 1 in row r, column c, place a 2 in row 0, column (c - r) or something. Not sure.\n\nWait, in Example 2: 1 at (0,2) (row 0, column 2). Output's first row has 2s at columns 0 and 1. So maybe for each 1, the 2 is placed in row 0, column (c - r). For the 1 at (0,2), c - r is 2. But output has column 0 and 1. Hmm, that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternative approach: Looking at all the outputs, the 2s are in the first possible row, starting from the top, and filling to the left. For example, in Example 5, input has three 1s, output has first row all 2s. So perhaps each 1 contributes a 2 to the leftmost available position in the highest possible row.\n\nAlternatively, the pattern could involve the sum of the rows. Let me see:\n\nIn Example 0, input has one 1 in row 1. Output has a 2 in row 0, same column.\n\nExample 1: Two 1s in row 0 and row 1. Output has two 2s in row 0.\n\nExample 2: Two 1s in row 0 and row 2. Output has two 2s in row 0.\n\nSo maybe for each 1 in any row, a 2 is placed in the first row, same column. But if multiple 1s are in the same column, the 2 would be there once. But Example 5: input has 1s in (0,0), (0,1), (2,0). Output has 2s in columns 0, 1, 2. But the 2 in column 2 comes from the 1 in row 0 column 0? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each 1 in column c causes all cells in column c of the first row to be 2, but that doesn't explain Example 2. Because the 1 in column 2 of row 0 would make the first row column 2 a 2, but output for Example 2 is [2,2,0], so column 2 is 0. So that's not.\n\nAnother angle: Maybe the output is the sum of the 1s in each column, but capped at 2. But in Example 0, the sum of column 0 is 1, output is 2. No. Doesn't fit.\n\nWait, looking at Example 5's input:\n\n[1,1,0]\n[0,0,0]\n[1,0,0]\n\nOutput is [2,2,2]. So all first row columns 0,1,2 are 2. So there are three 1s in the input (columns 0,1,0). So maybe for each 1 in any row, the corresponding column in the first row is set to 2. But in Example 2, input has a 1 in column 2 (row 0), but the first row column 2 is 0. So that's conflicting.\n\nHmm. This is getting complicated. Let me think of another approach.\n\nLooking at Example 7:\n\nInput:\n\n[1,1,0]\n[0,0,0]\n[1,0,1]\n\nOutput:\n\n[2,2,2]\n[0,2,0]\n[0,0,0]\n\nSo input has 1s in (0,0), (0,1), (2,0), (2,2). Output has 4 2s. The first row is all 2s, second row has a 2 in column 1, and third row none. How does that happen?\n\nAnother idea: Maybe each 1 spreads a 2 to the cell above it, and if there's already a 2, it continues upwards. But if it's in the first row, it spreads to the left.\n\nWait, for Example 7:\n\nThe 1 at (0,0) is already in the first row. So spread to the left, but there's no left, so maybe the same cell? Or the 1 in (0,0) causes the cell above (invalid), so instead spreads to the left (but none) and maybe stays. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the 1s in the input are replaced by 0s, and the 2s are added in all cells that are to the left and/or in the same column but above the 1. But this is similar to earlier thoughts.\n\nLet me try to come up with a general rule.\n\nLooking at all examples, the 2s are in the same column as the 1s but in higher rows. For example, Example 0's 1 is in row 1, column 0 \u2192 2 in row 0, column 0. Example 1's 1 in row 1, column 0 \u2192 2 in row 0, column 0. The other 1 in row 0, column 1 \u2192 2 in row 0, column 1. So for a 1 in row r, column c, the output has a 2 in row r-1, column c. But if r=0, then it wraps around? No, because in Example 4, 1 is in row 0, column 2 \u2192 output has 2 in row 0, column 0. That doesn't fit.\n\nWait, in Example 4:\n\nInput:\n\n[0,0,1]\n[0,0,0]\n[0,0,0]\n\nOutput:\n\n[2,0,0]\n...\n\nSo the 1 is in row 0, column 2. Output's row 0, column 0 is 2. So how does that happen?\n\nThis suggests that the rule for a 1 in row 0 is different. Perhaps when a 1 is in row r, column c, it places a 2 in row r-1, column c-1. If r-1 is negative, use row 0. Or something.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 1s are converted into 2s in the row above, shifted left by one. For example, a 1 at (r,c) \u2192 2 at (r-1, c-1). If r-1 is negative, then it's row 2 (assuming wrapping), but in the examples, there's no wrapping.\n\nExample 0: (1,0) \u2192 (0,-1) which is invalid. But output is (0,0). Hmm, maybe shifted left but if out of bounds, place at the first possible column.\n\nAlternatively, for each 1, the 2 is placed at (r-1, c). If r-1 is negative, then place at the same column but row 0. Wait, for Example 4: 1 at (0,2). r-1 is -1 \u2192 row 0. So (0,2) \u2192 (0,2). But output is (0,0). Doesn't fit.\n\nThis is getting tricky. Let's look for a different pattern.\n\nPerhaps the output is the cumulative sum of each row from top to bottom, but with some transformation. Not sure.\n\nAnother idea: The output is such that each 2 is placed in the highest possible row (closest to the top) in the same column as the 1, but if that position is already occupied, move left.\n\nFor example, in Example 2, the 1s are in column 2 (row 0) and column 0 (row 2). The highest possible row for column 2 is row 0, but there's a 1 there. So maybe it moves left to column 1 and 0. The column 0 1 is in row 2, so highest possible row is row 0, column 0. So output would have 2s in (0,0) and (0,1). Which matches the output.\n\nSimilarly, Example 7's input has 1s in columns 0 (row 0), 1 (row 0), 0 (row 2), and 2 (row 2). The highest possible row for column 0 is row 0, column 0. But since there's a 1 there, maybe it moves left (but no, column 0 is the first). So perhaps in such cases, the 2 is placed in row 0, column 0. But the other 1s: column 1 row 0 \u2192 2 in row 0, column 1. Column 0 row 2: highest row 0, column 0 is taken, so move left, but can't. So maybe no. This seems too vague.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 2s are placed in the first row, filling from the left, one per 1 in the input. For example, each 1 in the input adds a 2 to the leftmost available spot in the first row.\n\nExample 0: one 1 \u2192 2 in leftmost (0,0).\n\nExample 1: two 1s \u2192 fill (0,0) and (0,1).\n\nExample 2: two 1s \u2192 fill (0,0) and (0,1).\n\nExample 3: two 1s \u2192 fill (0,0) and (0,1).\n\nExample 4: one 1 \u2192 (0,0).\n\nExample 5: three 1s \u2192 fill (0,0), (0,1), (0,2).\n\nExample 6: three 1s \u2192 fill first three positions.\n\nExample 7: four 1s \u2192 fill first three positions in row 0, then the next available in row 1.\n\nExample 8: four 1s \u2192 fill first three in row 0, then one in row 1.\n\nExample 9: four 1s (input has [1,0,0], [0,0,1], [0,1,1]. So total 1+1+2=4?), but output is [2,2,2], [0,2,0], ... so three in row 0, one in row 1. Yes, fits.\n\nSo the pattern is that for each 1 in the input, starting from the top row to the bottom, and left to right within each row, place a 2 in the first available position in the output matrix, filling the first row left to right, then the second row left to right, etc.\n\nLet's test this hypothesis.\n\nExample 0: one 1 \u2192 output's first cell (0,0) is 2.\n\nExample 1: two 1s \u2192 (0,0) and (0,1).\n\nExample 2: two 1s \u2192 (0,0) and (0,1), even though the 1s are in (0,2) and (2,0). The order is top to bottom, left to right. So the 1 in (0,2) is processed first, so places 2 in (0,0) (first available). Then the 1 in (2,0) places next 2 in (0,1). So output first row is [2,2,0].\n\nWait, but why would the first 1 in (0,2) fill (0,0) first? Because if we process the 1s in the order they appear in the input (row-wise), then the first 1 is at (0,2) in Example 2. Then the next is at (2,0).\n\nBut according to the filling rule, each 1 adds a 2 to the next available position in row-major order.\n\nSo the available positions in the output are filled left to right, top to bottom. Each 1 in the input (processed in row-major order) places a 2 in the next available position in the output.\n\nWait, let's imagine that. For each 1 in the input matrix, read row by row, left to right, and for each 1, place a 2 in the next available cell in the output matrix (row-major order), then turn the 1 in the input to 0.\n\nLet's see:\n\nExample 0:\n\nInput is:\n\nRow 0: [0,0,0]\n\nRow 1: [1,0,0]\n\nRow 2: [0,0,0]\n\nSo processing the 1 in (1,0). The output starts empty. Place 2 in the next available cell, which is (0,0). So output's (0,0) is 2. The rest are 0. Correct.\n\nExample 1:\n\nInput rows:\n\n0: [0,1,0]\n\n1: [1,0,0]\n\n2: [0,0,0]\n\nProcessing 1s in order: (0,1), then (1,0).\n\nFirst 1: place 2 in (0,0) \u2192 next available.\n\nSecond 1: place 2 in (0,1).\n\nSo output row 0: [2,2,0]. Correct.\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput rows:\n\n0: [0,0,1]\n\n1: [0,0,0]\n\n2: [1,0,0]\n\nProcessing 1s in order: (0,2) \u2192 first, then (2,0).\n\nNext available positions:\n\nFirst 1: (0,0) (since output starts empty) \u2192 2.\n\nSecond 1: next available is (0,1) \u2192 2.\n\nSo output row 0: [2,2,0]. Correct.\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput:\n\n0: [0,1,0]\n\n1: [0,0,1]\n\n2: [0,0,0]\n\nProcessing 1s at (0,1), (1,2). Place 2s in (0,0), (0,1). So output row 0: [2,2,0]. Correct.\n\nExample 4:\n\nInput has 1 at (0,2). Process it, place 2 in (0,0). Output [2,0,0]. Correct.\n\nExample 5:\n\nInput:\n\nRow 0: [1,1,0]\n\nRow 1: [0,0,0]\n\nRow 2: [1,0,0]\n\nProcessing 1s at (0,0), (0,1), (2,0).\n\nNext available positions:\n\nFirst 1: (0,0) \u2192 2.\n\nSecond 1: (0,1) \u2192 2.\n\nThird 1: (0,2) \u2192 2.\n\nOutput row 0: [2,2,2]. Correct.\n\nExample 7:\n\nInput:\n\nRow 0: [1,1,0]\n\nRow 1: [0,0,0]\n\nRow 2: [1,0,1]\n\nProcessing 1s at (0,0), (0,1), (2,0), (2,2).\n\nNext available positions:\n\nFirst 1: (0,0) \u2192 2.\n\nSecond 1: (0,1) \u2192 2.\n\nThird 1: (0,2) \u2192 2.\n\nFourth 1: (1,0) \u2192 2.\n\nSo output rows:\n\n[2,2,2]\n\n[2,0,0]\n\n[0,0,0]\n\nBut the actual output is [2,2,2], [0,2,0], [0,0,0]. So this contradicts. Hmm. So the fourth 1 in (2,0) would place a 2 in (1,0). But the example's output has (1,1) as 2. So this approach isn't correct.\n\nWait, Example 7's output has [2,2,2], [0,2,0]. So third row is all zeros. So the fourth 1 (at (2,2)) would place a 2 in (1,0)? But output has (1,1) as 2. So this doesn't fit.\n\nHmm, this approach works for most examples but fails in Example 7. So maybe there's a different order.\n\nWait, maybe the 1s are processed in reverse order? Or in some other order. Let's check Example 7.\n\nInput 1s are at positions:\n\n(0,0), (0,1), (2,0), (2,2). If we process them in row-major order, the order is (0,0), (0,1), (2,0), (2,2).\n\nAvailable output positions in row-major order:\n\n(0,0), (0,1), (0,2), (1,0), (1,1), (1,2), (2,0), etc.\n\nSo first 1 (0,0) \u2192 (0,0) is 2.\n\nSecond 1 (0,1) \u2192 (0,1) is 2.\n\nThird 1 (2,0) \u2192 (0,2) is 2.\n\nFourth 1 (2,2) \u2192 (1,0) is 2.\n\nBut the actual output for Example 7 is:\n\n[2,2,2]\n\n[0,2,0]\n\n...\n\nSo third 2 is at (0,2), fourth at (1,1). But according to this method, fourth 2 would be at (1,0). But in the output, (1,0) is 0 and (1,1) is 2. So this doesn't fit. So the hypothesis is incorrect.\n\nAlternative idea: Maybe the 2s are placed in the output such that for each 1 in the input, the number of 2s equals the number of 1s, and they are placed in the positions that are the earliest possible columns in each row, starting from the top. For example, each 1 adds a 2 to the first available column in the earliest row that has space.\n\nLet's see Example 7:\n\nFour 1s \u2192 four 2s. The first three go to row 0, columns 0,1,2. The fourth goes to row 1, column 0. But the output has row 1, column 1 as 2. So that doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. This is challenging. Let's try to think of another angle.\n\nLooking at the test input:\n\n[0,1,0]\n\n[0,0,0]\n\n[0,1,0]\n\nSo input has three 1s: (0,1), (2,1).\n\nAccording to the previous hypothesis where each 1 adds a 2 to the next available position in row-major order, the processing order would be (0,1) first, then (2,1). Let's see:\n\nFirst 1: place 2 in (0,0).\n\nSecond 1: place 2 in (0,1).\n\nThird 1: place 2 in (0,2).\n\nBut the output for the test case would then be:\n\n[2,2,2]\n\n[0,0,0]\n\n[0,0,0]\n\nBut I need to check what the correct output is based on the pattern.\n\nWait, according to the training examples, when there are two 1s, the output has two 2s in the first row. For example, Example 1, 2 1s \u2192 2 2s in first row. Example 2, two 1s \u2192 two 2s in first row. Example 3, two 1s \u2192 two 2s. So in the test case, two 1s \u2192 two 2s in first row.\n\nBut the test input has two 1s: (0,1) and (2,1). So according to the pattern observed in training examples, the output should have two 2s in the first row. Which columns? In Example 1, two 1s in (0,1) and (1,0) \u2192 first row [2,2,0]. So columns 0 and 1. In Example 2, 1s in (0,2) and (2,0) \u2192 output [2,2,0]. So columns 0 and 1. So regardless of the columns of the 1s, the output's first row fills the leftmost possible columns.\n\nSo the pattern seems to be: for each 1 in the input, regardless of its position, a 2 is added to the earliest possible cell in the first row, left to right. If the first row is filled, proceed to the second row, left to right, etc.\n\nThus, the number of 2s equals the number of 1s, and they are placed in the earliest positions in row-major order.\n\nSo for Example 7, which has four 1s, the first three 2s fill the first row (0,0), (0,1), (0,2), and the fourth fills (1,0). But the example's output has (1,1) as 2. So this doesn't fit. So perhaps the order is different.\n\nWait, Example 7's output is:\n\n[2,2,2]\n\n[0,2,0]\n\n[0,0,0]\n\nWhich has four 2s. The fourth 2 is at (1,1). So according to row-major order, after filling the first row, next is (1,0), but in the example, it's (1,1). So this hypothesis is invalid.\n\nAlternative idea: Maybe the 2s are placed in the output matrix such that each 1 in the input contributes a 2 to the cell that is in the same row as the 1 but as far left as possible. If that cell is already occupied, move down to the next row and as far left as possible.\n\nBut this is getting too vague.\n\nLet me think of the test input:\n\nTest Input:\n\n[0,1,0]\n\n[0,0,0]\n\n[0,1,0]\n\nSo two 1s. According to the training examples, the output should have two 2s in the first row, leftmost columns. So [2,2,0], rest zero. But let's check the training examples.\n\nExample 4 has one 1 in (0,2), output is [2,0,0]. So first available in first row. Example 1 has two 1s, output [2,2,0].\n\nSo for the test input, two 1s \u2192 two 2s in first row, columns 0 and 1. So output:\n\n[2,2,0]\n\n[0,0,0]\n\n[0,0,0]\n\nBut wait, the test input's 1s are in (0,1) and (2,1). According to the hypothesis where each 1 contributes a 2 to the earliest available position in the output matrix (row-major), then the first 1 (0,1) would place a 2 at (0,0), and the second 1 (2,1) would place at (0,1). So output first row [2,2,0], which matches. So that would be the expected output.\n\nLooking at Example 7, perhaps the input's 1s are processed in a different order. For example, if the 1s are processed from bottom to top, right to left. Let's see:\n\nExample 7's input is:\n\nRow 0: [1,1,0]\n\nRow 1: [0,0,0]\n\nRow 2: [1,0,1]\n\nProcessing order: (2,2), (2,0), (0,1), (0,0).\n\nBut this is just a guess. However, the output has (1,1) as 2. So it's unclear.\n\nPerhaps the correct pattern is to count the number of 1s and place that many 2s in the earliest positions of the output matrix, filling row-wise. This seems to fit all examples except Example 7. But Example 7's output has four 2s, which equals the four 1s in the input, and they are placed in (0,0), (0,1), (0,2), and (1,1). So according to this hypothesis, the fourth 2 should be in (1,0), but it's in (1,1). So there's a discrepancy.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 2s are placed diagonally. For example, the first 2 is at (0,0), the second at (0,1), third at (0,2), fourth at (1,1), fifth at (1,2), etc. This would explain Example 7's fourth 2 at (1,1). Let's test:\n\nExample 7's 1s are four. So 2s at (0,0), (0,1), (0,2), (1,1). Which matches the output. So how would this ordering work? It's a diagonal fill, but not sure. For example, processing in order (0,0), (0,1), (0,2), (1,1), (1,2), etc.\n\nIf this is the case, then for each 1 in the input, regardless of position, the 2s are filled in the order of columns in a diagonal manner. But how to determine the order.\n\nAlternatively, the 2s are filled in a way that each new 2 is placed in the next column of the current row until it's full, then move to the next row, but in a way that for each row, the columns are filled in reverse order. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the 2s are placed in the following order:\n\nRow 0: columns 0, 1, 2\n\nRow 1: columns 1, 0, 2\n\nRow 2: columns 2, 1, 0\n\nBut this seems too arbitrary.\n\nBut in Example 7, the four 2s are at (0,0), (0,1), (0,2), (1,1). The fourth position would be (1,1) if after row 0 is filled, the next positions are row 1, column 1. That seems odd.\n\nAlternatively, the 2s are filled in the order of the columns in a zig-zag pattern. For example, row 0 left to right, row 1 right to left, row 2 left to right, etc. But in Example 7, after filling row 0, row 1 would be filled from right to left. So fourth 2 would be (1,2), but in the output it's (1,1). So not matching.\n\nThis is really tricky. Given the time I've spent and the examples, the most consistent pattern I can find is that the number of 2s equals the number of 1s, and they are placed in the earliest possible positions in row-major order (left to right, top to bottom). This works for all examples except Example 7, but perhaps there's a mistake in my analysis of Example 7.\n\nWait, let's recheck Example 7:\n\nInput:\n\nRow 0: [1,1,0]\n\nRow 1: [0,0,0]\n\nRow 2: [1,0,1]\n\nProcessing order of 1s (row-major):\n\n(0,0), (0,1), (2,0), (2,2).\n\nSo first three 2s are placed in (0,0), (0,1), (0,2). Fourth 2 is placed in (1,0). But the output has fourth 2 at (1,1). So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 1s are processed in reverse row-major order. So starting from the last row, right to left.\n\nExample 7's 1s in reverse row-major order: (2,2), (2,0), (0,1), (0,0).\n\nFirst 2 at (0,0), then (0,1), then (0,2), then (1,0). But output has (1,1). So no.\n\nAlternatively, the processing order is column-major. Process columns left to right, top to bottom.\n\nExample 7's 1s:\n\nColumn 0: (0,0), (2,0)\n\nColumn 1: (0,1)\n\nColumn 2: (2,2)\n\nProcessing order: (0,0), (2,0), (0,1), (2,2).\n\nPlacing 2s in row-major order:\n\nFirst (0,0), then (0,1), then (0,2), then (1,0). So again, output would have (1,0) as 2, but in the example it's (1,1). So no.\n\nThis suggests that the pattern is not simply filling row-major. So I must be missing something.\n\nLet me look at Example 7's output:\n\n[2,2,2]\n\n[0,2,0]\n\n[0,0,0]\n\nSo four 2s. How does the input's four 1s lead to this?\n\nThe input 1s are at (0,0), (0,1), (2,0), (2,2). The output has 2s in (0,0), (0,1), (0,2), (1,1).\n\nHmm. The (0,2) and (1,1) positions. How could they be derived from the input 1s?\n\nAnother Idea: Maybe for each 1 at (r,c), the 2 is placed at (r', c') where r' = r - (c), c' = c - r. If that's possible. For example:\n\nExample 0: (1,0) \u2192 r' = 1 -0 =1? No. Or perhaps some other formula.\n\nAlternatively, each 1 contributes a 2 at (r - c, c - r) modulo the matrix size. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the 2s are placed in the positions that are the sum of the row and column of the 1. For example, for a 1 at (r,c), place a 2 at (r - (c - r), ...). Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, for each 1, the 2 is placed in the first row at column (c - r) mod 3. For example, Example 0: r=1, c=0 \u2192 (0 - (1)) = -1 mod 3 \u2192 2. So column 2. But output is column 0. So no.\n\nAlternatively, for each 1 at (r,c), the 2 is placed at (0, (c - r) mod 3).\n\nExample 0: (1,0) \u2192 (0, (0-1) mod 3) = (0,2). But output is column 0. Doesn't fit.\n\nAnother Idea: Maybe the output matrix is the sum of all the 1s' rows and columns mapped to the first row. For example, each 1's column is added to the first row's corresponding column, but this doesn't explain Example 0.\n\nAlternatively, the output is a bitwise OR of all the rows in the input. But no.\n\nAfter much consideration, the only pattern that seems to fit most examples is that the 2s are placed in the earliest available positions in row-major order, one per 1 in the input, regardless of the 1's position. This works for all examples except Example 7. However, perhaps Example 7's output is a mistake, but that's unlikely.\n\nWait, let's recheck Example 7's input and output:\n\nInput:\n\n[1,1,0]\n\n[0,0,0]\n\n[1,0,1]\n\nOutput:\n\n[2,2,2]\n\n[0,2,0]\n\n[0,0,0]\n\nSo four 1s \u2192 four 2s.\n\nAccording to the row-major fill:\n\nFirst three 1s would fill row 0: (0,0), (0,1), (0,2). The fourth 1 would fill (1,0). But output has (1,1) as 2. So this contradicts.\n\nBut wait, maybe the processing order of the 1s is different. If the 1s are processed from bottom to top and left to right:\n\nIn Example 7, the 1s are at (2,0), (2,2), (0,0), (0,1).\n\nProcessing order: (2,0) \u2192 2 at (0,0).\n\nThen (2,2) \u2192 2 at (0,1).\n\nThen (0,0) \u2192 2 at (0,2).\n\nThen (0,1) \u2192 2 at (1,0).\n\nBut output has (1,1) as 2. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 2s are placed in the output matrix's diagonal. For example, for the first 1, (0,0), second (0,1), third (1,0), fourth (1,1), etc. But this would require a specific order of processing.\n\nAlternatively, the 2s are placed in the output such that each subsequent 2 is placed in the next diagonal position. For example:\n\n1st 2: (0,0)\n\n2nd: (0,1)\n\n3rd: (1,0)\n\n4th: (0,2)\n\n5th: (1,1)\n\n6th: (2,0)\n\netc.\n\nBut in Example 7, four 2s would be at (0,0), (0,1), (1,0), (0,2). But the output has (0,0), (0,1), (0,2), (1,1). So this doesn't fit.\n\nI'm really stuck here. Let's try to think of another approach. Looking at the output matrices, they all have 2s only in the upper part, and the rest are 0s. Maybe the 2s are placed in the highest possible row, leftmost possible column, for each 1, considering overlaps.\n\nFor example, each 1 tries to place its 2 as high as possible, left as possible, and if that cell is taken, move right or down.\n\nBut how to determine the order.\n\nAlternatively, the output is a heatmap where each 1 in the input contributes to 2s in all cells to the left and above it. But if that's the case, overlapping areas would have multiple 2s, but in the examples, each cell is either 0 or 2. So maybe it's binary: if any 1 contributes to that cell, it's 2.\n\nThis would explain Example 0: 1 at (1,0) contributes to (0,0). So output is 2 there.\n\nExample 1: 1 at (0,1) contributes to (0,0) and (0,1). 1 at (1,0) contributes to (0,0). So (0,0) and (0,1) are 2s.\n\nExample 2: 1 at (0,2) contributes to (0,0), (0,1), (0,2). 1 at (2,0) contributes to (0,0), (1,0). So combining, (0,0), (0,1), (0,2), (1,0). But output is [2,2,0], [0,0,0]. So this doesn't fit. Unless there's a rule that only the leftmost or highest cells are considered.\n\nAlternatively, each 1 contributes to the cell immediately above and to the left, but only once. For example, each 1 adds a 2 to the cell directly above and the cell to the left in the same row, but this would explain some examples but not others.\n\nBut in Example 2, the 1 at (0,2) would add to left cells (0,1), (0,0). The 1 at (2,0) would add to above cells (1,0), (0,0). So combining, (0,0), (0,1), (1,0). But output is (0,0), (0,1). So why is (1,0) not 2?\n\nThis suggests that only certain directions are considered. Maybe only left in the same row, and up in the same column. But how to explain the output.\n\nAlternatively, each 1 contributes to the cell above it. If there's no cell above, contributes to the cell to the left. If both are possible, choose up first.\n\nExample 0: 1 at (1,0) \u2192 above is (0,0).\n\nExample 1: 1 at (0,1) \u2192 no above, so left (0,0). 1 at (1,0) \u2192 above (0,0). So both contribute to (0,0) and (0,0). So output (0,0) and (0,1) (wait, maybe both contribute to their own directions). Not sure.\n\nThis is getting too time-consuming. Given the time I have, I'll have to make an educated guess based on the majority of examples.\n\nThe test input has two 1s. Following the pattern of Examples 1 and 2, the output should have two 2s in the first row, leftmost columns. So the output would be:\n\n[2, 2, 0]\n\n[0, 0, 0]\n\n[0, 0, 0]\n\nBut I need to check if this fits any other examples with similar structure.\n\nLooking at Example 4:\n\nInput: [0,0,1] in row 0. Output: [2,0,0]. So the 1 in row 0, column 2 results in a 2 in column 0 of the first row. This suggests that the leftmost available position in the first row is filled, regardless of the column of the 1. So each 1 adds a 2 to the first available spot in the first row, left to right.\n\nThus, for the test input, two 1s would fill the first two positions in the first row. So the output is:\n\n[2, 2, 0]\n\n[0, 0, 0]\n\n[0, 0, 0]\n\nBut I need to see if this matches any other examples. Yes, Example 1 and 2 have two 1s leading to two 2s in the first row's first two columns. Example 4 has one 1 leading to one 2 in the first column.\n\nSo applying this pattern to the test input, the answer should be:\n\n[2, 2, 0]\n\n[0, 0, 0]\n\n[0, 0, 0]",

        "cot_2": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. So, we have these 3x3 grids with 0s and 1s in the input, and they turn into grids with 0s and 2s in the output. Let's look at the examples to see what's happening.\n\nStarting with Example 0:\nInput:\n[0,0,0]\n[1,0,0]\n[0,0,0]\nOutput:\n[2,0,0]\n[0,0,0]\n[0,0,0]\nThe 1 in the middle of the first column (second row) becomes a 2 in the top-left corner. Hmm, maybe it's moving up? But how?\n\nExample 1:\nInput:\n[0,1,0]\n[1,0,0]\n[0,0,0]\nOutput:\n[2,2,0]\n[0,0,0]\n[0,0,0]\nHere, there's a 1 in the first row middle and second row first. The output has two 2s in the first row. So perhaps each 1 is moving up and maybe to the left or right?\n\nWait, maybe the 1s are being replaced by 2s in the cells above them. Like, each 1 in a lower row causes the cell above to become a 2. Let's check.\n\nIn Example 0, the 1 is in the second row, first column. The output has a 2 in the first row, first column. So that's directly above. Makes sense. But in Example 1, the first 1 is in row 1 (second row), column 0 (first column), and the other 1 is in row 0 (first row), column 1. The output has 2s in row 0, columns 0 and 1. So the 1 in row 1, column 0 causes the cell above (row 0, column 0) to become 2. The 1 in row 0, column 1, maybe it's already at the top, so where does it go? Maybe it's moving up but since it's already at the top, maybe it affects neighboring cells? Wait, in the output for Example 1, both columns 0 and 1 in row 0 are 2s. So the 1 in row 0, column 1 might be causing the cell to the left (column 0) to become 2. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe each 1 is transformed into a 2 in the cell above it. If a 1 is in the top row, then maybe it affects the cell to the left. Let's see.\n\nWait, Example 4's input is [0,0,1] in the first row. The output is [2,0,0]. So the 1 is in column 2 of row 0. The output has a 2 in column 0 of row 0. That's a big jump. How does that happen? If the 1 is in the top row, maybe it wraps around? Like, moving left three times or something? That doesn't make sense. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are placed in positions based on the sum of the directions from the 1s. Wait, perhaps it's some kind of cellular automaton where each 1 spreads a 2 in certain directions. Let's think of each 1 as \"activating\" certain cells above or around it.\n\nLooking at Example 2:\nInput:\n[0,0,1]\n[0,0,0]\n[1,0,0]\nOutput:\n[2,2,0]\n[0,0,0]\n[0,0,0]\nThe 1s are in row 2, column 0 and row 0, column 2. The output has 2s in row 0, columns 0 and 1. The bottom 1 (row 2, column 0) would affect the cell above it (row 1, column 0) but that's 0. Then the next above is row 0, column 0. So maybe each 1 propagates upwards, turning the cell above into 2. If there's already a 1 or 2, maybe it continues. But in Example 0, the 1 in row 1, column 0 causes row 0, column 0 to become 2. So that's one step up. For the 1 in row 2, column 0 (Example 2), it would propagate up two steps (to row 1 and then row 0). But in the output, row 0, column 0 is 2, which would be two steps up. But how does that work? Let me check:\n\nIn Example 2's input, the 1 in row 2, column 0. So moving up each step, maybe each 1 creates a 2 in the cell directly above, and then that 2 might propagate further? But in the output, all the 2s are in the first row. Wait, in the output of Example 2, row 0 has 2s in columns 0 and 1. Hmm, maybe when a 1 is in a lower row, it affects the cell above it, and if that cell is in the top row, it spreads to the left and right?\n\nAlternatively, maybe each 1 adds a 2 in the top row, but the column depends on the original column. For example, a 1 in any row in column x causes a 2 in the top row, column x. But that doesn't explain Example 1, where there's a 1 in column 1 of row 0 and column 0 of row 1, leading to 2s in columns 0 and 1 of row 0.\n\nWait, in Example 1, input has 1s at (0,1) and (1,0). The output has 2s at (0,0) and (0,1). So if each 1 in column x of any row causes the top row's column x to become 2, then the 1 at (0,1) would already be in the top row, so maybe it stays, but in the output, there's a 2 in (0,0) and (0,1). So maybe when a 1 is in the top row, it also affects the cell to the left. But in Example 4, the input is [0,0,1] (row 0, column 2), and the output is [2,0,0]. So that would mean the 1 in column 2 of the top row causes the top row's column 0 to become 2. That's a big jump. How?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 1s are being counted, and the output's top row is the count of 1s in each column. Wait, let's check.\n\nExample 0: input columns:\n\nColumn 0: 1 (second row)\nColumns 1 and 2: 0s.\nOutput top row is [2,0,0]. If columns 0's count is 1, but output is 2. Doesn't fit.\n\nAnother idea: Maybe it's related to the positions of 1s, and the output is the sum of their row inverses or something. Not sure.\n\nWait, looking at Example 7's input:\n[1,1,0]\n[0,0,0]\n[1,0,1]\nOutput:\n[2,2,2]\n[0,2,0]\n[0,0,0]\nSo input has 1s in (0,0), (0,1), (2,0), (2,2). The output has 2s in the entire top row and middle row's column 1. How does that happen?\n\nAlternatively, maybe each 1 is \"filling\" the cells above it in the same column, but wrapping around if necessary. Wait, in Example 7, the 1s in row 2, columns 0 and 2 would fill up rows 1 and 0 in their columns. So for column 0, rows 2 and 0 have 1s. So maybe each 1 in a column propagates upwards, turning all cells above into 2s. So if there's a 1 in row 2, column 0, then rows 1 and 0 in column 0 become 2. But in the output, the top row of column 0 is 2, but middle row column 0 is 0. Wait, that doesn't fit. Hmm.\n\nWait, let's re-examine Example 7's output. The top row is all 2s. The middle row has a 2 in column 1. The input has 1s in (0,0), (0,1), (2,0), (2,2). So maybe the 1s in row 0, columns 0 and 1, and row 2, columns 0 and 2. The output's top row has all 2s, which could be because any 1 in any row of a column causes the top row's column to be 2. But then, the middle row's column 1 has a 2. Where does that come from?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 2s are placed in all cells that are in the same row as any 1, but shifted up by the number of rows between the 1 and the top. For example, a 1 in row 2 (third row) would affect cells two rows up (which is row 0) and maybe adjacent cells. But I'm not sure.\n\nLooking at Example 8:\nInput:\n[0,1,0]\n[1,1,0]\n[1,0,0]\nOutput:\n[2,2,2]\n[0,2,0]\n[0,0,0]\nThe input has 1s in (0,1), (1,0), (1,1), (2,0). The output's top row is all 2s. Middle row has 2 in column 1. So perhaps each 1 in the input contributes to the top row's columns based on their original positions. Maybe the sum of the columns for each row, but how?\n\nAlternatively, think of it as each 1 \"lights up\" certain cells in the output. For example, a 1 in row i, column j might cause the cell in row 0 (top), column (j - i) mod 3 to become 2. Let's test this.\n\nIn Example 0: the 1 is at (1,0) (second row, first column). So i=1, j=0. Then (j - i) mod 3 = (0 -1) mod3 = 2. So column 2. But the output has 2 in column 0. Doesn't fit.\n\nAlternative: j + i. For Example 0: 0 +1 =1. But output has 2 in column 0.\n\nHmm. Maybe it's the column index shifted by the row. For example, a 1 in row i, column j affects the column (j - i) in the top row. Let's test.\n\nExample 0: i=1, j=0. (0 -1) = -1 mod3 is 2. Output column 0. Not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each 1's column is added to its row number, mod 3. Example 0: 0 (column) +1 (row) =1 mod3. Output column 0. Doesn't fit.\n\nAnother approach: Let's look at the positions of the 1s and where the 2s are in the output. For example:\n\nIn Example 0, input 1 is at (1,0). Output 2 is at (0,0).\n\nExample 1: 1s at (0,1) and (1,0). Output 2s at (0,0) and (0,1).\n\nExample 2: 1s at (0,2) and (2,0). Output 2s at (0,0), (0,1).\n\nExample 3: 1s at (0,1) and (1,2). Output 2s at (0,0), (0,1).\n\nExample4: 1 at (0,2). Output 2 at (0,0).\n\nExample5: 1s at (0,0), (0,1), (2,0). Output all top row 2s.\n\nExample6: 1s at (0,1), (1,0), (1,1). Output top row all 2s.\n\nHmm, trying to find a pattern. It seems that when a 1 is present in any row, the top row's columns are being set to 2 based on some relation. For example, in Example4, a single 1 at (0,2) leads to a 2 at (0,0). So maybe it's the sum of the columns of the 1s in some way. For instance, in Example4, the 1 is at column 2. 2 mod3 is 2, but 2+ something is 0. Wait, maybe the sum of all the columns of the 1s, multiplied by their row index plus one, mod3.\n\nAlternatively, maybe for each 1, the output's top row gets a 2 in the position (original column - row) mod3.\n\nTesting this:\n\nExample0: 1 at (1,0). 0 -1 = -1 mod3=2. But output is [2,0,0], so column0. Doesn't fit.\n\nExample1: 1s at (0,1) and (1,0). For (0,1): 1-0=1. For (1,0):0-1=-1=2 mod3. So output columns 1 and 2. But the output has 2s in columns0 and1. Hmm, no.\n\nWait, perhaps the top row's 2s are at columns equal to (original column + row) mod3.\n\nFor Example0: 0 +1=1 mod3. So column1, but output is column0. No.\n\nExample1: (0,1):1+0=1, (1,0):0+1=1. So columns1. But output has columns0 and1. Not matching.\n\nAnother angle: Let's look at how many 2s are in the output for each example. For example:\n\n- Example0: 1.\n- Example1: 2.\n- Example2:2.\n- Example3:2.\n- Example4:1.\n- Example5:3.\n- Example6:3.\n- Example7: top row 3 and middle 1 (total 4).\n- Example8: top 3 and middle 1.\n- Example9: top3 and middle1.\n\nHmm, maybe the number of 2s in the top row is equal to the number of columns covered by the 1s in all rows. But in Example0, only column0 has a 1, so top row column0 becomes 2. That fits. Example1 has 1s in column0 and1, so top row has both 0 and1 as 2. That fits. Example2 has 1s in column2 and0. Top row has 0 and1 as 2. Wait, that doesn't fit. Column2 and0, but output columns0 and1. Hmm.\n\nWait, Example2's input has 1s at (0,2) and (2,0). The output is [2,2,0]. So columns0 and1. How does that relate to the 1s' columns?\n\nAlternative idea: Maybe each 1 in the input affects the top row's columns based on some movement. For example, a 1 in row i, column j moves up i rows and to the left j times. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, think of the output as the sum of all possible paths each 1 can take upwards, but wrapping around if needed. For instance, a 1 in row 2, column0 would move up two steps, which is row0, column0. But in Example2, there's a 1 in row2, column0, which would end up in row0, column0. The other 1 is in row0, column2. Since it can't move up further, maybe it moves left in the top row. So 0 steps up (since already in top row) and then left 2 steps? But column2 -2 would be column0. So that would set column0 to 2. But in Example2's output, column0 and1 are 2. How does that happen?\n\nWait, maybe when a 1 is in the top row, it spreads to the left. For example, a 1 in column x of the top row turns into 2s from column0 up to columnx. But in Example4, input is [0,0,1] in row0, so column2. Output is [2,0,0]. So that would mean spreading from column0 to column2, but the output has only column0 as 2. Doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each 1 in the top row's column x causes the column (x-1) mod3 to be set to 2. So column2-1=1, but Example4's output is column0. Not matching.\n\nAlternatively, think of each 1 as a \"source\" that creates a 2 in the top row at a certain position, and if that position is already a 2, it spreads to adjacent cells.\n\nBut this is getting complicated. Let's try to find a rule that can explain all examples.\n\nLooking at Example4 again: input [0,0,1] (row0, column2). Output [2,0,0]. So the 1 in row0, column2 results in a 2 in column0. So column2 to column0. That's a difference of -2, or +1 mod3.\n\nHmm, maybe for each 1 in row i, column j, the corresponding 2 in the top row is at column (j - i) mod3. Let's test this.\n\nExample0: i=1, j=0. (0-1) mod3= 2. But output is column0. Doesn't match.\n\nExample1: first 1 is (0,1): (1-0)=1 mod3=1. Second 1 is (1,0): (0-1)= -1=2 mod3. So columns1 and2. But output has columns0 and1. Hmm, no.\n\nExample2: 1s at (0,2) and (2,0). For (0,2): (2-0)=2. For (2,0): (0-2)= -2=1 mod3. So columns2 and1. Output has 2s in 0 and1. Doesn't fit.\n\nAlternative idea: For each 1 in row i, column j, the top row's column (j + i) mod3 is set to 2.\n\nExample0: (1,0): (0+1)=1 mod3=1. Output column0. No.\n\nExample1: (0,1):1+0=1. (1,0):0+1=1. So column1. Output has 0 and1. No.\n\nAnother approach: Let's think of the output as the maximum possible positions covered by moving each 1 upwards and diagonally left. For example, a 1 in row i, column j can move up i times, each time moving left. So for a 1 in row1, column0: moving up once, left 0 steps. So column0. For a 1 in row2, column0: move up twice, each time left 0 steps. Ends at column0. But in Example2, the 1 in row2, column0 would end at column0, and the 1 in row0, column2: can't move up, so maybe move left two steps (from column2 to 0). So both would end at column0, but output has columns0 and1. Not sure.\n\nWait, in Example2's output, columns0 and1 are 2. So how does the 1 in row0, column2 contribute to column1? Maybe moving left from column2 once. But why?\n\nAlternatively, when a 1 is in the top row, it spreads to the left. So column2 becomes column1 and 0. But in Example4, the 1 is in column2, and output has only column0. That doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, the number of 2s in the top row is equal to the number of 1s in the input. But in Example0, there's one 1 and one 2. Example1 has two 1s and two 2s. That holds. Example2 has two 1s and two 2s. Example4 has one 1 and one 2. Example5 has three 1s and three 2s. Example7 has four 1s and three 2s in the top row plus another in the middle. Hmm, so that breaks.\n\nWait, maybe each 1 contributes to a certain number of 2s. For example, a 1 in row i contributes (i +1) 2s. But in Example0, i=1, so 2 2s, but output has one. Doesn't fit.\n\nAnother angle: The output grid's 2s are determined by the positions that are reachable by moving up from each 1, moving left each time. For example:\n\nEach 1 can move up as many times as possible. Each move up takes one step. For each step up, you can also move left once. So a 1 in row2, column0 can move up two steps (to row0) and move left two times (from column0 to 1 then 2 mod3). But this doesn't fit the examples.\n\nAlternatively, each 1 can move up any number of times, and for each step up, you can move left once. So the final position after moving up i steps and left i steps. For a 1 in row i, column j, the top row position would be (j - i) mod3. Let's test.\n\nExample0: i=1, j=0: 0-1= -1=2 mod3. Output is column0. Doesn't fit.\n\nExample4: i=0, j=2: 2-0=2 mod3. Output is column0. Doesn't fit.\n\nHmm.\n\nMaybe the direction is different. For each 1, when moving up, you also move left. So a 1 in row i, column j would end up in column (j - (i)) mod3. Let's see.\n\nExample0: (1,0): 0 -1 =-1=2. Output column0. No.\n\nExample4: (0,2): 2-0=2. Output column0. Doesn't fit.\n\nThis is getting frustrating. Let's try a different approach. Maybe the output's top row is the sum of all the rows of the input's 1s. For example, each 1 in row i contributes to the top row's column j based on some function.\n\nAlternatively, the output's 2s are the cells that are \"visible\" from any 1 by moving up and left. For example, a 1 at (i,j) can see all cells (k, j - (i -k)) for k from 0 to i. So for each 1 in row i, column j, in the output, the cells above it in the same column and diagonally left would be 2s.\n\nBut I'm not sure. Let's take Example0: 1 at (1,0). Moving up, the cell above is (0,0), which becomes 2. So that works.\n\nExample1: 1s at (0,1) and (1,0). The (0,1) is already at the top, so it contributes to (0,1). The (1,0) contributes to (0,0). So output has 2s at (0,0) and (0,1). Which matches.\n\nExample2: 1s at (0,2) and (2,0). The (0,2) contributes to (0,2). But output has 2s at (0,0) and (0,1). Wait, this doesn't fit. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe when a 1 is in the top row, it also causes the cells to the left in the top row to become 2s. So (0,2) would set (0,2), (0,1), (0,0) to 2. But in Example2's output, the top row is [2,2,0]. So only up to column1. So maybe each 1 in the top row fills all cells to the left up to a certain point. For example, the number of cells filled equals the row index of the original 1. But the row is already 0. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, a 1 in the top row fills all cells to the left of its column. For example, (0,2) would fill columns 0,1,2. But the output is [2,2,0], which doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, a 1 in row i fills i+1 cells to the left in the top row. For example:\n\nExample0: row1 (i=1) -> 2 cells. But output has 1 cell.\n\nHmm. Not helpful.\n\nLooking back at Example2's input: 1s at (0,2) and (2,0). Output is [2,2,0]. So the 1 in (0,2) would contribute to (0,2) and maybe (0,1). The 1 in (2,0) would contribute to (0,0) and (0,2) (if moving up two steps, each step moving left once). Wait, from (2,0), moving up two steps: each step up and left. So first step up to row1, left to column2. Second step up to row0, left to column1. So the 1 at (2,0) would affect row0, columns1 and possibly others. But the output is [2,2,0]. So columns0 and1.\n\nWait, maybe each 1 at (i,j) creates a 2 in the top row at column (j - i) mod3. Let's try that:\n\nFor Example2:\n\n- (0,2): j=2, i=0: 2-0=2 mod3. So column2. But output has 0 in column2. Doesn't fit.\n\n- (2,0): j=0, i=2: 0-2 =-2 mod3=1. So column1. So output would have columns1 and2 (from the two 1s). But actual output is columns0 and1. So this doesn't work.\n\nAlternatively, (j + i) mod3:\n\n(0,2) \u2192 2+0=2 mod3 \u2192 column2.\n\n(2,0) \u21920+2=2 mod3 \u2192 column2. So output would have column2, but it's 0. So no.\n\nHmm. Maybe the 2s in the top row are the sum of the columns of the 1s, each adjusted by their row. For example, each 1 in row i, column j contributes to (j - i) in the top row. Then, for each column in the top row, if there's at least one contribution to that column, it becomes a 2.\n\nExample0: (1,0) contributes to (0-1)= -1 \u2192 2 mod3. So top row column2. But output is column0. No.\n\nAlternative: Maybe each 1 in row i, column j contributes to column (j + i) mod3 in the top row.\n\nExample0: (1,0) \u21920+1=1. So column1. Output is column0. No.\n\nExample2: (0,2)\u21922+0=2. (2,0)\u21920+2=2. So column2. Output has 0 there. No.\n\nThis isn't working.\n\nLet me think differently. The output always has 0s except for the top row and sometimes the middle row. Looking at Example7, the output has 2s in the middle row, column1. How does that happen?\n\nExample7's input has 1s at (0,0), (0,1), (2,0), (2,2). The output's middle row, column1 has a 2. Maybe that's because there's a 1 in (2,0) and (2,2) which, when moving up, their paths cross at middle row, column1.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the middle row's 2s are caused by 1s directly below them. Like, a 1 in row2, column1 would affect the middle row. But there's no such 1 in Example7.\n\nAlternatively, the middle row's 2s are from 1s two rows below. For example, a 1 in row2, column1 would affect the middle row (row1) column1. But in Example7, there's a 1 in row2, column2. Hmm.\n\nThis is really tricky. Let's try to find another pattern.\n\nLooking at all examples, the output's top row seems to be the main focus. Let's list the top row outputs and see:\n\nExample0: [2,0,0]\n\nExample1: [2,2,0]\n\nExample2: [2,2,0]\n\nExample3: [2,2,0]\n\nExample4: [2,0,0]\n\nExample5: [2,2,2]\n\nExample6: [2,2,2]\n\nExample7: [2,2,2]\n\nExample8: [2,2,2]\n\nExample9: [2,2,2]\n\nSo the top row often has 2s in consecutive columns starting from 0. For example, Example0 has 1 2, Examples1-4 have 2 2s, Examples5-9 have 3.\n\nSo perhaps the number of 2s in the top row depends on the maximum number of 1s in any single row of the input. For example:\n\nExample0: 1 in row1 \u2192 1 2 \u2192 but output has 1.\n\nExample1: two 1s (row0 and row1) \u2192 output has 2 2s.\n\nExample5: three 1s \u2192 output has 3.\n\nBut Example2 has two 1s \u2192 output has two. So that fits.\n\nBut Example3 has two 1s \u2192 output two. So that's a possible pattern.\n\nBut wait, Example4 has one 1 \u2192 output one.\n\nExample6 has three 1s \u2192 output three 2s.\n\nExample7 has four 1s \u2192 output three 2s in top row. Hmm, this breaks.\n\nSo that's not it.\n\nAnother idea: The output's top row is filled with 2s from the left up to the number of 1s in the input. For example:\n\nExample0: 1 \u2192 [2,0,0].\n\nExample1:2 \u2192 [2,2,0].\n\nExample5:3 \u2192 all 2s.\n\nBut Example7 has four 1s but top row is all 2s. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, the top row has as many 2s as the number of 1s in the input. Example0:1 \u21921 2. Example1:2 \u21922. Example2:2 \u21922. Example5:3 \u21923. Example7:4 \u21923. Doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. Let's think of the output's top row as a binary representation where each 1 in the input contributes to a certain bit. But with 3 columns, it's more like a ternary system. Not sure.\n\nAnother approach: Let's look at the test input:\n\nTest Input:\n[0,1,0]\n[0,0,0]\n[0,1,0]\n\nSo there are two 1s: row0, column1 and row2, column1.\n\nWhat would be the output? Let's see.\n\nIf the pattern is that each 1 contributes to the top row's column based on its row and column:\n\nFor example, for the 1 at (0,1): since it's already in the top row, perhaps it affects the column to the left. So column0. For the 1 at (2,1): moving up two rows, so column (1 -2) mod3 = ( -1) mod3=2. So top row columns0 and2. But maybe also adjacent cells.\n\nAlternatively, if each 1 in row i, column j causes the top row's columns (j -i) mod3 and (j -i +1) mod3 to become 2. Let's test:\n\nFor the test input:\n\n1 at (0,1): i=0, j=1 \u2192 (1-0)=1 and 2 mod3. So columns1 and2.\n\n1 at (2,1): i=2, j=1 \u2192 (1-2) =-1=2 mod3, and 2+1=3 mod3=0. So columns2 and0.\n\nSo combining, columns0,1,2 would all be 2. So the output's top row would be [2,2,2].\n\nBut looking at similar examples, like Example6:\n\nInput has 1s at (0,1), (1,0), (1,1). Output top row all 2s. So maybe when there's a 1 in row0, column1 and another in row2, column1, their combined effect covers all columns.\n\nBut according to the previous hypothesis, the test input's output would have top row [2,2,2]. But let's check if any of the training examples fit this.\n\nExample5's input has 1s in row0 (0,0), (0,1), and row2 (2,0). The output's top row is all 2s.\n\nSimilarly, the test input has two 1s that might combine to cover all three columns. But how?\n\nAlternatively, each 1 in row i, column j contributes to (j -i) mod3 and (j -i +1) mod3. So for (0,1): 1 mod3 and 2 mod3 \u2192 columns1 and2. For (2,1): (1-2)= -1=2 mod3 and 2+1=0 mod3 \u2192 columns2 and0. So combined, all columns. So the top row becomes all 2s. Then, what about the middle row? Looking at Example7 and others, sometimes the middle row has 2s. For instance, Example7's output has a 2 in row1, column1. How?\n\nIn Example7's input, there are 1s in (0,0), (0,1), (2,0), (2,2). According to the hypothesis, the top row would be all 2s (from (0,0) and (0,1) covering columns0,1,2, and (2,0) and (2,2) covering columns0,2 and 2,0). So top row all 2s. The middle row's column1 has a 2. Maybe this comes from a 1 in row2, column1 (but there isn't any) or perhaps from the sum of certain movements.\n\nAlternatively, when a 1 is in row2, column j, it also affects the middle row. For example, moving up one row to row1, column j-1 mod3, then another step to row0. So for a 1 in row2, column1: moving up one to row1, column0 (j-1=0). Then moving up another step to row0, column2 (0-1= -1 mod3=2). So the middle row (row1) column0 would get a 2. But in Example7's input, there's a 1 at row2, column0: moving up to row1, column-1=2 mod3. So row1, column2. But Example7's output has row1, column1 as 2. Doesn't fit.\n\nThis is getting too complicated. Let's try to look for a different pattern.\n\nAnother observation: In all training examples, the output's 2s are only in the top row and sometimes the middle row. The bottom row is always all zeros. So perhaps the transformation is propagating 2s upwards, and maybe the middle row's 2s are from certain conditions.\n\nLooking at Example7's output:\n\n[2,2,2]\n\n[0,2,0]\n\n[0,0,0]\n\nThe middle row's 2 is in column1. The input has a 1 in row2, column2. So maybe when a 1 is in row2, column j, it affects the middle row's column j-1 mod3. For j=2: 2-1=1. So column1. That fits. Let's check other examples.\n\nExample8's input has a 1 in row2, column0. So j=0: j-1=2 mod3. Middle row column2. But the output's middle row is [0,2,0]. So no. Doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the middle row's 2s are from 1s in the same column but two rows below. Like, a 1 in row2, column1 affects middle row column1. But in Example7, there's a 1 in row2, column2, but middle row column1 has a 2. So not directly.\n\nLet's try to think of the output as follows:\n\n- For each 1 in the input, in row i, column j:\n\n   - If i is even (0 or 2), then add a 2 in the top row's column (j - i) mod3.\n\n   - If i is odd (1), add a 2 in the top row's column j.\n\nWait, but example0 has i=1, j=0. (j -i) mod3=2. Output is column0. Doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, for each 1 in row i, column j:\n\n- The number of 2s added to the top row is i+1, starting from column j and moving left.\n\nFor example:\n\ni=0: 1 cell \u2192 column j.\n\ni=1: 2 cells \u2192 columns j and j-1.\n\ni=2: 3 cells \u2192 columns j, j-1, j-2.\n\nBut wrapping around mod3.\n\nLet's test:\n\nExample0: i=1, j=0. So columns0 and2 (0-1=2). Output has columns0. Doesn't fit.\n\nExample1: i=0, j=1 \u2192 column1. i=1, j=0 \u2192 columns0 and2. So top row columns0,1,2. But output has columns0,1. So no.\n\nExample4: i=0, j=2 \u2192 column2. Output column0. Doesn't fit.\n\nNot working.\n\nAnother idea: The output is the bitwise OR of the input shifted upwards. For example, each row's 1s are shifted up to the row above, turning into 2s. But in Example0, the 1 is in row1, shifted to row0. So that fits. Example1 has 1s in row0 and row1. The row1's 1 shifts up to row0, but the row0's 1 stays. But the output has both row0 columns0 and1 as 2. So perhaps when shifting up, the 1s are moved to the row above and also to the left.\n\nAlternatively, when a 1 is shifted up, it moves to the left. So a 1 in rowi, columnj becomes a 2 in rowi-1, columnj-1 (mod3). If there's no row above (like row0), it wraps to the bottom row? But Example4's input is row0, column2. So shifting up would wrap to row2, column1. But output is row0, column0. Hmm, no.\n\nThis is really challenging. Let's try to summarize what we know:\n\n- The output's 2s are in the top row and sometimes the middle row.\n\n- 1s in lower rows (row1 and row2) contribute to 2s in higher rows.\n\n- The number of 2s in the top row seems to depend on the positions of the 1s.\n\n- In the test input, there are two 1s: (0,1) and (2,1). \n\nLooking at the training examples, when there are 1s in both the top and bottom rows of the same column, like Example5 has 1 in row0, column0 and row2, column0. The output's top row is all 2s. So perhaps the combination of 1s in different rows of the same column fills the top row.\n\nAlternatively, when there's a 1 in row0, columnj and a 1 in row2, columnj, it causes the entire top row to be filled with 2s.\n\nIn the test input, the two 1s are in column1 of row0 and row2. So this might cause the top row to be all 2s. \n\nLooking at Example5's input has 1s in row0, column0 and row2, column0. The output's top row is all 2s.\n\nSimilarly, Example6's input has 1s in row0, column1 and row1, columns0 and1. The output top row is all 2s. \n\nExample7's input has 1s in row0, columns0 and1, and row2, columns0 and2. Output top row all 2s.\n\nSo when there are 1s in both row0 and row2 of a column, the top row is filled. But in the test input, the 1s are in column1 of row0 and row2. So according to this pattern, the top row would be all 2s.\n\nAdditionally, sometimes the middle row gets a 2. For example, in Example7, the middle row has a 2 in column1. The input has a 1 in row2, column2. Maybe when a 1 is in row2, columnj, it also affects the middle row's column (j-1) mod3.\n\nFor the test input, the 1 in row2, column1 would affect the middle row's column0 (1-1=0). So the middle row would have a 2 in column0. But looking at similar examples, like Example7, that's not the case. \n\nAlternatively, the middle row's 2s are from 1s in row1, columnj. But in the test input, there are no 1s in row1.\n\nSo for the test input, the output might be:\n\n[2,2,2]\n\n[0,0,0]\n\n[0,0,0]\n\nBut let's look at Example4's input, which has a 1 in row0, column2. The output is [2,0,0]. So how does that happen? According to the previous assumption, a single 1 in row0, columnj would fill the top row. But Example4's output only fills column0. So there must be another rule.\n\nAlternatively, when there's a 1 in row0, columnj, it fills all columns from column0 to columnj. For example, j=2 would fill columns0-2. But Example4's output is only column0. Doesn't fit.\n\nThis suggests that my previous assumption is incorrect.\n\nAnother possible pattern: The 2s in the top row are determined by the positions of the 1s in the input, but with the following rule:\n\n- For each 1 in row i, column j, in the output's top row, the cell at column (j - i) mod3 is set to 2.\n\nLet's apply this to the test input:\n\nTest input has 1s at (0,1) and (2,1).\n\nFor (0,1):\n\ni=0, j=1 \u2192 (1 -0) mod3 =1 \u2192 column1.\n\nFor (2,1):\n\ni=2, j=1 \u2192 (1-2) =-1 mod3=2 \u2192 column2.\n\nSo the output's top row would have 2s in columns1 and2. But according to the training examples, when there are 1s in row0 and row2 of the same column (like Example5's input, which has 1s in column0 of rows0 and2), the top row is all 2s. But according to this rule, it would set columns (0-0)=0 and (0-2)=-2=1 mod3. Wait, no. Example5's input has 1s in row0, column0 (\u21920), row0, column1 (\u21921), and row2, column0 (\u21920-2=1 mod3=1). So columns0,1, and1. But the output is all 2s, which is columns0,1,2. So this doesn't fit.\n\nThus, this rule is incorrect.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and not finding a clear pattern, I'll need to make an educated guess based on the examples.\n\nThe test input has two 1s: (0,1) and (2,1).\n\nLooking at similar examples:\n\n- Example1 has 1s at (0,1) and (1,0). Output top row [2,2,0].\n\n- Example3 has 1s at (0,1) and (1,2). Output [2,2,0].\n\n- Example6 has 1s at (0,1), (1,0), (1,1). Output top row all 2s.\n\n- Example7 has 1s at (0,0), (0,1), (2,0), (2,2). Output top row all 2s.\n\nIn the test case, the two 1s are in column1 of rows0 and2. Looking at Example5, which has 1s in column0 of rows0 and2, the output is all 2s. So maybe when 1s are in the same column but in rows0 and2, the top row becomes all 2s. \n\nIn Example5, there's a third 1 in row2, column0. So perhaps even with two 1s in the same column across rows0 and2, the output's top row is all 2s. \n\nSo for the test input, the output's top row would be all 2s. \n\nAdditionally, looking at Example7 and others, when there are 1s in row2, there's a 2 in the middle row. But in the test input, there are no 1s in row2 besides the one in column1. So maybe the middle row's column0 gets a 2? Or not. \n\nBut in the test input, the output might be:\n\n[2,2,2]\n\n[0,0,0]\n\n[0,0,0]\n\nThis matches examples like Example5 and Example6 where multiple 1s lead to the top row being filled with 2s. However, in Example4, a single 1 in row0 leads to a single 2 in column0. So why the difference? \n\nPerhaps the rule is that when there are 1s in both row0 and row2 of the same column, the top row is completely filled. In the test input, the two 1s are in column1 of rows0 and2. So same column. Hence, the top row is all 2s. \n\nTherefore, the test output's top row is [2,2,2], and the middle and bottom rows are all zeros.\n\nSo the final answer would be:\n\n[2,2,2]\n\n[0,0,0]\n\n[0,0,0]"

        "cot_1": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. So, we have these 3x3 grids where the input is transformed into an output. The output seems to replace some 1s and 0s with 2s and 0s. Let's look at the training examples one by one to see if I can spot the rule.\n\nStarting with Example 0:\nInput is three rows: [0,0,0], [1,0,0], [0,0,0]. The output is [2,0,0] in the first row, others all zeros. So the 1 in the second row's first position turned into a 0, and the first row's first element became 2. Maybe the 2s are propagating upwards? But how?\n\nExample 1's input is [0,1,0], [1,0,0], [0,0,0]. Output is [2,2,0], rest zeros. The two 1s in the first and second rows (positions (0,1) and (1,0)) turned into 2s in the first row. Hmm, maybe the 2s are combining adjacent 1s?\n\nWait, in Example 0, there's a single 1. The output has a 2 in the position above it. So maybe each 1 in the grid causes the cell above it to become 2. But in Example 0, the 1 is in the second row, first column. The output has a 2 in the first row, same column. So that's directly above. Then, in Example 1, there's a 1 in (1,0) and (0,1). The output's first row has 2s in both columns 0 and 1. So each 1 in the input causes the cell above it to become 2. But if the 1 is in the top row, where does the 2 go? Maybe it stays there. Let's check Example 4: input is [0,0,1] in the first row, and the output is [2,0,0]. Wait, that's confusing. Wait, the input here is third example maybe? Wait, example 4's input is [0,0,1] in the first row, then two rows of zeros. The output is [2,0,0]. So the 1 is in the third column of the first row. The output has a 2 in the first column of the first row. That doesn't fit the \"above\" idea. Hmm, maybe there's a different direction.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are placed in positions that are adjacent to the 1s, but perhaps in a specific direction. Let's see another example. Example 2's input has 1s in (0,2) and (2,0). The output is [2,2,0] in the first row. So the 1 at (0,2) would have to affect the same row leftwards? Because the output's first row has 2s in columns 0 and 1. The 1 at (0,2) becomes a 2 in (0,0) and (0,1)? That doesn't make sense. Alternatively, maybe each 1 in the input contributes to 2s in certain directions. Maybe each 1 causes all cells to the left and above to become 2s. Let me test that.\n\nIn Example 0, the 1 is at (1,0). To the left, there's nothing. Above it is (0,0). So that becomes 2. Which matches the output. Example 1 has 1s at (0,1) and (1,0). The 1 at (0,1): above it would be out of bounds. To the left is (0,0). The 1 at (1,0) would affect above (0,0) and left (but left is nothing). So combining these, maybe the 1 at (0,1) causes (0,0) to become 2 (since left), and the 1 at (1,0) causes (0,0) to become 2. So output's first row is 2, 2, 0. That matches. Example 2's input has 1s at (0,2) and (2,0). The 1 at (0,2) would affect left cells: (0,1) and (0,0). The 1 at (2,0) would affect above (1,0) and (0,0). So combining, the first row would get 2s at 0,1, and 0. So output is [2,2,0], which matches. That seems plausible.\n\nSo the pattern could be: For every cell with a 1, all the cells to the left in the same row and all the cells above in the same column (up to the top) are set to 2. And then, after processing all 1s, the original 1s are set to 0. Also, if multiple 1s contribute to the same cell, it's still 2. Then, any cell that was a 1 in the input is set to 0 in the output.\n\nWait, but in Example 5, the input is [1,1,0], [0,0,0], [1,0,0]. Output is all 2s in the first row. Let's see. The first row has 1s at (0,0) and (0,1). The 1s in (0,0): left is none, above is none. So contributes nothing? Wait, but according to the previous idea, a 1 in (0,0) would affect cells left (none) and above (none). So no 2s from it. The 1 in (0,1) would affect left cells (0,0). So (0,0) becomes 2. Then the 1 in (2,0) would affect above cells (1,0) and (0,0). So (1,0) and (0,0) become 2. So combining all, (0,0) is 2, (0,1) would be 2 (from the first row 1's left?), but wait, maybe the direction is different. Maybe each 1 propagates 2s to the left in its row and upwards in its column. Let me recheck.\n\nIn Example 5's input, the first row has 1s at columns 0 and 1. For each of these 1s:\n\n- (0,0) (value 1): left is nothing, so left propagation does nothing. Up in column 0: row -1 (invalid). So maybe (0,0) doesn't contribute any 2s except perhaps itself? But in the output, the first row becomes [2,2,2]. Wait, that's conflicting. Let me think again. Maybe the rule is that for each 1, you set all cells to the left (same row, left columns) and all cells above (same column, higher rows) to 2, including the cell itself. Wait, maybe each 1 converts all cells to the left and above, including itself, into 2s. Then, after that, the original 1s are set to 0. But in that case, let's see.\n\nTake Example 0:\n\nInput has 1 at (1,0). For this 1, the cells to the left in its row (none) and the cells above (row 0, column 0). So the cell (0,0) becomes 2. The original 1 is turned into 0. So output is [2,0,0] in row 0, which matches.\n\nExample 1's input has 1s at (0,1) and (1,0).\n\nFor (0,1): cells to the left are (0,0) and (0,1) itself. So those become 2. For (1,0), cells to the left in row 1 (none), and cells above (row 0, column 0). So (0,0) becomes 2. So combining, first row would have (0,0) and (0,1) as 2, and (1,0) becomes 0. But the output's first row is [2,2,0]. Wait, but according to this, (0,1) would have itself as 2, and (0,0) from (1,0). So (0,0) and (0,1) are 2. But the output has [2,2,0]. So that's correct. But how does (0,1) contribute? Because the 1 at (0,1) would set all cells to its left (including itself) to 2. So (0,0) and (0,1) become 2. The 1 at (1,0) sets (0,0) to 2. So in the output, first row is [2,2,0], which matches.\n\nThen in Example 5's input, the 1s are at (0,0), (0,1), (2,0). Let's process each:\n\n- (0,0): left cells (none), but itself becomes 2. So (0,0) is 2. Also, cells above in column 0 (none). So only (0,0) becomes 2.\n\n- (0,1): left cells (0,0) and (0,1). So both become 2.\n\n- (2,0): left cells (none), and cells above in column 0: (1,0) and (0,0). So (1,0) becomes 2, (0,0) becomes 2.\n\nSo after processing all 1s:\n\n- Row 0, column 0: 2 (from (0,0) and (0,1) and (2,0))\n\n- Row 0, column 1: 2 (from (0,1))\n\n- Row 1, column 0: 2 (from (2,0))\n\nOriginal 1s are turned to 0. So output first row is [2,2,0], but according to the example's output, it's [2,2,2]. Hmm, that doesn't match. So this theory must be wrong.\n\nWait, the actual output for Example 5 is [2,2,2] in the first row. According to the previous logic, that third column (0,2) would not be affected. So maybe there's a different direction. Maybe the 1s affect cells to the right and down? Or maybe they affect all cells to the left and all cells in the same column above and below? Not sure. Let's look at Example 5's input again.\n\nInput for Example 5 is:\n\n[1,1,0]\n\n[0,0,0]\n\n[1,0,0]\n\nThe output is:\n\n[2,2,2]\n\n[0,0,0]\n\n[0,0,0]\n\nSo first row is all 2s. How does that happen?\n\nLet's see. The 1s are at (0,0), (0,1), and (2,0).\n\nIf each 1 affects all cells to the right (same row, right direction) and all cells below (same column, lower rows). Wait, but the output has the first row as 2s. If a 1 in (0,0) affects cells to the right (columns 0,1,2?), but that's not possible. Or maybe each 1 affects all cells to the left and right in their row, and all cells above and below in their column. But that seems complex.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are filling the entire row if there are 1s in that row. But in Example 0, the first row is all 0s except after processing. Hmm. Not sure.\n\nAlternative approach: Let's see what changes between input and output.\n\nLooking at Example 5:\n\nInput:\n\nRow 0: 1,1,0\n\nRow 1: 0,0,0\n\nRow 2: 1,0,0\n\nOutput:\n\nRow 0: 2,2,2\n\nRows 1 and 2: 0s.\n\nSo all three columns in row 0 become 2. How? Maybe each 1 in the input affects all cells in their row and column. For example, a 1 in (0,0) would mark all cells in row 0 and column 0 as 2. Similarly, 1 in (0,1) would mark row 0 and column 1. Then 1 in (2,0) marks row 2 and column 0.\n\nBut row 0 would have all columns 0,1 (from 1s in (0,0) and (0,1)), but the output has 2,2,2. So column 2 is also 2. That doesn't fit unless perhaps overlapping.\n\nWait, if each 1's row and column are filled with 2s. So for 1 at (0,0), row 0 becomes all 2s and column 0 becomes all 2s. Then 1 at (0,1) would also make row 0 all 2s (already done) and column 1 all 2s. The 1 at (2,0) would make row 2 all 2s and column 0 all 2s. So in the output, row 0 is all 2s (from the first two 1s), column 0 is all 2s (rows 0,1,2) but in the output, row 1 and 2's column 0 is 0. So this doesn't fit. So maybe not that.\n\nAlternative idea: the output is a count of how many 1s are in the same row or column. But in Example 0, there's one 1 in column 0 (second row), so the output's first row, column 0 is 2. Maybe 2 represents the presence of a 1 in that column. But why 2 instead of 1?\n\nWait, looking at Example 5's output, all columns in the first row are 2. The input has two 1s in row 0, and one in row 2, column 0. So perhaps if a column has at least one 1, the top cell of that column becomes 2. But in Example 5, column 0 has 1s in row 0 and 2. So the top cell (0,0) is 2. Column 1 has a 1 in row 0. So (0,1) becomes 2. Column 2 has no 1s. But in the output, column 2 in row 0 is 2. That doesn't fit. So this idea is wrong.\n\nHmm. Let's look at the outputs. In all examples, the output has 2s only in the first row, except for Example 7 and 8 where there's a 2 in the second row. Let's check Example 7's input:\n\nInput:\n\n[1,1,0]\n\n[0,0,0]\n\n[1,0,1]\n\nOutput:\n\n[2,2,2]\n\n[0,2,0]\n\n[0,0,0]\n\nSo in the output, the second row has a 2 in column 1. Hmm. How does that happen?\n\nAnother approach: perhaps the output is determined by the number of 1s in certain positions. For instance, each 1 in the input contributes to a 2 in a specific cell. Let's see.\n\nLooking for a pattern where 2s in the output are the sum of certain contributions from the 1s. Maybe each 1 adds to the cell above it. For example, a 1 in (row i, column j) contributes a 2 to (i-1, j). If multiple 1s contribute to the same cell, it's still 2. Then, in the output, all cells with at least one contribution become 2, others 0.\n\nLet's test this.\n\nExample 0: 1 is at (1,0). Contributes to (0,0). Output has 2 at (0,0). Correct.\n\nExample 1: 1s at (0,1) and (1,0). The 1 at (0,1) contributes to row -1, which is invalid. So only the 1 at (1,0) contributes to (0,0). But output is [2,2,0]. So this theory is wrong.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the direction is different. Maybe each 1 contributes to the cell to the left and above. Or to the cell diagonally. For example, if a 1 is in (i,j), then (i-1,j-1) becomes 2. But not sure.\n\nLooking at Example 2's input: [0,0,1], [0,0,0], [1,0,0]. Output: [2,2,0]. The 1s are at (0,2) and (2,0). If each contributes to (0-1, 2-1) = (-1,1) invalid. So no. Alternatively, each 1 contributes to the cell above it. The 1 at (0,2) can't go higher, but maybe the 1 at (2,0) contributes to (1,0), then (1,0) contributes to (0,0). But how? Maybe the 1s propagate upwards, each step moving the 2 up. But in the output of Example 2, the first row is [2,2,0]. So (0,0) and (0,1) are 2s. How do the 1s in (0,2) and (2,0) cause that? If the 1 at (0,2) can't go up, so maybe it propagates left? Then (0,2) would generate 2s to the left. So (0,1) and (0,0) become 2s. The 1 at (2,0) would propagate up to (1,0) and (0,0). So (0,0) becomes 2 from two sources, (0,1) from the left propagation of (0,2), and (1,0) from the up propagation of (2,0). But the output for Example 2 is [2,2,0], which matches this. Then, in the output, any cell that was a 1 in the input is turned into 0.\n\nSo the rule could be: For each 1 in the input grid, propagate a 2 to the left in its row (all cells to the left of the 1) and propagate a 2 upwards in its column (all cells above the 1, including the cell itself). Then, after processing all 1s, set all original 1s to 0.\n\nLet's test this with Example 5:\n\nInput:\n\nRow0:1,1,0\n\nRow1:0,0,0\n\nRow2:1,0,0\n\nProcessing each 1:\n\n1 at (0,0):\n\n- Left propagation in row0: cells (0,0) (itself), (0, -1) invalid. So only (0,0) becomes 2.\n\n- Up propagation in column0: cells (0,0) (itself), and nothing above. So (0,0) is 2.\n\nSo from this 1, (0,0) is 2.\n\n1 at (0,1):\n\n- Left propagation: cells (0,0) and (0,1). Both become 2.\n\n- Up propagation: column1, rows -1, so nothing. So (0,0) and (0,1) become 2.\n\n1 at (2,0):\n\n- Left propagation in row2: (2,0) and (2,-1). So only (2,0) becomes 2.\n\n- Up propagation in column0: cells (1,0) and (0,0). Both become 2.\n\nSo after processing all 1s:\n\nRow0:\n\n(0,0) gets 2 from (0,0) left, (0,0) up, (0,1) left, (2,0) up.\n\n(0,1) gets 2 from (0,1) left.\n\n(0,2) is not affected.\n\nBut according to the output, row0 is [2,2,2]. So (0,2) is also 2. Hmm, that doesn't fit. So this theory is missing something.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the left propagation includes the current cell and all to the left, and up propagation includes current cell and all above. But then, for (0,1):\n\nLeft propagation in row0 would be columns 0 and 1. So (0,0) and (0,1) become 2.\n\nUp propagation for (0,1) in column1 would be row0 (itself). So that's already covered.\n\nFor (2,0):\n\nLeft propagation in row2 is just (2,0).\n\nUp propagation in column0: rows 0,1,2. So (0,0), (1,0), (2,0) become 2.\n\nSo after processing all 1s:\n\nRow0: (0,0) (from all sources), (0,1) (from (0,1) left), (0,2) not affected.\n\nBut the output has (0,2) as 2. So how?\n\nWait, Example5's output is [2,2,2]. So there's a 2 in (0,2). Which isn't explained by the current theory. So maybe there's another direction. Maybe each 1 also propagates to the right and down? Or maybe it's a different direction.\n\nAlternative idea: Each 1 in the grid contributes to all cells in the rows above them. For example, a 1 in row i will set all cells in rows 0 to i-1 (same column) to 2. And also, in the same row, all cells to the left of the 1 (including itself) are set to 2.\n\nSo for Example5:\n\n1 at (0,0):\n\n- Same row, left: [0,0], which is column 0. So row0, column0 is 2.\n\n- Rows above (none, since row0 is the top). So no effect.\n\n1 at (0,1):\n\n- Same row, left: columns 0 and 1. So row0, columns0 and1 become 2.\n\n- Rows above: none.\n\n1 at (2,0):\n\n- Same row, left: column0 (since it's in row2, column0). So row2, column0 becomes 2.\n\n- Rows above (rows 0 and1), column0: set to 2.\n\nSo combining all:\n\nRow0, column0: set by (0,0), (0,1) left, and (2,0) column0.\n\nRow0, column1: set by (0,1) left.\n\nRow0, column2: no sources.\n\nRow1, column0: set by (2,0) column0.\n\nRow2, column0: set by (2,0) left.\n\nBut the output is:\n\nRow0: [2,2,2]\n\nRow1: [0,0,0]\n\nRow2: [0,0,0]\n\nSo this doesn't explain row0, column2. So this approach is missing something.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each 1 also affects cells to the right and below. But that's getting complicated.\n\nWait, let's look at the output of Example5. All three cells in the first row are 2. So perhaps the 1s in row0 are causing their entire row to become 2s, and the 1 in row2, column0 is causing the entire column0 to become 2s. So:\n\nAny row that has at least one 1 will have all its cells in the output row set to 2. Any column that has at least one 1 will have the entire column in the output set to 2. Then, the output cell is 2 if either its row or column has any 1. But in Example5's output, the entire first row is 2, which would mean that row0 has 1s (which it does), so all of row0 is 2. Column0 has 1s in row0 and row2, so all of column0 in output would be 2. But in the output, row0's column0 and column1 and column2 are 2. But column2 in the input has no 1s. So how does row0's column2 become 2?\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's a combination of row and column. For example, a cell in (i,j) becomes 2 if there is a 1 in row i or column j. But in Example5, row0 has 1s, so all cells in row0 become 2. Column0 has 1s in row0 and 2, so column0 cells are 2. But column1 has a 1 in row0, so column1 cells are 2. Column2 has no 1s, but in row0, column2 would be 2 because row0 has 1s. So that explains why row0's column2 is 2. But in Example0's input, row1 has a 1. So row1 would be all 2s, but in the output, row1 is all 0s. So this theory is incorrect.\n\nHmm. This is challenging. Let's think differently. Looking at the outputs, in all examples, the output is built such that the first row has 2s that seem to aggregate the positions of the 1s in the input. For example, in Example1, where there are 1s in (0,1) and (1,0), the output's first row has 2s in columns 0 and 1. Example2 has 1s in (0,2) and (2,0), and the output's first row has 2s in 0 and 1. Example3's input has 1s in (0,1) and (1,2), output's first row has 2s in 0 and 1. Example4's input has a 1 in (0,2), output's first row has 2 in 0. So there's a pattern where the 2s in the first row seem to be covering columns to the left of where the 1s are in their rows. For example, in Example4, input's 1 is in column2 of row0. The output's first row has a 2 in column0. That's confusing. Or perhaps it's the maximum column index of a 1 in each row, but that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, in Example4, the input has a single 1 in row0, column2. The output's first row is [2,0,0]. So it's as if the 2 is in the leftmost position. So perhaps for each row in the input that has a 1, the leftmost occurrence in that row determines the position in the first row. But how?\n\nAlternatively, for each 1 in the input, its column is marked in the first row, but the 2s accumulate from left to right. For example, the leftmost column with any 1 in any row becomes 2 in the first row, and any column to the right of that also becomes 2 up to the rightmost column with a 1. But looking at Example5's input, columns 0 and 1 have 1s (in rows 0 and 0), and column0 in row2. The output's first row is all 2s. So columns 0,1,2 all are 2. But the rightmost column with a 1 is 1 (from row0). So this doesn't explain why column2 is 2 in the output.\n\nAlternatively, the first row in the output is a cumulative OR of all the rows below. For example, any column that has a 1 in any row below is marked as 2 in the first row, and all columns to the left of it are also marked. Let's see:\n\nExample0's input has a 1 in row1, column0. So in the first row, columns up to 0 are marked. So column0 becomes 2. Output matches.\n\nExample1's input has 1 in row0 column1 and row1 column0. The maximum column in row0 is 1, and row1's column0. So in the first row, columns up to max column (1) would be 2. So output [2,2,0], which matches.\n\nExample2's input has 1 in row0 column2 and row2 column0. The max column in row0 is 2, so columns 0-2 are marked. But output's first row is [2,2,0]. Hmm, that doesn't fit. Alternatively, it's the maximum column across all rows. Row0 has 2, row2 has 0. So max column is 2. So first row's columns 0-2 are 2. But output is [2,2,0]. So that's inconsistent.\n\nWait, but in Example2's output, first row is [2,2,0]. So columns 0 and 1 are 2, column2 is 0. So how does that fit with the input's max column being 2? Maybe it's not based on max column. \n\nAnother idea: For each 1 in the input, all cells in the first row from column 0 up to the column of the 1 are set to 2. Then, the first row's cells are 2 if any 1 in the input's columns up to that cell's column exists.\n\nSo for Example0: 1 in column0. So first row's columns 0-0 are set to 2. Output is [2,0,0].\n\nExample1: 1s in column0 (row1) and column1 (row0). So columns0 and 1 are set. So first row becomes [2,2,0].\n\nExample2: 1s in column2 (row0) and column0 (row2). The 1 in column2 would set first row's columns0-2 to 2. The 1 in column0 would set columns0-0. So combined, first row is [2,2,2]. But the output is [2,2,0]. So this doesn't fit. So this idea is wrong.\n\nAlternative approach: Let's list for each example the input and output first row, and see if there's a pattern.\n\nExample0:\n\nInput: 1 at (1,0)\n\nOutput first row: [2,0,0]\n\nExample1:\n\nInput: 1s at (0,1) and (1,0)\n\nOutput first row: [2,2,0]\n\nExample2:\n\nInput: 1s at (0,2) and (2,0)\n\nOutput first row: [2,2,0]\n\nExample3:\n\nInput: 1s at (0,1) and (1,2)\n\nOutput first row: [2,2,0]\n\nExample4:\n\nInput: 1 at (0,2)\n\nOutput first row: [2,0,0]\n\nExample5:\n\nInput: 1s at (0,0), (0,1), (2,0)\n\nOutput first row: [2,2,2]\n\nExample6:\n\nInput: 1s at (0,1), (1,0), (1,1)\n\nOutput first row: [2,2,2]\n\nExample7:\n\nInput: 1s at (0,0), (0,1), (2,0), (2,2)\n\nOutput first row: [2,2,2], second row has [0,2,0]\n\nExample8:\n\nInput: 1s at (0,1), (1,0), (1,1), (2,0)\n\nOutput first row: [2,2,2], second row [0,2,0]\n\nExample9:\n\nInput: 1s at (0,0), (1,2), (2,1), (2,2)\n\nOutput first row: [2,2,2], second row [0,2,0]\n\nLooking at these, the first row's 2s seem to cover all columns up to the maximum column of any 1 in the input. For example:\n\nExample0: max column is 0. First row has 2 in 0.\n\nExample1: max column is 1. First row has 2s in 0 and 1.\n\nExample2: max column is 2, but first row has 2s up to 1. So this doesn't fit. So maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, the first row's 2s are in the same positions as the columns that have at least one 1 in the input, plus all columns to the left.\n\nFor example, if any column j has a 1, then all columns from 0 to j in the first row are 2.\n\nExample0: column0 has a 1. So first row 0-0: 2.\n\nExample1: column0 and 1 have 1s. So first row 0-1: 2s.\n\nExample2: columns0 and 2 have 1s. So first row 0-2 should be 2s, but output is [2,2,0]. So this doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. So maybe the first row's 2s are in columns that are the union of all columns with 1s in any row, but only up to the leftmost column with a 1 in some row. Wait, not sure.\n\nWait, let's think about Example2's input. It has a 1 in column2 (row0) and column0 (row2). The output first row is [2,2,0]. So columns0 and 1 are 2. But the input has 1s in columns0 and 2. How does that lead to columns0 and1 being 2?\n\nPerhaps the first row's 2s are in columns where there's a 1 in that column or any column to the right. For example, if there's a 1 in column j, then all columns from 0 to j-1 become 2. No, that doesn't make sense. Or maybe it's the opposite: for each 1 in column j, all columns from j to 0 become 2. So for Example2's column2 1, columns0,1,2 become 2. For column0 1, columns0 become 2. Combined, columns0,1,2. But the output is [2,2,0], so column2 is 0. So that's not matching.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for each 1 in column j, the first row's column j becomes 2, and all columns to the left of j are also 2. For example, if there's a 1 in column2, the first row's columns0,1,2 become 2. But Example2's output for first row is [2,2,0], which doesn't match. So that's not correct.\n\nLet's look at Example4. Input has a 1 in column2 (row0). The output first row is [2,0,0]. So how does that fit? If the 1 is in column2, why is only column0 set to 2?\n\nThis suggests that the column in the first row that gets a 2 is the column of the leftmost 1 in the entire grid.\n\nExample0: leftmost 1 is in column0. So first row's column0 is 2.\n\nExample1: leftmost 1 is in column0 (row1, column0) and column0 in row1. So first row's columns0 and1 are 2. But why column1? There's a 1 in row0, column1. So perhaps the leftmost 1 in each row contributes to the first row.\n\nAlternatively, for each row, if there's a 1, the leftmost 1's column in that row is marked in the first row, and all columns to the left of it in the first row are also marked as 2. Then, the union of all such columns across all rows determines the first row's 2s.\n\nLet's test this with Example0:\n\nRow1 has a 1 in column0. Leftmost (and only) 1 is in column0. So in the first row, column0 is marked, and columns left of it (none) are also marked. So first row column0 is 2. Output matches.\n\nExample1:\n\nRow0 has a 1 in column1 (leftmost). So first row's columns0 and1 are marked. Row1 has a 1 in column0 (leftmost). So columns0 is marked. The union of columns0 and1. So first row is [2,2,0]. Correct.\n\nExample2:\n\nRow0 has a 1 in column2 (leftmost). So first row's columns0,1,2 are marked. Row2 has a 1 in column0 (leftmost). So columns0 is marked. Union is columns0,1,2. But output is [2,2,0]. So this doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. So this theory also fails.\n\nThis is getting quite challenging. Let's try to think of another angle. Perhaps the output's first row is the sum of the input's columns, but each column's sum is capped at 1 and then multiplied by 2. For example, if a column has any 1, it becomes 2 in the first row.\n\nExample0: column0 has a 1. So first row column0 is 2. Others 0. Correct.\n\nExample1: columns0 and1 have 1s. So first row columns0 and1 are 2. Correct.\n\nExample2: columns0 and2 have 1s. So first row columns0 and2 are 2. But output is [2,2,0]. So this doesn't fit. So this theory is wrong.\n\nAlternatively, the output's first row is 2 in all columns where there is a 1 in any row to the left in the same column. For example, if there's a 1 in column j, row i, then in the first row, all columns to the left of j (including j) become 2. But this doesn't make sense.\n\nLooking at Example7's output, the second row has a 2 in column1. The input has 1s in (2,2). How does that contribute to the second row's column1?\n\nExample7's input:\n\n[1,1,0]\n\n[0,0,0]\n\n[1,0,1]\n\nOutput:\n\n[2,2,2]\n\n[0,2,0]\n\n[0,0,0]\n\nSo second row has a 2 in column1. Perhaps the 2s are propagating diagonally? The 1 in (2,2) could affect the cell diagonally above and to the left. For example, from (2,2), moving up-left one step would be (1,1). So that cell becomes 2. But how?\n\nAlternatively, in Example7, the 1 at (2,2) (row2, column2) would propagate up the column to row1 and row0. But output's column2 in row0 is 2. But the output's row1, column1 is 2. Not sure.\n\nAnother observation: In the output, all the 2s are in positions that are to the left or above of the original 1s. For example, in Example2, the 1s are in (0,2) and (2,0). The output's first row has 2s in columns0 and1. The 1 at (0,2) would have 2s to the left in the first row. The 1 at (2,0) would have 2s above (row1 and row0, column0).\n\nWait, perhaps each 1 in the input converts all cells to the left (in their row) and all cells above (in their column) into 2s. So for each 1 at (i,j), all cells (i, k) where k <= j (left) and all cells (k, j) where k <= i (above). So combining all these cells, the output is the union of these cells.\n\nLet's test this with Example0:\n\n1 at (1,0):\n\n- Left: row1, columns0.\n\n- Above: column0, rows1 and 0.\n\nSo the cells affected are (1,0), (0,0). But the output is [2,0,0], [0,0,0], ... So only (0,0) is 2. But according to this, (1,0) should also be 2. But the output has it as 0. So perhaps the original 1s are set to 0, and the affected cells (excluding the original) are set to 2.\n\nSo for each 1 at (i,j), set all cells to the left (same row, columns < j) to 2, and all cells above (same column, rows < i) to 2. The original 1s become 0.\n\nLet's test this.\n\nExample0:\n\n1 at (1,0). Columns <0: none. So left cells: none. Rows <1 (row0) in column0: (0,0). So (0,0) becomes 2. Original 1 becomes 0. Output matches.\n\nExample1:\n\n1s at (0,1) and (1,0).\n\nFor (0,1):\n\n- Left: columns0 and 1. But j=1, so columns <1 are 0. So cells (0,0).\n\n- Above: row0's column1 has no rows above, so no effect.\n\nFor (1,0):\n\n- Left: no columns <0.\n\n- Above: row0, column0.\n\nSo combined, (0,0) from both 1s. But the output is [2,2,0]. So this theory is missing something. Why is (0,1) 2?\n\nWait, perhaps the cell itself (i,j) is also included in the left propagation. For example, for j=1, columns <=1. So for (0,1), left includes columns0 and1. So (0,0) and (0,1). The above would be rows <0, which is none. So (0,0) and (0,1) become 2. For (1,0), left is columns <=0 (only 0), so (1,0). But above is rows <1 (row0), so (0,0). So combining:\n\nFrom (0,1): (0,0), (0,1) \u2192 2.\n\nFrom (1,0): (1,0), (0,0) \u2192 2.\n\nBut original 1s are set to 0. So in the output, (0,0) and (0,1) are 2. (1,0) is 0. Output is [2,2,0] in first row, which matches.\n\nThis seems to fit. Let's check Example2:\n\nInput 1s at (0,2) and (2,0).\n\nProcessing (0,2):\n\n- Left: columns0,1,2 (since j=2, columns <=2, but maybe columns < j? If j=2, columns <2 are 0 and1. Or left includes the current column?\n\nWait, the rule needs to be clarified. If for a 1 at (i,j), the left propagation includes all columns to the left of and including j, or just left?\n\nAssuming that left propagation includes the cell itself and all to the left. So for j=2, columns 0,1,2.\n\nBut then, in Example2's input, the 1 at (0,2) would set columns0,1,2 in row0 to 2. But the output's first row is [2,2,0]. So this doesn't fit. So perhaps the left propagation is to the left of j (excluding j), and the current cell is handled by another rule.\n\nAlternatively, the left propagation is all cells to the left of j (exclusive), and the above propagation is all cells above i (exclusive). Then, the cell (i,j) is set to 0.\n\nLet's re-express the rule:\n\nFor each 1 at (i,j):\n\n- All cells in the same row i, columns 0 to j-1 (left of j) are set to 2.\n\n- All cells in the same column j, rows 0 to i-1 (above i) are set to 2.\n\nOriginal 1s are set to 0.\n\nLet's test this with Example0:\n\n1 at (1,0):\n\n- Left of 0: none.\n\n- Above 1: rows 0. So column0, row0 becomes 2.\n\nOutput: [2,0,0], which matches.\n\nExample1:\n\n1s at (0,1) and (1,0).\n\nFor (0,1):\n\n- Left of j=1: columns0.\n\n- Above i=0: none.\n\nSo sets (0,0) to 2.\n\nFor (1,0):\n\n- Left of j=0: none.\n\n- Above i=1: row0, column0.\n\nSo sets (0,0) to 2.\n\nOriginal 1s become 0.\n\nOutput first row: [2,0,0]. But according to the example, it's [2,2,0]. So this theory is incorrect.\n\nHmm. This is really tricky. Let me think of another way. Looking at Example2's output: [2,2,0]. The input has a 1 at (0,2). So perhaps for that 1, the left propagation includes columns0 and1. And for the 1 at (2,0), the above propagation includes row0 and1. So:\n\nFor (0,2) (row0, column2):\n\n- Left propagation: columns0 and1 (since j=2, columns0 and1 are to the left).\n\n- Above propagation: none (row0 is top).\n\nSo row0, columns0 and1 become 2.\n\nFor (2,0) (row2, column0):\n\n- Left propagation: none (j=0, no columns to the left).\n\n- Above propagation: rows0 and1, column0.\n\nSo row0 and1, column0 become 2.\n\nCombining these:\n\nRow0, column0: 2 (from both 1s).\n\nRow0, column1: 2 (from (0,2)).\n\nRow1, column0: 2 (from (2,0)).\n\nOriginal 1s are set to 0.\n\nSo output row0: [2,2,0], row1: [0,0,0], which matches Example2's output.\n\nYes! This seems to work. So the rule is:\n\nFor each 1 at position (i,j):\n\n- For the same row i, set all cells to the left (columns 0 to j-1) to 2.\n\n- For the same column j, set all cells above (rows 0 to i-1) to 2.\n\nThen, all original 1s are set to 0.\n\nLet's test this with Example1:\n\n1s at (0,1) and (1,0).\n\nFor (0,1):\n\n- Left columns 0.\n\n- Above: no rows.\n\nSo sets (0,0) to 2.\n\nFor (1,0):\n\n- Left: no columns.\n\n- Above rows0, column0.\n\nSo sets (0,0) to 2.\n\nCombined, row0: [2,0,0] but the output is [2,2,0]. So this doesn't fit. Wait, why?\n\nWait, in Example1, the input is:\n\nRow0: [0,1,0]\n\nRow1: [1,0,0]\n\nRow2: [0,0,0]\n\nProcessing the 1 at (0,1):\n\n- Left columns0, j=1 \u2192 columns0.\n\nSo row0, column0 becomes 2.\n\nProcessing the 1 at (1,0):\n\n- Left: j=0 \u2192 columns left of 0 (none).\n\n- Above rows0, column0.\n\nSo row0, column0 becomes 2.\n\nSo row0, column0 is 2 (from both), column1 is still 0. But the output's row0 is [2,2,0]. So this doesn't match. What's wrong here?\n\nAh! I think I made a mistake in the rule. Maybe when j=1 in row0, the left columns are 0 and 1 (including current column?), but the rule said left of j, i.e., columns 0 to j-1. So for j=1, columns 0. So row0, column0 becomes 2.\n\nBut in Example1's output, row0's column1 is 2. So this theory doesn't explain that. So maybe the rule is that for each 1 at (i,j), set all cells to the left (columns 0 to j) and all cells above (rows 0 to i).\n\nWait, but including the current cell. But original 1s are set to 0.\n\nWait, let's adjust the rule:\n\nFor each 1 at (i,j):\n\n- Set all cells in row i, columns 0 to j (inclusive) to 2.\n\n- Set all cells in column j, rows 0 to i (inclusive) to 2.\n\nThen, set all original 1s to 0.\n\nLet's test this.\n\nExample0: 1 at (1,0).\n\n- Row1, columns0-0 \u2192 set to 2.\n\n- Column0, rows0-1 \u2192 set to 2.\n\nAfter setting, then set original 1 to 0.\n\nSo row0, column0: 2.\n\nRow1, column0: 2 (from column0 processing), but original 1 becomes 0.\n\nSo output row0: [2,0,0], row1: [0,0,0], which matches.\n\nExample1:\n\n1s at (0,1) and (1,0).\n\nProcessing (0,1):\n\n- Row0, columns0-1 \u2192 set to 2.\n\n- Column1, rows0-0 \u2192 set to 2.\n\nSo row0, columns0 and1 are 2.\n\nProcessing (1,0):\n\n- Row1, columns0-0 \u2192 set to 2.\n\n- Column0, rows0-1 \u2192 set to 2.\n\nSo row0, column0 becomes 2 (again), row1, column0 becomes 2.\n\nOriginal 1s set to 0.\n\nSo output row0: [2,2,0], row1: [0,0,0]. Which matches Example1's output.\n\nNow let's test Example2:\n\nInput 1s at (0,2) and (2,0).\n\nProcessing (0,2):\n\n- Row0, columns0-2 \u2192 set to 2.\n\n- Column2, rows0-0 \u2192 set to 2.\n\nSo row0, columns0-2 are 2.\n\nProcessing (2,0):\n\n- Row2, columns0-0 \u2192 set to 2.\n\n- Column0, rows0-2 \u2192 set to 2.\n\nSo row0, column0 \u2192 2.\n\n row1, column0 \u2192 2.\n\n row2, column0 \u2192 2.\n\nOriginal 1s set to 0.\n\nSo output row0: [2,2,2], but according to the example, row0 is [2,2,0]. So this contradicts.\n\nHmm. So this theory is not correct. But according to this theory, the output for Example2 should have row0, column2 as 2. But the example's output has it as 0. So this theory is incorrect.\n\nBut according to Example2's output, the first row has 2s only up to column1. How does that happen?\n\nWait, let me check Example2's input and output again.\n\nInput for Example2:\n\n[0,0,1]\n\n[0,0,0]\n\n[1,0,0]\n\nOutput:\n\n[2,2,0]\n\n[0,0,0]\n\n[0,0,0]\n\nAccording to this, the first row's columns0 and1 are 2, column2 is 0. So how?\n\nAccording to the previous theory, processing the 1 at (0,2) would set row0, columns0-2 to 2. So why is column2 0?\n\nAh! Because after setting all those to 2, the original 1 is at (0,2), which is then set to 0. So perhaps the steps are:\n\n1. For each 1 in the input, mark the required cells (row and column) as 2.\n\n2. Then, set all original 1s to 0.\n\nSo even if a cell was set to 2 by another 1, if it was originally a 1, it becomes 0.\n\nBut in Example2's input, the 1 at (0,2) is processed first: sets row0 columns0-2 and column2 rows0-0 to 2. So after this step, cell (0,2) is 2. Then, when setting all original 1s to 0, it becomes 0. So the final result would have (0,2) as 0. So the first row becomes [2,2,0], which matches the example.\n\nYes! So the corrected steps are:\n\n- For each 1 in the input, set all cells in the same row (columns 0 to j) and same column (rows 0 to i) to 2.\n\n- After processing all 1s, set any cell that was originally a 1 to 0.\n\nThis way, even if a cell was set to 2 by another 1, if it was originally a 1, it becomes 0.\n\nLet's test this with Example2:\n\n1 at (0,2):\n\n- Row0, columns0-2 \u2192 all set to 2.\n\n- Column2, rows0-0 \u2192 cell (0,2) set to 2.\n\nAfter this, the cell (0,2) is 2.\n\n1 at (2,0):\n\n- Row2, columns0-0 \u2192 set to 2.\n\n- Column0, rows0-2 \u2192 rows0,1,2, column0 \u2192 set to 2.\n\nAfter processing both 1s:\n\nRow0: all columns are 2 (from first 1) and column0 is 2 (from second 1).\n\nBut the original 1 at (0,2) is set to 0. So cell (0,2) becomes 0.\n\nSo row0 becomes [2,2,0], which matches.\n\nYes! This seems to work.\n\nLet's check Example5:\n\nInput:\n\n[1,1,0]\n\n[0,0,0]\n\n[1,0,0]\n\nProcessing each 1:\n\n1 at (0,0):\n\n- Row0 columns0-0 \u2192 set to 2.\n\n- Column0 rows0-0 \u2192 set to 2.\n\nCell (0,0) is 2.\n\n1 at (0,1):\n\n- Row0 columns0-1 \u2192 set to 2.\n\n- Column1 rows0-0 \u2192 set to 2.\n\nCell (0,1) is 2.\n\n1 at (2,0):\n\n- Row2 columns0-0 \u2192 set to 2.\n\n- Column0 rows0-2 \u2192 set to 2 for rows0,1,2.\n\nAfter processing all:\n\nRow0 columns0-1 are 2 (from (0,0) and (0,1)), and row0 column0 is also set by (2,0). Column0, rows0-2 are 2.\n\nThen, set all original 1s to 0:\n\nOriginal 1s are (0,0), (0,1), (2,0).\n\nSo after setting to 0:\n\nRow0, columns0 and1 become 0. But wait, no. Because during processing, they were set to 2 by other 1s. Wait, the original 1s are those positions in the input. So after processing, those cells are set to 0. Let's track:\n\nAfter processing:\n\nRow0:\n\ncolumns0: set to 2 by (0,0), (0,1), (2,0).\n\ncolumns1: set to 2 by (0,1).\n\ncolumns2: set to 0 (originally 0).\n\nThen, original 1s are (0,0), (0,1), (2,0). These are set to 0.\n\nSo after setting to 0:\n\nRow0:\n\ncolumns0: was 2, but (0,0) is set to 0.\n\ncolumns1: was 2, but (0,1) is set to 0.\n\ncolumns2: 0.\n\nBut wait, this would make row0 [0,0,0], which contradicts the example output.\n\nHmm, this is a problem. So according to this theory, the output would have row0 as [0,0,0], but the actual output is [2,2,2]. So this theory is incorrect.\n\nBut how can this be?\n\nAh! Wait, because during processing, even though the original 1s are set to 0 at the end, other 1s may have set the same cells to 2. For example, in Example5:\n\nThe 1 at (0,0) sets row0 columns0-0 and column0 rows0-0 to 2. But then the 1 at (0,1) sets row0 columns0-1 and column1 rows0-0 to 2. The 1 at (2,0) sets row2 columns0-0 and column0 rows0-2 to 2.\n\nSo after processing all 1s:\n\nRow0:\n\ncolumns0: 2 (from (0,0), (0,1), (2,0))\n\ncolumns1: 2 (from (0,1))\n\ncolumns2: 0.\n\nColumns0 is set by multiple sources. Then, the original 1s at (0,0) and (0,1) are set to 0. So after this step, row0 columns0 and1 would become 0?\n\nNo. Because during processing, other 1s set those cells to 2. Only the original 1's position is set to 0. So the cells (0,0) and (0,1) are set to 0, but the other cells in row0 that were set to 2 by other 1s remain 2. Wait, no. Because the processing step first marks all the required cells to 2, then sets the original 1s to 0. So even if a cell was set to 2 by another 1, if it was an original 1, it becomes 0.\n\nSo in Example5:\n\nRow0, column0 is set to 2 by (0,0), (0,1), and (2,0). But since (0,0) is an original 1, it is set to 0. The other cells in row0, columns0 (like from (2,0) processing) are in row0, column0. But no, the processing for (2,0) sets column0 in rows0-2. So row0, column0 is set to 2 by (2,0). Then, after processing all 1s, the original 1s (0,0), (0,1), (2,0) are set to 0.\n\nSo row0, column0 is set to 2 by (2,0), but the original 1 is (0,0), which is set to 0. So row0, column0 is 2 (from (2,0) processing), but after setting original 1s to 0, does (0,0) become 0? Yes. Because (0,0) was a 1 in the input, regardless of any processing, it is set to 0.\n\nWait, this is confusing. Let's clarify:\n\nThe process is:\n\n1. For each 1 in the input grid, mark the required cells (row and column) as 2. This is done for all 1s, so multiple 1s can overwrite each other's effects.\n\n2. After all 1s have been processed, set any cell that was originally a 1 (in the input) to 0.\n\nSo even if a cell was set to 2 during processing, if it was originally a 1, it is now 0.\n\nSo in Example5:\n\nOriginal 1s are (0,0), (0,1), (2,0).\n\nDuring processing:\n\n- (0,0) sets row0 columns0-0 to 2, and column0 rows0-0 to 2.\n\n- (0,1) sets row0 columns0-1 to 2, and column1 rows0-0 to 2.\n\n- (2,0) sets row2 columns0-0 to 2, and column0 rows0-2 to 2.\n\nSo after processing:\n\nRow0:\n\ncolumn0: 2 (from (0,0), (0,1), (2,0))\n\ncolumn1: 2 (from (0,1))\n\ncolumn2: 0.\n\nRow1:\n\ncolumn0: 2 (from (2,0))\n\nRow2:\n\ncolumn0: 2 (from (2,0))\n\nNow, set original 1s to 0:\n\n- (0,0) becomes 0.\n\n- (0,1) becomes 0.\n\n- (2,0) becomes 0.\n\nSo the final output:\n\nRow0: [0,0,0] \u2192 but the example's output is [2,2,2]. So this doesn't match. Thus, this theory is incorrect.\n\nThis suggests that the original 1s are set to 0, but their effects during processing are still present in other cells. However, in Example5, the output's first row is [2,2,2], which implies that even after setting the original 1s to 0, the other cells in the row are 2. But according to the theory, the row0 columns0 and1 would have been set to 2 by other 1s, but the processing would have already set them to 2.\n\nWait, no. Let's think again. For Example5:\n\nProcessing the 1 at (0,0):\n\n- Row0 columns0-0 (only column0) become 2.\n\n- Column0 rows0-0 (row0, column0) becomes 2.\n\nSo after this, row0 is [2,1,0].\n\nThen, processing the 1 at (0,1):\n\n- Row0 columns0-1 (columns0 and1) become 2.\n\n- Column1 rows0-0 becomes 2.\n\nSo row0 becomes [2,2,0].\n\nThen, processing the 1 at (2,0):\n\n- Row2 columns0-0 becomes 2.\n\n- Column0 rows0-2 becomes 2.\n\nSo row0, column0 is already 2, row1, column0 becomes 2, row2, column0 becomes 2.\n\nNow, after all processing, the grid is:\n\nRow0: [2,2,0]\n\nRow1: [2,0,0]\n\nRow2: [2,0,0]\n\nThen, set original 1s to 0:\n\nOriginal 1s are (0,0), (0,1), (2,0). So after setting:\n\nRow0: [0,0,0]\n\nRow2: [0,0,0]\n\nBut the example's output is [2,2,2], [0,0,0], [0,0,0]. So this doesn't match. So this theory is wrong.\n\nI'm really stuck here. Let's look at Example7's output to see if there's a clue.\n\nExample7's input:\n\n[1,1,0]\n\n[0,0,0]\n\n[1,0,1]\n\nOutput:\n\n[2,2,2]\n\n[0,2,0]\n\n[0,0,0]\n\nProcessing according to the previous theory:\n\nOriginal 1s are (0,0), (0,1), (2,0), (2,2).\n\nProcessing each:\n\n(0,0):\n\n- row0 columns0-0 \u2192 [2,1,0].\n\n- column0 rows0-0 \u2192 [2,0,0].\n\n(0,1):\n\n- row0 columns0-1 \u2192 [2,2,0].\n\n- column1 rows0-0 \u2192 [2,2,0].\n\n(2,0):\n\n- row2 columns0-0 \u2192 [2,0,0].\n\n- column0 rows0-2 \u2192 [2,0,0], [2,0,0], [2,0,0].\n\n(2,2):\n\n- row2 columns0-2 \u2192 [2,0,2].\n\n- column2 rows0-2 \u2192 [0,0,2], [0,0,2], [2,0,2].\n\nAfter processing all 1s, the grid would be:\n\nRow0: [2,2,2] (from (0,1) row processing and (2,2) column processing for column2).\n\nRow1: [2,2,2] (from column0 and column2 processing? No, maybe not. Let me step through each 1's effect.\n\nWait, this is getting too complicated. Perhaps there's a different approach.\n\nLooking at all the examples, the output seems to accumulate 2s in the first row based on the positions of the 1s in the input. For example, each 1 adds a 2 in the first row's leftmost position. But this doesn't hold for all cases.\n\nAlternatively, the output's first row is the bitwise OR of all rows in the input, but with a left shift. For example, each 1 in a row contributes to a 2 in the first row's columns to the left of its position.\n\nExample0: 1 in row1, column0 \u2192 first row column0 is 2.\n\nExample1: 1 in row0, column1 \u2192 first row columns0 and1 are 2.\n\nExample2: 1 in row0, column2 \u2192 first row columns0,1,2 are 2. But output is [2,2,0], so this doesn't fit.\n\nThis is really challenging. Let's try to see if there's a pattern in the first row's 2s and the positions of the 1s.\n\nFor each example:\n\n- The number of 2s in the first row seems to be the number of 1s in the input, but not exactly.\n\nExample0: 1 1 \u2192 1 2.\n\nExample1: 2 1s \u2192 2 2s.\n\nExample2: 2 1s \u2192 2 2s.\n\nExample5:3 1s \u21923 2s in first row.\n\nExample7:4 1s \u21923 2s in first row and 1 in second row.\n\nHmm. Not sure.\n\nAlternative idea: The output is generated by a cellular automaton-like rule, where each 1 in the input generates a 2 in the cell above it and to the left. Then, these 2s propagate upwards and to the left as well. But this is vague.\n\nAlternatively, the output is the result of a BFS starting from each 1, moving left and up, and marking cells as 2.\n\nExample0's 1 at (1,0) would BFS left (none) and up (row0, column0), which becomes 2.\n\nExample1's 1 at (0,1) would BFS left to (0,0) and up to nowhere. 1 at (1,0) would BFS up to (0,0). So (0,0) and (0,1) become 2.\n\nExample2's 1 at (0,2) would BFS left to (0,0), (0,1), and up to nowhere. 1 at (2,0) would BFS up to (1,0) and (0,0). So (0,0) and (0,1) become 2 from (0,2)'s left BFS, and (0,0) from (2,0)'s up BFS. So first row is [2,2,0], which matches.\n\nExample5's input:\n\n1s at (0,0), (0,1), (2,0).\n\nBFS for (0,0): left is none, up none. So only (0,0).\n\nBFS for (0,1): left to (0,0), up none.\n\nBFS for (2,0): up to (1,0) and (0,0).\n\nSo all BFS would contribute to (0,0), (0,1), (1,0). But the output's first row is [2,2,2]. So this doesn't fit.\n\nThis is very confusing. Given the time I've spent and the complexity of the examples, I think the correct pattern is that for each 1 at (i,j), all cells to the left in its row (columns 0 to j) and all cells above in its column (rows 0 to i) are set to 2. Then, all original 1s are set to 0. \n\nApplying this to the test input:\n\nTest Input:\n\n[0,1,0]\n\n[0,1,1]\n\n[1,0,0]\n\nProcessing each 1:\n\n1 at (0,1):\n\n- Row0, columns0-1 \u2192 set to 2.\n\n- Column1, rows0-0 \u2192 set to 2.\n\nResulting in row0: [2,2,0].\n\n1 at (1,1):\n\n- Row1, columns0-1 \u2192 set to 2.\n\n- Column1, rows0-1 \u2192 set rows0 and1, column1 to 2.\n\nRow0 column1 becomes 2 (already done), row1 columns0 and1 set to 2.\n\n1 at (1,2):\n\n- Row1, columns0-2 \u2192 set to 2.\n\n- Column2, rows0-1 \u2192 set rows0 and1, column2 to 2.\n\nSo row1 columns0-2 become 2, column2 rows0-1 become 2.\n\n1 at (2,0):\n\n- Row2, columns0-0 \u2192 set to 2.\n\n- Column0, rows0-2 \u2192 set rows0,1,2, column0 to 2.\n\nRow0 column0 becomes 2.\n\nRow1 column0 becomes 2.\n\nRow2 column0 becomes 2.\n\nAfter processing all 1s, the grid is:\n\nRow0: [2 (from 2,0), 2 (from 0,1), 2 (from 1,2)].\n\nRow1: [2 (from 1,1 and 2,0), 2 (from 1,1), 2 (from 1,2)].\n\nRow2: [2 (from 2,0), 0, 0].\n\nBut then we have to set all original 1s to 0:\n\nOriginal 1s are at (0,1), (1,1), (1,2), (2,0).\n\nSo setting these positions to 0:\n\nRow0: [2,0,2].\n\nRow1: [2,0,0].\n\nRow2: [0,0,0].\n\nWait, but according to the example outputs, the output for the test input should be:\n\n[2,2,2]\n\n[0,2,0]\n\n[0,0,0]\n\nBut according to this theory, row0 would have 2 in column2. How?\n\nHmm. Let's re-examine the processing:\n\nFor the test input:\n\n1 at (0,1):\n\n- Row0 columns0-1: set to 2.\n\n- Column1 rows0-0: set row0, column1 to 2.\n\nSo row0 becomes [2,2,0].\n\n1 at (1,1):\n\n- Row1 columns0-1: set columns0 and1 to 2.\n\n- Column1 rows0-1: set rows0 and1, column1 to 2.\n\nSo row0, column1 is already 2. Row1 columns0 and1 become 2.\n\n1 at (1,2):\n\n- Row1 columns0-2: set columns0-2 to 2.\n\n- Column2 rows0-1: set rows0 and1, column2 to 2.\n\nSo row1 becomes [2,2,2] (columns0-2).\n\nRow0, column2 becomes 2 (from column2 rows0-1).\n\nRow2, column2 remains 0.\n\n1 at (2,0):\n\n- Row2 columns0-0: set to 2.\n\n- Column0 rows0-2: set rows0,1,2, column0 to 2.\n\nSo row0 and1, column0 become 2. Row2, column0 becomes 2.\n\nAfter processing:\n\nRow0: [2 (from 2,0 and 0,1), 2 (from 0,1), 2 (from 1,2)].\n\nRow1: [2 (from 1,1 and 2,0), 2 (from 1,1), 2 (from 1,2)].\n\nRow2: [2 (from 2,0), 0, 0].\n\nThen, set original 1s to 0:\n\nOriginal 1s are:\n\n(0,1) \u2192 row0, column1 \u2192 0.\n\n(1,1) \u2192 row1, column1 \u2192 0.\n\n(1,2) \u2192 row1, column2 \u2192 0.\n\n(2,0) \u2192 row2, column0 \u2192 0.\n\nSo the final output is:\n\nRow0: [2,0,2].\n\nRow1: [2,0,0].\n\nRow2: [0,0,0].\n\nBut this doesn't match the expected output. However, looking at Example7 and 8, the output sometimes has 2s in lower rows. For example, Example7's output has a 2 in row1, column1. That might be from a 1 in (1,2) or other positions.\n\nBut according to this theory, the test input's output would have row0 as [2,0,2], which doesn't match what we expect. So perhaps there's another layer to the pattern.\n\nAnother observation: In the outputs, the 2s are only in the first row and sometimes in the second row. For example, Example7's output has a 2 in row1, column1. Which could be due to the 1 at (2,2), which in processing would set column2, rows0-2. But that doesn't explain row1, column1.\n\nThis is really difficult. Given the time I've spent and the pattern in the examples, perhaps the rule is:\n\nEach 1 in the input converts all cells to the left in its row and all cells above in its column into 2s. Then, the original 1s are set to 0. And this process is done for all 1s, with overlapping areas remaining 2.\n\nApplying this to the test input:\n\nTest input:\n\nRow0: [0,1,0]\n\nRow1: [0,1,1]\n\nRow2: [1,0,0]\n\nProcessing each 1:\n\n1 at (0,1):\n\n- Left: columns0,1 \u2192 row0 becomes [2,2,0].\n\n- Above: rows0 \u2192 column1, row0 \u2192 already 2.\n\n1 at (1,1):\n\n- Left: columns0,1 \u2192 row1 becomes [2,2,1].\n\n- Above: rows0,1 \u2192 column1, rows0 and1 \u2192 row0, column1 is 2, row1, column1 is 2.\n\n1 at (1,2):\n\n- Left: columns0,1,2 \u2192 row1 becomes [2,2,2].\n\n- Above: rows0,1 \u2192 column2, rows0 and1 \u2192 row0, column2 is 2, row1, column2 is 2.\n\n1 at (2,0):\n\n- Left: columns0 \u2192 row2 becomes [2,0,0].\n\n- Above: rows0,1,2 \u2192 column0, all rows \u2192 row0 and1, column0 are 2, row2, column0 is 2.\n\nAfter processing all 1s, the grid is:\n\nRow0: [2 (from 2,0 and 0,1), 2 (from 0,1), 2 (from 1,2)].\n\nRow1: [2 (from 2,0 and 1,1), 2 (from 1,1), 2 (from 1,2)].\n\nRow2: [2 (from 2,0), 0, 0].\n\nThen, set original 1s to 0:\n\nOriginal 1s: (0,1), (1,1), (1,2), (2,0).\n\nSo:\n\nRow0: [2,0,2].\n\nRow1: [2,0,0].\n\nRow2: [0,0,0].\n\nBut the expected output is different. However, looking at the training examples like Example6 and 7, when there are multiple 1s in the same row or column, the output can have 2s in lower rows. So perhaps there's another step where the 2s spread further.\n\nAlternatively, after the initial processing, the 2s themselves act as 1s and propagate further. But this would require multiple iterations, which complicates things.\n\nAlternatively, the direction might be different. For example, each 1 propagates to the right and down, but the examples don't show that.\n\nGiven the time constraints and the complexity, I'll proceed with the initial theory, even though it doesn't perfectly fit all examples. However, looking at the test input and some examples like Example6 and 8, the output is likely:\n\n[2,2,2]\n\n[0,2,0]\n\n[0,0,0]\n\nThis matches the pattern where 1s in row1, column1 and column2 contribute to the second row's column1 being 2, possibly due to processing the 1 at (1,1) and (1,2) setting column1 and 2, but after setting original 1s to 0, but other processing steps leave a 2 in row1, column1.\n\nBut based on the previous analysis, this is not explained. Given the time I've spent and the requirement to provide an answer, I'll go with this pattern.",

        "cot_2": "Okay, let's see. I need to figure out the pattern that transforms the input grids into the output grids in the training examples. Let me go through each example step by step and look for similarities or rules.\n\nStarting with Example 0:\nInput:\n[0, 0, 0]\n[1, 0, 0]\n[0, 0, 0]\nOutput:\n[2, 0, 0]\n[0, 0, 0]\n[0, 0, 0]\nHmm. The input has a 1 in the middle of the first row. The output changes that 1 to a 2 and the cell to the left of it (position 0 in the first row) also becomes 2? Wait, no. Wait, the input's 1 is at position [1][0], right? Because the first row is [0,0,0], second row [1,0,0]. So row 1, column 0. The output has a 2 at row 0, column 0. Wait, maybe it's moving up? Or maybe it's counting neighbors?\n\nWait, maybe it's about the cells adjacent to the 1s. Let's check another example.\n\nExample 1:\nInput:\n[0, 1, 0]\n[1, 0, 0]\n[0, 0, 0]\nOutput:\n[2, 2, 0]\n[0, 0, 0]\n[0, 0, 0]\nSo there are two 1s here: one at (0,1) and (1,0). The output has two 2s in the top row. How do they relate? Maybe the 2s are in the positions adjacent to the original 1s. Let's see: the 1 at (0,1) (row 0, column 1) has neighbors to the left and right. But the output is [2,2,0]. So maybe the 1s are replaced by 2s, and their adjacent cells are also turned into 2s? Wait, but in the first example, the 1 was in the second row, first column. Its adjacent cells would be up (row 0, column 0), down (row 2, column 0), left (same cell?), but maybe the rule is that each 1 in the input is replaced by 2, and all cells directly above (if possible) are also turned into 2. Wait, in Example 0, the 1 is in row 1, column 0. The cell above it is row 0, column 0. So that's where the 2 is. So maybe for each 1, you replace it with a 2 and also turn the cell above it into a 2. But then, in Example 1, there are two 1s. Let's check: the first 1 is at (0,1). The cell above it would be out of bounds, so maybe it's ignored. The second 1 is at (1,0). The cell above is (0,0). So combining both, the output's first row would have (0,0) and (0,1) as 2s. Which matches the output [2,2,0]. But wait, the 1 in (0,1) would have the cell above it as ( -1,1) which is invalid, so maybe only the cell below or other directions. Wait, perhaps instead of above, maybe the direction is different. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is created by replacing each 1 in the input with a 2 and then propagating 2s to adjacent cells in some way, but perhaps only upward or leftward. Alternatively, perhaps each 1 in the input causes the cell above it and the cell to the left of it to become 2s. Wait in Example 0, the 1 is at (1,0). Left of it is (1,-1) which is invalid. Above it is (0,0). So the output has (0,0) as 2, and the original 1 is replaced by 2. But in the output of Example 0, the first row is [2,0,0], and the second row is [0,0,0]. So the original 1 (at row 1, column 0) is turned into 0 in the output. Wait, that doesn't fit. Wait the output of Example 0 is:\n[2,0,0]\n[0,0,0]\n[0,0,0]\nOriginal input had a 1 in the second row, first column. But output's second row is all zeros. So the 1 is replaced by 0, but the cell above (row 0, column 0) becomes 2. So maybe the rule is: for each 1 in the input, turn the cell above it into 2. Then remove the original 1. So the original 1s are removed (set to 0), and their above cells are set to 2. Let's test this hypothesis.\n\nExample 0: 1 at (1,0). Above is (0,0) \u2192 set to 2. Original 1 becomes 0. So output matches.\n\nExample 1: two 1s. First at (0,1). Above is out of bounds, so no change. Second at (1,0). Above is (0,0). So (0,0) becomes 2. But the output is [2,2,0]. Hmm, that's two 2s. So this doesn't fit. So maybe the direction isn't up. Let's think again.\n\nLooking at Example 1's input: two 1s at (0,1) and (1,0). Output's first row is [2,2,0]. How could that happen? If the 1s are causing their adjacent cells to become 2s. Let's see: for (0,1), adjacent cells are (0,0), (0,2), (1,1). For (1,0), adjacent cells are (0,0), (1,1), (2,0). If we collect all these cells and set them to 2, but the original 1s are set to 0. But in the output, the first row is [2,2,0], which would suggest that (0,0) and (0,1) are 2s. But (0,1) was the original 1, which is now 0. So that doesn't fit. Alternatively, perhaps the 1s are replaced by 2s, and the cells to the left and above them are also turned into 2s. Let's check.\n\nExample 0: 1 at (1,0). Replace it with 2. Then check left (invalid) and above (0,0) \u2192 set to 2. So output would have (1,0) as 2 and (0,0) as 2. But the output has (0,0) as 2 and (1,0) as 0. So that doesn't fit. So maybe the original 1 is removed (set to 0), and the cell above becomes 2. So in Example 0, yes. But in Example 1, the 1 at (0,1) can't have a cell above (since it's row 0), so only the cell above (1,0) which is (0,0) becomes 2. But the output has two 2s. So that approach doesn't work.\n\nAlternative idea: Maybe the 1s in the input represent sources that spread 2s to all cells to the left and above them, including diagonally. For example, in Example 1, the 1 at (0,1) would spread 2s to the left (0,0) and possibly up (but that's invalid). The 1 at (1,0) would spread to (0,0), (0,-1 invalid). So combined, (0,0) is 2. But the output has (0,0) and (0,1) as 2. Hmm. That doesn't align. So maybe another direction.\n\nLooking at Example 2:\nInput:\n[0,0,1]\n[0,0,0]\n[1,0,0]\nOutput:\n[2,2,0]\n[0,0,0]\n[0,0,0]\nThe input has 1s at (0,2) and (2,0). The output has first row [2,2,0]. So how does that happen? For the 1 at (0,2): if we spread left, then (0,1) and (0,0) would be 2s. For the 1 at (2,0), spreading up would affect (1,0) and (0,0). But in the output, first row has 2s at 0 and 1. So perhaps each 1 spreads 2s to all cells to the left (same row) and all cells above (same column). So for (0,2), left is (0,1) and (0,0). For (2,0), above is (1,0) and (0,0). So combining these, the cells (0,0), (0,1), (0,2) (from first 1) and (0,0), (1,0) (from second 1). But the output's first row is [2,2,0]. So (0,0) and (0,1) are 2s. Wait, but (0,2) was the original 1's position. But in the output, it's 0. So maybe the original 1's cell is set to 0, and the cells to the left and above (all in their row and column) are set to 2, but only if those cells are in the grid. So for (0,2): left cells are (0,1) and (0,0). Those would become 2. The cell above (0,2) is out of bounds. For (2,0): cells above are (1,0) and (0,0). So (1,0) and (0,0) become 2. So combining, (0,0), (0,1), (1,0) would be 2s. But the output's first row is [2,2,0], and the second row is [0,0,0]. So (1,0) is 0. So maybe the 1s are replaced by 0, and their left and above cells are set to 2. But for (2,0), the cells above (1,0) and (0,0) are set to 2. However, in the output, (1,0) is 0, which contradicts. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 1s spread 2s to the left and up, but only in the same row and column, not diagonally. Wait, left in the same row, and up in the same column. For example, a 1 at (row, col) would set all cells to the left (same row, columns 0 to col-1) to 2, and all cells above (same column, rows 0 to row-1) to 2. Then the original 1 is set to 0.\n\nLet's test this with Example 0:\n\nInput 1 is at (1,0). Left of it in the same row (row 1) is columns 0-0 (since col is 0, left is nothing). Above it (same column 0, rows 0 to 0) is row 0. So set row 0, column 0 to 2. So output's row 0 has [2,0,0]. The original 1 becomes 0. Which matches the output.\n\nExample 1: 1s at (0,1) and (1,0).\n\nFor (0,1):\n\nLeft in same row: columns 0 and 1 (but col is 1, so left is 0). So set (0,0) to 2.\n\nAbove it: column 1, rows 0 to -1 (invalid, so nothing).\n\nFor (1,0):\n\nLeft in row 1: column 0, but col is 0 \u2192 nothing.\n\nAbove: column 0, rows 0. So set (0,0) to 2.\n\nCombined, (0,0) is 2. But the output is [2,2,0]. So this doesn't explain the second 2. So maybe this approach is wrong.\n\nAnother idea: Maybe the 1s act as sources that \"light up\" their row to the left and their column upwards, setting those cells to 2. So for a 1 in (row, col), all cells to the left in the same row (from 0 to col) and all cells above in the same column (from 0 to row) become 2. But then, in Example 0:\n\n1 is at (1,0). So left in row 1: column 0 (since col is 0, only that cell). But original cell is 1. But in the output, (0,0) is 2. So this doesn't fit.\n\nWait, maybe the cells to the left (including the original cell's position) and above (including original) are set to 2. But then for (1,0), left in row 1 is only (1,0). But original cell is set to 0 in the output. So that's conflicting.\n\nAlternative approach: Let's look at the outputs and see if there's a pattern in the number of 2s. For example:\n\nExample 0: 1 2.\n\nExample 1: 2 2s.\n\nExample 2: 2 2s.\n\nExample 3: 2 2s.\n\nExample 4: 1 2.\n\nExample 5: 3 2s.\n\nHmm, maybe the number of 2s in the output depends on the positions of the 1s in the input. Let's see:\n\nIn Example 5:\n\nInput:\n[1,1,0]\n[0,0,0]\n[1,0,0]\n\nOutput:\n[2,2,2]\n[0,0,0]\n[0,0,0]\n\nSo three 1s. Output has three 2s in the top row. How?\n\nPerhaps each 1 in the input contributes to some area in the output. For example, the 1s are in (0,0), (0,1), (2,0). The output's top row is all 2s. So maybe each 1 in the input causes certain cells in the output to become 2, possibly overlapping. For example, the 1 at (0,0) would affect its own row and column. But in the output, the entire first row is 2s.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output's first row is the sum of the left and up directions from all 1s.\n\nAlternatively, think of it as the 1s projecting their influence upwards and to the left. So for each 1 in the input grid, all cells that are to the left of it (in the same row) and above it (in the same column) are turned into 2s. Then, any cell that is covered by at least one 1's influence becomes a 2. The original 1s are turned into 0.\n\nLet's test this with Example 0:\n\nThe 1 is at (1,0). Cells to the left in the same row (row 1): none (since col 0). Cells above in the same column (col 0) are rows 0. So row 0, col 0 becomes 2. The output is [2,0,0] in the first row. Correct.\n\nExample 1: 1s at (0,1) and (1,0).\n\nFor (0,1): left in row 0 are cols 0 and 1 (but wait, to the left of col 1 are cols 0. So cells (0,0). Above in column 1: rows 0 (since it's already in row 0). So no cells above.\n\nFor (1,0): left in row 1: none. Above in column 0: row 0.\n\nSo combining, cells (0,0) and (0,0) again (since both 1s contribute to (0,0)). So output's first row is [2,2,0]. Wait, but according to this, only (0,0) would be 2. But the output has [2,2,0]. So this is conflicting.\n\nHmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding the direction. Maybe for each 1, all cells to the left (including itself) and all cells above (including itself) are turned to 2. But then overlapping cells would still be 2.\n\nWait in Example 1:\n\n1 at (0,1): cells to the left in row 0: columns 0 and 1. So (0,0) and (0,1). But the 1 is at (0,1), so left includes itself? Or to the left (columns less than current). Similarly, cells above in column 1: rows 0 (same as current). So maybe the 1's own cell is also converted to 2. But in the output, the original 1s are 0. So maybe the original 1s are turned to 0, and their left and above cells are set to 2.\n\nWait this is getting confusing. Let's try a different approach. Let's look for examples where multiple 1s contribute to overlapping 2s.\n\nTake Example 5: Input has 1s at (0,0), (0,1), (2,0). Output's first row is all 2s. So each 1 must be causing some spread. Let's see:\n\n1 at (0,0): left in row 0 (columns 0) \u2192 nothing to the left. Above in column 0 (rows 0) \u2192 nothing above. So maybe this 1's influence is only itself, but since it's turned to 0, maybe no effect. Wait this isn't making sense. Alternatively, perhaps the 1 at (0,0) can't influence anything because there's nothing to the left or above. So why does the output have 2s in (0,0) and (0,1) and (0,2)?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 1s are being replaced by 2s in their own positions, and the cells to the right and below are turned to 2. But in Example 0, the 1 is replaced by 0, not 2.\n\nThis is tricky. Let's look at Example 7:\n\nInput:\n[1,1,0]\n[0,0,0]\n[1,0,1]\n\nOutput:\n[2,2,2]\n[0,2,0]\n[0,0,0]\n\nOriginal 1s are at (0,0), (0,1), (2,0), (2,2). Output's first row is all 2s. Second row's middle cell is 2. Third row is zeros. So how does this happen? The 2s in the first row could be influenced by the 1s in the first row. The 2 in the second row's middle (1,1) might be influenced by some other 1. But how?\n\nWait, maybe the pattern is that each 1 in the input converts all cells in the same row to the left and all cells in the same column above into 2s. Then, the 1s are set to 0.\n\nSo for each 1 at (r,c), all cells in row r from column 0 to c (inclusive?) are set to 2, and all cells in column c from row 0 to r (inclusive?) are set to 2. But the original 1 is set to 0.\n\nLet's test this with Example 5:\n\nInput 1s at (0,0), (0,1), (2,0).\n\nFor (0,0):\n\n- row 0, columns 0-0 \u2192 set (0,0) to 2.\n\n- column 0, rows 0-0 \u2192 set (0,0) to 2.\n\nBut since the original 1 is set to 0, so after processing, (0,0) would be 0. But other cells influenced by other 1s might set it to 2.\n\nWait, maybe overlapping regions from multiple 1s. Let's see:\n\nProcessing (0,0):\n\n- row 0, columns 0 to 0 (inclusive) \u2192 (0,0).\n\n- column 0, rows 0 to 0 \u2192 (0,0).\n\nBut since we set these to 2, but then original 1 becomes 0. So (0,0) is 0.\n\nProcessing (0,1):\n\n- row 0, columns 0-1 \u2192 (0,0), (0,1).\n\n- column 1, rows 0-0 \u2192 (0,1).\n\nSo (0,0) and (0,1) become 2.\n\nProcessing (2,0):\n\n- row 2, columns 0-0 \u2192 (2,0).\n\n- column 0, rows 0-2 \u2192 (0,0), (1,0), (2,0).\n\nSo these cells become 2.\n\nBut in the output, the first row is [2,2,2], second row [0,0,0], third row [0,0,0]. Hmm, this doesn't fit. Because according to this, (0,0) would be set by the second 1 (0,1), and (0,0) and (0,1) become 2. The third 1 (2,0) would set (2,0) and column 0 rows 0-2. So (0,0), (1,0), (2,0) become 2. Combining all, the first row would have (0,0) and (0,1) as 2, and (0,0) again from the third 1. So first row becomes 2,2,0 (since third column isn't touched). But the output is [2,2,2]. So this doesn't align.\n\nAlternative idea: Perhaps the 1s are replaced by 2s in the cell directly above them, and then those 2s propagate similarly. But this seems like a chain reaction, which isn't obvious in the examples.\n\nLooking at Example 7's output, the second row has a 2 in (1,1). How could that happen? Input 1s are in (0,0), (0,1), (2,0), (2,2). For (2,2), maybe the cell above (1,2) would be set to 2, but the output's second row is [0,2,0]. So (1,1) is 2. How does that come about? It's possible that the 1s influence diagonal directions. For example, each 1 spreads to all eight surrounding cells. But then why in Example 0, only the cell above is set. Hmm, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the sum of all cells that are in the same row or column as any 1, but only to the left or above the 1. So for each 1, all cells in the same row to the left and all cells in the same column above are set to 2.\n\nSo combining all 1s' influence:\n\nFor each cell (r,c) in the output, if there's any 1 in the input at (R,C) where R >= r and C >= c, then (r,c) becomes 2.\n\nWait, let's test this with Example 0:\n\nInput has 1 at (1,0). So any cell (r,c) where R >= r and C >= c for R=1, C=0. So cells where r <=1 and c <=0. So rows 0 and 1, columns 0. So cells (0,0), (1,0). But the output is [2,0,0], [0,0,0]. So only (0,0) is 2. Hmm, that doesn't fit. So perhaps this isn't the rule.\n\nAnother approach: Looking at the outputs, the 2s seem to form a sort of \"shadow\" to the left and above the original 1s. Like, imagine the 1s as light sources, and the 2s are the cells illuminated to the left and above. So for each 1, all cells to the left in the same row and all cells above in the same column become 2. But overlapping areas would be covered once by any 1.\n\nLet's test this with Example 1:\n\nInput 1s at (0,1) and (1,0).\n\nFor (0,1):\n\n- Left in row 0: columns 0 and 1 (since left includes current cell?), but original cell is set to 0. Wait, if the rule is that the 1's cell is set to 0, but the cells to the left and above (but not including the 1's cell) are set to 2.\n\nSo for (0,1):\n\n- Left cells in row 0: columns 0 (since current is 1, left is 0).\n\n- Above cells in column 1: rows 0 (but since it's in row 0, nothing above).\n\nSo (0,0) becomes 2.\n\nFor (1,0):\n\n- Left in row 1: columns 0 (nothing left of column 0).\n\n- Above cells in column 0: rows 0.\n\nSo (0,0) becomes 2.\n\nSo combining both, (0,0) is 2. But the output is [2,2,0]. So this doesn't fit.\n\nBut according to the output, there's a 2 at (0,1) as well. So maybe the current cell's column is also included. Like, for each 1 at (r,c), set all cells in row r from column 0 to c (inclusive) and all cells in column c from row 0 to r (inclusive) to 2. Then set the original 1 to 0.\n\nTesting Example 0:\n\n1 at (1,0).\n\nRow 1, columns 0-0 \u2192 (1,0) \u2192 set to 2.\n\nColumn 0, rows 0-1 \u2192 (0,0), (1,0) \u2192 set to 2.\n\nBut original 1 is set to 0, so (1,0) becomes 0.\n\nSo the cells set are (0,0) and (1,0) (which is then 0). So output's first row would have (0,0) as 2, and second row (1,0) as 0. Which matches Example 0's output.\n\nExample 1:\n\n1s at (0,1) and (1,0).\n\nProcessing (0,1):\n\nRow 0, columns 0-1 \u2192 (0,0), (0,1) \u2192 set to 2.\n\nColumn 1, rows 0-0 \u2192 (0,1) \u2192 set to 2.\n\nThen set (0,1) to 0.\n\nSo after this, the cells (0,0) and (0,1) are 2, but (0,1) becomes 0. Wait, no. Because the rule would first set those cells to 2, then the original 1 is set to 0. So the processing steps would be:\n\nFor each 1 in the input:\n\n1. Mark all cells in the same row to the left (including current) as 2.\n\n2. Mark all cells in the same column above (including current) as 2.\n\n3. Set the original 1 to 0.\n\nBut if multiple 1s are present, their marks would overlap.\n\nSo in Example 1:\n\nProcessing (0,1):\n\nRow 0, 0-1 \u2192 (0,0) and (0,1) are 2.\n\nColumn 1, 0-0 \u2192 (0,1) is 2.\n\nSo after marking, (0,0) and (0,1) are 2.\n\nThen set (0,1) to 0. So the final output has (0,0) as 2, (0,1) as 0. But the actual output is [2,2,0]. This doesn't fit.\n\nSo this approach isn't working.\n\nAlternative idea: Maybe the 2s are in all cells that are in the same row as any 1, to the left of the rightmost 1 in that row, and in the same column as any 1, above the lowest 1 in that column.\n\nLet's see:\n\nFor each row, find the rightmost 1. All cells to the left of it (inclusive) become 2.\n\nFor each column, find the lowest 1. All cells above it (inclusive) become 2.\n\nThen, all original 1s are set to 0.\n\nLet's test this with Example 1:\n\nRow 0 has a 1 at column 1 (rightmost). So row 0, columns 0-1 become 2.\n\nRow 1 has a 1 at column 0 (rightmost). So row 1, columns 0-0 become 2.\n\nColumns:\n\nColumn 0's lowest 1 is at row 1. So rows 0-1 become 2.\n\nColumn 1's lowest 1 is at row 0. So rows 0-0 become 2.\n\nColumn 2 has no 1s.\n\nCombining, in row 0, columns 0-1 are 2 (from row 0's rightmost 1) and column 0's rows 0-1 (so row 0, column 0 is 2). So output row 0 would be [2,2,0].\n\nRow 1: from row 1's rightmost 1 (column 0), columns 0-0 become 2, but column 0's rows 0-1 are also 2. So row 1, column 0 is 2. But the output has row 1 as [0,0,0]. So this doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. Maybe this approach is also incorrect.\n\nLet me look at Example 5's input and output:\n\nInput:\n\n[1,1,0]\n\n[0,0,0]\n\n[1,0,0]\n\nOutput:\n\n[2,2,2]\n\n[0,0,0]\n\n[0,0,0]\n\nAccording to this, the first row is all 2s. How does that happen?\n\nIf for row 0, the rightmost 1 is at column 1. So row 0, columns 0-1 are 2. But the output has column 2 as 2 as well. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternative idea: Maybe the 2s are the union of all cells to the left and above each 1. So for each 1 at (r,c), all cells (i,j) where i <= r and j <= c are set to 2. Then, original 1s are set to 0.\n\nLet's test this:\n\nExample 0:\n\n1 at (1,0). So cells where i <=1 and j <=0 \u2192 rows 0-1, column 0. These become 2. Then original 1 is set to 0. Output first row [2,0,0], second row [0,0,0]. Which matches.\n\nExample 1:\n\n1s at (0,1) and (1,0).\n\nFor (0,1): cells i <=0, j <=1 \u2192 row 0, columns 0-1.\n\nFor (1,0): cells i <=1, j <=0 \u2192 rows 0-1, column 0.\n\nCombined, the cells are:\n\nRow 0: columns 0-1.\n\nRow 1: column 0.\n\nSo output first row is [2,2,0], second row [2,0,0]. But the actual output is first row [2,2,0], second row [0,0,0]. So this doesn't fit. The second row, column 0 would be 2 according to this rule, but the actual output is 0.\n\nHmm, so maybe this approach is not correct.\n\nWait, perhaps the original 1s are set to 0, and the cells that are strictly to the left and above the 1s are set to 2. So for a 1 at (r,c), all cells (i,j) where i < r and j < c. But that would not include the same row or column.\n\nExample 0: 1 at (1,0). So cells where i <1 (row 0) and j <0 (invalid). So no cells. So output would have no 2s, which contradicts. So this can't be.\n\nAlternative approach: Maybe the 2s are formed by creating a kind of \"union\" of all cells that are either in the same row as a 1 and to the left of it, or in the same column as a 1 and above it. The original 1s are set to 0.\n\nExample 0:\n\n1 at (1,0). Cells in row 1 to the left of column 0: none. Cells in column 0 above row 1 (i.e., row 0). So (0,0) becomes 2. Output matches.\n\nExample 1:\n\n1s at (0,1) and (1,0).\n\nFor (0,1):\n\n- Left in row 0: columns 0.\n\n- Above in column 1: no cells.\n\nSo (0,0).\n\nFor (1,0):\n\n- Left in row 1: columns 0 is same as current, so none.\n\n- Above in column 0: row 0.\n\nSo (0,0).\n\nSo combining, (0,0) and (0,0), so only (0,0) is 2. But output is [2,2,0]. So this doesn't fit.\n\nBut the output has (0,1) as 2. So why is that?\n\nWait, perhaps the cells to the left of the 1 in its row, including the 1's position, and the cells above including the 1's position are all set to 2. But then the 1's position is set to 0.\n\nSo for a 1 at (r,c):\n\n- In its row, columns 0 to c (inclusive) \u2192 set to 2.\n\n- In its column, rows 0 to r (inclusive) \u2192 set to 2.\n\nBut then, since the original 1 is set to 0, overlapping cells from other 1s may still be 2.\n\nExample 1:\n\n1 at (0,1):\n\n- row 0, columns 0-1 \u2192 set to 2.\n\n- column 1, rows 0-0 \u2192 set to 2.\n\nSo cells (0,0), (0,1) are 2.\n\n1 at (1,0):\n\n- row 1, columns 0-0 \u2192 set to 2.\n\n- column 0, rows 0-1 \u2192 set to 2.\n\nSo cells (0,0), (1,0) are 2.\n\nNow, after setting all these to 2, the original 1s are set to 0.\n\nSo the output would be:\n\nRow 0: (0,0) and (0,1) are 2 \u2192 [2,2,0].\n\nRow 1: (1,0) is set to 0 \u2192 but during processing, it was set to 2, but then original 1 is 0. So row 1, column 0 is 0.\n\nThus, output matches Example 1's output.\n\nThis seems promising. Let's test this hypothesis with other examples.\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput:\n\n[0,0,1]\n\n[0,0,0]\n\n[1,0,0]\n\nOutput:\n\n[2,2,0]\n\n[0,0,0]\n\n[0,0,0]\n\nThe 1s are at (0,2) and (2,0).\n\nProcessing (0,2):\n\n- row 0, columns 0-2 \u2192 set all to 2.\n\n- column 2, rows 0-0 \u2192 set (0,2) to 2.\n\nProcessing (2,0):\n\n- row 2, columns 0-0 \u2192 set (2,0) to 2.\n\n- column 0, rows 0-2 \u2192 set (0,0), (1,0), (2,0) to 2.\n\nNow, after setting:\n\nRow 0: columns 0-2 are 2.\n\nRow 2: column 0 is 2.\n\nColumn 0: all rows 0-2 are 2.\n\nBut original 1s are set to 0.\n\nSo after processing:\n\nRow 0 becomes [2,2,0] (since (0,2) was set to 2 but then turned to 0 because it was the original 1).\n\nRow 2, column 0 becomes 0.\n\nBut according to the output, row 0 is [2,2,0], which matches. Row 2 is all zeros. So this works.\n\nExample 5:\n\nInput:\n\n[1,1,0]\n\n[0,0,0]\n\n[1,0,0]\n\nOutput:\n\n[2,2,2]\n\n[0,0,0]\n\n[0,0,0]\n\nProcessing each 1:\n\nFirst 1 at (0,0):\n\n- row 0, columns 0-0 \u2192 set to 2.\n\n- column 0, rows 0-0 \u2192 set to 2.\n\nSecond 1 at (0,1):\n\n- row 0, columns 0-1 \u2192 set to 2.\n\n- column 1, rows 0-0 \u2192 set to 2.\n\nThird 1 at (2,0):\n\n- row 2, columns 0-0 \u2192 set to 2.\n\n- column 0, rows 0-2 \u2192 set to 2.\n\nSo after processing, before setting original 1s to 0:\n\nRow 0: columns 0-1 are 2 (from first two 1s) and column 0-2 from row 0's third 1's column processing? Wait, no. Let's clarify:\n\nEach 1's processing affects its row and column:\n\nFor (0,0):\n\nRow 0, columns 0-0 \u2192 2.\n\nColumn 0, rows 0-0 \u2192 2.\n\nFor (0,1):\n\nRow 0, columns 0-1 \u2192 2.\n\nColumn 1, rows 0-0 \u2192 2.\n\nFor (2,0):\n\nRow 2, columns 0-0 \u2192 2.\n\nColumn 0, rows 0-2 \u2192 2.\n\nSo combining:\n\nRow 0:\n\nColumns 0-1 are 2 (from (0,0) and (0,1) processing). Also, column 0 in row 0 is also set by (2,0) processing.\n\nRow 0, column 2: not affected.\n\nColumn 0:\n\nRows 0-2 are set to 2 by (2,0) processing. Also, (0,0) and (2,0) contribute.\n\nSo after setting all these, row 0's columns 0-1 are 2, column 0's rows 0-2 are 2. So row 0, column 2 is 0. But the output is [2,2,2]. This doesn't fit.\n\nWait, but maybe the third 1's row processing is row 2, columns 0-0, which sets (2,0) to 2. But that cell is set to 0 later because it's a original 1. So how does row 0, column 2 become 2?\n\nHmm, this suggests my hypothesis is incorrect.\n\nBut the output for Example 5 is [2,2,2] in the first row. So there's a 2 in column 2 of row 0. How does that happen under this rule?\n\nMaybe there's another rule I'm missing. Let me think again.\n\nAlternative idea: Maybe the 2s are all cells that are in the same row as any 1 to the left of any 1 in that row, and the same column as any 1 above any 1 in that column.\n\nFor example, for a row with multiple 1s, the leftmost 1 determines the columns to be filled. Or the rightmost 1 determines up to which column to fill. Similarly, for a column with multiple 1s, the highest 1 determines up to which row to fill.\n\nWait, Example 5's first row has 1s at columns 0 and 1. The rightmost is column 1. So all cells in row 0 up to column 1 are 2. But output's first row has 2s up to column 2. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, if the leftmost 1 in a row determines the entire row to be filled. But in Example 5's first row, there are 1s at 0 and 1. So the entire row would be filled. But output's first row is all 2s. So maybe the presence of any 1 in a row fills the entire row with 2s. Similarly, any 1 in a column fills the entire column with 2s. Then, original 1s are set to 0.\n\nLet's test this:\n\nExample 0:\n\nRow 1 has a 1. So entire row 1 is filled with 2s. Column 0 has a 1. So entire column 0 is filled with 2s. The intersection of row 1 and column 0 is set to 0 (original 1). So output would have row 0, column 0 as 2 (from column fill), row 1 filled with 2s. But the actual output is row 0, column 0 as 2 and row 1 as zeros. So this doesn't fit.\n\nExample 5:\n\nRows 0 and 2 have 1s. So entire rows 0 and 2 are filled with 2s. Columns 0 and 1 (from row 0's 1s) and column 0 (from row 2's 1) are filled. So rows 0 and 2 are all 2s, and columns 0 and 1 are all 2s. So the entire grid would be 2s except where original 1s were. But the output has row 0 as all 2s, rows 1 and 2 as zeros. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAnother angle: Let's look for the pattern in the Test Input.\n\nTest Input:\n[0,1,0]\n[0,1,1]\n[1,0,0]\n\nAccording to the rule I thought of earlier (each 1 causes all cells to the left in its row and above in its column to be 2, then 1s are set to 0):\n\nProcessing each 1:\n\n1. (0,1):\n\n- Row 0, columns 0-1 \u2192 2.\n\n- Column 1, rows 0-0 \u2192 2.\n\nSo cells (0,0), (0,1) \u2192 2.\n\n2. (1,1):\n\n- Row 1, columns 0-1 \u2192 2.\n\n- Column 1, rows 0-1 \u2192 2.\n\nSo cells (1,0), (1,1), (0,1) \u2192 2.\n\n3. (1,2):\n\n- Row 1, columns 0-2 \u2192 2.\n\n- Column 2, rows 0-1 \u2192 2.\n\nSo cells (1,0), (1,1), (1,2), (0,2), (1,2) \u2192 2.\n\n4. (2,0):\n\n- Row 2, columns 0-0 \u2192 2.\n\n- Column 0, rows 0-2 \u2192 2.\n\nSo cells (0,0), (1,0), (2,0) \u2192 2.\n\nNow, combining all these:\n\nRow 0:\n\n- From (0,1): 0,0 and 0,1.\n\n- From (1,1): 0,1.\n\n- From (1,2): 0,2.\n\n- From (2,0): 0,0.\n\nSo row 0: 0,0 \u2192 2; 0,1 \u2192 2; 0,2 \u2192 2.\n\nRow 1:\n\n- From (1,1): 1,0 and 1,1.\n\n- From (1,2): 1,0, 1,1, 1,2.\n\n- From (2,0): 1,0.\n\nSo row 1: 0,0, 1,0; 1,1; 1,2 \u2192 all 2.\n\nRow 2:\n\n- From (2,0): 2,0.\n\nSo row 2: 2,0.\n\nBut after setting original 1s to 0:\n\nTest Input's 1s are at (0,1), (1,1), (1,2), (2,0).\n\nSo after processing, those positions become 0.\n\nSo the final output would be:\n\nRow 0: [2, 0, 2] (since (0,1) was set to 2 but then turned to 0).\n\nRow 1: [2, 0, 0] (since (1,1) and (1,2) are set to 0).\n\nRow 2: [0, 0, 0] (since (2,0) is set to 0).\n\nBut according to the training examples, the output for similar cases often has 2s in the upper rows. But the expected output for the test input is unclear. However, according to the pattern observed in the examples, when there are multiple 1s, the 2s seem to aggregate in the upper rows.\n\nLooking back at Example 7:\n\nInput:\n[1,1,0]\n[0,0,0]\n[1,0,1]\n\nOutput:\n[2,2,2]\n[0,2,0]\n[0,0,0]\n\nAccording to the rule where each 1's row left and column above are filled with 2s, then:\n\nFor (0,0): row 0, columns 0-0 \u2192 2; column 0, rows 0-0 \u2192 2.\n\nFor (0,1): row 0, columns 0-1 \u2192 2; column 1, rows 0-0 \u2192 2.\n\nFor (2,0): row 2, columns 0-0 \u2192 2; column 0, rows 0-2 \u2192 2.\n\nFor (2,2): row 2, columns 0-2 \u2192 2; column 2, rows 0-2 \u2192 2.\n\nSo after processing:\n\nRow 0: columns 0-1 are 2 (from (0,0) and (0,1)), and column 0 is also set from (2,0)'s column processing. Column 2 is set from (2,2)'s column processing (rows 0-2). So row 0, column 2 is 2.\n\nRow 1: column 0 (from (2,0)) and column 2 (from (2,2)) \u2192 rows 1, columns 0 and 2 are 2. But original 1s are in row 0 and 2, so row 1's cells are 2 except if set by other rules. \n\nBut the output for Example 7's second row is [0,2,0]. This suggests that there's a 2 in (1,1). How does that happen under the current rule?\n\nThis is getting too complicated. Maybe I need to find another pattern.\n\nLooking at the outputs, the 2s seem to form a kind of rectangle covering the top-left area affected by the 1s. Perhaps the output is determined by the maximum row and column indices of the 1s. For example:\n\nThe output's 2s fill all cells (i,j) where i <= max_row and j <= max_col, where max_row is the highest row index of any 1, and max_col is the highest column index of any 1. But this doesn't fit the examples.\n\nAlternatively, the 2s are determined by the minimum row and column of the 1s. Not sure.\n\nLet me try a different approach. Let's compare the test input with Example 8:\n\nExample 8's input:\n[0,1,0]\n[1,1,0]\n[1,0,0]\n\nOutput:\n[2,2,2]\n[0,2,0]\n[0,0,0]\n\nThe test input is:\n[0,1,0]\n[0,1,1]\n[1,0,0]\n\nComparing, the test input has 1s in (0,1), (1,1), (1,2), (2,0). Example 8's input has 1s in (0,1), (1,0), (1,1), (2,0).\n\nThe output for Example 8 is first row all 2s, second row [0,2,0], third row 0s. \n\nIn Example 8's processing, the 1s in (0,1) and (1,1) likely contribute to the second row's middle 2.\n\nIn the test input, perhaps the presence of a 1 in (1,2) would cause the second row's third column to be considered. But the output in Example 7's case with a 1 in (2,2) leads to a 2 in column 2 of row 0.\n\nBut according to the pattern where each 1's row and column are filled to the left and above, then in the test input:\n\n- (0,1) fills row 0 columns 0-1 and column 1 row 0.\n\n- (1,1) fills row 1 columns 0-1 and column 1 rows 0-1.\n\n- (1,2) fills row 1 columns 0-2 and column 2 rows 0-1.\n\n- (2,0) fills row 2 columns 0-0 and column 0 rows 0-2.\n\nSo combining:\n\nRow 0: columns 0-1 (from (0,1)), column 0 (from (2,0)), column 2 (from (1,2) column 2 rows 0-1) \u2192 so columns 0-2 are 2.\n\nRow 1: columns 0-1 (from (1,1)), columns 0-2 (from (1,2)), column 0 (from (2,0)), column 1 (from (1,1) and (0,1)), column 2 (from (1,2)).\n\nSo row 1 would have all 2s.\n\nRow 2: column 0 (from (2,0)), which is set to 0 because it's an original 1.\n\nBut the output for Example 8 has row 1 as [0,2,0], so perhaps the original 1s in row 1 are set to 0.\n\nSo in the test input's output:\n\nRow 0: all 2s.\n\nRow 1: columns 0-2 are 2, but original 1s are set to 0. So (1,1) and (1,2) become 0. So row 1 would have [2,0,0], but that doesn't fit with previous examples.\n\nThis is getting too time-consuming. Perhaps I should look for a pattern where the output is formed by setting to 2 all cells that are in the same row as any 1 but to the left of the rightmost 1 in that row, and in the same column as any 1 but above the lowest 1 in that column. Then, original 1s are set to 0.\n\nFor the test input:\n\nRightmost 1 in row 0 is at column 1.\n\nLeft of that: columns 0-1 \u2192 2.\n\nRightmost in row 1 is column 2 \u2192 columns 0-2 \u2192 2.\n\nRightmost in row 2 is column 0 \u2192 columns 0 \u2192 2.\n\nFor columns:\n\nLowest 1 in column 0 is row 2 \u2192 rows 0-2 \u2192 2.\n\nLowest 1 in column 1 is row 1 \u2192 rows 0-1 \u2192 2.\n\nLowest 1 in column 2 is row 1 \u2192 rows 0-1 \u2192 2.\n\nSo combining row and column fills:\n\nRow 0: columns 0-1 (from row) and columns 0-2 (from columns 0,1,2) \u2192 so row 0 is all 2s.\n\nRow 1: columns 0-2 (from row) and rows 0-1 for columns 0-2 \u2192 row 1 is all 2s.\n\nRow 2: columns 0 (from row) and rows 0-2 for column 0 \u2192 row 2, column 0 is 2.\n\nThen set original 1s to 0. So:\n\nRow 0, column 1 becomes 0.\n\nRow 1, columns 1 and 2 become 0.\n\nRow 2, column 0 becomes 0.\n\nSo the final output would be:\n\nRow 0: [2,0,2]\n\nRow 1: [2,0,0]\n\nRow 2: [0,0,0]\n\nBut this doesn't match any of the training examples. However, looking back at Example 7's output, which has a 2 in row 1, column 1 despite the original 1s in row 0 and 2, perhaps there's a different pattern.\n\nAnother possibility is that the 2s are in the cells that are in the convex hull of all 1s, considering the grid as a coordinate system. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, considering the output as the union of all cells that are to the left and/or above any of the 1s. For each 1, all cells to the left in the same row and all cells above in the same column are set to 2.\n\nTest input has 1s at (0,1), (1,1), (1,2), (2,0).\n\nFor each 1:\n\n- (0,1): left cells (0,0), and above (none).\n\n- (1,1): left cells (1,0), and above cells (0,1).\n\n- (1,2): left cells (1,0), (1,1), and above cells (0,2).\n\n- (2,0): left cells none, above cells (0,0), (1,0).\n\nSo combining all cells:\n\n(0,0), (0,1), (0,2), (1,0), (1,1), (2,0) are set to 2. Original 1s are set to 0.\n\nSo output:\n\nRow 0: [2,0,2]\n\nRow 1: [0,0,0] (since (1,0) and (1,1) are 2 but original 1s at (1,1) and (1,2) set to 0. Wait, (1,0) would be 2 from (1,1) and (2,0) processing, but (1,0) is not an original 1. So row 1, column 0 is 2. Similarly, row 1, column 1 is set by (1,1) to 2 but then set to 0 because it's a original 1.\n\nThis is getting too complicated. Given the time I've spent and the need to provide an answer, I'll try to summarize the pattern I think is correct based on the training examples.\n\nThe pattern seems to be:\n\nFor each cell in the input grid, if there is any 1 in the same row to the right or in the same column below, then the cell is set to 2. Otherwise, it's 0. All original 1s are set to 0.\n\nAlternatively, the output is the set of all cells that are to the left of a 1 in their row or above a 1 in their column.\n\nSo for each cell (i,j), if there exists a 1 in the same row at column > j, or a 1 in the same column at row > i, then cell (i,j) is 2. Otherwise, 0.\n\nTesting this with Example 0:\n\nInput 1 at (1,0). For cell (0,0):\n\n- In row 0, are there any 1s to the right (columns >0)? No.\n\n- In column 0, any 1s below row 0? Yes, at row 1.\n\nSo cell (0,0) is 2. All other cells don't meet the criteria. So output matches.\n\nExample 1:\n\nInput 1s at (0,1) and (1,0).\n\nFor cell (0,0):\n\n- In row 0, any 1s to the right (column >0): yes, at column 1.\n\nSo cell (0,0) is 2.\n\nFor cell (0,1):\n\n- In row 0, to the right: no.\n\n- In column 1, below: no.\n\nSo cell (0,1) is 0.\n\nBut the output has (0,1) as 2. So this doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. Maybe the rule is that a cell is 2 if there's a 1 in the same row to the right or in the same column below, including the current cell's position. But then (0,1) in Example 1 has a 1 in the same row at (0,1), which is to the right of (0,0), but the cell itself is (0,1). So maybe:\n\nA cell (i,j) is 2 if there's a 1 in the same row at column >= j, or a 1 in the same column at row >= i.\n\nBut this would include the cell itself. Then:\n\nFor Example 1's cell (0,1):\n\n- Has a 1 in the same row at column 1 (itself), which is >=1 \u2192 yes.\n\n- Column 1, any 1 >=0 \u2192 yes.\n\nSo cell (0,1) is 2. But in the output, it's 0 because it's an original 1. So this approach may not account for the original 1s being set to 0.\n\nAlternatively, the rule is that a cell is 2 if there's a 1 to the right in its row (columns >j) or below in its column (rows >i).\n\nThen, original 1s are set to 0.\n\nTesting Example 0:\n\nCell (0,0) \u2192 any 1 to right in row 0 (no), any below in column 0 (yes, row 1). So 2.\n\nCell (1,0) is original 1 \u2192 set to 0.\n\nOther cells: no.\n\nOutput matches.\n\nExample 1:\n\nInput 1s at (0,1) and (1,0).\n\nCell (0,0):\n\n- In row 0: any 1 to right (yes, at column 1).\n\n- So 2.\n\nCell (0,1):\n\n- Original 1 \u2192 0.\n\nCell (0,0) is 2.\n\nCell (0,1) is 0.\n\nCell (0,0) is 2, cell (0,1) is 0. But output has [2,2,0].\n\nSo this doesn't fit. So this rule is incorrect.\n\nAt this point, given the time I've invested and the complexity, I think the best approach is to assume that the output is generated by replacing each 1 with 0 and setting all cells to the left in the same row and all cells above in the same column to 2. Thus, for each 1, you mark the entire row to the left and entire column above (including the current cell) as 2, then set the original 1s to 0. \n\nApplying this to the test input:\n\nTest Input:\n[0,1,0]\n[0,1,1]\n[1,0,0]\n\nProcessing each 1:\n\n1. (0,1):\n\n- Row 0, columns 0-1 \u2192 set to 2.\n\n- Column 1, rows 0-0 \u2192 set to 2.\n\n2. (1,1):\n\n- Row 1, columns 0-1 \u2192 set to 2.\n\n- Column 1, rows 0-1 \u2192 set to 2.\n\n3. (1,2):\n\n- Row 1, columns 0-2 \u2192 set to 2.\n\n- Column 2, rows 0-1 \u2192 set to 2.\n\n4. (2,0):\n\n- Row 2, columns 0-0 \u2192 set to 2.\n\n- Column 0, rows 0-2 \u2192 set to 2.\n\nAfter marking:\n\nRow 0:\n\n- Columns 0-1 (from (0,1)), columns 0-2 (from (2,0)'s column 0), columns 2 (from (1,2)'s column 2).\n\nBut processing (0,1) sets row 0 columns 0-1 to 2, and (1,2) sets column 2 rows 0-1 to 2. So row 0 becomes [2,2,2].\n\nRow 1:\n\n- Columns 0-1 (from (1,1)), columns 0-2 (from (1,2)), and column 0 (from (2,0)'s column processing). So row 1 is [2,2,2].\n\nRow 2:\n\n- Column 0 (from (2,0)), which is set to 2.\n\nThen, set original 1s to 0:\n\n- (0,1) \u2192 0.\n\n- (1,1) \u2192 0.\n\n- (1,2) \u2192 0.\n\n- (2,0) \u2192 0.\n\nSo the final output would be:\n\nRow 0: [2,0,2]\n\nRow 1: [2,0,0]\n\nRow 2: [0,0,0]\n\nBut looking at Example 6's output, which has three 2s in the first row and zeros elsewhere, this might not fit. However, the test input has a 1 in column 2 of row 1, which sets column 2's rows 0-1 to 2, hence row 0, column 2 becomes 2.\n\nBut according to this processing, row 0 is [2,0,2], row 1 is [2,0,0], row 2 is [0,0,0]. \n\nBut looking at similar examples like Example 6, which has input:\n\n[0,1,0]\n[1,1,0]\n[0,0,0]\n\nOutput:\n[2,2,2]\n[0,0,0]\n[0,0,0]\n\nIn this case, the processing would set row 0 to all 2s due to the 1s in row 0 and row 1. So perhaps the overlapping regions from multiple 1s lead to more 2s.\n\nBut according to this, the test input's row 0 would have [2,0,2], which doesn't match any training example. \n\nGiven the time constraints, I'll proceed with the answer that follows the pattern of the highest row and column influences, leading to the first row being filled with 2s and others as per the rules.\n\nBut based on Example 8's similar structure, the output for the test input might be:\n\n[2,2,2]\n[0,2,0]\n[0,0,0]\n\nBecause the 1 in (1,2) would affect column 2 up to row 1, and row 1 up to column 2, but after setting the original 1s to 0.\n\nAlternatively, considering the highest row and column indices of the 1s, the test input's highest row is 2 (but the 1 is in row 2, column 0), and highest column is 2 (in row 1, column 2). So all cells (i,j) where i <=2 and j <=2 would be 2. But original 1s are set to 0. But this would fill the entire grid with 2s except the original 1s. But that's not the case in the examples.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and the need to provide an answer, I'll make an educated guess that the output for the test input is:\n\n[2,2,2]\n[0,2,0]\n[0,0,0]\n\nThis is similar to Example 8's output, where having multiple 1s in the middle rows leads to a 2 in the middle of the second row."
