        "cot_1": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. So, looking at the training examples, each input is a 3x3 grid of numbers, and the output is another 3x3 grid. Let me see how they're transforming the input to get the output.\n\nStarting with Example 0:\nInput:\n[1, 1, 1]\n[0, 0, 0]\n[0, 0, 0]\n\nOutput:\n[0, 0, 0]\n[1, 1, 1]\n[0, 0, 0]\n\nHmm, here the top row (all 1s) moved down to the middle row, and the middle and bottom rows moved up. So maybe it's shifting each row down by one, and the bottom row wraps around to the top? But wait, in Example 0, the bottom rows were all zeros. Let me check Example 1.\n\nExample 1:\nInput:\n[0, 0, 0]\n[1, 1, 1]\n[0, 0, 0]\n\nOutput:\n[0, 0, 0]\n[0, 0, 0]\n[1, 1, 1]\n\nHere, the middle row (1s) moved down to the bottom, and the top and middle rows shifted up. So again, shifting down by one. The bottom row in the input was all zeros, so when shifted down, the middle row's 1s go to the bottom. So maybe the pattern is that each row shifts down, and the bottom row wraps to the top? But in Example 0, the bottom rows were zeros, so the top row moved to the middle. Let's check Example 2.\n\nExample 2:\nInput:\n[0, 1, 0]\n[1, 1, 0]\n[0, 0, 0]\n\nOutput:\n[0, 0, 0]\n[0, 1, 0]\n[1, 1, 0]\n\nSo input's top row is [0,1,0], middle [1,1,0], bottom [0,0,0]. The output shifts the top row down to the middle? Wait, the output's middle row is [0,1,0], which is the input's top row. The output's bottom row is [1,1,0], which is the input's middle row. The top output row is all zeros. So it looks like each row is shifted down by one, and the bottom row is moved to the top? Or maybe the entire grid is rotated downward, pushing the bottom row out and moving everything else down. Wait, in Example 0, the input's first row moves to the second, the second to third, and the third wraps to the first. But in Example 0, the third row (all zeros) would wrap to the first, making the first row all zeros. But in the output, the first row is zeros, the second is the original first row, and the third is zeros. Wait, that doesn't fit a simple rotation. Let me re-examine.\n\nWait, in Example 0, the input is:\nRow 0: [1,1,1]\nRow 1: [0,0,0]\nRow 2: [0,0,0]\n\nOutput:\nRow 0: [0,0,0]\nRow 1: [1,1,1]\nRow 2: [0,0,0]\n\nSo row 0 moved to row 1, row 1 moved to row 2, and row 2 moved to row 0. Because if you rotate down, each row shifts down and the last row goes to the top. But in Example 0, the output row 0 is the original row 2 (which was [0,0,0]), row 1 is original row 0, and row 2 is original row 1. So yes, that's a downward rotation. Let me check this for all examples.\n\nExample 1:\nInput rows 0,1,2 are [0,0,0], [1,1,1], [0,0,0]. Output rows are [0,0,0], [0,0,0], [1,1,1]. So if rotated down, row 2 (input's [0,0,0]) becomes row 0, row 0 becomes row 1, and row 1 becomes row 2. But input's row 1 is [1,1,1], so output row 2 is [1,1,1]. That matches. So this rotation seems to fit.\n\nExample 2:\nInput rows:\n0: [0,1,0]\n1: [1,1,0]\n2: [0,0,0]\n\nRotated down would be:\nRow 0 becomes input row 2 ([0,0,0])\nRow 1 becomes input row 0 ([0,1,0])\nRow 2 becomes input row 1 ([1,1,0])\n\nWhich matches the output. So output is:\n[0,0,0]\n[0,1,0]\n[1,1,0]\n\nYes. So the pattern is that each row is shifted down by one, with the bottom row wrapping around to the top. So the transformation is a cyclic shift downward.\n\nTesting this with Example 3:\n\nInput:\n[0,2,2]\n[0,0,2]\n[0,0,0]\n\nAfter shifting down:\nRow 0 becomes input row 2 [0,0,0]\nRow 1 becomes input row 0 [0,2,2]\nRow 2 becomes input row 1 [0,0,2]\n\nSo output should be:\n\n[0,0,0]\n[0,2,2]\n[0,0,2]\n\nWhich matches the given output. So the pattern is confirmed.\n\nNow, the test input is:\n\n[2, 0, 0]\n[2, 0, 0]\n[0, 0, 0]\n\nApplying the same transformation: each row shifts down by one, with the bottom row (third row) moving to the top.\n\nOriginal rows:\n\nRow 0: [2,0,0]\nRow 1: [2,0,0]\nRow 2: [0,0,0]\n\nAfter shifting down, the new rows are:\n\nNew row 0: Original row 2 \u2192 [0,0,0]\nNew row 1: Original row 0 \u2192 [2,0,0]\nNew row 2: Original row 1 \u2192 [2,0,0]\n\nSo the output should be:\n\n[0,0,0]\n[2,0,0]\n[2,0,0]\n\nLet me check if this makes sense. Yes, each row is shifted down, and the last row wraps to the top. So the test input's output should have the original third row as the first row, then original first, then original second.",

        "cot_2": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. So, looking at the training examples, the input is a 3x3 grid, and the output is another 3x3 grid. Let's see each example step by step.\n\nIn Example 0, the input has the first row all 1s and the rest 0s. The output shifts that row of 1s down to the second row. So maybe it's moving the non-zero row down by one?\n\nExample 1's input is the output from Example 0. Then the output shifts it down again, so the 1s move to the third row. But wait, in the output, the first two rows are zeros. So each time, the non-zero row is moving down one row. But what happens if there's more than one non-zero row?\n\nLooking at Example 2, the input is:\n[0,1,0]\n[1,1,0]\n[0,0,0]\nThe output shifts those non-zero elements down. The first row [0,1,0] becomes the second row in the output, and the second row [1,1,0] becomes the third row. Wait, but the output shows:\n[0,0,0]\n[0,1,0]\n[1,1,0]\nSo the original first row (second row in input) moves down to the third row, and the original top row (first row) moves down to the second. Wait, maybe each row is shifted down by one, and the bottom row wraps around? But in Example 0, the bottom row was all zeros. Hmm.\n\nWait in Example 0 input:\nRow 0: [1,1,1]\nRow 1: [0,0,0]\nRow 2: [0,0,0]\nOutput is:\nRow 0: [0,0,0]\nRow 1: [1,1,1]\nRow 2: [0,0,0]\nSo the first row moved down one. Similarly, in Example 1, the 1s are in row 1, then move to row 2. So each time, the non-zero rows shift down by one, and if they're at the bottom, maybe they disappear? Wait, but in Example 3:\n\nInput:\n[0,2,2]\n[0,0,2]\n[0,0,0]\nOutput:\n[0,0,0]\n[0,2,2]\n[0,0,2]\nSo the first row [0,2,2] moves down to row 1, and the second row [0,0,2] moves down to row 2. So it's like shifting all the rows down by one, and the bottom row (row 2) is pushed out, replaced by the row above it. The top row becomes zeros.\n\nSo the pattern is that each row is shifted down by one position. The original row 0 moves to row 1, row 1 to row 2, and row 2 is replaced by zeros? Or perhaps, every row is shifted down, and the original bottom row is lost, with the top row filled with zeros. Wait, in Example 0, the original rows are [1s], [0s], [0s]. After shifting down, the first row becomes 0s, the second row becomes the original first, and the third becomes the original second (which is 0s). So yes, it's a downward shift where each row moves down, the bottom row is discarded, and the top is filled with 0s. Wait, but in Example 2:\n\nOriginal input rows:\n0: [0,1,0]\n1: [1,1,0]\n2: [0,0,0]\nAfter shifting, output rows:\n0: [0,0,0]\n1: [0,1,0]\n2: [1,1,0]\nSo row 0 becomes row 1, row 1 becomes row 2, and row 2 (original) is replaced by zeros. Wait, no, original row 2 was zeros. So when shifting down, the new row 0 is zeros, row 1 is original row 0, row 2 is original row 1. So the process is: shift all rows down by one, and the new top row (row 0) is filled with zeros.\n\nSo the general rule is: each row in the input is moved down by one position. The row that was at the bottom (row 2) is removed. The new top row (row 0) becomes zeros. Wait, but in Example 3:\n\nInput rows:\n0: [0,2,2]\n1: [0,0,2]\n2: [0,0,0]\nOutput:\n0: [0,0,0]\n1: [0,2,2]\n2: [0,0,2]\nSo original row 0 moves to row 1, original row 1 moves to row 2. Original row 2 (all zeros) is moved down, but since there's nothing below, it's replaced by the shifted rows. The top row becomes zeros. So the transformation is shifting each row down by one, and the first row is filled with zeros. So any existing rows move down, and the top row is zeroed.\n\nTesting this with the test input:\n\nTest input is:\n[2,0,0] (row 0)\n[2,0,0] (row 1)\n[0,0,0] (row 2)\n\nApplying the pattern: shift each row down. So row 0 becomes row 1, row 1 becomes row 2, row 2 is replaced by zeros. Wait, but original row 2 is zeros. So the new rows would be:\n\nRow 0: [0,0,0] (new top row)\nRow 1: [2,0,0] (original row 0)\nRow 2: [2,0,0] (original row 1)\n\nWait, but according to the previous examples, when you shift down, row 0's content moves to row 1, row 1's to row 2, and row 2 is replaced by zeros. Wait, no, in the examples, when you shift down, the original row 0 becomes row 1, row 1 becomes row 2, and row 2 is discarded (or becomes the new row 2?), and the top row becomes zeros.\n\nWait, in Example 0:\n\nOriginal:\n\nRow0: 1s \u2192 becomes row1.\n\nRow1: 0s \u2192 becomes row2.\n\nRow2: 0s \u2192 is gone, and new row0 is 0s.\n\nSo the output is:\n\nRow0: 0s\n\nRow1: original row0\n\nRow2: original row1.\n\nWait, that can't be. Because in Example 0's output, row1 is 1s (original row0), row2 is 0s (original row1). So shifting each row down by one, with the top being filled with 0s.\n\nSo the rule is:\n\nFor each row in the input grid:\n\n- The row at position i (0-based) is moved to position i+1.\n\n- The new row0 is filled with 0s.\n\n- The original row2 (since there's no row3) is dropped, so the new row2 is the original row1.\n\nWait, no, that's not possible. Let's see:\n\nOriginal rows:\n\nrow0 \u2192 becomes row1.\n\nrow1 \u2192 becomes row2.\n\nrow2 \u2192 is removed.\n\nBut the output grid has three rows, so the new row0 is 0s, new row1 is original row0, new row2 is original row1. So in effect, all rows are shifted down by one, and the top row becomes 0s.\n\nSo for the test input:\n\nOriginal rows:\n\n0: [2,0,0]\n\n1: [2,0,0]\n\n2: [0,0,0]\n\nApplying the shift:\n\nnew row0: [0,0,0]\n\nnew row1: original row0 \u2192 [2,0,0]\n\nnew row2: original row1 \u2192 [2,0,0]\n\nSo the output should be:\n\n[0,0,0]\n\n[2,0,0]\n\n[2,0,0]\n\nWait, but let me check the examples again. For Example 3:\n\nInput rows:\n\n0: [0,2,2]\n\n1: [0,0,2]\n\n2: [0,0,0]\n\nOutput:\n\n0: [0,0,0]\n\n1: [0,2,2] (original row0)\n\n2: [0,0,2] (original row1)\n\nYes, that's how it works. So the test input's output would be:\n\n[0,0,0]\n\n[2,0,0]\n\n[2,0,0]\n\nBut let's see if that's correct. Let me see another example.\n\nExample 2's input:\n\nInput rows:\n\n0: [0,1,0]\n\n1: [1,1,0]\n\n2: [0,0,0]\n\nOutput:\n\n0: [0,0,0]\n\n1: [0,1,0] (original row0)\n\n2: [1,1,0] (original row1)\n\nYes, so the test case should follow the same pattern. So the answer should be:\n\n[0,0,0]\n\n[2,0,0]\n\n[2,0,0]\n\nBut let me check again. The test input is:\n\nOriginal:\n\nRow0: [2,0,0]\n\nRow1: [2,0,0]\n\nRow2: [0,0,0]\n\nAfter shifting, the output rows are:\n\nRow0: 0s.\n\nRow1: original row0 \u2192 [2,0,0]\n\nRow2: original row1 \u2192 [2,0,0]\n\nSo the output would be:\n\n[0,0,0]\n\n[2,0,0]\n\n[2,0,0]\n\nYes. So that's the correct answer."

        "cot_1": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. So, looking at the training examples, I need to see how each input is transformed into the output. Let's start with Example 0.\n\nIn Example 0, the input is three rows:\n[1,1,1]\n[0,0,0]\n[0,0,0]\n\nAnd the output is:\n[0,0,0]\n[1,1,1]\n[0,0,0]\n\nSo it looks like the middle row (second row) moved down to the third row? Wait no. Wait, the original first row (all 1s) moved to the second row in the output, and the other rows shifted up. Wait, maybe the rows are shifting down, but the first row's 1s are moving to the second row. But then in the output, the second row is now the first row? Or maybe the rows are rotating?\n\nWait let's check Example 1. The input is:\n[0,0,0]\n[1,1,1]\n[0,0,0]\n\nThe output is:\n[0,0,0]\n[0,0,0]\n[1,1,1]\n\nSo here, the second row with 1s moved down to the third row. So maybe each non-zero row is shifting down by one, and the bottom row wraps around to the top? But in Example 0, the first row moves to the second. Then in Example 1, the second row moves to the third. So maybe the non-zero rows are moving down by one, and if they can't (like being in the bottom row), they wrap around. Wait, but in Example 0, the output's first row is all zeros. Wait, maybe it's not wrapping around. Let me think again.\n\nWait, in Example 0, the input has the first row as [1,1,1], and the next two as zeros. The output shifts that first row down to the second position. So the non-zero row moves down by one. Similarly, in Example 1, the non-zero row (second row) moves down to the third. So each non-zero row is shifted down by one. But what if there's a non-zero row in the bottom? Then perhaps it wraps around to the top. But looking at the examples given, maybe that's not the case here. Wait, maybe it's not just the non-zero rows, but all rows are shifting down, but the bottom row is filled with zeros? Or perhaps there's another pattern.\n\nLooking at Example 2. Input:\n[0,1,0]\n[1,1,0]\n[0,0,0]\n\nOutput:\n[0,0,0]\n[0,1,0]\n[1,1,0]\n\nHere, the first row [0,1,0] moves down to the second row, and the second row [1,1,0] moves down to the third. The third row (all zeros) becomes the first row? No, the output's first row is all zeros. So it's like each row is shifted down by one, and the top row becomes all zeros. Wait, but in Example 0, the original first row moves to the second, and the original second and third (zeros) become first and second? No. Wait, let me list the input and output rows for Example 0:\n\nInput rows:\nRow 0: [1,1,1]\nRow 1: [0,0,0]\nRow 2: [0,0,0]\n\nOutput rows:\nRow 0: [0,0,0]\nRow 1: [1,1,1]\nRow 2: [0,0,0]\n\nSo the first row (non-zero) moves down one to row 1. The other rows are shifted up? Or maybe every row is shifted down, but the top row is filled with zeros. Wait, if you shift all rows down by one, then row 0 would take row 2's original values. But in Example 0, original row 0 is [1,1,1], and after shifting down, row 1 becomes [1,1,1], and row 0 becomes whatever was row 2. But row 2 was zeros, so row 0 becomes zeros, and row 1 becomes the original row 0. So that's a shift down of all rows, with the bottom row wrapping to the top. But in Example 0, that's not happening. Wait, if you shift down each row by one, then row 0 would become what row 2 was, row 1 becomes row 0, row 2 becomes row 1. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused here. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each non-zero row is shifted down by one, and if that's not possible (like being the last row), it wraps around. But in Example 0, the non-zero row is row 0, which shifts down to row 1. In Example 1, the non-zero row is row 1, shifts down to row 2. In Example 2, there are two non-zero rows. Let's look:\n\nExample 2 input:\nRow 0: [0,1,0]\nRow 1: [1,1,0]\nRow 2: [0,0,0]\n\nOutput:\nRow 0: [0,0,0]\nRow 1: [0,1,0]\nRow 2: [1,1,0]\n\nSo both non-zero rows (0 and 1) shifted down by one. So row 0 becomes row 1, row 1 becomes row 2, and row 2 (originally zero) becomes row 0. But row 0 in the output is zero. Wait, but row 2 was zero. So shifting all rows down by one would mean that each row moves down, and the last row becomes the first. But in Example 0, that would make row 0's original content move to row 1, but row 0 would take row 2's original content (zeros). Similarly, in Example 1, the input's row 1 (non-zero) moves to row 2, and row 0 takes row 2's original zeros, resulting in the output where row 2 is the non-zero.\n\nSo maybe the pattern is a downward shift of all rows. Each row is moved down by one, and the bottom row wraps around to the top. But in the examples, after shifting, the top row becomes zero. Wait, let's check:\n\nIn Example 0: shifting down all rows. Original rows 0,1,2. After shifting down, row 0 becomes row 2's original (zeros), row 1 becomes row 0's original ([1,1,1]), row 2 becomes row 1's original (zeros). So output is:\n\n[0,0,0]\n\n[1,1,1]\n\n[0,0,0]\n\nWhich matches Example 0's output.\n\nSimilarly, Example 1's input is:\n\nRow0: 0s\n\nRow1: 1s\n\nRow2: 0s\n\nShifting down: row0 becomes row2 (0s), row1 becomes row0 (0s), row2 becomes row1 (1s). Wait, no. Wait, if shifting down, each row moves down, and the bottom row wraps to the top. So in a standard circular shift down, row0 becomes what was row2, row1 becomes what was row0, row2 becomes what was row1. Wait, no. Wait, let's clarify: in a standard downward shift, each row is moved down by one, and the last row wraps around to the first position. So:\n\nOriginal rows:\n\n0: A\n\n1: B\n\n2: C\n\nAfter shifting down:\n\n0: C\n\n1: A\n\n2: B\n\nBut that's a circular shift. But looking at the examples, this isn't the case. Let's check Example 1. If we shift down the rows circularly:\n\nInput rows:\n\n0: [0,0,0]\n\n1: [1,1,1]\n\n2: [0,0,0]\n\nAfter shift down:\n\n0 would be row2's original (0s)\n\n1 would be row0's original (0s)\n\n2 would be row1's original (1s)\n\nBut the output of Example 1 is:\n\n[0,0,0]\n\n[0,0,0]\n\n[1,1,1]\n\nWhich would be rows 0: row0 original (0s?), no. Wait, perhaps the shift isn't circular. Maybe instead, all rows are shifted down by one, and the new top row is filled with zeros. Let's see:\n\nIn Example 0, shifting down each row by one, so the first row moves to second, second to third, third... but the third row would have to come from somewhere. But if we just shift down and add a zero row at the top, then:\n\nOriginal rows:\n\n0: [1,1,1]\n\n1: [0,0,0]\n\n2: [0,0,0]\n\nShift down, so new row0 is zero, row1 is original row0, row2 is original row1.\n\nThat matches Example 0's output.\n\nSimilarly, Example 1's input is:\n\nRow0: 0s\n\nRow1: 1s\n\nRow2: 0s\n\nShifting down, new row0 is 0s (since we add a new zero row?), no. Wait, maybe the shifting is such that each existing row moves down one, and the new top row (row0) is filled with zeros. But how would that work with the existing rows? Let me see:\n\nIf you shift each row down by one, the original row0 becomes row1, original row1 becomes row2, and original row2 is discarded (or shifted out), and a new row of zeros is added at the top. But that doesn't fit the examples. Because in Example 0, original row2 is zeros, so after shifting down, row2 would be the original row1 (zeros), but the new row0 would be zeros. But the output has row1 as [1,1,1], which was original row0. So that's possible. So perhaps the transformation is: each row is shifted down by one, with the top row becoming zeros. Wait, but in that case, the bottom row would be lost. Let me test this:\n\nTake Example 0's input. Shift down each row:\n\nOriginal rows:\n\n0: [1,1,1]\n\n1: [0,0,0]\n\n2: [0,0,0]\n\nShift down, so row0 becomes row1's original (0s), row1 becomes row2's original (0s), row2 becomes ... what? There's no row3. So maybe the last row is dropped, and a new row of zeros is added at the top. That doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the entire grid is shifted down, with the bottom row being removed and a new zero row added at the top. But in that case, for Example 0, the output would have the original rows 0 and 1 shifted down, but row2 is removed, and a new zero row added. But that would mean:\n\nOriginal rows:\n\n[1,1,1] (row0)\n\n[0,0,0] (row1)\n\n[0,0,0] (row2)\n\nShift down, remove row2, add a new zero row at the top. So new rows would be:\n\n[0,0,0] (new row0)\n\n[1,1,1] (original row0)\n\n[0,0,0] (original row1)\n\nWhich matches the output of Example 0. So in this case, the shifting is like moving all rows down by one, discarding the last row (row2), and adding a new zero row at the top. Wait, but in Example 1, the original rows are:\n\nRow0: 0s\n\nRow1: 1s\n\nRow2: 0s\n\nAfter shifting, we would remove row2 (0s), add a new zero row at the top. So new rows:\n\n[0,0,0] (new row0)\n\n[0,0,0] (original row0)\n\n[1,1,1] (original row1)\n\nWhich matches Example 1's output.\n\nSimilarly, in Example 2:\n\nInput rows:\n\nRow0: [0,1,0]\n\nRow1: [1,1,0]\n\nRow2: [0,0,0]\n\nShift down: discard row2, add new zero row at top. So new rows:\n\n[0,0,0] (new row0)\n\n[0,1,0] (original row0)\n\n[1,1,0] (original row1)\n\nWhich matches the output of Example 2.\n\nThen Example 3:\n\nInput:\n\nRow0: [0,2,2]\n\nRow1: [0,0,2]\n\nRow2: [0,0,0]\n\nShift down: discard row2, add new zero row. So new rows:\n\n[0,0,0] (new row0)\n\n[0,2,2] (original row0)\n\n[0,0,2] (original row1)\n\nWhich matches Example 3's output.\n\nSo the pattern is: shift all rows down by one, discard the bottom row, and add a new row of zeros at the top. Wait, but in the examples, the original bottom row (row2) is being discarded, and the new top row is zeros. Then the previous rows are shifted down. So each original row moves down by one, the top row is new zeros, and the bottom row is lost.\n\nBut how does that work in the case where the original row2 is not all zeros? For example, if the original rows are:\n\nRow0: A\n\nRow1: B\n\nRow2: C\n\nThen after the shift, it becomes:\n\nRow0: 0s\n\nRow1: A\n\nRow2: B\n\nSo row C is discarded. So regardless of what's in row2, it's removed, and the new row is added at the top. So the transformation is to shift all existing rows down by one, discard the last row (row2), and add a new row of zeros at the top.\n\nBut in the examples given, all the original row2's are zeros except perhaps in some cases. Let's check:\n\nIn Example 0, original row2 is zeros, so after shifting, row2 becomes original row1 (also zeros). So the output row2 is zeros.\n\nIn Example 3's input, row2 is zeros, so shifting down, row2 becomes row1's original (0,0,2).\n\nWait, maybe the transformation is that each row is shifted down by one, and the top row is filled with zeros. But how exactly?\n\nAlternative approach: For each row i in the input, the output's row i+1 is equal to input's row i, except for the last row of the output, which is the input's row2 (but in the examples, this is not the case). Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, the output is the input shifted down by one row, with the top row being zeros, and the bottom row being the original row1. Wait, perhaps:\n\nOutput row0 is all zeros.\n\nOutput row1 is input row0.\n\nOutput row2 is input row1.\n\nYes, this seems to fit all examples.\n\nLet's test this:\n\nExample 0 input:\n\nRow0: [1,1,1]\n\nRow1: [0,0,0]\n\nRow2: [0,0,0]\n\nOutput:\n\nRow0: 0s\n\nRow1: [1,1,1] (input row0)\n\nRow2: [0,0,0] (input row1)\n\nWhich matches Example 0's output.\n\nExample 1 input:\n\nRow0: 0s\n\nRow1: 1s\n\nRow2: 0s\n\nOutput:\n\nRow0: 0s\n\nRow1: 0s (input row0)\n\nRow2: 1s (input row1)\n\nWhich matches Example 1's output.\n\nExample 2 input:\n\nRow0: [0,1,0]\n\nRow1: [1,1,0]\n\nRow2: 0s\n\nOutput:\n\nRow0: 0s\n\nRow1: [0,1,0] (input row0)\n\nRow2: [1,1,0] (input row1)\n\nWhich matches Example 2's output.\n\nExample 3 input:\n\nRow0: [0,2,2]\n\nRow1: [0,0,2]\n\nRow2: 0s\n\nOutput:\n\nRow0: 0s\n\nRow1: [0,2,2] (input row0)\n\nRow2: [0,0,2] (input row1)\n\nWhich matches Example3's output.\n\nSo the pattern is: Shift all rows down by one, inserting a new row of zeros at the top. So output row0 is zeros. Output row1 is input row0. Output row2 is input row1. The original input row2 is not part of the output (since we only have three rows, shifting down would push the original row1 to row2, and original row2 is lost).\n\nYes, this seems to fit all examples. So for any input, the output is constructed by:\n\n- The first row is all zeros.\n\n- The second row is the first row of the input.\n\n- The third row is the second row of the input.\n\nThe original third row of the input is discarded.\n\nTherefore, applying this pattern to the test input:\n\nTest input:\n\nRow0: [0,0,0]\n\nRow1: [0,1,0]\n\nRow2: [0,0,0]\n\nAccording to the pattern:\n\nOutput row0: [0,0,0]\n\nOutput row1: input row0 \u2192 [0,0,0]\n\nOutput row2: input row1 \u2192 [0,1,0]\n\nSo the output should be:\n\n[0,0,0]\n\n[0,0,0]\n\n[0,1,0]\n\nBut wait, let me check again. Wait, in the test input, the original row2 is [0,0,0]. According to the pattern, the output row2 is input row1. So yes, the output would be:\n\nRow0: 0s\n\nRow1: original row0 (0s)\n\nRow2: original row1 ([0,1,0])\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\nOUTPUT:\n\n[0,0,0]\n\n[0,0,0]\n\n[0,1,0]\n\nYes, that seems correct.",

        "cot_2": "Okay, let's see. I need to figure out the pattern here. The training examples show some kind of transformation between the input and output grids. Let's look at each example one by one.\n\nStarting with Example 0:\nInput is:\n[1,1,1]\n[0,0,0]\n[0,0,0]\n\nOutput is:\n[0,0,0]\n[1,1,1]\n[0,0,0]\n\nSo the top row of 1s moved down to the middle row. It looks like it's shifting down by one row. Let's check Example 1 to confirm.\n\nExample 1:\nInput:\n[0,0,0]\n[1,1,1]\n[0,0,0]\n\nOutput:\n[0,0,0]\n[0,0,0]\n[1,1,1]\n\nYes, the middle row shifted down to the bottom. So the pattern here is shifting each non-zero row down by one, and the bottom row wraps around? Wait, in Example 0, the top row shifted to the middle, but in Example 1, the middle shifts to the bottom. Wait, maybe not wrapping. Let's see.\n\nWait, in Example 0, the input has 1s in the first row. The output has them in the second. Example 1 input has 1s in the second row, output in the third. So each non-zero row moves down by one. But what happens when there's a non-zero row in the bottom? Like if the input had the bottom row as 1s, where would they go? Maybe they disappear, or perhaps they wrap around. But the examples don't cover that.\n\nNow Example 2:\nInput:\n[0,1,0]\n[1,1,0]\n[0,0,0]\n\nOutput:\n[0,0,0]\n[0,1,0]\n[1,1,0]\n\nSo first row has [0,1,0], which shifts down to the second row? Wait, original second row was [1,1,0], which shifts down to third. So the first row's elements (the 1) moves down to the second row, and the second row's elements move down to the third row. So each non-zero element is shifting down one row, but perhaps each entire row is shifted down as a block. So if a row has any non-zero elements, the entire row shifts down. But what if there are multiple non-zero rows?\n\nWait in Example 0, the input has only the first row non-zero, which shifts down. In Example 1, only the middle row shifts down. In Example 2, the first and second rows are non-zero. Let's see: input rows 0 and 1 have non-zero elements. The output rows 1 and 2. So each row is shifted down by one. But how about overlapping? Like if a row is shifted down, and the next row is also being shifted. So maybe the rows are all shifted down by one, but the rows that were non-zero are moved down, pushing the ones below further? Or is it that each non-zero row individually is shifted down, and if the row below is empty, it's replaced by the shifted one.\n\nWait, in Example 2's input:\n\nRow 0: [0,1,0] (has non-zero elements)\nRow 1: [1,1,0] (also non-zero)\nRow 2: all zeros.\n\nOutput is:\nRow 0: all zeros\nRow 1: [0,1,0] (original row 0)\nRow 2: [1,1,0] (original row 1)\n\nSo both non-zero rows shifted down by one. So the pattern is that every non-zero row is shifted down by one row, and the rows below are replaced by them. So the entire structure shifts down. If the bottom row is non-zero, maybe it disappears or wraps around, but the examples don't show that. Let's check Example 3.\n\nExample 3:\nInput:\n[0,2,2]\n[0,0,2]\n[0,0,0]\n\nOutput:\n[0,0,0]\n[0,2,2]\n[0,0,2]\n\nOriginal rows 0 and 1 are non-zero. So they shift down to rows 1 and 2. So input row 0 becomes output row 1, input row 1 becomes output row 2. So yes, each non-zero row shifts down by one. The rows that were shifted down replace the rows below them. So zeros are filled in the top if there's no row above to shift into it. So the top row becomes zeros, then each row's content is moved down if they were non-zero.\n\nWait, but in Example 2, the original row 0 was [0,1,0], which is non-zero (since there's a 1), so it shifts down to row 1. Original row 1 [1,1,0] shifts to row 2. So the output is the shifted rows. Rows that were non-zero move down by one. So the process is: for each row in the input, starting from the top, if the row has any non-zero elements, that row is moved down by one position. But if there are multiple consecutive non-zero rows, they all shift down.\n\nSo in Example 0: the first row (non-zero) shifts to the second, and the other rows (all zeros) remain. But in Example 3, the first and second rows shift down, so row 0 moves to 1, row 1 moves to 2.\n\nBut how does this work when there's a row that's being shifted into? For example, if two rows are non-zero and adjacent. Like in Example 2, the input has rows 0 and 1 non-zero. So row 0 shifts to 1, row 1 shifts to 2. So the original row 1's data ends up in row 2. So even if there's a row below that's non-zero, it's shifted as well. So the shifting applies to all non-zero rows, each moving down by one. If shifting a row would push it into another non-zero row that is also being shifted, then perhaps they stack. But in the examples, that doesn't happen. Let's verify with Example 2's input and output.\n\nInput Example 2:\nRow0: 0,1,0 \u2192 non-zero \u2192 shifts to row1.\nRow1:1,1,0 \u2192 non-zero \u2192 shifts to row2.\nRow2: 0,0,0 \u2192 remains.\n\nSo the output rows are:\nRow0: 0,0,0 (since nothing shifts into it)\nRow1: row0's shifted data \u2192 0,1,0\nRow2: row1's shifted data \u21921,1,0\n\nWhich matches the output. So yes, the pattern is that each non-zero row in the input is shifted down by one row in the output. Any non-zero rows move down, and the top becomes zeros. But what if there are multiple rows? Let's see another hypothetical example. Suppose input is:\n\nRow0: [1,1]\nRow1: [1,1]\nRow2: [0,0]\n\nThen the output would be:\n\nRow0: [0,0]\nRow1: [1,1] (from original row0)\nRow2: [1,1] (from original row1)\n\nSo both rows shifted down by one.\n\nNow, applying this to the test input.\n\nTest Input:\n[0,0,0]\n[0,1,0]\n[0,0,0]\n\nLooking at each row:\n\nRow0: all zeros \u2192 stays as is.\nRow1: has a 1 \u2192 non-zero \u2192 shifts down to row2.\nRow2: all zeros \u2192 remains (unless row1 shifts into it).\n\nSo according to the pattern, the output should be:\n\nRow0: all zeros (since nothing shifts into it)\nRow1: becomes zeros (since original row1 shifts down)\nRow2: becomes [0,1,0]\n\nSo the output would be:\n\n[0,0,0]\n[0,0,0]\n[0,1,0]\n\nWait, but looking at the training examples, when a row is non-zero, it shifts down. Let's check Example 1. In Example 1, input has row1 as non-zero. Output has row2 as non-zero. So the shifting is for each non-zero row to move down by one. So in the test input, the middle row (row1) has a 1. So it shifts down to row2. Therefore, the output should be:\n\nOriginal row0: [0,0,0] \u2192 remains as row0 (if not shifted from above)\nOriginal row1: [0,1,0] \u2192 shifts to row2.\nOriginal row2: [0,0,0] \u2192 becomes whatever was shifted into it.\n\nSo output rows:\n\nRow0: [0,0,0]\nRow1: [0,0,0] (since original row0 was zeros and didn't shift down)\nRow2: [0,1,0]\n\nWhich would be:\n\n[0,0,0]\n[0,0,0]\n[0,1,0]\n\nBut let me check if that's the case. Let me see Example 2 again. In Example 2's input, the first row (row0) was [0,1,0], which is non-zero (since there's a 1). So it shifts down to row1. The original row1 was [1,1,0], which shifts down to row2. So in the output, row1 is the shifted row0, and row2 is shifted row1. So yes, each non-zero row shifts down, even if adjacent.\n\nSo for the test case, since only row1 is non-zero, it shifts to row2, and the rest are zeros. Therefore, the output should be:\n\n[0,0,0]\n[0,0,0]\n[0,1,0]\n\nBut let me check if there's any other possible pattern. For instance, maybe the non-zero elements themselves are moving down, not the entire rows. Let's think. For example, in Example 2:\n\nInput:\nRow0: [0,1,0]\nRow1: [1,1,0]\nRow2: zeros.\n\nOutput:\nRow0: zeros\nRow1: [0,1,0]\nRow2: [1,1,0]\n\nSo each non-zero element is moving down by one row, but keeping their columns. But in that case, individual elements are moving. But in the first example, all the 1s in row0 move to row1. So the entire row moves down. So perhaps the pattern is that each non-zero row (any element non-zero in the row) is shifted down as a whole. So the entire row is moved down by one, pushing any existing rows below down as well. Wait, but in Example 2, row0 moves to row1, and row1 moves to row2. So rows are shifted in order. So the processing is top to bottom. So first, row0 is moved down, then row1 is moved down. So in Example 2, after moving row0 down to row1, then row1 (original) is moved down to row2. So the output is the shifted versions.\n\nBut how does this affect if there's a non-zero row below a shifted one? For example, if row0 is non-zero and row1 is non-zero. Shifting row0 down to row1, then row1 (original) shifts to row2. So yes, that's what's happening.\n\nSo applying this to the test input:\n\nOriginal row0: all zeros \u2192 no shift.\nRow1: has a 1 \u2192 shift to row2.\nRow2: zeros.\n\nSo row1's content moves to row2. So the output becomes:\n\nRow0: [0,0,0]\nRow1: [0,0,0] (since nothing is shifted into it, because row0 was zeros)\nRow2: [0,1,0] (original row1's content)\n\nWhich matches the pattern. So the answer should be:\n\n[0,0,0]\n[0,0,0]\n[0,1,0]"
