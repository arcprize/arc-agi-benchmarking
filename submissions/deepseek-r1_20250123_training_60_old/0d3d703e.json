        "cot_1": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. So, looking at the training examples, each input is a list of three numbers repeated three times. The output is also a list of three numbers repeated three times. So the main thing is to find out how each input triplet transforms into the output triplet.\n\nLet's take the first example:\n\nInput: [3, 1, 2]\nOutput: [4, 5, 6]\n\nHmm, maybe adding something? Let's check. 3+1=4, 1+4=5, 2+4=6. Wait, that adds 1, then 4, then 4? That doesn't seem consistent. Alternatively, maybe each number is being transformed in a different way.\n\nLooking at example 1:\n\nInput: [2,3,8] \u2192 Output: [6,4,9]\n\n2 \u2192 6: difference is +4. 3 \u21924: +1. 8\u21929: +1. Not sure. Or maybe multiply? 2*3=6, 3*1.333=4 (but that's not a whole number). Hmm. Maybe something else.\n\nWait, let's check another example. Example 2:\n\nInput [5,8,6] \u2192 Output [1,9,2]\n\n5\u21921. Maybe 5-4=1. 8\u21929: +1. 6\u21922: 6-4=2. So here, maybe different operations per element. For 5: subtract 4, 8 add 1, 6 subtract 4? Not sure. Let's check example 3.\n\nInput [9,4,2] \u2192 Output [8,3,6]\n\n9\u21928: subtract 1. 4\u21923: subtract 1. 2\u21926: add 4. That's inconsistent. So maybe not straightforward arithmetic operations.\n\nAnother approach: sum of the digits. Let's see:\n\nIn example 0, input sum is 3+1+2=6. Output sum is 4+5+6=15. Not a direct relation. Maybe sum of all elements in input multiplied by something. 6 \u219215, which is 6*2.5. Not sure.\n\nWait, maybe the output numbers are each digits that add up to a certain total. Alternatively, maybe it's related to the position of the numbers. Let's look for another pattern.\n\nAnother idea: maybe each digit is transformed by a specific rule. Let's list each input and output for all examples.\n\nExample 0:\n3 \u21924\n1 \u21925\n2 \u21926\n\nExample1:\n2\u21926\n3\u21924\n8\u21929\n\nExample2:\n5\u21921\n8\u21929\n6\u21922\n\nExample3:\n9\u21928\n4\u21923\n2\u21926\n\nLooking for possible patterns for each position.\n\nLooking at the first elements:\n\n3\u21924: +1\n2\u21926: +4\n5\u21921: -4\n9\u21928: -1\n\nNot obvious. Second elements:\n\n1\u21925: +4\n3\u21924: +1\n8\u21929: +1\n4\u21923: -1\n\nAgain, inconsistent. Third elements:\n\n2\u21926: +4\n8\u21929: +1\n6\u21922: -4\n2\u21926: +4\n\nHmm, maybe the operation depends on the number itself. Let's think of each input number being transformed by a function. For example, 3\u21924 (3+1), 1\u21925 (1+4), 2\u21926 (2+4). Wait, maybe adding 1, 4, 4 here. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, think modulo. For example, 3 mod something. Let's check:\n\nIn example0, 3\u21924: maybe 3+1=4. 1+4=5. 2+4=6. So for each position, adding 1, 4, 4. But that's not a pattern that holds across examples.\n\nLooking at example1: 2\u21926 (2+4), 3\u21924 (3+1), 8\u21929 (8+1). So here, first element adds 4, second adds 1, third adds 1. Hmm, maybe not.\n\nAnother approach: Look at the digits as individual digits. Maybe something like mirroring, or reversing. For example, 3 reversed is 3, but 4 is different. 2 reversed is 2, but in example1, 2 becomes 6. Not matching.\n\nWait, maybe each number is mapped to another number such that when added together they equal 10? Let's check:\n\nIn example0: 3 +4=7, 1+5=6, 2+6=8. No, sum isn't consistent. So that's not it.\n\nWait, maybe the sum of the input numbers equals the sum of the output numbers. Let's check:\n\nExample0 input sum: 3+1+2 =6. Output sum:4+5+6=15. 6 vs 15: 15 is 6*2.5. Not matching other examples.\n\nExample1 input sum: 2+3+8=13. Output sum:6+4+9=19. 13 vs 19: not a multiple.\n\nAnother idea: Maybe the output numbers are the result of applying some mathematical operation based on their positions. For example, first element: multiply by something, second add something, etc. Let's see:\n\nIn example0, first element 3\u21924. Let's see if 3 + (position index). The first position is 0 or 1? If 0, 3+0=3, no. If 1, 3+1=4. So maybe first element is input +1. Second element input 1 \u21925. 1 +4=5. Third element 2+4=6. So for first element +1, second and third +4. But in example1:\n\nFirst element 2 \u21926. 2+4=6. Second 3\u21924: +1. Third 8\u21929: +1. So here, first element +4, second and third +1. That's a different pattern. So position might matter. Maybe the operation depends on the position.\n\nWait, maybe the position in the triplet. For example, first element in the input is transformed differently based on its position. Let's check:\n\nIn example0: positions 0,1,2 (assuming 0-based).\n\n3 (pos0) \u21924: +1\n1 (pos1) \u21925: +4\n2 (pos2) \u21926: +4\n\nIn example1:\n\n2 (pos0) \u21926: +4\n3 (pos1) \u21924: +1\n8 (pos2) \u21929: +1\n\nExample2:\n\n5 (pos0) \u21921: -4\n8 (pos1) \u21929: +1\n6 (pos2) \u21922: -4\n\nExample3:\n\n9 (pos0) \u21928: -1\n4 (pos1) \u21923: -1\n2 (pos2) \u21926: +4\n\nThis is confusing. The transformations per position vary. For example, pos0 sometimes adds 1, sometimes 4, sometimes subtracts 4, etc.\n\nAlternative idea: Maybe each digit is replaced by the sum of the digits in the input. Wait, in example0, input is [3,1,2]. Sum is 6. Output numbers sum to 15. 15 is 6 multiplied by 2.5. Not sure.\n\nWait, let's check if the output is a permutation or rearrangement. For example0, output is [4,5,6], which is 3 consecutive numbers. Input is [3,1,2], which sorted is 1,2,3. Output sorted is 4,5,6. So maybe adding 3 to each. But in example0, input is [3,1,2] but output is [4,5,6], which is 3+1, 1+4, 2+4. Hmm, not adding the same value.\n\nWait, maybe it's related to the digits in another way. For example, 3 \u21924 (next number), 1\u21925 (1 +4), 2\u21926 (2 +4). So perhaps the first element is increased by 1, others by 4. But in example1, 2\u21926 (+4), 3\u21924 (+1), 8\u21929 (+1). That doesn't fit. So maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, think of each digit being mapped to the number of letters in its English word. Let's see:\n\n3 is \"three\" (5 letters). But output is 4. Doesn't match. 1 is \"one\" (3 letters), output is 5. Doesn't fit. So probably not.\n\nAnother approach: Maybe it's a cipher where each number is replaced by another according to a certain rule, like a Caesar cipher with shifts varying per position. For example, in example0, first element shifts by +1, second by +4, third by +4. Example1: first shifts +4, second +1, third +1. But why shifts change per example?\n\nAlternatively, the sum of all elements in the input. Let's check:\n\nExample0: sum is 3+1+2=6. Output sum is 4+5+6=15. 15 is 6 multiplied by 2.5. But example1: sum 13, output 19. 13 * 1.46. Not a consistent multiplier.\n\nHmm. Let's think of each output digit being related to the input digits in another way, such as multiplication modulo 10, or some combination.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each digit in the input is multiplied by a certain factor and then summed or something. For example:\n\nIn example0:\n\n3 \u21924: 3*1 +1 =4\n1 \u21925: 1*5 =5\n2 \u21926: 2*3 =6. Not a clear pattern.\n\nAnother idea: Looking at the individual digits, maybe they are transformed by a function that adds the number of vowels in their English names. For example:\n\n3 is \"three\" which has 2 vowels (e and e). 3 +2=5, but output is 4. Doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, the number of letters in the English word minus the digit. For example, \"three\" has 5 letters. 5-3=2. Not matching output 4.\n\nWait, maybe the digits are being mapped to letters (A=1, B=2, etc.), but then transformed somehow. For example, 3=C, 4=D. So maybe each input digit is mapped to the next letter. But 3\u21924 (D), which is next. 1\u2192B (2) but output is 5 (E). Doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each digit is replaced by 10 minus the digit. For example, 3 becomes 7 (10-3=7), but output is 4. No.\n\nAlternatively, think about the digits as parts of a date or time. Not sure.\n\nWait, let's look for a pattern where each output number is somehow derived from the entire input array. For example, in example0, input is [3,1,2]. Maybe the output is [3+1, 1+3+1, 2+3+1]. 3+1=4, 1+4=5, 2+4=6. But that's just adding the previous result each time. Let's check example1.\n\nInput [2,3,8]. If first output is 2 + 3 +8=13. Not 6. So that's not it.\n\nAnother approach: Maybe the output numbers are the result of some operation involving the digits of the input array. For example, sum all the input digits and use that sum to modify each digit.\n\nIn example0, sum is 6. 3 + (6 mod something)? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, sum of all input digits: example0 sum is 6. Maybe each output digit is 6 divided by something. But 4,5,6 don't directly relate.\n\nWait, let's look at the output numbers. In example0, [4,5,6] are consecutive numbers. Example1's output [6,4,9] is not. Example2's [1,9,2] not. Example3's [8,3,6] not. So that's not a pattern.\n\nAnother idea: Maybe each digit is transformed based on its parity. For example, even digits are divided by 2, odd digits are multiplied by something. Let's check:\n\nExample0 input [3,1,2] (all odd, odd, even).\n\nOutput 4,5,6. 3\u21924 (odd\u2192even, +1). 1\u21925 (odd\u2192odd, +4). 2\u21926 (even\u2192even, +4). Not sure.\n\nExample1 input [2,3,8] (even, odd, even). Output [6,4,9]. 2\u21926 (even\u2192even, *3). 3\u21924 (odd\u2192even, +1). 8\u21929 (even\u2192odd, +1). No consistent parity-based rule.\n\nHmm. Maybe think of each input triplet as a number, like 312, and then the output is a different number. Let's see:\n\nExample0 input 312 312 312. Output 456 456 456. So 312 becomes 456. How? 312 + 144 =456. 144 is 12 squared. Example1 input 238, output 649. 238 + 411=649. Not sure. Example2 input 586 \u2192 output 192. 586-394=192. Not a pattern.\n\nAlternatively, 3+1+2=6. 4+5+6=15. 15-6=9. 9 is a square of 3. Example1: 2+3+8=13. 6+4+9=19. 19-13=6. 6 is not a square. So no.\n\nAnother approach: Let's look for a pattern in the differences between input and output numbers across examples.\n\nExample0:\n\n3 \u21924 \u2192 diff +1\n\n1 \u21925 \u2192 diff +4\n\n2 \u21926 \u2192 diff +4\n\nExample1:\n\n2 \u21926 \u2192 +4\n\n3 \u21924 \u2192 +1\n\n8 \u21929 \u2192 +1\n\nExample2:\n\n5 \u21921 \u2192 -4\n\n8 \u21929 \u2192 +1\n\n6 \u21922 \u2192 -4\n\nExample3:\n\n9 \u21928 \u2192 -1\n\n4 \u21923 \u2192 -1\n\n2 \u21926 \u2192 +4\n\nSo the differences are:\n\nFor the first element:\n\n+1, +4, -4, -1\n\nSecond element:\n\n+4, +1, +1, -1\n\nThird element:\n\n+4, +1, -4, +4\n\nThis is quite varied. But perhaps there's a pattern in the differences per position.\n\nLooking at the first element differences: 1,4,-4,-1. Hmm. Maybe related to the number itself. For example, 3: difference +1 (3 mod 4 = 3 \u2192 3+1=4). 2: 2+4=6. 5: 5-4=1. 9:9-1=8. Not sure.\n\nAnother idea: The difference could be based on the sum of the other two numbers. Let's see for the first element:\n\nExample0: first element is 3. The other elements are 1 and 2. Sum is 3. 3 +1=4 (the output). So 3 +1 (sum of others) =4? No, sum of others is 3. 3+3=6, not 4. Doesn't fit.\n\nIn example1, first element is 2. Sum of others is 3+8=11. 2 +11=13, not 6.\n\nSo that's not it.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the difference is related to the position of the element. Like first element has a certain rule, second another, third another. But the differences vary even in the same position.\n\nWait, looking at the third elements:\n\nExample0: 2 \u21926: +4\n\nExample1:8\u21929: +1\n\nExample2:6\u21922: -4\n\nExample3:2\u21926: +4\n\nSo for third element, differences are +4, +1, -4, +4. Maybe the pattern here is alternating between +4 and -4, but with example1 breaking it. Not sure.\n\nAlternative approach: Maybe each output digit is the sum of the input digits modulo 10, plus some adjustment.\n\nFor example0:\n\n3+1+2=6. 6 modulo 10 is 6. Output starts with 4. Not directly related.\n\nAlternatively, each output digit is the sum of the input digits minus some value. 6 \u21924 (6-2=4). But how?\n\nAlternatively, think of each digit as being replaced by the sum of the other two digits. For example0:\n\n3 \u21921+2=3 \u2192 but output is 4. So 3+1=4? Not sure. For the first element in example1:2 \u21923+8=11. 11 mod 10 is 1, but output is 6. Doesn't fit.\n\nWait, maybe the output digits are the result of some mathematical operation involving all three input digits. For example, for the first element in example0: 3, 1, 2. Maybe (3 \u00d71) +1=4. For the second element: (3 \u00d71) +2=5. Third element: (3 \u00d72) +0=6. That fits example0, but let's check example1.\n\nExample1 input [2,3,8].\n\nFirst element output 6: (2\u00d73)+0=6. Yes.\n\nSecond element output 4: (2\u00d73) - 2=4. Or (2\u00d78) -12=4. Not sure.\n\nThird element output 9: (3\u00d78) -15=9. Not sure.\n\nThis might work for example0 and example1, but not sure about others.\n\nAlternatively, for example2: input [5,8,6].\n\nFirst output is1: (5\u00d78) + something? 5*8=40, which modulo 10 is 0. Not 1. Hmm.\n\nThis approach isn't working.\n\nMaybe the transformation is based on each digit's position in the list. For example, first digit is modified by a certain rule, second by another, third by another.\n\nLooking at the first digits across examples:\n\n3 \u21924 (diff +1)\n\n2 \u21926 (diff +4)\n\n5 \u21921 (diff -4)\n\n9 \u21928 (diff -1)\n\nSo the differences here are +1, +4, -4, -1. These numbers (1,4,4,1) are the squares of 1,2,2,1. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the difference for the first digit is based on its value modulo something. For example:\n\n3 mod 4 is 3 \u2192 difference is +1 (3+1=4)\n\n2 mod 4 is 2 \u2192 difference is +4 (2+4=6)\n\n5 mod 4 is 1 \u2192 difference is -4 (5-4=1)\n\n9 mod 4 is 1 \u2192 difference is -1 (9-1=8)\n\nBut this seems arbitrary. Why mod 4?\n\nAlternatively, the difference is the sum of the other two digits. For example0: first digit 3, other digits 1 and 2 sum to 3. So difference +1 (3+1=4). For example1: first digit 2, others sum to 11. 2+11=13 \u2192 13 mod 10 is 3. Not 6. Doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. Let's try to think of the output as a transformation of each digit where the transformation is based on the digit itself. For example:\n\nIf the digit is even, do X; if odd, do Y.\n\nLooking at example0:\n\n3 (odd) \u21924 (even). So maybe add 1.\n\n1 (odd) \u21925 (odd). Add 4.\n\n2 (even) \u21926 (even). Add 4.\n\nIn example1:\n\n2 (even) \u21926 (even): add 4.\n\n3 (odd) \u21924 (even): add 1.\n\n8 (even) \u21929 (odd): add 1.\n\nSo for even digits, sometimes add 4, sometimes add 1. For odd digits, add 1 or add4. Not a clear rule.\n\nAnother angle: Let's list all input and output numbers to see if there's a substitution cipher or permutation.\n\nInput digits across examples: 3,1,2,2,3,8,5,8,6,9,4,2.\n\nOutput digits:4,5,6,6,4,9,1,9,2,8,3,6.\n\nLooking for a possible mapping:\n\n3\u21924\n\n1\u21925\n\n2\u21926\n\n2\u21926 (same as above)\n\n3\u21924 (same as above)\n\n8\u21929\n\n5\u21921\n\n8\u21929\n\n6\u21922\n\n9\u21928\n\n4\u21923\n\n2\u21926 again.\n\nSo the mapping seems to be:\n\n3\u21924\n\n1\u21925\n\n2\u21926\n\n5\u21921\n\n8\u21929\n\n9\u21928\n\n4\u21923\n\n6\u21922\n\nSo this looks like pairs of swapped numbers:\n\n3 \u21944\n\n1 \u21945\n\n2 \u21946\n\n8 \u21949\n\nSo when the input has 3, it becomes 4, and vice versa. Similarly, 1 becomes 5, 5 becomes1, 2 becomes6,6 becomes2,8 becomes9,9 becomes8, and 4 becomes3.\n\nLet's check this with all examples.\n\nExample0 input [3,1,2]. Applying the swap:\n\n3\u21924, 1\u21925, 2\u21926 \u2192 Output [4,5,6]. Correct.\n\nExample1 input [2,3,8] \u2192 [6,4,9]. Correct.\n\nExample2 input [5,8,6] \u2192 [1,9,2]. Correct.\n\nExample3 input [9,4,2] \u2192 [8,3,6]. Correct.\n\nYes! This pattern fits all training examples. The transformation is swapping each digit with its pair:\n\n3 \u21944\n\n1 \u21945\n\n2 \u21946\n\n8 \u21949\n\n4 \u21943\n\n5 \u21941\n\n6 \u21942\n\n9 \u21948\n\nSo for each digit in the input, replace it with its pair. For example, 3 becomes4, 4 becomes3, 1 becomes5, etc.\n\nNow, applying this to the test input:\n\nTest Input: [8,1,3]\n\nSwap each according to the pairs:\n\n8 \u21929\n\n1 \u21925\n\n3 \u21924\n\nSo the output should be [9,5,4]. But since each triplet is repeated three times, the output is three times [9,5,4], but the examples show that each triplet in the output is the same as the others. So the final answer would be three copies of [9,5,4].",

        "cot_2": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. So, the problem is that given a list of three identical sublists in the input, the output is another list of three identical sublists with transformed numbers. Let's look at the examples one by one.\n\nStarting with Example 0:\nInput is three [3,1,2], and output is three [4,5,6]. Let's see each element transformation. 3\u21924, 1\u21925, 2\u21926. Hmm, maybe adding something? 3+1=4, 1+4=5, 2+4=6? Not sure. Wait, 3+1=4, 1+4=5, 2+4=6. But then why 1 and 4? Maybe there's a different pattern.\n\nExample 1:\nInput [2,3,8] becomes [6,4,9]. Let's check. 2\u21926, 3\u21924, 8\u21929. How? 2+4=6, 3+1=4, 8+1=9. Not consistent. Alternatively, maybe multiply each digit and add? Not obvious.\n\nWait, maybe each number is transformed by some rule. Let's look for a pattern across all examples.\n\nExample 0: Input elements are 3,1,2. Output is 4,5,6. So 3\u21924 (+1), 1\u21925 (+4), 2\u21926 (+4). Hmm, not a consistent addition.\n\nExample 1: 2\u21926 (+4), 3\u21924 (+1), 8\u21929 (+1). Again inconsistent addition.\n\nExample 2: Input [5,8,6] \u2192 [1,9,2]. 5\u21921 (maybe 5-4=1?), 8\u21929 (+1), 6\u21922 (6-4=2). So maybe subtracting 4 when the number is above a certain value. Let's see:\n\nIn Example 0: 3 is less than 5, so 3+1=4. 1 is less than 5, but 1+4=5. Wait, this doesn't fit.\n\nAnother approach: Maybe each digit is transformed into the next digit in some sequence. For instance, 3\u21924 (next number), 1\u21925 (next prime?), but 5 is the third prime after 1, not sure. Alternatively, maybe each digit is mapped to a specific other digit. Let's list all transformations:\n\nFrom example 0:\n3\u21924\n1\u21925\n2\u21926\n\nExample1:\n2\u21926\n3\u21924\n8\u21929\n\nExample2:\n5\u21921\n8\u21929\n6\u21922\n\nExample3:\n9\u21928\n4\u21923\n2\u21926\n\nLooking for patterns here. Let's see if there's a common rule for each number.\n\nLooking at 3: in example0, 3\u21924. But in example1, 3\u21924. So 3 always becomes 4? Wait no, in example0 input has 3, output 4. Example1 input has 3, output 4. So maybe 3 is always 4. Wait, but example3's output has 8,3,6. So input 9\u21928, 4\u21923, 2\u21926. Hmm, perhaps 3 is a fixed point?\n\nWait, but in the outputs, 3 appears as part of example3's output. Let's check the input for example3: input is [9,4,2]. Output is [8,3,6]. So 4\u21923. So maybe each digit is transformed by subtracting 1? 9\u21928 (9-1=8), 4\u21923 (4-1=3), but 2\u21926. That doesn't fit. So that's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each digit is transformed based on its position in a certain order. For example, maybe it's related to the number's position on a phone keypad. Let's think. On a phone keypad:\n\n1: no letters (maybe 1 is 1)\n2: ABC\n3: DEF\n4: GHI\n5: JKL\n6: MNO\n7: PQRS\n8: TUV\n9: WXYZ\n0: space or something.\n\nBut how would that map numbers? For example, in example0, 3\u21924. Phone keypad 3 is DEF. Maybe the number of letters? DEF has 3 letters. 3 letters \u2192 4? Not sure. Alternatively, the position in the keypad's row. For example, 3 is in row 1 (since 1,2,3 are row 1; 4,5,6 row 2; 7,8,9 row3; 0 row4). But not sure how that helps.\n\nAnother idea: Maybe it's about the sum of digits. For example, in example0, input rows sum to 3+1+2=6. Output rows sum to 4+5+6=15. 15 is 6 +9. Example1 input sum 2+3+8=13. Output 6+4+9=19. 19-13=6. Not a consistent difference. So that's probably not the pattern.\n\nAlternatively, the output digits could be each input digit multiplied by some number plus another. Let's see:\n\nIn example0, 3\u21924. Let's see possible operations. 3 *1 +1=4. 1*4 +1=5. 2*2 +2=6. Not consistent.\n\nAnother approach: Maybe each digit is replaced by the sum of its digits plus some value. But since all input digits are single digits, that doesn't help.\n\nWait, let's look for possible digit mappings. Let's list all input digits and their outputs:\n\nInput : Output\n3 \u21924 (Ex0)\n1 \u21925 (Ex0)\n2 \u21926 (Ex0)\n2 \u21926 (Ex1)\n3 \u21924 (Ex1)\n8 \u21929 (Ex1)\n5 \u21921 (Ex2)\n8 \u21929 (Ex2)\n6 \u21922 (Ex2)\n9 \u21928 (Ex3)\n4 \u21923 (Ex3)\n2 \u21926 (Ex3)\n\nLooking for each input digit's possible output:\n\n3 appears in Ex0 and Ex1. Both times it maps to 4. So 3\u21924.\n\n1\u21925 (Ex0). Also, in Ex1, input is 2,3,8; output 6,4,9. So 3\u21924 again. So 3 is always 4.\n\n2: In Ex0, 2\u21926. In Ex3, 2\u21926. In Ex1, input 8\u21929. So 2 maps to 6.\n\nWait, let's make a table:\n\nInput | Output\n3 \u21924\n1 \u21925\n2 \u21926\n2 \u21926 (again in Ex1? Wait, Ex1 input is 2,3,8. Output is 6,4,9. So the first element 2\u21926. So yes, 2\u21926.\n\nThen for 8 in Ex1 and Ex2: Ex1 input 8\u21929. Ex2 input 8\u21929. So 8\u21929.\n\n5 in Ex2: 5\u21921.\n\n9 in Ex3:9\u21928.\n\n4 in Ex3:4\u21923.\n\n6 in Ex2:6\u21922.\n\nSo perhaps each input digit is mapped to another digit via a specific rule. Let's see if we can find a pattern here.\n\nLooking at the mappings:\n\n3 \u21924 (+1)\n1 \u21925 (+4)\n2 \u21926 (+4)\n8 \u21929 (+1)\n5 \u21921 (-4)\n9 \u21928 (-1)\n4 \u21923 (-1)\n6 \u21922 (-4)\n\nHmm. The changes here are +1, +4, +4, +1, -4, -1, -1, -4.\n\nThis seems inconsistent. But perhaps there's a cycle or a pattern based on something else.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's a substitution cipher where each digit is replaced by another digit based on a certain key. For example, maybe each digit is mapped to 10 minus the original digit? Let's check:\n\n3 \u21927 (10-3=7), but output is 4. Not matching.\n\nAlternatively, 3 \u2192 (3 + some value modulo 9). For example, adding 1 modulo 9: 3+1=4 \u2192 yes. 1+4=5, 2+4=6. So for 3, adding 1; 1 and 2 adding 4. 8 is adding 1 (8+1=9). 5: 5-4=1. 9-1=8. 4-1=3. 6-4=2. So maybe the pattern is that even digits are being modified by -4, odd digits by +something?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the digits are being transformed based on their parity. Let's see:\n\nOdd digits:\n\n3 (odd) \u21924 (even, +1)\n1 (odd) \u21925 (odd, +4)\n5 (odd) \u21921 (odd, -4)\n9 (odd) \u21928 (even, -1)\n\nEven digits:\n\n2 (even) \u21926 (even, +4)\n8 (even) \u21929 (odd, +1)\n4 (even) \u21923 (odd, -1)\n6 (even) \u21922 (even, -4)\n\nNot a clear pattern here. Hmm.\n\nAnother thought: Maybe the output digits are the sum of the digits in the input array. Wait, example0's input is three [3,1,2]. The sum of all elements is 3+1+2=6, multiplied by 3 (since there are three sublists) gives 18. Not sure how that would map to the output [4,5,6].\n\nAlternatively, maybe each digit is transformed by adding the number of sublists. The input has three sublists. So adding 3 to each digit. For example0, 3+3=6, but output is 4. So no.\n\nWait, in example0, input is three [3,1,2]. So three times the same sublist. Output is three [4,5,6]. Maybe the transformation is that each digit is increased by 1, 4, 4 respectively. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, looking for a pattern that the output is the digits of the next number when the input is treated as a single number. For example, example0 input could be considered as 312 three times, and the next number might be 456, but 312 +1 is 313, which doesn't fit. So that's probably not the case.\n\nWait, let's think of each triplet as a single number. For example0, 312 \u2192 456. 312 + 144 = 456. Hmm, 144 is 12 squared. Example1: 238 \u2192 649. 238 + 411 = 649. Not sure. 144 and 411 don't form a pattern. Maybe not.\n\nAlternative approach: Let's look at each position in the sublist. For example, in the input, all sublists are the same, so maybe each element in the same position across all sublists is being transformed in the same way. But since all sublists are the same, the output is also the same.\n\nLooking at each position across examples:\n\nFor example0, input first elements are 3,3,3. Output is 4,4,4. So for 3, the first element in each sublist becomes 4. Similarly for other positions.\n\nBut the examples only have three sublists each, all identical, so the output is three identical sublists. So the transformation is applied to each element in the input sublist.\n\nSo the key is to find how each individual number in the input is transformed to the output.\n\nLooking again at the mappings:\n\n3 \u21924\n\n1 \u21925\n\n2 \u21926\n\n2 \u21926\n\n3 \u21924\n\n8 \u21929\n\n5 \u21921\n\n8 \u21929\n\n6 \u21922\n\n9 \u21928\n\n4 \u21923\n\n2 \u21926\n\nLooking for a possible substitution pattern.\n\nAnother idea: Maybe each digit is mapped to its position in the list of digits sorted in some order. Let's try sorting the digits. For example, in example0, input digits are 3,1,2. Sorted: 1,2,3. The output digits are 4,5,6. Which are the next three numbers. But example1's input sorted is 2,3,8, and output sorted is 4,6,9. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each digit is replaced by its position in a certain sequence. For example, the prime numbers. Let's list primes: 2,3,5,7,11,... but the output numbers are 4,5,6 (not primes). So that's probably not.\n\nWait, another angle: Let's consider the digits as positions on a 3x3 grid (like a numpad). Maybe moving in a certain direction. For example:\n\n1 is at (0,0), 2 at (0,1), 3 at (0,2)\n\n4 at (1,0), 5 at (1,1),6 at (1,2)\n\n7 at (2,0),8 at (2,1),9 at (2,2)\n\nMaybe each digit is transformed by moving the position in a certain way. For example, 3 is at (0,2). If you move down one (row+1), you get to row 1, same column \u2192 6. But in example0, 3\u21924. Hmm, 3 is at (0,2), moving right would go off the grid. Maybe another direction.\n\nAlternatively, replacing each digit with the digit to its right on the numpad. For example, 3 is to the right of 2, but in a numpad 3 is the rightmost of the top row. Moving right from 3 would go to nothing, but maybe wrapping around. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the digits are arranged in a circular pattern. For example, 1\u21925 could be moving four steps clockwise. Let's see:\n\nIf you imagine a circle with digits 1-9 arranged clockwise. Starting at 1, moving four steps: 1\u21922\u21923\u21924\u21925. So 1\u21925. Then 3\u21924: moving 1 step. 2\u21926: moving four steps (2\u21923\u21924\u21925\u21926). 8\u21929: moving one step. 5\u21921: moving four steps (5\u21926\u21927\u21928\u21929\u21921?) Wait, that's five steps. Not sure. This seems inconsistent.\n\nAlternatively, for each digit, the output is (digit + some function of the digit) modulo 10. For example:\n\n3\u21924: 3 +1 =4\n\n1\u21925: 1+4=5\n\n2\u21926:2+4=6\n\n8\u21929:8+1=9\n\n5\u21921:5-4=1 or 5+6=11 \u2192 1 (mod 10)\n\n9\u21928:9-1=8\n\n4\u21923:4-1=3\n\n6\u21922:6-4=2\n\nHmm, this seems like the transformation varies per digit. So maybe each digit has a specific transformation:\n\n3 \u21924 (+1)\n\n1 \u21925 (+4)\n\n2 \u21926 (+4)\n\n8 \u21929 (+1)\n\n5 \u21921 (-4)\n\n9 \u21928 (-1)\n\n4 \u21923 (-1)\n\n6 \u21922 (-4)\n\nSo the transformations for each digit are as follows. Now, trying to find a pattern here. For example:\n\nDigits 3,8 add +1.\n\nDigits 1,2 add +4.\n\nDigits 5,6 subtract 4.\n\nDigits 4,9 subtract 1.\n\nSo grouping them:\n\nAdd 1: 3,8\n\nAdd 4:1,2\n\nSubtract4:5,6\n\nSubtract1:4,9\n\nThis grouping seems arbitrary, but maybe there's a reason. Let's think about the position of these digits on a phone keypad:\n\n3 and 8 are in the top-right (3) and middle-right (8) positions. Hmm, maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the digits as pairs adding up to 10:\n\n3 and 7 (3+7=10), but not sure.\n\nWait, another idea: The transformation could be based on the digit's representation in a seven-segment display. Each digit is made up of certain segments, and the transformation is flipping certain segments. For example, adding a segment might turn a 3 into 9, but in our examples, 3\u21924.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output digit is the number of segments lit in the input digit. For example:\n\nDigit 1 has 2 segments, but 1\u21925. 5 has 5 segments. So no.\n\nAlternatively, the sum of the segments. 3 uses 5 segments. 4 uses 4. So 3\u21924: perhaps subtracting 1. But 1\u21925: 2 segments \u2192 5 (adding 3). Doesn't fit.\n\nHmm, this is getting complicated. Let's think of the transformations again:\n\n3 \u21924\n\n1 \u21925\n\n2 \u21926\n\n8 \u21929\n\n5 \u21921\n\n9 \u21928\n\n4 \u21923\n\n6 \u21922\n\nLooking for a reflection or rotation. For example, maybe the digits are being mirrored. For instance, 3 mirrored might look like something else. But 3 mirrored is not 4. Similarly, 2 mirrored could look like 5. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, consider the digits arranged in a circle from 1 to9, and each is rotated by a certain number of steps. For example:\n\nIf we arrange 1-9 in a circle clockwise: 1,2,3,6,9,8,7,4,1. Not sure.\n\nAnother approach: Let's look for the sum of input and output digits:\n\n3+4=7\n\n1+5=6\n\n2+6=8\n\n8+9=17\n\n5+1=6\n\n9+8=17\n\n4+3=7\n\n6+2=8\n\nThe sums are 7,6,8,17,6,17,7,8. Not a pattern. But maybe modulo something. 7 mod 9 is7, 6 mod9=6, 8 mod9=8, 17 mod9=8, etc. No pattern.\n\nWait, maybe the output digit is the input digit multiplied by some number modulo 9. For example:\n\n3*7=21 mod9=3 \u2192 not 4.\n\n1*5=5 mod9=5 \u2192 yes, but that's just 1\u21925. So 1*5=5. 3*? =4 mod9. 3* x \u22614 mod9. Solving 3x \u22614 mod9. Multiplicative inverse of 3 mod9 doesn't exist because 3 and9 are not coprime. So this approach might not work.\n\nAlternative idea: Maybe the digits are arranged in a 3x3 magic square. For example:\n\n4 9 2\n\n3 5 7\n\n8 1 6\n\nBut in that case, each row, column, and diagonal sums to 15. If the input digits are transformed to their positions in the magic square. For example, the magic square's first row is 4,9,2. If the input is [3,1,2], maybe looking at their positions. But 3 is in the second row first column. Output is 4,5,6. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each input digit is replaced by the corresponding digit in the magic square. For example, if the input is 3 (from the magic square's position), the output could be the magic square's digit in that position. But the magic square has 3 in position (2,0), which is the second row first column. But the output for 3 is 4. The magic square's (0,0) is 4. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the output is the complement to 10. For example, 3\u21927 (10-3), but in example0 it's 4. So that's not it.\n\nAnother approach: Let's check if the transformation for each digit is consistent across all examples. For example:\n\n- 3 appears in Ex0 and Ex1 and maps to 4 both times. So 3\u21924.\n\n- 2 appears in Ex0, Ex1, Ex3. Ex0:2\u21926, Ex1:2\u21926, Ex3:2\u21926. So 2\u21926.\n\n- 8 appears in Ex1 and Ex2, both times \u21929.\n\n- 5\u21921 (Ex2), 9\u21928 (Ex3), 4\u21923 (Ex3), 6\u21922 (Ex2).\n\nSo the mapping seems fixed. So the rule is substitution based on a predefined mapping:\n\n3 \u21924\n\n1 \u21925\n\n2 \u21926\n\n8 \u21929\n\n5 \u21921\n\n9 \u21928\n\n4 \u21923\n\n6 \u21922\n\nBut what about numbers not present in the examples, like 7? But since the test input is [8,1,3], which are all covered in the mapping.\n\nSo applying this mapping to the test input [8,1,3] would give:\n\n8\u21929\n\n1\u21925\n\n3\u21924\n\nSo the output sublist would be [9,5,4]. But wait, looking back at the examples:\n\nIn example3, input [9,4,2] \u2192 output [8,3,6]. So 9\u21928,4\u21923,2\u21926.\n\nWhich fits the mapping I listed.\n\nSo for the test input [8,1,3], the output would be [9,5,4], and since the output is three identical sublists, the output is:\n\n[9,5,4]\n\n[9,5,4]\n\n[9,5,4]\n\nBut let's check if this matches any existing patterns. Wait, in example1 input [2,3,8] becomes [6,4,9], which is 2\u21926,3\u21924,8\u21929. So yes, the mapping holds.\n\nSo applying the same substitution to the test input:\n\n8 \u21929\n\n1 \u21925\n\n3 \u21924\n\nThus, the output is [9,5,4] repeated three times."
