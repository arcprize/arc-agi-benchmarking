        "cot_1": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. So, looking at the training examples, each input has two parts: a 3x3 grid (maybe the first three rows) and another 3x3 grid (the next three rows), and the output is a 3x3 grid. My task is to see how the input grids are transformed into the output.\n\nLet me start by looking at Example 0. The input is two sets of three rows each. The first three rows are:\n\n[0,9,9]\n[0,9,9]\n[9,9,9]\n\nThen the next three rows:\n\n[0,1,0]\n[0,0,1]\n[1,1,1]\n\nThe output is:\n\n[2,0,0]\n[2,0,0]\n[0,0,0]\n\nHmm. Maybe the output is derived by combining the two input grids in some way. Let's see the elements. For each position in the output, how do the corresponding elements in the two input grids relate?\n\nTake the first element of the first row in Example 0: the first grid has 0, the second grid has 0. The output here is 2. Let's check another position. The second element of the first row in the first grid is 9, the second grid is 1. The output here is 0. Wait, 9 and 1 become 0. Hmm. Maybe there's a mathematical operation here. Let's think.\n\nWait, 0 and 0 in the first grid's first position and the second grid's first position give 2. Then maybe adding? But 0+0=0, not 2. Maybe subtraction. 9 - 9 would be 0, but in the output where the first grid is 9 and the second is 1 (like in Example 0's first row second element: 9 and 1), output is 0. Wait, 9-1=8, but output is 0. So that's not it.\n\nAlternatively, maybe looking at the presence of 9s. Like, 9s in the first grid might represent something. Let's see Example 0's first grid has a lot of 9s. The second grid has 0s and 1s and 1s. The output has 2s where in the first grid there are 0s. Wait, in the first grid's first row first element is 0, second grid's first element is 0. Output is 2. Maybe the 0 in both grids gives 2. Then maybe other combinations. Let's check another example.\n\nTake Example 1. Input first three rows:\n\n[9,0,9]\n[0,9,9]\n[0,0,9]\n\nSecond grid:\n\n[1,0,1]\n[1,0,0]\n[1,0,0]\n\nOutput:\n\n[0,2,0]\n[0,0,0]\n[0,2,0]\n\nLooking at the first element of the first row: first grid is 9, second grid is 1. Output is 0. So 9 and 1 gives 0. Hmm. What if the output is determined by the sum of the two grids in some way, but modulo something?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output counts how many times a 9 is in the first grid and a 1 in the second grid at the same position. Wait, let's check Example 0. In the first grid, positions with 0 and second grid 0 give output 2. Hmm. That doesn't fit. Wait maybe it's the sum of the two grids but converted into a different value. For instance, 0 (from first grid) + 0 (second) = 0, but output is 2. So maybe not. Alternatively, maybe it's 2 minus the sum of the two cells. Like, 0 + 0 = 0, so 2 -0 =2. If that's the case, then in Example 0's first cell, 0+0=0 \u2192 2. Let's check another cell. In Example 0's first grid, second element is 9, and second grid's second element is 1. 9+1=10. 2-10 is -8, which isn't 0. So that doesn't work.\n\nWait, maybe the output is 2 if both cells are 0, 0 otherwise. But in Example 0, the first two rows start with 0 in both grids. So output is 2. But in other positions, like third row first element in Example 0: first grid is 9, second grid is 1. Output is 0. But that doesn't explain other cases.\n\nLooking at Example 1's output, the 2s are where? The first output row's middle element is 2. Let's check the corresponding positions. First grid's first row middle is 0, second grid's first row middle is 0. So 0 and 0 gives 2. That aligns with the previous idea. Then in Example 1's third row middle element: first grid is 0, second grid is 0. Output is 2. So maybe when both grids have 0 in the same position, output is 2. Then where else do 2s occur?\n\nWait, Example 2's output is [2,0,2], [0,2,0], [0,2,2]. Let's check. For the first row first element: first grid is 0, second grid is 0. So 2. First row third element: first grid is 0, second grid is 0. Output 2. Then in the second row, the middle element: first grid is 0 (assuming the second grid's second row middle is 0. Let's check. Input for example 2's second grid rows:\n\n[0,0,0], [0,0,1], [1,0,0]. Wait, the first grid's rows are:\n\n[0,9,0], [9,0,9], [9,0,0]. Second grid's rows are [0,0,0], [0,0,1], [1,0,0]. So the output's second row middle is 2. Let's see the first grid's second row middle is 0, and the second grid's second row middle is 0. So again 0 and 0 gives 2. Then the third row's middle in output is 2. Let's check: first grid's third row middle is 0, second grid's third row middle is 0. So yes. So this pattern seems to hold: when a cell in both grids is 0, output is 2.\n\nBut wait, in Example 3's output, there's a 2 in the third row first element. Let's check the input. First grid's third row first element is 0 (input first grid rows: [0,0,9], [9,9,9], [0,9,0]. So third row first is 0. Second grid's third row first element is 0 (input second grid's third row is [0,0,1]. Wait, no. Wait, the second grid for Example 3 is:\n\n[1,0,0], [0,1,1], [0,0,1]. So third row first element is 0. So first grid third row first element is 0, second grid's third row first is 0. So output is 2 there, which matches. So that's consistent.\n\nSo when both grids have 0 in the same position, output is 2. Otherwise, maybe 0. But wait, some outputs have 0s and others have different numbers. Let's check other cells.\n\nTake Example 0's output first row, second element is 0. First grid here is 9, second grid is 1. So 9 and 1 gives 0. What about Example 1's output first row first element is 0. First grid is 9, second grid is 1. So again 9 and 1 gives 0.\n\nBut then, what about when one of the grids is 0 and the other isn't? For example, in Example 2's first row, second element is 0 in output. First grid's first row second element is 9, second grid's first row second element is 0. So 9 and 0. So output is 0.\n\nWait, but in some cases, maybe there's a different rule. Let's check Example 4's input. The first grid is:\n\n[0,9,0], [0,9,9], [0,9,9]\n\nSecond grid is:\n\n[0,0,0], [1,1,1], [1,0,1]\n\nThe output is:\n\n[2,0,2], [0,0,0], [0,0,0]\n\nSo in the first row, first element: first grid 0, second grid 0 \u2192 2. Third element: first grid 0, second grid 0 \u2192 2. Second element: first grid 9, second grid 0 \u2192 0. So that fits the previous pattern.\n\nBut what about when the second grid has 1? Let's see. For Example 0's third row third element: first grid is 9, second grid is 1. Output is 0. So 9 and 1 gives 0. What about when first grid is 9 and second grid is 0? Like in Example 1's first row first element: 9 and 1. Output 0. Wait, no, that's 9 and 1. Hmm. Wait, perhaps the output is 2 only when both grids have 0. Otherwise, if either grid has a 9 and the other has a 1, then 0. But what about when one is 9 and the other is 0?\n\nWait, take Example 2's output third row third element is 2. Let's check: first grid's third row third element is 0 (input first grid's third row is [9,0,0]), and second grid's third row third element is 0 (input second grid's third row is [1,0,0]. Wait, third element is 0. So 0 and 0 \u2192 2. So that fits.\n\nAnother example: Example 3's output first row second element is 2? Wait no, output is [0,2,0] in the first row. Let me check the input. First grid first row second element is 0 (input first grid is [0,0,9]), second grid first row second element is 0 (second grid first row is [1,0,0]. So 0 and 0 \u2192 2. So that's correct.\n\nSo the pattern seems to be: for each cell in the output, if the corresponding cell in both the first grid and the second grid is 0, then the output is 2. Otherwise, the output is 0.\n\nWait, but wait. Let's check another case. Take Example 2's input:\n\nFirst grid:\n\n[0,9,0]\n\n[9,0,9]\n\n[9,0,0]\n\nSecond grid:\n\n[0,0,0]\n\n[0,0,1]\n\n[1,0,0]\n\nThe output is:\n\n[2,0,2]\n\n[0,2,0]\n\n[0,2,2]\n\nLooking at the third row third column: first grid is 0, second grid is 0 \u2192 output 2. That fits.\n\nBut the second row middle cell: first grid is 0 (second row middle of first grid is 0?), let's check. First grid's second row is [9,0,9], so middle is 0. Second grid's second row is [0,0,1], middle is 0. So 0 and 0 \u2192 output 2. But the output in that position is 2 (since the output's second row is [0,2,0]. So yes.\n\nBut what about the third row's first element in Example 2's output: output is 0. First grid's third row first element is 9, second grid's third row first element is 1 (since third row of second grid is [1,0,0]. So 9 and 1 \u2192 output 0.\n\nSo the rule so far is: if both cells are 0 \u2192 output 2. Otherwise, 0.\n\nBut wait, looking at Example 3's output:\n\nOutput is:\n\n[0,2,0]\n\n[0,0,0]\n\n[2,0,0]\n\nCheck first row first element: first grid is 0 (first grid's first row is [0,0,9], second grid's first row is [1,0,0]. So first grid's first element is 0, second grid's first element is 1. So 0 and 1 \u2192 output 0. Which is correct. But the third row first element in output is 2. So first grid's third row first element is 0, second grid's third row first element is 0 \u2192 output 2. That fits.\n\nSo this seems to hold. So the output is 2 where both grids have 0, else 0. But wait, in all examples, the output is 2s and 0s. So the rule could be: for each cell, if the corresponding cell in both input grids (first and second) is 0, then output 2, else 0.\n\nBut wait, in Example 4's output, the first row is [2,0,2]. Let's check first grid first row: [0,9,0], second grid first row: [0,0,0]. So first element: 0 and 0 \u2192 2. Second element: 9 and 0 \u2192 0. Third element: 0 and 0 \u2192 2. So that's correct.\n\nBut then, why in Example 0's output, the third row is [0,0,0]. Let's see. First grid third row is [9,9,9], second grid third row is [1,1,1]. So all cells are 9 and 1 \u2192 output 0. That fits.\n\nWait, but in Example 1's output, there are some 0s and 2s. Let me check again. The output is:\n\n[0,2,0]\n\n[0,0,0]\n\n[0,2,0]\n\nSo the first row's middle is 2. First grid's first row middle is 0 (input first grid first row is [9,0,9]), second grid's first row middle is 0 (second grid first row is [1,0,1]. So 0 and 0 \u2192 2. Correct. Third row middle: first grid third row middle is 0 (third row of first grid is [0,0,9]), second grid third row middle is 0 (third row of second grid is [1,0,0]. So 0 and 0 \u2192 2. So output's third row middle is 2. So the output's third row is [0,2,0], which matches.\n\nSo this rule seems consistent across all examples. So the output is 2 where both input grids (the first three rows and the next three) have 0 in the same position, else 0.\n\nBut wait, let's check the test input.\n\nTest input:\n\nFirst three rows (first grid):\n\n[9,0,9]\n\n[0,0,9]\n\n[9,0,9]\n\nNext three rows (second grid):\n\n[0,1,1]\n\n[0,1,0]\n\n[1,0,0]\n\nSo, let's go cell by cell.\n\nFirst row first column: first grid 9, second grid 0 \u2192 0.\n\nFirst row second column: first grid 0, second grid 1 \u2192 0 (since not both 0).\n\nFirst row third column: first grid 9, second grid 1 \u2192 0.\n\nSecond row first column: first grid 0, second grid 0 \u2192 2.\n\nSecond row second column: first grid 0, second grid 1 \u2192 0.\n\nSecond row third column: first grid 9, second grid 0 \u2192 0.\n\nThird row first column: first grid 9, second grid 1 \u2192 0.\n\nThird row second column: first grid 0, second grid 0 \u2192 2.\n\nThird row third column: first grid 9, second grid 0 \u2192 0.\n\nSo the output grid would be:\n\nRow 1: [0, 0, 0]\n\nRow 2: [2, 0, 0]\n\nRow 3: [0, 2, 0]\n\nBut wait, let's arrange that into 3 rows. Wait, the output is 3x3. So each row:\n\nRow 1: 0,0,0\n\nRow 2: 2,0,0\n\nRow 3: 0,2,0\n\nWait, but looking at the training examples, the outputs are formatted as three rows each with three elements. So in this case, the output would be:\n\n[0, 0, 0]\n\n[2, 0, 0]\n\n[0, 2, 0]\n\nBut let me check if that's correct according to the pattern.\n\nWait, in the first row of the test input's first grid is [9,0,9], second grid's first row is [0,1,1]. So positions:\n\n(0,0): 9 and 0 \u2192 0 (since both not 0)\n\n(0,1): 0 and 1 \u2192 not both 0 \u2192 0\n\n(0,2):9 and1 \u21920.\n\nSo first row output: [0,0,0]\n\nSecond row: first grid [0,0,9], second grid [0,1,0].\n\nPositions:\n\n(1,0): 0 and 0 \u2192 2.\n\n(1,1):0 and1 \u21920.\n\n(1,2):9 and0 \u21920.\n\nSo second row output: [2,0,0]\n\nThird row: first grid [9,0,9], second grid [1,0,0].\n\nPositions:\n\n(2,0):9 and1 \u21920.\n\n(2,1):0 and0 \u21922.\n\n(2,2):9 and0 \u21920.\n\nSo third row output: [0,2,0]\n\nSo the output is:\n\n[0,0,0]\n\n[2,0,0]\n\n[0,2,0]\n\nBut wait, looking at the training examples, for example Example 1's output:\n\n[0,2,0]\n\n[0,0,0]\n\n[0,2,0]\n\nWhich is three rows. So according to this, the test input's output would be three rows as I outlined. But looking at the training examples, sometimes the output has 2s in different positions, like Example 2's output has multiple 2s. But according to the rule we found, this seems correct.\n\nBut wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me re-verify.\n\nAnother way to check: the test input's second row first element is 0 in both grids (first grid's second row first element is 0, second grid's second row first element is 0. So output 2 here. So second row first element is 2, others in that row are 0. Third row second element is 0 in both grids \u2192 output 2.\n\nSo the output should be:\n\nRow 1: 0 0 0\n\nRow 2: 2 0 0\n\nRow 3: 0 2 0\n\nYes, that's correct according to the pattern.\n\nBut looking back at the training examples, the outputs sometimes have multiple 2s. Like Example 2's output is [2,0,2], [0,2,0], [0,2,2]. Which is because in those positions, both grids have 0s. So applying the same logic, the test input's output should be as I determined.\n\nSo I think this is the correct pattern. Therefore, the final answer should be the grid I calculated.",

        "cot_2": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. So, we have these input grids and output grids, and we need to determine how the input maps to the output. Let's start by looking at the training examples closely.\n\nFirst, let's note that each input has two sets of three rows each. For example, Example 0 has six rows, split into two groups of three. The output is three rows. So maybe the first three rows are one part and the next three are another, and they're combined somehow to get the output.\n\nLooking at Example 0:\n\nINPUT:\n[0,9,9]\n[0,9,9]\n[9,9,9]\n[0,1,0]\n[0,0,1]\n[1,1,1]\n\nOUTPUT:\n[2,0,0]\n[2,0,0]\n[0,0,0]\n\nHmm. The output has three rows. Let's compare the first three input rows (let's call them part A) and the next three (part B). For each position in the output, maybe it's combining elements from part A and part B. Let's see.\n\nLooking at the first element of the output [2,0,0]. The first row of part A is [0,9,9], and the corresponding part B's first row is [0,1,0]. How does 0 and 0 become 2? That's confusing. Wait, maybe there's a different approach.\n\nAnother thought: Maybe the output is generated by comparing the two parts. For example, if in a certain position, part A has a 9 and part B has a 1, maybe that's turned into a 2. Or some other combination.\n\nLooking at Example 0's output first row [2,0,0]. Let's see the corresponding positions in part A and B.\n\nPart A row 1: 0,9,9\nPart B row 1: 0,1,0\n\nSo for the first element: 0 (A) and 0 (B) \u2192 2? Wait, that doesn't make sense. Maybe it's adding, but 0+0 is 0, not 2. Alternatively, maybe when both parts have 0, it's 2. But in the second element of the first row: A has 9, B has 1. So 9 and 1 \u2192 0. Third element: A 9, B 0 \u2192 0. Hmm, not sure yet.\n\nAlternatively, maybe part A and part B are being subtracted or something. Let's check other examples.\n\nTake Example 1:\n\nINPUT (part A):\n[9,0,9]\n[0,9,9]\n[0,0,9]\n\npart B:\n[1,0,1]\n[1,0,0]\n[1,0,0]\n\nOUTPUT:\n[0,2,0]\n[0,0,0]\n[0,2,0]\n\nLooking at the first output row [0,2,0]. Part A first row [9,0,9], part B first row [1,0,1]. How does that map to 0,2,0? Let's see each position:\n\nFirst element: 9 (A) and 1 (B) \u2192 0. Second: 0 and 0 \u2192 2. Third: 9 and 1 \u2192 0. So maybe when both are 0, it's 2, otherwise, if A is 9 and B is 1, it's 0? But in Example 0, part A had 0 and B had 0, leading to 2. Wait, that's the same as here. So maybe the rule is: for each position, if part A has 0 and part B has 0 \u2192 2. But how about other combinations?\n\nWait in Example 0, part A's first row first element is 0 (A) and part B first row first element is 0 (B) \u2192 output 2. That fits. Then in Example 1, part A's first row second element is 0 (A) and part B first row second is 0 (B) \u2192 output 2. So that's consistent. So maybe when both A and B have 0 in the same position, output is 2. But then what about other cases.\n\nIn Example 0's output, the second row is [2,0,0]. Part A's second row is [0,9,9], part B's second row [0,0,1]. The first element here is 0 (A) and 0 (B), leading to 2. The second element: A is 9, B is 0 \u2192 output 0. Third element: 9 and 1 \u2192 0. So maybe when A is 0 and B is 0 \u2192 2. For other combinations, if A is 9 and B is 1, then 0? Or maybe it's different.\n\nWait, but in Example 1's output, third row [0,2,0]. Part A third row is [0,0,9], part B third row [1,0,0]. The second element here is A 0 and B 0 \u2192 2. The other elements: A 0 and B 1 \u2192 0? But in Example 0's part B third row is [1,1,1], and part A third row is [9,9,9]. The output third row is [0,0,0]. So when A is 9 and B is 1, output 0.\n\nWait, putting this together: for each position, if in part A and part B, the numbers are (0,0) \u2192 2. If part A is 9 and part B is 1 \u2192 0. But other combinations? Let's check.\n\nIn Example 2's input:\n\nPart A:\n\n[0,9,0]\n[9,0,9]\n[9,0,0]\n\nPart B:\n\n[0,0,0]\n[0,0,1]\n[1,0,0]\n\nOutput:\n\n[2,0,2]\n[0,2,0]\n[0,2,2]\n\nFirst row of output: [2,0,2]. Let's see the corresponding A and B.\n\nA row 1: 0,9,0\n\nB row 1: 0,0,0\n\nSo positions:\n\n(0,0) \u2192 2 (first element)\n\n(9,0) \u2192 0 (second element)\n\n(0,0) \u2192 2 (third element)\n\nSo yes, when A is 0 and B is 0 \u2192 2. For (9,0) \u2192 0. Then what about (9,1)?\n\nIn Example 3's input:\n\nPart A:\n\n[0,0,9]\n[9,9,9]\n[0,9,0]\n\nPart B:\n\n[1,0,0]\n[0,1,1]\n[0,0,1]\n\nOutput:\n\n[0,2,0]\n[0,0,0]\n[2,0,0]\n\nLooking at output first row [0,2,0]. A row 1: 0,0,9; B row 1: 1,0,0. So first element: A 0, B 1 \u2192 0. Second element A 0, B 0 \u2192 2. Third element A 9, B 0 \u2192 0. So that fits the previous pattern. So the rule seems to be:\n\nFor each position (i,j) in the grid:\n\nIf A[i][j] is 0 and B[i][j] is 0 \u2192 output 2.\n\nIf A[i][j] is 9 and B[i][j] is 1 \u2192 output 0.\n\nWait, but in Example 1's part B first row: [1,0,1], part A first row [9,0,9]. The output first row is [0,2,0]. So for positions where A is 9 and B is 1, output is 0. For A 0 and B 0 \u2192 2. Other combinations?\n\nIn Example 2, part B third row is [1,0,0], part A third row is [9,0,0]. So the first element is A 9, B 1 \u2192 0. The second element A 0, B 0 \u2192 2. Third element A 0, B 0 \u2192 2. So output is [0,2,2], but the actual output third row is [0,2,2], which matches.\n\nWhat about when A is 0 and B is 1? Like in Example 3's part B first row first element: B is 1, A is 0. The output for that position is 0. So perhaps whenever the combination is (0,0) \u2192 2, otherwise, if A is 9 and B is 1 \u2192 0, and for other combinations (like 0 and 1, 9 and 0, etc.), the output is 0. But wait, in some cases, like when A is 9 and B is 0, what happens?\n\nLooking at Example 0's part A first row: [0,9,9], part B first row [0,1,0]. Output first row is [2,0,0]. The third element: A is 9, B is 0 \u2192 output 0. So perhaps any combination except (0,0) leads to 0, except when A is 9 and B is 1, which also leads to 0. Wait, that's the same as all non-(0,0) cases result in 0. But in Example 2's output third row: [0,2,2]. The third row of part A is [9,0,0], part B is [1,0,0]. So for the third element: A 0, B 0 \u2192 2. Second element: A 0, B 0 \u2192 2. First element: A 9, B 1 \u2192 0. So yes, only (0,0) gives 2, others 0.\n\nBut wait, in Example 4's input:\n\nPart A:\n\n[0,9,0]\n[0,9,9]\n[0,9,9]\n\nPart B:\n\n[0,0,0]\n[1,1,1]\n[1,0,1]\n\nOutput:\n\n[2,0,2]\n[0,0,0]\n[0,0,0]\n\nLooking at the first row of output: [2,0,2]. Part A first row [0,9,0], part B first row [0,0,0]. So (0,0) \u2192 2, (9,0) \u2192 0, (0,0) \u2192 2. So again, same pattern.\n\nSo the pattern seems to be: for each cell in the output, if the corresponding cells in part A and part B are both 0, then the output is 2. Otherwise, the output is 0. But wait, no. Let's check Example 2's output.\n\nWait in Example 2's output, the third row is [0,2,2]. The part B third row is [1,0,0], part A third row is [9,0,0]. So the first element of the third row is part A 9, part B 1 \u2192 output 0. Second and third elements: part A 0, part B 0 \u2192 2. So yes. So the rule is: output 2 only where both part A and part B are 0. All others 0.\n\nBut wait, in Example 3's output:\n\nPart A third row [0,9,0], part B third row [0,0,1]. Output third row is [2,0,0]. So for the first element: A 0 and B 0 \u2192 2. Second element: A 9 and B 0 \u2192 0. Third element: A 0 and B 1 \u2192 0. So yes, only (0,0) gives 2, others 0.\n\nBut then, how does this fit with the outputs in Example 1? Let's check.\n\nExample 1's output:\n\n[0,2,0]\n[0,0,0]\n[0,2,0]\n\nLooking at the third row: part A third row [0,0,9], part B third row [1,0,0]. The second element is A 0 and B 0 \u2192 2. The first element is A 0 and B 1 \u2192 0. Third element A 9 and B 0 \u2192 0. So output [0,2,0], which matches.\n\nSo this seems to hold.\n\nBut wait, let's check all examples again with this rule. For each cell, if both A and B are 0 \u2192 2, else 0.\n\nExample 0's output first row: part A first row [0,9,9], part B first row [0,1,0]. So (0,0) \u2192 2, (9,1) \u2192 0, (9,0) \u2192 0. Output is [2,0,0]. Correct.\n\nExample 1's first output row: part A first row [9,0,9], part B first row [1,0,1]. So (9,1) \u2192 0, (0,0) \u2192 2, (9,1) \u2192 0. Output [0,2,0]. Correct.\n\nExample 2's output first row: part A first row [0,9,0], part B first row [0,0,0]. So (0,0) \u2192 2, (9,0) \u2192 0, (0,0) \u2192 2. Output [2,0,2]. Correct.\n\nExample 3's first output row: part A [0,0,9], part B [1,0,0]. So (0,1) \u2192 0, (0,0) \u2192 2, (9,0) \u21920. Output [0,2,0]. Correct.\n\nExample 4's output first row: part A [0,9,0], part B [0,0,0]. So (0,0) \u21922, (9,0)\u21920, (0,0)\u21922. Output [2,0,2]. Correct.\n\nYes, this seems to fit all examples. So the rule is: for each position, if in part A and part B (the first three rows and the next three rows) the value is 0 in both, then the output is 2. Otherwise, output 0.\n\nBut wait, let me check Example 4's part B. Part B is:\n\n[0,0,0]\n[1,1,1]\n[1,0,1]\n\nThe output is [2,0,2], [0,0,0], [0,0,0]. So the second and third rows of output are all 0. Let's see part A's second and third rows:\n\nPart A second row: [0,9,9], part B second row [1,1,1]. All cells in part B second row are 1, so no (0,0) \u2192 all output 0.\n\nPart A third row: [0,9,9], part B third row [1,0,1]. So first element: A 0 and B 1 \u21920, second: 9 and 0 \u21920, third:9 and1\u21920. So output third row [0,0,0]. Correct.\n\nSo the rule is that the output is 2 where both part A and part B have 0, else 0.\n\nBut wait, in Example 1's part B third row is [1,0,0], part A third row is [0,0,9]. The output third row is [0,2,0]. So for the second element, part A is 0 and B is 0 \u2192 2. Others are 0. Correct.\n\nNow, the test input is:\n\nTest Input:\n\n[9, 0, 9]\n[0, 0, 9]\n[9, 0, 9]\n[0, 1, 1]\n[0, 1, 0]\n[1, 0, 0]\n\nSo the first three rows are part A, the next three part B.\n\nWe need to compare each position in part A and part B. For each cell where both are 0, output 2; else 0.\n\nLet's process each cell:\n\nRow 1 of output (part A row 1 and part B row 1):\n\nA row 1: [9, 0, 9]\n\nB row 1: [0, 1, 1]\n\nCompare each element:\n\n9 vs 0 \u2192 no, so 0.\n\n0 vs 1 \u2192 no, so 0.\n\n9 vs 1 \u2192 no, so 0.\n\nSo first output row: [0,0,0]\n\nWait, but wait. Wait part B is the next three rows. So part B is the 4th,5th,6th rows. Let me recheck:\n\nTest Input:\n\n[9, 0, 9] --> part A row 1\n\n[0, 0, 9] --> part A row 2\n\n[9, 0, 9] --> part A row 3\n\nThen part B:\n\n[0, 1, 1] --> part B row 1\n\n[0, 1, 0] --> part B row 2\n\n[1, 0, 0] --> part B row 3\n\nSo output has three rows, each corresponding to the same rows in part A and B. So:\n\nFor output row 1: compare part A row 1 and part B row 1.\n\nA row 1: [9, 0, 9]\n\nB row 1: [0, 1, 1]\n\nCheck each element:\n\nFirst element: 9 (A) vs 0 (B) \u2192 not both 0 \u2192 output 0.\n\nSecond: 0 vs 1 \u2192 not both 0 \u2192 0.\n\nThird: 9 vs 1 \u2192 0.\n\nSo output row 1: [0,0,0]\n\nOutput row 2: compare part A row 2 and part B row 2.\n\nA row 2: [0,0,9]\n\nB row 2: [0,1,0]\n\nCheck each:\n\nFirst: 0 vs 0 \u2192 yes \u2192 2.\n\nSecond: 0 vs 1 \u2192 no \u2192 0.\n\nThird: 9 vs 0 \u2192 no \u2192 0.\n\nSo output row 2: [2,0,0]\n\nOutput row 3: compare part A row 3 and part B row3.\n\nA row3: [9,0,9]\n\nB row3: [1,0,0]\n\nCheck each element:\n\nFirst:9 vs1 \u2192 0.\n\nSecond:0 vs0 \u21922.\n\nThird:9 vs0 \u21920.\n\nSo output row3: [0,2,0]\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nOutput rows:\n\n[0,0,0]\n\n[2,0,0]\n\n[0,2,0]\n\nBut let's look at the training examples to see how the output is structured. For example, in Example 1, the output is:\n\n[0,2,0]\n\n[0,0,0]\n\n[0,2,0]\n\nWhich corresponds to part A rows 1-3 and part B rows 1-3.\n\nSo the test input's output would be:\n\nFirst row (A1 vs B1): [0,0,0]\n\nSecond row (A2 vs B2): [2,0,0]\n\nThird row (A3 vs B3): [0,2,0]\n\nSo the final output is:\n\n[0,0,0]\n\n[2,0,0]\n\n[0,2,0]\n\nBut wait, let's check if there's any other pattern. Wait, maybe the output is the same as part B but with 1s replaced with 0s and 0s replaced with 2s where part A is 0. But no, because in the examples, it's based on both A and B being 0.\n\nWait, no. Our initial conclusion was that output is 2 where both A and B are 0, else 0.\n\nSo according to that, the test output should be:\n\nRow 1: 0,0,0\n\nRow 2: 2,0,0\n\nRow3: 0,2,0\n\nSo the output is:\n\n[0,0,0]\n\n[2,0,0]\n\n[0,2,0]\n\nBut wait, looking back at the training examples, the output is written as three rows. Let's see if there's any other aspect we might have missed.\n\nWait in Example 0's input part B is three rows: [0,1,0], [0,0,1], [1,1,1]. The output is three rows. So yes, each output row is derived from the corresponding rows of part A and B.\n\nSo for the test input, the output should be three rows as computed.\n\nSo the final answer should be:\n\n[0,0,0]\n\n[2,0,0]\n\n[0,2,0]\n\nBut let's check if any of the training examples have a similar structure.\n\nWait, for example, in Example 1's output, the third row is [0,2,0], which is when part A's third row has 0,0,9 and part B's third row has 1,0,0. The second element (0,0) gives 2.\n\nSo yes, the test case's output seems to fit."
