        "cot_1": "Okay, let's see. I need to figure out the pattern from the training examples to apply it to the test input. Let's start by looking at each example one by one.\n\nIn Example 0:\nInput is three rows:\n[0,0,0]\n[1,0,0]\n[0,1,0]\nOutput is [1,1]. Hmm. Let me think about how those numbers relate. The input has 1s in the second and third rows. Maybe looking at the positions of non-zero numbers. The first row has all zeros. The second row has a 1 in the first position. The third row has a 1 in the second position. The output is two 1s. Maybe counting the number of non-zero elements in each column? Let me check. Column 1 has 1 (from second row), column 2 has 1 (from third row), column 3 has all zeros. But the output is two 1s. So maybe the output is the sum of non-zero elements in each column, but that doesn't fit because column 1 has one, column 2 has one, column 3 zero. So output would be [1,1,0], but the output here is [1,1]. So that's not it.\n\nWait, maybe the output is the count of non-zero elements in each row? Let's see. First row has 0, second row has 1, third row has 1. Summing rows gives 0,1,1. But output is [1,1]. Maybe ignoring the first row? Or perhaps looking at the positions where non-zero elements are present and aggregating them in some way. Alternatively, maybe the output is the sum of non-zero elements in each diagonal?\n\nAnother approach: looking at the positions of the non-zero elements. Let's index each element as rows and columns. For example 0:\n\nRow 0: all zeros.\n\nRow 1: [1,0,0] \u2192 column 0.\n\nRow 2: [0,1,0] \u2192 column 1.\n\nSo in the input, non-zero elements are at positions (1,0) and (2,1). The output is [1,1]. So maybe each element in the output corresponds to the number of times a non-zero element appears in each diagonal. Wait, how do the diagonals work here?\n\nIf we consider the main diagonals (top-left to bottom-right), then position (1,0) is part of a diagonal? Let me see:\n\nIn a 3x3 grid, the main diagonal is (0,0), (1,1), (2,2). The anti-diagonal is (0,2), (1,1), (2,0). Then other diagonals might be those moving in other directions. Alternatively, perhaps looking at the sum along anti-diagonals. Let me try that.\n\nFor example 0:\n\nAnti-diagonals would start from the top-right and move down-left. Let's list them:\n\nFirst anti-diagonal (length 1): (0,2) \u2192 0.\n\nSecond anti-diagonal (length 2): (0,1), (1,2) \u2192 0 and 0.\n\nThird anti-diagonal (length 3): (0,0), (1,1), (2,2) \u2192 0,0,0.\n\nFourth anti-diagonal (length 2): (1,0), (2,1) \u2192 1 and 1. Summing those gives 2, but output is [1,1]. Hmm, maybe not sum but the values themselves. Then the fourth anti-diagonal has 1 and 1, but the output is [1,1]. Wait, maybe each non-zero element in the anti-diagonals contributes to the output elements. Let's see:\n\nFor example 0:\n\nThe non-zero elements are at (1,0) and (2,1). Let's check which anti-diagonals they belong to.\n\nThe position (1,0) is part of the anti-diagonal starting from (1,0) and moving up-right? Or maybe the anti-diagonal is determined by the sum of the row and column indices. For anti-diagonals, each diagonal is defined by i + j being a constant. Let's see:\n\nFor (1,0): i=1, j=0 \u2192 sum 1.\n\nFor (2,1): i=2, j=1 \u2192 sum 3.\n\nWait, maybe not. Alternatively, in standard matrix anti-diagonals, the sum i + j gives the level. For example:\n\nAnti-diagonal 0: (0,0) \u2192 sum 0.\n\nAnti-diagonal 1: (0,1), (1,0) \u2192 sum 1.\n\nAnti-diagonal 2: (0,2), (1,1), (2,0) \u2192 sum 2.\n\nAnti-diagonal 3: (1,2), (2,1) \u2192 sum 3.\n\nAnti-diagonal 4: (2,2) \u2192 sum 4.\n\nWait, maybe not. Let me think again. For a 3x3 matrix:\n\nThe anti-diagonals can be listed as:\n\n- (0,0)\n\n- (0,1), (1,0)\n\n- (0,2), (1,1), (2,0)\n\n- (1,2), (2,1)\n\n- (2,2)\n\nSo each anti-diagonal is grouped by the sum of i + j. For example, sum=0 \u2192 (0,0); sum=1 \u2192 (0,1) and (1,0); sum=2 \u2192 (0,2), (1,1), (2,0); sum=3 \u2192 (1,2), (2,1); sum=4 \u2192 (2,2).\n\nSo the non-zero elements in example 0 are at (1,0) which is sum 1, and (2,1) which is sum 3. But the output is [1,1]. Hmm. Maybe the output counts the non-zero elements in each anti-diagonal, but only for those anti-diagonals that have non-zero elements. For example 0, sum 1 has 1 non-zero (the 1 at (1,0)), and sum 3 has 1 non-zero (the 1 at (2,1)). But the output is two 1s, so maybe each anti-diagonal with non-zero elements contributes their counts? Then output would be [1 (from sum 1), 1 (from sum 3)]. But how are these ordered? Because sum increases from 0 to 4. So if the output lists the counts in the order of their sum, but only for those sums that have non-zero elements, then for example 0, the sums with non-zero are 1 and 3, but the output is [1,1]. But in the output, the order is [1,1]. But the sum 1 comes before sum 3, so perhaps that's the order. But then why in example 1:\n\nExample1 input:\n\n[0,2,0]\n[2,0,0]\n[0,2,0]\n\nNon-zero elements are at (0,1): 2; (1,0):2; (2,1):2.\n\nSum for (0,1) is 1, (1,0) is 1 (sum 1), (2,1) is sum 3. So the anti-diagonal sums 1 and 3. Each has two elements in sum 1: (0,1) and (1,0), but each has a 2. Wait, the input here is:\n\nRow 0: [0,2,0] \u2192 (0,1) \u2192 sum 1.\n\nRow 1: [2,0,0] \u2192 (1,0) \u2192 sum 1.\n\nRow 2: [0,2,0] \u2192 (2,1) \u2192 sum 3.\n\nSo the sum 1 has two elements (both 2s), sum 3 has one element (2). But the output is [2,2,2]. Wait, that doesn't fit. The output in example1 is [2,2,2]. So maybe the approach is different.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by concatenating the non-zero elements in each anti-diagonal, ordered by the sum of their coordinates (i+j), and for each anti-diagonal, the elements are taken from top to bottom (or left to right?).\n\nWait, let's take example1:\n\nAnti-diagonal sum 1 includes (0,1) and (1,0). Both have 2. So if we collect elements from each anti-diagonal in order of increasing sum, and within each sum, ordered from top to bottom (i increases), then for sum 1: (0,1) comes first, then (1,0). Both are 2s. So the elements would be [2,2]. Then sum 3 includes (2,1) which is 2. So the output would be [2,2,2], which matches example1's output. That seems to fit.\n\nLet's test this with example0.\n\nExample0:\n\nAnti-diagonals with non-zero elements:\n\nSum 1: (0,1) is 0, (1,0) is 1. Wait, no. Wait in example0, the non-zero elements are (1,0) and (2,1). Let's check their sum:\n\n(1,0): sum 1 \u2192 anti-diagonal sum 1.\n\n(2,1): sum 3 \u2192 anti-diagonal sum 3.\n\nIn example0's input:\n\nRow 1 has [1,0,0] \u2192 (1,0) is 1. Sum 1.\n\nRow 2 has [0,1,0] \u2192 (2,1) is 1. Sum 3.\n\nSo anti-diagonal sum 1: elements (0,1) and (1,0). But (0,1) is 0, (1,0) is 1. So non-zero here is 1. Then sum 3 has (1,2) and (2,1). (2,1) is 1, others in sum 3 are 0. So elements in sum 1: [0,1], but the non-zero is 1. Then sum 3: [0,1]. So non-zero elements are 1 and 1. Wait, but according to the output of example0, it's [1,1]. So if we collect all non-zero elements along each anti-diagonal in order of sum, then for each sum, list the non-zero elements. But how? For example0:\n\nsum 1: the elements are 0 (from (0,1)) and 1 (from (1,0)). So non-zero here is 1. So the output for sum 1 would be [1]. Then sum 3: elements are 0 (from (1,2)) and 1 (from (2,1)). So non-zero here is 1. So output is [1,1], which matches example0's output.\n\nIn example1, sum 1 has two 2s (from (0,1) and (1,0)), sum3 has a 2 (from (2,1)), so output is [2,2,2].\n\nExample2 input:\n\n[0,7,0]\n[0,0,0]\n[0,0,0]\n\nNon-zero element is (0,1) which has value 7. The sum here is 0+1=1. So anti-diagonal sum1. The elements in sum1 are (0,1) and (1,0). But in the input, (1,0) is 0. So the non-zero elements are [7], which gives output [7], which matches example2's output.\n\nExample3 input:\n\n[0,8,0]\n[8,8,0]\n[8,0,0]\n\nNon-zero elements:\n\n(0,1) \u21928 (sum 1)\n\nRow1: (1,0)=8, (1,1)=8 \u2192 sum for (1,0)=1+0=1; (1,1)=2.\n\nRow2: (2,0)=8 \u2192 sum 2+0=2.\n\nSo let's list all non-zero elements with their sum:\n\n(0,1) sum1: 8.\n\n(1,0) sum1:8.\n\n(1,1) sum2:8.\n\n(2,0) sum2:8.\n\nSo anti-diagonal sum1 includes (0,1) and (1,0) \u2192 8,8.\n\nSum2 includes (0,2) (0 in input), (1,1) (8), (2,0) (8). So non-zero are 8 and 8.\n\nSum3 includes (1,2) (0), (2,1) (0).\n\nSo the output would collect non-zero elements in order of sum1, sum2. For sum1: 8,8. Sum2:8,8. So the output is [8,8,8,8], which matches example3's output.\n\nSo the pattern seems to be:\n\n- For each anti-diagonal (grouped by i+j sum), collect all non-zero elements in the order of the anti-diagonal sum (starting from sum 0 to sum max), and within each anti-diagonal, list the elements from top to bottom (i.e., higher row indices first? Or lower? Let's see in example3. For sum1: elements (0,1) and (1,0). In the output for sum1, it's 8,8. The input (0,1) is 8, (1,0) is 8. So in the output, they are ordered as 8 (from (0,1)) and 8 (from (1,0))? Or the other way around?\n\nWait, in example1, sum1 has (0,1) and (1,0), both 2. The output is [2,2]. So in example3's sum1, the elements are (0,1)=8 and (1,0)=8. So their order in output is 8,8. Which suggests that within the same sum, the elements are ordered from top to bottom. For sum1, (0,1) is in row 0, then (1,0) is row1. So maybe the order is from higher row to lower? Because in (0,1) comes before (1,0) in the anti-diagonal sum1. Let's check.\n\nAnti-diagonal for sum1: (0,1), (1,0). If we list them in the order they appear as we move down the anti-diagonal. For example, starting from (0,1) then moving to (1,0). So for sum1, the elements are ordered from top to bottom. So (0,1) is first, then (1,0). So in example1, the elements are [2 (from (0,1)), 2 (from (1,0))]. So the output for sum1 is [2,2], which is the first two elements of example1's output. Then sum3 has (2,1) \u2192 2, so output is [2,2,2].\n\nIn example3's sum1, elements are (0,1)=8 and (1,0)=8 \u2192 ordered as 8,8. Sum2 has (0,2)=0, (1,1)=8, (2,0)=8. The non-zero are (1,1) and (2,0). So for sum2, the order would be (0,2) first, then (1,1), then (2,0). But (0,2) is zero, so we skip. Then (1,1)=8, (2,0)=8. So the elements in sum2 would be 8 and 8, added to the output. So the output is [8,8,8,8], which is correct.\n\nSo the pattern is: for each anti-diagonal (i+j = s for s starting from 0 upwards), collect the non-zero elements in the order they appear along the anti-diagonal (from top-right to bottom-left?), but within each diagonal, the elements are ordered from higher column index to lower. Wait, maybe the order is from top to bottom. For example, in sum1, (0,1) is first, then (1,0). So when moving along the anti-diagonal, you start from the top row and go down. So for sum s, the elements are in order of increasing row index (i) from 0 upwards. Wait, no. Because for sum s, the possible i's go from max(0, s - (cols-1)) to min(rows-1, s). But perhaps the order is i increasing. For sum1 in a 3x3 matrix: i can be 0 or 1. So (0,1) and (1,0). So in order, (0,1) comes first, then (1,0). So the elements are added in that order.\n\nThus, the pattern is:\n\n1. For each anti-diagonal (i+j = s), where s ranges from 0 to (rows+cols-2).\n\n2. For each s, traverse the anti-diagonal from i=0 to i=rows-1 (as long as j is within bounds).\n\n3. Collect all non-zero elements in the order of traversal.\n\n4. Concatenate all these non-zero elements across all s to form the output list.\n\nNow applying this to the test input:\n\nTest input:\n\n[4,4,0]\n[4,0,4]\n[0,0,4]\n\nLet's list all non-zero elements:\n\nRow0: [4 (0,0),4 (0,1),0]\n\nRow1: [4 (1,0),0,4 (1,2)]\n\nRow2: [0,0,4 (2,2)]\n\nNon-zero elements:\n\n(0,0)=4 \u2192 sum 0+0=0.\n\n(0,1)=4 \u2192 sum 0+1=1.\n\n(1,0)=4 \u2192 sum 1+0=1.\n\n(1,2)=4 \u2192 sum 1+2=3.\n\n(2,2)=4 \u2192 sum 2+2=4.\n\nNow group by sum:\n\nsum0: (0,0) \u21924.\n\nsum1: (0,1)=4, (1,0)=4 \u2192 sum1.\n\nsum2: (0,2) (0 in input), (1,1) (0), (2,0) (0) \u2192 all zeros.\n\nsum3: (1,2)=4, (2,1) (0) \u2192 only 4.\n\nsum4: (2,2)=4.\n\nSo non-zero elements:\n\nsum0: 4.\n\nsum1: 4,4.\n\nsum3:4.\n\nsum4:4.\n\nSo the order is sum0, sum1, sum2, sum3, sum4. But sum2 has no non-zero, so it's skipped. So the output should be [4 (sum0), 4,4 (sum1),4 (sum3),4 (sum4)].\n\nWait, but in the test input, the elements in sum3 are (1,2) and (2,1). (1,2)=4, (2,1)=0. So sum3 has 4.\n\nsum4 is (2,2)=4.\n\nSo the output would be the concatenation of the non-zero elements from sum0, sum1, sum3, sum4.\n\nsum0: [4]\n\nsum1: [4 (from (0,1)),4 (from (1,0))]\n\nsum3: [4 (from (1,2))]\n\nsum4: [4 (from (2,2))]\n\nSo concatenated: [4,4,4,4,4]. But wait, the test input's output would be [4,4,4,4,4]. But let's check the examples again.\n\nWait, example3's output is [8,8,8,8], which comes from sum1 (8,8) and sum2 (8,8), but sum0 has 0 and sum3 has 0. So in that case, the output is all non-zero elements in order of sum. So the test input's output should be [4,4,4,4,4]. But let's check if that's correct.\n\nBut looking at the test input:\n\nThe anti-diagonals with non-zero elements are sum0, sum1, sum3, sum4.\n\nsum0: 4.\n\nsum1:4,4.\n\nsum3:4.\n\nsum4:4.\n\nSo the output is [4,4,4,4,4]. But looking at the training examples, for example1, which had three elements in sum1 (two) and sum3 (one), the output is [2,2,2]. Similarly, example3's sum1 and sum2 contribute four elements. So applying the same logic here, the test input's output should be [4,4,4,4,4].\n\nBut wait, in the test input's sum1, we have (0,1) and (1,0) both 4. Then sum3 has (1,2) as 4. sum4 has (2,2) as 4. sum0 has (0,0) as4.\n\nSo the output would be [4 (sum0), 4,4 (sum1),4 (sum3),4 (sum4)] \u2192 [4,4,4,4,4]. But let me check the test input's layout:\n\nRows:\n\nRow0: [4,4,0]\n\nRow1: [4,0,4]\n\nRow2: [0,0,4]\n\nNow, let's list the anti-diagonals and their elements:\n\nsum0: i+j=0 \u2192 (0,0) \u21924.\n\nsum1: i+j=1 \u2192 (0,1)=4, (1,0)=4 \u2192 [4,4].\n\nsum2: i+j=2 \u2192 (0,2)=0, (1,1)=0, (2,0)=0 \u2192 all zeros, nothing added.\n\nsum3: i+j=3 \u2192 (1,2)=4, (2,1)=0 \u2192 [4].\n\nsum4: i+j=4 \u2192 (2,2)=4 \u2192 [4].\n\nSo the output is [4,4,4,4,4].\n\nBut looking at the examples, the output is given as lists. For example, example3's output is [8,8,8,8], which matches the non-zero elements in sum1 and sum2. So the test input's output should be [4,4,4,4,4]. However, I need to verify if there's any pattern that may have been overlooked.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the sum is calculated differently. For example, maybe it's i - j. Let's check if that's possible.\n\nBut in example0, the non-zero elements are (1,0) \u2192 i-j=1, and (2,1) \u2192 i-j=1. If we group by i-j, the sums would be 1 and 1. Then output would be [1,1], which matches. For example1:\n\nNon-zero elements: (0,1) \u2192-1, (1,0)\u21921, (2,1)\u21921. If grouped by i-j, but that would split them into different groups, but the output is [2,2,2], which would not fit. So that's unlikely.\n\nSo returning to the initial approach, the pattern seems to be collecting non-zero elements along anti-diagonals (i+j = s), ordered by s, and within each s, ordered by increasing i. So the test input's output is [4,4,4,4,4]. But let me check the examples again to see if there's any other possible pattern.\n\nAnother thought: perhaps the output lists the elements in each diagonal in the order of the diagonals, but ignoring zeros. So for each diagonal in order of s from 0 upwards, collect all non-zero elements. That's what I think.\n\nIn that case, the test input's output would be [4,4,4,4,4]. But perhaps the answer is shorter. Let me look for any other possible patterns.\n\nWait, example0's output is [1,1], which corresponds to the two non-zero elements. Example1's output has three 2s, which is three non-zero elements. Example2's output is one 7, which is one non-zero. Example3's output is four 8s, which matches the four non-zero elements. So perhaps the output is just a list of all non-zero elements ordered according to their anti-diagonal sum and their position within the diagonal.\n\nSo yes, the test input has five non-zero elements (4,4,4,4,4), so the output should be [4,4,4,4,4].\n\nBut looking at the examples, example1's input has three non-zero elements (three 2s) and the output is three 2s. Example3's input has four 8s and the output is four 8s. So yes, the output is all non-zero elements ordered according to their anti-diagonal sum (s) and within each sum, ordered by increasing i. So the test input's output is [4,4,4,4,4]. However, let's look again at the test input's structure.\n\nWait, the test input is:\n\nRow0: [4,4,0]\n\nRow1: [4,0,4]\n\nRow2: [0,0,4]\n\nNon-zero elements:\n\n(0,0) \u2192 s=0 \u2192 4.\n\n(0,1) \u2192 s=1 \u21924.\n\n(1,0) \u2192 s=1 \u21924.\n\n(1,2) \u2192s=3 \u21924.\n\n(2,2) \u2192s=4 \u21924.\n\nSo the order is s=0, s=1, s=3, s=4.\n\nWithin s=1: (0,1) and (1,0), ordered as per i increasing. So (0,1) comes first, then (1,0). So elements are 4,4. Then s=3 has (1,2), s=4 has (2,2).\n\nSo the output should be [4,4,4,4,4], which is five elements.\n\nBut let me check the test input's rows again. Row0: [4,4,0]. Row1: [4,0,4]. Row2: [0,0,4].\n\nYes, that's correct. So the output should be [4,4,4,4,4]. But I need to make sure that in example3, the sum2 elements are included. Let me check example3 again.\n\nExample3's input:\n\nRow0: [0,8,0]\n\nRow1: [8,8,0]\n\nRow2: [8,0,0]\n\nNon-zero elements:\n\nRow0: (0,1)=8 \u2192 s=1.\n\nRow1: (1,0)=8 \u2192 s=1; (1,1)=8 \u2192 s=2.\n\nRow2: (2,0)=8 \u2192 s=2.\n\nSo s=1: (0,1)=8, (1,0)=8 \u2192 order 8,8.\n\ns=2: (1,1)=8, (2,0)=8 \u2192 ordered as (0,2) (0), (1,1) (8), (2,0) (8) \u2192 but (0,2) is 0, so non-zero are 8 and 8. So their order is 8,8.\n\nSo the output is s=1's elements first, then s=2's elements \u2192 [8,8,8,8], which is four elements. Correct.\n\nSo applying this to the test input, the output should be [4,4,4,4,4].",

Each row has three elements. The output seems to be the non-zero elements from the input, but not sure. Let's check the positions. The first row is all zeros. Second row has 1 at position 0. Third row has 1 at position 1. The output is two 1s. Maybe it's counting the non-zero values?

So non-zero elements are three 2s. The output is three 2s. So maybe the output is all the non-zero elements from the input, listed in order. But wait, in Example 0, there are two 1s. The input has a 1 in row 2, column 0, and row 3, column 1. So non-zero elements are 1 and 1. The output is [1,1], which matches. Example 2: input has a 7 in row 0, column 1. Output is [7]. That fits. Example 3: input has 8 in row 0 column 1, row 1 column 0, row1 column1, row2 column0. So four 8s. Output is [8,8,8,8]. So yes, the pattern seems to collect all non-zero elements from the input arrays, in the order they appear row-wise, left to right, and then concatenate them into the output list.\n\nLet me verify with Example 3. The rows are [0,8,0], [8,8,0], [8,0,0]. Scanning each row from left to right:\n\nFirst row: 0,8,0 \u2192 8\nSecond row:8,8,0 \u2192 8,8\nThird row:8,0,0 \u21928\nSo combined: 8,8,8,8. Which matches the output.\n\nSo the rule is: take all non-zero elements from each row, in order, left to right, and concatenate them into a list. The output is the list of all non-zero elements in order of their occurrence.\n\nApplying this to the test input:\n\nTest input:\n[4,4,0]\n[4,0,4]\n[0,0,4]\n\nFirst row: 4,4 \u2192 [4,4]\nSecond row:4,0,4 \u21924 and 4 \u2192 [4,4]\nThird row:0,0,4 \u21924 \u2192 [4]\nSo combining all non-zero elements: 4,4,4,4,4 \u2192 [4,4,4,4,4]\n\nWait, but let's check each row step by step.\n\nRow 1: [4,4,0] \u2192 non-zero are 4 and 4 \u2192 add to list.\nRow 2: [4,0,4] \u2192 4, then 4 \u2192 add two 4s.\nRow3: [0,0,4] \u2192 4 \u2192 add one 4.\n\nTotal elements: 2 + 2 +1 =5. So output should be [4,4,4,4,4].\n\nBut let me check if there's any other possible pattern. For instance, maybe summing rows or columns. But Example0's output is [1,1], which would be the sum of each column (1+0=1, 0+1=1, 0+0=0), then take non-zero sums? Wait, in Example0:\n\nOriginal input is three rows:\n\nRow0: 0,0,0 \u2192 sum columns? Sum each column: first column is 0+1+0=1, second column 0+0+1=1, third 0. So output [1,1], which matches. Oh, this is a different possible pattern. Let me check if that's the case.\n\nExample1:\n\nColumns are:\n\nFirst column: 0 + 2 +0 =2\n\nSecond column:2 +0 +2=4\n\nThird column:0+0+0=0\n\nBut output is [2,2,2], not [2,4]. So that doesn't fit. So maybe not column sums.\n\nWait, Example1's output is [2,2,2]. The non-zero elements in the input are three 2s. If it's non-zero elements collected, then that's the output. But column sums would have given 2,4,0. So the initial thought of collecting non-zero elements seems correct.\n\nAnother example: Example3's input has four 8s. Output is four 8s. So yes, the pattern is collecting all non-zero elements in row-wise, left-to-right order.\n\nSo for the test input:\n\nEach row:\n\nFirst row: 4,4,0 \u2192 4,4 \u2192 add to output.\n\nSecond row:4,0,4 \u21924,4 \u2192 add.\n\nThird row:0,0,4 \u21924 \u2192 add.\n\nTotal output: [4,4,4,4,4]. So five 4s.\n\nBut let me check again the training examples. Example3's input has four 8s, output has four 8s. So same logic. So the test input's output should be a list with five 4s. So the answer is [4,4,4,4,4]."
