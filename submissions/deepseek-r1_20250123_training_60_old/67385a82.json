        "cot_1": "Okay, let's tackle this puzzle. So, the task is to figure out the pattern that transforms the input matrices into the output ones. Let's look at the examples carefully.\n\nStarting with Example 0. The input is a 3x3 matrix. The output has some 8s. Let me see where the 8s are. In the first row, the first two 3s became 8s. The third element was 0 and stayed 0. The second row starts with 0, then 3 becomes 8. The third row starts with 3, but in the output it's still 3. Hmm. Wait, maybe there's a direction involved here. Like, maybe the 3s that are adjacent to certain elements get changed to 8s.\n\nLooking at Example 1's input and output. The first row's second element is 3, which becomes 8. The second row has three 3s that all turn into 8s. The third row's 3 stays 3. The fourth row's 3 remains. So maybe it's about the position of the 3s relative to others. Perhaps 3s that are part of a contiguous block (like connected horizontally or vertically) get replaced with 8s, but only if they are in certain positions?\n\nWait, maybe it's something else. Let's check Example 2. The input has various 3s. The output changes some to 8s. For example, in the first row, the first two 3s become 8s, the third is 0, and the fourth stays 3. The third row's first 3 becomes 8, and the last becomes 8. The fourth row's last two 3s become 8s. Hmm. So perhaps the rule is that any 3 that is in the same row and is to the left of a 0 (or maybe between 3s and 0s) gets changed. Not sure yet.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's about the number of adjacent 3s. Let's take Example 0. The first row [3,3,0]. Each 3 is adjacent to another 3. So maybe if a 3 has at least one adjacent 3 (horizontally or vertically), it becomes 8. Let's check. In Example 0's third row [3,0,3], the first and third elements are 3s. Are they adjacent? The first is adjacent to 0, but not another 3. So in the output, they remain 3. So that would fit. But in Example 1, the first row's 3 (second element) is adjacent to 3s in the next row (since the row below has 3s). Wait, maybe vertical adjacency counts too. Let's see.\n\nIn Example 1's input, the second row has [0,3,3,3,0,0]. All three 3s are adjacent to each other (horizontally), so they become 8s. The first row's 3 (element 1) is next to the second row's 3, so maybe that's why it becomes 8. But in the fourth row, the 3 is alone (element 1), so it remains 3. So maybe a 3 is turned into 8 if it has at least one adjacent 3 (including diagonally?), but perhaps not. Wait, in Example 0's first row, the two 3s are adjacent, so they become 8s. The third row's 3s are not adjacent (they are separated by 0s), so they stay 3. That makes sense. So the pattern is: any 3 that is part of a connected group (horizontally or vertically adjacent) is replaced with 8. But wait, in Example 2's third row input is [3,0,0,3], output is [8,0,0,8]. The 3s are not adjacent in the row, but maybe they are connected vertically. Let's check the surrounding rows. The row above is [3,3,0,0], which has 3s in the first two positions. So the first 3 in row 3 is below a 3 (row 2, first element is 3). Similarly, the last 3 in row 3 is in position 4. The row below (row 4) has 3s in positions 3 and 4. Wait, in the input of Example 2, the fourth row is [0,0,3,3]. So the third row's 3 in position 4 is adjacent to the fourth row's 3 in positions 3 and 4 (vertically). So maybe that 3 is connected via vertical adjacency. So in that case, the 3s in row 3 (positions 0 and 3) are connected to others via vertical adjacency. So they become 8s.\n\nSo the rule could be: replace all 3s that are part of a connected region (including vertically and horizontally adjacent) with 8s. But wait, in Example 1's first row, the 3 is in position 1. The row below (second row) has a 3 in position 1. So that's vertical adjacency. So that 3 in the first row becomes 8. But in Example 1's fourth row, the 3 is in position 1, but the row above (third row) has 0 in that position. So it's isolated, so it remains 3.\n\nSo the pattern seems to be that any 3 that is connected (via any direction) to at least one other 3 is replaced by 8. But wait, in Example 3's input:\n\nThe input is:\n\n[3,3,0,0,0,0]\n\n[0,3,0,0,3,0]\n\n[3,0,0,0,0,0]\n\n[0,3,3,0,0,0]\n\n[0,3,3,0,0,3]\n\nThe output is:\n\n[8,8,0,0,0,0]\n\n[0,8,0,0,3,0]\n\n[3,0,0,0,0,0]\n\n[0,8,8,0,0,0]\n\n[0,8,8,0,0,3]\n\nLooking at the second row's fifth element (3) in the input. It's in position 4. The output remains 3. So why is that? Let's check adjacency. The 3 in row 1, position 4. The row above (row 0) has 0s in that column. The row below (row 2) has 0. The same row, left is 0 (position 3), right is 0 (position5). So it's isolated. So no adjacent 3s. Hence, it remains 3. So the rule is correct.\n\nSo the transformation is: for each cell in the matrix, if the cell is 3 and is connected (via horizontal or vertical adjacency) to at least one other 3, replace it with 8. Otherwise, leave it as 3 or 0.\n\nWait, but in Example 2's output, the first row's last element is 3 (input was 3, output is 3). Let me check. The first row of input is [3,3,0,3]. Output is [8,8,0,3]. The last 3 in the first row. Why didn't it change? Let's see. In the first row, the 3s are at positions 0,1,3. Position 3 is adjacent to position 2 (0), so no. The next row (second row) is [3,3,0,0]. The 3 in position 0 and 1. The first row's 3 at position 3 is adjacent to the row below (second row's position 0? No, that's column 0. So row 0's position 3 is column 3. Row 1 (second row) has [3,3,0,0], so column 3 is 0. So the 3 at (0,3) is not adjacent to any other 3. Hence, it remains 3. So the rule holds: only 3s that are connected to others (vertically or horizontally) become 8s.\n\nSo the pattern is: for each cell, if the cell is 3 and is part of a connected region (connected via horizontal or vertical adjacency), then replace it with 8. Otherwise, leave it as is. So 3s that are isolated (no adjacent 3s) remain 3.\n\nNow, applying this to the test input.\n\nTest Input:\n\nRow 0: [3,0,3,0,3]\n\nRow 1: [3,3,3,0,0]\n\nRow 2: [0,0,0,0,3]\n\nRow 3: [0,3,3,0,0]\n\nRow 4: [0,3,3,0,0]\n\nLet's process each cell to see if they are connected to other 3s.\n\nStarting with row 0:\n\nIndex 0: 3. Check adjacent cells (left: none, right: 0, up: none, down: row 1, index 0 is 3). So adjacent 3. So becomes 8.\n\nIndex 1: 0. Stays 0.\n\nIndex 2: 3. Check adjacent. Left is 0, right is 0. Down is row 1, index 2 is 3. So connected. So becomes 8.\n\nIndex 3:0. Stays 0.\n\nIndex4:3. Check adjacent. Left is 0, right: none. Down is row1, index4 is 0. So no adjacent 3. So remains 3.\n\nSo row0 becomes [8,0,8,0,3]\n\nRow1:\n\nEach cell:\n\nIndex0:3. Adjacent: up (row0:8), left none. right:3 (index1). So connected. 8.\n\nIndex1:3. Adjacent to left (3), right (3). So 8.\n\nIndex2:3. Adjacent left (3), right (0). Down: row2, index2 is 0. Up: row0's index2 is 8. So connected. 8.\n\nIndex3:0. Stays 0.\n\nIndex4:0. Stays 0.\n\nSo row1 becomes [8,8,8,0,0]\n\nRow2:\n\nAll 0s except index4:3. Check adjacent. Up: row1 index4 is 0. Down: row3 index4 is 0. Left is 0. Right: none. So isolated 3. Remains 3.\n\nRow3:\n\nIndex0:0. Stays.\n\nIndex1:3. Check adjacent. Right is 3 (index2). Down: row4 index1 is3. Up: row2 index1 is0. So connected. 8.\n\nIndex2:3. Adjacent left (3), down (row4, index2 is3). So 8.\n\nOthers are 0. So row3 becomes [0,8,8,0,0]\n\nRow4:\n\nSame as row3. All 3s are connected. So becomes [0,8,8,0,0]\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nThe output should be:\n\n[8, 0, 8, 0, 3]\n\n[8, 8, 8, 0, 0]\n\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 3]\n\n[0, 8, 8, 0, 0]\n\n[0, 8, 8, 0, 0]\n\nWait, but let me double-check each cell to avoid mistakes.\n\nRow0, index0: connected to row1's 3 (now 8), so 8.\n\nRow0, index2: connected to row1's index2 (3, now 8). So yes, becomes 8.\n\nRow0, index4: no adjacent 3s. So remains 3.\n\nRow1: all 3s are connected to each other and to row0's 3s. So all become 8s.\n\nRow2, index4: 3, no adjacent 3s. Stays 3.\n\nRow3 and row4: 3s are connected in their rows and vertically (row3 and row4's 3s are in same columns). So all become 8s.\n\nYes, that matches.",

        "cot_2": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. So, looking at the training examples, the input is a 2D array of 3s, 0s, and maybe other numbers, and the output replaces some of the 3s with 8s. Hmm, the key is to determine which 3s get replaced and which stay.\n\nLooking at Example 0:\nInput has three rows. The first row is [3,3,0], which becomes [8,8,0]. The second row [0,3,0] becomes [0,8,0], and the third row stays the same. So maybe the rows that are modified are the ones that have 3s that are not in the last row. Wait, but in example 0, the third row isn't changed. Maybe there's something about the position of the 3s.\n\nIn Example 1, the output changes some 3s to 8s. Let's see. The first row input is [0,3,0,0,0,3], output becomes [0,8,0,0,0,3]. So the last element was a 3 and stayed. Similarly, the second row in input has four 3s, and in output, all but the last one (if any) are turned to 8. Wait, but in example 1's second row input is [0,3,3,3,0,0], which becomes [0,8,8,8,0,0]. All the 3s here are converted. Hmm. Wait, but in the first row of example 1's output, the last 3 remains. So maybe the 3s that are at the end of a row are kept, but others are converted to 8s? But in example 0's first row, both 3s are converted. Let me check.\n\nExample 0's input first row: [3,3,0]. The output is [8,8,0]. So both 3s become 8. The second row [0,3,0] becomes [0,8,0]. So again, the 3 is converted. The third row remains the same. So maybe the rule is that in each row, all 3s except those that are followed by a 3 in the same column in the row below are converted to 8. Wait, but how does that work? Let me think.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each 3 is replaced by 8 unless there's a 3 directly below it. Let's check example 0. The third row is [3,0,3]. The second row's third column is 0, so the first row's third column is 0. Wait, maybe not. Let's take the first example. Let's see example 1's first row. The last element is 3. In the output, it remains 3. Let's check the row below. The next row in the input is [0,3,3,3,0,0]. So the column for that last element (position 5, index 5?) in the first row, which is 3, and the row below's same column is 0. So if the cell below is not a 3, then it's replaced by 8. Wait, but in the first row of example 1, the 3 in the second column (index 1) is replaced by 8. The cell below (row 2, column 1) is 3, so according to that logic, it should not be replaced. But in the output, it was replaced. So that contradicts that idea.\n\nHmm, maybe another approach. Let's look at example 2. Input:\n\n[3,3,0,3]\n[3,3,0,0]\n[3,0,0,3]\n[0,0,3,3]\n\nOutput:\n\n[8,8,0,3]\n[8,8,0,0]\n[8,0,0,8]\n[0,0,8,8]\n\nSo the first row's last element is 3, and it remains 3 in the output. The row below (row 2) in that column (column 3) is 0. So maybe the 3 is kept if there's no 3 directly below it. Wait, but in the first row of example 2, the last element 3 is kept. The row below (row 2, column 3) is 0. So perhaps if the cell below is not a 3, the current cell's 3 is kept as 3? But in the first row's first two elements (3,3) are converted to 8. The row below (row 2, same columns) has 3s. Wait, row 2's first two elements are 3 and 3. So if the cell below is 3, then the current cell's 3 is replaced with 8? But in example 0, the first row's 3s are converted to 8s, and the second row's 3 is converted. The third row's 3s are left as is. So perhaps only the 3s that are not in the last row and are not followed by a 3 in the same column in the next row are converted to 8? Or maybe the opposite.\n\nWait, let's take example 0's first row. Each 3 in the first row. The row below (row 2) has 0,3,0. So for the first column in row 1, the cell below (row2, col0) is 0. So since the cell below is not a 3, the original cell (row1, col0) is 3, which is converted to 8. Then row2's 3 is in col1. The row below that (row3, col1) is 0. So row2's 3 is converted to 8. But row3's 3s are left as 3. So maybe the rule is: For each cell that is a 3, replace it with 8 if the cell directly below it is not a 3. Except for the last row, which can't have a cell below, so all 3s in the last row remain. Let's test this.\n\nIn example 0:\n\nRow 0: [3,3,0]. For each cell in row0, check row1 same column.\n\nRow0, col0: 3. row1, col0 is 0 (not 3), so replace with 8.\n\nRow0, col1:3. row1, col1 is 3 (so no replacement? But output shows 8. Wait, that contradicts. Because in example 0's output, row0 becomes [8,8,0]. So in this case, row0, col1's cell is 3. The cell below (row1, col1) is 3, so according to that hypothesis, it should remain 3. But in the output, it's 8. So that's a problem. So the hypothesis is incorrect.\n\nAlternative approach: Maybe the 3s are replaced with 8 except when they are in the same column as a 3 in the row below. Wait, in example 0, row0, col0:3, row1, col0 is 0. So replace with 8. row0, col1:3, row1, col1:3. So don't replace. But output shows it's 8. So that's not matching. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is that all 3s are replaced with 8 unless they are in the bottom row. Looking at example 0: the first two rows have their 3s replaced, the third row's 3s are kept. But in example 1, the third row's 3 is in the fifth column (input row3 is [0,3,0,0,0,0], but the output is [0,3,0,0,0,0]. Wait no, in example1's input, the third row is [0,0,0,0,3,0], which in the output is [0,0,0,0,3,0]. So the 3 in row2, column4 is kept. But according to the hypothesis, since it's not the last row, it should be replaced. But in output it's kept. So that's not right.\n\nAnother idea: Maybe the 3s are replaced with 8 except when they are in the same column as a 3 in the row above. Or maybe the other way around. Let's see.\n\nTake example2's first row: [3,3,0,3]. Output is [8,8,0,3]. The row below is [3,3,0,0]. So for the first two 3s in row0, the row below has 3s. So if the cell below is a 3, maybe the current cell is replaced. But in the output, the first two 3s are replaced. Hmm, this is confusing.\n\nWait, example2's input row3 is [0,0,3,3]. The output for that row is [0,0,8,8]. So all 3s in the last row are replaced. Which contradicts the previous idea that the last row's 3s are kept.\n\nWait, in example0's third row, which is the last row, [3,0,3] remains as [3,0,3] in the output. But in example2's last row, the 3s are replaced to 8. So that's conflicting. So that can't be the pattern.\n\nAlternative approach: Let's look for other patterns. Maybe the 3s are replaced with 8s except when they are the first occurrence in their column from the bottom. Wait, let's check example0.\n\nIn example0's columns:\n\nColumn0: 3 (row0), 0 (row1), 3 (row2). So the bottommost 3 is in row2. So all 3s above are replaced. So in row0, col0's 3 becomes 8. Row2's 3 remains. Similarly for column1: 3 (row0), 3 (row1), 0 (row2). The bottommost 3 is row1. So row0's 3 becomes 8. Row1's 3 becomes 8 (but output shows row1, col1 is 8 in example0). Wait, but the output for example0's row1 is [0,8,0]. So the 3 in row1, col1 is replaced with 8. But according to this hypothesis, only 3s above the bottommost in the column are replaced. So in column1, the bottommost 3 is row1. So row0's 3 would be replaced, row1's 3 would remain. But in the output, row1's 3 is replaced. So that's not matching.\n\nHmm, maybe the bottommost 3 in each column is kept as 3, and others are replaced. Let's check example0:\n\nColumn0: 3 (row0), 0 (row1), 3 (row2). The bottommost is row2. So row0's 3 is replaced, row2's stays. Output for row0, col0 is 8. Correct. Column1: 3 (row0), 3 (row1), 0 (row2). The bottommost is row1. So row0's 3 is replaced, row1's stays. But in the output, row1's 3 is replaced to 8. So that's conflicting.\n\nHmm. Let's try example1:\n\nInput row0: [0,3,0,0,0,3]. Output is [0,8,0,0,0,3].\n\nSo column1 in row0:3 becomes 8. Column5 in row0:3 remains. Let's check the bottommost 3s in columns.\n\nColumn1: input has row0:3, row1:3, row2:0, row3:3. So the bottommost is row3. So row0 and row1's 3s would be replaced. In output, row0's 3 is replaced (correct), row1's 3 is replaced (output row1 is [0,8,8,8,0,0]), so their 3s in column1 are replaced. But according to the hypothesis, only the bottommost (row3) is kept. So the others are replaced. But row3's column1 is 3 (input row3 is [0,3,0,0,0,0]), so in column1, the bottommost is row3. So all others are replaced. Which matches the output. For column5: input row0's column5 is 3. Other rows in column5: row1 has 0, row2 has 0, row3 has 0. So the bottommost is row0. So it should stay as 3. Which matches the output.\n\nSo this seems to fit. So the pattern is: for each column, replace all 3s with 8 except the bottommost 3 in the column, which remains as 3.\n\nLet me test this with example0:\n\nExample0's input is:\n\nRow0: [3,3,0]\nRow1: [0,3,0]\nRow2: [3,0,3]\n\nLooking at columns:\n\nColumn0: 3 (row0), 0 (row1), 3 (row2). The bottommost 3 is row2. So row0's 3 is replaced with 8. row2's remains. Output row0:8, row2:3. Correct.\n\nColumn1: 3 (row0),3 (row1),0 (row2). The bottommost 3 is row1. So row0's 3 becomes 8. row1's 3 is the bottommost and remains. But output row1's column1 is 8. Wait, that's a problem. So in example0's output, row1's column1 is 8, but according to this hypothesis, it should be 3. So this contradicts.\n\nWait, example0's output for row1 is [0,8,0], but according to the hypothesis, the bottommost 3 in column1 is row1's 3, so it should stay. But in the output, it's replaced. So the hypothesis is incorrect.\n\nHmm. Maybe the pattern is that for each column, replace all 3s except the topmost. Let's check.\n\nIn example0, column0: topmost 3 is row0. So all others are replaced. But row2's 3 is replaced? Wait, but in example0's output, row2's column0 is 3, not replaced. So that's not matching.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the pattern is to replace each 3 with 8 except when it's in the same row and column as a 3 in the previous row. Wait, no, that's unclear.\n\nAnother idea: Maybe the 3s are replaced with 8 unless they are part of a vertical chain from the bottom. Like, starting from the bottom, each 3 in a column that is connected upwards remains, and others are replaced. So for example, in a column, the bottommost 3 remains, and any 3 above it in the same column is replaced unless there's a 3 immediately above it. Wait, perhaps it's a vertical line of 3s from the bottom up. Let's see.\n\nTake example0's column0: row2 is 3, row0 is 3. But row1 is 0. So the bottommost is row2. Then, the next up would be row0. But since there's a 0 in row1, the chain is broken. So only row2's 3 is kept. So row0's 3 is replaced. Output row0 is 8. Correct. For column1 in example0: row0 and row1 have 3s, row2 has 0. The bottommost is row1. So row1's 3 is kept. row0's 3 is replaced. So output row1's column1 should be 3, but in the output it's 8. So that's conflicting. So this hypothesis is also incorrect.\n\nHmm. Let's look at example2's output:\n\nInput row0: [3,3,0,3] \u2192 output [8,8,0,3]\n\nRow1: [3,3,0,0] \u2192 [8,8,0,0]\n\nRow2: [3,0,0,3] \u2192 [8,0,0,8]\n\nRow3: [0,0,3,3] \u2192 [0,0,8,8]\n\nWait, in column0 of example2, the input has 3 in rows 0,1,2, and 0 in row3. So the bottommost 3 in column0 is row2. So all 3s above (row0 and 1) are replaced. So row0 and row1's 3s become 8. Output matches.\n\nColumn3: input has 3 in row0, and 3 in row2 and 3 in row3. So bottommost is row3. So row0 and row2's 3s are replaced. So in row0's column3 becomes 3? No, output row0's column3 is 3. Wait input row0's column3 is 3. The output is 3. So according to the previous hypothesis, since it's not the bottommost, it should be replaced. But it's not. Hmm. So that's conflicting.\n\nWait, example2's input column3:\n\nRow0:3\n\nRow1:0\n\nRow2:3\n\nRow3:3\n\nThe bottommost is row3. So rows0 and row2 would be replaced. But in the output, row0's column3 is 3, which is not replaced. That's a problem. So the hypothesis is wrong.\n\nAnother approach: Let's look at the examples and see where the 3s are replaced. For example, in example0, the output changes 3s in the first two rows to 8, but leaves the third row's 3s as is. In example1, the output changes some 3s in the first three rows but leaves some. In example2, even the last row's 3s are replaced. So perhaps the rule is different.\n\nWait, example2's last row is [0,0,3,3], which in the output becomes [0,0,8,8]. So the 3s are replaced even in the last row. So the previous idea that the last row's 3s are kept is incorrect.\n\nSo what's common in the replacement? Let's see:\n\nIn example0, all 3s except the last row's are replaced. Wait no: example0's third row has [3,0,3], which are kept as 3. But example2's last row's 3s are replaced. So that's a contradiction.\n\nAlternative idea: Maybe the 3s are replaced with 8 if they are in a cell that is not directly below another 3. Wait, not sure.\n\nAnother possibility: The transformation is replacing all 3s with 8s except those that are followed (to the right) by a 3. So in a row, a 3 is replaced unless the next element is also a 3. Let's check.\n\nExample0's first row: [3,3,0]. The first two 3s are consecutive, so they would be kept, but in the output they are replaced. So this idea is incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 3s are replaced except when they are in the same row as another 3 to their right. But in example0's row0, the two 3s are next to each other. So they would be kept, but output shows they are replaced. So no.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 3s are replaced with 8 unless they are part of a horizontal group. For example, a single 3 is replaced, but consecutive 3s are kept. But example0's first row has two 3s, but they are replaced. So that's not.\n\nHmm. Let's think differently. Maybe the 3s are replaced with 8 unless there's a 3 in the same position in the row below. Let's check example0's row0:\n\nRow0: [3,3,0]\n\nRow1: [0,3,0]\n\nRow0, col0:3. Row1, col0 is 0. So replaced with 8.\n\nRow0, col1:3. Row1, col1 is 3. So not replaced. But in output, it's replaced to 8. So this idea is wrong.\n\nAnother idea: Maybe the 3s are replaced with 8 if there's a 3 to the left of them in the same row. Or to the right. Not sure.\n\nWait, looking at example3's input and output. Example3's input has a row [0,3,3,0,0,0], which becomes [0,8,8,0,0,0]. So two 3s next to each other are replaced. So maybe that's not a factor.\n\nAlternative approach: Maybe the 3s are replaced with 8 if they are not the last 3 in their row. Like, in each row, the rightmost 3 remains as 3, others are replaced. Let's check example0's first row: [3,3,0]. The rightmost 3 is the second element (index1). So both are replaced. But in the output, both are replaced, so that doesn't fit.\n\nExample1's first row input is [0,3,0,0,0,3]. Output is [0,8,0,0,0,3]. The rightmost 3 is in the last position. So others are replaced. That fits. Example1's second row input is [0,3,3,3,0,0]. The rightmost 3 is at index3. So all three 3s would be replaced except the last one. But the output is [0,8,8,8,0,0], which suggests all are replaced. So that doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. So this approach is not correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 3s are replaced with 8 except when they are in the last occurrence in their row. So in example1's first row, the last 3 is kept. Other 3s in the row are replaced. Which matches the output. Example0's first row has two 3s, which are both replaced. Because the last occurrence is the second element, but in output both are replaced, which contradicts.\n\nWait, example0's first row: [3,3,0]. The last occurrence of 3 is at index1. So only that would remain. But output replaces both. So no.\n\nAnother approach: Let's look for the number of 8s in each example. For instance, in example0's output, the first two rows have 8s where there were 3s, except the third row. But example2's last row's 3s are replaced. So perhaps the pattern is that 3s are replaced with 8s unless they are the last in the row and there is a 3 in the row below. Or something like that.\n\nAlternatively, think of it as flipping the 3s to 8s, except those that are adjacent (in some direction) to another 3. But example0's first row has two adjacent 3s, which are replaced. So that's not.\n\nWait, maybe the rule is to replace every 3 with 8, except when the 3 is directly above another 3. Let's test this.\n\nExample0's first row, col0:3. The cell below (row1, col0) is 0. So replace with 8. Correct.\n\nRow0, col1:3. The cell below (row1, col1) is 3. So don't replace. But in output, it's replaced to 8. So this is conflicting.\n\nHmm. This is tricky. Let's try to find a different angle. Let's look at the test input and see if we can apply some pattern.\n\nTest Input:\n\n[3,0,3,0,3]\n[3,3,3,0,0]\n[0,0,0,0,3]\n[0,3,3,0,0]\n[0,3,3,0,0]\n\nIf the pattern is replacing all 3s with 8 except the bottommost in each column, then for each column, find the bottommost 3 and leave it as 3, others become 8.\n\nLet's see:\n\nColumn0:\n\nRows0:3\n\nRow1:3\n\nRow2:0\n\nRow3:0\n\nRow4:0\n\nBottommost 3 is row1. So row0's 3 becomes 8. row1's stays as 3.\n\nColumn1:\n\nRow0:0\n\nRow1:3\n\nRow2:0\n\nRow3:3\n\nRow4:3\n\nBottommost is row4. So row1,3,4's 3s. row1 and 3's 3s become 8. row4's stays.\n\nColumn2:\n\nRow0:3\n\nRow1:3\n\nRow2:0\n\nRow3:3\n\nRow4:3\n\nBottommost is row4. So row0,1,3's 3s become 8. row4's stays.\n\nColumn3:\n\nAll rows are 0, so no changes.\n\nColumn4:\n\nRow0:3\n\nRow1:0\n\nRow2:3\n\nRow3:0\n\nRow4:0\n\nBottommost 3 is row2. So row0's 3 becomes 8. row2's stays.\n\nSo applying this:\n\nRow0: [8,0,8,0,8]\n\nRow1: [3,8,8,0,0]\n\nRow2: [0,0,0,0,3]\n\nRow3: [0,8,8,0,0]\n\nRow4: [0,3,3,0,0]\n\nBut looking at the training examples, this might not be correct. For example, in example1's column5 (last column), the input row0 is 3, and in output it's kept as 3. The rows below have 0s, so the bottommost is row0, so it's kept. That aligns with this hypothesis.\n\nBut in example2's column3:\n\nRow0:3 (input), output is 3.\n\nRow2:3 (input), output is 8.\n\nRow3:3 (input), output is 8.\n\nSo according to the hypothesis, bottommost is row3. So row0 and row2's 3s become 8. But in the output, row0's 3 is kept as 3. So this is conflicting. Hmm. So the hypothesis is incorrect.\n\nWait, in example2's column3, the input has 3 in row0, 0 in row1, 3 in row2, 3 in row3. So bottommost is row3. So row0 and row2's 3s should be replaced. But in the output, row0's column3 is 3 (not replaced), which contradicts. So this suggests the hypothesis is wrong.\n\nSo back to the drawing board. Let's look for another pattern. Looking at example2's output again:\n\nInput row0: [3,3,0,3] \u2192 output [8,8,0,3]\n\nRow1: [3,3,0,0] \u2192 [8,8,0,0]\n\nRow2: [3,0,0,3] \u2192 [8,0,0,8]\n\nRow3: [0,0,3,3] \u2192 [0,0,8,8]\n\nSo in row0, the last element (3) remains. Row2's last element (3) becomes 8. Row3's elements (3,3) become 8,8. So perhaps the rule is that in each row, the rightmost 3 remains as 3, others are replaced with 8. Let's test this.\n\nExample0:\n\nRow0: [3,3,0]. Rightmost 3 is at index1. So replace index0's 3 with 8. Output is [8,3,0]. But example0's output is [8,8,0]. So this doesn't fit.\n\nExample1's first row: [0,3,0,0,0,3]. Rightmost 3 is index5. So other 3 (index1) is replaced. Output matches: [0,8,0,0,0,3].\n\nExample1's second row: [0,3,3,3,0,0]. Rightmost 3 is index3. So indices1,2,3's 3s should have indices1 and 2 replaced. But output is [0,8,8,8,0,0], which replaces all. So this doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. So this rule works for some examples but not others.\n\nAnother idea: Perhaps the pattern is that the 3s are replaced with 8s except when they are the first in their row. For example, in example0's row0, the first two elements are 3s and are replaced. But no, example1's row0 has a 3 in the second position which is replaced.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 3s are replaced with 8 unless they are in the first column. No, example0's first column's 3 is replaced.\n\nAlternatively, the 3s in even positions are replaced. Not likely.\n\nLet me look at example3's input and output. Example3's input:\n\n[3,3,0,0,0,0] \u2192 [8,8,0,0,0,0]\n\n[0,3,0,0,3,0] \u2192 [0,8,0,0,3,0]\n\n[3,0,0,0,0,0] \u2192 [3,0,0,0,0,0]\n\n[0,3,3,0,0,0] \u2192 [0,8,8,0,0,0]\n\n[0,3,3,0,0,3] \u2192 [0,8,8,0,0,3]\n\nSo in the third row, the first element is 3 and remains. But why? The row below (row4) has 0 in column0. So according to previous hypotheses, this 3 is not replaced. Maybe the rule is that a 3 is kept if there are no 3s below it in the same column.\n\nFor example3's row2, column0:3. The column0 below (row3, row4) are 0 and 0. So no 3s below. So this 3 is kept. In example3's output, row2's 3 is kept. Yes. \n\nIn example3's row0, column0:3. The column0 below has row1:0, row2:3, row3:0, row4:0. There is a 3 in row2. So this 3 is replaced. Output shows row0's column0 is 8. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, row0, column1:3. Below in column1: row1:3, row2:0, row3:3, row4:3. So there are 3s below. So replace this 3. Output is 8. Correct.\n\nRow1, column1:3. Below in column1: row2:0, row3:3, row4:3. So there are 3s below. Replace this 3. Output is 8.\n\nRow3, column1:3. Below in column1: row4:3. So replace this 3. Output is 8.\n\nRow4, column1:3. No rows below. So keep as 3. Output is 8. Wait, no. The output for row4's column1 is 8, but according to the hypothesis, since there are no rows below, the 3 should be kept. So this contradicts.\n\nAh, wait, row4 is the last row. So according to this hypothesis, any 3 in the last row should be kept because there are no rows below. But in example3's row4, column1 and 2 are 3s in the input. Output is 8,8. So this hypothesis is incorrect.\n\nHmm. This is challenging. Let's try to think of the pattern in example3's row4. The input is [0,3,3,0,0,3]. Output is [0,8,8,0,0,3]. The last element is 3, which is kept. The others are replaced. So the 3 in column5 is kept. Why? Because it's the last in the row? Or because there's no 3 below it. But it's the last row, so no rows below. So according to previous hypothesis, it should be kept. The other 3s in the row (columns1 and2) are replaced. So why?\n\nAh, maybe the rule is: replace all 3s with 8, except those that are the last in their row and there are no 3s below them. Or perhaps only the last 3 in the entire matrix in each column is kept.\n\nAlternatively, in example3's row4, the 3 in column5 is kept because it's the only 3 in that column. Let's check:\n\nColumn5 in example3's input:\n\nRow0:0\n\nRow1:0\n\nRow2:0\n\nRow3:0\n\nRow4:3\n\nSo the bottommost 3 in column5 is row4. So according to the bottommost hypothesis, it's kept. But the output shows it's kept. The other 3s in row4 (columns1 and2) are replaced. Let's check their columns.\n\nColumn1 in example3's input:\n\nRow0:3\n\nRow1:3\n\nRow2:0\n\nRow3:3\n\nRow4:3\n\nBottommost is row4. So all 3s above are replaced. So row4's 3s are kept. But in the output, row4's columns1 and2 are 8. So this contradicts.\n\nWait, this is really confusing. Let's try to think again.\n\nLooking at example3's output row4: [0,8,8,0,0,3]. The input was [0,3,3,0,0,3]. So the first two 3s are replaced, but the last remains. So why is the last 3 kept?\n\nIn example3's column5:\n\nRow0:0, row1:0, row2:0, row3:0, row4:3. So bottommost is row4. So according to the bottommost hypothesis, it's kept. So output is 3. Which matches.\n\nFor column1 in example3's row4, the input is 3. The bottommost in column1 is row4. So it should be kept, but in the output it's replaced. So this hypothesis is incorrect.\n\nHmm. Maybe the rule is that any 3 that is the only 3 in its column is kept. But in example3's column5, there's only one 3, kept. In row4's column1, there are multiple 3s in the column, so they are replaced. But example0's column0 has two 3s and one is kept (row2's), others replaced. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule is to replace all 3s except those that are in the same column as a 3 in the next row. Wait, let's see.\n\nFor example0's row0, column0:3. The next row (row1) has 0. So no 3 in next row. So replaced. Correct.\n\nRow0, column1:3. Next row has 3. So not replaced. But in output, it is replaced. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAnother idea: Maybe the 3s are replaced unless there's a 3 in the same column in the previous row. For example, a 3 is kept if the row above it in the same column is also a 3. Let's check.\n\nExample0's row1, column1:3. The row above (row0) has 3. So kept. But output is 8. So incorrect.\n\nThis is really challenging. Let's look for any other possible pattern.\n\nWait, perhaps the 3s are replaced with 8 unless they are in a certain position relative to 0s. For example, if a 3 is followed by a 0 in the same row, then it's replaced. But example0's row0 has [3,3,0], and both 3s are replaced.\n\nAnother possibility: The transformation is to replace all 3s with 8, except when the cell to the right is also a 3. Let's check example2's first row: [3,3,0,3]. The first two 3s are adjacent, so they are replaced. But the fourth 3 is alone, so replaced. But in the output, the fourth 3 remains. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, replace all 3s except those that are the last in the row. In example1's first row, the last 3 is kept. In example2's first row, the last 3 is kept. Example3's row4's last 3 is kept. This seems to be a pattern. Let's check:\n\nExample0's first row: [3,3,0]. Last 3 is at index1. So both are replaced. So output would have 3 at index1. But the output is [8,8,0]. So this is conflicting.\n\nExample2's row2: [3,0,0,3]. The last 3 is replaced to 8. So this contradicts.\n\nHmm. But example1's first row has the last 3 kept. Example3's row4's last 3 is kept. But example2's first row's last 3 is kept. So perhaps this is part of the rule. But other examples don't fit.\n\nAlternative approach: Let's look for the difference between input and output in each cell.\n\nIn example0, every 3 except those in the last row are replaced with 8. But example2's last row has 3s replaced. So not.\n\nIn example1, the last 3 in the first row is kept. The other 3s in that row are replaced. The second row's 3s are all replaced. The third row's 3 is kept. The fourth row's 3s are kept. Hmm.\n\nIn example2's last row, all 3s are replaced. But example3's last row's last 3 is kept.\n\nAnother possible pattern: If a 3 is followed by a 0 in its row, replace it with 8. If it's followed by a non-zero, keep it. But examples have varying results.\n\nAlternatively, think of it as replacing all 3s with 8 except those that are part of the rightmost contiguous block of 3s in their row. For example:\n\nExample1's first row: the rightmost block is the last element, so it's kept. Others are replaced. Example2's first row: the rightmost block is the fourth element, so it's kept. But output shows it's kept. In example3's row4: the rightmost block is the last element, which is kept. The other 3s are replaced. This fits. Let's test other examples.\n\nExample0's first row: [3,3,0]. The rightmost block is the first two elements. But in output, both are replaced. So this doesn't fit.\n\nExample2's first row: input is [3,3,0,3]. The rightmost block is the fourth element. So it's kept. Output is [8,8,0,3], which fits. The other 3s are replaced.\n\nExample2's third row input is [3,0,0,3]. The rightmost block is the fourth element. So it's kept. But output is [8,0,0,8], which replaces it. So this contradicts.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternative idea: Perhaps the rule is to replace all 3s with 8 except those that are in the last occurrence of a 3 in their row and there are no 3s to the right of them. Let's see.\n\nIn example1's first row: last 3 is at position5. No 3s to the right. So kept. Others replaced. Correct.\n\nExample2's first row: last 3 is at position3. Kept. Others replaced. Correct.\n\nExample3's row4: last 3 is at position5. Kept. Others replaced. Correct.\n\nExample0's first row: last 3 is at position1. So it's kept. But output replaces it. So this hypothesis is incorrect.\n\nBut in example0's output, the last 3 in row0 is replaced. So this rule doesn't hold.\n\nThis is really tough. Let's try to think of another approach. Perhaps the pattern is that the first occurrence of 3 in each row is replaced, and others are kept. No, example1's first row has two 3s, both replaced except the last.\n\nAnother thought: The 3s are replaced with 8 if they are not the only 3 in their row. For example, if a row has multiple 3s, all are replaced except the last one. If a row has a single 3, it's kept.\n\nExample1's first row has two 3s. Only the last is kept. Example2's first row has three 3s, only the last is kept. Example3's row4 has three 3s, only the last is kept. This seems to fit.\n\nTesting example0's first row has two 3s. Both are replaced. So this contradicts.\n\nHmm. But example0's first row's output replaces both 3s to 8. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternative idea: If a row has more than one 3, replace all but the last with 8. If a row has one 3, keep it as 3. Let's see.\n\nExample1's first row has two 3s: replace all but last. Output is [0,8,0,0,0,3]. Correct.\n\nExample2's first row: three 3s \u2192 replace first two. Output is [8,8,0,3]. Correct.\n\nExample3's row4: three 3s \u2192 replace first two. Output is [0,8,8,0,0,3]. Correct.\n\nExample0's first row: two 3s \u2192 replace first, keep last. But output is [8,8,0], which replaces both. So this contradicts.\n\nSo this pattern works for some examples but not example0.\n\nBut why example0's first row is replaced both 3s? What's different in example0's first row? The row has [3,3,0]. The output is [8,8,0]. So according to this hypothesis, the last 3 should remain. But in output, both are replaced. So what's different here?\n\nLooking back, maybe example0's first row is part of a column where the 3s below are present. But in example0's column0: row0 is 3, row1 is 0, row2 is 3. So the last 3 in the column is row2, so row0's 3 is replaced. But how does that affect the row's processing?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule is a combination of row and column factors.\n\nAnother approach: Let's look for cells that are 3 and the cell to the right is also 3. If so, replace. But example0's first row has two 3s next to each other. They are replaced. So that's not.\n\nAlternatively, cells that are 3 and have a 3 to their right are replaced. Example0's first row, both 3s have a 3 to the right (except the last one). But both are replaced, so that's not.\n\nThis is really challenging. Let's try to look for a pattern that works across all examples.\n\nLet's list all the 3s in the inputs and see if they are replaced or not:\n\nExample0:\n\nRow0: [3,3,0] \u2192 [8,8,0] (both replaced)\n\nRow1: [0,3,0] \u2192 [0,8,0] (replaced)\n\nRow2: [3,0,3] \u2192 [3,0,3] (not replaced)\n\nExample1:\n\nRow0: [0,3,0,0,0,3] \u2192 [0,8,0,0,0,3] (first replaced, last kept)\n\nRow1: [0,3,3,3,0,0] \u2192 [0,8,8,8,0,0] (all replaced)\n\nRow2: [0,0,0,0,3,0] \u2192 [0,0,0,0,3,0] (kept)\n\nRow3: [0,3,0,0,0,0] \u2192 [0,3,0,0,0,0] (kept)\n\nExample2:\n\nRow0: [3,3,0,3] \u2192 [8,8,0,3] (first two replaced, last kept)\n\nRow1: [3,3,0,0] \u2192 [8,8,0,0] (both replaced)\n\nRow2: [3,0,0,3] \u2192 [8,0,0,8] (both replaced)\n\nRow3: [0,0,3,3] \u2192 [0,0,8,8] (both replaced)\n\nExample3:\n\nRow0: [3,3,0,0,0,0] \u2192 [8,8,0,0,0,0] (both replaced)\n\nRow1: [0,3,0,0,3,0] \u2192 [0,8,0,0,3,0] (first replaced, second kept)\n\nRow2: [3,0,0,0,0,0] \u2192 [3,0,0,0,0,0] (kept)\n\nRow3: [0,3,3,0,0,0] \u2192 [0,8,8,0,0,0] (both replaced)\n\nRow4: [0,3,3,0,0,3] \u2192 [0,8,8,0,0,3] (first two replaced, last kept)\n\nLooking at this, the only pattern I can see is that in a row, the last occurrence of 3 is kept if there are no 3s in the rows below that column. Otherwise, they are replaced. But how?\n\nAlternatively, if a 3 is in the last occurrence of its row and there are no 3s below it in the same column, it's kept. Otherwise, replaced.\n\nExample0's row0, last 3 is index1. In the same column (column1), row1 has 3 and row2 has 0. So there's a 3 below. So this 3 is replaced. Hence, both are replaced.\n\nExample1's row0, last 3 is index5. In column5, rows below are 0,0,0. So no 3s below. Hence, kept.\n\nExample1's row1, last 3 is index3. Column3 has row2:0, row3:0. So no 3s below. But why are all 3s in row1 replaced? Because their columns have 3s below?\n\nWait, example1's row1's 3s are in columns1,2,3. For column1: row3 has 3. So there's a 3 below. So the 3 in row1, column1 is replaced. Similarly for column2: row3 has 0. So no 3s below. But the 3 in row1, column2 is replaced. So this hypothesis doesn't fit.\n\nThis is getting too time-consuming. Given the time I have, I'll try to see if the pattern is that each 3 is replaced with 8 except the last 3 in each row, provided there are no 3s below it in the same column. Otherwise, replaced.\n\nTesting example0's row0: last 3 is index1. Column1 has row1:3 and row2:0. So there is a 3 below (row1). So replace. Hence, both 3s are replaced.\n\nExample1's row0: last 3 is index5. Column5 has no 3s below. So keep. Others replaced.\n\nExample1's row1: last 3 is index3. Column3 has no 3s below. So keep. But output shows all replaced. So this is conflicting.\n\nHmm. Maybe the correct pattern is that a 3 is replaced with 8 unless it is the last 3 in its row and there are no 3s in the same column below it.\n\nSo for each row, for each 3:\n\n- If it's the last 3 in the row and there are no 3s below it in its column, keep as 3.\n\n- Else, replace with 8.\n\nLet's test this.\n\nExample0's row0: last 3 is index1. Column1 has row1:3. So there is a 3 below. Hence, replace. So all 3s are replaced. Output matches.\n\nExample1's row0: last 3 is index5. Column5 has no 3s below. So keep. Others replaced. Correct.\n\nExample1's row1: last 3 is index3. Column3 has no 3s below. So keep. But output replaces it. So this hypothesis is incorrect.\n\nExample2's row0: last 3 is index3. Column3 has row1:0, row2:3, row3:3. So there are 3s below. Hence, replace. So all 3s in row0 are replaced. Output is [8,8,0,3]. Wait, the last 3 is kept. So this contradicts.\n\nThis is frustrating. Maybe the correct pattern is to replace all 3s with 8 except for those that are the first occurrence in their column from the bottom. So the bottommost 3 in each column remains 3, others are replaced.\n\nThis would explain:\n\nExample0's column0: bottommost 3 is row2. So row0's 3 is replaced.\n\nColumn1: bottommost 3 is row1. So row0's 3 is replaced.\n\nColumn2: no 3s except row2's, so it remains.\n\nThus, output for example0's row0: 8,8,0. Correct.\n\nRow1: column1's 3 is the bottommost, so kept. But output shows 8. So this is conflicting.\n\nAh, this is the key issue. In example0's row1, column1's 3 is the bottommost in the column (since row2 has 0). So according to this hypothesis, it should remain 3. But output shows 8. So this hypothesis is wrong.\n\nBut perhaps the bottommost 3 in each column is the lowest row where a 3 appears, and all 3s above are replaced.\n\nExample0's column0: bottommost is row2. So row0's 3 is replaced. Correct.\n\nColumn1: bottommost is row1. So row0's 3 is replaced. But row1's 3 should remain. But output shows it's replaced. So this is the problem.\n\nExample0's output for row1: [0,8,0]. But according to this hypothesis, it should be [0,3,0]. So this is not matching.\n\nBut why is example0's row1's 3 replaced? What's different about it?\n\nPerhaps the pattern is different. Maybe the 3s are replaced with 8 if they have any 3 below them in the same column, and kept otherwise.\n\nIn example0's row0, column0:3 has row2's 3 below. So replaced. Column1's 3 has row1's 3 below. So replaced. row1's 3 in column1 has no 3s below (row2's column1 is 0). So kept. But output shows it's replaced. So this is conflicting.\n\nAnother approach: Perhaps the 3s are replaced with 8 unless they are in the same row and column as a 3 in the next row. So for each cell (i,j), if cell (i+1,j) is 3, then keep it as 3. Else, replace with 8.\n\nExample0's row0, column0: cell below is 0 \u2192 replace to 8. Correct.\n\nRow0, column1: cell below is 3 \u2192 keep. But output is 8. So this is wrong.\n\nHmm. This is really challenging. Given the time I've spent and the lack of clear progress, I'll make an educated guess based on the examples that the pattern is to replace all 3s with 8 except those that are the last 3 in their row and have no 3s below them in their column.\n\nApplying this to the test input:\n\nTest Input:\n\nRow0: [3,0,3,0,3]\n\nRow1: [3,3,3,0,0]\n\nRow2: [0,0,0,0,3]\n\nRow3: [0,3,3,0,0]\n\nRow4: [0,3,3,0,0]\n\nFor each row, find the last 3 and check if there are any 3s below it in the same column. If not, keep it as 3, else replace with 8.\n\nRow0: last 3 is at index4 (value3). Check column4 below:\n\nRow1:0, row2:3, row3:0, row4:0. So there's a 3 in row2. So replace this 3. All 3s in row0 are replaced except if they are last and no 3s below.\n\nRow0's last 3 is at index4. But there is a 3 below (row2), so it's replaced. So all 3s in row0 become 8.\n\nRow1: last 3 is at index2. Check column2 below: row2:0, row3:3, row4:3. So there are 3s below. Replace this 3. All 3s in row1 are replaced.\n\nRow2: last 3 is at index4. No rows below. So keep as 3. Other 3s (none) are replaced.\n\nRow3: last 3 is at index2. Check column2 below (row4:3). So there is a 3 below. Replace. All 3s in row3 are replaced.\n\nRow4: last 3 is at index2. No rows below. So keep. But there are two 3s (indices1 and2). So last is index2. Check column2: no rows below. So keep. So replace earlier 3s.\n\nSo applying this:\n\nRow0: [8,0,8,0,8]\n\nRow1: [8,8,8,0,0]\n\nRow2: [0,0,0,0,3]\n\nRow3: [0,8,8,0,0]\n\nRow4: [0,8,3,0,0]\n\nBut looking at the training examples, this might not fit. For example, in example3's row4, the last 3 is kept. But according to this, row4's last 3 is at index5. Below, there's no rows. So it's kept. The others are replaced. Which matches example3's output.\n\nBut in the test input's row4, the last 3 is index2. So the 3 at index2 is kept, others replaced. So row4 becomes [0,8,3,0,0].\n\nBut looking at the training examples, when a row has multiple 3s, the last one is kept only if there are no 3s below.\n\nBut in the test row4, the last 3 is index2, and there's a row below (no, row4 is the last). So keep it. The other 3s in the row (index1) are replaced.\n\nSo the final output would be:\n\n[8,0,8,0,8]\n\n[8,8,8,0,0]\n\n[0,0,0,0,3]\n\n[0,8,8,0,0]\n\n[0,8,3,0,0]\n\nBut looking at the training examples, perhaps the output for row4 should have the last 3s replaced. Hmm, this is confusing.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is to replace all 3s with 8 except those that are the last in their row and there are no 3s below. So for the test input:\n\nRow0's last 3 is at index4. There is a 3 in row2, column4. So replace.\n\nRow1's last 3 is at index2. There are 3s in row3 and4. So replace.\n\nRow2's last 3 is at index4. No rows below. Keep.\n\nRow3's last 3 is at index2. There are 3s in row4. Replace.\n\nRow4's last 3 is at index2. No rows below. Keep.\n\nSo row4's 3s:\n\nInput: [0,3,3,0,0]\n\nLast 3 is index2. So it's kept. The 3 at index1 is replaced.\n\nThus, output for row4 is [0,8,3,0,0].\n\nBut looking at example3's row4, which has [0,3,3,0,0,3], output is [0,8,8,0,0,3]. The last 3 is kept, others replaced. So this fits.\n\nSo applying this pattern to the test input:\n\nFinal output would be:\n\n[8,0,8,0,8]\n\n[8,8,8,0,0]\n\n[0,0,0,0,3]\n\n[0,8,8,0,0]\n\n[0,8,3,0,0]\n\nBut I'm not entirely confident. Looking at example2's output, which replaces all 3s except the last in row0. But according to this, if there are 3s below, they are replaced. In example2's row0, last 3 is index3. Column3 has row2 and row3 with 3s. So replace. But output shows row0's last 3 is kept as 3. So this contradicts.\n\nHmm. So this approach is not correct. Given the time constraints, I'll proceed with the hypothesis that the pattern is to replace all 3s except the last in each row if there are no 3s below in that column. This seems to fit most examples except example0's row1.\n\nBut since the test input's output according to this would be:\n\nRow0: [8,0,8,0,8]\n\nRow1: [8,8,8,0,0]\n\nRow2: [0,0,0,0,3]\n\nRow3: [0,8,8,0,0]\n\nRow4: [0,8,3,0,0]\n\nBut in the training examples, like example3's row4, the last 3 is kept. So I'll go with this pattern."
