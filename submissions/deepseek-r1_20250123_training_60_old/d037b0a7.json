        "cot_1": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. So, looking at the training examples, I need to see how the input matrices are transformed into the output ones. Let's start with Example 0.\n\nInput for Example 0:\n[0, 0, 6]\n[0, 4, 0]\n[3, 0, 0]\n\nOutput:\n[0, 0, 6]\n[0, 4, 6]\n[3, 4, 6]\n\nHmm. Let's compare each row. The first row in the output is the same as the input. The second row: the first element is 0 (same as input), the second is 4 (same), and the third changed from 0 to 6. Where did that 6 come from? Looking up, the first row's third element is 6. So maybe it's taking the value from above. Then the third row in output is [3,4,6]. The third row's first element is 3 (same as input), the second is 4, which was in the second row's second element. The third is 6 again. So perhaps each cell is taking the maximum value from itself or the cell above it? Let me check.\n\nIn Example 0, the second row third column: input was 0, output is 6. The cell above (row 1, column 3) is 6. So maybe each cell is being replaced by the maximum of itself and the cell above it. Let's test this with other examples.\n\nExample 1 Input:\n[0, 2, 0]\n[7, 0, 8]\n[0, 0, 0]\n\nOutput:\n[0, 2, 0]\n[7, 2, 8]\n[7, 2, 8]\n\nFirst row remains same. Second row: 7 is same as input. Second element 0 becomes 2. That's the value from above (row1, column2). Third element 8 stays. Third row: first element becomes 7 (from above 7), second becomes 2 (from above 2), third becomes 8 (from above 8). So yes, seems like each cell is taking the maximum of itself and the cell above. Wait, but the first row is the same, so the rule starts from the second row onward. So for each cell (i,j), output[i][j] = max(input[i][j], output[i-1][j]). Because in example 0, second row third column becomes 6, which is from the first row. Then the third row third column is 6 again, but the input was 0. So maybe the output is built row by row, using the previous row's output as the basis.\n\nSo the process is: start with the first row as is. For each subsequent row, each element is the maximum between the current input value and the value from the same column in the previous row of the output.\n\nLet's check Example 2.\n\nInput Example 2:\n[4, 0, 0]\n[0, 2, 0]\n[0, 0, 0]\n\nOutput:\n[4,0,0]\n[4,2,0]\n[4,2,0]\n\nFirst row stays. Second row first element: max(0 and 4 from above) \u2192 4. Second element max(2 and 0 (previous output's second element of row1, which was 0?) Wait, input's second row second element is 2. So output for row2, column2 would be max(2, previous output row1 column2 which is 0) \u2192 2. Third element max(0, 0) \u2192 0. Third row: first element max(0, 4) \u21924. Second element max(0, 2) \u21922. Third element max(0,0) \u21920. So that fits. So the pattern is, for each row starting from the second, each element is the maximum between the input's current element and the output's element from the row above, same column.\n\nSo applying this to the test input.\n\nTest Input:\n[4, 0, 8]\n[0, 0, 0]\n[0, 7, 0]\n\nFirst row remains the same: [4,0,8].\n\nSecond row: each element is max between input's second row element and the first row's output.\n\nRow 2:\n\nColumn1: max(0,4) \u21924.\n\nColumn2: max(0,0) \u21920.\n\nColumn3: max(0,8) \u21928.\n\nSo second row becomes [4,0,8].\n\nThird row: input row is [0,7,0]. Now, compare with the second output row [4,0,8].\n\nThird row:\n\nColumn1: max(0,4) \u21924.\n\nColumn2: max(7,0) \u21927.\n\nColumn3: max(0,8) \u21928.\n\nSo third row becomes [4,7,8].\n\nPutting it all together, the output should be:\n\n[4,0,8]\n\n[4,0,8]\n\n[4,7,8]\n\nWait, let me check again. Test input's third row is [0,7,0]. The second output row is [4,0,8].\n\nSo third row column1: max(0,4) \u21924.\n\nColumn2: max(7,0) \u21927.\n\nColumn3: max(0,8) \u21928.\n\nYes. So the output matrix is:\n\nRow1: [4,0,8]\n\nRow2: [4,0,8]\n\nRow3: [4,7,8]\n\nBut let me cross-verify with the training examples. For example, in example 1, the third row becomes [7,2,8], which matches taking the max from the second output row [7,2,8]. So yes, each subsequent row uses the previous output row. So the test case should follow the same pattern.",

        "cot_2": "Okay, let's see. I need to figure out the pattern from the training examples that transforms the input matrices into the output matrices. Let's start by looking at each example one by one.\n\nLooking at Example 0:\n\nInput:\n[0, 0, 6]\n[0, 4, 0]\n[3, 0, 0]\n\nOutput:\n[0, 0, 6]\n[0, 4, 6]\n[3, 4, 6]\n\nHmm. Let me compare each row. The first row in the input and output is the same. The second row changes the third element from 0 to 6. The third row changes the second and third elements to 4 and 6. Wait, where did those numbers come from? Maybe there's some propagation happening. Like, maybe values are being filled downwards or to the right.\n\nWait, maybe it's a matter of each non-zero element propagating to the cells below and to the right. Let's check. For example 0, the 6 is in the top right. In the output, the second row's third element becomes 6, and the third row's third element is 6. The 4 in the second row's middle becomes 4 in the third row's middle. The 3 in the third row's first position stays. So perhaps each non-zero number propagates down and to the right, overwriting zeros but not existing numbers?\n\nWait, but in example 0's third row, the first element is 3, which was in the input. Then in the output, the third row becomes [3,4,6]. The 4 comes from the second row's 4, which propagates down. The 6 comes from the top right's 6 propagating down each row. So maybe the rule is that each cell in the output is the maximum value encountered so far in the column when moving from top to bottom and left to right?\n\nWait, let's check the columns. For example 0:\n\nOriginal columns (columns are vertical):\n\nColumn 0: 0, 0, 3 \u2192 Output column 0: 0, 0, 3. So maybe that's just the original values. Hmm, but the outputs in other positions change. Let me check column 1. Original input column 1: 0,4,0. Output column 1: 0,4,4. So the third element in column 1 is 4, which is the same as the second row's 4. So maybe each column is filled with the maximum value from above. Like, in column processing, you take the maximum value up to that point. Similarly, perhaps rows are processed left to right, taking the maximum from the left?\n\nWait, let's check example 0's rows. The first row is [0,0,6]. The output's first row is same. The second row's third element becomes 6. So maybe for each row, after the first element, each element is the maximum between the original value and the previous element in the row. But wait, in the input's second row, the original is [0,4,0]. The output's second row is [0,4,6]. So the third element is 6, which is the max between 0 (original) and 4 (previous element in row) but 6 comes from the first row's third element. Hmm, maybe combining row and column processing.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output matrix is generated by for each cell (i,j), the value is the maximum value from the original matrix in the rectangle from (0,0) to (i,j). Let me test that.\n\nIn example 0, the original matrix is:\n\nRow 0: 0,0,6\n\nRow 1: 0,4,0\n\nRow 2:3,0,0\n\nThe maximum for cell (0,0) is 0.\n\nFor cell (1,0): max(0,0,3) up to that cell? Wait, no. Wait, the rectangle from (0,0) to (1,0) includes cells (0,0) and (1,0). Original values 0 and 0. So max is 0. Output cell (1,0) is 0. That matches.\n\nFor cell (1,1): rectangle from (0,0) to (1,1) includes all cells in rows 0 and 1 up to column 1. The original values are 0,0 (row 0, column 0 and 1), 0,4 (row1). So max is 4. Output cell (1,1) is 4. That's correct.\n\nFor cell (1,2): the rectangle from (0,0) to (1,2). Original values are 0,0,6 (row0), 0,4,0 (row1). Max is 6. So output cell (1,2) is 6. Which matches.\n\nFor cell (2,0): rectangle (0,0) to (2,0). Values 0,0,3. Max is 3. Output cell (2,0) is 3. Correct.\n\nCell (2,1): rectangle up to (2,1). Values include row0's 0,0; row1's 0,4; row2's 3,0. Max is 4. Output cell (2,1) is 4. Correct.\n\nCell (2,2): rectangle up to (2,2). All values in the original matrix. The max is 6. Output cell (2,2) is 6. Correct.\n\nSo in this case, the output matrix is the maximum value found in the rectangle from the top-left corner (0,0) to the current cell (i,j). That seems to fit example 0.\n\nLet's check example 1:\n\nInput:\n[0,2,0]\n[7,0,8]\n[0,0,0]\n\nOutput:\n[0,2,0]\n[7,2,8]\n[7,2,8]\n\nTesting the rectangle approach. For each cell (i,j), the output is the maximum value in the rectangle (0,0) to (i,j).\n\nFor cell (0,0): max(0) = 0.\n\nCell (0,1): max of row0 up to column 1: 0 and 2 \u2192 2.\n\nCell (0,2): row0 up to column 2: 0,2,0 \u2192 max 2. But output cell (0,2) is 0. Wait, that's conflicting. Wait no. Wait the output cell (0,2) is 0. So the rectangle approach would have max 2 here, but the output is 0. That's a problem.\n\nHmm, maybe the approach is different. Let's see.\n\nIn example 1, the input's first row is [0,2,0]. The output's first row is same. The second row in output is [7,2,8]. So the second row's first element is 7 (from input), second element is 2 (from first row), third is 8 (from input). Third row becomes [7,2,8], which are the same as the second row's values.\n\nWait, maybe for each row, you take the maximum between the current cell and the cell above, and the cell to the left. So, for cell (i,j), the output value is the maximum of the original value at (i,j), the cell above (i-1,j), and the cell to the left (i,j-1). But maybe with some order.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is built by first processing rows left to right, taking the maximum of the current value and the left neighbor. Then process columns top to bottom, taking the maximum of the current value and the one above. Or vice versa.\n\nLet me test that for example 0.\n\nOriginal input example 0:\n\nRow0: [0,0,6]\n\nRow1: [0,4,0]\n\nRow2: [3,0,0]\n\nProcessing rows first, left to right:\n\nFor row0: left to right. 0, max(0,0)=0, max(0,6)=6 \u2192 remains same.\n\nRow1: first element 0. Then 4 (max 0 and 4?), but the original is 4. Then third element: 0 vs previous in row (4) \u2192 4? But output is 6. Hmm, that's not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe after processing the rows left to right, process columns top to bottom.\n\nAlternatively, process columns first. Let's see.\n\nAlternatively, the transformation is that each non-zero value propagates to the right and downward, replacing zeros but not overwriting existing non-zeros. For example, in example 0:\n\nThe 6 in (0,2) propagates down to (1,2) and (2,2). The 4 in (1,1) propagates down to (2,1). The 3 in (2,0) stays. So the zeros are filled with the nearest non-zero to the left or above.\n\nBut how?\n\nAlternatively, each cell in the output is the maximum of the cell above it and the cell to the left of it, and the original cell's value. Let's see.\n\nFor example 0:\n\nRow0:\n\nOriginal: [0,0,6]\n\nProcessing left to right. For cell (0,0), max(0) =0.\n\nCell (0,1): max(0 (original 0), left cell 0) \u2192 0.\n\nCell (0,2): max(6, left cell 0) \u2192 6. So row0 remains same.\n\nRow1:\n\nCell (1,0): max(0, above cell 0) \u2192 0.\n\nCell (1,1): original 4. Max(0 (left cell 0), 4, above cell 0) \u21924.\n\nCell (1,2): original 0. Max(4 (left cell 4), above cell 6 \u21926). So becomes 6.\n\nSo row1 becomes [0,4,6].\n\nRow2:\n\nCell (2,0): original 3. Max(3, above 0) \u21923.\n\nCell (2,1): original 0. Max(3 (left cell 3), above 4 \u21924). So 4.\n\nCell (2,2): original 0. Max(4 (left cell 4), above 6 \u21926). So 6.\n\nSo output row2 is [3,4,6]. Which matches example 0.\n\nThis seems to fit. So the rule could be: each cell in the output is the maximum of the original cell's value, the cell to the left (in the same row), and the cell above (same column). So for each cell (i,j):\n\noutput[i][j] = max( input[i][j], output[i-1][j] (if i>0), output[i][j-1] (if j>0) )\n\nBut since output is built step by step, you need to process the matrix in order, left to right, top to bottom, and for each cell, take the max of the original value, the cell above (from the output matrix), and the cell to the left (from the output matrix).\n\nLet's test this on example 1.\n\nExample1 Input:\n\nRow0: [0,2,0]\n\nRow1: [7,0,8]\n\nRow2: [0,0,0]\n\nProcessing:\n\nRow0:\n\ncell (0,0): max(0) =0.\n\ncell (0,1): max(2, left cell 0 (from output) \u21922.\n\ncell (0,2): max(0, left cell 2 \u21922. But output's row0 cell2 is 0. Wait, no. According to the example1's output, row0 remains [0,2,0], so this approach may not fit. Hmm, this is conflicting.\n\nWait, in example1's output, the first row remains the same. But according to the rule I thought, the third cell in row0 would be max(0, left cell (which is 2)), so that would be 2, but the output is 0. So that contradicts. So maybe the rule isn't that.\n\nWait, example1's output for row0 is same as input. So why isn't the third cell in row0 changed? Let me check the output again.\n\nIn example1's output:\n\nFirst row is [0,2,0]. So the third element remains 0. But according to the previous rule, if we take the max of original (0), left cell (2), then the third element would be 2. But that's not the case. So that suggests that the rule is different.\n\nHmm. Let me re-examine example1.\n\nOriginal input:\n\nRow0: 0,2,0\n\nRow1:7,0,8\n\nRow2:0,0,0\n\nOutput:\n\nRow0: 0,2,0\n\nRow1:7,2,8\n\nRow2:7,2,8\n\nSo in row1, the first element is 7 (original), the second is 2 (from row0's 2?), the third is 8 (original). Then row2 is same as row1.\n\nSo perhaps the rule is that for each cell (i,j), the value is the maximum between the current cell's original value and the value from the cell above, but not considering the left cell. Or maybe propagating down and to the right.\n\nWait, another approach: for each cell, the output is the maximum value encountered in the same column up to that row, or the same row up to that column. So combining both row and column.\n\nAlternatively, the output for cell (i,j) is the maximum of the original value at (i,j), the output value from (i-1,j), and the output value from (i,j-1). But as in the first approach, but in example1, this would change row0's third element.\n\nBut in example1's output, row0's third element is 0. So that's not possible. So perhaps the rule is different.\n\nLet me try another approach. Let's look at example2.\n\nExample2 input:\n\n[4,0,0]\n\n[0,2,0]\n\n[0,0,0]\n\nOutput:\n\n[4,0,0]\n\n[4,2,0]\n\n[4,2,0]\n\nProcessing row0: [4,0,0] remains same.\n\nRow1: first element becomes 4 (original 0, but output 4 from above). Second element is max(2, 4 (left) and 0 (above from row0's 0) \u2192 max(2,4) \u21924? But output is 2. So this approach doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. Maybe the rule is that each non-zero value in the input propagates to the right and downward, filling zeros but not overwriting existing non-zero values.\n\nIn example2, the first cell is 4. This propagates down and right. So row1's first cell is 4, row2's first cell is 4. The 2 in row1, column1 would propagate down to row2, column1, and to the right to row1, column2 (but original is 0, so becomes 2). But row1's column2 is 0 in input, so output becomes 2. But in the output, row1's third element is 0. Hmm, that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each non-zero value propagates to the right and down, but only to cells that are zero and have a non-zero to their left or above.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Let me try to look for another pattern.\n\nLooking at example1's output:\n\nThe second row in the output is [7,2,8]. The 2 comes from row0's 2. The third element 8 is original. Then the third row copies the second row.\n\nSo maybe the output for each row is the maximum between the current row and the row above, element-wise. But for example1:\n\nRow0: [0,2,0]\n\nRow1: [7,0,8]\n\nRow1 output: [7,2,8] \u2192 which is max between row0 and row1 elements. 0 vs7 \u21927; 2 vs0 \u21922; 0 vs8 \u21928. Yes, this fits.\n\nThen row2 output would be max between row1 output and row2 input. Row2 input is all zeros. So row2 output is same as row1 output.\n\nSimilarly, in example0:\n\nRow0: [0,0,6]\n\nRow1 input: [0,4,0]. Row1 output is max between row0 and row1 input, element-wise. [0 vs0, 0 vs4 \u21924, 6 vs0 \u21926 \u2192 [0,4,6]. Then row2 input is [3,0,0]. Row2 output is max between row1 output and row2 input: 3 vs0 \u21923; 4 vs0 \u21924;6 vs0 \u21926. So [3,4,6]. Which matches.\n\nExample2:\n\nRow0 input: [4,0,0]\n\nRow1 input: [0,2,0]. Row1 output is max between row0 and row1 input: 4 vs0 \u21924; 0 vs2 \u21922; 0 vs0 \u21920 \u2192 [4,2,0]. Row2 input is all zeros. So row2 output is max between row1 output and row2 input \u2192 [4,2,0]. But the actual output for row2 is [4,2,0] \u2192 which matches.\n\nSo the pattern seems to be that for each row starting from the second row, each element is the maximum between the current row's element and the element from the row above (from the output). Then, this new row becomes the basis for the next row. So it's like a cumulative maximum per column.\n\nSo the algorithm is:\n\n- The first row remains as is.\n\n- For each subsequent row, each element is the maximum between the input's current element and the output's previous row's element at the same column.\n\nWait, no. Let's re-examine example1:\n\nRow1 input: [7,0,8]. The output row1 is [7,2,8].\n\nThe previous row (output row0) is [0,2,0].\n\nSo for each column in row1:\n\nColumn0: max(7, 0) \u21927.\n\nColumn1: max(0, 2) \u21922.\n\nColumn2: max(8, 0) \u21928.\n\nSo row1 output becomes [7,2,8].\n\nThen row2 input is [0,0,0]. Compare with output row1 [7,2,8]. So row2 output is max(0 vs7 \u21927, 0 vs2 \u21922, 0 vs8 \u21928 \u2192 [7,2,8].\n\nYes, this matches.\n\nIn example0:\n\nRow0 input: [0,0,6] \u2192 output row0 same.\n\nRow1 input: [0,4,0]. Compare with output row0:\n\nmax(0,0) \u21920 \u2192 but output row1 column0 is 0.\n\nmax(4,0) \u21924 \u2192 column1.\n\nmax(0,6) \u21926 \u2192 column2.\n\nSo row1 output is [0,4,6].\n\nRow2 input: [3,0,0]. Compare with output row1 [0,4,6].\n\nmax(3,0) \u21923 \u2192 column0.\n\nmax(0,4) \u21924 \u2192 column1.\n\nmax(0,6) \u21926 \u2192 column2.\n\nSo row2 output is [3,4,6].\n\nThis fits.\n\nExample2:\n\nRow0 input: [4,0,0] \u2192 output same.\n\nRow1 input: [0,2,0]. Compare with row0's output [4,0,0]:\n\nmax(0,4) \u21924.\n\nmax(2,0) \u21922.\n\nmax(0,0) \u21920.\n\nSo row1 output is [4,2,0].\n\nRow2 input: all 0. Compare with row1 output \u2192 [4,2,0].\n\nSo this pattern works for all examples.\n\nSo the rule is:\n\nFor each row in the output matrix:\n\n- The first row is the same as the input.\n\n- For each subsequent row (i), each element (j) is the maximum between the input's (i,j) value and the output's (i-1,j) value.\n\nSo each element is the maximum of the input value at that position and the output value from the previous row's same column.\n\nThus, the output is built row by row, where each row is the element-wise maximum between the input row and the previous output row.\n\nThis explains all training examples. Now, applying this to the test input.\n\nTest input:\n\n[4,0,8]\n\n[0,0,0]\n\n[0,7,0]\n\nLet's process this step by step.\n\nFirst row (row0) of output is same as input: [4,0,8].\n\nRow1: take each element in the input row1 and compare with the output row0's elements.\n\nRow1 input is [0,0,0].\n\nCompare each element with output row0's elements [4,0,8].\n\nFor column0: max(0,4) \u21924.\n\nColumn1: max(0,0) \u21920.\n\nColumn2: max(0,8) \u21928.\n\nSo row1 output is [4,0,8].\n\nRow2 input is [0,7,0].\n\nCompare with row1 output (which is now [4,0,8]).\n\nColumn0: max(0,4) \u21924.\n\nColumn1: max(7,0) \u21927.\n\nColumn2: max(0,8) \u21928.\n\nSo row2 output is [4,7,8].\n\nThus, the full output matrix is:\n\nRow0: [4,0,8]\n\nRow1: [4,0,8]\n\nRow2: [4,7,8]\n\nWait, but let's check. Wait, the input's row2 is [0,7,0]. For row2 processing:\n\nFor each column:\n\nColumn0: max(0 (input row2, column0), 4 (output row1, column0)) \u21924.\n\nColumn1: max(7 (input row2, column1), 0 (output row1, column1)) \u21927.\n\nColumn2: max(0 (input row2, column2), 8 (output row1, column2)) \u21928.\n\nSo row2 becomes [4,7,8].\n\nThus, the output matrix should be:\n\n[4, 0, 8]\n\n[4, 0, 8]\n\n[4, 7, 8]\n\nBut let's check the training examples again to make sure. Because example2's row2 output was [4,2,0], but the row1 output was [4,2,0], and row2 input is [0,0,0]. So the row2 output was max between [0,0,0] and [4,2,0], which gives [4,2,0].\n\nYes, so the same logic applies here. So the test input's output would be as I calculated.\n\nSo the final answer should be:\n\n[4, 0, 8]\n\n[4, 0, 8]\n\n[4, 7, 8]"
