        "cot_1": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. So, looking at the training examples, each input is a 2D array, and the output is another 2D array. The goal is to see how the input is transformed into the output.\n\nStarting with Example 0. The input is:\n\n[0, 4, 0, 9]\n[0, 0, 0, 0]\n[0, 4, 6, 0]\n[1, 0, 0, 0]\n\nThe output is:\n\n[0, 0, 0, 0]\n[0, 0, 0, 0]\n[0, 4, 0, 0]\n[1, 4, 6, 9]\n\nHmm, so looking at each column. Let's check the columns in the input and output.\n\nOriginal columns (input):\n\nColumn 0: 0,0,0,1 \u2192 in output, column 0 has 0,0,0,1. Wait, but the output's first three rows are zeros. Wait, maybe the numbers are being shifted down? Let's see.\n\nIn the input's first column, the numbers are 0,0,0,1. In the output, the same column is 0,0,0,1. So no change here. But let's check another column.\n\nColumn 1 in input: 4,0,4,0 \u2192 output column 1 is 0,0,4,4. So the 4s have moved down? Like, the non-zero numbers are stacked from the bottom up?\n\nWait, maybe each column is being \"compressed\" so that all non-zero numbers fall to the bottom, but keeping their order. Let's check:\n\nOriginal column 1: [4,0,4,0]. Non-zeros are 4 and 4. In output, column 1 is [0,0,4,4]. So the two 4s are at the bottom. But why in the output of example 0, the third row has 4, and the fourth row has 4. Wait, maybe they are stacked in the order they appear from top to bottom. Wait, the original column 1 in example 0 has 4 at position 0 (top), then 0, then 4 at position 2, then 0. So when stacking to the bottom, the order of the non-zero numbers is preserved. So the two 4s would be placed starting from the bottom. So the output column would have 4 and 4 in the third and fourth rows. But in the output, it's 0,0,4,4. So the non-zero elements are moved to the bottom, but their order is preserved. So for column 1 in example 0: the non-zeros are 4 and 4, so they end up in the last two positions of the column. But the output shows that in the third row (index 2) and fourth row (index 3), there's 4 and 4. Wait, but the output for column 1 in example 0 is [0,0,4,4]. So the two 4s are placed at the bottom. So yes, the non-zeros are moved to the bottom, maintaining their original order. So in column processing, for each column, collect all non-zero numbers in their original order, then place them at the bottom of the column, filling the rest with zeros above.\n\nBut let's check another example. Example 1's input:\n\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9]\n[0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0]\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[4, 0, 7, 8, 0, 0]\n[4, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0]\n\nThe output is:\n\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[4, 0, 7, 8, 0, 0]\n[4, 0, 7, 8, 0, 9]\n\nLooking at column 0 in input: the entries are 0,0,0,4,4,4. So non-zeros are 4,4,4. In the output column 0, they are at the bottom three rows: [4,4,4] in the last three rows, which matches the output. So that's stacking non-zeros to the bottom of the column.\n\nAnother column in example 1: column 3. Input for column 3 is:\n\nRow 0: 0,8,0,0,8,0 \u2192 Wait, wait, let's list each column. Let me check the input again. Wait, the input for example1 is:\n\nRow0: [0,0,0,0,0,9]\n\nRow1: [0,0,0,8,0,0]\n\nRow2: [0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow3: [4,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow4: [4,0,7,8,0,0]\n\nRow5: [4,0,7,0,0,0]\n\nSo for column 3:\n\nRow0: 0\n\nRow1:8\n\nRow2:0\n\nRow3:0\n\nRow4:8\n\nRow5:0\n\nSo non-zero elements are 8 and 8. In the output, column3 in the last rows (rows4 and 5) have 8 and 8? Wait, looking at the output of example1:\n\nRow4 of output: [4,0,7,8,0,0]\n\nRow5: [4,0,7,8,0,9]\n\nSo in column3 of output, rows4 and 5 are 8 and 8? Wait, no. Row4 column3 is 8, row5 column3 is 8. Wait, original column3 has two 8s. So in the output, they are placed in the bottom two positions. But in the output's column3, the last two entries are 8 and 8? Wait, the output rows:\n\nRow3: [4,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow4: [4,0,7,8,0,0]\n\nRow5: [4,0,7,8,0,9]\n\nSo column3 in output is:\n\nRow0:0\n\nRow1:0\n\nRow2:0\n\nRow3:0\n\nRow4:8\n\nRow5:8\n\nWait, but the original column3 had two 8s (row1 and row4). So when stacking, the 8 from row1 comes first, then the 8 from row4. So in the output column3, the two 8s are at the bottom. So in the output, row4 and row5? No, row4 is 8, row5 is 8? Wait, output row4's column3 is 8, row5's column3 is 8? But in the input, the 8s were in row1 and row4. So in the output, they are placed in the bottom two positions of the column. So in the output column3, the 8s are in rows4 and 5. But in the output for example1, the row4 column3 is 8, row5 column3 is 8? But the output for row5 column3 is 9. Wait, no, row5 in the output of example1 is [4,0,7,8,0,9]. So column3 is 8, column6 is 9. So in the output column3 for example1, the non-zero elements (8 and 8) are placed in rows4 and 5? No, because row4 has 8, and row5 has 8. But in the original input, the two 8s are in row1 and row4. So when collecting non-zeros, the order is 8 (from row1) then 8 (from row4), so in the output column, they would be placed at the bottom, resulting in two 8s in the last two rows. So the output's column3 would be 8,8 in rows4 and 5. But in the output, row4 has 8, row5 has 8. So that's correct. So the pattern is indeed to take each column, collect non-zeros in order, then place them starting from the bottom, filling upwards, and the rest zeros.\n\nNow, looking at example2:\n\nInput:\n\n[0, 0, 0, 1, 0]\n\n[0, 3, 0, 0, 0]\n\n[0, 3, 0, 1, 2]\n\n[6, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n[0, 3, 0, 0, 0]\n\nOutput:\n\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n[0, 3, 0, 0, 0]\n\n[0, 3, 0, 1, 0]\n\n[6, 3, 0, 1, 2]\n\nLet's check column1. Input column1: [0,3,3,0,3]. So non-zeros are 3,3,3. Output column1: in the output, the column1 entries are 0,0,3,3,3. So the three 3s are at the bottom three rows. Yes, that's stacking to the bottom.\n\nAnother example is column0. Input column0: [0,0,0,6,0]. Non-zero is 6. In output, column0 is 0,0,0,0,6. Wait, but in the output, the last row (row4) has 6. So yes, 6 is placed at the bottom.\n\nSo the pattern seems to be: For each column in the input, collect all non-zero values in order from top to bottom, then place them starting from the bottom of the column upwards, filling the remaining entries with zeros above.\n\nSo the transformation is: per column, move non-zero elements to the bottom of the column, maintaining their original order, and fill the top with zeros as needed.\n\nNow, applying this to the test input.\n\nTest Input:\n\n[0, 2, 0, 4, 3]\n\n[5, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n[0, 0, 6, 0, 0]\n\n[5, 2, 0, 4, 0]\n\n[5, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nLet's process each column.\n\nEach column is processed as follows:\n\nFor each column in the input:\n\n- Collect non-zero elements in order from top to bottom.\n\n- Then, in the output column, place them starting from the bottom, so that the last element in the collected list is the bottom of the column, and fill zeros above as needed.\n\nLet's go column by column.\n\nColumns are 0,1,2,3,4.\n\nColumn0:\n\nInput rows:\n\nRow0:0\n\nRow1:5\n\nRow2:0\n\nRow3:5\n\nRow4:5\n\nSo non-zeros:5 (row1),5 (row3),5 (row4). Collected in order [5,5,5]. These should be placed at the bottom of the column, so output column0 will have zeros in rows0 and 1, then 5,5,5 in rows2,3,4. Wait, wait, no. Let's think. The output column has as many rows as the input. For column0, the output should have the non-zeros starting from the bottom. The input has 5 rows. So the non-zeros are three 5s. So in the output column0, the bottom three entries are 5,5,5 (rows2,3,4?), wait no. Wait, the rows are 0-based. Let's list the output column0.\n\nOriginal non-zero elements:5,5,5 (from row1,3,4). So when stacking from the bottom, the first 5 (row1) would be the third from bottom, then row3's 5 is next, then row4's 5 at the very bottom. Wait, no. Because when we collect non-zeros in order from top to bottom, the list is [5 (row1),5 (row3),5 (row4)]. Then, when placing them at the bottom of the column, the first element (row1's 5) would be in the third position from the top (since the column has 5 rows). Wait, let's see. For a column with 5 rows, and three non-zero elements. The output column would have three non-zeros at the bottom. So in rows 2,3,4? Wait, no. For example, if there are 5 rows, and 3 elements, they would be placed in the last three rows (rows2,3,4 if 0-based). Wait, no. Let's think of a column with 5 elements. The bottom is row4. So placing the non-zeros starting from the bottom. So the first element in the collected list (row1's 5) would be placed in row4 - (3-1) = row4 - (3-1) ? Hmm, maybe it's easier to think that for a column of length N, the non-zeros are placed starting at the bottom. So the first element in the collected list (topmost non-zero) is placed at position N - k, where k is the number of non-zeros. For example, if there are 3 non-zeros in a 5-row column, then N=5, k=3. So the first non-zero is placed at 5-3=2 (row2), then the next at row3, then row4.\n\nSo for column0's non-zeros [5,5,5], the positions would be row2,3,4. So the output column0 would be [0,0,5,5,5].\n\nBut let's check example0. In example0's column1, the input had two 4s. Output column1 is [0,0,4,4]. Since there are 4 rows, two non-zeros. So they are placed at rows2 and3 (since 4 rows, rows 0,1,2,3). So N=4, k=2. The first non-zero (from row0's 4) is placed at 4-2=2 (row2), then next at row3. So yes. So the same logic applies.\n\nSo for test input column0:\n\nNon-zeros are 5 (row1),5 (row3),5 (row4). So when placed in the output column0, rows2,3,4. So output column0: [0,0,5,5,5].\n\nNow, let's process each column.\n\nColumn0:\n\nInput entries:\n\nRow0:0\n\nRow1:5\n\nRow2:0\n\nRow3:5\n\nRow4:5\n\nNon-zeros:5,5,5 \u2192 Output column0: [0,0,5,5,5].\n\nColumn1:\n\nInput entries:\n\nRow0:2\n\nRow1:0\n\nRow2:0\n\nRow3:2\n\nRow4:0\n\nNon-zeros:2 (row0),2 (row3). So two non-zeros. Output column1 should have these in the last two rows (rows3 and4), but wait, total rows is 5. So for 5 rows, k=2. So first non-zero (row0's 2) goes to row5-2=3 (row3), then row4. So output column1: [0,0,0,2,2].\n\nWait, but row3 and row4. So the two 2s are at the bottom. So output column1 would be:\n\nRow0:0\n\nRow1:0\n\nRow2:0\n\nRow3:2 (from original row0)\n\nRow4:2 (from original row3)\n\nWait, but in the input, the order of non-zeros is row0's 2, then row3's 2. So the collected list is [2,2]. Placed starting from the bottom (row4 and row3). Wait, no. Because when you have two elements in a 5-row column, you place them in the last two positions (rows3 and4). Wait, rows are 0-based. So rows are 0,1,2,3,4. The bottom row is row4. So to place two elements, they would be in row3 and row4. So the first element (row0's 2) goes to row3, and the second (row3's 2) goes to row4. So column1 output: [0,0,0,2,2].\n\nWait, but in the original input, the first 2 is in row0, then another 2 in row3. So when stacking, the order is preserved. So in the output column, the two 2s are in row3 and row4. So yes.\n\nColumn2:\n\nInput entries:\n\nRow0:0\n\nRow1:0\n\nRow2:6\n\nRow3:0\n\nRow4:0\n\nNon-zeros:6 (row2). So output column2: [0,0,0,0,6]. Because there's only one non-zero, which is placed at the bottom (row4).\n\nColumn3:\n\nInput entries:\n\nRow0:4\n\nRow1:0\n\nRow2:0\n\nRow3:4\n\nRow4:0\n\nNon-zeros:4 (row0),4 (row3). Collected as [4,4]. Placed in rows3 and4. So output column3: [0,0,0,4,4].\n\nColumn4:\n\nInput entries:\n\nRow0:3\n\nRow1:0\n\nRow2:0\n\nRow3:0\n\nRow4:0\n\nNon-zero:3 (row0). So placed at the bottom (row4). So output column4: [0,0,0,0,3].\n\nPutting all columns together:\n\nRow0: [0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow1: [0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow2: [5,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow3: [5,2,0,4,0]\n\nRow4: [5,2,6,4,3]\n\nWait, no. Wait, let's reconstruct the rows.\n\nEach row in the output is formed by taking the elements from each processed column for that row.\n\nFor each column:\n\nColumn0: [0,0,5,5,5]\n\nSo rows 0-4: 0,0,5,5,5.\n\nColumn1: [0,0,0,2,2]\n\nRows 0-4:0,0,0,2,2.\n\nColumn2: [0,0,0,0,6]\n\nRows 0-4:0,0,0,0,6.\n\nColumn3: [0,0,0,4,4]\n\nRows 0-4:0,0,0,4,4.\n\nColumn4: [0,0,0,0,3]\n\nRows 0-4:0,0,0,0,3.\n\nNow, combine these columns into rows:\n\nRow0: col0=0, col1=0, col2=0, col3=0, col4=0 \u2192 [0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow1: col0=0, col1=0, col2=0, col3=0, col4=0 \u2192 [0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow2: col0=5, col1=0, col2=0, col3=0, col4=0 \u2192 [5,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow3: col0=5, col1=2, col2=0, col3=4, col4=0 \u2192 [5,2,0,4,0]\n\nRow4: col0=5, col1=2, col2=6, col3=4, col4=3 \u2192 [5,2,6,4,3]\n\nWait, but looking at the training examples, the output sometimes has higher numbers in upper rows. Wait, no, the example0's output for row3 is [1,4,6,9], which is the bottom row, which makes sense because all non-zeros are stacked there.\n\nSo according to this processing, the test input's output should be:\n\n[0,0,0,0,0]\n\n[0,0,0,0,0]\n\n[5,0,0,0,0]\n\n[5,2,0,4,0]\n\n[5,2,6,4,3]\n\nBut wait, let's check if this matches the pattern. But wait, looking at the test input:\n\nThe input rows are:\n\nRow0: [0,2,0,4,3]\n\nRow1: [5,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow2: [0,0,6,0,0]\n\nRow3: [5,2,0,4,0]\n\nRow4: [5,0,0,0,0]\n\nAfter processing each column as described, the output should be:\n\nRow0: all zeros.\n\nRow1: all zeros.\n\nRow2: 5 (from column0's third entry), 0,0,0,0 \u2192 [5,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow3:5 (column0), 2 (column1), 0 (column2),4 (column3),0 \u2192 [5,2,0,4,0]\n\nRow4:5,2,6,4,3 \u2192 [5,2,6,4,3]\n\nThis seems correct according to the pattern. So the final output should be the test input's columns processed as such.",

        "cot_2": "Okay, let's tackle this problem. So, the task is to find the pattern in the training examples that transforms the input matrix into the output matrix, then apply that pattern to the test input. Let's start by analyzing each training example to see if I can spot a consistent rule.\n\nStarting with Example 0:\n\nInput:\n[0, 4, 0, 9]\n[0, 0, 0, 0]\n[0, 4, 6, 0]\n[1, 0, 0, 0]\n\nOutput:\n[0, 0, 0, 0]\n[0, 0, 0, 0]\n[0, 4, 0, 0]\n[1, 4, 6, 9]\n\nLooking at the input and output, it seems like numbers are being moved or consolidated somehow. Let's check each column. For instance, in the first column of input, the numbers are 0, 0, 0, 1. In the output, the first column is 0, 0, 0, 1. That doesn't change. Let's look at the second column: 4, 0, 4, 0. The output's second column is 0, 0, 4, 4. Hmm, maybe the numbers are shifted down, but only keeping certain values. Wait, in the output's last row, the second column is 4. The input has 4 in row 0 and row 2. Maybe the numbers are being accumulated from the top and then stacked at the bottom, but zeros are inserted above. Let me check another column.\n\nThird column in input: 0,0,6,0. Output third column: 0,0,0,6. So the 6 moved to the bottom. Fourth column input: 9,0,0,0. Output is 0,0,0,9. So all non-zero numbers are moved to the bottom of their respective columns, but maintaining their order from top to bottom? Wait, in example 0's third column, the 6 was in row 2 (third row if 0-indexed), and in output it's at the bottom. So perhaps each column is being transformed so that all non-zero numbers are shifted down to the bottom of the column, preserving their original order. Let's see.\n\nTake column 2 of example 0's input: 0,0,6,0. The output for that column is 0,0,0,6. Yes, 6 is moved to the bottom. For the second column, input is 4,0,4,0. So non-zero entries are 4 (row 0) and 4 (row 2). In the output column, they are in row 2 and 3. So the order is preserved but shifted down. So the non-zeros are stacked from the bottom up, but maintaining the order they appeared from top to bottom. Wait, let's see: input column has 4 (top), then 0, then 4, then 0. Output column has 4 in row 2 and 4 in row 3. So the first 4 is in row 2, the second 4 (from row 2 input) is in row 3. So perhaps when stacking, the first occurrence is higher up, but maybe the non-zero numbers are moved to the bottom, but in the order they appear. So for each column, collect all non-zero numbers in order, then place them starting from the bottom of the column, filling upwards. Wait, no. Let me think again.\n\nWait, in example 0's second column, input has 4,0,4,0. Output is 0,0,4,4. So the two 4s are at the bottom two rows. So the order is preserved, but they are moved to the bottom. Similarly, the third column's 6 moves to the bottom. Fourth column's 9 moves to the bottom. So the pattern seems to be: for each column, take all non-zero elements in order, then place them starting from the bottom of the column, pushing them down. The zeros are filled above. So in column processing, non-zeros are shifted down to the bottom, maintaining their order from top to bottom.\n\nLet me check Example 1 to see if this holds.\n\nExample 1 Input (columns might be longer):\n\nLooking at the input:\n\nRow 0: [0,0,0,0,0,9]\n\nRow 1: [0,0,0,8,0,0]\n\nRow 2: [0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow 3: [4,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow 4: [4,0,7,8,0,0]\n\nRow 5: [4,0,7,0,0,0]\n\nOutput:\n\nRow 0: all zeros\n\nRow 1: all zeros\n\nRow 2: all zeros\n\nRow 3: [4,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow4: [4,0,7,8,0,0]\n\nRow5: [4,0,7,8,0,9]\n\nLooking at each column. Let's take column 0. Input has 0,0,0,4,4,4. Output column 0 is 0,0,0,4,4,4. So that's three 4s at the bottom. Which matches the idea: non-zeros (the three 4s) are moved to the bottom of the column. Column 1: all zeros except maybe row 3, but in output column 1 remains zeros. Column 2: in input, rows 4 and 5 have 7. Output column 2 has 7s in rows4 and 5. So 7,7 in the bottom two rows. Column3: in input, row1 has 8, row4 has 8. Output column3 has 8 in row4 and row5. Wait input row4 has 8, input row5 has 0. Wait output row4 is 8 and row5 is 8? Wait the output's row5 column3 is 8. But in input, column3's non-zeros are 8 (row1), 8 (row4), and 0 (row5). So how does that become 8 in row5? Let me recheck.\n\nWait the input for column3 (fourth column?) Let me see. Column index 3 (if zero-based) would be the fourth element in each row. Let's see:\n\nInput column3 (fourth element per row):\n\nRow0: 0\n\nRow1:8\n\nRow2:0\n\nRow3:0\n\nRow4:8\n\nRow5:0\n\nSo the non-zeros are 8 (row1) and 8 (row4). So in the output, they should be moved to the bottom of the column. The output column3 for row4 is 8 and row5 is 8. So the order is preserved. So first the 8 from row1, then the 8 from row4. So in the output, they are placed in the bottom two rows. So row4 and row5 of column3 are 8 and 8? Wait the output row5 column3 is 8. So the 8 from row1 (earlier) is placed in row4, and the 8 from row4 (later) is placed in row5. Wait, but that's the reverse. Because when you collect non-zeros from top to bottom, you have 8 (row1), then 8 (row4). So in the output, they should be placed starting from the bottom. So the first 8 (row1) would be in row5, and the next 8 (row4) in row4? But that's not the case here. Output row4 is 8, row5 is 8. Hmm, maybe I need to re-examine.\n\nWait in Example1's output, the row5 column3 is 8. Wait no, the output's row5 is [4,0,7,8,0,9]. So column3 (fourth element) is 8. So in the output, the two 8s from the input's column3 are placed in rows4 and5. Let me think: input column3's non-zeros are 8 (row1) and 8 (row4). When moving to the bottom, the first 8 (from row1) would be in row5, then the next 8 (row4) in row4? Because you have to stack them in order, starting from the bottom. So the first non-zero encountered in the column (from top) is placed at the bottom, then the next one above it, etc. Wait, maybe the non-zeros are collected in order from top to bottom, then placed starting from the bottom of the column upwards. So in Example1's column3, the non-zeros are [8,8]. So in the output column3, they are placed starting from the bottom: row5 and row4. So row5 gets 8 (from row1), and row4 gets 8 (from row4). But in the output, row4 and row5 of column3 are 8 and 8. Wait, that's not possible because the output for row4 is 8, and row5 is 8. So perhaps the order is preserved, but they are stacked from the bottom. So the first non-zero (row1's 8) is placed at the bottom (row5), then row4's 8 is placed at row4. That way, the order is preserved. Because when you collect non-zeros from top to bottom, then place them starting at the bottom of the column. So the first non-zero goes to the bottom, the next one to the position above, etc. So in Example1's column3, the two 8s would be placed in row5 and row4. But in the output, row4 has 8 (from input row4) and row5 has 8 (from input row1)? That would reverse their order. But in the output, the row4 and row5 have 8 in the same column. Wait, the output shows that in row4, column3 is 8, and row5 column3 is 8. Wait, that can't be. Let me check the actual example again.\n\nWait in Example1's output:\n\nThe rows are:\n\nRow3: [4,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow4: [4,0,7,8,0,0]\n\nRow5: [4,0,7,8,0,9]\n\nSo in column3 (fourth element), row4 is 8, row5 is 8. Wait, the input's column3 had 8 in row1 and row4. So the output's column3 has two 8s. So the first 8 (row1) and the second 8 (row4) are both placed in the column. But in the output, they're placed in row4 and row5. But how does that fit the order?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the non-zeros are collected in the order they appear from bottom to top. Let me check that. If we collect non-zeros from the bottom of the input column upwards. For column3 in Example1: starting from row5 (bottom) up to row0 (top). The non-zeros are 8 (row4) and 8 (row1). Then placing them from bottom up. So row5 would get 8 (from row4), row4 gets 8 (from row1). But in the output, row4 is 8 and row5 is 8. Hmm, that doesn't make sense either. Maybe there's another pattern here.\n\nWait perhaps the non-zero elements are moved to the bottom of their respective columns, but maintaining their relative order. So for example, in Example0's second column [4,0,4,0], the non-zeros are 4 and 4. In the output, they are placed at the bottom two positions, preserving their order (the first 4 is above the second 4). Wait, in the output, the second column is [0,0,4,4]. So the two 4s are in rows 2 and 3 (assuming 0-based). Wait, the input's 4s are in row0 and row2. So the order is preserved: the first 4 comes before the second 4 in the input, and in the output, they are placed in the bottom two rows but in the same order. So row2 (third row) has the first 4, and row3 (fourth row) has the second 4. So perhaps the non-zeros are collected in order and placed starting from the first available position from the bottom. So for column processing, collect all non-zero values in order, then fill the column from the bottom up with these values, putting zeros above. \n\nFor example, in a column [4,0,4,0], collect [4,4], then place them in the bottom two positions: [0,0,4,4]. So yes. So the process is:\n\nFor each column:\n\n1. Collect all non-zero elements in order (from top to bottom).\n\n2. Place them at the bottom of the column, in the same order, filling from the bottom up.\n\n3. Fill the remaining positions (above) with zeros.\n\nSo, for Example1's column3:\n\nNon-zeros: 8 (row1), 8 (row4). So collected in order. Then placed at the bottom two positions of the column. The column has 6 rows. So the bottom two positions are row5 and row4. Wait, if the column is 6 rows high, then the bottom positions are row5 (last), then row4, etc. Wait, no. Wait, when placing from bottom up, the first non-zero would go to the bottom-most position. Then the next one above, etc. So if you have two non-zeros, the first one (from the input's top) goes to the bottom-most position (row5), the next one (from input's row4) goes to row4. But in the output's column3, row4 is 8 and row5 is 8. That would mean the order is reversed. But in Example1's output, row5's column3 is 8 (as per the output given). Wait, let me check the actual output again.\n\nWait in Example1's output, the last row (row5) is [4,0,7,8,0,9]. So column3 (fourth element) in row5 is 8. The row4 is [4,0,7,8,0,0], so column3 is 8. So both row4 and row5 have 8 in column3. So the two 8s are placed in row4 and row5, which are the bottom two rows. So the first 8 (from row1 of input) is in row5, and the second 8 (from row4 of input) is in row4. So their order is preserved in the output. Because when you stack them from the bottom up, the first non-zero (from top) is placed at the bottom, then the next above, etc. So the order is maintained.\n\nWait, but in this case, the first non-zero (row1's 8) is placed at row5 (bottom), and the second (row4's 8) is placed at row4. So the order is preserved as per their positions in the input. So the first non-zero (row1) is lower in the output column than the second (row4). So yes, the order is preserved. So in the output column, the first non-zero (from the input's top) is at the bottom of the column, and subsequent non-zeros are placed above. So the non-zeros are stacked in the same order as they appear in the input column, starting from the bottom of the output column.\n\nNow, checking this against Example2.\n\nExample2 Input:\n\n[0, 0, 0, 1, 0]\n\n[0, 3, 0, 0, 0]\n\n[0, 3, 0, 1, 2]\n\n[6, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n[0, 3, 0, 0, 0]\n\nOutput:\n\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n[0, 3, 0, 0, 0]\n\n[0, 3, 0, 1, 0]\n\n[6, 3, 0, 1, 2]\n\nLooking at column0. Input has 0,0,0,6,0. So non-zeros are [6]. Output column0 has 6 at the bottom (row4). So yes. Column1: input has 0,3,3,0,3. Non-zeros are [3,3,3]. In output, column1 has 3 in rows2,3,4. So [0,0,3,3,3] in output's column1. So the three 3s are stacked at the bottom three rows. Column2: all zeros except row4? Wait no, input's column2 is all zeros except row2's 0 and row4's 0. Wait no, input column2 is [0,0,0,0,0], so output column2 remains zeros. Column3: input has 1,0,1,0,0. Non-zeros are 1 (row0), 1 (row2). Output column3 has 1s in rows3 and4. So first 1 (row0) is at row3, next (row2) at row4. So bottom two positions. Column4: input has 0,0,2,0,0. Non-zero is 2. Output column4 has 2 at row4 (bottom). \n\nSo yes, the pattern holds. For each column, collect non-zeros in order, then place them starting from the bottom of the column, filling upwards, with zeros above.\n\nNow, applying this to the test input.\n\nTest Input:\n\n[0, 2, 0, 4, 3]\n\n[5, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n[0, 0, 6, 0, 0]\n\n[5, 2, 0, 4, 0]\n\n[5, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nLet's process each column one by one.\n\nColumn 0:\n\nInput elements (rows 0 to4):\n\nRow0: 0\n\nRow1:5\n\nRow2:0\n\nRow3:5\n\nRow4:5\n\nNon-zeros: 5 (row1),5 (row3),5 (row4). So collected in order [5,5,5].\n\nPlace them starting at the bottom of the column. The column has 5 rows. So bottom three positions (rows4,3,2) will be 5,5,5. But since there are three non-zeros, they need to be placed in rows4,3,2. Wait, wait, no. Wait, the column has 5 elements. So the non-zeros are placed starting at the bottom. So the first 5 (row1) goes to row4, the next (row3) to row3, and the third (row4's original 5) goes to row2. So the processed column0 would be:\n\nRow0:0\n\nRow1:0\n\nRow2:5 (from original row4)\n\nRow3:5 (from original row3)\n\nRow4:5 (from original row1)\n\nWait, that can't be. Wait, no. Wait, the non-zeros are collected in the order they appear from top to bottom. So in column0, the non-zeros are at row1 (5), row3 (5), row4 (5). So the order is [5,5,5]. When placing from the bottom up, the first non-zero (5 from row1) is placed at the bottom (row4), then the next (5 from row3) at row3, then the next (5 from row4) at row2. So the column0 becomes:\n\nRow0:0\n\nRow1:0\n\nRow2:5\n\nRow3:5\n\nRow4:5\n\nWait but that's three 5s. But the original column had three 5s. So output column0 would be [0,0,5,5,5]. Let's confirm. So in the output, column0 would have 5s in rows2,3,4. But according to the pattern, the non-zeros are placed starting from the bottom. So row4 (bottom) gets the first non-zero (row1's 5), then row3 gets row3's 5, then row2 gets row4's 5. So the column becomes:\n\nRow4:5 (from row1)\n\nRow3:5 (from row3)\n\nRow2:5 (from row4)\n\nRows0-1:0\n\nSo the output column0 is [0,0,5,5,5]. But in the test input's column0, the original elements are [0,5,0,5,5]. So the non-zeros are row1, row3, row4. Collected in order [5,5,5]. So placing them in the bottom three rows (rows4,3,2) as [5,5,5]. So rows 4,3,2 would have 5s. So column0 becomes:\n\nRow0:0\n\nRow1:0\n\nRow2:0 \u2192 wait no. Wait the column has 5 rows. If we have three non-zeros, they should occupy the last three rows. Let's see:\n\nOriginal non-zeros in column0: 5 (row1), 5 (row3), 5 (row4). So three elements. The column has five rows. So when we place them starting from the bottom, the first non-zero (row1's 5) goes to row4 (bottom). The second (row3's 5) to row3. The third (row4's 5) to row2. So the column becomes:\n\nRow0:0\n\nRow1:0\n\nRow2:5 (from original row4)\n\nRow3:5 (from original row3)\n\nRow4:5 (from original row1)\n\nWait, but the original row4's 5 is the third non-zero. So in the output column, row4 is 5 (from first non-zero), row3 is 5 (second), row2 is 5 (third). So the column would be [0,0,5,5,5]. \n\nBut the original row4 had 5, which in the input is row4. So in the output, after moving, that 5 is now in row2. Wait, that might be correct according to the pattern. Let's proceed.\n\nNext, column1:\n\nOriginal elements (rows0-4):\n\nRow0:2\n\nRow1:0\n\nRow2:0\n\nRow3:2\n\nRow4:0\n\nNon-zeros:2 (row0), 2 (row3). Collected as [2,2]. Placed at the bottom two rows of the column. The column has 5 rows. So the bottom two are row4 and row3. So:\n\nRow4:2 (from row0)\n\nRow3:2 (from row3)\n\nRows0-2:0\n\nSo column1 becomes [0,0,0,2,2]. Wait, but the non-zeros are collected as [2,2], so first 2 (row0) goes to row4, second 2 (row3) goes to row3. So the output column1 is [0,0,0,2,2].\n\nColumn2:\n\nOriginal elements:\n\nRow0:0\n\nRow1:0\n\nRow2:6\n\nRow3:0\n\nRow4:0\n\nNon-zeros:6 (row2). So placed at the bottom of the column. Since column has 5 rows, row4. So column2 becomes [0,0,0,0,6].\n\nBut wait, the non-zero is in row2. When moving to the bottom, it should be placed in the bottom of the column. So in row4. So column2 output is [0,0,0,0,6].\n\nColumn3:\n\nOriginal elements:\n\nRow0:4\n\nRow1:0\n\nRow2:0\n\nRow3:4\n\nRow4:0\n\nNon-zeros:4 (row0), 4 (row3). Collected as [4,4]. Place at the bottom two rows. So row4 (from row0's 4) and row3 (from row3's 4). So column3 becomes [0,0,0,4,4].\n\nWait, but the column has 5 rows. So placing [4,4] in rows4 and 3. So output column3 would be:\n\nRow0:0\n\nRow1:0\n\nRow2:0\n\nRow3:4 (from row3)\n\nRow4:4 (from row0)\n\nWait, but according to the pattern, the first non-zero (row0's 4) is placed at the bottom (row4), then row3's 4 at row3. So yes.\n\nColumn4:\n\nOriginal elements:\n\nRow0:3\n\nRow1:0\n\nRow2:0\n\nRow3:0\n\nRow4:0\n\nNon-zero:3 (row0). So placed at the bottom of the column (row4). So column4 becomes [0,0,0,0,3].\n\nPutting all columns together:\n\nColumn0: [0,0,5,5,5]\n\nColumn1: [0,0,0,2,2]\n\nColumn2: [0,0,0,0,6]\n\nColumn3: [0,0,0,4,4]\n\nColumn4: [0,0,0,0,3]\n\nNow, we need to transpose this back into rows. Each row in the output is constructed by taking the elements from each column's processed result.\n\nSo, the output matrix would be:\n\nRow0: [0 (from col0), 0 (col1), 0 (col2), 0 (col3), 0 (col4)]\n\nRow1: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nRow2: [5, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nRow3: [5, 2, 0, 4, 0]\n\nRow4: [5, 2, 6, 4, 3]\n\nWait, wait. Wait, columns are processed, and then the rows are formed by taking the elements from each column's rows. Let's build each row step by step.\n\nProcessed columns:\n\nColumn0 after processing: [0, 0, 5, 5, 5] \u2192 rows0-4 of column0 are 0,0,5,5,5.\n\nColumn1: [0,0,0,2,2] \u2192 rows0-4:0,0,0,2,2.\n\nColumn2: [0,0,0,0,6] \u2192 rows0-4:0,0,0,0,6.\n\nColumn3: [0,0,0,4,4] \u2192 rows0-4:0,0,0,4,4.\n\nColumn4: [0,0,0,0,3] \u2192 rows0-4:0,0,0,0,3.\n\nNow, each row in the output matrix is formed by taking the elements from each column's row.\n\nSo row0 of output is column0's row0, column1's row0, column2's row0, column3's row0, column4's row0 \u2192 [0,0,0,0,0].\n\nRow1: column0's row1 (0), column1's row1 (0), etc. \u2192 [0,0,0,0,0].\n\nRow2: column0's row2 (5), column1's row2 (0), column2's row2 (0), column3's row2 (0), column4's row2 (0) \u2192 [5,0,0,0,0].\n\nRow3: column0's row3 (5), column1's row3 (2), column2's row3 (0), column3's row3 (4), column4's row3 (0) \u2192 [5,2,0,4,0].\n\nRow4: column0's row4 (5), column1's row4 (2), column2's row4 (6), column3's row4 (4), column4's row4 (3) \u2192 [5,2,6,4,3].\n\nSo the output matrix would be:\n\n[0,0,0,0,0]\n\n[0,0,0,0,0]\n\n[5,0,0,0,0]\n\n[5,2,0,4,0]\n\n[5,2,6,4,3]\n\nBut let's check if this matches the pattern of the training examples. For example, in Example0, the first row of the output was all zeros, and the non-zeros were shifted down. Here, the non-zeros in each column are indeed moved to the bottom. The test input's columns are processed correctly according to the pattern.\n\nSo the final answer should be as follows."
