        "cot_1": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. So, we have these input matrices and their corresponding outputs. Let's start by looking at the examples one by one.\n\nFirst, Example 0:\nInput is a 3x3 matrix:\n[2, 0, 2]\n[0, 2, 0]\n[2, 0, 2]\nOutput is [1]. Hmm. I need to see what's special about this matrix. Maybe counting the number of 2s? Let's check. Each row has two 2s. Wait, first row has two 2s (positions 0 and 2), middle row has one 2 (position 1), and third row again two. Wait, total 2s would be 2+1+2=5. But the output is 1. Not sure that's the way.\n\nLooking at Example 1:\nInput:\n[2, 0, 0]\n[2, 0, 0]\n[0, 2, 0]\nOutput is [7]. Let's count 2s here. First row has 1, second row 1, third row 1. Total 3. Output is 7. Hmm, not matching. Maybe positions of 2s?\n\nLooking at Example 2:\nInput has three rows all [2,0,2]. Output is [1]. So three rows each with two 2s. But in Example 0, the middle row had one 2, and output was also 1. So maybe not the count. Maybe the arrangement?\n\nExample 3:\nInput:\n[0,0,0]\n[2,0,2]\n[0,0,0]\nOutput is [1]. Here the middle row has two 2s, others all zeros. So maybe when there's a central row with two 2s? But Example 0's middle row had one 2 and output was 1. So that might not be it.\n\nExample 4:\nInput:\n[2,2,0]\n[0,2,2]\n[0,0,0]\nOutput is 7. Let's see. First row has two 2s (positions 0 and 1), second row two 2s (positions 1 and 2), third row none. Total 4. Output is 7. Hmm. Maybe the shape formed by the 2s? Like if they form a certain pattern. In Example 4, the 2s form a kind of diagonal from top left to middle right. Maybe that's a 7 shape? But not sure.\n\nWait, the outputs are either 1 or 7. So perhaps it's a binary thing, where 1 and 7 represent some kind of digit, maybe in a 7-segment display. So maybe the pattern of 2s in the matrix corresponds to a digit. Let's think about that.\n\nIn a 3x3 grid, each cell could represent a segment in a 7-segment display. Let's map them:\n\nImagine the 3x3 grid as the segments:\n\n a\nb c\n d\ne f\n g\n\nBut maybe the standard 7-segment layout is represented as:\n\n a\nf b\n g\ne c\n d\n\nBut I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe each cell in the 3x3 grid corresponds to a segment. For example:\n\nThe top row (positions 0,1,2) might correspond to the top segment (a), the middle left and right to f and b, the middle row to g, etc. But this is getting complicated. Let's see.\n\nLooking at Example 0's input:\n\nRow 0: [2,0,2] \u2192 maybe the top and right are on (assuming 2 represents a lit segment). Then middle row [0,2,0] \u2192 center is on. Bottom row [2,0,2]. So maybe the segments a, d, g (horizontal) and some verticals. But how does this form a 1?\n\nA 1 in 7-segment is the right two vertical segments (c and b, perhaps). If in the matrix, the middle column is lit. Let's check Example 0's middle column: 0,2,0. So the middle column is 2 in the center. Hmm. But in the output, it's 1. So maybe when the middle column has a 2 in the center, it's a 1. But in Example 3, the middle row has two 2s (positions 0 and 2?), but the middle column is 0 in the first and third rows. Wait, Example 3's input is:\n\nRow0: all 0s.\n\nRow1: [2,0,2], so middle is 0.\n\nRow2: all 0s. So middle column is 0 in all rows except row1's middle is 0. Wait, but output is 1. That contradicts the earlier idea.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the presence of certain patterns. Let's look at the 7 outputs. For example, Example1's output is 7. Let's see the matrix:\n\nRow0: [2,0,0]\n\nRow1: [2,0,0]\n\nRow2: [0,2,0]\n\nSo 2s are in positions (0,0), (1,0), (2,1). If this forms a 7 in the grid. Maybe the 7 is the top row (left), middle left (down), and middle middle. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the number of connected components of 2s. But in Example0, there are 2s in the corners and the center. How connected? Diagonally connected? Maybe if they are connected, it's 1, else 7? Not sure.\n\nAnother approach: looking at the sum of certain positions. For example, in the 3x3 grid, each cell could be a binary digit (if 2 is considered as 1, 0 as 0). Then convert the binary to a number. But that seems unlikely. Let's check:\n\nExample0's input has 2s at (0,0), (0,2), (1,1), (2,0), (2,2). If we treat 2 as 1, the binary number would be 101 (row0) 010 (row1) 101 (row2). But converting that to a number is tricky. Maybe sum all the 2s modulo something. Example0 has 5 2s. 5 mod 8 is 5, but output is 1. Not matching.\n\nAlternatively, the positions of the 2s correspond to the segments of the digit. For instance, the digit 1 uses two vertical segments on the right, and the digit 7 uses the top, upper right, and middle. Let's map the 3x3 grid to a 7-segment display.\n\nStandard 7-segment layout:\n\n a \nf b\n g \ne c\n d \n\nBut in a 3x3 grid, perhaps:\n\nTop row (row0) is segment a.\n\nMiddle row (row1) is segments f (left), g (middle), b (right).\n\nBottom row (row2) is segments e (left), d (middle), c (right).\n\nWait, maybe:\n\nSegments:\n\na: top row (0,0), (0,1), (0,2)\n\nb: right column (0,2), (1,2), (2,2)\n\nc: bottom right (2,2)\n\nWait, perhaps this is getting too complicated. Let's try to think of each cell as part of a segment.\n\nAlternatively, in a 3x3 grid, the 7-segment digits can be represented as follows:\n\nDigit 1: the middle and right columns lit. So columns 1 and 2 (middle and right) in all rows. But looking at Example0's input, the middle column (1) has 0, 2, 0. So only the middle row has a 2. But the output is 1. Hmm. Maybe the middle column's center is lit (like a vertical line in the center) for 1. But in Example3, the input has middle row [2,0,2], so middle column (index1) is 0. But the output is still 1. That contradicts.\n\nWait, maybe the presence of two 2s in each row. Let's check:\n\nExample0: Each row has 2, 0, 2 \u2192 2 2s in row0 and row2, row1 has one. But output is 1. Example2 has all rows with two 2s, output 1. Example3: middle row has two 2s, others zero. Output 1. So maybe whenever there's an even number of 2s per row, or some pattern like that. But Example1's rows: first row 1, second row 1, third row 1. Output is 7. So maybe when there's an odd number per row, but not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern of 2s forms the digits 1 or 7. Let's visualize:\n\nFor example, output 1:\n\nLooking at Example0's matrix:\n\n2 0 2\n\n0 2 0\n\n2 0 2\n\nIf the 2s form a cross (middle of each edge), maybe that's a 1 in some way.\n\nOutput 7's examples: like Example1's matrix:\n\n2 0 0\n\n2 0 0\n\n0 2 0\n\nHere, the 2s are in the left column (top and middle rows) and middle of the bottom row. Maybe forming a 7 shape. Like a top horizontal line, then a vertical line down the left, then a diagonal? Not exactly. But perhaps if the top left, middle left, and middle middle are 2s, forming a 7.\n\nAlternatively, count the number of corners with 2s. For Example0, corners are all 2s (top-left, top-right, bottom-left, bottom-right). That's four 2s. Output is 1. But Example3's corners are all 0s except middle row's first and third elements. Not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps the output is the count of enclosed areas formed by the 2s. Like, in Example0, the 2s form a sort of frame, which encloses a single area. Hence output 1. But Example1's 2s might form 0 enclosed areas, but output is 7, which doesn't fit. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the output is determined by the number of 2s in specific positions. For example, if certain cells (like the middle) have 2s, it's 1. Else, it's 7. But Example0's middle cell (1,1) is 2, output is 1. Example3's middle row has 2s in first and third positions (but middle is 0), output is 1. So that's conflicting.\n\nWait, let's look at all examples where output is 1:\n\nExamples 0, 2, 3.\n\nExample0: 2s in corners and center.\n\nExample2: all rows are [2,0,2], so corners and center in each row? Wait, no: each row is 2,0,2. So in the entire matrix, the first and third columns are 2s in all rows. Middle column is 0 except row1 in Example0. Hmm.\n\nWait, in Example2's input:\n\nAll three rows are [2,0,2]. So columns 0 and 2 have 2s in all rows. So columns 0 and 2 are all 2s. The middle column (column 1) is all 0s. So the matrix looks like two vertical lines (left and right) of 2s. Which could represent a '1' if those are the two vertical lines on the right (like in a 7-segment display). But that's for 1, but in this case, it's left and right. Maybe the vertical lines are on both sides, forming a sort of '11', but output is 1. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, if the 2s form a symmetric pattern. For example, mirroring along the vertical or horizontal axis. Example0's matrix is symmetric along both vertical and horizontal axes. Output is 1. Example2 is symmetric. Example3's matrix is symmetric along the horizontal axis (middle row). So maybe symmetry leads to output 1. What about the examples with output 7?\n\nExample1's matrix is:\n\n[2,0,0]\n\n[2,0,0]\n\n[0,2,0]\n\nThis is not symmetric. So perhaps when the 2s form a symmetric pattern, the output is 1, otherwise 7. Let's check other examples.\n\nExample4's input:\n\n[2,2,0]\n\n[0,2,2]\n\n[0,0,0]\n\nThis is not symmetric. So output 7. Example5's input:\n\n[2,2,0]\n\n[0,2,0]\n\n[0,0,0]\n\nAlso not symmetric. Output 7. So this seems to hold.\n\nSo the pattern might be: if the arrangement of 2s is symmetric (either vertical, horizontal, or both), output is 1. Otherwise, output is 7.\n\nNow, let's verify this with all examples.\n\nExample0: Symmetric (mirror vertically and horizontally). Output 1. Correct.\n\nExample1: Not symmetric. Output 7. Correct.\n\nExample2: Symmetric (columns 0 and 2 are all 2s, symmetric vertically). Output 1. Correct.\n\nExample3: The middle row is [2,0,2], others are 0. Symmetric horizontally (middle row is the axis). Output 1. Correct.\n\nExample4: The first row is [2,2,0], second [0,2,2], third [0,0,0]. Not symmetric. Output 7. Correct.\n\nExample5: First row [2,2,0], second [0,2,0], third all 0. Not symmetric. Output 7. Correct.\n\nSo the pattern is: if the matrix of 2s is symmetric (either vertically, horizontally, or both), then output is [1]. Otherwise, output is [7].\n\nNow, let's apply this to the test input:\n\nTest Input:\n\n[2,0,2]\n\n[2,2,2]\n\n[2,0,2]\n\nSo the matrix is:\n\nRow0: 2,0,2\n\nRow1: 2,2,2\n\nRow2: 2,0,2\n\nCheck for symmetry.\n\nFirst, check vertical symmetry (left-right). Each row should be mirrored around the center column.\n\nRow0: [2,0,2] \u2192 mirrored. Yes.\n\nRow1: [2,2,2] \u2192 mirrored. Yes.\n\nRow2: [2,0,2] \u2192 mirrored. Yes.\n\nSo vertically symmetric.\n\nCheck horizontal symmetry (top-bottom). The matrix should be mirrored around the middle row.\n\nRow0 vs Row2: [2,0,2] vs [2,0,2] \u2192 same. So symmetric.\n\nMiddle row is [2,2,2], which is symmetric on its own.\n\nSo the entire matrix is symmetric both vertically and horizontally. Therefore, according to the pattern, the output should be [1].",

        "cot_2": "Okay, let's tackle this puzzle. The task is to find a pattern that maps the given 3x3 grids of numbers (0s and 2s) to a single number output. Let me look through the training examples to spot any possible patterns.\n\nStarting with Example 0:\nInput:\n[2,0,2]\n[0,2,0]\n[2,0,2]\nOutput: [1]\nHmm. Maybe counting the number of 2s? Let's check. Each row here has two 2s. Total 2s would be 2+1+2=5? But the output is 1. Maybe not. Alternatively, maybe looking at symmetry. The grid looks symmetric. The first and third rows are the same, and the middle row is symmetrical. But how does that lead to 1?\n\nExample 1:\nInput:\n[2,0,0]\n[2,0,0]\n[0,2,0]\nOutput: [7]\nThis grid isn't symmetrical. Let's count 2s here. First row has 1, second row 1, third row 1. Total 3. Output is 7. Not sure. Maybe the positions of the 2s matter. For example, in the first example, maybe the center is a 2. Let's see: Example 0's center is 2. Output is 1. Example 1's center is 0. Output is 7. Hmm. Maybe when the center is 2, output is 1, else 7? Let's check other examples.\n\nExample 2:\nInput is all three rows [2,0,2]. So center elements are 0,0,0. Wait, no. Each row is [2,0,2], so the middle element of each row is 0. But the output is [1]. Wait, but according to my previous idea, if center (the middle element of the middle row) is 0, output should be 7. But here output is 1. So that idea is wrong.\n\nWait, maybe the center cell (row 2, column 2) is 2 or not. Let's check each example.\n\nExample 0: middle row is [0,2,0]. So center is 2. Output 1. Example1: middle row is [2,0,0]. So center is 0. Output 7. Example2: All three rows are [2,0,2]. Middle row's center is 0. But output is 1. Wait, that contradicts. So that theory is invalid.\n\nAlternative approach: Maybe the number of 2s in certain positions. For example, the corners. Let's check:\n\nExample0: Corners (top-left, top-right, bottom-left, bottom-right) are all 2. So 4 corners. Output 1. Example1: Corners: top-left (2), top-right (0), bottom-left (0), bottom-right (0). So 1 corner. Output 7. Hmm. Maybe if the number of corner 2s is even or odd. Example0 has 4 (even), output 1. Example1 has 1 (odd), output7. Let's check others.\n\nExample2: All corners are 2. So 4 corners (even). Output is 1. That fits. Example3: Input is [0,0,0] in first and third rows, middle row [2,0,2]. So corners: all 0. So 0 corners (even). Output is 1. Example4: First row [2,2,0], so top-left 2, top-right 0. Middle row [0,2,2]. Bottom row [0,0,0]. Corners: top-left 2, top-right 0, bottom-left 0, bottom-right 0. So 1 corner (odd). Output7. Example5: First row [2,2,0], corners top-left 2, top-right 0. Bottom row [0,0,0], so bottom-left 0, bottom-right 0. Total 1 corner. Output7. So seems like when the number of 2s in the four corners is even, output is 1; when odd, 7. That seems to fit all examples. Let's verify:\n\nExample0: 4 corners \u2192 even \u2192 1. Correct.\nExample1: 1 corner \u2192 odd \u21927. Correct.\nExample2:4 \u21921. Correct.\nExample3:0\u2192even\u21921. Correct.\nExample4:1\u21927. Correct.\nExample5:1\u21927. Correct.\n\nSo the pattern is: count the number of 2s in the four corner cells. If even \u2192 output [1], else [7].\n\nNow, applying this to the Test Input:\n\nTest Input:\n[2,0,2]\n[2,2,2]\n[2,0,2]\n\nCorners: top-left is first element of first row \u2192 2. Top-right is third element of first row \u21922. Bottom-left is first element of third row \u21922. Bottom-right is third element of third row \u21922. So all four corners are 2. Number of 2s in corners:4 (even). Therefore, output should be [1]."

        "cot_1": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. So, the problem is about transforming a 3x3 grid of numbers (with 0s and 2s) into a single number in brackets. Let's look at the training examples to see if I can spot a pattern.\n\nStarting with Example 0:\nInput:\n[2, 0, 2]\n[0, 2, 0]\n[2, 0, 2]\nOutput: [1]\nHmm. The grid has 2s arranged in a cross maybe? Let me count the number of 2s. The first row has two 2s, the second has one, the third has two. Total 5. But output is 1. Not sure yet.\n\nExample 1:\nInput:\n[2, 0, 0]\n[2, 0, 0]\n[0, 2, 0]\nOutput: [7]\nSo here, the 2s are in the first column (two in first column?), then a 2 in the middle of the third row. Total maybe 3? Output is 7. Hmm. Not obvious.\n\nExample 2:\nInput is all 2s except the middle of each row? Wait, each row is [2,0,2], so three rows. Each row has two 2s. Total 6? Output is 1. So maybe not a count.\n\nWait, maybe it's something to do with the positions of the 2s. Let's look for symmetry or patterns in their placement.\n\nLooking at Example 0: the 2s form a diagonal cross. Like the center is 2, and the four corners are 2s? Wait, first row is 2,0,2, second is 0,2,0, third is 2,0,2. So yes, a cross. The output is 1. Maybe when there's a cross pattern, output is 1.\n\nExample 2's input is same as example 0? Wait no, example 2's input is three rows all [2,0,2]. So same as example 0. So output is 1. So cross pattern gives 1.\n\nThen Example 3's input is:\n[0,0,0]\n[2,0,2]\n[0,0,0]\nSo the middle row has two 2s. Output is 1. So maybe any cross (horizontal or vertical) or maybe the presence of a cross in some way. Wait, in example 3, the middle row has two 2s, but the vertical columns in the middle. Wait, maybe it's a vertical line. The middle column here is [0,0,0], so no. Hmm. Maybe any line (row or column) that has two 2s and a 0 in the middle? Not sure.\n\nNow let's look at the outputs that are 7. Example 1's output is 7. The input is:\nFirst row: [2,0,0]\nSecond row: [2,0,0]\nThird row: [0,2,0]\nSo the 2s are in the first column (two 2s) and the middle of the third row. How does that relate to 7? Maybe counting something else. Or maybe the shape formed by the 2s is like the number 7. Let's visualize. The first two rows have 2s in the first column, then the third row's middle is 2. So it's like the top-left two cells and the middle of the bottom row. That could form a 7 shape if you imagine the 2s as points. Maybe the number is determined by the shape of the 2s resembling a digit.\n\nSimilarly, Example 4's input:\n[2,2,0]\n[0,2,2]\n[0,0,0]\nSo the 2s are in first row first two, second row last two. Maybe that forms a 7 when connected. Like a diagonal line from top-left to middle, then a horizontal line to the right. Maybe that's a 7. The output is 7 here. So if the pattern of 2s resembles a 7, output is 7. Otherwise, output 1. So the 1 is maybe for a cross or other shape.\n\nTesting this idea, let's look at example 5:\nInput:\n[2,2,0]\n[0,2,0]\n[0,0,0]\nThe 2s are first row first two, second row middle. So that's like a 7: the vertical line on the left and the horizontal on top. Maybe that's a 7. Output is 7. So maybe the output is 1 when the 2s form a cross, and 7 when they form a 7-like shape.\n\nSo the test input is:\n[0,0,0]\n[2,0,0]\n[2,0,0]\nThe 2s are in the second row first column and third row first column. So two 2s in the first column. That's a vertical line on the left. Does that look like a 1? But according to previous examples, a vertical line (like example 3's middle row has two 2s in middle row, but example 3's output is 1). Wait, example 3's input is:\n\n[0,0,0]\n[2,0,2]\n[0,0,0]\nSo middle row has two 2s. That's a horizontal line. Output is 1. So maybe any line (horizontal, vertical, diagonal) that's straight would be 1, and a 7 shape (like two lines at right angle) would be 7.\n\nIn the test input, the two 2s in the first column (vertical line). So according to example 3, a horizontal line gives 1, so maybe vertical line also gives 1. But in example 5, the 2s are first row first two, and second row middle. That's a 7 shape. The test input's 2s are vertical line, which would be a 1. But the test input's output isn't given. Wait, the test input's 2s are in rows 2 and 3, first column. So vertical line. So maybe output is 1. But let me check the examples again.\n\nWait, example 0's cross gives 1. Example 3's horizontal line gives 1. So vertical line would also be 1. But in the test input, the 2s are in the first column, two in a vertical line (rows 2 and 3). So two 2s vertically. So according to previous examples, maybe that's a 1. But let's check.\n\nBut wait, example 4 and 5 output 7. Example 4's 2s form a diagonal line in first row (first two), then the second row (second and third). So maybe that's a diagonal line and a horizontal line, forming a 7. Example 5's 2s form a vertical line in first column and a horizontal line in the first row, making a 7 shape. So the 7 is when there's a corner, like two lines meeting at a right angle.\n\nIn the test input, the two 2s are in the first column, rows 2 and 3. So vertical line. No horizontal line. So perhaps that's a 1. But let's see. Let me think of the output as 1 when the 2s form a straight line (horizontal, vertical, or diagonal cross), and 7 when they form a right angle (like 7). \n\nSo the test input has two 2s in a vertical line, but only two cells. Wait, each example's input has 3 rows and 3 columns. For a vertical line to be considered a line, maybe it needs three cells? But example 3's middle row has two 2s (a horizontal line with two cells). So perhaps even two cells in a line (horizontal or vertical) counts as a line. So in the test case, two vertical cells in the first column. That's a vertical line. So according to previous examples, that would be output 1. But in example 1, the 2s are in the first column (two cells) and the middle of the third row, forming a 7 shape, which outputs 7. So the test input's case is vertical line only (two cells). So maybe that's a line (1). But the output of example 1, which has a vertical line (two cells) plus another 2, forms a 7 shape, leading to 7. So the test input has two 2s in a vertical line, but no other 2s. So maybe that's a straight line (vertical), hence output 1. \n\nBut looking back, example 3's output is 1 with a horizontal line (middle row has two 2s). So two 2s in a horizontal line gives 1. So two 2s in a vertical line (test input) would also give 1. So the test output should be [1]. But wait, let me check the examples again. \n\nWait, in example 0, there's a cross (five 2s), output 1. Example 3 has two 2s in a horizontal line (output 1). So the pattern seems to be that any line (horizontal, vertical, or cross) of 2s (even just two) outputs 1. If the 2s form a 7 shape (right angle), output 7. \n\nSo the test input has two 2s in the same column (vertical line), so output [1]. But let's see the test input again:\n\nTest input:\nRow 1: [0,0,0]\nRow 2: [2,0,0]\nRow 3: [2,0,0]\nSo the two 2s are in the first column, rows 2 and 3. So vertical line. That should be output 1. But let's look at example 4. Example 4's input is:\nRow1: [2,2,0]\nRow2: [0,2,2]\nRow3: [0,0,0]\nHere, row1 has first two as 2s (horizontal), row2 has last two as 2s (horizontal). But arranged in a diagonal pattern? Maybe the shape is like a 7. So two horizontal lines offset, forming a diagonal. So output is 7. \n\nSo the key is whether the 2s form a straight line (1) or a right-angled 7 shape (7). \n\nIn the test case, it's a vertical line (two cells). According to example 3, a horizontal line (two cells) gives 1, so vertical should also give 1. Hence the answer is [1]. \n\nBut wait, example 1's input has two 2s in the first column (rows 1 and 2) and a 2 in the middle of row 3. So that's a vertical line of two, then a single 2 to the right, forming a 7. So that's why it's 7. \n\nIn the test input, the two 2s are in a vertical line, but there's no third 2 forming a right angle. So it's a straight line. Therefore, output should be [1]. \n\nBut wait, let me check the number of 2s. Example 0 has five 2s, output 1. Example 3 has two 2s, output 1. Example 4 has four 2s, output 7. So the count doesn't matter. It's the shape. \n\nSo the test input has two 2s vertically aligned. So it's a vertical line. Output 1. \n\nBut wait, the test input's vertical line is two cells. The examples where output is 1 include cross (five cells), horizontal line (two cells), cross again (example 2, which is three rows each with two 2s, forming three horizontal lines?), but example 2's output is 1. So maybe any arrangement where 2s form straight lines (horizontal, vertical, or cross) gives 1. The 7 is when they form a right angle. \n\nTherefore, the test input's vertical line (two cells) would be [1].",

        "cot_2": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. So, we have a bunch of 3x3 grids as inputs, and each outputs a single number in a list. The outputs are either [1] or [7]. Let's look at the examples one by one.\n\nStarting with Example 0:\nInput:\n[2, 0, 2]\n[0, 2, 0]\n[2, 0, 2]\nOutput: [1]\nHmm, maybe it's counting something. The 2s are arranged in a cross shape maybe? Let me check. The middle row has a 2 in the center, and the top and bottom have 2s in the middle as well. Wait, no. The first and third rows have 2s at the ends. Maybe it's forming an X pattern? Like diagonals. Let me see. The positions (0,0), (0,2), (1,1), (2,0), (2,2) are 2s. Wait, but the middle row's center is 2 here. So maybe if the center is 2, it's a 1. Not sure yet.\n\nExample 1:\nInput:\n[2,0,0]\n[2,0,0]\n[0,2,0]\nOutput: [7]\nLooking at this, the first two rows have 2s in the first column, and the third row has a 2 in the middle. So maybe the pattern is based on the positions of the 2s. Maybe counting how many 2s are in certain positions? Or maybe the arrangement forms the number 7 when connected. Like, the 2s form the shape of a 7. Let's imagine: the first two columns in the first two rows would form the vertical line of the 7, and the middle of the third row is the horizontal part. That does look like a 7. So maybe if the 2s form a 7 shape, the output is 7, otherwise 1.\n\nExample 2:\nInput is all rows as [2,0,2], so three rows like that. Output is [1]. If arranged as three horizontal lines with 2s on the ends, maybe that's forming a different shape, but the output is 1. So maybe when the 2s form a cross (like the center and the corners?), output is 1. But in this case, the middle of each row is 0, so maybe it's not a cross. Wait, in example 0, the middle of the middle row is 2. So maybe cross is when the center and diagonals are 2s. Wait example 0's grid:\nRow 0: 2,0,2\nRow 1: 0,2,0\nRow 2: 2,0,2\nThat's like a cross centered at (1,1). So maybe when the cross is present, output is 1. Example 2 has three rows of [2,0,2], which would have 2s at the corners and the ends. Wait, maybe it's a diamond shape? Not sure. But the output is 1 here again. So maybe any grid that has symmetry around the center, forming a cross or similar, gives 1. And grids where 2s form a 7 shape give 7.\n\nLooking at Example 3:\nInput:\n[0,0,0]\n[2,0,2]\n[0,0,0]\nOutput is [1]. So here, the middle row has 2s on both ends. Maybe that's considered a horizontal line. But how does that correspond to 1? Or maybe the count of 2s? Let's see. Example 0 has 5 2s. Example 1 has 3 2s. Outputs are 1 and 7 respectively. So maybe not the count. Hmm.\n\nExample 4:\nInput:\n[2,2,0]\n[0,2,2]\n[0,0,0]\nOutput: [7]\nLooking at the 2s here. First row has two 2s, then the second row has two 2s starting from the middle. So maybe this forms the number 7. The vertical line on the left (first column first row, second row's middle) and then the horizontal line in the second row. Wait, maybe not. Let me visualize:\n\nRow 0: 2,2,0 \u2192 the first two positions.\nRow 1: 0,2,2 \u2192 middle and last positions.\nSo the 2s form a kind of diagonal from top left to middle, then middle to bottom right? Or maybe the shape is like the 7, which is a horizontal top and diagonal down. Alternatively, maybe the 2s form the number 7 when you look at their positions. For example, the 7 is usually a horizontal top line and a vertical line down the right. But here, maybe it's different. Alternatively, maybe the positions of the 2s correspond to segments in a seven-segment display, which is how numbers are displayed.\n\nWait, that's a possibility. Let's think of each cell in the 3x3 grid as a segment in a seven-segment display. The seven-segment display has segments labeled a to g. For example:\n\n a\nb c\n d\ne f\n g\n\nBut how would a 3x3 grid map to that? Alternatively, the 3x3 grid could represent the seven segments arranged as follows:\n\nThe top row (middle) is segment a, the upper right is segment b, the middle row middle is d, etc. But this might be a stretch. Alternatively, each cell corresponds to a part of the digit. For example, the number 1 in a seven-segment display uses two vertical segments on the right. The number 7 uses the top horizontal and the right vertical. So perhaps the 2s in the grid correspond to lit segments.\n\nLooking back at Example 0's output [1], perhaps the 2s form the segments of a 1. The 1 in seven-segment is the right vertical segments. So in the grid, maybe the middle column (positions [0][1], [1][1], [2][1]) are lit. But in example 0, the middle column has 0 in the first and third rows, but 2 in the middle. So that would be just the center. That's not matching. Hmm. Maybe another approach.\n\nAlternatively, the pattern is that if the 2s form a cross (like a plus sign) then output is 1, and if they form a 7 shape (like the top row and a diagonal or something) then output is 7.\n\nLooking at Example 1's input:\nRow 0: [2,0,0]\nRow 1: [2,0,0]\nRow 2: [0,2,0]\nSo the 2s are in positions (0,0), (1,0), (2,1). Connecting these would form a vertical line on the left for the first two rows, then a single in the middle of the third row. That looks like the number 7. So maybe the output is 7 when the 2s form the shape of a 7, and 1 otherwise.\n\nTesting this hypothesis with other examples:\n\nExample 3's input is:\n[0,0,0]\n[2,0,2]\n[0,0,0]\nThis middle row has 2s at the ends. That might form a horizontal line in the middle. Maybe that's considered a 1. Wait, but the output is [1], so maybe 1 is for a horizontal line in the middle (like the seven-segment display's middle segment, but that's for 0 or other numbers). Hmm, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 1 is output when there's a vertical line in the middle. For example, in Example 3, the middle row has 2s on the ends, but not the middle. So that's not vertical. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 1 is when the number of 2s is odd, and 7 when even. Let's check:\n\nExample 0: 5 2s \u2192 odd \u2192 output 1. Example 1: 3 2s \u2192 odd \u2192 output 7. So that doesn't fit. So that's not the case.\n\nAlternative approach: perhaps the output is the sum of the positions of the 2s modulo something, but that seems complicated.\n\nLooking at the test input:\n\nTest Input:\n[0, 0, 0]\n[2, 0, 0]\n[2, 0, 0]\n\nSo the 2s are in (1,0) and (2,0). Let's see. That's a vertical line in the first column. The number 1 in seven-segment is the right two vertical segments, but this is the left. Alternatively, maybe this is the left vertical line, which could be part of a 4 or other numbers. But according to the examples, when there's a vertical line, maybe it's outputting 1. Or maybe in this case, the shape is similar to example 1. Let's compare to example 1:\n\nExample 1 has 2s at (0,0), (1,0), (2,1). So the vertical line on the left for two rows, then a single in the middle of the third row. The test input has vertical line on the left for the last two rows. Hmm, but example 5's input is:\n\n[2,2,0]\n[0,2,0]\n[0,0,0]\nWhich has 2s at (0,0), (0,1), (1,1). Output is 7. Maybe that's forming the top horizontal and middle vertical, making a 7 shape.\n\nWait, perhaps the key is that in the 7 outputs, the 2s form the top row and a diagonal. For instance, in example 1, the vertical line on the left and the middle in the third row. Or maybe it's the top row and a diagonal down to the right. For example, in example 4:\n\nInput:\n[2,2,0]\n[0,2,2]\n[0,0,0]\n\nSo 2s are at (0,0), (0,1), (1,1), (1,2). This forms a diagonal from top-left to middle, then to bottom-right. But the output is 7. Maybe that's considered a 7. Alternatively, the top row (positions (0,0) and (0,1)) form the top bar, and the (1,1) and (1,2) form the diagonal down to the right.\n\nIn the test input, the 2s are in (1,0) and (2,0). That's a vertical line on the left. How does that relate to 7? Maybe not. But according to the examples, maybe vertical lines on the left are part of the 7. For example, example 1's first two rows have 2s in the first column, then a 2 in the middle of the third row. That's like a vertical line on the left and then a horizontal in the middle, forming a 7. So in the test input, the 2s are in the first column in the second and third rows. So it's a vertical line in the first column but only two cells. Maybe that's part of the 7's structure. Alternatively, maybe when there are exactly two 2s in the first column and one in another position, it forms a 7.\n\nBut I'm not sure. Let's look at example 5:\n\nInput:\n[2,2,0]\n[0,2,0]\n[0,0,0]\n\n2s at (0,0), (0,1), (1,1). So the top row has two 2s, then a 2 in the middle. That could form the top bar and the middle vertical, making a 7. So the output is 7. So the test input's 2s are in the second and third rows, first column. How would that form a 7? It might be a vertical line on the left side, which could be the left part of a 7. But perhaps the 7 is formed when there's a vertical line on the left and a horizontal line at the top. Wait, in the test input, the top row is all zeros. So maybe it's not a 7. Then why is example 5's output 7? Because example 5's 2s are in the top two and middle. Maybe that forms the top horizontal and the middle vertical, which is part of the 7.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is [1] when the 2s form a symmetrical pattern, and [7] otherwise. Example 0 is symmetrical across both diagonals. Example 1 is not. Example 2 is symmetrical vertically and horizontally. Example 3 is symmetrical horizontally. Example 4 is not symmetrical. Example 5 is not. So perhaps symmetry leads to [1], and asymmetry to [7]. Let's check:\n\nExample 0: Symmetrical (cross) \u2192 [1]. Yes.\nExample 1: Not symmetrical \u2192 [7].\nExample 2: Symmetrical (all rows same) \u2192 [1].\nExample 3: Symmetrical (mirror over the middle row) \u2192 [1].\nExample 4: Not symmetrical \u2192 [7].\nExample 5: Not symmetrical \u2192 [7].\n\nIf that's the case, then the test input:\n\n[0,0,0]\n[2,0,0]\n[2,0,0]\n\nLooking at the grid:\nRow 0: 0,0,0\nRow 1:2,0,0\nRow 2:2,0,0\n\nIs this symmetrical? If you mirror it vertically (along the middle column), row 1 and 2's first element would swap, but since they both have 2 in the first column, it's symmetrical vertically. Wait:\n\nOriginal columns:\n\nColumn 0: [0,2,2]\nColumn 1: [0,0,0]\nColumn 2: [0,0,0]\n\nIf mirrored vertically, column 0 becomes column 2, but since columns 1 and 2 are all zeros, the vertical mirror would make columns 0 and 2 swap, which in this case would leave the grid unchanged because columns 0 and 2 are the same (columns 0 has 0,2,2 and column 2 has 0,0,0). Wait no, columns are different. Wait, mirroring the grid vertically would reverse the columns. So the original columns are:\n\nOriginal:\nRow 0: 0 (col0), 0 (col1), 0 (col2)\nRow1:2 (col0),0,0\nRow2:2,0,0\n\nMirrored vertically would be:\n\nRow0:0 (col2),0 (col1),0 (col0) \u2192 0,0,0 (same as original)\nRow1:0 (col2),0,2 \u2192 but original row1 after mirror would be [0,0,2], but original row1 was [2,0,0]. So they are not the same. So the grid is not symmetrical vertically. Similarly, horizontally, if you mirror rows 0 and 2. Original rows 0 and 2 are [0,0,0] and [2,0,0], which are different. So the grid isn't symmetrical in any axis.\n\nTherefore, according to the symmetry hypothesis, the output should be [7]. But let's check the test input's output according to the examples.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is [1] when all 2s are in the same row or column, and [7] otherwise. Example 0: 2s in multiple rows and columns \u2192 output 1. Wait, no. Example 0's 2s are in rows 0,1,2 and columns 0,1,2. So that's not the case. Hmm.\n\nAlternative idea: Maybe the output is [1] if the 2s form a continuous line (like a straight line) and [7] otherwise. For example, example 0's 2s form a cross (two lines), which are straight. Example 2's rows all have 2s at the ends, which are vertical lines? Or maybe horizontal. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the output is [1] when there's an odd number of 2s, and [7] when even. Let's check:\n\nExample 0: 5 2s \u2192 odd \u2192 output 1. Correct.\nExample 1: 3 2s \u2192 odd \u2192 output 7. Doesn't fit.\nSo that's not.\n\nAnother approach: Let's look for binary representations. Maybe each row is converted to a binary number where 2 is 1 and 0 is 0, then combined into a number. For example:\n\nExample 0:\n\nRow0:2,0,2 \u2192 101 (binary) \u2192 5\nRow1:0,2,0 \u2192 010 \u2192 2\nRow2:2,0,2 \u2192 101 \u21925\nTotal sum 5+2+5=12. Not matching output 1.\n\nNot helpful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the number of 2s in each row forms a code. For example:\n\nExample0 has rows with 2, 1, 2 \u2192 sum 5. Output is 1. Doesn't seem to align.\n\nAlternative approach: Maybe the output is based on the positions of the 2s as if they form the digits 1 or 7 in a 3x3 grid. Let's imagine each cell in the grid corresponds to a segment in a 3x3 grid that can display numbers. For example, the digit 1 is represented by the middle vertical line (cells (0,1), (1,1), (2,1)), and the digit 7 is the top row and the middle vertical line. Wait, but example 0's 2s form a cross (middle vertical and horizontal). So perhaps when the middle row and column have 2s, it's a 1. But in example 0, the middle row's center is 2, and the other rows have 2s in the corners.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 1 is formed by having the middle column as 2s. Let's check:\n\nExample0: middle column has 0,2,0. So only the middle cell. Not the entire column. So that's not.\n\nHmm. This is tricky. Let me think of all examples again.\n\nExample 0: Output 1. 2s form a cross (middle row and column). Wait no, because the middle column only has the center 2. The cross is formed by the middle row (all except center?) No, the middle row is [0,2,0], so that's a horizontal line. The vertical line comes from the first and third rows' middle positions. So maybe the cross is the combination of middle row and middle column. But in example0, the middle column has 2 only in the middle row. So the cross is just the center and the four diagonals. Wait, no. The 2s in example0 are:\n\n(0,0), (0,2)\n\n(1,1)\n\n(2,0), (2,2)\n\nSo that's an X shape (diagonals) plus the center. So the cross would be X and + combined. But the output is 1. Maybe not.\n\nExample3 has:\n\nMiddle row: [2,0,2]. So two 2s on the ends. Output is 1. Maybe that's considered a horizontal line in the middle. But the middle cell is 0.\n\nThis is getting confusing. Let's try to find a pattern between the outputs.\n\nLooking at the outputs for examples:\n\nExamples with output [1]: 0, 2, 3.\n\nExamples with output [7]: 1,4,5.\n\nLooking for what's common between the [1] outputs.\n\nExample0: cross/diagonal pattern.\n\nExample2: all rows are [2,0,2]. So the first and third columns have 2s, forming vertical lines.\n\nExample3: middle row has 2s on the ends, other rows are all 0.\n\nSo maybe [1] is when there's either vertical lines, horizontal lines, or cross/diagonal lines. While [7] is when the 2s form a 7-like shape.\n\nThe test input's 2s are in the second and third rows, first column. That's a vertical line on the left. But none of the examples with vertical lines are [1] except perhaps example3, which has a horizontal line.\n\nWait example3's input is:\n\n[0,0,0]\n[2,0,2]\n[0,0,0]\n\nWhich is a horizontal line in the middle row. Output is 1.\n\nExample2's input is three rows of vertical lines on the ends. Output is 1.\n\nSo vertical lines (example2) and horizontal lines (example3) lead to output 1. While 7-shaped (example1,4,5) lead to output7.\n\nTest input's 2s are a vertical line in the first column of the second and third rows. So like two cells in the first column. Does that form a vertical line? If a vertical line (even partial) leads to output 1, then test input's output should be 1. But looking at example1, which has a vertical line in the first column (two cells) and another cell in the third row, leading to output7.\n\nSo perhaps a vertical line with two cells and another cell in a different position forms 7, while a full vertical line (like example2's vertical lines on the ends) would be 1.\n\nBut the test input's vertical line is in the first column but only two cells (rows 1 and 2). Example1 has a vertical line in the first column (rows 0 and 1), plus a cell in row2, column1. So maybe the test input's pattern is similar to example5. Let's look at example5:\n\nExample5 input:\n[2,2,0]\n[0,2,0]\n[0,0,0]\n\n2s are in (0,0), (0,1), (1,1). So the top row has two 2s and the middle cell. This could form the top bar and the middle vertical, like a 7.\n\nThe test input's 2s are in (1,0) and (2,0). So vertical line in column0, rows1 and2. Maybe that's considered part of a 7's shape. For example, the vertical line on the left (like the left stroke of a 7) but no top bar. Wait, but the top bar is missing. Hmm. But example5's test case has a vertical line on the left in column0 only in the first row, but then example5's output is 7. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 7 is formed by two connected parts: a horizontal top and a diagonal or vertical line. In the test input, there's no horizontal top. But perhaps the left vertical line (two cells) plus another 2 somewhere else. But the test input's 2s are only in the first column of the second and third rows. So that's just two cells. How does that form a 7?\n\nAlternatively, the output is [7] when the 2s form an \"L\" shape, like the vertical and then a horizontal, but in the test input, it's a vertical line of two cells. Maybe that's not an L.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the number of 2s is 2, and that's even, so output 7. Let's check examples:\n\nTest input has two 2s. Example0 has 5 (output1), example1 has 3 (7), example2 has 6 (output1), example3 has 2 (output1). Wait no, example3 has two 2s and outputs 1. So count doesn't matter.\n\nHmm. This is really challenging. Let me try to find another angle.\n\nLooking at the positions of 2s in examples that output 1 and 7:\n\nOutput1 examples:\n\nExample0: positions (0,0), (0,2), (1,1), (2,0), (2,2)\nExample2: positions (0,0), (0,2), (1,0), (1,2), (2,0), (2,2)\nExample3: positions (1,0), (1,2)\n\nOutput7 examples:\n\nExample1: (0,0), (1,0), (2,1)\nExample4: (0,0), (0,1), (1,1), (1,2)\nExample5: (0,0), (0,1), (1,1)\n\nLooking for a pattern. For output1, the 2s are either in symmetric positions (like corners and center) or in a horizontal line. For output7, the 2s form a shape that could resemble a 7.\n\nMaybe the key is to check if the positions of the 2s match the segments of a seven-segment display arranged in a 3x3 grid. Let's imagine:\n\nSuppose the seven segments are arranged as follows in the 3x3 grid:\n\n- a: top horizontal (row0, columns0-2)\n- b: upper right vertical (row0-col2, row1-col2)\n- c: lower right vertical (row1-col2, row2-col2)\n- d: middle horizontal (row1, columns0-2)\n- e: lower left vertical (row2-col0, row1-col0)\n- f: upper left vertical (row0-col0, row1-col0)\n- g: bottom horizontal (row2, columns0-2)\n\nBut this is just a guess. For the number 1, the segments b and c are lit (right verticals). For 7, segments a, b, and c are lit (top and right verticals).\n\nBut let's see example0's 2s. If the 2s are in the corners and center, maybe that's not fitting any number. Alternatively, maybe it's a different arrangement.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is [1] when all 2s are located in the center or form a cross, and [7] when they form a specific pattern. But I'm not sure.\n\nAnother Idea: The output is [1] when the grid has a certain kind of symmetry (like rotational or reflection), and [7] otherwise. For example:\n\nExample0: has symmetry along both diagonals and the center. Output1.\n\nExample1: No symmetry. Output7.\n\nExample2: All rows are same, vertical symmetry. Output1.\n\nExample3: Middle row is symmetric, vertical symmetry. Output1.\n\nExample4: Not symmetric. Output7.\n\nExample5: Not symmetric. Output7.\n\nTest Input:\n\nRows:\n[0,0,0]\n[2,0,0]\n[2,0,0]\n\nThis grid is symmetric along the vertical axis if we mirror columns. Let's see: column0 is [0,2,2], column1 is [0,0,0], column2 is [0,0,0]. If we swap columns 0 and 2, it becomes [0,0,0], [0,0,2], [0,0,2]. Which is different from original. So no vertical symmetry.\n\nBut the rows are:\n\nRow0: all zeros.\n\nRow1 and 2: both have 2 in column0. So they are the same. So there's horizontal symmetry between rows1 and 2. But row0 is different.\n\nSo maybe this grid has symmetry between rows1 and 2. Would that make it symmetrical in some way and hence output1? But example5's rows are:\n\n[2,2,0]\n\n[0,2,0]\n\n[0,0,0]\n\nRows0 and 1 are different. So perhaps the symmetry between rows1 and 2 in the test input leads to output1. But according to example3, which has symmetry between rows0 and 2 (both all zeros), and the middle row is symmetric, output is 1. So maybe any symmetry leads to output1.\n\nIn the test input, the first row is all zeros, the other two rows are [2,0,0]. So there's symmetry between rows1 and 2. So according to that hypothesis, the output should be [1]. But example5's input has no symmetry between rows, so output is7.\n\nBut example1's input:\n\nRow0: [2,0,0]\n\nRow1: [2,0,0]\n\nRow2: [0,2,0]\n\nRows0 and1 are same, row2 is different. So there's symmetry between rows0 and1. But output is7. Which contradicts the hypothesis. So symmetry is not the key.\n\nAnother Idea: The output is [1] if the 2s are arranged in such a way that they form a continuous region connected either horizontally or vertically, and [7] otherwise. For example, example0's 2s are connected via diagonals. Example2's 2s are vertical lines. Example3's 2s are in a horizontal line. All of these outputs are 1. Example1's 2s are three disconnected points (two in column0 and one in (2,1)), which forms a 7. Example4's 2s are connected in a diagonal and horizontal line. Example5's 2s are connected in a T-shape. But this doesn't clearly align.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is determined by the number of connected components of 2s. But example0 has one connected component (if diagonals are considered connected), output1. Example1 has two connected components (the vertical line and the single cell), output7. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the output is [1] when there's exactly one 'island' of 2s, and [7] when there are multiple. But example5's 2s are connected, so one island. But output is7. So that's not.\n\nAt this point, I'm stuck. Maybe I should look for a different approach. Let's consider the examples again.\n\nExample0: cross/diagonals \u21921.\n\nExample1: 2s in left column and middle of third row \u21927.\n\nExample2: vertical lines on both ends \u21921.\n\nExample3: horizontal line in middle \u21921.\n\nExample4: diagonal and another diagonal \u21927.\n\nExample5: top row and middle \u21927.\n\nSo what's the difference between 1 and7?\n\nMaybe it's the presence of a diagonal. Examples with diagonals might output7. For example, example4 and5 have diagonal 2s, output7. Example0 has diagonals but also a cross, output1. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, the output is [1] when the 2s form a closed shape, but that doesn't fit.\n\nAnother Idea: Let's consider the 3x3 grid as a number pad:\n\n1 2 3\n\n4 5 6\n\n7 8 9\n\nThen, the positions of the 2s correspond to the digits in the output.\n\nBut example0's 2s are at positions (0,0)=1, (0,2)=3, (1,1)=5, (2,0)=7, (2,2)=9. The output is [1], but there are multiple numbers here. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, sum the numbers where 2s are present. Example0: 1+3+5+7+9=25. Output is 1. Doesn't match.\n\nAlternatively, the product modulo 10: 1*3*5*7*9=945 \u2192 5 mod 10. Not 1.\n\nHmm.\n\nAnother Idea: Maybe the output corresponds to the number of enclosed areas formed by the 2s. For example, the digit 1 has no enclosed areas, 7 has none. So that's not it.\n\nAlternatively, the number of corners occupied by 2s. Example0 has four corners ( (0,0), (0,2), (2,0), (2,2)) \u21924 corners. Output1. Example1 has (0,0) corner. Output7. Example2 has all four corners. Output1. Example3 has none. Output1. Example4 has (0,0). Output7. Example5 has (0,0). Output7. Test input has no corners. So output1? But the test input's output would then be [1]. But according to the previous examples, having no corners could be output1. For example, example3's input has no corners (2s are in middle row's ends). Output1. But test input has no corners. So according to this, output1. But in example5, there is a corner (0,0), output7. So maybe the output is [1] when there are even number of corners (including zero) and [7] when odd. Example0: 4 corners (even) \u21921. Example1:1 (odd) \u21927. Example2:4 \u21921. Example3:0 \u21921. Example4:1 \u21927. Example5:1 \u21927. Test input:0 corners (even) \u21921. So this would predict the test output is [1]. But according to example3, zero corners \u2192 output1. So the test input would be [1].\n\nBut let's check the test input's corners: (0,0) is 0, (0,2) is0, (2,0) is2, (2,2) is0. So (2,0) is a corner. But in the test input, the 2s are at (1,0) and (2,0). So (2,0) is a corner. So the number of corners with 2 is 1. Which is odd. So according to the corner hypothesis, output should be7.\n\nWait, example3's 2s are at (1,0) and (1,2). (1,0) is not a corner. Corners are the four positions (0,0), (0,2), (2,0), (2,2). So example3 has zero corners with 2s. So output1.\n\nTest input has (2,0) as a corner with 2. So one corner. According to the hypothesis, output7. Let's check examples:\n\nExample0: 4 corners \u21921.\n\nExample1:1 corner (0,0) \u21927.\n\nExample2:4 corners \u21921.\n\nExample3:0 \u21921.\n\nExample4: (0,0) is a corner \u21927.\n\nExample5: (0,0) \u21927.\n\nSo if the number of corners with 2s is odd \u21927, even \u21921. Then test input has 1 corner (2,0) \u2192 output7.\n\nBut according to example3, zero corners (even) \u21921. So this hypothesis holds.\n\nSo applying this to the test input:\n\nTest input's 2s are at (1,0) and (2,0). The corners are:\n\n(0,0) \u21920\n\n(0,2) \u21920\n\n(2,0) \u21922 \u2192 one corner.\n\nSo number of corners with 2 is 1 (odd). Therefore, output is7.\n\nSo the final answer should be [7]."
