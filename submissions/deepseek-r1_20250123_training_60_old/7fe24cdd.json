        "cot_1": "Okay, let's see. I need to figure out the pattern from the training examples and apply it to the test input. Let's start by looking at the first example.\n\nIn Example 0, the input is three rows of three numbers each. The output is six rows of six numbers. So the output is bigger. Let's check how each input row is transformed into the output rows.\n\nLooking at the first input row [8,5,0], the output first row is [8,5,0,0,8,8]. Hmm, so the original elements are followed by 0,8,8. Wait, maybe it's mirrored with some additions? Let me check the next output row: [8,5,3,3,5,5]. The input here was [8,5,3]. So again, the original three elements are followed by 3,5,5. Then the third input row [0,3,2] becomes [0,3,2,2,3,0]. So after the original, it's 2,3,0. Then the next rows in the output are repetitions or transformations of the input rows.\n\nWait, maybe the output is constructed by taking each row of the input and creating two rows each, but how? Let me see the structure. The input has 3 rows, output has 6. So each input row generates two output rows. But how?\n\nLooking at the first example's output rows:\n\nRow 0: [8,5,0,0,8,8] \u2013 original row is first three elements. The next three elements are 0,8,8. Where do these come from? The original row's third element is 0, then the first element 8, then first again 8? Not sure.\n\nRow 1: [8,5,3,3,5,5] \u2013 input was [8,5,3]. The next three elements are 3,5,5. Third element of input is 3, then second 5, then second again 5? Hmm.\n\nRow 2: [0,3,2,2,3,0] \u2013 input [0,3,2], next elements 2,3,0. That's reverse of the input? 2,3,0 is the reverse of [0,3,2] but starting from the third element. Wait, no, the original is [0,3,2], reversed would be [2,3,0]. So the next three elements here are exactly the reversed original. Then row 3 is the same as row 2, but maybe transformed again?\n\nRow 3: [0,3,2,2,3,0] \u2013 same as row 2. Then rows 4 and 5: [5,5,3,3,5,8] and [8,8,0,0,5,8]. Hmm, maybe these are transformations of other rows, but rotated or something.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is a combination of the original rows and their transformations, arranged in a specific order. Let's consider how the 3x3 input becomes 6x6 output. Perhaps each input row is processed into two output rows, and each column is also processed similarly. Or maybe it's a reflection or rotation.\n\nAlternatively, let's think of the output as a 6x6 grid formed by arranging transformed versions of the input matrix. Let me look for a possible matrix operation. For example, the input is a 3x3 matrix, and the output is a 6x6 matrix constructed by some mirroring or concatenation.\n\nLooking at the first example's output:\n\nOriginal input rows are the first three elements of the first three output rows. Then the next three elements in each row could be derived from other parts. Wait, maybe the output is the original matrix and its transformations arranged in a 2x2 grid, but expanded.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each row in the input is mirrored or reversed and concatenated with some other elements. For example, in the first output row [8,5,0,0,8,8], after the original [8,5,0], the next three elements are 0,8,8. The 0 is the third element of the input row. Then 8 is the first element of the input row, and another 8. Not sure.\n\nLooking at the second example's input [3,8,2] gives output row [3,8,2,8,3,3]. The added elements are 8,3,3. The original row's elements are 3,8,2. The added elements are 8 (second element), 3 (first element), and 3 again. Hmm, maybe the added elements are the original row's elements in some order, perhaps reversed or shifted.\n\nWait, the first added element after the original row is the third element of the original row. Then maybe some pattern. Let's check:\n\nFor example 0, first input row [8,5,0] \u2192 output row [8,5,0,0,8,8]. The added elements are 0 (third element of input row), then 8 (first element), then 8 again. So it's third, first, first.\n\nSecond input row [8,5,3] \u2192 output row [8,5,3,3,5,5]. Added elements: 3 (third), 5 (second), 5 (second). So third, second, second.\n\nThird input row [0,3,2] \u2192 output row [0,3,2,2,3,0]. Added elements: 2 (third), 3 (second), 0 (first). So third, second, first. Which is the reverse of the original row.\n\nHmm, this is inconsistent. So maybe the added part after the original three elements in each row depends on some other pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking each input row and appending a modified version of itself, then stacking modified versions of the entire matrix.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each row of the input is used to generate two rows in the output. Let's check the first example's output:\n\nOriginal input rows are 3. The output has 6 rows. So each input row contributes two output rows. Let's see:\n\nIn example 0:\n\nInput row 0: [8,5,0] \u2192 output row 0: [8,5,0,0,8,8], output row 5: [8,8,0,0,5,8]\n\nWait, row 5 starts with 8,8,0, which could be a transformed version. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each input row is mirrored and then combined with other transformations. Let me take the first input row's output in example 0: [8,5,0,0,8,8]. The first three elements are the original, the next three are 0,8,8. So 0 is the third element, then 8 (first element), then 8 again. So maybe the third element, then first element twice.\n\nThe second input row [8,5,3] \u2192 output row 1: [8,5,3,3,5,5]. The added elements are 3,5,5. Third element, then second element twice.\n\nThird input row [0,3,2] \u2192 output row 2: [0,3,2,2,3,0]. Added elements are 2,3,0. Which is the reverse of the original row.\n\nSo the pattern for the first three elements of each output row is the original input row. The next three elements vary. Let's see:\n\nRow 0: third, first, first.\n\nRow 1: third, second, second.\n\nRow 2: third, second, first (reverse).\n\nThen in the output, rows 3,4,5 are other transformations. For example, row 3 is the same as row 2. Row 4: [5,5,3,3,5,8]. Hmm, perhaps this is a transformed version of the second input row. Or maybe a rotation or reflection.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the entire 3x3 input matrix is transformed into a 6x6 matrix by tiling, flipping, or combining with other matrices. For example, perhaps the output is formed by placing the original matrix, its vertical flip, its horizontal flip, and its rotated version in a 2x2 grid, then each row is concatenated.\n\nBut looking at the output rows, they are 6 elements each. Let's think of the output as a 6x6 matrix. The input is 3x3. So maybe each element in the input is expanded into a 2x2 block in the output. But how?\n\nAlternatively, the output could be a combination of the original matrix and its transformations. For example:\n\nOriginal matrix A, then mirrored A', then perhaps another transformation.\n\nBut this is vague. Let me look at another example. Take Example 1:\n\nInput is:\n\n[3,8,2]\n\n[3,2,2]\n\n[8,5,2]\n\nThe output has six rows. Let's check the first output row: [3,8,2,8,3,3]. The original row is first three elements, then 8,3,3. The third element of the input row is 2, so the first added element is 8 (second element of the input row?), then 3 (first element?), then 3 again. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the added elements for row 0 of example 1: 8,3,3. The original row is [3,8,2]. The added elements are 8 (second element), 3 (first element), 3 (first again). So maybe for the first part of the output, the added elements are the second, first, first elements of the original row.\n\nBut in example 0, first row's added elements were 0 (third), 8 (first), 8 (first). So not consistent.\n\nAnother approach: perhaps the output is the original matrix concatenated with its rotated or flipped version. Let's check the first example's output. The first three output rows might be the original rows with some appended data, and the next three rows are transformations.\n\nAlternatively, the output could be the input matrix followed by its mirror image horizontally and vertically, but this is not clear.\n\nWait, in example 0, the output has rows 0 and 5 that start with 8 and end with 8. The original input's first element was 8. Maybe there's a symmetry here.\n\nAnother angle: Let's look at the entire output matrix structure. For example 0's output:\n\nRow 0: [8,5,0,0,8,8]\n\nRow 1: [8,5,3,3,5,5]\n\nRow 2: [0,3,2,2,3,0]\n\nRow 3: same as row 2.\n\nRow 4: [5,5,3,3,5,8]\n\nRow 5: [8,8,0,0,5,8]\n\nLooking at rows 0 and 5: the first three elements of row 0 are [8,5,0], and the first three of row 5 are [8,8,0]. The last three elements of row 5 are [0,5,8], which is the reverse of row 0's first three elements. Maybe there's a circular pattern here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by creating a larger matrix where each row is a combination of the original rows and their rotated or mirrored versions. For instance, each row in the output could be a combination of two input rows.\n\nBut I'm not making progress. Let's try a different approach. Let's see if the output is formed by taking each element in the input and applying some rule. For example, each element in the input is used to generate two elements in the output. But the input is 3x3, output 6x6. So 3x3 becomes 6x6, which is (3*2)x(3*2). So each element could map to a 2x2 block. How?\n\nLooking at example 0's input:\n\n[8,5,0]\n\n[8,5,3]\n\n[0,3,2]\n\nThe output's first two rows:\n\n[8,5,0,0,8,8]\n\n[8,5,3,3,5,5]\n\nIf each input element generates a 2x2 block, let's see:\n\nFor input[0][0] = 8: in the output's first two rows and first two columns, maybe 8,5; 8,5. But not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is constructed by tiling the input matrix in a certain way. For example, the upper-left 3x3 is the original, then the upper-right is a flipped version, lower-left and lower-right are other transformations.\n\nBut looking at example 0's output first row: [8,5,0,0,8,8]. The first three elements are the original first row, then the next three are 0,8,8. The 0 comes from the original third element of the first input row. Then 8,8: perhaps the first element of the first input row twice. Then the second output row is [8,5,3,3,5,5]. The first three elements are the second input row, then 3 (third element), 5 (second), 5 (second). So maybe the pattern for the first three output rows is: take the original row, then append elements based on some rule.\n\nRule for the first three output rows (rows 0,1,2):\n\nAfter the original row, append third element, then first element, then first element again. For row 0, original [8,5,0] \u2192 append 0,8,8. But row 1, original [8,5,3] \u2192 append 3,5,5. Wait, third element is 3, but then 5 (second element?), then 5. So maybe different per row.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's based on the column. For example, the first three rows of the output correspond to the original rows, and the next three elements in each row are derived from the elements in the same column of the input.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each row in the output is built by concatenating the original row with a modified version. For example:\n\nRow 0: [8,5,0] + [0,8,8] \u2192 the modified part could be [0,8,8]. 0 is the third element of the original row, then 8 is the first element, and 8 again. So third, first, first.\n\nRow 1: [8,5,3] + [3,5,5]. Third element 3, then 5 (second element), 5 (second). So third, second, second.\n\nRow 2: [0,3,2] + [2,3,0]. Third, second, first. Which is the reverse of the original row.\n\nSo the pattern for the first three output rows seems to be: take the original row, then append a new triplet. The triplet is formed as [third element of the row, some element, some element]. The pattern for the triplet varies:\n\nRow 0: third, first, first.\n\nRow 1: third, second, second.\n\nRow 2: third, second, first.\n\nBut why? There's inconsistency here. Maybe the triplet depends on the row's position. For example, row 0 (first row) uses third, first, first; row 1 (second row) uses third, second, second; row 2 (third row) uses third, second, first (reverse). Then for rows 3,4,5, perhaps they are transformations of the input rows in reverse order or something.\n\nLooking at the fourth row in example 0's output: [5,5,3,3,5,8]. The first three elements are 5,5,3. This could be the second input row's elements in reverse, but with duplication. The second input row was [8,5,3]. Reverse would be [3,5,8], but here it's [5,5,3]. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the lower three rows of the output are generated by taking the original rows in reverse order and applying similar transformations. Let's check example 0's row 4: [5,5,3,3,5,8]. The original rows in reverse order are [0,3,2], [8,5,3], [8,5,0]. So row 4 could be derived from the second original row [8,5,3]. If we take that row's elements, maybe the triplet is 3,5,5 (third, second, second), which is the same as row 1's appended triplet. But in row 4, the first three elements are 5,5,3. Maybe it's reversed or modified.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Let me try another approach. Maybe the output is a combination of the original matrix and its transpose, or some rotation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is a 2x2 block matrix where each block is a modified version of the input. For example, the output matrix could be:\n\n[A B\n\n C D]\n\nWhere A is the original matrix, B is a transformed version, C is another transformation, D is yet another. Then each block is 3x3, but the output is 6x6. However, in the examples, the output rows are 6 elements long, so perhaps each block is 3x3, but arranged in a way that makes each row of the output a combination of rows from the blocks.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each row of the output is a combination of two input rows. For example, the first three elements of row 0 are the first input row, and the next three are a modified version of the third input row. But not sure.\n\nLooking at example 0's row 0: [8,5,0,0,8,8]. The first three are the first input row. The next three are 0,8,8. 0 is from the third element of the first input row. Then 8 from the first element of the first input row. Maybe the next three elements are derived from the third element of the same input row, then the first element, then the first element again. So for the first input row, the appended elements are third, first, first.\n\nSecond input row's appended elements are third, second, second.\n\nThird input row's appended elements are third, second, first (reverse).\n\nBut why the pattern changes? Maybe based on the row index. For row 0 (index 0), it's third, first, first. For row 1 (index 1), third, second, second. For row 2 (index 2), third, second, first. Then rows 3,4,5 would be based on the reversed rows or other transformations.\n\nFor example, row 3 in example 0's output is the same as row 2. Then row 4 is [5,5,3,3,5,8]. The first three elements are 5,5,3. That's the second input row's elements [8,5,3] transformed. Maybe reversed and modified. The third input row is [0,3,2], reversed is [2,3,0]. But row 4 starts with 5,5,3. Not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is constructed by mirroring the input rows and columns. For example, the first half of the output is the original matrix with appended mirrored versions, and the second half is the mirrored matrix with appended versions.\n\nAnother idea: looking at the output of example 0, the first three rows are the original input rows each with an appended triplet. The next three rows are similar but transformed in a different way. Let's compare the fourth row: [5,5,3,3,5,8]. The first three elements are 5,5,3. This could be the second input row [8,5,3] with elements modified: 5,5,3. So the first element becomes 5 (second element of the original row?), then 5 again, then 3 (third element). Not clear.\n\nAlternatively, the fourth row's first three elements are 5,5,3. The second input row was [8,5,3]. Maybe take the second element twice and then the third. So 5,5,3. Then the appended triplet is 3,5,8. Which is the third element, second element, first element of the second input row. So for the fourth row, the first three elements are 5,5,3 and the next three are 3,5,8. Which is the reverse of the second input row. So maybe the fourth row is made up of the second input row's elements in reverse order, but with some duplication.\n\nBut this is getting too vague. Let's try to find a pattern for the first three output rows of each example and see if there's a common rule.\n\nTake example 0's first three output rows:\n\nRow0: [8,5,0,0,8,8] \u2192 original [8,5,0], appended [0,8,8]\n\nRow1: [8,5,3,3,5,5] \u2192 original [8,5,3], appended [3,5,5]\n\nRow2: [0,3,2,2,3,0] \u2192 original [0,3,2], appended [2,3,0]\n\nThe appended parts are:\n\nRow0: [0,8,8] \u2192 third, first, first\n\nRow1: [3,5,5] \u2192 third, second, second\n\nRow2: [2,3,0] \u2192 third, second, first (reverse of original)\n\nThis seems to follow a pattern where for the first row of the input (row0), the appended part is third, first, first. For the second row (row1), third, second, second. For the third row (row2), third, second, first. So perhaps the appended part depends on the row index.\n\nThen, the next three rows (rows3,4,5) of the output might be transformations of the input rows in reverse order. For example, row3 is the same as row2's appended part but maybe transformed again. But in example0, row3 is the same as row2.\n\nLooking at example1's first three output rows:\n\nRow0: [3,8,2,8,3,3] \u2192 appended [8,3,3]. Original row [3,8,2]. Third element is 2, but appended part is 8,3,3. Wait, that doesn't fit the previous pattern. Because third element is 2, but appended part starts with 8. So this contradicts the earlier idea.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the appended part for row0 is the second element, first element, first element. For example, original row0 in example1 is [3,8,2]. Appended [8,3,3], which is second, first, first. Then row1 is [3,2,2,5,2,8]. Appended part [5,2,8]. Original row1 is [3,2,2]. Third element is 2. But appended part starts with 5. Hmm, this doesn't fit.\n\nWait, maybe the appended parts are derived from a different row. For example, in example1's row0, appended part is [8,3,3]. The 8 could be from the second element of row0, then 3 from the first element of row0. Then 3 again. But then where does the 5 in row1's appended part come from?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the appended part is taken from another row. For example, row0's appended part in example1 is [8,3,3]. 8 is from the second element of row0. Then 3 is from row0's first element, then 3 again. So same as before.\n\nBut then for row1 in example1, original row1 is [3,2,2]. Appended part is [5,2,8]. Where does 5 come from? The input's third row is [8,5,2]. Maybe the 5 is taken from that row's second element. Then 2 from row1's third element, and 8 from the third row's first element. That seems too arbitrary.\n\nThis approach isn't working. Let's try to look at the entire output matrix structure.\n\nIn example0, the output is 6x6. Let's imagine it as a combination of four 3x3 blocks arranged in a 2x2 grid. For example:\n\nBlock1 | Block2\n\nBlock3 | Block4\n\nEach block is a transformation of the original input.\n\nLooking at example0's output:\n\nRow0: 8,5,0,0,8,8\n\nRow1:8,5,3,3,5,5\n\nRow2:0,3,2,2,3,0\n\nRow3:0,3,2,2,3,0\n\nRow4:5,5,3,3,5,8\n\nRow5:8,8,0,0,5,8\n\nIf we split into four 3x3 blocks:\n\nBlock1 (rows0-2, cols0-2):\n\n[8,5,0]\n\n[8,5,3]\n\n[0,3,2]\n\nThis is the original input.\n\nBlock2 (rows0-2, cols3-5):\n\n[0,8,8]\n\n[3,5,5]\n\n[2,3,0]\n\nBlock3 (rows3-5, cols0-2):\n\n[0,3,2]\n\n[5,5,3]\n\n[8,8,0]\n\nBlock4 (rows3-5, cols3-5):\n\n[2,3,0]\n\n[3,5,8]\n\n[0,5,8]\n\nHmm, Block2 looks like a transformed version of the original input. For example, the first row of Block2 is [0,8,8]. The original first row's third element is 0, then first element 8. Second row of Block2 is [3,5,5], which is third element 3, then 5, 5 (second element of original second row). Third row of Block2 is [2,3,0], which is the reverse of original third row.\n\nBlock3's first row is same as original third row. Second row [5,5,3] is perhaps the original second row's elements [8,5,3] transformed. Third row [8,8,0] is original first row's elements [8,5,0] with 8,8,0.\n\nBlock4's first row is [2,3,0] (reverse of original third row), second row [3,5,8] (third element 3, second 5, first 8 of original second row), third row [0,5,8] (third element 0 of original first row, then 5, 8).\n\nThis seems too varied to find a pattern. Perhaps each block is a different transformation of the input, like original, flipped, reversed, etc.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each row of the output is generated by combining two input rows in some way. For example, the first three output rows are derived from the original input rows, and the next three are derived from the original rows in reverse order or with some modification.\n\nBut even this is not clear. Let's try to find another pattern.\n\nLooking at example0's output rows 0 and 5:\n\nRow0: [8,5,0,0,8,8]\n\nRow5: [8,8,0,0,5,8]\n\nNotice that the last three elements of row0 are 0,8,8, and the first three of row5 are 8,8,0. They seem related. Maybe there's a diagonal symmetry.\n\nAnother idea: The output could be constructed by rotating the input matrix and concatenating. For example, the original matrix is 3x3, then rotated 180 degrees and appended. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the output is formed by concatenating the original matrix with its mirror image along the vertical or horizontal axis. For example, vertically concatenating the original and its vertical flip. But the output has 6 rows, so each row is original and flipped.\n\nBut example0's output has rows0-2 as original, then rows3-5 as something else. For example, row3 is same as row2. Row4 is new. Row5 is new.\n\nAnother angle: Let's look at the elements in the output matrix. For example, in example0's output, the first column of the output is [8,8,0,0,5,8]. The first three elements are the first column of the input, and the next three elements are [0,5,8], which is the third column of the input reversed. Wait, input's third column is [0,3,2]. Reversed is [2,3,0]. Doesn't match.\n\nAlternatively, the first column of the output is [8,8,0,0,5,8]. The first three are from the first column of input, then [0,5,8] which are from the third column of input [0,3,2] transformed to 0,5,8. Not sure.\n\nThis is really challenging. Let's try to focus on the test input and see if applying a possible pattern can help.\n\nTest input:\n\n[2,5,0]\n\n[2,5,1]\n\n[3,1,1]\n\nWe need to generate a 6x6 output.\n\nAssuming the pattern from the examples, each input row generates two output rows, possibly with some transformations.\n\nLooking at example0's first row:\n\nInput row0: [8,5,0] \u2192 output row0: [8,5,0,0,8,8]\n\nSo appended triplet is third, first, first.\n\nTest input's first row is [2,5,0]. Following the same pattern, appended triplet would be 0,2,2. So output row0 would be [2,5,0,0,2,2].\n\nThen example0's row1 is [8,5,3,3,5,5], so for test input's second row [2,5,1], appended triplet would be 1,5,5. So row1 would be [2,5,1,1,5,5].\n\nThird input row [3,1,1]. According to example0's third row, which appended the reverse of the original, so appended triplet would be 1,1,3. So row2 would be [3,1,1,1,1,3].\n\nThen the next three rows could be transformations. For example, row3 might be same as row2. Then row4 could be based on the second input row reversed, perhaps. For example, [5,5,1,1,5,2]. But I'm not sure.\n\nBut how to handle rows 3-5? In example0, rows3-5 were:\n\n[0,3,2,2,3,0]\n\n[5,5,3,3,5,8]\n\n[8,8,0,0,5,8]\n\nSo row3 is same as row2. Then row4 starts with 5,5,3. Which might be the second input row's elements modified. The second input row was [8,5,3], so perhaps taking the second element (5), then 5,3. So for test input's second row [2,5,1], row4 might start with 5,5,1. Then the appended triplet could be 1,5,2. So row4 would be [5,5,1,1,5,2].\n\nRow5 in example0 is [8,8,0,0,5,8], which seems like the first input row's elements modified. So for test input, row5 could be [2,2,0,0,5,2].\n\nPutting it all together for the test input:\n\nRow0: [2,5,0,0,2,2]\n\nRow1: [2,5,1,1,5,5]\n\nRow2: [3,1,1,1,1,3]\n\nRow3: [3,1,1,1,1,3]\n\nRow4: [5,5,1,1,5,2]\n\nRow5: [2,2,0,0,5,2]\n\nBut I'm not confident. Let's check if this fits the pattern seen in the examples.\n\nIn example1, the first three output rows were:\n\n[3,8,2,8,3,3]\n\n[3,2,2,5,2,8]\n\n[8,5,2,2,2,2]\n\nThen rows3-5:\n\n[2,2,2,2,5,8]\n\n[8,2,5,2,2,3]\n\n[3,3,8,2,8,3]\n\nSo for row0 of example1: input row0 is [3,8,2], appended triplet is [8,3,3] which is second, first, first. Which aligns with what I thought earlier.\n\nSo the pattern for appended triplet depends on the row index. For row0, it's third, first, first in example0, but second, first, first in example1. Hmm, this inconsistency complicates things.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the appended triplet is determined by taking certain elements from the same row and other rows. For example, in example0's row0, appended elements are third element of own row, first element of own row, first element of own row. In example1's row0, appended elements are second element of own row, first element of own row, first element of own row. So there's no consistency here.\n\nPerhaps the pattern is that the appended triplet is formed by the second element, first element, first element of the same row. But in example0's row0, it's third element, first, first. So maybe that's not the case.\n\nThis is very confusing. Another idea: maybe the appended triplet is the same as the original row but modified in a certain way, such as rotated or shifted.\n\nFor example0's row0: [8,5,0] \u2192 appended [0,8,8]. So shifted right by two, then elements duplicated.\n\nBut example0's row1: [8,5,3] \u2192 [3,5,5]. Shift right by two, then duplicate the second element.\n\nExample0's row2: [0,3,2] \u2192 [2,3,0]. Reversed.\n\nExample1's row0: [3,8,2] \u2192 [8,3,3]. Maybe shifted right by one, then duplicated first element.\n\nExample1's row1: [3,2,2] \u2192 [5,2,8]. Where do 5 and 8 come from? Maybe from other rows. This suggests that the appended triplet is derived from other rows, not the same row.\n\nThis makes it even more complicated.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and lack of clarity, I'll try to proceed with the initial hypothesis for the test input. Based on example0, the first three rows are the input rows each with an appended triplet. Then the next three rows are transformations of the input rows in reverse order. So for the test input:\n\nFirst three output rows:\n\n[2,5,0,0,2,2]\n\n[2,5,1,1,5,5]\n\n[3,1,1,1,1,3]\n\nThen rows3-5 would be transformations of the input rows reversed or something.\n\nRow3: [3,1,1,1,1,3] (same as row2)\n\nRow4: Maybe based on the second input row reversed. Original second row [2,5,1] reversed is [1,5,2]. Appended triplet could be 5,5,2. So row4: [1,5,2,5,5,2]. But this doesn't fit the example structure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps row4 is the second input row transformed: [2,5,1] becomes [5,5,1,1,5,2].\n\nRow5: [2,2,0,0,5,2]. This would be based on the first input row [2,5,0] transformed.\n\nBut this is guesswork. Looking at example0's row5: [8,8,0,0,5,8]. This seems to be the first input row with elements 8,8,0, then 0,5,8. The first three elements are [8,8,0], which is the first input row's elements with first element duplicated and third element. The next three are [0,5,8], which is third, second, first of the first input row. So for test input row5: [2,2,0,0,5,2]. First three elements 2,2,0 (first element duplicated, third element). Next three 0,5,2 (third, second, first of the first input row).\n\nThis seems possible.\n\nPutting it all together for the test input:\n\nOutput would be:\n\n[2,5,0,0,2,2]\n\n[2,5,1,1,5,5]\n\n[3,1,1,1,1,3]\n\n[3,1,1,1,1,3]\n\n[5,5,1,1,5,2]\n\n[2,2,0,0,5,2]\n\nThis follows the pattern where each of the first three rows are the input rows with appended triplets, the fourth row is the same as the third, the fifth row is based on the second input row, and the sixth row based on the first input row.\n\nBut in example0's row4: [5,5,3,3,5,8], which is based on the second input row [8,5,3], transformed into 5,5,3 and appended with 3,5,8. For the test input's second row [2,5,1], this would become 5,5,1 and appended with 1,5,2. So row4: [5,5,1,1,5,2].\n\nSimilarly, row5: [2,2,0,0,5,2] would be based on the first input row [2,5,0], transformed into 2,2,0 and appended with 0,5,2.\n\nThis matches the pattern in example0's row5.\n\nSo applying this pattern to the test input, the final output would be as I outlined above.",

        "cot_2": "Okay, let's tackle this puzzle. The goal is to figure out the pattern that transforms the input matrices into the output matrices. Let's start by carefully analyzing the training examples to identify any recurring patterns or rules.\n\nLooking at Example 0:\n\nInput is three rows:\n[8,5,0]\n[8,5,3]\n[0,3,2]\n\nOutput is six rows. So the output matrix is twice the size of the input in both dimensions. Let's see how each input row is transformed into two output rows. Wait, the input is 3x3, and the output is 6x6. So each input element might be generating a 2x2 block in the output. That's a common approach in such puzzles.\n\nLet's check the first input row [8,5,0]. The first two output rows are [8,5,0,0,8,8] and [8,5,3,3,5,5]. Hmm, not sure yet. Wait, maybe the output is a combination of the original matrix and some transformations, like rotations or reflections.\n\nAnother approach: Look at the output rows. The first three rows of the output might be the original rows with some elements added. For example, the first output row of Example 0 is [8,5,0,0,8,8]. The original first row is [8,5,0], then followed by 0,8,8. Wait, where do these numbers come from?\n\nAlternatively, maybe each row in the output is a combination of elements from the input matrix in a certain pattern. Let's see the structure.\n\nIn Example 0, the output has six rows. Let's think of the output as a 6x6 matrix. Let's split it into 3x3 blocks. For example, maybe the first three rows are the original matrix mirrored or transformed, and the next three rows are another transformation. But when I look at the output rows, the first three rows don't exactly mirror the original. Let's check the third output row in Example 0: [0,3,2,2,3,0], which is the same as the third input row [0,3,2] followed by [2,3,0]. Oh, that's a mirror of the original row. So perhaps each input row is duplicated and then mirrored or transformed in some way.\n\nWait, the third input row is [0,3,2]. The third output row is [0,3,2,2,3,0], which is the original row followed by its reverse. Then the fourth output row is the same as the third, but the fourth row in Example 0's output is again [0,3,2,2,3,0]. Hmm, maybe there's a pattern where each row is mirrored and combined with other rows.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the entire output matrix, perhaps it's constructed by reflecting the input matrix both horizontally and vertically and combining them. For example, the original 3x3 matrix could be placed in the top-left corner of the 6x6 output, then mirrored to the right (horizontal reflection), then mirrored down (vertical reflection), and so on. But let's check if that's the case.\n\nTake Example 0's input matrix:\n\nRow 0: 8,5,0\nRow 1:8,5,3\nRow 2:0,3,2\n\nIf we create a 6x6 matrix by mirroring horizontally and vertically, the top-left 3x3 is original. The top-right would be the horizontal mirror of the original. The bottom-left would be the vertical mirror. The bottom-right would be the vertical and horizontal mirror.\n\nLet's see:\n\nOriginal top-left:\n\nRow 0: 8 5 0 | 0 5 8 (horizontal mirror)\nRow 1:8 5 3 | 3 5 8\nRow 2:0 3 2 | 2 3 0\n-------------\nVertical mirror (rows 3-5):\n\nRow 3:0 3 2 | 2 3 0 (original row 2 mirrored)\nRow 4:8 5 3 | 3 5 8 (original row 1 mirrored)\nRow 5:8 5 0 | 0 5 8 (original row 0 mirrored)\n\nBut the actual output in Example 0 is different. The first row of output is [8,5,0,0,8,8], which doesn't match the horizontal mirror (0,5,8). So maybe that's not the case.\n\nAnother angle: Let's look at each output row in Example 0. The first output row is [8,5,0,0,8,8]. The first three elements are the original first row. The next three elements are 0,8,8. Where do these come from? The original third element of the first row is 0. Then perhaps the next elements are taken from other parts of the matrix. Let's see:\n\nIn Example 0's input, the third row is [0,3,2]. The first element of the third row is 0, which is the first element in the fourth position of the first output row. Then the 8 and 8: perhaps the first element of the first row (8) is used. But this is speculative.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is constructed by concatenating each row with some transformed version of another row. For instance, the first output row in Example 0 is the original first row [8,5,0] followed by the reversed third row [0,3,2] reversed becomes [2,3,0], but then how does that become 0,8,8?\n\nWait, maybe each row in the output is a combination of elements from the same position in different rows. Let's take the first output row of Example 0: [8,5,0,0,8,8]. The first three elements are the first row. The next three elements: 0,8,8. Where do these come from?\n\nLooking at the input matrix's columns:\n\nOriginal input columns are:\n\nColumn 0: 8,8,0\n\nColumn 1:5,5,3\n\nColumn 2:0,3,2\n\nMaybe the next three elements are taken from column 0, but reversed. Column 0 is [8,8,0], reversed is [0,8,8]. So 0,8,8. That matches the first output row's last three elements. So the first output row is original row 0 followed by reversed column 0.\n\nLet's check if this holds for other rows.\n\nTake the second output row in Example 0: [8,5,3,3,5,5]. The first three elements are the second input row. The next three elements: 3,5,5. The input's column 1 is [5,5,3], reversed is [3,5,5]. So yes, reversed column 1.\n\nThird output row: [0,3,2,2,3,0]. First three elements are third input row. Next three elements: 2,3,0. Column 2 of input is [0,3,2], reversed is [2,3,0]. So that matches.\n\nFourth output row: [0,3,2,2,3,0] again. Wait, this is the same as the third output row. Hmm. But according to the pattern, the fourth row would be row 3 (since input is 3x3, output is 6x6). Wait, maybe each output row is a combination of the input row and the reversed column from the input. But then rows 4-6 would need to follow a different pattern.\n\nWait, in Example 0, the fourth output row is [0,3,2,2,3,0], which is the same as the third output row. The fifth output row is [5,5,3,3,5,8]. Let's see: first three elements 5,5,3. The input's row 1 (second row) is [8,5,3]. Not sure. The next three elements 3,5,8. Reversed column 0 is [0,8,8], but this doesn't match. Hmm, perhaps another pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the original 3x3 matrix followed by its mirror images. For example, the output could be the original matrix, then a horizontal flip, then a vertical flip, then a combination. But this isn't exactly matching.\n\nLet's take another approach. Let's see how each element in the output is derived from the input.\n\nIn Example 0's output, the first row is [8,5,0,0,8,8]. The first three elements are the original first row. The next three: 0,8,8. Let's see where 0 comes from. The input's first element of the third row is 0. The 8s could be the first element of the first and second rows (both 8). So maybe the next three elements are combining elements from different rows and columns.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output rows are constructed by taking each row from the input, followed by a modified version of that row. For example, the first row is followed by elements that are some function of the original row. But the function isn't clear yet.\n\nAnother observation: in the output of Example 0, the fourth row is the same as the third row. The fifth row is [5,5,3,3,5,8]. Let's look at the input. The second row is [8,5,3], and the third row is [0,3,2]. How do these relate to the fifth row?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is created by reflecting the input matrix in both directions. For a 3x3 input, the output is 6x6, which could be a combination of the original matrix and its reflections. Let's imagine:\n\nThe top-left quadrant is the original matrix. The top-right is a horizontal mirror. The bottom-left is a vertical mirror. The bottom-right is a 180-degree rotation (both vertical and horizontal mirror).\n\nLet's test this hypothesis with Example 0.\n\nOriginal matrix (3x3):\n\n8 5 0\n\n8 5 3\n\n0 3 2\n\nTop-right quadrant (horizontal mirror of original):\n\nOriginal row 0: 8 5 0 \u2192 mirrored becomes 0 5 8\n\nRow 1:8 5 3 \u2192 mirrored 3 5 8\n\nRow 2:0 3 2 \u2192 mirrored 2 3 0\n\nSo top-right quadrant would be:\n\n0 5 8\n\n3 5 8\n\n2 3 0\n\nBottom-left quadrant (vertical mirror of original):\n\nOriginal columns reversed row-wise. Original rows 0,1,2 become rows 2,1,0.\n\nSo vertical mirror would be:\n\n0 3 2\n\n8 5 3\n\n8 5 0\n\nBottom-right quadrant (vertical mirror of top-right, or horizontal mirror of bottom-left):\n\nIf vertical mirror of top-right, it would be:\n\n2 3 0 \u2192 row 0 of top-right mirrored vertically (but this is getting complicated).\n\nAlternatively, bottom-right is the 180 rotation of the original. So each element (i,j) becomes (2-i, 2-j). Let's compute:\n\nOriginal element (0,0)=8 \u2192 (2,2)=2\n\n(0,1)=5 \u2192 (2,1)=3\n\n(0,2)=0 \u2192 (2,0)=0\n\nSo row 0 of original becomes [2,3,0] when rotated 180. But this doesn't match the example's output.\n\nAlternatively, combining all these, the full 6x6 matrix would be:\n\nOriginal matrix | horizontal mirror\n\n-------------------------------\n\nvertical mirror | 180 rotation\n\nBut let's see if this matches Example 0's output.\n\nOriginal matrix (top-left):\n\nRow 0: 8 5 0 | 0 5 8 (horizontal mirror)\n\nRow 1:8 5 3 |3 5 8\n\nRow 2:0 3 2 |2 3 0\n\nVertical mirror (bottom-left):\n\nRow 3:0 3 2 | ?\n\nWait, maybe this approach isn't matching. Let's look at the actual output of Example 0:\n\nThe output rows are:\n\n[8,5,0,0,8,8]\n\n[8,5,3,3,5,5]\n\n[0,3,2,2,3,0]\n\n[0,3,2,2,3,0]\n\n[5,5,3,3,5,8]\n\n[8,8,0,0,5,8]\n\nThis doesn't align with the simple reflections. Let's look for another pattern.\n\nAnother idea: Each row in the output is a combination of two input rows. For example, the first output row is original row 0 followed by a modified version. Let's see:\n\nFirst output row in Example 0: [8,5,0,0,8,8]. The first three elements are row 0. The next three: 0,8,8. Where do these numbers come from? 0 is the first element of row 2 (0). 8 is the first element of row 0 and row 1 (both 8). So perhaps the next three elements are taken from the first elements of each row in reverse order. Row 2's first element is 0, row 1's is 8, row 0's is 8. So 0,8,8. That matches.\n\nLet's check the second output row in Example 0: [8,5,3,3,5,5]. The first three elements are row 1. The next three: 3,5,5. The second elements of each row in reverse order: row 2's second element is 3, row 1's is 5, row 0's is 5. So 3,5,5. That matches.\n\nThird output row: [0,3,2,2,3,0]. First three elements are row 2. Next three: third elements of each row in reverse order. Row 2's third element is 2, row 1's is 3, row 0's is 0. So 2,3,0. But the output here is 2,3,0. Wait, the output's next three elements are 2,3,0. But according to the pattern, it should be 2,3,0. But the actual output is [0,3,2,2,3,0], so the next three elements are 2,3,0. Wait, no, the next three after the first three are 2,3,0. So maybe the pattern is taking the third elements of each row in reverse order. Let's check:\n\nRow 2's third element is 2 (input row 2 is [0,3,2], third element is 2), row 1's third is 3, row 0's third is 0. So reversed order would be row 2's, row 1's, row 0's. So 2,3,0. Which matches the next three elements. So yes.\n\nThen the fourth row is again [0,3,2,2,3,0]. Hmm, this repeats the third output row. Not sure why. Wait, maybe each input row generates two output rows. So for a 3-row input, we get 6 output rows. Let's see:\n\nIn Example 0, the output has 6 rows. The first three rows seem to be each input row followed by the reversed elements from the corresponding column. Wait, for row 0: [8,5,0] followed by column 0 reversed (0,8,8) \u2192 but column 0 in the input is [8,8,0], reversed is [0,8,8]. So first three elements of the row, then reversed column 0's elements. But that gives the first output row as [8,5,0,0,8,8]. Similarly, row 1: [8,5,3] followed by column 1 reversed (3,5,5) \u2192 [8,5,3,3,5,5]. Row 2: [0,3,2] followed by column 2 reversed (2,3,0) \u2192 [0,3,2,2,3,0]. Then the fourth row would be [0,3,2,2,3,0] again, but that's the same as the third row. This seems inconsistent. But according to Example 0's output, the fourth row is the same as the third. So maybe after the first three rows, the next three are generated by a different rule.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is constructed by taking each row and then a transformation of the same row. For example, the first three rows are the input rows each followed by a reversed column, and the next three rows are another transformation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output matrix is a combination of the original matrix and its transpose, or some other matrix operation.\n\nLet me check Example 1's input and output to see if the pattern holds.\n\nExample 1 Input:\n[3,8,2]\n[3,2,2]\n[8,5,2]\n\nOutput:\n[3,8,2,8,3,3]\n[3,2,2,5,2,8]\n[8,5,2,2,2,2]\n[2,2,2,2,5,8]\n[8,2,5,2,2,3]\n[3,3,8,2,8,3]\n\nFirst output row: [3,8,2,8,3,3]. The first three elements are input row 0. The next three: 8,3,3. Let's see if these are reversed column elements. Column 0 of input is [3,3,8]. Reversed would be [8,3,3]. So yes. So the first output row is input row 0 followed by reversed column 0.\n\nSecond output row: [3,2,2,5,2,8]. First three are input row 1. Next three:5,2,8. Column 1 of input is [8,2,5], reversed is [5,2,8]. That matches.\n\nThird output row: [8,5,2,2,2,2]. First three are input row 2. Next three:2,2,2. Column 2 of input is [2,2,2], reversed is same, [2,2,2]. So that fits.\n\nFourth output row: [2,2,2,2,5,8]. First three elements are 2,2,2. Which is column 2 of input reversed. Then next three:2,5,8. Column 0 reversed is [8,3,3], but here it's 2,5,8. Hmm, this doesn't fit. Wait, the fourth row here is [2,2,2,2,5,8]. Let's check if there's another pattern.\n\nWait, after the first three rows, the next three might be generated from reversed columns. For example, the fourth row could be reversed column 2 followed by reversed column 0. But not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the entire output is constructed by appending reversed columns for the first three rows and something else for the next three. Let's see:\n\nIn Example 1's output, the fourth row is [2,2,2,2,5,8]. The first three elements are reversed column 2 (since column 2 is [2,2,2], reversed is same). The next three elements are 2,5,8. Which is the reversed column 0: [3,3,8] reversed is [8,3,3], but here it's 2,5,8. Doesn't match.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is arranged such that the first three rows are input rows followed by reversed columns, and the next three rows are reversed input rows followed by something else.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the entire output matrix for Example 1, the first three rows are input rows followed by reversed columns. Then the fourth row starts with 2,2,2, which is the reversed column 2. Then followed by 2,5,8. Hmm. Maybe the next three rows are each reversed columns followed by reversed rows. Not sure.\n\nThis approach is getting a bit stuck. Let's try to look for another pattern.\n\nLooking at the output rows in Example 0:\n\nAfter the first three rows (which are input rows followed by reversed columns), the fourth row is the same as the third row. The fifth row is [5,5,3,3,5,8]. Let's see: the first three elements 5,5,3. These could be from the column 1 reversed. Column 1 of input is [5,5,3], reversed is [3,5,5]. But here it's 5,5,3. Not matching. Wait, maybe the fifth row is column 1 reversed followed by something else. Not sure.\n\nWait, let's look at the fifth row of Example 0's output: [5,5,3,3,5,8]. The first three elements are 5,5,3. The input's column 1 is [5,5,3]. Reversed would be [3,5,5]. But here it's 5,5,3. Which is the original column 1. Then the next three elements 3,5,8. The reversed column 0 is [0,8,8], but here it's 3,5,8. Doesn't match.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is constructed by creating a 6x6 matrix where each 3x3 quadrant is a transformation of the input. For example:\n\nTop-left: original\nTop-right: original rotated 90 degrees\nBottom-left: original rotated 270 degrees\nBottom-right: original rotated 180 degrees\n\nBut I'm not sure. Let's check.\n\nTake Example 0's input:\n\nOriginal:\n8 5 0\n\n8 5 3\n\n0 3 2\n\nRotated 90 degrees (top-right quadrant):\n\nThis would transpose the matrix and reverse rows:\n\nRow 0 becomes column 2: 0,3,2 \u2192 reversed \u2192 2,3,0\n\nRow 1 becomes column 1:5,5,3 \u2192 reversed \u21923,5,5\n\nRow 2 becomes column 0:8,8,0 \u2192 reversed \u21920,8,8\n\nSo top-right quadrant after rotation would be:\n\n2 3 0\n\n3 5 5\n\n0 8 8\n\nBut in Example 0's output, the first row ends with 0,8,8, which would correspond to the first row of the top-right quadrant. But the first output row ends with 0,8,8, which matches the third element of the top-right quadrant's first row. Hmm, not quite.\n\nThis approach may not be correct. Let's think differently.\n\nAlternative idea: Each element in the output is generated based on its position. For a 6x6 output, the position (i,j) can be mapped to the input matrix. For example, if i < 3 and j <3, then it's the original. If j >=3, then it's some transformation. Similarly for rows >=3.\n\nIn Example 0's first output row: [8,5,0,0,8,8]. Positions (0,0-2) are original row 0. Positions (0,3-5) are 0,8,8. Let's see: perhaps for j >=3, j-3 gives the column index in the original, and the row is determined by i mod 3. For example, in position (0,3), j-3=0, which is column 0. The row could be (3 - (i mod 3) -1) = 3-0-1=2. So the value at (0,3) would be input[2][0] which is 0. Then (0,4) is column 1, row 2-1=1? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe for j >=3, the column is j-3, and the row is (3 - i -1). So for (0,3): j-3=0, row = 3-0-1=2. Input[2][0] =0. Then (0,4)=j-3=1, row 3-0-1=2 \u2192 input[2][1] =3. But the output is 0,8,8. So this doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. Maybe the elements in j >=3 are taken from the column j-3, but in reverse order. For example, column 0 in input is [8,8,0]. Reversed is [0,8,8]. So for row 0, j=3:0, j=4:8, j=5:8. Which matches the first output row's last three elements. Similarly, for row 1, j=3-5 would take reversed column 1. Column 1 is [5,5,3], reversed [3,5,5]. So row 1's last three elements would be 3,5,5. Which matches the second output row's last three elements. And row 2's last three elements would be reversed column 2: [0,3,2] reversed to [2,3,0], which matches.\n\nThen, the first three rows of the output are each input row followed by reversed column 0,1,2 respectively. \n\nNow, the next three rows (rows 3-5) of the output. Let's look at Example 0's fourth row: [0,3,2,2,3,0]. The first three elements are the third row of the input. Then the last three are reversed column 2 again. But in the output, rows 3-5 are duplicates of the first three rows but in reverse order?\n\nWait, in Example 0's output:\n\nRow 3: [0,3,2,2,3,0] which is the same as row 2.\n\nRow 4: [5,5,3,3,5,8]\n\nRow 5: [8,8,0,0,5,8]\n\nHmm, this part is confusing. Let's check the pattern for rows 3-5. \n\nAnother idea: The next three rows are the reversed columns followed by reversed rows. For example, row 3 is reversed column 0 followed by reversed column 0 again. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the entire output is constructed by placing the original matrix and its transformations in a certain way. For example, the first three rows are the original followed by reversed columns. The next three rows are the reversed rows of the original followed by something else.\n\nBut let's look at the fourth row of Example 0: [0,3,2,2,3,0]. The first three elements are the third row of the input ([0,3,2]). The last three elements are 2,3,0 which is reversed column 2. So this looks like row 2 of the input followed by reversed column 2. But why is this duplicated?\n\nWait, maybe the output is constructed as follows:\n\nFor each row in the input, create two rows in the output. The first row is the original row followed by the reversed column corresponding to the row index. Then, the second row is the reversed row followed by the reversed column of the reversed row's index.\n\nBut this is getting complicated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is a combination of the original matrix and its transpose. Let's check Example 0's input transpose:\n\nOriginal transpose would be:\n\n8,8,0\n\n5,5,3\n\n0,3,2\n\nBut I don't see how this fits into the output.\n\nAnother approach: Let's look at the first three rows of the output in Example 0. Each row is the original input row followed by the reversed column corresponding to their row index. For example:\n\nRow 0: [8,5,0] followed by reversed column 0 ([0,8,8])\n\nRow 1: [8,5,3] followed by reversed column 1 ([3,5,5])\n\nRow 2: [0,3,2] followed by reversed column 2 ([2,3,0])\n\nThen, the next three rows (rows 3-5) might be reversed rows from the input, each followed by reversed columns again.\n\nFor example, row 3: reversed input row 2 ([2,3,0]) followed by reversed column 0 ([0,8,8]) \u2192 but the actual row 3 is [0,3,2,2,3,0], which doesn't fit. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, the next three rows might be the reversed columns of the original input rows. For example, row 3 could be reversed column 0 followed by reversed column 0 again, but this doesn't seem to match.\n\nAnother observation: In Example 0's output, the fifth row is [8,8,0,0,5,8]. The first three elements 8,8,0 are the first column of the input reversed: column 0 is [8,8,0], reversed is [0,8,8]. Wait, but the first three elements are 8,8,0, which is the original column 0. So perhaps row 5 is the original column 0 followed by reversed column 0. Then [8,8,0,0,8,8], but the actual fifth row is [8,8,0,0,5,8]. Doesn't match.\n\nThis is getting quite challenging. Let's try to find another pattern. Let's look at the last three rows of Example 0's output:\n\nRow 3: [0,3,2,2,3,0] \u2192 same as row 2.\n\nRow 4: [5,5,3,3,5,8]\n\nRow 5: [8,8,0,0,5,8]\n\nLooking at row 4: [5,5,3,3,5,8]. The first three elements 5,5,3 could be column 1 of the input ([5,5,3]) followed by reversed column 1 ([3,5,5]). But here it's 3,5,8. Doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is constructed by taking the input matrix and its rotations. For example, the output is the input matrix, then its 90-degree rotation, then 180, then 270, but this would require more rows.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each row in the output is generated by taking the input row and appending a reversed version of the same row. But in Example 0's first row, the input row is [8,5,0], reversed is [0,5,8], but the appended part is [0,8,8], which doesn't match.\n\nAnother idea: The appended part (last three elements of each row) might be the diagonal elements of the input matrix. For example, in Example 0's first row, the appended elements are 0,8,8. The diagonal elements of the input are 8 (0,0),5 (1,1),2 (2,2). Reversed diagonal would be 2,5,8. Not matching.\n\nAlternatively, the appended elements are the sum or other operations of the input elements. But 0,8,8 don't seem to fit.\n\nLet me check another example to see if there's a consistent pattern. Take Example 2:\n\nInput:\n\n[0,3,0]\n\n[6,6,6]\n\n[0,3,0]\n\nOutput:\n\n[0,3,0,0,6,0]\n\n[6,6,6,3,6,3]\n\n[0,3,0,0,6,0]\n\n[0,6,0,0,3,0]\n\n[3,6,3,6,6,6]\n\n[0,6,0,0,3,0]\n\nFirst three rows:\n\nRow 0: [0,3,0,0,6,0]. The first three are input row 0. Appended part:0,6,0. Columns reversed:\n\nColumn 0 of input is [0,6,0] \u2192 reversed is [0,6,0]. So appended part is reversed column 0.\n\nRow 1: [6,6,6,3,6,3]. Appended part:3,6,3. Column 1 reversed: input column 1 is [3,6,3], reversed is [3,6,3]. So yes.\n\nRow 2: [0,3,0,0,6,0]. Appended part:0,6,0, which is reversed column 0 again. But input row 2 is [0,3,0], so appended part should be reversed column 2. Column 2 of input is [0,6,0], reversed is [0,6,0]. So yes, appended part is reversed column 2.\n\nThen rows 3-5:\n\nRow 3: [0,6,0,0,3,0]. First three elements are 0,6,0. That's reversed column 0. Appended part is 0,3,0. Which is input row 0's reversed column 0. Wait, not sure.\n\nRow 4: [3,6,3,6,6,6]. First three elements 3,6,3. That's reversed column 1 (input column 1 is [3,6,3]). Appended part 6,6,6. Which is input row 1's elements.\n\nRow 5: [0,6,0,0,3,0]. Same as row 3.\n\nThis suggests that the pattern for the first three rows is each input row followed by the reversed column corresponding to their index. Then, the next three rows are the reversed columns followed by something else.\n\nBut how do the next three rows form? Let's think:\n\nIn Example 2's output:\n\nRow 3: [0,6,0,0,3,0]. The first three elements are reversed column 0 (input column 0 is [0,6,0], reversed is same). The appended part is 0,3,0, which is reversed column 2 (input column 2 is [0,6,0], reversed is same). So row 3 is reversed column 0 followed by reversed column 2.\n\nRow 4: [3,6,3,6,6,6]. First three elements are reversed column 1 ([3,6,3]). Appended part is 6,6,6, which is input row 1.\n\nRow 5: [0,6,0,0,3,0]. Same as row 3.\n\nThis doesn't seem to follow a clear pattern. However, another observation: in all examples, the first three rows of the output are each input row followed by the reversed column of the same index. For example:\n\nIn Example 0:\n\nRow 0: input row 0 + reversed column 0\n\nRow 1: input row 1 + reversed column 1\n\nRow 2: input row 2 + reversed column 2\n\nIn Example 1:\n\nRow 0: input row 0 + reversed column 0 ([3,3,8] reversed is [8,3,3])\n\nRow 1: input row 1 + reversed column 1 ([8,2,5] reversed [5,2,8])\n\nRow 2: input row 2 + reversed column 2 ([2,2,2] reversed same)\n\nExample 2:\n\nRow 0: input row 0 + reversed column 0\n\nRow 1: input row 1 + reversed column 1\n\nRow 2: input row 2 + reversed column 2\n\nThis seems consistent. Then, the next three rows in the output are generated by taking the reversed columns and appending something else. Let's look at Example 0's rows 3-5:\n\nRow 3: [0,3,2,2,3,0] \u2192 input row 2 followed by reversed column 2\n\nRow 4: [5,5,3,3,5,8] \u2192 reversed column 1 ([3,5,5]) followed by reversed column 0 ([0,8,8]), but this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the next three rows are the reversed columns followed by the reversed rows. For Example 0:\n\nReversed column 0 is [0,8,8], reversed column 1 is [3,5,5], reversed column 2 is [2,3,0].\n\nRow 3: reversed column 0 + reversed row 2 \u2192 reversed column 0 is [0,8,8], reversed row 2 is [2,3,0]. But the actual row is [0,3,2,2,3,0], which doesn't match.\n\nThis is getting too time-consuming. Let's try to hypothesize that the first three rows are each input row followed by reversed column of the same index. Then, the next three rows are each reversed column followed by the reversed row of the original input.\n\nFor Example 0:\n\nRow 3: reversed column 0 [0,8,8] followed by reversed row 0 [0,5,8]. So 0,8,8,0,5,8. Doesn't match.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the next three rows are the reversed columns followed by reversed columns again. For example, row 3 is reversed column 0 followed by reversed column 0 again. [0,8,8,0,8,8]. Not matching.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the next three rows are the reversed columns in reverse order. For Example 0, reversed columns are column 0: [0,8,8], column 1: [3,5,5], column 2: [2,3,0]. The next three rows could be these reversed columns followed by something else.\n\nBut in Example 0's output, row 3 is [0,3,2,2,3,0]. This is input row 2 followed by reversed column 2. So maybe the next three rows are each reversed column followed by reversed column of the same index. Not sure.\n\nAt this point, I'm not making progress. Let's try to summarize the pattern we can confirm:\n\nThe first three output rows are each input row followed by the reversed column of the same index as the row. For example, row 0 in the output is input row 0 followed by reversed column 0. Row 1 is input row 1 followed by reversed column 1. Row 2 is input row 2 followed by reversed column 2.\n\nThen, the next three rows are each reversed column followed by the reversed row of the corresponding input row. Or perhaps the next three rows are the reversed columns followed by reversed columns again. But examples show inconsistency here.\n\nAlternatively, the next three rows are the reversed columns of the input, each followed by the reversed row of the corresponding input row.\n\nLet's test this with Example 0:\n\nReversed columns:\n\nColumn 0: [0,8,8]\n\nColumn 1: [3,5,5]\n\nColumn 2: [2,3,0]\n\nRow 3 would be reversed column 0 followed by reversed row 0: [0,8,8,0,5,8]. But Example 0's row 3 is [0,3,2,2,3,0], which doesn't match.\n\nAlternatively, the next three rows are the reversed columns followed by reversed columns. For example, row 3 is reversed column 0 followed by reversed column 0 again: [0,8,8,0,8,8]. Doesn't match.\n\nBut Example 0's row 3 is [0,3,2,2,3,0], which is input row 2 followed by reversed column 2. This suggests that perhaps the next three rows are the same as the first three but in a different order. For example, row 3 is row 2 of the first three, row 4 is row 1 of the first three, row 5 is row 0 of the first three. But in Example 0, row 3 is the same as row 2, row 4 is new, row 5 is new. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAnother observation: In Example 0, the last three rows seem to mirror the first three but in reverse order. For example, row 5 is [8,8,0,0,5,8], which looks like row 0 reversed. Let's see: row 0 is [8,5,0,0,8,8]. Reversed would be [8,8,0,0,5,8], which matches row 5.\n\nRow 4 is [5,5,3,3,5,8]. If we reverse row 1 [8,5,3,3,5,5], we get [5,5,3,3,5,8], which matches row 4.\n\nRow 3 is the same as row 2. So perhaps the last three rows are the reversed first three rows. So rows 3-5 are rows 2,1,0 of the first three output rows, but each individual row is reversed. Let's check:\n\nExample 0's first three rows:\n\nRow 0: [8,5,0,0,8,8]\n\nRow 1: [8,5,3,3,5,5]\n\nRow 2: [0,3,2,2,3,0]\n\nReversed rows:\n\nRow 0 reversed: [8,8,0,0,5,8] \u2192 matches row 5.\n\nRow 1 reversed: [5,5,3,3,5,8] \u2192 matches row 4.\n\nRow 2 reversed: [0,3,2,2,3,0] \u2192 same as row 3 (which is the same as row 2, but reversed here would be [0,3,2,2,3,0], which is the same as row 2 and row 3.\n\nSo the last three rows of the output are the reversed versions of the first three rows in reverse order. So row 3 is row 2 reversed (which is the same as row 2), row 4 is row 1 reversed, row 5 is row 0 reversed.\n\nThis pattern holds for Example 0:\n\nRow 5 is row 0 reversed.\n\nRow 4 is row 1 reversed.\n\nRow 3 is row 2 reversed (which is the same as row 2).\n\nLet's check Example 1:\n\nFirst three output rows:\n\nRow 0: [3,8,2,8,3,3]\n\nRow 1: [3,2,2,5,2,8]\n\nRow 2: [8,5,2,2,2,2]\n\nReversed rows:\n\nRow 0 reversed: [3,3,8,2,8,3] \u2192 matches row 5.\n\nRow 1 reversed: [8,2,5,2,2,3] \u2192 matches row 4.\n\nRow 2 reversed: [2,2,2,2,5,8] \u2192 matches row 3.\n\nYes! So the output is constructed as follows:\n\n1. Take each row of the input and append the reversed column corresponding to the row index. This gives the first three output rows.\n\n2. For the next three rows, take each of the first three output rows in reverse order (row 2, then row 1, then row 0) and reverse each of those rows.\n\nSo the output is:\n\nRows 0-2: input row i followed by reversed column i.\n\nRows 3-5: reversed versions of rows 2,1,0 from the first three rows.\n\nLet's verify this with Example 2:\n\nFirst three output rows:\n\nRow 0: [0,3,0,0,6,0] \u2192 input row 0 followed by reversed column 0 (input column 0 is [0,6,0] \u2192 reversed is [0,6,0]). Wait, but here it's [0,3,0,0,6,0]. The appended part is [0,6,0], which is reversed column 0. Correct.\n\nRow 1: [6,6,6,3,6,3] \u2192 input row 1 followed by reversed column 1 (input column 1 is [3,6,3] \u2192 reversed is [3,6,3]). So appended part is [3,6,3]. Correct.\n\nRow 2: [0,3,0,0,6,0] \u2192 input row 2 followed by reversed column 2 (input column 2 is [0,6,0] \u2192 reversed is [0,6,0]). Correct.\n\nThen the next three rows are reversed versions of rows 2,1,0:\n\nRow 3: row 2 reversed \u2192 [0,6,0,0,3,0]. Which matches the output.\n\nRow 4: row 1 reversed \u2192 [3,6,3,6,6,6]. Which matches the output.\n\nRow 5: row 0 reversed \u2192 [0,6,0,0,3,0]. Which matches the output.\n\nYes, this pattern holds.\n\nSo the transformation is:\n\nFor each input matrix:\n\n- Create the first three output rows by taking each input row and appending the reversed column corresponding to the row index (0-based).\n\n- Then, create the next three output rows by taking the first three rows in reverse order (row 2, row 1, row 0) and reversing each of those rows.\n\nSo for a 3x3 input matrix, the output is a 6x6 matrix constructed in this way.\n\nNow, let's apply this pattern to the test input.\n\nTest Input:\n\n[2,5,0]\n\n[2,5,1]\n\n[3,1,1]\n\nFirst, we need to generate the first three output rows:\n\nRow 0: input row 0 [2,5,0] followed by reversed column 0.\n\nColumn 0 of input is [2,2,3], reversed is [3,2,2]. So row 0 becomes [2,5,0,3,2,2].\n\nWait, but wait. Let's confirm: the reversed column for row i is the column i of the input, reversed. So for row 0, we take column 0, which is [2,2,3], reversed to [3,2,2], and append that.\n\nSimilarly, for row 1, we take column 1 of the input, which is [5,5,1], reversed to [1,5,5], and append that to row 1.\n\nFor row 2, take column 2 of input [0,1,1], reversed to [1,1,0], and append that.\n\nSo:\n\nRow 0: [2,5,0] + [3,2,2] \u2192 [2,5,0,3,2,2]\n\nRow 1: [2,5,1] + [1,5,5] \u2192 [2,5,1,1,5,5]\n\nRow 2: [3,1,1] + [1,1,0] \u2192 [3,1,1,1,1,0]\n\nThen, the next three rows are the reversed versions of rows 2,1,0 of the first three rows.\n\nRow 3: reverse of row 2 \u2192 [3,1,1,1,1,0] reversed \u2192 [0,1,1,1,1,3]\n\nWait, no. The entire row is reversed. So the original row 2 is [3,1,1,1,1,0]. Reversing it gives [0,1,1,1,1,3].\n\nRow 4: reverse of row 1 \u2192 [2,5,1,1,5,5] reversed \u2192 [5,5,1,1,5,2]\n\nRow 5: reverse of row 0 \u2192 [2,5,0,3,2,2] reversed \u2192 [2,2,3,0,5,2]\n\nPutting it all together, the output should be:\n\n[2,5,0,3,2,2]\n\n[2,5,1,1,5,5]\n\n[3,1,1,1,1,0]\n\n[0,1,1,1,1,3]\n\n[5,5,1,1,5,2]\n\n[2,2,3,0,5,2]\n\nLet's check if this makes sense. For example, row 3 is reversed row 2 of the first three rows. Row 2 is [3,1,1,1,1,0], reversed becomes [0,1,1,1,1,3]. Yes.\n\nRow 4 is reversed row 1: [2,5,1,1,5,5] reversed is [5,5,1,1,5,2].\n\nRow 5 is reversed row 0: [2,5,0,3,2,2] reversed is [2,2,3,0,5,2].\n\nThis seems to fit the pattern observed in the training examples."
