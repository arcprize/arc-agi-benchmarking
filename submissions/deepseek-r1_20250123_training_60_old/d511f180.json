        "cot_1": "Okay, I need to figure out the pattern that transforms the input matrices into the output matrices in the training examples. Let me start by looking at each example carefully.\n\nStarting with Example 0:\n\nInput:\n[2, 7, 8, 8, 8]\n[5, 5, 6, 5, 4]\n[8, 5, 5, 5, 2]\n[8, 8, 4, 3, 6]\n[6, 5, 1, 9, 3]\n\nOutput:\n[2, 7, 5, 5, 5]\n[8, 8, 6, 8, 4]\n[5, 8, 8, 8, 2]\n[5, 5, 4, 3, 6]\n[6, 8, 1, 9, 3]\n\nHmm. Let me compare each row and column. Maybe some kind of rotation or shifting? Let's check the first row. Input first row is [2,7,8,8,8], output becomes [2,7,5,5,5]. Wait, the first two elements stay the same, then the next three change. Where do those 5s come from? Looking at the input matrix, maybe they're taking elements from below or above. Let's see the third element in the first output row is 5. Let's check the input's third column. The third column in the input is 8,6,5,4,1. But the output first row's third element is 5, which is from the third row's first element? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a shift upwards or downwards. Let me check another example.\n\nExample 1:\n\nInput:\n[3,5,1]\n[4,5,8]\n[2,4,9]\n\nOutput:\n[3,8,1]\n[4,8,5]\n[2,4,9]\n\nLooking at the output, the middle element of the first row is 8. Where does that come from? The input's middle element of the first row is 5, but in the output, it's 8. Wait, the input's third element of the second row is 8. Maybe some kind of rotation. Let's see the output second row is [4,8,5], where the 8 is the middle element. The original middle element was 5. But where did the 8 come from? The original third element of the second row was 8. So perhaps elements are being moved around in a specific pattern.\n\nAnother observation: in Example 1, the output first row is [3,8,1]. The 8 was originally in position (2,3) of the input (second row, third column). So perhaps moving elements from certain positions to others.\n\nLooking at Example 2:\n\nInput:\n[6,5,3]\n[5,7,5]\n[8,8,2]\n\nOutput:\n[6,8,3]\n[8,7,8]\n[5,5,2]\n\nThe first row's second element becomes 8. The original first row had 5 there. The input's third row first element is 8, which in output is moved to (1,2)? Or maybe some rotation. Let me try to see if there's a pattern involving rotating the elements around the center.\n\nWait, in Example 0, the output seems to have elements that come from different rows. Let me look at the third element of the first output row in Example 0: 5. The input's third row first element is 8, but the output first row third element is 5. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe each element is replaced by the element that is diagonally opposite in some way. Alternatively, perhaps the matrix is being transposed in some blocks.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the elements, maybe the transformation involves shifting the elements in a clockwise or counterclockwise manner around their position. Let me check.\n\nAnother approach: look for elements that are the same in the input and output. For example, in Example 0, the first element (2) and second element (7) of the first row are the same. Then the next three elements are 5,5,5. The input's first row has 8,8,8. So perhaps the three 8s are replaced by 5s. Where do those 5s come from? Looking down the column, maybe. The third column in the input is 8,6,5,4,1. So the third element of the first row is 8, but the output is 5. The third element of the third row is 5. Maybe taking the element below? Let's see: The third column of input is [8,6,5,4,1]. The output's first row third element is 5, which is the third element of the third row. Wait, third row, first column? No, that's 8. Hmm. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the elements are being rotated in some way. Let's see Example 1's input is a 3x3 matrix. The output's first row is [3,8,1]. The original input's middle element of the first row is 5, which becomes 8. The 8 in the output's first row is from the second row's third element (8). Then in the output's second row, the third element is 5, which was the original second row's middle element (5). So perhaps there's a rotation where elements from adjacent positions are swapped.\n\nLooking at Example 1's input and output:\n\nOriginal positions (row, column):\n\nInput row 1: [3,5,1]\nInput row 2: [4,5,8]\nInput row 3: [2,4,9]\n\nOutput row 1: [3,8,1] \u2192 the 8 comes from input row 2, column 3 (8)\nOutput row 2: [4,8,5] \u2192 the 8 is in the middle, which was input row 2, column 3 (8) moved to row 1, column 2, but how?\nWait, output row 2 has [4,8,5]. The 8 in the middle here. The original input row 2 was [4,5,8]. So in the output, the 5 became 8, which was the third element. So perhaps the middle element of each row is replaced by the element to the right (for odd rows) or something else.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each element is being replaced by the element that is one position to the right in a circular manner. Not sure.\n\nLooking at Example 2:\n\nInput:\nRow 1: [6,5,3]\nRow 2: [5,7,5]\nRow 3: [8,8,2]\n\nOutput:\nRow 1: [6,8,3] \u2192 the 8 here was from row 3, column 1 (8)\nRow 2: [8,7,8] \u2192 first and third elements are 8, which were in row 3, column 1 and row 2, column3 (5)\nRow 3: [5,5,2] \u2192 first two elements are 5, which were from row 2, column1 and row1, column2.\n\nHmm, maybe there's a pattern where each element (i,j) is replaced by the element from (j, i) in some rotated or flipped manner. For example, transposing the matrix. Let's check:\n\nIn Example 0, the input matrix is 5x5. Transposing it would swap rows and columns. Let's see:\n\nOriginal first row is [2,7,8,8,8]. Transposed first column would be [2,5,8,8,6]. But the output's first row is [2,7,5,5,5]. So that's not a simple transpose. Alternatively, maybe some kind of diagonal flip.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the matrix is being rotated 90 degrees. Let's check for Example 1.\n\nOriginal input 3x3:\n\n3 5 1\n4 5 8\n2 4 9\n\nRotated 90 degrees clockwise would become:\n\n2 4 3\n4 5 5\n9 8 1\n\nWhich doesn't match the output. The output is:\n\n3 8 1\n4 8 5\n2 4 9\n\nNot matching. So rotation might not be it.\n\nAnother approach: look at individual elements and see how they move. For instance, in Example 1, the input's row 2, column3 (8) moves to row 1, column2. Then row 2, column3 becomes 5 (originally row 2, column2 was 5). So perhaps elements are shifted in a way that moves certain positions to adjacent rows or columns.\n\nWait, let's look at Example 1's output:\n\nRow 1: [3,8,1] \u2192 the 8 comes from input's row 2, column3 (8)\nRow 2: [4,8,5] \u2192 the 8 here might come from input's row 2, column3 (8) again? But that's not possible. Or perhaps it's a different approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is that for each row, the middle element is replaced by the maximum value in the row or something. Let's see:\n\nIn Example 0's input, first row is [2,7,8,8,8]. The middle element is 8, but the output first row's middle elements are 5,5,5. So that's not max. Maybe min? 2 is the min, but no. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAnother idea: looking for how the 8s are moving. In Example 0's input, there are several 8s. The output's first row has 5s where the input had 8s. Maybe those 5s are coming from a different row.\n\nLooking at the first output row of Example 0: [2,7,5,5,5]. The 5s could be from the third element of the third row in the input, which is 5. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe each element in the first row (excluding the first two) is replaced by elements from the third row. For example, first row's third element (8) becomes 5, which is third row's first element (8's replacement is 5). Wait, but third row's first element is 8. Hmm. Not sure.\n\nWait, let's check the output of Example 0. The first row's third, fourth, and fifth elements are 5,5,5. In the input, the third row's first element is 8, but the output's first row third element is 5. The input's third row is [8,5,5,5,2]. The third element here is 5, which is the same as the output. So maybe elements from lower rows are being pulled into the upper rows.\n\nBut how? Let's see. For the first row of the output in Example 0, positions 3,4,5 are 5,5,5. The input's third row has 5s in positions 2,3,4. Maybe there's a shift upwards. Like, each element in row i, column j is replaced by the element from row i+1, column j-1 or something like that. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that each element is replaced by the element diagonally below and to the left. For example, in Example 0's first row third element (8) becomes 5, which is the element at row 3, column 1 (8) \u2192 no, that's not matching. Wait, in the input, the third element of the first row is 8, which in the output becomes 5. The element at row 3, column 3 in input is 5. So maybe it's moving from row 3, column 3 to row 1, column 3. That could be possible. But how?\n\nAlternatively, looking for a pattern in how the numbers are being swapped. Let's take Example 1:\n\nOriginal:\nRow 1: [3,5,1]\nRow 2: [4,5,8]\nRow 3: [2,4,9]\n\nOutput:\nRow 1: [3,8,1]\nRow 2: [4,8,5]\nRow 3: [2,4,9]\n\nThe changes are:\n\nRow 1, column 2: 5 \u2192 8 (from row 2, column3)\nRow 2, column3: 8 \u21925 (from row 2, column2)\nRow 2, column2:5 \u21928 (from row 2, column3)\n\nSo it's like swapping elements in a certain way. For instance, in row 2, columns 2 and 3 are swapped. Then row 1, column2 takes the value from row 2, column3. Let me see:\n\nIn Example 1:\n\nOriginal row 2: [4,5,8]\n\nAfter swapping columns 2 and 3: [4,8,5]. Which matches the output row 2.\n\nThen, row 1, column2 (5) is replaced by the original row 2, column3 (8). So the output row1 becomes [3,8,1].\n\nSo the pattern here could be:\n\nFor each row except the last, the middle element (if odd length) is swapped with the next row's last element? Or something like that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe for each row, the last element is moved to the middle of the previous row.\n\nWait in Example1:\n\nOriginal row2's last element is 8. In output row1's middle element is 8. Then row2's last element becomes 5 (the original middle element of row2). So perhaps row i's middle element is replaced by row (i+1)'s last element, and row (i+1)'s last element is replaced by row (i)'s middle element. Then, for the last row, it stays the same.\n\nIn Example1, this would work. Let's check:\n\nRow1's middle element (5) is replaced by row2's last element (8). Row2's last element becomes 5 (the original row2's middle). So that's how the first two rows change. Then row3 remains the same.\n\nSimilarly, in Example2:\n\nInput:\nRow1: [6,5,3]\nRow2: [5,7,5]\nRow3: [8,8,2]\n\nOutput:\nRow1: [6,8,3] \u2192 middle element becomes 8 (from row2's last element which was 5. Wait, that doesn't fit. Unless maybe not the next row but something else.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the middle element of each row is swapped with the next row's last element. Let's test this.\n\nIn Example2:\n\nRow1's middle is 5. Next row (row2) last element is5. So swap them. Then row1's middle becomes5 (no, but output row1's middle is8). Hmm, not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the middle element of each row is replaced by the element below and to the right. Let's see.\n\nIn Example1, row1's middle (5) is replaced by row2's element to the right (8). Wait, row2's last element is8. So row1's middle becomes8. Row2's middle (5) is replaced by row3's last element (9), but in output row2's middle is8. No, that doesn't fit.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Let me try to see if there's a pattern in the movement of elements between the input and output matrices across all examples.\n\nAnother approach: look for how the positions are changing. For example, in Example0, the first row's third element (8) becomes5. In the input, the third row's third element is5. So perhaps moving from row3, column3 to row1, column3. Similarly, in Example1, row2's column3 (8) moves to row1's column2. So maybe elements are being moved diagonally upwards.\n\nAlternatively, think of the matrix as layers, and each layer is rotated. For example, the outer elements are rotated, and inner elements are rotated as well. But this might be more complex.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is a combination of transposing the matrix and then shifting elements. For example, transpose and then shift rows or columns.\n\nWait, let's check Example0. Let's transpose the input matrix and see.\n\nOriginal input (5x5):\n\nRow0: 2 7 8 8 8\nRow1:5 5 6 5 4\nRow2:8 5 5 5 2\nRow3:8 8 4 3 6\nRow4:6 5 1 9 3\n\nTransposed would be columns as rows:\n\nCol0: 2 5 8 8 6\nCol1:7 5 5 8 5\nCol2:8 6 5 4 1\nCol3:8 5 5 3 9\nCol4:8 4 2 6 3\n\nBut the output is:\n\n[2,7,5,5,5]\n[8,8,6,8,4]\n[5,8,8,8,2]\n[5,5,4,3,6]\n[6,8,1,9,3]\n\nComparing the transposed matrix to the output, they are not the same. So transpose alone isn't the answer.\n\nLooking at Example1 again:\n\nOriginal input transposed would be:\n\n3 4 2\n\n5 5 4\n\n1 8 9\n\nWhich is:\n\n[3,4,2]\n\n[5,5,4]\n\n[1,8,9]\n\nBut the output is:\n\n[3,8,1]\n\n[4,8,5]\n\n[2,4,9]\n\nNot matching. So transpose isn't the pattern.\n\nAnother idea: looking for symmetry. For example, mirroring the matrix horizontally or vertically. Let's check Example0.\n\nOriginal row0: 2 7 8 8 8 \u2192 mirrored would be 8 8 8 7 2, but output row0 is 2 7 5 5 5. Not mirrored. So that's not it.\n\nPerhaps the matrix is being rotated in a way that isn't a full 90 degrees. Like, each ring is rotated. For example, in a 5x5 matrix, the outer ring is rotated once, and the inner rings as well. Let's see.\n\nIn Example0's output:\n\nFirst row is [2,7,5,5,5]. The first two elements are same as input. The next three are 5,5,5. Original first row had 8,8,8. So maybe the inner elements are being replaced by elements from the third row. The third row's elements are 8,5,5,5,2. So perhaps the inner three elements of the first row are replaced by the third row's first three elements (8,5,5) but no, in output it's 5,5,5. Not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe for each row i, the elements after a certain position are replaced by the elements from row i+2. For example, row0's elements starting from index2 are replaced by row2's elements starting from index0. Let's see:\n\nRow0 in input: [2,7,8,8,8]\n\nRow2 in input: [8,5,5,5,2]\n\nIf we replace row0's elements from index2 with row2's elements starting from index0:\n\nOriginal row0 becomes [2,7,8,5,5,5] \u2192 but length is 5. Wait, row0's elements from index2 to end (positions 2,3,4) are replaced by row2's elements from index0 to 2 (8,5,5). Then the new row0 would be [2,7,8,5,5]. But the output row0 is [2,7,5,5,5]. Close but not exactly. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the elements from row i+2 are shifted into row i. For example, in Example0, row0's positions 2-4 are replaced by row2's positions0-2: 8,5,5 \u2192 but output has 5,5,5. Not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that each element is replaced by the element two rows below and the same column. For example, in Example0's row0, column2: 8 \u2192 replaced by row2, column2:5. Yes! So row0, column2 becomes 5 (which is row2, column2). Row0, column3:8 becomes row2, column3:5. Row0, column4:8 becomes row2, column4:2. But in the output, row0's elements are [2,7,5,5,5]. So only the third, fourth, fifth elements are taken from row2's first three elements? Not sure.\n\nWait, in Example0's output row0, the third element is5. Looking at row2, column0:8. So that's not matching. But row2, column2 is5. So if in row0's column2, we take row2's column2, then yes. Similarly, column3 and4 of row0 would take from row2's columns3 and4. Column3 of row0 is8 in input, output is5. row2's column3 is5. So yes. So for row0, columns2,3,4 are taken from row2's columns2,3,4. Which are 5,5,2. But output row0's columns2-4 are 5,5,5. Wait, but row2's columns2-4 are 5,5,5. Wait, row2 is [8,5,5,5,2]. So columns 2-4 (third to fifth elements) are 5,5,5. So yes, replacing row0's columns2-4 (8,8,8) with row2's columns2-4 (5,5,5) gives [2,7,5,5,5], which matches the output row0.\n\nThen, for row1 in output of Example0: [8,8,6,8,4]. Input row1 is [5,5,6,5,4]. How does this come? Let's see. Output row1's first two elements are 8,8. Original row1's first two are5,5. So perhaps taking from row3's columns0 and1. row3 is [8,8,4,3,6]. So columns0 and1 are8,8. So replacing row1's columns0 and1 with row3's columns0 and1, giving 8,8. The rest of row1's elements (6,5,4) become6,8,4. How?\n\nWait, the third element remains6, which is the same. The fourth element becomes8 (original was5). The fifth remains4. So maybe columns3 of row1 is taken from row3's column3. row3's column3 is3. Hmm, not matching.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for even rows, different rules apply. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that each row is replaced by the row two positions below, wrapping around. For example, row0 becomes row2's data. But in Example0, row0 is replaced by some elements of row2, but not all.\n\nThis approach is getting too complicated. Maybe I should look for a different pattern.\n\nAnother observation: in all training examples, the output matrices have the same dimensions as the input. So the transformation doesn't change the size.\n\nLet me check if the sum of each row or column is preserved, but that seems unlikely. For Example0, input row0 sum is 2+7+8+8+8=33. Output row0 sum is 2+7+5+5+5=24. So no.\n\nLooking at Example1, input row1 sum is4+5+8=17. Output row1 is4+8+5=17. So sum is preserved here. Hmm. Let's check others.\n\nExample0's output row1 sum:8+8+6+8+4=34. Input row1 sum is5+5+6+5+4=25. Not matching.\n\nExample2's input row1 sum is5+7+5=17. Output row1 is8+7+8=23. So sum isn't preserved.\n\nSo that doesn't help.\n\nAlternative idea: Maybe the transformation is that certain elements are swapped with their neighbors in a specific way. For example, in Example1, the 8 from row2, column3 moves to row1, column2, and the 5 from row1, column2 moves to row2, column3. So a swap between (1,2) and (2,3). Let's check:\n\nOriginal positions (row, column):\n\nInput (1,2) is5, (2,3) is8. After swap, (1,2) becomes8 and (2,3) becomes5. Which matches the output.\n\nIn Example2, let's see:\n\nOutput row1 is [8,7,8]. Original row2's last element was5. Output row1's first and third elements are8. Where do these come from?\n\nIn Example2's input, row3 is [8,8,2]. Maybe elements from row3 are being moved into row1. For example, row1's first and third elements are6 and3. Output row1's first is6 (same), second is8 (from row3's first element?), third is3 (same). Wait, output row1 is [6,8,3]. The 8 is in column2. Input row3's first element is8. So perhaps row1's column2 is replaced by row3's column1. So row1, column2:5\u21928 (from row3, column1:8). Then row3's column1:8 becomes something else. But in output row3's first element is5. Where does that come from? Original row1's first element is6. So perhaps there's a swap between row1, column2 and row3, column1.\n\nSo for Example2, swapping (1,2) and (3,1):\n\nOriginal (1,2)=5 and (3,1)=8. After swap, (1,2)=8, (3,1)=5. Which matches output row1's [6,8,3] and row3's [5,5,2]. But in output row3 is [5,5,2]. So the first two elements are5 and5. Original row3's first two were8 and8. So maybe there's more swaps.\n\nLooking at Example2's output:\n\nRow1: [6,8,3] \u2192 swapped (1,2)=8 (from row3, column1=8)\nRow3: [5,5,2] \u2192 row3's first two elements are5, which were from row2's first element (5) and row1's column2 (5). So maybe row3's first element is taken from row2's first element (5), and row3's second element is taken from row1's column2 (5). But how?\n\nThis seems complicated, but perhaps the pattern is swapping elements between certain positions in adjacent rows.\n\nAnother approach: looking at the positions that change between input and output.\n\nIn Example0:\n\nRow0: [2,7,8,8,8] \u2192 changes to [2,7,5,5,5]. The last three elements change to 5s. Looking at row2's elements: [8,5,5,5,2]. The 5s are in positions2-4. So row0's positions2-4 are replaced by row2's positions2-4.\n\nRow1: [5,5,6,5,4] \u2192 becomes [8,8,6,8,4]. The first two elements (5,5) become8,8. Looking at row3's elements: [8,8,4,3,6]. The first two elements are8,8. So row1's first two elements are replaced by row3's first two elements.\n\nRow2: [8,5,5,5,2] \u2192 becomes [5,8,8,8,2]. The first element (8) becomes5, which is from row0's third element (8) \u2192 no. Wait, row0's third element was8, but in the output, row2's first element is5, which is from row1's first element (5) in the input. Hmm. Not sure.\n\nRow3: [8,8,4,3,6] \u2192 becomes [5,5,4,3,6]. The first two elements (8,8) become5,5. Those 5s might come from row1's first two elements (5,5).\n\nRow4: remains the same.\n\nSo the pattern here seems to be that even-indexed rows (0,2,4) take elements from two rows below, and odd-indexed rows take elements from two rows above? Or maybe each row i is replaced by elements from row i+2, but wrapped around.\n\nFor example:\n\nRow0's elements (positions2-4) come from row2's elements2-4.\n\nRow1's elements (positions0-1) come from row3's elements0-1.\n\nRow2's elements (positions0-1) come from row4's elements0-1? But row4 is [6,5,1,9,3], and row2's output is [5,8,8,8,2]. So no, row4's elements0-1 are6,5, which don't match row2's output first two elements5,8.\n\nHmm, maybe not. Let's see Example1:\n\nInput is 3x3.\n\nRow0: [3,5,1] \u2192 output [3,8,1]. Middle element comes from row1's last element (8).\n\nRow1: [4,5,8] \u2192 output [4,8,5]. Middle element becomes8 (original last element of row1). Last element becomes5 (original middle element).\n\nRow2: remains the same.\n\nSo here, row1's middle and last elements are swapped, and row0's middle element is replaced by row1's original last element.\n\nExample2:\n\nRow0: [6,5,3] \u2192 becomes [6,8,3]. Middle element becomes8 from row3's first element.\n\nRow1: [5,7,5] \u2192 becomes [8,7,8]. First and last elements become8. From where?\n\nRow3's first element is8 (input row3: [8,8,2]). So row1's first element is taken from row3's first element (8). Row1's last element is5 in input, becomes8 in output. Where does that 8 come from? Maybe row3's second element (8). So row1's last element is replaced by row3's second element.\n\nRow3: [8,8,2] becomes [5,5,2]. First two elements are replaced by row1's first and second elements (5 and7). But output row3's first two are5,5. So perhaps row3's first two elements are replaced by row1's first element (5) and row0's middle element (5). But in Example2's input, row1's first element is5, row0's middle is5. So output row3's first two are5 and5.\n\nSo the pattern seems to be that elements are being swapped between certain rows and columns, but the exact pattern is a bit tricky.\n\nMaybe the pattern is as follows: For each row i (starting from 0), replace certain elements in row i with elements from row i+2 (mod number of rows if necessary). For example, in Example0, row0 takes elements from row2, row1 takes from row3, row2 takes from row4, etc. But in Example0, row3 would take from row5, which doesn't exist, so maybe it wraps around or takes from row0. But Example0 has 5 rows, so row3 would take from row5 (which is row0 in 0-based indexing). Let's check:\n\nRow0 (i=0) takes from row2 (i+2=2).\n\nRow1 (i=1) takes from row3 (i+2=3).\n\nRow2 (i=2) takes from row4 (i+2=4).\n\nRow3 (i=3) takes from row0 (3+2=5 mod 5=0).\n\nRow4 (i=4) takes from row1 (4+2=6 mod5=1).\n\nBut how does this work?\n\nFor Example0:\n\nRow0's elements 2-4 (positions 2,3,4) are replaced by row2's elements 2-4 (5,5,5).\n\nRow1's elements 0-1 (positions0,1) are replaced by row3's elements0-1 (8,8).\n\nRow2's elements0-1 (positions0,1) are replaced by row4's elements0-1 (6,5). But output row2 is [5,8,8,8,2]. Original row4's elements0-1 are6,5. So replacing row2's first two elements (8,5) with6,5 would give [6,5,5,5,2], which doesn't match the output. So this might not be correct.\n\nAnother idea: For each row, the elements that are changed are replaced by the elements from the row two below it, but only in certain positions. For example, in even rows, replace certain positions, and in odd rows, replace others.\n\nIn Example0:\n\nRow0 is even (0-based). Replace positions2-4 with row2's positions2-4.\n\nRow1 is odd. Replace positions0-1 with row3's positions0-1.\n\nRow2 is even. Replace positions0-1 with row4's positions0-1.\n\nRow3 is odd. Replace positions0-1 with row0's positions0-1.\n\nRow4 is even. Replace positions0-1 with row1's positions0-1.\n\nBut how does this fit the output?\n\nRow0's output: [2,7,5,5,5] \u2192 positions2-4 from row2's positions2-4 (5,5,5).\n\nRow1's output: [8,8,6,8,4] \u2192 positions0-1 from row3's positions0-1 (8,8).\n\nRow2's output: [5,8,8,8,2] \u2192 positions0-1 from row4's positions0-1 (6,5). But output row2's first two elements are5,8. Original row4's first two elements are6,5. So replacing row2's first two elements with6,5 would give [6,5,5,5,2], which is not the output. So this doesn't fit.\n\nMaybe this approach isn't correct. Let's try a different angle.\n\nLooking at all examples, perhaps the pattern involves swapping the middle elements of each row with elements from other rows. For example, in Example1, the middle element of row1 (5) is swapped with the last element of row2 (8). But the output row1's middle is8, which was row2's last element. Then row2's last element becomes5. But in Example1's output, row2 remains the same. Hmm, no.\n\nAnother observation: In Example0's output, the first and last rows are partially changed. The first row's latter three elements are replaced, and the last row's first element is changed. Similarly, in Example1's output, the first and second rows are modified, and the third remains the same. In Example2's output, all rows are modified except perhaps the third row. Wait, no. In Example2's output, the third row is changed as well. So perhaps the transformation affects all rows except the last one in some cases.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the pattern is that for each row except the last, the elements after a certain index are replaced by elements from the next row. For example, in Example1's row0, the middle element (index1) is replaced by row1's last element. Then row1's last element is replaced by row1's middle element. This would explain Example1's output.\n\nBut how does this apply to Example0?\n\nLet's try:\n\nFor each row i except the last, take the elements from index (length of row - i) or something. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for each row i, the elements from column (i) to the end are replaced by the elements from the next row's columns (i) to the end. But in Example0, this seems complex.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the pattern is a cyclic shift of certain elements. For example, in Example1, the middle element of row1 is swapped with the last element of row1, and then the middle element of row0 is replaced by the last element of row1.\n\nExample1's row1: [4,5,8] \u2192 swap middle (5) and last (8) \u2192 [4,8,5]. Then row0's middle (5) is replaced by 8. This would explain the output.\n\nSimilarly, in Example2's row1: [5,7,5]. Swap middle (7) and last (5) \u2192 but output row1 is [8,7,8]. So that doesn't fit. Hmm.\n\nAnother possible pattern: For each row, the element(s) after the middle are replaced by the corresponding elements from the row two places below. For example, in Example0's row0, which is a length 5 row, the middle is index2. So elements after index2 (indices3 and4) are replaced by row2's elements3 and4. But in Example0's row0, elements3 and4 are replaced by 5,5, which are from row2's elements3 and4 (5,2). Wait, that doesn't match. So perhaps not.\n\nThis is really challenging. Let me try to look for another angle.\n\nLooking at the Test Input:\n\nTest Input is a 4x4 matrix:\n\n[8, 8, 4, 5]\n[3, 8, 7, 5]\n[3, 7, 1, 9]\n[6, 4, 8, 8]\n\nAssuming the same pattern applies, what would be the output?\n\nLet me try to apply possible patterns from the training examples.\n\nIn Example1, which is a 3x3 matrix, the middle element of each row was swapped with the next row's last element. Maybe for even-sized matrices, the pattern is different. Or perhaps the pattern involves taking elements from a specific diagonal or position.\n\nAlternatively, considering that in the training examples, the transformation seems to involve rotating or shifting elements from lower rows into higher rows. For example, in Example0, elements from row2 are used in row0. In Example1, elements from row2 are used in row0. So perhaps the pattern is that elements from row (i+2) mod n are used in row i.\n\nFor the Test Input, which has 4 rows. So row0 would take elements from row2, row1 from row3, row2 from row0 (since 2+2=4 mod4=0), row3 from row1.\n\nLet's try that.\n\nTest Input:\n\nRow0: [8,8,4,5]\nRow1: [3,8,7,5]\nRow2: [3,7,1,9]\nRow3: [6,4,8,8]\n\nIf row0 is replaced by row2's elements. For example, row0 becomes [3,7,1,9]. But that's unlikely. Let's see the training examples.\n\nIn Example0, row0's elements 2-4 were taken from row2's elements 2-4. Maybe the Test Input's row0 elements after a certain index are replaced by row2's elements.\n\nAlternatively, for even-numbered rows (0,2) in the test case (since it's a 4-row matrix), replace certain elements with elements from two rows below.\n\nRow0 would take elements from row2.\n\nRow1 would take elements from row3.\n\nRow2 would take from row0.\n\nRow3 would take from row1.\n\nBut how exactly?\n\nLooking at Example0's row0, the last three elements were replaced by row2's middle elements. For the Test Input's row0 (length4), perhaps the last two elements are replaced by row2's first two elements. Row0's original elements are [8,8,4,5]. row2's first two elements are3,7. So replacing last two elements of row0 with 3,7 gives [8,8,3,7]. But what does the output require?\n\nNot sure. Alternatively, maybe the first two elements of row0 are replaced by row2's first two elements. That would give [3,7,4,5]. But not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the middle elements of each row are replaced. For even-length rows, perhaps the middle two elements are replaced. For example, row0 in Test Input has length4, so middle indices are 1 and2. So elements at indices1 and2 (8,4) are replaced with elements from row2's indices1 and2 (7,1). So row0 becomes [8,7,1,5]. Not sure.\n\nThis is getting too time-consuming. I need to find a pattern that fits all training examples and can be applied to the test input.\n\nLet me summarize what I've noticed:\n\nIn all training examples, certain elements in each row are replaced by elements from other rows. Specifically, it seems like elements are being taken from rows two positions below. For example:\n\n- Example0's row0 elements are replaced by row2's elements.\n- Example1's row0 elements are replaced by row2's elements.\n- Example2's row0 and row1 elements are replaced by row2 and row3 elements.\n\nAnother possibility is that for each element in the matrix, it's replaced by the element that is two rows below and the same column. For example, element (i,j) becomes element (i+2,j). If there are not enough rows, it wraps around.\n\nLet's check this hypothesis with the training examples.\n\nExample1:\n\nInput is 3x3. So for row0, i+2 would be row2. So element (0,j) is replaced by (2,j).\n\nOutput row0 should be row2's elements. Input row2 is [2,4,9]. Output row0 is [3,8,1]. Doesn't match. So this can't be correct.\n\nAnother approach: Maybe the transformation involves swapping elements between even and odd rows. For example, even rows (0,2,4) are modified by taking elements from the row two below, and odd rows (1,3) take elements from the row two below as well. But in Example0, row0 is even and takes elements from row2, row1 is odd and takes elements from row3. This seems to fit.\n\nExample0's row0 (even) takes elements from row2 (even+2), row1 (odd) takes from row3 (odd+2).\n\nExample1's row0 (even) takes from row2 (even+2), row1 (odd) takes from row3 (which doesn't exist in a 3x3). So this doesn't fit.\n\nSo maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, the pattern is that each row i is replaced by row i+2, but for rows near the bottom, it wraps around.\n\nFor example, in Example0 (5x5), row0 becomes row2, row1 becomes row3, row2 becomes row4, row3 becomes row0, row4 becomes row1.\n\nLet's see:\n\nOriginal row0: [2,7,8,8,8] \u2192 becomes row2: [8,5,5,5,2]. But output row0 is [2,7,5,5,5]. Doesn't match.\n\nHmm. So this is not the case.\n\nAnother idea: Looking at the output matrices, the changes seem to involve shifting elements from lower rows into higher rows, particularly in the latter parts of the rows.\n\nFor example, in Example0's row0, the last three elements are replaced by the first three elements of row2.\n\nRow0's output last three elements are5,5,5. Row2's input starts with8,5,5. So no.\n\nAlternatively, the last three elements of row0 are replaced by the middle three elements of row2. Row2's middle three are5,5,5. Which matches the output.\n\nYes! So in Example0's row0, the last three elements (indices2-4) are replaced by row2's middle three elements (indices1-3:5,5,5). Similarly, row1's first two elements (indices0-1) are replaced by row3's first two elements (8,8). Then, row2's first two elements (8,5) are replaced by row4's first two elements (6,5). row3's first two elements (8,8) are replaced by row0's first two elements (2,7). row4's first two elements (6,5) are replaced by row1's first two elements (5,5). But this would create a cycle, but let's check:\n\nExample0's output:\n\nRow0: [2,7,5,5,5] \u2192 last three from row2's middle three (5,5,5).\nRow1: [8,8,6,8,4] \u2192 first two from row3's first two (8,8).\nRow2: [5,8,8,8,2] \u2192 first two from row4's first two (6,5) \u2192 but output is5,8. Doesn't match. Hmm.\n\nThis doesn't fit. So this approach isn't correct.\n\nTime is limited, so I need to make an educated guess based on the examples.\n\nLooking at the Test Input:\n\n[8, 8, 4, 5]\n[3, 8, 7, 5]\n[3, 7, 1, 9]\n[6, 4, 8, 8]\n\nAssuming the pattern is that for each row i, the elements after the middle are replaced by elements from row i+2's beginning elements. For example, in a 4-row matrix:\n\nRow0 (even) elements after middle are replaced by row2's elements starting from beginning.\n\nRow1 (odd) elements after middle are replaced by row3's elements.\n\nBut I need to see.\n\nTest Input has 4 rows. Let's see:\n\nFor row0 (0), replace elements after the middle (which for even-length rows would be elements at positions2 and3) with elements from row2's positions0 and1.\n\nRow0: original [8,8,4,5]. Replace positions2 and3 with row2's [3,7]. So new row0 becomes [8,8,3,7].\n\nRow1 (1), replace elements after middle (positions2 and3) with row3's elements0 and1: [6,4]. So row1 becomes [3,8,6,4].\n\nRow2 (2), replace elements after middle with row0's elements0 and1: [8,8]. So row2 becomes [3,7,8,8].\n\nRow3 (3), replace elements after middle with row1's elements0 and1: [3,8]. So row3 becomes [6,4,3,8].\n\nBut I'm not sure if this matches the pattern from the training examples. Let's check with Example1:\n\nExample1 has 3 rows. Row0's elements after middle (position1) are replaced by row2's elements0 and1.\n\nRow0 input [3,5,1] \u2192 replace position1 with row2's elements0 and1? Not sure. This is getting too speculative.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the pattern is that for each row i, the elements from the middle onwards are replaced by the elements of row i+2's elements from the start. For even-length rows, middle is at length//2.\n\nFor Test Input row0 (length4), middle is at index1. So elements from index2 onward are replaced by row2's elements from index0. row2 has [3,7,1,9]. So elements from index0:3,7. So row0 becomes [8,8,3,7].\n\nBut I need to see if this fits the training examples.\n\nExample1 is a 3x3 matrix. For row0 (length3), middle is index1. Elements from index1 onward are replaced by row2's elements from index0. row2's elements0 and1 are2 and4. So row0 would become [3,2,4]. But the output is [3,8,1]. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAnother possibility: For each row, the elements after the first two are replaced by the first elements of the row two below. For example:\n\nTest Input row0: [8,8,4,5] \u2192 replace elements2-3 with row2's elements0-1 (3,7) \u2192 [8,8,3,7].\n\nExample0's row0: replace elements2-4 with row2's elements0-2 (8,5,5). So [2,7,8,5,5]. But output is [2,7,5,5,5]. Not matching.\n\nHmm. This is really challenging. I think I need to look for a different approach.\n\nLooking at Example2's output:\n\nInput:\n\n[6,5,3]\n[5,7,5]\n[8,8,2]\n\nOutput:\n\n[6,8,3]\n[8,7,8]\n[5,5,2]\n\nNotice that in the output, the middle row has elements [8,7,8]. The 8s here might come from the third row's first and third elements (8 and2), but not sure. Alternatively, the first and third elements of the middle row are replaced by the first and third elements of the next row.\n\nFor Example2's row1: input [5,7,5] \u2192 output [8,7,8]. The 8s could be from row3's first and third elements (8,2). But 2 is not 8. So not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the first and third elements of row1 are replaced by the first and third elements of row3. Row3's first and third are8 and2. So row1 becomes [8,7,2]. Doesn't match output [8,7,8].\n\nAnother idea: For each row, swap the first and last elements with elements from the row two below. For Example2's row1 (5,7,5), swap first (5) with row3's first (8), and last (5) with row3's third (2). So row1 becomes [8,7,2], but output is [8,7,8]. So no.\n\nAlternatively, swap the first and last elements of each row with the row two below's corresponding elements. For Example2's row1: swap with row3. row1 becomes [8,7,2], row3 becomes [5,8,5]. Not matching.\n\nThis is not working. Given the time constraints, I'll have to make a best guess based on the examples.\n\nIn the Test Input, perhaps the pattern is to swap certain elements between rows. For example, elements from even rows are swapped with elements two rows below.\n\nTest Input rows:\n\nRow0: [8,8,4,5]\n\nRow2: [3,7,1,9]\n\nSo elements from row0 and row2 are swapped in certain positions. For example, row0's elements after the first two are replaced by row2's first two elements. So row0 becomes [8,8,3,7], and row2 becomes [8,8,1,9] or something. But not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the first two elements of even rows are replaced with the first two elements from two rows below. For row0 (even), take row2's first two elements (3,7). So row0 becomes [3,7,4,5]. But this doesn't match any pattern from the examples.\n\nAlternatively, in the Test Input's output, the elements might look like:\n\nAfter applying the pattern from the training examples, perhaps each row's elements after the first are replaced by the elements from two rows below, shifted in some way.\n\nBut I'm not confident. Given the time, I'll try to come up with a possible output based on the examples.\n\nLooking at the training examples, the output for a 4x4 matrix might involve swapping elements between rows. For example, in each row, the elements after the first two are replaced by elements from two rows below.\n\nTest Input:\n\nRow0: [8,8,4,5] \u2192 replaced by row2's first two elements [3,7] \u2192 becomes [8,8,3,7]\n\nRow1: [3,8,7,5] \u2192 replaced by row3's first two elements [6,4] \u2192 becomes [3,8,6,4]\n\nRow2: [3,7,1,9] \u2192 replaced by row0's first two elements [8,8] \u2192 becomes [8,8,1,9]\n\nRow3: [6,4,8,8] \u2192 replaced by row1's first two elements [3,8] \u2192 becomes [3,8,8,8]\n\nBut this would give:\n\n[8,8,3,7]\n\n[3,8,6,4]\n\n[8,8,1,9]\n\n[3,8,8,8]\n\nBut I'm not sure if this matches the training examples' patterns. For example, in Example0, the first row's elements after the first two are replaced by the third row's elements. But in Example0's case, the third row's elements replaced the first row's elements. So maybe the Test Input's rows 0 and 2 swap certain elements, and rows 1 and3 swap certain elements.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the elements in even rows are replaced by elements from row i+2, and odd rows by row i+2. For Test Input, which has four rows:\n\nRow0 (even) \u2192 replaced by row2\n\nRow1 (odd) \u2192 replaced by row3\n\nRow2 (even) \u2192 replaced by row0\n\nRow3 (odd) \u2192 replaced by row1\n\nSo:\n\nRow0 becomes row2's elements: [3,7,1,9]\n\nRow1 becomes row3's elements: [6,4,8,8]\n\nRow2 becomes row0's elements: [8,8,4,5]\n\nRow3 becomes row1's elements: [3,8,7,5]\n\nBut this results in:\n\n[3,7,1,9]\n\n[6,4,8,8]\n\n[8,8,4,5]\n\n[3,8,7,5]\n\nBut looking at the training examples, this doesn't fit. For example, in Example1, the output row0 is not the same as input row2.\n\nAlternatively, maybe only certain elements are swapped. For example, each row's first two elements are replaced by the first two elements of row i+2.\n\nTest Input:\n\nRow0's first two elements become row2's first two: 3,7 \u2192 row0 becomes [3,7,4,5]\n\nRow1's first two become row3's first two:6,4 \u2192 row1 becomes [6,4,7,5]\n\nRow2's first two become row0's first two:8,8 \u2192 row2 becomes [8,8,1,9]\n\nRow3's first two become row1's first two:3,8 \u2192 row3 becomes [3,8,8,8]\n\nBut this gives:\n\n[3,7,4,5]\n\n[6,4,7,5]\n\n[8,8,1,9]\n\n[3,8,8,8]\n\nThis doesn't match the training examples. For Example1, this approach would swap row0's first two with row2's first two (2 and4). But the output for Example1's row0 is [3,8,1], which doesn't match.\n\nGiven that I'm stuck, I'll try to find a common transformation in the examples. For instance, in Example1, the middle element of the first row is replaced by the last element of the second row. The middle element of the second row is replaced by its own last element. The third row remains the same. For Example2, the first row's middle element is replaced by the third row's first element. The second row's first and last elements are replaced by the third row's first and second elements. The third row's first two elements are replaced by the second row's first and first row's middle elements.\n\nThis seems too ad-hoc, but perhaps the pattern is that each row's middle element(s) are replaced by elements from a lower row, possibly two rows below.\n\nApplying this to the Test Input:\n\nTest Input is a 4x4 matrix. The middle elements for each row (since it's even length) are at positions1 and2.\n\nRow0: elements1 and2 (8,4) \u2192 replaced by row2's elements0 and1 (3,7) \u2192 new row0: [8,3,7,5]\n\nRow1: elements1 and2 (8,7) \u2192 replaced by row3's elements0 and1 (6,4) \u2192 new row1: [3,6,4,5]\n\nRow2: elements1 and2 (7,1) \u2192 replaced by row0's elements0 and1 (8,8) \u2192 new row2: [3,8,8,9]\n\nRow3: elements1 and2 (4,8) \u2192 replaced by row1's elements0 and1 (3,8) \u2192 new row3: [6,3,8,8]\n\nBut this results in:\n\n[8,3,7,5]\n\n[3,6,4,5]\n\n[3,8,8,9]\n\n[6,3,8,8]\n\nBut this doesn't match the training examples' pattern.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for each row, the elements after the first two are replaced by the first elements from the row two below.\n\nTest Input:\n\nRow0: [8,8,4,5] \u2192 elements2-3 replaced by row2's elements0-1 (3,7) \u2192 [8,8,3,7]\n\nRow1: [3,8,7,5] \u2192 elements2-3 replaced by row3's elements0-1 (6,4) \u2192 [3,8,6,4]\n\nRow2: [3,7,1,9] \u2192 elements2-3 replaced by row0's elements0-1 (8,8) \u2192 [3,7,8,8]\n\nRow3: [6,4,8,8] \u2192 elements2-3 replaced by row1's elements0-1 (3,8) \u2192 [6,4,3,8]\n\nThis gives:\n\n[8,8,3,7]\n\n[3,8,6,4]\n\n[3,7,8,8]\n\n[6,4,3,8]\n\nBut I'm not sure if this matches any training example pattern. For Example0, this approach would require replacing the latter elements of each row with elements from two rows below, which might fit.\n\nExample0's row0: elements2-4 replaced by row2's elements0-2 (8,5,5). But output row0 is [2,7,5,5,5]. So replacing elements2-4 with 5,5,5, which are from row2's elements2-4 (5,5,5). So in this case, it's elements from row2's elements2-4.\n\nSo perhaps in even rows, replace elements starting from the middle with elements from two rows below, starting from the middle.\n\nFor Test Input's row0 (even), middle elements are positions1 and2. Replace elements from position1 with row2's elements starting from position1. Row2's elements1 and2 are7,1. So row0 becomes [8,7,1,5]. Doesn't match previous idea.\n\nThis is really challenging. Given the time constraints, I'll have to make a best guess based on the examples provided. Perhaps the pattern involves rotating elements in a certain way, such as shifting elements from lower rows into higher rows in a specific pattern. Based on the examples, the Test Input's output might look like:\n\n[8, 3, 7, 5]\n\n[3, 6, 4, 5]\n\n[8, 8, 1, 9]\n\n[6, 8, 8, 8]\n\nBut this is a guess. However, looking back at the training examples, especially Example2, where the output's second row became [8,7,8], which includes elements from the third row's first and third elements (8 and8), I might think that elements from the third row are used to replace certain positions in the first and second rows.\n\nApplying this to the Test Input:\n\nRow0: [8,8,4,5] \u2192 replace elements2-3 with row2's elements0-1 (3,7) \u2192 [8,8,3,7]\n\nRow1: [3,8,7,5] \u2192 replace elements0 and3 with row3's elements0 and3 (6 and8) \u2192 [6,8,7,8]\n\nRow2: [3,7,1,9] \u2192 replace elements0-1 with row0's elements0-1 (8,8) \u2192 [8,8,1,9]\n\nRow3: [6,4,8,8] \u2192 no change, or replaced with row1's elements.\n\nBut this results in:\n\n[8,8,3,7]\n\n[6,8,7,8]\n\n[8,8,1,9]\n\n[6,4,8,8]\n\nBut this is just a guess. However, looking at Example2's output, the third row became [5,5,2], which might have been derived from the first and second rows' elements. For example, 5 comes from row1's first element (5) and row0's second element (5). So perhaps row3's first two elements are replaced by row1's first and row0's second elements.\n\nApplying this to the Test Input's row3:\n\n row3's first two elements (6,4) would be replaced by row1's first (3) and row0's second (8) \u2192 [3,8,8,8].\n\nSo the output would be:\n\nRow0: [8,8,3,7]\n\nRow1: [6,8,7,8]\n\nRow2: [8,8,1,9]\n\nRow3: [3,8,8,8]\n\nBut I'm not sure. This is getting too speculative.\n\nAnother possible approach: in the training examples, the output matrices have a lot of repetition of certain numbers from lower rows. For example, in Example0, the 5s in row0 come from row2's elements. In Example1, the 8s come from row2's elements. In Example2, the 8s come from row3's elements.\n\nSo perhaps the pattern is to replace certain elements in each row with elements from the row two below, wrapping around if necessary.\n\nFor the Test Input:\n\nRow0 elements would be replaced by row2's elements.\n\nRow1 elements would be replaced by row3's elements.\n\nRow2 elements would be replaced by row0's elements.\n\nRow3 elements would be replaced by row1's elements.\n\nBut let's see:\n\nRow0 becomes row2's elements: [3,7,1,9]\n\nRow1 becomes row3's elements: [6,4,8,8]\n\nRow2 becomes row0's elements: [8,8,4,5]\n\nRow3 becomes row1's elements: [3,8,7,5]\n\nBut this results in:\n\n[3,7,1,9]\n\n[6,4,8,8]\n\n[8,8,4,5]\n\n[3,8,7,5]\n\nThis doesn't match any of the training examples. For instance, in Example0, the output row0 is not the same as row2's input.\n\nAnother thought: perhaps the transformation is to swap elements in a diagonal manner. For example, swapping elements (i,j) with (j,i) in a certain way. But given the examples, this doesn't seem to fit.\n\nAfter struggling through various possibilities and not finding a clear pattern, I'll have to make an educated guess based on the closest possible pattern observed in the examples. \n\nLooking at the Test Input and trying to apply a similar transformation as in Example1 and Example2:\n\nFor each row, the middle element(s) are replaced by elements from the next row's end. For example:\n\nIn Test Input's row0 (even length 4), middle elements are at positions1 and2. Replace position2 with row2's first element (3). So row0 becomes [8,8,3,5]. Then, row1's position3 is replaced by row3's first element (6) \u2192 row1 becomes [3,8,7,6]. Row2's position0 and1 are replaced by row0's position3 and row1's position3 \u2192 [5,6,1,9]. Row3's position0 and1 are replaced by row2's position3 and row3's position3 \u2192 [9,8,8,8].\n\nBut this results in:\n\n[8,8,3,5]\n\n[3,8,7,6]\n\n[5,6,1,9]\n\n[9,8,8,8]\n\nWhich doesn't match any pattern. \n\nGiven the time I've spent and the need to provide an answer, I'll go with the following approach based on the training examples' pattern of moving elements from two rows below:\n\nFor each row i, replace the latter half of the row with the first few elements from row i+2.\n\nIn Test Input:\n\nRow0: replace last two elements (4,5) with row2's first two elements (3,7) \u2192 [8,8,3,7]\n\nRow1: replace last two elements (7,5) with row3's first two elements (6,4) \u2192 [3,8,6,4]\n\nRow2: replace last two elements (1,9) with row0's first two elements (8,8) \u2192 [3,7,8,8]\n\nRow3: replace last two elements (8,8) with row1's first two elements (3,8) \u2192 [6,4,3,8]\n\nThus, the output matrix would be:\n\n[8,8,3,7]\n\n[3,8,6,4]\n\n[3,7,8,8]\n\n[6,4,3,8]\n\nBut I'm not sure. However, given the examples, this seems plausible.",

        "cot_2": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. I'm looking at the training examples to see how the input lists are transformed into the output. Let's start with the first example, Example 0.\n\nThe input is a 5x5 grid of numbers. The output seems to rearrange some of these numbers. Let me compare them row by row. The first input row is [2,7,8,8,8], and the output becomes [2,7,5,5,5]. Hmm, where did those 5s come from? Looking at the input's second row, which is [5,5,6,5,4]. Maybe there's some kind of swapping happening between adjacent rows or columns. Let's check the next input row: [8,5,5,5,2] becomes [5,8,8,8,2]. Oh, wait, the 8s here are moving around. This seems a bit tricky. \n\nLooking at the second example, Example 1, which is a 3x3 grid. The input rows are [3,5,1], [4,5,8], [2,4,9]. The output is [3,8,1], [4,8,5], [2,4,9]. Notice that the middle element of the middle row in the input is 5, but in the output, the middle element of the first row is 8. Where does that 8 come from? The input's second row third element is 8. Maybe there's a rotation or some kind of shift where elements from adjacent rows are moving. \n\nLooking at the third example, Example 2. Input is 3x3 grid: [6,5,3], [5,7,5], [8,8,2]. The output is [6,8,3], [8,7,8], [5,5,2]. Here, the 8s from the third row's first two elements are appearing in the first and second rows. The second row in the output has 8,7,8. So the 8s are possibly moving upwards or being swapped in some pattern.\n\nWait a second, maybe each element is being replaced by the maximum or minimum of its neighbors? Or perhaps there's a pattern where each element is replaced by a value from a different position. Another possibility is that the rows are being rotated or shifted in a certain way. Let me look for a more systematic approach.\n\nIn Example 0's input, let's look at the output's first row: [2,7,5,5,5]. The first two elements are the same as the input. The last three elements are 5s. The input's second row has 5s. Maybe each row is taking elements from the row below or above. For instance, the third element in the first output row (5) might come from the row below's first element (5 in the second row's first position). Similarly, in Example 1's output, the middle element of the first row is 8, which is from the second row's third element (8). So maybe elements are being taken diagonally from the row below or above. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps each row is shifted in a certain direction, and elements from adjacent rows are being pulled. For example, looking at Example 2's output first row [6,8,3], the 8 could be from the third row's first element (8). The second row in the output has [8,7,8], where the first and third 8s might come from the third row's elements. \n\nAnother approach: maybe the transformation involves taking elements from the same position but in the next row. Like, for each element in row i, column j, it's replaced by the element from row i+1, column j-1 or something similar. Let's test this.\n\nTake Example 1's input:\n\nRow 0: 3,5,1\nRow 1:4,5,8\nRow 2:2,4,9\n\nOutput row 0:3,8,1. The 8 here is in position (0,1). Looking at input row 1, position (1,2) is 8. So maybe (0,1) comes from (1,2). Then output row 1 is 4,8,5. The 8 here is in (1,1). Input row 0's (0,1) is 5, input row 2's (2,1) is 4. Not sure. Alternatively, maybe a clockwise rotation of elements around the center. For a 3x3 grid, maybe the elements around the center are rotated. \n\nAlternatively, maybe it's a mirroring. But the examples don't seem to show simple mirroring. \n\nLet me check the third example's output. Input row 0 is [6,5,3], output is [6,8,3]. The 8 could be from row 2's first element. The output row 1 is [8,7,8], which has 8s from row 2's first and second elements (8,8), and the last 8 might come from row 0's third element (3)? That doesn't fit. Wait, output row 1's third element is 8, but input row 1's third element is 5. So maybe it's taking elements from the next row. Output row 1's third element 8 could come from row 2's third element (2)? No, that's 2, which doesn't match. Hmm.\n\nAnother angle: looking at the test input. It's a 4x4 grid. The training examples include 5x5, 3x3, and 3x3. So the pattern should work for any size. Let me try to find a common pattern across all examples.\n\nLet's take Example 1's input and output. The output has the middle element of the first row as 8. The input's second row, third element is 8. So maybe moving elements from the right side of the next row up. For instance, in row i, column j, take the element from row i+1, column j+1. But in the first example, the third element in the first output row is 5. Input's second row, first element is 5. So maybe column shifts.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each element (i,j) is replaced by the element from (i+1, j-1), wrapping around if necessary. Let's test that. For Example 1:\n\nOutput row 0, column 1: 8. Input row 1, column 2:8. So (0,1) comes from (1,2). Similarly, output row 1, column 1:8. Input row 2, column 0:2. No, that's 2, not 8. So maybe not that.\n\nWait, perhaps it's a diagonal shift. For example, elements are shifted along the diagonals. Let's think:\n\nIn Example 0, the output's first row is [2,7,5,5,5]. The third element is 5. The input's second row starts with 5. So perhaps the third element in row 0 is taken from the first element of row 1. Then the fourth element of row 0 (5) would come from row 1's second element (5). The fifth element 5 comes from row 1's third element (6?), which doesn't match. Wait, row 1 input is [5,5,6,5,4], so the third element is 6, but output row 0's third element is 5. That doesn't fit. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe elements are being rotated in a clockwise spiral. For example, in a 5x5 grid, the outer layers are rotated. But that seems complicated for a pattern.\n\nLooking at Example 0's output, the third row in the output is [5,5,4,3,6]. The input's third row is [8,8,4,3,6]. Wait, the output's third row starts with 5,5. The input's second row starts with 5,5. So maybe elements from the previous row are being pulled down into the next row. For example, output row 3 is taking elements from row 2. Let's see:\n\nOutput row 3: [5,5,4,3,6]. Input row 2 is [8,5,5,5,2]. So the first two elements 5,5 might come from row 2's elements. But input row 2's first two are 8 and 5. So that doesn't match. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the pattern is to shift each row by one position to the right, and the element that's shifted out is moved to the next row. But that might not fit all examples.\n\nWait, looking at Example 2's output. The input is:\n\nRow0:6,5,3\n\nRow1:5,7,5\n\nRow2:8,8,2\n\nOutput:\n\nRow0:6,8,3\n\nRow1:8,7,8\n\nRow2:5,5,2\n\nSo row0's middle element is 8, which comes from row2's first element (8). Row1's first element is 8, which comes from row2's first element, but then row1's third element is 8, which comes from row2's second element (8). Row2's first elements are 5,5 which come from row1's first and second elements (5 and7)? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each element (i,j) is replaced by the element (j, i) from the original matrix (transposed). But checking Example 0's input and output, that's not the case. For example, input (0,2) is 8, but output (0,2) is 5, which isn't the transpose.\n\nAnother approach: Maybe the matrix is being rotated 90 degrees. Let's check. Example 1's input is 3x3:\n\nInput:\n\n3 5 1\n\n4 5 8\n\n2 4 9\n\nIf rotated 90 degrees clockwise, the first row would be 2,4,3. But the output's first row is 3,8,1. So that's not matching.\n\nAlternatively, flipping the matrix. But the outputs don't seem to be simple flips.\n\nWait, let's look for a pattern where certain positions are swapped. For example, in Example 1's output:\n\nOriginal middle element (5) in input's row1 is replaced by 8. The 8 is from row1, column3 in input. So maybe swapping elements diagonally across the center. Like for each element (i,j), swap with (n-1-j, n-1-i), but that's for a reflection. But in a 3x3 grid, (0,1) would swap with (1,2), which is what happened in Example1: input's (1,2) is 8, which becomes (0,1) in output. Then (1,1) remains 8 in output. Hmm, but in Example1's output, the middle element is 8, which in input was 5. So maybe the center stays the same, but the others swap. Wait, input's (0,1) is 5, output's (0,1) is 8. Input's (1,2) is 8, output's (1,2) is 5. So swapping (0,1) and (1,2). Then (1,2) in output is 5, which was input's (0,1) 5. So yes! They swapped. Similarly, in Example2's input and output, let's see:\n\nExample2 input:\n\nRow0:6,5,3\n\nRow1:5,7,5\n\nRow2:8,8,2\n\nOutput row0:6,8,3 \u2192 middle element is 8. Input's (1,2) is 5, output's (0,1) is 8 (from row2's first element). Wait, perhaps it's a different swap.\n\nAlternatively, the pattern is that for each element (i,j), it is replaced by the element (i+1, j-1) if possible. Otherwise, wrap around. Let's test this for Example1.\n\nIn Example1's input:\n\nFor (0,1), which is 5. (i+1, j-1) would be (1,0) which is 4. But in output, (0,1) is 8, which is from (1,2). So that's not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's a diagonal shift upwards. For example, each element (i,j) is replaced by (i-1, j+1), if possible. For (0,1) in Example1, that would be (-1,2), which is out of bounds, so maybe taking from the bottom. Not sure.\n\nAnother thought: looking at the outputs, the 8s are prominent. Maybe the transformation involves moving the maximum values in a certain way. For instance, each row's maximum is moved to the next row. But in Example0's input, row0's max is 8, but in output, row0 has 5s. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that each element is replaced by the element directly below it, but with some rotation. For example, in Example1's first row, the middle element 5 is replaced by 8, which is directly below in row1's third element. So row0's (0,1) becomes row1's (1,2). That's a diagonal move. Let's check other positions.\n\nIn Example1's output, row1's middle element is 8, which comes from row2's middle element (4?), no. Input row2's (2,1) is 4, but output row1's (1,1) is 8. Hmm, that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each element (i,j) is replaced by (i+1, j), except for the last row, which takes from the first row. But in Example0, the first row's third element is 5, which would be from row1's third element (6). That doesn't match.\n\nWait, maybe looking at the positions where the values change. For Example0's input and output:\n\nOriginal row0: [2,7,8,8,8] \u2192 output [2,7,5,5,5]\n\nThe elements after index 1 in row0 are replaced with 5s. Where do those 5s come from? Looking at row1's input: [5,5,6,5,4]. The 5s are in the first, second, and fourth positions. So maybe row0's elements starting from index 2 are replaced with elements from row1's first few elements. Row0's output elements at positions 2,3,4 are 5,5,5. Row1's first three elements are 5,5,6. So only the first two 5s are taken. Not sure.\n\nAnother observation: in all examples, the output matrices have elements that seem to come from surrounding positions. Maybe the transformation is a kind of convolution or kernel operation where each element is replaced by a neighboring element. For instance, each element is replaced by the maximum of its neighbors. Let's check.\n\nIn Example1's input, (0,1) is 5. Its neighbors are 3 (left), 1 (right), 4 (below), and 5 (diagonals). The maximum is 5. But output (0,1) is 8. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, each element is replaced by the element to the right and down. For example, (i,j) becomes (i+1, j+1). Let's test this in Example1. (0,1) would become (1,2), which is 8. That matches the output. (1,2) in input is 8, which becomes (2,3), which is out of bounds. But the output's (1,2) is 5. Hmm. Maybe for elements that can't shift down-right, they wrap around or take from somewhere else. But this is getting complicated.\n\nLet's look for a different pattern. Maybe the transformation is to rotate the matrix 90 degrees and then swap certain elements. But I tried that and it didn't fit.\n\nWait, looking at Example0's output, the third row is [5,5,4,3,6]. Comparing to input rows:\n\nInput row2: [8,5,5,5,2]\n\nInput row3: [8,8,4,3,6]\n\nThe output row3's first two elements are 5,5. Those are from row2's first two elements (8,5), which don't match. Hmm.\n\nAlternative idea: perhaps the transformation is to take the elements in a spiral order and then refill them in a different order. But this might be too complex.\n\nLooking back at the test input, which is a 4x4 matrix. Let's think about how the pattern would apply here. The test input is:\n\nRow0:8,8,4,5\n\nRow1:3,8,7,5\n\nRow2:3,7,1,9\n\nRow3:6,4,8,8\n\nIf the pattern from the examples applies here, perhaps elements from lower rows are moved to upper rows. For instance, in Example1, the middle element of the first row was taken from row1's third element. So maybe in the test input, the element (0,1) would be replaced by (1,2) or something similar.\n\nAlternatively, for each element (i,j), replace it with the element from (i+1, j-1) if possible. Let's try this for the test input.\n\nTest input:\n\nRow0: [8,8,4,5]\n\nRow1: [3,8,7,5]\n\nRow2: [3,7,1,9]\n\nRow3: [6,4,8,8]\n\nApplying (i+1, j-1) for each element:\n\nFor element (0,0): i+1=1, j-1=-1 (invalid). Maybe wrap around. If j-1 is invalid, take from the end. So j-1=3 (if columns are 0-based). So (1,3) is 5. So output (0,0) becomes 5.\n\nBut in Example0's first element remained 2. So perhaps this isn't the case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe elements are shifted down and to the left. For example, each element is replaced by the one below and to the left. So for (i,j), it's replaced by (i+1, j-1). Let's test this for Example1's input.\n\nIn Example1, (0,1) becomes (1,0)=4. But the output (0,1) is 8. So no. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each row is shifted right by one, and the element that falls off is moved to the next row's start. For example, row0 shifted right: [8, 8, 4, 5] becomes [5,8,8,4]. Then, row1 takes the 5 from row0's end. But not sure how this would work across examples.\n\nAnother approach: looking at the output matrices, there's a pattern where certain numbers are arranged in a diagonal. For example, in Example0's output, the first row has 2,7,5,5,5. The 5s might be from the second row's elements. Similarly, in Example1's output, the 8s form a diagonal from (0,1) to (1,1) to (1,2). Maybe elements are being moved along diagonals.\n\nAlternatively, think of the matrix as layers, and each layer is rotated. For a 5x5 matrix, the outer layer is rotated, then the next layer, etc. But I'm not sure how this applies to the given examples.\n\nWait, looking at Example2's input and output:\n\nInput:\n\n6 5 3\n\n5 7 5\n\n8 8 2\n\nOutput:\n\n6 8 3\n\n8 7 8\n\n5 5 2\n\nNotice that the 8s from the third row (8,8,2) are appearing in the first and second rows. The output's first row's second element is 8 (from row3's first element), and the second row's first and third elements are 8s (from row3's first and second elements). The third row becomes [5,5,2], which are the elements from the second row's first two elements (5,7) but why 5 and 5?\n\nHmm. Maybe the third row is shifted up, and elements from the third row are moved into the first and second rows. Like, the third row's elements are being distributed upwards. For example, row3's first element (8) moves to row0's second position, and row3's second element (8) moves to row1's first and third positions. Then row3's new elements are from the original row2's first two elements (5 and7). But this is speculative.\n\nAlternatively, for each element in the last row, they are moved up one row, and the previous elements are shifted. But this is vague.\n\nAlternatively, the transformation could be that each element (i,j) is replaced by the element (i-1, j) from the input, except for the first row, which takes elements from the last row. For example, in Example2:\n\nOutput row0 would be elements from row2 (last row) shifted. But row0's output is [6,8,3]. The input row0's first element is 6, which stays. The second element becomes 8, which is from row2's first element. The third element stays 3. So perhaps for row0, the elements after the first are taken from the row below's previous elements. But this is getting complicated.\n\nAnother idea: looking at the test input, which is 4x4. If the pattern is to take elements from the row below in a certain way, maybe the output's first row would take elements from the second row, the second row from the third, etc., with the last row taking from the first. For instance:\n\nTest input:\n\nRow0:8,8,4,5\n\nRow1:3,8,7,5\n\nRow2:3,7,1,9\n\nRow3:6,4,8,8\n\nApplying a shift where each row is replaced by the row below. So row0 becomes row1's elements: [3,8,7,5]. But looking at the training examples, this isn't the case. For Example1, input row0 becomes [3,8,1], which isn't row1's elements. So that's not the pattern.\n\nAlternatively, a diagonal swap where elements are moved to the row above. For example, element (i,j) moves to (i-1, j+1). For example, in Example1's input, (1,2)=8 moves to (0,1)=8. This matches. Then, (2,0)=2 would move to (1,1)=8. But output row1's (1,1) is 8, which comes from input's (2,0)=2? No. That doesn't fit.\n\nBut in Example1's output, (0,1)=8 comes from input's (1,2)=8. (1,1)=8 comes from input's (2,0)=2, which doesn't fit. So this might not be the case.\n\nWait, another observation: in Example0's output, the third row is [5,5,4,3,6]. The input's third row is [8,8,4,3,6]. The first two elements (8,8) became 5,5. Looking at the input's row2, which is [8,5,5,5,2]. So the first two elements 8,5. Maybe the output row3's first two elements are taken from row2's elements 5,5 (since row2's elements after the first are 5,5,5,2). So row3's first two elements in output are 5,5, which are from row2's elements. But row2's first element is 8. Hmm, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each row is being replaced by the previous row's elements shifted in some way. For example, row0 in output is row0's first two elements plus row1's first three elements, but that doesn't fit exactly.\n\nAlternatively, think of the matrix as being transformed by moving elements from the bottom-right direction upwards. Like a diagonal filling. But this is vague.\n\nLet me try to find a pattern that works across all examples. Let's look at the positions that change and where their new values come from.\n\nExample1:\n\nInput:\n\n3 5 1\n\n4 5 8\n\n2 4 9\n\nOutput:\n\n3 8 1\n\n4 8 5\n\n2 4 9\n\nChanges:\n\n(0,1) from 5\u21928\n\n(1,2) from 8\u21925\n\n(1,1) from5\u21928\n\nSo (0,1) and (1,2) swapped? Let's see:\n\nOriginal (0,1)=5, (1,2)=8. After swap, (0,1)=8, (1,2)=5. But in the output, (1,1) is 8 as well. So that's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, (0,1) and (1,1) are swapped. Original (0,1)=5 and (1,1)=5. Swapping them would leave 5s. But output has 8 and 8. So no.\n\nExample2's output has (0,1)=8 (from input row2's (0,0)=8?), and (1,0)=8 (from input row2's (0,0)=8?), (1,2)=8 (from input row2's (0,1)=8). So it's like elements from the third row are being placed into the first and second rows.\n\nTest input's third row is [6,4,8,8]. So perhaps elements from this row are moved up into the previous rows.\n\nIf this is the case, then for the test input:\n\nRow3:6,4,8,8\n\nThese elements would replace certain positions in rows 0,1,2.\n\nLooking at Example0, the third row's elements (8,8,4,3,6) are not directly moved up. But in Example2, the third row's elements are moved up.\n\nAlternatively, the pattern is that for each row except the last, each element is replaced by the element from the row below and the same column. The last row is replaced by the first row's elements. But in Example1's input, row0's (0,1) becomes 8, which is from row1's (1,2). So that doesn't fit.\n\nAnother approach: let's look for the positions that are changing and where their new values come from in the input.\n\nIn Example0's output:\n\nRow0: 2,7,5,5,5. The new values 5s come from row1's elements (5,5,6,5,4). The 5s are from the first three elements of row1.\n\nRow1's output is [8,8,6,8,4]. The 8s come from row2's elements [8,5,5,5,2]. The first two elements are 8 and 8, which are from row2's first element (8) and row2's first two elements (8,5) perhaps?\n\nRow2's output is [5,8,8,8,2]. The 8s come from row3's elements [8,8,4,3,6]. The first three elements of row3 are 8,8,4. So row2's output starts with 5,8,8. Where does the 5 come from? It might be from row1's third element (6) but no.\n\nThis is getting quite complicated. Let's try to see if there's a more straightforward pattern. \n\nLooking at Example1's output:\n\n[3,8,1]\n\n[4,8,5]\n\n[2,4,9]\n\nThe 8s are in positions (0,1) and (1,1). The input's 8 was at (1,2). So the 8 from (1,2) moved to (0,1) and (1,1). How?\n\nAnother possibility is that the 8 is the maximum in its row or column. In Example1's input row1 has 8 as the maximum. Maybe the maximum of each row is moved to the row above. For example, in Example1's input, row1's max is 8, so it's moved to row0. But in the output, row0's (0,1) is 8 and row1's (1,1) is 8. So perhaps the maximum is duplicated to the row above.\n\nIn Example2's input, row0's max is 6, row1's max is7, row2's max is8. The output's row0 has 8 (from row2's max?), row1's max is 8. So maybe the max of each row is moved up. But how exactly?\n\nIn Example0's input, the max of each row:\n\nRow0:8\n\nRow1:5\n\nRow2:8\n\nRow3:8\n\nRow4:9\n\nThe output row0 has 5s, which are from row1's max. Row1's output has 8s, which are from row2's max. So perhaps each row's max is replaced by the max of the row below. But in Example0's row0's max (8) is replaced by row1's max (5). That fits. Row1's max (5) is replaced by row2's max (8). Row2's max (8) is replaced by row3's max (8). Row3's max (8) is replaced by row4's max (9). But the output's row3 is [5,5,4,3,6], which doesn't have 9. Hmm, this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, each row's max is moved to the row above's position. For Example1's row1's max is8, moved to row0. So row0's (0,1) becomes8. That fits. Row2's max is9, which is moved to row1. But row1's (1,1) is8. Doesn't fit.\n\nAnother possibility: for each row, take the maximum value and swap it with the element above it. For Example1's row1 has max8 at (1,2). Swap with (0,2), which is1. So row0's (0,2) becomes8, and row1's (1,2) becomes1. But the output shows row0's (0,2) is1 remains, but (0,1) is8. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAnother angle: the number of elements in each row remains the same, but the elements are rearranged in a specific way. Maybe the first elements of each row are kept, and the others are filled with elements from the next row. For Example0's row0 keeps 2,7, then takes elements from row1:5,5,6 (but output row0 has 5,5,5). Not sure.\n\nWait, let's look at all the examples again and try to find a common transformation:\n\nExample0 input:\n\nRow0: [2,7,8,8,8]\n\nOutput row0: [2,7,5,5,5]\n\nThe 5s come from row1's first three elements: 5,5,6. But output is 5,5,5. So perhaps row0's elements after the second are replaced with row1's first three elements, but the third element is 5 (from row1's third element, which is6?), no. Hmm.\n\nExample1's input row0: [3,5,1] \u2192 output [3,8,1]. The middle element is replaced by8, which is row1's third element.\n\nExample2's input row0: [6,5,3] \u2192 output [6,8,3]. The middle element replaced by8, which is row2's first element.\n\nSo in each case, row0's middle element (or for even-length rows, perhaps the element after the first) is replaced by an element from a lower row.\n\nFor Example0's row0, which is odd-length (5 elements), the third element is replaced by row1's first element (5). Then the fourth and fifth elements are replaced by row1's second and third elements (5 and6), but output has 5,5,5. So not exactly.\n\nBut in Example1, row0's middle element (5) is replaced by row1's last element (8). In Example2, row0's middle element (5) is replaced by row2's first element (8).\n\nTest input is a 4x4 matrix. Let's say that for each row, after the first element, the next elements are taken from lower rows. For example, row0's second element comes from row1's third element, row0's third from row2's fourth, etc. But this is speculative.\n\nAlternatively, for each row i and column j >=1, the element (i,j) is replaced by (i+1, j-1). For example:\n\nExample1's row0, column1: replaced by row1, column0:4. But output is8. Doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, for each element (i,j) where j >0, replace it with (i+1, j-1). For Example1's (0,1) becomes (1,0)=4. Doesn't fit.\n\nBut in Example2's (0,1) is replaced by row1's (0,0)=5? No, output is8.\n\nI think I'm stuck. Let's try to look for another approach.\n\nLooking at the outputs, in each example, the number of 8s increases or changes in a specific way. For example, in Example1's output, two 8s are introduced. In Example2's output, three 8s are added. Maybe the transformation involves taking the maximum value from the entire matrix and placing it in specific positions. But in Example0's output, there are multiple 8s, so that's possible.\n\nAlternatively, the transformation could be a reflection across the main diagonal followed by some shifts. But this seems unlikely.\n\nAnother idea: each row is split into two parts, and the latter part is replaced with the next row's elements. For example, in Example1's input:\n\nRow0: [3,5,1]\n\nRow1: [4,5,8]\n\nRow0's output is [3,8,1], where the middle element comes from row1's third element (8). The rest remain the same. Similarly, row1's output is [4,8,5], where the middle element is 8, perhaps from row2's middle element (4). Doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, the last element of each row is moved to the next row's middle position. But in Example1's row1's last element is8, which moves to row0's middle position. That fits. Then row2's last element is9, which would move to row1's middle position. But row1's output middle is8, not9. So that doesn't fit.\n\nWait, but in Example1's output, row0's middle is8 (from row1's last element), row1's middle is8 (from row2's last element). But row2's last element is9. So that doesn't fit. Hmm.\n\nAnother observation: in all examples, the first element of each row remains the same. Let's check:\n\nExample0's output rows:\n\n[2,7,...]\n\n[8,8,...]\n\n[5,8,...]\n\n[5,5,...]\n\n[6,...]\n\nThe first elements are the same as input.\n\nExample1's output rows start with 3,4,2, same as input.\n\nExample2's output rows start with 6,8,5. Wait, no. Original row0 starts with6, output row0 starts with6. Original row1 starts with5, output row1 starts with8. So that's different. So the first element doesn't always stay the same. So that idea is incorrect.\n\nHmm. Maybe the first element stays the same if it's not the maximum. In Example2's row1, the first element was5, but output is8. So that's not it.\n\nI think I need to find a different approach. Let's look for the movement of a particular value. For instance, in Example1, the 8 in the input's second row third column moves to the first row's second column and the second row's second column. How does that happen?\n\nAlternatively, the 8s are being shifted up and to the left. For example, in Example1's input, the 8 at (1,2) moves to (0,1) and (1,1). But why two positions?\n\nAlternatively, the transformation involves creating a diamond pattern with certain values, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, let's look at the test input and try to apply what I think might be the pattern. Suppose that for each row except the last, the elements after the first are replaced with elements from the row below, shifted left by one.\n\nTest input:\n\nRow0:8,8,4,5\n\nRow1:3,8,7,5\n\nRow2:3,7,1,9\n\nRow3:6,4,8,8\n\nIf row0's elements after the first are replaced by row1's elements shifted left by one:\n\nRow1 is [3,8,7,5] \u2192 shifted left by one gives [8,7,5,3] \u2192 then row0's output would be [8,8,7,5], but this doesn't match any pattern from the examples.\n\nAlternatively, each element (i,j) is replaced by (i+1, j) and (i+1, j+1) values. For example, taking elements from the row below. Not sure.\n\nGiven that I'm struggling to find a clear pattern, perhaps I should try to hypothesize based on the examples and see what the test output might look like.\n\nLooking at the examples, the outputs often have elements from lower rows appearing in higher rows. For example, in Example0's output row0 has elements from row1, row1 from row2, etc. Maybe each row after the first takes elements from the row above.\n\nAlternatively, the pattern could be that each row (except the first) is shifted right by one, and the first row takes elements from the last row.\n\nBut this is just a guess. Let's try applying this to the test input.\n\nTest input:\n\nRow0:8,8,4,5\n\nRow1:3,8,7,5\n\nRow2:3,7,1,9\n\nRow3:6,4,8,8\n\nIf we shift each row (except the first) right by one and take the last element to the first position:\n\nRow1 becomes [5,3,8,7]\n\nRow2 becomes [9,3,7,1]\n\nRow3 becomes [8,6,4,8]\n\nThen, the first row (row0) takes elements from row3 (original row3) shifted. But this doesn't align with the examples.\n\nAnother possible pattern: rotating elements around the matrix in a clockwise manner. For instance, each element moves to the next position in a clockwise spiral. But this seems complex and varies by matrix size.\n\nAlternatively, for each cell (i,j), the new value is the value of the cell (j, i) from the original matrix (transpose). But checking Example0's input and output, this isn't the case. For example, input (0,2)=8, transpose would be (2,0)=8, but output (0,2) is5.\n\nThis is frustrating. Let me try to look for a different angle.\n\nIn Example0, the output row0 is [2,7,5,5,5]. The first two elements are the same as input. The next three are 5s from row1's first three elements (5,5,6). But why three 5s?\n\nIn Example1's output, row0 is [3,8,1]. The 8 is from row1's last element. Row1's output is [4,8,5]. The 8 is from row2's middle element. \n\nMaybe the pattern is that for each row i, the elements from position i onwards are replaced with elements from the next row. For example, in Example1, row0's elements from position1 are replaced with row1's elements from position2. So row0's position1 becomes row1's position2 (8), and row1's position1 becomes row2's position0 (2) or something else. But this is not clear.\n\nAlternatively, for each element (i,j), if j >=i, replace it with (i+1, j) element. For Example0's row0, j ranges from0 to4. For j >=0 (all elements), replace with row1's elements. So row0 becomes row1's elements. But output row0 is [2,7,5,5,5], which doesn't match row1's [5,5,6,5,4]. So this isn't correct.\n\nAnother idea: the transformation involves flipping the matrix horizontally and then swapping certain columns. But I need to check.\n\nExample0's input flipped horizontally would reverse each row. But the output isn't a flipped version.\n\nAlternatively, the transformation is a combination of transposing and shifting. For example, transpose the matrix and then shift rows. But I'm not sure.\n\nLet me try to think of each example's transformation as a series of steps:\n\nExample0:\n\nInput rows:\n\n[2,7,8,8,8]\n\n[5,5,6,5,4]\n\n[8,5,5,5,2]\n\n[8,8,4,3,6]\n\n[6,5,1,9,3]\n\nOutput rows:\n\n[2,7,5,5,5]\n\n[8,8,6,8,4]\n\n[5,8,8,8,2]\n\n[5,5,4,3,6]\n\n[6,8,1,9,3]\n\nLooking at the output's second row: [8,8,6,8,4]. The input's third row is [8,5,5,5,2]. The output's second row's first two elements are 8,8, which match input's third row's first element 8. The third element 6 is from input's second row's third element 6. The fourth element 8 is from input's third row's fourth element5? No.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each even-indexed row is transformed by taking elements from the next row. For example, row0 (even index 0) takes elements from row1. But the output's row0 has elements from row1's first three elements (5,5,6) replaced as 5,5,5. Not exactly.\n\nI'm really stuck here. Let's try to look for another approach. Maybe the pattern is that each element is replaced by the element directly below it, and the last row is filled with elements from the first row. \n\nFor Example1:\n\nInput:\n\nRow0:3,5,1\n\nRow1:4,5,8\n\nRow2:2,4,9\n\nApplying this:\n\nRow0 becomes row1's elements:4,5,8\n\nRow1 becomes row2's elements:2,4,9\n\nRow2 becomes row0's elements:3,5,1\n\nBut the output is different. So this isn't the case.\n\nAnother idea: the transformation is to reverse each row and then shift elements in a certain way. For example, reversed rows might make the pattern more evident. \n\nExample1's input rows reversed:\n\nRow0:1,5,3\n\nRow1:8,5,4\n\nRow2:9,4,2\n\nBut the output's row0 is [3,8,1], which isn't a reversal. So this doesn't help.\n\nPerhaps the key is to look at specific elements. For instance, in Example0's output, the third row is [5,5,4,3,6], which are the same as the input's third row except the first two elements changed to5,5. The input's third row is [8,8,4,3,6]. The 5s could come from the previous row's elements (row2:8,5,5,5,2). Maybe the first two elements are replaced with the first two elements from row2, but shifted. Not sure.\n\nI'm running out of time. Based on the examples, I'll make a guess that the pattern involves moving elements from lower rows into higher rows, possibly in a diagonal or shifted manner. For the test input, which is a 4x4, perhaps each row after the first takes elements from the row below. For example, row0 takes elements from row1, row1 from row2, etc., and the last row takes from the first. Or another way, elements from the lower rows are moved up.\n\nLooking at the test input:\n\nTest input:\n\nRow0:8,8,4,5\n\nRow1:3,8,7,5\n\nRow2:3,7,1,9\n\nRow3:6,4,8,8\n\nApplying a pattern where each row's elements are replaced by elements from the row below, with possible shifts. For example:\n\nRow0 becomes [3,8,7,5] (row1)\n\nRow1 becomes [3,7,1,9] (row2)\n\nRow2 becomes [6,4,8,8] (row3)\n\nRow3 becomes [8,8,4,5] (row0)\n\nBut this is just a cyclic shift, and it doesn't match the training examples. For example, Example1's output isn't a cyclic shift of the input.\n\nAnother possibility is that the elements in even columns are replaced with elements from the row below. For example, column 0,2,... are replaced. But without clear examples, this is hard to confirm.\n\nAlternatively, each element (i,j) is replaced by the element from (i+1, (j+1) mod n), where n is the number of columns. For example, in Example1's input:\n\nFor (0,0): replaced by (1,1)=5 \u2192 output is3. So no.\n\nAlternatively, for (i,j), new value is (i+1, j-1) mod n.\n\nFor Example1's (0,1):\n\ni+1=1, j-1=0 \u2192 (1,0)=4. But output (0,1)=8. Doesn't fit.\n\nThis isn't working.\n\nAt this point, I think I need to make an educated guess based on the examples. Looking at the test input, the pattern might involve moving elements from the last row up into the first few rows. For example, the third row's elements (6,4,8,8) are moved into the first row's positions.\n\nIn the training examples, the outputs often have elements from lower rows appearing in higher rows. So for the test input, perhaps each element in row i is replaced by an element from row i+1, and the last row is replaced by the first row's elements. But in Example1, the last row remains the same, so this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, for each row except the last, replace elements starting from the second position with elements from the next row, shifted left.\n\nTest input:\n\nRow0:8,8,4,5 \u2192 replaced with row1's elements starting from column0:3,8,7,5 \u2192 but how?\n\nAlternatively, the first two elements of each row are replaced with the first two elements of the next row. For example, row0's first two become row1's first two:3,8. So row0 becomes [3,8,4,5], but this doesn't fit the examples.\n\nAfter struggling for so long, I think the pattern might involve rotating the elements around the matrix in a specific way. For example, the elements from the lower rows are shifted into the upper rows in a clockwise or counter-clockwise manner.\n\nBased on Example1's transformation:\n\nInput:\n\n3 5 1\n\n4 5 8\n\n2 4 9\n\nOutput:\n\n3 8 1\n\n4 8 5\n\n2 4 9\n\nThe changes are:\n\n- (0,1) \u2192 8 (from row1, column2)\n\n- (1,1) \u21928 (from row1, column2)\n\n- (1,2) \u21925 (from row0, column1)\n\nSo it seems like the value 8 from row1, column2 is being duplicated to (0,1) and (1,1), while the original 5 from (0,1) is moved to (1,2).\n\nIn Example2's input:\n\nRow0:6 5 3\n\nRow1:5 7 5\n\nRow2:8 8 2\n\nOutput:\n\n6 8 3\n\n8 7 8\n\n5 5 2\n\nThe 8s from row2 are moved to row0's (0,1) and row1's (0,0) and (1,2). The 5s from row1's (0,0) and (0,2) are moved to row2's (0,0) and (0,1).\n\nThis suggests that elements from lower rows are moving upwards into the positions of higher rows, possibly in a diagonal manner.\n\nFor the test input, which is 4x4:\n\nRow0:8,8,4,5\n\nRow1:3,8,7,5\n\nRow2:3,7,1,9\n\nRow3:6,4,8,8\n\nFollowing this pattern, elements from row3 (6,4,8,8) would move upwards into row0, row1, and row2. For example:\n\n- row0's (0,1) could be replaced by row3's (3,0) =6 \u2192 but output would have 8,6,... which doesn't seem to fit.\n\nAlternatively, elements from row3 are moved diagonally up. For example, element (3,0)=6 moves to (2,1), element (3,1)=4 moves to (2,2), etc. But how this would apply to the test input is unclear.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and the lack of a clear pattern, I'll have to make an educated guess. Based on the examples, the output seems to involve moving elements from lower rows into higher rows, possibly in a way that shifts elements to the right or left. For the test input, I'll try to construct an output where elements from the last row (row3) are moved up into the previous rows.\n\nFor example, row0's second element (8) could be replaced by row3's first element (6), but this doesn't fit the pattern from examples. Alternatively, row0's elements after the first are replaced by row3's elements. For row0:8,6,4,8 \u2192 but that's speculative.\n\nAnother approach: looking at the test input and trying to see what the output might look like based on the examples' pattern.\n\nIn the test input, the last row is [6,4,8,8]. If elements from this row are moved into the upper rows, perhaps:\n\nRow0's second and third elements (8,4,5) are replaced by 4 and8 from row3. So row0 becomes [8,8,4,8].\n\nRow1's elements might take from row3's elements as well. For example, row1's third element (7) becomes8 from row3's third element (8).\n\nBut this is just a guess. Given that I'm time-constrained, I'll hazard a guess that the transformation involves moving elements from the lower rows into higher positions, possibly shifting elements to the right and taking from the row below. \n\nBased on the training examples, especially Example1 and Example2, the output often has elements from the lower rows appearing in higher rows, especially in the middle positions. For the test input, perhaps the output is:\n\n[8,6,4,8]\n\n[3,8,8,5]\n\n[3,4,8,9]\n\n[6,7,1,8]\n\nBut I'm not confident. Alternatively, the correct output might be:\n\n[8,8,8,5]\n\n[3,8,8,5]\n\n[3,7,8,9]\n\n[6,4,8,8]\n\nBut this is a shot in the dark. \n\nGiven the time I've invested and the lack of a clear pattern, I'll have to make a best guess based on the examples. The most consistent pattern I can deduce is that certain elements from lower rows are moved to higher rows, possibly swapping positions diagonally or shifting elements. For the test input, the output might be:\n\n[8,8,8,5]\n\n[3,7,8,5]\n\n[3,4,8,9]\n\n[6,8,1,8]\n\nBut without a clear pattern, it's hard to be certain. However, based on Example2's transformation where the third row's elements are moved up into the first and second rows, I'll assume that elements from the last row are moved up. \n\nTest input's last row is [6,4,8,8]. Moving these elements up:\n\nRow0 might take elements from row3:6,4,8,8. But how? Maybe the second element of row0 is replaced by 6 from row3's first element, etc. \n\nAlternatively, the output could be:\n\n[8,6,4,5]\n\n[3,8,8,5]\n\n[3,7,8,9]\n\n[6,4,8,8]\n\nBut I'm not sure. \n\nGiven the examples, perhaps the pattern is to take elements from the row below and shift them to the right. For each element (i,j), replace it with (i+1, j-1). If out of bounds, take from the beginning or end. \n\nFor the test input:\n\nRow0's elements would be:\n\n(0,0): row1, j-1=-1 \u2192 take row1's last element:5\n\n(0,1): row1, j-1=0 \u21923\n\n(0,2): row1, j-1=1 \u21928\n\n(0,3): row1, j-1=2 \u21927\n\nSo row0 becomes [5,3,8,7]\n\nBut this doesn't match the examples. \n\nI think I'll have to give up and make a guess based on the examples' structure. The correct answer is likely:\n\n[8,8,8,5]\n\n[3,8,7,5]\n\n[3,7,1,9]\n\n[6,4,8,8]\n\nBut I'm not sure. Alternatively, considering the test input and the examples, the output might involve replacing certain elements with 8s from lower rows. For instance, the test input's last row has two 8s, so maybe those are moved up. The output could be:\n\n[8,8,8,5]\n\n[3,8,8,5]\n\n[3,7,1,9]\n\n[6,4,8,8]\n\nBut this is just a guess."
