        "cot_1": "Okay, let's tackle this puzzle. So, the task is to figure out the pattern from the training examples and apply it to the test input. Let's start by looking at each example closely.\n\nLooking at Example 0:\n\nINPUT:\n[9, 0, 0]\n[9, 9, 9]\n[9, 9, 9]\n\nOUTPUT:\n[0, 9, 9]\n[0, 9, 9]\n[9, 9, 9]\n\nHmm. The first row of the input is [9,0,0], and the output's first row is [0,9,9]. The second and third rows in the input are all 9s, but the output's first two rows have 0s in the first position. Wait, maybe it's a rotation or a shift? Let me check the other examples.\n\nExample 1:\n\nINPUT:\n[6,6,6]\n[0,0,0]\n[6,6,0]\n\nOUTPUT:\n[6,0,0]\n[6,0,6]\n[6,0,6]\n\nLooking at the input's first row [6,6,6], the output's first column is 6,6,6. The second row in input is [0,0,0], but in the output, the second column has 0s. Maybe it's a column-wise operation. Let's see. The original input columns are:\n\nFirst column: 6,0,6 \u2192 output first row is 6,0,0. Wait, maybe each column is being rotated or shifted. Like, taking the first column and making it the first row reversed or shifted. Let me see.\n\nOriginal input columns for Example 1:\n\nColumn 1: 6,0,6 \u2192 becomes first row of output [6,0,0]? Wait, that doesn't exactly match. Or maybe the columns are shifted down. Wait, output rows are [6,0,0], [6,0,6], [6,0,6]. The first column of the output is 6,6,6 (same as input's first row). The second column of output is 0,0,0 (same as input's second row). Third column of output is 0,6,6. But the input's third row was [6,6,0]. Wait, maybe it's a transpose. Because transpose would swap rows and columns. Let me check.\n\nOriginal input for Example 1 as a matrix:\n\nRow 0: 6 6 6\n\nRow 1: 0 0 0\n\nRow 2: 6 6 0\n\nTransposing this would give columns as rows. So transposed would be:\n\n[6,0,6], [6,0,6], [6,0,0]. But the output is:\n\nRow 0: 6 0 0\n\nRow 1: 6 0 6\n\nRow 2: 6 0 6\n\nHmm, that's not exactly the transpose. So maybe not a simple transpose. Let's check another example.\n\nExample 2:\n\nINPUT:\n\n[0,0,9]\n\n[0,0,9]\n\n[9,9,9]\n\nOUTPUT:\n\n[9,9,9]\n\n[0,0,9]\n\n[0,0,9]\n\nHere, the output is the reverse of the input's rows. The input's rows are row0, row1, row2, and the output is row2, row1, row0. So reversed the order of the rows. Let's see if that applies here. Original input rows:\n\n0: [0,0,9]\n\n1: [0,0,9]\n\n2: [9,9,9]\n\nOutput rows are [9,9,9], [0,0,9], [0,0,9]. So reversed. So row 2 becomes row 0, row1 stays as row1, row0 becomes row2? Wait, original row order 0,1,2 becomes 2,1,0. So reversed. So that's a possible pattern. Let's check if that's consistent with other examples.\n\nExample 3:\n\nINPUT:\n\n[2,0,2]\n\n[0,0,2]\n\n[0,2,2]\n\nOUTPUT:\n\n[2,2,2]\n\n[0,0,2]\n\n[2,0,0]\n\nOriginal rows:\n\n0: [2,0,2]\n\n1: [0,0,2]\n\n2: [0,2,2]\n\nOutput rows:\n\n0: [2,2,2]\n\n1: [0,0,2]\n\n2: [2,0,0]\n\nIf reversed, the output rows would be [0,2,2], [0,0,2], [2,0,2]. Which is not the case here. So maybe the pattern isn't just reversing the rows. So that can't be the case. Let's look for another pattern.\n\nLooking at Example 3's output. The first row is [2,2,2], which might be the third row of the input but modified. The third input row is [0,2,2], and the output's first row is [2,2,2]. Wait, maybe some elements are being moved. Let's see.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each row is rotated. Let's check Example 0's input and output.\n\nExample 0 input row0: [9,0,0] \u2192 output row0: [0,9,9]. So a left rotation by one position. Because shifting left once would take 9,0,0 \u2192 0,0,9. But that's not matching. Wait, maybe a right rotation? 9,0,0 rotated right once would be 0,9,0. No. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each row is reversed. Input row0: [9,0,0] reversed would be [0,0,9], but output row0 is [0,9,9]. So that doesn't fit. Hmm.\n\nAnother approach: look at the positions. Let's see for each example, what changes from input to output.\n\nLooking at Example 0:\n\nOriginal matrix:\n\nRow0: 9 0 0\n\nRow1:9 9 9\n\nRow2:9 9 9\n\nOutput matrix:\n\nRow0:0 9 9\n\nRow1:0 9 9\n\nRow2:9 9 9\n\nSo in the output, the first column is 0,0,9. Original first column was 9,9,9. So first column becomes 0,0,9. Hmm. How does that happen?\n\nWait, maybe it's shifting each column upwards or downwards. Let's check:\n\nOriginal first column: 9,9,9. Output first column:0,0,9. If each element is shifted up by two positions, the first two elements become the next ones, but that's not matching. Alternatively, maybe the first element of the column is moved to the bottom. For example, in the first column of input:9,9,9. If we take the first element (9) and move it to the bottom, the column becomes 9,9,9. No change. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the columns are being shifted in a certain way. Let me see. Let's take Example 0:\n\nInput columns:\n\nC0:9,9,9\n\nC1:0,9,9\n\nC2:0,9,9\n\nOutput columns:\n\nC0:0,0,9\n\nC1:9,9,9\n\nC2:9,9,9\n\nSo the first column in output is 0,0,9. How is this derived? Maybe the first element of each column is set to 0. But in the original, the first column was all 9s. So in the output, first two elements are 0, and the last remains 9. So for the first column: 9 (original row0), 9 (row1), 9 (row2) \u2192 becomes 0,0,9. That's a decrease of 9 to 0 for the first two elements, and the last stays 9. But why?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the first two rows of the first column are set to 0. But why?\n\nLooking at Example 1's columns:\n\nInput:\n\nRow0:6,6,6\n\nRow1:0,0,0\n\nRow2:6,6,0\n\nColumns:\n\nC0:6,0,6\n\nC1:6,0,6\n\nC2:6,0,0\n\nOutput:\n\nRow0:6,0,0\n\nRow1:6,0,6\n\nRow2:6,0,6\n\nSo the output columns are:\n\nC0:6,6,6 \u2192 same as input Row0.\n\nC1:0,0,0 \u2192 same as input Row1.\n\nC2:0,6,6 \u2192 which is input Row2's elements [6,6,0] but modified? Wait, input Row2 is [6,6,0], output C2 is [0,6,6]. So reversed?\n\nWait, perhaps each column in the output is the corresponding row from the input. Let me check.\n\nIn Example 1:\n\nOutput columns are:\n\nC0:6,6,6 \u2192 input Row0 was [6,6,6].\n\nC1:0,0,0 \u2192 input Row1 was [0,0,0].\n\nC2:0,6,6 \u2192 input Row2 was [6,6,0]. So reversed? Row2 reversed is [0,6,6].\n\nSo output columns are the input rows, possibly reversed.\n\nSo for each column in the output, take the corresponding row from the input, reverse it, and set as the column. Let's see if this holds.\n\nExample 0:\n\nInput rows:\n\nRow0:9,0,0\n\nRow1:9,9,9\n\nRow2:9,9,9\n\nIf output columns are reversed rows:\n\nOutput C0: Row0 reversed \u2192 [0,0,9]\n\nC1: Row1 reversed \u2192 [9,9,9]\n\nC2: Row2 reversed \u2192 [9,9,9]\n\nBut the output matrix's columns would be:\n\nC0:0,0,9 \u2192 Output rows:\n\nRow0:0,9,9 \u2192 which would be C0:0, C1:9, C2:9 \u2192 So that doesn't align. Because if columns are reversed rows, the output matrix would be:\n\nFor Example 0, each column is the reversed row. So:\n\nOutput columns:\n\nC0: reversed Row0 \u2192 [0,0,9]\n\nC1: reversed Row1 \u2192 [9,9,9]\n\nC2: reversed Row2 \u2192 [9,9,9]\n\nBut then the output matrix would be:\n\nRow0:0 (from C0 first element),9,9\n\nRow1:0 (from C0 second element),9,9\n\nRow2:9 (from C0 third element),9,9\n\nWhich matches the output of Example 0. So yes, this seems to fit.\n\nSimilarly, in Example 1:\n\nEach output column is the reversed input row.\n\nInput rows:\n\nRow0:6,6,6 \u2192 reversed \u21926,6,6 (same)\n\nRow1:0,0,0 \u2192 reversed \u21920,0,0\n\nRow2:6,6,0 \u2192 reversed \u21920,6,6\n\nSo the output columns would be:\n\nC0:6,6,6\n\nC1:0,0,0\n\nC2:0,6,6\n\nSo the output matrix would be:\n\nRow0:6 (C0 first),0 (C1 first),0 (C2 first) \u2192 [6,0,0]\n\nRow1:6 (C0 second),0 (C1 second),6 (C2 second) \u2192 [6,0,6]\n\nRow2:6 (C0 third),0 (C1 third),6 (C2 third) \u2192 [6,0,6]\n\nWhich matches Example 1's output.\n\nThis seems to hold. Let's check Example 2.\n\nInput:\n\nRow0:0,0,9\n\nRow1:0,0,9\n\nRow2:9,9,9\n\nReversed rows:\n\nRow0 reversed \u21929,0,0\n\nRow1 reversed \u21929,0,0\n\nRow2 reversed \u21929,9,9\n\nOutput columns would be:\n\nC0:9,0,0 \u2192 but the output rows are:\n\n[9,9,9]\n\n[0,0,9]\n\n[0,0,9]\n\nWait, no. Wait, if each output column is reversed input rows, then:\n\nOutput columns:\n\nC0: reversed Row0 \u21929,0,0\n\nC1: reversed Row1 \u21929,0,0\n\nC2: reversed Row2 \u21929,9,9\n\nSo the output matrix would be:\n\nRow0:9,9,9 (from first elements of each column)\n\nRow1:0,0,9\n\nRow2:0,0,9\n\nWhich matches Example 2's output exactly. So yes.\n\nNow Example3:\n\nInput rows:\n\nRow0:2,0,2 \u2192 reversed \u21922,0,2\n\nRow1:0,0,2 \u2192 reversed \u21922,0,0\n\nRow2:0,2,2 \u2192 reversed \u21922,2,0\n\nSo output columns:\n\nC0:2,0,2 \u2192 reversed Row0\n\nC1:0,0,2 \u2192 reversed Row1\n\nC2:2,0,0 \u2192 reversed Row2? Wait, input Row2 is [0,2,2], reversed is [2,2,0]. So C2 would be 2,2,0.\n\nWait, but the output in Example3 is:\n\n[2,2,2]\n\n[0,0,2]\n\n[2,0,0]\n\nSo let's see. According to the pattern, each output column is the reversed input row.\n\nWait, wait no. Wait the output columns are reversed rows of input. Let's re-examine.\n\nIf each column in the output is the reversed input row, then:\n\nFor Example3:\n\nOutput columns are:\n\nC0: reversed Row0 \u2192 [2,0,2]\n\nC1: reversed Row1 \u2192 [2,0,0]\n\nC2: reversed Row2 \u2192 [2,2,0]\n\nSo the output matrix would have:\n\nRow0:2 (from C0 first element), 2 (C1 first), 2 (C2 first) \u2192 [2,2,2]\n\nRow1:0 (C0 second),0 (C1 second),2 (C2 second) \u2192 [0,0,2]\n\nRow2:2 (C0 third),0 (C1 third),0 (C2 third) \u2192 [2,0,0]\n\nWhich matches the output of Example3 exactly. So this pattern holds.\n\nSo the transformation is: For each column in the output, take the corresponding row from the input, reverse that row, and use it as the column in the output. Essentially, the output matrix is formed by taking each row of the input, reversing it, and making it a column in the output. This is similar to a transpose followed by a row reversal, or a combination.\n\nSo the steps would be:\n\n1. Take each row of the input matrix.\n2. Reverse the elements in each row.\n3. Transpose the matrix (so each reversed row becomes a column).\n\nWait, no. Because transposing after reversing rows would not give the same result. Let's think. For example, in Example0:\n\nOriginal input rows:\n\nRow0:9,0,0 \u2192 reversed \u21920,0,9\n\nRow1:9,9,9 \u2192 reversed \u21929,9,9\n\nRow2:9,9,9 \u2192 reversed \u21929,9,9\n\nIf we transpose this reversed rows matrix, we get:\n\nColumns as:\n\nFirst column:0,9,9 \u2192 which would be the first row of the transposed matrix: [0,9,9]\n\nSecond column:0,9,9 \u2192 second row: [0,9,9]\n\nThird column:9,9,9 \u2192 third row: [9,9,9]\n\nWhich matches the output of Example0. So yes, the process is:\n\nReverse each row of the input matrix, then transpose it (rows become columns in order).\n\nSo the transformation is reverse each row, then transpose.\n\nAlternatively, transpose first and then reverse each row, but that would give a different result. Let's check.\n\nWait, let's see. Let's take Example0.\n\nOriginal matrix:\n\nRow0:9,0,0\n\nRow1:9,9,9\n\nRow2:9,9,9\n\nTransposing first gives:\n\nColumns become rows:\n\nRow0:9,9,9\n\nRow1:0,9,9\n\nRow2:0,9,9\n\nThen reverse each row:\n\nRow0 reversed:9,9,9 \u2192 remains same.\n\nRow1 reversed:9,9,0.\n\nRow2 reversed:9,9,0.\n\nWhich would give the transposed and reversed matrix:\n\n[9,9,9]\n\n[9,9,0]\n\n[9,9,0]\n\nBut the actual output is:\n\n[0,9,9]\n\n[0,9,9]\n\n[9,9,9]\n\nSo that's different. So the correct order is to first reverse each row of the original matrix, then transpose.\n\nSo the steps are: for each row in input, reverse it, then transpose the entire matrix (rows become columns in order).\n\nSo for example, in Example0:\n\nReversed rows:\n\nRow0:0,0,9\n\nRow1:9,9,9\n\nRow2:9,9,9\n\nTransposing this gives:\n\nColumns (now rows):\n\n[0,9,9], [0,9,9], [9,9,9]\n\nBut wait, the transpose of a 3x3 matrix would have rows as the original columns. So the reversed rows are:\n\nRow0:0,0,9\n\nRow1:9,9,9\n\nRow2:9,9,9\n\nThe transpose would be columns:\n\n0 (from row0 col0),9 (row1 col0),9 (row2 col0) \u2192 first row of transposed: [0,9,9]\n\n0 (row0 col1),9 (row1 col1),9 (row2 col1) \u2192 second row: [0,9,9]\n\n9 (row0 col2),9 (row1 col2),9 (row2 col2) \u2192 third row: [9,9,9]\n\nWhich matches the output of Example0. So yes, this pattern holds.\n\nNow, applying this to the test input.\n\nTest input:\n\n[0,0,0]\n\n[5,0,0]\n\n[0,5,5]\n\nFirst step: reverse each row.\n\nRow0:0,0,0 \u2192 reversed \u21920,0,0\n\nRow1:5,0,0 \u2192 reversed \u21920,0,5\n\nRow2:0,5,5 \u2192 reversed \u21925,5,0\n\nSo after reversing each row, the matrix becomes:\n\n[0,0,0]\n\n[0,0,5]\n\n[5,5,0]\n\nThen transpose this matrix. The transposed matrix will have columns as rows:\n\nOriginal columns after reversal:\n\nColumn0:0,0,5 \u2192 becomes row0: [0,0,5]\n\nColumn1:0,0,5 \u2192 becomes row1: [0,0,5]\n\nColumn2:0,5,0 \u2192 becomes row2: [0,5,0]\n\nWait wait. Wait the reversed rows are:\n\nRow0: [0,0,0]\n\nRow1: [0,0,5]\n\nRow2: [5,5,0]\n\nSo the columns of this reversed matrix are:\n\nColumn0: 0 (row0), 0 (row1), 5 (row2) \u2192 [0,0,5]\n\nColumn1:0 (row0),0 (row1),5 (row2) \u2192 [0,0,5]\n\nColumn2:0 (row0),5 (row1),0 (row2) \u2192 [0,5,0]\n\nTransposing gives these columns as rows. So the output matrix is:\n\n[0,0,5]\n\n[0,0,5]\n\n[0,5,0]\n\nBut let's check what that would look like as the output. So each row of the output is a column from the reversed rows matrix.\n\nSo the output would be:\n\nRow0:0,0,5\n\nRow1:0,0,5\n\nRow2:0,5,0\n\nBut wait, looking back at the training examples, the outputs are 3x3 matrices. Let me check again.\n\nWait the test input is:\n\nOriginal test input:\n\nRow0:0,0,0\n\nRow1:5,0,0\n\nRow2:0,5,5\n\nReversed rows:\n\nRow0:0,0,0 \u2192 same\n\nRow1:0,0,5\n\nRow2:5,5,0\n\nSo after reversing, the matrix is:\n\nRow0:0,0,0\n\nRow1:0,0,5\n\nRow2:5,5,0\n\nNow transpose. The transpose of this would be:\n\nOriginal columns (now rows):\n\nColumn0 of reversed matrix: 0,0,5 \u2192 becomes row0: [0,0,5]\n\nColumn1:0,0,5 \u2192 row1: [0,0,5]\n\nColumn2:0,5,0 \u2192 row2: [0,5,0]\n\nSo the output matrix would be:\n\n[0,0,5]\n\n[0,0,5]\n\n[0,5,0]\n\nBut looking at the training examples, the outputs are all 3x3 matrices. But according to this pattern, the test input's output is as above.\n\nWait but let me check if there's any mistake here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I mixed up rows and columns during the transpose. Let's confirm:\n\nOriginal reversed matrix (after reversing each row):\n\nRow0:0,0,0\n\nRow1:0,0,5\n\nRow2:5,5,0\n\nTranspose of this matrix would have columns as rows:\n\nOriginal columns:\n\nC0: 0 (row0),0 (row1),5 (row2) \u2192 new row0: [0,0,5]\n\nC1:0 (row0),0 (row1),5 (row2) \u2192 new row1: [0,0,5]\n\nC2:0 (row0),5 (row1),0 (row2) \u2192 new row2: [0,5,0]\n\nYes, so that's correct.\n\nBut let me look back at the training examples to see if this matches the expected format.\n\nFor example, in Example1, the output was:\n\n[6,0,0]\n\n[6,0,6]\n\n[6,0,6]\n\nWhich aligns with the pattern we found.\n\nSo applying this to the test input, the output should be:\n\n[0,0,5]\n\n[0,0,5]\n\n[0,5,0]\n\nBut let me make sure. Let's see:\n\nOriginal input:\n\n[0,0,0]\n\n[5,0,0]\n\n[0,5,5]\n\nAfter reversing each row:\n\nRow0:0,0,0 \u2192 reversed same.\n\nRow1:5,0,0 \u2192 reversed 0,0,5.\n\nRow2:0,5,5 \u2192 reversed 5,5,0.\n\nSo the reversed matrix is:\n\nRow0:0,0,0\n\nRow1:0,0,5\n\nRow2:5,5,0\n\nTransposing this:\n\nEach column becomes a row.\n\nSo the first column is [0,0,5] \u2192 row0:0,0,5.\n\nSecond column is [0,0,5] \u2192 row1:0,0,5.\n\nThird column is [0,5,0] \u2192 row2:0,5,0.\n\nTherefore, the output should be:\n\n[0, 0, 5]\n\n[0, 0, 5]\n\n[0, 5, 0]\n\nBut let me check the format. The training examples use square brackets and commas. So the output should be in the same format.",

        "cot_2": "Okay, let's tackle this puzzle. So, I have these training examples where each input is a 3x3 grid of numbers, and the output is another 3x3 grid. My job is to figure out the pattern that transforms the input into the output and apply it to the test input.\n\nFirst, I'll look at each example and see if I can spot any obvious changes. Let's start with Example 0:\n\nInput:\n[9, 0, 0]\n[9, 9, 9]\n[9, 9, 9]\n\nOutput:\n[0, 9, 9]\n[0, 9, 9]\n[9, 9, 9]\n\nHmm. Comparing the input and output, the first row changes from [9,0,0] to [0,9,9]. The second row changes from [9,9,9] to [0,9,9], so the first element becomes 0. The third row stays the same. Wait, maybe there's some rotation or shifting happening here? Let's check another example.\n\nExample 1:\n\nInput:\n[6,6,6]\n[0,0,0]\n[6,6,0]\n\nOutput:\n[6,0,0]\n[6,0,6]\n[6,0,6]\n\nLooking at the input to output here. The first row becomes [6,0,0]. The second row [0,0,0] becomes [6,0,6]\u2014wait, no, the output's second row is [6,0,6]. Wait, maybe the columns are being rotated? Let me check the columns. Original first column is [6,0,6], output first column is [6,6,6]. Oh, maybe the columns are being shifted down?\n\nWait, in Example 0, the first column of input is [9,9,9], and the output's first column is [0,0,9]. So maybe each column is shifted down, and the top element is moved to the bottom? Let's see.\n\nOriginal input columns for Example 0:\nColumn 1: 9,9,9 \u2192 Output column 1: 0,0,9. Wait, that's not a shift. Alternatively, perhaps each column is rotated upwards, but the top element wraps around. Let's see:\n\nOriginal column 1 in Example 0 is [9,9,9]. If shifted up by one, it becomes [9,9,9] again. But the output's first column is [0,0,9]. That doesn't fit. Maybe something else.\n\nWait, maybe the rows are being rotated. Let's look at the rows. In Example 0, the first row becomes [0,9,9], which looks like the first element is moved to the end. Wait, [9,0,0] becomes [0,0,9] rotated? Wait no. The input first row is [9,0,0], output is [0,9,9]. Hmm. That's not a simple rotation. Maybe the elements are being shifted in a different way.\n\nLet me check another example. Example 2:\n\nInput:\n[0,0,9]\n[0,0,9]\n[9,9,9]\n\nOutput:\n[9,9,9]\n[0,0,9]\n[0,0,9]\n\nHere, the input's rows are reversed in the output. The first row becomes the third, second stays, third becomes first. Wait, no. Input rows are row0: [0,0,9], row1: [0,0,9], row2: [9,9,9]. Output rows are row0: [9,9,9], row1: [0,0,9], row2: [0,0,9]. So it looks like the rows are reversed. So the first row becomes the last, and the third becomes the first. But only for the first and third rows? Wait, original row0 becomes output row2, original row1 remains as row1, original row2 becomes row0. But that's not exactly a full reversal. Wait, original rows are 0,0,9; 0,0,9;9,9,9. Output is 9,9,9;0,0,9;0,0,9. So the first two rows of the input are swapped with the third? So maybe the entire grid is flipped vertically. Let me see: flipping the rows vertically would reverse the order. So input rows 0,1,2 become 2,1,0. So original row2 becomes output row0, original row1 remains row1, original row0 becomes row2. But in Example 2, that's exactly what happened. So the output is the input rows reversed. Let me check if that's the case for other examples.\n\nWait in Example 0, the input rows are:\n\nRow0: [9,0,0]\n\nRow1: [9,9,9]\n\nRow2: [9,9,9]\n\nOutput rows:\n\n[0,9,9], [0,9,9], [9,9,9]\n\nIf we reverse the rows, the output would be:\n\nRow0: [9,9,9] (original row2)\n\nRow1: [9,9,9] (original row1)\n\nRow2: [9,0,0] (original row0)\n\nBut that's not the case here. So maybe vertical flipping isn't the pattern here. Hmm.\n\nLet's look at Example 3:\n\nInput:\n\n[2,0,2]\n\n[0,0,2]\n\n[0,2,2]\n\nOutput:\n\n[2,2,2]\n\n[0,0,2]\n\n[2,0,0]\n\nSo input rows:\n\nRow0: 2,0,2\n\nRow1:0,0,2\n\nRow2:0,2,2\n\nOutput rows:\n\nRow0:2,2,2\n\nRow1:0,0,2\n\nRow2:2,0,0\n\nLooking at the output row2: 2,0,0. The original row0 was [2,0,2], and row2 was [0,2,2]. So maybe the rows are being rotated in some way. Let's see if there's another pattern.\n\nAnother approach: look at each position in the grid. Maybe each element is moving to a new position. For example, in Example 0, the input's top-left element is 9, which becomes 0 in the output's top-left. The input's (0,1) is 0, which becomes 9 in (0,0). Wait, perhaps each element is moving to the position to the right, and the last element wraps around to the next row? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each column is being shifted down. Let's check column 0 in Example 0. Input column 0: 9,9,9. Output column 0: 0,0,9. So maybe each element in the column is shifted down, and the top element becomes 0? Wait, shifting down would push each element down by one, and the bottom element wraps to the top. But in this case, shifting column 0 down would give [9 (from row2),9 (from row0),9 (from row1)]. But that's not the case here. The output column 0 is [0,0,9]. So maybe the top two elements are replaced with 0s, and the bottom stays. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each element is being replaced with the element from the row below. Like, row0 becomes row1, row1 becomes row2, and row2 becomes row0. Let's check Example 0. Original rows:\n\nRow0:9,0,0\n\nRow1:9,9,9\n\nRow2:9,9,9\n\nIf shifted down, row0 becomes row1's original elements: [9,9,9], row1 becomes row2's elements [9,9,9], row2 becomes row0's elements [9,0,0]. But the output is different. So that's not matching.\n\nAnother angle: look for the position of zeros. In Example 0's input, the first row has two zeros. In the output, the first column has two zeros. Maybe zeros are moving to the first column. Let's see:\n\nIn Example 0's output, the first column is [0,0,9], which has two zeros. The input's first column is [9,9,9]. So maybe zeros are being introduced in the first column. But how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation involves rotating each row to the left or right. For instance, in Example 0's first row [9,0,0], if rotated left once, it becomes [0,0,9]. But the output's first row is [0,9,9]. That's not matching. Rotating right once would give [0,9,0], which also doesn't match. Hmm.\n\nLooking at Example 1's input:\n\nInput:\n\n[6,6,6]\n\n[0,0,0]\n\n[6,6,0]\n\nOutput:\n\n[6,0,0]\n\n[6,0,6]\n\n[6,0,6]\n\nHere, the first row of the input is [6,6,6], output is [6,0,0]. Second row input [0,0,0] becomes [6,0,6]. Third row input [6,6,0] becomes [6,0,6]. Wait, maybe each row is being transformed by taking the first element and then some other elements. For example, in the first row of the output, it's [6 (from first element), 0,0]. The second row of output starts with 6, which wasn't in the input's second row. So this suggests that perhaps elements from other rows are being used.\n\nLooking at the first column of Example 1's input: [6,0,6]. The output's first column is [6,6,6], which is the same as the input's first column, but each element is 6. Wait, but input's first column is 6,0,6. Output first column is 6,6,6. So how did the 0s turn into 6s? Unless there's some pattern where each element in a column is replaced with the element above it. For example, in the first column, each element is replaced by the one above. So the first element (6) stays, the second element (0) becomes the first element (6), the third element (6) becomes the second element (0). But that would make the output first column [6,6,0], which doesn't match the output's [6,6,6]. Hmm, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each element, it's replaced with the element from the row below, and the bottom row wraps around to the top. Let's check Example 0:\n\nInput row0:9,0,0 \u2192 if replaced with row1's elements:9,9,9. But output row0 is 0,9,9. Doesn't match. So maybe not.\n\nAnother thought: perhaps the output is the transpose of the input matrix. Let's check. The transpose of a matrix swaps rows and columns. For Example 0, input is:\n\n9 0 0\n\n9 9 9\n\n9 9 9\n\nTranspose would be:\n\n9 9 9\n\n0 9 9\n\n0 9 9\n\nBut the output is:\n\n0 9 9\n\n0 9 9\n\n9 9 9\n\nNot the same. So transpose isn't it.\n\nLooking at Example 2 again:\n\nInput:\n\n0 0 9\n\n0 0 9\n\n9 9 9\n\nOutput:\n\n9 9 9\n\n0 0 9\n\n0 0 9\n\nThis looks like the rows are reversed. So row0 and row2 are swapped. Yes, the input's row2 is [9,9,9], which becomes output row0. Input row0 becomes output row2, and row1 remains the same. So this is a vertical flip. Let's see if that applies to other examples.\n\nIn Example 0, input rows are:\n\nRow0:9,0,0\n\nRow1:9,9,9\n\nRow2:9,9,9\n\nVertical flip would swap row0 and row2. So output would be:\n\nRow0:9,9,9\n\nRow1:9,9,9\n\nRow2:9,0,0\n\nBut the actual output is different. So that doesn't fit. So maybe vertical flip isn't the general rule.\n\nAnother approach: look for each example's transformation steps.\n\nLet's take Example 0 again.\n\nInput:\n\nRow0:9,0,0\n\nRow1:9,9,9\n\nRow2:9,9,9\n\nOutput:\n\nRow0:0,9,9\n\nRow1:0,9,9\n\nRow2:9,9,9\n\nHmm. The first two rows in the output start with 0. The original rows started with 9 and 9. So where did the 0s come from? Maybe the 0s from the first row's positions 1 and 2 (which are 0,0) are moving to the first column of the first two rows. But how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the first column of the output is formed by taking the first element of each row in the input, but shifted. For instance, in Example 0:\n\nInput first column: 9,9,9 \u2192 Output first column:0,0,9. If we shift the first column down by two positions, then 9 (row0) moves to row2, 9 (row1) moves to row0, and 9 (row2) moves to row1. But that gives [9,9,9], which isn't the case. Alternatively, maybe the first column in the output is the third column of the input. Let's check:\n\nInput third column is 0,9,9. But output first column is 0,0,9. Doesn't match.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output's first column is the reverse of the input's first column. Input first column [9,9,9] reversed is [9,9,9], which doesn't explain the 0s in the output.\n\nWait, maybe there's a pattern where the first element of each row is replaced by the number of zeros in that row. Let's check Example 0:\n\nRow0 has two zeros \u2192 first element becomes 2? But output is 0. Not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is created by shifting each row to the right and placing the first element at the end. For Example 0's first row [9,0,0], shifting right would make it [0,9,0], but output is [0,9,9]. Doesn't fit.\n\nAnother idea: Looking at the outputs, the bottom row remains the same in Example 0 and Example 2. In Example 0, the input's third row is the same as the output's third row. In Example 2, the input's third row [9,9,9] becomes the output's first row, but in Example 0, the third row stays the same. Wait, no. Hmm.\n\nWait, looking at Example 3's input and output:\n\nInput:\n\n[2,0,2]\n\n[0,0,2]\n\n[0,2,2]\n\nOutput:\n\n[2,2,2]\n\n[0,0,2]\n\n[2,0,0]\n\nThe output's third row is [2,0,0]. The input's first row is [2,0,2]. Maybe the output's third row is the first row of the input, but modified. Like, the first element is kept, but the rest are zeros? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each element in the output is the sum of the elements in the same column from the input, but modulo something. For Example 0:\n\nInput columns:\n\nColumn0:9,9,9 \u2192 sum 27. Output column0:0,0,9. Doesn't make sense.\n\nWait, maybe it's a matter of rotating the entire matrix 90 degrees. Let's check Example 2. Original input:\n\n0 0 9\n\n0 0 9\n\n9 9 9\n\nIf rotated 90 degrees clockwise, it becomes:\n\n9 0 0\n\n9 0 0\n\n9 9 9\n\nBut the output is:\n\n9 9 9\n\n0 0 9\n\n0 0 9\n\nWhich is not the same. So rotation doesn't explain it.\n\nAlternative approach: compare each position in input and output to see if there's a pattern in how each element moves.\n\nFor Example 0:\n\nInput:\n\nRow0: [9,0,0]\n\nRow1: [9,9,9]\n\nRow2: [9,9,9]\n\nOutput:\n\nRow0: [0,9,9]\n\nRow1: [0,9,9]\n\nRow2: [9,9,9]\n\nLooking at position (0,0) in input:9 \u2192 output:0.\n\n(0,1):0\u21929\n\n(0,2):0\u21929\n\nRow0's elements are transformed from [9,0,0] to [0,9,9]. So maybe each element in row0 is being replaced with the element to the right, and the first element becomes 0. So shifting right and adding 0 at the end? But shifting right would make [0,9,0], but output is [0,9,9]. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the first element of each row is moved to the end, and then the first position is set to 0. So for row0:9,0,0 \u2192 move 9 to end \u2192 0,0,9 \u2192 then set first to 0? But that would be 0,0,9, but output is 0,9,9. Not matching.\n\nWait, perhaps each row is being reversed. For example, row0 input [9,0,0] reversed is [0,0,9]. Output row0 is [0,9,9]. Doesn't match. Hmm.\n\nAnother angle: look at the number of zeros in each row. In Example 0's input, row0 has 2 zeros, row1 and 2 have none. In the output, row0 and row1 have one zero each (first element), and row2 has none. So perhaps the number of zeros is being adjusted in some way.\n\nIn Example 1's input:\n\nRow0:6,6,6 \u2192 no zeros.\n\nRow1:0,0,0 \u2192 three zeros.\n\nRow2:6,6,0 \u2192 one zero.\n\nOutput:\n\nRow0:6,0,0 \u2192 two zeros.\n\nRow1:6,0,6 \u2192 one zero.\n\nRow2:6,0,6 \u2192 one zero.\n\nSo the zeros are increasing in row0, decreasing in row1 and 2.\n\nNot sure how that fits.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each row is transformed by taking the non-zero elements and then appending zeros. For example, in Example0's row0: [9,0,0] \u2192 filter out zeros \u2192 [9], then append two zeros \u2192 but output row0 is [0,9,9]. Doesn't fit.\n\nAnother possible pattern: each element in the output is the element from the previous row and previous column. Like a diagonal shift. Let's see.\n\nIn Example0's output row0, column0:0. Maybe it's from the input row1, column0:9. Doesn't match.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each element is shifted to the position below and to the right. For example, output[0][0] is input[1][1]. Let's check:\n\nExample0's input[1][1] is 9. Output[0][0] is 0. Doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. Let's try to find a pattern that fits all examples.\n\nLooking at all examples, perhaps the transformation involves rotating the grid in a specific way and modifying certain elements.\n\nWait, in Example 0, the output's first two rows have their first element as 0. The input's first two rows have 9 and 9 as first elements. So maybe the first element of each row (except the last) is set to 0, and the rest are shifted.\n\nBut in Example1, input's first row starts with 6, output starts with 6. So that doesn't fit. So that's not the pattern.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps the output is formed by moving the last row to the top and shifting others down. In Example2, the last row is moved to the top. In Example0, the last two rows are the same. So output's first row is [0,9,9], which is not the same as the input's last row. So no.\n\nWait, in Example2's input, the first two rows are [0,0,9], third row is [9,9,9]. The output has the third row first, then the first two rows. So it's a vertical flip. That works for Example2, but not for the others.\n\nSo perhaps vertical flip is part of the pattern but combined with other operations.\n\nLooking at Example3:\n\nInput:\n\nRow0:2,0,2\n\nRow1:0,0,2\n\nRow2:0,2,2\n\nOutput:\n\nRow0:2,2,2\n\nRow1:0,0,2\n\nRow2:2,0,0\n\nHere, the output's row0 is [2,2,2], which is the input's row2's elements [0,2,2] but modified. Not sure.\n\nWait, maybe the output is created by taking the third row of the input and making it the first row, then shifting other rows down, but modified in some way. Not sure.\n\nAlternative approach: look for each example's transformation as a combination of operations. For example, in Example0, the output's first two rows have their first elements replaced with 0, and the rest shifted. Let's see:\n\nOriginal row0:9,0,0 \u2192 output row0:0,9,9. So first element becomes 0, and then the next two elements are 9 and 9. Where do the 9s come from? The input's row0 has 0s in the second and third positions, but output has 9s. So maybe taking the elements from the row below. Row0's 9,0,0 becomes 0 (from the first element changed to 0), then the next two elements are taken from row1's first and second elements (9,9). So output row0 would be [0,9,9]. Similarly, row1's first element becomes 0, and the next elements from row2's first and second (9,9). So output row1 is [0,9,9]. Row2 remains the same. This seems to fit Example0.\n\nExample1:\n\nInput:\n\nRow0:6,6,6\n\nRow1:0,0,0\n\nRow2:6,6,0\n\nOutput:\n\nRow0:6,0,0 \u2192 first element is 6 (original row0's first element?), but according to the previous idea, the first element should be 0 (from row1's first element). Wait, no. Because in Example0, the first element of row0 in output is 0, which was not from row0's first element. Hmm. So this idea may not hold.\n\nWait, let's re-examine Example0. Output row0:0,9,9. The 9,9 could be from row1's elements. So perhaps each row (except the last) is transformed by taking the first element as 0, and the next elements from the row below.\n\nSo for row0 in Example0, after setting first element to 0, the next elements are row1's first two elements:9 and9. So row0 becomes [0,9,9].\n\nRow1 would then take its first element as 0, and next elements from row2's first two:9 and9 \u2192 [0,9,9]. Row2 remains as is.\n\nIf this is the case, let's test it on Example1.\n\nExample1's input:\n\nRow0:6,6,6\n\nRow1:0,0,0\n\nRow2:6,6,0\n\nOutput should be:\n\nRow0:0,0,0's first two elements? Wait, no. According to the pattern, row0's first element is 0 (from where?), and the next two elements are from row1's first and second elements. So row0 becomes [0,0,0]. But the actual output row0 is [6,0,0]. So this doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. So maybe that's not the pattern.\n\nAnother thought: maybe the output grid is created by shifting each column down by one, and the topmost element is replaced with 0. Let's test this.\n\nFor Example0's column0:\n\nInput column0:9,9,9. Shifting down by one would give:\n\nThe new column0 would be [0 (new top),9 (from original top),9 (from original middle)]. So output column0:0,9,9. But the output's column0 is [0,0,9]. So that doesn't fit.\n\nWait, perhaps shifting down by two. Then column0 becomes [9 (original row2), 9 (original row0),9 (original row1)]. Not matching.\n\nAlternatively, each column is shifted down, and the element that wraps around is replaced with 0.\n\nFor Example0's column0:\n\nShift down by 1. Original elements:9,9,9. Shifted down, the bottom element (9) moves to the top. Then replace that with 0. So new column0 would be [0,9,9]. Which matches the output's column0:0,0,9. No, that doesn't fit. The output's column0 has two 0s.\n\nHmm. This is tricky.\n\nLet me look at Example3's input and output again.\n\nInput:\n\nRow0:2,0,2\n\nRow1:0,0,2\n\nRow2:0,2,2\n\nOutput:\n\nRow0:2,2,2\n\nRow1:0,0,2\n\nRow2:2,0,0\n\nThe output's row0 is [2,2,2]. The input's row2 is [0,2,2]. So maybe row0 of the output is row2 of the input but with first element changed to 2. Original row2's first element is 0. Output row0's first is 2. Where did that come from?\n\nAlternatively, maybe each row in the output is the row below it from the input, but with some changes. For instance, output row0 is input row1, and output row1 is input row2. But in Example3's input, output row0 is [2,2,2], which doesn't match input row1: [0,0,2]. So that's not it.\n\nAnother angle: the output's last row in Example3 is [2,0,0], which is input's row0's elements [2,0,2] but with the last element set to 0. Maybe some kind of rotation with modifications.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that each row is shifted right by one, and the first element is replaced with the last element of the previous row. Let's see:\n\nExample0's input rows:\n\nRow0:9,0,0\n\nRow1:9,9,9\n\nRow2:9,9,9\n\nShifting row0 right by one:0,9,0. Then replace first element with the last element of the previous row (which is row2's last element, 9). So row0 becomes [9,9,0]. But output row0 is [0,9,9]. Not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each element is moved diagonally. For example, element (i,j) becomes (i-1,j+1), with wrap-around. Let's see:\n\nIn Example0's element (0,0) =9 \u2192 would move to (2,1) (since i-1 is -1 \u2192 wraps to 2, j+1=1). Output (2,1) is 9. Input (0,0) is 9, output (2,1) is 9. Not sure if this holds.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Maybe I should look for another approach.\n\nLooking at Example0 and Example2, both involve the number 9. But not sure if that's relevant.\n\nAnother idea: look at the movement of specific elements. For instance, in Example0's input, the two zeros in row0 move to the first two positions of the first two rows in the output. So input row0 has zeros in positions 1 and 2, and output's column0 has two zeros. Maybe zeros are moving from rows to columns.\n\nIn Example0, input row0 has zeros at positions 1 and 2. Output columns0 has two zeros in rows0 and 1. So maybe the zeros are being transposed into the first column.\n\nSimilarly, in Example1's input, row1 has three zeros. The output's column1 has zeros in all three rows. For example, output column1 is [0,0,0], which matches the input row1's zeros. So maybe the zeros are being moved from rows to columns.\n\nBut let's check Example1's input:\n\nRow0:6,6,6 \u2192 no zeros.\n\nRow1:0,0,0 \u2192 three zeros.\n\nRow2:6,6,0 \u2192 one zero.\n\nOutput:\n\nRow0:6,0,0\n\nRow1:6,0,6\n\nRow2:6,0,6\n\nOutput column1 is [0,0,0]. So the zeros from input row1 are now in column1. The zero from row2's third position is now in row0's third position. So maybe the zeros are being placed into the same column as their original row's index. For example, input row1's zeros are moved to column1.\n\nSimilarly, in Example0, input row0's two zeros are in row0, so they would move to column0. But output's column0 has two zeros. So that fits.\n\nIn Example2:\n\nInput rows:\n\nRow0:0,0,9\n\nRow1:0,0,9\n\nRow2:9,9,9\n\nZeros are in rows0 and 1, columns0 and1.\n\nOutput column0 has zeros in rows0 and1 (but the output is [9,9,9], [0,0,9], [0,0,9]. Wait, output column0 is [9,0,0]. So zeros are in rows1 and2 of column0. But the original zeros were in rows0 and1. So this doesn't fit the previous idea.\n\nHmm.\n\nAnother observation: in all examples, the number of zeros in the input equals the number of zeros in the output. Let's check:\n\nExample0 input: 2 zeros. Output: 2 zeros in the first column. Yes.\n\nExample1 input: 3 (row1) +1 (row2) =4 zeros. Output: row0 has 2, row1 has 1, row2 has 1. Total 4. Yes.\n\nExample2 input: 2 zeros in row0, 2 in row1 \u2192 total 4. Output: zeros in row1 and row2, column0 and1. 2 zeros in row1, 2 in row2 \u2192 total 4.\n\nExample3 input: row0 has 1, row1 has 2, row2 has 1 \u2192 total 4. Output: row0 has 0, row1 has 2, row2 has 2 \u2192 total 4. Yes.\n\nSo the number of zeros is preserved. So the transformation is a permutation of the elements, perhaps.\n\nSo zeros are moving to different positions, but the count remains the same.\n\nIf that's the case, maybe the transformation is a specific permutation of elements. For example, rotating the matrix or shifting elements in a certain way.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps the entire matrix is rotated 90 degrees, and then the first row is modified. But I checked that earlier and it didn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the matrix is rotated 180 degrees. Let's check Example0:\n\nInput:\n\n9 0 0\n\n9 9 9\n\n9 9 9\n\nRotated 180 degrees would be:\n\n9 9 9\n\n9 9 9\n\n0 0 9\n\nBut the output is:\n\n0 9 9\n\n0 9 9\n\n9 9 9\n\nNot matching.\n\nAnother approach: For each example, see if the output can be derived by taking the input and performing a specific row-wise and column-wise operation.\n\nLooking at Example0's output:\n\nFirst column is [0,0,9]. Original first column was [9,9,9]. So each element in the first column except the last has become 0. In Example1's output, first column is [6,6,6], which is the same as the input's first column [6,0,6] but modified. So not sure.\n\nWait, in Example1's input, first column is [6,0,6]. Output first column is [6,6,6]. So all elements are 6. How did that happen? Perhaps each element in the first column is replaced with the maximum value in that column. Input column0 has 6,0,6. Max is 6. So output column0 is all 6s. For Example0's column0:9,9,9 \u2192 max is9. But output column0 is [0,0,9]. Doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the first column is the sum of the other columns. Not sure.\n\nAnother possible pattern: The output is the mirror image of the input along the vertical axis. For example, each row is reversed. Let's check Example0:\n\nInput row0:9,0,0 \u2192 reversed is0,0,9. Output row0 is0,9,9. Not matching.\n\nHmm. I'm stuck. Let's try to find a pattern that works across all examples.\n\nLooking at all four examples again:\n\nExample0:\n\nInput rows:\n\n[9,0,0]\n\n[9,9,9]\n\n[9,9,9]\n\nOutput rows:\n\n[0,9,9]\n\n[0,9,9]\n\n[9,9,9]\n\nExample1:\n\nInput:\n\n[6,6,6]\n\n[0,0,0]\n\n[6,6,0]\n\nOutput:\n\n[6,0,0]\n\n[6,0,6]\n\n[6,0,6]\n\nExample2:\n\nInput:\n\n[0,0,9]\n\n[0,0,9]\n\n[9,9,9]\n\nOutput:\n\n[9,9,9]\n\n[0,0,9]\n\n[0,0,9]\n\nExample3:\n\nInput:\n\n[2,0,2]\n\n[0,0,2]\n\n[0,2,2]\n\nOutput:\n\n[2,2,2]\n\n[0,0,2]\n\n[2,0,0]\n\nNow, looking for a common transformation:\n\nIn Example2, the output is the input rows in reverse order. So first input row becomes third output row, second input row becomes second, third becomes first. But this only applies to Example2. Other examples don't follow this.\n\nIn Example3, the output's first row is [2,2,2], which is the same as the input's third row but modified. The third row of the input is [0,2,2]. So not sure.\n\nWait, in Example3's output, the first row is [2,2,2], which resembles the third column of the input. Let's check:\n\nInput's third column is:\n\nRow0:2\n\nRow1:2\n\nRow2:2\n\nSo the third column is all 2s. So output row0 is [2,2,2], which is the third column as a row. Maybe the output is the transpose of the input for some examples. But in Example2, the third column of the input is 9,9,9, which becomes the first row of the output. So transpose works for Example2, but not for others.\n\nAnother idea: the output is created by rotating the columns. For example, each column is rotated upward by one. Let's check Example0's columns:\n\nOriginal column0:9,9,9. Rotated up by one:9,9,9 \u2192 same. But output column0 is 0,0,9. So that's not it.\n\nAlternatively, each column is rotated downward by one. Original column0 becomes 9 (from row2),9 (row0),9 (row1). Still 9,9,9. Not matching.\n\nHmm. This is really challenging. Let's think differently. Maybe the transformation is applied to each row individually. Let's look for row-wise patterns.\n\nIn Example0, row0 input [9,0,0] \u2192 output [0,9,9]. The 9 is moved to the end, and zeros are replaced with 9s? Or maybe the 9 is kept, and the zeros become 9s. But how?\n\nWait, in Example0's output row0, the elements are 0,9,9. The input row0 has 9,0,0. So 9 is replaced with 0, and the two zeros are replaced with 9s. So maybe a substitution: 9\u21920 and 0\u21929. But in Example1's row0, input is [6,6,6], output is [6,0,0]. So 6 remains, and the other two are replaced with 0. But why?\n\nAlternatively, the first element of each row is set to 0 if it's not already 0. But in Example0's row0, first element is 9 \u2192 becomes 0. In Example1's row0, first element is 6 \u2192 remains 6. Example3's input row0 first element is 2 \u2192 output row0 first element is 2. So that doesn't fit. So no.\n\nAnother idea: For each row, the first element is swapped with the next element that is not equal to it. For example, in Example0's row0, the first element is 9. The next elements are 0 and 0. So swap with the first 0, resulting in 0,9,0. But output row0 is 0,9,9. Not matching.\n\nAlternatively, the first element is replaced with 0, and the rest are filled with the maximum value from the row. For Example0's row0, max is9. So 0,9,9. That fits. For Example1's row0, max is6. So 0,6,6. But output row0 is [6,0,0]. Doesn't fit.\n\nWait, but in Example1's output row0, the first element is 6. So maybe this idea is incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, the first element of each row is replaced with 0 except for the last row. So in Example0, row0 and row1's first elements become 0. Row2 remains. Example1's row0's first element is 6, which remains. But why? Because in Example1, the first element of row0 is 6, which isn't changed. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAnother approach: Looking at the outputs, it seems that each row after transformation starts with the same element as the row below it in the input. For Example0:\n\nRow0 in output starts with 0. Row1 in input starts with 9. Doesn't match.\n\nExample1:\n\nRow0 output starts with 6. Row1 input starts with 0. Doesn't match.\n\nHmm. Not helpful.\n\nMaybe the output rows are derived from the input columns. For example, the first output row is the first input column reversed. Let's check Example0:\n\nInput column0:9,9,9 \u2192 reversed is9,9,9. Output row0 is [0,9,9]. Doesn't match.\n\nExample2's input column0:0,0,9 \u2192 reversed is9,0,0. Output row0 is [9,9,9]. No.\n\nAlternatively, the output's first row is the first column of the input, but modified. For Example0, input column0 is 9,9,9 \u2192 output row0 is 0,9,9. So first element is 0, others are 9. How?\n\nMaybe the first element of the column is replaced with 0. So input column0 becomes [0,9,9], which becomes the first row of the output. Then, the output's second row would be the second column of the input. Let's check:\n\nExample0's input column1 is0,9,9. Output row1 is0,9,9. Which matches. Input column2 is0,9,9. Output row2 is9,9,9. So no. But the output's row2 is [9,9,9], which matches input's row2.\n\nSo for Example0:\n\nOutput row0 is input column0 with first element 0 \u2192 [0,9,9].\n\nOutput row1 is input column1 \u2192 [0,9,9].\n\nOutput row2 is input row2 \u2192 [9,9,9].\n\nThis seems to fit Example0.\n\nLet's check Example2:\n\nInput:\n\nRow0:0,0,9\n\nRow1:0,0,9\n\nRow2:9,9,9\n\nColumns:\n\nCol0:0,0,9 \u2192 reversed or modified to become output row0:9,9,9.\n\nCol1:0,0,9 \u2192 output row1:0,0,9.\n\nCol2:9,9,9 \u2192 output row2:0,0,9.\n\nWait, no. Output is:\n\n[9,9,9]\n\n[0,0,9]\n\n[0,0,9]\n\nSo output row0 is input column0 reversed? [0,0,9] reversed is9,0,0. No. But output row0 is [9,9,9]. Hmm.\n\nAnother possibility: output rows are the input columns in reverse order. For example, output row0 is input column2, row1 is column1, row2 is column0.\n\nFor Example0:\n\nInput columns:\n\nCol0:9,9,9 \u2192 output row2:9,9,9.\n\nCol1:0,9,9 \u2192 output row1:0,9,9.\n\nCol2:0,9,9 \u2192 output row0:0,9,9.\n\nWhich matches the output of Example0:\n\nRow0:0,9,9\n\nRow1:0,9,9\n\nRow2:9,9,9\n\nYes! So output rows are the input columns in reverse order. So output row0 is input column2, row1 is input column1, row2 is input column0.\n\nLet's verify with other examples.\n\nExample1:\n\nInput columns:\n\nCol0:6,0,6\n\nCol1:6,0,6\n\nCol2:6,0,0\n\nOutput should be:\n\nRow0: column2 of input \u21926,0,0 \u2192 output row0 is [6,0,0] which matches.\n\nRow1: column1 of input \u21926,0,6 \u2192 output row1 is [6,0,6], which matches.\n\nRow2: column0 of input \u21926,0,6 \u2192 output row2 is [6,0,6], which matches.\n\nYes! This fits Example1.\n\nExample2:\n\nInput columns:\n\nCol0:0,0,9\n\nCol1:0,0,9\n\nCol2:9,9,9\n\nOutput should be:\n\nRow0: column2 \u21929,9,9 \u2192 matches output row0.\n\nRow1: column1 \u21920,0,9 \u2192 matches output row1.\n\nRow2: column0 \u21920,0,9 \u2192 matches output row2.\n\nYes! This works for Example2.\n\nExample3:\n\nInput columns:\n\nCol0:2,0,0\n\nCol1:0,0,2\n\nCol2:2,2,2\n\nOutput should be:\n\nRow0: column2 \u21922,2,2 \u2192 matches output row0.\n\nRow1: column1 \u21920,0,2 \u2192 matches output row1.\n\nRow2: column0 \u21922,0,0 \u2192 which should be output row2. But the actual output row2 is [2,0,0], which matches.\n\nYes! So the pattern is that the output is formed by taking the input's columns in reverse order and making them the rows of the output. In other words, the output is the transpose of the input matrix's columns in reverse order.\n\nTransposing the matrix's columns in reverse order is equivalent to rotating the matrix 90 degrees to the right (clockwise), but let's confirm.\n\nA 90-degree clockwise rotation would transpose the matrix and reverse the rows. But here, we're transposing the columns in reverse order. Let's see:\n\nFor Example0:\n\nOriginal matrix:\n\n9 0 0\n\n9 9 9\n\n9 9 9\n\nTransposing would give:\n\n9 9 9\n\n0 9 9\n\n0 9 9\n\nThen reversing the rows (for 90-degree rotation) would give:\n\n0 9 9\n\n0 9 9\n\n9 9 9\n\nWhich matches the output. So the pattern is a 90-degree clockwise rotation.\n\nAh! So the pattern is to rotate the input matrix 90 degrees clockwise.\n\nLet's confirm this for all examples.\n\nExample1's input:\n\n6 6 6\n\n0 0 0\n\n6 6 0\n\nRotating 90 degrees clockwise:\n\nOriginal rows:\n\nRow0:6,6,6\n\nRow1:0,0,0\n\nRow2:6,6,0\n\nTranspose (columns become rows):\n\n6 0 6\n\n6 0 6\n\n6 0 0\n\nThen reverse each row (for 90-degree rotation):\n\n6 0 6 \u2192 reversed \u21926 0 6 (no change)\n\n6 0 6 \u2192 reversed \u21926 0 6 (no change)\n\n6 0 0 \u2192 reversed \u21920 0 6 \u2192 but the actual output's row0 is [6,0,0]. Wait, this doesn't fit.\n\nWait, maybe I'm mixing up the rotation steps. Rotating a matrix 90 degrees clockwise involves two steps: transpose and then reverse each row.\n\nFor Example1:\n\nOriginal matrix:\n\n6 6 6\n\n0 0 0\n\n6 6 0\n\nTranspose gives:\n\n6 0 6\n\n6 0 6\n\n6 0 0\n\nNow reverse each row:\n\nRow0:6 0 6 \u2192 reverse \u21926 0 6 (same as original)\n\nRow1:6 0 6 \u2192 reverse \u21926 0 6\n\nRow2:6 0 0 \u2192 reverse \u21920 0 6\n\nBut the expected output is:\n\n[6,0,0]\n\n[6,0,6]\n\n[6,0,6]\n\nSo after rotation, the matrix becomes:\n\n6 0 6\n\n6 0 6\n\n0 0 6\n\nWhich does not match the expected output. So perhaps the rotation is different.\n\nWait, maybe it's a 90-degree counter-clockwise rotation. Let's check that.\n\nFor a counter-clockwise rotation, you reverse each row first, then transpose.\n\nExample1:\n\nOriginal matrix:\n\n6 6 6\n\n0 0 0\n\n6 6 0\n\nReverse each row:\n\n6 6 6 \u21926 6 6\n\n0 0 0 \u21920 0 0\n\n0 6 6 \u21926 6 0 reversed.\n\nTranspose:\n\n6 0 0\n\n6 0 6\n\n6 0 6\n\nWhich matches the output:\n\nRow0:6 0 0\n\nRow1:6 0 6\n\nRow2:6 0 6\n\nYes! So the pattern is a 90-degree counter-clockwise rotation.\n\nLet's verify this for Example0.\n\nExample0's input:\n\n9 0 0\n\n9 9 9\n\n9 9 9\n\nReverse each row:\n\n9 0 0 \u21920 0 9\n\n9 9 9 \u21929 9 9\n\n9 9 9 \u21929 9 9\n\nTranspose:\n\n0 9 9\n\n0 9 9\n\n9 9 9\n\nWhich matches the output. So the pattern is to rotate the matrix 90 degrees counter-clockwise.\n\nLet's check Example2:\n\nInput:\n\n0 0 9\n\n0 0 9\n\n9 9 9\n\nReverse each row:\n\n9 0 0\n\n9 0 0\n\n9 9 9\n\nTranspose:\n\n9 9 9\n\n0 0 9\n\n0 0 9\n\nWhich matches the output.\n\nExample3:\n\nInput:\n\n2 0 2\n\n0 0 2\n\n0 2 2\n\nReverse each row:\n\n2 0 2 \u21922 0 2 (same)\n\n2 0 0 \u21920 0 2\n\n2 2 0 \u21920 2 2 (wait, original row is [0,2,2], reversed becomes 2,2,0. But the input's row2 is [0,2,2], reversed is 2,2,0.\n\nThen transpose:\n\n2 0 2\n\n0 0 2\n\n2 2 0 \u2192 wait, after reversing each row:\n\nRow0:2,0,2 (same as input)\n\nRow1:0,0,2 reversed \u21922,0,0\n\nRow2:0,2,2 reversed \u21922,2,0\n\nTransposing these rows would give columns:\n\n2,2,2\n\n0,0,2\n\n2,0,0\n\nWhich matches the output:\n\n[2,2,2]\n\n[0,0,2]\n\n[2,0,0]\n\nYes! So the pattern is that each input matrix is rotated 90 degrees counter-clockwise. To do this, you reverse each row and then transpose the matrix.\n\nNow, applying this to the test input:\n\nTest Input:\n\n[0,0,0]\n\n[5,0,0]\n\n[0,5,5]\n\nSo we need to rotate this 90 degrees counter-clockwise.\n\nStep 1: Reverse each row.\n\nRow0:0,0,0 \u2192 reversed \u21920,0,0\n\nRow1:5,0,0 \u2192 reversed \u21920,0,5\n\nRow2:0,5,5 \u2192 reversed \u21925,5,0\n\nSo after reversing rows:\n\n[0,0,0]\n\n[0,0,5]\n\n[5,5,0]\n\nStep 2: Transpose the matrix. The transpose is formed by turning rows into columns.\n\nOriginal rows after reversal:\n\nRow0:0,0,0\n\nRow1:0,0,5\n\nRow2:5,5,0\n\nTransposed matrix:\n\nColumn0:0,0,5 \u2192 becomes row0:0,0,5\n\nColumn1:0,0,5 \u2192 becomes row1:0,0,5\n\nColumn2:0,5,0 \u2192 becomes row2:0,5,0\n\nSo the transposed matrix is:\n\n[0,0,5]\n\n[0,0,5]\n\n[0,5,0]\n\nBut wait, this doesn't seem right. Let me recompute the transpose.\n\nThe original matrix after reversing each row is:\n\nRow0: 0 0 0\n\nRow1: 0 0 5\n\nRow2:5 5 0\n\nTo transpose, each element at (i,j) becomes (j,i).\n\nSo the new row0 will be the first element of each original row:\n\nRow0:0 (from Row0, col0), 0 (Row1, col0),5 (Row2, col0) \u2192 [0,0,5]\n\nRow1:0 (Row0, col1),0 (Row1, col1),5 (Row2, col1) \u2192 [0,0,5]\n\nRow2:0 (Row0, col2),5 (Row1, col2),0 (Row2, col2) \u2192 [0,5,0]\n\nSo the output matrix after transposing is:\n\n[0,0,5]\n\n[0,0,5]\n\n[0,5,0]\n\nBut the expected output format is rows as in the examples. So the final output should be:\n\n[0,0,5]\n\n[0,0,5]\n\n[0,5,0]\n\nBut wait, looking back at the examples, the outputs are written as three rows. So applying the rotation correctly, this should be the answer."
