        "cot_1": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. So, looking at the training examples, the input is a list of lists (arrays) and the output is another list of lists. Let me go through each example one by one.\n\nStarting with Example 0:\nInput:\n[1, 1, 1]\n[2, 2, 2]\n[1, 1, 1]\n\nOutput:\n[1]\n[2]\n[1]\n\nHmm, so each input row has the same numbers repeated. The output for each row is just a single instance of that number. So maybe the pattern is to remove duplicates in each row, but only if all elements are the same. Wait, but in Example 0, all elements in a row are the same, so output is just [x]. But let's check other examples.\n\nExample 1:\nInput:\n[3,4,6]\n[3,4,6]\n[3,4,6]\n\nOutput:\n[3,4,6]\n\nHere, all three rows are the same. The output is the same as the input row. Wait, but each row is identical. Wait, in this case, the output is the same as each input row. But why? Because in example 0, when the rows are alternating between the same elements, the outputs are the single elements. But here, all rows are the same, but the output is the entire row. So maybe the pattern isn't just about individual rows. Wait, maybe the output is taking the unique elements from each row, but only if the row is duplicated in the input. Wait, maybe each output row is the unique elements of the corresponding input row, but only if that row appears multiple times? Let me check.\n\nWait, example 0 has three rows. The first and third are [1,1,1], the second is [2,2,2]. The output has [1], [2], [1]. So each row in the output is the unique element of the input row. So for any row where all elements are the same, the output is a single element. But in example 1, all input rows are [3,4,6]. The output is [3,4,6]. So why isn't it just a single row? Because in example 1, the output is the same as each input row. Wait, but in example 0, the output rows are each a single element. So maybe the pattern is: For each row in the input, if the row consists of all the same elements, then the output row is just that element once. Otherwise, if the row has varying elements, then in the output, remove consecutive duplicates but leave the elements as they are, but only if the entire row is duplicated multiple times. Wait, example 1's input has three identical rows of [3,4,6], but the output is just [3,4,6]. But each input row isn't all the same element. So maybe the output is taking each row and removing duplicates in some way.\n\nWait, looking at example 2:\n\nInput:\n[2,3,3,8,1]\n[2,3,3,8,1]\n[2,3,3,8,1]\n\nOutput:\n[2,3,8,1]\n\nThe input rows are all the same. The output is the same array but with consecutive duplicates removed. The original array has 2,3,3,8,1. The 3 is consecutive, so it's reduced to one 3. So the output is [2,3,8,1]. So here, the output is the input row with consecutive duplicates removed, but only if the entire row is duplicated multiple times? Because in example 2, all three rows are the same, so the output is the deduplicated version. Whereas in example 0 and 3, when the row consists of all same elements, the output is a single element. Let's check example 3.\n\nExample 3 input:\n[2,2]\n[6,6]\n[8,8]\n[8,8]\n\nOutput:\n[2]\n[6]\n[8]\n\nEach input row is two same elements. Output is single element. So in this case, even though the last two rows are [8,8], each row is processed individually. The output for each is [8], but since there are two [8,8] rows, the output has two [8] rows. So the pattern here is: For each row in the input, if all elements in the row are the same, output a list with that element once. Otherwise, if the row has varying elements, but the entire row is duplicated (appears multiple times consecutively?), then output the row with consecutive duplicates removed.\n\nWait, example 1's input has three identical rows [3,4,6], which have varying elements. The output is a single row [3,4,6]. But according to example 2, when all input rows are the same, the output is the deduplicated version of that row. But in example 1, the output is the same as the input row. Hmm, maybe that's not the case. Let me see.\n\nWait example 2's input rows are all [2,3,3,8,1], and the output is [2,3,8,1], which is the input row with consecutive duplicates removed. So if all the input rows are the same, then the output is the deduplicated version of the row. But example 1's input rows are all [3,4,6], but the output is the same as the input. But in example 1, the input row [3,4,6] doesn't have any consecutive duplicates. So when all input rows are the same, the output is the row with consecutive duplicates removed. So if there are no consecutive duplicates, it remains the same.\n\nSo the rule seems to be: For each group of consecutive identical rows in the input, the output will have a single row. That row is the input row with consecutive duplicates removed. Also, if all elements in a row are the same, then the output row is just a single element. Wait, but how to reconcile example 0 and example 3?\n\nIn example 0, the input has three rows: [1s], [2s], [1s]. The output is three rows: [1], [2], [1]. So each row is processed individually. Because the first and third rows are not consecutive. So the consecutive identical rows are grouped. So in example 3, the input is [2,2], [6,6], [8,8], [8,8]. So the first two rows are different. Then two [8,8] rows. So the output is [2], [6], [8]. Because the two [8,8] rows are consecutive, so they are grouped into one row. Wait, but the output of example 3 is [2], [6], [8]. So the input has four rows, output three. Because the two [8,8] rows are consecutive, so they are merged into one [8] row. Similarly, in example 4:\n\nInput:\n[4,4,4,4]\n[4,4,4,4]\n[2,2,2,2]\n[2,2,2,2]\n[8,8,8,8]\n[3,3,3,3]\n\nOutput:\n[4]\n[2]\n[8]\n[3]\n\nSo each consecutive group of identical rows is merged into one row. And each such row is processed by taking the first element (since all elements are same). So the rule is: For each group of consecutive identical rows in the input, create one row in the output. The output row is the input row with consecutive duplicates removed. But for rows where all elements are the same, the output is a single element. If the row has varying elements but consecutive duplicates, then those are merged. And grouping is done based on consecutive identical rows.\n\nSo in the test input:\n\nTest input:\n[1,1,2,3,3,3,8,8,4]\n[1,1,2,3,3,3,8,8,4]\n[1,1,2,3,3,3,8,8,4]\n[1,1,2,3,3,3,8,8,4]\n\nSo these are four consecutive identical rows. So according to the pattern, the output should be a single row. The input row is [1,1,2,3,3,3,8,8,4]. So first, process this row by removing consecutive duplicates. Let's see:\n\nOriginal row: 1,1,2,3,3,3,8,8,4.\n\nConsecutive duplicates: The first two 1s \u2192 keep one. Then 2 is single. Then three 3s \u2192 keep one. Then two 8s \u2192 keep one. Then 4 is single. So after deduplicating consecutive elements, the row becomes [1,2,3,8,4].\n\nSince all four input rows are consecutive and identical, the output is one row: [1,2,3,8,4].\n\nBut wait, looking back at the examples:\n\nIn example 1, three identical rows of [3,4,6] \u2192 output is the same as the input row. Because when deduplicating consecutive elements, there are none. So the deduplicated version is the same as the input. So output [3,4,6].\n\nIn example 2, three identical rows of [2,3,3,8,1], deduplicated to [2,3,8,1], so output is that.\n\nIn the test case, the four identical rows would be merged into one row which is the deduplicated version of the input row. So the output should be [1,2,3,8,4], as per the consecutive duplicates removal.\n\nSo the answer would be a single row:\n\n[1,2,3,8,4]\n\nBut wait, let's check the training examples again. For example 0, the input has three rows: two [1,1,1] and one [2,2,2] in between. So the output is three rows. Because the consecutive groups are first [1,1,1], then [2,2,2], then [1,1,1], each as separate groups. So in that case, each group is processed into a single element, hence three rows.\n\nSo the key is that consecutive identical rows are grouped into a single output row. The output row is the input row with consecutive duplicates removed. Also, if the row is made of the same element, then the output is just that element once.\n\nSo applying this to the test input:\n\nTest input has four consecutive identical rows. So group them into one. Then process that row by removing consecutive duplicates. The original row is [1,1,2,3,3,3,8,8,4]. Consecutive duplicates are the 1s, 3s, and 8s. So removing them gives [1,2,3,8,4]. So the output should be:\n\n[1,2,3,8,4]\n\nBut wait, the test input is four identical rows, so according to the pattern, the output would have one row, which is the deduplicated version of the input row.\n\nLooking at the training examples, when there are multiple consecutive identical rows, the output has one row per group. So yes, the test case's output should be a single row [1,2,3,8,4].",

        "cot_2": "Okay, let's see. I need to figure out the pattern that transforms the input lists into the output lists in the training examples. Let me go through each example one by one.\n\nStarting with Example 0:\nInput has three identical rows: [1,1,1], [2,2,2], [1,1,1]. The output is each row reduced to a single element: [1], [2], [1]. So maybe they're taking the unique element from each row since all elements in a row are the same.\n\nExample 1:\nAll rows are the same: [3,4,6]. The output is [3,4,6]. Wait, but why isn't it just a single element? Because in the first example, each row had the same elements, but here the output is the entire row. Hmm. Maybe the pattern is different. Wait, looking at the output of example 1, the input rows are identical, and the output is the same as any of the input rows. But example 0 had different rows (first and third are same, middle different), and each output was a single element. So perhaps when all rows are the same, the output is that row but with duplicates removed in some way? Wait, example 1's input is [3,4,6] repeated, but the output is the same as the input. But in example 2, the input is three rows of [2,3,3,8,1], and the output is [2,3,8,1]. Oh, that's removing duplicates within each row. Like, each row in example 2 has duplicates of 3, so the output row removes the duplicate 3. So maybe the transformation is: for each row, remove consecutive duplicates, keeping only the first occurrence. Wait, let's check.\n\nIn example 2's input row: [2,3,3,8,1]. The output is [2,3,8,1]. So the two 3s are consecutive, and one is removed. So that's deduplicated by collapsing consecutive duplicates. Similarly, in example 3's input rows: [2,2] becomes [2], [6,6] becomes [6], etc. So for each row, consecutive duplicates are removed, leaving one instance.\n\nThen, looking at example 1: the input rows are [3,4,6], which have no consecutive duplicates, so the output is the same as the input. So that fits. Example 0's input rows are all same elements, so when deduped, each becomes a single element.\n\nSo the pattern seems to be: for each row, remove consecutive duplicate elements, leaving only the first occurrence. Then, if all the rows are the same (like in example 1, 2, 3, 4?), but wait, example 4's input has multiple rows, each being the same as others in their group. Wait, let's check example 4. The input has four rows: two [4,4,4,4], then two [2,2,2,2], then [8,8,8,8], then [3,3,3,3]. The output is each row deduped to [4], [2], [8], [3]. So each row is processed individually, regardless of other rows. So the transformation is applied to each row separately: collapse consecutive duplicates.\n\nSo the overall pattern is, for each row in the input, collapse consecutive duplicates into a single element. Then, arrange the output as each processed row. But wait, in example 1, the input has three identical rows, each row is [3,4,6], which has no consecutive duplicates. So the output is each row as is. But in example 4, each row is like [4,4,4,4], which becomes [4], so the output has each row's consecutive duplicates collapsed.\n\nSo the rule is: For each individual row, process it by removing consecutive duplicates (keeping the first occurrence), then output each processed row in order. That seems to fit all examples.\n\nLet me verify with example 3:\n\nInput rows:\n\n[2,2] \u2192 [2]\n\n[6,6] \u2192 [6]\n\n[8,8] \u2192 [8]\n\n[8,8] \u2192 [8]\n\nOutput is:\n\n[2], [6], [8], [8]? Wait, but the example's output is [2], [6], [8]. But the input has four rows. The output in example 3 is three rows. Wait, example 3's input has four rows. Let me check again.\n\nWait, the input for example 3 is:\n\n[2,2]\n\n[6,6]\n\n[8,8]\n\n[8,8]\n\nOutput is:\n\n[2]\n\n[6]\n\n[8]\n\nWait, the output has three rows, but the input has four. So that contradicts the previous idea. Because if each row is processed individually, the input has four rows, so the output should have four rows. But in example 3's output, there are three rows. So that's a problem. So maybe there's another pattern here.\n\nWait, example 3's input is:\n\nRow 1: [2,2]\n\nRow 2: [6,6]\n\nRow 3: [8,8]\n\nRow 4: [8,8]\n\nThe output is:\n\n[2]\n\n[6]\n\n[8]\n\nSo, three rows. So how did that happen? Because the input has four rows. So processing each row individually would give four outputs, each being [2], [6], [8], [8]. But the output is three rows. So that's different. Therefore, my initial assumption about processing each row individually is incorrect.\n\nHmm, this complicates things. Let's re-examine the examples.\n\nIn example 3's input, there are four rows. But the output has three. So maybe adjacent rows that are the same after processing are merged into a single row.\n\nWait, let's see. The input rows after processing would be:\n\nRow 1: [2]\n\nRow 2: [6]\n\nRow 3: [8]\n\nRow 4: [8]\n\nSo rows 3 and 4 become the same. Then, maybe the output merges consecutive duplicate rows. So the pattern is: process each row to remove consecutive duplicates, then merge adjacent identical rows into one.\n\nSo for example, in example 3:\n\nAfter processing each row, you get four rows: [2], [6], [8], [8]. Then, since the third and fourth are the same, they are merged into a single [8]. So the output is three rows: [2], [6], [8].\n\nSimilarly, example 4's input has rows:\n\n[4,4,4,4] \u2192 [4]\n\n[4,4,4,4] \u2192 [4]\n\n[2,2,2,2] \u2192 [2]\n\n[2,2,2,2] \u2192 [2]\n\n[8,8,8,8] \u2192 [8]\n\n[3,3,3,3] \u2192 [3]\n\nSo after processing each row, you get six rows: [4], [4], [2], [2], [8], [3]. Then, merge consecutive duplicates. So the first two [4] become one [4], the next two [2] become one [2], and the rest are single, so the output is [4], [2], [8], [3], which matches example 4's output.\n\nSimilarly, example 0's input after processing each row:\n\n[1], [2], [1]. Since there are no consecutive duplicates in the processed rows (each row is different from the previous), the output is the same as the processed rows. So output is three rows: [1], [2], [1].\n\nIn example 1, after processing each row (three rows of [3,4,6] which becomes [3,4,6] each), then merging consecutive duplicates. Since all three rows are the same, they are merged into one. But the output is [3,4,6], which is the same as the input. Wait, but according to this merging step, three identical processed rows would become one. But in example 1's output, the output is a single row [3,4,6], which matches. So yes.\n\nSo the pattern seems to be two steps:\n\n1. For each individual row, collapse consecutive duplicates into a single occurrence. So a row becomes a list where consecutive duplicates are removed.\n\n2. Then, in the list of processed rows, merge consecutive duplicates into single rows. So if two or more consecutive rows are the same after processing, they become one.\n\nSo the steps are: process each row to remove consecutive duplicates, then collapse consecutive identical rows into one.\n\nLet me check example 2:\n\nInput is three rows of [2,3,3,8,1]. Processing each row gives [2,3,8,1] for each. Then, since all three rows are the same, they are merged into one. But in the output of example 2, it's [2,3,8,1], which is one row. But according to the training example 2's output, it's exactly that. Wait, the example's output is [2,3,8,1], but the original input had three rows. So the merged result is a single row. But the example's output shows that. So that fits.\n\nSo this two-step process explains all examples.\n\nNow, applying this to the test input:\n\nTest Input:\n\nFour rows of [1,1,2,3,3,3,8,8,4]\n\nProcessing each row:\n\nEach row is [1,1,2,3,3,3,8,8,4]. Let's remove consecutive duplicates.\n\n1. The first two 1s \u2192 1\n2. Then 2 (no duplicates)\n3. Three 3s \u2192 3\n4. Two 8s \u21928\n5. Then 4.\n\nSo processed row becomes [1,2,3,8,4].\n\nSince all four input rows are the same, after processing each becomes [1,2,3,8,4]. Then, merging consecutive duplicates (all four are same), so they collapse into one row: [1,2,3,8,4].\n\nWait, but according to the training examples, when all processed rows are the same, the output is one row. Like example 1, where three identical rows become one. So the test input's four processed rows would be merged into one. But wait, example 1's input has three rows that are the same, processed to the same, and the output is that single row. So yes.\n\nTherefore, the test input's output should be [1,2,3,8,4].\n\nWait, but let's double-check the training examples.\n\nIn example 1, three rows of [3,4,6] are processed to three rows of [3,4,6], which are merged into one row [3,4,6].\n\nIn example 2, three processed rows (all same) merged into one.\n\nIn example 3, two rows of [8] after processing are merged into one.\n\nIn example 4, two rows of [4], two of [2], then [8], [3] \u2192 merged into four rows: [4], [2], [8], [3].\n\nSo yes, merging consecutive duplicates. So if the test input's four processed rows are all [1,2,3,8,4], then merging them would result in a single row [1,2,3,8,4].\n\nBut looking at the training examples, when all the rows are the same after processing, the output is one instance. So the test case's output should be a single row [1,2,3,8,4].\n\nWait, but the test input has four rows. Let me check:\n\nOriginal Test Input:\n\n[1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 3, 8, 8, 4]\n\nRepeated four times.\n\nEach row processed becomes [1,2,3,8,4].\n\nSo after processing, four identical rows. Then, merging consecutive duplicates \u2192 becomes one row.\n\nSo the output should be [1,2,3,8,4].\n\nBut in the training examples, the output is structured as each line being a list, even if merged. For example, example 1's output is a single line. So the test output should be a single line.\n\nBut in the training examples, when rows are merged, the output lists are each on their own line, but when merged, they're combined into one line. So in example 3, the four rows became three lines because the last two merged. \n\nWait, let me re-examine the output formats.\n\nLooking at example 3's output:\n\n[2]\n\n[6]\n\n[8]\n\nWhich is three lines. The input was four lines, and after processing, the fourth line was merged with the third.\n\nSo for the test case, four lines processed into four [1,2,3,8,4], then merged into one line.\n\nSo the output should be a single line [1,2,3,8,4].\n\nBut let me check example 1 again. Input three identical rows, output is one row. So yes.\n\nTherefore, the test input's output is a single line [1,2,3,8,4]."
