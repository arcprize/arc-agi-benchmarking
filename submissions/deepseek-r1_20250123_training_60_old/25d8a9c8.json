        "cot_1": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. So, we have these input and output matrices. Each example has three rows, and the output seems to have rows of either [5,5,5] or [0,0,0]. Let's look at the examples one by one.\n\nStarting with Example 0:\nInput:\n[4,4,4]\n[2,3,2]\n[2,3,3]\n\nOutput:\n[5,5,5]\n[0,0,0]\n[0,0,0]\n\nHmm. The first row in the input is all 4s, and in the output, it's 5s. The other rows become zeros. Maybe there's something about the row being all the same number. Like, if a row has all elements equal, it gets converted to 5s, otherwise 0s. But wait, in Example 0, the first input row is [4,4,4], so all same. Output is 5s. Then the other rows aren't all the same, so they become zeros. Let's check other examples.\n\nExample 1:\nInput:\n[7,3,3]\n[6,6,6]\n[3,7,7]\n\nOutput:\n[0,0,0]\n[5,5,5]\n[0,0,0]\n\nHere, the second input row is all 6s, which becomes 5s. The first and third rows have different numbers, so they become zeros. So that seems to fit. So the rule might be: if a row in the input is all the same number, then in the output, that row becomes 5s. Otherwise, 0s. Let's check Example 2.\n\nExample 2:\nInput:\n[2,9,2]\n[4,4,4]\n[9,9,9]\n\nOutput:\n[0,0,0]\n[5,5,5]\n[5,5,5]\n\nThe second and third rows are all same numbers, so they become 5s. The first row isn't, so 0s. That fits.\n\nExample 3:\nInput:\n[2,2,4]\n[2,2,4]\n[1,1,1]\n\nOutput:\n[0,0,0]\n[0,0,0]\n[5,5,5]\n\nOnly the third row is all 1s, so it becomes 5s. The others aren't, so 0s. So this seems consistent.\n\nWait, but in Example 0's input, the third row is [2,3,3]. The first element is 2, others are 3. So that's not all the same. So output 0s. Correct.\n\nSo the pattern is: for each row in the input matrix, if all elements in the row are the same, replace that row with [5,5,5]. Otherwise, replace with [0,0,0].\n\nNow let's apply this to the Test Input:\n\nTest Input:\n[4,4,4] \u2192 all same \u2192 5s\n[3,2,3] \u2192 not all same (elements are 3,2,3) \u2192 0s\n[8,8,8] \u2192 all same \u21925s\n\nSo the output should be:\n\n[5,5,5]\n[0,0,0]\n[5,5,5]\n\nWait, but looking at the training examples, let's check if there's any other condition. For example, maybe the 5s are only applied if the number is even? Let's check. Example 0: 4 is even, becomes 5. Example1: 6 is even, becomes 5. Example2: 4 and 9. 4 is even, 9 is odd. Both become 5. So no, the parity of the number doesn't matter. The only condition is whether all elements in the row are the same. Then, regardless of the number, the row becomes 5s. So the Test Input's first and third rows should be 5s, and the second row 0s.\n\nSo the correct output should be:\n\n[5,5,5]\n[0,0,0]\n[5,5,5]\n\nWait, but looking at the training examples again. Let me confirm. For example, in Example2, the third row is [9,9,9] which is all 9s. Output is 5s. So regardless of the original number, as long as all elements are same, output is 5s. Yes. So the test input's first and third rows are all same, so they become 5s. The second row is [3,2,3], not all same. So output 0s. So the final output should be:\n\n[5,5,5]\n\n[0,0,0]\n\n[5,5,5]\n\nWhich matches the pattern.",

        "cot_2": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. We have these input and output matrices. Let me look at the training examples one by one to see what's going on.\n\nStarting with Example 0:\nInput:\n[4,4,4]\n[2,3,2]\n[2,3,3]\nOutput:\n[5,5,5]\n[0,0,0]\n[0,0,0]\nHmm. The output has the first row as all 5s and the rest as 0s. Let me check the input rows. The first row in input is all 4s. The other rows have some variation. Maybe the rows that are all the same number in the input get transformed into 5s in the output? But wait, in Example 0's input, the first row is [4,4,4], which becomes [5,5,5]. The other rows aren't all the same. So that seems possible.\n\nExample 1:\nInput:\n[7,3,3]\n[6,6,6]\n[3,7,7]\nOutput:\n[0,0,0]\n[5,5,5]\n[0,0,0]\nHere, the second input row is all 6s, and the output's second row is all 5s. The other rows in input aren't all the same. So again, the rows that are all the same number in input become 5s in output, and others become 0s. But wait, the third row in input is [3,7,7] which isn't all the same. So yes, only the row with all same elements becomes 5s.\n\nExample 2:\nInput:\n[2,9,2]\n[4,4,4]\n[9,9,9]\nOutput:\n[0,0,0]\n[5,5,5]\n[5,5,5]\nSo here, the second and third input rows are all same (4s and 9s). Both of them become 5s. The first row isn't all same, so 0s. That fits the pattern.\n\nExample3:\nInput:\n[2,2,4]\n[2,2,4]\n[1,1,1]\nOutput:\n[0,0,0]\n[0,0,0]\n[5,5,5]\nOnly the third row in input is all 1s, so it becomes 5s. The first two rows aren't uniform, so 0s. So the pattern seems to be: for each row in the input matrix, if all elements in the row are the same, replace them with 5. Otherwise, replace with 0. \n\nBut wait, let's check if there's any other condition. For instance, maybe the original number affects whether it's 5 or 0. Let's see. In Example0, the row of 4s becomes 5s. Example1: row of 6s becomes 5s. Example2: rows of 4 and 9 become 5s. Example3: row of 1s becomes 5s. So regardless of the original number, if all elements are same, change to 5. Otherwise 0. So the transformation is: for each row, check if all elements are equal. If yes, output 5s. Else, 0s.\n\nNow, let's test this with the Test Input:\nTest Input:\n[4,4,4] -> all same, so 5s\n[3,2,3] -> not all same, 0s\n[8,8,8] -> all same, 5s\n\nSo the output should be:\n[5,5,5]\n[0,0,0]\n[5,5,5]\n\nWait, but looking back at the examples, in Example0, the first row was 4s and turned into 5s. Similarly, in the Test Input, the first and third rows are all same. So their output rows would be 5s, the middle row would be 0s. So the output should be:\n\n[5,5,5]\n[0,0,0]\n[5,5,5]\n\nBut let me check if there's any exception. For example, maybe the rows are ordered in a different way? Like maybe the position in the matrix affects it. But all the examples seem to process each row independently. So the answer should follow that pattern."
