        "cot_1": "Okay, let's tackle this puzzle. I need to figure out the pattern that transforms the input matrices into the output ones. Let's look at the training examples closely.\n\nStarting with Example 0:\n\nInput:\n[0, 0, 5]\n[0, 5, 0]\n[5, 0, 0]\n\nOutput:\n[3, 3, 3]\n[4, 4, 4]\n[2, 2, 2]\n\nHmm, each row in the output is all the same number. So maybe the position of the 5 in each row determines the output number. Let's check:\n\nIn the first input row, the 5 is in the third position (index 2). The output is 3.\nSecond row has 5 in the second position (index 1). Output is 4.\nThird row has 5 in the first position (index 0). Output is 2.\n\nWait, maybe the index of 5 plus 1? Let's see:\n\nIndex 2 \u2192 3 (2+1=3), yes. Index 1 \u2192 4? That doesn't fit. 1+1=2. Hmm, no. So maybe something else.\n\nLooking at the outputs for each row: 3,4,2. How do these numbers relate to the positions of the 5s?\n\nIn Example 0, the 5s are in positions 2, 1, 0 (0-based). The outputs per row are 3,4,2. Wait, 2 \u21923, 1\u21924, 0\u21922. Not obvious.\n\nLooking at Example 1:\n\nInput has all 5s in the third position (index 2). All output rows are 3. So 3 here. So 2+1=3. That fits. So maybe the column index (0-based) plus 1 gives the output number. So if 5 is in column 2 (third column), output is 3. But in Example 0, the second row has 5 in column 1 (second column), output is 4. Wait, 1+1=2, but output is 4. That doesn't add up. So maybe there's another pattern.\n\nWait, perhaps the output numbers are related to the number of times a particular column has the 5 in the entire matrix. Let's check:\n\nExample 0 input has three rows with 5 in columns 2,1,0. So each column has exactly one 5. But the outputs are 3,4,2. That doesn't seem to align.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the sum of the elements in each row. But input rows sum to 5 each. Output rows sum to 9, 12, 6. Not sure.\n\nAnother angle: the output numbers might correspond to the positions of the 5s in a different way. Let's list all examples:\n\nExample 0:\n\nRow 0: 5 in column 2 \u2192 output 3\nRow 1: 5 in column 1 \u2192 output 4\nRow 2: 5 in column 0 \u2192 output 2\n\nExample1: All 5s in column 2 \u2192 output 3 for all rows.\n\nExample2:\n\nRow0: 5 in col0 \u2192 output2\nRow1: 5 in col1 \u2192 output4\nRow2:5 in col0 \u2192 output2\n\nOutputs are 2,4,2.\n\nExample3:\n\nRow0:5 in col1 \u2192 output4\nRow1:5 in col2 \u2192 output3\nRow2:5 in col1 \u2192 output4\n\nHmm. Let's see if there's a mapping from the column of 5 to the output number:\n\nLooking at column indexes (0,1,2) and possible outputs (2,3,4):\n\nIn Example0:\n\ncol2 \u21923\n\ncol1 \u21924\n\ncol0\u21922\n\nExample1:\n\ncol2 \u21923\n\nExample2:\n\ncol0\u21922\n\ncol1\u21924\n\ncol0\u21922\n\nExample3:\n\ncol1\u21924\n\ncol2\u21923\n\ncol1\u21924\n\nSo the mapping seems:\n\ncol0 \u21922\n\ncol1 \u21924\n\ncol2 \u21923\n\nWait, that's possible. Let's check:\n\nIn Example0, row0 (col2) \u21923, row1 (col1)\u21924, row2 (col0)\u21922. Yes.\n\nExample2: row0 (col0\u21922), row1 (col1\u21924), row2 (col0\u21922). Correct.\n\nExample3: row0 (col1\u21924), row1 (col2\u21923), row2 (col1\u21924). Correct.\n\nSo the pattern is: For each row in the input, look at which column the 5 is in. Then, replace that row in the output with all the number that corresponds to that column. The mapping from column index to output number is:\n\ncolumn 0 \u2192 2\n\ncolumn 1 \u21924\n\ncolumn 2 \u21923\n\nSo the key is to figure out that the columns 0,1,2 map to 2,4,3 respectively.\n\nNow, applying this to the test input:\n\nTest Input:\n[0,0,5] \u2192 5 in column2 \u21923\n[5,0,0] \u21925 in column0 \u21922\n[0,5,0] \u21925 in column1 \u21924\n\nSo the output should be:\n\n[3,3,3]\n\n[2,2,2]\n\n[4,4,4]\n\nEach row is filled with the corresponding number based on the column of the 5.\n\nSo the answer should be:\n\n[3,3,3]\n\n[2,2,2]\n\n[4,4,4]\n\nLet me check if this fits with the examples. Yes, the mapping is column 0\u21922,1\u21924,2\u21923. So the test input's rows are column2, column0, column1, leading to 3,2,4. So the output rows each have those numbers repeated. That makes sense.",

        "cot_2": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. So we have these input matrices with 0s and 5s, and the outputs are matrices filled with numbers like 2,3,4, but all the same in each row. Let me look at the examples one by one.\n\nStarting with Example 0:\n\nInput:\n[0, 0, 5]\n[0, 5, 0]\n[5, 0, 0]\n\nOutput:\n[3,3,3]\n[4,4,4]\n[2,2,2]\n\nHmm, each row in the output is the same number. Let's see the positions of the 5s in the input. The first row has a 5 in the third column. The second row has a 5 in the second column. The third row has a 5 in the first column. Then the output rows are 3,4,2. Maybe the column index of the 5 plus something? Let's see, column indexes are 0-based? Like third column is index 2. But 2+1=3, which matches the first output row. Second row 5 is at index 1, 1+3=4? Wait, that doesn't fit. Or maybe it's the row number plus column index? Let's think again.\n\nWait, maybe each row's 5 position corresponds to a value. For example, in row 0 (first row), the 5 is in position 2 (third column), output is 3. Row 1 (second row), 5 is in position 1 (second column), output 4. Row 2 (third row), 5 is in position 0 (first column), output 2. So maybe the output is (row index + column index of 5 + 1) mod something? Let's check:\n\nRow 0: 0 (row index) + 2 (5's position) = 2. Output is 3. So 2+1=3. Hmm. Row 1: row index 1 + 1 (5's position) =2. Output is 4. Wait, 2+2=4. Row 2: 2 + 0=2. Output is 2. That doesn't fit. Maybe it's not straightforward.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output number is determined by the position of the 5 in the row. For example, if the 5 is in column 0 (first position), the output is 2. If in column 1, output is 4. If in column 2, output is 3. Let's check:\n\nExample 0: first row 5 in column 2 \u2192 3. Second row 5 in column 1 \u21924. Third row 5 in column 0 \u21922. That fits. Example 1 has all 5s in column 2, so all outputs are 3. Example 2's input rows have 5s in columns 0,1,0. So outputs are 2,4,2. Which matches the given output. Example 3: 5s in column 1,2,1. Outputs are 4,3,4. So the mapping seems to be:\n\nIf the 5 in a row is in column 0 \u2192 output is 2\n\nColumn 1 \u21924\n\nColumn 2 \u21923\n\nSo the pattern is the position of the 5 in the row maps to a specific number: 0\u21922, 1\u21924, 2\u21923.\n\nNow, the test input is:\n\n[0,0,5] \u21925 in column 2 \u21923\n\n[5,0,0] \u21925 in column 0 \u21922\n\n[0,5,0] \u21925 in column 1 \u21924\n\nSo each row's output should be [3,3,3], [2,2,2], [4,4,4]. Let's check if this fits with the examples. Yes, like in example 0, the first row [0,0,5] maps to 3, so the output is all 3s. Similarly for others. So the answer should be:\n\n[3,3,3]\n\n[2,2,2]\n\n[4,4,4]"
