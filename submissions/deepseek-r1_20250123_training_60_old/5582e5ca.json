Let me look at the examples.\n\nStarting with Example 0:\nInput:\n[4,4,8]\n[6,4,3]\n[6,3,0]\n\nOutput is all 4s. Hmm. Let me check the input numbers. The numbers in the input are 4,4,8; 6,4,3; 6,3,0. Wait, maybe the output is the mode of some numbers? Because 4 appears multiple times. Let's count. The numbers are: 4 appears 4 times (positions (0,0), (0,1), (1,1), (2,0)), 6 appears 3 times, 8 once, 3 twice, etc. So mode is 4, so output is 4s.\n\nExample 1:\nInput:\n[6,8,9]\n[1,8,1]\n[9,4,9]\n\nOutput is all 9s. Let's count the numbers. 6 once, 8 twice, 9 three times, 1 twice, 4 once. So the mode here is 9. So output is 9s. That fits.\n\nExample 2:\nInput:\n[4,6,9]\n[6,4,1]\n[8,8,6]\n\nOutput is 6s. Let's count. 4 appears twice, 6 appears three times (positions (0,1), (1,0), (2,2)), 8 twice, others once. So mode is 6. So output is 6s. So the pattern seems to be taking the mode of all numbers in the input grid and filling the output grid with that mode value.\n\nSo for the test input:\nInput:\n[8,8,6]\n[4,6,9]\n[8,3,0]\n\nLet's list all numbers: 8,8,6,4,6,9,8,3,0. Now count them. 8 appears 3 times (positions (0,0), (0,1), (2,0)), 6 appears twice (0,2 and 1,1), 4 once, 9 once, 3 once, 0 once. So mode is 8. So the output should be all 8s.",

So, looking at the training examples. \n\nIn Example 0, the input arrays are:\n\n[4,4,8]\n[6,4,3]\n[6,3,0]\n\nAnd the output is all 4s in a 3x3 grid. Hmm. Let's check the numbers. The input numbers are 4,4,8; 6,4,3; 6,3,0. Maybe the output is the mode? Let's see. The numbers here include four 4s, two 6s, an 8, a 3, and 0. Wait, the mode is 4 here, which matches the output. \n\nExample 1's input is:\n\n[6,8,9]\n[1,8,1]\n[9,4,9]\n\nThe output is all 9s. Let's count the numbers. There are three 9s, two 8s, two 1s, a 6, and a 4. The mode here is 9, which again matches the output. \n\nExample 2's input:\n\n[4,6,9]\n[6,4,1]\n[8,8,6]\n\nThe output is all 6s. Let's count. The numbers: 4 appears twice, 6 appears three times, 9 once, 1 once, 8 twice. So mode is 6. Yep, that fits. \n\nSo the pattern seems to be taking the mode (most frequent number) from all the elements in the input arrays and then creating a grid where every element is that mode. \n\nNow, let's check the test input:\n\n[8,8,6]\n[4,6,9]\n[8,3,0]\n\nLet's list all the numbers: 8,8,6,4,6,9,8,3,0. \n\nCounting frequencies:\n8 appears three times,\n6 appears two times,\n4 once,\n9 once,\n3 once,\n0 once.\n\nSo the mode is 8. Therefore, the output should be a 3x3 grid filled with 8s. \n\nWait, but wait. Let me double-check the counts. \n\nFirst row: 8,8,6 \u2192 two 8s and one 6. Second row:4,6,9 \u2192 one each of 4,6,9. Third row:8,3,0 \u2192 one 8, one 3, one 0. \n\nTotal 8s: 2 (from first row) + 1 (third row) = 3. \n\n6s: 1 (first) + 1 (second) = 2. \n\nSo yes, 8 is the mode. So the output should be all 8s."
