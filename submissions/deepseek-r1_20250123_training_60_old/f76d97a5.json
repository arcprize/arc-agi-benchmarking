        "cot_1": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. So, looking at the training examples, each input is a 2D array, and the output is another 2D array with some elements turned to zero and others kept as numbers. Let's start with Example 0.\n\nIn Example 0, the input is a 3x3 grid. The output has zeros on the edges except the middle row and column. Wait, the input has 4s and 5s. The output has 0s where the original numbers were 4 or 5, but maybe only the 5s are kept? Let me check. The first row of input is [4,5,4], output is [0,4,0]. Hmm, so the middle element is 4. Original middle was 5. Wait, that doesn't make sense. Wait, maybe the output is the value of the neighboring elements. Or perhaps it's about the minimal or maximal in some way.\n\nWait, let's look at Example 0's input:\n\nOriginal:\nRow 0: [4,5,4]\nRow 1: [5,5,5]\nRow 2: [4,5,4]\n\nOutput:\nRow 0: [0,4,0]\nRow 1: [4,4,4]\nRow 2: [0,4,0]\n\nHmm. So the output entries are 4 when the original was 5, and 0 when original was 4? Wait no. Wait, input has 5 in the center of row 0, and output has 4 there. Wait, the output 4 is different from the input 5. So that doesn't fit. Alternatively, maybe the output is the minimum of adjacent cells?\n\nWait maybe it's checking if a cell is the same as its neighbors. For example, in the output, a cell is 0 unless it's part of a line of the same numbers. Let's see.\n\nIn Example 0's input, the middle row is all 5s, which in the output becomes 4s. The middle element of the first row is 5, but in output it's 4. So that might not be it. Alternatively, perhaps the output is the number that appears the most in the input. For Example 0, the input has more 5s than 4s. Wait, input has 4 5s and 5 4s? Let's count:\n\nFirst row: 4,5,4 \u2192 two 4s, one 5.\nSecond row: three 5s.\nThird row: two 4s, one 5.\nSo total 4s: 2 + 0 + 2 = 4. 5s: 1 +3 +1=5. So 5 is more common. But the output uses 4 and 0. Hmm, that doesn't align.\n\nAnother approach: Maybe the output is the number that's the minimum (or maximum) in the input. For Example 0, input numbers are 4 and 5. The minimum is 4. The output uses 4 and 0. Maybe for each cell, if it's surrounded by the same number, it becomes 0, else the min. Or perhaps if the cell is part of a certain structure.\n\nLooking at Example 1's input:\n\nInput is a 5x5 grid. The output has 6s and 0s. Let's check the input values. The input has 5,6. Output uses 6 and 0. So perhaps the output uses the maximum value from the input. For example, in Example 0, the max is 5, but the output is 4. Wait, that doesn't fit. So maybe not max.\n\nWait in Example 1's input, let's see:\n\nThe input array has elements 5,5,6,6,6 in the first row. The output's first row is [6,6,0,0,0]. So maybe the transformation is replacing certain elements with 0 and others with the maximum value. Let's see. The max in input for Example 1 is 6, so output uses 6. For Example 0, the max is 5, but output uses 4, so that doesn't fit. So maybe that's not it.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the value of the cell if it's part of a diagonal or some pattern, otherwise zero. Let's look at the outputs.\n\nIn Example 0's output, the middle row is all 4s. The middle column is 4s except the middle row. Wait, maybe it's a cross? The output for Example 0 is a cross of 4s with the rest as 0. But the input's middle row and column are 5s. So why 4? Maybe 4 is the other number present in the input. So the cross is formed by the other number.\n\nWait, the input has two numbers: 4 and 5. The output has 4s where the input has 5s, and 0 where the input has 4s. Wait, in Example 0's input, the middle row is all 5s, which in the output becomes 4s. So perhaps, the output is the other number in the input. If the input has two distinct numbers, then the output uses the other number for certain cells and zero for others.\n\nWait, for Example 0, input has 4 and 5. So the output uses 4 (the other number) in certain positions. The output's 4s form a cross. So perhaps, whenever a cell in the input is part of a cross (like a plus sign) of the majority number, then it's replaced by the other number. Otherwise, set to zero.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by looking at each cell and checking if it's part of a horizontal or vertical line of at least three identical numbers. If not, set to zero, else replace with the other number. Let's see.\n\nIn Example 0's input, the middle row is three 5s. The middle column is three 5s (rows 0,1,2 in the middle). So those would form a cross. The output has 4s in those positions, which is the other number, and zeros elsewhere. So maybe the pattern is: for each cell that is part of a horizontal or vertical line of three or more of the same number (the majority), replace that cell with the other number. But how does that lead to the output structure?\n\nWait, in Example 0's input, the majority number is 5 (appears 5 times, 4 appears 4 times). So perhaps the cross (middle row and column) of 5s is replaced with 4, the other number, and the 4s in the input are replaced with 0. So the output is: for cells that are 5 in the input and part of the cross, they become 4; all other 5s and 4s become 0. But in Example 0's output, the middle row (all 5s) becomes 4s. The middle column (5s in rows 0,1,2) also becomes 4s, forming a cross. The rest are 0. So maybe the transformation is: identify the majority number (5 in Example 0), then for each cell in the input that is part of the vertical or horizontal line (cross) of that majority number, replace it with the minority number (4), and set all other cells to 0.\n\nLet's check Example 1. The input has 5 and 6. Let's count the numbers. Each row in Example 1's input:\n\nRow 0: 5,5,6,6,6 \u2192 two 5s, three 6s.\nRow 1: 6,5,5,6,6 \u2192 two 5s, three 6s.\nRow 2: 6,6,5,5,6 \u2192 two 5s, three 6s.\nRow 3: 6,6,6,5,5 \u2192 two 5s, three 6s.\nRow 4: 5,6,6,6,5 \u2192 two 5s, three 6s.\n\nSo total 5s: 2*5=10, 6s: 3*5=15. So majority is 6. The output uses 6 and 0. So the cross would be the vertical and horizontal lines where 6 is in majority. Wait, but in Example 1's output, the 6s form a diagonal-like pattern. Let me see the output for Example 1:\n\nOutput rows:\n\n[6,6,0,0,0]\n[0,6,6,0,0]\n[0,0,6,6,0]\n[0,0,0,6,6]\n[6,0,0,0,6]\n\nThis looks like a diagonal where each row has two 6s, shifting right each row, and the last row wraps around. So maybe it's a different pattern. Hmm, this doesn't fit the cross idea.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's a spiral or another pattern. Alternatively, maybe the output is the cells that are part of a certain structure. For example, in Example 1's output, the 6s form a diagonal pattern that shifts. Let's count the positions:\n\nRow 0: positions 0 and 1 are 6, others 0.\nRow 1: positions 1 and 2 are 6.\nRow 2: positions 2 and 3 are 6.\nRow 3: positions 3 and 4 are 6.\nRow 4: positions 4 and 0 are 6.\n\nSo it's a diagonal pattern that shifts right each row, and wraps around. That's a kind of ring pattern. But how does that relate to the input?\n\nLooking at Example 1's input. The majority is 6. The output uses 6s in a pattern that might be the positions where in the input, the 6s form a certain structure. But looking at the input rows:\n\nRow 0: 5,5,6,6,6. The output row 0 is 6,6,0,0,0. So the first two elements in input are 5,5, but output here is 6,6. That doesn't make sense if it's based on the input's 6 positions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's based on transitions between the two numbers. Alternatively, the output is the positions where the cell is the same as the majority and has neighbors in a certain way.\n\nWait, perhaps the output is the majority number where the cell is part of a \"band\" around the grid. For Example 1, the output forms a band that moves right each row, creating a diagonal pattern. But how is this derived from the input?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is determined by the parity of the position. For example, even rows or columns. But looking at Example 0's output, it's a cross, which doesn't fit parity.\n\nAnother approach: Let's look for how each element in the output is determined based on its neighbors in the input.\n\nIn Example 0's input, the middle cell (1,1) is 5, and in output it's 4. The surrounding cells are 5s. Wait, maybe the output is the minimum value of the cell and its adjacent neighbors. Let's see:\n\nFor the middle cell (1,1) in Example 0, the neighbors are 5s. So min(5,5,5,5,5) is 5, but output is 4. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is the difference between the cell and its neighbors. But that's getting complicated.\n\nLet's try to find a pattern that can explain all examples.\n\nIn Example 2's input:\n\nInput numbers are 9,5. The output uses 9 and 0. Let's check the majority. The input rows are:\n\nRow 0: 9,5,9,9,9 \u2192 4 nines, 1 five.\nRow 1: 9,9,5,5,9 \u2192 3 nines, 2 fives.\nRow 2: 9,5,9,9,9 \u2192 same as row 0.\nRow 3:9,9,5,9,9 \u2192 4 nines, 1 five.\nRow 4:9,9,9,5,5 \u2192 3 nines, 2 fives.\n\nTotal nines: (4+3+4+4+3) = 18, fives: (1+2+1+1+2) =7. So majority is 9. The output uses 9 and 0.\n\nLooking at the output of Example 2:\n\n[0,9,0,0,0]\n[0,0,9,9,0]\n[0,9,0,0,0]\n[0,0,9,0,0]\n[0,0,0,9,9]\n\nSo in row 0, the second element is 9. In row 1, elements 2 and 3 are 9. Row 2 has the second element as 9. Row 3's third element is 9. Row 4 has elements 3 and 4 as 9. This seems like a different pattern. For example, in row 1, two consecutive 9s. Maybe it's checking for where the cell in the input has a certain number of the majority and minority numbers around it.\n\nAlternatively, looking for the positions where the input has the minority number (5 in this case), and the output uses the majority (9) in those positions. But in Example 2's input, where are the 5s?\n\nIn Example 2's input, 5s are at positions:\n\nRow 0: index 1.\n\nRow 1: indices 2 and 3.\n\nRow 2: index 1.\n\nRow 3: index 2.\n\nRow 4: indices 3 and 4.\n\nNow, looking at the output for Example 2:\n\nThe 9s in the output are at positions where the input had 5s. Because:\n\nOutput row 0: [0,9,0,0,0] \u2192 input's row 0 had 5 at index 1. So the output has 9 here.\n\nRow 1: [0,0,9,9,0] \u2192 input's row 1 had 5s at 2 and 3. Output has 9s there.\n\nRow 2: [0,9,0,0,0] \u2192 input's row 2 had 5 at index 1. Output has 9 here.\n\nRow 3: [0,0,9,0,0] \u2192 input's row 3 had 5 at index 2. Output has 9 here.\n\nRow 4: [0,0,0,9,9] \u2192 input's row 4 had 5s at 3 and 4. Output has 9s there.\n\nSo the pattern here is: wherever the input has the minority number (5 in Example 2), the output replaces it with the majority number (9), and sets all other positions (where the input had majority numbers) to 0.\n\nWait, but looking at Example 0's input:\n\nInput has numbers 4 and 5. The majority is 5 (5 occurrences) vs 4 (4 occurrences). The output for Example 0 has 4s in positions where the input had 5s (the majority?), but that contradicts. Because in Example 0's input, the majority is 5, but the output replaces 5s with 4s. Wait, maybe it's the opposite: the output replaces the majority number with the minority number, and minority positions become zero? Wait, in Example 0's output, the 4s are in positions where the input had 5s. Because the majority is 5, so replacing them with minority (4). And the original 4s in the input become 0. So the pattern is: for each cell in the input, if the cell's value is the majority number, replace it with the minority number. Otherwise, set it to 0.\n\nLet me check that.\n\nExample 0: majority is 5 (5 times), minority 4 (4 times). So in input, wherever there's a 5 (majority), output is 4 (minority). Input 4s become 0. Let's check:\n\nOriginal input for Example 0:\n\nRow 0: [4,5,4] \u2192 5 is majority. So in output, replace 5 with 4. 4s become 0. So output is [0,4,0]. Which matches.\n\nRow 1: [5,5,5] \u2192 all majority. Replace each 5 with 4. So output is [4,4,4]. Which matches.\n\nRow 2: same as row 0. Output matches.\n\nSo this seems to fit.\n\nExample 1: input has majority 6 (15 occurrences), minority 5 (10). So in input, wherever 6 is present (majority), replace with minority (5) and wherever 5 is present, replace with 0. But the output for Example 1 has 6s. Wait, that contradicts. So maybe this pattern is not correct.\n\nWait no. Wait, Example 1's output is:\n\n[6,6,0,0,0]\n[0,6,6,0,0]\n[0,0,6,6,0]\n[0,0,0,6,6]\n[6,0,0,0,6]\n\nBut according to the previous pattern, the majority is 6, so in input, wherever there is a 6, replace it with minority 5. But the output has 6s. That's a problem. So that can't be the pattern.\n\nHmm, so maybe my initial hypothesis is wrong. Let's think again.\n\nLooking at Example 1's output, the numbers are 6 and 0. The input's numbers are 5 and 6. So the output uses the majority (6) and 0. So perhaps the pattern is: wherever the input has the minority number (5), replace it with the majority number (6), and wherever the input has the majority number, replace it with 0. But let's check.\n\nIn Example 1's input, the minority is 5, majority is 6. So, in the input, cells with 5 would become 6, and cells with 6 become 0.\n\nLooking at Example 1's output rows:\n\nRow 0 input: [5,5,6,6,6] \u2192 minority 5s at positions 0 and 1. So output would be [6,6,0,0,0], which matches.\n\nRow 1 input: [6,5,5,6,6] \u2192 5s at positions 1 and 2 \u2192 output [0,6,6,0,0], which matches.\n\nRow 2 input: [6,6,5,5,6] \u2192 5s at 2 and 3 \u2192 output [0,0,6,6,0], which matches.\n\nRow 3 input: [6,6,6,5,5] \u2192 5s at 3 and 4 \u2192 output [0,0,0,6,6], which matches.\n\nRow 4 input: [5,6,6,6,5] \u2192 5s at 0 and 4 \u2192 output [6,0,0,0,6], which matches.\n\nYes! So this fits. So the pattern is: for each cell in the input, if the cell's value is the minority number in the entire input grid, replace it with the majority number. If the cell's value is the majority number, replace it with 0. So the output matrix has 0s where the majority was, and the majority's value where the minority was.\n\nLet's check other examples.\n\nExample 0: Majority is 5 (5 occurrences), minority 4 (4). So replace minority (4) in input with majority (5), and majority (5) with 0. Wait, but the output of Example 0 has 4s where the input had 5s. Wait, no. According to this pattern:\n\nIn Example 0's input, cells with 4 (minority) would be replaced with 5 (majority), and cells with 5 (majority) become 0. But the output of Example 0 has 4s. So this contradicts.\n\nWait, this is a problem. So maybe the pattern is the reverse: cells with majority become the minority, and minority cells become 0.\n\nLet me re-examine.\n\nIn Example 0:\n\nInput numbers: 4 and 5. Majority is 5 (appears 5 times), minority 4 (4 times).\n\nIf the pattern is:\n\n- If cell is majority (5), replace with minority (4).\n\n- If cell is minority (4), replace with 0.\n\nThen the output would be:\n\nOriginal input:\n\nRow0: 4,5,4 \u2192 4 \u21920; 5\u21924; 4\u21920 \u2192 [0,4,0]\n\nRow1:5,5,5 \u2192 all 5 \u2192 [4,4,4]\n\nRow2:4,5,4 \u2192 same as row0.\n\nWhich matches the output of Example 0.\n\nIn Example 1:\n\nMajority is 6, minority 5.\n\nSo for each cell:\n\n- If cell is 6 (majority), replace with 0.\n\n- If cell is 5 (minority), replace with 6.\n\nWhich matches the output of Example 1.\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput numbers are 9 and 5. Majority is 9, minority 5.\n\nSo replace each 9 (majority) with 0, and each 5 (minority) with 9. Let's check:\n\nExample 2's output:\n\nRow0 input: [9,5,9,9,9] \u2192 5 is minority. So output should be 9 in position 1, others 0. Which matches [0,9,0,0,0].\n\nRow1 input: [9,9,5,5,9] \u2192 5s at 2 and3 \u2192 output 9,9,0 \u2192 [0,0,9,9,0]. Which matches.\n\nRow2 input: [9,5,9,9,9] \u2192 5 at 1 \u2192 [0,9,0,0,0]. Correct.\n\nRow3 input: [9,9,5,9,9] \u2192 5 at 2 \u2192 output [0,0,9,0,0]. Correct.\n\nRow4 input: [9,9,9,5,5] \u2192 5s at 3 and4 \u2192 output [0,0,0,9,9]. Correct.\n\nYes, this fits.\n\nSo the pattern is:\n\n1. Determine the majority number in the entire input grid. The majority is the number that appears more frequently. If there's a tie, perhaps pick the larger one, but in the examples given, there's no tie.\n\n2. For each cell in the input:\n\n   a. If the cell's value is the majority number, replace it with 0.\n\n   b. If the cell's value is the minority number (the other number), replace it with the majority number.\n\nSo the transformation is: replace minority numbers with the majority, and majority numbers with 0.\n\nNow, applying this to the Test Input.\n\nTest Input:\n\n[3,3,3,5,3]\n\n[3,5,3,3,3]\n\n[3,5,5,3,5]\n\n[3,3,3,5,3]\n\n[5,5,5,3,3]\n\nFirst, determine the majority number.\n\nCount the occurrences of each number.\n\nLet's count all elements:\n\nRow0: 3,3,3,5,3 \u2192 4 3s, 1 5.\n\nRow1:3,5,3,3,3 \u2192 4 3s, 1 5.\n\nRow2:3,5,5,3,5 \u2192 2 3s, 3 5s.\n\nRow3:3,3,3,5,3 \u2192 4 3s, 1 5.\n\nRow4:5,5,5,3,3 \u2192 3 5s, 2 3s.\n\nTotal 3s: 4+4+2+4+2=16.\n\nTotal 5s: 1+1+3+1+3=9.\n\nSo majority is 3 (appears 16 times), minority is 5 (9 times).\n\nSo according to the pattern:\n\n- All cells with 3 (majority) become 0.\n\n- All cells with 5 (minority) become 3.\n\nSo let's process each row.\n\nTest Input rows:\n\nRow0: [3,3,3,5,3] \u2192 convert 3s to 0, 5 to 3 \u2192 [0,0,0,3,0]\n\nRow1: [3,5,3,3,3] \u2192 [0,3,0,0,0]\n\nRow2: [3,5,5,3,5] \u2192 [0,3,3,0,3]\n\nRow3: [3,3,3,5,3] \u2192 [0,0,0,3,0]\n\nRow4: [5,5,5,3,3] \u2192 [3,3,3,0,0]\n\nSo the output should be:\n\n[0,0,0,3,0]\n\n[0,3,0,0,0]\n\n[0,3,3,0,3]\n\n[0,0,0,3,0]\n\n[3,3,3,0,0]\n\nWait, but let's check the training examples. For instance, Example 1's output has the minority positions (5s in input) replaced with majority (6), and majority positions (6 in input) become 0. Similarly here, the minority is 5, which should be replaced with 3, and majority 3 becomes 0.\n\nYes. So the test input's output would be as above.",

Let's start with Example 0.\n\nExample 0 Input:\n[4,5,4]\n[5,5,5]\n[4,5,4]\n\nOutput:\n[0,4,0]\n[4,4,4]\n[0,4,0]\n\nHmm, so the output seems to have 0s and 4s. The middle of each row in the input is 5, but in the output, it's 4. Wait, maybe the output is using the value that's surrounding the center? Like, the input is a 3x3 grid. The center is 5, but the surrounding elements are 4. So the output replaces the center with 4 and the surrounding with 0? Wait, not exactly. Let me check.\n\nWait, in the first row of input: 4,5,4 \u2192 output is 0,4,0. So the middle element (5) becomes 4, and the others become 0. The same pattern applies to the third row. The middle row in input is all 5s, and the output is all 4s. So maybe the transformation is replacing each element with the minimum value of the adjacent cells (or some other operation on the neighbors)? Or perhaps the output is determined by the value that is most common around the current position, except for the current value.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's looking for cells that are part of a \"border\". For example, in a 3x3 grid, the center is 5, and the surrounding are 4. So perhaps the output is replacing each 5 (the center value) with 4 (the surrounding value), and the 4s become 0. But that might not explain other examples.\n\nLet's look at Example 1. The input is a 5x5 grid. The output has 6s and 0s. Let's see:\n\nInput rows for Example 1:\n\nFirst row: [5,5,6,6,6]\nOutput row: [6,6,0,0,0]\n\nWait, the output starts with two 6s, then three 0s. Maybe the pattern here is that each cell is replaced by the value of the cell to its left, but that might not hold. Let me check other rows.\n\nSecond input row: [6,5,5,6,6] \u2192 Output: [0,6,6,0,0]. Hmm. The third input row: [6,6,5,5,6] \u2192 Output [0,0,6,6,0]. Fourth input row: [6,6,6,5,5] \u2192 [0,0,0,6,6]. Fifth input row: [5,6,6,6,5] \u2192 [6,0,0,0,6].\n\nLooking at the fifth row's output: input starts and ends with 5, but output starts and ends with 6. So maybe when the cell is a 5, it's replaced by the value of the next cell? Or perhaps the output is shifting values in some way.\n\nWait, another approach: maybe the output is created by taking each cell and checking if it's the same as the majority of its neighbors. If not, replace it with the majority value, otherwise 0. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is highlighting the cells where the value is different from the next one in a certain direction, like a shift. For example, in Example 1's first output row [6,6,0,0,0], perhaps the first two 5s in the input become 6s. The input starts with 5,5,6,6,6. So the output's first two are 6, which is the third element's value. Then the next elements are 6,6,6, which become 0s. Not sure.\n\nWait, in Example 1's output, the 6s seem to be in a diagonal pattern. Looking at the output:\n\nRow 0: [6,6,0,0,0]\nRow1: [0,6,6,0,0]\nRow2: [0,0,6,6,0]\nRow3: [0,0,0,6,6]\nRow4: [6,0,0,0,6]\n\nThis looks like a diagonal band moving from left to right. Each row's 6s start one position to the right of the previous row. So in row 0, positions 0 and 1; row1: 1 and 2; etc. Then row4 starts at 0 again and ends at 4. So perhaps this is a cyclic shift. But how does that relate to the input?\n\nLooking at the input for Example1, perhaps the output is the positions where a certain condition is met. For example, maybe the output is 0 wherever the current cell is equal to the next cell in a certain direction, or something like that. Alternatively, maybe each cell in the output is the value of the cell to the right (or left) in the input, but wrapping around. Let me check the first row of input1's input: [5,5,6,6,6]. The output is [6,6,0,0,0]. So the first two elements of the output are 6, which is the third element of the input. Hmm. Maybe it's taking the next element's value. Let's see:\n\nIn input row0: the elements are 5,5,6,6,6. So for output row0, elements are 6,6,0,0,0. So the first element in output is 6, which is the third element in input. Wait, the third element is 6, which is same as the fourth and fifth. So maybe the output is replacing the current cell with the value two positions to the right, modulo the row length. For example, in the first position (index 0), two positions to the right would be index 2 (0+2=2). The value at index 2 is 6. Then the second position (index1) would look at index3 (1+2=3), which is 6. Then index2 would look at index4 (2+2=4, which is 6). Then index3 would look at (3+2=5 mod5=0), which is 5. So output for index3 would be 5, but the output is 0. Hmm, that doesn't align.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is the value of the cell that is one step clockwise or counter-clockwise in a ring. For example, in a 5-element row, moving each element to the right by one, so the last element becomes first. But not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each cell in the output is set to the value of the cell that is diagonally adjacent in a certain direction. But I'm not seeing it.\n\nWait, let's look at example2. The input is:\n\n[9,5,9,9,9]\n[9,9,5,5,9]\n[9,5,9,9,9]\n[9,9,5,9,9]\n[9,9,9,5,5]\n\nThe output is:\n\n[0,9,0,0,0]\n[0,0,9,9,0]\n[0,9,0,0,0]\n[0,0,9,0,0]\n[0,0,0,9,9]\n\nIn example2's output, the 9s are appearing in positions where the input has 5s. Wait, for example, the first input row has a 5 at index1. The output row0 has a 9 at index1. Similarly, in row1 of input, the 5s are at indices2 and3. The output row1 has 9s at 2 and3. So perhaps the output is replacing 5s in the input with the neighboring value (maybe the next or previous element). Let's check.\n\nIn row0 of example2 input: [9,5,9,9,9]. The 5 is at index1. The output at index1 is9. The elements around index1 are 9 (left) and9 (right). So the 5 is replaced by 9, which is the surrounding value. Similarly, in row1 of input: [9,9,5,5,9]. The 5s at indices2 and3 are surrounded by 9s (left and right). So in the output, those positions are 9. The rest of the elements (9s in input) become0. So maybe the rule is: if the current element is a certain value (maybe the minimum in the grid?), replace it with the value of its neighbor(s), and set others to0.\n\nWait, but in example0, the input has 4 and5. The output replaces 5s with4 and 4s with0. So maybe the 5s are being replaced by the surrounding value (which is4), and the original 4s are turned into0. Similarly, in example1, the input has5 and6. The output replaces5s with6 (the surrounding value?), and 6s become0. Then in example2, the 5s are replaced by9 (the surrounding value), and 9s become0. So the pattern is: for each cell, if the cell's value is the minimum in the grid, replace it with the value of its adjacent cells (assuming they are the same?), else set to0. Wait, but example0: input has 4 and5. So 4 is the minimum. But in the output, 5s are replaced by4, which is the surrounding. Hmm, maybe the opposite: if the cell's value is not the minimum, then replace it with the minimum value if it's adjacent to it. Wait, perhaps the steps are:\n\n1. Find the minimum value in the entire input matrix.\n2. For each cell:\n   a. If the cell's value is the minimum, replace it with the value of the adjacent cells (if they are the same; perhaps the non-minimum value).\n   b. Else, set to0.\n\nBut let's test this with example0.\n\nExample0 input has min 4. So any cell with value5 (which is not min) is replaced by4, and the cells with4 (min) become0. So the output in example0 is correct.\n\nExample1 input: the values are5,5,6,6,6 etc. The minimum is5. So the cells with5 (which is the min) are replaced by the adjacent cells. Wait, but in example1's output, the5s in input are replaced with6. So perhaps, when a cell is the min value, we replace it with the adjacent cell's value (assuming the adjacent is not min). For example, in example0, the5s are replaced by4 (the min), but in example1, the5s (min) are replaced by6. So the process could be: for each cell, if it's the minimum value in the matrix, replace it with the value of its adjacent cell (if adjacent cells are non-min), otherwise set to0. And for non-min cells, set to0.\n\nWait, but in example0, the min is4. The cells with5 are non-min, but in the output they are replaced by4 (the min). That contradicts that idea.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is created by taking each cell and if it's not the minimum value, set it to0. And for the cells that are the minimum, replace them with the value that surrounds them (which is the next higher value). For example, in example0, min is4, but wait no. Wait example0's input has 4 and5. So min is4. So the cells with5 (non-min) are set to0? No, in example0's output, the 5s are replaced with4, not0.\n\nHmm, maybe the rule is:\n\nFor each cell, if it is the maximum value in its row, replace it with the next highest value in that row (or the common value of the surrounding cells), else set to0.\n\nWait, in example0's first row: [4,5,4]. The max is5. So replace5 with4 (since the surrounding cells are4), and set the other 4s to0. But that doesn't fit, because in example0's output, the 5s become4 and the 4s become0.\n\nAlternatively, in each cell, if the cell is higher than its adjacent cells, it is replaced by the adjacent value; otherwise set to0.\n\nFor example, in example0:\n\nThe middle cell (5) is higher than its neighbors (4). So it's replaced by4. The other cells (4) are not higher than their neighbors (since adjacent cells are5 and4, but maybe only horizontal neighbors?), so set to0.\n\nIn example1's first row: [5,5,6,6,6]. The first two 5s have neighbors (5 and6). Maybe 5 is not higher than 6, so set to0? But the output has6 here. Hmm, this doesn't align.\n\nAlternatively, the pattern is that each cell in the output is the minimum value of the original cell's neighbors (excluding itself). If the cell is not surrounded by neighbors of that minimum, then maybe something else.\n\nAlternatively, consider the following approach: the output is a grid where each cell is set to the value of the majority of its adjacent cells (up, down, left, right) if they are different from the cell's own value. Otherwise, it's 0. But this might get complicated.\n\nAlternatively, looking at example0's output, the 5 in the center of the input becomes4, which is the value of the surrounding cells. So perhaps, for any cell that is a local maximum (higher than all adjacent cells), replace it with the value of its adjacent cells. All other cells become0. Let's test this.\n\nIn example0's input, the center cell is5, which is higher than all adjacent4s. So it's replaced by4. The other cells (4) are not local maxima, so set to0. That fits example0.\n\nIn example1's input: let's look at the 5s. Are they local maxima? For example, in the first row [5,5,6,6,6], the 5s are adjacent to 5 and6. So they are not higher than all neighbors. So perhaps they are not local maxima, so their output would be0. But in example1's output, the 5s are replaced by6. Hmm, this doesn't fit.\n\nWait, maybe the rule is: if a cell is part of a \"block\" of the same value that is surrounded by a higher value, then replace it with the surrounding value, else set to0. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is the original grid shifted in some pattern, such as shifting each row to the right by a certain number of positions, and replacing the original cells with the shifted values, but this varies per example.\n\nLooking at example1's output again, the first row of output is [6,6,0,0,0]. The input's first row is [5,5,6,6,6]. The output starts with two6s, which is the third element of the input. Then zeros. So maybe each row is shifted left by two positions? Let's see: shifting left by two would take the third element (index2) to the first position. For input row0: elements [5,5,6,6,6]. Shift left by two would make [6,6,6,5,5], but output is [6,6,0,0,0]. Not matching.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each cell is replaced by the value that is two positions to the right, wrapping around. For example, in row0, element0: 5 \u2192 two positions to the right is index2 (6), so becomes6. Element1: 5 \u2192 index3 (6). Element2:6 \u2192 index4 (6). Elements3:6 \u2192 index0 (5). Element4:6 \u2192 index1 (5). So output would be [6,6,6,5,5]. But the actual output is [6,6,0,0,0]. Doesn't align.\n\nWait, perhaps the output is creating a diagonal pattern where each row's non-zero entries are shifted by one. Like, in example1's output, the first row has non-zeros in columns0-1, next row 1-2, etc. Maybe the test is whether the cell is part of a diagonal, but how does that relate to the input?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is determined by checking if the cell's value is the same as the majority of the surrounding cells. For example, in example0's center cell (5) is surrounded by4s. So replace it with4, and others become0.\n\nBut how does this explain the other examples? Let's check example2.\n\nIn example2's input, there are 5s and9s. The 5s are surrounded by9s. So in the output, the 5s are replaced by9, and 9s become0. So this fits the pattern of replacing a cell with the surrounding value if it's a different value, and setting others to0.\n\nSo the pattern seems to be:\n\nFor each cell in the input grid, if the cell's value is not the same as the majority of its immediate neighbors (or perhaps any neighbor), replace it with the neighbor's value (assuming all neighbors are the same?), otherwise set it to0. Or maybe, if a cell is surrounded by a different value, replace it with that value; else, set to0.\n\nBut how do we determine which neighbor's value to take when they are different?\n\nAlternatively, if a cell's value is not the minimum value in the entire grid, replace it with the minimum value. But in example0, the min is4. The cells with5 (non-min) are replaced by4. The cells with4 (min) are set to0. That fits. Example1's min is5. The cells with5 (min) are set to0? No, example1's output has 6s. Wait, in example1's input, the min is5, but the output cells are6. So that contradicts.\n\nWait, maybe the rule is:\n\n1. Find the value that appears in the border of the grid (the outermost cells). Let's call this the border value.\n2. For each cell in the input, if the cell is part of the border, set it to0.\n3. For cells not on the border, if they have the same value as the border, set them to0.\n4. Otherwise, set them to the border value.\n\nBut let's test this.\n\nExample0's grid is 3x3. The border elements are the first and third rows and first and third columns. The border elements in input are4 and5. Wait, input is:\n\n[4,5,4]\n[5,5,5]\n[4,5,4]\n\nThe border elements are the first and third rows and first and third columns. So the border elements are 4,5,4 in first row; 4 in third row; 5,5,5 in second row (but second row is not a border). Wait, maybe the border is the perimeter. So the first and last rows and first and last columns. So the four corners are (0,0)=4; (0,2)=4; (2,0)=4; (2,2)=4. The edge elements (non-corner) are (0,1)=5; (1,0)=5; (1,2)=5; (2,1)=5. So the border includes all these. The border values are 4 and5. So the border value is a mix. So this theory might not hold.\n\nAlternative approach: perhaps the output grid is formed by taking the original grid and replacing all occurrences of a certain value (e.g., the minimum or maximum) with another value, and setting the rest to0. But example0: input has4 and5. Output has0 and4. So replacing5 with4 and4 with0. So the value being replaced is5, replaced with4, and4 is set to0. Example1: input has5 and6. Output replaces5 with6 and6 with0. Example2: input has5 and9. Output replaces5 with9 and9 with0. So the pattern seems to be: identify a value X in the input (like the middle value or the second lowest), replace X with Y (another value), and set other values to0.\n\nWait, in example0, the middle cell is5. The surrounding cells are4. So Y is4. So all5s are replaced with4, and4s become0.\n\nIn example1, the input has5 and6. The output has6 and0. So5s are replaced with6, and6s become0.\n\nIn example2,5s are replaced with9, and9s become0.\n\nSo the rule is: find all instances of a certain value (let's say, the value that is not the maximum) and replace them with another value (the maximum?), then set the other values to0. Wait, in example0, the maximum is5. But in the output,5s are replaced with4. So maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, the value that is replaced is the one that is not the maximum. For example, in example0,5 is the maximum. So all5s are replaced with4 (which is the other value), and the other values (4) become0. That fits.\n\nExample1: the maximum value is6. So all5s are replaced with6, and6s become0. Which matches the output.\n\nExample2: the maximum is9. So all5s are replaced with9, and9s become0. Which matches the output.\n\nSo the pattern is: for each cell, if the value is not the maximum in the input grid, replace it with the maximum value. Otherwise, set it to0.\n\nWait, let's verify.\n\nExample0: input has4 and5. The maximum is5. So cells with5 (max) become0. Cells with4 (non-max) become5? But in example0's output, the cells that were5 are now4, and the 4s are0. So this contradicts.\n\nHmm, perhaps the opposite. The maximum is replaced with the next highest value, and others are set to0. Or the minimum.\n\nAlternatively, the pattern is: find the value that appears the least number of times (the minority value) and replace it with the majority value. Then set the majority value to0.\n\nIn example0: majority is4 (appears 4 times) and5 appears5 times. Wait, let's count:\n\nInput for example0:\n\nRow0: 4,5,4 \u2192 two4s, one5.\n\nRow1:5,5,5 \u2192 three5s.\n\nRow2:4,5,4 \u2192 two4s, one5.\n\nTotal 4s: 2+2=4.\n\n5s:1+3+1=5.\n\nSo minority is4. Replace4 with5? But the output is replacing5 with4. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, the minority is5 (5 instances) vs4 (4 instances). No, majority is5.\n\nHmm, perhaps it's not based on frequency.\n\nWait, another approach: for each cell, the output is the value of the cell that is two steps to the right in the same row. If that's beyond the row, wrap around. Let's test this.\n\nExample0, row0: [4,5,4]. Two steps to the right from index0 is index2 (4). So output[0] would be4. Then index1: two steps to the right is index3 mod3=0 (4). So output[1]=4. Index2: two steps to the right is index4 mod3=1 (5). So output[2]=5. But the actual output row0 is [0,4,0]. Doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is the value of the cell below the current cell. For example, in example0, the first row's middle cell (5) looks at the cell below it (5 in row1) and becomes4. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, looking for a pattern where the output is the result of a convolution. For example, each cell is replaced by the sum of its neighbors, but modulo something. But in example0, the center cell's neighbors sum to 4+5+4 +5+4 +5+4= let's see, but this seems complicated.\n\nLet me think again.\n\nAnother observation: in example0's output, the non-zero values are4, which is the value of the surrounding cells of the5s in the input. So every5 in the input is replaced by4, and every4 is replaced by0.\n\nIn example1's output, the non-zero is6, which is the value surrounding the5s. So every5 is replaced by6, and6 becomes0.\n\nIn example2's output, the non-zero is9, which is the surrounding of5s. So5s are replaced by9, and9 becomes0.\n\nSo the pattern seems to be:\n\nFor each cell in the input, if the cell's value is the same as a certain target value (probably the one that is not the maximum), replace it with the surrounding value (which is the maximum). The surrounding value is the same for all such cells. Then, the cells that were originally the surrounding value (now the new value) are set to0.\n\nWait, perhaps the steps are:\n\n1. Identify the value that is being surrounded. Let's call this X.\n\n2. Replace all occurrences of X with the value that surrounds it (Y).\n\n3. Set all original Y values to0.\n\nBut how do we determine which value is X?\n\nIn example0, the X is5. It's surrounded by4. So replace5 with4, and set original4s to0.\n\nIn example1, X is5, surrounded by6. Replace5 with6, and set original6s to0.\n\nIn example2, X is5, surrounded by9. Replace5 with9, set original9s to0.\n\nSo the pattern is: find the value that is surrounded by another value. So X is the value that is enclosed by Y. For example, in example0, the 5s are in the center, surrounded by4s. So X=5, Y=4. Replace X with Y, set Y to0.\n\nBut how to determine X and Y automatically from the input.\n\nPerhaps X is the value that forms a cross or a diamond pattern, and Y is the value surrounding it.\n\nAlternatively, X is the value that is present in the center of the grid. Let's check:\n\nExample0 is a 3x3 grid. Center cell is5. So X=5. Y is4.\n\nExample1 is a 5x5 grid. Center cell would be the third row, third column. Input row2 is [6,6,5,5,6]. The center cell is5. So X=5. Y=6.\n\nExample2 is a 5x5 grid. Let's see the center cell. Input rows:\n\nRow0:9,5,9,9,9\n\nRow1:9,9,5,5,9\n\nRow2:9,5,9,9,9\n\nRow3:9,9,5,9,9\n\nRow4:9,9,9,5,5\n\nThe center cell is row2, column2 (indexes 2,2). That cell is9. Hmm, but in the output, the replaced value is9 where the input has5. So maybe this theory is wrong.\n\nAlternatively, X is the value that is not present in the border. For example, in example0, the border has4 and5. But the entire grid has5 in the center. Wait, example0's border includes the perimeter cells. The first and last rows and columns. In example0, the border cells are4 and5. So perhaps X is the value not present on the border. But example0's border has4 and5. So all values are present on the border. So this theory doesn't fit.\n\nAlternative approach: X is the value that is present in the input but not in the output's non-zero elements. For example, in example0, the output's non-zero is4. Input has4 and5. So X is5. Similarly, example1's output non-zero is6. Input has5 and6. X is5. Example2's output non-zero is9. Input has5 and9. X is5. So the rule is: replace all X (which is5 in all training examples) with Y (the other value), and set Y to0.\n\nBut in the test input, the values are3 and5 and3. So according to this pattern, X would be5, replaced by3, and3s become0. But let's look at the test input.\n\nTest input:\n\n[3,3,3,5,3]\n[3,5,3,3,3]\n[3,5,5,3,5]\n[3,3,3,5,3]\n[5,5,5,3,3]\n\nSo according to the pattern, X is5. Replace all5s with3 (the other value), then set all3s to0. But the output would then have0s wherever there was3, and3s where there was5. But wait, according to the previous examples:\n\nOriginal input has two values: X and Y.\n\nIn the output, all X's are replaced by Y, and Y's are replaced by0.\n\nSo in example0: X=5, Y=4. Output has Y where X was, and0 elsewhere.\n\nIn example1: X=5, Y=6. Output has Y where X was,0 elsewhere.\n\nIn example2: X=5, Y=9. Output has Y where X was,0 elsewhere.\n\nSo the pattern is: find the two distinct values in the input. The value that is being replaced (X) is the one that is not present in the output's non-zero cells. So for each cell:\n\n- If the cell is X, replace it with Y.\n- Else, set to0.\n\nBut how to determine which is X and which is Y? Because in all training examples, X is5, and Y is the other value (4,6,9). But in the test input, there are three values:3,5,3. Wait, no. The test input has3 and5. So according to the pattern, X is5, Y is3. So replace all5s with3, and set3s to0. So the output should have3s where there were5s, and0 elsewhere.\n\nBut looking at the test input's first row: [3,3,3,5,3]. Replacing5 with3 gives [3,3,3,3,3]. Then setting all3s to0. So the output row would be [0,0,0,0,0]. But looking at the training examples, the outputs have the non-zero elements in specific positions. For example, in example1, the output has6s where the input had5s, and0 elsewhere.\n\nSo applying this pattern to the test input, the output should have3s where there were5s, and0 elsewhere.\n\nBut looking at the test input:\n\nOriginal input's5s are in positions:\n\nRow0: index3.\n\nRow1: index1.\n\nRow2: indices1,2,4.\n\nRow3: index3.\n\nRow4: indices0,1,2.\n\nSo the output should have3s in those positions, and0 elsewhere.\n\nSo for example, the first row of the test output would be [0,0,0,3,0].\n\nSecond row: [0,3,0,0,0].\n\nThird row: [0,3,3,0,3].\n\nFourth row: [0,0,0,3,0].\n\nFifth row: [3,3,3,0,0].\n\nBut let's see if this matches the training examples.\n\nIn example0, the input has5s in the center. The output has4s in those positions, others0. Which matches this pattern.\n\nIn example1, output has6s where input had5s.\n\nSo yes, this seems to be the pattern.\n\nBut in the test input, there's also a possibility that X is3 and Y is5. Wait, but in the training examples, X is always the non-Y value. For example, in example0, X=5 and Y=4. So X is the value that is replaced by Y. But how do we determine which value is X and which is Y?\n\nLooking at the training examples, the Y is the value that forms the \"background\" surrounding X. So in example0, the surrounding of X (5) is Y=4. So Y is the value that is more prevalent around X. Similarly, in example1, the Y=6 is surrounding X=5. So the pattern is: Y is the value that is adjacent to X cells, and X is the value that is enclosed.\n\nBut in the test input, the5s are surrounded by3s. For example, in the first row:5 is between3s. So Y=3, X=5. So replace5s with3 and set3s to0. So the output would have3s where there were5s, and0 elsewhere.\n\nBut looking at the test input's fifth row: [5,5,5,3,3]. The5s are in the first three positions,3s in last two. Replacing5s with3 gives3,3,3,3,3. Then setting3s to0 gives all0s. So the fifth row would be [0,0,0,0,0], but according to the training examples, perhaps there's a different pattern.\n\nWait, but in example1, the5s are surrounded by6s. The output replaces5s with6s, and6s become0. So the output's non-zero positions are where the5s were. So in the test input's case, replacing5s with3 and3s with0 would result in the output having3s in the positions where5s were, and0 elsewhere.\n\nSo the final output for the test input would be:\n\n[0,0,0,3,0]\n\n[0,3,0,0,0]\n\n[0,3,3,0,3]\n\n[0,0,0,3,0]\n\n[3,3,3,0,0]\n\nBut let's check if this fits the pattern of the training examples. For example, in example1, the input's5s are replaced by6, and6s become0, resulting in the output's6s exactly where the5s were. Similarly, example0's output has4s where5s were. So this seems correct.\n\nThus, the final answer should be the test input's5s replaced by3, and all other elements set to0."
