        "cot_1": "Okay, let's see. I need to figure out the pattern between the input and output in the training examples and then apply it to the test input. \n\nLooking at Example 0:\n\nInput lists are [3,3,3,3,3,3] and [9,9,9,9,9,9]. The outputs are [3,9,3,9,3,9] and [9,3,9,3,9,3]. Hmm, it looks like the first output alternates between the elements of the first and second input lists. So 3 from the first list, then 9 from the second, then 3 again, and so on. The second output list starts with the second input's element first, then alternates. So the two output lists are interleaving the original two lists but starting with different ones. \n\nLet me check Example 1 to confirm. Inputs are [4,4,4,4,4,4] and [8,8,8,8,8,8]. Outputs are [4,8,4,8,4,8] and [8,4,8,4,8,4]. Yep, same pattern. The first output alternates starting with the first input's element, the second output starts with the second input's element. \n\nSo the pattern is: create two new lists. The first output list alternates between the elements of the first input list and the second, starting with the first. The second output list alternates starting with the second input's elements. But since all elements in each input list are the same, it just alternates between the two numbers. \n\nNow, applying this to the test input. The inputs are [6,6,6,6,6,6] and [2,2,2,2,2,2]. Following the same pattern, the first output list should be [6,2,6,2,6,2] and the second should be [2,6,2,6,2,6]. \n\nWait, but each input list has 6 elements. The output lists in the examples also have 6 elements each. So for each output list, we take three elements from each input. Since each input element is the same, the outputs are just alternating the two values three times each. So the test case should follow exactly that.",

        "cot_2": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. So, looking at the training examples.\n\nIn Example 0, the input has two lists: all 3s and all 9s. The output is two lists where they alternate between 3 and 9. The first output list is [3,9,3,9,3,9], and the second is [9,3,9,3,9,3]. So it seems like the first output list starts with the first element of the first input list, then the first element of the second, and alternates. Then the second output list does the opposite, starting with the second input's element first.\n\nWait, let me check Example 1. Inputs are all 4s and 8s. The outputs are alternating 4 and 8 for the first list, and 8 and 4 for the second. So same pattern here. So the transformation is taking elements from the two input lists alternately in the output lists. But each output list alternates between the two inputs, but the first output starts with the first input's element, and the second output starts with the second input's element.\n\nSo, for each position in the output lists, the first output list has elements from the first input list and then the second input list, alternating. The second output list does the reverse: starts with the second input's element, then the first, alternating.\n\nBut how are they arranged? Let me see the lengths. Each input list has 6 elements, and the output lists also have 6 elements. So for example, in Example 0, the first input list is six 3s, and the second is six 9s. The output lists alternate between 3 and 9, three times each. So maybe each element from the input lists is being interleaved. But since all elements in each input list are the same, it's easier. But the output lists are interleaving the first element of each input list. Wait, but the input lists are all the same elements. So the key is that the output lists are formed by alternating the elements of the two input lists. But each output list alternates in a different order.\n\nSo for the first output list: take first element from the first input list, then first from the second, then second from the first, second from the second, etc. But wait, no, because in the examples, the input lists are all same elements. So for example, in Example 0, the first output is [3,9,3,9,3,9]. That's three pairs of 3 and 9. The second output is the reverse: 9 and 3 each time.\n\nWait, maybe the first output list is taking elements in order: first list's element, second list's element, repeated three times. The second output list is taking second list's element, first list's element, repeated three times.\n\nYes, because each input list is length 6. So for the first output, each element alternates between the first and second input elements. So positions 0, 2, 4 are from the first input, positions 1,3,5 are from the second input. Then the second output list is positions 0,2,4 from the second input and 1,3,5 from the first input.\n\nBut since all elements in each input list are the same, it's just alternating between the two values. So the outputs are constructed by interleaving the two inputs' elements. The first output starts with the first input's element, the second output starts with the second input's element.\n\nSo applying this to the test input. The test input is [6,6,6,6,6,6] and [2,2,2,2,2,2]. Following the pattern, the first output list should be [6,2,6,2,6,2] and the second output list should be [2,6,2,6,2,6]. That matches the structure of the training examples. Let's check:\n\nFor Example 0: input lists are 3s and 9s. Output 1 is 3,9 repeating. Output 2 is 9,3 repeating.\n\nSimilarly, for the test input, output 1 would be 6,2 repeating, output 2 would be 2,6 repeating. So the answer should be those two lists."
