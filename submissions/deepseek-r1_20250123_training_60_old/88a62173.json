        "cot_1": "Okay, let's see. I need to figure out the pattern between the input and output in the training examples and then apply it to the test input. Let's start by looking at the examples one by one.\n\nLooking at Example 0:\n\nINPUT:\n[0, 2, 0, 0, 2]\n[2, 2, 0, 2, 2]\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[0, 2, 0, 2, 2]\n[2, 2, 0, 2, 0]\n\nOUTPUT:\n[2, 2]\n[2, 0]\n\nHmm, the input is a 5x5 grid. The output is two rows with two elements each. So maybe the output is derived by taking certain elements from the input grid. Let's check the positions.\n\nLooking at the output rows. For the first output row [2,2], maybe they're taking elements from specific positions in the input. Let's check the input rows.\n\nIn Example 0, the first row of the output is [2,2]. Let's see if these correspond to the first and last elements of the first input row. The first input row is [0,2,0,0,2]. The first element is 0, last is 2. But the output starts with 2. That doesn't match. Alternatively, maybe looking at columns.\n\nWait, maybe the output is formed by taking the elements from the second and fourth rows (since there's a middle row of zeros which might separate them). Let's look at the second row of the input (index 1): [2,2,0,2,2]. The first element is 2, last is 2. Then the fourth row (index 3): [0,2,0,2,2]. The first element is 0, last is 2. But the output is [2,2] and [2,0]. Wait, the output has two rows. So maybe the first output row is from row 1 (second row) of the input, taking elements 0 and 4 (first and last). In the second input row, elements 0 and 4 are both 2. So [2,2], which matches the first output row. Then the fourth input row (index 3) is [0,2,0,2,2], first element 0 and last element 2. But the output's second row is [2,0]. That doesn't match. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is taking elements from the first and last elements of the second and fourth rows. Wait, the output has two rows. Let's see in Example 0's output, first row [2,2], which could be the first and last elements of the second input row (which are 2 and 2). Then the second output row [2,0] could be the first and last elements of the fourth input row? The fourth input row is [0,2,0,2,2], first element 0, last 2. That would give [0,2], which doesn't match [2,0]. So that's not right.\n\nWait maybe the output is taking columns instead. The input is 5 rows. The output is two rows of two elements each. Maybe columns 0 and 4 (the first and last columns), but for specific rows. Let's check.\n\nIn Example 0's input:\n\nRow 0: [0,2,0,0,2] \u2192 columns 0 and 4: 0,2\nRow 1: [2,2,0,2,2] \u2192 2,2\nRow 3: [0,2,0,2,2] \u2192 0,2\nRow 4: [2,2,0,2,0] \u2192 2,0\n\nThe output is two rows: [2,2] and [2,0]. That matches rows 1 and 4. So maybe the output is combining rows 1 and 4's first and last elements. But why those rows?\n\nLooking at Example 1's input and output:\n\nINPUT:\n[1,0,0,1,0]\n[0,1,0,0,1]\n[0,0,0,0,0]\n[1,0,0,1,0]\n[1,1,0,0,1]\n\nOUTPUT:\n[1,0]\n[1,1]\n\nSo applying the same logic. The output has two rows. Let's check the first and last elements of rows 1 and 4.\n\nRow 1: [0,1,0,0,1] \u2192 first element 0, last 1 \u2192 but output first row is [1,0], which doesn't match. Hmm.\n\nWait perhaps the output is rows 0 and 3? Let's check.\n\nExample 1's input row 0: [1,0,0,1,0] \u2192 first 1, last 0 \u2192 [1,0], which matches the first output row. Then row 4: [1,1,0,0,1] \u2192 first 1, last 1 \u2192 [1,1], which matches the second output row. So maybe the output takes the first and last elements of the first and fourth rows (rows 0 and 4) of the input.\n\nBut in Example 0, the output rows are [2,2] and [2,0]. The input's row 0 is [0,2,0,0,2] \u2192 0 and 2. So that's [0,2], which doesn't match the output. But in Example 0's output, the first output row is [2,2], which would correspond to row 1's first and last elements (2 and 2), and row 4's first and last elements (2 and 0). So maybe it's rows 1 and 4.\n\nWait in Example 0's output, first row [2,2] is from row 1 (input row 1's first and last), and second row [2,0] is from row 4's first and last (2 and 0). So perhaps the output is taking the first and last elements of rows 1 and 4.\n\nIn Example 1's input, rows 1 and 4:\n\nRow1: [0,1,0,0,1] \u2192 0 and 1 \u2192 [0,1]. But output's first row is [1,0]. That doesn't match. So that can't be.\n\nAlternatively, maybe rows 0 and 3. For Example 1:\n\nRow0: [1,0,0,1,0] \u2192 1 and 0 \u2192 [1,0] which matches the first output row.\n\nRow3: [1,0,0,1,0] \u2192 1 and 0. But the second output row is [1,1]. So that's not matching.\n\nHmm, maybe the output is taking rows that are adjacent to the middle row (row 2 which is all zeros). Let's see. The input has 5 rows. The middle row (third row) is all zeros. Then the rows above and below the middle row. So rows 1 and 3 (since the input has rows 0,1,2,3,4). So rows 1 and 3.\n\nIn Example 0:\n\nRow1: [2,2,0,2,2] \u2192 first and last elements: 2 and 2 \u2192 [2,2].\n\nRow3: [0,2,0,2,2] \u2192 first 0, last 2 \u2192 [0,2]. But the output's second row is [2,0]. Hmm, not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rows adjacent to the middle, but in different positions. Wait, the middle row is row 2. So rows 1 and 3 are adjacent. Let's check in Example 1.\n\nRow1: [0,1,0,0,1] \u2192 first and last: 0 and 1.\n\nRow3: [1,0,0,1,0] \u2192 1 and 0. The output is [1,0] and [1,1]. So combining these two would give [0,1] and [1,0], but that's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the first and last elements of the rows that are mirrored around the middle row. For example, row 1 and row 3 (since row 2 is the middle). Then take first element of row1 and last element of row3, and vice versa?\n\nIn Example 0:\n\nRow1 first:2, row3 last:2 \u2192 2 and 2 \u2192 first output row.\n\nRow3 first:0, row1 last:2 \u2192 0 and 2. But the second output row is [2,0]. Not matching.\n\nHmm, this approach isn't working.\n\nLet me think differently. The output has two rows, each with two elements. Let's check if the output is formed by taking the middle element of certain rows or columns.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is the first and last non-zero elements in each row. Wait, but in Example 0's first output row [2,2], maybe from row1's first and last elements which are 2 and 2. Then row4's first and last elements are 2 and 0. So output rows are rows1 and 4. But in Example1, output rows are [1,0] and [1,1]. Let's see:\n\nExample1 input:\n\nRow0: [1,0,0,1,0] \u2192 first and last 1 and 0 \u2192 [1,0] which is the first output row.\n\nRow4: [1,1,0,0,1] \u2192 first 1, last 1 \u2192 [1,1], which is the second output row.\n\nSo in Example1, output is first and last elements of rows 0 and 4.\n\nBut in Example0, if the output was rows1 and4:\n\nRow1: [2,2,0,2,2] \u2192 first and last 2 and 2 \u2192 [2,2].\n\nRow4: [2,2,0,2,0] \u2192 first and last 2 and 0 \u2192 [2,0].\n\nWhich matches the output.\n\nSo the pattern here is that the output consists of the first and last elements of the first and last rows of the input. Wait, but in Example0, the first row is row0 [0,2,0,0,2], but the output's first row is from row1. So that contradicts.\n\nWait, perhaps the output is taking the first and last elements of the second and fifth rows (rows1 and4) of the input. Let's check all examples:\n\nExample0: rows1 and4.\n\nRow1: 2,2 \u2192 [2,2].\n\nRow4: 2,0 \u2192 [2,0]. Matches output.\n\nExample1: rows0 and4.\n\nRow0:1,0 \u2192 [1,0].\n\nRow4:1,1 \u2192 [1,1]. Matches output.\n\nWait, that's inconsistent. So why in Example0 they take rows1 and4, but in Example1 rows0 and4? That doesn't make sense. Maybe there's another pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the first and last elements of the topmost and bottommost non-zero rows (excluding the middle zero row). Let's check.\n\nIn Example0, the middle row is all zeros. The rows above are rows0,1 and below are rows3,4. The topmost non-zero row would be row0, but row0 is [0,2,0,0,2]. The first element is 0. But the output's first row is [2,2], which comes from row1. So perhaps not.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output takes rows that are symmetric with respect to the middle row. For instance, row1 and row3 (since row2 is middle). Let's check:\n\nExample0:\n\nRow1: [2,2,0,2,2] \u2192 first and last:2,2 \u2192 [2,2].\n\nRow3: [0,2,0,2,2] \u2192 first 0, last 2 \u2192 [0,2]. But the output is [2,2] and [2,0]. Hmm, not matching.\n\nWait in Example0's output, the second row is [2,0], which comes from row4's first and last (2 and0). So perhaps the output is rows1 and4.\n\nBut why in Example1 it's rows0 and4?\n\nLooking at Example2's input and output:\n\nINPUT:\n[8,8,0,0,8]\n[8,0,0,8,0]\n[0,0,0,0,0]\n[8,8,0,8,8]\n[8,0,0,8,0]\n\nOUTPUT:\n[0,8]\n[8,0]\n\nSo the output is two rows. Let's see:\n\nFirst output row [0,8] could be first and last elements of some row. Looking at the input rows:\n\nRow0: 8 and8 \u2192 [8,8].\n\nRow1:8 and0 \u2192 [8,0].\n\nRow3:8 and8 \u2192 [8,8].\n\nRow4:8 and0 \u2192 [8,0].\n\nBut the output is [0,8] and [8,0]. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe the output is taking the first element of row3 and the last element of row0. For example, row3 first element is 8, row0's last is8 \u2192 but output's first row is [0,8]. Doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the first and last elements of the rows that are mirror images across the middle. For example, row1 and row3. Let's see:\n\nRow1:8 and0 \u2192 [8,0].\n\nRow3:8 and8 \u2192 [8,8].\n\nBut output is [0,8] and [8,0]. Not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's row0 and row4. Row0:8,8 \u2192 [8,8]. Row4:8,0 \u2192 [8,0]. Output is [0,8] and [8,0]. No.\n\nWait, looking at Example2's output [0,8] and [8,0]. Where do these come from? Let's check the input rows. \n\nRow3 is [8,8,0,8,8], first element 8, last 8 \u2192 [8,8].\n\nRow4 is [8,0,0,8,0] \u2192 first 8, last 0 \u2192 [8,0].\n\nBut output's first row is [0,8]. Maybe it's the first element of row4 (8) and the last element of row3 (8) \u2192 but that would be [8,8]. Doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is constructed from the middle columns. Let's see:\n\nIn Example0, the middle column (index 2) is all zeros. So maybe columns 1 and 3.\n\nWait, for Example0's input:\n\nColumns:\n\nColumn0: [0,2,0,0,2] \u2192 0,2,0,0,2 \u2192 but output is [2,2], [2,0]. Not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the two elements adjacent to the middle element of the middle row. But the middle row is all zeros. So maybe the elements above and below the middle row's middle element. The middle element is position (2,2). The elements above and below are (1,2) and (3,2). In Example0, those are 0 and 0. But the output is [2,2] and [2,0]. Doesn't fit.\n\nHmm, maybe the pattern is different. Let's look at the positions of the numbers in the output. For Example0, the first output row is [2,2], which could be the first element of the second row (row1) and the last element of the second row (row1). Which they are. Then the second output row is the first element of the fifth row (row4) and the last element of the fifth row. So maybe output is the first and last elements of the second and fifth rows.\n\nIn Example1, the output is [1,0] and [1,1]. The second row (row1) of the input is [0,1,0,0,1], so first and last elements 0 and1. But the output first row is [1,0], which is reversed. Oh! Maybe the output is the first element of row1 and the last element of row0? Or some other combination.\n\nWait, Example1's first output row is [1,0]. The first element could be from row0's first element (1) and row0's last element (0). So combining those gives [1,0]. The second output row is [1,1], which could be from row4's first and last elements (1 and1).\n\nSimilarly, in Example0, the first output row is [2,2], which could be row1's first and last (2 and2), and the second row [2,0] is row4's first and last (2 and0).\n\nIn Example2's output, the first row is [0,8], and the second is [8,0]. Let's check:\n\nIf the first output row is row1's first (8) and row0's last (8) \u2192 [8,8], which doesn't match. Alternatively, row3's first (8) and row4's last (0) \u2192 [8,0], which is the second output row. But the first output row is [0,8]. Maybe row0's first is8, but output is0. Hmm.\n\nWait in Example2's input:\n\nRow0: [8,8,0,0,8] \u2192 first 8, last 8.\n\nRow1: [8,0,0,8,0] \u2192 first 8, last 0.\n\nRow3: [8,8,0,8,8] \u2192 first8, last8.\n\nRow4: [8,0,0,8,0] \u2192 first8, last0.\n\nThe output is [0,8] and [8,0]. Where do these come from? The first output element 0 could be from row3's second element (8) \u2192 no. Wait, perhaps the output is taking the second and fourth rows (rows1 and3), but taking their middle elements? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is constructed by looking for pairs of elements that sum to a certain value. For Example0, 2 and 2 sum to 4, 2 and 0 sum to 2. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's looking at the rows that are not all-zero (excluding the middle row) and taking certain elements. Let's see:\n\nIn Example0, the non-zero rows are row0,1,3,4. The output has two rows, so maybe the first and last non-zero rows. The first non-zero row is row0: [0,2,0,0,2], but first element 0 and last 2. Output's first row is [2,2], which doesn't match. So that's not it.\n\nAnother approach: in each training example, the output is two rows. Each output row has two elements. Let's think of the input grid as a 5x5 matrix, and the output is a 2x2 matrix. How to reduce 5x5 to 2x2. One common way is taking every other row and column. But let's check.\n\nIn Example0's input:\n\nRows 0,1,3,4 (excluding the middle row). Then columns 0 and4 (first and last). So taking rows1 and4, columns0 and4:\n\nRow1: [2,2,0,2,2] \u2192 columns0 and4: 2,2.\n\nRow4: [2,2,0,2,0] \u2192 columns0 and4:2,0.\n\nSo the output would be [[2,2],[2,0]], which matches Example0's output.\n\nSimilarly, Example1:\n\nRows0,1,3,4 (excluding middle row). Take rows0 and4, columns0 and4.\n\nRow0: [1,0,0,1,0] \u2192 1,0.\n\nRow4: [1,1,0,0,1] \u2192 1,1.\n\nSo output [[1,0],[1,1]], which matches Example1.\n\nExample2's input:\n\nRows0,1,3,4. Take rows1 and4, columns0 and4.\n\nRow1: [8,0,0,8,0] \u2192 8,0.\n\nRow4: [8,0,0,8,0] \u21928,0.\n\nBut the output is [0,8] and [8,0]. Hmm, that doesn't fit. Wait, in Example2's output, it's [[0,8],[8,0]]. So maybe the selected rows are row3 and row4?\n\nRow3: [8,8,0,8,8] \u2192 columns0 and4:8,8.\n\nRow4: [8,0,0,8,0] \u21928,0. That would give [[8,8],[8,0]], which doesn't match the output.\n\nAlternatively, maybe selecting rows0 and3.\n\nRow0:8,8.\n\nRow3:8,8 \u2192 output would be [[8,8],[8,8]], which is not the case.\n\nHmm, but in Example2's output, the first row is [0,8]. Where could 0 come from? Looking at row1's column4 is 0. Or row3's column0 is8, row0's column4 is8. Not sure.\n\nWait let's re-examine Example2's output:\n\n[0,8]\n[8,0]\n\nLooking at the input, maybe the output is constructed by taking the first element of row3 and the last element of row0. Row3's first element is8, row0's last is8 \u2192 [8,8], which isn't the case.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is taking the first element of row3 and the last element of row1. Row3's first is8, row1's last is0 \u2192 [8,0], which is the second output row. The first output row [0,8] could be the first element of row1 (8) and last element of row3 (8) \u2192 [8,8]. Doesn't match.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is taking the second and fourth rows (excluding the middle), but not the first and last. Let's see.\n\nExample2's input rows1 and3:\n\nRow1: [8,0,0,8,0] \u2192 columns0 and4:8,0 \u2192 [8,0].\n\nRow3: [8,8,0,8,8] \u2192 columns0 and4:8,8 \u2192 [8,8].\n\nBut output is [0,8] and [8,0]. Not matching.\n\nThis is confusing. Let me think again.\n\nAnother approach: maybe the output is the elements that are mirrored across the vertical middle axis. For example, in a 5x5 grid, the middle column is index 2. So for each row, the first and last elements are mirrored, but perhaps in the output, they are combined. But not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the first and last elements of the first and last rows after removing the middle row. Let's check.\n\nIn Example0, after removing the middle row (row2), we have rows0,1,3,4. Then take the first and last elements of the first and last of these remaining rows. So first is row0: first 0, last 2. Last is row4: first2, last0. So output rows would be [0,2] and [2,0], which doesn't match the actual output [2,2] and [2,0]. So that's not right.\n\nWait, maybe it's the first and last of the second and fourth rows in the original input (including the middle row). For Example0:\n\nRows1 and3 (second and fourth rows, 0-indexed as 1 and3):\n\nRow1: first 2, last 2 \u2192 [2,2].\n\nRow3: first0, last2 \u2192 [0,2]. But the output's second row is [2,0]. Not matching.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking the elements from the positions (1,0), (1,4), (3,0), (3,4) and arranging them into two rows. Let's check:\n\nFor Example0:\n\n(1,0) is 2, (1,4) is 2 \u2192 first row [2,2].\n\n(3,0) is0, (3,4) is2 \u2192 [0,2]. But output's second row is [2,0]. Doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe (1,0) and (3,4), and (3,0) and (1,4). So first row [2,2], second row [0,2]. Not matching.\n\nBut the output's second row in Example0 is [2,0], which could be row4's first and last elements. So perhaps the output is rows1 and4's first and last elements.\n\nBut why in Example1 it's rows0 and4.\n\nWait, let's check all examples again with this approach.\n\nExample0:\n\nRows1 and4 \u2192 [2,2] and [2,0]. Correct.\n\nExample1:\n\nRows0 and4 \u2192 [1,0] and [1,1]. Correct.\n\nExample2:\n\nRows1 and4 \u2192 [8,0] and [8,0]. But the output is [0,8] and [8,0]. So that doesn't fit. So this approach is inconsistent.\n\nBut wait, the output for Example2 is [0,8] and [8,0]. Let's look at the input for Example2:\n\nRows1 is [8,0,0,8,0] \u2192 first8, last0.\n\nRow3: [8,8,0,8,8] \u2192 first8, last8.\n\nRow4: [8,0,0,8,0] \u2192 first8, last0.\n\nHmm. How to get [0,8] and [8,0].\n\nWait, maybe the output rows are row3 and row4. Row3's first and last:8 and8 \u2192 [8,8]. Row4's first and last:8 and0 \u2192 [8,0]. But the output is [0,8] and [8,0].\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is taking the last element of row0 and first element of row3. Row0's last is8, row3's first is8 \u2192 [8,8]. Doesn't match.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the non-zero elements from certain positions.\n\nExample2's output first row [0,8]. Where is 0 and 8 in the input? Looking at row3's first element is8, row1's first is8, row0's first is8. So where is 0?\n\nMaybe the output is the elements diagonally opposite. For example, row1's last (0) and row4's first (8). So [0,8], and row3's first (8) and row4's last (0). So [8,0]. That would form the output. So the first row is the last element of row1 and the first element of row4. Second row is the first element of row3 and the last element of row4.\n\nLet's see:\n\nExample2:\n\nRow1 last element:0.\n\nRow4 first element:8 \u2192 [0,8].\n\nRow3 first element:8.\n\nRow4 last element:0 \u2192 [8,0]. Which matches the output.\n\nExample0:\n\nRow1 last element:2.\n\nRow4 first element:2 \u2192 [2,2].\n\nRow3 first element:0.\n\nRow4 last element:0 \u2192 [0,0]. But the output is [2,0]. So this doesn't match.\n\nHmm, this approach works for Example2 but not for others.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is taking the elements from the first and last columns of the second and fourth rows (rows1 and3). Let's check Example2:\n\nRow1: columns0 and4 \u2192 8 and0 \u2192 [8,0].\n\nRow3: columns0 and4 \u21928 and8 \u2192 [8,8]. But output is [0,8] and [8,0]. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's rows0 and4's first and last elements, but reversed. For Example0, rows0 and4:\n\nRow0:0 and2 \u2192 [0,2], reversed [2,0]. But output's first row is [2,2]. Doesn't fit.\n\nThis is getting frustrating. Let's try another angle.\n\nLooking at all examples, the output is two rows, each with two elements. The test input is a 5x5 grid with a middle row of zeros. So maybe the pattern is to take certain rows and certain columns.\n\nAnother observation: in Example0 and Example1, the output rows are the first and last elements of the first and last non-middle rows. For Example0, rows1 and4. For Example1, rows0 and4. For Example2, maybe rows0 and3.\n\nWait, let's check:\n\nExample0: output rows [2,2] and [2,0] \u2192 from rows1 and4.\n\nExample1: output rows [1,0] and [1,1] \u2192 from rows0 and4.\n\nExample2: output rows [0,8] and [8,0] \u2192 which could be from rows1 and4.\n\nExample2's rows1 and4:\n\nRow1: [8,0,0,8,0] \u2192 first8, last0 \u2192 [8,0].\n\nRow4: [8,0,0,8,0] \u2192 first8, last0 \u2192 [8,0].\n\nBut output is [0,8] and [8,0]. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, rows3 and4:\n\nRow3: [8,8,0,8,8] \u2192 first8, last8 \u2192 [8,8].\n\nRow4: [8,0,0,8,0] \u2192 first8, last0 \u2192 [8,0].\n\nBut output is [0,8] and [8,0]. So no.\n\nWait, maybe the output is taking rows that have the same elements as other rows. For instance, in Example0, row1 and row4 are different. Example1's rows0 and4 are different.\n\nExample2's rows1 and4 are the same. Their output is [0,8] and [8,0]. So perhaps for Example2, the output is taking the reverse of one of the rows.\n\nRow1's first and last:8,0 \u2192 reversed [0,8]. Row4's first and last:8,0 \u2192 reversed [0,8]. But the output has [0,8] and [8,0]. So maybe one row is reversed and the other is not. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking the first and last elements of the first and last rows that are not the middle row and not all-zero. For Example0, the non-middle rows are rows0,1,3,4. Among these, rows0 and4 are the first and last. Their first and last elements:\n\nRow0:0,2 \u2192 [0,2].\n\nRow4:2,0 \u2192 [2,0]. But output is [2,2] and [2,0]. Doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. Let's think of the input as two parts: the top part (rows 0-1) and the bottom part (rows3-4). Maybe the output is formed by combining elements from the top and bottom parts.\n\nFor Example0:\n\nTop part rows0 and1: row0 first 0, row1 last 2 \u2192 [0,2]?\n\nNo, output is [2,2]. Not matching.\n\nAlternatively, take the first and last elements of row1 (top) and row3 (bottom):\n\nRow1:2,2 \u2192 [2,2].\n\nRow3:0,2 \u2192 [0,2]. Output is [2,2] and [2,0]. Doesn't fit.\n\nThis is really tricky. Let's summarize the findings so far:\n\n- The output is two rows, each with two elements.\n\n- The middle row of the input is all zeros.\n\n- In Example0, the output comes from row1 and row4's first and last elements.\n\n- In Example1, the output comes from row0 and row4's first and last elements.\n\n- In Example2, the output is [0,8] and [8,0], which doesn't directly match any row's first and last elements.\n\nLooking for a common pattern in all three examples.\n\nExample0's output: [2,2], [2,0].\n\nRow1: [2,2,0,2,2] \u2192 first 2, last 2 \u2192 [2,2].\n\nRow4: [2,2,0,2,0] \u2192 first 2, last 0 \u2192 [2,0].\n\nExample1's output: [1,0], [1,1].\n\nRow0: [1,0,0,1,0] \u2192 first 1, last 0 \u2192 [1,0].\n\nRow4: [1,1,0,0,1] \u2192 first 1, last 1 \u2192 [1,1].\n\nExample2's output: [0,8], [8,0].\n\nLooking for a pattern here, perhaps the output is the first and last elements of the first and last non-zero rows in the input. But in Example0, the first non-zero row is row0 (which starts with 0), but the output uses row1. So that's not it.\n\nAlternatively, the output is the first and last elements of the first and last rows that are not the middle row. So for Example0, rows0,1,3,4. First row0:0,2. Last row4:2,0. So output would be [0,2] and [2,0]. But the actual output is [2,2] and [2,0]. Doesn't fit.\n\nWait, maybe the output is the first and last elements of the second and fifth rows (rows1 and4) of the input. This works for Example0 and Example2.\n\nExample0:\n\nRow1:2,2 \u2192 [2,2].\n\nRow4:2,0 \u2192 [2,0]. Correct.\n\nExample2's rows1 and4:\n\nRow1:8,0 \u2192 [8,0].\n\nRow4:8,0 \u2192 [8,0]. But output is [0,8] and [8,0]. So this doesn't fit.\n\nBut in Example2's output, the first row is [0,8]. Where is 0 from? Maybe it's the last element of row0 (8) and the first element of row1 (8) \u2192 no.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the first and last elements of rows3 and4.\n\nExample2's row3:8,8 \u2192 [8,8].\n\nRow4:8,0 \u2192 [8,0]. But output is [0,8] and [8,0]. Doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. Another thought: maybe the output is the first and last elements of the rows that are directly above and below the middle row. The middle row is row2. So rows1 and3.\n\nExample0:\n\nRow1:2,2 \u2192 [2,2].\n\nRow3:0,2 \u2192 [0,2]. Output is [2,2] and [2,0]. Doesn't fit.\n\nExample1:\n\nRow1:0,1 \u2192 [0,1].\n\nRow3:1,0 \u2192 [1,0]. Output is [1,0] and [1,1]. Doesn't fit.\n\nExample2:\n\nRow1:8,0 \u2192 [8,0].\n\nRow3:8,8 \u2192 [8,8]. Output is [0,8] and [8,0]. Doesn't fit.\n\nNot working.\n\nAnother idea: the output is formed by swapping the first and last elements of certain rows. For Example2, if we take row1's first and last (8,0) and swap them, we get [0,8], which is the first output row. Similarly, row4's first and last (8,0) swapped gives [0,8], but the output's second row is [8,0]. So perhaps for Example2, the first row is the swapped row1, and the second row is row4's original.\n\nBut why then in Example0 and Example1 the output isn't swapped.\n\nExample0 row1's first and last are 2 and2 \u2192 swapped same. So output [2,2].\n\nRow4's first and last are 2 and0 \u2192 swapped would be [0,2]. But output is [2,0]. So no.\n\nExample1's row0 is [1,0,0,1,0] \u2192 first1, last0 \u2192 swapped [0,1]. But output's first row is [1,0]. Not swapped.\n\nThis approach only works for Example2. So maybe the pattern is different for each example, but that's unlikely.\n\nAlternative approach: let's count the number of occurrences of each element in the input and output. For Example0:\n\nInput elements: lots of 2s and 0s. Output has 2s and 0s. Not helpful.\n\nAnother angle: the output is a 2x2 matrix where each element is the sum or product of certain elements. But in Example0's output, 2 and 2 sum to 4, but output is 2,2. Doesn't seem like.\n\nAlternatively, the output is the two elements that appear most frequently in the input. But in Example0, 2 appears most, but the output has 2s and a 0. Not sure.\n\nWait, maybe the output is the two elements from the middle column's first and last elements (excluding the middle row). For Example0, the middle column is index2. First row (row0) column2 is0, last row (row4) column2 is0. So [0,0], which isn't the output.\n\nHmm. This is really challenging. Let's look for another pattern.\n\nLooking at Example2's input and output again:\n\nInput:\n\n[8,8,0,0,8] \u2192 row0\n\n[8,0,0,8,0] \u2192 row1\n\n[0,0,0,0,0] \u2192 row2\n\n[8,8,0,8,8] \u2192 row3\n\n[8,0,0,8,0] \u2192 row4\n\nOutput:\n\n[0,8]\n\n[8,0]\n\nThe output rows are [0,8] and [8,0]. These could be the first and last elements of row1 and row4's first and last elements, but swapped. For example, row1's first is8, last is0 \u2192 swapped to [0,8]. Row4's first is8, last is0 \u2192 swapped to [0,8]. But the output's second row is [8,0], which isn't swapped. So maybe only one row is swapped. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is formed by taking the first element of the second row (row1) and the last element of the fourth row (row3). Row1's first is8, row3's last is8 \u2192 [8,8]. Doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the elements from the positions (row1, col4) and (row3, col0). For Example2:\n\nrow1, col4 is0 \u2192 first element.\n\nrow3, col0 is8 \u2192 second element. So [0,8].\n\nSecond output row: row4, col0 is8 and row4, col4 is0 \u2192 [8,0]. This matches the output. So for Example2's output, the first row is the last element of row1 and first element of row3. The second row is the first and last elements of row4.\n\nLet's check if this pattern applies to other examples.\n\nExample0:\n\nFirst output row: last element of row1 is2, first element of row3 is0 \u2192 [2,0]. But actual output is [2,2]. Doesn't fit.\n\nExample1:\n\nFirst output row: last element of row1 is1, first element of row3 is1 \u2192 [1,1]. But output is [1,0]. Doesn't fit.\n\nSo this approach only works for Example2. Not helpful.\n\nAnother possible pattern: the output consists of the elements at positions (1,4) and (3,0) for the first row, and (4,0) and (4,4) for the second row.\n\nFor Example2:\n\n(1,4) is0, (3,0) is8 \u2192 [0,8].\n\n(4,0) is8, (4,4) is0 \u2192 [8,0]. Matches output.\n\nFor Example0:\n\n(1,4) is2, (3,0) is0 \u2192 [2,0].\n\n(4,0) is2, (4,4) is0 \u2192 [2,0]. Output is [2,2], [2,0]. Doesn't fit.\n\nExample1:\n\n(1,4) is1, (3,0) is1 \u2192 [1,1].\n\n(4,0) is1, (4,4) is1 \u2192 [1,1]. Output is [1,0], [1,1]. Doesn't fit.\n\nSo only works for Example2.\n\nAt this point, I'm really stuck. Let's try to find any other possible pattern.\n\nLooking at the test input:\n\nTest Input:\n[5,5,0,5,0]\n[0,5,0,0,5]\n[0,0,0,0,0]\n[5,5,0,5,5]\n[0,5,0,0,5]\n\nFollowing the pattern observed in the examples, perhaps the output is taking the first and last elements of certain rows. Let's assume that the pattern is to take the first and last elements of the second and fifth rows (rows1 and4).\n\nTest input rows1 and4:\n\nRow1: [0,5,0,0,5] \u2192 first0, last5 \u2192 [0,5].\n\nRow4: [0,5,0,0,5] \u2192 first0, last5 \u2192 [0,5].\n\nBut the training examples' outputs vary. For Example0, output is rows1 and4, which gives [2,2] and [2,0]. For Example1, it's rows0 and4. For Example2, it's some other rows.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the test input's output is rows0 and4.\n\nRow0:5,0 \u2192 [5,0].\n\nRow4:0,5 \u2192 [0,5].\n\nBut the training examples don't have this pattern.\n\nAnother possibility: the output is formed by the first and last elements of the rows that have exactly three occurrences of the number. For example, in Example0:\n\nRow0 has two 2s and three 0s. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the output is derived from the first and last elements of the rows that have the most occurrences of a number.\n\nIn Example0's row1: four 2s. So maybe that's selected.\n\nRow4 has two 2s and one 0.\n\nBut this approach is unclear.\n\nAlternatively, the output is the first and last elements of the two rows that have the highest sum. For Example0:\n\nRow1 sum: 2+2+0+2+2=8.\n\nRow4 sum:2+2+0+2+0=6.\n\nSo rows1 and3 (sum of row3 is 0+2+0+2+2=6). But output is rows1 and4. Doesn't fit.\n\nThis is taking too long. Let me try to find another approach.\n\nLooking at Example2's output: [0,8] and [8,0]. The input's row1 is [8,0,0,8,0], row4 is [8,0,0,8,0]. So row1's first and last are 8 and0. If we swap them, we get 0 and8 \u2192 [0,8]. Row4's first and last are8 and0 \u2192 swap to [0,8]. But the output's second row is [8,0]. So maybe one row is swapped and the other isn't. Not sure.\n\nBut in the test input, if we take rows1 and4:\n\nRow1:0 and5 \u2192 [0,5].\n\nRow4:0 and5 \u2192 [0,5].\n\nBut the training examples' outputs for Example0 and Example1 are different. So perhaps the test output would be [0,5] and [0,5]. But that doesn't match the training examples' style.\n\nAlternatively, considering that in Example2, the output rows are the reverse of the first and last elements of rows1 and4. So row1's reversed is [0,8], row4's reversed is [0,8]. But the output is [0,8] and [8,0]. So maybe row4's elements are not reversed.\n\nAlternatively, the first output row is row1's reversed first and last, and the second output row is row4's first and last.\n\nExample2's row1 reversed \u2192 [0,8], row4's first and last \u2192 [8,0]. Which matches the output.\n\nFor Example0:\n\nRow1 reversed \u2192 [2,2], row4's first and last \u2192 [2,0]. Which matches the output.\n\nExample1's row0 reversed \u2192 [0,1], row4's first and last \u2192 [1,1]. But the output is [1,0] and [1,1]. So row0's first and last are [1,0], not reversed. So that doesn't fit.\n\nBut this approach works for Example0 and Example2 but not Example1.\n\nThis inconsistency is confusing. Maybe there's another layer to the pattern.\n\nAnother observation: in all training examples, the output's first row has elements from different rows, and the second row from another. For Example2, first output row is row1's last and row3's first. But how?\n\nAlternatively, the first output row is the last element of row1 and the first element of row3. For Example2:\n\nRow1 last element:0, row3 first element:8 \u2192 [0,8].\n\nSecond output row is the first element of row4 (0) and last element of row4 (5) in the test input? Not sure.\n\nBut let's apply this to Example0:\n\nRow1 last element:2, row3 first element:0 \u2192 [2,0]. But output's first row is [2,2]. Doesn't fit.\n\nHmm.\n\nAt this point, I'm running out of ideas. Let's take a gamble based on the observation that in Example0 and Example1, the output rows are the first and last elements of rows1 and4 (Example0), and rows0 and4 (Example1). But in Example2, it's rows1 and4 with swapped elements. Maybe the pattern is to take the first and last elements of the second and fifth rows (rows1 and4) and reverse them for some reason.\n\nApplying this to the test input:\n\nTest input rows1 and4:\n\nRow1: [0,5,0,0,5] \u2192 first0, last5 \u2192 [0,5]. If reversed, [5,0].\n\nRow4: [0,5,0,0,5] \u2192 first0, last5 \u2192 [0,5]. If reversed, [5,0].\n\nBut the output needs to be two rows. However, the training examples have different numbers here. For Example2, the output for rows1 and4 would be [8,0] and [8,0], but the actual output is [0,8] and [8,0]. So maybe for rows1 and4, the first row is reversed, and the second row is not.\n\nIn Example2, rows1 and4 have [8,0] \u2192 reversed [0,8] as first output row. Second row is [8,0], which is row4's elements.\n\nTest input's rows1 and4 are [0,5] and [0,5]. Reversed, first output row would be [5,0], second row [0,5]. But looking at the training examples, Example0's output is rows1 and4 as [2,2] and [2,0]. No reversal there. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by the following:\n\nFor each of the two output rows, take the first element from the corresponding input row, and the last element from the mirror input row. For example, first output row is first element of row1 and last element of row3 (mirror of row1 across the middle). Second output row is first element of row3 and last element of row1.\n\nExample0's mirror of row1 (row1 is index1, mirror would be row3 (index3). So first element of row1 is2, last element of row3 is2 \u2192 [2,2]. Second output row: first of row3 is0, last of row1 is2 \u2192 [0,2]. But the actual output is [2,2], [2,0]. Doesn't fit.\n\nExample2's mirror of row1 (row1) is row3. First element of row1 is8, last of row3 is8 \u2192 [8,8]. Doesn't match output [0,8].\n\nHmm. Not working.\n\nAt this point, I think the pattern is that the output is the first and last elements of the second and fifth rows (rows1 and4) of the input. This works for Example0 and Example1, but not Example2. However, in Example2, the output is [0,8] and [8,0], which would be the reversed elements of rows1 and4's first and last. Maybe there's a reversal when the row index is odd or even. Or maybe the pattern is to take rows1 and4's first and last, but reverse them if the row index is even.\n\nBut I'm not sure. Given time constraints, I'll proceed with the assumption that the output is the first and last elements of rows1 and4 for the test input.\n\nTest input rows1 and4:\n\nRow1: [0,5,0,0,5] \u2192 first0, last5 \u2192 [0,5].\n\nRow4: [0,5,0,0,5] \u2192 first0, last5 \u2192 [0,5].\n\nBut the training examples don't have repeating outputs like this. For Example0, it's [2,2] and [2,0]. Example1 is [1,0] and [1,1]. Example2 is [0,8] and [8,0]. So the test input's output would be [0,5] and [0,5], but this doesn't align with the training examples' structure where outputs have different elements. Alternatively, maybe the test input's rows3 and4:\n\nRow3: [5,5,0,5,5] \u2192 first5, last5 \u2192 [5,5].\n\nRow4: [0,5,0,0,5] \u2192 first0, last5 \u2192 [0,5].\n\nBut then the output would be [5,5] and [0,5], which doesn't match any training example's pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is row0 and row3's first and last elements:\n\nTest input row0:5,0 \u2192 [5,0].\n\nRow3:5,5 \u2192 [5,5]. So output would be [5,0] and [5,5]. But the training examples don't have this either.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and the lack of a clear pattern, I'll have to make an educated guess. Based on Example0 and Example1, the output seems to take the first and last elements of rows1 and4. For Example2, perhaps there's an exception when rows1 and4 are the same, and the output is their reversed elements. Applying this to the test input:\n\nTest input rows1 and4 are both [0,5,0,0,5]. Their first and last elements are [0,5]. Reversed, this would be [5,0]. So the output could be:\n\n[0,5]\n\n[5,0]\n\nBut looking at the training examples, Example2's output is the reversed of the first and last elements of row1 and row4. So perhaps when rows1 and4 are the same, the output is their elements reversed. \n\nThus, the test output would be:\n\n[5,0]\n\n[0,5]\n\nBut the training examples don't show this. Example2's rows1 and4 are [8,0,0,8,0] and [8,0,0,8,0]. Their first and last elements are [8,0]. Reversed, this is [0,8]. So the output for Example2 is [0,8] and [8,0], which is the reversed of row1's elements and the original of row4's elements. This seems inconsistent.\n\nGiven the time I've invested and the need to provide an answer, I'll go with the assumption that the output for the test input is the first and last elements of rows1 and4:\n\n[0,5]\n\n[0,5]\n\nBut looking back at the training examples, Example1's rows0 and4 are used. So perhaps the correct pattern is to take the first and last elements of the first and last rows of the input (excluding the middle row). For the test input, that would be rows0 and4.\n\nTest input row0:5,0 \u2192 [5,0].\n\nRow4:0,5 \u2192 [0,5].\n\nSo the output would be:\n\n[5,0]\n\n[0,5]\n\nBut looking at Example1's output, rows0 and4 give [1,0] and [1,1]. So for the test input, if row0 is [5,5,0,5,0], first element5, last0 \u2192 [5,0]. Row4 is [0,5,0,0,5], first0, last5 \u2192 [0,5]. So output would be:\n\n[5,0]\n\n[0,5]\n\nBut the training examples' outputs have different formats. Example1's output is [1,0] (row0's first and last) and [1,1] (row4's first and last). So this would fit.\n\nBut the problem is that in Example0, the first output row is from row1, not row0. So this pattern isn't consistent across examples. Therefore, this approach may not be correct.\n\nGiven the confusion, I'll proceed with the answer that for the test input, the output is the first and last elements of rows1 and4, which would be [0,5] and [0,5]. But looking at the training examples, this would not fit. However, Example2's output uses reversed elements, so perhaps the test output is reversed as well. Hence, [5,0] and [0,5].\n\nBut the training example outputs for Example2 are [0,8] and [8,0], which are reversed. So applying this to the test input:\n\nRows1 and4's first and last elements are [0,5] and [0,5]. Reversed, they become [5,0] and [5,0], but Example2's output has two different rows. So maybe for the test input, the output is the reversed of row1's elements and the original of row4's elements. So:\n\n[5,0] and [0,5]. \n\nThis matches Example2's pattern. Thus, the final answer would be:\n\n[5, 0]\n\n[0, 5]",

        "cot_2": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. So, there are these input grids and corresponding output grids. I need to see how the input is transformed into the output for the training examples and then apply that to the test input.\n\nLooking at Example 0:\n\nInput is a 5x5 grid. The output is a 2x2 grid. So the first thing that comes to mind is that maybe the output is a reduction or some kind of summary of the input. Let's look closer.\n\nExample 0's input:\n\nRow 0: [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]\nRow 1: [2, 2, 0, 2, 2]\nRow 2: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\nRow 3: [0, 2, 0, 2, 2]\nRow 4: [2, 2, 0, 2, 0]\n\nOutput is:\n\n[2, 2]\n[2, 0]\n\nHmm. The output is two rows of two elements each. Maybe each element in the output corresponds to a quadrant or specific positions in the input. Let's see. The input is 5x5, which might be divided into four quadrants, but since 5 is odd, maybe the middle row and column are ignored. So, rows 0-1 and 3-4, columns 0-1 and 3-4. Let's check.\n\nIn Example 0's input:\n\nTop-left quadrant (rows 0-1, columns 0-1):\n0, 2\n2, 2\nThese elements. What's the output's first element? The first output row is [2,2]. Wait, maybe not quadrants. Alternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking elements from specific positions.\n\nWait, the output has two rows and two columns. Let's think of each element in the output being derived from certain cells in the input. Let's check the first output element of Example 0: 2. Where in the input is that 2 coming from?\n\nLooking at the input, maybe the first element of the output is the top-left corner (0,0)? But in Example 0's input, (0,0) is 0, but the output's first element is 2. So that's not it.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by looking at pairs of rows and columns. Let's think: in Example 0, the output is two rows. So maybe each row of the output is derived from two rows of the input. Let's check.\n\nFirst output row [2,2]. Let's see rows 0 and 1 of the input. Maybe combining them? Or maybe taking the maximum or sum of certain columns.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the first and last rows and columns. For example, the first and last elements of each row? Not sure.\n\nAnother approach: look at all examples to find a common pattern.\n\nExample 1's input:\n\n[1, 0, 0, 1, 0]\n[0, 1, 0, 0, 1]\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[1, 0, 0, 1, 0]\n[1, 1, 0, 0, 1]\n\nOutput is:\n\n[1,0]\n[1,1]\n\nExample 2's input:\n\n[8,8,0,0,8]\n[8,0,0,8,0]\n[0,0,0,0,0]\n[8,8,0,8,8]\n[8,0,0,8,0]\n\nOutput:\n\n[0,8]\n[8,0]\n\nLooking at the outputs, maybe each element in the output is taken from specific positions in the input. For example, in Example 0's output [2,2], [2,0], perhaps the first row of the output comes from row 1 and columns 0 and 4 (since 2 is present there). But not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the diagonal elements. For instance, in Example 0's output, first element is 2. Let's see the input. Row 0 has 0,2,0,0,2. Hmm. Maybe not.\n\nWait, perhaps the output is formed by taking the first and last elements of certain rows, ignoring the middle row (row 2 which is all zeros in example 0 and 1, but example 2 also has row 2 as zeros). So the input has a middle row that's all zeros. Maybe the output is derived from the other rows, excluding the middle.\n\nLooking at Example 0's input, rows 0,1,3,4. Columns 0,1,3,4 (since column 2 is middle). So perhaps the output is a 2x2 grid formed by the four corners of the original grid when the middle row and column are excluded. Wait, let's see.\n\nIn Example 0's input:\n\nIf we exclude the middle row (row 2) and middle column (column 2), we get a 4x4 grid. But how to turn that into 2x2? Maybe split into 2x2 blocks. Wait, 4 rows (0,1,3,4) and 4 columns (0,1,3,4). Then, perhaps group rows 0 and 1, and 3 and 4. Similarly columns. Then, for each 2x2 block, take some operation like sum, max, or maybe the first element.\n\nAlternatively, for each 2x2 block in the 4x4 grid, the output could be a single value. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking the elements from the first and last rows and columns, but arranged in a certain way.\n\nAnother thought: the output is 2x2. Let's check for each example, how the output relates to the input.\n\nTake Example 0:\n\nOutput:\nRow 0: [2,2]\nRow 1: [2,0]\n\nLooking at input rows:\n\nInput rows 0 and 4: [0,2,0,0,2] and [2,2,0,2,0]\n\nIf we take the first element of row 0 (0), and the first element of row 4 (2), maybe some operation. But the output starts with 2. Alternatively, maybe the sum of elements in certain positions.\n\nWait, maybe the output is constructed by taking pairs of elements from the input and applying a XOR or some operation. But with numbers higher than 1, like 8 in example 2, that's less likely.\n\nAnother angle: look at the positions in the input that correspond to the output's positions.\n\nFor example, the output is 2x2. Let's map each output cell to a pair in the input. Maybe:\n\nOutput cell (0,0) comes from input cell (0,0) and (4,4) or something.\n\nLooking at Example 0's output [2,2] and [2,0]. Let's see:\n\nIn Example 0:\n\nInput cell (0,0) is 0. Output cell (0,0) is 2. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's the sum of certain elements. For example, the first row of the output could be the sum of the first two rows of the input in some way.\n\nWait, let's take Example 0's input. The first output row is [2,2]. Let's look at rows 0 and 1 of the input. If we take the first two elements of row 0: [0,2], and row 1: [2,2]. Maybe adding them vertically: 0+2=2, 2+2=4. But output is [2,2]. Doesn't fit. Alternatively, max of those: max(0,2)=2, max(2,2)=2. That would give [2,2], which matches the first output row. Then the second output row [2,0] could be the max of rows 3 and 4. Let's check:\n\nRow 3: [0,2,0,2,2]\nRow 4: [2,2,0,2,0]\n\nTaking first two elements of row 3: 0,2. Row 4: 2,2. Max would be 2,2. But the output's second row is [2,0]. Hmm, that doesn't match. Wait, maybe the last two elements of rows 3 and 4. Row 3's last two elements are 2,2. Row 4's last two are 2,0. Max would be 2,2. But output's second row is [2,0]. Doesn't fit.\n\nAlternative approach: maybe the output is taking elements from the first and last rows, excluding the middle column. Let's see.\n\nExample 0's input first row: [0,2,0,0,2]. Excluding middle column (index 2), it's [0,2,0,2]. The output's first row is [2,2]. Hmm. Not sure.\n\nWait, in Example 0's output, the first element is 2. Let's see where 2's are in the input. The first 2 in input is at (0,1). Then in row 1, (0,0) is 2, (0,1) is 2. Maybe the output is taking elements from specific positions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the first and last element of the first and last rows (excluding middle). For example, in Example 0's first row (0), first element is 0, last element (index 4) is 2. Last row (4) first element is 2, last is 0. Then output would be [0,2] and [2,0], but the actual output is [2,2] and [2,0]. Doesn't fit.\n\nWait, perhaps the output is formed by taking the first and fourth elements (indices 0 and 3) of certain rows. Let's check.\n\nExample 0's input row 0: elements 0 and 3 are 0 and 0. Output row 0 is 2 and 2. Doesn't match. Hmm.\n\nLet me look at Example 1's input and output.\n\nInput rows:\n\n[1,0,0,1,0]\n[0,1,0,0,1]\n[0,0,0,0,0]\n[1,0,0,1,0]\n[1,1,0,0,1]\n\nOutput:\n\n[1,0]\n[1,1]\n\nLooking for where 1,0 and 1,1 come from. Let's see. For the first output row [1,0], maybe from rows 0 and 1. For the second output row [1,1], maybe from rows 3 and 4.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps the output is constructed by looking at pairs of rows and columns. For example, in the input, the middle row (all zeros) is ignored. Then, for the remaining four rows, maybe they're split into two pairs (rows 0-1 and 3-4), and each pair forms a row in the output. Then, for each pair of rows, take certain columns.\n\nFor Example 0:\n\nRows 0 and 1:\n\nRow 0: [0,2,0,0,2]\nRow 1: [2,2,0,2,2]\n\nIf we take columns 0 and 4 (the first and last) from each row, that would be for row 0: 0 and 2, row 1: 2 and 2. Then combine them somehow. But output's first row is [2,2]. Maybe take max of row 0 and 1 for each column. For column 0: max(0,2)=2. Column 4: max(2,2)=2. So [2,2], which matches the first output row. Then rows 3 and 4:\n\nRow 3: [0,2,0,2,2]\nRow 4: [2,2,0,2,0]\n\nMax of column 0: max(0,2)=2. Column 4: max(2,0)=2. But output's second row is [2,0]. Hmm, that doesn't fit. Alternatively, maybe taking columns 1 and 3? For rows 0 and 1:\n\nRow 0: index 1 is 2, index 3 is 0. Max is 2 and 2 (from row 1's indices 1 and 3: 2 and 2). Wait, row 1's index 1 is 2, index 3 is 2. Max would be 2 and 2, which matches the first output row.\n\nThen rows 3 and 4:\n\nRow3: index 1 is 2, index 3 is 2. Row4: index 1 is 2, index3 is2. Max would be 2 and 2, but the output's second row is [2,0]. So this isn't matching.\n\nWait, maybe it's not max. Maybe it's the sum modulo something. For example, in Example 0's first row of output, 2. Sum of rows 0 and 1 in column 0: 0 + 2 = 2. Column 4: 2 + 2=4. But 4 is not 2. So maybe modulo 3? 4 mod 3 is 1. Doesn't match. Hmm.\n\nAlternative approach: look for each output cell's value in the input. For Example 0's first output row [2,2]. Where are the 2's in the input? In row1, column0 and 1 are 2's. Maybe taking row1's first two elements. But the output's first row is [2,2], which matches row1's first two. Then the second output row [2,0]. Looking at rows3 and4. Row3's first two are 0 and2. Row4's first two are2 and2. Maybe taking row4's first element (2) and row3's second element (2)? But output is [2,0]. Not sure.\n\nWait, maybe the output is formed by the elements at positions (1,0) and (1,4) from the input. Let's check.\n\nExample 0's input row1: [2,2,0,2,2]. Columns 0 and4 are 2 and2. So output row1 would be [2,2], which matches the first output row. Then for the second output row [2,0], perhaps looking at row4's columns0 and4: 2 and0. So yes, that would give [2,0]. That fits. \n\nThen for Example 0, output rows are:\n\nRow0: [2,2] \u2192 input row1, columns0 and4.\n\nRow1: [2,0] \u2192 input row4, columns0 and4.\n\nBut let's check other examples.\n\nExample1's input:\n\nOutput is [1,0] and [1,1].\n\nIf we follow the same pattern, the first output row would be input row1's columns0 and4. Let's see row1: [0,1,0,0,1]. Columns0 is 0, column4 is1. So the first output row would be [0,1], but the actual output is [1,0]. Doesn't match.\n\nHmm, maybe that's not the pattern. Let me rethink.\n\nWait, in Example0's output, the first row is [2,2], which comes from input row1's first and last elements. But in Example1's output first row is [1,0]. Let's see input row1 of Example1: [0,1,0,0,1]. First element is 0, last is1. So if the output row is those, it would be [0,1], but actual output is [1,0]. Not matching. So that can't be.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps the output is formed by the elements from the second and fourth rows (indices1 and3) of the input, taking specific columns.\n\nIn Example0, output row0 is [2,2]. Input row1 is [2,2,0,2,2]. Maybe taking columns1 and3: 2 and2. So [2,2]. Then output row1 would be row3's columns1 and3: row3 is [0,2,0,2,2], columns1 is2, column3 is2. So [2,2], but actual output row1 is [2,0]. No match.\n\nAlternatively, columns0 and4. Row1's 0 and4 are 2 and2 \u2192 [2,2]. Row3's 0 and4 are0 and2 \u2192 [0,2], but output row1 is [2,0]. Not matching.\n\nHmm.\n\nWait, looking at Example2's output:\n\n[0,8]\n[8,0]\n\nTest input output might be [5,5] and [5,5] or something. Let's see.\n\nExample2's input:\n\nRow0: [8,8,0,0,8]\nRow1: [8,0,0,8,0]\nRow2: all 0\nRow3: [8,8,0,8,8]\nRow4: [8,0,0,8,0]\n\nOutput is [0,8] and [8,0].\n\nIf we take row1's columns0 and4: 8 and0 \u2192 [8,0]. But output row0 is [0,8]. Not matching.\n\nAlternatively, row0's column4 is8, row4's column0 is8. So combining those. For example, first output row is [row0 column4, row1 column4], which for Example0 would be row0 column4 is2, row1 column4 is2 \u2192 [2,2]. That matches Example0's first output row. Then the second output row is [row3 column4, row4 column4]. For Example0, row3 column4 is2, row4 column4 is0 \u2192 [2,0], which matches. \n\nTesting this hypothesis:\n\nExample0:\n\nOutput row0: [2 (row0 col4), 2 (row1 col4)] \u2192 [2,2]\n\nOutput row1: [2 (row3 col4), 0 (row4 col4)] \u2192 [2,0]. Correct.\n\nExample1:\n\nInput row0 col4 is0 (input row0: [1,0,0,1,0] \u2192 col4 is0)\n\nInput row1 col4 is1 (row1: [0,1,0,0,1] \u2192 col4 is1)\n\nSo output row0 would be [0,1], but actual output is [1,0]. Doesn't match. Hmm. So this idea is incorrect.\n\nWait, maybe the first output row is [row1 col0, row1 col4], which for Example0 would be [2,2], correct. For Example1, row1 col0 is0, col4 is1 \u2192 [0,1], but actual output is [1,0]. No.\n\nAlternative approach: looking at the outputs in relation to the input's non-middle rows (rows 0,1,3,4), maybe there's a pattern in the first and last elements of these rows. Let's see.\n\nIn Example0:\n\nRows 0: [0,2,0,0,2]\n\nRow1: [2,2,0,2,2]\n\nRow3: [0,2,0,2,2]\n\nRow4: [2,2,0,2,0]\n\nThe output is two rows, each with two elements.\n\nPerhaps the output's first row is row1's first and last elements (2 and2), and the output's second row is row4's first and last elements (2 and0). That would match Example0's output.\n\nFor Example1:\n\nRow1's first and last elements: 0 and1 \u2192 output row0 [0,1]. But actual output is [1,0]. Doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. Wait, Example1's output is [1,0] and [1,1]. Let's check row3 and row4.\n\nRow3: [1,0,0,1,0] \u2192 first is1, last is0. So if output row0 is row3's first and last:1 and0 \u2192 [1,0]. Then row4: [1,1,0,0,1] \u2192 first1, last1 \u2192 [1,1]. Which matches the output. So maybe the output rows are formed by taking rows3 and4's first and last elements.\n\nIn Example0:\n\nRow3: [0,2,0,2,2] \u2192 first0, last2. But output row0 is [2,2]. Doesn't fit.\n\nSo that's conflicting.\n\nWait, but in Example1, the output rows are [1,0] and [1,1], which correspond to row3's first and last (1,0) and row4's first and last (1,1). So for Example1, it works. For Example0, if the output was row3 and4's first and last, row3's first is0, last is2 \u2192 [0,2], row4's first2, last0 \u2192 [2,0]. But Example0's output is [2,2] and [2,0]. So the first row is not from row3 and4. Hmm. So maybe this pattern holds for Example1 but not others.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output rows are taken from row1 and row4. For Example0, row1's first and last are 2 and2 \u2192 [2,2], row4's first and last are2 and0 \u2192 [2,0]. Which matches Example0's output. For Example1, row1's first and last are0 and1 \u2192 [0,1], but output is [1,0]. Doesn't fit. So this is conflicting.\n\nWait, perhaps the output rows are taken from row1 and row3. Let's check.\n\nExample0: row1's first and last:2 and2 \u2192 [2,2], row3's first and last:0 and2 \u2192 [0,2]. But output is [2,2] and [2,0]. So no.\n\nAlternatively, row0 and row4. Example0's row0's first and last:0 and2 \u2192 [0,2], row4's first and last:2 and0 \u2192 [2,0]. But output is [2,2] and [2,0]. Not matching.\n\nThis is getting confusing. Let's try a different approach. Let's look at the positions of the output elements in each example and see if there's a spatial pattern.\n\nFor example, in Example0's output:\n\n[2,2]\n[2,0]\n\nLooking at the input's grid:\n\nRow0: 0,2,0,0,2\n\nRow1:2,2,0,2,2\n\nRow3:0,2,0,2,2\n\nRow4:2,2,0,2,0\n\nOutput rows 2,2 and 2,0.\n\nIf the output is a 2x2 grid, perhaps it's the four corners of the input's four corners when the middle row and column are removed. Wait, the input is 5x5. Removing the middle row and column gives a 4x4 grid. Then, take the corners of that 4x4? The 4x4 would be:\n\nRows 0,1,3,4 and columns 0,1,3,4.\n\nThe 4x4 grid for Example0 would be:\n\nRow0:0,2,0,2\n\nRow1:2,2,2,2\n\nRow3:0,2,2,2\n\nRow4:2,2,2,0\n\nThe corners of this 4x4 grid are (0,0) \u21920, (0,3) \u21922, (3,0)\u21922, (3,3)\u21920. Arranged as a 2x2 grid, this would be:\n\n[0,2]\n[2,0]\n\nBut the actual output is [2,2] and [2,0]. Doesn't match. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, the 4x4 grid's top-left 2x2 and bottom-right 2x2.\n\nWait, 4x4 grid can be divided into four 2x2 grids. Maybe the output is taking elements from the top-left and bottom-right of the 4x4.\n\nFor Example0's 4x4 grid:\n\nTop-left 2x2 (rows0-1, columns0-1):\n\n0,2\n\n2,2\n\nBottom-right 2x2 (rows2-3, columns2-3):\n\n2,2\n\n2,0\n\nWait, but rows2-3 would be rows3-4 of the original. Columns2-3 are columns3-4 of the original. So for Example0's 4x4 grid, bottom-right 2x2 would be:\n\nRow3 (original row3):0,2,2,2 \u2192 columns3-4 are2,2\n\nRow4 (original row4):2,2,2,0 \u2192 columns3-4 are2,0.\n\nSo the bottom-right 2x2 would be:\n\n[2,2]\n\n[2,0]\n\nWhich matches the output of Example0. And the top-left 2x2 would be:\n\n[0,2]\n\n[2,2]\n\nBut the output is [2,2] and [2,0]. So maybe the output is the bottom-right 2x2 of the 4x4 grid obtained by removing the middle row and column.\n\nChecking Example1:\n\nInput is:\n\nRow0: [1,0,0,1,0]\n\nRow1: [0,1,0,0,1]\n\nRow3: [1,0,0,1,0]\n\nRow4: [1,1,0,0,1]\n\nAfter removing middle row and column, the 4x4 grid is:\n\nRow0:1,0,1,0\n\nRow1:0,1,0,1\n\nRow3:1,0,1,0\n\nRow4:1,1,0,1\n\nWait, original rows are 0,1,3,4. Columns are 0,1,3,4.\n\nSo row0's columns0,1,3,4 are 1,0,1,0 \u2192 [1,0,1,0]\n\nRow1's columns0,1,3,4 are 0,1,0,1 \u2192 [0,1,0,1]\n\nRow3's columns0,1,3,4 are 1,0,1,0 \u2192 [1,0,1,0]\n\nRow4's columns0,1,3,4 are 1,1,0,1 \u2192 [1,1,0,1]\n\nThe 4x4 grid for Example1:\n\nRow0:1,0,1,0\n\nRow1:0,1,0,1\n\nRow3:1,0,1,0\n\nRow4:1,1,0,1\n\nThe bottom-right 2x2 of this 4x4 would be rows2-3 (original rows3-4) and columns2-3 (original columns3-4). Wait, rows3-4 are index 2 and3 in the 4x4 grid. Columns3-4 (original) are indexes 2 and3 in the 4x4.\n\nWait, the 4x4 grid has rows 0-3 (original rows0,1,3,4). Columns0-3 (original columns0,1,3,4). So rows2 and3 in the 4x4 grid are original rows3 and4. Columns2 and3 are original columns3 and4.\n\nSo the bottom-right 2x2 would be:\n\nRow2 (original row3):1,0 (columns2-3: 1 and0)\n\nRow3 (original row4):0,1 (columns2-3:0 and1)\n\nSo the bottom-right 2x2 is:\n\n[1,0]\n\n[0,1]\n\nBut Example1's output is [1,0] and [1,1]. So this doesn't match. So this theory is incorrect.\n\nHmm. Maybe the output is the top-right 2x2 of the 4x4 grid. For Example0's 4x4 grid:\n\nRow0:0,2,0,2\n\nRow1:2,2,2,2\n\nRow3:0,2,2,2\n\nRow4:2,2,2,0\n\nTop-right 2x2 (rows0-1, columns2-3):\n\n0,2\n\n2,2\n\nWhich would be [0,2; 2,2]. Not matching Example0's output.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's the middle 2x2 of the 4x4 grid. For Example0's 4x4:\n\nColumns1-2 (original columns1 and3) and rows1-2 (original rows1 and3). So columns1-2 of the 4x4 are 2,0 (row0), 2,2 (row1), 2,2 (row3), 2,2 (row4). Not sure.\n\nAnother approach: look at the output elements and see if they appear in specific positions of the input.\n\nExample0's output first row [2,2]. Looking at the input, row1 is [2,2,0,2,2]. So the first two elements are 2,2. Maybe the first output row is the first two elements of row1, and the second output row is the first two elements of row4. Let's check:\n\nExample0's row1: first two elements 2,2 \u2192 [2,2]. Row4: first two 2,2 \u2192 but output's second row is [2,0]. Doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, row1's last two elements (2,2) and row4's last two elements (2,0). That would give [2,2] and [2,0], which matches. So output is last two elements of row1 and row4.\n\nChecking for Example1:\n\nRow1's last two elements (0,1) \u2192 output row0 is [1,0]. Doesn't match. Hmm.\n\nExample1's output is [1,0] and [1,1]. If the output is the first two elements of row3 and row4:\n\nRow3: [1,0,0,1,0] \u2192 first two 1,0 \u2192 matches first output row [1,0]. Row4: [1,1,0,0,1] \u2192 first two 1,1 \u2192 matches second output row [1,1]. That fits!\n\nExample0's output:\n\nRow3: [0,2,0,2,2] \u2192 first two 0,2 \u2192 but output's first row is [2,2]. So this doesn't fit. So this pattern works for Example1 but not Example0.\n\nHmm. This is tricky.\n\nAnother idea: look for the output elements as the sum of certain elements in the input. For example, each output element is the sum of two diagonally opposite elements in the input. \n\nExample0's output first row [2,2]. Maybe (row0 col4 + row4 col0) =2+2=4 \u2192 but output is 2. Doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, the product. 2*2=4. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, the minimum or maximum. For Example0's output first row, max of row0 and row4 in certain positions.\n\nWait, let's think differently. Maybe the output is formed by taking elements from certain positions in the input, but the positions are mirrored or follow a certain pattern.\n\nLooking at the test input:\n\n[5,5,0,5,0]\n[0,5,0,0,5]\n[0,0,0,0,0]\n[5,5,0,5,5]\n[0,5,0,0,5]\n\nFollowing the pattern from the examples, the output should be a 2x2 grid. Let's see what the expected output would be. If we can find the pattern for the test input, maybe it can help reverse-engineer the training examples.\n\nAssuming the output is two rows, each with two elements. Let's think of possible candidates.\n\nLooking at the test input, rows0,1,3,4 (excluding the middle row2).\n\nRow0:5,5,0,5,0 \u2192 columns0 and4:5 and0.\n\nRow1:0,5,0,0,5 \u2192 columns0 and4:0 and5.\n\nRow3:5,5,0,5,5 \u2192 columns0 and4:5 and5.\n\nRow4:0,5,0,0,5 \u2192 columns0 and4:0 and5.\n\nIf the output is formed by taking rows1 and4's columns0 and4:\n\nRow1:0 and5 \u2192 [0,5]\n\nRow4:0 and5 \u2192 [0,5]\n\nBut the example outputs don't follow this pattern. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, if the output is row3 and row4's columns0 and4:\n\nRow3:5 and5 \u2192 [5,5]\n\nRow4:0 and5 \u2192 [0,5]\n\nBut this is just a guess.\n\nAnother approach: let's look for a pattern that works across all examples.\n\nExample0:\n\nOutput:\n\n[2,2]\n\n[2,0]\n\nExample1:\n\n[1,0]\n\n[1,1]\n\nExample2:\n\n[0,8]\n\n[8,0]\n\nLooking at these, perhaps the output is formed by taking the second and fourth rows of the input (indices1 and3) and columns0 and4.\n\nFor Example0:\n\nRow1: [2,2,0,2,2] \u2192 columns0 and4 \u2192 [2,2].\n\nRow3: [0,2,0,2,2] \u2192 columns0 and4 \u2192 [0,2]. But output's second row is [2,0]. Doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe rows1 and4.\n\nExample0:\n\nRow1: columns0 and4 \u2192 [2,2]\n\nRow4: columns0 and4 \u2192 [2,0]. Which matches the output.\n\nExample1:\n\nRow1: columns0 and4 \u2192 [0,1]\n\nRow4: columns0 and4 \u2192 [1,1]. But the output is [1,0] and [1,1]. So first row is not matching.\n\nHmm. So this works for Example0 and the test input (if we apply it), but not for Example1.\n\nExample2:\n\nRow1: [8,0,0,8,0] \u2192 columns0 and4 \u2192 [8,0]\n\nRow4: [8,0,0,8,0] \u2192 columns0 and4 \u2192 [8,0]. But the output is [0,8] and [8,0]. Doesn't fit.\n\nAnother observation: the output for Example2 is [0,8] and [8,0]. Let's look at the input rows3 and4.\n\nRow3: [8,8,0,8,8] \u2192 columns0 and4 are8 and8.\n\nRow4: [8,0,0,8,0] \u2192 columns0 and4 are8 and0.\n\nIf the output rows are row3 and row4's columns0 and4, then [8,8] and [8,0], but the output is [0,8] and [8,0]. Doesn't match. \n\nWait, maybe it's reversed. Like for Example2's first output row is columns4 and0 of row3. 8 and8 \u2192 [8,8]. But output is [0,8]. Not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is taking columns0 and4 of rows3 and4, but in reverse order. For Example2:\n\nRow3: columns0 and4 \u21928 and8. Reverse \u21928,8. Not matching output [0,8].\n\nHmm. This is really challenging. Let's try to find another pattern.\n\nLooking at the outputs for all examples:\n\nExample0:\n\nOutput rows:\n\n[2,2] \u2192 sum 4\n\n[2,0] \u2192 sum 2\n\nExample1:\n\n[1,0] \u2192 sum 1\n\n[1,1] \u2192 sum 2\n\nExample2:\n\n[0,8] \u2192 sum8\n\n[8,0] \u2192 sum8\n\nNot sure if sums are relevant.\n\nLooking for a pattern where the output is derived from the elements adjacent to the middle row or column.\n\nIn Example0, the middle row is all zeros. The output's first row is 2,2. Maybe these are the elements directly above and below the middle row in certain columns. For example, column0 has 0 (row0) and 2 (row1) above middle, and 0 (row3) and2 (row4) below. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the middle column (column2) is all zeros. So the elements to the left and right of the middle column in certain rows.\n\nFor Example0, row1 has elements left of middle (column1) as2 and right of middle (column3) as2. So [2,2], which matches first output row. Row4 has column1 as2 and column3 as2 \u2192 [2,2], but output's second row is [2,0]. Doesn't fit.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternative approach: The output is a 2x2 matrix where each element is the value from the input matrix at positions (i*2, j*2) where i and j are 0 and1. For example, in a 5x5 matrix, this would pick positions (0,0), (0,2), (2,0), (2,2), but that doesn't fit. Or maybe (0,0), (0,4), (4,0), (4,4). For Example0:\n\n(0,0) \u21920, (0,4)\u21922, (4,0)\u21922, (4,4)\u21920. Arranged as:\n\n0 2\n\n2 0\n\nBut Example0's output is [2,2] and [2,0]. Doesn't match.\n\nAnother idea: the output is formed by the elements that are in the same position as the non-zero elements in the middle row and column. But the middle row and column are all zeros. So maybe not.\n\nWait, perhaps the output is the first and last non-zero elements in each non-middle row. For Example0, row0:0,2,0,0,2 \u2192 first non-zero is2 (position1), last non-zero is2 (position4). So [2,2], which matches the first output row. Row1's first non-zero is2 (position0), last is2 (position4) \u2192 [2,2]. But output's first row is [2,2], which could be from row0 or row1. Then row3's first non-zero is2 (position1), last is2 (position4) \u2192 [2,2]. Row4's first non-zero is2 (position0), last is0 (position4) \u2192 [2,0]. So output rows are row0 and row4's first and last non-zero elements? For Example0, that would give [2,2] and [2,0], which matches. \n\nLet's check Example1:\n\nRow0:1,0,0,1,0 \u2192 first non-zero is1 (position0), last is1 (position3) \u2192 [1,1]. But output's first row is [1,0]. Doesn't match. Hmm.\n\nExample1's output is [1,0] and [1,1]. Looking at row3:1,0,0,1,0 \u2192 first non-zero1, last1 \u2192 [1,1]. Row4:1,1,0,0,1 \u2192 first1, last1 \u2192 [1,1]. But output has [1,0], which doesn't fit. So this pattern doesn't hold.\n\nAnother angle: maybe the output is derived from the corners of the input matrix. The 5x5 input has four corners: (0,0), (0,4), (4,0), (4,4). These would form a 2x2 matrix if arranged as:\n\n[ (0,0), (0,4) ]\n\n[ (4,0), (4,4) ]\n\nFor Example0, these are 0,2,2,0 \u2192 [[0,2],[2,0]]. But Example0's output is [[2,2],[2,0]]. So that's not it. \n\nBut the output for Example0 is different. So perhaps it's not the corners.\n\nAnother observation: in all examples, the middle row (row2) is all zeros. The output for each example is a 2x2 grid. So maybe the output is formed by some operation on the rows excluding the middle row. Like, for each of the remaining four rows, take certain columns and combine them.\n\nFor Example0, the four non-middle rows are rows0,1,3,4. If we take two of these rows and combine them into the output. For example, row1 and row4. Row1's columns0 and4 are2 and2 \u2192 [2,2]. Row4's columns0 and4 are2 and0 \u2192 [2,0]. Which matches Example0's output. \n\nExample1's output is [1,0] and [1,1]. Looking at non-middle rows: rows0,1,3,4. Let's see:\n\nRow3's columns0 and4:1 and0 \u2192 [1,0]. Row4's columns0 and4:1 and1 \u2192 [1,1]. Which matches Example1's output. \n\nExample2's output is [0,8] and [8,0]. Looking at non-middle rows:\n\nRow3:8,8,0,8,8 \u2192 columns0 and4 \u21928 and8. Row4:8,0,0,8,0 \u2192 columns0 and8 \u21928 and0. So output would be [8,8] and [8,0]. But the actual output is [0,8] and [8,0]. Hmm. This doesn't fit. \n\nWait, but maybe it's rows1 and4. Example2's row1:8,0,0,8,0 \u2192 columns0 and4 \u21928 and0. Row4: columns0 and4 \u21928 and0. Output would be [8,0] and [8,0]. Actual output is [0,8] and [8,0]. Doesn't match. \n\nHmm, but Example2's output is [0,8] and [8,0]. How can this happen?\n\nLooking at Example2's input rows:\n\nRow3: [8,8,0,8,8] \u2192 columns0 and4 are8 and8.\n\nRow0: [8,8,0,0,8] \u2192 columns0 and4 are8 and8.\n\nRow1: [8,0,0,8,0] \u2192 columns0 and4 are8 and0.\n\nRow4: [8,0,0,8,0] \u2192 columns0 and4 are8 and0.\n\nBut the output is [0,8] and [8,0]. Where can these come from? \n\nAh, wait, maybe it's rows0 and3 and columns1 and3. For Example2:\n\nRow0: columns1 and3 \u21928 and0.\n\nRow3: columns1 and3 \u21928 and8.\n\nBut output is [0,8] and [8,0]. Doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, rows1 and3's columns1 and3. Row1's columns1 and3:0 and8. Row3's columns1 and3:8 and8. \u2192 [0,8], [8,8]. Not matching.\n\nAlternatively, rows0 and4's columns1 and3. Row0's columns1:8, column3:0. Row4's columns1:5? Row4 is [8,0,0,8,0] \u2192 columns1 is0, column3 is8. So rows0 and4's columns1 and3 would be 8,0 from row0 and 0,8 from row4. So [8,0] and [0,8]. Which is [8,0], [0,8]. But the output is [0,8] and [8,0]. So reversed.\n\nHmm. This is perplexing. \n\nBut according to the previous pattern for Example0 and Example1, the output is rows3 and4's columns0 and4. For Example0:\n\nRow3:0 and2 \u2192 no. Wait, previously in Example1, it's row3 and row4's columns0 and4. Example1's row3: columns0 is1, column4 is0. So [1,0]. Row4: columns0 and4 are1 and1 \u2192 [1,1]. Which matches the output. So maybe the pattern is: output row0 is row3's columns0 and4, output row1 is row4's columns0 and4.\n\nApplying this to Example0:\n\nRow3's columns0 and4 \u21920 and2 \u2192 [0,2]. But output row0 is [2,2]. Doesn't fit. So this doesn't hold.\n\nExample2's output row0 is [0,8], which would correspond to row3's columns0 and4 \u21928 and8. Doesn't match.\n\nHmm. This is really challenging. Let's try to find a pattern that works for all examples.\n\nLooking back:\n\nExample0's output is derived from rows1 and4's columns0 and4.\n\nExample1's output is derived from rows3 and4's columns0 and4.\n\nExample2's output is derived from rows0 and4's columns4 and0 (reversed).\n\nBut that seems inconsistent. \n\nWait, perhaps the output is formed by taking the columns0 and4 of the first and last non-middle rows. For Example0, non-middle rows are rows0,1,3,4. First is row0, last is row4. Columns0 and4 of row0:0 and2. Columns0 and4 of row4:2 and0. So output would be [0,2] and [2,0]. But actual output is [2,2] and [2,0]. Doesn't fit.\n\nAnother idea: the output is the sum of the first and last rows (excluding middle) for columns0 and4. For Example0:\n\nRow0:0,2,0,0,2 \u2192 columns0 and4:0 and2.\n\nRow4:2,2,0,2,0 \u2192 columns0 and4:2 and0.\n\nSum:0+2=2, 2+0=2 \u2192 [2,2]. Then sum of row1 and row3: row1's columns0 and4:2 and2. Row3's columns0 and4:0 and2. Sum:2+0=2, 2+2=4 \u2192 [2,4]. Doesn't match.\n\nThis is not leading anywhere. Maybe I need to consider that the output is formed by taking the elements from the input where the original element is followed by the same number in the next row. \n\nAlternatively, think of the output as a transformation based on frequency or occurrence. But the examples don't show clear patterns in frequencies.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the elements that appear in the same position in the input after shifting rows.\n\nAlternatively, think of the input as layers, and the output is the top and bottom layers in certain positions.\n\nAnother possibility: the output is the elements at positions (1,0), (1,4), (3,0), (3,4) of the input. Let's check:\n\nExample0:\n\n(1,0)=2, (1,4)=2 \u2192 first output row [2,2].\n\n(3,0)=0, (3,4)=2 \u2192 second output row [0,2]. But Example0's output second row is [2,0]. Doesn't fit.\n\nExample1:\n\n(1,0)=0, (1,4)=1 \u2192 [0,1].\n\n(3,0)=1, (3,4)=0 \u2192 [1,0]. But output is [1,0] and [1,1]. So the second row would be [1,0], but actual output's second row is [1,1]. No.\n\nExample2:\n\n(1,0)=8, (1,4)=0 \u2192 [8,0].\n\n(3,0)=8, (3,4)=8 \u2192 [8,8]. But output is [0,8] and [8,0]. Doesn't match.\n\nHmm. \n\nAt this point, perhaps the pattern is that the output is formed by the elements in the third and fourth rows (original rows3 and4) of the input's columns0 and4. \n\nExample0:\n\nRow3:0,2,0,2,2 \u2192 columns0=0,4=2 \u2192 [0,2].\n\nRow4:2,2,0,2,0 \u2192 columns0=2,4=0 \u2192 [2,0].\n\nBut the output is [2,2] and [2,0]. So this doesn't fit. \n\nExample1:\n\nRow3:1,0,0,1,0 \u2192 columns0=1,4=0 \u2192 [1,0].\n\nRow4:1,1,0,0,1 \u2192 columns0=1,4=1 \u2192 [1,1].\n\nWhich matches Example1's output. \n\nExample2:\n\nRow3:8,8,0,8,8 \u2192 columns0=8,4=8 \u2192 [8,8].\n\nRow4:8,0,0,8,0 \u2192 columns0=8,4=0 \u2192 [8,0].\n\nBut the output is [0,8] and [8,0]. Doesn't fit. \n\nSo this works for Example1 but not others.\n\nThis is really challenging. Let's try to look for a pattern that works for all examples.\n\nLooking at Example0's output: [2,2] and [2,0].\n\nLooking at the input, the 2's are in row1 and row4. Maybe the output rows are the first and last elements of the rows that have the most occurrences of a certain number.\n\nRow1 has four 2's. Row4 has three 2's. Maybe the first output row is row1's first and last elements:2 and2. Second row is row4's first and last:2 and0. Which matches.\n\nExample1's output: [1,0] and [1,1]. The rows with the most 1's are row4 with three 1's. So first output row is row3's first and last elements:1 and0. Second row is row4's first and last:1 and1. Which matches.\n\nExample2's output: [0,8] and [8,0]. The rows with the most 8's are row0 and row3. Row0 has three 8's, row3 has four 8's. So first output row is row0's first and last:8 and8. But output is [0,8]. Doesn't fit. \n\nHmm. This works for some examples but not all.\n\nAnother possible pattern: the output is formed by the elements in the second and fourth rows (original rows1 and3) of the input, taking columns0 and4. \n\nExample0:\n\nRow1:2 and2 \u2192 [2,2].\n\nRow3:0 and2 \u2192 [0,2]. Output is [2,2], [2,0]. Doesn't fit.\n\nExample1:\n\nRow1:0 and1 \u2192 [0,1].\n\nRow3:1 and0 \u2192 [1,0]. Output is [1,0], [1,1]. First row matches, second row doesn't.\n\nExample2:\n\nRow1:8 and0 \u2192 [8,0].\n\nRow3:8 and8 \u2192 [8,8]. Output is [0,8], [8,0]. Doesn't match.\n\nNot helpful.\n\nAt this point, I think the correct pattern is that the output is formed by taking the fourth and fifth rows (original rows3 and4) of the input, and for each of those rows, taking the first and last elements (columns0 and4).\n\nFor Example0:\n\nRow3:0,2,0,2,2 \u2192 columns0 and4 are0 and2 \u2192 [0,2].\n\nRow4:2,2,0,2,0 \u2192 columns0 and4 are2 and0 \u2192 [2,0].\n\nBut Example0's output is [2,2] and [2,0], which doesn't fit. \n\nWait, but maybe the output is reversed. So for row3, take columns4 and0. Row3: 2 and0 \u2192 [2,0]. Row4:0 and2 \u2192 [0,2]. But the output is [2,2], [2,0]. Doesn't match.\n\nHmm.\n\nAfter struggling for a while, I think I need to consider that the pattern is based on the elements in the input where the sum of the row and column indices is even or odd. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the first and last elements of the first and last non-middle rows. \n\nFor Example0, first non-middle row is row0:0,2,0,0,2 \u2192 first 0, last 2. Last non-middle row is row4:2,2,0,2,0 \u2192 first2, last0. So output would be [0,2], [2,0]. But Example0's output is [2,2], [2,0]. Doesn't fit.\n\nBut the output's first row is [2,2]. Where else could that come from?\n\nLooking back at Example0's input, perhaps the output is formed by the elements at positions (1,0), (1,1), (4,0), (4,1). \n\nRow1: 2,2 \u2192 [2,2].\n\nRow4:2,2 \u2192 [2,2]. But the output's second row is [2,0]. Doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, the elements at (1,0), (1,4), (4,0), (4,4). \n\nRow1:2,2 \u2192 [2,2].\n\nRow4:2,0 \u2192 [2,0]. Which matches Example0's output.\n\nExample1:\n\nRow1's (0,4) are0 and1 \u2192 [0,1].\n\nRow4's (0,4) are1 and1 \u2192 [1,1]. But output is [1,0], [1,1]. So this doesn't fit.\n\nExample1's output first row is [1,0]. How to get that?\n\nRow3's (0,4) are1 and0 \u2192 [1,0]. Which matches.\n\nSo for Example0, output rows are row1 and row4's columns0 and4. For Example1, output rows are row3 and row4's columns0 and4. For Example2, output rows are row0 and row4's columns4 and0.\n\nThis seems inconsistent. Maybe the pattern is that the output rows are the rows immediately before and after the middle row (rows1 and3) and the last row (row4), but I can't see a clear rule.\n\nAlternatively, the output is formed by the rows that have the same first and last elements. \n\nExample0's row1:2,2 \u2192 first and last are2 and2. So output row is [2,2]. Row4:2 and0 \u2192 not same. But output's second row is [2,0]. Doesn't fit.\n\nExample1's row3:1 and0 \u2192 not same. But output's first row is [1,0]. \n\nNot helpful.\n\nAfter extensive analysis, I think the pattern is that each output row corresponds to the first and last elements of the rows that have the maximum number of non-zero elements. \n\nExample0:\n\nRow1 has four 2's (non-zero). Row4 has three 2's. So row1 is max. Its first and last are2 and2 \u2192 [2,2]. Then row4 is next, first and last are2 and0 \u2192 [2,0]. Which matches.\n\nExample1:\n\nRow4 has three 1's (max). Its first and last are1 and1 \u2192 [1,1]. Then row3 has two 1's. First and last are1 and0 \u2192 [1,0]. Which matches the output.\n\nExample2:\n\nRow3 has four 8's (max). First and last are8 and8 \u2192 [8,8]. Row0 has three 8's. First and last are8 and8 \u2192 [8,8]. But output is [0,8] and [8,0]. Doesn't fit. \n\nHmm, but Example2's output is [0,8] and [8,0]. This pattern doesn't hold.\n\nGiven that the time is limited, I'll proceed to make a guess based on the observations that for Examples0 and1, the output rows are formed by the first and last elements of the row with the maximum non-zero elements and the row after that.\n\nApplying this to the test input:\n\nTest input's non-middle rows are:\n\nRow0:5,5,0,5,0 \u2192 non-zeros:5,5,5 \u2192 count 3.\n\nRow1:0,5,0,0,5 \u2192 non-zeros:5,5 \u2192 count 2.\n\nRow3:5,5,0,5,5 \u2192 non-zeros:5,5,5,5 \u2192 count4.\n\nRow4:0,5,0,0,5 \u2192 non-zeros:5,5 \u2192 count2.\n\nSo the row with maximum non-zero is row3 with count4. Its first and last elements are5 and5 \u2192 [5,5]. Next is row0 with count3. First and last are5 and0 \u2192 [5,0]. So output would be:\n\n[5,5]\n\n[5,0]\n\nBut looking at the training examples, perhaps the order is the row after the maximum. Or maybe the two rows with the highest counts. \n\nIn the test input, row3 has highest count4, row0 has next. So output rows would be row3 and row0's first and last. So [5,5] and [5,0]. But according to the examples, the outputs sometimes have different orders. For example, Example2's output is [0,8] and [8,0], which might correspond to row0's last and row4's first. So perhaps there's a different pattern.\n\nAlternatively, based on Example0 and Example1's pattern where the first output row is the row after the middle (row1) and the last row (row4), perhaps the test input's output is rows1 and4's first and last elements.\n\nTest input row1:0,5,0,0,5 \u2192 first0, last5 \u2192 [0,5].\n\nRow4:0,5,0,0,5 \u2192 first0, last5 \u2192 [0,5].\n\nBut the example outputs for training examples have different structures.\n\nAlternatively, based on Example1's pattern where the output rows are row3 and4's first and last, the test input's row3 and4:\n\nRow3:5,5,0,5,5 \u2192 first5, last5 \u2192 [5,5].\n\nRow4:0,5,0,0,5 \u2192 first0, last5 \u2192 [0,5].\n\nBut the example outputs are not following this.\n\nAlternatively, the output is row0 and row3's first and last elements.\n\nRow0:5 and0 \u2192 [5,0].\n\nRow3:5 and5 \u2192 [5,5].\n\nSo output:\n\n[5,0]\n\n[5,5]\n\nBut the training examples don't show this pattern.\n\nAt this point, I'm stuck. But given that the test input is:\n\n[5,5,0,5,0]\n\n[0,5,0,0,5]\n\n[0,0,0,0,0]\n\n[5,5,0,5,5]\n\n[0,5,0,0,5]\n\nLooking for a pattern similar to the training examples, perhaps the output is:\n\n[5,5]\n\n[5,0]\n\nBecause in Example0, the output's first row is from row1's first and last (2,2), and the second row from row4's (2,0). Applying this to test input:\n\nRow1:0,5,0,0,5 \u2192 first0, last5 \u2192 [0,5]. But the output in Example0 was from row1's first and last (2,2). So for test input, this would be [0,5]. Doesn't seem to match the expected pattern.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is row3 and row4's first and last elements. For test input:\n\nRow3:5,5,0,5,5 \u2192 first5, last5 \u2192 [5,5].\n\nRow4:0,5,0,0,5 \u2192 first0, last5 \u2192 [0,5].\n\nBut the output should be similar to the training examples. For example, Example2's output is [0,8] and [8,0], which is row0's last and row4's first. \n\nTest input's row0's last is0, row4's first is0. So [0,0]. Doesn't fit.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and the lack of clear pattern, I'll make a educated guess based on the examples. The output seems to involve the first and last elements of certain rows, possibly the rows with the highest non-zero counts. For the test input, the row with the highest non-zero count is row3 (four 5's) and row0 (three 5's). So their first and last elements are:\n\nRow3:5 and5 \u2192 [5,5].\n\nRow0:5 and0 \u2192 [5,0].\n\nThus, the output would be:\n\n[5,5]\n\n[5,0]\n\nBut looking at the training examples, especially Example2's output, which is [0,8] and [8,0], which would correspond to row0's last (8) and row4's first (8). But row0's first is8 and last is8, but output is [0,8]. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, the output is formed by taking the last element of the first row and the first element of the last row. For Example0, row1's last is2, row4's first is2 \u2192 [2,2]. Then row3's last is2, row4's first is2 \u2192 [2,2]. Doesn't fit.\n\nAnother possibility: the output is the elements from the input's row1 and row4's columns0 and4. For test input:\n\nRow1:0 and5 \u2192 [0,5].\n\nRow4:0 and5 \u2192 [0,5].\n\nBut the training examples don't show this.\n\nAlternatively, considering the symmetry in Example2's output ([0,8] and [8,0]), perhaps the test input's output is [5,0] and [0,5], but that's a guess.\n\nBut looking at the training examples, each output has elements that are present in the input. For the test input, possible outputs could be [5,5] and [5,0], similar to Example0's output. Alternatively, [5,0] and [0,5].\n\nBut without a clear pattern, this is challenging. Based on the training examples, especially Example0 and Example1, where the output's first row comes from the row after the middle (row1) and the output's second row comes from the last row (row4), I'll apply that pattern to the test input.\n\nTest input's row1:0,5,0,0,5 \u2192 columns0 and4 are0 and5 \u2192 [0,5].\n\nRow4:0,5,0,0,5 \u2192 columns0 and4 are0 and5 \u2192 [0,5].\n\nBut this gives two rows of [0,5], which doesn't match any of the training example patterns.\n\nAlternatively, row3 and row4's columns0 and4.\n\nRow3:5,5,0,5,5 \u2192 columns0 and4 are5 and5 \u2192 [5,5].\n\nRow4:0 and5 \u2192 [0,5].\n\nWhich would give:\n\n[5,5]\n\n[0,5]\n\nBut this doesn't match any pattern.\n\nGiven the time I've invested and the need to provide an answer, I'll conclude that the pattern is to take the first and last elements of row3 and row4. For Example0, that gives [0,2] and [2,0], but Example0's output is [2,2] and [2,0]. Doesn't fit. \n\nAlternatively, the output is the first and last elements of row1 and row4.\n\nExample0: row1's first and last \u21922,2 \u2192 [2,2]. row4's \u21922,0 \u2192 [2,0]. Correct.\n\nExample1: row1's \u21920,1 \u2192 [0,1]. row4's \u21921,1 \u2192 [1,1]. But Example1's output is [1,0] and [1,1]. So doesn't fit.\n\nBut Example1's output's first row is [1,0], which matches row3's first and last (1,0). So perhaps the pattern is that the output rows are row3 and row4's first and last elements.\n\nFor the test input:\n\nRow3:5,5,0,5,5 \u2192 first5, last5 \u2192 [5,5].\n\nRow4:0,5,0,0,5 \u2192 first0, last5 \u2192 [0,5].\n\nBut Example0's output would require row3 and row4's elements: [0,2] and [2,0], but the actual output is [2,2] and [2,0]. So this doesn't fit.\n\nGiven the time I have, I'll proceed with the answer that matches the pattern of taking rows3 and4's columns0 and4 for the output. For the test input, this would be:\n\nRow3:5 and5 \u2192 [5,5]\n\nRow4:0 and5 \u2192 [0,5]\n\nBut in the training examples, Example2's output is [0,8] and [8,0], which would correspond to row0 and row4's columns4 and0. So perhaps for even-numbered examples, the pattern changes. But this is unclear.\n\nAlternatively, considering that in Example0 and Example1, the output rows are the columns0 and4 of row1 and row4, and row3 and row4 respectively, I think the pattern might be taking columns0 and4 of the rows that are mirror images around the middle row. For example, row1 and row3 (mirror of each other in a 5x5 grid). \n\nExample0: row1 and row3's columns0 and4:\n\nRow1:2,2 \u2192 [2,2]\n\nRow3:0,2 \u2192 [0,2]. But output is [2,2] and [2,0]. No.\n\nAnother approach: given the time I've spent and the need to submit an answer, I'll make an educated guess based on the test input's structure resembling Example0 and Example2. The test input's row3 has [5,5,0,5,5] and row0 has [5,5,0,5,0]. The output might be [5,5] and [5,0], similar to Example0's [2,2] and [2,0], and Example2's [0,8] and [8,0].\n\nTherefore, the final answer would be:\n\n[5,5]\n[5,0]"
