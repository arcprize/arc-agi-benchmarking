        "cot_1": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. So, looking at the training examples, each input is a 3x3 grid, and the output is a 6x3 grid. Wait, no, actually, the input is three rows, each with three elements, and the output is six rows. Let me check the examples again.\n\nIn Example 0, the input is three rows:\n[1,1,0]\n[1,1,1]\n[0,0,0]\n\nThe output is six rows:\nFirst the original three, then the original three again but reversed in order. Wait, looking at the output for Example 0:\n\nOriginal rows:\n[1,1,0]\n[1,1,1]\n[0,0,0]\n\nThen followed by:\n[0,0,0] (third row)\n[1,1,1] (second row)\n[1,1,0] (first row)\n\nSo the output is the original input followed by the reverse of the input rows. But wait, the output has the original three rows, then the reversed three rows. Let's check Example 1.\n\nInput for Example 1:\n[0,0,0]\n[1,0,1]\n[1,1,0]\n\nOutput is:\nOriginal three rows, then the reversed rows. Let's see:\n\nOriginal:\n0,0,0\n1,0,1\n1,1,0\n\nReversed rows (reverse the order of the rows):\n1,1,0\n1,0,1\n0,0,0\n\nBut the output is the original followed by reversed. So output has 6 rows, which is 3 original + 3 reversed.\n\nYes, that matches. Example 2's input is three rows:\n\n[0,0,0]\n[0,0,1]\n[0,0,1]\n\nOutput is original followed by reversed. The reversed rows would be the third row, then second, then first. So the output is:\n\nOriginal:\n0,0,0\n0,0,1\n0,0,1\n\nReversed rows:\n0,0,1\n0,0,1\n0,0,0\n\nWhich matches the output given.\n\nSo the pattern seems to be that the output is the original input followed by the reverse of the input rows. So the output is doubling the number of rows by appending the reverse of the rows. So for the test input:\n\nTest Input:\n[0,0,0]\n[0,0,1]\n[1,0,0]\n\nOriginal three rows. Then reversed rows would be:\n\nThird row first: [1,0,0], then [0,0,1], then [0,0,0].\n\nSo the output should be the original three followed by those three reversed. Let's check the example outputs again to confirm.\n\nYes, in Example 0, the output is original + reversed. So applying that here, the test input's output would be:\n\nOriginal rows:\n[0,0,0]\n[0,0,1]\n[1,0,0]\n\nThen reversed rows:\n[1,0,0]\n[0,0,1]\n[0,0,0]\n\nSo combining them, the output would have six rows as the input followed by the reversed input rows. Let me double-check with the examples to ensure there's no other pattern. For instance, maybe each row is reversed? But in Example 0, the first row of the input is [1,1,0], and in the reversed part, it's the same row. So no, it's the order of the rows that's reversed, not the elements within each row.\n\nYes, that's the case. So the answer should be the original three rows followed by the reversed order of those three rows.",

        "cot_2": "Okay, let's look at the training examples to figure out the pattern. So, each example has an input matrix and an output matrix. Let's start by analyzing the first example.\n\nIn Example 0, the input is a 3x3 matrix:\n\n[1, 1, 0]\n[1, 1, 1]\n[0, 0, 0]\n\nThe output is:\n\n[1, 1, 0]\n[1, 1, 1]\n[0, 0, 0]\n[0, 0, 0]\n[1, 1, 1]\n[1, 1, 0]\n\nHmm, so the output is the original input followed by a mirrored version. Wait, looking at the output, the first three rows are the original input. Then the next three rows look like the reverse of the original. Let me check. Original input rows are row 0, 1, 2. The output adds rows 2, 1, 0 again. So for example 0, the original matrix is 3 rows, and the output is 6 rows: the original followed by the original in reverse order. So the output is the input concatenated with its reverse.\n\nLet me check the second example. Example 1's input is:\n\n[0, 0, 0]\n[1, 0, 1]\n[1, 1, 0]\n\nThe output is:\n\n[0, 0, 0]\n[1, 0, 1]\n[1, 1, 0]\n[1, 1, 0]\n[1, 0, 1]\n[0, 0, 0]\n\nYes, same pattern. The first three rows are the input, then the next three are the input rows in reverse order. So row 2, row 1, row 0 of the input are added. So input rows 0,1,2 become output rows 0,1,2, followed by 2,1,0. So the output is input + reversed input rows.\n\nExample 2's input:\n\n[0, 0, 0]\n[0, 0, 1]\n[0, 0, 1]\n\nOutput:\n\n[0, 0, 0]\n[0, 0, 1]\n[0, 0, 1]\n[0, 0, 1]\n[0, 0, 1]\n[0, 0, 0]\n\nSame pattern. Original three rows, then reversed. So rows 0,1,2 become rows 0,1,2, then 2,1,0. Wait, the original input here has two identical rows (rows 1 and 2 are same). So the reversed part would be row 2,1,0. Which are [0,0,1], [0,0,1], [0,0,0]. So the output has the original and then the reversed rows.\n\nSo the general pattern is: take the input matrix (which is 3 rows) and append the reverse of the input rows. So the output is the input followed by the reverse of the input rows. So total of 6 rows.\n\nNow, the test input is:\n\n[0, 0, 0]\n[0, 0, 1]\n[1, 0, 0]\n\nSo the input has three rows. Following the pattern, the output should be the original three rows followed by the same three rows in reverse order. Let's reverse the order of the rows:\n\nOriginal rows in order: row0 [0,0,0], row1 [0,0,1], row2 [1,0,0]\n\nReversed rows would be row2, row1, row0. So the reversed rows are:\n\n[1,0,0]\n[0,0,1]\n[0,0,0]\n\nTherefore, the output should be the original three rows followed by these three reversed rows. Let's write them out:\n\nOriginal:\n[0,0,0]\n[0,0,1]\n[1,0,0]\n\nReversed:\n[1,0,0]\n[0,0,1]\n[0,0,0]\n\nSo combining them, the output is six rows:\n\n[0,0,0]\n[0,0,1]\n[1,0,0]\n[1,0,0]\n[0,0,1]\n[0,0,0]\n\nYes, that matches the pattern observed in the training examples. Let me check the other examples again to confirm. For example, in example 0, the input rows are [1,1,0], [1,1,1], [0,0,0]. Reversed rows would be [0,0,0], [1,1,1], [1,1,0], which is exactly what's in the output. So yes, the pattern holds. Therefore, applying this to the test input gives the six rows as described."
