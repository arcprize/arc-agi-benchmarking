        "cot_1": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. So, looking at the training examples. Each input is a 3x3 grid, and the output is a 3x6 grid. So the output is double the width of the input. Hmm, right. So the transformation probably involves mirroring or reflecting each row in some way.\n\nLet's start with Example 0. The input is:\n\n[0,7,0]\n[0,0,7]\n[0,7,7]\n\nThe output is:\n\n[0,7,0,0,7,0]\n[0,0,7,7,0,0]\n[0,7,7,7,7,0]\n\nLooking at each row in the output. The first row of the input is [0,7,0], and the output is [0,7,0, 0,7,0]. Wait, that looks like the original row followed by a reversed version but with some change. Wait, original is [0,7,0], reversed would be [0,7,0], so appending that would make it the same. But in the output, it's [0,7,0, 0,7,0]. Hmm, maybe it's the original followed by the reverse of the original, but then why does the second part start with 0 again? Let me check another example.\n\nExample 1 input:\n\n[0,0,0]\n[0,7,7]\n[0,0,0]\n\nOutput:\n\n[0,0,0,0,0,0]\n[0,7,7,7,7,0]\n[0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nSo the middle row in input is [0,7,7], and the output row is [0,7,7,7,7,0]. So here, the original row is [0,7,7], and the output is that followed by [7,7,0], but reversed? Wait, [0,7,7] reversed is [7,7,0]. So if you take the original row and append its reverse, then the output for the middle row would be [0,7,7,7,7,0]. Wait, that's exactly what's happening here. Because 0,7,7 followed by 7,7,0 (reverse of the original) gives 0,7,7,7,7,0. But wait, the original is three elements, reversed is three elements. So combining them would make six elements. Let's check other examples.\n\nIn Example 0's first row: input is [0,7,0], reversed is [0,7,0]. So appending gives [0,7,0,0,7,0], which matches the output. But then the second row input is [0,0,7], reversed would be [7,0,0]. So appending gives [0,0,7,7,0,0], which is exactly the output. Third row input [0,7,7], reversed is [7,7,0], so combined gives [0,7,7,7,7,0], which matches the output.\n\nWait, so the pattern is that each row in the output is the original row concatenated with the reverse of the original row. Let's check Example 2.\n\nExample 2 input:\n\n[0,0,0]\n[7,0,0]\n[0,0,0]\n\nOutput middle row is [7,0,0,0,0,7]. Original row is [7,0,0], reversed is [0,0,7]. Wait, original reversed would be [0,0,7]? Wait, original is [7,0,0], reversed would be [0,0,7]. So appending gives [7,0,0,0,0,7], which matches the output.\n\nYes! So the pattern seems to be that each row in the output is the original row followed by the reversed version of that same row. Let me confirm with all examples.\n\nFor Example 1's middle row: [0,7,7] reversed is [7,7,0], so combined gives [0,7,7,7,7,0], which is the output. Correct.\n\nSo the transformation is: take each row from the input, reverse it, and append it to the original row. Then, the output is the original row followed by its reverse. That makes the output rows twice as long as the input rows, which aligns with the examples.\n\nNow, applying this to the test input:\n\nTest Input:\n\n[7,7,0]\n[0,7,0]\n[0,0,7]\n\nSo for each row:\n\nFirst row: [7,7,0]. Reverse is [0,7,7]. So combined gives [7,7,0,0,7,7].\n\nSecond row: [0,7,0]. Reverse is [0,7,0]. So combined is [0,7,0,0,7,0].\n\nThird row: [0,0,7]. Reverse is [7,0,0]. Combined is [0,0,7,7,0,0].\n\nWait, but looking at the training examples, let me check Example 0's third row. Input [0,7,7], reversed is [7,7,0], so combined as [0,7,7,7,7,0]. Wait, in that case, the reversed row is [7,7,0], but when you append, the third row's output is [0,7,7,7,7,0]. Wait, that's [0,7,7] followed by [7,7,0]. But the reversed of the original is [7,7,0], so yes.\n\nWait, but the test input's third row is [0,0,7], reversed would be [7,0,0]. So appending gives [0,0,7,7,0,0]. But let me check the training examples again. For example, in Example 2, the middle row is [7,0,0], reversed is [0,0,7], so the output is [7,0,0,0,0,7]. Wait, that's the original followed by the reversed. But in Example 0's third row, original is [0,7,7], reversed is [7,7,0], so combined is [0,7,7,7,7,0]. So yes, the pattern holds.\n\nSo applying this to the test input:\n\nRow 1: [7,7,0] + [0,7,7] \u2192 [7,7,0,0,7,7]\n\nRow 2: [0,7,0] + [0,7,0] \u2192 [0,7,0,0,7,0]\n\nRow 3: [0,0,7] + [7,0,0] \u2192 [0,0,7,7,0,0]\n\nWait, but looking at the training examples' outputs, for example, in Example 0, the third row's output ends with 0. Let me check if there's another step. Wait, perhaps there's an additional step. Let's look again.\n\nWait, in Example 0's first input row is [0,7,0], reversed is [0,7,0], so combined gives [0,7,0,0,7,0], which is correct.\n\nBut in Example 0's third row input [0,7,7], reversed is [7,7,0], so combined as [0,7,7,7,7,0], which is correct.\n\nBut wait in the output of Example 0, the third row is [0,7,7,7,7,0]. So the original [0,7,7] and reversed [7,7,0], but in the output it's [0,7,7,7,7,0]. Wait, that's not exactly the original plus reversed. The original plus reversed would be [0,7,7,7,7,0]? Let's see. Original is [0,7,7], reversed is [7,7,0]. So combining them would be [0,7,7,7,7,0]. Yes, exactly.\n\nSo the process is to take each row, reverse it, then append. So for each row in input, output is original + reversed.\n\nTherefore, applying that to the test input:\n\nTest input rows:\n\nRow 0: [7,7,0] \u2192 reversed is [0,7,7] \u2192 combined \u2192 [7,7,0,0,7,7]\n\nRow 1: [0,7,0] \u2192 reversed is [0,7,0] \u2192 combined \u2192 [0,7,0,0,7,0]\n\nRow 2: [0,0,7] \u2192 reversed is [7,0,0] \u2192 combined \u2192 [0,0,7,7,0,0]\n\nWait, but looking at the examples, in Example 2's output, the middle row is [7,0,0,0,0,7], which is the original [7,0,0] followed by reversed [0,0,7]. So that's exactly the same process.\n\nSo the test input's output should be:\n\n[7,7,0,0,7,7]\n[0,7,0,0,7,0]\n[0,0,7,7,0,0]\n\nBut let me check if that's correct. But wait, in the training examples, sometimes there's a change. Let me check Example 1's middle row input [0,7,7]. Reversed is [7,7,0], so combined gives [0,7,7,7,7,0], which is the output. Correct.\n\nSo applying this to the test input, the output should be each row concatenated with its reversed version. But wait, the test input's first row [7,7,0] reversed is [0,7,7], so the output row is [7,7,0,0,7,7]. The second row [0,7,0] reversed is [0,7,0], so output is [0,7,0,0,7,0]. Third row [0,0,7] reversed is [7,0,0], so output [0,0,7,7,0,0].\n\nSo the final output would be:\n\n[7,7,0,0,7,7]\n[0,7,0,0,7,0]\n[0,0,7,7,0,0]\n\nBut wait, let me look again. Wait, in the training examples, the outputs for the rows sometimes have 7s in the middle. Let me check if there's another pattern. For instance, in Example 1's middle row output: [0,7,7,7,7,0]. So the original is [0,7,7], reversed is [7,7,0], but when concatenated, it's [0,7,7,7,7,0]. Wait, that's combining the original [0,7,7] and reversed [7,7,0], but the output row is [0,7,7,7,7,0]. Wait, that's not exactly the concatenation. Because [0,7,7] concatenated with [7,7,0] would be [0,7,7,7,7,0]. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo the pattern is indeed to reverse each row and append it to the original. So the test input's output should be as I thought.",

        "cot_2": "Okay, let's see. I need to figure out the pattern here. Let's look at the training examples first.\n\nStarting with Example 0. The input is a 3x3 matrix:\n\nInput:\n[0,7,0]\n[0,0,7]\n[0,7,7]\n\nOutput is a 3x6 matrix:\n\n[0,7,0,0,7,0]\n[0,0,7,7,0,0]\n[0,7,7,7,7,0]\n\nHmm. The output rows are double the length of the input. So each row in the input becomes twice as long in the output. How are the new elements added?\n\nLooking at the first row of input: [0,7,0]. The output row is [0,7,0,0,7,0]. Wait, that looks like the original row followed by a reversed version of the row but with some modification. Let's check:\n\nOriginal: 0,7,0. Then mirrored part is 0,7,0 reversed is 0,7,0. Wait, but the output is 0,7,0 followed by 0,7,0. That's the same as original and then original again? But wait, maybe it's a mirror. Let's see. The input is 3 elements, the output is 6. So perhaps each row is mirrored and appended, but with some modification. Let's take the first row of Example 0's output. The input row is [0,7,0]. The output is [0,7,0,0,7,0]. Wait, that's the original row followed by the reverse of the original row. Wait, reverse of [0,7,0] is [0,7,0], same as original. So maybe for this case, it's just duplicated. But that doesn't explain other examples.\n\nLooking at Example 1's input:\n\nInput:\n[0,0,0]\n[0,7,7]\n[0,0,0]\n\nOutput:\n[0,0,0,0,0,0]\n[0,7,7,7,7,0]\n[0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nSo the middle row in input is [0,7,7], output is [0,7,7,7,7,0]. So here, the original is [0,7,7], then the mirrored part is [7,7,0] reversed? Wait, the second part after the original is [7,7,0] reversed would be 0,7,7. But the output after the original is 7,7,0. Wait, that's not matching. Wait, the output row is [0,7,7,7,7,0]. So it's the original row [0,7,7] followed by [7,7,0]. How did that happen? Wait, perhaps the mirroring is done by taking the reverse of the original row and then adding it to the end, but with some modification where 7s are kept and 0s are added. Alternatively, maybe the output is the original row concatenated with its reverse, but replacing the middle elements. Wait, let's see. The input row is [0,7,7]. Reverse would be [7,7,0]. Then concatenating original and reversed gives [0,7,7,7,7,0]. Oh! That's exactly the output. So for the middle row, input is [0,7,7], reversed is [7,7,0], concatenating gives [0,7,7,7,7,0]. Wait, no, because the original is 3 elements and reversed is another 3, so together 6. So that works. Let's check if this pattern holds for other examples.\n\nExample 0's first row: [0,7,0]. Reversed is [0,7,0]. So concatenated gives [0,7,0,0,7,0], which matches the output. The second row input [0,0,7], reversed is [7,0,0]. Concatenating gives [0,0,7,7,0,0], which matches the output. Third row input [0,7,7], reversed is [7,7,0], concatenated gives [0,7,7,7,7,0], which matches the output. So yes, the pattern here seems to be that each row is concatenated with its reversed version.\n\nWait, but then let's check Example 2. Input is:\n\n[0,0,0]\n[7,0,0]\n[0,0,0]\n\nOutput is:\n\n[0,0,0,0,0,0]\n[7,0,0,0,0,7]\n[0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nMiddle row input is [7,0,0]. Reverse is [0,0,7]. Concatenating gives [7,0,0,0,0,7], which matches the output. So yes, this seems to hold.\n\nSo the pattern is: For each row in the input, reverse the row and concatenate it to the original row to form the output row. That would double the length from 3 to 6. Let's test this with all examples.\n\nIn Example 0, each row's reversed is appended. For example, third row input [0,7,7] reversed is [7,7,0], but wait, reversed would be [7,7,0]. Wait, the input row is [0,7,7], reversed would be [7,7,0], right? So original plus reversed gives [0,7,7,7,7,0]. But the output for that row is [0,7,7,7,7,0], which matches. So yes.\n\nSo the rule is: For each row, take the original row and append its reversed version. That gives the output row.\n\nBut wait, let's check Example 1's middle row again. Input row is [0,7,7]. Reversed is [7,7,0]. So original plus reversed gives [0,7,7,7,7,0], which is exactly the output. Correct.\n\nExample 2's middle row input [7,0,0], reversed is [0,0,7], concatenated gives [7,0,0,0,0,7], which matches the output. So yes, the pattern is to reverse each row and append it.\n\nSo for the test input:\n\nTest Input:\n[7,7,0]\n[0,7,0]\n[0,0,7]\n\nEach row needs to be concatenated with its reversed version.\n\nLet's process each row.\n\nFirst row: [7,7,0]. Reverse is [0,7,7]. So concatenated: [7,7,0,0,7,7].\n\nSecond row: [0,7,0]. Reverse is [0,7,0]. So concatenated: [0,7,0,0,7,0].\n\nThird row: [0,0,7]. Reverse is [7,0,0]. So concatenated: [0,0,7,7,0,0].\n\nBut wait, let's check the training examples. For example, in Example 0, the output of the first row was [0,7,0,0,7,0], which is original followed by reversed. So same here.\n\nBut wait, in the test input's third row, [0,0,7] reversed would be [7,0,0], so concatenated gives [0,0,7,7,0,0]. So the third row's output would be that.\n\nSo the final output should be:\n\n[7,7,0,0,7,7]\n[0,7,0,0,7,0]\n[0,0,7,7,0,0]\n\nBut let me check if that's correct according to the pattern. Yes, each row is original + reversed.\n\nBut wait, in the training examples, all outputs start and end with the same numbers. For example, in Example 0's first row, output starts with 0 and ends with 0, which matches the original's first and last elements. Because when you reverse the original, the first element of reversed is the last of original, and the last of reversed is the first of original. Wait, no. Wait, the original is [0,7,0], reversed is [0,7,0]. So the concatenated row starts with 0 and ends with 0. Similarly, in Example 1's middle row, the reversed part starts with 7 (original last element) and ends with 0 (original first element). Wait, the original is [0,7,7], reversed is [7,7,0]. So the concatenated row is [0,7,7,7,7,0], which starts with 0 and ends with 0. So the first element of the output row is the original's first element, and the last element is the original's last element. So the output rows always start and end with the same elements as the original rows.\n\nSo in the test input's first row [7,7,0], reversed is [0,7,7], so concatenated becomes [7,7,0,0,7,7]. Starts with 7 and ends with 7, which matches the original's first (7) and last (0). Wait, wait no. The original first element is 7, last is 0. The reversed row is [0,7,7], so concatenated row's last element is 7. So the output row starts with 7 and ends with 7, but the original starts with 7 and ends with 0. Hmm, that seems different from the training examples.\n\nWait, looking back at Example 0's third row input [0,7,7]. The output is [0,7,7,7,7,0]. Original starts with 0 and ends with 7. Reversed is [7,7,0]. So concatenated is [0,7,7,7,7,0]. The output ends with 0, which is the original's first element. So in that case, the output starts with original's first and ends with original's first. Wait, that's a conflict. Wait, original is [0,7,7]. Reversed is [7,7,0]. So concatenated is original + reversed: [0,7,7,7,7,0]. So the output starts with 0 and ends with 0. But the original's last element is 7. So this suggests that the output's last element is the original's first element. So the pattern is not just appending reversed, but perhaps there's a modification. Wait, this is conflicting.\n\nWait, let me re-examine Example 0's first input row:\n\nInput: [0,7,0] \u2192 reversed is [0,7,0]. Concatenated: [0,7,0,0,7,0]. So starts and ends with 0.\n\nOriginal starts with 0, ends with 0. So output ends with 0. That's same as original.\n\nExample 0's second row input: [0,0,7]. Reversed is [7,0,0]. Concatenated: [0,0,7,7,0,0]. Starts with 0, ends with 0. Original starts with 0, ends with 7. So output ends with 0 again, which is original's first element.\n\nThird row input: [0,7,7]. Reversed [7,7,0]. Concatenated [0,7,7,7,7,0]. Starts with 0, ends with 0. Original starts with 0, ends with 7. So the output ends with the original's first element, not the original's last.\n\nHmm, this suggests that the reversed row is being added, but perhaps there's a step where the reversed row is adjusted. Wait, but how?\n\nWait, looking at the outputs, the first element of the output row is the original's first element, and the last element of the output row is the original's first element. Because when you append the reversed row, the reversed row's last element is the original's first. So concatenated, the last element is reversed row's last, which is original's first. So the output rows always start and end with the original's first element. That's a pattern.\n\nSo for the test input's first row [7,7,0], reversed is [0,7,7]. Concatenated gives [7,7,0,0,7,7]. So starts with 7 (original first) and ends with 7 (original first). Which matches the pattern.\n\nBut wait, in the training example 0's third row input was [0,7,7], reversed is [7,7,0]. Concatenated [0,7,7,7,7,0], which starts and ends with 0. Original first element is 0, so the output starts and ends with 0.\n\nIn example 2's middle row input [7,0,0], reversed [0,0,7]. Concatenated [7,0,0,0,0,7]. Starts with 7, ends with 7. Original first element is 7. So yes, the pattern holds.\n\nSo the rule is: For each row, take the original row and append its reversed version. The output row will have the same first element as the original row and end with the original row's first element. So that's the pattern.\n\nSo applying this to the test input:\n\nTest Input:\n\nRow 1: [7,7,0] \u2192 reversed [0,7,7] \u2192 concatenated [7,7,0,0,7,7]\n\nRow 2: [0,7,0] \u2192 reversed [0,7,0] \u2192 concatenated [0,7,0,0,7,0]\n\nRow 3: [0,0,7] \u2192 reversed [7,0,0] \u2192 concatenated [0,0,7,7,0,0]\n\nSo the output should be:\n\n[7,7,0,0,7,7]\n[0,7,0,0,7,0]\n[0,0,7,7,0,0]\n\nBut let's check if this matches the training examples' format. For example, in Example 0, the first row's output is [0,7,0,0,7,0], which is original [0,7,0] followed by reversed [0,7,0]. So same here. So yes, this seems correct."
