        "cot_1": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. So, looking at the training examples, each input is a 3x3 grid, and the output is another 3x3 grid. I need to see how the input rows are transformed into the output rows.\n\nLet me start with Example 0. The input is:\n\n[2, 2, 1]\n[1, 5, 1]\n[5, 2, 2]\n\nOutput is:\n\n[2, 1, 5]\n[2, 5, 2]\n[1, 1, 2]\n\nHmm. Let's see if each row is being transformed in some way. Maybe the rows are rotated or reversed. Let's check the first input row [2,2,1] becomes [2,1,5]. Wait, that's not a reverse. Wait, the output's first row is 2,1,5. The input's first column is 2,1,5. Oh, maybe it's a transpose of the matrix? Let me check. The transpose would swap rows and columns. Original matrix columns are:\n\nFirst column: 2,1,5 \u2192 becomes first row [2,1,5]. Yes, that's the first output row. Second column of input is 2,5,2 \u2192 which becomes the second row [2,5,2]. Third column is 1,1,2 \u2192 third output row [1,1,2]. So in Example 0, the output is the transpose of the input matrix. But wait, transpose of a matrix is when rows become columns. Let me confirm.\n\nOriginal matrix:\n\nRow 0: 2,2,1\nRow 1: 1,5,1\nRow 2:5,2,2\n\nTranspose would make columns into rows:\n\nColumn 0: 2,1,5 \u2192 row 0 of output \u2192 which matches.\n\nColumn 1: 2,5,2 \u2192 row 1 of output.\n\nColumn 2: 1,1,2 \u2192 row 2 of output.\n\nYes! So the output here is the transpose of the input matrix. Let's check another example to see if this holds.\n\nTake Example 1:\n\nInput:\n\n[2,2,5]\n[6,2,2]\n[5,5,5]\n\nTransposed would be:\n\nColumns of input:\n\nCol0: 2,6,5 \u2192 row0: [2,6,5]\n\nCol1:2,2,5 \u2192 row1: [2,2,5]\n\nCol2:5,2,5 \u2192 row2: [5,2,5]\n\nWhich matches the output. So example 1's output is the transpose. Similarly, Example 2:\n\nInput:\n\n[9,9,5]\n[5,5,8]\n[5,8,9]\n\nTransposed columns are:\n\nCol0:9,5,5 \u2192 row0: [9,5,5]\n\nCol1:9,5,8 \u2192 row1: [9,5,8]\n\nCol2:5,8,9 \u2192 row2: [5,8,9]\n\nWhich matches the output. So for Example 2, it's also a transpose.\n\nThen Example 3:\n\nInput:\n\n[2,6,6]\n[2,1,1]\n[2,6,2]\n\nTransposed columns:\n\nCol0:2,2,2 \u2192 row0: [2,2,2]\n\nCol1:6,1,6 \u2192 row1: [6,1,6]\n\nCol2:6,1,2 \u2192 row2: [6,1,2]\n\nWhich matches the output. So all examples show that the output is the transpose of the input matrix.\n\nSo the pattern here is transposing the matrix. The test input is:\n\n[9,3,4]\n[9,4,4]\n[9,3,4]\n\nTransposing this matrix would take each column and make them rows.\n\nLet's list the columns of the test input:\n\nColumn 0: 9,9,9 \u2192 becomes row0: [9,9,9]\n\nColumn 1:3,4,3 \u2192 row1: [3,4,3]\n\nColumn 2:4,4,4 \u2192 row2: [4,4,4]\n\nWait, but let's check each column.\n\nOriginal input rows:\n\nRow0:9,3,4\n\nRow1:9,4,4\n\nRow2:9,3,4\n\nSo columns are:\n\nFirst column: 9 (from row0), 9 (row1), 9 (row2) \u2192 [9,9,9]\n\nSecond column:3 (row0),4 (row1),3 (row2) \u2192 [3,4,3]\n\nThird column:4 (row0),4 (row1),4 (row2) \u2192 [4,4,4]\n\nSo the output should be:\n\n[9,9,9]\n\n[3,4,3]\n\n[4,4,4]\n\nWait, but the training examples have outputs that are transposed. So according to that, the test input's transpose would be the three rows as above. Let me confirm the test input. Let me write the input as a matrix:\n\nInput rows:\n\nRow0: [9,3,4]\n\nRow1: [9,4,4]\n\nRow2: [9,3,4]\n\nTransposing this would result in columns as rows:\n\nFirst transposed row: 9,9,9\n\nSecond transposed row:3,4,3\n\nThird transposed row:4,4,4\n\nSo the output should be those three rows as lists. So the answer would be:\n\n[9,9,9]\n\n[9,4,3]\n\n[4,3,4]? Wait, no. Wait the columns are:\n\nFirst column (original rows' first element):\n\nRow0:9\n\nRow1:9\n\nRow2:9 \u2192 so first row of output is [9,9,9]\n\nSecond column:3,4,3 \u2192 so output row is [3,4,3]\n\nThird column:4,4,4 \u2192 output row is [4,4,4]\n\nSo the output should be:\n\n[9,9,9]\n\n[3,4,3]\n\n[4,4,4]\n\nBut let me check the training examples again to ensure there isn't any additional transformation. For example, in Example 0, the transpose is exactly the output. So if the pattern is transpose, then the test input's output is as above.\n\nWait, but looking at the test input, the output would be:\n\nFirst row:9,9,9\n\nSecond row:3,4,3\n\nThird row:4,4,4\n\nYes. So the answer is those three arrays.",

        "cot_2": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. So, the task is to look at the input matrices and their corresponding outputs and find out what transformation is being applied. Then apply that to the test input.\n\nLooking at Example 0:\n\nInput:\n[2, 2, 1]\n[1, 5, 1]\n[5, 2, 2]\n\nOutput:\n[2, 1, 5]\n[2, 5, 2]\n[1, 1, 2]\n\nHmm. Let me see how the input rows become the output rows. Wait, maybe each row is being rotated or reversed? Let's check. \n\nOriginal first row: [2,2,1]. Output first row is [2,1,5]. Wait, that doesn't look like a simple reverse. Wait, maybe it's a cyclic shift. Let's see. If we take the first row of the input as [2,2,1], maybe the output's first row is the first element of each row from the input. Let me check:\n\nLooking at the input columns:\nFirst column: 2,1,5\nSecond column: 2,5,2\nThird column: 1,1,2\n\nWait, the output rows are exactly the columns of the input. But the output in Example 0's first row is [2,1,5], which is the first column of the input. Then the second output row is [2,5,2], which is the second column. Third output row is [1,1,2], the third column. But wait, the output is arranged as rows here. So maybe the output is the transpose of the input matrix. The transpose of a matrix is when rows become columns and columns become rows. Let's check.\n\nOriginal input matrix for Example 0:\nRow 0: 2,2,1\nRow 1:1,5,1\nRow 2:5,2,2\n\nTranspose would be columns as rows:\nColumn 0: 2,1,5 \u2192 row 0 of output: [2,1,5]\nColumn 1:2,5,2 \u2192 row 1 of output: [2,5,2]\nColumn 2:1,1,2 \u2192 row 2 of output: [1,1,2]\n\nYes, that matches the output. So the transformation is taking the transpose of the matrix. But wait, let's check the other examples to confirm.\n\nExample 1:\n\nInput:\n[2, 2, 5]\n[6, 2, 2]\n[5, 5, 5]\n\nTranspose would be columns:\n\nColumn 0:2,6,5 \u2192 output row 0: [2,6,5]\nColumn 1:2,2,5 \u2192 output row 1: [2,2,5]\nColumn 2:5,2,5 \u2192 output row 2: [5,2,5]\n\nWhich matches the output. So Example 1's output is the transpose. So the pattern seems to be transposing the matrix. But wait, let's check Example 2.\n\nExample 2 Input:\n[9,9,5]\n[5,5,8]\n[5,8,9]\n\nTranspose would be:\n\nColumn 0:9,5,5 \u2192 output row 0: [9,5,5]\nColumn 1:9,5,8 \u2192 output row 1: [9,5,8]\nColumn 2:5,8,9 \u2192 output row 2: [5,8,9]\n\nWhich matches the output. So that's correct. Then Example 3.\n\nInput:\n[2,6,6]\n[2,1,1]\n[2,6,2]\n\nTranspose would be columns:\n\nColumn 0:2,2,2 \u2192 output row 0: [2,2,2]\nColumn 1:6,1,6 \u2192 output row 1: [6,1,6]\nColumn 2:6,1,2 \u2192 output row 2: [6,1,2]\n\nBut the actual output for Example 3 is:\n\n[2, 2, 2]\n[6, 1, 6]\n[6, 1, 2]\n\nWhich matches. So all examples are transposes. So the transformation is to transpose the matrix. So the test input's output should be the transpose of the input matrix.\n\nTest Input:\n[9,3,4]\n[9,4,4]\n[9,3,4]\n\nTransposing this matrix:\n\nOriginal columns:\n\nColumn 0:9,9,9 \u2192 output row 0: [9,9,9]\nColumn 1:3,4,3 \u2192 output row 1: [3,4,3]\nColumn 2:4,4,4 \u2192 output row 2: [4,4,4]\n\nSo the output should be:\n\n[9,9,9]\n[3,4,3]\n[4,4,4]\n\nWait, but let me check again. Each column becomes a row in the output. Let's take the input rows as rows of the original matrix.\n\nOriginal matrix is 3x3:\n\nRow 0: 9,3,4\n\nRow 1:9,4,4\n\nRow 2:9,3,4\n\nSo columns are:\n\nCol0: 9,9,9\n\nCol1:3,4,3\n\nCol2:4,4,4\n\nSo the transpose would have rows as those columns.\n\nSo output rows would be:\n\n[9,9,9]\n\n[3,4,3]\n\n[4,4,4]\n\nWhich is the transpose. So that's the expected output."
