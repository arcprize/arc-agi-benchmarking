        "cot_1": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. Looking at the training examples, I notice that each input is a 3x3 grid, and the output is a 6x6 grid. So the first thing is that the output size is double the input size. But how exactly are they expanding it?\n\nLet's look at Example 0. The input is three rows of [3,3,3], [0,2,2], [1,1,0]. The output has six rows. The first row of the output is [3,3,3,3,3,3], which seems like the original first row is mirrored. Wait, the original row has three elements. If we mirror it, it would be 3 elements plus their reverse, but here it's six elements. So maybe each element is duplicated and then mirrored. Like, for [3,3,3], duplicating each element gives [3,3,3,3,3,3]? Or maybe the original row is followed by its reverse. Wait, the original row is [3,3,3], reversed is same, so the output row would be that. But in the output, the first row is all 3s. So perhaps each row is extended by appending a reversed copy of itself. For a 3-element row, reversed would be 3 elements, making total 6. That makes sense. Let's check.\n\nTake Example 0's second input row [0,2,2]. Reversed is [2,2,0]. Wait, no. Wait, the original is [0,2,2]. Reverse would be [2,2,0]. So appending that gives [0,2,2,2,2,0], which matches the second output row. Similarly, the third input row is [1,1,0]. Reversed is [0,1,1]. So combined, [1,1,0,0,1,1], which matches the third output row. Then the output has six rows. The first three rows are the input rows mirrored, and then the next three rows are the mirrored input rows again but in reverse order? Wait, looking at Example 0's output:\n\nRows 0-2 are:\n[3,3,3,3,3,3]\n[0,2,2,2,2,0]\n[1,1,0,0,1,1]\n\nRows 3-5 are:\n[1,1,0,0,1,1]\n[0,2,2,2,2,0]\n[3,3,3,3,3,3]\n\nOh, I see. The output is the original rows mirrored (each row is original + reversed) and then the mirrored rows are stacked in reverse order. So the first half of the output is the input rows each expanded by mirroring, and the second half is the same mirrored rows but in reverse order. So for a 3x3 input, the output is 6x6: each row is mirrored to make 6 elements, then the mirrored rows are duplicated in reverse order.\n\nSo for example, in Example 0, the input rows are row0, row1, row2. The output is row0_mirror, row1_mirror, row2_mirror, then row2_mirror, row1_mirror, row0_mirror. That matches the output.\n\nSame with Example 1. Let's check. The input rows are [3,3,1], [1,3,0], [0,2,2]. The output starts with each row mirrored: [3,3,1,1,3,3], [1,3,0,0,3,1], [0,2,2,2,2,0]. Then the next three rows are the same mirrored rows in reverse order: [0,2,2,2,2,0], [1,3,0,0,3,1], [3,3,1,1,3,3]. Which matches the output.\n\nSo the pattern is: each row of the input is mirrored (original followed by reversed) to form a row in the first half. Then, the mirrored rows are stacked again but in reverse order (so the third mirrored row comes next, then the second, then the first). So for a 3x3 input, the output is 6x6: the first three rows are the mirrored input rows, and the last three are the mirrored rows in reverse order.\n\nNow let's test this with the test input.\n\nTest Input:\n[1,1,0]\n[0,3,2]\n[3,3,0]\n\nFirst, mirror each row. For each row, append its reversed version.\n\nRow 0: [1,1,0] reversed is [0,1,1]. So mirrored row is [1,1,0,0,1,1].\nRow 1: [0,3,2] reversed is [2,3,0]. So mirrored row is [0,3,2,2,3,0].\nRow 2: [3,3,0] reversed is [0,3,3]. So mirrored row is [3,3,0,0,3,3].\n\nSo the first three output rows are:\n[1,1,0,0,1,1]\n[0,3,2,2,3,0]\n[3,3,0,0,3,3]\n\nThen, the next three rows are the mirrored rows in reverse order. So we take row2's mirrored row, row1's, then row0's.\n\nSo rows 3-5 would be:\n[3,3,0,0,3,3]\n[0,3,2,2,3,0]\n[1,1,0,0,1,1]\n\nPutting it all together, the output should be:\n\n[1,1,0,0,1,1]\n[0,3,2,2,3,0]\n[3,3,0,0,3,3]\n[3,3,0,0,3,3]\n[0,3,2,2,3,0]\n[1,1,0,0,1,1]\n\nLet me check if this matches the pattern of the training examples. Yes. Each input row is mirrored to double the length, then the mirrored rows are stacked in reverse order. That seems to fit all examples. Let's confirm with Example 2:\n\nInput row0: [2,1,0] reversed is [0,1,2], so mirrored row is [2,1,0,0,1,2]. Which matches the first output row. Then the last three rows are the mirrored rows reversed. So the output rows 3-5 are row2 mirrored (which is [0,3,0,0,3,0]), then row1 mirrored ([0,2,3,3,2,0]), then row0 mirrored ([2,1,0,0,1,2]). But in the output for example2, the third row is [0,3,0,0,3,0], fourth [0,2,3,3,2,0], fifth [2,1,0,0,1,2]. Wait, but the output for example2's last three rows are:\n\n[0,3,0,0,3,0]\n[0,3,0,0,3,0]\n[0,2,3,3,2,0]\n[2,1,0,0,1,2]\n\nWait, no. Wait example2's output is:\n\n[2, 1, 0, 0, 1, 2]\n[0, 2, 3, 3, 2, 0]\n[0, 3, 0, 0, 3, 0]\n[0, 3, 0, 0, 3, 0]\n[0, 2, 3, 3, 2, 0]\n[2, 1, 0, 0, 1, 2]\n\nAh, so the mirrored rows are the first three, then the next three are the same mirrored rows but in reverse order. So the order is:\n\nFirst three: row0_m, row1_m, row2_m.\n\nNext three: row2_m, row1_m, row0_m.\n\nWait no. Wait in example0, the output after the first three rows is row2_m, row1_m, row0_m. Because the input was rows 0,1,2, mirrored. Then the next three rows are 2,1,0 mirrored.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo for the test input, after the first three mirrored rows (row0_m, row1_m, row2_m), the next three would be row2_m, row1_m, row0_m.\n\nSo the test input output would be:\n\nRow0_m: [1,1,0,0,1,1]\n\nRow1_m: [0,3,2,2,3,0]\n\nRow2_m: [3,3,0,0,3,3]\n\nThen:\n\nRow3: row2_m \u2192 [3,3,0,0,3,3]\n\nRow4: row1_m \u2192 [0,3,2,2,3,0]\n\nRow5: row0_m \u2192 [1,1,0,0,1,1]\n\nSo the full output is as I wrote earlier. Let me check again.\n\nYes, that's correct. So the answer should be that structure.",

        "cot_2": "Okay, let's see. I need to figure out the pattern that transforms the input matrices into the output matrices in the training examples. Then apply that pattern to the test input.\n\nLooking at Example 0:\n\nInput is a 3x3 matrix:\n[3, 3, 3]\n[0, 2, 2]\n[1, 1, 0]\n\nOutput is a 6x6 matrix. Let me check the structure. The output has 6 rows, which is double the 3 rows of the input. Similarly, each row in the output has 6 elements, double the 3 in the input. So the transformation is probably mirroring each row to double its length, then mirroring the rows themselves to double the rows.\n\nLooking at the first row of input Example 0: [3,3,3]. The output first row is [3,3,3,3,3,3]. That looks like taking the original row and appending its reverse. Wait, no. Wait, original row is 3 elements. To get 6 elements, maybe it's the original row concatenated with its reverse. Wait 3 elements reversed would be [3,3,3], so adding that gives [3,3,3,3,3,3]. But in Example 1:\n\nInput row [3,3,1] becomes [3,3,1,1,3,3]. So original is [3,3,1], reversed would be [1,3,3], but then concatenating gives [3,3,1,1,3,3]. Wait, but the original and reversed are mirrored. Wait, maybe the row is duplicated in reverse order but with some overlap?\n\nWait, for a 3-element row, when you mirror it, perhaps you take the original elements, then append the reverse of the elements except the first. So for [3,3,1], original is 3 elements. If we mirror, the first three elements are as is, then the next three are the reverse of the original. Wait, [3,3,1] reversed is [1,3,3]. So the output row would be [3,3,1,1,3,3]. Yes, that's how Example 1's first row is formed. So the pattern for each row is to take the original row and append its reverse. Because for a row of length N, the mirrored version would be original + reversed. So length becomes 2N. But in the examples, the input rows are length 3, output rows are 6. So that's 3*2. That seems to fit.\n\nBut let's check another row. In Example 0, the second input row is [0,2,2]. The output is [0,2,2,2,2,0]. Wait, original is [0,2,2], reversed is [2,2,0]. So original + reversed would be [0,2,2,2,2,0]. Yes, that's exactly the output. Similarly, the third input row is [1,1,0]. Reversed is [0,1,1]. So original + reversed is [1,1,0,0,1,1]. But in the output, the third and fourth rows are both [1,1,0,0,1,1]. So for the rows, each input row is mirrored to make a row of double length. Then, the rows themselves are mirrored. Wait, the output in Example 0 has 6 rows. Let's list them:\n\nRow 0: [3,3,3,3,3,3]\nRow 1: [0,2,2,2,2,0]\nRow 2: [1,1,0,0,1,1]\nRow 3: [1,1,0,0,1,1]\nRow 4: [0,2,2,2,2,0]\nRow 5: [3,3,3,3,3,3]\n\nSo the original input has 3 rows. The output has 6 rows, which is the original 3 rows, each mirrored as per the row pattern, followed by the reverse of those mirrored rows. So rows 0 to 2 are mirrored, then rows 2 to 0 again. Wait, rows 0,1,2 of the mirrored rows are the first three, then rows 3,4,5 are the same as rows 2,1,0. For example, in Example 0, row 3 is same as row 2, row 4 same as row 1, row 5 same as row 0. So the output matrix is created by taking each input row, mirroring it (original + reversed) to double the columns, then mirroring the rows (original rows followed by reversed rows) to double the rows.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. For each row in the input, create a new row by appending the reverse of the row. So the new row has double the length.\n\n2. Then, take all these new rows and append the reverse of these rows (excluding the last one to avoid duplication). Wait, no. Because in Example 0, the input has 3 rows. The output has 6 rows. So the mirrored rows in the output are the original transformed rows followed by the transformed rows in reverse order. So after transforming each input row into a mirrored row (doubling columns), the output matrix is the transformed rows followed by the reverse of those transformed rows (excluding the middle row if the count is odd). Wait, for 3 rows transformed, the output is 6 rows: transformed rows 0,1,2 followed by 2,1,0. So total rows: 3*2 =6. So the process is:\n\n- Mirror each row (double the columns).\n\n- Mirror the entire list of mirrored rows (double the rows).\n\nSo for the input matrix with R rows and C columns, the output is a 2R x 2C matrix.\n\nBut wait, in Example 0, input is 3x3, output 6x6. So yes, 2x in both dimensions.\n\nSo applying this to the test input.\n\nTest Input:\n\n[1, 1, 0]\n\n[0, 3, 2]\n\n[3, 3, 0]\n\nFirst, process each row by mirroring. Let's do each row:\n\nFirst row: [1,1,0]. Reverse is [0,1,1]. So mirrored row is [1,1,0,0,1,1].\n\nSecond row: [0,3,2]. Reverse is [2,3,0]. So mirrored row is [0,3,2,2,3,0].\n\nThird row: [3,3,0]. Reverse is [0,3,3]. Mirrored row: [3,3,0,0,3,3].\n\nNow, these are the transformed rows (3 rows). Then, we need to mirror the rows themselves. So after these three rows, we add the reverse of these rows. So rows 0,1,2 become rows 0,1,2,2,1,0.\n\nSo the output matrix will have 6 rows:\n\nRow 0: [1,1,0,0,1,1]\n\nRow 1: [0,3,2,2,3,0]\n\nRow 2: [3,3,0,0,3,3]\n\nRow 3: [3,3,0,0,3,3]\n\nRow 4: [0,3,2,2,3,0]\n\nRow 5: [1,1,0,0,1,1]\n\nLet me check this against the examples to see if this matches the pattern.\n\nIn Example 2, the input is:\n\n[2,1,0]\n\n[0,2,3]\n\n[0,3,0]\n\nThe transformed rows would be:\n\nFirst row [2,1,0] reversed is [0,1,2], so mirrored row [2,1,0,0,1,2]. Which matches the output's first row.\n\nSecond row [0,2,3] reversed is [3,2,0], so mirrored row [0,2,3,3,2,0]. Which matches the output's second row.\n\nThird row [0,3,0] reversed is [0,3,0], so mirrored row [0,3,0,0,3,0]. Which matches the third row. Then mirrored rows are added in reverse order, so rows 2,1,0 again. Which matches the output.\n\nSo the pattern holds. Therefore, applying this to the test input, the output should be as I outlined."
