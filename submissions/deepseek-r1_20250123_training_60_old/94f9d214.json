        "cot_1": "Okay, let's tackle this puzzle. So, the task is to figure out the pattern that transforms the given input matrices into the output matrices. Let's look at the training examples to find the rules.\n\nStarting with Example 0. The input has 8 rows, and the output is 4 rows. So maybe each pair of input rows combines into one output row? Let's check. The first two input rows are [0,0,0,0] and [0,3,3,0]. The first output row is [2,2,2,0]. Hmm, how do these combine? Not immediately obvious. Let's look at the numbers. The output has 2s and 0s. Maybe the 3s in the input are somehow turning into 2s in the output, but only under certain conditions.\n\nLooking at Example 0's input, the first two rows of the input are the first two in the list. The output's first row is [2,2,2,0]. Wait, the first input row is all zeros except maybe the second and third elements in the second row are 3. But the output's first row has three 2s. Not sure yet.\n\nAnother approach: the outputs are 4 rows, which is half of the input's 8 rows. So maybe each pair of input rows (i.e., two consecutive rows) is processed into one output row. Let's check Example 0's first two input rows:\n\nInput row 0: [0,0,0,0]\nInput row 1: [0,3,3,0]\nOutput row 0: [2,2,2,0]\n\nHmm. How do these two rows combine? Maybe looking at each column. Let's check column 0: 0 and 0 in input, output is 2. Column 1: 0 and 3 \u2192 2. Column 2: 0 and 3 \u2192 2. Column 3: 0 and 0 \u2192 0. So perhaps when one of the two rows in a column has a 3 and the other is 0, it becomes 2. But in column 1, the first row is 0, second is 3 \u2192 2. But if both are 3, like in Example 1's first input row [3,3,3,3] and the next row [0,3,3,0], the output's first row is [0,0,0,0]. So maybe when both rows in a column are 3, the output is 0? Or maybe the 3s in the input affect the output based on some other rule.\n\nWait, maybe the 3s and 1s are part of a different system. Let's look at the other elements. The input also has 1s in later rows. Let's see how they might relate. For example, in Example 0, the input has rows with 1s and 3s, but the output only has 2s and 0s. So perhaps the 3s and 1s in the input are interacting to create the output's 2s.\n\nAnother thought: perhaps the output is determined by the presence of 3s and 1s in certain positions across the input rows. Maybe each output cell is a 2 if there's a 3 in the corresponding column in the first half of the input and a 1 in the same column in the second half. Let's check.\n\nTake Example 0's first output row [2,2,2,0]. The first two input rows (part of the first half, maybe) have 3s in columns 1 and 2. Then, looking at the second half (rows 4-7), maybe columns 1 and 2 in those rows. Wait, the input rows 4-7 for Example 0 are:\n\n[0, 0, 0, 1]\n[1, 0, 1, 1]\n[1, 1, 1, 1]\n[0, 1, 0, 1]\n\nHmm. For column 0 in the output's first row (2), maybe the first two input rows (columns 0 and 0) have 0 and 0, but in the second half, column 0 has 0,1,1,0. Not sure. Alternatively, maybe each output row is derived from two input rows: one from the first four and one from the last four. For example, output row 0 combines input row 0 and row 4. Let's check.\n\nExample 0's input row 0: [0,0,0,0], row 4: [0,0,0,1]. The output row 0 is [2,2,2,0]. How could these two combine? If a 0 in row 0 and a 0 in row 4 result in 2? No, because the fourth column in row 0 is 0 and row 4 is 1, but output is 0. Maybe it's the presence of 3s in the upper rows and 1s in the lower rows. Let's see.\n\nIn Example 0's first output row, columns 0,1,2 are 2. Looking at the first input row (row 0) for those columns: all 0. But the next row (row 1) has 3s in columns 1 and 2. Then, looking at the lower rows (rows 4-7), maybe columns 0,1,2 in rows 4-7. Let's see row 4's columns 0-2: 0,0,0. Row 5: 1,0,1. Row 6: 1,1,1. Row 7: 0,1,0. Hmm, not sure how that would sum to 2s. Alternatively, maybe count the number of 3s in the upper four rows and 1s in the lower four rows for each column. Let's take column 0 in Example 0:\n\nUpper rows (0-3) for column 0: 0,0,0,3 \u2192 sum of 3s is 1 (only row 3 has 3). Lower rows (4-7) for column 0: 0,1,1,0 \u2192 sum of 1s is 2. So 3s in upper rows: 1, 1s in lower: 2. Output for column 0 is 2. Similarly, column 1 upper: 0,3,0,0 \u2192 sum of 3s is 1. Lower rows: 0,0,1,1 \u2192 sum of 1s is 2. Output is 2. Column 2 upper: 0,3,0,0 \u2192 sum 3s is 1. Lower: 0,1,1,0 \u2192 sum 1s is 2. Output 2. Column 3 upper: 0,0,0,3 \u2192 sum 3s is 1. Lower: 1,1,1,1 \u2192 sum 1s is 4. But output is 0. So this doesn't align. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe the output is 2 if there's at least one 3 in the upper part and at least one 1 in the lower part of the same column. Let's check. Column 0 in Example 0's output is 2. Upper part (rows 0-3) column 0: 0,0,0,3 \u2192 there is a 3. Lower part (rows 4-7) column 0: 0,1,1,0 \u2192 has 1s. So yes, 2. Column 3 in output is 0. Upper has a 3 (row3, column3), lower has 1s (rows4-7, column3 has 1,1,1,1). But output is 0. So this hypothesis is wrong.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is 2 only if the count of 3s in the upper four rows for that column equals the count of 1s in the lower four rows. Let's check Example 0's column 0: upper 3s count is 1 (row3, column0 is 3). Lower 1s in column0: rows5 and 6 (1s). So count 2. 1 vs 2: not equal. So output 2 in column0. Doesn't fit.\n\nAnother angle: looking at the positions where both the upper and lower rows have non-zero. Maybe 3 in upper and 1 in lower. For example, if in a certain column, any of the upper four rows has a 3 and any of the lower four rows has a 1, then output 2. Otherwise 0. Let's check Example 0's output row 0. Column0: upper has 3 in row3, lower has 1s in rows5,6. So 2. Column1: upper has 3 in row1 and 2, lower has 1s in rows6,7. So 2. Column2: same as column1? Wait, upper for column2: rows1 and 2. Row1 has 3, row2 has 0. So 3 in row1. Lower rows: rows5 has 1, row6 has 1, row7 has 0. So yes, 1 in lower. So 2. Column3: upper has 3 in row3. Lower has 1s in rows4,5,6,7. But output is 0. Hmm, why?\n\nWait, maybe the rule is that if in a column, there is at least one 3 in the first four rows and exactly two 1s in the last four rows, then output 2. Otherwise 0. Let's check column3 in Example0: lower rows (rows4-7) column3: 1,1,1,1 \u2192 four 1s. So output 0. But column0 in lower has two 1s. So 2. Column1: lower rows have 0,0,1,1 \u2192 two 1s. So output 2. Column2: lower rows have 0,1,1,0 \u2192 two 1s. So output 2. Column3 has four 1s \u2192 output 0. That seems to fit. So the pattern would be: for each column, if in the upper four rows (first four input rows) there's at least one 3, and in the lower four rows (last four input rows) there are exactly two 1s, then output 2. Otherwise 0.\n\nLet's check other examples to verify. Take Example1's output first row [0,0,0,0]. Let's look at column0. Upper four rows: row0 has 3, row1 has 0, row2 has 0, row3 has3. So upper has 3s. Lower four rows for column0: rows4-7: 0,0,0,1. The counts of 1s are 1. So not two \u2192 output 0. Which matches.\n\nAnother example: Example1's output row2 is [2,0,0,0]. Let's see which column it's in. Wait, output has four rows. Wait, maybe each output row corresponds to two input rows. Wait, maybe the output is four rows because each is derived from two input rows from the first four and two from the last four? Not sure. Alternatively, maybe each output row corresponds to one pair of upper and lower rows. For example, output row0 is upper row0 and lower row4, output row1 is upper row1 and lower row5, etc. Let's check Example0:\n\nOutput has four rows. Let's see:\n\nOutput row0: [2,2,2,0]. Upper rows 0 and 1, lower rows4 and5?\n\nWait, input rows 0 and1: [0,0,0,0], [0,3,3,0]. Lower rows4 and5: [0,0,0,1], [1,0,1,1].\n\nBut how does this combine? For column0: upper rows 0 and1 have 0 and 0. Lower rows4 and5 have 0 and1. So maybe count the number of 3s in upper two rows and 1s in lower two rows. For column0: 0 3s in upper two rows (since rows0 and1 have 0 and0 in column0). But output column0 is 2. Hmm, this contradicts.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each output row is a combination of two upper rows and two lower rows. For example, output row0 is upper rows0-1 and lower rows4-5. But how to process that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is formed by taking each pair of consecutive input rows (like row0 and row1, row2 and row3, etc.), and processing them into an output row. Then, since there are 8 input rows, this would produce 4 output rows. Let's check Example0's input:\n\nInput rows0-1: [0,0,0,0], [0,3,3,0]. Output row0: [2,2,2,0]. How to get that from these two rows. Maybe 3s in row1 become 2s where there are 0s in row0. So if a cell in row1 is 3 and the same cell in row0 is 0, then output 2. Otherwise 0. Let's see:\n\nRow0: 0,0,0,0\n\nRow1:0,3,3,0\n\nSo cells where row1 has 3 and row0 has 0: columns1 and2. So output would be 0,2,2,0. But the output row0 is [2,2,2,0]. So that doesn't match. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, if the sum of 3s in the two rows. For example, in each column, sum the 3s. But row0 has 0, row1 has 0,3,3,0. So sum per column: 0,3,3,0. But output is 2,2,2,0. So 3 becomes 2. But then why?\n\nAlternatively, if any 3 in the two rows, output 2. But in that case, columns1 and2 would have 3s, so output 2,2,0. But the output row0 has 2 in column0, which has 0 in both rows. So that doesn't fit.\n\nWait, maybe the output is counting the number of 3s in the upper part and 1s in the lower part for each column, but in a different way. Let's take Example0's output. The output is four rows. Wait, maybe each output row corresponds to two input rows from the upper and two from the lower. Like, output row0 is upper rows0-1 and lower rows4-5. Let's check:\n\nFor column0 in output row0:\n\nUpper rows0-1 column0: 0 and0 \u2192 sum 0.\n\nLower rows4-5 column0: 0 and1 \u2192 sum 1.\n\nHow does that result in 2? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each output cell is 2 if there's a 3 in the same column in the upper part (rows0-3) and a 1 in the same column in the lower part (rows4-7). So for a column, if there's at least one 3 in upper four rows and at least one 1 in lower four rows, then 2, else 0. Let's check Example0's output:\n\nColumn0: upper has a 3 in row3 (value3). Lower has 1s in rows5,6. So yes, 2.\n\nColumn1: upper has 3 in row1. Lower has 1s in rows6 and7. So 2.\n\nColumn2: upper has 3 in row1. Lower has 1s in rows5,6. So 2.\n\nColumn3: upper has 3 in row3. Lower has 1s in all rows. So why output 0? According to this rule, it should be 2. But output is 0. So this rule doesn't hold.\n\nHmm. That's confusing. Let's look at Example0's output column3: 0. Upper has 3 in row3. Lower has 1s in rows4,5,6,7. So according to the previous rule, should output 2. But it's 0. So maybe there's an exception.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the count of 1s in the lower part must be even? For column3 in Example0, lower has four 1s (even) \u2192 output 0. Column0: lower has two 1s (even) \u2192 output 2. Column1: lower has two 1s \u2192 output2. Column2: lower has two 1s \u2192 output2. So maybe the rule is: 2 if upper has at least one 3 and lower has even number of 1s. Else 0.\n\nTesting this with Example0's column3: upper has 3, lower has 4 (even) \u2192 should be 2, but output is 0. So that doesn't fit. So maybe even isn't the right condition.\n\nWait in Example0's output, column3 is 0. Upper has 3, lower has four 1s. Maybe if the count of 1s in lower is exactly two, then output 2. Let's check:\n\nExample0 column3: lower has four 1s \u2192 not two \u2192 output 0. Column0: lower has two \u2192 output2. So this fits. Column1: lower has two \u2192 output2. Column2: lower has two \u2192 output2. So the rule would be: for each column, if there's at least one 3 in the upper four rows and exactly two 1s in the lower four rows, then output 2. Else 0.\n\nLet's check this against other examples.\n\nExample1's output row0 is [0,0,0,0]. Let's look at each column.\n\nUpper rows (0-3) for Example1:\n\nRow0: [3,3,3,3]\n\nRow1: [0,3,3,0]\n\nRow2: [0,0,3,3]\n\nRow3: [3,0,0,0]\n\nLower rows (4-7):\n\nRow4: [0,0,0,1]\n\nRow5: [0,0,0,1]\n\nRow6: [0,1,0,0]\n\nRow7: [1,0,0,1]\n\nOutput row0 is [0,0,0,0]. So for each column:\n\nColumn0:\n\nUpper: 3 (row0), 0, 0, 3 \u2192 at least one 3.\n\nLower: 0,0,0,1 \u2192 count of 1s is 1. So not two \u2192 output0.\n\nColumn1:\n\nUpper: 3,3,0,0 \u2192 yes.\n\nLower: 0,0,1,0 \u2192 count 1 \u2192 output0.\n\nColumn2:\n\nUpper: 3,3,3,0 \u2192 yes.\n\nLower:0,0,0,0 \u2192 count 0 \u2192 output0.\n\nColumn3:\n\nUpper:3,0,3,0 \u2192 yes.\n\nLower:1,1,0,1 \u2192 count3 \u2192 output0.\n\nSo the output is 0s, which matches.\n\nNow look at Example1's output row2: [2,0,0,0].\n\nOutput row2 is third row in the output. How does this relate? Maybe each output row corresponds to a pair of upper and lower rows. But output has four rows. Alternatively, perhaps each output row is a combination of two upper rows and two lower rows. For example, output row0 is upper rows0-1 and lower rows4-5. But not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each output row is derived from the upper two rows and lower two rows in pairs. For instance:\n\nOutput row0: upper rows0 and1, lower rows4 and5.\n\nOutput row1: upper rows2 and3, lower rows6 and7.\n\nBut how does this fit into four rows?\n\nWait, in Example1's output, there are four output rows. The input has eight rows. So perhaps each output row is formed by combining two consecutive input rows from the first four (upper) and two from the last four (lower). But not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by processing each column across all eight input rows, applying some rule per column. For example, for each column in the output, if certain conditions are met (like presence of 3s and 1s in specific positions), then output 2 or 0.\n\nLet's take Example1's output row1 is [2,0,0,0]. So in output row1, column0 is 2. Let's check the upper and lower for column0.\n\nUpper (rows0-3) column0: 3,0,0,3 \u2192 at least one 3.\n\nLower (rows4-7) column0: 0,0,0,1 \u2192 count of 1s is 1. But according to the previous rule (exactly two 1s), this should be 0. But output is 2 here. So this contradicts the earlier hypothesis.\n\nHmm, this is getting complicated. Let's try another approach.\n\nLooking at the outputs, they have 2s and 0s. The 2s might represent a condition where certain criteria are met. Let's see if there's a positional relationship. For example, in Example0's output, the first row has 2s in columns0-2. Looking at the first two input rows (rows0 and1), and their corresponding lower rows (rows4 and5). Maybe if in the same position, there's a 3 in upper and a 1 in lower, then output 2. Let's check:\n\nExample0's first output row, column0: upper rows0 and1 have 0 and0. So no 3 here. But output is 2. So that doesn't fit.\n\nWait, but maybe it's looking at the entire upper four rows and lower four rows, regardless of the row pairs.\n\nLet's go back to the initial hypothesis: for each column in the output, if there's at least one 3 in the upper four rows and exactly two 1s in the lower four rows, then output 2. Else 0.\n\nBut in Example1's output row1 is [2,0,0,0]. Let's check column0 for the entire input:\n\nUpper rows0-3 column0: 3,0,0,3 \u2192 has 3s.\n\nLower rows4-7 column0: 0,0,0,1 \u2192 count of 1s is 1. So according to the rule, should be 0. But output is 2. So this rule is invalid.\n\nHmm. Maybe the rule is different. Let's try to find another pattern.\n\nLooking at the output rows in Example1:\n\nThe output has four rows. The first row is [0,0,0,0], the second [2,0,0,0], third [2,0,0,0], fourth [0,2,2,0]. Let's see how these rows are formed.\n\nFor Example1's input:\n\nUpper four rows:\n\nRow0: [3,3,3,3]\n\nRow1: [0,3,3,0]\n\nRow2: [0,0,3,3]\n\nRow3: [3,0,0,0]\n\nLower four rows:\n\nRow4: [0,0,0,1]\n\nRow5: [0,0,0,1]\n\nRow6: [0,1,0,0]\n\nRow7: [1,0,0,1]\n\nOutput rows:\n\nRow0: [0,0,0,0]\n\nRow1: [2,0,0,0]\n\nRow2: [2,0,0,0]\n\nRow3: [0,2,2,0]\n\nLooking at output row1 (index1) [2,0,0,0]. What's special about column0 here. Perhaps looking at the upper and lower rows in a specific way. For example, output row1 is determined by upper row1 and lower row5. Let's check:\n\nUpper row1: [0,3,3,0]\n\nLower row5: [0,0,0,1]\n\nFor column0: 0 and0. So how does this result in 2? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each output row is generated by combining two upper and two lower rows. For example, output row0 combines upper rows0-1 and lower rows4-5. Output row1 combines upper rows1-2 and lower rows5-6. Output row2 combines upper rows2-3 and lower rows6-7. Output row3 combines upper row3 and lower row7 (but that's not two each). Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output rows correspond to the upper rows, and the lower rows are used to modify them. For example, for each upper row, if certain conditions from the lower rows are met, then change to 2.\n\nAlternatively, think of the input as two separate 4x4 grids stacked. The first four rows form one grid, and the last four form another. The output is a 4x4 grid where each cell is 2 if the corresponding cell in the upper grid is 3 and the same cell in the lower grid is 1. Otherwise 0. Let's test this.\n\nExample0's upper grid:\n\nRow0: [0,0,0,0]\n\nRow1: [0,3,3,0]\n\nRow2: [0,0,0,0]\n\nRow3: [3,0,0,3]\n\nLower grid:\n\nRow4: [0,0,0,1]\n\nRow5: [1,0,1,1]\n\nRow6: [1,1,1,1]\n\nRow7: [0,1,0,1]\n\nBut the output is 4 rows. If we compare upper and lower grids cell by cell:\n\nFor output cell (0,0): upper is 0 (row0), lower is 0 (row4) \u2192 0. But output row0, column0 is 2. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAnother idea: maybe each output row is a combination of two upper rows and two lower rows, perhaps XORing 3s and 1s. Or maybe the output is 2 in positions where there's a 3 in the upper part and a 1 in the lower part in the same column but any row.\n\nIn Example0's column0: upper has 3 in row3. Lower has 1s in row5,6. So that's a 3 and a 1 \u2192 2. Column1: 3 in row1 and 3 in row1. Lower has 1 in row6 and7. So 3 and 1 \u2192 2. Column3: 3 in row3, but lower has 1s \u2192 output 0. Why? So this theory has a problem.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the count of 3s in the upper part of a column plus the count of 1s in the lower part equals 2. Then output 2. Otherwise 0. Let's see:\n\nExample0 column0: upper has one 3, lower has two 1s. Sum is 3 \u2192 output 2? Not sure. But Example0's output is 2 here.\n\nExample0 column3: upper has one 3, lower has four 1s. Sum is 5 \u2192 output0. Which fits if the sum is even. But sum is 5 (odd). Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, the product of upper 3 count and lower 1 count. If product is even, output 2. Else 0. For Example0 column0: 1 * 2 =2 \u2192 even \u2192 2. Column3: 1*4=4 \u2192 even \u2192 output2. But Example0's column3 output is 0. So that's not right.\n\nThis is getting frustrating. Let's try to look for another pattern. Maybe each output cell is 2 if there's a 3 in the same column in the first four rows and a 1 in the same column in the last four rows, but only in specific rows. For example, for output row i, column j, if the upper row i has 3 and the lower row i+4 has 1, then output 2. Let's check Example0:\n\nOutput row0: [2,2,2,0]\n\nUpper row0: [0,0,0,0]\n\nLower row4: [0,0,0,1]\n\nSo upper row0 has 0s. Lower row4 has 1 in column3. But output row0's column3 is 0. So this doesn't work. However, output row0's columns0-2 are 2. Upper row0 is all 0s. So that's not possible.\n\nAnother angle: maybe each output row is the result of a bitwise operation between two rows. For instance, upper row0 OR lower row4. But 0 OR 0 is 0, and 0 OR 1 is 1. But output is 2, which isn't part of OR. So maybe not.\n\nLooking at the outputs, the 2s must be a new value introduced by the transformation. So the pattern must involve combining the 3s and 1s somehow. Maybe 3s are converted to 2s if there's a 1 in the corresponding position in the lower rows, but I'm not sure.\n\nAnother approach: look at the positions of 2s in the outputs and see if they correlate to specific patterns in the input.\n\nIn Example0's output, the first row has three 2s. Looking at the first four input rows, the first two rows have 3s in columns1 and 2. The lower four rows have 1s in various positions. For example, rows4-7, column0 has 1s in rows5 and6. Column1 has 1s in rows6 and7. Column2 has 1s in rows5 and6. So maybe the 2s are where the 3s in the upper rows are adjacent to 1s in the lower rows. But how?\n\nAlternatively, think of the first four rows as layers and the last four as another. For each column, if there's a 3 in any of the first four layers and a 1 in any of the last four layers, then output 2. But Example0's column3 has 3 in upper and 1s in lower, but output is 0. So this isn't the case.\n\nWait, in Example0's output, column3 has 0. Upper has 3 in row3, column3. Lower rows4-7 have 1s in column3. So why is it 0? There must be a different rule here.\n\nPerhaps the rule involves the exact positions where 3s and 1s appear. For instance, a 3 in the upper part and a 1 in the lower part in the same row. But since upper and lower are separate, that's unclear.\n\nAnother idea: maybe the output is a sum where each 3 in the upper four rows contributes +1 and each 1 in the lower four rows contributes +1, modulo 3. But Example0's column0: upper has one 3 (row3), lower has two 1s \u2192 sum 3 \u2192 0 mod3. But output is 2. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is 2 if the number of 3s in upper rows plus the number of 1s in lower rows is even. Example0's column0: 1+2=3 (odd) \u2192 output 2. No. Doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, if the count of 3s in upper and 1s in lower is exactly 3. Example0's column0: 1+2=3 \u2192 output2. Column3:1+4=5 \u2192 0. That fits. Column1:1+2=3\u21922. Column2:1+2=3\u21922. So output would be 2 where sum is3. But let's check Example1's output row1 column0: upper 3s count is 2 (rows0 and3), lower 1s count is1 (rows4,5,6,7 column0: 0,0,0,1 \u2192 count1). Sum 3 \u2192 output2. Which matches. Example1's output row1 column0 is 2. So this might be the pattern.\n\nLet's test another example. Example2's output row1 is [0,0,2,0]. Let's check column2. Upper rows0-3 column2: input is rows0:3, row1:0, row2:3, row3:3. So count of 3s is 3. Lower rows4-7 column2: rows4:1, row5:0, row6:0, row7:1 \u2192 count 2. Sum 3+2=5. If sum is 5, output would be 0 (if the rule is sum exactly 3). But output is 2 here. So this doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. Back to square one.\n\nWait, maybe the output is 2 only if the number of 3s in upper rows is exactly 1 and the number of 1s in lower rows is exactly 2. Example0's columns0-2: upper 1 3, lower 2 1s \u2192 output2. Column3: upper1 3, lower4 1s \u2192 output0. This fits. Example1's output row1 column0: upper has 2 3s (rows0 and3), lower has1 1. So 2+1=3. Output is2, which would not fit. But Example1's output row1 has 2 in column0. So this doesn't fit.\n\nWait, maybe it's the product of the counts. For Example0, column0: 1 *2=2 \u2192 output2. Column3:1*4=4 \u2192 output0. So maybe 2 if product is even. 2 is even \u2192 output2. 4 even \u2192 output0. But this doesn't make sense. No.\n\nAlternative approach: Let's compare the test input and see if we can find a pattern by applying possible rules.\n\nTest Input:\n\n[0, 3, 0, 3]\n\n[3, 3, 3, 0]\n\n[0, 0, 0, 3]\n\n[3, 3, 3, 0]\n\n[0, 0, 1, 1]\n\n[0, 0, 1, 1]\n\n[0, 1, 0, 0]\n\n[1, 1, 0, 0]\n\nSo upper four rows (0-3):\n\nRow0: [0,3,0,3]\n\nRow1: [3,3,3,0]\n\nRow2: [0,0,0,3]\n\nRow3: [3,3,3,0]\n\nLower four rows (4-7):\n\nRow4: [0,0,1,1]\n\nRow5: [0,0,1,1]\n\nRow6: [0,1,0,0]\n\nRow7: [1,1,0,0]\n\nWe need to generate an output of four rows. Let's assume the same pattern as the examples. Let's think of possible rules.\n\nLooking back at the training examples, the output seems to have 2s where certain conditions are met in the upper and lower parts of the input. Let's try the initial hypothesis: for each column, if there's at least one 3 in the upper four rows and exactly two 1s in the lower four rows, output 2, else 0.\n\nLet's apply this to the test input.\n\nFor each column:\n\nColumn0:\n\nUpper rows: 0,3,0,3 \u2192 has 3s in row1 and 3.\n\nLower rows: rows4-7 column0: 0,0,0,1 \u2192 count of 1s is1. So not two \u2192 output0.\n\nColumn1:\n\nUpper rows:3,3,0,3 \u2192 has 3s.\n\nLower rows:0,0,1,1 \u2192 count of 1s is2. So output2.\n\nColumn2:\n\nUpper rows:0,3,0,3 \u2192 has 3s.\n\nLower rows:1,1,0,0 \u2192 count of 1s is2 \u2192 output2.\n\nColumn3:\n\nUpper rows:3,0,3,0 \u2192 has 3s.\n\nLower rows:1,1,0,0 \u2192 count of 1s is2 \u2192 output2.\n\nWait, but this would mean the output rows have 2s in columns1,2,3. But how does this translate into the output rows? Because the output in the examples is four rows, but according to this per-column rule, each column would have a single value for all output rows. But the training examples have varying 2s in different rows. So this approach is likely wrong.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each output row is determined by pairs of upper and lower rows. For example, each output row corresponds to two upper rows and two lower rows. Let's try to see.\n\nTest input has eight rows. Let's pair them as follows:\n\nOutput row0: upper rows0 and1, lower rows4 and5.\n\nOutput row1: upper rows1 and2, lower rows5 and6.\n\nOutput row2: upper rows2 and3, lower rows6 and7.\n\nOutput row3: upper rows3 and0, lower rows7 and4. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, output rows are made by combining upper and lower rows in pairs. For example, upper row0 + lower row4 = output row0.\n\nLet's test this for Example0:\n\nUpper row0: [0,0,0,0], lower row4: [0,0,0,1]. Output row0: [2,2,2,0]. How? Not obvious.\n\nAlternatively, for each cell in output row0, if upper row0 cell is 3 and lower row4 cell is1, then 2. Else 0. But upper row0 is 0s, lower row4 column3 is1 \u2192 output would have 0 except column3 2. But output row0 has 2s in columns0-2. So no.\n\nAlternatively, for output row0, check for each column if there's a 3 in upper rows0-1 and a1 in lower rows4-5. For Example0:\n\nColumns0: upper rows0-1 are 0 and0 \u2192 no 3. But output is2. So no.\n\nAnother approach: Perhaps each output row is formed by subtracting the sum of the corresponding lower rows from the sum of the upper rows. But with possible modulo.\n\nExample0's output row0: sum of upper rows0-1:\n\nRow0: 0,0,0,0 \u2192 sum0.\n\nRow1:0+3+3+0=6.\n\nSum: 6.\n\nSum of lower rows4-5:\n\nRow4:0+0+0+1=1.\n\nRow5:1+0+1+1=3.\n\nSum:4.\n\n6-4=2 \u2192 but output row0's sum is 2+2+2+0=6. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is the count of 3s in the upper rows minus the count of 1s in the lower rows. But Example0's column0 upper has 1 3, lower has 2 1s. 1-2= -1 \u2192 not 2.\n\nThis is really challenging. Maybe the pattern involves the position of the 3s and 1s in the rows. For example, in each output row, a 2 is placed if in the corresponding upper rows there's a 3 followed by a 0 or other condition, and in the lower rows a 1 follows.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the output rows in the examples:\n\nExample0's output has the first row with 2s in columns0-2. Looking at upper rows0-1:\n\nRow0: all 0s.\n\nRow1: 0,3,3,0.\n\nMaybe when there's a transition from 0 to3 in the upper rows, and certain conditions in the lower rows. Like, if in the upper rows, a column has a 0 followed by a3, and in the corresponding lower rows, there's a1 and something else.\n\nAlternatively, think of the output as a grid where each cell is 2 if the corresponding column in the upper four rows has a 3 and the same column in the lower four rows has a 1, but only in certain rows. For instance, if there's a 3 in the same row of the upper part and a 1 in the same row of the lower part. But since upper and lower are separate, not sure.\n\nAnother observation: in all the output examples, the 2s appear in positions where there's a 3 in the upper rows and 1s in the lower rows, but not necessarily in the same row. For example, in Example0's output row0, column0: upper row3 has3, lower rows5 and6 have1. So maybe the output cell is 2 if there's at least one 3 in the upper four rows in that column and at least two 1s in the lower four rows. But how does that fit with the examples?\n\nExample0's column0: upper has one3, lower has two1s \u2192 output2.\n\nExample1's output row1 column0: upper has two3s, lower has one1 \u2192 output2. Which would contradict the rule of two 1s.\n\nWait, but in Example1's output row1 column0 is 2. Let's see:\n\nUpper rows for column0: rows0-3. Values are3,0,0,3 \u2192 two 3s.\n\nLower rows for column0: rows4-7. Values are0,0,0,1 \u2192 one1.\n\nSo if the rule is upper has at least one3 and lower has at least one1 \u2192 output2, then this would be the case. But in Example0's column3, which has a3 in upper and four1s in lower, output is0. So that can't be.\n\nAnother possibility: the output is 2 only if there's exactly one3 in the upper rows and exactly one1 in the lower rows for the column. Example0's column0 has one3 and two1s \u2192 output2. Doesn't fit. Example1's output row1 column0 has two3s and one1 \u2192 output2. Also doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, the output is 2 if the sum of 3s in upper and 1s in lower is even. Example0 column0: 1+2=3 (odd) \u2192 output2. No.\n\nThis is really tricky. Let's try to find another pattern.\n\nLooking at the test input:\n\nUpper rows:\n\nRow0: [0,3,0,3]\n\nRow1: [3,3,3,0]\n\nRow2: [0,0,0,3]\n\nRow3: [3,3,3,0]\n\nLower rows:\n\nRow4: [0,0,1,1]\n\nRow5: [0,0,1,1]\n\nRow6: [0,1,0,0]\n\nRow7: [1,1,0,0]\n\nLet's try to apply the per-column rule where output is 2 if there's at least one3 in upper and exactly two1s in lower.\n\nColumn0:\n\nUpper has 3s in rows1 and3 \u2192 yes.\n\nLower rows4-7 column0: 0,0,0,1 \u2192 count1. So output0.\n\nColumn1:\n\nUpper has 3s in rows0,1,3 \u2192 yes.\n\nLower rows4-7 column1:0,0,1,1 \u2192 count2 \u2192 output2.\n\nColumn2:\n\nUpper has 3s in rows1 and3 \u2192 yes.\n\nLower rows4-7 column2:1,1,0,0 \u2192 count2 \u2192 output2.\n\nColumn3:\n\nUpper has 3s in rows0,2 \u2192 yes.\n\nLower rows4-7 column3:1,1,0,0 \u2192 count2 \u2192 output2.\n\nSo according to this rule, the output columns would be:\n\n[0,2,2,2]\n\nBut how does this translate into the four output rows? Because the training examples' outputs have varying rows. For example, Example0's output rows are not all the same. So this approach is missing something.\n\nAh! Maybe each output row corresponds to two columns of the input. Or perhaps each output cell is determined by the interaction of two adjacent columns. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is generated by looking at pairs of upper and lower rows. For example, each output row is formed by taking an upper row and a lower row, and for each column, if the upper cell is3 and the lower cell is1, then output2. Otherwise0. But considering all combinations, how to pick which pairs.\n\nFor example, in Example0's output row0: [2,2,2,0]. Let's see if this corresponds to any pair:\n\nUpper row1: [0,3,3,0]\n\nLower row5: [1,0,1,1]\n\nFor each column:\n\n0:3 in upper and0 in lower \u21920.\n\n1:3 in upper and0 in lower \u21920.\n\n2:3 in upper and1 in lower \u21922.\n\n3:0 in upper and1 in lower \u21920.\n\nBut output row0 has 2s in columns0-2, which doesn't match.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output row is the sum of all possible pairs where upper has3 and lower has1. For example, for each column, the number of pairs where upper row has3 and lower row has1. If that count is even, output2. Otherwise0. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is 2 for a column if there's at least one pair (upper row, lower row) where the upper has3 and lower has1 in that column. But then in Example0's column0, upper row3 has3, lower row5 and6 have1 in column0. So output2. Column3 has3 in upper row3 and lower rows4-7 have1s. So output2. But Example0's output column3 is0. So this doesn't fit.\n\nThis is very challenging. Given the time I've spent and the lack of progress, perhaps I should consider that each output row is derived by comparing two upper rows and two lower rows. For example, output row0 is based on upper rows0-1 and lower rows4-5. For each column in output row0, if there's a3 in either row0 or row1 of the upper, and a1 in either row4 or row5 of the lower, then output2. Otherwise0.\n\nLet's apply this to Example0's output row0:\n\nUpper rows0-1: row0 [0,0,0,0], row1 [0,3,3,0].\n\nLower rows4-5: row4 [0,0,0,1], row5 [1,0,1,1].\n\nFor each column:\n\nColumn0: upper has no3s (row0 has0, row1 has0). So 0.\n\nBut output is2. So this doesn't work.\n\nAlternatively, if there's a3 in either upper rows0 or1, and a1 in either lower rows4 or5, then output2.\n\nFor column0: upper has no3s \u21920.\n\nBut output is2. So no.\n\nHmm. I'm stuck. Given the time I have, I'll try to proceed with the initial hypothesis that each column in the output is 2 if there's at least one3 in the upper four rows and exactly two1s in the lower four rows. Apply this to the test input.\n\nFor the test input:\n\nColumn0: upper has 3s in row1 and3. So yes. Lower has in column0: 0,0,0,1 \u2192 count1. So output0.\n\nColumn1: upper has3s. Lower has0,0,1,1 \u2192 count2 \u2192 output2.\n\nColumn2: upper has3s. Lower has1,1,0,0 \u2192 count2 \u2192 output2.\n\nColumn3: upper has3s in rows0 and2. Lower has1,1,0,0 \u2192 count2 \u2192 output2.\n\nSo per this, each column's output is:\n\nColumn0:0\n\nColumn1:2\n\nColumn2:2\n\nColumn3:2\n\nBut how to translate this into four rows? The training examples have outputs with varying rows. For example, Example0's output has rows with 2s and 0s arranged differently. So perhaps the output is arranged such that each row corresponds to a pair of upper and lower rows, and the 2s are placed based on the presence of 3s and 1s in those pairs.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the same for all rows, but the examples show varying rows because of different conditions. This doesn't make sense.\n\nAnother possibility: The output is a 4x4 matrix where each cell (i,j) is 2 if in the input's upper four rows, the cell (i,j) is 3 and in the lower four rows, cell (i,j) is 1. Otherwise 0.\n\nTesting this for Example0:\n\nUpper row0: all0 \u2192 output row0 would be0.\n\nUpper row1: columns1 and2 are3. Lower row1 is row5: [1,0,1,1]. So for output row1 (assuming output rows correspond to upper rows):\n\n cell1: lower row5 (row5 is index5, lower part is rows4-7. So row5 is lower row1. So upper row1 and lower row1 (row5) would check cell1: upper has3, lower row5 cell1 is0 \u2192 output0.\n\nThis doesn't fit Example0's output.\n\nAlternatively, output rows are the lower four rows, and each cell is 2 if the corresponding upper cell is3 and lower cell is1. For Example0's lower row4 (input row4) is [0,0,0,1]. Upper row0 is [0,0,0,0]. So output row4 would be0s except column3. But Example0's output row0 is [2,2,2,0]. So this doesn't fit.\n\nI'm running out of time. Given the test input and the possible pattern that per column, if upper has 3s and lower has exactly two 1s, output is 2, else0. So the test input's columns1-3 meet this criteria, so output would have 2s in those columns. But how to arrange into four rows.\n\nWait, maybe each output row corresponds to a pair of upper and lower rows, and for each column in that pair, if there's a3 in the upper row and a1 in the lower row, output2. Else0.\n\nFor the test input:\n\nOutput row0: upper row0 and lower row4.\n\n upper row0: [0,3,0,3]\n\n lower row4: [0,0,1,1]\n\n columns where upper is3 and lower is1: column2 and3. So output row0 would be [0,0,2,2].\n\nOutput row1: upper row1 and lower row5.\n\n upper row1: [3,3,3,0]\n\n lower row5: [0,0,1,1]\n\n columns with3 and1: column2. So output row1: [0,0,2,0].\n\nOutput row2: upper row2 and lower row6.\n\n upper row2: [0,0,0,3]\n\n lower row6: [0,1,0,0]\n\n columns: upper3 in column3, lower1 in column1. No overlap. So output [0,0,0,0].\n\nOutput row3: upper row3 and lower row7.\n\n upper row3: [3,3,3,0]\n\n lower row7: [1,1,0,0]\n\n columns with3 and1: column0 and1. So output row3: [2,2,0,0].\n\nNow, combine these four output rows:\n\nRow0: [0,0,2,2]\n\nRow1: [0,0,2,0]\n\nRow2: [0,0,0,0]\n\nRow3: [2,2,0,0]\n\nBut looking at the training examples, this structure doesn't match. For instance, Example0's output rows have different patterns. However, this approach produces a possible output. But I'm not sure if this aligns with the training examples.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output rows are the logical AND of the upper and lower rows, where 3 and1 become2, else0.\n\nFor test input's row0 (upper) and row4 (lower):\n\n0&0 \u21920,3&0\u21920,0&1\u21920,3&1\u21922. So output row0: [0,0,0,2].\n\nBut this doesn't match the earlier hypothesis.\n\nThis is taking too long, and I need to provide an answer. Given the complexity, I'll proceed with the per-column rule that if there's at least one3 in upper and exactly two1s in lower, output2, else0. Then, the test input's columns1-3 meet this, so output rows would have 2s in those columns. But since outputs have four rows, perhaps each column's value is duplicated across all rows, but the training examples don't show that. Alternatively, the output is a single row, but the training examples have multiple rows.\n\nWait, no. The training examples' outputs are four rows. For instance, Example0's output has four rows. So the per-column approach may not be correct. \n\nAnother last-ditch attempt: perhaps the output is determined by the sum of each pair of rows (upper and lower) where 3 and1 in the same column sum to2. For example, 3 in upper and 1 in lower sum to4, which modulo2 is0. But this doesn't explain 2.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps 3 is treated as1, and 1 as1, other numbers as0. Then, for each pair of upper and lower rows, their sum modulo something. But this seems off.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is a 4x4 grid where each cell is 2 if the sum of the corresponding upper and lower cells is4 (3+1), else0. Let's test this.\n\nFor the test input's upper row0 and lower row4:\n\n0+0=0 \u21920.\n\n3+0=3 \u21920.\n\n0+1=1 \u21920.\n\n3+1=4 \u21922.\n\nSo output row0: [0,0,0,2].\n\nRow1: upper row1 and lower row5.\n\n3+0=3\u21920.\n\n3+0=3\u21920.\n\n3+1=4\u21922.\n\n0+1=1\u21920.\n\nOutput row1: [0,0,2,0].\n\nRow2: upper row2 and lower row6.\n\n0+0=0.\n\n0+1=1.\n\n0+0=0.\n\n3+0=3.\n\nOutput row2: [0,0,0,0].\n\nRow3: upper row3 and lower row7.\n\n3+1=4\u21922.\n\n3+1=4\u21922.\n\n3+0=3\u21920.\n\n0+0=0\u21920.\n\nOutput row3: [2,2,0,0].\n\nCombining these, the output would be:\n\n[0,0,0,2]\n\n[0,0,2,0]\n\n[0,0,0,0]\n\n[2,2,0,0]\n\nLooking at the training examples, this pattern seems plausible. For Example0's first output row [2,2,2,0], let's check:\n\nUpper row0 [0,0,0,0] + lower row4 [0,0,0,1] \u2192 no 3+1 pairs.\n\nBut output row0 is [2,2,2,0]. So this doesn't fit. Hence, this rule is incorrect.\n\nGiven that I'm out of time and need to provide an answer, I'll make a guess based on the earlier per-column hypothesis, even though it doesn't fit all examples. For the test input, columns1,2,3 have exactly two 1s in lower and 3s in upper. So output would have 2s in those columns. But how to arrange this into four rows. Perhaps the output is four rows, each with 2s in those columns. But training examples don't do this. Alternatively, the output is a single row, but examples have four. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is determined by the number of 3-1 pairs across all pairs of upper and lower rows. For example, for each column, count the number of upper rows with3 and lower rows with1. If the count is even, output2. Else0.\n\nFor the test input column1:\n\nUpper has 3s in rows0,1,3 \u21923 occurrences.\n\nLower has 1s in rows6,7 \u21922 occurrences.\n\n3*2=6 pairs. Count is6. Even \u21922.\n\nSimilarly, column2 has3s in upper rows1,3, and lowers rows4,5 \u2192 2*2=4 \u2192 even \u21922.\n\nColumn3 has3s in rows0,2 and lowers rows4,5 \u21922*2=4 \u2192 even \u21922.\n\nSo output columns1-3 would be2. But how to distribute this into four rows. Since I can't figure it out, I'll guess the output is:\n\n[0,2,2,0]\n\n[0,0,0,0]\n\n[0,0,0,0]\n\n[0,0,0,0]\n\nBut this is a wild guess. Looking at Example1's output, which has similar 2s in some rows. But this is not reliable. \n\nBased on the test input's columns, I'll assume the output is:\n\n[0, 2, 2, 0]\n\n[0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n[0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n[0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nBut not confident. Alternatively, given the test input's upper rows and lower rows, perhaps the output is:\n\n[0, 2, 2, 0]\n\n[0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n[0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n[0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nBut this is just a guess. I need to look for patterns in the examples. For example, in Example0's output, the first row has 2s where the upper rows have 3s and lower rows have 1s. But it's not clear.",

        "cot_2": "Okay, let's tackle this puzzle. So, we have these training examples where an input grid is transformed into an output grid. My job is to figure out the pattern and apply it to the test input. Let's start by looking at the examples one by one.\n\nLooking at Example 0's input and output. The input has 8 rows, and the output has 4 rows. So maybe the output is derived from processing the input in pairs. Let's see: the input is split into two parts? Like the first four rows and the next four rows? Or maybe each pair of rows contributes to the output? Let's check.\n\nWait, the output is 4 rows. The input has 8 rows. So perhaps each pair of input rows corresponds to one output row. Let's check Example 0:\n\nInput:\n[0, 0, 0, 0] (row 0)\n[0, 3, 3, 0] (row 1)\n[0, 0, 0, 0] (row 2)\n[3, 0, 0, 3] (row 3)\n[0, 0, 0, 1] (row 4)\n[1, 0, 1, 1] (row 5)\n[1, 1, 1, 1] (row 6)\n[0, 1, 0, 1] (row 7)\n\nOutput:\n[2, 2, 2, 0]\n[0, 0, 0, 0]\n[0, 0, 0, 0]\n[0, 0, 2, 0]\n\nHmm. Let's see if each output row is generated by combining two input rows. For example, maybe the first two input rows (0 and 1) form the first output row. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the input is divided into two groups of four rows each, and the output is generated by comparing or combining these groups. Let's look at the numbers. The output has 4 rows, which is half the input's 8. So perhaps each output row is derived from two input rows, one from the first four and one from the second four. For example, row 0 of the output could be based on input rows 0 and 4, row 1 on 1 and 5, etc. Let's check that.\n\nIn Example 0:\n\nOutput row 0: [2,2,2,0]\nInput row 0: [0,0,0,0]\nInput row 4: [0,0,0,1]\n\nWhat operation on these two rows gives [2,2,2,0]? Let's see. If we look at each position:\n\nFor column 0: input0 has 0, input4 has 0. How to get 2?\nSimilarly for columns 1-3: input0 is 0, input4 has 0,0,1. The output is 2,2,2,0. Hmm, that doesn't immediately make sense.\n\nAnother approach: Maybe the output is determined by the presence of 3s and 1s in the input. Let's look for where 3s and 1s are in the input and how they relate to the output's 2s and 0s.\n\nIn Example 0's output, the first row has three 2s. Looking at input rows 0 and 4 (assuming they are paired), input0 has all 0s except maybe the fourth row. Wait, input row 0 is [0,0,0,0], row 4 is [0,0,0,1]. So perhaps when a column in the first four rows has a 3 and the corresponding column in the next four rows has a 1, then output is 2. But in this case, row0 has no 3s. Wait, maybe it's the other way around.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for each column, if the sum of the first four rows in that column has a certain value, and the sum of the next four rows has another, leading to 2 or 0. Let's check.\n\nTake column 0 in Example 0. First four rows: rows 0-3 in column 0 are 0,0,0,3. Sum is 3. Next four rows (rows4-7) column0: 0,1,1,0. Sum is 2. Output is 2. How does 3 and 2 lead to 2? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's about the positions where 3s in the upper half and 1s in the lower half align. Let's check Example 0's first output row [2,2,2,0]. Let's see which columns in the upper half (first four rows) have 3s. For column 0: row1 (3?), no, row0 has 0, row1 has 0 in column0. Wait, input row1 is [0,3,3,0], so column0 is 0. So upper half's columns 0: 0,0,0,3 (from row3). So column0 in upper half has a 3 in row3. Lower half (rows4-7) column0: rows4 has 0, row5 has1, row6 has1, row7 has0. So in lower half column0, there are 1s in rows5 and6. Maybe the output is 2 when there's a 3 in the upper half and a 1 in the lower half in the same column. But let's check.\n\nIn Example0, output row0 is [2,2,2,0]. Let's look at each column:\n\nColumn0: upper rows (0-3) have 0,0,0,3. So in upper half, there's a 3 in row3. Lower half (rows4-7) column0: 0,1,1,0. So rows5 and6 (which are rows1 and2 in lower half) have 1s. So for output column0, 3 in upper and 1 in lower. So output is 2. Similarly for column1 and2. Column3 upper has 0 in upper except row3 has3. Lower half column3: row4 has1, row5 has1, row6 has1, row7 has1. So column3 upper has3 in row3, lower has 1s. But output column3 is 0. Hmm, that breaks the pattern. So maybe that's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is determined by the count of 3s in the upper four rows and 1s in the lower four rows. For each column, if the number of 3s in the upper four rows plus the number of 1s in the lower four rows meets a certain condition, then output 2, else 0.\n\nIn Example0's column0: upper four rows have one 3 (row3), lower four rows have two 1s. Sum is 3. Output is 2. Column1: upper rows have two 3s (row1's columns1 and2?), wait row1 is [0,3,3,0], so column1 and2 are 3s. Upper rows for column1: rows0 is0, row1 is3, row2 is0, row3 is0. So one 3. Lower rows column1: rows4 is0, row5 is0, row6 is1, row7 is1. So two 1s. Sum 1+2=3. Output is2. Column2: upper column2 has row1 has3, row3 has0. So two 3s (row1's column2 and 3?), no. Wait row1 is [0,3,3,0], so column2 is 3. Row2 is all 0. Row3's column2 is 0. So upper column2 has one 3. Lower column2: row4 has0, row5 has1, row6 has1, row7 has0. So two 1s. Sum 1+2=3. Output is2. Column3 upper: row3 has3. Lower column3: row4 has1, row5 has1, row6 has1, row7 has1. So sum 1 (3s) +4 (1s) =5. Output is0. So how does that fit? When sum is 3, output is 2. When sum is5, output is0. Maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, maybe if the upper has at least one 3 and the lower has at least one 1 in the same column, then output is 2. For column3 in Example0: upper has 3 (row3's column3), lower has four 1s. So according to this, output should be2. But the output is0. So that's conflicting.\n\nAnother angle: looking at the output grids. In Example0's output, the first row has three 2s. Let's see the corresponding input columns. Maybe it's about the vertical pairs. For example, each output cell is determined by the two cells in the same column from two different input rows. Wait, but how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is a 4x4 grid where each cell is derived from two input rows (maybe first and fifth, second and sixth, etc.). Let's check.\n\nIn Example0, output row0: [2,2,2,0]. Input row0 is [0,0,0,0], row4 is [0,0,0,1]. How do these combine? If in a column, row0 has 0 and row4 has 1, then output is 2? But in column3, row0 is0 and row4 is1, but output is0. So that doesn't fit. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is based on the presence of 3s and 1s in the same column across all input rows. For example, for each column, count the number of 3s in the first four rows and 1s in the last four rows. If both counts are positive, output 2; else 0.\n\nLet's test this for Example0's output:\n\nColumn0: first four rows (rows0-3) have 3 in row3. Last four rows (rows4-7) have 1s in rows5 and6. So both counts are positive. So output should be2. Which matches column0 of output row0 (assuming output row0 is column0 of the first four rows). Wait, maybe the output is per column, not row. Wait, the output is a grid. Maybe each output row corresponds to a pair of input rows. For example, output row0 is based on input row0 and row4.\n\nSo let's take output row0's columns:\n\nFor each column, if input row0 has a 3 and input row4 has a 1, then output 2. Otherwise 0.\n\nIn Example0:\n\nRow0 has all 0s. Row4 has [0,0,0,1]. So for column0: 0 and0 \u2192 0. But output is2. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, if either row has a 3 and the other has a 1. Wait, in this case, row0 has 0 and row4 has 1. So maybe if the upper row (row0) has a 3 and the lower (row4) has a 1, then 2. But row0 has 0 here. So that doesn't explain it.\n\nHmm. Let's look at another example. Example1's input and output.\n\nExample1's input:\n\nRows0-3:\n\n[3,3,3,3]\n[0,3,3,0]\n[0,0,3,3]\n[3,0,0,0]\n\nRows4-7:\n\n[0,0,0,1]\n[0,0,0,1]\n[0,1,0,0]\n[1,0,0,1]\n\nOutput:\n\n[0,0,0,0]\n[2,0,0,0]\n[2,0,0,0]\n[0,2,2,0]\n\nLooking at output row1 [2,0,0,0]. Suppose this corresponds to input row1 (row1: [0,3,3,0]) and row5 (row5: [0,0,0,1]). So for each column in row1 and row5:\n\nColumn0: 0 (row1) and 0 (row5) \u2192 0. But output is2. Hmm. Doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe output is derived from combining two rows in the upper and lower halves. For example, row0 of output is upper row0 and lower row0 (input rows0 and4). Let's check.\n\nExample1's output row0: [0,0,0,0]. Input row0 is [3,3,3,3], row4 is [0,0,0,1]. For each column:\n\nColumn0:3 and0. Maybe if upper has 3 and lower has 1 \u2192 2? But here lower has0. So output is0. Which matches. Column1:3 and0 \u21920. Etc. So output row0 is all 0s.\n\nOutput row1: [2,0,0,0]. Upper row1 is [0,3,3,0], lower row5 is [0,0,0,1]. For each column:\n\nColumn0:0 and0 \u21920. But output is2. Hmm. Doesn't fit.\n\nWait, maybe the output row is determined by looking at the upper row and the lower row that is four rows apart. For example, row0 of output is based on upper row0 and lower row4, row1 on upper row1 and lower row5, etc.\n\nSo for Example1's output row1, which is [2,0,0,0], upper row1 is [0,3,3,0], lower row5 is [0,0,0,1]. Looking at their columns:\n\nColumn0: 0 and0 \u2192 output 2? No, but output is2 here. Hmm. That doesn't align. Unless there's a different rule.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's about whether the upper row has a 3 in that column and the lower row (four rows later) has a 1 in that column. If both, output 2. Otherwise 0.\n\nIn Example1's row1 (upper row1) column0 is0, lower row5 column0 is0. So output 0. But output row1 column0 is2. So that's not it.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the sum of the upper and lower rows' elements in the same column. For instance, if upper is 3 and lower is 1, sum is4. Maybe sum equals 4 \u2192 output 2. Else 0. Let's check Example0's first row.\n\nExample0's output row0 column0 is2. Upper row0 (input row0) column0 is0, lower row4 column0 is0. Sum is0. So that doesn't fit. So maybe not sum.\n\nAnother approach: Let's look for the 2s in the output and see where they come from. For Example0's output:\n\nFirst row has [2,2,2,0]. Let's check the input rows. Maybe the 3s in the upper half and 1s in the lower half in the same column. For column0:\n\nUpper rows (0-3) in column0: 0,0,0,3. So there is a 3. Lower rows (4-7) in column0: 0,1,1,0. So there are 1s. So the column has at least one 3 in upper and at least one 1 in lower \u2192 output 2. Similarly for columns1 and2. Column3 upper has 3 (row3, column3 is3?), let me check input row3 of Example0: [3,0,0,3]. So column3 has3. Lower column3: rows4-7 are 1,1,1,1. So yes, 3 and 1s. But output column3 is0. So why? That breaks the pattern.\n\nWait, maybe the 3 in upper must be in the same row as the 1 in lower. Or perhaps in the same position when the rows are paired.\n\nAlternatively, for each column, check each pair of upper and lower rows. For example, in column0 of upper row0 (0) and lower row4 (0), maybe if upper has3 and lower has1 \u2192 2. But in Example0's output row0, column0 is2, but upper row0 (0) has0. So that's conflicting.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is the count of positions where a 3 in the upper half and a 1 in the lower half are in the same column across all rows. But that would give a number, not a grid.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each output cell is 2 if, in that column, there's a 3 in any of the first four rows and a 1 in any of the last four rows. But then in Example0's column3, upper has3 (row3) and lower has four 1s. So output should be2. But in the output, it's0. So that's a problem.\n\nWait, in Example0's output, the last column of the first row is0. So why isn't that a2? Let's see the input. Upper rows (0-3) in column3: row0 is0, row1 is0, row2 is0, row3 is3. Lower rows (4-7) column3: 1,1,1,1. So yes, 3 in upper and 1s in lower. But output is0. So that contradicts the previous hypothesis.\n\nHmm. Maybe the output is only looking at specific pairs of rows. For example, output row0 is determined by upper row0 and lower row4, output row1 by upper row1 and lower row5, etc. Let's check Example0's output row0 again.\n\nOutput row0: [2,2,2,0]. Upper row0: [0,0,0,0], lower row4: [0,0,0,1]. How to get 2s here?\n\nWait, maybe if in a column, the upper row has a 3 and the lower row has a 1, then output 2. Else, 0. But upper row0 is all 0s, lower row4 is [0,0,0,1]. So column3 in upper is0 and lower is1. So output column3 would be0. Which matches. But how do the first three columns get 2s here?\n\nThis suggests that this isn't the rule. Maybe another approach: looking for 3s in the upper half and 1s in the lower half in the same column but not necessarily in the same row pair.\n\nWait, in Example0, column0 has a 3 in upper row3 and 1s in lower rows5 and6. So perhaps if there's at least one 3 in the upper half and at least one 1 in the lower half of the same column, then output 2. But in that case, column3 in Example0 should have 2, but output is0. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output counts the number of overlapping 3s and 1s in the same column across the upper and lower halves. For example, if upper has a 3 in a column and lower has a 1 in the same column, then the output is 2 for each such occurrence. But how that aggregates into the output grid.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is 2 in positions where the corresponding upper row's cell is 3 and the lower row's cell (four rows down) is 1. For example, upper row0 and lower row4. If upper has3 and lower has1 \u21922. Else 0. Let's check.\n\nExample0's output row0: [2,2,2,0]. Upper row0 is all 0s. Lower row4 is [0,0,0,1]. So no 3s in upper row0, so output row0 should be all 0s. But it's [2,2,2,0]. So this doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. Let's try looking at the other examples. Let's take Example2.\n\nInput for Example2:\n\nUpper rows (0-3):\n[0,3,3,0]\n[0,3,0,3]\n[0,0,3,0]\n[3,3,3,3]\n\nLower rows (4-7):\n[1,1,1,1]\n[1,1,0,0]\n[1,1,0,0]\n[0,1,1,0]\n\nOutput:\n[0,0,0,0]\n[0,0,2,0]\n[0,0,0,2]\n[0,0,0,0]\n\nLooking at output row1 [0,0,2,0]. Suppose this corresponds to upper row1 [0,3,0,3] and lower row5 [1,1,0,0]. For each column:\n\nColumn0: upper0 and lower5's column0:0 and1 \u2192 maybe 2? But output is0. Column1:3 and1 \u2192 output0. Column2:0 and0 \u21920. Column3:3 and0 \u21920. So that's not matching. So perhaps not.\n\nBut output row1's column2 is2. Let's see upper row1 column2 is0. Lower row5 column2 is0. So not sure.\n\nAnother thought: Maybe the output is a 4x4 grid where each cell (i,j) is determined by the number of times a 3 appears in the upper rows at column j and a 1 appears in the lower rows at column j, but only for certain row pairs. For example, if in column j, there's a 3 in upper row i and a 1 in lower row i, then output cell (i,j) is2. Otherwise 0.\n\nWait, let's check Example0's output. Output row0 is [2,2,2,0]. So for each column j in row0 of output:\n\nIf upper row0, column j is3 \u2192 no, upper row0 is all 0s. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternative idea: Maybe the output is the result of some kind of XOR operation between the upper and lower halves. But 3 and 1 are not binary. Or perhaps the numbers are treated modulo something.\n\nAlternatively, the 3 and 1 could be part of a binary encoding. 3 in binary is 11, 1 is 01. Maybe combining them gives a certain value. But it's unclear.\n\nWait, the output only has 0s and 2s. So 2 is a special case. Maybe 2 is a flag indicating a certain condition. Let's look at the test input and see if we can find a pattern.\n\nTest Input:\n\n[0,3,0,3] (row0)\n[3,3,3,0] (row1)\n[0,0,0,3] (row2)\n[3,3,3,0] (row3)\n[0,0,1,1] (row4)\n[0,0,1,1] (row5)\n[0,1,0,0] (row6)\n[1,1,0,0] (row7)\n\nWe need to apply the pattern from the examples to this input to get the output.\n\nSuppose the output is derived by looking at pairs of upper and lower rows. Let's try to hypothesize a rule that fits the training examples.\n\nLooking at Example0's output row3: [0,0,2,0]. It corresponds to upper row3 [3,0,0,3] and lower row7 [0,1,0,1]. For each column:\n\nColumn0:3 (upper) and0 (lower) \u2192 0.\nColumn1:0 (upper) and1 (lower) \u21922?\nColumn2:0 (upper) and0 (lower) \u21920.\nColumn3:3 (upper) and1 (lower) \u21922?\nBut output is [0,0,2,0]. Only column2 is2. So maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, maybe if upper row i has a3 in column j and lower row i has a1 in column j, then output row i's column j is2. Otherwise0.\n\nIn Example0's row3 upper is [3,0,0,3], lower row7 is [0,1,0,1]. So columns where upper has3 and lower has1 would be columns0 (3 and0 \u2192 no), column3 (3 and1 \u2192 yes). So output column3 should be2, but the output for row3 is [0,0,2,0], which has column2 as2. So that doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. Let's take another example. Example3's input:\n\nUpper rows:\n[3,3,3,3]\n[3,0,0,0]\n[3,0,3,3]\n[3,3,0,3]\n\nLower rows:\n[1,1,1,0]\n[0,1,1,1]\n[1,0,1,1]\n[0,1,1,1]\n\nOutput:\n[0,0,0,0]\n[0,0,0,0]\n[0,2,0,0]\n[0,0,0,0]\n\nLooking at output row2 (third row) which is [0,2,0,0]. This would correspond to upper row2 [3,0,3,3] and lower row6 [1,0,1,1]. Let's check columns:\n\nColumn0:3 and1 \u2192 output2?\nColumn1:0 and0 \u21920.\nColumn2:3 and1 \u21922?\nColumn3:3 and1 \u21922.\nBut output is [0,2,0,0]. So only column1 is2? That doesn't align. Wait, no. Output row2 is [0,2,0,0]. So column1 is2. Upper row2 column1 is0, lower row6 column1 is0. So why is output 2 here?\n\nThis is getting confusing. Let's try to find a different angle. Maybe the output is formed by the sum of 3s in upper rows and 1s in lower rows modulo some number. But in Example0's column0: upper has one 3, lower has two 1s. 1+2=3 \u2192 but output is2. Hmm, 3 mod something? 3 mod 1 is0. Doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's the product of the counts. 1*2=2. Which matches Example0's column0 output. Column1 upper has two 3s (rows1 and3?), lower has two 1s (rows6 and7). So 2*2=4 \u2192 output0? But output is2. Doesn't fit.\n\nAnother idea: Perhaps the output is the number of times a 3 appears in the upper four rows and a 1 appears in the lower four rows in the same column, but only if they are in the same row index modulo 4. For example, upper row0 and lower row0 (row4) must both have a 3 and 1 respectively. Or upper row1 and lower row1 (row5).\n\nLet's check Example0's output row0: [2,2,2,0]. If this row corresponds to upper row0 and lower row4. Upper row0 is all 0s. Lower row4 is [0,0,0,1]. So no 3s in upper. So output should be0. But the output is2s. So that's not it.\n\nExample1's output row1 is [2,0,0,0]. Upper row1 is [0,3,3,0], lower row5 is [0,0,0,1]. Columns0:0 and0 \u21920. But output is2. So this doesn't fit.\n\nWait, maybe it's about the sum of the upper and lower rows. If the sum is 4 (3+1), then output is2. Else0. Let's check:\n\nExample0's output row0 is derived from upper row0 and lower row4. Upper row0 is 0s, lower row4 is [0,0,0,1]. Sum for each column:0+0=0, 0+0=0, etc. So no 4s. Output is2s. So no.\n\nHmm. Let's try to look for a pattern in the output positions. For example, in Example0's output, the 2s are in the first three columns of row0 and column2 of row3. Let's see where 3s and 1s are in the input.\n\nIn row0 of output, 2s are in columns0,1,2. For the upper half (rows0-3) in column0: the 3 is in row3. Lower half (rows4-7) column0 has 1s in rows5 and6. Maybe if in a column, there's a 3 in any upper row and a 1 in any lower row, then output a 2 in the row corresponding to the upper row's index. But how?\n\nAlternatively, the output row corresponds to the upper row index. So for example, if upper row3 has a 3 in column0, and any lower row (rows4-7) has a 1 in column0, then output row3's column0 is2. But in Example0's output row3, column2 is2. Let's check upper row3 column2:0. Lower rows column2: rows5 has1, row6 has0, row7 has0. So there's a1 in row5. So why output row3's column2 is2?\n\nThis seems too vague.\n\nLet me think of another angle. The input has 8 rows, output has4. Maybe each output row is a combination of two input rows. For example, output row0 is input row0 + row4, but in some way. Looking at Example0's output row0: [2,2,2,0]. Input row0: [0,0,0,0]. Row4: [0,0,0,1]. How to get 2s from adding 0 and0? Unless there's a different operation.\n\nAlternatively, if input row0 and row4 are XORed. 0 XOR0 is0, but output is2. So no.\n\nWait, maybe 3 and 1 are being treated as flags. If in the same column, there's a 3 in any of the upper four rows and a 1 in any of the lower four rows, then the output's corresponding column is 2. But in Example0's column3, there is a3 in upper and 1s in lower, but output is0. So that can't be right.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's the number of pairs where upper has3 and lower has1 in the same column. For example, in column0 of Example0, there's one 3 in upper and two 1s in lower. So two pairs (row3 with row5 and row3 with row6). So sum is2 \u2192 output2. But how does this map to the output grid. Maybe output cell (i,j) is2 if the number of such pairs in column j is i+1? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the output is a 4x4 grid where each cell (i,j) is 2 if there's a 3 in row i, column j of the upper half and a 1 in row i, column j of the lower half. Otherwise 0. Let's test this.\n\nIn Example0's output row0, column0: upper row0, column0 is0. lower row4, column0 is0 \u2192 0. So output should be0. But output is2. So this doesn't fit.\n\nExample1's output row1, column0 is2. Upper row1, column0 is0. Lower row5, column0 is0. So again, not matching.\n\nHmm. Let's think about the output grids. They all have 2s in certain positions. Let's check if those positions correspond to where in the input's upper half there are 3s and in the lower half there are 1s, but only if they are in certain rows.\n\nFor Example0's output, the first row has three 2s. The upper rows for these columns have 3s in row1 (columns1 and2) and row3 (columns0 and3). The lower rows have 1s in rows5 (columns0 and2), row6 (columns0,1,2,3), row7 (columns1 and3). So maybe the 2s are in positions where a 3 is in an even row of the upper half and a 1 in an even row of the lower half. Or some pattern based on row parity.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by comparing the upper and lower halves in a certain way. For example, for each column, if the number of 3s in the upper half is equal to the number of 1s in the lower half, output 2. But in Example0's column0: upper has1 3, lower has2 1s. Not equal. Output is2. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAnother approach: Let's look for where the 2s are in the outputs and see if there's a pattern.\n\nIn Example0's output, the 2s are in row0 (columns0,1,2) and row3 (column2).\n\nIn Example1's output, 2s are in row1 (column0), row2 (column0), row3 (columns1,2).\n\nIn Example2's output, 2s are in row1 (column2), row2 (column3).\n\nIn Example3's output, 2s are in row2 (column1).\n\nHmm. Maybe the 2s are placed in the row corresponding to the number of 3s in the upper rows for that column, minus something. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is a 4x4 grid where each cell (i,j) is 2 if the sum of the ith upper row's jth element and ith lower row's jth element equals 4 (3+1). Otherwise 0.\n\nLet's test this:\n\nExample0's output row0, column0: upper row0's j=0 is0, lower row4's j=0 is0 \u21920. So output0. But output is2. Doesn't fit.\n\nExample1's output row1, column0: upper row1's j=0 is0, lower row5's j=0 is0 \u21920. Output is2. Again, no.\n\nThis approach isn't working. Let's try another angle. Maybe the output is based on the presence of 3s in the upper rows and 1s in the lower rows, but only in specific positions relative to each other.\n\nLooking at Example0's output row0: [2,2,2,0]. Maybe for each column j, if there's a 3 in the upper rows at j and a 1 in the lower rows at j, but the 3 is in an even row and the 1 is in an odd row (or vice versa). For example, upper row0 (even) has no 3s, but upper row1 (odd) has 3s in columns1 and2. Lower rows4 (even) has no 1s in column1 and2. Lower rows5 (odd) has 1 in column0. So maybe combining upper odd rows with lower even rows? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe for each column, the output row is determined by the number of 3s in the upper rows and 1s in the lower rows. For example, if there's exactly one 3 in upper and one 1 in lower, output is2. But in Example0's column0, upper has one 3, lower has two 1s \u2192 output is2. So that doesn't fit.\n\nThis is really challenging. Let's try to look for any other patterns.\n\nIn Example0's input, the upper rows are:\n\nRow0: all 0s.\n\nRow1: [0,3,3,0]\n\nRow2: all 0s.\n\nRow3: [3,0,0,3]\n\nLower rows:\n\nRow4: [0,0,0,1]\n\nRow5: [1,0,1,1]\n\nRow6: [1,1,1,1]\n\nRow7: [0,1,0,1]\n\nOutput:\n\nRow0: [2,2,2,0]\n\nRow1: [0,0,0,0]\n\nRow2: [0,0,0,0]\n\nRow3: [0,0,2,0]\n\nNotice that in output row0, the first three columns are2. Looking at the upper rows, row1 has 3s in columns1 and2. Row3 has 3s in columns0 and3. Lower rows have 1s in various places. Maybe the output counts the number of times a 3 in the upper rows is followed by a 1 in the lower rows in the same column, but in a shifted position.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is a transpose of some sort. Not sure.\n\nAnother idea: Maybe the output is a 4x4 grid where each cell (i,j) is 2 if the jth column in the upper half has at least one 3 and the jth column in the lower half has at least one 1, but only if the number of 3s in upper column j equals the number of 1s in lower column j. For example, in Example0's column0: upper has1 3, lower has2 1s \u2192 not equal \u2192 output0. But output row0, column0 is2. So that's not it.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output cell (i,j) is 2 if the upper row i has a 3 in column j and the lower row i has a 1 in column j. For example, output row0 column0 would be2 if upper row0 column0 is3 and lower row4 column0 is1. But in Example0, upper row0 has0, lower row4 has0 \u2192 output0. But output row0 column0 is2. So that's not it.\n\nThis is really frustrating. Maybe I should try to look for a different approach. Let's consider that the output might be the result of some kind of cellular automaton or a kernel convolution over the input. For example, each output cell is determined by its neighboring cells in the input. But given the examples, it's hard to see.\n\nWait, all the outputs are 4x4 grids. The input is 8x4. So each output row corresponds to two input rows. Maybe each output row is the result of combining two input rows (rows i and i+4) with some operation.\n\nLet me try this. For each output row i, combine input row i and input row i+4.\n\nIn Example0:\n\nOutput row0 is [2,2,2,0]. Input rows0 and4: [0,0,0,0] and [0,0,0,1]. What's the pattern here? If we subtract the lower row from the upper row: 0-0=0, 0-0=0, etc. Not helpful.\n\nIf we look for where the upper row has 3 and the lower row has1. But neither do. So maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, if the upper row has a3 and the lower row has a1, output 2. Else0. For Example0's row0 and4: no 3s or1s. So output should be0. But output is2. So no.\n\nAnother idea: Maybe 3s in the upper rows and 1s in the lower rows contribute to the output in a way that depends on their positions. For example, for each column, if there's a 3 in the upper rows and a 1 in the lower rows, then the output in the row corresponding to the upper row's index where the 3 was found. But how?\n\nFor example, in Example0's column0, the 3 is in upper row3. The lower rows have 1s in rows5 and6. So output row3's column0 would be2. But output row3's column0 is0, while column2 is2. So not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the output row is determined by the lower row's index. For instance, if a 1 is in lower row5, then output row1 (5-4=1) is affected. But this is getting too vague.\n\nLet's take a step back. The output grids have 2s in certain cells. Let's see if there's a pattern in the positions of these 2s.\n\nExample0's 2s are in row0 (0,0,0), columns0-2, and row3 column2.\n\nExample1's 2s are in row1, row2, row3 columns0,0,1,2.\n\nExample2's 2s are in row1 column2, row2 column3.\n\nExample3's 2 is in row2 column1.\n\nIt's possible that the 2s are placed in the output where the corresponding upper and lower rows have certain conditions. For example, output row i, column j is2 if the upper row i has a3 in column j and the lower row i+4 has a1 in column j. Let's test this.\n\nExample0's output row0, column0: upper row0 column0 is0, lower row4 column0 is0 \u2192 0. Output is2. Doesn't fit.\n\nExample1's output row1, column0: upper row1 column0 is0, lower row5 column0 is0 \u21920. Output is2. No.\n\nThis rule doesn't work.\n\nAlternative rule: Output row i, column j is2 if in the upper rows, column j has at least one 3 and in the lower rows, column j has at least one 1, but only in the row that is i+4. For example, output row0 would check lower row4. If upper row0 has a3 and lower row4 has a1 \u21922. But in Example0's upper row0 has0, lower row4 has1 in column3. So output column3 would be2, but it's0. So no.\n\nHmm. Maybe it's based on the parity of the row indices. For example, upper even rows (0,2) and lower even rows (4,6). Let's see:\n\nIn Example0's upper row0 (even) has0s. Lower row4 (even) has0,0,0,1. So no 3s and 1s in the same column. Upper row2 (even) has0s. Lower row6 (even) has1s. So column0 in row6 has1. But upper row2 has0. So output would be0. \n\nBut Example0's output row0 has2s. So this doesn't help.\n\nAnother angle: Looking at the sum of 3s in upper columns and 1s in lower columns. For each column j, sum_upper_j is the number of 3s in upper rows for column j. sum_lower_j is the number of 1s in lower rows for column j. If sum_upper_j >0 and sum_lower_j >0, then output 2 in the row corresponding to sum_upper_j -1. Not sure.\n\nExample0's column0: sum_upper_j=1 (row3), sum_lower_j=2 (rows5,6). So output row0? But output row0 column0 is2. But sum_upper_j=1 \u2192 row0? Not sure.\n\nThis is really challenging. Let's try to think of the output as a mask where 2s indicate certain conditions. For example, 2 could represent a case where a 3 is in the upper part and a 1 is in the lower part of the same column, but in a specific pattern.\n\nWait, in Example0's output row0, columns0-2 are2. The upper rows for these columns have 3s in row1 (columns1,2) and row3 (column0). The lower rows for these columns have 1s in row5 (column0), row6 (all columns), etc. So maybe for each column j, the output row i is2 if there exists a 3 in upper row i and a 1 in lower row i. But in Example0's output row0, upper row0 has0s. So that's not possible.\n\nAlternatively, output row i is2 for column j if upper row i has a3 and lower row (i+4) has a1. Let's check Example0:\n\nRow0 upper (0) and row4 lower. Upper row0 column0:0, lower row4 column0:0. No. So output0. But output row0 column0 is2. So no.\n\nExample1's output row1 is2 in column0. Upper row1 column0 is0, lower row5 column0 is0. Again, not matching.\n\nThis is not working. Let's think of another approach. Perhaps the output is determined by the number of 3-1 pairs in each column. For example, if a column has at least one 3 in the upper half and at least one 1 in the lower half, output 2 in that column's first occurrence. But how does that translate to rows?\n\nAlternatively, the output's row corresponds to the number of 3-1 pairs in that column. For example, if column j has two 3-1 pairs, output row1 (since 2-1=1?) Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the output row corresponds to the number of 3s in the upper half. For example, if a column has two 3s in the upper half, output row1 (since 2-1=1). But in Example0's column1, upper has one 3. Output row0 has2. Not matching.\n\nI'm stuck. Let's try to look at the test input and see if we can find a pattern there, then see if it fits the examples.\n\nTest Input:\n\nUpper rows:\n\n[0,3,0,3] (row0)\n\n[3,3,3,0] (row1)\n\n[0,0,0,3] (row2)\n\n[3,3,3,0] (row3)\n\nLower rows:\n\n[0,0,1,1] (row4)\n\n[0,0,1,1] (row5)\n\n[0,1,0,0] (row6)\n\n[1,1,0,0] (row7)\n\nIf the rule is that in each column, if there's a 3 in the upper half and a 1 in the lower half, output 2. Then, for each column:\n\nColumn0: upper has3 in rows1 and3. Lower has1s in row7. So output column0 should have2s. But where in the output rows?\n\nAlternatively, the output is a 4x4 grid where each cell (i,j) is2 if upper row i has a3 in column j and lower row i has a1 in column j. Let's apply this to the test input.\n\nFor example, output row0 would check upper row0 and lower row4:\n\nUpper row0: [0,3,0,3]\n\nLower row4: [0,0,1,1]\n\nFor each column j:\n\nColumn0:0 and0 \u21920.\n\nColumn1:3 and0 \u21920.\n\nColumn2:0 and1 \u21920.\n\nColumn3:3 and1 \u21922.\n\nSo output row0 would be [0,0,0,2].\n\nOutput row1: upper row1 [3,3,3,0] and lower row5 [0,0,1,1]:\n\nColumns0:3 and0 \u21920.\n\nColumn1:3 and0 \u21920.\n\nColumn2:3 and1 \u21922.\n\nColumn3:0 and1 \u21920.\n\nSo output row1: [0,0,2,0].\n\nOutput row2: upper row2 [0,0,0,3] and lower row6 [0,1,0,0]:\n\nColumns0:0 and0 \u21920.\n\nColumn1:0 and1 \u21920.\n\nColumn2:0 and0 \u21920.\n\nColumn3:3 and0 \u21920.\n\nOutput row2: [0,0,0,0].\n\nOutput row3: upper row3 [3,3,3,0] and lower row7 [1,1,0,0]:\n\nColumns0:3 and1 \u21922.\n\nColumn1:3 and1 \u21922.\n\nColumn2:3 and0 \u21920.\n\nColumn3:0 and0 \u21920.\n\nOutput row3: [2,2,0,0].\n\nSo the entire output would be:\n\n[0,0,0,2]\n\n[0,0,2,0]\n\n[0,0,0,0]\n\n[2,2,0,0]\n\nBut looking at the training examples, this doesn't match their patterns. For example, Example0's output row0 has 2s in columns0-2. According to this rule, that would require upper row0 and lower row4 to have 3s and 1s in those columns. But upper row0 has0s, so this rule wouldn't generate those 2s. So this rule doesn't fit the training examples. Therefore, this must not be the correct pattern.\n\nAnother observation: In all the training examples, the output grids have exactly 3 or 4 zeros and one or two 2s, except Example0's first row. But I'm not sure how this helps.\n\nLet me try to think of another approach. Maybe the output is the result of some mathematical operation between the upper and lower halves. For example, upper matrix minus lower matrix, but modulo some number. But in Example0, upper row0 is [0,0,0,0], lower row4 is [0,0,0,1]. 0-0=0, 0-0=0, etc. So output would be0. But output is2. So no.\n\nAlternatively, if 3 in the upper and 1 in the lower are considered as a pair, and the output counts the number of such pairs per column. But how would that form the output grid.\n\nAlternatively, the output is the count of 3-1 pairs in each column, placed in the row corresponding to the upper row's index. For example, if column j has a 3 in upper row i and a 1 in any lower row, then output row i, column j is incremented by 1. But since output cells are only 0 or 2, maybe each such pair contributes 2.\n\nIn Example0's column0:\n\nUpper row3 has3. Lower rows5 and6 have1. So output row3, column0 would be2*2=4, which is not possible. But output row3's column0 is0. So this is not correct.\n\nAlternatively, each pair contributes 1, and the output is twice the count. But in Example0's column0, there are two pairs (row3 with row5 and row6), so output would be4. Not possible.\n\nThis isn't working. Let's think differently. Maybe the output is determined by the position of 3s in the upper half and 1s in the lower half in the same column, but the row in the output corresponds to the number of 3s in that column's upper half. For example, if a column has two 3s in the upper half, the output for that column is in row2. But how does this fit?\n\nIn Example0's column0 has one 3 in the upper half. So output row0? But output row0's column0 is2. Maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, the output row corresponds to the number of 1s in the lower half's column. If a column has two 1s in the lower half, the output is in row2. But Example0's column0 has two 1s in lower, but output is in row0. Not matching.\n\nI'm really stuck here. Let's try to look for any other pattern.\n\nIn the test input's upper rows:\n\nRow0: [0,3,0,3]\n\nRow1: [3,3,3,0]\n\nRow2: [0,0,0,3]\n\nRow3: [3,3,3,0]\n\nLower rows:\n\nRow4: [0,0,1,1]\n\nRow5: [0,0,1,1]\n\nRow6: [0,1,0,0]\n\nRow7: [1,1,0,0]\n\nIf the rule is that output row i is 2 in column j if the upper row i has a3 in j and the lower row (i+4) has a1 in j.\n\nTest input row0 (upper) and row4 (lower):\n\nUpper row0: columns1 and3 have3s.\n\nLower row4: columns2 and3 have1s.\n\nSo for j=1: upper has3, lower has0 \u21920.\n\nj=3: upper has3, lower has1 \u21922.\n\nSo output row0 would be [0,0,0,2].\n\nRow1: upper row1 has3s in 0-2 columns. Lower row5 has1s in 2-3 columns. So for j=0:3 and0 \u21920.\n\nj=1:3 and0 \u21920.\n\nj=2:3 and1 \u21922.\n\nj=3:0 and1 \u21920.\n\nSo output row1: [0,0,2,0].\n\nRow2: upper row2 has3 in column3. Lower row6 has1 in column1. So no overlap. Output row2: [0,0,0,0].\n\nRow3: upper row3 has3s in columns0-2. Lower row7 has1s in columns0-1. So j=0:3 and1 \u21922.\n\nj=1:3 and1 \u21922.\n\nj=2:3 and0 \u21920.\n\nj=3:0 and0 \u21920.\n\nOutput row3: [2,2,0,0].\n\nSo the test output would be:\n\n[0,0,0,2]\n\n[0,0,2,0]\n\n[0,0,0,0]\n\n[2,2,0,0]\n\nBut looking back at the training examples, let's check if this rule fits. Take Example0's output row0: [2,2,2,0]. Upper row0 is [0,0,0,0], lower row4 is [0,0,0,1]. So according to this rule, j=3 would be2 (upper0 has0, lower4 has1 \u2192 no, upper0 has0. So output row0 would be all0s. But actual output is [2,2,2,0]. So this rule doesn't fit. Hence, this can't be the correct pattern.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and the lack of progress, I'll have to make an educated guess based on the test input and the training examples. \n\nLooking at the test input, upper rows have 3s in various columns, and lower rows have 1s in columns2 and3 (rows4 and5), columns1 (row6), and columns0 and1 (row7).\n\nIf the output is determined by the presence of 3s in the upper and 1s in the lower in the same column, but only in specific rows, perhaps the output rows correspond to the rows where the 3s in the upper and 1s in the lower are in the same row pair (i and i+4). For example, upper row1 has3 in column0, and lower row5 has1 in column2. No overlap. But upper row3 has3 in column0, and lower row7 has1 in column0. So output row3, column0 would be2. Similarly, upper row3 column1 has3, lower row7 column1 has1 \u2192 output2. \n\nSo applying this rule to the test input:\n\nRow3 upper has3s in columns0-2. Lower row7 has1s in columns0-1. So output row3 would have2s in columns0 and1. So output row3: [2,2,0,0].\n\nRow1 upper has3s in columns0-2. Lower row5 has1s in columns2-3. So only column2 has a3 in upper and1 in lower. Output row1, column2:2.\n\nRow0 upper has3s in columns1 and3. Lower row4 has1s in columns2 and3. So no overlap. So output row0: [0,0,0,0].\n\nRow2 upper has3 in column3. Lower row6 has1 in column1. No overlap. Output row2: [0,0,0,0].\n\nSo the test output would be:\n\n[0,0,0,0]\n\n[0,0,2,0]\n\n[0,0,0,0]\n\n[2,2,0,0]\n\nBut this doesn't match the earlier hypothetical output. However, looking back at the training examples, let's see if this pattern holds.\n\nTake Example0's output row3: [0,0,2,0]. Upper row3 has3s in columns0 and3. Lower row7 has1s in columns1 and3. So overlapping in column3. So output row3, column3 should be2. But the output is0. So this doesn't fit. Hence, the rule is invalid.\n\nGiven that I'm stuck, I'll have to make a best guess. Perhaps the output is formed by the following rule: For each pair of upper and lower rows (i and i+4), in each column j, output 2 if there's a3 in the upper row and a1 in the lower row, else0. This would create a 4-row output where each row corresponds to the pair of upper and lower rows. \n\nApplying this to the test input:\n\nRow0 (upper0 and lower4):\n\nUpper0: [0,3,0,3]\n\nLower4: [0,0,1,1]\n\nColumns:\n\n0:0 and0 \u21920\n\n1:3 and0 \u21920\n\n2:0 and1 \u21920\n\n3:3 and1 \u21922\n\nOutput row0: [0,0,0,2]\n\nRow1 (upper1 and lower5):\n\nUpper1: [3,3,3,0]\n\nLower5: [0,0,1,1]\n\nColumns:\n\n0:3 and0 \u21920\n\n1:3 and0 \u21920\n\n2:3 and1 \u21922\n\n3:0 and1 \u21920\n\nOutput row1: [0,0,2,0]\n\nRow2 (upper2 and lower6):\n\nUpper2: [0,0,0,3]\n\nLower6: [0,1,0,0]\n\nColumns:\n\n0:0 and0 \u21920\n\n1:0 and1 \u21920\n\n2:0 and0 \u21920\n\n3:3 and0 \u21920\n\nOutput row2: [0,0,0,0]\n\nRow3 (upper3 and lower7):\n\nUpper3: [3,3,3,0]\n\nLower7: [1,1,0,0]\n\nColumns:\n\n0:3 and1 \u21922\n\n1:3 and1 \u21922\n\n2:3 and0 \u21920\n\n3:0 and0 \u21920\n\nOutput row3: [2,2,0,0]\n\nSo the test output would be:\n\n[0,0,0,2]\n\n[0,0,2,0]\n\n[0,0,0,0]\n\n[2,2,0,0]\n\nLooking at the training examples, does this rule fit?\n\nExample0's output row0 would be based on upper0 and lower4:\n\nUpper0 all 0s, lower4 [0,0,0,1]. So output row0 would be [0,0,0,0]. But actual output is [2,2,2,0]. So this rule doesn't fit. Hence, it's incorrect.\n\nAt this point, given the time I've spent and the lack of progress, I'll have to make an educated guess based on the test input and the closest possible pattern I can find. Maybe the correct answer is:\n\n[0,0,0,0]\n\n[0,0,2,0]\n\n[0,0,0,0]\n\n[2,2,0,0]\n\nBut I'm not confident. Alternatively, perhaps the output is:\n\n[0,0,0,0]\n\n[0,0,2,0]\n\n[0,0,0,2]\n\n[0,0,0,0]\n\nBut I'm not sure. Based on Example1's output where similar patterns occur, maybe the answer is:\n\n[0,0,0,0]\n\n[0,0,2,0]\n\n[0,0,0,0]\n\n[2,0,0,0]\n\nBut I'm really not sure. Given the training examples, especially Example1 and Example2, the outputs often have 2s in the lower rows. For the test input, perhaps the output is:\n\n[0,0,0,0]\n\n[0,0,2,0]\n\n[0,0,0,0]\n\n[2,2,0,0]\n\nBut I'm not certain. Given the time I've spent, I'll proceed with this."
