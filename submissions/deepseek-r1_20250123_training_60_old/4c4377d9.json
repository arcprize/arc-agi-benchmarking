        "cot_1": "Okay, let's tackle this puzzle. So, I need to figure out the pattern that transforms the input lists into the output. Let me look at the training examples first.\n\nStarting with Example 0. The input has three lists:\n[9,9,5,9]\n[5,5,9,9]\n[9,5,9,9]\n\nThe output has six lists arranged in three pairs. The first three are:\n[9,5,9,9]\n[5,5,9,9]\n[9,9,5,9]\n\nThen the same three again. Wait, no, looking closer, the output is six lists. Let me check:\n\nOriginal output for Example 0:\n[9,5,9,9]\n[5,5,9,9]\n[9,9,5,9]\n[9,9,5,9]\n[5,5,9,9]\n[9,5,9,9]\n\nHmm, so the first three lists are a transformed version of the input, and then the next three are another set. Wait, maybe it's the original input transformed in some way, then reversed or something.\n\nLooking at the input and output. The input has three rows, the output has six. Let's see each input row in Example 0:\n\nOriginal input rows:\nRow0: [9,9,5,9]\nRow1: [5,5,9,9]\nRow2: [9,5,9,9]\n\nOutput rows:\nRow0: [9,5,9,9] \u2014 which is Row2 of input\nRow1: [5,5,9,9] \u2014 same as input Row1\nRow2: [9,9,5,9] \u2014 modified version of input Row0. Wait, original Row0 is [9,9,5,9], and the output row2 here is [9,9,5,9]. Wait, that's the same. Hmm, maybe not. Wait, no: input Row0 is [9,9,5,9], output row2 is [9,9,5,9]. So same as input Row0. Then the next three rows in the output are [9,9,5,9], [5,5,9,9], [9,5,9,9]. Which seems like the original input rows but in reverse order. Because original input rows are Row0, Row1, Row2. The output's first three are Row2, Row1, Row0? Let's check:\n\nOriginal input rows order: 0,1,2.\n\nOutput first three rows: [9,5,9,9] (Row2), [5,5,9,9] (Row1), [9,9,5,9] (Row0). So reversed order. Then the next three are again Row0, Row1, Row2 of the input? Wait, the next three in the output are [9,9,5,9] (Row0), [5,5,9,9] (Row1), [9,5,9,9] (Row2). So the output is [Row2, Row1, Row0, Row0, Row1, Row2]?\n\nWait, but the output has six rows. Let me check:\n\nExample0 output:\n\nRow0: Row2 of input\nRow1: Row1 of input\nRow2: Row0 of input\nRow3: Row0 of input\nRow4: Row1 of input\nRow5: Row2 of input\n\nWait, that seems to be the case. Let's check:\n\nOriginal input rows: 0,1,2 (indexes 0-2).\n\nOutput rows: 2,1,0,0,1,2. So the first three are reversed order of the input, then the next three are original order. So output is input reversed, followed by original input. So for three input rows, output is reversed input (3 rows) plus original input (3 rows), total 6 rows. But looking at the example 0's output:\n\nOriginal output:\n\n[9,5,9,9] (Row2 of input)\n[5,5,9,9] (Row1 of input)\n[9,9,5,9] (Row0 of input)\nThen:\n[9,9,5,9] (Row0 of input again)\n[5,5,9,9] (Row1 again)\n[9,5,9,9] (Row2 again)\n\nSo yes, that's exactly what's happening. The output is the reverse of the input rows followed by the original input rows. Wait, but in the output of Example0, the first three are the reversed input (Row2, Row1, Row0), then the next three are the original input (Row0, Row1, Row2). So the output is reversed input concatenated with original input. So for three input rows, output has six rows: first reversed order, then original order. Let me check other examples.\n\nExample1:\n\nInput:\n[4,1,1,4]\n[1,1,1,1]\n[4,4,4,1]\n\nOutput:\n[4,4,4,1] (Row2 of input)\n[1,1,1,1] (Row1)\n[4,1,1,4] (Row0)\nThen:\n[4,1,1,4] (Row0)\n[1,1,1,1] (Row1)\n[4,4,4,1] (Row2)\n\nYes, same pattern. So output is reversed input followed by original input. So for each input, the output is reversed list of the input's rows, then the original list. Then the total is 6 rows. So the pattern is: take the input's rows in reverse order, then append the original rows. So for example, if the input has 3 rows, the output is 3 reversed rows + 3 original rows = 6.\n\nTesting with Example2:\n\nInput rows:\n0: [9,4,9,4]\n1: [9,9,4,4]\n2: [4,4,4,4]\n\nReversed order would be 2,1,0.\n\nOutput first three rows:\n[4,4,4,4] (row2)\n[9,9,4,4] (row1)\n[9,4,9,4] (row0)\nThen original rows:\n[9,4,9,4] (row0)\n[9,9,4,4] (row1)\n[4,4,4,4] (row2)\n\nWhich matches the output. Similarly, Example3:\n\nInput rows:\n0: [3,3,5,5]\n1: [3,5,5,3]\n2: [5,5,3,3]\n\nReversed order is rows 2,1,0. Then original rows 0,1,2. The output is:\n\n[5,5,3,3] (row2)\n[3,5,5,3] (row1)\n[3,3,5,5] (row0)\nThen original:\n[3,3,5,5] (row0)\n[3,5,5,3] (row1)\n[5,5,3,3] (row2)\n\nYes, that fits. So the pattern is: the output is the input's rows reversed in order, followed by the original rows. So for the test input, which is:\n\nTest Input:\n[4,4,9,9]\n[4,4,4,4]\n[4,4,9,9]\n\nSo the input has three rows. Let's reverse their order. Original input rows are:\n\nRow0: [4,4,9,9]\nRow1: [4,4,4,4]\nRow2: [4,4,9,9]\n\nReversed order would be Row2, Row1, Row0. Then append the original rows. So the output should be:\n\nFirst three reversed rows:\n\nRow2: [4,4,9,9]\nRow1: [4,4,4,4]\nRow0: [4,4,9,9]\n\nWait, wait, because the original input's rows are:\n\nRow0: [4,4,9,9]\nRow1: [4,4,4,4]\nRow2: [4,4,9,9]\n\nReversed order is Row2, Row1, Row0. So the reversed part is:\n\n[4,4,9,9], [4,4,4,4], [4,4,9,9]\n\nThen the original rows are:\n\n[4,4,9,9], [4,4,4,4], [4,4,9,9]\n\nSo combining them, the output would be:\n\n[4,4,9,9]\n[4,4,4,4]\n[4,4,9,9]\n[4,4,9,9]\n[4,4,4,4]\n[4,4,9,9]\n\nWait, but looking at the original examples, when there are duplicate rows, the output still follows the same pattern. For example, in the Test Input, rows 0 and 2 are the same. So reversing them would still have rows 2,1,0, which are the same as rows 0,1,0 (since row2 is same as row0). Then the original rows would be rows0, row1, row2 (which is same as row0 again). So the output would be the reversed rows (row2, row1, row0) which is [4,4,9,9], [4,4,4,4], [4,4,9,9], then original rows [4,4,9,9], [4,4,4,4], [4,4,9,9]. So the entire output is six rows as per the pattern.\n\nSo the final answer should be:\n\n[4,4,9,9]\n[4,4,4,4]\n[4,4,9,9]\n[4,4,9,9]\n[4,4,4,4]\n[4,4,9,9]\n\nBut wait, in the training examples, the reversed rows are ordered as the reverse of the input. Let me confirm. For example, in Example0, the input rows are 0,1,2. Reversed is 2,1,0. So in the test case, input rows 0,1,2. Reversed is 2,1,0, which are [4,4,9,9] (row2), [4,4,4,4] (row1), [4,4,9,9] (row0). Wait, row0 is [4,4,9,9], row2 is [4,4,9,9]. So reversed order would be row2 (same as row0), row1, row0. So reversed part would be [4,4,9,9], [4,4,4,4], [4,4,9,9]. Then original part is [4,4,9,9], [4,4,4,4], [4,4,9,9]. So the output is exactly that. So the test case's output is the reversed list (row2, row1, row0) followed by original rows (row0, row1, row2). Since row0 and row2 are the same, the output would have two instances of [4,4,9,9] in the first three rows, followed by three rows again with the same as the original. So the final output would be as I mentioned.",

        "cot_2": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. So, looking at the training examples, each input is a list of three lists, and the output is a list of six lists. Let me see how the input rows are transformed into the output.\n\nStarting with Example 0:\n\nInput:\n[9, 9, 5, 9]\n[5, 5, 9, 9]\n[9, 5, 9, 9]\n\nOutput:\n[9, 5, 9, 9]\n[5, 5, 9, 9]\n[9, 9, 5, 9]\n[9, 9, 5, 9]\n[5, 5, 9, 9]\n[9, 5, 9, 9]\n\nHmm, so the output has six rows. Let's compare the input rows to the output. The input has three rows, and the output duplicates them but in some order. Let me list the order:\n\nOriginal input rows are row0, row1, row2. The output seems to be row2, row1, row0, then row0 again, row1 again, row2 again. Wait:\n\nWait, the output for example0 is:\n\n[9,5,9,9] (row2 from input)\n[5,5,9,9] (row1)\n[9,9,5,9] (row0)\nThen again:\n[9,9,5,9] (row0)\n[5,5,9,9] (row1)\n[9,5,9,9] (row2)\n\nSo the output is arranged as row2, row1, row0, then row0, row1, row2. Wait, no. Let me check:\n\nOriginal input rows:\n\nrow0: [9,9,5,9]\n\nrow1: [5,5,9,9]\n\nrow2: [9,5,9,9]\n\nOutput rows:\n\noutput0: [9,5,9,9] \u2192 row2\n\noutput1: [5,5,9,9] \u2192 row1\n\noutput2: [9,9,5,9] \u2192 row0\n\noutput3: same as row0 again\n\noutput4: row1 again\n\noutput5: row2 again\n\nWait, but in the output, the first three are row2, row1, row0. Then the next three are row0, row1, row2. So the output is the reverse of the input followed by the original input. So the first three rows are the input in reverse order, then the next three are the original input again. Let's check if this holds for other examples.\n\nExample1:\n\nInput rows:\n\nrow0: [4,1,1,4]\n\nrow1: [1,1,1,1]\n\nrow2: [4,4,4,1]\n\nOutput:\n\nFirst three rows: [4,4,4,1] (row2), [1,1,1,1] (row1), [4,1,1,4] (row0) \u2192 reversed.\n\nNext three: [4,1,1,4] (row0), [1,1,1,1] (row1), [4,4,4,1] (row2) \u2192 original order.\n\nYes, same pattern. So the output is the reverse of the input rows followed by the original input rows. So for each input of three rows, the output is six rows: first the reversed list of the input rows, then the original rows.\n\nWait, example2:\n\nInput:\n\n[9,4,9,4], [9,9,4,4], [4,4,4,4]\n\nOutput:\n\nFirst three: [4,4,4,4] (row2), [9,9,4,4] (row1), [9,4,9,4] (row0) \u2192 reversed.\n\nThen original rows: [9,4,9,4], [9,9,4,4], [4,4,4,4].\n\nYes, same pattern.\n\nExample3:\n\nInput rows:\n\n[3,3,5,5], [3,5,5,3], [5,5,3,3]\n\nOutput first three: [5,5,3,3] (row2), [3,5,5,3] (row1), [3,3,5,5] (row0) \u2192 reversed.\n\nThen original rows again.\n\nSo the pattern is clear: take the input's three rows in reverse order (row2, row1, row0), then append the original rows (row0, row1, row2), resulting in 6 rows total.\n\nWait, but in Example0, the output after reversing is row2, row1, row0, then the original rows row0, row1, row2. So the output is reversed input followed by original input. So the total is 3 reversed + 3 original = 6 rows.\n\nSo for the test input:\n\nTest Input:\n\n[4,4,9,9] (row0)\n\n[4,4,4,4] (row1)\n\n[4,4,9,9] (row2)\n\nWait, wait, the input is three rows. Let me note them correctly:\n\nInput rows are:\n\nrow0: [4,4,9,9]\n\nrow1: [4,4,4,4]\n\nrow2: [4,4,9,9]\n\nSo reversing the order would be row2, row1, row0.\n\nSo the first three rows of the output would be:\n\n[4,4,9,9] (row2), [4,4,4,4] (row1), [4,4,9,9] (row0)\n\nThen the original rows are row0, row1, row2: [4,4,9,9], [4,4,4,4], [4,4,9,9]\n\nSo the full output would be:\n\n[4,4,9,9]\n\n[4,4,4,4]\n\n[4,4,9,9]\n\n[4,4,9,9]\n\n[4,4,4,4]\n\n[4,4,9,9]\n\nWait, but looking at the test input's row0 and row2: they are the same. So when reversed, the first three rows would be row2 (same as row0), row1 (same), row0. Then original rows are row0, row1, row2 (same as row0). So the output would have some duplicates.\n\nBut according to the pattern, regardless of duplicates, the output is reversed input followed by original input.\n\nSo the output should be:\n\nFirst three reversed: row2 (same as row0), row1, row0 (since row0 is the original third in reversed order?), wait, wait. Let's clarify.\n\nOriginal input rows are:\n\nrow0: [4,4,9,9]\n\nrow1: [4,4,4,4]\n\nrow2: [4,4,9,9]\n\nSo the input is three rows. Reversed order would be row2, row1, row0.\n\nSo reversed rows are:\n\nrow2: [4,4,9,9]\n\nrow1: [4,4,4,4]\n\nrow0: [4,4,9,9]\n\nThen original rows are row0: [4,4,9,9], row1: [4,4,4,4], row2: [4,4,9,9]\n\nSo combining reversed and original gives:\n\n[4,4,9,9], [4,4,4,4], [4,4,9,9], [4,4,9,9], [4,4,4,4], [4,4,9,9]\n\nWhich matches the pattern. So the output should have the reversed input first (row2, row1, row0) then the original input (row0, row1, row2). \n\nSo that's the answer."
