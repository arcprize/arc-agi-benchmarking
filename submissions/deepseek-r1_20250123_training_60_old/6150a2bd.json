        "cot_1": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. So, looking at the training examples. Let's start with Example 0.\n\nThe input is three rows:\n[3, 3, 8]\n[3, 7, 0]\n[5, 0, 0]\n\nThe output is:\n[0, 0, 5]\n[0, 7, 3]\n[8, 3, 3]\n\nHmm, what's happening here. Let me compare each row. Let's see the first row of input is [3,3,8], and the output's first row is [0,0,5]. Wait, that doesn't look like a direct reversal. Wait, maybe looking at columns?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the matrix is being rotated or flipped. Let's check. If we reverse each row, then perhaps do something else. Let's take example 0:\n\nOriginal rows:\nRow1: 3,3,8\nRow2: 3,7,0\nRow3:5,0,0\n\nOutput rows:\nRow1:0,0,5\nRow2:0,7,3\nRow3:8,3,3\n\nWait, if I reverse each row of the input and then reverse the order of the rows. Let's test:\n\nInput rows reversed:\nRow1 reversed:8,3,3 \u2192 but output's last row is 8,3,3. Hmm. So maybe the entire matrix is rotated 180 degrees, which would be reversing each row and then reversing the order of the rows. Let's see.\n\nOriginal matrix:\n\n3 3 8\n3 7 0\n5 0 0\n\nReversed each row becomes:\n\n8,3,3\n0,7,3\n0,0,5\n\nThen reverse the order of the rows:\n\n0,0,5 \u2192 first row in output?\n0,7,3 \u2192 second row\n8,3,3 \u2192 third row. But the output's first row is [0,0,5], which matches. So yes, that seems to be the case. So the transformation is to reverse each row and then reverse the order of the rows. Let me check with Example 1.\n\nExample 1 input:\n\n5,5,2\n1,0,0\n0,0,0\n\nReversing each row:\n\n2,5,5\n0,0,1\n0,0,0\n\nThen reverse the order of the rows:\n\n0,0,0 \u2192 becomes third row in output? Wait the output is:\n\n[0, 0, 0]\n[0, 0, 1]\n[2,5,5]\n\nWait, no. Wait, after reversing each row, the rows become:\n\nRow1: 2,5,5\n\nRow2: 0,0,1 (original row2 was [1,0,0], reversed becomes [0,0,1])\n\nRow3: 0,0,0 (original row3 reversed is same)\n\nThen reverse the order of the rows: so original row3 becomes first in reversed order. So reversed rows would be:\n\nRow3: 0,0,0\n\nRow2: 0,0,1\n\nRow1:2,5,5\n\nWhich matches the output of Example 1. So yes, that's the pattern. So the process is:\n\n1. Reverse each individual row (so first element becomes last, etc.)\n2. Reverse the order of the rows (so the first row becomes the last, etc.)\n\nSo applying this to the test input.\n\nTest input:\n\n[6,3,5]\n[6,8,0]\n[4,0,0]\n\nStep 1: Reverse each row.\n\nFirst row reversed:5,3,6\n\nSecond row reversed:0,8,6\n\nThird row reversed:0,0,4\n\nNow, the matrix becomes:\n\n5 3 6\n\n0 8 6\n\n0 0 4\n\nThen step 2: Reverse the order of the rows. Original rows are:\n\nRow1:5,3,6\n\nRow2:0,8,6\n\nRow3:0,0,4\n\nReversed order of rows (row3 becomes first, row2 second, row1 third):\n\nRow1:0,0,4\n\nRow2:0,8,6\n\nRow3:5,3,6\n\nSo the output matrix should be:\n\n[0, 0, 4]\n\n[0, 8, 6]\n\n[5, 3, 6]\n\nLet me check if that's correct. Let's see, for the test input, that's the transformation. Then the answer would be as above.",

        "cot_2": "Okay, let's tackle this puzzle. So, we have these input and output matrices, and I need to figure out the pattern. Let's start by looking at the training examples.\n\nFirst, Example 0. The input is three rows:\n\n[3, 3, 8]\n[3, 7, 0]\n[5, 0, 0]\n\nAnd the output is:\n\n[0, 0, 5]\n[0, 7, 3]\n[8, 3, 3]\n\nHmm. Let me compare them. Let's see each row. The first input row becomes the third output row reversed. Wait, original first row is [3,3,8], and the output's third row is [8,3,3]. That's reversed. Similarly, the second input row is [3,7,0], and the output's second row is [0,7,3]. Also reversed. The third input row is [5,0,0], which becomes the first output row [0,0,5]. So it looks like each row is reversed and then the entire matrix is reversed in order. Like, reverse each row's elements, then reverse the order of the rows. Let me check that.\n\nOriginal input rows:\n\nRow 0: 3,3,8 \u2192 reversed \u2192 8,3,3 \u2192 becomes row 2 in output.\n\nRow 1: 3,7,0 \u2192 reversed \u2192 0,7,3 \u2192 becomes row 1 in output.\n\nRow 2:5,0,0 \u2192 reversed \u21920,0,5 \u2192 becomes row 0 in output.\n\nSo yes, if you reverse each individual row and then reverse the order of the rows, you get the output.\n\nLet's check Example 1 to confirm. Input:\n\n[5,5,2]\n[1,0,0]\n[0,0,0]\n\nReversing each row:\n\nRow 0: 2,5,5 \u2192 becomes row 2 in output.\n\nRow 1:0,0,1 \u2192 becomes row 1 in output.\n\nRow 2:0,0,0 \u2192 becomes row 0 in output.\n\nOutput is:\n\n[0,0,0]\n[0,0,1]\n[2,5,5]\n\nWhich matches. So the pattern is: reverse each row's elements, then reverse the order of the rows. So for the test input:\n\nTest input:\n\n[6,3,5]\n[6,8,0]\n[4,0,0]\n\nFirst step: reverse each row.\n\nRow 0: 5,3,6\n\nRow 1:0,8,6\n\nRow 2:0,0,4\n\nThen reverse the order of the rows. So the original row order is reversed. Original rows after reversal become row2, row1, row0.\n\nSo putting it together:\n\nReversed rows are:\n\n5,3,6 \u2192 becomes the third row of the output.\n\n0,8,6 \u2192 becomes the second row.\n\n0,0,4 \u2192 becomes the first row.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the original rows after reversing each row are:\n\nFirst reversed row (original row 0) is [5,3,6]\n\nOriginal row 1 reversed is [0,8,6]\n\nOriginal row 2 reversed is [0,0,4]\n\nNow, reverse the order of the rows. So the new row order is reversed. So the first row in the output is the reversed row 2 (original third row), then reversed row 1, then reversed row 0.\n\nSo output should be:\n\n[0,0,4]\n\n[0,8,6]\n\n[5,3,6]\n\nWait, but let me make sure. The original rows after reversing each are:\n\nRow0:5,3,6\n\nRow1:0,8,6\n\nRow2:0,0,4\n\nReversing the order of the rows means the output rows are row2, row1, row0 of the reversed rows. So:\n\nRow2 reversed \u2192 [0,0,4]\n\nRow1 reversed \u2192 [0,8,6]\n\nRow0 reversed \u2192 [5,3,6]\n\nSo the output matrix is:\n\n[0,0,4]\n\n[0,8,6]\n\n[5,3,6]\n\nBut looking at the example outputs, in example 0, the first row of input becomes the last row of output reversed. So applying the same logic here, the test input's reversed rows arranged in reverse order would give the output as:\n\nFirst output row is [0,0,4], then [0,8,6], then [5,3,6]. Let's check if that's correct.\n\nSo the final output should be:\n\n[0,0,4]\n\n[0,8,6]\n\n[5,3,6]\n\nWait, but let me check again. Let me take the test input:\n\nOriginal input:\n\nRow0:6,3,5 \u2192 reverse \u21925,3,6\n\nRow1:6,8,0 \u2192 reverse \u21920,8,6\n\nRow2:4,0,0 \u2192 reverse \u21920,0,4\n\nNow, reverse the order of the rows. So the new rows are row2 reversed (0,0,4), row1 reversed (0,8,6), row0 reversed (5,3,6). So combining them in order:\n\nOutput rows would be:\n\n[0,0,4]\n\n[0,8,6]\n\n[5,3,6]\n\nYes. So that's the pattern. Therefore, the test input's output should be as above."
