        "cot_1": "Okay, let's tackle this puzzle. So, we have these training examples where each input is a list of numbers, and the output is another list. The goal is to figure out the pattern that transforms the input into the output. Then, apply that pattern to the test input.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the first example. The input is [6,6,6,2] and the output is [2,6,6,6]. Hmm. It looks like the last element is moved to the front. Let me check the other rows in example 0. The second input row is [6,1,6,2], output [2,6,1,6]. Again, the last element (2) is first. Third input row [7,2,7,2] becomes [2,7,2,7]. Same pattern. Fourth input [1,7,2,2] \u2192 [2,2,7,1]. Wait, that's a bit different. The original last element is 2, but the output starts with 2, then 2, then 7, then 1. Wait, the original array is [1,7,2,2]. So moving the last element (2) to the front gives [2,1,7,2], but the output is [2,2,7,1]. Oh, maybe there's more to it than just moving the last element. Let me check again.\n\nLooking at the first example's input and output rows:\n\nInput: [6,6,6,2] \u2192 Output: [2,6,6,6] \u2192 So last element (2) moves to front.\n\nSecond row: [6,1,6,2] \u2192 [2,6,1,6]. Same as moving 2 to front.\n\nThird row: [7,2,7,2] \u2192 [2,7,2,7]. Again, last element 2 to front.\n\nFourth row: [1,7,2,2] \u2192 Output [2,2,7,1]. Here, the original array is [1,7,2,2]. Moving last element (2) to front would be [2,1,7,2], but the output is [2,2,7,1]. Wait, that's different. So maybe there's another step here. Let me see the differences. Original is [1,7,2,2]. Output is [2,2,7,1]. So after moving the last element (2) to front, maybe the remaining elements are reversed? Let's see: after moving 2 to front, we have [2,1,7,2]. Then reverse the rest [1,7,2] \u2192 [2,7,1], so the result is [2,2,7,1]. Oh, that works. So the process could be: move the last element to the front, then reverse the remaining elements.\n\nLet me test this with the first example. Input [6,6,6,2]. Move last element (2) to front: [2,6,6,6]. The remaining elements after the first are [6,6,6], which when reversed is the same. So the output is [2,6,6,6]. Which matches. Second example input [6,1,6,2] \u2192 move 2 to front: [2,6,1,6]. Then reverse the rest [6,1,6] \u2192 [6,1,6] (since it's the same as original). Wait, no. Wait, after moving 2 to front, the rest is [6,1,6]. Reversed would be [6,1,6], which is the same. So output is [2,6,1,6], which matches. Third example input [7,2,7,2] \u2192 move last 2 to front \u2192 [2,7,2,7]. Remaining elements [7,2,7], reversed is [7,2,7]. So output remains the same. Fourth example input [1,7,2,2] \u2192 move last 2 to front \u2192 [2,1,7,2]. Then reverse the rest [1,7,2] \u2192 [2,7,1], so the output is [2,2,7,1]. Yes, that matches.\n\nSo the pattern seems to be: for each row, take the last element and move it to the front, then reverse the remaining elements (the elements after the first position).\n\nLet's check the second training example to see if this holds. Take example 1.\n\nInput rows and outputs:\n\nFirst input row: [7,7,7,6,6,6,2] \u2192 Output [2,6,6,6,7,7,7]. Let's apply the pattern. Last element is 2. Move to front: [2,7,7,7,6,6,6]. Then reverse the remaining elements (7,7,7,6,6,6). Reversed would be 6,6,6,7,7,7. So the output becomes [2,6,6,6,7,7,7], which matches.\n\nSecond input row: [6,7,1,1,7,7,1] \u2192 Output [1,7,7,1,1,7,6]. Apply pattern: last element is 1. Move to front \u2192 [1,6,7,1,1,7,7]. Then reverse the remaining elements: [6,7,1,1,7,7]. Reversed is [7,7,1,1,7,6]. So the output would be [1,7,7,1,1,7,6]. Which matches.\n\nThird input row: [7,7,2,1,2,6,6] \u2192 Output [6,6,2,1,2,7,7]. Let's apply the steps. Last element is 6. Move to front \u2192 [6,7,7,2,1,2,6]. Reverse the remaining elements (7,7,2,1,2,6) \u2192 reversed is 6,2,1,2,7,7. So the output becomes [6,6,2,1,2,7,7]. Correct.\n\nFourth input row: [2,2,7,7,7,2,2] \u2192 Output [2,2,7,7,7,2,2]. Applying the steps: last element is 2. Move to front \u2192 [2,2,2,7,7,7,2]. Then reverse the remaining elements [2,2,7,7,7,2] \u2192 reversed is 2,7,7,7,2,2. So the output would be [2,2,7,7,7,2,2], which matches. Interesting, because the original and output are the same. But according to the steps, that's correct.\n\nAnother row: input [6,6,6,2,2,1,1] \u2192 output [1,1,2,2,6,6,6]. Let's see. Last element is 1. Move to front \u2192 [1,6,6,6,2,2,1]. Reverse remaining elements \u2192 [6,6,6,2,2,1] reversed is [1,2,2,6,6,6]. So output [1,1,2,2,6,6,6]. Correct.\n\nSo the pattern seems consistent. For each row in the input, take the last element, put it at the beginning, then reverse the rest of the elements (everything after the first element). \n\nNow, check example 2. Let's take the first input row: [1,2,7,1,1,1] \u2192 output [1,1,1,7,2,1]. Apply the steps. Last element is 1. Move to front \u2192 [1,1,2,7,1,1]. Then reverse the remaining elements [1,2,7,1,1] \u2192 reversed is [1,1,7,2,1]. So the output would be [1,1,1,7,2,1]. Correct.\n\nAnother row in example 2: input [2,1,7,7,2,6] \u2192 output [6,2,7,7,1,2]. Apply steps: last element is 6. Move to front \u2192 [6,2,1,7,7,2]. Reverse remaining elements [2,1,7,7,2] \u2192 reversed is [2,7,7,1,2]. So the output is [6,2,7,7,1,2]. Which matches.\n\nSo the pattern holds. Now, the test input is three rows:\n\nTest input:\n\n[7,6,1]\n[6,7,6]\n[6,2,2]\n\nLet's apply the pattern to each row.\n\nFirst row: [7,6,1]. Last element is 1. Move to front \u2192 [1,7,6]. Then reverse the remaining elements (7,6) \u2192 [6,7]. So the output row is [1,6,7].\n\nWait, but the output format in the examples is a list. So the first test input row would become [1,6,7]? Let's check with the training examples. For example, the first row in example 0, original length 4, output length 4. So the same applies here. Let me process each row:\n\nTest input first row: [7,6,1]. Last element is 1. Move to front \u2192 [1,7,6]. Then reverse the remaining elements (7 and 6) \u2192 [6,7]. So the entire output row becomes [1,6,7]. \n\nSecond row: [6,7,6]. Last element is 6. Move to front \u2192 [6,6,7]. Reverse remaining elements (6,7) \u2192 [7,6]. So output is [6,7,6]. Wait, but the original was [6,7,6]. Let's see: moving last 6 to front gives [6,6,7]. Then reverse the rest [6,7] \u2192 [7,6]. So the output is [6,7,6]. But that's the same as the input. But looking at the training examples, in example 1, the fourth row input [2,2,7,7,7,2,2] became the same in output. So this is possible.\n\nThird row: [6,2,2]. Last element is 2. Move to front \u2192 [2,6,2]. Then reverse the remaining elements [6,2] \u2192 [2,6]. So output becomes [2,2,6].\n\nPutting it all together, the test input's output should be:\n\n[1,6,7]\n[6,7,6]\n[2,2,6]\n\nBut wait, let me check again. Let's take each test row step by step.\n\nFirst test input row: [7,6,1]\n\nStep 1: Move last element (1) to front \u2192 [1,7,6]\n\nStep 2: Reverse the remaining elements after the first. Remaining elements are [7,6]. Reversed \u2192 [6,7]. So the new array is [1,6,7]. Correct.\n\nSecond test input row: [6,7,6]\n\nStep 1: Move last element (6) to front \u2192 [6,6,7]\n\nStep 2: Reverse the remaining elements [6,7] \u2192 [7,6]. So new array is [6,7,6]. Which is the same as the original. But according to the pattern, that's correct.\n\nThird test input row: [6,2,2]\n\nStep 1: Move last element (2) to front \u2192 [2,6,2]\n\nStep 2: Reverse the remaining elements [6,2] \u2192 [2,6]. So new array is [2,2,6].\n\nSo the output should be:\n\n[1,6,7]\n\n[6,7,6]\n\n[2,2,6]\n\nBut wait, looking at the training outputs, the rows are written with the same number of elements as the input. So for the test input, each row is length 3. The outputs in the examples have the same number of elements. So the answer should be as above.\n\nNow, let me check if there's any other possible pattern. For instance, maybe there's a rotation or other operations, but according to the examples, the pattern holds. So I think this is correct.",

        "cot_2": "Okay, let's see. I need to figure out the pattern that transforms the input lists into the output lists based on the training examples. Let me look at each example step by step.\n\nStarting with Example 0:\n\nInput:\n[6, 6, 6, 2]\n[6, 1, 6, 2]\n[7, 2, 7, 2]\n[1, 7, 2, 2]\n\nOutput:\n[2, 6, 6, 6]\n[2, 6, 1, 6]\n[2, 7, 2, 7]\n[2, 2, 7, 1]\n\nHmm, looking at the first input row [6,6,6,2] becomes [2,6,6,6]. The 2 moved from the end to the start. Similarly, the second row [6,1,6,2] becomes [2,6,1,6]. Again, the last element (2) is now first. Third row [7,2,7,2] becomes [2,7,2,7]. Same pattern here. Fourth row [1,7,2,2] becomes [2,2,7,1]. Wait, here the last element is 2, so moving it to front gives [2, ...], then the remaining elements are [1,7,2] which in output is [2,7,1]. Wait, maybe it's a rotation? Let me check. \n\nOriginal: [1,7,2,2] \u2192 Output: [2,2,7,1]. The last element is 2, moving to front, then the first three elements are reversed? Wait original first three were 1,7,2. After moving last element 2 to front, the remaining elements would be 1,7,2, but in output they are 2,7,1. Wait that's 1,7,2 reversed \u2192 2,7,1. So maybe after moving the last element to the front, reverse the remaining elements? Let's test this.\n\nTake first example input row: [6,6,6,2]. Move last element (2) to front \u2192 [2,6,6,6]. The remaining elements (6,6,6) when reversed are same. So output matches. Second input row: [6,1,6,2] \u2192 move 2 to front \u2192 [2,6,1,6]. The remaining elements [6,1,6] reversed would be [6,1,6], same as original. Wait, but in the output it's [2,6,1,6], which is exactly that. So that works. Third input row: [7,2,7,2] \u2192 move last 2 to front \u2192 [2,7,2,7]. Remaining elements [7,2,7] reversed \u2192 [7,2,7]. So output is [2,7,2,7], which matches. Fourth input row: [1,7,2,2]. Move last 2 to front \u2192 [2,1,7,2]. Then reverse the remaining elements [1,7,2] \u2192 [2,7,1]. So the output would be [2,2,7,1], which matches. So the pattern seems to be: take the last element, move it to the front, then reverse the remaining elements. Wait, but in the first example, the remaining elements after moving last to front are [6,6,6], reversed is same. So that's why output is [2,6,6,6]. So yes, that seems to fit.\n\nLet's check Example 1 to see if this holds.\n\nExample 1 input:\n\n[7,7,7,6,6,6,2]\n[6,7,1,1,7,7,1]\n[7,7,2,1,2,6,6]\n[2,2,7,7,7,2,2]\n[7,2,7,1,2,7,2]\n[6,6,6,2,2,1,1]\n[6,2,6,6,6,6,6]\n\nOutput:\n\n[2,6,6,6,7,7,7]\n[1,7,7,1,1,7,6]\n[6,6,2,1,2,7,7]\n[2,2,7,7,7,2,2]\n[2,7,2,1,7,2,7]\n[1,1,2,2,6,6,6]\n[6,6,6,6,6,2,6]\n\nLet's take the first input row [7,7,7,6,6,6,2]. According to the pattern: move last element (2) to front \u2192 [2,7,7,7,6,6,6]. Then reverse the remaining elements (7,7,7,6,6,6) \u2192 reversed would be 6,6,6,7,7,7. So the output should be [2,6,6,6,7,7,7], which matches the first output row. Correct.\n\nSecond input row: [6,7,1,1,7,7,1]. Last element is 1. Move to front \u2192 [1,6,7,1,1,7,7]. Then reverse the remaining elements (6,7,1,1,7,7) \u2192 reversed is 7,7,1,1,7,6. So the output should be [1,7,7,1,1,7,6], which matches the output. Correct.\n\nThird input row: [7,7,2,1,2,6,6]. Last element is 6. Move to front \u2192 [6,7,7,2,1,2,6]. Then reverse remaining elements (7,7,2,1,2,6) \u2192 reversed is 6,2,1,2,7,7. So output becomes [6,6,2,1,2,7,7], which matches. Correct.\n\nFourth input row is [2,2,7,7,7,2,2]. Last element is 2. Move to front \u2192 [2,2,2,7,7,7,2]. Then reverse remaining elements (2,2,7,7,7,2) \u2192 reversed is 2,7,7,7,2,2. So output should be [2,2,7,7,7,2,2], which matches. So same as input. That makes sense because after moving the last 2 to front and reversing the rest, which were [2,2,7,7,7,2], reversed becomes [2,7,7,7,2,2]. So the entire output is [2,2,7,7,7,2,2], which is same as input. So that's correct.\n\nFifth input row: [7,2,7,1,2,7,2]. Last element 2. Move to front \u2192 [2,7,2,7,1,2,7]. Then reverse remaining elements (7,2,7,1,2,7) \u2192 reversed is 7,2,1,7,2,7. So the output becomes [2,7,2,1,7,2,7], which matches the output.\n\nSixth input row: [6,6,6,2,2,1,1]. Last element is 1. Move to front \u2192 [1,6,6,6,2,2,1]. Reverse remaining elements (6,6,6,2,2,1) \u2192 reversed is 1,2,2,6,6,6. So output is [1,1,2,2,6,6,6], which matches.\n\nSeventh input row: [6,2,6,6,6,6,6]. Last element 6. Move to front \u2192 [6,6,2,6,6,6,6]. Reverse remaining elements (6,2,6,6,6,6) \u2192 reversed is 6,6,6,6,2,6. So output becomes [6,6,6,6,6,2,6], which matches.\n\nSo the pattern holds for all examples in Example 1. Now check Example 2.\n\nExample 2 Input:\n\n[1,2,7,1,1,1]\n[2,1,7,7,2,6]\n[2,1,2,6,2,1]\n[1,2,1,7,6,2]\n[2,7,1,2,7,1]\n[2,1,6,2,7,7]\n\nOutput:\n\n[1,1,1,7,2,1]\n[6,2,7,7,1,2]\n[1,2,6,2,1,2]\n[2,6,7,1,2,1]\n[1,7,2,1,7,2]\n[7,7,2,6,1,2]\n\nLet's check first input row: [1,2,7,1,1,1]. Last element is 1. Move to front \u2192 [1,1,2,7,1,1]. Reverse remaining elements (1,2,7,1,1) \u2192 reversed is 1,1,7,2,1. So the output should be [1,1,1,7,2,1], which matches.\n\nSecond input row: [2,1,7,7,2,6]. Last element is 6. Move to front \u2192 [6,2,1,7,7,2]. Reverse remaining elements (2,1,7,7,2) \u2192 reversed is 2,7,7,1,2. So output becomes [6,2,7,7,1,2], which matches.\n\nThird input row: [2,1,2,6,2,1]. Last element 1. Move to front \u2192 [1,2,1,2,6,2]. Reverse remaining elements (2,1,2,6,2) \u2192 reversed is 2,6,2,1,2. So output is [1,2,6,2,1,2], which matches.\n\nFourth input row: [1,2,1,7,6,2]. Last element 2. Move to front \u2192 [2,1,2,1,7,6]. Reverse remaining elements (1,2,1,7,6) \u2192 reversed is 6,7,1,2,1. So output becomes [2,6,7,1,2,1], which matches.\n\nFifth input row: [2,7,1,2,7,1]. Last element 1. Move to front \u2192 [1,2,7,1,2,7]. Reverse remaining elements (2,7,1,2,7) \u2192 reversed is 7,2,1,7,2. So output should be [1,7,2,1,7,2], which matches.\n\nSixth input row: [2,1,6,2,7,7]. Last element 7. Move to front \u2192 [7,2,1,6,2,7]. Reverse remaining elements (2,1,6,2,7) \u2192 reversed is 7,2,6,1,2. So output is [7,7,2,6,1,2], which matches.\n\nOkay, the pattern seems consistent across all examples. So the transformation is:\n\nFor each row (list), take the last element and move it to the front. Then reverse the order of the remaining elements (i.e., the elements that were originally before the last element, after moving the last to front, reverse those).\n\nWait, let me clarify. The steps are:\n\n1. Take the last element of the input list and move it to the first position.\n2. Then, take the remaining elements (the original elements except the last one) and reverse their order.\n3. Combine the moved last element with the reversed remaining elements to form the output list.\n\nSo for example, input list [a, b, c, d] becomes [d, a, b, c] after moving d to front. Then reverse the a, b, c part \u2192 [d, c, b, a]. Wait, but in Example 0, input [6,6,6,2], moving 2 to front gives [2,6,6,6]. Then the remaining elements (6,6,6) reversed is same, so output is [2,6,6,6]. Which matches.\n\nAnother example: input [1,7,2,2]. Last element is 2. Move to front: [2,1,7,2]. Then reverse the remaining elements (1,7,2) \u2192 [2,7,1]. So output is [2,2,7,1]. Which matches.\n\nSo the steps are: last element first, then reverse the rest of the elements (excluding the last element which was moved).\n\nSo the process is:\n\noutput = [last_element] + reversed(original_list[:-1])\n\nYes, that's the pattern.\n\nNow, applying this to the test input.\n\nTest Input:\n[7,6,1]\n[6,7,6]\n[6,2,2]\n\nLet's process each row.\n\nFirst row: [7,6,1]\n\nLast element is 1. Move to front: [1,7,6]. Then reverse the remaining elements (7,6) \u2192 [6,7]. So output is [1,6,7]. Wait, no. Wait, after moving last element (1) to front, the remaining elements are [7,6]. Reversing them gives [6,7]. So the output list is [1,6,7]. But wait, the original list length is 3. So moving the last element (1) to front gives [1,7,6]. Then reverse the remaining elements (7,6) \u2192 [6,7]. So the output is [1] followed by [6,7], making [1,6,7].\n\nBut let me check the example 0 where input is [6,6,6,2], output is [2,6,6,6]. So moving last element (2) to front gives [2,6,6,6], then the remaining elements (6,6,6) are reversed \u2192 same. So output is [2,6,6,6].\n\nSo for the first test input row [7,6,1], output should be [1,6,7]?\n\nWait, but in the training examples, when the original list has length 4, the output is [last] + reversed(original[:3]).\n\nSo for a 3-element list, the steps would be:\n\nTake last element (e.g., 1) \u2192 move to front. Then take the first two elements (original first two elements, which are 7,6) and reverse them to 6,7. So output is [1,6,7].\n\nSecond test row: [6,7,6]. Last element is 6. Move to front \u2192 [6,6,7]. Reverse the remaining elements [6,7] \u2192 [7,6]. So output is [6,7,6].\n\nWait, wait, the remaining elements after moving the last to front are the original first two elements. So original list is [6,7,6]. Moving last element (6) to front gives [6,6,7]. Then reverse the remaining elements (6,7) \u2192 [7,6]. So the output is [6,7,6]. But that's the same as the input. Hmm. Let's check the training examples. For example, in Example 1's fourth row [2,2,7,7,7,2,2], the output is same as input. Because after moving the last 2 to front and reversing the remaining elements, they end up the same. So in this case, moving the last element (6) to front gives [6,6,7]. Reverse the remaining [6,7] \u2192 [7,6]. So output is [6,7,6], which is the same as the input. So that's possible.\n\nThird test row: [6,2,2]. Last element is 2. Move to front \u2192 [2,6,2]. Reverse remaining elements [6,2] \u2192 [2,6]. So output is [2,2,6].\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nTest Output:\n\n[1, 6, 7]\n[6, 7, 6]\n[2, 2, 6]\n\nBut I need to format it like the training examples. The training outputs for Example 0 had each list as a separate line in square brackets, same for other examples. So the answer should be three lists in the same format."
