        "cot_1": "Okay, let's see. I need to figure out the pattern that transforms the input matrices into the output ones. Let's look at the training examples one by one.\n\nStarting with Example 0. The input is a 5x5 matrix. The first two rows are [8,8,0,0,0], then three rows of zeros. The output has the second and third rows as [2,2,0,0,0], surrounded by zeros. So, the 8s in the input turned into 2s in the output, but shifted down by one row. Wait, maybe. Original 8s were in row 0 and 1. Output has them in row 1 and 2. So each 8 moved down one row, but split into two rows? Or maybe there's a different logic.\n\nExample 1 is a 3x3 matrix. The input has an 8 in the top middle. The output has a 2 in the middle of the second row. So again, the 8 is one row up from the 2 in the output. So the 8 in row 0 becomes a 2 in row 1.\n\nExample 2's input is a 5x5 matrix with three 8s in the second row (indices 1). The output has those 8s converted to 2s but in the third row (index 2). So again, moving down by one row.\n\nSo the pattern seems to be: wherever there is an 8 in the input, the cell directly below it (same column, next row) in the output becomes a 2. Wait, but in Example 0, there are two rows of 8s. Let's check. Input's first two rows have 8s. The output's second row (row 1) and third row (row 2) have 2s. Hmm, maybe each 8 in row i, column j leads to a 2 in row i+1, column j. But in Example 0, the original 8s are in rows 0 and 1. So their 2s would be in rows 1 and 2, which matches the output. Similarly, in Example 1, the 8 is in row 0, column 1. The output's 2 is in row 1, column 1. Example 2's 8s are in row 1, so 2s are in row 2. That makes sense.\n\nBut wait, what if there are multiple 8s in adjacent rows? Like in the Test Input. Let's look at the Test Input:\n\nTest Input rows:\nRow 0: [0, 0, 8, 0, 0]\nRow 1: [0, 8, 8, 0, 0]\nRow 2: [0, 0, 8, 0, 0]\nRows 3 and 4 are zeros.\n\nSo applying the pattern: each 8 in row i results in a 2 in row i+1, same column. Let's process each 8:\n\nRow 0, column 2: 8 \u2192 2 in row 1, column 2.\nRow 1, columns 1 and 2: 8s \u2192 2s in row 2, columns 1 and 2.\nRow 2, column 2: 8 \u2192 2 in row 3, column 2.\nRows 3 and 4 would have no 8s, so nothing there.\n\nSo the output should have 2s in:\n\nRow 1, column 2 (from row 0's 8)\nRow 2, columns 1 and 2 (from row 1's 8s)\nRow 3, column 2 (from row 2's 8)\n\nBut let's check the training examples again. Wait, in Example 0, the input has two consecutive rows of 8s. The output has two consecutive rows of 2s. So each 8 in a row leads to a 2 in the next row. So overlapping is allowed. So in the Test Input, the 8s in row 1 (columns 1 and 2) would lead to 2s in row 2, columns 1 and 2. The 8 in row 0, column 2 would put a 2 in row 1, column 2. The 8 in row 2, column 2 would put a 2 in row 3, column 2.\n\nSo the output matrix would have:\n\nRow 1: [0, 0, 2, 0, 0] (from row 0's 8)\nRow 2: [0, 2, 2, 0, 0] (from row 1's 8s)\nRow 3: [0, 0, 2, 0, 0] (from row 2's 8)\nOther rows are zeros.\n\nBut looking at the training examples, the outputs don't accumulate. For example, Example 0's input has two rows of 8s, but the output's rows 1 and 2 are all 2s, but in the same columns. So perhaps each 8 in row i leads to a 2 in row i+1, same column, regardless of other 8s. So overlapping is allowed, and 2s can be in the same positions from different sources.\n\nIn the Test Input, let's map each 8:\n\nRow 0, col 2 \u2192 Row 1, col 2: 2\nRow 1, col 1 \u2192 Row 2, col 1: 2\nRow 1, col 2 \u2192 Row 2, col 2: 2\nRow 2, col 2 \u2192 Row 3, col 2: 2\n\nSo the output rows would be:\n\nRow 0: all 0\nRow 1: [0, 0, 2, 0, 0]\nRow 2: [0, 2, 2, 0, 0]\nRow 3: [0, 0, 2, 0, 0]\nRow 4: all 0\n\nBut let me check the training examples again. For example, in Example 2, the input has three 8s in row 1 (columns 1,2,3). The output has those as 2s in row 2. So each 8 is shifted down by one row, and the original row's 8s are replaced with 0s. So the output is generated by taking each 8 in the input and placing a 2 in the cell directly below, and all other cells are 0 (unless there are multiple 8s in the same column in adjacent rows, leading to overlapping 2s).\n\nSo applying that to the Test Input:\n\nOriginal 8s:\n\nRow 0, column 2 \u2192 2 in row 1, column 2.\n\nRow 1, columns 1 and 2 \u2192 2s in row 2, columns 1 and 2.\n\nRow 2, column 2 \u2192 2 in row 3, column 2.\n\nSo the output matrix would have:\n\nRow 1: [0, 0, 2, 0, 0]\n\nRow 2: [0, 2, 2, 0, 0]\n\nRow 3: [0, 0, 2, 0, 0]\n\nOther rows are 0. Let's see if this matches any of the training patterns.\n\nIn Example 1, the input's 8 is in row 0, column 1. The output's 2 is in row 1, column 1. So yes, exactly.\n\nSo the Test Input's output should be:\n\nRow 0: 0s\n\nRow 1: 0,0,2,0,0\n\nRow 2: 0,2,2,0,0\n\nRow 3: 0,0,2,0,0\n\nRow 4: 0s\n\nBut let me check if the training examples have any such overlapping. For instance, Example 0's input has two consecutive rows with 8s. So each 8 in row 0 would create 2s in row 1, and each 8 in row 1 would create 2s in row 2. The output of Example 0 is two rows of 2s. So yes, that's exactly what's happening. So overlapping is allowed, and 2s can be in the same position if the 8s are in adjacent rows.\n\nThus, the Test Input's output should be as I mapped above. Let's write that as the output matrix.",

        "cot_2": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. So, looking at the training examples, I need to see how the input transforms into the output. Let's go through each example one by one.\n\nStarting with Example 0. The input is a 5x5 grid. The first two rows have [8,8,0,0,0], then three rows of zeros. The output changes those first two 8s into 2s but shifts them down. The output's second and third rows are [2,2,0,0,0], and the rest are zeros. So maybe the 8s are moving down? But how exactly?\n\nIn Example 1, the input is a 3x3 grid. The 8 is in the first row, middle column. The output has a 2 in the second row, middle column. So the 8 moved down one row and turned into a 2. But why? Wait, maybe the 8s are moving down by one position and turning into 2s, and if there's another 8 adjacent, they stack? Wait, Example 0 had two 8s in the same row, and both turned into 2s in the next rows. Hmm.\n\nLooking at Example 2: The input has a row with three 8s. The output moves them down two rows? Because the original 8s are in the second row, and the output has them in the third row. Wait, no, in the input it's the second row (0-based index 1) with [0,8,8,8,0], and the output's third row (index 2) has [0,2,2,2,0]. So each 8 moves down one row, and becomes a 2. But wait, in Example 0, the first two rows of 8s became 2s in the second and third rows. Wait, the input for Example 0 has two rows of [8,8,0,0,0]. The output's second row (index 1) and third row (index 2) are [2,2,0,0,0]. Wait, but the input's first two rows are 8s. So each 8 is moving down by one row, but maybe when there are multiple 8s in adjacent rows, they stack? Or perhaps the 8s are \"falling\" down until they hit another 8 or the bottom.\n\nWait, let me think again. Maybe the pattern is that each 8 in the input is transformed into a 2 in the cell directly below it, provided that cell was originally 0. Then, any 8s that would move into a non-zero cell or out of bounds might stay? Or perhaps the 8s are moving down as much as possible, turning into 2s once they land. But how does that work with the examples?\n\nIn Example 0, the two rows of 8s. If each 8 moves down as far as possible, the first row's 8s would move down to the second row, but since the second row already has 8s, maybe they can't. So maybe the 8s in the first row drop down, but the second row's 8s can't drop further. Then in the output, those 8s are turned into 2s in the rows below where they were? Hmm, maybe not. Let's check the outputs.\n\nWait, the output of Example 0 has the 2s in rows 1 and 2 (since it's zero-based). The input had 8s in rows 0 and 1. So the 8s from row 0 move down to row 1 and 2? That doesn't make sense. Maybe each 8 is replaced by a 2 in the cell directly below it. But in Example 0, the first two rows are 8s. So the 8s in row 0 would turn into 2s in row 1. But the original row 1 also has 8s. So maybe the 8s in row 1 would turn into 2s in row 2. So the output rows 1 and 2 have 2s. That fits. So perhaps every 8 in the input grid is replaced by a 2 in the cell directly below it, but only if that cell is within the grid. If the 8 is in the last row, then maybe it disappears? Let's check the other examples.\n\nExample 1: The 8 is in row 0, column 1. The output has a 2 in row 1, column 1. So yes, moving down one row. That fits.\n\nExample 2: The 8s are in row 1 (second row if zero-based). The output's 2s are in row 2. So again, moving down one row. So the pattern seems to be that every 8 in the input is replaced by a 2 in the cell directly below it, regardless of what's there. Wait, but in Example 0, the input's row 1 also has 8s. So when we process those, their 2s would go to row 2. So the output rows 1 and 2 have 2s. So the transformation is: for every cell in the input grid, if it's an 8, then in the output grid, the cell directly below it becomes a 2. And the original 8s are turned to 0? Or perhaps the 8s are moved down and turned into 2s, and the original position becomes 0.\n\nWait, looking at the input and output of Example 0: The input has 8s in rows 0 and 1. The output has 2s in rows 1 and 2. So each 8 is transformed into a 2 in the row below. But the original rows 0 and 1 in the output are 0. So the 8s are effectively shifted down by one row and turned into 2s. So the rule is: for each cell (i,j), if the cell is 8, then the cell (i+1,j) in the output becomes 2. If there are multiple 8s above the same cell, they stack? For example, if two 8s are in consecutive rows, their 2s would be in the next rows. Let's test this with Example 0.\n\nInput rows 0 and 1 have 8s. So each 8 in row 0 becomes a 2 in row 1, and each 8 in row 1 becomes a 2 in row 2. So the output row 1 has 2s from the 8s in row 0, and output row 2 has 2s from the 8s in row 1. So that's why in Example 0, the output has 2s in rows 1 and 2.\n\nIn Example 1, the 8 is in row 0, so the 2 is in row 1. In Example 2, the 8s are in row 1, so the 2s are in row 2. That matches.\n\nSo the transformation is: every 8 in the input grid is replaced by a 2 in the cell directly below it. If there's an 8 in the last row, then it's replaced by 0 (since there's no row below). Also, if two 8s are stacked, like in Example 0's first two rows, their 2s would be placed in consecutive rows below.\n\nNow, applying this to the test input.\n\nThe test input is:\n\nRow 0: [0, 0, 8, 0, 0]\nRow 1: [0, 8, 8, 0, 0]\nRow 2: [0, 0, 8, 0, 0]\nRow 3: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\nRow 4: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nSo let's process each 8:\n\nRow 0, column 2: 8 \u2192 becomes 2 in row 1, column 2.\nRow 1, columns 1 and 2: 8s \u2192 become 2s in row 2, columns 1 and 2.\nRow 2, column 2: 8 \u2192 becomes 2 in row 3, column 2.\n\nSo the output should be:\n\nRow 0: all 0s (since original 8 in row 0's column 2 becomes 2 in row1)\nRow 1: has 2 in column 2 (from row0)\nRow 2: has 2s in columns 1 and 2 (from row1's 8s)\nRow 3: has 2 in column 2 (from row2's 8)\nRow 4: remains 0.\n\nWait, but let's check how the original examples handled overlapping. For example, in Example 0, the 8s in row0 and row1 both affect row1 and row2. So in the output, row1 has 2s from row0, row2 has 2s from row1. So multiple 8s can contribute to the same cell if they are directly above.\n\nIn the test case, row1 has 8s in columns1 and 2. So those would generate 2s in row2's columns1 and 2. Row0's 8 in column2 generates a 2 in row1's column2. Row2's 8 in column2 generates a 2 in row3's column2.\n\nSo the output grid would be:\n\nRow0: [0,0,0,0,0]\nRow1: [0,0,2,0,0] (from row0's column2)\nRow2: [0,2,2,0,0] (from row1's columns1 and 2)\nRow3: [0,0,2,0,0] (from row2's column2)\nRow4: [0,0,0,0,0]\n\nWait, but let's check. Let's create a grid and for each 8 in the input, add a 2 in the row below. So:\n\nOriginal 8 positions:\n\nTest input:\n\nRow0: (0,2)\nRow1: (1,1), (1,2)\nRow2: (2,2)\n\nSo each of these 8s will generate 2s in:\n\nRow1, col2 (from row0)\nRow2, col1 and col2 (from row1)\nRow3, col2 (from row2)\n\nThen, the output grid is initialized as all 0s, and then we add these 2s. So:\n\nRow1: [0,0,2,0,0]\nRow2: [0,2,2,0,0]\nRow3: [0,0,2,0,0]\n\nSo combining these, the output should be:\n\n[0,0,0,0,0]\n[0,0,2,0,0]\n[0,2,2,0,0]\n[0,0,2,0,0]\n[0,0,0,0,0]\n\nBut let me check the training examples again. In Example 1, the input's single 8 in row0 leads to a single 2 in row1. So that's correct.\n\nAnother check: if two 8s are in the same column in consecutive rows, their 2s would stack. For example, if there's an 8 in row0, col0 and row1, col0. Then row1's col0 would have a 2 from row0's 8, and row2's col0 would have a 2 from row1's 8. So each 8 moves down one row. That seems to fit.\n\nSo applying this to the test input, the output should have 2s in row1 col2, row2 cols1 and 2, and row3 col2. So the final output would be as I wrote above."
