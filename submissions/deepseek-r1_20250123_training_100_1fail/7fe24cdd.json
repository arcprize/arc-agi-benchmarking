        "cot_1": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. So, the input is a 3x3 grid of numbers (three rows each with three elements), and the output is a 6x6 grid. My job is to see how each input example transforms into the output and then apply that to the test case.\n\nLooking at Example 0:\n\nInput:\nRow 0: [8,5,0]\nRow 1: [8,5,3]\nRow 2: [0,3,2]\n\nOutput is a 6x6 grid. Let me look at the output rows. The first three rows of the output seem to correspond to the original rows. For instance, the first output row is [8,5,0,0,8,8]. It looks like the original row [8,5,0] followed by some elements. Then the next output row is [8,5,3,3,5,5], which is the original row 1 followed by something. The third output row is [0,3,2,2,3,0], which is row 2 of the input followed by elements. Then the next three rows of the output seem to be mirrored or transformed versions. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe the output is the original grid expanded by mirroring or reflecting in some way. Let's see. If the input is a 3x3, the output is 6x6. So perhaps it's creating a larger grid by combining the original with some reflections.\n\nAnother idea: the output is a combination of the original grid and its rotations or transformations. Let's check the structure. The first three rows might be the original rows with some appended elements, and the next three rows could be transformations. Alternatively, maybe it's arranged in a way that the output is a 3x3 grid mirrored both horizontally and vertically, but expanded to 6x6.\n\nAlternatively, the output could be the original grid concatenated with its mirror images. For example, each row in the first half is the original row plus its reverse or some modified reverse. Let's check example 0's first output row: [8,5,0,0,8,8]. The original row is [8,5,0]. The added part is [0,8,8]. Wait, maybe the last three elements are mirrored but with some changes. Let's see:\n\nOriginal row 0: [8,5,0]. The added elements are 0,8,8. The original third element is 0, then the first element 8, then maybe 8 again. Not sure. Let's see row 1 in output: [8,5,3,3,5,5]. Original row is [8,5,3]. Added elements are 3,5,5. The third element of original is 3, then the second element 5, then the second again? Maybe there's a pattern where after the original row, they append the last element, then the middle element, then the first element, but duplicated? Not sure.\n\nLooking at the third row of output in example 0: [0,3,2,2,3,0]. The original row is [0,3,2]. The added elements are 2,3,0. That's the reverse of the original row. So, original row followed by reversed row? But for the first row, original [8,5,0], reversed is [0,5,8], but the added part is [0,8,8], which doesn't match. Hmm. Maybe not a simple reverse.\n\nAnother approach: Maybe the output is arranged as the original 3x3 grid and then some transformed versions. But the output is 6 rows, each of 6 elements. So perhaps each row of the output is constructed by combining elements from the original rows in a certain way.\n\nLooking at Example 0's output:\n\nRow 0: [8,5,0,0,8,8] \u2192 original row 0 is [8,5,0], then 0,8,8.\n\nWhere do these numbers come from? 0 is the third element of row 0. 8 is the first element of row 0. Then another 8. Maybe the added part is the third element, then the first element, then the first again. Let's check row1 of output: [8,5,3,3,5,5]. The added elements are 3 (third element of row1), 5 (second element of row1), 5 again. Then row2: [0,3,2,2,3,0] added elements are 2 (third element), 3 (second), 0 (first). So the added part seems to be the third, second, first elements of the original row, but then repeated? For row0, third is 0, first is 8, then 8 again. But why the last two are 8,8 instead of 0,5,8 or something else.\n\nWait, maybe there's a different pattern. Let's see the entire output grid. For example, in example0, the output is 6 rows. Let's imagine that the first three rows are the original grid with each row extended, and the next three rows are some reflection.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is constructed by mirroring each row and column. For instance, the grid is expanded by reflecting each row and column to make a 6x6 grid. For a 3x3 grid, mirroring would create a 6x6 where the first three columns are the original and the next three are mirrored. But how?\n\nAlternatively, looking at the output rows, maybe each output row is the original row followed by a modified version. Let's take the first example output row for example0: [8,5,0,0,8,8]. The original row is [8,5,0], then the next three elements: 0,8,8. The third element of the original row is 0, then the first element (8) appears twice. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps each original row is followed by a transformed version where each element is derived from the original row. Let's take the first row of example0's input: [8,5,0]. The output row is [8,5,0,0,8,8]. The added elements are 0,8,8. So the fourth element is 0 (third element of original row), fifth is 8 (first element), sixth is 8 (first again). For the second output row: [8,5,3,3,5,5]. Added elements are 3 (third), 5 (second), 5 (second again). Third output row: [0,3,2,2,3,0]. Added elements: 2 (third), 3 (second), 0 (first). So the pattern here seems to be that after the original three elements, the next three are: third element of the original row, then first element, then first element again? Wait, for row0, original third is 0, first is 8. Then 0,8,8. For row1, third is 3, first is 8, but the added elements are 3,5,5. Wait, that doesn't fit. Row1's original is [8,5,3], so third element is 3, then the next elements are 3,5,5. So third, second, second. Hmm. So maybe the added part is [third, second, second]?\n\nBut in the third row, the original row is [0,3,2], added elements are 2,3,0. Which would be third (2), second (3), first (0). So here, it's third, second, first. So for row0, it's third, first, first. For row1, third, second, second. For row2, third, second, first. So that's inconsistent. Maybe there's another pattern.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the added elements are the reverse of the original row but modified. For row0 original [8,5,0], reverse is [0,5,8]. But the added elements are [0,8,8]. So first element of reverse is 0, then 8 instead of 5 and 8. Hmm. Maybe taking the reverse and then replacing the middle element with the first element. So reverse would be [0,5,8], then replace 5 with 8 \u2192 [0,8,8]. That fits for row0. For row1: original is [8,5,3], reverse is [3,5,8]. Replacing middle element (5) with the first element of the original (8) would give [3,8,8], but the added elements are [3,5,5]. Doesn't fit. So maybe that's not it.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the added elements are the third element, then the first element, then the sum or product. But 0, 8, 8: 0 is third, 8 is first, 8 again. Not sure. For row1, added elements are 3,5,5. Third element is 3, then 5 (second element?), then 5 again. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the added part is formed by taking the third element, then the element before it (second), then the first. But for row0: third is 0, second is 5, first is 8 \u2192 0,5,8. But the added elements are 0,8,8. Doesn't match. Hmm.\n\nThis approach might not be working. Let me look at the entire output structure. The output is 6 rows. Let's think of it as a 6x6 grid. Perhaps the original 3x3 is placed in the top-left, then some transformations in the other quadrants.\n\nAnother idea: The output could be a combination of the original matrix and its rotations. For instance, the original matrix, then rotated 180 degrees, etc. But the output is 6 rows, which is 3\u00d72. Maybe the output is arranged as original rows followed by transformed rows. Let's see.\n\nLooking at Example0's output:\n\nOriginal rows (first three rows):\n\n[8,5,0,0,8,8]\n[8,5,3,3,5,5]\n[0,3,2,2,3,0]\n\nThen the next three rows:\n\n[0,3,2,2,3,0]\n[5,5,3,3,5,8]\n[8,8,0,0,5,8]\n\nWait, the fourth row is the same as the third row of the first three. Then the fifth row [5,5,3,3,5,8] and sixth [8,8,0,0,5,8]. Not sure how that's generated.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is constructed by taking the original matrix and reflecting it along different axes. For example, the first three rows are the original matrix with each row extended, and the next three are the original matrix's columns reversed or something. Not sure.\n\nWait, let's check the output of example0's fourth row: [0,3,2,2,3,0]. That's the same as the third row of the first three. Then fifth row: [5,5,3,3,5,8]. Hmm. The first three elements are [5,5,3], then [3,5,8]. Not sure where those come from. The sixth row is [8,8,0,0,5,8]. First three elements 8,8,0; next 0,5,8.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is built by taking each row of the input, then appending some elements derived from the input's columns. For example, maybe the fourth element in the first row is the first element of the third column of the input. Let's see.\n\nIn example0's input, the columns are:\n\nCol0: [8,8,0]\nCol1: [5,5,3]\nCol2: [0,3,2]\n\nSo for row0 of output, after the original row [8,5,0], the next elements are 0 (from col2 row0?), 8 (col0 row0?), 8 (col0 row0 again). But col2 row0 is 0, col0 row0 is 8. So that fits. Then for the second row of output: [8,5,3,3,5,5]. Original row is [8,5,3], then 3 (col2 row1?), 5 (col1 row1?), 5 (col1 row1 again). But col2 row1 is 3, col1 row1 is5. Yes. For third row of output: [0,3,2,2,3,0]. Original row [0,3,2], then 2 (col2 row2?), 3 (col1 row2?), 0 (col0 row2?). Yes, col2 row2 is 2, col1 row2 is3, col0 row2 is0. So that's the pattern: after the original row, append the elements from the corresponding column. For row i, after the original elements, append the elements from column i in reverse order? Wait, let's check.\n\nWait, the first three rows of the output in example0:\n\nRow0: [8,5,0,0,8,8] \u2192 after [8,5,0], appends 0 (col2 row0?), 8 (col0 row0?), 8 (col0 row0 again? Or maybe from another part). Wait, col0 is [8,8,0]. So row0 of the input is [8,5,0]. The appended elements are col2 of row0 (0), col0 of row0 (8), and then col0 of row0 again (8). So that's 0,8,8.\n\nSimilarly, row1 of output is [8,5,3,3,5,5]. After original [8,5,3], appends col2 of row1 (3), col0 of row1 (8?), but here it's 5. Wait, maybe I'm mixing up rows and columns here. Let's clarify.\n\nWait, for each row in the input, after the three elements, the next three elements are taken from the columns of the input matrix. For example, in row0 of input, the original row is [8,5,0]. Then, the next three elements could be the elements from the same column index but in reverse order. So for column 0: [8,8,0]. Reverse is [0,8,8]. But the appended part in row0 is 0,8,8. So that's the reversed column0. Similarly, for row1: column1 is [5,5,3], reversed is [3,5,5], but the appended part is 3,5,5. For row2: column2 is [0,3,2], reversed is [2,3,0], which matches the appended part 2,3,0.\n\nAh! So the pattern here is: each original row is followed by the reversed elements of the corresponding column. So for input row i, the output row is original row + reversed column i. But how does that work with the length?\n\nWait, each input row is 3 elements. Each column in the input is 3 elements. When reversed, that's another 3 elements. So combining them gives 6 elements. So each output row is the original row followed by the reversed column of the same index.\n\nLet's check example0:\n\nRow0 of input is [8,5,0]. Column0 is [8,8,0], reversed is [0,8,8]. So output row0 is [8,5,0,0,8,8]. Correct.\n\nRow1 of input is [8,5,3]. Column1 is [5,5,3], reversed is [3,5,5]. So output row1 is [8,5,3,3,5,5]. Correct.\n\nRow2 of input is [0,3,2]. Column2 is [0,3,2], reversed is [2,3,0]. So output row2 is [0,3,2,2,3,0]. But in the example0 output, the third row is [0,3,2,2,3,0], and the fourth row is the same. Wait, but in the given output for example0, there are six rows. So perhaps after generating the first three rows by appending reversed columns, the next three rows are generated by appending something else. Wait, let's look at the entire output of example0:\n\nThe output is six rows:\n\nRow0: [8,5,0,0,8,8]\nRow1: [8,5,3,3,5,5]\nRow2: [0,3,2,2,3,0]\nRow3: [0,3,2,2,3,0]\nRow4: [5,5,3,3,5,8]\nRow5: [8,8,0,0,5,8]\n\nHmm. So rows 0-2 are the original rows with reversed columns. Then rows3-5 are something else. Let's see row3 is same as row2. Row4 is [5,5,3,3,5,8]. Maybe this is taking the reversed row of some column or row.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps after the first three rows, the next three rows are generated by taking the reversed columns again but in a different way. Wait, maybe the output is arranged as follows: the first three rows are original rows each followed by their respective reversed columns. Then the next three rows are the reversed rows of the first three rows, but with some modification.\n\nFor example, row3 of output in example0 is [0,3,2,2,3,0], which is the same as row2. Row4 is [5,5,3,3,5,8]. Let's see: maybe this is the reversed version of row1's appended part. Original row1's appended part was [3,5,5], reversed is [5,5,3], but then combined with the original row. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is constructed by taking the original 3x3 matrix and mirroring it both horizontally and vertically, creating a 6x6 matrix. For example, the original matrix is placed in the top-left quadrant, then the top-right is a horizontal mirror, the bottom-left is vertical mirror, and the bottom-right is a diagonal mirror. But how does that work?\n\nAnother approach: Let's see the output as a combination of the original matrix and its transpose, but that might not fit. Let me check the columns.\n\nIn example0, after the first three rows, rows3-5. Row3: [0,3,2,2,3,0]. That's the same as row2. Row4: [5,5,3,3,5,8]. Let's see, the first three elements are 5,5,3. Column1 of input is [5,5,3], reversed column1 is [3,5,5]. So if we take the reversed column1 and append something. But row4's first three elements are 5,5,3. Then 3,5,8. Hmm. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the entire output is formed by concatenating the original matrix with its rotations. For example, the first three rows are original plus reversed columns, the next three are the transpose or something.\n\nWait, in example1's output, the first three rows are:\n\n[3,8,2,8,3,3]\n[3,2,2,5,2,8]\n[8,5,2,2,2,2]\n\nThen the next three:\n\n[2,2,2,2,5,8]\n[8,2,5,2,2,3]\n[3,3,8,2,8,3]\n\nLooking at the first three rows, each original row is followed by reversed columns. Let's check input for example1:\n\nInput:\n\n[3,8,2]\n[3,2,2]\n[8,5,2]\n\nColumns would be:\n\ncol0: [3,3,8]\ncol1: [8,2,5]\ncol2: [2,2,2]\n\nFor row0 of input [3,8,2], reversed column0 is reversed([3,3,8]) \u2192 [8,3,3]. So the appended part would be 8,3,3. Which matches row0's output: [3,8,2,8,3,3]. Correct.\n\nRow1: [3,2,2]. Reversed column1 is reversed([8,2,5]) \u2192 [5,2,8]. Appended part is 5,2,8. So output row1 should be [3,2,2,5,2,8], which matches.\n\nRow2: [8,5,2]. Reversed column2 is reversed([2,2,2]) \u2192 [2,2,2]. Appended part is 2,2,2. So output row2 is [8,5,2,2,2,2]. Correct.\n\nThen the next three rows in example1's output:\n\nRow3: [2,2,2,2,5,8] \u2192 this seems to be the reversed row2 of the first part. Original row2's first part is [8,5,2], reversed is [2,5,8], then appended with reversed column3? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the next three rows might be the reversed original rows with their respective reversed columns. Let's see:\n\nOriginal row0 reversed is [2,8,3]. Then append reversed column0? Reversed column0 is [8,3,3], but how? Let's take the reversed row0 [2,8,3], then append reversed column for the same index. So column index 0's reversed is [8,3,3]. But the row3 in example1 is [2,2,2,2,5,8], which doesn't match.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the next three rows are the original columns reversed and then processed similarly. For example, the fourth row could be the reversed column0, then append its reversed column. Let's see:\n\nReversed column0 for example1 is [8,3,3]. Then the appended part would be reversed column0 again (since the index is 0?), which is [3,3,8]. So the row would be [8,3,3,3,3,8]. But in example1's row4, the fourth row is [8,2,5,2,2,3]. Doesn't match.\n\nHmm, this approach isn't working. Let's think differently. The output has six rows, each with six elements. Maybe the first three rows are original rows followed by reversed columns, and the next three rows are the reversed original rows followed by their corresponding reversed columns.\n\nLet's check example0. Original rows are:\n\nRow0: [8,5,0]\nRow1: [8,5,3]\nRow2: [0,3,2]\n\nReversed rows would be:\n\nRow0 reversed: [0,5,8]\nRow1 reversed: [3,5,8]\nRow2 reversed: [2,3,0]\n\nThen, for each reversed row, append the reversed column of their index. So, for reversed row0 [0,5,8], which corresponds to original row0's reverse. The column index would be 0, so reversed column0 is [0,8,8] (from example0). Wait, the reversed column0 is [0,8,8], which is the same as before.\n\nWait, no. Let's take example0's reversed row0: [0,5,8]. Then, for the next three elements, we need to take the reversed column0. Column0 of the original input is [8,8,0], reversed is [0,8,8]. So appending to reversed row0 [0,5,8] gives [0,5,8,0,8,8]. But looking at example0's output, the fourth row is [0,3,2,2,3,0], which is the same as row2. So that doesn't fit.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Let's try to find another pattern. Let's look at the entire output for example0. The output grid is:\n\nRow0: 8 5 0 0 8 8\nRow1:8 5 3 3 5 5\nRow2:0 3 2 2 3 0\nRow3:0 3 2 2 3 0\nRow4:5 5 3 3 5 8\nRow5:8 8 0 0 5 8\n\nObserving this, the first three rows are as discussed. The fourth row is the same as the third row. The fifth row starts with 5,5,3. Column1 of the original input is [5,5,3]. So reversed column1 is [3,5,5]. So if the fifth row starts with [5,5,3], then appending reversed column1 would give [5,5,3,3,5,5], but the actual fifth row is [5,5,3,3,5,8]. The last element is 8, which is from column0's reversed [0,8,8]. Not sure.\n\nAnother angle: Maybe the entire output is constructed by arranging the original matrix and its transformations in a specific way. For example, the first three rows are the original rows with reversed columns appended, and the next three rows are the reversed rows of the original matrix with their reversed columns appended.\n\nWait, let's take the original matrix:\n\nOriginal rows:\n\nRow0: [8,5,0]\nRow1: [8,5,3]\nRow2: [0,3,2]\n\nReversed rows (row reversed, not element-wise):\n\nOriginal rows in reverse order would be row2, row1, row0. But how does that fit into the output?\n\nAlternatively, each row is reversed in the next three rows. For example, the fourth row in example0's output is [0,3,2,2,3,0], which is the same as row2's output. So maybe the next three rows are the original rows but in reverse order, each followed by their respective reversed columns.\n\nIn example0, rows3-5:\n\nRow3: [0,3,2,2,3,0] \u2192 same as row2.\nRow4: [5,5,3,3,5,8]\nRow5: [8,8,0,0,5,8]\n\nRow4's first three elements are [5,5,3], which is column1 of the original input. Reversed column1 is [3,5,5], so appending reversed column1 would make [5,5,3,3,5,5], but the actual row4 is [5,5,3,3,5,8]. So the last element is 8 instead of 5. Hmm. That doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the next three rows are the reversed columns of the original matrix. For example:\n\nIn example0, columns are:\n\ncol0: [8,8,0]\ncol1: [5,5,3]\ncol2: [0,3,2]\n\nReversed columns:\n\ncol0 reversed: [0,8,8]\ncol1 reversed: [3,5,5]\ncol2 reversed: [2,3,0]\n\nSo rows3-5 could be the reversed columns, each followed by their reversed columns again. For example, row3 would be col0 reversed ([0,8,8]) followed by col0 reversed again \u2192 [0,8,8,0,8,8]. But in example0's output, row3 is [0,3,2,2,3,0], which is the same as row2. So that doesn't fit.\n\nThis is getting really tricky. Let me think about the Test Input to see if applying a certain pattern works.\n\nTest Input:\n\n[2,5,0]\n[2,5,1]\n[3,1,1]\n\nSo the input is a 3x3 matrix. Let's first compute the columns:\n\ncol0: [2,2,3]\ncol1: [5,5,1]\ncol2: [0,1,1]\n\nIf the pattern is that each row in the output is the original row followed by the reversed column of the same index, then the first three rows of the test output would be:\n\nRow0: [2,5,0] followed by reversed col0 \u2192 reversed col0 is [3,2,2]. So row0 would be [2,5,0,3,2,2].\n\nRow1: [2,5,1] followed by reversed col1 \u2192 col1 is [5,5,1], reversed is [1,5,5]. So row1 is [2,5,1,1,5,5].\n\nRow2: [3,1,1] followed by reversed col2 \u2192 col2 is [0,1,1], reversed is [1,1,0]. So row2 is [3,1,1,1,1,0].\n\nBut looking at the training examples, the first three rows of the output are generated exactly this way. So then what about the next three rows? Let's see.\n\nIn example0, the next three rows are:\n\nRow3: same as row2 of the first three.\nRow4: [5,5,3,3,5,8] \u2192 which is col1 reversed followed by col0 reversed? Or something else.\nRow5: [8,8,0,0,5,8] \u2192 col0 reversed followed by col0 reversed again?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the next three rows are the reversed columns followed by their respective reversed columns. So for example, row3 would be col0 reversed [0,8,8] followed by col0 reversed again [0,8,8] \u2192 [0,8,8,0,8,8], but in example0, row3 is [0,3,2,2,3,0], which doesn't match.\n\nAlternatively, the next three rows are the reversed rows of the original matrix, each followed by their respective reversed columns. Let's try that.\n\nOriginal rows reversed (reverse the order of the rows):\n\nrow2: [0,3,2]\nrow1: [8,5,3]\nrow0: [8,5,0]\n\nThen, for each of these reversed rows, append the reversed column of their index. So:\n\nRow3 (reversed row0's first row, which is row2: [0,3,2]) \u2192 append reversed col2: [2,3,0]. So row3 would be [0,3,2,2,3,0], which matches example0's output row3.\n\nRow4: reversed row1 (original row1 is [8,5,3], reversed rows order would be row1 becomes row1 in reversed order, but this is getting confusing. Wait, if the next three rows are the original rows in reverse order (row2, row1, row0), then each of those rows is followed by their respective reversed columns.\n\nRow3: row2 \u2192 [0,3,2], append reversed col2 \u2192 [2,3,0]. So row3 is [0,3,2,2,3,0]. Which matches example0's row3.\n\nRow4: row1 \u2192 [8,5,3], append reversed col1 \u2192 reversed col1 is [3,5,5]. So row4 would be [8,5,3,3,5,5]. But example0's row4 is [5,5,3,3,5,8]. Doesn't match.\n\nHmm. So that doesn't fit. But in example0, row4 is [5,5,3,3,5,8]. The first three elements are [5,5,3], which is reversed col1 [3,5,5] reversed again \u2192 [5,5,3]. Then append reversed col1 again [3,5,5] \u2192 but row4 is [5,5,3,3,5,8]. The last three elements are [3,5,8]. Wait, 8 is from col0's reversed. This is confusing.\n\nAnother thought: maybe the entire output is constructed as follows:\n\n- The first three rows are each original row followed by the reversed column of the same index.\n- The next three rows are each reversed original row (element-wise reversed) followed by the reversed column of the original row's index.\n\nLet's test this on example0.\n\nOriginal row0: [8,5,0]. Reversed row0: [0,5,8]. Reversed column0 is [0,8,8]. So the row would be [0,5,8,0,8,8]. But example0's row3 is [0,3,2,2,3,0], which is row2's original row plus reversed column2. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, the next three rows could be the reversed original rows (element-wise), followed by their respective reversed columns.\n\nOriginal row0 reversed: [0,5,8]. Append reversed column0: [0,8,8]. So row3 would be [0,5,8,0,8,8]. Not matching example0's row3.\n\nThis is really challenging. Let me try to find another pattern by looking at the elements.\n\nIn example0's output:\n\nRow0: 8 5 0 0 8 8 \u2192 the last three elements are 0,8,8. These are the third element of row0 (0), first element of row0 (8), and first element again (8).\n\nRow1:8 5 3 3 5 5 \u2192 last three are 3 (third element of row1), 5 (second element of row1), 5 (second again).\n\nRow2:0 3 2 2 3 0 \u2192 last three are 2 (third), 3 (second), 0 (first).\n\nRow3: same as row2.\n\nRow4:5 5 3 3 5 8 \u2192 first three elements are 5,5,3 (column1 of input), then 3,5,8.\n\nRow5:8 8 0 0 5 8 \u2192 first three elements are 8,8,0 (column0 of input), then 0,5,8.\n\nSo perhaps rows 3-5 are built by taking the columns of the input and appending their reversed columns. For example:\n\nRow3: column2 of input is [0,3,2], reversed column2 is [2,3,0]. So row3 is [0,3,2,2,3,0], which matches.\n\nRow4: column1 of input is [5,5,3]. Reversed column1 is [3,5,5]. So row4 would be [5,5,3,3,5,5], but the actual row4 is [5,5,3,3,5,8]. The last element is 8. Hmm. Where does 8 come from? It's the first element of column0 of input (8). So maybe it's a combination of column1 and column0.\n\nRow5: column0 of input is [8,8,0]. Reversed column0 is [0,8,8]. So row5 would be [8,8,0,0,8,8], but the actual row5 is [8,8,0,0,5,8]. The fifth element is 5, which is from column1's first element (5). So maybe this isn't the case.\n\nAlternatively, rows3-5 are columns of the input followed by reversed columns of other indices. But this seems too vague.\n\nAnother observation: in example0's output, row4 is [5,5,3,3,5,8]. The first three elements are 5,5,3 which is column1 of input. The next three elements are 3,5,8. Which is column1 reversed (3,5,5) but the last element is 8 instead of 5. 8 is the first element of column0. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the next three rows are the reversed columns of the input, each followed by their own reversed columns.\n\nFor example, reversed column0 is [0,8,8]. So row3 would be [0,8,8] followed by reversed column0 again [0,8,8], making [0,8,8,0,8,8]. But example0's row3 is [0,3,2,2,3,0], which is the same as row2's output. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAt this point, I might need to consider that the pattern involves both rows and columns in a more complex way, possibly involving rotations or transpositions.\n\nAnother idea: The output is the original matrix concatenated with its vertical mirror, then horizontal mirror. For a 3x3 matrix, vertical mirror would append the reversed rows, and horizontal mirror would append the reversed columns. But this is for expanding to a 6x3 or 3x6 matrix, not 6x6.\n\nAlternatively, the output could be a 6x6 matrix formed by placing the original matrix in four quadrants. For example:\n\nTop-left: original matrix.\nTop-right: original matrix's horizontal flip.\nBottom-left: original matrix's vertical flip.\nBottom-right: original matrix's rotated 180 degrees.\n\nBut this would generate a 6x6 grid. Let's see example0's input.\n\nOriginal matrix:\n\n8 5 0\n8 5 3\n0 3 2\n\nHorizontal flip (reverse each row):\n\n0 5 8\n3 5 8\n2 3 0\n\nVertical flip (reverse the order of the rows):\n\n0 3 2\n8 5 3\n8 5 0\n\nRotated 180 degrees (reverse rows and elements):\n\n2 3 0\n3 5 8\n0 5 8\n\nNow, arrange these into quadrants:\n\nTop-left: original\nTop-right: horizontal flip\nBottom-left: vertical flip\nBottom-right: 180 rotated.\n\nBut combining these into a 6x6 matrix:\n\nFirst three rows would be original followed by horizontal flip.\n\nRows 0-2:\n\n8 5 0 | 0 5 8\n8 5 3 | 3 5 8\n0 3 2 | 2 3 0\n\nThen rows 3-5:\n\n0 3 2 | 2 3 0\n8 5 3 | 3 5 8\n8 5 0 | 0 5 8\n\nBut this doesn't match the example0 output. For instance, the first row of example0's output is [8,5,0,0,8,8], but according to this pattern, it would be [8,5,0,0,5,8]. The fourth element is 0, but in the output it's 0 followed by 8,8. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAnother approach: Maybe the output is a combination of the original matrix and its transpose. But again, the transpose of a 3x3 is another 3x3, so combining them would make 3x6 or 6x3, not 6x6.\n\nWait, perhaps each row of the output is constructed by taking the original row and then appending a modified version based on some diagonal elements.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the pattern involves taking each element and applying some mathematical operation. For example, sum with adjacent elements or something. But the numbers in the output don't immediately suggest this.\n\nLooking back at the training examples, perhaps the key is to realize that each row in the output is generated by a specific rule that involves the original row and its corresponding column, and then the process is repeated for the next set of rows using transformed versions.\n\nAfter spending a lot of time and not finding a clear pattern, I think the most promising lead is the first three rows being the original row followed by the reversed column of the same index, as that fits all the first three rows of the training examples. For the next three rows, maybe they are the reversed columns of the original matrix, each followed by their reversed columns again. Let's test this hypothesis.\n\nFor example0's columns:\n\ncol0: [8,8,0] \u2192 reversed is [0,8,8]\ncol1: [5,5,3] \u2192 reversed is [3,5,5]\ncol2: [0,3,2] \u2192 reversed is [2,3,0]\n\nSo rows3-5 would be:\n\nRow3: [0,8,8,0,8,8] (col0 reversed + col0 reversed)\nRow4: [3,5,5,3,5,5] (col1 reversed + col1 reversed)\nRow5: [2,3,0,2,3,0] (col2 reversed + col2 reversed)\n\nBut example0's actual rows3-5 are:\n\nRow3: [0,3,2,2,3,0]\nRow4: [5,5,3,3,5,8]\nRow5: [8,8,0,0,5,8]\n\nWhich doesn't match. So that's not the case.\n\nHmm. Let's think differently. The output for each training example has six rows, which is double the original three. Maybe each original row is duplicated with some transformation. Looking at example0's output:\n\nRow0: [8,5,0,0,8,8]\nRow1: [8,5,3,3,5,5]\nRow2: [0,3,2,2,3,0]\nRow3: [0,3,2,2,3,0]\nRow4: [5,5,3,3,5,8]\nRow5: [8,8,0,0,5,8]\n\nNotice that rows 0-2 are the original rows with appended elements, and rows3-5 seem to be transformations. For example, row3 is the same as row2. Row4 starts with [5,5,3], which is column1 of the input. Row5 starts with [8,8,0], which is column0 of the input.\n\nSo perhaps the first three rows are original rows followed by reversed columns, and the next three rows are the columns of the original matrix followed by reversed columns of their own indices.\n\nFor example, row3 would be column2 of the input followed by reversed column2. Column2 is [0,3,2], reversed column2 is [2,3,0]. So row3 would be [0,3,2,2,3,0], which matches example0's row3.\n\nRow4 would be column1 of the input [5,5,3], followed by reversed column1 [3,5,5]. So row4 would be [5,5,3,3,5,5]. But example0's row4 is [5,5,3,3,5,8]. The last element is 8 instead of 5. Where does 8 come from? It's the first element of column0. So maybe there's an error in this pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the next three rows are the columns of the input followed by the reversed columns of the original matrix. For example, row3 is column2 followed by reversed column0. Column2 is [0,3,2], reversed column0 is [0,8,8]. So row3 would be [0,3,2,0,8,8], but example0's row3 is [0,3,2,2,3,0]. Doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, row3 is column2 followed by reversed column2. Which gives [0,3,2,2,3,0]. Which matches example0's row3. Then row4 would be column1 followed by reversed column1: [5,5,3,3,5,5]. But example0's row4 is [5,5,3,3,5,8]. So the last element is 8 instead of 5. So this doesn't fit.\n\nThis is really frustrating. Let's try to find another approach. Let's look at the test input and see if applying the initial pattern (first three rows are original row + reversed column) would generate the required output.\n\nTest Input:\n\n[2,5,0]\n[2,5,1]\n[3,1,1]\n\nColumns:\n\ncol0: [2,2,3]\ncol1: [5,5,1]\ncol2: [0,1,1]\n\nReversed columns:\n\ncol0 reversed: [3,2,2]\ncol1 reversed: [1,5,5]\ncol2 reversed: [1,1,0]\n\nSo the first three rows of the output would be:\n\nRow0: [2,5,0] + reversed col0 \u2192 [3,2,2] \u2192 so row0: [2,5,0,3,2,2]\n\nRow1: [2,5,1] + reversed col1 \u2192 [1,5,5] \u2192 row1: [2,5,1,1,5,5]\n\nRow2: [3,1,1] + reversed col2 \u2192 [1,1,0] \u2192 row2: [3,1,1,1,1,0]\n\nNow, the next three rows would need to follow whatever pattern the training examples have. For example0's next three rows are:\n\nRow3: same as row2 of the first three.\n\nRow4: [5,5,3,3,5,8] \u2192 which is col1 reversed ([3,5,5]) followed by something. Maybe col0 reversed ([0,8,8]) but not sure.\n\nAlternatively, row4 is col1 of the input ([5,5,3]) followed by reversed col1 ([3,5,5]). But in the test case, col1 is [5,5,1], reversed is [1,5,5]. So row4 would be [5,5,1,1,5,5]. But how does that fit into the existing pattern?\n\nBut looking at example0's row4: [5,5,3,3,5,8]. The first three elements are col1 of the input, then the next three are reversed col1 (3,5,5) but modified. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, the next three rows are the reversed columns of the input followed by their reversed columns. For example, row3 is reversed col2: [2,3,0] (from example0's reversed col2) followed by reversed col2 again. But this doesn't fit.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and not finding a clear pattern for the next three rows, perhaps the pattern is that the first three rows are original row followed by reversed column, and the next three rows are the reversed columns of the original matrix followed by their reversed columns. For example:\n\nRow3: reversed col0 \u2192 [3,2,2] (for test input's col0 reversed) followed by reversed col0 again \u2192 [3,2,2,3,2,2]. But this doesn't fit the training examples.\n\nAlternatively, the next three rows are the reversed columns of the original matrix, each followed by reversed column of the same index. For example:\n\nRow3: reversed col0 \u2192 [3,2,2], then append reversed col0 again \u2192 [3,2,2,3,2,2].\n\nRow4: reversed col1 \u2192 [1,5,5], append reversed col1 \u2192 [1,5,5,1,5,5].\n\nRow5: reversed col2 \u2192 [1,1,0], append reversed col2 \u2192 [1,1,0,1,1,0].\n\nBut in example0's output, row3 is [0,3,2,2,3,0], which would be reversed col2 [2,3,0] followed by reversed col2 again. But in example0's case, col2 reversed is [2,3,0], so row3 would be [2,3,0,2,3,0], but the actual row3 is [0,3,2,2,3,0]. So not matching.\n\nThis is really perplexing. Given that I'm stuck, perhaps I should proceed with the pattern I've identified for the first three rows and make an educated guess for the next three based on the training examples.\n\nIn example0's output, the next three rows are:\n\nRow3: same as row2 of the first three.\n\nRow4: [5,5,3,3,5,8] \u2192 first three elements are col1 of input, then [3,5,8]. The last three elements seem to be col1 reversed (3,5,5) but last element is 8 (col0's first element).\n\nRow5: [8,8,0,0,5,8] \u2192 first three are col0 of input, then [0,5,8]. The last three elements are col0 reversed (0,8,8) but middle element is 5 (col1's first element).\n\nThis seems inconsistent, but maybe there's a pattern where the next three rows are the columns of the input followed by a combination of elements from other columns.\n\nAlternatively, the next three rows are formed by taking each column of the input, then appending the corresponding column from the first three rows' appended parts.\n\nFor example, row3 is col2 of the input followed by col2's appended part. In example0, row2's appended part is [2,3,0], which is reversed col2. So row3 is col2 followed by reversed col2 \u2192 [0,3,2,2,3,0], which matches. So in general, the next three rows are the columns of the input followed by their respective reversed columns.\n\nSo for the test input:\n\nRow3: col2 of input is [0,1,1], followed by reversed col2 [1,1,0] \u2192 [0,1,1,1,1,0].\n\nRow4: col1 of input is [5,5,1], followed by reversed col1 [1,5,5] \u2192 [5,5,1,1,5,5].\n\nRow5: col0 of input is [2,2,3], followed by reversed col0 [3,2,2] \u2192 [2,2,3,3,2,2].\n\nBut looking at example0's output, row3 is [0,3,2,2,3,0] (col2 followed by reversed col2). Row4: [5,5,3,3,5,8] which is col1 followed by [3,5,8], which doesn't match reversed col1. So this doesn't hold. \n\nBut in example0's row4, it's [5,5,3,3,5,8]. The first three elements are col1 of the input. The next three are [3,5,8]. Where do these come from? 3 is from reversed col1's first element (3), 5 from reversed col1's second (5), but 8 is from col0's first element. This seems arbitrary.\n\nGiven the time I've invested and the competition setting, perhaps I should proceed with the first part of the pattern (original row + reversed column) for the first three rows, and for the next three rows, replicate the first three rows in reverse order, or some other transformation. Alternatively, perhaps the output is simply the first three rows followed by their mirror images.\n\nBut looking at example0's output, the fourth row is the same as the third row, the fifth row is a new combination, and the sixth row is another new combination. This suggests that the pattern isn't simply appending reversed columns for all six rows.\n\nGiven the time constraints, I'll proceed with the first part of the pattern for the first three rows and assume that the next three rows are the reversed columns of the original matrix followed by their respective reversed columns. This is a guess, but it's the best I can do given the time.\n\nFor the test input:\n\nFirst three rows:\n\nRow0: [2,5,0,3,2,2] (original row0 + reversed col0 [3,2,2])\nRow1: [2,5,1,1,5,5] (original row1 + reversed col1 [1,5,5])\nRow2: [3,1,1,1,1,0] (original row2 + reversed col2 [1,1,0])\n\nNext three rows:\n\nRow3: reversed col0 [3,2,2] followed by reversed col0 again \u2192 [3,2,2,3,2,2]\nRow4: reversed col1 [1,5,5] followed by reversed col1 again \u2192 [1,5,5,1,5,5]\nRow5: reversed col2 [1,1,0] followed by reversed col2 again \u2192 [1,1,0,1,1,0]\n\nBut this doesn't match the training examples. For example, in example0's row4, the fifth row is [8,8,0,0,5,8], which doesn't follow this pattern. \n\nGiven that this approach doesn't align with the training examples, perhaps there's a different pattern. \n\nAlternative approach: Let's look at the positions of the elements in the output rows. For example0's row0:\n\n[8,5,0,0,8,8]\n\nPositions 0-2 are the original row0. Positions 3-5 are 0,8,8. Which correspond to the elements of column0 in reverse order. Column0 is [8,8,0], reversed is [0,8,8].\n\nSimilarly, row1's appended elements are column1 reversed. Column1 is [5,5,3], reversed is [3,5,5]. Which matches.\n\nRow2's appended elements are column2 reversed: [0,3,2] reversed \u2192 [2,3,0], but appended elements are [2,3,0]. So yes.\n\nThen, rows3-5: in example0, row3 is [0,3,2,2,3,0], which is the original row2 appended with column2 reversed. But row3 is the same as row2. This suggests that perhaps rows3-5 are the same as rows0-2 but in reverse order. For example0, rows3-5 are row2, row1, row0 of the first three rows. But that's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps rows3-5 are the columns of the input matrix treated as rows, each followed by their reversed columns.\n\nFor example0:\n\nColumns as rows:\n\ncol0: [8,8,0] \u2192 followed by reversed col0 \u2192 [0,8,8]. So row3 would be [8,8,0,0,8,8], but example0's row3 is [0,3,2,2,3,0]. Doesn't fit.\n\nThis is really perplexing. Given the time I've spent and the need to provide an answer, I'll proceed with the first three rows as per the initial pattern and assume that the next three rows are the same as the first three but in reverse order or some other transformation. However, this doesn't align with the training examples perfectly, but it's a starting point.\n\nFor the test input, applying the initial pattern:\n\nFirst three rows:\n\n[2,5,0,3,2,2]\n[2,5,1,1,5,5]\n[3,1,1,1,1,0]\n\nThen, for the next three rows, perhaps they are the reversed rows of the first three rows. So:\n\nRow3: [3,1,1,1,1,0] \u2192 same as row2\nRow4: [2,5,1,1,5,5] \u2192 same as row1\nRow5: [2,5,0,3,2,2] \u2192 same as row0\n\nBut looking at example0's output, row3 is the same as row2, and row4 and row5 are new. So perhaps the next three rows are row2, row1, row0 of the first three rows. \n\nIn the test case, this would be:\n\nRow3: [3,1,1,1,1,0]\nRow4: [2,5,1,1,5,5]\nRow5: [2,5,0,3,2,2]\n\nBut example0's row4 and row5 don't follow this pattern, so this is likely incorrect.\n\nAnother possibility is that the next three rows are generated by rotating the first three rows. For example, each row is rotated right by one position. But I'm not sure.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and not finding a clear pattern, I'll proceed to write the answer based on the first part of the pattern (original row + reversed column) for the first three rows, and for the next three rows, perhaps they are the columns of the input followed by their reversed columns. Even though this doesn't perfectly fit the training examples, it's the best I can do.\n\nTest input's columns:\n\ncol0: [2,2,3] \u2192 reversed is [3,2,2]\ncol1: [5,5,1] \u2192 reversed is [1,5,5]\ncol2: [0,1,1] \u2192 reversed is [1,1,0]\n\nSo the next three rows would be:\n\nRow3: col0 \u2192 [2,2,3] followed by reversed col0 \u2192 [3,2,2] \u2192 [2,2,3,3,2,2]\n\nRow4: col1 \u2192 [5,5,1] followed by reversed col1 \u2192 [1,5,5] \u2192 [5,5,1,1,5,5]\n\nRow5: col2 \u2192 [0,1,1] followed by reversed col2 \u2192 [1,1,0] \u2192 [0,1,1,1,1,0]\n\nBut looking at example0's output, the fourth row is [5,5,3,3,5,8], which would correspond to col1 followed by reversed col1 (3,5,5), but the appended part is [3,5,8], which is not reversed col1. So this doesn't fit.\n\nGiven that I'm stuck, I'll proceed to provide the answer based on the first three rows following the initial pattern and the next three rows being the same as the first three in reverse order. Although this may not be correct, it's the best I can manage under time constraints.",

        "cot_2": "Okay, let's see. I need to figure out the pattern from the training examples and apply it to the test input. Let's start by looking at the examples.\n\nIn Example 0, the input is three rows:\n[8,5,0]\n[8,5,3]\n[0,3,2]\n\nThe output has six rows. So the input is 3x3, and the output is 6x6. That suggests that each input row is somehow expanded into two output rows, or maybe the input is transformed into a larger matrix. Let me check the output for Example 0.\n\nLooking at the first input row [8,5,0], the first output row is [8,5,0,0,8,8]. The second output row is [8,5,3,3,5,5]. Wait, the second input row is [8,5,3], so the output's first two rows might be combining elements from the first and second input rows. Hmm. Let me see how the elements are arranged.\n\nLooking at the first output row of Example 0: 8,5,0 followed by 0,8,8. The first three elements are the same as the input's first row. The next three elements start with 0, which is the third element of the first row, then 8 and 8. Wait, maybe there's a mirroring involved. Let's check the third element of the first input row (0), then maybe mirroring the first row? Like 0, then 8 (first element) and 8 again? Or maybe the next elements are reverse or some combination.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is constructed by taking each row of the input and creating two rows in the output by appending certain elements. Let me look at the first input row's output:\n\nInput row 0: [8,5,0] \u2192 Output rows 0 and 3 (assuming each input row becomes two output rows). Wait, the output has six rows. Let me see:\n\nIn Example 0's output:\nRow 0: [8,5,0,0,8,8]\nRow 1: [8,5,3,3,5,5]\nRow 2: [0,3,2,2,3,0]\nRow 3: [0,3,2,2,3,0]\nRow 4: [5,5,3,3,5,8]\nRow 5: [8,8,0,0,5,8]\n\nHmm, the input has three rows. The output has six rows. So perhaps each input row is duplicated or transformed in a way that creates two rows each. But looking at the first two output rows, row 0 is from input row 0, row 1 from input row 1, row 2 from input row 2, then row 3 is same as row 2. Then rows 4 and 5 might be transformations of the input in reverse order or something.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is a combination of the original matrix and its transformations. Let's check the structure.\n\nAnother approach: Look at how each output row is formed. Let's take the first output row of Example 0: [8,5,0,0,8,8]. The first three elements are the original first input row. The next three elements start with 0 (the third element of the first row), then 8 (the first element of the first row), then another 8. So maybe it's appending [third element, first element, first element].\n\nWait, let's check:\n\nFirst input row [8,5,0] \u2192 first output row's last three elements are 0,8,8. So 0 is the third element, then 8 (first element), 8 again. So maybe the pattern for the first part is take the original row, then append [third element, first element, first element].\n\nSimilarly, the second output row is from the second input row [8,5,3]. The last three elements are 3,5,5. Third element is 3, first element is 8? Wait no. Wait the input row is [8,5,3], so the last three elements of the output row are 3 (third element), then 5 (second element?), 5. Wait that doesn't fit. Wait the output row is [8,5,3,3,5,5]. So after the original elements, it's 3 (third element), 5 (second), 5 again. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the appended part is the reverse of the original row, but with some modification. Let's see:\n\nOriginal row [8,5,0] \u2192 append [0,8,8]. The reverse of [8,5,0] is [0,5,8], but that's not the case here. Wait 0,8,8. Maybe first element is the third element of the original, then first element repeated twice.\n\nYes! For the first output row: original is [8,5,0]. Appended elements are [0,8,8]. So third element (0), then first element (8) twice.\n\nSecond output row's original is [8,5,3]. Appended elements are [3,5,5]. Third element (3), then second element (5) twice. Wait, 5 is the second element here. Wait, that doesn't match the first case. Hmm.\n\nWait first case: third element, first element, first element.\n\nSecond case: third element (3), then second element (5) twice. So inconsistency here. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the appended part is the third element followed by the sum of first and second elements. But in first case, third is 0, sum 8+5=13, which doesn't match. So that's not.\n\nLooking at the third input row in Example 0: [0,3,2]. The third output row is [0,3,2,2,3,0]. Then the appended part is [2,3,0]. Which is the reverse of the original row. So original [0,3,2] becomes [0,3,2] followed by reverse [2,3,0]. Wait, but the output row 2 is [0,3,2,2,3,0], which is original plus reverse. Then row 3 is same as row 2. Then row 4 is [5,5,3,3,5,8], which might be from the second input row [8,5,3] transformed. Let's see: if we take the second input row [8,5,3], and reverse it to [3,5,8], then maybe append something. But row 4 is [5,5,3,3,5,8]. Not sure.\n\nThis is a bit tricky. Let me look at another example. Example 1's input:\n\n[3,8,2]\n[3,2,2]\n[8,5,2]\n\nOutput:\n\n[3,8,2,8,3,3]\n[3,2,2,5,2,8]\n[8,5,2,2,2,2]\n[2,2,2,2,5,8]\n[8,2,5,2,2,3]\n[3,3,8,2,8,3]\n\nLooking at the first output row [3,8,2,8,3,3]. Original input row is [3,8,2]. The appended part is 8,3,3. Wait, the third element is 2, but the appended starts with 8. Hmm. So maybe not the same as previous idea.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the appended elements are the next row's elements. For example, the first row's appended part could be from the second input row. Let's see:\n\nIn Example 0, first input row is [8,5,0]. The output first row's appended part is [0,8,8]. The second input row is [8,5,3]. The output second row's appended part is [3,5,5]. Third input row is [0,3,2], and the third output row's appended part is [2,3,0]. Then the fourth output row is same as third. The fifth row is [5,5,3,3,5,8], and the sixth is [8,8,0,0,5,8]. Maybe the fifth row is derived from the second input row [8,5,3] but transformed. Like reversed or rotated.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the original matrix stacked with some transformations. For example, the first three rows could be the original rows each with some appended elements, and the next three rows are transformations of the original matrix, perhaps mirrored or rotated.\n\nLooking at Example 0's output rows 0-2:\n\nRow 0: [8,5,0,0,8,8]\n\nRow 1: [8,5,3,3,5,5]\n\nRow 2: [0,3,2,2,3,0]\n\nThen rows 3-5:\n\nRow3: same as row2.\n\nRow4: [5,5,3,3,5,8]\n\nRow5: [8,8,0,0,5,8]\n\nWait, row4's first three elements are [5,5,3], which could be from the second input row [8,5,3] but modified. Maybe row4 is a transformed version of input row 1.\n\nAlternatively, the output is constructed by taking the original 3x3 matrix and creating a 6x6 matrix by reflecting or rotating it. Let's think in terms of a matrix transformation.\n\nOriginal matrix (3x3):\n\nA B C\n\nD E F\n\nG H I\n\nThen, the output is a 6x6 matrix. Let's see if it's a combination of the original and some reflections.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each row in the input is expanded into two rows in the output. For example, input row 0 becomes output row 0 and row 3. But in Example 0, output row3 is same as row2. So that might not be the case.\n\nAnother approach: Let's look at the columns. For Example 0's output:\n\nRow0: 8,5,0,0,8,8\n\nRow1:8,5,3,3,5,5\n\nRow2:0,3,2,2,3,0\n\nRow3:0,3,2,2,3,0\n\nRow4:5,5,3,3,5,8\n\nRow5:8,8,0,0,5,8\n\nLooking at the columns, perhaps there's a mirroring. For example, columns 0-2 are the original 3x3, and columns 3-5 are some mirrored version.\n\nBut in row0, columns 3-5 are 0,8,8. Which might be the reverse of the first row plus some elements. Alternatively, maybe columns 3-5 are constructed based on the original rows in a certain pattern.\n\nWait, looking at the first three elements of each output row in Example0:\n\nRows0: [8,5,0] \u2192 input row0.\n\nRows1: [8,5,3] \u2192 input row1.\n\nRows2: [0,3,2] \u2192 input row2.\n\nRows3: same as row2.\n\nRows4: [5,5,3] \u2192 not an input row.\n\nRows5: [8,8,0] \u2192 not an input row.\n\nSo maybe after the first three rows (which are input rows with appended data), the next three rows are some transformed versions. Let's look at row4 and row5.\n\nRow4: [5,5,3,3,5,8]. The first three elements are 5,5,3. Where could this come from? The input's second row is [8,5,3]. Maybe reversed? Reversed would be [3,5,8], but that's not the case. Alternatively, maybe taking elements from different rows. For example, 5 is the middle element of input row1 (8,5,3). Then maybe 5,5,3. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each output row after the third is a reversed or transformed version of the first three rows. For example, row4 is [5,5,3,3,5,8]. The last three elements are 3,5,8. Which is the reversed input row1: [8,5,3] reversed is [3,5,8]. So the first three elements could be [5,5,3] which is the middle element of input row1 (5) repeated, then 3. Not sure.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Maybe there's a different approach. Let's see the test input and see if applying possible patterns gives a clue.\n\nTest input:\n\n[2,5,0]\n\n[2,5,1]\n\n[3,1,1]\n\nExpected output should be six rows. Let's try to find a pattern from the examples.\n\nLooking at Example0's output, the first three output rows are:\n\n[8,5,0,0,8,8] \u2192 input row0 followed by [0,8,8]\n\n[8,5,3,3,5,5] \u2192 input row1 followed by [3,5,5]\n\n[0,3,2,2,3,0] \u2192 input row2 followed by [2,3,0]\n\nThen rows3-5 are:\n\nRow3: same as row2's output.\n\nRow4: [5,5,3,3,5,8] \u2192 perhaps based on row1, but first three elements 5,5,3 (maybe row1's elements rearranged: 5,5,3 (from 8,5,3?), then appending 3,5,8 (reverse of row1? 3,5,8 is reverse of [8,5,3] \u2192 yes.)\n\nRow5: [8,8,0,0,5,8] \u2192 first three elements 8,8,0 (maybe from row0: 8,5,0, but first element repeated, then 0. Then appending 0,5,8 (which is row0's elements in reverse? [0,5,8] reversed is [8,5,0], but appended part is 0,5,8. Wait row0's original is [8,5,0], reversed is [0,5,8]. So appending reversed row0: [0,5,8]. But in row5's appended part it's 0,5,8. So row5 is [8,8,0,0,5,8]. The first three elements are 8,8,0: which is row0's first element twice, then third element. Then appended reversed row0: 0,5,8. Wait, but in the output row5, it's 0,5,8 as the last three elements. But the output row5 is [8,8,0,0,5,8]. Wait, the appended part is 0,5,8. But row0's reversed is 0,5,8. So maybe row5's first three elements are 8,8,0 (from row0's first element twice and third element) and then reversed row0.\n\nBut how does this fit into a general pattern?\n\nLet me try to see if this applies to other examples.\n\nIn Example1's output:\n\nFirst three rows:\n\n[3,8,2,8,3,3]\n\n[3,2,2,5,2,8]\n\n[8,5,2,2,2,2]\n\nThen rows3-5:\n\n[2,2,2,2,5,8]\n\n[8,2,5,2,2,3]\n\n[3,3,8,2,8,3]\n\nLooking at row4: [8,2,5,2,2,3]. First three elements 8,2,5. Maybe from input row3 (but input has three rows). Input row2 is [8,5,2]. So maybe reversed input row2 is [2,5,8]. Then take first element 2, but row4 starts with 8. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each of the first three output rows is the input row followed by a transformation, and the next three rows are transformations of the input rows in reverse order.\n\nAlternatively, the output is a combination of the original matrix and its rotations or reflections. For example, the first three rows could be the original matrix with each row followed by some transformed elements, and the next three rows are the transposed or rotated matrix with similar transformations.\n\nAlternatively, let's look for a pattern in how the appended three elements are formed for each row.\n\nIn Example0:\n\nRow0: input [8,5,0] \u2192 append [0,8,8]. So third element, first element, first element.\n\nRow1: input [8,5,3] \u2192 append [3,5,5]. Third element, second element, second element.\n\nRow2: input [0,3,2] \u2192 append [2,3,0]. Third element, second element, first element.\n\nHmm, the pattern here varies. For row0, it's third, first, first. Row1: third, second, second. Row2: third, second, first.\n\nThat's inconsistent. Maybe another approach. Let's check if the appended three elements are the reverse of the original row with some modification.\n\nRow0's original is [8,5,0], reversed is [0,5,8]. Appended is [0,8,8]. So first element of reversed (0), then first element of original (8) twice.\n\nRow1's original is [8,5,3], reversed [3,5,8]. Appended [3,5,5]. Take first two elements of reversed (3,5), then repeat 5.\n\nRow2's original [0,3,2], reversed [2,3,0]. Appended [2,3,0], which is exactly reversed. So for row2, it's the reversed original.\n\nHmm, so maybe the pattern is that for each row, the appended part is a modified version of the reversed row, but with some elements replaced.\n\nAlternatively, the first three rows in the output are the input rows with their reversed versions appended, but modified.\n\nBut for row0, reversed is [0,5,8], but appended is [0,8,8]. So first element of reversed, then first element of original twice.\n\nRow1's reversed is [3,5,8], appended [3,5,5]. First two elements from reversed, then repeat second element.\n\nRow2's reversed is [2,3,0], appended exactly. So maybe the pattern for the first three rows is:\n\nAppend reversed original row, but replace the third element of the reversed with the first element of the original (for row0), or something else.\n\nAlternatively, it's possible that the appended part for each row is [third element, first element, first element] for the first row, [third element, second element, second element] for the second row, and [third element, second element, first element] for the third row. But this seems arbitrary.\n\nLet's check Example1:\n\nRow0: input [3,8,2] \u2192 append [8,3,3]. So third element is 2, but appended starts with 8. Wait, this doesn't fit the previous idea. So perhaps that's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, in Example1's first row output:\n\n[3,8,2,8,3,3]. The appended part is 8,3,3. Original row is [3,8,2]. Reversed is [2,8,3]. So appended part is first element of reversed (2) replaced with something else? No, it's 8,3,3. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the appended part for each row is the sum of certain elements. For example, 8 could be the sum of 3 and 5 (but 3+5=8). Not sure. This is getting too vague.\n\nAlternative approach: Let's look at the entire 6x6 output matrix. Maybe it's the original 3x3 matrix in the top-left, and then mirrored or rotated versions in other quadrants.\n\nFor Example0's output:\n\nOriginal 3x3 matrix is:\n\n8 5 0\n\n8 5 3\n\n0 3 2\n\nThe output is:\n\nRow0:8 5 0 0 8 8\n\nRow1:8 5 3 3 5 5\n\nRow2:0 3 2 2 3 0\n\nRow3:0 3 2 2 3 0\n\nRow4:5 5 3 3 5 8\n\nRow5:8 8 0 0 5 8\n\nLooking at this as a 6x6 matrix, perhaps it's arranged as four 3x3 blocks. The first block (top-left) is the original. The top-right block might be a transformed version. The bottom-left and bottom-right could be other transformations.\n\nTop-left 3x3:\n\n8 5 0 | 0 8 8\n\n8 5 3 | 3 5 5\n\n0 3 2 | 2 3 0\n\nThen the next three rows:\n\n0 3 2 | 2 3 0\n\n5 5 3 | 3 5 8\n\n8 8 0 | 0 5 8\n\nHmm, perhaps the bottom-left 3x3 is a rotated or flipped version of the original. For example, flipping the original matrix vertically or horizontally and then applying the same transformation.\n\nAlternatively, the entire 6x6 matrix could be formed by concatenating the original matrix with its mirror image. But I'm not sure.\n\nLet's take Example0's output and see if the right half of the first three rows is related to the original matrix.\n\nRow0's right half:0,8,8. The first element 0 is from row0's third element. Then 8,8 which are from row0's first element.\n\nRow1's right half:3,5,5. Third element of row1 is 3, then 5 (second element), 5 again.\n\nRow2's right half:2,3,0. Which is the reverse of row2's original elements [0,3,2] reversed is [2,3,0].\n\nSo perhaps the first three rows are:\n\nOriginal row followed by [third element, x, y], where x and y depend on the row.\n\nBut row0's x and y are first element. row1's x and y are second element. row2's x is second element and y is first.\n\nThis seems inconsistent, but maybe there's a pattern based on the row's position.\n\nAlternatively, each row is followed by a transformation based on the next row. Let's think about how the appended elements might relate to other rows.\n\nIn Example0, row0's appended elements are 0,8,8. 0 is from row0's third element. 8 could be from row1's first element (which is 8). But then another 8. Not sure.\n\nRow1's appended elements:3 (from row1's third element), 5 (from row1's second), 5 again. So maybe third element, second element repeated.\n\nRow2's appended elements:2 (third element), 3 (second), 0 (first). So third, second, first elements of the original row.\n\nSo perhaps the pattern for the first three rows is:\n\nFor each row i in input:\n\nAppend [third element of row i, second element of row i, first element of row i].\n\nBut for row0 in Example0, that would be [0,5,8], but the appended is [0,8,8]. So that's not matching.\n\nAlternatively, for row0 in Example0, the appended elements are [0,8,8], which is third element, then first element twice. For row1, [3,5,5] \u2192 third, second, second. For row2, [2,3,0] \u2192 third, second, first.\n\nHmm, this seems inconsistent. But maybe there's a rule based on the row's index. For example:\n\n- For even rows (0, 2, etc.), append third, first, first.\n\n- For odd rows (1, etc.), append third, second, second.\n\nBut in Example0, row2 is even index (assuming zero-based), and appended third, second, first. Which doesn't fit. So that's not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the appended elements are derived from the original row and the row below.\n\nFor Example0 row0: original is [8,5,0], row1 is [8,5,3]. So appended elements could be [0 (row0's third), 8 (row1's first), 8 (row1's first)]. That fits [0,8,8].\n\nRow1's appended elements:3 (row1's third), 5 (row2's second?), 5 (row2's second). Because row2 is [0,3,2], so second element is 3. But here it's 5. So that doesn't fit.\n\nHmm, this is confusing. Maybe another approach: Let's look at the test input and see if we can find a pattern by example.\n\nTest input:\n\nRow0: [2,5,0]\n\nRow1: [2,5,1]\n\nRow2: [3,1,1]\n\nAssuming the pattern is for each input row, append certain elements. Let's try to apply what we observed from Example0's first three output rows.\n\nExample0's row0: [8,5,0] \u2192 appended [0,8,8]. Third element, first element twice.\n\nTest input row0: [2,5,0]. Third element is 0, first is 2. So appended would be [0,2,2]. So output row0 would be [2,5,0,0,2,2].\n\nSimilarly, row1 of test input is [2,5,1]. Third element is 1, second is 5. So appended [1,5,5]. So output row1 would be [2,5,1,1,5,5].\n\nRow2 of test input is [3,1,1]. Third element is 1, second is 1, first is 3. So if following row2 of Example0 (third, second, first), then appended would be [1,1,3]. So output row2 would be [3,1,1,1,1,3].\n\nNow, the next three rows (rows3-5) are perhaps transformations of the input rows. Looking at Example0's rows3-5:\n\nRow3 is same as row2. Then row4 is [5,5,3,3,5,8], which could be related to the second input row [8,5,3]. Let's see: first three elements 5,5,3. Maybe the middle element (5) repeated twice, then third element (3). Then appended part [3,5,8], which is the reversed input row1 [8,5,3] reversed is [3,5,8]. So row4's appended part is [3,5,8].\n\nSo for test input's row4, perhaps take the middle element of row1 (which is 5) and repeat it twice, then third element of row1 (1), making [5,5,1]. Then append reversed row1 [1,5,2]. So appended part would be [1,5,2]. So row4 would be [5,5,1,1,5,2].\n\nThen row5 in Example0 is [8,8,0,0,5,8]. The first three elements are first element of row0 (8) repeated twice, then third element of row0 (0). Then append [0,5,8], which is reversed row0. So for test input row5: first three elements [2,2,0], then append [0,5,2]. So row5 would be [2,2,0,0,5,2].\n\nBut I'm not sure if this pattern holds. Let's check Example1's row4 and row5 to see.\n\nExample1's row4 is [8,2,5,2,2,3]. The first three elements could be from input row2 [8,5,2]. If the middle element is 5, but row4 starts with 8,2,5. Not sure. Or maybe it's the reversed input row2 [2,5,8], but then first three elements would be 2,5,8. Not matching.\n\nThis approach might not be correct. Let's think again.\n\nAlternative idea: The output is constructed by mirroring the input matrix both horizontally and vertically and then combining them in some way. For example, the input matrix is placed in the top-left quadrant, and other quadrants are mirrored versions.\n\nBut for a 3x3 matrix, expanding to 6x6 would require four 3x3 quadrants. However, the examples' output rows are 6 elements each, which is 3x2, but they are arranged in 6 rows, so it's 6x6. So perhaps the input is placed in the top-left 3x3, then other parts are transformations.\n\nAlternatively, each row of the output is formed by taking the original row and then appending a transformation of the same row. For example, in Example0's row0: [8,5,0] followed by [0,8,8], which is [third, first, first]. Row1: [8,5,3] \u2192 [3,5,5] (third, second, second). Row2: [0,3,2] \u2192 [2,3,0] (third, second, first).\n\nSo for each row, the appended part is third element, then the element from the same row at position (3 - i -1) where i is the row index? Not sure. Alternatively, perhaps for row0 (index 0), appended elements are third, first, first; row1 (index1), third, second, second; row2 (index2), third, second, first.\n\nIf that's the case, then the pattern for the appended part depends on the row index. For row0, append third, first, first. For row1, append third, second, second. For row2, append third, second, first. Then rows3-5 are transformations of the original rows.\n\nSo for test input:\n\nRow0 (index0): append third (0), first (2), first (2) \u2192 [0,2,2]. So output row0: [2,5,0,0,2,2].\n\nRow1 (index1): append third (1), second (5), second (5) \u2192 [1,5,5]. So output row1: [2,5,1,1,5,5].\n\nRow2 (index2): append third (1), second (1), first (3) \u2192 [1,1,3]. So output row2: [3,1,1,1,1,3].\n\nThen rows3-5 would be transformations. For example, in Example0, row3 is same as row2's output. So maybe row3 is the same as row2's output: [3,1,1,1,1,3].\n\nRow4 and row5 might be based on reversed rows. In Example0, row4 is [5,5,3,3,5,8]. Let's see if this is derived from the input row1 [8,5,3]. Reversed is [3,5,8]. Maybe append third, second, first. Wait for input row1 reversed [3,5,8], third element is 8, second is5, first is3 \u2192 append 8,5,3. So row4's appended part would be 3,5,8. But the example row4 is [5,5,3,3,5,8]. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps row4 is the reversed row1 appended with third, second, first elements of reversed row. For example, input row1 is [8,5,3]. Reversed row is [3,5,8]. Appended part would be third element (8), second (5), first (3) \u2192 [8,5,3]. But row4's appended part is [3,5,8]. So maybe reversed row followed by reversed again.\n\nWait, row4 in Example0 is [5,5,3,3,5,8]. The first three elements are 5,5,3. Where does that come from? Perhaps taking the middle element of row1 (5) repeated twice and then the third element (3). Then appended part is [3,5,8], which is reversed row1.\n\nSo for test input row4, which would be derived from input row1 [2,5,1]. Middle element is 5. So first three elements would be [5,5,1]. Then append reversed row1 [1,5,2]. So row4 would be [5,5,1,1,5,2].\n\nThen row5 in Example0 is [8,8,0,0,5,8]. First three elements are first element of row0 (8) repeated twice, then third element (0). Appended part is [0,5,8], which is reversed row0.\n\nSo for test input row5, first three elements would be [2,2,0] (first element of row0 twice, then third element). Appended part is reversed row0 [0,5,2]. So row5 would be [2,2,0,0,5,2].\n\nPutting this together for the test input, the output would be:\n\nRow0: [2,5,0,0,2,2]\n\nRow1: [2,5,1,1,5,5]\n\nRow2: [3,1,1,1,1,3]\n\nRow3: same as row2 \u2192 [3,1,1,1,1,3]\n\nRow4: [5,5,1,1,5,2]\n\nRow5: [2,2,0,0,5,2]\n\nBut let's check if this matches the pattern of the examples. For Example0, row4 is [5,5,3,3,5,8]. According to this pattern, input row1 is [8,5,3]. Middle element 5. So first three elements 5,5,3. Appended reversed row1 is [3,5,8]. So row4 would be [5,5,3,3,5,8], which matches. Similarly, row5 is [8,8,0,0,5,8]. Which would be first element of row0 (8) twice, then third element (0), then reversed row0 [0,5,8]. So appended part is [0,5,8], but in Example0 row5's appended part is [0,5,8]. So yes, the pattern holds.\n\nSimilarly, in Example1, let's take row4: [8,2,5,2,2,3]. Input row1 is [3,2,2]. Middle element is 2. So first three elements would be [2,2,2]. But the example row4's first three elements are [8,2,5], which doesn't fit. Hmm, maybe this pattern only applies to Example0 and not others. So maybe the pattern is incorrect.\n\nThis suggests that my current approach might not be correct, and I need to think differently.\n\nAlternative idea: Each output row is the original row followed by a combination of elements from other rows. For example, the first three output rows are input rows with appended elements from other rows.\n\nBut I'm not sure. Let's think about the number of elements. Each output row has six elements. The first three are the input row, and the next three are some combination. For the test input, let's try to generate the output based on the examples.\n\nAnother observation: In Example0's output, the fourth row is [5,5,3,3,5,8]. The first three elements are 5,5,3. The fifth element is 5 (from input row1's second element), and 8 (from input row0's first element). Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the output matrix is a 6x6 matrix formed by placing the input matrix in the top-left, its mirror image in the top-right, the mirror image's transpose in the bottom-left, and the input's transpose in the bottom-right. This is a common matrix transformation, but I'm not sure if that applies here.\n\nAlternatively, the output is created by doubling each row and column. For example, each element is repeated or transformed in a certain way to expand the matrix.\n\nBut given the complexity, I think the best approach is to hypothesize that each input row is transformed into two output rows by appending certain elements based on their position, and the lower three rows are transformations of the input.\n\nBased on the previous pattern from Example0 and the test input, let's proceed with the following:\n\nFor each input row:\n\n- Row0: append [third, first, first]\n\n- Row1: append [third, second, second]\n\n- Row2: append [third, second, first]\n\nThen, the next three rows are transformations of the input rows in reverse order, applying similar rules.\n\nFor example, in Example0, the fourth row is derived from input row1 [8,5,3], but perhaps reversed. So reversed row1 is [3,5,8], then append [third, first, first]. For [3,5,8], third is 8, first is 3 \u2192 append 8,3,3. So row would be [3,5,8,8,3,3]. But Example0's row4 is [5,5,3,3,5,8]. This doesn't match. So this approach might be incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the lower three rows are formed by taking the reversed input rows and applying the same append rules.\n\nFor test input:\n\nRow3 would be row2's appended part plus reversed appended part.\n\nAlternatively, after the first three rows, the next three are generated by taking the input rows in reverse order and applying the append rules.\n\nFor example, input rows are row0, row1, row2. Reversed order is row2, row1, row0. For each of these reversed rows, apply the append pattern based on their new position.\n\nFor test input:\n\nReversed input rows would be [3,1,1], [2,5,1], [2,5,0].\n\nThen:\n\nRow3: [3,1,1] \u2192 as row0 in reversed input, append [third, first, first]. Third element is 1, first is 3 \u2192 append [1,3,3]. So row3: [3,1,1,1,3,3].\n\nRow4: [2,5,1] \u2192 row1 in reversed input, append [third, second, second]. Third element is 1, second is5 \u2192 append [1,5,5]. So row4: [2,5,1,1,5,5].\n\nRow5: [2,5,0] \u2192 row2 in reversed input, append [third, second, first]. Third element 0, second 5, first 2 \u2192 append [0,5,2]. So row5: [2,5,0,0,5,2].\n\nBut in Example0, row3 is same as row2's output, which would be [0,3,2,2,3,0], and row4 is [5,5,3,3,5,8], which doesn't fit this pattern. So this approach may not work.\n\nThis is really challenging. Maybe another way: Each output row is the input row followed by a transformation that depends on the next row's elements.\n\nBut without more examples, it's hard to see. Given the time I have, I'll proceed with the initial pattern I thought of for the first three rows and then apply similar logic for the next three rows based on reversed input.\n\nSo for the test input:\n\nFirst three rows:\n\nRow0: [2,5,0] \u2192 append [0,2,2] \u2192 [2,5,0,0,2,2]\n\nRow1: [2,5,1] \u2192 append [1,5,5] \u2192 [2,5,1,1,5,5]\n\nRow2: [3,1,1] \u2192 append [1,1,3] \u2192 [3,1,1,1,1,3]\n\nThen rows3-5:\n\nRow3: reverse of row2 \u2192 [1,1,3], append [3,1,1] \u2192 [1,1,3,3,1,1]. But in Example0, row3 is same as row2. So maybe row3 is same as row2's output: [3,1,1,1,1,3].\n\nRow4: reverse of row1 \u2192 [1,5,2], append [2,5,1] \u2192 [1,5,2,2,5,1]. But Example0's row4 is [5,5,3,3,5,8], which doesn't fit. Alternatively, reversed row1 is [1,5,2], then append third, first, first \u2192 [2,1,1]. So row4: [1,5,2,2,1,1]. Not sure.\n\nRow5: reverse of row0 \u2192 [0,5,2], append [0,2,2]. So row5: [0,5,2,0,2,2]. But Example0's row5 is [8,8,0,0,5,8], which doesn't match. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, for the lower three rows, they are the reversed original rows with their own append rules.\n\nBut I'm not confident. Given the time, I'll proceed with the first three rows as per the initial pattern and assume the next three are transformations of the input rows, possibly reversed and appended similarly.\n\nTest input output:\n\nRow0: [2,5,0,0,2,2]\n\nRow1: [2,5,1,1,5,5]\n\nRow2: [3,1,1,1,1,3]\n\nRow3: [3,1,1,1,1,3] (same as row2)\n\nRow4: [5,5,1,1,5,2] (from row1's elements transformed)\n\nRow5: [2,2,0,0,5,2] (from row0's elements transformed)\n\nThis matches the pattern observed in Example0. Although not sure about the exact transformation for rows4 and 5, but based on the examples, this seems plausible."
