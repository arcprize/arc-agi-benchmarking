        "cot_1": "Okay, let's see. I need to figure out the pattern that transforms the input lists into the output lists in the training examples. Then apply that pattern to the test input. Let's start by looking at the training examples.\n\nFirst, looking at Example 0. The input has three lists. Let's compare the input and output for each list.\n\nTake the first input list of Example 0:\nInput: [1, 1, 2, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0]\nOutput: [1, 1, 2, 5, 4, 4, 1, 5, 1, 4, 4]\n\nNoticing that the first four elements (1,1,2,5) remain the same in the output. Then the next three zeros (positions 4-6) become 4,4,1. Then comes 5 again (same as input), and the last three zeros (positions 8-10) become 1,4,4.\n\nHmm, where do those numbers come from? Let's check the other lists in the same example. The second input list in Example 0 is [4,1,1,5,0,0,0,5,0,0,0], output [4,1,1,5,4,1,1,5,1,1,4]. Again, the first four are same. The next three zeros become 4,1,1. Then the 5, then the next three zeros become 1,1,4.\n\nLooking at the third input of Example 0: [4,4,1,5,0,0,0,5,0,0,0] becomes [4,4,1,5,1,1,2,5,2,1,1]. So again, first four same. Then zeros become 1,1,2. Then 5, then zeros become 2,1,1.\n\nNow, trying to find a pattern here. The zeros in positions 4-6 and 8-10 are being replaced. Maybe the replacement numbers come from other parts of the input. Let's look across the different lists in the same example. For instance, in Example 0's first output, the 4 in position 4 comes from where? Looking at the other input lists. The second input list starts with 4, maybe that's a clue.\n\nWait, the input in Example 0 has three different lists. The outputs seem to be combining elements from different lists. For instance, the first output's 4,4,1 in positions 4-6 might be taking elements from the second or third input lists. Let's check:\n\nIn Example 0:\n\nFirst input list: [1,1,2,5,...]\nSecond input list: [4,1,1,5,...]\nThird input list: [4,4,1,5,...]\n\nThe first output's positions 4-6 are 4,4,1. The second input's first three elements are 4,1,1. The third input's first three are 4,4,1. So maybe the output is taking elements from other lists. Let's see:\n\nFor the first output list in Example 0, maybe the replaced zeros (positions 4-6) are taking the first three elements of the next input lists. Like, the second input's first three are 4,1,1, but in the first output, positions 4-6 are 4,4,1. Hmm, maybe not exactly. Alternatively, perhaps each output list is derived by combining elements from the other input lists.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each position in the output is generated based on some operation across the corresponding positions in the input lists. Let's check.\n\nLooking at the first output of Example 0:\n\nOutput positions 4: 4. The input lists for position 4 are 0 (from first list), 0 (second), 0 (third). But output is 4. Hmm, not obvious. Maybe the zeros are replaced by elements from the previous lists. Wait, but how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the three input lists are being rotated or shifted in some way. Let's look at the output lists. For Example 0:\n\nEach output list has the first four elements same as their input. Then, the next three elements (positions 4-6) are filled with elements from other input lists. For example, first output's positions 4-6 are 4,4,1. Looking at the other input lists, maybe the second input's first three elements (4,1,1) and third input's (4,4,1) contribute here. Maybe taking the first element from the next list, then second, etc.\n\nAlternatively, the output lists are built by taking elements from the next input lists in a cycle. For instance, the first output list takes elements from the second input list, the second output takes from the third, and the third takes from the first. Let me check.\n\nFirst output in Example 0: [1,1,2,5,4,4,1,5,1,4,4]. The elements after the 5s (positions 4-6 and 8-10) could be taking from the other input lists. The 4,4,1 in positions 4-6 match the third input's first three elements (4,4,1). The 1,4,4 in positions 8-10 could be from the second input's elements. Wait, second input's first three are 4,1,1. Not exactly. Alternatively, maybe the replacement elements are the first three elements of the next list. For example, first output's 4,4,1 could be the third input's first three. Because the first input is the first list, then the next is second, then third. But how are they combined?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each output list is a transformation where the zeros are replaced by elements from the corresponding positions of other input lists. Let's take Example 0's first output. The zeros in the first input are replaced as follows:\n\nOriginal input: positions 4-6 (0,0,0) become 4,4,1. The other input lists' position 4-6 are also zeros. So maybe not that.\n\nWait, maybe the three input lists are used to generate three output lists by some rotation. For example, each output list's replaced zeros come from the elements of the next input list. Let's see:\n\nIn Example 0, the first input list's zeros (positions 4-6, 8-10) are replaced by 4,4,1 and 1,4,4. The second input list's first three elements are 4,1,1. The third's are 4,4,1. So perhaps the first output's 4,4,1 comes from the third input's first three, and the next part (1,4,4) from the second input's elements. Hmm, but how?\n\nAlternatively, looking at the output elements:\n\nIn Example 0's first output, positions 4-6: 4,4,1. The third input list's first three are 4,4,1. So maybe each output list takes the first three elements from another list's first three. Then, positions 8-10: 1,4,4. The second input's first three elements are 4,1,1. Maybe reversed? 1,1,4 reversed gives 4,1,1. No. Wait, positions 8-10: 1,4,4. Maybe the first input's first three elements are 1,1,2. Not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each output list's replacement parts are derived from the next input lists. Let's look at the three output lists in Example 0:\n\nOutput list 1: [1,1,2,5,4,4,1,5,1,4,4]\nOutput list 2: [4,1,1,5,4,1,1,5,1,1,4]\nOutput list 3: [4,4,1,5,1,1,2,5,2,1,1]\n\nLooking at the replaced parts (positions 4-6 and 8-10):\n\nFor output 1, 4-6: 4,4,1. Third input list's first three are 4,4,1. Output 2's 4-6:4,1,1. The first input list's first three are 1,1,2. Hmm, not matching. Alternatively, output 2's 4-6:4,1,1. The second input list is [4,1,1,5,...], so first three 4,1,1. So maybe output list 2's 4-6 is taken from the second input's first three. But why?\n\nWait, maybe each output list's replaced parts are taken from the first three elements of the next input list. Let's see:\n\nIn Example 0, three input lists:\n\nList 1: [1,1,2,5,0,0,0,5,0,0,0]\nList 2: [4,1,1,5,0,0,0,5,0,0,0]\nList 3: [4,4,1,5,0,0,0,5,0,0,0]\n\nOutput lists:\n\nOutput 1: for positions 4-6 (original zeros), maybe taking from list 2's first three elements (4,1,1). But output 1's 4-6 is 4,4,1. Which is list3's first three (4,4,1). Then positions 8-10:1,4,4. Maybe list2's elements 4,1,1 but reversed? 1,1,4? No. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output lists are generated by rotating the input lists. Let's consider that each output list is formed by combining elements from the other two input lists. For example, output list 1's replaced parts come from list2 and list3.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each replaced zero is filled with the sum of the corresponding elements from the other lists. Let's check:\n\nIn Example0, first output's positions4:4. The input lists' positions4 are 0,0,0. Sum is 0, but output is 4. Not matching.\n\nAlternatively, the replaced zeros are filled with the first three elements of the next list. Like, output list1's positions4-6 are list2's first three elements. Let's check:\n\nList2's first three are 4,1,1. Output list1's positions4-6 are 4,4,1. Not matching. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each output list uses the first three elements of the next list in the sequence, then wraps around. For example, output list1 (first output) uses list2's first three for positions4-6, but output list1 has 4,4,1 in positions4-6. List3's first three are 4,4,1. So maybe output list1 uses list3's first three here. Then output list2 (second output) uses list3's first three for their positions4-6? Let's check output list2's positions4-6:4,1,1. List3's first three are 4,4,1. Not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each output list's replaced zeros are filled with the elements from the previous lists. For instance, output list1's 4-6 are from list3's first three elements. Because list3 is after list2, but maybe there's a rotation. This is getting confusing.\n\nLet me look at another example to see if there's a clearer pattern. Example 1:\n\nInput lists:\n\nFirst input list: [6,3,3,5,0,0,0,5,0,0,0]\nSecond: same as first.\nThird: [6,3,2,5,0,0,0,5,0,0,0]\n\nOutputs:\n\nFirst output: [6,3,3,5,6,6,6,5,2,3,6]\nSecond output: [6,3,3,5,3,3,3,5,3,3,6]\nThird output: [6,3,2,5,2,3,3,5,3,3,6]\n\nLooking at the first output's positions4-6:6,6,6. The input lists here: first and second have 6,3,3; third has 6,3,2. So where do the 6s come from? Maybe taking the first element of the first input (6) and repeating it. But why?\n\nAlternatively, the replaced zeros are filled with the first element of the input list. For example, the first input list starts with 6, so positions4-6 become 6,6,6. The third input list starts with 6, so maybe in the third output's positions4-6, 2,3,3. Wait, the third output's positions4-6 are 2,3,3, which matches the third input's third element (2) followed by 3,3? Not sure.\n\nWait, let's look at the first output list in Example1. The replaced positions4-6 are 6,6,6. The first input list's first element is 6. So maybe each of those positions is filled with the first element of the input list. Then, positions8-10 are 2,3,6. The third input list's first three elements are 6,3,2. Maybe reversed? 2,3,6. Oh, 6,3,2 reversed is 2,3,6. That matches positions8-10. So perhaps:\n\nIn each output list, the zeros in positions4-6 are replaced by the first element of the input list repeated three times. Then the zeros in positions8-10 are replaced by the reversed first three elements of the next input list.\n\nWait, let's test this hypothesis with Example0's first output. The first input list is [1,1,2,5, ...]. So positions4-6 would be 1,1,1. But the actual output is 4,4,1. So that doesn't fit. So maybe that's not the pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each output list's replaced zeros (positions4-6 and8-10) are filled with the first three elements of the other input lists. Let's check Example1's first output:\n\nPositions4-6:6,6,6. Maybe from the first input's first element (6) repeated three times. Positions8-10:2,3,6. The third input list's first three elements are6,3,2. Reversed, that's 2,3,6. So maybe that's the case.\n\nSimilarly, in Example1's second output list: positions4-6 are3,3,3. The second input list's first element is3? No, the second input list starts with6. Wait, the second input list is [6,3,3,5,...]. So first element is6. But the output's positions4-6 are3,3,3. Hmm, that doesn't fit. Unless it's taking the second element. The second element is3. So three times 3. Then positions8-10 are3,3,6. Third input's first three elements reversed is2,3,6. So 3,3,6 would be part of that reversed list? Not sure.\n\nAnother approach: For each output list, the positions4-6 and8-10 are transformed based on the other input lists. Let's see how.\n\nIn Example0's first output list:\n\nThe replaced parts are 4,4,1 and1,4,4. These could be parts of other input lists. The third input list's first three elements are4,4,1. So positions4-6 are taken from there. Then the second input list's first three are4,1,1. If we take those and reverse them, we get1,1,4. But the output has1,4,4. Not exactly. Maybe there's a different arrangement.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the three input lists are treated as a group, and each output list is formed by taking the first three elements of the next list in sequence for the positions4-6, and the first three elements of the previous list reversed for positions8-10.\n\nFor Example0:\n\nInput lists are list0, list1, list2.\n\nOutput list0's positions4-6: list2's first three (4,4,1).\npositions8-10: list1's first three reversed (1,1,4) \u2192 reversed is4,1,1. But the output is1,4,4. Doesn't match.\n\nHmm, not exactly.\n\nLooking at Example2's first output:\n\nInput lists:\n[2,7,8,5,0,0,0,5,0,0,0]\n[7,7,8,5,0,0,0,5,0,0,0]\n[8,8,8,5,0,0,0,5,0,0,0]\n\nOutput:\n[2,7,8,5,8,7,2,5,8,8,8]\n\nPositions4-6:8,7,2. The third input list's first three are8,8,8. So not directly matching. The second input list's first three are7,7,8. Also not. The first input list's first three are2,7,8. Reversed is8,7,2. Oh! That's exactly positions4-6:8,7,2. Then positions8-10:8,8,8. Which is the third input list's first three elements. So maybe:\n\nFor each output list, positions4-6 are the reversed first three elements of the previous input list, and positions8-10 are the first three elements of the next input list.\n\nWait, let's check this.\n\nExample2's first output list:\n\nPositions4-6:8,7,2. The previous input list would be the third one (since there are three lists, perhaps previous is the one before in a cycle). Wait, the input lists are list0, list1, list2. For output list0, previous would be list2 (since it's a cycle). So list2's first three are8,8,8. Reversed would be8,8,8. Not matching. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, output list0's positions4-6 are the reversed first three of list0's own input. The first input list's first three are2,7,8. Reversed is8,7,2. Which matches positions4-6. Then positions8-10:8,8,8. Which is the third input list's first three.\n\nSo perhaps for each output list:\n\n- The first four elements are the same as the input.\n- Positions4-6 are the reversed first three elements of the input list's own first three.\n- Positions8-10 are the first three elements of the next input list.\n\nBut let's test this with Example0's first output.\n\nInput list0's first three are1,1,2. Reversed is2,1,1. But positions4-6 are4,4,1. Doesn't match. So that can't be.\n\nAnother angle: Let's check all the replaced positions.\n\nFor Example0's first output:\n\npositions4-6:4,4,1. Looking at the other input lists. The third input list (list2) has first three4,4,1. So that's a match. Then positions8-10:1,4,4. The second input list (list1) has first three4,1,1. Reversed is1,1,4. But the output here is1,4,4. Not matching.\n\nBut perhaps for the first output list, positions4-6 are taken from list2's first three, and positions8-10 from list1's first three but reversed. 4,1,1 reversed is1,1,4. But output is1,4,4. Not quite.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each output list's positions4-6 are taken from the next list's first three elements, and positions8-10 from the previous list's first three elements. Let's see:\n\nExample0's first output list:\n\nNext list after list0 is list1. List1's first three:4,1,1. So positions4-6 should be4,1,1. But output is4,4,1. Doesn't fit.\n\nWait, maybe the first output list in Example0 uses list2's first three elements for positions4-6. List2's first three are4,4,1. Which matches the 4,4,1 in positions4-6. Then positions8-10:1,4,4. Which is list1's first three elements (4,1,1) reversed? No. 4,1,1 reversed is1,1,4. Not matching.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the replaced zeros are filled by elements from the other lists in a specific order. Let's think of the three input lists as list0, list1, list2. For the output, each list's zeros are replaced by elements from the other lists in a rotating fashion.\n\nFor example, for the first output list (list0's output), positions4-6 are filled with list2's first three elements (4,4,1). Positions8-10 are filled with list1's first three elements reversed (4,1,1 reversed to 1,1,4) but that gives1,1,4. But output is1,4,4. Not matching.\n\nAlternatively, the positions8-10 are filled with list2's first three elements in reverse. 4,4,1 reversed is1,4,4. Which matches the output's 1,4,4. So:\n\nFor list0's output:\npositions4-6: list2's first three elements (4,4,1)\npositions8-10: list2's first three reversed (1,4,4)\n\nBut list0's output's positions8-10 are1,4,4, which matches list2's first three reversed. That seems to fit. Let's check for other examples.\n\nExample1's first output list:\n\npositions4-6:6,6,6. Which input list's first three elements are6,6,6? None. But the third input list's first three are6,3,2. Reversed gives2,3,6. Not matching. Alternatively, maybe list1's first three are6,3,3. Reversed is3,3,6. Not 6,6,6. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe the pattern is different. Let's look at Example1's first output:\n\nInput lists are:\n\nlist0: [6,3,3,5, ...]\nlist1: same as list0.\nlist2: [6,3,2,5, ...]\n\nOutput list0: positions4-6:6,6,6. positions8-10:2,3,6.\n\nIf list0's output's positions4-6 are list0's first element (6) repeated three times. Then positions8-10 are list2's first three elements reversed (6,3,2 \u2192 2,3,6). Which matches the output's 2,3,6. So that could be a pattern.\n\nFor positions4-6: take the first element of the input list and repeat it three times.\n\nFor positions8-10: take the first three elements of the next input list (in a cyclic order) and reverse them.\n\nLet's test this hypothesis across all examples.\n\nExample0's first output list (input list0):\n\npositions4-6: first element is1 \u2192 repeat three times \u21921,1,1. But the output is4,4,1. So this doesn't fit. So that's not it.\n\nAlternatively, maybe positions4-6 are the first three elements of the next input list. For list0, next list is list1. list1's first three are4,1,1. So positions4-6 should be4,1,1. But output has4,4,1. So not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe positions4-6 are the first three elements of the previous input list. For list0, previous would be list2 (cyclic). list2's first three are4,4,1. So positions4-6 are4,4,1. Which matches. positions8-10: next list after list0 is list1. list1's first three are4,1,1. Reverse is1,1,4. But output is1,4,4. Doesn't fit.\n\nHmm.\n\nLet me look at another example. Example2's first output list:\n\npositions4-6:8,7,2. The input list0's first three are2,7,8. Reversed is8,7,2. So positions4-6 are the reversed first three of the input list. positions8-10:8,8,8. list2's first three are8,8,8. So it's using list2's first three here. So the pattern could be:\n\nFor each output list:\n\n- positions4-6: reversed first three elements of the input list.\n\n- positions8-10: first three elements of the next input list (cyclically, so after list2 comes list0).\n\nLet's check if this works for other examples.\n\nExample0's first output list:\n\ninput list0's first three:1,1,2 \u2192 reversed is2,1,1. But positions4-6 are4,4,1. Doesn't fit. So no.\n\nExample1's first output list:\n\ninput list0's first three:6,3,3 \u2192 reversed is3,3,6. But output's positions4-6 are6,6,6. Doesn't fit.\n\nSo this hypothesis is invalid.\n\nAnother approach: Let's look at the positions4-6 and8-10 in outputs and see if they relate to the other input lists.\n\nIn Example0's first output list:\n\npositions4-6:4,4,1. Looking at the other input lists:\n\nlist1's first three:4,1,1.\n\nlist2's first three:4,4,1.\n\nSo positions4-6 of output list0 are list2's first three elements. positions8-10:1,4,4. Which is list1's first three elements (4,1,1) reversed (1,1,4) but output is1,4,4. Not exactly.\n\nExample0's second output list (output list1):\n\npositions4-6:4,1,1 \u2192 which matches list1's first three elements (4,1,1). positions8-10:1,1,4 \u2192 which could be list0's first three (1,1,2) reversed (2,1,1), but no. Or list2's first three (4,4,1) reversed (1,4,4). Also not.\n\nWait, output list1's positions8-10 are1,1,4. list0's first three elements are1,1,2. So maybe taking the first two elements and adding 4? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each output list's positions4-6 and8-10 are filled with the first three elements of the other two input lists. For example, in Example0's first output list:\n\npositions4-6: list2's first three (4,4,1).\n\npositions8-10: list1's first three (4,1,1) \u2192 but output is1,4,4. Maybe reversed and rotated?\n\nAlternatively, the three output lists in each example are created by taking elements from all three input lists in a certain way. Let's think of the three output lists as transformations of all three inputs together.\n\nFor instance, in Example0, the three input lists have first three elements:\n\nlist0:1,1,2\n\nlist1:4,1,1\n\nlist2:4,4,1\n\nThen, the three output lists' positions4-6 and8-10 are:\n\noutput0:4,4,1 and1,4,4 \u2192 list2 and list1 elements?\n\noutput1:4,1,1 and1,1,4 \u2192 list1 and list0's elements?\n\noutput2:1,1,2 and2,1,1 \u2192 list0 and list2's elements?\n\nHmm, maybe the first part (positions4-6) for each output list is taken from the next input list's first three, and positions8-10 from the previous input list's first three reversed.\n\nLet's check:\n\nIn Example0:\n\noutput0's positions4-6: list1's first three? list1's first three are4,1,1. But output0's positions4-6 are4,4,1. Which is list2's first three.\n\noutput0's positions8-10: list2's first three reversed (1,4,4) \u2192 yes.\n\noutput1's positions4-6: list2's first three (4,4,1) \u2192 but output1's are4,1,1. No.\n\nAlternatively, output0's positions4-6 are list2's first three, positions8-10 are list1's first three reversed.\n\nlist1's first three reversed:1,1,4. But output0's positions8-10 are1,4,4. Not matching.\n\nThis is getting too complicated. Let's try to find another approach.\n\nLooking at the test input:\n\nTest Input:\n\n[3,3,9,5,0,0,0,5,0,0,0]\n\n[9,9,9,5,0,0,0,5,0,0,0]\n\n[2,9,9,5,0,0,0,5,0,0,0]\n\nExpected to generate three output lists.\n\nLet's hypothesize that in the output, positions4-6 and8-10 are filled with elements derived from the other input lists' first three elements. Maybe each output list's positions4-6 are the previous input list's first three reversed, and positions8-10 are the next input list's first three elements. Let's see.\n\nFor the first test input list (list0):\n\nprevious list would be the third (cyclic), which is [2,9,9,5,...]. first three:2,9,9 \u2192 reversed is9,9,2. So positions4-6 would be9,9,2.\n\nnext list is list1: [9,9,9,5,...]. first three:9,9,9 \u2192 positions8-10 would be9,9,9.\n\nBut let's check against the training examples.\n\nExample0's first output:\n\nlist0's positions4-6:4,4,1. If the previous list is list2's first three reversed:4,4,1 \u2192 list2's first three are4,4,1. Reversed is1,4,4. Doesn't match. So that's not it.\n\nAnother idea: For each output list, the replaced zeros (positions4-6 and8-10) are filled with the first three elements of the other two input lists in some order. For example, the first output list uses list1 and list2's elements.\n\nAlternatively, each output list's positions4-6 and8-10 are formed by taking the first three elements of the other two lists, concatenated. Like, for Example0's first output, positions4-6 are list2's first three (4,4,1), positions8-10 are list1's first three (4,1,1), but that's 4,1,1, which doesn't match the output's1,4,4. So maybe reversed.\n\nIf positions4-6 are list2's first three, and positions8-10 are reversed list1's first three (4,1,1 \u2192 1,1,4), but output has1,4,4. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe for each output list i, the replaced zeros are filled with the first three elements of list (i+1) mod3 and list (i-1) mod3, reversed.\n\nFor Example0's first output (i=0):\n\npositions4-6: list1's first three (4,1,1) \u2192 no.\n\nWait, I'm stuck. Let me look for another pattern.\n\nLooking at Example0's outputs:\n\noutput0: [1,1,2,5,4,4,1,5,1,4,4]\n\noutput1: [4,1,1,5,4,1,1,5,1,1,4]\n\noutput2: [4,4,1,5,1,1,2,5,2,1,1]\n\nNotice that in output0's positions4-6:4,4,1 \u2192 which matches list2's first three elements. positions8-10:1,4,4 \u2192 which is list1's first three (4,1,1) but reversed and maybe with some changes. Or perhaps it's list0's first three elements (1,1,2) \u2192 2,1,1 but not matching.\n\nExample1's outputs:\n\noutput0: [6,3,3,5,6,6,6,5,2,3,6]\n\npositions4-6:6,6,6 \u2192 perhaps the first element (6) repeated three times.\n\npositions8-10:2,3,6 \u2192 which is list2's first three (6,3,2) reversed \u21922,3,6.\n\nSo for Example1's output0:\n\npositions4-6:6 repeated thrice.\n\npositions8-10: reversed list2's first three.\n\nIf this is the case, then the pattern might be:\n\nFor each output list i:\n\n- positions4-6: first element of list i's input, repeated three times.\n\n- positions8-10: reversed first three elements of list i+1's input.\n\nLet's test this hypothesis.\n\nExample0's output0:\n\nlist0's input first element is1. So positions4-6 should be1,1,1. But output is4,4,1. Doesn't fit. So no.\n\nExample1's output0: first element is6 \u2192 positions4-6:6,6,6. That fits.\n\npositions8-10: list1's first three (6,3,3) reversed \u21923,3,6. But output is2,3,6. Doesn't match. Wait, list2's first three are6,3,2. Reversed is2,3,6. Which matches the output's positions8-10. So perhaps for output list i, positions8-10 are the reversed first three of list i+1's input.\n\nIn Example1, output list0 (i=0) would take list1's input. But list1's first three are6,3,3. Reversed is3,3,6. Not matching. But output is2,3,6, which is list2's input first three reversed. So perhaps for output list i, positions8-10 are the reversed first three of list i+1 mod3's input.\n\nYes. Because for output list0 (i=0), i+1 mod3 is1. So list1's first three are6,3,3 \u2192 reversed 3,3,6. But output is2,3,6. Doesn't match. So that's not correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's the next list's first three elements. For output list0, next list is list1. But in Example1, list1's first three are6,3,3. reversed is3,3,6. Not matching output's2,3,6. So no.\n\nExample2's output0: positions4-6 are8,7,2. list0's first three are2,7,8. reversed is8,7,2. So that matches. positions8-10 are8,8,8, which is list2's first three elements. So perhaps:\n\npositions4-6: reversed first three of own input.\n\npositions8-10: first three of next list.\n\nExample2's output0:\n\npositions4-6: reversed own input's first three (2,7,8 \u21928,7,2).\n\npositions8-10: next list (list1) has first three7,7,8 \u2192 which would be7,7,8. But output is8,8,8. Doesn't match. So no.\n\nBut the output's positions8-10 are8,8,8, which is list2's first three. So if next list is list2's, but why?\n\nAnother observation: in all examples, the outputs have the first four elements unchanged, then positions4-6 and8-10 filled with some values, and position7 is always 5.\n\nLooking at the replaced parts: positions4-6 and8-10. Each is three elements long.\n\nNow, looking for a pattern where the three zeros in positions4-6 are replaced by the first three elements of another list, possibly reversed, and the three zeros in positions8-10 are replaced similarly.\n\nIn Example0's output0:\n\npositions4-6:4,4,1 (list2's first three)\n\npositions8-10:1,4,4 (list2's first three reversed?)\n\nYes, list2's first three are4,4,1. reversed is1,4,4. Which matches positions8-10. So for output list0, both replaced sections are from list2's first three and its reverse.\n\nExample0's output1:\n\npositions4-6:4,1,1 (list1's first three)\n\npositions8-10:1,1,4 (list1's first three reversed)\n\nYes, list1's first three are4,1,1 \u2192 reversed is1,1,4. Output positions8-10 are1,1,4.\n\nExample0's output2:\n\npositions4-6:1,1,2 (list0's first three)\n\nreversed is2,1,1 \u2192 but output positions4-6 are1,1,2. No. Wait, list0's first three are1,1,2. reversed is2,1,1. But output's positions4-6 are1,1,2. Not reversed. Hmm, but example0's output2's positions4-6 are1,1,2, which is the same as list0's first three. So that doesn't fit.\n\nWait, no. Output2's positions4-6 are1,1,2. Which matches list0's first three. But the replaced zeros are in positions4-6. So output list2's positions4-6 are list0's first three elements. Then positions8-10 are2,1,1. Which is list0's first three reversed (2,1,1). So perhaps:\n\nFor each output list i:\n\npositions4-6: list i-1's first three elements.\n\npositions8-10: list i-1's first three elements reversed.\n\nBut for example0's output0:\n\ni=0, list-1 would be list2 (since it's cyclic). list2's first three are4,4,1. So positions4-6 would be4,4,1 (matches output0). positions8-10:1,4,4 (reversed). Which matches.\n\nFor output1 (i=1):\n\nlist i-1 = list0. list0's first three are1,1,2. So positions4-6:1,1,2. But output1's positions4-6 are4,1,1. Doesn't fit. So this hypothesis is invalid.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for each output list i:\n\npositions4-6: list i+1's first three elements.\n\npositions8-10: list i+1's first three reversed.\n\nExample0's output0 (i=0):\n\nlist1's first three:4,1,1. So positions4-6 would be4,1,1. But output0's are4,4,1. Doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. This is really challenging.\n\nAlternative approach: let's look at the output lists in each example and see if the replaced numbers form a pattern.\n\nIn Example0's outputs:\n\n- The replaced parts in each output list seem to be combinations of the first three elements of the input lists, possibly rotated and reversed.\n\nLooking at all three output lists in Example0:\n\nOutput0:4,4,1 and1,4,4 \u2192 which are the same as list2's first three and reversed.\n\nOutput1:4,1,1 and1,1,4 \u2192 list1's first three and reversed.\n\nOutput2:1,1,2 and2,1,1 \u2192 list0's first three and reversed.\n\nAh! So for output list i, the replaced parts (positions4-6 and8-10) are list (i+1) mod3's first three elements and their reversed version.\n\nLet's check:\n\nExample0:\n\noutput0 (i=0):\n\nlist (0+1) mod3 = list1. list1's first three are4,1,1. But positions4-6 are4,4,1. So no.\n\nAlternatively, output list i uses list i+1's first three for positions4-6 and list i-1's first three reversed for positions8-10.\n\nFor output0 (i=0):\n\nlist1's first three:4,1,1 \u2192 positions4-6:4,4,1. Not matching. But list2's first three:4,4,1. So perhaps i+2 mod3.\n\nAlternatively, each output list uses list i+2's first three for positions4-6 and list i+2's first three reversed for positions8-10.\n\nFor example, output0 (i=0):\n\nlist0+2= list2's first three:4,4,1 \u2192 positions4-6:4,4,1.\n\n reversed is1,4,4 \u2192 positions8-10:1,4,4. Which matches.\n\n output1 (i=1):\n\n list1+2= list3 mod3= list0's first three:1,1,2 \u2192 positions4-6:4,1,1. Wait, no. list0's first three are1,1,2. So no.\n\nAlternatively, maybe output list i uses list i's first three for positions4-6 and list i's first three reversed for positions8-10.\n\nIn example0's output0: list0's first three are1,1,2. reversed is2,1,1. But output positions4-6 are4,4,1. So no.\n\nThis is getting frustrating. Maybe I'm missing a simpler pattern.\n\nLooking at the replaced parts again in all examples, perhaps the positions4-6 and8-10 in each output list are the first three elements of the other two input lists, in some order.\n\nFor example, in Example0's output0:\n\npositions4-6:4,4,1 (list2's first three)\n\npositions8-10:1,4,4 (list1's first three reversed)\n\nBut list1's first three are4,1,1. Reversed is1,1,4. Not matching.\n\nExample1's output0:\n\npositions4-6:6,6,6 \u2192 list0's first element repeated three times.\n\npositions8-10:2,3,6 \u2192 list2's first three reversed (6,3,2 \u2192 reversed is2,3,6).\n\nExample1's output1:\n\npositions4-6:3,3,3 \u2192 list1's second element (3) repeated three times?\n\n positions8-10:3,3,6 \u2192 list0's first three reversed (6,3,3 \u2192 reversed is3,3,6).\n\nExample1's output2:\n\npositions4-6:2,3,3 \u2192 list2's third element is2, followed by list0's elements 3,3. Not sure.\n\nBut in Example1's output2, positions4-6:2,3,3. list2's first three are6,3,2 \u2192 reversed is2,3,6. But positions4-6 are2,3,3. Not matching.\n\nAnother idea: The replaced parts are formed by using the first three elements of the previous list and the next list in a certain way. For example, positions4-6 are previous list's first three elements, and positions8-10 are next list's first three elements reversed.\n\nBut in Example0's output0:\n\nprevious list is list2 (4,4,1), positions4-6:4,4,1 (matches).\n\nnext list is list1 (4,1,1), reversed is1,1,4 \u2192 positions8-10:1,4,4. Not matching. But output is1,4,4.\n\nHmm, close but not exact.\n\nAlternatively, previous list's first three reversed for positions4-6 and next list's first three for positions8-10.\n\nExample0's output0:\n\nprevious list2's first three reversed:1,4,4 \u2192 positions4-6:4,4,1. No.\n\nNot helpful.\n\nLet me think of the test input. The test input is:\n\nlist0: [3,3,9,5,0,0,0,5,0,0,0]\n\nlist1: [9,9,9,5,0,0,0,5,0,0,0]\n\nlist2: [2,9,9,5,0,0,0,5,0,0,0]\n\nAssuming the pattern from Example1's output0, where positions4-6 are the first element repeated thrice and positions8-10 are the next list's first three reversed.\n\nFor list0:\n\nfirst element is3 \u2192 positions4-6:3,3,3.\n\nnext list is list1, first three are9,9,9 \u2192 reversed is9,9,9. So positions8-10:9,9,9.\n\nSo list0's output would start as [3,3,9,5,3,3,3,5,9,9,9].\n\nBut let's see if this matches any pattern from the training examples.\n\nExample2's output0's positions4-6 are the reversed first three of own list. For test list0, own first three are3,3,9 \u2192 reversed is9,3,3. So positions4-6 would be9,3,3. But according to the previous hypothesis, it's3,3,3. Which is it?\n\nThis is confusing. Let's try to find another angle.\n\nPerhaps each output list's replaced parts are formed by rotating the first three elements of the other lists. For example, list0's output uses list1's elements, list1's output uses list2's elements, list2's output uses list0's elements.\n\nFor Example0:\n\nlist0's output has 4,4,1 (list2's first three), and list2's output has1,1,2 (list0's first three).\n\nExample1's output list0 has6,6,6 (maybe list0's own first element), but the other parts.\n\nAlternatively, in each example, the output lists have their replaced sections filled with the first three elements of the other input lists, possibly in a certain order. \n\nFor the test input, the three input lists have first three elements:\n\nlist0:3,3,9\n\nlist1:9,9,9\n\nlist2:2,9,9\n\nIf the output for list0 uses list1's first three elements (9,9,9) for positions4-6 and list2's first three reversed (9,9,2) for positions8-10, then list0's output would be:\n\n[3,3,9,5,9,9,9,5,9,9,2]\n\nBut this is just a guess. Let's check if this fits any pattern from the training examples.\n\nIn Example0's output0, list2's first three (4,4,1) are used for positions4-6, and list1's first three reversed (4,1,1 \u2192 1,1,4) but output is1,4,4. Not matching.\n\nAlternatively, list0's output uses list2's first three reversed for positions4-6 and list1's first three reversed for positions8-10.\n\n list2's first three reversed:1,4,4 \u2192 positions4-6. But Example0's output0's positions4-6 are4,4,1, which is list2's first three. So perhaps not.\n\nAnother possible pattern: for each output list, positions4-6 are the third list's first three elements, and positions8-10 are the second list's first three elements reversed. For Example0's output0, this would be list2's first three (4,4,1) and list1's first three (4,1,1) reversed (1,1,4). But the output's positions8-10 are1,4,4. Not matching.\n\nI'm really stuck. Let's try to think of the test input and make a guess based on the examples.\n\nTest Input lists:\n\nlist0: [3,3,9,5,...]\n\nlist1: [9,9,9,5,...]\n\nlist2: [2,9,9,5,...]\n\nIf we follow the pattern from Example1's output0:\n\n- positions4-6 are the first element repeated thrice. So for list0:3,3,3.\n\n- positions8-10 are list2's first three reversed:2,9,9 \u2192 reversed is9,9,2. So positions8-10:9,9,2.\n\nSo list0's output would be [3,3,9,5,3,3,3,5,9,9,2].\n\nFor list1's output:\n\n- positions4-6: first element (9) repeated thrice \u21929,9,9.\n\n- positions8-10: list0's first three (3,3,9) reversed \u21929,3,3.\n\nSo list1's output: [9,9,9,5,9,9,9,5,9,3,3].\n\nFor list2's output:\n\n- positions4-6: first element (2) repeated thrice \u21922,2,2.\n\n- positions8-10: list1's first three (9,9,9) reversed \u21929,9,9.\n\nBut looking at the training examples, Example2's output lists have positions4-6 as the reversed first three of their own list. For example, list0's first three are2,7,8 \u2192 reversed8,7,2 in positions4-6. So perhaps for list2's output, positions4-6 are the reversed first three of list2's own input (2,9,9 \u2192 reversed9,9,2). Then positions8-10 are list0's first three reversed (3,3,9 \u21929,3,3).\n\nSo list2's output: [2,9,9,5,9,9,2,5,9,3,3].\n\nBut how does this fit with the training examples? In Example2's first output, positions4-6 are reversed own first three, and positions8-10 are next list's first three (list1's first three are7,7,8 \u2192 reversed8,7,7. But output is8,7,7 in positions8-10? No, Example2's first output's positions8-10 are8,8,8. Which is list2's own first three elements. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, the pattern is that each output list's positions4-6 are the reversed first three of the previous input list, and positions8-10 are the first three of the next input list. For example, in Example2's output list0:\n\nprevious list is list2 (8,8,8) \u2192 reversed is8,8,8. But positions4-6 are8,7,2 (reversed of list0's own first three). So this doesn't fit.\n\nI think I'm overcomplicating this. Let's look for the simplest pattern that fits all examples.\n\nIn all examples, the first four elements remain the same. Then, the next three elements (positions4-6) and positions8-10 are filled with certain values. Let's compare the outputs.\n\nExample0:\n\nInput lists:\n\n0: [1,1,2,5,...]\n\n1: [4,1,1,5,...]\n\n2: [4,4,1,5,...]\n\nOutput lists:\n\n0: [1,1,2,5,4,4,1,5,1,4,4]\n\n1: [4,1,1,5,4,1,1,5,1,1,4]\n\n2: [4,4,1,5,1,1,2,5,2,1,1]\n\nNotice that for output0, positions4-6 are list2's first three (4,4,1).\n\n positions8-10 are list1's first three (4,1,1) \u2192 1,4,4. Not sure.\n\nFor output1, positions4-6 are list0's first three (1,1,2) reversed (2,1,1) \u2192 no, output is4,1,1.\n\nAlternatively, output1's positions4-6 are list1's first three (4,1,1) \u2192 same as input.\n\n positions8-10 are list0's first three (1,1,2) \u2192 reversed is2,1,1. But output is1,1,4.\n\nThis doesn't fit.\n\nAnother idea: The replaced sections are filled with the first three elements of the other lists in a rotating manner. For example, in Example0's three output lists:\n\noutput0's 4-6 and8-10: list2's first three and list1's first three reversed.\n\noutput1's 4-6 and8-10: list0's first three and list2's first three reversed.\n\noutput2's 4-6 and8-10: list1's first three and list0's first three reversed.\n\nLet's check:\n\nExample0 output0:\n\n4-6: list2's first three (4,4,1) \u2192 correct.\n\n8-10: list1's first three (4,1,1) reversed \u21921,1,4. But output is1,4,4. Not matching.\n\nExample0 output1:\n\n4-6: list0's first three (1,1,2) \u2192 no, output is4,1,1.\n\nNot helpful.\n\nAlternatively, each replaced section is filled with the first three elements of the next list. For example, output0's 4-6: list1's first three, output0's8-10: list2's first three.\n\nExample0's output0:\n\n4-6: list1's first three (4,1,1) \u2192 output is4,4,1. No.\n\nThis approach is not working.\n\nFinal guess: For each output list, positions4-6 are the first three elements of the previous input list, and positions8-10 are the first three elements of the next input list, reversed. \n\nFor example, in Example0's output0:\n\nprevious list is list2 (4,4,1) \u2192 positions4-6:4,4,1.\n\n next list is list1 (4,1,1) \u2192 reversed is1,1,4 \u2192 positions8-10:1,4,4. Doesn't match.\n\nBut output's8-10 is1,4,4. Not matching reversed list1's first three.\n\nAlternatively, next list's first three elements are4,1,1. Maybe elements taken in reverse order but in a different way.\n\nAlternatively, take the next list's first three elements and rotate them.\n\nBut this is taking too long. I'll have to make an educated guess based on the examples, especially Example1 and Example2.\n\nIn Example2's output0, the first three elements of the input list are2,7,8. The replaced positions4-6 are8,7,2, which is the reverse. Then positions8-10 are8,8,8, which are the third input list's first three elements. \n\nIn Example1's output0, the replaced positions4-6 are6,6,6 (own first element repeated), and positions8-10 are2,3,6 (third input list's first three elements reversed).\n\nFor the test input:\n\nTest list0's first three are3,3,9. Reversed is9,3,3. So positions4-6:9,3,3.\n\n positions8-10: list2's first three reversed (2,9,9 \u21929,9,2). So positions8-10:9,9,2.\n\nThus, list0's output would be:\n\n[3,3,9,5,9,3,3,5,9,9,2]\n\nTest list1's first three are9,9,9. Reversed is9,9,9. So positions4-6:9,9,9.\n\n positions8-10: list0's first three reversed (3,3,9 \u21929,3,3). So list1's output:\n\n[9,9,9,5,9,9,9,5,9,3,3]\n\nTest list2's first three are2,9,9. Reversed is9,9,2. So positions4-6:9,9,2.\n\n positions8-10: list1's first three reversed (9,9,9 \u21929,9,9). So list2's output:\n\n[2,9,9,5,9,9,2,5,9,9,9]\n\nBut looking at Example2's output lists:\n\nThe third output list in Example2 is:\n\n[8,8,8,5,8,8,8,5,8,7,2]\n\nWhich has positions8-10 as8,7,2. That's the first input list's first three elements reversed (2,7,8 \u21928,7,2). So perhaps for list2's output, positions8-10 are the first input list's first three reversed.\n\nIn the test case, list2's output's positions8-10 would be list0's first three reversed (3,3,9 \u21929,3,3).\n\nBut earlier I thought list2's positions8-10 would be list1's first three reversed. So this is conflicting.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and the need to provide an answer, I'll proceed with the following pattern:\n\nFor each output list i:\n\n- The first four elements are unchanged.\n\n- Positions4-6 are the first three elements of the previous input list (i-1) in reverse order.\n\n- Positions8-10 are the first three elements of the next input list (i+1) in reverse order.\n\nApplying this to the test input:\n\nTest input lists:\n\n0: [3,3,9,5,0,0,0,5,0,0,0]\n\n1: [9,9,9,5,0,0,0,5,0,0,0]\n\n2: [2,9,9,5,0,0,0,5,0,0,0]\n\nOutput list0:\n\nprevious list is list2 (2,9,9) \u2192 reversed \u21929,9,2 \u2192 positions4-6:9,9,2.\n\n next list is list1 (9,9,9) \u2192 reversed \u21929,9,9 \u2192 positions8-10:9,9,9.\n\nSo output list0: [3,3,9,5,9,9,2,5,9,9,9]\n\nOutput list1:\n\nprevious list is list0 (3,3,9) \u2192 reversed \u21929,3,3 \u2192 positions4-6:9,3,3.\n\n next list is list2 (2,9,9) \u2192 reversed \u21929,9,2 \u2192 positions8-10:9,9,2.\n\nSo output list1: [9,9,9,5,9,3,3,5,9,9,2]\n\nOutput list2:\n\nprevious list is list1 (9,9,9) \u2192 reversed \u21929,9,9 \u2192 positions4-6:9,9,9.\n\n next list is list0 (3,3,9) \u2192 reversed \u21929,3,3 \u2192 positions8-10:9,3,3.\n\nSo output list2: [2,9,9,5,9,9,9,5,9,3,3]\n\nBut comparing to Example2's outputs, like the third output list:\n\n[8,8,8,5,8,8,8,5,8,7,2]\n\nHere, positions4-6 are8,8,8 (previous list's first three reversed?), previous list is list1 which has7,7,8. Reversed is8,7,7. Doesn't match. So this pattern doesn't hold for all examples. But given the time constraints, I'll proceed with this answer.",

        "cot_2": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. So, the input lists have numbers, and the output lists are transformations of those. Let's look at the training examples to see what's changing.\n\nStarting with Example 0. The input has three arrays. Each starts with some numbers, then 5, followed by three 0s, another 5, and three 0s. The outputs replace those zeros with other numbers. Let's take the first input array: [1,1,2,5,0,0,0,5,0,0,0]. The output is [1,1,2,5,4,4,1,5,1,4,4]. So the zeros after the first 5 are replaced by 4,4,1, and the zeros after the second 5 become 1,4,4. Hmm. Where do these numbers come from?\n\nLooking at the input arrays, maybe the numbers before the first 5 are being used somehow. In Example 0's first input array, the first three elements are 1,1,2. The replaced zeros after the first 5 are 4,4,1. Wait, how does 1,1,2 lead to 4,4,1? Not sure yet. Let's check other examples.\n\nIn Example 1, the first input array is [6,3,3,5,...]. The output after the first 5 is 6,6,6. The numbers before 5 are 6,3,3. Maybe the first number (6) is repeated three times here. Then after the second 5, the output is 2,3,6. That seems like a reverse of some sort. Like the original 6,3,3 reversed is 3,3,6, but here it's 2,3,6. Wait, where does the 2 come from? Maybe there's another pattern.\n\nLooking at the other lines in Example 0's output. The second input line is [4,1,1,5,0,0,0,5,0,0,0], and output is [4,1,1,5,4,1,1,5,1,1,4]. The zeros after the first 5 become 4,1,1. The input's first three numbers are 4,1,1. So 4,1,1 is replicated here. Then after the second 5, it's 1,1,4. Which is the reverse of 4,1,1. Oh, wait! So maybe the first set of zeros after the first 5 are filled with the first three elements of the input array, but in some transformed way, and the second set after the second 5 are a reversed version or a rotated version?\n\nWait, in Example 0's first input: the first three are 1,1,2. The first set of zeros become 4,4,1. That's not the same as the first three. So maybe it's looking at a different part. Let me check the other examples again.\n\nTake Example 2's first input: [2,7,8,5,...]. Output after first 5 is 8,7,2. That's the reverse of the first three numbers (2,7,8 reversed is 8,7,2). Then after the second 5, the output is 8,8,8. Hmm, the first three numbers here are 2,7,8. The reversed gives 8,7,2 for the first part. Then the second part is all 8s, which is the first number of the reversed array? Or maybe the maximum value?\n\nWait, 8 is the maximum of 2,7,8. But in Example 0's first input, the first three numbers are 1,1,2. Max is 2. But the first part of the output after the first 5 is 4,4,1. Hmm, maybe not max. Let's look for another pattern.\n\nLooking at the structure of the outputs. Each input line has three parts: the initial numbers up to the first 5, then three zeros, another 5, then three zeros. The output replaces the zeros with other numbers. So for each input line, the output modifies those zeros in some way based on the initial numbers.\n\nAnother approach: Let's check if the output segments correspond to other lines in the input. For example, in Example 0, the first input line's output after the first 5 is 4,4,1. The second input line starts with 4,1,1. Maybe the output takes elements from other lines. Wait, the outputs are three lines each. So perhaps each output line is derived from all three input lines?\n\nWait, looking at the first example's input:\n\nInput lines for Example 0:\n[1,1,2,5,0,0,0,5,0,0,0]\n[4,1,1,5,0,0,0,5,0,0,0]\n[4,4,1,5,0,0,0,5,0,0,0]\n\nAnd outputs:\n[1,1,2,5,4,4,1,5,1,4,4]\n[4,1,1,5,4,1,1,5,1,1,4]\n[4,4,1,5,1,1,2,5,2,1,1]\n\nNotice that in the first output line, the first part is 1,1,2 (same as input), then after the first 5, it's 4,4,1. The second input line starts with 4,1,1. The third input line starts with 4,4,1. So maybe the first output's first segment after the first 5 is taken from the next input lines. For example, the first output's first three elements after 5 are 4,4,1, which is the third input line's first three elements. Then the second output line's first three after 5 are 4,1,1, which is the second input line's first three. The third output line's first three after 5 are 1,1,2, which is the first input line's first three.\n\nThen for the second part after the second 5, the first output line has 1,4,4. Which could be the second input line's first three elements reversed (1,1,4 reversed is 4,1,1?), but not exactly. Alternatively, maybe it's combining elements from the other lines. Let's see:\n\nLooking at the second part of the first output line in Example 0: after the second 5, it's 1,4,4. The second input line's first three are 4,1,1. Maybe it's reversed to 1,1,4 and then take the first three? But 1,4,4 doesn't match. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each output line's first segment after the first 5 is taken from the next input line's first three elements, and the segment after the second 5 is taken from the previous input lines. For example, in Example 0:\n\nFirst output line's first segment after first 5: 4,4,1. That's the third input line's first three (4,4,1). Then the second segment after 5: 1,4,4. Which could be the second input line's first three (4,1,1) reversed, but 1,1,4 reversed is 4,1,1. Not matching. Alternatively, perhaps the segments are rotated. Let's see:\n\nIf the first input line's first three are 1,1,2. The second input line's are 4,1,1. The third's are 4,4,1.\n\nThen the first output's first segment after 5 is 4,4,1 (third line). The second output's first segment is 4,1,1 (second line). The third output's first segment is 1,1,2 (first line). So it's cycling through the input lines. So each output line's first segment after the first 5 is the next input line's first three elements.\n\nSimilarly, the second segment after the second 5: for the first output line, it's 1,4,4. The third input line's first three are 4,4,1. Reversed would be 1,4,4. Ah! So maybe after the second 5, the segment is the reverse of the next input line's first three elements. Let's check:\n\nIn Example 0:\n\nFirst output line's second segment: 1,4,4. Third input line's first three:4,4,1. Reverse gives 1,4,4. Yes. That matches.\n\nSecond output line's second segment:1,1,4. Second input line's first three:4,1,1 reversed is 1,1,4. Yes.\n\nThird output line's second segment:2,1,1. First input line's first three:1,1,2 reversed is 2,1,1. Yes.\n\nThat seems to fit! So the pattern could be:\n\nFor each output line i:\n\n- The first three elements are the same as input line i's first three.\n\n- The elements after the first 5 (positions 4,5,6) are the first three elements of the next input line (with wrap-around if necessary). So for the third line, next line is the first line.\n\n- The elements after the second 5 (positions 8,9,10) are the reverse of the first three elements of the previous input line. For the first line, previous is the third line.\n\nLet me check Example 1 to see if this holds.\n\nExample 1's input:\n\nInput lines:\n\n[6,3,3,5,0,0,0,5,0,0,0]\n[6,3,3,5,0,0,0,5,0,0,0]\n[6,3,2,5,0,0,0,5,0,0,0]\n\nOutput lines:\n\nFirst output line: [6,3,3,5,6,6,6,5,2,3,6]\n\nSecond output line: [6,3,3,5,3,3,3,5,3,3,6]\n\nThird output line: [6,3,2,5,2,3,3,5,3,3,6]\n\nAccording to the pattern:\n\nFirst output line (i=0):\n\n- First three:6,3,3 (matches input line 0)\n\n- After first 5: next input line (line 1) first three:6,3,3. So the segment should be [6,3,3], but in the output it's [6,6,6]. Hmm, that's not matching. So maybe my initial hypothesis is wrong.\n\nWait, the first output line's first segment after the first 5 is 6,6,6. The next input line (line 1) is [6,3,3,5,...]. So first three are 6,3,3. But output here is 6,6,6. That doesn't fit. So maybe there's a different pattern.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's taking the first element of the next input line and repeating it three times. For the first output line in Example 1:\n\nNext input line (line 1) first element is 6. So 6,6,6. That matches. The second output line's next input line is line 2, which starts with 6,3,2. So first element is 6. But the segment after 5 in the second output line is 3,3,3. Wait, that doesn't fit. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's the first element of the current line's next line. Let me think again. For the first output line in Example 1:\n\nThe first segment after 5 is 6,6,6. The next input line (line 1) starts with 6,3,3. Maybe taking the first element (6) and repeating it three times. So 6,6,6. Then the second segment after the second 5 is the reverse of the previous input line's first three elements. The previous line for line 0 is line 2 (since there are three lines). Line 2's first three are 6,3,2. Reverse is 2,3,6. Which matches the second segment of the first output line (2,3,6).\n\nThen the second output line (i=1) in Example 1:\n\nAfter first 5: next input line is line 2, which starts with 6,3,2. Taking first element 6? But output here is 3,3,3. Wait, that doesn't fit. Or maybe the next input line's first three elements are summed or some other operation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the first segment after the first 5 is the next line's first element repeated three times, and the second segment is the previous line's first element followed by other elements.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Let me try another approach. Let's look at the outputs and see how they relate to the inputs across the examples.\n\nTake Example 0's first output line:\n\nAfter first 5: 4,4,1. The third input line's first three elements are 4,4,1. So perhaps, the first segment after 5 in the output line i is the input line (i+1) mod 3's first three elements. Then the second segment after the second 5 is the input line (i-1) mod 3's first three elements reversed.\n\nTesting this for Example 0:\n\ni=0:\n\nFirst segment after 5: input line (0+1)=1's first three elements: [4,1,1]. But output is [4,4,1]. No, that's input line 2's first three elements. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe output line i's first segment is input line (i+1)'s first three elements. For Example 0's first output line (i=0), input line 1 has [4,1,1]. But the output after first 5 is [4,4,1]. Which is input line 2's first three. So that doesn't fit. But in Example 0's third output line (i=2), after first 5 is [1,1,2], which is input line 0's first three. So for output line i, maybe it's input line (i+1)'s first three elements.\n\nBut in Example 0's first output line, input line i+1 is 1 (0+1=1). Input line 1's first three are 4,1,1. But the output here is 4,4,1, which is input line 2's first three. So that doesn't fit. So perhaps the pattern isn't that straightforward.\n\nAnother idea: Maybe each output line's first three elements are same as input line's, and the zeros after first 5 are filled with the next line's elements (but not sure how), and after the second 5, filled with previous line's elements reversed.\n\nLooking at Example 1's first output line:\n\nAfter first 5:6,6,6. The next input line (line 1) has first three elements 6,3,3. How does 6,6,6 come from that? Maybe take the first element (6) and repeat it. Then after second 5:2,3,6. Previous line's (line 2) first three elements are 6,3,2. Reverse is 2,3,6. Which matches.\n\nSecond output line in Example1: after first 5 is 3,3,3. Next line is line 2, which starts with 6,3,2. So if we take the first element (6), but output is 3,3,3. Wait, that's not matching. Alternatively, maybe the middle element of the next line's first three. Line 2's first three are 6,3,2. Middle is 3. So 3,3,3. Which matches. Then after the second 5: previous line is line 1, which starts with 6,3,3. Reversed is 3,3,6. The output here is 3,3,6. Which matches.\n\nThird output line in Example1: after first 5:2,3,3. Next line is line 0 (since i=2, next is (2+1) mod3=0. Line 0 starts with6,3,3. Middle element is3. So 3,3,3. But output here is 2,3,3. Wait, not matching. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for the first segment after 5, it's the next line's second element. Let's check:\n\nIn Example1, third output line's after first 5:2,3,3. Next line is line0, which has first three elements6,3,3. Second element is3. But output starts with 2. So that's not it.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's the next line's third element. Third element is3. So 3,3,3. But output is2,3,3. Doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. Let's try to see another pattern.\n\nLooking at Example 0's outputs:\n\nFirst output line after first 5:4,4,1. Which is the third input line's first three. Second output line after first 5:4,1,1 (second input line's first three). Third output line after first 5:1,1,2 (first input line's first three). So it's like each output line takes the first three elements of the next input line (in a circular manner). Then, after the second 5, they take the reverse of the previous input line's first three elements.\n\nLet's test this:\n\nFor Example 0's first output line (i=0):\n\nAfter first 5: next input line (i=1) is [4,1,1,5,...], so first three elements 4,1,1. But output here is4,4,1. Doesn't match. So that's not correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output after first 5 is the next input line's first three elements, but with some transformation. For example, sorted or reversed.\n\nIn Example0's first output line, after first 5 is4,4,1. Next input line is line1:4,1,1. Reversed would be1,1,4. Not matching. Sorted ascending would be1,1,4. Not matching. So that's not it.\n\nAnother idea: The first segment after 5 in the output is the next input line's first three elements summed or multiplied in some way. But I don't see a direct numeric pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the first segment after 5 is a combination of elements from the current and other lines.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the entire input set, perhaps each output line's segments after the 5s are derived from other lines in the input. For example, the first segment after first 5 in output line i is the first three elements of input line (i+1) mod3, and the second segment after the second 5 is the first three elements of input line (i-1) mod3 reversed.\n\nTesting this:\n\nExample0, output line0:\n\ni=0, next line is (0+1)=1: input line1's first three are4,1,1. So first segment would be4,1,1. But output is4,4,1. Doesn't match. Previous line is (0-1)=2 mod3=2. Input line2's first three are4,4,1. Reverse is1,4,4. Which matches the second segment (1,4,4).\n\nBut the first segment doesn't fit.\n\nWait, but in Example0's output line0, after first5 is4,4,1. Which is input line2's first three elements. So maybe it's input line (i+2) mod3?\n\nFor i=0, (0+2)=2 mod3. Input line2's first three are4,4,1. Which matches the first segment.\n\nThen the second segment is input line (i-1) mod3. i=0-1=2 mod3. Input line2's first three reversed is1,4,4. Which matches.\n\nSimilarly for output line1 (i=1):\n\nFirst segment would be (i+2)=3 mod3=0. Input line0's first three are1,1,2. But output after first5 is4,1,1. Which is input line1's first three. Hmm, no.\n\nAlternatively, maybe first segment is input line (i+1) mod3's first three reversed.\n\nFor i=0, input line1's first three reversed is1,1,4. Output after first5 is4,4,1. Doesn't match.\n\nThis is getting confusing. Let me try to see if there's another pattern.\n\nLooking at Example1's first output line:\n\nAfter first5:6,6,6. Input line1's first three are6,3,3. Maybe taking the first element (6) and repeating it. Then after second5: input line2's first three reversed (6,3,2 reversed is2,3,6). Which matches.\n\nSecond output line (i=1) after first5:3,3,3. Input line2's first element is6. No. Wait, but maybe this is taking the middle element of the next line's first three. Next line for i=1 is line2, first three are6,3,2. Middle is3. So 3,3,3. Which matches.\n\nAfter second5: previous line is line0's first three reversed (6,3,3 reversed is3,3,6). The output is3,3,6. Which matches.\n\nThird output line (i=2) after first5:2,3,3. Next line is line0, first three are6,3,3. Middle element is3. So 3,3,3. But output is2,3,3. Doesn't match. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe for the first segment after5, it's the middle element of the next line's first three, repeated three times. For Example1, line0:\n\nNext line is line1, first three are6,3,3. Middle is3. So 3,3,3. But output is6,6,6. Doesn't fit. So that's not it.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the sum of the next line's first three elements. 6+3+3=12. But output is6,6,6. Maybe 12 divided by 2? 6. So 6,6,6. That could be a stretch. For the second output line in Example1, next line is line2's first three:6+3+2=11. 11/ something? Doesn't fit 3,3,3. So perhaps not.\n\nAnother angle: Looking at the first and third examples, the output after first5 sometimes mirrors the input lines' first three elements.\n\nIn Example2's first output line:\n\nInput lines:\n\nLine0: [2,7,8,5,...]\n\nOutput line0 after first5:8,7,2. Which is the reverse of line0's first three elements. Then after second5:8,8,8. Which is the maximum of the first three (8) repeated.\n\nWait, line0's first three elements are2,7,8. Max is8. So after the second5, it's three 8s. That fits.\n\nThen for Example2's second output line:\n\nInput line1:7,7,8,5...\n\nOutput after first5:8,7,7. Which is reverse of 7,7,8 \u21928,7,7. Then after second5:8,7,7. Wait, no. Output is8,7,7 after second5. But in the example, the output after second5 is8,7,7. Wait, but according to the previous pattern, after second5 would be the max of the first three. 7,7,8: max is8. So three 8s. But the actual output here is8,7,7. So that contradicts.\n\nHmm, but in Example2's first output line:\n\nAfter first5:8,7,2 (reverse of input's first three). After second5:8,8,8 (max).\n\nSecond output line:\n\nAfter first5:8,7,7 (reverse of input line1's first three7,7,8). Then after second5:8,7,7. But according to max idea, it should be8. But output is8,7,7.\n\nSo maybe after the first5 is reverse, and after the second5 is the max repeated. But in the first case, after second5 it's max. In the second case, it's not. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe after first5 is reverse, after second5 is the same as the reverse of another part. Not sure.\n\nLet's look at Example2's third output line:\n\nInput line2:8,8,8,5...\n\nOutput after first5:8,8,8 (reverse of input line2's first three is same). After second5:8,7,2. Which is the reverse of input line0's first three elements2,7,8 \u21928,7,2. So perhaps after second5, it's the reverse of the first input line's first three.\n\nBut how does that generalize?\n\nIn Example0's first output line:\n\nAfter second5:1,4,4. Which is reverse of input line2's first three elements4,4,1 \u21921,4,4.\n\nExample0's second output line:\n\nAfter second5:1,1,4. Which is reverse of input line0's first three elements1,1,2 \u21922,1,1. No. Wait, but the second output line's after second5 is1,1,4. Input line1's first three are4,1,1. Reverse is1,1,4. Yes. So for output linei, after second5 is reverse of input linei's previous line's first three elements.\n\nBut how is previous determined? In Example0:\n\nOutput line0's after second5 is reverse of input line2's first three (since i=0, previous is line2).\n\nOutput line1's after second5 is reverse of input line0's first three (1,1,2 reversed is 2,1,1). But in Example0's second output line, after second5 is1,1,4. Which is reverse of input line1's first three (4,1,1 \u21921,1,4). So maybe after second5 for linei is reverse of input linei-1's first three elements.\n\nYes, that seems to fit.\n\nFor Example0:\n\ni=0 \u2192 linei-1 = line2 (since i-1= -1 \u21922 mod3). Reverse of line2's first three (4,4,1 \u21921,4,4).\n\ni=1 \u2192 line0's first three (1,1,2 reversed \u21922,1,1). But output is1,1,4. So that doesn't fit. Hmm.\n\nWait, in Example0's second output line (i=1), after second5 is1,1,4. Which is reverse of line1's first three (4,1,1 \u21921,1,4). So perhaps after second5 for linei is reverse of linei's first three elements.\n\nBut no, for Example0's first output line (i=0), after second5 is1,4,4. Reverse of line0's first three (1,1,2 reversed is2,1,1). Doesn't match.\n\nAlternatively, maybe after first5 is the reverse of the next line's first three elements, and after second5 is the reverse of the previous line's first three elements.\n\nFor Example0's first output line (i=0):\n\nAfter first5: next line (i+1=1) first three elements4,1,1 \u2192 reversed is1,1,4. But output is4,4,1. Doesn't match.\n\nThis is getting too tangled. Let me try to see if there's a different approach.\n\nAnother observation: The outputs have the same 5s in the same positions as the inputs, replacing the zeros. So the structure is preserved except for the zeros.\n\nLooking at the positions:\n\nFor each input line, positions 0-3 are the initial numbers (three elements, then 5). Positions4-6 are zeros, then 5 at position7, positions8-10 are zeros.\n\nIn the outputs, positions4-6 and8-10 are filled.\n\nLet's see if there's a relation between the filled numbers and other parts of the input lines.\n\nExample0's first output line:\n\nInput line0: [1,1,2,5,0,0,0,5,0,0,0]\n\nOutput line0: [1,1,2,5,4,4,1,5,1,4,4]\n\nThe filled segments are positions4-6:4,4,1 and8-10:1,4,4.\n\nLooking at other input lines:\n\nInput line1 starts with4,1,1. Input line2 starts with4,4,1.\n\nSo the filled segments in output line0's first part (4,4,1) match input line2's first three. The second filled segment (1,4,4) matches the reverse of input line2's first three (4,4,1 reversed is1,4,4).\n\nSo output line0's first filled part is input line2's first three, and the second filled part is reversed input line2's first three.\n\nIn Example0's second output line:\n\nOutput line1: [4,1,1,5,4,1,1,5,1,1,4]\n\nFilled parts:4,1,1 and1,1,4. Input line1's first three are4,1,1. So first filled part is same as input line1's first three. Second filled part is reverse of input line1's first three (1,1,4).\n\nThird output line:\n\nOutput line2: [4,4,1,5,1,1,2,5,2,1,1]\n\nFilled parts:1,1,2 and2,1,1. Input line0's first three are1,1,2. So first filled part is input line0's first three. Second filled part is reversed (2,1,1).\n\nSo the pattern seems to be:\n\nFor each output linei:\n\n- The first filled segment (positions4-6) is the input line (i+1) mod3's first three elements.\n\n- The second filled segment (positions8-10) is the input line (i-1) mod3's first three elements reversed.\n\nTesting this:\n\nExample0:\n\ni=0:\n\n+1 mod3=1 \u2192 input line1's first three:4,1,1. But output line0's first filled is4,4,1. Doesn't match.\n\nWait, no. Wait output line0's first filled is4,4,1 which is input line2's first three. So this doesn't fit. But according to the previous observation, the first filled part for output line0 is input line2's first three. Which is i+2 mod3. So i+2 mod3 for i=0 is 2.\n\nThen, the pattern could be:\n\n- First filled segment: input line (i+2) mod3's first three elements.\n\n- Second filled segment: input line (i-1) mod3's first three elements reversed.\n\nLet's check:\n\nExample0's output line0:\n\ni=0. (0+2) mod3=2 \u2192 input line2's first three:4,4,1. Filled first part is4,4,1. Correct.\n\n(i-1) mod3=2 \u2192 input line2's first three reversed:1,4,4. Which matches the second filled part1,4,4. Correct.\n\nExample0's output line1 (i=1):\n\n(i+2)=3 mod3=0 \u2192 input line0's first three:1,1,2. Filled first part is4,1,1. No. Doesn't match.\n\nBut according to the previous example, output line1's first filled is4,1,1, which is input line1's first three. So this pattern doesn't hold.\n\nAlternative approach: Looking at all examples, perhaps each output line's filled segments are taken from other lines' first three elements in a rotating manner.\n\nIn Example0's three output lines:\n\nOutput line0's filled after first5:4,4,1 (line2's first three)\n\nAfter second5:1,4,4 (reverse of line2's first three)\n\nOutput line1's filled after first5:4,1,1 (line1's first three)\n\nAfter second5:1,1,4 (reverse of line1's first three)\n\nOutput line2's filled after first5:1,1,2 (line0's first three)\n\nAfter second5:2,1,1 (reverse of line0's first three)\n\nSo it seems that for each output linei:\n\n- The first filled segment is line (i+2) mod3's first three elements.\n\n- The second filled segment is line (i) mod3's first three elements reversed.\n\nWait, in output line0:\n\ni=0. (0+2)=2 \u2192 line2's first three. Second segment is line0's first three reversed (1,1,2 \u21922,1,1). But output line0's second segment is1,4,4. Doesn't fit.\n\nHmm, no. This is getting too complicated. Maybe the pattern is that for each output line, the first filled segment is the next line's first three elements, and the second filled segment is the previous line's first three elements reversed. With the lines arranged in a circular manner.\n\nExample0's output line0:\n\nNext line is line1. first three elements4,1,1. But output is4,4,1. No. Previous line is line2. first three elements4,4,1 reversed is1,4,4. Which matches the second filled segment. So first filled segment is line2's first three, second is line2's reversed. \n\nExample0's output line1:\n\nNext line is line2's first three4,4,1. But output's first filled is4,1,1 (line1's own first three). Previous line is line0's first three reversed2,1,1. But output's second filled is1,1,4. Which is line1's first three reversed.\n\nSo maybe each output line's first filled is their own first three, and second filled is their own first three reversed. But in example0's output line0, the first filled is not their own first three.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each output line's first filled is the previous line's first three, and second filled is next line's first three reversed.\n\nIn example0's line0:\n\nPrevious line is line2's first three4,4,1. So first filled is4,4,1. Second filled is next line (line1's first three4,1,1 reversed1,1,4). Which matches.\n\nExample0's line1:\n\nPrevious line is line0's first three1,1,2. First filled is1,1,2. But output's first filled is4,1,1. No.\n\nHmm, that's not right.\n\nAnother observation: Looking at the test input, perhaps we can try applying the pattern observed in the examples.\n\nTest Input:\n\n[3,3,9,5,0,0,0,5,0,0,0]\n\n[9,9,9,5,0,0,0,5,0,0,0]\n\n[2,9,9,5,0,0,0,5,0,0,0]\n\nAssuming that for each output linei:\n\n- After first5: filled with line (i+2) mod3's first three elements.\n\n- After second5: filled with line (i-1) mod3's first three elements reversed.\n\nLet's compute for each line.\n\nTest line0 (i=0):\n\nFirst filled: (0+2) mod3=2 \u2192 line2's first three:2,9,9 \u2192 filled as2,9,9.\n\nSecond filled: (0-1) mod3=2 \u2192 line2's first three reversed:9,9,2.\n\nSo output line0: [3,3,9,5,2,9,9,5,9,9,2]\n\nTest line1 (i=1):\n\nFirst filled: (1+2)=3 mod3=0 \u2192 line0's first three:3,3,9 \u2192 filled as3,3,9.\n\nSecond filled: (1-1)=0 \u2192 line0's first three reversed:9,3,3.\n\nSo output line1: [9,9,9,5,3,3,9,5,9,3,3]\n\nTest line2 (i=2):\n\nFirst filled: (2+2)=4 mod3=1 \u2192 line1's first three:9,9,9.\n\nSecond filled: (2-1)=1 \u2192 line1's first three reversed:9,9,9.\n\nSo output line2: [2,9,9,5,9,9,9,5,9,9,9]\n\nBut let's check if this pattern matches the training examples.\n\nLooking at Example0:\n\ni=0:\n\nFirst filled: line2's first three4,4,1 \u2192 output is4,4,1.\n\nSecond filled: line2's first three reversed \u21921,4,4.\n\nWhich matches.\n\ni=1:\n\nFirst filled: (1+2)=3 mod3=0 \u2192 line0's first three1,1,2. Output's first filled is4,1,1. Doesn't match.\n\nSo this pattern doesn't hold for Example0.\n\nTherefore, this approach is incorrect.\n\nAlternative approach: Let's look for a pattern where each filled segment is derived from the other input lines in a certain way. For example, the first filled segment after first5 in output linei is the first three elements of input line (i+1) mod3, and the second filled segment is the first three elements of input line (i-1) mod3 reversed.\n\nTesting this:\n\nExample0's output line0:\n\n(i+1)=1 mod3. Input line1's first three4,1,1. So filled after first5:4,1,1. But output is4,4,1. No.\n\nExample1's output line0:\n\n(i+1)=1. Input line1's first three6,3,3. Output after first5:6,6,6. Doesn't match.\n\nSo this doesn't work.\n\nAnother idea: The first filled segment after first5 in output linei is the sum of the first three elements of input linei and the next line's first three elements. But this seems unlikely given the numbers.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each output line's filled segments are formed by rotating the elements of the input lines. For example, in Example0's first output line:\n\nAfter first5:4,4,1. Which is input line2's first three.\n\nAfter second5:1,4,4. Which is the reverse of input line2's first three.\n\nSo for output linei, first filled is input line (i+2) mod3's first three, and second filled is reverse of the same line.\n\nBut for Example0's line0:\n\nYes, input line2's first three is4,4,1. Filled after first5:4,4,1. Filled after second5:1,4,4.\n\nExample0's line1:\n\nInput line (1+2)=3 mod3=0's first three1,1,2. Filled after first5:4,1,1. Doesn't match.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each output line's filled segments are the previous and next line's first three elements. For example:\n\nExample0's line0:\n\nAfter first5: input line2's first three.\n\nAfter second5: input line2's first three reversed.\n\nExample0's line1:\n\nAfter first5: input line1's own first three.\n\nAfter second5: input line1's own first three reversed.\n\nExample0's line2:\n\nAfter first5: input line0's first three.\n\nAfter second5: input line0's first three reversed.\n\nThis seems to fit for Example0:\n\nline0:4,4,1 and 1,4,4 \u2192 line2's first three and reversed.\n\nline1:4,1,1 and 1,1,4 \u2192 line1's own and reversed.\n\nline2:1,1,2 and 2,1,1 \u2192 line0's and reversed.\n\nThis pattern holds for Example0.\n\nCheck Example1:\n\nExample1's output line0:\n\nAfter first5:6,6,6. Input line0's first three are6,3,3. Reversed is3,3,6. No.\n\nWait, no. According to the pattern, line0 would take line2's first three. Let's see.\n\nExample1's input lines:\n\nline0:6,3,3,5...\n\nline1:6,3,3,5...\n\nline2:6,3,2,5...\n\nSo output line0 would take line2's first three6,3,2. Then reverse for second filled:2,3,6.\n\nWhich matches the output line0's filled segments:6,6,6 and2,3,6. Wait, no. The first filled is6,6,6, which is not line2's first three6,3,2. So this pattern doesn't fit.\n\nExample1's output line0:\n\nAfter first5:6,6,6. If line0's filled first is line2's first three6,3,2, but output is6,6,6. Doesn't match.\n\nAnother angle: Perhaps the first filled segment after first5 is the sum of the corresponding positions in the other two lines. For example:\n\nIn Example0's line0:\n\nFirst filled after5 is4,4,1. The other two input lines' first three elements are line1:4,1,1 and line2:4,4,1. So perhaps taking the sum for each position:\n\n4 (from line1) +4 (line2) =8? Not sure. Or maybe taking the maximum. For position4:\n\nline1[0]=4, line2[0]=4 \u2192 max is4. Position4:4.\n\nPosition5: line1[1]=1, line2[1]=4 \u2192 max4. So 4.\n\nPosition6: line1[2]=1, line2[2]=1 \u21921.\n\nSo filled is4,4,1. Which matches. That's possible.\n\nThen for the second filled segment after5, maybe the sum or max of previous lines.\n\nFor Example0's line0's second filled segment:1,4,4.\n\nPrevious lines are line1 and line2. Let's take line2's first three4,4,1. Reverse gives1,4,4. Which matches.\n\nSo the pattern could be:\n\nFor output linei:\n\n- After first5: take the maximum of the corresponding positions in the other two input lines' first three elements.\n\n- After second5: take the reverse of one of the input lines' first three.\n\nBut how to determine which line to take.\n\nIn Example0's line0:\n\nOther two lines are line1 and line2. Max of each position:\n\nline1's first three:4,1,1.\n\nline2's first three:4,4,1.\n\nMax for each position:\n\n4,4,1 \u2192 which matches the first filled segment.\n\nThen reverse of line2's first three:1,4,4.\n\nThis fits.\n\nFor Example0's line1:\n\nOther two lines are line0 and line2.\n\nline0:1,1,2.\n\nline2:4,4,1.\n\nMax of each position:4,4,2.\n\nBut the filled segment is4,1,1. Doesn't match. So this pattern doesn't hold.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for output linei, after first5 is the first three elements of linei+1, and after second5 is the reversed first three of linei-1.\n\nExample0's line0:\n\ni+1=1's first three4,1,1 \u2192 filled after first5:4,4,1. No.\n\nBut linei+2=2's first three4,4,1. Filled after first5:4,4,1. Yes.\n\nThen after second5 is linei-1=2's first three reversed. Which is1,4,4. Yes.\n\nExample0's line1:\n\ni+2=3 mod3=0's first three1,1,2. Filled after first5:4,1,1. No.\n\nThis doesn't fit.\n\nAlternative conclusion: After hours of analysis, the pattern seems to be that for each output linei:\n\n- The first filled segment (positions4-6) is the first three elements of the next input line in the list (with wrap-around if necessary), and the second filled segment (positions8-10) is the reverse of the first three elements of the previous input line in the list (again with wrap-around).\n\nSo for three input lines, the next line after line2 is line0.\n\nExample0:\n\nOutput line0's first filled is next line1's first three:4,1,1. But output is4,4,1. Doesn't fit.\n\nBut Example0's output line0's first filled is4,4,1, which is line2's first three. Previous line for line0 is line2.\n\nSo perhaps:\n\nFirst filled segment is previous line's first three.\n\nSecond filled segment is previous line's first three reversed.\n\nFor line0:\n\nPrevious line is line2. First three:4,4,1.\n\nSo first filled:4,4,1.\n\nSecond filled:1,4,4.\n\nWhich matches.\n\nFor line1:\n\nPrevious line is line0. First three:1,1,2.\n\nFirst filled:1,1,2.\n\nBut output line1's first filled is4,1,1. Doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. This is frustrating. Maybe there's a different pattern.\n\nLet's look at the Test Input and try to predict based on possible patterns.\n\nTest Input:\n\nLines:\n\n0: [3,3,9,5,0,0,0,5,0,0,0]\n\n1: [9,9,9,5,0,0,0,5,0,0,0]\n\n2: [2,9,9,5,0,0,0,5,0,0,0]\n\nAssuming that for each output linei:\n\n- The first filled segment after first5 is the next line's first three elements.\n\n- The second filled segment after second5 is the previous line's first three reversed.\n\nWith line order being circular.\n\nSo:\n\nOutput line0:\n\nNext line is line1's first three:9,9,9 \u2192 filled after first5:9,9,9.\n\nPrevious line is line2's first three:2,9,9 \u2192 reversed:9,9,2 \u2192 filled after second5.\n\nSo output line0: [3,3,9,5,9,9,9,5,9,9,2]\n\nOutput line1:\n\nNext line is line2's first three:2,9,9 \u2192 filled after first5.\n\nPrevious line is line0's first three:3,3,9 \u2192 reversed:9,3,3 \u2192 filled after second5.\n\nSo output line1: [9,9,9,5,2,9,9,5,9,3,3]\n\nOutput line2:\n\nNext line is line0's first three:3,3,9 \u2192 filled after first5.\n\nPrevious line is line1's first three:9,9,9 \u2192 reversed:9,9,9 \u2192 filled after second5.\n\nSo output line2: [2,9,9,5,3,3,9,5,9,9,9]\n\nBut looking at the training examples, this doesn't quite fit. For example, Example0's output line0's first filled is4,4,1, which is line2's first three (previous line), not next line. So perhaps the pattern is previous line's first three for first filled, and previous line's reversed for second filled.\n\nIn that case:\n\nTest line0:\n\nPrevious line is line2's first three:2,9,9 \u2192 filled after first5.\n\nReversed:9,9,2 \u2192 filled after second5.\n\nOutput line0: [3,3,9,5,2,9,9,5,9,9,2]\n\nBut Example0's line0 first filled was previous line's first three (line2's 4,4,1). Which matches.\n\nExample0's line0's second filled was reversed line2's first three (1,4,4).\n\nYes. So this pattern holds.\n\nThen, applying this to the test input:\n\nOutput line0:\n\n[3,3,9,5,2,9,9,5,9,9,2]\n\nOutput line1:\n\nPrevious line is line0's first three3,3,9 \u2192 filled after first5:3,3,9.\n\nReversed:9,3,3 \u2192 filled after second5.\n\nSo line1's output: [9,9,9,5,3,3,9,5,9,3,3]\n\nOutput line2:\n\nPrevious line is line1's first three9,9,9 \u2192 filled after first5.\n\nReversed:9,9,9 \u2192 filled after second5.\n\nSo line2's output: [2,9,9,5,9,9,9,5,9,9,9]\n\nComparing this with the training examples, in Example0's line1, the previous line is line0's first three1,1,2. So first filled is1,1,2. Output line1's filled after first5 is4,1,1. Doesn't match. So this pattern doesn't hold for Example0's line1.\n\nThus, this approach is incorrect.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and the lack of progress, I think the pattern must be that for each output linei:\n\n- The first filled segment (positions4-6) is the previous line's first three elements.\n\n- The second filled segment (positions8-10) is the previous line's first three elements reversed.\n\nWhere previous line is (i-1) mod3.\n\nBut in Example0's line0, previous line is line2. So first filled is line2's first three4,4,1. Second filled is1,4,4. Which matches.\n\nLine1's previous line is line0's first three1,1,2. So filled after first5:1,1,2. But output is4,1,1. Doesn't fit.\n\nThis is not working.\n\nFinal attempt: Looking at the examples, perhaps the first filled segment after first5 is the next line's first three elements in reverse order, and the second filled segment is the previous line's first three elements in reverse.\n\nExample0's line0:\n\nNext line is line1's first three4,1,1 \u2192 reversed1,1,4. But output after first5 is4,4,1. Doesn't match.\n\nAlternative, the first filled is the next line's first three elements reversed, and the second filled is the previous line's first three elements.\n\nExample0 line0:\n\nNext line is line1:4,1,1 reversed1,1,4. But output after first5 is4,4,1. Doesn't fit.\n\nAt this point, given the time I've spent, I'll have to make an educated guess based on the test input and the examples. The test input lines are:\n\nLine0:3,3,9,5...\n\nLine1:9,9,9,5...\n\nLine2:2,9,9,5...\n\nAssuming that the first filled segment for each output line is the previous line's first three reversed, and the second filled is the next line's first three reversed.\n\nFor Test line0:\n\nPrevious line is line2's first three2,9,9 reversed9,9,2. After first5:9,9,2.\n\nNext line is line1's first three9,9,9 reversed9,9,9. After second5:9,9,9.\n\nSo line0's output: [3,3,9,5,9,9,2,5,9,9,9]\n\nLine1:\n\nPrevious line is line0's first three3,3,9 reversed9,3,3. After first5:9,3,3.\n\nNext line is line2's first three2,9,9 reversed9,9,2. After second5:9,9,2.\n\nSo line1's output: [9,9,9,5,9,3,3,5,9,9,2]\n\nLine2:\n\nPrevious line is line1's first three9,9,9 reversed9,9,9. After first5:9,9,9.\n\nNext line is line0's first three3,3,9 reversed9,3,3. After second5:9,3,3.\n\nSo line2's output: [2,9,9,5,9,9,9,5,9,3,3]\n\nBut looking at the training examples, this doesn't fit. For example, Example0's line0 would have previous line2's first three4,4,1 reversed1,4,4. So after first5:1,4,4. But the actual output is4,4,1. So this doesn't fit.\n\nThus, this approach is incorrect.\n\nAfter all this, I think the correct pattern is that each output linei's first filled segment is the input linei's own first three elements, and the second filled segment is the reverse of the same. But this doesn't fit all examples.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the first filled segment after first5 is the next line's first three elements, and the second filled is the previous line's first three elements reversed.\n\nBut given the time I've spent and the need to provide an answer, I'll proceed with this pattern for the test input."
