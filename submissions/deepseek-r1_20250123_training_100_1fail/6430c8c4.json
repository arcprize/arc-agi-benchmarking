        "cot_1": "Okay, let's tackle this puzzle. So, the task is to figure out the pattern that transforms the given input lists into the output lists. There are four training examples, each with a set of input arrays and an output array. My job is to find out what's common across these examples and apply it to the test input.\n\nFirst, I need to look at each training example carefully. Let's start with Example 0. The input has nine lists, and the output has four lists. The output arrays are all 4 elements long. Let me note the counts here. The input has 9 rows, the output 4 rows. Hmm, maybe the output is derived from processing the input rows in some way, perhaps combining or transforming certain rows.\n\nLooking at the numbers in the input and output, I notice that the outputs consist of 0s and 3s. So maybe the 3s are appearing where certain conditions are met. Let's check the inputs for each example's output.\n\nFor Example 0's output:\n\nOutput rows are:\n[0, 0, 3, 0]\n[3, 0, 0, 0]\n[0, 0, 0, 0]\n[0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nLooking at the input for Example 0, the first four input rows are:\n[7,7,0,7],\n[0,7,7,0],\n[0,7,7,7],\n[0,7,7,0],\nThen comes [4,4,4,4], and others. The fifth row is all 4s. Maybe the 4s are a separator? Let's check other examples.\n\nIn Example 1, the fifth input row is also [4,4,4,4]. Similarly, Example 2 and 3 have the fifth row as four 4s. So perhaps the input is divided into two parts: the first four rows, then the fifth row as a separator, then four more rows. But the output has four rows. Maybe the output is generated based on combining the first four and the next four rows after the fifth.\n\nWait, the test input has nine rows as well. Let's see. For each example:\n\nInput structure:\n- 9 rows, each with 4 elements.\n- The fifth row is [4,4,4,4] in all training examples and the test input. So that's a key point. The fifth row is a separator.\n\nSo maybe the first four rows are group A, rows 6-9 are group B, and the output is generated by comparing or combining elements from group A and group B.\n\nLooking at Example 0's output, how does it relate to the input?\n\nIn Example 0's input:\n\nGroup A (rows 0-3):\n[7,7,0,7]\n[0,7,7,0]\n[0,7,7,7]\n[0,7,7,0]\n\nGroup B (rows 5-8, since row 4 is the separator):\n[0,0,0,0]\n[0,2,0,2]\n[2,2,2,0]\n[2,0,0,2]\n\nOutput is four rows. Let's look at the output's first row [0,0,3,0]. Maybe each position in the output is determined by some interaction between group A and group B.\n\nWait, the output rows have four elements each, and there are four output rows. So perhaps each output row corresponds to a combination of group A and group B elements. For example, maybe each column in group A and group B is processed.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each output cell is 3 if certain conditions are met in the corresponding positions of group A and group B.\n\nLet me check the positions where 3s appear in the outputs and see what the corresponding group A and group B elements are.\n\nTake Example 0's output first row: [0,0,3,0]. The third element is 3. Let's see the group A's first row's third element: 0. Group B's first row (row 5) is [0,0,0,0]. The third element here is 0. Hmm, maybe that's not directly it. Wait, group B is rows 5-8. Wait, maybe each output row is a combination of group A rows and group B rows. Let's see:\n\nIn Example 0, output has four rows. Let's see if each output row is combining a row from group A and group B. For example, output row 0 could be combining group A row 0 and group B row 0 (row 5). Let's check:\n\nGroup A row 0: [7,7,0,7]\nGroup B row 0 (input row 5): [0,0,0,0]\nOutput row 0: [0,0,3,0]\n\nHmm, how does 7 and 0 lead to 0, 0, 3, 0? Not sure yet. Maybe there's a different approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is formed by considering pairs of rows from group A and group B. For example, output row 0 is group A row 0 and group B row 0, etc. But since there are four group A rows and four group B rows (rows 5-8), each output row could be a combination of group A and group B in some way.\n\nWait, let's look for another pattern. The outputs have 3s and 0s. Let me check if the sum of the elements in group A and group B at a certain position leads to 3. For example, in Example 0's output first row third element is 3. Let's see group A row 0 third element:0, group B row 0 third element:0. Sum is 0, which doesn't make sense.\n\nAnother angle: Maybe 3s are placed where there's a transition or a certain number of occurrences. Let's check Example 0's output. The first three output rows have a 3 each. Let's see:\n\nIn the output's first row, third position is 3. Group A's first row is [7,7,0,7]. Group B's first row (row 5) is [0,0,0,0]. Maybe when group A has 0 and group B has 0, but that's 0 here. That doesn't explain the 3.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's looking for where group A and group B elements sum to a certain value. Let's check:\n\nIn Example 0, group A row 0 is [7,7,0,7], group B row 0 (row5) is [0,0,0,0]. The sum for each position would be 7,7,0,7. The output is 0,0,3,0. Doesn't seem to align.\n\nWait, maybe it's about the number 7 and 2 in the input. Let's look at the input groups. Group A has 7s and 0s. Group B has 0s, 2s, and 4s (but 4s are in the separator row). The output has 3s. Maybe 7 and 2 relate to 3 (since 7-2=5, but 7+2=9? Not obvious. Alternatively, 7 modulo 4 is 3, and 2+1=3? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the positions where group A and group B have certain numbers. For example, if group A has a 7 and group B has a 2 in the same position, then output a 3. Let's check:\n\nTake Example 0, output row 0. The third element is 3. Group A row 0 third element is 0. Group B row 5 (row5) third element is 0. So that's not matching. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's looking for the presence of 7 in group A and 2 in group B in the same column but across different rows. Maybe the output is generated by checking columns across the group A and group B.\n\nWait, the output has four rows and four columns. Maybe each output row corresponds to a column in the original input. Let's see:\n\nFor Example 0, the first output row is [0,0,3,0]. Let's check the columns of group A and group B.\n\nGroup A (rows 0-3) columns:\n\nColumn 0: 7,0,0,0\nColumn 1:7,7,7,7\nColumn 2:0,7,7,7\nColumn 3:7,0,7,0\n\nGroup B (rows5-8):\n\nRow5: [0,0,0,0]\nRow6: [0,2,0,2]\nRow7: [2,2,2,0]\nRow8: [2,0,0,2]\n\nSo group B columns:\n\nColumn0:0,0,2,2\nColumn1:0,2,2,0\nColumn2:0,0,2,0\nColumn3:0,2,0,2\n\nHmm, perhaps for each column in group A and group B, some condition is checked to generate the output.\n\nIn Example 0's output first row is [0,0,3,0]. Let's check column 0. For group A column 0: [7,0,0,0]. Group B column 0: [0,0,2,2]. How to get output row 0's elements. Maybe output row corresponds to the sum of certain elements in the columns.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is a grid where each cell (i,j) is determined by some function of group A's row i and group B's row j. But since there are four rows in group A and four in group B, maybe the output is a 4x4 matrix where each cell is the result of processing group A's row i and group B's row j.\n\nBut in Example 0, the output is four rows of four elements each, which would fit a 4x4 matrix. Let's see:\n\nOutput row 0: [0,0,3,0]. Maybe each element here is computed from group A row 0 and group B row 0, row 1, etc.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by combining each row of group A with each row of group B in some way. But that would lead to 4x4=16 outputs, but here the output is four rows of four elements, which is a 4x4 matrix. So perhaps that's the case.\n\nWait, but in the training examples, the output is a list of four lists each of four elements. So the output is a 4x4 grid. Then perhaps for each cell (i,j) in the output, we look at group A's row i and group B's row j, and compute some value based on those two rows.\n\nLet's take Example 0's output cell (0,2) which is 3. Let's see group A row 0: [7,7,0,7], group B row 2 (input row7): [2,2,2,0]. How do these lead to 3?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the number of overlapping 7s in group A's row and 2s in group B's row? Or some other relation.\n\nAlternatively, the sum of elements in group A's row and group B's row? For group A row 0 sum:7+7+0+7=21. Group B row 0 sum:0. Sum is 21. But the output is 0. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the count of positions where group A has 7 and group B has 2 in the same column. Let's see.\n\nFor group A row i and group B row j, count the number of columns where group A's element is 7 and group B's element is 2. Then, if that count is non-zero, put 3 in position (i,j). Or maybe the count is represented as 3. Let's test this.\n\nExample0's output cell (0,2) is 3. Let's see group A row 0 and group B row 2 (input row7). Group A row0: [7,7,0,7]. Group B row2 (row7): [2,2,2,0]. So columns where A is 7 and B is 2:\n\nColumn0: 7 vs 2 \u2192 yes.\nColumn1:7 vs2\u2192 yes.\nColumn2:0 vs2\u2192 no.\nColumn3:7 vs0\u2192 no.\nTotal of 2 positions. But the output here is 3. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the sum of such positions modulo something. If there are two matches, sum is 2, but output is 3. Doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe when there are at least one such position, output 3. But in that case, any cell with at least one overlap would be 3, else 0. Let's check for Example0's output:\n\nLooking at output row0: [0,0,3,0]. So cell (0,2) is 3. Let's see group B row2 is input row7: [2,2,2,0]. Group A row0: [7,7,0,7]. The columns where A has 7 and B has 2 are columns 0,1,2 (since B's column2 is 2 and A's is 0 \u2192 no). So columns 0 and1. So two positions. Why is the output 3 here?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the number of such positions is multiplied by a certain value. But 2 * something equals 3? That's not possible. Hmm.\n\nLet me check another example. Take Example1's output first row [0,3,0,0]. Let's see group A row0 and group B rows. For output row0, cell (0,1) is 3. Group B row1 is input row6: [2,0,2,0]. Group A row0 is [0,0,7,7]. So looking for columns where A has 7 and B has 2. Columns 2 and3: A has7, B has2 in column2 (since B row6 is [2,0,2,0]. So columns0 and 2. For column2: A is7, B is2. So that's one occurrence. So output is 3 here. So perhaps each occurrence adds 3? But that would be 3 per occurrence. But that's not the case here. Wait, in this case, there's one occurrence, so 3. That matches.\n\nIn Example0's cell (0,2), group A row0 and group B row2 (input row7). Group A row0 has 7s in columns0,1,3. Group B row2 (input row7) is [2,2,2,0]. So columns where A is7 and B is2 are 0,1. So two occurrences. But output is 3. Hmm, that's two. So maybe it's not the count.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's 3 if there's at least one occurrence. But in Example0's cell (0,2), two occurrences, output 3. In Example1's cell (0,1), one occurrence, output3. So that's possible. Then why in some cells there are 0s?\n\nBut let's check a cell with 0. Example0's output row0, column0:0. Group A row0, column0 is7. Group B row0 (input row5) is [0,0,0,0]. So B has 0 here. So no overlap. So 0. So the rule could be: in the output cell (i,j), set to 3 if there is at least one column where group A's row i has a7 and group B's row j has a2 in the same column. Otherwise 0.\n\nTesting this hypothesis:\n\nExample0's cell (0,2): group A row0 and group B row2 (input row7). As above, two columns where A=7 and B=2. So yes, output is3. So fits.\n\nAnother example: Example1's output row0, column1 is3. Group A row0: [0,0,7,7], group B row1 (input row6): [2,0,2,0]. Check columns where A=7 and B=2: columns2 and3. A's column2 and3 are7, B's column0 and2 are2. So in column2: A=7 and B=2 \u2192 yes. So there's one occurrence. So output is3. That fits.\n\nAnother cell: Example0's output row1 is [3,0,0,0]. So cell (1,0) is3. Group A row1: [0,7,7,0], group B row0 (input row5): [0,0,0,0]. Check columns where A=7 (columns1 and2) and B=0. No overlap. So why is this 3? Wait, group B row0 is all 0s. So no 2s. So according to the hypothesis, this cell should be0, but it's3. So that contradicts the hypothesis.\n\nHmm, so maybe the hypothesis is incorrect.\n\nAlternative approach: Let's think about the numbers. The outputs are 0s and 3s. 3 is likely derived from the combination of 7 and 4, but the 4s are in the separator row. Wait, the separator row is [4,4,4,4]. Maybe it's a red herring.\n\nAlternatively, considering that 7-4=3. Maybe when a 7 in group A and a 4 in the same column of the separator row (row4) is present, but row4 is all 4s. But that's the same for all columns, so that might not be it.\n\nAnother angle: group B (rows5-8) have 0s and 2s. So maybe the presence of 2s in group B's rows and 7s in group A's rows.\n\nWait, group A has 7s and 0s, group B has 0s and 2s, and the output is 3s where some condition is met. Let's think of 7 as a certain value and 2 as another. Maybe 3 represents a combination, like 7 is in group A, 2 in group B, and the sum is 9 (7+2=9), but modulo 6 gives 3. Or 7-2=5, but not sure. Alternatively, 7 in binary is 111, 2 is 10, but combining them gives 11110 which is 30 in decimal. Not directly 3.\n\nAlternatively, think of the numbers as positions. For example, 7 could represent a certain direction or position, and 2 another, but not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps the output is counting the number of times a 7 in group A and a 2 in group B appear in the same column, across all rows. But since the output is 4x4, maybe for each combination of group A's row and group B's row, the output cell is 3 if there's at least one column where group A's row has a 7 and group B's row has a 2, and 0 otherwise.\n\nWait, let's test this again with Example0's output row1, cell (1,0)=3.\n\nGroup A row1: [0,7,7,0]\nGroup B row0 (input row5): [0,0,0,0]. So group B row0 has no 2s. So according to this rule, the output should be 0, but in the output it's3. Contradiction. So this can't be.\n\nAlternative idea: Maybe the output is based on group B's row and group A's row in a different way. Like, for each column in the output, check group A's column and group B's column for certain patterns.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is generated by looking at the sum of 7s in group A's column and 2s in group B's column. For example, in each output cell (i,j), if the sum of 7s in group A's column i and 2s in group B's column j is a certain value, then output 3. But not sure.\n\nLet me take Example0's output first row [0,0,3,0]. Let's look at column 2. Maybe group A's column 2 and group B's column 0.\n\nGroup A's column2 in example0 is [0 (row0),7 (row1),7 (row2),7 (row3)] \u2192 sum is 0+7+7+7=21.\n\nGroup B's column0 (rows5-8) is [0 (row5),0 (row6),2 (row7),2 (row8)] \u2192 sum is 0+0+2+2=4.\n\nSum 21 +4=25. Doesn't relate to 3.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the product of the count of 7s in group A's column and the count of 2s in group B's column. For example, group A column2 has 3 7s (rows1-3), group B column0 has 2 2s (rows7,8). 3*2=6. Not 3.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternative approach: Let's consider the output as a 4x4 grid where each cell (i,j) corresponds to the number of times a 7 appears in group A's row i and a 2 appears in group B's row j in the same column. If that count is non-zero, set to3, else 0.\n\nWait, let's check Example0's output cell (0,2) which is3. Group A row0: [7,7,0,7]. Group B row2 (input row7): [2,2,2,0]. Columns where A is7 and B is2:\n\nColumn0:7 vs2 \u2192 yes.\nColumn1:7 vs2\u2192 yes.\nColumn2:0 vs2\u2192 no.\nColumn3:7 vs0\u2192 no.\nSo count is2. But output is3. So maybe if the count is >=1, output3. So in this case, count is2, output3.\n\nIn Example1's output row0, column1 is3. Group A row0: [0,0,7,7]. Group B row1: [2,0,2,0]. Columns where A is7 and B is2: columns2 and3 (A has7, B has2 in column2 and0 in column3. So column2 is7 and2. So count is1. So output3.\n\nAnother example: Example0's output row1, cell (1,0)=3. Group A row1: [0,7,7,0]. Group B row0 (row5: all 0s). So no 2s in group B row0. So count is0. But output is3. Contradicts.\n\nSo this approach is not working.\n\nAlternative idea: Maybe the output is determined by the sum of group A's row and group B's row, then modulo 3. For example, group A row0 sum is21, group B row0 sum is0. Sum 21 mod3=0. Which matches output row0's first element 0. But output row0's third element is3. Let's see group A row0 sum21, group B row2 sum is2+2+2+0=6. 21+6=27 mod3=0. But output cell (0,2) is3. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the product of group A row sum and group B row sum mod something. 21*6=126 mod4 is 2. Not 3.\n\nHmm. This is tricky.\n\nLet me look for another pattern. The output in Example0 has four rows, each row has 3s in certain positions. Let's see if there's a positional pattern. For example, in Example0's output, the 3s are in positions (0,2), (1,0). In Example1's output, 3s are in (0,1), (1,0), (2,0), (2,3), (3,3). It's hard to see a spatial pattern.\n\nAnother idea: Maybe the output is a transposed version of some calculation. For example, group A and group B are combined in a way that columns become rows. For example, group A's column0 and group B's column0 might form a row in the output.\n\nBut how? Let's look at Example0's output:\n\nOutput rows are:\n[0,0,3,0]\n[3,0,0,0]\n[0,0,0,0]\n[0,0,0,0]\n\nGroup A's columns:\n\nColumn0:7,0,0,0 \u2192 sum7+0+0+0=7.\n\nGroup B's columns (rows5-8):\n\nColumn0:0,0,2,2 \u2192 sum4.\n\nNot sure how this relates to output.\n\nAlternatively, maybe for each column in group A and group B, we count the number of 7s and 2s respectively, then do something. For example:\n\nIn Example0's group A column0: 7,0,0,0 \u2192 one 7.\n\nGroup B column0:0,0,2,2 \u2192 two 2s.\n\n1*2=2. But output for this column? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, if in a column of group A there are m 7s and in group B column n 2s, then the product m*n is the number of 3s in that column of the output. Let's check:\n\nIn Example0:\n\nGroup A column0: 1 seven.\n\nGroup B column0: two 2s.\n\n1*2=2. But how does this translate to the output?\n\nLooking at output columns, column0 in Example0's output has a 3 in row1 (cell (1,0)), and 0s elsewhere. So only one 3. Hmm, 2 vs1. Doesn't match.\n\nAnother approach: Let's look at the test input and see if we can find any clues. The test input is:\n\nGroup A (rows0-3):\n[7,7,7,7],\n[0,7,7,7],\n[7,0,0,0],\n[7,0,7,0]\n\nGroup B (rows5-8):\n[0,2,2,2],\n[0,0,0,0],\n[2,0,2,2],\n[0,2,0,0]\n\nThe separator row is [4,4,4,4].\n\nWe need to generate the output based on the pattern from the training examples.\n\nLooking at the training examples' outputs, the 3s are placed where certain interactions between group A and group B occur. For example, in Example3's output:\n\n[0,3,0,0]\n[3,3,0,0]\n[0,3,0,0]\n[0,0,3,0]\n\nLet's see group A and group B for Example3.\n\nGroup A (rows0-3):\n[7,0,7,0],\n[0,0,7,7],\n[7,0,7,7],\n[7,7,0,0]\n\nGroup B (rows5-8):\n[0,0,2,2],\n[0,0,0,0],\n[2,0,0,2],\n[0,2,0,2]\n\nOutput row0 is [0,3,0,0]. Suppose this is combining group A row0 and group B row1 (input row6: [0,0,0,0]. So group B row1 has all 0s, so according to previous hypotheses, output should be 0. But the output is [0,3,0,0]. So maybe the row indices are different.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is formed by checking for each position in the grid whether the corresponding group A row has a 7 in the same column as any group B row has a 2. But I'm not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps the output is a 4x4 matrix where each cell (i,j) is 3 if there's at least one column where group A's row i and group B's row j have a 7 and a 2 respectively. Otherwise 0.\n\nLet's test this hypothesis with Example0:\n\nOutput row0, cell (0,2)=3.\n\nGroup A row0: [7,7,0,7].\n\nGroup B row2 (input row7): [2,2,2,0].\n\nCheck columns where A has7 and B has2:\n\nColumns0:7 vs2 \u2192 yes.\n\nColumn1:7 vs2 \u2192 yes.\n\nColumn2:0 vs2 \u2192 no.\n\nColumn3:7 vs0 \u2192 no.\n\nSo there are two columns where this happens. So output is3. So the hypothesis holds here.\n\nAnother example: Example0's output row1, cell (1,0)=3.\n\nGroup A row1: [0,7,7,0].\n\nGroup B row0 (input row5): [0,0,0,0].\n\nLooking for columns where A has7 and B has2. B has no 2s. So output should be0. But the output is3. Contradiction.\n\nHmm, so the hypothesis is incorrect.\n\nAlternative idea: Maybe group B's rows are shifted or processed in a different way. For example, group B's rows are reversed or rotated.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output cell (i,j) is 3 if group A's row i has a 7 in column j and group B's row j has a 2 in column i. Let's check Example0's output cell (0,2)=3. group A row0, column2 is0. group B row2 (input row7), column0 is2. So i=0, j=2. group A row0 column j=2 is0. So that's not 7. Doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, transpose the group B's rows. For example, group B's row becomes column.\n\nIn Example0's output row0, cell (0,2)=3. group A row0 has 7s in columns0,1,3. group B's column2 (from group B rows5-8):\n\nRow5: column2 is0.\n\nRow6: column2 is0.\n\nRow7: column2 is2.\n\nRow8: column2 is0.\n\nSo group B's column2 has one 2. So for group A row0's columns0,1,3 (7s) and group B's column2's 2. So maybe if group A's row i has a 7 in column k, and group B's column k has a 2 in row j, then output cell (i,j) is3. This is a bit complex, but let's test it.\n\nFor Example0's cell (0,2): group A row0 has 7s in columns0,1,3. For each of these columns, check group B's column k. For column0 in group B: rows5-8 are0,0,2,2. So group B's column0 has 2s in rows7 and8 (j=2 and3, if rows are 0-indexed). So for column0 in group A, group B's column0 has 2s in j=2 and3. So this would contribute to output cells (0,2) and (0,3). But in Example0's output row0, cell (0,2)=3 and cell (0,3)=0. So this doesn't fit.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Let's think of another approach.\n\nLooking at Example3's output:\n\nOutput row0: [0,3,0,0]\n\nGroup A row0: [7,0,7,0]\n\nGroup B rows5-8: [0,0,2,2], [0,0,0,0], [2,0,0,2], [0,2,0,2]\n\nMaybe output row0 is combining group A row0 with each group B row. For cell (0,1)=3:\n\nGroup B row1 is [0,0,0,0]. So no 2s. How does this cell get a 3?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is generated by something else, like the number of 7s in group A's row and 2s in group B's column.\n\nAlternatively, maybe for each output cell (i,j), we count the number of 2s in group B's row j that are in the same positions as 7s in group A's row i. If the count is >=1, output3, else0.\n\nLet's test this:\n\nExample0's cell (0,2)=3.\n\nGroup A row0: [7,7,0,7].\n\nGroup B row2 (input row7): [2,2,2,0].\n\nCheck positions where both are non-zero. But group A's 7s are in 0,1,3. Group B's 2s are in0,1,2. The overlapping positions are 0,1. So count is2. So output3. But why?\n\nMaybe each such overlapping position contributes to a 3, but the value is 3 regardless of the count.\n\nExample0's cell (1,0)=3.\n\nGroup A row1: [0,7,7,0].\n\nGroup B row0 (input row5): [0,0,0,0]. No 2s. So count is0. But output is3. Contradicts.\n\nThis approach isn't working.\n\nAlternative idea: Perhaps the output is related to the product of certain elements. For example, 7 * 2 =14 \u2192 1+4=5, but not 3. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, the output could be the count of times a 7 appears in group A and a 2 appears in group B in the same position across all rows. But that would generate a single number, not a 4x4 grid.\n\nHmm.\n\nAnother observation: In the training examples, the output's 3s are often placed in positions that seem to mirror certain arrangements. For example, in Example0's output, the first row has a 3 in the third position. Let me look at group B's third row (input row8): [2,0,0,2]. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is a result of some kind of matching between group A and group B's rows, where the presence of certain patterns in group B's rows triggers a 3 in the output. For example, if group B's row has a certain number of 2s, then the corresponding output cell is3.\n\nBut in Example0's output row1, cell (1,0)=3. Group B row0 has no 2s. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, the output is based on the number of 2s in group B's row. For example, if group B's row j has k 2s, then output row i, j is 3 if group A's row i has a7 in the position where group B's row j has the first 2. Or something like that.\n\nThis is getting too vague. Maybe I need to try a different approach.\n\nLet's think about the test input and see if I can spot a pattern from the training examples to apply.\n\nTest input:\n\nGroup A (rows0-3):\n[7,7,7,7],\n[0,7,7,7],\n[7,0,0,0],\n[7,0,7,0]\n\nGroup B (rows5-8):\n[0,2,2,2],  // row5\n[0,0,0,0],   // row6\n[2,0,2,2],   // row7\n[0,2,0,0]    // row8\n\nThe output is four rows of four elements each. Let's try to apply the hypothesis that each output cell (i,j) is 3 if there's at least one column where group A's row i has a7 and group B's row j has a2.\n\nLet's compute this for the test input.\n\nFor each i (0-3) and j (0-3):\n\ni=0 (group A row0: [7,7,7,7])\n\nj=0 (group B row5: [0,2,2,2])\n\nColumns where A has7 and B has2: columns1,2,3 \u2192 3 positions. So output cell (0,0) should be3.\n\nj=1 (group B row6: [0,0,0,0]) \u2192 no 2s. So cell (0,1)=0.\n\nj=2 (group B row7: [2,0,2,2]). A's row0 is all 7s. So columns0,2,3 where B has2. So three positions. So cell (0,2)=3.\n\nj=3 (group B row8: [0,2,0,0]). Column1: B has2. So cell (0,3)=3.\n\nSo output row0 would be [3,0,3,3].\n\nBut looking at the training examples, the outputs don't usually have multiple 3s in a row. For example, Example0's output row0 is [0,0,3,0]. So this might not be correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe only the first occurrence per row or some other condition.\n\nAlternatively, the output is 3 only if the number of overlapping columns is exactly 1. But in this case, for cell (0,0), there are three overlapping columns. So output would be0. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, if there's at least one overlapping column, output3. So for cell (0,0) it's3, (0,2)3, (0,3)3. So row0 would be [3,0,3,3]. But looking at the training examples, in Example1's output row2 is [3,0,0,3], which has two 3s. So multiple 3s per row are possible.\n\nBut let's see what the training examples have. Example0's output row0 has one3, row1 one3, others zero. Example1's output has 3s in multiple positions. So maybe the hypothesis is correct.\n\nBut let's check Example3's output row1: [3,3,0,0]. Group A row1: [0,0,7,7]. Group B row1: [0,0,0,0]. So no 2s. So according to the hypothesis, cell (1,1) should be0. But the output is3. Contradiction.\n\nHmm. So this approach doesn't work.\n\nAlternative idea: Maybe group B's rows are considered in reverse order. Like, j=0 corresponds to group B's row3, j=1 to row2, etc. Let's check.\n\nExample0's output cell (1,0)=3. Group A row1: [0,7,7,0]. Group B row0 (input row5: all 0s). If instead, j=0 corresponds to group B row3 (input row8: [2,0,0,2]). Then check columns where A row1 has7 and B row3 has2. A row1's7s are in columns1 and2. B row3's 2s are in columns0 and3. No overlap. So cell (1,0) would be0. But output is3. Doesn't fit.\n\nThis is really challenging. Let's try another angle: the output could represent a kind of matrix multiplication between group A and group B, but with different operations. For instance, instead of multiplying and summing, we're counting the number of positions where A has7 and B has2.\n\nSo for each output cell (i,j), it's the number of columns k where A[i][k] ==7 and B[j][k] ==2. Then, if that count is non-zero, output3, else0.\n\nLet's test this with Example0's cell (0,2)=3. group A row0: [7,7,0,7], group B row2 (input row7: [2,2,2,0]). Columns where A has7 and B has2 are k=0,1,2 (wait, A row0 has7 in 0,1,3. B row7 has2 in0,1,2. So overlapping columns are0,1. So count is2. But output is3. So this doesn't match. However, if we output3 for any count >=1, then yes. So for count=2, output3. So perhaps the rule is: output3 if there's at least one column where A[i][k] is7 and B[j][k] is2. Otherwise0.\n\nLet's test this with Example0's cell (1,0)=3. Group A row1: [0,7,7,0], group B row0 (input row5: all 0s). No columns where B has2. So output should be0. But in the example, output is3. Contradiction.\n\nSo this hypothesis is incorrect.\n\nAt this point, I'm stuck. Perhaps I need to look for another pattern.\n\nLooking at the test input's group A and group B:\n\nGroup A rows0-3:\nRow0: [7,7,7,7]\nRow1: [0,7,7,7]\nRow2: [7,0,0,0]\nRow3: [7,0,7,0]\n\nGroup B rows5-8:\nRow5: [0,2,2,2]\nRow6: [0,0,0,0]\nRow7: [2,0,2,2]\nRow8: [0,2,0,0]\n\nSuppose the output is generated by checking for each pair of group A and group B rows, and for each column, if A has7 and B has2, then increment a counter for that (i,j). Then, the output is3 if the counter is >=1, else0. So:\n\nFor test input:\n\nFor output cell (i,j):\n\nCheck if any column in group A rowi and group B rowj has 7 and 2.\n\nLet's compute this for each (i,j):\n\ni=0 (row0: all7s):\n\nj=0 (row5: 0,2,2,2):\n\nColumns1,2,3: B has2. So in these columns, A has7. So yes. So cell (0,0)=3.\n\nj=1 (row6: all0s): no 2s. cell (0,1)=0.\n\nj=2 (row7: 2,0,2,2):\n\nColumns0,2,3: B has2. A has7s in all columns. So yes. So cell (0,2)=3.\n\nj=3 (row8: 0,2,0,0):\n\nColumn1: B has2. A has7. So cell (0,3)=3.\n\nSo output row0: [3,0,3,3].\n\ni=1 (row1: 0,7,7,7):\n\nj=0 (row5: 0,2,2,2):\n\nIn row1, columns1,2,3 are7. B row5 columns1,2,3 are2. So columns1,2,3: A and B both have 7 and2. So cell (1,0)=3.\n\nj=1 (row6: 0s): no. So cell (1,1)=0.\n\nj=2 (row7: 2,0,2,2). B row7 columns0,2,3 have2. A row1 columns0:0, so only columns2,3. So columns2 and3. So cell (1,2)=3.\n\nj=3 (row8: 0,2,0,0). Column1. A row1 column1 is7. So cell (1,3)=3.\n\nSo output row1: [3,0,3,3].\n\ni=2 (row2:7,0,0,0):\n\nj=0 (row5:0,2,2,2). A row2 column0 is7. B row5 columns1,2,3 have2. So no overlap. Only column0 for A is7, B column0 is0. So no. So cell (2,0)=0.\n\nj=1 (row6: all0s). No. cell (2,1)=0.\n\nj=2 (row7:2,0,2,2). B columns0,2,3. A row2 has7 only in column0. B column0 is2. So yes. So cell (2,2)=3.\n\nj=3 (row8:0,2,0,0). A row2 column0 is7. B row8 column0 is0. No. B column1 is2. A row2 column1 is0. So no. So cell (2,3)=0.\n\nSo output row2: [0,0,3,0].\n\ni=3 (row3:7,0,7,0):\n\nj=0 (row5:0,2,2,2). A columns0 and2 are7. B columns1,2,3 are2. So column2: A is7, B is2. So cell (3,0)=3.\n\nj=1 (row6:0s). No. cell (3,1)=0.\n\nj=2 (row7:2,0,2,2). A columns0 and2 are7. B columns0,2,3 are2. So columns0 and2. So cell (3,2)=3.\n\nj=3 (row8:0,2,0,0). A columns0 and2 are7. B column1 is2. No overlap. So cell (3,3)=0.\n\nSo output row3: [3,0,3,0].\n\nPutting it all together, the output would be:\n\n[3,0,3,3]\n[3,0,3,3]\n[0,0,3,0]\n[3,0,3,0]\n\nBut looking at the training examples, the outputs have varying numbers of 3s. For example, Example3's output is:\n\n[0,3,0,0]\n[3,3,0,0]\n[0,3,0,0]\n[0,0,3,0]\n\nBut according to this hypothesis, the test input's output would have multiple 3s. However, looking at the training examples, Example0's output has only two 3s. So this suggests that this hypothesis is incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is the count of such overlaps, but modulo 4. For example, 3 is the remainder when count is3. But in the test input's cell (0,0), the count is3, so output3. But in Example0's cell (0,2), the count is2, which modulo4 is2, but output is3. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAt this point, I'm struggling to find a pattern. Perhaps I need to look for a different approach. For instance, maybe the output is the sum of 7s in group A and 2s in group B for each row or column, but adjusted in some way.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is determined by the positions of 7s in group A and 2s in group B, but considering their row indices. For example, if group A's row i has a7 in column k and group B's row k has a2 in column j, then output cell (i,j) is3.\n\nLet's test this with Example0's cell (0,2)=3.\n\nGroup A row0 has7s in columns0,1,3. For each of these columns k, group B's row k column j must be2. But j is the column in the output cell. For output cell (0,2), j=2. So group B's rowk column2.\n\nFor k=0: group B row0 (row5) column2 is0. Not 2.\n\nFor k=1: group B row1 (row6) column2 is0.\n\nFor k=3: group B row3 (row8) column2 is0. So no 2s. So this doesn't explain the 3.\n\nThis is getting too convoluted. Maybe I should consider that the output is based on the number of 7s in group A's row and 2s in group B's row, but not necessarily in the same column. For example, if group A's row i has a total of m 7s and group B's row j has a total of n 2s, then output cell (i,j) is3 if m*n >= something.\n\nExample0's cell (0,2): group A row0 has4 7s. group B row2 (row7) has3 2s. 4*3=12. Maybe 12 mod4=0. So output0. But the cell is3. Doesn't fit.\n\nAnother idea: the output is a 4x4 matrix where each cell (i,j) is 3 if the sum of group A's row i and group B's row j contains a3. But how?\n\nAlternatively, the output cell (i,j) is3 if the sum of group A's row i and group B's row j in any column equals9 (7+2). For example, in Example0's cell (0,2):\n\nGroup A row0:7,7,0,7.\n\nGroup B row2:2,2,2,0.\n\nSum by column:9,9,2,7. So two columns sum to9. So output3.\n\nThis could work. Let's test other examples.\n\nExample0's cell (1,0)=3.\n\nGroup A row1:0,7,7,0.\n\nGroup B row0:0,0,0,0.\n\nSum:0,7,7,0. No sum of9. So cell should be0. But output is3. Contradicts.\n\nHmm.\n\nAnother angle: perhaps the output is the count of columns where group A and group B's rows sum to7+2=9. For each such occurrence, output3. But Example0's cell (0,2) would have two such columns (0 and1), so output3. But then how to get the 3.\n\nAlternatively, if any column sums to9, output3. So cell is3 if at least one column sums to9.\n\nFor Example0's cell (0,2): columns0 and1 sum to9 \u2192 cell3.\n\nExample0's cell (1,0): group A row1 sum is14, group B row0 sum0. So column sums:0,7,7,0. No 9s. So cell should be0. But output is3. Contradicts.\n\nThis approach also doesn't work.\n\nAt this point, I'm stuck. I'll need to make an educated guess based on the test input and the training examples. \n\nGiven the test input group A and B:\n\nLet's try applying the hypothesis that output cell (i,j) is3 if there's at least one column where group A rowi has7 and group B rowj has2. Let's proceed with this for the test input.\n\nThen, the output would be:\n\nRow0 (i=0) with group B rows:\n\nj=0: row5 has2s in columns1,2,3. group A row0 has7s everywhere \u2192 yes. So cell (0,0)=3.\n\nj=1: row6 has no 2s \u21920.\n\nj=2: row7 has2s in0,2,3 \u2192 group A row0 has7s here \u2192 yes. cell (0,2)=3.\n\nj=3: row8 has2 in column1 \u2192 group A row0 has7 \u2192 yes. cell (0,3)=3.\n\nSo row0: [3,0,3,3].\n\nRow1 (i=1):\n\ngroup A row1: [0,7,7,7].\n\nj=0 (row5: 0,2,2,2). Columns1,2,3 have2s. group A row1 has7s there \u2192 yes. cell (1,0)=3.\n\nj=1 (row6:0s) \u21920.\n\nj=2 (row7:2 in0,2,3 \u2192 group A row1 has7 in columns1,2,3. So columns2 and3. yes \u2192 cell (1,2)=3.\n\nj=3 (row8:2 in column1 \u2192 group A row1 has7 \u2192 yes. cell (1,3)=3.\n\nSo row1: [3,0,3,3].\n\nRow2 (i=2):\n\ngroup A row2: [7,0,0,0].\n\nj=0 (row5: columns1,2,3 have2s. group A row2 has7 in column0 \u2192 no overlap. So cell (2,0)=0.\n\nj=1: row6 \u21920.\n\nj=2 (row7:2 in0,2,3 \u2192 group A row2 has7 in0 \u2192 cell (2,2)=3.\n\nj=3 (row8:2 in1 \u2192 group A row2 has0. So no. cell (2,3)=0.\n\nRow2: [0,0,3,0].\n\nRow3 (i=3):\n\ngroup A row3: [7,0,7,0].\n\nj=0 (row5: columns1,2,3 have2s. group A row3 has7 in columns0 and2. So column2: yes. cell (3,0)=3.\n\nj=1: row6 \u21920.\n\nj=2 (row7:2 in0,2,3. group A row3 has7 in0 and2. So columns0 and2 \u2192 yes. cell (3,2)=3.\n\nj=3 (row8:2 in1 \u2192 group A row3 has0. So no. cell (3,3)=0.\n\nRow3: [3,0,3,0].\n\nSo the output would be:\n\n[3,0,3,3]\n\n[3,0,3,3]\n\n[0,0,3,0]\n\n[3,0,3,0]\n\nBut looking at the training examples, none of them have consecutive rows with multiple 3s like this. For example, Example0's output has only two 3s in total. This suggests that this hypothesis is likely incorrect. However, since I can't find another pattern, perhaps this is the intended solution, and the training examples have certain specific cases where the overlaps are fewer.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a mistake in my hypothesis. For example, maybe the output is transposed, or the rows/columns are processed differently.\n\nAnother observation: In the training examples, the output's 3s are often arranged in a way that seems to form a diamond or other shape. For example, Example0's output has 3s in positions (0,2) and (1,0). Example1's output has a 3 in (0,1), (1,0), (2,0), (2,3), (3,3). It's possible that the 3s are placed where the sum of the row and column indices equals a certain value. For example, in Example0's cell (0,2), 0+2=2. Example1's cell (0,1), 0+1=1. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the result of a bitwise operation between group A and group B, but that's unlikely given the numbers 7 and 2.\n\nAfter struggling for so long, I'll proceed with the initial hypothesis and generate the output as per the overlapping columns of 7s and 2s.",

        "cot_2": "Okay, let's see. I need to figure out the pattern that transforms the input lists into the output lists. Let's look at the training examples first.\n\nEach example has an input that's a list of several 4-element lists. The output is another set of 4-element lists. Let's start by analyzing Example 0.\n\nIn Example 0's input, the first four rows are:\n\n[7,7,0,7]\n[0,7,7,0]\n[0,7,7,7]\n[0,7,7,0]\n\nThen there are more rows, but the output is four rows. So maybe the first four input rows are not the ones being transformed. Let me check all the examples.\n\nLooking at all training examples, each input has 9 rows. The output has 4 rows. So perhaps the transformation involves combining data from these 9 rows into 4 output rows. Let's see how that might work.\n\nWait, the output rows are 4, and maybe each output row corresponds to a combination of some input rows. Let me look for possible operations. For example, maybe adding certain rows together, or some kind of element-wise operation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is derived from the arrangement of numbers in the input. Let's see the numbers: 7, 0, 4, 2 are present. The outputs have 0, 3. So perhaps 7, 4, 2 are transformed into 0 or 3 based on some rules.\n\nLooking at Example 0's input and output. Let's check the first output row [0,0,3,0]. How does that relate to the input. Let's look at the input rows. The fifth row is [4,4,4,4]. Maybe the fifth row is a separator. Let's see other examples: yes, in all examples, the fifth row is [4,4,4,4]. So perhaps the input is split into two parts: the first four rows, then the fifth as a separator, then rows 6-9. Then maybe the output is derived from the first four rows and the next four rows (rows 6-9) after the separator.\n\nWait, the outputs in Example 0 have four rows. Let's check if the input after the fifth row (rows 6-9) are four rows. But in Example 0, the input has rows 6-9 as:\n\n[0,0,0,0]\n[0,2,0,2]\n[2,2,2,0]\n[2,0,0,2]\n\nHmm. But the output is four rows. So perhaps the output is generated by combining the first four rows and the next four rows (rows 6-9) in some way. Let me check.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's about how numbers from the first part (rows 0-3) and the second part (rows 5-8, since row 4 is all 4s) interact. Let's see.\n\nIn Example 0's output, the numbers are 0 and 3. Let's see where 3 comes from. Maybe when certain conditions are met between the first part and the second part. For example, looking at the first output element [0,0,3,0], maybe in the third position, a 3 appears. Let's check the corresponding positions in the input.\n\nLooking at the first output row's third element being 3. Let's see the first part (rows 0-3) and second part (rows 5-8). For example, in Example 0, the first part's rows 0-3:\n\nRow0: [7,7,0,7]\n\nRow1: [0,7,7,0]\n\nRow2: [0,7,7,7]\n\nRow3: [0,7,7,0]\n\nThe second part (rows5-8):\n\nRow5: [0,0,0,0]\n\nRow6: [0,2,0,2]\n\nRow7: [2,2,2,0]\n\nRow8: [2,0,0,2]\n\nNow, maybe each output cell is determined by some condition between the corresponding cells in the first part and the second part. For instance, for a given position (i,j) in the output, maybe looking at the value in the first part's cell (i,j) and the second part's cell (i,j), and applying a rule.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is generated by checking, for each position, how many times a certain condition is met across the two parts. Let's take the third element in the first output row of Example 0 being 3. Let's look at row0's third element in the first part: 0. Then in the second part, rows5-8, third elements: 0 (row5), 0 (row6), 2 (row7), 0 (row8). Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 3s are placed where certain pairs of numbers from the first and second parts meet. For example, if a cell in the first part (rows0-3) is 7 and the same cell in the corresponding row in the second part (rows5-8) is 2, then maybe the output is 3.\n\nWait, looking at Example 0's output first row, third element is 3. Let's check the first part (row0-3) and second part (rows5-8) for that position.\n\nFirst part's row0, third element: 0.\n\nSecond part's row5, third element: 0.\n\nHmm, that doesn't fit. Maybe another approach.\n\nWait, perhaps the output is constructed by looking at the positions where 7s in the first part (rows0-3) align with 2s in the second part (rows5-8). Let's check for Example 0.\n\nOutput's first row is [0,0,3,0]. Let's check each position:\n\nFirst column (index 0):\n\nIn first part rows0-3, column0: 7 (row0), 0 (row1), 0 (row2), 0 (row3). So 7 is present once.\n\nIn second part rows5-8, column0: 0 (row5), 0 (row6), 2 (row7), 2 (row8). So 2s in rows7 and8.\n\nIf the output is counting how many times a 7 in the first part's column0 (rows0-3) aligns with a 2 in the same column in the second part (rows5-8) for the same row. But rows0-3 are 4 rows, and rows5-8 are 4 rows. So row0 in first part corresponds to row5 in second part? Let's see:\n\nFor output row0, maybe the first part's row0 and the second part's row5, row6, row7, row8? Or perhaps each output row corresponds to a pair of rows from the two parts.\n\nAlternatively, maybe for each position in the output, it's the count of pairs where a 7 in the first part's row0-3 and a 2 in the second part's row5-8, in the same column. But how does that result in 3?\n\nAlternatively, maybe for each column in the output, we look down the rows. For example, in the third column of the output's first row in Example 0, the value is 3. Let's see:\n\nFirst part (rows0-3) third column:\n\nRow0:0, row1:7, row2:7, row3:7.\n\nSecond part (rows5-8) third column:\n\nRow5:0, row6:0, row7:2, row8:0.\n\nSo in the third column, the first part has 0,7,7,7. The second part has 0,0,2,0. So when a 7 in the first part and a 2 in the second part are in the same row. Let's check row7 (row index 7 in the input, which is the third row in the second part, since rows5-8 are indexes5,6,7,8). So in third column of row7 (input row7) is 2. The corresponding row in the first part would be row3 (since 5-8 correspond to first part rows0-3? Not sure). Wait, input rows0-3 are first part, then rows5-8 are second part. So row0 (first part) corresponds to row5 (second part?), row1 to row6, row2 to row7, row3 to row8?\n\nIf that's the case, then in the third column, for each pair of rows (row0 and row5, row1 and row6, row2 and row7, row3 and row8), check if first part has 7 and second part has 2. The count of such pairs would be the value in the output's row.\n\nWait, let's take Example0's output first row. Let's see for each column:\n\nColumn 0: output is 0.\n\nCheck pairs row0 (7) and row5 (0), row1 (0) and row6 (0), row2 (0) and row7 (2), row3 (0) and row8 (2). So 7 and 0 (no), 0 and 0 (no), 0 and 2 (no), 0 and 2 (no). So no matches. So output is 0.\n\nColumn1: output is 0.\n\nCheck first part rows0-3 column1: 7,7,7,7.\n\nSecond part rows5-8 column1: 0,2,2,0.\n\nLooking for pairs where first is 7 and second is 2.\n\nRow0 (7) and row5 (0): no.\n\nRow1 (7) and row6 (2): yes.\n\nRow2 (7) and row7 (2): yes.\n\nRow3 (7) and row8 (0): no.\n\nSo two instances. But output is 0. Hmm, this doesn't add up.\n\nWait, maybe the output is the sum of such matches. But in column1, if there are two matches, but the output is 0, so that can't be it. Maybe I'm missing something.\n\nAlternative idea: perhaps the output is a 4x4 grid, which is derived from some interaction between the first four rows (4x4?) and the next four rows. Wait, the input rows are 9 rows (including the fifth row of all 4s). The first four are part of one group, then after the 4s, the next four rows (rows5-8) are another group. Then perhaps each output cell is 3 if there's a 7 in the first group's row and a 2 in the same position in the second group's row. Let's check.\n\nIn Example0's output, the third column of the first row is 3. Let's see:\n\nFirst group's first row (row0) has [7,7,0,7]. The third element is 0. Second group's first row (row5) is [0,0,0,0]. Third element is 0. No 7 and 2 here.\n\nWait, maybe the output rows are each corresponding to a column in the input. Or perhaps the output is a matrix where each element counts the number of times a 7 in the first four rows and a 2 in the next four rows (after the 4s) appear in the same position across all the rows. For example, for each position (i,j) in the output, count how many times in the first four rows there's a 7 at (k,j) and in the next four rows (rows5-8) there's a 2 at (k,j). Sum over k from 0 to 3.\n\nLet's test this for Example0's output:\n\nFor output position (0,2) which is 3.\n\nLooking at column2 across the first four rows:\n\nRow0:0, row1:7, row2:7, row3:7.\n\nColumn2 in the first part (rows0-3) has 0,7,7,7.\n\nIn the second part (rows5-8), column2:\n\nRow5:0, row6:0, row7:2, row8:0.\n\nSo for each row k (0-3), check if first part's row k, column2 is 7 and second part's row (5+k) column2 is 2.\n\nWait, rows5-8 are rows5,6,7,8. So k=0 (first part row0) corresponds to row5 in second part. k=1 (row1) to row6, k=2 (row2) to row7, k=3 (row3) to row8.\n\nSo for column2:\n\nk=0: first part is 0 (not 7), second part (row5, column2 is 0) \u2192 no.\n\nk=1: first part row1, column2 is7; second part row6, column2 is0. 7 and0 \u2192 no.\n\nk=2: first part row2, column2 is7; second part row7, column2 is2 \u2192 yes. So count +=1.\n\nk=3: first part row3, column2 is7; second part row8, column2 is0 \u2192 no.\n\nSo total count is 1. But the output is 3 here. So this doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. So this approach isn't matching. Let's think differently.\n\nLooking at the output in Example0:\n\n[0,0,3,0]\n\n[3,0,0,0]\n\n[0,0,0,0]\n\n[0,0,0,0]\n\nSo the 3s are in positions (0,2), (1,0). Let's see if there's a pattern here.\n\nIn the first part (rows0-3) of the input:\n\nRow0: [7,7,0,7]\n\nRow1: [0,7,7,0]\n\nRow2: [0,7,7,7]\n\nRow3: [0,7,7,0]\n\nIn the second part (rows5-8):\n\nRow5: [0,0,0,0]\n\nRow6: [0,2,0,2]\n\nRow7: [2,2,2,0]\n\nRow8: [2,0,0,2]\n\nLooking at the first output row's (0,2) being 3. Let's see row0 in the first part, column2 is 0. Row5 in the second part, column2 is0. No 7 and 2. How does this get a 3?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 3s are placed where in the same position, there's a 7 in the first part and a 2 in the second part, but not just in the same row. Maybe across all rows. For example, the total number of 7s in the first part columns and 2s in the second part columns for that position. Let's take position (0,2) in the output. Let's check all rows in the first part's column2 and all rows in the second part's column2.\n\nFirst part column2 (across rows0-3):\n\n0,7,7,7.\n\nSecond part column2 (rows5-8):\n\n0,0,2,0.\n\nSo for each cell in column2 of first part (0,7,7,7) and second part (0,0,2,0). For each pair of cells in the same row (row0 and row5, row1 and row6, etc.), count how many times there's a 7 in the first and 2 in the second. So row2 (first part) has 7, and row7 (second part) has 2. So that's one occurrence. But the output is 3 here. So that can't be right.\n\nHmm. Maybe the 3 is the sum of all 7s in the first part and 2s in the second part across the entire column. For column2 in first part, sum is 0+7+7+7=21. Column2 in second part sum is 0+0+2+0=2. Not sure how 21 and 2 would lead to 3.\n\nAlternative approach: Maybe each 3 in the output corresponds to a cell where the sum of the corresponding cells in the first part and second part equals 9 (7+2=9). Let's check.\n\nIn Example0's output, the first 3 is at position (0,2). The first part's row0, column2 is 0. Second part's row5, column2 is 0. 0+0=0\u22609. So that's not it.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 7 in the first part and 2 in the second part in the same row and column. Let's check:\n\nLooking for cells where first part (rows0-3) has 7 and second part (rows5-8) has 2.\n\nFor example, in row0, first part cell (0,0)=7. Second part row5 cell (5,0)=0. No.\n\nrow0, first part cell (0,1)=7. second part row5 cell (5,1)=0. No.\n\nrow1, cell (1,1)=7. second part row6 cell (6,1)=2. So here, first part 7 and second part 2. So this would contribute to the output. But in which position?\n\nIf the output's position (row, column) is the same as the column in the input, but how rows are mapped. For example, row0 in the output may correspond to row1 in the first part and row6 in the second part. But this is unclear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is a 4x4 matrix where each cell (i,j) counts the number of times a 7 is present in the first part's j-th column and a 2 is present in the second part's i-th row's j-th column. Not sure.\n\nWait, let's take the output in Example0:\n\nFirst output row is [0,0,3,0]. Let's look at column2 here. The 3 is in position (0,2).\n\nIf for column2 in the first part, there are three 7s (rows1,2,3) and in the second part's column2, there's one 2 (row7). So 3*1=3. That's a possible product. So maybe for each column j in the first part, count the number of 7s, and in the second part's column j, count the number of 2s. Then multiply those two numbers, and if the product is non-zero, put it in the output's (i,j) where i is perhaps the row from the second part. But this is getting complicated.\n\nAlternatively, maybe for each column in the first part and second part, the count is the number of 7s in the first part's column multiplied by the number of 2s in the second part's column. Then, if this product is non-zero, the output's first row, column j is that product. But in Example0, first part column2 has three 7s (since rows1,2,3 have 7s), and second part column2 has one 2 (row7). So 3*1=3. That would explain the 3 in output's column2 of the first row. Similarly, in the second output row (3,0,0,0), column0. Let's see first part column0: row0 has 7, rows1-3 have 0. So count is 1. Second part column0: row5 has 0, row6 has0, row7 has2, row8 has2. So two 2s. 1*2=2, but the output is 3. Hmm, that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, sum of 7s in first part column and sum of 2s in second part column. For column0 in first part, sum is 7 (row0) + 0 +0 +0=7. Second part column0 sum is 0+0+2+2=4. 7+4=11. Not 3. Doesn't fit.\n\nWait, maybe it's the minimum of the count of 7s in the first part column and the count of 2s in the second part column. For example, in column2 of first part, there are 3 7s. In second part column2, 1 2. min(3,1)=1. Not 3.\n\nHmm. This is getting tricky. Let's look at another example.\n\nTake Example1's output:\n\n[0,3,0,0]\n\n[3,0,0,0]\n\n[3,0,0,3]\n\n[0,0,0,3]\n\nLooking at the first output row's second element (3). Let's check the first part's column1 and second part's column1.\n\nFirst part (rows0-3) column1:\n\nRow0:0, row1:0, row2:7, row3:7. So two 7s.\n\nSecond part (rows5-8) column1:\n\nRow5:0, row6:2, row7:2, row8:0. So two 2s.\n\nSo 2*2=4, which isn't 3. Or 2+2=4. Not matching.\n\nAlternative approach: Let's look at the output rows and see if they form a certain shape. For example, in Example0's output, the 3s are in positions that might form some kind of pattern. But it's not obvious.\n\nAnother angle: the fifth row in all inputs is [4,4,4,4], which could be a separator. The rows after that (rows5-8) might be processed differently. Also, the output has four rows. Let's see if each output row is generated from a combination of two rows from the input.\n\nAlternatively, the output could be a matrix where each element is 3 if the sum of the corresponding elements in the first part and second part is 9 (7+2) or something else. Let's check.\n\nIn Example0's output position (0,2) is 3. The first part row0, column2 is 0. Second part row5, column2 is 0. Sum is 0. Not 9. So that's not it.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the count of 7s in the first part and 2s in the second part in the same row and column. For example, for each position (i,j) in the output, count how many times in the first part's rows (0-3) there's a 7, and in the corresponding second part's rows (5-8) there's a 2 at the same (i,j). Wait, but rows0-3 and rows5-8 are four rows each, perhaps paired as row0 with row5, row1 with row6, etc. Then for each (i,j) in the output, count how many pairs (from the four row pairs) have 7 in the first part and 2 in the second part. The count is the value in the output.\n\nLet's test this for Example0's output.\n\nFor output row0, column2 (value3):\n\nCheck each row pair:\n\nRow0 (first part) and row5 (second part): column2 is 0 and 0 \u2192 no.\n\nRow1 (first part) and row6 (second part): column2 is7 (first part) and0 (second part) \u2192 no.\n\nRow2 (first part) and row7 (second part): column2 is7 (first) and2 (second) \u2192 yes. Count +=1.\n\nRow3 (first part) and row8 (second part): column2 is7 (first) and0 (second) \u2192 no.\n\nSo count is1, but output is3. Not matching.\n\nHmm. So this approach isn't working. Let's think of another possibility.\n\nLooking at the output, the values are only 0 and 3. So the transformation must result in either 0 or 3. Maybe 3 appears when certain conditions are met three times. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe 3 is a code for some combination. For example, 7 and 2 in the same cell across the two parts. But how would that sum to 3?\n\nWait, 7 in the first part and 2 in the second part: 7+2=9. But 9 mod something? 9 mod 6 is 3. Maybe modulo 6. So 7+2=9 \u2192 3 mod6. That's possible. Let's check other examples.\n\nIn Example1's first output row, the second element is3. Check first part and second part for that position.\n\nFirst part row0, column1 is0 (from input rows0-3). Second part row5, column1 is0. 0+0=0 mod6 is 0. Not 3.\n\nHmm, not matching.\n\nAlternative idea: The sum of the first part's cell and the second part's cell is 9 (7+2=9), then take 9 divided by 3 equals3. But this is arbitrary.\n\nAnother approach: The output is a 4x4 grid, and the input has 9 rows. The fifth row is all 4s. Maybe the first four rows and the last four rows (after the 4s) are processed in a way that their elements are subtracted or combined, and if the result is 9, then it's 3. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the number of times the first part has a 7 and the second part has a 2 in the same position, multiplied by 3. But in Example0's output, the 3s would imply one occurrence multiplied by3. But how?\n\nAlternatively, the output is 3 where there is a 7 in the first part and a 2 in the second part for the same cell, summed across the rows. For example, each such occurrence contributes 3. But that's not obvious.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by XOR-ing the first part's cell with the second part's cell. 7 in binary is 111, 2 is 010. XOR is 101 which is 5. Not 3.\n\nHmm. This is challenging. Let me look for another pattern.\n\nLooking at Example0's input:\n\nFirst part rows0-3:\n\n7,7,0,7\n\n0,7,7,0\n\n0,7,7,7\n\n0,7,7,0\n\nSecond part rows5-8:\n\n0,0,0,0\n\n0,2,0,2\n\n2,2,2,0\n\n2,0,0,2\n\nThe output is four rows. Let's see the first output row [0,0,3,0]. Maybe each output row is a combination of two input rows from the first part and second part. For example, row0 of output is first part row0 and second part row5, but how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe each output row is the sum of a first part row and a second part row. For example, first part row0 plus second part row5. Let's compute:\n\nRow0 first part:7,7,0,7.\n\nRow5 second part:0,0,0,0.\n\nSum:7,7,0,7. But output row0 is [0,0,3,0]. Doesn't match.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the number of times a 7 appears in the first part's row and a 2 appears in the second part's row for the same column. For example, for each column, count the number of rows where first part has 7 and second part has 2 in that column. \n\nFor Example0's output row0, column2:\n\nLooking at all four pairs of rows (row0 and row5, row1 and row6, row2 and row7, row3 and row8) in column2.\n\nRow0 first part:0 \u2192 not 7. So no.\n\nRow1 first part:7 (row1, column2), second part row6, column2:0 \u2192 no.\n\nRow2 first part:7 (row2, column2), second part row7, column2:2 \u2192 yes. So count +=1.\n\nRow3 first part:7 (row3, column2), second part row8, column2:0 \u2192 no.\n\nSo count is1. But output is3. So this doesn't explain.\n\nAlternative idea: Maybe the output is 3 for each column where the sum of 7s in the first part and 2s in the second part is divisible by 3. For example, sum of 7s in first part column and sum of 2s in second part column. But in Example0's column2, first part sum is21 (7+7+7=21?), second part sum is2 (0+0+2+0=2). 21+2=23, which is not divisible by3. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is 3 for each cell where the first part's cell is 7 and the second part's cell is 2, regardless of row. But how does that fit into the output matrix?\n\nWait, the output is four rows. Maybe each output row corresponds to a pair of rows from the first and second parts. For example, output row0 is row0 from first part and row5 from second part, row1 is row1 and row6, etc. Then, for each cell in the output row, if the first part's cell is7 and second part's cell is2, then output is3, else0. Let's check.\n\nExample0:\n\nOutput row0 is row0 (7,7,0,7) and row5 (0,0,0,0). So no 7 and 2 in any cell. Output row0 should be all 0s. But in the example, output row0 is [0,0,3,0]. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAnother approach: Maybe the output is the transpose of some operation between the first part and the second part. For example, multiplying the first part matrix (4x4) with the second part matrix (4x4), and the result is the output. But matrix multiplication for 4x4 and 4x4 would result in 4x4. Let's see:\n\nBut the first part is 4 rows of 4 elements each. The second part is also 4 rows of 4 elements each. So matrix multiplication is possible, but the product would be 4x4. Let's compute for Example0.\n\nFirst part (rows0-3):\n\n[\n[7,7,0,7],\n[0,7,7,0],\n[0,7,7,7],\n[0,7,7,0]\n]\n\nSecond part (rows5-8):\n\n[\n[0,0,0,0],\n[0,2,0,2],\n[2,2,2,0],\n[2,0,0,2]\n]\n\nMatrix multiplication would have each element (i,j) as the sum over k=0-3 of (first[i][k] * second[k][j]).\n\nFor example, output[0][0] = 7*0 + 7*0 +0*2 +7*2 =0+0+0+14=14. Not 3. So this doesn't explain the output.\n\nAlternative idea: The output could be the number of times a 7 is in the first part's column and a 2 is in the second part's row. For example, for each output cell (i,j), count the number of times there's a7 in column j of the first part and a2 in row i of the second part. \n\nLet's try this for Example0's output cell (0,2).\n\nColumn j=2 in first part: rows0-3, column2: 0,7,7,7.\n\nRow i=0 in the second part (rows5-8) is row5: [0,0,0,0]. This row has no 2s.\n\nSo count would be the number of 7s in column2 of first part (3) multiplied by the number of 2s in row0 of second part (0). 3*0=0. But output cell is3. So no.\n\nAnother possibility: Maybe each output row corresponds to a row in the second part, and each column corresponds to a column in the first part. For each cell (i,j), count the number of 2s in row i of the second part and 7s in column j of the first part. Multiply those two numbers. If the product is non-zero, output the product.\n\nFor Example0's output cell (0,2):\n\nRow i=0 in second part is row5: [0,0,0,0] \u2192 0 2s.\n\nColumn j=2 in first part: 0,7,7,7 \u2192 3 7s.\n\n0 *3=0. Output is3. Doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. This is really challenging. Let's look for other patterns in the outputs.\n\nIn Example0's output:\n\nThe non-zero values are 3s. They are located at (0,2), (1,0). Let's check the first part and second part for these positions.\n\nFor (0,2):\n\nFirst part row0, column2 is0. Second part row5, column2 is0. Not helpful.\n\nFor (1,0):\n\nFirst part row1, column0 is0. Second part row6, column0 is0. Not helpful.\n\nWait, maybe the output is generated based on overlapping positions where a 7 is present in the first part and a 2 is present in the second part, but not necessarily in the same row. For example, for each position (i,j) in the output, count the number of times 7 appears in the first part's column j and 2 appears in the second part's row i, then multiply those two numbers and take modulo something.\n\nFor Example0's output cell (0,2):\n\nFirst part column j=2 has 3 7s (rows1,2,3). Second part row i=0 (row5) has 0 2s. 3*0=0. Output is3. Not matching.\n\nAlternatively, sum of 7s in first part's column j and 2s in second part's row i.\n\nFor (0,2): 3 +0=3. That's the output value. For (1,0): first part column0 has 1 7 (row0), second part row1 (row6) has 2 2s (columns1 and3). Sum is1 +2=3. Output is3. This seems to fit.\n\nLet's check other cells in Example0:\n\nOutput cell (0,2) is3: first part column2 has3 7s, second part row0 (row5) has0 2s. Sum is3+0=3. Output is3.\n\nOutput cell (1,0) is3: first part column0 has1 7, second part row1 (row6) has2 2s. 1+2=3. Output is3.\n\nOther output cells are0. For example, output cell (0,0): first part column0 has1 7, second part row0 (row5) has0 2s. 1+0=1\u22603. So output is0.\n\nThis seems to fit for the non-zero values. Let's check other examples.\n\nExample1's output first row is [0,3,0,0]. The non-zero cell is (0,1) with3.\n\nFirst part column1: rows0-3 column1. Let's see:\n\nExample1's first part:\n\n[0,0,7,7]\n\n[0,0,7,7]\n\n[0,7,7,0]\n\n[7,7,0,0]\n\nSo column1 in first part:\n\nrow0:0, row1:0, row2:7, row3:7 \u2192 sum of 7s is2.\n\nSecond part row0 (row5) has [2,0,2,0]. So number of 2s in row5: 2 (columns0 and2).\n\nSum:2+2=4. But output is3. Doesn't fit.\n\nWait, maybe it's the count of 7s in the first part's column j multiplied by the count of 2s in the second part's row i. Then, if the product is 3, output3, else0.\n\nIn Example0's (0,2):3 7s *0 2s=0 \u2192 output is3. No, that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, if the product is greater than or equal to3, output3. But in Example0's (0,2) product is3*0=0. So no.\n\nAlternatively, the sum of the counts. For Example0's (0,2):3+0=3 \u2192 output3. For Example0's (1,0):1 (7s in column0) +2 (2s in row6) =3 \u2192 output3. \n\nIn Example1's output cell (0,1) is3. Let's check:\n\nFirst part column1: rows0-3 \u2192 0,0,7,7. Count of 7s is2.\n\nSecond part row0 (row5) is [2,0,2,0]. Number of 2s is2.\n\nSum:2+2=4 \u2192 output is3. Doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. So this doesn't hold.\n\nAlternative idea: Maybe the output is the count of times 7 appears in the first part's row and 2 appears in the second part's column for the same position. For example, for each cell (i,j), count how many rows in the first part have 7 in column j, and how many rows in the second part have 2 in row i, column k. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is a 4x4 matrix where each cell (i,j) represents the number of 7s in the j-th column of the first part minus the number of 2s in the i-th row of the second part. For Example0's (0,2):\n\n7s in column2 (first part) is3. 2s in row0 (second part) is0. 3-0=3 \u2192 output3. \n\nIn (1,0): 7s in column0 is1. 2s in row1 (second part) is2 (row6 has 2s in columns1 and3). 1-2 =-1. But output is3. So no.\n\nAlternatively, absolute value. 3-0=3 \u21923. 1-2=1 \u2192 absolute 1. Not matching.\n\nAnother possibility: The output cell (i,j) is 3 if there are exactly three occurrences where the first part's column j has 7 and the second part's row i has 2 in the same column. But not sure.\n\nThis is really challenging. Let's think of another approach. Maybe the output is generated by looking for the number of 2s in the second part's rows and 7s in the first part's columns, and arranging them in a certain way.\n\nLooking at the test input:\n\nTest Input:\n\n[7,7,7,7]\n\n[0,7,7,7]\n\n[7,0,0,0]\n\n[7,0,7,0]\n\n[4,4,4,4]\n\n[0,2,2,2]\n\n[0,0,0,0]\n\n[2,0,2,2]\n\n[0,2,0,0]\n\nThe first part (rows0-3):\n\nRow0:7,7,7,7\n\nRow1:0,7,7,7\n\nRow2:7,0,0,0\n\nRow3:7,0,7,0\n\nSecond part (rows5-8):\n\nRow5:0,2,2,2\n\nRow6:0,0,0,0\n\nRow7:2,0,2,2\n\nRow8:0,2,0,0\n\nAssuming the pattern is that for each output cell (i,j), the value is 3 if the number of 7s in the first part's column j plus the number of 2s in the second part's row i equals3. Let's test this for the test input.\n\nFirst, for the first part columns:\n\nColumn0: row0=7, row1=0, row2=7, row3=7 \u2192 count of 7s is3.\n\nColumn1: row0=7, row1=7, row2=0, row3=0 \u2192 count is2.\n\nColumn2: row0=7, row1=7, row2=0, row3=7 \u2192 count is3.\n\nColumn3: row0=7, row1=7, row2=0, row3=0 \u2192 count is2.\n\nFor the second part rows:\n\nRow5 (second part row0): 0,2,2,2 \u2192 number of 2s is3.\n\nRow6 (second part row1): 0,0,0,0 \u2192 0.\n\nRow7 (second part row2): 2,0,2,2 \u21923.\n\nRow8 (second part row3):0,2,0,0 \u21921.\n\nSo for output cell (i,j), sum of first part's column j (7 count) + second part's row i (2 count). If sum equals3, output3, else0.\n\nLet's compute:\n\nFor i=0 (row5):\n\nj=0:3+3=6 \u21920.\n\nj=1:2+3=5\u21920.\n\nj=2:3+3=6\u21920.\n\nj=3:2+3=5\u21920. So output row0 would be [0,0,0,0].\n\nFor i=1 (row6):\n\nsum is7 count (column j) +0.\n\nj=0:3+0=3\u21923.\n\nj=1:2+0=2\u21920.\n\nj=2:3+0=3\u21923.\n\nj=3:2+0=2\u21920. So output row1 would be [3,0,3,0]. But according to the training examples, outputs don't have multiple 3s in the same row, but in Example3's output, there are two 3s in row1. Hmm, this might fit.\n\nFor i=2 (row7):\n\nsum is column j count +3.\n\nj=0:3+3=6\u21920.\n\nj=1:2+3=5\u21920.\n\nj=2:3+3=6\u21920.\n\nj=3:2+3=5\u21920. So row2 would be [0,0,0,0].\n\nFor i=3 (row8):\n\nsum is column j count +1.\n\nj=0:3+1=4\u21920.\n\nj=1:2+1=3\u21923.\n\nj=2:3+1=4\u21920.\n\nj=3:2+1=3\u21923. So row3 would be [0,3,0,3].\n\nBut according to the training examples, outputs have varying patterns. Let's see if this matches any training example.\n\nBut wait, in Example0's output:\n\nFirst part column2 has3 7s. Second part row0 (i=0) has0 2s. Sum 3+0=3 \u2192 output3. Which matches. For row1 (i=1), second part row6 has0 2s. So j=0:3+0=3\u21923. But in Example0's output, row1's first element is3, which matches. But according to this, Example0's output row1 would have [3,0,3,0]. But the actual output is [3,0,0,0]. So this doesn't fit.\n\nSo this pattern doesn't align with the training examples. Back to the drawing board.\n\nAnother approach: Let's look at the output structure. The output is four rows, each with four elements. Maybe each output row corresponds to a row in the second part (rows5-8), and each element corresponds to a column. For each element in the output, if the corresponding position in the first part has a 7 and the same position in the second part has a 2, then output3, else0. \n\nWait, for example, in Example0's output row0 (which would correspond to row5 in the second part), column2. First part row0, column2 is0. Second part row5, column2 is0. Not matching.\n\nBut maybe the output is generated by comparing all possible pairs between the first part rows and second part rows. For example, for each cell (i,j) in the output, if there exists any pair of rows (first part row, second part row) where first part row's j-th element is7 and second part row's j-th element is2, then count the number of such pairs and output3 if the count is3. But this is getting too vague.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by flipping the first part and second part in some way. For example, first part rows are stacked horizontally with second part rows, and then some operation is done.\n\nAlternatively, think of the output as a grid where each cell is3 if the corresponding cell in the first part is7 and the corresponding cell in the second part is2, summed across rows. For example, each row in the output is the sum of 3s from the four pairs of rows (first part row0 and second part row5, etc.), but only if both are7 and2. But in Example0's output, row0 has3 in column2. Let's check:\n\nFor output row0 (corresponding to row0 in first part and row5 in second part), column2: first part is0, second part is0 \u2192 no.\n\nRow1 (first part row1 and second part row6): column2 first part7 and second part0 \u2192 no.\n\nRow2 (first part row2 and second part row7): column2 first part7 and second part2 \u2192 yes. So this contributes 3 in column2 of some row.\n\nRow3 (first part row3 and second part row8): column2 first part7 and second part0 \u2192 no.\n\nSo total count in column2 across all four pairs is1. But the output has3 here. So this doesn't fit.\n\nThis is really challenging. Let's think differently. Maybe the output is a result of some graphical transformation, like treating the first part and second part as layers and combining them. For example, where both layers have certain numbers, a3 is placed.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is a 4x4 matrix where each cell is3 if the sum of the first part's cell and the second part's cell is 9 (7+2) in at least three positions, but this seems arbitrary.\n\nAnother angle: the number 3 in the output could represent the sum of occurrences where a 7 in the first part's row and a 2 in the second part's column intersect. For example, for each cell (i,j) in the output, count the number of rows in the first part where the j-th element is7 and any row in the second part's i-th row has a2 in any position. Multiply these counts and if the product is3, output3.\n\nFor Example0's output (0,2):\n\nNumber of first part rows where column2 is7: rows1,2,3 \u21923.\n\nNumber of second part row0 (row5) where any element is2: row5 has no 2s \u21920.\n\n3 *0=0 \u2192 output0. But the actual output is3. Doesn't fit.\n\nI'm stuck. Let's try to find another pattern in the training examples.\n\nLooking at Example0's output:\n\nThe 3s are at (0,2) and (1,0). In the first part, column2 has three 7s. In the second part, row0 (row5) has no 2s, but row1 (row6) has two 2s (columns1 and3). \n\nMaybe the output's row corresponds to the second part's row, and the column corresponds to the first part's column. Then, for each cell (i,j) in the output, it's3 if the number of 7s in first part's column j multiplied by the number of 2s in second part's row i equals3. For example:\n\nExample0's output (0,2): first part columnj=2 has3 7s, second part rowi=0 has0 2s. 3*0=0 \u2192 not3.\n\nExample0's output (1,0): first part column0 has1 7, second part rowi=1 has2 2s. 1*2=2 \u2192 not3.\n\nNot helpful.\n\nAnother idea: The output is a 4x4 matrix where each cell (i,j) is3 if the first part's row i has a7 in column j and the second part's row j has a2 in column i. For example, in Example0's output (0,2):\n\nCheck first part row0, column2 is0 \u2192 no.\n\n second part row2 (row7), column0 is2. So if i=0, j=2, then second part row2 (row7) column0 is2. But first part row0 column j=2 is0. So no. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, transpose one of the matrices. For example, cell (i,j) in output is3 if first part's row i has7 in column j and second part's column i has2 in row j.\n\nThis is getting too complex. Maybe I need to look for a different pattern.\n\nLooking at the test input and trying to see what the output would be based on possible patterns.\n\nTest Input's first part:\n\nRow0:7,7,7,7\n\nRow1:0,7,7,7\n\nRow2:7,0,0,0\n\nRow3:7,0,7,0\n\nSecond part:\n\nRow5:0,2,2,2\n\nRow6:0,0,0,0\n\nRow7:2,0,2,2\n\nRow8:0,2,0,0\n\nAssuming that the output is generated by counting the number of times a 7 in the first part and a 2 in the second part are in the same column across all rows. For example, for each column j, count how many rows have 7 in first part's column j and 2 in second part's column j. Multiply the counts and use 3 if it's non-zero.\n\nFor example, in test input's column0:\n\nFirst part column0 has7 in rows0,2,3 \u21923 times.\n\nSecond part column0 has2 in row7 (row7 in input, which is second part's row2) \u21921 time.\n\n3*1=3. So output's column0 would have3 in row2 (since row7 is second part's row2) and other rows. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, for each column j, the number of 7s in first part's column j is A, the number of 2s in second part's column j is B. Output's column j in row i is3 if A*B equals3. But for column0:\n\nA=3, B=1 (row7 and row8 in second part have 2s in column0? Row7's column0 is2, row5's column0 is0. So B=1.\n\nA*B=3*1=3. So output column0 would have3 in some row. But how rows are mapped.\n\nThis is getting too time-consuming. Given the time I've spent and the lack of progress, maybe I should try to find a pattern that fits the examples and apply it to the test input.\n\nAlternative approach: Looking at the outputs, the 3s often appear in columns where the first part has many 7s and the second part has 2s in certain rows. For example, in Example0's output, column2 has3 7s in the first part and a 2 in row7 of the second part. The output cell (0,2) is3. Maybe the output is a 4x4 matrix where each cell (i,j) is3 if the number of 7s in the first part's column j is equal to the number of 2s in the second part's row i. For example, in Example0's output cell (0,2): first part columnj=2 has3 7s, second part rowi=0 (row5) has0 2s. 3\u22600. So no.\n\nBut output cell (1,0) is3: first part column0 has1 7, second part rowi=1 (row6) has0 2s. 1\u22600. Doesn't fit.\n\nAnother idea: The output is a 4x4 matrix where each cell (i,j) is3 if the sum of the j-th column in the first part and the i-th row in the second part equals a certain value. For example, sum of 7s in column j and sum of 2s in row i equals 3. In Example0's output (0,2): j=2 has3 7s, i=0 (row5) has0 2s. 3+0=3 \u21923. Output is3. \n\nIn Example0's output (1,0): j=0 has1 7s, i=1 (row6) has0 2s. Sum 1+0=1. Output is3. Doesn't fit.\n\nHmm.\n\nAt this point, given the time constraints, I'll have to make an educated guess based on the examples and apply it to the test input.\n\nLooking at the examples, each output row has 3s in positions that seem to correspond to columns with multiple 7s in the first part and rows with multiple 2s in the second part. Perhaps the output is generated by placing a 3 in cell (i,j) if the number of 7s in column j of the first part plus the number of 2s in row i of the second part equals 3.\n\nLet's test this for Example0's output:\n\nCell (0,2): columnj=2 has3 7s, rowi=0 (row5) has0 2s \u21923+0=3 \u2192 output3. Yes.\n\nCell (1,0): columnj=0 has1 7s, rowi=1 (row6) has0 2s \u21921+0=1 \u2192 output0. But Example0's output has 3 here. Doesn't fit.\n\nSo this doesn't work.\n\nAnother possibility: The output cell (i,j) is3 if the number of 7s in column j of the first part is equal to the number of 2s in row i of the second part. For Example0's cell (0,2):3 7s vs0 2s \u2192 no. Doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, the product of the counts equals3. For Example0's (0,2):3 *0=0 \u2192 no.\n\nThis is really tough. I'll have to make a guess. \n\nBased on the test input's first part columns:\n\nColumn0:3 7s (rows0,2,3)\n\nColumn1:2 7s (rows0,1)\n\nColumn2:3 7s (rows0,1,3)\n\nColumn3:2 7s (rows0,1)\n\nSecond part rows:\n\nRow5 (i=0):3 2s (columns1,2,3)\n\nRow6 (i=1):0 2s.\n\nRow7 (i=2):3 2s (columns0,2,3)\n\nRow8 (i=3):1 2 (column1)\n\nAssuming the output is 3 where the number of 7s in the first part's column j multiplied by the number of 2s in the second part's row i equals3. \n\nFor example:\n\nTest input's column0 has3 7s. Row0 has3 2s. 3*3=9 \u2192 no. But maybe if they sum to3.\n\n3+3=6 \u2192 no.\n\nAlternatively, if the product is >=3, output3.\n\nBut in Example0's (0,2):3*0=0 \u2192 output3. Doesn't fit.\n\nAnother approach: Perhaps the output is a 4x4 matrix where each cell (i,j) is3 if there are exactly three instances where a 7 is in the first part's column j and a 2 is in the second part's row i. But how?\n\nIn the test input's column0 (3 7s) and row7 (3 2s). If this leads to a 3 in the output cell where i=2 (row7) and j=0.\n\nBut I'm not confident. Given the time I've spent and the need to provide an answer, I'll proceed with this approach.\n\nFor the test input:\n\nFirst part columns:\n\n0:3 7s\n\n1:2 7s\n\n2:3 7s\n\n3:2 7s\n\nSecond part rows:\n\ni=0 (row5):3 2s\n\ni=1 (row6):0\n\ni=2 (row7):3 2s\n\ni=3 (row8):1 2.\n\nFor each cell (i,j) in the output:\n\nIf first part columnj's 7 count + second part rowi's 2 count ==3, then output3.\n\nFor test input:\n\ni=0 (3 2s):\n\nj=0:3+3=6\u2192 no.\n\nj=1:2+3=5\u2192 no.\n\nj=2:3+3=6\u2192 no.\n\nj=3:2+3=5\u2192 no.\n\ni=1 (0 2s):\n\nj=0:3+0=3\u2192 yes.\n\nj=1:2+0=2\u2192 no.\n\nj=2:3+0=3\u2192 yes.\n\nj=3:2+0=2\u2192 no.\n\nSo output row1 would be [3,0,3,0].\n\ni=2 (3 2s):\n\nj=0:3+3=6\u2192 no.\n\nj=1:2+3=5\u2192 no.\n\nj=2:3+3=6\u2192 no.\n\nj=3:2+3=5\u2192 no.\n\ni=3 (1 2):\n\nj=0:3+1=4\u2192 no.\n\nj=1:2+1=3\u2192 yes.\n\nj=2:3+1=4\u2192 no.\n\nj=3:2+1=3\u2192 yes.\n\nSo output row3 would be [0,3,0,3].\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nOutput rows:\n\nRow0: [0,0,0,0]\n\nRow1: [3,0,3,0]\n\nRow2: [0,0,0,0]\n\nRow3: [0,3,0,3]\n\nBut looking at the training examples, the outputs don't have two 3s in the same row except for Example2's third row. But this is a guess. However, the sample outputs might have such patterns.\n\nAlternatively, if the sum is exactly3, output3. For test input:\n\nRow0: sum is3+3=6, etc. So no 3s.\n\nRow1: j=0 and j2:3+0=3 \u2192 3.\n\nSo row1 would be [3,0,3,0].\n\nRow3: j1 and j3:2+1=3 \u21923.\n\nThus, the output would be:\n\n[0,0,0,0]\n\n[3,0,3,0]\n\n[0,0,0,0]\n\n[0,3,0,3]\n\nBut I'm not sure if this matches the pattern. Looking back at the training examples:\n\nIn Example3's output, the third row is [0,0,3,0], which could be where the sum of counts equals3.\n\nBut in Example1's output:\n\n[0,3,0,0]\n\n[3,0,0,0]\n\n[3,0,0,3]\n\n[0,0,0,3]\n\nFor row0, column1 is3. First part column1's 7 count is2 (rows2 and3). Second part row0's 2 count is2 (row5 has 0, row5 is part of second part's row0). So 2+2=4\u22603. So this pattern doesn't hold.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and the need to provide an answer, I'll proceed with this approach for the test input, even though it's not perfect. The final output based on this would be:\n\n[3,0,3,0]\n\n[0,3,0,3]\n\nBut the actual output requires four rows. Wait, the test output needs to be four rows. Based on the sum approach:\n\nTest output would be:\n\n[0,0,0,0]\n\n[3,0,3,0]\n\n[0,0,0,0]\n\n[0,3,0,3]\n\nBut looking at the training examples, the outputs often have 3s scattered. However, the test input's output based on this pattern would have those rows. But I'm not sure if this is correct.\n\nAlternatively, considering the test input's second part rows:\n\nRow5 (i=0):0,2,2,2 \u2192 three 2s.\n\nRow7 (i=2):2,0,2,2 \u2192 three 2s.\n\nSo columns j in first part with 3 7s are columns0 and2. So maybe the output would have 3s where second part's row has three 2s and first part's column has three 7s.\n\nFor example, output cell (0,0) and (0,2) if row0 (second part) has three 2s and columns0 and2 have three 7s. So output row0 would be [3,0,3,0].\n\nSimilarly, row2 (second part) has three 2s, so output row2 would be [3,0,3,0].\n\nBut how to arrange this into four rows. Maybe the output rows correspond to the second part's rows. So for each row in the second part (rows5-8), if the row has three 2s, then the output row has 3s in columns with three 7s. Else, zeros.\n\nFor test input:\n\nSecond part row5 (i=0) has three 2s \u2192 columns0 and2 of first part have three 7s. So output row0: [3,0,3,0].\n\nRow7 (i=2) has three 2s \u2192 same columns \u2192 output row2: [3,0,3,0].\n\nOther rows (i=1 and i=3) have less than three 2s \u2192 output rows1 and3 are all 0s.\n\nBut the output needs four rows. So the output would be:\n\n[3,0,3,0]\n\n[0,0,0,0]\n\n[3,0,3,0]\n\n[0,0,0,0]\n\nBut looking at the training examples, some outputs have non-zero values in different rows. For example, Example3's output has non-zero values in multiple rows. So this could fit.\n\nHowever, this is speculative. Given the time constraints, I'll proceed with this answer."
