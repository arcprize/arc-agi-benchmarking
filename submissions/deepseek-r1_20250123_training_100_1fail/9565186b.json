        "cot_1": "Okay, let's see. I need to figure out the pattern that transforms the input matrices into the output ones. Let me look at the training examples one by one.\n\nStarting with Example 0. The input is:\n\n[2, 2, 2]\n[2, 1, 8]\n[2, 8, 8]\n\nThe output becomes:\n\n[2, 2, 2]\n[2, 5, 5]\n[2, 5, 5]\n\nHmm, so the first row remains the same. The second row changes the middle and third elements to 5. The third row also changes the last two elements to 5. But why? Let's check the original numbers. The middle element in the second row is 1, and the third is 8. Maybe there's a sum involved? 1 + 8 is 9. Oh, but 5 is part of that? Not sure yet.\n\nLooking at Example 1. Input:\n\n[1, 1, 1]\n[8, 1, 3]\n[8, 2, 2]\n\nOutput:\n\n[1, 1, 1]\n[5, 1, 5]\n[5, 5, 5]\n\nFirst row stays the same. Second row's first and third elements become 5. The third row becomes all 5s. Original values in second row: 8,1,3. Sum is 12. Not obvious. Third row was 8,2,2. Sum 12 again. Maybe the sum is 12, so average is 4, but 5 is the output. Hmm. Maybe something else.\n\nWait, in Example 0, the middle element in the second row was 1, and it changed to 5. But the third element was 8, which also became 5. Maybe 1 and 8 are being replaced by 5, but why?\n\nIn Example 2's input:\n\n[2, 2, 2]\n[8, 8, 2]\n[2, 2, 2]\n\nOutput:\n\n[2, 2, 2]\n[5, 5, 2]\n[2, 2, 2]\n\nSo here, the second row's first two elements (8,8) become 5, but the third stays 2. So maybe any element that is not part of the first row (which is all same numbers) is replaced by 5 if it's not equal to the first row's value. Wait, first row is all 2s. So in the second row, 8 and 8 are not 2, so they become 5. The third element is 2, same as first row, so stays. Then third row is all 2s, same as first, so remains. But in Example 0, the first row is all 2s. The second row has 2,1,8. The 1 and 8 are not 2, so they become 5. The first element is 2, so it stays. That fits. Similarly, third row in example 0 has 2,8,8. The 8s become 5, the first 2 stays. But wait, example 0's third row output is [2,5,5]. So yes, the first element is 2 (same as first row's elements), so stays. The others are not, so become 5.\n\nLet's check Example 3. Input:\n\n[3, 3, 8]\n[4, 4, 4]\n[8, 1, 1]\n\nOutput:\n\n[5,5,5]\n[4,4,4]\n[5,5,5]\n\nFirst row was [3,3,8]. The first two are 3, third is 8. But output is all 5s. Wait, according to previous logic, the first row might not be the reference here. Because in other examples, the first row was all same numbers. Here, the first row is [3,3,8], which isn't all the same. So maybe the rule is different. Let me re-examine.\n\nWait, Example 3's output for the first row is all 5s. The input first row has two 3s and an 8. So perhaps when a row isn't all the same, we turn those differing elements into 5s? But then the entire row becomes 5s. Alternatively, maybe there's another pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that for each row except the middle one (since in example 3, the middle row is [4,4,4] which stays the same), but the first and third rows are transformed into all 5s. But in example 0, the first row is unchanged, but the middle row is modified. Hmm, perhaps that's not the case.\n\nWait, looking again at example 3's input. The middle row is all 4s. The output's middle row remains the same. The first and third rows become all 5s. So perhaps the rule is: any row that is not all the same as the middle row's value is turned into 5s. Wait, but in example 0, the middle row after transformation is [2,5,5]. The middle row's first element is 2. The first row is all 2s, which matches, so remains. The third row's first element is 2, which matches the middle row's first element, but the other elements are 5s. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the middle row is the key. Let me check:\n\nIn example 0, the middle row in the output is [2,5,5]. The middle element of the input's middle row was 1, and the third element 8. So maybe, for the middle row, elements that are not equal to the first row's value (2) are changed to 5, while elements that match stay. Then the first row remains as is, and the third row's elements that don't match the first row's value become 5. But in example 0, the third row is [2,8,8], which in output becomes [2,5,5]. So the first element is 2 (matches first row's value), so stays, others become 5. Similarly, in example 1's input, first row is all 1s. Middle row input is [8,1,3]. So elements not 1 are 8 and 3, which become 5. So output becomes [5,1,5]. Third row input is [8,2,2]. The elements not 1 (all of them) become 5, so all 5s. That fits. \n\nIn example 2, the first row is all 2s. Middle row input is [8,8,2]. The elements not 2 are 8 and 8, so they become 5. So output is [5,5,2]. Third row is all 2s, so remains. \n\nNow example 3: The first row is [3,3,8]. The middle row is [4,4,4], which is all 4s. Wait, but according to previous pattern, the first row's elements would be compared to the middle row's value (4) in the input. If elements in first and third rows don't match the middle row's value, they are changed to 5. So in example 3's input:\n\nMiddle row is [4,4,4], so the value is 4. The first row has 3,3,8. All not 4, so all become 5. Third row is [8,1,1], all not 4, so all become 5. Hence output rows are all 5s. That fits.\n\nSo the pattern seems to be:\n\n1. The middle row of the input is the reference. If the middle row's elements are all the same (like in example 3, middle row is all 4s), then that value is the reference. For all other rows (first and third), any element that does not equal this reference value is changed to 5. But wait, in example 0, the middle row in input is [2,1,8], which is not all the same. So how does that fit?\n\nWait, maybe the reference is determined by the first element of the middle row. Let's check:\n\nIn example 0's middle row input is [2,1,8]. The first element is 2. So the reference value is 2. Then, for all elements in the first, middle, and third rows, if they are equal to 2, they stay; else, change to 5. But in example 0, the output's middle row is [2,5,5]. The first element is 2 (matches), the rest 5. The third row becomes [2,5,5]. The first element matches, others become 5. That works. The first row is all 2s, so remains. \n\nIn example 1's input, the middle row is [8,1,3]. The first element is 8, so reference is 8. Then, all elements not 8 should become 5. But the output's middle row is [5,1,5]. Wait, but 1 is not 8, so why is it 1? That contradicts. Hmm. So maybe that's not the pattern.\n\nWait example 1's input:\n\nFirst row: all 1s.\n\nMiddle row input: [8,1,3]\n\nThird row: [8,2,2]\n\nOutput:\n\nFirst row remains [1,1,1].\n\nMiddle row becomes [5,1,5].\n\nThird row becomes all 5s.\n\nBut according to previous logic, if the reference is the middle row's first element (8), then elements not 8 would become 5. So middle row would be [8 \u2192 5? No. Wait, original middle row is [8,1,3]. If reference is 8, then first element is 8, stays. 1 and 3 become 5. But output is [5,1,5]. Hmm, that doesn't fit. So maybe that's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the reference is the value of the first row's elements. Because in example 0, the first row is all 2s. Then, any element in the other rows that is not 2 becomes 5. So in example 0's middle row input: [2,1,8]. The first element is 2 (matches first row), so stays. 1 and 8 become 5. Third row [2,8,8] \u2192 2 stays, 8s become 5. Which matches the output. \n\nIn example 1, first row is all 1s. Middle row input: [8,1,3]. So elements not 1 become 5. So 8 becomes 5, 1 stays, 3 becomes 5. So output [5,1,5]. Third row input: [8,2,2]. All elements not 1, so become 5. So [5,5,5]. Which matches. \n\nIn example 2: first row is all 2s. Middle row input: [8,8,2]. Elements not 2 become 5. So 8,8 \u21925, 2 stays. Output [5,5,2]. Third row is all 2s, so remains. \n\nIn example 3: first row is [3,3,8]. Not all the same. So perhaps the reference isn't the first row? Because previous examples had the first row all the same. So perhaps when the first row is all the same, that's the reference. Otherwise, the reference is the middle row's elements. \n\nWait example 3's input first row is [3,3,8], not all same. Middle row is [4,4,4]. Third row is [8,1,1]. Output is all 5s for first and third rows. Middle row remains. So maybe the rule is: if the first row is all same, then that's the reference. Otherwise, use the middle row's all same value as reference. If neither, then perhaps something else. \n\nIn example 3, the middle row is all 4s, so reference is 4. Then first and third rows' elements not 4 are turned to 5. First row has 3,3,8 \u2192 all not 4 \u2192 become 5. Third row 8,1,1 \u2192 all not 4 \u2192 become 5. So output first and third rows are all 5s. Middle row is 4s, so remains. That fits. \n\nSo the pattern could be:\n\n- If the middle row consists of all the same elements (like in example 3), then that value is the reference. For all other rows (first and third), replace any element that is not equal to this reference value with 5.\n\n- If the middle row isn't all the same, then check if the first row is all the same. If yes, that value is the reference. Replace elements in other rows (middle and third) that are not equal to the reference with 5.\n\nWait, but in example 0, the first row is all 2s. Middle row is [2,1,8]. So first row is the reference (2). So in the middle row, elements not 2 become 5. So middle row becomes [2,5,5]. Third row [2,8,8] \u2192 elements not 2 become 5 \u2192 [2,5,5]. Which is correct.\n\nSimilarly, example 1: first row is all 1s. Middle row [8,1,3] \u2192 elements not 1 become 5 \u2192 [5,1,5]. Third row [8,2,2] \u2192 elements not 1 become 5 \u2192 all 5s. Correct.\n\nExample 2: first row all 2s. Middle row [8,8,2]. Elements not 2 \u2192 8 and 8 become 5. So [5,5,2]. Third row is all 2s \u2192 stays. Correct.\n\nExample 3: middle row is all 4s. So reference is 4. First row elements not 4 \u2192 3,3,8 \u2192 all become 5. Third row elements not 4 \u2192 8,1,1 \u2192 all 5. Correct.\n\nSo the pattern seems to be:\n\n1. Check if the middle row has all elements the same. If yes, use that value as the reference.\n\n2. If the middle row isn't all the same, check if the first row is all the same. If yes, use that as the reference.\n\n3. Then, for all rows except the reference row (if the reference is the first row), replace elements not equal to the reference value with 5. Wait, no. For example, when the reference is the first row (all same), then the middle and third rows' elements are compared to that reference. Any element not equal is replaced by 5. The first row remains as is.\n\nWhen the reference is the middle row's value (when middle row is all same), then the first and third rows' elements are compared to the reference, and elements not equal are replaced by 5. The middle row remains as is.\n\nSo applying this to the test input:\n\nTest input:\n\n[1, 3, 2]\n[3, 3, 2]\n[1, 3, 2]\n\nFirst, check the middle row [3,3,2]. Are all elements the same? No. So check if the first row is all same. The first row is [1,3,2]. Not all same. So then what? The previous examples didn't cover this case. All training examples had either the first row all same or the middle row all same.\n\nSo the training examples may have a pattern where if neither the first nor the middle row is all same, perhaps the reference is determined another way, but since there are no such examples, maybe the test case must fall into one of the previous scenarios.\n\nWait, looking at the test input:\n\nFirst row: [1,3,2] \u2192 not all same.\n\nMiddle row: [3,3,2] \u2192 not all same.\n\nThird row: [1,3,2] \u2192 not same.\n\nSo according to the previous pattern, since neither the first nor the middle row is all same, how do we proceed? But there's no training example for this. Maybe there's another rule I'm missing.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the reference is determined by the middle element of the middle row. Let's check the training examples:\n\nIn example 0, middle row input is [2,1,8]. Middle element is 1. But the reference was 2 (from first row). So perhaps not.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the reference is the value that appears most in the middle row. For test input's middle row is [3,3,2]. The value 3 appears twice. So majority is 3. Maybe use 3 as reference.\n\nIf the reference is 3, then all elements not 3 in other rows become 5. Let's see.\n\nTest input:\n\nOriginal input:\n\nRow 0: [1,3,2]\n\nRow 1: [3,3,2]\n\nRow 2: [1,3,2]\n\nIf reference is 3 (since middle row has two 3s?), then:\n\nRow 0: 1 \u21925, 3\u21923, 2\u21925 \u2192 [5,3,5]\n\nRow 1: elements are 3,3,2. Since reference is 3, 2 becomes 5 \u2192 [3,3,5]\n\nRow 2: 1\u21925, 3\u21923, 2\u21925 \u2192 [5,3,5]\n\nBut this doesn't match the training examples' pattern. Let's see if this is possible. But the previous examples didn't use this logic. So maybe this is not the case.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the reference is taken from the first element of the middle row. In the test input, the middle row is [3,3,2]. First element is 3. So reference is 3. Then:\n\nFor rows other than the middle row (rows 0 and 2), elements not 3 become 5. Middle row elements not 3 become 5. Let's see:\n\nRow 0: [1,3,2] \u2192 elements not 3 \u2192 1 and 2 become 5 \u2192 [5,3,5]\n\nRow 1: [3,3,2] \u2192 2 becomes 5 \u2192 [3,3,5]\n\nRow 2: [1,3,2] \u2192 same as row 0 \u2192 [5,3,5]\n\nBut in the training examples, the middle row in example 0 had first element 2 (same as first row's reference), so in that case, elements not 2 became 5. So maybe this approach holds.\n\nBut according to the previous examples, when the first row is all same, it's the reference. If not, check if middle row is all same. If not, perhaps use the first element of the middle row. But in example 3, the middle row is all same (4s). So the reference is 4.\n\nIn example 1, middle row is [8,1,3]. First element is 8. But the reference was the first row's 1. So no. So that can't be. So that approach is invalid.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the reference is the value that appears in all three positions of either the first row or the middle row. For the test input, neither row is all same. So perhaps the rule is to leave all as is? But the output examples never have unchanged rows except the first when it's the reference. So perhaps in such cases, all elements are turned to 5. But the test input's output would then be all 5s. But looking at the test input, perhaps there's a different pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the reference is determined by the majority in the middle row. In test input's middle row, two 3s and one 2. So reference is 3. Then, any elements in first and third rows not 3 become 5. Middle row elements not 3 become 5. So:\n\nRow0: [5,3,5]\n\nRow1: [3,3,5]\n\nRow2: [5,3,5]\n\nBut according to training examples, the middle row's elements that are not the reference are changed. For example, in example 0, the middle row's elements not 2 (the first row's reference) were changed to 5. So if the reference is determined by the majority in the middle row, then test case's middle row would have reference 3. But the output would have rows 0 and 2's elements not 3 replaced by 5, and middle row's elements not 3 (the 2) replaced by 5.\n\nBut I'm not sure. This is a possible pattern, but it's not covered in the training examples, so I'm not certain. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps when neither the first nor the middle row is uniform, then all elements become 5. But that doesn't fit the test case's possible output.\n\nWait, looking back at example 3's input:\n\nFirst row is [3,3,8], not uniform. Middle row is [4,4,4], so reference is 4. Thus, first and third rows' elements not 4 become 5. So in the test case, if the middle row isn't uniform, but the first row isn't uniform either, maybe there's no reference, so all elements become 5. But that would make the test output all 5s. But is there a case where that happens? None of the training examples show that. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the pattern is that in each row, if the element is the same as the middle element of that row, it stays, otherwise becomes 5. Let's check:\n\nIn example 0's input:\n\nRow 0: [2,2,2]. Middle element is 2. All same, so stay.\n\nRow 1: [2,1,8]. Middle element is 1. So elements that are 1 stay. 2 and 8 become 5. But output row1 is [2,5,5]. Wait, the middle element is 1. So in row1, elements not 1 become 5. So 2 becomes 5, 8 becomes 5. But output's row1 is [2,5,5]. Original row1's first element is 2, which is not 1 (middle element), so should become 5, but in output it's 2. That contradicts. So this can't be the pattern.\n\nHmm. This is tricky. Let me try to think differently.\n\nLooking at the outputs, the 5s seem to replace certain elements. In examples where a row is uniform (like the first row in example 0,1,2, and middle row in example3), those rows stay. The other rows have elements replaced by 5 if they don't match the reference value.\n\nThe reference value is determined by the first uniform row (either first or middle). So:\n\n- Check if the first row is uniform. If yes, reference is that value.\n\n- If not, check if the middle row is uniform. If yes, reference is that value.\n\n- For all elements in the first and third rows (and middle row if first row was the reference), replace any element not equal to reference with 5.\n\nIn the test input:\n\nFirst row: [1,3,2] \u2192 not uniform.\n\nMiddle row: [3,3,2] \u2192 not uniform.\n\nThird row: [1,3,2] \u2192 not uniform.\n\nSo neither the first nor the middle row is uniform. According to the training examples, there's no such case. So perhaps the pattern is different. Or maybe there's another layer to the pattern.\n\nWait, looking at example3's input, the middle row is uniform (4,4,4). So reference is 4. First and third rows' elements not 4 are replaced with 5. Now, in the test input, perhaps the middle row is [3,3,2]. Not uniform. So check the first row. It's [1,3,2]. Not uniform. So no reference. So what happens then? Maybe the entire matrix is turned into 5s except the middle row. But there's no example for that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the reference is taken from the middle element of the middle row. Let's try that.\n\nIn example0:\n\nMiddle row input: [2,1,8]. Middle element is 1. Reference would be 1. Then elements not 1 become 5. So row0: [2,2,2] \u2192 all not 1, would become 5s. But output row0 is unchanged. So this can't be.\n\nIn example1:\n\nMiddle row input: [8,1,3]. Middle element is 1. Reference is 1. So elements not 1 become 5. So row0 [1,1,1] stays. row1 [8,1,3] becomes [5,1,5]. row2 [8,2,2] becomes [5,5,5]. Which matches example1's output. So maybe this is the pattern.\n\nIn example0:\n\nMiddle element of middle row is 1. So reference is 1. row0's elements are 2s. All not 1, so should become 5. But output row0 is unchanged. So this contradicts. So this can't be the pattern.\n\nHmm. So maybe the reference is determined by the majority in the middle row. For example, in test input's middle row [3,3,2], the majority is 3. So reference is 3. Then elements not 3 become 5.\n\nSo rows:\n\nRow0: [1,3,2] \u2192 elements not 3 are 1 and 2 \u2192 become 5. So [5,3,5].\n\nRow1: [3,3,2] \u2192 2 becomes 5 \u2192 [3,3,5].\n\nRow2: [1,3,2] \u2192 [5,3,5].\n\nBut in training example1, middle row's middle element is 1. The reference was 1. So elements not 1 became 5. Which matches. In example0, middle element is 1, but reference was 2 (first row's value). So that approach doesn't fit example0.\n\nSo perhaps the reference is determined by the first row if it's uniform, else the middle element of the middle row.\n\nIn example0: first row is uniform (2), so reference is 2. Middle row elements not 2 become 5.\n\nIn example1: first row is uniform (1), reference is 1. Middle row elements not 1 become 5.\n\nIn example3: first row isn't uniform, so reference is middle row's middle element. Middle row is [4,4,4], middle element 4. So reference is 4. Elements not 4 become 5.\n\nIn test case: first row isn't uniform. Middle row isn't uniform. Middle element of middle row is 3. So reference is 3. Then:\n\nRow0: elements not 3 become 5 \u2192 [5,3,5].\n\nRow1: elements not 3 \u2192 2 \u2192 becomes 5 \u2192 [3,3,5].\n\nRow2: elements not 3 \u2192 1 and 2 \u2192 become 5 \u2192 [5,3,5].\n\nBut the training examples don't cover this scenario, so this is a guess. But does this fit any of the examples?\n\nExample3: middle row is uniform, so reference is 4. So first and third rows' elements not 4 become 5. Which is correct.\n\nExample2: first row is uniform (2), so reference is 2. Middle row elements not 2 become 5. Third row is all 2s, so remains.\n\nExample1: first row is uniform (1), reference is 1. Middle row elements not 1 become 5. Third row elements not 1 become 5.\n\nExample0: same as example1.\n\nSo if this is the case, the test input's output would be:\n\n[5,3,5]\n\n[3,3,5]\n\n[5,3,5]\n\nBut looking at the training examples, the outputs are all in the same structure, with the middle row sometimes having the reference in some positions. But let's check if this fits the test case.\n\nBut I'm not sure. This is a possible pattern but requires assuming that when the first row is not uniform, the reference is the middle element of the middle row. Since the training examples don't have this case, it's a stretch, but perhaps the intended pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the test case's input has a uniform third row? The third row is [1,3,2], which is not uniform. So no.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the reference is determined by the first element of the first row. For example, in test input, first row's first element is 1. So reference is 1. Then:\n\nRow0: elements not 1 become 5 \u2192 [1,5,5].\n\nRow1: elements not 1 become 5 \u2192 [5,5,5].\n\nRow2: elements not 1 become 5 \u2192 [1,5,5].\n\nBut this doesn't match any training examples. For instance, example0's first element is 2. So reference is 2. Middle row elements not 2 become 5. Which fits.\n\nExample1's first element is 1. So reference is 1. Which fits.\n\nExample3's first element is 3, but since the first row isn't uniform, the reference is the middle row's 4.\n\nSo if the reference is the first element of the first row if the first row is uniform, else the middle row's middle element if the middle row is uniform, else the middle element of the middle row.\n\nBut this is getting complicated. However, given the test case, perhaps applying the first element of the first row as reference since in the test case, even though the first row isn't uniform, perhaps the pattern is to take the first element of the first row as reference.\n\nBut in example3's first row isn't uniform, so reference was middle row's 4.\n\nSo perhaps the correct pattern is:\n\nThe reference is the first element of the first row if the first row is uniform. Otherwise, the reference is the middle row's value if the middle row is uniform. Otherwise, the reference is the middle element of the middle row.\n\nBut this is a hypothesis. Applying this to test input:\n\nFirst row isn't uniform. Middle row isn't uniform. So reference is middle element of middle row, which is 3.\n\nSo replace all elements not 3 with 5.\n\nThus:\n\nRow0: [1,3,2] \u2192 [5,3,5]\n\nRow1: [3,3,2] \u2192 [3,3,5]\n\nRow2: [1,3,2] \u2192 [5,3,5]\n\nBut I need to see if this fits any training example. For example, in example3:\n\nMiddle row's middle element is 4. So reference is 4. Replace elements not 4 with 5. Which is correct.\n\nIn example1:\n\nMiddle row's middle element is 1. But first row is uniform (1), so reference is 1. Correct.\n\nIn example0:\n\nFirst row is uniform, reference is 2. Middle row's elements not 2 become 5. Correct.\n\nSo yes, this seems to fit. Therefore, the pattern is:\n\n- If the first row is uniform, reference is its value.\n\n- Else, if the middle row is uniform, reference is its value.\n\n- Else, reference is the middle element of the middle row.\n\n- Replace any element in all rows (except the reference row if the reference is first or middle row's uniform) not equal to the reference value with 5.\n\nApplying this to the test input:\n\nFirst row isn't uniform. Middle row isn't uniform. So reference is middle element of middle row, which is 3.\n\nSo all elements in all rows not equal to 3 become 5.\n\nBut wait, in example3, the middle row is uniform. So reference is its value. Then, first and third rows' elements are checked. But what about the middle row? If the reference is from the middle row's value (all 4s), then middle row remains. So in the test case, since the reference is 3 (middle element of middle row), all elements not 3 in all rows become 5. Including the middle row.\n\nSo test input's rows:\n\nRow0: [1,3,2] \u2192 1 and 2 not 3 \u2192 5 \u2192 [5,3,5].\n\nRow1: [3,3,2] \u2192 2 \u2192 5 \u2192 [3,3,5].\n\nRow2: [1,3,2] \u2192 same as row0 \u2192 [5,3,5].\n\nBut looking at the training examples, when the reference is from the first row (which is uniform), the first row remains, and middle and third rows are modified. When reference is from the middle row (uniform), middle row remains, others are modified. When reference is middle element of middle row (not uniform), then all rows are modified, replacing elements not equal to reference.\n\nBut in example3's output, the middle row (which is uniform) remains. So when the reference is the middle row's value (uniform), the middle row remains, others are modified. \n\nIn the test case, since the reference is 3 (middle element of middle row), all elements not 3 in all rows are replaced, including the middle row. So middle row's last element (2) becomes 5. \n\nSo the test output would be:\n\n[5,3,5]\n\n[3,3,5]\n\n[5,3,5]\n\nBut I need to verify if this matches the structure of the training outputs. Let's look at example1's output:\n\n[1,1,1]\n\n[5,1,5]\n\n[5,5,5]\n\nFirst row stays, middle row's elements not 1 become 5. Third row all 5s.\n\nIn example3's output, middle row stays, others are all 5s.\n\nIn test case, according to this pattern, middle row's elements not 3 (which is the last element 2) becomes 5. So the middle row becomes [3,3,5]. The first and third rows are [5,3,5].\n\nThus, the final answer would be:\n\n[5,3,5]\n\n[3,3,5]\n\n[5,3,5]\n\nBut I need to check if this aligns with the given examples. For instance, example2's input:\n\nInput:\n\n[2,2,2]\n\n[8,8,2]\n\n[2,2,2]\n\nOutput:\n\n[2,2,2]\n\n[5,5,2]\n\n[2,2,2]\n\nHere, reference is first row's 2. Middle row's elements not 2 (8,8) become 5. Third row remains.\n\nSo yes, the pattern holds.\n\nSo applying to the test input, the output should be:\n\n[5,3,5]\n\n[3,3,5]\n\n[5,3,5]\n\nBut the test input's first and third rows are [1,3,2] and [1,3,2], which after transformation become [5,3,5] each. Middle row becomes [3,3,5].\n\nBut let's see if there's a different way. Maybe the reference is the value that appears most in the entire matrix. For the test input, the elements are:\n\nRow0: 1,3,2\n\nRow1:3,3,2\n\nRow2:1,3,2\n\nCounting: 1 appears 2 times, 3 appears 5 times (row0:1, row1:2, row2:1 \u2192 total 3+1=4?), wait:\n\nRow0 has 1,3,2 \u2192 1,3,2.\n\nRow1:3,3,2 \u2192 3,3,2.\n\nRow2:1,3,2 \u21921,3,2.\n\nTotal counts:\n\n1: 2 times (row0, row2).\n\n3: row0:1, row1:2, row2:1 \u2192 total 4 times.\n\n2: row0:1, row1:1, row2:1 \u2192 3 times.\n\nSo most frequent is 3. So reference is 3. Replace elements not 3 with 5.\n\nWhich gives the same result as before: [5,3,5], [3,3,5], [5,3,5].\n\nBut this approach wasn't used in the training examples. For example, in example0, the most frequent element is 2 (appears 5 times: first row 3, middle row 1, third row 3 \u2192 total 3+1+3=7?), but perhaps I'm miscalculating.\n\nExample0's input:\n\n[2,2,2]\n\n[2,1,8]\n\n[2,8,8]\n\nCounts: 2 appears 5 times (first row 3, second row 1, third row 1 \u2192 total 5). 1 appears once, 8 appears 3 times. So most frequent is 2. Which aligns with the reference being 2.\n\nIn example1's input, most frequent is 1 (first row 3, second row 1, third row 0 \u2192 total 4?), but I think this is not the case.\n\nBut maybe this is a valid approach, but I'm not sure. However, given the training examples, the pattern of using the first row if uniform, else middle row if uniform, else middle element of middle row seems plausible.\n\nTherefore, the test output would be as described.",

        "cot_2": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. So, looking at the training examples, each input is a 3x3 grid of numbers, and the output is another grid. I need to see what transformation is applied to each input to get the output.\n\nStarting with Example 0:\n\nInput:\n[2, 2, 2]\n[2, 1, 8]\n[2, 8, 8]\n\nOutput:\n[2, 2, 2]\n[2, 5, 5]\n[2, 5, 5]\n\nHmm. The first row stays the same. The second row changes the 1 and 8 to 5s. The third row also changes both 8s to 5s. Wait, but the second row's middle element was 1, now 5. So maybe there's a rule about certain numbers being replaced by 5s when they are adjacent to others?\n\nLooking at Example 1:\n\nInput:\n[1, 1, 1]\n[8, 1, 3]\n[8, 2, 2]\n\nOutput:\n[1, 1, 1]\n[5, 1, 5]\n[5, 5, 5]\n\nThe first row remains. The second row's first and third elements (8 and 3) become 5s, but the middle 1 stays. The third row's 8 and 2s become 5s. So maybe numbers that are not part of a contiguous block (like the first row's all 1s) get replaced by 5s. Wait, in example 0, the first row is all 2s and remains, but the other rows have elements that are not part of the main contiguous group. Or perhaps it's about whether the cell is part of the largest cluster of the same number.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that any cell that is part of the largest contiguous region (by value) remains, and others are replaced with 5. Let's check.\n\nIn example 0, the input has a lot of 2s. The first row is all 2s, the second row starts with 2, then 1 and 8. The third row has 2 followed by 8s. The output's first row remains 2s. The second row's first 2 stays, but the 1 and 8 become 5. Third row's 2 stays, others become 5. Wait, but in the third row of input, the first element is 2, but the output third row's first element is 2, but the others are 5. So maybe each row is treated separately? Or the entire grid is considered.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the largest connected region (same number, connected adjacently) stays, and others become 5. Let's see.\n\nIn Example 0, the input has a lot of 2s. Let's see how they are connected. The first row is all 2s. The second row starts with 2 (connected to the first row's 2), then 1, 8. Third row starts with 2 (connected to the second row's first 2), then 8s. So the largest connected region of 2s would be the first column and first row. The other 2 in the third row's first element is connected. So all the 2s in the first column and first row are part of the largest region, maybe. Then the other cells (1, 8, etc.) become 5. But the output shows that the 2s in the first row, first column, and the 2 in the second row's first element stay, while the others become 5. So perhaps the cells that are part of the largest connected component (by value) remain as is, and all other cells become 5. Let's check other examples.\n\nTake Example 1:\n\nInput is all 1s in the first row, then 8,1,3 in second, 8,2,2 in third. The output first row remains 1s. Second row becomes 5,1,5. Third becomes 5s. So maybe the largest connected component is the first row's 1s. Then any cell that is part of that component remains, others become 5. But in the second row, the 1 is connected to the first row's 1s (since they're adjacent vertically), so that 1 remains. The other cells (8,3) become 5. The third row's 8 and 2s are not part of the largest component, so they become 5. That fits.\n\nExample 2's input is:\n\n[2,2,2]\n[8,8,2]\n[2,2,2]\n\nOutput:\n[2,2,2]\n[5,5,2]\n[2,2,2]\n\nHere, the first row is all 2s. The second row starts with 8,8, then 2. The third row is all 2s. The largest connected component of 2s would be the first and third rows, connected via the third row's 2 in the second row's third element. So all the 2s except the 8s are part of the largest component, so they stay. The 8s become 5. So the output is as shown.\n\nExample3:\n\nInput:\n[3,3,8]\n[4,4,4]\n[8,1,1]\n\nOutput:\n[5,5,5]\n[4,4,4]\n[5,5,5]\n\nHere, the middle row is all 4s. The other rows have 3,3,8 and 8,1,1. The largest connected component is the middle row's 4s. So all 4s stay, others become 5. So output is 5s except middle row.\n\nSo the pattern seems to be: identify the largest contiguous region (connected cells with the same number) in the grid. Then, all cells that are part of that region remain the same, and all other cells are changed to 5. If there are multiple regions of the same maximum size, perhaps the one with the highest value or some other tiebreaker, but in the examples given, the largest is unique.\n\nWait, in example3, the input's first row is [3,3,8], second is [4,4,4], third [8,1,1]. The middle row's 4s form a contiguous region of 3 cells. The first row has two 3s connected, then 8. The third row has two 1s connected. So the largest region is the middle row's 4s (size 3). So all other cells become 5. Which matches the output.\n\nSo the process is:\n\n1. For each cell in the input grid, determine which cells are part of the largest connected region (same number, connected orthogonally, maybe not diagonally). If multiple regions have the same maximum size, perhaps the first encountered or the highest value, but the examples don't show that. Let's assume the largest in size.\n\n2. All cells in that largest region remain the same. All other cells are set to 5.\n\nNow, applying this to the test input.\n\nTest Input:\n\n[1,3,2]\n[3,3,2]\n[1,3,2]\n\nWe need to find the largest connected region.\n\nLooking at the grid:\n\nRow 0: 1,3,2\n\nRow 1:3,3,2\n\nRow 2:1,3,2\n\nLet's list the numbers and their connected regions.\n\nNumber 1: There are two 1s at (0,0) and (2,0). Are they connected? They are in the same column but separated by a row of 3s. So each is a separate region of size 1.\n\nNumber 3: Let's see. The 3s at (0,1), (1,0), (1,1), (1,2), (2,1). Wait, in row 0, column1 is 3. In row1, columns0,1,2 are 3,3,2 (no, row1, column2 is 2). Wait, row1 has 3,3,2. So the 3s in row1 are at (1,0) and (1,1). Then in row2, column1 is 3. So let's see:\n\n(0,1) is 3. Adjacent to it is (1,1) which is 3. So those are connected. Then (1,0) is 3, connected to (1,1). So the 3s form a region that includes (0,1), (1,0), (1,1), (1,2)? Wait, no, (1,2) is 2, so row1's third element is 2. Wait, original test input is:\n\nRow0: 1,3,2\n\nRow1:3,3,2\n\nRow2:1,3,2\n\nSo row0: [1][3][2]\n\nrow1: [3][3][2]\n\nrow2: [1][3][2]\n\nSo for number 3:\n\nLooking for connected regions. The 3 at (0,1) is adjacent to (1,1) (down). (1,1) is adjacent to (1,0) (left) and (2,1) (down). (1,0) is adjacent to (0,0) which is 1, so no. So the regions:\n\n- (0,1) connects to (1,1) which connects to (2,1). Also, (1,0) is 3 and adjacent to (1,1), so that's part of the same region. Wait, (1,0) is connected to (1,1), which is connected to (0,1) and (2,1). So the entire region is:\n\n(0,1), (1,0), (1,1), (2,1). So four cells. Are there other 3s? No. So the region size is 4.\n\nNumber 2: The 2s are at (0,2), (1,2), (2,2). Are they connected? (0,2) is adjacent to (1,2) (down). (1,2) is adjacent to (2,2). So that's a region of size 3.\n\nSo the largest regions are the 3s with size 4 and the 2s with size 3. So the 3s' region is the largest. Therefore, all cells in that region (the four 3s) stay, and others become 5.\n\nWait, but the 3s' region includes (0,1), (1,0), (1,1), (2,1). So:\n\nOriginal grid:\n\nRow0: 1,3,2 \u2192 (0,0) is 1 (not part of region), (0,1) is 3 (part), (0,2) is 2.\n\nRow1:3,3,2 \u2192 (1,0) is 3 (part), (1,1) is 3 (part), (1,2) is 2.\n\nRow2:1,3,2 \u2192 (2,0) is 1, (2,1) is 3 (part), (2,2) is 2.\n\nSo the cells that are part of the largest region are (0,1), (1,0), (1,1), (2,1). All other cells become 5.\n\nSo the output would be:\n\nRow0: 5 (since (0,0) is 1 not in region), 3 (part of region), 5 (2 not in region)\n\nRow1:3 (part), 3 (part), 5 (2 not in region)\n\nRow2:5 (1 not in region), 3 (part),5 (2 not in region)\n\nWait, but (1,2) is 2, which is part of the 2's region (size 3). But since the largest region is size 4 (the 3s), only the 3s' region is kept. All others become 5.\n\nSo the output grid would be:\n\n[5, 3,5]\n\n[3,3,5]\n\n[5,3,5]\n\nBut let's check the training examples to see if this matches the format.\n\nBut wait, in example 0, the 2's in the third row's first element are part of the largest region. So they stay. The 8s in third row become 5.\n\nIn the test case, the output should have:\n\nFirst row: [5,3,5]\n\nSecond row: [3,3,5]\n\nThird row: [5,3,5]\n\nBut let me check if this is correct.\n\nWait, the 3's region includes (0,1), (1,0), (1,1), (2,1). So those positions remain 3. All other cells become 5. So the output grid is:\n\nRow0: [1 becomes 5, 3 stays, 2 becomes 5 \u2192 5,3,5]\n\nRow1: [3 stays, 3 stays, 2 becomes 5 \u2192 3,3,5]\n\nRow2: [1 becomes 5, 3 stays, 2 becomes 5 \u21925,3,5]\n\nSo the output would be:\n\n[5,3,5]\n\n[3,3,5]\n\n[5,3,5]\n\nBut looking at the training examples, in example1, the output's middle row has [5,1,5], which is the original 1 in the middle. So if the 1 is part of the largest region, which in that case was the first row's 1s. Wait, in example1, the first row's 1s are a region of size 3, connected to the middle 1 in the second row (row1, column1). So the largest region is those 4 1s? Let's see:\n\nIn example1's input:\n\nRow0: [1,1,1]\n\nRow1: [8,1,3]\n\nRow2: [8,2,2]\n\nThe 1s in row0 are connected. The 1 in row1, column1 is adjacent to row0's middle 1. So that 1 is part of the same region. So total size is 4 (three from row0, plus row1's middle 1). Then the 2s in row2 are two. So the largest region is 1s (size 4). So all 1s in the region are kept. The output in example1's row1 is [5,1,5], meaning that the 8 and 3 are replaced by 5s, and the 1 remains. So that fits.\n\nSo in the test case, the largest region is the 3s with size 4. So the output should be:\n\nFirst row: 5,3,5\n\nSecond row:3,3,5\n\nThird row:5,3,5\n\nWhich is the transformed grid. Let's see if that's possible. So the answer should be:\n\n[5,3,5]\n\n[3,3,5]\n\n[5,3,5]\n\nBut looking at the training examples, sometimes the output rows have 5s except for the largest region. For example, example3's output has the middle row as all 4s, others as 5s.\n\nSo this seems consistent. Therefore, the test input's output should be:\n\n[5,3,5]\n\n[3,3,5]\n\n[5,3,5]"
