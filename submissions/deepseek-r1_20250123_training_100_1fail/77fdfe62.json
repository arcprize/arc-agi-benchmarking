        "cot_1": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. I have these input grids and their corresponding outputs, and I need to find out how the input is transformed into the output. Then apply that to the test input.\n\nFirst, let's look at the training examples. Let's start with Example 0. The input is an 8x8 grid. The output is a 4x4 grid. So maybe the input is being split into quadrants or something? Let's check.\n\nIn Example 0's input, the first row is [2,1,0,0,0,0,1,3]. The output's first row is [0,2,0,0]. Hmm. Not sure yet. Let's look at the entire grid. The input grid has numbers like 2,1,0, etc. The output seems to have some numbers that might be sums or counts.\n\nLooking at the positions of non-zero numbers in the input. For instance, in Example 0's input, the corners are 2,3,4,6 (top-left, top-right, bottom-left, bottom-right). The output in Example 0 is four rows. Wait, maybe the output is combining the corners in some way? Let's see the first output row is [0,2,0,0]. The second row [2,2,0,3], third [0,0,6,0], fourth [4,0,6,6]. Wait, 2,3,4,6 are present here. The last row's first element is 4, which matches the bottom-left corner 4. The third row's third element is 6, which matches the bottom-right 6. But how do the other numbers come into play?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is derived from the borders of the input. For instance, the input grids in the examples have a structure where the first and last rows are like borders (with non-1 elements), and the middle rows have 1s and 8s and 0s. For example, in Example 0, the first row is [2,1,0,0,0,0,1,3], then the next rows have 1s in the first and seventh position. Wait, maybe the 1s are forming a kind of boundary, and the other numbers (like 8s) are inside. So perhaps the output is processing the non-1 and non-border elements?\n\nWait, looking at Example 0's output, the numbers 2,3,4,6 appear in the output. Those are the corner values of the input. The first element of the input is 2, last of the first row is 3. The last row's first is 4, last is 6. So maybe the output is combining these corners in some way. The output has four rows. Let's see:\n\nOutput of Example 0:\n[0, 2, 0, 0]\n[2, 2, 0, 3]\n[0, 0, 6, 0]\n[4, 0, 6, 6]\n\nSo the corners of the output might be related. The first element of the output's first row is 0, but the second element is 2. The second row's first element is 2 (from the top-left input corner), and last is 3 (top-right input corner). Third row's third is 6 (bottom-right input), and fourth row's first is 4 (bottom-left input) and third and fourth are 6. Hmm, maybe each quadrant of the output is combining the input's corners and some other elements.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each cell in the output is a sum or count of certain elements from the input. Let's think about how the input is structured. In Example 0's input, rows 1 and 6 are all 1s. Rows 0 and 7 are the top and bottom borders with numbers. The middle rows (rows 2-5) have 1s in the first and seventh positions (columns 0 and 6?), and 8s and 0s elsewhere. The output might be processing the 8s and the border numbers.\n\nWait, maybe the 8s in the input form some pattern, and the output is counting the number of 8s in each quadrant? Let's check Example 0. The input rows 2-5 (third to sixth rows) have 8s. For example, row 2: [0,1,0,8,0,0,1,0]. So in the third row (index 2), there's an 8 at position 3. The fourth row (index 3) has two 8s. The fifth row (index4) has an 8 at position4. The sixth row (index5) has three 8s. How does this relate to the output?\n\nThe output for Example 0 has numbers like 6 in the third row. Maybe it's summing the 8s? Let's count. In Example 0's input, how many 8s are there?\n\nRow 2: 1\nRow3:2\nRow4:1\nRow5:3\nTotal: 1+2+1+3=7. But the output has 6 in some places. Not sure. Alternatively, maybe the 8s in each quadrant are summed. Let's imagine dividing the input into quadrants. For an 8x8 grid, each quadrant is 4x4. But the output is 4x4. Hmm.\n\nWait, in Example 0's output, the third row is [0,0,6,0]. Maybe the 6 is the sum of 8s in a particular region. Let's check. The input's middle rows (2-5) may form a 4x8 area. If we split that into left and right halves (4x4 each), but the output is 4x4. Alternatively, maybe the 8s are grouped in some way, and the output counts the number of 8s in each 2x2 block?\n\nAlternatively, looking at the output structure, the numbers in the output seem to be arranged in a way that relates to the borders. For instance, the output in Example 0's first row is [0,2,0,0]. The 2 might come from the top-left corner (2) of the input. The third row's 6 comes from the bottom-right corner (6). The second row's last element is 3 (top-right input corner). The fourth row's first element is 4 (bottom-left input corner). So perhaps each quadrant of the output corresponds to the four corners. Then, the other numbers in the output are the counts of 8s in the adjacent regions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is created by taking the four corners of the input (2,3,4,6) and then arranging them in a 2x2 grid, but then expanding them with other elements. Let's see Example 0's output:\n\nRow0: 0,2,0,0 \u2192 maybe 2 is the top-left corner.\n\nRow1: 2,2,0,3 \u2192 2 and 3 here (top-left and top-right)\n\nRow2: 0,0,6,0 \u2192 6 is bottom-right\n\nRow3:4,0,6,6 \u2192 4 is bottom-left, 6 is bottom-right.\n\nBut how does this fit into 4 rows? Maybe each corner is part of a 2x2 block in the output, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps the output is a 4x4 grid where each cell is formed by combining two elements from the input's borders. For example, the first row of the output could be the first and last elements of the input's top row, then the next elements from the bottom row's first and last. Let me check.\n\nExample 0's input's first row is [2,1,0,0,0,0,1,3]. The first and last elements are 2 and 3. The last row is [4,1,0,0,0,0,1,6], first and last elements 4 and 6. So the output's first row is [0,2,0,0] which doesn't match. Hmm, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is derived by taking the four corners of the input as the corners of the output. Then, the numbers in between are derived from the 8s. For instance, the output's corners are 2,3,4,6. Then, the other elements in the output could be counts of 8s in certain regions. Let's see.\n\nIn Example 0's input, the 8s are in rows 2-5. Let's count how many 8s are in each quadrant. If the input is divided into four quadrants (top-left, top-right, bottom-left, bottom-right), each quadrant being 4x4. Let's see:\n\nTop-left quadrant (rows 0-3, columns 0-3):\n\nRow2 (third row): [0,1,0,8] \u2192 one 8 in column 3.\n\nRow3: [0,1,8,8] \u2192 two 8s in columns 2 and 3.\n\nSo total in top-left quadrant: 3 8s? Wait, rows 0-3: rows 0 is [2,1,0,0], row1 is all 1s, row2 has 0,1,0,8, row3 has 0,1,8,8. So in columns 0-3 of rows 2 and 3, there's 0+0 (row2 cols0-3: 0,1,0,8 \u2192 1 eight), row3 cols0-3: 0,1,8,8 \u2192 2 eights. So total 3 eights in top-left quadrant?\n\nBut Example 0's output has a 2 in the second element of the first row. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is formed by taking the sum of 8s in each column of the middle rows. For example, the middle rows (excluding the first and last) in Example 0 are rows 1-6 (but row1 is all 1s, rows 2-5 have 8s). Wait, row1 in the input is all 1s. So maybe the middle rows are rows 2-5. Let's count the 8s in each column for those rows.\n\nIn Example 0, rows 2-5 (indices 2 to 5):\n\nRow2: [0,1,0,8,0,0,1,0] \u2192 8 in column3.\n\nRow3: [0,1,8,8,0,8,1,0] \u2192 columns2,3,5 have 8s.\n\nRow4: [0,1,0,0,8,0,1,0] \u2192 column4.\n\nRow5: [0,1,8,0,8,8,1,0] \u2192 columns2,4,5.\n\nSo per column in rows 2-5:\n\nColumns0: all 0s.\n\nColumn1: all 1s.\n\nColumn2: 0 (row2),8 (row3),0 (row4),8 (row5) \u2192 total 2 eights.\n\nColumn3:8 (row2),8 (row3),0 (row4),0 (row5) \u2192 2 eights.\n\nColumn4:0,0,8,8 \u2192 2 eights.\n\nColumn5:0,8,0,8 \u2192 2 eights.\n\nColumn6: all 1s.\n\nColumn7: all 0s.\n\nSo each column in the middle has 2 eights except column2 has 2, column3 has 2, etc. But how does this relate to the output?\n\nThe output for Example 0 has numbers like 6 in some places. For example, the third row of the output has 6. Maybe the sum of 8s in certain regions is divided by something. For example, 6 could be 3 eights, but 3*8=24, which is not matching. Alternatively, the count of 8s. Let's see.\n\nIn Example 0's output, third row is [0,0,6,0]. If the 6 is the count of 8s in the bottom-right quadrant (columns4-7, rows4-7), let's check.\n\nIn rows4-7, columns4-7:\n\nRow4: columns4-7:8,0,1,0 \u2192 1 eight.\n\nRow5: columns4-7:8,8,1,0 \u2192 2 eights.\n\nRow6: all 1s.\n\nRow7: columns4-7:0,0,1,6 \u2192 no eights.\n\nSo total in that quadrant: 1+2 =3. But output has 6. Not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 8s are summed, but 8s are considered as 1 each. So count of 8s. Then in Example0's input, the total number of 8s is:\n\nRow2:1\n\nRow3:3 (columns2,3,5)\n\nRow4:1 (column4)\n\nRow5:3 (columns2,4,5)\n\nTotal: 1+3+1+3=8. But output has 6 in some cells. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each output cell corresponds to a diagonal or something. Let's look at the output in Example0 again. The third row's third element is 6. The input's bottom-right corner is 6. So maybe the output's corners are the input's corners, and the other cells are counts of 8s in certain regions.\n\nLooking at the output's structure for Example0:\n\nRow0: [0,2,0,0]\n\nRow1: [2,2,0,3]\n\nRow2: [0,0,6,0]\n\nRow3: [4,0,6,6]\n\nThe input's corners are 2 (top-left), 3 (top-right),4 (bottom-left),6 (bottom-right). These numbers appear in the output at positions:\n\n2 is in row0 column1, row1 columns0 and1.\n\n3 is in row1 column3.\n\n4 is in row3 column0.\n\n6 is in row2 column2, row3 columns2 and3.\n\nHmm, this seems scattered. Maybe the output is a combination of the four corners and the counts of 8s in certain quadrants. For example, the middle cells (non-corner cells) in the output are counts of 8s in some regions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is constructed by taking the four corners of the input (2,3,4,6) and then in between, there are elements derived from the 8s. For instance, the output is a 4x4 grid where the corners are 2,3,4,6, and the inner elements are counts or sums of 8s in the input's middle area.\n\nBut how are they arranged? Let's see the output for Example0. The corners of the output (assuming it's 4x4) would be:\n\nTop-left: 0\n\nTop-right:0\n\nBottom-left:4\n\nBottom-right:0 (row0: [0,2,0,0], so top-left is 0, top-right is 0. Row3: [4,0,6,6], bottom-left is4, bottom-right is6. Wait, this doesn't match the input's corners. So maybe not.\n\nAnother approach: maybe the output is formed by looking at the borders of the input grid. The input grid has numbers in the first and last rows and columns. For example, the first row has 2,3, the last row has4,6, and the first and last columns have other numbers. Then the output is a compressed version where each border element is combined.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the outputs for all examples:\n\nExample0's output has four rows. Example1's output has two rows. Example2's output has four rows. So the number of output rows depends on the size of the input. For instance, Example1's input is 6x6. The output is 2 rows. Example0 and 2's inputs are 8x8, outputs are 4 rows. So maybe the output has half the number of rows as the input, rounded down. But Example0's input is 8 rows, output is4. Example1's input is6 rows, output is2. Example2's input is8 rows, output4. Test input is10 rows, so output would be5? But the output for the examples seems to have a square structure. Wait, Example1's output is 2 rows each with two elements. So 2x2. Example0 and 2's outputs are4x4. So the output is a square matrix of size (n/2) x (n/2), where n is the number of rows in the input. For example, input with 8 rows \u2192 4x4 output. 6 rows \u21923x3? But Example1's input is 6 rows, but output is 2x2. Hmm, that doesn't fit. Wait, no. Example1's input is 6 rows. So 6/2=3, but output is 2x2. So that theory is wrong.\n\nLooking at Example1's input:\n\nIt's a 6x6 grid. The output is two rows, each with two elements. So 2x2. So the output size is perhaps (k x k) where k is (number of 1's rows divided by something). Wait, maybe the input has a structure where the first and last rows are borders, and the middle rows are enclosed by 1s. For example, in Example0, the input has rows of 1s as the second and seventh rows. So between them are four rows (rows2-5). The output is4x4. Similarly, Example1's input has 1s in rows1 and4 (assuming input is 6 rows: indexes0-5). So rows1 and4 are 1s, enclosing rows2-3 (2 rows). The output is 2x2. So the number of output rows is equal to the number of enclosed rows. For Example0, 4 enclosed rows \u21924 output rows. Example1:2 enclosed rows \u21922 output rows. Example2's input has 8 rows, with 1s in rows1 and6, enclosing rows2-5 (4 rows), so output4x4. The test input has 10 rows. The first and last rows are borders. Then rows1 and8 are all 1s. So enclosed rows are 2-7 (6 rows). So output would be6 rows, but looking at the training examples, the number of output rows is equal to the number of enclosed rows divided by something. Wait, in Example0, 4 enclosed rows \u21924 output rows. So same number. Example1:2 enclosed rows \u21922 output rows. So the output rows match the number of enclosed rows. But in Example0's output, each row has four elements. So perhaps each enclosed row in the input contributes a row to the output, and the elements are derived from that row.\n\nSo for each enclosed row in the input (rows between the 1s), we take that row and process it into a row of the output.\n\nLooking at Example0's enclosed rows (rows2-5):\n\nRow2: [0,1,0,8,0,0,1,0]\n\nRow3: [0,1,8,8,0,8,1,0]\n\nRow4: [0,1,0,0,8,0,1,0]\n\nRow5: [0,1,8,0,8,8,1,0]\n\nEach of these rows is processed into an output row. Let's see the output rows:\n\nOutput row0: [0,2,0,0]\n\nOutput row1: [2,2,0,3]\n\nOutput row2: [0,0,6,0]\n\nOutput row3: [4,0,6,6]\n\nHmm, not sure. Let's take row2 of the input (third row). How does that become [0,2,0,0]?\n\nWait, perhaps each output row is formed by taking the non-1 and non-zero elements from the corresponding enclosed row. For example, in row2 of input (Example0), the elements are 0,1,0,8,0,0,1,0. The non-1 and non-zero elements are the 8. So maybe sum them? But the output row0 has 0,2,0,0. Not sure. Alternatively, the 8's position is considered. The 8 is in column3. How does that relate to the output's first row?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the numbers in the output are derived from the numbers in the input's borders and the 8s in the enclosed rows. Let's think: The output for Example0's first row (0,2,0,0) might correspond to the first enclosed row (row2 in input). The 2 could be from the top-left corner (2), and maybe the 8's count or position is added. But not sure.\n\nAnother observation: The numbers in the output grids sometimes appear to be adjacent. For example, in Example0's output, the third row is [0,0,6,0], which includes the bottom-right corner of the input (6). The fourth row has [4,0,6,6], which includes the bottom-left (4) and 6 again. So maybe each output row combines the values from the left and right borders of the input, along with the 8s.\n\nLooking at the test input:\n\nThe input is a 10x10 grid. The first row is [3,1,0,...], and the last row is [7,1,0,...5]. The second row (index1) and the ninth row (index8) are all 1s. So the enclosed rows are indices2-7 (rows 2-7), which is 6 rows. According to the previous examples, the output should have 6 rows. But looking at the training examples, Example0 has 4 enclosed rows \u21924 output rows. Example1 has 2 enclosed rows \u21922 output rows. So this test case's output should have6 rows. But the test input's output examples for training are 4x4 and 2x2. Wait, but Example2's input is 8 rows, enclosed rows 4 \u2192 output 4x4. So the output for the test case would be 6 rows, each of certain elements.\n\nBut how are the elements derived? Let's think again.\n\nLooking at Example1's input:\n\nInput rows:\n\n[9, 1, 0, 0, 1,4]\n\n[1,1,1,1,1,1]\n\n[0,1,8,8,1,0]\n\n[0,1,8,0,1,0]\n\n[1,1,1,1,1,1]\n\n[2,1,0,0,1,3]\n\nEnclosed rows are rows2 and3. Output is two rows: [9,4] and [2,0]. The first output row has the first element of the input's first row (9) and the last element of the first row (4). The second output row has the first element of the last input row (2) and the last element of the last input row (3). Wait, but the output is [2,0], not 2 and3. Hmm, maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, looking at Example1's output: [9,4] and [2,0]. The 9 is the first element of the input's first row. 4 is the last element of the first row. 2 is the first element of the last row. 0 is perhaps the sum of some 8s. In Example1's enclosed rows (rows2 and3), the 8s are in row2: two 8s, row3: one 8. Total 3. But the output has 0. Not sure.\n\nAnother approach: Maybe the output combines the border numbers (from the first and last rows) and the count of 8s in each enclosed row. For Example1, enclosed rows are two. So output is two rows. For each enclosed row, the output row takes the first element of the first input row and the last element of the first input row, or something like that.\n\nWait, in Example1's output, the first row is [9,4]. The first input row starts with9 and ends with4. The last input row starts with2 and ends with3. The output's second row is [2,0]. Hmm, so 2 is from the last row's first element. 0 is not matching the 3. But maybe the 0 is the count of 8s in the corresponding enclosed row. For row2 of the input (enclosed rows), there are two 8s. Row3 has one 8. So if the output rows for Example1 are:\n\nFirst output row: [9 (first element of first input row), 4 (last element of first input row)].\n\nSecond output row: [2 (first element of last input row), sum of 8s in enclosed rows (2+1=3?)]. But the output has [2,0]. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for each enclosed row, the output row is formed by taking the first element of the first input row, then the last element of the first input row, then the first element of the last input row, then the last element of the last input row. But Example1's output has two rows, each with two elements. So maybe per enclosed row, two elements are added. But not sure.\n\nAnother angle: Let's look at the output for Example2. The input's first row is [6,1,0,0,0,0,1,2], last row [7,1,0,0,0,0,1,4]. The output has four rows. The first output row is [0,6,0,2]. The 6 is the first element of the first input row, and 2 is the last element of the first row. The third output row is [7,0,4,4], which are the first and last elements of the last input row. So perhaps each output row combines elements from the first and last rows of the input. For example, first and last elements of the first and last rows.\n\nBut how does this fit with the number of output rows? For Example0, the output has four rows, which matches the four enclosed rows. For each enclosed row, the output row is formed by taking the first and last elements of the input's first and last rows, and something related to the 8s.\n\nAlternatively, for each enclosed row in the input, the output row is formed by combining the left border value (from the first element of the first input row) and the right border value (last element of the first input row), then the left and right from the last input row, plus counts of 8s in the current enclosed row.\n\nFor example, in Example1, the first enclosed row (row2) has two 8s, so maybe the output row is [9,4] (from the first input row's first and last) plus something. But the second output row is [2,0], which is the first and last elements of the last input row. But where does the 0 come from? Maybe the number of 8s in the enclosed row. Row3 of Example1's input has one 8. So the first enclosed row has two 8s, but the output is [9,4], which doesn't include the count. So that might not be the case.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is a combination of the four corners of the input, arranged in a specific way, and the 8s in the enclosed rows are summed or counted in between. For example, Example0's input corners are 2,3,4,6. The output for Example0 has these numbers placed in specific positions, and the other numbers are counts of 8s in certain regions.\n\nBut I'm not seeing a clear pattern. Maybe I need to look at how the 8s are arranged in the input and how they appear in the output. Let's take Example0's input enclosed rows:\n\nRow2: 0,1,0,8,0,0,1,0 \u2192 8 at column3.\n\nRow3:0,1,8,8,0,8,1,0 \u2192 8s at columns2,3,5.\n\nRow4:0,1,0,0,8,0,1,0 \u2192 8 at column4.\n\nRow5:0,1,8,0,8,8,1,0 \u2192 8s at columns2,4,5.\n\nThe output for Example0 has:\n\nRow0:0,2,0,0\n\nRow1:2,2,0,3\n\nRow2:0,0,6,0\n\nRow3:4,0,6,6\n\nThe 2,3,4,6 are the corners. The other numbers (0s and 6s) might relate to the 8s. Let's see the third row of the output: 6. Maybe in that region, there are 6 eights. Let's count. For example, in Example0's input, the 8s are in rows2-5. If the output's third row corresponds to row4 of the input (which has 1 eight), but the output row2 has 6. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, the output's elements are the sum of the 8s in each quadrant when the input is divided into four quadrants. For Example0's input:\n\nQuadrants:\n\nTop-left: rows0-3, columns0-3.\n\nTop-right: rows0-3, columns4-7.\n\nBottom-left: rows4-7, columns0-3.\n\nBottom-right: rows4-7, columns4-7.\n\nCount of 8s in each quadrant:\n\nTop-left: row2 column3 (1), row3 columns2-3 (2) \u2192 total 3.\n\nTop-right: row3 column5 (1).\n\nBottom-left: row4 column4 (0), since columns0-3 would be columns0-3 of rows4-7. Row4 columns0-3: 0,1,0,0 \u2192 no 8s. Row5 columns0-3:0,1,8,0 \u2192 one 8. Row6: all 1s. Row7: columns0-3:4,1,0,0 \u2192 no 8s. So bottom-left quadrant: one 8.\n\nBottom-right: row4 column4 (8), row5 columns4-5 (8,8). So row4:8 in column4 (which is in columns4-7). So row4's 8 is in column4. row5's columns4-7:8,8,1,0 \u2192 two 8s. So bottom-right quadrant: 1 (row4) + 2 (row5) =3. Also, row3's column5 is in top-right quadrant.\n\nSo total 8s per quadrant: top-left 3, top-right1, bottom-left1, bottom-right3. So sum of 3+1+1+3=8. But Example0's output has numbers like 6. Maybe the numbers are multiplied? Not sure.\n\nBut Example0's output has a 6 in the third row. How does that relate? The bottom-right quadrant has3 eights, which could be 3*2=6, but why multiplied by 2?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output cells are the sum of the 8s in each quadrant plus the corner values. For example, the bottom-right quadrant has3 eights. The bottom-right corner of the input is6. So 3+6=9, but the output has6. So not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is formed by taking the sum of 8s in each enclosed row and then combining them with the border numbers. For Example0, enclosed rows have 1,3,1,3 eights. Summing these gives 8. But the output has a 6 in some rows. Not sure.\n\nAnother idea: Perhaps the output is a diamond shape or some other geometric pattern. Looking at the outputs, the numbers are sometimes arranged in a way that the corners of the output are the corners of the input. For Example0, the corners of the output are 0,0,4,6. But the input's corners are2,3,4,6. So only 4 and6 match. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the output is constructed by placing the four corner values of the input in specific positions and filling the rest with counts of 8s. For example, in Example0's output, the corners of the output are 0 (top-left), 0 (top-right),4 (bottom-left),6 (bottom-right). The input's corners are2,3,4,6. So 4 and6 are present, but 2 and3 are inside the output. In row0, column1 is2. Row1, column3 is3. So perhaps the corners of the output are the counts of 8s in the quadrants, and the inner numbers are the input's corners. But this is getting complicated.\n\nLet's try a different approach. Let's compare the input and output of Example1.\n\nInput:\n\n[9, 1, 0, 0, 1,4]\n\n[1,1,1,1,1,1]\n\n[0,1,8,8,1,0]\n\n[0,1,8,0,1,0]\n\n[1,1,1,1,1,1]\n\n[2,1,0,0,1,3]\n\nOutput:\n\n[9,4]\n\n[2,0]\n\nThe output has two rows. The first row is [9,4], which are the first and last elements of the first input row. The second row is [2,0], which are the first element of the last input row and 0. Where does the 0 come from? The last input row's last element is3. Maybe the 0 is the count of 8s in the enclosed rows. Let's count:\n\nEnclosed rows are rows2 and3.\n\nRow2: two 8s.\n\nRow3: one 8.\n\nTotal 3. But output has 0. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, for each enclosed row, the output row is the first and last elements of the input's first and last rows, and the number of 8s in that enclosed row. For Example1:\n\nEnclosed row2: two 8s. Output row0:9 (first element of input row0) and4 (last element of input row0). But the output row0 is [9,4], which matches this. Then enclosed row3: one 8. Output row1:2 (first element of input's last row) and0. Hmm, but where does the0 come from? The input's last row ends with3. So maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, the output rows are the first element of the first row and the last element of the first row for even-numbered enclosed rows, and the first and last elements of the last row for odd-numbered enclosed rows. But in Example1, there are two enclosed rows, so two output rows. First output row [9,4], second [2,3]. But the actual output is [2,0]. So that doesn't fit.\n\nWait, the output of Example1 is [9,4] and [2,0]. The second row's second element is0. Maybe 0 is the count of 8s in the corresponding enclosed row. For row3 of the input (enclosed row1), there's one 8. But 0 is not 1. So perhaps it's something else.\n\nAnother observation: The output grids in the examples have elements that are either border numbers from the input or zeros. Maybe the zeros are placeholders for no 8s in certain positions. \n\nLooking back at Example0's output:\n\nThe third row has 6 in the third column, which is the bottom-right corner of the input. The fourth row has 4 and6s. Perhaps the output is a rotation or reflection of the input's corners and certain 8 counts.\n\nAlternatively, the output is generated by taking each enclosed row, and for each element in that row, if it's 8, it contributes to the output in a certain way. For example, each 8 in an enclosed row adds to the count in the output's corresponding position, but the output is smaller. Maybe the output is the sum of 8s in each 2x2 block of the input's enclosed rows.\n\nLet's try this for Example0. The enclosed rows are rows2-5. For each 2x2 block in these rows, sum the 8s.\n\nFor Example0's enclosed rows:\n\nRow2: [0,1,0,8,0,0,1,0]\n\nRow3: [0,1,8,8,0,8,1,0]\n\nRow4: [0,1,0,0,8,0,1,0]\n\nRow5: [0,1,8,0,8,8,1,0]\n\nDividing into 2x2 blocks:\n\nBut the enclosed area is 4 rows (rows2-5) and 8 columns. To create a 4x4 output, perhaps each 2x2 block in the enclosed rows is summed. Let's see:\n\nColumns 0-1:\n\nRow2-3: 0,1 and 0,1 \u2192 no 8s.\n\nColumns2-3:\n\nRow2:0,8 \u2192 1 eight.\n\nRow3:8,8 \u2192 2 eights.\n\nTotal for this block: 3 \u2192 but output row0 is [0,2,0,0]. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, each column pair in the enclosed rows is summed. For example, columns0-1, 2-3,4-5,6-7. For each of the four enclosed rows, sum the 8s in each column pair.\n\nFor Example0's enclosed rows:\n\nRow2:\n\nColumns0-1:0,1 \u21920.\n\nColumns2-3:0,8 \u21921.\n\nColumns4-5:0,0 \u21920.\n\nColumns6-7:1,0 \u21920.\n\nSo sums for row2: 0,1,0,0 \u2192 matches output row0 [0,2,0,0]? Not exactly. The output row0 has 0,2,0,0. So maybe the sum is multiplied by something. Or maybe the sum is for each pair of columns across all enclosed rows.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each output cell represents the sum of 8s in a certain cell across the enclosed rows. For example, output cell (i,j) is the count of 8s in enclosed row i, position j*2 and j*2+1. \n\nFor Example0's output being 4x4:\n\nEach output row corresponds to an enclosed row, and each output cell corresponds to two columns. Let's check:\n\nOutput row0 (enclosed row2):\n\nColumns0-1:0,1 \u21920.\n\nColumns2-3:0,8 \u21921.\n\nColumns4-5:0,0 \u21920.\n\nColumns6-7:1,0 \u21920.\n\nSum for each pair: 0,1,0,0. So output row0 would be [0,1,0,0]. But the actual output is [0,2,0,0]. So not matching.\n\nAnother approach: Looking at Example1's output [9,4] and [2,0], maybe the first element of each output row is taken from the first element of the input's first row (9) and the first element of the input's last row (2). The second element of each output row is the last element of the input's first row (4) and the sum of 8s in the enclosed rows (3), but the output has0. This doesn't fit. \n\nWait, in Example1's output, the second row's second element is0. The enclosed rows have three 8s. Maybe the output's elements are the number of 8s in each column of the enclosed rows, but modulo something. For Example1's enclosed rows:\n\nRow2: columns2 and3 are8s.\n\nRow3: column2 is8.\n\nSo columns2 has 2 eights, column3 has1.\n\nIf the output's second row is [2,0], maybe 2 is the count of 8s in column2, and 0 is column3's count modulo something. But why 0? This isn't clear.\n\nMaybe the output is constructed by taking the corners of the input and placing them in the output's corners, then filling the middle with counts of 8s in certain regions. For Example0, input corners are2,3,4,6. Output corners are0,0,4,6. The middle elements are counts of 8s. But how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is formed by rotating the corners of the input and adding counts of 8s in between. For Example0's input corners: 2 (top-left),3 (top-right),4 (bottom-left),6 (bottom-right). Rotated to form the output corners as0,2,4,6. But not sure.\n\nThis is getting quite complicated. Let's try to think of the test input and see if any patterns can be observed.\n\nTest Input:\n\n10 rows. The first row is [3,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,4]. Last row is [7,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,5]. The rows with all 1s are row1 and row8. So enclosed rows are rows2-7 (6 rows). So the output should have6 rows. Each row in the output would correspond to an enclosed row.\n\nLooking at the enclosed rows:\n\nRow2: [0,1,0,8,8,0,0,0,1,0]\n\nRow3: [0,1,8,8,8,0,8,0,1,0]\n\nRow4: [0,1,0,0,8,0,8,0,1,0]\n\nRow5: [0,1,0,8,0,8,8,0,1,0]\n\nRow6: [0,1,8,8,0,8,0,8,1,0]\n\nRow7: [0,1,0,8,0,0,8,0,1,0]\n\nEach of these rows has 1s in positions1 and8. The other elements are 0s and 8s. The output for each row could be related to the number of 8s and the border values.\n\nThe first row of the input is [3,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,4]. The first element is3, last is4. The last row is [7,1,0,...,5], first element7, last5.\n\nMaybe each output row takes the first and last elements of the first and last input rows, and the number of 8s in the enclosed row. For example, for each enclosed row:\n\nOutput row would be [first of first row, last of first row, first of last row, count of 8s in enclosed row]\n\nBut Example0's output rows are four elements. For example, the first output row is [0,2,0,0]. If the enclosed row has 1 8 (row2), then maybe:\n\n[3,4,7, count of 8s in row2].\n\nRow2 of test input has 2 eights (at columns3 and4). So the output row would be [3,4,7,2]. But in Example0, the first output row is [0,2,0,0], which doesn't fit this pattern. So this is likely incorrect.\n\nAnother idea: Maybe the output is formed by taking the first and last elements of the input's first and last rows, and for each enclosed row, creating a row in the output with these elements, but modified based on the 8s in that enclosed row.\n\nFor example, the first and last elements of the input's first row are3 and4. The first and last of the last row are7 and5. For each enclosed row, if there are 8s in that row, the output row is formed by adding these values in some way.\n\nAlternatively, the output is constructed by concatenating the first element of the first row and the last element of the first row for each enclosed row, and similarly for the last row. For example, if there are6 enclosed rows, each row in the output would be [3,4] or [7,5], but Example1's output has two rows, each with two elements. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, the output is formed by placing the first and last elements of the first input row in the first and last positions of the output's rows, and similarly for the last input row. For example, each enclosed row's output row starts with3 and ends with4, but the middle elements are counts of 8s. But in Example0's first output row, the middle elements are2 and0, which doesn't fit.\n\nAt this point, I'm struggling to find the pattern. Let's try to see what the examples have in common in their outputs.\n\nLooking at Example0's output:\n\nThe numbers present are 0,2,3,4,6.\n\nExample1's output:9,4,2,0.\n\nExample2's output includes0,2,4,6,7.\n\nThe commonality is that the numbers are from the input's borders (first and last rows' elements) and zeros. The zeros may indicate areas with no 8s.\n\nAnother approach: For each enclosed row, the output row is formed by taking the elements from the input's first and last rows, but only those elements that are adjacent to the 8s in the enclosed row. For example, if an enclosed row has an 8 at a certain column, the output row includes the elements from the first and last rows at that column. But this is vague.\n\nAlternatively, the output is a matrix where each element is the sum of the corresponding elements in the input's first and last rows, but only for columns where the enclosed row has an 8. For example, in Example1's enclosed rows:\n\nRow2 has 8s in columns2 and3. So output row0 would be input's first row columns2 and3 (0 and0) plus last row's columns2 and3 (0 and0) \u21920+0=0, but the output is9 and4. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAnother possibility: The output is a compression of the input's border elements and the enclosed 8s. For each enclosed row, the output row is the sum of the 8s in that row, combined with the border elements. For Example0's first enclosed row (row2) has one 8. The output row is0,2,0,0. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the output is formed by the following steps:\n\n1. The first and last rows of the input are the borders, with their first and last elements being the corners.\n\n2. The enclosed rows (between the all-1s rows) contain 8s and 0s.\n\n3. For each enclosed row, the output row is created by:\n\n   a. Taking the first element of the first row and the last element of the first row.\n\n   b. Taking the first element of the last row and the last element of the last row.\n\n   c. Summing the number of 8s in that enclosed row and placing it in between.\n\nBut Example0's first enclosed row has one 8. The output row0 is [0,2,0,0], which doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, the output is a combination of the input's border corners and the sum of 8s in each quadrant. For Example0, the sum of 8s in each quadrant is3,1,1,3. These sums are arranged in the output's quadrants, and the corners are placed. But how?\n\nExample0's output:\n\n[0,2,0,0]\n\n[2,2,0,3]\n\n[0,0,6,0]\n\n[4,0,6,6]\n\nThe 2 and3 are from the top corners. 4 and6 from the bottom. The 2 in the second row's first position could be the sum of 8s in the top-left quadrant (3) plus the top-left corner (2) \u21925, which doesn't fit. Hmm.\n\nPerhaps the pattern is that the output's elements are the sum of the input's border elements and the count of 8s in certain regions. For example, the first element of the output is the sum of the top-left corner plus the count of 8s in the top-left quadrant. For Example0, top-left corner is2, and the quadrant has3 8s \u21922+3=5. But the output's first element is0. So that's not it.\n\nAt this point, I think I need to consider that the output is generated by taking the first and last elements of the input's first and last rows, and for each enclosed row, creating a row in the output that combines these values and the count of 8s in that row. For example, in Example1, the first enclosed row has two 8s. The output row is [9,4], which are the first and last elements of the first input row. The second enclosed row has one 8. The output row is [2,0], which are the first and last elements of the last input row. The 0 could indicate that there are no 8s in certain positions. But this doesn't fit Example0's outputs.\n\nAlternatively, each output row is formed by taking the first and last elements of the input's first and last rows, and inserting zeros in between. For Example0, the output rows would be [2,3], [2,3], [4,6], [4,6]. But the actual output has different numbers.\n\nGiven that I'm stuck, I'll try to make an educated guess based on the examples.\n\nLooking at the test input:\n\nFirst row: [3,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,4]\n\nLast row: [7,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,5]\n\nEnclosed rows are rows2-7 (6 rows).\n\nIf the pattern from the examples holds, each enclosed row in the input contributes to a row in the output. For each enclosed row, the output row is formed by combining the first and last elements of the input's first and last rows, and possibly the count of 8s in that enclosed row.\n\nFor example, in Example1's output, each enclosed row corresponds to a row in the output. The first enclosed row (two 8s) gives [9,4], which are the first and last of the first input row. The second enclosed row (one 8) gives [2,0], which are the first and last of the last input row. The 0 might indicate something else.\n\nApplying this to the test input:\n\nEnclosed rows are 6. So output should have6 rows. Each row in the output would combine the first and last elements of the input's first and last rows.\n\nFirst input row's first is3, last is4.\n\nLast input row's first is7, last is5.\n\nSo the output rows would alternate between [3,4] and [7,5], but that's not matching the examples.\n\nAlternatively, the output rows are combinations of the first and last elements of the first and last input rows, and the count of 8s in the enclosed row. For example, [3, count of 8s in row, 4], but the outputs in examples have varying lengths.\n\nAlternatively, each enclosed row contributes two numbers to the output: the first and last of the first row, then the first and last of the last row. For example, in Example1's two enclosed rows, the output has two rows: [9,4] and [2,0]. So per enclosed row, one output row. So for six enclosed rows, six output rows, each with two elements: [3,4] and [7,5], but how are they arranged?\n\nBut in Example0's four enclosed rows, the output has four rows, each with four elements. So the structure varies. Hmm.\n\nAnother observation: In Example0 and Example2, the output has multiple elements per row, which seem to be combinations of the corners and some counts. For instance, Example0's output has four elements per row. The first element of each row is either 0,2,0,4. The 2 and4 are corners. The second elements are 2,2,0,0. The third elements are 0,0,6,6. The fourth elements are 0,3,0,6. This suggests that each output row is a combination of the four corners and some counts.\n\nBut I'm still not seeing it. Given the time I've spent and the complexity, I think the pattern likely involves taking the corners of the input and placing them in specific positions in the output, and the other elements are counts or sums of 8s in certain regions. For the test input, the corners are3,4,7,5. So the output might have these numbers in specific positions, and other numbers based on the 8s in the enclosed rows.\n\nIn the test input's enclosed rows, each has a certain number of 8s:\n\nRow2: two 8s (columns3,4)\n\nRow3: four 8s (columns2,3,4,6)\n\nRow4: two 8s (columns4,6)\n\nRow5: three 8s (columns3,5,6)\n\nRow6: four 8s (columns2,3,5,7)\n\nRow7: two 8s (columns3,6)\n\nSo the counts per enclosed row are:2,4,2,3,4,2.\n\nIf the output is formed by these counts combined with the corners:\n\nFor example, each output row has two elements: the count of 8s in the enclosed row and one of the corners. But in Example1's output, the counts are2 and1, but the output is [9,4] and [2,0], which doesn't fit.\n\nAnother idea: The output is created by taking the input's first and last rows, and for each element in these rows (excluding the 1s), they are placed in the output's corners, and the middle elements are counts of 8s in certain regions. For example, in Example0's input, the first and last rows have non-1 elements at the start and end. These are placed in the output's corners, and the middle elements are counts of 8s in each enclosed row.\n\nBut this is too vague.\n\nGiven that I'm stuck, I'll try to look for another pattern. Let's look at the output for Example0:\n\nOutput rows:\n\n[0, 2, 0, 0]\n\n[2, 2, 0, 3]\n\n[0, 0, 6, 0]\n\n[4, 0, 6, 6]\n\nThe numbers 2,3,4,6 are the input's corners. The 2 appears multiple times. The 6 appears in the third row. The 4 in the fourth row. The 3 in the second row. The zeros might be placeholders.\n\nLooking at the positions of 2,3,4,6 in the output:\n\n- 2 is in row0 column1, row1 columns0 and1.\n\n-3 is in row1 column3.\n\n-4 is in row3 column0.\n\n-6 is in row2 column2, row3 columns2 and3.\n\nThis suggests a diagonal or some arrangement where the corners of the input are placed along the output's diagonal.\n\nFor example:\n\nOutput's diagonal (0,0), (1,1), (2,2), (3,3) would be 0,2,6,6. But the input's corners are2,3,4,6. Not matching.\n\nAnother possibility: The output is a mirror of the input's corners. For Example0, the output has 2 and3 in the top part, 4 and6 in the bottom.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and the need to provide an answer, I'll make an educated guess based on the examples.\n\nIn the test input, the output is likely structured as follows:\n\nEach enclosed row (rows2-7) contributes a row to the output. The output rows will have elements that are combinations of the input's first and last row's first and last elements (3,4,7,5) and the count of 8s in each enclosed row.\n\nFor example, the output might have rows like [3, count, count,4], [7, count, count,5], etc. But looking at Example0's output, the first row is [0,2,0,0], which includes the input's first row's first element (2) but not the last. So perhaps it's different.\n\nAlternatively, the output is a matrix where each row is formed by the first element of the first input row, the last element of the first input row, the first element of the last input row, and the last element of the last input row. For Example0's input, this would be [2,3,4,6], but the output is four rows. So this doesn't fit.\n\nGiven the time I've invested and the examples, I'll conclude that the output is generated by taking the first and last elements of the input's first and last rows, arranging them in a specific way, and including the count of 8s in the enclosed rows. \n\nFor the test input, the enclosed rows are six. The output should have six rows. Each row would combine the input's first and last elements from the first and last rows and the count of 8s in that enclosed row. But Example1's output doesn't follow this, so this might not be correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is formed by taking the input's first and last elements of each row and combining them. For the enclosed rows, they have 1s at the start and end. So their first and last elements are 0 or 8. But the outputs in examples have the border elements from the first and last input rows.\n\nGiven the lack of clarity, I'll proceed to guess that the output is formed by taking the first and last elements of the input's first and last rows and placing them in the output's corners, with other elements being counts of 8s. For the test input, this would result in:\n\n[3,4]\n\n[7,5]\n\nBut this is a guess. However, looking at Example1's output, which has two enclosed rows, the output is two rows combining the first and last elements of the first and last input rows. So for the test input's six enclosed rows, perhaps the output is:\n\n[3,4]\n\n[3,4]\n\n[3,4]\n\n[7,5]\n\n[7,5]\n\n[7,5]\n\nBut this doesn't match the examples.\n\nAlternatively, each enclosed row contributes to two elements in the output, alternating between the first and last elements of the first and last input rows. For six enclosed rows, the output would be three rows of [3,5] and three of [7,4], but this is not matching.\n\nAnother possibility: The output is a combination of the input's first and last elements, and for each enclosed row, the sum of 8s is placed in between. For example, each output row is [first of first row, sum of 8s in enclosed row, last of first row]. But Example0's first enclosed row has1 8, so output row would be [2,1,3], but the actual output is different.\n\nGiven the time constraints, I'll have to make a guess. Looking at Example0 and Example2, the output seems to be a 4x4 grid where the corners are the input's corners and the other elements are counts of 8s in certain regions. For the test input, which has 10 rows, the output would likely be a 6x4 grid, but the examples show that the output size depends on the input's enclosed rows. However, the examples' outputs are square matrices. So perhaps the test input's output is 6x2, but this is unclear.\n\nAlternatively, the output is formed by taking the first and last elements of the input's first and last rows and combining them in pairs. For the test input, this would be:\n\n[3,4]\n\n[7,5]\n\nBut Example0's output is4x4, which doesn't fit.\n\nGiven all this, I think the correct pattern is that the output consists of the input's first and last rows' first and last elements, arranged in a way that forms a smaller grid, with the enclosed rows' 8s counted and placed between them. For the test input, the output would be:\n\n[3,4]\n\n[7,5]\n\nBut this doesn't match the examples' structure. Therefore, I'm likely missing something.\n\nAfter struggling, I think the pattern involves the following steps:\n\n1. Extract the four corners of the input grid (first row first element, first row last element, last row first element, last row last element).\n\n2. For each enclosed row, count the number of 8s.\n\n3. Arrange these counts and the corners into a specific pattern.\n\nIn Example0, the four corners are2,3,4,6. The enclosed rows have 1,3,1,3 8s. The output is a 4x4 grid with the corners and the counts.\n\nBut I'm not sure how they're arranged. However, the output for Example0 has the corners in positions (0,1), (1,3), (2,2), (3,0), (3,2), (3,3). It's unclear.\n\nGiven the time I've spent, I'll proceed to provide an answer based on the following hypothesis:\n\nThe output is formed by taking the corners of the input and arranging them in the output's corners, with the middle elements being the counts of 8s in the enclosed rows. For example, the test input's corners are3,4,7,5. The enclosed rows have 2,4,2,3,4,2 8s. So the output would be:\n\n[3, 2, 4, 4]\n\n[7, 2, 5, 5]\n\nBut this is a guess. However, considering the examples, the output often has repeated corner values and zeros. For example, Example0's output has [2,2,0,3], which includes the top-left and top-right corners.\n\nAnother guess: The output for each enclosed row is the first element of the first row, followed by the count of 8s in that row, followed by the last element of the first row. For example, in Example1's first enclosed row (2 8s), the output would be [9,2,4], but Example1's output is [9,4], which suggests this is wrong.\n\nGiven that I can't discern the exact pattern, I'll make a guess based on the structure of Example0 and Example2. Their outputs are structured as follows:\n\n- The first element of the output's first row is 0, then the top-left corner of the input (2), then zeros.\n\n- The second row starts with the top-left corner (2), then another 2 (maybe a sum), then 0 and top-right corner (3).\n\n- The third row has the bottom-right corner (6) in the middle.\n\n- The fourth row starts with the bottom-left corner (4), then zeros and 6s.\n\nThis suggests that the output is formed by placing the corners in certain positions and filling the rest with counts of 8s from specific quadrants. For the test input, the corners are3,4,7,5. The enclosed rows have 8s in various columns. The output might look like:\n\n[0,3,0,0]\n\n[3, sum of 8s in top-left quadrant, 0,4]\n\n[0,0,5,0]\n\n[7, sum of 8s in bottom-right quadrant,5,5]\n\nBut without knowing the exact pattern, it's difficult.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and the need to provide an answer, I'll proceed to make an educated guess based on the examples. The output for the test input would likely be:\n\n[3, 4]\n\n[7, 5]\n\nBut according to the examples, especially Example1 which has two enclosed rows and two output rows, the test input with six enclosed rows would produce six output rows. But I'm not sure. Given that, the safest answer given the examples' structure is to take the first and last elements of the first and last rows of the input and arrange them in a square matrix. Since the test input's first row has first and last elements 3 and4, and the last row has7 and5, the output could be:\n\n[3,4]\n\n[7,5]\n\nBut this is a guess. However, looking at Example1's output, which has two rows for two enclosed rows, it's possible that each enclosed row contributes to an output row with the first and last elements of the first and last input rows. For six enclosed rows, the output would be:\n\n[3,4]\n\n[3,4]\n\n[3,4]\n\n[7,5]\n\n[7,5]\n\n[7,5]\n\nBut this doesn't fit the examples' structure. \n\nAnother possible pattern is that the output is formed by taking the first and last elements of the input's first and last rows and then interleaving them with zeros based on the number of enclosed rows. For the test input, with six enclosed rows, the output might be:\n\n[3,0,0,4]\n\n[0,0,0,0]\n\n[0,0,0,0]\n\n[7,0,0,5]\n\nBut this is a stretch.\n\nGiven the complexity and time, I'll proceed to provide an answer based on the following guess: the output is formed by taking the first and last elements of the input's first and last rows and creating a matrix where each row is a combination of these elements, with the number of rows equal to half the number of enclosed rows. But this is just a guess.\n\nFor the test input's enclosed rows (6), the output might have three rows:\n\n[3,4]\n\n[0,0]\n\n[7,5]\n\nBut this is not matching the examples.\n\nAfter much deliberation, I'll settle on the following output for the test input, inspired by Example0 and Example2's structure:\n\n[0,3,0,0]\n\n[3,0,0,4]\n\n[0,0,5,0]\n\n[7,0,5,5]\n\nBut I'm uncertain. However, given the examples, I'll format the answer as per the training examples, likely with multiple rows combining the input's corners and counts of 8s.",

        "cot_2": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. So, looking at the training examples, each input is a 2D array, and the output is another array. Let's start with Example 0.\n\nIn Example 0's input, the first row is [2, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 3], and the output is [0, 2, 0, 0], [2, 2, 0, 3], etc. Hmm. Wait, maybe the output arrays are related to the corners of the input matrix? Let's check the first and last elements of the input rows. The first row starts with 2 and ends with 3, which might correspond to elements in the output. But how?\n\nLooking at the output for Example 0: The first output row is [0, 2, 0, 0]. The input's first element is 2, and the last element of the first row is 3. Then the output rows seem to have elements from the corners and maybe some other positions. Wait, maybe the output is formed by taking the corners of each quadrant or something like that. Let me think.\n\nWait, the input in Example 0 is an 8x8 grid, and the output is a 4x4 grid. So perhaps each 2x2 block in the input is being transformed into a single value in the output. But how? Let me check.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking elements from the borders of the input. For instance, the first and last rows and columns. Let's see. The input for Example 0's first row starts with 2 and ends with 3, and the last row starts with 4 and ends with 6. The output in Example 0's first row is [0, 2, 0, 0]. Wait, maybe the output is combining the first and last elements of each row, but that doesn't quite fit.\n\nAnother approach: Let's look at the positions of non-zero numbers in the output. For Example 0's output, the non-zero numbers are 2, 3, 6, 4, 6, etc. Looking back at the input, maybe these numbers are taken from the corners of the original matrix. For example, the input starts with 2 and ends with 3 in the first row. The last row starts with 4 and ends with 6. So maybe the output combines the first and last elements of the first and last rows, but arranged in some way.\n\nWait, the output for Example 0 has four rows. Let's see:\n\nOutput rows for Example 0:\n\n[0, 2, 0, 0]\n\n[2, 2, 0, 3]\n\n[0, 0, 6, 0]\n\n[4, 0, 6, 6]\n\nLooking at the first row of output, the 2 is in the second position. Maybe the output is built from the corners of the original matrix's quadrants. Let me split the input into quadrants. The input is 8x8, so each quadrant would be 4x4. But the output is 4x4. So maybe each quadrant's corners are taken? For example, the top-left quadrant's top-left is 2, top-right is 0 (from the first row's fourth element?), bottom-left is 0, bottom-right is 0. But how does that form the output?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by looking at the perimeter of the input matrix. The input's perimeter includes the first and last rows and columns. Let's see: the first row has elements 2,1,0,0,0,0,1,3. The last row is [4,1,0,0,0,0,1,6]. The first column would be [2,1,0,0,0,0,1,4], and the last column is [3,1,0,0,0,0,1,6]. Maybe the output is the sum or some combination of these perimeter elements. But in Example 0's output, the numbers 2,3,4,6 appear, which are the first and last elements of the first and last rows.\n\nWait, the first and last elements of the first row are 2 and 3. The first and last elements of the last row are 4 and 6. These numbers do appear in the output. For Example 0's output, the second row ends with 3, the third row has 6, and the fourth row starts with 4 and has 6 again. So maybe the output is formed by taking the corners of the input matrix and arranging them in some way. But how exactly?\n\nLooking at Example 1's input:\n\nInput rows:\n\n[9, 1, 0, 0, 1, 4]\n\n[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]\n\n[0, 1, 8, 8, 1, 0]\n\n[0, 1, 8, 0, 1, 0]\n\n[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]\n\n[2, 1, 0, 0, 1, 3]\n\nOutput:\n\n[9,4]\n\n[2,0]\n\nHmm. The output here is two rows. The first element of the first row is 9 (the first element of the input's first row) and 4 (the last element of the first row). The second row starts with 2 (the first element of the last row) and 0 (the last element of the last row). Wait, the last row of input is [2,1,0,0,1,3], so the last element is 3, but the output's second row ends with 0. That doesn't fit. Wait, maybe the output is taking the first and last elements of the first and last rows, but in this case, the first row's last element is 4, which is present. The last row's first element is 2, and the output's second row starts with 2, but the last element is 0. That's confusing. Wait, the last element of the last row in input is 3, but the output has 0 here. So that's not matching.\n\nWait maybe the output is formed by looking at the 8s in the input. Let's look at Example 0. In Example 0's input, there are some 8s in the middle rows. The output in Example 0 has a 6, which could be a count of 8s? Let's check. For example, in the third row of Example 0's input: [0,1,8,8,0,8,1,0], which has three 8s. The output row [0,0,6,0] has a 6. Hmm, 3*2=6. Maybe each 8 is converted to 2, and summed in some way. But in that row, three 8s would sum to 6, which is 3*2. Then perhaps 8s are counted as 2 each and summed in certain regions.\n\nLooking at Example 0's output third row: [0,0,6,0]. Maybe the 6 is the sum of 8s in a quadrant. Let's check the input for Example 0. The third input row is [0,1,0,8,0,0,1,0]. Wait, the fourth element is 8, fifth is 0, etc. Maybe the input is divided into quadrants, and the number of 8s in each quadrant multiplied by 2. For example, in Example 0's input:\n\nThe third row (index 2) has elements [0,1,0,8,0,0,1,0]. Let's split the input into four quadrants. For an 8x8 matrix, each quadrant is 4x4. So the top-left quadrant is rows 0-3, columns 0-3. The top-right is rows 0-3, columns 4-7. Bottom-left is rows 4-7, columns 0-3. Bottom-right is rows 4-7, columns 4-7.\n\nSo for each quadrant, count the number of 8s and multiply by 2 to get the output values. Let's check Example 0:\n\nTop-left quadrant (rows 0-3, columns 0-3):\n\nLooking at rows 0-3:\n\nRow 0: [2,1,0,0] \u2192 no 8s.\n\nRow 1: [1,1,1,1] \u2192 no 8s.\n\nRow 2: [0,1,0,8] \u2192 one 8.\n\nRow 3: [0,1,8,8] \u2192 two 8s.\n\nTotal 8s: 1+2=3 \u2192 3*2=6. But in the output of Example 0, the third row is [0,0,6,0], which has a 6. Wait, maybe each quadrant's count is placed in a specific position in the output.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is a 4x4 grid where each cell corresponds to a quadrant, and the value is the sum of 8s in that quadrant multiplied by 2. So for Example 0's output:\n\nTop-left quadrant: 3 8s (1+2) \u2192 3*2=6 \u2192 but where is the 6 in the output? The third row of output has 6. Hmm. Maybe the quadrants are mapped in a different way.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking the corners of the input matrix. Let's check Example 0's input:\n\nCorners are:\n\nTop-left: 2 (row 0, col 0)\n\nTop-right: 3 (row 0, col 7)\n\nBottom-left:4 (row7, col0)\n\nBottom-right:6 (row7, col7)\n\nThen in the output, these numbers are present. For example, in Example 0's output:\n\nThe fourth row is [4,0,6,6]. The first element is 4 (bottom-left corner) and the third and fourth are 6 (bottom-right corner). The second row of the output has 2 and 3. So perhaps the output is arranged with the four corners in specific positions.\n\nBut how to form the entire output array. Let's see:\n\nExample 0's output is:\n\nRow 0: [0, 2, 0, 0]\n\nRow 1: [2, 2, 0, 3]\n\nRow 2: [0, 0, 6, 0]\n\nRow3: [4,0,6,6]\n\nSo the corners of the output might be:\n\nOutput's top-left corner is 0, top-right 0, but that's not matching. Hmm.\n\nAlternative approach: Let's look for the positions of the 8s in the input and how they relate to the output.\n\nIn Example 0, the third row of the input has an 8, the fourth row has two 8s, etc. The output has values like 6, which could be 3*2 (if 3 8s in a quadrant). Let's check quadrant counts.\n\nIn Example 0's input, the top-left quadrant (rows 0-3, cols 0-3):\n\nRow 0: no 8s.\n\nRow1: no 8s.\n\nRow2: column3 is 8 \u2192 1.\n\nRow3: columns2 and3 are 8 \u2192 2.\n\nTotal: 3 8s \u2192 3*2=6. So the output's third row, third column is 6. Wait, in output row2 (third row) is [0,0,6,0]. The 6 is in the third position. Maybe each quadrant's sum is placed in a specific position in the output.\n\nIf the quadrants are mapped to the output as follows:\n\nTop-left quadrant's count \u2192 output's [1][0] or [0][1]?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is built by considering the four corners of the input and the counts of 8s in each quadrant. Let's see:\n\nExample 0's output:\n\nThe first element of the output is 0, but the top-left corner of input is 2. The second element of the first row is 2. So maybe the output's first row is [top-left, top-right, ...], but the first row of the output is [0,2,0,0]. That doesn't fit. Alternatively, the output is combining the corner elements and the quadrant counts.\n\nAnother observation: The output arrays in the examples are smaller than the input arrays. For example, in Example 0, the input is 8x8 and the output is 4x4. So perhaps the output is formed by taking every other row and column, but that doesn't seem to fit.\n\nWait, looking at Example 1's input which is 6x6 and output is 2x2. So 6x6 input \u2192 2x2 output. So the output size is half the input's size. Similarly, Example 0's input is 8x8 \u2192 output 4x4. Example 2's input is 8x8 \u2192 output 4x4. So the output is (n/2)x(m/2) where n and m are the input dimensions. So the Test Input is 10x10 \u2192 output should be 5x5. But the examples' outputs have varying sizes. Wait, no. Example 1's input is 6 rows (each row has 6 elements), output is 2 rows. So 6/3=2, but that's not a direct relation. Alternatively, the output is formed by taking the first and last elements of certain rows and columns.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is created by taking the first and last rows of the input, and within those rows, taking the first and last elements, and then combining them. Let's check.\n\nIn Example 1's input:\n\nFirst row: [9,1,0,0,1,4] \u2192 first and last are 9 and4 \u2192 output's first row is [9,4].\n\nLast row: [2,1,0,0,1,3] \u2192 first and last are 2 and3 \u2192 but the output's second row is [2,0]. Hmm, this doesn't fit. So why is the second row's last element 0 instead of3? That's confusing.\n\nWait, maybe the output is formed by the first and last elements of the first and last rows, but only considering the outer perimeter of the input. For Example 1, the output is [9,4] and [2,0]. The 0 might come from another part. Alternatively, the 0 in the second row's second position could be from another row. Let me check the input's last row: [2,1,0,0,1,3]. The last element is 3. So why is the output's second row [2,0] instead of [2,3]?\n\nLooking at the Test Input, perhaps the pattern involves the numbers in the input that are not 1 or 8. Because in the input examples, the 1s are present in every row, perhaps as separators. For instance, the first and last rows have numbers at the start and end, and the middle rows have 1s in the first and last positions. So maybe the 1s form a border, and the numbers to consider are those outside the 1s.\n\nFor example, in Example 0's first row: [2,1,0,0,0,0,1,3]. The 1s are in positions 1 and 6. So the values before the first 1 (position0) is 2, and after the last 1 (position7) is3. Similarly, the last row has [4,1,...1,6]. So the first element is4, last is6. The output in Example 0 includes 2,3,4,6. Then in the middle rows, the 8s are counted. So perhaps the output combines the corner elements (before first 1 and after last 1 in first and last rows) and counts of 8s in certain regions.\n\nIn Example 0's output, the rows are:\n\n[0,2,0,0]\n\n[2,2,0,3]\n\n[0,0,6,0]\n\n[4,0,6,6]\n\nSo the 2 and 3 are from the first row's corners. 4 and6 from the last row's corners. The 6s are maybe counts of 8s. Let's see:\n\nFor Example 0's output, the third row is [4,0,6,6]. The 4 is from the last row's first element, and the 6s might be the sum of 8s in the lower quadrants. Let's check the count of 8s in the lower quadrants.\n\nThe input's lower quadrants (rows 4-7, columns 0-3 and 4-7):\n\nLooking at rows4-7, columns0-3:\n\nRow4: [0,1,0,0] \u2192 no 8s.\n\nRow5: [0,1,8,0] \u2192 one 8.\n\nRow6: [1,1,1,1] \u2192 no 8s.\n\nRow7: [4,1,0,0] \u2192 no 8s.\n\nTotal 8s: 1 \u2192 multiplied by 2 gives 2. But in the output, the third row has 6. Hmm, maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output's elements are formed by taking the corner elements and the count of 8s in the four quadrants. For example:\n\nTop-left corner, top-right corner, bottom-left, bottom-right. Then for each quadrant, count 8s and multiply by 2.\n\nSo for Example 0:\n\nTop-left quadrant 8 count: 3 (rows 2 and3 in columns2-3) \u2192 3*2=6.\n\nTop-right quadrant (columns4-7, rows0-3):\n\nRow0: 0,0,0,0 \u2192 no 8s.\n\nRow1: 1,1,1,1 \u2192 no.\n\nRow2:0,0,1,0 \u2192 no.\n\nRow3:0,8,1,0 \u2192 in columns4-7, row3's elements are 0,8,0,0 \u2192 one 8. So total 1 \u2192 2.\n\nSo top-right quadrant count is 1*2=2.\n\nBottom-left quadrant (rows4-7, columns0-3):\n\nRow4:0,1,0,0 \u2192 no.\n\nRow5:0,1,8,0 \u2192 one 8.\n\nRow6:1,1,1,1 \u2192 no.\n\nRow7:4,1,0,0 \u2192 no.\n\nTotal 8s:1 \u2192 2.\n\nBottom-right quadrant (rows4-7, columns4-7):\n\nRow4:8,0,1,0 \u2192 columns4-7 are 0,1,0 \u2192 wait, row4 is [0,1,0,0,8,0,1,0] \u2192 columns4-7 are 8,0,1,0. So 8 is present once.\n\nRow5:0,8,1,0 \u2192 columns4-7: 8,1,0 \u2192 one 8.\n\nRow6:1,1,1,1 \u2192 no.\n\nRow7:0,0,1,6 \u2192 columns4-7: 0,0,1,6 \u2192 no 8s.\n\nTotal 8s: 2 \u2192 4.\n\nSo the quadrant counts would be:\n\nTop-left:3\u21926, Top-right:1\u21922, Bottom-left:1\u21922, Bottom-right:2\u21924.\n\nThen, the output would somehow combine the corners and these counts. But how?\n\nThe output of Example 0 has:\n\nFirst row: [0,2,0,0]\n\nSecond row: [2,2,0,3]\n\nThird row: [0,0,6,0]\n\nFourth row: [4,0,6,6]\n\nThe 6s appear in the third and fourth rows. The top-right quadrant count is 2 (from 1*2) \u2192 maybe placed in the first row's second position (2). The top-left count is 6 (from 3*2) \u2192 placed in third row's third position. The bottom-left count is 2 \u2192 maybe in third row's first position (0?), but not matching. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the output is arranged as follows:\n\nThe four corners of the input matrix are placed in the four corners of the output matrix. Then, the quadrant counts are placed in the corresponding positions.\n\nFor Example 0, the input corners are:\n\nTop-left:2 (row0, col0)\n\nTop-right:3 (row0, col7)\n\nBottom-left:4 (row7, col0)\n\nBottom-right:6 (row7, col7)\n\nThe quadrant counts (multiplied by 2) are:\n\nTop-left:6\n\nTop-right:2\n\nBottom-left:2\n\nBottom-right:4\n\nSo arranging these:\n\nOutput corners would be:\n\nTop-left:2 \u2192 but output's first row starts with 0.\n\nHmm, not sure. Alternatively, the output's elements are the sum of the corner elements and the quadrant counts. For example, the first element of the output could be the top-left corner plus the top-left quadrant count, but 2+6=8 which isn't in the output.\n\nAnother angle: Looking at the output arrays, each row in the output has elements that are either the corners of the input or the counts of 8s. For example, in Example 0's output, the second row is [2,2,0,3]. The 2 could be the top-left corner, the 3 the top-right. The middle elements could be counts. But 2 is also present in the first row.\n\nAlternatively, the output is formed by taking the first and last elements of each row in the input, but only for certain rows. For example, in Example 0's input, the first and last rows have non-1 elements at the start and end. The output's first row has 2 and 3 (from the first input row), and the last row has 4 and6 (from the last input row). The middle rows of the output might relate to the counts of 8s in the middle rows of the input.\n\nIn Example 0's output, the third row has 6, which could be the count of 8s multiplied by 2. Let's count the 8s in the entire input for Example 0. The input has rows 2,3,4,5 which contain 8s.\n\nRow2: [0,1,0,8,0,0,1,0] \u2192 one 8.\n\nRow3: [0,1,8,8,0,8,1,0] \u2192 three 8s.\n\nRow4: [0,1,0,0,8,0,1,0] \u2192 one 8.\n\nRow5: [0,1,8,0,8,8,1,0] \u2192 three 8s.\n\nTotal 8s: 1+3+1+3 =8. 8*2=16. But the output has a total of 6+6+6+3+2+4+... Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the output is constructed by layers. The first and last rows of the input provide the first and last rows of the output. The middle rows of the output are derived from the middle rows of the input, counting 8s.\n\nIn Example 0's output, the first row is [0,2,0,0]. The 2 is the first element of the first input row. The last output row is [4,0,6,6]. 4 is the first element of the last input row, and 6 is the last element of the last input row. The middle rows of the output might involve the counts of 8s in the corresponding rows of the input.\n\nBut Example 0's input has 8 rows. The output has 4 rows. So maybe each output row corresponds to two input rows. For example, output row0 corresponds to input row0 and row1. But how?\n\nAlternatively, the output is formed by taking every other row, starting from the first and last, and then processing them. For example, the first output row is made from the first input row, the second output row from the third input row, etc., but this isn't clear.\n\nLet me think about Example 1's output. The input is 6x6, output is 2x2. So for each quadrant in the input (divided into 3x3 sections?), but not sure. The output is [9,4] and [2,0]. The 9 and4 are from the first input row's first and last elements. The 2 is from the last row's first element, but the 0 is from somewhere else. The last input row's last element is3, but the output has0. So maybe the 0 is the count of 8s in certain areas.\n\nIn Example1's input, the middle rows have 8s:\n\nRow2: [0,1,8,8,1,0]\n\nRow3: [0,1,8,0,1,0]\n\nSo row2 has two 8s, row3 has one 8. Total 3 \u2192 3*2=6, but the output has 0. Not sure.\n\nWait, in Example1's output, the second row is [2,0]. The input's last row is [2,1,0,0,1,3]. The last element is3, but the output's second row has0. Maybe the 0 is the count of 8s in the lower part of the input. Let's see:\n\nThe input has 6 rows. The lower part (rows3-5):\n\nRow3: [0,1,8,0,1,0] \u2192 one 8.\n\nRow4: [1,1,1,1,1,1] \u2192 no.\n\nRow5: [2,1,0,0,1,3] \u2192 no.\n\nTotal 8s:1 \u2192 2. But output's second row is [2,0]. Maybe 2 is the count of 8s in the lower left quadrant and 0 is the lower right. But this is getting too speculative.\n\nAlternative approach: Look for the output elements' positions. In Example0's output, the elements are 2,3,4,6 (the corners of input) and 6,6, etc. So maybe the output is a combination of the four corners and the counts of 8s in each quadrant multiplied by 2.\n\nSo, each quadrant's count of 8s multiplied by 2 becomes a value in the output. The corners are placed in the output's corners, and the quadrant counts fill the other positions.\n\nFor Example0:\n\nQuadrants:\n\nTop-left:3 8s \u21926 \u2192 placed in output's [1][0], [2][2], etc. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the output is a 4x4 matrix where each cell corresponds to a quadrant. For example, each quadrant of the input is processed into a single cell in the output. So the top-left quadrant of the input is processed into the top-left cell of the output, etc.\n\nProcessing could be summing the 8s in the quadrant and multiplying by 2. Let's check:\n\nExample0's input top-left quadrant (rows0-3, cols0-3):\n\nRows0: [2,1,0,0] \u2192 no 8s.\n\nRow1: [1,1,1,1] \u2192 no.\n\nRow2: [0,1,0,8] \u2192 one 8.\n\nRow3: [0,1,8,8] \u2192 two 8s.\n\nTotal:3 \u2192 3*2=6. So the top-left quadrant would map to 6 in the output's top-left cell. But Example0's output's top-left cell is 0. Hmm, not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking the corners of the input and then the sum of 8s in each quadrant multiplied by 2, arranged in a certain way. For example:\n\nThe output has the four corners in its corners, and the sum of 8s in the quadrants in the other positions.\n\nBut in Example0's output, the corners are 0,0,0,0, which doesn't fit.\n\nAnother idea: The output is created by taking the first and last elements of each row in the input, but only for the rows that start and end with non-1 values. For example, the first and last rows of the input start and end with non-1 (2,3 in first row,4,6 in last row). The middle rows start and end with 0 or other numbers. So perhaps the output's rows are formed by the first and last elements of these rows, and for the middle rows, it's the count of 8s multiplied by 2.\n\nBut in Example0's input, the rows with non-1 start and end are rows 0 and7. So output rows 0 and3 would be based on them. The other rows of the output (1 and2) might be based on the middle rows. For example:\n\nRow0 of output: [0,2,0,0] \u2192 maybe 0 from somewhere, but the first and last elements are 2 and3. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the output rows are the first and last elements of the input's first and last rows, and the counts of 8s in the input's middle rows. For Example0's output:\n\nFirst output row is [0,2,0,0]. Maybe 2 is the second element, but this isn't clear.\n\nAnother observation: In all examples, the input has a structure where the first and last rows start and end with certain numbers, and the middle rows are surrounded by 1s and contain 0s and 8s. The output seems to take the corner numbers from the first and last rows and possibly the counts of 8s in the middle sections.\n\nFor example, Example0's output first row: 2 is the first element of the input's first row. The output's last row starts with 4, which is the first element of the input's last row. The output's last element of the last row is6, which is the last element of the input's last row. The middle rows of the output have numbers that could be related to the counts of 8s.\n\nSo perhaps the output is constructed as follows:\n\n- The first row of the output is formed by the first and last elements of the input's first row, and the first and last elements of the second row. But not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the output is a combination of the perimeter elements and the 8 counts. The perimeter elements are the first and last elements of each row and column, but this is getting too vague.\n\nAnother approach: Let's look for the positions of numbers in the output and see where they appear in the input.\n\nIn Example0's output:\n\nRow1: [2,2,0,3]\n\nThe two 2s could be from the first element of the input's first row (2) and the second 2 from somewhere else. The 3 is the last element of the first row.\n\nRow3: [4,0,6,6]. The 4 is first element of last row, and the two 6s are from the last element of the last row.\n\nThe 0s and other numbers might be counts of 8s.\n\nBut this doesn't fully explain the pattern.\n\nWait, maybe the output is formed by taking the first and last elements of the first and last rows (corners of the input), and then the sum of 8s in each quadrant multiplied by 2. These sums are placed in the remaining positions.\n\nFor Example0's output:\n\nCorners are 2 (top-left),3 (top-right),4 (bottom-left),6 (bottom-right). The output's corners would then be these values. Let's check:\n\nExample0's output:\n\nRow0: [0,2,0,0] \u2192 top-left corner is 0, but input's is2. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternative idea: The output is a 4x4 matrix where each cell is the sum of the input's corresponding cell and its neighbors. But this is too vague.\n\nAnother possibility: The input is divided into 2x2 blocks, and each block is transformed into a single value in the output. For example, the maximum value in the block or the sum.\n\nFor Example0's input:\n\nFirst two rows:\n\nRow0: 2,1,0,0,0,0,1,3\n\nRow1:1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1\n\nDivided into 2x2 blocks:\n\nFirst block (rows0-1, cols0-1):\n\n2,1\n\n1,1\n\nSum: 2+1+1+1=5. Not sure how this becomes 0 in the output.\n\nAlternatively, take the sum of non-zero and non-1 elements. In this block, non-1 elements are 2. Sum is 2. But the output's first element is0.\n\nAlternatively, look for 8s. But in this block, there are none. So maybe the value is 0. The next block would be cols2-3, rows0-1:\n\n0,0\n\n1,1 \u2192 sum of non-1 elements:0. So output element 0. This matches the first row of output [0,2,...].\n\nHmm, maybe each 2x2 block is reduced to the sum of 8s in it multiplied by 2. But in this case, the first block has no 8s. So 0. The second block also has no 8s. So 0. But the output's first row has a 2. So not matching.\n\nAlternatively, the output is formed by taking the elements from the input's even and odd rows and columns in a certain way. Not sure.\n\nAnother angle: Looking at Example1's input and output:\n\nInput first row: [9,1,0,0,1,4]\n\nOutput first row: [9,4]. These are the first and last elements of the input's first row.\n\nInput last row: [2,1,0,0,1,3]\n\nOutput last row: [2,0]. The first element is2, but the last is0 instead of3. Why?\n\nLooking at the input's last row, the elements are [2,1,0,0,1,3]. The first and last elements are2 and3. The output's last row is [2,0]. The 0 is confusing. Maybe it's related to the count of 8s in the last row. But there are no 8s in the last row of input. So why 0?\n\nAlternatively, the output's last row is formed by taking the first element of the last input row and the first element of the penultimate input row. For Example1's input, the penultimate row is [1,1,1,1,1,1], so first element is1. But output's last row is [2,0]. Not matching.\n\nAlternatively, the output's second element in the last row is the count of 8s in the last column. For Example1's input, the last column of each row:\n\nRow0:4\n\nRow1:1\n\nRow2:0\n\nRow3:0\n\nRow4:1\n\nRow5:3\n\nNo 8s here, so count is0. So the second element of the output's last row is0. This explains Example1's output [2,0]. So the first element is the first element of the last input row (2), and the second element is the count of 8s in the last column (0). \n\nFor Example0's input, the last column:\n\nRow0:3\n\nRow1:1\n\nRow2:0\n\nRow3:0\n\nRow4:0\n\nRow5:0\n\nRow6:1\n\nRow7:6\n\nNo 8s in the last column, count is0. So if this were the case, Example0's output should have 0 in some position. But Example0's output has3 in the first row's last element. Hmm. So this might not be the pattern.\n\nWait, but Example1's output's second element is0, which matches the count of 8s in the last column. Example0's output's last element of the first row is0, which matches the count of 8s in the last column (0). But the third element of the first row is0, but the last column's count is0. So maybe each output element is formed by combining the first/last elements of rows and the count of 8s in certain columns.\n\nThis is getting too complicated. Let's try to find a pattern that fits all examples.\n\nIn all examples, the output's first row has the first and last elements of the input's first row. The output's last row has the first and last elements of the input's last row. The middle rows of the output have counts of 8s in certain regions.\n\nFor Example0's output:\n\nFirst row: [0,2,0,0]\n\nBut input's first row starts with2 and ends with3. So why is the output's first row [0,2,0,0]? Maybe the output's first row is the first and last elements of the input's first row, and the first and last elements of the second row. The input's second row is all 1s, so first and last elements are1. But the output's first row starts with0 and has2. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAnother possibility: The output is formed by taking the first and last elements of the first and last rows, and the middle rows are sums of 8s in the corresponding rows of the input.\n\nFor Example0's input has 8 rows. The output has4 rows. So each output row corresponds to two input rows. For example:\n\nOutput row0: input rows0 and1 \u2192 sum 8s in these rows.\n\nRow0 and1 of input have no 8s, so sum is0 \u2192 output row0 is [0,0,0,0], but the actual output is [0,2,0,0]. Not matching.\n\nHmm. This is tricky. Let's look at Example2's input and output.\n\nExample2's input is an 8x8 grid. The output is 4x4.\n\nOutput rows:\n\n[0,6,0,2]\n\n[6,6,2,0]\n\n[7,0,4,4]\n\n[7,7,4,0]\n\nLooking at the input's first row: [6,1,0,0,0,0,1,2]. So first element6, last element2. The output's first row starts with0 and ends with2. The last row of input is [7,1,0,0,0,0,1,4]. First element7, last4. The output's third row starts with7 and has4 twice.\n\nThe output's first row has 6 and2, which are the first and last elements of the input's first row, but they are in the second and fourth positions. The output's third row has7 and4, which are the first and last elements of the input's last row. \n\nExample2's output:\n\nRow0: [0,6,0,2]\n\nRow1: [6,6,2,0]\n\nRow2: [7,0,4,4]\n\nRow3: [7,7,4,0]\n\nSo the 6 and2 from the first row of input are in row0's second and fourth positions. The 7 and4 from the last row of input are in row2's first and third positions. The middle rows (1 and3) have 6s, 2s, etc., which might be related to counts of 8s in certain regions.\n\nThis suggests that the output combines the first and last elements of the first and last rows of the input, placed in specific positions, and the middle elements are counts of 8s in certain regions multiplied by 2.\n\nFor Example2's input, the output's row0 is [0,6,0,2]. The 6 is the first element of the input's first row, and 2 is the last. The zeros might be counts of 8s in specific areas. Let's check how many 8s are in the first two rows of the input. The first two rows are:\n\nRow0: no 8s.\n\nRow1: all 1s.\n\nSo counts are0. So 0*2=0. That matches the first element of row0's output.\n\nThe 6 and2 are in positions1 and3 of row0. So perhaps the first row of the output contains the first and last elements of the input's first row in the middle positions, and the counts of 8s in the first and last positions.\n\nBut row0's first position is0, which would be the count of 8s in the first quadrant. But as before, the first quadrant has no 8s. So 0.\n\nSo perhaps each output row is constructed as follows:\n\n- For even-numbered output rows (0,2), the elements are the first and last of the corresponding input rows, and the counts of 8s in certain areas.\n\n- For odd-numbered output rows (1,3), the elements are derived from the counts of 8s in other areas.\n\nBut this is speculative.\n\nAnother observation: In Example0's output, the numbers 2,3,4,6 appear, which are the corners of the input. The numbers 6 and others might be sums of 8s in certain regions. For example, the 6 in Example0's output could be 3*2=6, where there are three 8s in a quadrant. Similarly, in Example2's output, the 6s and 2s could be counts of 8s multiplied by 2.\n\nSo perhaps the pattern is:\n\n- The output's corners are the corners of the input.\n\n- The other elements in the output are the counts of 8s in the corresponding quadrants multiplied by 2.\n\nBut Example0's output doesn't fit this. The output's top-left corner should be2, but it's0. So maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, the output is a transformation where the first and last elements of each input row are taken, and the 8s are counted and multiplied by 2, arranged in a specific way.\n\nFor example, in Example0's input:\n\nFirst row: [2,1,0,0,0,0,1,3]. Take 2 and3.\n\nSecond row: [1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1]. No non-1 elements.\n\nMiddle rows: count 8s.\n\nLast row: [4,1,0,0,0,0,1,6]. Take4 and6.\n\nSo output's first row is [2,3], and last row is [4,6]. But Example0's output has four rows, so this isn't matching.\n\nWait, Example0's output has four rows. So perhaps the output is formed by taking the first and last elements of the first and last rows, and the counts of 8s in the remaining rows arranged in some way.\n\nBut I'm not making progress. Let me try to find a different approach.\n\nLooking at the Test Input:\n\nIt's a 10x10 grid. The first row is [3,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,4]. Last row is [7,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,5]. The middle rows have 1s at the start and end, and 8s in between.\n\nIf the pattern is that the output's first row takes the first and last elements of the input's first row (3 and4), and the last row takes the first and last elements of the input's last row (7 and5), and the middle rows count the 8s in certain regions multiplied by2, then the output might look like:\n\n[3,4]\n\n[..., ...]\n\n[7,5]\n\nBut the examples show more complex outputs. For example, Example0's output has four rows, not just two. So this is likely not the case.\n\nAnother possible pattern: The output is formed by taking the first and last elements of each even-numbered row in the input. For Example0's input, which has 8 rows, even rows are 0,2,4,6. Their first and last elements are:\n\nRow0:2,3\n\nRow2:0,0\n\nRow4:0,0\n\nRow6:1,1.\n\nBut Example0's output doesn't match this.\n\nAlternatively, the output is formed by taking the first and last elements of each row that starts and ends with non-1 elements. For Example0's input, only rows0 and7 qualify. So output would have two rows. But Example0's output has four rows, so this is incorrect.\n\nAnother observation: In all examples, the input's middle rows are surrounded by 1s and contain 8s and 0s. The output's middle rows have numbers that are multiples of 2 (0,2,6,4, etc.), which could be counts of 8s multiplied by 2.\n\nSo perhaps the output is constructed by:\n\n1. Taking the first and last elements of the input's first and last rows and placing them in the output's first and last rows.\n\n2. For the middle rows of the output, calculate the count of 8s in each corresponding row of the input and multiply by 2.\n\nBut let's check:\n\nExample0's input has 8 rows. Output has4 rows. So each output row corresponds to two input rows. For example:\n\nOutput row0: input row0 and1 \u2192 first elements:2 and1 \u2192 output row0's first element is2 (from input row0). But output row0 is [0,2,0,0]. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternative idea: The output's first and last elements are the first and last elements of the input's first and last rows, and the middle elements are the count of 8s in each column multiplied by 2. For example, in Example1's input, the first output row is [9,4], which are the first and last elements of the first input row. The second output row is [2,0], which are the first and last elements of the last input row. The 0 could be the count of 8s in the last column. But in Example1's input, the last column has no 8s, hence 0.\n\nExample0's input last column has no 8s, so the last element of the output's first row would be0 (which it is). The first element of the output's first row is2, which is the first element of the input's first row. The last element of the output's last row is6, which is the last element of the input's last row.\n\nSo perhaps the output's structure is:\n\nFor each of the first and last input rows, take their first and last elements. For the output's first row, take the first and last elements of the first input row. For the output's last row, take the first and last elements of the last input row. The middle rows of the output are the counts of 8s in the corresponding columns, multiplied by2.\n\nBut Example0's output has four rows. Let's check:\n\nFirst output row: [0,2,0,0]\n\nSecond row: [2,2,0,3]\n\nThird row: [0,0,6,0]\n\nFourth row: [4,0,6,6]\n\nThe first and last elements of the first input row are2 and3. The first and last elements of the last input row are4 and6.\n\nBut the output's first row has0,2,0,0. The second row has2,2,0,3. The third row has0,0,6,0. The fourth row has4,0,6,6.\n\nIt seems that the output's rows are alternating between taking elements from the first and last input rows and counting 8s. For example:\n\nOutput row0: first input row's first and last elements (2 and3) are placed in positions1 and3. The zeros in positions0 and2 could be the counts of 8s in the first and third columns of the input's first two rows.\n\nBut let's calculate:\n\nFor Example0's input:\n\nFirst two rows (0 and1):\n\nColumns0: 2,1 \u2192 no 8s.\n\nColumns3:0,1 \u2192 no 8s.\n\nSo counts are0. Multiplied by2 \u21920. So output row0: [0,2,0,3], but actual output row0 is [0,2,0,0]. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, the positions in the output correspond to the columns of the input. For example, output row0's elements are the counts of 8s in columns0-1, 2-3, 4-5, 6-7 of the first two input rows, multiplied by2.\n\nFor Example0's first two rows:\n\nColumns0-1:\n\nRow0:2,1 \u2192 no 8s.\n\nRow1:1,1 \u2192 no 8s.\n\nTotal:0 \u21920.\n\nColumns2-3:\n\nRow0:0,0 \u2192 no.\n\nRow1:1,1 \u2192 no.\n\nTotal:0 \u21920.\n\nColumns4-5:\n\nRow0:0,0 \u2192 no.\n\nRow1:1,1 \u2192 no.\n\nTotal:0 \u21920.\n\nColumns6-7:\n\nRow0:1,3 \u2192 no 8s.\n\nRow1:1,1 \u2192 no.\n\nTotal:0 \u21920.\n\nSo output row0 would be [0,0,0,0], but the actual is [0,2,0,0]. So this isn't right.\n\nThis is really challenging. Let's look for another angle.\n\nIn Example0's output, the numbers 2,3,4,6 appear as the corners of the input. The middle numbers like6 could be the sum of 8s multiplied by2. Let's count all 8s in Example0's input:\n\nRows2-5:\n\nRow2:1 8.\n\nRow3:3 8s.\n\nRow4:1 8.\n\nRow5:3 8s.\n\nTotal:1+3+1+3=8 \u21928*2=16. But the output's sum of all elements is0+2+0+0 +2+2+0+3 +0+0+6+0 +4+0+6+6= 2+2+2+3+6+4+6+6= 29. Not matching.\n\nBut individual output elements could be 6, like in Example0's output third row:6. Which is 3*2=6. So maybe each output element corresponds to a row or a group of rows in the input.\n\nIn Example0's input, row2 has1 8, row3 has3, row4 has1, row5 has3. The output has elements6 (3*2) and others. So maybe each output row corresponds to a pair of input rows, summing their 8s and multiplying by2. For example:\n\nOutput row0 corresponds to input rows0 and1 (no 8s) \u21920.\n\nOutput row1 corresponds to rows2 and3:1+3=4 \u21924*2=8. But in the output row1, there are 2 and3. Not matching.\n\nAlternatively, each output row corresponds to two input rows, but the sum is placed in specific positions. For example, the 8s in rows2 and3 are4 \u21924*2=8. But output row1 has2 and3. Not sure.\n\nAnother idea: The output is formed by taking the first and last elements of the input's first and last rows, and the rest of the elements are the counts of 8s in each column multiplied by2.\n\nFor Example1's input:\n\nFirst row first element9, last4. Last row first2, last3. Output first row[9,4], last row[2,0]. The0 could be the count of 8s in the last column. Let's check the last column of Example1's input:\n\nRow0:4\n\nRow1:1\n\nRow2:0\n\nRow3:0\n\nRow4:1\n\nRow5:3\n\nNo 8s \u21920. So output's last row's last element is0. This fits.\n\nFor Example0's input, the last column has no 8s, so the output's first row's last element would be0 (which it is in Example0's output first row).\n\nSo perhaps the pattern is:\n\nFor each output row:\n\n- The first element is the first element of the corresponding input row.\n\n- The last element is the last element of the corresponding input row.\n\n- The middle elements are the count of 8s in the corresponding column(s) multiplied by2.\n\nBut in Example0's output, the rows are four, which would correspond to four input rows. But the input has eight rows. So maybe each output row corresponds to two input rows. For example, output row0 corresponds to input rows0 and1, output row1 to rows2 and3, etc.\n\nLet's test this for Example0:\n\nOutput row0: input rows0 and1.\n\nFirst element of row0:2 (input row0's first element).\n\nLast element of row1:1 (input row1's last element). But output row0's last element is0. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, output row0's first element is the first element of input row0, and the last element is the last element of input row0. The middle elements are the counts of 8s in the corresponding columns for rows0 and1.\n\nFor Example0's output row0: [0,2,0,0].\n\n- First element: input row0's first element is2. But output's first element is0. Doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. I'm stuck. Maybe I should look for a different pattern.\n\nLooking at the output dimensions:\n\nExample0: input 8x8 \u2192 output4x4.\n\nExample1: input6x6 \u2192 output2x2.\n\nExample2: input8x8 \u2192 output4x4.\n\nSo the output size is input size divided by2 in each dimension. So for the Test Input which is10x10, the output should be5x5.\n\nBut how is the output generated? Perhaps by taking every other element from the input.\n\nBut in Example0's input, the first row is[2,1,0,0,0,0,1,3]. Taking every other element would give [2,0,0,1], but the output's first row is[0,2,0,0]. Not matching.\n\nAlternative idea: The output is a result of some convolution or matrix operation. For example, each output cell is the sum of 2x2 blocks in the input, multiplied by certain weights.\n\nBut without knowing the weights, this is hard to determine.\n\nAnother possible clue: The numbers in the output are all present in the input, except for those that are multiples of 2, which could be counts of 8s multiplied by2. For example, in Example0's output, the 6s are not present in the input but are 3*2 (3 8s in a quadrant).\n\nSo combining this with the input's first and last elements in certain positions:\n\nThe output is a matrix where:\n\n- The corners are the input's corners.\n\n- The other elements are counts of 8s in specific regions multiplied by2.\n\nFor Example0:\n\nCorners:2 (top-left),3 (top-right),4 (bottom-left),6 (bottom-right).\n\nOutput corners:\n\n- Top-left:0 \u2192 not matching.\n\nHmm, not helpful.\n\nAnother approach: Let's see if the output is a transformed version of the input, where each 8 is replaced by 2, and then summed in certain ways.\n\nFor Example0's input, replacing each 8 with 2 and summing rows or columns.\n\nBut I'm not seeing a direct correlation.\n\nAlternatively, the output is created by taking the sum of each 2x2 block in the input, where 8s are counted as 2 and others as their face value.\n\nFor Example0's first 2x2 block (rows0-1, cols0-1):\n\n2,1\n\n1,1\n\nSum:2+1+1+1=5. But output's first element is0. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, sum only the 8s, counting each as 2.\n\nBut in this block, no 8s. So sum is0. Output's first element is0. Which matches Example0's first element.\n\nNext block (rows0-1, cols2-3):\n\n0,0\n\n1,1\n\nNo 8s. Sum0 \u2192 output's next element is2. Doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. Not matching.\n\nAnother possibility: The output is formed by taking the sum of 8s in each 2x2 block, multiplied by2. So for each 2x2 block in the input, count the 8s and multiply by2 to get the output value.\n\nFor Example0's input:\n\nFirst 2x2 block (rows0-1, cols0-1): no 8s \u21920.\n\nNext block (cols2-3): no 8s \u21920.\n\nNext (cols4-5): no \u21920.\n\nNext (cols6-7): no \u21920.\n\nSo output row0 would be [0,0,0,0]. But Example0's output row0 is [0,2,0,0]. So this doesn't fit.\n\nBut in Example0's input, there are 8s in rows2-5. Let's check a block there.\n\nBlock rows2-3, cols2-3:\n\nRow2:0,8\n\nRow3:8,8\n\nCount of 8s:3 \u21923*2=6. Which could correspond to the output's third row third element being6.\n\nYes, in Example0's output, the third row has6 in the third position. So perhaps each output cell corresponds to a 2x2 block in the input, and the value is the count of 8s multiplied by2.\n\nExample0's input is8x8, divided into 4x4 2x2 blocks. So each output cell is a 2x2 block's 8 count *2.\n\nFor example:\n\nOutput cell (0,0) corresponds to the top-left 2x2 block (rows0-1, cols0-1): 0 8s \u21920.\n\nOutput cell (0,1): block cols2-3, rows0-1:0 \u21920.\n\nOutput cell (0,2): cols4-5, rows0-1:0 \u21920.\n\nOutput cell (0,3): cols6-7, rows0-1:0 \u21920.\n\nSo output row0: [0,0,0,0]. But the actual output row0 is [0,2,0,0]. Doesn't match.\n\nBut if we consider overlapping blocks or a different division, maybe. Alternatively, the input is divided into 2x2 blocks, and the output is the count of 8s in each block multiplied by2. But this would give a 4x4 output for an 8x8 input. Let's check:\n\nExample0's input has 8x8 rows, divided into 2x2 blocks \u2192 4x4 blocks. For each block, count 8s and multiply by2.\n\nBlock (0,0): rows0-1, cols0-1 \u2192 no 8s \u21920.\n\nBlock (0,1): cols2-3, rows0-1 \u21920.\n\nBlock (0,2): cols4-5 \u21920.\n\nBlock (0,3): cols6-7 \u21920.\n\nSo output row0 is [0,0,0,0]. But actual output row0 is [0,2,0,0]. So this doesn't fit.\n\nBut block (1,0): rows2-3, cols0-1:\n\nRow2:0,1\n\nRow3:0,1 \u2192 no 8s \u21920.\n\nBlock (1,1): cols2-3:\n\nRow2:0,8\n\nRow3:8,8 \u2192 three 8s \u21923*2=6. This would correspond to output cell (1,1) being6. But in Example0's output, the third row has6 in the third position. So this doesn't align.\n\nAlternatively, the blocks are non-overlapping and arranged in a different way. For Example0's input, rows are divided into 4 pairs of 2 rows each. Each output row corresponds to two input rows.\n\nBut this still doesn't explain the output's structure.\n\nAt this point, I'm struggling to find a clear pattern. Perhaps I should look for a different approach. Let's look for the positions of the numbers in the output and see if they match certain patterns.\n\nIn Example0's output:\n\n[0,2,0,0]\n[2,2,0,3]\n[0,0,6,0]\n[4,0,6,6]\n\nThe 2 appears in the first and second rows. The 3 is in the first row's last element. The 4 and6 are in the last row. The 6s are in the third and fourth rows.\n\nThe input's first row starts with2 and ends with3. The last row starts with4 and ends with6. The 8s are in the middle rows. The 6s in the output could be counts of 8s in certain regions.\n\nFor example, in Example0's input, the third row (row3) has two 8s. The fourth row has one 8. Row5 has three 8s. So summing these could give totals that when multiplied by2 appear in the output.\n\nAnother observation: The output's dimensions are (n-2)/2 x (m-2)/2, where n and m are the input's rows and columns. For Example0, (8-2)/2=3 \u2192 no, but output is4x4. Doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, the output is the input's dimensions divided by2. 8/2=4, so 4x4.\n\nSo each output cell corresponds to a 2x2 block in the input.\n\nLet's consider that the output cell is the sum of the 8s in the corresponding 2x2 block, multiplied by2.\n\nExample0's input:\n\nRow2: [0,1,0,8,0,0,1,0]\n\nRow3: [0,1,8,8,0,8,1,0]\n\nRow4: [0,1,0,0,8,0,1,0]\n\nRow5: [0,1,8,0,8,8,1,0]\n\nSo for the 2x2 block starting at row2, col2:\n\nElements:\n\nrow2 col2:0\n\nrow2 col3:8\n\nrow3 col2:8\n\nrow3 col3:8\n\nCount of 8s:3 \u21923*2=6. This would be output cell (1,1) (assuming zero-based indexing). Looking at Example0's output, the third row third element is6. So maybe the output cell (2,2) is6. But the output's third row is [0,0,6,0], so third column, third row (index2) is6. This aligns.\n\nAnother block in row2, col4:\n\nrow2 col4:0\n\nrow2 col5:0\n\nrow3 col4:0\n\nrow3 col5:8 \u2192 count is1 \u21922.\n\nSo output cell (1,2) would be2. Example0's output row1 is [2,2,0,3]. The third element is0. Doesn't match.\n\nHmm. This approach might be correct for some cells but not others.\n\nAlternatively, the output cell (i,j) corresponds to the sum of 8s in the input's rows 2i and 2i+1, columns 2j and 2j+1. Multiply the count by2.\n\nFor Example0's output cell (0,0):\n\n rows0-1, cols0-1: no 8s \u21920.\n\n output cell (0,0) is0. Which matches.\n\n cell (0,1): rows0-1, cols2-3: no 8s \u21920. output is0.\n\n cell (0,2): rows0-1, cols4-5: no 8s \u21920. output is0.\n\n cell (0,3): rows0-1, cols6-7: no 8s \u21920. output is0. But Example0's output row0 is [0,2,0,0]. So cell (0,1) is2, which doesn't match.\n\nSo this approach doesn't fit.\n\nBut maybe the output cell (i,j) is the sum of 8s in the input's row i+1 and column j+1. For example, output cell (0,1) would be the sum of 8s in row1 and column2. But this doesn't make sense.\n\nAlternatively, the output cell (i,j) is the sum of 8s in the input's row i*2+1 and column j*2+1. For Example0's output cell (0,1) would be row1, column3. Input row1, column3 is1 \u2192 no 8s. So output cell (0,1) is0. But Example0's output cell (0,1) is2.\n\nThis is not working.\n\nAt this point, given the time I've spent and the lack of progress, I'll try to hypothesize the pattern based on the examples:\n\nThe output is formed by taking the first and last elements of the first and last input rows and placing them in specific positions in the output, while the middle elements are the count of 8s in each quadrant multiplied by2.\n\nFor example:\n\n- The first row of the output contains the first and last elements of the first input row, and the counts of 8s in certain regions.\n\n- The last row of the output contains the first and last elements of the last input row, and counts of 8s.\n\n- The middle rows of the output are counts of 8s in the corresponding middle rows of the input.\n\nApplying this to the Test Input:\n\nTest Input is 10x10.\n\nFirst row: [3,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,4]\n\nLast row: [7,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,5]\n\nMiddle rows have 8s.\n\nThe output should be a 5x5 matrix. But the examples' outputs vary. Let's look at how the examples' outputs are structured.\n\nExample0's output is 4x4:\n\n- First row: [0,2,0,0] \u2192 2 is the first element of input's first row.\n\n- Second row: [2,2,0,3] \u21923 is the last element of input's first row.\n\n- Third row: [0,0,6,0] \u21926 is count of 8s in a quadrant.\n\n- Fourth row: [4,0,6,6] \u21924 is first element of last input row,6 is last element.\n\nExample2's output:\n\nFirst row: [0,6,0,2] \u21926 and2 are first and last of input's first row.\n\nLast row: [7,7,4,0] \u21927 and5 are first and last of last input row? But output's last row has4 and0. Hmm.\n\nThis suggests that the output's first and last rows are formed from the input's first and last rows' first and last elements, and the middle rows are counts of 8s in the quadrants.\n\nFor the Test Input, the output's first row should include 3 (first element of first row) and4 (last element of first row). The last row should include7 and5. The middle rows would be counts of 8s in the quadrants multiplied by2.\n\nBut I'm not confident. Given the time constraints, I'll proceed to hypothesize the output for the Test Input based on the examples, especially Example0 and Example2.\n\nThe Test Input's first row is [3,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,4]. The first element is3, last is4. The last row is [7,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,5]. First element7, last5.\n\nThe middle rows (rows2-7) contain 8s. Counting the 8s in each quadrant:\n\nAssuming the input is divided into four quadrants:\n\nTop-left: rows0-4, cols0-4.\n\nTop-right: rows0-4, cols5-9.\n\nBottom-left: rows5-9, cols0-4.\n\nBottom-right: rows5-9, cols5-9.\n\nBut the input is 10x10, so each quadrant is5x5.\n\nCounting 8s in each quadrant:\n\nTop-left quadrant (rows0-4, cols0-4):\n\nRow2:0,1,0,8,8 \u2192 two 8s.\n\nRow3:0,1,8,8,8 \u2192 three 8s.\n\nRow4:0,1,0,0,8 \u2192 one 8.\n\nTotal:2+3+1=6 \u21926*2=12.\n\nTop-right quadrant (rows0-4, cols5-9):\n\nRow2:0,0,0,0,1,0 \u2192 cols5-9:0,0,0,0,0? Wait, row2 is [0,1,0,8,8,0,0,0,1,0]. So cols5-9 are 8,0,0,0,1 \u2192 but the input is 10 columns. So cols5-9: indexes5 to9.\n\nRow2:0,1,0,8,8,0,0,0,1,0 \u2192 cols5-9:0,0,0,1,0 \u2192 no 8s.\n\nRow3:0,1,8,8,8,0,8,0,1,0 \u2192 cols5-9:0,8,0,1,0 \u2192 one 8.\n\nRow4:0,1,0,0,8,0,8,0,1,0 \u2192 cols5-9:0,8,0,1,0 \u2192 one 8.\n\nTotal 8s in top-right quadrant:0 +1 +1 =2 \u21922*2=4.\n\nBottom-left quadrant (rows5-9, cols0-4):\n\nRow5:0,1,0,8,0,0,8,0,1,0 \u2192 cols0-4:0,1,0,8,0 \u2192 one 8.\n\nRow6:0,1,8,8,0,8,0,8,1,0 \u2192 cols0-4:0,1,8,8,0 \u2192 two 8s.\n\nRow7:0,1,0,8,0,0,8,0,1,0 \u2192 cols0-4:0,1,0,8,0 \u2192 one 8.\n\nRows8-9: row8 is [1,1,...], no 8s.\n\nTotal:1+2+1=4 \u21924*2=8.\n\nBottom-right quadrant (rows5-9, cols5-9):\n\nRow5: cols5-9:0,8,0,1,0 \u2192 one 8.\n\nRow6: cols5-9:8,0,8,1,0 \u2192 two 8s.\n\nRow7: cols5-9:0,8,0,1,0 \u2192 one 8.\n\nRows8-9: no 8s.\n\nTotal:1+2+1=4 \u21924*2=8.\n\nSo the quadrant sums are:\n\nTop-left:12\n\nTop-right:4\n\nBottom-left:8\n\nBottom-right:8\n\nBut how to arrange these in the output.\n\nThe output for the Test Input would then have these values arranged in a 5x5 grid, but I'm not sure how. However, the examples have the quadrant sums in certain positions. For Example0, the quadrant sums were6 (top-left),2 (top-right),2 (bottom-left),4 (bottom-right), but the output was 4x4.\n\nBut perhaps the output for the Test Input is structured as follows:\n\nThe first row of the output contains the first and last elements of the first input row (3 and4), and the counts of 8s in the top quadrants. The middle rows contain the quadrant sums, and the last row contains the first and last elements of the last input row (7 and5) and the counts of 8s in the bottom quadrants.\n\nBut this is speculation. Alternatively, the output is a 5x5 matrix where:\n\n- The corners are the input's corners:3,4,7,5.\n\n- The middle elements are the quadrant sums.\n\nBut given the time, I'll proceed to write the answer based on the examples and the quadrant sums. However, since this is a hypothetical scenario, I'll have to make an educated guess.\n\nThe Test Input's quadrant sums are12 (top-left),4 (top-right),8 (bottom-left),8 (bottom-right). But how to arrange them. Looking at Example0's output, the quadrant sums were6,2,2,4 arranged in certain positions. The output included these sums in the middle rows. For the Test Input, perhaps the output is structured similarly, with the sums placed in the middle and the input's corners in the first and last rows.\n\nBut without a clear pattern, I'll have to proceed with the information I have. The likely output for the Test Input is:\n\n[3,4]\n\n[12,4]\n\n[8,8]\n\n[7,5]\n\nBut this doesn't match the example formats. Alternatively, considering that the output in Example0 and Example2 have the input's corners and quadrant sums arranged in a larger matrix, the Test Input's output might be:\n\n[3, 4]\n\n[12,4]\n\n[8,8]\n\n[7,5]\n\nBut this is a 4x2 matrix, which doesn't fit the examples' structure.\n\nAlternatively, the output is structured with the input's corners and the quadrant sums in a specific way. For example:\n\nRow0: [3,4]\n\nRow1: [12,4]\n\nRow2: [8,8]\n\nRow3: [7,5]\n\nBut the examples' outputs have more elements per row. Given the time constraints, I'll proceed to format the answer based on the examples and my best guess."
