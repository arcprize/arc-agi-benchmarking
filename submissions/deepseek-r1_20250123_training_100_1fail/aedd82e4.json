        "cot_1": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. So, looking at the training examples, each input is a grid of numbers, and the output seems to modify some of those numbers. Let me go through each example step by step.\n\nStarting with Example 0. The input is three rows:\n\n[0, 2, 2]\n[0, 2, 2]\n[2, 0, 0]\n\nAnd the output changes the last row from [2,0,0] to [1,0,0]. So the 2 became a 1. Hmm. Wait, why that one? Let me check the other examples.\n\nExample 1's input is a 4x4 grid. The output changes two elements: in the third row, the last 2 becomes a 1, and in the fourth row, the second 2 becomes a 1. So again, some 2s are turning into 1s. But how do we know which ones?\n\nLooking at Example 2. The input has a row [2, 2, 0, 2] which in the output becomes [2, 2, 0, 1]. The last 2 in that row becomes a 1. Then in the third row, there's a 2 at the end that's changed to 1. Wait, the other rows don't change. So maybe the 2s that are in certain positions get converted to 1s.\n\nIn Example 3, the input has:\n\n[2, 2, 0]\n[2, 0, 2]\n[0, 2, 0]\n\nThe output changes the third element in the second row to 1 and the middle element in the third row to 1. So the 2s in positions (1,2) and (2,1) (if we index from 0) become 1s.\n\nWait, maybe there's a rule here. Let's look for a commonality. All the 2s that are changed to 1s are in positions where they are adjacent to a 0. Or maybe they are the last 2 in their row or column? Or maybe it's about being adjacent to the edge?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 2s that are \"exposed\" in some way get turned into 1s. Let's think of the grid as layers. Like, if a 2 is on the outermost layer (the perimeter of the grid), maybe it's changed to a 1. Let's check.\n\nIn Example 0, the input's third row is [2,0,0]. The 2 is in the first position of the row, which is on the left edge of the grid. So maybe perimeter 2s become 1s. Let's see:\n\nIn Example 0's output, the 2 in position (2,0) (third row, first element) becomes a 1. That's on the edge. But in Example 1's input, the third row is [0,0,0,2], and the output changes the last element to 1. The last element is on the right edge of the grid, so that's perimeter. Similarly, the fourth row's second element (from example 1) is 2, which is in the middle of the row, but wait, maybe it's on the perimeter. Let's check the position: row 3 (since rows are 0-based?), column 1. If the grid is 4x4, then the perimeter includes all elements in the first or last row, or first or last column. So row 3 is the last row (since rows are 0-based?), no, wait the input in example 1 is a 4x4 grid. So rows 0 to 3. The third row (index 3) is the last row. The fourth row's second element (in example 1) is in row 3, column 1. So it's in the last row but not the first or last column. But the output changes that 2 to 1. Hmm, that contradicts the perimeter idea. Because that element is in the last row (perimeter row) but in column 1, which is not a perimeter column. Wait, maybe perimeter includes all elements in the first or last row OR first or last column. So if a cell is in the first row, last row, first column, or last column, it's part of the perimeter. Then, any 2 in the perimeter becomes 1. Let's test this.\n\nExample 0's third row [2,0,0]. The first element (row 2, column 0) is on the left edge (column 0) so perimeter. Changed to 1. Correct.\n\nExample 1's third row [0,0,0,2], last element is column 3 (last column) which is perimeter. Changed to 1. The fourth row [0,2,0,0], the 2 is in column 1, which is not a perimeter column. But in the output, that becomes 1. Wait, but row 3 is the last row (if rows are 0-based), so the fourth row would be index 3. So in row 3, column 1, that's part of the perimeter (last row) even though column is not first or last. So in that case, the 2 is in the perimeter (last row), so it's changed to 1. So the perimeter 2s become 1s.\n\nSo the rule would be: For each 2 in the perimeter (any cell in the first or last row, or first or last column), replace it with 1. Let's check other examples.\n\nExample 2's input has a row [2,2,0,2]. The last element is 2, which is in the last column (perimeter) so changed to 1. The other 2s in that row are in columns 0 and 1. Column 0 is perimeter, so those 2s would be changed? Wait, but in the output, they remain 2. Wait, the output for example 2's first row is [2,2,0,0]. Wait, the input's first row is [2,2,0,0], output same. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the example. Let me recheck.\n\nExample 2's input:\n\n[2,2,0,0]\n[0,2,0,0]\n[2,2,0,2]\n[0,0,0,0]\n[0,2,2,2]\n\nThe output for the third row (third row is [2,2,0,2]) becomes [2,2,0,1]. So only the last element (column 3) is changed. The first element of that row is 2 in column 0 (perimeter column). Why wasn't that changed? Hmm. Wait, maybe the perimeter is only the outermost layer. Let's think of it as layers. For example, in a grid, the first layer is the perimeter. If the grid is a rectangle, then the first and last rows, and the first and last columns. So any cell in those positions is perimeter. So in example 2, the third row is row 2 (since rows are 0-based) in a 5-row grid. The first row is row 0, last row is row 4. So the third row (row 2) is in the middle, not part of the perimeter. Wait, but the third row of the input is [2,2,0,2], which is row 2. So that row is not part of the perimeter. Wait, but in example 2's output, the last element of that row is changed to 1. But according to the perimeter idea, that cell is in column 3 (last column), which is perimeter. So even if the row is not first or last, if the column is first or last, then it's part of the perimeter. So in that case, the last element (column 3) is perimeter, hence 2 becomes 1. So in that row, the first element (column 0) is in the first column (perimeter), so it should also be changed. But in the input row [2,2,0,2], the first two elements are 2s. The output for that row is [2,2,0,1]. Wait, so the first 2 (column 0, perimeter) remains 2. That contradicts the rule. Hmm. So maybe my initial assumption is wrong.\n\nLet me re-examine example 2. The input's third row is [2,2,0,2]. The output changes only the last element to 1. The first element is 2, column 0 (perimeter), but it's not changed. So the perimeter idea might not hold. What's different here?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule is that the 2s that are adjacent (horizontally or vertically) to a 0 in the same row or column get converted to 1. Let me check example 0. The third row [2,0,0]. The 2 is next to a 0, so it becomes 1. In example 1's third row [0,0,0,2], the 2 is at the end, adjacent to 0 (the previous element is 0). So it's converted. In the fourth row [0,2,0,0], the 2 is between 0s (left and right), so it's converted. Example 2's third row [2,2,0,2]: the first 2 is next to another 2 (not 0), the second 2 is next to 2 and 0. The last 2 is next to 0 (third element) and perhaps another 0 in the next row? Wait, the row is [2,2,0,2], and the next row is [0,0,0,0]. So the last 2 is in column 3, which in the row below is 0. So maybe vertical adjacency. So that 2 is adjacent to 0 below, hence becomes 1. The first 2 in that row is adjacent to another 2 and the row above's elements. Let's see: the row above (row 1) is [0,2,0,0]. So the element above the first 2 in row 2 is 0. So maybe vertical adjacency. So the first 2 in row 2, column 0 (value 2) is adjacent to row 1's column 0, which is 0. So that 2 is adjacent to 0 (vertically) and thus should be converted. But in the output, it's still 2. So that contradicts.\n\nHmm, this approach might not be right. Let me think again.\n\nLooking at example 3. Input:\n\n[2,2,0]\n[2,0,2]\n[0,2,0]\n\nOutput:\n\n[2,2,0]\n[2,0,1]\n[0,1,0]\n\nThe 2s that were converted are the last element of the second row (from 2 to 1) and the middle element of the third row (from 2 to 1). Let's see their positions. The last element in the second row is column 2. The row is [2,0,2]. The elements adjacent to that 2 are 0 (left) and nothing (since it's the end). So maybe the 2 is adjacent to 0. The middle element in the third row is 2. Its adjacent elements are 0 (above and below, maybe). Wait, the third row is [0,2,0]. So the middle 2 is between 0s. So that's adjacent to 0s. So perhaps the rule is: any 2 that is adjacent (horizontally or vertically) to a 0 is converted to 1.\n\nBut let's check example 0. The third row [2,0,0]. The first 2 is adjacent to 0 (to the right), so becomes 1. Yes. The second and third elements are 0s. So that fits.\n\nExample 1's third row [0,0,0,2]. The last 2 is adjacent to 0 (left) and possibly the row below. The row below is [0,2,0,0], so above the 2 in row 3, column 3 (last element) is 0 in row 2. Wait, the third row in the input is [0,0,0,2], and the fourth row is [0,2,0,0]. So the 2 in row 2, column 3 (third row if rows are 0-based?) is adjacent to 0 in row 3, column 3 (which is 0). So vertical adjacency. So that 2 is adjacent to 0 below. So converted to 1. The fourth row's 2 is in column 1. It's adjacent to 0 on the left and right (same row) and perhaps the row above (which is row 3: [0,0,0,2], column 1 is 0). So vertical adjacency. So converted to 1. So that fits the rule.\n\nIn example 2's third row [2,2,0,2]. The first 2 is at column 0. Its adjacent cells: left (none), right is 2 (same row), above is row 1's column 0 (which is 0 from input row 1: [0,2,0,0]). So vertical adjacency to 0. So according to the rule, this 2 should become 1. But in the output, it remains 2. Hmm. That contradicts. So what's different here?\n\nWait, maybe the adjacency is only considering immediate neighbors in the same row or column. Let me recheck. Example 2's third row (row 2) is [2,2,0,2]. The first element (row 2, column 0) is adjacent to row 1, column 0, which is 0. So vertical adjacency. So according to the rule, it should be converted. But in the output, it's still 2. So that's a problem.\n\nWait, maybe the rule is different. Maybe only the 2s that are adjacent to 0 in the same row. Let's check. For example 0's third row: [2,0,0] \u2192 2 is adjacent to 0 in the same row (right), so converted. Example 1's third row's 2 is at the end, adjacent to 0 in the same row (left). Fourth row's 2 is between two 0s. Example 3's converted 2s are adjacent to 0s in same row. But in example 2's third row, the first 2 (row 2, column 0) is adjacent to 2 in the same row (right), and in the column above (row 1, column 0 is 0). If the rule is that the 2 must have at least one adjacent 0 in any direction (up, down, left, right), then it would be converted. But in example 2's third row, that 2 is adjacent to 0 above, so it should become 1. But in the output, it's not. So why is that?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the adjacency is only considered in the same row and column, not diagonal. So maybe the rule is: a 2 is converted to 1 if it is directly adjacent (horizontally or vertically) to a 0. Let's check all examples again.\n\nExample 0: Third row [2,0,0]. The first 2 is adjacent to 0 to the right. So converted. Correct.\n\nExample 1: Third row [0,0,0,2]. The 2 is adjacent to 0 to the left. Converted. Fourth row's 2 is between 0s (left and right). Converted.\n\nExample 2: Third row [2,2,0,2]. The first 2 (row 2, column 0) is adjacent to 2 (right) and 0 (above, row 1 column 0 is 0). So vertically adjacent to 0. Should convert, but it's not. So this breaks the rule. So why isn't it converted?\n\nHmm. What's different about example 2? Let's look at the output. Only the last element of the third row is changed to 1. The first 2 (column 0) in that row remains 2, even though it's adjacent to 0 above. So maybe the adjacency is only considered in the same row, not column.\n\nIf the rule is that 2s are converted to 1 if they have a 0 to their left or right in the same row. Let's check.\n\nExample 0 third row: 2 is next to 0 on the right \u2192 converted. Correct.\n\nExample 1 third row's 2 is at the end, next to 0 on the left \u2192 converted. Fourth row's 2 is between two 0s \u2192 converted. Correct.\n\nExample 2's third row: last 2 is next to 0 (third element) \u2192 converted. First 2 is next to 2 \u2192 not converted. So that fits. But what about the 2 in row 4 (if rows are zero-based?), the last row's first element in example 2's output is 0. Wait, example 2's input last row is [0,2,2,2]. The output remains the same. So in that row, the 2s are next to other 2s (same row) and perhaps no 0s adjacent. So they stay. But in that case, why in example 3's second row [2,0,2], the last 2 is adjacent to 0 (same row, middle element is 0). So in example 3's second row, the last 2 is adjacent to 0 on the left. So converted to 1. Which matches the output.\n\nBut example 2's third row first 2 is in column 0. The row is [2,2,0,2]. The 2s in columns 0 and 1 are adjacent to each other and to 0 (for column 2). Wait, column 0's 2 is adjacent to column 1's 2 (same row) and the row above's column 0's 0. If the rule is same-row adjacency, then the first 2 (column 0) is not adjacent to 0 in the same row. So it's not converted. But vertically adjacent 0 would count if the rule includes vertical adjacency. But since in example 2's case, the first 2 in row 2, column 0 is adjacent to a 0 above (row 1, column 0). But in the output, it's not converted. So the rule must not consider vertical adjacency.\n\nSo the rule might be: replace 2 with 1 if the 2 has a 0 immediately to its left or right in the same row.\n\nLet me test this.\n\nExample 0 third row [2,0,0]. The first 2 has 0 to the right \u2192 converted. Correct.\n\nExample 1's third row last element 2: has 0 to the left \u2192 converted. Fourth row's 2 has 0s left and right \u2192 converted.\n\nExample 2's third row [2,2,0,2]. The last 2 (column 3) has 0 to the left (column 2) \u2192 converted. The first two 2s (columns 0 and 1) are adjacent to 2s, so not converted. Correct. So the output for example 2 is correct with this rule.\n\nExample 3's second row [2,0,2]. The first 2 (column 0) has 2 to the right (no 0), the middle is 0, the last 2 (column 2) has 0 to the left. So only the last 2 is converted. Wait, but in the output, the second row becomes [2,0,1]. Yes. The third row is [0,2,0]. The middle 2 is adjacent to 0s left and right \u2192 converted to 1. So that fits.\n\nSo the pattern seems to be: for each 2 in the grid, if it has a 0 in the same row either to the left or right, then replace it with 1. Otherwise, leave it as 2.\n\nTesting this with all examples:\n\nExample 0: Third row's first 2 has a 0 to the right \u2192 becomes 1. The other rows don't have 2s with 0s adjacent in same row. Correct.\n\nExample 1: third row's last 2 (0 to left), fourth row's middle 2 (0s left and right) \u2192 converted. Correct.\n\nExample 2: third row's last 2 (0 to left) \u2192 converted. Others in same row don't have 0 adjacent. Correct.\n\nExample 3: second row's last 2 (0 to left) and third row's middle 2 (0s left and right) \u2192 converted. Correct.\n\nNow, applying this rule to the test input:\n\nTest Input:\n\n[2, 2, 0, 2]\n[0, 2, 0, 0]\n[0, 0, 2, 0]\n[2, 0, 0, 0]\n[0, 0, 2, 2]\n\nLet's go row by row.\n\nFirst row: [2, 2, 0, 2]. Check each 2.\n\nFirst 2 (index 0): to the right is 2. No 0 adjacent. So remains 2.\n\nSecond 2 (index 1): right is 0. So this 2 is adjacent to 0 (right) \u2192 becomes 1.\n\nThird element is 0, no change.\n\nFourth element is 2: left is 0. So adjacent to 0 \u2192 becomes 1.\n\nSo the first row becomes [2,1,0,1].\n\nWait, but let's check each 2 in the row:\n\nFor index 0: 2. Next element is 2 (right), previous is none. So no 0 adjacent. Stays 2.\n\nIndex 1: 2. Next element is 0 (right) \u2192 yes. So becomes 1.\n\nIndex 3: 2. Previous element is 0 (left) \u2192 yes. So becomes 1.\n\nSo first row output: [2,1,0,1].\n\nSecond row: [0,2,0,0].\n\nCheck each 2. Only index 1 is 2. Left is 0 (index 0), right is 0 (index 2). So this 2 has 0s on both sides \u2192 converted to 1. So row becomes [0,1,0,0].\n\nThird row: [0,0,2,0]. The 2 is at index 2. Left is 0 (index 1), right is 0 (index 3). So converted to 1. Row becomes [0,0,1,0].\n\nFourth row: [2,0,0,0]. The 2 is at index 0. Right is 0 \u2192 converted to 1. So row becomes [1,0,0,0].\n\nFifth row: [0,0,2,2]. Check each 2. First 2 at index 2: left is 0 (index 1), right is 2 (index 3). So adjacent to 0 left \u2192 converted to 1. The next 2 at index 3: left is 2, right none. So no 0 adjacent. Stays 2. So fifth row becomes [0,0,1,2].\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nOutput rows:\n\n[2, 1, 0, 1]\n[0, 1, 0, 0]\n[0, 0, 1, 0]\n[1, 0, 0, 0]\n[0, 0, 1, 2]\n\nBut let's check the training examples again to make sure about the pattern. For example, in example 1, the third row's last 2 becomes 1 because it's adjacent to 0 on the left (same row). So according to this, the test input's first row's second and fourth elements are converted. The fourth row's first element (2) becomes 1. The fifth row's third element (2) becomes 1. So the output should be as above.\n\nBut let's check if there's any other possible rules. For instance, what if vertical adjacency is also considered? For example, in example 3's third row, the 2 is in the middle and has 0s above and below (row 2: [0,2,0], so row 1 is [2,0,2] and row 3 (assuming zero-based) may not exist. Wait, example 3 is a 3x3 grid. So the third row is the last row. The middle element is 2, which is in row 2. The elements above are row 1's middle (0), and below there is no row. So the vertical adjacency would be to 0 above and 0 below (but no row below). So vertical adjacency might not be part of the rule, given that the previous examples don't show that.\n\nBut according to the test input's fourth row [2,0,0,0], the 2 is at index 0. It's adjacent to 0 on the right, so converted. So row becomes [1,0,0,0].\n\nThus, the final output for the test input should be:\n\n[2, 1, 0, 1]\n[0, 1, 0, 0]\n[0, 0, 1, 0]\n[1, 0, 0, 0]\n[0, 0, 1, 2]\n\nBut wait, let's check example 2's fifth row, which in the input is [0,2,2,2] and output remains the same. Because in that row, the 2s are adjacent to other 2s and no 0s in the same row. So the rule holds.\n\nSo applying this to the test input, that's the correct transformation.",

        "cot_2": "Okay, let's see. I need to figure out the pattern here. Let's look at the training examples one by one.\n\nStarting with Example 0. The input is three rows:\n\n[0, 2, 2]\n[0, 2, 2]\n[2, 0, 0]\n\nOutput is:\n\n[0, 2, 2]\n[0, 2, 2]\n[1, 0, 0]\n\nHmm. So the third row changed from [2,0,0] to [1,0,0]. The only change is the first element from 2 to 1. What's special about that position? Let's check other examples.\n\nExample 1's input is a 4x4 grid. The output changes some elements to 1. For instance, the third row's last element goes from 2 to 1. The fourth row's second element from 2 to 1. Maybe those 2s are being turned into 1s under certain conditions.\n\nLooking at Example 3's input:\n\n[2, 2, 0]\n[2, 0, 2]\n[0, 2, 0]\n\nOutput:\n\n[2, 2, 0]\n[2, 0, 1]\n[0, 1, 0]\n\nHere, the second row's third element (2 \u2192 1) and third row's second element (2 \u21921). So again, certain 2s become 1s.\n\nWhat's common about those positions where 2s are changed to 1s? Maybe they are adjacent to a 0 or something else. Let's check the surrounding cells.\n\nIn Example 0, the third row's first element was 2. Let's look at its neighbors. The cell above it is [0,2,2] in the second row's first element (0). Maybe if a 2 is adjacent (below or above) to a 0, it becomes 1. Wait, but in Example 0, the 2 in third row first position is below a 0 (second row first element). So maybe that's the trigger.\n\nBut let's check other examples. In Example 1, the third row's last element was 2 in input, which becomes 1 in output. The cells adjacent to it: above is 0 (row 2's last element?), to the left in the same row is 0, and below is 0 (from row 4's last element? Wait, let's check Example1's input:\n\nInput rows:\n\n[2,2,2,0]\n[0,2,0,0]\n[0,0,0,2]\n[0,2,0,0]\n\nSo third row is [0,0,0,2], fourth row [0,2,0,0]. The third row's last element is 2. Below it is the fourth row's last element which is 0. So that 2 is adjacent (below) to 0. So maybe when a 2 is vertically adjacent to a 0, it turns into 1.\n\nBut in Example 0, the third row's first element (2) is above a 0? Wait, no. Wait, in Example0, the third row is [2,0,0]. The row above it is the second row [0,2,2]. So the cell above is 0. So that 2 is adjacent (above) to 0. So maybe vertical adjacency (either above or below) to 0 causes 2 to become 1.\n\nBut let's check Example3's input:\n\nInput:\n\n[2,2,0]\n[2,0,2]\n[0,2,0]\n\nOutput changes the second row's third element (2) to 1. Let's check neighbors. The cell below it is row3's third element (0). So that 2 is adjacent below to 0. So it becomes 1. The third row's second element was 2, adjacent above to 0 (row2's second element is 0), so it becomes 1.\n\nSo the pattern might be: any 2 in a cell that is vertically adjacent (either directly above or below) to a 0 gets converted to 1. But horizontal adjacency doesn't count? Let's verify.\n\nLooking at Example2's input:\n\nInput:\n\n[2,2,0,0]\n[0,2,0,0]\n[2,2,0,2]\n[0,0,0,0]\n[0,2,2,2]\n\nOutput:\n\n[2,2,0,0]\n[0,2,0,0]\n[2,2,0,1]\n[0,0,0,0]\n[0,2,2,2]\n\nIn the third row (originally [2,2,0,2]), the last element was 2. Let's check neighbors. The cell below is row4's last element (0 in input? No, row4 is [0,0,0,0], so last element is 0. So this 2 is above a 0, so it becomes 1. That fits. Are there other 2s that should be converted? Let's see. In row5 (output's last row is [0,2,2,2]. The input's last row is same as output. The 2s here: are any of them vertically adjacent to 0s? Let's see the row above (row4) is all 0s. So each 2 in row5 is directly below a 0. So why aren't those 2s turned into 1s? Wait, in the output, row5 remains [0,2,2,2]. That's conflicting with the pattern. So maybe my initial hypothesis is wrong.\n\nWait, in Example2's input, the last row is [0,2,2,2]. The row above is [0,0,0,0]. So each of the 2s in the last row is directly below a 0. But in the output, they are still 2s. So this contradicts the previous pattern.\n\nHmm. So maybe vertical adjacency isn't the only condition. Or perhaps there's another condition. Let's look again.\n\nIn Example2's output, only the third row's last element (2\u21921). The others in the last row are 2s. So why aren't they changed? Let's check their positions. The last row's elements: [0,2,2,2]. The row above is [0,0,0,0]. So each 2 in the last row is below a 0. But they remain 2s. So why is only the third row's last element changed?\n\nWait, maybe it's not just vertical adjacency. Maybe the direction matters. Like, a 2 is below a 0 (so the 0 is above) but maybe only if the 2 is above a 0, then it gets converted. Wait no, in Example0, the 2 was in the third row (row3) and the 0 was in row2. So the 2 was below the 0, but it got converted. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternative approach: maybe it's the number of adjacent 0s. Let's see. In Example0, the 2 in row3, col1 has one 0 above it. In Example1, the 2 that became 1 in row3, col4: has a 0 below (row4, col4 is 0). Also, in row4, col2: 2 becomes 1. The cell above is row3, col2 which is 0. So perhaps any 2 that has a 0 directly above or below becomes 1.\n\nBut in Example2, the last row's 2s are all below 0s (row4), so they should be converted. But they are not. So that's a problem.\n\nWait, maybe the rule is that 2s that are adjacent (vertically or horizontally) to a 0 are converted to 1. Let's check Example0 again. The 2 in row3, col0: adjacent (up) to 0. So converted. In Example1, the row3, col3 (2) is adjacent below to 0 (row4, col3). So converted. The row4, col1 (2) is adjacent above to row3, col1 (0). So converted. So that fits. Now check Example2's input. The third row, col3 (2) is adjacent below to row4, col3 (0). So converted to 1. The last row's 2s: each is adjacent above to 0 (from row4). So why aren't they converted? Because maybe horizontal adjacency is considered. Let's see. If a 2 is adjacent (vertically or horizontally) to a 0, then it's converted. So in the last row of Example2's input: row5, col1 is 2. It's adjacent above (0) and left (0) (from row5, col0). So adjacent in two directions. So why isn't it converted to 1? That's a contradiction.\n\nWait the output of Example2's last row is [0,2,2,2]. So the 2s are not converted. But according to the adjacent rule, they should be. So maybe there's another condition. Maybe only 2s that are adjacent vertically (not horizontally) to 0s are converted. Because in the last row's 2s, they have 0s above them (vertical adjacency). So according to that, they should be converted. But they are not. Hmm. So perhaps the rule is that a 2 is converted to 1 if it is directly above a 0. Because in Example0, the 2 is in row3, which is the bottom row. Wait, no. Wait, in Example0's input, the third row is [2,0,0]. The row above is [0,2,2]. So the 2 is below a 0. But in the output, it's converted to 1. So that contradicts the \"directly above\" idea.\n\nAlternative approach: Maybe the rule is that a 2 is converted to 1 if it is adjacent (vertically) to a 0 and it's the first occurrence in its column. Wait, looking at columns. Let's take Example0. Column 0:\n\nInput:\nRow0:0\nRow1:0\nRow2:2\n\nOutput column0:\n0,0,1\n\nSo the 2 is in row2, converted to 1. But how is that the first occurrence? Maybe the first 2 in a column when looking from the bottom up. So, for column0 in Example0, the bottom row (row2) is 2, converted to 1. So perhaps for each column, starting from the bottom, the first 2 encountered that is adjacent (above or below) to a 0 is converted to 1. Let's test this.\n\nExample1's column3:\n\nInput:\nRow0:0\nRow1:0\nRow2:2\nRow3:0\n\nFrom the bottom (row3 is 0, row2 is 2, row1 is 0, row0 is 0). The first 2 in column3 when looking from the bottom is row2. It is above a 0 (row3's column3 is 0). So converted to 1. Which matches the output.\n\nExample2's column3:\n\nInput rows (0 to4):\n\nRow0:0,2,0,0\nRow1:0,2,0,0\nRow2:2,2,0,2\nRow3:0,0,0,0\nRow4:0,2,2,2\n\nWait, the test input for Example2 is:\n\n[2,2,0,0]\n[0,2,0,0]\n[2,2,0,2]\n[0,0,0,0]\n[0,2,2,2]\n\nSo columns:\n\nColumn0: 2,0,2,0,0\n\nColumn1:2,2,2,0,2\n\nColumn2:0,0,0,0,2\n\nColumn3:0,0,2,0,2\n\nLooking at column3. From the bottom (row4, column3 is 2). Then row3:0, row2:2, etc. The first 2 when looking from the bottom is row4, column3 (2 in input). But in output, row2, column3 is changed to 1. Hmm. Wait no. The output for Example2 has row2's column3 as 1, which in input was 2. So according to this idea, in column3, looking from the bottom up, the first 2 encountered (row4) would be converted. But in output, row4's column3 is still 2. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternative idea: Maybe only the 2s that have a 0 directly below them. Let's check Example0. The 2 in row2, column0 (third row) has a 0 in row1, column0 (second row). Wait, no. The row above it is row1 (second row) which is [0,2,2], so row1, column0 is 0. So the 2 is below the 0. So if the 2 is below a 0, then it's converted. So maybe the rule is: any 2 that is immediately below a 0 is converted to 1.\n\nTesting this:\n\nExample0: third row, column0 is 2, which is below a 0 (row1, column0). Converted to 1. Correct.\n\nExample1: third row, column3 (2) is in row2. The row below it is row3, column3 is 0. So the 2 is above a 0. Wait, but the rule is if the 2 is below a 0. In this case, the 0 is below the 2. So according to this rule, the 2 wouldn't be converted. But in the output, it is converted. So this contradicts.\n\nHmm, this is getting confusing. Let me look at another example.\n\nExample3's input:\n\nRow0: [2,2,0]\nRow1: [2,0,2]\nRow2: [0,2,0]\n\nOutput:\n\nRow0 remains same.\nRow1: third element (2) becomes 1.\nRow2: second element (2) becomes 1.\n\nLooking at the row1's third element (2). The cell below is row2's third element (0). So the 2 is above a 0. So according to the previous idea (if a 2 is above a 0), would that trigger conversion? But according to the example, it is converted. So perhaps the rule is that a 2 is converted to 1 if there is a 0 directly above or below.\n\nBut in that case, why in Example2's last row, the 2s are below 0s (row4, all 0s). So each 2 in row5's columns 1,2,3 (since row5 is [0,2,2,2]) would be directly below a 0 (row4's columns 1,2,3 are 0). So according to the rule, they should be converted to 1. But in the output, they remain 2s. So this is conflicting.\n\nSo there must be another condition.\n\nAlternative approach: Maybe the 2 is converted to 1 only if it's adjacent to a 0 and is in the same position as the bottommost 2 in a column. Let's check.\n\nIn Example0, column0 has 0,0,2. The bottommost 2 is row2. It's adjacent (above) to 0, so converted.\n\nIn Example1's column3: 0,0,2,0. The bottommost 2 is in row2 (third row). Below it is row3's 0. So converted.\n\nIn Example2's column3: the input's column3 is 0,0,2,0,2. The bottommost 2 is in row4. Below that is nothing. So if adjacent to 0, but row4's column3 is 2, and row3's column3 is 0. So the 2 is above a 0. So according to that, the bottommost 2 in column3 is row4, which is above a 0. So it should be converted. But in the output, row4's column3 is still 2. Instead, row2's column3 (which is also a 2) is converted to 1. So that doesn't fit.\n\nWait, maybe it's the topmost 2 in a column that's adjacent to a 0. Let's see.\n\nIn Example2's column3: the 2 in row2 (third row) is the first 2 from the top. Above it is row1's column3 (0). So adjacent above to 0. So converted. The bottommost 2 in row4 is not adjacent above to 0 (row3's column3 is 0, so it is adjacent below to 0. Wait, row4's column3 is 2, and row3's column3 is 0. So the 2 is above a 0. So if the rule is that a 2 is converted if it's above a 0, then row4's column3 2 would be converted, but in output it's not. So this is confusing.\n\nLet's think differently. Maybe the transformation involves looking at each cell and if it's a 2 and has exactly one 0 adjacent (vertically or horizontally), then it becomes 1. But again, need to check.\n\nExample0's third row, first column: adjacent cells are above (0), left (none), right (0). So adjacent to one 0. Converted to 1. Fits.\n\nExample1's third row, fourth column: adjacent cells are below (0), left (0). So two 0s. But it's converted to 1. So this doesn't fit. So maybe not the number of zeros, but presence of at least one.\n\nBut that doesn't explain Example2's last row.\n\nAlternative idea: Maybe 2s are converted to 1 if they are directly above a 0. So the 0 is below the 2. Let's check.\n\nExample0's third row first column (2) is in row2. Below it is nothing (since it's the last row). So no. So that can't be.\n\nExample1's third row, fourth column (2) is in row2. The cell below is row3, fourth column (0). So the 2 is above a 0. Converted to 1. Fits.\n\nExample3's second row third column (2) is above row3's third column (0). Converted to 1. Also fits.\n\nExample3's third row second column (2) is in row2. Below it is row3's second column (0). So converted to 1. Fits.\n\nIn Example2's third row, fourth column (2) is above row4's fourth column (0). So converted to 1. Which matches the output. However, in Example2's last row, each 2 is in row4, and below them is row5 (assuming it's the last row). But row5 is part of the input. Wait, in Example2's input, there are 5 rows. The rows are 0 to4. So row4 is the last one. The input rows are:\n\n[2,2,0,0] (row0)\n[0,2,0,0] (row1)\n[2,2,0,2] (row2)\n[0,0,0,0] (row3)\n[0,2,2,2] (row4)\n\nSo row4's elements: [0,2,2,2]. Each of these 2s are in row4, column1,2,3. The row below would be non-existent. So they are not above any 0. But their row is row4, and the row above is row3, which is all 0s. So each 2 in row4 is above a 0 (since row3's corresponding columns are 0). Wait, no. The row above row4 is row3. So a 2 in row4's column1 is below row3's column1 (0). So the 2 is below a 0. So according to this hypothetical rule (2s above a 0), they would not be converted. But according to the previous example, if the 2 is below a 0, maybe it's not converted. \n\nBut in Example0's third row (row2), the 2 is below a 0 (row1, column0). But it's converted. So that contradicts this idea.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the direction doesn't matter. If a 2 is adjacent vertically (either above or below) to a 0, then it's converted to 1. But then in Example2's row4's 2s, each is adjacent above (row3) to 0. So they should be converted. But in the output, they are not. So why?\n\nLooking back at Example2's input and output:\n\nInput row4: [0,2,2,2]\nOutput row4: [0,2,2,2]\n\nSo no change. So the 2s in row4, columns1-3 are all vertically adjacent to 0s (since row3 is all 0s). According to the rule, they should be converted to 1. But they are not. So this rule can't be right.\n\nHmm. So perhaps there's a different condition. Maybe the 2s are converted to 1 if they are the last 2 in their column when viewed from the top. Let's see.\n\nIn Example0, column0 has 0,0,2. The last 2 is row2. It's adjacent to a 0 (above it), so converted.\n\nIn Example1, column3: 0,0,2,0. The last 2 is row2. Adjacent below to 0. Converted.\n\nIn Example3, column2 of row1 (2) is the last 2 in that column. It's adjacent below to 0 (row2's column2 is 0). So converted.\n\nIn Example2's column3: the input is 0,0,2,0,2. So the last 2 is row4's column3. Adjacent above to 0. But in output, row2's column3 (which is also a 2) is converted. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule is that for each row, from bottom to top, any 2 that is adjacent to a 0 in the row below is converted to 1. Let's test this.\n\nIn Example0, the bottom row is [2,0,0]. The row below it doesn't exist, so no change. Then looking up to row1: [0,2,2]. The row below (row2) is [2,0,0]. So in row1, the first element is 0, adjacent to row2's 2. So why isn't that 0 affecting anything? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, process each cell from top to bottom. For each cell, if it's a 2 and the cell directly below it is 0, then convert to 1.\n\nExample0's row2 (third row) is [2,0,0]. The cell below is non-existent. So no. But this cell was converted. So no.\n\nExample1's third row, column4 (assuming it's 0-based index). Wait, in Example1's input, row2 is [0,0,0,2]. The row below is row3 [0,2,0,0]. So the 2 in row2, column3 (assuming indexes start at 0) is adjacent to row3, column3 (0). So convert to 1. Which matches the output. The 2 in row3, column1 (0-based) is in row3's input [0,2,0,0]. The row below is row4 [0,2,0,0]. So the cell below is 2. So no conversion. But in the output, row3's column1 is converted to 1. So this doesn't fit.\n\nThis is getting really tricky. Let's think of another angle.\n\nLooking at the examples, the outputs have exactly one 1 introduced in each example. For example, Example0 has one 1. Example1 has two 1s. Example2 has one 1. Example3 has two 1s. So it's not a fixed number. \n\nAnother approach: perhaps 1s are placed in positions where a 2 is surrounded by 0s. But in Example0's converted cell, it's adjacent to 0 above and 0 to the right. But maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's a gravity-based puzzle. For example, 2s are \"falling\" down until they hit a 0, and when they stop, they turn into 1s. So perhaps each 2 moves down as far as possible, then becomes 1. Let's see.\n\nIn Example0's third row, first column is 2. If gravity pulls it down, but it's already at the bottom. So it turns into 1. But why? Because it can't move further. But that doesn't explain other examples.\n\nIn Example1's third row, last column's 2. If gravity is applied, it would fall down to row3's column3, which is 0. So the 2 moves down and becomes 1. But the input's row3 is [0,2,0,0], so row3's column3 is 0. So the 2 from row2's column3 moves down to row3, and becomes 1. So in the output, row3's column3 is 1. But in the input, row3's column3 was 0. So maybe the 2 moves down and replaces the 0, but becomes 1. But how does this fit with other examples?\n\nIn Example3's input row1's third column (2) is in row1. If it falls down, the cell below is row2's third column (0). So it moves to row2, column3, becomes 1. But in the output, row1's third column is converted to 1, and row2's second column is also converted. So this might not fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s that are at the bottom of their column and are adjacent to a 0 above them turn into 1. For example, in Example0, the bottom 2 in column0 is adjacent to a 0 above. So it becomes 1. In Example1's third row's column3: the 2 is not the bottom of the column, because row3's column3 is 0. So maybe the 2 falls down and becomes 1 there. But the output shows the 2 is converted to 1 in row2's column3. So this doesn't fit.\n\nThis is getting frustrating. Maybe I should look for another pattern. Let's count the number of 2s and 0s. But in Example0's input, there are 4 2s. Output has 3 2s and 1 1. Example1's input has 6 2s. Output has 4 2s and 2 1s. So the number of 1s corresponds to the number of 2s that are converted. So the rule is that some 2s are turned into 1s based on their position.\n\nWait, maybe the 1s are placed in cells where there's a 0 directly above and directly below. But that's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule is to replace any 2 that is between two 0s in the same column. But in Example0's column0, the 2 is at the bottom, with a 0 above. No 0 below. So not between two 0s.\n\nAnother idea: Maybe each 2 that is adjacent (vertically) to a 0 and is the first in its column (from the top) gets converted. Let's see.\n\nExample0's column0: 0,0,2. First 2 is row2. Adjacent to 0 (row1). Converted to 1. Fits.\n\nExample1's column3: 0,0,2,0. First 2 is row2. Adjacent to 0 (row3). Converted. Fits.\n\nExample3's column2: 0,2,0. First 2 is row1. Adjacent to 0 below (row2). Converted to 1. Fits.\n\nExample3's column1: 2,0,2. First 2 is row0. Adjacent to 0 in row1. So why isn't it converted? Because in the output, row0's column1 remains 2. So this doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. Maybe the rule is for each column, the first 2 (from the top) that is vertically adjacent to a 0 (either above or below) is converted to 1, and others are left as 2.\n\nWait in Example3's column1, the first 2 is row0. Adjacent below to row1's 0. So why isn't it converted? Because in the output, row0's column1 is still 2. But according to this rule, it should be converted. So this is not matching.\n\nAlternatively, the rule could be that in each column, the first 2 from the bottom that has a 0 immediately below it is converted to 1. Wait, in Example0's column0, the 2 is in row2. Below it is nothing. So no. So that's not it.\n\nWait, I'm stuck. Let me look at the Test Input and see if I can apply any possible pattern.\n\nTest Input:\n\n[2, 2, 0, 2]\n[0, 2, 0, 0]\n[0, 0, 2, 0]\n[2, 0, 0, 0]\n[0, 0, 2, 2]\n\nSo 5 rows, 4 columns.\n\nLooking at the examples, the output changes some 2s to 1s. Let's see where in the Test Input this might happen.\n\nFor example, in column0:\n\nRows 0:2, row1:0, row2:0, row3:2, row4:0.\n\nSo in column0, there are 2s in row0 and row3. Let's see if any of them are adjacent vertically to 0s.\n\nRow0's column0 (2) is followed by row1's 0. So if the rule is that a 2 is followed by a 0 below it, then this 2 would be converted to 1. But in some examples, like Example1's row0's 2s (in column0,1,2) remain 2s, even though they are above 0s. Wait, in Example1's row0 is [2,2,2,0]. The row below is [0,2,0,0]. So the first three 2s in row0 are above 0,2,0. So the first 2 (row0, column0) is above a 0 (row1, column0). So if the rule is that a 2 is converted if it's directly above a 0, then in Example1's row0, column0 would be converted. But in the output, it remains 2.\n\nSo that can't be the rule.\n\nAlternative idea: Maybe the 2s that are at the bottom of their column and are followed by a 0 above. For example, in the Test Input's column3:\n\nRows: 2,0,0,0,2. So the bottom 2 is in row4. Above it is row3's 0. So maybe that 2 would be converted to 1. But looking at the examples, sometimes bottom 2s are converted, sometimes not.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that any 2 which is directly above a 0 is converted to 1. So in Test Input:\n\nRow0's column0 (2) is above row1's 0 \u2192 convert to 1.\n\nRow3's column0 (2) is above row4's 0 \u2192 convert to 1.\n\nRow0's column3 (2) is above row1's 0 \u2192 convert to 1.\n\nRow2's column2 (2) is above row3's 0 \u2192 convert to 1.\n\nRow4's column2 and 3 (2s) are at the bottom, so no 0 below.\n\nSo according to this, the Test Input's output would have 1s in positions (0,0), (3,0), (0,3), (2,2). But looking at the training examples, like Example1, there are 2s that are above 0s and are converted. But in Example0, the 2 is below a 0 and converted. So this rule doesn't fit.\n\nAnother approach: Looking at the training examples, the 1s are always introduced in the same position where the 2 was. So perhaps the 1s are replacing certain 2s based on their neighboring 0s. But how?\n\nWait, in Example0, the 2 is replaced by 1 in row2, column0. Its neighboring cells are: above (0), below (none), left (none), right (0). So it has two 0s adjacent (above and right).\n\nIn Example1's row2, column3 (2\u21921): adjacent cells are left (0), below (0). So two 0s.\n\nIn Example1's row3, column1 (2\u21921): adjacent above (0), adjacent below (0). So two 0s.\n\nIn Example3's row1, column2 (2\u21921): adjacent below (0). So one 0.\n\nIn Example3's row2, column1 (2\u21921): adjacent above (0). So one 0.\n\nSo the number of adjacent 0s varies. So maybe any 2 that has at least one 0 adjacent (vertically or horizontally) becomes 1. But in Example2's last row, the 2s have 0s above them. So why aren't they converted? Because maybe there's a priority rule. Like, only the first occurrence in each column or row.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 1s are placed where a 2 is adjacent to a 0, and it's the first such 2 in each column when viewed from the top.\n\nFor Example0's column0: the first 2 is in row2. Adjacent to 0 above. So converted.\n\nExample1's column3: the first 2 is in row2. Adjacent to 0 below. Converted.\n\nExample1's column1: the first 2 is row0. Adjacent to 0 in row1. So why isn't it converted? Because in Example1's output, the 2 in row0's column1 remains 2. So this doesn't fit.\n\nThis is really tricky. Let's try to find another pattern.\n\nAnother observation: In all examples, the 1s are only replacing 2s that are in positions where they are vertically adjacent to a 0. So either above or below.\n\nBut as before, in Example2's last row, the 2s are below 0s (row3 is all 0s). So they should be converted. But they are not.\n\nWait, maybe the rule is that a 2 is converted to 1 if there is a 0 in the same column somewhere below it. Let's test this.\n\nExample0's column0: 2 is in row2. There are no rows below, so no 0 below. But it's converted. So no.\n\nExample1's column3: 2 is in row2. There's a 0 in row3. So converted. Fits.\n\nExample3's column2: 2 is in row1. There's a 0 in row2. So converted.\n\nExample3's column1: 2 is in row2. There's a 0 in row3? Wait, no. Row3's column1 is 2. Wait, the input for Example3 is:\n\n[2,2,0]\n[2,0,2]\n[0,2,0]\n\nSo column1 is row0:2, row1:0, row2:2. So the 2 in row2's column1 has a 0 in row1. So there is a 0 above, but not below. So according to the rule, if there's a 0 below, but here it's above. So this rule doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, if there's a 0 anywhere in the same column, then the first 2 from the top is converted. But in Example0's column0, the first 2 is in row2. There are 0s above, so converted. In Example1's column3, first 2 is in row2, 0 below. Converted. But in Example3's column1, first 2 is in row0. There's a 0 in row1. So according to this rule, it should be converted, but in the output, it's not. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAt this point, I'm stuck. Maybe I should try to find the pattern by looking for the position of the changed 2s in the examples.\n\nExample0:\n\nInput row2: [2,0,0] \u2192 Output [1,0,0]. Changed cell is (2,0).\n\nExample1:\n\nInput row2: [0,0,0,2] \u2192 Output [0,0,0,1]. Changed cell (2,3).\n\nInput row3: [0,2,0,0] \u2192 Output [0,1,0,0]. Changed cell (3,1).\n\nExample2:\n\nInput row2: [2,2,0,2] \u2192 Output [2,2,0,1]. Changed cell (2,3).\n\nExample3:\n\nInput row1: [2,0,2] \u2192 Output [2,0,1]. Changed cell (1,2).\n\nInput row2: [0,2,0] \u2192 Output [0,1,0]. Changed cell (2,1).\n\nLooking at these positions:\n\n- (2,0) in Example0: the cell is in the third row, first column.\n\nLooking at the surrounding cells:\n\n- Above: (1,0) is 0.\n\n- Below: none.\n\n- Left: none.\n\n- Right: (2,1) is 0.\n\nSo vertically adjacent to 0 above.\n\nExample1's (2,3) is in row2, column3. Below is row3, column3 which is 0. So vertically adjacent below.\n\nExample1's (3,1): row3, column1. Above is row2, column1 which is 0. So vertically adjacent above.\n\nExample2's (2,3): row2, column3. Below is row3, column3 (0). Vertically adjacent below.\n\nExample3's (1,2): row1, column2. Below is row2, column2 (0). Vertically adjacent below.\n\nExample3's (2,1): row2, column1. Above is row1, column1 (0). Vertically adjacent above.\n\nSo all the changed cells have a 0 either directly above or below.\n\nSo the pattern seems to be: a 2 is converted to 1 if there is a 0 immediately above or below it. But then why in Example2's last row, the 2s are in row4, columns1-3. Their above cells (row3) are all 0s. So they should be converted. But they are not.\n\nWait, in Example2's input, the last row is [0,2,2,2]. The row above is [0,0,0,0]. So each 2 in row4's columns1-3 has a 0 above. So according to the pattern, they should be converted. But in the output, they are not. So what's different about these 2s?\n\nMaybe the direction of the adjacency matters. For example, only if the 0 is below the 2, then convert. But in Example0's case, the 0 is above the 2 and it's converted. So that can't be.\n\nAlternatively, the rule is that if a 2 is vertically adjacent to a 0, and it's the only such occurrence in its column, then it's converted. But in Example2's column1, there are multiple 2s. Let's check.\n\nExample2's column1:\n\nRows0:2, row1:2, row2:2, row3:0, row4:2.\n\nThe 2s in row0,1,2,4. In the output, row2's column3 is converted. But why not row4's column1? Because row4's column1 has a 0 above (row3's column1 is 0). So why isn't that converted?\n\nThis suggests that there's another condition. Maybe the 2 must be adjacent to a 0 and be the first such 2 in the column when viewed from the bottom up.\n\nSo for each column, we look from the bottom up. The first 2 we encounter that is adjacent to a 0 (above or below) is converted to 1. The others are left as 2.\n\nTesting this:\n\nExample0's column0:\n\nRow2 (bottom) is 2. Adjacent above is row1's 0. So converted.\n\nExample1's column3:\n\nRow3 (bottom) is 0. Row2 is 2. Adjacent below is 0. So converted.\n\nExample1's column1:\n\nRow3 is 2. Adjacent below is row4's 0. So row3's 2 is converted. But in Example1's output, row3's column1 is 1. So that fits.\n\nExample2's column1:\n\nRow4 (bottom) is 2. Adjacent above is row3's 0. So converted. But in output, row4's column1 remains 2. So this doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. So this idea also doesn't work.\n\nAt this point, I think I need to make a guess based on the examples. The pattern seems to be that a 2 is converted to 1 if it has a 0 directly below it. So the 2 is above a 0. Let's check.\n\nExample0's converted cell (row2, column0): there is no cell below. So no. So this can't be.\n\nExample1's converted cells:\n\nRow2, column3: has a 0 below (row3). Converted.\n\nRow3, column1: has a 0 below (row4's column1 is 2. No. So this doesn't fit.\n\nExample3's converted cell row1, column2: has a 0 below (row2). Converted.\n\nExample3's row2, column1: has a 0 above (row1). So according to this rule, it wouldn't convert. But it does. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAnother possibility: the direction doesn't matter. Any vertical adjacency to 0 converts 2 to 1.\n\nBut why are the 2s in Example2's last row not converted? They are adjacent above to 0.\n\nWait, perhaps in Example2's last row, the 2s are in row4. The row above is row3, which is all 0s. So each 2 in row4's columns1-3 has a 0 above. According to the rule, they should be converted. But they are not. So why?\n\nLooking at the output for Example2's input, the only change is row2, column3 (2\u21921). The 2 in row2's column3 is above row3's column3 (0), so converted. The 2s in row4's columns1-3 are above row3's 0s. So why aren't they converted?\n\nIs there a priority based on the row order? Maybe only the highest possible 2 in each column is converted. For example, in each column, find the highest 2 that has a 0 below it and convert it.\n\nExample0's column0: highest 2 is row2. Below is nothing. So not converted. But in the output, it is converted. So no.\n\nAlternatively, the lowest 2 in each column that has a 0 below it.\n\nExample0's column0: lowest 2 is row2. No cell below. So not converted. But it is. So no.\n\nThis is really challenging. Perhaps the answer is to change all 2s that are vertically adjacent to a 0, but only once per column. For example, the first 2 in the column when viewed from the top that is vertically adjacent to a 0.\n\nIn Example0's column0: first 2 is row2. Adjacent to 0 above. So converted.\n\nExample1's column3: first 2 is row2. Adjacent to 0 below. So converted.\n\nExample1's column1: first 2 is row0. Adjacent to 0 in row1. So converted. But in the output, row0's column1 is still 2. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, the first 2 in each column (from the top) that is adjacent to a 0 below. So if a 2 is directly above a 0, then convert. Let's test.\n\nExample0's column0: 2 in row2 is the only 2. There's no cell below. So no conversion. But output shows it's converted. So no.\n\nExample1's column3: 2 in row2 is above a 0 in row3. So converted. Fits.\n\nExample1's column1: 2 in row0 is above a 2 in row1. So no conversion. But row3's column1 is converted. So this doesn't fit.\n\nExample3's column2: 2 in row1 is above a 0 in row2. Converted. Fits.\n\nExample3's column1: 2 in row2 is above nothing. No conversion. But row2's column1 is converted. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAt this point, I'm out of ideas. Given the time I've spent and the test input, perhaps the pattern is that for each cell, if it is a 2 and the cell directly below it is a 0, then convert to 1. Let's apply this to the test input.\n\nTest Input:\n\nRow0: [2, 2, 0, 2]\n\nRow1: [0, 2, 0, 0]\n\nRow2: [0, 0, 2, 0]\n\nRow3: [2, 0, 0, 0]\n\nRow4: [0, 0, 2, 2]\n\nProcessing each cell:\n\nFor row0, column0: cell is 2. Below (row1, column0) is 0. So convert to 1.\n\nRow0, column1: 2. Below is row1, column1 which is 2. No change.\n\nRow0, column2: 0. No change.\n\nRow0, column3: 2. Below (row1, column3) is 0. Convert to 1.\n\nRow1, column0: 0. No change.\n\nRow1, column1: 2. Below (row2, column1) is 0. Convert to 1.\n\nRow1, column2: 0. No change.\n\nRow1, column3: 0. No change.\n\nRow2, column0: 0. No change.\n\nRow2, column1: 0. No change.\n\nRow2, column2: 2. Below (row3, column2) is 0. Convert to 1.\n\nRow2, column3: 0. No change.\n\nRow3, column0: 2. Below (row4, column0) is 0. Convert to 1.\n\nRow3, column1: 0. No change.\n\nRow3, column2: 0. No change.\n\nRow3, column3: 0. No change.\n\nRow4, column0: 0. No change.\n\nRow4, column1: 0. No change.\n\nRow4, column2: 2. Below nothing. No change.\n\nRow4, column3: 2. Below nothing. No change.\n\nSo the converted cells are:\n\nRow0: [1,2,0,1]\n\nRow1: [0,1,0,0]\n\nRow2: [0,0,1,0]\n\nRow3: [1,0,0,0]\n\nRow4: [0,0,2,2]\n\nBut let's check against the training examples to see if this fits.\n\nIn Example3's input:\n\nRow1: [2,0,2]. The 2 in column0 is above row2's 0. So according to this rule, it should be converted. But in the output, it's not. Only the third column's 2 is converted. So this doesn't fit.\n\nBut perhaps the rule is that if a 2 has a 0 below, convert to 1, and if a 2 has a 0 above, convert to 1. So any vertical adjacency.\n\nBut this would result in more changes than observed. For example, in Example0's row2, column0: 2 has a 0 above. So converted. This fits. In Example3's row2, column1: 2 has a 0 above. So converted. This fits. But why in Example2's row4's 2s, which have 0s above, they are not converted?\n\nMaybe there's an additional condition: the 2 must be the only one in the column. Or perhaps the conversion only happens once per column.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is that only the first occurrence of a 2 with a 0 below is converted in each column.\n\nIn the test input, the changes would be:\n\nRow0, column0: converted (0 below).\n\nRow0, column3: converted (0 below).\n\nRow1, column1: converted (0 below).\n\nRow2, column2: converted (0 below).\n\nRow3, column0: converted (0 below).\n\nSo multiple conversions. But according to the training examples, like Example1, there are two conversions. Example3 has two conversions. So this might fit.\n\nBut applying this to the Test Input would result in the following output:\n\n[1, 2, 0, 1]\n\n[0, 1, 0, 0]\n\n[0, 0, 1, 0]\n\n[1, 0, 0, 0]\n\n[0, 0, 2, 2]\n\nBut looking back at the training examples, the outputs do not have multiple 1s in the same row unless the input has multiple qualifying 2s. For example, Example1's output has two 1s. So this seems possible.\n\nHowever, I need to compare with Example2. In Example2's input, the last row's 2s are in row4. They are above 0s in row3. So according to this rule, they should be converted. But in the output, they are not. So why? Maybe the rule is that only 2s with a 0 below are converted, not those with 0 above.\n\nIf that's the case, then:\n\nExample0's converted cell (row2, column0) has no cell below. So no. But in the output, it's converted. So that's a contradiction.\n\nBut in Example0's output, the 2 is converted to 1 even though there's no cell below. So this can't be.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and the need to provide an answer, I'll proceed with the hypothesis that any 2 with a 0 directly above or below is converted to 1. \n\nApplying this to the Test Input:\n\nRow0's column0 (2) has 0 below \u2192 convert to 1.\n\nRow0's column3 (2) has 0 below \u2192 convert to 1.\n\nRow1's column1 (2) has 0 below \u2192 convert to 1.\n\nRow2's column2 (2) has 0 below \u2192 convert to 1.\n\nRow3's column0 (2) has 0 below \u2192 convert to 1.\n\nRow4's columns2 and 3 (2s) have no cells below, so no change.\n\nThus, the output would be:\n\n[1, 2, 0, 1]\n\n[0, 1, 0, 0]\n\n[0, 0, 1, 0]\n\n[1, 0, 0, 0]\n\n[0, 0, 2, 2]\n\nBut looking at the training examples, this may not fit. For example, in Example2's input, the last row's 2s have 0s above, so they should be converted. But in the output, they are not. So there's a contradiction. But perhaps the rule is that only 2s with a 0 below are converted. Let's try that.\n\nThen, in the Test Input:\n\nRow0's column0 (2) has 0 below \u2192 convert.\n\nRow0's column3 (2) has 0 below \u2192 convert.\n\nRow1's column1 (2) has 0 below \u2192 convert.\n\nRow2's column2 (2) has 0 below \u2192 convert.\n\nRow3's column0 (2) has 0 below \u2192 convert.\n\nRow4's columns2 and 3 (2s) have no 0 below \u2192 no change.\n\nSame as before.\n\nBut in Example2's input, the 2 in row2's column3 (output converted) has a 0 below. So fits.\n\nThe last row's 2s in Example2's input have 0s above, not below. So according to this rule, they are not converted, which matches the output. Thus, the rule is: convert a 2 to 1 if there is a 0 directly below it.\n\nThis explains all examples:\n\nExample0: row2's column0 has no 0 below. But in the output, it's converted. So this rule doesn't fit. Thus, I'm back to square one.\n\nFinal desperate attempt: Perhaps the rule is to replace the first occurrence of 2 in each row when reading from right to left that is followed by a 0.\n\nExample0's row2: [2,0,0]. Reading right to left: first 2 is at position0. Next element is 0. So convert to 1.\n\nExample1's row2: [0,0,0,2]. Reading right to left, first 2 is at position3. Next element (row3, position3) is 0. Convert.\n\nRow3 in Example1: [0,2,0,0]. Reading right to left, first 2 is position1. Next element (row4, position1) is 2. No conversion. Wait, but in the output, it's converted. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, the last 2 in each row that has a 0 to the right.\n\nExample0's row2: [2,0,0]. The 2 is followed by 0. So convert.\n\nExample1's row2's last 2 is at column3. Followed by 0 (next row).\n\nExample3's row1: [2,0,2]. The last 2 is column2. Next row's column2 is 0. Convert.\n\nExample3's row2: [0,2,0]. The last 2 is column1. Next row's column1 is 2. No conversion. But in the output, it's converted. So this doesn't fit.\n\nI'm really stuck. Given the time I've spent and the need to answer, I'll proceed with the initial pattern I noticed: convert 2s that are vertically adjacent to 0s, either above or below, and apply it to the test input.\n\nThus, the Test Input's output would have 1s in positions where 2s are vertically adjacent to 0s:\n\nRow0: [2,2,0,2] \u2192 check each 2.\n\nColumn0: 2 has 0 below (row1) \u2192 1.\n\nColumn1: 2 has 2 below \u2192 no.\n\nColumn3: 2 has 0 below \u2192 1.\n\nRow1: [0,2,0,0] \u2192 column1's 2 has 0 below (row2) \u2192 1.\n\nRow2: [0,0,2,0] \u2192 column2's 2 has 0 below (row3) \u2192 1.\n\nRow3: [2,0,0,0] \u2192 column0's 2 has 0 below (row4) \u2192 1.\n\nRow4: [0,0,2,2] \u2192 no 0s below.\n\nSo the output would be:\n\n[1,2,0,1]\n\n[0,1,0,0]\n\n[0,0,1,0]\n\n[1,0,0,0]\n\n[0,0,2,2]\n\nBut looking at the training examples, this may not fit exactly, but it's the best I can do."
