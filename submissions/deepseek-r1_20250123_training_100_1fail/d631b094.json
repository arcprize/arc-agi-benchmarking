        "cot_1": "Okay, let's see. I need to figure out the pattern that transforms the input matrices into the output arrays. Let's look at the training examples one by one.\n\nStarting with Example 0:\n\nInput:\n[0, 0, 0]\n[1, 0, 0]\n[0, 1, 0]\n\nOutput: [1, 1]\n\nHmm. The output has two 1s. Let me check the input rows. Each row has a single non-zero element. The first row is all zeros, so maybe that's ignored. The second row has a 1 in the first position, and the third row has a 1 in the second position. So the output combines those? Like taking the non-zero elements from each row except the first? Wait, but the first row is all zeros. So maybe the output is the non-zero elements from each row, but how?\n\nWait, the output for Example 0 is [1,1]. The input's second row is [1,0,0], third row [0,1,0]. The non-zero elements are 1 and 1. So that's two 1s. So maybe the output is a list of all the non-zero elements in the input, but arranged in some order. Let me check the other examples.\n\nExample 1:\n\nInput:\n[0, 2, 0]\n[2, 0, 0]\n[0, 2, 0]\n\nOutput: [2,2,2]\n\nThe non-zero elements here are 2 (from first row), 2 (second row), 2 (third row). So output is [2,2,2]. That fits. So the pattern could be collecting all non-zero elements from each row, in order of the rows. But wait, in Example 0, the first row is all zeros, so it's skipped. So perhaps for each row, if there's a non-zero element, take it. But each row seems to have exactly one non-zero element. Let's check.\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput:\n[0,7,0]\n[0,0,0]\n[0,0,0]\n\nOutput: [7]\n\nOnly the first row has a 7. So output is [7]. That aligns with the idea of taking non-zero elements from each row, in order. The second and third rows have no non-zero elements, so they are omitted.\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput:\n[0,8,0]\n[8,8,0]\n[8,0,0]\n\nOutput: [8,8,8,8]\n\nFirst row has 8 in the middle. Second row has two 8s. Third row has an 8 first. So the non-zero elements are 8 (row1), 8 and 8 (row2), 8 (row3). That gives four 8s. So the output is concatenating all non-zero elements from each row, in order. So row by row, left to right, collect all non-zero elements.\n\nWait, in Example 3's second row [8,8,0], the non-zero elements are first and second positions. So that's two 8s. Third row is [8,0,0], so one 8. So output is 8 (from first row), then 8,8 (second), then 8 (third). So total of 4, which matches the output. So the pattern is: for each row, collect all non-zero elements in order, then concatenate all rows' non-zero elements in row order.\n\nBut let's verify with Example 0. The rows are:\n\nRow0: [0,0,0] \u2192 no elements \u2192 skipped.\n\nRow1: [1,0,0] \u2192 1.\n\nRow2: [0,1,0] \u2192 1.\n\nSo output [1,1], which matches.\n\nSimilarly, Example 1's rows:\n\nRow0: [0,2,0] \u2192 2.\n\nRow1: [2,0,0] \u2192 2.\n\nRow2: [0,2,0] \u2192 2.\n\nSo output [2,2,2].\n\nSo the pattern seems to be: for each row in the input matrix, collect all non-zero elements, in the order they appear from left to right. Then concatenate all these elements across all rows, in the order of the rows.\n\nNow, applying this to the test input.\n\nTest input:\n\n[4,4,0]\n[4,0,4]\n[0,0,4]\n\nSo let's process each row.\n\nFirst row: [4,4,0]. Non-zero elements are 4 and 4. So add [4,4].\n\nSecond row: [4,0,4]. Non-zero elements are 4 and 4. Add [4,4].\n\nThird row: [0,0,4]. Non-zero element is 4. Add [4].\n\nSo concatenating all, the output should be [4,4,4,4,4]. Let me check the length. The first row contributes 2, second 2, third 1 \u2192 total 5 elements. But let's see if any training example has multiple elements per row.\n\nLooking at Example 3's output: [8,8,8,8]. The second row had two 8s, and the third row one. So the pattern holds. So in the test case, the first row has two 4s, second row two 4s, third row one 4. So total of 2+2+1=5 elements. But wait, the test output examples don't have any example with 5 elements. Wait the examples given have outputs with varying lengths: example0 has 2, example1 has 3, example2 has 1, example3 has 4. So this seems possible.\n\nSo the output would be [4,4,4,4,4]. But let me check if that's correct.\n\nWait, the first row is [4,4,0] \u2192 4 and 4.\n\nSecond row [4,0,4] \u2192 4 and 4.\n\nThird row [0,0,4] \u2192 4.\n\nSo combining all: 4,4,4,4,4 \u2192 but the output would be [4,4,4,4,4]. However, looking at the training examples, the output is a list where each row's non-zero elements are added in order. So that's the case here.\n\nBut wait, maybe there's another pattern. Let me check again.\n\nWait, in example 3, the input is:\n\nRow0: [0,8,0] \u2192 8.\n\nRow1: [8,8,0] \u2192 8,8.\n\nRow2: [8,0,0] \u21928.\n\nSo output is [8,8,8,8], which is 4 elements. So 1+2+1=4.\n\nSimilarly, in the test case, 2+2+1=5. So the output should have 5 elements. So the answer is [4,4,4,4,4]. But wait, looking at the test input:\n\nFirst row: [4,4,0] \u2192 4,4.\n\nSecond row: [4,0,4] \u21924,4.\n\nThird row: [0,0,4] \u21924.\n\nSo combining all, the output should be [4,4,4,4,4]. But maybe there's a step I'm missing. Let me check if the examples have any other pattern. For instance, maybe only take the first non-zero element of each row.\n\nWait, example0: rows are 0,1,0. Output is [1,1], which would correspond to taking the first non-zero of each row? No. The first non-zero of row1 (second row) is 1, and row2 (third row) has first non-zero in position 1 (0-based index 1). So that would be two 1s. But example1's output is [2,2,2], which would be three elements, one from each row. So that fits. Example2 has one element. Example3 has four elements, which would be one from first row, two from second (since two non-zero elements), one from third. So that matches. So the pattern is to take all non-zero elements, in row order, left to right. So the test case's output would be [4,4,4,4,4]. \n\nBut let me check if the test input's rows are:\n\nFirst row: [4,4,0] \u2192 4,4.\n\nSecond row: [4,0,4] \u21924,4.\n\nThird row: [0,0,4] \u21924.\n\nSo combined, the output is [4,4,4,4,4]. But the format in the examples uses brackets. For example, Example0's output is [1,1], which is a list. So the correct answer would be [4,4,4,4,4].",

        "cot_2": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. So, we have these input matrices and their corresponding output arrays. The goal is to find out how the inputs are transformed into the outputs and then apply that to the test input.\n\nLooking at Example 0:\nInput is three rows:\n[0, 0, 0]\n[1, 0, 0]\n[0, 1, 0]\nOutput is [1, 1]. Hmm. Let's see. Maybe the output is collecting certain elements from the input. Let's check each example.\n\nIn Example 0's input, the first row has all zeros. The second row has a 1 in the first position. The third row has a 1 in the second position. The output has two 1s. So maybe each 1 in the second and third rows (excluding the first row) contributes to the output. But how?\n\nWait, maybe the output is formed by taking elements from the input matrix where the row above has a non-zero element. Let's check. For Example 0, the second row (index 1) has a 1 in position 0. The third row (index 2) has a 1 in position 1. The output is [1,1]. Maybe each element in a row (except the first row) is added to the output if the element directly above it is non-zero. Wait, that doesn't fit. Because in Example 0, the second row's 1 is in position 0. The row above (first row) at position 0 is 0. Hmm, maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's looking for the non-zero elements in each row and then combining them in some way. Let's check Example 0's input. The non-zero elements are 1 (second row, first position) and 1 (third row, second position). Output is two 1s. So maybe the output is all non-zero elements from all rows except the first? But wait, in Example 0, the first row is all zeros, so maybe they just take non-zero elements from any row. But Example 1 has input:\n\n[0,2,0]\n[2,0,0]\n[0,2,0]\nOutput [2,2,2]. The non-zero elements are 2 (first row, position 1), 2 (second row, position 0), and 2 (third row, position 1). So three 2s. The output is three 2s. That fits. So maybe the output is a list of all non-zero elements from the input matrix, in row-major order (left to right, top to bottom). Let's check other examples.\n\nExample 2:\nInput:\n[0,7,0]\n[0,0,0]\n[0,0,0]\nOutput [7]. So only the 7 in the first row is present. So if the output is all non-zero elements, then yes. So Example 2's output is [7], which matches.\n\nExample 3:\nInput:\n[0,8,0]\n[8,8,0]\n[8,0,0]\nOutput [8,8,8,8]. Non-zero elements are 8 (first row, position 1), 8 (second row, position 0), 8 (second row, position 1), and 8 (third row, position 0). That's four 8s, which matches the output.\n\nSo the pattern seems to be: collect all non-zero elements from the input matrix in row-major order (left to right, top to bottom) and output them as a list.\n\nNow, let's apply this to the test input:\n\nTest input:\n[4,4,0]\n[4,0,4]\n[0,0,4]\n\nSo, let's list all non-zero elements in row-major order.\n\nFirst row: 4,4 (positions 0 and 1)\nSecond row: 4 (position 0), 4 (position 2)\nThird row: 4 (position 2)\nSo combining them in order: 4,4,4,4,4. So the output should be [4,4,4,4,4].\n\nWait, but wait. Let's check the test input again. Let me write each row's elements:\n\nRow 0: 4,4,0 \u2192 non-zeros are 4,4\nRow 1: 4,0,4 \u2192 non-zeros are 4,4\nRow 2: 0,0,4 \u2192 non-zero is 4\n\nSo the list would be 4,4,4,4,4 \u2192 five 4s. So the output should be [4,4,4,4,4].\n\nBut let me cross-verify with the examples. For Example 1, the input has non-zero elements in first row (2), second row (2), third row (2), leading to three 2s. So yes, the output is collecting all non-zero elements in order.\n\nBut wait Example 3's output is [8,8,8,8]. Let me check the input for Example3:\n\nFirst row: 0,8,0 \u2192 8\nSecond row:8,8,0 \u2192 8,8\nThird row:8,0,0 \u21928\nTotal non-zero: 1+2+1=4 elements \u2192 output length 4, which matches. So yes.\n\nSo the test input's non-zeros are 2 (from first row) +2 (second row) +1 (third row) = 5 elements, all 4s. So the output should be [4,4,4,4,4]."
