        "cot_1": "Okay, let's see. I need to figure out the pattern here. Let me look at the training examples first.\n\nStarting with Example 0. The input is a 3x3 grid:\n\n[4,5,4]\n[5,5,5]\n[4,5,4]\n\nOutput is:\n\n[0,4,0]\n[4,4,4]\n[0,4,0]\n\nHmm, so what's happening here? Maybe comparing the input and output. Let's check each element. In the input, the numbers are 4 and 5. The output has 0s and 4s. So maybe wherever there's a 5 in the input, it's replaced with 4 in the output? But wait, not exactly. Wait, the output's non-zero elements are 4, which is the minimum value from the input? Let's see. The input has 4 and 5. The minimum is 4. So in the output, positions that were 5 in the input become 4, and the 4s become 0? Or maybe the other way around. Wait, in example 0's output, the center and middle row are 4s, which in the input were 5s. So maybe the 5s are replaced by the minimum value (4) and the 4s become 0. But how does that fit?\n\nWait, let's check Example 1. Input is a 5x5 grid with 5,6. Output has 6s and 0s. The minimum in the input is 5. So in the output, the 5s are replaced by 6 (the other number?), but the output has 6s where the input had 5s? Or maybe the maximum. Wait in example 0, input has 4 and 5. Output has 4s where the input had 5s, and 0 where input had 4. So maybe the rule is: For each element in the input, if the value is the maximum in the grid, replace it with the minimum value of the grid. Otherwise, set it to 0. Wait, let's check.\n\nIn Example 0, the input has 4 and 5. The maximum is 5. So any element equal to 5 (the max) becomes 4 (the min), and others become 0. So the output in Example 0 would indeed have 4s where there were 5s and 0s elsewhere. That fits.\n\nExample 1's input has 5 and 6. The max is 6, min is 5. So elements that are 5 (non-max) would become 0, and elements that are 6 (max) become 5. Wait, but in Example 1's output, the non-zero elements are 6. Wait that's conflicting. Because according to that logic, the max in the input is 6, so they should be replaced with the min (5). But the output has 6s. So maybe my initial hypothesis is wrong.\n\nWait let me re-examine Example 1. Input has elements 5 and 6. The output has 6s where the input had 5s? Let's see:\n\nOriginal input (example 1):\n\nFirst row of input: [5,5,6,6,6]\n\nOutput first row: [6,6,0,0,0]\n\nSo the first two elements in input are 5, output is 6. Then the next three are 6, output is 0. Wait, so 5 becomes 6, and 6 becomes 0? That's the opposite. So perhaps the rule is: if the element is the minimum in the grid, replace it with the maximum, and otherwise set to 0. Wait, let's see.\n\nIn example 0, input has 4 and 5. The min is 4, max is 5. So elements that are min (4) become max (5), but in the output they are 0. Wait no. Because in example 0, the output has 4s where input was 5. So maybe the other way around. Wait this is confusing.\n\nLet me take another approach. Let's look for each example what the transformation is.\n\nExample 0:\n\nInput elements: 4 and 5.\n\nOutput elements: 0 and 4.\n\nSo 5 becomes 4, 4 becomes 0.\n\nSo the replacement is: replace 5 with 4, and 4 with 0.\n\nBut why? Maybe because 4 is the minimum and 5 is the maximum. So perhaps replace max elements with min, and others with 0.\n\nIn example 0: replace 5 (max) with 4 (min), and 4 (others) become 0. So that matches.\n\nIn example 1: input elements 5 and 6. The min is 5, max is 6. So replace 6 (max) with 5 (min), and others (5) become 0? But the output in example 1 has 6s where the input was 5. Wait that doesn't fit. Because according to that logic, 6 (max) would be replaced with 5 (min), so in the output, the positions where input had 6 would be 5. But in example1's output, the first row is [6,6,0,0,0]. The original input first row was [5,5,6,6,6]. So in the output, the first two 5s became 6, and the 6s became 0. So the opposite of the previous example.\n\nHmm, that's conflicting. So maybe the pattern is different. Let's think again.\n\nAlternative approach: For each cell, if the cell's value is the same as the value of the cell directly above it (if any), then set it to 0, otherwise keep the value. No, that doesn't fit the examples.\n\nWait in example 0, the output's middle row is all 4s. The input's middle row was all 5s. So perhaps the middle row's elements are being set to the minimum value (4), and the other rows have their 5s replaced by 4 and 4s by 0. But how does that fit?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is a shifted version, but that doesn't explain the values.\n\nAnother idea: The output replaces the most frequent number with 0. But in example 0, input has 4s and 5s. The counts: 4 appears 4 times (corners and middle), 5 appears 5 times. The output replaces 5s with 4, and 4s with 0. So perhaps, if the number is the majority, it's replaced with the minority? Not sure.\n\nWait looking at Example 2:\n\nInput is a 5x5 grid with 9,5. Output has 9s and 0s.\n\nIn example2's input, let's see:\n\nFirst input row: [9,5,9,9,9]. Output first row: [0,9,0,0,0]. So 5 in input becomes 9 in output. 9 becomes 0.\n\nSo the 5s are being replaced by 9, and 9s by 0. But why?\n\nLooking at the input for example2, the numbers are 9 and 5. The min is 5, max is 9. So perhaps again, replacing the max (9) with min (5) and others (5) with 0. But no. Because in example2's output, the 5s in the input become 9 in the output, which is the max. So that contradicts the previous idea.\n\nHmm. This is tricky. Let's see if there's another pattern. Maybe looking for the number that is not the maximum, but occurs the least. Like, in example0, input has 4 and5. The 4 appears 4 times, 5 appears 5 times. The output replaces 5 (majority) with 4 (minority), and 4 becomes 0. So maybe the majority value is replaced by the minority's value, and the minority's value becomes 0. But in example1, the input has 5 and 6. Let's count:\n\nExample1 input is a 5x5 grid. Let's count the numbers:\n\nOriginal input rows:\n\nRow1: 5,5,6,6,6 \u2192 2 5s, 3 6s\n\nRow2:6,5,5,6,6 \u2192 2 5s, 3 6s\n\nRow3:6,6,5,5,6 \u2192 2 5s, 3 6s\n\nRow4:6,6,6,5,5 \u2192 2 5s, 3 6s\n\nRow5:5,6,6,6,5 \u2192 2 5s, 3 6s\n\nTotal 5s: 2*5 rows \u2192 10 5s? Wait no. Let me recount:\n\nRow1: 5,5,6,6,6 \u2192 5 appears 2 times.\n\nRow2:6,5,5,6,6 \u2192 5 appears 2.\n\nRow3:6,6,5,5,6 \u2192 5 appears 2.\n\nRow4:6,6,6,5,5 \u2192 5 appears 2.\n\nRow5:5,6,6,6,5 \u2192 5 appears 3 (positions 0, 4, and 5? Wait the row is [5,6,6,6,5] \u2192 5s at index 0 and 4. So 2 times.\n\nWait total 5s: 2+2+2+2+2=10. 6s: each row has 3, so 3*5=15. So majority is 6 (15), minority is 5 (10). So in the output, the majority (6) would be replaced by the minority (5), and minority (5) replaced by 0. But in the output of example1, the 5s in input are replaced by 6, and 6s by 0. So that's the opposite. So that theory doesn't hold.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is replacing the minority value with the majority value, and others with 0. In example0, the minority is 4 (4 times), majority 5 (5 times). So replace 4 with 5, 5 with 0. But the output in example0 has 5s replaced by 4 and 4s replaced by 0. Which is the opposite. So that's not matching.\n\nWait this is getting confusing. Let's try another approach. Let's look for each example, which numbers in the input are converted to which in the output.\n\nExample0:\n\nInput numbers:4,5.\n\nOutput numbers:0,4.\n\nSo 5\u21924, 4\u21920.\n\nExample1:\n\nInput numbers:5,6.\n\nOutput numbers:0,6.\n\nSo 5\u21926, 6\u21920.\n\nExample2:\n\nInput numbers:5,9.\n\nOutput numbers:0,9.\n\nSo 5\u21929, 9\u21920.\n\nAh! So in each example, the two distinct values in the input are X and Y. The output replaces X with Y, and Y with 0. But wait, in example0, X is 4 and Y is5. Wait no, because in the output, the 5s in input are replaced with 4, and 4s become 0. So perhaps, the higher value is replaced with the lower, and the lower becomes 0. Let's check.\n\nIn example0, X=4 and Y=5. So higher is 5. So 5 is replaced with 4 (lower), and 4 becomes 0. That fits.\n\nIn example1, input has 5 and 6. Higher is 6. So 6 is replaced with 5 (lower), but in the output, the 5s are replaced with 6. Wait that's conflicting. Wait example1's output has 6s where the input had 5s. So 5\u21926, 6\u21920. So higher number (6) is replaced with 0, and lower (5) replaced with higher (6). That seems to be the case.\n\nWait in example1, the 5s become 6, and 6s become 0. So for each input element, if it's the lower of the two distinct values (5), then replace it with the higher (6), else (if it's 6) replace with 0.\n\nSimilarly in example0: the lower is4, higher is5. Replace 4 with higher (5) becomes no. Because in example0's output, the 5s are replaced with4. So this seems inconsistent.\n\nWait this is inconsistent. So perhaps another angle.\n\nLooking at all three examples:\n\nIn each case, the output has two distinct numbers: 0 and another number.\n\nIn example0, output uses 4 and 0. The input had 4 and5.\n\nIn example1, output uses 6 and0. Input had5 and6.\n\nIn example2, output uses9 and0. Input had5 and9.\n\nSo the non-zero number in the output is the higher of the two input numbers.\n\nAh! So perhaps the transformation is: replace all occurrences of the lower number with the higher number, and replace the higher number with 0.\n\nWait let's check:\n\nExample0:\n\nInput numbers:4 and5. Lower is4, higher is5. Replace lower (4) with higher (5), and higher (5) with0.\n\nBut in example0's output, the 4s are replaced with0, and 5s with4. So that's not matching.\n\nWait example0's output has 4s where input had5s, and 0 where input had4s. So perhaps the opposite: replace higher number with lower, lower with0.\n\nSo in example0: higher is5. Replace 5s with4, and4s with0. Which matches.\n\nExample1: higher is6. Replace6s with0, and5s with6. So input5 becomes6, input6 becomes0. Which matches the output.\n\nExample2: higher is9, lower is5. Replace5s with9, and9s with0. Which matches the output.\n\nYes! So the pattern is:\n\n- In the input grid, there are two distinct numbers. Let's call them A and B, where A < B.\n\n- In the output, every occurrence of A (the smaller number) is replaced with B (the larger number), and every occurrence of B is replaced with 0.\n\nSo the transformation is:\n\nFor each element in the input:\n\nIf the element is A (the smaller of the two distinct numbers), replace it with B.\n\nIf the element is B (the larger), replace it with 0.\n\nSo for example, in example0, A=4, B=5. 4\u21925 (but output shows 4\u21920 and 5\u21924. Wait wait, no. Wait example0's input has 4 and5. According to this pattern, the output should replace4 (A) with5 (B) and 5 (B) with0. But the actual output for example0 is:\n\n[0,4,0]\n\n[4,4,4]\n\n[0,4,0]\n\nWhich suggests that in the output, the 5s (B) are replaced with4 (A?), and 4s are replaced with0. But according to the pattern I thought, B (5) would become0 and A (4) would become5.\n\nSo this contradicts. So my hypothesis is wrong.\n\nWait I'm getting this mixed up. Let me re-examine example0's input and output.\n\nInput:\n\n[4,5,4]\n\n[5,5,5]\n\n[4,5,4]\n\nOutput:\n\n[0,4,0]\n\n[4,4,4]\n\n[0,4,0]\n\nSo in the input, 4 and5 are the two distinct numbers. So according to the output, where input has 5, output is4. Where input has4, output is0.\n\nSo that's like: replace 5 with4, and4 with0.\n\nSo how is this determined?\n\nThe two numbers are4 and5. The difference is1. But why replace5 with4, and4 with0?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule is:\n\nFor each cell, the output is the value of the cell if it's the same as the cell below it (or some positional relation), otherwise 0. But that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternative approach: perhaps the output is generated by some kind of rotation or shift. But example0's input is a 3x3 grid. The output has a cross of 4s and 0s elsewhere. But the input's cross is 5s and corners are4. So perhaps the output is the input's cross (middle row and column) replaced with the smaller number and the rest 0? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the minimum value of the grid, placed in positions where the input had the maximum value, and zero elsewhere.\n\nIn example0, min is4, max is5. So wherever input had5 (max), output is4. Elsewhere, 0. Which matches example0.\n\nIn example1, the input has5 and6. Min5, max6. So replace all6s with5 and others (5) with0. But example1's output is replacing5 with6 and6 with0. Wait no. Because example1's output has6s where input was5. So that's opposite.\n\nSo this theory is invalid.\n\nHmm. Let's try again. Let's look at example1's output.\n\nExample1 input:\n\n[5,5,6,6,6]\n\n[6,5,5,6,6]\n\n[6,6,5,5,6]\n\n[6,6,6,5,5]\n\n[5,6,6,6,5]\n\nOutput:\n\n[6,6,0,0,0]\n\n[0,6,6,0,0]\n\n[0,0,6,6,0]\n\n[0,0,0,6,6]\n\n[6,0,0,0,6]\n\nLooking at the output, the 6s form a diagonal pattern. Each row's 6s are shifted one position to the right compared to the previous row. So first row starts at positions 0 and 1, next row starts at 1 and 2, etc. This seems like a kind of diagonal or shifted pattern. But how does that relate to the input?\n\nLooking at the input for example1, the 5s are in certain positions. The output replaces those 5s with 6s, and 6s with 0. So in example1, wherever there's a5 in the input, it becomes6, and6 becomes0. So the output's 6s are the positions where the input had5s, and 0s where input had6s.\n\nSo the pattern here is: swap the two numbers and set the higher one to 0. Wait, let me see.\n\nWait in example0, input has4 and5. Output replaces5\u21924 and4\u21920.\n\nIn example1, input5\u21926 and6\u21920.\n\nIn example2, input5\u21929 and9\u21920.\n\nSo the pattern is: take the two distinct values in the input, X and Y. Let\u2019s say X is the one that is being replaced by Y, and Y is replaced by0. Wait, but how are X and Y determined?\n\nIn example0, X is5 and Y is4. But no, because the output replaces5 with4. So X is5 (the higher value) becomes4 (the lower), and Y is4 becomes0.\n\nBut how to determine which value becomes which? Maybe the rule is: the lesser of the two values in the input becomes0, and the greater becomes the lesser.\n\nWait example0:\n\nInput values4 and5. Output: 5\u21924 and4\u21920. So the greater value (5) is replaced by the lesser (4), and the lesser (4) is replaced by0.\n\nExample1: input5 and6. Greater is6. Replace6 with0, and5 with6. Wait, but example1's output has5s replaced by6, and6s replaced by0. So that's the same as: the lesser (5) is replaced by the greater (6), and the greater (6) is replaced by0.\n\nBut that's the opposite of example0.\n\nSo now I'm really confused. How can the same pattern apply here? Let's list all examples:\n\nExample0:\n\nInput values:4 and5 (4<5).\n\nOutput: 5\u21924, 4\u21920.\n\nExample1:\n\nInput values:5 and6 (5<6).\n\nOutput:5\u21926, 6\u21920.\n\nExample2:\n\nInput values:5 and9 (5<9).\n\nOutput:5\u21929, 9\u21920.\n\nAh! So the pattern is:\n\n- For the two distinct values in the input, replace the smaller value (A) with the larger value (B), and replace the larger value (B) with 0.\n\nSo for example, in example0:\n\nA=4 (smaller), B=5 (larger). So all 4s become B (5?), but no, the output shows that 5s become4. Wait no. Wait no, in example0's output, the input's 5s are replaced with4 (smaller), and 4s are replaced with0. So this contradicts.\n\nWait but according to the examples:\n\nIn example1, the smaller value is5, larger is6. The output replaces 5 with6 and 6 with0. Which matches.\n\nIn example2, smaller is5, larger is9. Output replaces5 with9 and9 with0. Which matches.\n\nBut example0 is the opposite: smaller is4, larger is5. Output replaces5 with4 and4 with0. So in example0, the larger is5 and it's replaced with4 (the smaller), and the smaller is4 replaced with0.\n\nSo this seems inconsistent. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is to replace the more frequent number with the less frequent number, and the less frequent with0. Let's check.\n\nExample0:\n\nInput has4 appearing 4 times,5 appearing5 times. So5 is more frequent. Replace5 with4 (less frequent), and4 with0. That fits.\n\nExample1:\n\nInput has5 appearing10 times,6 appearing15 times. So replace6 (more frequent) with5 (less), and5 becomes0. But in example1's output,5 is replaced with6 (more frequent), which contradicts.\n\nNo, that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, the pattern is that the number which is not the minimum is replaced by the minimum, and the minimum is replaced by0. Wait example0: min is4. So replace non-min (5) with4, and min (4) with0. Which fits.\n\nExample1: min is5. Replace non-min (6) with5, and5 becomes0. But in example1's output, the non-min (6) is replaced by0, and min (5) replaced by6. So opposite.\n\nSo this theory doesn't hold.\n\nHmm. Let's think differently. Looking at the output arrays, they seem to form a pattern where the non-zero elements are arranged in a diagonal or specific pattern.\n\nIn example1's output, the 6s form a diagonal band that shifts right each row. Similarly, example2's output has 9s in certain positions, and example0 has a cross.\n\nBut how does this relate to the input?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is a rotated version of the input, but with values changed. But example0's input is a cross of5s and border of4s, output is cross of4s and0s. So perhaps the output is the input where the center cross is replaced by the minimum value and others are0.\n\nBut how to explain example1 and 2?\n\nAnother approach: for each cell, if it is part of a certain structure (like a diagonal, a cross, etc.) then set to a specific value, else 0.\n\nBut without knowing the structure, it's hard to predict.\n\nWait perhaps the output is derived by looking at the positions where the input's value is not the same as the next value in some direction. But this is too vague.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each cell in the output is the sum of its adjacent cells in the input modulo some number, but that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, think of the output as a mask where the non-zero elements are where the input had a certain value, but that value is now replaced by another.\n\nIn example0, the output's non-zero elements are where the input had5. Those positions are replaced with4. The 4s in input become0.\n\nIn example1, the non-zero elements are where input had5. Those are replaced with6. The 6s in input become0.\n\nIn example2, the non-zero elements are where input had5. Replaced with9. The9s become0.\n\nSo the pattern is: for each cell, if the input value is the minimum of the two distinct values in the input grid, replace it with the maximum value. Otherwise (if it's the maximum value), replace it with0.\n\nWait example0:\n\nThe two distinct values are4 and5. Min is4. So cells with4 (min) are replaced with5 (max), but example0's output shows that the input's5s are replaced with4. So no, this is the opposite.\n\nWait example0's input has min4. Output's non-zero elements are where input has5. So that's max. So perhaps the rule is: replace max with min, and min with0.\n\nExample0: max5\u21924, min4\u21920. Which matches.\n\nExample1: max6\u21925, min5\u21920. But example1's output has5\u21926 and6\u21920. So that's the opposite. Because if max is6, replace with5, but output replaces5\u21926.\n\nHmm. This is confusing.\n\nLet me make a table of the examples:\n\n| Example | Input Values | Output Values | Transformation |\n|---------|--------------|---------------|----------------|\n| 0       | 4,5          |0,4            |5\u21924,4\u21920         |\n| 1       |5,6           |0,6            |5\u21926,6\u21920         |\n| 2       |5,9           |0,9            |5\u21929,9\u21920         |\n\nSo the pattern here is that the lower input value is replaced by the higher, and the higher is replaced by 0.\n\nWait example0: lower is4, higher is5. Output:4\u21920,5\u21924. So that's not replacing lower with higher. Wait no. Because 4 is replaced with0,5 is replaced with4.\n\nSo it's swapping the two values and setting the higher one to 0.\n\nWait, for example0:\n\nOriginal values:4 and5. Swap them to5 and4, then set the higher (5) to0. But how does that work? Because after swapping, the new values would be5\u21924,4\u21925. Then set the higher (5) to0, resulting in4 and0.\n\nSo for each cell, if the original value is4 (lower), it becomes5 (higher), then if the value is higher than the new swapped value, set to0. No, this doesn't make sense.\n\nAlternatively, the pattern is that for each cell, the output is the maximum of the two input values if the cell's value is the minimum, otherwise 0. But how?\n\nIn example0, cell with4 (min) becomes0. Cell with5 (max) becomes4 (min). So no.\n\nThis is really tricky. Let me try to find another pattern.\n\nLooking at the outputs:\n\nIn example0, the output has the same positions as the input's max values (5s) replaced with the min (4), and the min's positions replaced with0.\n\nIn example1, the input's min is5, max is6. The output has the positions where input was5 replaced with6, and6 replaced with0.\n\nIn example2, input's min is5, max is9. Output has5 replaced with9, and9 replaced with0.\n\nAh! So the rule is:\n\nFor each cell:\n\n- If the cell's value is the minimum of the two distinct values in the input grid, replace it with the maximum value.\n\n- If the cell's value is the maximum of the two distinct values, replace it with 0.\n\nSo:\n\nIn example0:\n\nmin=4, max=5.\n\nCells with4 (min) become5, but output shows cells with4 become0. So that's not it.\n\nWait no. In example0's output, cells that were5 (max) become4 (min), and cells that were4 (min) become0. So the opposite.\n\nWait so the rule is:\n\nFor each cell:\n\n- If the cell's value is the max, replace it with the min.\n\n- If it's the min, replace with0.\n\nYes! That fits.\n\nExample0:\n\nmax is5 \u2192 replace with4 (min), min is4 \u2192 replace with0.\n\nExample1:\n\nmax is6 \u2192 replace with5 (min), min is5 \u2192 replace with0.\n\nBut wait example1's output shows that the 5s are replaced with6. This contradicts.\n\nWait no. Because in example1's input, the max is6. According to the rule, any cell with6 (max) becomes5 (min), and cells with5 (min) become0. But example1's output has 6s where the input had5s, and 0s where input had6s. So this is the opposite of the rule.\n\nSo this is not matching.\n\nBut in example0, the rule works: max becomes min, min becomes0.\n\nExample1's output is the opposite: min becomes max, max becomes0.\n\nExample2's output: min (5) becomes max (9), max becomes0.\n\nSo the pattern here is: for each cell, if the value is the min, replace it with the max. If it's the max, replace with0.\n\nYes! This seems to fit all examples.\n\nExample0:\n\nInput values4 (min) and5 (max).\n\nReplace min (4) with max (5) \u2192 no, because in example0's output, the 5s (max) are replaced with4 (min), and the 4s (min) are replaced with0.\n\nHmm. So that's not the case.\n\nWait example0's input is:\n\nRow0:4,5,4 \u2192 these are min, max, min.\n\nOutput row0:0,4,0 \u2192 which would imply that min (4) is replaced with0, and max (5) replaced with4.\n\nSo the rule here is: replace max with min, and min with0.\n\nExample1:\n\nInput has5 (min) and6 (max). Output replaces max (6) with0, min (5) with6.\n\nSo the rule is: replace min with max, and max with0.\n\nSo this is conflicting with example0.\n\nWait this can't be. So what is the correct pattern?\n\nLooking at all examples:\n\nExample0:\n\nInput:4 and5.\n\nOutput:5\u21924, 4\u21920.\n\nExample1:\n\nInput:5 and6.\n\nOutput:5\u21926,6\u21920.\n\nExample2:\n\nInput:5 and9.\n\nOutput:5\u21929,9\u21920.\n\nAh! So the pattern is: replace the smaller of the two numbers with the larger one, and the larger with0.\n\nYes! So for any input cell:\n\n- If the cell's value is the smaller of the two distinct values, replace it with the larger.\n\n- If the cell's value is the larger of the two, replace it with0.\n\nThis fits all examples.\n\nExample0: smaller is4, larger is5. So 4\u21925 and5\u21920. But wait example0's output is 5s replaced with4, and4\u21920. So this doesn't fit.\n\nWait no. Wait in example0's input, the two distinct values are4 and5. The output has 5s replaced with4, and4s replaced with0. So according to this, the larger value (5) is replaced with the smaller (4), and smaller (4) is replaced with0.\n\nBut this contradicts the other examples.\n\nWait example1: input5 and6. Output5\u21926,6\u21920. So the smaller (5) is replaced with6 (larger), larger (6)\u21920. Which fits the pattern. So why is example0 different?\n\nAh, maybe there's a mistake in how I'm interpreting the examples.\n\nWait in example0, the two distinct values are4 and5. According to the pattern from example1 and2, the output should be4 replaced with5, and5 replaced with0. But example0's output is5 replaced with4 and4 replaced with0. So this is conflicting.\n\nBut how can all examples fit the same pattern? There must be a different rule.\n\nAnother possibility: the pattern is that the output's non-zero value is the second largest number in the input. For example0, input has4 and5. Second largest is4. So non-zero is4. For example1, input5 and6. Second largest is5. But output uses6. So no.\n\nAlternatively, the output's non-zero is the maximum of the input. But example0's maximum is5, but output uses4. So that's not it.\n\nWait maybe the pattern is to replace each number with the difference between the two numbers, but set to zero if the number is the higher one.\n\nFor example0: higher is5. 5-4=1. So replace5 with1 and4 with0. But example0's output is4 and0, so that doesn't fit.\n\nThis is really challenging. Let me try to think of another approach.\n\nLooking at example0's output:\n\nOriginal input grid:\n\nRow0:4,5,4 \u2192 becomes0,4,0.\n\nRow1:5,5,5 \u2192 becomes4,4,4.\n\nRow2:4,5,4 \u2192 becomes0,4,0.\n\nSo the output's non-zero is4, which is the minimum of the input's values (4 and5).\n\nSo, for each cell in the input:\n\nIf the cell's value is the maximum (5), replace it with the minimum (4). If it's the minimum (4), replace with0.\n\nThis fits example0.\n\nExample1: input has5 and6. The minimum is5. So replace6 with5 and5 with0. But example1's output replaces5 with6 and6 with0. So opposite.\n\nExample2: input has5 and9. Minimum is5. So replace9 with5 and5 with0. But example2's output replaces5 with9 and9 with0. Again opposite.\n\nSo this is conflicting. Why are some examples replacing max with min and others min with max?\n\nIs there any other way to determine which to use?\n\nLooking at the input grids:\n\nExample0: the maximum (5) appears more frequently than the minimum (4). The output replaces the more frequent (5) with the less frequent (4), and the less frequent (4) with0. But example1's input has5 appearing 10 times and6 15 times. So more frequent is6. Output replaces6 with0 and5 with6. So it's replacing the more frequent with0 and the less frequent with the more frequent's value.\n\nExample2: input has5 and9. Count how many times each appears. Let's see example2's input:\n\nFirst row:9,5,9,9,9 \u2192 5 once, 9 four times.\n\nRow2:9,9,5,5,9 \u21925 twice,9 three times.\n\nRow3:9,5,9,9,9 \u21925 once,9 four times.\n\nRow4:9,9,5,9,9 \u21925 once,9 four times.\n\nRow5:9,9,9,5,5 \u21925 twice,9 three times.\n\nTotal 5s: 1+2+1+1+2=7.\n\n9s: each row's 9 count is4,3,4,4,3. Total4+3+4+4+3=18.\n\nSo more frequent is9 (18 times), less frequent is5 (7).\n\nOutput example2:5\u21929,9\u21920. So replacing the less frequent (5) with the more frequent (9), and the more frequent (9) with0.\n\nSo the pattern seems to be:\n\n- For each cell, if the cell's value is the less frequent of the two, replace it with the more frequent value.\n\n- If the cell's value is the more frequent, replace it with0.\n\nYes! This fits all examples.\n\nExample0:\n\nInput has4 (4 times) and5 (5 times). More frequent is5.\n\nOutput replaces4 (less frequent) with5, and5 (more) with0. But example0's output replaces5 with4 and4 with0. So this is opposite.\n\nHmm, this is not matching.\n\nExample1: more frequent is6 (15 times). Less is5 (10). So replace5 with6 and6 with0. Which matches example1's output.\n\nExample2: more frequent is9 (18), less is5 (7). So replace5 with9 and9 with0. Which matches example2's output.\n\nExample0: more frequent is5 (5 times), less is4 (4 times). So replace4 with5 and5 with0. But the output for example0 is the opposite: replace5 with4 and4 with0.\n\nSo this pattern works for examples1 and 2, but not example0.\n\nSo why the inconsistency?\n\nWait perhaps the pattern is different. Let's check example0 again. The input is a 3x3 grid. The output's non-zero value is4, which is the less frequent (4 appears4 times,5 appears5 times). So why in example0, the less frequent is4, but it's replaced with0, and more frequent (5) is replaced with4.\n\nThis contradicts the pattern observed in examples1 and2.\n\nSo maybe there's another factor. Let's consider the parity of the number of distinct values. Or perhaps the minimum value is being used when certain conditions are met.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the pattern is to replace the second unique value encountered with the first, and the first with0. But how are the values ordered?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the pattern is to replace the value that appears in the first row, first column with the other value and vice versa.\n\nIn example0's input, the first element is4. So replace4 with0 and5 with4.\n\nIn example1's input, first element is5. Replace5 with6 and6 with0.\n\nIn example2's input, first element is9. Replace9 with0 and5 with9. But example2's output is5\u21929 and9\u21920. So yes. So perhaps the rule is:\n\nThe value that is in the first position of the first row is replaced with0, and the other value is replaced with the first position's value.\n\nExample0's first cell is4. So replace all4s with0, and5s with4.\n\nWhich matches the output.\n\nExample1's first cell is5. Replace all5s with0 and6s with5. But example1's output replaces5s with6 and6s with0. So this is the opposite.\n\nHmm. Not quite.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the first unique value in the grid is replaced with the second, and the second with0.\n\nIn example0, the two values are4 and5. Let's say the order is4 then5. So replace4 with5,5 with0. But the output shows5\u21924,4\u21920. So not matching.\n\nThis is really challenging. Let's try to find another way.\n\nLet me look at the test input and see if I can find the pattern.\n\nTest Input:\n\n[3,3,3,5,3]\n\n[3,5,3,3,3]\n\n[3,5,5,3,5]\n\n[3,3,3,5,3]\n\n[5,5,5,3,3]\n\nSo the two distinct values are3 and5.\n\nAccording to the pattern from example1 and2:\n\nIf the more frequent value is replaced with0, and the less with the more's value.\n\nLet's count the frequency.\n\nIn the test input:\n\nRow0:3 appears4 times,5 once.\n\nRow1:3 appears4 times,5 once.\n\nRow2:3 appears2 times,5 three times.\n\nRow3:3 appears4 times,5 once.\n\nRow4:3 appears2 times,5 three times.\n\nTotal3s:4+4+2+4+2=16.\n\n5s:1+1+3+1+3=9.\n\nSo more frequent is3 (16 times), less is5 (9).\n\nSo according to examples1 and2's pattern, replace5 (less) with3 (more), and3 (more) with0.\n\nSo output would have 5s replaced with3 and3s replaced with0. But looking at the examples, in example1 and2, the more frequent value is replaced with0 and the less with more.\n\nSo in the test input's case, the output would have 3s replaced with0 and5s replaced with3. So the output for each cell:\n\nIf input is3 \u21920.\n\nIf input is5 \u21923.\n\nBut let's check how this would look.\n\nOriginal test input rows:\n\nRow0: [3,3,3,5,3] \u2192 replaced to [0,0,0,3,0]\n\nRow1: [3,5,3,3,3] \u2192 [0,3,0,0,0]\n\nRow2: [3,5,5,3,5] \u2192 [0,3,3,0,3]\n\nRow3: [3,3,3,5,3] \u2192 [0,0,0,3,0]\n\nRow4: [5,5,5,3,3] \u2192 [3,3,3,0,0]\n\nBut looking at the examples' outputs, like example1's output has the non-zero values arranged in a diagonal pattern. So maybe the test input's output would have 3s where the input had5s, and0 elsewhere. But arranged in some pattern.\n\nBut according to this pattern, the output would be:\n\nEach 3 becomes0, each5 becomes3.\n\nSo for example, the first row of test input would become [0,0,0,3,0].\n\nBut let's compare with example1's output, which is:\n\n[6,6,0,0,0]\n\n[0,6,6,0,0]\n\n[0,0,6,6,0]\n\n[0,0,0,6,6]\n\n[6,0,0,0,6]\n\nIn example1's output, the non-zero elements (6) form a diagonal band. So perhaps the arrangement is such that each row's non-zero elements are shifted right by the row index.\n\nBut how does this relate to the input's positions of the less frequent value.\n\nIn example1's input, the less frequent value is5, which appears in certain positions, and the output replaces those with6. So the output's non-zero elements are where the input had5s. So if the test input's output has non-zero elements where the input had5s, replaced with3, then the output would look like:\n\nOriginal test input's5 positions:\n\nRow0: index3.\n\nRow1: index1.\n\nRow2: indices1,2,4.\n\nRow3: index3.\n\nRow4: indices0,1,2.\n\nReplacing those with3, others with0:\n\nOutput would be:\n\n[0,0,0,3,0]\n\n[0,3,0,0,0]\n\n[0,3,3,0,3]\n\n[0,0,0,3,0]\n\n[3,3,3,0,0]\n\nBut the test input's row4 has three5s at the beginning, so their positions become3.\n\nBut in the examples, especially example1 and2, the outputs have the non-zero elements forming a pattern. For example1, the non-zero elements form a diagonal that shifts right each row. Similarly, example2's output has non-zero elements arranged in certain positions.\n\nLooking at the test input's5 positions:\n\nRow0:5 at index3.\n\nRow1:5 at index1.\n\nRow2:5 at indexes1,2,4.\n\nRow3:5 at index3.\n\nRow4:5 at indexes0,1,2.\n\nThe output would have 3s at these positions. So the output would have:\n\nRow0: [0,0,0,3,0]\n\nRow1: [0,3,0,0,0]\n\nRow2: [0,3,3,0,3]\n\nRow3: [0,0,0,3,0]\n\nRow4: [3,3,3,0,0]\n\nBut when I look at the training examples, like example1's output, it's a diagonal pattern. So perhaps the output is not just replacing the less frequent value with the more frequent, but also arranging them in a specific way.\n\nWait, but how does that relate to the input? Because in example1's input, the5s are arranged in a pattern that, when replaced with6 and the6s with0, creates the diagonal shifting pattern. So the positions of the5s in the input must form that pattern.\n\nSo the test input's5 positions may form a pattern that when replaced with3 and others with0, creates a certain structure. But the test input's5s are scattered. For example, row4 has the first three elements as5.\n\nSo the output would have the first three elements of row4 as3, others as0.\n\nBut according to the pattern observed in the examples, perhaps there's a different rule.\n\nBut the key is that according to the examples, the rule is to replace the less frequent value (if there are two distinct values) with the more frequent, and the more frequent with0. But example0 contradicts this. So perhaps there's a different rule.\n\nBut given that example0 is a 3x3 grid, maybe the pattern is different for even and odd sized grids. But that seems unlikely.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule is to replace the smaller value with the larger and the larger with0. This fits example1 and2, but example0 contradicts.\n\nBut in example0, the output's non-zero is4, which is the smaller of4 and5. So why is it replaced?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule is to replace the value that appears in the corners of the grid. For example0, the corners are4. So replace4 with0, and5 (non-corner) with4. But this is not applicable to other examples.\n\nAlternatively, the rule is to find the value that is in the center of the grid and replace other values with0. But in example0's input, the center is5. Output center is4. So that doesn't fit.\n\nThis is really challenging. Given the time I've spent, I think the pattern is:\n\n- For each cell, if the cell's value is the less frequent of the two distinct values, replace it with the more frequent value. Replace the more frequent value with0.\n\nSo for example, in example0, the less frequent is4 (4 times), more frequent is5 (5 times). Replace4 with5,5 with0. But example0's output shows the opposite. So this can't be.\n\nBut in example1 and2, this rule holds.\n\nAlternatively, the pattern is to replace the more frequent value with0, and the less frequent with the more frequent. So:\n\nIn example0: more frequent is5. Replace5 with0,4 with5. Which would result in output where original5s are0 and4s are5. But example0's output has4s where5s were and0s elsewhere. So this would not match.\n\nBut example1: more frequent is6. Replace6 with0,5 with6. Which matches the output.\n\nExample2: more frequent is9. Replace9 with0,5 with9. Which matches.\n\nExample0: more frequent is5. Replace5 with0,4 with5. So output would have 4s replaced with5,5s replaced with0. But example0's output has5s replaced with4, and4s replaced with0. So this doesn't fit.\n\nSo this is conflicting. Why is example0 different?\n\nLooking back at example0's input:\n\nIt's a 3x3 grid. The input is:\n\n4 5 4\n\n5 5 5\n\n4 5 4\n\nOutput:\n\n0 4 0\n\n4 4 4\n\n0 4 0\n\nSo the output's non-zero values are4, which is the less frequent value in the input. So why is the less frequent value used as the replacement?\n\nThis suggests that the pattern isn't consistent with the other examples. So perhaps there's a different rule.\n\nAlternative idea: the output is formed by taking the minimum value from the input and placing it in positions where the input had the maximum, and zero elsewhere. For example0, min is4, max is5. So where input had5, output is4. Elsewhere 0. Which matches.\n\nExample1: min is5, max is6. So where input had6, output is5. Elsewhere 0. But example1's output has6s where input had5, which would not match.\n\nHmm. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, the output is formed by taking the maximum value from the input and placing it in positions where the input had the minimum, and zero elsewhere.\n\nExample0: max is5, min is4. So where input had4, output is5. Elsewhere0. But example0's output is the opposite.\n\nNo.\n\nAfter trying many approaches, I think the correct pattern is:\n\n- For each cell in the input, if the value is the smaller of the two distinct values, replace it with the larger. If it's the larger, replace with0.\n\nThis fits examples1 and2, but not example0.\n\nBut example0 is different. Why?\n\nWait perhaps in example0, the two values are4 and5. But the output replaces5 with4 and4 with0. So the opposite of the pattern.\n\nBut why?\n\nLooking at the input for example0, it's a cross shape. The middle row and column are5s. Corners are4s.\n\nOutput is the same cross, but with5s replaced with4 and4s replaced with0.\n\nBut this doesn't explain why the pattern is different.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the pattern is to create a border of0s around the cross of the non-zero values. But this is specific to example0.\n\nBut the other examples have different patterns.\n\nAlternatively, the pattern is to replace each occurrence of the higher value with the lower and lower with0. So example0's output is correct. Examples1 and2 would have higher values replaced with lower, lower with0. But no, example1's output replaces lower (5) with higher (6), and higher with0. So this is conflicting.\n\nAt this point, given the time I've spent, I think the correct pattern is that the output replaces the smaller of the two distinct values with the larger, and the larger with0. This fits examples1 and2. Example0 is an exception, but perhaps there's a mistake in the example or I'm missing something.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that the output is generated by replacing the value that appears in the first row, first position with the other value, and the other value with0.\n\nFor example0's first row first element is4. So replace4 with0 and5 with4.\n\nExample1's first row first element is5. Replace5 with0 and6 with5. But example1's output has5 replaced with6, which contradicts.\n\nAlternatively, the first element of the input is considered the \"base\" value, and all other elements are replaced with0 unless they are the base value. But this doesn't fit.\n\nGiven that I'm stuck, perhaps I should proceed with the pattern from examples1 and2, which is replacing the smaller value with the larger and larger with0, and assume that example0 has a different pattern or is a typo.\n\nBut that's not safe. Alternatively, perhaps there's a different approach.\n\nLet's think about the test input. It's a 5x5 grid with two values:3 and5. The output should be based on the pattern.\n\nIf we apply the rule from examples1 and2:\n\n- Replace the smaller value (3) with the larger (5), and the larger (5) with0.\n\nBut that would mean replacing3s with5 and5s with0. So the output would have5s where input had3 and0 where input had5. But looking at the test input's5 positions:\n\nRow0:5 at index3.\n\nRow1:5 at index1.\n\nRow2:5 at indexes1,2,4.\n\nRow3:5 at index3.\n\nRow4:5 at indexes0,1,2.\n\nSo replacing those5s with0 and3s with5 would result in:\n\nRow0:5,5,5,0,5 \u2192 but that's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule is the opposite of examples1 and2. Replace larger with smaller and smaller with0.\n\nIn test input:\n\nLarger is5. Replace5 with3 (smaller), and3 with0.\n\nSo output would have:\n\nRow0:0,0,0,3,0.\n\nRow1:0,3,0,0,0.\n\nRow2:0,3,3,0,3.\n\nRow3:0,0,0,3,0.\n\nRow4:3,3,3,0,0.\n\nWhich matches the pattern where input5 becomes3 and3 becomes0.\n\nBut according to example1 and2's pattern, this is the opposite. So why the inconsistency?\n\nBut given that example0's output also follows this pattern (replace larger with smaller, smaller with0), perhaps this is the correct rule.\n\nExample0:\n\nInput has4 and5. Replace5 (larger) with4 (smaller), and4 (smaller) with0.\n\nExample1:\n\nInput5 and6. Replace6 (larger) with5 (smaller), and5 (smaller) with0.\n\nBut example1's output has5 replaced with6 and6 with0. So this is conflicting.\n\nThis is very confusing. Given the time I have, I'll proceed with the assumption that the pattern is to replace the larger value with0 and the smaller with the larger.\n\nBut this doesn't fit example0. But given that the test input has3 and5, which are smaller and larger respectively, according to example0's pattern, we would replace5 with3 and3 with0.\n\nSo the output would be:\n\nFor each cell:\n\nIf the input is5 \u21923.\n\nIf the input is3 \u21920.\n\nSo the test input's output would look like:\n\nRow0: [3,3,3,5,3] \u2192 [0,0,0,3,0]\n\nRow1: [3,5,3,3,3] \u2192 [0,3,0,0,0]\n\nRow2: [3,5,5,3,5] \u2192 [0,3,3,0,3]\n\nRow3: [3,3,3,5,3] \u2192 [0,0,0,3,0]\n\nRow4: [5,5,5,3,3] \u2192 [3,3,3,0,0]\n\nWhich matches the pattern seen in example0.\n\nBut this contradicts example1 and2. But how?\n\nAh! Maybe the pattern is to replace the larger value with the smaller and the smaller with0.\n\nExample0: 5\u21924,4\u21920.\n\nExample1:6\u21925,5\u21920.\n\nExample2:9\u21925,5\u21920. But example2's output has5\u21929 and9\u21920. So this doesn't fit.\n\nThis is very confusing. I think I've exhausted all options. The most consistent pattern across the examples is that the output replaces the smaller of the two values with the larger and the larger with0. This fits examples1 and2. Example0 is an exception. But perhaps there's a mistake in example0's description, or I'm missing something.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the pattern is to replace the maximum value with the minimum, and the minimum with0. This fits example0, but not examples1 and2.\n\nExample0:5\u21924,4\u21920.\n\nExample1:6\u21925,5\u21920. But example1's output is5\u21926,6\u21920.\n\nThis is conflicting.\n\nGiven the time I've spent, I think the correct answer is to apply the pattern from examples1 and2 to the test input.\n\nTest input's two values are3 and5. According to examples1 and2, replace3 (smaller) with5 (larger), and5 with0. But according to example0, it's the opposite.\n\nBut the test output should follow the pattern seen in examples1 and2.\n\nThus, the test output would have 3s replaced with5, and5s replaced with0. But the examples1 and2 show that the smaller value is replaced with the larger, and larger replaced with0.\n\nSo the test input's output should be:\n\nReplace3 with5,5 with0.\n\nBut in the test input:\n\nRow0:3,3,3,5,3 \u2192 becomes5,5,5,0,5 \u2192 but according to example1's output, which replaced5 with6 and6 with0, this would make the output row [5,5,5,0,5]. But the examples show a pattern where the non-zero elements form a specific structure. For example, example1's output has the non-zero elements in a diagonal pattern.\n\nBut the test input's5 positions are not forming a diagonal. So perhaps the output would be a grid where all3s become5 and5s become0, regardless of their positions. So the output would have:\n\n[5,5,5,0,5]\n\n[5,0,5,5,5]\n\n[5,0,0,5,0]\n\n[5,5,5,0,5]\n\n[0,0,0,5,5]\n\nBut this doesn't match the structure of the training examples. For example, example1's output has the non-zero elements arranged in a specific shifting pattern.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the pattern is to replace the smaller value with the larger and arrange the non-zero elements in a way that shifts right each row.\n\nBut the test input's3s are in most positions, so replacing them with5 would result in a mostly5s grid with some0s. This doesn't match the examples.\n\nAt this point, I'm really stuck. Given the time constraints, I'll proceed with the pattern from examples1 and2, even though example0 contradicts it. Thus, the test input's output should replace5s with0 and3s with5. So the output would have:\n\n[5,5,5,0,5]\n\n[5,0,5,5,5]\n\n[5,0,0,5,0]\n\n[5,5,5,0,5]\n\n[0,0,0,5,5]\n\nBut this doesn't look like the training examples. But looking at example1's input and output, the output's non-zero elements are in the positions where the input had the smaller value (5). So in example1's case, input5s become6s and6s become0.\n\nSo applying this to the test input: input3s are the smaller value, so replace them with5 (larger), and5s become0. So the output would have5s where the input had3s and0s where input had5s.\n\nThus, the output would be:\n\n[5,5,5,0,5]\n\n[5,0,5,5,5]\n\n[5,0,0,5,0]\n\n[5,5,5,0,5]\n\n[0,0,0,5,5]\n\nBut the training examples' outputs have a specific pattern. For example, example1's output is a diagonal band. So perhaps the test input's output would have the non-zero elements in a similar pattern, but based on the input's3s.\n\nBut the test input's3s are in most positions, except for the 5s. So the output would have5s almost everywhere, except where the input had5s. This doesn't form the diagonal pattern. So this must be incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the pattern is to replace the larger value with0 and the smaller with the larger.\n\nIn the test input's case, larger is5. So replace5 with0, and3 with5. So the output would be:\n\n[5,5,5,0,5]\n\n[5,0,5,5,5]\n\n[5,0,0,5,0]\n\n[5,5,5,0,5]\n\n[0,0,0,5,5]\n\nBut the output examples have a specific structure. For instance, example1's output forms a diagonal of non-zero elements. So the test input's output might be expected to form a similar structure.\n\nBut how?\n\nLooking back at the test input:\n\nRow0:3,3,3,5,3 \u2192 5 is at index3.\n\nRow1:3,5,3,3,3 \u21925 at index1.\n\nRow2:3,5,5,3,5 \u21925s at1,2,4.\n\nRow3:3,3,3,5,3 \u21925 at3.\n\nRow4:5,5,5,3,3 \u21925s at0,1,2.\n\nReplacing5s with0 and3s with5:\n\nThe output would have5s in all positions except where the input had5s, which become0.\n\nSo the output would be:\n\nRow0:5,5,5,0,5\n\nRow1:5,0,5,5,5\n\nRow2:5,0,0,5,0\n\nRow3:5,5,5,0,5\n\nRow4:0,0,0,5,5\n\nBut the training examples' outputs have a specific pattern, like diagonal bands. However, this output doesn't form such a pattern, which makes me think that perhaps the pattern is different.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the pattern is that the output's non-zero elements are the same as the positions where the input had the maximum value, replaced with the minimum value.\n\nIn test input:\n\nMax is5, min is3. So output would have5s replaced with3 and3s replaced with0.\n\nSo output would be:\n\nRow0:0,0,0,3,0\n\nRow1:0,3,0,0,0\n\nRow2:0,3,3,0,3\n\nRow3:0,0,0,3,0\n\nRow4:3,3,3,0,0]\n\nWhich matches the pattern seen in example0.\n\nBut example1 and2's outputs contradict this.\n\nBut given that example0's pattern fits this and the test input's output would follow example0's pattern, this might be the correct answer.\n\nSo based on example0's pattern, the test output would replace the max (5) with min (3), and min (3) with0.\n\nThus, the output is:\n\n[0,0,0,3,0]\n\n[0,3,0,0,0]\n\n[0,3,3,0,3]\n\n[0,0,0,3,0]\n\n[3,3,3,0,0]\n\nThis matches the pattern of example0 and also creates a structure where the non-zero elements are in the positions of the original max values, forming a certain pattern.\n\nIn example0, the output's non-zero elements form a cross where the input had max values. In the test input, the max values (5s) form a certain pattern, which when replaced with3, would create a similar pattern.\n\nSo the final answer should be this structure.",

        "cot_2": "Okay, let's see. I need to figure out the pattern here. The training examples show some input matrices and their corresponding outputs. Let me look at each example carefully.\n\nStarting with Example 0. The input is a 3x3 matrix:\n\n[4, 5, 4]\n[5, 5, 5]\n[4, 5, 4]\n\nThe output is:\n\n[0, 4, 0]\n[4, 4, 4]\n[0, 4, 0]\n\nHmm. So looking at the first row of input: 4,5,4. Output is 0,4,0. So maybe the 5s are being replaced? Wait, but the output has 4s where the input had 5s in the middle. Wait, no. Let me check each element.\n\nWait in the input matrix, the center is 5, and all the surrounding elements are 4 and 5. The output seems to have 4s in the middle row and column, and 0s elsewhere. Wait, maybe it's the minimum value. Let's see. The input has 4 and 5. The minimum is 4. So the output replaces the 5s with 4s and 4s with 0s? Or maybe the other way around. Wait, in the output, the 0s are in the positions where the original input had 4s. Wait, original input's first row is [4,5,4], output is [0,4,0]. So the 4s in the input became 0s, and the 5 became 4. Wait, but how does that make sense?\n\nWait maybe the transformation is that each element is replaced by the value of the element minus some value, but perhaps only if it's part of a certain structure. Alternatively, maybe it's about surrounding elements. Let's check another example.\n\nExample 1's input is a 5x5 matrix:\n\nInput:\n5,5,6,6,6\n6,5,5,6,6\n6,6,5,5,6\n6,6,6,5,5\n5,6,6,6,5\n\nOutput:\n6,6,0,0,0\n0,6,6,0,0\n0,0,6,6,0\n0,0,0,6,6\n6,0,0,0,6\n\nLooking at this, the output has 6s arranged in a diagonal pattern. For example, the first row starts with two 6s and then zeros. The second row starts with a 0, then two 6s, then zeros, etc. The last row has a 6 at the start and end. So maybe the output is creating a pattern where certain positions are kept as a specific value, others are zero. But how does that relate to the input?\n\nLooking at the input's first row: 5,5,6,6,6. The output is 6,6,0,0,0. So the 5s and 6s in input become 6s and zeros. Wait, perhaps the output is replacing elements that are part of a \"loop\" or some structure. Maybe the pattern is that in the input matrix, the output shows the highest value in the input, but only in certain positions. Let's check: in example 0, the input's highest value is 5. The output uses 4 and 0. Wait, that contradicts. So maybe not.\n\nWait in example 0, the input's elements are 4 and 5. The output replaces 5s with 4s and 4s with 0. So 5 becomes 4 (which is 5-1?), and 4 becomes 0. But why?\n\nLooking at example 1's input: the numbers are 5,6. The output has 6 and 0. So maybe in example 1, the 5s are being replaced by 6s and the 6s are being replaced by 0s? Let's check. The first input row is 5,5,6,6,6. The output is 6,6,0,0,0. So yes, the 5s became 6s, and the 6s became 0s. Then in example 0, the 5s became 4s and the 4s became 0s. So maybe the transformation is: for each element, if the element is equal to the minimum value in the matrix, replace it with the next higher value, otherwise replace it with 0. Wait let's see:\n\nIn example 0, the input matrix has values 4 and 5. The minimum is 4. So replacing 4 with the next higher value (5) but wait, but in the output, the 5s in the input became 4s, and the 4s became 0s. That doesn't fit. Alternatively, maybe the other way around: elements equal to the maximum are replaced by the second highest, and others are set to 0.\n\nIn example 0: input has 4 and 5. Max is 5. Second highest is 4. So maybe elements that are 5 (max) are replaced with 4 (second max), and others (4s) are set to 0. Let's check:\n\nOriginal input rows for example 0:\n\n[4,5,4] \u2192 [0,4,0] \u2192 yes, 5 becomes 4, 4s become 0.\n\nIn example 1: input values are 5 and 6. Max is 6, second is 5. So replacing 6s with 5s and others (5s) to 0. But in the output, the 5s in input are replaced by 6s, and 6s become 0. Wait, that's the opposite. Hmm. So maybe the pattern is that each element is replaced by the next higher value in the matrix, and if it's the maximum, replaced by 0. Wait that might not hold. Let's think again.\n\nWait in example 1's output, the elements that are 6 in output were 5 in input. For example, first row input is 5,5,6,6,6. Output is 6,6,0,0,0. So the 5s became 6s, and 6s became 0. So perhaps, each element is replaced by the next higher value in the matrix. Since the matrix's elements are 5 and 6. The next higher after 5 is 6, and after 6 there is nothing, so 0. That's possible. Then in example 0, the elements are 4 and 5. So 4's next higher is 5, 5's next higher would be nothing \u2192 0. Wait, but in example 0's output, the 5s are replaced by 4. So that contradicts.\n\nWait, this approach isn't working. Let's look for another pattern.\n\nAnother approach: look at the positions where the non-zero elements are in the output. In example 0, the output has a cross shape. The center of the 3x3 matrix is 4, and the middle row and column are all 4s. The input's middle row is all 5s, which in output became 4s, and the surrounding 4s became 0s.\n\nIn example 1's output, the non-zero elements form a diagonal band. Like, the first row starts with two 6s, then the next row has two 6s shifted right, etc. So perhaps the output is taking a certain value and creating a pattern where that value is placed in a specific structure, and the rest are zeros.\n\nWait, maybe the pattern is that each element in the output is the maximum value of its adjacent elements (including itself?) in the input, but only if it's part of a certain direction. Alternatively, perhaps it's a shift.\n\nLooking at example 1's input and output: the output's first row is [6,6,0,0,0]. The input's first row has [5,5,6,6,6]. So the first two elements (5,5) become 6,6, and the next three (6,6,6) become 0s. Hmm. That's the opposite. So maybe it's something like, in the input, if the element is part of a certain group (like the minimal elements), then it's replaced by the next higher value, and the higher values are replaced by 0.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is highlighting the positions where the element is equal to the minimum value in its row. But in example 0's first row, the min is 4, but in output, the 4s are replaced by 0. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is creating a kind of \"border\" or \"band\" where the elements in the input that are part of a certain structure (like a loop) are replaced by a certain value, others by 0.\n\nWait, in example 1's input, the 5s are arranged in a cross-like pattern. Let me check:\n\nThe input rows:\n\n5,5,6,6,6\n\n6,5,5,6,6\n\n6,6,5,5,6\n\n6,6,6,5,5\n\n5,6,6,6,5\n\nLooking at this, the 5s form a diagonal line from the top-left to bottom-right, but expanding. The output's non-zero elements are a diagonal of 6s. So maybe the output is taking the minimal elements (since 5 is lower than 6) and replacing them with the next higher value (6), and turning the original higher elements (6) into 0. So, for each element, if the element is the minimum in the matrix, replace it with the next higher value (which is 6 here), else set to 0. Let's test this.\n\nIn example 0: the input has 4 and 5. The minimum is 4. So elements equal to 4 (the min) are replaced by 5 (next higher), and others (5) are replaced by 0. But wait the output in example 0 has 4s where the input had 5s, and 0s where input had 4s. That's the opposite. So that doesn't fit.\n\nWait, maybe it's the reverse: elements that are the maximum in the matrix are replaced by the next lower value, and others are set to 0.\n\nIn example 0: input max is 5. So replace 5s with 4 (next lower), and others (4) to 0. That matches the output.\n\nIn example 1: input has max 6. Replace 6s with 5 (next lower), and others (5s) to 0. But the output in example 1 has 6s where input had 5s. So that's not matching. So that approach isn't correct.\n\nHmm. Let's think again. Another observation: in the output matrices, the non-zero elements are arranged in a way that forms a kind of ring or diagonal pattern, perhaps related to their positions. Maybe the transformation is that for each element in the input, if it's part of a certain diagonal or ring structure, replace it with a value, else 0.\n\nWait in example 1's output, the non-zero elements form a diagonal band that moves across the matrix. It looks like a spiral or some kind of shifted diagonal.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is a rotated version of the input's minimal path. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is based on the cell's position. For example, in example 0's output, the middle row and column are filled with 4s, which is the second highest value. So perhaps the transformation is that for cells in the middle row and column, replace with the second highest value, others 0. But in example 1, the output's pattern is different.\n\nAnother approach: look at the number of occurrences. For example 0: input has 4 and 5. Output uses 4 and 0. So maybe the output is replacing the maximum value with the second maximum, and the rest with 0. Wait in example 0, the max is 5. So replace 5s with 4 (second max) and 4s with 0. Which matches the output.\n\nIn example 1: max is 6, second max is 5. So replace 6s with 5, and 5s with 0. But the output has 6s and 0s. So that's not matching. So this approach fails.\n\nWait example 1's output has 6s where input had 5s, and 0s where input had 6s. So maybe the output is replacing the second max value with the max, and the max with 0. Let's see.\n\nIn example 0: input values are 4 (second max) and 5 (max). So replace 4 with 0 and 5 with 4. But example 0's output has 5s replaced by 4 and 4s replaced by 0. So that would fit. Then in example 1, the input has 5 (second max) and 6 (max). So replace 5s with 6 and 6s with 0. Which matches the output of example 1.\n\nWait that seems to fit. Let's check:\n\nExample 0:\n\nInput has elements 4 and 5. Max is 5, second max is 4. So any element equal to max (5) is replaced by second max (4), and any element equal to second max (4) is replaced by 0. Which gives the output.\n\nExample 1:\n\nInput has 5 and 6. Max is 6, second max is 5. So elements equal to 5 (second max) are replaced by 6 (max), and elements equal to 6 (max) are replaced by 0. That's exactly what the output shows. For example, in the first input row, 5,5,6,6,6. These are replaced by 6,6,0,0,0.\n\nSimilarly, example 2:\n\nInput values are 5 and 9. Max is 9, second max is 5. So elements equal to 5 (second max) are replaced by 9, and elements equal to 9 (max) are replaced by 0. Let's check the output of example 2:\n\nInput row 0: [9,5,9,9,9]. Output is [0,9,0,0,0]. So the 9s (max) become 0, 5 (second max) becomes 9. Which matches.\n\nYes, this seems to be the pattern. So the rule is: for each element in the input matrix, if the element is equal to the second maximum value in the entire matrix, replace it with the maximum value. If the element is equal to the maximum value, replace it with 0. All other elements (if there are more than two distinct values) would be replaced with 0? Wait in the examples provided, all elements are either the max or the second max. But what if there are more values?\n\nBut in the training examples, all elements are either the max or the second max. Let's verify:\n\nExample 2's input has 9 and 5, so same pattern. So the rule is:\n\n1. Find the maximum value in the input matrix.\n2. Find the second maximum value (the next highest value after max).\n3. Replace each occurrence of the second maximum with the maximum.\n4. Replace each occurrence of the maximum with 0.\n5. All other values (if any) are set to 0.\n\nBut in the examples, all elements are either max or second max, so no others. So applying this to the test input.\n\nNow let's process the test input:\n\nTest Input:\n\n[3, 3, 3, 5, 3]\n[3, 5, 3, 3, 3]\n[3, 5, 5, 3, 5]\n[3, 3, 3, 5, 3]\n[5, 5, 5, 3, 3]\n\nFirst, find the max and second max. Looking at all elements:\n\nValues are 3 and 5. So max is 5, second max is 3.\n\nSo according to the pattern:\n\n- Replace all 3s (second max) with 5 (max) \u2192 but wait, no. Wait according to the previous examples, the second max is replaced by the max. But in the earlier examples:\n\nIn example 0, the second max is 4 (since max is 5). So elements equal to 4 (second max) are replaced by 5 (max). But wait, in example 0's output, the 5s in input are replaced by 4. Wait this is conflicting.\n\nWait wait, wait. Let me re-express the pattern:\n\nIn the examples:\n\nExample 0:\n\nInput elements are 4 and 5. Max is 5, second max is 4.\n\nOutput:\n\nReplace 5 (max) with 4 (second max), and 4 (second max) with 0.\n\nWait that contradicts the previous conclusion. Because in example 0's output, the 5s are replaced with 4s, and 4s with 0. So according to that, the rule is:\n\n- Replace max with second max.\n\n- Replace second max with 0.\n\nBut then in example 1:\n\nMax is 6, second max is 5.\n\nIn output, 5s are replaced with 6, and 6s with 0. Which aligns with:\n\nReplace second max (5) with max (6), and max (6) with 0.\n\nWait this is conflicting. How can this be?\n\nWait example 0's input:\n\nmax is 5, second max is 4.\n\nOutput: 5 \u2192 4, 4 \u2192 0.\n\nExample 1's input:\n\nmax is 6, second max is 5.\n\nOutput: 5 \u2192 6, 6 \u21920.\n\nAh, so the pattern is:\n\n- For each element:\n\n   If the element is the second max, replace it with the max.\n\n   If the element is the max, replace it with 0.\n\nSo in example 0, 5 (max) becomes 0, but wait no. Wait in example 0's input, the output has elements that were 5 in input becoming 4 (which is the second max). But according to the previous approach, if the element is the max (5), replace with 0. But in example 0, the 5s are replaced with 4 (the second max). So this contradicts.\n\nWait this is confusing. Let me re-express the examples:\n\nIn example 0:\n\nInput: 4 and 5. Output: 5s become 4, 4s become 0. So for each element:\n\nif element is max (5), replace with second max (4).\n\nif element is second max (4), replace with 0.\n\nIn example 1:\n\nInput:5 and6. Output:5 becomes6,6 becomes0. So same pattern.\n\nSo the rule is:\n\n1. Find the max value in the matrix.\n\n2. Find the second highest value (second max) in the matrix.\n\n3. For each element:\n\n   - if it's equal to the max \u2192 replace with 0.\n\n   - if it's equal to the second max \u2192 replace with the max.\n\n   - any other values (if present) \u2192 replace with 0.\n\nIn example 0:\n\nmax is5, second max is4.\n\nSo 5 \u21920, 4 \u21925, but wait no, because in example 0's output, 5s in input become4. So that's not the case.\n\nWait this is not adding up. Let me check again.\n\nExample 0 input:\n\nOriginal matrix:\n\n[4,5,4]\n\n[5,5,5]\n\n[4,5,4]\n\nOutput:\n\n[0,4,0]\n\n[4,4,4]\n\n[0,4,0]\n\nSo in the input, the 5s are replaced with4 and 4s replaced with0. So the replacement is:\n\n5 \u21924 (second max)\n\n4 \u21920.\n\nBut according to that, the max (5) is replaced with the second max (4), and the second max is replaced with 0.\n\nSo the rule is: max becomes second max, and second max becomes 0.\n\nIn example 1:\n\nInput has 5 and6. So max is6, second max is5.\n\nOutput:5 \u21926, 6\u21920.\n\nSo yes, same pattern.\n\nSo the rule is:\n\nFor each element:\n\n- If it's the maximum value in the entire matrix, replace it with 0.\n\n- If it's the second maximum value, replace it with the maximum value.\n\n- All other values (if any) are replaced with 0.\n\nSo in example 0:\n\nmax is5, second max is4. So 5 \u21920, 4 \u21925. But in the output of example0, the 5s are replaced with4. Wait, no. Wait this is conflicting.\n\nWait example 0's output is [0,4,0], etc. So where input was5, output is4, but according to this rule, the second max is4. So replacing the second max (4) with max (5), and max (5) with 0. So how does that fit?\n\nWait no, the example0's output has 4 where input was5. So according to the current rule, the input's max (5) is replaced with 0, but that's not the case. So there's a mistake here.\n\nHmm, perhaps I have to reverse the approach. What if:\n\nThe replacement is such that:\n\n- The second max is replaced with the max.\n\n- The max is replaced with 0.\n\nBut in example 0, the input's second max is4. So replacing 4 with5 (max), and 5 with0.\n\nBut in example0's output, the 5s are replaced with4, which is the second max. That doesn't fit. So this is confusing.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule is:\n\nThe output matrix is formed by replacing each occurrence of the second highest value with the highest value, and the highest value with 0. But that's what I thought earlier.\n\nExample0:\n\nInput has highest 5, second 4. So replace 4 \u21925, 5 \u21920. But in example0's output, the input 5s are replaced with4. So that's not matching. So this is not the case.\n\nWait this is getting really confusing. Let's try to re-express the examples:\n\nIn example0:\n\nInput elements are 4 and5. Output elements are0 and4.\n\nSo input 4 \u21920, input5 \u21924.\n\nSo the replacement is: subtract 1 from each element. But 4\u21920 (4-4=0?), 5\u21924 (5-1=4). That could fit. But let's check other examples.\n\nExample1:\n\nInput elements are5 and6. Output elements are6 and0.\n\n5 \u21926, 6 \u21920. So 5+1=6, 6-6=0. Hmm, but the operations are not consistent.\n\nExample2:\n\nInput elements are5 and9. Output elements are0 and9.\n\nInput5 \u21929 (5+4?), 9\u21920. So again, no consistent pattern.\n\nSo that approach doesn't work.\n\nAlternative idea: perhaps the output is a kind of \"distance\" from the center or edges. For example, in example0's output, the center cross is filled with4, which might relate to the input's structure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's a rotation. For example, the output is the input rotated 90 degrees, but with some transformation. But the numbers don't match. In example0, the input's middle row is 5,5,5, which becomes4,4,4. So rotation is not likely.\n\nAlternatively, consider that in each example, the output is a diamond or cross shape. Maybe the pattern is that the output is the second max value arranged in a certain pattern, while the max is zeroed out.\n\nAlternatively, think about the number of times a value appears. In example0, input has more 5s than 4s. Output has 4s where the input had 5s, and 0s where input had 4s. So maybe the less frequent value is promoted, and the more frequent is zeroed. But example1 has input with more 6s than 5s. Output promotes 5s to 6s and zeros 6s. So that would fit, because 5s are less frequent.\n\nWait in example0, 5 appears more times than4. For example, in the input matrix, there are 5 5s and 4 4s (wait not sure of the exact count). Let me count:\n\nExample0 input:\n\nRow 0:4,5,4 \u2192 two 4s, one5.\n\nRow1:5,5,5 \u2192 three 5s.\n\nRow2:4,5,4 \u2192 two4s, one5.\n\nTotal 4s: 4+2= 4 (rows 0 and 2 have 2 each?), wait row0 has two4s, row2 two4s, total 4. 5s: 1+3+1=5. So 5s are more frequent. Output promotes the less frequent value (4s) to max. So 5s become4s, and4s become0. But in example1, 5s are less frequent than6s. So 5s are promoted to6, and6s become0. So maybe the pattern is:\n\nReplace the less frequent value with the more frequent value, and the more frequent value with 0.\n\nIn example0, 4 is less frequent (4 times) than5 (5 times). So replace4 (less frequent) with5, and5 (more frequent) with0. But in the output, the 4s are replaced with0 and5s with4. So that's the opposite. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, the more frequent value is replaced with the less frequent value, and the less frequent is replaced with0. No.\n\nHmm. This is tricky.\n\nLet me try to think of it differently. Let's look at each example's output and see if there's a relation between the input and output's non-zero elements' positions.\n\nIn example0's output, the non-zero elements form a cross (middle row and column). The input's middle row was all 5s, and middle column is also 5s. So the output's cross is where the input had 5s. But the output replaces those 5s with4s and the 4s in input with0.\n\nIn example1's output, the non-zero elements form a diagonal band. The input's 5s form a diagonal line. So the output's non-zero elements are in the positions where the input had 5s, replaced with6s, and 6s replaced with0.\n\nIn example2's output, the non-zero elements are where the input had5s, which are replaced with9s, and9s in input are replaced with0.\n\nSo it seems that the output's non-zero positions correspond to the positions of the second highest value in the input matrix, and the highest value in the input matrix's positions are set to0.\n\nSo, the pattern is:\n\n- The second highest value in the input matrix is replaced by the highest value.\n\n- The highest value is replaced by 0.\n\nThus, in example0, the second highest value is4. So wherever there is4 in the input, it's replaced with5 (the highest), but according to example0's output, the 4s in input are replaced with0. Wait, no. Example0's output has 4s where the input had5s. So that's not matching. So this approach is incorrect.\n\nWait in example0, input has highest5 and second4. So the output is replacing5s with4 and4s with0. So the highest is replaced with second, and the second is replaced with0.\n\nSo the rule is:\n\nFor each element in the input:\n\n- if it's the highest value, replace it with the second highest.\n\n- if it's the second highest, replace it with0.\n\n- all other values (if any) are replaced with0.\n\nThis seems to fit.\n\nLet's verify:\n\nExample0: highest5, second4.\n\nInput elements5 \u21924, 4\u21920. Output is as shown.\n\nExample1: highest6, second5.\n\nInput elements6\u21920, 5\u21926. Output shows 5s replaced by6, 6s replaced by0.\n\nExample2: highest9, second5.\n\nInput elements9\u21920,5\u21929. Output has5s replaced by9, 9s replaced by0.\n\nYes, this fits all examples.\n\nSo the pattern is:\n\nFor each element:\n\n- if it's the maximum value in the entire input matrix, replace it with 0.\n\n- if it's the second maximum value, replace it with the maximum value.\n\n- any other values (if present) are replaced with 0.\n\nNow, applying this to the test input:\n\nTest Input:\n\n[3, 3, 3, 5, 3]\n\n[3, 5, 3, 3, 3]\n\n[3, 5, 5, 3, 5]\n\n[3, 3, 3, 5, 3]\n\n[5, 5, 5, 3, 3]\n\nFirst, determine the maximum and second maximum values.\n\nLooking at all elements:\n\nValues present are3 and5.\n\nSo maximum is5, second maximum is3.\n\nSo according to the pattern:\n\n- Replace all5s (max) with0.\n\n- Replace all3s (second max) with5.\n\n- Any other values (none here) become0.\n\nSo each3 becomes5, and each5 becomes0.\n\nLet's apply this to each element of the test input.\n\nOriginal rows:\n\nRow0: [3,3,3,5,3] \u2192 Replace3\u21925,5\u21920 \u2192 [5,5,5,0,5]\n\nRow1: [3,5,3,3,3] \u2192 [5,0,5,5,5]\n\nRow2: [3,5,5,3,5] \u2192 [5,0,0,5,0]\n\nWait no. Wait row2's elements are3,5,5,3,5. Replacing 5s with0 and3s with5. So row2 becomes [5,0,0,5,0].\n\nRow3: [3,3,3,5,3] \u2192 [5,5,5,0,5]\n\nRow4: [5,5,5,3,3] \u2192 [0,0,0,5,5]\n\nBut looking at the training examples' outputs, they have the same structure as the input but with replaced values. However, the test input's output according to this pattern would be:\n\n[5,5,5,0,5]\n\n[5,0,5,5,5]\n\n[5,0,0,5,0]\n\n[5,5,5,0,5]\n\n[0,0,0,5,5]\n\nBut let's compare this to the training examples.\n\nWait example1's output was for a 5x5 matrix where the 5s were replaced by6 and6s by0, resulting in a diagonal pattern. So in that case, the output's structure was a band of6s where the input had5s, and 0s where input had6s.\n\nApplying the same logic to the test input, each3 becomes5, and5 becomes0. So the output should have5s wherever there were3s, and0s wherever there were5s.\n\nBut let's see:\n\nTest input's first row: [3,3,3,5,3] becomes [5,5,5,0,5]\n\nSecond row: [3,5,3,3,3] becomes [5,0,5,5,5]\n\nThird row: [3,5,5,3,5] \u2192 [5,0,0,5,0]\n\nFourth row: [3,3,3,5,3] \u2192 [5,5,5,0,5]\n\nFifth row: [5,5,5,3,3] \u2192 [0,0,0,5,5]\n\nBut looking at the training examples, the output maintains certain patterns. For example, example1's output has a diagonal pattern where the non-zero elements are shifted. But according to this rule, the test input's output would have 5s in the positions where the input had3s, which is a lot of 5s. But the sample outputs in the training examples don't have all the non-zero elements filled; they have specific patterns. Wait, but according to the rule we derived, that's exactly what would happen. But in the test input, the output may look like:\n\n[5,5,5,0,5]\n\n[5,0,5,5,5]\n\n[5,0,0,5,0]\n\n[5,5,5,0,5]\n\n[0,0,0,5,5]\n\nBut the training examples' outputs have non-zero elements arranged in certain patterns. For example, example1's output has a diagonal band of non-zero elements, which corresponds to the positions where the input's second max (5) was present. So perhaps in the test case, the output is the same as the one generated by the rule above.\n\nBut I need to check whether this matches the expected pattern.\n\nBut wait, looking at the test input's output as per the rule:\n\nRow0: 5,5,5,0,5\n\nRow1:5,0,5,5,5\n\nRow2:5,0,0,5,0\n\nRow3:5,5,5,0,5\n\nRow4:0,0,0,5,5\n\nBut looking back at the training examples, the outputs have non-zero elements in certain structures, not just everywhere. However, according to the rule derived, it's simply a matter of replacing 3 with5 and5 with0, which would result in the above output. \n\nBut wait example2's output has:\n\nInput row0: [9,5,9,9,9] \u2192 becomes [0,9,0,0,0]\n\nWhich fits the rule: replace9\u21920,5\u21929.\n\nSo according to that, the test input's output should be as derived.\n\nBut perhaps there's another layer to the pattern. For example, maybe the non-zero elements in the output are only those where the original element was the second max and had a certain number of adjacent max elements. But that complicates things and isn't supported by the training examples.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a mistake in the pattern identification. Let me recheck.\n\nExample0:\n\nInput:\n\n4,5,4\n\n5,5,5\n\n4,5,4\n\nOutput:\n\n0,4,0\n\n4,4,4\n\n0,4,0\n\nSo according to the rule:\n\nReplace max (5) with 0, second max (4) with5.\n\nWait no, because the output has4s where input had5s, and0 where input had4s. So the output is:\n\n5\u21924\n\n4\u21920\n\nWhich contradicts the earlier rule. So this indicates that the pattern is different.\n\nThis is confusing. Let me reevaluate.\n\nAnother approach: let's consider that in each example, the output is formed by replacing the highest value with the second highest, and the second highest with zero.\n\nSo in example0:\n\nmax=5, second=4. So 5\u21924,4\u21920.\n\nWhich matches the output.\n\nExample1:\n\nmax=6, second=5. So6\u21925,5\u21920. But example1's output is:\n\n[6,6,0,0,0]\n\n[0,6,6,0,0]\n\n[0,0,6,6,0]\n\n[0,0,0,6,6]\n\n[6,0,0,0,6]\n\nWhich would mean that input's5s became6 and6s became0. So that's not matching.\n\nWait this doesn't fit. So this approach is incorrect.\n\nSo the previous conclusion that the pattern is replacing the second max with the max and max with 0 seems to work for examples1 and2 but not example0.\n\nExample0's input: max5, second4. Output replaces5 with4, and4 with0. So the rule here is: max is replaced with second, second is replaced with0.\n\nSo for example0:5\u21924,4\u21920.\n\nExample1: max6, second5. Output replaces5\u21926,6\u21920. So rule: second\u2192max, max\u21920.\n\nSo how can these two examples follow the same rule? Because in example0, it's max\u2192second, and in example1, second\u2192max. This seems contradictory.\n\nSo this suggests that the pattern is not uniform across examples. Which is impossible, so there must be a different pattern.\n\nAlternative idea: Perhaps the output is the input matrix rotated by 180 degrees, with certain value replacements. But checking example0's input and output:\n\nInput:\n\nRow0:4,5,4\n\nRow1:5,5,5\n\nRow2:4,5,4\n\nOutput:\n\nRow0:0,4,0\n\nRow1:4,4,4\n\nRow2:0,4,0\n\nIf we rotate the input 180 degrees, it would be the same (since it's symmetric). So rotation isn't the case.\n\nAnother idea: maybe the output is a convolution where each cell is the sum of its neighbors, but modulo some value. But it's unclear.\n\nAlternatively, think about the positions where the max and second max are located.\n\nIn example0's input, the max (5) is in the middle row and column. Output has 4s (second max) in those positions and0s elsewhere.\n\nIn example1's input, the second max (5) is in a diagonal pattern, which becomes max (6) in the output. So the output's non-zero elements are in the positions where the second max was located, replaced with max.\n\nAh! This seems to be the key.\n\nSo the pattern is:\n\n- For each element in the input:\n\n   If the element is the second maximum value in the entire matrix, replace it with the maximum value.\n\n   Else, replace it with0.\n\nThis way, in example0:\n\nThe second max is4. All 4s in input are replaced with0, and 5s are replaced with0. Wait no. Because in example0's output, the 4s are present where the input had5s.\n\nWait this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, the output is the second max value placed where the max values were, and max values replaced with0.\n\nWait example0's input has max5 in certain positions. The output has4s in those positions. So 5\u21924, and 4\u21920.\n\nExample1's input has max6. The output has6s in the positions where the input had5s (second max). So 5\u21926, and6\u21920.\n\nExample2's input has max9. The output has9s where the input had5s (second max), and 9s are replaced with0.\n\nSo the pattern is:\n\n- For each element in the input:\n\n   If it's the second maximum value, replace it with the maximum value.\n\n   If it's the maximum value, replace it with0.\n\n   All other values (if any) are replaced with0.\n\nYes, this fits all examples.\n\nSo the rule is:\n\n1. Find the maximum value (max_val) and the second maximum value (second_max_val) in the input matrix.\n\n2. For each element in the input:\n\n   a. If the element is equal to second_max_val \u2192 replace with max_val.\n\n   b. Else if the element is equal to max_val \u2192 replace with 0.\n\n   c. Else \u2192 replace with 0.\n\nThis fits all examples.\n\nExample0:\n\nInput has max5, second4. So:\n\n5\u21920, 4\u21925. But example0's output has4s where 5s were. So this doesn't fit. Wait why?\n\nWait no, example0's output has4s where input had5s, and0s where input had4s.\n\nWait this contradicts the rule.\n\nWait example0's input has 4 as the second max, so according to the rule, input4 should be replaced with5, and input5 replaced with0.\n\nBut the output has4s where input had5s, and0s where input had4s. So this is the opposite.\n\nAh! So I think I have the rule reversed.\n\nLet me re-express:\n\nThe rule is:\n\nReplace the max_val with 0.\n\nReplace the second_max_val with max_val.\n\nOther values \u21920.\n\nWait example0's input: 5 is max,4 is second.\n\nSo 5\u21920,4\u21925.\n\nBut in example0's output, the input's5s are replaced with4, not0. So this doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. This is really confusing.\n\nWait perhaps the rule is:\n\nReplace the second_max_val with0.\n\nReplace the max_val with second_max_val.\n\nOther values \u21920.\n\nExample0: 5\u21924,4\u21920.\n\nWhich matches example0's output.\n\nExample1:5\u21920,6\u21925. But example1's output has5s replaced with6 and6s with0. So no.\n\nThis is getting too frustrating. Let's think of another approach.\n\nLet me look at example0:\n\nInput:5 is the max. The output replaces5s with4 and4s with0. 4 is the second max.\n\nSo the rule here is:\n\nmax_val (5) \u2192 second_max_val (4)\n\nsecond_max_val (4) \u21920\n\nExample1:\n\nmax_val (6) \u21920\n\nsecond_max_val (5) \u21926\n\nWhich matches example1's output.\n\nExample2:\n\nmax_val (9) \u21920\n\nsecond_max_val (5) \u21929\n\nYes.\n\nSo the pattern is:\n\n- Replace max_val with second_max_val.\n\n- Replace second_max_val with0.\n\n- All other values \u21920.\n\nSo for each element:\n\nif element == max_val \u2192 replace with second_max_val\n\nelif element == second_max_val \u2192 replace with0\n\nelse \u21920\n\nLet's verify:\n\nExample0:\n\nmax=5, second=4.\n\nInput5\u21924, input4\u21920.\n\nOutput matrix's non-zero elements are4s where input had5s, and0s where input had4s. Which matches.\n\nExample1:\n\nmax=6, second=5.\n\nInput6\u21920, input5\u21926.\n\nOutput matrix's non-zero elements are6s where input had5s, and0s where input had6s. Which matches.\n\nExample2:\n\nmax=9, second=5.\n\nInput9\u21925 \u2192 but according to example2's output, input9s are replaced with0. Wait no. Example2's output has9s where input had5s, and0s where input had9s. So this contradicts.\n\nWait in example2:\n\nInput row0:9,5,9,9,9 \u2192 output is0,9,0,0,0.\n\nSo input5\u21929, input9\u21920. So according to the rule, input5 (second_max) \u21920. But in example2, input5s are replaced with9 (max), and9s replaced with0.\n\nSo the rule would have to be:\n\nReplace second_max_val with max_val.\n\nReplace max_val with0.\n\nWhich is what I thought earlier.\n\nSo yes. So the correct rule is:\n\nFor each element:\n\nif element == max_val \u2192 replace with0.\n\nif element == second_max_val \u2192 replace with max_val.\n\nelse \u21920.\n\nSo example0:\n\nmax=5, second=4.\n\ninput5 \u21920.\n\ninput4 \u21925.\n\nThus, output has5s where input had4s and0s where input had5s. But example0's output has4s where input had5s and0s where input had4s. So this doesn't fit.\n\nSo this is the crux of the problem. Why is there a discrepancy here?\n\nWait in example0's output, the positions where input was5 are now4, and positions where input was4 are now0. But according to the rule, input5 should be replaced with0, and input4 replaced with5. Which doesn't match.\n\nThis suggests that the previous assumption is incorrect.\n\nLet me re-examine example0:\n\nInput:\n\n[4,5,4]\n\n[5,5,5]\n\n[4,5,4]\n\nOutput:\n\n[0,4,0]\n\n[4,4,4]\n\n[0,4,0]\n\nSo input5\u21924, input4\u21920.\n\nSo the rule here is:\n\nmax_val (5) \u2192 replaced with second_max_val (4)\n\nsecond_max_val (4) \u2192 replaced with0.\n\nWhich is the opposite of the previous rule.\n\nThus, the pattern is:\n\nFor each element:\n\nif element is max_val \u2192 replace with second_max_val.\n\nif element is second_max_val \u2192 replace with0.\n\n else \u21920.\n\nThis way:\n\nExample0:\n\nmax=5 \u21924.\n\nsecond=4\u21920.\n\nExample1:\n\nmax=6 \u21925.\n\nsecond=5\u21920.\n\nBut example1's output has input5s replaced with6, and6s replaced with0. So if the rule is:\n\nmax (6) \u2192 replaced with5.\n\nsecond (5) \u2192 replaced with0.\n\nBut example1's output has5\u21926, which would be replacing second_max with max. So this rule doesn't fit.\n\nThis is really puzzling. It seems there's a contradiction between the examples.\n\nBut perhaps there's a different approach. Let's look at the number of occurrences of each value.\n\nIn example0, the max_val (5) appears 5 times, second_max (4) appears 4 times.\n\nOutput: 4 appears 5 times, 0 appears 4 times. So the counts are swapped.\n\nExample1: max_val (6) appears 15 times (each row has 3 or more), second_max (5) appears 10 times. Output:6 appears 10 times,0 appears the rest. So counts are swapped.\n\nExample2: max_val (9) appears frequently, second_max (5) appears several times. Output:9 appears where 5s were, and0 elsewhere.\n\nSo the pattern is that the output swaps the counts of max and second_max. So for each occurrence of max_val, it becomes second_max_val, and second_max becomes max_val. But this isn't exactly the case.\n\nAlternatively, the output's non-zero elements are the same in number as the input's second_max elements, and their value is the max.\n\n example0's second_max count is4 (input 4s), output4s are5 (max) counts?\n\nNo. In example0's output, there are 5 4s. The input's max count was5 5s.\n\nSo perhaps the output's non-zero elements are the same count as the input's max count, but with the value of the second_max.\n\n example0: input5s (5 times) \u2192 output4s (5 times). Input4s (4 times) \u2192 output0s. So the output's non-zero elements' count equals the input's max count. The value of these is the second_max.\n\n example1: input5s (10 times) \u2192 output6s (10 times). Input6s (15 times) \u2192 output0s. So output's non-zero elements count equals input's second_max count. No, example1's output has 10 non-zero 6s. Input's second_max (5) count is10. So output's non-zero count is same as input's second_max count. So the rule is:\n\nThe output's non-zero elements are the same as the input's second_max elements in count and positions, but their value is the max_val. The input's max_val elements are replaced with0.\n\nYes! This fits all examples.\n\nExample0:\n\nInput's second_max (4) are in positions where the output has0. Wait no.\n\nWait no. For example0, the input's second_max is4. The output's non-zero elements are in positions where the input had5s (max), and their value is4.\n\nSo perhaps the output's non-zero elements are in the positions of the input's max_val elements, and their value is the second_max_val. All other elements are0.\n\nYes. This fits:\n\nExample0:\n\nInput's max (5) positions are replaced with second_max (4).\n\nOther elements (4s) are replaced with0.\n\nExample1:\n\nInput's max (6) positions are replaced with0.\n\nInput's second_max (5) positions are replaced with6.\n\nThus, in example1's output, the positions where input had5s (second_max) are now6s, and positions where input had6s are0.\n\nWhich matches.\n\nExample2:\n\nInput's max (9) positions are replaced with0.\n\nInput's second_max (5) positions are replaced with9.\n\nWhich matches the output.\n\nSo the pattern is:\n\n- For each element in the input:\n\n   If the element is the maximum value \u2192 replace it with0.\n\n   If the element is the second maximum value \u2192 replace it with the maximum value.\n\n   Else \u2192 replace with0.\n\nSo this is the correct pattern.\n\nNow, applying this to the test input:\n\nTest Input:\n\n[3, 3, 3, 5, 3]\n\n[3, 5, 3, 3, 3]\n\n[3, 5, 5, 3, 5]\n\n[3, 3, 3, 5, 3]\n\n[5, 5, 5, 3, 3]\n\nThe values are3 and5.\n\nMax_val is5.\n\nSecond_max_val is3.\n\nSo:\n\n- Replace all5s (max) with0.\n\n- Replace all3s (second_max) with5.\n\n- All other values (none here) are0.\n\nSo the test input becomes:\n\nRow0: [3,3,3,5,3] \u2192 each3\u21925,5\u21920 \u2192 [5,5,5,0,5]\n\nRow1: [3,5,3,3,3] \u2192 [5,0,5,5,5]\n\nRow2: [3,5,5,3,5] \u2192 [5,0,0,5,0]\n\nRow3: [3,3,3,5,3] \u2192 [5,5,5,0,5]\n\nRow4: [5,5,5,3,3] \u2192 [0,0,0,5,5]\n\nSo the output matrix should be:\n\n[5,5,5,0,5]\n\n[5,0,5,5,5]\n\n[5,0,0,5,0]\n\n[5,5,5,0,5]\n\n[0,0,0,5,5]\n\nBut comparing this to the training examples' outputs, for example1's output, the non-zero elements form a diagonal band. But in this case, the output would have 5s in many positions. However, according to the derived pattern, this is correct.\n\nBut looking at the training examples, the output formats have the same structure as the input but with replacements. So the test input's output should be as above.\n\nHowever, the training examples' outputs use the maximum value as the replacement for the second max. For example, example0's output uses4 (the second max) for the max positions, but according to this rule, it's the other way around.\n\nWait no, in example0, the second max is4. So the input's max positions (5s) are replaced with0, and the second max positions (4s) are replaced with5. But example0's output has4s where the input had5s, and0s where the input had4s. Which contradicts this rule.\n\nThis suggests that the pattern identification is still incorrect.\n\nAh! I think I see the mistake. In example0, the input's second_max is4. But according to the previous reasoning, the output's non-zero elements are the positions where the input had the second_max, replaced with max.\n\nBut in example0's output, the non-zero elements are where the input had the max (5), replaced with the second_max (4).\n\nThis is the opposite of the pattern observed in examples1 and2.\n\nThis inconsistency suggests that there's a different pattern.\n\nAlternatively, the pattern is:\n\n- Replace each occurrence of the second_max with max.\n\n- Replace each occurrence of the max with second_max.\n\nBut then:\n\nExample0:\n\n5\u21924,4\u21925.\n\nBut the output has4s where 5s were and0s where4s were. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, swap max and second_max, and set other values to0.\n\nBut that doesn't fit.\n\nThis is perplexing. Perhaps there's a different pattern that I'm missing.\n\nLet me look at example0's input and output again.\n\nInput matrix (example0):\n\nRow0:4,5,4 \u2192 output0,4,0\n\nRow1:5,5,5 \u2192 output4,4,4\n\nRow2:4,5,4 \u2192 output0,4,0\n\nSo the output has4s where the input had5s in the middle row and column. So the output is forming a cross shape where the input's max values were located.\n\nExample1's output is a diagonal band where the input's second_max values were located.\n\nExample2's output is various positions where the input's second_max were located.\n\nSo the pattern seems to be that the output's non-zero elements are located where the input's max values were, and their value is the second_max. But this doesn't fit example1.\n\nExample1's output has non-zero elements where the input's second_max (5) were located. For example, the first row of input has 5,5,6,6,6. Output is6,6,0,0,0. So the output's non-zero elements are where the input's second_max (5) were located. So in this case, the output's non-zero positions correspond to the input's second_max positions.\n\nSo, the pattern is:\n\n- For each element:\n\n   If it's the second_max \u2192 replaced with max.\n\n   Else \u2192 replaced with0.\n\nThis fits example1.\n\nIn example0:\n\nThe input's second_max is4. The output has4s where the input's max (5) were. So this doesn't fit. So this approach is incorrect.\n\nThis is very confusing. I think I need to re-express the pattern in a different way.\n\nLet's look for a common theme in the outputs of all examples:\n\n- The non-zero elements in the output form a pattern that is a \"shift\" of the input's second_max positions.\n\nFor example, in example1, the input's second_max (5) are arranged in a diagonal pattern. The output's non-zero elements (6) are in the same diagonal pattern.\n\nIn example2, the input's second_max (5) are in certain positions, and the output's non-zero elements (9) are in those positions.\n\nIn example0, the input's second_max (4) are in the outer positions, but the output's non-zero elements (4) are in the middle cross. So this doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. So example0 is the outlier here.\n\nAlternatively, the output's non-zero elements are in the same positions as the input's max elements. For example0, the output's non-zero elements are where the input had5s, and their value is4 (second_max).\n\nExample1's output's non-zero elements are where the input had5s (second_max), replaced with6 (max). So this doesn't fit.\n\nThis is really challenging. Let's try to think of it as a two-step process.\n\nStep1: Identify the value to use for non-zero elements. In all examples, the non-zero value is the second_max in the input.\n\nExample0: non-zero is4 (second_max).\n\nExample1: non-zero is6 (max?), no. example1's non-zero is6, which is the max of the input. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAh, so this approach is not working.\n\nGiven the time I've spent, I think the correct pattern is:\n\n- Replace the max value with 0.\n\n- Replace the second_max value with the max value.\n\n- All other values become0.\n\nThis fits examples1 and2 but not example0. But since the test input's max is5 and second_max is3, applying this rule would give the output where3\u21925 and5\u21920.\n\nThus, the test input's output would be:\n\n[5,5,5,0,5]\n\n[5,0,5,5,5]\n\n[5,0,0,5,0]\n\n[5,5,5,0,5]\n\n[0,0,0,5,5]\n\nBut example0's output doesn't fit this rule, which suggests that perhaps there's a different pattern. But given the time constraints, I'll proceed with this pattern and see."
