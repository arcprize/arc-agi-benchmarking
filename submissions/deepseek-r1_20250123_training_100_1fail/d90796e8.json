        "cot_1": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. So, looking at the training examples, I need to see how the input matrices are transformed into the output. Let's start with Example 0.\n\nIn Example 0, the input is:\n[3, 2, 0]\n[0, 0, 0]\n[0, 5, 0]\n\nAnd the output is:\n[8, 0, 0]\n[0, 0, 0]\n[0, 5, 0]\n\nHmm. So the first row's 3 and 2 became 8. 3+2 is 5, but 8 is 3+5? Wait, maybe there's something else. Oh, maybe the sum is multiplied by something. Wait, 3 + 2 = 5, but 8 is 5 plus 3? Not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's the sum of adjacent numbers. Let me check another example.\n\nLooking at Example 1. The input has several rows. For instance, the second row in the input is [0, 0, 3, 2, 0, 0], and the output becomes [0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0]. So here, 3 and 2 sum to 5, but the output is 8. Wait, 3 + 2 = 5, but 5 plus 3 (maybe their positions?) Not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's combining adjacent non-zero numbers. Let's see: 3 and 2 are adjacent, so maybe their sum is 5, but the output is 8. Wait, 3 + 2 = 5, but 5 plus 3 (the index maybe? Not sure). Alternatively, maybe the product plus something. 3 * 2 is 6. 6 + 2 = 8? Not sure. Wait, in Example 0, 3 and 2 sum to 5, but 8 is 3 * 2 + (3+2) = 6 +5=11, which is not 8. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the sum of the two numbers and then multiply by the number of elements summed. For 3 and 2: sum is 5, multiplied by 2 (since two numbers) gives 10, which isn't 8. So that's not it.\n\nWait another angle: in Example 0, the output replaces the first two elements with 8 and the rest with zero. So maybe whenever there are two consecutive non-zero numbers in a row, they are summed and placed at the leftmost position, and the others become zero? But in Example 1, the row [0, 0, 3, 2, 0, 0] becomes [0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0]. So here, the 3 and 2 are next to each other, and they are replaced with 8, but in their original positions. Wait no, in the input, 3 and 2 are in positions 2 and 3 (0-based), and the output replaces them with 8 in position 2, then zeros. So maybe the leftmost of the consecutive pair is replaced by their sum, and the others are zeroed. But sum of 3+2=5, but output is 8. Hmm, that doesn't add up. So perhaps there's a different operation.\n\nWait, maybe the numbers are added, but then multiplied by some factor. For example, 3 +2=5. 5 *1.6=8? But that seems arbitrary. Alternatively, maybe it's the product plus their sum. 3*2=6 + 3+2=5 \u2192 11, which isn't 8. Alternatively, 3^2 +2=9+2=11, no.\n\nWait, looking at Example 1's third row in input is [0,3,0,0,0,2], output is [0,8,0,0,0,2]. So 3 and 2 are not adjacent. Wait, but in the input row, the 3 is at position 1, and 2 is at position 5. So maybe they are not consecutive. So perhaps the pattern isn't consecutive numbers. Alternatively, maybe it's the sum of all non-zero elements in the row, but that doesn't fit. For example, in Example 0's first row: sum is 3+2=5. Output row's sum is 8. So that's not matching.\n\nWait, let's look at all examples again.\n\nIn Example 0's input first row: [3,2,0]. Output becomes [8,0,0]. So 3 and 2 are replaced by 8, and the rest are zero.\n\nIn Example 1's input second row: [0,0,3,2,0,0] becomes [0,0,8,0,0,0]. So 3 and 2 are replaced by 8. Another row in Example 1: [0,2,0,0,0,0] in input (row 4) becomes [0,0,0,0,0,0] in output. Wait, but that row has a single 2, so maybe only pairs are considered.\n\nIn Example 2's input third row: [5,0,2,3,0,0,0] becomes [5,0,0,8,0,0,0]. So 2 and 3 are replaced by 8. Similarly, the sixth row in input is [3,2,0,0,0,3,0], output becomes [8,0,0,0,0,8,0]. So here, 3 and 2 (summing to 5?) are replaced by 8, and then 3 and 0 (but no, the output has 8 where the 3 is). Wait, maybe each pair of consecutive non-zero numbers in the row is replaced by their sum multiplied by something. Wait, but in Example 2's sixth row input is [3,2,0,0,0,3,0]. Output is [8,0,0,0,0,8,0]. So the first two elements are 3 and 2, which become 8. Then the 3 is at position 5 (0-based) becomes 8. So perhaps whenever there are two non-zero numbers in the row, they are replaced by 8. But how?\n\nWait, let's see the numbers in the input that become 8 in the output. For Example 0: 3 and 2 \u2192 8. Sum is 5. 3*2=6. 5+3=8? Not sure. 3+2=5, then 5 +3=8? But why add 3 again? Hmm. Alternatively, maybe 3^2 -1 =8. 3 squared is 9 minus 1 is 8. But then 2 would be 2^2=4, but that's not 8. So not sure. Wait, 3*2 +2=8. 3*2=6 +2=8. But why add 2? Not sure.\n\nAnother angle: in Example 0, the first row's non-zero elements are 3 and 2. Output is 8. In Example1's second row, 3 and 2 become 8. In Example2's third row, 2 and 3 become 8. So regardless of order, the sum is 5 but output is 8. Hmm. Wait, 3 + 2 + 3 =8? No. Wait, maybe 3*2 + 2 =8 (3*2=6 +2=8). But why add 2? Maybe the sum multiplied by something. 3+2=5. 5 * 1.6=8. But that's a decimal. Hmm. Alternatively, 3^2 + 2^2 =9 +4=13, no. 3+2*2=7, nope.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the two numbers are added, and then their sum is added to the sum of their positions. For example, in Example0's first row: positions 0 and 1. Sum of numbers 3+2=5, sum of positions 0+1=1. Total 5+1=6. Not 8. No.\n\nAlternatively, the product of the numbers plus the sum. 3*2 +3+2=6+5=11. No. Not 8.\n\nWait, maybe the sum of the two numbers multiplied by 2? 3+2=5*2=10. No. 3+2=5, 5+3=8 (but why add 3 again?)\n\nAlternatively, maybe the sum of the numbers and the number of non-zero elements in the row. In Example0's first row, two non-zero elements. 3+2 +2=7. No. Not 8.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the sum of the numbers plus the number of non-zero elements in the entire matrix. But that would vary per example. For example0, the matrix has 3,2,5. So three non-zero. 3+2+3=8. Wait, 3+2=5, plus 3 (number of non-zero?) 5+3=8. Oh, maybe that's the case. Let's check other examples.\n\nIn Example1, the input second row has 3 and 2. The total non-zero elements in the entire matrix? Let's count:\n\nInput of Example1:\n\nRow0:5, others zero. So 1.\n\nRow1:3,2. So 2.\n\nRow3:3,2. So 2.\n\nRow4:2.\n\nRow5:5,3.\n\nSo total non-zero elements: 1+2+2+1+2=8. So for row1's 3 and 2, 3+2=5, plus 8 (total non-zero) \u2192 13. Not 8. So that doesn't work.\n\nHmm, maybe not.\n\nAlternative approach: perhaps the numbers are being combined in some way, and the rest are set to zero. For example, in Example0, the first row's 3 and 2 become 8. Then the rest are zero. So perhaps in each row, the sum of the first two non-zero numbers is replaced by their sum multiplied by some factor. For example, 3+2=5. 5*1.6=8. But that seems arbitrary.\n\nWait, maybe each pair of non-zero numbers in a row are replaced by their sum plus 3. 3+2=5+3=8. Then in Example1's second row, 3+2=5+3=8. Then in Example2's third row, 2+3=5+3=8. And in Example2's sixth row, the first 3 and 2 become 5+3=8, and the last 3 is perhaps combined with a zero? Wait no. The sixth row input is [3,2,0,0,0,3,0]. Output is [8,0,0,0,0,8,0]. So 3 and 2 become 8, and the 3 at position 5 becomes 8 as well. But that 3 is alone. So how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe any non-zero number that is followed by another non-zero number in the same row is added to it and replaced by 8. But in Example0, the 5 is in the third row, and it remains 5. Because there's no adjacent non-zero. So perhaps only adjacent non-zero pairs are combined. Let's check Example1's row3: input [0,3,0,0,0,2]. Output [0,8,0,0,0,2]. Here, 3 and 2 are not adjacent. So that doesn't fit. Wait, but in the output, the 3 is replaced by 8 and the 2 remains. So maybe it's not about adjacency. Hmm.\n\nAnother thought: perhaps in each row, the sum of all non-zero elements is calculated, then each non-zero element is replaced by that sum. Wait, in Example0's first row, sum is 5. But output is 8. So that's not it. Example1's second row sum is 5. Output is 8. So not matching. So that's not it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each non-zero element is replaced by the sum of all previous non-zero elements in the row plus itself. For example, in Example0's first row, the first element is 3, no previous, so remains 3. The second is 2, previous is 3. Sum 5. But output is 8. No.\n\nWait, looking at Example2's sixth row input: [3,2,0,0,0,3,0]. Output: [8,0,0,0,0,8,0]. So the first two non-zero (3 and 2) become 8, and the 3 at the end becomes 8. So maybe each non-zero element in the input is replaced by 8 if there's another non-zero in the row. But why the 5 in Example0's third row stays 5. Because there's only one non-zero in that row. So perhaps for any row that has two or more non-zero elements, replace each non-zero with 8, and leave zeros as is. But in Example0's first row, two non-zero, replaced by 8. Third row has one non-zero (5), remains 5. But in Example1's output, the first row has a 5 (input 5, others zero). So in that row, only one non-zero, so remains 5. So that could fit. Let's check:\n\nExample0's first row has two non-zero, replaced by 8. Third row has one non-zero, remains.\n\nExample1's second row input has two non-zero (3 and 2), replaced by 8. The fourth row input has 3 and 2 (but they are not adjacent), so output is 8 and 2. Wait, no. The fourth row input is [0,3,0,0,0,2], output is [0,8,0,0,0,2]. So the 3 becomes 8, but the 2 remains. So that contradicts the previous idea. Because that row has two non-zero elements (3 and 2), so according to the idea, both should be 8, but the 2 remains 2. So that's not right.\n\nHmm. So that's not the pattern.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the sum of the first two non-zero elements in each row is replaced by 8, and the others are set to zero. Let's check.\n\nExample0's first row: first two non-zero are 3 and 2. Replace them with 8, others zero \u2192 matches output.\n\nExample1's second row: first two non-zero are 3 and 2. Replace with 8, others zero \u2192 output is [0,0,8,0,0,0], which matches.\n\nExample1's row3: first two non-zero are 3 and 2 (positions 1 and 5). So replace first occurrence (3) with 8, and set the rest (including 2) to zero? No, because in the output, the 2 remains. So that doesn't fit.\n\nWait, in Example1's row3 input [0,3,0,0,0,2], output is [0,8,0,0,0,2]. So the 3 is replaced by 8, and the 2 remains. So that's inconsistent with the previous idea.\n\nSo perhaps the pattern is different. Let's think again.\n\nLooking at the output for Example1's row3: [0,8,0,0,0,2]. So 3 is replaced by 8, and 2 remains. So maybe when there are multiple non-zero elements in the row, each pair is replaced by 8. But why 3 becomes 8 and 2 remains?\n\nWait, maybe each non-zero element in the row that is part of a pair (adjacent?) is replaced by 8, and others remain. But in Example1's row3, 3 and 2 are not adjacent. So perhaps it's not adjacency.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each non-zero element is replaced by the sum of all non-zero elements in the row. Let's check:\n\nExample0's first row: sum 5. Output is 8. No.\n\nExample1's second row: sum 5. Output 8. Doesn't match.\n\nExample2's third row: sum 5+2+3=10. Output has 5 and 8. So that's not matching.\n\nHmm. Let me think differently. Maybe looking at the positions of the non-zero elements. For instance, in Example0's first row, the non-zero are at positions 0 and 1. In the output, the 8 is at position 0, and the others are zero. So maybe the leftmost non-zero in the pair is replaced by 8, and the others are set to zero. But in Example1's second row, the non-zero are at positions 2 and 3. The output has 8 at position 2. So yes, the leftmost of the pair is replaced by 8, others zero. Then in Example2's third row, the non-zero are 5, 2, 3. The output has 5 and 8. So the 5 is left as is, but 2 and 3 are replaced by 8. But why? Maybe the leftmost pair? The 5 is at position 0, then 2 at 2 and 3 at 3. So the first pair is 2 and 3. They are replaced by 8 at position 3? Wait, no. The output is [5,0,0,8,0,0,0]. So 5 remains, then 2 and 3 (positions 2 and 3) become 8 at position 3. Hmm. So maybe the rightmost of the pair? Or the sum is placed at the position of the second element.\n\nAlternatively, when two non-zero elements are found, their sum is replaced in the rightmost position. So 3 and 2 (positions 0 and 1 in Example0) sum to 5. But output is 8. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the first pair of consecutive non-zero elements in a row is replaced by 8. For Example0's first row, the first two elements are non-zero, so replaced by 8. In Example1's second row, the third and fourth elements (3,2) are consecutive, replaced by 8. In Example2's third row, 2 and 3 are consecutive, replaced by 8. In Example2's sixth row, the first two elements (3,2) are consecutive, replaced by 8. Then the 3 at position 5 is alone, so remains, but in the output, it's replaced by 8. Wait, that's conflicting. So the sixth row input is [3,2,0,0,0,3,0], output is [8,0,0,0,0,8,0]. So the first two are replaced by 8, and the 3 at position 5 is replaced by 8. So perhaps all pairs of consecutive non-zero elements are replaced by 8, regardless of their position. But how about the 3 at position 5 in that row. It's not consecutive to any non-zero. So why is it replaced by 8?\n\nAlternatively, maybe any non-zero element that is followed by a non-zero in the same row (not necessarily consecutive) gets replaced by 8. But that's unclear.\n\nWait, let's look at Example2's sixth row input: [3,2,0,0,0,3,0]. The output is [8,0,0,0,0,8,0]. So the first two non-zero (3,2) are replaced by 8. Then the next non-zero is 3 at position 5. Since there's no non-zero after it, but in the output, it's replaced by 8. So perhaps any non-zero element in a row that has at least one other non-zero in the row is replaced by 8, and those with only one non-zero remain. But in that case, in Example1's row3 input [0,3,0,0,0,2], there are two non-zeros. So both should be replaced by 8, but output is [0,8,0,0,0,2]. So the 2 remains as 2. That contradicts the idea.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the first occurrence of two non-zero elements in the row (regardless of position) are replaced by their sum, but the sum is always 8. But 3+2=5, 2+3=5, but output is 8. So maybe it's not sum. Maybe their product plus something. 3*2=6, plus 2 (maybe the number of elements in the pair) \u2192 8. 6 +2=8. For Example0, that works. For Example1's second row, 3*2=6 +2=8. For Example2's third row, 2*3=6+2=8. Example2's sixth row: 3*2=6+2=8, and the next 3 is alone. So why is it replaced by 8? Unless the row has multiple pairs. For example, in Example2's sixth row input: [3,2,0,0,0,3,0], the first pair is 3 and 2 \u2192 8. Then the 3 at position5 is alone, but maybe since there's another non-zero in the row (the first 3 and 2), all non-zero elements are replaced by 8. But then in Example1's row3 input [0,3,0,0,0,2], the 3 and 2 are not consecutive, but in output, 3 becomes 8, and 2 remains. So that's inconsistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the first two non-zero elements in each row are replaced by 8, regardless of their positions, and the rest remain. But in Example2's sixth row, there are three non-zero elements (3,2,3). The first two (3,2) are replaced by 8, and the third (3) is replaced by 8 as well. So that's three non-zero elements, all replaced by 8. But in Example1's row3 input [0,3,0,0,0,2], two non-zero elements, replaced by 8 and 2 remains. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe any non-zero element that is part of a group (even if separated by zeros) is replaced by 8. So if there are multiple non-zeros in the row, all are replaced by 8, except those in rows with exactly one non-zero. Let's check:\n\nExample0's first row has two non-zero \u2192 replaced by 8. Third row has one \u2192 remains.\n\nExample1's row1 has two non-zero \u2192 replaced by 8. Row3 has two non-zero \u2192 both replaced by 8? But in the output, one is replaced and the other remains. So that's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the first non-zero element in each row is replaced by 8, and others are set to zero. But Example0's first row has 3 and 2. Output is 8,0,0. So that fits. Example1's second row: first non-zero is 3 at position2 \u2192 replaced by8. The next non-zero is 2 \u2192 set to zero. Which matches the output. Example2's third row: first non-zero is5 (position0), so remains 5. Next non-zero are 2 and 3. So according to this idea, 5 remains, but others are replaced by 8? But output has 5 and 8. Hmm, maybe not.\n\nThis is getting tricky. Let's try another approach. Let's look for the transformation of the numbers.\n\nLooking at all the input numbers that become 8 in the output:\n\nIn Example0: 3 and 2 \u2192 8.\n\nIn Example1: 3 and 2 \u21928. Also, in row3, 3 \u21928.\n\nIn Example2: 2 and 3 \u21928. 3 and 2 \u21928. 3 \u21928, and another 3\u21928.\n\nWait, so it's not just pairs. Sometimes single numbers are turned into 8. For instance, Example1's row3 has 3 and 2. Output is 8 and 2. So the 3 becomes8, but the 2 remains. Then in Example2's row6, the 3 and 2 become8, and the other 3 becomes8. So why the 2 in Example1's row3 remains 2?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is: for each non-zero element in a row, if there's another non-zero element to its right (in the same row), replace it with 8. Otherwise, leave it as is.\n\nIn Example0's first row: 3 has a non-zero to the right (2), so replace 3 with8. 2 has no non-zero to its right (0), so remains. But output is 8,0. So that's not it.\n\nAlternatively, replace any non-zero element that has a non-zero after it (anywhere in the row) with 8. Let's see:\n\nExample0's first row: 3 has 2 after it. So replace 3 with8. 2 has no non-zero after it (zeros). So replace 2 with zero? But output is 8,0. Which matches.\n\nExample1's row1: 3 has 2 after it. So replace 3 with8. 2 has no non-zero after it (zeros). Replace 2 with zero. So output is 8,0. Which matches.\n\nExample1's row3:3 has a non-zero 2 after it (even though there are zeros in between). So replace 3 with8. The 2 has no non-zero after it. So replace 2 with zero. But output is [0,8,0,0,0,2]. So the 2 remains. Hmm, that's a contradiction.\n\nExample2's row6:3 has 2 after it. Replace 3 with8. The 2 has 3 after it (position5). So replace 2 with8. The 3 at position5 has no non-zero after it. So replace with zero. But output is [8,0,0,0,0,8,0]. So both 3 and 2 are replaced by8, and the 3 at position5 is replaced by8. So according to this idea, the 3 at position5 is replaced by8 even though there's no non-zero after it. So that doesn't fit.\n\nThis is getting too confusing. Let's think of another pattern. Maybe the sum of all pairs of non-zero elements in the entire matrix, but that seems off.\n\nWait, looking at the numbers that become 8: they are either 3 and 2, or 2 and3, or single 3s. But how does 3 and 2 lead to 8?\n\nWait, 3*2 +2=8. Or 3+2*2.5=8. Maybe it's 3*2 +2=8. But then what about a single 3? Why would a single 3 become 8?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the numbers are transformed based on their value: 3 becomes 8, 2 becomes 0, and 5 remains. But in Example0's first row, 3 and2 become8 and0. Third row's 5 remains. In Example1's row1, 3 and2 become8 and0. In Example2's third row, 2 and3 become0 and8. But wait, in Example2's sixth row input, 3 and2 become8 and0, but the other 3 becomes8. So maybe any 3 in a row with at least one other non-zero becomes8. And any 2 in a row with a 3 becomes0. Otherwise, they remain. Let's test this.\n\nExample0's first row:3 and2. So 3 becomes8, 2 becomes0. Output [8,0,0].\n\nExample1's row1:3 and2. 3\u21928, 2\u21920. Output [0,0,8,0,0,0].\n\nExample1's row3:3 and2. 3\u21928, 2\u21920. But output is [0,8,0,0,0,2]. So 2 remains. This contradicts.\n\nExample2's row6:3,2,3. 3\u21928, 2\u21920, 3\u21928. Output [8,0,0,0,0,8,0]. This fits.\n\nBut why in Example1's row3 the 2 remains? Because maybe the 2 is not adjacent to a 3. So the rule could be that in a row, any 3 or 2 that is adjacent to another 3 or 2 is replaced by 8 or 0. For example, if a 3 is adjacent to a 2, replace them with 8 and 0. But if a 3 is not adjacent to a 2, replace it with 8? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps any occurrence of 3 followed by 2 in the same row (regardless of position) is replaced by 8, and the 2 is set to 0. Any standalone 3 is replaced by8. But in Example1's row3, the 3 and2 are not adjacent. The row is [0,3,0,0,0,2]. So the 3 and 2 are separated by zeros. But in the output, 3 is replaced by8, and 2 remains. So this idea would not explain that.\n\nHmm. Maybe it's time to look for a different pattern. Perhaps the numbers are replaced with 8 if they are part of a consecutive sequence of non-zero numbers, and the sum of those numbers is multiplied by something. Or perhaps the sum is replaced with 8 regardless of their values. For example, any pair of non-zero numbers in a row are summed and replaced with8. So regardless of their values, if they are non-zero and adjacent, they become8. But then how does that work for single numbers?\n\nWait, let's look at Example2's sixth row input: [3,2,0,0,0,3,0]. Output: [8,0,0,0,0,8,0]. So the first two non-zero (3 and2) become8, and the next 3 becomes8. So maybe in each row, all non-zero elements are replaced by8, except when there's only one non-zero. But in Example1's row3, the input has two non-zero (3 and2), but output has 8 and 2. So that contradicts.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the sum of all non-zero elements in the row is replaced by8, but that's not the case.\n\nExample0's first row sum is5. Output row's sum is8.\n\nExample1's second row sum is5. Output row's sum is8.\n\nExample2's third row sum is10. Output row's sum is5+8=13. So that doesn't fit.\n\nThis is really challenging. Let's think of another angle. Maybe looking at the positions where the 8s appear in the output. For example, in Example0's first row, 8 is in the first position. The two non-zero elements were in positions0 and1. So maybe the 8 is placed at the leftmost position of the pair.\n\nExample1's second row: non-zero at positions2 and3. 8 is placed at position2.\n\nExample2's third row: non-zero at positions2 and3. 8 placed at position3 (the rightmost). Wait, no. The input row is [5,0,2,3,0,0,0], output is [5,0,0,8,0,0,0]. So 2 and3 are replaced by8 at position3. So the rightmost position of the pair.\n\nExample2's sixth row: [3,2,0,0,0,3,0] becomes [8,0,0,0,0,8,0]. So the first pair (3,2) replaced by8 at position0. The 3 at position5 becomes8 at position5.\n\nSo perhaps when two non-zero elements are found consecutively, they are replaced by8 at the leftmost position. If they are not consecutive, but in the same row, perhaps each is replaced by8 individually. But in Example1's row3, the input has 3 and2 separated by zeros. Output has 3 replaced by8 and 2 remains. So why is 2 not replaced?\n\nAlternatively, maybe any non-zero element in a row where there's at least one other non-zero element (anywhere in the row) is replaced by8, and zeros remain. So in rows with more than one non-zero, all non-zero become8. But in Example1's row3, input has two non-zero. So output should have both as8, but output has 8 and2. So that's not right.\n\nWait, perhaps the transformation is: for each row, if there are two or more non-zero elements, replace each non-zero element with8. If only one, leave it as is. But let's check:\n\nExample0's first row: two non-zero \u2192 replaced by8, others zero. Output matches.\n\nExample1's row1: two non-zero \u2192 replaced by8. Output matches.\n\nExample1's row3: two non-zero \u2192 both replaced by8. But output is [0,8,0,0,0,2]. So the 2 remains. So that contradicts.\n\nExample2's sixth row: three non-zero \u2192 all replaced by8. Output has two 8s. So that's inconsistent.\n\nHmm. Maybe the rule is that whenever two non-zero elements are present in a row, their sum is replaced by8, and the other elements are zeroed. But how to decide which elements to replace.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the sum of all pairs of non-zero elements in the entire matrix is replaced by8, but that's unclear.\n\nAnother possibility: look for a mathematical relationship. For example, 3 and 2 make 8. How? 3 + 2 =5, 5 +3=8. Or 3*2 +2=8. Similarly, 2*3 +2=8. So any two numbers a and b where a*b + (a or b) =8. For example, 3*2 +2=8. 2*3 +2=8. What about a single 3? 3*1 +5=8. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the sum of the numbers multiplied by 2 minus something. 3+2=5. 5*2-2=8. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, binary: 3 in binary is 11, 2 is 10. 11+10=101 (5), but that's not 8. Hmm.\n\nWait, let's look at the test input now and see if applying some pattern we can guess. But perhaps that's not helpful. Alternatively, think of the output numbers being 8. So 8 is 2^3, but not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the numbers are being replaced by the sum of their digits multiplied by something. But 3 and2 sum to5. 5*1.6=8. Not sure.\n\nAnother approach: perhaps each pair of non-zero numbers in a row are summed, and then added to the sum of their positions. For example, in Example0's first row: 3 and2. Sum is5. Positions 0 and1 sum to1. 5+1=6. Not 8. No.\n\nAlternatively, sum of the numbers plus their product. 3+2 +3*2=5+6=11. No.\n\nAlternatively, multiply the numbers and add the sum. 3*2 +3+2=6+5=11. No.\n\nAlternatively, the sum of all non-zero elements in the entire matrix is added to each non-zero element. For Example0, the sum is3+2+5=10. So each non-zero becomes 3+10=13, 2+10=12, 5+10=15. But output is 8. So that's not it.\n\nThis is really challenging. Let's try to find another pattern.\n\nLooking at Example1's row3 input [0,3,0,0,0,2], output [0,8,0,0,0,2]. So the 3 becomes8, and the 2 remains. What's special about this case? The 3 and2 are in the same row but not adjacent. So perhaps the first non-zero element in the row is replaced by8, and others are left as is. But then in Example0's first row, the 3 is replaced by8, and the 2 is replaced by0. So that's not consistent.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the first non-zero in the row is replaced by the sum of all non-zero elements in the row. Example0's first row sum is5. Output is8. So not matching.\n\nAlternatively, the sum of the row's non-zero elements plus the number of non-zero elements. For Example0's first row:5+2=7. No.\n\nWait, maybe each non-zero element is replaced by the number of non-zero elements in its row multiplied by 4. For Example0's first row has two non-zero elements: 2*4=8. So each becomes8. Output is [8,0,0]. Example1's row1 has two non-zero: 2*4=8. Output is [0,0,8,0,0,0]. So that fits. Example1's row3 has two non-zero, so each should be 8. But output is [0,8,0,0,0,2]. So one 8 and one 2. So this doesn't fit.\n\nExample2's third row has three non-zero elements (5,2,3). 3*4=12, but output has 5 and8. So that's not it.\n\nHmm. Maybe the number of non-zero elements in the row is added to the sum of the non-zero elements. For Example0's first row:5+2=7. Not 8. So no.\n\nAlternatively, the product of the number of non-zero elements and the sum. For Example0's first row:2*5=10. No.\n\nThis is getting frustrating. Let's try to think differently.\n\nIn Example0's first row: 3 and 2 \u21928. Maybe 3 + 2 +3 (the row index?) The row index is0. 3+2+0=5. No.\n\nIn Example1's second row (row1):3+2 +1=6. No. Output is8.\n\nAlternatively, the row index plus sum of elements. Row0:0+5=5. No. Output is8.\n\nHmm. Maybe it's the sum of the elements multiplied by the row index plus 1. For Example0's first row (row0):5*(0+1)=5. No.\n\nThis is not working. Let's look at the test input and see what happens.\n\nTest Input:\n\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 5]\n[0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 2, 0]\n[0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 2]\n[5, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0]\n[5, 3, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 2, 0]\n\nWe need to apply the pattern to this.\n\nLooking for rows where there are pairs of non-zero numbers. For example, the first row has 2 and5. Are they adjacent? They are at positions4 and8, separated by zeros. So not adjacent. The second row has 2,3,2. 2 is at position1, 3 at6, 2 at7. So 3 and2 are adjacent. The fourth row has5 and2 (positions4 and8). Not adjacent. The seventh row has5,3,5,2. \n\nAssuming that whenever two non-zero elements are adjacent, they are replaced by8. Let's see:\n\nTest Input row1 (second row): [0,2,0,0,0,0,3,2,0]. The elements at positions6 and7 are3 and2, adjacent. So replace them with8. So the output for this row would be [0,2,0,0,0,0,8,0,0]. But according to the pattern in training examples, maybe the first two non-zero elements in the row are replaced. Let's see. The first non-zero is2 at position1, then3 at6, then2 at7. Are there any adjacent pairs? 3 and2 are adjacent. So they would be replaced by8. So the row becomes [0,2,0,0,0,0,8,0,0].\n\nBut in Example1's row3, the non-adjacent3 and2 are replaced by8 and 2. So in this case, if the 3 and2 are adjacent, they become8.\n\nThen, in the seventh row of the test input: [5,3,0,0,0,5,0,2,0]. The first two elements are5 and3, adjacent. So replaced by8. Then there's5 and2. They are not adjacent. So replace5 and2 with8? Not sure. Or perhaps each pair of adjacent non-zero is replaced. So 5 and3 become8, 5 and2 are not adjacent. So the row becomes [8,0,0,0,0,5,0,2,0]. But in the training examples, sometimes non-adjacent pairs are replaced. For example, Example2's sixth row input has3 and2 in positions0 and1 (adjacent), replaced by8, and another3 in position5 which becomes8. So maybe any non-zero elements in the row are replaced by8 if there's at least one other non-zero in the row. \n\nIn that case, the test input's first row has2 and5. So both would become8. The output row would be [0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,8].\n\nSecond row:2,3,2. All would become8. But according to Example1's row3, when two non-adjacent non-zero elements are present, one becomes8 and the other remains. So this is conflicting.\n\nAlternatively, if the row has two or more non-zero elements, replace all non-zero elements with8.\n\nTest Input first row has two non-zero (2 and5) \u2192 replaced by8. Output [0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,8].\n\nSecond row has three non-zero \u2192 all replaced by8. Output [0,8,0,0,0,0,8,8,0].\n\nThird row has one non-zero (3) \u2192 remains.\n\nFourth row has5 and2 \u2192 two non-zero \u2192 replaced by8. Output [0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,8].\n\nFifth row has5 and2 \u2192 two non-zero \u2192 replaced by8. Output [8,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,0].\n\nSixth row has3 \u2192 remains.\n\nSeventh row has5,3,5,2 \u2192 four non-zero \u2192 all replaced by8. Output [8,8,0,0,0,8,0,8,0].\n\nBut let's check against the training examples.\n\nExample1's row3 input [0,3,0,0,0,2] has two non-zero. If the rule is to replace all with8, then output should be [0,8,0,0,0,8]. But the actual output is [0,8,0,0,0,2]. So this contradicts. Hence, this pattern is invalid.\n\nThis suggests that the pattern is not simply replacing all non-zero in a row with8 if there are two or more. \n\nAnother approach: perhaps the transformation is to replace each pair of non-zero elements in the row (left to right) with8, but if there's an odd number of non-zeros, the last one remains. But how?\n\nIn Example0's first row: two non-zero \u2192 replaced by8. Third row: one non-zero \u2192 remains.\n\nExample1's row1: two non-zero \u2192 replaced by8. Row3: two non-zero \u2192 replaced by8 and 2. So that doesn't fit.\n\nExample2's sixth row: three non-zero. First two replaced by8, last one replaced by8. So three becomes two 8s.\n\nThis is getting too time-consuming. Let's make a guess based on the training examples and the test input.\n\nLooking at the test input's seventh row: [5,3,0,0,0,5,0,2,0]. The first two elements are5 and3, which are adjacent non-zero. So according to the pattern in the training examples, they would be replaced by8. Then there's5, which is non-adjacent to others (assuming the next non-zero is2). But in Example2's sixth row, a non-adjacent 3 is replaced by8. So perhaps any non-zero in a row with at least one other non-zero is replaced by8. So in this row, all four non-zero elements (5,3,5,2) become8. So the output row would be [8,8,0,0,0,8,0,8,0].\n\nFor the test input's fifth row: [5,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0]. Two non-zero elements (5 and2) not adjacent. So according to Example1's row3, perhaps the first non-zero (5) becomes8, and the second (2) remains. So output would be [8,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0]. But in Example2's third row, the non-adjacent 2 and3 are replaced by8. So maybe if there are multiple non-zero elements in the row, all are replaced by8.\n\nBut there's inconsistency in the training examples, making it hard to pinpoint. \n\nGiven the time I've spent and the need to provide an answer, I'll proceed with the assumption that any pair of non-zero elements in a row (regardless of adjacency) are replaced by8, with the leftmost one becoming8 and the others set to zero. For single non-zero elements, they remain. For multiple non-zero elements, each pair is replaced by8 leftmost. But this is a guess.\n\nApplying this to the test input:\n\nRow0: [0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,5] has two non-zero. Replace leftmost (2) with8, set 5 to zero. Output: [0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0].\n\nRow1: [0,2,0,0,0,0,3,2,0] has three non-zero: 2,3,2. Replace first pair (2 and3). But they are not adjacent. So replace the first non-zero (2) with8, set others to zero? Or maybe each pair is considered. It's unclear. Maybe each pair is replaced, leading to multiple 8s. But this is unclear. Given the time, I'll proceed with the pattern observed in Example2's sixth row, where multiple non-zero elements are replaced by8. \n\nFinal answer (guess):\n\nThe output replaces each pair of non-zero elements in a row with 8, left to right, and sets others to zero. If there's an odd non-zero, the last remains. But this is uncertain.",

        "cot_2": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. So, the problem is to transform the input matrix into the output by some rule. Let me look at the training examples to see what's going on.\n\nStarting with Example 0. The input is:\n\n[3, 2, 0]\n[0, 0, 0]\n[0, 5, 0]\n\nAnd the output is:\n\n[8, 0, 0]\n[0, 0, 0]\n[0, 5, 0]\n\nHmm. The first row changes from [3,2,0] to [8,0,0]. 3 and 2 sum to 5, but 8 is there. Wait, maybe it's adding adjacent numbers? Like 3 + 5 (from the third row's 5?), but that's in different rows. Or maybe looking at the same position across rows? Let's check other examples.\n\nIn Example 1, the input has multiple rows. The second row's [0,0,3,2,0,0] becomes [0,0,8,0,0,0]. The 3 and 2 sum to 5, but here it's 8. Wait, 3 + 2 =5, but 8 is more than that. Oh, maybe it's 3 + 2 multiplied by something. 3+2=5, multiplied by... but 5*1.6 is 8? No, that's not an integer. Alternatively, maybe the sum is converted to the next power of two? 5 is between 4 and 8, so maybe it rounds up to 8. That's possible.\n\nLooking at Example 0: 3 +2 =5 \u2192 8. Example1, 3+2=5\u21928 again. In Example2, let's check. The third row in the input is [5,0,2,3,0,0,0], output is [5,0,0,8,0,0,0]. So 2+3=5 \u21928. Similarly, in the sixth row of input in Example2, the input is [3,2,0,0,0,3,0], which becomes [8,0,0,0,0,8,0]. So 3+2=5\u21928 and 3 in the last position? Wait, maybe 3+3=6, which would then become 8 again. Wait, but the first part of that row is 3 and 2, which sum to 5\u21928, and then the next 3 is alone. So maybe it's not just summing adjacent numbers. Alternatively, maybe each pair of consecutive non-zero numbers in a row are summed and replaced by 8 if their sum is 5?\n\nWait, but in Example0, the first row has 3 and 2, which are next to each other and sum to 5. They are replaced by 8. Then in Example1's second row, 3 and 2 are consecutive, replaced by 8. In Example2, the third row has 2 and 3 consecutive, sum to 5 \u21928. The sixth row in input has 3 and 2, sum to 5\u21928, and then another 3 which is next to a 0. But the output has another 8 where the 3 was. Wait, maybe if there's a 3 followed by a 2, they sum to 5 and become 8. But in the sixth row of Example2 input, the row is [3,2,0,0,0,3,0]. The output is [8,0,0,0,0,8,0]. So first 3+2=5\u21928, and then the last 3 is replaced by 8. That doesn't fit the previous pattern. Wait, maybe there's another rule here. The last 3 in the input is in position 5 (0-based index 5?), and in the output, the 8 is at position 5. So maybe if a 3 is followed by a 2 or preceded by a 2, but in this case, the 3 is next to 0. Hmm, maybe the 3 in the sixth row's end is part of another pair?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's the sum of numbers in the same column. Let's check Example0. The first column has 3,0,0. Sum is 3. The output's first column is 8. That doesn't add up. Maybe columns aren't the key.\n\nAnother angle: Maybe the transformation is that whenever two numbers in the same row add up to 5, they are replaced by 8. But in Example0, 3+2=5, so they are replaced by 8 and the others set to 0. So the first row's 3 and 2 become 8, and the rest are 0. Similarly, in Example1's second row, 3 and 2 are adjacent, sum to 5, replaced by 8. But in Example2's sixth row, there are two 3s and a 2. Wait, the input row is [3,2,0,0,0,3,0]. So 3+2=5 becomes 8. Then the next 3 is followed by 0, but in the output, that 3 is replaced by 8. So maybe if a 3 is not part of a pair, it's left as is? Or maybe there's another rule here.\n\nWait, in Example2's sixth row input: [3,2,0,0,0,3,0] \u2192 output [8,0,0,0,0,8,0]. So the first 3 and 2 sum to 5 \u21928. The last 3 is replaced by 8. But why? 3 alone. Maybe if there's a 3 or 2 that's not part of a pair summing to 5, it's turned into 8 as well? But that doesn't fit Example0's 5 in the third row. The third row in Example0's input is [0,5,0], and in the output, it's left as [0,5,0]. So the 5 stays. So maybe 5s are left alone. So perhaps the rule is: in each row, for each consecutive pair of numbers, if their sum is 5, replace them with an 8 and set the other elements to zero. But how does this work when there are multiple pairs or overlapping?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is to find all pairs of numbers in the same row that are adjacent and sum to 5, then replace each such pair with an 8 and set the other elements in that row to zero. Wait, but in Example0's first row, after replacing 3 and 2 with 8, the rest are zeros. In Example1's second row, 3 and 2 are replaced by 8, others are zero. But in Example2's sixth row, there are two separate 3 and 2 pairs. Wait, the input row is [3,2,0,0,0,3,0]. So the first two elements sum to 5, replaced by 8, and then the 3 in position 5 is followed by a zero, but in the output, it's replaced by 8. So that doesn't fit the initial idea. So maybe if a 3 is alone, it's replaced by 8? But why? Or maybe any 3 or 2 in the input, regardless of position, is converted to 8, but that's not the case because in Example0's third row, the 5 remains. Also, in Example1's fifth row input [0,2,0,0,0,0], output is [0,0,0,0,0,0]. Wait, in that row, there's a 2. If it's converted to 8, but in the output, it's 0. So that can't be.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that in each row, all instances of 3 and 2 are replaced with 8, but only when they are adjacent. Wait, but in Example0's first row, 3 and 2 are adjacent and replaced by 8, and the rest are 0. But in Example2's sixth row, the 3 and 2 are replaced by 8, but the 3 at the end is replaced by 8 even though it's not adjacent to a 2. So perhaps the rule is that all 3s and 2s in the row are replaced by 8, but only if they are part of a pair that sums to 5. But then, in Example1's fifth row input [0,2,0,0,0,0], the 2 is not adjacent to a 3, so it's set to 0. But in the output for Example1's fifth row, the entire row becomes [0,0,0,0,0,0], so the 2 is turned to 0. So maybe the rule is that any 2 or 3 in a row is replaced by 8 only if there's a pair (3 and 2) summing to 5. Otherwise, they are zeroed.\n\nWait, this is getting complicated. Let's look for another pattern. Let's check the sum of the elements in the input row versus the output row.\n\nIn Example0, input first row sum is 5 (3+2). Output is 8. So 5 \u21928.\n\nIn Example1's second row, input sum is 5 (3+2). Output is 8. Similarly, other rows in Example1: third row has sum 0 \u21920. Fourth row input sum is 3+2=5, but in output it's 8+2=10. Wait, no. Input row is [0,3,0,0,0,2], sum 5. Output row is [0,8,0,0,0,2], sum 10. So the 3 and 2 are not adjacent here. So the 3 is in position 1 and the 2 in position 5. Since they are not adjacent, they are not summed to 8. But in the output, the 3 is replaced by 8. So maybe any 3 in the row is replaced by 8, and any 2 is replaced by 0, but only if there's a 3 somewhere else in the row. Or maybe it's something else.\n\nWait, in the fourth row of Example1's input: [0,3,0,0,0,2], output is [0,8,0,0,0,2]. So the 3 becomes 8, but the 2 remains. Hmm. But in the fifth row of the same example, input [0,2,0,0,0,0] becomes [0,0,0,0,0,0]. So the 2 is turned to 0. So why in the fourth row's output, the 2 remains? Because in that row, there's a 3 turned into 8. But the 2 is left as 2. That's inconsistent. Unless the 2 is part of another pair. Wait, but the 2 is at the end. Maybe there's a different rule when there's a 3 and a 2 in the same row, even if they are not adjacent. Let's think again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each 3 and 2 in the entire matrix is replaced by 8, but that's not the case. For instance, in Example0's third row, the 5 remains. So the 5 is left as is. Also, in Example2's output, there's a 5. So 5s are kept. What about numbers other than 2,3,5? For example, in Example2's input, the last row has a 5, which remains in the output. So 5 is left as is. So maybe the rule is: replace all 3s and 2s with 8, but only if they are part of a pair summing to 5. Wait, but how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the sum of all 3s and 2s in a row is converted to 8, but that doesn't explain the positions. For example, in Example0's first row, there's 3 and 2 (sum 5) \u21928. So 5 is replaced by 8. So 5 becomes 8. But in Example2's third row input, the sum of 2 and 3 is 5 \u21928. Then in the sixth row, sum of 3+2=5 and another 3. So maybe each occurrence of a 5 (sum) is replaced by 8. So any 2 and 3 that sum to 5 in a row are replaced by 8, and the rest are zeroed. But how about when they are not adjacent?\n\nWait, in Example1's fourth row input: [0,3,0,0,0,2]. The sum of 3 and 2 is 5, but they are not adjacent. The output is [0,8,0,0,0,2]. So the 3 is replaced by 8, but the 2 remains. So maybe the rule is that any 3 in the row is replaced by 8, but any 2 is replaced by 8 only if it's adjacent to a 3. Otherwise, the 2 is set to 0. But in Example1's fifth row, the 2 is not adjacent to a 3, so it's set to 0. But in the fourth row, the 2 is not adjacent to a 3 but is kept as 2. Wait, that contradicts. So perhaps my initial approach is wrong.\n\nAnother angle: Let's look at the positions where 8 appears in the output. For example0, the first row's first element is 8. The input was 3 and 2 in the first two positions. So maybe the first occurrence of a pair summing to 5 in the row is replaced by 8 in the leftmost position, and others are zeroed. But in Example2's sixth row input: [3,2,0,0,0,3,0], the output is [8,0,0,0,0,8,0]. So two 8s. The first pair (3,2) becomes 8, and then the last 3 becomes 8. But why? Unless there's another pair. The last 3 is not adjacent to anything. So maybe the rule is that each 3 and 2 in the row, regardless of adjacency, are summed as a pair. But how? Maybe the total sum of 3s and 2s in the row is converted to 8 multiplied by the number of pairs. For example, if the sum is 5, replace with 8. If sum is 10 (two pairs), replace with two 8s. But in Example2's sixth row input, there are two 3s and one 2. Sum is 3+2+3=8. But how does that get converted to two 8s?\n\nAlternatively, maybe each 3 and 2 in the row is replaced by 8, and the rest set to zero, but that doesn't explain the positions. For example, in Example0's first row input, the 3 and 2 are replaced by a single 8. But if we replace each 3 and 2 with 8, then the row would have two 8s, but the output has one. So that's not it.\n\nWait, maybe the rule is to scan the row from left to right, and whenever a 3 is found, check if the next element is 2. If so, replace both with 8 and set the rest to zero. If a 2 is found, check if the previous element is 3. Replace both with 8. But in Example2's sixth row, the input is [3,2,0,0,0,3,0]. The first pair is 3 and 2 \u21928. Then there's a 3 at position 5. Since there's no 2 after it, perhaps it's left as 8? Or perhaps if there's a 3 not followed by a 2, it's replaced by 8, but in Example0's third row, there's a 5 that remains. So 5s are left alone.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is: for each row, combine all 3s and 2s (regardless of position) into a sum. If their sum is a multiple of 5, replace each such occurrence with 8. But in Example0's first row, sum is 5 \u21928. In Example2's sixth row, sum is 3+2+3=8 (wait, 3+2+3=8? No, that's 8. But 8 isn't a multiple of 5. Hmm, this seems off.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each occurrence of 3 followed by 2 is replaced by 8, and each occurrence of 2 followed by 3 is also replaced by 8, and the rest of the elements are set to zero. But in Example0's first row, it's 3 then 2 \u21928. In Example2's sixth row, 3 followed by 2 becomes 8, and then the last 3 is followed by 0, so maybe it's left as 8? But why? That doesn't fit. Also, in Example1's fourth row, the 3 and 2 are not adjacent but are replaced by 8 and 2. So that doesn't fit.\n\nThis is getting a bit tricky. Let's think of another approach. Let's check the number of 3s and 2s in each row. For example, in Example0's first row: 1 three and 1 two. Output: sum 5 becomes 8. In Example1's second row: 3 and 2 \u21928. Example2's third row: 2 and 3 \u21928. The sixth row has two 3s and one 2. So sum is 3+2+3=8. So maybe the sum of all 3s and 2s in the row is converted to 8 multiplied by the number of pairs. But how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each 3 and 2 in the row is converted to 8, and the rest set to zero. So for example, in Example0's first row, 3 and 2 become 8 and 8, but the output is [8,0,0]. That doesn't fit. So that's not the case.\n\nWait, maybe the rule is that each time a 3 and a 2 appear in the same row (anywhere), they are replaced by an 8 in the leftmost position where either a 3 or 2 was. All other elements are set to zero. But then, in Example1's fourth row, the 3 is replaced by 8 and the 2 remains. Hmm, that's confusing.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 3 and 2 are summed, and their sum is replaced by 8, but any other 3s or 2s in the row are replaced by zero. But in Example2's sixth row, after replacing the first 3 and 2 with 8, the remaining 3 is replaced by 8. So that's conflicting.\n\nAlternatively, let's think about the numbers 3, 2, 5. 3+2=5. 5 is replaced by 8. Wait, but in Example0's third row, the 5 is left as is. So that can't be it.\n\nWait, in Example0's output, the third row is [0,5,0]. The input was the same. So 5 remains. So maybe whenever a number is 5, it's left. 3 and 2 are replaced by 8 when they are adjacent. But if they are not adjacent, then they are turned into 8 if there's another 3 or 2 in the row. Or maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule is that in each row, any 3 or 2 is replaced by 8, and other numbers are set to zero. But then, why in Example1's fourth row, the 2 in the last position remains as 2 in the output. That contradicts.\n\nLooking at Example1's fourth row input: [0,3,0,0,0,2]. Output: [0,8,0,0,0,2]. So the 3 is replaced by 8, but the 2 remains. Why? That's confusing. Also, the fifth row of Example1's input has [0,2,0,0,0,0], output [0,0,0,0,0,0]. So the 2 is replaced by 0. So in one case, a 2 is kept, in another, it's set to 0. So there's more to the pattern.\n\nAnother approach: Let's compare the positions of the numbers. For example, in Example1's second row input: [0,0,3,2,0,0] becomes [0,0,8,0,0,0]. The 3 and 2 are adjacent, replaced by 8 in the position of the 3. Similarly, in Example0's first row, 3 and 2 are replaced by 8 in the first position. Wait, no. The input's first two elements are 3 and 2. Output's first element is 8, others zero. So the 8 is placed in the first position, and the rest are zeroed. So perhaps when two adjacent numbers sum to 5, they are replaced by an 8 in the leftmost position of the pair, and the other positions are zeroed. Then, any other numbers in the row are zeroed.\n\nBut in Example2's sixth row input: [3,2,0,0,0,3,0], the output is [8,0,0,0,0,8,0]. So the first pair (3,2) becomes 8 in position 0. Then the 3 in position 5 is replaced by 8. But why? Because maybe there's another 3 and 2 elsewhere? No, the 3 in position 5 is followed by a 0. So perhaps the rule is that any 3 or 2 in the row is replaced by 8, regardless of adjacency, and others are zeroed. But that doesn't fit with Example1's fourth row.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is to find all pairs of 3 and 2 in the row (adjacent or not), sum them to 5, convert each such pair to an 8, and place each 8 in the position of the 3. The 2s are then set to zero. Any remaining 3s or 2s not paired are also set to zero. But in Example2's sixth row, there's a 3 followed by 2 (positions 0 and 1) \u21928 at 0, then a 3 at position 5. Since there's no 2 to pair with, that 3 is set to zero. But in the output, it's replaced by 8. So that doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. Let's think differently. What if the rule is to replace each 3 and 2 with 8, but only when they are adjacent. For example, in a row, scan left to right. When a 3 is found, check if the next element is 2. If yes, replace them with 8 and set the rest to zero. If a 2 is found and the previous is 3, replace with 8. Other 3s and 2s are set to zero. But how does this explain the sixth row in Example2's input?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is that any time a 3 is followed by a 2, they are replaced by an 8 in the first position, and the rest of the row is zeroed. Then, any 3 not followed by a 2 is set to zero. Similarly, any 2 not preceded by a 3 is set to zero. So in Example0's first row, 3 is followed by 2 \u21928, and the rest are zero. In Example1's second row, 3 is followed by 2 \u21928, rest zero. In Example2's sixth row, first 3 is followed by 2 \u21928, then the next 3 is not followed by a 2 \u21920, but in the output, it's 8. So that doesn't fit. So this can't be the rule.\n\nWait, in Example2's sixth row input, the last 3 is at position 5. In the output, position 5 is 8. So maybe there's another 2 somewhere else in the row. Let's check. The input is [3,2,0,0,0,3,0]. The only 2 is in position 1. So the 3 in position 5 is not followed by a 2, but in the output, it's replaced by 8. So perhaps the rule is that any 3 in the row is replaced by 8, and any 2 is replaced by 0. But in Example1's fourth row, the 3 is replaced by 8 and the 2 is left as 2. Hmm, inconsistency.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule is that any 3 or 2 in the row is replaced by 8, but only if there's at least one other 3 or 2 in the row. Otherwise, they are zero. For example, in Example0's first row, there are two numbers (3 and 2) \u2192 replaced by 8. In Example1's fifth row, a single 2 \u2192 replaced by 0. In Example1's fourth row, there's a 3 and a 2, so both are replaced by 8. But wait, in the output of Example1's fourth row, the 3 is replaced by 8, but the 2 remains as 2. So that contradicts.\n\nThis is really confusing. Let me look at all the training examples again.\n\nExample0 Input:\nRow 0: [3,2,0] \u2192 output [8,0,0]\nRow 1: [0,0,0] \u2192 same\nRow 2: [0,5,0] \u2192 same.\n\nExample1 Input:\nRow1: [0,0,3,2,0,0] \u2192 [0,0,8,0,0,0]\nRow3: [0,3,0,0,0,2] \u2192 [0,8,0,0,0,2]\nRow4: [0,2,0,0,0,0] \u2192 [0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nSo in row3 of Example1, the 3 is replaced by 8, but the 2 remains. But in row4, the 2 is replaced by 0. Why the difference? Because in row3, there's a 3 and a 2, but not adjacent. So maybe when a 3 and 2 exist in the same row (anywhere), they are both replaced by 8, but other numbers are left as is. But in row3's output, the 2 remains as 2. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe in each row, the sum of all 3s and 2s is calculated. If the sum is 5 (like 3+2), it's replaced with 8. If sum is higher, maybe replace each contributing pair with 8. But in Example2's sixth row, sum is 3+2+3=8. The output has two 8s. 8 /5 = 1.6. But how?\n\nAlternatively, each occurrence of a 3 or 2 in the row is replaced by 8, but in the output, they are merged into a single 8. But in Example0's first row, two numbers become one 8. In Example2's sixth row, three numbers become two 8s. So maybe the number of 8s is the number of pairs of 3 and 2. For example, in Example0's first row, one pair \u2192 one 8. Example2's sixth row has one pair (3,2) and one remaining 3. But why the remaining 3 becomes 8? So perhaps any 3 left after pairs are also turned into 8. But why? Or maybe the number of 8s is equal to the number of 3s and 2s, but that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is that whenever a 3 and 2 appear in the same row (regardless of adjacency), they are both converted to 8, and any other numbers are set to 0. But in Example1's fourth row, there's a 3 and a 2, so both are converted to 8, but the output has 8 and 2. That doesn't fit.\n\nWait, Example1's fourth row input is [0,3,0,0,0,2]. Output is [0,8,0,0,0,2]. So the 3 is replaced by 8, but the 2 remains as 2. Why?\n\nThis is perplexing. Maybe there's a different pattern. Let's consider the positions where the 8s appear in the output. For Example0's first row, the 8 is at position 0. In Example1's second row, the 8 is at position 2. In Example1's fourth row, the 8 is at position 1. In Example2's third row, the 8 is at position 3. In Example2's sixth row, two 8s: positions 0 and 5.\n\nLooking at the input positions where the 8s originated:\n\nExample0's first row: 3 and 2 in positions 0 and 1 \u21928 at 0.\n\nExample1's second row: 3 and 2 in positions 2 and 3 \u21928 at 2.\n\nExample2's third row: 2 and 3 in positions 2 and 3 \u21928 at 3.\n\nExample2's sixth row: 3 and 2 in positions 0 and 1 \u21928 at 0, and a 3 at position 5 \u21928 at 5.\n\nAh, perhaps the 8 is placed at the position of the 3 in each pair. So when there's a 3 followed by a 2, the 3 is replaced by 8, and the 2 is replaced by 0. Additionally, any lone 3s (not followed by a 2) are replaced by 8, but lone 2s are replaced by 0.\n\nLet's test this hypothesis.\n\nExample0's first row: 3 followed by 2 \u21923 becomes 8, 2 becomes 0. Other elements are 0. So output [8,0,0]. Correct.\n\nExample1's second row: 3 at position 2 followed by 2 \u21928 at position 2, 2 becomes 0. Other elements zero. So output [0,0,8,0,0,0]. But wait, the output for this row is [0,0,8,0,0,0]. Yes, that matches.\n\nExample2's third row input: [5,0,2,3,0,0,0]. The 2 is followed by 3 \u2192 so 2 is replaced by 0, and the 3 becomes 8. So the row becomes [5,0,0,8,0,0,0]. Correct.\n\nExample2's sixth row input: [3,2,0,0,0,3,0]. The first 3 is followed by 2 \u21928 at 0, 2 becomes 0. Then there's a 3 at position 5 followed by 0 \u2192 since no 2 after, but according to the hypothesis, lone 3s are replaced by 8. So output [8,0,0,0,0,8,0]. Which matches the example.\n\nExample1's fourth row input: [0,3,0,0,0,2]. The 3 is at position 1, followed by zeros. Then there's a 2 at position 5. So according to the hypothesis, the 3 is replaced by 8 (lone 3 \u21928), and the 2 is a lone 2 \u2192 replaced by 0. So output should be [0,8,0,0,0,0]. But the actual output is [0,8,0,0,0,2]. So this contradicts the hypothesis.\n\nWait, this is a problem. According to Example1's fourth row output, the 2 is left as is. So the hypothesis must be wrong. So what's different here? Let's look at that row.\n\nInput: [0,3,0,0,0,2]. Output: [0,8,0,0,0,2].\n\nSo the 3 is replaced by 8, but the 2 is left as 2. So why isn't the 2 turned into 0?\n\nHmm. Maybe the rule is that only 3s are replaced by 8, regardless of adjacency, and 2s are left as is unless they are part of a pair with a 3. But then, in Example1's fifth row, the 2 is replaced by 0.\n\nWait, in Example1's fifth row input: [0,2,0,0,0,0]. Output is [0,0,0,0,0,0]. So the lone 2 is replaced by 0. But in the fourth row, the lone 2 is left as 2. That's inconsistent. So there must be another factor here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2 in the fourth row is part of a pair with another 3 elsewhere in the matrix. But that's not the case. It's in the same row. Wait, in the fourth row input: [0,3,0,0,0,2]. So there's a 3 and a 2 in the same row, but not adjacent. So maybe any row that has at least one 3 and one 2 (regardless of position) has all 3s replaced by 8 and 2s left as is. But then, why in Example1's second row, the 2 is replaced by 0. No, that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule is that each 3 in the row is replaced by 8, and each 2 is replaced by 0 if there's a 3 in the same row. Otherwise, 2 remains. So in Example1's fourth row, there is a 3, so all 2s are replaced by 0. But the output shows the 2 remains. So that doesn't fit.\n\nThis is really tricky. Let me try to see if there's a different pattern, like looking at the entire matrix. For example, the sum of all 3s and 2s in the entire matrix is converted to 8s. But in Example0, there's 3+2+5=10. The output has 8+5=13. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's a diagonal thing. Looking at Example2's sixth row input: [3,2,0,0,0,3,0]. Output: [8,0,0,0,0,8,0]. The first 3 is replaced by 8, the 2 by 0, and the last 3 by 8. So two 8s. Maybe if a 3 is in a position that's part of a diagonal with a 2 elsewhere in the matrix, it's replaced by 8. But that seems complicated.\n\nAnother angle: Let's look at the Test Input and see if applying a certain rule gives a plausible output.\n\nTest Input:\n\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 5]\n[0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 2, 0]\n[0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 2]\n[5, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0]\n[5, 3, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 2, 0]\n\nLet's apply the hypothesis that in each row, every 3 followed by a 2 is replaced by 8 in the position of the 3, and every 3 not followed by a 2 is replaced by 8. 2s not preceded by a 3 are replaced by 0.\n\nSo let's process each row:\n\nRow 0: [0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,5]\nHas a 2 at position4. No 3 before it. So 2 becomes 0. 5 remains. Other zeros. So output would be [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5].\n\nRow1: [0,2,0,0,0,0,3,2,0]\nHas 2 at position1 (not after 3), 3 at position6 followed by 2 at7. So 3 is replaced by8, 2 becomes 0. So row becomes [0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,0].\n\nRow2: [0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n3 is followed by 0. So replaced by8. Output: [0,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0].\n\nRow3: [0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,2]\n5 remains. 2 at position8. No 3 in row. So 2 becomes 0. Output: [0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,0].\n\nRow4: [5,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0]\n2 at position3. No 3 in row. So 2 becomes 0. 5 remains. Output: [5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0].\n\nRow5: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0]\n3 at position7. Not followed by 2. Replaced by8. Output: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0].\n\nRow6: [5,3,0,0,0,5,0,2,0]\n3 at position1 followed by 0. So replaced by8. 2 at position7, not preceded by 3 in row (position7-1 is 0). So 2 becomes 0. Output: [5,8,0,0,0,5,0,0,0].\n\nBut according to the training examples, when a row has a 3 and a 2 not adjacent, sometimes they are both replaced. But in this hypothesis, row3's 2 is replaced by0, and row1's 2 is replaced by0 except when part of a pair.\n\nBut comparing to the training examples, this may not be correct.\n\nFor example, in Example1's fourth row: input [0,3,0,0,0,2], the 3 is replaced by8, and the 2 remains. According to the hypothesis, since there's no 3 preceding the 2, the 2 should be replaced by0. But the output has 2. So this contradicts.\n\nSo maybe there's another pattern. Perhaps the rule is to replace all 3s with 8, and all 2s with 8 if they are in the same row as a 3. Otherwise, 2s are zeroed.\n\nLet's test this:\n\nExample0's first row: 3 and 2 \u2192 replace 3 with8, and 2 with8 if in same row. But output has only one 8. So this doesn't fit.\n\nExample1's fourth row: 3 and 2 in same row. 3 becomes8, 2 becomes8. But output has 8 and 2. So no.\n\nThis is not working. Let's try to think of another approach.\n\nLooking at Example2's output in row 5:\n\nInput row: [3,2,0,0,0,3,0] \u2192 output [8,0,0,0,0,8,0].\n\nSo the 3 at position0 and 2 at1 become 8 at0. Then the 3 at position5 becomes8. Why? Maybe if there's a 3 anywhere in the row, it's replaced by8, and any 2 is replaced by0. But then, in Example1's fourth row, the 2 would be replaced by0. But in the output, it's left as2. So this can't be.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is that any 3 in the row is replaced by8, and any 2 that is followed by a3 is replaced by0, but others are left as is. But this also doesn't explain the examples.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's based on the sum of the row. For example, the sum of each row is replaced by 8 if the sum is 5. But Example0's first row sum is 5 \u21928. Example1's second row sum is 5 \u21928. Example2's third row sum is 2+3=5 \u21928. The sixth row sum is 3+2+3=8. But 8 is not 5. So that's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the sum of all pairs of 3 and 2 in the row. Each pair sums to 5 and is replaced by8. So in Example0's first row, one pair \u21928. Example2's sixth row, one pair (3+2) and one 3 \u2192 but the 3 is alone. So maybe that's another rule.\n\nThis is getting too time-consuming. Given the time constraints, perhaps the pattern is that in each row, every occurrence of a 3 followed by a 2 (adjacent) is replaced by an 8 in the position of the 3, and the 2 is set to0. Additionally, any 3 not followed by a 2 is replaced by8, and any 2 not preceded by a3 is set to0. Let's apply this to the test input and see if it makes sense.\n\nTest Input row by row:\n\nRow0: [0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,5]\n\n- 2 is not preceded by3 \u2192 set to0. 5 remains. So output: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5]\n\nRow1: [0,2,0,0,0,0,3,2,0]\n\n- 2 at1: not preceded by3 \u21920.\n- 3 at6: followed by2 \u21928 at6, 2 becomes0.\n- So row becomes [0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,0]\n\nRow2: [0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\n- 3 at1: not followed by2 \u2192 replaced by8.\n- Output: [0,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow3: [0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,2]\n\n- 5 remains. 2 at8: not preceded by3 \u21920.\n- Output: [0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow4: [5,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0]\n\n- 2 at3: not preceded by3 \u21920.\n- Output: [5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow5: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0]\n\n- 3 at7: not followed by2 \u2192 replaced by8.\n- Output: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0]\n\nRow6: [5,3,0,0,0,5,0,2,0]\n\n- 3 at1: followed by0 \u2192 replaced by8.\n- 2 at7: not preceded by3 \u21920.\n- Output: [5,8,0,0,0,5,0,0,0]\n\nPutting it all together, the output would be:\n\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5]\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0]\n[0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0]\n[5, 8, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0]\n\nBut wait, in Example1's fourth row, according to this rule, the 3 would be replaced by8 and the 2 set to0, but in the actual example, the 2 remains as2. So this rule doesn't fit that case. Hence, this must be incorrect.\n\nBut given the time, maybe this is the best approximation. Perhaps the pattern is that every 3 in the row is replaced by8, and every 2 is replaced by0. Except when a 2 is preceded by a3, then the pair becomes8. Let's try that.\n\nTest Input row1: [0,2,0,0,0,0,3,2,0]\n\n- The first 2 is not preceded by3 \u21920.\n- The 3 is at6 followed by2 at7 \u2192 replace with8 at6, 2 becomes0.\n- The rest are zeros.\n- So row becomes [0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,0]\n\nRow3: [0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,2] \u2192 2 is replaced by0.\n\nRow6: [5,3,0,0,0,5,0,2,0]\n\n- 3 is replaced by8. 2 is replaced by0.\n\nThis matches the previous output.\n\nBut in Example1's fourth row input [0,3,0,0,0,2], according to this rule, 3 becomes8, 2 becomes0. But the output is [0,8,0,0,0,2]. So why is the 2 not replaced? This suggests that the rule is different. \n\nMaybe the 2 is replaced by0 only if there's a 3 in the same row. But in Example1's fourth row, there's a3, so 2 should be replaced by0. But in the output, it's 2. This is conflicting.\n\nPerhaps there's a mistake in the training examples, but that's unlikely. Therefore, I must have missed the pattern.\n\nAnother idea: Maybe the rule is to replace each 3 with 8 and each 2 with 0, but only if they are not part of a 3-2 pair. Wait, but in Example0's first row, 3 and 2 are replaced by a single8, but other 2s and 3s are zeroed. If pairs are replaced by8 and others zeroed. So, for each row:\n\n- Find all pairs of 3 and 2 that are adjacent. Replace each such pair with an 8 in the position of the 3, and set the 2 to0.\n- Any remaining 3s or 2s are set to0.\n\nBut in Example1's fourth row, the 3 and 2 are not adjacent. So the 3 is set to0, and the 2 is set to0. But the output shows the 3 is replaced by8 and the 2 remains. So this doesn't fit.\n\nThis is really frustrating. Given the time I've spent and the need to provide an answer, I'll proceed with the hypothesis that each 3 followed by a 2 (adjacent) is replaced by8, and other 3s and 2s are set to0. And apply that to the test input.\n\nBut given that in Example1's fourth row, this doesn't fit, maybe there's a different approach. Like, replace each 3 and 2 in the row with8, and sum them to determine how many 8s. But this is speculative.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule is to replace each 3 and 2 with8 and sum them, but the positions are the sum of their indices. But this seems too vague.\n\nAfter struggling, I think the correct pattern is that in each row, every 3 is replaced by8, and every 2 is replaced by0. Except when a 3 and 2 are adjacent, in which case they are replaced by a single8 in the position of the 3, and the 2 is zeroed.\n\nApplying this to the test input:\n\nRow0: [0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,5] \u2192 2 becomes0, output [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5]\n\nRow1: [0,2,0,0,0,0,3,2,0] \u2192 2 \u21920, 3 becomes8, adjacent to 2 (position7) \u2192 8 at6, 2 becomes0. So row becomes [0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,0]\n\nRow2: [0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0] \u2192 3\u21928, output [0,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow3: [0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,2] \u2192 2\u21920, output [0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow4: [5,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0] \u2192 2\u21920, output [5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow5: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0] \u21923\u21928, output [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0]\n\nRow6: [5,3,0,0,0,5,0,2,0] \u21923\u21928, 2\u21920. Output [5,8,0,0,0,5,0,0,0]\n\nThis seems to align with the training examples except for Example1's fourth row. But perhaps that example's output is a mistake, or there's an exception. Given the time, I'll proceed with this pattern."
