        "cot_1": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. So we have these input lists and output lists. The inputs are three rows each with seven numbers, and the outputs are three rows each with three numbers. The challenge is to see how the input transforms into the output.\n\nLooking at Example 0's input and output:\n\nInput rows:\n[1, 0, 0, 5, 0, 1, 0]\n[0, 1, 0, 5, 1, 1, 1]\n[1, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0]\n\nOutput:\n[0, 0, 0]\n[0, 2, 0]\n[0, 0, 0]\n\nHmm. Let's compare the positions. The output is a 3x3 grid, so maybe each output row corresponds to the input row in some way. But how?\n\nWait, maybe the output is derived from the first, third, and fifth elements of each input row? Because the output is three elements, and the input has seven. Let me check.\n\nIn Example 0's first input row: [1, 0, 0, 5, 0, 1, 0]. Taking positions 0, 2, 4 (if we index from 0), those are 1,0,0. But the output for the first row is [0,0,0]. That doesn't match. So maybe not directly taking those elements.\n\nAnother thought: Maybe the 5 in the middle of each input row is a clue. Each input row has a 5 at index 3. So maybe the elements around the 5 are involved. Like, the elements before and after the 5. But how?\n\nLet's look at the first input row in Example 0: elements before 5 are [1,0,0], and after are [0,1,0]. But the output row is [0,0,0]. Not sure yet.\n\nWait, maybe the output is determined by some operation between the elements of the input rows. For example, maybe each output cell is a sum or difference of certain elements from the inputs.\n\nLooking at the output in Example 0, the middle cell is 2. How does that happen? Let's check the middle input rows. The middle input row is [0,1,0,5,1,1,1]. Maybe the middle element of the output is calculated from the middle row of the input. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output grid represents counts of certain patterns in the input rows. For instance, looking for pairs or something. Let's check the outputs.\n\nIn Example 0's output, the middle cell is 2. Let's see if in any of the input rows there are two 1s in certain positions. For example, the middle input row has 1s at positions 1,4,5,6. Not sure.\n\nWait, maybe the output is a 3x3 grid where each cell (i,j) corresponds to some relationship between the i-th input row and the j-th element in a specific position. Or perhaps each output cell is the sum of certain elements from the three input rows.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is constructed by considering each of the three input rows and combining their elements in some way. Let's take the first example's output:\n\nOutput for Example 0:\nRow 0: [0,0,0]\nRow 1: [0,2,0]\nRow 2: [0,0,0]\n\nSo only the middle element of the middle row is 2. Let's look at the input rows. The middle input row (row 1) is [0,1,0,5,1,1,1]. Maybe the 2 comes from the sum of the 1s in this row. But there are four 1s here. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe the output counts the number of times a certain pattern occurs in the three input rows. For example, each output cell corresponds to a position in the 3x3 grid, and the value is how many input rows have a 1 in the corresponding positions. But since the output has 3 rows and 3 columns, maybe it's related to the three input rows and their elements.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is a result of comparing each input row with the others. For example, for each position in the output, it checks how many times a certain condition is met across the three rows.\n\nAnother approach: Let's look at the output values. The possible values are 0, 2. In the first example, the middle cell is 2, others are 0. In the second example, the outputs have 2s in certain positions. So maybe 2 is the result when two conditions are met, and 0 otherwise.\n\nWait, let's take the first example's input. The middle output row is [0,2,0]. So maybe the middle cell of the output is 2 when the middle row of the input meets a certain condition.\n\nLooking at the middle input row in Example 0: [0,1,0,5,1,1,1]. Let's see the elements around 5. The elements before 5 (indices 0-2) are [0,1,0], and after (indices 4-6) are [1,1,1]. Maybe the sum of these parts. The sum before is 1, sum after is 3. But how does that lead to 2?\n\nAlternatively, maybe each output cell corresponds to the sum of the first, third, and fifth elements of each input row. Let's test this.\n\nIn Example 0's first input row: elements 0,2,4 are 1,0,0 \u2192 sum 1. But output row 0 is [0,0,0]. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAnother idea: The output is a 3x3 grid where each cell (i,j) represents the count of 1s in the j-th position across the i-th input rows. Wait, but each input has 7 elements, and the output is 3x3. Maybe not.\n\nWait, maybe the output is a 3x3 grid where each cell corresponds to a pair of elements from the input rows. For example, for each position in the output, we look at three rows and certain columns to compute the value.\n\nAlternatively, considering that each input row has 7 elements, maybe the 5 is a separator. So elements before the 5 (positions 0-2) and after (positions 4-6). Then, the output grid could be formed by comparing the sum or count of 1s in these parts across the three rows.\n\nFor example, the output's rows correspond to the input rows, and each column corresponds to left (before 5) or right (after 5) parts. Wait, but how would that form a 3x3 grid?\n\nAlternatively, maybe each output cell (i,j) is the sum of the left part (elements 0-2) of row i and the right part (elements 4-6) of row j. Let's test this with Example 0.\n\nRow 0 left: [1,0,0] sum is 1. Row 0 right: [0,1,0] sum is 1. So for output cell (0,0) it would be 1+1=2. But the output's first row is all zeros. So that's not matching.\n\nHmm. Maybe another approach. Let's look at the positions of 1s in the input and how they map to the output.\n\nIn Example 1's input:\n\nRow 0: [1,1,0,5,0,1,0]\nRow 1: [0,0,1,5,1,1,1]\nRow 2: [1,1,0,5,0,1,0]\n\nOutput:\n\n[0,2,0]\n[0,0,2]\n[0,2,0]\n\nThe output has 2s in certain positions. Let's see the middle row of the output has a 2 in the third position. Maybe the third column in the output corresponds to the right part of the input rows.\n\nWait, maybe each output cell is determined by the sum of the 1s in the corresponding positions across the three input rows, but in a specific way. For instance, each output cell (i,j) could be the count of 1s in the input's row i at positions j*2, j*2+1, and j*2+2. But since each input row has 7 elements, that's not straightforward. Let me check.\n\nWait, 3 columns in output. If j is 0, 1, 2. For j=0, positions 0,1,2 in input row. For j=1, positions 3 (but that's 5), maybe not. Alternatively, j=0: positions 0,2,4; j=1: positions 1,3,5; j=2: positions 4,5,6. Hmm, but that seems arbitrary.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking the elements before the 5 (positions 0-2) as the first part, the 5 in the middle, and after (positions 4-6) as the third part. Then, for each input row, we have three parts. The output might be the sum of 1s in each part across the rows. But how would that create a 3x3 grid?\n\nWait, if each input row is split into three parts: positions 0-2 (left), position 3 (the 5), and positions 4-6 (right). Then, each input row has left, middle, right parts. The output grid could be left vs right counts. For example, each cell (i,j) in the output could represent the number of 1s in the left part of row i and the right part of row j. Let's test this.\n\nIn Example 0:\n\nRow 0 left: [1,0,0] \u2192 sum 1.\nRow 0 right: [0,1,0] \u2192 sum 1.\nRow 1 left: [0,1,0] \u2192 sum 1.\nRow 1 right: [1,1,1] \u2192 sum 3.\nRow 2 left: [1,0,0] \u2192 sum 1.\nRow 2 right: [0,0,0] \u2192 sum 0.\n\nIf output cell (i,j) is sum of left of row i and right of row j:\n\nRow 0 (i=0) left is 1. For j=0 (row 0's right sum 1 \u2192 1+1=2?), but output cell (0,0) is 0. Doesn't match.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the product. Or perhaps the count of positions where left i and right j have 1s. For example, in row i's left and row j's right, count the positions where both have 1s. But since left is three elements and right is three, how?\n\nWait, maybe the output is the number of 1s in the left of row i and the right of row j, but compared element-wise. For example, for each position in left (3 elements) and right (3 elements), count how many times both are 1 in the same position. But since left is three elements, and right is three, maybe for each of the three positions, check if left[i][k] and right[j][k] are both 1, then sum across k.\n\nLet's try this for Example 0:\n\nRow 0 left: [1,0,0]\nRow 1 right: [1,1,1]\nFor output cell (0,1), which is the first row in output. Wait, the output rows are three, so maybe (i,j) corresponds to input row i and input row j. Let me check.\n\nIn Example 0's output, the middle row (i=1) is [0,2,0]. So j=1 here. So for (1,1), let's see:\n\nRow 1 left: [0,1,0]\nRow 1 right: [1,1,1]\nCompare each of the three positions in left and right. For each k from 0 to 2:\n\nLeft element at k and right element at k. If both are 1, count it.\n\nRow 1 left: elements 0,1,2 \u2192 0,1,0\nRow 1 right: elements 4,5,6 \u2192 1,1,1 (assuming right is 4-6, which are positions 4,5,6).\n\nWait, but how does comparing left and right of the same row lead to the output cell (1,1) being 2?\n\nIf left is [0,1,0] and right is [1,1,1], then comparing each position:\n\nPosition 0: left 0 vs right 4? That doesn't make sense. Maybe the right part is the elements after 5 (indices 4,5,6), which are [1,1,1] for row 1.\n\nSo, for output cell (i,j), take the left part of row i and the right part of row j. Then, compare each of the three elements in left and right. If both are 1, add 1. Sum all three positions.\n\nSo for cell (1,1):\n\nLeft of row 1 is [0,1,0]\nRight of row 1 is [1,1,1]\nCompare each position:\n\n0: 0 vs 1 \u2192 no.\n1: 1 vs 1 \u2192 yes. Count 1.\n2: 0 vs 1 \u2192 no.\nTotal 1. But the output cell (1,1) is 2. So this doesn't add up.\n\nHmm. Maybe there's another way. Let's try Example 1:\n\nInput for Example 1:\n\nRow0: [1,1,0,5,0,1,0] \u2192 left [1,1,0], right [0,1,0]\nRow1: [0,0,1,5,1,1,1] \u2192 left [0,0,1], right [1,1,1]\nRow2: [1,1,0,5,0,1,0] \u2192 same as row0.\n\nOutput:\n[0,2,0]\n[0,0,2]\n[0,2,0]\n\nTake cell (0,1) which is 2. So left of row0 and right of row1:\n\nRow0 left: [1,1,0]\nRow1 right: [1,1,1]\n\nCompare each position:\n\n1 vs 1 \u2192 yes \u2192 1\n1 vs 1 \u2192 yes \u2192 1\n0 vs 1 \u2192 no \u2192 0\nTotal 2. So cell (0,1) would be 2. That matches the output. Similarly, cell (1,2) is 2: left of row1 [0,0,1] and right of row2 [0,1,0]. Comparing each position:\n\n0 vs 0 \u2192 no (since left row1 is [0,0,1], right row2 is [0,1,0]. Wait, position 0: 0 vs 0 \u2192 no (since right of row2 is [0,1,0], which is elements 4,5,6 of the input row. Wait, in row2, input is [1,1,0,5,0,1,0], so right part is [0,1,0]. So left of row1 is [0,0,1], right of row2 is [0,1,0]. Comparing:\n\nPosition 0: 0 vs 0 \u2192 no (since 0 is not 1).\nPosition 1: 0 vs 1 \u2192 no (left is 0, right is 1).\nPosition 2: 1 vs 0 \u2192 no. So sum is 0. But in the output, cell (1,2) is 2. That's a problem. So this approach works for cell (0,1) but not for (1,2). Maybe my initial assumption is wrong.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is the sum of the 1s in the left part of row i and the right part of row j. For example, if left has two 1s and right has three, the sum is 5, but that's not possible here. So that doesn't fit.\n\nWait, looking at Example 1's output cell (1,2) is 2. Let's see: row1's left is [0,0,1], sum is 1. Row2's right is [0,1,0], sum is 1. 1+1=2. So maybe each output cell (i,j) is the sum of the left of row i and the right of row j.\n\nIn that case:\n\nExample 1's cell (0,1): left of row0 (sum 1+1+0=2) and right of row1 (sum 1+1+1=3). 2+3=5, which doesn't match the output of 2. So that's not right.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the product. 2 * 3 =6. No. Not matching.\n\nHmm. Let's think again.\n\nIn Example 0's output, the middle cell is 2. The input rows are:\n\nRow0: [1,0,0,5,0,1,0] \u2192 left [1,0,0], right [0,1,0]\nRow1: [0,1,0,5,1,1,1] \u2192 left [0,1,0], right [1,1,1]\nRow2: [1,0,0,5,0,0,0] \u2192 left [1,0,0], right [0,0,0]\n\nThe middle cell (1,1) in output is 2. So how does that come about? Let's consider that for cell (i,j) in output, we look at left of row i and right of row j, and count the number of positions where both are 1. So:\n\nFor cell (1,1), left row1 is [0,1,0], right row1 is [1,1,1]. So comparing each position:\n\n0 in left vs 1 in right \u2192 no\n1 vs 1 \u2192 yes (count 1)\n0 vs 1 \u2192 no\nTotal 1. But output is 2. So that's not matching.\n\nWait, maybe we are counting the number of 1s in the left of row i and the number of 1s in the right of row j, and adding them. For row1's left has 1 one (element 1), and row1's right has 3 ones. 1+3=4. Not 2. So no.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the minimum of the two sums. But 1 and 3 \u2192 min is 1. Not 2.\n\nAnother angle: Looking at the positions of the output. For Example 0, the only 2 is in the middle of the middle row. Let's look at the input rows:\n\nRow0 left: 1,0,0 \u2192 sum 1\nRow0 right: 0,1,0 \u2192 sum 1\nRow1 left: 0,1,0 \u2192 sum 1\nRow1 right: 1,1,1 \u2192 sum 3\nRow2 left: 1,0,0 \u2192 sum 1\nRow2 right: 0,0,0 \u2192 sum 0\n\nIf the output is a 3x3 grid where each cell (i,j) is the sum of row i's left and row j's right. So for (0,0): 1+1=2. But output is 0. So that's not it.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the count of 1s in row i's left and row j's right. But how?\n\nWait, maybe the output cell (i,j) is the sum of the 1s in row i's left and row j's right, but only if the middle element (index 3, which is 5) in row i and row j are the same. But in all examples, the middle element is 5 in all rows, so that's always true. So maybe it's just sum of left of i and right of j.\n\nBut Example 0's cell (1,1) would be left of row1 (sum 1) + right of row1 (sum3) =4, but output is 2. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, the sum of the left of row i and the right of row j, but multiplied by some factor. Not sure.\n\nWait, let's look at the outputs again. The outputs only have 0s and 2s. So perhaps the value 2 appears when exactly two pairs of 1s are found in certain positions. For example, in Example 1's output, cell (0,1) is 2. Let's check the corresponding left and right parts.\n\nRow0's left: [1,1,0] \u2192 positions 0 and 1 are 1s.\nRow1's right: [1,1,1] \u2192 all 1s.\nSo maybe the count is the number of overlapping 1s in corresponding positions. For example, for each of the three positions in left and right, if both are 1, add 1.\n\nSo for cell (0,1):\n\nLeft of row0 is [1,1,0]\nRight of row1 is [1,1,1]\nComparing each position:\n\n1 vs 1 \u2192 1\n1 vs 1 \u2192 1\n0 vs 1 \u2192 0\nTotal 2 \u2192 which matches the output cell (0,1) being 2.\n\nSimilarly, in Example 0's cell (1,1):\n\nLeft of row1: [0,1,0]\nRight of row1: [1,1,1]\nComparing:\n\n0 vs1 \u2192 no\n1 vs1 \u2192 yes (1)\n0 vs1 \u2192 no\nTotal 1 \u2192 but output is 2. So this doesn't match.\n\nWait, but in Example 0's output, the middle cell is 2. So according to this approach, it should be 1. So something's wrong.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the comparison is between the left of row i and the right of row j, but for all possible pairs of rows. Wait, maybe the output is a 3x3 grid where each cell (i,j) is the number of times a 1 appears in the left part of row i and the right part of row j at the same position. Let's try that.\n\nFor Example 0's cell (1,1):\n\nLeft of row1 is [0,1,0]\nRight of row1 is [1,1,1]\nCompare each position:\n\n0 vs1 \u2192 0\n1 vs1 \u2192 1\n0 vs1 \u2192 0\nTotal 1. But output is 2. So this doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. Maybe I'm missing something. Let's look at Example 2's input and output.\n\nInput for Example 2:\n\nRow0: [0,0,1,5,0,0,0] \u2192 left [0,0,1], right [0,0,0]\nRow1: [1,1,0,5,1,0,1] \u2192 left [1,1,0], right [1,0,1]\nRow2: [0,1,1,5,1,0,1] \u2192 left [0,1,1], right [1,0,1]\n\nOutput:\n\n[0, 0, 0]\n[2, 0, 0]\n[0, 0, 2]\n\nTake cell (1,0) which is 2. So left of row1 and right of row0.\n\nRow1 left: [1,1,0]\nRow0 right: [0,0,0]\nComparing each position:\n\n1 vs0 \u2192 no\n1 vs0 \u2192 no\n0 vs0 \u2192 no\nSum 0. But output is 2. So this approach is not working.\n\nAnother idea: Perhaps the output cell (i,j) is the sum of the 1s in the left part of row i and the right part of row j, but multiplied by 2 if the middle element (5) is present. But all rows have 5, so that's a constant.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the count of 1s in the entire row, but that doesn't fit. For example, in Example 0's row1 has four 1s. Output middle cell is 2. So 4/2=2. Not sure.\n\nWait, looking at the outputs again, the 2s are placed where certain conditions are met. Let's think of other possibilities.\n\nAnother approach: Each output cell (i,j) represents the sum of the first and last elements of the input rows. But not sure.\n\nWait, let's look at the input rows and see if there's a pattern in the positions. Each input row has seven elements, and the fourth element is 5. Maybe the output is related to the positions surrounding the 5. For example, positions 2 (before 5) and 4 (after 5). But how?\n\nAlternatively, the output could be the sum of elements at positions 0, 2, 4, and 6 for each row. But in Example 0's first input row, those are 1,0,0,0 \u2192 sum 1. Output row is [0,0,0]. So not matching.\n\nAnother thought: Maybe the output is a 3x3 grid where each cell is the product of the first three elements and the last three elements of a row. But not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the output could be determined by the parity (even or odd) of certain sums. For example, if the sum of some elements is even, output 0, else 2. But in Example 0's middle row sum is 4 (sum of left and right parts), which is even, but output is 2. So no.\n\nWait, let's think differently. The output has three rows and three columns, each cell being 0 or 2. Maybe each cell represents two 1s in certain positions. For example, each output cell (i,j) is 2 if in input row i, there's a 1 in position j*2 and j*2+1. But since there are seven elements, this might not fit.\n\nAlternatively, the output could be a count of the number of times 1 appears in the corresponding positions across all three input rows. For example, cell (0,0) in the output is the number of times input row 0 has 1 in position 0, input row 1 in position 0, and input row 2 in position 0. But that would require three elements, and the output is 0-2. Not sure.\n\nHmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's look for another pattern.\n\nWait, in Example 0's output, only the middle cell is 2. Looking at the input rows, the middle row (row1) has 1s at positions 1,4,5,6. The output cell is in the middle of the middle row.\n\nIn Example 1's output, the middle cell of row1 is 2. The input row1 has 1s in positions 2,4,5,6. Not sure.\n\nWait, maybe the output cell (i,j) is 2 if the input row i has a 1 in position j*2 and the input row j has a 1 in position j*2+1. Not sure.\n\nAnother angle: Each output row corresponds to an input row, and the three elements in the output row are counts of 1s in certain positions of the input row. For example, the first element of the output row could be the number of 1s in the first three positions of the input row, the second element could be the number of 1s in positions 4 and 5, and the third element the number of 1s in position 6. Let's check.\n\nExample 0's row0 input: [1,0,0,5,0,1,0]. First three: 1,0,0 \u2192 sum 1. Positions 4-5:0,1 \u2192 sum1. Position6:0 \u2192 sum0. So output would be [1,1,0], but the actual output is [0,0,0]. Doesn't match.\n\nAlternatively, the output row elements could be binary flags. If the count of 1s in certain positions is even, 0, else 2. Not sure.\n\nWait, maybe the output is based on pairs of 1s in the input rows. For example, each output cell (i,j) is 2 if there are exactly two 1s in certain positions across the three input rows. But how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is derived from the binary representation of certain parts of the input. For example, the left and right parts of each row form binary numbers, and the output is their sum. But with three bits, the max sum would be 3+3=6, but the output is 0 or 2. So unlikely.\n\nWait, another thought: The output might be the count of times a 1 appears in the same position across all three input rows. For example, output cell (0,0) is 2 if two of the input rows have a 1 in position 0. Let's check Example 0:\n\nInput rows:\n\nRow0: 1 in position0.\nRow1: 0 in position0.\nRow2:1 in position0.\nSo in position0, two 1s. So output cell (0,0) should be 2, but in Example0's output it's 0. So that's not it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output cell (i,j) is 2 if the sum of the j-th position in all three input rows is 2. For example, j could be 0, and if sum of row0[j], row1[j], row2[j] is 2. But in Example0's position0: 1,0,1 \u2192 sum 2. So output cell (0,0) would be 2. But the actual output is [0,0,0]. So that's not matching.\n\nHmm. This is challenging. Let's try to find another pattern.\n\nLooking at Example1's output:\n\n[0,2,0]\n[0,0,2]\n[0,2,0]\n\nThe 2s are in positions (0,1), (1,2), (2,1). So symmetrically around the diagonal. Maybe it's related to diagonal elements or something.\n\nAnother approach: Let's consider that each input row has a 5 in the middle. Maybe the 5 is a pivot, and the left and right parts are being compared. For example, each output cell represents the sum of matching 1s in the left and right parts of the corresponding rows.\n\nWait, perhaps each output cell (i,j) is 2 if the left part of row i and the right part of row j have exactly two 1s in the same positions.\n\nFor Example1's cell (0,1):\n\nRow0 left: [1,1,0]\nRow1 right: [1,1,1]\nComparing each position:\n1 vs1 \u2192 yes (1)\n1 vs1 \u2192 yes (1)\n0 vs1 \u2192 no\nTotal 2 \u2192 cell value 2. That matches.\n\nIn Example0's cell (1,1):\n\nRow1 left: [0,1,0]\nRow1 right: [1,1,1]\nComparing positions:\n0 vs1 \u2192 no\n1 vs1 \u2192 yes (1)\n0 vs1 \u2192 no\nTotal 1 \u2192 cell value 0. But output is 2. Doesn't match.\n\nHmm. So this works for Example1 but not Example0. What's different?\n\nWait, maybe the direction is flipped. For example, compare the right of row i and the left of row j. Let's try Example0's cell (1,1) as right of row1 and left of row1:\n\nRow1's right is [1,1,1], left is [0,1,0]. Comparing each position:\n\n1 vs0 \u2192 no\n1 vs1 \u2192 yes\n1 vs0 \u2192 no\nTotal 1. Still not 2.\n\nAlternatively, sum the 1s in left of row i and right of row j. If the sum is 2, then output 2. Otherwise 0.\n\nIn Example0's cell (1,1):\n\nRow1 left sum:1, row1 right sum:3. Total 4 \u2192 not 2. So no.\n\nExample1's cell (0,1): row0 left sum (2) + row1 right sum (3) \u21925. Not 2.\n\nSo that's not it.\n\nAnother idea: The output is 2 if the sum of the left and right parts of the corresponding rows is 2. For example, for cell (i,j), sum left of row i and right of row j. If sum is 2, output 2.\n\nExample0's cell (1,1): sum left row1 (1) + sum right row1 (3) =4 \u2192 not 2. Output is 2, so no.\n\nExample1's cell (0,1): sum left row0 (2) + sum right row1 (3)=5 \u2192 no. So no.\n\nThis isn't working. Let's try a different angle.\n\nLet me look at the test input and see if I can find a pattern from there.\n\nTest input:\n\n[1,0,1,5,1,0,1]\n[0,1,0,5,1,0,1]\n[1,0,1,5,0,1,0]\n\nWe need to apply the pattern to this.\n\nSuppose the pattern is that each output cell (i,j) is 2 if the number of 1s in the left part of row i and the right part of row j is exactly 2. For example, sum(left i) + sum(right j) =2.\n\nLet's see:\n\nRow0 left: [1,0,1] \u2192 sum 2.\nRow0 right: [1,0,1] \u2192 sum 2.\nRow1 left: [0,1,0] \u2192 sum 1.\nRow1 right: [1,0,1] \u2192 sum 2.\nRow2 left: [1,0,1] \u2192 sum 2.\nRow2 right: [0,1,0] \u2192 sum 1.\n\nNow, output cell (i,j) is 2 if sum(left i) + sum(right j) equals 2?\n\nFor cell (0,0): sum 2 (left0) + sum 2 (right0) \u21924 \u2192 no. Output 0.\nCell (0,1): sum 2 + sum2 (right1) \u21924 \u2192 no.\nCell (0,2): sum2 + sum1 (right2) \u21923 \u2192 no.\nCell (1,0): sum1 + sum2 \u21923 \u2192 no.\nCell (1,1): sum1 + sum2 \u21923 \u2192 no.\nCell (1,2): sum1 + sum1 \u21922 \u2192 output 2.\nCell (2,0): sum2 + sum2 \u21924 \u2192 no.\nCell (2,1): sum2 + sum2 \u21924 \u2192 no.\nCell (2,2): sum2 + sum1 \u21923 \u2192 no.\n\nSo only cell (1,2) would be 2, but this doesn't match the training examples. For example, in Example1, cell (0,1) is 2. sum(left0) is 2, sum(right1) is 3 \u2192 sum 5. So this hypothesis is incorrect.\n\nAlternative approach: Let's look for another pattern.\n\nIn Example0's output, the only 2 is in the center. Input rows: middle row has left sum 1, right sum 3. So 1+3=4. Not helpful.\n\nIn Example1's output, the 2s are in cells (0,1), (1,2), (2,1). These are positions where i and j are adjacent (like i=0,j=1; j=1,i=2; etc.). Not sure.\n\nWait, another idea: Each output cell (i,j) is 2 if there are exactly two 1s in the columns corresponding to i and j in the input rows. For example, column i and column j in the three rows. But the input has seven columns.\n\nAlternatively, the output cell (i,j) is the count of 1s in the input's column i and column j across all three rows. But how would that form a 3x3 grid.\n\nAlternatively, the output is a 3x3 grid where each cell represents the number of input rows that have 1s in both the left and right parts at the same position. For example, if in a row, the left part and right part have a 1 in the same position, count how many times this occurs across all three rows.\n\nBut for Example0's input, row1's left is [0,1,0] and right is [1,1,1]. The same positions are:\n\n0:0 vs1 \u2192 no\n1:1 vs1 \u2192 yes\n2:0 vs1 \u2192 no\nSo row1 contributes 1. The other rows contribute:\n\nRow0: left [1,0,0], right [0,1,0]. Only position 1 has left 0 and right1. So no matches.\nRow2: left [1,0,0], right [0,0,0]. No matches.\nTotal across all rows: 1. But output cell (1,1) is 2. So no.\n\nNot matching.\n\nAnother possible pattern: The output cell (i,j) is the number of input rows where the j-th element is 1 and the i-th element is also 1. For example, if looking at the first three elements of each row (since output is 3x3), but that's not clear.\n\nAlternatively, the output cell (i,j) is the number of times a 1 appears in the i-th position of the left part and the j-th position of the right part across all three input rows. For example, in Example0:\n\nLeft parts of all rows:\n\nRow0: [1,0,0]\nRow1: [0,1,0]\nRow2: [1,0,0]\n\nRight parts:\n\nRow0: [0,1,0]\nRow1: [1,1,1]\nRow2: [0,0,0]\n\nFor output cell (i,j), count how many rows have a 1 in the i-th position of their left part and a 1 in the j-th position of their right part.\n\nFor Example0:\n\nCell (0,0): left position0 has 1 in row0 and row2. Right position0 has 0 in row0,1 in row1,0 in row2. So for row0: 1 and 0 \u2192 no. Row1:0 and1 \u2192 no. Row2:1 and0 \u2192 no. Total 0. Output matches.\n\nCell (1,1): left position1 has 0 (row0),1 (row1),0 (row2). Right position1 has 1 (row0),1 (row1),0 (row2). So rows:\n\nRow0:0 and1 \u2192 no.\nRow1:1 and1 \u2192 yes.\nRow2:0 and0 \u2192 no.\nTotal 1. But output cell (1,1) is 2. So this doesn't fit.\n\nBut in Example1's output cell (0,1) is 2. Let's see:\n\nLeft part row0: [1,1,0], so left position0 is1. Right part row1: [1,1,1], right position1 is1. So for row0: yes (1 and1). Row1: left position0 is0 (row1's left is [0,0,1]), right part row1's right position1 is1. So 0 and1 \u2192 no. Row2's left position0 is1 (row2's left is [1,1,0]), right part row1's right position1 is1. So row2: yes. So total 2 (row0 and row2 contribute). So cell (0,1) would be 2, which matches the output.\n\nSo this seems to fit for Example1's cell (0,1).\n\nBut in Example0's cell (1,1), it should be 1 according to this pattern, but the output is 2. So why the discrepancy?\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake. Let's recheck Example0's cell (1,1):\n\nOutput cell (1,1) is 2. According to this pattern, it's the count of rows where left part's position1 is 1 and right part's position1 is1.\n\nExample0's input rows:\n\nRow0's left position1 is0, right position1 is1 \u2192 no.\nRow1's left position1 is1, right position1 is1 \u2192 yes.\nRow2's left position1 is0, right position1 is0 \u2192 no.\nSo total 1. But output is 2. So this doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. So this pattern works for Example1 but not Example0. But how?\n\nMaybe there's a mistake in my understanding. Let's look again.\n\nWait, perhaps the output cell (i,j) is the number of rows where the left part's position i is 1 and the right part's position j is 1. So for Example0's cell (1,1), i=1 and j=1.\n\nFor each row:\n\nRow0: left position1 is0 \u2192 no.\nRow1: left position1 is1, right position1 is1 \u2192 yes.\nRow2: left position1 is0 \u2192 no.\nSo count is 1. Output is 2. So this doesn't fit.\n\nBut in Example0's output, cell (1,1) is 2. So where does the 2 come from?\n\nAnother possibility: Maybe the output cell (i,j) is the sum of the left part's position i and the right part's position j for all three rows. For example, for each row, check if left[i] and right[j] are 1, then sum across all three rows.\n\nSo for Example0's cell (1,1):\n\nRow0: left[1] =0, right[1]=1 \u2192 0.\nRow1: left[1] =1, right[1]=1 \u21921.\nRow2: left[1]=0, right[1]=0 \u21920.\nTotal 1 \u2192 output is 2. Doesn't match.\n\nHmm. I'm stuck. Let's try to find another approach.\n\nAnother idea: The output is a 3x3 grid where each cell (i,j) is 2 if the input row i has a 1 at position j*2 and the input row j has a 1 at position j*2+1. For example:\n\nFor cell (0,0), check input row0's position0 (1) and input row0's position1 (0). Not sure.\n\nBut in Example0's output, cell (1,1) is 2. So check input row1's position2 (0) and input row1's position4 (1). Not sure.\n\nThis seems random.\n\nAnother possible pattern: The output cell (i,j) is 2 if there are exactly two 1s in the i-th and j-th positions across the three input rows. For example, in Example0's cell (1,1), check positions1 across all rows:\n\nRow0:0\nRow1:1\nRow2:0 \u2192 sum 1. No.\n\nAlternatively, positions 1 and 4 (since output is 3x3). Not sure.\n\nWait, looking at the input rows, maybe the output is a result of multiplying the first three elements of each row with the last three elements of the same row. But how to get 3 elements from that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is the product of the sum of the left part and the sum of the right part of each row. For Example0's row1: sum left=1, sum right=3 \u2192 product 3. But output is 2. No.\n\nAnother angle: The output may be related to the binary representation of the numbers formed by the left and right parts. For example, the left part is a 3-bit binary number, and the right part is another. Maybe the output is their difference or something. For Example0's row1 left is 0,1,0 (binary 010 \u2192 2), right is 1,1,1 (7). Difference 5. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, sum of left and right. 2+7=9. Output cell is 2. No.\n\nThis is really challenging. Maybe I need to look for a different kind of pattern.\n\nWait, let's look at the outputs again. In Example0, output is all zeros except middle cell which is 2. In Example1, output has 2s in positions (0,1), (1,2), (2,1). Example2's output has 2s in (1,0) and (2,2).\n\nObserving the positions:\n\nExample0: (1,1)\nExample1: (0,1), (1,2), (2,1)\nExample2: (1,0), (2,2)\n\nThese positions seem to form a diagonal pattern in Example1 and Example2. Maybe the output is a diagonal matrix when certain conditions are met.\n\nBut what determines which cells are 2?\n\nAlternatively, the output cell (i,j) is 2 if the left part of row i is the same as the right part of row j. For example, in Example0's cell (1,1):\n\nRow1's left part is [0,1,0], right part of row1 is [1,1,1]. They are not the same. So output is 0. But actual output is 2. Doesn't fit.\n\nAnother idea: Each output cell (i,j) is 2 if row i's left part and row j's right part have the same sum. Let's check:\n\nExample0's cell (1,1):\n\nRow1's left sum 1, row1's right sum3 \u2192 not equal. So no.\n\nExample1's cell (0,1):\n\nRow0's left sum2, row1's right sum3 \u2192 no. Output is 2, so no.\n\nNot helpful.\n\nAlternatively, the output cell is 2 if the sum of row i's left and row j's right is even. For Example0's cell (1,1):1+3=4 even \u2192 output 2. Yes! That fits. Let's check other cells.\n\nExample0's cell (1,1) sum 1+3=4 \u2192 even \u2192 2. Output is 2. Correct.\n\nExample1's cell (0,1): sum row0's left (2) + row1's right (3) =5 \u2192 odd \u21920. But output is 2. So no.\n\nHmm. Not matching.\n\nAnother possibility: Output is 2 if the sum of left of row i and right of row j is exactly 2. For Example0's cell (1,1):1+3=4 \u2192 no. Output is 2. So no.\n\nAlternatively, the product is 3 (1*3=3 \u2192 no). Not helpful.\n\nWait, perhaps the output cell (i,j) is 2 if the sum of the left of row i and the right of row j is even, and 0 otherwise. In Example0's cell (1,1): sum4 \u2192 even \u21922. Correct.\n\nExample1's cell (0,1): sum2+3=5 \u2192 odd \u21920. But output is 2. So no.\n\nNot matching.\n\nThis is really tough. Let's try to think differently.\n\nLooking at the Test Input:\n\nTest Input:\n\nRow0: [1,0,1,5,1,0,1] \u2192 left [1,0,1], right [1,0,1]\nRow1: [0,1,0,5,1,0,1] \u2192 left [0,1,0], right [1,0,1]\nRow2: [1,0,1,5,0,1,0] \u2192 left [1,0,1], right [0,1,0]\n\nWe need to generate a 3x3 output. If I can find the pattern, let's think of the possible output.\n\nIf the pattern is that each output cell (i,j) is the number of times the left part of row i and the right part of row j have 1s in the same positions. For example:\n\nRow0's left: [1,0,1]\nRow1's right: [1,0,1]\nComparing each position:\n\n1 vs1 \u2192 yes (1)\n0 vs0 \u2192 yes (1)\n1 vs1 \u2192 yes (1)\nTotal 3. So cell (0,1) would be 3. But outputs in training examples are 0 or 2. So this is unlikely.\n\nAnother angle: Perhaps the output is the count of rows where the left part has an even number of 1s and the right part has an odd number. But how this would form a 3x3 grid.\n\nAlternatively, the output cell (i,j) is 2 if the sum of the left part of row i and the right part of row j is exactly 2. Let's test this.\n\nFor Example0's cell (1,1):1+3=4 \u2192 no. Output is 2. No.\n\nExample1's cell (0,1):2+3=5 \u2192 no. Output is 2. No.\n\nNo match.\n\nI'm running out of ideas. Let's try to think of the output as a result of some bitwise operations. For example, XOR between left and right parts. But not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the output is a 3x3 grid where each cell (i,j) is 2 if the i-th input row's left part and the j-th input row's right part have exactly two 1s in total. For example:\n\nFor Example1's cell (0,1):\n\nRow0's left sum2, row1's right sum3 \u2192 total 5. Not 2. So no.\n\nNot helpful.\n\nMaybe the answer is that each output cell (i,j) is 2 if the left part of row i and the right part of row j have exactly two matching 1s in the same positions. For example, in Example1's cell (0,1):\n\nRow0 left: [1,1,0]\nRow1 right: [1,1,1]\nMatching 1s at positions 0 and 1 \u2192 total 2. So output is 2. That works.\n\nExample0's cell (1,1):\n\nRow1 left: [0,1,0]\nRow1 right: [1,1,1]\nMatching 1s at position 1 \u2192 total 1. Output is 2. Doesn't fit.\n\nBut the output is 2 for that cell. So this is a contradiction.\n\nWait, perhaps the sum is made by looking at the same row. For example, output cell (i,j) is the count of matching 1s between the left of row i and the right of row j. For Example0's cell (1,1), it's comparing row1's left and row1's right. Which has 1 matching 1. But output is 2. So this doesn't fit.\n\nI'm stuck. Given the time I've spent, perhaps I should look for a different pattern.\n\nAnother observation: All the outputs are symmetric around the center. For example, Example1's output has 2s at (0,1), (1,2), (2,1) which are symmetric. Example2's output has (1,0) and (2,2). Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the output is the number of 1s in the intersection of certain positions. Maybe the output cell (i,j) is 2 if the number of 1s in position i of the left part and position j of the right part across all three rows is 2.\n\nFor Example0's cell (1,1):\n\nRow0: left1=0, right1=1 \u2192 no.\nRow1: left1=1, right1=1 \u2192 yes.\nRow2: left1=0, right1=0 \u2192 no.\nTotal 1 \u2192 output 2. No.\n\nNot matching.\n\nAfter trying many approaches without success, I think the correct pattern is that each output cell (i,j) is the count of matching 1s between the left part of row i and the right part of row j. For each position in the left and right (three positions), if both are 1, add 1. \n\nIn Example0's cell (1,1):\n\nRow1 left: [0,1,0]\nRow1 right: [1,1,1]\nComparing each position:\n\n0 vs1 \u2192 no\n1 vs1 \u2192 yes (1)\n0 vs1 \u2192 no\nTotal 1. Output is 2. So this doesn't fit.\n\nBut in Example1's cell (0,1):\n\nRow0 left: [1,1,0]\nRow1 right: [1,1,1]\nComparing:\n\n1 vs1 \u2192 yes (1)\n1 vs1 \u2192 yes (1)\n0 vs1 \u2192 no\nTotal 2 \u2192 output 2. Correct.\n\nExample0's cell (1,1) should be 1, but output is 2. So this pattern only fits some examples.\n\nBut perhaps there's a mistake in my calculation. Wait, row1's right part in Example0 is [1,1,1], and row1's left is [0,1,0]. So for position 1, yes. But the output cell is 2. So where does the second count come from?\n\nAh! Maybe the output cell (i,j) is the sum of matching 1s between the left of row i and the right of row j across all three input rows. So for each row k in the input, compare the left of row k's i-th element with the right of row k's j-th element. Sum across all k.\n\nWait, that's a different approach. For output cell (i,j), for each input row k, check if the left part's i-th element is 1 and the right part's j-th element is 1. Sum over all three rows.\n\nLet's test this for Example0's cell (1,1):\n\nFor each row k (0,1,2):\n\nRow0: left i=1 (0), right j=1 (1) \u2192 0 and1 \u2192 no.\nRow1: left i=1 (1), right j=1 (1) \u2192 yes. Count 1.\nRow2: left i=1 (0), right j=1 (0) \u2192 0 and0 \u2192 no.\nTotal 1. Output is 2. So no.\n\nBut in Example1's cell (0,1):\n\nFor each row k:\n\nRow0: left i=0 (1), right j=1 (1) \u2192 yes. Count 1.\nRow1: left i=0 (0), right j=1 (1) \u2192 no.\nRow2: left i=0 (1), right j=1 (1) \u2192 yes. Count 2.\nTotal 2 \u2192 output 2. Correct.\n\nExample0's cell (1,1) would have sum 1, but output is 2. So this approach works for Example1 but not Example0.\n\nBut the output for Example0's cell (1,1) is 2. So why?\n\nUnless I'm misunderstanding the way rows are indexed. Maybe the output cell (i,j) corresponds to row i and row j, not the input rows.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output cell (i,j) is the number of input rows where the left part's i-th element is 1 and the right part's j-th element is 1. \n\nFor Example0's cell (1,1):\n\nCount how many input rows have left part's element1 ==1 and right part's element1 ==1.\n\nInput rows:\n\nRow0: left1=0, right1=1 \u2192 no.\nRow1: left1=1, right1=1 \u2192 yes.\nRow2: left1=0, right1=0 \u2192 no.\nTotal 1 \u2192 output 2. Doesn't fit.\n\nBut Example1's cell (0,1):\n\nCount rows where left0=1 and right1=1.\n\nRow0: left0=1, right1=1 \u2192 yes.\nRow1: left0=0, right1=1 \u2192 no.\nRow2: left0=1, right1=1 \u2192 yes.\nTotal 2 \u2192 output 2. Correct.\n\nExample0's cell (1,1) should be 1 according to this, but output is 2. So where's the mistake?\n\nMaybe the output cell (i,j) is the count of rows where left part's i-th element is 1 OR right part's j-th element is 1, but that would give higher numbers.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output cell (i,j) is the count of rows where left part's i-th element is 1 AND right part's j-th element is 1, multiplied by 2. \n\nFor Example0's cell (1,1):\n\nCount 1 \u2192 1*2=2. Which matches the output. Yes! \n\nExample1's cell (0,1):\n\nCount 2 \u2192 2*2=4. No. Output is 2. So no.\n\nWait, but in Example1's cell (0,1), the count is 2 (from rows0 and 2). So 2*1=2. So if it's multiplied by 1, it matches. But Example0's cell (1,1) is count 1*2=2. So this inconsistency.\n\nThis suggests that the output is twice the count of rows where left i and right j have 1s. For Example0, cell (1,1) is 1*2=2. Example1, cell (0,1) is 2*1=2. So this works.\n\nLet's verify other cells.\n\nExample0's cell (0,0):\n\nCount rows where left0=1 and right0=1.\n\nRow0: left0=1, right0=0 \u2192 no.\nRow1: left0=0, right0=1 \u2192 no.\nRow2: left0=1, right0=0 \u2192 no.\nCount 0 \u2192 0*2=0. Correct.\n\nExample0's output is all zeros except middle cell 2. Correct.\n\nExample1's cell (1,2):\n\nCount rows where left1=1 and right2=1.\n\nRow0: left1=1, right2=0 \u2192 no.\nRow1: left1=0, right2=1 \u2192 no.\nRow2: left1=1, right2=0 \u2192 no.\nCount 0 \u2192 output is 2. Doesn't match. But the output for Example1's cell (1,2) is 2. So this approach doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. This is conflicting. \n\nBut perhaps there's another layer: the output cell (i,j) is the number of rows where left i and right j are 1, plus the number of columns where left i and right j are 1. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output cell (i,j) is twice the number of rows where left i and right j are 1. \n\nIn Example0's cell (1,1), count 1 \u2192 2*1=2. Correct.\nIn Example1's cell (0,1), count 2 \u2192 2*2=4. Doesn't match output 2. So no.\n\nConfusion again.\n\nBut maybe the count is across all pairs of rows. For example, for cell (i,j), check all pairs of input rows (k,l) and count if row k's left i is 1 and row l's right j is 1. But how many pairs? For three rows, there are 9 pairs.\n\nFor Example0's cell (1,1):\n\nCheck all (k,l) pairs:\n\nk=0,l=0: left1=0, right1=1 \u2192 no.\nk=0,l=1: left1=0, right1=1 \u2192 no.\nk=0,l=2: left1=0, right1=0 \u2192 no.\nk=1,l=0: left1=1, right1=1 \u2192 yes.\nk=1,l=1: left1=1, right1=1 \u2192 yes.\nk=1,l=2: left1=1, right1=0 \u2192 no.\nk=2,l=0: left1=0, right1=1 \u2192 no.\nk=2,l=1: left1=0, right1=1 \u2192 no.\nk=2,l=2: left1=0, right1=0 \u2192 no.\n\nTotal 2. So output cell (1,1) is 2. Correct.\n\nExample1's cell (0,1):\n\nCheck all pairs (k,l) where left0 of row k is 1 and right1 of row l is 1.\n\nLeft0 of row0:1\nLeft0 of row1:0\nLeft0 of row2:1\n\nRight1 of row0:1 (row0's right is [0,1,0] \u2192 position1 is1)\nRight1 of row1:1 (row1's right is [1,1,1])\nRight1 of row2:1 (row2's right is [0,1,0] \u2192 position1 is1)\n\nSo pairs where left0 of k is 1 and right1 of l is1:\n\nk=0 and l=0: yes\nk=0 and l=1: yes\nk=0 and l=2: yes\nk=2 and l=0: yes\nk=2 and l=1: yes\nk=2 and l=2: yes\n\nTotal 6 pairs. But output cell (0,1) is 2. So no.\n\nThis doesn't fit.\n\nBut Example0's cell (1,1) is 2 using this approach. So perhaps the pattern is that output cell (i,j) is the number of pairs (k,l) where left i of row k and right j of row l are both 1, modulo some number. But 6 pairs would not give 2.\n\nThis is getting too complicated. Given the time I've spent and the patterns I've tried, I think the correct pattern is that each output cell (i,j) is twice the number of rows where the i-th left element and j-th right element are both 1. \n\nFor the Test Input:\n\nTest Input:\n\nRow0: [1,0,1,5,1,0,1] \u2192 left [1,0,1], right [1,0,1]\nRow1: [0,1,0,5,1,0,1] \u2192 left [0,1,0], right [1,0,1]\nRow2: [1,0,1,5,0,1,0] \u2192 left [1,0,1], right [0,1,0]\n\nFor each cell (i,j), count the number of rows where left[i] ==1 and right[j] ==1, then multiply by 2.\n\nLet's compute each cell:\n\nCell (0,0): rows where left0 is 1 and right0 is1.\n\nRow0: left0=1, right0=1 \u2192 yes.\nRow1: left0=0, right0=1 \u2192 no.\nRow2: left0=1, right0=0 \u2192 no.\nCount=1 \u2192 1*2=2.\n\nCell (0,1): left0=1 and right1=0 (row0's right1=0, row1's right1=0, row2's right1=1).\n\nRow0: 1 and0 \u2192 no.\nRow1:0 and0 \u2192 no.\nRow2:1 and1 \u2192 yes.\nCount=1 \u2192 2.\n\nCell (0,2): left0=1 and right2=1.\n\nRow0: 1 and1 \u2192 yes.\nRow1:0 and1 \u2192 no.\nRow2:1 and0 \u2192 no.\nCount=1 \u21922.\n\nSo cell (0,0)=2, (0,1)=2, (0,2)=2. But this would give a row of [2,2,2]. But looking at the training examples, this is not the case. For example, Example1's cell (0,0) is 0. So this approach is invalid.\n\nGiven that I can't find a pattern that fits all examples, I'll have to make an educated guess based on the examples provided.\n\nLooking at the Test Input:\n\nRow0 left: [1,0,1], right: [1,0,1]\nRow1 left: [0,1,0], right: [1,0,1]\nRow2 left: [1,0,1], right: [0,1,0]\n\nAssuming the pattern is that each output cell (i,j) is 2 if the number of rows where left i and right j are 1 is 1, and multiplied by 2.\n\nFor example:\n\nCell (0,0): Row0 left0=1 and right0=1 \u2192 count 1 \u2192 2.\n\nCell (0,1): Row0 left0=1 and right1=0 \u2192 no. Row1 left0=0 and right1=0 \u2192 no. Row2 left0=1 and right1=1 \u2192 yes. Count=1 \u21922.\n\nCell (0,2): Row0 left0=1 and right2=1 \u2192 yes. Others no. Count 1 \u21922.\n\nSo row0 would be [2,2,2]. But this is unlikely given training examples.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is the same as in Example1, where 2s are placed in a diagonal pattern. For the Test Input, the output might be:\n\n[2,0,0]\n[0,2,0]\n[0,0,2]\n\nBut this is a guess. Alternatively, considering the test input's rows:\n\nRow0's left and right are [1,0,1] and [1,0,1]. So for cell (0,0): left0=1 and right0=1 \u2192 count 1 (only row0). So 2.\n\nRow1's left [0,1,0] and right [1,0,1]. For cell (1,1): left1=1 (row1) and right1=0 \u2192 no. So 0. But perhaps other rows have left1=1. Row0: left1=0, row1:1, row2:0. So for cell (1,1), no. So output is 0.\n\nThis is getting too uncertain. Given the time I've spent, I think the correct answer is:\n\nFor the Test Input, the output is:\n\n[0, 2, 0]\n[2, 0, 0]\n[0, 0, 2]\n\nBut I'm not fully confident. Another possible output based on similar patterns:\n\n[0,0,2]\n[0,2,0]\n[2,0,0]\n\nAlternatively, looking at the examples, the pattern might involve comparing the left of the current row and the right of the next row. But without certainty, I'll proceed with an educated guess based on the training examples.",

        "cot_2": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. So, the input is a 3x7 matrix, and the output is a 3x3 matrix. I need to see how each input row transforms into the output rows. Let's look at the examples one by one.\n\nStarting with Example 0. The input rows are:\n\n[1, 0, 0, 5, 0, 1, 0]\n[0, 1, 0, 5, 1, 1, 1]\n[1, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0]\n\nOutput is three rows of [0,0,0], [0,2,0], [0,0,0]. Hmm. So maybe the middle element in the middle row is 2. Let me check the input rows. The middle input row's elements: the fifth element is 1, sixth is 1, seventh is 1. Wait, maybe there's a connection between the input's elements and the output numbers. \n\nLooking at the output values, they are 0 or 2. Maybe 2 appears based on certain conditions. Let's check other examples.\n\nExample 1's input:\n\n[1,1,0,5,0,1,0]\n[0,0,1,5,1,1,1]\n[1,1,0,5,0,1,0]\n\nOutput:\n[0,2,0]\n[0,0,2]\n[0,2,0]\n\nHere, the output has 2s in positions that might correspond to the input's first, third, or maybe other elements. Wait, the output seems to have 2s where certain elements in the input rows meet a condition. Let's see:\n\nIn the first input row of Example 1, the first two elements are 1 and 1. The output's first row middle element is 2. The middle row of output has a 2 in the third position. The middle input row here has elements 0,0,1,5,1,1,1. The third element is 1. Maybe the positions where the sum of certain elements equals something?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 5 in the fourth position of each input row is a clue. Since all input rows have a 5 in the fourth position, perhaps that's a separator. Let's consider splitting each row into parts before and after the 5.\n\nSo for each input row, the structure is [a, b, c, 5, d, e, f]. Then the output might be based on a combination of these parts.\n\nLooking at the output matrices. Each output row is of length 3. Since there are three input rows, maybe each output row corresponds to an input row. But how?\n\nWait, in Example 0, the output has a 2 in the middle of the middle row. Let's look at the middle input row: [0,1,0,5,1,1,1]. The elements after 5 are [1,1,1]. Maybe the sum of these is 3. But the output here is [0,2,0], with 2 in the middle. Maybe it's the count of 1s in the part after 5. But 1+1+1=3, but the output is 2. That doesn't add up.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is based on the number of 1s in the first three elements (before the 5) and the last three elements (after the 5). Let's check.\n\nIn Example 0's middle input row: before 5 is [0,1,0], sum 1. After 5 is [1,1,1], sum 3. But the output's middle element is 2. Not sure.\n\nWait, maybe the output is a 3x3 grid where each cell corresponds to a pair of elements from the input rows. For example, the first output row's first element might relate to the first input row's first element and the third input row's first element. Or maybe there's a connection between the columns across the three input rows.\n\nAnother approach: look for how each position in the output is determined by the input. Let's take the first example's output. The middle element of the middle row is 2. Let's look at the three input rows' middle positions (since the output is 3x3, maybe each output cell is determined by a combination of three elements from the input's three rows in certain positions).\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output matrix is generated by looking at each possible triplet of elements from the three input rows. For example, for each position j in 0-2 (since the output is 3 elements per row), check some condition across the three input rows at some positions related to j.\n\nWait, perhaps each element in the output matrix is determined by the sum of certain elements from the three input rows. Let's see.\n\nTake Example 0's output:\n\nRow 0: [0,0,0]\nRow 1: [0,2,0]\nRow 2: [0,0,0]\n\nThe 2 is in position (1,1). Maybe this is computed by looking at the 5th, 6th, or 7th elements of the input rows. Wait, in the input, the middle row has elements [0,1,0,5,1,1,1]. The elements after 5 are 1,1,1. The 2 in the output's middle might relate to the sum here. But 1+1+1=3, not 2. Hmm.\n\nLooking at Example 1's output:\n\nRow 0: [0,2,0]\nRow 1: [0,0,2]\nRow 2: [0,2,0]\n\nEach 2 is in positions (0,1), (1,2), (2,1). Let's check the input rows. The first input row has elements after 5 as 0,1,0. The middle input row has 1,1,1. The third input row has 0,1,0. Maybe the output is counting how many times a 1 appears in a certain position across the three rows. For example, in the first example's middle row after 5: 1,1,1. But the output is 2. Maybe it's the sum of specific positions.\n\nAlternatively, think of the input rows as three separate vectors, each split into two parts: the first three elements, then 5, then the last three. So each input row is split into [a, b, c] 5 [d, e, f]. Then perhaps the output matrix is a 3x3 where each cell (i,j) is determined by some operation between the a, b, c of row i and d, e, f of row j. But since there are three rows, maybe the output is a combination of all three.\n\nWait, but the output is three rows, each with three elements, making a 3x3 matrix. Let's imagine that each element in the output matrix is the product or sum of certain elements from the input rows.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is based on the number of 1s in specific positions across all three input rows. For example, the middle cell (1,1) in Example 0's output is 2. Let's check how many times 1 appears in the positions corresponding to the middle of each part. But I'm not sure.\n\nAnother approach: looking at the positions where the output is 2. Let's list all the output 2s and see their positions:\n\nExample 0: (1,1)\nExample 1: (0,1), (1,2), (2,1)\nExample 2: (1,0), (2,2)\n\nLooking at the input rows for these examples:\n\nTake Example 0's middle input row: [0,1,0,5,1,1,1]. The output cell (1,1) is 2. The elements after 5 in this row are [1,1,1]. The sum is 3. Maybe 2 is when there are two 1s in the same position across the three input rows' post-5 parts.\n\nWait, maybe for each output cell (i,j), we look at the j-th position in the post-5 part of each input row. Then count how many rows have a 1 in that position, but only if the corresponding pre-5 element is 1. Wait, that's a bit complicated.\n\nAlternatively, for each output cell (i,j), check the i-th input row's pre-5 elements and the j-th input row's post-5 elements. If there's some condition met between them, set the value to 2.\n\nWait, let's take Example 1's output:\n\nFirst output row is [0,2,0]. The cell (0,1) is 2. Let's see:\n\nLooking at input row 0's pre-5 (1,1,0) and input row 1's post-5 (1,1,1). Maybe the value is 2 if the sum of pre-5 elements in row i is equal to the sum of post-5 elements in row j? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output cell (i,j) is 2 if the sum of the pre-5 elements in row i and post-5 elements in row j equals a certain number.\n\nLet's try with Example 0. Output (1,1) is 2. Input row 1's pre-5: [0,1,0] sum 1. Input row 1's post-5: [1,1,1] sum 3. 1 +3 =4. Not sure. How about the product? 1*3=3. Not 2.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the number of 1s in the pre-5 of row i and the post-5 of row j. For Example 0's (1,1), pre-5 sum is 1 (row1), post-5 sum is 3 (row1). 1 +3=4. No. Maybe if they are equal? 1 vs 3. No. So not sure.\n\nLet me think differently. The output in Example 1 has three 2s. Let's check their positions. For (0,1), maybe row 0's pre-5 elements and row 1's post-5 elements. Row0 pre-5: [1,1,0] sum 2. Row1 post-5: [1,1,1] sum 3. 2 and 3. Not sure.\n\nAnother idea: the output matrix counts how many times the sum of the pre-5 elements in row i and the sum of the post-5 elements in row j is equal to 2. Wait, for Example 0, (1,1) is 2. Row1 pre-5 sum is 1, row1 post-5 sum is 3. 1+3=4, which is not 2. So that's not it.\n\nWait, maybe the output cell (i,j) is 2 if the sum of the pre-5 elements in row i is equal to the sum of the post-5 elements in row j. Let's check. Example 0's (1,1): row1 pre-5 sum 1, row1 post-5 sum 3. Not equal. So no.\n\nAlternatively, if the sum of pre-5 in row i and post-5 in row j equals a certain value. Let's see. In Example 1, (0,1) is 2. Row0 pre-5 sum is 2, row1 post-5 sum is 3. 2+3=5. Maybe 5? But the fourth element is 5 in all inputs. Not sure.\n\nHmm, maybe the 5 is a separator and we're supposed to pair the first three elements with the last three elements. For each row, if the first three elements match the last three in some way, then contribute to the output. But how?\n\nWait, in Example 0, the middle input row has [0,1,0] before 5 and [1,1,1] after. The output's middle cell is 2. Maybe 2 is the number of times a row has a 1 in the second position (since pre-5 has a 1 in index 1 here). Then, maybe the output counts the number of rows where the pre-5 at position j and post-5 at position k are 1. But I'm getting confused.\n\nAlternative approach: Let's look at the Test Input and see if applying a certain pattern gives the output, then check if it aligns with the training examples.\n\nTest Input:\n\n[1, 0, 1, 5, 1, 0, 1]\n[0, 1, 0, 5, 1, 0, 1]\n[1, 0, 1, 5, 0, 1, 0]\n\nEach row is split into [a,b,c,5,d,e,f].\n\nIf I consider the pre-5 parts as [a,b,c] and post-5 as [d,e,f], maybe the output is a matrix where each cell (i,j) is 2 if the sum of the i-th row's pre-5 and the j-th row's post-5 has a certain value. Let's see.\n\nFor example, in the Test Input:\n\nRow0 pre-5: [1,0,1], sum=2\nRow1 pre-5: [0,1,0], sum=1\nRow2 pre-5: [1,0,1], sum=2\n\nRow0 post-5: [1,0,1], sum=2\nRow1 post-5: [1,0,1], sum=2\nRow2 post-5: [0,1,0], sum=1\n\nNow, for each cell (i,j) in the output, maybe it's 2 if the sum of pre-5 of row i and post-5 of row j is equal to 3. Let's check:\n\nFor cell (0,0): 2 (pre) +2 (post) =4 \u2192 not 3 \u2192 0\n(0,1): 2 +2 =4 \u2192 0\n(0,2): 2 +1=3 \u2192 so 2 here.\nSimilarly, (1,0):1+2=3 \u2192 2\n(1,1):1+2=3 \u2192 2\n(1,2):1+1=2 \u21920\n(2,0):2+2=4 \u21920\n(2,1):2+2=4 \u21920\n(2,2):2+1=3 \u21922\n\nBut this would result in the output matrix:\n\n[0,0,2]\n[2,2,0]\n[0,0,2]\n\nBut this doesn't match any of the training examples. Wait, let's check the training examples.\n\nTake Example 1's output:\n\n[0,2,0]\n[0,0,2]\n[0,2,0]\n\nLooking at pre and post sums:\n\nRow0 pre: sum 2 (1+1+0)\nRow1 pre: sum 1 (0+0+1)\nRow2 pre: sum 2 (1+1+0)\n\nRow0 post: sum 0+1+0=1\nRow1 post: sum 1+1+1=3\nRow2 post: sum 0+1+0=1\n\nIf the condition is sum i's pre + sum j's post equals 3:\n\nFor cell (0,0): 2+1=3 \u2192 yes \u2192 2. But the output here is 0. So that contradicts.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the product of the pre and post sums. For cell (0,1) in Example 1, pre0 sum 2, post1 sum 3 \u2192 2*3=6. Not sure.\n\nAnother angle: maybe each output cell (i,j) is 2 if the number of 1s in the pre-5 of row i and post-5 of row j is exactly 2. Let's see.\n\nExample 0's middle row (1,1):\n\nRow1 pre has [0,1,0] \u2192 1 one. Row1 post has 3 ones. Sum 1+3=4. Not 2. So no.\n\nAlternatively, the number of positions where both the pre and post have 1s. For example, for each position in the pre and post across rows. Maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, for output cell (i,j), look at the j-th element in the post-5 part of the i-th input row, but that might not make sense since j can be up to 2 (since output is 3x3).\n\nWait, the post-5 part has 3 elements (positions 4,5,6 in the input row, since the 5 is at position 3). So for each input row, post-5 is [d,e,f] (indices 4-6). Maybe for each output row i, and column j, look at the j-th element in the post-5 part of the i-th input row. If that element is 1, then add something. But how does that create a 3x3 matrix?\n\nAlternatively, the output matrix could be a result of the interaction between the pre-5 and post-5 parts of all three rows. For example, for each of the three positions (0,1,2) in the pre-5 and the three positions in the post-5, count the number of times a 1 appears in the same position across all rows.\n\nWait, maybe each output cell (i,j) is the count of how many input rows have a 1 in the i-th position of their pre-5 and a 1 in the j-th position of their post-5. Let's test this with the examples.\n\nExample 0:\n\nInput rows' pre-5:\nRow0: [1,0,0]\nRow1: [0,1,0]\nRow2: [1,0,0]\n\nPost-5:\nRow0: [0,1,0]\nRow1: [1,1,1]\nRow2: [0,0,0]\n\nSo for output cell (i,j), count the number of rows where pre-5[i] is 1 and post-5[j] is 1.\n\nLet's compute this:\n\nFor i=0 (pre position 0):\n\nCheck which rows have pre[0]=1. Rows 0 and 2. For j=0 (post position 0):\n\nRow0's post[0]=0 \u2192 no.\nRow2's post[0]=0 \u2192 no.\nSo count 0 \u2192 output[0][0] =0.\n\nFor i=0, j=1:\n\nRow0's post[1]=1 \u2192 yes. So rows 0 and 2. How many have pre[0]=1 and post[1]=1.\n\nRow0: pre0=1, post1=1 \u2192 yes. So count 1.\nRow2: pre0=1, post1=0 \u2192 no.\nSo output[0][1] =1. But the actual output is 0. Hmm, this doesn't align. So this hypothesis is incorrect.\n\nAnother idea: Maybe the output is a 3x3 matrix where each cell (i,j) is 2 if exactly two of the input rows have a 1 in the i-th position of the pre-5 and a 1 in the j-th position of the post-5. Otherwise, 0.\n\nLet's check Example 1:\n\nInput rows:\n\nRow0 pre: [1,1,0], post: [0,1,0]\nRow1 pre: [0,0,1], post: [1,1,1]\nRow2 pre: [1,1,0], post: [0,1,0]\n\nFor cell (0,1) (i=0,j=1):\n\nCheck how many rows have pre[0] =1 and post[1]=1.\n\nRow0: pre0=1, post1=1 \u2192 yes.\nRow1: pre0=0 \u2192 no.\nRow2: pre0=1, post1=1 \u2192 yes.\nTotal 2 \u2192 so output[0][1] would be 2. Which matches Example 1's first row [0,2,0].\n\nSimilarly, cell (1,2):\n\nCheck rows where pre[1]=1 and post[2]=1.\n\nRow0: pre1=1, post2=0 \u2192 no.\nRow1: pre1=0 \u2192 no.\nRow2: pre1=1, post2=0 \u2192 no.\nCount 0 \u2192 output[1][2] is 0, but in Example1's output, the middle row is [0,0,2], so cell (1,2) is 2. Hmm, this doesn't fit.\n\nWait, maybe j is the index in post-5. Let's compute cell (1,2) again.\n\npre[1] is the second element in pre-5 (index 1), post[2] is the third element in post-5 (index 5).\n\nLooking at Example1:\n\nRow0: pre1=1, post2=0 \u2192 no.\nRow1: pre1=0 \u2192 no.\nRow2: pre1=1, post2=0 \u2192 no. So count is 0. But Example1's output has 2 in cell (1,2). So this idea is wrong.\n\nAlternative, perhaps the output cell (i,j) is 2 if the sum of the i-th pre elements across all three rows and j-th post elements across all three rows equals 2. Let's see.\n\nFor Example0:\n\npre0: row0=1, row1=0, row2=1 \u2192 sum 2.\npost0: row0=0, row1=1, row2=0 \u2192 sum 1.\n\nSo cell (0,0) would be 1 (sum of pre0 and post0: 2+1=3). No.\n\nNot helpful.\n\nAnother thought: The output matrix is a 3x3 where each cell is twice the number of times the corresponding pre and post positions are both 1 across all three rows.\n\nWait, in Example0's middle input row, pre-5 is [0,1,0], post-5 is [1,1,1]. So pre1 is 1, and post0, post1, post2 are 1. So for cell (1,0), (1,1), (1,2) in output, each would count this row's contribution. But how does that fit with the output?\n\nAlternatively, maybe each cell (i,j) is 2 if exactly two rows have a 1 in both their i-th pre and j-th post positions.\n\nIn Example0:\n\nLooking for cell (1,1):\n\nCheck rows where pre[1] is 1 and post[1] is 1.\n\nRow0: pre1=0 \u2192 no.\nRow1: pre1=1, post1=1 \u2192 yes.\nRow2: pre1=0 \u2192 no.\nOnly 1 row. So count 1 \u2192 output 0. But Example0's (1,1) is 2. So this doesn't fit.\n\nThis is tricky. Let's look at Example2's input and output.\n\nExample2 Input:\n\nRow0: [0,0,1,5,0,0,0]\nRow1: [1,1,0,5,1,0,1]\nRow2: [0,1,1,5,1,0,1]\n\nOutput:\n\n[0,0,0]\n[2,0,0]\n[0,0,2]\n\nLooking at output cell (1,0) is 2. Let's see how that could happen.\n\nIf the idea is that for cell (i,j), we look at the i-th row's pre and j-th row's post, and count if there's a certain condition.\n\nFor cell (1,0): i=1 (input row1), j=0 (input row0's post). \n\nInput row1's pre is [1,1,0]. Input row0's post is [0,0,0]. \n\nIf the sum of pre in row1 and post in row0 is 1+1+0 (sum 2) and 0+0+0 (sum 0). Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output cell (i,j) is 2 if the number of 1s in the pre of row i and the post of row j is exactly 2. For example, in Example2's cell (1,0):\n\nRow1's pre sum is 2 (1+1+0). Row0's post sum is 0. 2+0=2 \u2192 maybe that's the condition. So 2 in the cell. \n\nBut let's check other cells. For Example2's cell (2,2):\n\nRow2's pre sum is 2 (0+1+1), row2's post sum is 2 (1+0+1). 2+2=4. But output is 2 here. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, if it's the sum of the pre of row i and post of row j equals 2. For cell (1,0): row1 pre sum 2, row0 post sum 0 \u2192 2+0=2 \u2192 2. Which matches the output. For cell (2,2): row2 pre sum 2, row2 post sum 2 \u2192 sum 4 \u2192 0. But output is 2. So that's conflicting.\n\nHmm. Not sure.\n\nAlternative approach: Let's think about the output as a count of how many times, across the three input rows, the pre-5 element at position i and the post-5 element at position j are both 1. Then multiply that count by 2.\n\nLet's test this with Example1.\n\nExample1's input rows:\n\nRow0: pre [1,1,0], post [0,1,0]\nRow1: pre [0,0,1], post [1,1,1]\nRow2: pre [1,1,0], post [0,1,0]\n\nFor output cell (0,1) (i=0,j=1):\n\nCheck each row's pre0 and post1:\n\nRow0: pre0=1, post1=1 \u2192 count +=1.\nRow1: pre0=0 \u2192 no.\nRow2: pre0=1, post1=1 \u2192 count +=1.\nTotal count 2 \u2192 multiply by 2 \u2192 4? But output is 2. So no, that doesn't fit.\n\nWait, maybe the count is 1, multiply by 2. But 1*2=2. But in this case, two rows contribute. So maybe the count is directly the output.\n\nBut the output is 2 here. So maybe the count is 1, but that's not possible. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the output cell (i,j) is 2 if exactly two of the input rows have pre[i] and post[j] both 1.\n\nIn Example1's cell (0,1):\n\nRow0: pre0=1, post1=1 \u2192 yes.\nRow1: pre0=0 \u2192 no.\nRow2: pre0=1, post1=1 \u2192 yes.\nTotal 2 \u2192 so output is 2. Which matches. Similarly, cell (1,2):\n\nCheck pre1 and post2 in all rows.\n\nRow0: pre1=1, post2=0 \u2192 no.\nRow1: pre1=0, post2=1 \u2192 no.\nRow2: pre1=1, post2=0 \u2192 no.\nCount 0 \u2192 output 0. But in Example1's output, cell (1,2) is 2. So this doesn't fit.\n\nWait, but in Example1's output, cell (1,2) is 2. Let's check what rows have pre[1] and post[2] both 1.\n\nRow0: pre1=1, post2=0 \u2192 no.\nRow1: pre1=0 \u2192 no.\nRow2: pre1=1, post2=0 \u2192 no. So count 0. But output is 2. So this hypothesis is invalid.\n\nThis is getting frustrating. Maybe another angle: perhaps the output is determined by the XOR of certain elements. For example, in Example0's middle output cell, maybe the sum of the first and fifth elements across the three input rows. \n\nWait, the input rows in Example0:\n\nRow0: [1,0,0,5,0,1,0] \u2192 elements 0:1, 4:0, 5:1, 6:0\nRow1: [0,1,0,5,1,1,1] \u2192 elements 0:0, 4:1, 5:1, 6:1\nRow2: [1,0,0,5,0,0,0] \u2192 elements 0:1, 4:0, 5:0, 6:0\n\nThe output is [0,0,0], [0,2,0], [0,0,0]. The middle cell (1,1) is 2. Looking at the input's elements in position 4 (since 1,1 in output could correspond to position 4 of rows). Row0's element4 is 0, row1's is 1, row2's is 0. Sum is 1. Not 2.\n\nAlternatively, element5 (index5) of each input row. Row0:1, row1:1, row2:0. Sum is 2. Which matches the output's 2. So maybe the middle cell (1,1) is the sum of element5 of all three input rows. But Example0's output has 2 here. Sum of 1+1+0=2. So yes. But how does this generalize?\n\nLet's check Example1's output, which has cell (0,1) as 2. What's the sum of element5 in all rows? Row0:1, row1:1, row2:1. Sum 3. But the cell is 2, not 3. So that doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. Maybe each output cell corresponds to a different element. For example, output cell (i,j) corresponds to the j-th element of the i-th input row's post-5 part multiplied by 2. Let's see:\n\nIn Example0's middle output row: [0,2,0]. The middle input row's post-5 is [1,1,1]. If multiplied by 2, but that would give 2,2,2, but output is 0,2,0. So maybe only the middle element of post-5 is taken. Row1's post-5 middle element (index5) is 1. 1*2=2. That matches. Then row0's post-5 middle element is 1 (index5) \u2192 2, but output row0 is [0,0,0]. So this doesn't hold.\n\nAlternatively, for each output row i, the middle element is the sum of the post-5 elements of input row i. For Example0's middle row, sum is 3 \u2192 output is 2. Not matching.\n\nThis is really challenging. Let's try to find a pattern between input and output dimensions. Input is 3 rows, 7 elements each. Output is 3x3. Maybe each output cell corresponds to a pair of input rows, comparing their elements.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps the output is a 3x3 matrix where each cell (i,j) is 2 if the number of 1s in the j-th positions of the post-5 parts of all input rows is equal to i. Wait, that's a stretch. Let's check Example0's output. Middle cell (1,1) is 2. The post-5 parts of the input rows for position1 (element5) are 1,1,0. Sum is 2. So i=1, sum=2. Not matching.\n\nAlternatively, output cell (i,j) is 2 if exactly two input rows have a 1 in their j-th post-5 element and the i-th pre-5 element. Let's test this:\n\nExample0's cell (1,1):\n\nCheck how many rows have pre-5[1]=1 and post-5[1]=1.\n\nRow0: pre1=0 \u2192 no.\nRow1: pre1=1, post1=1 \u2192 yes.\nRow2: pre1=0 \u2192 no.\nCount is 1. So output should be 0. But Example0's cell is 2. So no.\n\nAnother approach: Let's think of the output as a kind of matrix multiplication between the pre-5 and post-5 parts. But since pre-5 is 3 elements and post-5 is 3 elements, perhaps each row's pre-5 is a vector and the post-5 is another vector, and the output is a sum of outer products.\n\nFor example, for each input row, compute the outer product of pre-5 and post-5 vectors (3x1 and 1x3), resulting in a 3x3 matrix. Sum these across all three input rows, then multiply by 2 if certain conditions.\n\nIn Example0:\n\nRow0's pre-5: [1,0,0], post-5: [0,1,0]. Outer product:\n\n[1*0, 1*1, 1*0]\n[0*0, 0*1, 0*0]\n[0*0, 0*1, 0*0]\n= \n[0,1,0]\n[0,0,0]\n[0,0,0]\n\nRow1's pre: [0,1,0], post: [1,1,1]. Outer product:\n\n[0*1, 0*1, 0*1]\n[1*1, 1*1, 1*1]\n[0*1, 0*1, 0*1]\n= \n[0,0,0]\n[1,1,1]\n[0,0,0]\n\nRow2's pre: [1,0,0], post: [0,0,0]. Outer product all zeros.\n\nSumming these:\n\nRow0 contribution: [0,1,0]\nRow1 contribution: [0,0,0] (no, wait, row1's outer product is middle row [1,1,1])\nRow2: all zeros.\n\nTotal sum:\n\n[0,1,0]\n[1,1,1]\n[0,0,0]\n\nMultiply by 2 where sum is 1? But Example0's output is:\n\n[0,0,0]\n[0,2,0]\n[0,0,0]\n\nHmm, not matching. But if we count the number of times each cell is non-zero and multiply by 2, maybe. For example, in the summed matrix:\n\nCell (0,1) has 1 occurrence \u2192 2.\nCell (1,0) has 1 \u2192 2.\nCell (1,1) has 1 \u2192 2.\nCell (1,2) has 1 \u21922.\n\nBut the output for Example0 has only cell (1,1) as 2. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAnother idea: Maybe the output is 2 in cells where exactly two of the input rows have a 1 in the corresponding pre and post positions. For example, cell (i,j) is 2 if exactly two rows have pre[i] =1 and post[j] =1.\n\nTesting this with Example1:\n\nLooking at cell (0,1) in output. Check how many rows have pre[0]=1 and post[1]=1.\n\nRow0: pre0=1, post1=1 \u2192 yes.\nRow1: pre0=0 \u2192 no.\nRow2: pre0=1, post1=1 \u2192 yes.\nTotal 2 \u2192 cell is 2. Which matches. \n\nCell (1,2) in Example1's output is 2. Check rows with pre[1]=1 and post[2]=1.\n\nRow0: pre1=1, post2=0 \u2192 no.\nRow1: pre1=0 \u2192 no.\nRow2: pre1=1, post2=0 \u2192 no. Count 0 \u2192 output is 2. Doesn't match.\n\nThis is conflicting. So maybe the pattern is not this.\n\nBack to the Test Input. Let's try applying the hypothesis where each cell (i,j) is 2 if exactly two input rows have pre[i] and post[j] as 1.\n\nTest Input rows:\n\nRow0: pre [1,0,1], post [1,0,1]\nRow1: pre [0,1,0], post [1,0,1]\nRow2: pre [1,0,1], post [0,1,0]\n\nFor each cell (i,j), count the number of rows where pre[i] and post[j] are 1.\n\nFor cell (0,0):\n\nCheck pre0 and post0 in all rows.\n\nRow0: 1 and 1 \u2192 yes.\nRow1:0 and1 \u2192 no.\nRow2:1 and0 \u2192 no.\nCount=1 \u2192 0.\n\nCell (0,1):\n\npre0=1 and post1=0 \u2192 Row0: yes pre0=1, post1=0 \u2192 no.\nRow1: pre0=0 \u2192 no.\nRow2: pre0=1, post1=1 \u2192 yes.\nWait, Row2's post1 is 1 (from post5 elements [0,1,0], so post1 is 1 (element5 of input row2 is 0, element6 is 0. Wait, no. The post-5 elements for row2 are [0,1,0], so post0 is 0, post1 is1, post2 is0. \n\nSo cell (0,1) is pre0=1 and post1=1.\n\nRow0: pre0=1, post1=0 \u2192 no.\nRow1: pre0=0 \u2192 no.\nRow2: pre0=1, post1=1 \u2192 yes.\nCount=1 \u2192 output 0.\n\nCell (0,2): pre0=1 and post2=1.\n\nRow0: post2=1 \u2192 yes. So count=1 \u2192 0.\n\nCell (1,0): pre1=0,1,0 across rows. post0=1,1,0.\n\nRows where pre1 is 1 and post0 is 1:\n\nRow1: pre1=1, post0=1 \u2192 yes.\nOthers: no. Count=1 \u2192 output 0.\n\nCell (1,1): pre1=0,1,0 \u2192 looking for pre1=1. Only row1. post1=0,0,1.\n\nRow1: pre1=1, post1=0 \u2192 no. So count 0 \u2192 output 0.\n\nCell (1,2): pre1=1 and post2=1.\n\nRow0: pre1=0 \u2192 no.\nRow1: pre1=1, post2=1 \u2192 yes.\nRow2: pre1=0 \u2192 no. Count=1 \u2192 output 0.\n\nCell (2,0): pre2=1,0,1. post0=1,1,0.\n\nRows where pre2=1 and post0=1:\n\nRow0: pre2=1, post0=1 \u2192 yes.\nRow2: pre2=1, post0=0 \u2192 no.\nCount=1 \u2192 output 0.\n\nCell (2,1): pre2=1 and post1=0,0,1.\n\nRow0: pre2=1, post1=0 \u2192 no.\nRow1: pre2=0 \u2192 no.\nRow2: pre2=1, post1=1 \u2192 yes.\nCount=1 \u2192 output 0.\n\nCell (2,2): pre2=1 and post2=1.\n\nRow0: pre2=1, post2=1 \u2192 yes.\nRow1: pre2=0 \u2192 no.\nRow2: pre2=1, post2=0 \u2192 no.\nCount=1 \u2192 output 0.\n\nSo according to this, all cells would be 0, which doesn't make sense. But the test input's expected output likely has some 2s. Clearly, this hypothesis is incorrect.\n\nAt this point, I'm stuck. Let me try to think of another approach. Maybe the output is based on the number of times a certain pattern occurs in the input rows. For example, each output cell corresponds to a position in a 3x3 grid where the value is 2 if two of the input rows have a 1 in certain positions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is the sum of certain pairs of elements. For example, each output cell is the sum of the first and fifth elements of the corresponding input row. But how does that fit into the examples.\n\nWait, in Example0's middle output cell (1,1) is 2. The middle input row's first element is 0, fifth is 1. Sum is 1. But output is 2. So maybe it's (first + fifth) * 2. 1*2=2. Which fits. Let's check other cells.\n\nExample0's first output row: [0,0,0]. The first input row's first element is 1, fifth is 0. Sum is 1. Multiply by 2 is 2, but output is 0. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAnother idea: the sum of the first and fifth elements, and if it's 1, multiply by 2. If the sum is 1, output 2; else 0. For Example0's middle row: sum 0+1=1 \u2192 output 2. Other rows may have sums 1+0=1 (row0), 1+0=1 (row2), which would mean their output cells are 2. But in Example0's output, only the middle cell is 2, others are 0. So this isn't correct.\n\nAlternatively, the sum of the first, fifth, and sixth elements. For Example0's middle row: 0 (first) +1 (fifth) +1 (sixth) =2. Output is 2. This works for the middle cell. For row0: 1+0+1=2 \u2192 output cell would be 2, but the output is 0. So no.\n\nHmm. Maybe the output is the sum of the fifth, sixth, and seventh elements multiplied by 2. For Example0's middle row: 1+1+1=3 \u2192 3*2=6, not 2. No.\n\nAlternatively, the number of 1s in the fifth, sixth, and seventh elements multiplied by 2. Middle row of Example0 has 3 ones \u2192 3*2=6. No.\n\nThis is not working. I think I'm missing something obvious. Let me look back at the examples.\n\nAnother observation: In all training examples, the output matrices have 2s positioned such that they form a certain symmetry. For example, Example1's output is symmetric with 2s in positions (0,1), (1,2), and (2,1), forming a sort of diagonal. Example2's output has 2s in (1,0) and (2,2). Example0's is a single 2 in the center.\n\nLooking at the input rows, perhaps the 2s in the output are determined by the positions where the sum of the pre-5 elements equals the sum of the post-5 elements for the corresponding row. For example, in Example0's middle row: pre-sum 1, post-sum 3. Not equal. But output is 2. So that's not.\n\nAlternatively, if the sum of the pre and post for a row is the same, then the output for that row's position is 2. But in Example0's middle row, sum pre=1, post=3. Not equal. Output has 2 in the middle. So no.\n\nWait, perhaps the output is the sum of the pre-5 elements multiplied by the sum of the post-5 elements for each row. Example0's middle row: 1*3=3. Output is 2. Doesn't fit.\n\nAnother angle: The output matrix's rows correspond to the three input rows, and each output row's elements correspond to the three post-5 elements of that input row multiplied by 2 if certain conditions in the pre-5 are met.\n\nFor example, if the pre-5 sum is even, multiply the post-5 elements by 2.\n\nExample0's middle input row: pre-sum 1 (odd). So no multiplication. Post elements [1,1,1] \u2192 output [1,1,1], but actual output is [0,2,0]. Doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, if the pre-5 has an even number of 1s, multiply the post-5 by 2. Example0's middle row: pre-sum 1 \u2192 odd. So post elements remain as 1s. But output has 2 in the middle. So that's not it.\n\nThis is really challenging. Maybe I should look for another pattern. For instance, the output could be a count of pairs of 1s in specific positions across the three input rows.\n\nWait, the Test Input's rows are:\n\nRow0: [1,0,1,5,1,0,1]\nRow1: [0,1,0,5,1,0,1]\nRow2: [1,0,1,5,0,1,0]\n\nPre-5 parts:\n\nRow0: [1,0,1]\nRow1: [0,1,0]\nRow2: [1,0,1]\n\nPost-5 parts:\n\nRow0: [1,0,1]\nRow1: [1,0,1]\nRow2: [0,1,0]\n\nLet me try applying the hypothesis where each output cell (i,j) is 2 if exactly two of the three input rows have a 1 in the i-th pre-5 position and a 1 in the j-th post-5 position.\n\nTesting for Test Input:\n\nFor cell (0,0):\n\nCheck how many rows have pre0=1 and post0=1.\n\nRow0: pre0=1, post0=1 \u2192 yes.\nRow1: pre0=0 \u2192 no.\nRow2: pre0=1, post0=0 \u2192 no.\nCount=1 \u2192 0.\n\nCell (0,1): pre0=1 and post1=0.\n\nRow0: post1=0 \u2192 yes. Count=1 \u2192 0.\n\nCell (0,2): pre0=1 and post2=1.\n\nRow0: post2=1 \u2192 yes. Count=1 \u21920.\n\nCell (1,0): pre1=0 and post0=1.\n\nRow0: pre1=0 \u2192 no.\nRow1: pre1=1, post0=1 \u2192 yes.\nRow2: pre1=0 \u2192 no.\nCount=1 \u21920.\n\nCell (1,1): pre1=0,1,0; post1=0,0,1.\n\nRows where pre1=1 and post1=0:\n\nRow1: pre1=1, post1=0 \u2192 yes. Count=1 \u21920.\n\nCell (1,2): pre1=1 and post2=1.\n\nRow1: pre1=1, post2=1 \u2192 yes. Count=1 \u21920.\n\nCell (2,0): pre2=1 and post0=1.\n\nRow0: pre2=1, post0=1 \u2192 yes.\nRow1: pre2=0 \u2192 no.\nRow2: pre2=1, post0=0 \u2192 no.\nCount=1 \u21920.\n\nCell (2,1): pre2=1 and post1=0,0,1.\n\nRow0: pre2=1, post1=0 \u2192 yes.\nRow2: pre2=1, post1=1 \u2192 yes.\nCount=2 \u2192 output 2 here.\n\nCell (2,2): pre2=1 and post2=1.\n\nRow0: post2=1 \u2192 yes.\nRow1: post2=1 \u2192 yes.\nRow2: post2=0 \u2192 no.\nCount=2 \u2192 output 2 here.\n\nSo according to this, Test Input's output would have 2s in cells (2,1) and (2,2). But what's the output structure? Let's see:\n\nThe output would be:\n\n[0, 0, 0]\n[0, 0, 0]\n[0, 2, 2]\n\nBut looking at the training examples, the outputs are symmetric in a way. Maybe not. Example1's output is symmetric around the center. Example2's output has 2s at (1,0) and (2,2). So perhaps for the Test Input, the output is:\n\n[0, 0, 0]\n[0, 0, 0]\n[0, 2, 2]\n\nBut I need to check if this matches the training examples.\n\nLooking back at Example1's input and output:\n\nOutput:\n\n[0,2,0]\n[0,0,2]\n[0,2,0]\n\nAccording to the hypothesis, cell (0,1) should be 2. Let's check:\n\npre0 of rows 0,1,2 are 1,0,1. post1 of rows are 1,1,1. How many rows have pre0=1 and post1=1.\n\nRow0: yes.\nRow2: yes.\nSo count 2 \u2192 cell (0,1) is 2, which matches.\n\nCell (1,2) is 2 in the output. Check pre1 and post2:\n\npre1 of rows 0,1,2: 1,0,1. post2: 0,1,0. Looking for rows with pre1=1 and post2=1.\n\nRow1 has post2=1 but pre1=0. So no rows. Count 0 \u2192 output should be 0. But in Example1's output, cell (1,2) is 2. So this hypothesis is incorrect.\n\nHmm. Back to square one. Maybe the answer is that the output matrix is formed by taking the last three elements of each input row, and replacing 1s with 2s. But in Example0's middle row, post-5 is [1,1,1], which would become [2,2,2], but the output is [0,2,0]. So that's not it.\n\nAnother idea: The output is a 3x3 matrix where each cell (i,j) is 2 if the i-th input row's j-th element after the 5 is 1. Otherwise, 0. \n\nFor Example0's middle row, post-5 is [1,1,1], so output would be [2,2,2]. But the actual output is [0,2,0]. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, only the middle element of the post-5 is taken. For Example0's middle row, post-5's middle is 1 \u2192 output [0,2,0]. But other rows in Example0's output are [0,0,0], which would mean their post-5 middle elements are 0. Which they are. \n\nBut for Example1's first input row, post-5 middle is 1 \u2192 output row0 is [0,2,0]. Which matches. Middle input row's post-5 middle is 1 \u2192 output row1 is [0,0,2]. Wait, but row1's post-5 middle is 1, so why is the output row1 [0,0,2]? That doesn't fit.\n\nThis is really tough. I think I'm missing something obvious. Let's try to look for a pattern in the positions of the 2s in the output.\n\nIn Example0: only the center cell is 2.\n\nIn Example1: cells (0,1), (1,2), (2,1) are 2.\n\nIn Example2: cells (1,0), (2,2) are 2.\n\nThese positions seem to be in a diagonal pattern. For Example1, it's like a diagonal from (0,1) to (2,1) and (1,2). Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the 2s are placed in positions where the sum of the row and column indices equals a certain number. For Example0, (1,1) sum 2. Example1's positions sum to 1 (0+1), 3 (1+2), and 3 (2+1). Example2's positions sum 1 (1+0) and 4 (2+2). Doesn't make sense.\n\nAnother observation: In the Test Input's post-5 parts, the rows are:\n\nRow0: [1,0,1]\nRow1: [1,0,1]\nRow2: [0,1,0]\n\nIf the output is formed by taking each row's post-5 part and replacing 1 with 2, then the output would be:\n\nRow0: [2,0,2]\nRow1: [2,0,2]\nRow2: [0,2,0]\n\nBut this doesn't match any training example's structure. For example, Example0's middle row post-5 is [1,1,1], which would become [2,2,2], but the output is [0,2,0]. So this is not the case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the post-5 part of the middle row only. Example0's middle row post-5 is [1,1,1], output is [0,2,0]. Doesn't match.\n\nMaybe the output is generated by some kind of adjacency or neighbor counting. For example, each output cell counts the number of 1s in adjacent cells in the input. But with the input being three rows of seven elements, it's unclear how this would map to a 3x3 output.\n\nAt this point, I'm going to have to make an educated guess based on the patterns I can see. The most plausible hypothesis I can come up with is that each output cell (i,j) is 2 if exactly two of the input rows have a 1 in the i-th position of their pre-5 part and a 1 in the j-th position of their post-5 part. \n\nApplying this to the Test Input:\n\nPre-5 parts:\n\nRow0: [1,0,1]\nRow1: [0,1,0]\nRow2: [1,0,1]\n\nPost-5 parts:\n\nRow0: [1,0,1]\nRow1: [1,0,1]\nRow2: [0,1,0]\n\nFor each cell (i,j):\n\nCheck how many rows have pre[i] =1 and post[j] =1.\n\nCell (0,0):\n\nRow0: pre0=1, post0=1 \u2192 yes.\nRow1: pre0=0 \u2192 no.\nRow2: pre0=1, post0=0 \u2192 no.\nCount=1 \u2192 0.\n\nCell (0,1):\n\nRow0: pre0=1, post1=0 \u2192 no.\nRow1: pre0=0 \u2192 no.\nRow2: pre0=1, post1=1 \u2192 yes.\nCount=1 \u2192 0.\n\nCell (0,2):\n\nRow0: pre0=1, post2=1 \u2192 yes.\nRow1: pre0=0 \u2192 no.\nRow2: pre0=1, post2=0 \u2192 no.\nCount=1 \u2192 0.\n\nCell (1,0):\n\nRow0: pre1=0 \u2192 no.\nRow1: pre1=1, post0=1 \u2192 yes.\nRow2: pre1=0 \u2192 no.\nCount=1 \u2192 0.\n\nCell (1,1):\n\nRow0: pre1=0 \u2192 no.\nRow1: pre1=1, post1=0 \u2192 no.\nRow2: pre1=0 \u2192 no.\nCount=0 \u2192 0.\n\nCell (1,2):\n\nRow0: pre1=0 \u2192 no.\nRow1: pre1=1, post2=1 \u2192 yes.\nRow2: pre1=0 \u2192 no.\nCount=1 \u21920.\n\nCell (2,0):\n\nRow0: pre2=1, post0=1 \u2192 yes.\nRow1: pre2=0 \u2192 no.\nRow2: pre2=1, post0=0 \u2192 no.\nCount=1 \u21920.\n\nCell (2,1):\n\nRow0: pre2=1, post1=0 \u2192 no.\nRow1: pre2=0 \u2192 no.\nRow2: pre2=1, post1=1 \u2192 yes.\nCount=1 \u21920.\n\nCell (2,2):\n\nRow0: pre2=1, post2=1 \u2192 yes.\nRow1: pre2=0 \u2192 no.\nRow2: pre2=1, post2=0 \u2192 no.\nCount=1 \u21920.\n\nThis results in all cells being 0, which is unlikely. So this hypothesis must be incorrect.\n\nAnother possible pattern: The output matrix is formed by taking the diagonal of the sum of the outer products of the pre-5 and post-5 vectors for each row, but I'm not sure.\n\nAfter struggling for so long, I think the correct pattern must involve comparing the pre-5 and post-5 parts across rows in a way that when the pre-5 and post-5 of the same row have a 1 in mirrored positions, you get a 2. For example, if pre-5 has a 1 in position 0 and post-5 has a 1 in position 2, that's a mirror.\n\nFor the Test Input's row0: pre-5 [1,0,1], post-5 [1,0,1]. The mirrored positions (0 and 2) both have 1s. Similarly, post-5 position 0 and 2 have 1s. So maybe this contributes to the output. \n\nIn Example1's row0 and row2: pre-5 [1,1,0], post-5 [0,1,0]. The mirrored position for pre and post would be pre0 and post2. Pre0 is 1, post2 is 0. So no match. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, the output cell (i,j) is 2 if the number of rows where pre[i] + post[j] == 2. So both are 1. Then count how many rows have this condition. For Test Input:\n\nCell (0,0): rows where pre0=1 and post0=1 \u2192 row0 and row1. Count=2 \u2192 output 2.\n\nCell (0,2): rows where pre0=1 and post2=1 \u2192 row0 and row1. Count=2 \u2192 output 2.\n\nCell (2,0): rows where pre2=1 and post0=1 \u2192 row0 and row1. Count=2 \u2192 output 2.\n\nCell (2,2): rows where pre2=1 and post2=1 \u2192 row0 and row1. Count=2 \u2192 output 2.\n\nBut this would result in output cells (0,0), (0,2), (2,0), (2,2) being 2. Which doesn't match any training example. For example, Example1's output has cells (0,1), (1,2), (2,1) as 2. So this doesn't fit.\n\nI'm running out of time and ideas. Given the time I've spent without success, I'll take a guess that the output is formed by taking each input row's post-5 part and for each 1, placing a 2 in the corresponding output position. For example, if a row's post-5 is [1,0,1], the output row would be [2,0,2]. But looking at Example0's middle row, post-5 is [1,1,1], but output is [0,2,0]. So maybe it's only the middle element. \n\nApplying this to the Test Input:\n\nRow0's post-5 is [1,0,1] \u2192 [2,0,2]\nRow1's post-5 is [1,0,1] \u2192 [2,0,2]\nRow2's post-5 is [0,1,0] \u2192 [0,2,0]\n\nBut the output would be:\n\n[2,0,2]\n[2,0,2]\n[0,2,0]\n\nBut this doesn't match any training example's structure. However, Example0's output is [0,2,0] for the middle row, which matches this pattern. But other rows in Example0's output are zeros, which would not fit. So this can't be right.\n\nGiven that I'm stuck, I'll make a educated guess based on the Test Input's structure and the training examples. The Test Input's output might have 2s in cells where the corresponding positions in the input's post-5 parts across all rows sum to 2. For example, if in position (0,0) of the output, the sum of post0 of all input rows is 2. Let's check:\n\nTest Input's post-0 positions (element4 of each row): row0 has 1, row1 has 1, row2 has 0. Sum=2. So output cell (0,0) would be 2. Similarly, post1 sum: 0 (row0) +0 (row1) +1 (row2) =1 \u2192 0. Post2 sum:1+1+0=2 \u2192 output cell (0,2)=2. Similarly for other cells. But how this applies to the examples.\n\nExample0's middle row post sum is 3, so if sum >=2, output 2. But in Example0's output, the middle cell is 2. But the sum is 3. So if sum >=2, output 2. For Test Input's post0 sum is 2 \u2192 output 2. This could fit. However, Example1's cell (0,1) has post1 sum 1+1+1=3 \u2192 output 2. Which matches.\n\nSo perhaps the output cell (i,j) is 2 if the sum of the j-th post-5 elements across all rows is exactly 2. \n\nApplying this to the Test Input's post-5 elements:\n\nPost0: 1 (row0) +1 (row1) +0 (row2) =2 \u2192 output cell (0,0) =2.\nPost1:0 +0 +1 =1 \u2192 0.\nPost2:1 +1 +0=2 \u2192 output cell (0,2)=2.\n\nWait, but output is a 3x3 matrix. Maybe each row's output corresponds to the post sums. But I'm not sure. This would give a row for each post sum, but I'm not sure how rows are determined.\n\nAlternatively, each output cell (i,j) is 2 if the sum of the j-th post-5 elements across all rows is 2. For Test Input, this would mean:\n\npost0 sum=2 \u2192 output cells (0,0), (1,0), (2,0) would be 2 if their i corresponds. But this doesn't align with the output structure.\n\nAt this point, I'm going to have to take a guess based on the examples and the Test Input. Given the Test Input's rows, I'll assume that the output is:\n\n[2, 0, 2]\n[0, 0, 0]\n[0, 2, 0]\n\nBut I'm not confident. However, considering the training examples, especially Example2 where the output has 2s in (1,0) and (2,2), which could correspond to rows where the pre-5 and post-5 have 1s in certain positions, maybe the Test Input's output is:\n\n[0, 0, 2]\n[2, 0, 0]\n[0, 0, 2]\n\nBut this is a shot in the dark. Given the time I've spent and lack of progress, I'll have to make a guess based on the possible patterns I've considered."
