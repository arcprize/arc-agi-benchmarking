        "cot_1": "Okay, let's see. I need to figure out the pattern that transforms the input grids into the output grids based on the training examples. Let me start by carefully examining the examples provided.\n\nLooking at Example 0's input and output. The input is a 10x10 grid. The output is a 3x3 grid. The input has a sort of symmetrical pattern with numbers like 7, 6, 8, 4 arranged in a diamond or circular shape. The output seems to be a smaller grid. Let me check the positions. \n\nIn the input, the non-zero numbers start around the middle. The output in Example 0 is:\n[0, 0, 7]\n[0, 6, 8]\n[7, 8, 4]\n\nLooking at the input grid for Example 0, the third row from the top (row index 2 maybe) has 7,7. Then row 3 has 6,8,8,6. Row 4 and 5 have 7,8,4, etc. Wait, maybe the output is taking a 3x3 section from the center of the input. But the input is 10x10, so the center would be around rows 4-6 and columns 4-6. Wait, but in the output of Example 0, the middle value is 4, which in the input's row 4 and 5 (0-based?) have 4s. Let me check the positions.\n\nWait, the input for Example 0's row 4 (assuming 0-based) is [0, 0, 7, 8, 4, 4, 8, 7, 0, 0]. The middle elements here are 4 and 4. So perhaps the output is centered around these 4s. The output's third row is [7,8,4], which might correspond to the middle part. But how exactly?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is taking the central 3x3 portion of the input. But the input is 10x10, so the center isn't exactly a single cell. Wait, 10 rows: the middle rows would be around 4.5, so perhaps rows 4,5,6? Similarly columns 4,5,6. Let me check. The input in Example 0's rows 4,5,6 are:\n\nRow 4: [0,0,7,8,4,4,8,7,0,0]\nRow 5: same as row 4.\nRow 6: [0,0,0,6,8,8,6,0,0,0]\n\nSo columns 4,5,6 in row 4 would be 4,4,8. Hmm, but the output's third row in Example0 is [7,8,4]. Wait, maybe not the exact center. Alternatively, maybe the output is a crop of the input's central 3x3. Let me check the positions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is formed by taking the top-left non-zero elements from each quadrant or something. Alternatively, maybe the output is the 3x3 grid starting from a certain offset.\n\nWait, in Example0's output, the numbers are 0,0,7; 0,6,8; 7,8,4. Let me check where these numbers appear in the input. The 7 in the top right of the output could be from the input's third row (row 2) where there's 7,7 in positions 4 and 5 (columns 4 and 5). Wait, but the output's top right is 7. Let me see:\n\nLooking at the input rows:\n\nRow 2: [0,0,0,0,7,7,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow 3: [0,0,0,6,8,8,6,0,0,0]\n\nRow4: [0,0,7,8,4,4,8,7,0,0]\n\nSo if the output is taking the center part, perhaps starting from row 2, column 3. Let's see. Row 2, column 3 would be 0. Hmm, maybe not. Alternatively, maybe the output is the 3x3 grid from the center of the input's non-zero area. Let's see where the non-zero elements are in Example0. The non-zero starts around row 2, column 4-5 (7s), then expands in the next rows. The output's bottom row is 7,8,4. In the input's row4, columns 2,3,4: 7,8,4. So perhaps the output's third row is taken from row4, columns 2,3,4. Then the middle row of the output would be row3, columns3-5: 6,8,8. But in the output, the middle row is [0,6,8]. Wait, that's not matching. Alternatively, maybe the output is taking a 3x3 area from row 2, column4 to row4, column6. Let's check:\n\nRow2: columns4-6: 7,7,0\nRow3: columns3-5:6,8,8\nRow4: columns2-4:7,8,4\nBut that would form a 3x3 grid that's:\n\n7,7,0\n6,8,8\n7,8,4\n\nBut the output is:\n\n0,0,7\n\n0,6,8\n\n7,8,4\n\nHmm, that doesn't align. Maybe there's another pattern.\n\nAlternatively, looking at Example1's input and output. The input is a 10x10 grid again, and the output is 3x3. The output is:\n\n[1,0,0]\n\n[0,3,6]\n\n[0,5,2]\n\nLooking at the input for Example1. The non-zero elements start in row1 (second row), columns1 and 6 (1s). Then rows2-5 have other numbers. The output's first row is [1,0,0], which could correspond to the 1 in row1, column1. Then the next rows in the output: [0,3,6] perhaps from row2, columns2-4. Let me check. Row2 of the input is [0,0,3,6,5,3,0,0,0,0]. Columns2-4 are 3,6,5. But the output's second row is [0,3,6]. Wait, that's 0,3,6. Maybe it's the first three elements of row2? Row2 starts with 0,0,3,6... So the first three elements are 0,0,3. But the output is 0,3,6. Hmm, not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is taking elements from a specific position. For example, in Example0's output, the third element of the first row is 7. In the input's row2, columns4 and5 are 7s. So maybe the output's first row's third element is the first 7 in row2. Then the second row's second element is 6, which is in row3, column3. The third row's first element is 7, which is in row4, column2. So maybe each element in the output is taken from a position that is offset from the center. Alternatively, it's a clockwise or counter-clockwise rotation or spiral.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the central 3x3 grid of the input, but shifted or transformed somehow. Let me check the positions of the output elements in the input.\n\nIn Example0's output, the elements are:\n\nRow0: [0,0,7] \u2192 possible from input row2, columns4,5,6? Row2 has [...,7,7,0], so columns4 is 7, column5 is7, column6 is0. But the output's third element is7. Hmm, maybe that's the first 7 in row2, column4. Then the 0s in the first two positions. But not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking the non-zero elements from the input in a certain order, but arranged into a 3x3. But in Example0's output, there are 0s as well. So maybe it's a pattern where each cell in the 3x3 output is a specific cell relative to the center of the input.\n\nThe input grids are 10x10. The center would be between rows 4-5 and columns 4-5. Maybe the output is capturing a 3x3 area around that center. For example, rows 4,5,6 and columns4,5,6. Let's check Example0:\n\nRow4: columns4-6: 4,4,8\n\nRow5: same as row4.\n\nRow6: columns4-6:8,8,6.\n\nBut the output's third row is [7,8,4], which would be from row4, columns2,3,4 (7,8,4). So that's not centered. So maybe not the exact center.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is formed by looking for the top-leftmost non-zero in each layer. Wait, maybe the output is the core of the input's structure. Let's think of the input as a symmetrical pattern. For example, in Example0, the input is symmetrical vertically and horizontally. The output is a 3x3 that's the core of that symmetry. The output's middle is 4, which is the center of the input. Then the surrounding numbers are 6,7,8. So perhaps the output is the central 3x3 of the input's structure, but the input has a diamond shape. So the output might be the innermost part.\n\nWait, looking at the input of Example0, the numbers form a diamond shape. The outermost layer is 0s. Then a layer of 7s, then 6 and 8, then 8 and 4. The output is taking the innermost 3x3 of that diamond. Let's see:\n\nThe diamond in Example0's input has layers. The innermost layer is the two rows (rows4 and5) with 4s. The layer around that has 8s. Then 6s and7s. The output could be the 3x3 from the center. For rows4-6 and columns3-5. Let's check:\n\nRow4: columns3-5 \u2192 8,4,4 \u2192 but output's third row is [7,8,4]. Hmm, that doesn't align. Alternatively, maybe the output is a rotated or transformed version. Maybe it's the top-left part of the diamond's center.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each output row is taken from a different concentric layer of the input. For example, the first row of the output comes from the outermost non-zero layer, the middle row from the next layer, etc. But in Example0's output, the first row is [0,0,7], which might correspond to the 7s in row2, column4-5. The middle row [0,6,8] could be from row3, columns3-5 (6,8,8). The third row [7,8,4] is from row4, columns2-4 (7,8,4). So each row in the output is taking elements from different rows and columns. The output's first row takes the first non-zero elements from the top layer, perhaps. Let's see:\n\nIn Example0, the first output row is [0,0,7]. Looking at row2 in the input, which is [0,0,0,0,7,7,0,0,0,0]. The first two elements are 0, then 0,0, then 7,7. So maybe the output's first row is the middle three elements of row2. Wait, row2's elements are 0,0,0,0,7,7,0,0,0,0. The middle would be around columns4-6 (7,7,0). But the output's first row is [0,0,7]. So perhaps the third element is from column5 (7), the first two are 0. So maybe for each layer, the output takes certain positions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is formed by taking the first three non-zero elements from each of three central rows, but arranged in a certain way. Let's check Example1's output:\n\nOutput for Example1 is:\n\n[1,0,0]\n\n[0,3,6]\n\n[0,5,2]\n\nLooking at the input's row1 (second row) has [0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0]. The first three elements are 0,1,0. But the output's first row is [1,0,0]. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the output is capturing the first occurrence of non-zero elements in each row, but that doesn't fit exactly.\n\nAnother approach: perhaps the output is the 3x3 grid starting from the first non-zero row and column. Let's check Example0. The first non-zero row is row2 (third row). The first non-zero in that row is at column4. So starting from row2, column4, take a 3x3 grid. But row2, column4 is 7. Let's see:\n\nRow2: columns4-6 \u2192 7,7,0\n\nRow3: columns4-6 \u21928,8,6\n\nRow4: columns4-6 \u21924,4,8\n\nBut that would form:\n\n7 7 0\n\n8 8 6\n\n4 4 8\n\nWhich doesn't match the output. The output's first row is [0,0,7]. So maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the 3x3 grid from the first three non-zero elements in three consecutive rows. For Example0, the first non-zero rows are rows2,3,4. Let's take the first three non-zero elements from each. For row2: 7,7. But how to get three elements? Maybe take the first three non-zero, but row2 has two 7s. Hmm, that's not enough.\n\nAlternatively, the output could be a rotated version of a certain part. For instance, rotating a section of the input by 90 degrees. Let's see. In Example0's output, the third row is [7,8,4]. Looking at the input's row4, columns2-4:7,8,4. So if that's part of the output. Then the middle row of the output is row3, columns3-5:6,8,8. But the output's middle row is [0,6,8]. So maybe taking the middle element (8) and the previous elements. Wait, in row3, columns3 is6, column4 is8, column5 is8. So the middle row of the output is [6,8,8], but the actual output is [0,6,8]. So perhaps there's a shift. Maybe it's taking elements from a diagonal.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking the middle elements of each layer. For example, the input's layers form concentric diamonds, and the output captures the three middle elements from each of the three layers.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is the central 3x3 grid of the input after removing all outer layers of zeros. For example, in Example0's input, if we remove all outer zeros, we get a smaller grid. Let's see. The input has non-zero elements starting from row2 to row7 (assuming 0-based). So the non-zero part is from row2 to row7 (6 rows) and columns3 to 6 (4 columns). Not a square. So trimming the zeros to get the inner part and then taking the center 3x3. Maybe not.\n\nWait, the output is always 3x3. Let's check the Test Input. The test input is a 10x10 grid. Let me try to apply the same pattern as the examples once I figure it out.\n\nAnother approach: Let's look for the positions of the output elements in the input. For Example0's output:\n\nFirst row of output: [0,0,7]. Where is 7 located in the input? Row2, columns4 and5. So perhaps the third element in the first output row is the first 7 in row2. Then the first two elements are zeros. Similarly, the second row of the output is [0,6,8]. 6 is in row3, column3. 8 is in row3, columns4 and5. So 6 is at row3, column3, and 8 is at row3, column4. The third element is 8 (row3, column5). Then the third row of the output is [7,8,4]. 7 is row4, column2; 8 is row4, column3; 4 is row4, column4.\n\nSo for each row in the output, the elements are taken from different positions:\n\n- First output row: elements from row2, columns4,5,6? But output is [0,0,7]. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the output is capturing a diagonal or some pattern. Looking at the output elements:\n\n0,0,7\n\n0,6,8\n\n7,8,4\n\nThe positions in the input might be:\n\n(2,4) \u2192 7\n\n(3,3) \u21926\n\n(3,4) \u21928\n\n(4,2) \u21927\n\n(4,3) \u21928\n\n(4,4) \u21924\n\nSo if we arrange these in a 3x3 grid, the coordinates would be:\n\nRow0: (2,4), (2, something else?), but not sure. Alternatively, the output is a mirror or a rotated version.\n\nAlternatively, the output is the transpose of some part. For example, the output's first column is 0,0,7. In the input, column2 has 7 in row4. Column3 has 6 in row3. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking elements from three consecutive rows, each shifted left by one. For example:\n\nRow2: [0,0,0,0,7,7,0,0,0,0] \u2192 take elements 4,5,6 \u21927,7,0 \u2192 but output row0 is [0,0,7]. So maybe shifted left.\n\nWait, maybe the output for each row is the first three non-zero elements from the corresponding input row. For Example0's row2: first non-zero is at column4 (7), then column5 (7), then next is column6 (0). But output's first row is [0,0,7]. Not sure.\n\nAnother idea: Maybe the output is the 3x3 grid starting from the top-left of the non-zero area. For Example0, the first non-zero is in row2, column4. So the 3x3 would start there. But row2, column4 is 7. Then the next rows would be row3, column4 (8), row4, column4 (4). Columns would be 4,5,6. So the 3x3 would be:\n\n7,7,0\n\n8,8,6\n\n4,4,8\n\nBut this doesn't match the output. So that's not it.\n\nWait, in Example0's output, the third row is [7,8,4], which is row4, columns2,3,4. So perhaps each row in the output is taken from a different row in the input, but shifted left. For example, row0 of output comes from row2, columns4-6 \u21927,7,0 \u2192 but output row0 is [0,0,7]. Hmm. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is a rotated version of a subset. For example, taking a section and rotating it 90 degrees. Let's see. Take a 3x3 from the center and rotate it. In Example0, the center 3x3 would be:\n\nrow4-6, columns4-6:\n\nrow4:4,4,8\n\nrow5:4,4,8\n\nrow6:8,8,6\n\nBut this doesn't match the output. So maybe not.\n\nLet's look at Example1's output. Output is:\n\n1,0,0\n\n0,3,6\n\n0,5,2\n\nThe input for Example1 has non-zero elements starting in row1 (0-based?), row1 has 1s in column1 and 6. Then row2 has 3,6,5,3. Row3 has 5,2,2,6. Row4 has6,2,2,5. So perhaps the output's first row is [1,0,0], which is from row1, column1 (1), and then zeros. Then the second row is [0,3,6], which could be from row2, columns2-4 (3,6,5). But why 3,6? The output's second row is 0,3,6. So maybe the first element is 0, then 3,6. That matches row2's elements starting from column2:3,6,5. So first three elements of row2 are 0,0,3. So perhaps the output's second row is [0,3,6], which would require taking column2-4 of row2:3,6,5. But output is 0,3,6. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is formed by taking elements from three different rows, each shifted. For Example1's output:\n\nRow0: 1,0,0 \u2192 perhaps from row1, column1, and the next two columns (0,0). Row1: [0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0]. So column1 is1, columns2-3 are0,0. So that's 1,0,0. Which matches the first output row.\n\nRow1 of output:0,3,6. Let's look at row2 of input: [0,0,3,6,5,3,0,0,0,0]. Columns2-4 are3,6,5. So output row1 is 0,3,6 \u2192 which could be columns2-4 of row2, but why the first element is0. Wait, row2's first three columns are0,0,3. So if the output's second row is taking columns2-4, that would be0,3,6. But in the input, row2's columns2-4 are3,6,5. So that doesn't fit. Unless there's a shift.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output's rows are taken from different parts of the input. For Example1's output:\n\n- First row: row1, columns1-3 \u2192 [0,1,0] \u2192 but output is [1,0,0]. Not matching.\n- Second row: row2, columns2-4 \u21923,6,5 \u2192 but output is0,3,6.\n- Third row: row3, columns2-4 \u21925,2,2 \u2192 but output is0,5,2.\n\nHmm, not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking elements from the input's rows and columns that are mirrored. For example, in Example0's output, the third row's first element is7, which is in row4, column2. Column2 is mirrored around the center. For a 10x10 grid, the center is between columns4 and5. So column2 is mirrored to column7 (since 10-2-1=7). But not sure how that helps.\n\nAnother approach: perhaps the output is the upper-left 3x3 section of the input after some transformation, like flipping or rotating. Let me check Example0's input. If we rotate the input 90 degrees clockwise, the upper-left 3x3 might become the lower-right. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the output could be the first 3 elements of the middle three rows. For Example0, rows4,5,6 are the middle. Row4: [0,0,7,8,4,4,8,7,0,0]. First three elements:0,0,7. Which matches the output's third row's first element. But the output's third row is [7,8,4]. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe the output is formed by taking the central 3x3 of the input after removing all even layers of zeros. Or perhaps it's capturing the first occurrence of non-zero elements in a spiral pattern.\n\nAlternatively, the output is formed by taking the three middle rows and three middle columns of the input. For a 10x10 grid, the middle rows would be 4,5,6 (0-based). Middle columns 4,5,6. Let's check for Example0:\n\nRow4: columns4-6:4,4,8\n\nRow5: same as row4.\n\nRow6: columns4-6:8,8,6\n\nSo the 3x3 would be:\n\n4 4 8\n\n4 4 8\n\n8 8 6\n\nBut the output is different. So that's not it.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking the three middle rows and three middle columns, but from a different position. For example, rows 3,4,5 and columns 3,4,5. For Example0:\n\nRow3: [0,0,0,6,8,8,6,0,0,0] \u2192 columns3-5:6,8,8\n\nRow4: columns3-5:8,4,4\n\nRow5: same as row4.\n\nSo that would give:\n\n6,8,8\n\n8,4,4\n\n8,4,4\n\nBut the output's middle row is [0,6,8]. Doesn't match.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is formed by taking certain diagonals. For Example0's output:\n\nThe elements are:\n\n0 0 7\n\n0 6 8\n\n7 8 4\n\nThe diagonal from top-right to bottom-left is7,6,7. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each row in the output is a diagonal from the input. For example, first row of output is the diagonal starting at row2, column4 (7), then row3, column3 (6), row4, column2 (7). But the output's first row is [0,0,7], which would need to be the third element. Not sure.\n\nAnother Idea: The output could be a 3x3 kernel extracted from the input where each cell in the kernel corresponds to the maximum or a certain value in the surrounding cells. But in Example0's output, the numbers are not the max of their neighbors. For example, the middle of the output is 6, which is less than 8 and 7 around it.\n\nAlternatively, the output is the top-left 3x3 of the input's quadrant. For example, split the input into four quadrants and take the top-left 3x3 of the center. But not sure.\n\nWait, looking at both examples:\n\nExample0's input has a symmetrical diamond shape, and the output is a 3x3 that seems to capture the transition from outer layers to inner layers.\n\nExample1's input has a more complex pattern, but the output includes a 1 from the top row, then numbers from the middle rows.\n\nAnother approach: Let's see the output for Example0 and Example1:\n\nExample0 output:\n\nRow0:0,0,7\n\nRow1:0,6,8\n\nRow2:7,8,4\n\nExample1 output:\n\nRow0:1,0,0\n\nRow1:0,3,6\n\nRow2:0,5,2\n\nIn Example0's output, the numbers increase towards the bottom-right. In Example1, it's more varied.\n\nLooking for a pattern in the positions:\n\nFor Example0's output:\n\n- The 7 in row0, column2: input row2, column4\n\n- The 6 in row1, column1: input row3, column3\n\n- The 8 in row1, column2: input row3, column4\n\n- The 7 in row2, column0: input row4, column2\n\n- The 8 in row2, column1: input row4, column3\n\n- The 4 in row2, column2: input row4, column4\n\nSo the output's positions are:\n\nrow0, column2 \u2192 input row2, column4\n\nrow1, column1 \u2192 input row3, column3\n\nrow1, column2 \u2192 input row3, column4\n\nrow2, column0 \u2192 input row4, column2\n\nrow2, column1 \u2192 input row4, column3\n\nrow2, column2 \u2192 input row4, column4\n\nIt seems like for each output cell (i,j), the input cell is (2+i+j, 4-j). Let's test:\n\nFor row0, column2 (i=0,j=2): 2+0+2=4; 4-2=2 \u2192 input row4, column2 \u2192 but in Example0's output, row0, column2 is7, which is input row2, column4. So that doesn't match.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output cell (i,j) maps to input cell (row = 2 + i + j, column = 4 - i + j). Let's test:\n\nFor output cell (0,2): i=0, j=2.\n\nrow =2+0+2=4 \u2192 input row4.\n\ncolumn=4-0 +2=6.\n\nInput row4, column6 is8. But output cell (0,2) is7. So no.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output cell (i,j) corresponds to input cell (2i + j, 4 - i). For example:\n\ni=0,j=0 \u2192 row0, column4 \u2192 input row0, column4 is0.\n\ni=0,j=1 \u2192 row0, column3 \u21920.\n\ni=0,j=2 \u2192 row0, column2 \u21920.\n\nBut Example0's output row0 is [0,0,7]. So that's not matching.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is formed by taking every other element from specific rows and columns. For Example0:\n\nRow2 of input: [0,0,0,0,7,7,0,0,0,0]. Columns4 and5 are7s. Output row0 has 7 as third element. So maybe columns4,5,6, but only the first non-zero? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the Test Input:\n\nTest Input:\n\nRow2: [0,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow3: [0,0,0,4,4,8,4,0,0,0]\n\nRow4: [0,0,8,8,3,3,4,0,0,0]\n\nRow5: [0,0,0,4,3,3,8,8,0,0]\n\nRow6: [0,0,0,4,8,4,4,0,0,0]\n\nRow7: [0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nSo the non-zero elements start from row2, column5 (8), then row3 has 4,4,8,4, row4 has8,8,3,3,4, etc.\n\nIf the pattern is similar to the training examples, the output will be a 3x3 grid. Looking at the training examples' outputs, they seem to capture the initial non-zero elements in a certain order.\n\nFor Example0's output, the first row is [0,0,7], which comes from row2 of the input. The third element is7, which is the first non-zero in that row. Then the second row is [0,6,8], which could be row3's first non-zero at column3 (6), then column4 (8). The third row is [7,8,4], which is row4's first non-zero at column2 (7), then column3 (8), then column4 (4).\n\nSimilarly, for Example1's output:\n\nFirst row:1 from row1, column1.\n\nSecond row:0,3,6 from row2's columns2-4 (3,6,5). But output is [0,3,6]. Maybe the first element is0 (from row2, column0?), but not sure. Wait, row2 in Example1's input is [0,0,3,6,5,3,0,0,0,0]. The first three elements are0,0,3. So the output's second row is [0,3,6]. That could be columns2-4 of row2:3,6,5. But how does that become 0,3,6? Because in the input row2, columns2 is3, column3 is6, column4 is5. So the output's second row is [0,3,6]. Where does the 0 come from?\n\nWait, perhaps the output is taking the first three elements of the input's rows, starting from the first non-zero row. For Example0, the first non-zero row is row2. Taking the first three elements:0,0,0. But output's first row is [0,0,7]. That doesn't fit. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is the first three elements of the first three non-zero rows. For Example0, the first non-zero row is row2, which has [0,0,0,0,7,7,0,0,0,0]. First three elements are0,0,0. But output's first row is [0,0,7]. Not matching.\n\nWait, maybe the output's rows are formed by taking the first three non-zero elements from each corresponding row in the input, but skipping zeros. For Example0's row2: elements are7,7. But the output's first row is [0,0,7]. Doesn't fit.\n\nAlternative approach: Compare the positions of the output elements in the input for both examples.\n\nExample0's output elements:\n\n- 7 (top right): row2, column4 or5\n\n-6 (middle left): row3, column3\n\n-8 (middle center): row3, column4 or5\n\n-7 (bottom left): row4, column2\n\n-8 (bottom middle): row4, column3\n\n-4 (bottom right): row4, column4\n\nExample1's output elements:\n\n-1 (top left): row1, column1\n\n-3 (middle center): row2, column2\n\n-6 (middle right): row2, column3\n\n-5 (bottom center): row3, column2\n\n-2 (bottom right): row3, column3\n\nSo the positions are varying. But perhaps there's a pattern in the row and column indices.\n\nIn Example0, the output elements' rows are 2,3,4. In Example1, the rows are1,2,3.\n\nThe columns for Example0 are 4,3,4,2,3,4. For Example1, the columns are1,2,3,2,3.\n\nSo the pattern might be that each output element is taken from the input row that is two more than the output row index. For example, output row0 corresponds to input row2, output row1 to input row3, output row2 to input row4. Then, the column index for output column j in row i is 4 - i + j. Let's check:\n\nFor Example0's output row0 (i=0), j=2:\n\ncolumn =4 -0 +2=6. Input row2, column6 is0. But output is7. Not matching.\n\nAlternatively, column =4 - (i - j). For Example0's output row0, j=2:\n\n4 - (0 -2)=6. Input row2, column6 is0. No.\n\nAlternatively, column = i + j + something.\n\nWait, in Example0's output row0, j=2, the input column is4. So 4=0 +2 +2.\n\nIn row1, j=1: input column3 =1+1+2=4? No. 3=1+1+1=3.\n\nIn row2, j=0: input column2 =2+0 +0=2.\n\nThis seems inconsistent.\n\nAlternatively, the column index for each output element is the center column (4.5 for 10 columns) plus some offset. For Example0's output elements:\n\n- row0, j=2: column5 (since 7s are in columns4 and5 of row2). But the output's j=2 would correspond to column5.\n\nBut for row3, column3 (6) is column3. So not sure.\n\nAnother Idea: The output is the 3x3 grid formed by the first three non-zero elements from three consecutive rows in the input, each shifted left by one. For Example0:\n\nRow2: 7,7 \u2192 shifted left by two positions gives [7,7,0] \u2192 but output row0 is [0,0,7]. Doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, the output is formed by taking the first three non-zero elements from each of three consecutive rows, but in reverse order. For Example0's row2:7,7 \u2192 reversed would be7,7,0. Output row0 is [0,0,7]. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, for each of the three output rows, take the first three non-zero elements from the corresponding input row, skipping zeros, and pad with zeros if necessary. For Example0's row2: 7,7 \u2192 so output row0 would be7,7,0. But the actual output is [0,0,7]. Not matching.\n\nExample1's row2 has3,6,5,3 \u2192 first three non-zero are3,6,5 \u2192 output row1 is0,3,6. So again not matching.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Let me try to find another approach.\n\nLooking at the Test Input:\n\nTest Input's non-zero elements are centered around rows2-7 and columns3-8. For example, row2 has 8 at column5. Row3 has4,4,8,4. Row4 has8,8,3,3,4. Row5 has4,3,3,8,8. Row6 has4,8,4,4. Row7 has8 at column5.\n\nIf the pattern from the examples is to take three rows and three columns from the input where non-zero elements start, perhaps the output for the Test Input would be:\n\nLooking for a 3x3 section. Let's try to find where the first non-zero elements appear. For example, row2 has an 8 at column5. Row3 has non-zero starting at column3 (4). Row4 starts at column2 (8). So maybe the output is formed by taking row3, row4, row5, and columns3,4,5. Let's check:\n\nRow3: columns3-5 \u21924,4,8\n\nRow4: columns2-4 \u21928,8,3\n\nRow5: columns3-5 \u21924,3,3\n\nSo the 3x3 would be:\n\n4 4 8\n\n8 8 3\n\n4 3 3\n\nBut the training examples' outputs don't seem to follow this pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking the first three non-zero elements from three consecutive rows. For Test Input's row2:8 at column5. So first non-zero is8. Row3:4 at column3. So first three non-zero elements are4,4,8. Row4:8 at column2. So first three non-zero elements are8,8,3. Row5:4 at column3. So first three are4,3,3.\n\nBut then output would be:\n\n[8,0,0]\n\n[4,4,8]\n\n[8,8,3]\n\nBut this doesn't match the format of the training examples.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is the 3x3 grid centered on the highest value in the input. For Example0's input, the highest value is8. The output's middle row is6,8. Example1's highest is6. Test Input's highest is8. But how this would form the output is unclear.\n\nAnother Idea: Looking at the outputs of the training examples, their outputs have the same dimensions as a 3x3 matrix. Maybe the pattern is that the output is the 3x3 grid starting at the position of the first non-zero element in the input. For Example0, the first non-zero element is in row2, column4 (7). Starting from there, the 3x3 would be:\n\nRow2:7,7,0\n\nRow3:0,0,6\n\nRow4:0,0,7\n\nBut that's not the case. So probably not.\n\nAlternatively, the output is the 3x3 grid formed by the first non-zero element, then moving down and right in a certain way.\n\nAnother approach: Compare the outputs to see if there's a mathematical relationship between input and output values. For Example0's output, the middle element is6, which is surrounded by8s in the input. But not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the output could be a convolution or some kernel operation. For example, each output cell is the sum or difference of surrounding cells. But without more examples, it's hard to say.\n\nAlternatively, the output could be the first three non-zero elements encountered when traversing the input in a specific order, like row-wise, then arranged into a 3x3. For Example0, the first three non-zero elements are7,7,6. But the output starts with0,0,7. So that's not it.\n\nAfter struggling to find the pattern, perhaps the output is the central part of the input's structure, taking the middle three rows and columns. For a 10x10 input, the middle rows are4,5,6 and columns4,5,6. But Example0's output doesn't match that. But let's check the Test Input's middle rows and columns.\n\nTest Input's rows4-6 and columns4-6:\n\nRow4: columns4-6 \u21923,3,4\n\nRow5: columns4-6 \u21923,3,8\n\nRow6: columns4-6 \u21928,4,4\n\nSo 3x3:\n\n3 3 4\n\n3 3 8\n\n8 4 4\n\nBut this doesn't match any obvious pattern from the examples.\n\nAnother Idea: Let's look for the positions of the output elements in the input for both examples.\n\nExample0's output:\n\n[0,0,7] \u2192 row2, column4 or5\n\n[0,6,8] \u2192 row3, column3 and4\n\n[7,8,4] \u2192 row4, column2,3,4\n\nSo the positions are moving inward. Perhaps the output is capturing the elements along the edges of a diamond, moving inward.\n\nExample1's output:\n\n[1,0,0] \u2192 row1, column1\n\n[0,3,6] \u2192 row2, columns2,3\n\n[0,5,2] \u2192 row3, columns2,3\n\nSo the pattern is taking elements from specific positions relative to the center.\n\nAlternatively, the output is the three layers of the diamond structure. For Example0, the outer layer is7s, then6 and8, then4s. The output captures these layers' elements in a 3x3 grid.\n\nBut how? The output has 0s, which are from the surrounding zeros. Maybe the output is the three layers of the diamond arranged in a 3x3.\n\nAlternatively, the output is the top-left part of the diamond. For Example0, the diamond's top layer is at row2, columns4-5 (7s). Then next layer at row3, columns3-6 (6,8,8,6). Then row4, columns2-7 (7,8,4,4,8,7). The output's first row is the top of the diamond (7s), the middle row the next layer (6 and8), and the third row the next layer (7,8,4). So maybe each row of the output is the first three elements of each layer's left side.\n\nIn Example0, the first layer (row2) has7,7 \u2192 but output row0 has0,0,7. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, each row in the output corresponds to a different layer, taking the first three elements from that layer.\n\nBut this is getting too vague. Let's try to find a pattern that can be applied to the Test Input.\n\nThe Test Input has non-zero elements in a similar diamond shape. The highest numbers are8s and 3s. For example, row4 has8,8,3,3,4. Row5 has4,3,3,8,8. So the center seems to be around3s.\n\nIf the pattern from the training examples is to take the first three non-zero elements from the top, middle, and bottom layers of the diamond, then for the Test Input, the output might be:\n\nFirst row: from row3, the first non-zero elements are4,4,8. But the output's first row might be [0,0,8] (from row2's 8 at column5). \n\nSecond row: from row4's first non-zero elements8,8,3.\n\nThird row: from row5's first non-zero elements4,3,3.\n\nBut arranging these into a 3x3:\n\n[0,0,8]\n\n[8,8,3]\n\n[4,3,3]\n\nBut the training examples have different structures. For example, Example0's output starts with 0s and the first non-zero element in the top row is the third element. So perhaps the Test Input's output first row would have the 8 from row2, column5 as the third element. Then the second row would have the first non-zero elements from row3, columns3-5:4,4,8. But how to arrange them.\n\nAlternatively, following Example0's pattern where the output's rows come from input rows2,3,4:\n\nFor Test Input:\n\nRow2: [0,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0]. The first non-zero is8 at column5. So the output's first row might be [0,0,8].\n\nRow3: [0,0,0,4,4,8,4,0,0,0]. First non-zero is4 at column3. So output's second row starts with4. Then next elements are4,8.\n\nSo second row: [0,4,4].\n\nRow4: [0,0,8,8,3,3,4,0,0,0]. First non-zero is8 at column2. Output's third row: [8,8,3].\n\nSo the output would be:\n\n[0,0,8]\n\n[0,4,4]\n\n[8,8,3]\n\nBut Example0's output starts with zeros and then has non-zero elements. However, Example1's output has a 1 in the first element. So maybe the pattern is more about the position of the elements rather than the first non-zero.\n\nAlternatively, the output for the Test Input could be:\n\n[0,0,8]\n\n[0,4,8]\n\n[8,8,3]\n\nWhich is similar to Example0's structure.\n\nBut without knowing the exact pattern, it's challenging. However, based on the training examples, the output seems to be a 3x3 grid extracted from the input's central structure, possibly taking the first non-zero elements from three specific rows. Given the time I've spent, I'll proceed with an educated guess.\n\nFor the Test Input:\n\nLooking for a 3x3 grid where:\n\n- The first row is from row2's non-zero elements, likely the 8 at column5. So [0,0,8].\n\n- The second row is from row3's non-zero elements:4,4,8. So [0,4,4].\n\n- The third row is from row4's non-zero elements:8,8,3. So [8,8,3].\n\nBut this doesn't match the training examples' pattern. Alternatively, if the output is taking elements from the first occurrence of non-zero in each row, but shifted:\n\nTest Input's row2 has8 at column5. So output row0: [0,0,8].\n\nRow3 has4 at column3: output row1: [0,4,4].\n\nRow4 has8 at column2: output row2: [8,8,3].\n\nSo the output would be:\n\n[0, 0, 8]\n\n[0, 4, 4]\n\n[8, 8, 3]\n\nBut comparing to the training examples, Example0's output third row has elements from lower rows. Maybe the Test Input's output should be:\n\n[0,0,0]\n\n[0,4,8]\n\n[8,8,3]\n\nBut I'm not confident. Alternatively, perhaps the output is the same pattern as the training examples, where the output rows correspond to input rows 2,3,4 and columns 5,4,3. For example:\n\nRow2, column5 is8 \u2192 output row0, column2.\n\nRow3, column4 is4 \u2192 output row1, column1.\n\nRow3, column5 is8 \u2192 output row1, column2.\n\nRow4, column3 is8 \u2192 output row2, column1.\n\nRow4, column4 is3 \u2192 output row2, column2.\n\nBut this is speculative.\n\nAlternatively, considering the Test Input's structure, which seems to have a diamond pattern with 8s and 3s, the output might be:\n\n[0, 0, 8]\n\n[0, 4, 8]\n\n[8, 8, 3]\n\nBut I'm not sure. Given the time constraints, I'll go with this as a possible answer based on the training examples' patterns.",

        "cot_2": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. So, looking at the training examples, each input is a 10x10 grid of numbers, and the output is a 3x3 grid. The goal is to see how the input gets transformed into the output.\n\nStarting with Example 0. The input has a lot of zeros, but there's a sort of diamond or symmetrical shape in the middle with numbers 7, 8, 6, 4, etc. The output is a 3x3 matrix. Let me see where those numbers come from. The output is:\n\n[0, 0, 7]\n[0, 6, 8]\n[7, 8, 4]\n\nLooking at the input grid, maybe the output is taking the center part? Let's check the positions. The input's center is around the 5th row and 5th column. For instance, in the input of Example 0, row 3 (0-indexed) starts with 0s, then 6,8,8,6. The next rows have 7,8,4, etc. The output seems to be a 3x3 grid that's taking the central 3x3 part. But wait, the output's first row is [0,0,7], but in the input, the third row (index 2) has [0,0,0,0,7,7,0,0,0,0]. The 7s are at positions 4 and 5. So maybe the center is at row 4 and column 4, but let's check.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's taking the center 3x3 area. For a 10x10 grid, the exact center might not be a single cell but around row 4.5 and column 4.5. So the central 3x3 would be rows 4,5,6 and columns 4,5,6? Wait, let's see. For example, in the input of Example 0, the row 3 (third row) is [0, 0, 0, 6, 8, 8, 6, 0, 0, 0]. The next rows have 7,8,4 etc. Wait, perhaps the output is taking the center 3x3 area. Let me check the input for Example 0:\n\nLooking at rows 4,5,6. Row 4: [0,0,7,8,4,4,8,7,0,0]. The center here would be around positions 4 and 5. But the output's third row is [7,8,4]. Hmm. Wait, maybe the output is a 3x3 grid taken from the central part of the input. Let me check the positions. For Example 0's input, the output's first row is [0,0,7], which might correspond to the third row (index 2) of the input. But the third row in the input is [0,0,0,0,7,7,0,0,0,0]. So the fifth and sixth elements are 7s. How does that become the third element of the output's first row? Maybe it's taking the central three elements from the central three rows?\n\nWait, maybe the output is formed by taking the central 3x3 block of the input. Let's see. For a 10x10 grid, the exact center would be between rows 4 and 5. So maybe the central rows are 4,5,6. Let's check Example 0:\n\nRow 4: [0,0,7,8,4,4,8,7,0,0]\nRow 5: same as row 4\nRow 6: [0,0,0,6,8,8,6,0,0,0]\n\nWait, but the output is 3x3. The output for Example 0 is:\n\nRow 0: 0,0,7\nRow 1: 0,6,8\nRow 2:7,8,4\n\nHmm. If the output is taking from the center, maybe the central rows are 3,4,5. Let's check row 3 of input Example 0: [0, 0, 0, 6, 8, 8, 6, 0, 0, 0]. The middle elements here would be 8,8. But the output's first row (assuming row 3) has 0,6,8. Wait, maybe the columns are taken from positions 3,4,5. So for row 3, columns 3,4,5 are 6,8,8. But the output's first row is [0,0,7], which doesn't match. Hmm. Maybe I'm looking at the wrong rows.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is capturing the first occurrence of non-zero elements in a certain pattern. Let's look at Example 0's input. The output starts with 0,0,7. Maybe the first non-zero elements moving from the top towards the center. Or perhaps the output is a 3x3 grid taken from a specific position relative to the maximum value in the input. For Example 0, the maximum value is 8. Wait, but in the output, the center is 4. Hmm. Maybe not.\n\nLooking at Example 1. The input is:\n\nRows with 1s and 3,5,6, etc. The output is:\n\n[1, 0, 0]\n[0, 3, 6]\n[0, 5, 2]\n\nLooking at the input for Example 1, the first non-zero row is row 1 (index 1) which has [0,1,0,...]. The output's first row is [1,0,0]. That matches the 1 in row 1, column 1 (index 1). Then the next row in the output is [0,3,6]. Looking at the input's row 2 (index 2): [0,0,3,6,5,3,0...], the third element is 3, fourth is 6. So if output's second row is 0,3,6, maybe that's columns 2,3,4? But the output's second element is 3, which is at column 2 (index 2) in row 2 of input. Then third element is 6 (column 3). Then the third row of output is [0,5,2], which corresponds to row 3 of input: [0,0,5,2,2,6,...]. Columns 2,3,4: 5,2,2. But output's third row is 0,5,2. So maybe the output is taking the first three elements from certain rows. For example, in Example 1's output, the first row is [1,0,0], which is from row 1, columns 1,2,3. The second row is [0,3,6] from row 2, columns 2,3,4. Third row is [0,5,2] from row 3, columns 2,3,4. Wait, but that seems inconsistent. Alternatively, maybe the output is taking the first three non-zero elements from each of the central rows, but that doesn't fit exactly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is the 3x3 grid starting at a certain position. For Example 0, the output's first row is 0,0,7. Looking at input row 2 (third row) of Example 0: [0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0]. The 7s are at positions 4 and 5 (0-based). So if we take columns 3,4,5 from row 2, that's 0,7,7. But the output is 0,0,7. Hmm. Not matching. Alternatively, maybe the output is taking the central 3x3 of the non-zero region. For Example 0, the non-zero numbers form a diamond shape. The center of that diamond is at row 4 and 5, column 4 and 5. So perhaps the output is the central 3x3 of that structure. For instance, in the input of Example 0, row 4 is [0,0,7,8,4,4,8,7,0,0]. The middle part would be 8,4,4. But the output's third row is [7,8,4]. Maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps the output is the top-left part of the central structure. Wait, maybe the pattern is that the output is the 3x3 grid starting from the first occurrence of a non-zero element in the third row (assuming rows are 0-based) and then taking three rows and three columns from there.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the 3x3 grid that is the \"core\" of the structure in the input. For Example 0, the input has a symmetrical pattern. The output seems to capture the innermost part. Let's see:\n\nLooking at Example 0's input, the innermost part is the 4,4 in the center. The output's last row is [7,8,4]. Maybe the output is capturing a 3x3 area that includes the highest numbers. But in Example 0, the highest number is 8, but in the output, there's 8 and 4.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the upper-left 3x3 section of the input's non-zero area. Let's see: For Example 0, the first non-zero row is row 2 (third row) with 7s. The upper-left 3x3 of that would be starting at row 2, column 4 (since the 7s are at columns 4 and 5). But that would be 0,7,7? Not sure.\n\nWait, looking at the output of Example 0:\n\nRow 0: 0,0,7 \u2192 possibly from row 2, columns 3,4,5. Let's check. Row 2: [0,0,0,0,7,7,0,0,0,0]. Columns 3 is 0, column 4 is 7, column 5 is 7. So [0,7,7], but output's first row is [0,0,7]. That doesn't match. Hmm.\n\nAnother approach: look at the positions of the output numbers in the input. For Example 0's output:\n\nFirst row, third element is 7. In the input, where is that 7 located? Looking at row 2 (third row), columns 4 and 5 have 7s. But the output's first row is [0,0,7]. Maybe the 7 is from row 2, column 4. Then the second row of output is [0,6,8]. The 6 is in row 3, column 3. The 8 is in row 3, column 4. Third row of output is [7,8,4]. The 7 is row 4, column 2. 8 is row 4, column3. 4 is row4, column4. So perhaps the output is taking elements from different positions moving inward. Wait, but how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe each row of the output corresponds to a diagonal in the input. For example, the first row of the output is the first diagonal elements, etc. But that's not clear.\n\nLooking at Example 1's output: [1,0,0], [0,3,6], [0,5,2]. The 1 is from row 1, column1. The 3 is from row2, column2. The 6 is from row2, column3. The 5 is row3, column2. The 2 is row3, column3. The 2 is also in row3, column4. So maybe the output is a 3x3 grid where the (i,j) element is taken from row (i+1), column (j+1) of the input. Let's check for Example 0.\n\nExample 0's output first row: 0,0,7. If i=0, j=0: row1, column1. Input row1 is all zeros. So 0. j=1: row1, column2: 0. j=2: row1, column3:0. No, that doesn't fit. So that's not it.\n\nAnother idea: Maybe the output is the 3x3 grid that starts at the first non-zero row and first non-zero column. For Example 0, the first non-zero row is row2. The first non-zero element in row2 is at column4. So starting at row2, column4, take 3 rows and 3 columns. Let's see:\n\nRow2: columns4,5,6: 7,7,0 \u2192 but output's first row is [0,0,7]. Hmm. Maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is a 3x3 grid taken from the center of the input's non-zero region. For Example 0, the non-zero region is a diamond shape. The center of the diamond is at the midpoint. So rows 4 and 5. Columns 4 and 5. So the center 3x3 would be rows 3,4,5 and columns 3,4,5. Let's check.\n\nRow3: [0,0,0,6,8,8,6,0,0,0] \u2192 columns3-5: 6,8,8 \u2192 but output's second row is [0,6,8]. Wait, maybe the output rows are 3,4,5 and columns 3,4,5. Let's see:\n\nRow3: column3=6, column4=8 \u2192 so row3, columns3-5: 6,8,8 \u2192 output row1 would be [6,8,8], but Example0's output row1 is [0,6,8]. Doesn't fit. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the upper-left 3x3 of the non-zero area. For Example0, the non-zero area starts at row2, column3? Let's see:\n\nRow2: columns4 and5 have 7s. So the first non-zero in row2 is column4. So the upper-left would be row2, column4. Taking 3x3 from there:\n\nRow2: columns4-6: 7,7,0 \u2192 [7,7,0]\nRow3: columns4-6:8,8,6 \u2192 [8,8,6]\nRow4: columns4-6:4,4,8 \u2192 [4,4,8]\nBut the output of Example0 is:\n[0,0,7]\n[0,6,8]\n[7,8,4]\n\nThis doesn't match. So maybe not.\n\nWait, perhaps the output is a 3x3 grid formed by the top-left, top-center, and top-right of certain concentric layers. Alternatively, maybe it's a spiral or some other pattern.\n\nLet me look for another approach. Let's compare the input and output for both examples.\n\nExample0's input has a symmetrical pattern. The output is a 3x3 with 0s and the numbers 7,6,8,4. Looking at the input, the 7s are at rows 2 and 6, columns4-5. The 6s are at rows3 and 5, columns3 and6. The 8s are at rows3-4 and 5-6, columns4-5. The 4s are at rows4-5, columns4-5. The output has 7,8,4 in the third row, which corresponds to the center of the input's pattern.\n\nWait, maybe the output is the central 3x3 of the input. But the input is 10x10, so the central rows and columns would be 4,5,6. Let's check:\n\nFor Example0, rows4,5,6:\n\nRow4: [0,0,7,8,4,4,8,7,0,0]\nRow5: same as row4\nRow6: [0,0,0,6,8,8,6,0,0,0]\n\nColumns4-6 for these rows:\n\nRow4: 4,4,8 \u2192 columns4-6 are 4,4,8\nRow5: same as row4 \u2192 4,4,8\nRow6: columns4-6:8,8,6\n\nBut the output for Example0 is:\n\n[0,0,7]\n[0,6,8]\n[7,8,4]\n\nThis doesn't match. So not the central rows.\n\nAlternative approach: Maybe the output is a 3x3 grid formed by the three middle elements of each of the three middle rows. For example, taking from the middle of each row. For a 10-element row, the middle three elements would be positions 4,5,6 (0-based). Let's check Example0:\n\nRow2 (third row) has elements [0,0,0,0,7,7,0,0,0,0]. Middle three elements (positions4-6) are 7,7,0. But the output's first row is [0,0,7]. Doesn't match.\n\nRow3 (fourth row) has [0,0,0,6,8,8,6,0,0,0]. Middle three:8,8,6 \u2192 output's second row is [0,6,8]. Hmm, not matching.\n\nRow4 has middle three elements 4,4,8. Output's third row is [7,8,4]. Doesn't match.\n\nSo that's not it.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is taking elements from specific positions relative to the first non-zero element in each row. For example, in Example0's row2, the first non-zero is at column4. Then take the next two elements. So row2: 7,7 \u2192 but output's first row is 0,0,7. Not matching.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is a 3x3 grid that starts at the first non-zero element in the third row and spans three rows and three columns. Let's see:\n\nIn Example0's input, the third row (index2) is [0,0,0,0,7,7,0,0,0,0]. The first non-zero here is at column4. So starting at row2, column4, take 3 rows down and 3 columns right:\n\nRow2: 7,7,0\nRow3:8,8,6\nRow4:4,4,8\nBut the output is:\n\n[0,0,7]\n[0,6,8]\n[7,8,4]\n\nDoesn't match. So maybe not.\n\nLooking at Example1's input, the output is:\n\n[1,0,0]\n[0,3,6]\n[0,5,2]\n\nThe 1 in the output is from row1, column1. Then the 3 is row2, column2. 6 is row2, column3. Then 5 is row3, column2. 2 is row3, column3. So this looks like a diagonal pattern. Maybe the output is taking elements from the diagonal and adjacent elements. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is taking the first three non-zero elements from each of the three central rows. For Example0's input:\n\nCentral rows are rows4,5,6.\n\nRow4: 7,8,4,4,8,7 \u2192 first three non-zero are7,8,4 \u2192 but output's third row is7,8,4. That fits. \n\nRow3:6,8,8,6 \u2192 first three non-zero are6,8,8. But output's second row is0,6,8. Hmm, maybe not.\n\nWait, Example0's output has three rows. Let's see:\n\nRow0:0,0,7 \u2192 possibly from row2, which has 7s. But row2's first three non-zero are7,7 (but in positions4 and5). Not sure.\n\nMaybe the output is formed by taking the first three elements of each of the three middle rows, but shifted. This is getting a bit confusing. Let's try to find another approach.\n\nAnother idea: Maybe the output is the 3x3 grid formed by the central elements of the input's non-zero regions. For example, if the input has a symmetrical pattern, the output captures the central 3x3 part of that pattern.\n\nIn Example0's input, the non-zero region forms a diamond shape. The center of the diamond is at rows4-5 and columns4-5. The central 3x3 would include the 4s and surrounding 8s and 7s. Let's check:\n\nRows4,5,6 and columns3,4,5:\n\nRow4: 7,8,4 \u2192 columns2,3,4 (assuming 0-based) are 7,8,4. But row4 is [0,0,7,8,4,4,8,7,0,0]. So columns2,3,4 are 7,8,4. That would match the third row of the output:7,8,4. \n\nRow3: columns3,4,5 are6,8,8 \u2192 which would be the second row of the output:0,6,8. Wait, but the output's second row starts with 0. Where does that 0 come from?\n\nRow2: columns3,4,5 are0,7,7 \u2192 output's first row is0,0,7. So maybe the output is taking columns3,4,5 from rows2,3,4. Let's see:\n\nFor Example0:\n\nRow2: cols3=0, col4=7, col5=7 \u2192 [0,7,7]. Output's first row is [0,0,7]. Not exactly. But maybe it's shifted?\n\nAlternatively, columns4,5,6:\n\nRow2:7,7,0 \u2192 [7,7,0]. Output's first row is [0,0,7]. Doesn't match.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is a rotated or transposed version. Hmm.\n\nAnother angle: Let's think of the input as having a certain structure, and the output is the core of that structure. For example, in Example0, the structure has layers. The outer layer has 7s, then 8s, then 6s, then 4s in the center. The output seems to take the innermost part: the 4s are in the output's third row. So perhaps the output is the innermost 3x3 of the structure.\n\nIn Example0's input:\n\nThe center rows4 and5 have 4,4. The output's third row has4. So maybe the output is capturing three layers: the outermost 7s, then 8s, then 6s and 4s. But how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is the top-left quadrant of the input's central structure. For example, the input has symmetry, and the output takes the top-left 3x3. But not sure.\n\nAnother observation: In both training examples, the output's third row starts with the first non-zero element of the corresponding row in the input. For Example0's third output row [7,8,4], which matches row4 of the input: [0,0,7,8,4,4,8,7,0,0]. The first three non-zero elements are7,8,4. Similarly, in Example1's third output row [0,5,2], which matches row3 of the input: [0,0,5,2,2,6,0,0,0,0]. The first three elements are0,5,2. So perhaps each row of the output is taking the first three elements of a certain row in the input.\n\nLooking at Example0's output:\n\nRow0: [0,0,7] \u2192 perhaps from row2's first three elements: [0,0,0], but no. Or maybe from row2's elements starting at column4:7,7,0. But the output is0,0,7. Not matching.\n\nExample1's output row0 is [1,0,0], which matches row1's first three elements: [0,1,0]. Wait, row1 is [0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0]. First three elements are0,1,0. But output row0 is [1,0,0]. Not matching. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output rows correspond to the input rows where the first non-zero element appears, and then takes the next three elements. For Example0's output row0 is [0,0,7], which could be from row2's elements starting at column3:0,0,7. That would match [0,0,7]. Then row1 of output is [0,6,8] which could be from row3, starting at column3:6,8,8 \u2192 but output is0,6,8. Where does the 0 come from? Unless it's shifted by one column.\n\nWait, maybe the output's row0 is columns4-6 of row2. For Example0's row2: columns4-6 are7,7,0 \u2192 output row0 is0,0,7. Not matching. Alternatively, columns3-5 of row2:0,7,7 \u2192 output row0 is0,0,7. Maybe the output is taking every other element or skipping.\n\nAlternatively, the output is formed by taking the third, fourth, and fifth elements of the third, fourth, and fifth rows. For Example0:\n\nRow2 (third row): elements3-5:0,7,7 \u2192 output row0:0,0,7 (not matching)\nRow3: elements3-5:6,8,8 \u2192 output row1:0,6,8 (maybe the 0 comes from somewhere else)\nRow4: elements3-5:8,4,4 \u2192 output row2:7,8,4 (again, mismatch)\n\nNot matching.\n\nLet me think differently. Maybe the output is a 3x3 matrix where each element is the sum of certain elements in the input. But looking at the numbers, Example0's output has 7, which is present in the input. So probably not sums.\n\nWait, looking at the two examples:\n\nIn Example0's input, the output's third row is [7,8,4]. These numbers appear in the input's row4:7,8,4,4,8,7. So the first three non-zero elements are7,8,4. Similarly, the output's second row is [0,6,8]. The input's row3 has6,8,8. The first non-zero is6, then8, then8. But the output's second row is0,6,8. The 0 might be from the previous elements in that row.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each row in the output is formed by taking the first non-zero element in the input's row, then the next two elements. For example:\n\nExample0's output row0: [0,0,7]. The input's row2 (third row) is all zeros except for two 7s. So the first three elements are0,0,0. But the output is0,0,7. So maybe it's taking the first three elements, but the 7 is the first non-zero. But that doesn't explain it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is the upper-left 3x3 of the input's non-zero elements when they are mirrored. For example, if the input is symmetrical, the output is the upper-left quadrant.\n\nBut Example0's input is symmetrical both vertically and horizontally. The output's third row is7,8,4, which is part of the lower half of the input. So maybe not.\n\nAnother thought: The output could be the top-left 3x3 of the input when the input is rotated 45 degrees. Since the input in Example0 forms a diamond, rotating it 45 degrees would make the diamond into a square. Then taking the top-left 3x3 might give the output. But how to verify that.\n\nAlternatively, think of the input as layers, and the output is the three central layers. But I'm not sure.\n\nLet me look at the Test Input to see if applying a pattern from the examples would work.\n\nThe Test Input is:\n\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n[0,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0]\n[0,0,0,4,4,8,4,0,0,0]\n[0,0,8,8,3,3,4,0,0,0]\n[0,0,0,4,3,3,8,8,0,0]\n[0,0,0,4,8,4,4,0,0,0]\n[0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,0]\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nThe non-zero elements form a sort of pattern. Let's try to find the 3x3 output. Following the pattern from the training examples, perhaps the output is the first three non-zero elements from certain rows.\n\nLooking for the first non-zero rows:\n\nRow2 has an 8 in column5.\n\nRow3 has 4,4,8,4 in columns3-6.\n\nRow4 has8,8,3,3,4.\n\nRow5 has4,3,3,8,8.\n\nRow6 has4,8,4,4.\n\nRow7 has8 in column4.\n\nSo the central structure seems to be around rows3-6 and columns3-7.\n\nIf the pattern from the training examples is to take the first three non-zero elements from three consecutive rows, starting from the first non-zero row, then:\n\nFor the Test Input:\n\nFirst non-zero row is row2 (third row), which has 8 in column5. So the first three elements from row2:0,0,0. But the output likely needs non-zero. Maybe the first row of the output is from row3.\n\nRow3: [0,0,0,4,4,8,4,0,0,0]. First three non-zero are4,4,8. But the output's first row would be [0,4,4] or [4,4,8]. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, if following Example1's pattern where the output is formed by taking elements from the first non-zero row, then the next rows.\n\nIn Example1, the output starts with row1, then row2, then row3. For the Test Input, the first non-zero row is row2 (index2), but maybe the output starts with row3, row4, row5.\n\nRow3: columns3-5:4,4,8 \u2192 perhaps [4,4,8]\n\nRow4: columns2-4:8,8,3 \u2192 [8,8,3]\n\nRow5: columns3-5:4,3,3 \u2192 [4,3,3]\n\nBut the output would be:\n\n[4,4,8]\n[8,8,3]\n[4,3,3]\n\nBut comparing to training examples, Example0's output starts with lower numbers and increases. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the central 3x3 of the non-zero region. For the Test Input, the non-zero region's center is around row5, column5 (value3). Taking rows4-6 and columns4-6:\n\nRow4:3,3,4 \u2192 [3,3,4]\n\nRow5:3,3,8 \u2192 [3,3,8]\n\nRow6:8,4,4 \u2192 [8,4,4]\n\nBut the output would be:\n\n[3,3,4]\n[3,3,8]\n[8,4,4]\n\nWhich doesn't match the structure of the training examples. The training examples' outputs start with lower numbers and have a pattern. For Example0's output, the third row is7,8,4 which is the center of the input's structure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the upper-left part of the non-zero structure. In the Test Input, the non-zero elements start at row2, column5. Taking 3 rows down and 3 columns to the right:\n\nRow2:8,0,0 \u2192 [8,0,0]\n\nRow3:4,4,8 \u2192 [4,4,8]\n\nRow4:8,3,3 \u2192 [8,3,3]\n\nBut output would be:\n\n[8,0,0]\n[4,4,8]\n[8,3,3]\n\nWhich doesn't fit the pattern.\n\nAnother approach: Let's look at the positions of the output elements in the training examples.\n\nFor Example0:\n\nOutput rows are 3x3.\n\nRow0: [0,0,7] \u2192 possible from input row2, columns4,5,6:7,7,0 \u2192 but output is0,0,7. Hmm.\n\nRow1: [0,6,8] \u2192 input row3, columns3,4,5:6,8,8 \u2192 output is0,6,8. Where does the 0 come from?\n\nRow2: [7,8,4] \u2192 input row4, columns2,3,4:7,8,4 \u2192 matches.\n\nSo for the output's third row, it's columns2,3,4 of row4. The second row is columns3,4,5 of row3. The first row is columns4,5,6 of row2. But then the output would be:\n\nRow0:7,7,0 \u2192 but output is0,0,7. Not matching.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each row of the output is shifted left by one. For row0, columns3,4,5 of row2:0,7,7 \u2192 output is0,7,7 \u2192 but the output's first row is0,0,7. Doesn't fit.\n\nThis is getting too confusing. Maybe I need to find a different pattern.\n\nLooking at the two training examples:\n\nExample0's input has a symmetric pattern with layers. The output seems to be capturing the central part, but how?\n\nAnother idea: The output could be the top-left 3x3 of the input when the input is rotated 180 degrees. Let's check Example0:\n\nOriginal input's bottom part becomes the top when rotated. Row7 (which is all zeros) becomes row0. But this seems unlikely.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the first 3x3 non-zero block encountered when scanning the input from the center outward. For Example0, the center has 4s, so the output would include those.\n\nBut I'm not making progress. Let's try to think of the Test Input and what the expected output would be.\n\nThe Test Input's non-zero elements:\n\nRow2: column5 \u2192 8\n\nRow3: columns3,4,5,6 \u21924,4,8,4\n\nRow4: columns2,3,4,5,6 \u21928,8,3,3,4\n\nRow5: columns3,4,5,6,7 \u21924,3,3,8,8\n\nRow6: columns3,4,5,6 \u21924,8,4,4\n\nRow7: column4 \u21928\n\nThe structure seems to have a central cross or something. The highest number is8. The numbers 4,3 are present.\n\nIf the output is the central 3x3 around the highest concentration of numbers, perhaps rows4-6 and columns3-5.\n\nRows4-6:\n\nRow4:8,8,3,3,4 \u2192 columns3-5:3,3,4\n\nRow5:4,3,3,8 \u2192 columns3-5:3,8, something. Wait, row5 is [0,0,0,4,3,3,8,8,0,0]. Columns3-5:4,3,3 \u2192 output row1 would be4,3,3.\n\nRow6: columns3-5:4,8,4 \u2192 output row2 would be4,8,4.\n\nBut that gives:\n\nRow4:3,3,4\n\nRow5:4,3,3\n\nRow6:4,8,4\n\nBut the output would be:\n\n[3,3,4]\n\n[4,3,3]\n\n[4,8,4]\n\nBut this doesn't match the training examples' style.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the first three elements of three consecutive rows that are central. For example, rows3,4,5:\n\nRow3: columns3-5:4,4,8 \u2192 [4,4,8]\n\nRow4: columns3-5:8,3,3 \u2192 [8,3,3]\n\nRow5: columns3-5:4,3,3 \u2192 [4,3,3]\n\nBut the output would be:\n\n[4,4,8]\n\n[8,3,3]\n\n[4,3,3]\n\nWhich also doesn't match the training examples.\n\nAlternatively, looking back at the training examples, the output for Example0 is 3x3 where each row has a zero in the first element except the third row. In Example1, the first row starts with 1, then zeros. Maybe the output is the first occurrence of non-zero elements in each row, moving from the top to the center.\n\nFor the Test Input:\n\nFirst non-zero row is row2:8 in column5. Then row3:4 in column3. Row4:8 in column2. Row5:4 in column3. Row6:4 in column3. Row7:8 in column4.\n\nSo maybe the output is:\n\n[0,0,8] (row2)\n\n[0,4,4] (row3)\n\n[8,8,3] (row4)\n\nBut Example0's output starts with 0s and picks up the first non-zero. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, considering that in Example0's output, the first row comes from row2, the second from row3, third from row4, each taking the first three non-zero elements:\n\nRow2: the first non-zero is at column4 (7). So elements4-6:7,7,0 \u2192 [7,7,0] \u2192 but output is [0,0,7]. Maybe shifted left.\n\nRow3: first non-zero is column3 (6). Elements3-5:6,8,8 \u2192 [6,8,8] \u2192 output row1 is [0,6,8]. Where's the 0 from?\n\nRow4: first non-zero is column2 (7). Elements2-4:7,8,4 \u2192 [7,8,4] \u2192 output row2.\n\nSo the output would be:\n\nRow0: elements4-6 of row2 \u21927,7,0 \u2192 but output is [0,0,7].\n\nHmm. Maybe it's shifted right.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking the first three non-zero elements from each of three consecutive rows, starting from the first row that has a non-zero.\n\nFor the Test Input:\n\nFirst non-zero row is row2. Let's take rows2,3,4.\n\nRow2: elements5 is8. Next non-zero elements are in row3: elements3,4,5:4,4,8. Then row4: elements2,3,4:8,8,3.\n\nSo output would be:\n\nRow0:8 (but need three elements) \u2192 but row2 has only one non-zero. So perhaps this approach doesn't work.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking the three non-zero elements from three different layers of the structure. For example, the outermost layer, middle layer, and innermost layer.\n\nIn Example0, the layers are 7, then 8 and6, then 4. The output has those in each row.\n\nIn the Test Input, the outermost layer might be8, then4 and3. So the output could be:\n\n[0,0,8]\n\n[4,4,8]\n\n[8,3,3]\n\nBut not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the three middle elements of three consecutive rows that are closest to the center.\n\nFor a 10x10 grid, the center is between rows4 and5. Let's look at rows4,5,6.\n\nRow4: [0,0,8,8,3,3,4,0,0,0] \u2192 middle three elements (columns4-6) are3,3,4 \u2192 [3,3,4]\n\nRow5: [0,0,0,4,3,3,8,8,0,0] \u2192 middle three elements (columns4-6) are3,3,8 \u2192 [3,3,8]\n\nRow6: [0,0,0,4,8,4,4,0,0,0] \u2192 middle three elements (columns4-6) are8,4,4 \u2192 [8,4,4]\n\nSo output would be:\n\n[3,3,4]\n\n[3,3,8]\n\n[8,4,4]\n\nBut this doesn't match the training examples' pattern.\n\nI think I'm stuck. Let me try to see if the output for the test input follows the same pattern as the training examples. \n\nLooking at Example0's output, the elements are from the upper part of the input's structure. The first row of the output has a7 which is in the upper part of the diamond. The second row has6 and8 which are in the middle layers. The third row has7,8,4 which are in the lower part. Maybe the output is capturing the upper-left part of the structure when viewed from the top. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the top-left 3x3 of the input's non-zero region after being shifted left and up. For the Test Input, the non-zero region starts at row2, column5. Shifting left by two columns and up by zero rows would give columns3-5 and rows2-4. But that's guesswork.\n\nAlternatively, considering that in both training examples, the output's last row has the highest numbers from the center, maybe the Test Input's output will have the 3,4,8 in the center. For example, the Test Input's row4 has8,8,3,3,4. The center might be around3. So the output's last row could be3,3,4. But I'm not sure.\n\nAfter struggling, I'll make a guess based on the training examples. Both examples have the output as the first three non-zero elements from three consecutive rows starting from the first non-zero row. For Example0, rows2,3,4. For Example1, rows1,2,3. \n\nFor the Test Input, the first non-zero row is row2 (8 in column5). Then rows3,4,5:\n\nRow2: [0,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0] \u2192 first three non-zero:8 (but only one non-zero). So output row0: [0,0,8] ?\n\nRow3: [0,0,0,4,4,8,4,0,0,0] \u2192 first three non-zero:4,4,8 \u2192 output row1: [4,4,8]\n\nRow4: [0,0,8,8,3,3,4,0,0,0] \u2192 first three non-zero:8,8,3 \u2192 output row2: [8,8,3]\n\nBut the output would be:\n\n[0,0,8]\n\n[4,4,8]\n\n[8,8,3]\n\nBut comparing to the training examples, the outputs are structured differently. For instance, Example1's output starts with1,0,0 which is the first non-zero in row1. So maybe the Test Input's output starts with row3,4,5, taking their first three non-zero elements:\n\nRow3: first three non-zero:4,4,8 \u2192 [4,4,8]\n\nRow4:8,8,3 \u2192 [8,8,3]\n\nRow5:4,3,3 \u2192 [4,3,3]\n\nBut then the output would be:\n\n[4,4,8]\n\n[8,8,3]\n\n[4,3,3]\n\nBut this doesn't match the training examples' structure. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is a 3x3 grid where each element is taken from the input's row (starting from the first non-zero row) and the columns are shifted. For example, for Example0, row2's first non-zero is at column4, so the output's first row is column4,5,6. But that's guesswork.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and not finding a clear pattern, I'll make an educated guess based on the training examples. The output seems to be a 3x3 grid taken from the central part of the input, focusing on the first non-zero elements. For the Test Input, perhaps the output is:\n\n[0,0,8]\n\n[0,4,4]\n\n[8,8,3]\n\nBut how does that relate to the training examples? Looking back at Example1's output, the first row is [1,0,0], which comes from row1, column1. The Test Input's first non-zero is row2, column5. So perhaps the output starts there. But this is not conclusive.\n\nAlternatively, considering the symmetry in the input, the Test Input's output might be:\n\n[0,0,8]\n\n[4,4,8]\n\n[8,3,3]\n\nBut I'm not confident. Another approach: Look for a pattern in the training examples' outputs and see if it can be applied.\n\nExample0's output:\n\nRow0:0,0,7\n\nRow1:0,6,8\n\nRow2:7,8,4\n\nExample1's output:\n\nRow0:1,0,0\n\nRow1:0,3,6\n\nRow2:0,5,2\n\nLooking at these, the numbers in the output are from different layers of the input's structure. For Example0, the 7s are in the outer layer, 6 and8 in the middle, and4 in the center. Similarly, in Example1, the 1s are outer, 3 and6 middle, 5 and2 inner. \n\nSo the output is arranged such that each row represents a layer: outermost, middle, innermost.\n\nFor the Test Input:\n\nOuter layer:8s (rows2 and7, column5 and4)\n\nMiddle layer:4s (rows3,6) and8s (row4,5)\n\nInnermost layer:3s (rows4,5)\n\nSo the output might be:\n\nOuter layer:0,0,8\n\nMiddle layer:4,4,8\n\nInnermost layer:3,3, something. \n\nBut not sure. Alternatively, the output rows are taking the first occurrence of each layer's elements.\n\nAlternatively, the output is the three elements from three different layers moving inward.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and not finding a clear pattern, I'll proceed to make a guess based on the training examples and the Test Input's structure. The Test Input's central part has3s and4s. The output may be:\n\n[0,0,8]\n\n[4,4,8]\n\n[8,3,3]\n\nBut I'm not sure. Alternatively, considering the symmetry, perhaps the output is:\n\n[0,4,8]\n\n[4,3,3]\n\n[8,3,8]\n\nBut I'm not confident. \n\nAfter careful consideration, the pattern seems to be taking the first three elements from the first three non-zero rows, but shifted to the right. For the Test Input, the first non-zero rows are row2, row3, row4.\n\nRow2: elements5 is8. The first three non-zero elements would be8 followed by zeros. So output row0: [0,0,8].\n\nRow3: elements3,4,5 are4,4,8 \u2192 output row1: [4,4,8].\n\nRow4: elements2,3,4 are8,8,3 \u2192 output row2: [8,8,3].\n\nSo the output would be:\n\n[0,0,8]\n\n[4,4,8]\n\n[8,8,3]\n\nThis matches the structure of the training examples where the output captures the initial non-zero elements of the first three non-zero rows. For Example0, the first three non-zero rows are rows2,3,4. For Example1, rows1,2,3.\n\nThus, applying this pattern to the Test Input, the output should be:\n\n[0,0,8]\n\n[4,4,8]\n\n[8,8,3]\n\nBut checking the formatting, the training examples use three rows with three elements each. So this would fit."
