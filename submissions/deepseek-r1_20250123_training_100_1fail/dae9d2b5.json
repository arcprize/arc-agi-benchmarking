        "cot_1": "Okay, let's tackle this puzzle. So, we have several input and output examples, and we need to figure out the pattern that transforms the input into the output. Then apply that to the test input. Let's start by carefully analyzing the examples to see if I can spot any patterns.\n\nLooking at the first example, Example 0:\n\nInput:\n[4,4,0,3,3,0]\n[4,0,0,3,0,0]\n[0,0,0,0,0,3]\n\nOutput:\n[6,6,0]\n[6,0,0]\n[0,0,6]\n\nHmm. The input has three rows, each with 6 elements, and the output has three rows with 3 elements each. So the output is half the length of the input. That suggests that maybe each pair of elements in the input is being combined somehow to form the output elements.\n\nLooking at the first input row [4,4,0,3,3,0], the output is [6,6,0]. Let's see how the pairs could combine. The first two elements are 4 and 4, which sum to 8, but the output is 6. Wait, maybe it's not a sum. Alternatively, maybe it's counting the number of non-zero elements in each pair. But 4 and 4 are both non-zero, so that pair would contribute 2, but output is 6. That doesn't fit.\n\nAnother thought: maybe each pair is replaced by 6 if both elements are non-zero, otherwise 0. Let's check. In Example 0's first input row, pairs are (4,4), (0,3), (3,0). The first pair has both non-zero \u2192 6. Second pair: 0 and 3 \u2192 one zero \u2192 0. Third pair: 3 and 0 \u2192 0. So the output would be [6,0,0], but the actual output is [6,6,0]. That doesn't fit. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe it's combining in a different way. Let me look at the output for Example 0 again. The output's first row is [6,6,0]. Let's see the input pairs for the first row: 4,4 | 0,3 | 3,0. If each pair is converted to 6 if the sum is 7 (since 4+3=7 in some examples?), but 4+4=8, 0+3=3, 3+0=3. Not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps each pair is from the input elements in a different way. Let me check the output structure. The output has three elements per row, so maybe each output element is derived from two elements in the input row, but perhaps not consecutive. Maybe first element of output is first and second elements of input, second element is third and fourth, third is fifth and sixth. Let's try that.\n\nIn Example 0's first input row: [4,4,0,3,3,0]. So pairs would be (4,4), (0,3), (3,0). How does that become [6,6,0]? If both numbers are non-zero, then 6. Let's see: (4,4) \u2192 both non-zero \u2192 6. (0,3) \u2192 one zero \u2192 maybe 3, but output is 6 here. That contradicts. Wait in the output it's 6,6,0. So the second pair (0,3) gives 6? Hmm, that doesn't fit my initial thought.\n\nWait maybe it's the count of non-zero in each pair, multiplied by 3. For example, (4,4) has two non-zero \u2192 2*3=6. (0,3) has one non-zero \u2192 1*3=3. But output is 6 here. That doesn't fit. Wait the output for the first row is [6,6,0]. So the second pair gives 6. So that would mean that when either element is non-zero, but that doesn't align.\n\nAlternative approach: Let's check another example. Take Example 1's input and output.\n\nExample 1 Input:\n[4,0,4,3,3,0]\n[4,0,0,3,0,0]\n[0,0,4,3,0,0]\n\nOutput:\n[6,6,6]\n[6,0,0]\n[6,0,6]\n\nLooking at the first input row: [4,0,4,3,3,0]. Split into pairs (4,0), (4,3), (3,0). Output is [6,6,6]. So each pair here converts to 6. But in the first pair, one element is zero. How?\n\nThis suggests that the condition for converting a pair to 6 isn't both non-zero. Maybe it's that at least one is non-zero. But then in Example 0's first row, the third pair (3,0) would convert to 6, but the output is 0. So that can't be.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the sum of the pair. Let's check. For Example 1's first row:\n\n(4+0) =4, (4+3)=7, (3+0)=3. How do these map to 6 each? Maybe if the sum is greater than or equal to some value. But 4,7,3. Not sure.\n\nAnother angle: The numbers 4 and 3 are present in the input. The outputs are 0 and 6. Maybe 4 and 3 are being converted to 6. Let's see. For example, 4 +3 =7, but 6 is the output. Maybe whenever a pair contains both 4 and 3, it becomes 6. But how?\n\nWait, maybe the numbers 4 and 3 are being treated as parts of a group. Like, each 4 and 3 in the input is being summed (4+3=7) but then transformed to 6. Alternatively, perhaps each occurrence of 4 or 3 contributes to the output. Let's see.\n\nLooking at Example 0's input rows:\n\nFirst input row: [4,4,0,3,3,0]. The output is [6,6,0]. Let's see how many 4s and 3s are in each pair. The first pair is 4 and 4 \u2192 two 4s. The second pair is 0 and 3 \u2192 one 3. Third pair is 3 and 0 \u2192 one 3. So the first output element is 6 (sum of 4s?), second 6 (sum of 3?), but 0 and 3 would be 3, but output is 6. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each 4 and 3 in the input is converted to 3 and 3, then summed per pair, and then multiplied by something. Let's test:\n\nOriginal input for Example 0's first row: 4,4,0,3,3,0. Replace 4 with 3 and 3 with 3? Then the pairs would be (3,3) sum 6; (0,3) sum 3; (3,0) sum 3. Then maybe divide by something. But the output is 6,6,0. So perhaps if the sum is 6, then 6. Otherwise, 0. But (0,3) sum 3 would be 0, but output is 6 here. Doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each 4 and 3 is treated as a contribution of 3. For example, each 4 or 3 in the input is worth 3 points. Then, for each pair, sum the points and that's the output.\n\nExample 0's first input row: [4,4,0,3,3,0]. Each 4 and 3 is 3. So the pairs:\n\nPair 1: 4 and 4 \u2192 3+3=6 \u2192 output 6.\n\nPair 2: 0 and 3 \u2192 0+3=3 \u2192 but output is 6. Hmm, that doesn't fit. So maybe if the sum is at least 3, it's 6? But 3 is the sum here. So maybe if the sum is \u22653, output 6. Then 3 would become 6. So in Example 0's second pair (0 and 3), sum is 3 \u2192 6. But the output for that pair is 6. Then the output would be [6,6,6], but the actual output is [6,6,0]. Wait the actual output is [6,6,0]. Third pair is 3 and 0 \u2192 sum 3 \u2192 6. But output is 0. Contradiction.\n\nHmm. Maybe this approach isn't correct. Let's try another example.\n\nLooking at Example 1's output first row: [6,6,6]. The input pairs are (4,0), (4,3), (3,0). Replacing 4 and 3 with 3 each:\n\n(4\u21923, 0\u21920) sum 3 \u2192 6.\n\n(4\u21923,3\u21923) sum 6 \u2192 6.\n\n(3\u21923,0\u21920) sum 3 \u21926. So if sum >=3, output 6. Then all three pairs would be 6, which matches the output. But in Example 0's third pair (3,0) sum is 3, output is 0. So that's conflicting.\n\nWait, Example 0's first row output is [6,6,0]. The third pair is (3,0). If sum is 3, but output is 0. So why is that? Maybe there's another condition. Maybe the positions matter.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is 6 if the pair contains both a 4 and a 3. Let's check.\n\nIn Example 0's first input row, pairs are (4,4) \u2192 no 3s here \u2192 but output is 6. So that can't be.\n\nWait, maybe the sum of 4 and 3 is 7, which is mapped to 6. But 4+4 is 8, which would map to something else. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the count of 4s and 3s in each pair multiplied by a certain factor. Let's see.\n\nExample 0's first input row:\n\nPair 1: two 4s \u2192 count 2 \u2192 2*3=6 \u2192 output 6.\n\nPair 2: one 3 \u2192 count 1 \u2192 1*3=3 \u2192 but output is 6. So that doesn't fit.\n\nWait maybe it's the total number of 4s and 3s in the entire row, but that doesn't seem to fit.\n\nAlternative approach: Let's look at the output elements. All outputs are either 0 or 6, which suggests a binary condition (either 6 or 0). So for each output element, the pair in the input must meet some condition to become 6, else 0.\n\nLooking for the condition that makes a pair become 6.\n\nTake Example 0's first row:\n\nInput pairs (4,4), (0,3), (3,0). Outputs 6,6,0.\n\nSo why is the third pair (3,0) giving 0 when the second pair (0,3) gives 6?\n\nWait, maybe the order matters. Like, the left element is 4 and the right is 3? But in the first pair (4,4), both are 4. So perhaps if the pair has any 4 or 3, then 6. But (0,3) has a 3, so output 6. (3,0) has a 3, but output 0. So that can't be.\n\nWait maybe the pair has to have at least one 4 and at least one 3. No, because (4,4) would have neither 3s. But in Example 0's first pair, the output is 6. So that's not it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the presence of both 4 and 3 in the entire row. But that seems unrelated to the pairs.\n\nWait, looking at the outputs across examples, sometimes the output is 6 even when the pair has a 0 and a 3. For example, in Example 0's second pair (0,3) \u2192 output 6. But in the third pair (3,0) \u2192 output 0. That's inconsistent. So perhaps there's a direction involved. Like, the first element of the pair is 4 and the second is 3. Let's check.\n\nIn Example 0's first input row:\n\nPair 1: (4,4) \u2192 both 4 \u2192 maybe counts as 6.\n\nPair 2: (0,3) \u2192 0 and 3 \u2192 maybe if the second is 3, it's 6.\n\nPair 3: (3,0) \u2192 3 and 0 \u2192 output 0.\n\nSo the condition might be that either the pair is (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), or if the second element is 3 (but that doesn't explain why (0,3) gives 6 and (3,0) gives 0).\n\nAlternatively, the sum of the two elements in the pair equals 7 (since 4+3=7) or 8 (4+4=8). Let's see:\n\nExample 0's first pair sum is 8 (4+4). Output is 6.\n\nSecond pair sum is 3 (0+3). Output is 6.\n\nThird pair sum is 3 (3+0). Output is 0. Hmm, that doesn't align.\n\nWait maybe if the sum is a multiple of 7. 8 isn't, 3 isn't. So that's not it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each 4 is worth 3 and each 3 is worth 3, then sum the pair. So for a pair (4,4), sum is 6 (3+3), so output 6. For (0,3), sum is 3 (0 +3), but output is 6. That's confusing. Then maybe if the sum is >=3, output 6. So (0,3) sum 3 \u2192 6, (3,0) sum 3 \u2192 6. But in Example 0's output, the third pair gives 0, which contradicts. So this approach is not working.\n\nAlternative idea: Maybe the pairs are being treated as a left and right side. For example, the input rows have 6 elements, which could be split into two halves of 3 elements each. Then, each output element is the sum of elements from the left and right halves. But how?\n\nFor Example 0's first input row: [4,4,0,3,3,0]. Split into left [4,4,0] and right [3,3,0]. Sum each corresponding element: 4+3=7, 4+3=7, 0+0=0. Then maybe 7 mod 6 =1? Not sure. The output is [6,6,0], which doesn't align.\n\nAnother angle: The outputs are all multiples of 6, which suggests combining two numbers (like 3 and 3, 4 and 2, etc.). But 4 and 3 sum to 7, but how does that become 6? Maybe modulo 6? 7 mod6=1. Not helpful.\n\nWait, maybe the output is 6 if either element in the pair is non-zero, but then why in some cases pairs with non-zero elements output 0.\n\nAlternatively, consider that the numbers 4 and 3 in the input are converted to 6 in the output when they are adjacent in certain ways. For example, in Example 0's first row, the first two 4s become 6, then the next pair (0,3) becomes 6, but third pair (3,0) becomes 0. Not sure.\n\nLooking at Example 3's input:\n\nInput row: [4,4,0,3,0,0]. Output row: [6,6,0]. The pairs would be (4,4), (0,3), (0,0). So first pair 4+4=8 \u2192 output 6. Second pair 0+3=3 \u2192 output 6. Third pair 0 \u2192 output 0. So how?\n\nAnother thought: Maybe the output is 6 for each pair that has at least one 4 or 3, but only if they are in a certain position. For example, in Example 0's first row, the third pair is (3,0), but output is 0. Hmm. So why isn't that 6?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the first three elements of the input row are one part and the last three are another. Like, for each output element, we take two elements from the input row, but not necessarily consecutive. For example, the first output element could be the sum of elements 0 and 3 (indices starting at 0), the second element sum of 1 and 4, and third sum of 2 and 5. Let's try that for Example 0:\n\nFirst row input: elements 0:4, 3:3 \u2192 4+3=7. Second:1:4,4:3 \u21924+3=7. Third:2:0,5:0 \u21920. So output would be [7,7,0]. But the output is [6,6,0]. Hmm, but 7 mod 6=1. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, multiply instead of add. 4*3=12. 12 mod 6=0. Not helpful.\n\nWait, looking at the outputs, all are multiples of 6, which suggests that the sum is divided by something, but 6 is a common denominator. Another idea: Each 4 and 3 is considered as contributing 3 points each. So a 4 counts as 3, a 3 counts as 3, and others count as 0. Then for each pair, sum the points. If the sum is \u22653, output 6; else 0.\n\nLet's test this hypothesis with Example 0's first input row:\n\nPairs:\n\n(4,4): 3+3=6 \u2192 output 6.\n\n(0,3): 0+3=3 \u2192 sum is 3, which is \u22653 \u2192 output 6.\n\n(3,0):3+0=3 \u2192 sum \u22653 \u2192 output 6. But the actual output is [6,6,0]. So third pair should be 6, but the output is 0. Contradicts. So this can't be right.\n\nWait, perhaps the pair's sum must be exactly 6. For example, (4,4) \u2192 3+3=6 \u2192 yes. (0,3) \u2192 0+3=3 \u2192 no. But output is 6. So that's not it.\n\nAlternative approach: Let's think of each input row as two groups. For example, the first three elements and the next three. Maybe each output element is formed by combining elements from the first and second groups. Let's see.\n\nIn Example 0's first input row: [4,4,0 | 3,3,0]. The output is [6,6,0]. Let's see:\n\nFirst output element: 4 (from first group) and 3 (from second group). 4+3=7 \u2192 6? Maybe 7 mod something. 7-1=6. Not sure.\n\nSecond output element: 4 (first group) and 3 (second group). 4+3=7 \u21926.\n\nThird output element: 0 (first) and 0 (second) \u21920. So output [6,6,0]. Which matches.\n\nSimilarly, let's check Example 1's first input row: [4,0,4 |3,3,0]. Output is [6,6,6].\n\nCombining first group's 4,0,4 with second group's 3,3,0.\n\nFirst element: 4+3=7 \u21926.\n\nSecond element: 0+3=3 \u2192 maybe 3 becomes 6?\n\nThird element:4+0=4 \u2192 how does that become 6?\n\nHmm, this doesn't align. So in Example 1's third output element is 6, but according to this method, it would be 4+0=4 \u2192 4 mod something?\n\nThis approach might work for Example 0 but not others. Let's check Example 3.\n\nExample 3's input first row: [4,4,0 |3,0,0]. Output [6,6,0].\n\nFirst element 4+3=7 \u21926.\n\nSecond element 4+0=4 \u21926? Not sure.\n\nThird element 0+0=0 \u21920.\n\nBut the output is [6,6,0]. So if 4+3=7 \u21926, 4+0=4 \u21926, then perhaps the sum is converted by subtracting 1. 7-1=6, 4+2=6? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each element in the first group is paired with the corresponding element in the second group, and if both are non-zero, output 6. Let's see:\n\nExample 0's first input row:\n\n4 (first group) paired with 3 (second group) \u2192 both non-zero \u21926.\n\n4 paired with3 \u21926.\n\n0 paired with0 \u21920. So output [6,6,0]. Which matches.\n\nExample 1's first input row:\n\n4 paired with3 \u2192 both non-zero \u21926.\n\n0 paired with3 \u2192 one non-zero \u21920? But output is 6.\n\nWait no, according to this condition, only pairs where both are non-zero would become 6. But in Example 1's first input row, the second pair is 0 and 3 \u2192 one is zero. So output should be 0. But in the example, the output is [6,6,6]. So this can't be.\n\nHmm. Let's re-examine Example 1's output. The input is:\n\n[4,0,4,3,3,0]\n[4,0,0,3,0,0]\n[0,0,4,3,0,0]\n\nThe output is:\n\n[6,6,6]\n[6,0,0]\n[6,0,6]\n\nFor the first row's output to be [6,6,6], each pair must be both non-zero. Let's look at the input pairs:\n\nFirst group is [4,0,4], second group [3,3,0].\n\nPairing first group's elements with second group's:\n\n4 & 3 \u2192 both non-zero \u21926.\n\n0 &3 \u2192 one is zero \u2192 but output is 6 here. So this contradicts the previous condition.\n\nAlternatively, maybe if either element is non-zero, output 6. But then in Example 0's third pair (3,0), output would be 6, but it's 0. So that's not it.\n\nWait, maybe the first group and second group are being merged by summing each element, but if the sum is >=4, then 6. Let's see.\n\nExample 0's first row pairs:\n\n4+3=7 \u21926.\n\n4+3=7 \u21926.\n\n0+0=0 \u21920. Which matches the output.\n\nExample 1's first row:\n\n4+3=7 \u21926.\n\n0+3=3 \u2192 sum is 3, which is less than 4 \u2192 output 0. But the output is 6. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternative idea: The input numbers 4 and 3 are being treated as 3 each. So 4\u21923, 3\u21923. Then sum each pair. If the sum is 6, output 6. Otherwise, output 0.\n\nLet's check Example 0's first input row:\n\nOriginal pairs: (4,4), (0,3), (3,0).\n\nConverted to 3 each:\n\n(3,3) sum 6 \u21926.\n\n(0,3) sum 3 \u21920.\n\n(3,0) sum3\u21920. But output is [6,6,0]. So this doesn't fit.\n\nBut in the output, the second element is 6. So this approach isn't correct.\n\nWait, maybe the sum of the pair is 7, and that's converted to 6. For example, 4+3=7 \u21926. 4+4=8 \u21926? How?\n\nBut in Example 0's first pair (4+4=8) \u2192 output 6. Second pair (0+3=3) \u2192 output 6. Third pair (3+0=3) \u2192 output 0. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAnother angle: The output elements correspond to the number of 4s and 3s in each pair, multiplied by 3. For example, each 4 or 3 counts as 1, sum them, multiply by 3. Let's test.\n\nExample 0's first pair (4,4): two 4s \u2192 sum 2 \u21922*3=6 \u21926.\n\nSecond pair (0,3): one 3 \u2192 sum 1 \u21923 \u21923. But output is 6. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, sum the number of 4s and 3s in each pair. If the sum is 2 \u21926, sum 1\u21923. But output has 6s and 0s. Not matching.\n\nWait, looking at the output again, all outputs are either 0 or 6. So perhaps the condition is that the pair contains at least two 4s and/or 3s. For example:\n\nIf a pair has two numbers (each can be 4 or 3), then output 6. Otherwise 0.\n\nBut in Example 0's first pair (4,4) \u2192 two 4s \u21926. Second pair (0,3) \u2192 one 3 \u21920. But output is 6. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, any occurrence of 4 or 3 in the pair, regardless of count, results in 6. But then (0,3) would be 6, (3,0) would be 6. But in Example 0's output, third pair is 0.\n\nThis is getting frustrating. Let's try a different example to see if I can find a pattern.\n\nExample 2's input:\n\n[0,0,4,0,3,0]\n[0,4,4,3,0,3]\n[4,4,0,0,0,3]\n\nOutput:\n\n[0,6,6]\n[6,6,6]\n[6,6,6]\n\nLooking at the first input row: [0,0,4,0,3,0]. Split into pairs (0,0), (4,0), (3,0). Output is [0,6,6]. So first pair (0,0) \u21920. Second pair (4,0) \u21926. Third pair (3,0)\u21926.\n\nHmm. Why do the second and third pairs become 6 even though they each have only one non-zero element?\n\nMaybe the rule is that if either element of the pair is a 4 or 3, then output 6. But in Example 0's third pair (3,0), the output is 0. So that contradicts.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's the presence of a 4 or 3 in the pair, but the 3 must be in the second position. For example:\n\nIf the pair has a 4 in the first position or a 3 in the second position, then output 6.\n\nLet's test this:\n\nExample 0's first pair (4,4) \u21924 in first \u21926.\n\nSecond pair (0,3) \u21923 in second \u21926.\n\nThird pair (3,0) \u21923 in first \u21926. But output is 0. So no.\n\nAlternatively, 4 in the first or 3 in the second. But third pair has 3 in first \u2192 no. So output 0. That would fit.\n\nExample 0's first pair: 4 in first \u21926.\n\nSecond pair:3 in second \u21926.\n\nThird pair:3 in first \u2192 no, 3 is not 4. So output 0. That matches Example 0.\n\nExample 2's first input row:\n\nPairs (0,0) \u2192 no. (4,0) \u21924 in first \u21926. (3,0) \u21923 in first \u2192 no. So output would be [0,6,0], but actual output is [0,6,6]. So that doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. Another idea: The pair is transformed to 6 if there is a 4 in the first element or a 3 in the second element.\n\nExample 0's first pair:4 in first \u21926.\n\nSecond pair:3 in second \u21926.\n\nThird pair:3 in first (but not 4) and 0 in second \u2192 no. Output 0. This fits.\n\nExample 2's first input row: pairs are (0,0) \u2192 no. (4,0) \u21924 in first \u21926. (3,0) \u21923 in first \u2192 no. So output would be [0,6,0], but actual output is [0,6,6]. So this doesn't fit. So the third pair's output is 6, but according to this rule it would be 0. So this can't be.\n\nBut the actual output for Example 2's first row is [0,6,6]. The third pair is (3,0). So why is that 6? According to the previous rule, it wouldn't.\n\nAnother angle: Perhaps each 4 and 3 in the input is converted to 6 in the output, but the position is split into pairs, and if any element in the pair is 4 or 3, then the output is 6. But then why in Example 0's third pair (3,0), which has a 3, output is 0.\n\nAlternatively, the pair is converted to 6 if either element is a 4, but 3s are treated differently. Maybe 3s only contribute if they are in certain positions.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Let's try to find another pattern.\n\nLooking at the output rows, each output row is three elements. Input rows are six elements. So each output element corresponds to two input elements, perhaps summed in a certain way.\n\nBut considering that 4 and 3 are the only non-zero elements, and the outputs are 0 or 6, perhaps each pair's non-zero elements are summed and multiplied by 3, but only if the sum is 2.\n\nWait, for Example 0's first pair (4,4): sum of non-zero elements is 2 (since two elements), 2 *3=6.\n\nSecond pair (0,3): one non-zero \u21921*3=3. But output is 6. Doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, if the pair has any non-zero elements, output 6. But Example 0's third pair (3,0) has a non-zero element, but output is 0. So that's not it.\n\nAlternative approach: Let's look at the positions of the numbers. Maybe each output element is derived from the input elements in a different way. For example, each output element in position i is derived from input elements i and i+3. Because the input has six elements, and the output has three, this would make sense.\n\nLet's test this for Example 0:\n\nInput row 0: [4,4,0,3,3,0].\n\nOutput row: [6,6,0].\n\nSo output elements are:\n\nelement 0: input[0] (4) and input[3] (3) \u2192 4 and 3.\n\nelement 1: input[1] (4) and input[4] (3) \u21924 and3.\n\nelement 2: input[2] (0) and input[5] (0) \u21920 and0.\n\nNow, how do 4 and 3 combine to 6?\n\n4 +3 =7 \u2192 perhaps 7-1=6.\n\n4+3=7 \u21926.\n\n0+0=0.\n\nWhich matches the output [6,6,0].\n\nExample 1's first input row: [4,0,4,3,3,0].\n\nOutput is [6,6,6].\n\nElements:\n\n0:4 (input[0]) +3 (input[3])=7\u21926.\n\n1:0+3=3\u21926? How?\n\nWait, according to this pattern, if the sum is 7, then 6. But 0+3=3, which would not be 6. But the output is 6 here.\n\nThis suggests that the sum is not directly the factor. Maybe it's the presence of both 4 and 3 in the pair.\n\nSo, for each pair formed by input[i] and input[i+3], if the pair contains a 4 and a 3, then output 6. Otherwise, output 0. But how about pairs with two 4s or two 3s?\n\nIn Example 0's first pair (4,3) \u2192 4 and3 \u21926.\n\nSecond pair (4,3) \u21926.\n\nThird pair (0,0)\u21920.\n\nOutput matches.\n\nIn Example 1's first input row:\n\nelement 0:4 and3 \u21926.\n\nelement 1:0 and3 \u21920 and3 \u2192 but output is 6. So this doesn't fit.\n\nWait, this suggests that the presence of 3 in the second part (input[i+3]) would also contribute. But how?\n\nAlternatively, the output is 6 if either element is a 4 or a 3. So for input[i] and input[i+3], if either is 4 or 3, then 6. Otherwise 0.\n\nTesting Example 0's first pair: 4 and3 \u2192 both are 4 or3 \u21926.\n\nExample 0's second pair:4 (4) and3 \u21926.\n\nThird pair:0 and0 \u21920.\n\nOutput [6,6,0]. Correct.\n\nExample 1's first input row:\n\nelement0:4 and3 \u21926.\n\nelement1:0 and3 \u21923 \u21926.\n\nelement2:4 and0 \u21924 \u21926.\n\nSo output [6,6,6]. Which matches.\n\nExample 2's first input row:\n\n[0,0,4,0,3,0]\n\nelement0:0 and0 \u21920.\n\nelement1:0 and3 \u21923 \u21926.\n\nelement2:4 and0 \u21924 \u21926.\n\nOutput [0,6,6]. Which matches.\n\nExample3's first input row:\n\n[4,4,0,3,0,0]\n\nelement0:4 and3 \u21926.\n\nelement1:4 and0 \u21924 \u21926.\n\nelement2:0 and0 \u21920.\n\nOutput [6,6,0]. Correct.\n\nExample4's first input row:\n\n[0,0,0,0,3,0]\n\nelement0:0 and0 \u21920.\n\nelement1:0 and3 \u21926.\n\nelement2:0 and0 \u21920.\n\nOutput [0,6,0]. Which matches the first row of Example4's output.\n\nYes! This seems to fit. So the pattern is: for each row in the input, split into two halves. For each position i (0,1,2) in the first half, pair it with the i-th position in the second half. If either element in the pair is 4 or 3, the output is 6; otherwise 0.\n\nSo the rule is: For each pair of elements formed by the i-th element of the first three elements and the i-th element of the last three elements in the input row, if either element is 4 or 3, output 6 for that position; otherwise 0.\n\nLet me verify this with all examples.\n\nExample0:\n\nInput rows:\n\nFirst row: [4,4,0,3,3,0]\n\nPairs for output:\n\n(4,3), (4,3), (0,0). All but last pair have 4 or 3 \u2192 output [6,6,0]. Correct.\n\nExample1:\n\nFirst input row: [4,0,4,3,3,0]\n\nPairs: (4,3), (0,3), (4,0). All pairs have at least one 4 or3 \u2192 output [6,6,6]. Correct.\n\nExample2:\n\nFirst input row: [0,0,4,0,3,0]\n\nPairs: (0,0), (0,3), (4,0). Second and third pairs have 3 or4 \u2192 output [0,6,6]. Correct.\n\nExample3:\n\nFirst input row: [4,4,0,3,0,0]\n\nPairs: (4,3), (4,0), (0,0) \u2192 first two have 4 \u2192 output [6,6,0]. Correct.\n\nExample4:\n\nFirst input row: [0,0,0,0,3,0]\n\nPairs: (0,0), (0,3), (0,0) \u2192 second has 3 \u2192 output [0,6,0]. Correct.\n\nNow, let's apply this to the test input:\n\nTest Input:\n[0,4,4,3,0,0]\n[4,0,0,3,3,0]\n[0,4,0,3,0,0]\n\nLet's process each row:\n\nFirst row: [0,4,4,3,0,0]\n\nSplit into first three [0,4,4] and last three [3,0,0].\n\nPairs:\n\n0 &3 \u2192 0 and3 \u21923 is present \u21926.\n\n4 &0 \u21924 is present \u21926.\n\n4 &0 \u21924 is present \u21926.\n\nSo output for first row: [6,6,6].\n\nSecond row: [4,0,0,3,3,0]\n\nFirst three: [4,0,0], last three: [3,3,0].\n\nPairs:\n\n4 &3 \u21926.\n\n0 &3 \u21923 \u21926.\n\n0 &0 \u21920.\n\nOutput: [6,6,0].\n\nThird row: [0,4,0,3,0,0]\n\nFirst three: [0,4,0], last three: [3,0,0].\n\nPairs:\n\n0 &3 \u21923 \u21926.\n\n4 &0 \u21924 \u21926.\n\n0 &0 \u21920.\n\nOutput: [6,6,0].\n\nSo the final output should be:\n\n[6,6,6]\n\n[6,6,0]\n\n[6,6,0]\n\nBut wait, looking at the training examples, each output row has three elements. Let's confirm.\n\nYes. So the test input's output should be:\n\n[6,6,6]\n\n[6,6,0]\n\n[6,6,0]\n\nBut let me double-check:\n\nFirst row: pairs (0,3), (4,0), (4,0). Each has at least one 4 or3 \u2192 all 6.\n\nSecond row: pairs (4,3), (0,3), (0,0). First two are 6, third 0.\n\nThird row: pairs (0,3), (4,0), (0,0). First two are 6, third 0.\n\nYes. So the output would be as above.",

        "cot_2": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. So, the input is a list of three rows, each with six numbers, and the output is three rows with three numbers each. The numbers in the output seem to be 6s and 0s. Hmm, so maybe each group of two numbers in the input is being combined into one number in the output. Let's look at the first example.\n\nTake Example 0:\nInput rows are [4,4,0,3,3,0], [4,0,0,3,0,0], [0,0,0,0,0,3]. The output is [6,6,0], [6,0,0], [0,0,6]. Let's see how each pair becomes a 6 or 0. The first input row is split into three pairs: (4,4), (0,3), (3,0). The output is 6,6,0. Wait, 4+4=8, but output is 6. So maybe it's not a sum. Oh, maybe if the two numbers are the same and non-zero, then they become 6. Let's check. \n\nFirst pair in example 0's first input row: 4 and 4. Both same, non-zero \u2192 6. Second pair 0 and 3: different, so 0? But output here is 6. Wait, that doesn't fit. Wait, the output second element is 6. Wait, original pair is 0 and 3. Hmm, maybe not. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's the count of non-zero elements in each pair? For example, if a pair has two non-zero numbers, maybe it's 6. Or if either is non-zero. Wait, but let's check.\n\nIn Example 0's first input row: [4,4,0,3,3,0]. The pairs are (4,4), (0,3), (3,0). The output is [6,6,0]. So first pair: two non-zero, same \u2192 6. Second pair: 0 and 3. Are they being added? 0+3=3, but output is 6. Hmm, that's not matching. Or maybe it's the sum of each pair multiplied by some factor. 4+4=8, but 6 is 8*0.75. Doesn't make sense. Alternatively, maybe the sum is divided by 2, then multiplied by 3. 4+4=8 \u2192 8/2=4, 4*1.5=6. That works for the first pair. Second pair: 0+3=3 \u2192 3/2=1.5, times 3 would be 4.5, but output is 6. Doesn't fit. So maybe that's not it.\n\nAnother approach: looking at the outputs. All outputs are 6s and 0s. So perhaps each pair in the input is converted to a 6 if some condition is met, else 0. Let's look for conditions.\n\nIn Example 0's first input pair (4,4) becomes 6. Second pair (0,3) becomes 6. Third pair (3,0) becomes 0. Wait, how? Because the third pair in the input is (3,0), which is same as the second pair reversed. But in the output, second element is 6, third is 0. So maybe the order matters. Let's think again.\n\nWait, maybe the pairs are being checked for being non-zero. If both numbers are non-zero, then sum them and multiply by some factor. For example, (4,4) sum 8. 8 times 0.75 is 6. (0,3) sum 3, 3*2=6. But then (3,0) would also be 3, but output is 0. So that doesn't work. Alternatively, maybe if either element is non-zero, but the sum is 6? Wait, 4+4=8, no. 0+3=3, no. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each pair is being converted to 6 if they add up to 7 (since 4+3=7). Let's check. In Example 0, first pair 4+4=8, which isn't 7. So that doesn't fit.\n\nWait, maybe the numbers 4 and 3 are being treated as parts of a clock. Like 4 + 3 = 7, but 7 mod 12 is 7. Not sure. Alternatively, 4 and 3 might represent something else. Wait, 4 and 3 could be the digits that sum to 7, and 7 is represented as 6+1 or something. Not sure.\n\nLooking at another example. Example 1's input:\n\nInput row 0: [4,0,4,3,3,0]. So pairs are (4,0), (4,3), (3,0). Output is [6,6,6]. So first pair (4,0) becomes 6. Second pair (4,3) \u2192 6. Third (3,0) \u21926. How?\n\nHmm, maybe if either of the numbers in the pair is non-zero, it's 6. But then in example 0, the third pair (3,0) would become 6, but output is 0. So that's conflicting.\n\nWait, perhaps it's based on the presence of 4 and 3 in the pair. Let's see. If a pair contains both 4 and 3, then it's 6. Or if it's a 4 and a 4, or 3 and 3. For example:\n\nIn Example 0's first input pair (4,4) \u2192 6. Then (0,3) \u2192 maybe 3 is present. But output is 6. Wait, but in the output, (0,3) becomes 6. But the third pair (3,0) becomes 0. So maybe the order matters. Like, if the left element is 4 or 3, and the right is 3 or 4. Wait, maybe it's the sum. Wait, 4+3=7. But how does that become 6? Maybe 7 mod 6=1. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each pair is converted to 6 if they are either (4,4), (3,3), (4,3), or (3,4). Let's check. \n\nIn Example 0's first input:\n\n- (4,4) \u21926. That fits.\n- (0,3) \u2192 not any of those pairs. But output is 6. So that's a problem.\n\nWait, maybe the pair (0,3) is considered as 3 and 0. But in Example 0's output, that becomes 6. Hmm. Maybe the presence of 3 or 4 in either position, regardless of the other. So if either element is 3 or 4, then it's 6. But then in Example 0's third pair (3,0) \u21923 is present, so should be 6, but output is 0. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the numbers 4 and 3 are mapped to 3 and 4 respectively, then summed. But 4 becomes 3, 3 becomes 4. Then sum would be 3+3=6 for (4,4). So that gives 6. For (0,3), 0 remains 0 and 3 becomes 4. Sum is 4. Not 6. So that doesn't fit.\n\nWait, maybe 4 and 3 are being treated as their positions in the alphabet. D is 4, C is 3. But D + D would be 4+4=8, which doesn't help. Alternatively, their product: 4*4=16, but how does that become 6?\n\nAlternatively, the numbers 4 and 3 could relate to 6 in some way. 4 + 3 = 7, but 7-1=6. Not sure. Maybe each 4 and 3 in the pair contribute to a count. For example, each 4 counts as 1.5, each 3 as 1. So (4,4) \u21923 \u21923*2=6. (0,3) \u21921 \u21921*6=6. But (3,0) would be 1 \u21926, but in Example 0's output, the third element is 0. Hmm, not matching.\n\nWait, looking at the outputs again. For Example 0's first row input [4,4,0,3,3,0], output is [6,6,0]. The pairs are (4,4), (0,3), (3,0). The output is 6,6,0. So why does the third pair (3,0) become 0?\n\nWait, maybe the direction matters. If the pair is (a, b), then if a is 4 or 3 and b is 4 or 3, then sum a and b. If their sum is 7 (4+3) or 8 (4+4) or 6 (3+3), then convert to 6. Wait:\n\nIn the first pair, 4+4=8 \u21926?\n\nIn the second pair, 0+3=3 \u2192 how does that become 6?\n\nHmm, not sure. Let's look at another example. Example 1's first input row: [4,0,4,3,3,0]. Output is [6,6,6]. The pairs here are (4,0), (4,3), (3,0). So each of these pairs becomes 6. How?\n\nWait, maybe whenever there's a 4 or a 3 in either position of the pair, it's a 6. But then in Example 0's third pair (3,0), which has a 3, why is it 0? That contradicts.\n\nAlternatively, maybe if the pair contains both 4 and 3 (in any order), it's 6. If both are 4, it's 6. Both are 3, it's 6. Otherwise, 0. Let's test this.\n\nExample 0's first row: (4,4) \u21926. (0,3) \u21920 (since not both 4/3). But output is 6. So that's no.\n\nHmm. Another angle: the output has the same number of 6s as the number of pairs in the input that meet a certain condition.\n\nWait, let's count the number of 6s in each output row and compare to input. For example, Example 0's output row 0 has two 6s and one 0. The input row has three pairs. So maybe two of those pairs meet the condition.\n\nBut how to determine which condition.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each pair's elements are multiplied, and if the product is non-zero, it's 6. Otherwise 0. Let's see.\n\nExample 0's first pair: 4*4=16 \u21926? 16 mod 10 is 6. Hmm, but 0*3=0, which would be 0, but output is 6. So that's not right.\n\nAlternatively, if the product is 12 (4*3) or 16 (4*4) or 9 (3*3). But 12, 16, 9 don't directly relate to 6.\n\nAlternatively, the product divided by something. 4*4=16 \u219216/ (something) =6. 16/ (8/3) \u22486. Not sure.\n\nAnother idea: the numbers 4 and 3 could represent binary bits. 4 is 100, 3 is 011. But not sure how that leads to 6.\n\nWait, 4 +3=7. 7 in binary is 111. But 6 is 110. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, think of 4 and 3 as positions in a grid. Like, each pair represents coordinates, but that's a stretch.\n\nLet me look at Example 3's input and output.\n\nExample 3's input row 0: [4,4,0,3,0,0]. Output is [6,6,0]. The pairs are (4,4), (0,3), (0,0). So first pair becomes 6, second 6, third 0. So (0,3) becomes 6 again. But (0,3) is the same as in Example 0's second pair, which also becomes 6.\n\nIn Example 0's third pair (3,0) becomes 0. So the order matters. Because (0,3) is 6, but (3,0) is 0. That's a key observation. So the order of the pair is crucial.\n\nSo if the pair is (a, b), then the output is 6 if a is non-zero and b is non-zero, but only if one of them is 4 and the other is 3? Wait, no. For Example 0's first pair (4,4), which becomes 6. So both are 4, same numbers. So maybe when the two numbers are the same and non-zero, they sum to 8 (4+4) which becomes 6. But how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each pair is being converted to 6 if the sum is 7 or 8 (since 4+3=7, 4+4=8, 3+3=6). Wait, in that case:\n\n- (4,4) sum 8 \u21926?\n- (3,3) sum 6 \u21926?\n- (4,3) sum7 \u21926?\n- (0,3) sum3 \u21920?\nBut in Example 0's second pair (0,3) sum 3, but output is 6. So that doesn't fit.\n\nWait, maybe it's the presence of at least one 4 or 3. But (0,3) would have a 3, so becomes 6. But (3,0) also has a 3, but becomes 0. So order matters.\n\nAlternatively, the first element of the pair is non-zero. So if the first element is 4 or 3, and the second is also non-zero (could be any number?), then output 6. Otherwise 0. Let's check.\n\nExample 0's first pair (4,4): first is 4 (non-zero), second 4 (non-zero) \u21926. Second pair (0,3): first is 0 \u2192 no, but output is 6. So that doesn't fit.\n\nWait, but maybe the first element is the one that determines whether to add 3 and the second to add 3. Like, each 4 is treated as 3 and each 3 as 3. So (4,4) would be 3+3=6. (0,3) is 0+3=3 \u2192 but output is 6. Hmm, not quite.\n\nAlternatively, each 4 in the pair is replaced with 3, and each 3 remains 3, then sum them. So:\n\n- (4,4) \u21923+3=6 \u21926.\n- (0,3) \u21920+3=3 \u21923, but output is 6. Doesn't fit.\n\nAnother idea: the sum of the two numbers in the pair, but capped at 6. So 4+4=8 \u21926. 3+3=6 \u21926. 4+3=7 \u21926. 0+3=3 \u21923, but output is 6. So that's not it.\n\nLooking back at Example 1's output. The first row of input is [4,0,4,3,3,0], which becomes [6,6,6]. Let's see the pairs:\n\n- (4,0) \u21926. But sum is 4. So if the first element is 4, then 6? Or perhaps any pair where the first element is 4 becomes 6. Then (4,0) is 6. (4,3) is 6. (3,0) would be 6 if the first element is 3, but in Example 0's third pair (3,0) is 0. So maybe only if the first element is 4. But then, in Example 1's third pair (3,0), first element is 3, but output is 6. So that's conflicting.\n\nAlternatively, if either element is 4 or 3, then 6. But then (0,3) would be 6, (3,0) would also be 6. But in Example 0's output, (3,0) is 0. So this isn't right.\n\nWait, maybe the output is 6 for each pair that contains a 4 or 3, but only if they are in certain positions. For example, the first element of the pair is 4 or 3. Let's check:\n\nIn Example 0's first pair (4,4) \u21926 (yes). Second pair (0,3) \u2192 first is 0 \u2192 no, but output is 6. So that's not.\n\nAlternatively, the second element of the pair is 3. If so, then (0,3) would be 6, and (3,0) would be 0. Let's test this.\n\nExample 0's first row:\n\n- (4,4) \u2192 second element is 4 \u2192 not 3 \u2192 but output is 6. So no.\n- (0,3) \u2192 second is 3 \u21926. Output is 6. Third pair (3,0) \u2192 second is 0 \u21920. Which matches the output. \n\nBut then what about the first pair (4,4)? Why is that 6? If the second element is not 3. So this theory only explains two of the three pairs. \n\nAnother observation: in the output, sometimes a pair with a 3 in the second position becomes 6 (like (0,3)), but (3,0) becomes 0. So perhaps the second element being 3 makes the pair 6, regardless of the first. But then (4,3) would be 6 as well. Let's see.\n\nLooking at Example 1's input first row pairs: (4,0), (4,3), (3,0). The output is 6,6,6. According to this theory:\n\n- (4,0) \u2192 second element is 0 \u21920. But output is 6. So that's wrong.\n\nHmm. Maybe there's a different pattern. Let's think about combining two elements into one in the output. Since the input has six elements per row, and output has three, each output element is derived from two input elements. The output is all 6s and 0s. So maybe each pair contributes to a 6 if they meet a condition, else 0.\n\nAnother approach: let's look at all the pairs in the training examples and see what makes them turn into 6 or 0.\n\nLet's list out pairs and their outputs:\n\nFrom Example 0:\n\nInput pairs and output:\n\nRow 0:\n\n(4,4) \u21926\n\n(0,3) \u21926\n\n(3,0) \u21920\n\nRow1:\n\n(4,0) \u21926\n\n(0,3) \u21920\n\n(0,0) \u21920\n\nRow2:\n\n(0,0) \u21920\n\n(0,0) \u21920\n\n(0,3) \u21926\n\nWait, output row 2 is [0,0,6]. So third pair (0,3) \u21926.\n\nWait, in row2 of input example0, the pairs are (0,0), (0,0), (0,3). Output is [0,0,6]. So (0,3) \u21926, others 0.\n\nSo for (0,3) in row0 pair2: output is6.\n\nIn row1, pair (0,3) becomes 0.\n\nWait, that's conflicting. So same pair (0,3) in different rows can have different outputs. So the position in the row must matter. That complicates things.\n\nWait, perhaps the output depends on the entire row, not just the pair. But that would make it harder. Maybe the sum of the entire row's numbers? Let's check.\n\nExample0's input row0 sum:4+4+0+3+3+0=14. Output row0 sum:6+6+0=12. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the number of non-zero elements in the row. Row0 has four non-zero elements (4,4,3,3). Output has two 6s. Hmm, not directly.\n\nAlternatively, the output is formed by grouping the input into pairs and checking if each pair has at least one 4 or 3, but that's not working as per earlier examples.\n\nLet's think of the pairs as columns. Wait, input rows have six elements, which can be seen as three columns of two elements each. For example, in Example0's input:\n\nRow0: [4,4,0,3,3,0] \u2192 pairs (4,4), (0,3), (3,0). But perhaps the columns are arranged vertically. Wait, maybe each pair is a column from three different rows. For example, the first two elements of each row form a column. Then processing columns.\n\nWait, that's a different approach. Let me consider the input as three rows, each with six elements. So each row is divided into three pairs. Then, for each column of pairs across the three rows, sum or process them.\n\nBut the output has three rows and three elements each, so maybe each output element is derived from a column of input pairs.\n\nWait, for example, the first output column would come from the first pair of each input row.\n\nExample0's input:\n\nRow0: [4,4,0,3,3,0]\n\nRow1: [4,0,0,3,0,0]\n\nRow2: [0,0,0,0,0,3]\n\nThe first pairs of each row are (4,4), (4,0), (0,0). These form a column. Maybe sum these pairs in some way. But the output's first column is [6,6,0]. How?\n\nHmm. Alternatively, for each column of pairs, count the number of non-zero pairs and multiply by 6. Or something else.\n\nAlternatively, each pair in the input is converted to 6 if the sum of the pair across all three rows is non-zero. For example, the first pair of each row (4,4), (4,0), (0,0). The sum across these pairs (4+4) + (4+0) + (0+0) = 8 +4 +0 =12. 12/2 =6. So output is 6,6,0? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, for each column of pairs, check if there's a certain pattern. For example, the first column's pairs are (4,4), (4,0), (0,0). Maybe the output for the first column is 6 if any of the pairs in that column meet a condition. But how?\n\nThis approach is getting complicated. Let's think differently. Maybe each pair in the input is transformed into a 6 if the sum of the two numbers is greater than or equal to 3. For example:\n\n(4,4) sum 8 \u21926.\n\n(0,3) sum3 \u21926.\n\n(3,0) sum3 \u21926. But in Example0's third pair output is 0. So that's conflicting.\n\nAlternatively, maybe if the sum is even. (4+4=8 even \u21926. 0+3=3 odd \u21920. But in Example0's second pair, sum is 3, but output is6. So that's no.\n\nAnother idea: the pair is converted to 6 if either element is a 4. So:\n\n(4,4) \u21926.\n\n(0,3) \u2192 no 4 \u21920. But in Example0's output, it's6. So that's not.\n\nWait, maybe if the pair contains at least one 4 and at least one 3. But (4,4) doesn't have a 3. So that's not.\n\nAlternatively, if the pair contains a 4 or a 3, but only if they are in a certain position. For example, the first element is a 4 or the second is a 3. Let's see:\n\nIn Example0's first pair (4,4): first is4 \u21926.\n\nSecond pair (0,3): second is3 \u21926.\n\nThird pair (3,0): first is3 but output is0. So maybe first element is4 or second is3. That would explain the first two pairs. But why third pair is0. The third pair is (3,0), so first element is3, not4. So output 0. So this seems to fit.\n\nLet's test this hypothesis:\n\nRule: For each pair (a,b), output 6 if a=4 OR b=3. Otherwise 0.\n\nCheck Example0's first row:\n\nPairs:\n\n(4,4) \u2192a=4 \u21926. Correct.\n\n(0,3) \u2192b=3 \u21926. Correct.\n\n(3,0) \u2192a\u22604, b\u22603 \u21920. Correct.\n\nExample0's output row0 is [6,6,0]. Which matches.\n\nRow1 of Example0's input: [4,0,0,3,0,0]. Pairs are (4,0), (0,3), (0,0).\n\nFirst pair (4,0): a=4 \u21926. Correct.\n\nSecond pair (0,3): b=3 \u21926. But output is 0. Wait, no. The output for row1 is [6,0,0]. So this contradicts the hypothesis. So this rule is invalid.\n\nHmm, so that doesn't work.\n\nLet's try another approach. Let's look at the sum of all elements in the input and the output. For Example0:\n\nInput row0 sum:4+4+0+3+3+0=14. Output row0 sum:6+6+0=12.\n\nNot sure if related. Example1's input row0 sum:4+0+4+3+3+0=14. Output row0 sum:6+6+6=18. So sum increases. Example0's output sum is 12, which is 14-2. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the output for each row is determined by the positions of 4s and 3s. For example, each 4 and 3 contributes to the output in a certain way.\n\nWait, another observation: in all training examples, the output rows have 6s only where certain pairs in the input are present, and 0s otherwise. Also, the 6s are appearing in positions that might correspond to the presence of certain pairs in the input.\n\nLet me think about the output structure. Each output row has three elements. So for each input row of six elements, divided into three pairs, each pair contributes to one element in the output row. So the first pair in the input row contributes to the first element in the output row, etc.\n\nSo the key is to find what transformation is applied to each pair in the input to get the corresponding output element.\n\nLooking at Example0's first input row:\n\nPairs: (4,4), (0,3), (3,0).\n\nOutput elements: 6,6,0.\n\nSo what's the rule that turns these pairs into 6,6,0.\n\nAnother idea: for each pair (a, b), if a and b are both non-zero and different (i.e., one is 4 and the other is 3), then output 6. If they are the same and non-zero (both 4 or both3), output 6. Otherwise, output 0.\n\nWait:\n\n(4,4): same \u21926.\n\n(0,3): a=0, which is zero \u2192 but output is6. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, if either a or b is non-zero, output 6. But then all pairs with at least one non-zero would be 6. But in Example0's third pair (3,0) \u2192 non-zero, but output is0. So no.\n\nAnother angle: perhaps each 4 in the input is converted to 3 and each 3 to 4, then sum each pair and cap at 6.\n\nFor example:\n\n(4,4) becomes (3,3) sum 6 \u21926.\n\n(0,3) \u2192 (0,4) sum4 \u21924. But output is6. So no.\n\nAlternatively, sum the pair and if the sum is >=4, output 6. Otherwise 0.\n\n(4,4) sum8 \u21926.\n\n(0,3) sum3 \u21920. But output is6. No.\n\nHmm.\n\nLet me look at another example. Example2's input:\n\nRow0: [0,0,4,0,3,0]\n\nPairs: (0,0), (4,0), (3,0).\n\nOutput row0: [0,6,6].\n\nSo according to this, (0,0) \u21920, (4,0) \u21926, (3,0) \u21926.\n\nIf the first element of the pair is 4 or3, then 6. So (4,0) \u21924 is first \u21926. (3,0) \u21923 is first \u21926. (0,0) \u21920 first \u21920. This seems to fit.\n\nWait, this is a possible pattern. For each pair (a, b), if a is 4 or 3, then output 6. Else 0.\n\nLet's check this with Example0's first row:\n\nPairs:\n\n(4,4) \u2192a=4 \u21926. Correct.\n\n(0,3) \u2192a=0 \u21920. But output is6. So that's a problem.\n\nHmm. So this doesn't work.\n\nWait, perhaps the output is 6 if the first element of the pair is 4, or the second element is3. So:\n\nIf a ==4 OR b ==3 \u21926 else 0.\n\nLet's check Example0's first row:\n\n(4,4) \u2192a=4 \u21926. Correct.\n\n(0,3) \u2192b=3 \u21926. Correct.\n\n(3,0) \u2192neither \u21920. Correct.\n\nYes! This fits.\n\nNow check Example0's row1 input: [4,0,0,3,0,0].\n\nPairs:\n\n(4,0) \u2192a=4 \u21926. Output is6.\n\n(0,3) \u2192b=3 \u21926. But output here is0. Oh, this contradicts. \n\nWait, the output for row1 is [6,0,0]. So according to this rule, second pair (0,3) should be6, but output is0. So this theory is invalid.\n\nHmm, but why does Example0's row1 second pair (0,3) output 0? According to the rule, since b=3, it should be 6. But output is0.\n\nWait, maybe the rule is more complex. Like, for each pair (a,b), output 6 if a is 4 AND b is 4 or 3, OR if a is 3 AND b is 3. Or something like that.\n\nExample0's first row pairs:\n\n(4,4) \u21926.\n\n(0,3) \u2192 a=0 \u21920.\n\n(3,0) \u2192 a=3, but b=0 \u21920.\n\nBut according to this, the output for (0,3) would be0, but the actual output is6. So no.\n\nAlternatively, maybe a and b are summed, and if the sum is 7 or 8, output 6. Because 4+3=7, 4+4=8, 3+3=6. So 7 and 8 become 6. But then (0,3) sum3 \u21920, but output is6. So no.\n\nAlternatively, the sum of a and b, multiplied by something. For example, 4+4=8 \u21928*0.75=6. 0+3=3 \u21923*2=6. 3+0=3 \u21923*0=0. So this fits Example0's first row.\n\nThen for Example0's row1:\n\nPairs:\n\n(4,0) \u21924+0=4 \u21924*1.5=6.\n\n(0,3) \u21920+3=3 \u21923*2=6. But output is0. So this doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. So that's not consistent.\n\nLet's try to find another pattern. Maybe each pair is considered as a two-digit number, and if it's divisible by 7, then output 6. For example, 44 \u219244/7 is 6.28, so not divisible. 03 is 3 \u21923/7 no. 30 \u219230/7 no. So that's not working.\n\nAnother idea: maybe the output is 6 for each pair where the sum of the two elements is a multiple of 7. 4+3=7 \u21926. 4+4=8 \u21928-7=1 \u2192 no. 3+3=6 \u21926. So in that case, (4,3) sum7 \u21926. (3,3) sum6 \u21926. (4,4) sum8 \u2192 not. But Example0's first pair (4,4) output is6. So this is not matching.\n\nThis is getting frustrating. Let's look at Example1's output:\n\nExample1's input row0: [4,0,4,3,3,0]\n\nPairs: (4,0), (4,3), (3,0). Output is6,6,6.\n\nAccording to the previous theory (a=4 or b=3), (4,0) \u2192a=4 \u21926. (4,3) \u2192a=4 \u21926. (3,0) \u2192a=3 \u21926. But according to this, all three would be6, which matches the output.\n\nBut in Example0's row1, the pair (0,3) would be b=3 \u21926, but output is0. So why the discrepancy?\n\nAh, maybe the rule depends on the row's position. For example, in the first row of the input, the pairs are transformed one way, and in other rows another way. But that seems too complex.\n\nWait, but looking at Example0's input row1: [4,0,0,3,0,0]. Pairs are (4,0), (0,3), (0,0). Output is [6,0,0]. So according to the a=4 or b=3 rule:\n\nFirst pair: a=4 \u21926.\n\nSecond pair: b=3 \u21926. But output is0.\n\nThird pair: neither \u21920.\n\nSo why the second pair is 0 in output?\n\nIs there a different pattern when the pair is in a different row? Maybe the transformation depends on the vertical position. For example, pairs in the first row use one rule, pairs in the second row use another rule, etc. But that complicates things.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is: for each pair (a, b), output 6 if a is 4 OR b is 3, but only if the other element is not zero. Let's test this.\n\nFor Example0's first row pair (0,3): a=0, b=3. The other element is0 (since a is0). So no. But output is6. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, output 6 if a is 4 and b is non-zero, or b is3 and a is non-zero. \n\nExample0's first pair (4,4): a=4 and b non-zero \u21926.\n\nSecond pair (0,3): b=3 and a=0 \u2192a is zero \u2192 no. But output is6. So that doesn't work.\n\nAnother Idea: Maybe the pair is transformed based on the sum of the two elements, with certain sums mapping to 6. For example:\n\nSum 4+4=8 \u21926.\n\nSum 4+3=7 \u21926.\n\nSum 3+3=6 \u21926.\n\nSum 0+3=3 \u21920.\n\nSum 3+0=3 \u21920.\n\nSum 4+0=4 \u21920.\n\nWait, but in Example0's second pair (0,3) sum3 \u21920, but output is6. So this is conflicting.\n\nAnother observation: looking at Example4's output. Input row0: [0,0,0,0,3,0] becomes [0,6,0]. Pairs are (0,0), (0,0), (3,0). Output is 0,6,0. So the middle pair is (0,0) \u21920. The third pair (3,0) \u21920. But the middle output is6. That's confusing.\n\nWait, Example4's input row0 is [0,0,0,0,3,0]. So pairs are (0,0), (0,0), (3,0). The output is [0,6,0]. So why the middle element is6?\n\nThis suggests that the middle pair is (0,0) which outputs 6. But according to previous examples, pairs of (0,0) output 0. But here, output is6. So this breaks any previous pattern.\n\nThis is really challenging. Let's try a different approach. Perhaps the transformation is not per pair but per column across the three rows. For example, the output is generated by combining the three rows' pairs in some way.\n\nEach output element could be derived from the corresponding column of pairs across all three rows.\n\nFor example, output[i][j] is determined by the three pairs in input rows at column j.\n\nLet's look at Example0:\n\nInput rows:\n\nRow0: [4,4,0,3,3,0]\n\nRow1: [4,0,0,3,0,0]\n\nRow2: [0,0,0,0,0,3]\n\nEach column of pairs:\n\nColumn0:\n\nRow0: (4,4)\n\nRow1: (4,0)\n\nRow2: (0,0)\n\nColumn1:\n\nRow0: (0,3)\n\nRow1: (0,3)\n\nRow2: (0,0)\n\nColumn2:\n\nRow0: (3,0)\n\nRow1: (0,0)\n\nRow2: (0,3)\n\nOutput is:\n\n[6,6,0]\n\n[6,0,0]\n\n[0,0,6]\n\nSo for output row0, column0: 6.\n\nHow is this derived from the three pairs in column0 of the input.\n\nLooking at column0 pairs: (4,4), (4,0), (0,0). Output row0 column0 is6.\n\nPerhaps if any of the pairs in the column meet a certain condition, then output 6. For example, if there's a pair (4,4) in the column, then output is 6 in that position for the first row. But how?\n\nAlternatively, the output for each row and column is 6 if the corresponding pair in the input row and column meets a condition, else 0.\n\nBut how to determine which row's pair affects which output.\n\nAlternatively, the output row corresponds to the input row, and each element in the output is determined by whether the pair in the input row's column has a certain relationship with the other rows' pairs in that column.\n\nThis seems too vague. Let's think of the output rows as combining information from all three input rows. For example, for output column0, the three input pairs are (4,4), (4,0), (0,0). Maybe sum each pair and take the total. For (4+4=8), (4+0=4), (0+0=0). Sum all:8+4+0=12. 12 divided by 2 is 6. So output for each row's column0 is 6 if their pair contributes to the total sum. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the output for each column is 6 if the sum of all elements in that column across all rows is a multiple of 6. For column0 in Example0: 4+4 +4+0 +0+0 = 8+4+0 =12. 12 is 6*2 \u2192 yes. So output column0 could have 6s. But output rows for column0 are [6,6,0]. So this doesn't directly translate.\n\nAnother Idea: Each output element is 6 if the corresponding pair in the input has at least one 4 in the left position or at least one 3 in the right position across all rows.\n\nFor example, for column0 in Example0:\n\nRow0's pair is (4,4), so left is4 \u2192 output row0 column0 is6.\n\nRow1's pair is (4,0), left is4 \u2192 output row1 column0 is6.\n\nRow2's pair is (0,0), no4 or3 \u2192 output 0.\n\nThis fits Example0's first column.\n\nFor column1 in Example0:\n\nRow0's pair (0,3) \u2192 right is3 \u2192 output row0 column1 is6.\n\nRow1's pair (0,3) \u2192 right is3 \u2192 output row1 column1 is6.\n\nRow2's pair (0,0) \u2192 no \u2192 output0.\n\nBut the output for column1 is [6,0,0]. Wait, this doesn't match.\n\nHmm. So this theory doesn't hold.\n\nAlternatively, the output for each row and column is 6 if the pair in that row and column meets a certain condition, else 0. But what condition?\n\nLet's look back at Example0's output:\n\nRow0's output: [6,6,0]. So for each pair in row0's columns:\n\nColumn0:6 \u2192 pair (4,4).\n\nColumn1:6 \u2192 pair (0,3).\n\nColumn2:0 \u2192 pair (3,0).\n\nWhat's common between the first two pairs and not the third?\n\nIn the first two pairs, either the first element is4 or the second is3. So (4,4) has first element4. (0,3) has second element3. (3,0) has neither.\n\nSo the rule could be: for a pair (a,b), output 6 if a=4 OR b=3.\n\nYes! Let's check this.\n\nExample0 row0:\n\n(4,4): a=4 \u21926.\n\n(0,3): b=3 \u21926.\n\n(3,0): neither \u21920. Correct.\n\nExample0 row1:\n\nInput pairs: (4,0), (0,3), (0,0).\n\nRow1's output: [6,0,0].\n\nSo:\n\n(4,0) \u2192a=4 \u21926.\n\n(0,3) \u2192b=3 \u21926. But output is0. Contradiction.\n\nHmm, so this doesn't hold. But wait, why is the output 0 here?\n\nLooking at Example0 row1's input pairs:\n\n(4,0): a=4 \u21926. Output is6.\n\n(0,3): b=3 \u21926. Output is0.\n\n(0,0): neither \u21920. Output is0.\n\nSo why the second pair in row1 gives 0?\n\nThis contradicts the rule. So maybe there's more to the rule.\n\nAh, perhaps the rule is: a pair (a,b) in row i and column j outputs 6 if a=4 and the corresponding pair in the previous row (i-1) has a=4. Or some dependency between rows.\n\nBut this seems too complex.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the condition is a=4 OR (b=3 and the pair is in an even column). But that's arbitrary.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the condition is a=4 OR b=3, but only if the sum of the entire row's pairs meets a certain condition. For example, if the sum of the row's pairs is even.\n\nExample0 row0 sum: (4+4) + (0+3) + (3+0) =8+3+3=14. Even? 14 is even \u2192 apply the condition. So 6,6,0.\n\nExample0 row1 sum: (4+0)+(0+3)+(0+0)=4+3+0=7. Odd \u2192 maybe don't apply the condition. So the pairs (4,0) would be 6 only if a=4. But the second pair (0,3) would not qualify. So row1's output would be [6,0,0]. Which matches.\n\nBut how does the sum of the row affect the condition?\n\nThis is getting too convoluted. Let's try to see if there's another pattern.\n\nLooking at Example3's input and output:\n\nExample3's input row0: [4,4,0,3,0,0]. Pairs: (4,4), (0,3), (0,0). Output: [6,6,0].\n\nAccording to the a=4 OR b=3 rule:\n\n(4,4) \u21926.\n\n(0,3) \u21926.\n\n(0,0) \u21920. Correct.\n\nExample3's row1 input: [0,0,0,0,0,3]. Pairs: (0,0), (0,0), (0,3). Output: [0,0,6]. \n\nSo:\n\n(0,0) \u21920.\n\n(0,0) \u21920.\n\n(0,3) \u2192b=3 \u21926. Correct.\n\nExample3's row2 input: [4,0,0,0,0,0]. Pairs: (4,0), (0,0), (0,0). Output: [6,0,0].\n\nSo:\n\n(4,0) \u2192a=4 \u21926.\n\nOthers \u21920. Correct.\n\nSo this fits the rule a=4 OR b=3.\n\nNow, let's check Example0's row1 again. Why does (0,3) become 0? According to the rule, it should be6. \n\nExample0's row1 input: [4,0,0,3,0,0]. Pairs: (4,0), (0,3), (0,0). \n\nAccording to the rule, first pair a=4 \u21926. Second pair b=3 \u21926. But output is [6,0,0].\n\nThis contradicts. Unless there's a vertical condition. For example, a pair (a,b) in row i and column j outputs 6 only if a=4 OR (b=3 and there's a 4 in the same column in any row above).\n\nIn Example0's column1:\n\nRow0's pair: (0,3) \u2192b=3. But there's no 4 in any row above (row0 is the first row). So output row0 column1 is6.\n\nRow1's pair (0,3): checks if there's a 4 in column1 above. Row0's column1 is (0,3) which doesn't have a4. So this pair's b=3 doesn't count. So output is0.\n\nThis could explain the discrepancy.\n\nBut this adds a vertical dependency, making the pattern more complex. How would we verify this?\n\nLet's look at Example1's input row1:\n\nExample1's input row1: [4,0,0,3,0,0]. Pairs: (4,0), (0,3), (0,0). Output row1 is [6,0,0].\n\nAccording to the vertical rule: for pair (0,3) in row1, column1. Check if any row above (row0) in column1 has a4. Row0's column1 pair is (4,3). So a=4 exists. So row1's (0,3) pair would have b=3 and a4 above, so output6. But actual output is0. So this theory is invalid.\n\nThis is getting too complicated. Let's try to find another pattern.\n\nLooking at the numbers 4 and 3, perhaps they are being treated as letters. 4 is 'D' and 3 is 'C'. So maybe the pairs form letters, and the output is based on that. For example, 'DC' could be converted to something. But this seems far-fetched.\n\nAlternatively, the numbers 4 and 3 add up to 7, which is the number of letters in \"six\". Not helpful.\n\nAnother Idea: Perhaps each 4 is converted to 3 and each 3 to 4, then summed. So (4,4) becomes (3,3) sum 6. (0,3) becomes (0,4) sum4. (4,3) becomes (3,4) sum7 \u21927. But how does this lead to 6s and 0s.\n\nAlternatively, the sum is capped at 6, so any sum >=6 becomes 6. For example:\n\n(4,4) \u21928 \u21926.\n\n(0,3) \u21923 \u21920.\n\nBut in Example0's output, (0,3) is6. So no.\n\nAnother Idea: Each pair is replaced by the number of 4s and 3s in the pair multiplied by 3. For example:\n\n(4,4): 2 *3=6.\n\n(0,3): 1 *3=3 \u21920.\n\nBut output is6. So no.\n\nAlternatively, if the pair contains both 4 and 3, then 6. If both are 4 or both are3, then6. Else 0.\n\nSo:\n\n(4,4) \u2192 same \u21926.\n\n(4,3) \u2192 both \u21926.\n\n(3,3) \u2192 same \u21926.\n\n(0,3) \u2192 only 3 \u21920.\n\n(3,0) \u2192 only3 \u21920.\n\nBut in Example0's first row, pair (0,3) becomes6. So this doesn't fit.\n\nThis is really challenging. Let's try to look for any other patterns.\n\nLooking at Example0's output:\n\nThe output rows are:\n\n[6,6,0]\n\n[6,0,0]\n\n[0,0,6]\n\nNoticing that in each output row, the 6s are in positions where the corresponding pairs in the input have certain properties. For example:\n\nRow0's first pair (4,4) \u21926.\n\nSecond pair (0,3) \u21926.\n\nThird pair (3,0) \u21920.\n\nRow1's first pair (4,0) \u21926.\n\nSecond pair (0,3) \u21920.\n\nThird pair (0,0) \u21920.\n\nRow2's first pair (0,0) \u21920.\n\nSecond pair (0,0) \u21920.\n\nThird pair (0,3) \u21926.\n\nSo, perhaps the output is 6 in a position if the pair in that row and column has either:\n\n- Both elements are the same and non-zero (4 or3).\n\n- One element is4 and the other is3.\n\nBut wait, let's check:\n\nExample0's row0, pair (4,4) \u2192 same \u21926.\n\nPair (0,3) \u21924 and3? No, 0 and3. So this doesn't fit. So output would be0, but it's6. So no.\n\nAlternatively, if the pair contains exactly one4 and one3. But (0,3) has none. So that's not.\n\nAnother Idea: Maybe each 4 and 3 in the input is being counted, and for each pair, if there's at least one 4 or 3, then it's 6. But then (0,3) would be6, (3,0) would be6. But in Example0's third pair (3,0), output is0.\n\nThis is confusing. Maybe the key is to look at the entire set of examples and see if there's a common thread.\n\nLooking at all examples, the output is always a combination of 6s and 0s, with each element derived from a pair in the input. The pattern seems to be that a pair is transformed into 6 if it meets certain conditions, but the condition varies depending on something.\n\nAnother observation: in Example0's input row0, the pairs (4,4), (0,3), (3,0) \u2192 output 6,6,0. In Example0's input row2, the pair (0,3) \u2192 output6. So the same pair can lead to different outputs depending on their position.\n\nThis suggests that the transformation rule is not based solely on the pair's elements, but also on their position in the grid.\n\nAlternatively, the output is a mirror or some other transformation of the input. For example, each row is reversed and certain elements are replaced. But this doesn't directly explain the 6s.\n\nAnother Idea: Each pair is converted to 6 if the first element is 4 or the second element is3, but only if the other element is not zero.\n\nSo:\n\n(4,4) \u21924 and non-zero \u21926.\n\n(0,3) \u21923 and other is0 \u2192 no. So output 0. But Example0's output for this pair is6. So no.\n\nThis is not working.\n\nAt this point, I'm stuck. Maybe I should try to find a pattern by looking for the numbers 4 and 3 in the input and how they relate to the output's 6s.\n\nNotice that 4 + 3 = 7, which is one more than 6. Maybe this is a clue. Or perhaps 4 and 3 are the numbers of letters in certain words.\n\nAlternatively, each 4 and 3 is treated as a step towards 6. For example, 4 + 3 =7, which is converted to 6 by subtracting 1. But why?\n\nAlternatively, each 4 is replaced with 3 and each 3 with 4, then summed. So 4+4 becomes 3+3=6. 4+3 becomes3+4=7 \u21927-1=6. 0+3 becomes0+4=4 \u21924. But in Example0's (0,3) pair, this would give 4, but output is6. So no.\n\nHmm.\n\nWait, let's look at the output for the test input. The test input is:\n\n[0,4,4,3,0,0]\n\n[4,0,0,3,3,0]\n\n[0,4,0,3,0,0]\n\nIf the pattern is that each pair (a,b) is 6 if a=4 OR b=3, then:\n\nTest input row0 pairs:\n\n(0,4) \u2192 a=0, b=4 \u2192 no \u21920.\n\n(4,3) \u2192a=4 \u21926.\n\n(0,0) \u2192 no \u21920. So output row0 would be [0,6,0].\n\nRow1 pairs: (4,0) \u2192a=4 \u21926. (0,3) \u2192b=3 \u21926. (3,0) \u2192a=3 \u2192 no. So output row1: [6,6,0].\n\nRow2 pairs: (0,4) \u2192a=0 \u2192 no. (0,3) \u2192b=3 \u21926. (0,0) \u2192 no \u21920. Output row2: [0,6,0].\n\nBut the training examples don't follow this rule consistently. For example, Example0's row1 pair (0,3) should output6 but gives0. So this rule is invalid.\n\nAnother Idea: Maybe each pair is transformed into 6 if the sum of the pair is 7 or 8 (4+3=7,4+4=8,3+3=6). But then:\n\nTest input row0's pairs:\n\n(0,4) sum4 \u21920.\n\n(4,3) sum7 \u21926.\n\n(0,0) sum0 \u21920. So output row0: [0,6,0].\n\nRow1 pairs: (4,0) sum4 \u21920. (0,3) sum3 \u21920. (3,0) sum3 \u21920. Output row1: [0,0,0]. But according to Example1's output, this isn't the case.\n\nAlternatively, if the sum is >=6, then output6. So:\n\n(0,4) sum4 \u21920.\n\n(4,3) sum7 \u21926.\n\n(0,0) sum0 \u21920. So row0: [0,6,0].\n\nRow1 pairs: (4,0) sum4 \u21920. (0,3) sum3 \u21920. (3,0) sum3 \u21920. So row1: [0,0,0].\n\nRow2 pairs: (0,4) sum4 \u21920. (0,3) sum3 \u21920. (0,0) sum0 \u21920. Row2: [0,0,0].\n\nBut this doesn't match any of the training examples' outputs, like Example1's output which has three 6s.\n\nThis isn't working. Maybe the correct approach is to consider that each pair is replaced by 6 if it contains a 4 in the first position or a 3 in the second, but only if there's a corresponding pair in another row.\n\nFor example, if in the same column, any row has a pair with a4 or3 in certain positions. But this is too vague.\n\nAt this point, after trying numerous possibilities and not finding a consistent rule, I think the correct approach is to look for the following pattern:\n\nEach pair (a, b) in the input is transformed into 6 if a is 4 or b is 3. This explains most of the training examples except for a few discrepancies, but perhaps those discrepancies are due to a vertical dependency or another layer of the pattern.\n\nGiven the test input:\n\nTest input rows:\n\nRow0: [0,4,4,3,0,0] \u2192 pairs (0,4), (4,3), (0,0).\n\nApplying the rule a=4 or b=3:\n\n(0,4) \u2192 a=0, b=4 \u2192 no. So 0.\n\n(4,3) \u2192a=4 \u21926.\n\n(0,0) \u21920. So output row0: [0,6,0].\n\nRow1: [4,0,0,3,3,0] \u2192 pairs (4,0), (0,3), (3,0).\n\n(4,0) \u2192a=4 \u21926.\n\n(0,3) \u2192b=3 \u21926.\n\n(3,0) \u2192a=3 \u2192 no. So 0. Output row1: [6,6,0].\n\nRow2: [0,4,0,3,0,0] \u2192 pairs (0,4), (0,3), (0,0).\n\n(0,4) \u21920.\n\n(0,3) \u2192b=3 \u21926.\n\n(0,0) \u21920. Output row2: [0,6,0].\n\nBut according to this, the output would be:\n\n[0,6,0]\n\n[6,6,0]\n\n[0,6,0]\n\nBut looking at the training examples, this doesn't match the structure. For instance, Example0's row1 has a pair (0,3) which would be6 but output is0.\n\nHowever, perhaps there's a vertical component where the column must have a 4 in any row's a position or a3 in any row's b position. For example, for a column j, if any pair in that column has a=4 or b=3, then all pairs in that column for each row become6. But this seems to fit some examples.\n\nFor instance, Example0's column0:\n\nPairs (4,4), (4,0), (0,0). Any a=4 in column0? Yes, in row0 and row1. So output for column0 in all rows is6. But Example0's output for column0 is [6,6,0]. So no.\n\nThis is getting too time-consuming. Given the time I've spent and the patterns I've tried, the most plausible explanation despite the contradictions is the a=4 or b=3 rule. Perhaps the contradictions are due to my misunderstanding, and the correct answer follows this rule.\n\nGiven that, the test input's output would be:\n\nRow0: [0,6,0]\n\nRow1: [6,6,0]\n\nRow2: [0,6,0]\n\nBut looking at the training examples, for example, Example1's input row0 pairs (4,0), (4,3), (3,0) \u2192 output [6,6,6]. According to the rule, (4,0) \u21926, (4,3) \u21926, (3,0) \u21920. But output is6 for all. So this rule is invalid.\n\nTherefore, I must have missed something. The correct pattern must involve vertical processing. For example, each output element is 6 if the corresponding pair in the input and the pairs in the same column in other rows meet a condition.\n\nFor instance, for each column, if any of the pairs in that column across the three rows has a 4 in the first element or a3 in the second, then all elements in that column of the output are6. Otherwise 0. But this doesn't fit the training examples.\n\nAlternatively, for each column, count the number of 4s in the first elements and 3s in the second elements. If the count is at least one, then the corresponding output elements for that column are6. But again, not matching.\n\nAnother Idea: The output is the sum of 3 for each 4 and 3 in the pair. For example, each 4 and 3 contributes 3, so a pair with two 4s would be 3+3=6. A pair with one3 would be3. But output requires 6. So perhaps each 4 or3 in the pair counts as 3, and if the sum is 6, output6. Otherwise, output0.\n\nFor Example0's first pair (4,4) \u21923+3=6 \u21926.\n\nSecond pair (0,3) \u21923 \u21920.\n\nBut output is6. So no.\n\nAlternatively, each 4 and3 in the pair counts as 3, sum and if >=3, output6. So (0,3) \u21923 \u21926. (4,4) \u21926 \u21926. (3,0) \u21923 \u21926. But in Example0's third pair, output is0. So no.\n\nI'm at a loss. Given time constraints, perhaps I should proceed with the initial hypothesis, even if there are contradictions, and see if the test input follows it."

        "cot_1": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. So, looking at the training examples, each input is a list of lists (three rows each with six numbers), and the output is another list of lists (three rows each with three numbers). The numbers in the output are either 0 or 6. Hmm.\n\nLet's look at Example 0. The input has three rows of six numbers each. The output is three rows of three numbers. For the first input row [4,4,0,3,3,0], the output is [6,6,0]. Wait, maybe the input is split into pairs? Because 4 and 4, then 0 and 3, then 3 and 0. Then adding them? But 4+4=8, which isn't 6. Or maybe combining them in some way. Wait, but in the output, each element is 6 or 0. So maybe if both elements in a pair are non-zero, they become 6, otherwise 0? Let's check.\n\nIn Example 0's first input row: [4,4,0,3,3,0]. If we group them into three pairs: (4,4), (0,3), (3,0). For the first pair, both non-zero \u2192 6. The second pair: 0 and 3 \u2192 one zero \u2192 0. Third pair: 3 and 0 \u2192 0. So the output is [6,0,0]. Wait, but the actual output is [6,6,0]. Oh, maybe that's not the case. Wait, maybe it's something else.\n\nWait, maybe each pair is summed, and if the sum is a multiple of 7? But 4+4=8, 0+3=3, 3+0=3. Not sure. Alternatively, maybe the sum of the pair is 7, then converted to 6? Because 4+3=7. Oh, right! Because 4 and 3 add up to 7. Let's see:\n\nIn Example 0's first input row: [4,4,0,3,3,0]. Grouped into pairs (4,4), (0,3), (3,0). The sum of each pair:\n\n4+4=8 \u2192 maybe not. 0+3=3, 3+0=3. Hmm, that doesn't add up to 7. But the output here is [6,6,0]. Wait, maybe each pair's sum is replaced by 6 if the sum is 7, else 0. But 4+3=7, which would be 6. Wait, maybe each pair is (a, b) where a and b are non-zero, and their sum is 7. Let's check.\n\nWait in Example 0's input, first row: the pairs are (4,4), sum 8. Second pair (0,3): sum 3. Third (3,0): sum 3. But output is [6,6,0]. So that doesn't fit. So perhaps that's not the pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each pair is (a, b), and if either a or b is non-zero, but not both? But then again, the outputs are 6s. Let's think differently.\n\nLooking at the output structure: each output row has three elements. Since the input row has six elements, maybe each pair of elements in the input is transformed into one element in the output. So three pairs per row \u2192 three elements in output.\n\nBut how? Let's look for a rule. Let's take Example 0's input:\n\nInput row 0: [4,4,0,3,3,0] \u2192 output [6,6,0].\n\nIf we split into three pairs: (4,4), (0,3), (3,0). The output elements are 6,6,0. So maybe for each pair, if both are non-zero and sum to 7, then 6, else 0. Wait, 4+4=8. 0+3=3. 3+0=3. But 4 and 3 in different positions sum to 7. Wait maybe each pair is (left, right) elements from two different positions?\n\nWait, maybe the input is being split into columns instead of pairs. Wait, maybe each output element is derived from two columns of the input. Let's see: the input has 6 elements per row. The output has 3. So perhaps each two columns in the input are combined into one column in the output. So for example, columns 0 and 1 become output column 0, columns 2 and 3 become output column 1, columns 4 and 5 become output column 2.\n\nLooking at Example 0's first input row: columns 0-1: 4,4 \u2192 output 6. Columns 2-3: 0,3 \u2192 output 6. Columns 4-5:3,0 \u2192 output 0. Hmm. So how does 4 and 4 become 6? 0 and 3 become 6. Hmm. Let's check other examples.\n\nTake Example 1's input:\n\nFirst input row: [4,0,4,3,3,0]. Split into columns 0-1:4,0; 2-3:4,3; 4-5:3,0. Output row is [6,6,6]. So for 4 and 0 \u2192 6. 4 and 3 \u2192 6. 3 and 0 \u21926. So maybe any pair that contains a 4 or a 3 (but not both?) but that's not clear. Alternatively, if either element in the pair is non-zero, then 6. But wait, in Example 0's third input row: [0,0,0,0,0,3]. Split into pairs (0,0), (0,0), (0,3). The output is [0,0,6]. So here, only the third pair has a non-zero element (3), hence 6. So perhaps the rule is: for each pair of columns, if at least one element is non-zero, then sum 4 and 3 (if present) and turn into 6. Wait, maybe it's that each pair contributes 6 if the pair contains a 4 and a 3 in any order. Let's test that.\n\nIn Example 0's first input row, pairs:\n\n4 and4 \u2192 no 3, so output 6? But that's two 4s. Hmm, but output is 6 here. Wait maybe the sum of the pair is 7. Because 4+3=7. Let's check:\n\nIn Example 0's first row pairs:\n\n4+4=8 \u2192 not 7.\n\n0+3=3 \u2192 no.\n\n3+0=3 \u2192 no. But output here is [6,6,0]. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, if the pair has a 4 and a 3. For example, 4 and3 in any order would sum to 7. So if the pair is (4,3), sum is 7, so 6. But in the first example's first pair, it's (4,4). Sum is 8. But the output is 6. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each pair is converted to 6 if there's at least one 4 and one 3 in the pair. Wait, but (4,4) has two 4s, so no 3. But output is 6. So that's not it.\n\nHmm. Let's look at another example. Take Example 2's input:\n\nInput row 0: [0,0,4,0,3,0]. Split into pairs (0,0), (4,0), (3,0). Output is [0,6,6]. Wait, how?\n\nSo (0,0) becomes 0. (4,0) becomes 6. (3,0) becomes 6. So maybe if a pair has a 4 or a 3, then 6. But in that case, any pair with a 4 or 3 would be 6. So for (4,0) \u21926. (3,0)\u21926. (0,4) \u21926. (0,3)\u21926. Let's test this.\n\nIn Example 0's first row, pairs (4,4) \u2192 both 4 \u2192 6. (0,3) \u2192 has a 3 \u21926. (3,0) \u21923 \u21926. But the output is [6,6,0]. Wait, but the third pair (3,0) is being considered as 0. Wait that's conflicting. Wait in Example 0's output, the third element is 0, but the third pair is (3,0), which has a 3. So this idea is incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pairs are summed, and if the sum is 7, it's 6, else 0. So 4+3=7 \u21926. 3+4=7\u21926. 4+4=8\u21920. 0+3=3\u21920, etc. Let's test this.\n\nExample 0's first input row pairs:\n\n(4,4) sum 8 \u21920. (0,3) sum 3\u21920. (3,0) sum3\u21920. But output is [6,6,0]. That doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. Maybe there's another approach. Let's look at the outputs. All outputs are 6s and 0s. 6 could represent that a condition is met. Let's see if in the input rows, for each output element, there's a 4 and a 3 in the corresponding two input positions. For example, in Example 0's first input row:\n\nInput row: [4,4,0,3,3,0]. The output is [6,6,0]. Let's split the input into three pairs of two elements each:\n\nPair 1: 4,4 \u2192 are there any 3s here? No. But output is 6. Pair 2: 0,3 \u2192 has a 3. Output is 6. Pair3:3,0 \u2192 has a 3. Output is 0. Hmm, that's confusing.\n\nWait maybe each pair contributes to the output if it's a 4 followed by a 3, or a 3 followed by a 4. Like in pair, if there's a 4 and 3 adjacent. For example, if a pair is (4,3) or (3,4), then 6, else 0.\n\nBut in Example 0's first pair (4,4), output is 6. So that's not it.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each element in the output corresponds to two columns from the input, but vertically across all three rows. Wait, maybe the output is generated by looking at the columns across all three rows and summing or something. Let's think about that.\n\nFor example, in Example 0:\n\nInput is three rows, each with six elements. Let's arrange them as three rows, six columns:\n\nRow 0: [4,4,0,3,3,0]\n\nRow 1: [4,0,0,3,0,0]\n\nRow 2: [0,0,0,0,0,3]\n\nNow, the output is three rows, three elements each. Maybe each output element is derived from a 2x3 grid. Wait, perhaps the input is a 3x6 grid, and the output is a 3x3 grid, where each output cell is 6 if, in the corresponding 2x2 block of the input, there's at least one 4 and one 3. Hmm, but that might be complicated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each output row is derived from the corresponding input row by combining two adjacent elements. Let's look at Example 0's input and output again.\n\nInput row 0: [4,4,0,3,3,0] \u2192 Output row 0: [6,6,0]\n\nIf each output element is generated by combining two elements from the input row. So the first two elements (4,4) \u2192 6. The next two (0,3) \u21926. The next two (3,0) \u21920. Hmm, how?\n\nAnother approach: perhaps the output is the sum of 4s and 3s in each pair, but converted to 6 if there's at least one 4 and one 3. For example:\n\nIf a pair has both a 4 and a 3, sum is 7 \u2192 6. But in the first example, pair (4,4) \u2192 sum 8. But output is 6. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each pair is converted to 6 if the pair contains at least one 4 and one 3, regardless of order. So if the pair is (4,3) or (3,4), then 6. Otherwise, 0. Let's test this.\n\nIn Example 0's first row pairs:\n\n(4,4) \u2192 no 3 \u2192 0. (0,3) \u2192 no 4 \u2192 0. (3,0) \u2192 no 4 \u21920. But output is [6,6,0], so that's not matching.\n\nHmm. Let's take another example. Example 1's input row 0: [4,0,4,3,3,0]. Split into pairs (4,0), (4,3), (3,0). Output is [6,6,6]. According to the hypothesis above, (4,0) has a 4 but no 3 \u21920. But output is 6. So that's wrong.\n\nWait maybe it's that each pair's elements sum to a multiple of 7. For example, 4 +3=7. But (4,0) sums to 4. So that's not it. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each pair's elements are multiplied, and if the product is a multiple of 12 (since 4*3=12), then output 6. Let's see:\n\nFor Example 0's first pair (4,4): product 16. Not a multiple of 12. So output 0. But output is 6 here. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the presence of 4 or 3 in the pair. For example, each pair that has a 4 or a 3 contributes 6. But in Example 0's first pair (4,4) \u2192 yes, so 6. (0,3) \u2192 yes (3), so 6. (3,0) \u2192 yes (3), so 6. But output is [6,6,0]. Wait the third pair is (3,0), which has a 3, so output should be 6, but actual output is 0. So this doesn't fit.\n\nWait maybe it's the number of non-zero elements in the pair. If two non-zero elements, then 6. If one, then 0. Let's check.\n\nExample 0's first row:\n\n(4,4) \u2192 two non-zero \u21926. (0,3) \u2192 one \u21920. (3,0) \u2192 one \u21920. So output should be [6,0,0]. But actual output is [6,6,0]. So that's not matching.\n\nHmm. Let's think differently. Let's look at all the input and output pairs for each example and see if there's a vertical component.\n\nFor example, in Example 0's output:\n\nOutput rows are:\n\n[6,6,0]\n\n[6,0,0]\n\n[0,0,6]\n\nInput rows are:\n\n[4,4,0,3,3,0]\n\n[4,0,0,3,0,0]\n\n[0,0,0,0,0,3]\n\nLooking at output column 0 of the first row (6), input columns 0 and 1 (4,4). Maybe in the first output column, if there are 4s in the first two columns of the input rows, sum up. Wait, but how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe each output cell is determined by the three rows in the input. For example, for each output column (since input is 3x6, output is 3x3), perhaps each output column is a combination of two input columns across all three rows.\n\nWait, maybe each output column j is derived from input columns 2j and 2j+1 across all three rows. For example, output column 0 comes from input columns 0 and 1 in each row. Then for each output cell in row i, column j, look at input row i's columns 2j and 2j+1.\n\nBut how do those two input columns generate the output cell?\n\nLooking at Example 0:\n\nOutput row 0, column 0 is 6. Input row 0, columns 0 and 1: 4 and4. Output is 6.\n\nIn Example 1's first row, input columns 0 and1 are 4 and0 \u2192 output is6.\n\nSo what's common between these pairs that gives 6? 4 and4, 4 and0. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe for each pair of input columns (in each row), if there's a 4 present in either of the two columns, then output 6. But then, in Example0's first pair (4,4) \u21926. Second pair (0,3) \u2192 no 4, but output is 6. So that can't be.\n\nWait, in Example0's second pair (columns 2 and3) for row 0:0 and3. Output is6. So perhaps 3's presence leads to 6. But then, in the third pair (3 and0) \u21923 is present, but output is0. That's conflicting.\n\nAlternatively, maybe if a pair has both 4 and3 (in any order), output 6. Otherwise, output 0. Let's see:\n\nIn Example0's first pair (4,4) \u2192 no 3. Output is6. That doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. Let's try to think of another approach. The numbers in the input are 4,3,0. The output is 6 or 0. Maybe 4 and 3 are being added and multiplied. For example, 4+3=7 \u2192 but why 6? Or 4*3=12 \u2192 perhaps 6 is half of that? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 4 and3 represent positions or counts, and 6 is the sum of their counts. Wait, but how.\n\nAlternatively, considering that 4 +3 =7, and 6 is one less than 7. But not sure.\n\nLooking at Example0's output row 3: [0,0,6]. The input row has [0,0,0,0,0,3]. The last pair is (0,3), which would output 6. So maybe if any of the two elements in the pair is 3, then 6. But then in the first pair of Example0's input row 0 (4,4) \u2192 no 3. But output is6. So that's conflicting.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is 6 if either of the two elements is non-zero, regardless of which number. So if a pair has any non-zero numbers, output 6. But in Example0's first row, the third pair is (3,0) \u2192 non-zero \u2192 should output6, but output is0. So no.\n\nHmm. Let's look at Example3's input and output.\n\nExample3 input row0: [4,4,0,3,0,0] \u2192 output [6,6,0]. Pairs are (4,4), (0,3), (0,0). So first pair has two 4s \u21926. Second pair has 0 and3 \u21926. Third pair 0,0 \u21920. So why the second pair (0,3) gives 6. Maybe if either element is non-zero, output6. Then, in that case, (0,3) \u2192 yes. So output6. Third pair (0,0) \u21920. So that would make sense. But then in Example0's third pair (3,0) \u2192 non-zero \u21926, but output is0. So conflicting.\n\nSo this idea is invalid.\n\nAnother approach: let's see if the sum of all elements in the input rows affects the output. For example, in Example0's input:\n\nRow0 sum:4+4+0+3+3+0=14\n\nRow1:4+0+0+3+0+0=7\n\nRow2:0+0+0+0+0+3=3\n\nOutput rows sum to 6+6+0=12, 6+0+0=6, 0+0+6=6. Not obvious.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output counts the number of 4s and 3s in each pair. For example, each pair's 4s and 3s are summed, but converted to 6. Like, if a pair contains a 4 and a 3, sum is7, which becomes6. If two 4s, sum is8 \u21926. If two3s, sum is6. Wait, but how?\n\nWait, maybe the output is the sum of the pair modulo 6. For example, 4+4=8 mod6=2 \u2192 no. 0+3=3 mod6=3. But output is6. So no.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each 4 is treated as 3 and each3 as 4, then summed. But 4 becomes3, 3 becomes4. Then sum: 4+4 \u21923+3=6 \u21926. 0+3 \u21920+4=4. 3+0\u21924+0=4. So output would be [6,4,4], which doesn't match the example.\n\nHmm. This is getting tricky. Let's try to find a pattern across all examples.\n\nLooking at Example0's output:\n\nOutput row0: [6,6,0]\n\nInput row0: [4,4,0,3,3,0]\n\nSo pairs (4,4), (0,3), (3,0). Output 6,6,0.\n\nExample1 input row0: [4,0,4,3,3,0] \u2192 output [6,6,6]. Pairs (4,0), (4,3), (3,0). Output 6,6,6.\n\nExample2 input row0: [0,0,4,0,3,0] \u2192 output [0,6,6]. Pairs (0,0), (4,0), (3,0).\n\nExample3 input row0: [4,4,0,3,0,0] \u2192 output [6,6,0]. Pairs (4,4), (0,3), (0,0).\n\nExample4 input row0: [0,0,0,0,3,0] \u2192 output [0,6,0]. Pairs (0,0), (0,0), (3,0).\n\nSo looking for a pattern, perhaps each pair in the input contributes to the output as follows: if the pair contains a 4 in the first element and a 3 in the second, then 6. Or maybe if either the first or second element is non-zero, then 6. But in Example0's third pair (3,0) \u2192 output is0. So if the pair is (3,0), why is it 0?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pair is summed, and if the sum is even, then 6, else 0. But 4+4=8 (even) \u21926. 0+3=3 (odd) \u21920. 3+0=3 \u21920. Output [6,0,0], but actual output is [6,6,0]. Doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the sum of the pair is divided by 7 and multiplied by 6. For example, 4+3=7 \u21927/7*6=6. 4+4=8 \u21928/7~1.14 \u21926. But that's not integer. So not sure.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps the output is 6 for each pair where both elements are non-zero. So for Example0's first pair (4,4) \u2192 both non-zero \u21926. Second pair (0,3) \u2192 one non-zero \u21920. But the output is 6, which contradicts this. So that's not it.\n\nWait, looking back at Example0's output, the first two elements are 6,6. The pairs are (4,4) and (0,3). So why are they both 6? Maybe there's a vertical component. Like for each output column, check all three rows' pairs.\n\nFor example, output column 0 in Example0 is 6 for all three rows. Let's see the input pairs for column 0 across all three rows:\n\nRow0's pair for column0:4,4.\n\nRow1:4,0.\n\nRow2:0,0.\n\nBut output for column0 is [6,6,0]. Hmm. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, for each output cell (i,j), look at input cell (i, 2j) and (i, 2j+1). If either of them is a 4 or a 3, then 6. Otherwise, 0. So for Example0's first row, first pair (4,4) \u2192 both are 4 \u21926. Second pair (0,3) \u21923 is present \u21926. Third pair (3,0) \u21923 is present \u21926. But output is [6,6,0]. So third pair's output is 0, but according to this rule it should be 6. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe if the pair contains a 4 in the first element or a 3 in the second element. For Example0's first pair (4,4): first element is4 \u21926. Second pair (0,3): second element is3 \u21926. Third pair (3,0): first element is3 \u2192 maybe not 4. So output would be 0. So [6,6,0]. Which matches Example0's output. Let's test this hypothesis.\n\nRule for output element: For each pair (a,b) in the input, output 6 if a is 4 or b is3. Otherwise, 0.\n\nLet's check Example0's first row:\n\nPair1:4,4 \u2192 a=4 \u21926. Correct.\n\nPair2:0,3 \u2192 b=3 \u21926. Correct.\n\nPair3:3,0 \u2192 a=3 (not4) and b=0 \u21920. Correct.\n\nExample0's output is [6,6,0]. Fits.\n\nExample1's first row input: [4,0,4,3,3,0]. Pairs:\n\nPair1:4,0 \u2192a=4 \u21926.\n\nPair2:4,3 \u2192a=4 \u21926. Also b=3 \u21926.\n\nPair3:3,0 \u2192a=3 (not4), b=0 \u21920. But output is6. Hmm, this is a problem.\n\nWait output for Example1's first row is [6,6,6]. So third pair must have output6. According to the rule, pair3 is (3,0): a is3 (not4) and b is0 (not3). So output should be0. But actual output is6. So this rule is invalid.\n\nHmm. So maybe the rule needs to be adjusted. What if the pair has either a=4 or b=3, or both?\n\nIn Example1's pair3:3,0. a=3 (not4), b=0 (not3). So output would be0, but actual output is6. So that's not working.\n\nAlternative rule: output 6 if either a is3 or b is4. Let's see.\n\nExample0's first pair: a=4, b=4. 4 is not3, 4 is4 \u2192 so 6? Not sure. Let's see.\n\nBut this is getting too arbitrary. Maybe there's a different pattern.\n\nLet's consider the possibility that each 4 and 3 in the input are converted to 6 in the output, but merged with their adjacent elements. For example, each 4 and 3 in the input is replaced by 6 in the output, but summed in some way.\n\nLooking at Example0's input:\n\nRow0: [4,4,0,3,3,0]\n\nOutput row0: [6,6,0]\n\nSo the first two 4s become 6 and6? Wait, no. Output is three elements. Perhaps each pair of elements in the input is summed, and then 6 is placed if the sum is 4+3=7. But that's not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each occurrence of 4 and 3 in the input is counted, and the output is the count multiplied by 6 divided by something. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, considering that the output has three elements per row, each derived from two input elements, and if both are non-zero, then 6. Otherwise, 0. Wait:\n\nExample0's first pair (4,4): non-zero \u21926. Second pair (0,3): only one non-zero \u21920. Third pair (3,0): one non-zero \u21920. But output is [6,6,0]. So this doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. Let's try another approach. Let's look at all the training examples and see if there's a common pattern in how the input is transformed to output.\n\nExample0:\n\nInput rows:\n\n[4,4,0,3,3,0]\n\n[4,0,0,3,0,0]\n\n[0,0,0,0,0,3]\n\nOutput rows:\n\n[6,6,0]\n\n[6,0,0]\n\n[0,0,6]\n\nExample1:\n\nInput rows:\n\n[4,0,4,3,3,0]\n\n[4,0,0,3,0,0]\n\n[0,0,4,3,0,0]\n\nOutput:\n\n[6,6,6]\n\n[6,0,0]\n\n[6,0,6]\n\nExample2:\n\nInput:\n\n[0,0,4,0,3,0]\n\n[0,4,4,3,0,3]\n\n[4,4,0,0,0,3]\n\nOutput:\n\n[0,6,6]\n\n[6,6,6]\n\n[6,6,6]\n\nExample3:\n\nInput:\n\n[4,4,0,3,0,0]\n\n[0,0,0,0,0,3]\n\n[4,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nOutput:\n\n[6,6,0]\n\n[0,0,6]\n\n[6,0,0]\n\nExample4:\n\nInput:\n\n[0,0,0,0,3,0]\n\n[4,0,0,0,0,0]\n\n[0,0,4,3,3,0]\n\nOutput:\n\n[0,6,0]\n\n[6,0,0]\n\n[6,6,6]\n\nLooking at these, perhaps the rule is that for each pair of consecutive elements in the input row, if the pair contains at least one 4 and at least one 3 (in any order), then output 6. Otherwise, output 0.\n\nLet's test this.\n\nExample0's first row pairs:\n\nPair1: (4,4) \u2192 two 4s \u2192 no 3 \u2192 output0. But output is6. So no.\n\nExample1's first row pairs:\n\nPair1:4 and0 \u2192 no3 \u2192 output0. But output is6. So no.\n\nAlternative idea: Maybe each pair is converted to 6 if there is a 4 in the first element and a 3 in the second element. So for a pair (a, b), if a=4 and b=3, output6. Otherwise, 0.\n\nBut in Example0's first pair (4,4) \u2192 no. Second pair (0,3) \u2192 a=0, no. Third pair (3,0) \u2192 no. So output would be all 0s. But Example0's output is [6,6,0]. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAnother possibility: each 4 in the input is replaced with 6, and each 3 is replaced with 6, and 0 remains 0. But merged with adjacent elements. For example, in Example0's input row0: [4,4,0,3,3,0]. Replacing 4 and3 with 6: [6,6,0,6,6,0]. Then, grouping into three pairs and summing or something. But how to get from that to [6,6,0]. If we take the first two 6s \u21926. Next two 0,6 \u21926. Last two 6,0 \u21926. But the output is [6,6,0]. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe after replacing 4 and3 with6, each pair is summed, but if the sum is 12, then 6. But 6+6=12 \u21926. 6+0=6 \u21926. 0+6=6 \u21926. But this would lead to [6,6,6], which doesn't match Example0's output.\n\nHmm. I'm stuck. Let's think of another angle. Maybe the output is a combination of the 4s and 3s in the input. Each 4 and 3 in the input contributes to a 6 in the output, but only if they are in specific positions. For example, columns 0 and1 in the input are merged into column0 of the output, and similarly for others. But how?\n\nLooking at Example0's output:\n\nRow0: [6,6,0]\n\nLooking at input row0's columns0-1:4,4. Columns2-3:0,3. Columns4-5:3,0. \n\nIf each output column is the sum of 4s and3s in the input columns, but divided by something. For example, in columns0-1:4+4=8 \u21928/(4/6) \u219212. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, count the number of 4s and3s in each pair and multiply by 6 divided by their sum. Not making sense.\n\nWait, the numbers 4 and3. Their sum is7, but the output is6. Maybe 4 and3 are converted to 6 in the output, but when they are adjacent. Like, if a 4 and3 are in the same pair, they form a 6. Otherwise, 0.\n\nBut in Example0's first row, pair (0,3) \u2192 no4. So output would be0. But output is6. So that's not it.\n\nAlternatively, if a pair contains any 4 or3, output6. So any non-zero in the pair. But as earlier examples show this isn't the case.\n\nAlternatively, the output is 6 for each pair where there is at least one 4. Let's check.\n\nExample0's first pair (4,4) \u2192 yes \u21926. Second pair (0,3) \u2192 no4 \u21920. Third pair (3,0) \u2192 no \u21920. So output would be [6,0,0], but actual output is [6,6,0]. So no.\n\nSimilarly, maybe 6 if there is at least one3. Example0's first pair (4,4) \u2192 no3 \u21920. But output is6. So no.\n\nHmm. Let's consider the possibility that the output is generated by looking at the entire three-row input for each output column. For example, output column j is determined by the three pairs in column j of each input row.\n\nFor example, in Example0's output column0:\n\nOutputs are 6,6,0.\n\nThe three pairs for column0 in the input are:\n\nRow0:4,4\n\nRow1:4,0\n\nRow2:0,0.\n\nIf any of these pairs in any row contains a 4 and a3, then output6 in that row's column. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, for each output column j, each row's output is 6 if the corresponding pair in that row's input has a 4 and a3, otherwise 0. But Example0's first pair (4,4) \u2192 no3, so output0. But output is6. So no.\n\nThis is really challenging. Let's try to look for a pattern in the Test Input and see if we can apply possible rules.\n\nTest Input:\n\n[0,0,4,0,3,0]\n\n[0,4,0,3,3,3]\n\n[4,0,0,3,0,0]\n\nWe need to split each row into pairs:\n\nRow0: (0,0), (4,0), (3,0)\n\nRow1: (0,4), (0,3), (3,3)\n\nRow2: (4,0), (0,3), (0,0)\n\nNow, applying a hypothetical rule.\n\nLooking at the training examples, let's try to find a rule that fits all examples.\n\nLooking at Example2's output. Input row0 is [0,0,4,0,3,0]. Output is [0,6,6].\n\nPairs are (0,0) \u21920, (4,0) \u21926, (3,0) \u21926. So why?\n\nIf the rule is: for a pair (a,b), output 6 if a is 4 or b is 3. \n\nExample2's row0:\n\nPair1:0,0 \u2192 no \u21920.\n\nPair2:4,0 \u2192a=4 \u21926.\n\nPair3:3,0 \u2192a=3 \u2192 no. But output is6. So this rule doesn't work.\n\nAlternative rule: output 6 if either a or b is 4 or 3.\n\nSo for any pair that contains a 4 or 3, output6. Else 0.\n\nExample0's first pair (4,4) \u2192 yes \u21926.\n\nSecond pair (0,3) \u2192 yes (3) \u21926.\n\nThird pair (3,0) \u2192 yes \u21926. But output is0. So conflicting.\n\nBut in Example0's output, the third element is0 despite having a3.\n\nHmm. Maybe it's the sum of the pair. If sum is 4+3=7 \u21926. Otherwise, 0.\n\nBut for (4,4) sum 8 \u21920. But output is6.\n\nAlternatively, if the pair contains exactly one 4 and one3 \u2192 sum7 \u21926. Otherwise,0.\n\nBut in Example0's first pair, two4s \u21920. But output is6. So no.\n\nAlternatively, if the pair contains at least one4 and at least one3 \u21926. But in Example0's first pair, two4s \u2192 no3 \u21920. But output is6. So no.\n\nThis is really confusing. Let's try to find a pattern where the output is 6 for each pair where the elements are non-zero. For Example0's first pair (4,4) \u21926. Second pair (0,3) \u21923 is non-zero \u21926. Third pair (3,0) \u21923 \u21926. But output is [6,6,0]. So that doesn't fit.\n\nWait, maybe the output is 6 if the sum of the pair is greater than or equal to 7. For example, 4+3=7 \u21926. 4+4=8\u21926. 0+3=3\u21920. 3+0=3\u21920. So for Example0's first pair sum8 \u21926. Second pair sum3 \u21920. Third pair sum3\u21920. Output would be [6,0,0], but actual output is [6,6,0]. Doesn't fit.\n\nAnother approach: Maybe each 4 is replaced with 3 and each3 is replaced with4, and then each pair's sum is taken. For example, in Example0's first pair (4,4) \u21923+3=6 \u21926. Second pair (0,3) \u21920+4=4\u21920. Third pair (3,0) \u21924+0=4\u21920. Output [6,0,0]. Doesn't fit actual output [6,6,0].\n\nAlternatively, each 4 and3 is replaced with 3 and4 respectively, and then summed. 4 becomes3, 3 becomes4. So pair (4,4) becomes3+3=6\u21926. Pair (0,3) \u21920+4=4\u21920. Sum is4\u21920. Output [6,0,0]. Still not matching.\n\nHmm. Let's look for another pattern. Maybe the output is 6 if the pair contains a 4 in the first position or a3 in the second position.\n\nExample0's first pair:4 in first \u21926. Second pair:3 in second \u21926. Third pair:3 in first \u2192 no. Output [6,6,0]. Which matches.\n\nExample1's first row pairs:\n\nPair1:4 in first \u21926.\n\nPair2:4 in first \u21926.\n\nPair3:3 in first \u2192 no. Output third element is6. So this doesn't fit.\n\nExample1's output row0 is [6,6,6]. So third pair must meet the condition. But according to this rule, it doesn't. So the hypothesis is invalid.\n\nAnother possible rule: if the pair has a 4 in the first position or a3 in the first position. But Example0's third pair has3 in first \u2192 output0. So no.\n\nAlternatively, if the pair contains a4 in either position or a3 in either position, output6. So any pair with 4 or3. Let's test:\n\nExample0's first pair (4,4) \u2192 yes \u21926.\n\nSecond pair (0,3) \u2192 yes \u21926.\n\nThird pair (3,0) \u2192 yes \u21926. But output is0. So no.\n\nThis is really tough. Let's try to see if there's a vertical pattern. Maybe each output column is determined by combining the three rows' pairs in some way.\n\nFor example, in Example0's output column0:\n\nRow0:6\n\nRow1:6\n\nRow2:0.\n\nInput pairs for column0 (each row's first two elements):\n\nRow0:4,4.\n\nRow1:4,0.\n\nRow2:0,0.\n\nPerhaps in a column, if any row has a pair that meets a certain condition, then output 6 for that row.\n\nAlternatively, each output cell is 6 if the corresponding input pair has a 4 in the same row, but any column. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, for each output cell (i,j), look at the pair in input row i at positions 2j and 2j+1. The output is 6 if there's a 4 in 2j or a3 in 2j+1. Let's test this.\n\nExample0's row0, column0:\n\nPair (4,4). 4 is in 2j \u21926. Output6.\n\nColumn1: (0,3). 3 is in 2j+1 \u21926. Output6.\n\nColumn2: (3,0). 3 in 2j \u21926. But output is0. So this doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. But in Example0's third pair, there's a 3 in the first position of the pair. So according to this rule, output would be6, but actual output is0. So invalid.\n\nLet's look for another pattern. In Example0's output, the first two elements are6, and third is0. The corresponding input pairs for those are (4,4), (0,3), (3,0). Maybe the output is6 if the sum of the pair is even. 4+4=8 even \u21926. 0+3=3 odd \u21920. 3+0=3 \u21920. But output is [6,6,0]. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, sum of the pair mod 3. 4+4=8 mod3=2 \u21926? No. Not sure.\n\nWait, the output is always 6 or0. Maybe the rule is that each pair contributes 6 if there's an even number of non-zero elements in the pair. Like:\n\n- If both are non-zero \u2192 even \u21926.\n\n- If one is non-zero \u2192 odd \u21920.\n\nBut in Example0's first pair (4,4) \u2192 two non-zero \u21926. Second pair (0,3) \u2192 one \u21920. Third pair (3,0) \u2192 one \u21920. Output should be [6,0,0], but actual is [6,6,0]. So no.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps the output is 6 if the pair contains a 4 followed by a3, or a3 followed by a4. But in Example0's first pair (4,4), no. Second pair (0,3) \u21923 in second. Third pair (3,0) \u21923 in first. So no, output would be0. But actual is [6,6,0]. So no.\n\nThis is really challenging. Let's try to think of something else. Maybe the output is the count of 4s and3s in each pair, multiplied by 3. For example:\n\nExample0's first pair (4,4) \u2192 two 4s \u2192 count2 \u21922*3=6. Second pair (0,3) \u2192 count1 \u21923. But output is6. So no.\n\nAlternatively, sum the number of 4s and3s in the pair. For Example0's first pair:2 4s \u21922. 2*3=6. Second pair:1 3 \u21921*6=6. Third pair:1 3 \u21926. But output is [6,6,0]. So third pair would be6, but output is0. Doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. Maybe the output is 6 if the pair contains exactly one 4 or one3. \n\nExample0's first pair has two 4s \u2192 no. So output0. But output is6. So no.\n\nAlternative idea: For each pair, if there's a 4 in the first position and a 3 in the second, then 6. Otherwise, 0. But in Example0's first pair, both are4 \u21920. Second pair (0,3) \u21920. Third pair (3,0) \u21920. Output would be all0s, but actual output is [6,6,0]. So no.\n\nAnother approach: Maybe each pair in the input is converted to 6 if the pair is [4,3] or [3,4]. Otherwise, 0. But in Example0's first pair, [4,4] \u21920. Second [0,3]\u21920. Third [3,0]\u21920. So output all0s. But actual is [6,6,0]. So no.\n\nI'm stuck. Let's try to look for a different pattern. Maybe the output is formed by looking at all three input rows for each pair of columns.\n\nFor example, considering the three input rows' column pairs and seeing if there's a 4 and3 in the same positions across the rows.\n\nBut this is getting too vague. Let's try to look at Example2's output:\n\nInput row0: [0,0,4,0,3,0] \u2192 pairs (0,0), (4,0), (3,0). Output [0,6,6].\n\nInput row1: [0,4,4,3,0,3] \u2192 pairs (0,4), (4,3), (0,3). Output [6,6,6].\n\nInput row2: [4,4,0,0,0,3] \u2192 pairs (4,4), (0,0), (0,3). Output [6,6,6].\n\nOutput for row0: [0,6,6].\n\nSo for pair0 of row0 (0,0) \u2192 output0. Pair1 (4,0) \u21926. Pair2 (3,0) \u21926.\n\nWhat's common between pairs that output6 here? For pair1 and pair2 in row0, one element is non-zero (4 and3 respectively). So maybe the rule is that if the pair has at least one non-zero, output6. But then pair0 (0,0) \u21920. So this would fit. But in Example0's third pair (3,0) \u2192 non-zero, but output is0. So this rule isn't consistent.\n\nWait, but in Example0's third pair (3,0), output is0. So why is that?\n\nThis is really puzzling. Let's look at all examples and see if there's a common thread.\n\nLooking at the outputs:\n\n- All output elements are either 0 or6.\n\n- The transformation must be based on the input pairs (since input has six elements per row, output three).\n\nPerhaps each pair is converted to 6 if there's a 4 in the first element and a 3 in the second, regardless of order. So if the pair is (4,3) or (3,4), then 6. Otherwise, 0.\n\nBut in Example0's first pair (4,4) \u2192 no. Second pair (0,3) \u2192 no. Third pair (3,0) \u2192 no. Output would be all0s, but actual is [6,6,0]. So no.\n\nAlternatively, if either element is a4 or a3, then6. So any pair with a4 or3. Example0's first pair has4s \u21926. Second pair has3 \u21926. Third pair has3 \u21926. But output is [6,6,0]. So third pair should be6 but is0. So this rule doesn't fit.\n\nAnother idea: the output is 6 for each pair that has a4 in the first position or a3 in the second position. So:\n\nFor pair (a,b), 6 if a=4 or b=3.\n\nExample0's first pair (4,4) \u2192 a=4 \u21926. Second pair (0,3) \u2192b=3 \u21926. Third pair (3,0) \u2192 neither \u21920. Which matches the output [6,6,0].\n\nTesting this rule with other examples:\n\nExample1's input row0: [4,0,4,3,3,0]. Pairs:\n\nPair1:4,0 \u2192a=4 \u21926.\n\nPair2:4,3 \u2192a=4 \u21926.\n\nPair3:3,0 \u2192a=3 (not4) and b=0 \u21920. But output is6. So this doesn't fit. So the rule is invalid.\n\nHmm. But in Example1's output row0 is [6,6,6]. So third pair must have output6. According to this rule, it would be0. So there's a contradiction.\n\nAnother possibility: a=4 or b=3, or a=3 or b=4.\n\nExample0's first pair:4,4 \u2192 a=4 \u21926.\n\nSecond pair:0,3 \u2192b=3 \u21926.\n\nThird pair:3,0 \u2192a=3 \u21926. But output is0. So no.\n\nExample1's third pair:3,0 \u2192a=3 \u21926. Output is6. So this would fit. But Example0's third pair would have output6, but actual is0. So invalid.\n\nThis is getting me nowhere. Let's try to look for a pattern in the Test Input and possible outputs.\n\nTest Input:\n\nRow0: [0,0,4,0,3,0] \u2192 pairs (0,0), (4,0), (3,0).\n\nRow1: [0,4,0,3,3,3] \u2192 pairs (0,4), (0,3), (3,3).\n\nRow2: [4,0,0,3,0,0] \u2192 pairs (4,0), (0,3), (0,0).\n\nApplying the previous rule (a=4 or b=3):\n\nRow0's pairs:\n\n0,0 \u2192 neither \u21920.\n\n4,0 \u2192a=4 \u21926.\n\n3,0 \u2192a=3 \u21926. So output row0: [0,6,6].\n\nRow1's pairs:\n\n0,4 \u2192b=4 \u2192 no. Unless the rule is a=4 or b=3.\n\nPair1:0,4 \u2192 a=0, b=4 \u2192 no. So 0.\n\nPair2:0,3 \u2192b=3 \u21926.\n\nPair3:3,3 \u2192b=3 \u21926. So output row1: [0,6,6].\n\nRow2's pairs:\n\n4,0 \u2192a=4 \u21926.\n\n0,3 \u2192b=3 \u21926.\n\n0,0 \u2192 neither \u21920. So output row2: [6,6,0].\n\nBut looking at the training examples, like Example2's output for a similar input:\n\nExample2's input row0: [0,0,4,0,3,0] \u2192 output [0,6,6], which matches this rule's output for row0.\n\nBut according to Example2's output, row1's output is [6,6,6]. Let's see:\n\nExample2's input row1: [0,4,4,3,0,3]. Pairs (0,4), (4,3), (0,3).\n\nApplying the rule a=4 or b=3:\n\nPair0:0,4 \u2192a=0, b=4 \u2192 no. But output is6. So this doesn't fit.\n\nSo this rule isn't valid.\n\nHmm. At this point, I think the correct pattern is that for each pair (a, b) in the input row, the output is 6 if a is 4 or b is 3. Otherwise, 0. Even though this doesn't fit all examples, it's possible that this is the intended pattern, and the test input would follow this.\n\nBut wait, let's check Example1's output. In Example1's row0, the third pair is (3,0), a=3 (not4), b=0 (not3) \u2192 output should be0. But actual output is6. So this rule is incorrect.\n\nAlternative idea: Perhaps the output is 6 if the sum of the pair is 7 (4+3). But how?\n\nExample0's first pair:4+4=8 \u21920. But output is6. No.\n\nExample1's third pair:3+0=3 \u21920. Output is6. No.\n\nThis is leading me to think that the pattern is not about sums or individual elements, but perhaps the positions of 4s and3s across the entire grid. For instance, each 4 and3 in the input is mapped to 6 in the output, but in a different position.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each row's output is formed by adding the numbers in pairs and replacing with 6 if there's any non-zero, but this doesn't fit the examples.\n\nAfter struggling for a long time, I think I need to make a guess based on the closest pattern I can find. Based on the Test Input and the training examples, especially Example2 and Example0, perhaps the rule is that each pair contributes 6 if the pair contains a 4 in the first position or a3 in the second position. \n\nApplying this to the Test Input:\n\nRow0: pairs (0,0) \u21920. (4,0) \u21924 in first \u21926. (3,0) \u21923 in first \u21920. So output row0: [0,6,0].\n\nRow1: pairs (0,4) \u21920. (0,3) \u21923 in second \u21926. (3,3) \u21923 in second \u21926. Output row1: [0,6,6].\n\nRow2: pairs (4,0) \u21924 in first \u21926. (0,3) \u21923 in second \u21926. (0,0) \u21920. Output row2: [6,6,0].\n\nBut looking at Example2's output, which has similar inputs, the output rows are [0,6,6], [6,6,6], [6,6,6]. So this doesn't match. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is 6 if either element in the pair is a4 or3. \n\nTest Input row0 pairs: (0,0) \u21920. (4,0) \u21924 \u21926. (3,0) \u21923 \u21926. Output [0,6,6].\n\nRow1: (0,4) \u21924 \u21926. (0,3) \u21923 \u21926. (3,3) \u21923 \u21926. Output [6,6,6].\n\nRow2: (4,0) \u21924 \u21926. (0,3) \u21923 \u21926. (0,0) \u21920. Output [6,6,0].\n\nSo combining these, the output would be:\n\n[0,6,6]\n\n[6,6,6]\n\n[6,6,0]\n\nBut looking at the training examples, this could fit some but not all.\n\nFor example, Example0's first row:\n\nPairs (4,4) \u21924 \u21926. (0,3) \u21923 \u21926. (3,0) \u21923 \u21926. Output should be [6,6,6], but actual output is [6,6,0]. So this doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. This suggests the rule is not simply presence of 4 or3. \n\nAfter hours of trying different approaches and not finding a pattern that fits all examples, I'm going to make an educated guess based on the Test Input and some of the training examples. The answer might be that each pair contributes 6 if the sum of the pair is 4+3=7, but since in Example0's first pair sum is8 and output is6, this doesn't fit. But perhaps the rule is to replace 4s and3s with6 and sum them. For example, each 4 and3 becomes6, then each pair is merged into one cell. If either is6, the output is6. So:\n\nExample0's first pair (4,4) \u21926,6 \u21926.\n\nSecond pair (0,3) \u21920,6 \u21926.\n\nThird pair (3,0) \u21926,0 \u21926.\n\nBut output is [6,6,0]. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, the output is 6 if either element in the pair is non-zero. So any non-zero pair.\n\nBut Example0's third pair (3,0) \u2192 non-zero \u21926, but output is0.\n\nThis is really frustrating. I think I need to look back at the examples and see if there's a vertical pattern. \n\nIn Example0's output:\n\n[6,6,0]\n\n[6,0,0]\n\n[0,0,6]\n\nLooking at the input columns across all three rows:\n\nFor output column0: \n\nRow0:4,4\n\nRow1:4,0\n\nRow2:0,0.\n\nOutput is6,6,0.\n\nPerhaps for each output column, if there's a 4 in the first element of any of the three rows' pairs, output6 in that row. Or something like that. Not sure.\n\nAt this point, I think the correct answer for the Test Input is:\n\n[0,6,6]\n\n[6,6,6]\n\n[6,6,0]\n\nBut I'm not confident. However, based on some of the examples and the Test Input, this seems plausible. For example, in the Test Input's row0, the pairs (0,0), (4,0), (3,0). If the rule is that if the pair contains a4 or3, output6, then (4,0) and (3,0) would be6. So output row0: [0,6,6].\n\nRow1 pairs: (0,4) \u21924 \u21926. (0,3) \u21923 \u21926. (3,3) \u21923 \u21926. So row1 output: [6,6,6].\n\nRow2 pairs: (4,0) \u21924 \u21926. (0,3) \u21923 \u21926. (0,0) \u21920. So row2: [6,6,0].\n\nBut let's check if this fits any training example. Example2's input row0: [0,0,4,0,3,0] \u2192 pairs (0,0), (4,0), (3,0). Output [0,6,6]. Which matches this rule. So this rule seems to fit Example2. But Example0's first row would have pairs (4,4) \u21926. (0,3) \u21926. (3,0) \u21926. Output would be [6,6,6], but actual output is [6,6,0]. So this doesn't fit.\n\nBut maybe the rule is that if the pair contains a4 in the first position or a3 in the second, then6. For Example0's third pair (3,0): a=3 (not4), b=0 (not3) \u21920. So output [6,6,0]. This fits. For Example2's third pair (3,0) \u2192 a=3 \u21920. So output is6. But in Example2's output, the third pair is6. So this doesn't fit.\n\nGiven that I'm stuck, I'll proceed with the rule that each pair contributes6 if there's a4 in the first position or a3 in the second position, and apply it to the Test Input.\n\nTest Input pairs:\n\nRow0:\n\n(0,0) \u2192 no \u21920.\n\n(4,0) \u21924 in first \u21926.\n\n(3,0) \u21923 in first \u2192 no \u21920. But output for row0 third element is6 in Example2's case. So this doesn't fit. \n\nBut perhaps the correct rule is that the output is6 if either element is4 or3. So in Test Input row0's third pair (3,0) \u21923 \u21926. So output would be [0,6,6]. Row1's pairs: (0,4) \u21924 \u21926. (0,3) \u21923 \u21926. (3,3) \u21923 \u21926. Output [6,6,6]. Row2's pairs: (4,0) \u21924 \u21926. (0,3) \u21923 \u21926. (0,0) \u21920. Output [6,6,0].\n\nThis matches the outputs of some training examples like Example2. Therefore, the final answer for the Test Input would be:\n\n[0,6,6]\n\n[6,6,6]\n\n[6,6,0]\n\nBut looking at Example4's output, input row0: [0,0,0,0,3,0] \u2192 pairs (0,0), (0,0), (3,0) \u2192 output [0,6,0]. According to the rule, third pair has3 \u21926, but actual output is0. So this rule is invalid.\n\nTherefore, I must have missed something. Another possibility is that the output is6 if the sum of the pair is 7. For example, 4+3=7 \u21926. 4+4=8 \u2192 no. 3+0=3\u2192 no. So:\n\nTest Input pairs:\n\nRow0: (0,0) \u21920 \u21920. (4,0) \u21924 \u2192 sum4. (3,0) \u21923 \u2192 sum3 \u21920. So row0 output [0,0,0]. But this doesn't fit.\n\nNo, this can't be right.\n\nAfter extensive and failed attempts, I'll make a guess based on the most plausible pattern I can see, even if it doesn't fit all examples. The answer for the Test Input is likely:\n\n[0,6,6]\n\n[6,6,6]\n\n[6,6,0]",

        "cot_2": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. So, the input is a list of lists (three rows each with six elements), and the output is another list of lists (three rows each with three elements). The numbers in the output are either 0 or 6. Hmm.\n\nLooking at Example 0:\n\nInput:\nRow 1: [4,4,0,3,3,0]\nRow 2: [4,0,0,3,0,0]\nRow 3: [0,0,0,0,0,3]\n\nOutput:\nRow 1: [6,6,0]\nRow 2: [6,0,0]\nRow 3: [0,0,6]\n\nWait, the input has six elements per row, and the output has three. Maybe each output element is derived from two adjacent elements in the input. Let's see. For the first row input [4,4,0,3,3,0], the output is [6,6,0]. If we pair the input elements as (4,4), (0,3), (3,0). Then sum each pair: 8, 3, 3. But the output is 6s and 0s. That doesn't align. Alternatively, maybe count how many non-zero pairs there are? Hmm, not sure.\n\nWait, looking at Example 0's output, the first element is 6, which corresponds to the first two elements of the input row (4,4). The second output is 6, which is the next two (0,3) but 0 and 3 sum to 3. Not matching. Alternatively, maybe if both elements in the pair are non-zero, then it's 6, else 0? Let's check.\n\nIn Example 0's first input row: [4,4,0,3,3,0]. The first pair (4,4) both non-zero \u2192 6. Second pair (0,3) has one zero \u2192 0? But the output here is 6. Wait, the output for the second element is 6. So that theory is wrong.\n\nAlternative idea: Each output element is 6 if the sum of the two corresponding input elements is 7 (since 4+3=7). Wait, in Example 0's first input row, pairs are 4+4=8, 0+3=3, 3+0=3. But output is 6,6,0. That doesn't fit. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe each pair is checked for having a 4 and a 3. Let's see. In the first pair of the first input row (4,4) \u2192 two 4s, no 3. But output is 6. Second pair (0,3) has a 3, but no 4. Third pair (3,0) has a 3. But the output has two 6s here. Doesn't fit.\n\nLooking at Example 0's output, the first row in output is [6,6,0]. The input's first row is [4,4,0,3,3,0]. Maybe split into three pairs of two elements each and check if both are 4 or 3. But 4 and 3 are the only non-zero numbers. Let's think: For each pair, if the pair contains at least one 4 and at least one 3, then sum 4+3=7, but how does that become 6?\n\nWait, maybe the sum of each pair is 4+3=7, but output is 6. Maybe 6 is 4+3 minus 1? Not sure. Or maybe, in each pair, if both elements are non-zero and their sum is 7 (4+3), then it's 6. Otherwise, 0. Let's test that.\n\nExample 0, first input row: pairs (4,4) sum to 8 \u2192 not 7 \u2192 0? But output is 6. So that's not right. Hmm.\n\nAlternative approach: Maybe group the elements in the input rows into three groups of two, and count the number of non-zero values in each group. If both are non-zero, then 6; else 0. Let's check.\n\nFirst row in Example 0 input: [4,4,0,3,3,0]. Groups: (4,4) \u2192 two non-zero \u2192 6. (0,3) \u2192 one non-zero \u2192 0. (3,0) \u2192 one non-zero \u2192 0. But the output is [6,6,0]. That doesn't fit. So that's not the pattern.\n\nWait, in Example 0's output first row, the first two groups are 6,6. So maybe the first group is (4,4) \u2192 6, second group (0,3) \u2192 6. How does that make sense?\n\nLooking at another example. Example 1's input first row is [4,0,4,3,3,0]. Output is [6,6,6]. Let's look at the groups. First two elements (4,0) \u2192 one non-zero. Next (4,3) \u2192 both non-zero. Then (3,0) \u2192 one. But output is all 6s. So that approach isn't working.\n\nAlternative idea: Maybe each output position is 6 if the corresponding two input positions (from left to right) in all three rows have at least one 4 and one 3. Let's think in terms of columns across the three input rows.\n\nWait, the output is three elements per row, and the input is six elements per row. So maybe each output element in a row is determined by two columns in the input. For example, output row i, column j is determined by input row i, columns 2j-1 and 2j (assuming zero-based or one-based indexing).\n\nWait, let's take Example 0:\n\nInput rows:\n\nRow 0: [4,4,0,3,3,0]\nRow 1: [4,0,0,3,0,0]\nRow 2: [0,0,0,0,0,3]\n\nOutput rows:\n\nRow 0: [6,6,0]\nRow 1: [6,0,0]\nRow 2: [0,0,6]\n\nIf we split each input row into three pairs:\n\nRow 0 pairs: [4,4], [0,3], [3,0]\nRow 1 pairs: [4,0], [0,3], [0,0]\nRow 2 pairs: [0,0], [0,0], [0,3]\n\nLooking at the output for each pair:\n\nRow 0 output: 6,6,0 \u2192 which would correspond to pairs [4,4], [0,3], [3,0]. Hmm. Why are the first two 6 and the third 0?\n\nMaybe the sum of each pair. 4+4=8, 0+3=3, 3+0=3. But output is 6,6,0. Doesn't match. Alternatively, if the pair contains both 4 and 3. Wait, in the first pair of row 0, it's 4 and 4. So no. But output is 6. So that's not it.\n\nAnother angle: Look for 4s and 3s in the input and their positions. Maybe each 4 and 3 in the input contributes to the output. For example, each 4 in a pair adds a 6, but only if there's a corresponding 3 in the same pair. Or something like that.\n\nWait, let's look at the output for Example 0. The first row of output is [6,6,0]. The input pairs for that row are (4,4), (0,3), (3,0). The 6s are in the first and second positions. So in the first pair (4,4), there are two 4s. Second pair (0,3) has a 3. Third pair (3,0) has a 3. But output is 6,6,0. Maybe the presence of a 4 or 3 in the pair. If the pair has a 4, add 6? But the first pair has two 4s. Or maybe each 4 contributes 3 and each 3 contributes 3, so sum to 6. For example, in the first pair (4,4) \u2192 3+3=6. Second pair (0,3) \u2192 3 \u2192 3? But output is 6. Hmm. Alternatively, each 4 and 3 in the pair counts as a 3 each, so if there's a 4 and 3, sum to 6. But if only 4 or only 3, then 3. But output is 6s and 0s.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each pair is transformed into 6 if there's at least one 4 and one 3 in the pair. Let's check. For Example 0's first pair (4,4) \u2192 no 3. So output should be 0. But the output is 6. So that's not right.\n\nAnother approach: Maybe each 4 in the input is turned into a 3 and each 3 into a 3, and then summed in pairs. So (4,4) \u2192 3+3=6. (0,3) \u2192 0+3=3. (3,0) \u2192 3+0=3. But in Example 0's output, the first two are 6. So that's not matching.\n\nWait, the outputs are all 0 or 6. So perhaps each pair in the input is converted to 6 if there are any non-zero numbers, otherwise 0. But in Example 0's first row, the first pair is 4,4 \u2192 non-zero, so 6. Second pair is 0,3 \u2192 one non-zero \u2192 maybe 6? But why. Or maybe count the number of non-zero elements in the pair. If two, then 6. If one, then 0. If zero, 0. Let's check:\n\nExample 0 first row pairs: (4,4) \u2192 2 \u2192 6. (0,3) \u21921 \u21920. But output is 6,6,0. So no. The second pair in input has one non-zero, but output is 6. So that's not right.\n\nHmm. Let's look at the outputs and see if there's a pattern in the positions. For example, in Example 0, the output has three rows. Each row's elements are 6 or 0. Let's see:\n\nLooking at the input of Example 0, the three rows:\n\nRow1: [4,4,0,3,3,0]\nRow2: [4,0,0,3,0,0]\nRow3: [0,0,0,0,0,3]\n\nThe output is:\n\n[6,6,0]\n[6,0,0]\n[0,0,6]\n\nMaybe each column in the output corresponds to two columns in the input. For instance, output column 0 is determined by input columns 0 and 1 across all three rows. Let's see.\n\nFor output column 0 in Example 0:\n\nLooking at input columns 0 and 1 across all three rows:\n\nRow1: 4,4 \u2192 sum 8.\nRow2: 4,0 \u2192 sum 4.\nRow3: 0,0 \u2192 sum 0.\n\nBut output column 0 is 6,6,0. How does that relate?\n\nAlternatively, if in any of the three rows, the pair of columns has a 4 and a 3, then output is 6. Wait, but in column 0 and 1 of the input for row1, it's 4 and 4. No 3. So why output 6 here? That might not be it.\n\nWait, maybe each 4 in the input is converted to 3 and each 3 to 3, then sum each pair. But then (4,4) becomes 3+3=6. (0,3) becomes 0+3=3, but output is 6. Hmm, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe for each pair in the input row, if there's a 4 and a 3 in any of the three rows for that pair's position, then the output for that position in each row is 6. Let's see.\n\nTake the first pair (columns 0 and 1) across all three input rows:\n\nRow1: 4,4 \u2192 two 4s.\nRow2: 4,0 \u2192 4 and 0.\nRow3: 0,0 \u2192 zeros.\n\nBut the output for column 0 in each row is:\n\nRow1:6, Row2:6, Row3:0.\n\nSo how does that come about? If any of the three rows has a 4 and a 3 in that pair, but in this case, none of the rows have a 3 in columns 0-1. So this idea might not work.\n\nWait, maybe it's looking for the presence of 4 and 3 in the same pair across all rows. For example, if in any row's pair there's a 4 and 3, then output 6 for that position. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is determined by adding the corresponding pairs in the input rows. For example, each output cell is the sum of the three corresponding pairs across the rows. Wait, but how?\n\nLet's take the first output position (first element in each row) in Example 0:\n\nFor output row 0's first element 6: the input's row0's first pair is [4,4], row1's first pair is [4,0], row2's first pair is [0,0]. If we sum the pairs across rows: 4+4+4+0+0+0=8. But output is 6. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each pair in the input is converted to 6 if there's at least one 4 and one 3 in that pair. But in Example 0's first pair [4,4], there's no 3, so output should be 0. But output is 6. So that's not it.\n\nAnother angle: The output might be the sum of the count of 4s and 3s in each pair across all three rows. For example, for each pair position (like first pair in all rows), count the number of 4s and 3s. If the total is even, 6, else 0? Not sure.\n\nTake the first pair (columns 0 and 1) across all three rows in Example 0:\n\nRow0: 4,4 \u2192 two 4s.\nRow1:4,0 \u2192 one 4.\nRow2:0,0 \u2192 none.\nTotal 4s: 3. 3s:0. Sum is 3. How does that become 6? Not clear.\n\nWait, maybe each 4 and 3 in the input is converted to 3 in the output, and then summed per pair. So for each pair in the input row, sum 3 for each 4 or 3. So if a pair has two 4s, sum to 6. If a pair has one 4 and one 3, sum to 6. If a pair has a 4 and a 0, sum to 3. Etc.\n\nLet's test this idea.\n\nExample0, first input row: [4,4,0,3,3,0]\n\nFirst pair (4,4) \u2192 3+3=6 \u2192 output 6.\nSecond pair (0,3) \u2192 0+3=3 \u2192 output 3, but output is 6. So that's not matching.\n\nHmm. Alternatively, each 4 and 3 is converted to 3, and if any of the three rows has a pair sum of 6 (two 3s), then output 6. Maybe the output is 6 if any of the three rows has a pair sum of 6. But how does this work for each output cell.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each output cell is 6 if the sum of all elements in that pair across all three input rows is 7 (like 4+3) multiplied by the number of occurrences. Not sure.\n\nAnother idea: Look at the test input and see if applying a certain pattern gives the expected output.\n\nTest input:\n\n[0, 0, 4, 0, 3, 0]\n[0, 4, 0, 3, 3, 3]\n[4, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0]\n\nIf we split each row into three pairs:\n\nRow0: [0,0], [4,0], [3,0]\nRow1: [0,4], [0,3], [3,3]\nRow2: [4,0], [0,3], [0,0]\n\nPossible output for each pair:\n\nLooking at the output examples, maybe if the pair contains a 4 and a 3 in any order, or two of the same number (4,4 or 3,3), then 6. Otherwise, 0.\n\nWait, let's check Example0:\n\nRow0's first pair (4,4) \u2192 6. Second pair (0,3) \u2192 6. Third pair (3,0) \u21920. Hmm. So why does the second pair give 6? Because there's a 3. But first pair gives 6 for two 4s. So perhaps the rule is: if the pair has any non-zero elements, sum them and if they are either 4+4=8, 3+3=6, or 4+3=7, then 6. But 3+3=6 would be 6? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the presence of a 4 or a 3 in the pair. For each pair, if there's at least one 4 or 3, output 6. Otherwise, 0. But that would make all non-zero pairs have 6. Let's see:\n\nIn Example0, first pair (4,4) \u2192 yes \u21926. Second pair (0,3) \u2192 yes \u21926. Third pair (3,0) \u2192 yes \u21926. But output third element is 0. So that's not right.\n\nAlternatively, if the pair has two 4s or two 3s, or a 4 and a 3 \u2192 6. Otherwise, 0. Let's test this.\n\nExample0's first pair (4,4) \u2192 two 4s \u21926. Second pair (0,3) \u2192 has a 3 but no 4 \u21920. But output is 6 here. So that's not correct.\n\nHmm. This is tricky. Let's look at Example1:\n\nInput:\nRow0: [4,0,4,3,3,0]\nRow1: [4,0,0,3,0,0]\nRow2: [0,0,4,3,0,0]\n\nOutput:\n[6,6,6]\n[6,0,0]\n[6,0,6]\n\nRow0's pairs: (4,0), (4,3), (3,0)\nRow1's pairs: (4,0), (0,3), (0,0)\nRow2's pairs: (0,0), (4,3), (0,0)\n\nOutput for Row0: [6,6,6]. So first pair (4,0) \u2192 6. Second pair (4,3) \u21926. Third pair (3,0) \u21926. So according to this, even if the pair has one non-zero (4 or 3) and a zero, it's 6. But that contradicts Example0's third pair, which had (3,0) but output was 0.\n\nWait, in Example0, the third pair of row0 is (3,0), but output is 0. But in Example1's row0, third pair is (3,0) and output is 6. So why the difference?\n\nAh, maybe there's something else. Let's look at the columns across all three rows. For example, each output element corresponds to a pair across all three rows. For example, the first output element for each row is determined by the first pair of each input row. So, for the first output position (column 0), looking at the first pairs of all three input rows.\n\nIn Example0, the first pairs across the three rows are:\n\nRow0: [4,4]\nRow1: [4,0]\nRow2: [0,0]\n\nThe output for row0, column0 is 6, row1, column0 is 6, row2, column0 is 0.\n\nHmm. How are these determined? Maybe for each row in the output, the value is 6 if any of the three input rows have a non-zero sum in that pair. But that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each output cell is 6 if in the corresponding pair of the input row, there are two non-zero elements (regardless of value). So in Example0's row0, first pair (4,4) \u2192 two non-zero \u21926. Second pair (0,3) \u2192 one non-zero \u21920. But output is 6. So that's not it.\n\nWait, but in Example0's row0, second pair (0,3) \u2192 output is 6. But according to this rule, that's only one non-zero. So that's not.\n\nAlternative idea: For each pair in the input row, if there's a 4 and/or a 3 in the pair, sum their count. If the count is two (both elements are 4 or 3), then 6. Otherwise, 0. But in Example0's row0, second pair (0,3) has one 3 \u2192 count 1 \u2192 output 0. But the output is 6. So no.\n\nWait, maybe the output is 6 if the pair contains at least one 4 and at least one 3. So, a pair like (4,3) \u2192 yes. But (4,4) would not. But in Example0's first pair (4,4), output is 6, which would not fit.\n\nAlternatively, if the pair contains any 4 or 3, then 6. So any pair with at least one non-zero (since all non-zero in input are 4 or 3) becomes 6. Then, for Example0's row0, all three pairs have at least one non-zero, so output would be [6,6,6], but the actual output is [6,6,0]. So that's not right.\n\nHmm. Let's try a different approach. Looking at the output rows, they have three elements. Maybe each output element is the sum of the two elements in the input pair, but mapped as 4\u21923 and 3\u21923, then added. For example, 4+4 \u21923+3=6. 4+3\u21923+3=6. 3+3=3+3=6. 0+3\u21920+3=3. But in Example0's row0, second pair (0,3) \u21923, which would not be 6, but the output is 6. So that's not it.\n\nWait, maybe each 4 or 3 in the input is considered as contributing 3 to the output. So each pair's sum is (number of 4s + number of 3s) \u00d73. For example, pair (4,4) \u2192 2\u00d73=6. Pair (0,3) \u21921\u00d73=3 \u2192 output 3. But Example0's output for that is 6. Doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, the sum of each pair, but replacing 4 and 3 with 3. So (4,4) \u21923+3=6. (4,3)\u21923+3=6. (3,3)\u21923+3=6. (0,3)\u21920+3=3. But output in Example0's row0 second pair is 6, but according to this, it's 3. So no.\n\nMaybe the output is 6 for each pair where there's at least one 4 and at least one 3 in the same pair across any of the three input rows. Let's see.\n\nTake the first pair (columns 0 and 1) in Example0's input:\n\nRow0: 4,4 \u2192 two 4s.\nRow1:4,0 \u21924 and 0.\nRow2:0,0 \u2192 zeros.\n\nNone of these pairs have a 3. So output would be 0. But in Example0's output, the first element is 6. So that's not right.\n\nAnother idea: The output is generated by combining the three input rows into a single row, summing the columns. Wait, but input has three rows, each with six elements. Let's see.\n\nFor example, sum each column across all three rows. For Example0:\n\nColumns 0: 4+4+0=8\nColumn1:4+0+0=4\nColumn2:0+0+0=0\nColumn3:3+3+0=6\nColumn4:3+0+0=3\nColumn5:0+0+3=3\n\nBut the output is three elements. Maybe sum pairs of columns in the summed input. For example, columns 0+1, 2+3, 4+5. Sum would be 8+4=12, 0+6=6, 3+3=6. But output is [6,6,0]. Doesn't match.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the sum of each pair of columns across all three rows, then if the sum is 7 (4+3) or 8 (4+4) or 6 (3+3), then output 6. Otherwise, 0.\n\nIn Example0:\n\nSum of columns 0 and 1: 8+4=12 \u2192 not matching. So this doesn't work.\n\nHmm. This is getting frustrating. Let's try to find another pattern.\n\nLooking at Example0's input and output:\n\nInput rows:\n\nRow0: [4,4,0,3,3,0] \u2192 output [6,6,0]\nRow1: [4,0,0,3,0,0] \u2192 output [6,0,0]\nRow2: [0,0,0,0,0,3] \u2192 output [0,0,6]\n\nOutput for each row seems to have 6s in positions where the input row's pairs have 4s and 3s. Let's see:\n\nRow0's output is [6,6,0]. The pairs are [4,4], [0,3], [3,0]. The first pair has two 4s \u2192 6. The second pair has a 3 \u2192 6. The third pair has a 3 \u2192 0. But why?\n\nWait, maybe for each pair in the input row, if the sum is 7 (4+3) or 8 (4+4) or 6 (3+3), then output 6. But in Example0's row0:\n\nFirst pair sum 8 \u21926.\nSecond pair sum 3 \u2192 not 6,7,8 \u21920. But output is 6.\nThird pair sum 3 \u21920. Output is 0.\n\nThis doesn't fit.\n\nAnother angle: The output is determined by the presence of 4 in the first element of the pair and 3 in the second element. So, for each pair (a,b), if a=4 and b=3, output 6. Or if a=3 and b=4. But in Example0's row0 first pair (4,4), that's not the case. Output is 6.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pair is considered as a 6 if there's a 4 in any position and a 3 in any position in the same pair across any row. Wait, for example, the first pair in all three rows:\n\nRow0:4,4\nRow1:4,0\nRow2:0,0\n\nNo 3s in any of these pairs. But output for row0's first element is 6. So that's not it.\n\nAnother idea: Maybe each 4 and 3 in the input is converted to a 6, but split across the output. For example, each 4 in the input contributes a 6 to the corresponding output cell, and each 3 also contributes a 6. But how?\n\nFor example, if the input is split into three pairs per row, each pair's output is 6 if there's at least one 4 or 3 in the pair. But in Example0's row0, the first pair has 4s \u21926, the second pair has a 3 \u21926, third pair has a 3 \u21926. But output is [6,6,0]. So that's not matching.\n\nWait, maybe the output is 6 if the pair has non-zero elements in all three rows. Let's take the first pair (columns 0 and 1) across all three rows in Example0:\n\nRow0 has 4,4 \u2192 non-zero.\nRow1 has4,0 \u2192 non-zero.\nRow2 has 0,0 \u2192 zero.\n\nSo output for first column of row0 is 6. How does this relate? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the output for each cell is 6 if the corresponding pair in that row has any non-zero elements, and also the same pair in another row has non-zero elements. For example, if two rows have non-zero in the same pair, then output 6. But this is getting complicated.\n\nAnother observation: All the output examples have either 0 or 6. So the transformation must be converting certain conditions to 6, others to 0.\n\nLooking at the test input:\n\nTest input rows:\n\nRow0: [0,0,4,0,3,0]\nRow1: [0,4,0,3,3,3]\nRow2: [4,0,0,3,0,0]\n\nSplit into pairs:\n\nRow0: [0,0], [4,0], [3,0]\nRow1: [0,4], [0,3], [3,3]\nRow2: [4,0], [0,3], [0,0]\n\nNow, if we try to find the pattern, perhaps the output is 6 for each pair that contains a 4 and a 3 in the same pair in any row. But let's check.\n\nFor example, the first pair in Row0 is [0,0] \u2192 no. In Row1, [0,4] \u2192 has a 4 but no 3. Row2's first pair is [4,0] \u2192 has a 4. But none of these pairs have both 4 and 3, so output for first position would be 0. But perhaps the output is 6 if any of the rows' pairs have both 4 and 3. Looking at all pairs in the test input:\n\nRow0's pairs: [0,0], [4,0], [3,0] \u2192 none have both 4 and3.\nRow1's pairs: [0,4] \u21924, no 3; [0,3] \u21923; [3,3] \u2192 two 3s.\nRow2's pairs: [4,0], [0,3], [0,0] \u2192 no 4 and3 pairs.\n\nSo none of the pairs have both 4 and3. But according to some examples, like Example1's first row has a pair (4,3) which becomes 6. But in this case, no such pairs. So the output might be all zeros. But that's probably not correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is 6 for each pair that has non-zero elements in that row, and there's at least one 4 and one 3 in the entire column across all rows.\n\nWait, this is getting too convoluted. Let's try to think of a different approach.\n\nLooking at Example0's output:\n\nOutput rows:\n\n[6,6,0]\n[6,0,0]\n[0,0,6]\n\nEach output row has three elements, and the input rows are split into three pairs each. Let's see:\n\nFor each row in input, each pair's output is 6 if the pair contains two 4s, two 3s, or a 4 and a 3. Otherwise, 0.\n\nTesting this for Example0:\n\nRow0's pairs:\n\n[4,4] \u2192 two 4s \u21926.\n[0,3] \u2192 has a 3, but no 4 \u21920. But output is6.\nSo this doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. Maybe the rule is that each pair's output is 6 if there is at least one 4 and/or 3 in the pair. But then, in Example0's row0, the third pair [3,0] would become6, but output is0. So that's not.\n\nAnother thought: Looking at the output rows, maybe each output row is a combination of the three input rows. For instance, the output's first row is derived from the first input row's pairs, the second output row from the second input row's pairs, etc. But how?\n\nAlternatively, each output element is 6 if the corresponding pair in that row's input has any non-zero elements. So for each pair in the input row, if any of the two elements is non-zero, output 6. Otherwise, 0.\n\nBut in Example0's row0, third pair [3,0] has a non-zero \u21926. But output is0. So that's not right.\n\nWait, what if the output for a pair is 6 only if both elements in the pair are non-zero. So:\n\nPair with two non-zeros \u21926.\nOtherwise \u21920.\n\nChecking Example0:\n\nRow0's pairs:\n\n[4,4] \u21926.\n[0,3] \u21920 (since one is zero).\n[3,0] \u21920.\nSo output would be [6,0,0]. But the actual output is [6,6,0]. So this doesn't fit.\n\nExample0's row0 output is [6,6,0], so the second pair must be 6. But according to this rule, it's 0. So no.\n\nAnother idea: The output is 6 if the sum of the pair is 7 (4+3), 8 (4+4), or 6 (3+3). Otherwise 0.\n\nIn Example0's row0 first pair sum is 8 \u21926. Second pair sum is 3 \u21920. But output is6. So no.\n\nHmm. I'm stuck. Maybe I should look for a pattern in how the output elements are arranged based on the input.\n\nAnother observation: In all the examples, the output rows are the same length as the input rows divided by two. So 6 elements become 3. So each output element corresponds to two input elements.\n\nLooking at Example0's row0 input: [4,4,0,3,3,0] \u2192 output [6,6,0]. The output elements correspond to pairs (4,4), (0,3), (3,0). Now, the sum of each pair is 8,3,3. The output is 6,6,0. There's no direct relation. But maybe the count of 4s and 3s in the pair. For example:\n\nEach pair's 4s and 3s are counted, and if the count is even, then 6. If odd, 0. But 4s and 3s are both non-zero. Let's see:\n\nExample0 row0 first pair: two 4s \u2192 count 2 \u2192 even \u21926. Second pair: one 3 \u2192 count 1 \u2192 odd \u21920. But output is6. So no.\n\nAlternatively, if the pair has an even number of non-zero elements, output 6. Otherwise 0. For example:\n\nRow0's first pair: two non-zero \u21926. Second pair: one \u21920. Third pair: one \u21920. But output is [6,6,0]. So that's not matching.\n\nExample1's row0 input: [4,0,4,3,3,0]. Pairs (4,0), (4,3), (3,0). First pair: one non-zero \u21920. But output is6. So this doesn't work.\n\nMaybe the output is 6 if any of the three input rows have a non-zero in both elements of the pair. For example, for each pair position (e.g., first pair across all rows), if any of the rows has both elements non-zero, then output 6 for all rows in that position. Wait, but how would that determine individual row outputs.\n\nAlternatively, for each pair position, if any of the rows has a non-zero pair, then output 6 for all rows in that position. But this would make all columns have 6 if any row has a non-zero pair. But in Example0's third pair, row0's third pair is (3,0) \u2192 one non-zero. Row2's third pair is (0,3) \u2192 one non-zero. So no row has a non-zero pair here. But output for row0's third element is0, row2's third is6. So that's not matching.\n\nI'm really stuck. Let's try to think of the outputs in terms of the input's 4s and 3s.\n\nIn Example0's input:\n\nRow0: 4,4,0,3,3,0 \u2192 4s at positions 0,1 and 3,4 (wait no, positions 0 and1 are 4s, positions 3 and4 are 3s). Output row0 is [6,6,0]. Maybe each output element corresponds to two input elements, and if there's a 4 and a 3 in any of the pairs across the three rows, it's 6. Or something like that.\n\nAnother observation: The output seems to have 6s in positions where the corresponding input pairs have either two 4s, two 3s, or a 4 and a 3. Let's check:\n\nExample0's row0, first pair (4,4) \u2192 two 4s \u21926. Second pair (0,3) \u2192 has a 3 \u21926. Third pair (3,0) \u21923 \u21920. But why the second pair is 6 and third is 0?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is 6 for a pair if the pair in that row contains at least one 4 or 3, and there's a corresponding pair in another row that also has a 4 or 3. Like a vertical check.\n\nFor example, in Example0's row0 first pair (4,4), row1's first pair is (4,0). So there are 4s in two rows for this pair. So output for this pair in all rows is 6. But row2's first pair is (0,0), but output is6 for row0 and row1, and 0 for row2. Not sure.\n\nThis is taking too long. Let's try to see the test input and possible output.\n\nTest input:\n\nRow0: [0,0,4,0,3,0]\nRow1: [0,4,0,3,3,3]\nRow2: [4,0,0,3,0,0]\n\nSplit into pairs:\n\nRow0: [0,0], [4,0], [3,0]\nRow1: [0,4], [0,3], [3,3]\nRow2: [4,0], [0,3], [0,0]\n\nPossible output:\n\nLooking at the training examples, perhaps each pair is 6 if there's a 4 and/or 3 in the pair, but considering all three rows vertically. For example, if in any row's pair there's a 4 and/or 3, then output 6 for that pair in all rows. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, for each vertical triplet of pairs (across all three rows), if any of them has a 4 and/or 3, output 6. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the output is 6 for each pair in a row if that pair in the input row has a non-zero element (since all non-zero are 4 or 3). So:\n\nTest input row0 pairs: [0,0] \u21920, [4,0] \u21926, [3,0] \u21926. So output row0: [0,6,6].\nRow1 pairs: [0,4] \u21926, [0,3] \u21926, [3,3] \u21926. So output row1: [6,6,6].\nRow2 pairs: [4,0] \u21926, [0,3] \u21926, [0,0] \u21920. Output row2: [6,6,0].\n\nBut looking at the training examples, for example, Example0's row0's second pair [0,3] would become6, which matches the output. So maybe the rule is: for each pair in the input row, output 6 if there's at least one non-zero (4 or 3) in the pair. Otherwise, 0.\n\nBut in Example0's row0 third pair [3,0] \u2192 output is0. But according to this rule, it should be6. So that's conflicting. What's different about Example0's third pair? Let's check Example0's output for row0: [6,6,0]. The third pair is [3,0], which has a non-zero. So according to the rule, output should be6, but it's 0. So this can't be right.\n\nBut in Example3's input:\n\nInput row0: [4,4,0,3,0,0]\nSplit into pairs: (4,4), (0,3), (0,0). Output is [6,6,0]. The third pair is 0,0 \u2192 output 0. So that fits. But if the pair has a non-zero, like (3,0), then output would be6. But in Example0's row0 third pair (3,0), output is0. So this rule is not correct.\n\nAnother possible pattern: The output is 6 if the sum of the two elements in the pair is divisible by 3. For example:\n\nExample0's row0 first pair 4+4=8 \u21928%3=2 \u21920. But output is6. So no.\n\nAlternatively, the output is 6 if the pair has even number of non-zero elements. So two non-zero \u21926, one \u21920. But Example0's row0 second pair has one non-zero \u21920. But output is6. So that's not.\n\nThis is really challenging. Let's try to see if there's a pattern in the output rows when compared to the input rows' non-zero positions.\n\nFor Example0's output:\n\nRow0: [6,6,0] \u2192 input pairs [4,4], [0,3], [3,0]. The first two pairs have non-zero elements. Third pair has one. But output is0.\n\nRow1 output: [6,0,0]. Input pairs [4,0], [0,3], [0,0]. Only first pair has non-zero. So output6 for first, 0 for others.\n\nRow2 output: [0,0,6]. Input pairs [0,0], [0,0], [0,3]. Only third pair has non-zero. So output6 for third.\n\nWait, this seems like the output is 6 for each pair that has non-zero elements in that row's pair. But why in Example0's row0, the second pair [0,3] has a non-zero (3), so output is6. Third pair [3,0] has a non-zero (3), output is0. That contradicts.\n\nUnless there's a vertical component. For example, a pair in the output is 6 if that pair in the same row's input has non-zero, and there's at least one other row where the same pair position also has non-zero.\n\nFor example, in Example0:\n\nRow0's first pair [4,4] (non-zero). Row1's first pair [4,0] (non-zero). So output for first pair in all rows is6 if their own pair is non-zero and another row's pair is non-zero.\n\nBut for Row0's second pair [0,3] (non-zero). Row1's second pair [0,3] (non-zero). So output for row0's second pair is6. Row1's second pair is0, because row0's second pair is non-zero. This seems complicated.\n\nAlternatively, for each pair position (like first pair across all three rows), if any of the rows has a non-zero pair, then all rows have 6 in that position if their own pair has non-zero.\n\nFor example, Example0's first pair position:\n\nRow0: [4,4] \u2192 non-zero.\n\nRow1: [4,0] \u2192 non-zero.\n\nRow2: [0,0] \u2192 zero.\n\nSo for first pair position, output for rows0 and1 is6, row2 is0.\n\nSimilarly, second pair position:\n\nRow0: [0,3] \u2192 non-zero.\n\nRow1: [0,3] \u2192 non-zero.\n\nRow2: [0,0] \u2192 zero.\n\nSo output for rows0 and1 is6, row2 is0.\n\nThird pair position:\n\nRow0: [3,0] \u2192 non-zero.\n\nRow1: [0,0] \u2192 zero.\n\nRow2: [0,3] \u2192 non-zero.\n\nSo output for rows0 and2 is6, row1 is0.\n\nBut the actual output for Example0 is:\n\nRow0: [6,6,0]\n\nRow1: [6,0,0]\n\nRow2: [0,0,6]\n\nThis doesn't match. For example, third pair position has non-zero in row0 and row2, so their outputs would be6. But row0's output is0 for third position, row2's is6. So this theory isn't correct.\n\nI'm really stuck. Maybe I should look at the sum of the input pairs across all three rows.\n\nFor Example0:\n\nFirst pair across rows:\n\nRow0:4+4=8.\n\nRow1:4+0=4.\n\nRow2:0+0=0.\n\nSum total: 12. Output for first position: rows0 and1 have6, row2 0. Not sure.\n\nAnother idea: For each pair position, sum the number of 4s and 3s across all three rows. If the sum is even, output 6; else 0. But Example0's first pair position:\n\nRow0: two 4s.\n\nRow1: one4.\n\nRow2: zero.\n\nTotal 4s:3. 3s:0. Total 3 \u2192 odd. Output is6. So this theory doesn't fit.\n\nAt this point, I think I need to make a guess based on the test input.\n\nTest input pairs:\n\nRow0: [0,0], [4,0], [3,0]\n\nRow1: [0,4], [0,3], [3,3]\n\nRow2: [4,0], [0,3], [0,0]\n\nAssuming the pattern is: For each pair in the input row, output 6 if the pair contains a 4 and a 3 (in any order) or two 4s or two 3s. Otherwise, 0.\n\nBut let's check:\n\nRow0's first pair [0,0] \u21920.\n\nSecond pair [4,0] \u2192 only 4 \u21920.\n\nThird pair [3,0] \u21923\u21920.\n\nSo output row0 would be [0,0,0]. But looking at the training examples, this might not be correct.\n\nAlternatively, if the pair has any non-zero elements (4 or 3), output6. So:\n\nRow0's pairs: [0,0] \u21920, [4,0] \u21926, [3,0] \u21926 \u2192 output [0,6,6].\n\nRow1's pairs: [0,4] \u21926, [0,3] \u21926, [3,3] \u21926 \u2192 output [6,6,6].\n\nRow2's pairs: [4,0] \u21926, [0,3] \u21926, [0,0] \u21920 \u2192 output [6,6,0].\n\nBut looking at the training examples:\n\nExample0's row0 third pair [3,0] has a non-zero \u21926, but output is0. So this can't be the rule.\n\nAlternatively, the rule is that a pair in the input row is 6 if the sum of the pair is 4+3=7, 4+4=8, or 3+3=6. Then, output 6. Otherwise 0.\n\nTest input:\n\nRow0's pairs:\n\n[0,0] sum 0 \u21920.\n\n[4,0] sum4 \u21920.\n\n[3,0] sum3 \u21920.\n\nSo output row0: [0,0,0].\n\nRow1's pairs:\n\n[0,4] sum4 \u21920.\n\n[0,3] sum3 \u21920.\n\n[3,3] sum6 \u21926.\n\nSo output row1: [0,0,6].\n\nRow2's pairs:\n\n[4,0] sum4 \u21920.\n\n[0,3] sum3 \u21920.\n\n[0,0] sum0 \u21920.\n\nOutput row2: [0,0,0].\n\nBut this doesn't match any training examples. For example, Example0's row0 first pair sum8 \u21926, which fits, but second pair sum3 \u21920, but output is6. So this isn't right.\n\nI'm really stuck. Maybe the pattern is that each pair in the input row is converted to 6 if there's at least one 4 in the pair, or at least one 3 in the pair. But this would make almost all pairs 6. But in Example0's row0 third pair (3,0) \u21926, but output is0. So that's not.\n\nAnother possibility: The output for each pair is 6 if the pair contains a 4 in any row's corresponding pair and a 3 in any row's corresponding pair. For example, for each pair position (e.g., first pair across all three rows), if any row has a 4 and another row has a 3 in that position, then output 6 for all rows in that position.\n\nBut in Example0's first pair position:\n\nRow0:4,4.\n\nRow1:4,0.\n\nRow2:0,0.\n\nSo in this position, there are 4s in rows0 and1, but no 3s. So output would be0. But the output is6 for rows0 and1. So this doesn't fit.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and not finding the pattern, I'll have to make an educated guess based on the test input and the examples. Looking at the examples, it seems like each pair in the output is 6 if there's a 4 or 3 in that pair and there's a corresponding pair in another row that has a 4 or 3. \n\nAlternatively, the output is 6 for each pair that has non-zero elements in the same position in any row. For example, if the first pair in any row has non-zero, then all rows' first pair in output is6 if their own pair is non-zero. \n\nBut this is just a guess. Looking at the test input:\n\nRow0's pairs: [0,0] (zero), [4,0] (has 4), [3,0] (has3).\n\nRow1's pairs: [0,4] (has4), [0,3] (has3), [3,3] (has3).\n\nRow2's pairs: [4,0] (has4), [0,3] (has3), [0,0] (zero).\n\nApplying the rule where each pair in the output is 6 if the input pair has any non-zero (4 or 3):\n\nRow0: [0,6,6]\n\nRow1: [6,6,6]\n\nRow2: [6,6,0]\n\nLooking at the training examples, this seems to fit some cases but not others. For example, Example0's row0 third pair (3,0) would output6, but the actual output is0. However, maybe the correct pattern is different.\n\nAlternatively, the output is 6 for a pair if the sum of the pair in the input row is greater than or equal to 3. But 4+0=4 \u22653 \u21926, 3+0=3 \u22653 \u21926. So test input row0 would be [0,6,6].\n\nBut Example0's row0 third pair is3+0=3 \u21926, but output is0. So this is conflicting.\n\nAnother possibility: Each 4 in the input is replaced by 3, each 3 by 3, and 0 by 0. Then each pair's sum is converted to 6 if the sum is 6 or 3, but this seems arbitrary.\n\nAt this point, given the time I've spent and not finding a clear pattern, I'll have to make an educated guess based on the test input and the examples. Given that the output elements are 6 when there's a combination of 4s and 3s, and the test input has several such pairs, the output might be:\n\nRow0: [0,6,6]\n\nRow1: [6,6,6]\n\nRow2: [6,6,0]\n\nBut looking at the training examples, this might align with Example2's output.\n\nBut I'm not confident. However, based on the test input pairs and the examples, the output could be:\n\n[0,6,6]\n\n[6,6,6]\n\n[6,6,0]"
