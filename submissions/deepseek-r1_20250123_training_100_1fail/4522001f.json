        "cot_1": "Okay, let's see. I need to figure out the pattern that transforms the input matrices into the output matrices in the training examples. Then apply that pattern to the test input.\n\nLooking at Example 0 first. The input is a 3x3 matrix:\n\n[3, 3, 0]\n[3, 2, 0]\n[0, 0, 0]\n\nAnd the output is a 9x9 matrix. Let me check the output dimensions. The output for Example 0 has 9 rows, each with 9 elements. So it's a 9x9 matrix. So the transformation seems to be expanding each element into a 3x3 block? Wait, but the input is 3x3, and the output is 9x9. So 3x3 each element becomes a 3x3 block, making 3*3=9. But the output here is 9x9. So each element in the input is being replaced by a 3x3 block in the output. But the example 0's output isn't just 3x3 blocks of the same number. Let's look closer.\n\nIn Example 0's input, the first row is [3,3,0]. The output's first four rows are all [3,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,0]. Then rows 5-8 start with 0s, then 3s, etc. Wait, maybe the pattern is that each element in the input is expanded into a 3x3 block, but the value in that block depends on the original element and perhaps its position?\n\nWait, let's check. The input has a 3 at position (0,0) (assuming rows and columns start at 0). The output's first four rows start with 3s. Wait, but how does the input element map to the output blocks. Maybe the input's (i,j) element is turned into a 3x3 block in the output, but the value of that block is determined by the input's element's value. But in example 0, the input has 3s and 0s, and a 2 in the middle.\n\nLooking at the output for example 0: The first four rows (rows 0-3) all start with four 3s, then five 0s. Then rows 4-7 start with four 0s, then four 3s, then a 0. The last row is all 0s.\n\nWait, maybe the output is constructed by taking each element in the input matrix and replacing it with a 3x3 block. But the way the blocks are arranged is such that the original positions are scaled by 3. For example, the input's (0,0) element (3) becomes the top-left 3x3 block in the output. But in example 0's output, the top-left 3x3 area is 3s. Wait, but the output's first four rows are 3s in the first four columns. Wait, perhaps the expansion is 3x3 per input element, but each input element's block is 3x3? So 3 input rows, each with 3 elements, become 3*3=9 rows, each with 3*3=9 elements. So the output is a 9x9 matrix where each input element is replaced by a 3x3 block.\n\nBut how does the value of the input element determine the value in the output block? Let's look at Example 0. The input has elements 3, 3, 0 in the first row. The output's first four rows (maybe first 3 rows?) but in example 0's output, the first four rows (each of 9 elements) start with four 3s. Hmm, maybe each input element's value determines the number of rows or columns in the block. Alternatively, maybe the input element's value is the number of rows or columns filled with that value.\n\nWait in Example 0, the input's first row is [3,3,0]. The output's first four rows have four 3s followed by five 0s. Wait, 3+3+0=6, but that might not be relevant. Alternatively, maybe the input element's value determines how many rows or columns in the output block are filled with that number. Wait, the first input row's elements are 3,3,0. Let's look at how their blocks are arranged. For the first element, which is 3, the output's first four rows start with four 3s. Wait, 3+1=4? Because 3+1=4 rows. Hmm, but not sure. Alternatively, maybe the input value is the length of a square in the output. Like a 3x3 block, but for a value of 3, it's a 4x4 block? But example 0's first input element is 3, and in the output, the first four rows and four columns are 3s. So a 4x4 block of 3s. Then the next input element in the first row is 3, which would also be a 4x4 block. But then how do they fit?\n\nWait the input is 3x3. If each element is expanded into a 3x3 block in the output, then the output would be 9x9. But in the output, the structure seems to have larger blocks. Like, in example 0's output, the first four rows are all 3s in the first four columns. Then the next four rows (4-7) have 3s starting at column 4. So maybe each input element is being replaced by a square block of size (value+1) x (value+1), filled with the value. Wait, let's see:\n\nIn Example 0, the input matrix is:\n\nRow 0: [3,3,0]\n\nRow 1: [3,2,0]\n\nRow 2: [0,0,0]\n\nThe output's first four rows have 3s in the first four columns. Then the next four columns (columns 4-7) are zeros. Then the next five columns (assuming 9 elements) \u2014 no, in the first row of output, it's [3,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,0], so columns 0-3 are 3s, columns 4-8 are 0s. Then in row 4 of output, it's [0,0,0,0,3,3,3,3,0]. So columns 4-7 are 3s. Then columns 8 is 0.\n\nSo perhaps each input element is replaced by a (value +1) x (value +1) block. Let's see: For input element 3, value +1 is 4. So a 4x4 block of 3s. But how are these blocks arranged? Because if each input element's block is placed next to each other, perhaps overlapping? But how does the 4x4 fit into the 9x9 grid.\n\nWait, the input's (0,0) is 3. So the block would be 4x4. Then input's (0,1) is 3, another 4x4 block. But since the first block starts at position (0,0) in the output, the next block (for (0,1)) would start at column 4. So 0+4=4. But then input's (0,1) is in column 1 of the input. So for output, the x position would be sum of previous blocks' widths. For input element at (i,j), the output block starts at row i*3 and column j*3, and is of size (value+1)x(value+1). Wait, but 3x3? Or perhaps not. Let's check.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each input cell is split into a 3x3 grid in the output. So for each input cell (i,j), the corresponding 3x3 block in the output starts at row i*3, column j*3. Then the value of the input cell determines how many cells in that 3x3 block are filled with the input value, but perhaps in a specific pattern. For example, if the input is 3, then all 3x3 cells are filled except one? Or maybe the input number is the count of how many cells in the 3x3 block are set to that number, but in a particular arrangement.\n\nWait, looking at Example 0's input, the element (0,0) is 3. In the output, the first four rows (rows 0-3) have four 3s in the first four columns. That's not a 3x3 block. Wait, perhaps the pattern is different. Let me re-express the output of Example 0.\n\nIn Example 0's output:\n\nRows 0-3: Each starts with four 3s followed by five 0s.\n\nThen rows 4-7: Each starts with four 0s, then four 3s, then a 0.\n\nRow 8: All zeros.\n\nSo the output can be divided into three vertical sections (columns 0-3, 4-7, 8) and three horizontal sections (rows 0-3, 4-7, 8). Wait, but columns 0-3 are four columns, 4-7 are four columns, then column 8. Similarly for rows. So perhaps each input row corresponds to four rows in the output, except the last row. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the input matrix's elements are being used to create a grid where each element's value determines the size of a square in the output. For example, if an input element is 3, then it creates a 4x4 square (since 3+1=4) in the output. Then these squares are arranged in the output grid. But how?\n\nIn Example 0's input, the first row is [3,3,0]. So two 4x4 squares (from the 3s) and a 0. The output's first four rows and four columns are 3s (the first 4x4 square). Then next four columns (4-7) would be another 4x4 square. But the input's (0,1) is 3, which would start at column 4 (since the first block is 4 columns) and rows 0-3. Then columns 4-7 in rows 0-3 would be 3s. But in the actual output, rows 0-3 have four 3s followed by five 0s. So columns 0-3 are 3s, then 4-8 are 0s. That doesn't match. So maybe this approach is incorrect.\n\nWait, looking at the input's (1,1) element, which is 2. Then in the output, maybe that's a 3x3 square? Because 2+1=3. So in the input, (1,1) is 2, which would be in the middle. Let's see. In the output, rows 4-7 and columns 4-7: rows 4-7 have four rows. Each of those rows has 0s in columns 0-3, then 3s in 4-7. Wait, but the input's (1,1) is 2. So maybe the 2 is leading to a 3x3 square. But in the output, rows 4-7 (four rows) and columns 4-7 (four columns) of 3s. That's 4x4 again. So maybe my previous idea is wrong.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the value in the input represents how many times to repeat a certain pattern. For example, the 3 in the input could mean that the corresponding block in the output is repeated three times in a certain direction. But I'm not sure.\n\nLooking at Example 1's input:\n\nInput is:\n\n[0,0,0]\n[0,2,3]\n[0,3,3]\n\nOutput is a 9x9 matrix. Let's see the structure. The first row is all zeros. Then rows 1-4 have 3s in columns 1-4. Rows 5-8 have 3s starting at column 5. But the last row is part of the output's ninth row, which is all zeros.\n\nHmm. So in Example 1's output, the non-zero areas are in rows 1-4 (four rows) and columns 1-4 (four columns) filled with 3s, then rows 5-8 (four rows) and columns 5-8 (four columns) filled with 3s. So each 4x4 block of 3s, separated by zeros.\n\nWait, perhaps the input matrix's elements (excluding the zeros) determine the positions of these 4x4 blocks in the output. For example, in Example 1's input, the 2 is at (1,1) and the 3s are at (1,2), (2,1), (2,2). The output has two 4x4 blocks of 3s. The first block is in rows 1-4, columns 1-4. The second is rows 5-8, columns 5-8. So perhaps each non-zero input element contributes to the positioning of these blocks. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the input's non-zero elements are used to create a grid where each such element is replaced by a 4x4 block (since the output blocks are 4x4) in a position determined by their original position. For example, if the input has a non-zero at (i,j), then the output has a 4x4 block starting at (i*4, j*4). But in Example 0, input's (0,0) has 3, which would start at (0,0) in the output. But the output's first four rows and four columns are 3s, which fits. Then input's (0,1) is 3, so starting at column 4 (0+4) and row 0. So columns 4-7 would be 3s. But in Example 0's output, the first row has four 3s, then 0s. So that's not matching. Hmm.\n\nWait in Example 0's input, the first row is [3,3,0]. If each 3 in the input results in a 4x4 block, then (0,0) and (0,1) would each create a 4x4 block. The first would start at (0,0) and span columns 0-3, rows 0-3. The next starts at (0,4) (since the first block is 4 columns) but in the input's (0,1) is column 1. Wait, maybe each input cell's position (i,j) determines the block's position in the output as (i*3, j*3), but that's 3x3 blocks. Then each input cell's value determines the size of the block. Like, if the value is n, then the block is (n+1)x(n+1). So for 3, it's 4x4. Then in Example 0, (0,0) has value 3, so a 4x4 block starting at (0,0). Then (0,1) has value 3, so a 4x4 block starting at (0, 3). But columns 3 to 6 would be covered. But then the output's first row would have 3s from 0-3 and 3-6 columns, leading to 0-6 columns being 3s. But in the actual output, the first row has four 3s (columns 0-3) followed by 0s. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the input's (i,j) element's value is the number of rows and columns the block occupies. So a value of 3 would create a 3x3 block. But in Example 0's output, the first four rows are filled with 3s. That's four rows, which is more than 3. So that doesn't align.\n\nAnother approach: looking at the input and output for Example 0 and 1, perhaps the output is constructed by taking each row of the input and expanding it vertically and horizontally according to the value of each element. For example, each element in the input row is replicated (value + 1) times horizontally and (value + 1) times vertically. Wait, for example, if an element is 3, then it's replicated 4 times in both directions.\n\nLooking at Example 0's first input row [3,3,0]. The first element is 3, so replicated 4 times horizontally and 4 times vertically. The second element 3 is also replicated 4 times. The third element 0 is replicated 1 time. So the row would be 3 3 3 3 | 3 3 3 3 | 0. So the entire row would be 4+4+1=9 elements. Then vertically, each row is replicated 4 times. Then the next input row [3,2,0] would be 3 replicated 4 times, then 2+1=3 times, then 0 once. So 4+3+1=8? Wait, but the output is 9 elements per row. Hmm, maybe this is not the case.\n\nWait in Example 0's output, the first four rows are all [3,3,3,3, 0,0,0,0,0]. Wait, but the input's first row is [3,3,0]. If the first two elements (3 and 3) are each expanded to 4 elements, and the third (0) to 1 element. But 4 +4 +1=9 columns. Then each row in the input would produce a row in the output with these expanded elements, and then each such row is replicated (value +1) times vertically. So for example, the first input row [3,3,0] would be expanded to [3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,0], then replicated 4 times (since the first element is 3, 3+1=4 times). But then the next row of the input [3,2,0] would be expanded as 3,3,3,3; 2,2,2; 0. So total 4+3+2? No, that adds up to 9. Wait 3's expansion is 4 elements, 2's is 3 elements, 0 is 1. 4+3+1=8? No, 4+3+1=8, which isn't 9. Hmm, that's a problem.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each element in the input is expanded into (value +1) elements, and then each row in the input is expanded into (max value in row +1) rows. But that's getting complicated.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is a Kronecker product of the input matrix with some kernel matrix. For example, each element is multiplied by a kernel. But in Example 0's input, there's a 2 in the middle. The output has 3s in certain blocks. So perhaps the kernel is a matrix that depends on the input element's value. For example, if the input element is 3, the kernel is a 3x3 matrix of 3s. But then the output would have 3s where the input was 3, but scaled. But in Example 0's output, there are 3s in larger blocks than 3x3.\n\nAlternatively, the pattern could be that the output is a 3x3 grid of blocks, each block being (value +1) x (value +1), but arranged in a way that overlaps. But I'm not sure.\n\nWait, let's think about the positions in the output. For Example 0's output, the first four rows and columns are 3s. Then rows 4-7, columns 4-7 are 3s. The rest are 0s. So two 4x4 blocks of 3s. That suggests that the input's (0,0) and (1,1) elements are 3 and 2, but how do they contribute?\n\nWait, the input for Example 0 is:\n\nRow 0: 3,3,0\n\nRow 1:3,2,0\n\nRow 2:0,0,0\n\nIn the output, the first 4 rows and columns are 3s, then rows 4-7 and columns 4-7 are 3s. That could be two blocks: the first at (0,0) and the second at (4,4). But how does that relate to the input.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each input element's value determines the distance of a block from the top-left corner. For example, a value of 3 might mean that the block is placed 3 units away. But this seems unclear.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the input represents some kind of fractal or recursive pattern. For example, each 3 in the input leads to a certain pattern in the output, and the output itself is built from smaller copies of the input's structure. But given the examples, this is hard to see.\n\nAnother angle: in Example 0's output, the two blocks of 3s are 4x4 each. The first is at the top-left, covering rows 0-3 and columns 0-3. The second is in the middle, rows 4-7 and columns 4-7. The total output is 9x9. So 4x4 blocks separated by a row and column of zeros.\n\nIn Example 1's output, the two blocks are in rows 1-4 (columns 1-4) and rows 5-8 (columns5-8). So shifted by one row and column compared to Example 0. Why?\n\nLooking at the input of Example 1:\n\nInput is:\n\n[0,0,0]\n\n[0,2,3]\n\n[0,3,3]\n\nSo the non-zero elements are in positions (1,1) (2), (1,2) (3), (2,1) (3), (2,2) (3). The output has two 4x4 blocks. The first starts at row 1, column 1, and the second starts at row 5, column5. So perhaps each non-zero element in the input contributes to the position of a block in the output. For example, (i,j) in input corresponds to a block starting at (i*4, j*4) in the output. But in Example 0, (0,0) would start at (0,0) and be 4x4, which matches. Then (0,1) would start at (0,4), but in Example 0's output, there's no such block. So that's not correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the input's (i,j) determines the block's position as (i*3, j*3) in the output. Then the block is (value+1)x(value+1) in size. For Example 0's (0,0) 3: starts at (0,0), size 4x4. So covers rows 0-3, columns 0-3. Then (0,1) 3: starts at (0,3), size 4x4. So rows 0-3, columns 3-6. But in Example 0's output, the first row is 3,3,3,3 followed by zeros. So columns 0-3 are 3s, and columns 4-8 are zeros. So this doesn't fit, because (0,1) would start at column 3 and go to 6. But in the output, columns 3-6 are covered by (0,0)'s block (columns 0-3) and (0,1)'s block would start at column 3. So overlapping. So that may not be the case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the input is a grid that represents the positions and sizes of squares in the output. For example, each non-zero element in the input indicates a square of size (value+1)x(value+1) at a position determined by its coordinates. But again, how to translate input coordinates to output coordinates.\n\nWait, in Example 0's output, there are two 4x4 blocks of 3s. The first is at (0,0), the second at (4,4). If the input's (0,0) and (1,1) are 3 and 2 respectively, then perhaps the position is (i*4, j*4). So (0,0) \u2192 (0,0), (1,1) \u2192 (4,4). But then the block for (1,1) would be 3x3 (since value is 2 \u2192 3x3). But in the output, it's 4x4. Hmm. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the input's elements determine the size of the squares, and the squares are arranged diagonally. In Example 0's output, there's a 4x4 square at (0,0), then another 4x4 at (4,4), which is diagonally placed. So perhaps each non-zero element in the input's diagonal leads to a square in the output's diagonal. But the input's (0,0) and (1,1) are non-zero. (0,0) is 3, (1,1) is 2. So in the output, two squares: 4x4 (for 3) and 3x3 (for 2). But in the output of Example 0, the second block is 4x4, which contradicts this.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Maybe I should look for a pattern in how the input's elements are transformed into blocks in the output.\n\nAnother observation: in both examples, the output has blocks of 3s. The input contains 3s, 2s, and 0s. The output blocks are 4x4 for input elements of 3 and 2? Because in Example 1's input, the 2 leads to a 4x4 block in the output. Because in Example 1's output, there's a block at (1-4,1-4) which is 4 rows and columns. The input's (1,1) is 2. So maybe the value is increased by 1, so 2 becomes 3, and the block is 3x3. But then why is it 4x4?\n\nWait, maybe the value in the input is the number of rows and columns to fill, not the size. For example, if the input is 3, then fill 3+1=4 rows and columns. So for input value 3, the block is 4x4. For input value 2, the block is 3x3. But in Example 0, the input's (1,1) is 2. Looking at the output, rows 4-7 and columns 4-7 are 3s. That's 4 rows and columns. So that suggests that even the 2 is being treated as 3+1=4. That doesn't make sense.\n\nAlternatively, maybe all non-zero elements are replaced with 3, and then the output is formed by creating 4x4 blocks for each non-zero input element. But in Example 0's input, there are elements with 3, 3, 3, 2, etc. But the output blocks are all 3s. So maybe the input's value is irrelevant except for being non-zero, and each non-zero element is replaced by a 4x4 block of 3s. But then, why in Example 0's output, there's a block at (4,4) of 3s. The input's (1,1) is 2, which is non-zero, so it would create a 4x4 block. But in the output, that block is 4x4 of 3s. So perhaps the value is ignored, and any non-zero element in the input creates a 4x4 block of 3s at the position determined by (i*4, j*4).\n\nBut in Example 0's input, (0,0) is 3 \u2192 block at (0,0) to (3,3). (0,1) is 3 \u2192 block at (0,4) to (3,7). (1,0) is 3 \u2192 block at (4,0) to (7,3). (1,1) is 2 \u2192 block at (4,4) to (7,7). Then (0,2) and (1,2) are 0, so no blocks. (2,0), (2,1), (2,2) are 0. So the output would have four 4x4 blocks. But Example 0's output only has two such blocks. So that doesn't fit.\n\nBut Example 0's output has two 4x4 blocks. The first at (0,0) and the second at (4,4). So maybe only elements along the diagonal are considered. But the input's (0,0) and (1,1) are non-zero. (0,0) is 3, (1,1) is 2. So their positions in the input are (i,i), which in the output become blocks starting at (i*4, i*4). Then (0,0) \u2192 0*4=0, so block (0,0) to (3,3). (1,1) \u2192 4,4 to 7,7. Then (2,2) is 0, so no block. So this would explain Example 0's output. But Example 1's input has non-zero elements at (1,1) (2), (1,2) (3), (2,1) (3), (2,2) (3). So only (1,1) is diagonal. But the output of Example 1 has two 4x4 blocks at positions (1,1) and (5,5). So maybe for each diagonal element in the input, a block is placed in the output at (i*4, i*4). For Example 1's input, the diagonal elements are (0,0) 0, (1,1) 2, (2,2) 3. So non-zero elements are (1,1) and (2,2). Then their blocks would start at (4,4) and (8,8). But in Example 1's output, the blocks are at (1-4,1-4) and (5-8,5-8). So that doesn't align with i*4.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the block's position is determined by the input's row and column. For example, each non-zero element in the input at (i,j) creates a block in the output starting at (i*4, j*4). So for Example 0's (0,0) \u2192 (0,0) block. (0,1) \u2192 (0,4) block. But in the output of Example 0, there's no block at (0,4). So this seems incorrect.\n\nAnother thought: the output is a larger grid where each input cell corresponds to a 3x3 grid in the output. Then, within each 3x3 grid, the value is filled in certain positions based on the input value. For example, if the input is 3, then all 3 cells in a row or column are filled. But this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the input's value represents the number of concentric squares in the output. For example, value 3 means three concentric squares, leading to a larger filled area. But this seems unclear.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the output matrices, they consist of 4x4 blocks of 3s and the rest zeros. The number of such blocks corresponds to the number of non-zero elements in the input. For Example 0's input, there are four non-zero elements (3,3,3,2). But the output has two 4x4 blocks. So maybe not.\n\nAnother approach: compare the input and output for both examples.\n\nExample 0's input has three 3s and a 2. The output has two 4x4 blocks of 3s.\n\nExample 1's input has a 2 and three 3s. The output has two 4x4 blocks of 3s.\n\nSo perhaps the pattern is that each input's non-zero elements contribute to the creation of two 4x4 blocks in the output. But how?\n\nAlternatively, the output is formed by taking each non-zero element in the input, and creating a 4x4 block of 3s in the output at a position determined by the element's value. For example, if the element is 3, the block is placed in the upper-left part; if the element is 2, it's placed lower. But this is vague.\n\nWait, in Example 0's output, the two blocks are at the top-left and middle. In Example 1's output, the two blocks are shifted down and right. The test input is:\n\n[0,3,3]\n\n[0,2,3]\n\n[0,0,0]\n\nWhich has non-zero elements at (0,1), (0,2), (1,1), (1,2). So perhaps each pair of non-zero elements in the input contributes to a block in the output. For example, the first two non-zero elements form the first block, and the next two form the second. But this is speculative.\n\nAlternatively, the output is formed by arranging the non-zero elements of the input into two 4x4 blocks, positioned diagonally. For example, in Example 0, the blocks are at top-left and middle. In Example 1, they're at positions (1,1) and (5,5). But how to determine their positions.\n\nAlternatively, the output is a combination of the input matrix's rows and columns expanded in a way that their elements determine the size of filled blocks. For instance, each row is expanded into 9 rows, and each column into 9 columns. But how.\n\nAnother observation: in both examples, the output matrix's size is 9x9. The input is 3x3. 3*3=9. So perhaps each element in the input is transformed into a 3x3 block in the output. For example, input element (i,j) becomes a 3x3 block in the output at (i*3, j*3). The content of this block depends on the input value. \n\nLooking at Example 0's input, the element (0,0) is 3. The output's first three rows and three columns would be a 3x3 block. But the output's first four rows and four columns are filled with 3s, which is larger than 3x3. So this approach may not fit.\n\nAlternatively, each input element's value determines the size of a square block in the output. For instance, a value of 3 corresponds to a 4x4 block (3+1), and a value of 2 corresponds to a 3x3 block. These blocks are placed in the output such that their starting positions are determined by the input's coordinates multiplied by the block size. \n\nFor Example 0's input:\n\n- (0,0) has value 3 \u2192 4x4 block at (0*4, 0*4) = (0,0)\n- (0,1) has value 3 \u2192 4x4 block at (0*4, 1*4) = (0,4)\n- (1,0) has value 3 \u2192 4x4 block at (1*4, 0*4) = (4,0)\n- (1,1) has value 2 \u2192 3x3 block at (1*4,1*4) = (4,4)\n- Other elements are 0, so no blocks.\n\nBut the output of Example 0 has two 4x4 blocks. This approach would create multiple blocks which don't align with the example's output. So this seems incorrect.\n\nGiven that I'm struggling to find the pattern, perhaps I should look for other relationships. Let's compare the input and output dimensions. Input is 3x3, output is 9x9. So each dimension is tripled. Therefore, each element in the input is replaced by a 3x3 block in the output. \n\nNow, what determines the content of each 3x3 block in the output? \n\nFor example, in Example 0's input, element (0,0) is 3. The corresponding 3x3 block in the output is filled with 3s. Similarly, element (0,1) is 3 \u2192 filled with 3s. Element (0,2) is 0 \u2192 filled with 0s. \n\nBut looking at Example 0's output, the first three rows (0-2) would correspond to the first input row. However, the output's first four rows are all 3s. So this doesn't align with a direct 3x3 block replacement.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each input element's value determines how many rows and columns in the output are filled. For example, a value of 3 would mean that the next 3 rows and columns are filled. But in Example 0's first row, the first two elements are 3, so 3 rows and 3 columns filled with 3s. But the output has four rows filled, so this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, the value in the input represents the number of consecutive rows and columns to fill in the output. For instance, 3 means fill 3 rows and 3 columns. But in Example 0's output, the first four rows and columns are filled. So maybe value+1. For input 3, 3+1=4 rows and columns. \n\nIf that's the case, then each input element (i,j) with value v causes a (v+1)x(v+1) block to be filled in the output. The position of this block is determined by summing the previous elements' sizes. \n\nFor example, in Example 0's input:\n\nRow 0: [3,3,0]\n\nThe first element is 3 \u2192 4x4 block. Starts at (0,0).\n\nSecond element is 3 \u2192 next column starts at 0+4=4. So 4x4 block from column 4 to 7.\n\nThird element is 0 \u2192 1x1 block, so column 8.\n\nSimilarly, rows would be cumulative. The first row of the input is row 0. The first element's block is 4 rows tall (v=3+1=4). So the next input row's blocks would start at row 4.\n\nThis aligns with Example 0's output. Let's check:\n\nInput row 0:\n\n3,3,0 \u2192 4x4, 4x4, 1x1. So columns 0-3, 4-7, 8. Each of these would be in rows 0-3.\n\nInput row 1:\n\n3,2,0 \u2192 4x4 (v=3+1=4), 3x3 (v=2+1=3), 1x1. These would start at row 4 (since previous input row's block was 4 rows tall). So row 4-7 for this input row. Columns 0-3 for first element (3), columns 4-6 for second (2), column 7 for third (0).\n\nBut in Example 0's output, the rows 4-7 have four rows where columns 4-7 are 3s. So perhaps the second input row's elements are:\n\nRow 1, column 0: 3 \u2192 4x4 block in rows 4-7, columns 0-3. But in the output, rows 4-7 have 0s in columns 0-3. Hmm, this contradicts.\n\nWait, according to this hypothesis, the first input row's elements are processed left to right, each contributing a block of (v+1) columns. The next input row's elements would start after the previous row's cumulative height.\n\nBut perhaps this approach is not correct. Let's try applying this hypothesis to Example 0's input:\n\nInput row 0: [3,3,0]\n\nEach element's block width is 4,4,1 columns. So columns 0-3, 4-7, 8.\n\nThe height for this row would be 4 rows (max v+1 in the row? Or sum? Or each element's block has its own height? Not sure.\n\nIf each element's block has height (v+1), then the first element's block would be 4 rows tall, covering rows 0-3. The second element's block would be 4 rows tall, also rows 0-3. The third is 1 row.\n\nBut that would mean that the first input row's elements are stacked vertically, which doesn't match the output. \n\nAlternatively, each input element's block is placed in the output such that each row in the input corresponds to a section in the output's rows, and each column in the input corresponds to a section in the output's columns. For example, each input row is expanded into (max value in row +1) rows, and each input column into (max value in column +1) columns. But this seems complicated.\n\nAlternatively, the output is constructed by expanding each input element into a (value+1) x (value+1) block and arranging them in a grid, but overlapping is allowed.\n\nBut in Example 0's output, the first four rows and four columns are 3s. This would correspond to the first input element (3), expanded to 4x4. The second input element (3) would be another 4x4 block, but placed next to the first. So columns 4-7. But in Example 0's output, the first four rows have columns 0-3 as 3s and 4-7 as 0s. So this doesn't fit.\n\nI think I'm stuck. Maybe I should look for a different approach. Let's compare the input and output for both examples to see if there's a common transformation.\n\nIn Example 0:\n\nInput:\nRow 0: [3,3,0]\nRow 1: [3,2,0]\nRow 2: [0,0,0]\n\nOutput is a 9x9 matrix with two 4x4 blocks of 3s. One at the top-left (rows 0-3, cols 0-3), and another starting at row 4, col4 (rows4-7, cols4-7). The rest are 0s.\n\nIn Example 1:\n\nInput:\nRow 0: [0,0,0]\nRow 1: [0,2,3]\nRow 2: [0,3,3]\n\nOutput is a 9x9 matrix with two 4x4 blocks of 3s. The first starts at row1, col1 (rows1-4, cols1-4), and the second starts at row5, col5 (rows5-8, cols5-8).\n\nNoticing a pattern: the blocks are positioned at coordinates that are multiples of 4. In Example 0, blocks at (0,0) and (4,4). In Example 1, blocks at (1*4-3,1*4-3) = (1,1) and (5,5). But how does this relate to the input?\n\nAlternatively, the blocks are positioned at (i*4, j*4) where (i,j) are the positions of the input elements. But in Example 0, the input's (0,0) and (1,1) elements are non-zero. Their positions (0,0) and (1,1) would lead to blocks at (0,0) and (4,4), which matches Example 0's output. In Example 1's input, non-zero elements are at (1,1), (1,2), (2,1), (2,2). The positions (1,1) would lead to (4,4), but the output's first block is at (1,1). Hmm, maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, each non-zero element in the input contributes to a block in the output positioned at (i*4 - (v), j*4 - (v)), where v is the value. But this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, the position of the blocks is determined by the sum of the values in the input up to that row and column. For example, for each element (i,j), the block starts at (sum of previous rows' values, sum of previous columns' values). But this would require summing the values, which in Example 0's first row sums to 6 (3+3+0), which doesn't fit.\n\nAnother observation: the output for Example 0 has two 4x4 blocks, and the input has two elements with value 3. Example 1's output has two 4x4 blocks, and the input has three elements with value 3 and one with 2. So maybe the number of 4x4 blocks is not directly related to the number of input elements.\n\nPerhaps the key is that the output is a kind of magnification where each input cell is replaced by a 3x3 cell in the output, but the values inside are determined by the input cell's value. For instance, if the input cell is 3, the output cell's 3x3 block is filled with 3s; if it's 2, filled with 2s; 0 with 0s. But in Example 0's output, the first four rows are filled with 3s, which would require that multiple input cells' blocks are merged.\n\nAlternatively, each input cell is expanded into a 3x3 block in the output. Then, the output is created by overlaying these blocks, and where multiple values are present, the maximum value is taken. But how this would work with the given examples.\n\nFor Example 0:\n\nInput row 0: 3,3,0.\n\nEach 3 is replaced with a 3x3 block of 3s. 0 replaced with 0s. The output's first row would have two 3x3 blocks of 3s (from the two 3s) and a 3x3 block of 0s. So the first three rows would be 3s in columns 0-5 and 0s in 6-8. But the actual output for Example 0 has the first four rows as 3s in columns 0-3. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each input cell is replaced with a 3x3 block where the number of 3s (or the value) depends on the input cell's value. For example, if the input is 3, the block is filled with 3s. If the input is 2, the block is filled with 3s but smaller. But I'm not sure.\n\nGiven that I'm not making progress with these approaches, perhaps I should look for another pattern. Let's think about the output matrices' structures.\n\nIn Example 0's output, there are two 4x4 blocks of 3s. The first starts at (0,0), the second at (4,4). The output is 9x9, so the last row and column are 0s.\n\nIn Example 1's output, the blocks start at (1,1) and (5,5). So each block is shifted by 1 row and column compared to Example 0.\n\nWhat's the difference between the inputs of Example 0 and 1? Example 0's input has non-zero elements in the first two rows, whereas Example 1's non-zero elements are in the second row and third row. \n\nThe test input is:\n\n[0,3,3]\n\n[0,2,3]\n\n[0,0,0]\n\nWhich has non-zero elements in the first and second rows. So perhaps the pattern is that the blocks are placed at positions based on the row and column indices of the input's non-zero elements. For example, each non-zero element in row i and column j places a 4x4 block starting at (i*4, j*4). \n\nBut in Example 0's input, the non-zero elements are at (0,0), (0,1), (1,0), (1,1). So their blocks would be at:\n\n(0*4, 0*4) \u2192 (0,0)\n\n(0*4, 1*4) \u2192 (0,4)\n\n(1*4, 0*4) \u2192 (4,0)\n\n(1*4, 1*4) \u2192 (4,4)\n\nBut Example 0's output has blocks at (0,0) and (4,4) only. The other two blocks would be at (0,4) and (4,0), but in the output, those areas are filled with zeros. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, the blocks are placed only for elements on the diagonal of the input matrix. In Example 0, the diagonal elements are (0,0)=3, (1,1)=2, (2,2)=0. So only (0,0) and (1,1) are non-zero. Their blocks are placed at (0,0) and (4,4) in the output, which matches Example 0's output. \n\nIn Example 1, the diagonal elements are (0,0)=0, (1,1)=2, (2,2)=3. So non-zero elements at (1,1) and (2,2). Their blocks would be placed at (4,4) and (8,8). But Example 1's output has blocks at (1,1) and (5,5). So this doesn't fit.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps the output blocks are positioned based on the cumulative sum of the input elements' values. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, each non-zero element in the input causes a 4x4 block of 3s to be placed in the output, and the position is determined by the element's coordinates multiplied by 4. So for (i,j) in the input, the block starts at (i*4, j*4). \n\nExample 0's (0,0) \u2192 (0,0), block 0-3,0-3.\n\n(0,1) \u2192 (0,4), block 0-3,4-7.\n\n(1,0) \u2192 (4,0), block4-7,0-3.\n\n(1,1) \u2192 (4,4), block4-7,4-7.\n\nBut in Example 0's output, only the blocks at (0,0) and (4,4) are present, the others are zeros. So this implies that only the diagonal elements are considered. But in Example 0's input, (0,0), (1,1) are non-zero, and their blocks are at (0,0) and (4,4). The other non-zero elements (0,1) and (1,0) are not in the output. So perhaps only the diagonal elements are considered. But in Example 1's input, the diagonal elements are (0,0) 0, (1,1) 2, (2,2) 3. The non-zero ones are (1,1) and (2,2). Their blocks would be at (4,4) and (8,8). But in Example 1's output, the blocks are at (1,1) and (5,5), which don't align. So this theory is incorrect.\n\nAnother observation: in the output matrices, the 4x4 blocks are placed at positions that are one row and column apart from the previous example. For Example 0, they're at (0,0) and (4,4). For Example 1, they're at (1,1) and (5,5). So perhaps the starting position is determined by the number of leading zeros in the input. For Example 0, there are no leading zeros in the first row, so block starts at (0,0). For Example 1, the first non-zero element is in row 1, column 1, so the block starts at (1,1). But how this would translate to the test input.\n\nThe test input is:\n\n[0,3,3]\n\n[0,2,3]\n\n[0,0,0]\n\nThe first non-zero elements are in row 0, column 1 and 2. So perhaps the first block starts at (0,1*4=4) but that doesn't fit. Alternatively, the blocks are placed based on the positions of the non-zero elements. For example, the first non-zero element in the input (row 0, column 1) would start a block at (0,4), and the next at (0,4+4=8). But the output needs to be 9x9. This is unclear.\n\nAt this point, I'm going to take a different approach. Maybe the pattern is that each input element's value is replaced by a square of size (value+1) x (value+1) filled with 3s, placed in the output such that their top-left corner is at (i*3, j*3). \n\nSo for example, input element (i,j) of value v becomes a (v+1)x(v+1) block of 3s starting at row i*3, column j*3. \n\nLet's test this for Example 0:\n\nInput (0,0) is 3 \u2192 block starts at (0*3=0, 0*3=0), size 4x4. So rows 0-3, columns 0-3.\n\nInput (0,1) is 3 \u2192 starts at (0, 3), size 4x4 \u2192 rows 0-3, columns 3-6.\n\nInput (1,0) is 3 \u2192 starts at (3,0), size 4x4 \u2192 rows 3-6, columns 0-3.\n\nInput (1,1) is 2 \u2192 starts at (3,3), size 3x3 \u2192 rows 3-5, columns 3-5.\n\nOther elements are 0 \u2192 size 1x1 of 0.\n\nBut the output of Example 0 has two 4x4 blocks of 3s. The first at (0,0) and the second at (4,4). So this theory doesn't explain that. However, if overlapping occurs, the overlapping areas may have higher values. But in the examples, all blocks are 3s and the rest are 0s. So overlapping would just be 3s.\n\nBut according to this hypothesis, the output would have multiple overlapping blocks. But the actual output for Example 0 has two separate blocks. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each input element's value determines the number of 3x3 blocks placed in the output, but arranged in a way that forms larger blocks. For example, a value of 3 means four 3x3 blocks arranged in a 2x2 grid. But this is speculative.\n\nGiven that I'm not making progress, perhaps I should look for differences between the input and output that aren't size-related. For example, in Example 0's input, there are three 3s and a 2, and the output has two 4x4 blocks of 3s. In Example 1's input, there's a 2 and three 3s, and the output has two 4x4 blocks of 3s. So the 2 in the input doesn't contribute to the block size. Maybe all non-zero elements are treated as 3s. So the output blocks are 4x4 regardless of the input value. \n\nThen the position of the blocks is determined by the coordinates of the non-zero elements in the input. For example, each non-zero element (i,j) in the input creates a 4x4 block starting at (i*4, j*4). \n\nIn Example 0's input, non-zero elements are (0,0), (0,1), (1,0), (1,1). Their blocks would be at (0,0), (0,4), (4,0), (4,4). But the output only has blocks at (0,0) and (4,4). So perhaps only elements where i == j (diagonal) are considered. In Example 0, (0,0) and (1,1) are diagonal. So their blocks are at (0,0) and (4,4), which matches the output. In Example 1's input, the non-zero elements are (1,1), (1,2), (2,1), (2,2). Only (1,1) and (2,2) are diagonal. Their blocks would be at (4,4) and (8,8). But Example 1's output has blocks at (1,1) and (5,5). So this doesn't align.\n\nAlternatively, the position is determined by the sum of the input element's row and column indices. For example, for (i,j), the block starts at (i+j)*4. But this doesn't fit.\n\nAfter extensive brainstorming, I'm still not finding the pattern. Perhaps I should look at the output matrices as a combination of two 4x4 blocks positioned at (i*4, j*4) where i and j are derived from the input's non-zero elements. For the test input, which has non-zero elements at (0,1), (0,2), (1,1), (1,2), the blocks might be placed at (0,4) and (4,8), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, the test input's output will have two 4x4 blocks of 3s, similar to the examples, but positioned based on the input's non-zero elements.\n\nGiven the time I've spent without success, I'll try to make an educated guess. The output seems to have two 4x4 blocks of 3s. Their positions are determined by the input's first two non-zero elements. For the test input, the first non-zero element is at (0,1) and (0,2), but perhaps the blocks are placed at (0,4) and (4,8). But how this fits into a 9x9 grid.\n\nAlternatively, the blocks are placed at positions that are multiples of 4 minus 3. For example, in Example 0, blocks at (0,0) and (4,4). In Example 1, blocks at (1,1) and (5,5). For the test input, perhaps blocks are at (0,1) and (4,5), but that's not multiples of 4.\n\nAlternatively, the blocks are positioned based on the indices of the first two non-zero elements in the input. For the test input, the first non-zero element is (0,1), so the block starts at (0,1*4=4). The next non-zero is (0,2) \u2192 block starts at (0,8). But the output would need to be larger than 9x9. So this is impossible.\n\nGiven that I'm stuck, I'll look at the test input and see what the expected output would be based on the previous examples.\n\nTest input:\n\n[0,3,3]\n\n[0,2,3]\n\n[0,0,0]\n\nComparing to Example 1's input:\n\nExample 1's input is:\n\nRow0: [0,0,0]\n\nRow1: [0,2,3]\n\nRow2: [0,3,3]\n\nTest input's Row0 is [0,3,3], Row1: [0,2,3], Row2: [0,0,0].\n\nIn Example 1's output, the blocks are at (1-4,1-4) and (5-8,5-8). For the test input, the first non-zero elements are in Row0, columns 1 and 2 (3s) and Row1, columns 1 and 2 (2 and3). Following Example 1's pattern where the blocks are shifted down and right, perhaps the test output's blocks are at (0-3,4-7) and (4-7,4-7), but that's a guess.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the blocks are positioned based on the input's non-zero elements' coordinates. For example, each non-zero element (i,j) contributes a block starting at (i*3, j*3), size 4x4. For test input:\n\n(0,1) is 3 \u2192 block at (0*3=0,1*3=3) \u2192 rows 0-3, columns3-6.\n\n(0,2) is3 \u2192 block at (0,6) \u2192 rows0-3, columns6-9. But 9 columns is beyond the output's size.\n\n(1,1) is2 \u2192 block at (3,3) \u2192 rows3-6, columns3-6.\n\n(1,2) is3 \u2192 block at (3,6) \u2192 rows3-6, columns6-9.\n\nBut the output is 9x9, so columns6-9 would be columns6-8. So these blocks would overlap and create a larger region of 3s.\n\nBut the expected output's structure is unclear. Given the examples, perhaps the test output will have two 4x4 blocks of 3s, positioned similarly to the examples but adjusted based on the input's non-zero elements.\n\nAlternatively, since the test input is the transpose of Example 1's input (swapping rows and columns), maybe the output is also a transpose of Example 1's output. But Example 1's output has blocks at (1-4,1-4) and (5-8,5-8). Transposing would not change their positions.\n\nGiven the time I've spent, I'll proceed with the following hypothesis: each non-zero element in the input results in a 4x4 block of 3s in the output, positioned at (i*4, j*4). However, only the first two non-zero elements are considered. \n\nFor the test input, the first two non-zero elements are at (0,1) and (0,2). So their blocks would start at (0,4) and (0,8). But since the output is 9x9, the second block would be at (0,8), which is column 8, but it's only one column. So this is not possible.\n\nAlternatively, the test input's first two non-zero elements are (0,1) and (1,1). So blocks at (0,4) and (4,4). The output would have two 4x4 blocks at (0,4) and (4,4).\n\nSo the output would look like:\n\nRows 0-3, columns4-7 filled with 3s.\n\nRows4-7, columns4-7 filled with 3s.\n\nThe rest zeros.\n\nBut this is just a guess. Given the examples, I think the pattern is that each non-zero element in the input's diagonal (i,i) contributes a 4x4 block of 3s starting at (i*4, i*4). For the test input, the diagonal elements are (0,0)=0, (1,1)=2, (2,2)=0. So only (1,1) is non-zero. So one block at (4,4). But the examples have two blocks each, so this theory is incorrect.\n\nGiven the time I've invested and the need to provide an answer, I'll conclude that the pattern is as follows: each non-zero element in the input is replaced by a 4x4 block of 3s in the output, positioned at (i*4, j*4). But overlapping blocks are merged. However, since the test input has non-zero elements that would cause overlapping blocks, this may result in larger regions of 3s. However, based on the examples, the output seems to have two 4x4 blocks. \n\nFor the test input, the non-zero elements are (0,1), (0,2), (1,1), (1,2). Assuming only the first two non-zero elements are considered, their blocks would be at (0,4) and (0,8). But since the output is 9 columns, the second block would be at (0,8), which is column 8. But 4x4 blocks starting at column8 would go to column11, which is out of bounds. So this is not possible.\n\nTherefore, I think the correct approach is to look for each input's elements to be transformed into 3x3 blocks in the output, where each block is filled with the input value. But if the input value is non-zero, the corresponding 3x3 block is filled with 3s. For example, any non-zero value (2,3) becomes 3 in the output block. But how this leads to the 4x4 blocks.\n\nAlternatively, each input element is expanded into a 3x3 block where the entire block is filled with the input value if it's non-zero. But then, how to get the larger 4x4 blocks.\n\nPerhaps the input is first upscaled by a factor of 3, then each non-zero element is replaced with a 4x4 block of 3s. But this seems arbitrary.\n\nAfter struggling for a long time, I think the answer for the test input should follow the pattern where the output is a 9x9 matrix with two 4x4 blocks of 3s. Their positions depend on the input's non-zero elements. For the test input, which has non-zero elements in the first row (0,1) and (0,2), and the second row (1,1) and (1,2), the output might have blocks starting at (0,4) and (4,4), but I'm not sure.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and the need to provide an answer, I'll make an educated guess based on the examples. The test input is similar to Example 1, but with non-zero elements in row 0. So the output blocks might start at (0,4) and (4,4), leading to:\n\nRows 0-3, columns4-7 filled with 3s.\n\nRows4-7, columns4-7 filled with 3s.\n\nThe rest zeros.\n\nBut I'm not sure. Alternatively, the output might have blocks at (0,4) and (4,8), but since the output is 9x9, the second block would be at columns8-11, which is out of bounds.\n\nGiven the examples, perhaps the test input's output is similar to Example 1's output but shifted upward. However, without a clear pattern, I'll proceed to write the output based on the examples' structure, applying the same transformation. The test input's first non-zero elements are in row 0, so the blocks would start at (0*4=0, 1*4=4) and (1*4=4, 2*4=8). But the latter is out of bounds. So perhaps the output is:\n\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0]\n\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0]\n\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0]\n\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0]\n\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0]\n\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0]\n\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0]\n\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0]\n\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nBut this doesn't match the examples' structure. Alternatively, considering the test input's first non-zero element is at (0,1) with value 3, perhaps the first block starts at row0, column4, size 4x4. But this would lead to columns4-7 filled with 3s in rows0-3. Then the next non-zero element at (0,2) would start at column8, but there's only one column available. So this is invalid.\n\nGiven the time I'm spending and the need to provide an answer, I'll assume the pattern is that each non-zero element in the input's diagonal (i,i) results in a 4x4 block starting at (i*4, i*4). For the test input, the diagonal elements are (0,0) 0, (1,1) 2, (2,2) 0. So only (1,1) is non-zero, leading to a block at (4,4). But the examples have two blocks. This doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, the blocks are positioned based on the input's first and last non-zero elements. For the test input, first non-zero is (0,1), last is (1,2). So their blocks are at (0,4) and (4,8). But columns8-11 are out of bounds. So this is not possible.\n\nAfter extensive analysis without success, I'll proceed to the answer based on the closest pattern I can infer, which is that the output consists of two 4x4 blocks of 3s positioned diagonally. For the test input, given the non-zero elements in row 0 and row 1, the blocks might be shifted accordingly. Following Example 1's structure, the test input's output might look like:\n\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n[0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n[0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n[0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n[0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3]\n\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3]\n\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3]\n\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3]\n\nBut adjusted for the test input. However, I'm not confident. Given that the test input's non-zero elements are in the first and second rows, perhaps the output's blocks are placed in the upper-middle and lower-middle sections. But without a clear pattern, this is a guess.",

        "cot_2": "Okay, let's tackle this puzzle. So, I have these input and output examples, and I need to figure out the pattern that transforms the input into the output. Then apply that to the test input. Let's start by looking at the training examples.\n\nFirst, let's look at Example 0. The input is a 3x3 matrix:\n\n[3, 3, 0]\n[3, 2, 0]\n[0, 0, 0]\n\nThe output is a 9x9 matrix. Hmm, so the output size is 3 times the input size in both dimensions. Because 3x3 becomes 9x9. So each element in the input is somehow expanded into a 3x3 block in the output. But there's more to it than just scaling up because the values in the output aren't just duplicates. Let me see.\n\nLooking at the output for Example 0. The first four rows are all [3,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,0]. Then the next four rows start with zeros and then have 3s, and then more zeros. The last row is all zeros. Wait, the input has a 3 in the first row first column. The output's first four rows (each 3x3 block) are 3s, except the last part. Let me check the positions.\n\nWait, maybe each element in the input matrix determines a larger block in the output. Let's see: the input is 3x3, output is 9x9. So each input cell becomes a 3x3 block in the output. Let's map the input cells to their corresponding blocks in the output.\n\nFor example, the input cell (0,0) is 3. In the output, the first 3 rows and first 3 columns (since 3x3) are 3s? Wait, but in Example 0's output, the first four rows are 3s followed by 0s. Wait, maybe the block size is 4x4? Because 9 rows divided by 3 would be 3, but 9 isn't a multiple of 3 if each block is 3x3. Wait, 3x3 input, output 9x9. So each input cell corresponds to a 3x3 block. But 3x3 blocks arranged 3x3 would make 9x9. Let me check.\n\nWait, in Example 0's input, the first row is [3,3,0]. So the first row of the output has four rows (maybe each input row becomes 3 rows in output?), but 9 rows total. So 3 rows in input, each becoming 3 rows in output. So 3*3=9. Similarly for columns.\n\nBut in Example 0's output, the first four rows are all [3,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,0]. Wait, four rows? That's confusing. Because 3*3 would be 9, so each input row becomes 3 output rows. But here, the first four rows of the output are similar. Wait, maybe there's a different way. Let's see:\n\nIn Example 0's input:\n\nRow 0: [3,3,0]\nRow 1: [3,2,0]\nRow 2: [0,0,0]\n\nThe output has 9 rows. Let's see how they're divided. The first four rows are all similar. Then rows 4-7 (indices 4,5,6,7) are the next block, and row 8 is all zeros. Hmm. Wait, 4 rows, then another 4 rows, then 1 row. That doesn't split evenly into 3 parts. Maybe my initial assumption is wrong.\n\nAlternative approach: Let's look at the positions in the input matrix and see where their values are placed in the output. For instance, in Example 0, the input has 3 at (0,0). In the output, the top-left 4x4 block is filled with 3s. Wait, the first four rows and first four columns are 3s. Then after that, zeros. Similarly, the middle of the output (rows 4-7, columns 4-7) are 3s. Wait, but the input's center cell (1,1) is 2, but in the output, that area is 3s. Wait, that's conflicting. Because the input's (1,1) is 2, but in the output, the middle 4x4 block is 3s. So maybe the value is not directly copied. Hmm.\n\nWait, looking at Example 1. The input is:\n\n[0,0,0]\n[0,2,3]\n[0,3,3]\n\nThe output has the first row all zeros. Then rows 1-4 are [0,3,3,3,3,0,0,0,0], which is four rows. Then rows 5-8 (four rows) are 0s followed by 3s. So the middle 4 rows (1-4) correspond to the input cell (1,1) which is 2, but the output has 3s there. So maybe the 2 in the input is transformed into 3s in the output? But how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the input's 2 is a special case, and the 3s in the output are determined by the surrounding cells. Let me think again.\n\nAnother angle: in Example 0's input, the cells with 3s are (0,0), (0,1), (1,0). The output seems to have two 4x4 blocks of 3s. The top-left 4x4 block and the middle 4x4 block. Wait, how does that relate to the input?\n\nWait, the input's (0,0) is 3. The output's top-left 4x4 block is 3s. Then the input's (1,1) is 2, which in the output is the middle 4x4 block, which is 3s. Wait, but how? Maybe the 2 is being replaced by 3 in the output? Or maybe the 2 is a clue to some other transformation. Alternatively, perhaps the input's number determines the size of a block in the output.\n\nWait, in Example 0, input (0,0) is 3. The output has a 4x4 block. 3+1=4? Maybe each number in the input corresponds to the size of the block. So 3 becomes 4x4 (since 3+1?), 2 becomes 3x3? But in Example 0's input, (1,1) is 2. In the output, the middle block is 4x4. That doesn't fit. Hmm.\n\nAlternative idea: Each cell in the input is replaced by a 3x3 block in the output. The value of the input cell determines the value in that block. But in the output, the blocks are arranged in a way that they might overlap or be combined. Wait, but in Example 0's output, the first four rows are filled with 3s in the first four columns. That's a 4x4 block, not 3x3. So maybe each input cell is expanded into a 3x3 block, but when placed next to each other, they overlap. For example, if each input cell's block is 3x3, then the total output would be (3 + 2*(n-1)) for each dimension? Wait, the input is 3x3. If each cell is 3x3, then the total size would be 3*3 =9, which matches. So 3x3 input, each cell becomes a 3x3 block in the output. So the output is 9x9.\n\nBut then, how do the values in the input determine the output blocks? Let's see.\n\nIn Example 0, the input's (0,0) is 3. The corresponding output block (rows 0-2, columns 0-2) would be 3s. But looking at the output, the first three rows are all [3,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,0]. Wait, that's four 3s, which would span columns 0-3. So maybe each input cell's block is 4x4? But 3 input cells would make 3*4=12, which is larger than 9. That doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the blocks are 3x3, but they are shifted. Let's think: for input (i,j), the output block starts at (3*i, 3*j) and is 3x3 in size. Let's check.\n\nIn Example 0's output, the first 3 rows and first 3 columns would correspond to input cell (0,0). But in the output, the first three rows are 3s in the first four columns. So that doesn't align. Alternatively, perhaps the blocks are 3x3 but with overlap. Maybe each cell in the input is expanded into a 3x3 block, but adjacent blocks overlap by 1 row or column. So for example, input cell (0,0) is a 3x3 block starting at (0,0), then (0,1) starts at (0,2), overlapping by one column. Let's see:\n\nIf each block is 3x3 and overlaps with adjacent blocks by 1, then the total size would be 3 + (3-1)*(3-1) = 3 + 4 =7? Hmm, not sure. This approach might not be working.\n\nAlternative approach: Look for how the output matrix is structured. In Example 0's output, the first four rows are all 3s in the first four columns. Then rows 4-7 have 3s starting from column 4. The last row is all zeros. So maybe each input cell is represented as a 4x4 block, but arranged in a way that they overlap. For example, input cell (0,0) is a 4x4 block, then (0,1) is another 4x4 starting at column 1, creating overlap. But then, for a 3x3 input, the output would be (4 + 2*(3-1)) = 8 rows and columns, which is less than 9. So that doesn't fit.\n\nWait, the output in Example 0 has 9 rows and 9 columns. So 9x9. Let's think of dividing the output into 3x3 sections, each 3x3. But that would be 3x3 sections arranged as 3x3, but that gives 9x9. So each input cell is mapped to a 3x3 section in the output. Let's check:\n\nIn Example 0's input, cell (0,0) is 3. The output's first 3 rows and first 3 columns should be 3s. But looking at the output, the first three rows have [3,3,3,3,0,...], which is four 3s. So that's more than 3 columns. So that idea might not hold.\n\nAnother thought: The output matrices in both examples have 4x4 blocks of 3s and 0s. Let's count the blocks. In Example 0's output, there are two 4x4 blocks of 3s (top-left and middle), and the rest are 0s. How does that relate to the input?\n\nThe input has 3s in certain positions. Maybe the output is combining adjacent input cells. For example, if two 3s are adjacent in the input, their corresponding blocks in the output merge into a larger block. But in Example 0's input, (0,0) and (0,1) are both 3, so maybe their blocks merge into a 4x4 block. Similarly, (1,0) and (1,1) is 3 and 2. Wait, but (1,1) is 2. How does that affect?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each cell in the input is a \"tile\" that is expanded in the output, with the number in the input indicating how many times the tile is replicated. But I'm not sure.\n\nWait, looking at Example 1's input:\n\nInput is:\n\n[0,0,0]\n\n[0,2,3]\n\n[0,3,3]\n\nThe output has four rows (1-4) with 3s starting from column 1, and four rows (5-8) with 3s starting from column 5. The input's (1,1) is 2, (1,2) and (2,1), (2,2) are 3s. So maybe the 2 in the input is a marker for a vertical split, and the 3s indicate blocks. But how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the numbers in the input represent the number of 4x4 blocks in the output. For example, a 3 in the input leads to four rows and four columns of 3s. But why would 3 lead to 4 rows?\n\nWait, in Example 0's input, the sum of the numbers in the first row is 3+3+0=6. The output has four rows of 3s. Not sure.\n\nAlternative approach: Let's compare the input and output in Example 0. The input is a 3x3 matrix. The output is 9x9. Let's think of each row in the input as being expanded into three rows in the output. Similarly for columns.\n\nFor example, each row in the input is tripled in the output. So each input row becomes three output rows. But in Example 0's output, the first four rows are the same. That's more than three. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe the expansion is such that each input cell is replaced by a 3x3 grid, and then the overlapping cells are combined. For example, each cell in the input is a 3x3 grid in the output, but when adjacent cells are processed, their grids overlap and their values are merged. But how?\n\nAlternatively, think of the output as a larger grid where each input cell corresponds to a 3x3 region. For example, input cell (i,j) corresponds to rows 3i to 3i+2 and columns 3j to 3j+2 in the output. Then, the value of the input cell is placed in that region. Let's check:\n\nIn Example 0, input cell (0,0) is 3. So output rows 0-2, columns 0-2 should be 3s. But looking at the output:\n\nFirst three rows of the output are:\n\n[3,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,0]\n\n[3,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,0]\n\n[3,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nSo columns 0-3 are 3s. That's 4 columns. So that doesn't fit the 3x3 region idea.\n\nHmm, maybe each input cell is expanded into a 4x4 block, but arranged in a way that they overlap by one cell. For example, input cell (0,0) covers rows 0-3, columns 0-3. Then (0,1) covers rows 0-3, columns 2-5. So overlapping. Then for a 3x3 input, the output would be 3*3 +1 =10 rows and columns, but the output is 9x9, so that's not matching.\n\nAlternatively, each input cell is 3x3 in the output, but with a stride of 3. So input cell (0,0) is rows 0-2, columns 0-2. (0,1) is rows 0-2, columns 3-5. But Example 0's input has three columns, so output would be 3*3=9 columns, which fits. But looking at the output, the first row is [3,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,0]. So columns 0-3 are 3s, which would span two input cells (0,0) and (0,1). But input (0,0) and (0,1) are both 3. So their output blocks (each 3x3) would be adjacent. So in columns 0-2 (from (0,0)) and 3-5 (from (0,1)), but the output's first row has 3s up to column 3. That suggests overlap. Wait, but the input cell (0,0) is 3, so output columns 0-2 would be 3s, and (0,1) is 3, so columns 3-5. But the first row in the output has 3s up to column 3. So maybe the blocks are not 3x3 but 4x4, but overlapping. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the pattern is that each cell in the input is replaced by a 3x3 grid in the output, but the value in the cell determines how many layers or repetitions. For example, a 3 in the input causes the corresponding 3x3 block to be filled with 3s, but if adjacent cells are also 3s, they merge into larger blocks. But I'm not sure.\n\nAnother approach: Look for the positions of 3s and 0s in the output and how they relate to the input.\n\nIn Example 0's output, there are two main 4x4 blocks of 3s. The first is in the top-left, covering rows 0-3 and columns 0-3. The second is in the middle, rows 4-7 and columns 4-7. The input cell (0,0) is 3, (0,1) is 3, (1,0) is 3, and (1,1) is 2. The other cells are 0.\n\nThe output's first block (top-left) is 4x4. Maybe that's combining the input's (0,0), (0,1), (1,0), and (1,1) cells. But the (1,1) cell is 2. But in the output, that block is 3s. So perhaps the 2 is being replaced by 3 in the output.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the input's 2 is a special marker that indicates a different block arrangement. Looking at Example 1's input, the (1,1) cell is 2. In the output, there's a 4x4 block of 3s starting at row 1, column 1, and another 4x4 block starting at row 5, column 5. So the input's 2 might be a separator or a trigger for splitting the blocks.\n\nWait, in Example 0's input, the 2 is at (1,1). The output has two 4x4 blocks. In Example 1's input, the 2 is also at (1,1), and the output has two 4x4 blocks. So maybe the 2 in the input's center is a divider. So the output is divided into four quadrants. The 2 splits the output into four parts. Then, the numbers around the 2 determine which quadrants are filled with 3s.\n\nWait, in Example 0's input, the cells around the center (2) are (0,0)=3, (0,1)=3, (1,0)=3, (1,2)=0, (2,0)=0, etc. The output has two 4x4 blocks: top-left and middle. So maybe the 2 splits the output into four quadrants, and the non-zero values in the input's corresponding quadrants determine which parts are filled.\n\nFor example, the input's center cell is 2. The four quadrants in the output are top-left, top-right, bottom-left, bottom-right. The 2 in the center acts as a divider. The input's cells in each quadrant determine whether that quadrant is filled with 3s in the output. Wait, but Example 0's input has (0,0) and (0,1) as 3s, which would be top-left and top-middle. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the 2 in the input's center indicates that the output is split into two parts vertically and horizontally, creating four regions. Then, the sum or count of 3s in each region of the input determines if that region is filled with 3s in the output.\n\nBut in Example 0's input, the top-left quadrant (excluding center) has three 3s. So maybe the output's corresponding quadrant is filled. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the presence of 3s in the input's quadrants determines which regions are filled in the output. For example:\n\n- The input's top-left cells (0,0), (0,1), (1,0) are 3s. The output's top-left quadrant is filled with 3s.\n\n- The input's bottom-right cells (2,2) is 0, but maybe (1,1) is 2, which triggers another region. \n\nAlternatively, the output is divided into four 4x4 blocks (but 9x9 isn't divisible by 4). This line of thought isn't leading me anywhere.\n\nLet me try another angle. Let's look at the output structure in Example 0:\n\nThe output has 9 rows and columns. The top-left 4x4 block is 3s. Then there's a 4x4 block starting at row 4, column 4. The rest are zeros. The last row and column are zeros. So each 4x4 block is separated by a row and column of zeros.\n\nSo the 4x4 blocks are placed at positions (0,0) and (4,4). The distance between them is 4 (since 4 rows and columns apart). So perhaps each 4x4 block is generated by a 3 in the input, but how?\n\nLooking at Example 0's input, the 3s are in positions (0,0), (0,1), (1,0). The 2 is at (1,1). The output has two 4x4 blocks. So maybe each group of 3s in the input creates a 4x4 block in the output. But how?\n\nAlternatively, the number of 3s in the input corresponds to the number of 4x4 blocks in the output. Example 0's input has three 3s but the output has two blocks. Example 1's input has two 3s (assuming 2 is not counted) and the output has two blocks. Not sure.\n\nWait, Example 1's input has three 3s: (1,2), (2,1), (2,2). The output has two 4x4 blocks. So this doesn't align.\n\nAnother idea: The 2 in the input's center (1,1) is a marker that splits the output into four quadrants. Each quadrant is filled with 3s based on the input's corresponding quadrants.\n\nIn Example 0's input, the top-left quadrant (rows 0-1, columns 0-1) has three 3s. So in the output's top-left quadrant (rows 0-4, columns 0-4?), it's filled with 3s. But I'm not sure how the quadrants are defined.\n\nAlternatively, the input's 2 at (1,1) acts as a cross, splitting the input into four quadrants. Each quadrant in the input determines a block in the output. For example:\n\n- Top-left quadrant: input cells (0,0), (0,1), (1,0). If these have values, the output's top-left block is filled with 3s.\n\n- Bottom-right quadrant: input cell (2,2) is 0, so the output's bottom-right block remains 0.\n\nBut in Example 0, the input's (1,1) is 2, and the output has a middle block filled with 3s. Maybe the 2 is ignored, and the other 3s in the input determine the blocks.\n\nAlternatively, the 2 is replaced with the sum of adjacent cells or something.\n\nThis is getting a bit stuck. Let's look for another pattern.\n\nLooking at the output matrices:\n\nIn Example 0's output, the two 4x4 blocks of 3s are placed at the top-left and middle, separated by a row of zeros. Each block is 4x4, and the spacing between them is one row and column.\n\nSo maybe each block is a 4x4 area, and they are positioned at intervals of 4. The first block starts at (0,0), the next at (4,4), but since the output is 9x9, the next block would start at (4,4) and occupy rows 4-7 and columns 4-7. The last row and column are 0s.\n\nSo in Example 0's input, the 3s in the top-left part of the input generate the top-left block, and the 3s in the bottom-right part (but the input's bottom-right is 0, so maybe the 2 in the center contributes to the middle block. But how?\n\nAlternatively, the 2 in the input is a special value that indicates a block in the middle of the output. So if the center cell is 2, then a 4x4 block is placed in the middle of the output. And other 3s in the input generate blocks in their respective positions.\n\nWait, in Example 0, the center cell is 2, and there's a middle block. But the input's (1,1) is 2, and the output's middle block is 3s. So maybe the 2 in the input is replaced by 3 in the output's middle block. Then, the other 3s in the input generate the top-left block.\n\nBut in Example 1, the center cell is 2, and there are two blocks in the output: one starting at row 1, column 1, and another at row 5, column 5. So maybe the 2 in the input indicates that the output is divided into two parts: upper and lower. Each part's block depends on the input's corresponding rows.\n\nIn Example 1's input, the second row (row 1) has [0,2,3], and third row has [0,3,3]. So maybe the 3s in row 1 and row 2 of the input generate the two blocks in the output.\n\nAlternatively, the output blocks are determined by the rows of the input. For Example 0:\n\nInput rows:\n\nRow 0: [3,3,0]\n\nRow 1: [3,2,0]\n\nRow 2: [0,0,0]\n\nOutput has two blocks. The first block corresponds to row 0 and 1 of the input, and the second to row 1 and 2. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, each row in the input generates a block in the output. For example, the first input row generates the top-left block, the second row generates the middle block, and the third row generates the bottom-right block. But in Example 0, the third input row is all zeros, so the bottom-right block is zeros. The first input row has 3s, so the top-left block is 3s. The second input row has a 3 and 2, which may generate the middle block.\n\nBut in Example 0's output, the middle block is 3s. The input's second row has 3, 2, 0. The 2 is in the center. So perhaps the 2 in the input's second row (middle) causes the middle block to be filled with 3s. But why?\n\nAlternatively, the number in the input's cell determines the value of the output block. So if the cell is 3, the corresponding block is 3s. If it's 2, perhaps the block is split into parts. But in Example 0's output, the middle block is 3s despite the input cell being 2. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAnother observation: In both training examples, the output's 4x4 blocks are filled with 3s. The input's 2s are replaced with 3s in the output. So perhaps the transformation replaces any non-zero input with 3 in the output blocks.\n\nSo the pattern could be: For each cell in the input, if the value is non-zero, create a 4x4 block of 3s in the output at a position determined by the cell's location. The 0s in the input remain 0 in the output.\n\nBut how are the positions determined? Let's check Example 0:\n\nInput cell (0,0) is 3. The output's top-left 4x4 block is 3s. So perhaps each non-zero cell creates a 4x4 block shifted by (i*4, j*4) in the output. But for a 3x3 input, this would require 12x12 output, which isn't the case. So that's not it.\n\nAlternatively, the blocks are positioned such that each non-zero cell in the input creates a 4x4 block starting at row i*4, column j*4. But for Example 0's input cell (0,0), i=0, j=0. So block starts at (0,0), which fits. Input cell (0,1) would start at (0,4), but in Example 0's output, the first four columns of the first four rows are 3s. So cell (0,0) and (0,1) are next to each other, but their blocks are adjacent. That would require the blocks to be placed next to each other without overlapping. So (0,0) block is 0-3 rows and columns, (0,1) block would be 0-3 rows and 4-7 columns, etc. But in Example 0's output, the first four rows have 3s up to column 3. Then columns 4-7 are 0s in those rows. So that doesn't fit. So maybe each input cell's block is placed in a staggered manner.\n\nAnother possibility: The output is divided into a 3x3 grid of 3x3 blocks, but each input cell is expanded into a 3x3 block. But then, the output would be 9x9. For example, input cell (i,j) becomes a 3x3 block at (i*3, j*3) in the output. But in Example 0's input cell (0,0) is 3. So output's block at (0-2, 0-2) would be 3s. But in the output, those positions are part of the larger 4x4 block. So this doesn't align.\n\nAlternative Idea: Let's look at the number of 3s in each output row. In Example 0's output, the first four rows have four 3s followed by five 0s. Then the next four rows have four 3s starting at column 4, etc. It seems like the output is made up of two 4x4 blocks of 3s shifted by four columns and rows. The position of these blocks corresponds to the positions of the non-zero elements in the input.\n\nBut how? The input has non-zero elements in (0,0), (0,1), (1,0), (1,1)=2. Maybe the two 4x4 blocks correspond to the upper-left part of the input and the lower-right part. But the input's lower-right part is all zeros.\n\nWait, the output's middle block in Example 0 is at rows 4-7 and columns 4-7. The input's (1,1) is 2, which is the center. Maybe the 2 causes the middle block to be filled with 3s. So regardless of the input's value at (1,1), as long as it's non-zero, the middle block is filled. But in Example 1, the input's (1,1) is 2, and the middle of the output is filled with 3s. But in Example 0's input, the (1,1) is 2, and the middle block is 3s. So maybe the 2 is treated as a non-zero value, and the middle block is filled with 3s.\n\nThen, the other non-zero values in the input determine other blocks. For example, the top-left block is filled if there are non-zero values in the input's top-left quadrant.\n\nSo the pattern could be:\n\n- The output has a 4x4 block of 3s centered at the position corresponding to each non-zero cell in the input.\n\n- The 2 in the center of the input generates a 4x4 block in the middle of the output.\n\n- The other non-zero cells (3s) generate their own 4x4 blocks.\n\nBut in Example 0's input, there are three 3s and a 2. The output has two 4x4 blocks. So that doesn't fit. Unless the 3s in adjacent cells merge their blocks into a larger one.\n\nAlternatively, each non-zero cell in the input creates a 4x4 block in the output, positioned such that the cell's row and column determine the starting position. For example:\n\n- For input cell (i,j), the block starts at row (i*4) and column (j*4). But in Example 0, (0,0) would start at (0,0), (0,1) at (0,4), etc. But the output is 9x9, so (0,4) would be column 4, but in Example 0's output, the first four rows have 3s up to column 3. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAnother Idea: The output's blocks are formed by combining adjacent non-zero cells in the input. For instance, contiguous non-zero cells in the input form a larger block in the output. In Example 0, the 3s in (0,0), (0,1), and (1,0) form an L-shape. The output's top-left block is 4x4, which could be the result of combining these three cells. Similarly, the 2 in the center might combine with other cells. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the output is generated by tiling the input values in a larger grid, but with each value repeated multiple times. For example, each input value is replicated 3 times in each dimension. But in Example 0's input, the first row is [3,3,0], which would become [3,3,3, 3,3,3, 0,0,0] for each row. But in the output, the first four rows are [3,3,3,3,0,...], which doesn't match.\n\nWait, perhaps the input is scaled up by a factor of 3, but with each element becoming a 3x3 block. For example:\n\nInput element (i,j) becomes a 3x3 block in the output at (3i,3j). The value of the block depends on the input value. But in Example 0, the input's (0,0) is 3. So output block (0-2, 0-2) would be 3s. Then (0,1) is 3, so output block (0-2, 3-5) would be 3s. (1,0) is 3, so block (3-5, 0-2) is 3s. (1,1) is 2, so block (3-5, 3-5) is 2s? But in the output, those blocks are all 3s. So maybe the 2 is treated as 3.\n\nAlternatively, any non-zero input value becomes 3 in the output. So 2s are replaced with 3s. Then, the input's non-zero cells are expanded into 3x3 blocks of 3s.\n\nBut how does that create the output structure in the examples?\n\nIn Example 0, the input has 3s at (0,0), (0,1), (1,0), and 2 at (1,1). If we replace 2 with 3, then all non-zero cells are 3. Expanding each into a 3x3 block would give:\n\n(0,0) block: rows 0-2, columns 0-2: 3s.\n\n(0,1) block: rows 0-2, columns 3-5: 3s.\n\n(1,0) block: rows 3-5, columns 0-2: 3s.\n\n(1,1) block: rows 3-5, columns 3-5: 3s.\n\nThe other input cells are 0, so their blocks are 0s.\n\nBut the output in Example 0 has the first four rows all 3s in columns 0-3. So the overlapping of blocks might explain this. For example, (0,0) and (0,1) blocks are adjacent, creating a wider block. Similarly, (1,0) and (1,1) blocks create a larger block. So the combined effect is that the top-left 6x6 area (composed of four 3x3 blocks) becomes 3s, but in the output, it's divided into two 4x4 blocks. So this still doesn't fit.\n\nMaybe there's a different scaling factor. For example, each input cell is scaled to a 4x4 block, but arranged with overlap. So 3x3 input would become 3*4 - 3 =9 rows and columns. Wait, 3 cells *4 rows each minus 3 overlaps. So 3*4=12, minus 3 (since overlaps between each cell) gives 9. That works.\n\nSo each input cell corresponds to a 4x4 block in the output, but overlapping with the neighboring cells by 3 rows and columns. Wait, this is getting complicated.\n\nAlternatively, the output is constructed by placing each input cell's value into a 4x4 block, but shifted by 4 rows and columns. For example, input cell (i,j) is placed at (i*4, j*4) in the output. But for 3x3 input, this would require 12x12 output, which is not the case. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAnother Idea: Let's look for the pattern in the output's row structure. In Example 0's output, the first four rows are identical, then the next four, then one. So 4+4+1=9. Similarly for columns.\n\nThis suggests that the output is divided into three sections vertically: four rows, four rows, one row. Similarly horizontally. Maybe each input row corresponds to four output rows, but that doesn't split evenly.\n\nAlternatively, each input row corresponds to three output rows, but the middle row is duplicated. Not sure.\n\nWait, let's look at Example 1's output. The first row is all zeros. Then rows 1-4 are the same, rows 5-8 are the same. So again, 1+4+4=9. This suggests that the output is divided into three parts, perhaps corresponding to the three rows of the input. The first input row (all zeros) becomes the first row of the output. The second input row becomes four rows, and the third input row becomes four rows. But how?\n\nIn Example 0's input, the first two rows have non-zero elements, and their output has eight rows (4+4), then the last row is all zeros. So maybe:\n\n- Each input row is expanded into four output rows if it has non-zero elements, or a single row if all zeros.\n\nBut Example 0's input has three rows. The first two rows are non-zero, so expanded into four rows each. But 4+4=8, plus the third row (all zeros) as one row, totaling 9. This fits. Let's check.\n\nExample 0's input:\n\nRow 0: [3,3,0] \u2192 non-zero \u2192 expanded to 4 rows.\n\nRow 1: [3,2,0] \u2192 non-zero \u2192 expanded to 4 rows.\n\nRow 2: [0,0,0] \u2192 all zeros \u2192 1 row.\n\nTotal rows: 4+4+1=9. Which matches the output.\n\nSimilarly, Example 1's input:\n\nRow 0: [0,0,0] \u2192 1 row.\n\nRow 1: [0,2,3] \u2192 non-zero \u2192 4 rows.\n\nRow 2: [0,3,3] \u2192 non-zero \u21924 rows.\n\nTotal: 1+4+4=9. Yes.\n\nSo this seems to be the case. So the rule is: each input row is expanded into four rows if it contains any non-zero elements, otherwise into one row. Then, for the columns, each input column is expanded into four columns if any element in that column is non-zero, otherwise into one column. Wait, but how are the columns handled?\n\nWait, in Example 0's input, the first two columns have non-zero elements. So maybe each column is expanded into four columns if there's a non-zero in that column. Let's check:\n\nExample 0's input columns:\n\nColumn 0: [3,3,0] \u2192 non-zero \u2192 expanded to 4 columns.\n\nColumn 1: [3,2,0] \u2192 non-zero \u21924 columns.\n\nColumn 2: [0,0,0] \u2192 zero \u21921 column.\n\nSo total columns:4+4+1=9. Which matches.\n\nSo the pattern is:\n\nEach row in the input is transformed into 4 rows if it contains any non-zero elements, otherwise 1 row.\n\nEach column in the input is transformed into 4 columns if any element in that column is non-zero, otherwise 1 column.\n\nThe values in the output are 3 if the corresponding input cell (after expansion) was non-zero, otherwise 0.\n\nBut wait, in Example 0's input, the (1,1) cell is 2. But in the output, the expanded block is 3s. So any non-zero input value is converted to 3 in the output.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. For each row in the input:\n\n   a. If the row contains any non-zero elements, expand it into 4 rows.\n\n   b. If the row is all zeros, expand into 1 row.\n\n2. For each column in the input:\n\n   a. If the column contains any non-zero elements, expand it into 4 columns.\n\n   b. If the column is all zeros, expand into 1 column.\n\n3. In the output matrix, each cell is 3 if the corresponding input cell (from the original position before expansion) was non-zero; otherwise, it's 0.\n\nLet's verify this with Example 0.\n\nInput:\n\nRow 0: [3,3,0] \u2192 non-zero \u2192 4 rows.\n\nRow 1: [3,2,0] \u2192 non-zero \u21924 rows.\n\nRow 2: [0,0,0] \u2192 1 row.\n\nColumns:\n\nColumn 0: [3,3,0] \u2192 non-zero \u21924 columns.\n\nColumn 1: [3,2,0] \u2192 non-zero \u21924 columns.\n\nColumn 2: [0,0,0] \u21921 column.\n\nSo the output has 4+4+1=9 rows and 4+4+1=9 columns.\n\nEach cell in the output corresponds to a cell in the input, expanded into 4x4 if the original row and column were non-zero. For example, the intersection of expanded row (from input row 0) and expanded column (input column 0) is a 4x4 block of 3s because the input's (0,0) is 3.\n\nSimilarly, the intersection of expanded row from input row 0 and expanded column from input column 1 is a 4x4 block of 3s.\n\nThe intersection of expanded row from input row 0 and expanded column from input column 2 is a 4x1 block (since column 2 is expanded into 1 column) of 0s.\n\nSimilarly, the expanded rows from input row 1 and columns from input column 0 and 1 are 4x4 blocks of 3s (since input cells (1,0) and (1,1) are non-zero).\n\nThe expanded row from input row 2 (1 row) and any column will be 0s, as per the input.\n\nSo the output structure would be:\n\nRows 0-3: expanded from input rows 0 and 1.\n\nColumns 0-3: expanded from input columns 0 and 1.\n\nThe intersection of these is 4x4 blocks of 3s. But wait, input rows 0 and 1 are both non-zero, so each is expanded into 4 rows, leading to 8 rows. But in Example 0's output, the first four rows are filled with 3s, then the next four rows also have 3s in certain columns.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let's re-examine the expansion.\n\nIf each row is expanded into 4 rows if non-zero, then input row 0 becomes 4 rows, row 1 becomes 4 rows, row 2 becomes 1 row. So the output rows are:\n\nInput row 0 \u2192 output rows 0-3.\n\nInput row 1 \u2192 output rows 4-7.\n\nInput row 2 \u2192 output row 8.\n\nSimilarly, columns:\n\nInput column 0 \u2192 output columns 0-3.\n\nInput column 1 \u2192 output columns 4-7.\n\nInput column 2 \u2192 output column 8.\n\nSo each output cell (i,j) is determined by the input row and column that expanded to it.\n\nFor example, output rows 0-3 and columns 0-3 correspond to input cell (0,0), which is 3. So this 4x4 block is filled with 3s.\n\nOutput rows 0-3 and columns 4-7 correspond to input cell (0,1), which is 3 \u2192 filled with 3s.\n\nOutput rows 0-3 and column 8 correspond to input cell (0,2), which is 0 \u2192 filled with 0s.\n\nSimilarly, output rows 4-7 and columns 0-3 correspond to input cell (1,0) \u2192 3 \u2192 filled with 3s.\n\nOutput rows 4-7 and columns 4-7 correspond to input cell (1,1) \u2192 2 (non-zero) \u2192 filled with 3s.\n\nOutput rows 4-7 and column 8 \u2192 input (1,2) \u21920 \u21920.\n\nOutput row 8 and any column \u21920.\n\nSo the output would look like:\n\nRows 0-3:\n\n- Columns 0-3: 3s.\n\n- Columns 4-7: 3s.\n\n- Column 8: 0s.\n\nSo each row 0-3 would be [3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,0]. But wait, in Example 0's output, the first four rows are [3,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,0]. That doesn't match. So this approach is incorrect.\n\nHmm, this suggests that my current understanding is wrong. Let me re-express Example 0's output:\n\nThe first four rows are:\n\n[3,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nThis suggests that columns 0-3 are 3s, and columns 4-8 are 0s. But according to the previous expansion logic, columns 4-7 should be 3s (from input cell (0,1)).\n\nSo there's a discrepancy. This implies that the expansion is not based on individual input cells, but perhaps on the rows and columns as a whole.\n\nAlternative Idea: If a row in the input has any non-zero elements, the entire row in the output is filled with 3s in the expanded columns. Similarly for columns.\n\nFor example:\n\nIn Example 0's input, row 0 has non-zero elements. So the expanded rows for row 0 (4 rows) will have 3s in all columns that were expanded from non-zero columns.\n\nColumns 0 and 1 are non-zero \u2192 expanded into 4 columns each. So in the output rows 0-3, columns 0-7 (4+4=8 columns) are filled with 3s. Column 8 (expanded from input column 2) is 0. So each of these rows is [3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,0]. But in Example 0's output, the first four rows are [3,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,0]. This doesn't match.\n\nWait, but in Example 0's output, the first four rows have 3s only in the first four columns, then zeros. This suggests that the columns expansion is not based on the entire column's presence of non-zero, but perhaps per cell.\n\nAnother Idea: Each input cell is expanded into a 4x4 block if it's non-zero, otherwise into 1x1. But this would lead to overlapping blocks. For example, input cell (0,0) is 3 \u2192 4x4 block. Then cell (0,1) is 3 \u2192 another 4x4 block starting at column 4. So the output's first four rows would have 3s from columns 0-3 and 4-7. But in Example 0's output, the first four rows have 3s only in columns 0-3 and then 0s. So this isn't the case.\n\nAlternatively, if non-zero cells are expanded into 4x4 blocks, but adjacent blocks merge. For example, in Example 0's input, the 3s in (0,0), (0,1), and (1,0) are adjacent, so their blocks merge into a larger block. But the output's first four rows have a single 4x4 block, which suggests that only certain expansions are happening.\n\nWait, perhaps the expansion is that each non-zero cell in the input generates a 4x4 block in the output, but positioned such that overlapping is avoided. For example, each non-zero cell's block starts at (i*4, j*4). But with a 3x3 input, this would require 12x12 output, which isn't the case. So no.\n\nI'm struggling to find the pattern. Let's try to think of the examples again.\n\nExample 0's input has 3s in the top-left area and a 2 in the center. The output has two 4x4 blocks: top-left and middle. The middle block is centered at row 4-7 and column 4-7.\n\nExample 1's input has 3s in the middle and bottom rows. The output has two 4x4 blocks: one starting at row 1, column 1, and another starting at row 5, column 5.\n\nThe common element is that each 4x4 block in the output is separated by a row or column of zeros. The first block in Example 0 starts at (0,0), the next at (4,4). In Example 1, they start at (1,1) and (5,5). So the separation is 4 rows and columns between blocks.\n\nThis suggests that the blocks are placed at positions that are multiples of 4, but shifted based on some input condition.\n\nIn Example 0, the first block is at (0,0) and the second at (4,4). These correspond to the input's non-zero cells (0,0) and (1,1). Maybe each non-zero cell's position (i,j) determines the block's starting row and column as (i*4, j*4). But for input cell (0,0), that would be (0,0). For (1,1), (4,4). For (0,1), (0,4). But in Example 0's output, there is no block starting at (0,4). So this doesn't fit.\n\nBut in Example 0's output, the first block is 4x4 at (0,0), which could correspond to input cell (0,0). The second block is at (4,4), corresponding to input cell (1,1). So even though (0,1) and (1,0) are non-zero, their corresponding blocks are not present in the output. So this suggests that only certain cells generate blocks.\n\nPerhaps only the input's cells that are 3 generate blocks, and 2s are ignored. But in Example 0's input, (1,1) is 2, but the output has a block there. So that's not it.\n\nAlternatively, the 2 in the input is a special marker that generates a block in the middle. So regardless of other cells, the 2 generates a block. And the other non-zero cells generate their own blocks. But in Example 0's output, there are two blocks. So input cells (0,0), (0,1), (1,0) are 3s, but the output only has two blocks. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAnother Idea: The output's blocks are placed at the positions corresponding to the input's non-zero cells, but each block is offset by the cell's value. For example, a cell with value 3 generates a block offset by 3. But I don't see how.\n\nAlternatively, the value in the input cell determines the size of the block. For example, 3 \u2192 4x4 block, 2 \u2192 3x3 block. But in Example 0's output, the middle block is 4x4, which would correspond to a 3, but the input cell is 2. So no.\n\nThis is really challenging. Let's try to see the test input and see if we can find a pattern from the examples that would apply to it.\n\nTest Input:\n\n[0,3,3]\n\n[0,2,3]\n\n[0,0,0]\n\nThe input is 3x3. The center cell (1,1) is 2. The other non-zero cells are (0,1), (0,2), (1,2). All are 3s.\n\nFollowing the pattern of the training examples, especially Example 1:\n\nIn Example 1, the input had a 2 at (1,1), and the output had two 4x4 blocks. The test input also has a 2 at (1,1). So perhaps the output will have two 4x4 blocks.\n\nIn Example 1, the blocks were placed at rows 1-4 and 5-8. For the test input, maybe one block starts at row 0, column 4 (corresponding to (0,1) and (0,2)), and another block starts at row 4, column 4 (corresponding to (1,1) and (1,2)).\n\nAlternatively, looking at Example 1's input, the non-zero cells were in (1,2), (2,1), (2,2). The output had a block starting at row 1, column 1 and another starting at row 5, column 5. So the positions seem to be related to the input's non-zero cells.\n\nFor the test input, the non-zero cells are (0,1), (0,2), (1,2), and the center (1,1) is 2. So perhaps the output will have two 4x4 blocks: one covering columns 4-7 (for input columns 1 and 2) in the first four rows, and another in columns 4-7 and rows 4-7 (for the center and input cell (1,2)).\n\nBut this is just a guess based on the previous examples.\n\nAlternatively, the test input's output would have two 4x4 blocks:\n\n1. A block starting at row 0, column 4 (for input cells (0,1) and (0,2)), which are both 3s. This would create a 4x4 block spanning columns 4-7 in rows 0-3.\n\n2. A block starting at row 4, column 4 (for input cell (1,2) and the center 2). This would create a 4x4 block spanning rows 4-7 and columns 4-7.\n\nThe rest of the output would be zeros.\n\nThe final row would be all zeros since the third input row is all zeros.\n\nSo the output would look like:\n\nFirst four rows: [0,0,0,0,3,3,3,3,0] repeated four times.\n\nRows 4-7: [0,0,0,0,3,3,3,3,0] repeated four times.\n\nRow 8: all zeros.\n\nBut looking at Example 1's output, the first block starts at row 1. So perhaps the position depends on the input rows. For the test input, the non-zero cells are in row 0 and row 1. So row 0's non-zero cells would generate a block in rows 0-3, row 1's non-zero cells in rows 4-7, and row 2's zeros in row 8.\n\nFor columns, the non-zero cells are in columns 1 and 2. So columns 4-7 and 8 (since column 2 is non-zero, but wait, in the previous examples, non-zero columns are expanded into four columns. For example, in Example 0's input column 2 is zero, so expanded into 1 column. In Example 1's input, column 2 is non-zero (3 in row 1 and 3 in row 2), so expanded into four columns.\n\nSo for the test input:\n\nColumns:\n\nColumn 0: all zeros \u2192 expanded into 1 column.\n\nColumns 1 and 2: non-zero \u2192 each expanded into 4 columns. So columns 1 \u2192 4 columns starting at 1, and column 2 \u2192 4 columns starting at 5? Or perhaps column 1 becomes columns 1-4, column 2 becomes columns 5-8.\n\nBut in Example 0, columns 0 and 1 are non-zero, each expanded into 4 columns, leading to 8 columns, plus column 2 as 1, total 9. So for the test input, columns 1 and 2 are non-zero \u2192 expanded into 4+4=8 columns, plus column 0 as 1 column, totaling 9.\n\nSo the expanded columns would be:\n\n0: 0 \u2192 1 column.\n\n1: non-zero \u2192 4 columns (1-4).\n\n2: non-zero \u2192 4 columns (5-8).\n\nSo, in the test input's output, the blocks would be:\n\nFor input cell (0,1) (3) \u2192 expanded into rows 0-3 and columns 1-4.\n\nFor input cell (0,2) (3) \u2192 rows 0-3 and columns 5-8.\n\nFor input cell (1,1) (2) \u2192 rows 4-7 and columns 1-4.\n\nFor input cell (1,2) (3) \u2192 rows 4-7 and columns 5-8.\n\nBut since the input cell (1,1) is 2, which is non-zero, it would generate a block of 3s in rows 4-7, columns 1-4.\n\nBut according to the previous examples, the 2 in the input center would generate a block in the middle. For example, in Example 0, the 2 in (1,1) caused a block at rows 4-7 and columns 4-7. So maybe the test input's 2 generates a block at rows 4-7 and columns 4-7, and the 3s generate blocks elsewhere.\n\nBut this is getting complicated. Let's try to construct the output for the test input step by step.\n\nTest Input:\n\nRow 0: [0,3,3] \u2192 non-zero \u2192 expanded into 4 rows (0-3).\n\nRow 1: [0,2,3] \u2192 non-zero \u2192 expanded into 4 rows (4-7).\n\nRow 2: [0,0,0] \u2192 1 row (8).\n\nColumns:\n\nColumn 0: [0,0,0] \u2192 1 column (0).\n\nColumn 1: [3,2,0] \u2192 non-zero \u21924 columns (1-4).\n\nColumn 2: [3,3,0] \u2192 non-zero \u21924 columns (5-8).\n\nSo the output is 9x9. Now, each cell in the output is determined by the original input cell's row and column.\n\nFor example:\n\n- Output rows 0-3 (from input row 0) and columns 1-4 (from input column 1) \u2192 input cell (0,1) is 3 \u2192 filled with 3s.\n\n- Output rows 0-3 and columns 5-8 \u2192 input cell (0,2) is 3 \u2192 filled with 3s.\n\n- Output rows 4-7 and columns 1-4 \u2192 input cell (1,1) is 2 (non-zero) \u2192 filled with 3s.\n\n- Output rows 4-7 and columns 5-8 \u2192 input cell (1,2) is 3 \u2192 filled with 3s.\n\n- Output rows 8 and any column \u2192 0s.\n\n- Output columns 0 \u2192 0s.\n\nSo the output would look like:\n\nRows 0-3:\n\n- Columns 1-4: 3s.\n\n- Columns 5-8: 3s.\n\nSo each row in 0-3 would be [0,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3].\n\nBut according to Example 1's output, when there are multiple blocks in the same row, they are adjacent. For example, in Example 1's output, the first four rows after row 0 are filled with 3s starting at column 1.\n\nWait, but in the test input case, the first four rows would have two blocks: columns 1-4 and 5-8. So the first four rows would have 0 in column 0, 3s in columns 1-8. But according to the previous examples, when there are multiple non-zero columns, their expansions are adjacent. So in Example 0's output, the first four rows have 3s in columns 0-3 and 4-7, but in reality, they have 3s up to column 3 and then zeros. So maybe my current approach is incorrect.\n\nThis suggests that my previous reasoning is wrong. Perhaps the expansion is not per cell but per row and column, and any non-zero in the row or column causes the entire expanded row or column to be filled with 3s.\n\nFor example:\n\n- If a row in the input has any non-zero elements, the entire expanded row in the output is filled with 3s in the columns that correspond to non-zero columns.\n\nSo for the test input:\n\nRows 0 and 1 are non-zero \u2192 expanded into 4 rows each.\n\nColumns 1 and 2 are non-zero \u2192 expanded into 4 columns each.\n\nSo, for the output rows 0-3 and 4-7:\n\nEach of these rows will have 3s in columns 1-8 (since columns 1 and 2 are non-zero and expanded into 4+4=8 columns). But column 0 is all zeros \u2192 1 column.\n\nSo each of these rows would be [0,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3].\n\nRow 8 is all zeros.\n\nBut this doesn't match the training examples. For instance, in Example 0's output, the first four rows have 3s in columns 0-3 and 0s elsewhere, which would imply that columns 0 and 1 are non-zero (each expanded into 4 columns) but they are adjacent. So why in Example 0's output, the first four rows have 3s up to column 3 and then zeros?\n\nAh, perhaps when a column is expanded, it's filled with 3s only if the corresponding input cell is non-zero. So for example, in input row 0, column 1 is non-zero, so in the expanded columns for column 1, the output cells are 3s. But column 2 is 0, so expanded into 1 column of 0.\n\nBut this seems to contradict the previous expansion idea.\n\nI think I'm missing the key insight here. Let me try to look at the examples again.\n\nExample 0's input:\n\nRows:\n\n0: [3,3,0] \u2192 non-zero \u2192 expanded into 4 rows.\n\n1: [3,2,0] \u2192 non-zero \u21924 rows.\n\n2: [0,0,0] \u21921 row.\n\nColumns:\n\n0: [3,3,0] \u2192 non-zero \u21924 columns.\n\n1: [3,2,0] \u2192 non-zero \u21924 columns.\n\n2: [0,0,0] \u21921 column.\n\nSo the output rows are 4+4+1=9, columns 4+4+1=9.\n\nNow, each cell in the output is 3 if the corresponding input cell (from the original row and column) is non-zero.\n\nFor example:\n\n- The expanded rows 0-3 come from input row 0.\n\n- The expanded columns 0-3 come from input column 0.\n\n- So the intersection (rows 0-3, columns 0-3) is filled with 3s because input cell (0,0) is 3.\n\n- The expanded columns 4-7 come from input column 1.\n\n- So the intersection (rows 0-3, columns 4-7) is filled with 3s because input cell (0,1) is 3.\n\n- The expanded column 8 comes from input column 2 \u2192 0.\n\nSo each of the first four rows in the output would be 3s in columns 0-7 and 0 in column 8. But in Example 0's output, the first four rows are [3,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,0]. This contradicts that. So this approach must be wrong.\n\nWait, this suggests that my previous assumption is incorrect. Perhaps the expansion isn't based on the entire row and column, but each cell's value determines if the corresponding expanded block is filled with 3s.\n\nSo, each input cell (i,j) becomes a block in the output. The block's position is determined by i and j, and its size is 4x4 if the input cell is non-zero, or 1x1 if zero.\n\nBut for a 3x3 input, each cell's block is 4x4, leading to 12x12 output, which is not the case. So this isn't possible.\n\nAnother Idea: The output's blocks are generated by a convolution-like process. Each non-zero input cell acts as a kernel that generates a 4x4 block of 3s in the output, centered at position (2i, 2j) or similar. For example, input cell (0,0) generates a 4x4 block starting at (0,0), cell (1,1) generates a block starting at (4,4), etc. This would explain the two blocks in Example 0, which are at (0,0) and (4,4). For the test input, the non-zero cells are (0,1), (0,2), (1,1), (1,2), which would generate blocks at (0,4), (0,8), (4,4), (4,8). But the output is 9x9, so positions like 8 would be out of range. So this doesn't fit.\n\nI'm really stuck here. Let's try to think differently. Maybe the pattern is that each input cell's value is replaced with a 3, then the entire matrix is scaled up by a factor of 3, with each cell becoming a 3x3 block. But the output is 9x9, which matches. However, in Example 0's output, the first four rows are all 3s in the first four columns, which suggests that the scaling isn't uniform.\n\nWait, if each input cell is scaled into a 3x3 block of the same value (replacing 2 with 3), then:\n\nExample 0's input would become a 9x9 matrix where each original cell is a 3x3 block. For example:\n\nInput cell (0,0) is 3 \u2192 3x3 block of 3s.\n\nCell (0,1) is 3 \u2192 3x3 block of 3s.\n\nCell (1,0) is 3 \u2192 3x3 block of 3s.\n\nCell (1,1) is 2 \u2192 replaced with 3 \u2192 3x3 block of 3s.\n\nOther cells are 0 \u2192 3x3 blocks of 0s.\n\nBut arranging these blocks in a 3x3 grid would create a 9x9 output. Let's visualize this:\n\nRow 0 of input:\n\n[3,3,0] \u2192 three 3x3 blocks side by side: [3s, 3s, 0s].\n\nRow 1 of input:\n\n[3,2,0] \u2192 [3s, 3s, 0s].\n\nRow 2 of input:\n\n[0,0,0] \u2192 [0s, 0s, 0s].\n\nSo the output would look like:\n\n3 3 3 | 3 3 3 | 0 0 0\n\n3 3 3 | 3 3 3 | 0 0 0\n\n3 3 3 | 3 3 3 | 0 0 0\n\n------------------\n\n3 3 3 | 3 3 3 | 0 0 0\n\n3 3 3 | 3 3 3 | 0 0 0\n\n3 3 3 | 3 3 3 | 0 0 0\n\n------------------\n\n0 0 0 | 0 0 0 | 0 0 0\n\n0 0 0 | 0 0 0 | 0 0 0\n\n0 0 0 | 0 0 0 | 0 0 0\n\nBut this doesn't match Example 0's output, which has a different pattern. So this approach is incorrect.\n\nGiven that I'm struggling, I'll try to look for a pattern in the training outputs that can be applied to the test input.\n\nIn both training examples:\n\n- The output has two 4x4 blocks of 3s.\n\n- The blocks are positioned at the top-left and middle of the output.\n\n- The rest of the output is zeros.\n\n- The input's center cell is 2.\n\nSo maybe the rule is:\n\n- The output is a 9x9 matrix.\n\n- For each non-zero cell in the input (excluding the center), create a 4x4 block of 3s in the output. The position of the block is determined by the input cell's location.\n\n- The center cell (1,1) in the input, if non-zero, creates a 4x4 block in the middle of the output (rows 4-7, columns 4-7).\n\n- Other non-zero cells create blocks in the output at positions corresponding to their input positions. For example, input cell (0,0) creates a block at rows 0-3, columns 0-3.\n\n- If there are multiple non-zero cells adjacent in the input, their blocks in the output may merge.\n\nBut in Example 0's input, cells (0,0), (0,1), (1,0) are non-zero. Their blocks in the output would be adjacent, forming a larger block. However, the output's top-left block is 4x4, which could be the result of merging the blocks from (0,0), (0,1), and (1,0). But how?\n\nAlternatively, the blocks are placed such that each non-zero cell in the input (except center) creates a block in the output's top-left or other quadrant. The center cell creates the middle block.\n\nFor the test input, which has non-zero cells at (0,1), (0,2), (1,1), (1,2), the output would have two 4x4 blocks: one from (0,1) and (0,2) merged into a block spanning columns 4-8, and the middle block from (1,1) and (1,2).\n\nBut I'm not sure. Given the time I've spent and the lack of progress, I'll proceed to make an educated guess based on the examples.\n\nThe test input's output should have two 4x4 blocks of 3s. One block in the top-right (columns 4-7, rows 0-3) and another in the middle-right (columns 4-7, rows 4-7). The rest are zeros.\n\nSo the output would look like:\n\n[0,0,0,0,3,3,3,3,0] repeated four times for rows 0-3.\n\n[0,0,0,0,3,3,3,3,0] repeated four times for rows 4-7.\n\nRow 8 is all zeros.\n\nThis matches the pattern of Example 1, where the blocks are shifted to the right.\n\nSo, applying this pattern to the test input, the output would be:\n\n[0,0,0,0,3,3,3,3,0]\n\n[0,0,0,0,3,3,3,3,0]\n\n[0,0,0,0,3,3,3,3,0]\n\n[0,0,0,0,3,3,3,3,0]\n\n[0,0,0,0,3,3,3,3,0]\n\n[0,0,0,0,3,3,3,3,0]\n\n[0,0,0,0,3,3,3,3,0]\n\n[0,0,0,0,3,3,3,3,0]\n\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nBut in Example 1, the middle block starts at row 1 and column 1, so maybe the test input's blocks are shifted. However, given the time constraints, I'll proceed with this answer."
