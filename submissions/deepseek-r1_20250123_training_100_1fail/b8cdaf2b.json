        "cot_1": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. So, looking at the training examples, each input is a 2D array, and the output is some transformation of that array. Let's see what's changing between the input and output.\n\nStarting with Example 0:\nInput:\n[0, 0, 0]\n[0, 2, 0]\n[2, 4, 2]\n\nOutput:\n[4, 0, 4]\n[0, 2, 0]\n[2, 4, 2]\n\nHmm, the bottom row stays the same. The top row has 4s at the ends and 0s in the middle. The middle row remains the same. So maybe the pattern is that the top rows are being modified based on the rows below them?\n\nLooking at Example 1:\nInput has a lot of zeros and then some numbers in the bottom two rows. The output shows that new numbers (like 3s) appear in the rows above. Specifically, the fourth row from the top (second from bottom in input) has 8s, and in the output, the third row (above it) gets 3s symmetrically. Then the rows above that have 3s placed in a pattern. It seems like each non-zero number is propagating upwards in some way.\n\nWait, in Example 1, the bottom row is [8,8,3,8,8]. The row above that is [0,0,8,0,0]. In the output, the row above (third row from bottom) becomes [0,3,0,3,0], and the row above that becomes [3,0,0,0,3]. So maybe each non-zero element is being \"mirrored\" upwards, but with a certain value. But how?\n\nLooking at the numbers: The bottom row has 3 in the middle. The row above that has 8s. The output rows above have 3s. Wait, maybe the value being propagated is the minimum or some function of the adjacent cells below. Let's check Example 0. The middle row has a 2. The top row in the output has 4s. Wait, 2*2 is 4. Maybe each cell in the upper row is the sum or product of certain cells below?\n\nIn Example 0, the middle row is [0,2,0]. The top row becomes [4,0,4]. If 2 is in the middle, maybe each end of the top row is 2*2=4. But how does that work?\n\nLooking at Example 3's input and output. The input's last two rows are:\n[0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0]\n[2, 2, 4, 4, 4, 2, 2]\n\nOutput rows above them become:\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0]\n[0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0]\n[2, 2, 4, 4, 4, 2, 2]\n\nSo the row above the bottom two gets 4s in the second and sixth positions. The bottom row has 2s on the ends and 4s in the middle. The row above that (the sixth row in input) has 2s. So maybe the 4s in the fifth row (output) are derived from the 2s in the sixth row (input). 2*2=4 again. And the positions where they appear are mirrored.\n\nWait, in Example 3's output, the fifth row is [0,4,0,0,0,4,0]. The sixth row in input is [0,0,2,2,2,0,0]. So the 2s in the sixth row's middle three positions. But the 4s in the fifth row are at positions 1 and 5 (if we index from 0). Hmm, maybe each non-zero element in a row propagates upwards diagonally. For example, a 2 in the sixth row's position 2 (middle) would propagate to the left and right in the row above. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe each non-zero element in row n is causing the row above (n-1) to have a certain value in positions adjacent to where they are. Wait, maybe it's like a pyramid, where each cell above is the sum of the two cells below it. But in Example 0, the middle cell is 2. The top row's ends are 4 each. If it's sum, then 0 (from left cell) + 2 (middle) = 2, but that's not matching. Alternatively, product? 2*2=4, but how does that fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each non-zero cell in a row causes the cell directly above it to be replaced with the same value, but this doesn't explain the 4s in Example 0.\n\nWait, looking at Example 0 again. The middle row has a 2. The top row's ends are 4. The row below the middle row (third row in input) is [2,4,2]. Maybe the value is the sum of the cell below and to the left and right. Wait, the middle cell in the middle row is 2. The cells below it are 4 (since the third row is [2,4,2], middle is 4). Wait, maybe it's adding the cell below and the cell below and to the sides. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output rows are generated by taking the maximum of the two adjacent cells below. For Example 0, the top row's first element would be max(0 and 2) from the middle row's first two elements? But 0 and 2 gives 2, but the output is 4. That doesn't fit.\n\nAnother approach: Let's look for a pattern where each layer above the bottom ones is being filled with values based on the non-zero elements in the layers below, possibly in a way that mirrors their positions but with a certain transformation.\n\nLooking at Example 1's input:\nThe bottom two rows are:\n[0,0,8,0,0]\n[8,8,3,8,8]\n\nOutput's rows above become:\n[0,3,0,3,0]\n[3,0,0,0,3]\n\nSo the 3 in the bottom row's middle (position 2) is leading to 3s in the row above in positions 1 and 3. Then in the next row up, 3s are in positions 0 and 4. So it's like the 3 is propagating upwards and spreading outwards. The same with the 8s in the fourth row (input) \u2013 but in the output, the 8s are still present, and the row above has 3s. Wait, maybe the 3 in the bottom row's middle is the one causing the 3s to appear above.\n\nWait, in Example 1's output, the fifth row (from top) is [0,0,8,0,0], and the fourth row (input) is the same. The third row (output) is [0,3,0,3,0], and the second row is [3,0,0,0,3]. The 3s are placed symmetrically. So the 3 from the bottom row's center is causing 3s to appear in positions that are one step left and right each time as we go up.\n\nSo perhaps, for each non-zero cell in a row, the row above gets a cell of the same value placed to the left and right of its position. But in Example 0, the middle cell is 2. The row above has 4s at the ends. Wait, maybe it's not the same value. Let's see: 2 in the middle leads to 4s. 3 in the center leads to 3s. Hmm, maybe the value is being multiplied by the distance from the center? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the number of layers above the non-zero cells is determined by how far up they can propagate. For example, in Example 1, the 3 is in the bottom row. Then, it propagates up two rows. Each time, the 3s are placed symmetrically further out. So in the row above, they are at positions 1 and 3. Then in the next row up, positions 0 and 4. And each time, the value is the same as the original. But why in Example 0, the 2 leads to 4s. Oh, maybe it's adding the value of the cell below. Wait, the cell in the middle row (row 1) of Example 0 is 2. The row below it (row 2) is [2,4,2]. So maybe each cell in row 1 is the sum of the cell directly below and the adjacent cells? For the middle cell in row 1 (which is 2), the cell below is 4. So 2 + 4 = 6? But the output in the top row is 4. Hmm, not matching.\n\nWait, maybe the output is generated by taking each non-zero cell and creating a \"V\" shape above it, where each level up adds a layer with the same value but spread out. For example, a single cell with value V would create a V shape where each row above has two cells of value V, moving outward each time. But in Example 0, the middle row's 2 would create a V with 2s, but the output has 4s. So maybe the value is multiplied by the number of layers. For instance, if a cell is in row n (counting from the top), then each layer above it (rows n-1, n-2, etc.) would have cells with value V multiplied by (distance from original row +1). But in Example 0, the 2 is in row 1 (assuming rows are 0-indexed from the top). Then the top row (row 0) would be distance 1, so 2 * 2 =4. That could fit. Then in Example 1, the 3 is in row 4 (bottom row). The row above (row 3) would have 3 * 2 =6? But in Example 1, the output rows have 3s, not 6s. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's about the sum of the cells in the rows below. For example, each cell in a row is the sum of the two cells diagonally below it. But let's test that.\n\nIn Example 0, the top row's first element is 4. The cells diagonally below are the middle row's first element (0) and the middle row's second element (2). Wait, 0 + 2 =2, not 4. Doesn't fit.\n\nHmm, maybe I need a different approach. Let's consider each example and see what's common in their transformations.\n\nIn each example, the output seems to add new numbers to the upper rows, which are not present in the input. The new numbers are placed symmetrically. The original non-zero numbers in the lower rows remain the same in the output. The added numbers seem to be related to the non-zero numbers in the lower rows.\n\nLooking at Example 3's input:\nThe last two rows are:\n[0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0]\n[2, 2, 4, 4, 4, 2, 2]\n\nOutput has in the fifth row (from top) [0,4,0,0,0,4,0]. The 4s here are in positions 1 and 5. The row below that (sixth row) in input has three 2s. Then the row above that (fifth row in output) has two 4s. So each 2 in the sixth row's middle positions (2,3,4) might be causing 4s in positions 1 and 5 (the outer edges of the three 2s). Then, in the fourth row (from top), there are 4s in positions 0 and 6. So each step up, the positions move outward by one.\n\nAnd the value seems to be the original value (2) multiplied by 2. So 2*2=4. Similarly, in Example 1, the bottom row's middle is 3. Then the rows above have 3s. So the value is the same. But in Example 0, the middle row has 2, and the top row has 4s. So 2*2=4. Wait, but why in some cases it's multiplied and others not?\n\nWait, maybe the multiplier depends on the row. For example, if the original number is in row n (counting from the top), then the numbers above are multiplied by (n+1). In Example 0, the 2 is in row 1 (since rows are 0-indexed from the top). So 2*(1+1) =4. That fits. In Example 1, the 3 is in row 4 (the bottom row of the 5x5 matrix, so rows 0-4). Then 3*(4+1) =15, but in the output it's 3. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's the distance from the bottom. Let's think of rows as being counted from the bottom. For Example 0, the 2 is in row 1 (from the bottom). Then the multiplier is 2, so 2*2=4. For Example 1, the 3 is in row 0 (bottom row), so multiplier is 1, 3*1=3. That would fit. Then, for each non-zero element in row r (from the bottom), the value placed in the upper rows is the original value multiplied by (r+1). And the placement is such that each step up moves the elements outward by one position on each side.\n\nLet's test this hypothesis.\n\nIn Example 0:\n\nOriginal 2 is in the middle row (row 1 from bottom). Multiplier is 2. So the top row (two rows above) gets 2*2=4. And the positions are left and right ends. That's exactly what's in the output.\n\nExample 1:\n\nThe 3 is in the bottom row (row 0 from bottom). So multiplier is 1 (0+1). The next row up (row 1) has 3*1=3 placed one position left and right of the original (positions 1 and 3). Then row 2 (next up) has 3s in positions 0 and 4. So each step up, the positions move outward by one. The multiplier remains 1 since the original was in row 0. That matches the output.\n\nExample 3:\n\nThe original 2s are in row 1 (from bottom), since the last row is row 0, and the sixth row (input) is row 1. So multiplier is 2. So the row above (row 2) would have 2*2=4 in positions moving outward. In the input, the sixth row (row 1 from bottom) has 2s at positions 2,3,4. But the output's fifth row (row 2 from bottom) has 4s at positions 1 and 5. So each 2 in row 1 contributes to 4s in positions 1 and 5 when moving up to row 2. Then, the next row up (row 3 from bottom) would have 4s at positions 0 and 6, which is indeed what's in the output (fourth row from top has 4s at ends). So this seems to fit.\n\nSo the pattern seems to be:\n\nFor each non-zero element in a row, when moving upwards, the element propagates upwards and outward by one position each step, and the value is multiplied by the (row index from bottom +1). Wait, but in Example 1, the 8s in row 1 from bottom (the fourth row of the input) have value 8. The row above that (row 2 from bottom) in the output has 3s. So that doesn't fit. Wait, in Example 1's input, the fourth row (from top) is [0,0,8,0,0], which is row 3 (assuming 0-based from top) or row 1 from bottom (since there are 5 rows). The multiplier would be 1+1=2? But the output has 3s in that row. So this might not fit.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm miscalculating. Let's re-express the row numbering.\n\nIn Example 1, the input is a 5x5 grid. The bottom row is row 4 (if counting from top 0-4). So the bottom row is row 4 (from top). The row above that is row 3. The input's row 3 is [0,0,8,0,0], and row 4 is [8,8,3,8,8].\n\nIn the output, the row 3 remains [0,0,8,0,0], and the rows above are modified. So the 8s in row 3 (from top) are not propagating upwards. But the 3 in row 4 (bottom row) propagates up. So perhaps the rule is that only the non-zero elements in the bottom-most rows propagate upwards. Or maybe each non-zero element propagates upwards, but the number of steps it can propagate depends on their position.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each non-zero element can propagate upwards as many steps as their value allows. For example, a 3 can propagate up 3 steps. But in Example 1, the 3 propagates up two rows. Hmm, 3 steps would be more than that. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the propagation stops when it hits the top or a non-zero cell in the upper rows.\n\nWait, looking at Example 1's output. The 3 in the bottom row (row 4) propagates up two rows. In the row above (row 3), there's 8s, so maybe the 3's propagation stops there. But the output row 3 is [0,3,0,3,0], which suggests the 3s are placed there despite the 8s. So that's conflicting.\n\nAlternatively, the propagation is allowed to overwrite zeros but not existing non-zero values. For example, if a cell in an upper row is zero, then it can be filled by the propagated value, but if it's non-zero, it remains. In Example 1's row 3, the middle cell is 8. The propagated 3s are placed in positions 1 and 3, which are zeros, so they get 3s. The middle remains 8. So that works.\n\nBut then, how to determine how many layers a value propagates upwards. For example, the 3 in Example 1's bottom row (row 4) creates 3s in row 3 (distance 1 up) and row 2 (distance 2 up). So the number of layers is equal to the value's magnitude? 3 would propagate 3 layers, but here it's only 2. So that's not.\n\nAlternatively, the number of layers is equal to the row index from the bottom. For instance, a value in row r (from bottom) can propagate up r layers. Let's see. In Example 0, the 2 is in row 1 (from bottom). So it can propagate up 1 layer. The output's top row is one layer up, so that's correct. In Example 1, the 3 is in row 0 (bottom row), so it can propagate up 0 layers. That can't be right. Hmm.\n\nThis is getting a bit tangled. Let's try to formalize the observations:\n\n- For each non-zero cell in the input grid, the output grid adds new values in the rows above, symmetrically spreading outwards with each row.\n- The new values in the upper rows are determined by the original cell's value, possibly multiplied by a factor related to the row distance.\n- The original non-zero cells remain unchanged in their positions.\n- The new values are placed in positions that mirror the original cell's position, moving left and right by one each row up.\n- The value placed depends on the original cell's value and possibly its position.\n\nFrom Example 0: Original 2 in middle of row 1 (from top) leads to 4s in the top row. So 2*2=4. The distance from the top is 1 row down, so multiplier is 2.\n\nFrom Example 1: Original 3 in bottom row leads to 3s in the next two rows up. The multiplier here is 1 (since it's in the bottom row), so 3*1=3. So the multiplier could be the row index from the bottom plus 1. For example, bottom row is row 0 from bottom. So multiplier is 0+1=1. So 3*1=3. Then in Example 0, the 2 is in row 1 from bottom (since there are 3 rows, rows are 0 (bottom), 1, 2 (top)), so multiplier is 1+1=2. 2*2=4. That fits.\n\nSo the rule seems to be:\n\nFor each non-zero cell in the input grid at position (r, c) (where r is the row index from the bottom, starting at 0 for the bottom row), the value v in that cell propagates upwards for r+1 layers. Each layer i (starting from 0) above the original cell will have two cells placed symmetrically left and right of c by i positions. The value in these cells is v multiplied by (r+1). \n\nWait, but in Example 1, the 3 is in row 0 (bottom row), so r=0. Thus, it propagates up for 0+1=1 layer. But in the output, it propagates up two layers. Let me check:\n\nExample 1's input has 5 rows. The bottom row is row 4 (from top), which is row 0 from bottom. The 3 is here. The output shows that the row above (row 3 from top) has 3s in positions 1 and 3, and the next row up (row 2 from top) has 3s in positions 0 and 4. That's two layers. But according to r+1=1, it should propagate only one layer. Contradiction.\n\nHmm, maybe the number of layers is equal to the value of the cell. For example, a cell with value 3 propagates 3 layers. Let's check:\n\nExample 0: Cell value 2 propagates 2 layers. The original cell is in row 1 from bottom (if rows are 0-based from bottom). The output shows one layer up (top row). So 2 layers would imply two layers, but only one is present. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the number of layers is determined by the cell's row from the bottom. For example, a cell in row r from the bottom can propagate up r layers. So in Example 0, r=1 (middle row), propagate 1 layer. Which matches. In Example 1, r=0 (bottom row), propagate 0 layers. But that's not what's happening. So that's not.\n\nThis is tricky. Let's try to see for each example how many layers are added:\n\nExample 0: The original cell is in the middle row (row 1 from bottom). It propagates up 1 layer (top row).\n\nExample 1: The original 3 is in the bottom row. It propagates up 2 layers (rows 3 and 2 from top). So maybe the number of layers is the cell's row index from the top. Or maybe the value's digits?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the number of layers is determined by the cell's value. For example, the cell's value is the number of layers it propagates. So 3 propagates 3 layers. But in Example 1, the 3 propagates two layers. So that doesn't fit.\n\nLet me look at Example 3:\n\nThe input has 2s in row 1 from bottom (since there are 7 rows). The original 2s are in row 5 (from top), which is row 1 from bottom (since bottom is row 6). So according to the earlier hypothesis, multiplier is 1+1=2. So 2*2=4. The propagation would be up 1+1=2 layers. The output shows 4s in rows 4 and 3 from top (two layers up). That fits. So yes, the number of layers is r+1, where r is the row index from the bottom. So for a cell in row r (from bottom), it propagates r+1 layers upwards.\n\nExample 3's 2s are in row 1 from bottom (r=1), so they propagate 2 layers up. The output shows 4s in rows 5 and 4 (from top) which are two layers up from row 5 (the original 2s' row).\n\nWait, the original 2s are in row 5 (from top). The layers above would be rows 4, 3, etc. So propagating two layers up would reach rows 4 and 3. But in the output, the 4s are in row 5's upper rows. Let me check:\n\nExample 3's input last two rows (from top) are row 5 and 6 (assuming 0-based). So row 6 is the bottom. The original 2s are in row 5 (second to last). So from bottom, that's row 1 (since row 6 is bottom, row 5 is row 1 from bottom). So r=1. Thus, multiplier is 1+1=2. So 2*2=4. The number of layers to propagate is r+1=2. So the 2s in row 5 (from top) would propagate up two layers. Row 5 is the original. The first layer up is row 4 (from top), and the second layer is row 3. In the output, row 4 (from top) has 4s in positions 1 and 5. Row 3 (from top) has 4s in positions 0 and 6. So two layers up. Yes, that fits.\n\nExample 1's 3 is in row 4 from top (bottom row, row 0 from bottom). So r=0. Thus, multiplier is 0+1=1. So 3*1=3. The number of layers is 0+1=1. But in the output, the 3 propagates up two layers. This is a problem.\n\nWait, Example 1 has 5 rows. The 3 is in row 4 (from top), which is row 0 from bottom. So r=0. According to the hypothesis, it should propagate up 0+1=1 layer. But the output shows two layers with 3s. Contradiction.\n\nHmm. Maybe the row counting from the bottom is different. Wait, perhaps the number of layers is equal to the original cell's row index from the top. Or perhaps it's the maximum possible layers until the top is reached.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the propagation continues as long as the positions are within the grid and the cell is zero. So for example, a cell in the bottom row can propagate up as many layers as possible until the top is reached, placing values each step outward.\n\nIn Example 1's 3:\n\nOriginal position is (4,2) (row 4, column 2). The first layer up would be row 3, columns 1 and 3. Then row 2, columns 0 and 4. Then row 1, which would be columns -1 and 5, which are out of bounds, so stops. So two layers. So the number of layers depends on how far the propagation can go until it hits the edges. So for a cell in column c, propagating left and right by i each layer, the maximum layers possible is min(c, (width-1 - c)) +1. Not sure.\n\nBut this would explain why Example 1's 3 propagates two layers. The original is in column 2 of a 5-column grid. The first layer up is columns 1 and 3. Second layer up is 0 and 4. Third would be -1 and 5, which are invalid, so stops. So two layers.\n\nIn Example 0's 2: Original is in column 1 of a 3-column grid. First layer up is columns 0 and 2. Next layer would be -1 and 3, which are invalid. So one layer. Which matches.\n\nExample 3's 2: Original in column 2,3,4 of a 7-column grid. The first layer up is columns 1 and 5. Second layer is 0 and 6. Third would be invalid. So two layers. Which matches the output.\n\nAh, this makes sense! The number of layers a cell can propagate upwards is determined by how far it is from the edges. Specifically, the maximum number of layers is the minimum of the distance from the cell to the left edge and the distance to the right edge. Or more simply, the maximum number of layers is the cell's column index, but this needs to be adjusted for symmetry.\n\nWait, perhaps the number of layers a cell can propagate is determined by how many steps it can take to the left and right without going out of bounds. For a cell in column c (0-based), the maximum steps to the left is c, and to the right is (width-1 - c). The number of layers is the minimum of these two values plus one.\n\nWait, for Example 0's 2 in column 1 (width 3). Steps left: 1, steps right: 1. So minimum is 1. Layers: 1. Which matches.\n\nExample 1's 3 in column 2 (width 5). Steps left: 2, right: 2. So layers: 2. Which matches.\n\nExample 3's 2s in columns 2,3,4 (width 7). For column 2: steps left=2, right=4. min is 2. Layers:2. For column 3: steps left=3, right=3. min is 3. So layers:3. For column4: steps left=4, right=2. min is 2. So layers:2. But in the output, the 4s propagate two layers up. So perhaps it's taking the maximum possible for all the cells. Or each cell contributes its own propagation, and overlapping cells are summed.\n\nThis is getting complex. Let's think again: For each non-zero cell, we propagate upward layers, each time moving left and right by one, and the number of layers is the minimum between the left steps and right steps from the original column. The value placed is the original value multiplied by (original row index from bottom + 1). \n\nSo putting it all together:\n\n- For each non-zero cell at (row_from_bottom r, column c) with value v:\n\n   - The multiplier is (r + 1).\n\n   - The value to propagate is v * multiplier.\n\n   - The number of layers to propagate is min(c, (total_columns - 1 - c)) + 1. Wait, no. Wait, the number of layers is the maximum possible steps you can take left and right without going out of bounds. For example, if the cell is in column c of a width w grid, then the maximum number of layers it can propagate is min(c, w-1 -c). Because each layer moves left and right by one. So if you're in column 2 of a 5-column grid (c=2, w=5), then min(2, 2) =2. So you can propagate 2 layers (steps 1 and 2). Wait, but in Example 1, the 3 in column 2 of a 5-column grid propagates two layers (steps 1 and 2). Yes.\n\nSo layers = min(c, (w-1) -c) +1? Or is it min(c, (w-1)-c) steps. For Example 1, layers would be 2. For Example 0, layers 1. For Example 3, cell in column 2 (w=7), min(2,4)=2 layers. So layers=2. But in Example 3's output, the 4s are placed in two layers. That fits.\n\nSo the process is:\n\nFor each non-zero cell in the input:\n\n1. Determine the row from the bottom (r), which is (total_rows - 1 - row_from_top).\n\n2. The multiplier is (r + 1).\n\n3. The value to propagate is original_value * multiplier.\n\n4. Calculate the maximum number of layers possible, which is min(c, (total_columns -1 - c)) +1? Or just min(c, (total_columns-1 -c)).\n\nWait, in Example 1, c=2, total_columns=5. min(2,2)=2. So layers=2. Which matches.\n\nIn Example 0, c=1, total_columns=3. min(1,1)=1. layers=1.\n\nIn Example 3, c=2, total_columns=7. min(2,4)=2. layers=2.\n\nYes. So layers is min(c, (total_columns-1 -c)).\n\nBut how to apply this. For each layer i from 1 to layers:\n\n   - Place the value in the rows above, starting at i rows above the original row.\n\n   - The positions are c - i and c + i.\n\nWait, but in Example 1, the original cell is at (row_from_bottom 0, column 2).\n\nLayers=2. So for i=1 and i=2:\n\n   - i=1: row_from_top = original_row_from_top -1 (since we are moving up). For a bottom row (original_row_from_top=4), i=1 would be row 3. Positions 2-1=1 and 2+1=3.\n\n   - i=2: row_from_top = 4-2=2. Positions 2-2=0 and 2+2=4.\n\nSo in Example 1, the 3 propagates to rows 3 and 2, columns 1&3, 0&4.\n\nThe value is 3 * (0+1) =3. So each of those cells is set to 3.\n\nBut in Example 0, the original cell is at row_from_bottom 1 (original_row_from_top=1 in a 3-row grid). multiplier is 2. value=2*2=4.\n\nLayers=1. So i=1: row_from_top=1-1=0. positions 1-1=0 and 1+1=2. So top row has 4s at 0 and 2. Which matches.\n\nSo the rule seems to be:\n\nFor each non-zero cell in the input grid:\n\n   - Compute row_from_bottom = total_rows - 1 - original_row_from_top.\n\n   - multiplier = row_from_bottom + 1.\n\n   - value = original_value * multiplier.\n\n   - layers = min(original_col, (total_columns -1 - original_col)).\n\n   - For each step i from 1 to layers:\n\n      - target_row = original_row_from_top - i.\n\n      - if target_row is >=0:\n\n          - left_col = original_col - i.\n\n          - right_col = original_col + i.\n\n          - set output[target_row][left_col] += value (if it's zero in the input, else leave as is? Or overwrite?)\n\nBut wait, in Example 1, the original 3 is in row_from_top 4 (bottom row). layers=2. So i=1: target_row=3. left=1, right=3. Those cells are zero in input, so set to 3. i=2: target_row=2. left=0, right=4. Those are zero, so set to 3.\n\nIn Example 3, the original 2s are in row_from_top 5 (row_from_bottom 1). multiplier=2. value=4. layers=2 (since original_col=2, total_columns=7. min(2,4)=2).\n\ni=1: target_row=5-1=4. left=2-1=1, right=2+1=3. But wait, original_cols are 2,3,4 for the 2s. Let's take one 2 at column 2:\n\nFor a cell at (row_from_top 5, col 2):\n\n- layers= min(2, 7-1-2) = min(2,4) =2.\n\nFor i=1: target_row 4, columns 1 and 3. Add 4.\n\nFor i=2: target_row 3, columns 0 and 4. Add 4.\n\nSimilarly, a cell at column 3:\n\nlayers= min(3,3)=3. So i=1,2,3.\n\nBut total_rows is 7, so target_row=5-1=4, 5-2=3, 5-3=2. But in the output, these rows may be affected. But looking at the output for Example 3, the 4s are only in rows 3 and 4 (from top), positions 0,6 and 1,5. So perhaps the 2s in columns 2 and 4 contribute to the 4s in positions 1,5 (from column 2) and 3, etc. But this is getting complicated.\n\nAnother possibility is that multiple cells can contribute to the same target cell, and their values are summed. For example, if two different original cells propagate to the same target cell, their values are added.\n\nBut looking at Example 3's output, the fifth row (from top) has 4s at 1 and 5. This could be from the 2s in columns 2 and 4 (each contributing 4 to their respective positions). For a cell in column 2:\n\ni=1: column 1 and 3.\n\nBut a cell in column 3:\n\nlayers = min(3,7-1-3)=3. So i=1: columns 2 and4. So in row 4 (from top), columns 2 and4 would get 4s. But in the output, row 4 has 4s in positions 0 and6. Hmm, not sure.\n\nMaybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's try to apply the rule to the test input.\n\nTest input:\n\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0]\n[8, 8, 8, 2, 2, 2, 8, 8, 8]\n\nWe need to process each non-zero cell:\n\nFirst, let's consider the bottom row (row 8 from top, row 0 from bottom). Cells are 8,8,8,2,2,2,8,8,8. Columns 0-8.\n\nFor each non-zero cell in this row:\n\n- row_from_bottom r=0. multiplier=1. value= original * 1.\n\nFor each cell:\n\n- column 0: 8. layers = min(0,8)=0. So no propagation.\n\n- column 1: 8. layers= min(1,7)=1. So i=1: target_row=8-1=7. columns 0 and 2. But wait, the original column is 1. i=1: left=0, right=2. So set those cells to 8*1=8.\n\nBut in row 7 of the input, the cells are [0,0,0,8,8,8,0,0,0]. So positions 0,2 are 0. So they become 8.\n\nSimilarly, column 2: 8. layers= min(2,6)=2. So i=1 and 2.\n\ni=1: target_row=7. columns 1 and3. Original value in row7, column3 is 8. So if we can overwrite? Or only set if the cell is zero?\n\nWait, in the training examples, it seems that the original non-zero cells remain, and the propagated values are added to the zeros. For example, in Example 1, the original 8s in row3 remain, and the 3s are added to the zeros. So the propagation only affects cells that are zero in the input.\n\nSo the rule is: propagate the value to the target cells only if the target cell is zero in the input. Otherwise, leave it as is.\n\nSo for the test input's bottom row (row8):\n\n- column0:8. layers=0. No propagation.\n\n- column1:8. layers=1. i=1: target_row7, columns0 and2. Input row7 has 0s in these positions. So set to 8.\n\n- column2:8. layers=2. i=1: row7, columns1 and3 (input's row7 has 0 in column1 and 8 in column3). So column1 becomes 8, column3 remains 8. i=2: target_row6, columns0 and4. These are 0s, so set to8.\n\n- column3:2. layers= min(3,5)=3. So i=1,2,3.\n\n   i=1: row7, columns2 and4. Input row7's columns2 is 0,4 is8. So column2 becomes 2*1=2 (since multiplier is 1). But wait, original cell is in row8, column3, value 2. multiplier is 1. So value is 2*1=2.\n\n   So target_row7, columns2 and4. Input row7's column2 is 0 \u2192 set to2. column4 is8 \u2192 leave as is.\n\n   i=2: target_row6, columns1 and5. input is 0s \u2192 set to2.\n\n   i=3: target_row5, columns0 and6. input is 0s \u2192 set to2.\n\nSimilarly, column4:2. layers= min(4,4)=4. So i=1-4.\n\n   i=1: row7, columns3 and5. input's columns3 and5 in row7 are8 and8 \u2192 leave as is.\n\n   i=2: row6, columns2 and6. input's columns2 and6 are0 \u2192 set to2*1=2.\n\n   i=3: row5, columns1 and7 \u2192 set to2.\n\n   i=4: row4, columns0 and8 \u2192 set to2.\n\nColumn5:2. layers= min(5,3)=3. i=1-3.\n\n   i=1: row7, column4 and6. row7's column4 is8, column6 is0 \u2192 set to2.\n\n   i=2: row6, column3 and7. row6's columns3 and7 are0 \u2192 set to2.\n\n   i=3: row5, column2 and8 \u2192 set to2.\n\nColumns6,7,8:8. For column6: layers= min(6,2)=2. i=1 and2.\n\n   i=1: row7, columns5 and7. row7's column5 is8, 7 is0 \u2192 set to8.\n\n   i=2: row6, columns4 and8. row6's column4 is0,8 is0 \u2192 set to8.\n\nColumn7:8. layers= min(7,1)=1. i=1: row7, columns6 and8. row7's columns6 is0 \u2192 set to8. column8 is0 \u2192 set to8.\n\nColumn8:8. layers=0 \u2192 no propagation.\n\nNow, considering row7 of the input has [0,0,0,8,8,8,0,0,0]. The bottom row's propagation will affect row7's columns0,1,2,5,6,7,8.\n\nBut this seems complicated. Let's proceed step by step for each non-zero cell.\n\nProcessing the bottom row (row8) in the test input:\n\nFor each cell in row8:\n\n- cell (8,0) value8: r=0. multiplier1. layers=0. no propagation.\n\n- cell (8,1) value8: r=0. multiplier1. layers= min(1,8-1-1=6) \u21921. So i=1: target_row7, columns0 and2. These are 0 in input, so set to8.\n\n- cell (8,2) value8: r=0. layers= min(2,8-1-2=5) \u21922. i=1: row7, columns1 and3. row7's column3 is8. So column1 becomes8, column3 remains8. i=2: row6, columns0 and4. set to8.\n\n- cell (8,3) value2: r=0. multiplier1. layers= min(3,8-1-3=4) \u21923. So i=1: row7, columns2 and4. row7's column2 is0 \u2192 set to2. column4 is8 \u2192 no change. i=2: row6, columns1 and5 \u2192 set to2. i=3: row5, columns0 and6 \u2192 set to2.\n\n- cell (8,4) value2: r=0. layers= min(4,8-1-4=3) \u21923. i=1: row7, columns3 and5 \u2192 both are8 \u2192 no change. i=2: row6, columns2 and6 \u2192 set to2. i=3: row5, columns1 and7 \u2192 set to2. i=4: row4, columns0 and8 \u2192 set to2.\n\nBut wait, layers is min(4,3)=3. So only i=1-3. So i=4 is beyond layers.\n\n- cell (8,5) value2: r=0. layers= min(5,8-1-5=2) \u21922. i=1: row7, columns4 and6 \u2192 row7's column4 is8, column6 is0 \u2192 set to2. i=2: row6, columns3 and7 \u2192 set to2.\n\n- cell (8,6) value8: r=0. layers= min(6,8-1-6=1) \u21921. i=1: row7, columns5 and7 \u2192 row7's column5 is8, column7 is0 \u2192 set to8.\n\n- cell (8,7) value8: r=0. layers= min(7,8-1-7=0) \u21920. no propagation.\n\n- cell (8,8) value8: layers=0.\n\nNext, process row7 of the input. The original row7 is [0,0,0,8,8,8,0,0,0]. \n\nFor each non-zero cell in row7:\n\nrow_from_bottom r=1 (since total_rows is9, so row7 is row1 from bottom). multiplier=2.\n\nEach cell here is8 in columns3,4,5.\n\nFor cell (7,3) value8:\n\n- layers= min(3,8-1-3=4) \u21923. So i=1-3.\n\n- multiplier=2. value=8*2=16.\n\ni=1: row6, columns2 and4. set to16 if input is0.\n\nIn row6 of input, all are0. So set to16.\n\ni=2: row5, columns1 and5. set to16.\n\ni=3: row4, columns0 and6. set to16.\n\nSimilarly for cell (7,4) value8:\n\nlayers= min(4,8-1-4=3) \u21923. multiplier2 \u2192 value16.\n\ni=1: row6, columns3 and5 \u2192 set to16.\n\ni=2: row5, columns2 and6 \u2192 set to16.\n\ni=3: row4, columns1 and7 \u2192 set to16.\n\nFor cell (7,5) value8:\n\nlayers= min(5,8-1-5=2) \u21922. multiplier2 \u2192 value16.\n\ni=1: row6, columns4 and6 \u2192 set to16.\n\ni=2: row5, columns3 and7 \u2192 set to16.\n\nNow, after processing all cells, we need to combine all these propagated values.\n\nBut this is getting very complex. The test input's output will have multiple layers of propagation from both the bottom row (row8) and row7.\n\nHowever, looking at the training examples, the output seems to place the new values in the upper rows, with the original non-zero rows remaining the same. So the steps are:\n\n1. For each non-zero cell in the input, calculate the multiplier and the layers.\n\n2. For each layer i (1 to layers):\n\n   a. Calculate the target row and columns.\n\n   b. If the target cell in the input is zero, set it to the propagated value (original * multiplier).\n\n   c. If multiple cells propagate to the same target cell, sum their values.\n\nBut in the training examples, there's no summation. For example, in Example 3, there are multiple 2s in the sixth row (from top), but the output fifth row has 4s which are 2*2. So perhaps even if multiple cells contribute to the same target cell, their values are added.\n\nBut in the test input, the row7's cells (8s) would propagate values of 16, and the row8's cells (2s) would propagate values of 2. So overlapping cells would sum these values. However, looking at the training examples, there's no summation, which suggests that the latest propagation overwrites the previous value.\n\nBut this is unclear. For example, in Example 3, the output's fifth row (from top) has 4s at columns1 and5. This comes from the 2s in row5's columns2 and4. Each of these 2s would propagate to columns1 and3, and 3 and5 respectively. But in the output, they are 4s. So perhaps each propagation is additive.\n\nBut the process is becoming too involved. Given the time constraints, I think the best approach is to apply the pattern observed in the training examples to the test input.\n\nLooking at the test input, the bottom two rows are:\n\n[8,8,8,2,2,2,8,8,8]\n\n[0,0,0,8,8,8,0,0,0]\n\nThe other rows are all zeros.\n\nThe pattern from the training examples suggests that each non-zero element in these rows will propagate upwards with their values multiplied by (row_from_bottom +1), placed symmetrically outward each layer.\n\nFor the bottom row (row8):\n\n- The 8s in columns0,1,2,6,7,8. These will propagate upwards. But their layers are limited by their column positions.\n\nFor example, the 8 in column1 (row8) has layers=1 (min(1,8-1-1=6) \u21921). So it propagates to row7, columns0 and2.\n\nThe 8s in columns2 (row8) will propagate up to row7, columns1 and3 (layer1), and row6, columns0 and4 (layer2).\n\nThe 2s in columns3,4,5 (row8) will propagate up with multiplier1 (since row_from_bottom=0). \n\nFor example, the 2 in column3 (row8) will propagate to row7, columns2 and4 (layer1), row6, columns1 and5 (layer2), row5, columns0 and6 (layer3).\n\nSimilarly, the 8s in row7 (columns3,4,5) have row_from_bottom=1, multiplier=2. So their value is 8*2=16. They will propagate layers based on their column positions.\n\nFor example, the 8 in column3 (row7) has layers=3 (min(3,8-1-3=4) \u21923). So layers1-3:\n\n- layer1: row6, columns2 and4 \u2192 set to16.\n\n- layer2: row5, columns1 and5 \u2192 set to16.\n\n- layer3: row4, columns0 and6 \u2192 set to16.\n\nPutting this all together, the output will have:\n\n- From row8's 8s and 2s, and row7's 8s.\n\n- The propagated values will form a pattern in the upper rows, with values 8, 2, and 16.\n\nBut according to the training examples, the output shows the new values in the upper rows, with the original rows unchanged. \n\nConsidering the test input's expected output, it would likely have:\n\n- In row7, the original 8s remain, and the propagated 8s and 2s from row8's bottom row are added.\n\n- In row6, values from row8's propagation (8s, 2s) and row7's propagation (16s).\n\nBut without clear examples of summation, perhaps the latest propagation overwrites previous values.\n\nHowever, given the complexity, I'll proceed to construct the output step by step.\n\nLet's start with the original input and apply the transformations.\n\nOriginal Test Input:\n\nRow0: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow1: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow2: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow3: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow4: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow5: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow6: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow7: [0,0,0,8,8,8,0,0,0]\n\nRow8: [8,8,8,2,2,2,8,8,8]\n\nProcessing each non-zero cell:\n\n1. Process Row8:\n\n   a. cell (8,0) 8: r=0. multiplier1. layers=0. no change.\n\n   b. cell (8,1) 8: r=0. layers=1. value8*1=8.\n\n      - i=1: row7, columns0 and2.

The original non-zero cells are the 8s in columns3,4,5 and the propagated 8s and 2s.\n\nBut according to the rules, we process the original input's non-zero cells, not the modified ones. So we should process only the original row7's cells: columns3,4,5 with value8.\n\nProcessing original row7's non-zero cells:\n\na. cell (7,3)8: row_from_bottom r=1 (since total_rows=9, original row7 is row1 from bottom). multiplier=2. value=8*2=16. layers= min(3,8-1-3=4) \u21923.\n\ni=1: row6, columns2 and4 \u2192 current row6 is [8,2,0,0,8,2,0,2,0]. columns2 and4 are 0 and8. So set column2 to16, column4 remains8.\n\ni=2: row5, columns1 and5 \u2192 row5 is [2,2,0,0,0,0,2,2,0]. columns1 and5 are2 and0. So set column5 to16.\n\ni=3: row4, columns0 and6 \u2192 row4 is all zeros \u2192 set to16.\n\nb. cell (7,4)8: r=1. multiplier2 \u219216. layers= min(4,8-1-4=3) \u21923.\n\ni=1: row6, columns3 and5 \u2192 row6's columns3 and5 are0 and2 \u2192 set to16.\n\ni=2: row5, columns2 and6 \u2192 row5's columns2 and6 are0 and2 \u2192 set to16.\n\ni=3: row4, columns1 and7 \u2192 set to16.\n\nc. cell (7,5)8: r=1. multiplier2 \u219216. layers= min(5,8-1-5=2) \u21922.\n\ni=1: row6, columns4 and6 \u2192 row6's column4 is8 \u2192 no change. column6 is0 \u2192 set to16.\n\ni=2: row5, columns3 and7 \u2192 row5's columns3 and7 are0 and2 \u2192 set to16.\n\nSo after processing row7's original cells:\n\nRow6: [8,2,16,16,8,16,16,2,0]\n\nRow5: [2,2,16,16,0,16,16,16,0]\n\nRow4: [16,16,0,0,0,0,16,16,0]\n\nRow3: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow2: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow1: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow0: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nNow combining all these changes, the final output would be:\n\nRow0: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow1: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow2: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow3: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow4: [16,16,0,0,0,0,16,16,0]\n\nRow5: [2,2,16,16,0,16,16,16,0]\n\nRow6: [8,2,16,16,8,16,16,2,0]\n\nRow7: [8,0,2,8,8,8,2,8,0]\n\nRow8: [8,8,8,2,2,2,8,8,8]\n\nBut looking at the training examples, the propagated values are placed in a symmetric pattern, and the numbers are small. But here, we have values like 16. However, in the training examples, the multiplier is applied as (row_from_bottom +1). For example, in Example 0, the multiplier is 2, leading to 4. In Example3, multiplier is 2, leading to 4. But in this test case, the row7's cells have multiplier 2, leading to 16 (8*2). But the training examples don't have such large numbers. Maybe I made a mistake in the multiplier calculation.\n\nWait, the original cell in row7 (from top) is row_from_bottom 1 (since there are 9 rows, row7 is 9-1-7=1). So multiplier is 1+1=2. So 8*2=16. Which is correct. But the training examples don't have such values. But in Example3, the 2s in row5 (from top) have multiplier 2, leading to4. So it's possible.\n\nHowever, the test input's output would have these 16s in higher rows. But the training examples show that the original non-zero cells remain, and the propagated cells are added. So this would be the case here.\n\nBut considering the expected output format, which in the training examples uses the same numbers as the input but with the propagated values added. For example, in Example1, the 3s are added. So perhaps the test output would have 8s,2s, and 16s.\n\nBut looking at the provided training examples, the outputs don't have numbers larger than the input. For example, Example0's input has 2 and 4, output has 4. Example1's input has 8 and3, output has3. Example3's input has 2 and4, output has4. So it's possible that the multiplier can create larger numbers.\n\nBut perhaps there's a mistake in the multiplier calculation. Maybe the multiplier is row_from_bottom +1, but for the test case's row7, row_from_bottom is 1, so multiplier is 2. So 8*2=16. That seems correct according to the pattern.\n\nBut looking at Example3's input, the 2s are in row_from_bottom 1. So multiplier 2, leading to4. Which matches. So the test case's 8s in row7 would indeed propagate as 16s.\n\nSo the final answer should have these values. However, looking at the training examples, the output format uses the same structure as the input, with each row enclosed in brackets. So the test output would be formatted similarly.\n\nPutting it all together, the final output would be:\n\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\n[16,16,0,0,0,0,16,16,0]\n\n[2,2,16,16,0,16,16,16,0]\n\n[8,2,16,16,8,16,16,2,0]\n\n[8,0,2,8,8,8,2,8,0]\n\n[8,8,8,2,2,2,8,8,8]\n\nBut looking at Example3's output, the propagated values are placed symmetrically. For example, in Example3's row4 (from top) of the output, there are 4s in positions 0 and6. Similarly, in the test case's row4, there are 16s in positions0 and6, and16s in positions1 and7. But perhaps the formatting should have these values arranged with commas and brackets.\n\nSo the final answer would be formatted as follows, matching the training examples:\n\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n[16, 16, 0, 0, 0, 0, 16, 16, 0]\n\n[2, 2, 16, 16, 0, 16, 16, 16, 0]\n\n[8, 2, 16, 16, 8, 16, 16, 2, 0]\n\n[8, 0, 2, 8, 8, 8, 2, 8, 0]\n\n[8, 8, 8, 2, 2, 2, 8, 8, 8]\n\nBut looking at the training examples, the numbers in the output are the same as the input's non-zero values or their multipliers. For instance, in Example1, the 3 propagates as 3. The 8s in row7 of the test case would propagate as 16s, but the training examples don't have such cases. However, the pattern seems to require this.\n\nBut wait, in Example1's input, the bottom row has a 3, which propagates as 3. The row above has 8s. The output's rows above have 3s. So even though the multiplier is 1 (row_from_bottom 0), the value is 3*1=3.\n\nTherefore, the test case's 8s in row7 (row_from_bottom 1) would propagate as 16s. This should be correct.\n\nHowever, the training examples use only integers that are factors of the original values. For example, in Example3, 2 becomes 4 (2*2). So the test case's 8s become 16 (8*2). \n\nTherefore, the final answer should be as above, with the 16s and other values.",

        "cot_2": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. So, looking at the training examples, each input is a 2D array, and the output seems to be a modified version of it. Let me see what's changing between the input and output.\n\nStarting with Example 0. The input is a 3x3 grid. The output has [4, 0, 4] as the first row, the middle row stays [0,2,0], and the third row is the same as the input. Hmm. So maybe some numbers are being added above certain elements. Let's see the input's third row is [2,4,2], and the output's first row has 4s where the third row has 2s? Wait, maybe it's looking at the non-zero elements in the bottom rows and propagating some values upwards.\n\nIn Example 1, the input has a 5x5 grid. The bottom two rows have 8s and a 3. The output has 3s appearing in the rows above. For instance, the third row from the bottom (row index 2) has 1s in the first and last positions. Wait, maybe each non-zero element in a lower row causes a value to be placed in the row above, shifted left and right? Like, the 3 in the bottom center (row 4, column 2) might be causing the 3s in the rows above, but spread outwards?\n\nLooking at Example 2's input: the bottom rows have 6s and 1s. The output has 1s appearing two rows above. So maybe the pattern is that for each non-zero number in a row, the row above (maybe a certain distance up) gets a value, perhaps the same as the number below but moving outward. Like, each element creates a copy diagonally upwards. But how?\n\nAnother approach: Let's look for how the outputs are generated. For example, in Example 0, the bottom row has 2,4,2. The output's first row has 4s where the bottom row has 2s, but the middle is 0. Wait, maybe the 4 is the sum of adjacent elements? Or perhaps the value is being taken from the row below but offset.\n\nWait, perhaps each non-zero element in a row causes a copy of its value to be placed in the row above, but mirrored. For example, in Example 1, the bottom row has 3 in the center. The row above it (row 3) has 8, but the output for row 3 is [0,0,8,0,0], which is same as input. Then row 2 (third from bottom) in output has [0,3,0,3,0]. So the 3 in the center of row 4 causes two 3s to appear in row 2, columns 1 and 3 (if zero-based). Then row 1 (fourth from bottom) in output has [3,0,0,0,3]. So the 3s are moving outward each time. So each non-zero element in a row propagates its value upwards, each time moving left and right by one column per row up. So for a non-zero element at (row, col), the row above (row-1) would have copies at col-1 and col+1. But if those positions are zero, they get filled. But how does this work for multiple layers?\n\nWait, in Example 1, the 3 is in row 4 (0-based: row 4 is the last row). Then in the output, row 3 (original input's row 3) has [0,0,8,0,0], which is same as input. The row above that (row 2 in output) has 3s at positions 1 and 3. Then row 1 has 3s at 0 and 4. So that's two rows above the original 3. So perhaps each non-zero element in a row affects the rows two levels up. Wait, but the 3 is in row 4 (assuming rows are numbered from top as 0), but in the output, the 3s start appearing in row 2 (third row from top). Wait, maybe the rows are being processed from bottom to top, and each non-zero element propagates upwards in a certain pattern.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each layer (starting from the bottom) is causing a diamond-shaped pattern above. For example, the non-zero elements in the bottom layer (row N) create a diamond shape in the rows above. The value of the element is copied in such a way that each level up, the copies spread one step left and right. So, for a single element, it would create a diamond pattern. But when multiple elements are present, maybe they combine.\n\nLooking at Example 3: the input's bottom rows have 2s and 4s. The output has 4s appearing in rows above. For instance, the 4s in the fourth row (from the top) in output. Let me check the input's bottom row is [2,2,4,4,4,2,2]. The row above that in input has [0,0,2,2,2,0,0]. The output's fourth row (third from bottom) is [4,0,0,0,0,0,4], which is two rows above the original 4s. So maybe each element in a lower row adds its value to a higher row, offset by the number of rows above. For example, the 4 in the bottom row (row 6) would influence row 4 (two rows up) by placing 4s two columns to the left and right. So if the 4 is at position (6,2), then two rows up (row 4) at positions 0 and 4. Wait, but in the output, row 4 has 4s at positions 1 and 5 (assuming 0-based). Hmm, maybe the number of rows above determines the spread. For example, an element in row N (bottom row) affects row N-2, with a spread of (N-2) - current row? Not sure.\n\nWait, let's take Example 0 again. The input's bottom row is [2,4,2]. The output's first row is [4,0,4]. The 2s in the bottom row (positions 0 and 2) become 4s in the first row. The middle 4 becomes 0 in the first row. So maybe each non-zero element in the bottom row is being multiplied by 2 and placed two rows up? Because in Example 0, the bottom row is row 2 (0-based), and the first row is row 0. The 2s in row 2 become 4s in row 0. So the distance is two rows. So for each element in the bottom row, you multiply by 2 and place it two rows up. But then why in Example 1, the 3 in row 4 (bottom row) is causing 3s to appear in row 2 and row 1. Wait, the 3 is in the bottom row (row 4). The output's row 2 (third from bottom) has 3s, and row 1 (fourth from bottom) has 3s. So the distance from row 4 to row 2 is 2 rows, and from 4 to row 1 is 3 rows. But in that case, the 3s are placed at 2 rows up (row 2) with a spread of 1 column left and right, then 3 rows up (row 1) with spread of 2 columns left and right.\n\nAlternatively, maybe for each non-zero element in a row, you add that value to the row that is (element's row - 2) and positions shifted left and right by (element's row - current row). Wait, perhaps the rule is that for every non-zero element in a row, you add that element's value to the row that is two levels above it, but shifted left and right by the number of levels up. Wait, that's a bit abstract.\n\nLet me think of another approach. Let's list all the transformations for each example and see if there's a common rule.\n\nIn Example 0:\n\nOriginal bottom row (row 2): [2,4,2].\n\nOutput's top row (row 0): [4,0,4].\n\nSo the 2s became 4s (doubled) and placed in row 0. The 4 in the middle became 0. So perhaps, when the element is even, it's doubled and placed two rows up. But why the middle 4 becomes 0?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the non-zero elements in the bottom row are being copied two rows up, but mirrored, and summed if there are overlaps. For example, the 2 in position 0 of row 2 would go to position 0 in row 0. The 2 in position 2 of row 2 would go to position 2 of row 0. But they are added? So 2 + 2 =4? Wait, but there's only two 2s. Wait, the output row 0 has 4,0,4. So the middle is 0. So maybe each element in the bottom row is mirrored to the top row, with their values summed. So the left and right elements are summed into the top row. For example, in row 2 of input, positions 0 and 2 are 2 each. Their sum is 4, placed in positions 0 and 2 of row 0. The middle element (4) isn't mirrored, so it's zero. Hmm, that might make sense. But how does this apply to other examples.\n\nTake Example 1. The bottom row (row 4) has [8,8,3,8,8]. The 3 is in position 2. Then in the output, row 2 (third from bottom) has 3s at positions 1 and 3. Then row 1 has 3s at 0 and 4. So it's like the 3 is being mirrored each time you go up a row. So in row 4, the 3 is at position 2. Then in row 3, same as input. Then in row 2, positions 1 and 3. Then row 1, positions 0 and 4. So each step up, the positions spread left and right. And the value is the same as the original 3. So the 3 is propagated upwards in a diamond shape.\n\nBut in the output for Example 1, the row 3 (original input row 3) has [0,0,8,0,0], which is same as input. So the 8s in row 4 (positions 0,1,3,4) are 8s, but in the output's row 3, the 8 is only at position 2. Wait, the input's row 3 is [0,0,8,0,0]. So perhaps the 8 in row 3's position 2 is part of the original input and remains. But the 8s in the bottom row (row 4) are 8s in positions 0,1,3,4, which maybe are mirrored upwards. Wait, but in the output for row 2 (third from bottom), we see 3s but not 8s. So maybe only certain numbers are being mirrored upwards. Or perhaps different numbers propagate differently.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is that any non-zero number in a row propagates upwards in a diamond pattern, but the starting point depends on the row. For example, elements in the bottom row (row N) start propagating two rows up (N-2), and each subsequent row upwards increases the spread. Alternatively, the number of rows up determines how far left and right the copies are.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the propagation is such that for each element, you look two rows above and place copies in positions shifted left and right by the distance (rows up). So for example, an element in row 4 (0-based) would place copies in row 2 (two rows up) at columns col-2 and col+2. But in Example 1, the 3 in row4, col2 would then be placed in row2, col0 and col4. But in the example, row2 of the output has 3s at cols 1 and 3. Hmm, that doesn't match. Alternatively, perhaps the spread is one per row up. So two rows up would spread two steps left and right. Wait, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, let's think of each non-zero number as a \"source\" that emits its value upwards in a V shape. For each row above, the value is placed one column left and right. For example, a source at (row, col) would place its value at (row-1, col-1) and (row-1, col+1). Then for each of those positions, they would emit to (row-2, col-2) and (row-2, col), etc. But that could create a diamond pattern.\n\nLooking at Example1's 3 in row4, col2. So in row3, col1 and 3 (but the original input's row3 is 0,0,8,0,0). Then in the output, row3 has 8 in col2 (original) and others 0. Then in row2 of the output, they place 3s in col1 and 3. So maybe the 3 from row4 propagates to row3 (col1 and 3), but since those positions in row3 were 0, they get the 3. But the output's row3 is [0,0,8,0,0], which suggests that the original 8 in row3, col2 is preserved, and the 3's propagation into row3 isn't happening. Wait, this is confusing.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the propagation skips a row. For example, the source in row4 propagates to row2, and then row0. Each time, moving two rows up. So in row4, the 3 would go to row2 (two up), then row0 (two up from row2). But in Example1, the 3 is in row4, so two rows up is row2. Then in row2, it's placed at col1 and 3. Then from row2, two rows up is row0. But the output for Example1's row0 is [0,0,0,0,0], so maybe the propagation stops after a certain point. Or maybe it's propagating one row up each time but not skipping.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the pattern is that for each non-zero element in row r, column c, we place copies of its value in row r-1, columns c-1 and c+1. Then for those copies, in row r-2, columns c-2 and c+2, etc. So each level up, the spread increases by one. This would create a diamond pattern. Let's test this with Example1.\n\nOriginal 3 is in row4, column2 (assuming rows are 0-based from top). So row3 would have 3s at columns1 and3. Then row2 would have 3s at columns0 and4. Then row1 would have no positions (since columns-1 and5 are out of bounds). So the output's row3 would have 3s at columns1 and3. But in the actual output, row3 (third from bottom) is [0,0,8,0,0], which is same as input. So this contradicts, unless the original values take precedence. Wait, perhaps the propagation only happens in rows where the original value was zero. So if a position in a higher row is already non-zero, it remains as is. Otherwise, the propagated value is added.\n\nIn Example1's input, row3 (third from bottom) is [0,0,8,0,0]. So the 8 is present. The propagated 3s from the row below would be in columns1 and3 of row3. But since those positions are 0 in the original input, they would become 3s. But the output for row3 is [0,0,8,0,0], which suggests that the 3s aren't placed there. So this theory is incorrect.\n\nHmm. Let's think of another approach. Maybe the pattern is that each non-zero number in a row propagates upwards to the row that is (current row -2), and the columns are shifted by (current row - target row). For example, if a number is in row r, column c, then it affects row r-2, columns c- (r - (r-2)) )? Not sure.\n\nWait, looking at Example3's input and output:\n\nInput's bottom two rows are:\n\n[0,0,2,2,2,0,0]\n\n[2,2,4,4,4,2,2]\n\nOutput's rows:\n\nRow4 (from top): [0,4,0,0,0,4,0]\n\nRow3 (from top): [4,0,0,0,0,0,4]\n\nSo the 4s in the bottom row (row6, columns2,3,4) are 4s. The output's row4 (two rows up) has 4s in columns1 and5. And row3 has 4s in columns0 and6. So each 4 in the bottom row (row6) is being propagated two rows up (row4) but shifted left and right by 2 columns (since row6 to row4 is two rows up, so shift by 2 columns). Then row4's 4s are propagated two more rows up (row2) shifted by another 2 columns, but in the example's output, row2 is [0,0,0,0,0,0,0], so maybe those positions are out of bounds. Alternatively, perhaps each element is moved up by two rows and shifted left and right by one column per row up. Wait, for example, a 4 in row6, column2. Moving up two rows would be row4. The shift could be (row difference) = 2, so shift left and right by 2 columns. So column2 -2=0, column2+2=4. But in the output's row4, we have 4s at columns1 and5. Hmm, that doesn't fit. So perhaps the shift is (rows up) * something.\n\nAlternatively, the shift could be the number of rows moved up. For example, moving up two rows: shift left and right by two columns. Wait, in Example3, the bottom row is row6 (0-based). The 4s in row6, columns2,3,4. Let's take the leftmost 4 at column2. Moving up two rows to row4. Shift left by 2: column0. Shift right by2: column4. But in the output's row4, the 4s are at columns1 and5. Hmm, that's not matching. Alternatively, maybe the shift is by (rows up) -1. For example, two rows up would shift left and right by 1. So column2 becomes 1 and3. But in row4 of the output, the 4s are at columns1 and5. So maybe each 4 in row6, columns2,3,4 contribute to row4. For example, the 4 at column2 in row6 would shift to column0 and4 (two rows up, shift \u00b12?), but then overlapping with others.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the pattern is to take the values from the lower rows and spread them upwards in a pyramid-like shape. For each non-zero value, create a line above that fans out left and right by one each level. But the starting point seems to vary based on the example.\n\nLet me try to look for a pattern in all examples.\n\nExample0:\n\nInput row2: [2,4,2]\n\nOutput row0: [4,0,4]\n\nThe 2s in the bottom row (row2) are summed (2+2) to 4, placed in row0. Middle 4 becomes 0.\n\nExample1:\n\nInput row4: [8,8,3,8,8]\n\nOutput rows:\n\nRow2: [0,3,0,3,0]\n\nRow1: [3,0,0,0,3]\n\nSo the 3 in row4, col2 is propagating upwards. In row2 (two rows up), 3s at cols1 and3. In row1 (three rows up), 3s at cols0 and4. So for each level up, the positions spread by one left and right.\n\nSimilarly, the 8s in row4, cols0,1,3,4. But in the output, row3 (original input row3) has [0,0,8,0,0], which is same as input. So perhaps the 8s in row4 don't propagate upwards. So maybe only certain numbers (like 3, 4, 1 in other examples) are propagated, while others (like 2,8,6) are not? But in Example0, the 2s are propagated. So that's conflicting.\n\nWait, in Example0's output, the 2s in the bottom row become 4s in the top row. So perhaps even numbers are being doubled and placed two rows up. But in Example3, the 4s in the bottom row are propagated as 4s two rows up. Wait, in Example3's input, the bottom row has 4s. The output's row4 (two up) has 4s. So 4s are propagated as 4s, not doubled. Hmm, that complicates things.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the value is preserved, but the position is shifted based on the distance from the bottom. For example, each non-zero number in row r is placed in row (r - 2k) where k is a positive integer, such that r-2k >=0. The position shifts by k columns left and right. For example, in Example1, the 3 is in row4. For k=1, r-2k=2. So row2, columns 2-1=1 and 2+1=3. Then k=2: r-4=0, columns 2-2=0 and 2+2=4. So in row0, columns0 and4. But the output's row0 is all zeros. So this doesn't fit. So maybe k can't be 2 here. Or maybe the propagation stops after one step.\n\nAlternatively, the pattern is that each non-zero number in a row propagates to the row two levels above, shifted left and right by the number of steps equal to the level. For example, level 1 (two rows up) shifts by one step, level 2 (four rows up) shifts by two steps, etc. But this isn't matching the examples.\n\nAnother observation: in the output, the modified rows are those above the non-zero rows in the input. And the propagation seems to happen in a way that creates a diamond shape. For Example1, the 3 in the bottom leads to a diamond of 3s. In Example0, the two 2s in the bottom row become 4s in the top row, forming a diamond with two elements.\n\nWait, maybe the pattern is that for each non-zero element in the input, you add its value to the positions two rows up and shifted left and right by one. So if there's a 3 in row4, col2, you add 3 to row2, col1 and row2, col3. Then for those positions, you add the same value two rows up again (row0, col0 and row0, col2 for row2, col1; row0, col2 and row0, col4 for row2, col3). But in Example1's output, row0 is all zeros, so maybe the propagation stops after one step. Or perhaps the propagation is only one step.\n\nBut in Example0, the 2s in row2 (bottom) propagate to row0, cols0 and 2. That's two rows up. So the shift is zero columns? Or perhaps the shift is the number of rows up divided by 2. For two rows up, shift by 1 column left and right.\n\nWait, in Example0, the bottom row is row2 (0-based). The top row is row0. The distance is two rows. So shifting left and right by two columns? But in Example0, the columns for the 2s are 0 and 2. Shifting two columns would be out of bounds, so perhaps the shift is (rows up) // 2. For two rows up, shift by 1. So in Example0, the 2s in row2, cols0 and 2 would propagate to row0, cols0-1=-1 (invalid) and 0+1=1. But the output's row0 is [4,0,4]. Hmm, this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each non-zero element in row r contributes to the row r-2 by adding its value to the same column, but only if r-2 >=0. Then the middle element in Example0's row2 (which is 4) would contribute to row0, column1, but row0's column1 is 0. But in Example0's output, row0's column1 is 0. So that doesn't explain the 4s.\n\nWait, maybe it's a combination of elements. For Example0, the bottom row has 2,4,2. The sum of the left and right elements (2+2=4) is placed in the top row's left and right columns. The middle element (4) is ignored. So perhaps the rule is that for each row, the leftmost and rightmost non-zero elements are summed and placed two rows above. But that's not consistent with other examples.\n\nIn Example1, the bottom row has 8,8,3,8,8. The leftmost and rightmost are 8s. If summed, 8+8=16, but the output's row2 (two up) has 3s. So that doesn't fit. So this theory is wrong.\n\nAnother angle: The output seems to have the same structure as the input, but with new values added in higher rows. The new values are copies of certain elements from lower rows, placed in a pattern that spreads out as you go up. For example, in Example1, the 3 in the bottom row leads to 3s in higher rows. The same happens in Example3 with the 4s.\n\nSo perhaps the rule is: For each non-zero number in a row, starting from the bottom, if the number is not part of the \"base\" structure (like the bottom-most non-zero rows), then it is propagated upwards in a diamond pattern. The \"base\" is the lowest rows with non-zero elements, and any number above that is part of the propagation.\n\nAlternatively, the pattern is to look for the lowest non-zero row, then for each non-zero element in that row, create a diamond pattern upwards, where each level up spreads the value one column left and right. Then for each subsequent higher row, the same is done for their non-zero elements.\n\nBut how to determine which elements are part of the base. For example, in Example1, the lowest non-zero rows are row4 and row3. Row4 has non-zero elements, and row3 has a single 8. So maybe the base is the lowest two rows, and any elements there are propagated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the propagation starts from the bottom-most non-zero row and propagates upwards every two rows. Let's see:\n\nIn Example0, the bottom row is row2. The propagation is to row0. That's two rows up.\n\nIn Example1, the bottom row is row4. Propagation to row2 (two up), then to row0 (but output row0 is zeros). But the output shows 3s in row2 and row1. Hmm, maybe my initial assumption is incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, the pattern is that each non-zero element in a row r creates a diamond pattern starting two rows up, spreading left and right by one column per row. For example:\n\nElement at (r, c) adds to:\n\n- (r-1, c-1) and (r-1, c+1)\n\n- (r-2, c-2) and (r-2, c+2)\n\nAnd so on until out of bounds.\n\nBut how does this fit with the examples?\n\nExample0's 2s in row2, columns0 and2:\n\nFor (2,0):\n\n- (1,-1) invalid and (1,1)\n\n- (0,-2) invalid and (0,2)\n\nSo in row0, column2 gets 2.\n\nSimilarly, (2,2) would propagate to (1,3) invalid, and (0,0) and (0,4) invalid.\n\nBut the output's row0 is [4,0,4]. So maybe overlapping propagations sum their values. For example, the 2s at (2,0) and (2,2) both contribute to row0, columns0 and2. Wait, (2,0) would propagate to row0, column0 (since r-2=0, c-2=0-2= -2 invalid, c+2=0+2=2. So row0, column2 gets 2. Similarly, (2,2) would propagate to row0, column0 (2-2=0) and column4 (invalid). So row0, column0 gets 2 and column2 gets 2. Summing, row0 would be [2,0,2], but the output is [4,0,4]. So maybe each element is doubled. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, the value is added as is. But if two sources contribute to the same cell, they sum. So for Example0's row0, column0 would get 2 (from row2, column0) and column2 would get 2 (from row2, column0) and another 2 (from row2, column2), totaling 4. But how? Because row2, column0 would propagate to row0, column0-2= -2 (invalid) and 0+2=2. So column2. Similarly, row2, column2 would propagate to row0, column0 and 4 (invalid). So row0, column0 gets 2 (from column2) and column0 gets 2 from row2, column2's left propagation. So sum 4. Column2 gets 2 from row2, column0 and 2 from row2, column2's right propagation? No, this is getting confusing.\n\nAlternatively, the propagation is such that for each non-zero element in row r, column c, the element is added to the cells in row r-2, columns c-1 and c+1. Then, for those added cells, the same process is repeated: they are treated as new sources and propagate to row (r-2)-2 = r-4, columns (c-1)-1 and (c-1)+1, and (c+1)-1 and (c+1)+1, etc.\n\nFor Example0:\n\nRow2, columns0 and2 (values 2 each).\n\nPropagate to row0, columns0-1= -1 (invalid) and 0+1=1 (for column0 in row2). Wait, this approach isn't clear.\n\nAnother Idea: Let's look for the maximum row in the input that has non-zero elements. The propagation starts from that row and moves up. For each non-zero element in the max row, we place copies of its value in the row two above it, shifted left and right by one. Then, in that new row, for each copy, we again place copies two rows above, shifted left and right by one more. This creates a diamond pattern.\n\nFor Example1:\n\nMax row is 4 (0-based). Non-zero element 3 at column2.\n\n- Place in row2 (4-2=2), columns2-1=1 and2+1=3. So row2, cols1 and3 get 3.\n\n- Then from row2, cols1 and3, place in row0 (2-2=0), cols0 and2 (for col1), and cols2 and4 (for col3). So row0 would have 3s at cols0,2,4. But the output's row0 is all zeros, so maybe this propagation stops after one step. Or perhaps the propagation only happens once.\n\nBut in Example1's output, row1 has 3s at cols0 and4, which suggests that after the first propagation to row2, there's another step to row0 and row1? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the first propagation is two rows up, then the next is one row up from there. So:\n\nFrom row4, propagate to row2 (two up), then from row2, propagate to row1 (one up), which would be inconsistent. But in Example1's output, row1 has 3s at cols0 and4, which would require a spread of two from row2's cols1 and3. So if row2 has 3s at1 and3, then row1 (one up) would have 3s at0 and2 from col1, and 2 and4 from col3. So overlapping at col2. But in the output, row1 has 3s at0 and4. So maybe only the leftmost and rightmost positions are taken.\n\nAlternatively, the propagation from row2's 3s to row1 would be one row up, shifted left and right by 1. So row1's 3s would be at0 (1-1) and2 (1+1) for the col1 in row2. And 2 (3-1) and4 (3+1) for the col3 in row2. So row1 would have 3s at0,2,4. But in the output, it's [3,0,0,0,3], which is cols0 and4. So perhaps overlapping values are summed, but in this case, 3+3=6. But the output shows 3. So this doesn't fit.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Let's try to look for a pattern in how the outputs are structured.\n\nIn all examples, the output seems to have the same lower rows as the input, with modifications only to the upper rows. For example:\n\n- Example0: the output has the same middle and bottom rows, but the top row is modified.\n\n- Example1: the output's bottom two rows are same as input. The rows above are modified.\n\n- Example2: same as above.\n\n- Example3: the bottom two rows are same as input, and the rows above are modified.\n\nSo the rule might be that the lowest two rows are kept as is, and the rows above are modified based on the lower rows.\n\nBut in Example0, the input's middle row is [0,2,0], which is kept in the output. The bottom row is [2,4,2], also kept. The top row is modified.\n\nIn Example1, the bottom two rows are [8,8,3,8,8] and [0,0,8,0,0]. In the output, they are unchanged. The rows above are modified.\n\nSo the pattern is: preserve the bottom two rows, and for each non-zero element in the third row from the bottom, propagate its value upwards in a diamond pattern.\n\nWait, in Example1's input, the third row from the bottom (row3) is [0,0,8,0,0]. The output's row3 is same. The fourth row from the bottom (row2) is modified. So perhaps the propagation starts from the third row from the bottom. But how?\n\nAlternatively, the propagation starts from the bottom row and moves up, but the lower two rows are preserved, and the propagation affects the rows above them.\n\nBut in Example1, the bottom row's 3 is being propagated. So perhaps the propagation starts from the bottom row, and the rows above are modified, except the bottom two rows.\n\nAnother Idea: For each non-zero element in row r, column c, if r is the bottom row or the row just above the bottom, then propagate the value upwards in such a way that each step up, the value is placed one column left and right. This would create a diamond pattern.\n\nFor Example1:\n\n- The 3 is in the bottom row (r=4). So propagating up:\n\n- r=3: columns1 and3.\n\n- r=2: columns0 and2 and 2 and4.\n\nBut in the output, r=2 has 3s at1 and3, and r=1 has 3s at0 and4. So this matches. So each time you go up a row, you shift left and right by one. But why aren't the 3s in r=3 visible in the output? Because the original input's r=3 (third row from bottom) has an 8 in column2. So maybe the propagation only happens if the target cell is zero. So the original values take precedence.\n\nIn Example1's output, the third row from the bottom (r=3) is [0,0,8,0,0], same as input. So even though the propagation from the bottom row's 3 would place 3s in r=3, columns1 and3, but since those cells are zero in the input, they are set to 3. But in the example, they remain zero. So this contradicts.\n\nHmm. This is getting tricky. Let me think differently. Perhaps the numbers in the output's upper rows are derived by adding the numbers from the lower rows, but with certain rules. For instance, each cell in the upper rows is the sum of the two cells diagonally below it from two rows down. For example, cell (i,j) = cell (i+2, j-1) + cell (i+2, j+1). But let's test this.\n\nExample0's row0:\n\nCell (0,0) would be (2, -1) which is invalid, so 0. But the output's (0,0) is4. So this doesn't work.\n\nAnother Idea: For each cell in the output, if it's in row i, then its value is the sum of the cells in row i+2, columns j-1 and j+1, if those exist. If not, zero. But for Example0's row0:\n\nCell (0,0) would be row2, columns-1 (invalid) and1. Sum of 0 (since row2, column1 is4). But output is4. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, sum of row i+2, j-1 and j+1. For (0,0), j-1 is invalid, so 0. j+1 is column1, which is4. Sum is0+4=4. Which matches the output. For (0,2), j-1=1 (4), j+1=3 (invalid). Sum 4+0=4. So output row0 would be [4,0,4], which matches. For the middle cell (0,1), sum of row2,0 and2 (2 and2) which sum to4. But output has 0. So this doesn't fit. So maybe only certain columns are considered.\n\nAlternatively, sum of the two cells two rows below and one column to the left and right. So for cell (i,j), it's cell (i+2, j-1) + cell (i+2, j+1). For Example0's row0, cell (0,0) is 2 (row2, j-1= -1 \u21920) +2 (row2, j+1=1 \u21924). Wait, this is confusing.\n\nWait, in Example0, the bottom row (row2) is [2,4,2]. So for row0, cell (0,0) would be the sum of row2's cell (2, -1) [invalid, 0] and cell (2,1) [4]. Sum is4. But the output is4, which matches. Cell (0,1) is sum of row2's cell (2,0) [2] and cell (2,2) [2]. Sum is4. But output has0. So this doesn't fit. Hmm.\n\nThis approach seems to work for the corners but not the middle. So maybe there's a different rule for even and odd rows or columns. Not sure.\n\nAnother Idea: Looking at Example3's output. The bottom two rows are the same as input. The row above that (row4 from top) has 4s at columns1 and5. The next row up (row3) has 4s at columns0 and6. This seems like each 4 in the bottom row (row6) is being moved up two rows and shifted left and right by two columns. For example, the 4s in row6, columns2,3,4 are propagated to row4, columns0,2,4,6 (but output has 4s at1 and5). Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each element in the bottom row is being copied to the row two above it, shifted left and right by one, but merged with other copies. For example, the 4s in row6, columns2,3,4 would each propagate to row4, columns1-3,2-4,3-5. But when overlapped, they sum. So three 4s would create 4s in columns1,2,3,4,5. But in the output, row4 has 4s at1 and5. So this doesn't fit.\n\nI'm stuck. Let's look for a different pattern. Maybe the output's upper rows are formed by taking the non-zero elements from the lower rows and moving them upwards in a way that forms a diamond, but only for the numbers that are not part of the base.\n\nIn Example0, the base is the bottom row with 2s and 4. The 2s are moved up two rows, but combined into 4s. So perhaps each pair of 2s in the same row sum to 4 and are placed two rows up. But how?\n\nIn Example0's bottom row, the two 2s are at the ends. They sum to4, placed in the top row's ends. The middle 4 is ignored. So the rule might be to sum the left and right elements in the bottom row and place them in the top row.\n\nBut in Example1, the bottom row has 8,8,3,8,8. The sum of left and right 8s would be 16, but the output's top rows don't have 16. So this theory is invalid.\n\nAnother Idea: The output for each example has certain numbers appearing in the upper rows that match the numbers in the lower rows. For example, Example1's 3 in the bottom row appears as 3s in upper rows. Example3's 4s in the bottom row appear as 4s in upper rows. So maybe the value is preserved, and the position is determined by the distance from the bottom.\n\nSo for each non-zero element in the input's row r, column c, the output's row r-2k has copies at column c-k and c+k, where k is a positive integer such that r-2k >=0 and the columns are within bounds.\n\nFor example, in Example1, the 3 is at (4,2). For k=1, r-2=2, columns 2-1=1 and 2+1=3. So row2, columns1 and3 have 3s. For k=2, r-4=0, columns 2-2=0 and2+2=4. So row0, columns0 and4. But in the output, row0 is all zeros. So this is not matching. Unless k can only be 1.\n\nBut why then in Example3, the 4s are propagated two rows up (k=1) and then again two more rows (k=2)?\n\nIn Example3's input, the 4s are in row6 (assuming 0-based). For k=1, row4 (6-2=4), columns2-1=1 and2+1=3. But in the output's row4, 4s are at columns1 and5. Hmm, not matching.\n\nThis is really challenging. Let me look at all the examples again and try to find a common rule.\n\nExample0:\n\nInput:\nRow0: [0,0,0]\n\nRow1: [0,2,0]\n\nRow2: [2,4,2]\n\nOutput:\n\nRow0: [4,0,4]\n\nRow1: [0,2,0]\n\nRow2: [2,4,2]\n\nSo the changes are in row0. The 4s are in columns0 and2. The original row2 has 2s in those columns. So row0's values are double the row2's values in those columns. But why?\n\nExample1:\n\nInput's bottom row (row4) has 3. The output's row2 has 3s in columns1 and3. Row1 has 3s in columns0 and4. So each step up, the 3s spread out by one column each way.\n\nExample2:\n\nInput's bottom row (row4) has 1s. The output's row2 has 1s in columns0 and4. So that's two rows up, spread by two columns. Wait, row4 to row2 is two rows up. The 1s are in columns0 and4 of row2, which are two columns away from the original column2.\n\nExample3:\n\nInput's bottom row (row6) has 4s in columns2,3,4. Output's row4 (two up) has 4s in columns1 and5. Then row3 (three up) has 4s in columns0 and6. So each step up, the 4s spread out by one column each.\n\nSo the pattern seems to be:\n\nFor each non-zero element in row r, column c, it propagates upwards in a diamond pattern. For each level k (starting from 1), the element is placed in row r - k, column c - (k -1) and c + (k-1). Then, in the next level k+1, placed in row r - (k+1), column c - k and c +k. This creates a diamond shape.\n\nWait, for example, in Example1's 3 at row4, column2:\n\nk=1: row3, column2-0=2 and 2+0=2. But output row3 is same as input, which has an 8. So perhaps this isn't the case.\n\nAlternatively, the propagation starts at two rows up. For each non-zero element in row r, it propagates to row r-2, columns c-1 and c+1. Then from there, propagate to row (r-2)-2= r-4, columns (c-1)-1 and (c+1)+1, and so on.\n\nIn Example1's 3 at row4, column2:\n\n- First propagation: row4-2=2, columns2-1=1 and2+1=3. So row2, columns1 and3 (matches output).\n\n- Then row2-2=0, columns1-1=0 and3+1=4. So row0, columns0 and4. But output row0 is zeros, so maybe this step is not happening.\n\nBut in Example3's 4 at row6, column2:\n\n- First propagation: row4, columns1 and3. But output row4 has 4s at columns1 and5. Hmm, this doesn't match. So maybe the direction is different.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for each non-zero element in row r, the copies are placed in row r-1, columns c-1 and c+1. Then, for each of those copies, placed in row (r-1)-1 = r-2, columns (c-1)-1 and (c+1)+1. So a pyramid-like pattern.\n\nFor Example1's 3 at row4, column2:\n\n- row3, columns1 and3. But input's row3 has an 8 in column2. But in the output, row3 is same as input. So this suggests that the original values are preserved and new values are added only to zero cells.\n\nBut in Example1's output, row2 has 3s added to columns1 and3. So perhaps the propagation happens, but only if the target cell is zero. So the 3s are added to row2's columns1 and3 because those were zero in the input.\n\nSimilarly, in Example0's input, row0 is all zeros, so the propagated values are added. \n\nSo the rule could be:\n\nFor each non-zero element v in row r, column c:\n\nFor each k >=1:\n\n- In row r - k, place v in columns c - (k-1) and c + (k-1), but only if the target cell is zero in the original input.\n\nBut in Example1's row3, columns1 and3 were zero in the input, so they would be filled with 3s. But the output's row3 is same as input. So this contradicts.\n\nThis is really perplexing. Maybe there's a different approach. Let's think of the output as being built from the bottom up. The bottom two rows are the same as the input. Then, each row above is filled based on the row two below it. For example, each cell in row i is the sum or some function of the cells two rows below, in columns to the left and right.\n\nFor Example0's row0: it's based on row2. The cells in row0, j are the sum of row2's j-1 and j+1. For j=0: sum of row2's j-1 (invalid, 0) and j+1 (4). So 4. For j=2: sum of row2's j-1 (4) and j+1 (invalid), so4. For j=1: sum of 2 and2 (from j-1=0 and j+1=2) \u21924. But output is0. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's the sum of the two cells two rows below and one column left and right. For row0, j=0: row2, j-1 is invalid and j+1=1 (4). So sum is4. j=2: row2, j-1=1 (4) and j+1=3 invalid. Sum is4. j=1: row2, j-1=0 (2) and j+1=2 (2). Sum is4. But output's j=1 is0. So this doesn't fit.\n\nThis is leading me nowhere. Let's think of the test input and see if I can find a pattern that fits all examples and then apply it.\n\nTest Input:\n\nA 9x9 grid. The bottom two rows are:\n\nRow7: [0,0,0,8,8,8,0,0,0]\n\nRow8: [8,8,8,2,2,2,8,8,8]\n\nAccording to the examples, the bottom two rows are preserved. The output's lower two rows would be the same as input. The rows above would have new values based on the lower rows.\n\nLooking at the examples, the new values are derived from certain elements in the lower rows. In Example3, the 4s in the bottom row propagate upwards in a diamond pattern. The 2s in the bottom row of the test input might propagate similarly. The 8s might also propagate, but in previous examples, like Example1, the 8s in the bottom row didn't propagate upwards. So perhaps only certain numbers are propagated, like the ones in the lowest non-zero rows. Or maybe all non-zero numbers are propagated, but the 8s are overwritten by other values.\n\nIn the test input's bottom two rows:\n\nRow8: [8,8,8,2,2,2,8,8,8]\n\nRow7: [0,0,0,8,8,8,0,0,0]\n\nSo the 8s in row7 and row8 might propagate upwards. The 2s in row8, columns3-5 might also propagate.\n\nIn Example3, the 4s in the bottom row propagated to two rows above as 4s. Similarly, the 2s here might propagate as 2s. The 8s might propagate as 8s.\n\nSo, applying the pattern from Example3, the 2s in row8 would propagate two rows up to row6, shifted left and right by one. For each 2 in row8, column3,4,5:\n\n- Column3: row6, columns2 and4.\n\n- Column4: row6, columns3 and5.\n\n- Column5: row6, columns4 and6.\n\nBut since there are multiple 2s, their propagations might overlap. For example, the 2 in column3 would contribute to columns2 and4. The 2 in column4 would contribute to3 and5. The 2 in column5 would contribute to4 and6. So row6 would have 2s in columns2,3,4,5,6. But each contribution would add 2, so overlapping areas would sum. For example, column4 would get 2 from column3 and 2 from column5, totaling4. But according to the examples, the propagated values are the same as the original, not summed. So perhaps overlapping values are just overwritten, not summed.\n\nBut in Example0, the two 2s in the bottom row contributed to the same positions in the top row, resulting in 4s. So there, the values were summed. So this suggests that overlapping values sum.\n\nBut in Example1, the 3 in the bottom row propagated to two positions in row2, which didn't sum with anything else. So perhaps when only one source contributes, the value is added, but when multiple sources contribute, they sum.\n\nIn the test input's row8, the 2s in columns3-5 would each propagate to row6, columns2-6. But let's see:\n\n- Each 2 in row8, column3: contributes to row6, columns2 and4.\n\n- Each 2 in row8, column4: contributes to row6, columns3 and5.\n\n- Each 2 in row8, column5: contributes to row6, columns4 and6.\n\nSo row6 would have:\n\n- Column2: 2\n\n- Column3: 2\n\n- Column4: 2+2=4\n\n- Column5: 2\n\n- Column6: 2\n\nBut according to Example3, when multiple 4s were present, the output had 4s in specific positions, not summed. But in Example0, two 2s summed to4. So the pattern seems to allow summing.\n\nBut in the test input, the 8s in row7 and row8 may also propagate. For example, the 8s in row7, columns3-5 (each 8) would propagate to row5, columns2-6. And the 8s in row8, columns0-2,6-8 would propagate to row6, columns-1 (invalid), etc.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Let's try to apply the pattern observed in the examples.\n\nIn the test input, the lowest non-zero rows are rows7 and8. So the output would preserve those two rows and modify the rows above.\n\nThe 2s in row8, columns3-5 would propagate upwards. Following Example3's pattern, each 2 in row8 would propagate two rows up (row6) and two columns to the left and right. For example:\n\nA 2 in row8, column3 would propagate to row6, column1 and5.\n\nWait, Example3's 4s in row6 (bottom row) propagated to row4 (two up) columns1 and5, then to row3 (three up) columns0 and6. So the shift is (row difference) columns. For each step of two rows up, shift left and right by one.\n\nWait, row6 (Example3's input) is the bottom row. The 4s in row6 propagate to row4 (two up) columns1 and5. Then from row4, propagate to row2 (two up) columns0 and6. So each time two rows up, and shift left and right by one.\n\nSo in the test input, the 2s in row8 (bottom row) would propagate two rows up to row6, columns3-1=2 and3+1=4. Similarly, the 2 in column4 would go to3 and5, and column5 to4 and6. So row6 would have 2s at columns2,3,4,5,6. But in Example3, overlapping values were preserved, not summed. So perhaps each 2 is placed, and overlaps are overwritten, but this doesn't explain Example0's summed 4s.\n\nAlternatively, each source element contributes to the target cells, and if multiple sources contribute to the same cell, their values are summed. So in row6, column3 would have 2 from row8, column3's right shift and row8, column4's left shift. So 2+2=4.\n\nBut this is speculative. Let's proceed with this assumption.\n\nSo in the test input's row8:\n\n- 8s in columns0,1,2,6,7,8: each would propagate two rows up to row6. For example, 8 in column0 would propagate to row6, column-1 (invalid) and1. 8 in column1 propagates to0 and2. 8 in column2 propagates to1 and3. Similarly for columns6-8.\n\nBut the valid columns for row6 would be 0-8. So:\n\n- 8 in column0: row6, column1.\n\n- 8 in column1: row6,0 and2.\n\n- 8 in column2: row6,1 and3.\n\n- 8 in column6: row6,5 and7.\n\n- 8 in column7: row6,6 and8.\n\n- 8 in column8: row6,7 and9 (invalid).\n\nSo row6 would have 8s in columns0,1,2,3,5,6,7,8.\n\nBut also, the 2s in row8, columns3-5 would contribute:\n\n- 2 in column3: row6,2 and4.\n\n- 2 in column4: row6,3 and5.\n\n- 2 in column5: row6,4 and6.\n\nSo row6 would have:\n\n- 8s from row8's 8s and 2s from row8's 2s.\n\nBut the 2s and 8s may overlap. For example, row6, column3 would have 8 from row8, column2's right shift and 2 from row8, column3's left shift. So sum 8+2=10. But examples don't show summed values. Alternatively, the latest source overwrites.\n\nBut this is getting too complicated. Given the time I've spent and not finding a clear pattern, I'll make an educated guess based on the examples.\n\nIn the test input, the bottom two rows are preserved. The rows above are modified by propagating the non-zero elements upwards in a diamond pattern. The 8s in row7 and row8 would create diamond patterns, and the 2s in row8 would create their own.\n\nFor the 2s in row8, columns3-5, they would propagate two rows up to row6, columns2,4,6. Then two more rows up to row4, columns0,2,4,6,8. Then row2, columns-2 (invalid), etc.\n\nBut looking at Example3's 4s, which propagated two rows up, then two more rows up. So for the 2s in the test input's row8:\n\n- In row6 (two up), columns2,4,6.\n\n- In row4 (four up), columns0,4,8.\n\n- In row2 (six up), columns-2 (invalid) and 8 (invalid).\n\nSo row6 would have 2s at 2,4,6. Row4 would have 2s at 0,4,8.\n\nBut the test input's row7 also has 8s in columns3-5. These would propagate two rows up to row5, columns2-6. Then row3, columns0-8.\n\nBut given the complexity, I'll try to construct the output for the test input based on the examples' patterns.\n\nIn the test input's output, the bottom two rows are same as input. Then, the rows above are filled with propagated values.\n\nFor the 2s in row8, columns3-5:\n\n- Two rows up (row6), they would appear at columns2,4,6 (each 2 shifted left and right by 1 from their original columns).\n\n- Then two rows up from row6 (row4), the 2s would appear at columns0,4,8 (shifted left and right by 2 from original columns).\n\n- Then two rows up from row4 (row2), columns-2 (invalid), 2,6, 10 (invalid). So only columns2 and6.\n\nBut perhaps only the first propagation step is done, similar to Example3, where the 4s propagated two rows up and then two more. But in Example3's output, row4 and row3 have 4s. So maybe multiple propagations are allowed.\n\nFor the 2s in the test input:\n\n- Row6: columns2,4,6.\n\n- Row4: columns0,4,8.\n\n- Row2: columns2,6.\n\n- Row0: columns0,8.\n\nFor the 8s in row8:\n\n- Columns0,1,2,6,7,8.\n\nPropagating two rows up (row6):\n\n- Column0: row6, column1.\n\n- Column1: row6,0 and2.\n\n- Column2: row6,1 and3.\n\n- Column6: row6,5 and7.\n\n- Column7: row6,6 and8.\n\n- Column8: row6,7 and9 (invalid).\n\nSo row6 would have 8s at columns0,1,2,3,5,6,7,8.\n\nAdditionally, the 8s in row7, columns3-5:\n\n- Propagate two rows up to row5.\n\n- Column3: row5, columns2 and4.\n\n- Column4: row5,3 and5.\n\n- Column5: row5,4 and6.\n\nSo row5 would have 8s at columns2,3,4,5,6.\n\nPutting this all together:\n\nThe output would have:\n\n- Rows7 and8 as in input.\n\n- Row6: 8s in columns0,1,2,3,5,6,7,8 and 2s in 2,4,6. So overlapping cells would have both values. But since the examples show that the propagated values are added, and in Example0 the 2s summed to4, the overlapping cells here might sum. For example, column2 in row6 has 8 (from row8's column1) and 2 (from row8's column3). So 8+2=10. But examples don't show summation of different values. So perhaps the 2s and8s are placed in the same row but not summed. Or perhaps the latest value overwrites.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each propagation is done separately for each number. But the examples show that the same number is propagated. For example, Example3's 4s propagate as 4s. So maybe the 2s and8s are propagated separately, leading to overlapping cells having multiple values. But since the output format is a list of integers, overlaps must be resolved somehow.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and the need to provide an answer, I'll proceed with the following hypothesis:\n\nFor each non-zero element in the input's lowest two rows, propagate the value upwards in a diamond pattern, two rows up and shifted left and right by one column per row up, with overlapping values summing.\n\nFor the test input, the 2s in row8, columns3-5 would propagate to row6, columns2,4,6. The 8s in row8 and row7 would propagate to higher rows. But due to time constraints, I'll focus on the 2s and apply the pattern observed in Example3.\n\nIn Example3, the 4s in the bottom row (row6) propagated two rows up to row4 (columns1 and5), then two more rows up to row3 (columns0 and6).\n\nFollowing that pattern, the test input's 2s in row8 would propagate to row6, columns2,4,6. Then, from row6, propagate to row4, columns0,4,8. Then from row4, propagate to row2, columns-2 (invalid), 2,6, 10 (invalid), so columns2 and6. Then row0, columns0 and8.\n\nSo the output for the test input would have:\n\nRow6: [0,0,2,0,2,0,2,0,0]\n\nBut considering the 8s from row8's propagation, this might be more complex. However, given the examples' structure, I'll assume that only the 2s are propagated, and the 8s are part of the base and not propagated.\n\nThus, the output would have:\n\nRow6: [0,0,2,0,2,0,2,0,0]\n\nRow4: [2,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,2]\n\nRow2: [0,2,0,0,0,0,0,2,0]\n\nRow0: [2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2]\n\nBut this is just a guess based on Example3's pattern. The actual answer might look like this, with the 2s forming a diamond pattern."
