        "cot_1": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. So, the problem is to take these input arrays and produce output arrays based on some transformation. The inputs are lists of numbers, mostly 5s and 0s. The outputs are lists of three identical numbers, like [2,2,2], etc. \n\nLooking at the training examples, maybe each input array corresponds to one output array, but each output has three elements. Wait, the examples have four input arrays and three output arrays. Let me check. For example, in Example 0, the INPUT has four lines, and the OUTPUT has three lines. So maybe each output line is derived from comparing consecutive input lines? Or perhaps each output line is generated from a pair of input lines?\n\nLet me look at Example 0:\n\nINPUT:\n[5,5,5,5,0,5,5,5,5,0,5,5,5,5]\n[5,5,5,5,0,5,0,0,5,0,0,5,5,0]\n[5,5,5,5,0,5,0,0,5,0,0,5,5,0]\n[5,5,5,5,0,5,5,5,5,0,5,5,5,5]\n\nOUTPUT:\n[2,2,2]\n[8,8,8]\n[3,3,3]\n\nSo four input lines, three output lines. That suggests that each output line is generated from a pair of consecutive input lines. So the first output line comes from input lines 0 and 1, the second from lines 1 and 2, and the third from lines 2 and 3. Let's check that.\n\nIn Example 0, comparing the first two input lines:\n\nOriginal first line: [5,5,5,5,0,5,5,5,5,0,5,5,5,5]\nSecond line: [5,5,5,5,0,5,0,0,5,0,0,5,5,0]\n\nLooking for differences. The 0s are in positions where the first array has 5s? Let's see. Positions 6,7,9,10,13 in the second line are 0s where the first line had 5,5,0,5,5. Wait, maybe not. Alternatively, maybe count the number of 0s added or removed between lines.\n\nIn the first line, the 0s are at positions 4 and 9. The second line has 0s at 4,6,7,9,10,13. So that's adding four 0s. But the output for the first line is [2,2,2]. Hmm. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output numbers are counts of something between the two lines. Let's see another example. Take Example 1:\n\nINPUT:\nLine 0: [5,5,5,5,0,5,5,5,5,0,5,5,5,5]\nLine 1: [0,5,5,0,0,5,5,5,5,0,5,5,5,5]\nLine 2: [0,5,5,0,0,5,0,0,5,0,5,5,5,5]\nLine 3: [5,5,5,5,0,5,0,0,5,0,5,5,5,5]\n\nOUTPUT:\n[3,3,3]\n[4,4,4]\n[2,2,2]\n\nSo output lines are generated from lines 0-1, 1-2, 2-3. Let's check the first pair (0 and 1). Line 0 has 0s at positions 4 and 9. Line 1 has 0s at positions 0,3,4,9. The changes are that positions 0 and 3 in line1 are now 0 where line0 had 5. So two new 0s added. But the output is [3,3,3]. That doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output numbers represent the count of 0s in each segment of the input array. Let's see. The input arrays have 0s in certain positions. Maybe split the array into groups and count the number of 0s in each group. For example, in Example 0's first input line, there are 0s at positions 4 and 9. The output is [2,2,2]. Wait, maybe the number of 0s in the input line? But the first line of Example 0's input has two 0s, but the first output is [2,2,2]. But that's three elements, each 2. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is related to the changes between consecutive input lines. For instance, between line0 and line1 in Example0, how many positions have changed from 5 to 0, or 0 to 5. Let's see:\n\nLine0: 5,5,5,5,0,5,5,5,5,0,5,5,5,5\nLine1: 5,5,5,5,0,5,0,0,5,0,0,5,5,0\n\nComparing each position:\n\nPositions where line0 and line1 differ:\n\n6: 5 \u2192 0\n7:5\u21920\n9:0\u21920 (same)\n10:5\u21920\n13:5\u21920\n\nSo four positions where 5 became 0. Then why output [2,2,2]? Maybe not.\n\nWait, the output lines have three numbers. So maybe each output line is derived from three different aspects of the input lines. Alternatively, perhaps each output line is based on the differences between two consecutive input lines, and the three numbers represent something like the number of 0s added, removed, or something else.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output numbers are digits of a three-digit number, but all digits are same. Like 222, which is 2 repeated. But how does that relate to the input?\n\nLooking at Example 0's first output line [2,2,2]. The input lines 0 and 1. Let's count the number of 0s in line1: positions 4,6,7,9,10,13. That's six 0s. Line0 has two 0s. So the difference is +4. But 4 isn't related to 2. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's the number of 0 blocks. Like, in line0 of Example0, there are two 0s (positions 4 and 9), each isolated. So two blocks. But the output is [2,2,2], which could be three times the number of blocks? Not sure.\n\nWait, let's think of the input arrays as having 14 elements. 14 is 2*7. Maybe split into groups of two, or seven. Or perhaps each line is split into three parts. Let's see. 14 elements. If divided into three parts, maybe 5,5,4? Or 4,5,5? Not sure. Alternatively, maybe the numbers 5 and 0 represent something else, like binary (5 as 1, 0 as 0), and then convert to another form.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output numbers are the sum of certain sections. For example, in line1 of Example0's input, the sum of 0s (each 0 is 0, 5 is 5). But the sum would be 5*(number of 5s). But the output is 2,2,2. That doesn't fit.\n\nWait, maybe the input lines are segments of a digital display, like seven-segment displays. Each number is represented by a 7-segment display, and 14 elements could represent two digits. For example, each digit uses 7 segments. But 14 elements would be two digits. But then, how does that map to the output? The output has three numbers, so perhaps three digits. But the input lines are four, each with 14 elements. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, think of each input line as a 14-element array, perhaps divided into two parts of 7 elements each. Then each 7-element part represents a digit (like a seven-segment display). Then, for each pair of lines, compare the digits and count the differences. But the output numbers are three digits. Let's check Example0:\n\nFirst input line: [5,5,5,5,0,5,5,5,5,0,5,5,5,5]. Split into two 7-element arrays: [5,5,5,5,0,5,5] and [5,5,0,5,5,5,5]. Wait, but how to convert that into a digit. If 5 represents a segment being on and 0 off, then maybe each 7-element array is a digit. Let's see:\n\nFor the first 7 elements: [5,5,5,5,0,5,5]. Let's index them as segments a to g:\n\nAssuming standard 7-segment labeling:\n\na\nf b\ng\ne c\nd\n\nEach position in the array corresponds to a segment. For example, position 0 is a, 1 is b, 2 is c, 3 is d, 4 is e, 5 is f, 6 is g. Then, if the elements are 5 (maybe considered as 'on'), and 0 as off.\n\nSo the first part: a=5 (on), b=5 (on), c=5 (on), d=5 (on), e=0 (off), f=5 (on), g=5 (on). So the segments a, b, c, d, f, g are on. That would form the digit 9 (since segments a, b, c, d, f, g are on, which is 9). The second part is [5,5,0,5,5,5,5]. So a=5 (on), b=5 (on), c=0 (off), d=5 (on), e=5 (on), f=5 (on), g=5 (on). Segments a, b, d, e, f, g on. That would form the digit 6. So the first line represents 9 and 6. Then the output would relate to these digits. But the output is [2,2,2]. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each input line represents two digits, and the output counts how many segments are different between the digits in consecutive lines. For example, comparing the first and second line's two digits. But this is getting complicated.\n\nLet's take Example0 again. Line0 is two digits (maybe 9 and 6), line1 is two digits. Let's parse line1's first 7 elements:\n\n[5,5,5,5,0,5,0,0,5,0,0,5,5,0]. Wait, the input line is split into two 7-element parts. Wait, line1 is [5,5,5,5,0,5,0,0,5,0,0,5,5,0]. Split into first 7: [5,5,5,5,0,5,0] and next 7: [0,5,0,0,5,5,0]. Wait, no, 14 elements split into two 7s. So first 7 elements are positions 0-6, then 7-13. So line1's first part: [5,5,5,5,0,5,0] (elements 0-6). Then segments a=5, b=5, c=5, d=5, e=0, f=5, g=0. So segments a, b, c, d, f are on. That would be the digit 3 (since segments a, b, c, d, g are on for 3, but here g is off. Hmm, maybe I'm getting the segments wrong. Alternatively, maybe the mapping is different.\n\nThis approach seems complicated. Let's think of another angle.\n\nLooking at the outputs, all elements in each output array are the same. So each output line is three copies of a single number. The numbers in the examples are 2, 3,4,8. Perhaps each number represents the count of transitions between 5 and 0 in some way.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output numbers are the sum of the indices where 0s are present in each input line. For example, in Example0's first input line, the 0s are at positions 4 and 9. Sum of indices: 4+9=13. But the output is 2,2,2. No.\n\nAlternatively, the number of times the pattern changes from 5 to 0 or 0 to 5 in the array. For instance, in the first line of Example0's input: [5,5,5,5,0,5,5,5,5,0,5,5,5,5]. The transitions are at 4 (5\u21920), 5 (0\u21925), 9 (5\u21920), 10 (0\u21925). So four transitions. But the output is [2,2,2]. Doesn't fit.\n\nAnother approach: maybe each output line is the number of 0s in each third of the input array. Let's see: the input array has 14 elements. Dividing into thirds is tricky. 14 divided by 3 is approximately 4, 5, 5. Let's try that. For Example0's first input line: 14 elements. Third 1: 0-4 (5 elements), third 2: 5-9 (5 elements), third 3: 10-13 (4 elements). In the first input line, third 1 has one 0 (position4), third2 has one 0 (position9), third3 has none. So counts are [1,1,0]. But the output is [2,2,2]. Doesn't match.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is related to the number of 0s in the entire input lines. For example, each output line's number is the count of 0s in a particular line. But in Example0's first input line, there are two 0s, output is [2,2,2]. That matches. Then in Example0's second input line (line1), the 0s are at positions4,6,7,9,10,13 \u2192 six 0s. The first output line is [2,2,2], which would correspond to the first line's 0 count. Then the second output line [8,8,8] would correspond to the second line's 0 count (6?), but 6 isn't 8. So that can't be right.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output numbers represent the sum of 0's indices in the input line. For Example0's first input line, sum is 4+9=13 \u2192 but output is 2. Doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output numbers are the number of 0s in each input line multiplied by some factor. Like for Example0's line1 (six 0s), the output is [8,8,8], which is 6*1.333, but that's not helpful.\n\nWait, looking at Example0's output lines:\n\nFirst output: [2,2,2] (probably 2)\nSecond: [8,8,8] (8)\nThird: [3,3,3] (3)\n\nNow, looking at the input lines for Example0:\n\nLine0: two 0s \u2192 output 2?\nLine1: six 0s \u2192 output 8?\nLine2: same as line1 \u2192 output 3?\nNo, that doesn't make sense. Or maybe the outputs are between consecutive lines.\n\nWait, the output has three lines, and there are four input lines. So for three transitions between the four lines. So output line 0 is for line0 to line1, line1 to line2, line2 to line3.\n\nSo for Example0:\n\nOutput line0: [2,2,2] \u2192 derived from line0 to line1.\n\nLine0 has two 0s, line1 has six 0s. The difference is +4. But output is 2. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, the number of positions where a 0 was added (from line0 to line1). Line0 has 0s at 4 and 9. Line1 has 0s at 4,6,7,9,10,13. So added 0s at 6,7,10,13. That's four additions. But output is 2. So maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, the number of 0s that are in the same position in both lines. Line0 and line1 have 0s at 4 and 9 in common. So two common 0s. The output is 2, which matches. Then output line0 is [2,2,2]. That could be possible.\n\nThen output line1 is between line1 and line2. Line1 and line2 are identical, so the number of common 0s is six. But the output is [8,8,8]. So that doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. Another possibility: the number of changes (from 5 to 0 or 0 to 5) between consecutive lines. For example, line0 to line1 in Example0: how many positions changed? As before, positions6,7,10,13 changed from 5 to 0. So four changes. Output is 2. Doesn't match.\n\nAlternatively, the number of 0s in line1 minus line0's 0s is 6-2=4. But output is 2. Not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the count of the 0s in the input line's even indices, odd indices, etc. But not sure.\n\nAnother angle: looking at the outputs for each example. Example0's outputs are 2,8,3. Example1:3,4,2. Example2:8,2,4. Example3:2,4,2. The numbers are 2,3,4,8. These are the same numbers found in seven-segment displays (like the segments needed to form the digits). For example, 2 is the digit 2 which uses 5 segments. Wait, but maybe not. Alternatively, these numbers could correspond to the number of segments that are lit in a seven-segment display. For example, digit 2 uses 5 segments, 3 uses 5, 4 uses 4, 8 uses 7. But the numbers in the output are 2,3,4,8. So perhaps each output line's number represents a digit, and each output array has three copies of that digit.\n\nSo, perhaps the input lines are being transformed into digits, and the output lines are three copies of that digit. Then, each output line corresponds to a digit derived from the corresponding pair of input lines.\n\nBut how to get from the input lines to the digits.\n\nAlternatively, each input line is a binary number (5 as 1, 0 as 0), converted to decimal, then mod 10 or something. But let's see. For Example0's first input line, converting the 14 bits (5s as 1s) would be a very large number. Then the output is 2, which doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each input line is divided into three parts, and the sum of each part's 0s modulo 10 gives the number. For example, split into three parts, but 14 elements can't be split into three equal parts. Maybe first part 5 elements, second 5, third 4. Then count the 0s in each part. For Example0's first input line, first part (positions0-4): 5,5,5,5,0 \u2192 one 0. Second part (5-9):5,5,5,5,0 \u2192 one 0. Third part (10-13):5,5,5,5 \u2192 zero 0s. Summing each part's 0 count: 1,1,0. But output is [2,2,2]. Not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each output line is the sum of all 0s in three different regions of the input line. For example, the input is divided into three regions, and each output number is the count of 0s in each region, but repeated three times. But in Example0's first output line [2,2,2], that would mean each region has two 0s, but the first line only has two 0s in total. So that's not possible.\n\nAnother approach: Let's look for the number of 0s in each input line and see if that relates to the output. For example:\n\nExample0:\n\nInput lines:\nLine0: 2 zeros \u2192 output [2,2,2]\nLine1: 6 zeros \u2192 output [8,8,8]\nLine2: 6 zeros \u2192 output [3,3,3]\nLine3: 2 zeros \u2192 but the output for line2-3 is [3,3,3]\n\nWait, the output for line0-1 is [2,2,2]. Line0 has 2 zeros. Line1 has 6. So maybe the difference is 6-2=4, but output is 2. Not sure.\n\nExample1:\n\nOutput lines are 3,4,2.\n\nInput lines:\n\nLine0: 2 zeros \u2192 output3\nLine1: 4 zeros (positions0,3,4,9)\nLine2: 6 zeros (positions0,3,4,6,7,9)\nLine3:4 zeros (positions4,6,7,9)\n\nSo outputs are 3,4,2. Line0 to line1: from 2 to 4 zeros \u2192 difference +2. Output3.\n\nHmm, not clear.\n\nAlternative idea: Maybe the output numbers are the number of transitions between 5 and 0 in the input lines. For example, in line0 of Example0, the transitions are 5\u21920, 0\u21925, 5\u21920, 0\u21925. That's four transitions. Output is [2,2,2]. Doesn't match.\n\nAlternatively, the number of groups of consecutive 0s. In line0 of Example0: two separate 0s \u2192 two groups. Output is [2,2,2]. That matches. Line1 has 0s at positions4,6,7,9,10,13. So groups: position4 (single), 6-7 (group of two), 9-10 (group of two), 13 (single). So four groups. Output is [8,8,8]. Doesn't match.\n\nThis is getting tricky. Let's think of another angle. Maybe the input lines are being transformed into some geometric shape, and the output numbers represent the number of enclosed areas in the digits. For example, 0 has one enclosed area, 8 has two, etc. So the output numbers could represent the number of enclosed areas in a digit formed by the input line.\n\nBut how to get from the input lines to a digit. For example, if the input line represents a 7-segment display. Let's try that again. Taking Example0's first input line, which is split into two 7-element parts. The first part is [5,5,5,5,0,5,5]. Let's consider each 5 as a segment that's on (1), 0 as off (0). So segments a=1, b=1, c=1, d=1, e=0, f=1, g=1. So the segments lit are a, b, c, d, f, g. Which forms the digit 9. The second part is [5,5,0,5,5,5,5]. So segments a=1, b=1, c=0, d=1, e=1, f=1, g=1. This forms the digit 6. So the two digits are 9 and 6. Now, the output for the first line is [2,2,2]. How does 9 and 6 relate to 2? The number of enclosed areas in 9 is 1 (like a circle and a line), but 6 has one enclosed area. So total 2? If each digit's enclosed areas are summed, 9 (1) + 6 (1) = 2. Then the output [2,2,2] could be three copies of that sum. \n\nLet's check this hypothesis with Example0. Line0: 9 and 6 \u2192 1+1=2 \u2192 output [2,2,2]. Then line1: [5,5,5,5,0,5,0,0,5,0,0,5,5,0] \u2192 first 7 elements: [5,5,5,5,0,5,0] \u2192 a=5(on), b=5, c=5, d=5, e=0, f=5, g=0. So segments a, b, c, d, f. Which is the digit 3. The second part: [0,5,0,0,5,5,0] \u2192 a=0, b=5, c=0, d=0, e=5, f=5, g=0. Segments b, e, f. Which is a segment pattern that doesn't correspond to a standard digit. Hmm, maybe not. Alternatively, maybe the first part is a different digit. If segments a, b, c, d, f are on, then maybe digit 3. But 3 has segments a, b, c, d, g. So if g is off, that's not 3. Maybe it's a modified 3. This approach is getting too complicated.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each input line represents two digits (each 7 segments), and the output line is the sum of the enclosed areas in those two digits. For Example0's line0: 9 (1 enclosed area) +6 (1) =2 \u2192 output [2,2,2]. That fits. Then line1's two digits: suppose they are 3 (1 enclosed area?) and some other digit. If the second digit has 0 enclosed areas, sum is 1+0=1. But output is [8,8,8]. Doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output numbers are the sum of the enclosed areas of the two digits. For example, 8 has two enclosed areas, 9 has one, etc. So in Example0's line0, 9 (1) +6 (1) =2 \u2192 output 2. That works. Line1's first digit is 3 (which has 1 enclosed area?), second digit perhaps 8 (2), sum 3 \u2192 output [3,3,3]. But Example0's output for line1 is [8,8,8]. Hmm, conflicting.\n\nAnother thought: the numbers in the output are the same as the digits in the seven-segment display when certain segments are lit. For example, if the output is 8, which uses all seven segments, then perhaps the input line has all segments lit (all 5s). But in Example0's line0, which has 5s except for two 0s, that's not the case. \n\nMaybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's look for another pattern.\n\nAnother observation: the outputs are three identical numbers. Maybe the number is derived from the number of times a certain pattern appears in the input lines. For example, the number of times \"0,5\" occurs, or \"5,0\" in the array. Let's check Example0's first line:\n\n[5,5,5,5,0,5,5,5,5,0,5,5,5,5]\n\nThe transitions from 5 to 0 are at index4. Then 0 to5 at index5. Then 5 to0 at index9. 0 to5 at index10. So two 5\u21920 transitions and two 0\u21925 transitions. Total four transitions. Output is 2,2,2. Half of that, but not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the number of times \"0\" appears in pairs. In Example0's line1: zeros at 4,6,7,9,10,13. Pairs are (6,7) and (9,10). So two pairs. Output is [8,8,8]. Doesn't match.\n\nAlternatively, the output is the count of 0s in the input line divided by two. Example0 line0: 2 zeros \u2192 1. But output is 2. No.\n\nAnother idea: each input line is divided into three parts, and the output number is the count of 0s in each part, but multiplied by some factor. For example, first part has 1 zero \u2192 1*2=2. Second part 1 \u2192 2. Third part 0 \u2192 2. So sum is 1+1+0=2, but output is 2. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the output numbers are the number of 0s in each of three different rows. But the input is four rows. Not sure.\n\nLooking at the test input:\n\nTest Input:\n[5,5,5,5,0,5,5,5,5,0,5,5,5,5]\n[5,5,5,5,0,0,5,5,0,0,5,0,0,5]\n[5,0,0,5,0,0,5,5,0,0,5,0,0,5]\n[5,0,0,5,0,5,5,5,5,0,5,5,5,5]\n\nWe need to generate three output lines. Applying the pattern we found from the training examples.\n\nAssuming the pattern is that each output line corresponds to the number of enclosed areas in the two digits represented by consecutive input lines. \n\nFor example, between line0 and line1 of the test input:\n\nLine0: [5,5,5,5,0,5,5,5,5,0,5,5,5,5] \u2192 split into two parts. First part: positions0-6: [5,5,5,5,0,5,5]. Assuming this represents a digit with a=5 (on), b=5, c=5, d=5, e=0 (off), f=5, g=5. Segments a, b, c, d, f, g are on. This is digit 9 (which has one enclosed area). The second part: positions7-13: [5,5,5,5,0,5,5,5,5] \u2192 wait, no, line0 is 14 elements. Split into two 7-element parts. So first part: 0-6 \u2192 [5,5,5,5,0,5,5], second part:7-13 \u2192 [5,5,5,5,0,5,5]. So both parts are the same as the first part. So both digits are 9. So enclosed areas per digit is 1 each. Total 2. So output line0 would be [2,2,2].\n\nThen line1 of the test input: [5,5,5,5,0,0,5,5,0,0,5,0,0,5]. Split into two 7-element parts. First part:0-6: [5,5,5,5,0,0,5]. Segments a=5 (on), b=5, c=5, d=5, e=0, f=0, g=5. So segments a, b, c, d, g are on. This forms digit 3 (which has one enclosed area). The second part:7-13: [5,0,0,5,0,0,5]. Segments a=5, b=0, c=0, d=5, e=0, f=0, g=5. So segments a, d, g are on. This forms a shape like a \"U\" but maybe not a standard digit. Or perhaps it's an invalid digit. Alternatively, if g is on (segment g is the middle), then with a and d, it's unclear. Maybe the digit is 2, which has segments a, b, g, e, d. But here, b and e are off. So this is not a valid digit. So this approach might not work.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output numbers are not based on the digits but something else. Let's think differently.\n\nAnother observation: the output numbers in the examples are 2,3,4,8. These are the same as the number of letters in the words \"two\", \"three\", \"four\", \"eight\". But 2 is 'two' (3 letters), which doesn't match. So that's probably not.\n\nAlternatively, the numbers are ASCII codes. 2 is 50, 3 is 51, which doesn't fit. So no.\n\nAnother idea: the output numbers are the count of the number of 0s in each input line, but in some way. For example, the test input's first line has two 0s. So output 2. But in Example0's line1 has six 0s, output is 8. So perhaps the count is mapped as follows: 2\u21922, 6\u21928, 3\u21923, etc. But how?\n\nWait, maybe it's the number of 0s in binary. 2 in binary is 10, which has two 1's. Not sure. 6 in binary is 110 (three 1's). Output is 8. Doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, the count of 0s is multiplied by some factor. For example, 2 zeros *1=2 \u2192 output 2. 6 zeros \u21926*1.333=8. But that's not logical.\n\nThis is getting me stuck. Let's try to look for another pattern in the examples.\n\nLooking at Example0:\n\nInput lines 0 and 1:\n\nLine0: two 0s \u2192 output [2,2,2]\nLine1: six 0s \u2192 output [8,8,8]\nLine2: six 0s \u2192 output [3,3,3]\nLine3: two 0s \u2192 output [3,3,3] (but the output is [3,3,3] for line2-line3)\n\nWait, perhaps the output is the sum of the previous line's 0 count and the current line's 0 count. For example, line0 to line1: 2 +6=8. But output is [2,2,2]. No.\n\nAlternatively, the product. 2*6=12. Not matching.\n\nAnother idea: the output numbers correspond to the number of 0s in the input line, but using a different base. For example, 6 in base 5 is 11, but output is 8. Not matching.\n\nAlternatively, the number of 0s in the input line is the number of corners in a shape. For example, 2 zeros could be a line (two endpoints, but not sure).\n\nAlternatively, think of each input line as a binary number where 0s are 1s and 5s are 0s, then convert to decimal and take some digits. For Example0's line1, which has six 0s, the binary would have 1s at positions4,6,7,9,10,13. But converting that binary number to decimal would be a large number. For example, the binary is 0000100000000000 (assuming 14 bits), but it's hard to see.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the sum of the positions where 0s occur. For Example0's line0: 4+9=13 \u2192 1+3=4. Output is 2. No.\n\nAnother approach: look for patterns in the changes between input lines. For example, in Example0's output lines:\n\n[2,2,2], [8,8,8], [3,3,3]\n\nThe numbers are 2,8,3. Could this be related to the number of 0s added between lines? For line0 to line1: 4 added 0s. But output is 2. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, the number of pairs of 0s. In line1 of Example0, there are six 0s. How many pairs of consecutive 0s? Positions6-7, 9-10. Two pairs. So output 2*4=8? But why?\n\nAlternatively, each output line's number is derived from the number of 0s in the line, multiplied by the number of transitions between 5 and 0. For Example0's line0: 2 zeros, 4 transitions \u2192 2*4=8. But output is 2. No.\n\nThis is really challenging. Let's try to find a different pattern.\n\nLooking at Example0's output lines:\n\n[2,2,2]\n[8,8,8]\n[3,3,3]\n\nObserving the numbers 2,8,3. These could relate to the number of 0s in certain positions. For example, the output for the first line is 2, which matches the two 0s in line0. The output for the second line is 8, but line1 has six 0s. Not matching. \n\nWait, maybe the output numbers are the sum of the indices of the 0s. For line0: 4+9=13 \u2192 1+3=4. Not 2. No.\n\nAlternatively, the product of the indices. 4*9=36 \u2192 3+6=9. No.\n\nAnother idea: the output is the count of 0s in the previous line plus the count in the current line. For line0 to line1: 2 +6=8. Output is 2. No.\n\nAlternatively, the count of 0s in the current line minus the previous line. For line0 to line1:6-2=4. Output is 2. So half of that? Maybe.\n\nIn Example0's first output line, 4/2=2. Second output line is between line1 and line2, which have same number of zeros (6-6=0 \u2192 output 8. No. Doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, the number of 0s in the current line divided by the number in the previous line. 6/2=3. Output is 2. No.\n\nAnother possibility: the output numbers correspond to the number of 0s in each line when arranged in a certain way. For example, the output for line1 of Example0 is [8,8,8], which has three 8s. 8 is the sum of the number of 0s in line1 (6) plus 2. 6+2=8. Then line2 has 6 0s, 6+2=8, but output is 3. No.\n\nThis is getting me nowhere. Let's try to look for a different pattern.\n\nLooking at the test input:\n\nTest input lines:\n\nLine0: [5,5,5,5,0,5,5,5,5,0,5,5,5,5] \u2192 two 0s.\n\nLine1: [5,5,5,5,0,0,5,5,0,0,5,0,0,5] \u2192 zeros at positions4,5,8,9,11,12,13. That's seven 0s?\n\nWait, let's count:\n\nLine1:\n\n0:5 \u21925\n\n1:5\u21925\n\n2:5\u21925\n\n3:5\u21925\n\n4:0\n\n5:0\n\n6:5\u21925\n\n7:5\u21925\n\n8:0\n\n9:0\n\n10:5\u21925\n\n11:0\n\n12:0\n\n13:5\u21925.\n\nSo zeros are at positions4,5,8,9,11,12. That's six 0s.\n\nLine2: [5,0,0,5,0,0,5,5,0,0,5,0,0,5] \u2192 zeros at positions1,2,4,5,8,9,11,12. Eight zeros.\n\nLine3: [5,0,0,5,0,5,5,5,5,0,5,5,5,5] \u2192 zeros at positions1,2,4,9. Four zeros.\n\nIf the output is based on the number of 0s in each line, then for the test input:\n\nOutput lines would be between lines0-1, 1-2, 2-3.\n\nLet's see:\n\nLine0 has 2 zeros, line1 has 6, line2 has 8, line3 has4.\n\nBut the outputs from the examples don't directly match the 0 counts. For example, in Example0, line1 has6 0s and output is8. So 6\u21928.\n\nSimilarly, line2 in Example0 has6 0s \u2192 output3. So maybe the output is not directly the count but a transformation of it.\n\nLooking for a pattern between the number of 0s and the output numbers:\n\nExample0:\n\nCounts: 2 \u21922,6\u21928,6\u21923,2\u21923. Not clear.\n\nExample1:\n\nLine0:2 \u21923.\n\nLine1:4 \u21924.\n\nLine2:6\u21922.\n\nLine3:4\u2192?\n\nExample1's outputs are3,4,2.\n\nSo 2\u21923,4\u21924,6\u21922.\n\nExample2:\n\nOutputs are8,2,4.\n\nCounts in input lines:\n\nExample2's input lines:\n\nLine0:2 zeros \u2192 output8.\n\nLine1:2 zeros \u2192 output2.\n\nLine2:4 zeros \u2192 output4.\n\nLine3:4 zeros \u2192 output4.\n\nSo 2\u21928, 2\u21922,4\u21924.\n\nNo obvious pattern. \n\nExample3:\n\nOutputs are2,4,2.\n\nCounts in input lines:\n\nLine0:2 \u21922.\n\nLine1:2\u21924.\n\nLine2:4\u21922.\n\nLine3:4\u21922.\n\nSo 2\u21922, 2\u21924,4\u21922.\n\nThis seems random. Maybe the pattern is not based on the number of 0s but their positions.\n\nAnother idea: looking for the number of 0s in specific columns across the four input lines. For example, each output line corresponds to a column in the input lines. But the test input has four lines, and the output has three lines.\n\nAlternatively, the output numbers represent the number of 0s in each vertical column of the input lines. For example, in the test input:\n\nLine0: [5,5,5,5,0,5,5,5,5,0,5,5,5,5]\n\nLine1: [5,5,5,5,0,0,5,5,0,0,5,0,0,5]\n\nLine2: [5,0,0,5,0,0,5,5,0,0,5,0,0,5]\n\nLine3: [5,0,0,5,0,5,5,5,5,0,5,5,5,5]\n\nLet's look at each column (vertical) across the four lines. For example, column0:\n\nLine0:5\n\nLine1:5\n\nLine2:5\n\nLine3:5\n\nNo 0s. Column4:\n\nLine0:0\n\nLine1:0\n\nLine2:0\n\nLine3:0\n\nAll zeros. So column4 has four zeros. But how does this relate to the output?\n\nThe output has three lines. Maybe each output line corresponds to a trio of columns. For example, columns0-3,4-7,8-11, but not sure.\n\nAlternatively, each output line corresponds to a row in the input's columns. For example, if each output line counts the number of 0s in a particular row of columns. But this is not clear.\n\nAnother approach: since the outputs are triplets of the same number, perhaps the number is the result of some operation on three different aspects of the input lines. For example, for each pair of consecutive input lines, compute three values and then repeat the average or sum. But the numbers in the examples are not sums or averages.\n\nAlternatively, the output numbers are based on the number of 0s in three different sections of the input lines. For instance, each output line's number is the count of 0s in the first third of the input line, middle third, and last third, then averaged or summed. But again, the numbers don't fit.\n\nAlternatively, the output number is the count of 0s in the input line modulo some number. For example, in Example0's line1, 6 zeros modulo 7 is 6, but output is8. No.\n\nThis is really challenging. Given the time I've spent and not finding a clear pattern, perhaps I should try to look for another angle.\n\nLooking back at the training examples, perhaps the output numbers are the sum of the digits formed by grouping the input array into certain ways. For example, take the input array, split into groups of two elements, sum each group, then take modulo 10. For example:\n\nExample0's first input line: [5,5,5,5,0,5,5,5,5,0,5,5,5,5]\n\nGroup into pairs:\n\n(5,5)=10 \u2192 0 (mod10), (5,5)=10\u21920, (0,5)=5, (5,5)=10\u21920, (5,5)=10\u21920, (5,5)=10\u21920, (5,5)=10\u21920. So the sums modulo10 are [0,0,5,0,0,0,0]. The output is [2,2,2]. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, count the number of 5s in each pair. For example, each pair has two 5s \u2192 but the output is 2. Maybe the number of pairs with two 5s. In Example0's first input line, there are 5 pairs of 5s (the first two pairs, then the fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh). But there are 7 pairs. Not sure.\n\nAnother idea: Maybe the output numbers are the number of times a certain pattern occurs between consecutive input lines. For example, how many positions where both lines have 0. For Example0's first two input lines:\n\nLine0:0s at4,9.\n\nLine1:0s at4,6,7,9,10,13.\n\nThe common 0s are at4 and9 \u2192 two positions. So output is 2,2,2. This fits.\n\nThen, for the second output line in Example0, comparing line1 and line2 (which are identical), all 6 zeros are common. So 6 common zeros \u2192 output is8. But 6 \u21928? Not matching.\n\nWait, but in Example0's second output line is [8,8,8], which would correspond to 6 common zeros. But 6 doesn't equal8. So that's a problem. Unless there's a different pattern.\n\nBut for the test input's first two lines:\n\nLine0 has 0s at4 and9.\n\nLine1 has 0s at4,5,8,9,11,12.\n\nCommon zeros are4 and9 \u2192 two positions. So output would be [2,2,2].\n\nThen, between line1 and line2 of the test input:\n\nLine1's zeros:4,5,8,9,11,12.\n\nLine2's zeros:1,2,4,5,8,9,11,12.\n\nCommon zeros:4,5,8,9,11,12 \u2192 six positions. So output would be6. But looking at the training examples, Example0's line1-line2 has six common zeros and output is8. So 6\u21928. Hmm. What's the pattern here? 6 \u21928? Maybe 6+2=8. But why? Example0's third output line is3, which would be between line2 and line3. Line2 has6 zeros, line3 has two zeros. Common zeros: line2's zeros are4,6,7,9,10,13. Line3's zeros are4 and9. So common zeros:4 and9 \u2192 two positions. So output would be2. But Example0's third output is3. So that doesn't fit.\n\nSo this hypothesis is invalid.\n\nAnother possibility: the output number is the number of zeros in the XOR of the two consecutive input lines. XOR here meaning positions where one line has 0 and the other has 5. For Example0's line0-line1:\n\nLine0: 0s at4,9.\n\nLine1:0s at4,6,7,9,10,13.\n\nXOR positions:6,7,10,13 (line1 has 0s where line0 has 5s) and positions4,9 are common. So the XOR count is4 positions where they differ. Output is2. 4/2=2. So maybe divide by 2.\n\nIn Example0's line1-line2: both have same zeros. XOR count is0. Output is8. 0/2=0. Not matching.\n\nHmm. This is not working.\n\nAnother approach: Looking at the output numbers as ASCII values. 2 is 50, 3 is 51, etc. But 50 in ASCII is '2', but the output is [2,2,2], which is the character '2' repeated. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the numbers correspond to the sum of the digits in the input line. For example, in Example0's first line, sum is 5*12 +0*2 =60+0=60. Sum of digits is6+0=6. Output is2. No.\n\nThis is really frustrating. Let's think of the outputs as numbers and see if they have any relation to the inputs beyond the 0s.\n\nLooking at Example0's output:2,8,3.\n\nIf we think of the input lines as 14 elements, perhaps the outputs are the sum of specific positions. For example, the output is the sum of positions 0,5,10 modulo 10. For Example0's line0:\n\nPositions0:5,5,5,5,0,5,5,5,5,0,5,5,5,5. So 0:5,5:5,10:5 \u2192 sum 5+5+5=15 \u219215 mod10=5. Not 2.\n\nAnother idea: the output is the sum of the indices where 0s occur, modulo 10. For Example0's line0:4+9=13 mod10=3. Output is2. No.\n\nAlternatively, the product of the indices.4*9=36 \u21923+6=9. Output is2. No.\n\nPerhaps the output is the number of unique positions where 0s have appeared up to that line. For Example0:\n\nLine0: two 0s \u2192 2 \u2192 output2.\n\nLine1: six 0s (positions4,6,7,9,10,13). But compared to line0, new positions are6,7,10,13. So unique count is 2 (from line0) +4=6. But output is8. Not matching.\n\nThis is not working. I need to find another approach.\n\nLooking back at the examples, the output numbers are 2,3,4,8. These are all factors of 24 except 8. Not sure.\n\nAnother observation: the output numbers are the same as the number of letters in the spelled-out numbers: two (3 letters), three (5), four (4), eight (5). Doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, the output numbers are the number of strokes needed to write the digit in a seven-segment display. For example, 2 has 5 strokes. But output is2.\n\nI'm stuck. Given the time constraints, perhaps I should try to find a pattern based on the test input and the examples, even if I can't fully justify it.\n\nIn the test input, the first output line is derived from line0 and line1. Let's assume the pattern is that the output number is the count of common 0 positions between consecutive lines. For line0 and line1 of the test input:\n\nLine0's zeros:4,9.\n\nLine1's zeros:4,5,8,9,11,12.\n\nCommon zeros:4,9 \u2192 count 2. So output [2,2,2].\n\nThen line1 and line2: common zeros are4,5,8,9,11,12. Count 6. In Example0, the count of common zeros was6 between line1 and line2, and output was8. So maybe 6 \u21928. How? 6 +2=8. \n\nSimilarly, in Example0's line2 and line3: common zeros are4,9. Count 2 \u2192 output3. 2+1=3. Not sure.\n\nFor the test input's line2 and line3:\n\nLine2's zeros:1,2,4,5,8,9,11,12.\n\nLine3's zeros:1,2,4,9.\n\nCommon zeros:1,2,4,9 \u2192 count 4. So output would be4. But looking at the training examples, when common zeros are4 (Example1's line1 and line2: common zeros are0,3,4,9 \u2192 count4), output is4. So 4 \u21924.\n\nSo for the test input:\n\nOutput line0:2 \u2192 [2,2,2]\n\nOutput line1:6 \u2192 but in Example0, 6\u21928. So perhaps 6 \u21928.\n\nOutput line2:4 \u2192 [4,4,4].\n\nBut why would 6 become8? Maybe it's a different pattern. For example, in Example0's line1 and line2, both have six 0s, and output is8. So perhaps the output is the sum of the number of zeros in the two lines. Line1 and line2 both have6 \u21926+6=12. But output is8. 12 mod 10=2. No.\n\nAlternatively, 6 in octal is 6, in hex is 6. Not helpful.\n\nAnother idea: the output numbers are the number of 0s multiplied by the number of input lines. Not likely.\n\nAlternatively, the sum of the digits in the number of 0s. For example,6 \u21926, which is single digit. Output is8. No.\n\nAlternatively, the number of 0s plus 2. For Example0's line1:6+2=8. Output is8. For line0's line0:2+0=2. No. Hmm.\n\nIf this pattern holds, then for the test input's line1-line2 (6 common zeros), output would be6+2=8. So output line1 is [8,8,8].\n\nThen line2-line3: common zeros 4 \u21924+0=4. So output line2 is [4,4,4].\n\nBut in Example0's line2-line3: common zeros 2 \u21922+1=3 (output is3).\n\nBut this is arbitrary. Why would you add 2 in some cases and 1 in others?\n\nGiven that I'm stuck, perhaps the safest bet is to apply the pattern that the output number is the number of common 0 positions between consecutive lines. For the test input:\n\nLine0-line1:2 \u2192 [2,2,2]\n\nLine1-line2:6 \u2192 but training example0's line1-line2 had 6 and output8. So perhaps 6 maps to8. How?\n\nIf the output is the number of common 0 positions multiplied by a certain factor. For Example0, 2\u21922,6\u21928 (6*1.333=8), 2\u21923. But it's inconsistent.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is the number of common 0 positions plus the number of changes (added/removed 0s). For line0-line1 in Example0: common 0s:2, added 0s:4. 2+4=6 \u2192 output is2. No.\n\nThis is taking too long. Given the examples and the test input, perhaps the correct answer for the test input is:\n\nFirst output line:2 \u2192 [2,2,2]\n\nSecond:6\u21928 \u2192 [8,8,8]\n\nThird:4 \u2192 [4,4,4]\n\nBut looking at the examples:\n\nExample1's line1-line2 common 0s:4 \u2192 output4. Which fits.\n\nExample0's line1-line2 common 0s:6 \u2192 output8. So perhaps 6 \u21928. But how?\n\nAlternatively, the output is the count of common 0s plus the count of new 0s added. For Example0's line1-line2: common 6, new 0s:0 \u21926+0=6. Output8. No.\n\nAlternatively, the output is the number of common 0s plus the number of 0s in the previous line. For Example0 line1-line2:6+6=12 \u2192 output8. 12 mod 10=2. No.\n\nAlternatively, the output is the count of common 0s plus the count of 0s in the next line. For Example0's line1-line2:6+6=12 \u2192 output8. 12-4=8. Not sure.\n\nAt this point, given the time constraints and the need to provide an answer, I'll assume that the pattern is the number of common 0s between consecutive input lines multiplied by a factor of 1.333 (8=6*1.333), but this is arbitrary. However, based on Example0's output for six common zeros being8 and Example1's four common zeros being4, it's possible that the output is the count of common zeros multiplied by 2 for even counts and something else for odd. But this is a stretch.\n\nAlternatively, the output numbers are simply the count of common zeros between consecutive lines. But in Example0, line1-line2 have6 common zeros, but output is8, which contradicts this.\n\nGiven that I can't find a reliable pattern, I'll proceed with the initial hypothesis for the test input:\n\nTest input:\n\nBetween line0 and line1: 2 common zeros \u2192 output [2,2,2]\n\nBetween line1 and line2:6 common zeros \u2192 Example0's similar case had output8 \u2192 so [8,8,8]\n\nBetween line2 and line3:4 common zeros \u2192 Example1's case had output4 \u2192 [4,4,4]\n\nThus, the final answer would be:\n\n[2,2,2]\n[8,8,8]\n[4,4,4]",

The challenge is to understand what rule connects the input arrays to the output triplets.\n\nLooking at the training examples:\n\nFirst, let's look at Example 0:\n\nInput:\nFour arrays:\n1. [5,5,5,5,0,5,5,5,5,0,5,5,5,5]\n2. [5,5,5,5,0,5,0,0,5,0,0,5,5,0]\n3. [5,5,5,5,0,5,0,0,5,0,0,5,5,0]\n4. [5,5,5,5,0,5,5,5,5,0,5,5,5,5]\n\nOutput:\nThree arrays:\n[2,2,2]\n[8,8,8]\n[3,3,3]\n\nHmm, notice that the output has three elements, and there are four input arrays. Maybe each output array corresponds to a comparison between consecutive input arrays. Since there are four input arrays, there are three transitions between them. So each output triplet might be derived from the differences between each pair of consecutive input arrays.\n\nLet me check the other examples to see if this holds.\n\nExample 1:\n\nInput arrays (4), outputs 3 triplets. Yes, same structure. So likely, each output row is derived from comparing input row i and input row i+1.\n\nNow, the question is: how are these comparisons done?\n\nLooking at Example 0's input and output:\n\nInput arrays 1 and 2: compare the first two input arrays. Let's see where they differ.\n\nFirst input array (1): [5,5,5,5,0,5,5,5,5,0,5,5,5,5]\nSecond input array (2): [5,5,5,5,0,5,0,0,5,0,0,5,5,0]\n\nComparing the elements. Let's look at indices where the value changes from 5 to 0 or vice versa.\n\nLooking at positions (indices starting at 0):\n\nAt index 6: 5 becomes 0\nIndex 7: 5 becomes 0\nIndex 9: 0 stays 0?\nWait, no. Let's list all the differences:\n\nOriginal array 1: positions 0-13:\n\nPositions where array 1 is 5: all except index 4,9.\n\nArray 2 has 5s except indices 4,6,7,9,10,13.\n\nSo differences are at indices 6,7,10,13.\n\nHmm. How does that relate to the first output in Example 0, which is [2,2,2]?\n\nWait, maybe the number of 5s turning into 0s between each consecutive pair. Let's check for each transition.\n\nIn the first transition (array 1 to array 2):\n\nOriginal array 1 elements that are 5 and become 0 in array 2. Let's count how many 5s become 0s.\n\nIn array 2, the elements that are 0 where array 1 had 5: indices 6,7,10,13. So four positions. But the output is [2,2,2]. Hmm, not matching.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's the number of 0s introduced. Array 1 has two 0s (indices 4 and 9). Array 2 has 0s at indices 4,6,7,9,10,13. So the new zeros added are at 6,7,10,13. So four new zeros. But how does that become 2?\n\nAlternatively, maybe grouping the array into segments. Let's consider that each array is divided into segments separated by 0s. For example, array 1 in Example 0 has 5s, then 0, then 5s, 0, then 5s. So the structure is 4 fives, 0, 4 fives, 0, 4 fives. So three groups of 5s (lengths 4,4,4). But the output for Example 0 is [2,2,2], [8,8,8], [3,3,3]. Not sure.\n\nWait, maybe the output numbers relate to the number of 5s in each segment after splitting by 0s, but multiplied or transformed somehow. Let's see:\n\nIn Example 0's input array 2 (second array):\n\n[5,5,5,5,0,5,0,0,5,0,0,5,5,0]\n\nSplitting by 0s:\n\nFirst group: 5,5,5,5 (4 fives) \u2192 4\nThen 0\nThen 5 (1 five)\nThen 0,0\nThen 5 (1 five)\nThen 0,0\nThen 5,5 (2 fives)\nThen 0\n\nSo the groups are 4,1,1,2. But how does that relate to the output [8,8,8]?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the sum of digits in each group. 4+1+1+2 = 8? Not sure. But the first output in Example 0 is [2,2,2], which might sum to 6, but that doesn't match.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps looking at the number of transitions between 5 and 0. For example, in the first array, the number of transitions (from 5 to 0 or 0 to 5) is 2 (at index 4 and 9). Then in the second array, transitions are at 4 (5 to 0), then 5 (0 to 5), 6 (5 to 0), 8 (0 to 5), 10 (5 to 0), 11 (0 to 5), 13 (5 to 0). So 7 transitions? But that's not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output numbers represent the number of times a 5 is followed by a 0 in the array. Wait, but each array has 0s in certain positions. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the outputs are related to the positions where 0s are added or removed between consecutive arrays. Let's take Example 0's first transition (array 1 to 2):\n\nArray 1: zeros at positions 4 and 9.\n\nArray 2: zeros at positions 4,6,7,9,10,13.\n\nSo between array 1 and 2, new zeros are added at 6,7,10,13. So four new zeros. But output for the first transition is [2,2,2]. How does four relate to 2? Maybe each new zero is counted as a change, and 4 changes divided by 2? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the number of new 0s added is divided by 2. Four new zeros divided by 2 gives 2. Then the output is 2. But why three elements? Maybe each output triplet's elements correspond to different aspects. But the output is three triplets, each with three same numbers. Wait, in Example 0's output, there are three lines. Each line has three same numbers. So maybe each line corresponds to a transition between two input arrays, and each number in the triplet represents some count from that transition. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is based on the positions where 0s are introduced. For example, in the first transition (array1 to array2), new zeros are added at positions 6,7,10,13. The sum of these positions is 6+7+10+13=36. But how is that 2? Not matching.\n\nAnother approach: looking at the output numbers (2,8,3 in Example 0). Maybe these are ASCII values. 2 is 50, 8 is 56, 3 is 51. But 50 in ASCII is '2', 56 is '8', 51 is '3'. So that's the same as the output numbers. So probably not.\n\nWait, the outputs are triplets of the same number. Maybe each number in the triplet corresponds to a different measure. For example, the first element is the number of new zeros added, the second the number of zeros removed, the third the total changes. But in the first transition of Example 0, there are 4 new zeros added (positions 6,7,10,13), and zeros removed: array1 had zeros at 4 and 9. In array2, those zeros are still present. So no zeros removed. So total changes would be 4. But the output is [2,2,2]. Hmm, not matching.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the number of groups of consecutive 5s in each array. Let's take array2 in Example 0: [5,5,5,5,0,5,0,0,5,0,0,5,5,0]. Splitting by 0s, the groups of 5s are:\n\nFirst group: 4 fives (indices 0-3)\nThen after 0 at 4: group of 1 five (index5)\nThen after 0s at 6,7: group of 1 five (index8)\nThen after 0s at 9,10: group of 2 fives (indices 11-12)\nSo total 4 groups. But the output for the first transition is [2,2,2]. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output numbers are the count of certain patterns in the array. For instance, maybe the number of times a '5,5' pair occurs, but that's just a guess. Let's check:\n\nIn array1 of Example 0, there are many consecutive 5s. But in the transition to array2, some of those are broken by zeros. The output for the first transition is [2,2,2]. Not sure.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps the output numbers correspond to the number of times a segment of 5s is split by the insertion of 0s. For example, in the first array of Example0, after the first 0 (position4), the next segment is four 5s. In the second array, after the first 0 (position4), there's a 5 (position5), then 0s. So maybe that splits the original segment into smaller parts. The number of splits could be 2, leading to the output 2. But this is vague.\n\nLet's look at Example1:\n\nInput arrays:\n\n1. [5,5,5,5,0,5,5,5,5,0,5,5,5,5]\n2. [0,5,5,0,0,5,5,5,5,0,5,5,5,5]\n3. [0,5,5,0,0,5,0,0,5,0,5,5,5,5]\n4. [5,5,5,5,0,5,0,0,5,0,5,5,5,5]\n\nOutput:\n\n[3,3,3]\n[4,4,4]\n[2,2,2]\n\nLooking at the first transition (array1 to array2):\n\nOriginal array1 has zeros at 4 and 9.\n\nArray2 has zeros at 0,3,4,9.\n\nSo comparing array1 to array2:\n\n- At position0: 5\u21920 (new zero)\n- Position3: 5\u21920 (new zero)\n- Position4: already zero\n- Other zeros added? No. So new zeros at 0 and3. So 2 new zeros. But output is [3,3,3]. Hmm, not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the number of 5s turned into 0s. In array1 to array2:\n\nAt positions0 and3: 5\u21920. So 2 changes. But the output is 3. Doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the number of runs of 5s. Let's see:\n\nArray1 has three runs: 4 fives, 4 fives, 4 fives.\n\nArray2 has:\n\nAfter inserting zeros at0 and3, the structure is:\n\n0, then 5,5 (run length 2), then 0,0, then 5,5,5,5 (run length4), 0, then 5,5,5,5 (run length4). So total runs of 5s are 2,4,4 \u2192 three runs. So the count is 3, which matches the first output [3,3,3]. That's possible.\n\nSo perhaps, for each transition between arrays, the output is the number of runs of 5s in the resulting array after the transition. Then each output line corresponds to the number of runs in each of the three transitions (array1\u21922, array2\u21923, array3\u21924). But let's check.\n\nIn Example0's first transition:\n\nOriginal array1 has three runs of 5s (4,4,4).\n\nAfter transition to array2, array2's runs of 5s are 4,1,1,2. So four runs. But the first output is [2,2,2]. That doesn't match. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the number of runs in the second array. But in Example1, the first output is [3,3,3], which would correspond to array2 having three runs of 5s. Wait, array2 in Example1 is [0,5,5,0,0,5,5,5,5,0,5,5,5,5]. The runs of 5s are:\n\nAt indices1-2: two 5s (run length2)\nAt indices5-8: four 5s (run length4)\nAt indices10-13: four 5s (run length4)\nSo three runs. So output is 3. So for the first transition, the output is the number of runs in array2. Then for the second transition (array2 to array3), array3's runs would be:\n\nIn Example1, array3 is [0,5,5,0,0,5,0,0,5,0,5,5,5,5]. Splitting into runs of 5s:\n\nIndices1-2: two 5s\nIndices5: one 5\nIndices8: one 5\nIndices10-13: four 5s\nTotal of four runs. So output would be [4,4,4], which matches the second line of Example1's output. Then the third transition (array3 to array4) in Example1:\n\nArray4 is [5,5,5,5,0,5,0,0,5,0,5,5,5,5]. The runs of 5s:\n\nIndices0-3: four 5s\nIndices5: one 5\nIndices8: one 5\nIndices10-13: four 5s\nTotal three runs. But the third output is [2,2,2]. Wait, this doesn't align. So maybe the hypothesis is incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is the difference in the number of runs between consecutive arrays. For Example1's first transition: array1 has 3 runs (as per original), array2 has 3 runs. So difference is 0, but output is 3. So no.\n\nAlternative approach: let's look at the outputs and see if they can be derived from the number of 0s in each array. For example, in Example0's transitions:\n\nArray1 has 2 zeros, array2 has 6 zeros. The difference is 4. Output [2,2,2]. Not sure.\n\nAnother idea: the output numbers could be related to the sum of all the 0s in the array. For instance, array2 in Example0 has 6 zeros, sum is 6*0=0. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, the sum of the indices where zeros are present. For array2 in Example0, zeros are at 4,6,7,9,10,13. Sum is 4+6+7+9+10+13 = 49. But output is 2. Doesn't match.\n\nWait, maybe the output numbers are related to the number of 5-0 transitions in the array. For example, in array2 of Example0, how many times does a 5 turn into 0 or vice versa when moving from left to right.\n\nArray2: [5,5,5,5,0,5,0,0,5,0,0,5,5,0]\n\nTransitions:\n\nStart with 5, then 0 at index4 (5\u21920: count 1)\nThen 0\u21925 at index5 (count 2)\n5\u21920 at index6 (count3)\n0 remains 0 at 7 (no transition)\n0\u21925 at index8 (count4)\n5\u21920 at index9 (count5)\n0\u21925 at index11 (count6)\n5\u21920 at index13 (count7)\nSo total 7 transitions. Output is 2. Not matching.\n\nHmm, this is getting frustrating. Let's try to find another approach.\n\nLooking at the Test Input:\n\nTest Input:\n[5,5,5,5,0,5,5,5,5,0,5,5,5,5]\n[5,5,5,5,0,0,5,5,0,0,5,0,0,5]\n[5,0,0,5,0,0,5,5,0,0,5,0,0,5]\n[5,0,0,5,0,5,5,5,5,0,5,5,5,5]\n\nExpected Output: ?\n\nWe need to find the pattern so that we can compute the three output triplets here.\n\nAlternative approach: Maybe each output triplet corresponds to the count of 5s in certain positions across the four input arrays. For example, for each position in the array, check if all four arrays have 5, and count how many such positions. But in Example0, the first output is [2,2,2]. Let's see:\n\nIn Example0's four arrays:\n\nEach array is length14. The positions where all four arrays have 5s are:\n\nLooking at each index:\n\nindex0: all 5s \u2192 yes.\nindex1: all 5s \u2192 yes.\nindex2: all 5s \u2192 yes.\nindex3: all 5s \u2192 yes.\nindex4: all 0s \u2192 no.\nindex5: array1 has 5, array2 has 5, array3 has 5, array4 has5. So yes.\nindex6: array1 has5, array2 has0, array3 has0, array4 has5. So not all 5s.\nSo positions 0-3,5 are 5s in all arrays. That's 5 positions. But output is [2,2,2]. Doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the number of positions where consecutive arrays have certain patterns. For example, in the transition between array1 and array2 in Example0, how many positions changed from 5 to 0. We had four positions (6,7,10,13) where array1 had 5 and array2 has 0. So four changes. Output is [2,2,2]. Maybe 4 divided by 2 is 2. But why divided by 2?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each transition's output number is the count of newly introduced 0s divided by 2. So four becomes 2. Then that matches the first output in Example0. Let's check other examples.\n\nIn Example1's first transition:\n\nArray1 to array2: zeros added at positions0 and3. So two new zeros. Divided by 1 (no division) gives 2, but output is [3,3,3]. Doesn't match.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the number of groups of 0s added. For example, in Example0's first transition, zeros are added at 6,7,10,13. These are two separate groups (6-7 and 10,13). So two groups, leading to output 2. That could fit. Let's check.\n\nExample0's first transition: new zeros at 6,7 (consecutive), 10,13 (separate). So two groups (6-7 is one group, 10 and 13 are individual but non-consecutive). So maybe two groups. Hence output [2,2,2]. That could make sense.\n\nIn Example1's first transition: new zeros at positions0 and3. These are separate (non-consecutive), so two groups. But output is [3,3,3]. Doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the number of times a single 0 is inserted (i.e., a new 0 that is not adjacent to another new 0). In Example0's first transition: zeros added at 6 and7 (adjacent, count as one), 10 (single), 13 (single). So three groups. But output is 2. Not matching.\n\nAlternatively, the number of times a new 0 is inserted between two 5s, thereby splitting a run. For example, inserting a 0 between 5s in array1 to create array2.\n\nIn Example0's first transition:\n\nOriginal array1 has a run of 4 fives starting at index5 (after the first 0). In array2, this run is split into 5,0,0,5. So inserting two zeros (positions6 and7) splits the run into two parts. So one split. But the output is 2.\n\nThis line of thought isn't leading me anywhere. Let's think differently.\n\nLooking at the outputs for the examples:\n\nExample0's outputs are [2,2,2], [8,8,8], [3,3,3]. All triplets.\n\nExample1's outputs are [3,3,3], [4,4,4], [2,2,2].\n\nExample2's outputs are [8,8,8], [2,2,2], [4,4,4].\n\nExample3's outputs are [2,2,2], [4,4,4], [2,2,2].\n\nThe numbers 2,3,4,8 repeat. Maybe these numbers represent something like the count of certain patterns or transformations.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps the numbers are related to the sum of the digits in each array. For example, array1 in Example0 has sum (5*4 +0 +5*4 +0 +5*4) = 5*(4+4+4) = 5*12=60. But output numbers are 2,8,3. No connection.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the sum of the digits modulo something. 60 mod 9 is 6. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, count the number of times 5 appears in each array. For array1 in Example0: 12 5s. But output is 2. No.\n\nAnother angle: perhaps the output is related to the positions of 0s in the arrays and their relation to each other. For example, each output line corresponds to a pair of arrays, and the number represents the count of 0s in certain positions across the pair.\n\nAlternatively, think of the arrays as binary, with 5 being 1 and 0 being 0. Then maybe the output is the result of some bitwise operation between consecutive arrays. For example, the XOR between array1 and array2, then count the number of 1s in the XOR result. Let's try:\n\nExample0's first transition (array1 to array2):\n\narray1: 5,5,5,5,0,5,5,5,5,0,5,5,5,5 \u2192 represented as 1s except indices4 and9.\n\narray2:5,5,5,5,0,5,0,0,5,0,0,5,5,0 \u2192 1s except indices4,6,7,9,10,13.\n\nXOR between array1 and array2 would have 1s where the elements differ. So positions6,7,10,13. So four 1s. The count is 4. But output is [2,2,2]. So maybe 4 divided by 2 is 2. That's possible. Then in Example1's first transition:\n\narray1 and array2 XOR. array1's zeros are at4,9. array2's zeros are at0,3,4,9. So XOR would have 1s at0,3. Count is 2. But output is [3,3,3]. Doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the number of transitions (changes from 5 to 0 or 0 to5) between consecutive arrays. For Example0's first transition: 4 changes (positions6,7,10,13). Output is 2. So 4 divided by 2 is 2. For Example1's first transition: 2 changes (positions0 and3). Divided by 1 gives 2, but output is3.\n\nHmm.\n\nAnother idea: the output numbers could be the count of 0s in each of the three transitions' arrays. For example, for the first transition (array2) in Example0, there are 6 zeros. 6 divided by something. 6/3=2. But why 3?\n\nAlternatively, the output numbers are the sum of the indices where new zeros are inserted. For Example0's first transition, new zeros at6,7,10,13. Sum is6+7+10+13=36. 3+6=9. Doesn't match output2.\n\nAlternatively, the sum modulo something. 36 mod 7 is 1. No.\n\nThis is getting too time-consuming. Let's try to look for a different pattern.\n\nLooking at Example0's output:\n\nFirst line: [2,2,2]\n\nSecond: [8,8,8]\n\nThird: [3,3,3]\n\nNow, if I think of the numbers as representing letters (A=1, B=2, etc.), 2 is B, 8 is H, 3 is C. But B H C doesn't form a meaningful acronym. Perhaps not.\n\nAlternatively, the numbers could relate to the number of 'islands' of 5s. For example, in array2 of Example0, the islands of 5s are four separate groups: 4,1,1,2. The sum of these is 8. Then the output for that transition is 8. So the second line in Example0's output is [8,8,8], which could correspond to the sum of the lengths of the 5s islands. Let's check:\n\nFor Example0's second transition (array2 to array3), the arrays are the same. So sum of islands in array3 would be same as array2: 4+1+1+2=8. So output remains 8. Then third transition (array3 to array4). Array4 is [5,5,5,5,0,5,5,5,5,0,5,5,5,5]. Splitting by 0s: three islands of 4,4,4. Sum is 12. But the output is [3,3,3]. So 3, which is the count of islands. Oh! Maybe the output is the number of islands (groups) of 5s in the array after the transition. Let's check:\n\nExample0's first transition (array1 to array2). Array2 has four islands of 5s (4,1,1,2). So output would be 4. But the first output is [2,2,2]. Doesn't fit.\n\nWait, but in Example0's output, the second line is [8,8,8], which could be the sum of the islands' lengths. For array2, sum is4+1+1+2=8. So the output line corresponds to sum of lengths. Then the third line's output is3, which would be the number of islands (array4 has three islands). But how does this relate to the output lines?\n\nThe output has three lines, each corresponding to a transition between input arrays. For each transition, maybe the output line's number is the sum of the islands' lengths in the new array.\n\nExample0's transitions:\n\nTransition1: array1 to array2. array2's islands sum to 4+1+1+2=8. But the first output line is [2,2,2]. Doesn't match. So that theory is incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, the output line could be the count of islands in the new array. For array2 in Example0's first transition: four islands. Output is [2,2,2]. No match.\n\nAnother angle: perhaps the output numbers are the count of 0s added in the transition divided by the number of input arrays. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the output numbers could be related to the binary representation of the 0 positions. For example, in Example0's first transition, new zeros are at positions6,7,10,13. If we represent each position in binary, sum the bits, but this seems too complex.\n\nAlternatively, think of each array as a 14-digit number where 5 is 1 and 0 is 0. Then, the number could be treated as a binary number and converted to decimal. For array2 in Example0:\n\nThe binary would be 11110100100010 (assuming 5 is 1, 0 is 0). Converting this binary number to decimal: let's compute:\n\nThe binary digits are:\n\nPositions 0-13:\n\n1 1 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0.\n\nWait, that's:\n\n1111 0100 1000 10.\n\nBreaking it into parts:\n\n1111 (15), 0100 (4), 1000 (8), 10 (2). Not sure. But 15+4+8+2=29. Doesn't match 2.\n\nThis approach isn't working.\n\nMaybe I need to think outside the box. The outputs are triplets of the same number. Each number is repeated three times. Maybe each triplet corresponds to three different attributes of the transition, but all attributes are the same for that transition. For example, in Example0's first transition, the number is 2, which could represent the number of new 0s added divided by 2 (4/2=2), the number of new 0 groups (2 groups: 6-7 and 10,13), and something else. But why all three elements are the same.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output triplet is not three separate values but a single value repeated three times, and the challenge is to determine that value based on the transition. So the triplet is redundant, and the actual answer is just the single number, but presented in triplet form.\n\nNow, considering the Test Input:\n\nTest Input arrays:\n\n1. [5,5,5,5,0,5,5,5,5,0,5,5,5,5]\n2. [5,5,5,5,0,0,5,5,0,0,5,0,0,5]\n3. [5,0,0,5,0,0,5,5,0,0,5,0,0,5]\n4. [5,0,0,5,0,5,5,5,5,0,5,5,5,5]\n\nWe need to compute three triplets for transitions 1\u21922, 2\u21923, 3\u21924.\n\nLet's analyze each transition:\n\nTransition 1\u21922 (array1 to array2):\n\nCompare array1 and array2.\n\narray1: zeros at indices4,9.\n\narray2: zeros at indices4,5,8,9,12,13.\n\nSo new zeros added at indices5,8,12,13.\n\nCount of new zeros: 4.\n\nIf the pattern is new zeros divided by 2, 4/2=2. So output triplet [2,2,2].\n\nTransition 2\u21923 (array2 to array3):\n\narray2 zeros at4,5,8,9,12,13.\n\narray3 zeros at0,1,4,5,8,9,12,13.\n\nNew zeros added at0,1.\n\nCount of new zeros: 2. Divided by 2 gives 1. But need to see if this matches any example.\n\nWait, in Example2's output:\n\nExample2's input:\n\narray1: zeros at4,9.\n\narray2: zeros at4,0 (assuming array2 is [5,0,0,5,0,5,5,5,5,0,5,5,5,5] \u2192 zeros at indices1,2,4,9, etc. Not sure. But according to Example2's output, one of the transitions gives [8,8,8]. Perhaps when the sum of the 5s' groups is 8.\n\nBut perhaps in the Test Input's transition2\u21923, the new zeros are at0 and1. So two new zeros. Divided by 2 gives 1. But this doesn't match any previous examples.\n\nAlternatively, if the output is the number of new zero groups added. For transition1\u21922: new zeros at5,8,12,13. These are separate:5 is next to4 (existing zero), 8 is new, 12 and13 are adjacent. So groups:5 is part of existing zeros at4, making a group of two zeros (indices4-5), 8 is a new single zero (but array2 has 0 at8 and9? Wait array2 is [5,5,5,5,0,0,5,5,0,0,5,0,0,5]. So zeros at4,5,8,9,12,13. So indices4-5 are zeros (two), 8-9 (two), 12-13 (two). So in transition1\u21922, the new zeros are at5,8,9,12,13. Wait, array1 had zeros at4 and9. array2 adds zeros at5,8,12,13. So array2's zeros are4,5,8,9,12,13. So new zeros are5,8,12,13. These are added. The existing zeros are4 and9 (from array1). \n\nSo the new zeros are added in three groups:5 (adjacent to existing zero at4, forming a group of two), 8 and9 (but array2's zeros at8 and9 are added. Array1's array2 had 9 as zero, so array2's 8 is new, 9 was existing. So in transition1\u21922, array2's zeros at8 and9: 8 is new, 9 was existing. So new zeros at5,8,12,13. These are four zeros. Grouping them:\n\n5 is adjacent to existing zero (4), forming a group of two zeros. 8 is a new zero (not adjacent to existing zeros), 12 and13 are adjacent to each other, forming a new group. So total three new groups of zeros added. If the output is the number of new zero groups added, then 3. But in the first transition of Example0, the output is 2, which would correspond to two new zero groups.\n\nLooking at Example0's first transition:\n\narray1 to array2: new zeros are6,7,10,13. These form two groups (6-7 and10,13). So two new groups. Output is [2,2,2]. That fits.\n\nIn Example1's first transition: array1 to array2 adds zeros at0 and3. Two new groups (each single zero). Output is [3,3,3]. Doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. But in Test Input's transition1\u21922, new zeros are5,8,12,13. Which form three new groups (5 adjacent to existing, 8, and 12-13). So three new groups. So output would be 3. But previous examples don't align.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the number of new groups of zeros added, regardless of existing. For Example0's transition1\u21922: new zeros at6,7,10,13. Two groups (6-7, 10 and13). Output is 2. So matches.\n\nTest transition1\u21922 has new zeros at5,8,12,13. Groups:\n\n5 is added next to existing zero at4 \u2192 forms a longer group. But does that count as a new group? If we consider that the existing group was at4 (single), then adding 5 makes it two zeros (4-5). But this is an extension, not a new group. Then new groups added are 8 (single), 12-13 (group of two). So two new groups. Output would be 2. Which would make the triplet [2,2,2].\n\nThen transition2\u21923:\n\narray2 to array3. array3's zeros are0,1,4,5,8,9,12,13. \n\narray2's zeros were4,5,8,9,12,13. So new zeros added at0 and1. These form a group of two. So one new group added. Output would be [1,1,1]. But looking at the examples, the outputs are numbers like 2,3,4,8. So 1 might not appear. But in Example3's output, there's [4,4,4]. So possible.\n\nThen transition3\u21924 (array3 to array4):\n\narray3's zeros are0,1,4,5,8,9,12,13.\n\narray4's zeros are4,9.\n\nSo array4 removes zeros at0,1,5,8,12,13. So new zeros added are none, but removed many. So perhaps the number of new zero groups added is zero, but this complicates things. Alternatively, the pattern might consider both additions and removals. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the number of new zero groups added in the transition. For transition3\u21924, array4 has zeros at4 and9. So compared to array3, which had more zeros, array4 has removed zeros. So new zero groups added: none. But the output would be 0, which we haven't seen in examples. So this line of thought might not be correct.\n\nPerhaps the pattern is different. Let's consider the following approach for the test input:\n\nFor each transition between input arrays, count the number of new zero groups added, where a group is one or more consecutive zeros. Each new group added contributes to the output number.\n\nTest transition1\u21922:\n\narray1 to array2.\n\narray1 zeros at4,9 (two separate groups).\n\narray2 zeros at4-5 (group1),8-9 (group2),12-13 (group3).\n\nSo compared to array1, the new zero groups added are 4-5 (existing zero at4, new zero at5 makes it a group of two), 8-9 (existing zero at9, new zero at8?), array2's 8 and9 are new zeros. Wait, array1's array2 is [5,5,5,5,0,0,5,5,0,0,5,0,0,5]. So zeros are at4,5,8,9,12,13. So array1's zeros were at4 and9. So in array2, new zeros are at5,8,12,13. \n\nThe groups in array2 are:\n\n4-5 (two zeros), 8-9 (two zeros), 12-13 (two zeros). So compared to array1, which had two single zeros (4 and9), the new groups are formed by adding adjacent zeros. So the number of new groups added is 3: two existing zeros are expanded into groups, and two new groups. Wait, this is confusing.\n\nAlternatively, the number of new zero groups in array2 that were not present in array1. array1 had two single zeros (4 and9). array2 has three groups (4-5,8-9,12-13). So new groups added are 4-5 (combining 4 with new 5), 8-9 (combining 9 with new 8?), and 12-13. So the number of new groups is 3. If the output is this count, then 3. But according to Example0's first transition, new groups added were two (6-7 and10,13). Output was 2. This would fit.\n\nIn Test transition1\u21922, the new groups added are three: 4-5, 8-9,12-13. So output would be [3,3,3]. \n\nThen transition2\u21923 (array2 to array3):\n\narray3's zeros are0-1,4-5,8-9,12-13. \n\narray2's zeros were4-5,8-9,12-13. \n\nNew zeros added at0-1. So new group is0-1. So one new group. Output would be [1,1,1].\n\nTransition3\u21924 (array3 to array4):\n\narray4's zeros are4,9. \n\narray3's zeros were0-1,4-5,8-9,12-13. \n\nSo array4 removes zeros except4 and9. No new groups added. But this is a removal, not addition. How to handle this? If the output is about added groups, this would be 0. But no examples have zero.\n\nBut looking at Example3's output:\n\nExample3's input transitions involve arrays where zeros are added and removed. For instance, the second transition in Example3:\n\narray3 is [5,5,5,5,0,5,0,0,5,0,5,5,5,5].\n\narray4 is the same as array3. So no new groups added. Output is [2,2,2]. Doesn't fit.\n\nThis suggests that the pattern is not solely based on new zero groups added.\n\nAnother angle: Maybe the output numbers correspond to the number of \"holes\" (groups of zeros) in each array. For example, array2 in Example0's first transition has three groups of zeros (positions4,6-7,9-10,13). Wait, array2's zeros are at4,6,7,9,10,13. These form groups at4 (single),6-7 (two),9-10 (two),13 (single). So four groups. Output is [2,2,2]. Not matching.\n\nAlternatively, the number of groups of zeros in the array. For array2 in Example0: four groups. Output is 2. Doesn't fit.\n\nThis is really challenging. Let's try to think of a different approach.\n\nLooking at Example0's output again:\n\nOutputs are [2,2,2], [8,8,8], [3,3,3].\n\nWhat's special about these numbers? 2+8+3=13. Not sure. 2*8=16, 16+3=19. No.\n\nLooking at the Test Input's transitions:\n\nTransition1\u21922: new zeros at5,8,12,13. These are four positions.\n\nIf the output is the number of new zeros divided by 2, then 4/2=2. So output [2,2,2].\n\nTransition2\u21923: new zeros at0,1. Two new zeros. Divided by 1 \u2192 2. But no examples have 2 in such a case. Example1's first transition had two new zeros and output [3,3,3].\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is the number of 5s that are surrounded by 0s. For example, in array2 of Example0's first transition, the 5 at position8 is surrounded by zeros. Let's check:\n\narray2's 5 at position8: previous element is 0 (position7), next is 0 (position9). So it's a single 5 surrounded by zeros. How many such cases are there?\n\nIn array2 of Example0:\n\n- Position5: 5 followed by 0 (position6). But preceded by 0 (position4). So surrounded by zeros? Yes. So position5 is a single 5 between zeros.\n\n- Position8: 5 between zeros (positions7 and9).\n\n- Position11: 5 preceded by 0 (position10) and followed by 5 (position12). Not surrounded by zeros.\n\nSo two 5s surrounded by zeros. Output is [2,2,2]. This fits.\n\nLet's check Example0's first transition output:\n\narray2 has two 5s surrounded by zeros. Output [2,2,2].\n\narray3 in Example0 is the same as array2, so same count. Then array4 in Example0's third transition is:\n\n[5,5,5,5,0,5,5,5,5,0,5,5,5,5]. No 5s surrounded by zeros. So count is 0. But output is [3,3,3]. Doesn't fit.\n\nBut maybe the count of such 5s is part of the pattern.\n\nExample0's third transition (array3 to array4):\n\narray4 has no surrounded 5s. So count is 0. But output is [3,3,3]. Doesn't fit.\n\nSo this theory is incorrect.\n\nAnother idea: the output numbers could represent the number of times a 5 is followed by a 0 in the array. For array2 in Example0's first transition:\n\nIndices where 5 is followed by 0:\n\n5\u21926: 5 to 0 (index5\u21926)\n\n7\u21928: 0 to 5 (not counted)\n\n8\u21929:5 to 0 (index8\u21929)\n\n10\u219211:0 to 5 (not counted)\n\n12\u219213:5 to 0 (index12\u219213)\n\nSo three occurrences. Output is [2,2,2]. Doesn't fit.\n\nI'm really stuck. Let's try to look for another pattern in the examples.\n\nIn Example0's output:\n\n[2,2,2]\n\n[8,8,8]\n\n[3,3,3]\n\nWhat if each number represents the number of 5s in the array multiplied by some factor? For example:\n\narray2 in Example0's first transition has 4+1+1+2 =8 5s. Output is 8. Which matches the second line. array3 is same as array2, so output also 8. array4 has 4+4+4=12 5s. 12 mod 9 is 3. Output is3. So the second line is the sum of 5s, the third line is sum mod 9. But the first line is2, which doesn't fit this.\n\nExample0's array1 has 12 fives. 12 mod 9 is3. But output is2. Doesn't fit.\n\nAnother idea: the sum of the lengths of all 5s groups. For array2 in Example0's first transition, sum is4+1+1+2=8. Output is8. For array3 (same as array2), sum is8. For array4, sum is4+4+4=12. 12 mod 10 is2, but output is3.\n\nBut Example0's third transition output is3. Doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, the sum of the lengths divided by 2. 8/2=4, but output is3. No.\n\nI'm really struggling here. Maybe I should look at the Test Input's transitions and try to see what the output would be based on possible patterns.\n\nTest Input transitions:\n\nTransition1\u21922 (array1 to array2):\n\narray1: zeros at4,9.\n\narray2: zeros at4,5,8,9,12,13.\n\nNew zeros added at5,8,12,13.\n\nThese are four new zeros. If output is 4/2=2, then [2,2,2].\n\nTransition2\u21923 (array2 to array3):\n\narray3's zeros are0,1,4,5,8,9,12,13.\n\nNew zeros added at0,1.\n\nTwo new zeros. Divided by 2 gives 1. But previous examples have outputs like 3,4, etc. Alternatively, if it's the number of new zero groups added. array2 has zeros in groups4-5,8-9,12-13. array3 adds zeros at0-1. So one new group. Output would be [1,1,1].\n\nTransition3\u21924 (array3 to array4):\n\narray4's zeros are4,9.\n\narray3's zeros are0-1,4-5,8-9,12-13.\n\nSo array4 removes zeros. New zeros added: none. But output might be based on the remaining zeros. The number of zero groups in array4 is two (4 and9). So output could be 2. So third transition output [2,2,2].\n\nPutting it all together, the outputs would be:\n\n[2,2,2]\n\n[1,1,1]\n\n[2,2,2]\n\nBut looking at the training examples, Example3's output has [2,4,2]. So maybe this is plausible. But I'm not confident.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each output line is the count of zero groups in the array after the transition. For Test Input's transitions:\n\nTransition1\u21922: array2 has three zero groups (4-5,8-9,12-13). So output [3,3,3].\n\nTransition2\u21923: array3 has four zero groups (0-1,4-5,8-9,12-13). Output [4,4,4].\n\nTransition3\u21924: array4 has two zero groups (4 and9). Output [2,2,2].\n\nThis matches the structure of some training examples. For instance, Example1's outputs are [3,3,3], [4,4,4], [2,2,2], which correspond to the number of zero groups in the array after each transition.\n\nIn Example1's transitions:\n\nTransition1\u21922: array2 has three zero groups (0,3,4,9 \u2192 groups at0,3-4,9). Wait, array2 is [0,5,5,0,0,5,5,5,5,0,5,5,5,5]. Zeros are at0,3,4,9. Groups are0 (single),3-4 (two),9 (single). Total three groups. So output [3,3,3].\n\nTransition2\u21923: array3 is [0,5,5,0,0,5,0,0,5,0,5,5,5,5]. Zeros at0,3-4,6-7,9. So four groups. Output [4,4,4].\n\nTransition3\u21924: array4 is [5,5,5,5,0,5,0,0,5,0,5,5,5,5]. Zeros at4,6-7,9. Three groups. But Example1's output is [2,2,2]. Doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. So that theory doesn't hold for Example1's third transition.\n\nAnother training example, Example2:\n\nOutputs: [8,8,8], [2,2,2], [4,4,4]\n\nAssuming outputs are the number of zero groups:\n\nIn Example2's transitions:\n\nTransition1\u21922: array2's zeros could have two groups. Output is8. Doesn't fit.\n\nThis suggests the theory is incorrect.\n\nI think I've exhausted most possibilities. Given the time I've spent and the lack of a clear pattern, I'll make an educated guess based on the Test Input's transitions possibly following the pattern of counting new zero groups added, leading to the outputs:\n\nFor Test Input:\n\nTransition1\u21922: new zero groups added three (4-5, 8-9,12-13) \u2192 output [3,3,3].\n\nTransition2\u21923: new zero groups added one (0-1) \u2192 output [1,1,1].\n\nTransition3\u21924: new zero groups added zero (but removed many) \u2192 output [2,2,2] (as array4 has two zero groups).\n\nBut how does this align with the training examples?\n\nAlternatively, based on the Test Input's array4 zeros at4 and9 (two groups), output could be [2,2,2].\n\nBut I'm not sure. Given the time constraints, I'll proceed with the following answer based on the pattern observed in some examples where the output corresponds to the number of zero groups in the array after the transition:\n\nTest Input transitions:\n\n1\u21922: array2 has three zero groups \u2192 [3,3,3].\n\n2\u21923: array3 has four zero groups \u2192 [4,4,4].\n\n3\u21924: array4 has two zero groups \u2192 [2,2,2].\n\nSo the output would be:\n\n[3,3,3]\n\n[4,4,4]\n\n[2,2,2]\n\nBut looking back at Example1's outputs, which include [3,3,3], [4,4,4], and [2,2,2], this could be plausible. However, in Example0's first transition, array2 has four zero groups but the output is [2,2,2], which contradicts this theory. So this might not be correct.\n\nAnother possible pattern is the sum of the lengths of the zero groups in the array after the transition. For example, in array2 of Test Input's first transition:\n\nZero groups are4-5 (length2),8-9 (2),12-13 (2). Sum is2+2+2=6. But output would be6, which doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, sum divided by 2: 6/2=3. Output [3,3,3]. Then array3's zero groups sum to 0-1 (2),4-5 (2),8-9 (2),12-13 (2). Sum 8. Divided by 2 is4. Output [4,4,4]. Array4's zero groups sum 1+1=2. Divided by 2 is1. But previous examples don't support this.\n\nGiven the uncertainty, and considering the limited time, I'll make a guess that the outputs are [3,3,3], [4,4,4], [2,2,2] based on zero group counts."
