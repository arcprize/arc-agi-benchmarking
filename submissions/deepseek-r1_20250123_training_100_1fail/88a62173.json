        "cot_1": "Okay, let's see. I need to figure out the pattern here based on the training examples and then apply it to the test input. Let's start by looking at the examples one by one.\n\nStarting with Example 0. The input is a 5x5 grid. The output is two rows, each with two elements. Let's look at the input rows:\n\nOriginal input rows:\n[0, 2, 0, 0, 2]\n[2, 2, 0, 2, 2]\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[0, 2, 0, 2, 2]\n[2, 2, 0, 2, 0]\n\nOutput:\n[2, 2]\n[2, 0]\n\nHmm. Maybe the output is formed from certain positions in the input. Let me check the positions. For example, the first output row is [2,2]. Let's see where those numbers might come from. Looking at the first input row: [0,2,0,0,2]. The second element is 2, fifth is 2. But the output here is [2,2]. Wait, maybe it's not the same row. Let's check the other rows. The second input row is [2,2,0,2,2]. The first two elements are 2,2. But the output's first row is [2,2], which matches. Then the output's second row is [2,0]. Let's see if that's from another row. The fifth input row is [2,2,0,2,0]. The last two elements here are 2 and 0. So maybe the output takes the first two elements from the second row and the last two from the fifth row. But that's just a guess. Let me check the next example to see if this pattern holds.\n\nExample 1's input:\n\n[1, 0, 0, 1, 0]\n[0, 1, 0, 0, 1]\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[1, 0, 0, 1, 0]\n[1, 1, 0, 0, 1]\n\nOutput is [1,0] and [1,1]. Let's see. The second input row here is [0,1,0,0,1]. First two elements are 0,1. But the output's first row is [1,0]. Wait, that doesn't match. Alternatively, maybe it's the fourth row. The fourth input row is [1,0,0,1,0]. First two elements 1,0. That matches the first output row [1,0]. Then the fifth input row is [1,1,0,0,1]. The last two elements are 0,1. But the output's second row is [1,1]. Hmm, maybe not. Alternatively, maybe the output rows are combining elements from different positions. Let's think of other possibilities.\n\nLooking at Example 0's output again: [2,2] and [2,0]. The first output row could be the first two elements of the second input row (which is [2,2,0,2,2], so first two 2,2). The second output row [2,0] could be the last two elements of the fifth input row [2, 2, 0, 2, 0], which are 2 and 0. That seems to fit. Let's check Example 1:\n\nSecond input row is [0,1,0,0,1]. If we take first two elements here (0,1), but the first output row is [1,0]. Wait, that doesn't match. Alternatively, maybe the fourth row's first two elements. The fourth input row is [1,0,0,1,0], first two elements 1,0, which matches the first output row [1,0]. Then the fifth row's last two elements: fifth input row is [1,1,0,0,1], last two elements 0,1. But the output's second row is [1,1]. Hmm, that doesn't match. So maybe not that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is formed by taking the first and last elements of certain rows. Let's check Example 0's output again. First output row [2,2]. Maybe from the second input row's first element (2) and fifth element (2), giving 2 and 2. Then the second output row [2,0] could be from the fifth input row's first and fifth elements: 2 and 0. That works. Let's check Example 1. The output is [1,0] and [1,1]. The first output row [1,0] could be from the first input row's first and fifth elements: 1 and 0. Then the second output row [1,1] could be from the fifth input row's first and fifth elements: 1 and 1. That fits. Let's check:\n\nExample 0's first output row: second input row's first and fifth elements: 2 and 2. Wait, second input row is [2,2,0,2,2], so first and fifth are 2 and 2. So output [2,2]. Then fifth row's first and fifth: 2 and 0 \u2192 [2,0]. That matches.\n\nExample 1: first output row [1,0] \u2192 first input row's first and fifth elements: 1 and 0. Fifth input row's first and fifth: 1 and 1 \u2192 [1,1]. That matches.\n\nExample 2's input:\n\n[8,8,0,0,8]\n[8,0,0,8,0]\n[0,0,0,0,0]\n[8,8,0,8,8]\n[8,0,0,8,0]\n\nOutput is [0,8] and [8,0]. Let's apply the same logic. The first output row [0,8] would be from first input row's first and fifth elements: 8 and 8? Wait, the first input row is [8,8,0,0,8]. First element is 8, fifth is 8. But the output is [0,8]. Hmm, that doesn't fit. Wait, maybe not the first input row. Alternatively, perhaps the fourth input row's first and fifth elements. Fourth input row is [8,8,0,8,8]. First is 8, fifth is 8. That would give [8,8], which isn't the output. So maybe this approach is incorrect.\n\nWait, the output here is [0,8] and [8,0]. Let's check the input rows again. Let's look for rows where the first and fifth elements are 0 and 8. Let's see:\n\nThird row is [0,0,0,0,0]. First and fifth are 0 and 0. Not matching. The second input row is [8,0,0,8,0]. First is 8, fifth is 0. So if we take first and fifth, we get 8 and 0. But the output's second row here is [8,0]. So maybe in this example, the first output row is from the third row? But third row's first and fifth are 0,0. But output is [0,8]. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is taking the middle row (third row, which is all zeros) and then some other rows. But in Example 0, the third row is all zeros as well, but the outputs are not all zeros.\n\nThis suggests that the pattern isn't simply taking the first and fifth elements of specific rows. Let's think differently.\n\nAnother approach: maybe the output is formed by looking at the non-zero elements in specific positions across the input rows. For example, in Example 0, the output rows are [2,2] and [2,0]. Let's see the input rows again:\n\nOriginal input rows for Example 0:\n\nRow 0: [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]\nRow 1: [2, 2, 0, 2, 2]\nRow 2: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\nRow 3: [0, 2, 0, 2, 2]\nRow 4: [2, 2, 0, 2, 0]\n\nIf we look at columns, perhaps? The output is two rows, each with two elements. Maybe the columns where the output is taken. Let's see. For Example 0's output:\n\nFirst output row [2,2] could be column 0 and 4. Let's check:\n\nRow 1, column 0 is 2, column 4 is 2. So [2,2].\n\nRow 4, column 0 is 2, column 4 is 0. So [2,0]. That matches the output. So maybe the output is taking the first and fifth elements (indices 0 and 4) of rows 1 and 4.\n\nIn Example 1:\n\nInput rows:\n\nRow 0: [1,0,0,1,0]\nRow 1: [0,1,0,0,1]\nRow 2: [0,0,0,0,0]\nRow 3: [1,0,0,1,0]\nRow 4: [1,1,0,0,1]\n\nOutput is [1,0] and [1,1].\n\nIf we take row 0's first and fifth elements: 1 and 0 \u2192 [1,0]. Then row 4's first and fifth: 1 and 1 \u2192 [1,1]. That matches the output.\n\nExample 2's input:\n\nRow 0: [8,8,0,0,8]\nRow 1: [8,0,0,8,0]\nRow 2: [0,0,0,0,0]\nRow 3: [8,8,0,8,8]\nRow 4: [8,0,0,8,0]\n\nOutput is [0,8] and [8,0]. Let's see. Taking row 1's first and fifth elements: 8 and 0 \u2192 [8,0]. But the output's second row is [8,0]. Hmm. Then where does [0,8] come from? If we take row 0's first and fifth elements: 8 and 8 \u2192 [8,8], which isn't the output. Wait, maybe this approach isn't correct for Example 2.\n\nWait the output for Example 2 is [0,8] and [8,0]. If we look at row 3's first and fifth: 8 and 8. Not matching. Row 4's first and fifth: 8 and 0 \u2192 [8,0], which is the second output row. How about row 2? It's all zeros, first and fifth elements 0 and 0. But the output's first row is [0,8]. So that doesn't fit. Hmm. So maybe the pattern isn't the same here. Alternatively, maybe there's another way.\n\nWait, maybe the output is taking rows 1 and 4's first and fifth elements. For Example 0: rows 1 and 4. For Example 1: rows 0 and 4. For Example 2: rows 1 and 4. Let's check:\n\nExample 2's output is [0,8] and [8,0]. If we take row 1 and row 4:\n\nRow1's first and fifth: 8 and 0 \u2192 [8,0] (which is the second output row here). Row4's first and fifth:8 and 0 \u2192 [8,0], but the first output row is [0,8]. Doesn't match. So that can't be.\n\nAlternative approach: Maybe the output rows are formed by the second and fourth rows of the input. Let's check Example 0's input:\n\nRow 1 (second row) is [2,2,0,2,2]. Maybe taking elements from here. But output is [2,2] and [2,0]. Maybe the first output row is the first two elements of row 1: 2,2. The second output row is the last two elements of row4: 2,0. Then for Example 1:\n\nRow1 is [0,1,0,0,1]. First two elements 0,1. But output's first row is [1,0]. Doesn't fit. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the first and last elements of rows 0 and 3. Let's check Example 0:\n\nRow0's first and last: 0 and 2. Not matching the output. Row3's first and last: 0 and 2. So maybe not.\n\nAnother angle: The output has two rows, each with two elements. The input has 5 rows, and the third row is all zeros. Maybe the output is formed from the non-zero rows, excluding the middle (third) zero row, and combining certain elements. For example, in Example 0, the input has rows 0,1,3,4 (excluding row 2). Then perhaps take the first two elements of the first non-middle row and the last two elements of another row.\n\nWait, perhaps the output rows are the first two elements of the second input row and the last two elements of the fifth input row. In Example 0:\n\nSecond input row (index 1) is [2,2,0,2,2]. First two elements: 2,2 \u2192 first output row. Fifth input row (index4) is [2,2,0,2,0]. Last two elements: 2,0 \u2192 second output row. That fits.\n\nIn Example 1:\n\nSecond input row (index1) is [0,1,0,0,1]. First two elements: 0,1. But output's first row is [1,0]. Not matching. Wait that's a problem. Alternatively, perhaps it's the fourth row's first two elements. Example1's fourth row (index3) is [1,0,0,1,0]. First two:1,0 \u2192 matches output's first row. Fifth row (index4) is [1,1,0,0,1]. Last two elements:0,1. But the output's second row is [1,1]. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is first two elements of the fourth row and last two of the fifth row. For Example1:\n\nFourth row (index3): first two 1,0 \u2192 [1,0]. Fifth row (index4): last two 0,1 \u2192 but output is [1,1]. Doesn't fit. Hmm.\n\nThis is getting a bit confusing. Let me try another approach. Let's look for patterns in the output.\n\nIn Example0, the output has two rows. Each output row is two elements. The elements in the output rows are present in the input rows. For example, 2,2 and 2,0.\n\nIn Example1, the outputs are 1,0 and 1,1.\n\nIn Example2, the outputs are 0,8 and 8,0.\n\nWait, Example2's output [0,8] isn't present as a consecutive pair in the input. Let's look at the input rows for Example2:\n\nRow0: [8,8,0,0,8]\nRow1: [8,0,0,8,0]\nRow3: [8,8,0,8,8]\nRow4: [8,0,0,8,0]\n\nSo where does [0,8] come from? The only 0 followed by 8 is in row0's third and fourth elements: 0,0, but not 8. Wait, row0's fourth element is 0, fifth is 8. So indices 3 and 4 are 0 and 8. So maybe taking elements from certain positions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is taking the third and fourth elements of row0 and row1. For Example2's output:\n\nRow0's third and fourth elements:0 and 0. No. Row1's third and fourth:0 and8. So 0,8. That matches the first output row. Then row4's third and fourth:0 and8. So 0,8. But the second output row is [8,0]. Hmm, maybe row4's fourth and fifth elements:8 and0 \u2192 which would give [8,0]. That matches the second output row. So for Example2, first output row is third and fourth elements of row1, and second output row is fourth and fifth elements of row4. \n\nLet's check that pattern across examples.\n\nExample0:\n\nInput rows:\n\nRow0: [0,2,0,0,2]\nRow1: [2,2,0,2,2]\nRow4: [2,2,0,2,0]\n\nIf we take row1's third and fourth elements:0 and2. But output is [2,2]. Doesn't fit. So maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is made by taking elements from the second and fourth rows. For Example2's output:\n\nFirst output row [0,8] is from row1's third and fourth elements:0 and8. Second output row [8,0] is from row4's fourth and fifth:8 and0.\n\nBut how does this apply to the other examples?\n\nExample0's output:\n\nFirst output row [2,2]. If we take row1's first two elements:2,2. Second output row [2,0] could be row4's fourth and fifth elements:2,0. But how?\n\nThis inconsistency makes me think maybe there's another pattern.\n\nAlternative idea: The output consists of two rows, each being the first two elements of a certain row and the last two elements of another. Or perhaps the output is formed by combining elements from the first and last rows in a specific way.\n\nAnother approach: Looking at the position of the numbers in the output. For Example0's output, the first element is 2, which appears in the second row's first position, and the second element is 2 from the second row's second position. The second output row's first element is 2 (fourth row's first element?), but no. Let's see:\n\nAnother observation: In all three examples, the middle row (third row) is all zeros. So maybe the middle row is irrelevant, and the output is derived from the other four rows. Perhaps the output is combining elements from the first and fourth rows, and the second and fifth rows.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking the non-zero elements from the first and last positions of the non-middle rows.\n\nBut I'm not making progress here. Let me try to tabulate the positions for each example.\n\nExample0:\n\nInput Rows (excluding middle row):\n\nRow0: [0,2,0,0,2]\nRow1: [2,2,0,2,2]\nRow3: [0,2,0,2,2]\nRow4: [2,2,0,2,0]\n\nOutput rows:\n\n[2,2] and [2,0]\n\nPossible sources:\n\n[2,2] could be from Row1's first two elements (2,2). [2,0] could be from Row4's fourth and fifth elements (2,0). Alternatively, Row4's last two elements are 2 and0.\n\nIn Example1:\n\nInput rows (excluding middle):\n\nRow0: [1,0,0,1,0]\nRow1: [0,1,0,0,1]\nRow3: [1,0,0,1,0]\nRow4: [1,1,0,0,1]\n\nOutput: [1,0], [1,1]\n\n[1,0] is from Row0's first and fifth elements (1 and0). [1,1] is from Row4's first and second elements (1,1).\n\nExample2:\n\nInput rows:\n\nRow0: [8,8,0,0,8]\nRow1: [8,0,0,8,0]\nRow3: [8,8,0,8,8]\nRow4: [8,0,0,8,0]\n\nOutput: [0,8] and [8,0]\n\n[0,8] could be from Row1's third and fourth elements (0,8). [8,0] from Row4's fourth and fifth (8,0).\n\nBut this seems inconsistent. So perhaps the pattern is:\n\nFor each output row, take elements from the middle column and some other column? Let's check.\n\nThe middle column is index 2, which is 0 in all input rows. So that's not helpful.\n\nAnother angle: The output rows are of length 2, which might correspond to the first and last elements of certain rows. For example:\n\nExample0's output rows: [2,2] could be row1's first and last (2 and2). [2,0] could be row4's first and last (2 and0). That matches.\n\nExample1's output rows: [1,0] is row0's first and last (1 and0). [1,1] is row4's first and last (1 and1). That matches.\n\nExample2's output rows: [0,8] would be row0's first and last are 8 and8. Doesn't fit. But wait the output is [0,8]. So maybe row1's first and last: row1's first is8, last is0 \u2192 [8,0]. Which would be the second output row. Hmm. Then where does [0,8] come from?\n\nWait in Example2's output, first row is [0,8]. Let's look for a row whose first and last elements are 0 and8. Looking at the input rows for Example2:\n\nRow0: first 8, last 8 \u2192 [8,8]. No.\n\nRow1: first 8, last0 \u2192 [8,0]. But the output's second row is [8,0], which would fit. The first output row is [0,8], which would require a row with first element 0 and last element8. Looking at the input rows, row2 is all zeros, but first and last are0,0. Row3's first and last are8,8. Row4's first and last are8 and0. So there's no row with first 0 and last8. So this pattern doesn't work for Example2.\n\nHmm. Maybe the pattern is different. Let me think again.\n\nLooking back, in all training examples, the output has two rows. Each output row is formed by taking the first element of one input row and the last element of another input row. For Example0, output rows:\n\n[2,2] \u2192 first element from row1 (2) and last element from row1 (2). [2,0] \u2192 first element from row4 (2) and last element from row4 (0). So each output row is first and last elements of the same row. For Example0, rows1 and4.\n\nExample1's output rows: [1,0] \u2192 first and last of row0 (1,0). [1,1] \u2192 first and last of row4 (1,1).\n\nExample2's output rows: [0,8] \u2192 but which row has first 0 and last8? Only row0 has last8. Row0's first is8, so that doesn't fit. So this approach doesn't explain Example2.\n\nAlternative possibility: The first output row is the first element of the second row and the last element of the fourth row, and the second output row is the first element of the fourth row and the last element of the fifth row.\n\nExample0:\n\nRow1 first element 2, row3 last element 2 \u2192 [2,2]. Row4 first 2, row4 last 0 \u2192 [2,0]. That fits.\n\nExample1:\n\nRow1 first 0, row3 last 0 \u2192 [0,0]. Doesn't fit. So no.\n\nThis is getting too complicated. Let's think of another angle.\n\nLooking at the outputs:\n\nExample0's output has two rows. The first row is [2,2], which appears as the first two elements of row1. The second row is [2,0], which are the first and last elements of row4.\n\nExample1's output first row [1,0] is the first and last elements of row0. Second row [1,1] is first and second elements of row4.\n\nExample2's output first row [0,8] is third and fourth elements of row1 (which are 0 and8). Second row [8,0] is first and last elements of row4 (8 and0).\n\nThis inconsistency suggests the pattern might be different.\n\nWait, another approach: the output rows are derived from columns. For example, looking at the columns of the input and selecting certain columns.\n\nExample0's input columns:\n\nColumn0: [0,2,0,0,2]\nColumn1: [2,2,0,2,2]\nColumn2: [0,0,0,0,0]\nColumn3: [0,2,0,2,2]\nColumn4: [2,2,0,2,0]\n\nBut the output has two rows. Maybe columns 1 and 3? Let's see. For Example0, column1 has elements [2,2,0,2,2], and column3 has [0,2,0,2,2]. If we take the first two non-zero elements from each, but not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is the transpose of certain columns. Not sure.\n\nAnother idea: The output could be the first and last non-zero elements in each of the top and bottom rows. For example, in Example0:\n\nRow0 has non-zero elements at positions 1 and4 (2 and2). But output's first row is [2,2]. So maybe the first output row is the non-zero elements from row1. Row1 has non-zero elements at positions0,1,3,4. So first two are 2,2. The output's first row is [2,2]. The second output row is [2,0], which could be from row4's non-zero elements: positions0,1,3 (2,2,2), but last two are 2 and0. Hmm, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the output is formed by the first two non-zero elements from certain rows. For Example0's first output row [2,2] from row1's elements. But row1 has first two 2,2. For Example1's first output row [1,0], which is from row0's first and fourth elements (1,1?), no. This is getting frustrating.\n\nWait, let's look at the number of elements in the output. Each output row has two elements. The inputs have 5 elements per row. Maybe the output is taking elements from the second and fourth columns of certain rows. Let's check Example0:\n\nRow1's second and fourth columns: 2 and2 \u2192 [2,2]. Row4's second and fourth columns:2 and2 \u2192 [2,2]. But the output's second row is [2,0]. Doesn't fit. \n\nAlternatively, maybe columns 1 and 3. For row1, columns1 and3 are2 and2 \u2192 [2,2]. For row4, columns1 and3 are2 and2 \u2192 [2,2]. Again, not matching the output.\n\nAnother thought: Maybe the output is derived from the diagonals of the input matrix. For Example0's input:\n\nThe main diagonal (top-left to bottom-right) would be 0,2,0,2,0. The anti-diagonal (top-right to bottom-left) is 2,2,0,2,2. But the output rows don't match this.\n\nAlternatively, the sum of certain rows or columns. But the outputs are specific numbers, not sums.\n\nWait, let me think of the structure. Each input is a 5x5 grid. The output is a 2x2 grid. How to reduce 5x5 to 2x2?\n\nAnother idea: The output is formed by combining the first two elements of the second row and the last two elements of the fifth row.\n\nExample0:\n\nRow1 (second row) first two:2,2 \u2192 first output row.\n\nRow4 (fifth row) last two:2,0 \u2192 second output row. That fits.\n\nExample1:\n\nRow1's first two:0,1 \u2192 output first row is [1,0]. Doesn't match. So no.\n\nExample2:\n\nRow1's first two:8,0 \u2192 output first row [0,8]. Doesn't fit.\n\nThis approach works for Example0 but not the others. So maybe not.\n\nAnother possibility: The output is the two middle elements of the first and fourth rows. For Example0's first row: [0,2,0,0,2], middle elements are positions 2, which is 0. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is the first and fifth elements of the second and fourth rows.\n\nExample0:\n\nRow1: first 2, fifth 2 \u2192 [2,2]. Row3: first 0, fifth 2 \u2192 [0,2]. But output is [2,2] and [2,0]. Doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. Let's try a different approach. Maybe the output is formed by the two elements that are in positions where the column sums are maximum or minimum. But I need to check.\n\nExample0's input columns:\n\nColumn0: 0+2+0+0+2=4\n\nColumn1:2+2+0+2+2=8\n\nColumn2: all zeros.\n\nColumn3:0+2+0+2+2=6\n\nColumn4:2+2+0+2+0=6\n\nSo columns 1 has the highest sum. Maybe the output takes elements from the columns with highest sums. For Example0's output [2,2] and [2,0], which are in column1 and column0 or4.\n\nNot sure.\n\nAlternatively, looking for pairs that appear in the input.\n\nIn Example0, [2,2] appears in row1 and row3. [2,0] appears in row4.\n\nIn Example1, [1,0] is in row0 and row3. [1,1] is in row4.\n\nIn Example2, [0,8] is in row1's third and fourth elements. [8,0] is in row1's first and last elements and row4's first and last.\n\nBut I'm not seeing a clear pattern here.\n\nWait, another idea: the output is the first two elements of the second row and the last two elements of the fifth row. Let's check:\n\nExample0:\n\nRow1 (second row) first two:2,2 \u2192 [2,2]. Row4 (fifth row) last two:2,0 \u2192 [2,0]. This matches.\n\nExample1:\n\nRow1's first two:0,1. Output first row is [1,0]. Not matching. So maybe reversed. So the output takes row1's first two elements but reversed. For Example1, 0,1 reversed becomes 1,0 \u2192 matches the first output row. Row4's last two elements:0,1 \u2192 reversed 1,0. But the output's second row is [1,1]. So this doesn't work.\n\nExample2:\n\nRow1's first two elements:8,0 \u2192 reversed 0,8 \u2192 matches the first output row. Row4's last two:8,0 \u2192 reversed 0,8. But the output's second row is [8,0]. Hmm. So if we take row1's first two elements reversed and row4's last two elements not reversed. Doesn't fit.\n\nThis pattern works for Example0 and Example2 but not for Example1. So maybe not.\n\nAnother approach: The output is the two elements that are unique or appear least frequently in the input rows. For Example0, 2 appears multiple times. The output has 2 and 0. Maybe not.\n\nAlternative idea: The output rows correspond to the second and fourth rows of the input, but transformed. For Example0:\n\nRow1: [2,2,0,2,2] \u2192 take first two elements \u2192 [2,2] (first output row). Row3: [0,2,0,2,2] \u2192 take last two elements \u2192 [2,2]. But output's second row is [2,0]. Doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, for Example0, row1 and row4 are selected. Row1's first two, row4's last two.\n\nExample0: works. Example1: row0 and row4. Row0's first two elements [1,0], row4's last two [0,1] reversed? But output is [1,0] and [1,1]. So maybe row0's first two and row4's first two.\n\nExample1's row4 first two:1,1 \u2192 [1,1], which is the second output row. So first output row is row0's first two, second output row is row4's first two. But row0's first two are [1,0], which matches the first output row. Row4's first two are [1,1], which matches the second output row. This fits.\n\nExample2's output would then be row0's first two and row4's first two. Row0's first two:8,8 \u2192 output should be [8,8], but the output is [0,8]. Doesn't fit. So this pattern works for Examples0 and1 but not2.\n\nWait, Example2's output is [0,8] and [8,0]. If we take row1's first two elements:8,0 \u2192 reversed would be0,8. And row4's first two:8,0 \u2192 reversed is0,8. But the output's second row is [8,0]. So maybe not.\n\nThis is really tricky. Let's look at the test input and see if any patterns from the examples can be applied.\n\nTest Input:\n\n[5,5,0,5,0]\n[0,5,0,0,5]\n[0,0,0,0,0]\n[5,5,0,5,5]\n[0,5,0,0,5]\n\nIf the pattern from Example0 and Example1 is to take the first two elements of the first row and the first two of the fifth row, then:\n\nFirst output row: [5,5] from row0.\n\nSecond output row: [0,5] from row4's first two elements.\n\nBut the example outputs don't align with that. For instance, in Example2, the first output row is [0,8], which would require taking row1's first two elements (8,0) reversed. If that's the pattern for Example2, then for the test input, row1's first two are0,5. Reversed would be5,0. Then the output's first row would be [5,0]. Second row could be row4's first two:0,5 \u2192 reversed would be5,0. But that would give [5,0] and [5,0], which doesn't match the examples.\n\nAlternatively, if the output is taking the first and fifth elements of row0 and row4:\n\nRow0: first 5, fifth 0 \u2192 [5,0].\n\nRow4: first 0, fifth5 \u2192 [0,5]. So output would be [5,0] and [0,5]. But the training examples don't fit this pattern. For example, Example0's output would be row0:0 and2 \u2192 [0,2], which is not the case. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAnother possibility: The output is the third and fourth elements of row1 and row4. For the test input:\n\nRow1: [0,5,0,0,5]. Third and fourth elements:0,0. So [0,0]. Row4: [0,5,0,0,5]. Third and fourth:0,0. Output would be [0,0], [0,0]. Not matching.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is formed by taking the first and last elements of the second and fourth rows. For the test input:\n\nRow1 (second row) first is0, last is5 \u2192 [0,5].\n\nRow3 (fourth row) first is5, last is5 \u2192 [5,5]. But the output examples for the training data don't align with this. For example, Example0's row1 first and last are2 and2 \u2192 [2,2], which matches the first output row. Row3's first and last are0 and2 \u2192 [0,2], but the output's second row is [2,0]. So that doesn't fit.\n\nThis is really challenging. Let me try to find another pattern.\n\nLooking back at the outputs:\n\nExample0: output rows are [2,2] and [2,0].\n\nExample1: [1,0] and [1,1].\n\nExample2: [0,8] and [8,0].\n\nNotice that in each example, the first element of the first output row is the same as the first element of the second output row. Only in Example0 this is true (both start with 2). In Example1, first output row starts with1, second with1. Example2: first starts with0, second with8. So that's not consistent.\n\nAnother observation: In Example0 and Example1, the first output row is the first two elements of the first non-zero row (row0 in Example1, row1 in Example0). Then the second output row is the first two elements of the last row (row4 in both examples). For Example0, row1's first two are2,2 \u2192 output first row. row4's first two are2,2 \u2192 but output's second row is [2,0]. Doesn't fit.\n\nExample2's first output row is [0,8], which would come from row1's third and fourth elements:0 and8. Second output row is [8,0], from row4's first and last elements:0 and5? No.\n\nWait, perhaps the output is made by taking the elements from the first and fourth rows' second and fourth columns.\n\nExample0:\n\nRow0: second element 2, fourth 0 \u2192 [2,0]. Not matching.\n\nRow3: second 2, fourth 2 \u2192 [2,2]. So output would be [2,0], [2,2]. But the actual output is [2,2], [2,0]. So not matching.\n\nAlternatively, the second and fourth columns for row1 and row4.\n\nRow1: second 2, fourth 2 \u2192 [2,2].\n\nRow4: second 2, fourth 2 \u2192 [2,2]. Not matching output.\n\nI'm stuck. Maybe I need to look for another approach.\n\nLet me try to compare the input and output for each example directly.\n\nExample0 input:\n\nRows:\n\n0: [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]\n\n1: [2, 2, 0, 2, 2]\n\n2: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n3: [0, 2, 0, 2, 2]\n\n4: [2, 2, 0, 2, 0]\n\nOutput:\n\n[2,2]\n\n[2,0]\n\nLooking for [2,2] in the input. It appears in row1's first two elements, and row3's fourth and fifth elements (2,2). The first output row is [2,2], which matches row1's first two elements. Then [2,0] is row4's first and last elements (2,0). So maybe the output is first two of row1 and first and last of row4.\n\nExample1's input:\n\nRow0: [1,0,0,1,0]\n\nRow1: [0,1,0,0,1]\n\nRow3: [1,0,0,1,0]\n\nRow4: [1,1,0,0,1]\n\nOutput [1,0], [1,1]. These match row0's first two elements (1,0) and row4's first two (1,1).\n\nExample2's input:\n\nRow0: [8,8,0,0,8]\n\nRow1: [8,0,0,8,0]\n\nRow3: [8,8,0,8,8]\n\nRow4: [8,0,0,8,0]\n\nOutput [0,8], [8,0]. \n\nLooking for [0,8] in the input. It appears in row1's third and fourth elements (0,8). And [8,0] is row1's first and last elements (8,0) or row4's first and last (8,0). \n\nSo the pattern seems to be that the output rows are the first two elements of the first non-middle row and the first two of the last row for Examples0 and1, but for Example2, it's different. So this inconsistency makes it hard.\n\nBut maybe the pattern is that the first output row is the first two elements of the second row, and the second output row is the first two elements of the fifth row. But in Example1, that doesn't work.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output rows are the first two elements of the second row and the last two elements of the fifth row.\n\nExample0:\n\nRow1 first two:2,2 \u2192 [2,2]. Row4 last two:2,0 \u2192 [2,0]. Matches.\n\nExample1:\n\nRow1 first two:0,1. Output is [1,0]. So maybe reversed. So [0,1] reversed is [1,0], which matches the first output row. Row4's last two elements:0,1 \u2192 reversed [1,0]. But the output's second row is [1,1]. Doesn't fit.\n\nExample2:\n\nRow1's first two:8,0 \u2192 reversed [0,8] \u2192 matches first output row. Row4's last two:8,0 \u2192 reversed [0,8]. But output's second row is [8,0]. So no.\n\nThis pattern works for Example0 and Example2, but not Example1. \n\nWait, but in Example1, maybe the second output row is the first two elements of the fifth row. Fifth row's first two elements are1,1 \u2192 [1,1]. Which matches the second output row. But the first output row is [1,0], which is the first two elements of row0 (1,0). So perhaps the pattern is: the first output row is the first two elements of the first row (row0), and the second output row is the first two elements of the fifth row (row4).\n\nExample0: first row's first two are0,2 \u2192 output first row [2,2] (doesn't fit). So no.\n\nThis doesn't work for Example0.\n\nAlternative approach: Let's consider that in all examples, the output rows are the first two elements of the second input row and the last two elements of the fifth input row. \n\nExample0:\n\nRow1 first two:2,2 \u2192 [2,2]. Row4 last two:2,0 \u2192 [2,0]. Correct.\n\nExample1:\n\nRow1 first two:0,1 \u2192 reversed to [1,0]. Row4 last two:0,1 \u2192 reversed to [1,0]. But output is [1,0] and [1,1]. So only the first output row matches.\n\nExample2:\n\nRow1 first two:8,0 \u2192 reversed [0,8]. Row4 last two:8,0 \u2192 [8,0]. So output would be [0,8] and [8,0]. Which matches Example2's output.\n\nSo this pattern works for Example0 and Example2, but not for Example1. However, Example1's output could be explained if the first output row is the first two elements of row0 and the second is the first two of row4. \n\nBut how do we reconcile this inconsistency? Maybe the pattern is different for each example. But there must be a consistent rule.\n\nPerhaps the pattern is:\n\nThe first output row is the first two elements of the second input row (row1) if they are non-zero. Otherwise, take the first two elements of row0. Then the second output row is the last two elements of the fifth input row (row4).\n\nFor Example0:\n\nRow1 first two are non-zero (2,2) \u2192 [2,2]. Row4's last two are2,0 \u2192 [2,0]. Correct.\n\nExample1:\n\nRow1's first two elements are0 and1. Since 0 is present, maybe we take row0's first two:1,0 \u2192 [1,0]. Row4's last two:0,1 \u2192 but output is [1,1]. Doesn't fit.\n\nSo that doesn't work.\n\nAnother possibility: The first output row is formed by the first two elements of the first non-zero row, and the second output row is formed by the first two elements of the last non-zero row.\n\nExample0:\n\nFirst non-zero row is row0: first two elements0,2 \u2192 not. Maybe first non-zero row is row1 (since row0 starts with 0). So row1's first two:2,2 \u2192 first output row. Last non-zero row is row4 \u2192 first two:2,2. Output is [2,2], [2,0]. Doesn't fit.\n\nThis approach isn't working.\n\nAt this point, I'm struggling to find a pattern that fits all examples. Let's try to think of the test input and see if any of the possible patterns could apply.\n\nTest Input:\n\nRow0: [5,5,0,5,0]\n\nRow1: [0,5,0,0,5]\n\nRow2: all zeros.\n\nRow3: [5,5,0,5,5]\n\nRow4: [0,5,0,0,5]\n\nAssuming the pattern is to take the first two elements of row1 and the last two elements of row4.\n\nRow1's first two:0,5 \u2192 [0,5].\n\nRow4's last two:0,5 \u2192 [0,5]. So output would be:\n\n[0,5]\n\n[0,5]\n\nBut looking at the training examples, this doesn't match. But none of the training examples have this structure.\n\nAlternatively, if the pattern is taking the first two elements of row0 and row4:\n\nRow0's first two:5,5 \u2192 [5,5].\n\nRow4's first two:0,5 \u2192 [0,5]. But the training examples don't consistently follow this.\n\nExample1's first output row is [1,0], which is row0's first two elements. Second output row is [1,1], which is row4's first two. So perhaps this is the pattern.\n\nExample0's first output row is [2,2], which would be row1's first two. But according to this pattern, it should be row0's first two, which are0,2. Doesn't fit.\n\nThis inconsistency suggests that the pattern might be that the first output row is the first two elements of the row that starts with the highest number. For Example0, row1 starts with2, which is higher than row0's 0 and row3's 0, so first two elements of row1. Example1's row0 starts with1, which is higher than row1's 0, so first two elements of row0. Example2's row0 starts with8, but output is [0,8], which would suggest it's not. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAt this point, I'm stuck and need to make an educated guess based on the examples. Looking at the test input:\n\nRow0: [5,5,0,5,0]\n\nRow1: [0,5,0,0,5]\n\nRow3: [5,5,0,5,5]\n\nRow4: [0,5,0,0,5]\n\nIf the pattern is that the first output row is the first two elements of row3 and the second output row is the last two elements of row4:\n\nRow3's first two:5,5 \u2192 [5,5]. Row4's last two:0,5 \u2192 [0,5]. But the training examples don't support this.\n\nAlternatively, the pattern observed in Example2, where the output is the third and fourth elements of row1 and the fourth and fifth elements of row4:\n\nTest input's row1's third and fourth elements:0 and0 \u2192 [0,0]. Row4's fourth and fifth:0 and5 \u2192 [0,5]. Doesn't match any training example pattern.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and not finding a clear pattern, I'll have to go with the best guess. Based on Examples0 and1, the first output row is the first two elements of the first non-middle row (row0 for Example1, row1 for Example0), and the second output row is the first two elements of the fifth row (row4). For Example2, this doesn't fit, but maybe there's an exception.\n\nApplying this to the test input:\n\nFirst output row could be row0's first two elements:5,5.\n\nSecond output row could be row4's first two elements:0,5.\n\nBut the examples don't all align. Alternatively, if in the test input, the first output row is row3's first two elements:5,5. Second output row is row4's first two:0,5. But this is speculative.\n\nAlternatively, considering that in all examples, the output rows are derived from the first and fifth elements of certain rows. For Example0: row1 and row4. For Example1: row0 and row4. For Example2: row1 and row4.\n\nTest input: row1's first and fifth elements:0,5 \u2192 [0,5]. Row4's first and fifth:0,5 \u2192 [0,5]. So output would be [0,5] twice. But this doesn't match any example.\n\nAlternatively, taking row3's first and fifth (5,5) and row4's first and fifth (0,5). So output [5,5] and [0,5]. But I'm not sure.\n\nGiven the time constraints, I'll go with the pattern from Example0 and Example1, where the first output row is the first two elements of row0 and the second output row is the first two elements of row4. For the test input:\n\nRow0's first two:5,5 \u2192 [5,5].\n\nRow4's first two:0,5 \u2192 [0,5].\n\nBut in the training examples, Example0's row0's first two are0,2, and output is [2,2]. So this doesn't fit. Hence, this is incorrect.\n\nGiven that, the correct pattern might be taking the first two elements of row1 and the last two elements of row4.\n\nTest input:\n\nRow1's first two:0,5 \u2192 [0,5].\n\nRow4's last two:0,5 \u2192 [0,5]. Output would be two rows of [0,5]. But the examples don't support this.\n\nAlternatively, considering Example2's pattern: first output row is the third and fourth elements of row1 (0,0) and second output row is fourth and fifth elements of row4 (0,5). So [0,0] and [0,5]. Doesn't make sense.\n\nAnother possible pattern from Example2: output rows are the third and fourth elements of row1 and the fourth and fifth elements of row4. In test input, this would be 0,0 and0,5 \u2192 [0,0] and [0,5]. But the training example's output for Example2 is [0,8] and [8,0], which are row1's third and fourth elements (0,8) and row4's fourth and fifth (8,0). So maybe this pattern applies to the test input.\n\nTest input's row1: third and fourth elements are0 and0 \u2192 [0,0]. Row4's fourth and fifth:0 and5 \u2192 [0,5]. But this doesn't match any of the examples' outputs. However, in Example2, row1's third and fourth are0,8 \u2192 [0,8], and row4's fourth and fifth are8,0 \u2192 [8,0].\n\nSo applying this to the test input, the output would be:\n\n[0,0]\n\n[0,5]\n\nBut this doesn't match the examples' formats. \n\nGiven the time I've spent and the lack of a clear pattern, I'll make a guess based on the closest pattern that fits some examples. Since in Example0 and Example1, the first output row is the first two elements of row1 and row0, and the second output row is the first two elements of row4. However, for the test input:\n\nRow1's first two elements are0,5 \u2192 if reversed, it's5,0. \n\nRow4's first two elements are0,5 \u2192 reversed5,0. \n\nSo output would be:\n\n[5,0]\n\n[5,0]\n\nBut this doesn't match the examples. \n\nAlternatively, considering that in Example0 and Example2, the output is formed by taking the first two elements of row1 reversed and the last two elements of row4 reversed. For Example0:\n\nRow1's first two:2,2 \u2192 reversed [2,2] (same). Row4's last two:2,0 \u2192 reversed [0,2]. But output is [2,0]. Doesn't fit.\n\nExample2: row1's first two:8,0 \u2192 reversed [0,8]. Row4's last two:8,0 \u2192 reversed [0,8]. But output is [0,8] and [8,0]. So this doesn't fit.\n\nGiven that I'm stuck, I'll look for the most consistent pattern among the examples and apply it to the test input.\n\nBased on the examples, it appears that the output rows are derived from row1 and row4. In Example0, row1's first two and row4's last two. In Example1, row0's first two and row4's first two. In Example2, row1's third and fourth and row4's fourth and fifth.\n\nBut this is inconsistent. However, I notice that in all examples, the output rows' elements are present in the input but in a different order. For instance, Example2's [0,8] and [8,0] can be found as pairs in row1 and row4.\n\nIn the test input, the pairs [0,5] and [5,0] are present in row1 and row4. For example, row1's first and fifth elements are0 and5 \u2192 [0,5]. Row4's first and fifth are0 and5 \u2192 [0,5]. If reversed, [5,0] could be another pair. But there's no such pair in the test input. However, row1's fourth and fifth elements are0 and5 \u2192 [0,5]. Row4's fourth and fifth elements are0 and5 \u2192 [0,5]. \n\nBut how does this align with the examples?\n\nGiven that I'm out of time, I'll guess that the output is:\n\n[5,0]\n\n[0,5]\n\nBut according to the examples, the output is formatted with two rows. In Example2, the first output row is [0,8], and the second is [8,0]. So if the test input has a similar structure, perhaps the output is [0,5] and [5,0]. But where would these come from?\n\nLooking at row1 of the test input: [0,5,0,0,5]. The third and fourth elements are0,0 \u2192 no. Fourth and fifth are0,5 \u2192 [0,5]. \n\nRow4: [0,5,0,0,5]. Fourth and fifth:0,5 \u2192 [0,5]. \n\nNo. But row1's first two elements are0,5 \u2192 [0,5]. Row4's first two elements are0,5 \u2192 [0,5]. But the examples show mirrored pairs. \n\nAlternatively, row3's first two elements are5,5 \u2192 [5,5]. Row1's first two are0,5 \u2192 [0,5]. But this doesn't mirror.\n\nIn Example2, the output is [0,8] and [8,0]. These are reverse pairs. So perhaps the test input's output is [0,5] and [5,0], forming reverse pairs. To get these:\n\nRow1's fourth and fifth elements are0,5 \u2192 [0,5]. Row4's first and second elements are0,5 \u2192 [0,5]. Doesn't help. \n\nBut perhaps row1's first and fifth elements:0 and5 \u2192 [0,5]. Row4's fifth and first elements:5 and0 \u2192 [5,0]. \n\nThus, output would be:\n\n[0,5]\n\n[5,0]\n\nWhich is the reverse pair. This aligns with Example2's output. So I think this is the correct pattern.",

        "cot_2": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. So, we have these input grids and their corresponding outputs. The goal is to see how the input is transformed into the output. Let's look at each example step by step.\n\nStarting with Example 0. The input is a 5x5 grid. The output is two rows, each with two elements. Let me write them out:\n\nInput:\nRow 0: [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]\nRow 1: [2, 2, 0, 2, 2]\nRow 2: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\nRow 3: [0, 2, 0, 2, 2]\nRow 4: [2, 2, 0, 2, 0]\n\nOutput:\n[2, 2]\n[2, 0]\n\nHmm. The output has two rows. Let's see if they correspond to some specific rows or columns from the input. Maybe the first and last rows? Let's check the first row of the input: [0,2,0,0,2]. The output first row is [2,2]. Not sure. Wait, maybe the middle row (row 2) is all zeros, so maybe that's a separator. So maybe the output is combining rows above and below the middle.\n\nIn Example 0, the output rows are [2,2] and [2,0]. Let's look at the rows above the middle (row 0 and row 1) and below (row 3 and 4). Let's see:\n\nRows 0 and 1:\n\nRow0: 0,2,0,0,2\nRow1:2,2,0,2,2\n\nRows 3 and 4:\n\nRow3:0,2,0,2,2\nRow4:2,2,0,2,0\n\nThe output is two rows. Let's see if they're taking elements from these rows. For the first output row [2,2], maybe looking at the first elements of row1 and row3? Row1 starts with 2, row3 starts with 0. Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, maybe the first and last elements of certain rows. For example, row1's first element is 2 and last is 2. Row4's first is 2 and last is 0. Wait, the output first row is [2,2] which matches row1's first and last. The second output row is [2,0], which is row4's first and last. So maybe the output is taking the first and last elements of the second row (row1) and the fifth row (row4) in the input.\n\nWait, in Example 0, the output is two rows. Let's check:\n\nRow1: [2,2,0,2,2] \u2192 first and last elements are 2 and 2 \u2192 but output first row is [2,2]. So that's possible. Row4: [2,2,0,2,0] \u2192 first and last are 2 and 0 \u2192 output second row [2,0]. That matches.\n\nThen in Example 1:\n\nInput:\n\nRow0: [1,0,0,1,0]\nRow1: [0,1,0,0,1]\nRow2: [0,0,0,0,0]\nRow3: [1,0,0,1,0]\nRow4: [1,1,0,0,1]\n\nOutput:\n[1,0]\n[1,1]\n\nSo applying the same logic: look at row1's first and last elements. Row1: first is 0, last is 1. But output first row is [1,0]. Wait that doesn't match. Hmm, maybe the other way around? Last and first? 1 and 0. Output is [1,0]. Oh, maybe the last element comes first. So row1's last element is 1, first is 0 \u2192 [1,0]. Then row4's first is 1, last is 1 \u2192 [1,1]. That matches the output. So the pattern is taking the last element of row1 and then the first element of row1 to form the first output row. Then for the second output row, take the first and last elements of row4.\n\nWait, let me confirm. Example 0's row1 is [2,2,0,2,2]. Last element is 2, first is 2 \u2192 output [2,2]. Then row4's last element is 0, first is 2 \u2192 output [2,0]. So maybe first output row is [last of row1, first of row1], but in Example 0 that would be [2,2], which is same as original first and last. Wait no, maybe the first output row is combining the last element of row1 and the first element of row3. Let me check.\n\nIn Example 0, row3 is [0,2,0,2,2]. If the first output row is row1's last (2) and row3's first (0), that would be [2,0], but the output is [2,2]. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking the first element of row1 and row3, and then their last elements. Not sure.\n\nWait, let's look at another example. Example2's input:\n\nRow0: [8,8,0,0,8]\nRow1: [8,0,0,8,0]\nRow2: [0,0,0,0,0]\nRow3: [8,8,0,8,8]\nRow4: [8,0,0,8,0]\n\nOutput:\n[0,8]\n[8,0]\n\nIf we follow the previous pattern: row1's last element is 0, first is 8. So [0,8], which matches the first output row. Row4's first is 8, last is 0 \u2192 [8,0]. Which matches the second output row. So that works. So the pattern seems to be: for the first output row, take row1's last element and then row1's first element. Then for the second output row, take row4's first element and row4's last element. Wait no, in Example2's output first row is [0,8], which would be row1's last (0) and row1's first (8). So [0,8]. Then row4's first is 8, last is 0 \u2192 [8,0].\n\nYes, that fits. Let's check Example1 again. Row1's last element is 1, first is 0 \u2192 [1,0], which is the first output row. Row4's first is 1, last is 1 \u2192 [1,1]. That matches. And Example0: row1's last is 2, first is 2 \u2192 [2,2]; row4's first is 2, last is 0 \u2192 [2,0]. So yes, the pattern is that the output is two rows. The first row is [last element of row1, first element of row1], and the second row is [first element of row4, last element of row4].\n\nWait, but in Example0, row4 is [2,2,0,2,0], so first is 2, last is 0. So the second output row would be [2,0], which matches. So the general rule is: the output consists of two rows. The first row is the last element of row1 (index 1) followed by the first element of row1. The second row is the first element of row4 (index 4) followed by the last element of row4.\n\nSo, applying this to the test input. Let's look at the test input:\n\nTest Input:\nRow0: [5,5,0,5,0]\nRow1: [0,5,0,0,5]\nRow2: [0,0,0,0,0]\nRow3: [5,5,0,5,5]\nRow4: [0,5,0,0,5]\n\nSo, row1 is [0,5,0,0,5]. The last element is 5, the first element is 0. So the first output row would be [5,0]. Then row4 is [0,5,0,0,5]. The first element is 0, the last is 5. So the second output row is [0,5]. \n\nWait, but looking at the training examples, the outputs in the first row are [last, first] of row1, and the second row is [first, last] of row4. So test input would output [5,0] and [0,5]. But let's check if that's correct.\n\nWait, but let me check the training examples again. Example1's row4 is [1,1,0,0,1]. First element 1, last element 1. So output second row is [1,1]. Yes. So the second row is [first, last] of row4.\n\nSo for the test input, applying this:\n\nFirst output row: row1 last (5), row1 first (0) \u2192 [5,0]\n\nSecond output row: row4 first (0), row4 last (5) \u2192 [0,5]\n\nSo the output should be:\n\n[5,0]\n[0,5]\n\nBut wait, looking back at the training examples, the outputs are:\n\nExample0: [2,2] and [2,0] \u2192 which are row1's last (2) and first (2) \u2192 yes. Row4's first (2) and last (0) \u2192 [2,0]\n\nExample1: [1,0] \u2192 row1's last (1) and first (0). Then [1,1] \u2192 row4's first (1) and last (1).\n\nExample2: [0,8] \u2192 row1's last (0) and first (8). Then [8,0] \u2192 row4's first (8) and last (0).\n\nSo the pattern holds. Then applying this to the test input:\n\nRow1: [0,5,0,0,5]. Last element is 5 (index 4), first is 0 (index 0) \u2192 [5,0]\n\nRow4: [0,5,0,0,5]. First is 0, last is 5 \u2192 [0,5]\n\nSo the output should be:\n\n[5,0]\n[0,5]\n\nBut let me check the training examples again to see if there's another possible pattern. For instance, maybe it's rows 1 and 3? Let's check Example0. Row3: [0,2,0,2,2]. First element 0, last 2. But output is [2,2] and [2,0]. Hmm, that doesn't fit. So the initial conclusion seems correct.\n\nTherefore, the answer for the test input should be:\n\n[5, 0]\n[0, 5]"
