        "cot_1": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. So, looking at the training examples, each input is a list of rows filled with zeros except the last row, which has a 1 followed by zeros. The outputs seem to transform these into rows with 8s and 1s. Let's break down each example.\n\nStarting with Example 0: The input is 10 rows of [0,0], with the last being [1,0]. The output alternates between [8,1] and [1,8] for each row. Except the first output row is [8,1], then [1,8], and so on. Wait, the output has 10 rows. Let's count: The first is [8,1], then [1,8], then [8,1], etc., alternating each line. So maybe each input row (all zeros except the last) is being transformed into a pattern that alternates between starting with 8 and 1 for each row. But why?\n\nExample 1 is similar but with 3 elements. The input is 10 rows of [0,0,0], last row [1,0,0]. The output here is a bit more complex. Let's look at the first few output rows: [8,1,8], [1,8,8], [8,1,8], [8,8,1], etc. Hmm. It seems like the 1 is moving positions. Like in the first output row, the 1 is in the second position. Then the next row, the 1 is in the first position. Then again in the second, then third, and so on. Wait, maybe the position of the 1 is shifting each row. For a 3-element case, the pattern might be cycling the position of the 1 through different columns, while the 8s fill the rest. Let's see:\n\nFirst output row: [8,1,8] \u2192 1 at index 1.\nSecond: [1,8,8] \u2192 index 0.\nThird: [8,1,8] \u2192 index 1 again?\nWait, maybe not. Let me list the positions:\n\nExample 1 Output:\nRow 0: 8,1,8 \u2192 1 at position 1\nRow 1: 1,8,8 \u2192 position 0\nRow 2: 8,1,8 \u2192 position 1\nRow 3: 8,8,1 \u2192 position 2\nRow 4: 8,1,8 \u2192 position 1\nRow 5: 1,8,8 \u2192 position 0\nRow 6: 8,1,8 \u2192 position 1\nRow 7: 8,8,1 \u2192 position 2\nRow 8: 8,1,8 \u2192 position 1\nRow 9: 1,8,8 \u2192 position 0\n\nHmm, the 1 is moving in the order 1,0,1,2,1,0,1,2,1,0. So maybe it's moving left and right, cycling through positions. For the 3-element case, the positions are 1,0,1,2, repeating every 3 rows? Not sure. Let's check Example 2.\n\nExample 2 input is 4-element rows, with the last row being [1,0,0,0]. The output for this is:\n\nRow 0: [8,8,8,1] \u2192 1 at position 3\nRow 1: [8,8,1,8] \u2192 position 2\nRow 2: [8,1,8,8] \u2192 position 1\nRow 3: [1,8,8,8] \u2192 position 0\nRow 4: [8,1,8,8] \u2192 position 1\nRow 5: [8,8,1,8] \u2192 position 2\nRow 6: [8,8,8,1] \u2192 position 3\nRow 7: [8,8,1,8] \u2192 position 2\nRow 8: [8,1,8,8] \u2192 position 1\nRow 9: [1,8,8,8] \u2192 position 0\n\nSo here, the 1 is moving from position 3 (last) to 2, 1, 0, then back to 1, 2, 3, 2, 1, 0. It's like a snake pattern. So for the 4-element case, the 1 starts at the end (position 3), moves left each row until position 0, then moves right to 1, then left again? Wait, after row 3 (position 0), row 4 is position 1 (moving right?), then row5 is position 2 (right again), row6 is position3 (right), row7 is position2 (left), row8 is position1 (left), row9 is position0. Hmm, maybe the pattern is that the 1 moves left until it hits the start, then moves right for some steps, then left again? Or perhaps the direction changes each time it hits an end.\n\nLooking at the 4-element example's positions:\n\n3 \u21922\u21921\u21920 \u21921\u21922\u21923\u21922\u21921\u21920. So from 0, it starts moving right again to 1,2,3, then back to 2,1,0. So the pattern is: after reaching position0 (left end), it starts moving right for three steps (1,2,3), then left again (2,1,0). So for the 4-element case, the movement is like a wave.\n\nSo the general pattern seems to be that for each row in the output, the position of the 1 is moving in a certain pattern based on the row index and the number of elements. The 8s fill the other positions. The number of elements (length of the input rows) determines the movement pattern of the 1.\n\nLooking at how the positions change for each example:\n\nFor the 2-element case (Example0):\n\nEach row alternates between position0 and position1. So for even rows (0,2,4,6,8) it's [8,1], position1. Then odd rows (1,3,5,7,9) it's [1,8], position0. So alternating each row.\n\nBut in Example0's output, the first row is [8,1] (position1), then [1,8], etc. So for 2 elements, the 1 alternates between position1 and 0 each row.\n\nFor 3 elements (Example1), the positions go 1,0,1,2,1,0,1,2,1,0. So maybe the pattern is moving left, then right, then left again. Like: start at position1 (middle for 3 elements?), then move left to 0, back to 1, then right to 2, back to 1, left to 0, etc. So perhaps it's a cycle of positions: 1,0,1,2,1,0,1,2, etc.\n\nFor 4 elements (Example2), the positions start at 3 (last), then 2,1,0 (left movement), then 1,2,3 (right), then 2,1,0 again. So a snake-like pattern.\n\nSo, the key seems to be that the 1 moves in a certain pattern through the positions, with the movement direction changing when it hits the ends, and the exact pattern depends on the number of elements (n).\n\nThe input to output transformation is that the all-zero rows (except the last one) are transformed into rows where a 1 moves in a certain pattern, and the rest are 8s.\n\nNow, the test input is 5-element rows. Let's see what the pattern would be for 5 elements. Following the previous examples:\n\nFor n=2: alternate positions 1 and 0 each row.\n\nn=3: positions cycle 1,0,1,2,1,0,1,2, etc.\n\nn=4: positions move left to 0, then right to 3, then left again.\n\nFor n=5, perhaps the 1 starts at the last position (position4), moves left each row until position0, then moves right to position1, then left to 0 again? Or maybe after reaching 0, it moves right to 1, 2, 3,4, then left again.\n\nLooking at example 2 (n=4), after position0 (row3), the next positions are 1 (row4), 2 (row5), 3 (row6), then 2 (row7), 1 (row8), 0 (row9). So for n=4, after reaching 0, the direction is right (increasing) for 3 steps (positions1,2,3), then left again (positions2,1,0).\n\nSo for n=5, the pattern might be:\n\nStart at position4 (last), move left each row until position0. Then move right to position1, then left again to 0? Or maybe after position0, move right for 4 steps (positions1,2,3,4), then left again. But the example for n=4, after reaching 0 (row3), they go up to 3 (row6), which is n-1=3. Then go back down.\n\nSo for n=5, the pattern would be:\n\nRow0: position4\n\nRow1:3\n\nRow2:2\n\nRow3:1\n\nRow4:0\n\nRow5:1\n\nRow6:2\n\nRow7:3\n\nRow8:4\n\nRow9:3\n\nBut the test input has 10 rows (0 to 9). Let's see:\n\nTest input is 5 elements. The output should have 10 rows. Let's list the positions for each row:\n\nFor n=5, the positions would be:\n\nRow0:4\n\nRow1:3\n\nRow2:2\n\nRow3:1\n\nRow4:0\n\nRow5:1\n\nRow6:2\n\nRow7:3\n\nRow8:4\n\nRow9:3\n\nSo that's moving left until position0 (row4), then right to 4 (row8), then left again (row9 to3). But let's check if that fits the previous examples.\n\nBut wait, in example2 (n=4), the positions after row3 (0) were 1,2,3,2,1,0. So after 0, they went up to 3 (n-1), then down. For n=5, after reaching 0 (row4), the next steps would be 1,2,3,4 (row5 to row8), then back to 3 (row9). So the pattern is a wave: left until 0, then right until n-1, then left again.\n\nThus, for each row in the output, the position of the 1 is determined by the row index, and the direction changes when hitting 0 or n-1.\n\nSo, applying this to the test case (n=5):\n\nRow0:4\n\nRow1:3\n\nRow2:2\n\nRow3:1\n\nRow4:0\n\nRow5:1\n\nRow6:2\n\nRow7:3\n\nRow8:4\n\nRow9:3\n\nSo, each row's 1 position:\n\nRow0:4 \u2192 [8,8,8,8,1]\n\nRow1:3 \u2192 [8,8,8,1,8]\n\nRow2:2 \u2192 [8,8,1,8,8]\n\nRow3:1 \u2192 [8,1,8,8,8]\n\nRow4:0 \u2192 [1,8,8,8,8]\n\nRow5:1 \u2192 [8,1,8,8,8]\n\nRow6:2 \u2192 [8,8,1,8,8]\n\nRow7:3 \u2192 [8,8,8,1,8]\n\nRow8:4 \u2192 [8,8,8,8,1]\n\nRow9:3 \u2192 [8,8,8,1,8]\n\nWait, but let's check how the previous examples transition. For example, in Example2 (n=4), after row3 (position0), the next row4 is position1, then row5 position2, row6 position3, row7 position2, row8 position1, row9 position0. So for n=4, the movement after 0 is to increase up to 3, then decrease again. So for n=5, after row4 (0), next row5 would be 1, then row6 2, row7 3, row8 4, then row9 3. So yes, that's the pattern.\n\nSo the output for the test input would be:\n\nRow0: [8,8,8,8,1]\n\nRow1: [8,8,8,1,8]\n\nRow2: [8,8,1,8,8]\n\nRow3: [8,1,8,8,8]\n\nRow4: [1,8,8,8,8]\n\nRow5: [8,1,8,8,8]\n\nRow6: [8,8,1,8,8]\n\nRow7: [8,8,8,1,8]\n\nRow8: [8,8,8,8,1]\n\nRow9: [8,8,8,1,8]\n\nBut let's check the last row of the test input. The input's last row is [1,0,0,0,0]. The output's last row (row9) should follow the pattern. According to the movement, row9's position is 3. So the output row9 would have 1 at position3: [8,8,8,1,8]. Which matches the pattern.\n\nSo the final answer is each row of the test input transformed into these patterns.",

        "cot_2": "Okay, let's see. I need to figure out the pattern that transforms the input arrays into the output arrays. Let's start by looking at the training examples.\n\nFirst, Example 0. The input is 10 rows of [0,0], except the last one which is [1,0]. The output has alternating [8,1] and [1,8] for the first 9 rows, then [1,8] again. Wait, the last input row is [1,0], and the last output row is [1,8]. So maybe the position of the 1 in the input affects where the 1 and 8s are placed in the output.\n\nIn Example 0, the input's last row has the 1 in the first position. The output for that row is [1,8], so maybe the 1 is in the position where the input had the 1. But in the previous rows, which are all zeros, the pattern alternates between [8,1] and [1,8]. But how does that work? Let's check the number of elements. The input for Example 0 is 2 elements per row, and the output alternates the 1 and 8. For the first 9 rows (all zeros), the outputs alternate starting with 8, then 1, etc. Then the last row, which has a 1, outputs [1,8]. So maybe when there's a 1 in the input row, the 1 in the output is placed at that position, and 8s elsewhere. But wait, the input rows have zeros except the last one. So maybe the input's 1 is transformed into a 1 in the output, and the rest 8s. But in Example 0's output, the last row is [1,8], which has 1 in the first position (same as the input's 1). Then the others, since they have all zeros, are following a different pattern.\n\nWait, maybe the input's rows are transformed by rotating the position of 1 and 8s, but only when the input row is all zeros. Let's check Example 1. The input has 3 elements. The outputs have 8s and 1s arranged in a way that shifts each row. For instance, the first output row is [8,1,8], then next [1,8,8], then [8,1,8], then [8,8,1], and so on. It seems like the 1 is moving positions each row. Like a rotating pattern. For 3 elements, maybe the 1 cycles through the positions: first position, then second, then third, then back. But looking at the outputs for Example 1, the first row is [8,1,8], the second [1,8,8], third [8,1,8], fourth [8,8,1], fifth [8,1,8], sixth [1,8,8], etc. Hmm, maybe the pattern is shifting the 1's position in each row, but not strictly rotating. Let me count the positions of 1 in Example 1's output:\n\nRow 0: index 1\nRow 1: index 0\nRow 2: index 1\nRow 3: index 2\nRow 4: index 1\nRow 5: index 0\nRow 6: index 1\nRow 7: index 2\nRow 8: index 1\nRow 9: index 0 (since the input's last row is [1,0,0], which is row 9, the output is [1,8,8])\n\nWait, the last row's input is [1,0,0], which in output is [1,8,8]. So the 1 is in the first position, same as input. So maybe, when a row in the input has a 1, the output for that row has 1 in the same position, and 8s elsewhere. Then, the other rows (all zeros) follow a rotating pattern where the 1 shifts positions in a cycle.\n\nBut how does the cycle work? For Example 0, the output alternates between [8,1] and [1,8]. So for even rows (0, 2, 4, etc.) it's [8,1], odd rows (1,3,5) [1,8]. But for Example 1 with 3 elements, the pattern is more complex. Let's list the positions of 1 in each output row:\n\nExample 1 output rows:\n\n0: 1\n1: 0\n2: 1\n3: 2\n4: 1\n5:0\n6:1\n7:2\n8:1\n9:0\n\nSo the positions are 1,0,1,2,1,0,1,2,1,0. It's like moving from position 1 to 0 to 1 to 2, then back to 1, 0, etc. Maybe it's a back-and-forth pattern? Like 1,0,1,2,1,0,1,2, etc. For 3 elements, the 1 moves left and right.\n\nIn Example 2, which has 4 elements. Let's look at the outputs:\n\nRow 0: [8,8,8,1] \u2192 position 3\nRow 1: [8,8,1,8] \u2192 position 2\nRow 2: [8,1,8,8] \u2192 position 1\nRow 3: [1,8,8,8] \u2192 position 0\nRow 4: [8,1,8,8] \u2192 position 1\nRow 5: [8,8,1,8] \u2192 position 2\nRow 6: [8,8,8,1] \u2192 position 3\nRow 7: [8,8,1,8] \u2192 position 2\nRow 8: [8,1,8,8] \u2192 position 1\nRow 9: [1,8,8,8] \u2192 position 0 (since input row 9 is [1,0,0,0])\n\nSo here, for the first four rows (0-3), the 1 moves from position 3 to 2 to 1 to 0. Then rows 4-7 go back up to 3 again. Wait, row 4 is position 1, row 5 position 2, row 6 position 3, row 7 position 2, row 8 position 1, row 9 position 0. Hmm, so it's like a cycle that goes 3 \u21922 \u21921 \u21920 \u21921 \u21922 \u21923 \u21922 \u21921 \u21920. So the 1 moves left until position 0, then moves right to 1,2,3, then left again. So for even number of elements, the movement is a snake-like pattern.\n\nPutting this together, the pattern seems to be:\n\n- For each row in the input that is all zeros (except the last row which has a single 1), the output row has a single 1 and the rest 8s. The position of the 1 in these output rows cycles through certain positions in a specific order.\n\nThe cycle depends on the number of elements in the row (length n). For example:\n\n- When n=2 (Example 0), the 1 alternates positions between 0 and 1 for each row. But the example shows that rows 0,2,4,6,8 are [8,1], and rows 1,3,5,7,9 are [1,8]. So for even rows (0-based), position 1, odd rows position 0. But wait, no. Because the output alternates starting with [8,1] (row 0), then [1,8] (row 1), etc. So for even index rows (0,2,4,6,8), it's [8,1], which is 1 at position 1. For odd index rows (1,3,5,7,9), 1 at position 0. Except the last row in Example 0 is [1,0], which outputs [1,8]. Since the input's last row has a 1, the output's 1 is at position 0, same as the input.\n\nWait, but in the training examples, the last row of input has a 1 in the first position. The output's corresponding row has a 1 in that position, with the rest 8s. So the rule is: for any input row that has a 1, the output row places 1 in the same position, and 8s elsewhere. For rows with all zeros, the output alternates the position of the 1 in a specific pattern.\n\nThe pattern for all-zero rows is to cycle the 1's position in a way that for each row, the 1's position shifts. For n=2, it alternates between positions 1 and 0. For n=3, it's a pattern like 1\u21920\u21921\u21922\u21921\u21920... For n=4, it's 3\u21922\u21921\u21920\u21921\u21922\u21923\u21922\u21921\u21920 (as in Example 2's outputs for rows 0-9).\n\nSo the general approach is:\n\n1. For each input row, if it contains a 1 (like the last row in each example), the output row has a 1 in the same position as the input's 1, and 8s in all other positions.\n\n2. For all-zero rows, the output rows have a single 1 that cycles through positions in a way that for n elements, the 1 moves in a pattern that goes from (n-1) down to 0, then back up to (n-2), then down to 0 again, creating a snake-like pattern. Wait, let's check:\n\nIn Example 2 (n=4), the positions for the first 4 rows are 3,2,1,0. Then row 4 is 1 (so back up), row5:2, row6:3, row7:2, row8:1, row9:0. Wait, but row9 in example 2 is the last row which has a 1 in position 0, but according to the input, that's the last row which has [1,0,0,0], so output is [1,8,8,8]. So the all-zero rows (rows 0-8) follow the snake pattern.\n\nSo the cycle for all-zero rows:\n\nFor n=2: positions 1,0,1,0,... alternating each row.\n\nFor n=3: positions 1,0,1,2,1,0,1,2,1,0 (as in Example 1, 10 rows, starting with 1 for row0).\n\nFor n=4: positions 3,2,1,0,1,2,3,2,1,0 (Example 2's rows 0-9, except row9 is handled by the input's 1).\n\nWait, in Example 2, rows 0-8 are all-zero, and row9 is [1,0,0,0]. The outputs for rows 0-8 (9 rows) would be:\n\nRow0:3\nRow1:2\nRow2:1\nRow3:0\nRow4:1\nRow5:2\nRow6:3\nRow7:2\nRow8:1\n\nThen row9 is handled by the 1 in input, position0.\n\nSo the pattern for n elements in the rows is:\n\nThe 1 in the output for all-zero input rows cycles through positions starting from (n-1) and moving left, then right, then left again, etc., creating a snake-like pattern.\n\nSo for n=2:\n\nPositions: 1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1 (for 9 rows). Let's see in Example0, the outputs for rows 0-8 (9 rows):\n\nRows 0,2,4,6,8: position1 ([8,1])\nRows 1,3,5,7: position0 ([1,8])\n\nSo it's alternating every row. So the pattern is 1,0,1,0,... for n=2.\n\nFor n=3:\n\nThe positions for rows 0-8 are:\n\nRow0:1\n\nRow1:0\n\nRow2:1\n\nRow3:2\n\nRow4:1\n\nRow5:0\n\nRow6:1\n\nRow7:2\n\nRow8:1\n\nThen row9:0 (but row9 is the input's 1, so not part of the all-zero rows).\n\nFor n=4:\n\nRows 0-8:\n\nRow0:3\n\nRow1:2\n\nRow2:1\n\nRow3:0\n\nRow4:1\n\nRow5:2\n\nRow6:3\n\nRow7:2\n\nRow8:1\n\nSo it's a cycle that starts at n-1, goes down to 0, then up to n-2, then down to 0 again, etc.\n\nSo the general pattern for all-zero rows is:\n\nThe position of 1 in the output row is determined by the row index (starting from 0), and the length of the row (n). The position cycles in a way that for each row, the position is (current step) mod (2n - 2), then mirrored.\n\nWait, maybe it's similar to a wave pattern. For example, the position is determined by the row index modulo (2n - 2), and then the direction alternates. Let me think. For n=4, the modulus would be 2*4 -2 =6. Let's see:\n\nRow0:3 \u2192 which is 3 = (0) mod 6? No. Hmm, perhaps another approach.\n\nAlternatively, the positions are determined by a \"bounce\" between 0 and (n-1). For example, for n=4, the positions go 3,2,1,0 (down), then 1,2,3 (up), then 2,1,0 (down again). But in Example2, after 0 (row3), next is 1 (row4), then 2 (row5), 3 (row6), then 2 (row7), 1 (row8), 0 (row9, but that's handled by input). So the pattern is down from 3 to 0 (4 steps), up to 3 (steps 4-6), then down again (steps7-9). But how does this relate to the row index?\n\nAlternatively, for each all-zero row, the position of 1 is determined by a wave that starts at (n-1) and moves left each row, wrapping around and bouncing back. For example, the position for row i (starting from 0) is determined by:\n\nposition = (n-1) - (i % (2*(n-1))) if i % (2*(n-1)) < (n-1)\n\nelse\n\nposition = (i % (n-1)) \n\nWait, maybe not. Let's try n=4.\n\nFor n=4, 2*(n-1) = 6. So for each i:\n\nIf i mod 6 is less than 4 (since n-1=3), then position is 3 - (i mod 6)\n\nElse, position is (i mod 6) -3\n\nLet's test this:\n\nRow0: i=0 \u2192 0 mod6=0 \u2192 3-0=3 \u2192 correct.\n\nRow1:1 \u21923-1=2 \u2192correct.\n\nRow2:3-2=1 \u2192correct.\n\nRow3:3-3=0 \u2192correct.\n\nRow4:4 mod6=4 \u21924-3=1 \u2192position1 \u2192correct (row4 in example2 is [8,1,8,8] \u2192 position1).\n\nRow5:5 mod6=5 \u21925-3=2 \u2192position2 \u2192correct (row5 is [8,8,1,8]).\n\nRow6:6 mod6=0 \u21923-0=3 \u2192row6 is [8,8,8,1] \u2192correct.\n\nRow7:7 mod6=1 \u21923-1=2 \u2192row7 is [8,8,1,8] \u2192correct.\n\nRow8:8 mod6=2 \u21923-2=1 \u2192row8 is [8,1,8,8] \u2192correct.\n\nRow9: handled by input.\n\nThis seems to work. So the formula for the position of 1 in the output for all-zero rows is:\n\nFor row index i (starting from 0), and n elements:\n\ncycle_length = 2*(n-1)\n\npos_in_cycle = i % cycle_length\n\nif pos_in_cycle < (n-1):\n\n    position = (n-1) - pos_in_cycle\n\nelse:\n\n    position = pos_in_cycle - (n-1)\n\nSo for each i, compute pos_in_cycle, then determine the position based on whether it's in the first half (descending) or second half (ascending) of the cycle.\n\nLet's test this for n=3 (cycle_length=4):\n\nExample1's all-zero rows are 0-8 (i=0 to 8). Let's compute each position:\n\ni=0: cycle_length=4 \u2192pos_in_cycle=0. Since 0 <3-1=2? Wait, n=3, so n-1=2. So if pos_in_cycle < (n-1) \u2192 0<2 \u2192 yes. Position=2 -0=2? Wait, but in Example1, the first row (i=0) has position1. Wait, maybe the formula is adjusted. Wait, for n=3:\n\ncycle_length=2*(3-1)=4.\n\nFor i=0: pos_in_cycle=0.\n\nIf pos_in_cycle <3-1 \u21920<2 \u2192 yes. Then position=(3-1) - pos_in_cycle \u21922-0=2. But in Example1's first output row (i=0), the position is1. Hmm, that's a discrepancy. So perhaps my formula is incorrect.\n\nWait, for n=3, the output positions in Example1 are:\n\ni | pos\n0 | 1\n1 |0\n2 |1\n3 |2\n4 |1\n5 |0\n6 |1\n7 |2\n8 |1\n\nSo for i=0, position1. According to the formula:\n\npos_in_cycle =0 mod4=0.\n\nSince 0 < (3-1)=2 \u2192 yes. So position=(3-1)-0=2. But actual position is1. So the formula isn't matching here.\n\nSo maybe my initial approach was wrong. Let's think differently.\n\nAlternative approach: For each all-zero row, the position of 1 is determined by the row index, and cycles through positions in a way that for even n, it's a certain pattern, and for odd n, another pattern. But how?\n\nLooking back at Example1 (n=3). The positions of 1 in the output for all-zero rows (rows 0-8):\n\n0:1\n\n1:0\n\n2:1\n\n3:2\n\n4:1\n\n5:0\n\n6:1\n\n7:2\n\n8:1\n\nSo the pattern is 1,0,1,2,1,0,1,2,1. This seems like the 1 is moving from position1 to0 to1 to2 to1 to0 etc. So it's like a pendulum swinging between 0 and2, passing through1 each time. So the steps are:\n\nStart at1.\n\nNext, move left to0.\n\nThen back to1.\n\nThen right to2.\n\nThen back to1.\n\nThen left to0.\n\nSo for n=3, the cycle is: 1,0,1,2,1,0,1,2,1...\n\nWhich is a cycle of length4 (0,1,2,1,0,1,2,1...), but perhaps the cycle is length4 for n=3.\n\nWait, maybe the cycle length is 2*(n-1) for any n, but the starting position is (n//2). For n=3, the middle position is1. So starting there, then moving left, then right, etc.\n\nAlternatively, the starting position is the middle of the array. For odd n, it's the center; for even n, perhaps the first of the two middle positions.\n\nWait for n=2: the starting position is1 (since index starts at0). Then alternate between1 and0.\n\nFor n=3: starting at1, then 0, then1, then2, then1, then0, etc.\n\nFor n=4: starting at3, then2,1,0, then1,2,3, then2,1,0, etc. So starting at the last position.\n\nHmm, perhaps the starting position for the cycle is (n-1) for even n and (n//2) for odd n? Or maybe always starts at (n-1) when all-zero rows.\n\nWait, in Example0 (n=2), the first row is [8,1], position1. Then alternates. For Example1 (n=3), first row is [8,1,8], position1. For Example2 (n=4), first row is [8,8,8,1], position3. So it seems that for all-zero rows, the first row's 1 is placed at position (n-1), then the next row (n-2), and so on, until position0, then starts increasing again. So for n=4, it's 3\u21922\u21921\u21920\u21921\u21922\u21923\u21922\u21921\u21920. So the cycle length is 2*(n-1), which for n=4 is6. Each cycle goes down to 0, then up to (n-1)-1, then down again, etc.\n\nSo, the pattern for all-zero rows is:\n\nFor row index i (0-based), the position of 1 in the output is determined by:\n\ncycle_length = 2*(n-1)\n\nrelative_pos = i % cycle_length\n\nif relative_pos < (n-1):\n\n    position = (n-1) - relative_pos\n\nelse:\n\n    position = relative_pos - (n-1)\n\nLet's test this for n=3:\n\ncycle_length=2*(3-1)=4.\n\nFor i=0: relative_pos=0 \u2192 0 <3-1=2 \u2192 yes. position=2-0=2. But in Example1, row0 has position1. So this formula gives 2, but actual is1. So the formula is incorrect.\n\nHmm. What's wrong here.\n\nIn Example1, the first row (i=0) has position1. According to the formula, position=2-0=2. But that's not the case. So the formula is not working.\n\nAlternative approach: Maybe the cycle starts at position (n//2). For n=2, it starts at1. For n=3, starts at1. For n=4, starts at3 (or maybe 2 for even numbers? Wait, no. For n=4, it's starting at3.\n\nWait, perhaps the cycle starts at (n-1) for even n and ( (n-1)/2 ) for odd n. For n=3: (3-1)/2=1. That matches Example1's starting at1. For n=2:1, which is correct. For n=4:3, which matches Example2.\n\nSo maybe the starting position is (n-1) for even n and ( (n-1)/2 ) for odd n. Then, the cycle alternates moving left and right.\n\nBut how does the movement proceed?\n\nFor n=3 (starting at1):\n\nRow0:1\n\nThen move left to0 (row1).\n\nThen move right to1 (row2).\n\nThen right to2 (row3).\n\nThen left to1 (row4).\n\nThen left to0 (row5).\n\nThen right to1 (row6).\n\nThen right to2 (row7).\n\nThen left to1 (row8).\n\nWhich matches Example1's output.\n\nFor n=4 (starting at3):\n\nRow0:3\n\nRow1:2\n\nRow2:1\n\nRow3:0\n\nRow4:1\n\nRow5:2\n\nRow6:3\n\nRow7:2\n\nRow8:1\n\nWhich matches Example2's outputs.\n\nSo the pattern is:\n\nFor each all-zero row, the position of the 1 starts at (n-1) if n is even, or at (n-1)//2 if n is odd, then alternates moving left and right. But wait, for n=3, which is odd, starting at1. Then the movement is left, then right, then right, then left, etc.?\n\nAlternatively, for each step, the direction changes when hitting the boundaries.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the direction is left until the end (position0), then right until position(n-1), then left again, and so on. But that would create a zig-zag pattern.\n\nBut in Example1 (n=3), after starting at1, then row1 is0 (left), row2 is1 (right), row3 is2 (right), row4 is1 (left), row5 is0 (left), row6 is1 (right), row7 is2 (right), row8 is1 (left).\n\nThis seems like a pattern where after moving left once, then right twice, then left twice, then right twice, etc. Not sure. Maybe the direction alternates each time a boundary is hit.\n\nAlternatively, the movement is a sine wave-like pattern where the position moves left then right, etc., but the step counts vary.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the pattern for all-zero rows is a cycle that starts at a certain position and moves left each time, wrapping around.\n\nBut this is getting complicated. Maybe there's a simpler way.\n\nLooking at all examples, the pattern for all-zero rows is a wave that starts from the rightmost position (n-1) for even n, middle for odd n, and then moves left, then right, etc.\n\nBut let's think of another angle. For each row in the input that's all zeros, the output's 1 is placed in a position that cycles through a certain sequence. The sequence for each n is:\n\nn=2: positions [1,0], repeating every 2 rows.\n\nn=3: positions [1,0,1,2], repeating every 4 rows.\n\nn=4: positions [3,2,1,0,1,2], repeating every 6 rows.\n\nSo the cycle length is 2*(n-1) for each n.\n\nFor n=2, cycle length 2*(2-1)=2 \u2192 positions [1,0].\n\nFor n=3, cycle length 4 \u2192 [1,0,1,2].\n\nFor n=4, cycle length6 \u2192 [3,2,1,0,1,2].\n\nWait, but in Example2 (n=4), the cycle for the first 9 rows (0-8) is:\n\n3,2,1,0,1,2,3,2,1.\n\nWhich is a cycle of 6 steps (3,2,1,0,1,2) and then repeats. But the 9th row (i=8) is position1, which is part of the next cycle.\n\nSo the general formula for the cycle is:\n\ncycle = list(range(n-1, 0, -1)) + list(range(1, n-1))\n\nWait, for n=4, that would be [3,2,1] + [1,2] \u2192 [3,2,1,1,2]. No, that's not matching.\n\nAlternative way: the cycle for n elements is a list that starts at (n-1), decrements to 0, then increments to (n-2), and so on.\n\nFor example:\n\nn=4: 3,2,1,0,1,2,3,2,1,0,...\n\nWait, but in Example2, the cycle for all-zero rows (i=0-8) is:\n\n3,2,1,0,1,2,3,2,1.\n\nSo for cycle length6 (3,2,1,0,1,2). Then the next cycle would start again at3.\n\nBut in Example2's rows 0-8:\n\ni | pos\n\n0:3 \u2192 cycle index0.\n\n1:2 \u2192 index1.\n\n2:1 \u2192 index2.\n\n3:0 \u2192 index3.\n\n4:1 \u2192 index4.\n\n5:2 \u2192 index5.\n\n6:3 \u2192 index0 again (cycle repeats).\n\n7:2 \u2192 index1.\n\n8:1 \u2192 index2.\n\nWhich fits a cycle of 6 steps: [3,2,1,0,1,2].\n\nSo for general n, the cycle is:\n\ncycle = [n-1, n-2, ..., 0, 1, 2, ..., n-2]\n\nSo for n=2: [1,0,1] \u2192 but cycle length2. Wait, no:\n\nFor n=2, the cycle should be [1,0], which is 2 elements.\n\nSo the cycle for n=2 is [1,0].\n\nFor n=3: [2,1,0,1,2] \u2192 but cycle length4. So maybe the cycle is [2,1,0,1], which is 4 elements.\n\nYes, for n=3, the cycle is [2,1,0,1], but in Example1, the positions for all-zero rows start at1. Hmm, this isn't aligning.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the cycle for n is a list that starts at (n-1) and moves down to0, then up to (n-1)-1, then down to0 again, but not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the cycle is generated by a wave that starts at (n-1) and moves left until it hits 0, then moves right until it hits (n-2), then left again, etc. This would create a cycle of length 2*(n-1)-1. For example:\n\nn=2: moves left from1 to0, then right to1 \u2192 cycle [1,0,1], but in Example0, the cycle is [1,0].\n\nHmm. I'm stuck. Let's try to find a formula that works for all examples.\n\nFor Example0 (n=2):\n\nRows 0-8 (9 rows):\n\n0:1 \u21920 mod2=0 \u2192 position1-0=1.\n\n1:0 \u21921 mod2=1 \u21921-1=0.\n\n2:1 \u21922 mod2=0 \u21921.\n\n3:0 \u21923 mod2=1 \u21920.\n\nSo cycle [1,0] for even and odd rows.\n\nFor Example1 (n=3):\n\nRows 0-8 (9 rows):\n\nCycle length is 4 (since 2*(3-1)=4).\n\nFor i in 0-8:\n\ni mod4 \u21920,1,2,3,0,1,2,3,0.\n\nThen, position = (n-1) - (i mod4) if i mod4 < (n-1).\n\nElse, position = (i mod4) - (n-1).\n\nWait for n=3, n-1=2.\n\ni mod4 <2 \u2192 yes for 0,1.\n\nSo for i mod4=0: 2-0=2 \u2192 position2. But row0 of Example1 has position1. So no.\n\nThis approach isn't working.\n\nAlternative idea: For each row i, the position is determined by i modulo (2*(n-1)), which gives a value between0 and 2*(n-1)-1. Then, for each value:\n\nif the value is < (n-1), position is (n-1) - value.\n\nelse, position is value - (n-1).\n\nFor example:\n\nn=2, cycle_length=2*(2-1)=2.\n\nFor i=0: 0 mod2=0 \u2192 position1-0=1.\n\ni=1:1 mod2=1 \u21921-1=0.\n\ni=2:0 \u21921.\n\nWhich matches Example0.\n\nFor n=3, cycle_length=4.\n\ni=0 mod4=0 \u2192 position2-0=2. But in Example1, row0 has position1. So this doesn't match.\n\nHmm. What if for n=3, the cycle_length is 2*(n-2) =2*1=2? No, that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for odd n, the cycle starts at (n//2), and for even n, starts at (n-1). Then the movement alternates between left and right.\n\nBut I need a formula that works for all examples.\n\nAlternative approach: Let's list the positions for each example and see if there's a pattern.\n\nExample0 (n=2):\n\nRow i | pos\n0 |1\n1 |0\n2 |1\n3 |0\n4 |1\n5 |0\n6 |1\n7 |0\n8 |1\n9 |0 (but row9 is handled by input)\n\nSo the pattern for even rows (0,2,4,6,8) is1, for odd rows (1,3,5,7) is0.\n\nWhich can be described as pos = 1 - (i % 2).\n\nExample1 (n=3):\n\nRow i | pos\n0 |1\n1 |0\n2 |1\n3 |2\n4 |1\n5 |0\n6 |1\n7 |2\n8 |1\n\nSo the pattern is:\n\ni mod4 \u21920:1, 1:0, 2:1, 3:2, then repeats.\n\nSo pos = if (i mod4) <3: 1 - (i mod4 %2) ? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively:\n\nFor i=0: pos=1.\n\ni=1:0.\n\ni=2:1.\n\ni=3:2.\n\ni=4:1.\n\ni=5:0.\n\ni=6:1.\n\ni=7:2.\n\ni=8:1.\n\nThis seems like for each group of 4 rows, the positions are 1,0,1,2.\n\nSo for i mod4:\n\n0 \u21921.\n\n1 \u21920.\n\n2 \u21921.\n\n3 \u21922.\n\nThen repeats.\n\nSo pos = [1,0,1,2][i mod4].\n\nBut how to generalize this for any n.\n\nFor n=3, the positions cycle through 1,0,1,2.\n\nFor n=4, the cycle is3,2,1,0,1,2.\n\nSo for each n, the cycle is a sequence that starts at (n-1) and moves left until 0, then right to (n-2), then left again to0, and so on.\n\nSo the cycle for n elements is:\n\npositions = [n-1, n-2, ..., 0, 1, 2, ..., n-2, n-1, n-2, ...]\n\nBut the length of the cycle is 2*(n-1).\n\nSo for n=2: cycle length2: [1,0].\n\nFor n=3: cycle length4: [2,1,0,1].\n\nFor n=4: cycle length6: [3,2,1,0,1,2].\n\nSo the cycle can be generated by:\n\ncycle = list(range(n-1, -1, -1)) + list(range(1, n-1))\n\nSo for n=3:\n\nrange(2, -1, -1) \u2192 2,1,0.\n\nrange(1, 2) \u21921.\n\nSo cycle is [2,1,0,1], which is length4.\n\nFor n=4:\n\nrange(3, -1, -1) \u21923,2,1,0.\n\nrange(1,3) \u21921,2.\n\nSo cycle is [3,2,1,0,1,2], length6.\n\nThus, the cycle for n is generated as follows:\n\ncycle = list(range(n-1, -1, -1)) + list(range(1, n-1))\n\nThe length of the cycle is (n-1) + (n-2) = 2n-3. Wait for n=2, this would be 1+0=1, but earlier for n=2, the cycle length is2. So perhaps this approach is incorrect.\n\nWait, no. For n=2, list(range(1, -1, -1)) is [1,0], and list(range(1,1)) is empty. So cycle is [1,0], length2. Which matches.\n\nFor n=3, the cycle is [2,1,0,1], length4. Which matches the example.\n\nFor n=4, the cycle is [3,2,1,0,1,2], length6.\n\nSo the cycle length is 2*(n-1). Because for n=2: 2*(2-1)=2, cycle length2. n=3: 2*(3-1)=4. n=4: 6.\n\nYes, this seems correct.\n\nThus, the position for row i (all-zero) is cycle[i % cycle_length], where cycle is generated as:\n\ncycle = list(range(n-1, -1, -1)) + list(range(1, n-1))\n\nSo for each n, the cycle is:\n\n- Start from (n-1) and decrement to 0.\n\n- Then increment from 1 to (n-2).\n\nThus, the cycle_length is (n-1) + (n-2) = 2n-3? Wait for n=2: 1+0=1, but cycle length is2. So perhaps the cycle is list(range(n-1, -1, -1)) + list(range(1, n-1)), which for n=2 is [1,0] + list(range(1,1)) \u2192 [1,0], which has length2.\n\nYes, the cycle_length is (n-1) + (n-2) =2n-3 for n\u22652. For n=2, 2n-3=1, but the actual cycle length is2. So perhaps the correct formula is:\n\ncycle = list(range(n-1, -1, -1)) + list(range(1, n-1))\n\nWhich for n=3 gives [2,1,0,1], length4=2*(3-1).\n\nYes, for n=3, cycle length4=2*(n-1).\n\nFor n=4, cycle length6=2*(4-1).\n\nAh, yes! Because list(range(n-1, -1, -1)) has n elements (from n-1 down to0), and list(range(1, n-1)) has n-2 elements. So total elements is n + (n-2) = 2n-2. Wait, for n=2, 2n-2=2 elements. For n=3, 2n-2=4 elements. For n=4, 6 elements. Yes, which matches the examples.\n\nWait, let's calculate:\n\nFor n=2:\n\nlist(range(1, -1, -1)) \u2192 [1,0] (2 elements).\n\nlist(range(1, 1)) \u2192 empty (0 elements).\n\nTotal cycle: 2+0=2 elements.\n\nFor n=3:\n\nrange(2,-1,-1) \u2192 [2,1,0] (3 elements).\n\nrange(1,2) \u2192 [1] (1 element).\n\nTotal:3+1=4=2*3-2=4.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the cycle length is 2*(n-1) elements.\n\nThus, the formula for the position in the cycle is:\n\ncycle = list(range(n-1, -1, -1)) + list(range(1, n-1))\n\nposition = cycle[i % (2*(n-1))]\n\nSo for each all-zero row i, the position is determined by this cycle.\n\nNow, applying this to the test case.\n\nTest input is:\n\n[0,0,0,0,0] (5 elements) for 10 rows, with the last row being [1,0,0,0,0].\n\nSo n=5.\n\nFor the first 9 rows (all-zero), we need to compute the cycle.\n\nThe cycle for n=5:\n\nlist(range(4, -1, -1)) \u2192 [4,3,2,1,0]\n\nlist(range(1,4)) \u2192 [1,2,3]\n\nSo the cycle is [4,3,2,1,0,1,2,3]\n\nWhich has 8 elements (2*(5-1)=8).\n\nFor each row i from0 to8 (9 rows), the positions are:\n\ni | i mod8 | cycle[i mod8]\n\n0 \u21920 \u21924\n\n1 \u21921 \u21923\n\n2 \u21922 \u21922\n\n3 \u21923 \u21921\n\n4 \u21924 \u21920\n\n5 \u21925 \u21921\n\n6 \u21926 \u21922\n\n7 \u21927 \u21923\n\n8 \u21928 mod8=0 \u21924\n\nSo the positions for the first9 rows are:\n\nRow0:4 \u2192 [8,8,8,8,1]\n\nRow1:3 \u2192 [8,8,8,1,8]\n\nRow2:2 \u2192 [8,8,1,8,8]\n\nRow3:1 \u2192 [8,1,8,8,8]\n\nRow4:0 \u2192 [1,8,8,8,8]\n\nRow5:1 \u2192 [8,1,8,8,8]\n\nRow6:2 \u2192 [8,8,1,8,8]\n\nRow7:3 \u2192 [8,8,8,1,8]\n\nRow8:4 \u2192 [8,8,8,8,1]\n\nThen the last row (row9) is [1,0,0,0,0] \u2192 output [1,8,8,8,8].\n\nSo the output should be:\n\nRow0: [8,8,8,8,1]\n\nRow1: [8,8,8,1,8]\n\nRow2: [8,8,1,8,8]\n\nRow3: [8,1,8,8,8]\n\nRow4: [1,8,8,8,8]\n\nRow5: [8,1,8,8,8]\n\nRow6: [8,8,1,8,8]\n\nRow7: [8,8,8,1,8]\n\nRow8: [8,8,8,8,1]\n\nRow9: [1,8,8,8,8]\n\nSo the final output would be these ten rows."
