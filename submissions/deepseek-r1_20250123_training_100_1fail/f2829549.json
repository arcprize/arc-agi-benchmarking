        "cot_1": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. So, we have these input arrays and their corresponding output arrays. The inputs are all lists of 7 numbers, and the outputs are lists of 3 numbers, which are either 0 or 3. Hmm.\n\nLooking at the first example. The input has four rows. Each output row has three elements. Maybe the output is derived by comparing adjacent elements in the input rows? Or perhaps looking at certain positions?\n\nWait, let's take Example 0's input and output. Let's list them:\n\nINPUT:\n[7,7,0,1,5,0,0]\n[7,0,0,1,5,0,0]\n[0,0,0,1,5,0,5]\n[0,0,0,1,5,5,0]\n\nOUTPUT:\n[0,0,3]\n[0,3,3]\n[0,3,0]\n[0,0,3]\n\nLooking at the first input row: [7,7,0,1,5,0,0]. The output is [0,0,3]. How does that happen? Let's check the positions. The input has seven elements, output three. Maybe each output element corresponds to a pair of positions in the input. Like, the first output element could be related to positions 0 and 1, the second to positions 2 and 3, the third to positions 4,5,6? Not sure. Let's check.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is determined by the number of times a certain pattern occurs in the input. For example, if there's a 0 followed by a non-zero in specific positions. Or maybe the presence of 7, 1, 5 in certain positions? Wait, the inputs all have 1 in position 3 (index 3) and 5 in position 4 (index 4). So maybe the 1 and 5 are fixed, and the other numbers vary. So perhaps the output is based on the other numbers.\n\nLooking at example 0's first input row: [7,7,0,1,5,0,0]. The output is [0,0,3]. Maybe each element in the output corresponds to a segment of the input. Like, the first element of the output corresponds to the first two elements (7 and 7), the second to the next two (0 and 1?), but 1 is fixed. Or perhaps the third part of the input after 1 and 5. Let's see.\n\nWait, all input arrays have 1 at index 3 and 5 at index 4. So the structure is: [a, b, c, 1, 5, d, e]. So positions 0,1,2 are variables, then 1,5, then positions 5 and 6. Maybe the output is based on the presence of 7s and 0s in certain positions.\n\nLooking at the output for example 0's first input row: [7,7,0,1,5,0,0] \u2192 [0,0,3]. Let's see. The first three elements are 7,7,0. The next two are 1,5 (fixed). Then 0,0. Hmm. The output is three numbers. Maybe each output element corresponds to a group of elements in the input.\n\nWait, the output has three elements. The input can be split into three parts. Let's think: maybe the first three elements (indices 0-2), then the next two (3-4, which are fixed as 1 and 5), then the last two (indices 5-6). So maybe each part (0-2, 5-6) is considered. But the output has three elements. Alternatively, perhaps the output is determined by the first three elements (indices 0-2), then the fifth element (index 5), then sixth (index 6)? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output elements are determined by the presence of 7s and 0s in certain positions. For example, each output element is 3 if a certain condition is met, else 0. Let's see:\n\nTake Example 0's first output [0,0,3]. The third element is 3. Looking at the input's last two elements (0,0). Maybe if either of them is non-zero? Wait, in this case, both are 0, but output is 3. That doesn't fit. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output counts how many times a 7 is followed by a 0 in certain positions. Wait, but the outputs are 0 or 3. Wait, 3 could be a sum, but not sure. Or maybe it's a binary thing. For example, each position in the output represents a pair of elements in the input, and if the pair is (7,7), (7,0), etc., then 3 is output.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is based on the number of 7s in certain groups. Let's check:\n\nIn Example 0's first input, the first three elements are 7,7,0. Then the next two are 1,5, then 0,0. The output is [0,0,3]. If the first output element corresponds to the first three elements: here, two 7s. But how does that relate to 0? Maybe if the first three elements have at least two 7s, output 0. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each output element represents a group where if there's a 7 followed by a 0, that's a 3. Let's see. For example, in the first input row, the first three elements are 7,7,0. So pairs are 7-7, 7-0. So if the pair transitions from 7 to 0, that's a 3. But then how does that split into three output elements?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each output position corresponds to a specific check. Let's take the output [0,0,3]. Maybe:\n\nFirst position: check if the first element is 7. If yes, 0. But in this case, the first element is 7. Output is 0.\n\nSecond position: check if the second element is 7. Output 0 again. Hmm.\n\nThird position: check if the third element is 0. Output 3. But then why 3?\n\nNot sure. Maybe looking at other examples will help.\n\nTake Example 1's input and output:\n\nINPUT:\n\n[7,7,0,1,5,0,0]\n[0,0,0,1,0,0,0]\n[7,7,0,1,5,0,0]\n[0,7,7,1,5,5,0]\n\nOUTPUT:\n\n[0,0,3]\n[3,3,3]\n[0,0,3]\n[0,0,0]\n\nLooking at the second input row [0,0,0,1,0,0,0]. The output is [3,3,3]. Hmm. So the first three elements are 0,0,0. So maybe if they are all 0s, the output's first elements are 3. But in Example 0's third input row [0,0,0,1,5,0,5], the output is [0,3,0]. Wait, this complicates things.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is based on the presence of 7s and 0s in the first three elements and the last two. Let's try to break down each output element.\n\nFor example, in Example 0's first output [0,0,3], maybe:\n\nFirst element: 0 if the first two elements are both 7s. Because here, first two are 7 and 7. Output 0.\n\nSecond element: 0 if the third element is 0. Because third element is 0, output 0. Wait, but in example 0's second input row [7,0,0,1,5,0,0], the third element is 0, but the output's second element is 3. Hmm, that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each output element corresponds to a check in a triplet. For instance, the three output elements correspond to the first three elements, the next two (but they are fixed as 1 and 5), and the last two elements. But since the middle part is fixed, maybe the output is based on the first three and the last two.\n\nWait, the output has three elements. Let's say:\n\n- First output element: something related to the first three elements (positions 0-2)\n- Second output element: something related to the fifth element (position 5)\n- Third output element: something related to the sixth element (position 6)\n\nBut in Example 0's first output, the third element is 3. The input's fifth and sixth elements are 0 and 0. So maybe if fifth and sixth are both 0, output 3 for third element. But in example 0's third input row, the fifth is 0 and sixth is 5. Output third element is 0. So maybe if fifth is 0 and sixth is non-zero, then 0. If fifth and sixth are both 0, then 3. But then in example 0's fourth input row, fifth is 5 and sixth is 0. The output third element is 3. Hmm, that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the third output element is 3 if either the fifth or sixth is non-zero. Wait, in the first example input's fifth and sixth are 0,0 \u2192 output third element 3. But in the fourth input row, fifth is 5 and sixth is 0. Output third element is 3. So that's 5 (non-zero) and 0. So 3. Hmm. Maybe the third element is 3 if the fifth is non-zero OR the sixth is non-zero. Wait:\n\nFirst input row of example 0: fifth is 0, sixth is 0 \u2192 output third element is 3. Wait that's the opposite. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the third output element is 3 if there's an odd number of non-zeros in positions 5 and 6. First example's 5 and 6 are 0,0 \u2192 0 non-zeros \u2192 maybe 0. But output is 3. So no.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output elements correspond to the number of 7s in certain positions. For example:\n\nFirst output element: number of 7s in positions 0-2.\n\nBut in example 0's first input, positions 0-2 are 7,7,0 \u2192 two 7s. Output first element is 0. Hmm. So maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, the presence of a 0 in a certain position. For example, first output element is 3 if position 0 is 0, else 0. But in example 0's first input, position 0 is 7 \u2192 output is 0. But in example 1's second input row, position 0 is 0 \u2192 output first element is 3. Yes! Let's check:\n\nExample 1's second input row: [0,0,0,1,0,0,0]. The output is [3,3,3]. So first output element is 3 when position 0 is 0. Similarly, example 0's third input row starts with 0 \u2192 output first element is 0. Wait, no. Wait example 0's third input row is [0,0,0,1,5,0,5], and output is [0,3,0]. So first element is 0 even though position 0 is 0. Hmm, so that contradicts the idea.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the first output element is 3 if the first two elements are both 0. Let's see:\n\nExample 0's third input row starts with [0,0,0], so first two are 0. Output first element is 0. So that's not it. Hmm.\n\nAlternative approach: Let's look for a pattern where each output element is 3 if a certain condition is met, else 0. The output has three elements, so three conditions.\n\nLet's check the positions in the input that affect each output element.\n\nLooking at example 0's first output [0,0,3]. Let's see:\n\nInput row: [7,7,0,1,5,0,0]\n\nOutput elements 0,0,3.\n\nWhat's different about the third output element here? The input's fifth and sixth elements are 0,0. So maybe the third output element is 3 when fifth and sixth are both 0. But in example 0's fourth input row, fifth is 5 and sixth is 0. Output third element is 3. So that's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the third output element is 3 if the sixth element is 0. Let's check:\n\nExample 0's first input: sixth is 0 \u2192 third output is 3. Fourth input: sixth is 0 \u2192 third output is 3. Third input: sixth is 5 \u2192 third output is 0. Second input: sixth is 0 \u2192 third output is 3. So that seems to fit. But what about example 1's second input row, sixth is 0. Output third element is 3 (output is [3,3,3]). So yes. And example 1's third input row: sixth is 0 \u2192 third output element is 3. So maybe third output element is 3 if sixth element is 0. Otherwise 0.\n\nWait, but in example 0's third input row, the sixth element is 5 \u2192 output third element is 0. That fits. So that's a possible rule for the third output element: 3 if sixth element is 0, else 0.\n\nNow check the second output element. Let's see:\n\nIn example 0's first input row, the output second element is 0. Let's see what's in the input. The input is [7,7,0,1,5,0,0]. The fifth element is 0. Wait, maybe the second output element is 3 if fifth element is non-zero. Because in example 0's first input, fifth is 0 \u2192 output second element 0. In example 0's second input row, fifth is 0 \u2192 output second element 3. Wait, no. Wait example 0's second input row is [7,0,0,1,5,0,0]. Wait fifth element here is 0. But output second element is 3. So that contradicts.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the second output element is 3 if the fourth element (index 4) is 5. But in all examples, index 4 is 5. So that's fixed. So that can't be it.\n\nHmm. Maybe the second output element is 3 if the third element (index 2) is 0. Let's see:\n\nExample 0's first input, index 2 is 0 \u2192 output second element is 0. No. Wait, output second element here is 0. So that's not it. Example 0's second input, index 2 is 0 \u2192 output second element is 3. So that's inconsistent.\n\nAlternative approach: Let's look for patterns in the output elements across examples. Let's take the third output element first. It seems that whenever the sixth element (index 6) is 0, the third output element is 3. But let's check:\n\nExample 0, first input: 6th is 0 \u2192 3. Second input: 6th is 0 \u2192 3. Third input: 6th is 5 \u2192 0. Fourth input: 6th is 0 \u21923. So that holds. Example 1: first input's sixth is 0 \u21923. Second input's sixth is 0 \u21923. Third input's sixth is 0 \u21923. Fourth input's sixth is 0 \u21920. Wait, example 1's fourth input's sixth element is 0. Output third element is 0. So contradiction.\n\nWait example 1's fourth input row is [0,7,7,1,5,5,0]. Sixth element is 0 \u2192 output third element is 0. So the previous hypothesis is incorrect.\n\nHmm. So maybe it's not just the sixth element. Maybe the fifth and sixth elements together. Let's look at example 1's fourth input row. Fifth element is 5, sixth is 0. Output third element is 0. But in example 0's fourth input row, fifth is 5, sixth is 0 \u2192 output third element is 3. Wait, same input for fifth and sixth elements but different outputs. So that's a problem.\n\nSo maybe the third output element depends on something else. Let's look for another pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the third output element is 3 if the sum of the fifth and sixth elements is even. But example 0 first input: 0+0=0 \u2192 even \u2192 3. Example 0's fourth input:5+0=5 \u2192 odd \u2192 output 3. So no.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the third output element is 3 if there's a 0 in the fifth or sixth positions. Example 0's first input: both 0 \u21923. Fourth input: sixth is 0 \u21923. Example 1's fourth input: fifth is 5, sixth is 0 \u21923, but the output is 0. So no.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Let's think of another approach. Perhaps the output elements correspond to the number of times 7 appears in certain positions.\n\nWait, for example, the first output element could be 3 if there's a 7 in the first position. Let's check:\n\nExample 0's first input starts with 7 \u2192 output first element 0. Example 1's first input starts with 7 \u2192 output first element 0. But example 1's second input starts with 0 \u2192 output first element 3. Example 0's third input starts with 0 \u2192 output first element 0. Hmm, inconsistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the first output element is 3 if the first element is 0. But in example 1's second input, first element is 0 \u2192 output 3. In example 0's third input, first element is 0 \u2192 output 0. So that's not consistent.\n\nHmm. Let's try looking at all output elements and their corresponding input rows for each position. Maybe there's a pattern in the input that leads to 3 in the output.\n\nTake the first output element. Let's list all first output elements and their input rows:\n\nExample 0: first output element is 0. Input row starts with [7,7,0].\n\nExample 0: second input row starts with [7,0,0]. Output first element 0.\n\nExample 0: third input row starts with [0,0,0]. Output first element 0.\n\nExample 0: fourth input row starts with [0,0,0]. Output first element 0.\n\nExample 1: first output element is 0. Input starts with [7,7,0].\n\nExample 1: second input starts with [0,0,0]. Output first element 3.\n\nExample 1: third input starts with [7,7,0]. Output first element 0.\n\nExample 1: fourth input starts with [0,7,7]. Output first element 0.\n\nExample 2: first output element is 0. Input starts with [0,7,7].\n\nExample 2: second input starts with [0,0,7]. Output first element 3.\n\nExample 2: third input starts with [0,7,0]. Output first element 0.\n\nExample 2: fourth input starts with [0,0,7]. Output first element 3.\n\nExample 3: first output element is 0. Input starts with [7,0,7].\n\nExample 3: second input starts with [7,7,0]. Output first element 0.\n\nExample 3: third input starts with [0,7,0]. Output first element 3.\n\nExample 3: fourth input starts with [0,0,0]. Output first element 0.\n\nExample 4: first output element is 0. Input starts with [7,0,0].\n\nExample 4: second input starts with [0,0,7]. Output first element 0.\n\nExample 4: third input starts with [0,0,0]. Output first element 0.\n\nExample 4: fourth input starts with [7,7,7]. Output first element 0.\n\nHmm. So when is the first output element 3? Example 1's second input ([0,0,0] \u2192 3), example 2's second and fourth inputs ([0,0,7] and [0,0,7] \u2192 3), example 3's third input ([0,7,0] \u21923). What's common here?\n\nLooking at example 1's second input starts with three 0s \u2192 first output element 3.\n\nExample 2's second input starts with [0,0,7]. Output first element 3.\n\nExample 2's fourth input starts with [0,0,7]. Output first element 3.\n\nExample 3's third input starts with [0,7,0]. Output first element 3.\n\nSo the first output element is 3 in some cases where the first three elements have certain combinations. Let's see:\n\nLooking for a pattern in the first three elements when first output is 3.\n\nCase 1: [0,0,0] \u2192 output first element 3 (example 1's second input).\n\nCase 2: [0,0,7] \u2192 output first element 3 (example 2's second and fourth inputs).\n\nCase 3: [0,7,0] \u2192 output first element 3 (example 3's third input).\n\nSo perhaps the first output element is 3 if the first three elements have exactly two 0s and one non-zero, or all 0s. Wait, but [0,0,0] has three 0s. Or maybe if there's a 0 in the first position and at least two 0s in the first three elements. Let's check:\n\nIn example 1's second input, first three are all 0s \u2192 first output 3.\n\nIn example 2's second input, first three are 0,0,7 \u2192 two 0s \u2192 first output 3.\n\nIn example 2's fourth input, 0,0,7 \u2192 two 0s \u2192 output 3.\n\nIn example 3's third input, 0,7,0 \u2192 two 0s \u2192 output 3.\n\nSo maybe the first output element is 3 if the first three elements contain two or more 0s. Let's check other cases.\n\nExample 0's third input has three 0s \u2192 first output element 0. But according to this hypothesis, it should be 3. But in example 0's output for the third input row, the first output element is 0. So that contradicts.\n\nHmm. So that's not the pattern. Another idea: maybe the first output element is 3 if the first three elements include a 7 and the rest are 0s. Like, for example, in example 2's second input [0,0,7], there's one 7. Output is 3. In example 3's third input [0,7,0], there's one 7. Output is 3. But example 1's second input has all 0s \u2192 output 3. So perhaps the first output element is 3 if the first three elements have exactly one 7 or all zeros. But example 0's third input has all zeros, but output first element is 0. So that's not it.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the first output element is 3 if the first three elements have an even number of 7s. Let's see:\n\nExample 1's second input: 0 0 0 \u2192 0 7s \u2192 even (0 is even) \u2192 output 3.\n\nExample 2's second input: two 0s and one 7 \u2192 1 seven \u2192 odd \u2192 but output is 3. So that doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. This is tricky. Let's think of another approach. Maybe the output elements correspond to the presence of 7-7, 0-0, etc., in certain positions.\n\nFor example, the first output element is 3 if the first two elements are both 7. But in example 0's first input, first two are 7 and 7 \u2192 output first element is 0. So that's not it.\n\nAlternatively, the first output element is 3 if the first two elements are 0. For example, in example 1's second input, the first two are 0 \u2192 output 3. In example 2's second and fourth inputs, first two are 0 \u2192 output 3. Example 3's third input: first element is 0, second is 7 \u2192 output 3. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the first output element is 3 if the first three elements contain a 7 and a 0 in some pattern. Like, if there's a 0 followed by a 7. Not sure.\n\nLet's look at the second output element. Let's take example 0's second output element in the first row is 0. Input is [7,7,0,1,5,0,0]. The fifth element is 0. In example 0's second input row, output second element is 3. Input is [7,0,0,1,5,0,0], fifth element is 0. So same fifth element, different output. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the second output element is related to the third element of the input. For example, if the third element is 0, output 3. Let's check:\n\nExample 0's first input: third element is 0 \u2192 output second element is 0. No.\n\nExample 0's second input: third element is 0 \u2192 output second element is 3. Yes.\n\nExample 0's third input: third element is 0 \u2192 output second element is 3. Yes.\n\nExample 0's fourth input: third element is 0 \u2192 output second element is 0. No.\n\nSo inconsistency again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the second output element is 3 if the fourth element is 5. But all inputs have 5 in position 4, so that can't explain it.\n\nThis is getting frustrating. Let's try another angle. Maybe the output is determined by comparing the current row with the previous row. Since each example has four input rows and four output rows. Wait, the training examples each have four input rows and four output rows. So each input row is transformed into an output row. So each output row corresponds to one input row.\n\nSo the pattern is per row. Each input row is processed to give an output row of three elements. So for each input row, there's a certain rule that generates the three output elements.\n\nSo perhaps the output is determined by checking certain conditions in each input row, and each output element corresponds to a condition.\n\nLet's take example 0's first input row: [7,7,0,1,5,0,0] \u2192 output [0,0,3].\n\nWhat conditions are met here?\n\nMaybe:\n\n- First output element is 0 if the first two elements are both 7. Else, 3.\n\nWait, first two are 7 and 7 \u2192 output 0. That fits.\n\nSecond output element: maybe 0 if the third element is 0. Here third element is 0 \u2192 output second element 0. But in example 0's second input row, third element is 0 \u2192 output second element 3. So no.\n\nAlternatively, second output element is 3 if the third element is 0 and the fifth element is 0. In example 0's first input row, third element is 0 and fifth is 0 \u2192 output 0. Doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. Let's think of another possible rule. Maybe each output element corresponds to a specific pair of elements in the input:\n\n- First output element: check if positions 0 and 1 are both 7 \u2192 0, else 3.\n\n- Second output element: check if position 2 is 0 \u2192 3, else 0.\n\n- Third output element: check if positions 5 and 6 are both 0 \u2192 3, else 0.\n\nLet's test this.\n\nExample 0's first input:\n\nPositions 0 and 1 are 7,7 \u2192 first output 0.\n\nPosition 2 is 0 \u2192 second output 3.\n\nPositions 5 and 6 are 0,0 \u2192 third output 3.\n\nBut the output is [0,0,3]. So this doesn't match. Second output element would be 3, but it's 0. So this rule is incorrect.\n\nAnother approach: Maybe each output element is 3 if there's a transition from 7 to 0 in certain positions.\n\nFor example:\n\nFirst output element: 3 if position 0 is 7 and position 1 is 0. But in example 0's first input, positions 0 and 1 are 7 and 7 \u2192 output 0. If there's no transition, output 0. Else 3.\n\nSecond output element: 3 if position 1 is 7 and position 2 is 0. In example 0's first input, position 1 is 7 and position 2 is 0 \u2192 output second element would be 3, but actual output is 0. So no.\n\nThird output element: 3 if position 5 is 0 and position 6 is 0. In example 0's first input, yes \u2192 output 3. So that fits.\n\nBut how about the other examples?\n\nExample 0's second input row: [7,0,0,1,5,0,0]. Output [0,3,3].\n\nUsing the third output element rule: positions 5 and 6 are 0,0 \u2192 third output 3. That fits.\n\nSecond output element here is 3. If the second output element is based on position 2 being 0, then 3. But earlier examples don't fit.\n\nWait, if the second output element is 3 if position 2 is 0. In example 0's first input row, position 2 is 0 \u2192 output second element 0. But in example 0's second input row, position 2 is 0 \u2192 output second element 3. So that's inconsistent.\n\nThis is really challenging. Let's try to find another pattern. Maybe the output elements correspond to the number of 7s in specific ranges modulo 2 or something.\n\nAlternatively, think of the output as binary (0 or 3), perhaps representing three binary flags. Let's see:\n\nFor each output element, 3 represents True, 0 represents False.\n\nWhat are the conditions for each flag?\n\nLooking at example 0's first output [0,0,3]. Let's consider:\n\nFlag 1: False\n\nFlag 2: False\n\nFlag 3: True\n\nWhat's different about flag 3? The input's fifth and sixth elements are 0,0. Maybe flag 3 is True if the last two elements are both 0. That seems to fit here. Let's check example 0's fourth input row: fifth is 5, sixth is 0. Output third element is 3. So no. So that's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, flag 3 is True if the sixth element is 0. In example 0's first input, sixth is 0 \u2192 True. Fourth input, sixth is 0 \u2192 True. Third input, sixth is 5 \u2192 False. That fits. But in example 1's fourth input row, sixth is 0 \u2192 output third element is 0. So contradiction.\n\nWait example 1's fourth input row is [0,7,7,1,5,5,0]. Output is [0,0,0]. So sixth element is 0, but output third element is 0. So previous idea is invalid.\n\nHmm. Maybe the third output element is 3 if the fifth element is 0. Let's check:\n\nExample 0's first input: fifth is 0 \u2192 3. Second input: fifth is 0 \u21923. Fourth input: fifth is 5 \u21923. So no.\n\nAlternatively, third output element is 3 if the sixth element is 0 and the fifth element is even. But example 0's fourth input fifth is 5 (odd) \u2192 sixth is 0 \u2192 output third element 3. Doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, third output element is 3 if the sum of fifth and sixth elements is even. Example 0's first input: 0+0=0 \u2192 even \u21923. Fourth input:5+0=5 \u2192 odd \u2192 output 3. So no.\n\nThis is getting me nowhere. Let's think differently. Perhaps the output elements are based on the count of non-zero numbers in certain groups.\n\nFor example:\n\nFirst output element: number of non-zero elements in positions 0-1. If 2, then 0. If 1, then 3. If 0, then 3.\n\nWait example 0's first input has two non-zero in positions 0-1 (7 and7) \u2192 output 0. If the rule is that first output is 0 when there are two non-zero, 3 otherwise. Let's check:\n\nExample 1's second input positions 0-1 are 0,0 \u2192 two zeros \u2192 output first element 3. So rule would be first output is 0 if both are non-zero, else 3. So in example 0's first input, two non-zero \u2192 0. Example 1's second input, two zeros \u21923. Example 2's second input, positions 0-1 are 0,0 \u2192 output first element 3. But example 3's third input positions 0-1 are 0 and7 \u2192 one non-zero \u2192 output first element 3. This fits. Let's test:\n\nFirst output element is 0 only if positions 0 and 1 are both non-zero (and perhaps 7s).\n\nExample 0's first input: yes \u21920. Example 0's second input: positions 0 is7, position 1 is0 \u2192 one non-zero \u2192 output first element 0. But wait, in example 0's second input, the output first element is 0. So this contradicts. Because according to the rule, it should be 3. So no.\n\nHmm. Maybe the first output element is 0 if positions 0 and 1 are both 7. Otherwise 3. Let's check:\n\nExample 0's first input: yes \u21920. Example 0's second input: position 0 is7, position 1 is0 \u2192 not both 7 \u21923. But output is 0. So no.\n\nExample 1's fourth input: positions 0 is0 \u2192 output first element 0. Which would be 3 according to this rule. So no.\n\nAnother Idea: Maybe the output elements are determined by looking at groups of three consecutive elements. For example, the output elements correspond to the presence of 7, 1, 5 in sequence. But 1 and 5 are fixed. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by comparing each of the first three elements with the corresponding element in the next row. But the examples have four input rows and four output rows. Not sure.\n\nWait, looking at example 0's input and output:\n\nINPUT ROWS:\nRow0: [7,7,0,1,5,0,0] \u2192 output [0,0,3]\nRow1: [7,0,0,1,5,0,0] \u2192 output [0,3,3]\nRow2: [0,0,0,1,5,0,5] \u2192 output [0,3,0]\nRow3: [0,0,0,1,5,5,0] \u2192 output [0,0,3]\n\nLooking at the first output elements across rows: 0,0,0,0. So all 0s. But in other examples, the first output elements vary. So this approach may not be helpful.\n\nAnother Idea: The output elements are 3 if a certain triplet of elements in the input sum to a particular value. For example, first three elements sum to 14 (7+7+0=14), but output is 0. Sum of 0's would be 0. So not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the output elements could be based on the presence of 0s in certain positions. For example, first output element is 3 if any of the first three elements is 0. But example 0's first input has a 0 in position 2 \u2192 output first element is 0. So no.\n\nAlternatively, the output elements are determined by the number of 7s in certain positions. For example, first output element is 3 if there's exactly one 7 in the first two positions. Let's see:\n\nExample 0's first input has two 7s \u2192 output 0. Example 1's second input has zero 7s \u2192 output 3. Example 2's fourth input has one 7 in the first three \u2192 output 3. This might fit. For the first output element: 3 if the number of 7s in positions 0-1 is not equal to 2. So if it's 0 or 1, output 3; if it's 2, output 0.\n\nLet's test:\n\nExample 0's first input: two 7s \u2192 output 0. Correct.\n\nExample 1's second input: 0 7s \u2192 output 3. Correct.\n\nExample 2's fourth input: positions 0-1 are 0 and0 \u2192 no 7s \u2192 output 3. But according to the example, the output first element is 3. Correct.\n\nExample 3's third input: positions 0-1 are 0 and7 \u2192 one 7 \u2192 output 3. Correct.\n\nExample 4's fourth input: positions 0-1 are7 and7 \u2192 two 7s \u2192 output first element 0. Correct.\n\nYes! This seems to fit. So first output element is 3 if the number of 7s in positions 0 and 1 is not equal to 2. So if they are 0, 1, or anything else (but in the input, those positions can only be 0 or 7), then output 3. But if both are 7, output 0.\n\nNow for the first output element: yes.\n\nNow the second output element. Let's look for a similar pattern.\n\nLooking at example 0's first output row: second element is 0. Input row's positions 2 is 0. So maybe the second output element is 3 if position 2 is not 0. But in example 0's second input row, position 2 is 0 \u2192 output second element is 3. So no.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the second output element is 3 if position 2 is 7. Let's check:\n\nExample 0's first input: position 2 is 0 \u2192 output 0. Correct.\n\nExample 0's second input: position 2 is 0 \u2192 output 3. No. So that doesn't work.\n\nAlternative approach: Maybe the second output element is 3 if position 5 is 0. Let's see:\n\nExample 0's first input: position 5 is 0 \u2192 output second element 0. No.\n\nExample 0's second input: position 5 is 0 \u2192 output second element 3. Yes.\n\nExample 0's third input: position5 is 0 \u2192 output second element 3. Yes.\n\nExample 0's fourth input: position5 is5 \u2192 output second element 0. Yes.\n\nExample 1's fourth input: position5 is5 \u2192 output second element 0. Yes.\n\nExample 1's second input: position5 is0 \u2192 output second element 3. Yes.\n\nThis seems to fit. So the second output element is 3 if position5 is 0, else 0.\n\nLet's test:\n\nExample 0's first input, position5 is 0 \u2192 output 0. Wait, no. So contradicts.\n\nWait example 0's first input row's output second element is 0. But position5 is 0. So according to this hypothesis, it should be 3. But it's 0. So that's a problem.\n\nHmm. Maybe the second output element is 3 if positions 2 and5 are both 0. Let's check:\n\nExample 0's first input: position2 is0, position5 is0 \u2192 both 0. Output second element 0. No.\n\nExample 0's second input: position2 is0, position5 is0 \u2192 output 3. Yes.\n\nExample 0's third input: position2 is0, position5 is0 \u2192 output 3. Yes.\n\nExample 0's fourth input: position2 is0, position5 is5 \u2192 output 0. Yes.\n\nBut in example 0's first input, both are 0 \u2192 output 0. So why is that? What's different here?\n\nLooking at example 0's first input row: [7,7,0,1,5,0,0]. So positions 0-1 are 7 and7, position2 is0, position5 is0. Output second element is0. But according to the hypothesis, it should be3. So there's something else at play here.\n\nHmm. Maybe the second output element is 3 if position2 is 0 and position5 is 0, but also position0 and/or position1 are not 7. Let's see:\n\nExample 0's first input: positions0 and1 are7 and7, position2 and5 are0. So since positions0 and1 are both 7, even if position2 and5 are0, the second output element is0. But in example 0's second input: positions0 and1 are7 and0, position2 and5 are0. So positions0 and1 are not both 7. So the second output element is3. So perhaps the second output element is3 if position2 and5 are0 and positions0 and1 are not both7.\n\nThat would explain example 0's first input (both 7s and 0s in positions2 and5 \u2192 output0) and example 0's second input (not both 7s \u2192 output3).\n\nLet's test this:\n\nExample 0's third input: positions0 and1 are0 and0 (not both7), positions2 and5 are0 and0 \u2192 output second element3. Yes.\n\nExample 0's fourth input: positions0 and1 are0 and0 (not both7), position2 is0, position5 is5 \u2192 output0. Correct.\n\nExample 1's second input: positions0 and1 are0 and0, positions2 and5 are0 and0 \u2192 output second element3. Yes.\n\nExample 1's fourth input: positions0 and1 are0 and7 \u2192 not both7. position2 is7, position5 is5 \u2192 output0. Correct.\n\nExample 2's second input: positions0 and1 are0 and0, position2 is7, position5 is5 \u2192 output second element0. Correct.\n\nThis seems to fit. So the second output element is3 if:\n\n- position2 is0 AND position5 is0 AND positions0 and1 are not both7.\n\nOtherwise, it's0.\n\nThat's a bit complex, but it explains the examples.\n\nNow, the third output element. Let's see:\n\nIn example 0's first input row, output third element is3. The sixth position is0. So maybe third output is3 if sixth position is0, but there's an exception.\n\nLooking at example 0's fourth input row: sixth position is0 \u2192 output third element3. Yes.\n\nExample 0's third input row: sixth position is5 \u2192 output0. Yes.\n\nExample 1's fourth input row: sixth position is0 \u2192 output third element0. So that's an exception.\n\nWhat's different about example 1's fourth input row? The input row is [0,7,7,1,5,5,0]. So positions5 is5, sixth is0.\n\nAh, maybe the third output element is3 if sixth position is0 AND position5 is0. Let's check:\n\nExample 0's first input: position5 is0, sixth is0 \u21923. Yes.\n\nExample 0's second input: position5 is0, sixth is0 \u21923. Yes.\n\nExample 0's fourth input: position5 is5, sixth is0 \u21920. No. So hypothesis is invalid.\n\nExample 1's fourth input: position5 is5, sixth is0 \u2192 output0. Yes.\n\nExample 3's fourth input row: [0,0,0,1,5,0,5]. position5 is0, sixth is5 \u2192 output third element0. So if position5 is0 and sixth is not0, output0.\n\nHmm. Maybe the third output element is3 if position5 is0 and sixth is0.\n\nExample 0's first input: both0 \u21923. Yes.\n\nExample 0's second input: both0 \u21923. Yes.\n\nExample 0's fourth input: position5 is5, sixth is0 \u21920. Correct.\n\nExample 1's fourth input: position5 is5, sixth is0 \u21920. Correct.\n\nExample 1's third input: position5 is0, sixth is0 \u21923. Yes.\n\nExample 2's third input: position5 is5, sixth is0 \u2192 output third element3. Wait, in example 2's third input row: [0,7,0,1,5,5,0]. Position5 is5, sixth is0. Output third element3. So according to the hypothesis, position5 is5, sixth is0 \u2192 output0. But in reality, output is3. So this hypothesis is incorrect.\n\nHmm. So what's different here? In example 2's third input, position5 is5, sixth is0 \u2192 output third element3.\n\nSo previous idea is incorrect. Let's think again.\n\nLooking at example 2's third input row: [0,7,0,1,5,5,0]. Output third element3. So sixth position is0. So perhaps the third output element is3 if sixth position is0, regardless of position5. But example 1's fourth input row has sixth position0 and output third element0. So contradiction.\n\nAnother Idea: The third output element is3 if the sixth position is0 and there are no 7s in positions5 or6.\n\nWait, example 0's first input row: sixth is0, positions5-6 are0 and0 \u2192 output3. Yes.\n\nExample 0's fourth input row: sixth is0, positions5 is5 \u2192 there's a 5 but no7 \u2192 output3. Yes. But according to the output, it's3. But the actual output is3. So that's correct.\n\nExample 2's third input row: sixth is0, positions5 is5 \u2192 output3. Yes.\n\nExample 1's fourth input row: sixth is0, positions5 is5. But output third element is0. So contradiction.\n\nHmm. Why is example 1's fourth input row's third output element0 when sixth is0?\n\nWait example 1's fourth input row is [0,7,7,1,5,5,0]. Output third element0. So according to the previous idea, sixth is0 \u2192 output3, but here it's0. So there's something else.\n\nAh! Maybe the third output element is3 if sixth position is0 and the third element (position2) is0.\n\nLet's check:\n\nExample 0's first input: sixth is0, position2 is0 \u21923. Yes.\n\nExample 0's fourth input: sixth is0, position2 is0 \u21923. Yes.\n\nExample 2's third input: sixth is0, position2 is0 \u21923. Yes.\n\nExample 1's fourth input: sixth is0, position2 is7 \u2192 output0. Yes.\n\nExample 0's second input: sixth is0, position2 is0 \u21923. Yes.\n\nExample 1's second input: sixth is0, position2 is0 \u21923. Yes.\n\nExample 1's fourth input: position2 is7, sixth is0 \u21920. Correct.\n\nExample 3's fourth input: sixth is5 \u2192 output0. Correct.\n\nYes! So the third output element is3 if position2 is0 and sixth element is0. Otherwise, it's0.\n\nThis seems to fit all the examples.\n\nLet's summarize the rules for each output element:\n\n1. **First output element (O1):** 3 if the number of 7s in positions0 and1 is not 2 (i.e., they are not both 7). Otherwise, 0.\n\n2. **Second output element (O2):** 3 if position2 is0 and position5 is0 and positions0 and1 are not both7. Otherwise, 0.\n\n3. **Third output element (O3):** 3 if position2 is0 and position6 is0. Otherwise, 0.\n\nNow, let's verify these rules against all examples to ensure they hold.\n\n**Example 0:**\n\nInput rows:\n\nRow0: [7,7,0,1,5,0,0]\n\n- O1: positions0-1 are 7 and7 \u2192 both7 \u2192 O1=0.\n\n- O2: position2=0, position5=0, and positions0-1 are both7 \u2192 so condition for O2 is position2 and5 are0 and not both7? Wait, wait. The rule for O2 is:\n\nO2 is3 if position2=0 AND position5=0 AND positions0 and1 are not both7.\n\nIn this case, positions0-1 are both7. So the condition is not met \u2192 O2=0.\n\n- O3: position2=0 and position6=0 \u2192 yes \u2192 O3=3.\n\nOutput row: [0,0,3]. Correct.\n\nRow1: [7,0,0,1,5,0,0]\n\n- O1: positions0-1 are7 and0 \u2192 not both7 \u2192 O1=3. But according to example's output, O1 is0. Wait, contradiction here.\n\nWait example 0's second input row's output is [0,3,3]. So according to the rules, O1 should be3. But the output is0. So this contradicts. So my rules are incorrect.\n\nHmm, this means I've made a mistake in the rules.\n\nLet's re-examine.\n\nIn example 0's second input row: [7,0,0,1,5,0,0].\n\nAccording to the previous rule, O1 is3 because positions0-1 are7 and0 (not both7). But the actual O1 is0. So the rule is wrong.\n\nThis is a problem. So the previous hypothesis is incorrect.\n\nBack to the drawing board. Maybe the first output element is not based on the count of 7s in positions0-1.\n\nAlternative Idea: Maybe the first output element is 3 if position0 is0. Let's check:\n\nExample 0's second input row: position0 is7 \u2192 O1=0. Correct.\n\nExample 1's second input row: position0 is0 \u2192 O1=3. Correct.\n\nExample 2's fourth input row: position0 is0 \u2192 O1=3. Correct.\n\nExample 3's third input row: position0 is0 \u2192 O1=3. Correct.\n\nBut example 0's third input row: position0 is0 \u2192 O1=0. So contradiction.\n\nHmm. So that's not the rule.\n\nAnother Idea: Maybe the first output element is3 if position0 is0 OR position1 is0.\n\nExample 0's third input: positions0 and1 are0 and0 \u2192 O1=0. So no.\n\nExample 1's second input: positions0 and1 are0 and0 \u2192 O1=3. So that fits.\n\nExample 0's second input: position0 is7, position1 is0 \u2192 O1=0 (actual output), but according to this rule, it should be3. So contradiction.\n\nAnother Idea: Maybe the first output element is3 if there is a 0 in positions0-1.\n\nExample 0's second input: position1 is0 \u2192 O1=3. But actual output is0. So no.\n\nHmm. I'm stuck again.\n\nLet's look at example 0's second input row: [7,0,0,1,5,0,0]. Output is [0,3,3]. \n\nAccording to the previous incorrect rules, O1 should be3 but it's0. So what's different here? How can we explain O1 being0?\n\nLooking at this row's positions0-1:7 and0. So if the rule is O1 is0 only if positions0-1 are both7, otherwise3. Then in this case, O1 should be3, but it's0. So that's not it.\n\nAlternative Idea: Maybe the first output element is0 if position0 is7, regardless of position1. But in example 0's second input, position0 is7 \u2192 O1=0. Example 1's fourth input: position0 is0 \u2192 O1=0. So no.\n\nWait example 1's fourth input row: [0,7,7,1,5,5,0]. O1 is0. According to this rule, position0 is0 \u2192 O1 should be3. So no.\n\nAnother Idea: Maybe the first output element is0 if either position0 or position1 is7. So if at least one of them is7, then0. Otherwise3.\n\nLet's test:\n\nExample 0's first input: both7 \u21920. Correct.\n\nExample 0's second input: position0 is7 \u21920. Correct.\n\nExample 1's second input: neither is7 \u21923. Correct.\n\nExample 2's second input: neither is7 \u21923. Correct.\n\nExample 3's third input: position1 is7 \u21920. But according to example 3's third output, O1 is3. So contradiction.\n\nExample 3's third input row: [0,7,0,1,0,0,0]. O1 is3. According to this rule, position1 is7 \u2192 O1=0. So rule is incorrect.\n\nHmm.\n\nAnother Idea: Perhaps the first output element is3 if position0 is0 AND position1 is0. Otherwise0.\n\nExample 0's third input row: positions0 and1 are0 and0 \u2192 O1=0. So no.\n\nExample 1's second input row: positions0 and1 are0 and0 \u2192 O1=3. Correct.\n\nExample 2's second input row: positions0 and1 are0 and0 \u2192 O1=3. Correct.\n\nExample 3's third input row: positions0 is0, position1 is7 \u2192 O1=0. Correct.\n\nExample 0's second input row: positions0 is7, position1 is0 \u2192 O1=0. Correct.\n\nExample 1's fourth input row: positions0 is0, position1 is7 \u2192 O1=0. Correct.\n\nExample 2's fourth input row: positions0 and1 are0 and0 \u2192 O1=3. Correct.\n\nThis seems to work. Let's test:\n\n- O1 is3 if positions0 and1 are both0. Otherwise0.\n\nYes! Let's verify:\n\nExample 0's first input: [7,7,0,...] \u2192 O1=0. Correct.\n\nExample 0's second input: [7,0,0,...] \u2192 O1=0. Correct.\n\nExample 0's third input: [0,0,0,...] \u2192 O1=0. But according to this rule, it should be3. So contradiction.\n\nWait example 0's third input row: [0,0,0,1,5,0,5]. Output O1 is0. According to the rule, since positions0 and1 are0 and0 \u2192 O1 should be3. But actual O1 is0. So this rule is incorrect.\n\nHmm. So back to square one.\n\nAt this point, I realize I might need to think differently. Perhaps each output element corresponds to the number of zeros in a certain group.\n\nFor example, first output element: number of zeros in positions0-1.\n\nIf it's two, output3. Else0.\n\nExample 0's third input: positions0-1 are0 \u2192 output O1=0. So no.\n\nExample 1's second input: positions0-1 are0 \u2192 output3. Correct.\n\nExample 0's second input: positions0 is7, position1 is0 \u2192 one zero \u2192 output0. Correct.\n\nExample 2's fourth input: positions0-1 are0 \u2192 output3. Correct.\n\nExample 3's third input: positions0-1 are0 and7 \u2192 one zero \u2192 output0. Correct.\n\nExample 0's third input: positions0-1 are0 and0 \u2192 output3. But actual O1 is0. So contradiction.\n\nThis suggests that the first output element is3 only when positions0-1 are both0.\n\nExample 0's third input has positions0-1 as0 and0 \u2192 O1=0. But according to this rule, it should be3. So contradiction.\n\nThis is really challenging. I think I need to try a different approach. Let's look at all the training examples and see if I can find a pattern that fits.\n\nLooking at the outputs:\n\nIn example 0, the first output element is0 in all four rows.\n\nIn example 1, the first output element is0,3,0,0.\n\nIn example 2, it's0,3,0,3.\n\nIn example 3, it's0,0,3,0.\n\nIn example 4, it's0,0,0,0.\n\nLooking for patterns in the first output element:\n\nIt's 3 only when the first two elements are both0. But in example 0's third input, first two are0 but output is0. So that's not it.\n\nAnother Idea: The first output element is3 if the first three elements contain exactly two zeros. Let's check:\n\nExample 1's second input: first three are0,0,0 \u2192 three zeros \u2192 output3. No, according to the rule it's three zeros. So no.\n\nExample 2's fourth input: first three are0,0,7 \u2192 two zeros \u2192 output3. Yes.\n\nExample 3's third input: first three are0,7,0 \u2192 two zeros \u2192 output3. Yes.\n\nExample 0's third input: three zeros \u2192 output0. So no.\n\nHmm.\n\nPerhaps the first output element is3 if the first three elements have at least two zeros and at least one non-zero. But in example 1's second input, three zeros \u2192 output3. So that's not it.\n\nAnother Idea: Maybe the first output element is3 if position0 is0 and position1 is0. Otherwise0. But example 0's third input has both0 \u2192 output0. So no.\n\nThis is really tough. I think I'm missing something obvious.\n\nLet's try to look for the third output element first, which seemed to have a possible pattern of being3 when position2 is0 and position6 is0.\n\nChecking example 1's fourth input row:\n\nInput: [0,7,7,1,5,5,0]. Position2 is7, position6 is0 \u2192 O3=0. Correct.\n\nExample 2's third input row: position2 is0, position6 is0 \u2192 O3=3. Correct.\n\nExample 3's fourth input row: position2 is0, position6 is5 \u2192 O3=0. Correct.\n\nExample 4's first input row: position2 is0, position6 is0 \u2192 O3=3. Correct.\n\nExample 4's second input row: position2 is7, position6 is0 \u2192 O3=0. Correct.\n\nSo the third output element is3 only if position2 is0 and position6 is0. Otherwise0. This seems to hold.\n\nNow, the second output element.\n\nLooking for when it's3:\n\nExample 0's second input row: O2=3. Position2=0, position5=0.\n\nExample 0's third input row: O2=3. Position2=0, position5=0.\n\nExample 1's second input row: O2=3. Position2=0, position5=0.\n\nExample 2's fourth input row: O2=0. Position2=7, position5=0.\n\nExample 3's third input row: O2=0. Position2=0, position5=0. Wait, but output is third element of example 3's third input row's output is3. Wait no, example 3's third input row's output is [3,0,3]. So the second output element is0. Hmm.\n\nWait in example 3's third input row: positions2=0, position5=0. So according to previous possible rule, O2 should be3. But actual output is0. So contradiction.\n\nSo previous idea is incorrect.\n\nAnother Idea: Maybe O2 is3 if position2 is0 and position5 is0, and position0 is not7.\n\nBut example 0's second input row: position0 is7, position2=0, position5=0. O2=3. So contradicts.\n\nAlternatively, O2 is3 if position2=0 and position5=0, and position1 is not7.\n\nBut example 0's second input row: position1=0. So O2=3. Correct. But example 3's third input row: position2=0, position5=0, position1=7. So O2=0. Correct.\n\nThis seems to fit.\n\nSo O2 is3 if position2=0 and position5=0 and position1 is not7.\n\nLet's test:\n\nExample 0's second input row: position2=0, position5=0, position1=0 \u2192 not7 \u2192 O2=3. Correct.\n\nExample 0's third input row: position2=0, position5=0, position1=0 \u2192 O2=3. Correct.\n\nExample 1's second input row: position1=0 \u2192 O2=3. Correct.\n\nExample 3's third input row: position1=7 \u2192 O2=0. Correct.\n\nExample 0's first input row: position1=7 \u2192 O2=0. Correct.\n\nExample 2's fourth input row: position2=7 \u2192 O2=0. Correct.\n\nYes! This rule works.\n\nSo:\n\n- O2 is3 if position2=0, position5=0, and position1 is not7. Else,0.\n\nNow, for the first output element. Let's find a pattern.\n\nLooking at when O1 is3:\n\nExample 1's second input row: O1=3. Input starts with [0,0,0].\n\nExample 2's second input row: O1=3. Input starts with [0,0,7].\n\nExample 2's fourth input row: O1=3. Input starts with [0,0,7].\n\nExample 3's third input row: O1=3. Input starts with [0,7,0].\n\nExample 4's first input row: O1=0. Input starts with [7,0,0].\n\nExample 4's second input row: O1=0. Input starts with [0,0,7].\n\nExample 3's first input row: O1=0. Input starts with [7,0,7].\n\nLooking for a pattern, O1 is3 when position0 is0 and position2 is0. But example 2's second input row starts with [0,0,7], position2 is7 \u2192 O1=3. So no.\n\nAlternative Idea: O1 is3 if position0 is0 and position1 is0. Let's check:\n\nExample 1's second input: yes \u2192 O1=3.\n\nExample 2's second input: yes \u2192 O1=3.\n\nExample 2's fourth input: yes \u2192 O1=3.\n\nExample 3's third input: position0 is0, position1 is7 \u2192 O1=3. So no.\n\nHmm. So that's not it.\n\nAlternative Idea: O1 is3 if position0 is0. Let's check:\n\nExample 1's second input: yes \u21923.\n\nExample 2's second and fourth inputs: yes \u21923.\n\nExample 3's third input: yes \u21923.\n\nExample 0's third input: yes \u21920. Contradiction.\n\nSo no.\n\nAnother Idea: O1 is3 if position0 is0 and position1 is not7.\n\nExample 1's second input: position0=0, position1=0 \u2192 O1=3. Correct.\n\nExample 2's second input: position0=0, position1=0 \u2192 O1=3. Correct.\n\nExample 3's third input: position0=0, position1=7 \u2192 not7 \u2192 O1=3. Correct.\n\nExample 0's third input: position0=0, position1=0 \u2192 O1=0. Contradiction.\n\nHmm. So why is example 0's third input row's O1=0?\n\nLooking at example 0's third input row: [0,0,0,1,5,0,5]. Output O1=0. According to this rule, position0 is0 and position1 is0 \u2192 O1=3. But actual output is0.\n\nSo this rule is invalid.\n\nAnother Idea: Maybe O1 is3 if position0 is0 and at least one of position1 or position2 is0.\n\nExample 1's second input: position0=0, positions1 and2 are0 \u2192 O1=3. Correct.\n\nExample 2's second input: position0=0, position1=0, position2=7 \u2192 O1=3. Correct.\n\nExample 3's third input: position0=0, position1=7, position2=0 \u2192 O1=3. Correct.\n\nExample 0's third input: position0=0, positions1 and2 are0 \u2192 O1=3. But actual O1=0. Contradiction.\n\nHmm.\n\nAnother Idea: O1 is3 if position0 is0 and position2 is0.\n\nExample 1's second input: position0=0, position2=0 \u2192 O1=3. Correct.\n\nExample 0's third input: position0=0, position2=0 \u2192 O1=0. Contradiction.\n\nExample 3's third input: position0=0, position2=0 \u2192 O1=3. Correct.\n\nExample 2's fourth input: position0=0, position2=7 \u2192 O1=3. So no.\n\nThis is not working.\n\nPerhaps the first output element is3 if position0 is0 and there are no 7s in positions0-2.\n\nExample 1's second input: positions0-2 are0,0,0 \u2192 O1=3. Correct.\n\nExample 2's second input: positions0-2 are0,0,7 \u2192 contains7 \u2192 O1=3. Contradiction.\n\nExample 3's third input: positions0-2 are0,7,0 \u2192 contains7 \u2192 O1=3. Contradiction.\n\nSo no.\n\nThis is taking too long, and I need to provide an answer. Let's summarize the rules I have so far:\n\n1. **First output element (O1):** I'm stuck. Can't find a consistent rule.\n\n2. **Second output element (O2):** 3 if position2 is0, position5 is0, and position1 is not7. Else0.\n\n3. **Third output element (O3):** 3 if position2 is0 and position6 is0. Else0.\n\nFor the test input:\n\nTest Input:\nRow0: [0,0,0,1,0,5,0]\nRow1: [7,7,7,1,5,5,0]\nRow2: [0,0,0,1,5,0,0]\nRow3: [7,0,0,1,5,5,5]\n\nApply the known rules for O2 and O3:\n\nRow0:\n\n- O2: position2=0, position5=5, position1=0 (not7). But position5=5, so O2=0.\n\n- O3: position2=0, position6=0 \u2192 O3=3.\n\nRow1:\n\n- O2: position2=7, so O2=0.\n\n- O3: position2=7 \u2192 O3=0.\n\nRow2:\n\n- O2: position2=0, position5=0, position1=0 (not7) \u2192 O2=3.\n\n- O3: position2=0, position6=0 \u2192 O3=3.\n\nRow3:\n\n- O2: position2=0, position5=5 \u2192 O2=0.\n\n- O3: position2=0, position6=5 \u2192 O3=0.\n\nFor O1, let's try to find a pattern based on the test input.\n\nTest Row0: [0,0,0,1,0,5,0]. If O1 is3 when position0 is0 and position1 is0. Which they are. So O1=3.\n\nBut according to example 0's third input, which has the same first two elements, O1=0. So this contradicts.\n\nAlternative Idea: Perhaps O1 is3 if position0 is0 and position4 is0. Because in example 1's second input, position4 is0 \u2192 O1=3. In test row0, position4 is0 \u2192 O1=3.\n\nLet's see:\n\nTest Row0: position4 is0 \u2192 O1=3.\n\nTest Row1: position4 is5 \u2192 O1=0.\n\nTest Row2: position4 is5 \u2192 O1=0.\n\nTest Row3: position4 is5 \u2192 O1=0.\n\nBut I'm not sure if this is correct. For example, example 1's second input has position4=0 \u2192 O1=3. Example 0's third input has position4=5 \u2192 O1=0. So maybe O1 is3 if position0 is0 and position4 is0.\n\nThis would explain:\n\nTest Row0: O1=3.\n\nTest Row1: O1=0.\n\nTest Row2: O1=0.\n\nTest Row3: O1=0.\n\nBut let's check the training examples:\n\nExample 1's second input: position0=0, position4=0 \u2192 O1=3. Correct.\n\nExample 0's third input: position0=0, position4=5 \u2192 O1=0. Correct.\n\nExample 4's second input: position0=0, position4=5 \u2192 O1=0. Correct.\n\nExample 3's third input: position0=0, position4=0 \u2192 O1=3. But according to the example's output, O1 is3. Correct.\n\nExample 2's second input: position0=0, position4=0 \u2192 O1=3. Correct.\n\nYes! So the rule for O1 is3 if position0 is0 and position4 is0. Else0.\n\nLet's verify:\n\nExample 1's second input: position0=0, position4=0 \u2192 O1=3. Correct.\n\nExample 0's third input: position0=0, position4=5 \u2192 O1=0. Correct.\n\nExample 3's third input: position0=0, position4=0 \u2192 O1=3. Correct.\n\nExample 2's second input: position0=0, position4=0 \u2192 O1=3. Correct.\n\nExample 2's fourth input: position0=0, position4=0 \u2192 O1=3. Correct.\n\nExample 4's second input: position0=0, position4=5 \u2192 O1=0. Correct.\n\nExample 4's first input: position0=7, position4=0 \u2192 O1=0. Correct.\n\nYes! This rule works.\n\nSo the final rules are:\n\n1. **First output element (O1):** 3 if position0 is0 and position4 is0. Else0.\n\n2. **Second output element (O2):** 3 if position2 is0, position5 is0, and position1 is not7. Else0.\n\n3. **Third output element (O3):** 3 if position2 is0 and position6 is0. Else0.\n\nNow, applying these rules to the test input:\n\nTest Input:\n\nRow0: [0,0,0,1,0,5,0]\n\n- O1: position0=0, position4=0 \u21923.\n\n- O2: position2=0, position5=5 \u21920.\n\n- O3: position2=0, position6=0 \u21923.\n\nOutput: [3,0,3]\n\nRow1: [7,7,7,1,5,5,0]\n\n- O1: position0=7 \u21920.\n\n- O2: position2=7 \u21920.\n\n- O3: position2=7 \u21920.\n\nOutput: [0,0,0]\n\nRow2: [0,0,0,1,5,0,0]\n\n- O1: position0=0, position4=5 \u21920.\n\n- O2: position2=0, position5=0, position1=0 (not7) \u21923.\n\n- O3: position2=0, position6=0 \u21923.\n\nOutput: [0,3,3]\n\nRow3: [7,0,0,1,5,5,5]\n\n- O1: position0=7 \u21920.\n\n- O2: position2=0, position5=5 \u21920.\n\n- O3: position2=0, position6=5 \u21920.\n\nOutput: [0,0,0]\n\nSo the final output for the test input should be:\n\n[3,0,3]\n\n[0,0,0]\n\n[0,3,3]\n\n[0,0,0]\n\nBut looking at the training examples, outputs are always sequences of 0 and3. Let me check if any of the training examples have similar outputs.\n\nFor example, example 0's output has [0,0,3], [0,3,3], [0,3,0], [0,0,3]. So the format is correct.\n\nThus, applying the rules to the test input gives the following outputs:\n\nRow0: [3,0,3]\n\nRow1: [0,0,0]\n\nRow2: [0,3,3]\n\nRow3: [0,0,0]\n\nBut I need to check if this matches any of the training examples' patterns.\n\nHowever, the user provided the training examples in a specific format, and the outputs are within the examples. But according to the rules I derived, this should be the correct answer.",

        "cot_2": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. So, each input consists of four lists of seven numbers each, and the output is three elements. The numbers in the input seem to be a mix of 0, 1, 5, 7, and maybe some others. The outputs are all 0s and 3s. Hmm.\n\nLooking at the training examples, maybe the output is derived from comparing the four input lists in some way. Since each output has three elements, perhaps each element in the output corresponds to a pair of the input lists. Like, maybe comparing each consecutive pair of the four lists and checking something between them.\n\nLet's take Example 0. The input lists are:\n\n1. [7,7,0,1,5,0,0]\n2. [7,0,0,1,5,0,0]\n3. [0,0,0,1,5,0,5]\n4. [0,0,0,1,5,5,0]\n\nOutput: [0,0,3], [0,3,3], [0,3,0], [0,0,3]\n\nWait, each output list has three elements. Maybe each element in the output list corresponds to a position in the input lists. Let's check positions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe for each of the four input lists, the output is generated by looking at the number of times certain conditions are met across the elements. But the outputs are four lists, each with three elements, but the examples have four input lists and four output lists. Wait, no, in the first example, the input is four lists and the output is four lists. So each input list corresponds to an output list? Or perhaps the output is generated by comparing adjacent input lists.\n\nWait, let me check. For example, in Example 0:\n\nINPUT lists are four. OUTPUT lists are four. Each output list has three elements. So perhaps each output list is derived from a single input list. Let's take the first input list in Example 0: [7,7,0,1,5,0,0]. The corresponding output is [0,0,3]. How?\n\nLooking at the input list, maybe the three elements in the output correspond to some transformation of the first three elements of the input list. But 7,7,0 to 0,0,3? Not sure. Alternatively, maybe the output is based on some count or positions where certain numbers appear.\n\nAnother approach: the outputs are 0 and 3. Maybe 3 represents a certain condition being met. Let's see if there's a pattern when a 3 appears.\n\nTake Example 0's first output [0,0,3]. Let's compare the first input list [7,7,0,1,5,0,0] with the others. Wait, but each output list is part of the entire example. Maybe the four output lists are each generated by comparing adjacent input lists. Since there are four input lists, maybe three comparisons (since 4 lists would have 3 pairs), but the outputs have four lists each with three elements. Hmm, that doesn't fit. Alternatively, perhaps each output list corresponds to one of the four input lists, but how?\n\nWait, maybe each position in the output list corresponds to a triplet of positions in the input lists. For example, the first element of each output list could be based on the first three elements of the input list, the second on the next three, etc. But the input lists are length seven, which isn't divisible by three. So that might not work.\n\nAnother idea: Maybe each element in the output is determined by the presence of 7s and 5s in certain positions. Looking at the input lists, 1 is in the fourth position of every input list. Maybe 1 is a separator, and the elements before and after are considered separately.\n\nWait, in all input lists, the fourth element is 1. So maybe the first three elements and the last three elements (since the list is seven elements long) are the ones being considered. Let's check:\n\nTake Example 0's first input list: [7,7,0,1,5,0,0]. The first three elements are 7,7,0. The last three are 5,0,0. The output is [0,0,3]. Maybe each output element corresponds to something in these parts.\n\nLooking at the output, 3s appear. Let's see if when there's a 5 or 7 in certain positions, it affects the output. For example, in the first input list of Example 0, the last three elements are 5,0,0. The third element of the output is 3. Maybe the presence of 5 in the fifth position (which is part of the last three) contributes to the third output element being 3.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output counts the number of 7s and 5s in certain parts. But how?\n\nWait, let's take Example 0's first output [0,0,3]. The input list has first three elements [7,7,0], then 1, then [5,0,0]. Maybe the output's elements correspond to the first three positions, then the middle (position 4 is 1, maybe ignored), then the last three. But how does that produce three elements in the output? Maybe the output elements are for the first three positions, then the next three (positions 5,6,7?), but that's three positions again.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is based on the number of non-zero digits in specific parts. Let's see:\n\nFor the first input list of Example 0: [7,7,0,1,5,0,0]. The first three elements have two 7s and one 0. The last three are 5,0,0. Maybe the output counts the non-zero digits in these regions. But the output is [0,0,3]. That doesn't match. Alternatively, the number of 7s and 5s in certain positions.\n\nLooking at Example 0's output again. The first output list is [0,0,3]. Let's check the first input list's last three elements: 5,0,0. There's one 5. But the output's third element is 3. Maybe the count is transformed in some way. If the count is 1, it's 3. But how?\n\nAlternatively, the output could be based on whether the positions after the 1 (positions 5,6,7) have 5s. For example, in the first input list of Example 0, position 5 is 5, positions 6 and 7 are 0. So maybe the output's third element is 3 if there's a 5 in position 5. But then in the first input list of Example 0, the third element of the output is 3. That seems possible. Then the first and second elements of the output would correspond to the first three elements before the 1.\n\nWait, the first three elements are before the 1 (positions 1-3), then the 1 is position 4, then positions 5-7. So perhaps each output list's three elements correspond to:\n\n1. Whether there are 7s in the first three positions (before the 1)\n2. Whether there are 5s in the last three positions (after the 1)\n3. Some combination or another rule.\n\nWait, but the output elements are 0 or 3. So maybe each element in the output represents whether a certain condition is met in the corresponding part of the input list.\n\nLet's take the first input list of Example 0: [7,7,0,1,5,0,0]. The first three elements are 7s and a 0. The output is [0,0,3]. If the first output element is checking if all first three elements are 7s, but here two are 7s and one is 0. So that's not. Alternatively, the presence of 7s. Maybe the first output element is 3 if all three are 7s. Here, two 7s, so 0. That fits the first element being 0. The second element could be checking the middle part (maybe the 1?), but the 1 is fixed. The third element: in the last three positions (5,0,0), there's one 5. Maybe the third output element is 3 if there's at least one 5 in the last three. Here, yes, so 3. That explains the third element being 3. Then what about the second element? The output has [0,0,3], so the second element is 0. What's the second element checking?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the three output elements correspond to:\n\n1. The number of 7s in the first three positions (if any, maybe converted to 3)\n2. The number of 5s in the last three positions (converted to 3)\n3. Something else.\n\nBut in Example 0's first input, the first three have two 7s, but the output's first element is 0. So that's not directly a count. Alternatively, maybe 3 is present if all three positions meet a certain condition.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each output element is 3 if the corresponding part (like first three elements, then positions 4-6, then positions 5-7) sum to a certain value. But that's getting complicated.\n\nWait, looking at Example 1:\n\nInput:\n\n[7,7,0,1,5,0,0]\n[0,0,0,1,0,0,0]\n[7,7,0,1,5,0,0]\n[0,7,7,1,5,5,0]\n\nOutput:\n\n[0,0,3]\n[3,3,3]\n[0,0,3]\n[0,0,0]\n\nThe second input list is [0,0,0,1,0,0,0]. The output for this is [3,3,3]. Hmm, but the first three elements are all 0, and the last three are all 0. So why would all three elements be 3? That contradicts the earlier idea where the third element is 3 if there's a 5 in the last three. Here, there are no 5s, but the output is all 3s. So that suggests my previous thought was wrong.\n\nWait, maybe it's the other way around. Maybe 3 is present when there are no 5s or 7s in certain parts. Let's think again.\n\nIn Example 1's second input list [0,0,0,1,0,0,0], the output is [3,3,3]. All elements are 3. The first three are all 0, the last three are all 0. So maybe if a section (like first three, middle three, last three) has all zeros, then the output is 3 for that position. Wait, but the sections would be first three, positions 2-4 (but position 4 is 1), or perhaps first three, then the three after the 1. Let me see.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the first three elements (positions 0-2) and the last three (positions 4-6) are considered. The middle is position 3 (which is always 1). So for each input list, the first three and last three are checked. But the output has three elements. Maybe each output element corresponds to a check between the first three and the last three. Wait, three elements could be:\n\n1. Check first three (0-2)\n2. Check middle (positions 3 is 1)\n3. Check last three (4-6)\n\nBut the middle is always 1, so maybe that's ignored. Or perhaps the three elements are for the three possible pairs between the four lists? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, considering that the output lists have three elements, perhaps each element in the output corresponds to a comparison between adjacent input lists for a specific position.\n\nWait, but each output list is associated with an input list. Let me look at the structure again. Each example's input is four lists, each of seven elements, and the output is four lists, each of three elements. So each input list is mapped to an output list of three elements.\n\nSo for each input list, how do we get three elements in the output? Let's take Example 0's first input list: [7,7,0,1,5,0,0], output [0,0,3].\n\nLooking for a pattern in the elements:\n\nThe input list has 7s in the first two positions, 0 in the third, 1 in the fourth, then 5, 0, 0.\n\nIf the output is generated by looking at the presence of 7s and 5s in specific positions.\n\nMaybe the three elements in the output correspond to:\n\n1. The number of 7s in the first three positions (before the 1) divided by something. But in this case, two 7s, but output is 0.\n2. The presence of 5 in the fifth position (position 4, index 4 in zero-based). Here, there is a 5, but the second output element is 0.\n3. The third element of the output could be the count of 5s in the last three positions (positions 5,6,7). Here, there's one 5 in position 4 (wait, position indices are 0-6). Wait, the input list is [7,7,0,1,5,0,0]. So positions 0:7, 1:7, 2:0, 3:1, 4:5, 5:0, 6:0. So the last three positions are 5,0,0. Wait, no. The seventh element is index 6. So positions 4,5,6: 5,0,0. So the last three are 5,0,0.\n\nIn the first input list of Example 0, the output is [0,0,3]. So maybe the third element is 3 if there's a 5 in position 4. But position 4 is part of the last three. But in this case, position 4 is 5. So if there's a 5 in position 4, then third element is 3. Then, if there's a 5 in position 5 or 6, maybe that adds more. But in the third input list of Example 0: [0,0,0,1,5,5,0], output [0,3,0]. Wait, positions 4:5, 5:5, 6:0. So two 5s here. Output is [0,3,0]. Hmm, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each element in the output corresponds to a specific position after the 1. For example:\n\n- The first output element checks position 4 (5 in the first input list of Example 0) \u2192 if it's 5, maybe 3.\n- The second output element checks position 5 (0 here) \u2192 0.\n- The third output element checks position 6 (0 here) \u2192 0.\n\nBut the output is [0,0,3], so that doesn't fit. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the three output elements are the counts of 7s before the 1, 5s after the 1, and something else. Let's see:\n\nFirst input list of Example 0: two 7s before 1, one 5 after. Output [0,0,3]. If the first element is the count of 7s (mod 3?), but two 7s would be 0 (since 2 mod 3 is 2, but output is 0). Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, each 7 before the 1 converts to a 0 in the first output element, and each 5 after converts to a 3. But in the first input list of Example 0, two 7s (first output 0?), one 5 (third output 3?), but there are three output elements. Maybe:\n\n- First output element: 3 if all three elements before 1 are 7s. Here, two 7s and a 0 \u2192 0.\n- Second output element: 3 if all elements after 1 (positions 4-6) are 5s. Here, positions 4 is 5, 5 and 6 are 0 \u2192 0.\n- Third output element: 3 if there's at least one 5 in positions 4-6. Here, yes \u2192 3. That would explain [0,0,3].\n\nLet's test this hypothesis with other examples.\n\nTake Example 0's second input list: [7,0,0,1,5,0,0]. Output is [0,3,3].\n\n- First three elements: 7,0,0. Not all 7s \u2192 0.\n- Positions 4-6: 5,0,0. Not all 5s \u2192 second output should be 0. But output is [0,3,3]. Wait, that doesn't fit. Hmm. Maybe my hypothesis is wrong.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the second output element is 3 if there's at least one 5 in positions 4-6, and the third element is something else. Let me think again.\n\nIn Example 1's second input list: [0,0,0,1,0,0,0]. Output is [3,3,3]. According to the earlier hypothesis:\n\n- All three elements before 1 are 0 (not 7s) \u2192 first output element would be 0. But output is 3 here. So that contradicts.\n\nHmm. Let's think differently. Maybe the output elements are determined by the number of non-zero elements in certain regions. For example, in the first input list of Example 0, the first three elements have two 7s (non-zero), so first output element could be 3 if there are non-zero numbers. But in Example 1's second input, the first three are zeros, so output is 3. That's the opposite. So maybe 3 is present when the region is all zeros.\n\nIn Example 0's first input list: first three are [7,7,0] \u2192 not all zeros \u2192 first output element 0. In Example 1's second input list: first three are zeros \u2192 output element 3. That fits. Then maybe the first output element is 3 if the first three elements are all zeros, else 0. Similarly, the second output element is 3 if positions 4-6 (after the 1) are all zeros, and third element is something else. Wait, but Example 0's first input list's positions 4-6 are [5,0,0] \u2192 not all zeros. So second output element is 0, which fits. Third output element: in Example 0's first input, the third output element is 3. What's the third element's condition?\n\nMaybe third element is 3 if there's a 5 in the positions 4-6. In Example 0's first input list, positions 4 is 5 \u2192 yes, so 3. In Example 1's second input list, positions 4-6 are zeros \u2192 no 5 \u2192 third output element would be 0, but in that case the output is [3,3,3], which contradicts.\n\nWait, in Example 1's second input list, the output is [3,3,3]. According to this new hypothesis:\n\n- First three elements are all zeros \u2192 first element 3.\n- Positions 4-6 are all zeros \u2192 second element 3.\n- Third element could be 3 if there are no 5s? But here, there are none \u2192 third element 3. But in Example 0's first input, third element is 3 because there's a 5. So that doesn't make sense.\n\nThis is conflicting. Maybe I need to look for a different pattern.\n\nAnother approach: Looking at the outputs, each output list has three elements. The possible values are 0 and 3. Maybe each element in the output corresponds to a certain pair of elements in the input list, like adjacent elements. For example, the first output element could be comparing elements 0 and 1, the second comparing 1 and 2, etc. But seven elements would allow six pairs, but output is three elements.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output elements are determined by the positions of 7s and 5s. For example:\n\n- For each input list, look at the first three elements (before the 1) and the last three elements (after the 1). The three output elements could be:\n\n1. 3 if the first three elements are all 7s, else 0.\n2. 3 if the last three elements are all 5s, else 0.\n3. 3 if there's a mix of 7s and 5s, but that doesn't fit.\n\nWait, let's test this. Example 0's first input list:\n\nFirst three elements: 7,7,0 \u2192 not all 7s \u2192 first output 0.\nLast three:5,0,0 \u2192 not all 5s \u2192 second output 0.\nThird output element: maybe 3 if there's at least one 5 in the last three \u2192 yes, so third element 3. Which matches [0,0,3].\n\nExample 0's second input list: [7,0,0,1,5,0,0]\n\nFirst three:7,0,0 \u2192 not all 7s \u2192 0.\nLast three:5,0,0 \u2192 not all 5s \u2192 second element 0.\nThird element: presence of 5 \u2192 3. So output [0,0,3]. But according to Example 0's output for the second input list, the output is [0,3,3]. Hmm, this doesn't fit. So maybe the second element is not about all 5s.\n\nWait, looking at Example 0's second input list's output: [0,3,3]. According to this hypothesis, that would require the second element to be 3, implying the last three are all 5s. But the last three are 5,0,0 \u2192 not. So this hypothesis is incorrect.\n\nAlternative idea: Perhaps the output elements are based on the count of 7s in the first three positions and 5s in the last three. For example:\n\n- First output element: 3 if there are exactly two 7s in the first three.\n- Second: 3 if there are exactly one 5 in the last three.\n- Third: something else.\n\nBut this seems too arbitrary.\n\nLooking at Example 1's second input list:\n\nInput: [0,0,0,1,0,0,0]\nOutput: [3,3,3]\n\nFirst three all 0 \u2192 perhaps first element is 3 if there are no 7s.\nLast three all 0 \u2192 perhaps second element is 3 if there are no 5s.\nThird element: maybe 3 if there are no 7s or 5s in the entire list. Here, yes, so third element 3.\n\nSo the output for this list is [3,3,3], which fits.\n\nBut let's check other examples. Take Example 0's third input list: [0,0,0,1,5,0,5]. Output is [0,3,0].\n\nFirst three are zeros \u2192 first element 3? But output is 0. Hmm, that doesn't fit. So maybe that's not the pattern.\n\nAlternative approach: Let's look at the positions where 7s and 5s appear and see if they correlate with the output.\n\nFor each input list, split into parts before and after the 1 (position 3).\n\nFor Example 0's first input list:\n\nBefore 1: [7,7,0]\nAfter 1: [5,0,0]\n\nOutput: [0,0,3]\n\nPerhaps each output element corresponds to a comparison between the before and after parts. For example, the first output element is 3 if there's a 7 in the before part and a 5 in the after part, but this is too vague.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the first output element is 3 if the sum of the before part is divisible by 7, but 7+7+0=14 \u2192 14/7=2, so maybe 0. But output is 0, which fits. The third element: sum of after part is 5 \u2192 not divisible by 5. So not sure.\n\nAnother idea: Maybe the output is derived from the number of 7s and 5s in specific positions. For example:\n\n- The first output element is 3 if there's a 7 in the first position.\n- The second output element is 3 if there's a 5 in the fifth position.\n- The third output element is 3 if there's a 7 in the seventh position.\n\nBut this is just a guess. Let's test.\n\nExample 0's first input list:\n\nPositions 0:7 \u2192 first output element 3? But output is 0. So that doesn't fit.\n\nExample 1's second input list:\n\nAll positions except 3 are 0. So output is [3,3,3]. According to this hypothesis, none of the positions would have 7 or 5, so output would be all 0s, which contradicts. So not correct.\n\nAnother angle: The outputs might be related to the other input lists in the same example. Maybe each output list is generated by comparing the corresponding input list with the other three. For example, checking if certain positions are the same across all four input lists. But this seems complicated.\n\nAlternatively, each output list's three elements might represent the number of times a certain condition is met across the four input lists. But since each output list is part of a four-list output, perhaps each output list is based on the corresponding input list.\n\nWait, let's take Example 0's four output lists:\n\nOutput 0: [0,0,3]\nOutput 1: [0,3,3]\nOutput 2: [0,3,0]\nOutput 3: [0,0,3]\n\nLooking at the input lists for Example 0:\n\nList 0: [7,7,0,1,5,0,0]\nList 1: [7,0,0,1,5,0,0]\nList 2: [0,0,0,1,5,0,5]\nList 3: [0,0,0,1,5,5,0]\n\nMaybe for each input list, the output elements are determined by comparing it to the next list. Like, for List 0, compare with List 1, and generate an output based on differences. But each output list has three elements. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, the output for each list is generated by looking at the previous and next lists. But this might not work for the first and last lists.\n\nAlternatively, think of the four input lists as forming a 4x7 grid. The output is a 4x3 grid, where each row (output list) is derived from the corresponding input list. Maybe each of the three output elements corresponds to a pair of elements in the input list. For example, the first output element is the sum of the first and second elements modulo something. But I'm not seeing it.\n\nAlternatively, each output element is 3 if the corresponding input positions have a certain pattern. For example, the first output element corresponds to positions 0 and 6. If they are both 7, output 3. But in Example 0's first input list, position 0 is 7 and position 6 is 0 \u2192 output 0. That doesn't help.\n\nAnother thought: The numbers 7 and 5 might represent letters (like in a cipher), but that's a stretch. 7 could be 'T' and 5 'S', but I don't see how that would translate to 0 and 3.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is related to the indices where the numbers 7 and 5 appear. For example, the first output element is the number of times 7 appears in the first three positions multiplied by something. But again, not clear.\n\nLet me look for a pattern in the output elements across examples.\n\nFor example, in Example 0's outputs:\n\n[0,0,3], [0,3,3], [0,3,0], [0,0,3]\n\nThe third element of the first and fourth output lists is 3. Looking at their corresponding input lists' positions 4-6:\n\nFirst input list's positions 4-6:5,0,0 \u2192 third element of output is 3.\nFourth input list's positions 4-6:5,5,0 \u2192 third element of output is 3. So perhaps the third element is 3 if there's at least one 5 in positions 4-6. That fits. For the second input list in Example 0: positions 4-6:5,0,0 \u2192 third output element is 3. So that would fit. But the third input list's positions 4-6 are 5,0,5 \u2192 has 5s. The output for that list is [0,3,0]. So third element is 0, which contradicts. Hmm. That's a problem.\n\nWait, Example 0's third input list: [0,0,0,1,5,0,5]. The output is [0,3,0]. Positions 4-6:5,0,5. So two 5s. According to the hypothesis, the third output element should be 3. But it's 0. So that doesn't fit.\n\nMaybe the third element is 3 only if there's exactly one 5 in positions 4-6. In the third input list of Example 0, there are two 5s \u2192 output 0. So that could be. Let's check:\n\nFirst input list: one 5 \u2192 third element 3.\nSecond input list: one 5 \u2192 third element 3.\nThird input list: two 5s \u2192 third element 0.\nFourth input list: two 5s \u2192 third element 3. Wait, no. The fourth input list of Example 0 is [0,0,0,1,5,5,0]. Positions 4-6:5,5,0 \u2192 two 5s. Output is [0,0,3]. Third element is 3. So that contradicts. So this idea is invalid.\n\nAnother angle: Perhaps the output elements are related to the previous or next input lists. For example, the first output element of a list is 3 if the same position in the next list is a certain value. But this seems complicated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each output element is 3 if the corresponding input list's element at a certain position is the same across all four input lists. For example, first output element is 3 if all four input lists have the same value in position 0. Let's check Example 0:\n\nInput lists' position 0: 7,7,0,0 \u2192 not all same. So first output element for all lists would be 0. Which matches Example 0's outputs, which have first elements 0. But this doesn't explain other examples. For Example 1's second input list, the first element is 0. The other lists' position 0:7,0,7,0. So not all same. So output first element is 3, but according to this idea, it should be 0. Doesn't fit.\n\nAnother approach: Let's look at the differences between the input lists and the output lists. For example, in Example 0's first input list, the output is [0,0,3]. What's special about the input list?\n\nThe input list has 7s in the first two positions, a 0, then 1, followed by 5, 0, 0. The output is [0,0,3]. Maybe the output is encoding how many times a certain pattern occurs. For example, the third element being 3 might indicate that the fifth element (position 4) is a 5. But in the first input list, position 4 is 5. So why isn't the first element of the output 3 as well? Or maybe the first element is 3 if position 0 is 7, which it is, but the output is 0. So that's not.\n\nAlternatively, considering that 7 and 5 are primes. Maybe the output is based on prime numbers in certain positions. But the output is 0 and 3, which are not primes except for 3. Not sure.\n\nWait, 3 is the only output number used. Maybe each 3 represents a prime number's presence. But how?\n\nLet me try to summarize what I have so far:\n\nThe input lists are split into two parts by the 1 in position 3. The first three elements and the last three. The output has three elements. But it's unclear how they relate.\n\nAnother possible pattern is that each output list's elements correspond to the presence of 7s in the first three positions, 5s in the last three, and a combination of both. For example:\n\n- First element: 3 if there are any 7s in the first three positions.\n- Second element: 3 if there are any 5s in the last three positions.\n- Third element: 3 if there are both 7s in the first three and 5s in the last three.\n\nLet's test this with Example 0's first input list:\n\nFirst three have 7s \u2192 first element 3? But output is 0. So no.\n\nAlternatively, inverse:\n\n- First element: 3 if there are no 7s in the first three.\n- Second element: 3 if there are no 5s in the last three.\n- Third element: 3 if there are no 7s and no 5s.\n\nBut in Example 0's first input list, first three have 7s \u2192 first element 0. Last three have a 5 \u2192 second element 0. Third element 3: but why? Maybe third element is 3 if there are both 7s and 5s. So first three have 7s, last three have a 5 \u2192 third element 3. That fits.\n\nLet's test this hypothesis:\n\nExample 0's first input list:\n\nOutput [0,0,3]. \n\n- 0 (there are 7s in first three)\n- 0 (there are 5s in last three)\n- 3 (both are present).\n\nYes, this fits.\n\nExample 0's second input list: [7,0,0,1,5,0,0].\n\n- First three have a 7 \u2192 first element 0.\n- Last three have a 5 \u2192 second element 0.\n- Both present \u2192 third element 3. But output is [0,3,3]. So this hypothesis doesn't explain the second element being 3.\n\nHmm. Maybe the second element is something else. Let's adjust the hypothesis:\n\n- First element: 3 if no 7s in first three.\n- Second element: 3 if no 5s in last three.\n- Third element: 3 if both 7s and 5s are present.\n\nIn Example 0's first input list:\n\nFirst three have 7s \u2192 0.\nLast three have 5 \u2192 0.\nThird element: both \u2192 3. Output [0,0,3]. Correct.\n\nExample 0's second input list:\n\nFirst three have 7 \u2192 0.\nLast three have 5 \u2192 0.\nThird element: both \u21923. But output is [0,3,3]. So the second element is 3, which according to this hypothesis would require no 5s. But there is a 5. So this is conflicting.\n\nAnother adjustment: Maybe the second element is 3 if there are exactly two 5s in the last three. Or another count.\n\nAlternatively, the second element is 3 if all of the last three are 5s. Let's check:\n\nExample 0's fourth input list: [0,0,0,1,5,5,0]. Last three are 5,5,0 \u2192 not all 5s. Output is [0,0,3]. So the second element would be 0, which matches. \n\nExample 1's second input list: [0,0,0,1,0,0,0]. Last three are 0s \u2192 second element 3. Output [3,3,3]. So yes. \n\nExample 0's third input list: [0,0,0,1,5,0,5]. Last three have 5,0,5 \u2192 not all 5s \u2192 second element 0. Output is [0,3,0]. Hmm, but the second element is 3. This contradicts.\n\nThis is getting too complicated. Let's try a different approach. Maybe the output is generated by comparing the current list to the previous list in the sequence. For example, each output list is based on the changes from the previous input list. But since the output lists are four in number, and the input lists are four, how does that work?\n\nAlternatively, each output element corresponds to a comparison between two consecutive elements in the input list. For example:\n\nFor each input list, compare elements in pairs (like 0-1, 1-2, 2-3) but there are six pairs. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the three output elements could be based on the number of times 7 appears in the first three positions, the number of times 5 appears in the last three, and the total sum. But how to convert to 0 and 3.\n\nAlternatively, the output elements are binary flags represented as 0 and 3 (like 0 for false and 3 for true). For example:\n\n- First element: true (3) if the first three elements contain exactly two 7s.\n- Second element: true if the last three elements contain exactly one 5.\n- Third element: true if there's a 5 in position 4.\n\nBut this requires specific counts.\n\nLooking at Example 0's first input list:\n\nFirst three elements: two 7s \u2192 first element 3.\nLast three: one 5 \u2192 second element 3.\nPosition 4: 5 \u2192 third element 3. So output would be [3,3,3], but the actual output is [0,0,3]. Doesn't fit.\n\nAnother idea: Maybe each output element corresponds to the presence of a 7 followed by a 5 in specific positions. For example:\n\n- First output element: 3 if there's a 7 in position 0 and a 5 in position 4.\n- Second: 7 in position 1 and 5 in position 5.\n- Third: 7 in position 2 and 5 in position 6.\n\nIn Example 0's first input list:\n\nPosition 0:7, position4:5 \u2192 first element 3. But output is 0. So no.\n\nAlternatively, the output is 3 if a 7 and 5 are present in certain paired positions.\n\nAlternatively, for each output element, check if the corresponding pair (like positions 0 and 4) has a 7 and 5. For example:\n\nOutput element 0: 3 if input[0] is 7 and input[4] is 5.\nOutput element 1: 3 if input[1] is 7 and input[5] is 5.\nOutput element 2: 3 if input[2] is 7 and input[6] is 5.\n\nLet's test this:\n\nExample 0's first input list: [7,7,0,1,5,0,0]\n\nOutput elements:\n\n0:7 at 0 and 5 at4 \u2192 yes \u21923. But output is 0. Doesn't fit.\n\nExample 1's second input list: [0,0,0,1,0,0,0]. All pairs would be 0 and 0 \u2192 output [3,3,3]. But according to this hypothesis, all are 0. So this doesn't fit.\n\nThis approach isn't working.\n\nLet me look for a pattern in the outputs. For example, in Example 0's outputs:\n\n[0,0,3]\n[0,3,3]\n[0,3,0]\n[0,0,3]\n\nNotice that the third element is 3 in three of the four cases. \n\nIn Example 1's outputs:\n\n[0,0,3]\n[3,3,3]\n[0,0,3]\n[0,0,0]\n\nThe third element is 3 in the first and third outputs.\n\nMaybe the third element is 3 when there's a 5 in position 6. Let's check:\n\nExample 0's first input list: position6 is 0 \u2192 third output element is 3. No.\n\nAlternatively, the third element is 3 when there's a 5 in position 5. Example 0's first input list: position5 is 0 \u2192 third element is 3. No.\n\nAnother angle: Looking at the Test Input:\n\n[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 5, 0]\n[7, 7, 7, 1, 5, 5, 0]\n[0, 0, 0, 1, 5, 0, 0]\n[7, 0, 0, 1, 5, 5, 5]\n\nAssuming the pattern is:\n\nEach output list's three elements are determined by:\n\n1. 3 if all first three elements are zeros.\n2. 3 if all last three elements are zeros.\n3. 3 if there's a 5 in position 4.\n\nLet's apply this to the first test input list: [0,0,0,1,0,5,0].\n\nFirst three are zeros \u2192 first element 3.\nLast three:0,5,0 \u2192 not all zeros \u2192 second element 0.\nPosition4 is 0 \u2192 third element 0. So output would be [3,0,0].\n\nSecond test input list: [7,7,7,1,5,5,0]. First three are 7s \u2192 first element 0. Last three:5,5,0 \u2192 not zeros \u2192 second element 0. Position4 is 5 \u2192 third element 3. So output [0,0,3].\n\nThird test input list: [0,0,0,1,5,0,0]. First three zeros \u21923. Last three:5,0,0 \u2192 not zeros \u21920. Position4 is5 \u21923. Output [3,0,3].\n\nFourth test input list: [7,0,0,1,5,5,5]. First three:7,0,0 \u2192 not all zeros \u21920. Last three:5,5,5 \u2192 all 5s, not zeros \u21920. Position4 is5 \u21923. Output [0,0,3].\n\nBut I need to check if this aligns with the training examples. Let's take Example 0's third input list: [0,0,0,1,5,0,5]. First three are zeros \u2192 first element 3. Last three:5,0,5 \u2192 not zeros \u2192 second element 0. Position4 is5 \u2192 third element3. Output should be [3,0,3]. But the actual output is [0,3,0]. So this contradicts.\n\nHmm. This approach isn't correct. Let's think of other possibilities.\n\nAnother observation: In all input lists, the fourth element is 1. So maybe the 1 acts as a separator. The first three elements are one part, the last three another. The output could be based on comparing these two parts.\n\nMaybe the output elements are:\n\n1. 3 if the first three elements are all 0s.\n2. 3 if the last three elements are all 0s.\n3. 3 if the first three elements have at least one 7 and the last three have at least one 5.\n\nLet's test this with Example 0's first input list:\n\nFirst three:7,7,0 \u2192 not all 0 \u21920. Last three:5,0,0 \u2192 not all 0 \u21920. But third element: first part has 7s, last part has 5 \u21923. Output [0,0,3]. Correct.\n\nExample 0's second input list: [7,0,0,1,5,0,0]. First three not all 0 \u21920. Last three not all 0 \u21920. Third element: first part has 7, last part has5 \u21923. Output should be [0,0,3], but actual output is [0,3,3]. So this doesn't explain the second element being 3.\n\nExample 0's third input list: [0,0,0,1,5,0,5]. First three all 0 \u21923. Last three not all 0 \u21920. Third element: first part has no 7 \u2192 no, so third element 0. Output should be [3,0,0], but actual output is [0,3,0]. Contradicts.\n\nThis isn't working.\n\nAnother angle: The output lists seem to have three elements, perhaps each element corresponds to a specific position in the input list after the 1. For example:\n\nOutput element 0: position 4\nOutput element 1: position 5\nOutput element 2: position 6\n\nAnd 3 is assigned if the value is 5, 0 otherwise.\n\nLet's test:\n\nExample 0's first input list: positions4-6 are5,0,0 \u2192 output [5\u21923,0\u21920,0\u21920]. But the output is [0,0,3]. Doesn't fit.\n\nExample 1's second input list: positions4-6 are0,0,0 \u2192 all 0s \u2192 output [0,0,0], but the actual output is [3,3,3]. So no.\n\nAlternative idea: Maybe the output elements are 3 if the corresponding position after the 1 (positions4-6) is a 5. For example:\n\nOutput[0] is 3 if position4 is5.\nOutput[1] is3 if position5 is5.\nOutput[2] is3 if position6 is5.\n\nIn Example 0's first input list:\n\nposition4 is5 \u2192 output0:3. position5:0 \u2192 output1:0. position6:0 \u2192 output2:0. So output [3,0,0], but actual output is [0,0,3]. Doesn't fit.\n\nExample 0's third input list: position4:5,5:0,6:5 \u2192 output [3,0,3]. But actual output is [0,3,0]. Not matching.\n\nAnother possibility: The output elements are the count of 5s in positions4-6, multiplied by 3 divided by the count. For example, if there's one 5, output3. Two 5s, output0. Three 5s, output0. Doesn't make sense.\n\nLet me think of the outputs as 3 indicating a certain condition met. For example:\n\n- For each of the three output elements, they are 3 if a certain rule is met for the corresponding triplet of elements in the input list.\n\nWait, each input list has seven elements. How to split into three triplets? Maybe overlapping:\n\nTriplet1: elements0-2\nTriplet2: elements2-4\nTriplet3: elements4-6\n\nEach triplet corresponds to an output element. Then, for each triplet, output3 if all elements in the triplet are the same. Otherwise 0.\n\nExample 0's first input list:\n\nTriplet1:7,7,0 \u2192 not all same \u21920.\nTriplet2:0,1,5 \u2192 not same \u21920.\nTriplet3:5,0,0 \u2192 not same \u21920. So output should be [0,0,0], but actual is [0,0,3]. Doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, output3 if the triplet contains a 5 or 7. Triplet3 has 5 \u21923. So output would be [0,0,3]. That fits Example 0's first output. Let's test this:\n\nExample 0's first input list:\n\nTriplet1:7,7,0 \u2192 has 7 \u21923. But output is 0. So no.\n\nAnother idea: Maybe each output element is 3 if the corresponding triplet has exactly one 5 or 7.\n\nExample 0's first input list's triplet3 has one 5 \u21923. Output is [0,0,3]. But triplet1 has two 7s \u21920. Triplet2 has one 5 \u21920. So this doesn't fit.\n\nThis is getting frustrating. Let's try to look for a pattern that fits all examples.\n\nLooking at Example 1's second input list:\n\nInput: [0,0,0,1,0,0,0]\nOutput: [3,3,3]\n\nAll elements except the 1 are 0. So maybe when all elements before and after are 0, the output is all 3s.\n\nExample 0's third input list:\n\nInput: [0,0,0,1,5,0,5]\nOutput: [0,3,0]\n\nBut here, the first three are zeros, so according to that, first output element should be3, but it's 0. Contradicts.\n\nAnother possibility: The output elements are 3 if the corresponding input list's elements match a certain pattern across all four input lists. For example, the first output element is 3 if all four input lists have a 0 in position0. But in Example 0's input lists, position0 varies between 7 and 0, so this isn't the case.\n\nAlternatively, the output elements are based on the majority value in the corresponding position across all four input lists. But the output is per input list, not per position.\n\nLet me try to look for a different approach. Maybe the output lists are related to the previous input list in some way, such as the difference between consecutive lists.\n\nFor Example 0's input lists:\n\nList0: [7,7,0,1,5,0,0]\nList1: [7,0,0,1,5,0,0]\nList2: [0,0,0,1,5,0,5]\nList3: [0,0,0,1,5,5,0]\n\nThe output lists are four. Let's compare List0 and List1. The differences are at positions1 and2 (7\u21920 and0\u21920). How does that relate to the first output list [0,0,3]?\n\nNot obvious. \n\nAlternatively, the output lists are generated by counting the number of times each element appears in the same position across all input lists. For example, if in position0, two input lists have 7 and two have 0, the output element0 would be 3 for the lists with 7 and 0. But this doesn't fit.\n\nAnother observation: In all training examples, the fourth element of every input list is 1. This is a constant. So maybe the transformation involves the elements before and after this 1.\n\nLet me try this: For each input list, the output is determined by the elements before the 1 (positions0-2) and after (positions4-6). Each output element corresponds to a comparison between these two regions.\n\nFor example:\n\n- Output element0: 3 if the number of 7s in positions0-2 equals the number of 5s in positions4-6.\n- Output element1: 3 if there are no 7s or 5s in positions0-2 and 4-6.\n- Output element2: Some other condition.\n\nBut this is too vague. Let's check Example 0's first input list:\n\nPositions0-2:7,7,0 (two 7s)\nPositions4-6:5,0,0 (one 5)\nSo 2 vs 1 \u2192 not equal. Output element0 is0. Correct.\n\nExample 1's second input list:\n\nPositions0-2:0,0,0 (no 7s)\nPositions4-6:0,0,0 (no 5s)\nSo output element0 would be3 if the counts are equal (0 vs0 \u2192 yes). But the output is [3,3,3]. So perhaps output element0 is3 if both regions have no 7s and 5s.\n\nThis fits. \n\nExample 0's third input list:\n\nPositions0-2:0,0,0 (no 7s)\nPositions4-6:5,0,5 (two 5s)\nSo output element0 is3 if both regions have no 7s and 5s. But the second region has 5s, so no. Output is [0,3,0]. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAnother angle: The output elements are 3 if certain conditions are met in both the before and after regions. For example:\n\n- Output element0: 3 if before has 7s and after has 5s.\n- Output element1: 3 if before has no 7s and after has no 5s.\n- Output element2: 3 if before has no 7s and after has 5s.\n\nTesting this:\n\nExample 0's first input list:\n\nBefore has 7s, after has 5s \u2192 output0:3. But actual output is0. So no.\n\nExample 1's second input list:\n\nBefore has no 7s, after has no 5s \u2192 output1:3. Output is [3,3,3]. So all three elements are3. This doesn't fit.\n\nI'm stuck. Let's try to look for a pattern in the outputs based on the test input.\n\nThe test input is:\n\n[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 5, 0]\n[7, 7, 7, 1, 5, 5, 0]\n[0, 0, 0, 1, 5, 0, 0]\n[7, 0, 0, 1, 5, 5, 5]\n\nAssuming the pattern involves the presence of 7s before the 1 and 5s after, let's try to generate possible outputs.\n\nFor the first test input list:\n\nBefore: all zeros \u2192 maybe first output element is3.\nAfter: 0,5,0 \u2192 has a 5 in position5. So third output element is3 if there's a 5. So output could be [3,0,3].\n\nBut looking at the training examples, when a list has all zeros before the 1 and a 5 in the after, the output varies. For example, Example 0's third input list has zeros before and 5s after, output is [0,3,0]. So this approach is inconsistent.\n\nAlternatively, if the first output element is3 when there are no 7s before, the second when there are no 5s after, and the third when there's a 5 in the after.\n\nFirst test input list:\n\nNo 7s before \u21923.\nAfter has a 5 \u2192 third element3.\nSecond element: after has a 5 \u21920.\n\nSo output [3,0,3]. But looking at similar training examples, like Example 0's third input list, which has zeros before and two 5s after, the output is [0,3,0]. So not matching.\n\nPerhaps the output is generated by XOR of certain conditions. For example:\n\nFirst element:3 if before has 7s XOR after has 5s.\nBut this is just a guess.\n\nAnother possibility: Each output element corresponds to a different rule. For example:\n\n- Element0:3 if before has no 7s.\n- Element1:3 if after has no 5s.\n- Element2:3 if before has 7s and after has 5s.\n\nTesting this:\n\nExample 0's first input list:\n\nBefore has 7s \u21920.\nAfter has 5 \u21920.\nElement2: yes \u21923. Output [0,0,3]. Correct.\n\nExample 0's second input list:\n\nBefore has a 7 \u21920.\nAfter has a5 \u21920.\nElement2: yes \u21923. Output is [0,3,3]. Hmm, element1 is3, which would require after has no 5s. But after has a5. So this contradicts.\n\nExample 1's second input list:\n\nBefore has no 7s \u21923.\nAfter has no5s \u21923.\nElement2: no \u21920. Output is [3,3,3]. So element2 is3, which contradicts.\n\nThis isn't working. I'm running out of ideas. Perhaps I should look for the pattern in the training examples and try to find a common rule.\n\nLooking at Example 0's outputs:\n\nThe outputs are four lists, each with three elements. The first three input lists have outputs that start with 0, except the third output list which starts with 0. The third element is often 3 when there's a 5 in the after part.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each output element corresponds to a specific comparison between the elements of the input lists. For example, each output list is the result of comparing the current input list to the next one, but this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, think of the four input lists as a group and look for a pattern across all four. For example, each output list's elements are the number of times a certain position has a non-zero value across all four input lists. But the output elements are 0 and 3, which could correspond to counts of 3. But in Example 0's first input list, position0 is7 in two of the four lists. Not sure.\n\nAnother possible pattern: The output elements are 3 for each position where the corresponding element in the input list is the same across all four input lists. For example, position3 is always 1, so perhaps one of the output elements is3. But in the outputs, there's no element that is always3. So this isn't the case.\n\nAt this point, I think the pattern might involve the presence of 7s in the first three positions and 5s in the last three positions, with the output elements indicating certain combinations. But without a clear pattern, it's challenging.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and lack of progress, I'll try to make an educated guess based on some observations:\n\n- The third element of the output often corresponds to the presence of a 5 in the last three positions.\n- The first element of the output is often 3 when the first three elements are all zeros.\n- The second element might be 3 when certain conditions are met in the middle positions.\n\nApplying this to the test input:\n\nTest Input:\n\nList1: [0,0,0,1,0,5,0] \u2192 first three zeros \u2192 first element3. Last three:0,5,0 \u2192 third element3. So output [3, something,3]. But need to check the second element.\n\nList2: [7,7,7,1,5,5,0] \u2192 first three all 7s \u2192 first element0. Last three have 5s \u2192 third element3. So output [0, something,3].\n\nList3: [0,0,0,1,5,0,0] \u2192 first three zeros \u21923. Last three have5 \u2192 third element3. Output [3, something,3].\n\nList4: [7,0,0,1,5,5,5] \u2192 first three have a7 \u21920. Last three all5s \u2192 third element3. Output [0, something,3].\n\nBut what about the second element? It's possible that the second element is3 when there are no 7s or 5s in the entire list. But for List1 in the test input, after the 1, there's a5, so second element0. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the second element is3 if the middle element (position3) is 1 and something else. But position3 is always1.\n\nGiven the lack of clarity, I'll proceed with the following pattern based on the hypothesis that:\n\n- First output element:3 if the first three elements are all zeros.\n- Second output element:3 if the middle elements (positions 2-4) are all zeros.\n- Third output element:3 if there's a5 in the last three positions.\n\nBut this is just a guess. Testing this:\n\nFor Test Input:\n\nList1: [0,0,0,1,0,5,0]\n\nFirst three zeros \u21923.\n\nMiddle elements (positions2-4):0,1,0 \u2192 not all zeros \u21920.\n\nLast three have5 \u21923.\n\nOutput: [3,0,3].\n\nList2: [7,7,7,1,5,5,0]\n\nFirst three not zeros \u21920.\n\nMiddle elements:7,1,5 \u2192 not zeros \u21920.\n\nLast three have5 \u21923.\n\nOutput: [0,0,3].\n\nList3: [0,0,0,1,5,0,0]\n\nFirst three zeros \u21923.\n\nMiddle elements:0,1,5 \u2192 not zeros \u21920.\n\nLast three have5 \u21923.\n\nOutput: [3,0,3].\n\nList4: [7,0,0,1,5,5,5]\n\nFirst three not zeros \u21920.\n\nMiddle elements:0,1,5 \u2192 not zeros \u21920.\n\nLast three have5 \u21923.\n\nOutput: [0,0,3].\n\nBut looking at the training examples, this doesn't fully align. For instance, Example 0's third input list:\n\n[0,0,0,1,5,0,5] \u2192 first three zeros \u21923.\n\nMiddle elements:0,1,5 \u21920.\n\nLast three have5 \u21923. Output should be [3,0,3], but actual output is [0,3,0]. So this contradicts.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and the need to provide an answer, I'll proceed with the best guess based on parts of the hypothesis, even if it's not perfect. Perhaps the third element is 3 if there's exactly one5 in the last three positions. For the Test Input, let's proceed with that.\n\nTest Input processing:\n\nList1: [0,0,0,1,0,5,0] \u2192 last three:0,5,0 \u2192 one5 \u2192 third element3. First three zeros \u21923. Second element: ?\n\nList2: [7,7,7,1,5,5,0] \u2192 last three:5,5,0 \u2192 two5s \u2192 third element0. First three not zeros \u21920. Second element: ?\n\nList3: [0,0,0,1,5,0,0] \u2192 last three:5,0,0 \u2192 one5 \u21923. First three zeros \u21923. Second element: ?\n\nList4: [7,0,0,1,5,5,5] \u2192 last three:5,5,5 \u2192 three5s \u2192 third element0. First three not zeros \u21920. Second element: ?\n\nBut this doesn't align with training examples. For example, Example 0's first list has one5 in last three \u2192 third element3. Which matches.\n\nExample 0's third input list has two5s in last three \u2192 third element0. Which matches. But in Example 0's fourth input list, last three are5,5,0 \u2192 two5s \u2192 third element0. Output is [0,0,3]. Contradicts.\n\nThis indicates that the pattern might not be the count of5s, but something else.\n\nFinal desperate guess: The output elements are [a, b, c], where:\n\n- a is3 if the first three elements are all zeros.\n- b is3 if the fifth element is 5.\n- c is3 if the sixth element is5.\n\nTest Input:\n\nList1: first three zeros \u2192a=3. fifth element5 \u2192b=3. sixth0 \u2192c=0. Output [3,3,0].\n\nList2: first three not zeros \u2192a=0. fifth5 \u2192b=3. sixth0 \u2192c=0. Output [0,3,0].\n\nList3: first three zeros \u2192a=3. fifth0 \u2192b=0. sixth0 \u2192c=0. Output [3,0,0].\n\nList4: first three not zeros \u2192a=0. fifth5 \u2192b=3. sixth5 \u2192c=3. Output [0,3,3].\n\nBut looking at the training examples:\n\nExample 0's first input list: fifth element0 \u2192b=0. Output [0,0,3]. c is3 \u2192 sixth element0. Doesn't fit.\n\nExample 1's second input list: fifth element0 \u2192b=0. Output [3,3,3]. So this hypothesis is incorrect.\n\nI'm clearly not getting it. Given the time constraints, I'll proceed with the following output based on the initial hypothesis that:\n\n- Each output element corresponds to the presence of a 5 in the last three positions, with the third element being3 if there's at least one5, and the first element being3 if the first three are zeros. Second element is3 if the fifth position is5.\n\nTest Input:\n\nFirst list: first three zeros \u21923. fifth is5 \u21923. sixth0 \u21920. Output [3,3,0].\n\nSecond list: first three not zeros \u21920. fifth5 \u21923. sixth0 \u21920. Output [0,3,0].\n\nThird list: first three zeros \u21923. fifth0 \u21920. sixth0 \u21920. Output [3,0,0].\n\nFourth list: first three not zeros \u21920. fifth5 \u21923. sixth5 \u21923. Output [0,3,3].\n\nBut looking at Example 0's first list's output [0,0,3], this would require fifth element5 \u2192b=3. But output has0. So this is wrong.\n\nAt this point, I'm stuck and need to make a best-guess answer based on possible patterns."
