        "cot_1": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. So, the task is to look at the input lists and determine how they transform into the output lists. Let's go through each training example step by step.\n\nStarting with Example 0. The input is a 5x5 grid. The output has two lists: [1,1] and [2,1]. Hmm. Let me look at the input rows. Maybe the outputs are derived from certain columns or specific positions. Let me check the columns.\n\nLooking at the first input row: [2,1,2,1,2]. The next row is all 1s. Then the third row is same as the first. The fourth starts with 0s. The fifth is similar to first but starts with 0s. The output is two lists. Maybe the output is taking elements from the end of each row? Let's see.\n\nWait, the output lists are shorter than the input rows. For example 0, the output has two elements each. Let's check the input rows. The first input row has 5 elements. The output rows have 2. Maybe they are taking the last two elements of some rows? Let's check the first example's input and output.\n\nIn Example 0, the input has 5 rows. The output has two rows. Let's see the input rows:\n\nRow 0: [2,1,2,1,2] \u2192 maybe output row 0 is [1,1]. Where does 1 and 1 come from? Let's see the elements. The last two elements of row 0 are 1 and 2. But output is [1,1]. Hmm, maybe not. Alternatively, maybe looking at the middle elements. Row 0's middle three elements are 1,2,1. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is derived from the differences between rows. For instance, comparing adjacent rows. Let's take the first two rows of Example 0:\n\nRow0: [2,1,2,1,2]\n\nRow1: [1,1,1,1,1]\n\nIf we subtract them, maybe? But 2-1=1, 1-1=0, etc. Not sure. The output's first list is [1,1]. Maybe the sum of certain elements? Not obvious.\n\nLooking at Example 1: Input is 4 rows of 4 elements each. Output is [8]. How does that happen? Let's look. The rows are:\n\n[8,6,0,6]\n\n[6,8,6,8]\n\n[8,6,8,6]\n\n[6,8,6,8]\n\nThe output is [8]. Maybe taking the first element of the first row? But 8 is the first element here. But why only one element? Or perhaps the output is the elements that are the same in all rows. Let's check. The first element in each row is 8,6,8,6. So no. The second elements: 6,8,6,8. Also alternating. The third elements: 0,6,8,6. Not the same. Fourth elements: 6,8,6,8. Again alternating. So maybe not that.\n\nWait, the output is [8], so perhaps the element that appears most frequently in a certain position. Let's check. The first position has 8,6,8,6 \u2192 8 appears twice. Second position: 6,8,6,8 \u2192 6 and 8 each twice. Third: 0,6,8,6 \u2192 6 appears three times. Fourth: 6,8,6,8 \u2192 same as second. So maybe not frequency.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the elements that are in the same position across all rows, but that's only possible if all are same. But in Example1, none of the columns have all same elements. So that's not it.\n\nLooking at Example2: Input is 7 rows. Output is two lists: [5,5] and [5,2]. Let's see the input. The first two rows are [2,2,5,2,2,5,2], then a row of all 5s. Then again the same as first two. Then the fifth row is [5,5,5,5,5,0,0], sixth row [2,2,5,2,2,0,0], seventh [2,2,5,2,2,0,0]. The output is two rows. Let me see. The output rows could be the last two elements of some rows. For example, the fifth row ends with 0,0. But the output is [5,5] and [5,2]. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps looking for the first occurrence of a certain pattern. Maybe the output is the middle elements of some rows. Let's check. The first row in Example2's input has a 5 in the third position. The third row is all 5s. Then the fifth row is all 5s except last two. The output is [5,5] and [5,2]. Wait, maybe the output is taking the third and fourth elements of the last two rows. Let's see. The last two input rows in Example2 are:\n\n[5,5,5,5,5,0,0]\n\n[2,2,5,2,2,0,0]\n\n[2,2,5,2,2,0,0]\n\nWait, but the output is two rows. The output [5,5] could be from the fifth row's third and fourth elements (5 and 5), and [5,2] from the sixth row's third and fourth elements (5 and 2). But the sixth row's third is 5, fourth is 2. So that would match. So maybe the output is taking certain positions from specific rows.\n\nBut why those rows? Let's see. The fifth row in Example2's input is [5,5,5,5,5,0,0]. The third element is 5, fourth is 5. The sixth row is [2,2,5,2,2,0,0], third is 5, fourth is 2. So if the output is taking elements from the third and fourth positions of the fifth and sixth rows, then yes. But why those rows?\n\nLooking back to the training examples, perhaps the output rows are the third and fourth elements of the middle rows or something like that. Alternatively, maybe the output is formed by the elements that are surrounded by certain values. Or perhaps it's related to the symmetry.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the elements where the rows change from a certain pattern. For example, in Example0, the first three rows have a pattern, then the fourth row starts with zeros. The output could be the elements where the transition happens. But not sure.\n\nAnother approach: look for the output elements in the input and see their positions. Let's take Example0's output: [1,1] and [2,1]. Where are these in the input? The first output row [1,1] could be from the second row, which is all 1s, but taking elements 1 and 2? Not sure. The second output row [2,1] is the last two elements of the first row. Wait, first row is [2,1,2,1,2], last two are 1,2. But the output is [2,1]. Hmm, perhaps reversed? Not sure.\n\nWait, maybe the output is the first two elements of the first two rows. For Example0, first two rows start with 2,1 and 1,1. But the output is [1,1] and [2,1]. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the elements that are the same in the same position across all rows. But in Example0, looking for columns where all elements are the same. For example, the first column: 2,1,2,0,0. Not same. Second column: 1,1,1,0,0. Third: 2,1,2,1,2. No. Fourth:1,1,1,1,1. Oh, the fourth column in the input of Example0 is all 1s except the fourth row. Wait, the fourth row's fourth element is 1. Let me check:\n\nInput rows for Example0:\n\nRow0: [2,1,2,1,2]\n\nRow1: [1,1,1,1,1]\n\nRow2: [2,1,2,1,2]\n\nRow3: [0,0,1,1,1]\n\nRow4: [0,0,2,1,2]\n\nLooking at column 3 (index 3?), since in programming it's 0-based. So column 3 for each row:\n\nRow0: 1\n\nRow1:1\n\nRow2:1\n\nRow3:1\n\nRow4:1. So yes, all 1s. So column 3 is all 1. Then column 4: 2,1,2,1,2. So that alternates. But the output for Example0 is [1,1] and [2,1]. So maybe the output is the columns that are all the same. But column 3 is all 1. So the output would be a column of [1,1,1,1,1], but the output is two rows. Hmm, that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the unique elements from certain positions. Let me think differently.\n\nLooking at Example1's output [8], which is a single element. The input has four rows. Maybe the output is the element that appears in the same position in every other row. Let's check. The first row starts with 8, second with 6, third with 8, fourth with 6. So alternating. So no element in the same position across all rows. So maybe not.\n\nWait, maybe the output is the elements that are present in all rows but not necessarily in the same position. For Example1, 8 is present in all rows. Let's see. Row0 has 8. Row1 has 6 and 8. Row2 has 8 and 6. Row3 has 6 and 8. So 8 is present in every row, and 6 is as well. So why output [8]? Maybe 8 is the maximum element? The output is [8], which is the maximum in the input. But in Example0's output, the elements are 1 and 2, which are present but not sure if they're maxima. So maybe that's not the pattern.\n\nAlternative approach: Perhaps the output is generated by looking for the positions where a certain condition is met across the rows. For example, if the element is the same in all rows for a particular column, then include it. But in Example0, the fourth column is all 1s. So the output would have a column [1,1,1,1,1], but the output is [1,1] and [2,1]. So that's not matching.\n\nWait, maybe the output is related to the rows that have a certain length of consecutive elements. For instance, in Example0's output, the first output row is [1,1], which could be from the second row [1,1,1,1,1], taking two 1s. The second output row [2,1] could be from the first row's fourth and fifth elements, which are 1 and 2. But reversed.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is formed by the last two elements of the last two rows. In Example0, the last two rows are [0,0,1,1,1] and [0,0,2,1,2]. The last two elements are [1,1] and [1,2]. But the output is [1,1] and [2,1]. Hmm, not matching. Unless it's taking the third and fourth elements. The third element of the last two rows would be 1 and 2, fourth elements 1 and 1. So [1,1] and [2,1]. Oh! That matches the output of Example0. Let's check:\n\nExample0's last two rows are:\n\n[0,0,1,1,1]\n\n[0,0,2,1,2]\n\nThird elements (index 2) are 1 and 2. Fourth elements (index 3) are 1 and 1. So combining these two pairs gives [1,1] and [2,1], which is exactly the output. So for Example0, the output is the third and fourth elements of the last two rows.\n\nLet me check this pattern with Example1. Example1's input has four rows. The last two rows are:\n\n[8,6,8,6]\n\n[6,8,6,8]\n\nTaking the third and fourth elements (index 2 and 3) of these two rows:\n\nFor third row (index 2): 8 and 6.\n\nFourth row: 6 and 8.\n\nSo combining these would give [8,6] and [6,8]. But the output of Example1 is [8]. Hmm, that doesn't fit. So perhaps this pattern isn't consistent.\n\nWait, maybe the output is taking the third and fourth elements of the middle rows. Let's see. For Example0, there are 5 rows. The middle row is row2: [2,1,2,1,2]. Third and fourth elements are 1 and 2. But the output is [1,1] and [2,1]. So maybe not.\n\nAlternative approach: Let's re-examine Example1. The output is [8]. Maybe the output is the element that appears in the same position in all but the last row. Let's check. The input rows for Example1 are:\n\nRow0: [8,6,0,6]\n\nRow1: [6,8,6,8]\n\nRow2: [8,6,8,6]\n\nRow3: [6,8,6,8]\n\nLooking for a position where all but the last row have the same element. Let's check each column:\n\nColumn 0: 8,6,8,6 \u2192 alternates. No.\n\nColumn1:6,8,6,8 \u2192 alternates.\n\nColumn2:0,6,8,6 \u2192 0 in first row, then 6,8,6.\n\nColumn3:6,8,6,8 \u2192 alternates.\n\nSo no column has the same element in all but the last row.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the element that is in the majority in a particular position. For Example1, let's see each column:\n\nColumn0: 8,6,8,6 \u2192 two 8s and two 6s. No majority.\n\nColumn1:6,8,6,8 \u2192 same.\n\nColumn2:0,6,8,6 \u2192 0, 6,8,6 \u2192 6 appears twice, 8 once, 0 once. So majority is 6.\n\nColumn3:6,8,6,8 \u2192 same as others.\n\nSo majority elements would be 6 for column2 and 6/8 in others, but output is 8. So that doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. Let's try Example2. The output is [5,5] and [5,2]. Let's check if these are the third and fourth elements of the fifth and sixth rows. The fifth row is [5,5,5,5,5,0,0], third and fourth are 5,5. Sixth row is [2,2,5,2,2,0,0], third and fourth are 5,2. So that's exactly the output. So in Example2, the output is the third and fourth elements of the fifth and sixth rows. But why those rows? How to determine which rows to pick.\n\nLooking at the input for Example2, there are 7 rows. The fifth and sixth rows (assuming 0-based) would be indices 4 and 5. Wait, the input for Example2 is:\n\nRow0: [2,2,5,2,2,5,2]\n\nRow1: same as row0\n\nRow2: all 5s\n\nRow3: same as row0\n\nRow4: same as row0\n\nRow5: [5,5,5,5,5,0,0]\n\nRow6: [2,2,5,2,2,0,0]\n\nWait, the fifth row (index5) is [5,5,5,5,5,0,0], and the sixth row (index6) is [2,2,5,2,2,0,0]. The output is two rows: [5,5] and [5,2]. So those are the third and fourth elements of these two rows.\n\nSo maybe the pattern is: take the third and fourth elements of the penultimate and last rows of the input.\n\nWait, in Example0, the last two rows are row3 and row4. Their third and fourth elements:\n\nRow3: [0,0,1,1,1] \u2192 third element is 1, fourth is 1.\n\nRow4: [0,0,2,1,2] \u2192 third element is 2, fourth is 1.\n\nSo output would be [1,1] and [2,1], which matches the output. So that's consistent.\n\nIn Example1, the last two rows are row2 and row3. Let's check their third and fourth elements.\n\nRow2: [8,6,8,6] \u2192 third element (index2) is 8, fourth (index3) is 6.\n\nRow3: [6,8,6,8] \u2192 third element is 6, fourth is 8.\n\nSo combining these would give [8,6] and [6,8]. But the output is [8]. So this doesn't fit. Hmm, so the pattern works for Example0 and Example2 but not Example1.\n\nWait, maybe there's a different rule. Let's look again. Example1's output is [8]. The input has four rows. What if the output is formed by taking the third element of the middle rows?\n\nBut Example1 has four rows. Middle rows are row1 and row2. Their third elements (index2) are 6 and 8. So combining those would give [6,8], which is not the output. So that's not it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is the elements that are in the same position in the first and last rows. For Example1, first row is [8,6,0,6], last row is [6,8,6,8]. Positions where elements are same:\n\nLooking at each index:\n\nIndex0: 8 vs 6 \u2192 no.\n\nIndex1:6 vs8\u2192no.\n\nIndex2:0 vs6\u2192no.\n\nIndex3:6 vs8\u2192no.\n\nNo matches. So output is empty, which contradicts the example.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the element(s) that are unique in their row. For Example1, looking for elements that appear once in each row. But not sure.\n\nWait, maybe the output is the maximum element from each row, concatenated. For Example0:\n\nRow0: max is 2, row1:1, row2:2, row3:1, row4:2. But output is [1,1] and [2,1]. So that's not matching.\n\nHmm, this is tricky. Let's try to find another angle. Let's look at the output sizes. For Example0, the output has two rows, each of length 2. The input has 5 rows. So maybe the output is two rows, each corresponding to two rows of the input. Perhaps combining certain elements from two consecutive rows.\n\nWait, let's think about the positions of the elements in the output. For Example0's output [1,1] and [2,1], the elements are from the third and fourth positions of the last two rows.\n\nExample2's output is [5,5] and [5,2], which are the third and fourth elements of the fifth and sixth rows.\n\nExample1's input has four rows, last two rows are rows 2 and3. Their third and fourth elements are 8,6 and 6,8. So the output would be [8,6] and [6,8]. But the actual output is [8]. So this inconsistency suggests that maybe the pattern is different.\n\nWait, maybe the output is formed by looking for rows where the third element is the same as the fourth, and then output those pairs. Let's see.\n\nExample0's last two rows:\n\nRow3: third=1, fourth=1 \u2192 same \u2192 output [1,1].\n\nRow4: third=2, fourth=1 \u2192 not same. So only one row matches. But the output has two rows. So that's not it.\n\nExample2's fifth row: third=5, fourth=5 \u2192 same. So output [5,5]. Sixth row: third=5, fourth=2 \u2192 not same. Seventh row: third=5, fourth=2 \u2192 same as sixth. So only one row in Example2's input has third and fourth elements same. But the output is two rows. Hmm.\n\nAlternative approach: Maybe the output is formed by the elements that are at the positions where the row has a transition from one value to another. For instance, in a row like [2,1,2,1,2], the transitions are between 2 and 1. But not sure.\n\nAlternatively, think about the input as a matrix and the output as certain columns or rows. For Example0, the output could be the third and fourth columns. Wait, third column (index2) would be [2,1,2,1,2]. Fourth column (index3) is [1,1,1,1,1]. But the output is [1,1] and [2,1], which don't match.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the elements from the rows that have a certain length of consecutive elements. For example, in Example0, the second row is all 1s. Maybe taking two elements from that row. But the output has two rows. Not sure.\n\nWait, let's think of each example's output as the last two elements of the last two rows. For Example0:\n\nLast two rows:\n\nRow3: [0,0,1,1,1] \u2192 last two elements 1,1.\n\nRow4: [0,0,2,1,2] \u2192 last two 1,2.\n\nOutput is [1,1] and [2,1]. But that's reversed. So not matching.\n\nHmm. Maybe the output is the transpose of certain columns. For example, take the third and fourth elements of the last two rows and transpose them. For Example0, that would be [1,2] and [1,1], which would be [1,1] and [2,1]. Wait, that matches the output. Let's see:\n\nExample0's last two rows:\n\nRow3: third element 1, fourth 1.\n\nRow4: third 2, fourth 1.\n\nSo if we take the third elements of the last two rows as the first elements of the output rows, and fourth elements as the second:\n\nRow3's third and fourth: 1,1 \u2192 output first row [1,1].\n\nRow4's third and fourth:2,1 \u2192 output second row [2,1]. Yes, this matches Example0's output.\n\nSimilarly, Example2's last two rows are row5 and row6:\n\nRow5: third 5, fourth 5 \u2192 output first row [5,5].\n\nRow6: third 5, fourth 2 \u2192 output second row [5,2]. Which matches Example2's output.\n\nExample1's input has four rows. The last two rows are row2 and row3:\n\nRow2: third element 8, fourth 6.\n\nRow3: third element6, fourth 8.\n\nTaking their third and fourth elements and creating rows:\n\nFrom row2: [8,6]\n\nFrom row3: [6,8]\n\nBut the output is [8]. Hmm, this doesn't fit. So why in Example1 the output is different?\n\nWait, maybe there's a condition: only take the last two rows if they are the same length as the output rows. Or perhaps if the third and fourth elements are the same. In Example1, the third and fourth elements of the last two rows are 8,6 and 6,8. Which are different. But in Example0 and Example2, the third and fourth elements are [1,1] and [2,1] (Example0's last two rows) and [5,5], [5,2] (Example2's last two rows). But in Example1, the output is [8]. So there's an inconsistency here.\n\nWait, maybe in Example1, the output is the third element of the first row. Let's check:\n\nExample1's first row third element is 0. Output is [8]. Doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the third element of the middle rows. For Example1, which has four rows, middle rows are row1 and row2. Their third elements are 6 and 8. So output would be [6,8]. But the actual output is [8]. Doesn't match.\n\nHmm, this is confusing. Let's think again. For Example1's output [8], what if it's the third element of the second row. The second row (index1) is [6,8,6,8], third element is 6. Not matching. Third element of third row (index2) is 8. So if output is [8], maybe taking the third element of the third row. But why that row?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the third element of the row with the highest sum. Let's calculate row sums for Example1:\n\nRow0: 8+6+0+6=20\n\nRow1:6+8+6+8=28\n\nRow2:8+6+8+6=28\n\nRow3:6+8+6+8=28\n\nSo multiple rows have the highest sum of 28. The third element of those rows would be 6,8,6. So not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the output is the third element of the first row with the highest sum. But row1's third element is 6. Doesn't match output [8].\n\nThis is getting frustrating. Let's try to find another pattern.\n\nLooking at the number of rows in the input and output:\n\nExample0: 5 input rows \u2192 2 output rows.\n\nExample1:4 input rows \u21921 output row.\n\nExample2:7 input rows \u21922 output rows.\n\nNot a direct relation. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is formed by the third and fourth elements of the rows that have a certain number of elements. For instance, in Example0, last two rows. But why those?\n\nAnother observation: in all examples, the output rows seem to be shorter than the input rows. So maybe the output is derived by taking a certain number of elements from each row, perhaps from specific positions.\n\nIn Example0, output rows have two elements. Input rows have five elements. The third and fourth elements of the last two rows give the output.\n\nIn Example2, same pattern: third and fourth elements of the last two rows.\n\nExample1 has four rows. The last two rows' third and fourth elements are 8,6 and 6,8. But the output is [8]. Why?\n\nWait, perhaps when the two elements are the same in both positions, they are combined. For Example1, the third and fourth elements of the last two rows are 8,6 and 6,8. But if we take the first element of each, 8 and 6, and second elements, 6 and 8. Maybe the output is the maximum of these. So max(8,6) is 8, max(6,8) is 8. But output is [8], not [8,8]. So that's not.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is the element that appears in both positions. But 8 and 6 are in the third and fourth positions of the last two rows. No overlap.\n\nAlternatively, the output is the first element that is repeated in the third and fourth positions across any row. For Example1, looking for a row where third and fourth elements are the same. Let's check:\n\nRow0: third element 0, fourth 6 \u2192 different.\n\nRow1: third 6, fourth 8 \u2192 different.\n\nRow2: third 8, fourth 6 \u2192 different.\n\nRow3: third 6, fourth 8 \u2192 different.\n\nNo rows have third and fourth elements the same. So output is empty. But the actual output is [8]. So that's not.\n\nHmm. Maybe the pattern is different for Example1. Let's think differently. The output is [8], which is a single element. Perhaps the output is the third element of the row that has the maximum value in the first position. Let's check:\n\nRow0 starts with 8, row1 with 6, row2 with 8, row3 with6. So rows 0 and 2 start with 8. Their third elements are 0 and 8. The output is 8. So that matches. So maybe, for Example1, the third element of the row(s) with the maximum first element. So in Example1, rows 0 and 2 have first element 8. Their third elements are 0 and 8. So the output would be 0 and 8, but the actual output is [8]. So perhaps taking the maximum of those third elements. 8 is higher than 0. So output [8].\n\nIn Example0, the rows with maximum first element (2) are rows0,2,4. Their third elements are 2,2,2. But the output is [1,1] and [2,1], which doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. So this approach works for Example1 but not others.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is the third element of the row with the highest value in the third position. For Example1, third elements are 0,6,8,6. The maximum is 8. So output [8]. That matches Example1's output.\n\nIn Example0, third elements are 2,1,2,1,2. Maximum is 2. But output is [1,1] and [2,1], which includes 2 but not as the only element.\n\nExample2's third elements are 5,5,5,5,5,5,5. So maximum is 5. Output includes 5s. So this could explain Example1 and Example2, but not Example0.\n\nThis inconsistency is confusing.\n\nAnother angle: the output for Example0 has two rows, which correspond to the last two rows of the input. Each output row is the third and fourth elements of the input's last two rows.\n\nExample1's output is one row. Let's see: the last two rows are rows2 and3. Their third and fourth elements are [8,6] and [6,8]. If we take the first element of each, 8 and6, and combine them? But the output is [8]. Perhaps take the maximum of these elements. 8 is the max. So output [8].\n\nExample0's last two rows' third and fourth elements are 1,1 and 2,1. So output rows are [1,1], [2,1].\n\nExample1's third and fourth elements of last two rows are 8,6 and 6,8. If we take the maximum of each pair: max(8,6)=8, max(6,8)=8. So output [8,8]. But the actual output is [8]. So that's not matching.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is the third element of the penultimate row. For Example1, the penultimate row is row2, third element is8. So output [8]. This matches. For Example0, penultimate row is row3, third element is1. But the output is two rows, so this doesn't explain it.\n\nThis is getting too time-consuming. Let's try to summarize:\n\nThe pattern observed in Examples0 and 2 is that the output consists of the third and fourth elements of the last two rows of the input. However, Example1 doesn't fit this pattern, as the last two rows' third and fourth elements are 8,6 and 6,8, but the output is [8].\n\nBut wait, maybe in cases where the last two rows' third and fourth elements form a certain pattern, like being palindromes or having the same elements, they are merged. For Example1, the third and fourth elements of the last two rows are 8,6 and 6,8. If we reverse the second pair, it becomes 8,6. So combining the two pairs would be 8,6 and 8,6. Then take the unique elements, which is 8 and6. But the output is [8]. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the third element of the first row that has a certain property, like the third element being the maximum in its row. For Example1, the third elements are 0,6,8,6. The maximum is8, which is in row2. So output [8]. For Example0, the third elements are 2,1,2,1,2. Maximum is2, but output doesn't include 2 as a single element. So inconsistency again.\n\nAlternatively, consider the number of rows. For Example0, 5 rows. Output is two rows. Example1 has 4 rows, output is one row. Example2 has 7 rows, output is two rows. So maybe the number of output rows is floor(number of input rows / 2) or something. 5/2 is 2.5 \u2192 2 rows. 4/2 is 2, but output is one row. So that's not.\n\nAnother thought: the output rows are formed by the third and fourth elements of the rows that have a change in their first element compared to the previous row.\n\nLooking at Example0:\n\nRow0 starts with 2.\n\nRow1 starts with 1 (change).\n\nRow2 starts with 2 (change).\n\nRow3 starts with 0 (change).\n\nRow4 starts with 0 (no change).\n\nSo the rows with changes are row1, row2, row3. The output has two rows, which is more than the number of changes.\n\nNot helpful.\n\nThis is really challenging. Given the time I've spent and the competition setting, perhaps I should assume that the pattern is taking the third and fourth elements of the last two rows of the input. This works for Examples0 and2. For Example1, perhaps there's a different rule, but maybe there's an exception. Let's see:\n\nTest Input has 7 rows. The last two rows are:\n\nRow5: [8,8,1,8,8,1,8]\n\nRow6: [8,1,8,8,1,8,8]\n\nTheir third and fourth elements (index2 and 3) are:\n\nRow5: third element is 1, fourth is8.\n\nRow6: third element is8, fourth is8.\n\nSo the output would be two rows: [1,8] and [8,8]. But wait, looking at the training examples, the outputs sometimes have different formats. For example, Example0's output is [1,1] and [2,1]. Example2's is [5,5] and [5,2]. So applying the same logic to the test input, the output would be:\n\n[1,8]\n\n[8,8]\n\nBut let me check the test input again:\n\nTest Input:\n\nRow0: [8,1,8,8,0,0,0]\n\nRow1: [1,8,8,1,0,0,0]\n\nRow2: [8,8,1,8,0,0,0]\n\nRow3: [8,1,8,8,1,8,8]\n\nRow4: [1,8,8,1,8,8,1]\n\nRow5: [8,8,1,8,8,1,8]\n\nRow6: [8,1,8,8,1,8,8]\n\nThe last two rows are row5 and row6.\n\nRow5: third element (index2) is1, fourth (index3) is8.\n\nRow6: third element is8, fourth is8.\n\nSo output would be:\n\n[1,8]\n\n[8,8]\n\nBut looking at the training examples, sometimes the output rows have different elements. However, this is the pattern that fits two of the three examples. For Example1, it's possible that the output is the third element of the penultimate row. The penultimate row of Example1 is row2: third element 8. So output [8]. But that's a different pattern.\n\nGiven the time constraints, I think the most consistent pattern across the training examples (excluding Example1) is taking the third and fourth elements of the last two rows. Therefore, applying this to the test input would result in the two rows [1,8] and [8,8]. But looking back at the training examples, the outputs sometimes have different elements. Let me check Example1 again. Its last two rows are:\n\nRow2: [8,6,8,6] \u2192 third element 8, fourth 6.\n\nRow3: [6,8,6,8] \u2192 third element 6, fourth8.\n\nSo the output would be [8,6] and [6,8], but the actual output is [8]. So why is that? Maybe there's another condition: if the elements are the same in both rows, take them. Otherwise, take the unique element. But in Example1's case, the elements are different. So perhaps the output is formed by taking the elements that are the same in the third and fourth positions of the last two rows. For Example1, there are no such elements, so maybe the output is the maximum element from those positions. 8 is the maximum between 8,6,6,8. So output [8].\n\nBut how to reconcile this with the other examples? For Example0, third and fourth elements of the last two rows are 1,1 and 2,1. The common elements are 1. So output would include [1,1] and [2,1], which is what is present. For Example2, third and fourth elements of last two rows are5,5 and5,2. Common element is5. So output would be [5,5] and [5,2]. Which matches. For Example1, no common elements, so take the maximum of all four elements (8,6,6,8) \u2192 max is8. Hence output [8].\n\nThis seems to fit all examples. So the pattern could be:\n\nFor each of the last two rows in the input, take their third and fourth elements. If there are any common elements between the two pairs, include them. Otherwise, take the maximum element from all four elements.\n\nWait, but in Example0, the last two rows' third and fourth elements are [1,1] and [2,1]. The common element is 1. So output [1,1] and [2,1]. But how does this relate to the common elements? The first pair has two 1s, the second has 2 and 1. The common element is 1, which appears in both pairs. So maybe the output is both pairs, and any shared elements are highlighted. But this is speculative.\n\nAlternatively, the output is simply the third and fourth elements of the last two rows, regardless of their values. For Example0 and Example2, this matches. For Example1, the output should be [8,6] and [6,8]. But the actual output is [8]. So this approach fails for Example1.\n\nBut since two out of three examples fit the third and fourth elements of the last two rows pattern, and the test input has seven rows (which would have last two rows 5 and6), the answer should be based on that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is the third and fourth elements of the penultimate and last rows. For Example1, which has four rows, penultimate is row2, last is row3. Their third and fourth elements are 8,6 and6,8. So output would be [8,6] and [6,8], but the example output is [8]. So this still doesn't fit.\n\nGiven the time I have, I think I should proceed with the pattern that works for Example0 and Example2, and see what the test input gives. So the answer would be:\n\n[1,8]\n\n[8,8]\n\nBut wait, looking at the test input's last two rows:\n\nRow5: [8,8,1,8,8,1,8] \u2192 third element is1 (index2), fourth is8 (index3).\n\nRow6: [8,1,8,8,1,8,8] \u2192 third element is8 (index2), fourth is8 (index3).\n\nSo output would be:\n\n[1,8]\n\n[8,8]\n\nBut looking at the training examples, the outputs don't have leading zeros or other changes. For example, in Example2, the last two rows' elements are [5,5] and [5,2], which match the output. So applying the same logic to the test input gives:\n\n[1,8]\n\n[8,8]\n\nBut maybe the test input's third and fourth elements of the last two rows are [1,8] and [8,8], which is the output.",

        "cot_2": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. So, the task is to look at the training examples and see how the input grids are transformed into the output. Let's go through each example one by one.\n\nStarting with Example 0. The input is a 5x5 grid. The output has two rows: [1,1] and [2,1]. Hmm. Let me look at the input rows. The first input row is [2,1,2,1,2], the second is all 1s, third is same as first, then [0,0,1,1,1], and last is [0,0,2,1,2]. The output is two rows. Maybe each output row corresponds to a pair of input rows? Let's see. The first output row is [1,1]. Maybe taking the first and second rows of the input and applying some operation. Let's check the elements. For the first column: 2 and 1. The output is 1. Maybe the minimum? 1. Second column: 1 and 1, output 1. Third: 2 and 1 \u2192 1. Fourth: 1 and 1 \u21921. Fifth: 2 and1 \u21921. So if we take min of each column between the first two rows, we get [1,1,1,1,1], but the output is [1,1]. Wait, that's two elements. Oh, maybe it's the first two elements of that min result? But in example 0's output, the first row is [1,1], which would be the first two elements of [1,1,1,1,1]. Then the second output row is [2,1]. Let's check the next two input rows: third row is [2,1,2,1,2], fourth row is [0,0,1,1,1]. Taking min of each column: 2 vs 0 \u21920, 1 vs 0 \u21920, 2 vs1 \u21921, 1 vs1 \u21921, 2 vs1 \u21921. So the min would be [0,0,1,1,1], but the output is [2,1]. Wait, that doesn't match. Hmm. Maybe another approach.\n\nAlternatively, maybe looking for the last two non-zero elements in each row? Let's check the input of example 0. The first input row is [2,1,2,1,2], but the output is [1,1]. Not sure. Let's look at example 1. Input is 4 rows: [8,6,0,6], [6,8,6,8], [8,6,8,6], [6,8,6,8]. Output is [8]. So maybe each row contributes something, and the output is a single element. How? If we take the first element of each row: 8,6,8,6. Maybe the maximum is 8, which is the output. But the output is [8], which is a single element. So perhaps for each column, take the max or min across rows, but that doesn't fit with example 0's output. Or maybe the output is the elements that are the same in all rows. For example 1, looking at each column. Column 0: 8,6,8,6 \u2192 no common element. Column 1: 6,8,6,8 \u2192 no. Column 2: 0,6,8,6 \u2192 no. Column3:6,8,6,8 \u2192 no. So that can't be. Wait, the output is [8], so maybe looking for the element that appears in all rows. But 8 appears in all rows except maybe the first row's third element is 0. So not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's the element that appears in the diagonal? Let's see. The first row's first element is 8. Second row's second is 8. Third row's third is 8. Fourth row's fourth is 8. But that's four 8s in the diagonal, but output is a single 8. Hmm.\n\nLooking at example 2. The input is a 7x7 grid. The output has two rows: [5,5] and [5,2]. Let's check the input. The first two rows are [2,2,5,2,2,5,2]. Then third row is all 5s. Then two more rows like the first, then the sixth row ends with 0s. The output is two rows. Maybe again processing pairs of rows. Let's see the last two rows of the input: [5,5,5,5,5,0,0] and [2,2,5,2,2,0,0]. If we take the max of each column, for the first two elements: 5 and 2 \u21925, 5 and 2 \u21925. So the first output row is [5,5]. Then maybe the next pair of rows? The seventh row is [2,2,5,2,2,0,0], but maybe pairing with another row. Or perhaps looking at rows 5 and 6? The fifth input row is [5,5,5,5,5,0,0], sixth is [2,2,5,2,2,0,0], seventh is [2,2,5,2,2,5,2]. Wait, the output is [5,5] and [5,2]. Maybe for each pair of consecutive rows, take the max of the first two elements. Let's check. The fifth row's first two elements are 5,5. The sixth row's first two are 2,2. Max would be 5,5 \u2192 [5,5]. Then sixth and seventh rows: 2 vs 2 \u21922, 2 vs 2 \u21922. But the output's second row is [5,2]. Hmm, that doesn't fit. Alternatively, perhaps it's the elements where the row above and below have the same value. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking the non-zero elements from the last two columns. Wait, in example 0's output, the last two elements of the fourth and fifth rows. Let's see. The fourth input row is [0,0,1,1,1]. The fifth is [0,0,2,1,2]. The output for example0 is [1,1] and [2,1]. The fourth row's last three are 1,1,1. Fifth's last three are 2,1,2. Maybe taking the third and fourth elements? Or maybe the first two non-zero elements from each of those rows. But example0's output rows are [1,1] and [2,1], which could correspond to the third and fourth elements of the fourth row (1,1) and fifth row's third and fourth (2,1). That seems possible. Let's check example1. The input rows are four rows. The output is [8]. The last two columns in each row? Let's see. The first row's last two are 0,6. Second row's last two are 6,8. Third's are 8,6. Fourth's are 6,8. The output is [8], which is not in the last two columns. Hmm, maybe that's not the pattern.\n\nAnother approach: looking for the output rows as pairs of elements that are the same in the same position across adjacent rows. For example0, perhaps in rows 1 and 2 (the second and third rows) where the elements are [1,1,1,1,1] and [2,1,2,1,2]. Comparing each position: where they are the same, maybe take those. The second and third rows have elements matching in positions 1 (1), 3 (1), etc. But the output is [1,1] and [2,1]. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the two most frequent elements in the grid. For example0's input, there are several 2s and 1s and 0s. But the output is [1,1] and [2,1], which might not align with frequency.\n\nWait, maybe the output is generated by comparing adjacent rows and taking the first two elements where the previous row's element is less than the current row's. For example, in example0's first output row [1,1]. Let's see. The first input row is [2,1,2,1,2], the second is [1,1,1,1,1]. Comparing each element: 2 vs 1 (current row element is 1, which is less than previous 2). So maybe take elements where the current row's element is less than the previous. For the first two elements: 1 (from second row) and 1. That gives [1,1]. Then the second output row [2,1] could be from the third and fourth rows. Third row is [2,1,2,1,2], fourth is [0,0,1,1,1]. Comparing elements: 2 vs0 (current is 0, which is less), 1 vs0 \u21920, etc. So maybe take the current elements where they are less than previous. But the output is [2,1], which doesn't fit. Hmm.\n\nAlternative idea: For each pair of consecutive rows, take the first two elements where the elements differ. Let's check example0. First and second rows: first elements are 2 and 1 (differ). Second elements 1 and 1 (same). Third elements 2 and 1 (differ). Fourth 1 and 1 (same). Fifth 2 and 1 (differ). So the differing elements are at positions 0,2,4. The output's first row is [1,1], which doesn't align. Maybe not.\n\nLet's look at example1 again. Input rows:\n\nRow0: [8,6,0,6]\n\nRow1: [6,8,6,8]\n\nRow2: [8,6,8,6]\n\nRow3: [6,8,6,8]\n\nThe output is [8]. How to get here? Maybe the output is the element that appears in the same position in all rows. But looking at column 0: 8,6,8,6 \u2192 alternates. Column1:6,8,6,8 \u2192 alternates. Column2:0,6,8,6 \u2192 different. Column3:6,8,6,8 \u2192 alternates. So no element is common in all positions. But the output is [8]. Maybe the element that appears in the first position of the first row and third row (both 8). But why?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the maximum element in the entire grid. The grid has 8,6,0,6 in row0, etc. The maximum is 8. So output is [8]. That works for example1. Then for example0, the maximum in the input is 2, but the output is [1,1] and [2,1]. So that doesn't fit. So probably not.\n\nWait, example2's output is [5,5] and [5,2]. The input has a lot of 5s. The maximum in the grid is 5. So maybe not the maximum.\n\nAnother approach: maybe the output is the elements that are present in the same position across all rows. For example, in example1, the third element of row0 is 0, which is unique. So no element is common in all positions. So that's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, looking for the positions where all rows have the same value. But in example1, that's none. So not.\n\nHmm. Let's think of the output as being formed by some operation on the input rows, perhaps combining adjacent rows. For example0, the output has two rows. The input has 5 rows. So maybe pairs of rows are processed. Let's see. The first output row could be from row0 and row1. The second from row2 and row3. Wait, but the input has 5 rows. So 0&1, 2&3, and 4? But example0's output has two rows. So maybe processing every other pair? Or the first two pairs. Let's think.\n\nIn example0's input:\n\nRows 0 and1 \u2192 [2,1,2,1,2] and [1,1,1,1,1]. If we take the sum modulo something? Or the difference. For example, subtract row1 from row0: [2-1, 1-1, 2-1, 1-1, 2-1] \u2192 [1,0,1,0,1]. Then perhaps take the non-zero elements? But the output is [1,1], which isn't matching.\n\nAlternatively, take elements where row0's element is greater than row1's. For example, row0 has 2,1,2,1,2. Row1 has all 1s. So positions 0,2,4 are where row0 is greater. The elements from row0 in those positions would be 2,2,2. But output is [1,1]. Not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the elements that are the same in consecutive rows. For example0's first two rows: looking for elements that are the same. In positions 1,3. But those are 1 and 1. So same. So the elements would be [1,1]. Which matches the first output row. Then for the next pair (rows2 and3). Row2: [2,1,2,1,2], row3: [0,0,1,1,1]. Comparing elements: position 2 has 2 vs1 (different), position3:1 vs1 (same), position4:2 vs1 (different). So same elements at positions 3. But output is [2,1]. Hmm. Not sure.\n\nWait, the first output row for example0 is [1,1], which could be the elements from row1 (all 1s) in the positions where row0 and row1 are different. Wait, row0 and row1: different in positions 0,2,4. So if we take row1's elements in those positions, they are 1,1,1. But output is two elements. Maybe first two? So 1 and1, which gives [1,1]. Then rows2 and3: row2 is [2,1,2,1,2], row3 is [0,0,1,1,1]. They differ in positions 0,1,2,4. So take row3's elements in those positions: 0,0,1,1. But output is [2,1]. Hmm. Not matching.\n\nAlternatively, for each pair of rows, take the elements where the previous row's element is less than the current row's. So in example1, rows0 and1: [8,6,0,6] and [6,8,6,8]. Comparing each element: 8>6 (no), 6<8 (yes), 0<6 (yes), 6<8 (yes). So elements where current is greater. So positions 1,2,3. The elements from current row (row1) are 8,6,8. But output is [8]. So maybe take the first element where this happens. But 8 is at position1. Then for rows1 and2: row1 [6,8,6,8], row2 [8,6,8,6]. Elements where row2>row1: 0 (8>6?), 8>6 \u21928 at position0? Wait, row2's elements are 8,6,8,6. So position0:8>6 \u2192 yes. Position2:8>6 \u2192 yes. So elements 8 and8. Output for example1 is [8], but this approach would collect elements from multiple pairs. Not sure.\n\nAlternative approach: Maybe the output consists of the elements that are in the same position in the first and last rows. For example0's first row is [2,1,2,1,2], last row is [0,0,2,1,2]. Comparing their elements: position0:2 vs0 (diff), position1:1 vs0 (diff), position2:2 vs2 (same), position3:1 vs1 (same), position4:2 vs2 (same). So the same elements are at positions 2,3,4. But output is two rows. Not sure.\n\nLet me try another angle. Let's look at the number of output rows. For example0, input has 5 rows, output 2. Example1: input 4 rows, output 1. Example2: input7 rows, output2. So output rows are roughly half the input rows. Maybe each pair of input rows becomes one output row. For example, in example0, 5 rows would pair into 2 pairs (rows0-1, rows2-3, row4 left alone?), but output has 2 rows. So perhaps first two pairs. For each pair of rows, generate an output row. Let's see.\n\nTake example0's first pair (rows0 and1). How to get [1,1] from them. Row0: [2,1,2,1,2], row1: [1,1,1,1,1]. Maybe take the minimum of each element. Min would be [1,1,1,1,1], but the output is [1,1]. Maybe take the first two elements of the min array. Then the output row is [1,1]. Then pair rows2 and3: row2 is [2,1,2,1,2], row3 is [0,0,1,1,1]. Min would be [0,0,1,1,1]. Take first two elements \u2192 [0,0]. But the output is [2,1]. So that doesn't fit. Alternatively, maybe take the maximum of each pair. First pair max would be [2,1,2,1,2], first two elements [2,1]. Not matching output [1,1]. Hmm.\n\nAnother idea: For each pair of rows, look for the elements that are the same in both rows. For example0's first two rows: [2,1,2,1,2] and [1,1,1,1,1]. The elements that are the same in both rows are in positions1 and3 (both 1). So the output row would be [1,1]. Then the next pair (rows2 and3): [2,1,2,1,2] and [0,0,1,1,1]. The same elements are in positions2 (2 vs1 \u2192 no), position3 (1 vs1 \u2192 yes), position4 (2 vs1 \u2192 no). So same elements are position3 \u2192 but output is [2,1]. Hmm, not matching. But wait, maybe the elements that are the same in adjacent positions. Like in the first two rows, positions1 and3 are same. But output is two elements. Maybe the first two positions where they are the same. In first pair, positions1 and3 are same (1 and1). But output is [1,1], which could be the first two same elements. But in the first pair, positions1 and3 are 1. So taking two elements from those positions? Or maybe the first two elements of the row where the two rows are equal. So in first pair, positions1 and3 are equal. So taking those values gives [1,1]. Then for rows2 and3: looking for positions where they are equal. Row2:2,1,2,1,2. Row3:0,0,1,1,1. Only positions3 and4: 1 and1, 2 and1 (no). So position3 is 1 and1. So the same element. So output row would be [1], but the example0's second output is [2,1]. Hmm. Doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe for each pair of rows, take the elements where the first row has a higher value than the second. For example0's first pair: row0 > row1: positions0,2,4 (2>1, 2>1, 2>1). So elements from row0: 2,2,2. The output is [1,1], which doesn't align. So no.\n\nWait, maybe the output is the first two elements of each row where the element is not zero. For example, example0's output rows [1,1] and [2,1]. Looking at the input rows. Maybe the output is formed by taking the first two non-zero elements from each row. Let's check:\n\nExample0's input rows:\n\nRow0: [2,1,2,1,2] \u2192 first two are 2,1. Output isn't this. But output is [1,1]. So probably not.\n\nAlternatively, looking for the first two elements that are common between two consecutive rows. For example, rows0 and1 in example0: common elements are 1 in positions1 and3. So taking those gives [1,1]. Then rows2 and3: common elements are 1 in position3. So maybe take 1 and look for another. Not sure.\n\nThis is getting tricky. Let's try to find a pattern that fits all examples.\n\nLooking at example2's output:\n\nInput has 7 rows. Output has two rows: [5,5] and [5,2].\n\nLooking at the input rows, the fifth row is [5,5,5,5,5,0,0], sixth row is [2,2,5,2,2,0,0]. The output rows are [5,5] and [5,2]. Maybe the first two elements of the fifth and sixth rows, but fifth row's first two are 5,5 \u2192 [5,5], which is the first output row. Then sixth row's first two are 2,2, but the second output row is [5,2]. Hmm, not matching. Alternatively, maybe the fifth row's third element is 5 and sixth's third is 5, but the output's second row is [5,2]. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the fifth and sixth rows in example2:\n\nFifth row: [5,5,5,5,5,0,0]\n\nSixth row: [2,2,5,2,2,0,0]\n\nIf we take the elements where they are the same, which is the third element (5) and the sixth (0). But output is [5,5] and [5,2]. Not matching.\n\nAlternatively, for each pair of rows, take the elements where the first row's element is greater than the second. In fifth and sixth rows:\n\n5 vs2 \u21925>2 \u21925\n\n5 vs2 \u21925>2 \u21925\n\n5 vs5 \u2192 no.\n\nSo first two elements would be 5,5 \u2192 [5,5]. That's the first output row. Then sixth and seventh rows:\n\nSixth row: [2,2,5,2,2,0,0]\n\nSeventh row: [2,2,5,2,2,5,2]\n\nComparing elements:\n\n2 vs2 \u2192 no.\n\n2 vs2 \u2192 no.\n\n5 vs5 \u2192 no.\n\n2 vs2 \u2192 no.\n\n2 vs2 \u2192 no.\n\n0 vs5 \u21925>0 \u21925\n\n0 vs2 \u21922>0 \u21922\n\nBut output's second row is [5,2]. So maybe taking the elements from the second row where the next row's element is higher. So sixth row's elements where seventh row's element is higher: positions5 and6. Seventh row's elements at those positions are5 and2. So the elements from sixth row are0 and0. But output is [5,2]. Hmm. Not sure.\n\nLet me think of another angle. The output for example0 is two rows, each with two elements. Example1 has one row with one element. Example2 has two rows with two elements each. So perhaps the number of output rows is equal to the number of times a certain condition is met across the input rows, and each output row's elements are derived from certain positions.\n\nAnother thought: the output rows are the center elements of the input grid. For example0, the input is 5x5. The center is row2, columns2. But example0's output has two rows. Doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is formed by looking for 2x2 squares in the input that form a certain pattern. For example0, maybe the output is taken from such squares.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the elements that are in the same position as the minimal elements in each row. For example, in example0's first row, the minimal element is 1 (positions1 and3). But output is [1,1]. Maybe taking the first two minima.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is the elements at the positions where a row starts to have the same value consecutively. For example, in example0's first input row [2,1,2,1,2], the consecutive elements change frequently. The first two are 2 and1. So no. But output is [1,1]. Not sure.\n\nThis is really challenging. Let's try to find a commonality between the outputs.\n\nLooking at example0's output: [1,1] and [2,1]. These could be the first two elements of row1 and row4.\n\nRow1: all 1s \u2192 [1,1,1,1,1], first two are 1,1.\n\nRow4: [0,0,2,1,2], first two are 0,0. But output is [2,1]. So that's not.\n\nExample1's output is [8], which is the first element of row0 and row2.\n\nExample2's output is [5,5] and [5,2]. The first two elements of row5 are [5,5] (row5 is [5,5,5,5,5,0,0]), and row6 is [2,2,5,2,2,0,0], but output's second row is [5,2]. So maybe the fifth row's first two elements and then sixth's first and third elements?\n\nAlternatively, looking for diagonal elements. For example0's output could be the elements at (0,1) and (1,1) \u2192 which are 1 and1. Then (3,2) and (4,2) \u21921 and2. But output is [2,1]. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the output is formed by taking the first occurrence of a new number in each row. For example0's first row, the numbers alternate. But output is [1,1]. Not sure.\n\nPerhaps the pattern involves looking for the first two elements in the input rows that are followed by three zeros. For example, in the test input, the first three rows end with three zeros. Let's look:\n\nTest input rows:\n\nRow0: [8,1,8,8,0,0,0]\n\nRow1: [1,8,8,1,0,0,0]\n\nRow2: [8,8,1,8,0,0,0]\n\nThese rows end with three zeros. So maybe the elements before the zeros are considered. For row0, the elements before the zeros are 8,1,8,8. Wait, the last three are zeros. So the elements before are the first four. But the output is not clear.\n\nAlternatively, in example2's input, the fifth and sixth rows have zeros at the end. The output for example2 includes [5,5] and [5,2]. The fifth row has elements [5,5,5,5,5,0,0], so the elements before the zeros are 5,5,5,5,5. But the output is [5,5] which are the first two of those.\n\nWait, example2's output [5,5] and [5,2]. The fifth row's first two elements are 5,5. The sixth row's first two are 2,2. But the output's second row is [5,2]. So perhaps not that.\n\nAnother idea: For each row in the input, if the row ends with a certain number of zeros, take the elements before the zeros and then pair them. For example, in example0's input:\n\nRow0: ends with no zeros.\n\nRow1: no zeros.\n\nRow2: no zeros.\n\nRow3: ends with three ones.\n\nRow4: ends with three elements:1,2. Wait, row3 is [0,0,1,1,1], which ends with three 1s, not zeros. So maybe that's not.\n\nAlternatively, looking for the position where the zeros start in a row. For example, in example0's row3: [0,0,1,1,1], zeros are at the first two positions. Then the first non-zero elements are 1,1,1. But output for example0's first row is [1,1]. Maybe taking the first two non-zero elements. But in row3, the first two non-zero are 1 and1. Which matches the output row [1,1]. But example0's output has two rows. So maybe rows3 and4. Row3: [0,0,1,1,1] \u2192 first two non-zero are1,1. Row4: [0,0,2,1,2] \u2192 first two non-zero are2,1. Which matches the output [1,1] and [2,1]. Yes! This seems to fit.\n\nLet's check example0's output. The input rows are:\n\nRow0: [2,1,2,1,2] \u2192 no zeros. So first two elements are2,1.\n\nBut output rows are [1,1] and [2,1]. So maybe this is not the case. Unless we are considering rows that have zeros. Only rows3 and4 have zeros in example0. So the output is the first two non-zero elements of those rows. Row3: first two non-zero are at positions2 and3 \u21921 and1. So [1,1]. Row4: first two non-zero are at positions2 and3 \u21922 and1. So [2,1]. Which matches the output.\n\nExample1's input rows:\n\nRow0: [8,6,0,6]\n\nRow1: [6,8,6,8]\n\nRow2: [8,6,8,6]\n\nRow3: [6,8,6,8]\n\nOnly row0 has a zero (third element). So the first two non-zero elements in row0 are8,6. But the output is [8]. So this doesn't fit.\n\nWait, example1's output is [8]. Let's see. The input rows have row0: [8,6,0,6]. So zeros are in position2. The first two non-zero elements are8 and6. But output is [8]. So maybe this isn't the pattern. Unless there's another condition.\n\nAnother possibility: for each row that has trailing zeros, take the first two elements before the zeros. For example, in example0's row3: [0,0,1,1,1] \u2192 the zeros are at the start, not the end. So trailing zeros would be rows where the zeros are at the end. In example2's input, the fifth row is [5,5,5,5,5,0,0], which has trailing zeros. So first two elements before the zeros would be5,5. Sixth row is [2,2,5,2,2,0,0] \u2192 first two elements are2,2. But the output is [5,5] and [5,2]. So maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, for rows that have trailing zeros, take the first two elements of the non-zero part. For example, in example2's fifth row, after the zeros start at position5. The non-zero part is [5,5,5,5,5], first two are5,5. Sixth row's non-zero part is [2,2,5,2,2], first two are2,2. But the output is [5,5] and [5,2]. Doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. Let's revisit example0. The output rows [1,1] and [2,1] are from rows3 and4 of the input, which are:\n\nRow3: [0,0,1,1,1] \u2192 first two non-zero elements at positions2 and3: 1,1.\n\nRow4: [0,0,2,1,2] \u2192 positions2 and3:2,1.\n\nSo the output is the first two non-zero elements of each row that starts with zeros. Because rows3 and4 start with zeros. Example1's input has row0 with [8,6,0,6]. The zeros are in position2. So the first two non-zero elements are8 and6. But output is [8]. So maybe this isn't the pattern.\n\nWait, maybe the output is the first two elements of the first two rows that start with zeros. In example0, rows3 and4 start with zeros. So their first two non-zero elements. In example1, there's no row that starts with zeros. So output is [8], which might come from row0's first element, but not sure.\n\nAnother angle: perhaps the output is formed by the elements that are in the same position as the first occurrence of a zero in each row. For example, in row3 of example0: [0,0,1,1,1]. The first zero is at position0. So the elements after that? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, for each row, look for the position where the first zero appears, and take the elements before that. For example0's row3: zeros start at position0, so no elements before. So perhaps skip. But the output includes rows3 and4.\n\nThis is getting frustrating. Let me try to think of another pattern.\n\nLooking at the test input:\n\nTest input rows:\n\n[8,1,8,8,0,0,0]\n\n[1,8,8,1,0,0,0]\n\n[8,8,1,8,0,0,0]\n\n[8,1,8,8,1,8,8]\n\n[1,8,8,1,8,8,1]\n\n[8,8,1,8,8,1,8]\n\n[8,1,8,8,1,8,8]\n\nThe first three rows end with three zeros. The fourth to seventh rows do not. According to the previous hypothesis, perhaps take the first two non-zero elements from the rows that end with three zeros. But the first three rows end with three zeros. For each of those rows:\n\nRow0: [8,1,8,8,0,0,0] \u2192 elements before zeros are8,1,8,8. Take first two:8,1.\n\nRow1: [1,8,8,1,0,0,0] \u2192 first two elements are1,8.\n\nRow2: [8,8,1,8,0,0,0] \u2192 first two:8,8.\n\nBut the output would need to be two rows. Maybe combining these. But the training examples' output formats vary. For example, example1's output has one row. So maybe this isn't the pattern.\n\nAlternatively, looking for the elements that are in the positions where the zeros start. For example, in the first three rows of the test input, zeros start at position4. So elements before that are positions0-3. Taking the last two of those for each row. So:\n\nRow0:8,1,8,8 \u2192 last two:8,8.\n\nRow1:1,8,8,1 \u2192 last two:8,1.\n\nRow2:8,8,1,8 \u2192 last two:1,8.\n\nBut how to form the output from this. The test input's expected output would then be:\n\nBut according to the training examples, the output rows are pairs. For example0's output is two rows. Test input has three rows ending with three zeros, but perhaps the output is made by processing each such row and taking the first two elements before the zeros. So row0:8,1. Row1:1,8. Row2:8,8. But then what? But the training examples have varying numbers. Example1's output is a single element.\n\nAlternatively, the output for the test input would be the elements in the positions where the trailing zeros start, but that's unclear.\n\nAnother approach: Let's look for the output rows in the training examples and see if they appear as parts of the input.\n\nExample0's output rows are [1,1] and [2,1]. Looking at example0's input, row1 is all 1s, so [1,1] is part of that. Row4 has [2,1,2,1,2] \u2192 but output is [2,1]. Not sure.\n\nExample1's output is [8], which is present in row0's first element.\n\nExample2's output is [5,5] and [5,2]. Looking at the input, the fifth row is [5,5,5,5,5,0,0], so first two are5,5. The sixth row is [2,2,5,2,2,0,0], so first two are2,2. But the output's second row is [5,2]. Maybe combining elements from adjacent rows. Fifth row's third element is5 and sixth row's third is5. So [5,5], then sixth row's third (5) and seventh row's third (5 again). No, output is [5,2]. Hmm.\n\nThis is really challenging. Let's think differently. Maybe the output is formed by looking at the first two elements of the rows that have the maximum number of occurrences. For example, in example0, the first two rows have [2,1] and [1,1]. The output is [1,1] and [2,1]. Maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, the output is formed by taking the first two elements of each row in the input, but only for rows that are duplicated. For example0, the first row appears again as row2. So take their first two elements:2,1 and2,1. But output is [1,1] and [2,1]. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, looking for rows that are palindromes. For example, row0 in example0 is [2,1,2,1,2], which is a palindrome. But output rows aren't related to that.\n\nAnother idea: The output consists of pairs of elements that are diagonally opposite in some subgrid. For example, in example0's input, maybe the top-left and bottom-right of a 2x2 grid. But I don't see how that fits.\n\nAlternatively, the output is the elements at the positions where a certain pattern repeats across the rows. For example, in example0's output [1,1], it could be that in the first two rows, the elements at positions1 and3 are 1. But this is speculative.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and not finding a clear pattern, I'll try to hypothesize based on the examples.\n\nLooking at example0's output:\n\nThe output rows are [1,1] and [2,1]. These could be the third and fourth elements of rows3 and4. Row3: [0,0,1,1,1] \u2192 elements at indices 2 and3 are1,1. Row4: indices2 and3 are2,1. So the output is those pairs. \n\nExample2's output is [5,5] and [5,2]. Looking at the fifth and sixth rows:\n\nFifth row: [5,5,5,5,5,0,0]. Elements at indices2 and3 are5,5.\n\nSixth row: [2,2,5,2,2,0,0]. Indices2 and3 are5,2. So output is those pairs.\n\nExample1's output is [8]. The input has four rows. Looking for elements at indices2 and3. Row0: indices2 is0, row1:6, row2:8, row3:6. The output is8, which is the element at index2 of row2.\n\nSo the pattern could be: for each pair of consecutive rows starting from the third row (since example0's output rows are from rows3 and4), take the elements at indices2 and3. \n\nWait, in example0:\n\nRow3 and row4:\n\nRow3 indices2 and3:1 and1 \u2192 [1,1].\n\nRow4 indices2 and3:2 and1 \u2192 [2,1].\n\nWhich matches the output. For example2's fifth and sixth rows:\n\nFifth row indices2 and3:5,5 \u2192 [5,5].\n\nSixth row indices2 and3:5,2 \u2192 [5,2]. Which matches the output.\n\nExample1's input is four rows. According to this pattern, rows3 would have indices2 and3. Row3's indices2 and3 are6 and8. But example1's output is [8]. So this doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. Alternatively, perhaps the output is formed by taking the elements at the third and fourth positions of each row that has a certain condition, like ending with zeros.\n\nIn example0's rows3 and4:\n\nRow3: [0,0,1,1,1] \u2192 third and fourth elements are1,1.\n\nRow4: [0,0,2,1,2] \u2192 third and fourth elements are2,1.\n\nWhich matches the output.\n\nExample2's fifth row: third and fourth elements are5,5.\n\nSixth row: third and fourth elements are5,2. So output [5,5] and [5,2].\n\nExample1's input has rows:\n\nRow0: third element is0.\n\nRow1: third element is6.\n\nRow2: third element is8.\n\nRow3: third element is6.\n\nIf example1's output is [8], perhaps taking the third element of the third row. Which is8. So example1's output is [8].\n\nYes! So the pattern is: For each row starting from the third row (index 2), take the third and fourth elements (indices2 and3) of that row and the next row. For example, in example0:\n\nRows3 and4 are third and fourth rows (indices3 and4, since rows are 0-based). Their third and fourth elements are 1,1 and 2,1. So output rows are [1,1] and [2,1].\n\nExample1 has four rows. The third row is index3. Take its third element (index2) which is6. But output is [8]. So this doesn't fit. Alternatively, in example1, maybe take the third element of the third row (index2) which is8. Then output [8]. That fits.\n\nExample2 has seven rows. The fifth and sixth rows (indices5 and6) are considered. Their third and fourth elements (indices2 and3) are5,5 and5,2. So output [5,5] and [5,2].\n\nTest input has seven rows. Starting from the third row (index2):\n\nRow2: [8,8,1,8,0,0,0] \u2192 indices2 and3 are1,8 \u2192 [1,8].\n\nRow3: [8,1,8,8,1,8,8] \u2192 indices2 and3 are8,8 \u2192 [8,8].\n\nRow4: [1,8,8,1,8,8,1] \u2192 indices2 and3 are8,1 \u2192 [8,1].\n\nRow5: [8,8,1,8,8,1,8] \u2192 indices2 and3 are1,8 \u2192 [1,8].\n\nRow6: [8,1,8,8,1,8,8] \u2192 indices2 and3 are8,8 \u2192 [8,8].\n\nBut according to the examples, the output should have two rows. So perhaps for every two rows starting from row3, take their third and fourth elements. For the test input, which has seven rows, the rows to consider are rows3 and4, rows5 and6. But how?\n\nWait, example0's output is two rows, which are from rows3 and4. Example2's output is from rows5 and6. So perhaps the output is formed by taking the third and fourth elements of the third and fourth rows. Wait, example0 has five rows. Third row is index3, fourth is index4. Their third and fourth elements are 1,1 and2,1 \u2192 output rows [1,1] and [2,1]. Example2 has seven rows. The fifth and sixth rows (indices5 and6) have third and fourth elements5,5 and5,2 \u2192 output [5,5] and [5,2]. Example1 has four rows. The third row (index3) has third element6, but output is [8]. So this pattern doesn't fit example1.\n\nAlternatively, the output is formed by taking the third and fourth elements of each row starting from the third row. For example0, rows3 and4 give two output rows. Example2's rows5 and6 give two rows. Example1 has four rows, so rows3 and4 (but index3 is the last row). Taking the third and fourth elements of row3:6 and8. So output would be [6,8], but example1's output is [8]. So this doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. Maybe example1 is an exception. Let's check example1's input. The output is [8]. The third row (index2) is [8,6,8,6]. The third element is8. The fourth row (index3) is [6,8,6,8]. Third element is6. So perhaps in example1, the output is the third element of the third row. Which is8. So output [8]. So the pattern could be: for each even-numbered row (starting from row2), take the third element and the next row's third element. But example0's third row is index2. Third element is2. But example0's output starts with [1,1]. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, the output is formed by taking the third and fourth elements of each row where the row number is even (starting from 0). For example0's rows0,2,4. But their third elements are2,2,1. Not matching output.\n\nThis is really tough. Let me try to summarize:\n\nThe pattern seems to involve taking certain elements from rows that are after a certain point. For example0's output comes from rows3 and4. Example2's output from rows5 and6. Example1's output from row2 or row3.\n\nThe common thread could be that the output is formed by taking the third and fourth elements of the last two rows of the input. For example0, which has five rows, the last two are rows3 and4. Their third and fourth elements are1,1 and2,1 \u2192 output [1,1] and [2,1]. Example2 has seven rows, last two are rows5 and6. Their third and fourth elements are5,2 and1,8. But example2's output is [5,5] and [5,2], which doesn't fit. So no.\n\nWait, example2's fifth and sixth rows (indices5 and6) are:\n\nRow5: [5,5,5,5,5,0,0] \u2192 indices2 and3 are5,5.\n\nRow6: [2,2,5,2,2,0,0] \u2192 indices2 and3 are5,2.\n\nSo output [5,5] and [5,2]. Yes. So it's the third and fourth elements of rows5 and6. So for example0's last two rows, rows3 and4, third and fourth elements are1,1 and2,1. So output [1,1], [2,1]. Example1's last two rows are rows2 and3. Their third and fourth elements are8,6 and6,8. Output is [8]. But according to this pattern, example1's output would be [8,6] and [6,8]. But the actual output is [8]. So this doesn't fit.\n\nBut example1's output is a single element, which may indicate that when there's only one row in the output (due to even number of input rows?), but example0 has five rows (odd), output two. Example2 has seven (odd), output two. Example1 has four (even), output one.\n\nSo perhaps the pattern is: For each pair of rows starting from the third row (index2) and onward, take the third and fourth elements. If there's an even number of such pairs, output them. Otherwise, take as many as possible.\n\nBut I'm not sure. Given the time I've spent and the need to answer, I'll proceed with this hypothesis. For the test input, which has seven rows:\n\nRows3: [8,1,8,8,1,8,8] \u2192 third and fourth elements are8,8.\n\nRow4: [1,8,8,1,8,8,1] \u2192 third and fourth are8,1.\n\nRow5: [8,8,1,8,8,1,8] \u2192 third and fourth are1,8.\n\nRow6: [8,1,8,8,1,8,8] \u2192 third and fourth are8,8.\n\nSo pairs are rows3&4, rows5&6. But how to pair them. Maybe each consecutive pair:\n\nRows3 and4: third and fourth elements are8,8 and8,1 \u2192 output [8,8] and [8,1].\n\nRows5 and6: third and fourth elements are1,8 and8,8 \u2192 output [1,8] and [8,8].\n\nBut the expected output according to the training examples would have two rows. But this gives four rows. Not matching. So perhaps only take the first two pairs? Or every other pair.\n\nAlternatively, for the test input, considering rows3,4,5,6. Take the third and fourth elements of each. So:\n\nRow3:8,8 \u2192 [8,8]\n\nRow4:8,1 \u2192 [8,1]\n\nRow5:1,8 \u2192 [1,8]\n\nRow6:8,8 \u2192 [8,8]\n\nBut the output needs to have two rows. So perhaps take the first two and last two? Or pairs of rows. For example:\n\nRows3 and4 \u2192 [8,8] and [8,1]\n\nRows5 and6 \u2192 [1,8] and [8,8]\n\nBut the output examples have two rows. So perhaps take the first two rows of these. But why?\n\nAlternatively, in example2, there are seven rows. The output is two rows from rows5 and6. So perhaps for the test input, the output would be from rows5 and6. Their third and fourth elements are1,8 and8,8. So output [1,8] and [8,8]. But according to the pattern in example2, it's rows5 and6. So the test input's rows5 and6 are:\n\nRow5: third and fourth elements are1,8 \u2192 [1,8]\n\nRow6: third and fourth elements are8,8 \u2192 [8,8]\n\nSo the output would be:\n\n[1,8]\n\n[8,8]\n\nBut I need to check if this aligns with the training examples.\n\nExample0's output is from rows3 and4.\n\nExample2's output is from rows5 and6.\n\nSo the pattern is: take the third and fourth elements of the last two rows of the input. \n\nExample0 has five rows. Last two rows are3 and4 \u2192 output their third and fourth elements.\n\nExample1 has four rows. Last two rows are2 and3. Their third and fourth elements are8,6 and6,8. Output would be [8,6] and [6,8], but example1's output is [8]. So this doesn't fit. \n\nExample1's output is a single element, which suggests that maybe when the number of rows is even, it's different. But I'm not sure.\n\nThis is really challenging. Given the time I have, I'll proceed with the pattern that the output is the third and fourth elements of the last two rows. For the test input, this would be rows5 and6:\n\nRow5: third and fourth elements \u21921 and8.\n\nRow6: third and fourth \u21928 and8.\n\nSo output would be:\n\n[1,8]\n\n[8,8]\n\nBut looking back at the training examples, example2's rows5 and6 are the last two of the seven rows, and their third and fourth elements are5,5 and5,2 \u2192 output [5,5] and [5,2]. \n\nSimilarly, example0's last two rows: third and fourth elements are1,1 and2,1 \u2192 output [1,1] and [2,1].\n\nThus, applying this pattern to the test input, the last two rows are rows5 and6. Row5: third element is1, fourth is8 \u2192 [1,8]. Row6: third is8, fourth is8 \u2192 [8,8]. So output would be:\n\n[1,8]\n\n[8,8]\n\nBut I need to check the test input's rows. Let's confirm:\n\nTest input:\n\nRow5: [8,8,1,8,8,1,8] \u2192 indices2 and3 are1,8 \u2192 [1,8]\n\nRow6: [8,1,8,8,1,8,8] \u2192 indices2 and3 are8,8 \u2192 [8,8]\n\nSo output would be two rows: [1,8] and [8,8].\n\nBut according to the training examples, outputs have varying numbers of elements. For example, example0's output rows are two elements each, example1's output is one element. But in example1's case, if the pattern were to take the third and fourth elements of the last two rows, which are rows3 and4 (but example1 has four rows, rows3 is the last). So maybe for even-numbered input rows, take only one row. But this is speculative.\n\nAlternatively, the number of output rows is half the number of input rows, rounded down. Example0 has5 rows \u21922 output rows. Example1 has4 \u21922 output rows. But example1's output is one row. So this doesn't fit.\n\nGiven the time constraints, I'll proceed with the pattern of taking the third and fourth elements of the last two rows for the test input."
