        "cot_1": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. So, looking at the training examples, the input is a matrix, and the output is a larger matrix. The first thing I notice is that the output matrices are bigger in size than the input. Let's check the dimensions.\n\nIn Example 0, the input is a 3x3 matrix, and the output is 6x6. So the output's dimensions are double the input's. Similarly, Example 1's input is 6x6, and the output is 12x12. Example 2 has an input of 2x2 and output 4x4. So the pattern seems to be that each dimension is doubled. So for a test input that's 4x4, the output should be 8x8. That makes sense.\n\nNow, how are the elements transformed? Let's look at Example 0. The input has 2s and 0s. The output seems to have 8s and 2s arranged in a pattern. For instance, the first row of input [2,0,0] becomes [2,0,8,2,0,8]. So each element is expanded into two elements? Wait, the original row has 3 elements, and the output row has 6, which is 3*2. So each element is replaced by two elements. But how?\n\nLooking at the first input row [2,0,0], the output row is [2,0,8,2,0,8]. So it's like taking each element and appending another element. For 2, it becomes 2 followed by 8. For 0, it's 0 followed by 8? Wait, the first element is 2, then 0, then 0. So their expansion is [2,0,8], then [2,0,8] again? Or maybe each element is duplicated, but modified. Alternatively, maybe each row is duplicated and modified.\n\nWait, in Example 0's output, there are six rows. The original input was 3 rows. So each input row is transformed into two output rows. Let's check. The input has 3 rows, output 6. So 3x2. Similarly, Example 1's input is 6 rows, output 12. So each input row becomes two output rows. Similarly for columns. So the transformation is doubling both rows and columns, possibly by tiling or some pattern.\n\nLooking at Example 0's output:\n\nOriginal row [2,0,0] becomes [2,0,8,2,0,8] in the first output row. Then the second output row is [8,0,8,8,0,8]. Then third [8,0,2,8,0,2], and then the next three rows repeat the first three. Hmm, maybe each input row is generating two output rows, and then the entire set is duplicated. Wait, the output for Example 0 has 6 rows, which is double the input's 3. So each input row is mapped to two output rows. Similarly, columns: each input column becomes two columns, but with some transformation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the matrix is expanded by a factor of 2 in both directions, but with specific rules for replacing elements. Let's look at the elements.\n\nIn Example 0, the input has 2s in positions (0,0) and (2,2). The output's first row has 2 in the first position and 8 in the third. Then, the third element of the original row (0,0,0) is mapped to 8, 2? Not sure.\n\nAnother approach: Let's consider that each element in the input is transformed into a 2x2 block in the output. So for a 3x3 input, each element becomes a 2x2 block, leading to 6x6 output. Let's check.\n\nFor example, the input element at (0,0) is 2. Then in the output, the corresponding 2x2 block would be:\n\n[2, ... ]\n\nWait, let's take Example 0's input. The first row is [2,0,0]. If each element becomes a 2x2 block, then the first row of the output would be 2 followed by its 2x2 block. Wait, but the output rows are longer. So each element in the input row is replaced by two elements in the output row. So perhaps each input row is duplicated and modified.\n\nAlternatively, looking at Example 2's input:\n\nInput is 2x2:\n\n[0,4]\n[0,0]\n\nOutput is 4x4:\n\n[0,4,0,4]\n[0,8,0,8]\n[0,4,0,4]\n[0,8,0,8]\n\nHmm. The original 0 and 4 in the first row become [0,4,0,4], which is the original row repeated twice. But the second row of the input [0,0] becomes [0,8,0,8] in the first output row. Then the third row repeats the first output row of the first input row, and the fourth row repeats the second output row of the first input row. Wait, maybe each input row is transformed into two output rows, and each input element is transformed into two elements. For example, 0 becomes 0 and 8, and 4 becomes 4 and 0? Or maybe depends on the original value.\n\nIn Example 2, the input element 4 becomes 4 and then 0 in the same row? Wait, the first output row is [0,4,0,4], which is the original row [0,4] followed by [0,4]. But the second row is [0,8,0,8]. So maybe the original row is followed by a modified version where 4 becomes 8. But why?\n\nLooking at Example 0's input: the element 2 becomes 2 and 8. So maybe for non-zero elements, they are kept in the first part and replaced with 8 in the second part. For zeros, they stay 0 but perhaps have an 8 added?\n\nWait, let's take Example 0's first input row [2,0,0]. The output first row is [2,0,8,2,0,8]. So each element is followed by 8 if the original was non-zero? Wait, 2 becomes 2 and 8. 0 becomes 0 and 8. Then the entire row is repeated. Wait, but in the output, the row is [2,0,8, 2,0,8]. So each element in the input row is transformed into two elements: the original value followed by 8 if it's non-zero, but maybe 8 otherwise? Wait, in this case, the 0s are followed by 8. But in Example 2, the 4 is followed by 0? Wait, no. Let me check Example 2 again.\n\nExample 2's input is [0,4] and [0,0]. The output first row is [0,4,0,4]. Then the second row is [0,8,0,8]. Then the third row repeats the first, and the fourth repeats the second. So each input row is transformed into two output rows. The first output row for the input row [0,4] is [0,4,0,4], which seems like the original row duplicated. The second output row is [0,8,0,8], which replaces 4 with 8. Then for the input row [0,0], the output rows are [0,8,0,8] and [0,8,0,8]? Wait, no. The input's second row is [0,0], which in the output becomes the second row as [0,8,0,8], then the fourth row is same as the second.\n\nSo maybe for each input row, you create two output rows. The first output row is the original row duplicated (each element is followed by itself), and the second output row is each element replaced by 8 if the original was non-zero, else 0. Or something like that.\n\nWait, in Example 0's first input row [2,0,0], the first output row is [2,0,8,2,0,8]. Wait, that's not exactly duplicating each element. Let's split into two parts. The first three elements are [2,0,8], then [2,0,8]. So perhaps the original row is expanded by adding 8 after non-zero elements and keeping 0 otherwise, then repeated.\n\nAlternatively, the first part is [2,0,8], then [2,0,8]. Hmm. Let's think: the original elements are 2,0,0. The first output row for this is 2 followed by 0, then 8, then again 2,0,8. Wait, maybe each element is transformed into a pair: if the element is non-zero, it's followed by 8, else followed by 0. So 2 becomes [2,8], 0 becomes [0,0]. Then the row becomes [2,8, 0,0, 0,0], but that's not matching the example. Wait, in Example 0's first row, the output is [2,0,8,2,0,8]. Wait, that's 2 followed by 0, then 8, then 2, 0, 8. That's not matching that idea.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each element is duplicated, but for non-zero elements, the second occurrence is replaced by 8. So 2 becomes [2,8], 0 becomes [0,0]. Then the original row [2,0,0] would be [2,8, 0,0, 0,0], but the example shows [2,0,8, 2,0,8]. Hmm, not matching. So maybe another approach.\n\nLooking at the output rows in Example 0:\n\nThe first three output rows are:\n\n[2,0,8,2,0,8]\n[8,0,8,8,0,8]\n[8,0,2,8,0,2]\n\nThen the next three rows repeat these. So it looks like each input row is transformed into three output rows, but that doesn't fit the dimension pattern. Wait, no. Original input has 3 rows, output has 6. So two per input row. So perhaps each input row is transformed into two output rows, each of which is twice as long.\n\nLooking at Example 0's first input row [2,0,0], the first two output rows might be:\n\n[2,0,8, 2,0,8]\n[8,0,8, 8,0,8]\n\nWait, but there are three output rows before the repetition. No, the output has six rows. The first three rows are unique, then they repeat. Maybe each input row is transformed into two output rows, but for 3 rows, 3*2=6, which matches.\n\nBut how to get those two rows from one input row. Let's see.\n\nLooking at the input row [2,0,0], the output rows for it are the first and second rows:\n\nRow 1: [2,0,8,2,0,8]\nRow 2: [8,0,8,8,0,8]\nThen row 3: [8,0,2,8,0,2]\n\nWait, but that's three rows. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused here. Let me count again.\n\nExample 0's output has six rows. The input has three. So each input row corresponds to two output rows. Let's see:\n\nOriginal rows are:\n\nRow 0: [2,0,0]\n\nRow 1: [0,0,0]\n\nRow 2: [0,0,2]\n\nOutput rows:\n\n0: [2,0,8,2,0,8]\n\n1: [8,0,8,8,0,8]\n\n2: [8,0,2,8,0,2]\n\n3: same as 0\n\n4: same as 1\n\n5: same as 2\n\nSo each input row is generating two output rows? Wait, but then three input rows would generate six output rows, which matches. But how does the first input row generate the first three output rows? Because in this example, the first input row seems to generate three output rows. That doesn't fit. Hmm. Maybe there's a different pattern.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the entire input matrix is being mirrored or rotated and then combined. For example, the output could be the original matrix combined with a transformed version, creating a larger matrix.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the 8s in the output, maybe they're forming a border or filling around the original numbers. But in Example 0, the 8s are in specific positions. Let's see.\n\nAnother idea: The output matrix is created by tiling the input matrix, but with some modification. For instance, each cell in the input is expanded into a 2x2 block in the output, with the original value in certain positions and 8s elsewhere. For example, in Example 0, the 2 in (0,0) becomes a 2x2 block with 2 in top-left, 8s in other positions. But looking at the first row of the output:\n\n[2,0,8,2,0,8]\n\nThis seems to have two copies of [2,0,8]. So maybe each input element is replaced by two elements in the row direction. For non-zero elements, the second element is 8. For zero elements, maybe it's 0 followed by 8. Then each row is duplicated with some modification.\n\nAlternatively, the output rows are created by duplicating the input row, inserting 8s in certain positions. For example, in Example 0's first input row [2,0,0], the output row is [2,0,8, 2,0,8]. So the original row is followed by inserting 8s after each element. Wait, but here each element is followed by 8. But why the 8s in the third and sixth positions? So it's like for each element in the input row, we append 8. Then repeat the row twice. Wait, but the length would be doubled. The original row has 3 elements. Appending 8 after each would make 6 elements. For example, [2,8, 0,8, 0,8], but the actual output is [2,0,8, 2,0,8]. Hmm, that's different.\n\nWait, maybe the row is first duplicated, then modified. Like, take the original row, and then create a new row where non-zero elements are replaced by 8, then interleave them. For example, original row [2,0,0], then modified row [8,0,8], then concatenate them, but that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, for each input row, create two output rows. The first is the original row elements followed by 8s where non-zero, and the second is 8s followed by the original elements. Not sure.\n\nAnother angle: Let's look at the sum of elements. For example, in Example 0, input has 2+0+0 + 0+0+0 + 0+0+2 = 4. The output's sum would be 2+8+0+8+8+2 etc. But I'm not sure if the sum is preserved or transformed in a particular way. Maybe not.\n\nLooking at Example 1's input, which has 5s. The output has 5s and 8s. For instance, in the first output row, [8,5,0,0,0,8,8,5,0,0,0,8]. So 5 is preserved, but other elements are 8 or 0.\n\nWait, perhaps the non-zero elements in the input are preserved, and zeros are replaced with 8s in certain positions. But in Example 0, the 2s are preserved, and the 0s become 8s in some positions. But it's not straightforward.\n\nAlternatively, the pattern involves rotating or reflecting the matrix. For example, the output might be a combination of the original matrix and its mirror image, but with modifications. Let's see.\n\nIn Example 0's input, the matrix has 2s at (0,0) and (2,2). The output has these 2s and 8s arranged in a pattern. The output matrix seems to be a larger version with 2s placed in certain positions and 8s filling the rest. Maybe each 2 is surrounded by 8s in a specific way.\n\nAlternatively, think of the output as the input matrix scaled up by a factor of 2, with each original element placed at certain positions and 8s filling the gaps. For example, each element is placed in the top-left of a 2x2 block, and the rest are 8s. But in Example 0's first output row, the elements are 2,0,8,2,0,8. If the block is 2x2, then the first two elements would be 2 and 0, followed by 8 and 0. But the output row is longer. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, the output is created by tiling the input in a certain pattern. For instance, the input is repeated twice in each direction. For Example 0, the input is 3x3, output 6x6. So if the input is placed in the top-left and bottom-right quadrants, and 8s elsewhere. But not sure.\n\nWait, looking at Example 0's output, the first three rows of the output are:\n\n[2,0,8,2,0,8]\n\n[8,0,8,8,0,8]\n\n[8,0,2,8,0,2]\n\nThen this pattern repeats. So rows 0-2 are the same as rows 3-5. So maybe each input row is generating two output rows. Let's see.\n\nInput row 0: [2,0,0] \u2192 output rows 0 and 3?\n\nWait, no. Because rows 0 and 3 are the same. So perhaps the input rows are transformed and repeated. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, each input element is replaced by a 2x2 block. For example, a non-zero element like 2 becomes a 2x2 block with 2 and 8, and zeros become 8s. But how?\n\nIn Example 0's input, the (0,0) is 2. In the output's first two rows and first two columns, it's 2 and 8. Let's check:\n\nRow 0: [2,0,8,2,0,8]\n\nRow 1: [8,0,8,8,0,8]\n\nSo for the first column of the output, the first two elements are 2 and 8. Then the next two columns are 0 and 0, then 8 and 8. Then the next three columns are 2,0,8 again. So maybe each input element is represented as a 2x2 block where the top-left is the original value, top-right is 0, bottom-left is 8, and bottom-right is 8. But that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, the 2x2 block for non-zero elements is [original, 8; 8, 8]. For zeros, the block is [0,0;8,8]. But let's test this.\n\nFor input element 2 in (0,0), the block would be:\n\n2 8\n\n8 8\n\nBut the first two rows of the output's first column are 2 and 8. Then the next columns for the first two rows are 0,0, then 8,8. Wait, the first row of the output is [2,0,8,2,0,8], which for the first two columns would be 2 and 0. Then the second row is 8 and 0. So perhaps that's not the case.\n\nAnother approach: Let's look for the position of non-zero elements in the input and see where they end up in the output.\n\nIn Example 0, the input has 2s at (0,0) and (2,2). The output has 2s at positions (0,0), (0,3), (2,2), (2,5), and then repeated in rows 3-5.\n\nSo in row 0: 2 at positions 0 and 3.\n\nRow 2: 2 at positions 2 and 5.\n\nSimilarly, in the output for Example 1, the input has 5s at (0,1), (4,0), and (4,5). In the output, the 5s appear in positions (0,1), (0,7), (4,0), (4,6), (6,7), etc. So it seems like each non-zero element is duplicated in the output at intervals, possibly every n columns, where n is the original column count multiplied by 2.\n\nFor example, in a 3x3 input (Example 0), each non-zero element appears every 3 columns in the output, which is 3*2=6 columns. So 2 at column 0 and 3 (which are 3 apart) in the output row.\n\nSimilarly, in Example 2, input is 2x2. The 4 appears in columns 1 and 3 of the output row (0,4,0,4). So duplicated every 2 columns (original column count 2, 2*2=4).\n\nSo maybe the output is created by duplicating each column of the input twice. But for non-zero elements, the first duplication is the original value, and the second is 8. For zero elements, the first is 0, and the second is 8. Then, each row is duplicated with some modification.\n\nAlternatively, the columns are expanded by inserting 8s after non-zero elements and 0s after zeros. Wait, in Example 0's first input row [2,0,0], the output row is [2,0,8,2,0,8]. So each element is followed by 8 if the original is non-zero, and 0 otherwise. Wait, but in the example, 2 is followed by 0, then 8. Wait, no. Let me re-examine.\n\nOriginal row [2,0,0] becomes [2,0,8, 2,0,8]. So each element is expanded into two elements. For the 2, it's 2 and 0? But then 8 comes in. Hmm, not sure.\n\nWait, maybe the output is created by interleaving the original row with a modified version of the row. For example, take the original row and a modified row where non-zero elements are replaced with 8, then interleave the elements.\n\nOriginal row: [2,0,0]\n\nModified row: [8,0,8]\n\nInterleaving them would produce [2,8, 0,0, 0,8], which is [2,8,0,0,0,8]. But the example's first output row is [2,0,8,2,0,8]. That's different.\n\nAlternatively, for each element in the input row, output two elements: the original and 8 if non-zero, or 0 and 8 if zero. So:\n\nFor 2: [2,8]\n\nFor 0: [0,8]\n\nSo the row [2,0,0] becomes [2,8, 0,8, 0,8], but the example's first row is [2,0,8, 2,0,8]. Doesn't match.\n\nHmm, this is tricky. Let's think of Example 2 again. The input is [0,4] and [0,0]. The output is four rows. The first row is [0,4,0,4]. Second row [0,8,0,8]. Third row same as first. Fourth same as second. So for the input row [0,4], the first output row duplicates the row, [0,4,0,4]. The second row replaces 4 with 8, [0,8,0,8]. Then this pair is repeated. For the input row [0,0], both output rows are [0,8,0,8]. \n\nSo maybe for each input row, generate two output rows. The first is the original row duplicated (each element appears twice), and the second is the original row with non-zero elements replaced by 8 and zeros replaced by 8 as well? Wait, but in Example 2's second input row [0,0], the output rows are [0,8,0,8]. So zeros become 8 in the second output row.\n\nSo the rule could be:\n\nFor each input row, create two output rows:\n\n1. The original row with each element duplicated (so each element becomes two copies of itself).\n\n2. The original row with each element replaced by 8 if non-zero, and 8 if zero. Wait, but that would make all elements 8, which doesn't fit Example 2's case. Wait, in Example 2's first input row [0,4], the second output row is [0,8,0,8]. So 4 becomes 8, but 0 remains 0? No, no. In the second output row of Example 2, the 4 is replaced by 8, but the 0 is replaced by 8. Wait, no. The original row is [0,4]. The second output row is [0,8,0,8]. So the 4 becomes 8, but the 0 becomes 8? Or maybe all elements are replaced by 8 except zeros remain 0. But in Example 0's second output row for the first input row [2,0,0], it's [8,0,8,8,0,8]. So the 2 becomes 8, and the 0s remain 0. Wait, no, the first element was 2, and in the second output row it's 8. The 0s stay 0. So the rule might be: in the first output row, duplicate each element (element followed by itself), and in the second output row, replace non-zero elements with 8, and keep zeros as 0. \n\nLet's test this for Example 0's first input row [2,0,0]:\n\nFirst output row: duplicate elements \u2192 [2,2,0,0,0,0]. But the actual first row is [2,0,8,2,0,8]. Doesn't match. So that's not right.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the first output row is the original elements followed by 8s where non-zero, and 0s where zero. Then the second output row is 8s followed by original elements. Wait, not sure.\n\nWait, in Example 0's first input row [2,0,0], the first output row is [2,0,8,2,0,8]. So it's the original row [2,0,0] followed by [2,0,8], but how? Or maybe the original row is expanded by inserting 8 after each non-zero element. So 2 becomes [2,8], 0 becomes [0,0]. Then the row becomes [2,8,0,0,0,0], which is not matching.\n\nAlternatively, for each element in the input row, if non-zero, output the element followed by 8, and if zero, output 0 followed by 8. So for [2,0,0], it would be [2,8,0,8,0,8], which is not what's in the example. The example's first row is [2,0,8,2,0,8], which is 2,0,8 followed by 2,0,8. So maybe each input element is followed by 0, 8? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the entire input matrix is surrounded by 8s. But in Example 0, the input is 3x3 and the output is 6x6. So it's scaled by 2. But how?\n\nAnother angle: Let's look for the positions of the original elements in the output. For Example 0's input element (0,0) which is 2, in the output it appears at positions (0,0), (0,3), (3,0), (3,3). Similarly for (2,2) in the input, output positions (2,2), (2,5), (5,2), (5,5). So each original element is placed at (i*2, j*2), and also mirrored in some way. For example, each original cell (i,j) is placed at (i*2, j*2) and (i*2, j*2 +1), but with some pattern.\n\nWait, in Example 0's output, the original element (0,0) is at (0,0) and (0,3), which are 0 and 3. The original matrix is 3x3, so columns 0, 1, 2. The output is 6 columns, so 0-5. So columns 0 and 3 are the positions for the original column 0. Similarly, original column 1 would map to 1 and 4, and original column 2 to 2 and 5. So in the output, each original column j is represented at positions 2j and 2j+1. But in Example 0's first output row, [2,0,8,2,0,8], the original column 0 is at 0 and 3. Wait, 2j would be 0, 2, 4 for j=0,1,2. But here, it's 0 and 3, which is not matching. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, each original column j is duplicated and placed in two consecutive columns in the output. For example, for a 3x3 input, each column j becomes two columns in the output: 2j and 2j+1. So for j=0, columns 0 and 1; j=1, columns 2 and 3; j=2, columns 4 and 5. But the output for Example 0's first row has columns 0,1,2,3,4,5. So the original column 0 (2) would be mapped to columns 0 and 1. But the output row has 2 at 0 and 3. So that's not fitting.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output columns are a repetition of the original columns. For Example 0's input, the first column is [2,0,0]. In the output, the first column is 2,8,8,2,8,8. Not sure.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Let's try to look for a different pattern. The outputs contain a lot of 8s. The non-zero elements from the input are preserved in some positions, and 8s are added elsewhere. So maybe the pattern is to expand the matrix by a factor of 2 and fill with 8s, but place the original elements in specific positions.\n\nFor example, each element in the input is placed at (2i, 2j) in the output, and the surrounding cells are filled with 8s. Let's check.\n\nIn Example 0's input, element (0,0) is 2. In the output, it would be at (0,0), (0,3), (3,0), (3,3) because the output is 6x6. But in the actual output, the 2s are at (0,0), (0,3), (3,0), (3,3), etc. This seems to fit. For example, the first output row is [2,0,8,2,0,8]. So at (0,0) and (0,3) there are 2s. The surrounding elements are 0 and 8. But where do the 0s come from?\n\nWait, maybe the original matrix is placed in the top-left and bottom-right quadrants of the output. For Example 0's 3x3 input, the output is 6x6. The top-left 3x3 is the original, the bottom-right 3x3 is the original again. The other quadrants are filled with 8s. But that doesn't fit because the first row of the output is [2,0,8,2,0,8], which is not the original row followed by 8s.\n\nAlternatively, the output is formed by concatenating the original matrix with a modified version of itself horizontally, and then vertically. For example, each row is duplicated with some modification. But this is too vague.\n\nLet's try to think about the steps needed to transform the input to output.\n\nFor Example 2's input:\n\nInput row 0: [0,4]\n\nOutput row 0: [0,4,0,4]\n\nRow 1: [0,8,0,8]\n\nRow 2: same as row 0.\n\nRow 3: same as row 1.\n\nSo each input row is duplicated into two rows, where the first is the row doubled (each element repeated), and the second is the row doubled with non-zero elements replaced by 8.\n\nSo for input row [0,4], doubled is [0,4,0,4]. Then replacing 4 with 8 gives [0,8,0,8]. Then repeat this pair for the next two rows.\n\nSimilarly, for input row [0,0], doubling gives [0,0,0,0], but replaced with [0,8,0,8]. But in Example 2's output, the input row [0,0] generates rows [0,8,0,8] twice.\n\nSo the pattern seems to be:\n\nFor each input row, generate two output rows:\n\n1. The row where each element is duplicated (element followed by itself).\n\n2. The row where each element is replaced by 8 if non-zero, and duplicated (so 8 followed by 8 for non-zero, 0 followed by 0 for zero? No, in Example 2's second input row [0,0], the output rows are [0,8,0,8], which suggests that zeros are replaced with 8s in the second output row. Wait, no. For the input row [0,0], the first output row would be [0,0,0,0], but in the example, it's not present. Instead, the output rows are [0,8,0,8]. So maybe even for zero elements, the second row is 8s.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is:\n\nEach input row is transformed into two output rows:\n\n- The first output row is each element followed by itself.\n\n- The second output row is each element replaced by 8 if non-zero, and followed by 8.\n\nBut for zero elements, in the second row, they become 8? Let's test with Example 2's input row [0,4]:\n\nFirst output row: [0,4,0,4]\n\nSecond output row: [8,8,8,8] (if replaced non-zero 4 to 8, and zero to 8). But the actual second row is [0,8,0,8]. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, for the second output row, non-zero elements are replaced by 8, but zeros remain 0. So input row [0,4]:\n\nSecond output row: [0,8,0,8]. This matches Example 2. For input row [0,0], the second output row would be [0,8,0,8], replacing zero with 8? No. Wait, input row [0,0] would generate second output row [0,8,0,8], but that would imply that even zeros are replaced with 8 in the second row. But how?\n\nAlternatively, in the second output row, each element is replaced by 8, regardless of the original value. Then for input row [0,4], the second output row would be [8,8,8,8]. But Example 2's second output row is [0,8,0,8]. So that doesn't fit.\n\nThis is confusing. Let's think of Example 1. The input has 5s in certain positions. The output has rows like [8,5,0,0,0,8,8,5,0,0,0,8]. So the 5s are preserved in the first output row. The second output row has 8s. So perhaps for each input row, generate two output rows: the first duplicates each element and appends 8 for non-zero elements, and the second is all 8s.\n\nBut this doesn't fit with Example 0's output.\n\nAlternative approach: Let's consider that each input element is replaced by a pair of elements. The first is the original value, the second is 8 if the original is non-zero, and 0 if it's zero. Then each row is duplicated with some pattern.\n\nFor example, in Example 0's first row [2,0,0], each element becomes [2,8], [0,0], [0,0]. So the row would be [2,8,0,0,0,0]. Then duplicate this row. But the actual output row is [2,0,8,2,0,8]. Doesn't match.\n\nAlternatively, each element is replaced by [value, 8], then the row is followed by [8, value]. For non-zero elements, this would give 2,8 followed by 8,2. For zero elements, 0,8 followed by 8,0. So for [2,0,0], the row would be 2,8,0,8,0,8 followed by 8,2,8,0,8,0. But Example 0's first output row is [2,0,8,2,0,8], which doesn't fit.\n\nAnother possibility: The output matrix is created by replacing each element in the input with a 2x2 block. For non-zero elements, the block is:\n\n[value, 8]\n\n[8, value]\n\nFor zero elements, the block is:\n\n[0, 8]\n\n[8, 0]\n\nLet's test this with Example 0's input. The first element is 2, so block:\n\n2 8\n\n8 2\n\nBut the first output row is [2,0,8,2,0,8], which would correspond to the first row of the block for elements (0,0), (0,1), (0,2). Wait, (0,0) would be 2 and 8, but in the output row, the first two elements are 2 and 0. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, the 2x2 block for non-zero is:\n\n[value, 8]\n\n[8, 8]\n\nFor zero elements:\n\n[0, 8]\n\n[8, 8]\n\nTesting this for Example 0's first input row [2,0,0], the blocks would be:\n\n2 8 | 0 8 | 0 8\n\n8 8 | 8 8 | 8 8\n\nSo the first row of blocks would be [2,8,0,8,0,8], but the actual output row is [2,0,8,2,0,8]. So this doesn't fit.\n\nThis is really challenging. Let's try to find another angle.\n\nLooking at Example 0's output:\n\nThe first three rows are:\n\nRow 0: [2,0,8,2,0,8]\n\nRow 1: [8,0,8,8,0,8]\n\nRow 2: [8,0,2,8,0,2]\n\nThen rows 3-5 repeat these three.\n\nSo the output consists of two copies of a 3-row pattern. The input has 3 rows. So each input row contributes to two output rows, but with some transformation. For instance, row 0 of input generates rows 0 and 3, row 1 generates rows 1 and 4, etc. But in Example 0's case, the first three rows are unique and then repeated.\n\nAlternatively, the output is constructed by interleaving the input matrix with a transformed version where non-zero elements are replaced with 8, and then mirroring or tiling.\n\nAlternatively, think about the positions of the original elements. In Example 0, the 2 at (0,0) appears at (0,0), (0,3), (3,0), (3,3) in the output. Similarly, the 2 at (2,2) appears at (2,2), (2,5), (5,2), (5,5). So it seems like the original matrix is placed in the top-left and bottom-right quadrants of the output, and the other quadrants are filled with 8s. Let's check the output rows:\n\nRow 0: [2,0,8,2,0,8] \u2192 first three elements are [2,0,8], then next three are [2,0,8]. So the first half and the second half are the same. But why the 8 in position 2 and 5?\n\nPerhaps the output matrix is the original matrix concatenated with itself horizontally, but with certain elements replaced by 8. For Example 0's input, the original row is [2,0,0], and when concatenated with itself, it becomes [2,0,0,2,0,0]. Then, some elements are replaced with 8. For instance, the third element (original third element 0) is replaced with 8, and the sixth element (original third element 0) replaced with 8. But why those positions?\n\nAlternatively, in the concatenated row, every third element is replaced with 8. Not sure.\n\nAnother thought: The output is a combination of the original matrix and its mirror image, with some modifications. For Example 0, the original matrix is mirrored along the diagonal, and then merged with the original. But the output doesn't look like a mirror image.\n\nAlternatively, the output is the original matrix multiplied by a certain kernel or undergoing a convolution. But that's probably too complex.\n\nLet's try to see if there's a pattern in how the 8s are placed. In Example 0's first row, after the original elements, there are 8s in the third and sixth positions. So positions 2 and 5 (0-based), which are multiples of 3 minus 1. For a 3x3 input, 3 columns \u2192 output has 6 columns. So every third column has 8s. Wait, 3 columns in input \u2192 6 in output. So for each original column j, the output has columns 2j and 2j+1. But where are the 8s?\n\nLooking at Example 0's first row: [2,0,8,2,0,8]. The 8s are at positions 2 and 5. So 2j+1 for j=0: 1, j=1:3, j=2:5. But in the output, positions 2 and 5 have 8s. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the 8s are placed in every third position. For a 3x3 input, the output has 6 columns, so every third column is 8. But in the first row, the third and sixth columns are 8. So column indices 2 and 5 (0-based) are 8s. Which are indeed every third column starting from 2. Hmm. So maybe for each input row, the output row is the original elements followed by the same elements with every third element replaced by 8.\n\nBut how would that work for other examples?\n\nIn Example 2's input row [0,4], output row is [0,4,0,4]. Then the second row is [0,8,0,8]. So the 8s are at positions 1 and 3. Which are every other column. For a 2x2 input, output has 4 columns, so every second column is 8 in the second output row.\n\nSo maybe the rule is: For each input row, create two output rows. The first output row is the original row duplicated (each element appears twice). The second output row is the original row duplicated, but with every other element (starting from the first occurrence of each original element) replaced by 8. \n\nFor Example 0's first input row [2,0,0], duplicated becomes [2,0,0,2,0,0]. Then the second output row would replace every other element starting with the first: 2\u21928, 0\u21928, 0\u21928, 2\u21928, 0\u21928, 0\u21928. So row becomes [8,8,8,8,8,8]. But Example 0's second output row is [8,0,8,8,0,8]. So that's not matching.\n\nAlternatively, in the second output row, replace every other element in the duplicated row with 8. For the duplicated row [2,0,0,2,0,0], replacing every other element starting at position 0: 2\u21928, 0 remains, 0\u21928, 2 remains, 0\u21928, 0 remains. Resulting row [8,0,8,2,8,0]. Doesn't match Example 0's row.\n\nThis is really tough. Let's try to see if there's a pattern in the way the 8s and original elements are placed in the output.\n\nFor Example 0's input row [2,0,0], output rows:\n\nRow 0: 2,0,8, 2,0,8\n\nRow 1:8,0,8,8,0,8\n\nRow 2:8,0,2,8,0,2\n\nSo for each input element, the first output row has the original value followed by 0, then 8. Wait, but that's three elements for each input element. No. Maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, each input element is expanded into three elements. But for a 3x3 input, this would give 9 elements per row, but the output has 6 elements per row. So that's not possible.\n\nAnother Idea: The output could be the original matrix with each row and column repeated three times, but with certain modifications. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, think of the output as the input matrix being scaled by a factor of 2, and the new cells are filled with 8. But then the scaling would mean inserting 8s between the original elements.\n\nFor example, a 3x3 input would become a 6x6 output, where each cell is surrounded by 8s. Like:\n\nOriginal cell (i,j) becomes a 2x2 block:\n\n[original, 8]\n\n[8, 8]\n\nBut then, in Example 0's first row, the output would be:\n\n2 8 0 8 0 8\n\n8 8 8 8 8 8\n\n0 8 0 8 0 8\n\n...\n\nBut Example 0's output first row is [2,0,8,2,0,8], which doesn't match.\n\nThis is getting frustrating. Let's try to see if there's a pattern based on the input's non-zero elements' positions.\n\nIn Example 0's output, the non-zero elements (2s) are placed at (0,0), (0,3), (3,0), (3,3), (2,2), (2,5), (5,2), (5,5). So they are placed at positions where i and j are even or multiples of 3. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the output is created by placing the original matrix in the top-left quadrant and the bottom-right quadrant, with other quadrants filled with 8s. But in Example 0's input, the top-left 3x3 would be the original matrix, and the bottom-right 3x3 would be the original again. The other quadrants are filled with 8s. But the output's first row is [2,0,8,2,0,8], which seems like the first three elements are [2,0,8] and the next three are [2,0,8]. So this is like the top-left and top-right quadrants being copies of the original, but modified with 8s. Maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, the output is created by repeating the original matrix twice horizontally and vertically, but with modifications. For example, each row is duplicated and modified. But I'm not seeing it.\n\nLet's try to think of the output as being made up of tiles. For each input element, there's a tile in the output. For non-zero elements, the tile is [element, 8; 8, element], and for zero elements, the tile is [0, 8; 8, 8]. \n\nTesting this for Example 0's first input element 2:\n\nTile:\n\n2 8\n\n8 2\n\nFor input element 0:\n\nTile:\n\n0 8\n\n8 8\n\nSo arranging these tiles in a 3x3 grid (input) would create a 6x6 output. Let's see what the first row would look like.\n\nFirst input row: [2,0,0]\n\nSo the first tiles are:\n\n2 8 | 0 8 | 0 8\n\n8 2 | 8 8 | 8 8\n\nBut the first output row would be [2,8,0,8,0,8], and the second row would be [8,2,8,8,8,8]. But Example 0's first output row is [2,0,8,2,0,8], which doesn't match. So this doesn't work.\n\nAt this point, I think I need to look for another approach. Let's consider that the output is generated by applying a specific transformation to each element, then arranging them in a certain pattern.\n\nLooking at Example 2's output:\n\nInput row [0,4] becomes [0,4,0,4] and [0,8,0,8]. So each element is duplicated, but in the second row, non-zero elements are replaced by 8. \n\nFor the test input:\n\nTest Input is:\n\n[0, 0, 3, 0]\n\n[0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n[0, 0, 0, 3]\n\n[3, 0, 0, 0]\n\nSo a 4x4 matrix. According to the pattern, the output should be 8x8. Each input row would generate two output rows. For each input row, we need to generate two output rows. \n\nFor the first input row [0,0,3,0], the first output row would be [0,0,3,3,0,0,3,0], but not sure. Or perhaps each element is duplicated with some rule.\n\nAlternatively, based on Example 2's pattern, each input row is transformed into two output rows:\n\n1. Each element is duplicated (element, element).\n\n2. Each element is replaced by 8 if non-zero, else 0, then duplicated.\n\nWait, no. Because in Example 2's input row [0,4], the first output row is [0,4,0,4] (duplicated elements), and the second row is [0,8,0,8] (non-zero replaced by 8, then duplicated).\n\nSo applying this rule to the test input's first row [0,0,3,0]:\n\nFirst output row: each element duplicated \u2192 [0,0,0,0,3,3,0,0]\n\nSecond output row: replace non-zero with 8, then duplicate \u2192 [0,0,8,8,0,0]\n\nWait, but the original row has four elements. So duplicated would be eight elements. Let's see:\n\nOriginal row: 0, 0, 3, 0 \u2192 duplicated is [0,0,0,0,3,3,0,0]\n\nSecond output row: replace non-zero (3) with 8 \u2192 [0,0,8,0], then duplicated \u2192 [0,0,8,8,0,0,8,0]. But the second output row in Example 2 for [0,4] is [0,8,0,8], which is replace non-zero and duplicate each element.\n\nSo for each element in the input row, the second output row's element is 8 if non-zero, else 0, and then duplicated. So for 3 \u2192 8, duplicated to 8,8. For 0 \u2192 0, duplicated to 0,0.\n\nSo the first input row [0,0,3,0] becomes:\n\nFirst output row: 0,0,0,0,3,3,0,0\n\nSecond output row: 0,0,0,0,8,8,0,0\n\nBut looking at Example 0's first input row [2,0,0], the first output row is [2,0,8,2,0,8], which doesn't fit this pattern. So there's inconsistency. But in Example 2, the pattern holds. Maybe there's a different pattern for different examples.\n\nAlternatively, the rule might be:\n\nFor each input row:\n\n- The first output row is the original row with each element followed by 8 if the element is non-zero, else followed by 0.\n\n- The second output row is the same as the first output row but with the original elements replaced by 8.\n\nFor example, in Example 2's input row [0,4]:\n\nFirst output row: 0 followed by 0 (since 0 is zero), 4 followed by 8 (since non-zero) \u2192 [0,0,4,8]. Then duplicated \u2192 [0,0,4,8,0,0,4,8]. Wait, but Example 2's output row is [0,4,0,4]. So this doesn't fit.\n\nThis is really challenging. Given the time I've spent and the competition context, I'll try to infer the pattern from the examples and apply it to the test input.\n\nFrom the examples, the output is generated by:\n\n- Doubling the size of the matrix in both dimensions.\n\n- Each element in the input is replaced by a pair of elements in the output. The pair depends on whether the element is zero or non-zero.\n\n- For non-zero elements, the pair is [element, 8], and for zero elements, it's [0, 8].\n\n- Additionally, each row is duplicated with some transformation.\n\nWait, in Example 0's first input row [2,0,0], if non-zero elements are replaced by [2,8] and zeros by [0,8], then the row would be [2,8,0,8,0,8], but the actual first output row is [2,0,8,2,0,8]. So that's not matching.\n\nAlternatively, for non-zero elements, the pair is [element, 8], but for zeros, it's [0, 0]. Then the row becomes [2,8,0,0,0,0]. Still not matching.\n\nAlternatively, each element is followed by 8, but then the entire row is followed by the same row again. So for [2,0,0], it becomes [2,8,0,8,0,8, 2,8,0,8,0,8]. But the output row is shorter. No.\n\nMaybe the output is generated by repeating the input matrix twice horizontally and vertically, with some modifications. For example, each row is followed by a modified version where non-zero elements are replaced by 8. So for each input row, create two output rows: the original row duplicated, and the same row with non-zero elements replaced by 8.\n\nBut in Example 0's first input row [2,0,0], duplicated would be [2,0,0,2,0,0]. Modified would be [8,0,0,8,0,0]. But the first output row is [2,0,8,2,0,8]. Not matching.\n\nGiven that I'm struggling to find the exact pattern, I'll try to use the examples to guess the pattern for the test input.\n\nLooking at the test input:\n\n[0,0,3,0]\n\n[0,0,0,0]\n\n[0,0,0,3]\n\n[3,0,0,0]\n\nThe output should be 8x8. Each row is transformed into two output rows. For example, each input row of 4 elements becomes two output rows of 8 elements each. \n\nLooking at Example 1's input, which is 6x6, output is 12x12. The non-zero elements (5s) are preserved in certain positions, and surrounded by 8s. For example, in the first output row, the 5 is at position 1, and again at position 7 (assuming 0-based). So for an input element at (i,j), in the output it appears at (i*2, j*2) and (i*2, j*2 +1), but not sure.\n\nIn the test input, the non-zero elements are 3s at positions (0,2), (2,3), (3,0). \n\nApplying a similar pattern to Example 0 and Example 1, perhaps each non-zero element is placed at (2i, 2j) and (2i, 2j+1) in the output, followed by 8s. The zeros are filled with 8s in some positions.\n\nAlternatively, each non-zero element is placed at even positions, and 8s elsewhere.\n\nBut without a clear pattern, this is tough. Given the time constraints, I'll proceed with the following approach:\n\nFor each row in the input:\n\n- Create two output rows.\n\n- The first output row is the original row elements followed by 8 if non-zero, else 0.\n\n- The second output row is 8 followed by the original row elements.\n\nBut this is just a guess. For the test input's first row [0,0,3,0], the first output row would be [0,0,3,8], then duplicated to [0,0,3,8,0,0,3,8]. Second output row would be [8,0,0,3,8,0,0,3]. But this doesn't fit the previous examples.\n\nAlternatively, each input element is transformed into two elements: if non-zero, [value, 8]; if zero, [0,8]. Then each row is duplicated, leading to two output rows per input row.\n\nFor test input's first row [0,0,3,0], the transformed row would be [0,8,0,8,3,8,0,8]. Then duplicate this for the second row, but that doesn't fit the examples.\n\nGiven that I'm stuck, I'll look at Example 0's output and see that each input row is transformed into two output rows with 8s in certain positions. For the first input row [2,0,0], the first output row is [2,0,8,2,0,8]. The second output row is [8,0,8,8,0,8]. The third is [8,0,2,8,0,2], then it repeats. So the first three output rows are unique, then repeat. This suggests that each input row generates three output rows, but that contradicts the dimension doubling.\n\nGiven the time I've invested and the competition context, I'll proceed with the following approach based on Example 0 and 2:\n\nFor each input row:\n\n- Create two output rows.\n\n- The first output row is the original row elements followed by 8 if non-zero, else 0, then the row is duplicated.\n\n- The second output row is 8 followed by the original elements, then modified.\n\nBut this is vague. Another possible approach is to mirror the matrix and fill with 8s. For the test input, the output would have 3s mirrored with 8s around them.\n\nBut given the time, I'll proceed to format the test input's output based on the examples, assuming each input row is expanded by inserting 8s after non-zero elements and the matrix is doubled in size with repetition.\n\nFor the test input:\n\nEach row is doubled in size by inserting 8 after non-zero elements, and 0 after zeros. Then each row is duplicated with some 8s.\n\nAlternatively, looking at Example 2's input [0,4] becomes [0,4,0,4] and [0,8,0,8]. Applying this to the test input's first row [0,0,3,0], the first output row would be [0,0,3,3,0,0,3,0] (duplicated elements), and the second output row would be [0,0,8,8,0,0,8,0]. Then each of these rows is repeated four times (since the input has four rows), leading to eight output rows.\n\nBut the actual output would need to be 8 rows for the test input.\n\nGiven the examples and the time I've spent, I'll proceed with the following guess:\n\nFor each input row, create two output rows. The first output row is the original row elements followed by themselves (duplicated). The second output row is the original row elements replaced by 8 if non-zero, and 0 if zero, then duplicated.\n\nSo for the test input's first row [0,0,3,0]:\n\nFirst output row: [0,0,3,0,0,0,3,0]\n\nSecond output row: [0,0,8,0,0,0,8,0]\n\nThen repeat this for each input row. But the output would need to be 8 rows. Since the input has four rows, each transformed into two output rows, resulting in 8 rows.\n\nBut looking at Example 1, which has 6 input rows, the output has 12 rows. So this fits.\n\nApplying this to the test input:\n\nTest input:\n\nRow 0: [0,0,3,0] \u2192 output rows 0 and 1.\n\nRow 1: [0,0,0,0] \u2192 output rows 2 and 3.\n\nRow 2: [0,0,0,3] \u2192 output rows 4 and 5.\n\nRow 3: [3,0,0,0] \u2192 output rows 6 and 7.\n\nFor each input row, first output row is duplicated elements, second is replaced non-zero with 8 and duplicated.\n\nRow 0: [0,0,3,0] \u2192 first output row: [0,0,3,3,0,0,3,0], second output row: [0,0,8,8,0,0,8,0]\n\nRow 1: [0,0,0,0] \u2192 first: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0], second: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow 2: [0,0,0,3] \u2192 first: [0,0,0,3,0,0,0,3], second: [0,0,0,8,0,0,0,8]\n\nRow 3: [3,0,0,0] \u2192 first: [3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0], second: [8,8,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nBut looking at Example 1's output, the non-zero elements are preserved in certain positions and surrounded by 8s. So perhaps my assumption is incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, the output for the test input would be:\n\nEach input row is converted into two output rows. The first output row is the original row with each element followed by 8 if non-zero, else 0. Then duplicated. The second output row is the same as the first but with the original elements replaced by 8.\n\nFor example, for row 0: [0,0,3,0]:\n\nFirst output row: [0,0,3,8,0,0,3,8]\n\nSecond output row: [8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8]\n\nBut this doesn't match the examples.\n\nGiven the time constraints, I'll proceed to provide an answer based on the patterns observed, even if not entirely confident.",

        "cot_2": "Okay, let's tackle this puzzle. Hmm, the task is to figure out the pattern that transforms the input matrices into the output ones. Let's start by looking at the training examples to see if I can spot a pattern.\n\nStarting with Example 0. The input is a 3x3 matrix:\n\n[2, 0, 0]\n[0, 0, 0]\n[0, 0, 2]\n\nThe output is a 6x6 matrix. Let me compare the input and output dimensions. For a 3x3 input, the output is 6x6. That suggests each element in the input is being expanded into a 2x2 block in the output. But wait, the output rows have more elements. Wait, looking at the first row of the output:\n\n[2, 0, 8, 2, 0, 8]\n\nOriginal input's first row is [2,0,0]. The output row has six elements, which is double the original. So maybe each element is replaced by two elements. But how?\n\nLooking at the first input element 2. In the output row, the first two elements are 2 and 0, but then there's 8. Wait, maybe there's a mirroring or duplication with some transformation. Let's see:\n\nOriginal input row [2,0,0]. The output row starts with [2,0,8,2,0,8]. So maybe each element is being duplicated but with some modification. Wait, the 2 is followed by 0, then 8, then 2 again, 0, 8. Maybe the input row is mirrored and some operation is applied. Alternatively, perhaps each element is converted into a pair, but there's an 8 inserted. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is constructed by interleaving the original row with a transformed version. Let's look at the output rows. The first output row is [2,0,8,2,0,8]. If we split this into two parts: [2,0,8] and [2,0,8]. So maybe each original row is transformed into two rows, each being the original row concatenated with a transformed version. Wait, no, because the output matrix is 6x6, so each input row becomes two output rows? But Example 0's input is 3x3, output is 6x6. So each input row is transformed into two output rows, each of double the length. Maybe each input row is duplicated and modified.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the input is being expanded by tiling and adding some values. Let's check the positions where the original numbers are. In Example 0's input, there are 2s at the corners. The output has 2s at certain positions and 8s. Let's see the first row of output: [2,0,8,2,0,8]. The 2s are at positions 0 and 3, and 8s at 2 and 5. So maybe each original element is replaced by a pair, and then another pair of 8s? Or perhaps the original elements are surrounded or followed by 8s.\n\nLooking at Example 2: the input is a 2x2 matrix:\n\n[0,4]\n[0,0]\n\nThe output is a 4x4 matrix. The output rows are:\n\n[0,4,0,4]\n[0,8,0,8]\n[0,4,0,4]\n[0,8,0,8]\n\nSo each input row is transformed into two output rows. For the first input row [0,4], the first output row is [0,4,0,4], which duplicates each element. The second output row for that input row is [0,8,0,8], replacing the 4 with 8. Then the same for the next input rows. So the pattern here might be that each input row is duplicated, and in the duplicated rows, the non-zero elements are replaced by 8. Then, the entire matrix is perhaps mirrored or repeated again. Wait, the output in Example 2 is 4 rows, each of length 4. So the original 2 rows become 4 output rows by duplicating each and modifying. Then, each element in the original row is duplicated as well. For example, 0 becomes 0,0 and 4 becomes 4,4 in the first output row, and 0,0 and 8,8 in the second. Then perhaps this is done for each row and then mirrored vertically or something.\n\nWait, looking at Example 0's output. The input was 3x3, output 6x6. So each input row becomes two output rows. Let's see:\n\nOriginal input row 0: [2,0,0]\n\nOutput rows 0 and 3 (since the output has 6 rows) in Example 0:\n\nRow 0: [2,0,8,2,0,8]\n\nRow 3: [2,0,8,2,0,8]\n\nThen rows 1 and 4 are [8,0,8,8,0,8], and rows 2 and 5 are [8,0,2,8,0,2].\n\nWait, the output seems to have the first three rows and then the same three rows again. So the output matrix is the original transformed rows followed by a copy of them again. Or perhaps each input row is transformed into two output rows, and then the entire structure is duplicated vertically. But in Example 0, the output has 6 rows, which is 2x the original 3. So each input row becomes two output rows. Let's check that.\n\nOriginal input has 3 rows. Output has 6. So each input row becomes two output rows.\n\nSimilarly, in Example 1, the input is 6x6, output is 12x12. So again, each row is duplicated into two, leading to 12 rows.\n\nIn Example 2, input 2x2, output 4x4. So each row becomes two rows. So the pattern is: each row is transformed into two rows, each element in the row is transformed into two elements. But how?\n\nLooking at Example 2 again: input row [0,4] becomes first output row [0,4,0,4], then [0,8,0,8]. So each element is duplicated. For non-zero elements, in the duplicated row, they are replaced by 8. So in the first row of the output pair, the elements are duplicated (0 becomes 0,0 and 4 becomes 4,4), but wait, no. Wait the input row [0,4] becomes [0,4,0,4], which is [0,4] followed by [0,4]. So perhaps the original row is concatenated with itself. Then, the next row is [0,8,0,8], which is replacing the 4s with 8s and duplicating. So the first transformed row is the original elements duplicated (each element appears twice?), and the second transformed row is the same but replacing non-zero elements with 8.\n\nWait, in Example 2, the first output row for the input row [0,4] is [0,4,0,4]. So the original row is [0,4], and this is duplicated as 0,4 followed by 0,4. Then the next row is [0,8,0,8], which is 0,8 followed by 0,8. So for each input row, we create two output rows: the first is the original row concatenated with itself, and the second is the same but with non-zero elements replaced by 8. Then, perhaps this is done for each row, and the resulting rows are stacked vertically, and then the entire structure is duplicated again. Wait, in Example 2, the output is four rows. The first two rows are from the first input row, and the next two from the second input row. Wait, the input has two rows. Each becomes two rows. Then the output has 4 rows. But looking at the output:\n\n[0,4,0,4] \u2013 row 0\n[0,8,0,8] \u2013 row 1\n[0,4,0,4] \u2013 row 2\n[0,8,0,8] \u2013 row 3]\n\nSo rows 0 and 2 are the same, and rows 1 and 3 are the same. So perhaps each input row is transformed into two rows (original and modified), and then those two rows are repeated again. Wait, maybe the entire transformed matrix is duplicated vertically. For example, the first input row [0,4] becomes two output rows, then the second input row [0,0] becomes two output rows. But in the output of Example 2, the third and fourth rows are duplicates of the first and second. So that suggests that after processing all input rows, the resulting rows are duplicated again. So if input is 2 rows, transformed into 4 rows, then duplicated to make 8 rows. But in Example 2, the output has 4 rows, which would be the same as the initial transformation. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each input row is processed into two rows, and the entire matrix is mirrored. Let's look back at Example 0. The output rows are:\n\nRow 0: [2,0,8,2,0,8]\nRow 1: [8,0,8,8,0,8]\nRow 2: [8,0,2,8,0,2]\nRow 3: [2,0,8,2,0,8] (same as row 0)\nRow 4: [8,0,8,8,0,8] (same as row 1)\nRow 5: [8,0,2,8,0,2] (same as row 2)\n\nSo the output is the transformed rows followed by the same transformed rows again. So the entire transformed matrix is duplicated. So the transformation is: for each input row, generate two output rows (original and modified), then duplicate all those rows again. Or perhaps after processing all input rows into double the number of rows, the entire block is duplicated again vertically.\n\nIn Example 0, the input is 3 rows. Transformed into 6 rows (3 input rows \u00d7 2 each), but the output has 6 rows. Wait, but 3 input rows \u00d7 2 transformed rows each gives 6 rows, which matches the output. However, the output in Example 0 has the first 3 rows and then the same 3 rows again. So perhaps each input row is transformed into two rows, but then the entire transformed matrix is duplicated. Wait, 3 input rows \u2192 6 transformed rows (each input row becomes two output rows). But in the output, it's 6 rows. However, in Example 0's output, the first three rows are the transformed rows, and then rows 3-5 are copies of rows 0-2. So total of 6 rows. So the duplication is vertical. So the process is: for each input row, create two transformed rows, then duplicate the entire transformed matrix once again. Wait, but 3 input rows \u00d7 2 transformed rows each = 6 rows. Then duplicating that would give 12 rows. But in Example 0, the output is 6 rows. So that's not possible. So maybe each input row is transformed into two output rows, and that's it. Then why in Example 0's output, the transformed rows are duplicated? Wait, perhaps the transformation is to take each input row and create two output rows, then mirror the entire transformed matrix. For example, 3 input rows \u2192 6 output rows (each input row becomes two), then arrange them in the order 0,1,2,0,1,2. That would explain Example 0's output. But how does that fit with Example 2's output?\n\nIn Example 2, the input is two rows. Each becomes two output rows. So output has four rows. But the output in Example 2 is:\n\nRow 0: [0,4,0,4]\nRow 1: [0,8,0,8]\nRow 2: [0,4,0,4]\nRow 3: [0,8,0,8]\n\nWhich is rows 0 and 1 followed by 0 and 1 again. So same as Example 0's pattern. So the process seems to be: for each input row, create two output rows (original duplicated and modified duplicated), then mirror the entire transformed matrix. So the total number of output rows is double the input rows. Wait, input rows 3 \u2192 output 6 (3\u00d72). Input rows 6 \u2192 output 12 (6\u00d72). Input rows 2 \u2192 output 4 (2\u00d72). So each input row becomes two output rows, and then the entire transformed matrix is duplicated once. So the total number of output rows is 2\u00d7 the input rows. But in Example 0, the input has 3 rows, output 6 rows. Each input row becomes two output rows. Then, the entire transformed rows are duplicated again. Wait, but 3 input rows \u00d7 2 output rows each = 6 output rows, and then duplicating gives 12. But in Example 0, the output is 6 rows. So that can't be right. So perhaps the duplication is part of the initial transformation. For example, each input row is transformed into two rows, and then those two rows are duplicated. But how?\n\nAlternative approach: look at the output elements and see how they relate to the input.\n\nIn Example 0's input, the first row is [2,0,0]. The first output row is [2,0,8,2,0,8]. So the original elements 2,0,0 are followed by 2,0,8. Wait, no, the output row is longer. Let me split it into parts. The output row has 6 elements, which is double the original 3. So each input element is transformed into two elements. Let's see:\n\nInput row: 2,0,0.\n\nOutput row: 2,0,8, 2,0,8.\n\nSo maybe each element is replaced by a pair. For 2: 2 and 8. For 0: 0 and 0. Then the original row is followed by the transformed row again. Wait, the output row is [2,0,8, 2,0,8]. So it's the transformed pair [2,0,8] followed by [2,0,8]. Wait, but the original row is 3 elements, and each is transformed into two elements, making 6 elements. So 2 becomes 2 and 8, 0 becomes 0 and 0, 0 becomes 0 and 0. Then the transformed row would be [2,0,0, 8,0,0], but that's not the case. Alternatively, maybe the transformation is different. Let's see the elements:\n\nOriginal elements: 2, 0, 0.\n\nIn output row: 2,0,8, 2,0,8.\n\nSo for each original element, perhaps it's followed by 8 if the original is non-zero, else 0. Then the entire row is duplicated. So for 2: 2, 8. For 0: 0,0. Then the transformed row would be [2,8,0,0,0,0], but that's not matching. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the elements are mirrored. The output row [2,0,8, 2,0,8] could be the original row [2,0,0] followed by [2,0,8], but where does the 8 come from? Let's check the other elements. The input matrix in Example 0 has 2s at the corners and 0s elsewhere. The output matrix has 2s and 8s arranged in a pattern. Maybe each non-zero element in the input is replaced by 8 in certain positions. Alternatively, the 8s could be part of a reflection or rotation.\n\nAnother approach: check the position of the original elements in the output matrix. For example, in Example 0's input, the 2 is at (0,0) and (2,2). In the output matrix, the first row starts with 2, then 0, then 8, then 2, etc. So the 2 at (0,0) in input becomes a 2 at position (0,0) in output and another at (0,3). The 8s are in between. Maybe each input element is spread out in the output with 8s inserted. For instance, each element is placed at intervals, and the spaces are filled with 8s.\n\nAlternatively, think of the output as the input matrix being scaled up by a factor of 2 in both dimensions, but with some transformation. For example, each input cell becomes a 2x2 block in the output. For non-zero input cells, their block has the original value and 8s. For zeros, maybe all zeros or 8s. Let's test this.\n\nIn Example 0, the input cell (0,0) is 2. The output's first two rows and first two columns could form a 2x2 block. But looking at the output's first two rows:\n\nRow 0: [2,0,8,2,0,8]\n\nRow 1: [8,0,8,8,0,8]\n\nSo the first two elements of each row are 2 and 0 in row 0, 8 and 0 in row 1. Maybe each input cell becomes a 2x2 block where the top-left is the original value, the rest are 8s if the original is non-zero, else 0.\n\nFor input 2:\n\nThe block would be:\n\n[2, 8]\n\n[8, 8]\n\nFor input 0:\n\n[0,0]\n\n[0,0]\n\nBut let's see. The output of Example 0's first two rows:\n\nFirst input row is [2,0,0].\n\nThe first 2x2 block for 2 would be:\n\nRow 0: 2,8\n\nRow 1:8,8\n\nThen next two elements (for 0) would be 0,0 and 0,0.\n\nWait, but the first row of the output is [2,0,8,2,0,8]. If each element is replaced by a 2x2 block, then the first element 2 would be 2,8 in the first row and 8,8 in the second. But the output row 0 has 2,0,8,2,0,8, which doesn't fit this pattern. So maybe this approach is incorrect.\n\nAnother idea: the output matrix seems to have a pattern where each input row is expanded by inserting 8s and repeating the elements. Let's look at Example 0's output rows again. The first row is [2,0,8,2,0,8]. This looks like the original row [2,0,0] transformed into [2,0,8] and then repeated. So [2,0,8] followed by [2,0,8]. Similarly, the second row is [8,0,8,8,0,8], which is [8,0,8] followed by [8,0,8]. The third row is [8,0,2,8,0,2], which is [8,0,2] followed by [8,0,2]. So each output row is a 3-element sequence repeated twice.\n\nLooking at this, perhaps each input row is transformed into three elements (original elements modified) and then repeated. But how?\n\nFor the first input row [2,0,0], the transformed sequence is [2,0,8], then repeated to form [2,0,8,2,0,8]. Similarly, the second input row [0,0,0] is transformed into [8,0,8], then repeated. The third input row [0,0,2] becomes [8,0,2], repeated.\n\nSo the transformation per element is: for each element in the input row, if it's non-zero, replace it with itself followed by 8. Wait, in the first transformed sequence [2,0,8], the 2 is followed by 0 and 8. But original row is [2,0,0]. Wait, perhaps each element is followed by 8 if it's non-zero, else 0. Then the transformed sequence would be 2,8, 0,0, 0,8. But that doesn't fit. Alternatively, maybe for each element, if it's non-zero, replace it with itself and 8 in the next position. But in the first input row, 2 is followed by 0, then 0. The transformed sequence is [2,0,8]. So maybe the third element (original 0) is replaced by 8. That doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the transformation is adding 8 at the end of each original row, then appending the original row again. But for a row of three elements, adding 8 gives four elements, but the output rows are six elements. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, consider that the output rows are formed by interleaving the original row with a modified version. For example, original row [2,0,0], modified version [2,0,8], then interleaved. But how?\n\nLooking at Example 2's input row [0,4], output row 0 is [0,4,0,4]. So it's the original row followed by the original row again. Then the next row is [0,8,0,8], which is the original row but with 4 replaced by 8, then repeated. So the pattern seems to be:\n\nFor each input row, create two output rows:\n\n- The first output row is the original row concatenated with itself.\n\n- The second output row is the original row with non-zero elements replaced by 8, then concatenated with itself.\n\nThen, after processing all input rows into these two output rows each, the entire transformed matrix is duplicated vertically.\n\nIn Example 0, each input row becomes two output rows. Then the entire transformed matrix is duplicated. So for input rows 3, output rows 3\u00d72 = 6. Then duplicated vertically, but wait, no duplication needed because the output has 6 rows. Wait, in Example 0's output, the rows are:\n\n0: [2,0,8,2,0,8]\n\n1: [8,0,8,8,0,8]\n\n2: [8,0,2,8,0,2]\n\n3: [2,0,8,2,0,8] (same as row 0)\n\n4: same as row 1\n\n5: same as row 2\n\nSo the entire transformed matrix (rows 0-2) is duplicated. So the process is: each input row becomes two output rows (original transformed and modified transformed), then the entire set of rows is duplicated once. So the total number of output rows is 2 \u00d7 the number of input rows \u00d7 2 (since each input row produces two rows and then duplicated). Wait, no. For Example 0:\n\nOriginal input has 3 rows. Each row becomes two output rows. So 3\u00d72=6 rows. Then duplicated, leading to 12 rows. But the output has 6 rows. So this can't be right.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each input row is transformed into two output rows, and these are arranged in a mirrored way. For example, rows 0,1,2 become 0,1,2,0,1,2. So the entire transformed rows are duplicated. That would fit Example 0's output. So the process is:\n\nFor each input row:\n\n- Create two output rows: \n\n   a) Original row transformed by duplicating each element, but replacing non-zero elements with themselves and 8 in some pattern.\n\n   b) Modified row where non-zero elements are replaced by 8.\n\nWait, perhaps for each input row, the first transformed row is the original elements followed by the same elements but with non-zero replaced by 8. Then the second transformed row is the modified elements (non-zero replaced by 8) followed by the original elements.\n\nBut not sure. Let's take Example 0's first input row [2,0,0].\n\nFirst transformed row: [2,0,0, 2,0,0] with non-zero replaced by 8 in the second half. So [2,0,0, 8,0,0]. But the output row is [2,0,8,2,0,8]. Hmm. Alternatively, each element is duplicated, and for the duplicated part, non-zero elements become 8. So:\n\nOriginal element 2 \u2192 2,8.\n\nOriginal element 0 \u2192 0,0.\n\nOriginal element 0 \u2192 0,0.\n\nSo the transformed row would be [2,8, 0,0, 0,0], but the output row is [2,0,8,2,0,8]. That doesn't match.\n\nAlternatively, each element is followed by 8 if it's non-zero, else 0. Then the row is duplicated. For example:\n\nOriginal row [2,0,0] \u2192 transformed into [2,8, 0,0, 0,0]. Then duplicated as [2,8,0,0,0,0, 2,8,0,0,0,0]. But the output row is [2,0,8,2,0,8]. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAnother approach: look at how the 8s are positioned. In Example 0's output, 8s appear where the original zeros were, but not sure. Alternatively, the 8s are in positions that are mirror images of the original non-zero elements.\n\nAlternatively, the output is a combination of the original matrix and a transformed matrix where non-zero elements are replaced by 8, arranged in a certain way. Maybe the original matrix is mirrored or rotated and combined with the transformed matrix.\n\nLooking at Example 0's input:\n\nOriginal matrix:\n\nRow 0: [2,0,0]\n\nRow 1: [0,0,0]\n\nRow 2: [0,0,2]\n\nThe output matrix has 6 rows. The first three rows are:\n\n[2,0,8,2,0,8]\n\n[8,0,8,8,0,8]\n\n[8,0,2,8,0,2]\n\nThen rows 3-5 are the same as rows 0-2.\n\nSo perhaps the output is created by first transforming each input row into a new row, then appending the same transformed rows again. So the vertical duplication.\n\nNow, focusing on the transformed row for the first input row [2,0,0]. The transformed row is [2,0,8,2,0,8]. Let's see how this is constructed. It looks like the original row [2,0,0] is followed by [2,0,8]. So the first three elements are [2,0,0], but in the output row, it's [2,0,8]. Hmm. Or maybe the row is transformed into [2,0,8] and then repeated. So [2,0,8, 2,0,8].\n\nBut why would the third element become 8? The original third element is 0. So perhaps the transformed row's third element is 8 regardless of the input. That doesn't make sense. Alternatively, the 8s are placed at certain positions based on the input's non-zero elements.\n\nLooking at Example 1's input:\n\nInput row 0: [0,5,0,0,0,0]\n\nOutput row 0: [8,5,0,0,0,8,8,5,0,0,0,8]\n\nSo the original row is [0,5,0,0,0,0]. The transformed row starts with 8,5,0,0,0,8 and then repeats. So perhaps for each input element, if it's non-zero, it's kept, and surrounded by 8s. But how?\n\nAlternatively, the output is created by mirroring the input matrix and replacing certain elements with 8s. For example, appending a mirrored version of the row with non-zero elements replaced by 8.\n\nIn Example 0's first input row [2,0,0], the mirrored row would be [0,0,2]. Then combining the original and mirrored, replacing certain elements with 8. So [2,0,0, 0,0,2], but replacing non-zero elements in the mirrored part with 8. That would give [2,0,0, 0,0,8]. But the output row is [2,0,8,2,0,8]. Not matching.\n\nAlternatively, the row is mirrored and then elements are replaced. For example, original row is [2,0,0], mirrored is [0,0,2]. Then combined as [2,0,0, 0,0,2], then replacing the non-zero elements except the first and last with 8. Not sure.\n\nAnother idea: the output matrix is created by taking the input matrix and its transpose, then combining them with 8s. But not sure.\n\nLooking at Example 2's input:\n\nInput:\n\n[0,4]\n\n[0,0]\n\nOutput:\n\n[0,4,0,4]\n\n[0,8,0,8]\n\n[0,4,0,4]\n\n[0,8,0,8]\n\nSo each input row becomes two output rows. The first output row for [0,4] is [0,4,0,4], which is the original row duplicated. The second output row is [0,8,0,8], which is the original row with non-zero elements replaced by 8, then duplicated. Then these two rows are repeated again. So the pattern is: for each input row, generate two output rows (original duplicated and modified duplicated), then duplicate those two rows again.\n\nSo the process is:\n\nFor each input row:\n\n1. Generate a row that is the input row concatenated with itself.\n\n2. Generate a row that is the input row with non-zero elements replaced by 8, then concatenated with itself.\n\nThen, the entire transformed matrix (after processing all input rows) is duplicated vertically. So each input row contributes two output rows, and then all those rows are duplicated again, leading to 4 output rows per input row. Wait, but in Example 2, each input row contributes two output rows, and then those are duplicated once, leading to four rows. So for an input of two rows, output is four rows. Then duplicated again to make eight rows. But the output in Example 2 is four rows. So this suggests that each input row is transformed into two output rows, and the entire transformed matrix is not duplicated further. But Example 0's output is six rows, which is 3 input rows \u00d7 2 output rows each. But in Example 0's output, those six rows are the transformed rows followed by themselves again. So perhaps the duplication is part of the transformation.\n\nWait, maybe the transformation is:\n\nEach input row is transformed into two output rows:\n\n- The first output row is the original row followed by the original row, but with non-zero elements replaced by 8.\n\n- The second output row is the original row with non-zero elements replaced by 8, followed by the same modified row.\n\nBut this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, for each input element, if it's non-zero, it's replaced by a sequence of [value, 8], and if zero, replaced by [0,0]. Then each row is doubled in length, and each row is duplicated twice.\n\nWait, let's test this with Example 0's first row:\n\nInput row [2,0,0]. Each element becomes:\n\n2 \u2192 [2,8]\n\n0 \u2192 [0,0]\n\n0 \u2192 [0,0]\n\nSo transformed row would be [2,8,0,0,0,0]. Then duplicated, leading to [2,8,0,0,0,0, 2,8,0,0,0,0]. But the actual output row is [2,0,8,2,0,8]. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAnother approach: look for the number of 8s and their positions. In Example 0's output, the 8s are in positions where the original zeros were, but that's not the case. Alternatively, 8s are placed in positions that are symmetric to the original non-zero elements. For example, in the input, 2 is at (0,0) and (2,2). In the output, 8s are around these positions.\n\nAlternatively, the output matrix is the Kronecker product of the input matrix with a certain pattern. For example, each element is replaced by a 2x2 matrix. For non-zero elements, the pattern is [[a, b], [c, d]], and for zeros, another pattern. Let's see.\n\nIn Example 0's input, the 2's could be replaced by:\n\n[[2, 8], [8, 8]]\n\nAnd zeros by:\n\n[[0, 0], [0, 0]]\n\nThen the Kronecker product would expand each element into a 2x2 block. So the input matrix 3x3 becomes 6x6.\n\nBut let's see. For the first input row [2,0,0]:\n\nThe Kronecker product would produce:\n\n[2,8,0,0,0,0]\n\n[8,8,0,0,0,0]\n\nThen the next two elements are 0,0 \u2192 expanded to four zeros each.\n\nBut the output row 0 is [2,0,8,2,0,8], which doesn't fit. So this might not be correct.\n\nAlternatively, the pattern for non-zero elements is a 2x2 block where the first row is [value, 8] and the second row is [8,8]. But again, this doesn't align with the output rows.\n\nHmm. This is challenging. Let's try to find another angle. Let's look at the positions of the original non-zero elements in the output.\n\nIn Example 0's input, the 2s are at (0,0) and (2,2). In the output, the first row has 2 at positions 0 and 3. The third row has 2 at position 5 (but not sure). In Example 1's input, the 5s are at (0,1) and (4,0), (4,5). In the output, the 5s are at positions (0,1), (0,7), (4,0), (4,6), (4,11), etc. So each original non-zero element is placed at intervals of 6 columns. For example, in Example 0's output rows, the 2s are every 3 elements apart, which suggests that the original matrix is being expanded with a certain pattern.\n\nWait, Example 0's input is 3x3, output 6x6. So each input row becomes two output rows, and each input column becomes two output columns. So each input cell is represented in a 2x2 block. For non-zero cells, the block could be:\n\n[original, 8]\n\n[8, 8]\n\nAnd for zero cells:\n\n[0, 0]\n\n[0, 0]\n\nLet's test this. For input cell 2:\n\nBlock becomes:\n\nRow 0: 2, 8\n\nRow 1: 8, 8\n\nFor input cell 0:\n\nBlock becomes:\n\nRow 0: 0,0\n\nRow 1:0,0\n\nSo applying this to Example 0's first row [2,0,0], the first output rows would be:\n\nRow 0: 2,8 | 0,0 | 0,0 \u2192 concatenated as [2,8,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow 1:8,8 |0,0 |0,0 \u2192 [8,8,0,0,0,0]\n\nBut the actual output rows for Example 0 are:\n\nRow 0: [2,0,8,2,0,8]\n\nRow 1: [8,0,8,8,0,8]\n\nThis doesn't match. So perhaps the expansion is different. Alternatively, each input cell is expanded into a 2x2 block where the first element is the original value, and the rest are 8s if non-zero, else 0.\n\nSo for input cell 2:\n\nBlock:\n\n[2, 8]\n\n[8, 8]\n\nFor input cell 0:\n\n[0,0]\n\n[0,0]\n\nSo for input row [2,0,0], the first output row would be 2,8,0,0,0,0 and the second row would be 8,8,0,0,0,0. But the actual output rows are different. So this doesn't fit.\n\nMaybe there's a different pattern. Let's think about the output as the input matrix being surrounded by 8s in some way. For example, each input element is placed in the output matrix with 8s around it. But how?\n\nAlternatively, the output matrix is formed by tiling the input matrix and replacing certain elements with 8s. For example, the input matrix is repeated in a larger grid, and 8s are added between them. But I'm not sure.\n\nAnother idea: in Example 0's output, each row seems to alternate between the original elements and 8s. For example, the first row is [2,0,8,2,0,8]. So it's like the original row [2,0,0] interleaved with [2,0,0] where non-zero elements are replaced by 8. So the pattern is original element followed by 8 if non-zero, else 0. Then the entire row is duplicated.\n\nSo for input element 2: 2 followed by 8.\n\nFor 0: 0 followed by 0.\n\nSo transforming [2,0,0] into [2,8, 0,0, 0,0], then duplicated to make [2,8,0,0,0,0, 2,8,0,0,0,0]. But the output row is [2,0,8,2,0,8], which doesn't match.\n\nAlternatively, the transformation is original element followed by 8, then the original row again. So [2,0,0] becomes [2,0,0, 2,8,8]. But that doesn't fit either.\n\nHmm. Let's try to find a pattern in the outputs.\n\nIn Example 0's output:\n\nRow 0: [2,0,8,2,0,8]\n\nRow 1: [8,0,8,8,0,8]\n\nRow 2: [8,0,2,8,0,2]\n\nRows 3-5 are duplicates of 0-2.\n\nNotice that the 8s are placed in positions where the input had zeros. For example, in row 0, the third element is 8, which was a zero in the original. But the original input's first row had 2,0,0. So perhaps each zero in the input is replaced by 8 in certain positions in the output.\n\nAlternatively, the output is generated by taking the input matrix and expanding each row and column into two, inserting 8s in the new positions. For example, insert 8 between each element and after. But not sure.\n\nAnother approach: the output matrix is a combination of the input matrix and its mirror image, with 8s added. For example, each row is followed by its mirror image, with 8s replacing certain elements.\n\nFor Example 0's first input row [2,0,0], the mirror image would be [0,0,2]. Combining with the original row gives [2,0,0,0,0,2], then replacing certain elements with 8. But the output row is [2,0,8,2,0,8]. Not matching.\n\nAlternatively, the output row is the original row followed by the mirror of the original row, but with non-zero elements replaced by 8. For Example 0's first row, mirror is [0,0,2], replace non-zero with 8: [0,0,8]. So combined row is [2,0,0, 0,0,8]. But output row is [2,0,8,2,0,8]. Not matching.\n\nThis is getting frustrating. Let's look for another pattern. In Example 2's input row [0,4], the first output row is [0,4,0,4], which is the original row followed by itself. The second output row is [0,8,0,8], which is the original row with 4 replaced by 8, then followed by the same. So the pattern here seems to be: for each input row, create two output rows: one where non-zero elements are kept, and another where non-zero elements are replaced by 8, then each of these rows is the original row duplicated.\n\nThen, after processing all input rows, the entire output matrix is duplicated vertically. So each input row contributes two output rows, and then the entire output matrix is duplicated again.\n\nIn Example 0's case, the input rows are processed into two output rows each, then those six rows are duplicated, making 12 rows. But the output has six rows. So perhaps the duplication is not vertical but horizontal. Or maybe the output is constructed by horizontally concatenating the transformed row and its modified version.\n\nWait, for Example 0's first input row [2,0,0], the output row is [2,0,8,2,0,8]. This looks like the original row [2,0,0] followed by a modified version [2,0,8], where the last element is replaced by 8. But why the last element?\n\nAlternatively, the modified version is the original row with the first non-zero element replaced by 8. But not sure.\n\nLet's try to find a pattern between input and output for individual elements.\n\nIn Example 0's input, the non-zero elements are 2 and 2. In the output, the 2s appear at the start and end of certain rows, and 8s are in between. For Example 0's first output row, the elements are 2,0,8,2,0,8. The 2s are in positions 0 and 3, which are the same positions as the original row (0,0) and then 0,3 (which would be the original position scaled by 2).\n\nAh! Wait, perhaps the output is created by scaling the input matrix by a factor of 2, so each cell is represented by a 2x2 block. For non-zero elements, the block is [value, 8; 8, 8], and for zero elements, it's [0,0; 0,0]. Then, the matrix is scaled in both dimensions.\n\nSo for Example 0's first row [2,0,0], each element becomes a 2x2 block:\n\n- 2 \u2192 [[2,8],[8,8]]\n\n- 0 \u2192 [[0,0],[0,0]]\n\nSo the first row would be:\n\nRow 0: 2,8 | 0,0 | 0,0 \u2192 [2,8,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow 1: 8,8 | 0,0 | 0,0 \u2192 [8,8,0,0,0,0]\n\nBut the actual output rows are:\n\nRow 0: [2,0,8,2,0,8]\n\nRow 1: [8,0,8,8,0,8]\n\nThis doesn't match. So maybe this approach is wrong.\n\nAlternatively, the scaling is different. Each element becomes a 2x3 block. But this seems too arbitrary.\n\nAnother thought: perhaps the output matrix is a combination of the input matrix and its transpose, with 8s filling the off-diagonal elements. But not sure.\n\nAlternatively, think of the output matrix as having the input matrix in the top-left and bottom-right corners, with 8s in between. For Example 0's input 3x3 matrix, the output 6x6 matrix could have the input matrix in positions (0,0), (0,3), (3,0), (3,3). The other positions filled with 8s. But let's check:\n\nIf the input matrix is placed at (0,0) and (3,3), then the first row of output would be [2,0,0, 8,8,8], which doesn't match the output.\n\nAlternatively, the input matrix is duplicated in the output, with 8s in between. For Example 0's first row, input is [2,0,0]. Output row is [2,0,8,2,0,8]. So it's the input row, followed by the input row again, but with the last element replaced by 8. So [2,0,0] + [2,0,8] = [2,0,0,2,0,8]. But the actual output row is [2,0,8,2,0,8]. So maybe the input row is interleaved with a modified version where non-zero elements are replaced by 8.\n\nFor example, each input row is interleaved with a modified row where non-zero elements are 8. So for the first input row [2,0,0], modified row is [8,0,8]. Then interleaving gives [2,8, 0,0, 0,8]. Which would be [2,8,0,0,0,8], but the output row is [2,0,8,2,0,8]. Doesn't match.\n\nAnother approach: the output for each input row is created by taking the original row and appending a modified version where each non-zero element is replaced by 8. For Example 0's first row:\n\nOriginal: [2,0,0]\n\nModified: [8,0,8]\n\nAppended together: [2,0,0,8,0,8]. But the output row is [2,0,8,2,0,8]. So this is different. So perhaps the modified version is replacing the original non-zero elements with 8, but keeping the positions. Then the output row is the original row followed by the modified row. But Example 0's first output row is [2,0,8,2,0,8], which would be [2,0,0, 2,0,8]. But this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, the output row is the original row followed by the original row with non-zero elements replaced by 8, but mirrored. So for [2,0,0], mirrored is [0,0,2], replaced by [0,0,8]. Then appended to the original: [2,0,0,0,0,8]. But the output row is [2,0,8,2,0,8]. Not matching.\n\nThis is really challenging. Let's try to look for a pattern in the output rows.\n\nIn Example 0's output, each row seems to have a 2 and an 8 at the beginning and end. For example, row 0: 2,0,8,2,0,8. So it's like 2 followed by 0 and 8, then repeated. The same pattern in the middle. So the row is split into two halves, each half being [2,0,8] and [2,0,8]. So the entire row is two copies of [2,0,8].\n\nBut the original row is [2,0,0]. So how does [2,0,0] become [2,0,8]? The third element is changed from 0 to 8. So perhaps each input row is transformed into a new row where the last element is replaced by 8 if there's a non-zero element in the input matrix.\n\nAlternatively, the output rows are formed by appending the original row with a modified row where the non-zero elements are replaced by 8. For Example 0's first input row:\n\nOriginal row: [2,0,0]\n\nModified row: [8,0,8]\n\nAppended: [2,0,0,8,0,8]. But the output row is [2,0,8,2,0,8]. So it's different. The third element in the original is 0, but in the output, it's 8. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, the transformation involves adding 8s at certain positions based on the input's non-zero elements. For example, if a row has a non-zero element at position i, then in the output row, the corresponding position in the mirrored part is 8.\n\nIn Example 0's first row, the non-zero element is at position 0. So in the mirrored part (positions 3-5), position 3 would be 2 (original), position 5 would be 8. So the output row is [2,0,0,2,0,8]. But the actual output row is [2,0,8,2,0,8]. So the third element is 8, which might be related to the original third element being 0. Not sure.\n\nAnother idea: the output matrix is constructed by horizontally concatenating the input matrix and a transformed matrix where non-zero elements are replaced by 8. Then vertically concatenating the same matrices.\n\nFor example, input matrix:\n\nRow 0: [2,0,0]\n\nRow 1: [0,0,0]\n\nRow 2: [0,0,2]\n\nTransformed matrix (non-zero replaced by 8):\n\nRow 0: [8,0,0]\n\nRow 1: [0,0,0]\n\nRow 2: [0,0,8]\n\nThen, horizontally concatenate input and transformed matrices, then vertically concatenate the same.\n\nBut the output matrix would be:\n\n[2,0,0,8,0,0]\n\n[0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\n[0,0,2,0,0,8]\n\n[2,0,0,8,0,0]\n\n[0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\n[0,0,2,0,0,8]\n\nWhich doesn't match Example 0's output.\n\nAlternatively, the transformed matrix is rotated or mirrored.\n\nHmm. I'm stuck. Let's try to think of another approach. Maybe the output matrix is generated by applying a specific mathematical operation. For example, each element is multiplied by 4 to get 8 (since 2 becomes 8 in Example 0's output). Wait, 2 \u00d74=8. But then 5 in Example 1's input remains 5 in the output. So that's not it. But maybe non-zero elements are replaced by 8, except for certain positions.\n\nIn Example 1's output, the 5s are present in certain rows, like row 0 and row 6. So maybe the original elements are preserved in even rows and replaced by 8 in odd rows. For example, in Example 2's output:\n\nRow 0: [0,4,0,4] (original elements)\n\nRow 1: [0,8,0,8] (replaced)\n\nRow 2: [0,4,0,4]\n\nRow 3: [0,8,0,8]\n\nSo the pattern is even rows keep the original elements, odd rows replace non-zero with 8. And each input row generates two output rows (original and modified), and then the entire transformed matrix is duplicated vertically. So each input row's two output rows are duplicated once, leading to four output rows per input row. But in Example 0's case, each input row generates two output rows, leading to 6 rows, which are duplicated once to make 12 rows. But the output in Example 0 has 6 rows. So this can't be.\n\nWait, in Example 0's output, each input row generates two output rows, but they are not duplicated. The output rows are generated as two per input row, and then the entire set of output rows is duplicated. So for Example 0, 3 input rows \u2192 6 output rows (two per input row), then duplicated to make 12. But the output has 6 rows. So this contradicts.\n\nBut looking back at Example 0's output, it's 6 rows, which is exactly two per input row. So perhaps the duplication isn't part of the pattern. So each input row becomes two output rows: one with the original elements duplicated, and one with non-zero elements replaced by 8 and then duplicated.\n\nIn Example 0's first input row [2,0,0], the two output rows are:\n\nRow 0: [2,0,8,2,0,8]\n\nRow 1: [8,0,8,8,0,8]\n\nWait, how to get these?\n\nIf the first row is created by duplicating the original row, but replacing the third element with 8 each time. So [2,0,8] repeated twice gives [2,0,8,2,0,8]. Similarly, the second row is [8,0,8] repeated twice. But why the third element?\n\nAlternatively, the output rows are generated by taking the original row and its reverse, replacing non-zero elements with 8 in the reverse part.\n\nFor example, original row [2,0,0], reverse is [0,0,2]. Replace non-zero elements in reverse with 8: [0,0,8]. Then concatenate original and modified reverse: [2,0,0,0,0,8]. But this doesn't match the output row.\n\nAlternatively, the output rows are generated by placing the original row and a transformed row where each non-zero element is replaced by 8, but the entire row is mirrored.\n\nBut I'm not making progress. Let's try to summarize the patterns:\n\nFor each input row, the output has two rows. The first output row seems to be the original row elements followed by themselves but with some modification. The second output row is a modified version of the original row followed by the same modification.\n\nThe modification seems to replace certain elements with 8. It looks like, in the first output row of each input row, the third element is replaced by 8. For example, in Example 0's first input row [2,0,0], the first output row is [2,0,8,2,0,8]. So the third and sixth elements are 8. Similarly, in Example 2's first input row [0,4], the first output row is [0,4,0,4], which duplicates the elements. The second output row is [0,8,0,8], which replaces the 4 with 8.\n\nSo the pattern seems to be: for each input row, create two output rows. The first output row is the original row concatenated with itself. The second output row is the original row with non-zero elements replaced by 8, then concatenated with itself. Then, each input row's two output rows are duplicated once vertically, leading to four output rows per input row. But in Example 0's case, each input row's two output rows are duplicated vertically, leading to six rows (3 input rows \u00d7 2 output rows each, then duplicated once to get 6 rows). But Example 0's output has six rows, which is exactly two per input row. So perhaps the duplication isn't vertical but horizontal.\n\nAlternatively, the output matrix is constructed by applying the following steps for each input row:\n\n1. Create two versions of the row:\n\n   a) Original row, duplicated horizontally (so each element is followed by itself).\n\n   b) Original row with non-zero elements replaced by 8, then duplicated horizontally.\n\n2. Stack these two versions vertically for each input row.\n\nThen, after processing all input rows, the entire matrix is duplicated vertically again.\n\nBut in Example 0's case, this would result in 3 input rows \u00d7 2 output rows = 6 output rows, which matches the example. Then, the output is not duplicated again. But in Example 2, it's 2 input rows \u00d7 2 output rows = 4 output rows, which matches the example.\n\nSo let's test this hypothesis.\n\nFor Example 2's input row [0,4]:\n\nVersion a: [0,4,0,4] (original duplicated).\n\nVersion b: [0,8,0,8] (non-zero replaced by 8, then duplicated).\n\nThen, these two rows are stacked. The entire output matrix for Example 2 is:\n\nRow 0: [0,4,0,4]\n\nRow 1: [0,8,0,8]\n\nRow 2: [0,0,0,0] (from input row [0,0], version a)\n\nRow 3: [0,0,0,0] (from input row [0,0], version b)\n\nBut the actual output of Example 2 is:\n\n[0,4,0,4]\n\n[0,8,0,8]\n\n[0,4,0,4]\n\n[0,8,0,8]\n\nWhich suggests that the second input row [0,0] is transformed into two rows: [0,0,0,0] and [0,0,0,0]. But in the actual output, these rows are [0,4,0,4] and [0,8,0,8] again. So this contradicts.\n\nHmm. So maybe the entire matrix is transformed in a different way. It's possible that after processing each input row into two output rows, the entire set of output rows is duplicated vertically. For example:\n\nExample 2's input has two rows:\n\nRow 0: [0,4] \u2192 transformed into [0,4,0,4] and [0,8,0,8]\n\nRow 1: [0,0] \u2192 transformed into [0,0,0,0] and [0,0,0,0]\n\nSo the output matrix would have four rows:\n\nRow 0: [0,4,0,4]\n\nRow 1: [0,8,0,8]\n\nRow 2: [0,0,0,0]\n\nRow 3: [0,0,0,0]\n\nBut the actual output is four rows:\n\nRow 0: [0,4,0,4]\n\nRow 1: [0,8,0,8]\n\nRow 2: [0,4,0,4]\n\nRow 3: [0,8,0,8]\n\nThis suggests that after processing all input rows into two output rows each, the entire set of output rows is duplicated again. But how?\n\nIn Example 2's case, the four output rows would be the transformed rows duplicated. So it's like each input row's two output rows are duplicated again. For example, row 0's two output rows are duplicated, leading to four rows. But this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, the entire transformed matrix is duplicated vertically. So after processing the input into two output rows per input row, the entire matrix is stacked again. So for Example 0's 3 input rows \u2192 6 output rows, which is the case. For Example 2's 2 input rows \u2192 4 output rows, but the example shows four rows, which matches.\n\nWait, but Example 2's output has four rows, which is exactly two per input row. So perhaps there's no duplication. But the output rows in Example 2 are duplicates of the first two rows. So perhaps the second input row [0,0] is transformed into two output rows [0,0,0,0] and [0,0,0,0], but in the actual example, the third and fourth rows are duplicates of the first and second. So this suggests that the input matrix is processed such that each input row is transformed into two output rows, and then the same two rows are repeated again. But why would that happen?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the input matrix is mirrored vertically before processing. For example, in Example 2's input:\n\nOriginal input:\n\nRow 0: [0,4]\n\nRow 1: [0,0]\n\nMirroring vertically gives:\n\nRow 0: [0,4]\n\nRow 1: [0,0]\n\nRow 2: [0,0]\n\nRow 3: [0,4]\n\nThen each of these four rows is transformed into two output rows. But this doesn't fit.\n\nThis is getting too time-consuming. Let's try to formulate a rule based on the examples:\n\nFor each input row, generate two output rows:\n\n1. The first output row is the original row followed by the original row, but with non-zero elements replaced by 8.\n\n2. The second output row is the original row with non-zero elements replaced by 8, followed by the same modified row.\n\nThen, vertically stack these rows.\n\nLet's test this with Example 0's first input row [2,0,0].\n\nFirst output row: [2,0,0] + [2,0,8] \u2192 [2,0,0,2,0,8]\n\nSecond output row: [8,0,8] + [8,0,8] \u2192 [8,0,8,8,0,8]\n\nBut the actual output rows for Example 0's first input row are:\n\nRow 0: [2,0,8,2,0,8]\n\nRow 1: [8,0,8,8,0,8]\n\nSo this doesn't match. The first output row would be [2,0,0,2,0,8], but the actual row is [2,0,8,2,0,8]. So the third element is 8 instead of 0. So perhaps the first output row is the original row followed by the modified row (non-zero replaced by 8). For [2,0,0], modified row is [8,0,8]. So the first output row is [2,0,0,8,0,8]. But the actual output row is [2,0,8,2,0,8]. Not matching.\n\nAlternatively, the first output row is the original row interleaved with the modified row. For example, for each element, take the original followed by the modified. For [2,0,0] and modified [8,0,8], interleaving gives [2,8, 0,0, 0,8], which is [2,8,0,0,0,8]. But the output row is [2,0,8,2,0,8]. Doesn't match.\n\nAnother approach: perhaps the output matrix is created by doubling each row and column. Each element in the input is replaced by a 2x2 block. For non-zero elements, the block is [[v, 8], [8, v]]. For zeros, the block is [[0,0],[0,0]]. Let's test this for Example 0's 2:\n\nBlock for 2 would be:\n\n2 8\n\n8 2\n\nSo the first two rows of the output for the first input row [2,0,0] would be:\n\nRow 0: 2,8 | 0,0 | 0,0 \u2192 [2,8,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow 1: 8,2 | 0,0 | 0,0 \u2192 [8,2,0,0,0,0]\n\nBut the actual first two rows of Example 0's output are [2,0,8,2,0,8] and [8,0,8,8,0,8], which don't match. So this is incorrect.\n\nI think I'm stuck here. Given the time I've spent and not finding a clear pattern, perhaps I should look for a different angle. Let's consider the number of elements in the output rows. For Example 0's input row of 3 elements, the output row has 6 elements. Example 2's input row of 2 elements becomes 4. So the output rows are double the length of the input rows. So each element is transformed into two elements. For non-zero elements, perhaps the two elements are the original and 8. For zeros, two zeros. Then the row is followed by itself again.\n\nFor example, input row [2,0,0] becomes:\n\nEach element replaced by two elements:\n\n2 \u2192 [2, 8]\n\n0 \u2192 [0, 0]\n\n0 \u2192 [0, 0]\n\nSo transformed row is [2,8,0,0,0,0]. Then duplicated to get [2,8,0,0,0,0,2,8,0,0,0,0]. But this is longer than the output row. Wait, the output rows in Example 0 are 6 elements, so this approach can't be right.\n\nAlternative idea: the output rows are formed by taking each element and appending 8 if non-zero, else 0. Then the entire row is duplicated. For example, input row [2,0,0] becomes [2,8,0,0,0,0], then duplicated to [2,8,0,0,0,0,2,8,0,0,0,0], which is 12 elements. Not matching.\n\nHmm. Given the time I've invested and not finding a clear pattern, I'll have to make an educated guess based on the examples.\n\nFrom Example 2, each input row is transformed into two output rows: the original duplicated and the original with non-zero elements replaced by 8, duplicated. Then these two rows are repeated again. So each input row contributes four output rows. But Example 2's output has four rows for two input rows, which would be two output rows per input row. So this contradicts.\n\nAlternatively, each input row is transformed into two output rows, and the entire transformed matrix is vertically stacked twice. So for Example 0's 3 rows, transformed into 6 rows, then stacked twice to get 12 rows. But the example shows 6 rows. So this is not possible.\n\nAnother observation: in Example 0's output, the 2s appear in the first and fourth positions of the first row. The input was a 3x3 matrix, so the output is a 6x6 matrix. Perhaps each input element is placed at positions (i*2, j*2) in the output, and the surrounding elements are filled with 8s. For example, input element at (0,0) becomes output elements at (0,0) and (0,1) as 2 and 8, but not sure.\n\nAlternatively, each input element is placed at (i, j) in the output, and the surrounding elements are filled with 8s. For example, each input element is part of a 2x2 block in the output. For non-zero elements, the block is [original, 8; 8, 8]. For zeros, the block is [0,0; 0,0].\n\nBut in Example 0's first input row, the first element is 2. The output's first two rows and first two columns would be:\n\nRow 0: 2, 8\n\nRow 1: 8, 8\n\nThen the next two elements (originally 0) would be:\n\nRow 0: 0, 0\n\nRow 1: 0, 0\n\nSo the first output row would be [2,8,0,0,0,0], but the actual output row is [2,0,8,2,0,8]. So this doesn't fit.\n\nI think I've exhausted all possible approaches I can think of. Given the time, I'll proceed to make a guess based on the examples.\n\nThe pattern seems to be:\n\nEach input row is transformed into two output rows:\n\n- The first output row is the original row concatenated with a modified version where non-zero elements are replaced by 8.\n\n- The second output row is the modified row (non-zero elements replaced by 8) concatenated with the original row.\n\nThen, the entire set of output rows is duplicated vertically.\n\nFor Example 0's first input row [2,0,0]:\n\nFirst output row: [2,0,0, 8,0,0] \u2192 but actual output row is [2,0,8,2,0,8]. Doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, the modified row is [2,0,8], so concatenated with original: [2,0,0, 2,0,8]. Still not matching.\n\nGiven the time constraints, I'll proceed to the test input and try to apply a pattern based on Example 2 and Example 0.\n\nTest input:\n\n[0,0,3,0]\n\n[0,0,0,0]\n\n[0,0,0,3]\n\n[3,0,0,0]\n\nEach input row should be transformed into two output rows. For each element in the input row:\n\n- If non-zero, in the first output row, duplicate the element and replace the copy with 8.\n\n- If zero, keep as 0 in both positions.\n\nThen concatenate the row with itself.\n\nAlternatively, for each input row, create two output rows:\n\n1. Original row followed by original row with non-zero elements replaced by 8.\n\n2. Modified row (non-zero replaced by 8) followed by the modified row.\n\nBut how to get the output rows like in the examples.\n\nFor the test input's first row [0,0,3,0], the first output row would be [0,0,3,0] concatenated with [0,0,8,0], giving [0,0,3,0,0,0,8,0]. But the output rows in the examples have double the elements, so for an input row of 4 elements, the output row would have 8 elements. But the examples show that the output row length is double the input row length. For example, Example 0's input row of 3 elements becomes 6 elements.\n\nSo for each input element, generate two elements: the original and 8 if non-zero, else 0 and 0.\n\nFor example, input element 3 becomes [3,8], 0 becomes [0,0].\n\nSo for the first row [0,0,3,0], the transformed row would be [0,0,0,0,3,8,0,0]. Then duplicated to get [0,0,0,0,3,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,8,0,0]. But this is longer than necessary. Alternatively, the transformed row is [0,0,3,8,0,0] for the first part, then duplicated to get [0,0,3,8,0,0,0,0,3,8,0,0].\n\nBut this is not matching the examples.\n\nAlternatively, the output row is the original elements followed by the same elements but with non-zero replaced by 8. For example:\n\nInput row [0,0,3,0] becomes [0,0,3,0,0,0,8,0]. But each output row in the examples has double the length of the input row. So this fits.\n\nThen the first output row for the test input's first row would be [0,0,3,0,0,0,8,0], but looking at Example 0's output, the pattern seems to be to have the original elements followed by the same elements but with non-zero elements replaced by 8, and perhaps also other modifications.\n\nBut I'm not sure. Given the time, I'll proceed to apply the pattern I observed in Example 2 and Example 0:\n\nEach input row is transformed into two output rows:\n\n- The first output row is the original row followed by itself, with non-zero elements replaced by 8.\n\n- The second output row is the original row with non-zero elements replaced by 8, followed by the same modified row.\n\nThen, the entire set of output rows is duplicated vertically.\n\nApplying this to the test input:\n\nTest input has four rows:\n\nRow 0: [0,0,3,0]\n\nRow 1: [0,0,0,0]\n\nRow 2: [0,0,0,3]\n\nRow 3: [3,0,0,0]\n\nFor each row:\n\nRow 0:\n\nFirst output row: [0,0,3,0] + [0,0,8,0] \u2192 [0,0,3,0,0,0,8,0]\n\nSecond output row: [0,0,8,0] + [0,0,8,0] \u2192 [0,0,8,0,0,0,8,0]\n\nBut the output rows in the examples have even more elements, so perhaps each element is duplicated and then replaced. Alternatively, each input row is transformed into two output rows where each element is duplicated, and non-zero elements are replaced by 8 in the second part.\n\nFor example, input row [0,0,3,0] becomes:\n\nFirst output row: [0,0,3,0,0,0,3,0]\n\nSecond output row: [0,0,8,0,0,0,8,0]\n\nBut this doesn't match the examples.\n\nAlternatively, each element is duplicated, and in the second output row, non-zero elements are replaced by 8.\n\nFor example, input row [0,0,3,0]:\n\nFirst output row: [0,0,3,3,0,0,0,0]\n\nSecond output row: [0,0,8,8,0,0,0,0]\n\nBut this is just a guess.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and the need to provide an answer, I'll proceed with the pattern observed in Example 2 and Example 0, where each input row is transformed into two output rows:\n\n- The first output row is the original row concatenated with itself, with non-zero elements replaced by 8.\n\n- The second output row is the modified row (non-zero to 8) concatenated with itself.\n\nThen, the entire output matrix is duplicated vertically.\n\nApplying this to the test input:\n\nFor row 0: [0,0,3,0]\n\nFirst output row: [0,0,3,0, 0,0,8,0]\n\nSecond output row: [0,0,8,0, 0,0,8,0]\n\nRow 1: [0,0,0,0]\n\nFirst output row: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nSecond output row: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow 2: [0,0,0,3]\n\nFirst output row: [0,0,0,3, 0,0,0,8]\n\nSecond output row: [0,0,0,8, 0,0,0,8]\n\nRow 3: [3,0,0,0]\n\nFirst output row: [3,0,0,0,8,0,0,0]\n\nSecond output row: [8,0,0,0,8,0,0,0]\n\nThen, the entire output matrix is duplicated vertically. So the four rows become eight. But the test input's output should have rows equal to 2x the number of input rows. Since the test input has four rows, the output should have eight rows. However, in the training examples, the output rows are twice the input rows. For example, Example 0 has 3 input rows \u2192 6 output rows. Example 1 has 6 input rows \u2192 12 output rows. Example 2 has 2 input rows \u2192 4 output rows.\n\nSo for the test input with four rows, the output should have eight rows. Each input row generates two output rows. Thus, the output for the test input would be eight rows, each of double the length of the input rows (from 4 to 8 elements).\n\nBut looking at the test input, each row has four elements, so each output row would have eight elements.\n\nSo applying the pattern:\n\nFor each input row, two output rows:\n\nRow 0: [0,0,3,0,0,0,8,0]\n\nRow 1: [0,0,8,0,0,0,8,0]\n\nRow 2: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow 3: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow 4: [0,0,0,3,0,0,0,8]\n\nRow 5: [0,0,0,8,0,0,0,8]\n\nRow 6: [3,0,0,0,8,0,0,0]\n\nRow 7: [8,0,0,0,8,0,0,0]\n\nBut looking at the training examples, the output rows often have repeating patterns. For example, in Example 0's output, the first row is [2,0,8,2,0,8], which is [2,0,8] repeated twice. Similarly, in the test input's case, perhaps each output row is the transformed row followed by itself again. For example, for row 0 of the test input:\n\nOriginal row [0,0,3,0] transformed into [0,0,3,8] and then repeated to make [0,0,3,8,0,0,3,8].\n\nBut I'm not confident. Given the time constraints, I'll proceed to format the answer based on the pattern observed in Example 0 and Example 2, where each input element is followed by 8 if non-zero, and the row is duplicated, leading to the output rows as in the examples."
