        "cot_1": "Okay, let's see. I need to figure out the pattern from the training examples to apply to the test input. Let me start by analyzing each example one by one.\n\nLooking at Example 0. The input has several rows of numbers. The output is the last three rows of the input. Wait, no. Let me check. The input in Example 0 is:\n\n[6,0,6]\n[0,6,6]\n[6,0,6]\n[4,0,4]\n[0,4,4]\n[4,0,4]\n[8,8,8]\n[8,0,8]\n[8,8,8]\n\nAnd the output is the last three rows of the input. So the output is the 7th, 8th, 9th rows (assuming 0-indexing). But maybe there's another pattern here. Maybe the output is the group of three rows that has a certain structure. Let's check the structure of the output rows. The output here is three rows: first all 8s, then middle 0, then all 8s again. So maybe it's looking for a triplet where the middle element is 0 and the others are the same. Wait, but the output rows are [8,8,8], [8,0,8], [8,8,8]. Hmm, that's like a diamond shape with 0 in the middle. Or maybe it's the group that has a palindrome structure. Let's see other examples.\n\nExample 1's input is a list of longer arrays. The output is three rows: [7,0,7], [0,7,0], [7,0,7]. Looking at the input, those rows are present in the input. For instance, the first row of the input is [2,0,0,3,0,0,7,0,7,1,0,0]. So maybe the output is taking the part of the input where there's a triplet of rows that form a certain pattern. Wait, but the output in Example 1 is three rows of varying lengths. Wait no, the input arrays in Example 1 are of length 12. The output arrays are of length 3. So perhaps the input is a set of multiple triplets concatenated, and the output is the triplet that follows a certain pattern. For example, in the input, the 7,0,7 appears in positions 6-8 of the first row. Then the next row has 0,7,0. Then the third row has 7,0,7 again. So the output is those three rows. So maybe the pattern is that the output is the set of three consecutive rows that form a symmetric pattern where the middle row has 0 in the middle and the surrounding rows have the same number on the ends and 0 in the middle, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, looking at Example 0's output, the three rows are [8,8,8], [8,0,8], [8,8,8]. So each row is 8s except the middle one has a 0 in the middle. So this looks like a diamond or a cross shape. Similarly, Example 1's output is [7,0,7], [0,7,0], [7,0,7], which is a similar pattern but with 7s. So maybe the pattern is that the output is the group of three rows that form this specific structure: top and bottom rows have the same non-zero number on the ends and zeros in the middle (or maybe not?), and the middle row has the number in the middle. Wait, no. Let me think again. The structure is:\n\nRow 1: [X, X, X]\n\nRow 2: [X, 0, X]\n\nRow 3: [X, X, X]\n\nWait, in Example 0, the output is three rows where the middle row has a 0. But in Example 1, the output is three rows where the middle row is [0,7,0], which is 0 in the first and third positions? Wait, no, the rows in Example 1's output are [7,0,7], [0,7,0], [7,0,7]. So each row is of length 3. The first and third rows have X, 0, X, and the middle row is 0, X, 0. So that's a different pattern. So perhaps the output is the triplet of rows that form a kind of X pattern, where the middle row is 0 in the middle and X on the ends, and the other rows are X in the middle and 0s around? Not sure. Let's check other examples.\n\nLooking at Example 2. The output is [4,0,4], [4,4,4], [4,0,4]. So the first and third rows have 4,0,4, and the middle row is all 4s. Hmm, that's a different structure. So maybe the output is the group where the first and third rows have the same structure with a 0 in the middle, and the middle row is all the same number. Wait, but how does this fit with the other examples?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the triplet that has the highest number in the input. Let's check. In Example 0, the input has 8s which are the highest. Example 1's output has 7, which is the highest in the input. Example 2's output is 4, which is the highest in the input? Wait the input in Example 2 includes 8. Oh, the test input in Example 2 is [3,0,0,4,0,4,2,0,0,8,0,0,1,0,0], etc. But the output is 4s. So maybe the highest number isn't the key. So that's not it.\n\nAnother approach: Maybe the pattern involves grouping the input into triplets of three consecutive rows and selecting the triplet that has a certain property. For example, in Example 0, the input has 9 rows (3 triplets of 3 rows each). The output is the last triplet. But why? The triplet has 8s, which is the highest number. But in Example 3, the input has 12 rows. Let me check Example 3.\n\nExample 3's input is:\n\n[0,7,7]\n[7,7,0]\n[7,0,7]\n[3,0,0]\n[0,3,3]\n[3,0,0]\n[2,0,0]\n[0,2,2]\n[2,0,0]\n[8,0,0]\n[0,8,8]\n[8,0,0]\n\nThe output is the first three rows. So the first triplet. So why is that? The output here is [0,7,7], [7,7,0], [7,0,7]. What's the pattern here? These rows form a kind of rotating pattern. The first row starts with 0, then two 7s. The next row starts with 7,7,0. Then the third row is 7,0,7. So maybe the pattern here is that each row is a rotation of the previous one? Or maybe each row has two 7s and a 0, arranged in different positions. So the triplet that forms a cycle of shifting the 0's position. But how does that fit with the other examples?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is the triplet where the sum of the elements is the highest. Let's check. In Example 0, the output triplet's sum for each row is 8*3=24 for the first and third rows, and 8+0+8=16. Total sum would be 24+16+24=64. The other triplets have lower sums. For example, the first triplet in Example 0 has 6+0+6=12, 0+6+6=12, 6+0+6=12. Sum is 36. Then the next triplet (4s) sum would be 4*3 + ... 4+0+4=8, etc. So the highest sum triplet is selected. That might fit. Let's check Example 1. The output triplet's rows are 7+0+7=14, 0+7+0=7, 7+0+7=14. Sum is 35. The input in Example 1 includes other numbers like 2,3,1. Let's see: the first triplet of the input is [2,0,0,3,0,0,7,0,7,1,0,0]. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the structure. Wait, in Example 1's input, each line is a list of 12 numbers. Wait no, looking at the formatting:\n\nINPUT: \n\n[2, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 7, 0, 7, 1, 0, 0]\n[2, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 1, 0, 0]\n[0, 2, 2, 0, 3, 3, 7, 0, 7, 0, 1, 1]\n\nSo each row is a list of 12 elements. Then the output is three rows of 3 elements each. So perhaps the input is a set of multiple sequences concatenated into each row. For example, each row in the input is divided into groups of 3, and the output is selecting a specific group. Let me see.\n\nIn Example 1, the output is [7,0,7], [0,7,0], [7,0,7]. Looking at the input rows:\n\nFirst input row: [2,0,0,3,0,0,7,0,7,1,0,0] \u2192 split into 4 groups of 3: [2,0,0], [3,0,0], [7,0,7], [1,0,0]. Similarly, the second input row: [2,0,0,3,0,0,0,7,0,1,0,0] \u2192 groups: [2,0,0], [3,0,0], [0,7,0], [1,0,0]. Third input row: [0,2,2,0,3,3,7,0,7,0,1,1] \u2192 [0,2,2], [0,3,3], [7,0,7], [0,1,1].\n\nSo the output seems to be the third group (index 2) of each row. So the third group from each of the three input rows forms the output. For example, first row's third group is [7,0,7], second row's third group is [0,7,0], third row's third group is [7,0,7]. So when combined, these three groups form the output. So the pattern here is that the output is the set of third groups from each row in the input. But wait, the input has three rows, each split into four groups of three. The output is the third group of each row. Then Example 1's output is formed by taking the third group from each input row.\n\nLet's check Example 0. The input is:\n\n[6,0,6]\n[0,6,6]\n[6,0,6]\n[4,0,4]\n[0,4,4]\n[4,0,4]\n[8,8,8]\n[8,0,8]\n[8,8,8]\n\nEach row is a group of three. So the input is 9 rows, each a group of three. Then the output is the last three rows. So perhaps the input is divided into triplets of three rows each, and the output is the triplet with the highest value. In Example 0, the last triplet (8s) is the output. In Example 1, the input rows are longer, so each row is divided into groups of three, and the output is the triplet of groups from each row's third group. So maybe the pattern is that the output is the group (from each row) that has the maximum value. Wait, in Example 1, the groups with 7 are the third ones, which is higher than 2,3,1 in the other groups. Similarly, in Example 0, the last triplet has 8s, which is the highest. Example 3's output is the first triplet (7s), which is higher than the others (3, 2,8). Wait, but in Example 3's input, there's a triplet with 8s towards the end. The input in Example 3 is:\n\n[0,7,7]\n[7,7,0]\n[7,0,7]\n[3,0,0]\n[0,3,3]\n[3,0,0]\n[2,0,0]\n[0,2,2]\n[2,0,0]\n[8,0,0]\n[0,8,8]\n[8,0,0]\n\nSo the output is the first three rows (7s). The 8s are in the last three rows. But why isn't the 8 triplet the output? So maybe the maximum value isn't the key here. That contradicts the earlier idea. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the first triplet that forms a certain pattern. For example, in Example 3, the first triplet has 7s arranged in a way where each row shifts the 0. The first row is 0,7,7. Second is 7,7,0. Third is 7,0,7. So each row has two 7s and a 0 in different positions. So maybe the pattern is that the triplet is a set of three rows where each row has two instances of a number and a zero, arranged in a way that cycles through the positions. Then the output is the first such triplet in the input. But how does that fit with the other examples?\n\nLet me try another angle. Let's look at the output of each example and see what they have in common.\n\nExample 0 output: All 8s, middle row has a 0 in the center. The triplet is symmetric.\n\nExample 1 output: The middle row has 0s around a 7, and the other rows have 7s around 0. It's like a cross.\n\nExample 2 output: Middle row is all 4s, first and third have 4,0,4. So symmetric.\n\nExample 3 output: Each row has two 7s and a 0 in different positions, forming a cycle.\n\nWhat's common here? It seems that the output is a triplet of rows that form a specific pattern with a certain number. The number used is the maximum in the triplet. But in Example 3, the 7 is not the maximum (there's 8 in the input), but the output uses 7. So that contradicts the max theory.\n\nAlternative approach: Maybe each row in the input is part of a group, and the output is the group (three consecutive rows) that has the highest occurrence of a particular number. Or perhaps the output is the group where all three rows contain the same number, but arranged in a certain pattern.\n\nWait, in Example 0's output, all three rows have 8. The first and third rows are [8,8,8], and the middle is [8,0,8]. So the number 8 is dominant. Similarly, Example 1's output uses 7. Example 2 uses 4, Example 3 uses 7. So perhaps the output is the group where the number is the highest possible, but in Example 3, there's an 8 in the input. So that doesn't add up. Example 3's output uses 7, but there are 8s in the input. So that can't be.\n\nAnother idea: Maybe the output is the group where the sum of all elements is the highest. Let's calculate for each example.\n\nExample 0 output: Each row is 8,8,8 (sum 24), 8+0+8=16, 24 again. Total sum 24+16+24=64.\n\nOther triplets in Example 0: The first triplet (6s and 0s) sum per row: 12, 12, 12. Total 36. The second triplet (4s) sum: 8, 8, 8. Total 24. So the output triplet has the highest sum. That fits.\n\nExample 1 output sum: 14 (7+0+7) +7 (0+7+0) +14 = 35. Let's see other triplets in the input. For example, the first triplet of each group in the input rows. For the first input row: [2,0,0] sum 2; second row's first triplet [2,0,0] sum 2; third row's first triplet [0,2,2] sum 4. So total for that triplet would be 2+2+4=8. Other triplets may have higher sums. For example, the third triplet in the input rows (7,0,7; 0,7,0; 7,0,7) sum 14+7+14=35, which matches the output sum. So yes, the output triplet has the highest sum.\n\nExample 2's output sum: 4+0+4=8, 4*3=12, 8. Total 28. Let's check other triplets in the input. The input has 3,4,2,8, etc. The triplet with 8 would have higher sum. For example, in the input, there's a triplet [8,0,0], [0,8,8], [8,0,0]. Sum per row: 8, 16, 8. Total sum 32. But the output is 4's triplet sum 28. So this contradicts the sum theory. Therefore, this can't be the right pattern.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let's look at Example 2's input:\n\nInput rows:\n\n[3,0,0,4,0,4,2,0,0,8,0,0,1,0,0] \u2192 length 15. Split into groups of 3: [3,0,0], [4,0,4], [2,0,0], [8,0,0], [1,0,0]. Wait no, length 15: 5 groups of 3. So the first row is 15 elements, split into 5 triplets. Then the second row is 15 elements split into 5 triplets, and the third row is 15 elements split into 5 triplets. The output is [4,0,4], [4,4,4], [4,0,4], which sums to 8, 12, 8 = 28. But in the input, there's a triplet with 8s. For example, in the first input row, the triplet [8,0,0] would sum 8. So maybe the output triplet is not the highest sum. So the sum theory is invalid.\n\nAlternative approach: Maybe the output is the group that is repeated the most times in the input. For example, in Example 0, the triplet [8,8,8], [8,0,8], [8,8,8] appears once. Other triplets may appear more, but perhaps that's not the case. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that the output is the first triplet where all three rows contain the same number, except for a single zero in the middle row. Like, the first and third rows are all X, and the middle row is X, 0, X.\n\nLooking at Example 0's output: first and third rows are [8,8,8], middle is [8,0,8]. So yes. Example 1's output: first and third rows are [7,0,7], middle is [0,7,0]. Wait, no. The first and third rows are [7,0,7], middle row [0,7,0]. So this doesn't fit the previous pattern. So maybe not.\n\nAnother possibility: The output triplet has a certain structure where the middle row's middle element is 0, and the first and third rows have 0 in the middle. For example, in Example 1's output, the first and third rows have 0 in the middle. Middle row has 7 in the middle. Wait, no. Let me check:\n\nExample 1's output:\n\nRow 1: [7,0,7] \u2192 0 in middle.\n\nRow 2: [0,7,0] \u2192 7 in middle.\n\nRow 3: [7,0,7] \u2192 0 in middle.\n\nSo the middle row has 7 in the middle, others have 0. So perhaps the output is a triplet where the middle row has the number in the center, and the first and third rows have the number on the ends with 0 in the center. That seems like a possible pattern. So the structure would be:\n\nRow 1: X, 0, X\n\nRow 2: 0, X, 0\n\nRow 3: X, 0, X\n\nBut then Example 0's output doesn't fit this. Example 0's output has:\n\nRow 1: X, X, X\n\nRow 2: X, 0, X\n\nRow 3: X, X, X\n\nSo different. So perhaps there are multiple possible patterns. This makes it difficult.\n\nAlternative idea: Let's consider that in the training examples, the output is always a triplet where each row is of the form [A, B, C], and the triplet forms a symmetrical pattern. For example, the middle row is a mirror of the first and third rows. Looking at Example 0's output: the middle row is [8,0,8], which is symmetric. The first and third rows are all 8s. Example 1's output rows are [7,0,7], [0,7,0], [7,0,7], which are all symmetric. Example 2's output: [4,0,4], [4,4,4], [4,0,4], all symmetric. Example 3's output: [0,7,7], [7,7,0], [7,0,7]. Each of these rows is symmetric. Wait, [0,7,7] is not symmetric. Its reverse would be [7,7,0], which is the next row. So the triplet as a whole forms a kind of rotational symmetry. So maybe the output is the first triplet in the input where each row is a palindrome (reads the same forwards and backwards) or the triplet as a whole has a certain symmetry.\n\nLooking at Example 3's output:\n\nRow 1: [0,7,7] \u2192 not a palindrome.\n\nRow 2: [7,7,0] \u2192 not a palindrome.\n\nRow 3: [7,0,7] \u2192 palindrome.\n\nSo only the third row is a palindrome. So that's not it.\n\nAnother approach: Looking at the test input:\n\nTest Input:\n\n[0,5,0]\n[5,0,5]\n[0,5,0]\n[0,3,0]\n[3,0,3]\n[0,3,0]\n[6,0,6]\n[6,6,0]\n[6,0,6]\n[0,4,0]\n[4,0,4]\n[0,4,0]\n[0,8,0]\n[8,0,8]\n[0,8,0]\n\nSo there are 15 rows here. If we split them into triplets, it's 5 triplets of 3 rows each. For example:\n\nTriplet 1:\n[0,5,0]\n[5,0,5]\n[0,5,0]\n\nTriplet 2:\n[0,3,0]\n[3,0,3]\n[0,3,0]\n\nTriplet 3:\n[6,0,6]\n[6,6,0]\n[6,0,6]\n\nTriplet 4:\n[0,4,0]\n[4,0,4]\n[0,4,0]\n\nTriplet 5:\n[0,8,0]\n[8,0,8]\n[0,8,0]\n\nNow, according to the training examples, the pattern may be selecting the triplet with the highest number. The highest number here is 8 in triplet 5. So the output would be triplet 5. But let's check if this aligns with the training examples.\n\nIn Example 0, the triplet with 8 is selected. In Example 1, 7 is selected, which is the highest in the input. Example 2's output is 4, but the input includes an 8. Wait, this contradicts. So maybe that's not the pattern. In Example 2's input, there's a group with 8, but the output is 4. So why?\n\nLooking back at Example 2's input:\n\nThe input rows are:\n\nRow 1: [3,0,0,4,0,4,2,0,0,8,0,0,1,0,0] \u2192 split into 5 triplets: [3,0,0], [4,0,4], [2,0,0], [8,0,0], [1,0,0]\n\nRow 2: [0,3,3,4,4,4,0,2,2,0,8,8,0,1,1] \u2192 triplets: [0,3,3], [4,4,4], [0,2,2], [0,8,8], [0,1,1]\n\nRow 3: [0,3,0,4,0,4,0,2,0,0,8,0,0,1,0] \u2192 triplets: [0,3,0], [4,0,4], [0,2,0], [0,8,0], [0,1,0]\n\nThe output is [4,0,4], [4,4,4], [4,0,4]. Looking at the triplet in row 1's second group ([4,0,4]), row 2's second group ([4,4,4]), row 3's second group ([4,0,4]). So the output is the triplet from the second group of each row. So the group index is 1 (if zero-based) or 2 (if one-based). But why is this group selected?\n\nThe number 4 is not the highest in the input. There's 8 in some groups. So perhaps the pattern is that the output is the first group where the three corresponding triplets from each row form a certain pattern. For example, the first triplet from each row in Example 2's input is [3,0,0], [0,3,3], [0,3,0]. The second group is [4,0,4], [4,4,4], [4,0,4]. Which is the output. So the pattern here is that each of the three rows in the group has the same number (4) and forms a symmetric pattern. So the group is the one where the triplet across the rows forms a pattern of [X,0,X], [X,X,X], [X,0,X]. Which is the case for 4 in Example 2.\n\nSimilarly, in Example 1, the output is the third group of each row. Let's check:\n\nExample 1's input rows:\n\nRow 1: [2,0,0,3,0,0,7,0,7,1,0,0] \u2192 groups 0: [2,0,0], 1: [3,0,0], 2: [7,0,7], 3: [1,0,0]\n\nRow 2: [2,0,0,3,0,0,0,7,0,1,0,0] \u2192 groups 2: [0,7,0]\n\nRow 3: [0,2,2,0,3,3,7,0,7,0,1,1] \u2192 groups 2: [7,0,7]\n\nSo the output is the triplet formed by group 2 of each row: [7,0,7] from row 1, [0,7,0] from row 2, [7,0,7] from row 3. This forms the output.\n\nThe pattern here seems to be that for each group in the input (each group being a set of three elements from each row), the output is the group where the three rows form a certain pattern. Specifically, the first and third rows are the same, and the middle row has the zero in the middle. Like a sandwich.\n\nWait, in Example 0's output, the group is the triplet of rows:\n\n[8,8,8]\n[8,0,8]\n[8,8,8]\n\nWhich fits the pattern of first and third rows being the same (all 8s), and the middle row has 8s with a zero in the center.\n\nExample 1's output has:\n\n[7,0,7]\n[0,7,0]\n[7,0,7]\n\nFirst and third rows are the same, middle row is different but related (0s and 7 swapped).\n\nExample 2's output:\n\n[4,0,4]\n[4,4,4]\n[4,0,4]\n\nFirst and third rows are the same, middle row is all 4s.\n\nExample 3's output:\n\n[0,7,7]\n[7,7,0]\n[7,0,7]\n\nNot sure if this fits. The first and third rows are not the same. So maybe this is a different pattern.\n\nBut Example 3's output seems to be the first triplet in the input. Let's see. The input starts with three rows forming the output. But why this triplet?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is the first group where all three rows contain the same number in some positions, forming a certain shape.\n\nPutting all this together, it's possible that the output is the group (i.e., the triplet of rows taken from the same group index across the input rows) where the first and third rows are the same and have a zero in the middle, and the middle row has zeros on the ends and the number in the middle. Or some variation of this pattern.\n\nIn the test input, each triplet is:\n\nTriplet 1 (5s):\n\n[0,5,0]\n[5,0,5]\n[0,5,0]\n\nFirst and third rows are same, middle row is 5,0,5. So this triplet would fit the pattern where first and third rows are [0,5,0], middle row is [5,0,5]. This is similar to Example 3's output, but in that example, the triplet was selected even though it's not the highest number. However, the test input's triplet 5 has 8s:\n\nTriplet 5:\n\n[0,8,0]\n[8,0,8]\n[0,8,0]\n\nWhich follows the same pattern as triplet 1 but with 8. If the pattern is to select the triplet with the highest number, this would be the one. But in Example 3, the output used 7 despite there being an 8 in the input. So maybe there's another pattern.\n\nWait, in Example 3, the output is the first triplet with 7s, which comes before the 8s in the input. So perhaps the pattern is to select the first triplet that forms a certain structure, regardless of the number's value. The structure for Example 3's output is each row has two 7s and a 0, arranged in a way that cycles through positions. The first row is 0,7,7. Second is 7,7,0. Third is 7,0,7. This forms a rotating pattern. Similarly, in the test input's triplet 3:\n\n[6,0,6]\n[6,6,0]\n[6,0,6]\n\nThis triplet has two 6s and a 0 in each row, but the positions are changing. First row is 6,0,6. Second is 6,6,0. Third is 6,0,6. The middle row is different, but the first and third are same. Maybe this is the pattern. If we follow Example 3's pattern, the output would be the first triplet that has this rotating pattern. But in the test input, the first triplet with 5s follows a pattern where first and third rows are [0,5,0], and the middle is [5,0,5]. This is similar to the pattern in Example 1's output, where the first and third rows are [7,0,7], and the middle is [0,7,0]. So maybe the pattern is to select the triplet where the first and third rows are the same and have the number in the ends with a zero in the middle, and the middle row has the number in the middle with zeros on the ends.\n\nIn the test input, the triplet 5 (8s) has this structure:\n\nFirst and third rows: [0,8,0] \u2192 0 in middle.\n\nMiddle row: [8,0,8] \u2192 8 in middle.\n\nBut the first and third rows are not the same as each other (they are the same in this case), but in Example 1, the first and third rows are [7,0,7], which are the same. So maybe the triplet in the test input that matches this pattern is triplet 5, which has the highest number. But why would Example 3's output not follow this pattern?\n\nThis is getting complicated. Maybe I should look for another pattern.\n\nAnother observation: In all training examples, the output triplet has exactly three rows. The input is structured such that each row in the input is split into multiple triplets (groups of three elements), and the output is formed by selecting one group from each row. For example, in Example 1, each input row is divided into four groups of three elements. The output is the third group from each row, combined into three new rows. So for each input row, take the third group, and those become the output rows.\n\nSo, for example, in Example 0, each input row is already a group of three. The output is the last three rows of the input. So perhaps in Example 0, the groups are the rows themselves, and the output is the last group (triplet) which has the highest number.\n\nExample 2's input rows are longer, so each row is split into groups of three. The output is the second group from each row. For example:\n\nRow 1: [3,0,0,4,0,4,2,0,0,8,0,0,1,0,0] \u2192 groups: [3,0,0], [4,0,4], [2,0,0], [8,0,0], [1,0,0]\n\nRow 2: [0,3,3,4,4,4,0,2,2,0,8,8,0,1,1] \u2192 groups: [0,3,3], [4,4,4], [0,2,2], [0,8,8], [0,1,1]\n\nRow 3: [0,3,0,4,0,4,0,2,0,0,8,0,0,1,0] \u2192 groups: [0,3,0], [4,0,4], [0,2,0], [0,8,0], [0,1,0]\n\nThe output is [4,0,4], [4,4,4], [4,0,4], which are the second group (index 1) of each row.\n\nSo the pattern seems to be that the output is formed by selecting the same group index from each row of the input. The group index is determined by which group has a certain property, such as the highest number in the group.\n\nSo the steps could be:\n\n1. Split each row of the input into groups of three elements.\n\n2. For each group index (0-based), check if the groups at that index across all rows form a valid triplet pattern.\n\n3. The valid pattern could be that the first and third rows of the group are the same, and the middle row has a 0 in the center, etc.\n\n4. Select the group index that has the highest number present in the groups.\n\nBut in Example 3, this doesn't hold. Let's look:\n\nExample 3's input rows are:\n\nRow 1: [0,7,7] \u2192 group [0,7,7]\n\nRow 2: [7,7,0] \u2192 group [7,7,0]\n\nRow 3: [7,0,7] \u2192 group [7,0,7]\n\nThen the next groups are 3s, 2s, etc. The output is the first group of each row: [0,7,7], [7,7,0], [7,0,7]. So here, each row is a single group (since length 3), and the output is the first group of each row, which forms the output triplet.\n\nBut why is this selected? The groups here have the number 7, which is higher than some other groups but lower than 8. So perhaps the pattern is to select the first group where the triplet has the highest number in any of its elements, but not sure.\n\nThis is getting too complicated. Let's try to generalize:\n\nThe output is a triplet formed by groups from each input row at the same group index. The group index is determined by the following:\n\n- The group contains a certain pattern (e.g., symmetric rows).\n\n- The group's maximum number is the highest possible among all groups.\n\nIn Example 0, the last group (index 2) has 8, the highest.\n\nIn Example 1, the third group (index 2) has 7, the highest.\n\nIn Example 2, the second group (index 1) has 4, but there are groups with 8. So this contradicts.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the group with the highest minimal number in the triplet. Or the group where all three groups have the same number.\n\nAlternatively, the group where the triplet forms a \"full\" pattern, like the one in Example 0's output where the first and third rows are all X and the middle row has X with a 0.\n\nAnother idea: The output is the group where the three groups from each row form a pattern where the first and third groups are the same, and the middle group is a variation of it with a 0 in the center.\n\nIn Example 0's output, the groups are [8,8,8], [8,0,8], [8,8,8]. First and third groups are the same, middle has 0.\n\nExample 1's output groups are [7,0,7], [0,7,0], [7,0,7]. First and third groups are the same.\n\nExample 2's output groups are [4,0,4], [4,4,4], [4,0,4]. First and third groups are the same.\n\nExample 3's output groups are [0,7,7], [7,7,0], [7,0,7]. Not the same, but forms a rotating pattern.\n\nSo perhaps the pattern is that the first and third groups in the triplet are the same, and the middle group is a variation. If that's the case, then in the test input, we need to find the group where the first and third groups are the same, and the middle group has a certain pattern.\n\nLooking at the test input:\n\nEach row is a group of three. So each row is one group. The input is 15 rows, split into 5 triplets (each triplet consists of three consecutive rows).\n\nLooking at the triplets:\n\nTriplet 1 (rows 0-2):\n\n[0,5,0]\n[5,0,5]\n[0,5,0]\n\nFirst and third rows are the same. Middle row is [5,0,5]. This fits the pattern where first and third rows are same, and middle row is X,0,X.\n\nTriplet 2 (rows 3-5):\n\n[0,3,0]\n[3,0,3]\n[0,3,0]\n\nSame pattern with 3.\n\nTriplet 3 (rows 6-8):\n\n[6,0,6]\n[6,6,0]\n[6,0,6]\n\nFirst and third rows are same ([6,0,6]). Middle row is [6,6,0], which doesn't fit the X,0,X pattern.\n\nTriplet 4 (rows 9-11):\n\n[0,4,0]\n[4,0,4]\n[0,4,0]\n\nSame as first two triplets, but with 4.\n\nTriplet 5 (rows 12-14):\n\n[0,8,0]\n[8,0,8]\n[0,8,0]\n\nSame pattern with 8.\n\nSo all triplets except triplet 3 follow the pattern where the first and third rows are the same and have a zero in the middle, and the middle row has the number in the middle with zeros on the ends. So according to the pattern from the training examples, the output should be the triplet with the highest number, which is triplet 5 (8s).\n\nBut why is Example 3's output different? Because in Example 3, the triplet with 7 comes before the 8 triplet. So maybe the pattern is to select the first such triplet, not the highest. But Example 0's output is the last triplet. This contradiction complicates things.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the pattern is that the output is the triplet that appears latest in the input (highest in the list) with the highest number. In Example 0, the triplet with 8 is last. In Example 1, the triplet with 7 is the third group. Example 3's output is the first triplet, but that has 7, and there's a later triplet with 8. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, the pattern is to select the triplet with the highest number, and if there are multiple, choose the last one. In the test input, triplet 5 has 8, which is the highest, so it's selected. Example 0 and 1 follow this. Example 2's output is 4, but there's an 8 in the input. So that's a problem.\n\nWait, in Example 2's input, the group with 8 is:\n\nFrom row 1: [8,0,0], row 2: [0,8,8], row 3: [0,8,0]. So the groups are:\n\n[8,0,0], [0,8,8], [0,8,0]\n\nBut this triplet doesn't form the required pattern. The first and third groups are [8,0,0] and [0,8,0], which are not the same. The middle group is [0,8,8]. So perhaps this triplet doesn't fit the pattern, so the next highest is 4. But the output triplet for 4 is [4,0,4], [4,4,4], [4,0,4]. This fits the pattern where first and third groups are same, middle is all 4s. So maybe the pattern is to select the triplet that has the highest number where the first and third groups are the same and the middle group is all X or X,0,X.\n\nIn the test input, the triplet with 8 follows the pattern where first and third groups are [0,8,0] and middle is [8,0,8]. So this would fit, and since 8 is the highest, this triplet would be selected.\n\nThus, the final answer should be the triplet with 8s:\n\n[0,8,0]\n[8,0,8]\n[0,8,0]\n\nBut according to the pattern in the training examples, especially Example 0 and 1, where the output is the highest number triplet, this would make sense.\n\nBut in Example 3's output, the triplet with 7 is selected despite the presence of 8. However, in Example 3's input, the 8 triplet is:\n\n[8,0,0]\n[0,8,8]\n[8,0,0]\n\nWhich doesn't fit the pattern of having first and third groups the same and the middle group in a certain way. The first group is [8,0,0], third group is [8,0,0], but the middle group is [0,8,8]. So the first and third groups are the same, but the middle group is different. Maybe this is why it's not selected. So the pattern requires not only the first and third groups to be the same, but the middle group to have a certain structure. For example, in Example 0's output, the middle group is [8,0,8]. In Example 1, the middle group is [0,7,0]. In Example 2's output, the middle group is [4,4,4]. So the middle group can vary as long as the first and third are the same.\n\nIn Example 3's input, the 8 triplet's middle group is [0,8,8], which doesn't fit. So perhaps the pattern requires the middle group to have the same number in all positions or have the number in the middle with zeros on the ends.\n\nGiven all this, the test input's triplet 5 with 8s fits the pattern where the first and third groups are [0,8,0], and the middle group is [8,0,8]. So this should be the output.",

        "cot_2": "Okay, let's tackle this puzzle. So, the task is to figure out the pattern that transforms the input arrays into the output ones based on the training examples provided. Then apply that pattern to the test input.\n\nFirst, let me look at the training examples to understand the pattern.\n\nStarting with Example 0:\n\nINPUT:\nThree different groups of arrays. The first group has [6,0,6], [0,6,6], [6,0,6]. Then [4,0,4] etc., and finally [8,8,8], [8,0,8], [8,8,8]. The OUTPUT is the last three arrays of the input. So the output is the 8's group. So maybe the output is the largest number's pattern?\n\nWait, in Example 0's input, the numbers involved are 6,4,8. The output is all the 8s. So perhaps the output is the group with the highest number?\n\nIn Example 1:\n\nInput arrays have numbers 2,3,7,1. The output is the group with 7s. So again, the highest number here is 7. So the output is the group of 7s.\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput numbers include 3,4,2,8,1. The output is the 4s. Wait, the highest number here is 8, but the output is 4. Hmm, so that contradicts the previous idea. So maybe not the highest number. Wait, what's the pattern here?\n\nLooking at Example 2's input:\n\nThe input arrays have numbers like 3,4,2,8,1. The output is [4,0,4], [4,4,4], [4,0,4]. So the number 4. But 8 is higher. So maybe not the highest. So that's a problem.\n\nWait, maybe it's the most frequent number in the input? Let's check.\n\nIn Example 0, the input has 6,4,8. How many times each occurs. Let's count:\n\n6 appears in the first three rows, then 4 appears in the next three, then 8. So each group is three rows. The output is the last group (8s), which is the highest. But in example 1, the output is the 7s group, which is the highest. Example 3's output is the 7s group again. But Example 2's output is 4s, which isn't the highest (there's 8). So maybe that's not it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is the group that forms a symmetric pattern. Let's look at the outputs.\n\nIn Example 0's output, each array in the output is symmetric. The first is [8,8,8], then [8,0,8], then [8,8,8]. So all three are symmetric. Similarly, in Example 1's output, each row is symmetric: [7,0,7], [0,7,0], [7,0,7]. Wait, no. The second row is [0,7,0], which is symmetric. The third is [7,0,7], symmetric. So the output arrays are symmetric. So maybe the pattern is to find the group (set of three consecutive arrays) where all three arrays are symmetric, and select that group as the output. Let's check other examples.\n\nExample 3's input has several groups. The output is the first three arrays:\n\n[0,7,7], [7,7,0], [7,0,7]. Are these symmetric? Let's see:\n\n[0,7,7] reversed is [7,7,0], which is not the same as the original. Wait, but symmetry here might mean each individual array is a palindrome (same forwards and backwards). So for [0,7,7], reversed is [7,7,0], which is different. So that array isn't symmetric. Hmm. So maybe that's not the case. But the output's first array is [0,7,7], which isn't symmetric. So maybe the group has a different kind of symmetry.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each group consists of three arrays that are rotations or permutations of each other, forming a pattern. Let's look at Example 3's output group:\n\nFirst array: [0,7,7]\n\nSecond: [7,7,0]\n\nThird: [7,0,7]\n\nLooking at these, they might be rotations or shifts. For instance, shifting the first array to the left by one gives [7,7,0], which is the second array. Then shifting again gives [7,0,7]. So maybe the group is a set where each array is a cyclic permutation of the others. If so, the output is the group where all three arrays are cyclic permutations of each other. Let's check the other examples.\n\nExample 0's output group: all three are [8,8,8], [8,0,8], [8,8,8]. Wait, the first and third arrays are the same. The middle one is [8,0,8], which is a palindrome. So maybe not cyclic permutations. But perhaps each array in the group is a palindrome. Let's check:\n\n[8,8,8] is a palindrome.\n\n[8,0,8] is a palindrome.\n\n[8,8,8] is a palindrome. So yes, each array in the output group is a palindrome.\n\nIn Example 1's output:\n\n[7,0,7] is a palindrome.\n\n[0,7,0] is a palindrome.\n\n[7,0,7] is a palindrome. So all three are palindromes.\n\nExample 2's output is [4,0,4], [4,4,4], [4,0,4]. All three are palindromes.\n\nExample 3's output group:\n\n[0,7,7] is not a palindrome. But the next array [7,7,0] is not a palindrome. The third array [7,0,7] is a palindrome. Wait, but this contradicts the previous pattern. So maybe the earlier examples have output groups where all three are palindromic, but Example 3's output group doesn't. So this theory is invalid.\n\nHmm, perhaps I need another approach. Let's look for another pattern.\n\nLooking at the inputs and outputs:\n\nEach input is a list of multiple arrays, grouped into sets. For example, in Example 0, the input has 9 arrays, which can be divided into three groups of three each: first three (6s), then three (4s), then three (8s). The output is the last group. But in Example 1, the input has 3 arrays, but the output is a group of three arrays. Wait, no. Wait, Example 1's input is three arrays, but the output is three arrays. Wait, maybe the input is a list of multiple groups, each consisting of three arrays, and the output is the group that has the highest maximum value among the groups. Let's check.\n\nExample 0: The groups are:\n\nGroup 1 (6,0,6), (0,6,6), (6,0,6) \u2192 max is 6.\n\nGroup 2 (4s) \u2192 max 4.\n\nGroup 3 (8s) \u2192 max 8. So output is group 3.\n\nExample 1: The input has three arrays. Wait, but the input is a list of three arrays. How is this grouped? Wait, perhaps each group is three consecutive arrays, but in Example 1's input, there are three arrays. So perhaps the group is the entire input. But the output is three arrays. Wait, maybe each group is a triplet. So in the input, the arrays are arranged in triplets. For example, in Example 0's input, there are nine arrays, three triplets. Each triplet is a group. The output is the triplet with the highest maximum number in the group. Let's check.\n\nIn Example 0's input groups:\n\nFirst triplet: 6,0,6; 0,6,6; 6,0,6. The max in each array is 6. The group's max is 6.\n\nSecond triplet: 4,0,4 etc. Max 4.\n\nThird triplet: 8s. Max 8. So output is the third triplet.\n\nExample 1's input is three arrays. So one group. Max numbers in each array: first array has 7, second has 7, third has 7. So the group's max is 7. But the output is the same as the input? Wait, no. The input is three arrays, and the output is three arrays. But in the example, the output is [7,0,7], [0,7,0], [7,0,7]. But the input's third array is [0,2,2,0,3,3,7,0,7,0,1,1]. Wait, but the input arrays in Example 1 are longer. Let's check:\n\nWait, the INPUT for Example 1 is three arrays, each of length 12. The output is three arrays of length 3. So how does that fit? Oh, maybe the input arrays are divided into sections. For example, each array in the input is split into parts. Let me think again.\n\nThis approach might not be working. Let's look for another pattern.\n\nAlternative idea: The output is the group where each array in the group has exactly two non-zero elements. Wait, let's check.\n\nExample 0's output: [8,8,8] has three non-zero elements, but it's in the output. So no.\n\nAnother approach: Let's see what's common in all output groups. For each example, the output group's arrays have a certain structure.\n\nLooking at Example 0's output:\n\n[8,8,8]\n[8,0,8]\n[8,8,8]\n\nThis looks like a diamond or hourglass pattern. The middle element is 0 in the middle array. The others are 8.\n\nSimilarly, Example 1's output:\n\n[7,0,7]\n[0,7,0]\n[7,0,7]\n\nThis also forms a similar pattern. The middle array has 0 in the middle.\n\nExample 2's output:\n\n[4,0,4]\n[4,4,4]\n[4,0,4]\n\nAgain, middle array is all 4s, the others have 0 in the middle.\n\nExample 3's output:\n\n[0,7,7]\n[7,7,0]\n[7,0,7]\n\nHmm, this is a different pattern. The first array starts with 0, then two 7s. The second array is 7,7,0. The third is 7,0,7. So each array is a rotation or shift. Maybe this is a different structure. But why is this the output?\n\nWait, perhaps the output is the group that forms a certain cyclic pattern. Like, each array in the group is a rotation of the others. For example, in Example 3's output:\n\n[0,7,7] \u2192 rotated once becomes [7,7,0] \u2192 rotated again becomes [7,0,7]. But the third array, when rotated, would become [0,7,7], which is the first array. So it's a cycle of three.\n\nSimilarly, in Example 1's output:\n\n[7,0,7], [0,7,0], [7,0,7]. Wait, rotating [7,0,7] would give [0,7,7], but that's not the next array. Hmm, maybe not rotation. Let's think again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each group in the output has a specific non-zero number that appears in a certain pattern, and other numbers are zeros. For example, the number is 8 in Example 0, 7 in Example 1, 4 in Example 2, 7 in Example 3. So the output group is the one where the number is the highest possible in the input. But in Example 2, the input includes 8, which is higher than 4. So why is the output 4? That's confusing.\n\nWait, in Example 2's input, the test arrays are longer. Let's look at Example 2's input:\n\nINPUT:\n\n[3, 0, 0, 4, 0, 4, 2, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0]\n\n[0, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4, 0, 2, 2, 0, 8, 8, 0, 1, 1]\n\n[0, 3, 0, 4, 0, 4, 0, 2, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 1, 0]\n\nSo these are three arrays, each of length 15. The output is three arrays of length 3. How does that happen?\n\nAh, maybe the input arrays are split into chunks. For example, each input array is divided into parts of 3 elements each. Let's check Example 2's input:\n\nFirst array: [3,0,0,4,0,4,2,0,0,8,0,0,1,0,0]. Splitting into chunks of 3:\n\n[3,0,0], [4,0,4], [2,0,0], [8,0,0], [1,0,0].\n\nSimilarly, the second array: [0,3,3,4,4,4,0,2,2,0,8,8,0,1,1] \u2192 chunks: [0,3,3], [4,4,4], [0,2,2], [0,8,8], [0,1,1].\n\nThird array: [0,3,0,4,0,4,0,2,0,0,8,0,0,1,0] \u2192 chunks: [0,3,0], [4,0,4], [0,2,0], [0,8,0], [0,1,0].\n\nThe output of Example 2 is:\n\n[4,0,4]\n[4,4,4]\n[4,0,4]\n\nLooking at the chunks, the second chunk of the first array is [4,0,4], the second chunk of the second array is [4,4,4], and the second chunk of the third array is [4,0,4]. So the output is these three chunks. So the pattern might be that in each input array, the same position's chunk is taken, and if those three form a group where they have the same number (but arranged in a pattern), then that's the output.\n\nSo for Example 2, the chunks at position 2 (starting from 0) in each of the three input arrays are [4,0,4], [4,4,4], [4,0,4], which form the output.\n\nSimilarly, looking at Example 0's input:\n\nThe input arrays are split into chunks of 3? Let's see:\n\nExample 0's input arrays are:\n\n[6,0,6]\n\n[0,6,6]\n\n[6,0,6]\n\n[4,0,4]\n\n[0,4,4]\n\n[4,0,4]\n\n[8,8,8]\n\n[8,0,8]\n\n[8,8,8]\n\nEach array is already 3 elements. So the input is grouped into triplets of arrays. The first three arrays form a group, the next three another, and the last three another. The output is the last group. So in this case, each group is three consecutive arrays, each of length 3.\n\nSo the pattern could be: For each group of three consecutive arrays in the input, check if each array in the group has the same non-zero number (like 8 in Example 0), possibly with some zeros in a symmetric pattern. The output is the group that has the highest such number.\n\nWait, but in Example 2, the output is 4s, even though there's an 8 in the input. But according to the input arrays split into chunks, maybe the 8 appears in a different chunk.\n\nIn Example 2's output, the chunks taken are from position 1 (assuming the first chunk is 0, then 1, etc.), which has 4 as the number, and 8 is in a later chunk. So perhaps the output is the chunk group (three arrays' chunks) where all three chunks have the same number and form a specific pattern, and that number is the highest possible among all such groups.\n\nBut this is getting complicated. Let me try to think of the steps:\n\n1. Split each input array into chunks of 3 elements each. So for a long array, like in Example 1, the input arrays are length 12, so split into 4 chunks each of 3 elements. For example, the first input array in Example 1 is [2, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 7, 0, 7, 1, 0, 0], which would split into [2,0,0], [3,0,0], [7,0,7], [1,0,0].\n\n2. Then, group the chunks across the input arrays. For example, the first chunk of each input array forms a group, the second chunk of each forms another group, etc.\n\n3. For each such group (which consists of three chunks, one from each input array), check if they form a valid pattern. The valid pattern seems to be that each chunk in the group has the same number, arranged in a way that the middle chunk is all that number, and the other two have zeros in specific positions. Like, in Example 0's output group, the three chunks are [8,8,8], [8,0,8], [8,8,8]. So the middle array has a zero in the middle. Similarly, Example 1's output group is [7,0,7], [0,7,0], [7,0,7], which is a different pattern but still each array in the group has 7s and zeros arranged symmetrically.\n\nBut how do we select which group is the correct one? It might be that the group with the highest number, but in Example 2's input, there is an 8 in some chunks, but the output is 4. So that theory is invalid.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each group of chunks (from the three input arrays) is considered, and the output is the group where all three chunks have the same number, and that number is the maximum among such groups.\n\nWait, in Example 2's input, let's look for chunks with the same number across the three input arrays.\n\nFirst chunk of input arrays:\n\nFirst input array's first chunk: [3,0,0]\n\nSecond input array's first chunk: [0,3,3]\n\nThird input array's first chunk: [0,3,0]\n\nThese chunks are all related to 3. But they don't form the required pattern. Maybe the number here is 3. But the output is 4. So perhaps the group where all three chunks have the same number. Let's look for that.\n\nIn Example 2, the second chunk of each input array:\n\nFirst input array's second chunk: [4,0,4]\n\nSecond input array's second chunk: [4,4,4]\n\nThird input array's second chunk: [4,0,4]\n\nAll these have the number 4. So this group has all three chunks with 4. Then the third chunks in each input array:\n\nFirst input array's third chunk: [2,0,0]\n\nSecond input array's third chunk: [0,2,2]\n\nThird input array's third chunk: [0,2,0]\n\nThese are 2s, but not all chunks have the same number. The fourth chunk has 8s. Let's check:\n\nFirst input array's fourth chunk: [8,0,0]\n\nSecond's fourth chunk: [0,8,8]\n\nThird's fourth chunk: [0,8,0]\n\nThese are 8s. So the fourth chunk group would be [8,0,0], [0,8,8], [0,8,0]. Do these form a pattern? Not the same as previous outputs, but they do have 8s. So why wasn't this the output?\n\nBecause in Example 2's output, the selected group is the 4s. So maybe the group where all three chunks have the same number and form a specific pattern is selected. The 4s group has [4,0,4], [4,4,4], [4,0,4], which is similar to Example 0's pattern. The 8s group has [8,0,0], [0,8,8], [0,8,0], which may not form the required pattern.\n\nSo the pattern seems to be that the output is the group of three chunks (from each input array) where:\n\n- All chunks in the group have the same non-zero number.\n\n- The chunks form a specific pattern: the middle chunk is filled with the number, and the other two have the number in the first and third positions with zero in the middle. Or another variation.\n\nFor example, in Example 0's output group:\n\nChunk 1: [8,8,8] (all 8s)\n\nChunk 2: [8,0,8]\n\nChunk 3: [8,8,8]\n\nSo the middle chunk has a zero in the middle.\n\nIn Example 1's output group:\n\nEach chunk is [7,0,7], [0,7,0], [7,0,7]. So alternating positions with 7 and zero, forming a cross-like pattern.\n\nIn Example 2's output group:\n\n[4,0,4], [4,4,4], [4,0,4]. Middle chunk is all 4s, the others have 4s at ends and zero in middle.\n\nIn Example 3's output group:\n\nThe chunks are [0,7,7], [7,7,0], [7,0,7]. These are different, but perhaps they form a pattern where the number 7 rotates positions.\n\nSo the key seems to be that the output group is the one where each chunk in the group has the same number, arranged in a specific pattern (like symmetric, all in middle, etc.), and among such groups, select the one with the highest number.\n\nBut why in Example 2, the 8s group is not selected? Because maybe their arrangement doesn't fit the required pattern. The 8s chunks are [8,0,0], [0,8,8], [0,8,0]. These don't form a symmetric pattern like the 4s group. The 4s group's arrangement matches the pattern seen in other examples (middle chunk all 4s, others have 4s on ends with zero in middle). The 8s group doesn't fit this, so the 4s group is selected as it meets the pattern criteria and is the highest such group.\n\nSo the pattern steps would be:\n\n1. Split each input array into chunks of three elements.\n\n2. For each chunk position across all input arrays (i.e., first chunk of all arrays, second chunk, etc.), form groups of three chunks (assuming three input arrays).\n\n3. For each group of chunks:\n\n   a. Check if all chunks in the group have the same non-zero number.\n\n   b. Check if the chunks form a specific pattern (e.g., middle chunk is all the number, others have zeros in the middle; or alternating zeros and the number in a symmetric way).\n\n4. Among all such valid groups, select the one with the highest number.\n\nNow, applying this to the test input.\n\nTest Input:\n\nThe test input is a list of 15 arrays. Wait, no. Let's look:\n\nTest Input:\n\n[0, 5, 0]\n\n[5, 0, 5]\n\n[0, 5, 0]\n\n[0, 3, 0]\n\n[3, 0, 3]\n\n[0, 3, 0]\n\n[6, 0, 6]\n\n[6, 6, 0]\n\n[6, 0, 6]\n\n[0, 4, 0]\n\n[4, 0, 4]\n\n[0, 4, 0]\n\n[0, 8, 0]\n\n[8, 0, 8]\n\n[0, 8, 0]\n\nEach of these is an array of three elements, so there are 15 arrays. Let's see how they're grouped. Since each array is 3 elements, and the examples earlier had input arrays grouped into triplets, perhaps the input here is divided into groups of three arrays each. Let's check:\n\nThe first three arrays:\n\n[0,5,0], [5,0,5], [0,5,0]\n\nThen the next three: [0,3,0], [3,0,3], [0,3,0]\n\nNext three: [6,0,6], [6,6,0], [6,0,6]\n\nNext three: [0,4,0], [4,0,4], [0,4,0]\n\nNext three: [0,8,0], [8,0,8], [0,8,0]\n\nSo each group consists of three consecutive arrays. Each group is a triplet of arrays. Now, for each group, check if they form a valid pattern as per the examples.\n\nLet's analyze each group:\n\nGroup 1: 5s.\n\nFirst array: [0,5,0]\n\nSecond: [5,0,5]\n\nThird: [0,5,0]\n\nPattern: The middle array has 5 at the ends and 0 in the middle. The first and third arrays have 5 in the middle. This doesn't match previous patterns. The middle array is symmetric, but the others have 0s on the ends. Not sure.\n\nGroup 2: 3s.\n\nSame structure as group 1.\n\nGroup 3: 6s.\n\nFirst array: [6,0,6]\n\nSecond: [6,6,0]\n\nThird: [6,0,6]\n\nThis group's middle array is [6,6,0], which isn't symmetric. So this group probably doesn't fit the pattern.\n\nGroup 4: 4s.\n\nSame as group 1 and 2: [0,4,0], [4,0,4], [0,4,0]. Middle array is [4,0,4], which is symmetric. The first and third arrays have 4 in the middle. Not sure.\n\nGroup 5: 8s.\n\nFirst array: [0,8,0]\n\nSecond: [8,0,8]\n\nThird: [0,8,0]\n\nThis group's middle array is [8,0,8], which is symmetric. The first and third arrays have 8 in the middle. This is similar to group 1 and 2. But does this fit the pattern?\n\nIn previous examples, the valid groups have middle array with all the same number (like Example 0) or a symmetric pattern with the number at ends and zero in middle (Example 1). Alternatively, perhaps the valid groups are those where all three arrays are symmetric and follow a pattern.\n\nLooking at group 5:\n\nEach array in the group:\n\n[0,8,0] \u2192 symmetric.\n\n[8,0,8] \u2192 symmetric.\n\n[0,8,0] \u2192 symmetric.\n\nSo all three are symmetric. The middle array has 8 at ends and 0 in the middle, the others have 8 in the middle. This is a pattern like Example 0's group, which had [8,8,8], [8,0,8], [8,8,8]. But here it's [0,8,0], [8,0,8], [0,8,0]. So perhaps this is a different valid pattern.\n\nBut in Example 0's group, the non-middle arrays were all filled with 8s, but here they have 8 in the center. So maybe this isn't the same pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the valid pattern is that the middle array of the group has zeros in the middle and the other arrays are filled with the number or have the number in specific positions.\n\nAlternatively, the group must have a structure where the middle array is all the number, and the other two have the number in certain positions. But in group 5, the middle array is [8,0,8], which is not all 8s.\n\nHmm. This is getting complicated. Let's think back to the training examples.\n\nIn Example 0's output group, the middle array is [8,0,8], which is symmetric. The other two arrays are [8,8,8], which are symmetric as well. So all three are symmetric.\n\nIn Example 1's output group, each array is symmetric. The middle array is [0,7,0], and the others are [7,0,7]. All symmetric.\n\nIn Example 2's output group, all are symmetric. The middle array is [4,4,4], others have 4s at ends and zero in the middle.\n\nIn Example 3's output group, the arrays are:\n\n[0,7,7] \u2192 not symmetric.\n\n[7,7,0] \u2192 not symmetric.\n\n[7,0,7] \u2192 symmetric.\n\nBut why is this the output? Because perhaps the pattern is different here. Maybe the group forms a cycle of rotations. Let's see:\n\n[0,7,7] \u2192 rotate right \u2192 [7,0,7]\n\n[7,0,7] \u2192 rotate right \u2192 [7,7,0]\n\n[7,7,0] \u2192 rotate right \u2192 [0,7,7]\n\nSo this forms a cycle. Maybe the output is the group where the three arrays are rotations of each other, forming a cycle.\n\nSo in the training examples:\n\nExample 0's output group is not rotations. They are [8,8,8], [8,0,8], [8,8,8]. Rotating these doesn't give the others.\n\nExample 1's output group is [7,0,7], [0,7,0], [7,0,7]. Rotating [7,0,7] gives [7,7,0], which isn't in the group.\n\nExample 3's output group is a rotation cycle. So perhaps there are two types of valid patterns: symmetric groups and rotation cycles.\n\nBut this makes it more complex. How to determine which pattern to choose?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is the group that appears first in the input which meets certain criteria. For example, the first group that has a certain pattern.\n\nBut in Example 3, the output is the first group in the input. The input has several groups, but the first group is the 7s group, which is the output. So perhaps the output is the first group that has a certain pattern.\n\nBut Example 0's output is the last group (8s), which is the highest number. So that contradicts.\n\nThis is getting really tricky. Let's try to find another approach.\n\nLooking at the test input's groups:\n\nGroup 5 (8s) has arrays:\n\n[0,8,0], [8,0,8], [0,8,0].\n\nThese are all symmetric. The middle array is [8,0,8], which is symmetric. So all three are symmetric, and the number is 8. So according to Example 0's pattern, this would be the highest number group, so this should be the output.\n\nBut wait, in Example 2, there was a group with 8s but the output was 4s. So why was that?\n\nIn Example 2's input, the group with 8s was:\n\nFirst input array's fourth chunk: [8,0,0]\n\nSecond's fourth chunk: [0,8,8]\n\nThird's fourth chunk: [0,8,0]\n\nThese are not all symmetric. The first array's chunk [8,0,0] is not symmetric, so that group is invalid. Hence, the highest valid group is the 4s.\n\nSo the criteria is:\n\nFor each group of three arrays (chunks), check if all three arrays are symmetric (palindromic), and all have the same number (with zeros allowed). Among these, select the group with the highest number.\n\nIn the test input's groups:\n\nGroup 1: 5s arrays.\n\n[0,5,0] is symmetric.\n\n[5,0,5] is symmetric.\n\n[0,5,0] is symmetric. All three are symmetric. The number is 5.\n\nGroup 2: 3s. Same structure as group 1. All symmetric. Number 3.\n\nGroup 3: 6s.\n\nFirst array [6,0,6] is symmetric.\n\nSecond array [6,6,0] is not symmetric (reverse would be [0,6,6], which is different).\n\nThird array [6,0,6] is symmetric. So not all symmetric. Invalid.\n\nGroup 4:4s. All arrays are symmetric. Number 4.\n\nGroup 5:8s. All arrays are symmetric. Number 8.\n\nSo among these, group 5 has the highest number (8), so its three arrays would be the output.\n\nBut looking at the example outputs, when the group is all symmetric, the output is that group. For instance, Example 0's output is such a group with 8s, which are all symmetric.\n\nBut in the test input, group 5's arrays are:\n\n[0,8,0], [8,0,8], [0,8,0]. All are symmetric. So according to the pattern, this should be the output.\n\nBut wait, in Example 3's output, the group is:\n\n[0,7,7], [7,7,0], [7,0,7]. The first two arrays are not symmetric. Only the third is. So how does that fit?\n\nAh, maybe the criteria is different. Perhaps the group must form a specific pattern, such as the middle array being [x,0,x], and the first and third being [x,x,x], like in Example 0.\n\nBut in Example 3's output, the pattern is different. So perhaps there are multiple valid patterns.\n\nAlternatively, the pattern is that the group is a sequence of three arrays that form a diamond-like pattern when arranged vertically, with the middle array having the number in the middle, and the others around it. But this is getting too vague.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the valid groups are those where each array in the group has exactly two instances of the number and one zero, arranged symmetrically, and the middle array has the number in all positions. But this doesn't fit all examples.\n\nAlternatively, considering that in the output groups of the examples, the three arrays form a kind of vertical mirror or pattern. For instance:\n\nExample 0's output:\n\nRow 1: [8,8,8]\n\nRow 2: [8,0,8]\n\nRow 3: [8,8,8]\n\nThis forms a diamond shape with zero in the center.\n\nExample 1's output:\n\nRow 1: [7,0,7]\n\nRow 2: [0,7,0]\n\nRow 3: [7,0,7]\n\nForms a cross.\n\nExample 2's output:\n\nRow 1: [4,0,4]\n\nRow 2: [4,4,4]\n\nRow 3: [4,0,4]\n\nForms a vertical line in the middle.\n\nExample 3's output:\n\nRow 1: [0,7,7]\n\nRow 2: [7,7,0]\n\nRow 3: [7,0,7]\n\nThis forms a diagonal pattern.\n\nSo perhaps the pattern is that the output group is the one where the three arrays form a specific geometric pattern, and among those, select the one with the highest number.\n\nBut how to determine that programmatically.\n\nGiven the time constraints, I think the best approach is to look for groups where all three arrays are symmetric (palindromic) and have the same number. Among these, select the group with the highest number.\n\nIn the test input's case:\n\nGroup 5 (8s) has all symmetric arrays. Group 1 (5s), group 2 (3s), group 4 (4s), and group 5 (8s) meet this criterion. The highest number is 8. So the output should be group 5.\n\nBut let's look at the test input's group 5:\n\n[0,8,0]\n\n[8,0,8]\n\n[0,8,0]\n\nThese are all symmetric. So according to this pattern, the output should be these three arrays."
