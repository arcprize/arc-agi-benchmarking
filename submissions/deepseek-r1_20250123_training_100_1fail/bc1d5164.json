        "cot_1": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. So we have these input grids and output grids. The task is to see how the input is transformed into the output. Let's look at the examples one by one.\n\nStarting with Example 0. The input is a 5x7 grid. The output is a 3x3 grid. The first thing I notice is that the output is smaller. Maybe it's taking certain elements from the input. Let's compare the input and output.\n\nInput rows for Example 0:\nRow 0: [0,8,0,0,0,8,0]\nRow 1: [8,8,0,0,0,8,8]\nRow 2: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\nRow 3: [8,8,0,0,0,8,8]\nRow 4: [0,8,0,0,0,8,0]\n\nOutput is:\n[0,8,0]\n[8,8,8]\n[0,8,0]\n\nLooking at the output's middle element, which is 8. The input's middle row (row 2) is all zeros, so maybe the output's middle row is not taken directly. Alternatively, perhaps it's combining elements from the first and last rows and columns. Let's check.\n\nOutput row 0 is [0,8,0]. The input's first row has elements 0,8,0 (positions 0,1,6?) Wait, input rows have 7 elements. Let's see. For the first row of input, indexes 0 to 6. The output row 0 is 0,8,0. Hmm. The input's first row is [0,8,0,0,0,8,0]. The first element is 0, then 8 at position 1, then three zeros, then 8 at position 5, then 0. The output row 0 is 0,8,0. Maybe taking the first, third, and fifth elements? Wait, 0 (pos0), then 8 (pos1), then 0 (pos6). But that's positions 0,1,6. But the output is three elements, so maybe positions 0, 3, 6? No. Let's think differently.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is formed by taking the middle of the input. Wait, the input is 5 rows and 7 columns. The output is 3x3. Maybe the center of the input. For rows, the middle row is row 2. But in the output, the middle row isn't from row 2 of input. So that might not be.\n\nLooking at Example 0's output, the middle row is [8,8,8]. In the input, the middle row (row2) is all zeros, so that's not it. Then perhaps the output is taking elements from the first, middle, and last rows and columns. Wait, the input has 5 rows and 7 columns. The output is 3x3, so maybe taking rows 0, 2, 4 and columns 0, 3, 6? Let's check.\n\nFor Example 0:\n\nRow0: [0,8,0,0,0,8,0]. Columns 0,3,6: 0,0,0 \u2192 but output row0 is [0,8,0]. Hmm, that doesn't match. Alternatively, maybe taking columns 1,3,5. Row0: 8,0,8. Which would be [8,0,8], but the output is [0,8,0]. That doesn't fit either.\n\nWait, maybe the output is formed by combining certain elements from the input's surrounding rows. Let's see Example0's output:\n\nThe output's first row is [0,8,0]. Input row0 has 0,8,0,0,0,8,0. Maybe taking the first, middle, and last elements of each row? But for row0, first is 0, middle (index3) is 0, last is 0. But the output's first row is [0,8,0], which doesn't match.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is constructed by taking the first, third, and fifth rows (since there are 5 input rows, indexes 0,2,4) and the first, fourth, and seventh columns (columns 0,3,6). Let's check.\n\nExample0 input:\n\nRows 0,2,4:\n\nRow0: [0,8,0,0,0,8,0]\nRow2: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\nRow4: [0,8,0,0,0,8,0]\n\nColumns 0,3,6:\n\nRow0: 0,0,0 \u2192 output row0 is [0,8,0], which doesn't match. Hmm, that's not right.\n\nWait, maybe the output is a 3x3 grid where each element is taken from the input's rows and columns in a specific way. Let's look at the output positions:\n\nFor Example0's output:\n\nRow0: [0,8,0]\nRow1: [8,8,8]\nRow2: [0,8,0]\n\nLooking at the input, the middle element (1,3) in input is part of row1 and column3. But the input's row1 is [8,8,0,0,0,8,8], so column3 is 0. But output's middle is 8. So that's not directly taking the center.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is created by overlaying certain patterns. For instance, in Example0's output, the middle row is all 8s, and the first and third rows have 8s in the middle. Looking at the input, perhaps the 8s are from the corners of the input. Wait, input rows 0 and 4 have 8s at positions 1 and 5. For example, row0 has 8 at index1 and 5. Row1 has 8s at 0,1,5,6. Row3 is same as row1. Row4 same as row0.\n\nSo the output for Example0 is a diamond shape. The middle of the output is all 8s, surrounded by 0s. Maybe the output is a kind of cross or diamond pattern, where the non-zero elements are taken from the input's non-zero elements that form a certain structure.\n\nAnother approach: looking at the positions of non-zero elements in the input and how they map to the output.\n\nIn Example0's input:\n\nRow0: non-zero at 1 and 5 (8s)\nRow1: non-zero at 0,1,5,6\nRow3: same as row1\nRow4: same as row0\n\nSo the input has a symmetrical pattern. The output has non-zero elements forming a cross. So perhaps the output is constructed by taking the non-zero elements that are in positions that form a cross in the input, but how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is a 3x3 grid where each cell is the sum or presence of certain elements from the input. For example, the output's (0,0) is 0. In the input, perhaps (0,0) is 0, (0,6) is 0, (4,0) is 0, (4,6) is 0. So maybe the four corners of the input are summed or something. But that doesn't directly explain the output.\n\nWait, looking at the output's first row in Example0: 0,8,0. The input's first row has 8s at positions 1 and 5. The output's first row middle is 8. Maybe the output's middle column is the middle of the input's rows. But the input has 7 columns, so the middle is column 3. But in Example0's output, the middle element is 8. But in input row0, column3 is 0. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each output row is formed by taking the first, middle, and last elements of each input row. For Example0's input row0: first is 0, middle (3rd element) is 0, last is 0 \u2192 output row0 would be [0,0,0], but actual output is [0,8,0]. So that's not it.\n\nLet's look at another example. Example1's input:\n\nInput:\n[2,2,0,0,0,2,2]\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,2]\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n[0,2,0,0,0,2,0]\n[2,0,0,0,0,0,2]\n\nOutput:\n[2,2,2]\n[0,2,2]\n[2,0,2]\n\nHmm. Output is 3 rows. Let's see how the input maps. The output has 2s in various positions. The input's first row has 2s at 0,1,5,6. Second row has 2 at 6. Fourth row (index3) has 2s at 1 and 5. Fifth row (index4) has 2s at 0 and 6.\n\nThe output's first row is [2,2,2]. Where does this come from? Input's first row's first three 2s? Or maybe it's combining elements from different rows. For example, output row0 could be combining the first elements of row0, row0's 5th element (which is 2), and row0's 6th (2). But that's 2,2,2. But how does that get into the output's first row as [2,2,2]? Maybe.\n\nThe output's row1 is [0,2,2]. Maybe from row1's elements. Input row1 has a 2 at position6. But output row1 has 0,2,2. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output's rows correspond to certain rows of the input. For example, output row0 could be the first non-zero elements from input rows 0, 1, and 4. But not sure.\n\nAnother approach: maybe the output is the result of some symmetry or transformation. For example, in Example0's input, the output is a diamond shape. Maybe the output is a 3x3 grid that represents the central part of some transformation of the input.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each cell in the output is determined by the presence of the same number in certain positions of the input. For example, in the output's (0,0) position, maybe it's the value from the input's (0,0), (0,6), (4,0), (4,6) positions. Let's check Example0. Input (0,0) is 0, (0,6) is 0, (4,0) is 0, (4,6) is 0. So output (0,0) is 0. That matches. For (0,1) in output: maybe it's input's (0,1), (0,5), (4,1), (4,5). Example0's input has 8s at (0,1) and (0,5), and (4,1) and (4,5) are 8s. So sum or presence. If it's any non-zero, then output (0,1) would be 8, which matches. Similarly, output (0,2) would be (0,6) which is 0. But wait, output (0,2) is 0, which matches. Then output row0 would be [0,8,0], which is correct. Then output (1,0): maybe input (1,0), (1,6), (3,0), (3,6). In Example0, those positions are 8,8,8,8. So sum would be 8+8+8+8=32, but output is 8. So maybe if any of them are non-zero, take the value. So 8. So output (1,0) is 8. Output row1 is [8,8,8]. Middle (1,1) could be input (2,3), which is 0, but output is 8. Hmm, that's conflicting. So perhaps that's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by considering the four corners of each possible 3x3 section in the input. But given that the input is 5x7 and the output is 3x3, perhaps it's a specific way of combining elements.\n\nAnother idea: the output is 3x3, which is the same as the number of rows (5 rows) but maybe taking the first, middle, and last rows (rows 0, 2, 4) and columns 0, 3, 6. Let's check Example0:\n\nRows 0,2,4:\n\nRow0: [0,8,0,0,0,8,0]\nRow2: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\nRow4: [0,8,0,0,0,8,0]\n\nColumns 0,3,6:\n\nRow0: 0,0,0 \u2192 [0,0,0]\nRow2: 0,0,0 \u2192 [0,0,0]\nRow4: 0,0,0 \u2192 [0,0,0]\n\nBut the output for Example0 is different. So that's not it.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output's rows correspond to input rows 0,1,4. Let's see for Example0:\n\nRow0: [0,8,0,0,0,8,0]\nRow1: [8,8,0,0,0,8,8]\nRow4: [0,8,0,0,0,8,0]\n\nTaking columns 1,3,5 from these rows:\n\nRow0: 8 (col1), 0 (col3), 8 (col5) \u2192 [8,0,8]\nRow1: 8,0,8 \u2192 [8,0,8]\nRow4:8,0,8 \u2192 [8,0,8]\n\nBut output rows are [0,8,0], [8,8,8], [0,8,0]. Doesn't match.\n\nHmm. Let's think differently. Maybe each output cell is the sum of certain cells in the input. For example, the output cell (i,j) is the sum of input cells (i*2, j*2), but scaled. Let's see:\n\nOutput is 3x3, so i and j can be 0,1,2.\n\nFor Example0:\n\noutput (0,0) \u2192 input (0,0) =0\n\noutput (0,1) \u2192 input (0,2) =0? But the output is 8 here. So no.\n\nAnother approach: perhaps the output is the result of overlaying the top, middle, and bottom rows of the input in a certain way. For Example0, the top row (row0) has 0,8,0... etc. The bottom row (row4) is similar. Maybe taking the maximum value from corresponding positions in row0, row1, row3, row4 (excluding row2, which is all zeros). For example, the middle of the output could be the maximum of the middle positions of the input's non-zero rows.\n\nBut how to map this into 3x3.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking the first three elements of the first row, the middle three elements of the second row, and the last three elements of the last row. Not sure.\n\nWait, looking at Example0's output:\n\n[0,8,0]\n[8,8,8]\n[0,8,0]\n\nThis looks like a diamond shape. The input's non-zero elements form a diamond as well. The input's 8s are arranged in a diamond pattern. The output is a smaller diamond. So perhaps the output is a condensed version of the input's pattern.\n\nAnother thought: the input has 5 rows and 7 columns, and the output is 3x3. Maybe each row in the output is a combination of three rows from the input. For example, output row0 is formed by combining input rows 0 and 1. But how?\n\nAlternatively, considering that the input is symmetrical, maybe the output is the central part of the input after some transformation. For instance, the input is mirrored both horizontally and vertically, and the output takes the central 3x3 part. But Example0's input is symmetrical, but the output is 3x3, which would require the input to have a 3x3 center. However, the input is 5x7, so the exact center is row2 (third row) and column3 (fourth column). So taking 3x3 around that: rows 1 to 3, columns 2 to 4. Let's check:\n\nExample0's input rows 1-3:\n\nRow1: [8,8,0,0,0,8,8]\nRow2: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\nRow3: [8,8,0,0,0,8,8]\n\nColumns 2-4: positions 2,3,4.\n\nSo for rows 1-3 and columns 2-4:\n\nRow1: 0,0,0 \u2192 [0,0,0]\nRow2: 0,0,0 \u2192 [0,0,0]\nRow3:0,0,0 \u2192 [0,0,0]\n\nWhich doesn't match the output. So that's not it.\n\nLet's look at another example. Example1's input:\n\nInput rows:\n0: [2,2,0,0,0,2,2]\n1: [0,0,0,0,0,0,2]\n2: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n3: [0,2,0,0,0,2,0]\n4: [2,0,0,0,0,0,2]\n\nOutput is:\n[2,2,2]\n[0,2,2]\n[2,0,2]\n\nLooking at output row0: [2,2,2]. Where do these come from? Input row0 has 2s at 0,1,5,6. If output row0 is taking elements from input rows 0 and 1. Maybe the first element of output row0 is the first element of input row0 (2), the middle is row0's 5th element (2), and the third is row1's 6th element (2). So that gives 2,2,2. That fits. Then output row1: [0,2,2]. Maybe the first element is row3's 1st element (2?), but output is 0. Hmm. Alternatively, output row1 could be from input row3. Row3: [0,2,0,0,0,2,0]. Taking elements 0,3,6: 0,0,0. That doesn't fit. Alternatively, maybe output row1 is from input row2 (all zeros) and some other rows.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is constructed by taking the first element from the first row, the fifth element from the first row, and the sixth element from the second row for the first output row. Then the second output row could be elements from the third and fourth rows. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each column of the output is derived from certain columns of the input. For example, output column0 could be input columns 0 and 4's elements. Not sure.\n\nLet's think of another approach. The input grids have varying numbers, but the outputs are 3x3. The key may be to look at the positions of the numbers in the input and how they translate to the output. Let's consider that the output is a 3x3 grid where each cell (i,j) is determined by the presence of a number in certain positions in the input. For example:\n\n- The top-left corner of the output (0,0) might be determined by the input's first element of the first row, the first element of the last row, or some combination.\n- The middle cell (1,1) could be the center of the input.\n\nBut in Example0, the input's center is 0, but the output's center is 8. So that's not directly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output's cells are the sum of the four corners of specific regions in the input. For example, each output cell is the sum of four elements from the input. Let's see for Example0's output cell (0,0). Maybe it's the sum of input's (0,0), (0,6), (4,0), (4,6), which are all 0, so sum is 0. Which matches. Output cell (0,1) could be sum of input's (0,1), (0,5), (4,1), (4,5). For Example0, these are all 8s, sum would be 32, but output is 8. So that's not possible. Unless it's an average, but 32/4=8. Oh! That's a possibility. Let's check:\n\nExample0's output (0,1) would be (8 +8 +8 +8)/4=8. So 8. Which matches. Similarly, output (0,2) is (0 +0 +0 +0)/4=0. So the first row of output would be [0,8,0], which matches.\n\nThen output (1,0): sum of input's (1,0), (1,6), (3,0), (3,6). For Example0, these are 8,8,8,8. Sum is 32/4=8. Which matches output's [8,8,8] in row1.\n\nMiddle cell (1,1): sum of input's (1,3), (2,3), (3,3), (2,3) again? Or maybe input's (1,1), (1,5), (3,1), (3,5). For Example0: 8,8,8,8 \u2192 32/4=8. So output (1,1) is 8. Which fits.\n\nOutput (1,2): sum of input's (1,6), (1,2), (3,6), (3,2). For Example0, 8,0,8,0 \u2192 sum 16/4=4. But output (1,2) is 8. So that doesn't fit. Wait, Example0's output (1,2) is 8. So this approach may not be correct.\n\nWait, maybe it's not the average but the maximum value in those positions. For Example0's output (1,2), the positions would be (1,6), (1,2), (3,6), (3,2). The values are 8,0,8,0. Max is 8. So output is 8. That works. For Example0's output cell (0,1), the positions would be (0,1), (0,5), (4,1), (4,5). All are 8. Max is 8. So output is 8.\n\nOutput cell (1,1) would be positions (1,1), (1,5), (3,1), (3,5). All 8s. Max is 8. Which fits.\n\nOutput cell (1,2): positions (1,6), (1,5), (3,6), (3,5). Example0's input row1 has 8 at 6 and 5. So values are 8,8,8,8. Max is 8. So output (1,2) is 8. Which matches.\n\nThis seems to work for Example0. Let's test this hypothesis with Example1.\n\nExample1's input:\n\nRow0: [2,2,0,0,0,2,2]\nRow1: [0,0,0,0,0,0,2]\nRow2: all zeros\nRow3: [0,2,0,0,0,2,0]\nRow4: [2,0,0,0,0,0,2]\n\nOutput:\n[2,2,2]\n[0,2,2]\n[2,0,2]\n\nLet's apply the rule: each output cell (i,j) is the maximum of four positions in the input. Which four positions?\n\nFor output cell (i,j), the four positions would be:\n\n- (i', j') where i' and j' are determined based on i and j. Need to figure out the mapping.\n\nWait, in Example0, for output (0,0):\n\nInput positions (0,0), (0,6), (4,0), (4,6). All zeros \u2192 max 0.\n\nOutput (0,0) is 0. Correct.\n\nOutput (0,1) is (0,1), (0,5), (4,1), (4,5). For Example0, those are 8,8,8,8 \u2192 max 8.\n\nFor Example1's output (0,0):\n\nInput positions (0,0) =2, (0,6)=2, (4,0)=2, (4,6)=2. Max is 2. So output (0,0) is 2. Which matches.\n\nOutput (0,1): input positions (0,1)=2, (0,5)=2, (4,1)=0, (4,5)=0. Max is 2. Output (0,1) is 2. Correct.\n\nOutput (0,2): positions (0,6)=2, (0, something?), wait, perhaps the four positions for output (i,j) are as follows:\n\nFor each output cell (i,j), the four input cells are:\n\n- (i, j*2)\n- (i, j*2 +1)\n- (5-1 -i, j*2)\n- (5-1 -i, j*2 +1)\n\nWait, that might be a stretch, but let's think.\n\nAlternatively, the four positions are:\n\nFor output cell (i,j), take the input's row i, column 2j, and row 4-i, column 2j and 2j+1?\n\nHmm, maybe not. Alternatively, the output's columns correspond to pairs of columns in the input. For example, output column 0 corresponds to input columns 0 and 1, output column 1 to input columns 3 and 4, output column 2 to input columns 5 and 6. Then, for each output cell, take the maximum value from those pairs in certain rows.\n\nAlternatively, considering that the input has 7 columns and the output has 3, perhaps each output column represents two input columns, except the middle one which is the central column. For example:\n\nOutput columns:\n\n0 \u2192 input columns 0 and 1\n\n1 \u2192 input column 3 (center)\n\n2 \u2192 input columns 5 and 6\n\nThen for each output row (0,1,2), which could be input rows 0, 2, 4.\n\nWait, let's check Example0's output:\n\nInput row0, columns 0 and 1: 0 and 8 \u2192 max is 8, but output row0, column0 is 0. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output rows are the first, third, and fifth rows (0,2,4) of the input, and the columns are the first, fourth, and seventh (0,3,6). For Example0, that would be:\n\nRow0: 0 (col0), 0 (col3), 0 (col6) \u2192 [0,0,0], but output row0 is [0,8,0]. Doesn't fit.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Let's go back to the hypothesis where each output cell is the maximum of four specific input cells. For Example0, that worked. Let's test this for Example1.\n\nExample1's output cell (0,2) is 2. The four input cells would be:\n\nWhich positions? Let's assume the same mapping as Example0: for output cell (i,j), the four positions are (i, 2j), (i, 2j+1), (4-i, 2j), (4-i, 2j+1). Let's see:\n\nFor output cell (0,0):\n\ni=0, j=0. Input positions (0,0), (0,1), (4,0), (4,1). Values 2,2,2,0. Max is 2. Which matches output (0,0).\n\nOutput cell (0,1):\n\nj=1. Positions (0,2), (0,3), (4,2), (4,3). Values 0,0,0,0. Max is 0. But output (0,1) is 2. So this doesn't work.\n\nHmm. Maybe the columns are different. Alternatively, maybe for j in output, the columns are 0: columns 0 and 6 of input; 1: columns 1 and 5; 2: columns 2 and 4? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the four positions for output cell (i,j) are (i, j*2), (i, j*2 + 1), (4-i, j*2), (4-i, j*2 +1).\n\nLet's test for Example0's output (0,1):\n\ni=0, j=1. Columns 2 and 3. Input row0, columns 2 and 3: 0 and 0. Input row4 (4-i=4-0=4), columns 2 and 3: 0 and 0. So max is 0. But output is 8. Doesn't fit.\n\nThis approach isn't working. Let's think again.\n\nAnother idea: the output's each row is formed by combining certain elements from three input rows. For instance, output row0 is a combination of input rows 0 and 1, row1 combines rows 1 and 3, and row2 combines rows3 and4.\n\nAlternatively, looking at Example1's output row2: [2,0,2]. Input row4 has 2s at 0 and 6. Maybe output row2 takes elements from row4's 0,3,6. Row4's 0 is 2, 3 is 0,6 is 2. So [2,0,2], which matches the output's row2.\n\nSo maybe for output row2, take elements from input row4's columns 0,3,6.\n\nOutput row0 for Example1 is [2,2,2]. Input row0's columns 0,3,6 are 2,0,2. Which would be [2,0,2], but output is [2,2,2]. So that's not matching.\n\nAlternatively, take columns 0,5,6 for row0. Input row0: columns0 is 2, 5 is2, 6 is2 \u2192 [2,2,2]. Which matches. Output row0: [2,2,2]. Then output row1: [0,2,2]. Let's check input row1's columns0,5,6: 0,0,2 \u2192 [0,0,2], which doesn't match. But output row1 is [0,2,2]. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, output row0 takes input row0's columns0,3,6. But for Example1's row0, that's 2,0,2 \u2192 [2,0,2], but output row0 is [2,2,2]. Doesn't fit.\n\nAnother observation: in the output of Example0, the middle row is all 8s, which corresponds to the input's rows 1 and 3, which have 8s in their first and last elements. Maybe the middle row of the output is formed by taking the middle elements of the input's rows 1 and 3. For Example0's row1 and row3: [8,8,0,0,0,8,8]. The middle elements (columns 3) are 0, but output's middle row is all 8s. So that doesn't work.\n\nWait, in Example0's output, the middle row is [8,8,8]. Perhaps these are the values from the input's rows 1 and 3, but their first and last elements. For row1: 8,8 (first and last). For row3: same. So maybe the middle row of the output is combining these.\n\nAlternatively, the output's middle row is formed by the first element of row1, the middle of row2 (which is zero), and the last element of row1. But that doesn't explain the 8s.\n\nLet's try another angle. For each example, the output has the same number as the input. For example, Example0 has 8s, output has 8s. Example1 has 2s, output has 2s. So the pattern is about the positions of the numbers, not their values.\n\nLooking at the output dimensions: input is 5x7, output is 3x3. So perhaps it's a matter of selecting certain rows and columns. Let's see:\n\nFor rows, maybe select rows 0, 2, 4 (the first, middle, and last). For columns, select columns 0, 3, 6 (first, middle, last).\n\nFor Example0:\n\nRows 0,2,4:\n\nRow0: [0,8,0,0,0,8,0] \u2192 columns0,3,6: 0,0,0 \u2192 [0,0,0]\n\nRow2: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0] \u2192 [0,0,0]\n\nRow4: [0,8,0,0,0,8,0] \u2192 [0,0,0]\n\nSo the output would be all zeros, but Example0's output has 8s. So this doesn't work.\n\nAnother approach: perhaps the output is created by looking for the positions where the same number appears in symmetric positions in the input. For example, in Example0's input, 8 appears in symmetric positions around the center. The output captures these symmetric occurrences.\n\nFor example, in Example0's input, the 8s are arranged symmetrically in the first and last rows, and in the second and fourth rows. The output might be the central 3x3 where these symmetries are condensed.\n\nAlternatively, the output could be formed by taking elements from the input where their reflection across the center is also the same. For instance, for each position (i,j) in the output, check if the corresponding positions in the input (mirroring) have the same value and retain it.\n\nBut how to map this into 3x3.\n\nAnother observation: the output's rows are constructed by taking elements from the input's rows in a specific pattern. For example, in Example0's output:\n\nRow0: [0,8,0] \u2192 could be input row0's element 1 (8), and others from row4.\n\nWait, but row4's element 1 is also 8.\n\nAlternatively, output row0 is input row0's elements 1, 3, 5. But row0's elements 1 is 8, 3 is 0, 5 is 8. That would be [8,0,8], but the output row0 is [0,8,0]. Doesn't match.\n\nAlternatively, output row0 is the elements from input row0's first element (0), input row1's first element (8), and input row1's last element (8). But that gives 0,8,8 which doesn't match.\n\nThis is getting tricky. Let's look at another example. Example3's input is:\n\nInput:\n[4,0,0,0,0,0,4]\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n[4,0,0,0,0,4,4]\n\nOutput:\n[4,0,4]\n[0,0,0]\n[4,4,4]\n\nSo the output has 4s. Let's see how this might be formed. The input's first row has 4s at 0 and 6. The last row has 4s at 0,5,6.\n\nOutput row0: [4,0,4]. Maybe this comes from input's first row's 0 and 6 (4 and 4), and something else. But output has three elements. If it's input row0's 0,3,6: 4,0,4 \u2192 which would be [4,0,4], which matches. Output row0. Then output row2: [4,4,4]. Input row4's 0,3,6: 4,0,4 \u2192 but output is [4,4,4]. So maybe row4's 5 and 6. Input row4's 5 is4, 6 is4. So maybe columns 5 and 6, but how to get three elements.\n\nAlternatively, output row0 is input row0's columns0,3,6 \u2192 [4,0,4], which matches. Output row2 is input row4's columns0,3,6 \u2192 [4,0,4], but output row2 is [4,4,4]. So that doesn't fit. Unless for row4, columns0,5,6: 4,4,4. Which would give [4,4,4] for output row2, which matches. So maybe the output rows are:\n\nRow0: input row0's columns0,3,6 \u2192 [4,0,4]\n\nRow1: input row2's columns0,3,6 \u2192 [0,0,0]\n\nRow2: input row4's columns0,5,6 \u2192 [4,4,4]\n\nBut why for row4 take columns0,5,6 instead of 0,3,6? Because row4's 5 and 6 are 4s. So maybe for each output row i:\n\n- For row0: input row0, columns0,3,6\n\n- For row1: input row2, columns0,3,6\n\n- For row2: input row4, columns0,5,6\n\nBut why? Let's check other examples.\n\nExample0's input:\n\nRow0: [0,8,0,0,0,8,0]\n\ncolumns0,3,6 \u2192 0,0,0 \u2192 output row0 is [0,8,0]. Doesn't match. So this hypothesis is incorrect.\n\nBut in Example3, this approach works for rows0 and2. So maybe there's a different pattern.\n\nAnother idea: the output row0 is formed by input row0's first element, middle element (index3), and last element. Output row1 is input row2's first, middle, last. Output row2 is input row4's first, middle, last.\n\nExample3's input row0: first is4, middle is0, last is4 \u2192 [4,0,4], which matches output row0. Input row2: all zeros \u2192 [0,0,0], matches output row1. Input row4: first is4, middle (index3) is0, last is4. But output row2 is [4,4,4]. So that doesn't fit. So maybe for row4, it's taking first, fifth, sixth elements. 4,0,4. No. But output row2 for Example3 is [4,4,4]. Input row4's fifth element is4, sixth is4. So maybe columns0,5,6. Which would be4,4,4. That fits. So why would for row0 and row4, take different columns?\n\nAlternatively, maybe for the last row (row4), instead of column3, take column5. So output row0: row0's 0,3,6. Output row2: row4's 0,5,6. For Example3, that gives row0:4,0,4; row2:4,4,4. Which matches. But why?\n\nMaybe the columns depend on the row. For rows 0 and4, columns 0,3,6 and 0,5,6 respectively. But what determines this?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output columns are 0,3,6 for input rows 0 and4, but for row4, there's an exception if the middle element (3) is zero. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output for row2 is formed by the first non-zero element in row4. But in Example3's row4, the first non-zero is4, then fifth and sixth are4s.\n\nThis is getting too example-specific. Let's look for a general pattern.\n\nAlternative approach: The output is a 3x3 grid where each cell is the value from the input's cell that is mirrored across the vertical and horizontal axes. For example, the output's (0,0) is the value from the input's (0,0) and (0,6), (4,0), and (4,6). If all are the same, take that value. If there's a non-zero, take it. For Example0, all those positions are0, so output (0,0) is0. For output (0,1), input's (0,1) and (0,5) and (4,1) and (4,5) are all8s, so output is8. This seems to fit.\n\nThen for output cell (i,j), we take the maximum of the four mirrored positions in the input.\n\nLet's test this with Example1:\n\nOutput cell (1,1):\n\nMirrored positions would be (1,3) (since output cell (1,1) is the center), but wait, the input has 7 columns. So the mirrored positions for output cell (i,j) would need to be determined.\n\nAlternatively, for each output cell (i,j), the input cells considered are:\n\n- (i, j*2 +0)\n\n- (i, j*2 +1)\n\n- (4 -i, j*2 +0)\n\n- (4 -i, j*2 +1)\n\nThen take the maximum of these four.\n\nLet's check this:\n\nExample0's output (0,0):\n\ni=0, j=0. Input cells (0,0), (0,1), (4,0), (4,1). Values 0,8,0,8. Max is8. But output (0,0) is0. So this doesn't work.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternatively, for each output cell (i,j), the input cells are:\n\n- input_row = i*2\n\n- input_col = j*2\n\nBut that might not fit.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output cell (i,j) corresponds to the input's cell (i*2, j*2). But for Example0's output (0,1), input cell (0, 2) is0. Output is8. So that's not.\n\nAnother idea: the output is formed by taking the middle three elements from the first, middle, and last rows of the input. For example, each output row is the middle three elements of input rows 0, 2, 4.\n\nBut the input has 7 elements per row. The middle three would be positions 2,3,4. For Example0:\n\nInput row0: [0,8,0,0,0,8,0] \u2192 middle three:0,0,0. Output row0 is [0,8,0]. Doesn't match.\n\nSo that's not it.\n\nAnother approach: The output seems to capture the non-zero elements in a certain way. For Example0's input, the non-zero elements form a diamond shape. The output captures this diamond in a 3x3 grid. Similarly, other examples have outputs that form various shapes with the numbers.\n\nBut how to translate the 5x7 input into a 3x3 output. Maybe it's a matter of overlapping certain regions. For instance, each output cell is the maximum of a 3x3 region in the input. For example, the output cell (0,0) is the maximum of input's rows0-2 and columns0-2. Output cell (0,1) is rows0-2 and columns2-4. Output cell (0,2) is rows0-2 and columns4-6. Then similarly for other rows. But Example0's output (0,0) would be max of input's top-left 3x3:\n\nRow0:0,8,0\n\nRow1:8,8,0\n\nRow2:0,0,0\n\nMax is8. Output (0,0) is0. Doesn't fit.\n\nThis is frustrating. Let's try to find another pattern. Looking at the examples:\n\nIn Example0's output, the middle row is all 8s. The input's rows1 and3 have 8s in the first and last positions. So maybe the middle row of the output is formed by combining the first elements of row1 and row3, and the last elements of row1 and row3. So for output row1: [8,8,8]. Maybe the first element is row1's first element (8), the middle is row1's middle (0) but output is8. Doesn't fit.\n\nAlternative idea: The output's rows are the first three elements of the input's rows0, 2, and4. But in Example0, row0's first three are0,8,0. Row2's first three are0,0,0. Row4's first three are0,8,0. Output would be:\n\n[0,8,0]\n\n[0,0,0]\n\n[0,8,0]\n\nBut Example0's output has a middle row of8s. So no.\n\nAnother observation: In Example0, the output's middle row is [8,8,8]. The input's rows1 and3 have 8s at the start and end. Perhaps the output's middle row combines the first and last elements of rows1 and3, and the middle is from the center of row2 (but it's zero). So not.\n\nLet's think outside the box. Maybe the output is a result of some kind of convolution or pattern matching. For example, each output cell is the sum of the input's cells in a certain pattern around it. For example, a cross shape.\n\nBut with the time I've spent and not finding a clear pattern, perhaps I should look for a pattern in the examples' inputs and outputs.\n\nAnother approach: Each output cell corresponds to the number of times a certain pattern appears in the input. For example, in Example0, the output's 8s are in positions where the input has 8s in symmetric positions.\n\nAlternatively, the output is formed by taking the first element of each input row, then the middle element, then the last element. But for Example0's input:\n\nRow0:0,0,0 \u2192 output row0 is0,8,0. Doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, for each output row, take the first non-zero element, the middle non-zero element, and the last non-zero element of the corresponding input row. For Example0's row0: 8 and 8 are non-zero. But output row0 has three elements. Not sure.\n\nLet's look at Example4's input and output:\n\nInput:\n[0,3,0,0,0,3,0]\n[3,0,0,0,0,0,3]\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,3]\n\nOutput:\n[0,3,0]\n[3,0,3]\n[0,0,3]\n\nHmm. Output row0 is [0,3,0]. Input row0 has 3s at positions1 and5. Output row1 is [3,0,3]. Input row1 has 3s at0 and6. Output row2 is [0,0,3]. Input row4 has 3 at6.\n\nSo perhaps output row0 is the first, third, and fifth elements of input row0. For Example4's input row0: 0 (0),0 (3rd),3 (5th) \u2192 [0,0,3], but output is [0,3,0]. Doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, output row0 corresponds to the non-zero elements in input row0. But row0 has 3s at positions1 and5, which would be [3,3], but output row0 has three elements. Not matching.\n\nAnother idea: the output is formed by taking the non-zero elements from the input's first row, then the non-zero elements from the second row, etc., and arranging them into a 3x3 grid. But Example0's input has 8s in multiple rows, but the output is 3x3. The number of non-zero elements would have to fit into 3x3, which might not always be the case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is constructed by taking elements from the input where their positions are mirrored both horizontally and vertically. For example, output cell (0,0) is the value from input cell (0,0), (0,6), (4,0), (4,6), whichever is non-zero. If there are multiple non-zero values, pick the first one or the maximum.\n\nFor Example0's output (0,0): all four positions are 0 \u2192 0. Output (0,1): positions (0,1), (0,5), (4,1), (4,5) are all8 \u2192 8. Output (0,2): (0,2), (0,4), (4,2), (4,4) are 0 \u2192 0. So row0 becomes [0,8,0], which matches.\n\nFor output (1,0): positions (1,0), (1,6), (3,0), (3,6) are8,8,8,8 \u2192 max is8. Output is8. Similarly for (1,1), positions (1,3), (3,3), (1,3), (3,3) are0. But output (1,1) is8. So that doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. So this works for some cells but not others. Maybe the middle cell (1,1) is taking the value from the input's center (row2, column3) which is0. But output (1,1) in Example0 is8. So that's not.\n\nWait, perhaps the output's middle cell is taking the maximum of the input's four corners: (0,0), (0,6), (4,0), (4,6). For Example0, all zeros. No. Doesn't fit.\n\nThis is challenging. Let's try to find a pattern in the output's elements based on their positions.\n\nLooking at Example0's output:\n\n[0,8,0]\n\n[8,8,8]\n\n[0,8,0]\n\nThis is a diamond pattern. Example1's output is:\n\n[2,2,2]\n\n[0,2,2]\n\n[2,0,2]\n\nExample2's output:\n\n[4,4,0]\n\n[0,4,4]\n\n[4,0,4]\n\nExample3's output:\n\n[4,0,4]\n\n[0,0,0]\n\n[4,4,4]\n\nExample4's output:\n\n[0,3,0]\n\n[3,0,3]\n\n[0,0,3]\n\nThe outputs seem to have the same number as the input's non-zero elements. The pattern seems to be that each output cell is the value of the first occurrence of a non-zero element when looking at certain positions in the input, perhaps in a spiral or specific order.\n\nAlternatively, the output could be formed by taking the first three non-zero elements from certain parts of the input, but the arrangement varies.\n\nAnother approach: the output's rows are formed by the first three non-zero elements from the input's rows. For Example0's input:\n\nRow0: 8,8 (positions1 and5)\n\nRow1: 8,8,8,8\n\nRow2: all zeros\n\nRow3: same as row1\n\nRow4: same as row0\n\nBut the output for Example0 has three elements per row, which would require three non-zero elements. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAnother observation: the number of non-zero elements in the output is equal to the number of non-zero elements in the input. For Example0's input, there are 8 non-zero 8s. The output has 5 non-zero elements. Doesn't match.\n\nAlternatively, the output's non-zero elements are arranged in a way that mirrors the input's structure. For example, the input's non-zero elements form a pattern that is condensed into a 3x3 grid.\n\nPerhaps the output is a 3x3 grid where each cell corresponds to a quadrant or section of the input. For example, the top-left cell of the output corresponds to the top-left section of the input. But the input is 5x7, which doesn't divide evenly into 3 sections.\n\nAlternatively, the output cells correspond to the following input regions:\n\n- Top-left output cell: input rows0-1 and columns0-2\n\n- Top-middle: input rows0-1 and columns3-4\n\n- Top-right: input rows0-1 and columns5-6\n\n- Middle-left: input row2 and columns0-2\n\n- etc. But this is just speculation.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and not finding a clear pattern, perhaps I should look for another approach. Let's consider that each output cell is the maximum of certain cells in the input, possibly based on their position.\n\nFor example, in Example0's output:\n\n(0,0): 0\n\n(0,1):8\n\n(0,2):0\n\n(1,0):8\n\n(1,1):8\n\n(1,2):8\n\n(2,0):0\n\n(2,1):8\n\n(2,2):0\n\nThe input's non-zero cells are in positions that are symmetric around the center. For example, the output's (0,1) corresponds to input's (0,1) and (0,5), which are both8. Similarly, (1,0) corresponds to (1,0) and (3,0), which are8. (1,1) corresponds to (1,1) and (3,5), etc. So perhaps each output cell (i,j) is the maximum of input cells (i, j'), where j' is symmetric around the center of the input's row.\n\nFor example, each output row i corresponds to input row i and 4 -i (mirroring over the vertical axis). For each output cell j in row i, it corresponds to input columns j' and (6 - j') (mirroring over the horizontal axis).\n\nSo for output cell (i,j):\n\nInput cells considered are (i, j*2) and (i, j*2 +1), and (4 -i, j*2) and (4 -i, j*2 +1).\n\nThen take the maximum of these four cells.\n\nLet's test this hypothesis.\n\nExample0's output cell (0,0):\n\nj*2 =0, j*2+1=1. Input cells:\n\ni=0: (0,0)=0, (0,1)=8\n\n4 -i=4: (4,0)=0, (4,1)=8\n\nMax of 0,8,0,8 \u21928. But output cell (0,0) is0. So this doesn't work.\n\nHmm. This approach doesn't fit.\n\nAlternative idea: Maybe the output is created by taking the first three elements of the first row, the middle three elements of the third row, and the last three elements of the fifth row. But this doesn't fit.\n\nAnother observation: The output for Example0 has the same pattern as the input's rows0,1,3,4, but condensed. The input's rows0 and4 have 8s in positions1 and5. Rows1 and3 have 8s in positions0,1,5,6. The output's rows0 and2 have 8s in the middle, and row1 has all8s. So the output is a condensed version of the input's diamond pattern.\n\nSimilarly, in Example1's input, the output's first row is 2s all around, which could be from the input's first row's multiple 2s, and other rows contribute to the output's other rows.\n\nBut how to systematically condense this.\n\nPerhaps the output is formed by taking for each of the three output rows:\n\n- Row0: input row0's elements1 and5, and row1's element6.\n\n- Row1: input row1's element0, row2's element3 (which is0), row3's element6.\n\n- Row2: input row3's element5, row4's elements0 and6.\n\nBut this is getting too example-specific.\n\nGiven that I'm struggling, perhaps I should look for a pattern where each output row is constructed from the input rows in a specific way, such as:\n\nOutput row0: input row0's elements1, input row1's element0, and input row1's element6.\n\nFor Example0's output row0: 8 (row0's element1), 8 (row1's element0), 8 (row1's element6) \u2192 but output row0 is [0,8,0]. Doesn't fit.\n\nAnother idea: The output is the result of combining the first and last rows of the input in some way. For Example0's input, first and last rows are similar. Maybe output row0 is the first row's elements1,3,5. For row0: 8,0,8 \u2192 [8,0,8], but output row0 is [0,8,0]. No.\n\nAlternatively, output row0 is the first row's elements0,3,6: 0,0,0 \u2192 [0,0,0]. Doesn't match.\n\nAt this point, I think the pattern is that each cell in the output is the maximum value among four specific cells in the input: the cell itself, its horizontal mirror, its vertical mirror, and both. For example, for output cell (i,j), the input cells considered are (i,j), (i, 6-j), (4-i,j), (4-i,6-j). Then take the maximum of these four.\n\nLet's test this:\n\nExample0's output cell (0,0):\n\nInput cells (0,0)=0, (0,6)=0, (4,0)=0, (4,6)=0 \u2192 max is0.\n\nExample0's output cell (0,1):\n\nInput cells (0,1)=8, (0,5)=8, (4,1)=8, (4,5)=8 \u2192 max8.\n\nExample0's output cell (0,2):\n\nInput cells (0,2)=0, (0,4)=0, (4,2)=0, (4,4)=0 \u2192 max0.\n\nSo output row0: [0,8,0], which matches.\n\nFor output cell (1,0):\n\nInput cells (1,0)=8, (1,6)=8, (3,0)=8, (3,6)=8 \u2192 max8.\n\nOutput cell (1,0) is8.\n\nOutput cell (1,1):\n\nInput cells (1,3)=0, (1,3)=0, (3,3)=0, (3,3)=0 \u2192 max0. But output cell (1,1) is8. So this doesn't fit.\n\nHmm, so this approach works for some cells but not others. Perhaps the middle cell is different.\n\nWait, maybe for the middle cell (1,1), we consider input's center cell (2,3). But in Example0, it's0. But output's middle is8. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe for the middle cell, we consider all four surrounding cells. Not sure.\n\nBut this approach works for the outer cells. For example, output cell (1,2) in Example0:\n\nInput cells (1,2)=0, (1,4)=0, (3,2)=0, (3,4)=0 \u2192 max0. But output cell (1,2) is8. So this doesn't fit.\n\nThis is confusing. Given the time constraints, I'll proceed with the hypothesis that each output cell is the maximum of the four mirrored positions as described earlier, even though it doesn't fit all cases. But the examples don't all fit, so maybe there's a different pattern.\n\nWait, looking at Example3's output:\n\nInput row0: [4,0,0,0,0,0,4]\n\nInput row4: [4,0,0,0,0,4,4]\n\nOutput row0: [4,0,4]\n\nOutput row2: [4,4,4]\n\nIf we take for output row0, the input row0's 0,3,6 \u21924,0,4. For output row2, input row4's 0,5,6 \u21924,4,4. That fits. Similarly, output row1 is input row2's 0,3,6 \u21920,0,0.\n\nSo the pattern could be:\n\nFor each output row i:\n\n- If i is 0: take input row0's columns0,3,6\n\n- If i is 1: take input row2's columns0,3,6\n\n- If i is 2: take input row4's columns0,5,6 (or columns0,5,6 if row4's 5 and6 are non-zero)\n\nLet's test this with Example0:\n\nOutput row0: input row0's0,3,6 \u21920,0,0. But output is [0,8,0]. So no.\n\nExample1's output row0: input row0's0,3,6 \u21922,0,2. But output is [2,2,2]. So this doesn't fit.\n\nExample3's output row0:4,0,4 \u2192 matches input row0's0,3,6. Output row2:4,4,4 \u2192 input row4's0,5,6 \u21924,4,4. Which matches.\n\nExample4's output row0:0,3,0. Input row0's0,3,6 \u21920,0,0. Output row0 is [0,3,0]. So that doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. This approach works for Example3 but not others. So maybe it's not consistent.\n\nAnother idea: The output's row0 is formed by taking the first element of row0, the middle element of row0, and the last element of row0. For row1: the same from row2. For row2: the same from row4. For Example0:\n\nRow0:0,0,0 \u2192 output row0 is [0,8,0]. Doesn't fit.\n\nThis is really challenging. Given the time I've invested and not finding a clear pattern, I'll have to make an educated guess based on the examples.\n\nLooking at the test input:\n\nTest Input:\n\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1]\n\n[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n[0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]\n\nFollowing the pattern observed in the examples, particularly Example0 and Example1, where the output seems to capture the non-zero elements in a symmetrical way. For the test input, the non-zero elements are:\n\nRow0: 1,1 (positions5,6)\n\nRow1:1 (position0)\n\nRow4:1 (position1 and6)\n\nAssuming the output is constructed by taking the maximum of the mirrored positions as before, let's compute each output cell.\n\nOutput cell (0,0):\n\n input cells (0,0), (0,6), (4,0), (4,6) \u21920,1,0,1 \u2192 max 1.\n\nOutput cell (0,1):\n\n input cells (0,1), (0,5), (4,1), (4,5) \u21920,0,1,0 \u2192 max1.\n\nOutput cell (0,2):\n\n input cells (0,2), (0,4), (4,2), (4,4) \u21920,0,0,0 \u21920.\n\nSo row0: [1,1,0]\n\nOutput cell (1,0):\n\n input cells (1,0), (1,6), (3,0), (3,6) \u21921,0,0,0 \u2192max1.\n\nOutput cell (1,1):\n\n input cells (1,3), (1,3), (3,3), (3,3) \u21920,0 \u21920.\n\nOutput cell (1,2):\n\n input cells (1,2), (1,4), (3,2), (3,4) \u21920,0,0,0 \u21920.\n\nRow1: [1,0,0]\n\nOutput cell (2,0):\n\n input cells (4,0), (4,6), (0,0), (0,6) \u21920,1,0,1 \u2192max1.\n\nOutput cell (2,1):\n\n input cells (4,1), (4,5), (0,1), (0,5) \u21921,0,0,0 \u2192max1.\n\nOutput cell (2,2):\n\n input cells (4,2), (4,4), (0,2), (0,4) \u21920,0,0,0 \u21920.\n\nRow2: [1,1,0]\n\nBut the output from the examples often has the non-zero elements arranged in a certain way. However, this approach gives an output of:\n\n[1,1,0]\n\n[1,0,0]\n\n[1,1,0]\n\nBut looking at the training examples, especially Example1 and Example4, the outputs are not symmetric. So perhaps this is not the right approach.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the test input, the non-zero elements are in:\n\nRow0: 5,6 \u21921,1\n\nRow1:0 \u21921\n\nRow4:1,6 \u21921,1\n\nThe output should perhaps capture these. Let's imagine that the output is formed by taking:\n\n- Row0: row0's5,6 and row1's0 \u2192 but output row0 would have three elements. Maybe row0's5 and6, and row4's6.\n\nBut how to arrange.\n\nAlternatively, the output row0 is formed by taking the first non-zero element from row0, then from row1, then from row4. But this is speculative.\n\nAnother approach: The output's rows are formed by taking elements from the input's rows in a certain order. For example:\n\nOutput row0: first non-zero from row0, first non-zero from row1, first non-zero from row4.\n\nBut in the test input:\n\nRow0's first non-zero is at5 (1), row1's first non-zero is0 (1), row4's first non-zero is1 (position1).\n\nSo output row0:1,1,1 \u2192 [1,1,1]\n\nBut example outputs don't necessarily aggregate like this.\n\nGiven the time I've spent, I'll have to make a educated guess based on the closest pattern I can find. \n\nLooking at the test input and considering the examples, particularly Example1 and Example4, I notice that the output often takes elements from the first row's end, the middle rows, and the last row. For example, in Example4, the output's last row has 3s from the last row's end.\n\nFor the test input, the output might be:\n\nRow0: [0,1,1] (from row0's elements5,6)\n\nRow1: [1,0,0] (from row1's element0)\n\nRow2: [0,1,1] (from row4's elements1 and6)\n\nBut this gives a 3x3 with:\n\n[0,1,1]\n\n[1,0,0]\n\n[0,1,1]\n\nBut looking at the training examples, the outputs often have a certain symmetry. For instance, Example0's output is symmetric across both axes. The test input's non-zero elements are not symmetric, but the output may reflect that.\n\nAlternatively, the output could be:\n\n[1,1,0]\n\n[1,0,0]\n\n[0,1,1]\n\nBut I'm not sure. Alternatively, considering the pattern from Example0, where the output's middle row is all the same number, perhaps the test input's output's middle row has 1s. But I'm not confident.\n\nGiven the time I've spent, I'll go with the following output for the test input:\n\n[0,1,1]\n\n[1,0,0]\n\n[0,1,1]\n\nBut I'm not sure. However, looking at Example3's output, which has [4,0,4] in row0 and [4,4,4] in row2, which are the first and last elements of the input's rows0 and4, perhaps the test output is:\n\n[1,1,0]\n\n[1,0,0]\n\n[0,1,1]\n\nBut this is a guess.",

        "cot_2": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. So, we have these input matrices and their corresponding outputs. The inputs are all 5 rows by 7 columns, and the outputs are 3 rows by 3 columns. The task is to figure out how the input is transformed into the output and then apply that to the test input.\n\nLooking at the first example, Example 0. The input is a 5x7 grid. The output is 3x3. Let's see:\n\nInput rows (each row is a list):\nRow 0: [0,8,0,0,0,8,0]\nRow 1: [8,8,0,0,0,8,8]\nRow 2: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\nRow 3: [8,8,0,0,0,8,8]\nRow 4: [0,8,0,0,0,8,0]\n\nOutput:\n[0,8,0]\n[8,8,8]\n[0,8,0]\n\nHmm. Let's compare positions. Maybe each output cell is derived from certain positions in the input. For example, the output's top-left corner (0,0) is 0. In the input's first row, first element is 0. The output's center (1,1) is 8, which is the center of the input row 1? Wait, the input rows are 7 elements, so the center would be index 3. But row 1 in input is [8,8,0,0,0,8,8], so the center is 0. But the output center is 8. Maybe it's combining elements from different rows and columns.\n\nWait, maybe the output is constructed by taking elements from specific positions in the input matrix. Let's look at another example to see.\n\nTake Example 1's input:\n\nInput rows:\n[2,2,0,0,0,2,2]\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,2]\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n[0,2,0,0,0,2,0]\n[2,0,0,0,0,0,2]\n\nOutput:\n[2,2,2]\n[0,2,2]\n[2,0,2]\n\nLooking at output's first row: 2,2,2. Maybe these correspond to the first elements of rows 0,1,2 in the input. Wait, row0 starts with 2, row1 starts with 0, but the output first row is 2,2,2. That doesn't fit. Alternatively, perhaps the output is a combination of the corners and middle elements from the input rows.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each row in the output is constructed from the first, middle, and last elements of each input row. For example, in Example 0's input row 0: [0,8,0,0,0,8,0]. First element 0, middle (index 3) is 0, last element 0. But the output's first row is [0,8,0]. Wait, the output's first row might be taking elements from the first input row's positions 0, 3, 6 (since the input row has 7 elements, indices 0-6). So 0, 3, 6 are first, middle, last. For input row 0: 0, 0, 0. But the output first row is [0,8,0]. Hmm, that doesn't match. So maybe not that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by the corners and center of the input matrix. Let's see Example 0's input. The input is 5 rows. The output is 3 rows. Maybe the output's rows correspond to the first, middle, and last rows of the input, and the columns are the first, middle, and last elements of those rows.\n\nFor Example 0:\n\nInput rows 0, 2, 4. Let's take those. Then for each of these rows, take elements 0, 3, 6 (since each row has 7 elements, indices 0-6).\n\nRow 0: elements 0,3,6: 0,0,0 \u2192 but output row 0 is [0,8,0]. That's not matching. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe the output is constructed from the input by taking certain positions in each quadrant. For example, maybe the input is divided into a 3x3 grid, but that's 5 rows and 7 columns. Alternatively, the output is created by combining the non-zero elements from specific overlapping regions.\n\nLooking at Example 0's output: [0,8,0], [8,8,8], [0,8,0]. The input's first row has 8s at positions 1 and 5. The second row has 8s at 0,1,5,6. The fourth row is same as the second. The fifth row is same as first. The third row is all zeros.\n\nSo in the output, the center is 8, which might come from the input's middle row (row 2 is all zeros, so perhaps not). Alternatively, maybe each output cell is the maximum value from certain positions in the input. For example, output center (1,1) could be the maximum of input's center (row 2, column 3) and surrounding cells. But in example 0, the input's center is 0, but output center is 8. So maybe that's not it.\n\nAlternatively, think of the output as a 3x3 grid where each cell is the sum or some operation of the corresponding regions in the input. Let's think of the input as a larger grid, and the output is a condensed version.\n\nAnother approach: perhaps the output is formed by taking the first, middle, and last rows of the input, and within those rows, taking the first, middle, and last elements. But let's check.\n\nFor Example 0:\n\nInput rows are 0,1,2,3,4. Middle row is row 2. So output rows would be rows 0,2,4. For each of these rows, take elements 0,3,6.\n\nRow 0: elements 0,3,6 \u2192 0,0,0 \u2192 output row 0 is [0,8,0]. Doesn't match.\n\nHmm. Alternatively, maybe the output rows are formed by taking the middle elements of the input rows. For example, in Example 0's input, the first row (0) has elements 0,8,0,0,0,8,0. The middle three elements would be 0,0,0? No, that's not matching.\n\nWait, perhaps the output is constructed by taking the non-zero elements from specific positions. Let's look at Example 0's output. The output has 8s in a cross pattern. The input has 8s forming a sort of diamond shape. So maybe the output is the central part of the input's pattern. But how?\n\nAnother idea: the output's dimensions are 3x3, and the input is 5x7. Maybe each cell in the output is the value at position (i*2, j*2) in the input. Because 5 rows: indices 0,2,4 (since 0,1,2,3,4: middle is 2). 7 columns: indices 0, 3, 6. So for a 3x3 output, i and j go from 0 to 2. So for output cell (i,j), input cell is (i*2, j*3). Let's check.\n\nFor Example 0:\n\nOutput cell (0,0) would be input row 0, column 0 \u2192 0. Which matches output [0,8,0] first element.\n\nOutput cell (0,1) would be input row 0, column 3 \u2192 0. But in the output, it's 8. Hmm, doesn't match. So that's not right.\n\nWait, maybe it's (i*2, j*2) but in the columns. For columns, 7 elements. So to get 3 columns, maybe columns 0, 3, 6. So j*3. So for i in 0, 2, 4 (rows) and j in 0,3,6 (columns). Let's check.\n\nExample 0 output row 0: input rows 0,0,0. But the output is [0,8,0]. Hmm, input row 0, columns 0,3,6 are 0,0,0. So that doesn't fit. But the output's first row is [0,8,0]. So maybe this approach is incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is a 3x3 grid that's the central part of the input, but how? The input is 5 rows (maybe the middle three rows) and 7 columns (middle three columns). For example, rows 1,2,3 and columns 2,3,4. Let's check Example 0:\n\nInput rows 1: [8,8,0,0,0,8,8]\n\nTaking columns 2,3,4 \u2192 0,0,0. Output row 1 is [8,8,8]. So that's not matching. Hmm.\n\nAlternative approach: Let's look for how each output cell is formed. Maybe each output cell is the sum (or some other function) of the input cells in a certain pattern around the corresponding position.\n\nFor Example 0's output center (1,1) is 8. The input's center is row 2, column 3 (0). So perhaps not the sum. Maybe the maximum value in a certain neighborhood.\n\nLooking at input around row 2, column 3: The cells around it in the input would be from rows 1 and 3, columns 2-4. But that's zeros. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking the corners of the input. The input's four corners and center. But the output is 3x3. Let me think.\n\nWait, in Example 0's input, the first row has 0,8,0,0,0,8,0. So the first and sixth elements are 8 (positions 1 and 5). The second row starts and ends with 8, and positions 1 and 5 are 8. The third row is all zeros. The fourth row is like the second. The fifth row like the first. The output is a cross: 8 in the middle and vertical and horizontal. So maybe the output is the middle 3x3 of the input, but how? Because the input is 5x7.\n\nAlternatively, the output is created by combining the first, third, and fifth rows (0,2,4) and within those rows, taking the second, fourth, and sixth elements (1,3,5). Let's check:\n\nExample 0:\n\nRow 0: elements 1,3,5 \u2192 8,0,8 \u2192 but output row 0 is [0,8,0]. Hmm, not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking elements from the first, third, and fifth columns. But the input has 7 columns, so columns 0,3,6?\n\nFor Example 0's input row 0: [0,8,0,0,0,8,0]. Taking columns 0,3,6: 0,0,0. But output row 0 is [0,8,0]. So that's not matching.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is a 3x3 grid where each cell (i,j) is the sum of the input's cells (i*2, j*2), (i*2, j*2 +1), (i*2 +1, j*2), (i*2 +1, j*2 +1), etc. But given the input is 5x7, perhaps a sliding window. But the input is 5 rows (odd) and 7 columns (odd), so if divided into 3x3 regions, how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking the maximum value from each quadrant of the input. For example, each output cell corresponds to a section of the input. Let's see:\n\nDivide the input into 3 rows (top, middle, bottom) and 3 columns (left, center, right). Each output cell is the maximum (or other function) of the corresponding section.\n\nFor Example 0's input:\n\nTop rows (rows 0 and 1), middle row (row 2), bottom rows (rows 3 and 4). Columns left (0-1), center (2-4), right (5-6).\n\nThen output cell (0,0) would be max of top-left section (rows 0-1, columns 0-1). Let's check:\n\nRows 0-1, columns 0-1: elements are 0,8 (row0) and 8,8 (row1). Max is 8. But output (0,0) is 0. So that's not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is taking the center values from the input's rows. For example, for each row in the input, take the middle element (index 3) and then arrange them in some way. But Example 0's input rows 0-4 have middle elements 0,0,0,0,0. So output would be all zeros, which is not the case. So no.\n\nAnother approach: let's look at the positions of non-zero elements in the input and see how they map to the output.\n\nIn Example 0, the input has 8s forming a diamond-like shape. The output is a cross of 8s. So maybe the output is the central part of the input's pattern. But how?\n\nAlternatively, the output is created by taking certain elements from the input's non-zero positions. For instance, in Example 0, the output's middle row is [8,8,8], which could correspond to the 8s in the second row of the input's first and fifth columns. Wait, the input's second row (index1) has 8s at positions 0,1,5,6. The output's middle row is all 8s. So perhaps the middle row of the output is taking elements from the input's middle row (row2), but row2 is all zeros. That doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. Maybe the output is formed by looking for symmetry. For example, in Example0, the input is symmetric both vertically and horizontally. The output is a cross, which is symmetric. But how to derive it?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is constructed by merging the first and last rows and columns. For example, the output's first row is the first element of the first row, the middle element of the first row, and the last element of the first row. Then similarly for the middle row (taking elements from the middle of each row), and the last row. But that doesn't fit Example0.\n\nWait, let's take Example0's output again:\n\nOutput row0: [0,8,0]. Input row0's elements 0,1,6: 0,8,0. Oh! That's possible. So for output row0, take elements 0,1,6 from input row0.\n\nSimilarly, output row1: [8,8,8]. Take elements 0,1,6 from input row1: 8,8,8. Yes, that fits.\n\nOutput row2: [0,8,0]. Take elements 0,1,6 from input row4: 0,8,0. That matches.\n\nSo the pattern would be: for each of the output rows 0,1,2, take the first, second, and last elements of the input's rows 0,1,4 (or maybe 0,1,4). Wait in Example0's output, there are three rows, and the input has 5 rows. So the output rows correspond to input rows 0,1,4? Because the first three output rows are 0,1, and 4? Because in Example0, the output has 3 rows: first from row0, second from row1, third from row4. Let's check other examples.\n\nTake Example1:\n\nInput rows:\n0: [2,2,0,0,0,2,2]\n1: [0,0,0,0,0,0,2]\n2: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n3: [0,2,0,0,0,2,0]\n4: [2,0,0,0,0,0,2]\n\nOutput:\nRow0: [2,2,2] \u2192 elements 0,1,6 of input row0: 2,2,2 \u2192 yes.\nRow1: [0,2,2] \u2192 elements 0,1,6 of input row1: 0,0,2 \u2192 but output is [0,2,2]. Doesn't match. So maybe that's not correct.\n\nWait, but in Example1's output row1 is [0,2,2]. Input row1's elements 0,1,6 are 0,0,2. So that gives [0,0,2], which doesn't match. So maybe this idea is wrong.\n\nWait, but let's check the output row1. How does [0,2,2] come from the input? Maybe it's taking elements from input row3. Input row3: elements 0,1,6 are 0,2,0. But output row1 is [0,2,2]. Doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output rows are a combination of input rows 0,2,4. Let's check Example1:\n\nInput row0: elements 0,1,6 \u2192 2,2,2 \u2192 matches output row0.\nInput row2 (all zeros) \u2192 elements 0,1,6 \u2192 0,0,0 \u2192 but output row1 is [0,2,2]. Doesn't fit.\nInput row4: elements 0,1,6 \u2192 2,0,2 \u2192 matches output row2 [2,0,2].\n\nBut output row1 is [0,2,2]. So where does that come from? Maybe input row3. Row3's elements 0,1,6: 0,2,0. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output rows are input rows 0,3,4. Let's check:\n\nInput row0's 0,1,6: 2,2,2 \u2192 row0 of output.\nInput row3's 0,1,6: 0,2,0 \u2192 which would be [0,2,0], but output row1 is [0,2,2]. So no.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output's middle row is the sum of certain input rows. For Example1, output row1 is [0,2,2]. Maybe input rows 1 and 3? Row1's 0,1,6: 0,0,2. Row3's 0,1,6: 0,2,0. Adding these gives 0+0=0, 0+2=2, 2+0=2 \u2192 which matches the output row1. Oh! That's interesting. So the output rows might be:\n\nRow0: input row0's 0,1,6.\n\nRow1: sum (or some combination) of input rows1 and 3's 0,1,6.\n\nRow2: input row4's 0,1,6.\n\nLet's test this for Example0:\n\nOutput row1: [8,8,8]. Input rows1 and 3 are the same: [8,8,0,0,0,8,8]. Their 0,1,6 elements are 8,8,8 each. Summing would give 16,16,16, but output is 8,8,8. Oh, maybe it's taking the maximum instead. So for each position in the output row1, take the maximum of input row1 and row3's elements. For Example0, row1 and row3 are same, so elements are 8. So output row1 is 8,8,8. That fits.\n\nFor Example1:\n\nOutput row1 is [0,2,2]. Input row1's 0,1,6: 0,0,2. Input row3's 0,1,6: 0,2,0. Taking the max of each position:\n\n0 vs 0 \u2192 0\n\n0 vs 2 \u2192 2\n\n2 vs 0 \u2192 2 \u2192 which gives [0,2,2]. That matches the output row1.\n\nSimilarly, in Example1's output row0 is input row0's 0,1,6 \u2192 2,2,2. Output row2 is input row4's 0,1,6 \u2192 2,0,2. Which matches.\n\nAnother example: Example2:\n\nInput rows:\n0: [4,4,0,0,0,4,0]\n1: [0,0,0,0,0,4,4]\n2: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n3: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n4: [4,0,0,0,0,0,4]\n\nOutput:\n[4,4,0]\n[0,4,4]\n[4,0,4]\n\nLet's apply the pattern.\n\nRow0: input row0's 0,1,6 \u2192 4,4,0 \u2192 matches output row0.\n\nRow1: max of input row1 and row3's 0,1,6. Row1's 0,1,6: 0,0,4. Row3's 0,1,6: 0,0,0. Max is [0,0,4]. But output row1 is [0,4,4]. Hmm, doesn't fit. Wait, the output row1 is [0,4,4], but according to this, it would be [0,0,4]. So maybe this pattern is incorrect.\n\nWait, what's the output row1 of Example2? [0,4,4]. Let's see input rows1 and 3. Row1 has 0,0,0,0,0,4,4 \u2192 elements 0,1,6 \u2192 0,0,4. Row3 is all zeros \u2192 elements 0,1,6 \u2192 0,0,0. Max of each is 0,0,4. But output is [0,4,4]. So this doesn't fit. So maybe the pattern is different.\n\nAlternative idea: Maybe the output's middle row is input row2's 0,1,6. But in Example2, row2 is all zeros, but output row1 is [0,4,4]. So that's not possible.\n\nHmm. Let's look at Example3:\n\nInput rows:\n0: [4,0,0,0,0,0,4]\n1: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n2: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n3: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n4: [4,0,0,0,0,4,4]\n\nOutput:\n[4,0,4]\n[0,0,0]\n[4,4,4]\n\nRow0: input row0's 0,1,6 \u2192 4,0,4 \u2192 matches output row0.\n\nRow1: max of row1 and row3's 0,1,6. Both rows are all zeros, so output [0,0,0], which matches.\n\nRow2: input row4's 0,1,6 \u2192 4,0,4. But output row2 is [4,4,4]. So this doesn't fit. So previous pattern is invalid.\n\nWait, for Example3's output row2 is [4,4,4]. Input row4's 0,1,6: 4,0,4. So that would not match. So maybe the pattern is not taking row4's 0,1,6. Alternatively, maybe row4's 0,5,6? Because input row4 is [4,0,0,0,0,4,4]. Elements 0,5,6 are 4,4,4. Which matches the output row2. So perhaps the output row2 is taking elements 0,5,6 from input row4.\n\nSimilarly, output row0 takes elements 0,5,6 from input row0. Let's check:\n\nExample0's input row0: [0,8,0,0,0,8,0]. Elements 0,5,6: 0,8,0 \u2192 which matches output row0.\n\nExample1's input row0: [2,2,0,0,0,2,2]. Elements 0,5,6: 2,2,2 \u2192 matches output row0 [2,2,2].\n\nExample2's input row0: [4,4,0,0,0,4,0]. Elements 0,5,6:4,4,0 \u2192 matches output row0 [4,4,0].\n\nExample3's input row0: [4,0,0,0,0,0,4]. Elements 0,5,6:4,0,4 \u2192 matches output row0 [4,0,4].\n\nExample4's input row0: [0,3,0,0,0,3,0]. Elements 0,5,6:0,3,0 \u2192 matches output row0 [0,3,0].\n\nSo the pattern for row0 of the output is elements 0,5,6 of input row0.\n\nFor row2 of the output, elements 0,5,6 of input row4. Let's check:\n\nExample0's row4: [0,8,0,0,0,8,0]. Elements 0,5,6:0,8,0 \u2192 output row2 [0,8,0]. Correct.\n\nExample1's row4: [2,0,0,0,0,0,2]. Elements 0,5,6:2,0,2 \u2192 output row2 [2,0,2]. Correct.\n\nExample2's row4: [4,0,0,0,0,0,4]. Elements 0,5,6:4,0,4 \u2192 output row2 [4,0,4]. Correct.\n\nExample3's row4: [4,0,0,0,0,4,4]. Elements 0,5,6:4,4,4 \u2192 output row2 [4,4,4]. Correct.\n\nExample4's row4: [0,0,0,0,0,0,3]. Elements 0,5,6:0,0,3 \u2192 output row2 [0,0,3]. Correct.\n\nNow, for the middle row of the output (row1), where does it come from? Let's check the examples.\n\nExample0's output row1: [8,8,8]. Input rows1 and 3 are [8,8,0,0,0,8,8]. Let's take elements 0,5,6 of row1: 8,8,8 \u2192 which matches.\n\nExample1's output row1: [0,2,2]. Input rows1 and 3:\n\nRow1: [0,0,0,0,0,0,2]. Elements 0,5,6: 0,0,2.\n\nRow3: [0,2,0,0,0,2,0]. Elements 0,5,6:0,2,0.\n\nSo for the output row1, maybe combining these two rows. How? Perhaps taking the maximum of each corresponding element.\n\nFor elements 0: max(0,0) \u21920.\n\nElement5: max(0,2) \u21922.\n\nElement6: max(2,0) \u21922.\n\nWhich gives [0,2,2], matching Example1's output row1.\n\nExample2's output row1: [0,4,4]. Input rows1 and 3:\n\nRow1: [0,0,0,0,0,4,4]. Elements 0,5,6:0,4,4.\n\nRow3: all zeros. Elements 0,5,6:0,0,0.\n\nMax of each element: 0,4,4 \u2192 which matches the output row1.\n\nExample3's output row1: [0,0,0]. Input rows1 and 3 are all zeros. So max is zeros. Correct.\n\nExample4's output row1: [3,0,3]. Let's check:\n\nInput rows1 and 3 (but Example4's input rows are:\n\nRow1: [3,0,0,0,0,0,3]. Wait, no, Example4's input:\n\nInput rows:\n0: [0,3,0,0,0,3,0]\n1: [3,0,0,0,0,0,3]\n2: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n3: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n4: [0,0,0,0,0,0,3]\n\nOutput row1: [3,0,3].\n\nAh, so input row1 is [3,0,0,0,0,0,3]. Elements 0,5,6:3,0,3.\n\nInput row3 is all zeros. So max of row1 and row3's elements 0,5,6: 3,0,3. Which matches output row1 [3,0,3]. Wait, but the output row1 is [3,0,3]. So this fits.\n\nSo the pattern seems to be:\n\n- The output is a 3x3 matrix.\n\n- For each row in the output:\n\n   - Row 0: elements 0,5,6 of input row0.\n\n   - Row 1: elements 0,5,6 of input row1 and row3, taking the maximum for each corresponding position.\n\n   - Row 2: elements 0,5,6 of input row4.\n\nWait, but for row1 of the output, it's combining elements from input row1 and row3. Because in Example0, both row1 and row3 are present and same. In Example2, row3 is all zeros, so the output row1 comes from row1's elements. But in Example4, row1 has elements [3,0,0,0,0,0,3], so elements 0,5,6 are 3,0,3. Row3 is all zeros, so the max is 3,0,3. Which matches output row1 [3,0,3].\n\nSo the process is:\n\nFor each of the output rows:\n\n- Output row0: input row0, elements 0,5,6.\n\n- Output row1: maximum of input row1 and row3, elements 0,5,6.\n\n- Output row2: input row4, elements 0,5,6.\n\nWait, but in Example3, input rows1 and3 are both all zeros, so the output row1 is [0,0,0], which matches.\n\nYes, this seems to fit all the examples.\n\nNow, applying this pattern to the test input.\n\nTest input:\n\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1] \u2192 row0\n[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0] \u2192 row1\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0] \u2192 row2\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0] \u2192 row3\n[0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1] \u2192 row4\n\nOutput rows:\n\nRow0: input row0's elements 0,5,6 \u2192 0,1,1 \u2192 [0,1,1].\n\nRow1: max of row1 and row3's elements 0,5,6. Row1's elements 0,5,6:1,0,0. Row3's elements 0,5,6:0,0,0. Taking max of each position: 1 vs0 \u21921; 0 vs0 \u21920; 0 vs0 \u21920. So [1,0,0].\n\nRow2: input row4's elements 0,5,6 \u21920,0,1 \u2192 [0,0,1].\n\nSo the output would be:\n\n[0, 1, 1]\n[1, 0, 0]\n[0, 0, 1]\n\nBut looking at the training examples, their outputs are all 3x3 matrices. Let me check if this makes sense.\n\nWait, the test input's row1 is [1,0,0,0,0,0,0]. Elements 0,5,6 are 1 (element0), 0 (element5), 0 (element6). So row1's elements 0,5,6 are 1,0,0.\n\nRow3 is all zeros, so elements 0,5,6 are 0,0,0. Max between 1,0,0 and 0,0,0 is 1,0,0. So output row1 is [1,0,0].\n\nRow4's elements 0,5,6 are 0 (element0), 0 (element5), 1 (element6). So output row2 is [0,0,1].\n\nSo the final output would be:\n\n[0,1,1]\n[1,0,0]\n[0,0,1]\n\nBut let's compare with the training examples. For example, Example2's output was:\n\n[4,4,0]\n[0,4,4]\n[4,0,4]\n\nWhich fits the pattern of elements 0,5,6 from respective rows.\n\nSo the test input's output should be as above."
