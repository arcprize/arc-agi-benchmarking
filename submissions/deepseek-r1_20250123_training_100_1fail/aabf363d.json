        "cot_1": "Okay, let's tackle this puzzle. So, the task is to figure out the pattern from the training examples and apply it to the test input. Let me start by looking closely at the training examples to understand what's going on.\n\nLooking at Example 0's input and output:\n\nIn the input, there's a grid where the numbers are mostly 0s and 2s. The output takes those 2s and turns them into 4s, but the 4 at the bottom of the input (last row, first element) becomes 0 in the output. Also, all other numbers except the bottom 4 in the input are 0s. So maybe the transformation is doubling the non-zero numbers and then moving the bottom number (which is 4 in the input) to 0, but wait, in the input example 0, the last row starts with 4. In the output, that 4 becomes 0. But the other 2s are doubled to 4. So maybe the rule is: double each non-zero number except the one in the last row's first position, which is set to 0.\n\nLooking at Example 1's input and output:\n\nIn the input, the numbers are 3s and a 6 at the bottom. The output converts all 3s to 6s (doubled) and the 6 at the bottom becomes 0. So same pattern here. The non-zero numbers (3s) are doubled, and the bottom-left number (6) is set to 0.\n\nSo the pattern seems to be:\n\n1. For each cell in the grid, if the number is non-zero and not the first element of the last row, double its value.\n2. The first element of the last row (the number in the bottom-left corner) is set to 0 in the output.\n\nTesting this against the training examples:\n\nIn Example 0 input, the last row starts with 4. In the output, that becomes 0. All other 2s become 4s. Correct.\n\nIn Example 1 input, the last row starts with 6. Output becomes 0. All 3s become 6s. Correct.\n\nSo applying this to the test input:\n\nTest input has an 8s structure and a 2 in the bottom-left corner. Let's check each element.\n\nThe last row's first element is 2 (from the test input). According to the pattern, this should become 0. All other non-zero numbers (8s) should be doubled to 16? Wait, but in the examples, the outputs use the same number as the doubled value. Wait, example 0's input has 2s turning into 4s (2*2), and example 1's 3s into 6s (3*2). The test input has 8s, so they should become 16? But looking at the examples, the output numbers are exactly twice the input numbers. So 8 would become 16. But the test output's example uses 8s. Wait, but wait the test input's last row starts with 2, which would be set to 0. All other 8s would become 16. But let's look again at the training examples' output. Wait, in example 0, the input 2 becomes 4 (2*2), and the 4 in the bottom becomes 0. In example 1, 3 becomes 6, and 6 in the bottom becomes 0. So yes, the transformation is double the non-zero numbers except the bottom-left element, which is set to 0. Therefore, in the test input, all 8s should become 16, and the bottom-left 2 becomes 0.\n\nBut wait, the output format in the training examples doesn't have numbers larger than 6. Wait in example 1, input 3 becomes 6. So doubling is allowed. So 8 would become 16, but that's possible. But let me check if there's another pattern. Maybe the number at the bottom is being used as the doubling factor? Wait, in example 0, the bottom number is 4, and all 2s are doubled to 4. In example 1, the bottom number is 6, and all 3s are doubled to 6. Oh, wait! That's a different possible pattern. Instead of doubling, maybe replace all instances of (n) with 2n where n is the value in the bottom-left cell divided by 2. Because in example 0, the bottom cell is 4, so 4/2=2. So all 2s become 4. Similarly, example 1's bottom is 6, which is 6/2=3, so all 3s become 6. Then, the bottom cell is set to 0. So the pattern is: take the value of the bottom-left cell, divide by 2, and replace all instances of that value in the grid with the bottom-left cell's value. Then set the bottom-left cell to 0. \n\nLet me check that. Example 0 input's bottom-left is 4. So 4/2=2. All 2s in the input are replaced by 4. Then the bottom-left becomes 0. That matches the output. Example 1's bottom-left is 6. 6/2=3. All 3s are replaced by 6. Then bottom-left is 0. That fits. \n\nAh, this is a better pattern. Because in the first example, the 2s are replaced by 4, which is exactly the value of the bottom-left cell. Similarly, in the second example, the 3s are replaced by 6, the bottom-left cell. So the rule is: find the value at the bottom-left cell (let's call it X). Then, in the entire grid (except the bottom-left cell), replace every occurrence of (X/2) with X, then set the bottom-left cell to 0.\n\nSo for the test input:\n\nThe bottom-left cell is 2. So X=2. Then X/2=1. So all cells with value 1 in the input should be replaced with 2, then set the bottom-left to 0. But wait, the test input's grid has 8s and 2 in the bottom. But according to this pattern, since X is 2, we should replace all 1s (since 2/2=1) with 2. But the test input doesn't have any 1s. Wait, that can't be. The test input's non-zero numbers are 8s and a 2. So according to the previous pattern, this approach would not work. Unless I'm misunderstanding.\n\nWait, perhaps the pattern is different. Let's re-express:\n\nIn training example 0, the bottom-left is 4. All 2s (which is 4/2) are replaced by 4, and then the bottom-left becomes 0. In example 1, the bottom-left is 6. All 3s (6/2) are replaced by 6, then the bottom-left becomes 0. So in the test input, the bottom-left is 2. So 2/2=1. So all 1s in the input should be replaced by 2, and the bottom-left becomes 0. But the test input has 8s and a 2. There are no 1s. So that would result in no changes except setting the bottom-left to 0. But the test input's output would then have 8s replaced? Wait, that can't be. So this suggests that my initial assumption is wrong.\n\nHmm, perhaps I need to think again. Let's look at the test input. The test input has 8s in various places and a 2 at the bottom-left. If the pattern is to replace all instances of (X/2) with X, where X is the bottom-left value, then here X=2. So X/2=1. So replace all 1s with 2. But there are no 1s. So the output would be the same as the input, except the bottom-left becomes 0. But the 8s would remain 8s. But that's not possible because in the training examples, the replacement was based on X being the bottom-left value, and replacing X/2 with X. But in the test case, if X is 2, then X/2=1. So only 1s are replaced. Since there are none, the output would have the 8s untouched, and the bottom-left becomes 0. But that doesn't seem to fit any pattern. \n\nBut in the training examples, the non-zero numbers (other than the bottom-left) are exactly X/2. So in example 0, X=4, the others are 2. In example 1, X=6, others are 3. So perhaps in the test input, the presence of 8s and X=2 is conflicting with this pattern. So maybe this approach is wrong.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is to replace all numbers except the bottom-left with their doubled value, then set the bottom-left to zero. But in example 0, the 2s become 4, which is doubling, and the bottom-left (4) becomes 0. So that matches. Example 1: 3 becomes 6, which is doubling. The bottom-left 6 becomes 0. So yes. Then the test input: 8s would become 16, and the bottom-left 2 becomes 0. But in the outputs of the examples, they use the doubled numbers. So why in the test input would they use 16s? But the problem's output examples don't have any numbers beyond 6, but that's just the examples. The test could have 16.\n\nBut looking at the problem statement, the outputs are in the same format as the examples. So the test input's output should have the 8s replaced by 16s? But wait, looking at the training examples, the outputs' non-zero numbers are exactly twice the input's non-zero numbers (except the bottom-left). So perhaps that's the rule. So in the test input, all 8s should be doubled to 16, and the bottom-left 2 becomes 0. But that's possible.\n\nBut let me check again.\n\nWait, example 0:\n\nInput numbers are 2 and 4. Output numbers are 4 and 0. So 2 \u21924 (double), 4\u21920. \n\nExample 1:\n\nInput numbers are 3 and 6. Output numbers are 6 and 0. 3\u21926 (double), 6\u21920.\n\nSo the pattern is: For all cells except the bottom-left cell, if the value is non-zero, double it. Then set the bottom-left cell to 0.\n\nBut in example 0, the input's bottom-left is 4. The output sets it to 0. All other non-zero cells (2) are doubled to 4.\n\nIn example 1, input's bottom-left is 6. Output sets to 0. All other non-zero cells (3) are doubled to 6.\n\nSo the pattern is: double all non-zero values except the bottom-left, which becomes 0.\n\nSo applying this to the test input: all 8s (non-zero, not the bottom-left) become 16. The bottom-left 2 becomes 0.\n\nBut the test input's output would have 16s. But in the examples, the outputs have numbers that are exactly twice the input's non-zero numbers. So the answer would be:\n\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\n[0,16,16,16,0,0,0]\n\n[0,16,16,16,16,16,0]\n\n[0,0,0,16,16,0,0]\n\n[0,0,16,16,0,0,0]\n\n[0,0,16,16,16,0,0]\n\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nBut wait, the problem's examples' outputs don't have numbers higher than 6. But maybe that's just because the test input's case is different. However, let's check again the problem's instructions. It says to respond in the format of the training output examples. So the outputs in the examples had the same structure as the inputs, just with the numbers doubled and the bottom-left set to zero. So yes, even if the numbers are larger, like 8\u219216, that's correct.\n\nBut wait, looking back at the test input, maybe the pattern is different. Because in the test input, the bottom-left is 2, which is even. The other numbers are 8. So if we follow the same pattern as examples, the 8s would become 16, and the bottom-left 2 becomes 0. But maybe there's another pattern where the bottom-left number is the maximum value, and all other numbers are half of that. Let me think.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that the bottom-left number is the sum of all the other non-zero numbers divided by some factor. But that seems more complex. Let's see.\n\nIn example 0, the non-zero numbers (excluding the bottom-left 4) are 2s. There are 2+2+2+2+2+2+2+2+2? Wait, counting the input:\n\nLooking at Example 0's input:\n\nRow 0: all zeros.\n\nRow1: 0,2,2,2,0,0,0 \u2192 three 2s.\n\nRow2: 0,0,2,0 \u2192 one 2.\n\nRow3: 0,2,2,2,2 \u2192 four 2s.\n\nRow4: 0,0,2,2,2 \u2192 three 2s.\n\nRow5: 0,0,0,2 \u2192 one 2.\n\nRow6: 4,0,0,0,0,0,0 \u2192 one 4.\n\nTotal 2s: 3+1+4+3+1=12. The bottom-left is 4. 12 * 2 = 24. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the bottom-left is the number of non-zero cells (excluding itself) multiplied by the value of those cells. But that might not fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the bottom-left cell is the sum of all other non-zero cells. In example 0, sum of 2s is 12. But bottom-left is 4. 12 /3 =4. So maybe sum of non-zero cells (excluding bottom-left) is 12. 12 /3=4. Wait, 12 /3=4? Not sure. Maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, the bottom-left cell is twice the maximum of the other cells. In example 0, max is 2, so 2*2=4. In example 1, max is 3 (other than bottom-left 6), 3*2=6. So in test case, other cells are 8. So bottom-left should be 16. But in the test input, the bottom-left is 2. So that doesn't fit. So this pattern doesn't hold.\n\nHmm. So going back to the initial idea: the pattern is to double all non-zero cells except the bottom-left, which is set to 0.\n\nIn the test input, the 8s are non-zero, so they become 16. The bottom-left 2 becomes 0. So the output would have 16s where there were 8s, and the last row's first element is 0.\n\nBut let's check the structure of the output. In the training examples, the structure (shape) of the non-zero cells is the same as the input. For example, in example 0, the input's 2s form a certain pattern, and the output's 4s are in the same positions. Similarly in example 1, the 3s become 6s in the same positions. So the pattern's transformation doesn't change positions, only the values.\n\nTherefore, applying the same logic to the test input: all 8s are doubled to 16s, and the bottom-left 2 becomes 0. So the output would be:\n\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\n[0,16,16,16,0,0,0]\n\n[0,16,16,16,16,16,0]\n\n[0,0,0,16,16,0,0]\n\n[0,0,16,16,0,0,0]\n\n[0,0,16,16,16,0,0]\n\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nBut wait, looking at the problem's training examples, the outputs use numbers that are exactly the bottom-left value of the input. For example, in example 0, the input's bottom-left is 4, and all 2s (which are 4/2) are replaced by 4. Similarly in example 1, input's bottom-left is 6, and all 3s (6/2) are replaced by 6. So the rule is that every occurrence of (X/2), where X is the bottom-left cell's value, is replaced by X. Then, X's position is set to 0.\n\nBut in the test input, X is 2, so X/2 is 1. So all 1s in the input should be replaced by 2, and the bottom-left becomes 0. However, the test input doesn't have any 1s. It has 8s. So this would mean that all 1s would turn into 2s, but there are none. So the output would be the same as the input, except the bottom-left is 0. But that's not the case. So this approach is incorrect.\n\nHmm. So this suggests that the initial approach of doubling all non-zero cells except the bottom-left is the correct pattern. Because the examples don't require that the non-zero cells be half of the bottom-left. They just need to be doubled. For example, in example 0, the 2s are doubled to 4, and the bottom-left 4 is set to 0. The 4 in the input is not part of the other cells. So perhaps the pattern is indeed to double all non-zero values except the bottom-left, which is set to 0.\n\nIn that case, the test input's 8s would become 16s. However, looking at the problem's training examples, the outputs use numbers that are twice the input's non-zero numbers. So why would the test case's output have 16s? The answer would follow that pattern.\n\nBut perhaps there's a different approach. Let's look for other possible patterns.\n\nAnother possibility: the bottom-left number is the sum of all the other numbers in the input. Let's check.\n\nIn example 0's input:\n\nSum of all non-bottom-left numbers: 2+2+2 (row1) +2 (row2) +2+2+2+2 (row3) +2+2+2 (row4) +2 (row5) = 3+1+4+3+1=12. The bottom-left is 4. 12 is three times 4. Not sure.\n\nExample1's input: sum of non-bottom-left numbers: 3 (row2) +3+3+3 (row3) +3+3 (row4) +3+3 (row5) = 3 + 3*3 (row3) + 2*3 (row4) + 2*3 (row5) \u2192 3 +9 +6 +6 =24. Bottom-left is6. 24/6=4. Not a clear pattern.\n\nSo that approach seems incorrect.\n\nAlternative idea: the bottom-left cell is the maximum value in the input. In example0, 4 is the maximum. In example1, 6 is the maximum. So the pattern is: replace all instances of (max/2) with max, then set max to 0. In example0, max is4. All 2s (4/2) become4. In example1, max is6. All 3s (6/2=3) become6. So for the test input, the max is8 (the 8s in the grid), and the bottom-left is2. So this pattern would require the bottom-left to be the maximum, which it's not. So this approach is invalid for the test case.\n\nThus, the only viable pattern is that every non-zero cell except the bottom-left is doubled, and the bottom-left is set to zero. Therefore, in the test input, all 8s become 16s, and the bottom-left 2 becomes 0.\n\nTherefore, the output should be as follows.",

        "cot_2": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. So, looking at the training examples, both have an input grid and an output grid. The first thing I notice is that in the output, the numbers are doubled compared to the input. For example, in Example 0, the input has 2s and the output has 4s. Similarly, Example 1 has 3s turning into 6s and a 6 becoming 0 in the output. Wait, wait. Wait, the last row in Example 1's input is [6, 0, 0, ...] and in the output it's all zeros. Hmm, that's interesting.\n\nLooking at the structure, in both examples, the output seems to have all the non-zero numbers in the input doubled. But there's something else going on with the bottom row. In both training examples, the original input had a number in the bottom left corner (4 in Example 0 and 6 in Example 1), and in the output, that number is gone, replaced by zeros. So maybe the bottom row's first element is being removed, and the rest of the non-zero numbers are doubled.\n\nAnother thing to check: in Example 0's input, the bottom row is [4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], and the output's bottom row is all zeros. Similarly, in Example 1, the input's bottom row starts with 6, and the output's bottom row is all zeros. So perhaps the rule is that the first element of the last row (the bottom-left corner) is set to zero, and all other non-zero elements are doubled.\n\nWait, but in the outputs, other elements are doubled. Let's check:\n\nIn Example 0's input, the 2s become 4s, except for the last row's 4 which becomes 0. Similarly, in Example 1, the 3s become 6s, and the 6 in the last row becomes 0. So the pattern seems to be: for each cell, if it's in the last row (the 7th row, index 6 if starting from 0), then set it to 0. Otherwise, if it's non-zero, double its value. Wait, but in Example 1's input, the last row is [6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], and in the output, the entire last row is zero. So perhaps the entire last row is set to zero, regardless of the original values. Let me check the input and output for Example 0:\n\nInput's last row is [4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], output is all zeros. Similarly in Example 1. So the pattern could be:\n\n- For all rows except the last one, double the non-zero values.\n- For the last row, set all elements to zero.\n\nWait, but what about the last row in the input? For example, in Example 0, the input's last row has a 4 followed by zeros. The output's last row is all zeros. So maybe the last row is completely zeroed out, and all other rows have their non-zero elements doubled.\n\nLet me test this hypothesis against both examples.\n\nExample 0 Input:\n\nRow 0: all zeros \u2192 remains zeros.\nRow 1: [0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0] \u2192 becomes [0,4,4,4,0,0,0].\nRow 2: [0,0,2,0...] \u2192 [0,0,4,0...].\nRow 3: [0,2,2,2,2...] \u2192 [0,4,4,4,4...].\nAnd so on. Then the last row (row 6) becomes all zeros. That matches the output.\n\nSame for Example 1: all rows except the last have their numbers doubled (3\u21926), and the last row (with 6) becomes all zeros.\n\nSo the rule seems to be:\n\n1. For each row except the last (bottom) row, replace each non-zero number by twice its value.\n2. For the last row, replace all elements with 0.\n\nNow, applying this to the test input.\n\nTest input:\n\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0] \u2192 row 0: remains all zeros.\nRow 1: [0,8,8,8,0,0,0] \u2192 double to [0,16,16,16,0,0,0].\nRow 2: [0,8,8,8,8,8,0] \u2192 [0,16,16,16,16,16,0].\nRow 3: [0,0,0,8,8,0,0] \u2192 [0,0,0,16,16,0,0].\nRow 4: [0,0,8,8,0,0,0] \u2192 [0,0,16,16,0,0,0].\nRow 5: [0,0,8,8,8,0,0] \u2192 [0,0,16,16,16,0,0].\nRow 6 (last row): [2,0,0,0,0,0,0] \u2192 becomes all zeros.\n\nSo the output should have all rows except the last doubled, and the last row zeros. Let's check that.\n\nWait, but wait, in the training examples, the last row of the input had a single non-zero element (4 and 6), but in the output, the entire last row is zero. So the test input's last row is [2,0,...], so according to the pattern, the entire last row becomes zeros, regardless of the original numbers. So the test input's output last row would be [0,0,0,0,0,0,0].\n\nSo putting it all together, the test output should be:\n\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[0,16,16,16,0,0,0]\n[0,16,16,16,16,16,0]\n[0,0,0,16,16,0,0]\n[0,0,16,16,0,0,0]\n[0,0,16,16,16,0,0]\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nWait, but wait in the training examples, the output rows have the same structure as the input except for doubling and the last row. Let's check:\n\nIn Example 0's input, row 1 has 3 elements of 2, output has 3 elements of 4. Similarly, the test input's row 1 has 8s, which would become 16s. The same for other rows. So yes, each non-zero element in the first six rows is doubled, and the last row is all zeros.\n\nSo the final answer should follow this pattern."
