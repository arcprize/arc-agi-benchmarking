        "cot_1": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. So, looking at the training examples, I need to see how the input arrays are transformed into the output. Let's start with Example 0.\n\nIn Example 0, the input is a 5x5 grid. The output seems to have some elements shifted or rotated. Let me compare row by row. The first input row is [2,7,8,8,8], and the output first row is [2,7,5,5,5]. Wait, where did those 5s come from? Looking at the second input row is [5,5,6,5,4]. Maybe there's a rotation going on here. Let me check the columns.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each element is replaced by another element in a specific direction. Let's see the original matrix and the transformed one. For example, in the input's first row, the last three 8s become three 5s in the output's first row. The 5s in the second row of the input are from the same column but maybe shifted up or down. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe it's a clockwise rotation of certain elements. Let's see. For Example 0's input, perhaps the non-border elements are being rotated. Or maybe each element is being rotated in a specific way. Alternatively, maybe each layer of the matrix is rotated. For instance, the outermost layer stays the same, and inner layers rotate. But Example 0 is 5x5, so maybe there are layers, and the inner layers are rotated.\n\nWait, the output for Example 0's first row is [2,7,5,5,5]. The original first row ends with three 8s. The output's first row ends with three 5s. The 5s come from the second row's elements. So, perhaps the third element in the first row (8) is replaced by the element below it (5). Then the fourth element (8) is replaced by the element below that (6), but wait no, the second row is [5,5,6,5,4], so the third element is 6. Wait, maybe it's a shift to the right. Hmm, not sure.\n\nLet me check another example. Example 1 has a 3x3 input. The output's first row is [3,8,1]. The original first row is [3,5,1]. The middle element 5 becomes 8, which is from the second row's third element (8). The output's second row is [4,8,5], which was originally [4,5,8]. So here, the middle element becomes 8 again. Wait, perhaps the middle element is replaced by the element that's below it. Wait, in Example 1's input, the center element is 5 (from row 2, column 2). In the output, it's 8. The original row 2, column 3 is 8. Hmm. Maybe there's a rotation of elements in a certain way. For a 3x3 matrix, maybe the center element is replaced by the element to the right or something else.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern involves swapping elements in a spiral or some other pattern. Let me check Example 2. Input is 3x3:\n\nInput:\n[6,5,3]\n[5,7,5]\n[8,8,2]\n\nOutput:\n[6,8,3]\n[8,7,8]\n[5,5,2]\n\nThe first row's middle element (5) becomes 8. The second row's first element becomes 8 (originally 5), middle is 7 (same), third becomes 8 (originally 5). Third row's first becomes 5 (originally 8), second 5 (originally 8). So perhaps elements are being rotated in a clockwise manner around the center. Let's see:\n\nIn Example 2's output, the elements around the center (7) might be rotated. Let's see:\n\nOriginal positions around center (positions (0,1), (1,2), (2,1), (1,0)):\n\nOriginal (0,1) is 5, (1,2) is 5, (2,1) is 8, (1,0) is 5.\n\nIn the output, (0,1) becomes 8 (from (1,0) original 5?), (1,2) becomes 8 (from (2,1) original 8?), (2,1) becomes 5 (from (1,2) original 5?), (1,0) becomes 8 (from (0,1) original 5?). Wait, this seems like a clockwise rotation of the elements around the center. Let's check:\n\nOriginal surrounding elements (clockwise from top):\n\nTop: 5 (0,1)\nRight:5 (1,2)\nBottom:8 (2,1)\nLeft:5 (1,0)\n\nAfter rotation clockwise, the top becomes the left (5 \u2192 5?), but in the output, (0,1) is 8, which was originally the left (1,0) which is 5. Hmm, that doesn't fit. Maybe it's a different rotation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each element is replaced by the element that is one position to the right, wrapping around. But in Example 2's first row, 6,8,3. Original first row is 6,5,3. The 5 becomes 8. The 8 in output's (0,1) comes from where? The original (1,0) is 5. So maybe it's moving elements from the lower row into upper positions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each element (i,j) is replaced with the element from (i+1, j-1), but with some wrapping. Let's test for Example 2's (0,1) \u2192 8. Original (i+1, j-1) would be (1,0), which is 5. So that gives 5, but output is 8. So that's not it.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's a 90-degree rotation of the entire matrix, but that would change the structure entirely. For example, in Example 1's input:\n\nOriginal:\n3 5 1\n4 5 8\n2 4 9\n\nOutput:\n3 8 1\n4 8 5\n2 4 9\n\nThe center element 5 becomes 8. The 8 in output's (0,1) comes from (1,2) which is 8. The output's (1,1) is 8, which was (1,2) in input? Maybe not. Let's look at each position in the output:\n\nIn Example 1's output, (0,1) is 8. Input's (1,2) is 8. So maybe elements are shifted such that each element (i,j) is replaced by (i+1,j+1) mod matrix dimensions. For example, (0,1) would take from (1,2). But (1,2) is 8. So that's possible. Similarly, (1,1) in output is 8. Original (2,2) is 9. That doesn't fit. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the elements are being shifted in a way that each element is replaced by the element to the right and below. Or perhaps each element is replaced by the element diagonally opposite.\n\nAlternatively, looking for a pattern where each element is replaced by the maximum of its neighbors. For instance, in Example 1, the center element (5) is replaced by 8, which is the maximum of its neighbors. Let's check:\n\nOriginal center (1,1) is 5. Neighbors are 5 (above), 4 (left), 5 (right), 4 (below). Max is 5, but output is 8. So that's not it.\n\nAnother approach: look for the movement of specific elements. For example, in Example 1's input, the 8 is at (1,2). In the output, 8 is at (0,1) and (1,1). So maybe the 8 is moving to those positions. How?\n\nWait, let's check Example 0's input and output. The original first row has three 8s. In the output, those are replaced by 5,5,5. The 5s come from the row below. So the first row's third, fourth, fifth elements (8,8,8) become 5,5,5. The second row's elements are 5,5,6,5,4. So the third element is 6. Wait, why 5s? That doesn't match. Unless there's a shift upwards. For example, the elements in the first row's third position (8) is replaced by the element below it (5 from second row, third position is 6? Wait, the second row's third element is 6. So maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is to rotate each ring of the matrix. For a 5x5 matrix, there are two rings. The outermost ring and the inner ring. Let's see:\n\nIn Example 0's input, the outermost ring elements would be the first and last rows and columns. The output's first row is [2,7,5,5,5]. The original first row was [2,7,8,8,8]. The last three elements changed from 8,8,8 to 5,5,5. The 5s are from the second row's third, fourth, fifth elements, which are 6,5,4. Wait, that doesn't match. So maybe the inner ring is rotated. The inner ring in a 5x5 matrix would be a 3x3 matrix. But this is getting complicated.\n\nAlternatively, looking at Example 2's output, the elements around the center (7) are rotated. For instance, the top (5) becomes 8, right (5) becomes 8, bottom (8) becomes 5, left (5) becomes 8. Wait, that's a clockwise rotation. Let me check:\n\nOriginal positions around the center (positions (0,1), (1,2), (2,1), (1,0)):\n\nOriginal values: 5,5,8,5.\n\nIf rotated clockwise, they would become 5 (from left), 5 (from top), 8 (from right), 5 (from bottom). But in the output, (0,1) is 8, (1,2) is 8, (2,1) is 5, (1,0) is 8. So perhaps the elements are rotated such that each element moves to the next position in a clockwise manner. So the left (5) moves to top, top (5) moves to right, right (5) moves to bottom, bottom (8) moves to left. But then the new values would be top:5, right:5, bottom:8, left:8. Which doesn't match the output. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each layer is rotated 180 degrees. Not sure.\n\nLet's try to see if there's another pattern. For Example 0, the output's third row is [5,5,4,3,6]. The input's third row is [8,5,5,5,2]. Wait, maybe each row is transformed in a certain way. For example, the first element of each row is taken from the row above. Or perhaps each element is shifted diagonally.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps the transformation is that each element is replaced by the element that is one row down and one column to the left, wrapping around if necessary. Let's test this for Example 1.\n\nIn Example 1's input, the element (0,1) is 5. One row down and column left would be (1,0) which is 4. But in the output, (0,1) is 8. So that's not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each element is replaced by the element from the next row's next column. For example, (i,j) becomes (i+1, j+1). But for (0,1) in Example 1, that would be (1,2) which is 8, which matches the output. Let's check other elements. (0,0) would become (1,1) which is 5. But output is 3. So no. Doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's a diagonal shift. For example, elements are shifted such that each element (i,j) is replaced by (i-1, j+1) mod n. Let's try in Example 1. For (0,1), (i-1, j+1) would be (-1,2) mod 3 which is (2,2), which is 9. Output is 8. So no.\n\nHmm. Let me think differently. Looking at the outputs, perhaps the transformation involves swapping certain elements. For instance, in Example 0, the third element of the first row (8) is replaced by 5, which is the third element of the second row (6?), no. Wait, the second row's third element is 6, but in the output's first row, third element is 5. That's confusing.\n\nLooking at Example 2's input and output:\n\nInput:\n6 5 3\n5 7 5\n8 8 2\n\nOutput:\n6 8 3\n8 7 8\n5 5 2\n\nThe first row's middle element (5) becomes 8 (from third row's first element 8?), the second row's first element (5) becomes 8 (from third row's first?), third element (5) becomes 8 (from third row's second 8?), third row's first and second become 5 and 5 (from first row's 5 and second row's 5?).\n\nThis seems like elements are being rotated from the lower rows to the upper rows. For example, the 8s from the third row are moving up into the first and second rows. Let me check:\n\nThird row's first element (8) goes to first row's middle (5 \u21928). Third row's second element (8) goes to second row's third (5 \u21928). Second row's first (5) goes to third row's first (8 \u21925). First row's middle (5) goes to third row's second (8 \u21925?). Hmm, but how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the elements are being rotated clockwise around the matrix. For example, for Example 2:\n\nOriginal matrix:\n6 5 3\n5 7 5\n8 8 2\n\nAfter rotating 90 degrees, the matrix would transpose and reverse each row. But the output doesn't match that.\n\nAlternatively, consider that each row is shifted in a certain way. For example, in Example 1's output, the second row becomes [4,8,5], which was [4,5,8] in input. So the middle element is now 8 (from the third column's 8), and the third element is 5 (from the original middle 5). So perhaps the middle column is swapped with another column.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each element is replaced by the element diagonally opposite. For a 3x3 matrix, the diagonal opposite of (i,j) is (2-i, 2-j). Let's test Example 1's (0,1) which is 5. Diagonally opposite is (2,1), which is 4. But the output is 8. Doesn't fit.\n\nWait, let's look for a pattern where each element (i,j) is replaced by the element (j,i) transposed. But transposing Example 1's input would give:\n\n3 4 2\n5 5 4\n1 8 9\n\nWhich doesn't match the output. So that's not it.\n\nAnother angle: perhaps the maximum element in each row is moved to the center, but that seems not consistent.\n\nLooking at Example 0's output, the third row is [5,8,8,8,2]. The input's third row is [8,5,5,5,2]. So the first element changed from 8 to 5. Where does that 5 come from? The second row's first element is 5. So maybe elements are shifted upwards. For example, each element (i,j) is replaced by the element (i-1, j) from above. But then the first row would take from the last row, which isn't the case here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern where the matrix is divided into quadrants and each quadrant is rotated or shifted. But with varying matrix sizes, that might not be consistent.\n\nWait, looking at Example 0's output:\n\n[2,7,5,5,5]\n[8,8,6,8,4]\n[5,8,8,8,2]\n[5,5,4,3,6]\n[6,8,1,9,3]\n\nComparing to the input:\n\nInput row 0: [2,7,8,8,8]\nOutput row 0: [2,7,5,5,5]\nSo the last three elements became 5,5,5. Where are those 5s coming from? The second row (input row 1) is [5,5,6,5,4]. So the third element is 6, fourth is 5, fifth is 4. So the output row 0's third element is 5, which matches row1's fourth element (5). Then the fourth element of row0 output is 5, which is row1's fifth element (4)? No. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each element (i,j) in the output is taken from (i+1,j) of the input. So row0 would take from row1. Let's see: row0 of output is [2,7,5,5,5]. Input row1 is [5,5,6,5,4]. So the third element would be 6, but output's third element is 5. Doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. This is getting tricky. Let's try another approach. Maybe the pattern involves replacing each element with the element from the position that is one step clockwise in a concentric square around the center of the matrix.\n\nFor example, in a 5x5 matrix, the outermost ring is rotated clockwise. Then the next inner ring is also rotated. Let's check Example 0.\n\nOriginal input's first row (outer ring) is [2,7,8,8,8]. If rotated clockwise, the elements of the outer ring would shift. For a 5x5 matrix, rotating the outer ring clockwise would involve moving each element to the next position in the ring. For example, the top row's elements (except last) move right, the last element moves down, etc. But I'm not sure how this would look. Let me think:\n\nThe outer ring in a 5x5 matrix would be the perimeter. Rotating it clockwise would shift each element one position along the perimeter. For instance, the element at (0,0) moves to (0,1), (0,1) to (0,2), etc., but this might not be correct. Alternatively, rotating the entire ring once. For example, the first row becomes the last column, the last column becomes the last row reversed, etc. But the output's first row is [2,7,5,5,5], which suggests that the outer ring isn't rotated. The first element is still 2, the second 7. So maybe the outer ring remains the same, and the inner rings are rotated.\n\nThe third element of the first row in output is 5, which might be part of an inner ring. Let's see the inner 3x3 matrix in Example 0's input:\n\nThe inner 3x3 is from row 1 to 3 and column 1 to 3 (assuming 0-based index):\n\nRows 1-3 (indexes 1,2,3) and columns 1-3 (indexes 1,2,3):\n\nRow 1: [5,6,5]\nRow 2: [5,5,5]\nRow 3: [8,4,3]\n\nWait, the input rows 1-3 for columns 1-3 would be:\n\nRow1: [5,6,5,5,4] \u2192 columns 1-3 are 5,6,5?\n\nWait, maybe I'm getting the indexes wrong. For a 5x5 matrix, the inner ring after the outermost would start at (1,1) and end at (3,3). The elements in this inner ring would form a 3x3 matrix. Let's see:\n\nOriginal inner 3x3:\n\nRow1: [5,6,5]\nRow2: [5,5,5]\nRow3: [8,4,3]\n\nIf we rotate this inner 3x3 matrix clockwise by 90 degrees, the rows would become columns reversed. Let's see:\n\nAfter rotation, the inner 3x3 would be:\n\nRow1:8,5,5\n\nRow2:4,5,6\n\nRow3:3,5,5\n\nBut how does this fit into the output? The output's rows 1-3 in columns 1-3 are:\n\nOutput row1: [8,6,8]\n\nOutput row2: [5,8,8]\n\nOutput row3: [5,4,3]\n\nHmm, not sure. Alternatively, maybe the inner ring is rotated 180 degrees. But this is getting complicated. Maybe this approach isn't the right one.\n\nLooking back at Example 1's input:\n\nInput:\n3 5 1\n4 5 8\n2 4 9\n\nOutput:\n3 8 1\n4 8 5\n2 4 9\n\nThe changes are in positions (0,1) and (1,1) and (1,2). The 5 at (0,1) becomes 8, which is the value from (1,2). The 5 at (1,1) becomes 8, which is from (1,2) again. The 8 at (1,2) becomes 5. So maybe each element is replaced by the element to the right and below. Wait, (0,1) replaced by (1,2) which is 8. (1,1) replaced by (2,2) which is 9, but output is 8. Doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, the value 8 is moving from (1,2) to (0,1) and (1,1). So maybe there's a swap between (0,1) and (1,2), and between (1,1) and (1,2). Not sure.\n\nIn Example 2's output, the first row's middle element is 8, which was 5 in input. The output's (0,1) is 8, which comes from the third row's first element (8). The output's second row's first element is 8 (from third row's first?), and third element is 8 (from third row's second 8). The third row's first becomes 5 (from second row's first 5?), and second becomes 5 (from first row's second 5?).\n\nThis seems like elements from lower rows are moving up into certain positions, and elements from upper rows are moving down. Like a rotation of elements in a specific pattern. For example, in Example 2:\n\nOriginal third row: [8,8,2]\n\nOutput first row: [6,8,3] \u2192 8 from third row's first element.\n\nOutput second row: [8,7,8] \u2192 first and third elements are 8 from third row's first and second.\n\nThird row becomes [5,5,2] \u2192 first two elements 5, which were from original second row's first (5) and first row's second (5).\n\nSo maybe there's a swapping between elements in the same column but different rows. For example, elements in the third row are moving up to replace elements in the first and second rows. Specifically, the third row's first element replaces first row's second, third row's second replaces second row's third, etc. \n\nBut how does this form a general pattern applicable to all examples?\n\nAlternatively, maybe each even-numbered row (0, 2, 4) takes elements from the row below, and odd-numbered rows take elements from above. But in Example 0's input:\n\nRow 0 (even) takes elements from row 1 (below). So row 0's third element (8) becomes 5 (row 1's third element is 6, which doesn't match). So that doesn't work.\n\nAlternatively, elements are shifted in a way that each element (i,j) is replaced by the element (j,i) from the transpose, but this would transpose the matrix. However, the output isn't a transpose. For Example 1's input, transpose would be:\n\n3 4 2\n5 5 4\n1 8 9\n\nBut output is different.\n\nAnother idea: maybe each element is replaced by the element diagonally opposite across the center. For Example 1's 3x3 matrix, the center is (1,1). The element (0,1) is diagonally opposite to (2,1). Original (2,1) is 4. Output (0,1) is 8. No match.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the pattern is to replace each element with the sum or product of its neighbors. But in Example 1's center element 5 becomes 8, which is the same as the element to its right (8). So maybe each element is replaced by the maximum of its adjacent elements. Let's check:\n\nIn Example 1's (0,1) which is 5. Adjacent elements are 3 (left), 1 (right), 5 (below). Max is 5. But output is 8. So no.\n\nHmm. This is challenging. Let's look for another approach. Maybe the transformation involves moving elements in a diamond shape or some other structure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each element is shifted right by one position, with the last element wrapping to the next row. For example, in Example 1:\n\nOriginal rows:\n\nRow0:3,5,1 \u2192 would shift to 1,3,5 \u2192 but output row0 is 3,8,1. Not matching.\n\nAlternatively, each row is shifted in a certain way. For Example 0, the first row ends with three 5s, which are from the second row's elements 5,5,6,5,4. But not sure.\n\nLet me try to look for a pattern where the output matrix's elements are a combination of elements from the input matrix, possibly in a diagonal or knight's move pattern.\n\nWait, looking at Example 2's output:\n\n[6,8,3]\n[8,7,8]\n[5,5,2]\n\nThe 8s in the first and second rows come from the third row's first and second elements. So the third row's elements 8,8,2 are moved up to replace certain elements. The first row's middle (8) is third row's first (8). The second row's first and third elements (8 and 8) are third row's first and second (8,8). So perhaps elements from the bottom rows are moving up into higher rows.\n\nSimilarly, in Example 1's output, the 8 from the third column of the second row moves up to the first row's middle and the second row's middle.\n\nSo perhaps the pattern is that each element (i,j) is replaced by the element from (i+1, j-1), if possible. Let's check for Example 2:\n\n(0,1) \u2192 (1,0). Input's (1,0) is 5. Output's (0,1) is 8. Not matching.\n\nAlternatively, (i,j) is replaced by (i-1, j+1), wrapping around. For Example 2's (0,1):\n\n(0-1, 1+1) = (-1, 2) \u2192 which would wrap to (2,2) in a 3x3 matrix. Input's (2,2) is 2. Output's (0,1) is 8. Doesn't match.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's a knight's move: two steps down and one step right. For Example 2's (0,1):\n\nTwo steps down (i+2) would be 2, j+1 would be 2. Input's (2,2) is 2. Output is 8. No match.\n\nThis isn't working. Let me think of another angle. Maybe the pattern involves rotating elements in a specific way. For example, the first element of the first row is kept, the rest are rotated. But I'm not sure.\n\nLooking at Example 1's input and output:\n\nInput row0: [3,5,1] \u2192 output [3,8,1]. The middle element 5 becomes 8, which is from input row1's third element (8).\n\nInput row1: [4,5,8] \u2192 output [4,8,5]. Middle becomes 8 (from row1's third element 8), third becomes 5 (from row1's middle 5).\n\nInput row2: [2,4,9] \u2192 output unchanged.\n\nSo in row1, the middle and third elements are swapped. And row0's middle is replaced by row1's third.\n\nSimilarly, in Example 2's input:\n\nRow0: [6,5,3] \u2192 output [6,8,3]. Middle replaced by 8 (from row3's first element 8).\n\nRow1: [5,7,5] \u2192 output [8,7,8]. First element replaced by 8 (from row3's first 8), third replaced by 8 (from row3's second 8).\n\nRow2: [8,8,2] \u2192 output [5,5,2]. First two elements replaced by 5s from row0 and row1's middle?\n\nNot sure. Maybe the pattern is that each element (i,j) is replaced by the element from (i+1, j-1) if available, otherwise from somewhere else. But in Example 1's (0,1) becomes 8, which is (1,2). So (i+1, j+1) for (0,1) gives (1,2), which is 8. Then (1,1) becomes 8 which is (2,2) which is 9. Doesn't fit. So perhaps (i+1, j) and (i, j+1) in some combination.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each element is replaced by the element from the row below and to the right. For Example 1's (0,1) \u2192 (1,2) which is 8. That works. For (1,1) \u2192 (2,2) which is 9, but output is 8. So no.\n\nHmm. Let's try to think of another approach. Let's look at the positions that change in each example.\n\nIn Example 0:\n\n- The first row's third, fourth, fifth elements change from 8,8,8 to 5,5,5.\n\n- The second row's first, second, fourth elements change from 5,5,5 to 8,8,8.\n\n- The third row's first element changes from 8 to 5, and the second from 5 to 8.\n\nIt seems like there's a swapping between certain elements. For example, the 8s in the first row are replaced with 5s, and the 5s in the second row are replaced with 8s. But this is happening in specific positions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a transformation where for each element, if it's part of a run of three or more identical numbers, those are rotated or replaced. But in Example 0's first row, there are three 8s. They become 5s. The second row has three 5s (elements 0,1,3), which become 8,8,8. So maybe when there's a run of three or more identical elements, they are replaced by another number that appears in the adjacent row. For example, the three 8s in row0 are replaced by 5s from row1. But row1 has 5s in columns 0,1,3. Not sure.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps the transformation is to reverse each row and then shift elements in a certain way. For Example 0's first row reversed is [8,8,8,7,2], which doesn't match the output.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation involves swapping the middle elements of the matrix. For Example 1's 3x3 matrix, the center 5 is replaced by 8. But where does the 8 come from? It's from the third element of the second row.\n\nThis is getting frustrating. Let's try to summarize the changes observed in each example:\n\nExample 0:\n- First row: 8,8,8 \u2192 5,5,5\n- Second row: 5,5,6,5,4 \u2192 8,8,6,8,4\n- Third row: 8,5,5,5,2 \u2192 5,8,8,8,2\n- Fourth row: 8,8,4,3,6 \u2192 5,5,4,3,6\n- Fifth row: 6,5,1,9,3 \u2192 6,8,1,9,3\n\nNotice that the 8s and 5s are swapping in certain positions. Maybe it's a swap between 8 and 5 wherever they appear adjacent? Not sure.\n\nExample 1:\n- (0,1) 5 \u2192 8\n- (1,1) 5 \u21928\n- (1,2) 8 \u21925\n\nExample 2:\n- (0,1)5\u21928\n- (1,0)5\u21928\n- (1,2)5\u21928\n- (2,0)8\u21925\n- (2,1)8\u21925\n\nSo in Example 2, all 5s in the first and second rows are replaced with 8s, and the 8s in the third row are replaced with 5s. But why? This seems like a swap between 5 and 8, but only in certain positions. For example, the 5s in the upper rows become 8s, and the 8s in the lower rows become 5s. So perhaps there's a rule that replaces 5s with 8s if they're in certain positions and vice versa. But how does that apply across examples?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that each 5 is replaced by the element below it, and each 8 is replaced by the element above it. For example, in Example 1's (0,1) 5 is replaced by the element below it (row1, column1:5 \u2192 but output is 8). Doesn't fit.\n\nAnother approach: perhaps the transformation is to rotate the elements in the anti-clockwise direction for even layers and clockwise for odd layers. But this is getting too complex.\n\nWait, let's think about the movement of elements from the input to the output in terms of their positions. For Example 2:\n\nInput third row: [8,8,2] \u2192 Output third row: [5,5,2]. The 8s are replaced by 5s. Where do the 5s come from? The first and second rows' elements (row0, column1 is 5; row1, column0 is 5). So perhaps the 8s in the third row are replaced by 5s from above.\n\nThe 5s in the first and second rows are replaced by 8s from the third row. For example:\n\nOutput row0, column1:8 (from input row2, column0:8)\nOutput row1, column0:8 (from input row2, column0:8)\nOutput row1, column2:8 (from input row2, column1:8)\n\nSo it looks like elements from the third row's first and second columns are moving up to replace elements in the upper rows.\n\nSimilarly, in Example 1:\n\nOutput row0, column1:8 (from input row1, column2:8)\nOutput row1, column1:8 (from input row1, column2:8)\nOutput row1, column2:5 (from input row1, column1:5)\n\nSo the 8 from row1, column2 is moving up to row0, column1 and row1, column1. The 5 from row1, column1 is moving to row1, column2.\n\nThis suggests a pattern where certain elements are being moved upwards or to the left, possibly in a diagonal fashion.\n\nPutting this together, perhaps the transformation is that each element (i,j) is replaced by the element (i+1,j+1) if it exists, otherwise it wraps around. Let's test this:\n\nFor Example 2's (0,1):\n\ni+1=1, j+1=2 \u2192 element 5. Output is 8. Doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, (i-1,j-1) with wrapping. For Example 2's (0,1):\n\ni-1=2 (since it's a 3x3 matrix, 0-1=-1 \u2192 wraps to 2), j-1=0. So element (2,0) is 8. Output is 8. That fits. Similarly, (1,0):\n\ni-1=0, j-1=2 (wrapping). Element (0,2) is 3. Output is 8. Doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. This is getting too time-consuming. Let me try to find a different pattern. Maybe each element is replaced by the element directly below it, and the last row's elements are replaced by the first row's. For Example 0's first row's third element (8) is replaced by the element below it (6), but output is 5. So no.\n\nAnother idea: in Example 0, the output's first row has elements from the input's first row and second row. Perhaps for each element in the output, if it's in an even row, it's taken from the same column but the next row, and if it's in an odd row, taken from the previous row. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is a combination of transposing and swapping elements. For example, transposing the matrix and then swapping certain elements.\n\nAt this point, I think I need to look for a pattern that can be applied to all examples. Let's try to find a rule that works across all examples.\n\nIn Example 1's input:\n\n3 5 1\n4 5 8\n2 4 9\n\nOutput:\n\n3 8 1\n4 8 5\n2 4 9\n\nThe changes are in (0,1) and (1,1) and (1,2). The 8 comes from (1,2) and moves to (0,1) and (1,1). The 5 from (1,1) moves to (1,2).\n\nIn Example 2's input:\n\n6 5 3\n5 7 5\n8 8 2\n\nOutput:\n\n6 8 3\n8 7 8\n5 5 2\n\nThe 8s from the third row move to (0,1), (1,0), (1,2). The 5s from the first and second rows move to the third row.\n\nThis suggests that elements from the lower rows are moving up into positions diagonally above them, and elements from upper rows are moving down.\n\nFor example, in Example 2:\n\nThird row's first element (8) \u2192 first row's middle (8)\nThird row's second element (8) \u2192 second row's third (8)\nSecond row's third element (5) \u2192 third row's third (5)\nFirst row's middle (5) \u2192 third row's second (5)\n\nThis looks like a clockwise rotation of elements around the matrix's perimeter. For Example 2's 3x3 matrix, the perimeter elements are:\n\nRow0:6,5,3\nRow1:5,7,5\nRow2:8,8,2\n\nThe perimeter elements are 6,5,3,5,8,2,8,5.\n\nRotating these clockwise would shift each element one position. So the 6 moves to row0's 5's position, 5 moves to 3's position, etc. But this might not explain the changes accurately.\n\nAlternatively, for the perimeter elements, rotate them clockwise, so each element moves to the next position. For example:\n\nOriginal perimeter elements in order (top row left to right, right column top to bottom, bottom row right to left, left column bottom to top):\n\n6,5,3,5,8,2,8,5.\n\nAfter rotation, they become:\n\n5,6,5,3,5,8,2,8.\n\nSo the new perimeter would be:\n\nRow0:5,6,5\n\nRow1:8,7,3\n\nRow2:8,2,5\n\nBut this doesn't match the output.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and the lack of progress, I'll try to propose a hypothesis. The pattern seems to involve rotating certain elements in a clockwise manner around the matrix, perhaps the perimeter or inner layers. For Example 1's 3x3 matrix, rotating the perimeter elements clockwise by one position:\n\nOriginal perimeter:3,5,1,8,9,4,2,4.\n\nRotated clockwise:4,3,5,1,8,9,4,2.\n\nBut the output perimeter is 3,8,1,5,9,4,2,4. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the pattern is that each element (i,j) is replaced by the element from (j, i) in a different matrix. For example, the output is a combination of the original matrix and its transpose. But again, this doesn't seem to fit.\n\nWait, looking at Example 0's output:\n\nThe first row is [2,7,5,5,5]. The input's first row is [2,7,8,8,8]. The 5s come from row1's elements [5,5,6,5,4]. Specifically, the third element is 6, which becomes 5. So perhaps the element (i,j) is replaced by the element (i+1, j-1). For example, (0,2) \u2192 (1,1) which is 5. That works. (0,3) \u2192 (1,2) which is 6. But output's (0,3) is 5. Doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe (i,j) is replaced by (i+1, j+1) mod n. For Example 0's (0,2): (1,3) which is 5. Yes, output's (0,2) is 5. For (0,3): (1,4) which is 4. But output's (0,3) is 5. No.\n\nAnother approach: maybe each element (i,j) is replaced by the element (i+1, j) if possible, otherwise by (0,j) for the last row. For Example 0's (0,2): (1,2) which is 6. Output is 5. Doesn't fit.\n\nGiven that I'm stuck, I'll try to look for any pattern that could apply to all examples and lead to the test input's output.\n\nAnother observation: in all examples, the output matrices have the same elements as the input, but rearranged. No new numbers are introduced. So elements are being permuted.\n\nIn Example 0, the 8s in the first row are replaced by 5s from the second row. The 5s in the second row are replaced by 8s from the third row, and so on. This suggests a rotation where elements are shifted downward. For example, each row's elements are replaced by elements from the row below, with the last row wrapping around to the first. But in Example 0, the first row's last three elements (8s) are replaced by 5s from the second row. The second row's elements 5,5,6,5,4 become 8,8,6,8,4. The 8s could be coming from the third row's first element (8). But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe each element is replaced by the element diagonally below and to the right. For Example 0's (0,2): (1,3) which is 5. Output's (0,2) is 5. That works. (0,3): (1,4) \u21924. Output's (0,3) is5. No. Hmm.\n\nAnother idea: for each element, if it's even, replace it with the element below it. If odd, replace with the element to the right. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the transformation involves shifting each element's position in a certain way. For instance, each element moves down one row and to the right one column, with wrapping. For Example 0's (0,0) \u2192 (1,1) which is 5. Output's (0,0) is 2. No.\n\nAt this point, I'm not making progress. I'll try to look for a pattern that fits all examples and apply it to the test input.\n\nLooking at the test input:\n\nTest Input:\n[8,8,4,5]\n[3,8,7,5]\n[3,7,1,9]\n[6,4,8,8]\n\nExpected output based on pattern. Let's try to see what the pattern could be.\n\nFrom the training examples, especially Example 0, 1, and 2, the transformation seems to involve swapping elements between adjacent rows, possibly in a diagonal manner. For example, elements from the row below are moving up into the current row.\n\nAlternatively, looking at Example 1 and 2, the elements in the upper rows are getting values from the lower rows. For instance, in Example 1's output, the 8 from row1, column2 moves to row0, column1 and row1, column1.\n\nApplying that to the test input:\n\nTest input is a 4x4 matrix.\n\nFollowing the pattern from Example 1 and 2, perhaps elements from the lower rows (rows 2 and 3) are moving up into higher rows.\n\nFor example, the third row's elements [6,4,8,8] may move up into the second and first rows.\n\nAlternatively, if the pattern is to replace each element (i,j) with the element from (i+1, j-1) (mod rows and columns), let's try:\n\nFor row0, column0: 8 \u2192 (1, -1 mod 4) \u2192 (1,3) which is 5. So output row0, column0 would be 5. But this is a guess.\n\nAlternatively, if elements are rotated in a specific way. For example, each element (i,j) is replaced by (i-1, j+1) mod rows and columns.\n\nFor row0, column0: (3,1) \u2192 row3, column1 is 4. So output row0, column0 would be 4. But I don't know.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and the lack of a clear pattern, I'll have to make an educated guess based on the examples. \n\nIn the test input, a 4x4 matrix, perhaps each element (i,j) is replaced by the element (i+1, j-1) mod 4. Let's compute:\n\nFor element (0,0): (1,3) \u2192 5 (from row1, column3)\n(0,1): (2,0) \u21923 (row2, column0)\n(0,2): (3,1) \u21924 (row3, column1)\n(0,3): (0,2) \u21924 (row0, column2)\n\nBut this would make row0: [5,3,4,4]. Not sure if this matches.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the elements are rotated in a way that each element (i,j) is replaced by the element (i+1, j) from below, with the last row's elements coming from the first row. So row0 would take from row1, row1 from row2, etc.\n\nTest input's row0 would become row1's elements: [3,8,7,5]\n\nRow1 becomes row2's: [3,7,1,9]\n\nRow2 becomes row3's: [6,4,8,8]\n\nRow3 becomes row0's: [8,8,4,5]\n\nBut the output examples don't show such a simple shift. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps each element is replaced by the element one position to the right and one down. For example, (0,0) \u2192 (1,1) which is 8. So output row0, column0 would be 8. (0,1) \u2192 (1,2) which is7. (0,2)\u2192 (1,3) \u21925. (0,3)\u2192 (1,0) \u21923. So row0 becomes [8,7,5,3]. But I don't know if this is correct.\n\nGiven that I'm stuck, I'll look at the test input and try to apply a possible pattern based on the examples. In the training examples, it seems that elements from lower rows are moving up into upper rows, replacing certain elements. For example, in Example 2's output, the third row's 8s move up into the first and second rows. Similarly, in the test input, perhaps the third row's 8s (positions (3,2) and (3,3)) move up into the first and second rows.\n\nAlternatively, the output for the test input might be:\n\n[8,5,7,5]\n[3,8,8,9]\n[3,7,4,8]\n[6,4,1,8]\n\nBut this is a guess.\n\nAlternatively, let's try to apply the pattern observed in Example 0 and 2 where elements from the lower rows replace elements in the upper rows. For the test input:\n\nRow3 is [6,4,8,8]. Perhaps the 8s in row3 move up into row0 and row1.\n\nRow0's original elements are [8,8,4,5]. If the third element (4) is replaced by row3's third (8), and the fourth (5) by row3's fourth (8), then row0 becomes [8,8,8,8]. But that's not observed in the examples.\n\nAlternatively, elements from row3 are moved into row0 and row1, similar to Example 2.\n\nFor example:\n\nRow0's second element (4) is replaced by row3's third (8), making row0: [8,8,8,5].\n\nRow1's third element (7) is replaced by row3's fourth (8), making row1: [3,8,8,5].\n\nRow2's third element (1) is replaced by row3's first (6), making row2: [3,7,6,9].\n\nRow3 becomes [6,4,8,8] \u2192 perhaps some elements replaced.\n\nBut this is just a guess. Without a clear pattern, it's difficult to proceed.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and the need to provide an answer, I'll take a guess based on the following pattern observed in the examples: elements from the lower rows are moved up into higher rows, replacing certain elements. For the test input, this might involve moving elements from row3 to row0 and row1, and from row2 to row1.\n\nApplying this, the output could be:\n\n[8,8,8,5]\n[3,8,8,8]\n[3,7,1,9]\n[6,4,8,8]\n\nBut this is a guess. Another possible pattern is that each element (i,j) is replaced by the element (i+1,j-1) mod rows and columns. Let's try that:\n\nFor test input:\n\nRow0, column0: (1,3) \u2192 5\nRow0, column1: (2,0) \u21923\nRow0, column2: (3,1) \u21924\nRow0, column3: (0,2) \u21924\n\nSo row0 becomes [5,3,4,4]. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, if the pattern is to rotate each element from the row below:\n\nRow0 becomes row1: [3,8,7,5]\nRow1 becomes row2: [3,7,1,9]\nRow2 becomes row3: [6,4,8,8]\nRow3 becomes row0: [8,8,4,5]\n\nBut this would be a downshift, which doesn't match the examples.\n\nGiven that I'm not able to determine the exact pattern, I'll have to provide an answer based on the closest possible match to the training examples. Based on Example 2's 3x3 matrix, where the third row's elements move up, I'll assume that for the 4x4 test input, the third and fourth rows' elements are moved up into the first and second rows.\n\nFinal guess for test input's output:\n\n[8,5,4,5]\n[3,8,7,8]\n[3,7,8,9]\n[6,4,1,8]\n\nBut this is just a guess. However, looking at the examples, perhaps the pattern is to take elements from the next row and previous column. For example, (i+1, j-1). Let's try that for the test input:\n\nRow0:\n[ (1,3) \u21925, (2,0)\u21923, (3,1)\u21924, (0,2)\u21924 ]\n\nRow1:\n[ (2,3)\u21929, (3,0)\u21926, (0,1)\u21928, (1,2)\u21927 ]\n\nRow2:\n[ (3,3)\u21928, (0,0)\u21928, (1,1)\u21928, (2,2)\u21921 ]\n\nRow3:\n[ (0,3)\u21925, (1,0)\u21923, (2,1)\u21927, (3,2)\u21928 ]\n\nSo the output matrix would be:\n\nRow0: [5,3,4,4]\nRow1: [9,6,8,7]\nRow2: [8,8,8,1]\nRow3: [5,3,7,8]\n\nThis doesn't match any training examples' patterns. \n\nGiven the time I've spent, I'll settle on an answer based on rotating elements from the lower rows up. For the test input, the third row's elements 8,8 may move up into the second and first rows. The output might be:\n\n[8,8,8,5]\n[3,8,8,8]\n[3,7,1,9]\n[6,4,8,8]\n\nBut I'm not confident. Another possibility is that each even-indexed row's elements are replaced by elements from the row below, and odd-indexed rows by elements from the row above. For example:\n\nRow0 (even) replaced by row1: [3,8,7,5]\nRow1 (odd) replaced by row0: [8,8,4,5]\nRow2 (even) replaced by row3: [6,4,8,8]\nRow3 (odd) replaced by row2: [3,7,1,9]\n\nSo output would be:\n\n[3,8,7,5]\n[8,8,4,5]\n[6,4,8,8]\n[3,7,1,9]\n\nThis doesn't match the examples, though.\n\nAfter struggling, I think the pattern involves rotating elements around the matrix in a specific way, perhaps each element is replaced by the element from (i+1, j-1) with wrapping. For the test input:\n\nRow0: (1,3)=5, (2,0)=3, (3,1)=4, (0,2)=4 \u2192 [5,3,4,4]\nRow1: (2,3)=9, (3,0)=6, (0,1)=8, (1,2)=7 \u2192 [9,6,8,7]\nRow2: (3,3)=8, (0,0)=8, (1,1)=8, (2,2)=1 \u2192 [8,8,8,1]\nRow3: (0,3)=4, (1,0)=3, (2,1)=7, (3,2)=8 \u2192 [4,3,7,8]\n\nBut this doesn't match any training examples. I'm clearly stuck, but I'll have to provide an answer based on the best guess.\n\nLooking back at the training examples, especially Example 0 and 1, it seems that certain elements are being replaced by elements from the next row and same column or next column. For instance, in Example 1's (0,1) is replaced by (1,2). \n\nApplying this to the test input's first row:\n\n(0,0) remains 8.\n(0,1) is replaced by (1,2) \u21927.\n(0,2) is replaced by (1,3) \u21925.\n(0,3) remains 5.\n\nSo row0 becomes [8,7,5,5].\n\nRow1:\n\n(1,0) \u2192 (2,1) \u21927.\n(1,1) \u2192 (2,2) \u21921.\n(1,2) \u2192 (2,3) \u21929.\n(1,3) \u2192 (0,0) \u21928.\n\nSo row1 becomes [7,1,9,8].\n\nRow2:\n\n(2,0) \u2192 (3,1) \u21924.\n(2,1) \u2192 (3,2) \u21928.\n(2,2) \u2192 (3,3) \u21928.\n(2,3) \u2192 (0,0) \u21928.\n\nRow2 becomes [4,8,8,8].\n\nRow3:\n\n(3,0) \u2192 (0,1) \u21928.\n(3,1) \u2192 (0,2) \u21924.\n(3,2) \u2192 (0,3) \u21925.\n(3,3) \u2192 (1,0) \u21923.\n\nRow3 becomes [8,4,5,3].\n\nBut this gives:\n\n[8,7,5,5]\n[7,1,9,8]\n[4,8,8,8]\n[8,4,5,3]\n\nWhich doesn't match any examples. I'm clearly not getting this. \n\nGiven the time I've spent, I'll have to go with a pattern that seems to rotate elements from the lower rows into the upper ones, especially focusing on 8s and other numbers. For the test input, the third row's 8s may move into the first and second rows. The final answer might look like:\n\n[8,5,8,5]\n[3,8,8,8]\n[3,7,1,9]\n[6,4,7,8]\n\nBut I'm not confident. Alternatively, based on Example 0's 5x5 matrix where the first row's elements after the second are replaced by the second row's elements, perhaps the test input's first row's elements after the first two are replaced by the second row's elements. But this is just a guess.\n\nAfter all this, I think the correct approach is to look for a pattern where each element is replaced by the element diagonally below and to the right, which would explain some of the training examples. Applying this to the test input:\n\nFor element (i,j) in input, output is element (i+1,j+1) if exists, otherwise wraps around.\n\nBut in Example 1's (0,1) becomes 8 which is (1,2). For test input:\n\nRow0: [ (1,1)=8, (1,2)=7, (1,3)=5, (0,0)=8 ]\nRow0 output: [8,8,7,5]\n\nRow1: [ (2,1)=7, (2,2)=1, (2,3)=9, (1,0)=3 ]\nRow1 output: [3,7,1,9]\n\nRow2: [ (3,1)=4, (3,2)=8, (3,3)=8, (2,0)=3 ]\nRow2 output: [3,4,8,8]\n\nRow3: [ (0,1)=8, (0,2)=4, (0,3)=5, (3,0)=6 ]\nRow3 output: [6,8,4,5]\n\nSo the output would be:\n\n[8,8,7,5]\n[3,7,1,9]\n[3,4,8,8]\n[6,8,4,5]\n\nBut this doesn't match any training examples. I'm clearly missing something, but given the time constraints, I'll proceed with this answer.",

        "cot_2": "Okay, let's tackle this puzzle. So, the task is to figure out the pattern that transforms the input matrices into the output ones in the training examples, then apply it to the test input. Let me start by looking at each example carefully.\n\nStarting with Example 0. The input is a 5x5 matrix. Let me compare the input and output row by row.\n\nInput rows:\n[2,7,8,8,8]\n[5,5,6,5,4]\n[8,5,5,5,2]\n[8,8,4,3,6]\n[6,5,1,9,3]\n\nOutput rows:\n[2,7,5,5,5]\n[8,8,6,8,4]\n[5,8,8,8,2]\n[5,5,4,3,6]\n[6,8,1,9,3]\n\nHmm, looking for changes. Let's check each element. In the first row, the third element changed from 8 to 5, fourth from 8 to 5, fifth from 8 to 5. But where did those 5s come from? Looking at the second row of the input, the first elements are 5,5,6,5,4. Maybe there's a rotation or some kind of shifting going on.\n\nWait, perhaps elements are being rotated in a certain way. Let's check the second output row: [8,8,6,8,4]. The original second row was [5,5,6,5,4]. So the first two elements changed from 5,5 to 8,8. Where did those 8s come from? Looking up to the first input row's third and fourth elements, which are 8,8. Maybe there's a right or left shift here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the elements are being rotated in a clockwise or counter-clockwise manner around the matrix. Let me visualize the matrices. For example 0, the input matrix is 5x5. The output matrix seems to have elements shifted. For instance, the first row's last three elements (8,8,8) became 5,5,5. The third row's elements (8,5,5,5,2) in the input became [5,8,8,8,2]. So the first element became 5, which was the first element of the fourth row's input (which was 8). Wait, maybe there's a rotation where each row is shifted up or down, or elements are moved from adjacent rows.\n\nAnother approach: Let's look at the positions. For example, in the output matrix of Example 0, the first element of row 2 is 8, which was the first element of row 3 in the input. The first element of row 3 in the output is 5, which was the first element of row 4 in the input. Wait, input row 4 starts with 8, but output row3 starts with 5. Hmm, that doesn't fit. Maybe not a vertical shift.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the matrix is being rotated clockwise. Let's see. Rotating a 5x5 matrix 90 degrees would transpose and reverse rows. But the output doesn't look like that. For instance, original first row [2,7,8,8,8] would become the last column in a 90-degree rotation. Let's check: The output's first column is [2,8,5,5,6]. Original first column is [2,5,8,8,6]. So after rotation, maybe not.\n\nAnother possibility: Each element is replaced by an element from a neighboring position. For example, maybe each element is shifted right, and the last element wraps around to the next row. Let's check example 0's first row. Input row1: [2,7,8,8,8]. Output row1: [2,7,5,5,5]. So the last three elements became 5s. The 5s could come from the next row. Input row2 starts with 5,5,6,5,4. So perhaps the first three elements of row2 (5,5,6) are moved to the end of row1. But in output row1, the third, fourth, fifth elements are 5,5,5, which would be the first three elements of row2 but the first two are 5,5. Hmm, maybe not exactly.\n\nLooking at example 1:\n\nInput:\n[3,5,1]\n[4,5,8]\n[2,4,9]\n\nOutput:\n[3,8,1]\n[4,8,5]\n[2,4,9]\n\nLooking for changes. The middle element of row1 (originally 5) becomes 8. The middle element of row2 (5) becomes 8, and the third element of row2 (8) becomes 5. So there's swapping here. Where does 8 come from? Maybe from the element below. The middle element of row1 (5) is replaced by the element below it (from row2, column2:5 \u2192 but that's 5 again. Wait, in the output, row1's middle element is 8. So maybe the 8 is from row2's third element (8). But how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each element is replaced by the element from the position below and to the right, wrapping around. Let me check. For example1's output row0, column1 is 8. The input row0, column1 is 5. If we look diagonally down-right, from (0,1), moving down-right would be (1,2). Input's (1,2) is 8. So maybe that's it. Then, in example1, output row0[1] is 8, which is input (1,2). Similarly, output row1[1] is 8. Input (1,1) is 5. If we look diagonally down-right from (1,1), that would be (2,2), which is 9. But output here is 8, which doesn't match. So that's not it.\n\nWait, perhaps the elements are being rotated in a clockwise manner around the matrix. For example, in example1's input:\n\nRow0:3,5,1\n\nRow1:4,5,8\n\nRow2:2,4,9\n\nOutput:\n\nRow0:3,8,1\n\nRow1:4,8,5\n\nRow2:2,4,9\n\nLooking at the 5 in row0 column1 (input) becomes 8 (output). The 5 in row1 column1 becomes 8. The 8 in row1 column3 becomes 5. So perhaps elements in the middle are rotated. Let's see: The 5 in (0,1) goes to (1,2), the 5 in (1,1) goes to (0,1). Wait, in output row0, column1 is 8. Maybe it's not that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the middle element of each layer is rotated. Since it's a 3x3 matrix, the middle layer is the outer elements. Or perhaps the center is rotated. Let's see. The center in input is 5,5,4. Wait, no. The center elements are (1,1) in all three matrices. In example1, the input center is 5 (from row1, col1), and in output, it's 8. Where does 8 come from? The 8 in input is at row1, col3. Maybe there's a rotation of the middle ring. For a 3x3 matrix, the middle ring would be the outer elements. But I'm not sure.\n\nLooking at example2's input and output:\n\nInput:\n[6,5,3]\n[5,7,5]\n[8,8,2]\n\nOutput:\n[6,8,3]\n[8,7,8]\n[5,5,2]\n\nSo, in row0, the middle element 5 becomes 8. In row1, first element 5 becomes 8, and third element 5 becomes 8. Row2's first element 8 becomes 5, and the second 8 becomes 5.\n\nHmm. Let's see where those 8s come from. The 8 in row0, column1 (output) could be from row2, column0 (which is 8 in input). The row1, column0 in output is 8, which could be from row2, column0 (which is 8) but in output row1, column0 is 8. Wait, maybe elements are being moved from the row below. Like, each element is replaced by the element directly below it. Let's check:\n\nIn example2's input:\n\nRow0:6,5,3\n\nRow1:5,7,5\n\nRow2:8,8,2\n\nIf row0 takes elements from row1, and row1 from row2, and row2 takes from row0. But let's see:\n\nRow0 output is [6,8,3]. The 8 here would be from row1's column1 (7?) No. Or maybe from row2's column0 (8). If each element (i,j) in the output is taken from (i+1,j) in the input, except for the last row which wraps around. Let's test.\n\nOriginal row0 would take row1's elements. So output row0 would be [5,7,5], but the actual output row0 is [6,8,3]. So that's not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe shifting elements clockwise in a circular manner around the matrix. For example, in a 3x3 matrix, the outer elements are rotated. Let's imagine the perimeter of the matrix. The perimeter elements are the first row, last column, last row (reversed), and first column (reversed). Rotating them clockwise by one position. Let's try this for example2.\n\nOriginal perimeter elements (row0, row1, row2):\n\nRow0:6,5,3\n\nRow1:5,   ,5\n\nRow2:8,8,2\n\nThe perimeter elements are 6,5,3,5,2,8,8,5 (wait, maybe not. Let's list all perimeter elements:\n\nFirst row left to right:6,5,3\n\nLast column top to bottom (excluding first row's last element):5,2\n\nLast row right to left (excluding last element of last row):8,8\n\nFirst column bottom to top (excluding first element of first row and last element of last row):5.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's list all the perimeter elements in order: 6,5,3,5,2,8,8,5. Rotating them by one position clockwise would make the last element (5) move to the first position. So the new perimeter would be 5,6,5,3,5,2,8,8.\n\nBut how does this translate into the output matrix? Let's see the output for example2:\n\nOutput rows:\n\n[6,8,3]\n\n[8,7,8]\n\n[5,5,2]\n\nThe perimeter elements here are 6,8,3,8,2,5,5,8. Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, maybe each element is shifted to the right, and the last element wraps to the next row. Let's check for example2. Original row0:6,5,3. If shifted right, becomes 3,6,5. But output row0 is [6,8,3]. Not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each element is replaced by the element from the next row and same column, except for the last row, which takes from the first. So in example2:\n\nRow0 becomes row1's elements:5,7,5 \u2192 but output row0 is [6,8,3]. Not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the elements are being swapped in some pattern. For example, in example0, the third element of row0 becomes 5, which was the first element of row2. Let's see: row0, column2 in output is 5. Input row2, column0 is 8. No, that's not matching.\n\nWait, perhaps the pattern is that each element is replaced by the element diagonally to the right and below. For example, element (i,j) becomes (i+1,j+1). If that's the case, then:\n\nIn example1's input, (0,1) is 5. (1,2) is 8. So output (0,1) would be 8. Which matches. Similarly, in example2's input, (0,1) is 5. (1,2) is5. So output (0,1) would be5, but in the output it's8. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe elements are shifted in a certain way with wrapping. Let's think again about example1. The output for row0 is [3,8,1]. The middle 8 comes from the input's row1, column3 (8). Then row1 in output is [4,8,5]. The middle 8 comes from row2, column1 (4) \u2192 no. Alternatively, perhaps the middle elements are being swapped with elements from other positions.\n\nLooking at all the examples, maybe the pattern involves rotating certain elements in a specific way. Let me try to find a common pattern across the examples.\n\nIn example0's input, the output matrix seems to have elements that are shifted in a way that each row is a combination of the current and the next row. For instance, looking at row0 of output: [2,7,5,5,5]. The first two elements are the same as input row0, then the next three are from input row1's first three elements (5,5,6 \u2192 but output has 5,5,5. Hmm, not matching exactly. Alternatively, maybe taking the next row's elements starting from a certain position.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each row is shifted to the right by one, and the element that's pushed out is moved to the next row's start. For example, row0's last element 8 is moved to row1's first position, but in example0's output row1 starts with 8, which was row0's third element (8). So perhaps a rotation where each row's elements are shifted right, and the displaced elements are moved to the next row.\n\nLet me try this with example0. Original row0: [2,7,8,8,8]. Shifting right would make [8,2,7,8,8]. But output row0 is [2,7,5,5,5]. Doesn't align. Hmm.\n\nAnother approach: looking for the positions where numbers change and where the new numbers come from.\n\nIn example0:\n\nRow0: Original [2,7,8,8,8] \u2192 output [2,7,5,5,5]. The 5s might come from row1, which is [5,5,6,5,4]. The third, fourth, fifth elements of output row0 are 5,5,5, which are the first three elements of row1 (5,5,6) \u2192 but output has 5,5,5. Wait, maybe they are taking the first three elements of row1, but replacing 6 with 5. Not sure.\n\nRow1 input: [5,5,6,5,4] \u2192 output [8,8,6,8,4]. The 8s here might come from row2's first two elements (8,5). So output row1 starts with 8,8, which are row2's first two elements (8,5) but output is 8,8. Wait, row2's first two are 8,5. How does that become 8,8? Maybe the 5 is replaced by the next element in row2. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each row is being rotated right by two positions, but that doesn't fit.\n\nLet me try another approach. Let's look at all the test examples and see if there's a common transformation.\n\nLooking at Example0's output:\n\nOriginal elements:\n\nRow0: 2,7,8,8,8 \u2192 output 2,7,5,5,5\n\nRow1:5,5,6,5,4 \u2192 output 8,8,6,8,4\n\nRow2:8,5,5,5,2 \u2192 output 5,8,8,8,2\n\nRow3:8,8,4,3,6 \u2192 output 5,5,4,3,6\n\nRow4:6,5,1,9,3 \u2192 output 6,8,1,9,3\n\nHmm, notice that in the output, certain elements are replaced with 5s and 8s. Maybe there's a swapping between 5s and 8s, but not sure. For example, in row0, the 8s are replaced with 5s. In row1, the 5s are replaced with 8s. Row2's first element (8) becomes 5, and the next elements (5,5,5) become 8,8,8. So perhaps swapping 5 and 8 in certain positions.\n\nBut how to determine when to swap. Maybe in positions where 5 and 8 are adjacent. Or perhaps it's a rotation of certain elements in a way that involves 5 and 8.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that each row is shifted to the right, and the elements that overflow are placed into the next row, but in a specific way. For example, in example0, row0's last three 8s are moved to the beginning of row1. Then row1's original elements [5,5,6,5,4] would have the first two elements replaced by 8,8, and the rest shifted? Not sure.\n\nLet me check example1 again. Input:\n\nRow0:3,5,1 \u2192 output 3,8,1\n\nRow1:4,5,8 \u2192 output 4,8,5\n\nRow2:2,4,9 \u2192 output remains the same.\n\nSo the changes are in the middle element of row0 (5\u21928) and row1 (5\u21928, 8\u21925). So it looks like the middle element of row0 and row1 are swapped, but with something else. The 8 in row0 comes from row1's third element (8). Then, in row1, the third element becomes 5, which was the original middle element of row0. So maybe there's a swap between the middle element of row0 and the third element of row1. Let's see:\n\nOriginal row0's middle:5 \u2192 becomes 8 (from row1's third element 8).\n\nOriginal row1's third element:8 \u2192 becomes 5 (from row0's middle 5).\n\nYes, that's a swap between (0,1) and (1,2).\n\nBut also, row1's middle element (5) becomes 8. Where does that 8 come from? Oh, maybe also swapping with another element. Or perhaps it's a chain of swaps.\n\nAlternatively, in example1, perhaps the middle elements of each row are rotated. But there are three rows, so rotating middle elements: row0's 5 \u2192 row1's 5 \u2192 row2's4 \u2192 row0's5. But in the output, row0's middle is8, row1's is8, and row2's remains 4. That doesn't fit.\n\nWait, in example1's output, row0 middle is8 (from row1's third element), row1's middle is8 (from where?), and row1's third is5 (from row0's middle). So perhaps there's a rotation involving the elements (0,1), (1,1), (1,2). Let's see:\n\nOriginal positions:\n\n(0,1) =5\n\n(1,1)=5\n\n(1,2)=8\n\nAfter swapping:\n\n(0,1) takes 8 from (1,2)\n\n(1,1) takes 8 from somewhere else? No, because in output (1,1) is 8, but original (1,1) is5. Where does this 8 come from? It's possible that the 5 in (1,1) is replaced by the 8 from (1,2), and the 8 in (1,2) is replaced by the 5 from (0,1). So it's a three-way rotation: 5 (0,1) \u2192 8 (1,2), 5 (1,1) \u2192 8 (from where?), but maybe this is not the case.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the middle column is being rotated downward. Original middle column in example1 is [5,5,4]. Rotated downward would be [4,5,5], but the output's middle column is [8,8,4]. Doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. Let's look at example2's output.\n\nInput:\n\n[6,5,3]\n\n[5,7,5]\n\n[8,8,2]\n\nOutput:\n\n[6,8,3]\n\n[8,7,8]\n\n[5,5,2]\n\nThe changes are:\n\nRow0:5 \u21928\n\nRow1:5\u21928, 5\u21928\n\nRow2:8\u21925,8\u21925\n\nSo in row0, middle element becomes8 (from where?), row1's first and third elements become8, and row2's first and second become5.\n\nLooking at possible sources:\n\nRow0's middle element (5) becomes8. Where is there an8 nearby? In row2's first and second elements (8,8). Maybe each element is replaced by the element from two rows below. So row0's element (0,1) comes from row2's (0,1) \u2192 8. Similarly, row1's elements (1,0) and (1,2) come from row3 if it exists, but since it's a 3x3 matrix, maybe wrapping around. So row1's (1,0) would come from row0's (1,0) (which is5). But output row1's (1,0) is8.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps elements are being swapped with elements two positions down. For example, row0's (0,1) 5 is replaced by row2's (0,1) 8. That works. Then row1's (1,0)5 is replaced by row0's (1,0)5 (no), but output is8. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that for each cell (i,j), it's replaced by the cell (i+1,j+1) modulo the matrix size. For example, in example1:\n\n(0,1) \u2192 (1,2) \u2192 8\n\n(1,1) \u2192 (2,2) \u21929 \u2192 but output is8. Doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each element is replaced by the element below it, and the bottom row is replaced by the top row's elements. Let's test example2:\n\nRow0's (0,1)5 \u2192 row1's (0,1)7 \u2192 but output is8. No.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Let me try to find a common pattern across all examples.\n\nAnother observation: in all output matrices, the number of 5s and 8s seems to change. For example, in example0's input, there are several 8s and 5s, and in the output, they are swapped in certain positions. Maybe the transformation is swapping 5s and 8s in specific positions. But how to determine which positions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation involves rotating the matrix layers. For example, in a matrix, rotating the outer layer clockwise and the inner layers counter-clockwise or vice versa. Let's see.\n\nIn example0, a 5x5 matrix. The outer layer would include all elements on the first and last rows and columns. Rotating the outer layer clockwise would shift the elements. Let's see.\n\nOriginal outer layer of example0:\n\nRow0:2,7,8,8,8\n\nRow1:5,  , , ,4\n\nRow2:8, , , ,2\n\nRow3:8, , , ,6\n\nRow4:6,5,1,9,3\n\nThe outer elements are:\n\nRow0: all elements.\n\nRow1:5 (first), 4 (last)\n\nRow2:8 (first),2 (last)\n\nRow3:8 (first),6 (last)\n\nRow4: all elements.\n\nBut maybe for a 5x5 matrix, the outer layer is the first and last rows and the first and last columns. So the outer layer elements would be:\n\n2,7,8,8,8 (row0)\n\n5 (row1, col0)\n\n8 (row2, col0)\n\n8 (row3, col0)\n\n6 (row4, col0)\n\n5 (row4, col1)\n\n1 (row4, col2)\n\n9 (row4, col3)\n\n3 (row4, col4)\n\n8 (row3, col4)\n\n6 (row3, col4?)\n\nWait, this is getting messy. Let me visualize rotating the outer layer.\n\nIf we rotate the outer layer clockwise by one position, each element moves to the next position. For example, the element at (0,0) moves to (0,1), but that doesn't fit example0's output. Alternatively, a full rotation might move each element to the next position in a circular manner. For example, the first row becomes the last column reversed, etc. But this would significantly change the structure.\n\nAlternatively, the pattern could be that each row is rotated right by a certain number of positions, with the displaced elements moving to the next row. For example, row0 is rotated right by 3, so the last three elements (8,8,8) move to the start of row1, pushing row1's elements to the right. But let's check:\n\nExample0's row0 rotated right by 3 would be [8,8,8,2,7]. But output row0 is [2,7,5,5,5]. This doesn't fit. So perhaps not.\n\nAnother idea: Maybe the transformation is that for each row, the elements after the first two are replaced by the first elements of the next row. For example, in example0's row0, after 2,7, the next three elements are replaced by the first three elements of row1 (5,5,6). But output row0's last three elements are 5,5,5. Not matching exactly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the third element of each row is replaced by the first element of the next row. For example, in example0:\n\nRow0's third element (8) becomes row1's first element (5). Output row0's third element is5. Similarly, row1's third element (6) becomes row2's first element (8). But in output row1, third element is6, which stays the same. Hmm.\n\nThis is tricky. Let's try to see if there's a pattern in how individual elements are transformed across examples.\n\nTake example0's row0: [2,7,8,8,8] \u2192 [2,7,5,5,5]. The first two elements remain, the last three become 5s. Where do these 5s come from? The next row (row1) starts with 5,5,6,5,4. The first three elements there are 5,5,6. The output row0's last three are 5,5,5. So maybe the 6 is replaced by a 5. Not sure.\n\nExample1's row0: [3,5,1] \u2192 [3,8,1]. The middle 5 becomes 8. Where is there an 8? The element at row1, column2 is8. So maybe the middle element is replaced by the element two positions to the right and one down (i+1, j+2). But in a 3x3 matrix, j+2 would be j=0+2=2 (valid), j=1+2=3 (invalid). So for row0, column1 (5), i+1=1, j+2=3 \u2192 invalid. So that's not it.\n\nAlternatively, the middle element of row0 is replaced by the element from the next row's last element. In example1, row1's last element is8. So yes, that's where the 8 comes from. Then, row1's last element (8) becomes5, which was the original middle element of row0 (5). So this is a swap between (0,1) and (1,2). That fits example1.\n\nSimilarly, in example2's input, row0's middle element (5) is replaced by row1's last element (5 \u2192 no, but output is8. Wait, in example2's row1, the last element is5. So if there's a swap between (0,1) and (1,2), then example2's row0, column1 (5) would become row1's column2 (5), but in the output, it's8. So that doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. So in example1, it's a swap between (0,1) and (1,2). But in example2, maybe it's different.\n\nLooking at example2's input and output:\n\nRow0's middle element (5) becomes8. Where is 8 coming from? In the input, row2's first element is8. So maybe it's swapping with (2,0). So (0,1) swaps with (2,0). Then, row0's (0,1) becomes8 (from row2,0), and row2's (2,0) becomes5 (from row0,1). Let's see:\n\nIn example2's output:\n\nRow0:6,8,3 \u2192 8 at (0,1)\n\nRow2:5,5,2 \u2192 5 at (2,0) and (2,1).\n\nOriginal row2's elements were8,8,2. After swapping (0,1) and (2,0):\n\nRow0, (0,1) becomes8 (from row2,0:8).\n\nRow2, (2,0) becomes5 (from row0,1:5). So yes, that would work. Then, perhaps another swap is happening between (1,0) and (2,2).\n\nIn example2's input, row1,0 is5. Output row1,0 is8. Where does 8 come from? Row2's elements are8,8,2. So (2,2) is2. Not matching. Alternatively, maybe row1's last element (5) is swapped with row2's first element (8). So in example2:\n\nRow1,2 (5) swaps with row2,0 (8). So row1,2 becomes8, and row2,0 becomes5. That would explain row1's third element changing from5 to8, and row2's first element changing from8 to5. But row2's first element in output is5, and row2's second is5. So how does the second 5 come into play?\n\nAlternatively, there's a rotation of elements between rows. For example, row0's middle element is swapped with row2's first element, and row1's first and third elements are swapped with row2's elements.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Let's see if there's a general pattern that can be applied.\n\nAnother observation: In example0's output, row0's last three elements are 5,5,5 (from row1's first three elements). Row1's first two elements are8,8 (from row2's first two elements). Row2's first element is5 (from row3's first element), and row3's first two elements are5,5 (from row4's first two elements). Row4's second element is8 (from row0's third element).\n\nThis suggests a circular shift where each row's first few elements are taken from the next row's elements. For example:\n\nRow0's elements after position 2 are replaced by row1's first three elements.\n\nRow1's elements after position 2 are replaced by row2's first three elements.\n\nBut this is just a hypothesis. Let's check example0:\n\nRow0: elements 0 and 1 stay (2,7). Elements 2-4 become row1's first three (5,5,6). But in output, they are 5,5,5. So this doesn't fit. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, each row's elements after the first two are replaced by the previous row's elements. For example, row0's elements after position 2 are replaced by row4's first three elements. Not sure.\n\nLet me try another approach. Let's look for the positions where changes occur in each example and see if there's a common pattern.\n\nIn example0, the changes happen in the third, fourth, and fifth elements of row0; first and second of row1; first of row2; first two of row3; second of row4.\n\nIn example1, changes are in (0,1), (1,1), (1,2).\n\nIn example2, changes are in (0,1), (1,0), (1,2), (2,0), (2,1).\n\nIt's hard to see a pattern here. Maybe the transformation involves rotating certain layers or rings of the matrix.\n\nAlternatively, think of the matrix as layers. For odd-sized matrices, the center is a layer. For example, in a 3x3 matrix, there's the outer layer and the center. Rotating the outer layer clockwise or counter-clockwise.\n\nExample1's input:\n\n3 5 1\n\n4 5 8\n\n2 4 9\n\nThe outer layer elements are 3,5,1,8,9,4,2,4. Rotating this layer clockwise by one position would move 3 to the position of 4, 4 to 2, etc. Let's see:\n\nOriginal outer elements in order: top row left to right:3,5,1; right column top to bottom:8,9; bottom row right to left:4,2; left column bottom to top:4.\n\nRotated clockwise by one:4 (left column bottom) \u21923's position. Then the new order would be:4,3,5,1,8,9,4,2. But this doesn't seem to match the output. For example, the output's top row is3,8,1. So the middle element of the top row is8, which was originally in the right column (8). So if the outer layer is rotated, maybe the 8 moves into the top middle position. Let's see:\n\nAfter rotating the outer layer clockwise by one, the top row would be4,3,5. No. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, rotating the outer layer counter-clockwise by one. Let's see:\n\nOriginal outer elements in order:3,5,1,8,9,4,2,4.\n\nAfter rotation, the elements would shift to:5,1,8,9,4,2,4,3.\n\nSo the new top row would be5,1,8. Right column would be9,4. Bottom row would be2,4. Left column would be3. This doesn't match the output.\n\nAnother approach: perhaps the transformation is to rotate each even-indexed row to the right by one and each odd-indexed row to the left by one. Let's check example0:\n\nRows are 0-based. Even rows (0,2,4) are rotated right, odd rows (1,3) rotated left.\n\nRow0 (even): [2,7,8,8,8] rotated right by1 \u2192 [8,2,7,8,8]. Doesn't match output [2,7,5,5,5]. No.\n\nHmm. This is really challenging. Let's try to find another angle.\n\nLooking at example0's output, the third element of row0 is5, which matches the third element of row1's input (6). Not directly. Maybe each element is replaced by the sum of adjacent elements, but that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation involves taking elements from a diagonal. For example, in example0's output row0, the third element is5. Looking diagonally down-right from there, in the input, that's row1's column3 \u21925. So maybe it's taking elements from the diagonal.\n\nAlternatively, the transformation could be that each element (i,j) is replaced by the element (j,i) from the transpose matrix. But that would transpose the matrix, which doesn't fit the examples.\n\nWait, example0's output row1 is [8,8,6,8,4]. The input row1 is [5,5,6,5,4]. The first two elements are replaced with 8,8. The third element remains6. Fourth becomes8. Fifth remains4. Where do the 8s come from? The first two elements of output row1 are8,8. Looking at the input matrix's third row (index 2), which is [8,5,5,5,2], perhaps the first two elements (8,5) are taken. But in output row1, they become8,8. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a pattern where elements are replaced with the maximum value in their row or column. For example, in example0's row0, the last three elements are all8, which are the max in that row. In the output, they become5,5,5. The max in row1 is6. Not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the numbers are being shifted in a way that each number is increased or decreased based on some rule. For example, adding 3 modulo 10. But 8+3=11 mod10=1, which doesn't fit the output.\n\nAnother idea: Maybe the transformation is that each element is replaced by the element directly below it, except for the bottom row, which takes from the top. Let's check example1:\n\nRow0's middle element (5) would be replaced by row1's middle element (5), but in the output it's8. Doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. I'm stuck. Let's try to look for another pattern. Let's count the number of 5s and 8s in the inputs and outputs.\n\nIn example0's input, there are several 5s and 8s. Output has more 5s and 8s in different positions.\n\nExample1's input has two 5s and one8. Output has two 8s and one5.\n\nExample2's input has three5s and three8s. Output has two5s and four8s.\n\nIt's possible that the transformation involves swapping 5s and 8s in some way, but not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is that every occurrence of 5 is replaced with 8 and vice versa. But example0's input has many 5s and 8s. In the output, row0 has 5s where there were 8s, and row1 has 8s where there were 5s. So maybe swapping 5s and 8s. Let's check:\n\nIn example0's row0, input has three 8s which become5s. Row1's first two 5s become8s. This fits swapping 5 and8. But in row2, input has 8 followed by three 5s. Output has5 followed by three 8s. So yes, swapping 5 and8. Similarly, in row3, input has 8,8 which become5,5. And row4's 5 becomes8. So this fits.\n\nWait, if the pattern is to swap all 5s and 8s in the matrix, then:\n\nExample0's output would have 5s and8s swapped. Let's see.\n\nOriginal input:\n\nRow0: 2,7,8,8,8 \u2192 after swap: 2,7,5,5,5. Which matches the output.\n\nRow1:5,5,6,5,4 \u2192 becomes8,8,6,8,4. Matches.\n\nRow2:8,5,5,5,2 \u2192 becomes5,8,8,8,2. Matches.\n\nRow3:8,8,4,3,6 \u2192 becomes5,5,4,3,6. Matches.\n\nRow4:6,5,1,9,3 \u2192 becomes6,8,1,9,3. Matches.\n\nYes! So example0's output is the result of swapping all 5s and 8s.\n\nChecking example1:\n\nInput:\n\n[3,5,1]\n\n[4,5,8]\n\n[2,4,9]\n\nSwap 5s and8s:\n\nRow0:3,8,1\n\nRow1:4,8,5\n\nRow2:2,4,9\n\nWhich matches the output.\n\nExample2's input:\n\n[6,5,3]\n\n[5,7,5]\n\n[8,8,2]\n\nSwap 5s and8s:\n\nRow0:6,8,3\n\nRow1:8,7,8\n\nRow2:5,5,2\n\nWhich matches the output.\n\nYes! The pattern is swapping all occurrences of 5 and8 in the matrix. That explains all the training examples.\n\nNow, applying this to the test input:\n\nTest input:\n\n[8,8,4,5]\n\n[3,8,7,5]\n\n[3,7,1,9]\n\n[6,4,8,8]\n\nSwap 5s and8s:\n\nFirst row:5,5,4,8 \u2192 because 8 becomes5 and5 becomes8.\n\nWait, no. Wait, swapping means wherever there is a5, replace it with8, and wherever there is an8, replace it with5. So:\n\nOriginal test input:\n\nRow0:8,8,4,5 \u2192 becomes5,5,4,8\n\nRow1:3,8,7,5 \u2192 becomes3,5,7,8\n\nRow2:3,7,1,9 \u2192 remains the same (no 5 or8)\n\nRow3:6,4,8,8 \u2192 becomes6,4,5,5\n\nSo the output matrix should be:\n\n[5,5,4,8]\n\n[3,5,7,8]\n\n[3,7,1,9]\n\n[6,4,5,5]\n\nWait, but looking at the training examples, the swapping is between 5 and8. So each8 becomes5, each5 becomes8. So yes.\n\nSo the test input after swapping 5 and8 would give the above output."
