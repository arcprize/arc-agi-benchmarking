        "cot_1": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. So, looking at the training examples, each input is a 6x6 grid, and the output seems to have some numbers added around the original numbers. The original non-zero numbers in the input are mostly in the center, and the outputs have these blocks of repeated numbers in the corners or edges.\n\nStarting with Example 0. The input has 9 and 3 in the middle rows, and 7 and 8 in the next. The output has 8s and 7s on the top two rows, and 3s and 9s on the bottom two. Wait, the 8 and 7 are on the top, but the original middle numbers are 9,3 and 7,8. Maybe the numbers are swapped or mirrored somehow? Like the top part has the numbers from the bottom middle rows, but reversed. Let's see: in example 0's input, the third row has 9,3 and the fourth has 7,8. The output's top rows have 8 and 7, which might correspond to the fourth row's 7 and 8. Hmm, maybe each quadrant is mirrored or something.\n\nIn Example 1, the input has 4,6 and 2,1 in the second and third rows. The output's top left has 1, which might be from the 1 in the third row's position. The bottom left has 6 and 4, which could be from the original 4,6. So maybe the numbers are being rotated or transposed in some way.\n\nAnother approach: looking at the output grids, they seem to have 2x2 blocks of the same number. For example, in Example 0's output, the top left has 8s and the top right 7s. Similarly, bottom left has 3s and bottom right 9s. So maybe each 2x2 block in the corners is filled based on some relation to the original middle numbers.\n\nLooking at the positions of the non-zero numbers in the input and how they relate to the output. For example, in Example 0, the input's third row (middle) has 9 and 3. The output's bottom right corner has 9s, and the bottom left has 3s. Wait, 9 is in the third row's third column, and in the output, the bottom right has 9s. Maybe each non-zero number in the middle four rows (rows 2-5?) is being mirrored to the corners. Wait, rows are 0-indexed. So input rows 2 and 3 (third and fourth rows) have numbers. The output has 8 and 7 in the top, and 3 and 9 in the bottom. So maybe the numbers from the middle are being split into the four corners.\n\nLooking at example 0 again: the middle two rows have 9,3 and 7,8. The output's top left and right are 8,8 and 7,7. The bottom left and right are 3,3 and 9,9. So perhaps each of the four numbers from the middle is placed into a corner, but swapped. Like, 7 and 8 from the fourth row (row 3) become 8 in the top left and 7 in the top right. Then 9 and 3 from row 2 become 9 in the bottom right and 3 in the bottom left. So it's like each corner is taking a number from the middle, but rotated or swapped. Maybe it's a rotation of 180 degrees? Let's see. If you take the middle four cells (rows 2-3, columns 2-3) and rotate them 180 degrees, then the numbers would be placed in the corners. For example, in example 0, the middle cells are:\n\nRow 2: [9,3]\nRow3: [7,8]\n\nRotating 180 would make them:\n\nRow2 rotated becomes row3 reversed: 8,7\nRow3 rotated becomes row2 reversed:3,9\n\nThen, these rotated numbers are placed in the corners. The top left corner (rows 0-1, columns 0-1) has 8s. The top right (rows 0-1, columns 4-5) has 7s. The bottom left (rows4-5, columns0-1) has 3s. The bottom right (rows4-5, columns4-5) has 9s. So each pair of numbers from the rotated middle becomes the corners. So for example, the original middle cells after rotation would be:\n\n[8,7]\n[3,9]\n\nThen the top left uses the first element (8) as a 2x2 block, the top right uses the second (7), the bottom left uses the third (3), and the bottom right uses the fourth (9). So each of the four numbers from the rotated middle is placed in a corner as 2x2 blocks.\n\nLet me check this with example 1. The original input's middle (rows 1-2, columns1-2) has:\n\nRow1: [4,6]\nRow2: [2,1]\n\nWait, but in example1's input, the non-zero numbers are in rows 1 and 2. So maybe the middle is rows 2-3? Wait, in example0, the middle was rows 2-3, columns 2-3. But example1 has non-zero in rows1,2. Hmm, maybe the middle is defined as the central 2x2 cells. Wait, perhaps the middle 2x2 cells (rows 2-3, columns2-3) are the ones that are rotated 180 degrees. Let's check example1. But in example1's input, the non-zero numbers are in rows1 and 2, columns1-2. So that's not the middle 2x2. So maybe the middle 2x2 refers to the central part regardless of where the numbers are. But example0's input had non-zero in the middle 2x2. Maybe the pattern is that the middle 2x2 cells (rows 2-3, columns 2-3) are rotated 180, and their values are then placed in the four corners as 2x2 blocks. But in example1, the middle 2x2 would be rows2-3, columns2-3. Let's look:\n\nIn example1's input:\n\nRow2 (third row): [0,2,1,0,0,0]\nRow3 (fourth row): [0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nSo the middle 2x2 (columns2-3, rows2-3) would be:\n\nRow2 columns2-3: [1,0]\nRow3 columns2-3: [0,0]\n\nRotating 180 would flip the order of rows and reverse each row. So rotated, this becomes:\n\nRow3's columns2-3 reversed: [0,0]\nRow2's columns2-3 reversed: [0,1]\n\nSo the rotated middle would be:\n\n[0,0]\n[0,1]\n\nBut in the output for example1, the top left has 1 in the first row first column, but that's part of the 1,0,0,2,2,0. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the middle area. Let's look again. Maybe the middle is wherever the non-zero numbers are. Or perhaps the pattern is that the non-zero numbers are in a cluster, and that cluster is rotated 180, and the output's corners are filled with those numbers. \n\nAlternatively, let's think about the output's corners. In example0, the four corners are 8,7,3,9. The original numbers in the middle are 9,3,7,8. So 9 and 3 are in row2, 7 and8 in row3. When rotated 180, the order would be 8,7,3,9. So the top left is 8, top right 7, bottom left 3, bottom right 9. Each as 2x2 blocks.\n\nSimilarly, example2: input has 3,6 and5,2. Rotated 180, that becomes 2,5,6,3. Then the output's corners are 2,5,6,3. Top left 2, top right5, bottom left6, bottom right3. Which matches example2's output.\n\nExample1's input middle cluster is 4,6 (row1) and 2,1 (row2). So if rotated 180, the order would be 1,2,6,4. But in the output, the top left has 1, the bottom left has6,4. Wait, example1's output has top left as 1 and the bottom left as6, and the top right as2 and bottom right as4? Let me check:\n\nExample1's output:\n\nTop left: [1,0], [0,4...] No, the first row is [1,0,0,2,2,0]. The first two elements are 1 and 0, then 0,0,2,2. Wait, the output seems to have 1 in the top left, but maybe the 2x2 blocks are in the corners. For example, the top left corner (rows0-1, columns0-1) in example1's output is:\n\nRow0: [1,0]\nRow1: [0,4]\n\nWait, but that's not a 2x2 block of the same number. Hmm, this contradicts my previous thought. Maybe the pattern isn't exactly as I thought. Let's re-examine example1's input and output.\n\nExample1 input has:\n\nRow1: 0,4,6,0,0,0\n\nRow2:0,2,1,0,0,0\n\nSo the non-zero numbers are in rows1 and 2, columns1-2 (4,6,2,1). So the cluster is a 2x2 grid: 4,6; 2,1. Rotating this 180 degrees would give:\n\n1,2;6,4. Because rotating 180 flips both rows and columns. So the rotated 2x2 would be [[1,2],[6,4]]. Then, the four corners would be:\n\nTop left corner (rows0-1, columns0-1) filled with 1s? But in the output, the top left of example1 is [1,0,0,2,2,0]. Wait, row0 is [1,0,0,2,2,0]. The first two elements are 1 and 0. Then row1 starts with 0,4. So the top left 2x2 isn't filled with 1s. Hmm, maybe the rotated 2x2 is split into four parts. The rotated cluster (1,2,6,4) are placed into four quadrants. For example:\n\nTop-left quadrant: 1 and 2 (but how?), top-right: 2 and 2, bottom-left: 6 and 6, bottom-right:4 and4. But the output's top row has 1,0,0,2,2,0. So the top right has 2s. The bottom left has 6s. The bottom right has4s. So perhaps the rotated cluster is split into four numbers, each placed in a 2x2 block in the four corners. The top left corner's 2x2 block would be filled with the first number (1) from the rotated cluster. But in example1's output, the top left corner (rows0-1, columns0-1) has 1 in row0 column0, but row0 column1 is 0, row1 column0 is 0. So that doesn't fit. Maybe the rotated cluster's elements are placed in the corners in a different way.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each element of the rotated cluster is placed in a specific corner. For example:\n\nAfter rotating the cluster 180 degrees, the top-left element (original bottom-right) becomes 1. Then the top-right element (original bottom-left) becomes 2. The bottom-left (original top-right) becomes6, and the bottom-right (original top-left) becomes4. Then, these four numbers are placed in the four corners as 2x2 blocks. So the top-left corner (rows0-1, columns0-1) would be filled with 1s. The top-right (rows0-1, columns4-5) with2s. The bottom-left (rows4-5, columns0-1) with6s. The bottom-right (rows4-5, columns4-5) with4s. But looking at example1's output:\n\nThe output's first row is [1,0,0,2,2,0]. The top left 2x2 is [1,0;0,4], which doesn't fit. The top right 2x2 in columns4-5 is [2,0], but in rows0-1. So maybe the 2s are in the top right. Then the bottom left (rows4-5, columns0-1) has [6,6;6,6], which is present in rows4 and5. The bottom right would have [4,4;4,4], but in example1's output, the bottom rows are:\n\nRow4:6,0,0,4,4,0\n\nRow5:0,0,0,0,0,0\n\nSo the bottom left (rows4-5, columns0-1) is [6,6] and [0,0], which is a 2x2 block of 6s in row4, but row5 is zero. Hmm, this is getting confusing. Maybe the pattern is that the original cluster (the 2x2 in the input) is rotated 180, and each element becomes the corner 2x2 blocks. So the top-left corner of the output's 2x2 is the first element of the rotated cluster, the top-right is the second, bottom-left third, and bottom-right fourth.\n\nFor example, in example0:\n\nOriginal cluster (row2-3, columns2-3):\n\nRow2:9,3\n\nRow3:7,8\n\nRotated 180 becomes:\n\nRow3 reversed:8,7\n\nRow2 reversed:3,9\n\nSo the rotated cluster is:\n\n8 7\n\n3 9\n\nThen the four corners are filled with each element as 2x2 blocks:\n\nTop-left:8s (from 8)\n\nTop-right:7s (from7)\n\nBottom-left:3s (from3)\n\nBottom-right:9s (from9)\n\nWhich matches example0's output.\n\nIn example1, the original cluster is rows1-2, columns1-2:\n\nRow1:4,6\n\nRow2:2,1\n\nRotated 180 becomes:\n\n1,2\n\n6,4\n\nSo the four elements are 1,2,6,4. So:\n\nTop-left 2x2 blocks filled with 1.\n\nTop-right with 2.\n\nBottom-left with6.\n\nBottom-right with4.\n\nLooking at example1's output:\n\nTop-left corner (rows0-1, columns0-1) has row0: [1,0], row1: [0,4]. Wait, that's not all 1s. But the top-right corner (columns4-5, rows0-1) has 2s. So row0 columns4-5 are 2,2. Row1 columns4-5 are 0,0. So only the first row has 2s. Hmm, maybe it's not exactly 2x2 blocks for all. Or perhaps the output isn't always 2x2 blocks but sometimes adjacent. This complicates things.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rotated cluster is split into four elements, and each is placed in a corner as 2x2 blocks. So the top-left corner's 2x2 is filled with the first element, top-right with the second, bottom-left with the third, and bottom-right with the fourth.\n\nIn example1, the rotated cluster is 1,2,6,4. So:\n\nTop-left:1 \u2192 2x2 blocks of 1. But the output's top-left has a 1 in row0, column0, but row0, column1 is 0, and row1, column0 is 0. So that's not a 2x2 block. So this theory might be incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rotated cluster is split into four elements and placed as follows:\n\nTop-left corner (rows0-1, columns0-1) is filled with the first element (1) as 2x2 blocks.\n\nTop-right (rows0-1, columns4-5) filled with second (2).\n\nBottom-left (rows4-5, columns0-1) filled with third (6).\n\nBottom-right (rows4-5, columns4-5) filled with fourth (4).\n\nLooking at example1's output:\n\n- The top-left (rows0-1, columns0-1) has [1,0] in row0 and [0,4] in row1. So the 1 is only in row0 column0. Not a 2x2 block. But the top-right (columns4-5 in rows0-1) has [2,2] in row0 and [0,0] in row1. So row0 columns4-5 are 2s.\n\nThe bottom-left (rows4-5, columns0-1) has [6,0] in row4 and [0,0] in row5. So row4 columns0-1 are 6 and 0.\n\nBottom-right (rows4-5, columns4-5) has [4,4] in row4 columns4-5 and [0,0] in row5.\n\nHmm, this doesn't fit the pattern of 2x2 blocks. So maybe the 2x2 blocks are only applied in some cases. For example, if the rotated cluster's elements are non-zero, they form 2x2 blocks in the corners. But in example1, the cluster's rotated elements are 1,2,6,4. But in the output, the 1 is only in the first position, 2 in top right two positions, 6 in two positions in the bottom left, and 4 in two positions in the bottom right. So maybe each rotated element is placed in two adjacent cells, not as 2x2 blocks. For example:\n\nEach element is duplicated into two adjacent cells in their respective corners.\n\nWait, looking at example0's output:\n\nTop-left has two rows of [8,8], so 2x2 blocks. Similarly for others. But in example1's output, the top-right has two 2s in row0 columns4-5, but nothing in row1. Similarly, the bottom-left has two 6s in row4 columns0-1, but row5 is zero. So perhaps the rotated elements are placed as 2x2 blocks but only in the first or last rows where possible. Maybe the placement depends on the original cluster's position. Alternatively, perhaps the numbers are mirrored around the grid's center.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the original cluster is mirrored both vertically and horizontally, and then each corner takes a pair of numbers. For example, in example0, the original cluster is:\n\n9 3\n\n7 8\n\nMirroring horizontally and vertically (i.e., rotated 180) gives:\n\n8 7\n\n3 9\n\nThen the top-left corner (rows0-1, columns0-1) is filled with 8s, top-right with7s, bottom-left with3s, bottom-right with9s. Each as 2x2 blocks.\n\nIn example1's rotated cluster is 1 2 /6 4. Then top-left would be1s, top-right2s, bottom-left6s, bottom-right4s. But in the output for example1, the top-left has a 1 in row0,0 and 0s elsewhere. Maybe the 1 is in row0,0 and row0,1? No, example1's output row0 is [1,0,0,2,2,0]. So row0 has 1 and 0 in first two columns, then 0s and 2s. Hmm, this is conflicting.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the numbers are split into pairs and each pair is placed in a corner. For example, the first two numbers of the rotated cluster are placed in the top-left and top-right, and the last two in the bottom-left and bottom-right. But this is unclear.\n\nLet me try another approach. For each example, let's see where the output numbers are placed relative to the input's non-zero positions.\n\nExample0 input's non-zero are in rows2-3, columns2-3. Output's non-zero are in corners: top-left (rows0-1, columns0-1), top-right (rows0-1, columns4-5), bottom-left (rows4-5, columns0-1), bottom-right (rows4-5, columns4-5). Each of these corners has 2x2 blocks of a number. The numbers in the corners are the same as the numbers from the rotated cluster.\n\nExample2 input's cluster is rows2-3, columns2-3: 3,6 and5,2. Rotated 180 becomes 2,5 and6,3. Then output's corners are 2,5,6,3 as 2x2 blocks. Which matches the example.\n\nExample1's rotated cluster is 1,2 and6,4. So the output should have 1 in top-left, 2 in top-right, 6 in bottom-left,4 in bottom-right. But in the output, the top-left has 1 only in row0, column0, and 2 in row0 columns4-5. The bottom-left has 6s in row4 columns0-1, and bottom-right has4s in row4 columns4-5. But row5 is all zeros. So perhaps the placement is different when the cluster is not in the exact center.\n\nWait, maybe the position of the original cluster affects where the corners are placed. For example, if the original cluster is in rows1-2, then the output's corners are adjusted. Like, in example1's cluster is in rows1-2, columns1-2. Rotated 180, the numbers are placed in the outer corners. But how exactly?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is to take the 2x2 cluster in the input, rotate it 180 degrees, and then mirror each of its four elements into the four corners as 2x2 blocks. So each element of the rotated cluster is copied into a 2x2 block in a corner.\n\nIn example0, the rotated cluster is:\n\n8 7\n\n3 9\n\nEach element is placed into a corner:\n\n8 \u2192 top-left (2x2)\n\n7 \u2192 top-right (2x2)\n\n3 \u2192 bottom-left (2x2)\n\n9 \u2192 bottom-right (2x2)\n\nWhich works.\n\nIn example1, the rotated cluster is:\n\n1 2\n\n6 4\n\nSo 1 \u2192 top-left 2x2, 2 \u2192 top-right,6\u2192bottom-left,4\u2192bottom-right. But in example1's output, the top-left corner doesn't have a 2x2 of 1. Instead, row0 has 1 in column0, and row1 has 0s. So this doesn't fit. However, the output does have a 2x2 block of 6s in the bottom-left (rows4-5, columns0-1) in example1's output: row4 is [6,0,0,4,4,0], row5 is [0,0,0,0,0,0]. So row4's first two columns are 6,0. Not a 2x2 block. But in example0 and example2, the corners are 2x2 blocks. So maybe the difference is when the original cluster is not centered. Example1's cluster is higher up (rows1-2), so when rotated, the placement into the corners is adjusted. Maybe the 2x2 blocks are placed in the corresponding rows based on the original cluster's position.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that the numbers in the middle 2x2 (rows2-3, columns2-3) are rotated 180, and their values are used to fill the four corners as 2x2 blocks, regardless of where the original numbers were. But in example1, the original cluster isn't in the middle. However, looking at example1's input, the non-zero numbers are in rows1-2, columns1-2. So maybe the middle 2x2 (rows2-3, columns2-3) is still considered, but in example1, those positions are zeros. So that theory doesn't hold.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Maybe another approach is needed. Let's look at the test input:\n\nTest input:\n\n[0,0,0,0,0,0]\n[0,0,0,0,0,0]\n[0,0,0,0,0,0]\n[0,0,3,1,0,0]\n[0,0,2,5,0,0]\n[0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nSo the non-zero numbers are in rows3-4, columns2-3: row3 has 3,1 and row4 has 2,5. So the 2x2 cluster is:\n\n3 1\n\n2 5\n\nRotating 180 degrees would flip the order of the rows and reverse each row:\n\nOriginal rows:\n\nRow3:3,1\n\nRow4:2,5\n\nRotated 180 would make the rows reversed and each row reversed:\n\nRow4 reversed:5,2\n\nRow3 reversed:1,3\n\nSo the rotated cluster becomes:\n\n5 2\n\n1 3\n\nThen, each element is placed in the four corners as 2x2 blocks:\n\nTop-left:5s\n\nTop-right:2s\n\nBottom-left:1s\n\nBottom-right:3s\n\nBut wait, in the previous examples, the order was top-left, top-right, bottom-left, bottom-right. So from the rotated cluster, the elements are taken row-wise. So the rotated cluster's first row is 5,2 and second row is1,3. Then the elements are 5,2,1,3. So the four corners would be:\n\nTop-left:5 \u2192 2x2 blocks of 5s.\n\nTop-right:2 \u2192 2x2 blocks of 2s.\n\nBottom-left:1 \u2192 2x2 blocks of 1s.\n\nBottom-right:3 \u2192 2x2 blocks of 3s.\n\nBut looking back at the training examples, in example0, the rotated cluster was:\n\n8 7\n\n3 9\n\nWhich resulted in 8 (top-left),7 (top-right),3 (bottom-left),9 (bottom-right). So the order is first row first element, first row second, second row first, second row second.\n\nBut according to that, the rotated cluster elements are read left to right, top to bottom, and each is assigned to the four corners in the order top-left, top-right, bottom-left, bottom-right.\n\nSo for the test input's rotated cluster:\n\n5 2\n\n1 3\n\nThe elements are 5,2,1,3. So:\n\nTop-left corners (2x2) filled with5.\n\nTop-right filled with2.\n\nBottom-left filled with1.\n\nBottom-right filled with3.\n\nBut looking at the training examples, the bottom-left and bottom-right are in the lower rows. So in example0, the bottom-left 3s are in rows4-5, columns0-1. The bottom-right 9s are in rows4-5, columns4-5.\n\nSo applying this to the test input's rotated cluster:\n\nThe output's top-left would have two rows of 5s:\n\n[5,5, ... ]\n\n[5,5, ... ]\n\nThe top-right would have 2s:\n\n[... ,2,2]\n\n[... ,2,2]\n\nBottom-left would have1s:\n\n[1,1, ... ]\n\n[1,1, ... ]\n\nBottom-right would have3s:\n\n[... ,3,3]\n\n[... ,3,3]\n\nBut wait, the test input's original cluster is in rows3-4, columns2-3 (assuming rows are 0-based). So the rotated cluster is rows4 and3 reversed. \n\nWait, the test input's cluster is:\n\nRow3:3,1\n\nRow4:2,5\n\nSo rotating 180 degrees would reverse the order of rows and reverse each row:\n\nRow4:2,5 \u2192 reversed to 5,2\n\nRow3:3,1 \u2192 reversed to1,3\n\nSo the rotated cluster is:\n\n5 2\n\n1 3\n\nSo the four elements are 5,2,1,3. Thus:\n\nTop-left:5, top-right:2, bottom-left:1, bottom-right:3.\n\nEach as 2x2 blocks in the corners.\n\nSo the output would be:\n\n[5,5,0,0,2,2]\n\n[5,5,0,0,2,2]\n\n[0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\n[0,0,3,1,0,0]\n\n[0,0,2,5,0,0]\n\n[1,1,0,0,3,3]\n\n[1,1,0,0,3,3]\n\nBut the original middle rows (rows3-4) have 3,1 and2,5. They remain unchanged in the output. So the output should have those rows as-is, and the corners filled with the rotated numbers. So the output would look like:\n\n[5,5,0,0,2,2]\n\n[5,5,0,0,2,2]\n\n[0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\n[0,0,3,1,0,0]\n\n[0,0,2,5,0,0]\n\n[1,1,0,0,3,3]\n\n[1,1,0,0,3,3]\n\nWait, but the test input is a 6x6 grid. So the output must also be 6x6. Let me adjust:\n\nRow0: [5,5,0,0,2,2]\n\nRow1: [5,5,0,0,2,2]\n\nRow2: [0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow3: [0,0,3,1,0,0]\n\nRow4: [0,0,2,5,0,0]\n\nRow5: [1,1,0,0,3,3]\n\nBut this is only 6 rows. However, rows5 and 4 need to have the bottom-left and bottom-right. So row4 and5:\n\nRow4 would be [1,1,0,0,3,3]\n\nRow5 would be [1,1,0,0,3,3]\n\nWait, no. The bottom-left is rows4-5, columns0-1. So rows4 and5, first two columns filled with 1s. The bottom-right is rows4-5, columns4-5 filled with3s.\n\nSo rows4 and5 would be:\n\nRow4: [1,1,0,0,3,3]\n\nRow5: [1,1,0,0,3,3]\n\nBut in the test input's original row4 is [0,0,2,5,0,0]. So in the output, that row4 should remain as [0,0,2,5,0,0], but according to the pattern, we have to fill the bottom-left and bottom-right. So this is conflicting. Because in the training examples, the middle rows (where the original numbers are) remain unchanged, and the corners are added around them.\n\nLooking back at example0's input and output:\n\nInput middle rows:\n\n[0,0,9,3,0,0]\n\n[0,0,7,8,0,0]\n\nOutput middle rows:\n\nSame as input.\n\nSimilarly in example2, the middle rows remain the same. So the pattern is that the original cluster remains unchanged, and the corners are filled with the rotated values.\n\nSo in the test case, the original rows3 and4 are:\n\nRow3: [0,0,3,1,0,0]\n\nRow4: [0,0,2,5,0,0]\n\nThese should remain as they are. The corners are filled with the rotated cluster's elements. So the output's rows0-1 are top-left and top-right with 5s and2s. Rows4-5 are bottom-left and bottom-right with1s and3s.\n\nSo the output would be:\n\nRow0: [5,5,0,0,2,2]\n\nRow1: [5,5,0,0,2,2]\n\nRow2: [0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow3: [0,0,3,1,0,0]\n\nRow4: [0,0,2,5,0,0]\n\nRow5: [1,1,0,0,3,3]\n\nWait, but row5's columns0-1 are 1,1 and columns4-5 are3,3. So row5 is [1,1,0,0,3,3].\n\nBut row4 in the output should remain as the input's row4: [0,0,2,5,0,0]. So row4 isn't modified. The bottom-left is rows4-5, columns0-1, which in the output would be:\n\nRow4: [1,1, ... ] \u2192 but row4 must remain [0,0,2,5,0,0]. This is a contradiction. Wait, this suggests that my earlier understanding is incorrect.\n\nWait, looking at the training examples:\n\nIn example0, the original rows2-3 are kept, and the corners are added in rows0-1 and4-5.\n\nSimilarly, in example1, the original rows1-2 are kept, and corners added in rows0,3-4, and5.\n\nSo the pattern is that the original cluster is left as is, and the rotated numbers are placed in the corners (top two rows and bottom two rows). So for the test input:\n\nThe original cluster is in rows3-4, columns2-3. So rotated cluster is:\n\n5 2\n\n1 3\n\nSo the top two rows (0-1) get the first two elements as blocks (5 and2), and the bottom two rows (4-5) get the last two elements (1 and3). But row4 in the input is part of the original cluster, so it's kept. But how to fit the bottom-left and bottom-right into rows4-5.\n\nAh, perhaps the bottom two rows (4-5) are used for the third and fourth elements, but only in their respective corners. So:\n\nTop-left corner (rows0-1, columns0-1) filled with5.\n\nTop-right corner (rows0-1, columns4-5) filled with2.\n\nBottom-left corner (rows4-5, columns0-1) filled with1.\n\nBottom-right corner (rows4-5, columns4-5) filled with3.\n\nSo rows4-5 in the output would be:\n\nRow4: [1,1,0,0,3,3]\n\nRow5: [1,1,0,0,3,3]\n\nBut wait, the original row4 in the input is [0,0,2,5,0,0]. So how does this fit? Because in the training examples, the original rows are preserved. For example, example0's input rows2-3 are present in the output. Similarly, in example1's output, the original rows1-2 are present.\n\nSo in the test case's output, the original rows3-4 (third and fourth rows) should be preserved. So rows3 and4 are:\n\nRow3: [0,0,3,1,0,0]\n\nRow4: [0,0,2,5,0,0]\n\nThen, the bottom-left and bottom-right corners are in rows4-5. But row4 is part of the original cluster. So this is conflicting. Perhaps the bottom-left and bottom-right are in rows5-6, but since it's a 6x6 grid, rows5 is the last row.\n\nWait, the grid is 6 rows (0-5). So bottom-left would be rows4-5, columns0-1. But row4 is part of the original cluster. So how to handle this?\n\nLooking back at example0: the cluster is in rows2-3. The bottom-left and bottom-right are in rows4-5, which are outside the original cluster. Similarly, in example2, the cluster is rows2-3, and the bottom corners are in rows4-5.\n\nIn the test input, the cluster is in rows3-4. So the bottom corners would be in rows5-6, but since there are only six rows, row5 is the last. So the bottom-left and right would be rows5 and maybe row4. But row4 is part of the cluster, which is kept as is.\n\nThis seems like a problem. So perhaps the pattern is that regardless of where the cluster is, the corners are filled in the outermost rows. For example, if the cluster is in the middle (rows2-3), then the corners are in rows0-1 and4-5. If the cluster is lower (rows3-4), then the corners are in rows0-1 (top) and rows5 (bottom). But that would require adjusting. But in example1, the cluster is in rows1-2, and the bottom corners are in rows4-5 (example1's output has rows4-5 with 6s and4s). So perhaps the corners are always placed in rows0-1 (top) and rows4-5 (bottom), regardless of the cluster's position.\n\nSo for the test input:\n\nRotated cluster is 5,2,1,3.\n\nTop-left (rows0-1, columns0-1) filled with5s.\n\nTop-right (rows0-1, columns4-5) filled with2s.\n\nBottom-left (rows4-5, columns0-1) filled with1s.\n\nBottom-right (rows4-5, columns4-5) filled with3s.\n\nBut rows4-5 in the input are:\n\nRow4: [0,0,2,5,0,0]\n\nRow5: [0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nSo in the output, row4 would be [1,1,2,5,3,3], but this would overwrite the original row4's data, which is not allowed because in the training examples, the original cluster's rows are preserved. Therefore, this approach is incorrect.\n\nI must have made a mistake in understanding the pattern. Let me look back at example1's input and output again.\n\nExample1's input has the cluster in rows1-2. The output's bottom-left corners are in rows3-4 (rows3-4, columns0-1) filled with6s. So the bottom corners are placed just below the original cluster. Similarly, the top corners are placed above. So maybe the corners are placed in the rows adjacent to the cluster.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the corners are determined based on the position of the original cluster. For example, if the cluster is in rows1-2, then the top corners are in rows0-1, and the bottom corners are in rows3-4. But in example1's output, the bottom-left is in rows3-4, columns0-1 (6s), and the bottom-right in rows3-4, columns4-5 (4s). The original cluster is in rows1-2, so the bottom corners are placed in rows3-4. Then, the bottom rows (5) remain zeros.\n\nSo in the test input's case, the cluster is in rows3-4. So the top corners would be in rows0-1, and the bottom corners would be in rows5 (since there are no rows below 5). But rows5 is only one row, so perhaps it's filled with 1s and3s in columns0-1 and4-5.\n\nBut how to fit 2x2 blocks in a single row? That's not possible. Therefore, this approach is invalid.\n\nThis is getting too confusing. Maybe another angle: looking at the numbers in the output corners and their relation to the input cluster. For example, in example0, the top-left has8, which is the 7 from the input's fourth row. The top-right has7, which is the8 from the fourth row. The bottom-left has3, which is the3 from the third row, and bottom-right has9, which is the9 from the third row. So it's swapping the numbers from the two middle rows and placing them in the corners. For example, the numbers from the lower middle row (row3) are placed in the top corners, and the upper middle row (row2) in the bottom corners, but swapped.\n\nIn example0's input:\n\nRow2:9,3\n\nRow3:7,8\n\nOutput's top corners:7,8 become 8,7. Bottom corners:9,3 become3,9.\n\nSo perhaps for each pair in the middle rows, the numbers are reversed and placed in opposite corners.\n\nSimilarly, in example2's input:\n\nRow2:3,6\n\nRow3:5,2\n\nOutput's top corners:5,2 \u21922,5. Bottom corners:3,6 \u21926,3.\n\nSo the pattern is that the numbers from the lower middle row (row3) are reversed and placed in the top corners, and the numbers from the upper middle row (row2) are reversed and placed in the bottom corners.\n\nSo for row3's numbers a and b, they become b and a, placed in the top-right and top-left.\n\nFor row2's numbers c and d, they become d and c, placed in the bottom-right and bottom-left.\n\nIn example0:\n\nRow3:7,8 \u2192 reversed to8,7 \u2192 top-left and top-right.\n\nRow2:9,3 \u2192 reversed to3,9 \u2192 bottom-left and bottom-right.\n\nWhich matches the output.\n\nIn example2:\n\nRow3:5,2 \u2192 reversed to2,5 \u2192 top-right and top-left (wait, top-left is 2 in example2's output? Example2's output top-left is 2,2; top-right is5,5. So row3's numbers5,2 become2 and5, placed in top-right and top-left? Or maybe the lower middle row is row3 (original row3), and upper middle row is row2. So row3's numbers are placed as reversed in the top corners, and row2's numbers reversed in the bottom corners.\n\nExample2's input row2:3,6 \u2192 reversed to6,3 \u2192 placed in bottom corners:6,3. Output's bottom-left is6s and bottom-right is3s. So yes.\n\nSo the pattern is:\n\n- For the two middle rows (assuming the cluster is in the middle two rows), take the lower row (row3) and reverse its two elements, placing them in the top corners (left and right).\n\n- Take the upper row (row2) and reverse its elements, placing them in the bottom corners (left and right).\n\nBut how to determine which row is which?\n\nAlternatively, the cluster's rows are treated as rowA and rowB. Reversing rowA and rowB and placing them in the corners.\n\nBut how does this apply to example1?\n\nExample1's input cluster is in rows1 and2. So row1 and row2. The numbers are row1:4,6 and row2:2,1. Reversing row1:6,4. Reversing row2:1,2. Then:\n\nTop-left:1, top-right:2, bottom-left:6, bottom-right:4.\n\nLooking at example1's output:\n\nTop-left has1 in row0,0. Top-right has2s in row0 columns4-5. Bottom-left has6s in rows3-4, columns0-1. Bottom-right has4s in rows3-4 columns4-5. So this fits.\n\nSo the pattern is:\n\nIdentify the cluster's two rows (the two consecutive rows with non-zero numbers). Let's call them rowA and rowB (rowA is the upper row). Reverse the elements in rowB (lower row) and place them in the top corners (left and right). Reverse the elements in rowA and place them in the bottom corners (left and right).\n\nWait, in example1:\n\nRowB is row2:2,1 \u2192 reversed to1,2. Placed in top corners:1 (top-left),2 (top-right).\n\nRowA is row1:4,6 \u2192 reversed to6,4. Placed in bottom corners:6 (bottom-left),4 (bottom-right).\n\nBut in the output, the bottom corners are in rows3-4. So the pattern is:\n\n- Take the lower row (rowB) of the cluster, reverse the elements, and place them as 2x2 blocks in the top corners (left and right).\n\n- Take the upper row (rowA) of the cluster, reverse the elements, and place them as 2x2 blocks in the bottom corners (left and right).\n\nBut in example0, the cluster's rows are row2 and3. rowB is row3:7,8 \u2192 reversed to8,7 \u2192 top-left and top-right. rowA is row2:9,3 \u2192 reversed to3,9 \u2192 bottom-left and bottom-right.\n\nThis seems to fit.\n\nSo applying this to the test input:\n\nCluster is in row3 and4 (rows3 and4 are the two consecutive rows with non-zero numbers). rowB is row4:2,5 \u2192 reversed to5,2. These go to top-left and top-right. rowA is row3:3,1 \u2192 reversed to1,3. These go to bottom-left and bottom-right.\n\nSo top-left corners (rows0-1, columns0-1) filled with5s.\n\nTop-right corners (rows0-1, columns4-5) filled with2s.\n\nBottom-left corners (rows4-5, columns0-1) filled with1s.\n\nBottom-right corners (rows4-5, columns4-5) filled with3s.\n\nBut row4 in the input is part of the original cluster and remains unchanged. So how to handle that? The original row4 is [0,0,2,5,0,0]. But according to the pattern, the bottom-left corners are in rows4-5, which would overwrite row4's existing data. This suggests a problem.\n\nWait, in example1's output, the bottom-left corners are in rows3-4 (6s), and the original cluster was in rows1-2. So the original rows3-4 were zeros. So the bottom-left was placed in rows3-4. Similarly, in example0, the cluster is in rows2-3, and the bottom-left is in rows4-5.\n\nSo for the test input, the cluster is in rows3-4, so the bottom-left and right should be in rows5 and perhaps row4, but row4 is part of the original cluster. This is conflicting. Therefore, my earlier understanding must be incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the bottom corners are placed in the rows after the cluster. For example, if the cluster is in rows3-4, then the bottom corners are placed in rows5, but since there's only one row left, it's duplicated. But this doesn't fit the training examples.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the bottom corners are always placed in the two rows below the cluster. If the cluster is in rows3-4, then there's only row5 left. So perhaps only row5 is filled. But how to form 2x2 blocks in one row?\n\nThis is getting too time-consuming. Given the time constraints, I'll proceed with the initial pattern and apply it to the test input.\n\nTest input's cluster rows3-4: row3 has 3,1 and row4 has2,5.\n\nReversed row4:5,2 \u2192 top-left and top-right.\n\nReversed row3:1,3 \u2192 bottom-left and bottom-right.\n\nSo:\n\nTop-left:5s in rows0-1, columns0-1.\n\nTop-right:2s in rows0-1, columns4-5.\n\nBottom-left:1s in rows4-5, columns0-1.\n\nBottom-right:3s in rows4-5, columns4-5.\n\nBut row4 in the test input's output must remain [0,0,2,5,0,0], so the bottom-left (columns0-1) would be 0,0. But according to the pattern, they should be 1,1. This is a problem.\n\nBut according to the training examples, the original rows are preserved. So in the test case, row3 and4 must remain as is. Therefore, the bottom-left and right must be placed in rows5 and possibly row4. But row4's columns0-1 are 0,0. So maybe the bottom-left is in row5, columns0-1: [1,1].\n\nSimilarly, the bottom-right is row5 columns4-5: [3,3].\n\nSo the output would be:\n\nRow0: [5,5,0,0,2,2]\n\nRow1: [5,5,0,0,2,2]\n\nRow2: [0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow3: [0,0,3,1,0,0] (unchanged)\n\nRow4: [0,0,2,5,0,0] (unchanged)\n\nRow5: [1,1,0,0,3,3]\n\nThis matches the pattern of the training examples where the original rows are preserved, and the corners are filled around them. Example1's bottom-left is in rows3-4, but in the test case, it's rows5. So it depends on the cluster's position. If the cluster is in rows3-4, the bottom corners are in row5. But row5 is a single row, so the 2x2 block would be duplicated in row5.\n\nThis seems to fit. So the final answer would be:\n\n[5,5,0,0,2,2]\n\n[5,5,0,0,2,2]\n\n[0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\n[0,0,3,1,0,0]\n\n[0,0,2,5,0,0]\n\n[1,1,0,0,3,3]",

        "cot_2": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. So, looking at the training examples, each input is a 6x6 grid, and the output is a modified version of it. The goal is to understand what transformation is applied.\n\nStarting with Example 0. The input has a 9 and 3 in the third row, and a 7 and 8 in the fourth. The output has new numbers in the first two rows and the last two. The first two rows of the output are 8,8 and 7,7 on the edges. Then the last two rows have 3,3 and 9,9. Hmm. Maybe the new numbers are related to the original numbers in some way. Let's see: 9 and 3 are in the middle. The new numbers in the output's top are 8 and 7, and bottom are 3 and 9. Wait, maybe 9+3=12, and 7+8=15. Not sure. Alternatively, maybe the numbers around the center are mirrored or rotated?\n\nLooking at Example 1. The input has 4,6 in the second row and 2,1 in the third. The output has new numbers on the top and middle rows. The top row starts with 1,0,0,2,2,0. Then the fourth and fifth rows have 6,0,0,4,4,0. So maybe there's a reflection or swapping going on. The numbers 4 and 6 are in the input; in the output, the fourth row has 4 and 6 in the fourth and fifth positions. Wait, 4 and 6 are original, but the output's fourth row has 6 and 4. Hmm. Maybe the positions are mirrored. Also, in example 0, the original 7 and 8 in row 3 and 4. The output's bottom rows have 3 and 9. Wait, 3 and 9 are the numbers from the original third row (9,3). Maybe swapping them?\n\nWait, in example 0's output, the top has 8 and 7. The original third row has 9 and 3. The fourth row has 7 and 8. So maybe the numbers are swapped in some way. For example, 9 and 3 in the third row, and 7 and 8 in the fourth. The output's top rows have 8 and 7, which are from the fourth row. The bottom rows have 3 and 9, which are from the third row. Oh, maybe the numbers are being mirrored vertically. So the top part is taking the lower rows and flipping them, and the bottom part takes the upper rows.\n\nWait, in example 0's output, the first two rows have 8,8 and 7,7. The original fourth row (index 3 if 0-based) has 7 and 8. So 7 and 8 are in the fourth row. In the output's first two rows, the left side is 8 and 8, right side is 7 and 7. Wait, maybe they are taking the numbers from the fourth row, swapping their positions (7 and 8 become 8 and 7) and then duplicating them in the top rows. Similarly, the bottom rows in the output have 3 and 9, which are from the third row's 9 and 3, swapped and duplicated.\n\nSo maybe the pattern is that the non-zero numbers in the middle rows (rows 2 and 3) are mirrored, and then their values are used to create borders on the top and bottom.\n\nWait, let's check example 0's input. The non-zero rows are 2 and 3 (0-based index). So row 2 is [0,0,9,3,0,0], row 3 is [0,0,7,8,0,0]. The output's top two rows have 8 and 7 (from row3's 7,8 but swapped?), and bottom two rows have 3 and 9 (from row2's 9,3 swapped). So perhaps for each of the middle rows (rows 2 and 3), the non-zero numbers are swapped and placed in the top and bottom borders, with their positions mirrored.\n\nAlternatively, the output is creating a frame around the central 2x2 block. For example, in example 0, the central block is rows 2-3 and columns 2-3 (the 9,3 and 7,8). The output's top and bottom edges have numbers that are the same as the central block but rotated or swapped. Like the top left and right have the numbers from the bottom row of the central block (7 and 8) but reversed. The bottom part has the numbers from the top row of the central block (9 and 3) reversed. Then these are duplicated in blocks of 2x2 on the edges.\n\nSimilarly, in example 1, the central non-zero area is rows 1-2, columns 1-2 (4,6 and 2,1). The output's top row starts with 1, which is from the bottom of the central part (row2's 1), and 2,2 which might be from row1's 6? Or maybe the central numbers are being rotated and placed on the edges.\n\nAnother approach: perhaps the non-zero cells in the input form a 2x2 or 2x3 block, and the output mirrors this block to the top and bottom edges, possibly swapping numbers. Let me see:\n\nExample 0's output top has 8,8 on the left and 7,7 on the right. The original central part's fourth row (row3) is 7,8. So maybe those are split into left and right parts. 7 becomes the right part (since 7,8 in row3, so left is 7 and right is8?), but in the output's top, the left is 8 and right is7. So reversed.\n\nThen the bottom part of the output uses the third row's 9,3, reversed as 3,9. So perhaps the top border is made from the lower central row's numbers reversed, and the bottom border from the upper central row's numbers reversed.\n\nIn example 1, the central area is in rows1-2 and columns1-2:\n\nRow1: 4,6\n\nRow2:2,1\n\nThe output's top row has 1 and 2,2. So perhaps the 1 and 2 are from row2's 2,1 reversed (1,2). Then the bottom part in rows4-5 has 6 and 4, which are from row1's 4,6 reversed (6,4).\n\nSo the pattern could be:\n\n- Take the central non-zero 2x2 block (or perhaps the middle two rows with non-zero elements).\n\n- For the top part of the output, take the lower row of the central block, reverse the numbers, and place them in the top rows (left and right edges as 2x2 blocks).\n\n- For the bottom part of the output, take the upper row of the central block, reverse the numbers, and place them in the bottom rows (left and right edges as 2x2 blocks).\n\nIn example 0:\n\nCentral block lower row (row3):7,8 \u2192 reversed \u21928,7. So the top rows (0 and 1) have 8 on left and 7 on right as 2x2 blocks.\n\nCentral block upper row (row2):9,3 \u2192 reversed \u21923,9. So the bottom rows (4 and5) have 3 on left and9 on right as 2x2 blocks.\n\nIn example1:\n\nCentral block's lower row is row2 (2,1) \u2192 reversed \u21921,2. The top rows have 1 on the left and 2 on the right. But looking at example1's output, the top row starts with 1,0,0,2,2,0. So the left 2x2 block is [1,0] and [0,0], but maybe it's arranged differently. Wait, in example1's output, the first row is [1,0,0,2,2,0]. The second row is [0,4,6,0,0,0]. So the 1 is in the first column, and the 2's start at column4. But the 2's are two in a row. Hmm. Maybe the reversed numbers (1 and2) are placed as the left and right blocks. So the left block (columns0-1) would be 1 and the right (columns3-4) would be 2. But in the output, the first row has 1,0,0,2,2,0. So perhaps the left block (columns0-1) is [1,1], but in the output, it's 1 followed by 0. Hmm. Maybe I'm misunderstanding the placement.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the numbers are split into left and right, and each is duplicated into 2x2 blocks. For example, in example0, the 8 is placed on the left side (two columns) of the top two rows, and 7 on the right. So each is repeated as two columns. Similarly, in example1's output, the 1 is in the first column of row0, then 0s, then 2s in columns3-4. But perhaps the way the numbers are placed depends on the original positions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each of the two numbers from the reversed row is placed in the top left and top right corners as 2x2 squares, and similarly for the bottom.\n\nLooking at example2's input:\n\nCentral rows are 2 and3 (0-based) with 3,6 and5,2. The output's top has 2,2 on the left and5,5 on the right. The bottom has6,6 and3,3. So the top left is 2,2 and top right is5,5. The original central lower row (row3) is5,2. Reversed \u21922,5. So the top uses these as left and right. The upper row of the central block (row2:3,6) reversed \u21926,3 \u2192 placed on the bottom rows as left and right (6,6 and3,3). So that fits the pattern.\n\nSo the pattern seems to be:\n\n1. Identify the central 2 rows that have non-zero elements. These are the middle two rows (rows 2 and3 in 0-based indexing for 6x6 grid).\n\n2. For the upper part of these two (row2), reverse the two non-zero numbers and place them as 2x2 blocks in the bottom rows (rows4 and5) as left and right blocks.\n\n3. For the lower part of these two (row3), reverse the two non-zero numbers and place them as 2x2 blocks in the top rows (rows0 and1) as left and right blocks.\n\nBut wait, in example1, the central rows might be rows1 and2. Let's check:\n\nIn example1's input:\n\nRow1 (index1): [0,4,6,0,0,0]\n\nRow2 (index2): [0,2,1,0,0,0]\n\nSo the non-zero numbers are in rows1 and2. Then the upper part of these two is row1 (4,6) and lower part is row2 (2,1). Reversed row2 becomes 1,2. So the top rows should get 1 and2. The output's top row is [1,0,0,2,2,0]. So left block (columns0-1) is 1, and right block (columns3-4) is2,2. Then the bottom part should take the upper part (row1:4,6 reversed \u21926,4) and place them in the bottom rows. The output's rows4-5 (indices4 and5) have [6,0,0,4,4,0] and [6,0,0,4,4,0]. So left is6,6 and right is4,4. Which is 6 and4 reversed from row1's4,6.\n\nSo yes, the pattern seems to hold:\n\n- For the central two rows (which have the non-zero elements), split into upper and lower row.\n\n- The lower of the two (row3 in example0, row2 in example1) is reversed and placed in the top two rows as left and right 2x2 blocks.\n\n- The upper of the two (row2 in example0, row1 in example1) is reversed and placed in the bottom two rows as left and right 2x2 blocks.\n\nNow, applying this to the test input:\n\nTest Input:\n\n[0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\n[0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\n[0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\n[0,0,3,1,0,0]\n\n[0,0,2,5,0,0]\n\n[0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nSo the non-zero rows are rows3 and4 (indices3 and4). Row3: [0,0,3,1,0,0]\n\nRow4: [0,0,2,5,0,0]\n\nSo the upper of the two central rows is row3 (3,1), lower is row4 (2,5).\n\nReversed lower row (row4) is5,2. These are placed in the top two rows (rows0 and1) as left and right 2x2 blocks.\n\nSo left blocks (columns0-1) in rows0-1 would be5,5 and5,5. Right blocks (columns4-5) would be2,2 and2,2.\n\nWait, no. Wait, reversed lower row (2,5 \u2192 reversed becomes5,2). So left part is5, and right part is2. So the top rows (0 and1) will have left 5,5 and right 2,2.\n\nThen, upper row is row3 (3,1). Reversed \u21921,3. So the bottom rows (4 and5) would have left 1,1 and right3,3.\n\nWait, but wait, the original upper row (row3) is 3,1. Reversed is1,3. So bottom rows (4 and5) will have left blocks (columns0-1) as1,1 and right blocks (columns4-5) as3,3.\n\nBut in the test input, the rows3 and4 are:\n\nRow3: 3,1\n\nRow4:2,5\n\nSo upper of the two central rows is row3 (3,1), lower is row4 (2,5). \n\nReversed lower row (row4) \u21925,2. So top rows (0,1) will have left 5,5 (columns0-1) and right 2,2 (columns4-5). The middle part (columns2-3) in top rows will be 0s.\n\nReversed upper row (row3) \u21921,3. So bottom rows (4,5) will have left 1,1 (columns0-1) and right3,3 (columns4-5). The middle part (columns2-3) in bottom rows will be 0s.\n\nWait, but the test input's original row4 is [0,0,2,5,0,0]. So the lower row (row4) is 2,5. Reversed \u21925,2. So in the output's top rows (rows0 and1), the left edge (columns0-1) should be 5,5 (for two rows), and the right edge (columns4-5) should be 2,2. The middle of the top rows (columns2-3) are 0s.\n\nSimilarly, the upper row (row3) is 3,1. Reversed \u21921,3. So bottom rows (rows4 and5) should have left edge (columns0-1) as1,1 and right edge (columns4-5) as3,3. But wait, the original row4 is [0,0,2,5,0,0], and row5 is all zeros. So after processing, row4 and5 in the output will be:\n\nFor rows4 and5 (bottom rows):\n\ncolumns0-1: 1,1 in both rows.\n\ncolumns4-5:3,3 in both rows.\n\nThe middle parts (columns2-3) in rows4 and5 will be 0s, except for the existing numbers in rows3 and4. Wait, but in the test input's rows3 and4, the existing numbers are:\n\nRow3: 0,0,3,1,0,0 \u2192 non-zero at columns2-3 (3,1)\n\nRow4: 0,0,2,5,0,0 \u2192 non-zero at columns2-3 (2,5)\n\nIn the output, those numbers should remain the same in their original positions. So the output's rows2 and3 (original rows3 and4) would still have 3,1 and 2,5. Wait, but in the training examples, the middle rows (original non-zero) are preserved. For example, in example0, the third and fourth rows (original rows2 and3) are kept as-is. So the central part remains. So the output for the test input would have the original rows3 and4 (3,1 and2,5) unchanged. Then the top two rows (0 and1) get 5s on left and2s on right. The bottom two rows (4 and5) get 1s on left and3s on right. But row4 in the original input is [0,0,2,5,0,0], which is part of the central rows. So in the output, that row would now have the left edge 1,1 (columns0-1), then 2,5 in columns2-3, and right edge3,3 (columns4-5). Wait, no. Because according to the pattern, the original rows3 and4 are part of the central block and remain unchanged except for their own data. Wait, looking back at example0:\n\nInput rows2 and3 are:\n\n[0,0,9,3,0,0]\n\n[0,0,7,8,0,0]\n\nOutput rows2 and3 are same as input. So the central rows are preserved.\n\nIn example1, input rows1 and2:\n\nRow1: [0,4,6,0,0,0]\n\nRow2: [0,2,1,0,0,0]\n\nOutput rows1 and2 are same as input. So the central rows are not modified. So the new numbers are added to the top and bottom rows, leaving the central rows as-is.\n\nSo for the test input, the central rows (rows3 and4) would remain as they are. The top rows (0 and1) would have the left and right blocks from reversed lower central row (row4:2,5 \u2192 reversed5,2). The bottom rows (4 and5) would have the left and right blocks from reversed upper central row (row3:3,1 \u2192 reversed1,3). Wait, but original row4 is part of the central rows, so in the output, row4 and row3 are preserved. But according to the pattern, the bottom rows (original rows4 and5) are the ones where the upper central row's reversed numbers are placed. But original row4 is part of the central rows and should remain as-is. Hmm, this may be conflicting.\n\nWait, perhaps the central rows are those that are in the input's middle, like rows2 and3 (0-based) in example0 and example2, but in example1 it's rows1 and2. So the central rows are the two rows that have non-zero elements. So in the test input, the non-zero rows are 3 and4 (indices3 and4). So the lower central row is row4 (2,5), upper is row3 (3,1). Then, the top rows (0 and1) get the reversed lower central row (5,2) as left and right blocks. The bottom rows (4 and5) get the reversed upper central row (1,3) as left and right blocks.\n\nBut row4 in the input is part of the central rows, but in the output, it's part of the bottom rows where we place the reversed upper central row. So perhaps the original row4 is preserved, and the bottom rows (which are rows4 and5 in the output) are overwritten except for the central part.\n\nWait, looking at example1. The central rows are1 and2. The output's bottom rows are4 and5. Original rows4 and5 are all zeros. The output's rows4 and5 have the reversed upper central row (row1:4,6 \u2192 reversed6,4) placed as left and right blocks. The original central rows (rows1 and2) are preserved.\n\nIn the test input, the central rows are3 and4. So the bottom rows to be modified are4 and5. But original row4 is part of the central rows. So how is this handled?\n\nWait, in example0, the central rows are2 and3. The output's bottom rows4 and5 are modified with the reversed upper row (row2:9,3 \u21923,9). The original rows4 and5 are all zeros. So the pattern is that the central rows are preserved, and the top and bottom rows (outside the central rows) are filled with the reversed numbers.\n\nBut in the test input, the bottom rows to modify are4 and5. But row4 is part of the central rows and contains 2 and5. So how to handle that? Let's think:\n\nIn the test input:\n\nCentral rows:3 and4.\n\nTop rows to modify:0 and1 (using reversed lower central row4:2,5 \u21925,2. So top rows0-1: left 5,5, right 2,2.\n\nBottom rows to modify:4 and5 (using reversed upper central row3:3,1 \u21921,3. So in rows4 and5, columns0-1 are1,1 and columns4-5 are3,3. But row4 in the input is [0,0,2,5,0,0], which is part of the central rows. So in the output, row4's columns0-1 become1,1, columns2-3 remain 2,5, and columns4-5 become3,3. Then row5's columns0-1 are1,1 and columns4-5 are3,3, with the rest zeros.\n\nSo the output would look like:\n\nTop two rows:\n\n[5,5,0,0,2,2]\n\n[5,5,0,0,2,2]\n\nThen rows2 and3:\n\n[0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\n[0,0,3,1,0,0]\n\nRow4 (original row4):\n\n[1,1,2,5,3,3]\n\nRow5:\n\n[1,1,0,0,3,3]\n\nWait, but that's not matching the pattern. Because in the training examples, the central rows are preserved as they are, and the top and bottom rows are added with the new numbers. For example, in example0, the central rows (2 and3) are preserved, and the top and bottom rows are filled. Similarly in example1, the central rows (1 and2) are preserved. So in the test case, rows3 and4 (the central ones) should remain as they are. But the bottom rows to modify are4 and5. So row4 is part of the central rows and needs to remain, but according to the pattern, the bottom rows (4 and5) should have the reversed upper central row (3,1 \u21921,3). So how is this resolved?\n\nAh, maybe the pattern is that the central rows are rows2 and3 (regardless of input), but in the test input, the non-zero rows are3 and4, which is different. Wait, but looking back, in example1, the central rows were1 and2. So perhaps the central rows are the first two consecutive rows from the middle that have non-zero elements. Or maybe the central rows are the two middle rows of the grid (rows2 and3 in a 6x6 grid). But example1's central rows are1 and2, which are not the middle. So perhaps the central rows are determined by the position of non-zero elements.\n\nAlternatively, the pattern is that the central rows are the two middle rows (rows2 and3 in 0-based), and any non-zero numbers in those rows are used. For example, in example1, even though the non-zero rows are1 and2, the pattern still applies to rows2 and3. Wait, but example1's input rows2 and3 are:\n\nRow2: [0,2,1,0,0,0]\n\nRow3: [0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nSo row3 is all zeros. But according to the training example1's output, the top rows use the reversed row2 (2,1 \u21921,2), and the bottom rows use the reversed row1 (4,6 \u21926,4). Hmm, this complicates things.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the pattern is that the central rows are the two rows that have non-zero entries and are adjacent. So in example0, rows2 and3. In example1, rows1 and2. In example2, rows2 and3. Then in the test input, rows3 and4.\n\nIn that case, the pattern is:\n\nFor the two adjacent central rows (whatever their position):\n\n- The lower of the two is reversed and placed in the top two rows (rows0 and1) as left and right blocks.\n\n- The upper of the two is reversed and placed in the bottom two rows (rows4 and5) as left and right blocks.\n\nSo for the test input:\n\nCentral rows3 and4.\n\nLower row (row4):2,5 \u2192 reversed5,2 \u2192 top rows0-1: left 5,5 and right2,2.\n\nUpper row (row3):3,1 \u2192 reversed1,3 \u2192 bottom rows4-5: left1,1 and right3,3.\n\nBut row4 is part of the central rows and should remain as-is. So in the output, row4 (original row4) is [0,0,2,5,0,0]. But according to the pattern, the bottom rows (4 and5) are filled with 1,1 and3,3. So row4 would be modified to [1,1,2,5,3,3]? But that would change the central row's data, which in previous examples didn't happen. For instance, in example1, the central rows (1 and2) are preserved in the output. So this suggests that the central rows are left as-is, and the new blocks are added to the top and bottom rows that are outside the central rows.\n\nWait, in example1's input, the central rows are1 and2. The top rows0 and1 are filled with reversed row2 (2,1 \u21921,2). But row1 is part of the central rows. So in the output, row1 is preserved (as in example1's output, row1 is [0,4,6,0,0,0], which is the same as input). But the top row (row0) is filled with the reversed lower central row (row2:2,1 \u21921,2), and row1 is part of the central rows and remains. So the top rows are0 and1. Row0 is filled with the new numbers, row1 is preserved.\n\nSimilarly, the bottom rows4 and5 are filled with the reversed upper central row (row1:4,6 \u21926,4). So row4 and5, which were originally all zeros, are filled with 6,6 and4,4.\n\nSo in the test input, the central rows are3 and4. The top rows to modify are0 and1. The bottom rows are4 and5. But row4 is part of the central rows and should remain as-is. But according to the pattern, the bottom rows (4 and5) are filled with the reversed upper central row (row3:3,1 \u21921,3). But row4 in the output needs to retain its original data (2,5 in columns2-3). So how to merge these?\n\nAh, perhaps the pattern is that the new blocks are placed in the left and right edges of the top and bottom rows, leaving the central columns (columns2-3) untouched. For example, in example0's output:\n\nTop rows0 and1 have [8,8,0,0,7,7]. The central columns (columns2-3) are 0,0. The original central rows (2 and3) have 9,3 and7,8. The new blocks are added to the edges (columns0-1 and4-5).\n\nSimilarly, in example1's output, the top row0 is [1,0,0,2,2,0]. The central columns (2-3) are 0,0, while the original row1's data is preserved. So the new numbers are added to columns0-1 and4-5, leaving columns2-3 as they are (but in row0, columns2-3 are zeros).\n\nSo in the test input, the central rows3 and4 should remain as-is. The top rows0 and1 should have columns0-1 filled with5,5 (from reversed row4:5,2) and columns4-5 filled with2,2. The bottom rows4 and5 should have columns0-1 filled with1,1 (from reversed row3:1,3) and columns4-5 filled with3,3, but row4's columns2-3 are already filled with2,5. So row4 in the output would be [1,1,2,5,3,3], and row5 would be [1,1,0,0,3,3].\n\nSimilarly, row3 in the output remains [0,0,3,1,0,0].\n\nBut wait, the bottom rows to modify are4 and5. So row4 is part of the central rows and needs to retain columns2-3 (2,5). So in row4's output, columns0-1 are1,1, columns4-5 are3,3, and columns2-3 are2,5. Similarly, row5's columns0-1 are1,1, columns4-5 are3,3, and columns2-3 are0,0.\n\nSo the output would look like:\n\nRows0-1:\n\n[5,5,0,0,2,2]\n\n[5,5,0,0,2,2]\n\nRows2: all zeros.\n\nRow3: [0,0,3,1,0,0]\n\nRow4: [1,1,2,5,3,3]\n\nRow5: [1,1,0,0,3,3]\n\nBut wait, in example1, the bottom rows4 and5 are both filled with6,0,0,4,4,0. So each row in the bottom two rows is filled with the left and right blocks. So for the test input's row4 and5:\n\nRow4: columns0-1=1,1; columns4-5=3,3. The middle columns2-3 are original 2,5.\n\nRow5: columns0-1=1,1; columns4-5=3,3. Middle columns are 0s.\n\nSo the output would be:\n\n[5,5,0,0,2,2]\n\n[5,5,0,0,2,2]\n\n[0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\n[0,0,3,1,0,0]\n\n[1,1,2,5,3,3]\n\n[1,1,0,0,3,3]\n\nBut checking the training examples, for example0, the bottom rows4 and5 are:\n\n[3,3,0,0,9,9]\n\n[3,3,0,0,9,9]\n\nWhich have the reversed upper central row (3,9) as left and right blocks, with middle zeros.\n\nIn example1, the bottom rows4 and5 are:\n\n[6,0,0,4,4,0]\n\n[6,0,0,4,4,0]\n\nSo the left block is6,6 (columns0-1) and the right block is4,4 (columns3-4). But columns2-3 are zeros.\n\nSo applying this to the test input's row4 and5:\n\nRow4: columns0-1=1,1; columns4-5=3,3. Middle columns (2-3) are2,5 (from original row4).\n\nRow5: columns0-1=1,1; columns4-5=3,3. Middle columns (2-3) are0,0.\n\nBut in the training examples, the central rows' middle columns are preserved, and the new blocks are placed in the edges. So this should be correct.\n\nThus, the test input's output should be:\n\n[5,5,0,0,2,2]\n\n[5,5,0,0,2,2]\n\n[0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\n[0,0,3,1,0,0]\n\n[1,1,2,5,3,3]\n\n[1,1,0,0,3,3]\n\nBut I need to check if this matches the pattern. For example, the upper central row is row3 (3,1). Reversed \u21921,3. So bottom rows4-5 have left1,1 and right3,3. The original row4 has2,5 in columns2-3, which are preserved. So row4's columns0-1 and4-5 are filled with1s and3s, leaving the middle intact. Row5, which was all zeros, gets1s and3s in the edges. \n\nYes, this seems to fit. So the final answer should be as above."
