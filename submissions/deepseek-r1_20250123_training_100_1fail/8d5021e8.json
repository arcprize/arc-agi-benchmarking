        "cot_1": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. So, we have these training examples where each input is a 3x2 grid, and the output is a 9x4 grid. Hmm, the first thing I notice is that the output is much larger, so there's some kind of expansion happening. Let me look at the examples more closely.\n\nStarting with Example 0:\nInput is:\n[0, 8]\n[0, 0]\n[0, 8]\n\nOutput is a 9x4 grid. Let's see how the input elements are arranged in the output. The first row of the output is [8, 0, 0, 8]. Wait, that looks like the elements from the input's first row reversed and maybe mirrored. The original first input row is [0,8]. If we reverse that, it becomes [8,0], and then maybe mirror it to get [8,0,0,8]. That seems to fit the first output row. Then the second output row is all zeros, which corresponds to the second input row [0,0], but mirrored as well. So maybe each input row is transformed into three rows in the output, and each element is mirrored in some way.\n\nWait, looking at the output structure. Each input row becomes three rows in the output? Let me check the number of rows. The input has 3 rows, the output has 9. So 3x3. So each input row is expanded into three output rows. Then each of those rows is generated based on the input row's elements.\n\nLooking at Example 0's output, the first three rows of the output correspond to the first input row. Then the next three to the second input row, and the last three to the third input row. Each input row's elements are transformed into three output rows. Let's break it down.\n\nTake the first input row of Example 0: [0,8]. The output rows for this are:\n[8,0,0,8]\n[0,0,0,0]\n[8,0,0,8]\n\nSo the first and third rows of each trio are the same, and the middle is all zeros. How does [0,8] become [8,0,0,8]? Well, perhaps each element is mirrored. For the first element (0), maybe it becomes something, and the second element (8) becomes the bookends. Wait, maybe each element in the input row is expanded into two elements, and then mirrored. For example, the first element 0 might become 8 and 0, but that doesn't fit. Wait in the output, the first element is 8, which is the second element of the input row. Hmm, maybe the input row is reversed and then each element is duplicated. So [0,8] reversed is [8,0], then each element is duplicated, giving [8,8,0,0]? No, but the output is [8,0,0,8]. Oh, wait, maybe it's the original elements, but arranged in a mirrored pattern. Like for the input [a, b], the output row would be [b, a, a, b]? Wait, [0,8] would become [8,0,0,8]. Let's check:\n\nOriginal input row [a, b] = [0,8]. Then the output row is [b, a, a, b] which would be [8,0,0,8]. Yes, that matches. So each input row's elements are transformed into a 4-element row by taking [b, a, a, b]. Then, the middle row of the trio is all zeros if the original row's elements sum to something? Wait in Example 0's first input row [0,8], the middle row is all zeros. The second input row is [0,0], and the middle row is all zeros again. The third input row is [0,8], same as the first, so their middle rows are zeros. But in Example 1:\n\nInput row [2,0] \u2192 output first trio's rows are [0,2,2,0], then [2,2,2,2], then [0,2,2,0]. So here, the middle row is [2,2,2,2]. Wait, but the input row here is [2,0], sum is 2. The middle row is 2s. Hmm. So perhaps the middle row depends on the sum of the input row's elements? For Example 0's first row, sum is 8. The middle row is zeros. But in Example 1's first row, sum is 2, middle row is 2s. Example 2's first input row is [0,0], sum 0. The middle row in the output trio is [0,0,0,0]. Second input row is [0,5], sum 5. Middle row is [5,0,0,5]. Third input row is [5,0], sum 5. Middle row is [0,0,0,0]. Wait, this seems inconsistent. Let me check Example 2.\n\nIn Example 2, the input is:\n[0,0]\n[0,5]\n[5,0]\n\nThe output starts with [0,5,5,0] (from first input row [0,0]?), then [5,0,0,5], then zeros. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me re-examine Example 2's input and output.\n\nWait, the input rows are:\n\nRow 0: [0,0]\n\nRow 1: [0,5]\n\nRow 2: [5,0]\n\nThe output has 9 rows. Let's see the first three output rows:\n\n[0,5,5,0]\n\n[5,0,0,5]\n\n[0,0,0,0]\n\nHmm, but the first input row is [0,0], so how does that produce the first trio of output rows? That doesn't fit the previous pattern. Because the first output row here is [0,5,5,0], which suggests that the input row is [0,5], but that's the second input row. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me re-express the examples.\n\nWait, in Example 2, the first input row is [0,0], second [0,5], third [5,0]. The output starts with:\n\nRow 0: [0,5,5,0] \u2192 which corresponds to the second input row [0,5], perhaps? But that's the second row. Or maybe the pattern is not just per row but involves the entire grid. Hmm, maybe there's a different approach.\n\nLooking at the output grids for all examples, perhaps each input row is transformed into a 3x4 block. Since each input has 3 rows, the output is 3x3 blocks (3 rows in input, each becomes 3 rows in output) resulting in 9 rows. Each input row's two elements generate a 3-row section in the output. Let's think of each input row as a, b. How does a and b generate three rows of four elements each.\n\nLooking at Example 1:\n\nInput row is [2,0]. The trio in output is:\n\nRow0: [0,2,2,0]\n\nRow1: [2,2,2,2]\n\nRow2: [0,2,2,0]\n\nSo for a=2, b=0:\n\nRow0: [b, a, a, b] \u2192 [0,2,2,0]\n\nRow1: [a, a, a, a] \u2192 [2,2,2,2]\n\nRow2: [b, a, a, b]\n\nThen in Example 0, input row [0,8], so a=0, b=8:\n\nRow0: [8,0,0,8]\n\nRow1: [0,0,0,0]\n\nRow2: [8,0,0,8]\n\nSo the middle row is filled with a. Because a is 0, so all zeros. In Example 1, a is 2, middle row is all 2s. So the pattern seems to be:\n\nFor an input row [a, b], the output trio is:\n\nRow1: [b, a, a, b]\n\nRow2: [a, a, a, a]\n\nRow3: [b, a, a, b]\n\nWait, but in Example 0, the input row is [0,8], so a=0, b=8. Then the trio would be:\n\nRow1: 8,0,0,8\n\nRow2: 0,0,0,0\n\nRow3: 8,0,0,8\n\nWhich matches. For Example 1's input row [2,0], a=2, b=0. So:\n\nRow1: 0,2,2,0\n\nRow2: 2,2,2,2\n\nRow3: 0,2,2,0\n\nWhich matches. Then for Example 2's first input row [0,0], a=0, b=0. So trio would be:\n\nRow1: 0,0,0,0\n\nRow2: 0,0,0,0\n\nRow3: 0,0,0,0\n\nBut the actual output for Example 2's first trio is:\n\n[0,5,5,0]\n\n[5,0,0,5]\n\n[0,0,0,0]\n\nWait, this doesn't fit. So perhaps there's more to the pattern. Let's look again at Example 2's input and output.\n\nExample 2 Input:\n\nRow0: [0,0]\n\nRow1: [0,5]\n\nRow2: [5,0]\n\nOutput:\n\nRow0: [0,5,5,0] \u2192 first trio, maybe from input row1?\n\nRow1: [5,0,0,5]\n\nRow2: [0,0,0,0]\n\nThen the next trio (rows3-5) are:\n\n[0,0,0,0]\n\n[5,0,0,5]\n\n[0,5,5,0]\n\nAnd then rows6-8:\n\n[0,5,5,0]\n\n[5,0,0,5]\n\n[0,0,0,0]\n\nHmm, this is more complex. It seems like the output isn't just processing each input row in order. The output has 9 rows, but the input is 3 rows, so perhaps each input row is processed three times, but arranged in a different way. Alternatively, maybe the output is a 3x3 grid of 3x4 blocks, each block corresponding to a combination of input elements.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by mirroring the input grid and then expanding each element. Wait, perhaps the input is arranged in a 3x2 grid, and then mirrored horizontally to make a 3x4 grid. But the outputs are 9 rows, so that's not directly it.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is constructed by taking each element in the input and creating a 3x4 block based on some rules, then arranging them in a 3x3 grid of these blocks. Let's think.\n\nEach input element could generate a 3x4 block, but the output has 9 rows and 4 columns, so 3x3 blocks (each 3 rows high) would require 3 blocks vertically. Wait, 3 input rows, each generating 3 output rows. But how do the columns work? The input has 2 columns, and the output has 4 columns. So maybe each input element is transformed into a 3x2 block, then combined with the adjacent elements. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each input row is transformed into three output rows, and each output row is formed by combining the elements of the input row and adjacent rows. For example, the first trio of output rows might be based on the first and second input rows, the second trio on all three, etc. But I need to check.\n\nAlternatively, let's look for the Test Input and see if applying the pattern from the examples works.\n\nTest Input:\n\n[3,3]\n\n[3,0]\n\n[3,3]\n\nIf the pattern is that each input row [a, b] generates three output rows:\n\nRow1: [b, a, a, b]\n\nRow2: [a, a, a, a]\n\nRow3: [b, a, a, b]\n\nThen for the first input row [3,3], a=3, b=3:\n\nRow1: [3,3,3,3]\n\nRow2: [3,3,3,3]\n\nRow3: [3,3,3,3]\n\nBecause a and b are both 3. Then the second input row [3,0], a=3, b=0:\n\nRow1: [0,3,3,0]\n\nRow2: [3,3,3,3]\n\nRow3: [0,3,3,0]\n\nThird input row [3,3], same as first, so trio is all 3s.\n\nSo the output would be:\n\n[3,3,3,3]\n\n[3,3,3,3]\n\n[3,3,3,3]\n\n[0,3,3,0]\n\n[3,3,3,3]\n\n[0,3,3,0]\n\n[3,3,3,3]\n\n[3,3,3,3]\n\n[3,3,3,3]\n\nBut looking at the training examples, like Example 1, the input rows are [2,0], [2,2], [2,0]. The output trios for each row are:\n\nRow0-2: [0,2,2,0], [2,2,2,2], [0,2,2,0]\n\nRow3-5: same as first trio (since input row is [2,2], a=2, b=2. So trio would be [2,2,2,2], [2,2,2,2], [2,2,2,2]. But in the example, the output rows 3-5 are [0,2,2,0], [2,2,2,2], [0,2,2,0]. Wait, that's the same as the first trio. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the pattern here. Wait in Example 1, the input is:\n\n[2,0]\n\n[2,2]\n\n[2,0]\n\nThe output's first trio is for the first input row [2,0], which gives:\n\n[0,2,2,0]\n\n[2,2,2,2]\n\n[0,2,2,0]\n\nThen the second trio is for the input row [2,2], so a=2, b=2. Then the trio would be:\n\nRow: [2,2,2,2]\n\nMiddle row: [2,2,2,2]\n\nSo the three rows would be all 2s. But in the actual output, the second trio (rows 3-5) are:\n\n[0,2,2,0]\n\n[2,2,2,2]\n\n[0,2,2,0]\n\nWhich is the same as the first trio. That's conflicting with my earlier idea. So maybe the pattern isn't as straightforward as applying each input row's trio in order. Because the middle input row in Example 1 is [2,2], but the output trio is the same as the first and third trios.\n\nWait, perhaps there's a different approach. Let's look at the output grids and see how the numbers are arranged. For Example 0, the output has 8s in a pattern that forms a diamond or something. Maybe the output is created by mirroring the input in some way and then expanding each element into a 3x3 block. But the input is 3x2, which when mirrored becomes 3x4. Then each element is expanded into a 3x3 block? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is constructed by taking each element from the input and placing it in a certain pattern. For example, in Example 0, the input has 0 and 8. The output has 8s arranged in a cross shape. Similarly, Example 1's output has 2s in a cross. Example 2's output has 5s forming a different pattern. So perhaps the output is a larger grid where each element is placed in a specific position based on the input grid.\n\nBut I'm not seeing the exact pattern. Let's try to think of each input row being transformed into a 3x4 block. For example, each input row becomes three rows of four elements. The way it's done in Example 1:\n\nInput row [2,0] becomes:\n\n[0,2,2,0]\n\n[2,2,2,2]\n\n[0,2,2,0]\n\nSo each input element is part of the output. The middle row is filled with the first element of the input row? No, because in this case, the first element is 2, and the middle row is all 2s. In Example 0, the input row [0,8], the middle row is all 0s. So yes, the middle row is filled with the first element of the input row, and the other rows are built using the second element. Wait, perhaps:\n\nFor each input row [a, b], the output trio is:\n\nRow1: [b, a, a, b]\n\nRow2: [a, a, a, a]\n\nRow3: [b, a, a, b]\n\nThis seems consistent with the first two examples. Let's check Example 2. The input rows are:\n\nRow0: [0,0]\n\nRow1: [0,5]\n\nRow2: [5,0]\n\nSo applying the rule:\n\nRow0: [0,0] \u2192 trio rows would be:\n\nRow0: [0,0,0,0]\n\nRow1: [0,0,0,0]\n\nRow2: [0,0,0,0]\n\nBut in Example 2's output, the first trio is:\n\n[0,5,5,0]\n\n[5,0,0,5]\n\n[0,0,0,0]\n\nHmm, this doesn't match. So perhaps there's a different approach. Maybe the output is generated by considering the entire input grid and transforming it into a larger grid by some mirroring or tiling.\n\nAnother idea: the input is a 3x2 matrix. The output is a 9x4 matrix. Let's see if 9 rows are 3 times 3 rows (each input row generates 3 output rows) and 4 columns are 2 times 2 (each input column generates 2 output columns). So each input element is transformed into a 3x2 block. Then arranging those blocks into the output.\n\nBut how?\n\nAlternatively, each input element is replicated into a 3x2 block. But the output columns are 4, which is 2 times 2, so maybe mirrored.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the first example's output:\n\nEach of the input rows [0,8], [0,0], [0,8] generate trios of rows. Let's think of the output as three vertical sections (since the input has two columns, perhaps each column becomes two columns in the output). For example, the input's first column is [0,0,0], and the second column is [8,0,8]. Then the output's columns are generated by combining these columns.\n\nBut not sure.\n\nLooking at the first output example:\n\n[8,0,0,8]\n\n[0,0,0,0]\n\n[8,0,0,8]\n\nThen repeats. So maybe the output is a tiling of the input's elements in a certain pattern. Like each element is placed in a cross shape. For example, the 8s in Example 0 are arranged in a cross. Let's see:\n\nThe output for Example 0 has 8s in positions (0,0), (0,3), (2,0), (2,3), etc. So perhaps each 8 from the input is placed in the corners of a 3x4 block. But this is getting complicated.\n\nAlternatively, think of the output as a 3x3 grid of 3x4 blocks. Wait, no. The output has 9 rows and 4 columns. So it's 9x4. Hmm. Maybe each input row is processed to generate three rows, and each row is formed by combining the elements from the input row and the next row, or something like that.\n\nWait, in Example 2's input:\n\nRow0: [0,0]\n\nRow1: [0,5]\n\nRow2: [5,0]\n\nThe output starts with:\n\n[0,5,5,0]\n\n[5,0,0,5]\n\n[0,0,0,0]\n\nThen:\n\n[0,0,0,0]\n\n[5,0,0,5]\n\n[0,5,5,0]\n\nThen:\n\n[0,5,5,0]\n\n[5,0,0,5]\n\n[0,0,0,0]\n\nSo this looks like a reflection. The first trio is perhaps the input's row1, then row0, then row2. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the output is generated by taking the input, flipping it vertically and horizontally, and interleaving the elements. For example, the first row of the output might be a combination of the first and third input rows. But this is unclear.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each trio in the output corresponds to a diagonal or some other arrangement of the input elements. Let's think of the output as being constructed from the input elements arranged in a particular way, maybe using symmetry.\n\nAnother approach: Let's look at the sum of the elements in the input and the output.\n\nExample 0:\n\nInput sums: 8, 0, 8 \u2192 total 16.\n\nOutput sums: Each row of the output has 8+0+0+8=16 for the first and third rows of each trio. Middle rows are 0. There are 3 trios. Each trio has two rows with sum 16 and one with 0. So total sum would be 3 trios \u00d7 (2\u00d716 + 0) = 96. But 16 input sum vs 96 output: 6 times. Not sure if that's relevant.\n\nExample 1:\n\nInput sum per row: 2,4,2 \u2192 total 8.\n\nOutput sum per row: first and third rows of each trio sum to 0+2+2+0=4. Middle row sums to 8. Each trio contributes 4+8+4=16. There are 3 trios \u2192 3\u00d716=48. Input sum 8 \u2192 48 is 6 times. So same ratio.\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput sum per row: 0,5,5 \u2192 total 10.\n\nOutput sum per row varies. Let's calculate:\n\nRow0: 0+5+5+0=10.\n\nRow1:5+0+0+5=10.\n\nRow2:0.\n\nRow3:0.\n\nRow4:10.\n\nRow5:0.\n\nRow6:10.\n\nRow7:10.\n\nRow8:0.\n\nTotal sum: 10+10+0 +0+10+0 +10+10+0 = 50. Which is 5 times the input sum of 10. Hmm, inconsistent with previous examples.\n\nSo maybe sum is not the key. Back to structure.\n\nAlternative idea: Each element in the input is transformed into a 3x3 block, and then these blocks are arranged in a way to form the output. For example, input is 3x2 \u2192 each element becomes 3x3 \u2192 output is 3*3=9 rows, and 2*3=6 columns. But the output has 4 columns, so this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, each input row is expanded vertically into three rows, and each column is expanded into two columns. So input row [a,b] becomes three rows of [b,a,a,b], but how columns are handled.\n\nWait, each input row has two elements, which become four elements in the output row. For example, [a,b] becomes [b,a,a,b]. So that's doubling each element and mirroring. Then, each input row is replicated three times, but with different middle rows. For example, for each input row:\n\nThe first and third rows of the trio are [b,a,a,b], and the middle row is filled with a's value if it's the first element? Or the sum of a and b.\n\nWait, in Example 0's first trio:\n\nInput row [0,8] \u2192 a=0, b=8.\n\nOutput rows:\n\n[8,0,0,8]\n\n[0,0,0,0]\n\n[8,0,0,8]\n\nThe middle row is all a's (0), and the first and third rows are [b, a, a, b].\n\nIn Example 1's first trio:\n\nInput row [2,0] \u2192 a=2, b=0.\n\nMiddle row is all a's (2), and the first and third rows are [0,2,2,0].\n\nIn Example 2's first trio, the input row is [0,0], so a=0, b=0. Middle row should be all 0's. But according to the output, the first trio is:\n\n[0,5,5,0]\n\n[5,0,0,5]\n\n[0,0,0,0]\n\nWait, this is inconsistent. The input row here is [0,0], but the output rows have 5s. That suggests that the pattern isn't derived solely from the current input row but involves other rows. So perhaps the pattern is based on the entire input grid, not just individual rows.\n\nLooking back at Example 2's input:\n\nRow0: [0,0]\n\nRow1: [0,5]\n\nRow2: [5,0]\n\nThe output's first trio starts with [0,5,5,0], which is [b, a, a, b] where a=5 and b=0. But the first input row is [0,0], so this doesn't fit. So this suggests that the pattern involves combining elements from different rows. Perhaps each trio in the output is based on a combination of the current input row and the next row, or some other arrangement.\n\nAlternatively, the output is generated by taking each element in the input grid and creating a 3x4 block based on its value and position. For example, the element at (i,j) in the input contributes to certain positions in the output. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the input matrix mirrored and expanded with some symmetry. For example, each row is mirrored and replicated three times with some transformation.\n\nAnother approach: Let's look for a pattern in how the output rows are ordered. For Example 0, the output has three trios, each trio being:\n\n[8,0,0,8]\n\n[0,0,0,0]\n\n[8,0,0,8]\n\nThen repeated three times. So the same trio repeated three times. But in Example 1, the output trios are the same as well. Each trio is:\n\n[0,2,2,0]\n\n[2,2,2,2]\n\n[0,2,2,0]\n\nAnd this is repeated three times. So the output is three copies of the same trio. But in Example 2, the output trios vary. The first trio is:\n\n[0,5,5,0]\n\n[5,0,0,5]\n\n[0,0,0,0]\n\nThe second trio is:\n\n[0,0,0,0]\n\n[5,0,0,5]\n\n[0,5,5,0]\n\nThe third trio is:\n\n[0,5,5,0]\n\n[5,0,0,5]\n\n[0,0,0,0]\n\nSo it's a pattern that cycles through different trios. So perhaps the output is generated by combining the input rows in a certain order and transforming each combination.\n\nAlternatively, think of the input as a 3x2 grid, and the output is a 3x3 grid of 3x4 blocks. Wait, but the output has 9 rows and 4 columns, which would require each block to be 3 rows tall and 4 columns wide, but arranged in a 3x3 grid of blocks. But that's not possible. Alternatively, each input cell generates a 3x4 block, arranged in a way that rows and columns are merged.\n\nAlternatively, the output is a combination of the input grid and its transpose, mirrored versions, etc.\n\nThis is getting too complicated. Let's try to find a pattern that works for all examples and then apply it to the test case.\n\nLet me try to see for the Test Input:\n\nTest Input:\n\n[3,3]\n\n[3,0]\n\n[3,3]\n\nIf the pattern is that each input row [a, b] generates a trio of rows: [b, a, a, b], [a, a, a, a], [b, a, a, b], then the output would be:\n\nFirst input row [3,3]:\n\n[3,3,3,3]\n\n[3,3,3,3]\n\n[3,3,3,3]\n\nSecond input row [3,0]:\n\n[0,3,3,0]\n\n[3,3,3,3]\n\n[0,3,3,0]\n\nThird input row [3,3]:\n\nSame as first trio.\n\nSo the output would be:\n\n[3,3,3,3]\n\n[3,3,3,3]\n\n[3,3,3,3]\n\n[0,3,3,0]\n\n[3,3,3,3]\n\n[0,3,3,0]\n\n[3,3,3,3]\n\n[3,3,3,3]\n\n[3,3,3,3]\n\nBut looking at the training examples, especially Example 2, this doesn't fit. Because Example 2's input includes rows that are [0,5] and [5,0], which in the output create varying trios. So perhaps the pattern is different.\n\nWait, perhaps the output is a combination of the original input grid and its mirror image. For example, if the input is a 3x2 matrix, then mirroring it to make a 3x4 matrix (mirroring each row), and then each element is expanded into a 3x3 block. But how.\n\nAlternatively, the output is created by taking each row of the input and creating a 3x4 block by mirroring the row and then applying some transformations. For instance:\n\nOriginal row [a, b] \u2192 mirrored becomes [a, b, b, a]. Then each element in this mirrored row is expanded into a 3-row pattern. For example, each element x becomes:\n\nRow1: x, x, x, x\n\nRow2: x, x, x, x\n\nRow3: x, x, x, x\n\nBut that would create 3 rows per input row. But in Example 0, the input row [0,8] mirrored is [0,8,8,0], then each element becomes three rows. But the output for Example 0's first trio is [8,0,0,8], which is the reverse of [0,8] mirrored. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, each row is reversed and mirrored. For example, [a, b] \u2192 reversed is [b, a], then mirrored to make [b, a, a, b]. Then each of these elements is expanded into three rows. But how.\n\nWait, the first row of the trio in Example 0 is [8,0,0,8], which is [b, a, a, b] where [a, b] is the input row [0,8]. So the first and third rows of the trio are [b, a, a, b], and the middle row is [a, a, a, a]. So applying that to the test input:\n\nTest input rows:\n\nRow0: [3,3] \u2192 [3,3,3,3] for first and third rows, and [3,3,3,3] for middle.\n\nRow1: [3,0] \u2192 [0,3,3,0], [3,3,3,3], [0,3,3,0].\n\nRow2: [3,3] \u2192 same as row0.\n\nSo the output would be three trios:\n\nRow0-2: [3,3,3,3], [3,3,3,3], [3,3,3,3]\n\nRow3-5: [0,3,3,0], [3,3,3,3], [0,3,3,0]\n\nRow6-8: [3,3,3,3], [3,3,3,3], [3,3,3,3]\n\nWhich matches the structure of Example 1, where the first and third trios are the same and the middle trio is different. But when we look at Example 2, this pattern doesn't hold because the input rows are different.\n\nBut in Example 2, the input rows are [0,0], [0,5], [5,0]. Applying the same pattern:\n\nRow0: [0,0] \u2192 [0,0,0,0], [0,0,0,0], [0,0,0,0]\n\nRow1: [0,5] \u2192 [5,0,0,5], [0,0,0,0], [5,0,0,5]\n\nRow2: [5,0] \u2192 [0,5,5,0], [5,5,5,5], [0,5,5,0]\n\nBut Example 2's output is different. So this suggests that the pattern I'm considering isn't correct.\n\nAlternative approach: Let's look at the positions in the output and see how they relate to the input.\n\nIn Example 0, the output's first trio is:\n\n[8,0,0,8]\n\n[0,0,0,0]\n\n[8,0,0,8]\n\nThe input's first row is [0,8]. The output's first and third rows of the trio have 8s at the ends and 0s in the middle. The middle row is all 0s. So perhaps each element in the input row is placed at the corners of a 3x4 block, with the first element in the middle row, and the second element at the edges.\n\nAlternatively, the first element of the input row becomes the middle row's value, and the second element becomes the first and third rows' corners.\n\nWait, for input [a, b], the output trio's first and third rows are [b, a, a, b], and the middle row is [a, a, a, a]. This fits Examples 0 and 1.\n\nBut Example 2's first trio is:\n\n[0,5,5,0] \u2192 b=5, a=0 from input row [0,5]\n\n[5,0,0,5] \u2192 a=5, b=0? But the input row is [0,5], so this doesn't fit. So perhaps there's a different rule here.\n\nWait, maybe the middle row's elements are the sum of a and b. For Example 0's first row [0,8], sum is 8. Middle row is 0s. No, that doesn't fit. \n\nAlternatively, the middle row is a combination of the current row and the next row. For Example 2's first trio, the input rows are row0: [0,0], row1: [0,5], row2: [5,0]. The output's first trio might be based on row1. Because the first trio's middle row is [5,0,0,5], which could be [5,0,0,5] \u2192 which is [5,0] followed by [0,5] reversed. So maybe it's using elements from the next row.\n\nThis is getting too speculative. Let's try to find a pattern that works for all examples.\n\nIn Example 2:\n\nInput rows:\n\nRow0: [0,0]\n\nRow1: [0,5]\n\nRow2: [5,0]\n\nOutput's first three rows:\n\n[0,5,5,0] \u2192 which is [0,5,5,0], which could be the input's row1 and row2 elements. Or [0,5] and [5,0] combined.\n\nThe second row of the trio is [5,0,0,5], which is [5,0,0,5], which could be row2's elements [5,0] reversed and mirrored.\n\nThe third row is [0,0,0,0], which could be row0's elements [0,0].\n\nSo perhaps the output is generated by combining elements from different rows in a certain way. For example, each trio in the output corresponds to a diagonal or some combination of the input rows.\n\nAlternatively, the output is a 3x3 grid where each block is formed by combining two input rows. For example, the first trio corresponds to row0 and row1, the second to row1 and row2, and the third to row2 and row0.\n\nBut I'm not sure. Given the time I've spent and not finding a clear pattern, maybe I should proceed with the initial hypothesis that each input row [a,b] generates a trio of rows: [b,a,a,b], [a,a,a,a], [b,a,a,b]. Then apply that to the test input.\n\nTest Input:\n\nRow0: [3,3] \u2192 [3,3,3,3] three times.\n\nRow1: [3,0] \u2192 [0,3,3,0], [3,3,3,3], [0,3,3,0].\n\nRow2: [3,3] \u2192 same as row0.\n\nSo the output would be:\n\nRow0: [3,3,3,3]\n\nRow1: [3,3,3,3]\n\nRow2: [3,3,3,3]\n\nRow3: [0,3,3,0]\n\nRow4: [3,3,3,3]\n\nRow5: [0,3,3,0]\n\nRow6: [3,3,3,3]\n\nRow7: [3,3,3,3]\n\nRow8: [3,3,3,3]\n\nBut looking at Example 1, which has input [2,0], [2,2], [2,0], the output has the same trio repeated three times. So this pattern would generate the same for the test input's first and third rows. But the test input's middle row would generate a different trio. However, this doesn't match the structure of Example 2, but maybe Example 2 is an exception due to different input values. Perhaps the correct pattern is that each input row's trio is generated as [b,a,a,b], [a,a,a,a], [b,a,a,b], and the output is the concatenation of these trios for each input row in order.\n\nApplying this to the Test Input:\n\nThe three input rows are [3,3], [3,0], [3,3].\n\nFor each:\n\nRow0: [3,3] \u2192 [3,3,3,3] three times.\n\nRow1: [3,0] \u2192 [0,3,3,0], [3,3,3,3], [0,3,3,0].\n\nRow2: [3,3] \u2192 same as row0.\n\nSo the output would be:\n\n[3,3,3,3]\n\n[3,3,3,3]\n\n[3,3,3,3]\n\n[0,3,3,0]\n\n[3,3,3,3]\n\n[0,3,3,0]\n\n[3,3,3,3]\n\n[3,3,3,3]\n\n[3,3,3,3]\n\nWhich matches the structure of Example 1, where the middle input row's trio is different. So perhaps this is the correct pattern, even though Example 2 seems to contradict it. But since Example 2's input has different elements, maybe there's an exception when a=0 and b=5, but I'm not sure. Given the time constraints, I'll proceed with this pattern.",

        "cot_2": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. So, we have these input matrices and their corresponding output matrices. My job is to find out how each input is transformed into the output so that I can apply the same logic to the test input.\n\nLooking at Example 0 first. The input is a 3x2 matrix:\n\n[0, 8]\n[0, 0]\n[0, 8]\n\nAnd the output is a 9x4 matrix. Let's see how the input might be expanded. The output has 9 rows, which is three times the original 3 rows. Similarly, the columns go from 2 to 4, which is double. So maybe each element in the input is being transformed into a 3x2 block in the output? Wait, but 3 rows becoming 9 rows would mean each row is tripled. Similarly, 2 columns becoming 4 would be doubled. So each cell in the input is mapped to a 3x2 block in the output.\n\nBut how exactly? Let's check the numbers. In Example 0's input, the first row is [0,8]. The output starts with [8,0,0,8]. Hmm. Wait, the output rows are arranged in a way that maybe each original row is split into three rows, each original column into two columns. Let's look at the structure.\n\nOriginal input has 3 rows. Output has 9 rows. So each input row is converted into 3 output rows. Similarly, input columns (2) become 4 output columns, so each input column becomes 2 output columns. So each input cell is a 3x2 block in the output.\n\nBut what's the pattern for each cell's expansion? Let's take Example 0's input. Let's look at the first input cell: 0. How does it become part of the output? The output's first row is [8,0,0,8]. Wait, maybe each input cell is part of a larger pattern where the value is mirrored or flipped in some way.\n\nWait, maybe the transformation is that each cell in the input is expanded into a 3x2 block, but the arrangement depends on the position of the cell. Let's take Example 0's input:\n\nOriginal input rows:\n\nRow 0: [0,8]\n\nRow 1: [0,0]\n\nRow 2: [0,8]\n\nThe output has 9 rows (3 input rows * 3) and 4 columns (2 input columns * 2). Let's see:\n\nLooking at the output of Example 0:\n\nFirst three rows of output:\n\n[8,0,0,8] \u2192 maybe from the first input row's elements.\n\n[0,0,0,0]\n\n[8,0,0,8]\n\nThen the next three rows (rows 3-5) repeat the same pattern. And then rows 6-8 again the same. Wait, but the output is 9 rows. So perhaps each input row is replicated three times, and each column is expanded into two columns, but with some value arrangement.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the input is being mirrored or rotated in some way. Let's think of the input as a 3x2 grid, and the output as a larger grid constructed by tiling or reflecting the input in some way.\n\nAnother approach: Let's look at the output of Example 0. The output matrix seems to have a symmetrical pattern. For instance, the first row [8,0,0,8] has 8s at the ends and 0s in the middle. Then the next row is all zeros, then the third row again [8,0,0,8]. This repeats three times. Wait, the output has 9 rows, which is 3x3. So perhaps each input element is transformed into a 3x3 block, but then again the output columns are 4, not 6. Hmm, maybe not.\n\nWait, maybe the input is treated as a 3x3 grid but with some missing elements? No, the input is 3x2 in Example 0. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is constructed by taking the original matrix and creating a larger matrix by reflecting each row and column. Let's see: For example, in Example 0's input, the first row is [0,8]. If we mirror this row, it becomes [8,0], so combining the original and mirrored gives [0,8,8,0], but the first output row is [8,0,0,8]. That's different.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each element in the input is replaced by a 3x2 block, where the value is placed in specific positions. For example, if the input cell is A, the block could have A in certain positions and zeros elsewhere.\n\nLooking at Example 0's input. The first row is [0,8]. Let's see the first three rows of output:\n\nRow 0: [8,0,0,8] \u2192 perhaps related to the 8s in the input. The 0 in the input's first cell is leading to 8 in the output's first position? That seems contradictory. Wait, maybe there's a rotation or some other operation.\n\nWait, perhaps each cell in the input is transformed into a 3x2 block, and the value is placed in a specific position. For example, the first cell (0,0) in the input (which is 0) could be placed in a certain position in the 3x2 block. But how does that relate to the output?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the input is mirrored and stacked in a specific way. Let's take Example 0's input:\n\nOriginal input is:\n\nRow 0: 0,8\n\nRow 1:0,0\n\nRow 2:0,8\n\nIf we mirror each row (reverse the elements), we get [8,0], [0,0], [8,0]. Then perhaps concatenate original and mirrored rows. Then each row becomes 4 elements. But how does this fit with the output?\n\nOriginal row 0: [0,8] \u2192 mirrored [8,0]. Concatenated would be [0,8,8,0], but the first output row is [8,0,0,8]. That doesn't match. Hmm.\n\nWait, let's look at the output of Example 0 again. The first row is [8,0,0,8]. If we split this into two parts: [8,0] and [0,8], which are the mirrored versions of the original row [0,8]. Wait, original row is [0,8]. Mirrored is [8,0]. So combining them as [8,0,0,8] would be mirrored then original? But why?\n\nAlternatively, maybe each row in the input is split into two parts, and each part is expanded into a certain way. Or maybe the entire input is transformed into a 3x3 grid, but that doesn't align with the output dimensions.\n\nLet's take another example. Example 1's input is:\n\n[2,0]\n\n[2,2]\n\n[2,0]\n\nThe output starts with [0,2,2,0], [2,2,2,2], [0,2,2,0], then repeats.\n\nSo the first output row is [0,2,2,0]. The original first row of input is [2,0]. If mirrored, it's [0,2], but the output row is [0,2,2,0], which is mirrored and then mirrored again? Like [0,2] + [2,0] \u2192 [0,2,2,0]. Oh! Wait, that's possible. So each row in the input is transformed by taking the original row and its reverse (mirror) and concatenating them. So for a row [a,b], the transformed row would be [b,a,a,b]. Wait, no. Let's see:\n\nOriginal row [a,b], reversed is [b,a]. Concatenating them would be [a,b,b,a], but in Example 0's first row [0,8], reversed is [8,0]. Concatenated would be [0,8,8,0], but the first output row is [8,0,0,8]. That's not matching. Hmm.\n\nWait, in Example 0's first input row is [0,8], and the first output row is [8,0,0,8]. So that's [8,0] followed by [0,8]. Which is reversed then original. So the output row is reversed of the input row followed by the original input row. So [8,0] + [0,8] = [8,0,0,8]. That seems to fit. Let's check other examples.\n\nIn Example 1's first input row [2,0], reversed is [0,2]. Then the output row would be [0,2,2,0], which is reversed + original. Wait, reversed is [0,2], original is [2,0], so combining reversed + original would be [0,2,2,0], which matches the first output row of Example 1. So that seems to work for the rows. So each input row is transformed into a row that is the reversed version followed by the original version, making the columns double.\n\nBut how do the rows expand from 3 to 9? Because the output has 9 rows. So each input row is transformed into three rows in the output. How?\n\nLooking at Example 0's output:\n\nThe first three rows are:\n\n[8,0,0,8]\n\n[0,0,0,0]\n\n[8,0,0,8]\n\nThen this pattern repeats two more times. So each input row is generating three rows in the output. But the middle row of each trio is all zeros.\n\nWait, the input for Example 0 has three rows. Each input row becomes three rows in the output. Let's see:\n\nInput row 0: [0,8] \u2192 output rows 0, 3, 6 (since there are three repetitions of the same three-row pattern). But in the output, the rows for input row 0 are [8,0,0,8], then [0,0,0,0], then [8,0,0,8]. Then the same for the next input rows. Wait, but the input has three rows. So for each input row, we generate three output rows, but the middle row is zeros. Then, after processing all input rows, the output has 3 input rows \u00d7 3 output rows each \u2192 9 rows.\n\nWait, but in Example 0, the input is three rows. The output is 9 rows. So each input row is expanded into three output rows, where the first and third rows of the trio are the reversed+original row, and the middle row is all zeros. Then, after processing all three input rows, the output is built.\n\nLet me verify this with Example 0:\n\nInput row 0: [0,8] \u2192 reversed is [8,0], original is [0,8]. So reversed + original \u2192 [8,0,0,8]. So the first row of the trio is [8,0,0,8], then a row of zeros, then again [8,0,0,8]. So that's three rows for each input row.\n\nSimilarly, input row 1: [0,0]. Reversed is [0,0], so reversed + original is [0,0,0,0]. So three rows: [0,0,0,0], then [0,0,0,0], then [0,0,0,0]. Wait, no. Because looking at Example 0's output, the second trio of rows (rows 3-5) are the same as the first trio. Wait, no. Let me check:\n\nExample 0's output is:\n\nRow 0: [8,0,0,8]\n\nRow 1: [0,0,0,0]\n\nRow 2: [8,0,0,8]\n\nRow 3: [8,0,0,8]\n\nRow 4: [0,0,0,0]\n\nRow 5: [8,0,0,8]\n\nRow 6: [8,0,0,8]\n\nRow 7: [0,0,0,0]\n\nRow 8: [8,0,0,8]\n\nWait, that's three copies of the same trio. But the input has three rows. So perhaps each input row is generating three trios? Or maybe the entire input is processed three times? This part is confusing.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each input row is expanded into three output rows in a way that depends on the position of the row. Let's think again.\n\nAnother approach: look for how the input elements are arranged in the output.\n\nIn Example 0, the input is:\n\nRow0: 0,8\n\nRow1:0,0\n\nRow2:0,8\n\nThe output has a lot of 8s and 0s. The first row of output is [8,0,0,8]. Let's see where the 8s come from. The input's first and third rows have 8 in the second column. So maybe the 8 in the input's (0,1) and (2,1) positions contribute to the output's first row.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each element in the input is placed in certain positions in the output's 3x2 blocks. For example, each input element is mapped to a 3x2 block where the value is placed in specific cells, and others are zeros.\n\nLooking at Example 0's input:\n\nThe element at (0,1) is 8. In the output, the first row has 8s at positions 0 and 3. Maybe each 8 in the input is placed in certain positions in the output's block.\n\nBut this might get complicated. Let's think of each input cell generating a 3x2 block. So for each input cell, there's a 3x2 block in the output. Then, since the input is 3 rows and 2 columns, the output would be 3*3=9 rows and 2*2=4 columns. That makes sense. So each input cell becomes a 3x2 block in the output. But how?\n\nIn Example 0, input cell (0,0) is 0. Its 3x2 block in the output would be:\n\nRow 0: 0,0\n\nRow 1:0,0\n\nRow 2:0,0\n\nWait, but that's not the case. Because the output's first three rows are [8,0,0,8], [0,0,0,0], [8,0,0,8]. Which seems to be a combination of the 8s from the input's (0,1) and (2,1) positions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each input cell is placed in a specific position within its 3x2 block, and then these blocks are arranged in a grid. For example, the input is 3x2, so the output would be 3*3 rows and 2*2 columns. So each input cell's block is placed in a grid.\n\nWait, perhaps the input is first transformed into a 3x2 grid of blocks, each block being 3x2. Then the output is a 9x4 matrix (3*3 rows, 2*2 columns). But how do the numbers fit?\n\nAlternatively, maybe each input cell is mapped to a 3x2 block, and then those blocks are arranged in a way that combines them. For example, the first input row's two cells generate two 3x2 blocks placed side by side, making a 3x4 output. But how do the rows add up?\n\nThis seems plausible. Let's take Example 0:\n\nInput row 0: [0,8]\n\nEach cell in this row is mapped to a 3x2 block. So 0 \u2192 3x2 block, 8 \u2192 another 3x2 block. Then these two blocks are combined horizontally (side by side), making a 3x4 block for the entire row.\n\nThen, each input row's blocks are stacked vertically. But the output has 9 rows, so each input row's 3x2 blocks must generate three rows each. Wait, but each input row is 2 cells, each generating a 3-row block. So combining them would make 3 rows. Then three input rows would generate 3*3=9 rows. That makes sense.\n\nSo the overall transformation is:\n\nFor each input cell, generate a 3x2 block. Then, for each input row, combine the blocks from each cell in that row horizontally. Then stack all the row blocks vertically.\n\nNow, the question is, how is each input cell converted into a 3x2 block?\n\nLooking at Example 0's input cell (0,0) which is 0. Its block would be part of the output's first three rows. But looking at the first three rows of the output, which are:\n\nRow 0: 8,0,0,8 \u2192 this is the combination of the two cells in input row 0. The first cell (0) would contribute the first two elements, and the second cell (8) would contribute the next two. But in row 0 of the output, the first two elements are 8 and 0, which seems to relate to the second cell (8). Wait, this is confusing.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the value of the input cell determines the pattern of the 3x2 block. Let's look for patterns in how input values are placed in the output blocks.\n\nIn Example 0's input, the cell (0,1) is 8. The first three rows of the output have 8s in positions 0 and 3. Let's see how this might come from the 8's block.\n\nIf the block for 8 is:\n\nRow 0: 8, 0\n\nRow 1:0, 8\n\nRow 2:8, 0\n\nThen combining this block with the block from the first cell (0) which is all zeros, the combined row would be:\n\n[0,0 | 8,0] \u2192 for row 0 of the block.\n\nBut the output's first row is [8,0,0,8]. Hmm, not matching.\n\nWait, maybe the blocks are arranged in a different way. For example, each cell's block is 3 rows high and 2 columns wide, and when combined horizontally, each input row's two cells' blocks form a 3x4 output row group. Then, stacking the input rows' groups vertically gives the full output.\n\nSo for input row 0: [0,8], the blocks for 0 and 8 are combined.\n\nIf the 0's block is:\n\n0 0\n\n0 0\n\n0 0\n\nAnd the 8's block is:\n\n8 0\n\n0 8\n\n8 0\n\nThen combining them horizontally, row 0 would be 0 0 8 0 \u2192 [0,0,8,0], but in the output, row 0 is [8,0,0,8]. This doesn't align.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 8's block is:\n\n8 0\n\n0 8\n\n8 0\n\nBut then combining with 0's block (all zeros), the combined rows would be:\n\nRow 0: 0 0 8 0 \u2192 [0,0,8,0]\n\nRow 1:0 0 0 8 \u2192 [0,0,0,8]\n\nRow 2:0 0 8 0 \u2192 [0,0,8,0]\n\nBut the output's first three rows are [8,0,0,8], [0,0,0,0], [8,0,0,8]. So this approach isn't matching.\n\nLet me think differently. Let's look at Example 2's input:\n\nInput:\n\n[0,0]\n\n[0,5]\n\n[5,0]\n\nOutput:\n\n[0,5,5,0]\n\n[5,0,0,5]\n\n[0,0,0,0]\n\n[0,0,0,0]\n\n[5,0,0,5]\n\n[0,5,5,0]\n\n[0,5,5,0]\n\n[5,0,0,5]\n\n[0,0,0,0]\n\nThis output has some 5s and 0s arranged in patterns. Let's see how input elements contribute.\n\nInput row 1: [0,5]. The output's first row is [0,5,5,0]. Which is the input row reversed and concatenated? [0,5] reversed is [5,0], so combining them would be [0,5,5,0]. That matches the first row. Then the second row is [5,0,0,5]. Which is [5,0] followed by [0,5]. Again, reversed then original. Wait, [5,0] is the reversed input row (from row 2 of the input, which is [5,0]), but perhaps there's a different pattern.\n\nBut perhaps the rows are constructed by mirroring the input row. So for each input row, the output rows are formed by the mirrored version of the row. But how does this explain the multiple rows in the output.\n\nAnother observation: In Example 0's output, the pattern of the rows alternates between the mirrored row and zeros. For example:\n\nRow 0: mirrored input row (8,0,0,8)\n\nRow 1: all zeros\n\nRow 2: mirrored input row again\n\nThen this repeats for each input row. But in the output, there are 9 rows, which is three times three.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is generated by taking each input row and creating three rows: the original row reversed, a row of zeros, and the original row reversed again. Then, each input row contributes three output rows, and the entire input (three rows) leads to 3\u00d73=9 output rows.\n\nBut wait, the original input row is [0,8], and the reversed row would be [8,0]. So the output rows for this input row would be [8,0,0,8], [0,0,0,0], [8,0,0,8]. But how does [8,0] become [8,0,0,8]? Oh, perhaps each reversed row is concatenated with the original row? For example, reversed [8,0] + original [0,8] gives [8,0,0,8]. So the first row is reversed then original, the second row is all zeros, third row reversed then original again. Then for each input row, this trio is generated.\n\nSo for input row [a,b], the output rows would be:\n\n[rev([a,b]) + [a,b]] \u2192 which would be [b,a,a,b]\n\nWait, no. Because in Example 1, input row is [2,0], reversed is [0,2]. So reversed + original would be [0,2,2,0], which matches the first output row of Example 1. Then the next row is [2,2,2,2], which is all 2s, perhaps the sum or maximum of the input row? Wait, original row is [2,0], sum is 2, but the row is all 2s. Or perhaps if the row contains a 2, the middle row is filled with 2s. Hmm.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nExample 1's input row is [2,0]. The output trio for this row is:\n\nRow 0: [0,2,2,0] \u2192 reversed [0,2] + original [2,0] \u2192 [0,2,2,0]\n\nRow 1: [2,2,2,2] \u2192 all 2s\n\nRow 2: [0,2,2,0]\n\nSo the middle row is filled with the maximum value in the input row. For [2,0], the maximum is 2. For Example 0's input row [0,8], the maximum is 8, so the middle row would be all 8s. But in Example 0's output, the middle row is all zeros. That contradicts.\n\nWait, no. Example 0's input row [0,8] has max 8, but the middle row in the output trio is all zeros. So that theory is incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the middle row is determined by the sum of the input row elements. But [0,8] sum is 8 \u2192 middle row all 8s. But the middle row is zeros. Doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. Maybe the middle row is all zeros if the input row contains at least one zero. But in Example 1's input row [2,0], the middle row is all 2s, which has a zero. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternative approach: Let's see if the output rows are generated by taking the original row's reversed, then some transformation, then reversed again. For example:\n\nFor each input row, generate three output rows:\n\nRow 1: reversed(row) concatenated with original row\n\nRow 2: some pattern based on the row elements\n\nRow 3: same as row 1\n\nBut the pattern for row 2 is unclear.\n\nLooking at Example 2's input:\n\nInput row 1: [0,5]\n\nOutput rows:\n\nRow 0: [0,5,5,0] \u2192 reversed([0,5]) is [5,0], concatenated with original [0,5] gives [5,0,0,5], which doesn't match. Wait, no. The output row is [0,5,5,0], which is original [0,5] followed by reversed [5,0]. So [0,5] + [5,0] = [0,5,5,0]. Then row 1 of the trio is [5,0,0,5]. Which could be reversed of the original row [0,5] \u2192 [5,0], then reversed again [0,5], so concatenated [5,0,0,5]. Then row 2 of the trio is all zeros.\n\nBut this is getting too complicated. Maybe there's a different pattern.\n\nAnother observation: The output matrices seem to have a symmetrical structure. For example, in Example 0's output, the first and third rows of each trio are the same, and the middle row is zeros. In Example 1, the first and third rows are the same, and the middle row is all 2s. In Example 2, the first trio's rows are [0,5,5,0], [5,0,0,5], [0,0,0,0].\n\nWait, in Example 2's input, the rows are:\n\nRow0: [0,0]\n\nRow1: [0,5]\n\nRow2: [5,0]\n\nThe output's first trio is:\n\n[0,5,5,0]\n\n[5,0,0,5]\n\n[0,0,0,0]\n\nSo perhaps the middle row of each trio is derived from the next input row. For example, the first trio (rows 0-2) in the output corresponds to input row 0, but uses values from input row 1. But this is speculative.\n\nAlternatively, the output is generated by combining three transformed versions of the input matrix. Like stacking the input matrix, its mirror, and another transformation vertically. But I need to find a consistent pattern.\n\nLet's try to think of the output as three sections, each corresponding to a transformation of the input. For example:\n\nEach input row is processed three times in different ways to generate three output rows. Let's see:\n\nIn Example 0, input row 0 [0,8] generates three rows in the output:\n\nRow 0: [8,0,0,8] \u2192 which is reversed row [8,0] followed by original row [0,8]\n\nRow 1: [0,0,0,0] \u2192 all zeros\n\nRow 2: [8,0,0,8] \u2192 same as row 0\n\nSimilarly, input row 1 [0,0] generates:\n\nRow 3: [0,0,0,0]\n\nRow 4: [0,0,0,0]\n\nRow 5: [0,0,0,0]\n\nInput row 2 [0,8] generates:\n\nRow 6: [8,0,0,8]\n\nRow 7: [0,0,0,0]\n\nRow 8: [8,0,0,8]\n\nSo for each input row, the first and third output rows in the trio are the reversed + original row, and the middle row is zeros. But why the middle row is zeros?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is:\n\nFor each input row, generate three output rows:\n\n- The first and third are the reversed row followed by the original row.\n\n- The middle row is the original row followed by the reversed row.\n\nWait, let's check Example 0's input row [0,8]. Reversed is [8,0].\n\nFirst row: [8,0] + [0,8] \u2192 [8,0,0,8]\n\nMiddle row: [0,8] + [8,0] \u2192 [0,8,8,0]\n\nThird row: [8,0,0,8]\n\nBut in the output, the middle row is all zeros. So this doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. Let's look at Example 1's output:\n\nInput row [2,0] \u2192 reversed [0,2].\n\nOutput trio:\n\nRow 0: [0,2,2,0] \u2192 reversed + original \u2192 [0,2] + [2,0] \u2192 [0,2,2,0]\n\nRow 1: [2,2,2,2] \u2192 all 2s\n\nRow 2: [0,2,2,0]\n\nSo the middle row is filled with the first element of the original row (2) repeated. Because the original row is [2,0], the middle row is all 2s.\n\nIn Example 0, the original row is [0,8]. The middle row is all zeros. So maybe the middle row is filled with the first element of the original row. For [0,8], first element 0 \u2192 all zeros. For [2,0], first element 2 \u2192 all 2s.\n\nExample 2's input row 1: [0,5]. Middle row is [5,0,0,5]. Wait, not sure. Let's see:\n\nExample 2's input row 1 is [0,5]. Reversed is [5,0].\n\nSo the trio would be:\n\nRow 0: [5,0,0,5]\n\nRow 1: [0,0,0,0] (if middle row is first element of original row, which is 0)\n\nRow 2: [5,0,0,5]\n\nBut according to the actual output for Example 2, the first trio is:\n\n[0,5,5,0]\n\n[5,0,0,5]\n\n[0,0,0,0]\n\nHmm, this doesn't align with the previous hypothesis.\n\nSo perhaps the pattern is different. Let's look at Example 2's input:\n\nInput rows:\n\n[0,0]\n\n[0,5]\n\n[5,0]\n\nThe output's first trio of rows is:\n\n[0,5,5,0]\n\n[5,0,0,5]\n\n[0,0,0,0]\n\nThis suggests that each input row's trio is somehow related to other rows in the input. For example, the first trio (rows 0-2) might involve input rows 0 and 1. But this is getting too vague.\n\nAnother approach: Perhaps the output is generated by creating a larger matrix that combines the input with its rotations or reflections. For example, the input is mirrored both horizontally and vertically, and combined in a certain way.\n\nAlternatively, considering that the output has 9 rows and 4 columns, which is 3x3 blocks of 3 rows each, and 2x2 blocks of 2 columns each. So each input cell is part of a 3x3 grid in the output rows and a 2x2 grid in the columns.\n\nBut this is getting too abstract. Let's try to find a pattern in how the input elements are placed in the output.\n\nIn Example 0's input:\n\nThe 8s are in positions (0,1) and (2,1). In the output, the 8s appear in positions:\n\nRow 0: 0 and 3\n\nRow 2: 0 and 3\n\nRow 3: same as row 0\n\nRow 5: same as row 0\n\nRow 6: same as row 0\n\nRow 8: same as row 0\n\nSo the 8s are in the first and fourth columns (assuming 0-based) of certain rows.\n\nBut how does this relate to the input positions?\n\nAlternatively, each 8 in the input is placed in the output at certain positions relative to their original location. For example, input cell (i,j) becomes output cells (i*3 + k, j*2 + l), where k and l are offsets based on the value.\n\nBut this would require a mapping for each cell. Let's see:\n\nFor Example 0's cell (0,1) which is 8:\n\nAssuming each cell is mapped to a 3x2 block starting at row i*3 and column j*2.\n\nSo for cell (0,1) (row 0, column 1), the block starts at row 0*3=0, column 1*2=2. So the block covers columns 2-3 and rows 0-2.\n\nIn the output, the first three rows have 8s in columns 0 and 3. This doesn't fit. So this approach may not work.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by rotating the input 90 degrees and then combining it with other transformations. For example, a combination of the original input and its rotations.\n\nBut I'm not seeing it.\n\nAnother idea: The output seems to have a diamond or checkerboard pattern in some examples. For instance, in Example 0's output, the 8s form a diamond shape. Similarly, in Example 1, the 2s form a different pattern. Maybe the input is being used to generate a larger diamond pattern where the values are placed in specific positions based on their location.\n\nAlternatively, the output is a result of matrix multiplication or convolution with a kernel. But without obvious mathematical operations, this seems unlikely.\n\nLet me try to summarize what I've observed so far:\n\n- Each input row is transformed into three output rows.\n\n- The first and third rows of each trio are formed by concatenating the reversed input row with the original row (or vice versa).\n\n- The middle row of each trio is filled with a value that seems to relate to the input row's elements. In Example 0's case, it's zeros; in Example 1, it's the first element of the row; in Example 2, it's different.\n\nBut this doesn't hold for Example 2. Let's look again:\n\nExample 2's input row 1 is [0,5]. The trio is:\n\nRow 0: [0,5,5,0]\n\nRow 1: [5,0,0,5]\n\nRow 2: [0,0,0,0]\n\nSo the middle row is [5,0,0,5], which is the reversed row [5,0] followed by the reversed row again [5,0] \u2192 [5,0,5,0] \u2192 no, but the actual row is [5,0,0,5]. Hmm. Wait, [5,0] followed by [0,5]. So reversed then original again? No, original is [0,5], reversed is [5,0]. So reversed + original is [5,0,0,5]. But that's what row 1 of the trio is. So perhaps for the middle row, it's reversed + original. Then why in Example 0's trio, the middle row is all zeros?\n\nIn Example 0's input row 0 [0,8], reversed is [8,0]. So reversed + original would be [8,0,0,8]. But the first row of the trio is [8,0,0,8], and the middle row is zeros. That doesn't fit.\n\nThis inconsistency suggests that there's a different pattern. Maybe the middle row depends on the previous or next row in the input.\n\nAlternatively, the pattern is that the first and third rows of the trio are reversed + original, and the middle row is the sum of the current row and the next row's elements. But this is a guess.\n\nIn Example 0's input row 0 [0,8], next row is [0,0]. Sum of elements 0+0=0. So middle row is filled with 0. That fits. For Example 1's input row 0 [2,0], next row is [2,2]. Sum of elements is 4. But the middle row is filled with 2s. So sum divided by 2 (average). Hmm, maybe.\n\nExample 2's input row 0 [0,0], next row is [0,5]. Sum is 0+5=5. Middle row in the trio for row 0 is [5,0,0,5]. Wait, but how does that fit?\n\nThis is getting too convoluted. Let's try to look for another approach.\n\nLooking at the test input:\n\nTest input:\n\n[3,3]\n\n[3,0]\n\n[3,3]\n\nWe need to generate the output based on the pattern.\n\nAssuming that each input row is transformed into three output rows, where the first and third rows are reversed + original, and the middle row is based on some condition.\n\nFor example, in Example 0's input row [0,8], reversed is [8,0]. So first and third rows are [8,0,0,8]. Middle row is zeros. In Example 1's input row [2,0], reversed is [0,2], so first and third rows are [0,2,2,0]. Middle row is all 2s. So perhaps the middle row is filled with the first element of the original row.\n\nFor Example 0's row [0,8], first element is 0 \u2192 middle row zeros.\n\nFor Example 1's row [2,0], first element is 2 \u2192 middle row 2s.\n\nFor Example 2's input row [0,5], middle row is [5,0,0,5]. The first element is 0, but the middle row starts with 5. So this theory is incorrect.\n\nAlternative hypothesis: The middle row is filled with the maximum value in the row. Example 0's row [0,8] \u2192 max is 8, but middle row is zeros. Doesn't fit.\n\nAnother thought: The middle row is filled with the sum of the elements in the row. Example 0's row sum is 8 \u2192 middle row all 8s. But in Example 0's output, the middle row is zeros. So no.\n\nWait, perhaps the middle row is all zeros if the input row has a zero. In Example 0's row [0,8] has a zero \u2192 middle row zeros. Example 1's row [2,0] has a zero \u2192 middle row is all 2s. Doesn't fit. Example 2's row [0,5] has a zero \u2192 middle row is [5,0,0,5]. Not zeros.\n\nThis is really challenging. Let's try to find a different angle.\n\nLooking at the output matrices, they seem to have a structure where each trio of rows corresponds to an input row. For example, in Example 0's output, each trio is the same pattern: [8,0,0,8], [0,0,0,0], [8,0,0,8]. This pattern is repeated three times. Wait, but the input has three rows. So why is the output's trio pattern repeated three times? Maybe each input row generates three trios, but that would lead to 9 trios (27 rows), which is not the case.\n\nAlternatively, the entire input matrix is processed three times in some way. For example, the input matrix is tripled vertically. But how does that lead to the output?\n\nLet me try to count the output rows. All examples have 9 rows. Input has 3 rows. So 3\u00d73. So perhaps each input row is expanded into three output rows, and the pattern for each row's expansion depends on the row's position (e.g., first, middle, last row of the input).\n\nLooking at Example 0's input:\n\nRow0: [0,8]\n\nRow1: [0,0]\n\nRow2: [0,8]\n\nOutput has 9 rows. The first three rows correspond to Row0, next three to Row1, and last three to Row2.\n\nFor Row0's trio:\n\n[8,0,0,8]\n\n[0,0,0,0]\n\n[8,0,0,8]\n\nFor Row1's trio:\n\n[0,0,0,0]\n\n[0,0,0,0]\n\n[0,0,0,0]\n\nFor Row2's trio:\n\n[8,0,0,8]\n\n[0,0,0,0]\n\n[8,0,0,8]\n\nThis suggests that each input row is expanded into three output rows. The first and third rows of the trio are determined by the input row's elements, and the middle row is all zeros.\n\nBut in Example 1's input:\n\nRow0: [2,0]\n\nRow1: [2,2]\n\nRow2: [2,0]\n\nOutput's first trio for Row0:\n\n[0,2,2,0]\n\n[2,2,2,2]\n\n[0,2,2,0]\n\nRow1's trio:\n\n[2,2,2,2]\n\n[2,2,2,2]\n\n[2,2,2,2]\n\nRow2's trio:\n\n[0,2,2,0]\n\n[2,2,2,2]\n\n[0,2,2,0]\n\nSo for each input row, the middle row of the trio is filled with the first element of the row. For example:\n\nRow0 has first element 2 \u2192 middle row is all 2s.\n\nRow1 has first element 2 \u2192 middle row all 2s.\n\nRow2 same as row0.\n\nIn Example 0, the input rows have first element 0 \u2192 middle row zeros.\n\nIn Example 2's input:\n\nRow0: [0,0]\n\nRow1: [0,5]\n\nRow2: [5,0]\n\nOutput's first trio (Row0):\n\n[0,5,5,0]\n\n[5,0,0,5]\n\n[0,0,0,0]\n\nRow1's trio:\n\n[5,0,0,5]\n\n[0,0,0,0]\n\n[5,0,0,5]\n\nRow2's trio:\n\n[0,0,0,0]\n\n[0,0,0,0]\n\n[0,0,0,0]\n\nWait, this seems inconsistent. For Row0 of Example 2's input, the middle row of the trio is [5,0,0,5], which is not related to the first element of the row (0). So this theory doesn't hold.\n\nAnother possibility: The middle row of the trio is derived from the next input row. For example, the trio for input row i uses elements from row i+1. But for the last row, it wraps around.\n\nIn Example 0's input, trio for row 0's middle row is row 1's elements. Row1 is [0,0], so middle row is all zeros. That fits. Trio for row 1's middle row uses row 2's elements. Row2 is [0,8], reversed + original would be [8,0,0,8], but the middle row for row1's trio is zeros. Doesn't fit.\n\nThis is really tricky. Let's try to formulate a rule based on the examples.\n\nFor each input row, generate three output rows:\n\n- First row: reversed row concatenated with original row \u2192 [b,a,a,b]\n\n- Third row: same as first row\n\n- Middle row: if the original row has a non-zero element, fill with the maximum value, but in Example 0, the row [0,8] has max 8, but the middle row is zeros. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, the middle row is the sum of the current row and the next row. For Example 0's row0: [0,8] and row1: [0,0], sum is [0+0, 8+0] = [0,8]. Reversed + original \u2192 [8,0,0,8]. But the middle row is zeros. Doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, the middle row is the original row followed by the reversed row. For Example 0's row0: [0,8] \u2192 [0,8,8,0]. But the middle row is zeros. No.\n\nLet me think of the test input and see what the expected output would be based on examples.\n\nTest input:\n\n[3,3]\n\n[3,0]\n\n[3,3]\n\nFollowing Example 0's pattern, each input row would generate three output rows. For the first row [3,3], the first and third rows of the trio would be reversed + original \u2192 [3,3,3,3]. Because reversed [3,3] is the same as original, so concatenated would be [3,3,3,3]. The middle row would be all 3s (since the first element is 3), similar to Example 1's middle row being filled with the first element. Then the trio would be:\n\n[3,3,3,3]\n\n[3,3,3,3]\n\n[3,3,3,3]\n\nBut in Example 0's row0, the first element is 0, and middle row is zeros. In Example 1's row0, first element is 2, middle row is all 2s. So this pattern seems to hold.\n\nThen for the second row of the input [3,0], the first element is 3. So the trio would be:\n\nReversed row [0,3] + original [3,0] \u2192 [0,3,3,0]\n\nMiddle row all 3s \u2192 [3,3,3,3]\n\nThird row [0,3,3,0]\n\nThird input row [3,3], same as first row \u2192 trio of all [3,3,3,3] rows.\n\nSo putting it all together, the output would be:\n\n[3,3,3,3]\n\n[3,3,3,3]\n\n[3,3,3,3]\n\n[0,3,3,0]\n\n[3,3,3,3]\n\n[0,3,3,0]\n\n[3,3,3,3]\n\n[3,3,3,3]\n\n[3,3,3,3]\n\nBut wait, looking at Example 1's input row [2,0], the trio is [0,2,2,0], [2,2,2,2], [0,2,2,0]. Which matches the pattern where reversed + original is first and third rows, middle row filled with first element.\n\nSo applying this to the test input:\n\nInput row0: [3,3]\n\nReversed is [3,3] \u2192 reversed + original is [3,3,3,3]\n\nMiddle row is filled with first element (3), so all 3s.\n\nThird row same as first.\n\nInput row1: [3,0]\n\nReversed is [0,3] \u2192 reversed + original is [0,3,3,0]\n\nMiddle row filled with 3s \u2192 [3,3,3,3]\n\nThird row same as first.\n\nInput row2: [3,3], same as row0 \u2192 trio same as row0.\n\nSo the output would be:\n\n[3,3,3,3]\n\n[3,3,3,3]\n\n[3,3,3,3]\n\n[0,3,3,0]\n\n[3,3,3,3]\n\n[0,3,3,0]\n\n[3,3,3,3]\n\n[3,3,3,3]\n\n[3,3,3,3]\n\nBut let's check Example 2's input to see if this pattern holds. Example 2's input row1 is [0,5], first element is 0. According to the pattern, the middle row should be all zeros. But in Example 2's output, the middle row for input row1 is [5,0,0,5]. So this contradicts the previous theory.\n\nThis suggests that the pattern is not consistent across all examples. Therefore, there must be a different pattern.\n\nLet me revisit Example 2's output:\n\nInput row0: [0,0]\n\nReversed is [0,0]. So first and third rows of the trio would be [0,0,0,0]. Middle row would be all zeros. But the actual output trio for row0 is:\n\n[0,5,5,0]\n\n[5,0,0,5]\n\n[0,0,0,0]\n\nThis suggests that the first trio is not based solely on the first input row. It must be influenced by other rows in the input.\n\nMaybe the output is generated by combining the input matrix with its transposed or other transformations.\n\nAlternatively, the output is built by arranging the input elements in a larger matrix where each element is placed in a pattern based on its position.\n\nAlternatively, the output is a 3x3 tiling of the input matrix, but I'm not sure.\n\nAnother idea: The output is constructed by placing each element of the input in a specific position in a 3x3 grid, and then expanding that grid into the output. For example, each input element is placed in the center of a 3x3 block, and surrounding elements are filled based on certain rules. But this would require more analysis.\n\nAlternatively, the output is a combination of the input and its rotations. For example, the input is rotated 90 degrees, 180 degrees, 270 degrees, and combined in some way.\n\nBut given the time I've spent and the lack of progress, I think I need to make an educated guess based on the examples, especially the test input.\n\nGiven the test input:\n\n[3,3]\n\n[3,0]\n\n[3,3]\n\nFollowing the pattern observed in Example 1, where the input row is [2,0] and the output trio is [0,2,2,0], [2,2,2,2], [0,2,2,0], it's likely that each input row's trio has the first and third rows as reversed + original, and the middle row filled with the first element of the row.\n\nSo for the test input:\n\nRow0: [3,3] \u2192 reversed is [3,3]. So first and third rows are [3,3,3,3]. Middle row is all 3s.\n\nRow1: [3,0] \u2192 reversed is [0,3]. So first and third rows are [0,3,3,0]. Middle row is all 3s.\n\nRow2: [3,3] \u2192 same as row0.\n\nThus, the output would be:\n\n[3,3,3,3]\n\n[3,3,3,3]\n\n[3,3,3,3]\n\n[0,3,3,0]\n\n[3,3,3,3]\n\n[0,3,3,0]\n\n[3,3,3,3]\n\n[3,3,3,3]\n\n[3,3,3,3]\n\nBut let's check if this matches any of the examples. Example 1's input row [2,0] gives the trio [0,2,2,0], [2,2,2,2], [0,2,2,0], which aligns with this pattern. Example 0's input row [0,8] gives [8,0,0,8], [0,0,0,0], [8,0,0,8], which also fits: first element 0 \u2192 middle row zeros.\n\nExample 2's input row [0,5] would generate [5,0,0,5], [0,0,0,0], [5,0,0,5], but the actual output for Example 2's first trio is:\n\n[0,5,5,0]\n\n[5,0,0,5]\n\n[0,0,0,0]\n\nThis doesn't fit the previous pattern. So there's inconsistency here.\n\nAh, maybe the middle row is filled with the second element of the row. For Example 0's row0 [0,8], second element 8 \u2192 middle row filled with 8s, but the middle row is zeros. No.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the middle row is filled with the sum of the two elements in the row. For Example 0's row0 sum is 8 \u2192 middle row filled with 8s. But the middle row is zeros. So no.\n\nThis is really confusing. But given the test input and the pattern observed in Examples 0 and 1, it's plausible that each trio's middle row is filled with the first element of the input row.\n\nSo for the test input, applying this:\n\nRow0: [3,3]\n\nFirst and third rows: reversed [3,3] + original [3,3] \u2192 [3,3,3,3]\n\nMiddle row: all 3s.\n\nRow1: [3,0]\n\nFirst and third rows: [0,3,3,0]\n\nMiddle row: all 3s.\n\nRow2: [3,3] \u2192 same as row0.\n\nSo the output would be:\n\n[3,3,3,3]\n\n[3,3,3,3]\n\n[3,3,3,3]\n\n[0,3,3,0]\n\n[3,3,3,3]\n\n[0,3,3,0]\n\n[3,3,3,3]\n\n[3,3,3,3]\n\n[3,3,3,3]\n\nWhich matches the pattern from Examples 0 and 1. However, Example 2 doesn't fit this, but perhaps there's a different rule for when the input has certain properties. Since the test input is similar to Examples 0 and 1 (middle row filled with first element), this seems plausible.\n\nThus, the final answer should be structured with each input row's trio following this pattern."
