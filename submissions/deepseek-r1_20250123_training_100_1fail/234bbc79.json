        "cot_1": "Okay, let's tackle this puzzle. So, we have these input and output examples, and we need to figure out the pattern that transforms the input into the output. Then apply that to the test input. Hmm. Let's start by looking closely at the training examples to see if I can spot any patterns.\n\nLooking at Example 0 first. The input has three rows. Let's compare the input and output.\n\nOriginal input rows (each is a list of numbers):\nRow 0: [0,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\nRow 1: [2,2,0,5,1,0,5,2,2]\nRow 2: [0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,0]\n\nOutput rows:\nRow0: [0,2,1,1,0,0,0]\nRow1: [2,2,0,1,2,2,2]\nRow2: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nHmm, the output rows are shorter than the input rows. Let's check the lengths. Input rows have 9 elements each, outputs have 7. So maybe some elements are merged or combined. Let's look at how they might be transformed.\n\nLooking at the first output row: [0,2,1,1,0,0,0]. Let's see how this could come from the input rows. The input's row 0 starts with 0,5,0,0... Maybe the 5 is being transformed? The output starts with 0,2... Wait, in input row1's first elements are 2,2. Maybe there's a vertical processing here? Like combining numbers from the three rows in some way.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by looking at each column in the input and applying a rule. Let's check the columns.\n\nIn the input for Example 0, each column has three numbers (from each row). For example, the first column is 0,2,0. The output's first element is 0. Maybe taking the sum? 0+2+0=2, but output is 0. Hmm. Not sum. Maybe taking the maximum? The max of 0,2,0 is 2, but output is 0. That doesn't fit. So maybe not per column.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps each row in the output is derived from the same row in the input, but with some transformation. Let's check input row0 to output row0.\n\nInput row0: [0,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0] becomes [0,2,1,1,0,0,0]. Wait, where do the 2 and 1s come from? The input row0 has a 5. The output starts with 0,2. Maybe the 5 is replaced by numbers from the row below? Like, perhaps looking at the adjacent elements in the same row or other rows.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 5s in the input are acting as some sort of markers. Let's see where 5s are in Example0's input. In row0, position1 is 5. Row1 has 5 at position3 and 6. Row2 has 5 at position4. So output row0 starts with 0,2,1,1... Maybe when a 5 is present in the same or adjacent rows, certain transformations happen.\n\nWait, output row0's second element is 2. The input row1's first two elements are 2,2. Maybe the 5 in row0's position1 is causing the elements from row1 to be included. Let's see. For example, the 5 in row0 at position1 could trigger taking the elements from row1 at positions1 and maybe adjacent. Hmm, but output row0's second element is 2 (same as row1's first element). Not sure.\n\nAnother approach: let's look at all the training examples for possible patterns.\n\nExample1:\n\nInput rows:\n[0,0,0,5,1,5,0,0,0,0,0]\n[2,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,3,3]\n[0,5,0,0,0,0,0,5,3,0,0]\n\nOutput:\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n[2,2,0,0,0,0,3,3,3]\n[0,2,1,1,1,3,3,0,0]\n\nLooking at the third output row [0,2,1,1,1,3,3,0,0]. The input row2 has 5s at positions1 and 7. The output row2 has 2, 1s, 3s. Maybe when there's a 5 in a row, the output takes values from the row below or above? For example, the 5 in input row2 (position1) could lead to taking the value from row1's same position, which is 2. Then, perhaps adjacent elements are merged or transformed.\n\nIn Example1's input row0, there's a 5 at position3 and 5. The output row0 is all zeros except for the first element. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the process is to collapse the input rows by merging certain elements. Let's check the lengths. For example, in Example0, the input rows are length9, output length7. So perhaps each output element is formed by combining three consecutive elements from the input, but that doesn't fit 9 to 7 (9 - 3 +1 =7). Let's see. For input row0, first three elements are 0,5,0. How does that become the first output element 0? Maybe sum or max. 0+5+0=5, but output is 0. Not matching. So maybe another approach.\n\nWait, perhaps the transformation is about the 5s acting as separators. Let's see: in Example0's input row0, the 5 is at position1. Maybe the output is constructed by taking elements between 5s. But the output row0 starts with 0,2,1,1... Maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, the 5s are being replaced by the sum or some value from adjacent rows. For example, in Example0's input row0, position1 is 5. The output row0's position1 is 2. Looking at row1's position1, which is 2. So perhaps 5 is replaced by the value from the row below. But then in row0's position1, which is 5, replaced by row1's position1 (2), leading to output 2. Then the output row0 starts with 0,2... Then, the next elements: the third element in output row0 is 1. Looking at input row1's position2 is 0. Hmm, maybe not directly.\n\nAnother thought: Maybe each 5 in a row causes a certain operation. Like, when a 5 is found in a row, the next elements are replaced by values from another row. Let's look at Example0's input row0. The 5 is at position1. Then, the output row0's elements after position0 (0) are 2,1,1,0... Looking at row1's elements starting from position0: 2,2,0,5,1,0,5,2,2. So output row0's elements might be taking from row1's elements, but shifted. Like, output row0 starts at 0 (same as input row0's first element), then next is 2 (row1's first element), then 1 (maybe from row1's third element? Not sure). Alternatively, perhaps the 5 in row0 triggers taking elements from the row below (row1) for the next elements.\n\nWait, output row0 in Example0 is [0,2,1,1,0,0,0]. Let's compare to row1's elements. Row1 starts with 2,2,0,5,1,0,5,2,2. So output row0's elements after 0 are 2 (from row1[0]), 1 (maybe from row1[4]?), but not sure. This seems inconsistent.\n\nLooking at another example. Example2's input:\n\nInput rows:\n\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,0]\n[2,2,2,0,5,8,8,0,0,0,0]\n[0,0,5,0,0,0,0,0,5,6,6]\n\nOutput:\n\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n[2,2,2,0,0,8,6,6,6]\n[0,0,2,8,8,8,0,0,0]\n\nThe output row2 is [0,0,2,8,8,8,0,0,0]. Let's see input row2 has 5 at position2 and 8. The output row2 has 2 and 8s. Maybe when there's a 5 in a row, it's replaced by elements from the row above. So input row2's position2 is 5, so output takes from row1's position2, which is 2. Then, input row2 has 5 at position8, which would take from row1's position8, but row1's position8 is 0. Hmm, but output row2 has 8s. Alternatively, maybe the 5 in row2 triggers taking the next elements from the row above. For example, in input row2, position2 is 5. The output row2's position2 is 2, which matches row1's position2 (2). Then the next elements in row1 after position2 are 0,5,8,8,0... but output row2 has 8,8,8. Hmm, perhaps not directly.\n\nAlternatively, maybe when a 5 is present in any row, the corresponding position in the output is replaced by the sum of the elements from the other rows. Let's check Example0's row0 position1 is 5. The other rows are row1's position1 is 2 and row2's position1 is 0. Sum is 2+0=2. The output row0's position1 is 2. That matches. Then, for row1's position3, which is 5 in input. The other rows at position3: row0 is 0 and row2 is 0. Sum is 0+0=0. But output row1's position3 is 1. Wait, that doesn't fit. So maybe that's not it.\n\nWait, in Example0's output row1: [2,2,0,1,2,2,2]. The input row1 has 5s at positions3 and 6. For position3: input row1 is 5. Other rows: row0 is 0, row2 is 0. Sum is 0. But output here is 1. Hmm, maybe not sum.\n\nAnother approach: let's look for how the output rows are constructed. Maybe each output row is a combination of elements from the input rows, but with 5s acting as a kind of 'bridge' to take elements from other rows.\n\nFor example, in Example0's output row0: [0,2,1,1,0,0,0]. The first element is 0 (same as input row0's first element). The second element is 2, which is from input row1's first element. Then the third element is 1, maybe from input row1's fourth element (which is 5?), no. Wait, input row1's elements are [2,2,0,5,1,0,5,2,2]. So position0:2, position1:2, position2:0, position3:5, etc. So output row0's third element is 1. Where does that come from? Input row1's position4 is 1. Maybe the 5s in row0 and row1 are causing elements to be taken from adjacent positions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe when a 5 is present in a row, the corresponding position in the output is filled with the value from the row below. For example, in Example0's input row0 has a 5 at position1. The output row0's position1 is 2, which is the value from row1's position1. Then, the next positions might involve some propagation. But this is getting a bit vague.\n\nLet's look at Example3:\n\nInput:\n\nRow0: [0,1,5,0,0,0,0,0,2,2,0]\nRow1: [1,1,0,0,5,2,0,5,2,0,0]\nRow2: [0,0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nOutput:\n\nRow0: [0,1,1,2,2,0,2,2]\nRow1: [1,1,0,0,2,2,2,0]\nRow2: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nLooking at input row0's third element is 5. The output row0's third element is 2. In row1, the element at position8 is 2. Not sure. Alternatively, row0's 5 at position2. The output row0's position2 is 1. Hmm. Maybe the 5 in row0's position2 leads to taking the value from row1's position2, which is 0. But output is 1. Doesn't match.\n\nAlternatively, the 5s in the input are replaced by the sum of the elements in the same column across the other rows. For example, in Example0's input row0 position1 is 5. The other rows are 2 (row1) and 0 (row2). Sum is 2+0=2. Output row0 position1 is 2. That works. Then in row1's position3 is 5. Other rows: row0 has 0 and row2 has 0. Sum is 0. Output row1's position3 is 1. Hmm, doesn't fit. So maybe that's not the rule.\n\nWait, in Example3's input row1 has 5s at positions4 and 7. Let's check the output for row1. The output row1 is [1,1,0,0,2,2,2,0]. The input row1's 5 at position4: other rows at position4 are row0 has 0, row2 has 0. Sum is 0. But output row1's position4 is 2. That doesn't fit. So maybe the sum idea isn't correct.\n\nAlternative approach: maybe each 5 in a row is replaced by the value from the row below, and then some merging happens. Let's look at Example0 again. Input row0 has 5 at position1. Replacing with row1's position1 (2). Then maybe the output is constructed by merging adjacent elements when 5 is present. But how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 5s are acting as markers to split the row into segments, and each segment is processed by taking the maximum or some other value. For example, in Example0's row0, split by 5: segments are [0], [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]. But the output row0 starts with 0,2,1,1,0... Not sure.\n\nLet's think about the outputs. In Example0's output row0, after the initial 0, there's 2, then two 1s, then zeros. The row1 output starts with 2,2, then 0,1,2,2,2. Maybe the 1s are coming from the 5 in row1's position3. Let's see: input row1's position3 is 5. Output row1's position3 is 1. Hmm, where does 1 come from? Input row1's position4 is 1. Maybe when a 5 is found, the next element is taken. So in row1, position3 is 5, so output takes the next element (1) from input row1's position4. Then, the 5 at position6 in row1 would take the next element 5 (position7 is 2?), no. Wait, input row1's elements are [2,2,0,5,1,0,5,2,2]. Position3 is 5, next element is 1. So output row1's position3 is 1. Then, position6 is 5, next element is 2. But output row1's position4 is 2. So maybe when there's a 5, the next element is taken and placed in the output. But then how does the length decrease?\n\nAlternatively, maybe when a 5 is encountered, it's replaced by the next non-zero value in that row. For example, in row0's 5 (Example0), the next elements are zeros, but the output has a 2. Not sure.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps the output rows are the result of collapsing the input rows by removing 5s and replacing them with adjacent values. Let's look at Example0's row0. Input is [0,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]. If we remove the 5 and merge the adjacent elements, but how? The output row0 is [0,2,1,1,0,0,0]. Maybe when a 5 is present, it's replaced by elements from the row below. So in row0's position1 (5), replaced by row1's position1 (2), then perhaps the next elements are taken from row1's next positions. For example, after replacing 5 with 2, maybe the next element (0 in row0) is replaced by row1's next element (0) but not sure. This doesn't fully explain the 1s.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output rows are the sum of the three input rows, but with some modification. Let's check Example0's output row0. Input row0 sum: 0+5+0+0+0+0+0+0+0=5. Output row0 has sum 0+2+1+1+0+0+0=4. Doesn't match. Example1's output row2 sum is 0+2+1+1+1+3+3+0+0= 11. Input rows: row0 sum is 5+1+5=11, row1 sum is 2+2+3+3+3=13, row2 sum is 5+5+3=13. Not sure if that's a pattern.\n\nHmm. Maybe the process involves each 5 in the input acting as a point where the value from another row is taken, and then adjacent elements are merged in some way. Let's look at Example3's input:\n\nRow0: [0,1,5,0,0,0,0,0,2,2,0]\nRow1: [1,1,0,0,5,2,0,5,2,0,0]\nRow2: [0,0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nOutput row0: [0,1,1,2,2,0,2,2]\n\nLooking at input row0's 5 at position2. Output row0's position2 is 1. In row1's position2 is 0. Hmm, not matching. Alternatively, in row1's position4 is 5. Output row1's position4 is 2. The input row1's position5 is 2. Maybe when a 5 is present, the next element in the same row is used. For example, input row1's position4 is 5, next element is 2. So output row1's position4 is 2. Similarly, input row0's position2 is 5, next element is 0. But output row0's position2 is 1. Not matching.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 5s are replaced by the value from the row below. For example, input row0's position2 is 5. Row1's position2 is 0. So output row0's position2 would be 0. But in the output, it's 1. Doesn't fit.\n\nMaybe the output is constructed by processing each row and, whenever there's a 5, merging it with the next element or something. Alternatively, maybe the output rows are formed by a combination of the three input rows, where each output element is the first non-zero value encountered when moving down the columns. For example, for each column, take the first non-zero value from top to bottom.\n\nLet's check Example0. The first column has 0 (row0), 2 (row1), 0 (row2). So output would take 2. But the output row0's first element is 0. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, take the first non-zero from the bottom up. So for the first column: row2 is 0, row1 is 2, row0 is 0. So first non-zero is 2. Output row0's first element is 0. Hmm, no.\n\nAnother angle: the output rows have lengths that are 2 less than the input rows in some cases. For example, in Example0, input length9, output7. 9-2=7. Example1's input length11, output9. 11-2=9. Example2's input length11, output9. Example3's input length11, output8. Wait, but Example3's output is 8, which is 11-3. So maybe the length change isn't consistent. Hmm. Maybe the outputs are formed by removing certain elements, like 5s and their adjacent elements. But in Example0's input row0 has a single 5. The output row0 is shorter by 2. So maybe each 5 and its adjacent elements are removed. But the output row0 in Example0 has 7 elements, input 9. 9-2=7, which is the case here. So maybe each 5 and its previous and next elements are removed, thus reducing the length by 3 each time. But in Example0's input row0, there's only one 5. So removing three elements would reduce the length by 3, but the output is shorter by 2. Doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 5s are removed, and their positions are filled by some other elements. For example, in Example0's row0, the 5 is at position1. So removing it, the row becomes 8 elements. But output row0 is 7 elements. So not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by collapsing the input rows by replacing each 5 with the sum or a value from another row, and then merging adjacent zeros. But not sure.\n\nAnother approach: look at the output rows and see if they have elements from the input rows but shifted or transformed.\n\nFor Example0's output row0: [0,2,1,1,0,0,0]. The 2 and 1s might come from row1. Let's see row1's elements: [2,2,0,5,1,0,5,2,2]. So 2,2,0,5,1,0,5,2,2. The output row0 has 2, then 1,1. Maybe taking elements from row1 where row0 has 5. For example, in input row0's position1 is 5. So in output row0's position1, we take row1's position1 (2). Then, maybe the next elements are taken from row1's next positions where row0 has 0. For example, row0's position2 is 0, so take row1's position2 (0), but output row0's position2 is 1. Doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe after a 5 in row0, we start taking elements from row1 until the next 5 in row0. But Example0's row0 has only one 5. So after position1, the output row0's elements are 2,1,1, etc., which might correspond to row1's elements starting at position1: 2,0,5,1,0,5,2,2. But how does that translate to 2,1,1...? Maybe skipping some elements.\n\nWait, maybe the 5s in any row are replaced by the values from the row below, and then adjacent elements are merged if they are the same. For example, in Example0's row0, position1 is 5 replaced by row1's position1 (2). So the new row0 would be [0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]. But the output row0 is shorter and has 2,1,1. Not matching.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 5s are replaced by the sum of the numbers from the rows below and above. Let's see Example0's row0, position1: 5 replaced by row1's 2 + row2's 0 = 2. Then, the output row0's position1 is 2. But how do we get the subsequent 1,1?\n\nHmm, this is getting complicated. Let's try to find another pattern.\n\nLooking at Example3's output row0: [0,1,1,2,2,0,2,2]. The input row0 has 5 at position2. The output row0 at position2 is 1. The input row1's position2 is 0, row2's position2 is 0. Not helpful. Alternatively, maybe the 5 in row0 is replaced by the next non-zero value in the same row. But the next elements in row0 after 5 are all zeros. Not helpful.\n\nWait, maybe the output is formed by taking each row and replacing the 5s with the values from the row below, then removing the 5s and shifting elements. For example, in Example0's row0, replace the 5 with row1's element (2), then collapse the array by removing the 5. But the output row0 is shorter, which might be due to merging adjacent elements when a 5 is removed.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each 5 is replaced by the value from the row below, and then consecutive identical numbers are merged into one. For example, in Example0's row0 after replacing 5 with 2: [0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]. Then merging consecutive duplicates: [0,2,0]. But the output is longer than that. Not matching.\n\nAnother idea: the output rows are generated by looking at each row and, whenever there's a 5, inserting elements from the row below, and then truncating to a certain length. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is derived by a convolution-like process, where each element in the output is a combination of the same and adjacent elements from all three rows. For example, each output element is the sum of the three elements vertically and their immediate neighbors horizontally. But this seems complex and I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output rows are created by taking the first occurrence of a non-zero element in each column across the three rows, and then collapsing the rows into a single row. But in Example0's output, there are three rows, so that doesn't fit.\n\nAnother approach: notice that in the outputs, some elements are lower than the input's. For example, in Example0's row1, there are 5s in the input that become 1s in the output. Maybe the 5s are being replaced by the count of adjacent non-zero elements. For example, a 5 in input row1's position3 (Example0) is surrounded by 0 and 1. Maybe count of non-zero neighbors. But in this case, neighbors in row1 are 0 (left) and 1 (right). So count 1. Output is 1. That matches. Then, another 5 in row1's position6. Neighbors are 0 (left) and 2 (right). Count is 1. Output here is 2. Doesn't fit. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, when a 5 is present, it's replaced by the sum of the two adjacent elements in the same row. For Example0's row1's position3 (5), adjacent elements are 0 and 1. Sum is 1. Output is 1. That fits. Another 5 in row1's position6. Adjacents are 0 and 2. Sum is 2. Output is 2. That fits. Oh, this might work!\n\nLet's check this hypothesis. So the rule could be: for each 5 in the input, replace it with the sum of its immediate left and right neighbors in the same row. All other numbers stay the same. But how does this explain the output rows and their lengths?\n\nWait, let's apply this to Example0's row1 input: [2,2,0,5,1,0,5,2,2].\n\nFor the first 5 at position3: left is 0, right is 1. Sum is 1. So replaced by 1. Second 5 at position6: left is 0, right is 2. Sum is 2. So replaced by 2. So row1 becomes [2,2,0,1,1,0,2,2,2]. But the output row1 is [2,2,0,1,2,2,2]. The length is shorter. So maybe after replacing the 5s, the row is shortened by removing zeros or something.\n\nWait, the output row1 in Example0 is [2,2,0,1,2,2,2]. The processed row would be [2,2,0,1,1,0,2,2,2]. But the output is shorter. Maybe after replacing 5s, adjacent zeros are merged into a single zero. For example, the original processed row has 0,1,1,0. If we merge consecutive zeros, perhaps the zeros are collapsed. But then the 0,1,1,0 would become 0,1,1,0, which is four elements. But output has 0,1, followed by 2s. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe after replacing 5s, the entire array is processed to remove any zeros. But in Example0's output row1, there's a 0 in position2. So that's not it.\n\nAnother angle: the length of the output rows is determined by the number of non-zero elements after replacing 5s. But in Example0's row0, the output has non-zeros in the first few positions. Not sure.\n\nLet's try applying the rule of replacing 5s with sum of neighbors and see what happens.\n\nExample0's row0 input: [0,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]. The 5 is at position1. Left neighbor is 0, right is 0. Sum is 0. So replaced by 0. So row0 becomes [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]. But output row0 is [0,2,1,1,0,0,0]. Doesn't match. So this hypothesis is incorrect.\n\nHmm, back to square one. Let's look for another pattern.\n\nLooking at Example1's output row2: [0,2,1,1,1,3,3,0,0]. Input row2 has 5s at positions1 and 7. Let's see:\n\nInput row2: [0,5,0,0,0,0,0,5,3,0,0]\n\nIf we replace 5s with something. Let's see output row2 has 2,1,1,1,3,3. Maybe the 5s are replaced by values from other rows. For example, the first 5 in row2's position1: maybe take row1's position1 (2). So output becomes 0,2... Then the second 5 at position7: row1's position7 is 0. So replaced by 0, but output has 3,3. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, the 5s are replaced by the sum of the elements above and below. For the first 5 in row2's position1: row1's position1 is 0 (since input row1 is [2,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,3,3])? Wait, Example1's input row1 is [2,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,3,3]. So position1 is 2. Row0's position1 is 0 (input row0 is [0,0,0,5,1,5,0,0,0,0,0]). So sum of row0 and row1 at position1: 0+2=2. Output row2's position1 is 2. That fits. Then the next 5 in row2's position7: row0's position7 is 0, row1's position7 is 0. Sum is 0. But output row2's position5 is 3. Doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, when a 5 is in row2, take the value from row1's same position. So row2's position1 has 5 \u2192 row1's position1 is 2 \u2192 output is 2. Then, row2's position7 has 5 \u2192 row1's position7 is 0. But output row2's position7 is 0. But in the output row2, position7 is 0. So that fits. But the output row2 has 3,3 in positions5 and6. Hmm, those might come from the input row1's positions9 and10 (3,3). Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe when a 5 is present in any row, the output for that position is the value from the row above. So in Example1's row2's position1 has 5. The row above is row1's position1, which is 2. Output row2's position1 is 2. Then, row2's position7 has 5. Row1's position7 is 0. Output row2's position7 is 0. Then, the other elements in row2's output are taken from row2's input but removing the 5s. So input row2 is [0,5,0,0,0,0,0,5,3,0,0]. After replacing 5s with row1's values: [0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0]. Then, maybe adjacent zeros are merged. But the output row2 is [0,2,1,1,1,3,3,0,0]. Not matching.\n\nThis is getting really complicated. Let's try to think of a different approach. Maybe the pattern is that each 5 in any row is replaced by the sum of the elements in the same column from the other two rows. Let's test this:\n\nFor Example0's row0 position1 (5). Sum of row1 and row2: 2 (row1) + 0 (row2) =2. So output row0's position1 is 2. That matches. Row1's position3 (5): sum of row0 (0) + row2 (0) =0. Output row1's position3 is 1. Doesn't fit. Hmm. So maybe not.\n\nAnother idea: maybe each 5 in a row is replaced by the number of times a certain condition is met in the other rows. For example, the count of non-zero elements in the same column. In Example0's row0 position1 (5). The column has row0:5, row1:2, row2:0. Other rows (row1 and row2) have 2 and 0. Non-zero count is 1 (only row1's 2). So replaced by 1. But output row0's position1 is 2. Doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, the 5 is replaced by the sum of the other two elements in the column. For Example0's row0 position1: 2+0=2. Output is 2. That fits. Row1's position3 (5): row0's 0 + row2's 0 =0. Output is 1. Doesn't fit. So this works for some cases but not others.\n\nMaybe there's more to the pattern. Looking at Example0's output row1: [2,2,0,1,2,2,2]. The input row1 has 5s at positions3 and6. For position3: sum of other rows (0+0=0) \u2192 output 1. Doesn't fit. For position6: sum of other rows (0+0=0) \u2192 output 2. Also doesn't fit. So this can't be the only rule.\n\nLet's think of the outputs as being derived from some kind of cellular automaton-like rule, where each element in the output is determined by the elements around it in the input. But this would require figuring out the exact rule.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output rows are formed by combining elements from the input rows in a specific way when a 5 is present. For example, if a row has a 5, the corresponding position in the output takes the value from the row below, and the next position takes the value from the row above, or something like that.\n\nLet's look at Example2's input:\n\nInput rows:\n\nRow0: [0,0,0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,0]\nRow1: [2,2,2,0,5,8,8,0,0,0,0]\nRow2: [0,0,5,0,0,0,0,0,5,6,6]\n\nOutput:\n\nRow0: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\nRow1: [2,2,2,0,0,8,6,6,6]\nRow2: [0,0,2,8,8,8,0,0,0]\n\nIn row0's output, all zeros. Input row0 has a 5 at position6. Maybe when a 5 is in row0, the corresponding output elements are taken from row1's elements. So row0's 5 at position6: row1's position6 is8. But output row0 is all zeros. So that's not.\n\nIn row1's output: [2,2,2,0,0,8,6,6,6]. Input row1 has 5 at position4 and 8s at 5 and6. The output has 0,0,8,6, etc. Maybe the 5 in row1's position4 is replaced by something. Let's see: other rows at position4. Row0 has 0, row2 has 0. Sum is 0. So replaced by 0. So row1's position4 becomes 0. Then, the 8s remain. The output row1 has 8,6,6,6. The input row1's position6 is8, row2's position6 is0. Not sure.\n\nIn row2's output: [0,0,2,8,8,8,0,0,0]. The input row2 has 5s at positions2 and8. Position2's 5 is replaced by row1's position2 (2). So output row2's position2 is2. Then the 5 at position8 is replaced by row1's position8 (0). But output row2's position8 is0. Then, the other elements: input row2's positions5-7 are 0,0,5. After replacement, positions5-7 become 0,0,0. But output row2 has 8,8,8 in positions3-5. Where does that come from? Looking at row1's position5 is8 and position6 is8. Maybe the 8s are being propagated from row1's elements.\n\nThis is really tricky. Maybe the pattern involves replacing 5s with values from the row below, then merging certain elements. For example, in row0's 5 is replaced by row1's value, then consecutive identical numbers are merged.\n\nLet's try this for Example0:\n\nInput row0: [0,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0] \u2192 replace 5 with row1's position1 (2) \u2192 [0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]. Then merge consecutive duplicates: [0,2,0]. But output row0 is [0,2,1,1,0,0,0]. Doesn't match.\n\nAlternatively, after replacing 5s, any zeros are removed. So [0,2,0,0...] \u2192 [0,2], but output is longer.\n\nThis isn't working. Let's try to think of another approach.\n\nLooking at the output rows, some have elements that are lower than the input. For example, in Example0's row1 input has 5s replaced by 1 and 2. Maybe the 5s are being replaced by the minimum of the neighboring elements. For example, in row1's position3 (5), left neighbor is0, right is1. Minimum is0. But output is1. No.\n\nAlternatively, the product of neighbors. 0*1=0. Output is1. Doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, the difference. 1-0=1. Output is1. That fits for this case. For row1's position6 (5), neighbors are0 and2. 2-0=2. Output is2. That fits. What about Example0's row0's 5. Neighbors are0 and0. 0-0=0. Output is2. Doesn't fit. So this doesn't work.\n\nAnother idea: the output rows are the result of applying a specific transformation to each element based on its row and the presence of 5s. For example, when a 5 is found in a row, the corresponding output element is the sum of the elements in the same position from the other two rows. So for row0's 5 in Example0, sum of row1 and row2's position1: 2 +0=2. Output row0's position1 is2. Then, for row1's 5 in Example0's row1 position3: sum of row0 (0) and row2 (0) \u21920. But output is1. Doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. Let's try to look for another pattern in the outputs. For example, the output rows have the same number of elements as the input rows minus the number of 5s. Not sure. Example0's input row0 has one 5. Output row0 has 7 elements. Input row0 has 9 elements. 9-2=7. Not sure. Example1's input row0 has two 5s. Output row0 has 9 elements. Input row0 has 11 elements. 11-2=9. So maybe the output length is input length minus the number of 5s in that row. But in Example0's row0, output length is7, input is9, 9-1=8. No. So that's not.\n\nWait, Example0's output row0 has7 elements. Input row0's length is9. The output row0 has two 5s in the input? No, input row0 has one 5. So that theory is incorrect.\n\nAnother observation: in the output rows, there are sequences like 2,1,1 or 8,8,8. These could be expansions of certain values. For example, maybe each 5 in the input is replaced by a sequence based on adjacent elements. For instance, if a 5 is between 0 and1, it becomes 1 and1. But this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, each 5 is replaced by the previous and next elements. For example, in Example0's row1 position3 is5. Previous is0, next is1. So replaced by0 and1. But output row1's position3 is1, next element is2. Not matching.\n\nAlternatively, a 5 is replaced by the sum of the previous and next elements. For Example0's row1 position3:0+1=1. Output is1. Position6:0+2=2. Output is2. This works for row1's 5s. Then, what about row0's 5. Previous is0, next is0. Sum is0. Output row0's position1 is2. Doesn't fit.\n\nBut in row1's 5s, this works. So maybe the rule is: replace each 5 with the sum of its immediate left and right neighbors in the same row. Other elements remain the same. Then, the length of the output is the same as the input minus the number of 5s. For example, input row1 in Example0 has two 5s, so output length is9-2=7. Which matches the output row1's length of7. Let's check:\n\nExample0's row1 input: [2,2,0,5,1,0,5,2,2]. Two 5s. After replacing:\n\nPosition3 (5) replaced by0+1=1.\n\nPosition6 (5) replaced by0+2=2.\n\nSo new row1 becomes: [2,2,0,1,1,0,2,2,2]. Then remove the 5s. Wait, no. The length is still9, but the output has7 elements. So perhaps after replacing 5s with the sum, we remove the 5s and their adjacent elements. But that would reduce the length by3 per 5. For two 5s, 6 elements removed. Original length9, 9-6=3. Doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, after replacing 5s with their sum of neighbors, the resulting row is the output. But in Example0's row1, after replacement, the row is length9. Output is length7. So that doesn't fit.\n\nThis is really challenging. Let's try to think differently. Maybe the output rows are constructed by taking the input rows and for each 5, inserting the value from the row below at that position, and then removing the 5s. Then, merging consecutive duplicates.\n\nExample0's row0: [0,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]. Replace 5 with row1's position1 (2): [0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]. Merge consecutive duplicates: [0,2,0]. But output row0 is [0,2,1,1,0,0,0]. Doesn't match.\n\nAlternatively, replace 5s with the value from row below, then merge with adjacent elements. For example, row0 becomes [0,2,0,...], then combine with row1's elements.\n\nI'm stuck. Let's look at the test input and see if I can find a pattern there, maybe by applying possible transformations.\n\nTest input:\n\n[0,5,0,5,1,0,0,5,0,5,8]\n[2,2,0,0,1,0,5,3,0,0,8]\n[0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nDesired output: ?\n\nFollowing the pattern from training examples. Let's see.\n\nIn the output examples, the number of rows remains the same. Each input row is transformed into an output row. The output rows are shorter. For example, in Example0, input length9, output7. Test input rows have length11. So output rows should be shorter. Let's assume that each 5 in a row contributes to a reduction in length and certain replacements.\n\nLooking at Example0's output row0: the input row0 has one 5, output row0 is shorter by two. Example1's row0 has two 5s, output is shorter by two. Hmm, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, each 5 in the input causes certain elements to be added to the output. For example, each 5 in a row may result in two elements in the output. But this doesn't align with the examples.\n\nAlternatively, the output rows are constructed by replacing each 5 with a sequence derived from other rows. For instance, in Example3's output row0 has a 5 replaced by 1 and 2. Let's see: input row0 has 5 at position2. Output row0 after that 5 becomes 1, 2. But not sure.\n\nAnother Idea: Let's look for a pattern where each row in the output is a combination of the elements from the input rows, where 5s act as markers to start taking elements from another row. For example, when a 5 is encountered in row0, start taking elements from row1 until another 5 is found.\n\nBut let's test this with Example0:\n\nRow0 input: [0,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]. The 5 is at position1. So after that, take elements from row1 until another 5. Row1 elements from position1 onwards:2,0,5,1,0,5,2,2. So until the next 5 (position3 in row1), we take 2,0. Then, after that 5, take until next 5:1,0. Then after 5, take 2,2. But the output row0 is [0,2,1,1,0,0,0]. Doesn't match.\n\nAlternatively, the output row0 is formed by taking elements from row1 where row0 has 5. For Example0's row0, the 5 is at position1. So output row0 takes elements from row1 starting at position1: 2,0,5,1,0,5,2,2. But the output row0 has elements 2,1,1. So maybe 5s in row1 are skipped. Not sure.\n\nThis is taking too long. Maybe it's time to make a hypothesis based on the examples and apply it to the test input.\n\nLooking at the examples, it seems that whenever a row has a 5, the output for that row is influenced by the rows below or above. For example, in Example0's output row0, the 2 and 1s might come from row1's elements. The output rows are shorter than the input, which suggests that some elements are being merged or omitted.\n\nAnother possible pattern is that each 5 in a row is replaced by the value from the row below, and then consecutive elements are merged if they are the same. Let's try this:\n\nTest input row0: [0,5,0,5,1,0,0,5,0,5,8]\n\nRow0's 5s are at positions1,3,7,9.\n\nRow1's corresponding positions: positions1 is2,3 is0,7 is3,9 is0.\n\nSo replacing 5s with row1's values:\n\nRow0 becomes [0,2,0,0,1,0,0,3,0,0,8].\n\nNow, merging consecutive duplicates:\n\n0,2 (different), 0,0 (merge into 0), 1 (different),0,0 (merge into 0),3 (different),0,0 (merge into 0),8.\n\nSo merged: [0,2,0,1,0,3,0,8]. But this has 8 elements, which is shorter than the test input's length11. However, looking at the training examples, the output rows vary in how they are merged.\n\nBut the output rows in the examples aren't just merged duplicates. For example, in Example0's output row0 is [0,2,1,1,0,0,0], which has consecutive 1s and 0s, suggesting that merging is not based on duplicates.\n\nHmm. Maybe after replacing 5s, certain elements are appended from the row below or above. This is getting too speculative.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output rows are formed by a process where each 5 in a row is replaced by the value from the row below, and then the entire row is shifted left, removing zeros. But in Example0's row0, after replacement, there are zeros. Removing them would give [0,2], but output is longer.\n\nThis is really challenging. Given the time I've spent and not finding a clear pattern, I'll have to make an educated guess based on some observations.\n\nOne pattern I noticed is that in the output rows, whenever there's a 5 in the input, the corresponding position in the output is replaced by a value from the row below. For example:\n\n- Example0's row0 has a 5 at position1. Output row0's position1 is2, which matches row1's position1.\n\n- Example1's row2 has a 5 at position1. Output row2's position1 is2, which matches row1's position1.\n\n- Example2's row2 has a 5 at position2. Output row2's position2 is2, which matches row1's position2.\n\n- Example3's row0 has a 5 at position2. Output row0's position2 is1, which could be from row1's position2 (0) plus row2's position2 (0) doesn't fit. Wait, this doesn't align.\n\nBut perhaps when a 5 is in row i, the output for that position is taken from row i+1 (if exists), otherwise row i-1. For example:\n\nIn Example0's row0, 5 is replaced by row1's value. In row1's 5s, replaced by row2's values. In row2's 5s, since there's no row below, perhaps taken from row1.\n\nTesting this:\n\nExample0's row1 has 5s at positions3 and6. Row2's corresponding positions are0 and0. So output row1's positions3 and6 would be0 and0. But in the output row1, they are1 and2. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAnother possibility: when a 5 is present in row i, the output for that position is the sum of the values from the rows above and below. For example, in Example0's row0 position1: row1 (2) + row2 (0) =2. Output is2. In row1's position3: row0 (0) + row2 (0)=0. Output is1. Doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, product of rows above and below. 2*0=0. Output is1. No.\n\nThis is really tough. Given the time constraints, I think I'll have to make a guess based on the most consistent pattern I've observed: when a 5 is present in a row, it's replaced by the value from the row below, and the output is formed by merging certain elements. The lengths of the output rows are shorter, possibly due to the replacement of 5s and merging of elements.\n\nApplying this to the test input:\n\nTest input row0: [0,5,0,5,1,0,0,5,0,5,8]\n\nReplace each 5 with the value from row1's corresponding position:\n\n- Position1:5 \u2192 row1's position1 is2 \u2192 becomes2.\n\n- Position3:5 \u2192 row1's position3 is0 \u2192 becomes0.\n\n- Position7:5 \u2192 row1's position7 is3 \u2192 becomes3.\n\n- Position9:5 \u2192 row1's position9 is0 \u2192 becomes0.\n\nSo row0 becomes: [0,2,0,0,1,0,0,3,0,0,8].\n\nNow, merge adjacent elements in some way. Looking at the training examples, outputs often have sequences like 1,1 or 2,2,2, which might indicate that after replacement, consecutive elements are summed or merged if they are the same. For example, in Example0's output row0: [0,2,1,1,0,0,0]. The 1,1 could be from merging 0,1,0 in the replaced row.\n\nBut in the current test row0 after replacement, the sequence is [0,2,0,0,1,0,0,3,0,0,8]. If we merge consecutive zeros, it becomes [0,2,0,1,0,3,0,8]. Which has 8 elements, but the output examples have varying lengths. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe after replacing 5s, the elements are taken from the row below and above, leading to a shorter row.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is formed by taking every other element after replacing 5s. But this is just a guess.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and the complexity, I'll have to proceed with an educated guess based on the patterns I could find. Here's the final approach:\n\nEach 5 in a row is replaced by the sum of its left and right neighbors in the same row. Then, the row is processed to remove zeros or merge elements. For example, in Example0's row1:\n\n[2,2,0,5,1,0,5,2,2] \u2192 replace 5s with sum of left and right:\n\nAt position3:0+1=1.\n\nAt position6:0+2=2.\n\nNew row: [2,2,0,1,1,0,2,2,2]. Then, remove zeros: [2,2,1,1,2,2,2]. Which matches the output row1 [2,2,0,1,2,2,2] except for the zero. So this doesn't fit perfectly but partially.\n\nApplying this to the test input:\n\nTest row0: [0,5,0,5,1,0,0,5,0,5,8]\n\nReplace 5s with sum of left and right:\n\nPosition1:0 (left of 5 is0, right is0 \u21920+0=0). So replace with0.\n\nPosition3:0 (left is0, right is1 \u21920+1=1).\n\nPosition7:0 (left is0, right is0 \u21920+0=0).\n\nPosition9:8 (left is0, right is8 \u21920+8=8).\n\nSo row0 becomes: [0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,8,8].\n\nThen, perhaps merge consecutive zeros. So [0,0,0 \u21920], 1,1 \u21921, 0,0 \u21920, 0,0,8,8 \u21928,8. So output would be [0,1,0,8,8]. But this is shorter than expected. Not matching the example outputs' structure.\n\nAlternatively, after replacing 5s, the output is formed by taking elements from the modified row, but the process is unclear.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and the lack of a clear pattern, I'll have to make a best guess. Based on Example3's input and output, and others, it seems that 5s are replaced by values from the row below, then the resulting array is somehow transformed, possibly by merging adjacent elements when a 5 is replaced.\n\nApplying this to the test input:\n\nTest input row0: [0,5,0,5,1,0,0,5,0,5,8]\n\nReplace each 5 with row1's value:\n\nRow1's values at positions1,3,7,9 are2,0,3,0.\n\nSo row0 becomes: [0,2,0,0,1,0,0,3,0,0,8].\n\nNow, merge adjacent elements if they are the same. For example, 0,2,0,0 \u21920,2,0. But not sure. Or perhaps merge zeros.\n\nAlternatively, every time a 5 is replaced, the previous and next elements are also modified. This is getting too vague.\n\nGiven that I'm stuck, I'll proceed with the following output for the test input based on the hypothesis that 5s are replaced by the value from the row below and zeros are merged:\n\nRow0: [0,2,0,0,1,0,0,3,0,0,8] \u2192 after merging zeros and other transformations \u2192 [0,2,1,3,8]\n\nBut the examples have more elements. Alternatively, each replaced 5 introduces a new element.\n\nAlternatively, after replacing 5s, the output is formed by taking the first non-zero element from each column across the three rows.\n\nBut this is all guesswork. Given the time, I'll have to make a guess. Looking at the examples, the output rows seem to have elements from the rows below when a 5 is present, and some merging. The test output might be:\n\nRow0: [0,2,0,1,1,3,0,8]\nRow1: [2,2,0,1,0,3,8,8]\nRow2: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nBut this is just a guess. Based on Example3's output where row0 has elements from row1 after 5s, the test output row0 might be [0,2,0,0,1,3,0,8], but I'm not certain.\n\nAnother observation: the output rows seem to have their 5s replaced and some elements propagated from other rows. For the test input, applying this:\n\nTest input row0 has 5s at positions1,3,7,9.\n\nReplace each with row1's values: 2,0,3,0.\n\nSo row0 becomes [0,2,0,0,1,0,0,3,0,0,8]. Now, maybe merge elements between 5 replacements. For example, between positions1 and3 (2,0,0), merge into 2,0. But the output examples have more complex structures. It's unclear.\n\nGiven the time I've spent, I'll have to provide an answer based on the best pattern I can infer. Perhaps the output rows are formed by replacing each 5 with the sum of the two adjacent elements in the same row and then removing the 5s. Then, the length is reduced by the number of 5s. Let's test this for the test input:\n\nTest row0: [0,5,0,5,1,0,0,5,0,5,8]\n\nFor each 5:\n\nPosition1: left0, right0 \u21920+0=0.\n\nPosition3: left0, right1 \u21920+1=1.\n\nPosition7: left0, right0 \u21920+0=0.\n\nPosition9: left0, right8 \u21920+8=8.\n\nSo replacing 5s with these values, the new row0 becomes:\n\n[0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,8,8].\n\nThen, remove the 5s. But since they've been replaced, the row is now length11. But outputs are shorter. Maybe we remove the original positions where 5s were. For example, the original 5s were at positions1,3,7,9. So removing these positions:\n\nOriginal indices 0-10:\n\nAfter removing positions1,3,7,9: elements at indices0,2,4,5,6,8,10.\n\nValues:0,0,1,0,0,0,8 \u2192 [0,0,1,0,0,0,8]. But this doesn't match the examples' output structures.\n\nThis is very time-consuming and I'm not making progress. Based on the training examples, the output rows seem to involve replacing 5s with values from the row below and possibly other transformations, leading to shorter rows. For the test input, I'll try to construct the output rows by replacing each 5 with the corresponding value from the row below and then merging adjacent elements.\n\nTest input rows:\n\nRow0: [0,5,0,5,1,0,0,5,0,5,8]\nRow1: [2,2,0,0,1,0,5,3,0,0,8]\nRow2: [0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nProcessing each row:\n\nRow0: Replace 5s with row1's values at the same positions. So positions1,3,7,9:\n\n- position1: row1[1]=2 \u2192 becomes2.\n\n- position3: row1[3]=0 \u2192 becomes0.\n\n- position7: row1[7]=3 \u2192 becomes3.\n\n- position9: row1[9]=0 \u2192 becomes0.\n\nRow0 becomes: [0,2,0,0,1,0,0,3,0,0,8].\n\nNow, maybe merge consecutive zeros into a single zero. So:\n\n[0,2,0,1,0,3,0,0,8] \u2192 but the output examples don't always merge zeros. Not sure.\n\nRow1: Replace 5s with row2's values. Row1 has a 5 at position6. Row2[6]=0. So row1 becomes [2,2,0,0,1,0,0,3,0,0,8].\n\nRow2: Replace 5s with row below (but there's none, so maybe row1's value. Row2 has a 5 at position4. Row1[4]=1. So row2 becomes [0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0].\n\nNow, how to transform these into the output rows. The output examples often have elements from the row below where 5s were. For example, in Example0's output row0, after replacing 5 with row1's value, the output has elements from row1.\n\nBut I'm not sure. Given the time, I'll proceed to format the output based on this approach, even if it's not perfect.\n\nFinal guess for test output:\n\nRow0: [0,2,0,0,1,3,0,8] (after merging some elements)\n\nRow1: [2,2,0,0,1,0,3,0,8]\n\nRow2: [0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0]\n\nBut this doesn't match the example patterns. Alternatively, following Example0's output pattern where zeros are kept, but certain elements are added, the test output might be:\n\nRow0: [0,2,0,0,1,3,0,0,8]\n\nRow1: [2,2,0,0,1,0,3,0,8]\n\nRow2: [0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0]\n\nBut I'm not confident. Given the time constraints, I'll proceed to provide the answer in the specified format based on the best possible pattern I could deduce.",

        "cot_2": "Okay, let's tackle this puzzle. So, the task is to figure out the pattern that transforms the input lists into the output lists. Let me look at the training examples closely to understand what's going on.\n\nStarting with Example 0. The input has three rows. Let me compare input and output row by row.\n\nInput Row 0: [0,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\nOutput Row 0: [0,2,1,1,0,0,0]\nHmm, the output is shorter. The original row starts with 0, then 5. The output starts with 0, 2, 1,1... Maybe the 5 is being transformed into 2 and 1s? Not sure yet.\n\nLooking at the second input row: [2,2,0,5,1,0,5,2,2]\nOutput row: [2,2,0,1,2,2,2]\nSo here, the 5 and 1 might be converted. The original has 5,1, then another 5. The output between 0 and 2 is 1, then 2s. Maybe 5 and 1 are being replaced in a certain way.\n\nThird input row is all zeros except for a 5 in the middle. Output is all zeros. So 5 in the middle might be eliminated when certain conditions are met.\n\nExample 1: Input rows have various numbers. Let's check the outputs. The third output row in Example 1 is [0,2,1,1,1,3,3,0,0]. The input third row has 0,5,0,0,0,0,0,5,3,0,0. The output here starts with 0, then 2, then three 1s, followed by two 3s. So maybe when there's a 5, it's being replaced by a sequence of numbers increasing or something? But how?\n\nWait, maybe it's about the surrounding numbers. Like, when a 5 is in a row, it's replaced by the numbers from the adjacent rows. Let me check.\n\nIn Example 0's first input row, there's a 5 at index 1. The output row 0 becomes 0,2,1,1,0... Looking at the second row (input) in Example 0, the numbers are 2,2,0,5,1... So maybe the 5 in row 0 is replaced by the numbers from the row below (row 1) at the same position. Let's see:\n\nRow0 input has 5 at index1. Row1 at index1 is 2. But output row0 index1 is 2. Then next positions in output row0 are 1,1. Maybe when there's a 5 in a row, the cells below and above (from adjacent rows) are used to replace it. But how?\n\nAnother approach: Maybe each 5 in a row is replaced by the sum or combination of the elements from the rows above and below. Or perhaps the 5 acts as a placeholder that gets filled with values from adjacent rows. Let's look at Example0 again.\n\nIn Example0, the first input row is [0,5,0,...]. The output row0 starts with 0, then 2,1,1, then zeros. The 2 and 1s could be coming from the row below. The row below (row1) at index1 is 2. But in output row0, after 0, we have 2. Then the next elements in output are 1,1. Where do those come from? The row1 has at index3 a 5. Hmm, maybe the 5 in row0 is replaced by the elements from the row below, but perhaps shifted?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 5s are acting as markers to start a sequence that copies values from adjacent rows. For example, when a 5 is encountered in a row, the next elements are taken from the row below or above, but not sure.\n\nLooking at Example1's third output row: [0,2,1,1,1,3,3,0,0]. The input third row has 5s at index1 and 7. The output has 2 and 3 in those regions. The row above (input row2) is [2,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,3,3]. So maybe the 5 in row3 (third input row) at index1 is replaced by the value from row2 (second row) at that position, which is 2. Then maybe the following elements are filled with 1s until the next 5. Then the next 5 at index7 in input row3 is replaced by the value from row2's index7, which is 3. So the output would have 2 followed by 1s, then 3s.\n\nWait, let's check Example1's input row3:\n\nInput row3 (third row) is [0,5,0,0,0,0,0,5,3,0,0]. The output row3 is [0,2,1,1,1,3,3,0,0]. So the 5 at index1 is replaced by 2 (from row2's index1, which is 0?), no, wait row2 (second input row) is [2,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,3,3]. So index1 in row2 is 2. So maybe when there's a 5 in row3, the value is taken from row2's same index. Then, the following elements (if they are 0 in the original) are replaced by 1s until the next non-zero or a boundary? Or perhaps until another 5 is encountered.\n\nSo the 5 at index1 in input row3 is replaced by 2 (from row2), then the next zeros become 1s until another 5. Then the 5 at index7 is replaced by 3 (from row2's index7, which is 0? Wait, row2's index7 is 0. But the output row3 has a 3 there. Hmm, that doesn't fit. Wait, maybe the 5 in row3 is replaced by the value from row2's next position? Or maybe from the row above and below.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each 5 in a row is replaced by the sum or product of the elements from the rows above and below. Let's check.\n\nIn Example0's input row0: [0,5,0...]. The rows above and below for the 5 at index1: row1 at index1 is 2, and since row0 is the top row, maybe there's no row above. So maybe only the row below is considered. So 5 is replaced by 2. Then the following 0s are replaced by 1s. Wait, the output for row0 is [0,2,1,1,0,...]. So after the 2, there are two 1s. But why? The original input row0 after 5 is all zeros. Maybe the 5 is replaced by the value from the row below (2), then the next zeros are converted to 1s for a certain number of steps.\n\nIn Example1's third input row, the 5 at index1 is replaced by 2 (from row2 index1 which is 2), then the following zeros until the next 5 (at index7) become 1s. Then the 5 at index7 is replaced by the row2's index7, which is 0. But the output shows 3 there. Hmm, that doesn't fit. So maybe this approach is incorrect.\n\nWait, perhaps the 5s are replaced by values from the row below, but if the row below is a certain value. Let's look at Example1's third input row. The first 5 is at index1. The row below (row2) is index1 is 0. But in the output row3, it's 2. Hmm, that doesn't match. So maybe it's the row above?\n\nWait, row3 is the third row. The rows are:\n\nInput for Example1:\n\nRow1 (first input row): [0,0,0,5,1,5,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow2: [2,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,3,3]\n\nRow3: [0,5,0,0,0,0,0,5,3,0,0]\n\nOutput row3: [0,2,1,1,1,3,3,0,0]\n\nSo the 5 at index1 in row3 is replaced by 2. Where does 2 come from? Looking at row2 (the row above?), row2 at index1 is 2. So maybe when a 5 is in a row, replace it with the value from the row above at the same index. Then the following zeros (if any) are replaced by 1s until another non-zero in the original row. Let's check.\n\nIn Example1's row3 input: the first 5 is at index1. The row above (row2) at index1 is 2. So replace 5 with 2. Then the following zeros (indices 2-6) are replaced with 1s. Then the next 5 at index7 is replaced by row2's index7, which is 0. But the output here is 3. Hmm, that's not matching. Wait, row2's index7 is 0. But output has 3 here. So maybe that's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe when a 5 is in a row, the replacement value comes from the row below. Let's check. For Example1's row3, the row below would be non-existent, since it's the third row. Wait, in the input, each example has three rows. So rows are 0,1,2 perhaps. So row3 (third row) would have no rows below. So maybe for the 5 in row3, we take the row above (row2). Let's check: the first 5 in row3 is index1. Row2's index1 is 2. So replaced by 2. Then the following zeros become 1s. Then the next 5 in row3 is index7. Row2's index7 is 0. So replaced by 0, but the output has 3. So that doesn't fit.\n\nWait, perhaps the replacement comes from a different row. Let's check the other examples.\n\nLooking at Example2's input:\n\nInput row0: [0,0,0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,0]\n\nOutput row0: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nHmm, the 5 in input row0 is replaced by 0? But the output row0 is all zeros. So maybe when a 5 is in the top row (row0), it's replaced by 0. But in Example0's row0, the 5 is replaced by 2. So that can't be. So perhaps the approach isn't consistent here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 5s are being replaced by the sum or some operation of the adjacent cells in the same column. For example, in a 3-row system, each column's 5 is replaced by the sum of the other two elements in the column.\n\nIn Example0, input row0 has a 5 at index1. The column here would be row0:5, row1:2, row2:0. If we sum row1 and row2, 2+0=2. So replacing 5 with 2. Then in the output row0, index1 is 2. That fits. Then the following 0s in row0 are replaced by 1s? But why 1s?\n\nWait, after replacing the 5 with 2, maybe the next zeros are filled with 1s until the next non-zero element in the original row. In Example0's row0, after the 5, there are seven 0s. The output after 2 has 1,1,0,0,0. Wait, the output row0 is [0,2,1,1,0,0,0]. So after 2, there are two 1s, then 0s. But the original input row0 has more zeros. So maybe the 1s are only for a certain number of steps. Alternatively, perhaps the 5 is replaced by the sum, and then the next elements are filled with 1s until the next non-zero in the original row.\n\nIn Example0's input row0, after the 5, all are zeros. So maybe the 1s are added until the end of the row? But the output row0 is shorter. Wait, the input rows have varying lengths. For example, Example0's input rows are length 9, but output rows are length 7. How does the length change?\n\nLooking at Example0's input rows: all three rows have 9 elements. The output rows have 7 elements each. So the length is reduced. Maybe the 5s and their surrounding elements are being processed in a way that shortens the list.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is applied per row, and when a 5 is encountered, it's replaced by some values from adjacent rows, and then the list is compressed by removing certain elements.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 5s are acting as markers to start and stop copying from other rows. For example, when a 5 is found, copy elements from another row until another 5 is encountered, then stop. Then remove the 5s and adjust the list accordingly.\n\nBut let's take Example0's row1 input: [2,2,0,5,1,0,5,2,2]. Output row1 is [2,2,0,1,2,2,2]. The input has two 5s. The output between them is 1. So maybe between the 5s, elements are replaced. For instance, the 5 at index3 is followed by 1, 0, then 5. The output between the 5s becomes 1. But how?\n\nAlternatively, the 5s in row1 are replaced by the sum of the elements in the same column from the other rows. For example, the 5 in row1 index3: column is row0:0, row1:5, row2:0. So sum of other rows: 0+0=0. So replace 5 with 0. But output row1 index3 is 1. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe when a 5 is present in a row, the corresponding value from the row above is taken. In Example0's row1 index3 (5), the row above is row0's index3:0. So replace 5 with 0. But output is 1. So that's not matching.\n\nAnother angle: Let's look at how the output rows are structured. For Example0's output, the first row has 0,2,1,1,0... The 2 and 1s are where the original 5 was. The second output row has 2,2,0,1,2,2,2. The 1 is between two 5s in the input. The third row is all zeros.\n\nWait, maybe when there's a 5 in a row, it's replaced by the value from the row below. Then, any 0s following the 5 are replaced by 1s until the next non-zero in the original row. For example, in Example0's first input row (row0): 5 is at index1. The row below (row1) at index1 is 2. So replaced by 2. Then the following zeros in row0 become 1s until the next non-zero (which is none, but in the output they only have two 1s). Maybe the number of 1s depends on the distance to the next 5 or another non-zero.\n\nBut Example0's row0 input after the 5 is all zeros, but output has two 1s. Then why two?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps when a 5 is replaced, the next two elements (even if they are zeros) are replaced with 1s. But in Example1's output row3, after the 2, there are three 1s. So that might not fit.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 5 is replaced by the value from the row below, and then each subsequent 0 is replaced by 1 until the next 5 or a non-zero element. So in Example0's row0, after the 5 (replaced by 2), the next zeros are replaced by 1s until the end of the row, but the output cuts it off after two 1s. But why? Maybe the output length is determined by some other rule.\n\nAlternatively, the output length is the original length minus the number of 5s multiplied by something. For Example0's input row0 has one 5. Original length is 9. Output length is 7. 9-1*2=7. So perhaps each 5 reduces the length by 2. Let's check Example1's input rows. Example1's first input row has two 5s. Output row0 in Example1 has length 9. Wait, input length is 11 for Example1's rows. Output rows are 9, 9, 9. Hmm, not sure.\n\nWait, looking at Example0's input rows: three rows, each of length 9. Outputs are three rows of length7.\n\nExample1's input rows are length11. Outputs are length9.\n\nExample2's input rows are length11. Outputs are length9.\n\nExample3's input rows are length11. Outputs are length8.\n\nSo for the input lengths:\n\nIf original row length is N, output row length is N - 2*number_of_5s.\n\nWait, Example0's row0 has one 5. 9-2*1=7. Correct.\n\nExample1's row0 has two 5s. 11-2*2=7. But output row0 length is 9. So that doesn't fit. So maybe that's not the pattern.\n\nAlternative approach: Let's look at the positions of 5s in each input row and see how they are transformed.\n\nTake Example0's input row0: [0,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nThe 5 is at index1. Output row0 is [0,2,1,1,0,0,0]. So the 5 is replaced by 2, then two 1s, and the rest zeros. But the output is shorter.\n\nExample0's input row1: [2,2,0,5,1,0,5,2,2]\n\nTwo 5s at indices3 and6. Output row1 is [2,2,0,1,2,2,2]. So between the two 5s, the 1 and 0 are replaced by 1 and 2s? Or the 5s are replaced by 1 and 2.\n\nAlternatively, each 5 is replaced by a 1, and the following elements are adjusted. But that doesn't seem to fit.\n\nAnother idea: Each 5 in a row is replaced by the value from the row below, and each 5 in the last row is replaced by 0. Also, the zeros following a 5 are replaced by 1s up to the next non-zero or for a certain number of steps. Then, after processing, the list is truncated.\n\nWait, in Example0's row0, the 5 is replaced by 2 (from row1 index1). Then the following zeros are replaced by 1s. The output row0 has 0,2,1,1,0,0,0. The zeros after the two 1s might be because the original row0 after index1 had a bunch of zeros, but the output stops earlier. Maybe after replacement, the list is truncated by removing the trailing zeros. But in Example0's output row0, there are three trailing zeros. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, when a 5 is replaced, the next two elements are set to 1s. For Example0's row0, after 2 (replaced 5), two 1s are added. Then the rest are zeros. The original row0 after 5 is seven zeros. Output has two 1s followed by zeros, but the output length is shorter. Hmm.\n\nWait, the output rows are shorter. How are the elements being removed? Let's see:\n\nExample0's input row0 is length9. Output row0 is length7. The input row1 is length9, output is length7. So in row0, two elements are removed. The input has one 5. So perhaps for each 5, two elements are removed. 9 - 2*1 =7.\n\nExample1's input rows are length11. Output rows are length9. So 11-2=9. But Example1's row0 has two 5s, so 11 - 2*2=7. But output length is 9. So this doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. So maybe the length reduction isn't directly related to the number of 5s.\n\nAlternative approach: Let's look for other patterns. Maybe when a 5 is present in a row, certain transformations are applied to neighboring elements. For example, the 5 might act as a \"bridge\" that transfers values from one row to another.\n\nLooking at Example3's input:\n\nInput row0: [0,1,5,0,0,0,0,0,2,2,0]\n\nOutput row0: [0,1,1,2,2,0,2,2]\n\nSo the 5 in input row0 is replaced by 1. Then following zeros become 2, etc. The row below (row1) has [1,1,0,0,5,2,0,5,2,0,0]. So maybe the 5 in row0 is replaced by the value from the row below (row1) at the same index. In row1, index2 is 0, so replaced by 0. But output row0's index2 is 1. Hmm, not matching.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 5 is replaced by the sum of adjacent elements in the same column. For example, in row0's 5 (index2), sum the elements from row1 and row2. Row1 index2 is 0, row2 index2 is 0. Sum is 0. So replaced by 0, but output has 1. Doesn't fit.\n\nAnother observation: Looking at the outputs, the numbers are often 0,1,2,3, etc. So perhaps the 5s are being replaced by numbers from adjacent rows, and then the 0s following are converted to 1s until a certain condition.\n\nLet me try to see for each 5 in the input, what is the corresponding value in the output.\n\nIn Example0's row0 input: 5 \u2192 output is 2.\n\nRow1 input: 5 at index3 \u2192 output is 1.\n\nRow1 input: 5 at index6 \u2192 output is 2.\n\nExample1's row3 input: 5 at index1 \u2192 output is 2.\n\n5 at index7 \u2192 output is 3.\n\nExample2's row0 input: 5 at index6 \u2192 output is 0.\n\nRow1 input:5 at index4 \u2192 output is 0.\n\nRow2 input:5 at index2 \u2192 output is 2.\n\nExample3's row0 input:5 at index2 \u2192 output is 1.\n\nRow1 input:5 at index4 \u2192 output is 2.\n\nRow1 input:5 at index7 \u2192 output is 2.\n\nLooking for a pattern here. Let's see:\n\nFor Example0's row0: 5 is replaced by 2. The row below (row1) at that index is 2.\n\nRow1's 5 at index3: row below (row2) at index3 is 0. But output is 1. Hmm, not matching.\n\nWait, perhaps the replacement is from the row above. For Example0's row1's 5 at index3: row above is row0's index3, which is 0. But output is 1. No.\n\nAnother possibility: maybe the replacement is the sum of the elements from the rows above and below.\n\nExample0 row0's 5: row above doesn't exist (since it's the top row), so maybe just the row below. Row1's index1 is 2. So 2. Which matches the output.\n\nRow1's 5 at index3: row above (row0 index3) is 0, row below (row2 index3) is 0. Sum is 0. But output is 1. Doesn't fit.\n\nRow1's 5 at index6: row0 index6 is 0, row2 index6 is 0. Sum is 0. Output is 2. So no.\n\nHmm. This approach isn't working.\n\nAlternative idea: Maybe each 5 is replaced by the maximum of the adjacent cells in the same column. Let's check.\n\nExample0 row0's 5: max(row1 index1=2) \u2192 2. Output is 2. Correct.\n\nRow1 index3: row0 index3=0, row2 index3=0. Max is 0. Output is 1. Not correct.\n\nHmm. Not matching.\n\nAlternative approach: Let's consider that each 5 in a row is replaced by the value from the row below, but if the row below is not present (like in the last row), then use the row above. Let's test this.\n\nExample0's row0 5: row below (row1 index1=2). So 2. Correct.\n\nExample1's row3 5 at index1: row below doesn't exist, so row2 (index1=2). Output is 2. Correct.\n\nExample1's row3 5 at index7: row below doesn't exist, so row2 index7=0. But output is 3. So that's not matching. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe for the middle row (row1), the replacement comes from both rows above and below.\n\nBut Example0 row1's 5 at index3: row0 index3=0, row2 index3=0. Some operation on these. But output is 1.\n\nNot sure.\n\nWait, maybe the replacement value is the sum of the non-zero values from the other rows in the same column. For Example0 row0's 5: column has 0 (row0),5 (row0),0 (row2). Wait, other rows: row1 index1=2, row2 index1=0. Sum of non-zero is 2. So replaced by 2.\n\nExample0 row1's 5 at index3: column has row0's 0, row1's5, row2's0. Sum of non-zero other rows (row0 and row2) is 0. So replaced by 0. But output is 1. Doesn't fit.\n\nAlternative idea: Maybe each 5 is replaced by the number of non-zero elements in the same column. For Example0 row0's 5: column has row0's 5, row1's2, row2's0. Non-zero in other rows: row1's2. So count is 1. But output is 2. Not matching.\n\nHmm. This is tricky. Let's try to look for a different pattern.\n\nLooking at Example0's output row0: [0,2,1,1,0,0,0]. The input row0 had a 5 at index1. The output starts with 0, then 2, followed by two 1s. The output row0's length is 7, which is two less than the input's 9. So perhaps the 5 and the next element are removed and replaced with 2, then followed by two 1s. But why?\n\nAlternatively, when a 5 is encountered, it's replaced by the value from the row below, then the next two elements are replaced by 1s, and then the rest follow.\n\nBut in Example0's row0, after the 5, there are seven 0s. The output replaces the 5 with 2, then two 1s, then the rest zeros. So the output length is reduced by two (original 9 \u21927). So maybe each 5 causes two elements to be removed. But in Example0, there's one 5, so two elements removed. Original 9 \u21929-2=7. Yes. So if the input has k 5s, then the output length is N - 2k.\n\nLet's check other examples.\n\nExample1's first input row: [0,0,0,5,1,5,0,0,0,0,0] \u2192 two 5s. So output length should be 11-2*2=7. But the output row0 for Example1 is [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0], which is length9. So that's 11-2*2=7, but output is 9. Doesn't fit. So this theory is invalid.\n\nHmm. Maybe the number of 5s isn't the only factor.\n\nAlternative approach: Maybe the output is generated by processing each row and for each 5, inserting some values from adjacent rows and removing the 5s.\n\nLet's look at Example0's row0 again. Input has 5 at index1. Output becomes [0,2,1,1,0,0,0]. So perhaps the 5 is replaced by 2 (from row1) and then the next two elements are 1s. Then the rest are kept as zeros but the list is truncated. So after replacement, the list is cut shorter. But why the truncation?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps when a 5 is replaced, the next two elements are filled with 1s, and then any elements after that are shifted left, causing the overall length to reduce. For example, replacing a single 5 with three elements (2,1,1), but that would increase the length. But in Example0's output row0 is shorter than the input, so that can't be.\n\nAlternatively, when a 5 is encountered, it's removed along with the next element, and replaced by the value from the row below. But Example0's output row0 has 0,2,1,1,... So original elements before 5 are kept, 5 is replaced by 2, then some 1s, and possibly the rest are shifted.\n\nThis is getting too convoluted. Let's try to find a different angle.\n\nLooking at Example2's output:\n\nInput row0: [0,0,0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,0]\n\nOutput row0: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nSo the 5 in row0 is replaced by 0. The output row0 is all zeros. So why is the 5 replaced by 0 here? Maybe because it's the top row, so there's no row below to pull from, so 0.\n\nIn Example0's row0, the 5 is replaced by 2 from row1. So when a row is not the bottom row, 5s are replaced by the value from the row below. If it's the bottom row, 5s are replaced by the value from the row above, or zero.\n\nBut in Example2's input row0 is the top row. The 5 is replaced by 0.\n\nIn Example3's input row0 has a 5. Output row0's third element is 1. The row below (row1) at that position is 0. So why 1? Hmm, maybe this approach isn't correct.\n\nAlternatively, the replacement for a 5 depends on the row's position. For example:\n\n- If the row is the top row (row0), replace 5 with the value from the row below (row1) in the same column.\n\n- If the row is the middle row (row1), replace 5 with the sum of row0 and row2 in the same column.\n\n- If the row is the bottom row (row2), replace 5 with the value from the row above (row1) in the same column.\n\nLet's test this.\n\nExample0 row0 (top row), 5 at index1: row1's index1 is 2. So replaced by 2. Correct.\n\nExample0 row1 (middle row), 5 at index3: row0's index3 is 0, row2's index3 is 0. Sum is 0. But output is 1. Not correct.\n\nExample1 row3 (bottom row), 5 at index1: row2's index1 is 2. So replaced by 2. Correct. The next 5 in row3 (index7) would be replaced by row2's index7, which is 0. But output has 3 there. So no.\n\nHmm. Doesn't fit.\n\nAnother idea: When a 5 is in a row, look at the row below (if exists) and the row above (if exists). If there's a non-zero value in either, use that. Otherwise, use 0.\n\nExample0 row0's 5: row below has 2 \u2192 use 2.\n\nExample0 row1's 5 at index3: row above (0) and row below (0) \u2192 use 0. But output is 1. So no.\n\nThis is frustrating. Let's try to look at the output sequences and see if they relate to the inputs in a different way.\n\nExample0's output row0: [0,2,1,1,0,0,0]\n\nInput row0: [0,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nMaybe the 5 is replaced by 2 and 1s. Where does 2 come from? The row below's same index is 2. Then, each subsequent zero is replaced by 1 until a certain point. Maybe until the next non-zero in the original row. But in this case, the original row has zeros after 5. So why two 1s?\n\nAlternatively, the number of 1s is determined by the value of the replacement. For example, 2 \u2192 two 1s. But why?\n\nIn Example1's row3 output, the replacement after 2 is three 1s. So if the replacement value is 2, then two 1s. But in Example1's output, after 2, there are three 1s. So that theory doesn't fit.\n\nAnother approach: Maybe each 5 in the input row is replaced by the sum of the non-zero elements in the same column from the other rows. Let's check.\n\nExample0 row0's 5 at index1: row1's index1 is 2, row2's index1 is 0. Sum is 2. Correct.\n\nExample0 row1's 5 at index3: row0's index3 is 0, row2's index3 is 0. Sum is 0. But output is 1. No.\n\nHmm.\n\nExample1's row3 input: 5 at index1. row2's index1 is 0. row0's index1 is 0. Sum is 0. But output is 2. So that's not it.\n\nAlternative idea: Each 5 is replaced by the number of non-zero elements in the same column. Let's see.\n\nExample0 row0's 5: column has row1=2 (non-zero), row2=0. So count is 1. Output is 2. No.\n\nNo.\n\nThis is really challenging. Let's look at Example3's input and output.\n\nExample3's input row0: [0,1,5,0,0,0,0,0,2,2,0]\n\nOutput row0: [0,1,1,2,2,0,2,2]\n\nThe 5 is replaced by 1. Where does this 1 come from?\n\nRow below (row1) index2 is 0. Row above: no row. So perhaps when in the top row, the 5 is replaced by the value from the row below. In this case, row1's index2 is 0. So why replaced by 1?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the replacement is from the next non-zero element in the same row. But the input row0 after 5 is all zeros except for 2,2 at the end.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 5 is replaced by the previous element in the same row. In row0, before 5 is 1. So replace 5 with 1, then the following zeros are replaced by the next elements. But output row0 after 1 is 1, then 2,2. So maybe the 5 is replaced by the previous element (1), then the following zeros are replaced by the next elements in the row below.\n\nBut this is getting too vague.\n\nAnother observation: In Example0's output row1, the two 5s are replaced by 1 and 2. Let's look at the input row1: [2,2,0,5,1,0,5,2,2]. The output is [2,2,0,1,2,2,2].\n\nSo between the two 5s (indices3 and6), there's a 1 and 0. The output here is 1,2,2. So the first 5 is replaced by 1, the second by 2. How?\n\nThe row below row1 (row2) for index3 is 0, and row above (row0) index3 is 0. So where does 1 come from?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 5s are replaced by the previous non-zero element in the same row. For example, in input row1, before the 5 at index3, the previous elements are 2,2,0. The last non-zero is 2. So replace 5 with 2. But output is 1. Doesn't fit.\n\nAnother idea: The number of 1s in the output seems related to the number of 5s and their positions. Maybe each 5 in a row is replaced by a certain value, and the following 0s are replaced by 1s until the next 5 or non-zero.\n\nIn Example0's row0: after replacing 5 with 2, the zeros become 1s until the next non-zero (none), but the output only has two 1s. Maybe there's a limit of two 1s per 5.\n\nIn Example1's row3: after replacing 5 with 2, three 1s are added before the next 5. Then that 5 is replaced by 3, and two 3s are added.\n\nBut how to determine how many 1s are added? It seems inconsistent.\n\nAlternatively, when a 5 is replaced, the number of 1s added is equal to the replacement value. For example, in Example0 row0, replacement is 2, so two 1s. In Example1 row3, replacement is 2, so three 1s. Doesn't fit.\n\nHmm.\n\nAt this point, perhaps I should try to find a pattern for each example and see if there's a common rule.\n\nLooking at Example0's output:\n\nRow0: 5 replaced by 2, followed by two 1s.\n\nRow1: two 5s replaced by 1 and 2.\n\nRow2: all zeros.\n\nExample1's output:\n\nRow3: two 5s replaced by 2 and 3, with three 1s between them.\n\nExample2's output:\n\nRow0: 5 replaced by 0.\n\nRow1: 5 replaced by 0.\n\nRow2: 5 replaced by 2, followed by three 8s.\n\nExample3's output:\n\nRow0: 5 replaced by 1, followed by two 2s.\n\nRow1: 5s replaced by 2s.\n\nRow2: all zeros.\n\nAnother observation: The replacement value for a 5 might be the next non-zero element in the row below. For example, in Example0 row0's 5, the row below (row1) at index1 is 2. So replacement is 2. Then, the next elements in row1 after index1 are 2,0,5, etc. But how does that translate to the 1s?\n\nAlternatively, after replacing a 5 with a value from the row below, the following zeros in the current row are replaced by 1s until the next non-zero element in the row below. For example, in Example0 row0:\n\n5 is replaced by 2 (row1 index1). The next elements in row1 after index1 are 2,0,5,1,0,5, etc. So maybe the 0s in row0 are replaced by 1s until row1 has a non-zero. Let's see:\n\nAfter replacing 5 with 2, the next zeros in row0 are replaced by 1s until row1's corresponding positions have a non-zero. Row1's index2 is 0, index3 is5. So maybe until index3. So the zeros at indices2 and3 in row0 are replaced by 1s. But the output row0 is [0,2,1,1,0,0,0]. So indices2 and3 are 1s. That fits. Because row1's index3 is 5 (non-zero). So two 1s are added. Then after that, row1's index4 is 1 (non-zero), so the zeros in row0 are not replaced. But the output row0 has zeros after the two 1s. So maybe the rule is: after replacing the 5 with the value from the row below, replace subsequent zeros in the current row with 1s until the row below has a non-zero in the next position. Then stop.\n\nLet's test this:\n\nExample0 row0:\n\nAfter replacing 5 (index1) with 2, look at row1's next positions. Index2 is 0 (row1's index2 is 0), so replace the next zero (index2) with 1. Then check row1's index3:5 (non-zero). So replace index3 with 1 and stop. So row0's indices2 and3 become 1s, and the rest remain zeros. Which matches the output.\n\nExample1's row3 input: [0,5,0,0,0,0,0,5,3,0,0]\n\nOutput: [0,2,1,1,1,3,3,0,0]\n\nFirst 5 at index1: replaced by row2's index1, which is 2. Then, zeros in row3 after index1 are replaced with 1s until row2's next non-zero. Let's see:\n\nRow2 is [2,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,3,3].\n\nAfter replacing 5 at index1 with 2, next zeros in row3 are indices2-6. For each zero, check row2's corresponding index:\n\nindex2 in row2 is 0 \u2192 replace with 1.\n\nindex3 in row2 is 0 \u2192 replace with 1.\n\nindex4 in row2 is 0 \u2192 replace with 1.\n\nindex5 in row2 is 0 \u2192 replace with 1.\n\nindex6 in row2 is 0 \u2192 replace with 1.\n\nWait, but the output has three 1s after 2. So why three?\n\nIn row3's output after 2, there are three 1s. Let's see:\n\nThe next 5 in row3 is at index7. So after the first 5 (index1) is replaced by 2, the zeros from index2 to index6 are candidates. But row2's indices 2-6 are all zeros. So according to the previous logic, all these zeros in row3 would be replaced by 1s. But the output only has three 1s. So maybe the replacement stops at the next 5 in the original row. In row3's input, the next 5 is at index7. So between index1 and7, there are zeros. So replace all zeros until the next 5 with 1s. So from index2 to6 (5 zeros), replaced by 1s. But in the output, there are three 1s. Hmm, this doesn't align. \n\nWait, the output for Example1's row3 is [0,2,1,1,1,3,3,0,0]. The three 1s are at indices2,3,4. Then indices5 and6 are 3s. But the original row3 has a 5 at index7. So perhaps after replacing the first 5, the zeros are replaced by 1s until the next 5 (at index7), but the output has three 1s. So from index2 to index6 (indices 2,3,4,5,6), which is five zeros. But the output only has three 1s. So this theory doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the replacement of zeros with 1s stops when a non-zero is encountered in the current row. But in Example1's row3 input, after the first 5, there are zeros until the next 5. So all those zeros would be replaced by 1s. But the output only has three 1s. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAnother possibility: The number of 1s is determined by the distance between the 5s. In Example1's row3, the two 5s are at indices1 and7. The distance is6. But the output has three 1s between them. So not directly related.\n\nAt this point, I'm struggling to find a clear pattern. Let's summarize what I've noticed:\n\n- 5s in a row are replaced by values from other rows (possibly row below for top row, row above for bottom row, and some combination for middle row).\n\n- Zeros following a replaced 5 are converted into 1s until a certain condition (like a non-zero in another row or the same row).\n\n- The length of the output row is shorter than the input row, possibly due to removal of elements after processing.\n\nBut without a clear pattern, it's challenging. Let's try to apply this to the test input and see if I can find a pattern.\n\nTest Input:\n\nRow0: [0,5,0,5,1,0,0,5,0,5,8]\n\nRow1: [2,2,0,0,1,0,5,3,0,0,8]\n\nRow2: [0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nExpected output: Need to apply the pattern.\n\nAssuming that each 5 is replaced by the value from the row below (for row0) or row above (for row2), and zeros after are replaced by 1s until the next non-zero in the other row.\n\nLet's process each row of the test input.\n\nRow0: [0,5,0,5,1,0,0,5,0,5,8]\n\nSince it's the top row, replace each 5 with the value from row1 (below) at the same index.\n\nRow1 is [2,2,0,0,1,0,5,3,0,0,8].\n\nRow0's 5s are at indices1,3,7,9.\n\nFor each 5 in row0:\n\nIndex1: row1's index1 is 2 \u2192 replace with 2.\n\nIndex3: row1's index3 is 0 \u2192 replace with 0.\n\nIndex7: row1's index7 is 3 \u2192 replace with 3.\n\nIndex9: row1's index9 is 0 \u2192 replace with 0.\n\nNow, after replacing 5s, the zeros following each replaced 5 are replaced by 1s until the next non-zero in row1.\n\nProcessing row0:\n\nOriginal row0 after replacements becomes:\n\n[0,2,0,0,1,0,0,3,0,0,8]\n\nBut need to replace the zeros after each replaced 5 with 1s until the next non-zero in row1.\n\nLet's step through:\n\n- At index1: replaced with 2. Now, next elements are 0 (index2), 5 (original) but replaced with 0 (index3), then 1, etc.\n\nWait, the original row0 has 5s at indices1,3,7,9. After replacement:\n\n[0,2,0,0,1,0,0,3,0,0,8]\n\nWait no, because the other elements (non-5) remain as is. So after replacing the 5s:\n\nIndices:\n\n0:0\n\n1:2 (replaced 5)\n\n2:0\n\n3:0 (replaced 5)\n\n4:1\n\n5:0\n\n6:0\n\n7:3 (replaced 5)\n\n8:0\n\n9:0 (replaced 5)\n\n10:8\n\nNow, for each replaced 5, we need to replace the subsequent zeros with 1s until the row1 has a non-zero.\n\nLet's process each replaced 5:\n\nFirst replaced 5 at index1 (2):\n\nThe next zero in row0 is index2. Check row1's index2:0 \u2192 replace with 1.\n\nThen index3 in row0 was replaced from 5 to 0 (row1's index3 is 0). So next zero is index4 (original 1, so no). Wait, this is getting confusing.\n\nAlternatively, after replacing each 5 with the value from row1, look at the subsequent zeros in row0 and replace them with 1s until row1 has a non-zero in that position.\n\nProcessing row0:\n\nStarting from index1: replaced with 2.\n\nNext positions: index2 (0 in row0). Check row1's index2:0 \u2192 replace with 1. Then index3 (replaced from 5 to 0) \u2192 row1's index3 is 0 \u2192 replace with 1. Next index4 in row0 is 1 (original), so stop. So between index1 and4, we have 2, 1, 1, 1.\n\nWait, but row0's index4 is 1 (original), so after index3 (replaced to 0 \u2192 but then replaced to 1), then index4 is 1. So the sequence from index1 is 2, 1, 1, 1.\n\nNext replaced 5 is at index3 (now replaced to 0, but according to row1's index3 is 0. So maybe this 0 is replaced by 1? Or does this depend on the row below?\n\nI'm getting stuck here. Let's try to proceed step by step.\n\nFor each replaced 5 in row0:\n\n1. Index1: replaced with 2 (from row1 index1=2). Then, the next zeros in row0 (indices2,3) are replaced with 1s until row1's corresponding indices are non-zero.\n\nRow1 indices2 and3 are 0 and 0. So replace those zeros in row0 with 1s. So after index1, indices2 and3 become 1s. Then index4 in row0 is 1 (original), so stop. So now, row0 up to index4 is [0,2,1,1,1].\n\nNext replaced 5 is at index3 (original 5 replaced to 0). But after processing index1, index3 was already replaced to 1. So this may have been processed already. Hmm, this approach is getting complicated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each 5 is processed sequentially, and after processing a 5, the subsequent elements are scanned for zeros to replace.\n\nBut given the time I've spent without a clear pattern, I'll proceed to hypothesize the output for the test input based on observed patterns in the training examples.\n\nLooking at the test input's row0:\n\n[0,5,0,5,1,0,0,5,0,5,8]\n\nAfter replacing 5s with values from row1:\n\n- index1: 2 (from row1's index1)\n- index3: 0 (row1's index3)\n- index7:3 (row1's index7)\n- index9:0 (row1's index9)\n\nThen, after each replacement, the subsequent zeros are replaced by 1s until the next non-zero in row1.\n\nFor example, after index1 (2), the next elements are 0 (index2) and 5 (index3, replaced to 0). Row1's index2 is 0 \u2192 replace with 1. Row1's index3 is 0 \u2192 replace with 1. Next row1's index4 is 1 \u2192 stop. So indices2 and3 become 1s. So row0 becomes [0,2,1,1,1, ...].\n\nThen at index3 (replaced to 0), but row1's index3 is 0 \u2192 replace with 1. But this might have already been processed.\n\nFor index7 replaced to 3: next zeros in row0 are indices8 and9. Check row1's indices8 and9:0 and0 \u2192 replace with 1s until row1 has non-zero. But row1's index10 is 8 \u2192 which is non-zero. So from index8 to9: replace zeros with 1s. But row0's index9 was replaced to 0 (from 5). So indices8 and9 become 1s.\n\nFinally, index9 replaced to 0: row1's index9 is0 \u2192 replace with1. Next is index10 (8), so no replacement.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nRow0 after processing:\n\n[0,2,1,1,1,0,0,3,1,1,8]\n\nBut the output length is shorter. How?\n\nIn training examples, the output rows are shorter than input rows. For example, in Example0, input length9 \u2192 output7. Each 5 reduces the length by 2.\n\nTest input row0 has four 5s. Original length11. 11 -4*2=3. So output length3. But this doesn't make sense. So this theory is invalid.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output length is the input length minus the number of 5s. 11-4=7. But the output rows in the examples don't fit this either.\n\nAlternatively, each 5 and the following element are removed. For example, in Example0's row0, one 5, remove two elements (5 and one zero). But the output length is 7 (9-2=7). So four 5s \u2192 11-2*4=3. But that seems unlikely.\n\nThis is really challenging. Given the time I've spent, I'll try to make an educated guess based on the examples.\n\nLooking at the test input row2: [0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nSince it's the bottom row, 5s are replaced by values from the row above (row1). Row1's index4 is1. So replace 5 with1. Then zeros after are replaced by 1s until row1's next non-zero. Row1's index5 is0, index6 is5 \u2192 non-zero. So replace zeros from index5 to5 (only index5). So output for row2 would be [0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0]. But length is shortened somehow.\n\nBut the actual output needs to be shorter. I'm not sure.\n\nGiven that I'm time-constrained, I'll proceed to make a guess for the test input output.\n\nBased on Example0's pattern, where each 5 is replaced by the row below's value and zeros become 1s until the next non-zero in the row below:\n\nTest input row0:\n\n5s at indices1,3,7,9.\n\nReplace each with row1's values:\n\n- index1:2\n\n- index3:0\n\n- index7:3\n\n- index9:0\n\nThen replace subsequent zeros with 1s until row1 has a non-zero.\n\nFor index1's 2:\n\nNext elements (indices2,3,4...):\n\nRow1's indices2:0 \u2192 1.\n\nRow1's index3:0 \u21921.\n\nRow1's index4:1 \u2192 stop. So indices2 and3 become 1s.\n\nSo after index1: 2,1,1.\n\nNext, index3 was a 5 replaced to 0. But after processing index1, index3 is now 1. So this 5 may have been processed.\n\nFor index3's 5 (now replaced to 0), but after processing, it's part of the previous sequence.\n\nThen, index4 is 1 (original), so no change.\n\nNext 5 at index7 (replaced to3):\n\nSubsequent zeros (indices8,9):\n\nRow1's index8:0 \u21921.\n\nRow1's index9:0 \u21921.\n\nRow1's index10:8 \u2192 stop. So indices8 and9 become1,1.\n\nFinally, index9's 5 was replaced to0. But after processing index7, index9 is part of the sequence.\n\nSo row0 becomes:\n\n[0,2,1,1,1,0,0,3,1,1,8]\n\nBut need to shorten it. Maybe trailing zeros are removed. Or the length is adjusted based on the number of 5s.\n\nBut the training examples don't show trailing zeros being removed. For example, Example0's row0 output has trailing zeros.\n\nSo perhaps the output row0 would be [0,2,1,1,1,0,0,3,1,1,8], but this is length11, which is the same as input. But training examples have shorter outputs. So perhaps there's a different shortening mechanism.\n\nAlternatively, each 5 and the next element are removed and replaced by the replacement value and 1s. For example, each 5 takes two positions. So four 5s would reduce the length by 8, but 11-8=3. Unlikely.\n\nAt this point, I'm unable to determine the exact pattern. Based on Example3's output where 5s are replaced by 1 and followed by 2s, I'll make an educated guess that the test input's output is:\n\nRow0: [0,2,1,1,1,0,3,1,1,8]\n\nRow1: [2,2,0,0,1,5,3,0,0,8]\n\nRow2: [0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0]\n\nBut I'm not confident. Given the time I've spent, I'll provide the following answer based on the patterns I could discern."
