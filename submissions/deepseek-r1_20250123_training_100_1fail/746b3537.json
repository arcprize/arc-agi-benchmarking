        "cot_1": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. So, looking at the training examples, each input is a list of lists, and the output is another list of lists. Let's go through each example one by one.\n\nStarting with Example 0:\nInput has three rows: [1,1,1], [2,2,2], [1,1,1]. The output is [1], [2], [1]. So each row in the output is the first element of the input row. But wait, in the output of Example 0, each row is just a single element. Wait, maybe they are taking the unique elements? But [1,1,1] would collapse to [1], which matches. Similarly, the output for Example 1 is the same as the input rows because all elements in each row are the same. So if all elements in a row are the same, the output row is the same as the input row. But wait, in Example 0, the first and third rows are [1,1,1], and their outputs are [1]. That fits. But Example 1's input is three rows each [3,4,6], and the output is [3,4,6]. Wait, but the input rows have elements that are the same across the row? No, wait the input for Example 1 is [3,4,6] repeated three times. Wait, each row is [3,4,6], so the output is [3,4,6]. So why is that? Because each row in the input has elements that are the same as the other rows? Or maybe there's another pattern.\n\nWait, maybe the output is the input rows with consecutive duplicates removed? But in Example 2, the input is three rows of [2,3,3,8,1], and the output is [2,3,8,1]. So that looks like removing consecutive duplicates. Because the original has two 3s next to each other. So if the output is deduplicated by consecutive elements, then each row in the output is the input row with consecutive duplicates removed. Let me check other examples.\n\nExample 3: Input is four rows. First row [2,2], output [2]. Second [6,6] becomes [6], third and fourth [8,8] become [8]. So yes, each input row is processed by collapsing consecutive duplicates. So the output is each input row with consecutive duplicates removed. That seems to fit.\n\nSimilarly, Example 4 has rows like [4,4,4,4] which becomes [4]. So consecutive duplicates are removed. So the pattern is: for each row in the input, output a row where consecutive duplicate elements are collapsed into a single occurrence.\n\nBut wait, looking at Example 2's output: [2,3,8,1]. The input row is [2,3,3,8,1]. So the two 3s are consecutive, so they are collapsed into one 3. That's exactly what's happening. So the transformation is removing consecutive duplicates in each row.\n\nBut then in Example 1's input: each row is [3,4,6]. There are no consecutive duplicates, so the output remains [3,4,6]. That fits. Similarly, in Example 0's first row [1,1,1], all are consecutive duplicates, so becomes [1]. \n\nSo the pattern is: for each row in the input, remove consecutive duplicate elements, keeping only the first occurrence of each run.\n\nNow, the test input is four rows of [1,1,2,3,3,3,8,8,4]. Applying the same transformation to each row. Let's process each element in order:\n\nOriginal row: [1,1,2,3,3,3,8,8,4]\n\nLooking for consecutive duplicates. Start with 1. The next is 1, same, so collapse into one 1. Then 2 is next and different. Then three 3s become one 3. Then two 8s become one 8, then 4. So the processed row should be [1,2,3,8,4]. \n\nSince the input has four identical rows, the output will have four rows each being [1,2,3,8,4]. But wait, let's check the training examples again. For example, in Example 0, each input row is processed individually, so even if the rows are the same as others, each is processed. So in the test case, each of the four input rows is processed independently. So the output will have four rows, each being the processed version of their input row, which is [1,2,3,8,4]. \n\nSo the final answer should be four rows of [1,2,3,8,4].",

        "cot_2": "Okay, let's see. I need to figure out the pattern from the training examples that transforms the input into the output. Let's start by looking at each example one by one.\n\nExample 0:\nInput is three rows of [1,1,1], [2,2,2], [1,1,1]. The output is [1], [2], [1]. Hmm. So each row in the input is a list of the same numbers. The output for each row is just a single instance of that number. So maybe if all elements in a row are the same, the output is that single element. But let's check other examples to confirm.\n\nExample 1:\nAll three rows are [3,4,6], and the output is the same [3,4,6]. Wait, why didn't they reduce it to a single element? Because in this case, each row isn't all the same number. The elements are different. So the output is the original array. So maybe the rule is: for each row, if all elements are the same, output a single instance; otherwise, keep the row as is but maybe remove duplicates?\n\nWait, example 2's input is three identical rows [2,3,3,8,1], and the output is [2,3,8,1]. The original row has 3 appearing twice. The output removes duplicates but keeps the order. So in the case where all the rows are the same, the output for each row is the row with consecutive duplicates removed. Wait, but in example 1, all rows are [3,4,6]. The output is the same as the input row. So maybe when all rows are the same, each output row is the input row with duplicates removed (not necessarily consecutive), but perhaps in example 1, since there are no duplicates in the row, it stays the same. Wait, in example 1's input row [3,4,6], all elements are unique. So the output is the same as the input. But example 2's input row has duplicates (the two 3s), so the output removes the duplicate 3. But wait, the output is [2,3,8,1], which is the original row with the consecutive 3s turned into a single 3. So maybe the transformation is to remove consecutive duplicates in each row, but only if all the rows are identical?\n\nWait, let me check example 3. The input has four rows: [2,2], [6,6], [8,8], [8,8]. The output is [2], [6], [8]. So each input row has two same elements, and output is a single element. So for rows that are all the same elements, they collapse to a single element. So example 0's rows are all same elements, output is single elements. But in example 1, each row is not all same elements, but all the rows are the same. The output is the same as the input row. So the pattern might be: For each row in the input, if all elements in the row are the same, output a list with a single element. Otherwise, if all the rows in the input are the same, then for each output row, remove consecutive duplicates (i.e., deduplicate by keeping the first occurrence in consecutive duplicates). Wait, but example 2's input rows are all [2,3,3,8,1], which when deduplicated (removing consecutive duplicates) becomes [2,3,8,1]. So each row in the output is the deduplicated version. But example 1's input rows are [3,4,6], which have no duplicates, so the output is the same. Example 0's input rows are all same elements, so they collapse to single elements.\n\nWait, but example 4: input has multiple rows. The input rows are [4,4,4,4], [4,4,4,4], [2,2,2,2], [2,2,2,2], [8,8,8,8], [3,3,3,3]. The output is [4], [2], [8], [3]. Wait, the input has 6 rows, but the output has 4 rows. Wait, no, looking again: the input has 6 rows. Let me count again:\n\nInput rows:\nRow 1: [4,4,4,4]\nRow 2: [4,4,4,4]\nRow 3: [2,2,2,2]\nRow 4: [2,2,2,2]\nRow 5: [8,8,8,8]\nRow 6: [3,3,3,3]\n\nOutput rows:\n[4], [2], [8], [3]. So the output has 4 rows. Wait, but the input has 6 rows. How does that happen? Oh, maybe the output is collapsing consecutive identical rows into a single row. For example, the first two rows of [4,4,4,4] become [4], then the next two rows [2,2,2,2] become [2], then [8,8,8,8] becomes [8], and the last row [3,3,3,3] becomes [3]. So maybe, the rule is: group consecutive identical rows. For each group of consecutive identical rows, if the row has all elements same, output a single element. If the rows in the group are the same but the row has elements that are not all same, then output the deduplicated version (removing consecutive duplicates) once.\n\nBut how does that fit with the examples.\n\nWait example 4's input rows are:\n\nFirst two rows are [4,4,4,4], which are same. So group them, output [4]. Then next two rows [2,2,2,2], output [2]. Then [8,8,8,8], output [8]. Then [3,3,3,3], output [3]. So the output has four rows. So in this case, consecutive identical rows are merged into a single output row. So the transformation is: collapse consecutive identical rows into one row. For each such row in the input, if the row is all same elements, output a single-element list. If the row has varying elements but all the same in the group, then deduplicate consecutive duplicates.\n\nWait example 0's input:\n\nThree rows of [1,1,1], [2,2,2], [1,1,1]. The output is [1], [2], [1]. So here, each row is consecutive and identical. So each is collapsed to a single element.\n\nExample 1's input has three identical rows [3,4,6]. So they are consecutive and same. So the output is deduplicated version. But in this case, the row has no consecutive duplicates, so output remains [3,4,6].\n\nBut in example 2, three identical rows [2,3,3,8,1]. The output is [2,3,8,1]. So the deduplication is removing consecutive duplicates. So the row's consecutive duplicates are merged.\n\nSo putting this together, the pattern seems to be:\n\n1. Group consecutive identical rows in the input. Each group of consecutive identical rows becomes a single row in the output.\n\n2. For each such group's row:\n\n   a. If all elements in the row are the same, output a single-element list containing that element.\n\n   b. If the row has varying elements, output the row with consecutive duplicates removed (i.e., each sequence of the same element is reduced to a single occurrence, but non-consecutive duplicates are kept).\n\nLet's verify this against all examples.\n\nExample 0:\n\nAll rows are consecutive and same. Each row is all same elements. So output is [1], [2], [1]. Correct.\n\nExample 1:\n\nThree identical rows. Each row has elements [3,4,6], which are not all same. So output is the row with consecutive duplicates removed. But there are no consecutive duplicates, so output [3,4,6]. Correct.\n\nExample 2:\n\nThree identical rows [2,3,3,8,1]. The row has consecutive duplicates (3,3). After deduplication, it's [2,3,8,1]. So output that once per group, but since the group is three rows, but they are merged into one output row. Wait, but in example 2, the output is [2,3,8,1], but the input has three rows. But according to the pattern, consecutive identical rows are grouped and output once. So in example 2, the three rows are the same and consecutive, so the output is a single row deduplicated. But the example's output is [2,3,8,1], but in the problem statement, example 2's output is that array. Wait no, the example 2's output is three rows? Wait, no. Let me check:\n\nWait in example 2, the input is three identical rows. The output is one row? Or the output is three rows each deduplicated? Because in the output of example 2, the output is given as:\n\n[2,3,8,1]\n\nBut looking at the original example:\n\n--Example 2-- \n\n INPUT: \n\n[2, 3, 3, 8, 1]\n[2, 3, 3, 8, 1]\n[2, 3, 3, 8, 1]\n\nOUTPUT: \n\n[2, 3, 8, 1]\n\nSo the output is a single row. But in the previous example 1, the output was three rows, each [3,4,6]. Wait, that's conflicting. Wait no, looking back:\n\nExample 1's input is three rows of [3,4,6], and the output is [3,4,6]. Wait, how many rows? Let me check:\n\n--Example 1-- \n\n INPUT: \n\n[3, 4, 6]\n[3, 4, 6]\n[3, 4, 6]\n\nOUTPUT: \n\n[3,4,6]\n\nSo the output is a single row. So the rule must be: when consecutive rows are identical, collapse them into one output row. Then, process that row by deduplicating if necessary.\n\nWait example 0's input is three rows: [1,1,1], [2,2,2], [1,1,1]. The output is three rows: [1], [2], [1]. So those groups are consecutive but not all same. Each group is a single row. So in example 0, the consecutive groups are:\n\nFirst group: one row of [1,1,1] \u2192 output [1].\n\nSecond group: one row of [2,2,2] \u2192 output [2].\n\nThird group: one row of [1,1,1] \u2192 output [1].\n\nSo each group is size one, so the output has three rows.\n\nIn example 1, all three rows are same. So group them into one, output the deduplicated row (which in this case is the same as the original since no duplicates). So output is one row.\n\nExample 2 has three same rows, grouped into one, deduplicated to [2,3,8,1], output as one row.\n\nWait, but according to example 1's input and output, the output is one row. But the example shows the output as:\n\n[3,4,6]\n\nWhich is a single row. So perhaps the rule is that for consecutive groups of identical rows, output a single row, processed as per the rules.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. For the input rows, group consecutive duplicates. So consecutive rows that are the same are merged into a single group.\n\n2. For each group:\n\n   a. If all elements in the row are the same, output a list with a single element.\n\n   b. Else, output the row with consecutive duplicates removed (i.e., collapse consecutive duplicates to one instance).\n\nSo let's verify this.\n\nExample 0:\n\nRows:\n\n[1,1,1] \u2192 group 1 \u2192 all same \u2192 [1]\n\n[2,2,2] \u2192 group 2 \u2192 all same \u2192 [2]\n\n[1,1,1] \u2192 group 3 \u2192 all same \u2192 [1]\n\nOutput is three rows, each [1], [2], [1]. Correct.\n\nExample 1:\n\nAll three rows same \u2192 group as one. The row is [3,4,6], which has no duplicates. So output is [3,4,6]. Correct.\n\nExample 2:\n\nThree rows same \u2192 group into one. Row is [2,3,3,8,1]. Consecutive duplicates are 3,3 \u2192 collapse to 3. So output [2,3,8,1]. Correct.\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput rows:\n\n[2,2] \u2192 group 1 \u2192 all same \u2192 [2]\n\n[6,6] \u2192 group 2 \u2192 all same \u2192 [6]\n\n[8,8] \u2192 group 3 \u2192 all same \u2192 [8]\n\n[8,8] \u2192 group 3 continues? Wait no, the input rows are:\n\nRow 1: [2,2]\n\nRow 2: [6,6]\n\nRow 3: [8,8]\n\nRow 4: [8,8]\n\nSo consecutive groups are:\n\nGroup 1: [2,2] (row 1) \u2192 [2]\n\nGroup 2: [6,6] (row 2) \u2192 [6]\n\nGroup 3: [8,8], [8,8] (rows 3-4) \u2192 merged into one group. Since the row is [8,8], all same \u2192 output [8]. So the output is three rows: [2], [6], [8]. But the example's output is:\n\n[2]\n\n[6]\n\n[8]\n\nWhich matches.\n\nExample 4:\n\nInput rows:\n\n[4,4,4,4] (row 1)\n\n[4,4,4,4] (row 2)\n\n[2,2,2,2] (row 3)\n\n[2,2,2,2] (row 4)\n\n[8,8,8,8] (row 5)\n\n[3,3,3,3] (row 6)\n\nGroups:\n\nGroup 1: rows 1-2 \u2192 [4,4,4,4] \u2192 all same \u2192 [4]\n\nGroup 2: rows 3-4 \u2192 [2,2,2,2] \u2192 all same \u2192 [2]\n\nGroup 3: row 5 \u2192 [8,8,8,8] \u2192 [8]\n\nGroup 4: row 6 \u2192 [3,3,3,3] \u2192 [3]\n\nSo output is four rows: [4], [2], [8], [3]. Which matches the example.\n\nSo the pattern is: group consecutive identical rows. For each group, if the row is all same elements, output a single-element list. Otherwise, output the row with consecutive duplicates removed.\n\nNow, let's apply this to the test input.\n\nTest Input:\n\n[1,1,2,3,3,3,8,8,4]\n\n[1,1,2,3,3,3,8,8,4]\n\n[1,1,2,3,3,3,8,8,4]\n\n[1,1,2,3,3,3,8,8,4]\n\nSo all four rows are the same. So they form a single group. The row is [1,1,2,3,3,3,8,8,4]. Now, check if all elements are the same. No. So we need to process this row by removing consecutive duplicates.\n\nOriginal row: [1,1,2,3,3,3,8,8,4]\n\nConsecutive duplicates:\n\n- The first two 1s \u2192 collapse to 1.\n\nThen 2 (no duplicates).\n\nThen three 3s \u2192 collapse to 3.\n\nThen two 8s \u2192 collapse to 8.\n\nThen 4 (no duplicates).\n\nSo the deduplicated row is [1,2,3,8,4].\n\nSince the group is all four identical rows, the output for this group is [1,2,3,8,4]. So the output should be a single row with this array.\n\nWait, but the problem's answer format for the examples shows that when groups are collapsed into one, the output is a single row. For example, in example 1, three rows are collapsed into one. So here, four rows should become one row.\n\nSo the output should be:\n\n[1,2,3,8,4]\n\nBut wait, looking at the training examples, when consecutive rows are identical, the output is one row. For example, example 1 had three identical rows, output one row. So the test input has four identical rows, so output one row. The row is [1,1,2,3,3,3,8,8,4] \u2192 deduped to [1,2,3,8,4].\n\nTherefore, the expected output is:\n\n[1,2,3,8,4]\n\nBut wait, looking at the example 2's output, when three identical rows are input, the output is the deduplicated row. So yes.\n\nSo the final answer for the test input should be a single row [1,2,3,8,4]."
