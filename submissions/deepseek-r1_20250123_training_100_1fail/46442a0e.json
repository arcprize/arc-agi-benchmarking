        "cot_1": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. So, looking at the training examples, I need to see how the input arrays are transformed into the output. Let's start with Example 0.\n\nIn Example 0, the input is two rows: [8,6] and [6,8]. The output is four rows. The first output row is [8,6,6,8], which looks like the first input row followed by the second input row reversed. Wait, no, the second input row is [6,8], reversed would be [8,6], so appending that gives [8,6,8,6], but the actual first output row is [8,6,6,8]. Hmm. Wait, maybe it's the first row followed by the second row as is. The second row of input is [6,8], so appending that to the first gives [8,6,6,8]. Then the second output row is [6,8,8,6], which is the second input row followed by the first reversed. Then the third output row is the same as the second, and the fourth is the same as the first. So perhaps there's a mirroring happening here. Like, the output is created by taking each input row and appending the reversed row of another row, then mirroring the entire structure.\n\nBut maybe another approach. Let's look at the output dimensions. Example 0's input is 2x2, output is 4x4. Wait no, the output has 4 rows, each with 4 elements. Wait, input is 2 rows of 2 elements each. Output is 4 rows of 4 elements each. So the output is double the size in both dimensions. Similarly, Example 1's input is 3x3, output is 6x6. Example 2's input is 3x3, output is 6x6. So the pattern seems to be that the output is double the size of the input in both dimensions. So each element in the input is expanded into a 2x2 block in the output. But how are those blocks determined?\n\nLooking at Example 0 again. The input rows are [8,6] and [6,8]. The output has four rows. Let's see:\n\nFirst output row: [8,6,6,8] which is input row 0 followed by input row 1. Then the second output row: [6,8,8,6] which is input row 1 followed by input row 0 reversed? Or maybe input row 1 and then row 0's reverse. Then the third and fourth rows are repetitions of the second and first. Wait, looking at the output:\n\nRow 0: 8,6,6,8 \u2192 input row0 followed by row1.\n\nRow1: 6,8,8,6 \u2192 input row1 followed by row0 reversed (since row0 is [8,6], reversed is [6,8], but here it's [8,6] after row1. Wait, maybe row1 followed by row0's reverse. So row1 is [6,8], then reversed row0 is [6,8], making [6,8,6,8], but the output row1 is [6,8,8,6]. Hmm, not matching. Alternatively, maybe each row in the output is created by taking the original row and appending another row modified in some way, then the entire structure is mirrored or repeated.\n\nAlternatively, looking at Example 1. The input is three rows, each with three elements. The output has six rows, each with six elements. Let's look at the first two output rows:\n\n[7,7,8,8,7,7]\n[7,7,8,8,7,7]\n\nSo these are duplicates of the same row. Then the next two rows are [8,8,8,8,8,8] repeated twice. Then again the first two rows again. So perhaps each input row is duplicated, and each element in the input is duplicated as well. Wait, input row is [7,7,8], so duplicated becomes [7,7,8,7,7,8] but the output rows are [7,7,8,8,7,7]. So maybe there's a reversal involved. The original row [7,7,8] becomes [7,7,8, reverse of the row]. The reverse of [7,7,8] is [8,7,7], so appending that would give [7,7,8,8,7,7]. Then each of these is duplicated. So each input row is transformed into a row in the output by appending its reverse, and each such transformed row is written twice. Then for the input rows, perhaps the same pattern applies. For example, in Example 1, input has three rows. So output rows would be:\n\nTransformed row0 (append reverse) \u2192 written twice.\n\nTransformed row1 (same as row0, so same as above) \u2192 written twice.\n\nTransformed row2 (input is [8,8,8], reversed is same, so append gives [8,8,8,8,8,8]) \u2192 written twice.\n\nSo the output is formed by taking each input row, appending its reverse, then duplicating each such transformed row. Then the order of the output rows is the same as the input rows, but each transformed row is duplicated.\n\nSo for Example 0, input has two rows. Each transformed row is row + reversed row. Then each is duplicated. So output rows would be:\n\nRow0: [8,6] + [6,8] \u2192 [8,6,6,8] (duplicated twice?)\n\nWait, but in Example 0's output, the first row is [8,6,6,8], the second is [6,8,8,6], third is same as second, fourth same as first. So maybe for each input row, we create two output rows: the row followed by reversed next row? Not sure.\n\nWait, in Example 0's input:\n\nRow0: [8,6]\n\nRow1: [6,8]\n\nThe output's first row is [8,6,6,8] which is row0 followed by row1. The second output row is [6,8,8,6], which is row1 followed by reversed row0 (since reversed row0 is [6,8], so appending gives [6,8,6,8], but the actual is [6,8,8,6]. Hmm, perhaps it's row1 followed by row0 reversed in reverse order. Wait, row0 reversed is [6,8], but then reversed again? No. Alternatively, maybe each pair of input rows is combined in some way.\n\nAlternatively, looking at Example 2's input and output. Input is 3x3:\n\n[6,9,9]\n\n[6,4,4]\n\n[6,4,4]\n\nThe output is 6 rows. Let's see:\n\nFirst output row: [6,9,9,6,6,6]. Hmm. The original first row is [6,9,9]. So maybe this is transformed by appending [6,6,6]. Where does that come from? The first element of the next row? Or perhaps looking at the corresponding elements from mirrored rows.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is constructed by mirroring the input matrix both horizontally and vertically. For example, for a 2x2 input, mirroring would create a 4x4 output. But how?\n\nAnother approach: the output's size is double the input's. So for each element in the input, there's a corresponding 2x2 block in the output. Let's check Example 0:\n\nInput is 2x2. Output is 4x4, which is 2x2 blocks each of 2x2 elements. Let's see:\n\nOriginal matrix:\n\nRow0: [8,6]\n\nRow1: [6,8]\n\nOutput:\n\nRow0: 8,6,6,8 \u2192 which could be the original row0 followed by row0 reversed (since row0 reversed is [6,8], but wait, no. Row0 is [8,6], reversed is [6,8], so appending gives [8,6,6,8]. Then the next row is row1 followed by row1 reversed? Row1 is [6,8], reversed is [8,6], so [6,8,8,6]. Then the third row is same as row1 reversed followed by row0 reversed? Not sure. But the output rows 0 and 3 are the same, and rows 1 and 2 are same. So maybe the output is arranged as a 2x2 grid of the input blocks. Like, the top-left is the original matrix, top-right is original matrix reversed horizontally, bottom-left is reversed vertically, and bottom-right is reversed both? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is formed by concatenating the original matrix with its horizontal flip, then concatenating vertically with the vertical flip and horizontal flip again. But how does that fit with the examples?\n\nLet's take Example 0. Original matrix is:\n\n8 6\n\n6 8\n\nHorizontal flip of this matrix would be:\n\n6 8\n\n8 6\n\nSo if we concatenate original and horizontal flip horizontally, we get:\n\n8 6 6 8\n\n6 8 8 6\n\nThen vertical flip of the original is:\n\n6 8\n\n8 6\n\nHorizontal flip of that would be:\n\n8 6\n\n6 8\n\nSo concatenating those gives:\n\n8 6 6 8\n\n6 8 8 6\n\nThen the entire output is the original concatenated with horizontal flip, followed by vertical flip concatenated with horizontal-vertical flip. Which gives four rows. So the output is:\n\nOriginal matrix followed by horizontal flip \u2192 two rows.\n\nThen vertical flip followed by horizontal-vertical flip \u2192 two rows.\n\nSo for Example 0, the output is:\n\nRow0: 8 6 | 6 8 \u2192 [8,6,6,8]\n\nRow1: 6 8 | 8 6 \u2192 [6,8,8,6]\n\nThen vertical flip of original is:\n\n6 8\n\n8 6\n\nSo their horizontal flips would be:\n\n8 6\n\n6 8\n\nSo Row2: 6 8 | 8 6 \u2192 same as Row1.\n\nRow3: 8 6 | 6 8 \u2192 same as Row0.\n\nWait, but this would make the output rows:\n\nRow0: [8,6,6,8]\n\nRow1: [6,8,8,6]\n\nRow2: [6,8,8,6]\n\nRow3: [8,6,6,8]\n\nWhich matches Example 0's output. So the pattern seems to be that the output is formed by concatenating the original matrix with its horizontal flip, then the vertical flip of the original matrix with its horizontal flip. Then each of these concatenations is a row in the output. Then the vertical flip part is the same as the original's vertical flip, but perhaps the order is different.\n\nTesting this on Example 1. Input is 3x3:\n\n7 7 8\n\n7 7 8\n\n8 8 8\n\nThe horizontal flip of each row would reverse the elements. So the horizontal flip of the first row [7,7,8] is [8,7,7]. The original matrix is:\n\nRow0: 7 7 8\n\nRow1: 7 7 8\n\nRow2: 8 8 8\n\nHorizontal flip for each row would be:\n\nRow0 flipped: 8 7 7\n\nRow1 flipped: 8 7 7\n\nRow2 flipped: 8 8 8 (since it's symmetric)\n\nSo concatenating original and horizontal flip for each row:\n\nRow0: 7 7 8 | 8 7 7 \u2192 [7,7,8,8,7,7]\n\nRow1: 7 7 8 | 8 7 7 \u2192 same as Row0.\n\nRow2: 8 8 8 | 8 8 8 \u2192 [8,8,8,8,8,8]\n\nThen the vertical flip of the original matrix is the rows in reverse order:\n\nRow2: 8 8 8\n\nRow1: 7 7 8\n\nRow0: 7 7 8\n\nThen the horizontal flip of each row in the vertical flip matrix would be:\n\nRow2: 8 8 8 \u2192 same as original.\n\nRow1 flipped: 8 7 7\n\nRow0 flipped: 8 7 7\n\nSo concatenating vertical flip rows with their horizontal flips:\n\nRow3 (vertical flip row0): 8 8 8 | 8 8 8 \u2192 [8,8,8,8,8,8]\n\nRow4 (vertical flip row1): 7 7 8 | 8 7 7 \u2192 [7,7,8,8,7,7]\n\nRow5 (vertical flip row2): 7 7 8 | 8 7 7 \u2192 [7,7,8,8,7,7]\n\nBut in Example 1's output, the rows are:\n\n[7,7,8,8,7,7]\n\n[7,7,8,8,7,7]\n\n[8,8,8,8,8,8]\n\n[8,8,8,8,8,8]\n\n[7,7,8,8,7,7]\n\n[7,7,8,8,7,7]\n\nSo the order after the original part is the vertical flip, but in the output, after the first three rows (original and horizontal), the next three are vertical flip and their horizontal flips. Wait, but the vertical flip of the original matrix would be:\n\nRow0 of vertical flip: original row2 \u2192 8 8 8\n\nRow1: original row1 \u2192 7 7 8\n\nRow2: original row0 \u2192 7 7 8\n\nThen concatenating each of these with their horizontal flips:\n\nRow0 of vertical flip: 8 8 8 + horizontal flip (8 8 8) \u2192 [8,8,8,8,8,8]\n\nRow1 of vertical flip:7 7 8 + horizontal flip (8 7 7) \u2192 [7,7,8,8,7,7]\n\nRow2 of vertical flip:7 7 8 + horizontal flip (8 7 7) \u2192 [7,7,8,8,7,7]\n\nSo the vertical flip part's concatenated rows are:\n\n[8,8,8,8,8,8], [7,7,8,8,7,7], [7,7,8,8,7,7]\n\nBut in the output, after the first two rows (original and horizontal) comes two rows of [8,8,8,...], then two rows of [7,7,8,...]. Wait, the output is:\n\nRows 0 and 1: [7,7,8,8,7,7] repeated twice.\n\nRows 2 and 3: [8,8,8,8,8,8] repeated twice.\n\nRows 4 and 5: [7,7,8,8,7,7] repeated twice.\n\nHmm, this suggests that each transformed row is duplicated. So for each row in the original matrix, after concatenating with its horizontal flip, we write that row twice. Then for the vertical flipped rows, we do the same. So for Example 1:\n\nOriginal rows:\n\nRow0 \u2192 [7,7,8,8,7,7], written twice.\n\nRow1 \u2192 same as row0, so written twice again.\n\nRow2 \u2192 [8,8,8,8,8,8], written twice.\n\nThen vertical flip rows:\n\nRow0 of vertical flip \u2192 [8,8,8,8,8,8], written twice.\n\nRow1 of vertical flip \u2192 [7,7,8,8,7,7], written twice.\n\nRow2 of vertical flip \u2192 same as row1, written twice.\n\nBut the output in Example1 has six rows. So combining, the output is:\n\nOriginal rows (each duplicated):\n\n[7,7,8,8,7,7]\n\n[7,7,8,8,7,7]\n\n[7,7,8,8,7,7]\n\n[7,7,8,8,7,7]\n\n[8,8,8,8,8,8]\n\n[8,8,8,8,8,8]\n\nWait, but the actual output for Example1 is:\n\n[7,7,8,8,7,7]\n\n[7,7,8,8,7,7]\n\n[8,8,8,8,8,8]\n\n[8,8,8,8,8,8]\n\n[7,7,8,8,7,7]\n\n[7,7,8,8,7,7]\n\nSo that's two rows of original transformed, two rows of row2 transformed, then two rows of original transformed again. So perhaps the pattern is to create a matrix that is the original matrix concatenated with its horizontal flip, then the vertical flip of the original matrix concatenated with its horizontal flip, but each row is duplicated. Or maybe the entire structure is mirrored both ways.\n\nAlternatively, the output is constructed by first taking each row of the input and appending its reverse to form a new row. Then, the entire list of these new rows is duplicated, followed by the vertical flip of these new rows (i.e., the rows in reverse order) duplicated. Let me check this with Example0:\n\nOriginal rows:\n\nRow0: [8,6] \u2192 append reversed \u2192 [8,6,6,8]\n\nRow1: [6,8] \u2192 append reversed \u2192 [6,8,8,6]\n\nSo new rows are:\n\n[8,6,6,8]\n\n[6,8,8,6]\n\nThen duplicate each row: so two copies of each.\n\nThen vertical flip (reverse the order of the rows) \u2192 [6,8,8,6], [8,6,6,8], each duplicated.\n\nSo the output would be:\n\nRow0: [8,6,6,8]\n\nRow1: [8,6,6,8]\n\nRow2: [6,8,8,6]\n\nRow3: [6,8,8,6]\n\nThen vertical flip duplicated:\n\nRow4: [6,8,8,6]\n\nRow5: [6,8,8,6]\n\nRow6: [8,6,6,8]\n\nRow7: [8,6,6,8]\n\nBut the Example0 output has four rows. So this doesn't fit. So maybe that approach is incorrect.\n\nAlternative approach for Example2. Input is 3x3:\n\n[6,9,9]\n\n[6,4,4]\n\n[6,4,4]\n\nOutput is 6 rows. Let's look at the first output row: [6,9,9,6,6,6]. The original first row is [6,9,9]. Appending something. What's [6,6,6]? Maybe it's the first element of the next rows. Or perhaps it's the same column elements from mirrored parts.\n\nAnother angle: Each element in the input matrix is mirrored in the output in a way that forms a larger matrix. For example, each element is replaced by a 2x2 block. The block might be the element itself and some transformation based on neighboring elements or symmetry.\n\nAlternatively, looking at Example2's output rows:\n\nRow0: [6,9,9,6,6,6]\n\nRow1: [6,4,4,4,4,9]\n\nRow2: [6,4,4,4,4,9]\n\nRow3: [9,4,4,4,4,6]\n\nRow4: [9,4,4,4,4,6]\n\nRow5: [6,6,6,9,9,6]\n\nHmm. Let's see if there's a pattern. The first three rows of the output could be the original rows expanded, and the next three are their mirror images.\n\nFor instance, row0: [6,9,9] followed by [6,6,6]. Where does [6,6,6] come from? It could be the first element of the row (6) repeated three times. Or maybe taking the first element of the row and appending it thrice. Then row1 and row2 are [6,4,4] followed by [4,4,9]. But where does the 9 come from? Maybe the last element of the original row. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each element in the input is duplicated in the output, but with some transformation. For example, the first row of input is [6,9,9]. Each element is turned into a pair. For 6, maybe [6, something], and for 9, [9, something else]. But looking at row0 of the output: 6,9,9,6,6,6. So the first three elements are the original, then three 6s. That's unclear.\n\nAlternatively, considering that the output is a combination of the original matrix and its transposed matrix or something similar. But I'm not sure.\n\nWait, let's think about the output dimensions. For the input of size m x n, the output is 2m x 2n. So each element is somehow expanded into a 2x2 block. Let's see for Example0, input is 2x2, output 4x4. So each element becomes a 2x2 block.\n\nOriginal matrix:\n\na b\n\nc d\n\nOutput becomes:\n\na b b a\n\nc d d c\n\nc d d c\n\na b b a\n\nWait, Example0's input is:\n\n8 6\n\n6 8\n\nOutput is:\n\n8 6 6 8\n\n6 8 8 6\n\n6 8 8 6\n\n8 6 6 8\n\nSo the first row is 8,6,6,8. Which would be the original row followed by its reverse. Then the second row is 6,8,8,6, which is the original second row followed by its reverse. Then third row is same as second. Fourth same as first.\n\nSo perhaps each row is duplicated in the output, once as row + reversed row, and once as reversed row + row. Wait no.\n\nAlternatively, the output is constructed by mirroring the entire matrix both horizontally and vertically. For example, the original matrix is placed in the top-left, mirrored to the top-right, mirrored to the bottom-left, and mirrored to the bottom-right. But how?\n\nIn Example0, the top-left quadrant is [8,6; 6,8], top-right is [6,8; 8,6], bottom-left is [6,8; 8,6], bottom-right is [8,6;6,8]. So the output would be:\n\n8 6 | 6 8\n\n6 8 | 8 6\n\n------------\n\n6 8 | 8 6\n\n8 6 |6 8\n\nWhich matches the output. So the output is the original matrix in the top-left, its horizontal mirror (each row reversed) in the top-right, its vertical mirror (each column reversed) in the bottom-left, and the vertical-horizontal mirror (both reversed) in the bottom-right.\n\nSo for Example0, the output is:\n\nOriginal | Horizontal mirror\n\nVertical mirror | Vertical-Horizontal mirror\n\nWhich gives:\n\nRow0: 8 6 | 6 8 \u2192 original row0 followed by reversed row0.\n\nRow1: 6 8 | 8 6 \u2192 original row1 followed by reversed row1.\n\nRow2: 6 8 | 8 6 \u2192 reversed column0 (original row1) followed by reversed row1.\n\nRow3: 8 6 |6 8 \u2192 reversed column0 row0 followed by reversed row0.\n\nWait, this might not fit. Alternatively, the entire matrix is mirrored horizontally and vertically. For a 2x2 matrix, the output would be the original matrix, followed by its horizontal flip, then the vertical flip of the original, followed by the vertical flip of the horizontal flip. But this would result in a 2x2 grid of blocks.\n\nFor example:\n\nOriginal matrix:\n\nA B\n\nC D\n\nHorizontal flip (each row reversed):\n\nB A\n\nD C\n\nVertical flip (rows reversed):\n\nC D\n\nA B\n\nVertical flip of horizontal flip:\n\nD C\n\nB A\n\nSo the full output would be:\n\nA B B A\n\nC D D C\n\nC D D C\n\nA B B A\n\nWhich matches Example0's output. So the pattern is to create a larger matrix by placing the original matrix, its horizontal flip, vertical flip, and vertical-horizontal flip in a 2x2 grid. Then each row of the output is the concatenation of the corresponding row from the original and horizontal flip for the top part, and from the vertical flip and vertical-horizontal flip for the bottom part.\n\nSo applying this pattern, for any input matrix, the output is formed by:\n\n1. Create the horizontal flip of the input matrix (each row reversed).\n\n2. Create the vertical flip of the input matrix (rows reversed in order).\n\n3. Create the vertical flip of the horizontal flip (rows reversed in order and each row reversed).\n\nThen, arrange these four matrices in a 2x2 grid:\n\nOriginal | Horizontal Flip\n\nVertical Flip | Vertical Flip of Horizontal Flip\n\nSo each row of the output is the concatenation of the corresponding row from the original and horizontal flip, then the corresponding row from the vertical flip and vertical flip of horizontal flip.\n\nBut how does this work for Example1, which is 3x3? Let's check.\n\nExample1 input is:\n\n7 7 8\n\n7 7 8\n\n8 8 8\n\nHorizontal flip (each row reversed):\n\n8 7 7\n\n8 7 7\n\n8 8 8\n\nVertical flip (rows in reverse order):\n\n8 8 8\n\n7 7 8\n\n7 7 8\n\nVertical flip of horizontal flip (rows reversed and each row reversed):\n\n8 8 8\n\n7 7 8\n\n7 7 8\n\nWait, no. Vertical flip of horizontal flip would be the vertical flip of the horizontal flipped matrix. The horizontal flipped matrix is:\n\nRow0:8 7 7\n\nRow1:8 7 7\n\nRow2:8 8 8\n\nVertical flip of that would be rows reversed:\n\nRow0:8 8 8\n\nRow1:8 7 7\n\nRow2:8 7 7\n\nSo the vertical flip of horizontal flip matrix is:\n\n8 8 8\n\n8 7 7\n\n8 7 7\n\nNow, arrange the four matrices:\n\nOriginal | Horizontal Flip\n\nVertical Flip | Vertical Flip of Horizontal Flip\n\nOriginal matrix:\n\nRow0:7 7 8\n\nRow1:7 7 8\n\nRow2:8 8 8\n\nHorizontal Flip:\n\nRow0:8 7 7\n\nRow1:8 7 7\n\nRow2:8 8 8\n\nVertical Flip:\n\nRow0:8 8 8\n\nRow1:7 7 8\n\nRow2:7 7 8\n\nVertical Flip of Horizontal Flip:\n\nRow0:8 8 8\n\nRow1:8 7 7\n\nRow2:8 7 7\n\nSo concatenating Original and Horizontal Flip for each row:\n\nOriginal rows + Horizontal Flip rows:\n\nRow0:7 7 8 |8 7 7 \u2192 [7,7,8,8,7,7]\n\nRow1:7 7 8 |8 7 7 \u2192 [7,7,8,8,7,7]\n\nRow2:8 8 8 |8 8 8 \u2192 [8,8,8,8,8,8]\n\nThen Vertical Flip and Vertical Flip of Horizontal Flip:\n\nRow0 of Vertical Flip:8 8 8 |8 8 8 \u2192 [8,8,8,8,8,8]\n\nRow1 of Vertical Flip:7 7 8 |8 7 7 \u2192 [7,7,8,8,7,7]\n\nRow2 of Vertical Flip:7 7 8 |8 7 7 \u2192 [7,7,8,8,7,7]\n\nSo the entire output would be:\n\nOriginal part:\n\n[7,7,8,8,7,7]\n\n[7,7,8,8,7,7]\n\n[8,8,8,8,8,8]\n\nVertical part:\n\n[8,8,8,8,8,8]\n\n[7,7,8,8,7,7]\n\n[7,7,8,8,7,7]\n\nSo combining them in the order Original followed by Vertical Flip part:\n\nRow0: [7,7,8,8,7,7]\n\nRow1: [7,7,8,8,7,7]\n\nRow2: [8,8,8,8,8,8]\n\nRow3: [8,8,8,8,8,8]\n\nRow4: [7,7,8,8,7,7]\n\nRow5: [7,7,8,8,7,7]\n\nWhich matches Example1's output. So this pattern holds.\n\nNow, let's look at Example2. Input is:\n\n6 9 9\n\n6 4 4\n\n6 4 4\n\nHorizontal flip of each row:\n\nRow0:9 9 6\n\nRow1:4 4 6\n\nRow2:4 4 6\n\nVertical flip of the original (rows reversed):\n\nRow0:6 4 4\n\nRow1:6 4 4\n\nRow2:6 9 9\n\nVertical flip of the horizontal flip (rows reversed and each row reversed):\n\nOriginal horizontal flip matrix is:\n\n9 9 6\n\n4 4 6\n\n4 4 6\n\nVertical flip of that is rows reversed:\n\n4 4 6\n\n4 4 6\n\n9 9 6\n\nSo the vertical flip of horizontal flip matrix is:\n\n4 4 6\n\n4 4 6\n\n9 9 6\n\nNow, concatenate original and horizontal flip for each row:\n\nRow0:6 9 9 |9 9 6 \u2192 [6,9,9,9,9,6]\n\nWait, but the output row0 is [6,9,9,6,6,6]. Hmm, this doesn't match. So perhaps the pattern is different for Example2. Wait, according to the earlier pattern, Example2's output should be:\n\nOriginal and horizontal flip rows:\n\nRow0:6 9 9 |9 9 6 \u2192 [6,9,9,9,9,6]\n\nRow1:6 4 4 |4 4 6 \u2192 [6,4,4,4,4,6]\n\nRow2:6 4 4 |4 4 6 \u2192 [6,4,4,4,4,6]\n\nVertical flip and vertical flip of horizontal flip:\n\nVertical flip of original is:\n\n6 4 4\n\n6 4 4\n\n6 9 9\n\nVertical flip of horizontal flip is:\n\n4 4 6\n\n4 4 6\n\n9 9 6\n\nSo concatenate vertical flip rows and vertical flip of horizontal flip rows:\n\nRow0 of vertical flip:6 4 4 |4 4 6 \u2192 [6,4,4,4,4,6]\n\nRow1:6 4 4 |4 4 6 \u2192 [6,4,4,4,4,6]\n\nRow2:6 9 9 |9 9 6 \u2192 [6,9,9,9,9,6]\n\nBut the actual output for Example2 is:\n\n[6,9,9,6,6,6]\n\n[6,4,4,4,4,9]\n\n[6,4,4,4,4,9]\n\n[9,4,4,4,4,6]\n\n[9,4,4,4,4,6]\n\n[6,6,6,9,9,6]\n\nThis doesn't fit the previous pattern, so perhaps there's a different transformation here. Therefore, my previous assumption might be incorrect. So I need to re-examine the examples to find a different pattern.\n\nLooking at Example2's input and output:\n\nInput rows:\n\nRow0:6,9,9\n\nRow1:6,4,4\n\nRow2:6,4,4\n\nOutput rows:\n\nRow0:6,9,9,6,6,6 \u2192 The first three elements are row0, then 6,6,6. Where do those 6s come from? Maybe the first element of row0 (6) is repeated thrice. So perhaps each row is appended with the first element of the row repeated. For row0, first element is 6, so append three 6s. But then the output row would be [6,9,9,6,6,6]. But row1's output is [6,4,4,4,4,9]. The first three elements are row1, then 4,4,9. The first element of row1 is 6, but the appended elements are 4,4,9. So that doesn't fit. Alternatively, perhaps each row is appended with the reverse of another row. For row0, the original row is [6,9,9]. Maybe appended with [6,6,6], which is the first element of the next rows. But row1 starts with 6, and row2 also starts with 6, so maybe taking the first elements of the next rows. But row0's appended part is 6,6,6, which matches the first elements of the next three rows? But there are three elements here, and the input is 3 rows. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the output row1: [6,4,4,4,4,9]. The first three elements are row1 of input. The next three are [4,4,9]. Which is the last two elements of row1 (4,4) and the last element of row0 (9). Not sure. This seems arbitrary.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation involves taking each row, appending it with a reversed and modified version. For example, the first half of the output row is the original row, and the second half is a transformed version based on certain rules. But what rules?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by creating a larger matrix where each element is mirrored with its adjacent elements. For Example2, perhaps each row is mirrored with some transformation. But it's not clear.\n\nAlternatively, the pattern involves rotating the matrix or elements in a certain way. But I'm not sure.\n\nAnother idea: for each input row, the output has two rows. The first is the original row followed by some transformation, and the second is another transformation. Then this is done for all rows and their transformed counterparts.\n\nLooking at Example2's output, the first three rows are:\n\n[6,9,9,6,6,6]\n\n[6,4,4,4,4,9]\n\n[6,4,4,4,4,9]\n\nThe next three are:\n\n[9,4,4,4,4,6]\n\n[9,4,4,4,4,6]\n\n[6,6,6,9,9,6]\n\nLooking at the first row, it's row0 of input followed by 6,6,6. The last three elements could be the first element of row0 (6) repeated. But the second row is row1 followed by 4,4,9. The 4s are from row1's elements 4 and 4, and the 9 is from row0's last element. Third row is same as second. Fourth row is [9,4,4,4,4,6], which starts with 9 (row0's last element), then four 4s (from row1 and 2's elements), and 6 (row0's first element). Fifth row is same as fourth. Sixth row starts with 6, then three 6s, then row0's last elements (9,9,6). \n\nThis seems very complicated, and I'm not seeing a clear pattern here. Perhaps the pattern varies between examples, but that's unlikely. Alternatively, maybe the pattern is that each element in the input is replaced by a block that combines the element and its mirror in some way, and the mirroring depends on the position.\n\nAlternatively, looking at Example2's output matrix, perhaps it's a combination of the original matrix and its transpose, but scaled. But the transpose of the input would be:\n\n6,6,6\n\n9,4,4\n\n9,4,4\n\nWhich doesn't seem to align with the output rows.\n\nAlternatively, considering that the output is a 2x2 expansion where each element is paired with its diagonal counterpart. For example, in Example0, the element a (8) is paired with d (8), and b (6) with c (6). But this isn't clear.\n\nGiven that I'm stuck with Example2, perhaps I should look for another approach. Let's consider that in each example, the output rows are a combination of the input rows and their transformed versions, and the entire output is a reflection of the input matrix in some way.\n\nAnother observation: in Example0 and Example1, each row in the output is duplicated. For Example0, each row appears twice. For Example1, each transformed row is duplicated twice. Example2's output has some rows duplicated as well. For instance, rows 1 and 2 are the same, rows 3 and 4 are the same, and rows 0 and 5 are unique. So perhaps each transformed row is written twice, but how?\n\nAlternatively, the output is created by first generating a transformed matrix where each row is the original row followed by its reverse. Then, this transformed matrix is concatenated with its vertical flip. For Example0:\n\nTransformed rows:\n\nRow0:8,6,6,8\n\nRow1:6,8,8,6\n\nVertical flip of transformed matrix:\n\nRow0:6,8,8,6\n\nRow1:8,6,6,8\n\nSo concatenating them:\n\n[8,6,6,8]\n\n[6,8,8,6]\n\n[6,8,8,6]\n\n[8,6,6,8]\n\nWhich matches Example0. For Example1:\n\nTransformed rows are:\n\nRow0:7,7,8,8,7,7\n\nRow1:7,7,8,8,7,7\n\nRow2:8,8,8,8,8,8\n\nVertical flip of transformed matrix:\n\nRow0:8,8,8,8,8,8\n\nRow1:7,7,8,8,7,7\n\nRow2:7,7,8,8,7,7\n\nConcatenating transformed and vertical flip gives:\n\nRow0:7,7,8,8,7,7\n\nRow1:7,7,8,8,7,7\n\nRow2:8,8,8,8,8,8\n\nRow3:8,8,8,8,8,8\n\nRow4:7,7,8,8,7,7\n\nRow5:7,7,8,8,7,7\n\nWhich matches Example1's output. For Example2, the transformed matrix would be:\n\nOriginal rows followed by their reverse.\n\nRow0:6,9,9 \u2192 reverse is [9,9,6], so transformed row0:6,9,9,9,9,6 \u2192 but the output row0 is [6,9,9,6,6,6]. So this doesn't match. Thus, this approach fails for Example2.\n\nSo what's different about Example2? Let's look at the output rows again:\n\nRow0:6,9,9,6,6,6 \u2192 original row0 followed by three 6s.\n\nRow1 and 2:6,4,4,4,4,9 \u2192 original row1 followed by 4,4,9.\n\nRow3 and 4:9,4,4,4,4,6 \u2192 starts with 9, then four 4s, then 6.\n\nRow5:6,6,6,9,9,6 \u2192 three 6s, then original row0's last two elements and 6.\n\nThis is more complex. Perhaps the pattern involves something like taking each row and appending elements from other rows. For example, row0 is followed by the first element of each row in reverse order. But row0 in Example2's input is [6,9,9]. The first elements of each row are 6,6,6. Reversed would be 6,6,6. Appended to row0 gives [6,9,9,6,6,6], which matches row0. Then row1 is [6,4,4]. The first elements of the rows are 6,6,6. Reversed, but maybe the first elements of the columns. Or perhaps the last elements of the columns. For row1, the last elements are 9,4,4. Appended as [4,4,9], which is row1's last two elements and row0's last element. So row1 is [6,4,4,4,4,9]. Similarly, row3 starts with 9, which is row0's last element, then four 4s (from row1 and row2's middle elements), then 6 (row0's first element). \n\nThis seems possible. So the pattern could be:\n\nFor each row in the input, create a new row by appending certain elements from other rows. Then the output is formed by these new rows and their mirrored versions.\n\nBut how to generalize this?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is a combination of the original matrix and its rotations. For example, original matrix, rotated 180 degrees, etc. But I'm not sure.\n\nAnother observation: in Example2's output, the first three rows are the original rows modified, and the last three are their mirror images. For example, row3 is [9,4,4,4,4,6], which is row0's output reversed. Row5 is [6,6,6,9,9,6], which is row0's output reversed. So perhaps the output is the transformed matrix followed by its vertical flip.\n\nBut how to determine the transformation for each row.\n\nAlternatively, the pattern involves taking each row and appending the reverse of another row. For example, row0 is followed by reversed row of row0. But Example0's row0 becomes row0 + row0 reversed. But in Example0, row0 is [8,6], reversed is [6,8]. So [8,6,6,8], which matches the first output row. But in Example1, row0 is [7,7,8], reversed is [8,7,7]. Appending that gives [7,7,8,8,7,7], which matches the first output row. Then row1 is [7,7,8], appending its reverse gives same as row0. Row2 is [8,8,8], appending reverse gives same. So this would explain Example1's output. For Example2, row0 is [6,9,9], appending reversed gives [6,9,9,9,9,6], but the output row0 is [6,9,9,6,6,6]. So this doesn't fit. Therefore, this pattern works for Examples0 and 1 but not for Example2.\n\nThis inconsistency suggests that there's a different pattern. But since Example2 is part of the training data, the pattern must be consistent.\n\nAnother approach: looking for a mathematical relationship between input elements and their positions in the output. For example, each element in the input appears multiple times in the output, possibly in a symmetrical arrangement.\n\nIn Example0, the output includes elements 8 and 6 arranged in a symmetrical pattern. Similarly, Example1's output has 7s and 8s arranged symmetrically. Example2's output has 6s, 9s, and 4s arranged in a more complex symmetry.\n\nAlternatively, the output matrix is a magic square or has some symmetry properties. But I'm not sure.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and the lack of progress on Example2, perhaps I should try to formulate a general rule based on the first two examples and see if it can be applied to the test input.\n\nAssuming the pattern is:\n\nFor each row in the input, create a new row by appending its reverse. Then, duplicate each new row. Then, append the vertical flip of these new rows, also duplicated. This works for Examples0 and 1.\n\nTest Input is:\n\n[1,4,1]\n\n[4,9,4]\n\n[9,1,9]\n\nApplying this pattern:\n\nFirst, append each row's reverse:\n\nRow0: [1,4,1] reversed is [1,4,1], so new row is [1,4,1,1,4,1].\n\nRow1: [4,9,4] reversed is [4,9,4], new row is [4,9,4,4,9,4].\n\nRow2: [9,1,9] reversed is [9,1,9], new row is [9,1,9,9,1,9].\n\nThen duplicate each new row:\n\nRow0: [1,4,1,1,4,1] twice.\n\nRow1: [4,9,4,4,9,4] twice.\n\nRow2: [9,1,9,9,1,9] twice.\n\nThen vertical flip of these new rows (reverse the order of the rows) and duplicate each:\n\nVertical flip would be rows in reverse order:\n\nRow0: [9,1,9,9,1,9]\n\nRow1: [4,9,4,4,9,4]\n\nRow2: [1,4,1,1,4,1]\n\nEach duplicated.\n\nSo the output would be:\n\nOriginal part:\n\n[1,4,1,1,4,1]\n\n[1,4,1,1,4,1]\n\n[4,9,4,4,9,4]\n\n[4,9,4,4,9,4]\n\n[9,1,9,9,1,9]\n\n[9,1,9,9,1,9]\n\nVertical flip part:\n\n[9,1,9,9,1,9]\n\n[9,1,9,9,1,9]\n\n[4,9,4,4,9,4]\n\n[4,9,4,4,9,4]\n\n[1,4,1,1,4,1]\n\n[1,4,1,1,4,1]\n\nSo combining them:\n\nTotal output would have 12 rows. But the test input is 3x3, and the output should be 6x6. So this approach would produce 12 rows, which is incorrect. Therefore, the pattern must be different.\n\nGiven that Example2's output is different and doesn't fit the earlier pattern, perhaps the pattern involves a more complex transformation. Let's look for another approach.\n\nLooking at Example2's output:\n\nRow0:6,9,9,6,6,6 \u2192 input row0 followed by 6,6,6. The 6s could be the first element of row0 (6) repeated three times. \n\nRow1:6,4,4,4,4,9 \u2192 input row1 followed by 4,4,9. The 4s are the second and third elements of row1 (4,4), and 9 is the last element of row0.\n\nRow2: same as row1.\n\nRow3:9,4,4,4,4,6 \u2192 starts with 9 (last element of row0), then 4,4,4,4,6 (first element of row0).\n\nRow4: same as row3.\n\nRow5:6,6,6,9,9,6 \u2192 6,6,6 (first element of row0), then 9,9,6 (elements from row0).\n\nThis suggests that each output row combines elements from the original row and elements from other rows, perhaps from the mirrored positions. For example:\n\n- For each original row, the first part is the row itself, and the second part is the mirrored elements from the matrix.\n\nFor example, row0's appended part could be the first elements of each row in reverse order. In Example2, row0's appended part is 6,6,6. The first elements of the input rows are 6,6,6. Reversed order would still be 6,6,6. So appended to row0 gives [6,9,9,6,6,6], which matches. \n\nRow1's appended part is 4,4,9. The first elements of the input rows are 6,6,6. If we take the second elements of the rows: 9 (row0),4 (row1),4 (row2). Reversed order would be 4,4,9. Appending to row1 gives [6,4,4,4,4,9], which matches row1.\n\nRow2's appended part is same as row1's, because row2 is the same as row1.\n\nRow3's appended part starts with 9, which is the last element of row0. Perhaps this is taking the last elements of each row. For row3, the first part is 9 (last element of row0), then the second elements of the rows in reverse order: row2's second element is 4, row1's is 4, row0's is 9. Reversed order would be 9,4,4. Then the appended part would be 4,4,9 \u2192 but row3's appended part is 4,4,6. Hmm, not matching. Alternatively, it's the first elements of the rows in reverse order. For row3, the first part is 9 (last element of row0), then the first elements of rows in reverse order (6,6,6) \u2192 but row3's appended part is 4,4,6. This doesn't fit.\n\nThis approach is getting too convoluted. Given the time I've spent and the need to provide an answer, perhaps I should focus on the test input and try to apply the pattern from Example2.\n\nTest Input:\n\n[1,4,1]\n\n[4,9,4]\n\n[9,1,9]\n\nAssuming that the pattern involves appending to each row a combination of elements from other rows. For example, row0's appended part is the first elements of each row. Input rows' first elements are 1,4,9. Reversed, they are 9,4,1. Appending to row0 [1,4,1] gives [1,4,1,9,4,1]. But this doesn't match the example patterns. Alternatively, take the first elements of each column. Columns of input are [1,4,9], [4,9,1], [1,4,9]. Reversed columns might give [9,4,1], [1,9,4], [9,4,1]. So appending column reversed to each row?\n\nAlternatively, let's try to apply the pattern from Example2 to the test input.\n\nExample2's input is:\n\nRow0:6,9,9\n\nRow1:6,4,4\n\nRow2:6,4,4\n\nOutput rows:\n\nRow0:6,9,9,6,6,6 \u2192 row0 + 6,6,6 (first element of row0 thrice)\n\nRow1:6,4,4,4,4,9 \u2192 row1 + 4,4,9 (elements from row1's elements 4,4 and row0's 9)\n\nRow2: same as row1.\n\nRow3:9,4,4,4,4,6 \u2192 starts with 9 (row0's last element), then 4,4,4,4 (from row1 and 2's elements), then 6 (row0's first element)\n\nRow4: same as row3.\n\nRow5:6,6,6,9,9,6 \u2192 three 6s (row0's first element) + row0's last two elements and 6.\n\nApplying this pattern to the test input:\n\nTest input rows:\n\nRow0:1,4,1\n\nRow1:4,9,4\n\nRow2:9,1,9\n\nFollowing Example2's pattern:\n\nRow0 of output would be row0 (1,4,1) + 1,1,1 (first element of row0 thrice) \u2192 [1,4,1,1,1,1]\n\nBut in Example2, row0's appended part is three of the first element. So for test input's row0, appended part is 1,1,1. So output row0: [1,4,1,1,1,1]\n\nRow1 of input is [4,9,4]. Appended part would be 4,4,9. Because in Example2's row1, the appended part was 4,4,9 (elements from row1's 4,4 and row0's 9). So here, row1's elements are 4,9,4. So appended part would be 4,4,9 (elements from row1's first two elements 4,4? No, row1 is [4,9,4]. The first two elements are 4 and 9. But in Example2, row1's appended part was 4,4,9. So perhaps in the test case, appended part for row1 would be 4,4,1 (since row0's last element is 1). Wait, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, appended part is the same as in Example2: take the first element of row1 (4) repeated twice and the last element of row0 (1). So appended part is 4,4,1. So row1 becomes [4,9,4,4,4,1].\n\nRow2 of input is [9,1,9], which is the same as row0's mirror. Following Example2's pattern, row2 would have the same appended part as row1, so [4,4,1], making row2's output [9,1,9,4,4,1].\n\nThen, the vertical flip part would start with the last element of row0 (1) followed by elements from row1 and row2, and end with row0's first element (1).\n\nRow3:1,9,9,4,4,4 \u2192 no, this is unclear.\n\nThis approach is too speculative. Given the time constraints, perhaps I should proceed with the initial pattern observed in Examples0 and 1, even though Example2 doesn't fit, and apply it to the test input.\n\nAssuming the pattern is to create a larger matrix by concatenating the original matrix with its horizontal flip, then the vertical flip with the vertical flip of horizontal flip, and each row is duplicated.\n\nFor the test input:\n\nOriginal matrix:\n\n1 4 1\n\n4 9 4\n\n9 1 9\n\nHorizontal flip (each row reversed):\n\n1 4 1 \u2192 [1,4,1] reversed is [1,4,1]\n\n4 9 4 \u2192 [4,9,4] reversed is [4,9,4]\n\n9 1 9 \u2192 [9,1,9] reversed is [9,1,9]\n\nSo horizontal flip is the same as original because the rows are palindromes.\n\nVertical flip (rows reversed):\n\nRow0:9 1 9\n\nRow1:4 9 4\n\nRow2:1 4 1\n\nVertical flip of horizontal flip (vertical flip of horizontal flip matrix, which is same as original, so vertical flip is the same as above).\n\nSo concatenating original and horizontal flip (which are the same) for each row:\n\nRow0:1 4 1 1 4 1 \u2192 [1,4,1,1,4,1]\n\nRow1:4 9 4 4 9 4 \u2192 [4,9,4,4,9,4]\n\nRow2:9 1 9 9 1 9 \u2192 [9,1,9,9,1,9]\n\nThen vertical flip and vertical flip of horizontal flip:\n\nRow0 of vertical flip:9 1 9 9 1 9 \u2192 [9,1,9,9,1,9]\n\nRow1:4 9 4 4 9 4 \u2192 [4,9,4,4,9,4]\n\nRow2:1 4 1 1 4 1 \u2192 [1,4,1,1,4,1]\n\nSo the output would be:\n\nOriginal part:\n\n[1,4,1,1,4,1]\n\n[4,9,4,4,9,4]\n\n[9,1,9,9,1,9]\n\nVertical flip part:\n\n[9,1,9,9,1,9]\n\n[4,9,4,4,9,4]\n\n[1,4,1,1,4,1]\n\nEach row is duplicated twice. So the final output would be:\n\n[1,4,1,1,4,1]\n\n[1,4,1,1,4,1]\n\n[4,9,4,4,9,4]\n\n[4,9,4,4,9,4]\n\n[9,1,9,9,1,9]\n\n[9,1,9,9,1,9]\n\n[9,1,9,9,1,9]\n\n[9,1,9,9,1,9]\n\n[4,9,4,4,9,4]\n\n[4,9,4,4,9,4]\n\n[1,4,1,1,4,1]\n\n[1,4,1,1,4,1]\n\nBut this gives 12 rows, which doesn't fit the required 6x6 output. Therefore, perhaps each of the original and vertical flip rows are written once. So combining them without duplication would result in 6 rows:\n\n[1,4,1,1,4,1]\n\n[4,9,4,4,9,4]\n\n[9,1,9,9,1,9]\n\n[9,1,9,9,1,9]\n\n[4,9,4,4,9,4]\n\n[1,4,1,1,4,1]\n\nBut this doesn't match any of the training examples' structures, especially Example2. This suggests that the initial pattern may not apply to the test input, and perhaps the correct pattern is different.\n\nGiven that time is limited and the need to provide an answer, perhaps the correct approach is to mirror the input matrix both horizontally and vertically, creating a 2x2 grid of the original, horizontal flip, vertical flip, and vertical-horizontal flip, and each row is duplicated. For the test input, since all rows are palindromes, the output would be:\n\nOriginal | Original (since horizontal flip is same)\n\nVertical Flip | Vertical Flip (since horizontal flip of vertical flip is same as vertical flip)\n\nEach row is duplicated.\n\nSo the output would be:\n\nRow0: [1,4,1,1,4,1]\n\nRow1: [1,4,1,1,4,1]\n\nRow2: [4,9,4,4,9,4]\n\nRow3: [4,9,4,4,9,4]\n\nRow4: [9,1,9,9,1,9]\n\nRow5: [9,1,9,9,1,9]\n\nThis matches the structure of Example1's output, where each transformed row is duplicated. Since the test input's rows are palindromes, this would be the case. Therefore, the final output should be as above.",

        "cot_2": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. So, we have these training examples where each input is a matrix (like a list of lists), and the output is another matrix. My goal is to find out how the input is transformed into the output so I can apply the same logic to the test input.\n\nLet me start by looking at the first example, Example 0.\n\nInput:\n[8, 6]\n[6, 8]\n\nOutput:\n[8, 6, 6, 8]\n[6, 8, 8, 6]\n[6, 8, 8, 6]\n[8, 6, 6, 8]\n\nHmm. The original input is a 2x2 matrix. The output is a 4x4 matrix. So the size is doubled. Let's see how each row is transformed. The first row of the input is [8,6]. In the output, the first row is [8,6,6,8]. Wait, that looks like the original row followed by its reverse. Because reversing [8,6] gives [6,8], so combining them makes [8,6,6,8]. Similarly, the second input row is [6,8], reversed would be [8,6], so combining gives [6,8,8,6]. But the output has four rows. Let's see the output rows:\n\nRow 0: [8,6,6,8] (input row 0 + reversed row 0)\nRow 1: [6,8,8,6] (input row 1 + reversed row 1)\nRow 2: [6,8,8,6] (same as row 1)\nRow 3: [8,6,6,8] (same as row 0)\n\nWait, so maybe each row in the input is duplicated in the output, but the first two output rows are the original and reversed, then the next two are the same as the second row's original and reversed? Or maybe the output is a combination of the original matrix and its mirror. Let me think. The input is 2x2. The output is 4x4. So each dimension is doubled. Maybe each element in the input is expanded into a 2x2 block in the output. Let's see.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is created by mirroring the input matrix both horizontally and vertically. Let's see. For example 0, the input is:\n\nRow 0: 8,6\nRow 1:6,8\n\nIf we mirror horizontally, each row becomes reversed. Then if we mirror vertically, the rows are reversed. So combining them, perhaps the output is a combination of the original matrix, mirrored horizontally, mirrored vertically, and both. But let's check.\n\nOriginal matrix:\n\n8 6\n6 8\n\nMirror horizontally (reverse each row):\n\n6 8\n8 6\n\nMirror vertically (reverse the order of rows):\n\n6 8\n8 6 becomes (when mirrored vertically) same as original since it's symmetric?\n\nWait, maybe not. Let me think again. Another approach: The output matrix might be constructed by taking each row of the input, appending its reverse, then mirroring the entire structure vertically. For example, in Example 0:\n\nOriginal rows:\n[8,6] \u2192 becomes [8,6,6,8] (original + reversed)\n[6,8] \u2192 becomes [6,8,8,6]\n\nThen the output has four rows. The first two rows are these, and the next two are the reversed versions of these two new rows. Wait, but in the output of Example 0, the third row is same as the second, and the fourth same as the first. So maybe the output is created by duplicating each row of the input's transformed row (original + reversed) and then also appending their reversed versions. Hmm, not sure. Let's look at the rows:\n\nAfter transforming each input row into a longer row by appending reversed, the first two output rows would be:\n\n8,6,6,8 (row 0 transformed)\n6,8,8,6 (row 1 transformed)\n\nThen the next two rows are the same as the transformed rows but reversed in order. So rows 2 and 3 are the same as rows 1 and 0 transformed. Wait, but in the example output, rows 2 and 3 are:\n\n[6,8,8,6]\n[8,6,6,8]\n\nWhich are the same as row1 and row0 transformed. So the output is:\n\noriginal_row0_transformed\n\noriginal_row1_transformed\n\noriginal_row1_transformed again?\n\nNo, in example 0, the output rows are:\n\nrow0: transformed row0\n\nrow1: transformed row1\n\nrow2: transformed row1 again?\n\nrow3: transformed row0 again.\n\nSo maybe after creating the transformed rows (original row + reversed), the output is made by taking the transformed rows and then mirroring them vertically. So the output matrix is the transformed rows followed by the reverse of the transformed rows. Wait, in example 0, the transformed rows are:\n\ntransformed row0: [8,6,6,8]\n\ntransformed row1: [6,8,8,6]\n\nThen the output would be these two, followed by reversed list of transformed rows. But the output is four rows. If you reverse the order of the two transformed rows and append them, you get four rows. For example:\n\noriginal transformed rows:\n\nrow0: [8,6,6,8]\n\nrow1: [6,8,8,6]\n\nreverse the order of these rows and append:\n\nrow0: [8,6,6,8]\n\nrow1: [6,8,8,6]\n\nrow2: [6,8,8,6] (original row1 again?)\n\nrow3: [8,6,6,8] (original row0 again?)\n\nBut that's exactly what the output is. So for example 0, the output is the transformed rows (each input row concatenated with its reverse) followed by the same transformed rows in reverse order. Wait, but in this case, the transformed rows are two, so appending their reverse order would give four rows. So the output is [transformed_row0, transformed_row1, transformed_row1, transformed_row0]. Wait, but in the output of example 0, the third row is transformed_row1 again, and the fourth is transformed_row0 again. So that's the case.\n\nSo the pattern for example 0 is:\n\nFor each row in the input, create a new row by appending its reverse. Then, the output matrix is constructed by taking these transformed rows, followed by the same transformed rows in reverse order. Wait, but example 0's input has two rows, the transformed rows are two, and then when reversed, they become row1 and row0. So the output would be [row0, row1, row1, row0]. Which is exactly what the output is.\n\nOkay, that makes sense. Let's check example 1.\n\nExample1 input:\n\n[7,7,8]\n\n[7,7,8]\n\n[8,8,8]\n\nOutput:\n\n[7,7,8,8,7,7]\n\n[7,7,8,8,7,7]\n\n[8,8,8,8,8,8]\n\n[8,8,8,8,8,8]\n\n[7,7,8,8,7,7]\n\n[7,7,8,8,7,7]\n\nSo the input is a 3x3 matrix. The output is 6x6. So again, each dimension is doubled. Let's see how each row is transformed. For each input row, the transformed row is the original row concatenated with its reverse. For example, the first input row is [7,7,8]. Reverse is [8,7,7]. So concatenated gives [7,7,8,8,7,7], which matches the output's first two rows.\n\nThen the third input row is [8,8,8]. Reverse is same, so transformed row is [8,8,8,8,8,8].\n\nSo transformed rows are:\n\nrow0: [7,7,8,8,7,7]\n\nrow1: same as row0\n\nrow2: [8,8,8,8,8,8]\n\nThen the output matrix is these three transformed rows, followed by the reversed order of these three rows. Wait, but the output has six rows. Let's see:\n\nOriginal transformed rows:\n\nrow0, row1, row2 (each of the three input rows transformed)\n\nReversed order would be row2, row1, row0.\n\nSo combining them, the output would be row0, row1, row2, row2, row1, row0. Wait, but the example output's rows are:\n\nrow0: [7,7,8,8,7,7] (transformed row0)\n\nrow1: same as row0 (transformed row1)\n\nrow2: transformed row2\n\nrow3: same as row2\n\nrow4: same as row0\n\nrow5: same as row0.\n\nWait, that doesn't fit. Let me check the actual output.\n\nThe output of example1 is:\n\n[7,7,8,8,7,7]\n\n[7,7,8,8,7,7]\n\n[8,8,8,8,8,8]\n\n[8,8,8,8,8,8]\n\n[7,7,8,8,7,7]\n\n[7,7,8,8,7,7]\n\nSo the first two rows are transformed row0 and row1 (which are the same as input rows 0 and 1, which are same as each other), then rows 2 and 3 are transformed row2 (twice), then rows 4 and 5 are again the transformed rows 0 and 1. Wait, but that's 6 rows, which is double the original 3 rows. So maybe the output is each transformed row followed by itself again. Let's see:\n\nOriginal input rows: 3 rows.\n\nEach transformed row is created by appending reversed. Then, in the output, each transformed row is duplicated (appears twice). So for each input row, there are two copies of the transformed row in the output.\n\nSo input rows:\n\n3 rows \u2192 output 6 rows (each input row contributes two rows).\n\nBut in example1, the output has 6 rows, which is exactly 3 input rows \u00d7 2 each. So transformed_row0 appears twice, transformed_row1 (which is same as transformed_row0) appears twice, transformed_row2 appears twice. Which matches the output. So the pattern here is: for each row in the input, create a new row by appending its reverse, then duplicate that new row once. So each input row becomes two identical rows in the output. Then, arrange them in the same order as the input.\n\nWait, but example0's output is four rows, which is 2 input rows \u00d7 2 each. So in example0, each input row's transformed version is duplicated once. Then, the order is row0, row1, row1, row0. Wait, no. Because example0's output is:\n\n[8,6,6,8] (row0 transformed)\n\n[6,8,8,6] (row1 transformed)\n\n[6,8,8,6] (row1 transformed again)\n\n[8,6,6,8] (row0 transformed again)\n\nSo the output is row0 transformed, row1 transformed, row1 transformed, row0 transformed. So the structure is: original rows transformed, followed by reversed transformed rows. Wait, for example0, the transformed rows are two, then appending the reversed transformed rows (so row1, row0) gives total four. But example1's output is six rows, which would be three transformed rows followed by their reverse (row2, row1, row0), but in the example, the output is:\n\nrow0 transformed \u00d72\n\nrow1 transformed \u00d72 (but same as row0)\n\nrow2 transformed \u00d72\n\nSo the pattern isn't exactly the same. Hmm, this is confusing. Let's check example2.\n\nExample2 input:\n\n[6,9,9]\n\n[6,4,4]\n\n[6,4,4]\n\nOutput:\n\n[6,9,9,6,6,6]\n\n[6,4,4,4,4,9]\n\n[6,4,4,4,4,9]\n\n[9,4,4,4,4,6]\n\n[9,4,4,4,4,6]\n\n[6,6,6,9,9,6]\n\nSo input is 3x3. Output is 6x6. Let's see the transformed rows.\n\nInput row0: [6,9,9]. Reversed would be [9,9,6]. So transformed row would be [6,9,9,9,9,6] but the first output row is [6,9,9,6,6,6]. That's not matching. So maybe the transformation isn't simply appending reversed. So there's a different pattern here.\n\nLooking at the first output row: [6,9,9,6,6,6]. Let's see. The input row0 is [6,9,9]. If we take the original row and then append the reverse of the entire row, but perhaps the first half. Or maybe it's a combination of the row and some other elements.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each element in the input is transformed into a 2x2 block in the output. For example, in example0, the input is 2x2, output 4x4, which is each element expanded to 2x2. But how?\n\nWait, example0's input:\n\n8 6\n\n6 8\n\nOutput:\n\n8 6 6 8\n\n6 8 8 6\n\n6 8 8 6\n\n8 6 6 8\n\nLooking at this, each element in the input is part of a 2x2 block. For example, the top-left 8 in the input is in the top-left 2x2 block of the output:\n\n8 6\n\n6 8\n\nBut in the output, the first two rows and first two columns are [8,6] and [6,8]. Then the next two columns are [6,8] and [8,6]. So maybe each element is mirrored. Alternatively, perhaps the output is a combination of the original matrix and its transpose. But example0's input is symmetric (since row0 is [8,6], row1 is [6,8]), so transpose would be same as original. Hmm, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is constructed by mirroring the entire matrix along both axes. For example, the original matrix is 2x2. To create a 4x4 matrix, you mirror it right and down, so each quadrant is the original or a mirrored version.\n\nBut in example0's output:\n\nThe top-left quadrant is original, top-right is original columns reversed, bottom-left is original rows reversed, and bottom-right is original reversed both ways. So:\n\nOriginal matrix:\n\n8 6\n\n6 8\n\nTop-left quadrant (2x2) is original.\n\nTop-right quadrant would be reversed columns: 6 8 \u2192 reversed to 8 6. So top-right is [6,8] reversed as [8,6], making row0: 8,6,6,8 becomes 8,6,6,8? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is the original matrix followed by its horizontal flip, and then vertically flipped for the lower part.\n\nBut I'm getting stuck. Let's look at example2's output.\n\nExample2's input is:\n\nRow0: [6,9,9]\n\nRow1: [6,4,4]\n\nRow2: [6,4,4]\n\nOutput:\n\n[6,9,9,6,6,6]\n\n[6,4,4,4,4,9]\n\n[6,4,4,4,4,9]\n\n[9,4,4,4,4,6]\n\n[9,4,4,4,4,6]\n\n[6,6,6,9,9,6]\n\nLooking at row0 of output: [6,9,9,6,6,6]. The input row0 is [6,9,9]. The output row0 starts with 6,9,9, then followed by 6,6,6. Where does that come from? The first three elements are the original row0, then the next three elements are [6,6,6]. How is this derived?\n\nAlternatively, maybe each element in the input is expanded into two elements in the output row. For example, each element in the input row is duplicated and mirrored. But for row0: 6 becomes 6,6? But the output row0 starts with 6,9,9 followed by 6,6,6. So 6 is expanded into 6,6, 9 into 9,9, then another 6,6. Not sure.\n\nLooking at row1 of input: [6,4,4]. Output rows1 and 2 are [6,4,4,4,4,9] and same again. So the original row is 6,4,4. Then followed by 4,4,9. Where does 4,4,9 come from? The input row is [6,4,4], reversed is [4,4,6]. But adding reversed would give 6,4,4,4,4,6. But the output row is 6,4,4,4,4,9. So the last element is 9 instead of 6. Hmm, that's confusing. How does the 9 come into play here?\n\nWait, maybe there's a different pattern. Looking at the output of example2:\n\nThe output has 6 rows, each of 6 elements. Let's see if there's a symmetry. The first row is [6,9,9,6,6,6]. The last row is [6,6,6,9,9,6]. Those look like mirror images of each other. Similarly, rows1 and 2 are [6,4,4,4,4,9] and same. Rows3 and 4 are [9,4,4,4,4,6] and same. So perhaps the output is constructed as a mirror of the transformed rows. For example:\n\n- The first three rows are transformed rows of the input, and the next three are the reverse of those transformed rows but with each row itself reversed.\n\nWait, for example, in example2:\n\nTransformed rows (first three):\n\nRow0: [6,9,9,6,6,6]\n\nRow1: [6,4,4,4,4,9]\n\nRow2: [6,4,4,4,4,9]\n\nThen the next three rows are the reversed order of these rows, with each row reversed. So reversed rows would be:\n\nReversed row0: [6,6,6,9,9,6]\n\nReversed row1: [9,4,4,4,4,6]\n\nReversed row2: [9,4,4,4,4,6]\n\nThen the output would be:\n\nRow3: reversed row2 \u2192 [9,4,4,4,4,6]\n\nRow4: reversed row1 \u2192 [9,4,4,4,4,6]\n\nRow5: reversed row0 \u2192 [6,6,6,9,9,6]\n\nWhich matches the output of example2. So the pattern here is:\n\nFor each input row, create a transformed row by appending some elements. Then, the output is the transformed rows followed by the reverse of each transformed row (each row reversed), in reverse order. \n\nSo the process is:\n\n1. For each input row, create a new row (transformed row) by some transformation.\n\n2. Collect all transformed rows into a list.\n\n3. Create another list by taking the transformed rows in reverse order and reversing each row.\n\n4. Concatenate the original transformed rows and this new list to form the output.\n\nBut how is the transformed row generated?\n\nIn example0, transformed row0 is original row + reversed row.\n\nIn example1, transformed row0 is original row + reversed row. For example, input row0 [7,7,8] reversed is [8,7,7], so transformed row is [7,7,8,8,7,7], which matches the output. Then in example1, each transformed row is duplicated, which seems to be because the input has three rows, and the output has six rows (each transformed row appears twice). Wait, but in example1, the input has three rows, each transformed row is duplicated once, leading to 3\u00d72=6 rows. Then, perhaps the output is transformed rows followed by their reversed and reversed order. But in example1's output, the last three rows are duplicates of the first three, but not reversed. Hmm, this is conflicting.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each input row is transformed into two rows in the output. For example0, each input row contributes two rows. So 2 rows \u00d7 2 =4 rows. In example1, 3 rows \u00d72=6 rows. Example2's output has 6 rows, which is 3\u00d72=6. So for each input row, there are two rows in the output. How are these two rows generated?\n\nLooking at example2:\n\nInput row0: [6,9,9] \u2192 output row0 and row5.\n\nRow0: [6,9,9,6,6,6]\n\nRow5: [6,6,6,9,9,6]\n\nThese two rows are the transformed row0 and its reverse.\n\nSimilarly, input row1: [6,4,4] \u2192 output rows1 and row4.\n\nRow1: [6,4,4,4,4,9]\n\nRow4: [9,4,4,4,4,6]\n\nWhich is row1 transformed and its reverse.\n\nInput row2: [6,4,4] \u2192 output rows2 and row3.\n\nRow2: [6,4,4,4,4,9] (same as row1)\n\nRow3: [9,4,4,4,4,6] (same as row4)\n\nSo the pattern here is that for each input row, the output has two rows: one is the transformed row (original + something), and the other is the reverse of the transformed row. Then, the output is arranged in the order of the input rows followed by the reversed transformed rows in reverse order.\n\nWait, in example2, the output is:\n\nTransformed rows for input row0 \u2192 row0 and row5.\n\nTransformed rows for input row1 \u2192 row1 and row4.\n\nTransformed rows for input row2 \u2192 row2 and row3.\n\nBut the order in the output is:\n\nrow0, row1, row2, row3, row4, row5.\n\nWhich is original transformed rows (row0, row1, row2) followed by reversed transformed rows (row3 is reversed row2, row4 is reversed row1, row5 is reversed row0). So the first half of the output is the transformed rows of the input in order, and the second half is the reversed transformed rows in reverse order. \n\nSo for example0, input has two rows:\n\ntransformed rows: row0 and row1.\n\nThen the output is row0, row1, reversed row1, reversed row0. Wait, no, because the output for example0 is:\n\nrow0: transformed row0\n\nrow1: transformed row1\n\nrow2: transformed row1 again?\n\nWait, no. Let me re-examine example0's output:\n\nOutput is:\n\n[8,6,6,8] \u2192 row0 transformed\n\n[6,8,8,6] \u2192 row1 transformed\n\n[6,8,8,6] \u2192 same as row1 transformed\n\n[8,6,6,8] \u2192 same as row0 transformed\n\nHmm, this is conflicting with the earlier examples. But in example2, the output is transformed rows followed by reversed transformed rows in reverse order. So for example2, first three rows are transformed row0, row1, row2. Then the next three rows are reversed row2, reversed row1, reversed row0. But example2's output after row2 is:\n\nrow3: [9,4,4,4,4,6] \u2192 which is reversed row2's transformed row.\n\nrow4: same as row3.\n\nrow5: reversed row0's transformed row.\n\nSo in example2, the first three rows are transformed rows, the next three are reversed versions of the transformed rows but in reverse order. So row3 is reversed row2, row4 is reversed row1, row5 is reversed row0.\n\nBut how are the transformed rows generated?\n\nLooking at example0:\n\nInput row0: [8,6]. Transformed row0 is [8,6,6,8], which is the original row followed by reversed row.\n\nSimilarly, input row1: [6,8]. Transformed row1 is [6,8,8,6], original plus reversed.\n\nThen, the output is:\n\nrow0: transformed row0\n\nrow1: transformed row1\n\nrow2: transformed row1\n\nrow3: transformed row0\n\nWhich doesn't fit the pattern of example2. So there's inconsistency here. Maybe the pattern is different in each example. That can't be. There must be a common pattern.\n\nWait, perhaps the transformed row is created by appending the reverse of the row and then the reverse of the entire matrix. Or maybe the transformed row is original row concatenated with the reverse of the row. Then, the output matrix is created by appending the transformed matrix and its vertical mirror. Let's see.\n\nFor example0:\n\nOriginal matrix after transformation (each row is original + reversed):\n\nrow0: [8,6,6,8]\n\nrow1: [6,8,8,6]\n\nThen vertical mirror (reverse the order of rows):\n\nrow1, row0.\n\nSo combining, the output is:\n\nrow0\n\nrow1\n\nrow1\n\nrow0\n\nWhich is the case in example0.\n\nFor example1:\n\nTransformed matrix:\n\nrow0: [7,7,8,8,7,7]\n\nrow1: [7,7,8,8,7,7]\n\nrow2: [8,8,8,8,8,8]\n\nVertical mirror is row2, row1, row0.\n\nSo combining, the output would be:\n\nrow0, row1, row2, row2, row1, row0.\n\nWhich matches example1's output.\n\nFor example2:\n\nTransformed rows:\n\nrow0: [6,9,9,6,6,6]\n\nrow1: [6,4,4,4,4,9]\n\nrow2: [6,4,4,4,4,9]\n\nVertical mirror would be row2, row1, row0.\n\nAppending the vertical mirror's transformed rows (each reversed):\n\nEach row in the vertical mirror is row2, row1, row0. So their transformed rows would be reversed versions.\n\nWait, maybe the output is the transformed matrix followed by the vertical mirror of the transformed matrix. But for example0, the vertical mirror of the transformed matrix (rows row0 and row1) would be row1, row0. So the output is row0, row1, row1, row0. Which matches example0.\n\nExample1's transformed matrix is three rows: row0, row1, row2. Vertical mirror is row2, row1, row0. So output is row0, row1, row2, row2, row1, row0. Which matches example1.\n\nExample2's transformed matrix:\n\nrow0: [6,9,9,6,6,6]\n\nrow1: [6,4,4,4,4,9]\n\nrow2: [6,4,4,4,4,9]\n\nVertical mirror is row2, row1, row0.\n\nSo appending the vertical mirror to the transformed matrix gives:\n\nrow0, row1, row2, row2, row1, row0.\n\nBut in example2's output, the rows after row2 are [9,4,4,4,4,6], [9,4,4,4,4,6], [6,6,6,9,9,6]. Which are reversed versions of the transformed rows. So maybe the vertical mirror is not just the reversed order of the rows, but each row is also reversed.\n\nSo the pattern is: transform each row by appending its reverse, then create a vertical mirror of the transformed matrix by reversing the order of the rows and also reversing each individual row.\n\nSo for example0:\n\nTransformed matrix rows:\n\nrow0: [8,6,6,8]\n\nrow1: [6,8,8,6]\n\nVertical mirror (rows reversed and each row reversed):\n\nOriginal vertical mirror (rows reversed) would be row1, row0.\n\nEach row reversed:\n\nrow1 reversed: [6,8,8,6] \u2192 reversed becomes [6,8,8,6] (same as original row1)\n\nrow0 reversed: [8,6,6,8] \u2192 reversed becomes [8,6,6,8] (same as original row0)\n\nSo the vertical mirror part would be row1, row0.\n\nThus, the output is transformed matrix followed by vertical mirror (which for example0 is row1, row0). So the total output is:\n\nrow0, row1, row1, row0. Which matches.\n\nIn example1:\n\nTransformed rows are:\n\nrow0: [7,7,8,8,7,7]\n\nrow1: [7,7,8,8,7,7]\n\nrow2: [8,8,8,8,8,8]\n\nVertical mirror: rows reversed (row2, row1, row0), then each row reversed.\n\nReversed row2: [8,8,8,8,8,8] \u2192 same.\n\nReversed row1: [7,7,8,8,7,7] \u2192 same as row1.\n\nReversed row0: [7,7,8,8,7,7] \u2192 same as row0.\n\nSo vertical mirror part is row2, row1, row0.\n\nAppending to transformed matrix, the output is:\n\nrow0, row1, row2, row2, row1, row0. Which matches example1.\n\nIn example2:\n\nTransformed matrix rows:\n\nrow0: [6,9,9,6,6,6]\n\nrow1: [6,4,4,4,4,9]\n\nrow2: [6,4,4,4,4,9]\n\nVertical mirror part: rows reversed (row2, row1, row0), and each row reversed.\n\nReversed row2: [6,4,4,4,4,9] \u2192 reversed becomes [9,4,4,4,4,6]\n\nReversed row1: [6,4,4,4,4,9] \u2192 reversed becomes [9,4,4,4,4,6]\n\nReversed row0: [6,9,9,6,6,6] \u2192 reversed becomes [6,6,6,9,9,6]\n\nSo the vertical mirror part is:\n\n[9,4,4,4,4,6] (reversed row2)\n\n[9,4,4,4,4,6] (reversed row1)\n\n[6,6,6,9,9,6] (reversed row0)\n\nSo appending this to the transformed matrix gives:\n\nrow0: [6,9,9,6,6,6]\n\nrow1: [6,4,4,4,4,9]\n\nrow2: [6,4,4,4,4,9]\n\nrow3: [9,4,4,4,4,6]\n\nrow4: [9,4,4,4,4,6]\n\nrow5: [6,6,6,9,9,6]\n\nWhich matches example2's output.\n\nSo the overall pattern seems to be:\n\n1. For each row in the input matrix, create a new row by appending the reverse of the original row. This forms the first part of the output matrix.\n\n2. Create the vertical mirror of this transformed matrix by:\n   a. Reversing the order of the rows.\n   b. Reversing each individual row.\n\n3. Concatenate the transformed matrix and its vertical mirror to get the final output.\n\nNow, let's test this pattern against the test input.\n\nTest input:\n\n[1,4,1]\n\n[4,9,4]\n\n[9,1,9]\n\nSo, it's a 3x3 matrix. Let's process each step.\n\nStep 1: Transform each row by appending its reverse.\n\nRow0: [1,4,1] \u2192 reversed is [1,4,1]. So transformed row0 is [1,4,1,1,4,1].\n\nRow1: [4,9,4] \u2192 reversed is [4,9,4]. So transformed row1 is [4,9,4,4,9,4].\n\nRow2: [9,1,9] \u2192 reversed is [9,1,9]. So transformed row2 is [9,1,9,9,1,9].\n\nSo the transformed matrix is:\n\n[1,4,1,1,4,1]\n\n[4,9,4,4,9,4]\n\n[9,1,9,9,1,9]\n\nStep 2: Create the vertical mirror by reversing the order of the rows and reversing each row.\n\nReversed order of the transformed rows: row2, row1, row0.\n\nNow, reverse each of these rows:\n\nReversed row2: [9,1,9,9,1,9] \u2192 reversed becomes [9,1,9,9,1,9] \u2192 same as original.\n\nReversed row1: [4,9,4,4,9,4] \u2192 reversed becomes [4,9,4,4,9,4] \u2192 same as original.\n\nReversed row0: [1,4,1,1,4,1] \u2192 reversed becomes [1,4,1,1,4,1] \u2192 same as original.\n\nSo the vertical mirror part is:\n\n[9,1,9,9,1,9]\n\n[4,9,4,4,9,4]\n\n[1,4,1,1,4,1]\n\nSo the final output is the transformed matrix followed by the vertical mirror:\n\nRow0: [1,4,1,1,4,1]\n\nRow1: [4,9,4,4,9,4]\n\nRow2: [9,1,9,9,1,9]\n\nRow3: [9,1,9,9,1,9]\n\nRow4: [4,9,4,4,9,4]\n\nRow5: [1,4,1,1,4,1]\n\nSo the output should be these six rows.\n\nBut wait, looking at the test input's structure, each row when reversed is the same as the original row. So for example, [1,4,1] reversed is same. So the transformed row is the original row duplicated. So each transformed row is the original row twice. Then the vertical mirror part is same as transformed rows in reverse order. So the output is:\n\n[1,4,1,1,4,1]\n\n[4,9,4,4,9,4]\n\n[9,1,9,9,1,9]\n\n[9,1,9,9,1,9]\n\n[4,9,4,4,9,4]\n\n[1,4,1,1,4,1]\n\nThis should be the correct output."
