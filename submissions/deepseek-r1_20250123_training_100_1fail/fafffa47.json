        "cot_1": "Okay, let's tackle this puzzle. So, I need to figure out the pattern that transforms the input into the output in the training examples, and then apply that pattern to the test input. Let's start by looking at the examples one by one.\n\nLooking at Example 0:\n\nINPUT:\nThree rows of numbers, then another three. The first three rows are:\n[0, 9, 9]\n[0, 9, 9]\n[9, 9, 9]\nThen the next three rows:\n[0, 1, 0]\n[0, 0, 1]\n[1, 1, 1]\n\nOUTPUT:\n[2, 0, 0]\n[2, 0, 0]\n[0, 0, 0]\n\nHmm. Maybe the first three rows and the next three are separate matrices. Like, maybe the first three are one matrix and the next three are another. Then, the output is another matrix. Let's see if combining them in some way gives the output.\n\nLooking at the numbers, maybe the 9s and 0s in the first part are some kind of grid, and the 0s,1s in the second part are another. The output has 2s and 0s. Maybe 2s are where certain conditions are met in both matrices.\n\nAnother thought: perhaps the first three rows are a grid where 9s represent something (like obstacles) and 0s are empty. The next three rows could be another layer. The output might be combining these layers, possibly counting something. But how?\n\nWait, let's look at the positions. For example, in Example 0's input, the first three rows (let's call them part A) and the next three (part B). The output is a 3x3 matrix. Let's check if each position in the output is determined by the corresponding positions in part A and part B.\n\nIn Example 0's output, the first row is [2,0,0]. Let's see the first row of part A: [0,9,9], and part B's first row is [0,1,0]. How does that combine to 2?\n\nWait, maybe the 9s in part A are being replaced by 0s in the output, and the 0s in part A are being combined with part B's values. For example, in the first cell of part A (0) and part B (0). But how does 0 and 0 become 2?\n\nAlternatively, maybe part A is a mask. Wherever part A has 0, look at part B's value. If part B's value is 1, maybe count the number of 1s in some way. Or perhaps part B is a 3x3 grid, and part A is another 3x3 grid. The output could be summing certain aspects.\n\nWait, let's check the positions more carefully. Let's take the first output cell in Example 0: [2,0,0]. The first cell is 2. Let's see the corresponding part A cell is 0, part B cell is 0 (since part B's first row is [0,1,0], so first cell is 0). Hmm, but how does that get to 2?\n\nAlternatively, maybe part A and part B are overlaid, and the output is counting how many times a 9 in part A is adjacent to certain values in part B. Or maybe it's a cellular automaton-like transformation.\n\nAnother approach: maybe the output is derived by some operation between the two 3x3 grids (the first three rows and the next three). Let's see:\n\nIn Example 0, part A (first three rows) has 0s and 9s. Part B has 0s and 1s.\n\nThe output has 2s in positions where maybe the part A cell is 0 and part B cell is 1? But in the first row of part B, there's a 1 in the middle. But the output's first row is [2,0,0]. Wait, maybe it's the sum of part B's cells in some way.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the count of 1s in part B's columns, but adjusted based on part A. Not sure.\n\nWait, let's look at another example. Example 1:\n\nINPUT part A:\n[9, 0, 9]\n[0, 9, 9]\n[0, 0, 9]\n\nPart B:\n[1, 0, 1]\n[1, 0, 0]\n[1, 0, 0]\n\nOUTPUT:\n[0, 2, 0]\n[0, 0, 0]\n[0, 2, 0]\n\nHmm. The output has 2s in positions (0,1) and (2,1). Let's check part A and part B in those positions. For (0,1), part A is 0 and part B is 0. How does that become 2? For (2,1), part A is 0 and part B is 0 again. Hmm, that doesn't make sense. Maybe another approach.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is determined by the sum of the vertical columns in part B. Let's check Example 0's part B:\n\nPart B rows:\n[0,1,0]\n[0,0,1]\n[1,1,1]\n\nColumns would be:\n0+0+1=1, 1+0+1=2, 0+1+1=2. But the output is [2,0,0], [2,0,0], [0,0,0]. Doesn't align.\n\nWait, maybe the output is a 3x3 grid where each cell is 2 if the corresponding cell in part A is 0 and the sum of adjacent cells in part B meets a certain condition. For example, in Example 0, the output's first two rows have 2s. Let's look at part A's first two rows: they have 0s in the first column. Part B's first column has 0,0,1. So sum of part B's first column is 1. But the output's first cell is 2, which might be 1 +1? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the number of times each position in part B is 1, but only where part A is 0, and multiplied by 2. But in Example 0's part B, the sum of 1s is (0+1+0) + (0+0+1) + (1+1+1) = 1 +1 +3 =5. Not sure how that becomes the output.\n\nWait, maybe the output is the sum of the rows in part B, but adjusted. For example, in Example 0's part B:\n\nRow 1: 0,1,0 \u2192 sum 1\nRow 2:0,0,1 \u2192 sum1\nRow3:1,1,1 \u2192 sum3\n\nBut output rows are [2,0,0], [2,0,0], [0,0,0]. So maybe each sum is multiplied by 2 where part A is 0. But the first row of part A is [0,9,9]. So first element is 0, others 9. The output's first row is [2,0,0]. So the sum of part B's first row is 1, multiplied by 2 \u2192 2. The other elements are 0 because part A is 9 there. That fits. Similarly, second row of part A is [0,9,9], so first element 0. Sum of part B's second row is 1 \u2192 2. Third row of part A is [9,9,9], so all 0 in output. That explains Example 0's output.\n\nLet's check Example 1 to see if this holds.\n\nExample 1's part A:\n[9,0,9]\n[0,9,9]\n[0,0,9]\n\nPart B:\n[1,0,1]\n[1,0,0]\n[1,0,0]\n\nSo for each position where part A is 0, take the sum of the corresponding row in part B and multiply by 2? Let's see:\n\nIn part A, the 0s are at (0,1), (1,0), (2,0), (2,1).\n\nFor row 0 in part A, only position 1 is 0. Sum of part B's row 0 is 1+0+1=2. Multiply by 2 \u2192 4? But output row 0 is [0,2,0]. Wait, maybe it's per-cell. Wait, the part B row sum is not the same for each cell. Wait, maybe for each cell in part A that is 0, take the sum of the entire row of part B where the cell is in, multiply by 2?\n\nWait, in Example 0, for part A cell (0,0) which is 0, the sum of part B's row 0 is 0+1+0=1 \u2192 2*1=2. So output cell (0,0) is 2. Similarly, part A cell (1,0) is 0, sum of part B row 1 is 0+0+1=1 \u2192 2. Output cell (1,0) is 2. So yes, for each cell in part A that is 0, the output is 2 multiplied by the sum of the row in part B where that cell is located.\n\nWait, but in Example 1's part A cell (0,1) is 0. The row is part B's row 0, sum is 1+0+1=2. Multiply by 2 \u21924? But the output cell (0,1) is 2. That doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. Maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps for each cell in part A that is 0, the output cell is the sum of the part B's column. Let's check.\n\nIn Example 0, part B's columns:\n\nColumn 0: 0+0+1=1\nColumn 1:1+0+1=2\nColumn2:0+1+1=2\n\nFor part A cell (0,0) which is 0, the column is 0, sum is 1. Output cell (0,0) is 2. So 1*2=2. Similarly, part A cell (1,0) is 0, column 0 sum is 1 \u2192 2. So output cells (0,0) and (1,0) are 2. Which matches Example 0's output.\n\nIn Example 1:\n\nPart B's columns:\n\nColumn 0:1+1+1=3\nColumn 1:0+0+0=0\nColumn2:1+0+0=1\n\nNow, part A's cells that are 0:\n\nAt (0,1), column 1 sum is 0 \u2192 0*2=0. But output cell (0,1) is 2. So that doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. Maybe this isn't the right approach.\n\nAlternative idea: Maybe the output is a grid where each cell is the count of 1s in part B's corresponding row and column, but only where part A's cell is 0.\n\nWait, perhaps for each cell (i,j) in the output:\n\nIf part A's (i,j) is 9, output 0.\n\nIf part A's (i,j) is 0, then output 2 multiplied by the number of 1s in the entire row i of part B.\n\nIn Example 0:\n\nPart A cell (0,0) is 0. Part B row 0 has 1 one. So 2*1=2 \u2192 output (0,0) is 2.\n\nSimilarly, part A (1,0) is 0. Part B row1 has 1 one \u2192 2. So output (1,0) is 2.\n\nOther cells in part A are 9, so output 0. Which matches Example 0's output.\n\nExample 1:\n\nPart A cell (0,1) is 0. Part B row0 has two 1s \u2192 2*2=4. But output cell (0,1) is 2. So that doesn't fit.\n\nHmm, no. So maybe not.\n\nAlternative approach: Maybe the output is determined by part B's cells, but modified based on part A's cells. For example, in positions where part A is 0, the output is 2 times the value in part B. But part B has 0s and 1s. For part B cells that are 1, 2*1=2. But in Example 0's part B, row0 has 1 in middle. Part A's row0 has 0 in first and second positions? Wait, part A's row0 is [0,9,9]. So only the first cell is 0. So part B's row0 first cell is 0. So 0*2=0, but output is 2 there. Hmm, no.\n\nWait, maybe when part A is 0, the output is 2 if the corresponding part B cell is 1, else 0. Let's check Example 0:\n\nPart A cell (0,0) is 0. Part B cell (0,0) is 0 \u2192 output 0. But output's (0,0) is 2. So no.\n\nAnother idea: Maybe the output is the sum of the part B's cells in the same row and column as the current cell, but only where part A is 0. Let's think. For each cell (i,j) where part A is 0, sum all part B cells in row i and column j, then multiply by 2. Let's try Example 0.\n\nFor (0,0) part A is 0. Sum of part B row0 (0+1+0=1) and column0 (0+0+1=1) \u2192 total 2. Multiply by 2 \u21924. Output cell is 2. Doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. Maybe this is getting too complicated. Let's look for a different pattern.\n\nWait, in all the outputs, the numbers are 0, 2. So the output is made of 0s and 2s. How do the inputs relate to that? Let's think of part B as some kind of binary matrix (0s and 1s), and part A as a mask. Perhaps the 2s in the output correspond to positions where part A is 0 and part B has a certain property.\n\nLooking at Example 0's part B:\n\nRow 0:0,1,0 \u2192 sum 1\nRow1:0,0,1 \u2192 sum1\nRow2:1,1,1 \u2192 sum3\n\nBut output rows 0 and 1 are [2,0,0] and [2,0,0]. So maybe the sum of the row in part B is 1, multiplied by 2. For rows 0 and 1, sum is 1 \u2192 2. Row2 sum is 3 \u2192 0. But how does that map to the output cells?\n\nAlternatively, for each cell in part A that's 0, the output is 2 if the sum of the row in part B is 1, else 0. Let's check:\n\nIn Example 0, part A's first row (0,9,9). So only (0,0) is 0. Part B row0 sum is 1 \u2192 so output (0,0) is 2. Part A row1 (0,9,9) \u2192 (1,0) is 0. Part B row1 sum is1 \u2192 output (1,0) is 2. Part A row2 is all 9s \u2192 0s. So output row0 is [2,0,0], row1 [2,0,0], row2 [0,0,0]. Which matches Example 0's output.\n\nLet's test this hypothesis with Example 1.\n\nExample 1's part A:\nRow0:9,0,9 \u2192 (0,1) is 0\nRow1:0,9,9 \u2192 (1,0) is 0\nRow2:0,0,9 \u2192 (2,0) and (2,1) are 0.\n\nPart B:\nRow0:1,0,1 \u2192 sum 2\nRow1:1,0,0 \u2192 sum1\nRow2:1,0,0 \u2192 sum1.\n\nFor part A's (0,1): part B row0 sum is2 \u2192 2 is not 1, so output 0? But the output cell (0,1) is 2. So that doesn't fit. Hmm. So maybe this isn't correct.\n\nAlternative approach: Maybe the output is 2 in positions where part A is 0 and the corresponding part B cell is 1. But let's see.\n\nExample 0's part B:\nRow0:0,1,0 \u2192 (0,1) is 1. But part A's (0,1) is 9. So output (0,1) is 0. Which matches. But part A's (0,0) is 0, part B's (0,0) is 0 \u2192 output (0,0) is 0. But in Example 0's output, (0,0) is 2. So that's not right.\n\nAlternative idea: Maybe the output counts the number of 1s in part B's row and column for cells where part A is 0. For example, in part A (0,0) is 0. Count the number of 1s in part B's row 0 and column 0. Let's see part B row0 has 1 (cell (0,1)), column0 has 0,0,1 \u2192 total 1. So sum 2. Multiply by something. But output cell is 2. So 2*1=2? Hmm. Maybe sum of 1s in row and column for that cell. For (0,0) in Example 0: part B row0 sum is1, column0 sum is1 (0+0+1=1). Total 2. Output is 2. That fits. Let's check Example 1.\n\nExample 1's output cell (0,1) is 2. Part A (0,1) is 0. Part B row0 sum:1+0+1=2. Column1 sum:0+0+0=0. Total 2. So output is 2. Which matches. For part A (1,0) is 0. Part B row1 sum:1+0+0=1. Column0 sum:1+1+1=3. Total 4. But output cell (1,0) is 0. So that doesn't fit. Hmm, so that's not it.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the number of 1s in the same column of part B where part A is 0, multiplied by 2. For Example 0, part A cell (0,0) is 0. Column0 in part B has sum 1. 1*2=2. Which matches. Part A cell (1,0) is 0. Column0 sum is 1 \u2192 2. Output cell (1,0) is 2. For Example 1, part A cell (0,1) is 0. Column1 sum is 0 \u2192 0*2=0, but output is 2. So that doesn't work.\n\nThis is getting tricky. Let's look at another example. Example 2:\n\nINPUT part A:\n[0,9,0]\n[9,0,9]\n[9,0,0]\n\nPart B:\n[0,0,0]\n[0,0,1]\n[1,0,0]\n\nOUTPUT:\n[2,0,2]\n[0,2,0]\n[0,2,2]\n\nSo part A has 0s at (0,0), (0,2), (1,1), (2,1), (2,2).\n\nFor each of these positions:\n\nLet's look at the corresponding part B's column.\n\n- (0,0): column0 sum is0 (part B rows:0,0,1 \u2192 0+0+1=1. Wait, part B's rows are:\n\nRow0:0,0,0\n\nRow1:0,0,1\n\nRow2:1,0,0\n\nSo column0 is 0 (row0) +0 (row1) +1 (row2) \u2192 sum=1. So 1*2=2. Output cell (0,0) is 2. That works.\n\nCell (0,2): column2 sum is0 (row0) +1 (row1) +0 (row2) \u2192 sum1. 1*2=2. Output cell (0,2) is 2. Correct.\n\nCell (1,1): column1 sum is0 (row0) +0 (row1) +0 (row2) \u2192 0. 0*2=0. But output cell (1,1) is 2. Hmm, discrepancy. So this idea is invalid.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's the sum of the part B's row where the cell is located. For example, part A cell (0,0) is 0. Part B row0 sum is0. So 0*2=0. But output is 2. So that's not it.\n\nWait, maybe the sum of part B's entire matrix? Example 0's part B has sum 1+1+3=5. Output sum is 2+2 =4. Not matching.\n\nAlternative approach: Let's look for a pattern in the output's 2s. For Example 0's output, the 2s are in the first column, first two rows. Part A's first column is 0,0,9. Part B's first column is 0,0,1. So maybe where part A's cell is 0 and part B's cell in the same row and column has 1. Wait, part B's first column in Example 0: row0 is 0, row1 is 0, row2 is 1. So part A's cell (0,0) is 0, part B's cell (0,0) is 0. Output is 2. So that doesn't fit. Hmm.\n\nAnother idea: Maybe the output counts the number of 1s in the 3x3 part B grid, and for each cell in part A that is 0, the output is 2 times the number of 1s in part B. But in Example 0, part B has 5 1s. So 5*2=10. But the output has 4 2s, totaling 8. Doesn't match.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is 2 where part A is 0 and part B has exactly two 1s in the corresponding row and column. Not sure.\n\nWait, let's think about the output's structure. The output is a 3x3 grid. Each cell is 0 or 2. The input is two 3x3 grids (part A and part B). Let's think of part A as a mask: where part A is 0, some operation is done on part B to determine if it's 2 or 0.\n\nIn Example 0, part B has a 1 in the middle of row0. Part A's row0 first cell is 0. Output here is 2. But part B's cell is 0. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's the sum of the column in part B where the cell in part A is 0, multiplied by 2. For Example 0's (0,0) cell: column0 sum is 0+0+1=1 \u2192 2*1=2. Correct. For (1,0) cell: same column sum, so 2. Correct. In Example 1's (0,1) cell: column1 sum is0 \u2192 0. But output is 2. So no.\n\nThis is challenging. Let's try to find another angle. Let's look at the test input and see if we can find any patterns that fit the training examples.\n\nTest Input:\n\nPart A (first three rows):\n[9, 0, 9]\n[0, 0, 9]\n[9, 0, 9]\n\nPart B (next three rows):\n[0, 1, 1]\n[0, 1, 0]\n[1, 0, 0]\n\nSo part A has 0s at positions (0,1), (1,0), (1,1), (2,1).\n\nFor each of these positions, we need to compute the output value (2 or 0) based on part B's data.\n\nLet's see the output for the test case. If the pattern holds from the training examples, perhaps the output is determined by the sum of the part B's column for each cell where part A is 0. For example, for (0,1) in part A, column1 in part B has 1 (from row0) +1 (row1) +0 (row2) \u2192 sum 2. Multiply by 2 \u21924. But the output can only be 0 or 2. So maybe it's the sum modulo something.\n\nAlternatively, for each cell (i,j) where part A is 0, output 2 if the corresponding part B's cell (i,j) is 1. But in the test input's part B:\n\n(0,1) is 1 \u2192 output 2.\n(1,0) is 0 \u2192 output 0.\n(1,1) is 1 \u2192 output 2.\n(2,1) is 0 \u2192 output 0.\n\nSo the output would be:\n\nRow0: [0,2,0]\nRow1: [0,2,0]\nRow2: [0,0,0]\n\nBut looking at the training examples, let's see if this holds.\n\nExample 0's part B:\n\nCells where part A is 0 are (0,0) and (1,0). Part B cells are 0 and 0. So output would be [0,0,0] for those, but the output is 2s. So this doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. Not matching.\n\nAlternative idea: Maybe for each cell in part A that is 0, the output is 2 if the sum of the adjacent cells (including diagonally) in part B is exactly 1. Let's check Example 0:\n\nPart A (0,0) is 0. Adjacent cells in part B (which is part B's grid) would be (0,0) is part of part B's first row. Wait, maybe part B is a separate grid, not the same positions. Maybe the adjacency is within part B's grid.\n\nBut I'm getting stuck. Let's try to see if there's another approach. Perhaps the output is a transformation of part B based on part A. For example, wherever part A is 9, the output is 0. Where part A is 0, the output is 2 multiplied by the number of 1s in part B's same row.\n\nLet's test Example 0 again:\n\nFor part A cells that are 0: (0,0), (1,0).\n\nRow0 of part B has one 1 \u2192 2*1=2 \u2192 output (0,0) is 2.\n\nRow1 of part B has one 1 \u2192 output (1,0) is 2.\n\nOther cells in part A are 9 \u2192 0. So output matches Example 0.\n\nExample 1:\n\nPart A cells are (0,1), (1,0), (2,0), (2,1).\n\nRow0 of part B has two 1s \u2192 2*2=4 \u2192 output (0,1) is 4? But output is 2. No.\n\nHmm. Doesn't fit.\n\nAlternative approach: Maybe the output is 2 where part A is 0 and the sum of the entire part B matrix is even or odd. But Example 0's part B has sum 5 (odd), and output has 4 2s (even). Not sure.\n\nWait, let's look at the test input's part B:\n\nRow0:0,1,1 \u2192 sum2.\n\nRow1:0,1,0 \u2192 sum1.\n\nRow2:1,0,0 \u2192 sum1.\n\nTotal sum is 4. So even.\n\nIf the output is 2 for each 0 in part A when the sum of part B is even. But how would that apply per cell?\n\nNot sure. Let's think differently. Let's see the output for Example 3:\n\nINPUT part A:\n[0,0,9]\n[9,9,9]\n[0,9,0]\n\nPart B:\n[1,0,0]\n[0,1,1]\n[0,0,1]\n\nOUTPUT:\n[0,2,0]\n[0,0,0]\n[2,0,0]\n\nPart A has 0s at (0,0), (0,1), (2,0), (2,2).\n\nPart B's row sums:\n\nRow0:1 \u2192 sum1.\n\nRow1:2 \u2192 sum2.\n\nRow2:1 \u2192 sum1.\n\nFor each part A cell that's 0:\n\n(0,0): row0 sum1 \u2192 2*1=2. But output is 0.\n\n(0,1): row0 sum1 \u2192 2. Output is 2.\n\n(2,0): row2 sum1 \u2192 2. Output is 2.\n\n(2,2): row2 sum1 \u2192 2. Output is 0.\n\nSo this doesn't fit. So previous ideas aren't working.\n\nAlternative plan: Let's try to find the pattern for each cell in the output by comparing the input and output across examples.\n\nFor example, in Example 0:\n\nOutput cell (0,0) is 2. Part A (0,0) is 0. Part B (0,0) is 0.\n\nBut how? Maybe the sum of part B's row and column where part A is 0.\n\nWait, for Example 0's cell (0,0):\n\nSum of part B's row0:0+1+0=1.\n\nSum of part B's column0:0+0+1=1.\n\nTotal sum 2. Output is 2. That matches.\n\nExample 0's cell (1,0):\n\nSum of part B's row1:0+0+1=1.\n\nSum of column0:0+0+1=1.\n\nTotal 2 \u2192 output 2.\n\nExample 1's cell (0,1):\n\nSum of part B's row0:1+0+1=2.\n\nSum of column1:0+0+0=0.\n\nTotal 2 \u2192 output 2. Which matches.\n\nExample 1's cell (2,1):\n\nSum of row2:1+0+0=1.\n\nSum of column1:0 \u2192 total1. Output is 0. But the output for cell (2,1) is 2. So no.\n\nHmm, inconsistency.\n\nAnother idea: Maybe for each cell where part A is 0, output is 2 if the sum of part B's row and column (excluding the current cell) is even.\n\nBut this is getting too vague. Let's look for a different pattern.\n\nWait, perhaps part A is a mask where 0s indicate that the corresponding cell in part B should be counted in a certain way. For example, the output is 2 multiplied by the number of 1s in part B's cells that are in the same row and column as part A's 0 cells. But this is vague.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider that part A and part B are stacked, and the output is some kind of transformation. For example, part A's 0s are areas where we look for certain patterns in part B.\n\nWait, in Example 0's output, the first two rows have 2s in the first column. Part B's first column has 0,0,1. The sum is 1. Multiply by 2 to get 2. But how does that apply to each cell.\n\nAlternatively, for each cell in part A that is 0, the output is 2 times the number of 1s in part B's entire matrix. But that would be the same for all cells. For Example 0, part B has 5 ones. 5*2=10, which doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, the output is the sum of the part B's values in the same row as the part A's 0 cell, multiplied by 2. So, for each cell (i,j) in part A that is 0, output[i][j] = 2 * sum of part B's row i.\n\nExample 0:\n\nFor cell (0,0) in part A, part B row0 sum is 0+1+0=1 \u2192 2*1=2. Output is 2. Correct.\n\nCell (1,0): part B row1 sum 0+0+1=1 \u2192 2. Correct.\n\nExample 1:\n\nCell (0,1): part B row0 sum 1+0+1=2 \u2192 4. Output is 2. So no.\n\nHmm. Not matching.\n\nAnother angle: Maybe part B is a binary representation of something. For example, each row in part B is a binary number, and the output is the decimal value multiplied by 2. Let's see:\n\nExample 0's part B rows:\n\nRow0:0,1,0 \u2192 binary 010 = 2 \u2192 2*2=4. But output row0 is [2,0,0]. Doesn't fit.\n\nExample 1's part B row0:1,0,1 \u21925 \u2192 10. Output row0 is [0,2,0]. No.\n\nNot matching.\n\nLet me try to look for a different pattern. Let's compare the positions of 0s in part A and the output 2s.\n\nIn Example 0, part A's 0s are (0,0), (1,0), (0,0) and (1,0) in the first two rows. Output's 2s are in (0,0) and (1,0), matching.\n\nIn Example 1, part A's 0s are (0,1), (1,0), (2,0), (2,1). Output's 2s are (0,1), (2,1). So only two of the four part A 0s become 2. So the presence of a 0 in part A is necessary but not sufficient. There must be another condition based on part B.\n\nLooking at Example 1's output 2s:\n\n(0,1) and (2,1). For these positions:\n\nPart B's (0,1) is 0.\n\nPart B's (2,1) is 0.\n\nHmm, not sure. Maybe the columns in part B.\n\nFor Example 1's output 2s:\n\nColumn1 has sum 0 in part B. But output is 2. So maybe when the column in part B has a certain sum.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is 2 if the part B's cell in the same position as part A's 0 is 0. But in Example 0, part B's (0,0) is 0 \u2192 output 2. Part B's (1,0) is 0 \u2192 output 2. Example 1's (0,1) part B is 0 \u2192 output 2. (2,1) part B is 0 \u2192 output 2. So this fits Examples 0, 1, and 2.\n\nLet's test this hypothesis:\n\nFor any cell (i,j) in part A that is 0, if part B's cell (i,j) is 0, output 2. Else, output 0.\n\nExample 0:\n\nPart A 0s are (0,0), (1,0). Part B's (0,0) is 0 \u2192 output 2. Part B's (1,0) is 0 \u2192 output 2. Other cells are 9 \u2192 0. Which matches.\n\nExample 1:\n\nPart A 0s are (0,1), (1,0), (2,0), (2,1).\n\nPart B's (0,1) is 0 \u2192 output 2.\n\nPart B's (1,0) is 1 \u2192 output 0.\n\nPart B's (2,0) is 1 \u2192 output 0.\n\nPart B's (2,1) is 0 \u2192 output 2.\n\nSo output 2s at (0,1) and (2,1), which matches Example 1's output.\n\nExample 2's output has 2s in various positions. Let's check:\n\nPart A 0s are (0,0), (0,2), (1,1), (2,1), (2,2).\n\nPart B's cells:\n\n(0,0):0 \u2192 output 2.\n\n(0,2):0 \u2192 output 2.\n\n(1,1):0 \u2192 output 2.\n\n(2,1):0 \u2192 output 2.\n\n(2,2):0 \u2192 output 2.\n\nBut Example 2's output is:\n\n[2,0,2]\n[0,2,0]\n[0,2,2]\n\nWhich has 2s at (0,0), (0,2), (1,1), (2,1), (2,2). According to this hypothesis, all those should be 2. Which matches.\n\nExample 3:\n\nPart A 0s are (0,0), (0,1), (2,0), (2,2).\n\nPart B cells:\n\n(0,0):1 \u2192 output 0.\n\n(0,1):0 \u2192 output 2.\n\n(2,0):0 \u2192 output 2.\n\n(2,2):1 \u2192 output 0.\n\nBut the output for Example 3 is:\n\n[0,2,0]\n[0,0,0]\n[2,0,0]\n\nSo the 2s are at (0,1) and (2,0). Which matches the hypothesis: part B's (0,1) is 0 \u2192 2, and part B's (2,0) is 0 \u2192 2. The other part A 0s are part B cells 1 \u2192 0.\n\nYes! So the pattern seems to be:\n\nFor each cell in the output, if the corresponding cell in part A is 0 and the corresponding cell in part B is 0 \u2192 output 2. Else, output 0.\n\nWait, but Example 3's output (2,0) is 2. Part B's (2,0) is 0 (since part B's rows are [1,0,0], [0,1,1], [0,0,1]). Wait, part B's rows for Example 3 are:\n\nRow0:1,0,0\n\nRow1:0,1,1\n\nRow2:0,0,1\n\nSo part B's cell (2,0) is 0 \u2192 yes, so output is 2. Correct.\n\nSo the rule is:\n\nThe output is a 3x3 matrix where each cell is 2 if the corresponding cell in part A is 0 and the corresponding cell in part B is 0. Otherwise, the output cell is 0.\n\nBut wait, let's check Example 4:\n\nExample 4's input part A:\n[0,9,0]\n[0,9,9]\n[0,9,9]\n\nPart B:\n[0,0,0]\n[1,1,1]\n[1,0,1]\n\nOutput:\n[2,0,2]\n[0,0,0]\n[0,0,0]\n\nAccording to the rule, part A's 0s are (0,0), (0,2), (1,0), (2,0).\n\nCheck part B's corresponding cells:\n\n(0,0):0 \u2192 output 2.\n\n(0,2):0 \u2192 output 2.\n\n(1,0):1 \u2192 output 0.\n\n(2,0):1 \u2192 output 0.\n\nSo output 2s at (0,0) and (0,2), which matches the output [2,0,2], then 0s elsewhere. Correct.\n\nYes, this pattern holds for all the training examples.\n\nNow, apply this to the test input:\n\nTest Input part A:\n[9,0,9]\n[0,0,9]\n[9,0,9]\n\nPart B:\n[0,1,1]\n[0,1,0]\n[1,0,0]\n\nIdentify the cells where part A is 0 and part B is 0:\n\nPart A 0s are:\n\n(0,1) \u2192 part B (0,1) is 1 \u2192 no.\n\n(1,0) \u2192 part B (1,0) is 0 \u2192 yes.\n\n(1,1) \u2192 part B (1,1) is 1 \u2192 no.\n\n(2,1) \u2192 part B (2,1) is 0 \u2192 yes.\n\nSo output cells (1,0) and (2,1) should be 2, others 0.\n\nThus, the output matrix would be:\n\nRow0: [0,0,0]\n\nRow1: [2,0,0]\n\nRow2: [0,2,0]\n\nWait, but according to the positions:\n\n(1,0) is row1, column0 \u2192 2.\n\n(2,1) is row2, column1 \u2192 2.\n\nSo the output should be:\n\nRow0: [0,0,0]\n\nRow1: [2,0,0]\n\nRow2: [0,2,0]\n\nWait, but looking at the format of the training examples, the output rows are three. Let's structure it:\n\n[\n [0, 0, 0],\n [2, 0, 0],\n [0, 2, 0]\n]\n\nBut wait, looking at the test input's part A and part B:\n\nPart A's 0s:\n\nRow0: index 1 (9,0,9).\n\nRow1: indexes 0 and 1 (0,0,9).\n\nRow2: index 1 (9,0,9).\n\nPart B's cells:\n\nRow0:0,1,1 \u2192 (0,1) is 1 \u2192 no.\n\nRow1:0 (cell (1,0)) is 0 \u2192 yes. Cell (1,1) is 1 \u2192 no.\n\nRow2:1,0,0 \u2192 cell (2,1) is 0 \u2192 yes.\n\nSo output cells are (1,0) and (2,1).\n\nThus, the output matrix is:\n\nRow0: [0,0,0]\n\nRow1: [2,0,0]\n\nRow2: [0,2,0]\n\nBut wait, let's check the training examples. For instance, Example 1's output has:\n\n[0,2,0]\n\n[0,0,0]\n\n[0,2,0]\n\nWhich matches two cells with 2s in different rows.\n\nSo the test input's output should be:\n\n[\n [0, 0, 0],\n [2, 0, 0],\n [0, 2, 0]\n]\n\nBut wait, let me re-express this in three rows:\n\nFirst row: [0,0,0]\n\nSecond row: [2,0,0]\n\nThird row: [0,2,0]\n\nYes. That's the expected output based on the pattern.",

        "cot_2": "Okay, let's try to figure out this puzzle. The task is to find the pattern in the training examples and apply it to the test input. Let's start by looking at the examples given.\n\nFirst, each input consists of two sets of three rows each. For example, in Example 0, the input has six rows: the first three are [0,9,9], [0,9,9], [9,9,9], then the next three are [0,1,0], [0,0,1], [1,1,1]. The output is three rows. So it seems like the input is split into two 3x3 grids stacked vertically, and the output is another 3x3 grid. So maybe the first three rows of the input and the next three are two separate matrices, and the output is derived from combining them somehow.\n\nLooking at the first example's input and output:\n\nInput (first part):\n[0,9,9]\n[0,9,9]\n[9,9,9]\n\nInput (second part):\n[0,1,0]\n[0,0,1]\n[1,1,1]\n\nOutput:\n[2,0,0]\n[2,0,0]\n[0,0,0]\n\nHmm, trying to see how these two matrices combine. Let's think of possible operations. Maybe element-wise operations. Let's check each position.\n\nFor the first element in the output, 2. The corresponding elements in the first input matrices are 0 (from first matrix) and 0 (from second matrix). 0 and 0 giving 2? Not sure. Let's check another position. The second element in the first row of output is 0. The first matrix's first row second element is 9, and the second matrix's is 1. 9 and 1... Maybe the sum? 9+1=10, but 0 is the output. Alternatively, maybe subtracting? 9-1=8, but again not matching. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the digits 9 in the first matrix are being replaced by 0s, and the digits from the second matrix are being added, but that might not explain it. Wait, in example 0's output, the first two rows start with 2, which isn't present in either input. So maybe there's a different approach.\n\nWait, looking at the second part of the input in example 0: the second matrix has 0s, 1s. Maybe the 9s in the first matrix are some kind of mask. For instance, where the first matrix has 9s, maybe we take the value from the second matrix, but in the output, the 0s and 2s don't directly correspond. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the first matrix is a grid where 9s are walls or something, and the second matrix is directions or steps. But the output numbers are 0s and 2s, which could represent counts. Wait, maybe the second matrix's 1s are indicating positions where something is added. Let's see.\n\nIn example 0's second matrix:\nRow 1: 0,1,0 \u2192 maybe these 1s indicate where to place something. But the output in the first row has 2,0,0. Wait, maybe the 2 is counting the number of 1s in some way. But in the first matrix's first row, the first element is 0. The second matrix's first row has 0,1,0. Maybe it's a count of how many times a 1 appears in the same position across the two matrices. Wait, but in example 0, the first matrix's first three rows have two 0s and a 9. The second matrix's first three rows have 0s and 1s. Maybe there's a relation between the two matrices. \n\nWait, perhaps the two matrices are being combined by some operation. Let's think about each cell in the output being determined by the corresponding cells in the two input matrices.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the first matrix is the \"base\" and the second matrix is some kind of modifier. For instance, if the first matrix cell is 9, then the output cell is 0. Otherwise, it's the sum or something else from the second matrix. But in example 0's output, the first cell is 2. The first matrix's cell is 0 (non-9), and the second matrix's cell is 0. So 0 + something equals 2. That doesn't add up. Maybe multiplication?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the second matrix's 1s are being counted in some way. Let's look at the second matrix in example 0: the first row has a 1 in the middle, the second row has a 1 at the end, and the third row has three 1s. The output's first two rows have 2s. Maybe the output counts the number of 1s in the corresponding positions across some layers. Wait, but how are the input matrices structured?\n\nWait, looking at the test input, it's given as six rows. So perhaps the first three rows are one matrix (let's call it matrix A) and the next three are matrix B. Then, the output is a matrix C where each element is determined by A and B.\n\nLooking at example 0:\n\nMatrix A (first three rows):\n0 9 9\n0 9 9\n9 9 9\n\nMatrix B (next three rows):\n0 1 0\n0 0 1\n1 1 1\n\nOutput matrix:\n2 0 0\n2 0 0\n0 0 0\n\nLooking at the positions in matrix A and B:\n\nIn matrix A, where the value is 0, and in matrix B, the value is 0 (like position (0,0) in matrix A and B), the output is 2.\n\nWait, but in (0,0) of A: 0, B:0 \u2192 output 2. Hmm. Then in (0,1) of A:9, B:1 \u2192 output 0. In (0,2) of A:9, B:0 \u2192 output 0.\n\nIn the second row of output, first element is 2. Matrix A (1,0) is 0, B (1,0) is 0 \u2192 output 2. So same as first row.\n\nThird row of output is all zeros. Matrix A's third row is all 9s. So maybe when A's cell is 9, output is 0. But when A's cell is 0, then output is based on B's cell. But in example 0's output, when A is 0 and B is 0, output is 2. When A is 0 and B is 1, output is 0? Wait, no. Let's check.\n\nWait in example 0, the first two rows of output are [2,0,0] and [2,0,0]. Let's see matrix A's first two rows: first two rows are [0,9,9] and [0,9,9]. For each cell where A is 0, B's value is:\n\nFirst row of B: [0,1,0]. So for cell (0,0), A is 0, B is 0 \u2192 output 2.\n\nCell (1,0) in A is 0, B is 0 \u2192 output 2.\n\nBut when A is 0 and B is 1 (like (0,1) in B), the output is 0. Hmm. So maybe if A is 0, then the output is 2 when B is 0, and 0 when B is 1. But how does that make sense? Let's check other examples.\n\nTake example 1:\n\nInput matrices:\n\nA:\n9 0 9\n0 9 9\n0 0 9\n\nB:\n1 0 1\n1 0 0\n1 0 0\n\nOutput:\n[0,2,0]\n[0,0,0]\n[0,2,0]\n\nLooking at the output, let's see where A is 0 and B's values.\n\nFor example, the output's first row is 0,2,0. \n\nIn matrix A's first row: 9,0,9. So the middle cell (A=0), B's middle cell is 0. So according to example 0's possible pattern, when A is 0 and B is 0, output is 2. Here, in the first row middle cell, the output is 2. Which fits. Then, the third row's middle cell in A is 0 (third row of A is 0,0,9), B's third row middle cell is 0. So output is 2, which matches the third row's output [0,2,0]. But in the third row's first cell of A is 0, B is 1 (since third row of B is 1,0,0). So A=0, B=1. According to previous idea, output should be 0, but in the output's third row first cell is 0. So that fits.\n\nWait, but how about when A is 0 and B is 1? Then output is 0. When A is 0 and B is 0, output is 2. When A is 9, output is 0 regardless of B. What about other possibilities?\n\nLooking at example 2:\n\nInput:\n\nA:\n0 9 0\n9 0 9\n9 0 0\n\nB:\n0 0 0\n0 0 1\n1 0 0\n\nOutput:\n[2,0,2]\n[0,2,0]\n[0,2,2]\n\nIn the output's first row: 2,0,2. Let's check A and B for each cell.\n\nFirst row A: 0,9,0.\n\nSo first cell: A=0, B=0 \u2192 output 2.\n\nSecond cell: A=9 \u2192 output 0.\n\nThird cell: A=0, B=0 \u2192 output 2.\n\nThat fits the pattern. Then third row of A is 9,0,0. Third row of B is 1,0,0. Output third row is 0,2,2.\n\nFirst cell: A=9 \u2192 0.\n\nSecond cell: A=0, B=0 \u2192 2.\n\nThird cell: A=0, B=0 \u2192 2.\n\nYes, that matches. So the pattern seems to be:\n\nFor each cell (i,j):\n\nIf A[i][j] is 9 \u2192 output is 0.\n\nElse (A[i][j] is 0):\n\nIf B[i][j] is 0 \u2192 output is 2.\n\nIf B[i][j] is 1 \u2192 output is 0.\n\nBut wait, let's check example 1's output. Matrix B in example 1 is:\n\nB:\n1 0 1\n1 0 0\n1 0 0\n\nSo first row of B is 1,0,1. For the middle cell (A=0, B=0) \u2192 output is 2. Which matches the output [0,2,0].\n\nBut in the first row's first cell, A is 9 (so output 0) and B is 1. So that's 0.\n\nThird row of A is 0,0,9. Third row of B is 1,0,0. So first cell of third row: A=0, B=1 \u2192 output 0. Which is the third row output [0,2,0]. The second cell: A=0, B=0 \u2192 2. Third cell: A=9 \u2192 0. So output is 0,2,0. Which matches.\n\nBut what about when B's cell is something else? Like in example 2's B matrix third row first cell is 1. So when A is 0 and B is 1 \u2192 output is 0.\n\nSo this seems to fit all the examples. Let's verify with example 3.\n\nExample 3 input:\n\nA:\n0 0 9\n9 9 9\n0 9 0\n\nB:\n1 0 0\n0 1 1\n0 0 1\n\nOutput:\n[0,2,0]\n[0,0,0]\n[2,0,0]\n\nIn the first row of A: 0,0,9. B's first row is 1,0,0.\n\nSo first cell: A=0, B=1 \u2192 output 0.\n\nSecond cell: A=0, B=0 \u2192 output 2. Third cell: A=9 \u2192 0. So first row output is [0,2,0], which matches.\n\nThird row of A: 0,9,0. B's third row is 0,0,1.\n\nFirst cell: A=0, B=0 \u2192 output 2. Second cell: A=9 \u2192 0. Third cell: A=0, B=1 \u2192 0. So output third row should be [2,0,0], which matches.\n\nSo the pattern holds here.\n\nAnother example, example 4:\n\nInput A:\n0 9 0\n0 9 9\n0 9 9\n\nB:\n0 0 0\n1 1 1\n1 0 1\n\nOutput:\n[2,0,2]\n[0,0,0]\n[0,0,0]\n\nLooking at first row of A: 0,9,0. B's first row is 0,0,0.\n\nSo first cell: 0 in A and 0 in B \u2192 output 2. Second cell: 9 \u2192 0. Third cell: 0 in A and 0 in B \u2192 2. So first row output [2,0,2]. Which matches.\n\nSecond row of A: 0,9,9. B's second row is 1,1,1. But A's cells here are 0,9,9. So first cell: A=0, B=1 \u2192 output 0. Second and third cells: 9 \u2192 0. So output row is [0,0,0]. Which matches the second output row. Third row of A is 0,9,9. B's third row is 1,0,1. First cell: A=0, B=1 \u2192 0. Others are 9 \u2192 0. So third row output is [0,0,0], which matches.\n\nSo the pattern seems consistent across all examples. Therefore, the rule is:\n\n- For each cell in the output matrix:\n  - If the corresponding cell in matrix A (the first three rows) is 9, output 0.\n  - Else (A is 0):\n    - If the corresponding cell in matrix B (the next three rows) is 0, output 2.\n    - If B is 1, output 0.\n\nNow, applying this to the test input.\n\nTest input:\n\nMatrix A:\n[9, 0, 9]\n[0, 0, 9]\n[9, 0, 9]\n\nMatrix B:\n[0, 1, 1]\n[0, 1, 0]\n[1, 0, 0]\n\nLet's process each cell:\n\nRow 0 of output (i=0):\n\nCell (0,0): A=9 \u2192 0\nCell (0,1): A=0, B=1 \u2192 0\nCell (0,2): A=9 \u2192 0\n\u2192 [0, 0, 0]\n\nRow 1 (i=1):\n\nCell (1,0): A=0, B=0 \u2192 2\nCell (1,1): A=0, B=1 \u2192 0\nCell (1,2): A=9 \u2192 0\n\u2192 [2, 0, 0]\n\nRow 2 (i=2):\n\nCell (2,0): A=9 \u2192 0\nCell (2,1): A=0, B=0 \u2192 2\nCell (2,2): A=9 \u2192 0\n\u2192 [0, 2, 0]\n\nWait, but putting these together:\n\nRow 0: [0,0,0]\n\nRow 1: [2,0,0]\n\nRow 2: [0,2,0]\n\nBut wait, let me check again. Let me list each cell step by step.\n\nMatrix A rows:\n\nRow 0: 9,0,9\n\nRow 1: 0,0,9\n\nRow 2:9,0,9\n\nMatrix B rows:\n\nRow 0: 0,1,1\n\nRow 1:0,1,0\n\nRow 2:1,0,0\n\nProcessing each cell:\n\nOutput row 0:\n\n(0,0): A=9 \u2192 0\n\n(0,1): A=0, B=1 \u2192 0\n\n(0,2): A=9 \u2192 0\n\n\u2192 [0,0,0]\n\nRow 1:\n\n(1,0): A=0, B=0 \u2192 2\n\n(1,1): A=0, B=1 \u2192 0\n\n(1,2): A=9 \u2192 0\n\n\u2192 [2,0,0]\n\nRow 2:\n\n(2,0): A=9 \u2192 0\n\n(2,1): A=0, B=0 \u2192 2\n\n(2,2): A=9 \u2192 0\n\n\u2192 [0,2,0]\n\nSo the output matrix would be:\n\n[0, 0, 0]\n\n[2, 0, 0]\n\n[0, 2, 0]\n\nBut looking back at the training examples, sometimes the output has 2s in different positions. Let me check if this matches any of the examples. For instance, example 1's output is:\n\n[0,2,0]\n\n[0,0,0]\n\n[0,2,0]\n\nWhich has 2s in the middle of the first and third rows. The test output here would have 2s in the first and third rows, but different positions.\n\nWait, but according to our calculation, the test output is:\n\n[0,0,0]\n\n[2,0,0]\n\n[0,2,0]\n\nBut perhaps I made a mistake. Let me check again.\n\nWait, in row 1 (index 1) of matrix A: [0,0,9]. So for row 1:\n\nCell (1,0): A=0, B=0 \u2192 output 2.\n\nCell (1,1): A=0, B=1 \u2192 output 0.\n\nCell (1,2): A=9 \u2192 0.\n\nSo row 1 output is [2,0,0].\n\nRow 2 of matrix A is [9,0,9]. So:\n\nCell (2,0): A=9 \u2192 0.\n\nCell (2,1): A=0, B=0 (since B row 2 is [1,0,0], so B[2][1] is 0) \u2192 output 2.\n\nCell (2,2): A=9 \u2192 0.\n\nSo row 2 output is [0,2,0].\n\nSo the full output matrix is:\n\n[0,0,0]\n\n[2,0,0]\n\n[0,2,0]\n\nBut let's check the training examples to see if this structure exists. For instance, example 1's output has:\n\n[0,2,0]\n\n[0,0,0]\n\n[0,2,0]\n\nWhich is different. But according to the rules we derived, the test input's output would be as above.\n\nBut wait, is there another pattern that I'm missing? Let's re-examine the examples to see if there's a different interpretation.\n\nWait, looking at example 0's output:\n\n[2,0,0]\n\n[2,0,0]\n\n[0,0,0]\n\nMatrix A's first two rows have 0s in the first column. So when B's first two rows in the first column are 0 and 0, the output is 2. So in each of those positions, output is 2. That's correct.\n\nAnother thought: perhaps the output is based on the sum of the 1s in the B matrix in some way. For example, in example 0's B matrix, the first row has one 1, the second row has one 1, the third row has three 1s. But the output's first two rows have 2s where B's 1s are not present. Hmm, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output counts the number of 0s in B where A is 0. For example, in example 0's first row, where A is 0 (first column), B is 0. So output is 2. But why 2? Maybe each 0 in B contributes 1, but then in example 0's first cell, there's one 0 in B, but output is 2. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is 2 for each 0 in B where A is 0, and 0 otherwise. Which aligns with our earlier conclusion.\n\nBut according to that, the test output would have:\n\nRow 0: 0,0,0 (because A's row 0 has 9,0,9. So only the middle cell is 0. B's row 0 middle cell is 1 \u2192 output 0.\n\nRow 1: A's row 1 is 0,0,9. So first and second cells. B's row 1 is 0,1,0. So first cell (0 in B) \u2192 output 2. Second cell (1 in B) \u2192 output 0. So row 1 is [2,0,0].\n\nRow 2: A's row 2 is 9,0,9. Middle cell is 0. B's row 2 is 1,0,0. So middle cell in B is 0 \u2192 output 2. So row 2 is [0,2,0].\n\nSo the output is:\n\n[0,0,0]\n\n[2,0,0]\n\n[0,2,0]\n\nBut I need to check if this matches any of the training examples' structure. Let's see if any example has 2s in the first and middle of the third row. Looking at example 2's output:\n\n[2,0,2]\n\n[0,2,0]\n\n[0,2,2]\n\nWhich has 2s in different positions. So maybe the answer I'm getting is correct.\n\nBut wait, in the training examples, the output is always three rows. The test input's output according to our rules is:\n\nRow 0: [0,0,0]\n\nRow 1: [2,0,0]\n\nRow 2: [0,2,0]\n\nBut let me check if this is possible. Are there any examples where the output has a row with all zeros? Yes, example 0's third row is all zeros. Example 4's second and third rows are all zeros. So it's possible.\n\nThus, the final output for the test input should be:\n\n[0, 0, 0]\n\n[2, 0, 0]\n\n[0, 2, 0]"
