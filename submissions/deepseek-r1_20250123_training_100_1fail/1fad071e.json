        "cot_1": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. So, we have these input grids and outputs. The inputs are 9x9 grids with numbers 0, 1, 2. The outputs are lists of 5 elements, all 0s and 1s. Let's look at the examples to see what's going on.\n\nStarting with Example 0. The output is [1,1,0,0,0]. Hmm, maybe each element in the output corresponds to a row or a column? Or perhaps it's counting something. Let's look at the input. Each row in the input is a list of 9 elements. Maybe the output is related to the occurrence of certain patterns in each row.\n\nLooking at the first example's input rows:\n\nFirst row: [0,0,0,0,2,2,0,0,1]. Let's see if there's a pattern here. The 2s are consecutive, then a 1 at the end. The output starts with two 1s. Maybe the first two elements in the output represent the presence of consecutive 2s followed by a 1? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is counting how many times a specific sequence appears in each row. Let's check all the rows in Example 0. The output is 5 elements long. Maybe each position in the output corresponds to a specific row or column. But there are 9 rows in each input, so that might not fit.\n\nWait, looking at the outputs for the examples:\n\nExample 0: [1,1,0,0,0]\n\nExample 1: [1,1,1,1,0]\n\nExample 2: [1,1,1,1,0]\n\nHmm, the first two examples have outputs with varying numbers of 1s. Maybe the output represents the count of certain patterns across the entire grid. For example, maybe each position in the output corresponds to a certain pattern in the grid, like the presence of 1s followed by 0s or something.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is determined by checking each row for a specific condition and aggregating those. Let's look at Example 0's output: five elements. Maybe each output element represents the presence of a certain condition in consecutive rows. For example, if we look at pairs of rows, each output position could indicate whether a pattern exists in that pair.\n\nWait, but there are 9 rows in each input. How does that split into 5 outputs? 9 rows could be grouped into 5 pairs with some overlap. Like, rows 1-2, 3-4, 5-6, 7-8, 9? But not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each output element corresponds to a specific column in the grid. Let's check the columns. Each input has 9 columns. The output has 5 elements. Maybe each output element is derived from a pair of columns. For example, columns 1-2, 3-4, 5-6, 7-8, 9. That would make 5 elements. Let's check that.\n\nTake Example 0's first column across all rows:\n\nLooking at the first column of each row in Example 0:\n\n0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0. So the first column has a 1 in the fifth row. Then, the second column is 0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1. The third column is 0,1,1,0,2,2,0,0,0. Wait, but how does that relate to the output [1,1,0,0,0]?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is about the presence of certain patterns in each of the first five columns. For example, checking each of the first five columns for a specific condition. Let's see:\n\nIn Example 0's output, the first two elements are 1, and the rest 0. Maybe columns 1 and 2 have a certain pattern. Let's check column 1 across all rows: it's 0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0. Maybe the presence of a 1 in this column? But there's a 1 in the fifth row, which could make the first output element 1. Column 2: 0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1. Maybe the presence of two 1s in a row? In rows 2 and 3, there are 1s, so maybe that's why the second output is 1. But then how about columns 3,4,5?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output counts the number of rows where a certain pattern occurs. For example, each output element corresponds to a specific row's pattern, but there are 9 rows and 5 outputs. That doesn't add up.\n\nWait, another approach: perhaps the output is the count of certain blocks of 1s and 2s. For example, in the grid, maybe each 2x2 block of 1s or 2s contributes to the output. Let's see. But the output is a list, not a count.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the parity (even or odd) of the number of 1s in each of the first five rows. Let's check Example 0's first five rows:\n\nRow 0: [0,0,0,0,2,2,0,0,1] \u2192 1 one.\nRow 1: [0,1,1,0,2,2,0,0,0] \u2192 two 1s.\nRow 2: [0,1,1,0,0,0,0,2,2] \u2192 two 1s.\nRow 3: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,2] \u2192 zero 1s.\nRow 4: [1,0,2,2,0,0,0,0,0] \u2192 one 1.\n\nIf the output is the parity (1 for odd, 0 for even), then row 0:1, row1:0, row2:0, row3:0, row4:1. The output is [1,0,0,0,1], which doesn't match the example's output [1,1,0,0,0]. So that's not it.\n\nAnother idea: Maybe the output relates to sequences of 1s followed by 2s or vice versa. For example, in each row, if there's a transition from 1 to 2 or 2 to 1, that's counted. But not sure.\n\nLooking at the output lengths: all examples have 5 elements. Maybe the output corresponds to the five middle columns? Or the five middle rows? The middle row is the fifth row (index 4, if starting from 0). But the output has five elements.\n\nAlternatively, the output might be generated by considering each of the 5 possible positions where a 2x2 block of 1s or 2s exists. Let's see. For example, in a grid, a 2x2 block of 1s would be a square of four 1s. Similarly for 2s. But how does that map to 5 elements?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output counts how many times a certain pattern occurs in each of five specific regions of the grid. For instance, the grid is divided into five regions, and the output tells whether each region has a certain pattern.\n\nAnother approach: Let's look for the presence of the sequence [2,2] in the rows. For example, in Example 0's input:\n\nRow0: 2,2 at positions 4,5. Then a 0,0,1. Maybe the presence of 2,2 followed by 0,0,1? Not sure. The output is [1,1,0,0,0]. Maybe each output position corresponds to a certain row having a 2,2 sequence. Let's count how many rows have 2,2 in them.\n\nIn Example 0:\n\nRow0: has 2,2 \u2192 yes.\nRow1: 2,2 \u2192 yes.\nRow2: 0,0,0 \u2192 no 2,2.\nRow3: 2,2 at end.\nRow4: 2,2 at positions 2,3.\nRow5: 2,2 at start.\nRow6: no 2,2.\nRow7: no 2,2.\nRow8: no 2,2.\n\nSo total 5 rows with 2,2. But the output is [1,1,0,0,0], which is two 1s. So that doesn't align.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output elements correspond to the presence of 1s in certain positions. Let's check the outputs:\n\nExample0: [1,1,0,0,0]. The first two elements are 1. Maybe each output element is 1 if there's a 1 in the corresponding column of the first row. Wait, first row of Example0 is [0,0,0,0,2,2,0,0,1]. The first five columns are 0,0,0,0,2. So columns 1-5 (if 1-indexed) would be 0,0,0,0,2. But output starts with two 1s. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by looking at each row and checking if there's a 1 followed by a 1 (i.e., two consecutive 1s). Let's count how many rows have that.\n\nIn Example0:\n\nRow1: [0,1,1,0,...] \u2192 has two 1s. So that's one row.\nRow2: [0,1,1,0,...] \u2192 another.\nRow5: [0,0,2,2,0,1,1,0,0] \u2192 has two 1s.\nRow6: no.\nRow8: [0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1] \u2192 no.\n\nSo three rows with consecutive 1s. But the output is [1,1,0,0,0], which has two 1s. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe the output is the count of such occurrences in the first five rows. Let's see. Example0's first five rows:\n\nRow0: no consecutive 1s.\nRow1: yes (positions 1,2).\nRow2: yes (positions 1,2).\nRow3: no.\nRow4: no.\nSo two occurrences. The output starts with two 1s. Then the rest 0. So maybe the output elements are 1 for each of the first two rows that have consecutive 1s, and then 0s for the next three? But in example0, the output is [1,1,0,0,0], which would align with two 1s. Then, perhaps each output element represents whether in the first five rows, each row (from row0 to row4) has consecutive 1s. Let's check:\n\nRow0: 0,0,0,0,2,2,0,0,1 \u2192 no \u2192 0.\nRow1: 0,1,1,0 \u2192 yes \u2192 1.\nRow2: 0,1,1,0 \u2192 yes \u2192 1.\nRow3: no \u2192 0.\nRow4: 1,0,2 \u2192 no \u21920.\nSo the output would be [0,1,1,0,0], but the actual output is [1,1,0,0,0]. Doesn't match.\n\nHmm. Maybe it's the opposite. Let's think of columns. For each column, check if there are two consecutive 1s in that column. Let's see Example0's columns.\n\nLooking at each column across all rows:\n\nColumn0: 0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0 \u2192 no consecutive 1s.\nColumn1:0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1 \u2192 has 1,1 in rows1 and 2 \u2192 yes.\nColumn2:0,1,1,0,2,2,0,0,0 \u2192 same as column1.\nColumn3:0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0 \u2192 no.\nColumn4:2,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0 \u2192 no 1s.\nColumn5:2,2,0,0,0,1,1,0,0 \u2192 yes in row5 (1,1).\nBut columns are vertical. Wait, column1 has 0,1,1,0, etc. So in column1, rows1 and 2 are 1s. So consecutive 1s. Similarly for column2. Column5 in row5 has 1s. So columns 1,2,5 have consecutive 1s. But the output has two 1s in Example0. Not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output represents the number of consecutive 1s in the first five columns. For each row, if the first five columns contain two consecutive 1s, count as 1. Then sum across rows? Not sure.\n\nAnother angle: Let's look at the outputs. All examples have 5 elements. Example0 has two 1s, Example1 has four, Example2 has four. Maybe it's about counting the number of 2x2 squares of 1s or 2s in the grid. Let's check Example0's input for 2x2 blocks.\n\nIn Example0:\n\nLooking for 2x2 blocks of 1s or 2s.\n\nRow1 and row2 in columns1-2: both have 1,1 \u2192 that's a 2x2 block of 1s (rows1-2, cols1-2). So that's one.\n\nRow5 and row6: row5 has 2,2 in cols2-3. But row6 has 0,0. So no.\n\nRow4 has 2,2 in cols2-3.\n\nRow0 has 2,2 in cols4-5.\n\nRow3 has 2,2 in cols7-8.\n\nRow8 has 1 in col8. Not a block.\n\nSo total 2x2 blocks of 2s: row0 (4-5), row3 (7-8), row4 (2-3). And one block of 1s (rows1-2 cols1-2). But how does that translate to the output? The output for Example0 is [1,1,0,0,0]. Maybe each output element represents a particular type of block. For example, the first two elements are 1s for two blocks of 1s and 2s. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each output element corresponds to a diagonal in the grid. Like, the main diagonals or something. But there are two main diagonals (from top-left to bottom-right and top-right to bottom-left), but that's only two elements. Not five.\n\nHmm, this is tricky. Let's think differently. Maybe the output is related to the positions where 1s and 2s are adjacent. Like, each time a 1 is followed by a 2 or vice versa in a row. But how does that aggregate into five elements?\n\nWait, the outputs are lists of 0s and 1s. Maybe each position in the output represents a certain condition being met. For example, the first element is 1 if there's a row with three 1s, etc. Let's check:\n\nIn Example0:\n\nLooking for rows with three 1s: none. All rows have 0,1, or 2 1s.\n\nSo that's not it.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the presence of a specific pattern in each of the first five rows. For example, each output element is 1 if the corresponding row starts with a 0. Let's see:\n\nExample0's first five rows start with 0,0,0,0,1 \u2192 so output would be [1,1,1,1,0]. But the actual output is [1,1,0,0,0]. Doesn't match.\n\nAnother thought: Maybe the output elements are flags indicating the presence of a 1 in each of the five central columns (columns 2,3,4,5,6) of the middle row (row4). Let's check Example0's row4: [1,0,2,2,0,0,0,0,0]. Columns 2-6 are 2,2,0,0,0. So those columns in row4 have 2,2,0,0,0. The output is [1,1,0,0,0]. If 2 is considered as a 1 in the output, maybe not. Alternatively, maybe 1s in those positions. But there are no 1s here. So that's not it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each output element corresponds to the presence of a 1 in the diagonal of the grid. For example, positions (0,0), (1,1), (2,2), etc. Let's check Example0's diagonal elements:\n\nRow0: 0 (position 0)\nRow1: 1 (position1)\nRow2: 1 (position2)\nRow3:0 (position3)\nRow4:0 (position4)\nRow5:2 (position5)\nRow6:0 (position6)\nRow7:0 (position7)\nRow8:1 (position8)\nSo the diagonal has 0,1,1,0,0,2,0,0,1. The first five diagonal elements (positions 0-4) are 0,1,1,0,0. So the output is [0,1,1,0,0], but the example's output is [1,1,0,0,0]. Doesn't match.\n\nWait, perhaps it's the anti-diagonal? Let's see:\n\nRow0, column8: 1\nRow1, column7:0\nRow2, column6:0\nRow3, column5:0\nRow4, column4:0\nRow5, column3:0\nRow6, column2:0\nRow7, column1:0\nRow8, column0:0\n\nSo anti-diagonal elements: 1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0. First five: 1,0,0,0,0. Output example0 is [1,1,0,0,0]. So first element is 1. Maybe that's part of it, but not the rest.\n\nHmm. Maybe it's checking for each row whether there's a 1 followed by a 2. Let's look:\n\nExample0's rows:\n\nRow0: ends with 1, preceded by 0. No 1 followed by 2.\n\nRow1: 1,1 followed by 0. No.\n\nRow2: 1,1 followed by 0.\n\nRow4: 2,2.\n\nRow5: has 1,1 followed by 0.\n\nSo maybe the presence of 1 followed by 2? Not seeing any. Alternatively, 2 followed by 2.\n\nIn Example0, there are multiple instances of 2,2. Maybe the output counts the number of rows where 2,2 appears. Let's count:\n\nRow0: 2,2 \u2192 yes.\nRow1: 2,2 \u2192 yes.\nRow3: 2,2 \u2192 yes.\nRow4: 2,2 \u2192 yes.\nRow5: 2,2 \u2192 yes.\nRow8: no.\n\nSo 5 rows with 2,2. But the output is [1,1,0,0,0]. Maybe the first five rows (rows0-4) in Example0 have 2,2 in rows0,1,3,4. Wait:\n\nRow0: yes.\n\nRow1: yes.\n\nRow2: no.\n\nRow3: yes.\n\nRow4: yes.\n\nSo in the first five rows, four have 2,2. But the output is [1,1,0,0,0]. Not matching.\n\nAlternatively, the output is 1 for each row where a 2,2 is followed by a 0,0. For example, in row0 of Example0: 2,2 followed by 0,0. So that's a yes. Then, row1: 2,2 followed by 0,0. So that's yes. Row3: 2,2 at the end, maybe followed by nothing. Row4: 2,2 followed by 0. Hmm.\n\nIf the output is the count of such occurrences in the first five rows, then rows0,1,4 would qualify. But example0's output has two 1s. So that might not fit.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Let's look at the test input and see if that can give a clue.\n\nTest input:\n\n[0,0,0,0,0,2,2,0,1]\n\n[1,1,0,1,0,2,2,0,0]\n\n[1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\n[0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0]\n\n[0,2,2,0,0,1,1,0,0]\n\n[0,2,2,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\n[1,0,0,0,0,0,2,2,0]\n\n[2,2,0,1,1,0,2,2,0]\n\n[2,2,0,1,1,0,0,0,0]\n\nLooking for patterns. For example, rows with 2,2:\n\nRow0: 2,2 in positions5-6.\n\nRow1: 2,2 in positions5-6.\n\nRow4: 2,2 in positions1-2.\n\nRow5: 2,2 in positions1-2.\n\nRow7: 2,2 in positions0-1 and 6-7.\n\nRow8: 2,2 in positions0-1.\n\nSo multiple rows with 2,2. Also, some rows have 1,1:\n\nRow1: 1,1 in positions0-1.\n\nRow2: 1,1 in 0-1.\n\nRow3: 1,1 in 5-6.\n\nRow4: 1,1 in 5-6.\n\nRow7:1,1 in 3-4.\n\nRow8:1,1 in 3-4.\n\nSo the test input has both 2,2 and 1,1 blocks.\n\nLooking at the training examples, the outputs are varying. Example0's output has two 1s, Example1 and 2 have four. Maybe the output counts the number of 2,2 blocks and 1,1 blocks in specific positions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each element in the output corresponds to a specific quadrant or area of the grid. For example, dividing the 9x9 grid into five regions and checking if each has a certain pattern. But I'm not sure.\n\nWait, the output has five elements. What if each element represents a certain 3x3 section of the grid? The 9x9 grid can be divided into nine 3x3 grids, but that would be nine sections. Not five. Alternatively, maybe overlapping sections.\n\nAlternatively, the output could be related to the five middle rows (rows2-6), each contributing one element. But how?\n\nAnother approach: Let's look for the sum of 1s and 2s in each row, then take modulo 2. But Example0's output isn't matching that.\n\nWait, let's think of the output as a binary number. Example0's output is 11000, which is 24 in decimal. Example1 and 2 are 11110, which is 30. But I don't see how that connects.\n\nAlternatively, the output could be the counts of 1s in the first five columns, modulo something. Let's check:\n\nExample0's first five columns for each row:\n\nRow0: 0,0,0,0,2 \u2192 sum of 1s: 0.\n\nRow1:0,1,1,0,2 \u2192 sum 2.\n\nRow2:0,1,1,0,0 \u2192 sum 2.\n\nRow3:0,0,0,0,0 \u2192 0.\n\nRow4:1,0,2,2,0 \u2192 sum 1.\n\nSo total 0+2+2+0+1 =5. But output is [1,1,0,0,0]. Not sure.\n\nHmm. Maybe the output is the parity (even or odd) of the number of 1s in each row's first five elements. Let's check Example0:\n\nRow0: 0,0,0,0,2 \u2192 0 ones \u2192 even \u2192 0.\n\nRow1:0,1,1,0,2 \u2192 2 \u2192 even \u2192 0.\n\nRow2:0,1,1,0,0 \u2192 2 \u2192 even \u21920.\n\nRow3:0,0,0,0,0 \u21920 \u2192 even \u21920.\n\nRow4:1,0,2,2,0 \u21921 \u2192 odd \u21921.\n\nSo first five rows would give [0,0,0,0,1]. But output is [1,1,0,0,0]. Doesn't match.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is about the presence of '1's in specific positions across all rows. For example, the first element checks if any row has a 1 in the first column. The second checks the second column, etc. Let's see Example0:\n\nColumn0 has a 1 in row4. So first element would be 1.\n\nColumn1 has 1s in rows1,2,8. So second element 1.\n\nColumn2 has 1s in rows1,2. So third element 1?\n\nBut output is [1,1,0,0,0]. So columns 0 and 1 have 1s. But why the output elements are five? Columns 0-4? Let's check:\n\nExample0's columns 0-4:\n\nColumn0: has 1 \u2192 yes.\n\nColumn1: has 1s \u2192 yes.\n\nColumn2: has 1s \u2192 yes.\n\nColumn3: 0s \u2192 no.\n\nColumn4: 2s \u2192 no.\n\nSo output would be [1,1,1,0,0]. But actual output is [1,1,0,0,0]. Not matching.\n\nThis is really challenging. Let's think outside the box. Maybe the output is the number of times a certain sequence appears in each of the five possible positions across all rows. For example, the sequence [1,1] or [2,2].\n\nIn Example0:\n\nNumber of rows with [1,1] \u2192 rows1,2,5. Three times.\n\nNumber of rows with [2,2] \u2192 rows0,1,3,4,5. Five times.\n\nBut output is [1,1,0,0,0].\n\nAlternatively, the output counts how many times each of the five possible pairs (e.g., 1-1, 2-2, 1-2, etc.) appear in consecutive positions across all rows. But I'm not sure.\n\nWait, another idea: Maybe the output represents the presence of a specific pattern in each of the five 3x3 subgrids that are in the middle. For example, the 9x9 grid can be divided into five overlapping 3x3 regions. But how?\n\nAlternatively, the output could be the count of the number of 2x2 blocks of 2s and 1s in the grid, with each output element representing a different type. For example, the first element is the count of 2x2 blocks of 1s, the second of 2s, and the others something else. But in Example0, there's one 2x2 block of 1s (rows1-2, cols1-2) and several of 2s. Let's count:\n\nExample0's 2x2 blocks of 2s:\n\nRow0, cols4-5: 2,2. Next row (row1) cols4-5: 2,2. So that's a 2x2 block of 2s (rows0-1, cols4-5).\n\nRow3, cols7-8: 2,2. But next row (row4) cols7-8: 0,0. So no.\n\nRow4, cols2-3: 2,2. Next row (row5) cols2-3: 2,2. So another 2x2 block (rows4-5, cols2-3).\n\nRow5, cols0-1: 0,0. No.\n\nSo total two 2x2 blocks of 2s and one of 1s. Example0's output has two 1s. Maybe the output elements are flags for the presence of these blocks. But how?\n\nAlternatively, each output element corresponds to a specific region. Like, the first two elements are for 1-blocks and the next three for 2-blocks. But this is speculative.\n\nLet's look at Example1's output: [1,1,1,1,0]. The input has more 2,2 and 1,1 blocks.\n\nExample1's input rows:\n\nRow0: [1,1,0,2,0,0,0,0,2]. Has 1,1 at the start.\n\nRow1: [1,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0]. 1,1 at start and 1,1 at positions5-6.\n\nRow2: [0,0,0,2,0,1,1,0,0]. 1,1 at positions5-6.\n\nRow4: [0,1,1,0,2,2,0,0,0]. 1,1 and 2,2.\n\nRow5: [0,1,1,0,2,2,0,0,2]. 1,1 and 2,2.\n\nRow7: [0,0,0,2,2,0,1,1,0]. 2,2 and 1,1.\n\nRow8: [0,1,0,2,2,0,1,1,0]. 2,2 and 1,1.\n\nSo there are multiple 1,1 and 2,2 blocks. The output is four 1s. Maybe each 1 in the output corresponds to a pair of 1,1 and 2,2 blocks in the same row. For example, if a row has both 1,1 and 2,2 sequences, it contributes to the output. But how?\n\nAlternatively, the output counts the number of rows where both 1,1 and 2,2 appear. In Example1, row4 and row5 have both. Row7 and row8 have both. But how does that translate to four 1s?\n\nThis is getting too time-consuming. Let's try to find a different approach. Maybe the output is the number of times the digit 1 appears in the first five positions of each row. For Example0:\n\nFirst five elements of each row:\n\nRow0: 0,0,0,0,2 \u2192 0.\n\nRow1:0,1,1,0,2 \u2192 2.\n\nRow2:0,1,1,0,0 \u2192 2.\n\nRow3:0,0,0,0,0 \u21920.\n\nRow4:1,0,2,2,0 \u21921.\n\nSumming these for each row gives [0,2,2,0,1]. The output is [1,1,0,0,0]. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the output is whether each of the first five rows has at least one 1. For Example0:\n\nRow0: no 1 in first five \u2192 0.\n\nRow1: yes \u21921.\n\nRow2: yes \u21921.\n\nRow3: no \u21920.\n\nRow4: yes \u21921.\n\nSo output would be [0,1,1,0,1], but example0's output is [1,1,0,0,0]. Doesn't match.\n\nWait, maybe the output is checking for the presence of the sequence 1,1 in each row. For each of the first five rows, if they have 1,1, the output is 1. In Example0:\n\nRow0: no.\n\nRow1: yes.\n\nRow2: yes.\n\nRow3: no.\n\nRow4: no.\n\nSo the output would be [0,1,1,0,0]. But example0's output is [1,1,0,0,0]. Close but not the same.\n\nAh, maybe it's checking the entire grid for 1,1 sequences in any row, and the output elements represent whether there's at least one in the first row, then second, etc., up to five. But example0 has 1,1 in rows1 and 2. So output would be [0,1,1,0,0], but the actual output is [1,1,0,0,0]. So no.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's checking the entire grid for the number of times a 1,1 sequence is followed by a 2,2 sequence in the same row. For example, in a row like [1,1,0,2,2], that would count. Example0's row1 is [0,1,1,0,2,2,0,0,0]. So 1,1 followed by 2,2. So this row would count. Then, how many such rows are there in the first five rows?\n\nIn Example0's first five rows:\n\nRow0: 2,2 followed by 0,0,1 \u2192 no.\n\nRow1: yes \u2192 1.\n\nRow2: no.\n\nRow3: 2,2 at the end \u2192 no.\n\nRow4: 2,2 in the middle \u2192 no.\n\nSo only row1. But output has two 1s.\n\nThis is really perplexing. Maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Let's think of the output as [a, b, c, d, e], each element corresponding to a certain condition. Let's look at the first element of each output:\n\nExample0: 1\n\nExample1:1\n\nExample2:1\n\nSo the first element is always 1. No, in Example0 and others, but the test input's output may vary. Wait, in all training examples, the first two elements are 1s except Example0's third element is 0. Hmm.\n\nAnother angle: The output's length is 5. The input grids have 9 rows. Maybe the output is related to the five middle rows (rows 2-6). Each output element corresponds to a certain feature in each of these rows. For example, if the row contains both 1,1 and 2,2 sequences.\n\nExample0's rows 2-6:\n\nRow2: [0,1,1,0,0,0,0,2,2] \u2192 has 1,1 and 2,2.\n\nRow3: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,2] \u2192 2,2.\n\nRow4: [1,0,2,2,0,0,0,0,0] \u21922,2.\n\nRow5: [0,0,2,2,0,1,1,0,0] \u21922,2 and 1,1.\n\nRow6: [0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0] \u21921,1.\n\nSo rows 2,5 have both sequences. Output is [1,1,0,0,0]. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, each output element is 1 if the corresponding row (rows 2-6) has a 2,2 sequence. So rows2: yes, row3: yes, row4: yes, row5: yes, row6: no. So the output would be [1,1,1,1,0]. But Example0's output is [1,1,0,0,0]. Doesn't match.\n\nThis is really tough. Let's try to find another pattern. Looking at the test input's first row: [0,0,0,0,0,2,2,0,1]. So 2,2 at positions5-6. Maybe the output is about counting the number of times 2,2 appears in the rows. For example, the first output element is 1 if any row starts with 2,2. Second if any row has 2,2 in positions1-2, etc., for the first five possible positions. Let's see:\n\nFor Example0:\n\nRows with 2,2 in positions0-1: none.\n\nIn positions1-2: none.\n\nIn positions2-3: row4.\n\nIn positions3-4: no.\n\nIn positions4-5: row0 and row1.\n\nSo the output could be [0,0,1,0,1], but the actual output is [1,1,0,0,0]. Not matching.\n\nAnother idea: The output is the count of 2,2 pairs in each column. For example, each output element represents the presence of a 2,2 pair in columns0-4. Let's see:\n\nExample0's columns0-4:\n\nColumn0: no 2,2.\n\nColumn1: no 2,2.\n\nColumn2: row4 has a 2, but row5 has 2,2. So in column2, rows4 and5 have 2s. So consecutive 2s.\n\nWait, columns are vertical. So checking columns for consecutive 2s.\n\nColumn0: 0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0 \u2192 no.\n\nColumn1:0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1 \u2192 no 2s.\n\nColumn2:0,1,1,0,2,2,0,0,0 \u2192 row4 and5 have 2,2. So consecutive 2s in column2 rows4-5.\n\nColumn3:0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0 \u2192 no.\n\nColumn4:2,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0 \u2192 rows0-1 have 2s. So consecutive 2s in column4 rows0-1.\n\nSo columns2 and4 have consecutive 2s. If the output's first two elements are 1 for columns0 and1 having 2,2, but they don't. So maybe this isn't it.\n\nAlternatively, the output is the number of columns where there's a 2,2 sequence. For Example0, columns2 and4 have consecutive 2s. So output would have two 1s. Which matches Example0's output [1,1,0,0,0]. Maybe the first two columns with 2,2 sequences, but columns2 and4 are third and fifth columns. So this doesn't align.\n\nBut Example0's output has two 1s. If the output is the count of columns (from columns0-4) that have a 2,2 sequence, then columns2 and4 (columns are 0-based). So columns2 and4 would be positions2 and4 in the output, which would be 0,0,1,0,1. But Example0's output is [1,1,0,0,0]. Doesn't match.\n\nThis is really challenging. I think I'm missing something obvious. Let's look at the test input and see what the expected output might be, based on the training examples.\n\nTest input has multiple rows with 2,2 and 1,1 sequences. For example, row1 has 1,1 at the start and 2,2 at positions5-6. Row2 has 1,1 at start. Row3 and4 have 1,1 at positions5-6. Row7 and8 have 2,2 at start and 1,1 in middle. Also row7 has 2,2 at the end.\n\nIf the output counts the number of rows where 1,1 and 2,2 both appear, then maybe each such row contributes to the output. But how?\n\nAlternatively, the output might be the count of the number of times a 1,1 is immediately followed by a 2,2 in the same row. For example, in row1 of the test input: [1,1,0,1,0,2,2,0,0]. There's 1,1 followed by other stuff, then 2,2. So not consecutive. But if there's a 1,1 followed by 2,2 somewhere in the row, maybe that's a condition.\n\nAlternatively, the output could be the number of times a 1,1 sequence appears in the grid, with each output element representing a specific row. But I'm stuck.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and not finding the pattern, I'll try to make an educated guess based on the training examples. The outputs for examples 1 and 2 are [1,1,1,1,0], and example0 is [1,1,0,0,0]. Looking at the test input, which has several rows with both 1,1 and 2,2 sequences (like rows1,2,4,5,7,8), maybe the output is [1,1,1,1,0], similar to examples1 and 2. But the test input might have more 2,2 blocks. Alternatively, maybe the output is [1,1,1,1,0] again.",

        "cot_2": "Okay, let's tackle this puzzle. So, I need to figure out the pattern that transforms the input matrices into the output lists. Let's look at the training examples to find a pattern.\n\nStarting with Example 0. The input is a 9x9 grid with numbers 0, 1, and 2. The output is [1,1,0,0,0]. Hmm, maybe the output is related to the count of certain sequences or patterns in each row. But the output has 5 elements, and the input has 9 rows. Wait, maybe the output is not directly per row. Let me check the other examples.\n\nLooking at Example 1's output: [1,1,1,1,0]. And Example 2's output is the same as Example 1. So the output lists have 5 elements. Maybe they're counting something across the entire grid, grouped in some way. Let's think about possible patterns.\n\nAnother approach: Maybe the output corresponds to the number of times a certain pattern appears in each column or row. For instance, maybe counting pairs of 1s or 2s. Let me check the first example.\n\nIn Example 0's input, let's look for sequences. For example, in the first row [0,0,0,0,2,2,0,0,1], there's a 2,2. Similarly, rows might have sequences of 1s or 2s. Let's see how many times 1s or 2s appear consecutively in each row, then sum across the grid.\n\nWait, in Example 0's output, the first two elements are 1,1. Maybe that's the count of 1-pairs and 2-pairs. Let's count all the 1,1 sequences and 2,2 sequences in each row. Then sum across all rows.\n\nFor Example 0's input:\n\nFirst row: 2,2 (count 1 for 2s)\nSecond row: 1,1 (count 1 for 1s)\nThird row: 1,1 and 2,2 (1 each)\nFourth row: 2,2 (1)\nFifth row: 2,2 (1)\nSixth row: 2,2 and 1,1 (1 each)\nSeventh row: 1,1 (1)\nEighth row: nothing\nNinth row: ends with 1, but not a pair. Wait, the ninth row is [0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1]. No consecutive 1s.\n\nWait, let's recheck each row:\n\nRow 0: 2,2 \u2192 1 two-pair\nRow 1: 1,1 \u2192 1 one-pair\nRow 2: 1,1 and 2,2 \u2192 1 each\nRow3: 2,2 \u2192 1 two-pair\nRow4: 2,2 \u21921 two-pair\nRow5: 2,2 and 1,1 \u21921 each\nRow6: 1,1 \u21921 one-pair\nRow7: all zeros \u2192 none\nRow8: no consecutive 1s or 2s.\n\nSo total one-pairs: row1 (1), row2 (1), row5 (1), row6 (1) \u2192 total 4?\nTwo-pairs: row0 (1), row2 (1), row3 (1), row4 (1), row5 (1) \u2192 total 5?\n\nBut the output is [1,1,0,0,0]. Hmm, that doesn't align. Maybe I'm counting wrong. Let's recount.\n\nWait, maybe the output is the count of 1-pairs and 2-pairs, but in a specific order. Let's check the output of Example 0: [1,1,0,0,0]. That has five elements. Maybe each element represents a different count. Alternatively, perhaps the output is the counts of 1-pairs and 2-pairs in each column? Let me think differently.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each position in the output corresponds to a row in the input, but the output is shorter. Example 0's output has 5 elements. The input has 9 rows. That doesn't match. Maybe the output is based on the middle rows or columns. Alternatively, maybe it's the counts of 1s and 2s in certain positions.\n\nAnother angle: Let's check the output lengths. All outputs are 5 elements. So maybe the output is related to the first five rows or columns. Let's check the columns in Example 0.\n\nLooking at each column across the 9 rows. For example, column 0: 0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0. The 1 is in row4. Not sure. Alternatively, maybe each output element corresponds to a column's pair count. Let's see.\n\nWait, the first output in Example 0 is [1,1,0,0,0]. Maybe the first element is the count of 1-pairs in the entire grid, the second is 2-pairs, then the next elements are something else. Let's calculate for Example 0:\n\nTotal 1-pairs: rows 1,2,5,6 \u2192 4?\nTotal 2-pairs: rows 0,2,3,4,5 \u21925?\n\nBut the output starts with 1,1. That doesn't match. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe the output is the counts of 1-pairs and 2-pairs in each diagonal? Or perhaps in some other structure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's the number of times 1-pairs are followed by a 2-pair in the same row, or something like that. Let's check the input of Example 0 again.\n\nRow 0: 0,0,0,0,2,2,0,0,1 \u2192 2,2 (two-pair)\nRow1: 0,1,1,0,2,2,0,0,0 \u2192 1,1 and 2,2\nRow2: 0,1,1,0,0,0,0,2,2 \u21921,1 and 2,2\nRow3: 0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,2 \u21922,2\nRow4: 1,0,2,2,0,0,0,0,0 \u21922,2\nRow5:0,0,2,2,0,1,1,0,0 \u21922,2 and 1,1\nRow6: 0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0 \u21921,1\nRow7: all zeros\nRow8: 0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1 \u2192 no pairs.\n\nSo total 1-pairs: rows1,2,5,6 \u2192 4 instances. 2-pairs: rows0,1,2,3,4,5 \u2192 6 instances. But the output is [1,1,0,0,0]. This doesn't align. So maybe this approach is wrong.\n\nAlternative idea: Maybe the output is the counts of 1-pairs and 2-pairs in each of the 5 middle columns? But the output has 5 elements. Let's think of the grid as 9x9. The middle 5 columns? Let's see.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the count of pairs in each row, but only the first five rows. For Example0, let's check first five rows:\n\nRow0: 2,2 \u21921 two-pair\nRow1:1,1 and 2,2 \u21921 each\nRow2:1,1 and 2,2 \u21921 each\nRow3:2,2 \u21921 two-pair\nRow4:2,2 \u21921 two-pair\nSo first five rows have 1 one-pair (row1), and 2-pairs in rows0,1,2,3,4. That's 5 two-pairs. But the output starts with 1,1. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each element in the output is the number of rows that have a certain number of pairs. For example, the first element is how many rows have exactly one 1-pair, the second element how many rows have exactly one 2-pair, etc. But in Example0, let's see:\n\nRows with 1-pairs: rows1,2,5,6 \u21924 rows.\nRows with 2-pairs: rows0,1,2,3,4,5 \u21926 rows.\nBut output is [1,1,0,0,0]. Not matching.\n\nAnother approach: Maybe the output represents the counts of pairs in the entire grid, but grouped by their position. For example, how many times a 1-pair is followed by a 2-pair in the same row, or something like that. Let's check.\n\nLooking at Example0's rows:\n\nRow0: has a 2-pair, no 1-pair.\nRow1: has 1-pair followed by 2-pair.\nRow2: has 1-pair followed by 2-pair later.\nRow5: has 2-pair followed by 1-pair.\nHmm, maybe the first output element is the number of rows where 1-pair comes before 2-pair, the second element where 2-pair comes before 1-pair, etc. Let's count for Example0.\n\nRow1: 1-pair then 2-pair \u2192 contributes to first output element.\nRow2: 1-pair then 2-pair \u2192 another for first element.\nRow5: 2-pair then 1-pair \u2192 contributes to second element.\nOther rows with both pairs? Row0 only 2-pair. Row3 only 2-pair. Row4 only 2-pair. Row6 only 1-pair.\n\nSo in Example0, rows1 and 2 have 1-pair followed by 2-pair: count 2. Row5 has 2-pair followed by 1-pair: count1. But output is [1,1,0,0,0]. So that doesn't add up.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the number of 1-pairs and 2-pairs in the first five columns of each row. Let's check:\n\nFor each row, check columns 0-4 for consecutive pairs.\n\nExample0:\n\nRow0: 0,0,0,0,2 \u2192 columns 0-4: 0,0,0,0,2. Consecutive 0s but maybe only 0s. No 1 or 2 pairs in first 5 columns. The 2 is at position4, but not a pair.\n\nRow1: 0,1,1,0,2 \u2192 in first 5 columns, there's a 1,1 pair. So that's one 1-pair.\n\nRow2:0,1,1,0,0 \u2192 1,1 in first 5 columns \u2192 another 1-pair.\n\nRow3:0,0,0,0,0 \u2192 all 0s.\n\nRow4:1,0,2,2,0 \u2192 in first 5 columns, 2,2 is a pair. So one 2-pair.\n\nRow5:0,0,2,2,0 \u2192 in first 5, 2,2 \u2192 one 2-pair.\n\nRow6:0,0,0,0,0 \u2192 no.\n\nRow7: all 0s.\n\nRow8:0,1,0,0,0 \u2192 no pairs.\n\nSo total 1-pairs in first five columns: rows1 and 2 \u21922.\n\n2-pairs: rows4 and5 \u21922.\n\nBut the output is [1,1,0,0,0]. So 2 and 2, but output starts with 1,1. Not matching.\n\nHmm, maybe the output is the count of 1-pairs and 2-pairs in all possible consecutive pairs in the entire grid. Let's see:\n\nEach row has 8 possible consecutive pairs. For each row, count how many 1,1 and 2,2 pairs.\n\nIn Example0's input:\n\nRow0: positions4-5: 2,2 \u21921 two-pair.\n\nRow1: positions1-2:1,1; positions4-5:2,2 \u2192 1 and 1.\n\nRow2: positions1-2:1,1; positions7-8:2,2 \u21921 and 1.\n\nRow3: positions7-8:2,2 \u21921.\n\nRow4: positions2-3:2,2 \u21921.\n\nRow5: positions2-3:2,2; positions5-6:1,1 \u21921 and1.\n\nRow6: positions5-6:1,1 \u21921.\n\nRow7: no pairs.\n\nRow8: no pairs.\n\nTotal 1-pairs: rows1 (1), row2 (1), row5 (1), row6 (1) \u21924.\n\nTotal 2-pairs: rows0 (1), row1 (1), row2 (1), row3 (1), row4 (1), row5 (1) \u21926.\n\nBut the output is [1,1,0,0,0]. So this approach doesn't explain it. Maybe the output isn't about pairs of numbers but something else.\n\nAlternative idea: The output could represent the number of times a 1 is followed by a 0, or other transitions. But that seems vague.\n\nWait, looking at the output for Example0: [1,1,0,0,0]. The first two elements are 1,1. Maybe each element represents a row's transformation. But how?\n\nWait, let's check the lengths. The input is 9 rows, output is 5 elements. Maybe the output is the sum of certain elements in each row, but summed across columns. For example, each output element is the sum of a particular column across all rows. But 9 rows summed into 5 elements? Maybe grouped columns. Like columns 0-1 sum to first output element, columns 2-3 to the second, etc. But 9 columns can't be split into 5 groups. Alternatively, the middle five columns?\n\nAlternatively, each output element represents the number of rows where a certain pattern occurs. For example, first element is the number of rows where a 1-pair occurs, second where a 2-pair occurs, etc. But Example0's output is [1,1,0,0,0], which would suggest that only one row has a 1-pair and one has a 2-pair. But earlier counts were higher, so this doesn't fit.\n\nAnother angle: Maybe the output is the count of certain configurations in the grid, like how many L-shapes or other structures. But this seems complex.\n\nLet's look at another example. Example1's output is [1,1,1,1,0]. Let's check its input.\n\nLooking at the input for Example1:\n\nRow0: [1,1,0,2,0,0,0,0,2] \u2192 1,1 and then a 2 later (but not consecutive).\n\nRow1: [1,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0] \u2192 two 1-pairs (positions0-1 and5-6).\n\nRow2: [0,0,0,2,0,1,1,0,0] \u2192 1-pair at positions5-6.\n\nRow3: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1] \u2192 no pairs.\n\nRow4: [0,1,1,0,2,2,0,0,0] \u21921-pair and 2-pair.\n\nRow5: [0,1,1,0,2,2,0,0,2] \u21921-pair, 2-pair.\n\nRow6: all zeros.\n\nRow7: [0,0,0,2,2,0,1,1,0] \u21922-pair and 1-pair.\n\nRow8: [0,1,0,2,2,0,1,1,0] \u21922-pair and 1-pair.\n\nSo total 1-pairs: row0 (1), row1 (2), row2 (1), row4 (1), row5 (1), row7 (1), row8 (1) \u2192 total 7?\n\n2-pairs: row4 (1), row5 (1), row7 (1), row8 (1) \u21924?\n\nBut output is [1,1,1,1,0]. So again, not matching counts.\n\nAlternative approach: Maybe the output is the counts of occurrences where a 1-pair is immediately followed by a 0 and a 2-pair in the same row. But that's too specific.\n\nWait, perhaps the output represents the number of times a certain combination of 1-pairs and 2-pairs appear across all rows. For example, the first element is how many rows have exactly one 1-pair, the second element rows with one 2-pair, etc. Let's try this for Example0.\n\nIn Example0, rows with exactly one 1-pair: rows1,2,5,6 \u21924 rows. Rows with exactly one 2-pair: rows0,3,4 \u21923 rows. Rows with two pairs (1-pair and 2-pair): rows1,2,5 \u21923 rows. So output elements could be counts for 0,1,2 pairs per row, but the output has 5 elements. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the output could be the count of different types of pairs per some criteria. For example, the first element is the number of 1-pairs in even rows, the second in odd rows, then similarly for 2-pairs, etc. But Example0 has 9 rows (even and odd indexed 0-8). Even rows (0,2,4,6,8):\n\nRow0 (even): 2-pair \u21921.\nRow2 (even): 1-pair and 2-pair \u21922 pairs.\nRow4 (even): 2-pair \u21921.\nRow6 (even):1-pair \u21921.\nRow8 (even): no pairs.\n\nTotal 1-pairs in even rows: row2 and row6 \u21922.\n2-pairs in even rows: row0, row2, row4 \u21923.\n\nOdd rows (1,3,5,7):\n\nRow1:1-pair and 2-pair \u21922.\nRow3:2-pair \u21921.\nRow5:2-pair and 1-pair \u21922.\nRow7: none.\n\nTotal 1-pairs in odd rows: row1 and row5 \u21922.\n2-pairs in odd rows: row1, row3, row5 \u21923.\n\nBut the output is [1,1,0,0,0]. Doesn't match.\n\nAnother idea: The output could be the sum of the digits in each of the first five columns. For Example0:\n\nLet's sum columns 0-4 for each row:\n\nRow0: 0+0+0+0+2=2\nRow1:0+1+1+0+2=4\nRow2:0+1+1+0+0=2\nRow3:0+0+0+0+0=0\nRow4:1+0+2+2+0=5\nRow5:0+0+2+2+0=4\nRow6:0+0+0+0+0=0\nRow7:0+0+0+0+0=0\nRow8:0+1+0+0+0=1\n\nSumming each column 0-4 across all rows:\n\nColumn0: 0+0+0+0+1+0+0+0+0 =1\nColumn1:0+1+1+0+0+0+0+0+1=3\nColumn2:0+1+1+0+2+2+0+0+0=6\nColumn3:0+0+0+0+2+2+0+0+0=4\nColumn4:2+2+0+0+0+0+0+0+0=4\n\nBut output is [1,1,0,0,0]. These sums don't match. \n\nAlternative idea: Maybe the output is the count of islands of 1s and 2s. An island is a group of connected 1s or 2s. But considering the grids as 2D arrays, perhaps the output is the number of islands of 1s and 2s. But the output has 5 elements. Let's check.\n\nExample0's input:\n\nLooking for connected regions of 1s and 2s. Let's see:\n\nRow0: 2s at positions4-5.\nRow1: 1s at 1-2, 2s at4-5.\nRow2:1s at1-2, 2s at7-8.\nRow3:2s at7-8.\nRow4:2s at2-3.\nRow5:2s at2-3, 1s at5-6.\nRow6:1s at5-6.\nRow8:1s at position1 and8 (not connected).\n\nSo islands of 1s:\n\nRow1's 1s (positions1-2) \u2192 one island.\nRow2's 1s (1-2) \u2192 connected to row1? No, because row1's 1s are in row1, columns1-2. Row2's 1s are row2, columns1-2. So vertically adjacent. So this forms a 2x2 block, making one island.\n\nSimilarly, row5's 1s (5-6), row6's 1s (5-6). If they are connected vertically, that's another island.\n\nRow8 has two 1s but not connected.\n\nSo total 1 islands for 1s:\n\nWait, rows1 and2 have 1s in columns1-2. Are they adjacent vertically? Yes. So that's a single island.\n\nRows5 and6: row5's 1s are at columns5-6, row6's are same columns. So vertically connected. Another island.\n\nRow8's 1s are isolated. So two separate 1s. So three islands of 1s.\n\nFor 2s:\n\nRow0's 2s at4-5.\nRow1's 2s at4-5, connected to row0's? No, row1's 4-5 are same columns but row0's are above. So connected vertically. So row0,1's 2s form an island.\n\nRow2's 2s at7-8.\n\nRow3's 2s at7-8 (same columns as row2's, but row3 is below row2. Are they adjacent? Row2's 2s are at row2, columns7-8. Row3's are row3, columns7-8. So connected. So rows2-3 2s form an island.\n\nRow4's 2s at2-3.\n\nRow5's 2s at2-3.\n\nRow4 and5's 2s: same columns, adjacent rows \u2192 connected. So another island.\n\nRow7 and8: any 2s? In example0's input, row7 is all zeros, row8 no 2s.\n\nSo total 2s islands:\n\n- rows0-1's 2s (columns4-5) \u2192 one island.\n\n- rows2-3's 2s (columns7-8) \u2192 another island.\n\n- rows4-5's 2s (columns2-3) \u2192 third island.\n\nSo three islands of 2s.\n\nBut the output is [1,1,0,0,0]. So maybe the first element is the number of 1-islands, the second 2-islands. But Example0's output starts with 1,1. But according to my count, 3 1-islands and 3 2-islands. Doesn't match.\n\nHmm, perhaps the islands are counted differently. Maybe diagonals don't connect, only horizontal and vertical. Let's recount:\n\nFor 1s in Example0:\n\nRow1's 1s at columns1-2. Row2's 1s at columns1-2. Adjacent rows, same columns \u2192 connected. So that's one island.\n\nRow5's 1s at columns5-6 (row5). Row6's 1s at columns5-6 (row6). Connected \u2192 another island.\n\nRow8's 1s at columns1 and8 (row8). Each is separate, so two more islands. So total four 1-islands.\n\nFor 2s:\n\nRow0's 2s at4-5. Row1's 2s at4-5. Connected \u2192 one island.\n\nRow2's 2s at7-8. Row3's 2s at7-8. Connected \u2192 second island.\n\nRow4's 2s at2-3. Row5's 2s at2-3. Connected \u2192 third island.\n\nSo three 2-islands.\n\nSo output would need to represent these counts. But Example0's output is [1,1,0,0,0], which would suggest one 1-island and one 2-island. Doesn't match. So this approach is likely wrong.\n\nAlternative idea: Maybe the output represents the number of times a certain pattern occurs in the grid. For example, each element in the output corresponds to a different pattern. Let's compare the outputs of the examples.\n\nAll three training examples have outputs of length 5. Example0 is [1,1,0,0,0], Examples1 and 2 are [1,1,1,1,0]. So the last element is 0 in all cases. Maybe the first four elements are counts of different patterns, and the last is something else.\n\nAnother possibility: The output is related to the number of times a 1-pair and a 2-pair appear in the same row. For example, the first element is the count of rows with both 1-pair and 2-pair. Let's check.\n\nExample0:\n\nRows with both pairs: rows1,2,5 \u2192 three rows. So output starts with 3. But Example0's output is [1,1,0,0,0]. Doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, the output elements could be the counts of certain row configurations:\n\n- Element0: rows with only 1-pairs.\n\n- Element1: rows with only 2-pairs.\n\n- Element2: rows with both 1 and 2-pairs.\n\n- Element3: rows with neither.\n\n- Element4: ?\n\nExample0:\n\nRows with only 1-pairs: rows6 \u2192 count 1.\n\nRows with only 2-pairs: rows0,3,4 \u2192 count3.\n\nRows with both: rows1,2,5 \u2192 count3.\n\nRows with neither: rows7,8 \u2192 count2.\n\nBut output is [1,1,0,0,0]. Not matching.\n\nAnother angle: Looking at the test input. Let's see if I can find any pattern there once I figure out the training examples.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the counts of 1s and 2s in specific positions. For example, the first element is the number of 1s in the first column, second is 2s in first column, etc. But with 5 elements, not sure.\n\nWait, let's look at the outputs again. Example0's output is [1,1,0,0,0]. Example1 and 2 have [1,1,1,1,0]. Maybe the elements represent the number of times a certain sequence of three numbers appears. For example, 1-1-0, or 2-2-0. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the number of times each of the first five rows contains a specific pattern. For example, each output element corresponds to a row (first five rows), and the value is 1 if the row contains a 1-pair, 0 otherwise. Then the output would be [1,1,1,1,0], but Example0's output starts with 1,1. Let's check:\n\nExample0's first five rows:\n\nRow0: contains a 2-pair \u2192 maybe 0.\n\nRow1: contains 1-pair and 2-pair \u2192 maybe 1.\n\nRow2: same as row1 \u21921.\n\nRow3: 2-pair \u21920.\n\nRow4: 2-pair \u21920.\n\nSo the first five elements would be [0,1,1,0,0]. Not matching the output [1,1,0,0,0].\n\nAnother idea: Maybe each output element represents the count of 1s and 2s in each of the first five rows, but in a specific way. For example, the first element is the number of 1-pairs in row0, the second element 2-pairs in row0, then row1, etc. But since the output has 5 elements, it might cover the first five rows' pairs.\n\nExample0's first five rows:\n\nRow0: 2-pair \u2192 0,1 (if first element is 1-pairs count for row0, 0. Second element 2-pairs, 1. But output starts with 1,1. Hmm, maybe each output element is the sum across all rows for each pair type in a certain position.\n\nAlternatively, the output could be the number of times a certain pattern appears in each of the first five columns. For example, in column0, how many times a 1-pair appears vertically. Let's check.\n\nExample0's column0:\n\n0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0 \u2192 no consecutive 1s or 2s.\n\nSo no pairs. So output element0 would be 0. But Example0's output starts with 1. So this is not it.\n\nAt this point, I'm stuck. Maybe I should look for another approach. Let's think about the numbers in the output. Example0 has [1,1,0,0,0], which has two 1s and three 0s. Examples1 and 2 have four 1s and one 0. So maybe the output is the count of certain conditions being met in each of five possible positions.\n\nWait, the output length is 5. Maybe it's related to the five middle columns (columns 2-6) or something. Let's think.\n\nAnother idea: The output represents the number of times a 1-pair is followed by a 2-pair in the same row, with exactly one zero in between. For example, the sequence 1,1,0,2,2. Let's check Example0's rows:\n\nRow1: 0,1,1,0,2,2. Here, after the 1-pair (positions1-2), there's a 0, then 2-pair. So this fits. So count as 1 for the first element. If this is the pattern, then the first element of the output is the count of such occurrences. Similarly, the second element might be other patterns.\n\nBut how would this explain the output length of 5?\n\nAlternatively, the output elements could be flags (1 or 0) indicating whether certain conditions are met. For example:\n\n- Element0: exists a row where a 1-pair is followed by a 2-pair.\n\n- Element1: exists a row where a 2-pair is followed by a 1-pair.\n\n- Element2: exists a row where a 1-pair and 2-pair are adjacent.\n\n- Etc.\n\nBut for Example0, row1 has 1-pair followed by 2-pair \u2192 element0 is 1. Row5 has 2-pair followed by 1-pair \u2192 element1 is 1. Other elements might check other conditions. If the output is [1,1,0,0,0], that could fit. Then in Example1 and 2, maybe those flags are more.\n\nBut how to determine which conditions each output element represents. For example0, elements0 and1 are 1, others 0. So perhaps elements0 and1 are the two conditions mentioned. \n\nTesting this for Example1:\n\nLooking for rows where 1-pair is followed by 2-pair and vice versa.\n\nExample1's input rows:\n\nRow0: 1,1,0,2,0,0,0,0,2 \u2192 1-pair then no 2-pair immediately.\n\nRow1: 1,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0 \u2192 two 1-pairs.\n\nRow4: 0,1,1,0,2,2,0,0,0 \u21921-pair followed by 2-pair \u2192 condition for element0.\n\nRow5:0,1,1,0,2,2,0,0,2 \u21921-pair followed by 2-pair \u2192 element0.\n\nRow7:0,0,0,2,2,0,1,1,0 \u21922-pair followed by 1-pair \u2192 element1.\n\nRow8:0,1,0,2,2,0,1,1,0 \u21922-pair followed by 1-pair \u2192 element1.\n\nSo element0 would be 2 (rows4 and5), element1 would be 2 (rows7 and8). But output is [1,1,1,1,0]. This doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. Maybe each element represents a different row. For example, output element0 corresponds to row0, element1 to row1, etc. But output has 5 elements for 9 rows. Not matching.\n\nWait, maybe the output is the counts of 1-pairs and 2-pairs in the first five rows, then the next three, and so on. Not sure.\n\nAnother possible approach: The output could be the number of times each of the first five columns have a 1-pair or 2-pair in any row. For example, column0: check if there are consecutive 1s or 2s. But since columns are vertical, consecutive in rows would require two consecutive rows having the same number. For example, in column0, if two consecutive rows have 1 in the same column, that's a vertical pair. Let's check Example0's column0:\n\nRows are:\n\n0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0 \u2192 column0 is [0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0]. Are there consecutive 1s? No. Consecutive 0s: yes, multiple times. But maybe we're looking for vertical pairs of 1s or 2s.\n\nIn column0 of Example0, there are no vertical 1-pairs or 2-pairs. Let's check other columns.\n\nExample0's column1:\n\n0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1.\n\nLooking for consecutive 1s. Rows1 and2 have 1s in column1. Row1:1, row2:1 \u2192 consecutive rows. So that's a vertical 1-pair. Similarly, rows8 has 1, but not consecutive.\n\nSo column1 has one vertical 1-pair.\n\nSimilarly, column2:\n\n0,1,1,0,2,2,0,0,0.\n\nRow1 and2 have 1s \u2192 vertical pair. Row4 and5 have 2s \u2192 vertical pair. So two vertical pairs (one 1s, one 2s).\n\nBut the output has 5 elements. So maybe each element corresponds to a column's count of vertical pairs. For Example0:\n\nColumns0-4:\n\nColumn0: no pairs.\n\nColumn1: one 1-pair.\n\nColumn2: one 1-pair and one 2-pair (but since vertical pairs are two consecutive rows, maybe each pair is counted once per column).\n\nColumn3: all zeros.\n\nColumn4: in row0:2, row1:2. Consecutive rows? Row0 and1's column4: 2 and 2 \u2192 vertical 2-pair.\n\nSo column4 has a vertical 2-pair.\n\nSo for columns0-4:\n\n0 pairs in column0.\n\n1 1-pair in column1.\n\n1 1-pair and 1 2-pair in column2.\n\n0 in column3.\n\n1 2-pair in column4.\n\nBut output is [1,1,0,0,0]. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each output element is the count of vertical 1-pairs and 2-pairs in each of the first five columns. For example, column0:0, column1:1, column2:2, column3:0, column4:1. But how to get to [1,1,0,0,0]. Maybe the output is the sum of 1-pairs and 2-pairs per column. So for column1:1 (1-pair), column2:2 (1-pair and 2-pair), column4:1 (2-pair). But output is five elements. This approach doesn't align.\n\nI'm struggling to find a pattern here. Let me try to think of another angle. Maybe the output is the number of times a 1 or 2 appears in certain positions of the grid. For example, the center cell, or the corners. But output has 5 elements. \n\nAlternatively, the output represents the number of times the digits 1 and 2 appear in the main diagonal. For a 9x9 grid, the main diagonal would have 9 elements. But the output has 5 elements. Maybe the first five elements of the diagonal. Let's check Example0's main diagonal (positions [0][0], [1][1], ..., [8][8]):\n\nDiag0:0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1 \u2192 digits are 0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1. So the first five elements are 0,1,1,0,0. How many 1s here? Two. But output starts with 1,1. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the output is the count of 1s and 2s in the diagonal. For Example0's first five diagonal elements: 0,1,1,0,0. So two 1s. Output starts with 1,1. Maybe first element is 1s count (2), second is 2s count (0). But Example0's output has first two elements as 1,1. Not matching.\n\nAnother idea: The output is the parity (even or odd) of the number of 1s and 2s in each of five sections of the grid. For example, divided into five regions. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the output is the counts of 1-pairs and 2-pairs in the entire grid, but with some grouping. For example, the first element is the number of 1-pairs, the second 2-pairs, and the rest zero. But Example0's 1-pairs count is 4, which would require first element 4. But output starts with 1,1.\n\nWait, maybe the output is not the total count, but the number of rows that have at least one 1-pair or 2-pair. For Example0:\n\nRows with at least one 1-pair: rows1,2,5,6 \u21924.\n\nRows with at least one 2-pair: rows0,1,2,3,4,5 \u21926.\n\nBut output is [1,1,0,0,0]. Doesn't match.\n\nAlternative approach: Maybe the output is based on the frequency of certain numbers. For instance, the first element is the number of times 1 appears, the second the number of times 2 appears, then some other metrics. But Example0's input has:\n\nCount of 1s: Let's see:\n\nRow0:0,0,0,0,2,2,0,0,1 \u2192 one 1.\n\nRow1:0,1,1,0,2,2,0,0,0 \u2192 two 1s.\n\nRow2:0,1,1,0,0,0,0,2,2 \u2192 two 1s.\n\nRow3: no 1s.\n\nRow4:1,0,2,2,0,0,0,0,0 \u2192 one 1.\n\nRow5:0,0,2,2,0,1,1,0,0 \u2192 two 1s.\n\nRow6:0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0 \u2192 two 1s.\n\nRow7: no 1s.\n\nRow8:0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1 \u2192 two 1s.\n\nTotal 1s: 1+2+2+1+2+2+2 = 12.\n\nCount of 2s: similarly, let's count.\n\nRow0: two 2s.\n\nRow1: two 2s.\n\nRow2: two 2s.\n\nRow3: two 2s.\n\nRow4: two 2s.\n\nRow5: two 2s.\n\nRow6: none.\n\nRow7: none.\n\nRow8: none.\n\nTotal 2s: 2*6=12.\n\nBut output is [1,1,0,0,0], which doesn't relate to these counts.\n\nAnother possibility: The output represents the number of times a 1 or 2 appears in the fifth position (index4) of each row. Let's check:\n\nFor Example0:\n\nRow0's fifth element (index4) is 2.\n\nRow1's: 2.\n\nRow2's:0.\n\nRow3's:0.\n\nRow4's:0.\n\nRow5's:0.\n\nRow6's:0.\n\nRow7's:0.\n\nRow8's:0.\n\nSo count of 1s in fifth position: 0.\n\nCount of 2s:2 (rows0 and1).\n\nBut output starts with 1,1. Not sure.\n\nAfter trying multiple approaches without success, I think I need to look for a different pattern. Let me think of the output as a binary representation. [1,1,0,0,0] could be 11000 in binary, which is 24. But what significance does 24 have here?\n\nAlternatively, the output could represent the number of times certain transitions occur between consecutive rows. For example, from row0 to row1, row1 to row2, etc., count how many times a 1-pair turns into a 2-pair or vice versa. But this seems complex.\n\nWait, looking at the test input and trying to find a pattern. Let's see the test input:\n\nTest Input rows:\n\nRow0: [0,0,0,0,0,2,2,0,1] \u2192 2-pair at5-6.\n\nRow1: [1,1,0,1,0,2,2,0,0] \u21921-pair at0-1, 2-pair at5-6.\n\nRow2: [1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0] \u21921-pair at0-1.\n\nRow3: [0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0] \u21921-pair at5-6.\n\nRow4: [0,2,2,0,0,1,1,0,0] \u21922-pair at1-2, 1-pair at5-6.\n\nRow5: [0,2,2,0,0,0,0,0,0] \u21922-pair at1-2.\n\nRow6: [1,0,0,0,0,0,2,2,0] \u21922-pair at6-7.\n\nRow7: [2,2,0,1,1,0,2,2,0] \u21922-pair at0-1, 1-pair at3-4, 2-pair at6-7.\n\nRow8: [2,2,0,1,1,0,0,0,0] \u21922-pair at0-1, 1-pair at3-4.\n\nSo for the test input:\n\nCount of 1-pairs: rows1 (0-1), row2 (0-1), row3 (5-6), row4 (5-6), row7 (3-4), row8 (3-4) \u21926.\n\nCount of 2-pairs: rows0 (5-6), row1 (5-6), row4 (1-2), row5 (1-2), row6 (6-7), row7 (0-1,6-7), row8 (0-1) \u2192 rows0:1, row1:1, row4:1, row5:1, row6:1, row7:2, row8:1. Total 8.\n\nBut the output of the test input would need to follow the pattern from training examples. The training examples' outputs are of the form [1s, 1s, 0s...]. Maybe the output is the number of rows that have both a 1-pair and a 2-pair. Let's check for the training examples:\n\nExample0:\n\nRows1,2,5 have both. So 3 rows. But output is [1,1,0,0,0], which doesn't match.\n\nExample1:\n\nRows4,5,7,8 have both 1-pair and 2-pair. So four rows. Output is [1,1,1,1,0]. So maybe each element represents a count of a certain row type, like the number of rows with exactly one 1-pair and one 2-pair. For Example0, 3 such rows \u2192 output would have a higher first element. Doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, each output element is a binary flag indicating whether a certain condition is met in the grid. For example, first element is 1 if there's at least one row with both pairs, else 0. In Example0, that's true (rows1,2,5), so element0 is 1. Similarly, element1 could be 1 if there's a row with two 1-pairs. For Example0, row1 has two pairs (1-pair and 2-pair), not two 1-pairs. Wait, row1 has one 1-pair and one 2-pair. So no. Example1's row1 has two 1-pairs. So element1 would be 1. But Example1's output is [1,1,1,1,0]. Maybe each element corresponds to different conditions:\n\n- element0: exists a row with both 1-pair and 2-pair.\n\n- element1: exists a row with two 1-pairs.\n\n- element2: exists a row with two 2-pairs.\n\n- element3: exists a row with three or more pairs.\n\n- element4: something else.\n\nIn Example0:\n\nelement0: yes (rows1,2,5) \u21921.\n\nelement1: no rows with two 1-pairs \u21920.\n\nelement2: no rows with two 2-pairs \u21920.\n\nelement3: no \u21920.\n\nelement4: ?\n\nBut output is [1,1,0,0,0]. So this doesn't fit.\n\nIn Example1:\n\nrow1 has two 1-pairs \u2192 element1=1.\n\nrow5 has two 2-pairs (positions4-5 and8 is 2 alone). No, row5: 0,1,1,0,2,2,0,0,2. 2-pairs at4-5 and a single 2 at8. So one 2-pair.\n\nSo element2 would be 0. But Example1's output has elements0-3 as 1. So this approach doesn't work.\n\nAt this point, I'm really stuck. Maybe the pattern is simpler. Let's look at the outputs again. All training examples have outputs starting with at least two 1s. Example0 has two 1s followed by zeros. Examples1 and2 have four 1s. The test input has several pairs, so maybe the output is [1,1,1,1,0]. But I need to find the right logic.\n\nAnother idea: The output could be the counts of how many times each of the first five rows contain a 1-pair or a 2-pair. For example, for each of the first five rows, 1 if there's a 1-pair, 2 if 2-pair, 0 otherwise. Then sum or something. But output is five elements.\n\nExample0's first five rows:\n\nRow0: 2-pair \u21922.\n\nRow1: both \u21921+2=3.\n\nRow2: both \u21923.\n\nRow3:2-pair \u21922.\n\nRow4:2-pair \u21922.\n\nBut output is [1,1,0,0,0]. Not matching.\n\nAlternatively, for each of the first five rows, 1 if there's a 1-pair, 1 if there's a 2-pair, sum them per column. Not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps each output element corresponds to the presence of a 1-pair or 2-pair in the first five rows. For example:\n\nElement0: 1 if there's a 1-pair in row0, else 0.\n\nElement1: 1 if there's a 2-pair in row0, else 0.\n\nElement2: row1's 1-pair presence.\n\nElement3: row1's 2-pair presence.\n\nElement4: row2's 1-pair presence.\n\nBut this would require more than five elements. Not matching.\n\nAlternatively, the output elements represent the presence of 1-pairs and 2-pairs in the first five rows in sequence. For example, first element is 1 if row0 has a 1-pair, second element 1 if row0 has a 2-pair, third element row1's 1-pair, fourth row1's 2-pair, fifth row2's 1-pair. But Example0's output is [1,1,0,0,0].\n\nRow0: has 2-pair \u2192 element0:0, element1:1.\n\nRow1: has 1-pair and 2-pair \u2192 element2:1, element3:1.\n\nRow2: has both \u2192 element4:1.\n\nBut output is [1,1,0,0,0]. Doesn't fit.\n\nI'm running out of ideas. Maybe the pattern is about the number of times the digits 1 and 2 appear in the same row. For example, a row containing both 1 and 2. In Example0, how many rows have both 1 and 2:\n\nRow0: 2 and 1 (at end) \u2192 yes.\n\nRow1: 1 and 2 \u2192 yes.\n\nRow2:1 and 2 \u2192 yes.\n\nRow5:1 and 2 \u2192 yes.\n\nSo four rows. Output starts with 1,1. Not matching.\n\nAlternatively, the output is the number of rows where 1-pair occurs before 2-pair, then vice versa, but again, the output length doesn't fit.\n\nMaybe the pattern is not about pairs but about the presence of certain numbers in the grid's diagonals. Let me check the main diagonal and anti-diagonal.\n\nExample0's main diagonal:\n\nRow0[0] =0\n\nRow1[1]=1\n\nRow2[2]=1\n\nRow3[3]=0\n\nRow4[4]=0\n\nRow5[5]=1\n\nRow6[6]=0\n\nRow7[7]=0\n\nRow8[8]=1\n\nSo diagonal:0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,1. The number of 1s here is 4. Output is [1,1,0,0,0]. Not sure.\n\nAnti-diagonal (elements from top-right to bottom-left):\n\nRow0[8]=1\n\nRow1[7]=0\n\nRow2[6]=0\n\nRow3[5]=0\n\nRow4[4]=0\n\nRow5[3]=0\n\nRow6[2]=0\n\nRow7[1]=0\n\nRow8[0]=0\n\nAnti-diagonal:1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0. Only one 1.\n\nBut output is [1,1,0,0,0]. Not matching.\n\nAt this point, I'm stuck. Maybe I need to look for a different approach. Perhaps the output is related to the number of times a 1-pair is followed by a 0 and then a 2-pair in the same row. For Example0's row1:1,1,0,2,2. So this pattern exists. Count of such instances. Example0's output starts with 1, maybe indicating one such occurrence. Let's check other examples.\n\nExample0 has row1 and row2 with this pattern. So count 2, but output is 1. So not matching.\n\nAnother possibility: The output is the number of rows where the sum of 1s and 2s is even or odd. But with five elements, not sure.\n\nGiven that I'm not able to find the pattern despite trying various approaches, I might need to make an educated guess based on the test input and the training examples. \n\nLooking at the test input's rows, there are multiple rows with both 1-pairs and 2-pairs. For example, row1 has 1-pair and 2-pair. row4 has both. row7 has 2-pair, 1-pair, and another 2-pair. row8 has both. So perhaps the output is the number of such rows, but the training examples' outputs don't align with this. \n\nAlternatively, the output could be the count of how many times the digits 1 and 2 appear in the same column. For example, in a column, if there's a 1 and a 2, count that. But how this translates to five elements.\n\nGiven that I'm running out of time and need to provide an answer, I'll make a guess based on the examples. The test input has multiple rows with both 1-pairs and 2-pairs. Looking at the training examples, Example1 and 2 have outputs of [1,1,1,1,0], while Example0 has [1,1,0,0,0]. Maybe the output counts the number of rows where a 1-pair is followed by a 2-pair, and other conditions. Given the test input has several such rows, I'll guess the output is [1,1,1,1,0]."
