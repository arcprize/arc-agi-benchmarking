        "cot_1": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. So, the input is a 3x3 grid (three rows of three numbers each), and the output is a 6x6 grid. Hmm, maybe it's some kind of expansion where each input element is transformed into a 2x2 block in the output? Because 3x3 input to 6x6 output would mean each input cell becomes a 2x2 cell in the output.\n\nLooking at Example 0:\n\nInput:\nRow 0: [8,5,0]\nRow 1: [8,5,3]\nRow 2: [0,3,2]\n\nOutput is 6 rows. Let's see if each input element is expanded. For instance, the first input element is 8. Let's check where 8 appears in the output. The first row of output is [8,5,0,0,8,8]. Wait, maybe the output is arranged as a combination of the original rows and their transformations. Or perhaps the output is the original grid mirrored in some way.\n\nLooking closer at Example 0's output:\n\nThe output has six rows. Let's break it down. The first three rows of the output might be the original rows expanded. Then the next three could be a transformation. Alternatively, maybe each input row is processed into two output rows.\n\nWait, let's take the first input row of Example 0: [8,5,0]. The output first row is [8,5,0,0,8,8]. The second output row is [8,5,3,3,5,5]. Wait, that's the second input row. Then the third output row is [0,3,2,2,3,0]. Then the next three rows are again similar but maybe mirrored or rotated.\n\nLooking at the fourth row of Example 0's output: [0,3,2,2,3,0], which is the same as the third input row but reversed? Wait, the third input row is [0,3,2]. The output's third row is [0,3,2,2,3,0], which is the original row followed by reversed elements except the middle? Wait, the third input row is [0,3,2], and the third output row adds [2,3,0] reversed? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each input row is transformed into two output rows. For example, in Example 0, the first input row [8,5,0] becomes two output rows: [8,5,0,0,8,8] and then [8,5,3,3,5,5], but wait that's from the second input row. Hmm, perhaps not.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is constructed by mirroring the input grid. Let's see. The input is 3x3. The output is 6x6. So maybe each element is duplicated in a certain way. For example, each element in the input grid is replicated into a 2x2 block in the output. But the output's elements don't exactly replicate that. Let's check.\n\nTake the first input element of Example 0, which is 8. In the output, the first element is 8. Then the next element is 5, then 0. Then after that, 0, 8, 8. So perhaps each row is mirrored and combined with another transformation.\n\nWait, looking at the first output row of Example 0: [8,5,0,0,8,8]. The first three elements are the original input row [8,5,0], then followed by 0,8,8. Wait, the last three elements are [0,8,8], which is the reverse of the first three but with some modification. Wait, the original is 8,5,0. Reversed is 0,5,8. But the output's last three are 0,8,8. Hmm, not exactly reversed.\n\nAnother approach: Maybe the output is combining the original grid with its rotations or reflections. For example, the first three rows of the output could be the original grid with some transformation, and the next three rows are another transformation. Let's check the rows.\n\nIn Example 0's output:\n\nRow 0: [8,5,0,0,8,8] \u2013 first three elements are the first input row. The next three might be from another part.\n\nRow 1: [8,5,3,3,5,5] \u2013 first three are the second input row. Then next three.\n\nRow 2: [0,3,2,2,3,0] \u2013 third input row followed by [2,3,0], which is reversed except the middle.\n\nThen Row 3: [0,3,2,2,3,0] \u2013 same as row 2, maybe?\n\nRow 4: [5,5,3,3,5,8] \u2013 this looks different. Maybe some mirroring.\n\nRow 5: [8,8,0,0,5,8] \u2013 starts with 8,8,0, then 0,5,8.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each of the original rows is mirrored and combined with another row. Let's see. For the first input row [8,5,0], the output row is [8,5,0,0,8,8]. The last three elements are 0,8,8. Which could be the original row's last element (0) followed by the first element (8) and then the second (5) perhaps? Not exactly. Alternatively, maybe the last three are some transformation based on the next rows.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is the original grid followed by a transformed version. For instance, the first three rows of the output could be the original rows with some appended elements, and the next three rows are transformations.\n\nLooking at Example 0's output, the first three output rows have the first three elements matching the input rows. Then the next three elements in each row might be generated from some pattern. Let's take the first output row: [8,5,0,0,8,8]. The first three are the input's first row. The next three are 0,8,8. The 0 is the third element of the first input row. The 8 and 8 might be from the first element of the first row. Not sure.\n\nLooking at the second output row of Example 0: [8,5,3,3,5,5]. First three elements are the second input row. Then 3,5,5. The 3 is the third element of the second input row. Then 5 and 5 might be the first and second elements of the second input row (8,5,3) \u2192 5 comes from the second element. Hmm, maybe the next three elements are [third element, second element, second element]?\n\nWait, in the first output row, the next three elements after [8,5,0] are [0,8,8]. The third element is 0, then the first element is 8, then 8 again. So for each input row, the next three elements are [third element, first element, first element]. Let's check.\n\nFor Example 0's first input row [8,5,0], third element is 0. So next three elements would be 0,8,8. Which matches the first output row. Then the second input row [8,5,3], third element is 3. So next three would be 3,8,8? But the output is 3,5,5. Hmm, that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the next three elements are the reverse of the row with some duplication. For the first row [8,5,0], reverse is [0,5,8], but the output's next three are [0,8,8]. So maybe take the third element, then first, then first again. So 0,8,8. For the second row [8,5,3], third element is 3, then first is 8, then 8 again. But the output has 3,5,5. So that's not matching. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the next three elements are a combination of elements from the same column. Let's think in terms of columns. The input is three rows, three columns. The output is six rows, six columns. Maybe each column in the input is expanded into two columns in the output. For example, each input column becomes two columns by some transformation.\n\nBut in the output, each row has six elements. So perhaps each input row is split into two parts. Wait, perhaps the first three elements of each output row are the input row, and the next three are a transformation based on that row and possibly others.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is a combination of the original grid and its transpose or other matrix operations. For example, the first three rows could be the original grid with some appended elements, and the next three rows could be the transpose or a rotated version.\n\nLooking at Example 0's output, rows 3 to 5: \n\nRow 3: [0,3,2,2,3,0] \u2013 same as row 2.\n\nRow 4: [5,5,3,3,5,8] \u2013 elements are 5,5,3, then 3,5,8. Maybe related to the middle row or column.\n\nRow 5: [8,8,0,0,5,8] \u2013 elements 8,8,0, then 0,5,8. This looks similar to the first row's next three elements.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is constructed by taking each input row and creating two output rows. For instance, each input row leads to two output rows. Since there are three input rows, that would make six output rows. Let's check:\n\nIn Example 0, input has three rows. Output has six rows.\n\nLooking at input row 0 [8,5,0]. Output row 0 is [8,5,0,0,8,8]. Maybe row 0 is input row 0 followed by some elements, and row 3 is another transformation. Wait, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, each input row is processed into two output rows. For example:\n\nFirst input row [8,5,0] becomes first two output rows. Wait no, in Example 0's output, the first two rows are [8,5,0,0,8,8] and [8,5,3,3,5,5], which are from input rows 0 and 1. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, each input row is used to generate two output rows. For example, input row 0 generates output row 0 and row 3. Let's check:\n\nIn Example 0, input row 0 is [8,5,0]. Output row 0 is [8,5,0,0,8,8], row 3 is [0,3,2,2,3,0]. That doesn't seem related. Hmm.\n\nAnother angle: Maybe the output is a 3x3 grid expanded into 6x6 by mirroring each row and column. For instance, each element is duplicated in a certain way. For example, each row is mirrored and the columns are mirrored as well. Let's see:\n\nTake input row 0 of Example 0: [8,5,0]. If mirrored horizontally, it becomes [0,5,8]. If we concatenate the original and mirrored, it would be [8,5,0,0,5,8]. But the first output row is [8,5,0,0,8,8]. So that's not exactly mirrored. The last three elements are 0,8,8. Not matching.\n\nLooking at Example 1's first output row: [3,8,2,8,3,3]. The first three are input row 0 [3,8,2], then the next three are [8,3,3]. Maybe the next three elements are the reverse of the first three but with some changes. The original is 3,8,2. Reverse is 2,8,3. But the next three are 8,3,3. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the next three elements are a combination of elements from adjacent rows. For example, the first row's next three elements could be elements from the second row. Let's check Example 0:\n\nFirst output row: [8,5,0,0,8,8]. The next three elements (0,8,8) may relate to the next row. The second input row is [8,5,3]. The third element is 3, but here we have 0,8,8. Not matching.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the next three elements are from the same column. For example, the fourth element in the first output row is 0, which is the third element of the first input row (0). The fifth element is 8, which is the first element of the first input row. The sixth element is 8 again. So maybe the pattern is [third element, first element, first element]. For input row 0 [8,5,0], third element 0, first 8. So 0,8,8. Which matches the first output row's last three elements.\n\nThen check the second input row [8,5,3]. Third element is 3. So the next three would be 3,8,8. But the second output row's last three are 3,5,5. Hmm, that's not matching. So maybe that's not the pattern.\n\nWait, in the second output row [8,5,3,3,5,5], the next three are 3,5,5. The third element of the input row is 3, then the second element is 5. So maybe 3,5,5. So third element, second element, second element. For input row [8,5,3], that would give 3,5,5. Which matches. Let's check the third input row of Example 0: [0,3,2]. The next three would be third element (2), second element (3), second element (3). So 2,3,3. But the third output row is [0,3,2,2,3,0]. The next three elements are 2,3,0. Hmm, doesn't fit. So maybe this pattern only applies to the first two rows?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the pattern for the next three elements is different per row. For example, the first two rows use third element, second, second, but the third row uses something else. That complicates things.\n\nAlternatively, let's look at the fourth row of Example 0's output: [0,3,2,2,3,0]. The next three elements here are 2,3,0. The third element of the input row is 2. Then maybe the elements are 2,3,0. Which is reverse of the input row [0,3,2] \u2192 reversed is [2,3,0]. So perhaps the next three elements are the reverse of the input row. Let's check:\n\nFirst input row [8,5,0]. Reverse is [0,5,8]. But the next three elements are 0,8,8. Doesn't match. Second input row [8,5,3] reversed is [3,5,8]. The next three elements are 3,5,5. Not matching. Third input row [0,3,2] reversed is [2,3,0]. Next three elements are 2,3,0. Which matches. So in the third row, the next three are reversed. But why only the third row?\n\nThis inconsistency makes it hard. Maybe there's another pattern.\n\nLooking at the entire output of Example 0:\n\nOriginal input rows:\n\nRow0: 8 5 0\n\nRow1:8 5 3\n\nRow2:0 3 2\n\nOutput rows:\n\nRow0:8 5 0 0 8 8\n\nRow1:8 5 3 3 5 5\n\nRow2:0 3 2 2 3 0\n\nRow3:0 3 2 2 3 0\n\nRow4:5 5 3 3 5 8\n\nRow5:8 8 0 0 5 8\n\nHmm. Let's see if the output is constructed by combining the original grid with its rotated or flipped version. For instance, the first three rows might be the original grid with some transformation, and the next three could be a rotated version.\n\nLooking at the last three rows:\n\nRow3:0 3 2 2 3 0 \u2192 same as row2.\n\nRow4:5 5 3 3 5 8\n\nRow5:8 8 0 0 5 8\n\nRow4 starts with 5,5,3. Maybe this is from the middle column of the input. Original input columns:\n\nCol0:8,8,0\n\nCol1:5,5,3\n\nCol2:0,3,2\n\nSo column 1 is [5,5,3]. If we look at row4:5,5,3,3,5,8. Maybe the first three elements are column1 reversed or something. [5,5,3] reversed is [3,5,5]. So row4 starts with 5,5,3. Not reversed. Then the next three elements are 3,5,8. Hmm, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe row4 is a combination of elements from different rows. For example, 5,5,3 could be elements from the second input row (8,5,3) and the first (8,5,0). Not sure.\n\nAnother approach: Let's look at the positions in the output and see if there's a pattern. For example, in Example 0's output:\n\nRow0: [8,5,0,0,8,8]\n\nPositions 0-2: same as input row0.\n\nPositions 3-5: 0,8,8.\n\nRow1: [8,5,3,3,5,5]\n\nPositions 0-2: input row1.\n\nPositions3-5:3,5,5.\n\nRow2: [0,3,2,2,3,0]\n\nPositions0-2: input row2.\n\nPositions3-5:2,3,0.\n\nRow3: same as row2.\n\nRow4: [5,5,3,3,5,8]\n\nPositions0-2:5,5,3.\n\nPositions3-5:3,5,8.\n\nRow5: [8,8,0,0,5,8]\n\nPositions0-2:8,8,0.\n\nPositions3-5:0,5,8.\n\nHmm. The first three rows of the output seem to be the original three input rows, each followed by some transformation. The next three rows are different.\n\nLooking at row3: same as row2. So perhaps row2 is duplicated. Then row4 and row5 are transformations of other parts.\n\nLooking at the positions3-5 of row0:0,8,8. These could be the third element of row0, then the first element of row0 twice. 0 (third), then 8 (first), 8 (first).\n\nSimilarly, row1's positions3-5:3 (third of row1), 5 (second of row1),5 (second again).\n\nRow2's positions3-5:2 (third of row2),3 (second of row2),0 (first of row2).\n\nSo for each of the first three output rows, positions3-5 are [third element of input row, second element, first element] but modified. Let's check:\n\nRow0: third element is 0, second is5, first is8. But the output's positions3-5 are 0,8,8. So third, first, first.\n\nRow1: third element is3, first is8. So positions3-5 would be3, first, first? But output is3,5,5. So third, second, second.\n\nRow2: third element is2, output positions3-5 are2,3,0. Which is third, second, first. So here it's third, second, first.\n\nThis inconsistency suggests that the pattern varies per row. Maybe for the first two rows, positions3-5 are [third, first, first] and [third, second, second], but for the third row, it's [third, second, first]. That's possible but seems arbitrary. Maybe there's a different logic.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps positions3-5 are the elements from the same column but from the row below. For example, in row0, positions3-5 could be the elements from row1's first column. Let's see:\n\nRow0's positions3-5:0,8,8. Row1's first column is8 (from input row1). But how does that fit? Not sure.\n\nAnother idea: The output is arranged in a way that combines the original grid and its rotations. For example, the first three rows are original rows followed by their rotated versions, and the next three rows are rotated versions of the original.\n\nAlternatively, the output is a 3x3 grid mirrored on both axes. So each original cell is in a 2x2 block. Let's see. For a 3x3 input, if each cell is expanded into a 2x2 block in the output, then the output would be 6x6. How?\n\nOriginal cell at (i,j) becomes four cells in the output at positions (2i, 2j), (2i, 2j+1), (2i+1, 2j), (2i+1, 2j+1). But how would that work?\n\nLooking at Example 0's input cell (0,0) is 8. In the output, cells (0,0), (0,1), (1,0), (1,1) would be 8. But the first row of the output is [8,5,0,0,8,8]. The first two elements are 8 and 5, which are from the original first row. This doesn't fit the 2x2 block idea.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each row is duplicated and modified. For example, the first three output rows are the original rows with some added elements, and the next three are mirrored or transformed versions.\n\nLooking at Example 0's output, rows 0-2 are the original rows with added elements, rows3-5 seem to be transformations of rows2,1,0. For instance:\n\nRow3 is same as row2.\n\nRow4: [5,5,3,3,5,8]. These elements could be from the middle column (5,5,3) and some other elements.\n\nRow5: [8,8,0,0,5,8]. The first three elements are 8,8,0, which could be from the first column (8,8,0) and then 0,5,8 from the third column (0,3,2) perhaps.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Maybe another approach: look for a pattern in how the output numbers are derived from the input numbers.\n\nFor Example 0:\n\nOriginal input:\n\nRow0:8,5,0\n\nRow1:8,5,3\n\nRow2:0,3,2\n\nOutput row0:8,5,0,0,8,8. The last three elements are 0,8,8. 0 is the third element of row0, 8 is the first element of row0, and another 8. So third, first, first.\n\nOutput row1:8,5,3,3,5,5. Third element of row1 is3, then5 (second element of row1), another5. So third, second, second.\n\nOutput row2:0,3,2,2,3,0. Third element is2, then3 (second element), then0 (first element). So third, second, first.\n\nThis pattern seems to vary per row. Row0: third, first, first. Row1: third, second, second. Row2: third, second, first. Then row3 is the same as row2. Row4 and row5 are more complex.\n\nMaybe the pattern for the last three elements of each row depends on the row's position. For the first row (row0), it's third, first, first. For row1, third, second, second. For row2, third, second, first. Then rows3-5 are generated based on other rows.\n\nBut then how to generate rows3-5?\n\nLooking at Example 0's row3: [0,3,2,2,3,0]. This is the same as row2's output. So maybe after the first three rows, the next three are generated from the same input rows but in reverse order, with their own patterns.\n\nRow4: [5,5,3,3,5,8]. The first three elements 5,5,3 are from the middle column of the input (5,5,3). Then next three are3,5,8. The 3 is from row2's third element (2?), maybe not. Alternatively, this could be the third column's elements in reverse: original third column is 0,3,2 \u2192 reversed is 2,3,0. But not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe row4 is generated from input row1, but transformed. Input row1 is [8,5,3]. If we take the third element (3), second (5), first (8), and append something. But row4 starts with5,5,3. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the output is a combination of the original grid and its rotations. For example, the output could be the original grid followed by a 180-degree rotation. Let's see:\n\nOriginal grid:\n\n8 5 0\n\n8 5 3\n\n0 3 2\n\n180-degree rotation would be:\n\n2 3 0\n\n3 5 8\n\n0 5 8\n\nBut the output rows after the first three don't exactly match this. However, Example 0's row5 is [8,8,0,0,5,8], which has elements similar to the first row of the rotated grid (8,5,0), but not exactly.\n\nAnother approach: Let's see if the output is the original grid concatenated with a modified version of the grid, either mirrored or transformed.\n\nThe first three elements of each output row match the input rows. The next three elements are a transformed version of the same or other rows.\n\nLooking at Example 0's row0: first three are [8,5,0], next three are [0,8,8]. Maybe the next three are the same row reversed but with some replacement. Original row0 reversed is [0,5,8], but the next three are [0,8,8]. So 0 is same, then 8 instead of 5, and another 8. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the next three elements are the third element, then the first element of the same row, then the first element again. That would fit row0: third (0), first (8), first (8) \u2192 0,8,8. Row1: third (3), first (8) \u2192 but the next three elements are3,5,5. So that doesn't fit. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, for the first three rows of the output, the next three elements are:\n\nFor row0: third, first, first.\n\nFor row1: third, second, second.\n\nFor row2: third, second, first.\n\nThen for the next three rows (rows3-5), maybe it's applying the same pattern to the columns or a different part.\n\nBut this seems inconsistent. Maybe there's a different pattern.\n\nLooking at Example 1:\n\nInput:\n\n[3,8,2]\n\n[3,2,2]\n\n[8,5,2]\n\nOutput:\n\nRow0:3,8,2,8,3,3 \u2192 first three elements are input row0. Next three:8,3,3. Which could be third element of row0 (2), but here it's 8. Not matching. Alternatively, the next three elements are from the next row. For example, input row1's first element is3. So 3, but no. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, the next three elements could be the elements from the same column. For example, row0's next three elements are8 (from column1 row0?), 3 (column0 row0), 3. Not sure.\n\nThis is getting too time-consuming. Maybe I should try to find a pattern that fits all examples.\n\nAnother observation: In each example, the output is twice the size of the input in both dimensions. So input is 3x3, output is 6x6. So perhaps each input element is mapped to a 2x2 block in the output. For example, the input element at (i,j) becomes a 2x2 block in the output at (2i,2j), (2i,2j+1), (2i+1,2j), (2i+1,2j+1). So each cell in the input is expanded into four cells in the output. But how?\n\nLet's test this with Example 0.\n\nInput cell (0,0) is 8. So output cells (0,0), (0,1), (1,0), (1,1) should be 8. But looking at Example 0's output:\n\nRow0: [8,5,0,0,8,8]\n\nRow1: [8,5,3,3,5,5]\n\nSo cells (0,0) and (0,1) are 8 and5. If the input cell (0,0) is 8, then the 2x2 block would be 8,5 (from row0) and 8,5 (from row1). But that's not four 8s. So this theory is incorrect.\n\nAnother idea: The output is constructed by concatenating the original matrix with a transformed version. For example, horizontally and vertically.\n\nAlternatively, the output is built by placing the original matrix in the top-left and bottom-right quadrants, and transformed versions in the other quadrants.\n\nBut how to determine the transformations.\n\nAlternatively, the output is the original matrix and its rotations. For example, the first three rows are original, the next three are rotated 180 degrees.\n\nBut in Example 0's output, rows3-5 don't match this.\n\nAlternative approach: Let's look at the positions in the output matrix. Each row in the output has six elements. The input has three elements per row. Maybe the output rows are formed by combining two input rows in some way.\n\nFor example, output row0 is input row0 followed by transformed row0.\n\nBut in Example 0's output, row0 is [8,5,0,0,8,8]. The first three are row0, then [0,8,8]. Not sure.\n\nAnother pattern: For each input row, create two output rows. For example, input row0 becomes output row0 and row3. Let's check Example 0:\n\nInput row0: [8,5,0]\n\nOutput row0: [8,5,0,0,8,8]\n\nOutput row3: [0,3,2,2,3,0]\n\nNo, row3 is from input row2.\n\nThis isn't helpful.\n\nAnother observation: In Example 0's output, row4 is [5,5,3,3,5,8], which has elements from input row1 (5,3) and row0 (8). Maybe row4 is combining elements from different input rows.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is constructed by rotating the input matrix and concatenating. For example, the first three rows are original, and the next three are rotated clockwise 90 degrees. But this would change the order of elements.\n\nAlternatively, the output is a combination of the original matrix and its transpose. The transpose of the input matrix would swap rows and columns. For Example 0, the transpose would be:\n\n[8,8,0]\n\n[5,5,3]\n\n[0,3,2]\n\nBut the output rows don't match this.\n\nHmm. This is challenging. Let's try to look for another pattern.\n\nLooking at the last three elements of each output row in Example 0:\n\nRow0:0,8,8 \u2192 sum is 16.\n\nRow1:3,5,5 \u2192 sum 13.\n\nRow2:2,3,0 \u2192 sum 5.\n\nRow3:2,3,0 \u2192 sum5.\n\nRow4:3,5,8 \u2192 sum16.\n\nRow5:0,5,8 \u2192 sum13.\n\nNot sure if sums matter.\n\nAnother angle: Let's see the relationship between the input and output elements. For example, in Example 0's output row0, the last three elements are0,8,8. These are the same as the first input row's third element (0), first element (8), and first element (8). So third, first, first.\n\nRow1's last three elements are3,5,5: third element of row1 (3), second element (5), second element (5).\n\nRow2's last three are2,3,0: third element (2), second (3), first (0).\n\nRow3 same as row2.\n\nRow4's last three are3,5,8: third element of row2 (2) not matching. Maybe third element of row1 (3), then second of row1 (5), then first of row0 (8). Hmm, 3,5,8.\n\nRow5's last three are0,5,8: first element of row0 (8), but the elements are0,5,8. Could be third element of row0 (0), second of row1 (5), first of row0 (8). 0,5,8.\n\nThis seems plausible. So for the first three rows, the last three elements are derived from the same row. For rows4 and5, they are derived from combining elements from different rows.\n\nBut how to generalize this?\n\nAlternatively, the pattern is:\n\nFor each input row i:\n\n- The first three elements of the output row i are the same as input row i.\n\n- The next three elements are formed as follows:\n\n   - For output rows 0 and 3: third element of input row i, first element of input row i, first element of input row i.\n\n   - For output rows 1 and 4: third element of input row i, second element of input row i, second element of input row i.\n\n   - For output rows 2 and5: third element of input row i, second element of input row i, first element of input row i.\n\nBut in Example 0:\n\nOutput row0: third (0), first (8), first (8) \u2192 matches.\n\nOutput row1: third (3), second (5), second (5) \u2192 matches.\n\nOutput row2: third (2), second (3), first (0) \u2192 matches.\n\nThen rows3-5 would be applying the same pattern to the same input rows again. But row3 is same as row2. So perhaps the pattern is that rows3-5 are duplicates of rows0-2 but with different transformations.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is divided into four quadrants:\n\nTop-left quadrant is the original matrix.\n\nTop-right is transformed.\n\nBottom-left is transformed.\n\nBottom-right is transformed.\n\nBut the output is 6x6, so each quadrant would be 3x3.\n\nIn Example 0:\n\nTop-left quadrant is the original input.\n\nTop-right would be rows0-2, columns3-5.\n\nBut in Example 0's top-right quadrant:\n\nRow0 columns3-5:0,8,8.\n\nRow1:3,5,5.\n\nRow2:2,3,0.\n\nNot sure what transformation this is.\n\nBottom-left quadrant (rows3-5, columns0-2):\n\nRow3:0,3,2.\n\nRow4:5,5,3.\n\nRow5:8,8,0.\n\nWhich seems to be the original rows in reverse order. Row3 is input row2, row4 is input row1's middle elements, row5 is input row0's first element duplicated.\n\nBottom-right quadrant (rows3-5, columns3-5):\n\nRow3:2,3,0.\n\nRow4:3,5,8.\n\nRow5:0,5,8.\n\nNot sure.\n\nAnother idea: The output is generated by rotating the input matrix clockwise and counter-clockwise and combining them. For example:\n\nOriginal matrix:\n\nA B C\n\nD E F\n\nG H I\n\nRotated 90 degrees clockwise:\n\nG D A\n\nH E B\n\nI F C\n\nThen combining original and rotated matrices. But this doesn't directly explain the output.\n\nAlternatively, the output is a combination of the original matrix and its mirror images. For example, original, then mirrored horizontally, vertically, and both.\n\nBut how to fit this into a 6x6 matrix.\n\nAlternatively, the output is a combination of the input matrix and its elements in reverse order. For example, each row is followed by its reverse. But in Example 0's first output row, the row is [8,5,0,0,8,8], which is original followed by [0,8,8], not the reverse.\n\nThis is getting frustrating. Let's try to find another angle.\n\nLooking at the output rows, maybe each output row is a combination of two input rows. For example, the first three elements from one input row and the next three from another, transformed.\n\nIn Example 0's output row4:5,5,3,3,5,8. The first three elements (5,5,3) could be from the middle column of the input (5,5,3). Then the next three (3,5,8) could be from other columns. Maybe the middle column followed by the third column's elements. Third column of input is 0,3,2. Reversed gives 2,3,0. Not matching.\n\nAlternatively, row4 is [5,5,3,3,5,8]. The first three elements are the middle column (5,5,3). The next three could be the third column of input (0,3,2) reversed and adjusted: 2,3,0 \u2192 perhaps adding something. Not sure.\n\nAnother idea: Maybe the output is created by taking each element and appending elements from the same position in other rows.\n\nFor example, output row0's first three are input row0. The next three could be row0's elements but modified. For example, 0 (from row0's third element), then 8 (row0's first), 8 (row0's first again). So it's like third, first, first.\n\nSimilarly, row1's next three are third (3), second (5), second (5).\n\nRow2's next three are third (2), second (3), first (0).\n\nThen, rows3-5 are generated using similar patterns but from different rows.\n\nFor example, row3 is row2's pattern again.\n\nRow4 could be applying the same pattern to row1.\n\nBut how does that fit?\n\nAlternatively, the output is structured such that each of the first three output rows is the input row followed by a transformation based on that row's elements, and the next three output rows are transformations based on the input columns or other combinations.\n\nBut I'm not making progress. Let's try to look for a pattern in the numbers.\n\nIn Example 0's output row0, after the original row, we have 0,8,8. These could be the third element of row0, then the first element twice.\n\nRow1 has 3,5,5: third, second, second.\n\nRow2 has 2,3,0: third, second, first.\n\nIf we follow this pattern for each row:\n\n- For row0: third, first, first.\n\n- For row1: third, second, second.\n\n- For row2: third, second, first.\n\nThen for the test input's rows, we can apply this pattern.\n\nTest input:\n\nRow0: [2,5,0]\n\nRow1: [2,5,1]\n\nRow2: [3,1,1]\n\nApplying the pattern:\n\nOutput row0: [2,5,0, 0,2,2]\n\nOutput row1: [2,5,1,1,5,5]\n\nOutput row2: [3,1,1,1,1,3]\n\nThen, what about the next three rows (rows3-5)?\n\nLooking at the examples, rows3-5 seem to repeat some of the patterns. For instance, in Example0, row3 is same as row2. Then row4 and row5 are different. Maybe the next three rows are generated based on the same pattern applied to reversed rows or columns.\n\nAlternatively, rows3-5 could be generated by taking the third, second, first elements of the input rows in reverse order.\n\nBut this is getting too vague. Given the time I've spent, perhaps I should proceed with the pattern for the first three rows and see if the rest can be derived similarly.\n\nSo for the test input:\n\nTest input rows:\n\n0: [2,5,0]\n\n1: [2,5,1]\n\n2: [3,1,1]\n\nApplying the pattern:\n\nOutput row0: [2,5,0, 0,2,2] (third:0, first:2, first:2)\n\nOutput row1: [2,5,1, 1,5,5] (third:1, second:5, second:5)\n\nOutput row2: [3,1,1, 1,1,3] (third:1, second:1, first:3)\n\nThen rows3-5: Need to find a pattern. Looking at Example0, rows3-5 are:\n\nrow3: [0,3,2,2,3,0] (same as row2)\n\nrow4: [5,5,3,3,5,8] \n\nrow5: [8,8,0,0,5,8]\n\nIn Example0's row3, it's the same as row2's output. Maybe row3 is a copy of row2's output. Then row4 and row5 are derived from other input rows.\n\nAlternatively, rows3-5 are generated by taking the third input row, second input row, and first input row in reverse order, applying the same pattern.\n\nBut in Example0's row3, it's the same as row2's output. So for test input, row3 could be the same as row2's output.\n\nThen row4 and row5 need to be generated. Looking at Example0's row4: [5,5,3,3,5,8]. The first three elements are5,5,3, which are the second input row's elements: input row1 is [8,5,3]. But 5,5,3 isn't the same. Wait, the middle column of the input is [5,5,3], which matches row4's first three elements. So maybe row4 is the middle column followed by some transformation.\n\nThen the next three elements in row4 are3,5,8. These could be third element of the middle column (3), second element (5), first element (5) \u2192 but no. Or perhaps the third column's elements. Third column of input is0,3,2. Reversed is2,3,0. Not matching.\n\nAlternatively, row4's first three elements are the middle column of the input (5,5,3), and the next three are the third column's elements (0,3,2) transformed. For Example0, row4's next three elements are3,5,8. The third column is0,3,2. So 0 \u2192 3, 3 \u21925, 2\u21928. Not obvious.\n\nAlternatively, row4's next three elements are the third element of row1 (3), second element of row0 (5), first element of row0 (8). So3,5,8. Which matches Example0's row4's next three elements.\n\nSimilarly, row5's next three elements are0,5,8. Which could be third element of row0 (0), second element of row1 (5), first element of row0 (8).\n\nIf this is the pattern:\n\nFor row4:\n\nFirst three elements are the middle column of the input (5,5,3).\n\nNext three elements are third element of row1 (3), second element of row0 (5), first element of row0 (8).\n\nFor Example0's row4, that gives3,5,8.\n\nFor the test input, middle column is [5,5,1].\n\nSo first three elements of row4 would be5,5,1.\n\nNext three elements would be third element of row1 (1), second element of row0 (5), first element of row0 (2). So1,5,2.\n\nThus, row4 would be [5,5,1,1,5,2].\n\nRow5's first three elements would be the first column of the input. For Example0's row5, first column is8,8,0 \u2192 but row5's first three elements are8,8,0. Which matches.\n\nThen next three elements would be third element of row0 (0), second element of row1 (5), first element of row0 (8), giving0,5,8.\n\nFor the test input, first column is2,2,3.\n\nSo row5's first three elements would be2,2,3.\n\nNext three elements would be third element of row0 (0), second element of row1 (5), first element of row0 (2) \u21920,5,2.\n\nThus, row5 would be [2,2,3,0,5,2].\n\nPutting it all together for the test input:\n\nRow0: [2,5,0,0,2,2]\n\nRow1: [2,5,1,1,5,5]\n\nRow2: [3,1,1,1,1,3]\n\nRow3: [3,1,1,1,1,3] (same as row2)\n\nRow4: [5,5,1,1,5,2]\n\nRow5: [2,2,3,0,5,2]\n\nLet's check if this aligns with the examples.\n\nIn Example0's row4, first three are5,5,3 (middle column), then3,5,8. Which is third element of row1 (3), second of row0 (5), first of row0 (8). So yes.\n\nIn Example1's row4: [8,2,5,2,2,3]. First three elements8,2,5 are middle column of input (8,2,5). Then next three elements2,2,3. Third element of row1 (2), second of row0 (8's second element is8's row0's second element is8?), wait input for Example1 is:\n\nInput row0:3,8,2\n\nrow1:3,2,2\n\nrow2:8,5,2\n\nMiddle column is8,2,5. So row4's first three are8,2,5. Next three elements are third element of row1 (2), second of row0 (8), first of row0 (3). So 2,8,3. But Example1's row4 is [8,2,5,2,2,3]. The next three elements are2,2,3. Hmm, which doesn't match. So this pattern may not hold.\n\nTherefore, this approach might be incorrect.\n\nGiven the time I've invested and the complexity, perhaps the best approach is to apply the observed pattern to the first three rows and duplicate row2 for row3, then for rows4 and5, use the middle column and first column respectively with the same transformation pattern.\n\nBut I'm not confident. However, given the time, I'll proceed with this and see.\n\nFinal answer for the test input:\n\n[2,5,0,0,2,2]\n\n[2,5,1,1,5,5]\n\n[3,1,1,1,1,3]\n\n[3,1,1,1,1,3]\n\n[5,5,1,1,5,2]\n\n[2,2,3,0,5,2]",

        "cot_2": "Okay, let's tackle this puzzle. The task is to figure out the pattern from the training examples and apply it to the test input. Let's start by looking at the examples carefully.\n\nStarting with Example 0:\n\nInput is three rows:\n[8,5,0]\n[8,5,3]\n[0,3,2]\n\nThe output is six rows. So each input row is transformed into two output rows, maybe? Let's check.\n\nLooking at the first input row [8,5,0], the first output row is [8,5,0,0,8,8]. Hmm, the original elements followed by 0,8,8. Wait, where do those numbers come from? Let's see. The next output row is [8,5,3,3,5,5], which seems to relate to the second input row [8,5,3]. Then the third output row is [0,3,2,2,3,0], which is the third input row followed by 2,3,0. Then the fourth output row is the same as the third. The fifth and sixth rows are [5,5,3,3,5,8] and [8,8,0,0,5,8]. \n\nWait, maybe the output is a 3x3 grid transformed into a 6x6 grid by mirroring or some reflection. Let me check the structure. The output has six rows, each with six elements. So perhaps each input row is being expanded into two rows, and each element into two elements. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is created by taking each row from the input, reversing it, appending some values, and then arranging them in a certain way. Let's look for patterns in the numbers.\n\nLooking at Example 0's output rows:\n\nFirst output row: [8,5,0,0,8,8] \u2013 the first three elements are the input row. The next three are 0,8,8. Where do these come from? The original row is [8,5,0]. The fourth element is 0, which is the last element of the input row. The fifth is 8, the first element of the input row. The sixth is 8 again. Hmm, maybe the last three elements are the reverse of the input row, but not exactly. Wait, [8,5,0] reversed is [0,5,8]. But the fourth to sixth elements are 0,8,8. Not matching. Let me check another example.\n\nIn Example 1:\n\nInput rows are:\n[3,8,2]\n[3,2,2]\n[8,5,2]\n\nFirst output row: [3,8,2,8,3,3]. The original row is [3,8,2]. The added elements are 8,3,3. Hmm. Let's see, maybe the added elements are related to other rows. The second input row is [3,2,2], and the second output row is [3,2,2,5,2,8]. The 5 comes from the third row's middle element (8,5,2). The 8 is from the third element of the third row? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output rows are constructed by combining the original row with some rotated or transformed version of the input matrix.\n\nWait, looking at the entire output structure for Example 0:\n\nThe output has six rows. Let's imagine that the input is a 3x3 matrix, and the output is a 6x6 matrix. So each element in the input is transformed into a 2x2 block in the output. That's a common pattern in some matrix transformations.\n\nFor example, if the input is a 3x3 matrix, each element becomes a 2x2 block, leading to a 6x6 matrix. Let's check if this holds.\n\nTake the first input row of Example 0: [8,5,0]. If each element is replaced by a 2x2 block, then the first row of the output would have blocks from 8, then 5, then 0. Let's see:\n\nFirst output row is [8,5,0,0,8,8]. Breaking this into three 2-element parts: 8,5; 0,0; 8,8. Wait, that doesn't seem to fit. Alternatively, maybe each element is duplicated, but with some transformation.\n\nAlternatively, the output matrix is constructed by mirroring the input matrix in some way. For example, creating a larger matrix by reflecting the original. Let's look at the positions.\n\nIn Example 0's output:\n\nRow 0: [8,5,0,0,8,8]\n\nRow 1: [8,5,3,3,5,5]\n\nRow 2: [0,3,2,2,3,0]\n\nRow 3: [0,3,2,2,3,0] (same as row 2)\n\nRow 4: [5,5,3,3,5,8]\n\nRow 5: [8,8,0,0,5,8]\n\nHmm. The first three rows might be the original matrix with some transformation, and the last three rows are a mirror or rotation. Alternatively, the output could be the original matrix concatenated with a rotated version.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the output as a 6x6 matrix, perhaps it's constructed by combining the original matrix and its rotations. For example, the top-left 3x3 is the original, then the top-right is a rotated version, etc. But I need to check.\n\nAlternatively, let's think of the output as a 3x3 grid of 2x2 blocks. Each original element is converted into a 2x2 block. For example, each input element [a, b, c] becomes a 2x2 block. Let's see.\n\nTake the first input row of Example 0: 8,5,0. If each element is a 2x2 block, then the first row of the output would be 8's block, then 5's block, then 0's block. Each block's elements would be determined by some rule.\n\nLooking at the first output row: [8,5,0,0,8,8]. Maybe each original element is expanded into two elements. Wait, the first three elements are 8,5,0. Then the next three are 0,8,8. So perhaps each original element is followed by another element, and this is done for each row, then mirrored in some way.\n\nAlternatively, let's look for how each element in the output is derived from the input. Let's take the first output row of Example 0: [8,5,0,0,8,8]. The first three elements are the original input row. The fourth element is 0, which is the third element of the input row. Then 8, which is the first element, then 8 again. So the fourth to sixth elements are [0,8,8]. Similarly, the second output row is [8,5,3,3,5,5]. The first three are the second input row [8,5,3], and the next three are [3,5,5]. The third element of the row is 3, then the second element 5, then 5 again.\n\nLooking at the third output row [0,3,2,2,3,0], which corresponds to the third input row [0,3,2]. The next three elements are [2,3,0]. That's the reverse of the input row. Then the fourth output row is the same as the third. Then the fifth row is [5,5,3,3,5,8]. The first three elements are 5,5,3. Then 3,5,8. Not sure. The sixth row is [8,8,0,0,5,8], which seems similar to the first row but mirrored.\n\nWait, maybe each input row is followed by a reversed version or some modified version. But how does this extend to the entire output?\n\nAlternatively, let's look at the output as a combination of the original matrix and its transpose, or some rotated versions. For example, the output could be a combination of the original matrix and its rotations arranged in a certain pattern.\n\nAnother approach: look for the positions in the output and see where they come from in the input. For example, in Example 0's output:\n\nRow 0, column 0: 8 (original input row 0, column 0)\nRow 0, column 1: 5 (original row 0, column 1)\nRow 0, column 2: 0 (original row 0, column 2)\nThen columns 3,4,5: 0,8,8. Maybe these are from other parts. Let's see:\n\nOriginal matrix:\nRow 0: 8,5,0\nRow 1: 8,5,3\nRow 2: 0,3,2\n\nLooking at row 0's columns 3,4,5: 0,8,8. The 0 is from row 0, column 2. The 8 could be from row 0, column 0 (8), and then another 8. Maybe it's mirroring the row. So the first three elements are the original row, then the next three are the reverse of the row, but with some duplication. Wait, original row 0 is [8,5,0], reversed is [0,5,8], but the next three elements are 0,8,8. Not matching. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the next three elements are the same as the original row but with some transformation. For example, in row 0: 8,5,0 followed by 0,8,8. The 0 is the third element, then 8 (first element), then 8 again. So perhaps the pattern is [third element, first element, first element].\n\nTesting this:\n\nOriginal row 0: [8,5,0] \u2192 third element is 0, first is 8. So [0,8,8]. Which matches the fourth to sixth elements.\n\nRow 1: [8,5,3] \u2192 third element 3, first 8. So [3,8,8], but the output has [3,5,5]. Wait, that doesn't fit. So maybe that's not the pattern.\n\nWait, let's check row 1 of Example 0's output: [8,5,3,3,5,5]. The added elements are 3,5,5. The original row is [8,5,3]. The third element is 3. Then maybe next elements are third, second, second? 3,5,5. Yes, because the third element is 3, the second is 5, then another 5. So for each input row, the next three elements are [third element, second element, second element]. Let's check:\n\nRow 0 input: [8,5,0] \u2192 third is 0, second is 5. So [0,5,5]. But the output has 0,8,8. Doesn't fit.\n\nHmm, not matching.\n\nAnother angle: Looking at the entire output matrix structure. For example, in Example 0, the output is six rows. The first three rows might be the original rows each extended with some elements, and the last three rows are another part. Alternatively, maybe the output is a combination of the original matrix and its mirror images.\n\nWait, looking at Example 0's output rows 0-2 and 3-5. Rows 2 and 3 are the same. Then rows 4 and 5 are different. Let's see:\n\nOriginal input rows:\n\nRow0:8,5,0\nRow1:8,5,3\nRow2:0,3,2\n\nOutput rows:\n\nRow0:8,5,0,0,8,8\nRow1:8,5,3,3,5,5\nRow2:0,3,2,2,3,0\nRow3:0,3,2,2,3,0 (same as row2)\nRow4:5,5,3,3,5,8\nRow5:8,8,0,0,5,8\n\nLooking at rows 4 and 5: [5,5,3,3,5,8] and [8,8,0,0,5,8]. These look like reversed or transformed versions of the original rows. For example, row4 starts with 5,5,3 which might be related to row1's elements. Maybe it's a rotation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is constructed by appending the original matrix with its rotations. For example, the first three rows are the original rows each with some appended elements, and the last three are the reverse or a rotation.\n\nAlternatively, considering the output as a 6x6 matrix, maybe each quadrant is a transformed version of the input matrix. For example:\n\nTop-left 3x3: original matrix\nTop-right: original rotated 180 degrees\nBottom-left: flipped vertically\nBottom-right: something else.\n\nBut I need to check.\n\nAnother approach: Look at individual elements and see if there's a pattern in how they are generated.\n\nTake Example 0's first output row: [8,5,0,0,8,8]\n\nOriginal elements are 8,5,0. The next three elements are 0,8,8. 0 is the third element of the input row. 8 is the first element, then another 8. So maybe the pattern is third element, first element, first element. Let's see if this holds for other rows.\n\nSecond input row in Example0 is [8,5,3], output row1: [8,5,3,3,5,5]. Next three elements:3,5,5. Third element is 3, then the second element 5, then another 5. So that's third, second, second.\n\nThird input row [0,3,2], output row2: [0,3,2,2,3,0]. Next three elements:2,3,0. Which is the reverse of the original row.\n\nHmm, inconsistency here. So perhaps the pattern varies per row? That seems unlikely. Maybe there's a different logic.\n\nLooking at Example1:\n\nInput rows:\n[3,8,2]\n[3,2,2]\n[8,5,2]\n\nFirst output row: [3,8,2,8,3,3]. Next three elements:8,3,3. The third element of the input row is 2, but the next three elements here are 8,3,3. That doesn't fit the previous idea.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the next three elements are taken from another part of the matrix. For example, in Example0's first row's next three elements (0,8,8): 0 is the element below in the original matrix (row2, column2?), maybe not. Let's see:\n\nOriginal matrix for Example0:\n\nRow0:8,5,0\nRow1:8,5,3\nRow2:0,3,2\n\nIn output row0, after the original elements, we have 0,8,8. The 0 is the last element of row0. The 8 could be the first element of row0, then another 8. Maybe the pattern is [last element of current row, first element of current row, first element again]. So for row0: 0,8,8. That fits. For row1: last element is 3, first is 8 \u2192 3,8,8. But in the output row1, the next three are 3,5,5. So that doesn't fit. So that's not the pattern.\n\nAlternative approach: Let's see if the output rows correspond to a combination of the original rows and their transformations. For example, each original row is followed by a modified version, and this is repeated for columns.\n\nWait, considering the output rows as pairs. For example, in Example0:\n\nRow0: [8,5,0,0,8,8]\n\nRow1: [8,5,3,3,5,5]\n\nRow2: [0,3,2,2,3,0]\n\nRow3: same as row2\n\nRow4: [5,5,3,3,5,8]\n\nRow5: [8,8,0,0,5,8]\n\nNotice that row4 and row5 might be transformations of the original rows. For example, row4 starts with 5,5,3, which is similar to row1's elements (8,5,3) but transformed. Maybe it's a rotated or flipped version.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is constructed by arranging the original matrix and its transformations in a certain way, like rotating 180 degrees and appending.\n\nAnother idea: Each row in the output is a combination of two rows from the input. For example, the first half and second half of the output row come from different input rows. Let's check.\n\nTake Example0's first output row: [8,5,0,0,8,8]. The first three elements are row0 of input, the next three could be elements from row2. Row2's first element is 0, then 3, 2. But the next three are 0,8,8. Not matching. So that's not directly.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each output row is the concatenation of two transformed input rows. For example, original row and reversed row. Let's see. Original row0: [8,5,0]. Reversed is [0,5,8]. But the output row0's next three elements are 0,8,8. Not matching.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is generated by mirroring the input matrix horizontally and vertically, creating a larger matrix. But how does that fit into 6x6?\n\nAlternatively, let's think about the output as a combination of the input matrix and its rotations. For example, the original matrix, then rotated clockwise, then rotated 180 degrees, etc. But I'm not sure.\n\nWait, let's look at the entire output of Example0. The output has 6 rows, each with 6 elements. Let's imagine the output is a 2x2 block of the original 3x3 matrix. For example, each element in the input is replaced by a 2x2 block, but the blocks are arranged such that the overall matrix is 6x6.\n\nFor example, the input element at (i,j) is transformed into a 2x2 block. Let's see:\n\nTake input element 8 at (0,0). In the output, the blocks would be:\n\nAt positions (0,0) and (0,1), (1,0), (1,1) based on some rule. But how?\n\nLooking at the first two rows of the output in Example0:\n\nRow0:8,5,0,0,8,8\n\nRow1:8,5,3,3,5,5\n\nIf we split each row into three parts of two elements each:\n\nRow0: [8,5], [0,0], [8,8]\n\nRow1: [8,5], [3,3], [5,5]\n\nThen, perhaps each input element is being transformed into a 2x2 block. For example:\n\nInput element 8 (0,0) becomes the block [8,5; 8,5]. Wait, but the first two elements of row0 are 8,5, and row1's first two are 8,5. So that's a 2x2 block. Then the next two elements for input (0,1) which is 5: [0,0] and [3,3]. Hmm, that's 0 and 3, which are from the third row of input. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, each input element is mapped to a 2x2 block that includes the element itself and elements from adjacent positions. For example, for element (i,j), the block includes (i,j), (i,j+1), (i+1,j), (i+1,j+1). But for a 3x3 input, this would create a 4x4 output. Not 6x6.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is created by tiling the input matrix in a certain way. For example, arranging the original matrix and its rotations in a 2x2 grid, leading to a 6x6 matrix. But that's unclear.\n\nAnother angle: Let's look for symmetry in the output. In Example0, the output rows 2 and 3 are the same. Rows 0 and 5 have some similarities. For example, row5 is [8,8,0,0,5,8], which ends with 5,8. Row0 starts with 8,5,0 and ends with 8,8. Maybe there's a reflection involved.\n\nAlternatively, the output is a combination of the original matrix and its transpose. The original matrix is 3x3, so transpose would be 3x3. But combining them would make 3x6, but the output is 6x6. Not sure.\n\nLet me try another approach. Looking at the positions in the output matrix, perhaps each element in the output is determined by a combination of the input elements. For example, output[i][j] is equal to input[i mod 3][j mod 3] rotated or transformed somehow. But need to check.\n\nFor example, in Example0's output row0: columns0-2 are the original row0. Columns3-5:0,8,8. Let's see:\n\ncolumns3:0 is input[0][2], columns4:8 is input[0][0], columns5:8 again input[0][0]. So for columns 3-5 in row0: [input[0][2], input[0][0], input[0][0]]\n\nSimilarly, row1's columns3-5:3 (input[1][2]),5 (input[1][1]),5 (input[1][1])\n\nRow2's columns3-5:2 (input[2][2]),3 (input[2][1]),0 (input[2][0])\n\nRow3 is the same as row2. So columns3-5 here are same as row2's columns3-5.\n\nRow4's columns0-2:5,5,3. These might correspond to input[1][1], input[1][1], input[1][2]. Then columns3-5:3,5,8. Input[1][2], input[1][1], input[0][0].\n\nRow5's columns0-2:8,8,0. Input[0][0], input[0][0], input[0][2]. Columns3-5:0,5,8. Input[0][2], input[1][1], input[0][0].\n\nThis seems complicated. Maybe there's a pattern where the output is built by mirroring or rotating the original matrix in certain ways and combining them.\n\nAnother observation: In Example0's output, the first three rows (0-2) are:\n\n[8,5,0,0,8,8]\n\n[8,5,3,3,5,5]\n\n[0,3,2,2,3,0]\n\nThe next three rows (3-5) are:\n\n[0,3,2,2,3,0] (same as row2)\n\n[5,5,3,3,5,8]\n\n[8,8,0,0,5,8]\n\nNoticing that row3 is the same as row2. Then row4 starts with 5,5,3. Perhaps this is the original row1 but transformed. Original row1: [8,5,3]. Transformed to [5,5,3]. How? Maybe reverse and take the last two elements? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is structured as follows:\n\nThe first three rows are the original rows each followed by a transformation, and the next three rows are the reverse of the original rows with transformations. For example:\n\nOriginal rows 0,1,2 \u2192 transformed rows 0,1,2.\n\nThen reversed rows 2,1,0 \u2192 transformed rows 3,4,5.\n\nBut in Example0, row3 is same as row2, which is original row2 transformed. Then row4 is [5,5,3,3,5,8]. Original row1 transformed again? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the output is constructed by taking the original matrix and concatenating it with its 180-degree rotation. For example, a 3x6 matrix where the first 3 columns are the original and the next 3 are the rotation. Then duplicate the rows to make 6x6. But this doesn't fit the examples.\n\nAnother observation: The output has six rows. Each original row generates two output rows. Let's see:\n\nExample0 has three input rows, and six output rows. So each input row generates two output rows. Let's check:\n\nOriginal row0: [8,5,0] \u2192 output row0 and row5?\n\nRow0: [8,5,0,0,8,8]\n\nRow5: [8,8,0,0,5,8]\n\nNot sure. Alternatively, each input row is transformed into two output rows. For example, row0 becomes row0 and row5, row1 becomes row1 and row4, row2 becomes row2 and row3.\n\nBut in Example0, row3 is same as row2, so maybe row2 and row3 are generated from input row2.\n\nHmm. Let's look at row4 in Example0: [5,5,3,3,5,8]. This could be related to input row1 [8,5,3]. The first three elements are 5,5,3. Which is input row1's elements but starting from the middle? Or reversed.\n\nInput row1:8,5,3 \u2192 reversed is 3,5,8. But row4's first three elements are 5,5,3. Not matching.\n\nAlternatively, row4 is a transformation of input row1, perhaps taking the second element twice and then the third.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is constructed by taking each input row and creating two rows: the original row followed by a modified version, and then doing the same for the columns.\n\nAlternatively, let's think of the output as a 3x3 grid where each cell is a 2x2 matrix. So each original element is replaced by a 2x2 block. This would make the output a 6x6 matrix. So how to determine each block?\n\nFor example, the original element at (i,j) becomes a 2x2 block. Let's check if this is the case.\n\nIn Example0, the original element at (0,0) is 8. The first two rows of the output start with 8,5 and 8,5. Wait, that's two rows, but not a 2x2 block of 8s. So maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, each 2x2 block is formed by the original element and elements from adjacent cells. For example, the block for (i,j) could include (i,j), (i,j+1), (i+1,j), (i+1,j+1). But this would require the input to have overlapping elements. For a 3x3 input, this would create a 2x2 blocks in 3x3 positions, leading to a 5x5 output, which doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, the output is formed by duplicating each row and column. For example, each row is duplicated, and each element is duplicated. So 3x3 becomes 6x6 by doubling each row and each element. But in Example0, row0 is [8,5,0], duplicated would be [8,8,5,5,0,0], but the output row0 is [8,5,0,0,8,8], which doesn't match.\n\nAnother thought: The output rows seem to have the first three elements as the input row, and the next three elements are a transformation. For example:\n\nExample0 row0: [8,5,0,0,8,8]\n\nHere, the first three are input row0. The next three: 0,8,8. Let's see what these numbers are. The 0 is the third element of the input row0, the 8 is the first element of row0, and another 8. So perhaps the pattern for the next three elements is [third element of current row, first element of current row, first element of current row].\n\nTesting this for Example0 row0: 0,8,8 \u2192 matches. For row1: third element is 3, first element is 8 \u2192 3,8,8. But in the output, row1's next three are 3,5,5. Doesn't match. So that's not consistent.\n\nExample1's first output row: [3,8,2,8,3,3]. First three are input row0:3,8,2. Next three:8,3,3. Third element is 2, but the next three are 8,3,3. So that doesn't fit the previous idea.\n\nAlternative idea: The next three elements are the reverse of the original row, but with some modification. For Example0 row0, original reversed is 0,5,8. The next three are 0,8,8. Not matching.\n\nHmm. This is getting complicated. Let's try to look for a different pattern. Let's see if the output can be divided into two parts, each being a transformed version of the input.\n\nFor instance, in Example0's output:\n\nThe first three rows (0-2) and the last three rows (3-5) may be two different transformations of the input matrix. Let's compare them.\n\nFirst three rows:\n\n[8,5,0,0,8,8]\n\n[8,5,3,3,5,5]\n\n[0,3,2,2,3,0]\n\nLast three rows:\n\n[0,3,2,2,3,0] (same as row2)\n\n[5,5,3,3,5,8]\n\n[8,8,0,0,5,8]\n\nNotice that the first three rows have the original rows followed by some elements, and the last three rows seem to be a mirror or rotation. For example, row5 ends with 5,8, which are the first two elements of the original row0. Maybe it's a rotated version.\n\nAnother observation: In Example0's output, the fourth row (row3) is the same as row2. The fifth row (row4) is [5,5,3,3,5,8]. The first three elements 5,5,3 could be the second row of the input ([8,5,3]) but modified. For example, 5,5,3 is the middle element 5, then 5 again, then 3. And the next three elements 3,5,8: 3 is the third element of the second input row, 5 is the second element, and 8 is the first element of the first input row.\n\nThis seems too ad-hoc. Maybe there's a systematic way to generate the output rows.\n\nLet's think about the output rows for each example as being the input matrix followed by its rotation or reflection. For example, the output could be the original matrix concatenated with its 180-degree rotation, then vertically stacked with the vertical reflection concatenated with another transformation.\n\nBut let's check Example0's input matrix:\n\nOriginal:\nRow0:8 5 0\n\nRow1:8 5 3\n\nRow2:0 3 2\n\nThe 180-degree rotation would be:\n\nRow0':2 3 0\n\nRow1':3 5 8\n\nRow2':0 5 8\n\nBut the output doesn't directly match this. Alternatively, the vertical flip (upside down) would be:\n\nRow0:0 3 2\n\nRow1:8 5 3\n\nRow2:8 5 0\n\nThen, concatenating horizontally, the original and the flipped version. But then each row would be original row followed by flipped row. For Example0, row0 would be [8,5,0,0,3,2], which doesn't match the output.\n\nAnother idea: The output is generated by taking each row of the input and its reverse, then appending elements from the next row. But this doesn't fit the examples.\n\nAlternatively, each output row is a combination of two input rows. For example, the first three elements are from one row, the next three from another. Let's check:\n\nExample0's output row0: [8,5,0,0,8,8]. First three from row0, next three: 0 (row0's third element), 8 (row0's first), 8 (row0's first). So maybe row0's own elements transformed.\n\nRow1's output: [8,5,3,3,5,5]. First three from row1, next three: 3 (row1's third),5 (row1's second),5 (row1's second).\n\nRow2's output: [0,3,2,2,3,0]. First three from row2, next three:2 (row2's third),3 (row2's second),0 (row2's first).\n\nRow3 is the same as row2.\n\nRow4: [5,5,3,3,5,8]. First three:5,5,3. Maybe from row1's elements: 5 is row1's second, 5 again, 3 is row1's third. Next three:3 (row1's third),5 (row1's second),8 (row0's first).\n\nRow5: [8,8,0,0,5,8]. First three:8,8,0. From row0's first element twice and row0's third. Next three:0 (row0's third),5 (row0's second),8 (row0's first).\n\nThis seems to be a pattern where each output row's second half is derived from the same or another row's elements. For example:\n\nRow0: first half is row0, second half is [row0[2], row0[0], row0[0]]\n\nRow1: first half is row1, second half is [row1[2], row1[1], row1[1]]\n\nRow2: first half is row2, second half is [row2[2], row2[1], row2[0]]\n\nRow3: same as row2.\n\nRow4: first half is [row1[1], row1[1], row1[2]], second half is [row1[2], row1[1], row0[0]]\n\nRow5: first half is [row0[0], row0[0], row0[2]], second half is [row0[2], row0[1], row0[0]]\n\nBut this seems too arbitrary. Is there a general rule here?\n\nLet me try to generalize:\n\nFor each row in the input, the output appends three elements which are derived from the same row or another row. The pattern varies for different rows.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is constructed by creating a larger matrix where each element from the input is placed in multiple positions according to some rule.\n\nAlternatively, let's think of the output as a 3x3 grid of 2x2 blocks. Each block corresponds to an input element. For example, the input element a becomes a 2x2 block determined by certain rules. Let's see if this works.\n\nFor Example0's input:\n\nOriginal matrix:\n8 5 0\n\n8 5 3\n\n0 3 2\n\nAssuming each element becomes a 2x2 block, then the output would be 6x6.\n\nFor example, the 8 at (0,0) becomes a block. Let's see what the block would be. Looking at the first two rows of the output:\n\nRow0:8,5,0,0,8,8\n\nRow1:8,5,3,3,5,5\n\nThe first two columns of rows0-1 are 8,5 in row0 and 8,5 in row1. So the block for (0,0) is:\n\n8 5\n\n8 5\n\nBut why? The element is 8. Maybe the block is [a, next element in row; same element, next element in column]. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, each block is filled with the element itself. So 8 becomes:\n\n8 8\n\n8 8\n\nBut that's not what's happening here. The first block seems to have 8 and 5.\n\nThis approach isn't working. Let me try to look for another pattern.\n\nLooking at the output rows, perhaps each row is the original row followed by the reverse of the same row but with some modification. For example, in Example0 row0: [8,5,0,0,8,8]. Original reversed is [0,5,8], but the appended elements are [0,8,8]. Not exactly reversed. But if we take the third element, then first element twice, it matches.\n\nSo, the pattern for the first three output rows could be: original row followed by [third element, first element, first element].\n\nLet's check:\n\nExample0 row0: third element 0 \u2192 appended [0,8,8]. Yes, matches.\n\nExample0 row1: third element 3 \u2192 appended [3,8,8]. But the output is [3,5,5]. Doesn't match. So this doesn't work.\n\nExample1 row0: third element 2 \u2192 appended [2,3,3]. But output is [8,3,3]. So no.\n\nAnother idea: The appended elements are derived from the diagonal of the matrix. For Example0 row0's appended elements 0,8,8: 0 is the third element of row0, 8 is the first element of row0, and 8 is the first element of row0. So perhaps it's [c, a, a], where a is the first element of the current row, c is the third.\n\nBut for row1 of Example0, a=8, c=3. So [3,8,8], but output is [3,5,5]. Doesn't fit.\n\nAlternative pattern: The appended elements are [c, b, b], where b is the second element of the row. For Example0 row0: c=0, b=5 \u2192 [0,5,5]. But output is [0,8,8]. No.\n\nAnother angle: Let's look for the relationship between the input rows and the output rows beyond the first three elements. For example, in Example0's row0, the appended elements are 0,8,8. These could be derived from other positions in the matrix. For example, 0 is the element (0,2), 8 is (0,0), and another 8. But why?\n\nAlternatively, each appended triplet is related to the same column in the input. For example, row0's appended elements are the third element of column0, first element of column0, etc. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the appended elements are taken from the diagonal elements of the input matrix. For Example0, the diagonal is 8,5,2. So appended elements could be 2,8,8. But row0's appended is 0,8,8. Doesn't fit.\n\nThis is getting frustrating. Let's try to think of the output as a combination of the input matrix and its mirror images.\n\nFor example, the output might be:\n\nOriginal matrix | Mirrored vertically\n\n-------------------------------------\n\nMirrored horizontally | Original matrix rotated 180 degrees\n\nBut let's check.\n\nOriginal matrix Example0:\n\n8 5 0\n\n8 5 3\n\n0 3 2\n\nMirrored vertically (flip columns):\n\n0 5 8\n\n3 5 8\n\n2 3 0\n\nMirrored horizontally (flip rows):\n\n0 3 2\n\n8 5 3\n\n8 5 0\n\nRotated 180 degrees:\n\n2 3 0\n\n3 5 8\n\n0 5 8\n\nBut combining these doesn't directly give the output. For example, the first three rows of the output include the original rows followed by mirrored versions. But the actual output has different elements.\n\nAnother approach: Let's consider that each output row is a combination of the input row and another row from the input. For example, row0's appended elements are from row2. Let's check.\n\nExample0 row0 appended elements:0,8,8. Row2 is [0,3,2]. The appended elements are 0 (row2[0]), 8 (row0[0]), 8 (row0[0]). Maybe it's taking the first element of row2, then twice the first element of row0.\n\nBut this seems arbitrary. However, in Example0 row1's appended elements are 3,5,5. Row1's own elements are [8,5,3]. The appended elements are 3 (row1[2]),5 (row1[1]),5 (row1[1]).\n\nRow2's appended elements are 2,3,0. Which are row2's elements in reverse order [2,3,0].\n\nRow3 is same as row2's appended elements.\n\nRow4's appended elements are 3,5,8. Which are row1's elements in reverse order [3,5,8], but the output row4's appended is 3,5,8. But the original row1 is [8,5,3], reversed is [3,5,8]. So that matches.\n\nRow5's appended elements are 0,5,8. Which is row0 reversed [0,5,8]. \n\nSo putting this together:\n\n- For the first three output rows, the appended elements are:\n\n   row0: [c, a, a] where c is the third element of row0, a is the first.\n\n   row1: [c, b, b] where c is third element of row1, b is second.\n\n   row2: [c, b, a] where a is first, b second, c third.\n\n- For the last three output rows:\n\n   row3: same as row2's appended.\n\n   row4: row1 reversed.\n\n   row5: row0 reversed.\n\nBut this seems inconsistent. For example, row4's first three elements are [5,5,3], which is row1's elements transformed: 5,5,3 (row1's second, second, third). And row5's first three are [8,8,0], which is row0's elements transformed: 8,8,0 (row0's first, first, third).\n\nThis is getting too complex. Maybe there's a different pattern.\n\nWait, let's look at the Test Input and see if we can find a pattern by applying possible transformations.\n\nTest Input:\n\n[2,5,0]\n\n[2,5,1]\n\n[3,1,1]\n\nWe need to generate the output in the same format as the examples.\n\nLet's assume that each input row generates two output rows. For example, each row is followed by a transformed version.\n\nBut how?\n\nLooking at Example0:\n\nEach input row generates two output rows. For example, input row0 generates output row0 and row5. Row1 generates row1 and row4. Row2 generates row2 and row3.\n\nBut this is speculative. Let's think of each output row as being the input row followed by some transformation, and then the same for the columns.\n\nAlternatively, the output is created by rotating the input matrix and appending it.\n\nBut I'm not making progress. Maybe it's better to look for a pattern in the numbers.\n\nAnother observation: In the output, each row has six elements. The first three are the input row. The next three seem to be derived from other parts of the matrix. For example:\n\nIn Example0's row0: next three elements are 0,8,8. These could be the last element of the same row (0), then the first element (8), then first again.\n\nIn row1: next three are 3,5,5. Third element of row1 (3), then second (5), then second again.\n\nIn row2: next three are 2,3,0. Third, second, first elements of row2.\n\nThen, row3 is same as row2.\n\nRow4: next three are 3,5,8. Third element of row1 (3), second of row1 (5), first of row0 (8).\n\nRow5: next three are 0,5,8. Third element of row0 (0), second of row0 (5), first of row0 (8).\n\nSo perhaps the pattern is:\n\nFor the first three output rows (0-2):\n\n- Row0: original row0 followed by [row0[2], row0[0], row0[0]]\n\n- Row1: original row1 followed by [row1[2], row1[1], row1[1]]\n\n- Row2: original row2 followed by [row2[2], row2[1], row2[0]]\n\nFor the next three rows (3-5):\n\n- Row3: same as row2's output.\n\n- Row4: [row1[1], row1[1], row1[2]] followed by [row1[2], row1[1], row0[0]]\n\n- Row5: [row0[0], row0[0], row0[2]] followed by [row0[2], row0[1], row0[0]]\n\nApplying this to Example0:\n\nRow4's first three: row1[1] is 5, so 5,5, row1[2] is 3 \u2192 [5,5,3]. Next three: row1[2] is 3, row1[1] 5, row0[0] 8 \u2192 [3,5,8]. So row4 is [5,5,3,3,5,8], which matches.\n\nRow5's first three: row0[0] is 8, so 8,8, row0[2] is 0 \u2192 [8,8,0]. Next three: row0[2] 0, row0[1] 5, row0[0] 8 \u2192 [0,5,8]. So row5 is [8,8,0,0,5,8], which matches.\n\nThis seems to hold for Example0. Let's check Example1.\n\nExample1's input:\n\n[3,8,2]\n\n[3,2,2]\n\n[8,5,2]\n\nOutput rows:\n\nRow0: [3,8,2,8,3,3]\n\nRow1: [3,2,2,5,2,8]\n\nRow2: [8,5,2,2,2,2]\n\nRow3: [2,2,2,2,5,8]\n\nRow4: [8,2,5,2,2,3]\n\nRow5: [3,3,8,2,8,3]\n\nApplying the pattern:\n\nRow0: [3,8,2] followed by [row0[2]=2, row0[0]=3, row0[0]=3 \u2192 2,3,3]. But output is 8,3,3. Doesn't match. So this pattern doesn't hold.\n\nSo perhaps the pattern is different.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the appended elements are taken from the next row's elements. For example, row0's appended elements are taken from row1 or row2.\n\nIn Example0 row0's appended elements are 0,8,8. Row2's first element is 0. So maybe row0's appended elements are [row2[0], row0[0], row0[0]].\n\nRow1's appended elements are 3,5,5. row1's own third element is 3, and row1's second element is 5. So [3,5,5].\n\nRow2's appended elements are 2,3,0. Which is the reverse of row2's elements [0,3,2] \u2192 reversed is [2,3,0].\n\nRow3 is same as row2's appended.\n\nRow4's appended elements are 3,5,8. row1's third element is 3, row1's second 5, row0's first 8. So [3,5,8].\n\nRow5's appended elements are 0,5,8. row0's third element 0, row0's second 5, row0's first 8 \u2192 [0,5,8].\n\nThis seems to fit for Example0, but does it work for Example1?\n\nExample1's input:\n\nRow0:3,8,2\n\nRow1:3,2,2\n\nRow2:8,5,2\n\nRow0's appended elements: [row2[0]=8, row0[0]=3, row0[0]=3 \u2192 8,3,3]. Which matches the output row0's appended elements 8,3,3.\n\nRow1's appended elements: [row2[1]=5, row1[0]=3, row1[0]=3 \u2192 5,3,3]. But actual appended elements are 5,2,8. Doesn't match. Hmm.\n\nWait, no. Maybe the pattern for appended elements is different. For row0, it's [row2[0], row0[0], row0[0]]. For row1, it's [row2[1], row1[0], row1[0]]. For row2, it's [row2[2], row2[1], row2[0]].\n\nIn Example0, row1's appended elements would be [row2[1] =3, row1[0]=8, row1[0]=8 \u2192 3,8,8]. But actual appended elements in Example0 row1 are 3,5,5. So this doesn't fit.\n\nThis approach isn't working. Let's try to find another pattern.\n\nAnother observation: In Example0's output, the last three rows are a mirror or rotation of the first three. For example, row5 is the reverse of row0's appended elements. But not exactly.\n\nAlternatively, the output is built by placing the original matrix in the top-left and various transformations in other quadrants. For example:\n\nTop-left: original matrix.\n\nTop-right: original matrix rotated 90 degrees.\n\nBottom-left: original matrix rotated 180 degrees.\n\nBottom-right: original matrix rotated 270 degrees.\n\nBut this would require a 6x6 matrix formed by four 3x3 matrices, which doesn't fit. Alternatively, each quadrant is a 3x3 matrix, leading to 6x6, but the examples don't align with this.\n\nAlternatively, each row in the output is built from the original matrix's elements arranged in a spiral or other pattern.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider that the output is a combination of the original matrix and its transpose. For a 3x3 matrix, the transpose would be 3x3. So combining them horizontally would make 3x6. Then, stacking vertically would require duplication. But the output is 6x6.\n\nThis isn't adding up.\n\nAt this point, I'm stuck. Perhaps I should look for a different approach. Let's think of the output as a combination of the original matrix and its elements summed or manipulated in some way.\n\nAlternatively, the output could be the result of some mathematical operation applied to the input elements. For example, adding elements, multiplying, etc.\n\nAlternatively, each output element is the sum of certain input elements. For example, output[i][j] = input[i][j] + input[j][i]. But this doesn't fit the examples.\n\nAnother idea: The output is generated by creating a larger matrix where each element is mirrored around certain axes. For example, the left half is the original matrix, and the right half is a mirror image. But the examples show more complex patterns.\n\nAlternatively, the output is generated by concatenating each row with its reverse, then stacking the reversed rows underneath. For example:\n\nFor Example0's row0: [8,5,0] \u2192 concatenate with reversed [0,5,8] \u2192 [8,5,0,0,5,8]. But the actual output row0 is [8,5,0,0,8,8]. Doesn't match.\n\nAlternatively, concatenate with a modified reverse. For example, [8,5,0] \u2192 [8,5,0,0,8,8]. The reverse is [0,5,8], but modified to [0,8,8]. How? Maybe the first element of the reversed part is the third element of the original, and the next two are the first element.\n\nSo, reversed modified part for row0 is [0,8,8]. This would fit. Let's test this for other rows.\n\nExample0 row1: [8,5,3] \u2192 modified reverse part would be [3,5,5]. Which matches the output.\n\nRow2: [0,3,2] \u2192 modified reverse part is [2,3,0]. Which matches the output.\n\nThen, the next three rows could be the same as the first three but modified in some way. For example, row3 is same as row2. Row4 is the modified reverse of row1's reversed part. Row5 is the modified reverse of row0's reversed part.\n\nFor Example0:\n\nRow4: [5,5,3,3,5,8]. The first three elements could be the modified reverse of row1's reversed part [3,5,8] \u2192 [5,5,3]. How? Maybe take the second element twice and the third.\n\nRow5: [8,8,0,0,5,8]. Modified reverse of row0's reversed part [0,8,8] \u2192 [8,8,0]. Then appended with [0,5,8].\n\nThis is getting too vague. Maybe the pattern is:\n\nFor each input row, the output has two rows:\n\n- The first row is the original row followed by [c, a, a], where c is the third element of the row, a is the first.\n\n- The second row is [b, b, c] followed by [c, b, a], where b is the second element, c is third, a is first.\n\nBut this doesn't fit all examples.\n\nAlternatively, the output is generated by creating a 6x6 matrix where each element (i,j) is determined by:\n\nIf i < 3 and j <3: input[i][j]\n\nIf i <3 and j >=3: input[i][2 - (j-3)]\n\nIf i >=3 and j <3: input[2 - (i-3)][j]\n\nIf i >=3 and j >=3: input[2 - (i-3)][2 - (j-3)]\n\nThis would be a mirroring of the input matrix both horizontally and vertically. Let's check:\n\nFor Example0's row0, j >=3:\n\nj=3: 2 -0=2 \u2192 input[0][2] =0\n\nj=4: 2-1=1 \u2192 input[0][1] =5\n\nj=5:2-2=0 \u2192 input[0][0] =8\n\nSo the appended elements would be 0,5,8. But in Example0's output row0, the appended elements are 0,8,8. Doesn't match. So this isn't the case.\n\nAt this point, I'm running out of ideas. Given the time constraints, perhaps I should make an educated guess based on the patterns observed.\n\nIn the examples, each input row is followed by three elements derived from the same row. For example:\n\nIn Example0:\n\nRow0: [8,5,0] \u2192 appended [0,8,8]\n\nRow1: [8,5,3] \u2192 appended [3,5,5]\n\nRow2: [0,3,2] \u2192 appended [2,3,0]\n\nThen, the next three rows are transformations of these. For example, row3 is the same as row2. Row4 and row5 might be transformations of the other rows.\n\nAnother possible pattern: The appended elements are [c, a, a] for row0, [c, b, b] for row1, [c, b, a] for row2.\n\nThen, the next three rows are:\n\nRow3: same as row2's appended elements.\n\nRow4: [b, b, c] followed by [c, b, a].\n\nRow5: [a, a, c] followed by [c, b, a].\n\nApplying this to Example0:\n\nRow4: [5,5,3] followed by [3,5,8] \u2192 which matches Example0's row4: [5,5,3,3,5,8].\n\nRow5: [8,8,0] followed by [0,5,8] \u2192 matches Example0's row5: [8,8,0,0,5,8].\n\nFor Example1:\n\nInput row0:3,8,2 \u2192 appended [2,3,3] (c=2, a=3)\n\nBut the output row0's appended is 8,3,3. So this doesn't fit.\n\nThis inconsistency suggests that the pattern may be more complex. Perhaps the appended elements are taken from different rows. For example:\n\nFor row0, appended elements are [c, a, a], where c is row0's third, a is row0's first.\n\nFor row1, appended elements are [c, b, b], where c is row1's third, b is row1's second.\n\nFor row2, appended elements are [c, b, a], where c is row2's third, b is row2's second, a is row2's first.\n\nThen, row3 is the same as row2's appended part.\n\nRow4's first three elements are [b, b, c] from row1's elements (b=5, c=3) \u2192 [5,5,3], followed by [c of row1, b of row1, a of row0] \u2192 [3,5,8].\n\nRow5's first three elements are [a, a, c] from row0 \u2192 [8,8,0], followed by [c of row0, b of row0, a of row0] \u2192 [0,5,8].\n\nThis seems to fit Example0 and Example2.\n\nApplying this pattern to the Test Input:\n\nTest Input:\n\nRow0: [2,5,0] \u2192 a=2, b=5, c=0.\n\nRow1: [2,5,1] \u2192 a=2, b=5, c=1.\n\nRow2: [3,1,1] \u2192 a=3, b=1, c=1.\n\nFollowing the pattern:\n\nOutput rows 0-2:\n\nRow0: [2,5,0, 0,2,2] \u2192 appended [c=0, a=2, a=2].\n\nRow1: [2,5,1, 1,5,5] \u2192 appended [c=1, b=5, b=5].\n\nRow2: [3,1,1, 1,1,3] \u2192 appended [c=1, b=1, a=3].\n\nRow3: same as row2's appended \u2192 [3,1,1, 1,1,3].\n\nRow4: [5,5,1, 1,5,2] \u2192 first three [b=5 (from row1), 5,1 (c of row1)], followed by [1 (c of row1),5 (b of row1), a of row0=2].\n\nRow5: [2,2,0, 0,5,2] \u2192 first three [a=2 (row0), 2,0 (c of row0)], followed by [0 (c of row0),5 (b of row0),2 (a of row0)].\n\nPutting this together, the output would be:\n\n[2,5,0,0,2,2]\n\n[2,5,1,1,5,5]\n\n[3,1,1,1,1,3]\n\n[3,1,1,1,1,3]\n\n[5,5,1,1,5,2]\n\n[2,2,0,0,5,2]\n\nBut checking against the training examples' format, especially Example0 and Example1, the rows after the first three seem to have different patterns. For example, in Example0's row4, the first three are [5,5,3], which corresponds to row1's b=5, b=5, c=3.\n\nSimilarly, in the Test Input's row4, it would be [5,5,1] followed by [1,5,2].\n\nBut in Example0's row4, the next three elements are [3,5,8], which are row1's c=3, row1's b=5, row0's a=8. For the Test Input's row4, this would be row1's c=1, row1's b=5, row0's a=2 \u2192 1,5,2. So row4's full row would be [5,5,1,1,5,2].\n\nRow5 for Test Input would be [2,2,0,0,5,2], as per the pattern.\n\nNow, let's compare this with the format of the training examples. For example, Example0's output rows 4 and 5 are:\n\n[5,5,3,3,5,8]\n\n[8,8,0,0,5,8]\n\nWhich fits with the pattern I described.\n\nThus, applying this pattern to the Test Input should give the correct output."
