        "cot_1": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. So, the training examples show inputs and outputs that are 2D arrays. I need to see how each input row is transformed into the output row.\n\nLooking at Example 0:\n\nInput:\n[4,5,4]\n[5,5,5]\n[4,5,4]\n\nOutput:\n[0,4,0]\n[4,4,4]\n[0,4,0]\n\nHmm. The middle element in the first and third rows is 5, but in the output, it's 4. Wait, no. Wait, the input's middle element is 5 in the first row. The output has 4 there. So maybe looking for numbers that are not the same as their neighbors?\n\nWait, maybe the output is replacing certain elements with 0. Let's see. For example, in the first row of example 0: [4,5,4] becomes [0,4,0]. So the 5 in the middle is replaced by 4? Or maybe the numbers that are surrounded by higher numbers? No, because 5 is higher than 4. Wait, maybe it's the opposite. Wait, in the input, the 5 is in the middle. The output replaces the 5 with 4, but the 4s in the input become 0s. That doesn't make sense. Wait, maybe the output is the minimum of the surrounding elements? Or perhaps the pattern is about which numbers are \"peaks\" or \"valleys\".\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's about consecutive duplicates. Let's check another example.\n\nExample 1's input:\n\nFirst row: [5,5,6,6,6] becomes [6,6,0,0,0]. Hmm. The input has 5,5,6,6,6. The output starts with 6,6. Wait, but the input's first two elements are 5,5. How does that turn into 6,6? That seems odd. Maybe there's a different approach.\n\nWait, perhaps the output is keeping the same numbers as the input, except replacing certain positions with 0. Let's look for when a number is replaced by 0. In example 0's first row, 4,5,4 \u2192 0,4,0. So the 5 is replaced by 4, and the 4s are 0. Wait, but that doesn't add up. Maybe the output is taking the number that is most frequent? Or maybe the number that is in the middle of a sequence.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's about the positions where the number is different from its neighbors. For example, in the first example's first input row, 4,5,4. The middle 5 is higher than the adjacent 4s. Maybe in the output, the 5 becomes 4 (the value of the neighbors?), and the 4s become 0. But in the output, it's [0,4,0]. So the middle 5 becomes 4, and the 4s become 0. Hmm.\n\nLooking at example 1's output. The first row is [6,6,0,0,0]. The input's first row starts with 5,5,6,6,6. So the first two 5s become 6,6, and the next three 6s become 0,0,0. That's confusing. How does that happen?\n\nWait, maybe the output is the number that is the next in a sequence. Wait, example 0's input is 4,5,4. The output has 4 in the middle. So maybe the pattern is that each element is replaced by the minimum of its neighbors? Let's see: the first element (4) has neighbor 5 on the right. The minimum would be 4's left neighbor is nothing, but maybe considering only right neighbor? That might not fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's a rotation or shift. For example, in example 0, the output's middle row is [4,4,4], which is the same as the input's middle row [5,5,5] replaced by 4. Wait, that can't be. The input's middle row is all 5s, and output is all 4s. So how does 5 become 4? Maybe the surrounding numbers of the middle row are 4s. Since the middle row is surrounded by rows of 4 and 4, maybe the middle row's elements are replaced by the surrounding values. But that's a stretch.\n\nLooking at example 2's input and output. The first input row is [9,5,9,9,9], which becomes [0,9,0,0,0]. The 5 in position 1 is replaced by 9, and the 9s around it become 0. So maybe when a number is lower than its neighbors, it's replaced by the neighbor's value, and the neighbors become 0. But in example 0, the 5 is higher than its neighbors (4s), so perhaps that's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is created by checking for each element if it's a local minimum. A local minimum is an element that is smaller than its neighbors. So in example 0's first row: 4,5,4. The first 4 is a local minimum if the next element is higher. But the next element is 5, which is higher. The middle 5 is higher than both, so not a minimum. The last 4 is also a local minimum. But in the output, the middle element is 4 and the edges are 0. So maybe that's not the case.\n\nAnother angle: looking at the output arrays, the non-zero elements seem to form certain patterns. For example, in example 0's output, the middle row is all 4s, and the first and third rows have a 4 in the middle. Wait, no, the output for example 0 is:\n\n[0,4,0]\n[4,4,4]\n[0,4,0]\n\nSo the middle row is all 4s, and the other rows have a 4 in the center. But the input's middle row was all 5s. So how does that 5 become 4? Maybe the 5 is replaced by the value that's present in the surrounding rows. The input's middle row is between rows of 4,5,4 and 4,5,4. So the middle row's elements are 5s. The output's middle row is 4s. So maybe the 5 is replaced by the value of the surrounding rows (4) and the edges are 0. But how does that explain other examples.\n\nLooking at example 1's input and output. The output's first row is [6,6,0,0,0]. The input's first row is [5,5,6,6,6]. So the first two elements (5,5) become 6,6. The next three 6s become 0. Maybe there's a shift. Like the elements are shifted left, but with some wrapping. Or maybe each element is replaced by the next element in some way.\n\nWait, perhaps the output is created by looking for runs of the same number. In example 1's input first row: 5,5,6,6,6. The output is 6,6,0,0,0. Maybe the runs are being shifted. For example, the first two 5s are replaced by the next run's value (6), and the 6s are replaced by 0. So perhaps each group of the same number is replaced by the next group's value. So in the input first row, the first group is two 5s, next group is three 6s. So the 5s are replaced by 6s, and the 6s are replaced by 0s (maybe the last group wraps around to 0?). Then the output would be 6,6,0,0,0, which matches.\n\nIn example 0's input first row: 4,5,4. The groups are 4 (single), 5 (single), 4 (single). So each is replaced by the next group's value. The next group after 4 is 5, so the first 4 becomes 5? But the output is 0,4,0. Hmm, that doesn't fit. So maybe that's not the pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking each element and replacing it with the next element in the row, except for the last element which wraps around to the first. But example 0's first input row would become [5,4,4], which doesn't match the output [0,4,0].\n\nAnother approach: look for the output numbers. In example 0, the output numbers are 4s and 0s. The input has 4s and 5s. So maybe 5s are turned into 4s, and 4s into 0s. But that's not the case in the middle row, where all 5s become 4s. So perhaps the rule is that the output is the minimum value in the input grid. Wait, example 0's grid has 4s and 5s. The output uses 4s and 0s. The minimum is 4, so 5 becomes 4, and 4 becomes 0? That doesn't make sense. But how would 4 turn into 0?\n\nAlternatively, maybe each element is replaced by the sum of its adjacent elements modulo something. But example 0's first row's middle element is 5. Adjacents are 4 and 4. Sum is 8. But output is 4. 8 mod 5 is 3, which doesn't fit. Hmm.\n\nLooking at example 2's input and output. The input's first row is [9,5,9,9,9], output [0,9,0,0,0]. So the 5 becomes 9, and the 9s around become 0. The 5 is surrounded by 9s. Maybe when a number is surrounded by higher numbers, it's replaced by the higher number, and the higher numbers become 0. But in example 0's first row, the 5 is surrounded by 4s. So it's lower than the 5. So that might not fit.\n\nWait, maybe the rule is: for each element, if it is not the same as the majority of its adjacent elements (left, right, up, down), replace it with the majority value, else 0. But how to determine adjacency. Alternatively, maybe for each element, if it's a unique value in its immediate neighborhood (including itself), it's kept, otherwise replaced by 0.\n\nAlternatively, considering that in example 0's output, the middle row is all 4s. The input's middle row is all 5s. So maybe in rows that are surrounded by other rows, the middle row's elements are replaced by the value from the surrounding rows. The input's middle row is [5,5,5], and the rows above and below are [4,5,4]. So maybe each 5 in the middle is replaced by 4 (the value from the surrounding rows), but that doesn't explain why the output's middle row is 4,4,4. Because the surrounding rows have 4 in the edges and 5 in the middle. Wait, perhaps it's taking the mode of the surrounding elements. For the middle row's elements in example 0, each 5 is surrounded by 4s above and below. So the mode is 4, so replace 5 with 4. Then, for the edges of the first row, the 4s are surrounded by 5s (below), so maybe their surrounding elements are 5s and 4. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's about the frequency of the number in the entire grid. For example, in example 0, there are more 4s than 5s. Wait, input grid:\n\nRow 0: 4,5,4 \u2192 3 elements (two 4s, one 5)\nRow 1: 5,5,5 \u2192 three 5s\nRow 2: 4,5,4 \u2192 same as row 0\nTotal: 4s: 4 elements (two in row 0, two in row 2)\n5s: 5 elements (three in row 1, one in row 0, one in row 2)\nSo 5s are more frequent. But the output uses 4s. So that's not directly applicable.\n\nAlternatively, looking for a pattern where the output is a shifted version of the input, with some elements zeroed. For example, in example 1's input first row: [5,5,6,6,6], output is [6,6,0,0,0]. So perhaps the first two elements are replaced by the next group's value. The next group is 6,6,6, so the first two 5s become 6s, and the next three 6s become 0s. Then, the pattern is that each group of numbers is replaced by the value of the next group, and the last group becomes 0s. Let's test this.\n\nIn example 1's first row, the groups are 5,5 (length 2), followed by 6,6,6 (length 3). So the first group is replaced by the next group's value (6) for the same length, which is 2 elements \u2192 6,6. The next group (length 3) is replaced by the next group's value. But there are no more groups after that, so replaced by 0s \u2192 0,0,0. Thus, the output is [6,6,0,0,0], which matches.\n\nSimilarly, example 0's first row: groups are 4 (length 1), 5 (length 1), 4 (length 1). The next group after 4 is 5, then after 5 is 4. So each group is replaced by the next group's value. So the first 4 is replaced by 5 (length 1), then the 5 is replaced by 4 (length 1), then the next 4 would be replaced by... there's no next group, so replaced by 0. But the output is [0,4,0]. Hmm, that doesn't fit. So maybe this pattern works for example 1 but not example 0.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the last group is replaced by 0s regardless. Let's see example 0's first row: groups are 4, 5, 4. So the first group (4) is replaced by the next group's value (5), but only for length 1. Then the next group (5) is replaced by next group (4). The last group (4) is replaced by 0. So the output would be [5,4,0]. But the actual output is [0,4,0]. So that doesn't match. So perhaps this isn't the right pattern.\n\nAnother angle: look for the output's non-zero elements. In example 0's output, the non-zero elements form a cross. The middle row is all 4s, and the middle element of the other rows is 4. Similarly, example 1's output forms a diagonal pattern of 6s. Example 2's output has 9s in certain positions. Maybe the non-zero elements in the output are those that are part of a cycle or a certain arrangement.\n\nWait, example 1's output is:\n\n[6,6,0,0,0]\n[0,6,6,0,0]\n[0,0,6,6,0]\n[0,0,0,6,6]\n[6,0,0,0,6]\n\nThis looks like a diagonal pattern where each row's 6s are shifted by one position to the right compared to the previous row, and the last row wraps around. So it's forming a circular diagonal pattern.\n\nExample 2's output has:\n\n[0,9,0,0,0]\n[0,0,9,9,0]\n[0,9,0,0,0]\n[0,0,9,0,0]\n[0,0,0,9,9]\n\nThe 9s are in varying positions. Maybe the output is the input's elements transformed such that each occurrence of a certain number is replaced by another, but that's not clear.\n\nAnother approach: look at the number of elements in the input and output. All examples are square matrices. The output's non-zero elements might form a certain shape. For example, in example 0, it's a cross; in example 1, a diagonal ring. Maybe the pattern is related to the positions of the elements in the matrix. But how?\n\nAlternatively, think of the output as highlighting the numbers that form a certain pattern in the input. For example, in example 0's input, the middle element of each row is 5, but in the output, it's 4. The surrounding elements are 4. So maybe the output is replacing elements that are part of a certain structure (like a diamond) with a different value.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is created by replacing each element with the value of the element that is k steps away in a certain direction, then zeroing others. But without more examples, it's hard to tell.\n\nWait, let's take the test input and see if applying the possible patterns gives a plausible output. The test input is:\n\n[3,3,3,5,3]\n[3,5,3,3,3]\n[3,5,5,3,5]\n[3,3,3,5,3]\n[5,5,5,3,3]\n\nIf we consider the pattern from example 1 where groups of numbers are replaced by the next group's value and the last group becomes 0s. Let's check the first row of the test input: [3,3,3,5,3]. The groups are three 3s, then a single 5, then a single 3. The next group after the first three 3s is the 5. So replacing the first three 3s with 5s (length 3?), but the next group (5) has length 1, so replaced by 3 (the next group's value?), then the last 3 is replaced by 0. But the output would be [5,5,5,3,0]. But looking at the training examples' outputs, especially example 1, the replaced groups are of the same length as the original group. So for the first group of two 5s in example 1, it's replaced by two 6s. Then the next group of three 6s is replaced by three 0s. So perhaps the test input's first row has three 3s, which would be replaced by the next group's value (5), same length (3 elements). So the first three 3s become three 5s. The next group is a single 5, which is replaced by the next group's value (3), but since that's a single element, it becomes 3. The last 3 is the last group, replaced by 0. So the first row would become [5,5,5,3,0]. But the output from the training examples in example 1 has the next group's value. So in example 1, the first group is two 5s, replaced by two 6s. Then three 6s replaced by three 0s. So the last group becomes 0s. So applying this to the test input's first row:\n\nGroups: 3 (3), 5 (1), 3 (1). So the first group (3s) length 3, next group is 5 (length 1). So replace the first 3 elements with 5s (length 3), then the 5 becomes 3 (next group's value, length 1), and the last 3 becomes 0. So the first row would be [5,5,5,3,0]. But the output from example 1's first row is [6,6,0,0,0]. Which aligns with replacing the first group (length 2) with next group's value (6, length 3?), but no. Wait, example 1's input first row is [5,5,6,6,6], which has groups 5 (2), 6 (3). So replacing the first group (2) with 6, then the next group (3) with 0. So the output is [6,6,0,0,0]. So the length of the replacement is the same as the original group. So group of 2 \u2192 replaced by next group's value (6) for 2 elements, then next group of 3 \u2192 replaced by 0s for 3 elements.\n\nApplying that to the test input's first row: groups are 3 (3), 5 (1), 3 (1). So first group (3 elements) \u2192 replaced by next group's value (5) for 3 elements. Then next group (5, 1 element) \u2192 replaced by next group's value (3) for 1 element. Then next group (3, 1 element) \u2192 replaced by 0s (since no next group) for 1 element. So the first row becomes [5,5,5,3,0]. But what about the actual output for this test input?\n\nLooking at the training examples, the outputs often have 0s where the original group was, except for the first part. So perhaps the pattern is that each group in the input is replaced by the value of the next group in the row, and the last group is replaced by 0s. Let's test this with example 0.\n\nExample 0's input first row: [4,5,4]. Groups are 4 (1), 5 (1), 4 (1). Next group after 4 is 5, then 4. So first group (4) \u2192 replaced by 5 (1 element). Second group (5) \u2192 replaced by 4 (1 element). Third group (4) \u2192 replaced by 0 (1 element). So output would be [5,4,0], but the actual output is [0,4,0]. So this doesn't fit. Therefore, this pattern is not consistent.\n\nAlternative idea: in example 1's output, each row has two 6s followed by three 0s, then in the next row, shifted. This looks like a rotating pattern. Maybe the output is a shifted version of the input's groups. For example, shifting each group to the left, with the last group becoming zeros. But not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the input's elements shifted to the right by one, with the last element becoming the first, but that doesn't fit example 1's first row.\n\nHmm, this is tricky. Let's look for another pattern.\n\nIn example 0's output, the non-zero elements are 4s, which is the minimum value of the input. But example 1's output uses 6s, which is the maximum of the input. Example 2 uses 9s, which is the maximum. So perhaps the output uses the maximum value of the input. Let's check:\n\nExample 0's input: values 4 and 5. Max is 5. Output uses 4. So that doesn't fit. So not.\n\nWait, example 1's input has 5,5,6,6,6 in the first row. Max is 6, which is used in the output. Example 2's input has 9 and 5. Max is 9, output uses 9. Example 0's input has max 5, but output uses 4. So maybe this isn't the case.\n\nAnother observation: in example 0's input, the output's middle row is all 4s, which is the value from the surrounding rows. The input's middle row is 5s. So perhaps rows that are surrounded by other rows take the value of those surrounding rows, and the edges are zeroed. But how does this apply to other examples.\n\nLooking at example 1's input, which is a 5x5 matrix. The output has a diagonal pattern. Each row's 6s are shifted one to the right. This might suggest that the output is a rotated or shifted version of the input's maximum values arranged in a diagonal.\n\nAlternatively, the output could be highlighting a path through the matrix. For example, in example 1's output, the 6s form a diagonal that wraps around, creating a circular pattern. This could be a knight's tour or some other path.\n\nAlternatively, the output might be highlighting elements that are part of a certain sequence. For example, elements where the value is the same as the previous row's next column, but this is too vague.\n\nAlternatively, considering that each output row's non-zero elements are the next group in the input row. For example, in example 1's input first row, groups are 5,5 followed by 6,6,6. The output first row is 6,6 followed by 0,0,0. So the first group is replaced by the next group's value. Then the next group is replaced by 0s. If this is the case, then for the test input's first row [3,3,3,5,3], the groups are 3,3,3 then 5 then 3. So the first group (3,3,3) would be replaced by 5,5,5 (same length), then the next group (5) would be replaced by 3, and the last group (3) would be replaced by 0. So the output row would be [5,5,5,3,0]. \n\nBut looking at the training examples, the replaced groups are the same length. So example 1's first group of two 5s becomes two 6s, then three 6s become three 0s. So applying this to the test input's first row, the first three 3s become three 5s (next group's value), then the 5 becomes one 3 (next group's value), and the last 3 becomes 0. So output row would be [5,5,5,3,0]. \n\nBut looking at the other training examples, let's check example 2's first row input [9,5,9,9,9], which has groups: 9, followed by 5, followed by 9,9,9. So the first group (1 element) is replaced by next group's value (5), but the output's first element is 0. Hmm, that doesn't fit. So this pattern might not hold.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the pattern is that each element in the output is the value of the next element in the input row, with the last element wrapping around to the first. For example, example 1's first input row [5,5,6,6,6] would become [5,6,6,6,5] when shifted left, but the output is [6,6,0,0,0], which doesn't match. So no.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is created by replacing each element with the value that appears after it in the row, and the last occurrence is replaced by 0. For example, in example 0's first row [4,5,4], the next after 4 is 5, then after 5 is 4, then after 4 is nothing \u2192 0. So output would be [5,4,0], but the actual output is [0,4,0]. So that's not matching.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps the output is the difference between the current element and the next element. But example 0's first row [4,5,4] would give differences of 1, -1, which would not produce [0,4,0].\n\nHmm. This is challenging. Let's think of another approach. Maybe the output is the input matrix rotated 180 degrees and then subtracted from the original, but that seems unlikely.\n\nAlternatively, considering the positions of certain numbers. For example, in example 0, the output has 4s where the input has 5s. So maybe any number that is higher than its adjacent elements is replaced by the adjacent value, and others are replaced by 0. For example, in the first row of example 0, the middle 5 is higher than its left and right 4s, so replaced by 4, and the 4s are lower than the middle 5, so replaced by 0. So the output is [0,4,0]. But in the middle row of example 0, all are 5s. If they are surrounded by 4s in the rows above and below, then the 5s are higher than their vertical neighbors, so replaced by 4. Hence, middle row becomes [4,4,4]. The other rows have 4s which are lower than the middle 5, so replaced by 0. \n\nThis seems possible. Let's check example 1. The first input row is [5,5,6,6,6]. The output is [6,6,0,0,0]. So for each element, if it's higher than its adjacent elements, replace with adjacent value. But wait, in the first row, the 6s are higher than the previous 5s. So perhaps the 6s are higher than their left neighbors, so replaced by the left neighbor's value (5), but that would give 5 instead of 6. Hmm, this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is the value of the highest neighbor. For example, in example 0's first row middle 5 has neighbors 4 and 4. Highest is 4? No. Wait, that doesn't make sense. The 5 is higher than its neighbors, so the highest neighbor is 4. So the output would be 4. Then the 4s on the edges have neighbors 5 (middle) and nothing. So their highest neighbor is 5. So they are replaced by 5. But the output is 0 for them, so that's not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the value of the neighbor that is different. For example, if an element is the same as its left and right neighbors, it's replaced by 0. If it's different, replaced by the differing value. But example 0's first row middle 5 is different from its neighbors, so replaced by 4 (the neighbor's value?), but both neighbors are 4. So maybe the element is replaced by the value of the neighbor that is different. But in this case, both are 4, so replaced by 4, and the 4s are replaced by 0. That fits example 0's first row output. Let's check example 1.\n\nExample 1's first input row is [5,5,6,6,6]. The first two 5s are followed by 6s. So the third element (6) is different from the previous (5). So maybe the first two 5s are replaced by the next different value (6), and the three 6s are replaced by 0s. So the output would be [6,6,0,0,0], which matches. \n\nThis seems promising. So the pattern could be: for each group of consecutive identical numbers in a row, replace them with the value of the next different number in the row, and if there is no next different number, replace with 0. \n\nTesting this with example 0's first row:\n\nInput: [4,5,4]\nGroups: 4 (1), 5 (1), 4 (1)\nNext different after 4 is 5. So replace the first 4 with 5. Next different after 5 is 4. Replace 5 with 4. Next different after 4 is none, so replace with 0. Output would be [5,4,0]. But the actual output is [0,4,0]. So this doesn't fit. So maybe it's the previous different number?\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is: each element is replaced by the value of the next different element in the row, wrapping around. If the entire row is the same, replace with 0. For example, example 0's middle row is all 5s, so replaced by 0. But the output is [4,4,4]. So that doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. Let's try another angle. Let's look at the test input and see if we can find a pattern. The test input is:\n\n[3,3,3,5,3]\n[3,5,3,3,3]\n[3,5,5,3,5]\n[3,3,3,5,3]\n[5,5,5,3,3]\n\nFollowing the pattern from example 1, where groups are replaced by the next group's value and last group becomes 0. Let's process each row:\n\nFirst row: [3,3,3,5,3]. Groups are three 3s, one 5, one 3. So first group (3s) replaced by next group's value (5) for three elements. Next group (5) replaced by next group's value (3) for one element. Last group (3) becomes 0. So output row would be [5,5,5,3,0].\n\nSecond row: [3,5,3,3,3]. Groups are 3, 5, 3,3,3. Wait, grouping consecutive same numbers: first group is one 3, then one 5, then three 3s. So first group (3) replaced by next group's value (5) for one element \u2192 5. Next group (5) replaced by next group's value (3) for one element \u2192 3. Next group (three 3s) replaced by next group (none) \u2192 0,0,0. So output row would be [5,3,0,0,0].\n\nThird row: [3,5,5,3,5]. Groups are one 3, two 5s, one 3, one 5. So first group (3) \u2192 replaced by next group (5) for one element \u2192 5. Next group (two 5s) \u2192 replaced by next group (3) for two elements \u2192 3,3. Next group (3) \u2192 replaced by next group (5) \u2192 one 5. Last group (5) \u2192 0. So output row: [5,3,3,5,0].\n\nFourth row: [3,3,3,5,3]. Same as first row \u2192 output [5,5,5,3,0].\n\nFifth row: [5,5,5,3,3]. Groups: three 5s, two 3s. So first group (5s) replaced by next group's value (3) for three elements \u2192 3,3,3. Next group (two 3s) \u2192 replaced by next group (none) \u2192 0,0. So output row: [3,3,3,0,0].\n\nBut the training examples' outputs have a certain structure. For example, example 1's output has a diagonal of 6s. The test input's output, according to this pattern, would have rows with varying values, but I'm not sure if this matches the expected pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the input shifted left by one, with each group shifted. But example 1's first row input [5,5,6,6,6] becomes [6,6,0,0,0], which is like shifting left two positions and replacing with zeros. Not sure.\n\nAnother possible pattern: each element in the output is the value of the first different element to its right in the input row. If there's no different element, it's 0.\n\nFor example 1's first row:\n\n[5,5,6,6,6]\n\nFor the first two 5s, the first different element to the right is 6. So both 5s become 6. The 6s have no different element to the right, so they become 0. So output is [6,6,0,0,0], which matches.\n\nExample 0's first row:\n\n[4,5,4]\n\nThe first element (4) has next different element 5 \u2192 becomes 5. The middle element (5) has next different element 4 \u2192 becomes 4. The last element (4) has no next different element \u2192 becomes 0. So output would be [5,4,0], but the actual output is [0,4,0]. So this doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. But the actual output for example 0's first row is [0,4,0]. So why is the first 4 replaced by 0?\n\nWait, maybe the rule is that each element is replaced by the previous different element in the row. For example, in example 0's first row:\n\n[4,5,4]\n\nFirst element (4) has no previous element \u2192 0. Second element (5) has previous different element 4 \u2192 4. Third element (4) has previous different element 5 \u2192 5. But output is [0,4,0]. So this doesn't fit either.\n\nAlternatively, maybe elements are replaced by the first different element to the left or right. For example, the first 4 in example 0's first row has a different element to the right (5), so becomes 5. The middle 5 has different elements on both sides (4s), so becomes 4. The last 4 has a different element to the left (5), so becomes 5. But output is [0,4,0]. So this doesn't fit.\n\nThis is very confusing. Let's think about example 2's first row input and output:\n\nInput: [9,5,9,9,9]\nOutput: [0,9,0,0,0]\n\nAccording to the previous pattern where elements are replaced by the first different element to the right, the first 9's next different element is 5 \u2192 5. But output is 0. So this doesn't fit. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the value of the element that is two positions to the right, wrapping around. For example, in example 0's first row:\n\n[4,5,4] \u2192 index 0: 4 \u2192 4 (index 0 +2 mod 3 = 2 \u2192 4). So output would be [4,4,5], which doesn't match.\n\nThis is getting me nowhere. Let's try to find another angle. Maybe the output is the result of a convolution or some kernel operation. For example, each element is replaced by the sum or product of its neighbors.\n\nIn example 0's first row:\n\n[4,5,4] \u2192 middle 5 has neighbors 4 and 4. Sum is 8. If output is sum modulo something, but 8 mod 5 is 3, which isn't 4. So no.\n\nAlternatively, the output for each element is the minimum of its neighbors. For the first and last elements, which have only one neighbor. So first element's neighbor is 5 \u2192 min is 5. Middle element's neighbors are 4 and 4 \u2192 min 4. Last element's neighbor is 5 \u2192 min 5. So output would be [5,4,5], but the actual output is [0,4,0]. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, the output is the difference between the element and the average of its neighbors. For example, middle element 5: neighbors average is (4+4)/2 = 4. 5-4=1. Output would be 1, but actual is 4. So no.\n\nAnother idea: looking at the output matrices, the non-zero values seem to form certain shapes. For example, in example 0, the output is a cross. In example 1, a diagonal ring. In example 2, scattered 9s. Perhaps the pattern is about the positions of elements that are part of a certain structure, like being on the perimeter, or certain diagonals. \n\nExample 0's output is a cross: middle row and middle column. Example 1's output is a diagonal pattern that shifts each row. Example 2's output seems to have a mix of positions. But how does that relate to the input?\n\nAlternatively, the output could be the input's elements rotated or reflected. But example 0's input is a 3x3 matrix, output is cross shape. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the output is the input matrix with all but the second occurrence of each number in each row set to zero. For example, in example 1's first row, the input has two 5s followed by three 6s. The output has two 6s followed by zeros. Maybe the second occurrence is kept. But not sure.\n\nThis is really challenging. Let's try to summarize what we've observed:\n\n- The output matrices have the same dimensions as the input.\n- The non-zero elements in the output are typically the same value, which appears to be the value of the next group in the input row, and the rest are zeros.\n- The number of non-zero elements in each row of the output corresponds to the length of the previous group in the input row.\n\nFor example, in example 1's input first row [5,5,6,6,6], the first group is two 5s. The output's first two elements are 6s, which is the next group's value. The next group is three 6s, which are replaced by zeros. This suggests that each group in the input is replaced by the next group's value, and the last group is replaced by zeros.\n\nApplying this to the test input:\n\nTest input first row: [3,3,3,5,3]\n\nGroups:\n- 3 appears three times.\n- 5 appears once.\n- 3 appears once.\n\nSo, the first group (3,3,3) is replaced by the next group's value (5) for three elements \u2192 [5,5,5].\nThe next group (5) is replaced by the next group's value (3) for one element \u2192 [3].\nThe last group (3) is replaced by zeros (one element) \u2192 [0].\nThus, the output row would be [5,5,5,3,0].\n\nSecond row of test input: [3,5,3,3,3]\n\nGroups:\n- 3 once.\n- 5 once.\n- 3 three times.\n\nFirst group (3) \u2192 replaced by next group's value (5) for one element \u2192 [5].\nNext group (5) \u2192 replaced by next group's value (3) for one element \u2192 [3].\nNext group (3,3,3) \u2192 replaced by zeros for three elements \u2192 [0,0,0].\nOutput row: [5,3,0,0,0].\n\nThird row of test input: [3,5,5,3,5]\n\nGroups:\n- 3 once.\n- 5 twice.\n- 3 once.\n- 5 once.\n\nFirst group (3) \u2192 replaced by next group's value (5) for one element \u2192 [5].\nNext group (5,5) \u2192 replaced by next group's value (3) for two elements \u2192 [3,3].\nNext group (3) \u2192 replaced by next group's value (5) for one element \u2192 [5].\nLast group (5) \u2192 replaced by zero \u2192 [0].\nOutput row: [5,3,3,5,0].\n\nFourth row: same as first \u2192 [5,5,5,3,0].\n\nFifth row: [5,5,5,3,3]\n\nGroups:\n- 5 three times.\n- 3 twice.\n\nFirst group (5,5,5) \u2192 replaced by next group's value (3) for three elements \u2192 [3,3,3].\nNext group (3,3) \u2192 replaced by zero for two elements \u2192 [0,0].\nOutput row: [3,3,3,0,0].\n\nPutting this together, the test output would be:\n\n[5,5,5,3,0]\n[5,3,0,0,0]\n[5,3,3,5,0]\n[5,5,5,3,0]\n[3,3,3,0,0]\n\nBut looking at the training examples' outputs, example 1's output starts with 6,6,0,0,0. The non-zero elements are consecutive at the start, then zeros. But in the test input's first row, the output would be [5,5,5,3,0], which has a 3 in the fourth position. This doesn't fit the training examples' pattern where after the first group replacement, the next group's replacement follows immediately. \n\nBut wait, in example 2's output, there are non-zero elements in the middle. For example, the second row of example 2's output is [0,0,9,9,0], which corresponds to the input row [9,9,5,5,9]. The groups are 9,9 followed by 5,5 followed by 9. So the first group (9,9) is replaced by the next group's value (5,5) for two elements \u2192 but the output is 9,9. Hmm, this doesn't fit.\n\nSo perhaps the pattern isn't consistent across all examples. Maybe there's another layer to this.\n\nLooking back at example 2's input and output:\n\nInput row 0: [9,5,9,9,9] \u2192 output [0,9,0,0,0].\n\nIf applying the group replacement pattern: the first group is 9 (1 element), next group is 5 (1), then 9 (3). So first group replaced by 5 (1 element), next group replaced by 9 (1), then last group replaced by 0. So output would be [5,9,0,0,0], but actual output is [0,9,0,0,0]. So this doesn't fit.\n\nThis suggests that the pattern isn't simply replacing each group with the next group's value. So maybe there's a different pattern.\n\nAlternative idea: the output is the input where each number is replaced by the next higher number in the row, and if none, replaced by 0. For example, in example 1's first row input [5,5,6,6,6], the next higher number after 5 is 6, so replaced by 6. Then the 6s have no higher number, so replaced by 0. So output [6,6,0,0,0]. This fits. Example 0's first row input [4,5,4]: the next higher after 4 is 5, but the middle 5 has no higher next. So output [5,0,5], but actual output is [0,4,0]. Doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. Another possibility: the output is the input where each element is replaced by the value of the first occurrence of a higher number to its right. If no higher number, replaced by 0. For example, in example 1's first row:\n\n5,5,6,6,6. The first two 5s have a 6 to their right, so replaced by 6. The 6s have no higher numbers to the right, so replaced by 0. So output [6,6,0,0,0]. Fits. Example 0's first row: 4,5,4. The first 4 has a 5 to the right \u2192 replaced by 5. The 5 has no higher to the right \u2192 0. The last 4 has nothing \u2192 0. So output [5,0,0]. Doesn't match the actual [0,4,0].\n\nSo this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, the output is the first occurrence of a lower number to the right. But example 1's first row 5,5,6,6,6: lower to the right of 5 is 6 is higher. No, so replaced by 0. Doesn't fit.\n\nThis is really tough. Maybe the pattern is that each element in the output is the value of the element that is k steps ahead in the input row, where k is the value of the element. For example, in example 0's first row, 4 steps ahead would wrap around. But 4 is larger than the row length, so perhaps modulo. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each element is replaced by the value of the element at the position equal to its value. For example, if the element is 4, look at position 4. But positions are indices starting at 0, which would be out of bounds. Not applicable.\n\nAnother approach: the output matrices in the examples have a certain symmetry. Example 0's output is symmetric vertically and horizontally. Example 1's output forms a circular pattern. Maybe the output is some kind of transformation based on symmetry or rotation.\n\nGiven that I'm stuck, perhaps I should look for the pattern that in the output, the non-zero elements correspond to the positions where the input's elements are part of a certain repeating pattern. For example, in example 1's input, the 6s form a larger block, and in the output, they are replaced by zeros except for the first part, which is shifted. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the output could be the result of a cellular automaton rule. For example, each cell becomes the value of the majority of its neighbors, but example 0's middle row is all 5s surrounded by 4s, so majority would be 4. Hence replaced by 4. The edges would have neighbors from other rows, which are 5s. So perhaps. But how to apply this to other examples.\n\nIn example 0's input:\n\nThe middle row is all 5s. They are surrounded by rows of 4s. So each 5's vertical neighbors are 4s. Horizontal neighbors are also 5s. So if considering vertical neighbors only, the majority is 4. Hence replaced by 4. The first row's 4s have a vertical neighbor of 5 below. So the majority is 5. But output is 0. This doesn't fit.\n\nAnother idea: the output is the input matrix where each element is replaced by the minimum value of its adjacent elements (left, right, up, down). If an element is on the edge, it's considered to have 0 for out-of-bounds. For example, in example 0's first row, the middle element 5 has left and right 4s. Min is 4. The edges (4) have right neighbor 5 and out-of-bounds (0). So min(5, 0) = 0. Hence output [0,4,0]. Middle row's 5s have vertical neighbors 4s. So min is 4. Hence [4,4,4]. This fits example 0.\n\nExample 1's first row input [5,5,6,6,6]. The first two 5s have neighbors 5 (left), 5 (right), and below. The first element 5 has left neighbor out-of-bounds (0), right 5, and below 6. Min of 0,5,6 \u2192 0. So output would be 0. But actual output is 6. So this doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. This works for example 0 but not others. \n\nExample 2's first row input [9,5,9,9,9]. The middle element 5 has left and right 9s, and above and below 9. So min is 5's neighbors are 9s, but wait, the element itself is 5. Wait, no. The rule would be to replace each element with the min of its adjacent elements. So the 5's adjacents are 9 (left), 9 (right), and above and below 9. So min is 9. Hence replaced by 9. But in the output, the 5 becomes 9. The 9s around it have adjacents including 5 and other 9s. For example, the first 9 has right neighbor 5. So min(5, 0) \u2192 0. So output first element 0. So output row would be [0,9,0,9,9]. But actual output is [0,9,0,0,0]. So this doesn't fit.\n\nThis approach only works for example 0. So perhaps it's not the correct pattern.\n\nAfter trying multiple patterns and not finding a consistent one, I'm forced to think of another approach. Let's look at the outputs and see if they relate to the input in a different way.\n\nIn example 0, the input is:\n\n[4,5,4]\n[5,5,5]\n[4,5,4]\n\nOutput is:\n\n[0,4,0]\n[4,4,4]\n[0,4,0]\n\nNotice that the output's non-zero elements are the positions where the input's elements are part of the cross (middle row and middle column). The value 4 is the value from the surrounding rows. So perhaps, the output is creating a cross pattern where the middle row and middle column are filled with the value from the surrounding elements, and other positions are 0.\n\nIn example 1's output, the non-zero elements form a diagonal pattern. The value is 6, which is the highest in the input. So perhaps the output highlights a certain path or structure using the maximum value.\n\nIn example 2's output, the non-zero elements are 9s, which is the maximum value in the input. The positions vary, but it's possible they form a certain shape.\n\nThe test input's maximum value is 5. So the output might highlight certain positions with 5s and others with 0s.\n\nLooking at example 1's input and output, the output's 6s form a ring-like diagonal pattern. Each row's 6s are shifted one position to the right, creating a circular effect. This suggests that the output is formed by rotating or shifting the input's maximum values in a certain way.\n\nApplying this to the test input, which has a maximum of 5. The output would highlight a similar diagonal pattern with 5s.\n\nThe test input is:\n\n[3,3,3,5,3]\n[3,5,3,3,3]\n[3,5,5,3,5]\n[3,3,3,5,3]\n[5,5,5,3,3]\n\nThe maximum is 5. Looking for a diagonal pattern where each row's 5s are shifted right by one compared to the previous row. However, the input's 5s are positioned at:\n\nRow 0: index 3\n\nRow 1: index 1\n\nRow 2: indices 1,2,4\n\nRow 3: index 3\n\nRow 4: indices 0,1,2\n\nTo form a diagonal pattern like example 1's output, the output's 5s would need to shift each row. Let's see:\n\nExample 1's output starts with two 6s in row 0, then two 6s shifted right each row, wrapping around. For the test input, the output would need to have 5s arranged in a similar shifting pattern. But the input's 5s are not arranged that way. So perhaps the output is formed by taking the positions of the maximum values in the input and arranging them in a shifted diagonal pattern. But how?\n\nAlternatively, the output may be generated by creating a diagonal pattern with the maximum value, regardless of the input's positions. For example, in a 5x5 matrix, the output would have:\n\nRow 0: 5 at positions 0 and 1\n\nRow 1: 5 at positions 1 and 2\n\nRow 2: positions 2 and 3\n\nRow 3: positions 3 and 4\n\nRow 4: positions 4 and 0 (wrapping around)\n\nBut the test input's output would need to follow this pattern. However, example 1's output has this pattern. Applying this to the test input, the output would be:\n\n[5,5,0,0,0]\n[0,5,5,0,0]\n[0,0,5,5,0]\n[0,0,0,5,5]\n[5,0,0,0,5]\n\nBut the test input's actual output may vary based on the pattern. However, the test input's maximum is 5, which is present in all rows. But how does this relate to the input's structure.\n\nAlternatively, the output is a diagonal matrix where each row's non-zero elements are the maximum value of the input matrix, arranged in a shifted manner. Example 1's output fits this. So perhaps regardless of the input's arrangement, the output is a shifted diagonal of the input's maximum value. But example 0's output doesn't fit this, as it's a cross, not a diagonal.\n\nThus, this approach is inconsistent.\n\nAt this point, I'm struggling to find a consistent pattern. Given the time I've spent, perhaps the pattern is that each element in the output is the value of the next different element in the row, with the last group becoming zeros. This seems to fit example 1 and possibly the test input. Let's proceed with this pattern for the test input.\n\nApplying this to the test input:\n\nFirst row: [3,3,3,5,3] \u2192 groups are three 3s, one 5, one 3. So three 3s \u2192 replaced by 5 (next group's value) \u2192 5,5,5. Then 5 \u2192 replaced by 3 \u2192 3. Then 3 \u2192 replaced by 0. Output row: [5,5,5,3,0].\n\nSecond row: [3,5,3,3,3] \u2192 groups are 3,5,3,3,3. So 3 \u2192 replaced by 5 \u2192 5. 5 \u2192 replaced by 3 \u2192 3. 3s \u2192 replaced by 0s \u2192 0,0,0. Output: [5,3,0,0,0].\n\nThird row: [3,5,5,3,5] \u2192 groups are 3, 5,5, 3,5. So 3 \u2192 replaced by 5 \u21925. 5,5 \u2192 replaced by 3 \u21923,3. 3 \u2192 replaced by5 \u21925. 5 \u2192 replaced by0. Output: [5,3,3,5,0].\n\nFourth row: same as first \u2192 [5,5,5,3,0].\n\nFifth row: [5,5,5,3,3] \u2192 groups are 5,5,5, 3,3. So 5s \u2192 replaced by 3 \u21923,3,3. 3s \u2192 replaced by 0 \u21920,0. Output: [3,3,3,0,0].\n\nPutting this together, the output would be:\n\n[5,5,5,3,0]\n[5,3,0,0,0]\n[5,3,3,5,0]\n[5,5,5,3,0]\n[3,3,3,0,0]\n\nBut looking at the training examples, the outputs often have the same number repeated in groups, which this does. However, the test input's first row ends with a 0, and the third row ends with a 0. This matches the structure seen in example 1.\n\nHowever, this doesn't match the training example 0's output, but perhaps the pattern varies based on the input's group structure.\n\nGiven the time I've invested and the need to provide an answer, I'll proceed with this pattern for the test input.",

        "cot_2": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. So, we have these input matrices and their corresponding outputs. Let me start by looking at the examples one by one.\n\nStarting with Example 0. The input is a 3x3 matrix:\n\n[4,5,4]\n[5,5,5]\n[4,5,4]\n\nAnd the output is:\n\n[0,4,0]\n[4,4,4]\n[0,4,0]\n\nHmm. Let's compare each position. The 4s in the corners of the input become 0s in the output. The center 5s in the middle row are now 4s. Wait, maybe the output is taking the minimum or maximum of neighboring cells? Or perhaps replacing certain elements based on their value relative to their neighbors.\n\nWait, let's look at the input numbers. The input has 4 and 5. The output has 0 and 4. So maybe when a number is surrounded by higher numbers, it gets replaced by 0, but when it's part of a group of the same numbers, it's kept? Or perhaps it's about the minimum value in the matrix. Wait, the input in example 0 has 4 and 5, the output uses 4. Maybe the 0s are for the positions where the original number is not the minimum in their row or column. Or maybe it's something else.\n\nLet me check Example 1. The input is a 5x5 matrix with 5,6, etc. The output is a matrix with 6 and 0s. Wait, in example 1's output, the 0s are in positions where the input was 6, but perhaps not. Wait, the first input row is [5,5,6,6,6], and the output is [6,6,0,0,0]. So the first two elements in the output are 6, which were 5 in the input. That doesn't make sense. Wait, maybe there's a shift happening here. Let me think differently.\n\nAnother approach: perhaps each cell in the output is determined by comparing its value to its immediate neighbors. For example, if a cell is a local maximum or minimum. Let's check example 0. The input cell (0,0) is 4. Its neighbors are (0,1)=5 and (1,0)=5. So maybe if a cell is a local minimum, it stays, otherwise replaced by 0. Wait, in example 0's output, the 4s in the corners (originally 4) are 0. Wait, that's the opposite. So maybe if the cell is a local maximum, it's replaced by 0? Or perhaps the output is based on the surrounding cells. Let me check the output.\n\nWait, in example 0, the original 4s are at the corners and some positions. The output replaces those corners with 0, but the middle row's 5s become 4s. Hmm. That's confusing. Maybe it's the difference between the cell's value and the surrounding cells. Like, if the cell's value is higher than all adjacent cells, it's set to 0, otherwise it's kept. Wait, but in example 0, the middle 5s are surrounded by 4s and 5s. So maybe they are not higher than all, so they stay. Wait, but the output changes them to 4. That doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the minimum value of the cell and its neighbors. For example, in example 0's middle row, the original 5s become 4. The surrounding cells for the middle cell (1,1) would be 4s and 5s. The minimum of 5 and its neighbors (which are 4s and 5s) is 4. So perhaps each cell is replaced by the minimum value among itself and its adjacent neighbors. Let's test this.\n\nIn example 0, cell (0,1) is 5. Its neighbors are 4 (above), 5 (left), 5 (right), and 5 (below). The minimum among these is 4. So in output, it's 4. That matches. The cell (1,0) is 5. Neighbors: 4 (above), 5 (right), 4 (below). Min is 4. Output is 4. Similarly, middle cell (1,1) is 5. All neighbors are 5s except maybe the corners. Wait, wait, the neighbors for (1,1) would be up (5), down (5), left (5), right (5). So the min is 5. But in output, it's 4. Hmm, that doesn't fit. So maybe that's not the pattern.\n\nWait, maybe the output is taking the cell's value and subtracting some value based on neighboring cells. Alternatively, perhaps it's about the frequency of the numbers. Like, the most frequent number becomes 0, or the least frequent. In example 0, input has 4 and 5. Output uses 4 and 0. Maybe 5 is replaced by 4 (since 4 is the min), and 4 is replaced by 0. But in example 0's input, the corners are 4, which become 0. The middle 5s become 4. So maybe replace each cell with the minimum value in the entire matrix, but only if the cell is part of a group. Wait, the entire matrix's min is 4. So maybe cells that are equal to the min (4) in the input are set to 0, and cells equal to the max (5) are set to the min value (4). But in example 1, the input has 5 and 6. The output uses 6 and 0. The min in example 1's input is 5, max is 6. So in output, 5s become 6 and 6s become 0? Wait, looking at example 1's input first row: [5,5,6,6,6]. Output is [6,6,0,0,0]. So the 5s in input become 6, and 6s become 0. That would fit if the min is 5, max is 6. So replace each occurrence of min (5) with max (6), and max (6) with 0. Then, in example 0, min is 4, max is 5. So replace 4 with 5 and 5 with 0? But in example 0's output, the 5s become 4. Hmm, that's conflicting. So maybe not exactly that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output replaces each occurrence of the maximum value in the matrix with 0, and other values are replaced by the maximum. Wait, in example 0, the max is 5. So replacing 5 with 0 and 4 with 5? But the output for example 0 has 4s. Hmm, that doesn't fit.\n\nWait, let's check example 1's input. The matrix has values 5 and 6. The output uses 6 and 0. The input's max is 6. So perhaps in the output, 6 becomes 0, and 5 becomes 6. But that's exactly what's happening in example 1. The input's 5 becomes 6, and 6 becomes 0. But in example 0, input max is 5. Then according to this pattern, 5 would become 0 and 4 (the other number) becomes 5. But in example 0's output, the 5s in the input are replaced by 4. So that doesn't match. So maybe this is not the right approach.\n\nWait, let's look at example 2. Input has 9,5. Output has 0 and 9. The input's first row is [9,5,9,9,9]. Output is [0,9,0,0,0]. So the 9s in input become 0 except the second position which was 5, now 9. So perhaps the 5s are replaced by 9 and 9s become 0. But why? The min in example 2 is 5, max is 9. So maybe replacing min (5) with max (9), and max (9) with 0. That would fit. Let's check:\n\nExample 0's input has 4 and 5. Min is 4, max is5. So replace 4 with 5 (max) and 5 with 0. But in example 0's output, the 5s in input become 4. Wait, that's conflicting. So maybe the opposite: replace max with 0 and min with max. Wait, example 0's input max is 5, min is 4. Replace 5 with 0, and 4 with 5. But in example 0's output, the 5s in input are replaced by 4. So that doesn't fit. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's about the parity of the numbers. But example 0's input has 4 and 5 (even and odd), output has 0 and 4 (even and even). Not sure.\n\nLet me think differently. Looking at the outputs, in each example, the output seems to have 0s and a certain value. For instance, example 0's output uses 4, example 1 uses 6, example 2 uses 9. These are the maximum values in their respective input matrices. Wait, example 0's input max is 5, but output uses 4. Hmm, that contradicts. So maybe not the max. Wait, example 0's input has 4 and 5. The output uses 4 and 0. So the 4 in the output is the min of the input. Example 1's input has 5 and 6, output uses 6 (the max) and 0. Example 2's input has 5 and 9, output uses 9 (max) and 0. So perhaps the pattern is: for each cell in the input, if the cell is equal to the maximum value in the entire input matrix, replace it with 0. Otherwise, replace it with the maximum value. Wait, let's test this.\n\nExample 0's input has max 5. So cells with 5 (max) become 0, and others (4) become 5? But the output in example 0 has 4s. So that's not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the other way: replace the min value with the max, and the max with 0. Let's see:\n\nExample 0's input min is 4, max is5. So replace 4 (min) with 5 (max) and 5 (max) with 0. Then output would have 5 where input had 4, and 0 where input had5. But example 0's output has 4s where input had5 and 0s where input had4. So the opposite. That doesn't fit.\n\nWait, maybe the output uses the min value of the input. Example 0's min is4. So in the output, the 0s are for max, and the min is kept. So cells with input value equal to the min (4) become 0, and cells equal to max (5) become min (4). Then in example 0, the 4s become 0, and 5s become4. Which matches the output. Let's check:\n\nExample0's input:\n\nOriginal 4s become 0 (correct). 5s become4 (correct). Yes. \n\nExample1's input has min5, max6. So 5s become6 (the min?), no. Wait, according to this idea, the max is6. So cells with value6 (max) become0, and cells with5 (min) become6. Let's check example1's output. Input first row is [5,5,6,6,6]. Output is [6,6,0,0,0]. So 5s become6, 6s become0. Which matches. Yes.\n\nExample2's input has min5, max9. So 5s become9, 9s become0. Input's first row is [9,5,9,9,9]. Output first row is [0,9,0,0,0]. So 9s become0, 5 becomes9. Correct. That fits.\n\nSo the pattern seems to be:\n\n- For each cell in the input matrix, if the cell's value is the maximum value in the entire matrix, replace it with 0. Otherwise, replace it with the maximum value of the matrix.\n\nWait, no. Wait in example0, the max is5, so any cell that is 5 becomes0, and others (4) become5. But in the output, example0's cells are 4 and 0. So that's conflicting. Wait, maybe the other way around: replace the min with max and max with 0.\n\nWait, example0: min is4, max is5. So cells with4 (min) are replaced with5 (max), and cells with5 (max) are replaced with0. Then input 4 becomes5, 5 becomes0. But the output in example0 is 4s and 0s. So that's not matching. So that can't be.\n\nWait, perhaps the output is replacing the maximum value with 0 and the minimum value with the maximum value. Let's see:\n\nExample0: min4, max5. So replace min (4) with max (5), and max (5) with0. Then input 4 becomes5, input5 becomes0. So output would be:\n\nOriginal input row [4,5,4] would become [5,0,5]. But the actual output is [0,4,0]. That doesn't match.\n\nHmm, this is confusing. Let me look again.\n\nLooking at example1's output: the input 5s become6, and 6s become0. The max of the input is6. So when the cell is5 (non-max), it's replaced with max (6). When it's6 (max), replaced with0. So the rule is: for each cell, if it's the maximum value in the matrix, set to0; otherwise, set to the maximum value.\n\nYes, that seems to fit all examples. Let's check.\n\nExample0: input matrix has max5. So cells that are5 become0. Other cells (4) become5. Wait but the output has 4s. That's a problem. Wait example0's output is [0,4,0], etc. So according to that, the 5s become0, and 4s become5. But in the output, the 4s become0. So that's not matching. So this pattern doesn't fit example0.\n\nWait, but this works for example1 and example2. Hmm. There's a contradiction here. So perhaps the pattern is different. Let me re-examine example0.\n\nExample0 input:\n\n[4,5,4]\n[5,5,5]\n[4,5,4]\n\nOutput:\n\n[0,4,0]\n[4,4,4]\n[0,4,0]\n\nSo the input's 4s in the corners and middle edges become0. The 5s become4. So the 4s in the input are being turned into0, and 5s into4. Wait, but according to the previous idea, the 5 is the max. So max becomes0, others become max. But here, the 5s (max) are becoming4. So that doesn't fit. Unless there's another aspect here.\n\nWait, maybe the pattern is that each cell is replaced by the minimum value in its row and column. Or maybe something else.\n\nAnother angle: looking at the structure of the output matrices. In example0, the output has a cross of 4s. Maybe it's highlighting certain positions based on their neighbors. Or maybe it's a rotation or some transformation. But the outputs in the examples don't seem to be geometric transformations.\n\nAlternatively, the output could be based on the count of the cell's value. For instance, in example0, 5 occurs more times than4, but not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is a shift. For example, in example1's input, each row is shifted, and the 6s are shifted, but the outputs show a pattern where the 6s are moving in a diagonal.\n\nWait, looking at example1's output:\n\n[6,6,0,0,0]\n[0,6,6,0,0]\n[0,0,6,6,0]\n[0,0,0,6,6]\n[6,0,0,0,6]\n\nThis looks like a diagonal pattern of 6s. Similarly, example0's output is a cross. Example2's output has certain 9s in a pattern.\n\nWait, perhaps the output is creating a kind of diagonal or cross pattern where the non-zero values are the maximum of the input. But how does that relate to the input?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the input matrix rotated or transformed in some way. But the numbers don't align with rotation. For example, in example0's input, the middle row is all 5s, and the output's middle row is all 4s. So rotation doesn't explain that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is a convolution. For example, each cell is the sum or difference of its neighbors. But I'm not sure.\n\nWait, let's think about the numbers. In example0, input has 4 and5. Output has 4 and0. So 5 becomes4 and4 becomes0. So 5-1=4, 4-4=0. Not obvious.\n\nIn example1, input5 becomes6, 6 becomes0. 5+1=6, 6-6=0.\n\nExample2, input5 becomes9,9 becomes0. 5+4=9,9-9=0.\n\nSo the pattern here is: for each cell, if the value is the minimum in the matrix, add (max - min) to it, else subtract max from it (or set to 0). Let's see:\n\nExample0: min4, max5. So max - min =1. So for cells with value4 (min), 4 +1=5. But in the output, the cells that were4 are0. That doesn't fit. So this can't be.\n\nAlternatively, for each cell, if it's the minimum, replace with max. If it's the max, replace with0. So:\n\nExample0: min4, max5. So 4\u21925, 5\u21920. So input [4,5,4] would become [5,0,5]. But the output is [0,4,0]. Doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. So this approach isn't working.\n\nLet me try to find a pattern that fits all examples. Let's list what happens to each value in the input:\n\nExample0:\n- Input 4 \u2192 output 0 (in corners)\n- Input5 \u2192 output4 (middle row)\nWait, this is inconsistent. So in example0, 4 becomes0 and5 becomes4. So subtract 1 from 5 to get4, subtract4 from4 to get0. No.\n\nExample1:\n- Input5 \u21926 (output)\n- Input6\u21920.\nSo 5 is increased by1,6 is set to0.\n\nExample2:\n- Input5\u21929 (output)\n- Input9\u21920.\nSo 5 increased by4,9 set to0.\n\nWait, the increase for the non-max values seems to be (max value of the input). Let's see:\n\nIn example0, the max is5. So input4 (which is not max) is replaced with0. That doesn't fit. Wait, but in example0, the 4 is replaced with0, which is not an increase. So that idea is not correct.\n\nAlternative approach: perhaps each cell is replaced by the difference between the maximum value of the matrix and the cell's value, but only if it's a certain condition.\n\nIn example0, max is5. So 5-5=0 (so cells with5 become0), and 5-4=1. But output is4, so that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, the output is the cell's value subtracted from the maximum. So for example0, 5-5=0, 5-4=1. Output is0 and4. Not matching.\n\nHmm. Let's think of each example's output in terms of their input's max and min.\n\nExample0:\nInput values:4,5. Output uses4 and0. So perhaps the output is replacing 5 with (max - something). Not sure.\n\nWait, another idea: maybe the output is the maximum value of the input matrix minus the cell's value, but if that's zero, then set to zero. So for example0, max is5. So cell value5 becomes0 (5-5=0), cell value4 becomes1 (5-4=1). But the output has4s and0s. Doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is the cell's value subtracted from the sum of max and min. For example0, sum is4+5=9. 9-5=4 (output 4), 9-4=5. But output is0 and4. Not matching.\n\nWait, maybe the output is (max - min) for the non-min cells. Max - min in example0 is1. So 5-4=1. But output has4s, not1s. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, the output is the cell's value minus the minimum value. So example0: 5-4=1,4-4=0. So output would be 1 and0. But in example0's output, it's4 and0. So that doesn't fit.\n\nThis is getting frustrating. Let's look for another pattern.\n\nLooking at example1's input and output:\n\nInput row0: [5,5,6,6,6] \u2192 output [6,6,0,0,0]\n\nSo each 5 becomes6, each6 becomes0.\n\nExample2's input row0: [9,5,9,9,9] \u2192 output [0,9,0,0,0]\n\nSo each9 becomes0, each5 becomes9.\n\nSo the pattern seems to be that all instances of the minimum value in the input are replaced with the maximum value, and all instances of the maximum are replaced with0. Let's test this:\n\nFor example0:\n\nInput has min4, max5. So replace 4 with5 and 5 with0. But example0's output has0 where there were4 and4 where there were5. So this would be the opposite. So not matching.\n\nBut example1 and2 fit this pattern. For example1:\n\nInput min5, max6. Replace5\u21926, 6\u21920. Which matches the output.\n\nExample2:\n\nInput min5, max9. Replace5\u21929, 9\u21920. Which matches.\n\nBut example0 doesn't fit. So why?\n\nWait, example0's input has min4 and max5. According to this pattern, 4\u21925 and5\u21920. So the input rows would become:\n\n[5,0,5]\n[0,0,0]\n[5,0,5]\n\nBut the actual output is:\n\n[0,4,0]\n[4,4,4]\n[0,4,0]\n\nSo this is not matching. So this pattern works for examples1 and2, but not for example0.\n\nSo what's different in example0? Maybe example0's matrix is symmetric in a certain way, or the min and max are not the only values. Wait, example0's matrix has only two values:4 and5. The other examples have two values as well. So why the discrepancy in example0?\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's an error in my understanding, but how?\n\nWait, perhaps the pattern is that the min value is replaced with the max, and the max value is replaced with the previous min. Let's test:\n\nExample0: min4, max5. So 4\u21925, 5\u21924. Then input:\n\nOriginal rows:\n\n4 5 4 \u21925 4 5\n\n5 5 5 \u21924 4 4\n\n4 5 4 \u21925 4 5\n\nBut the output is:\n\n0 4 0\n\n4 4 4\n\n0 4 0\n\nSo this would not match. But if the output is 4 where there was5 and0 where there was4, that would require swapping 4 and5 and then doing something else. This doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. Another angle: looking at the outputs, the non-zero values are the maximum values of the input matrix in examples1 and2, but in example0, the non-zero value is4, which is the min of the input. Wait, that's conflicting. So example0 uses the min as the non-zero value in the output, while the others use the max. So maybe the pattern is different.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is based on the number of times a value appears. For example, the least frequent value becomes the other value, and the most frequent becomes0. But in example0, 4 appears 4 times, 5 appears 5 times. So 5 is more frequent. If we replace most frequent (5) with0, and least frequent (4) with5. But output has4s and0s. Doesn't fit.\n\nThis is really puzzling. Let's think of the output as a kind of \"shift\" where each cell is replaced by its neighbor. For example, shifting right or left. Let's see example0's output: the middle row is all4s, which matches the input's middle row being all5s. But how does that become4s?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each cell is replaced by the value of the cell that is in the position one to the left (or right) in the same row, but wrapped around. For example, example0's first row input is [4,5,4]. Shifting left would give [5,4,4]. Not matching the output [0,4,0]. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, the output could be the difference between the cell and its neighbors. But this is getting too vague.\n\nWait, let's go back to the original idea that works for examples1 and2. The rule there is: replace each occurrence of the min value with the max value, and each occurrence of the max value with0. So for example1:\n\nInput min5, max6. 5\u21926,6\u21920. \n\nExample2: input min5, max9. 5\u21929,9\u21920.\n\nBut example0 would have input min4, max5. 4\u21925,5\u21920. So output would be:\n\nOriginal input rows:\n\n[4,5,4] \u2192 [5,0,5]\n\n[5,5,5] \u2192 [0,0,0]\n\n[4,5,4] \u2192 [5,0,5]\n\nBut the actual output for example0 is:\n\n[0,4,0]\n\n[4,4,4]\n\n[0,4,0]\n\nThis doesn't match. So why is this pattern not working for example0?\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a different rule for even and odd dimensions. Example0 is 3x3 (odd), others are 5x5 (odd as well). So that's not the case.\n\nAnother possibility: perhaps the pattern involves the sum of the cell's value and some positional factor. Like row index + column index. But this seems unlikely.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is based on the cell's value being part of a certain structure, like a cross or diagonal. For example, in example0's output, the 4s form a cross. The input's 5s form a cross plus the middle row. So maybe in the output, the positions that were part of a cross are replaced with the min value, and others are0. But how does that explain example0's output.\n\nAlternatively, the output is the input matrix where the maximum values are replaced with0 and the minimum values are shifted to neighboring positions. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is a transformation where each cell is replaced by the minimum value of the matrix if the cell was the maximum, and the maximum value if the cell was the minimum. But again, example0's output doesn't fit.\n\nWait, example0's output has 4s where the input had5s and0s where the input had4s. So 4 is the min. So perhaps the rule is: if a cell's value is the maximum, replace it with the min. If it's the min, replace it with0. So:\n\nIn example0:\n\n5 (max) \u21924 (min)\n\n4 (min) \u21920\n\nWhich matches the output.\n\nExample1: input5 (min) \u21920, 6 (max)\u21925 (min)? But example1's output has 6s and0s. So if the max is6, replacing max with min (5) would give5, but example1's output has6s. So this doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. So this works for example0 but not others.\n\nAlternatively, the opposite: max becomes0, min becomesmax. So example0's 5\u21920,4\u21925. But output has4, so that's not matching.\n\nWait, example0's output has4s. Where did that come from? The input's 5s become4. So maybe there's a shift in values. For example, each value is replaced by the previous value minus1. So 5\u21924,4\u21923. But output has0, not3. So that's not it.\n\nAlternatively, the output uses the max value minus1. Example0's max is5, so 5-1=4. So 5s become4, and4s become0 (5-1-4=0? Not sure).\n\nIn example1, max6, so6-1=5. But output uses6. So that's not matching.\n\nAlternatively, max value is replaced by (max - min), and min becomes0. Example0: max5, min4. 5-4=1. So 5\u21921,4\u21920. But output has4 and0. Doesn't fit.\n\nThis is really challenging. Let me try to find another angle.\n\nLooking at example0's output:\n\nOriginal input had 4 and5. Output has 4 and0. So the 4 in the output is the min of the input, and0 is perhaps the max minus min (5-4=1, but not sure).\n\nExample1's output has6 and0. Max is6, min5. 6-5=1. Not sure.\n\nExample2's output has9 and0. Max9, min5. 9-5=4. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the output is the cell's value minus the min value. So example0:\n\n4-4=0, 5-4=1. But output has0 and4. Doesn't fit.\n\nExample1:5-5=0,6-5=1. Output has0 and6. Doesn't fit.\n\nHmm.\n\nWait, another idea: the output is a binary matrix where cells with the max value are 0 and cells with the second highest value are set to the max value. But example0's input has only two values. So in example0, the second highest is4. But output uses4 and0. So max5 becomes0, and4 remains4. Which matches example0. Example1's input has5 and6. So6 is max,5 is second. So5 becomes6,6 becomes0. Which matches example1. Example2's input has5 and9. So9 becomes0,5 becomes9. Which matches example2. Oh! This seems to fit all examples.\n\nLet me verify:\n\nExample0:\n\n- Input values:4 and5 (max5, second highest4).\n\n- Replace max5 with0.\n\n- Replace second highest4 with4 (but in the output, the 4s are present where there were5s in the input. Wait, no.\n\nWait, in example0's input, the output's 4s are where the input had5s, and the 0s are where the input had4s. So according to this idea, the max (5) is replaced with0. The second highest (4) is replaced with max (5)? No, that doesn't fit.\n\nWait, the output in example0 has 4s where input had5s. So perhaps, replace the max with the second highest value. And replace the second highest value with0.\n\nSo for example0:\n\n- 5 (max) \u21924 (second highest)\n\n-4 (second) \u21920\n\nYes! This fits all examples.\n\nExample0:\n\nInput 4\u21920, 5\u21924.\n\nOutput is:\n\n[0,4,0] \u2192 original 4s are now0, 5s now4.\n\nYes.\n\nExample1:\n\nInput values5 and6. Max is6, second highest5.\n\nSo 6\u21925, 5\u21920.\n\nWait, no. But in example1's output, 5 becomes6 and6 becomes0. So according to this new idea, max6 is replaced with5, and second highest5 replaced with0. But example1's output is6 and0. So that doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. This is conflicting again.\n\nAlternative approach: the output replaces each cell that is the maximum value in the matrix with 0. Each cell that is the second highest value is replaced with the maximum. All other cells (if any) are also set to0.\n\nWait, example0's input has two values:4 and5. So the second highest is4. So cells with5 (max) become0. Cells with4 (second highest) become5. So input 4\u21925,5\u21920. Output would be:\n\n[5,0,5]\n\n[0,0,0]\n\n[5,0,5]\n\nBut example0's output is different. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAnother idea: The output is the maximum value in the matrix minus the cell's value, then if that result is greater than zero, it's set to that value, else zero. So:\n\nFor example0: max5.\n\n5-5=0 \u21920.\n\n5-4=1 \u21921.\n\nBut output has0 and4. So no.\n\nAlternatively, the output is the maximum value minus the cell's value multiplied by some factor. Not sure.\n\nLet me try to find a pattern that fits all examples.\n\nExample0:\n\nInput:\n\n4 \u21920\n\n5 \u21924\n\nExample1:\n\n5 \u21926\n\n6 \u21920\n\nExample2:\n\n5 \u21929\n\n9 \u21920\n\nSo for each example, the output for the maximum value is0, and the output for the minimum value is the maximum value. And the other values (if any) are treated somehow.\n\nWait, in example0, the input has only two values. The output is replacing the maximum (5) with0, and the minimum (4) with0. That doesn't fit.\n\nBut wait, the output for example0 has 4s where the input had5s. So the 5s are being replaced with4 (the min), and the4s are being replaced with0.\n\nSo the rule could be:\n\n- For each cell:\n\n   if the value is the maximum in the matrix, replace it with the minimum value.\n\n   if the value is the minimum, replace it with0.\n\nBut in example0:\n\nmax5 \u2192 replace with min4.\n\nmin4 \u2192 replace with0.\n\nSo input 5\u21924,4\u21920. Which matches the output.\n\nExample1:\n\nmax6 \u2192 replace with min5.\n\nmin5 \u2192 replace with0.\n\nBut example1's output has5s replaced with6, which is the max. So this contradicts. So this rule doesn't fit example1.\n\nHmm.\n\nWait, example1's output replaces5 with6, which is the max. So if the rule is to replace min with max and max with0:\n\nExample0:\n\nmin4 \u21920, max5\u21924. So input4\u21920,5\u21924. Which matches.\n\nExample1:\n\nmin5\u21926 (max), max6\u21920. So input5\u21926,6\u21920. Which matches.\n\nExample2:\n\nmin5\u21929 (max), max9\u21920. So input5\u21929,9\u21920. Which matches.\n\nYes! This rule fits all examples.\n\nSo the pattern is:\n\n- For each cell in the input matrix:\n\n   if the cell's value is the minimum value in the entire matrix, replace it with the maximum value of the matrix.\n\n   if the cell's value is the maximum value in the entire matrix, replace it with 0.\n\nSo this explains all the examples.\n\nLet's verify:\n\nExample0:\n\nInput matrix has min4, max5.\n\nSo 4\u21925 (but in the output, the 4s are replaced with0). Wait, no. Wait according to this rule:\n\nNo, wait. The rule states that if the cell is min, replace with max. If it's max, replace with0.\n\nSo in example0:\n\n4 is the min. So replaced with5 (max). 5 is the max. So replaced with0.\n\nBut in example0's output, the 5s are replaced with4, and4s are replaced with0. So this doesn't fit.\n\nWait, this seems to be a contradiction. So what's wrong here?\n\nWait, example0's output has4s where the input had5s and0s where input had4s.\n\nSo according to the rule:\n\nInput5 (max) should become0.\n\nInput4 (min) should become5 (max).\n\nSo the output would have5 where there was4, and0 where there was5.\n\nBut example0's output is:\n\n[0,4,0]\n\n[4,4,4]\n\n[0,4,0]\n\nWhich suggests that the 4s in the output are where the input had5s, and the0s are where the input had4s. So the opposite of the rule.\n\nWait, so perhaps the rule is inverted: replace max with min and min with0.\n\nIn example0:\n\nmax5 \u21924 (min), min4 \u21920.\n\nWhich matches the output.\n\nExample1:\n\nmax6 \u21925 (min), min5\u21920.\n\nBut example1's output has5 replaced with6, and6 replaced with0. Which would mean that the rule is max\u21920, min\u2192max.\n\nWhich is what I initially thought.\n\nSo the rule is:\n\n- Replace the maximum value in the matrix with 0.\n\n- Replace the minimum value in the matrix with the maximum value.\n\n- Any other values (if present) would be handled, but in the examples provided, there are no other values.\n\nSo for example0:\n\n4 is the min, replaced with max (5).\n\n5 is the max, replaced with0.\n\nBut according to the output, the 5s are replaced with4 and4s are replaced with0. So that doesn't fit.\n\nWait, this is getting me more confused.\n\nLet me re-examine the examples:\n\nExample0 input has 4 and5. Output has0 and4.\n\nSo the 4s in the input become0, and5s become4.\n\nSo it's like swapping the min and max, but then replacing max with0.\n\nAlternatively, the output is (max - value) for each cell.\n\nIn example0:\n\nmax5.\n\n5-4=1, 5-5=0.\n\nBut output has4 and0. So no.\n\nAlternatively, (value - min). For example0:\n\n4-4=0,5-4=1. Output has0 and4. Doesn't fit.\n\nWait, example0's output has4 where there were5s. 5-1=4. So maybe subtract 1 from the max, and replace min with0.\n\nBut for example1, max6-1=5, but example1's output uses6. So that's not.\n\nAlternative idea: the output cell is the value of the cell minus the min value, multiplied by (max / min). Not sure.\n\nWait, example0's output 4 is equal to 5-1. 1 is the difference between max and min (5-4=1). So maybe for max cells, replace with max - (max - min) = min. And for min cells, replace with0. So:\n\nIn example0:\n\nmax5 \u21924 (5 - (5-4) =4)\n\nmin4 \u21920\n\nWhich fits.\n\nIn example1:\n\nmax6 \u21926 - (6-5)=5 \u21925\n\nmin5 \u21920\n\nBut example1's output has5 replaced with6 and6 replaced with0. So this doesn't fit.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternatively, the output cell is (max - value) for max values, and (max - value) for min values. Not sure.\n\nWait, example0's output for 5 is4. 5 -1=4. Where does the1 come from? The difference between max and min:5-4=1.\n\nSo 5 - (5-4) =4.\n\nFor4: 4 - (5-4) =3, which is not matching. So no.\n\nExample1:6- (6-5)=5, which would be replacing6 with5, but example1's output replaces6 with0.\n\nThis is not working.\n\nAt this point, I think the correct pattern is that for each cell in the input matrix:\n\n- If the cell's value is the maximum value in the entire matrix, replace it with 0.\n\n- If the cell's value is the minimum value in the entire matrix, replace it with the maximum value.\n\nThis explains all the examples.\n\nLet's test:\n\nExample0:\n\nmax=5, min=4.\n\nSo:\n\n4 \u21925 (max)\n\n5 \u21920\n\nSo input:\n\n[4,5,4] becomes [5,0,5]\n\n[5,5,5] becomes [0,0,0]\n\n[4,5,4] becomes [5,0,5]\n\nBut the actual output is:\n\n[0,4,0]\n\n[4,4,4]\n\n[0,4,0]\n\nThis doesn't match. So this pattern isn't correct.\n\nBut according to the examples, example0's output is different. So what's different in example0?\n\nWait, perhaps I've made a mistake in identifying the min and max.\n\nWait, example0's input is:\n\nRow0:4,5,4\n\nRow1:5,5,5\n\nRow2:4,5,4\n\nSo the min is4, max is5.\n\nBut the output replaces 4 with0 and5 with4.\n\nSo it's the opposite of the pattern.\n\nAh! Maybe the rule is:\n\n- Replace the maximum value with the minimum value.\n\n- Replace the minimum value with0.\n\nYes! Let's test this.\n\nExample0:\n\nmax5 \u21924 (min)\n\nmin4 \u21920.\n\nSo input:\n\n[4,5,4] \u2192 [0,4,0]\n\n[5,5,5] \u2192 [4,4,4]\n\n[4,5,4] \u2192 [0,4,0]\n\nWhich matches the output.\n\nExample1:\n\nmax6 \u21925 (min)\n\nmin5 \u21920.\n\nInput:\n\n[5,5,6,6,6] \u2192 [0,0,5,5,5]\n\nBut example1's output is [6,6,0,0,0]. So this doesn't fit. So this pattern doesn't work for example1.\n\nHmm. This is confusing.\n\nWait, in example1's output, the 5s are replaced with6 and6s replaced with0. So:\n\nmax6 \u21920.\n\nmin5 \u21926.\n\nWhich is the reverse of the previous idea. So the pattern is:\n\n- Replace max with0.\n\n- Replace min with max.\n\nYes! Let's test:\n\nExample0:\n\nmax5 \u21920.\n\nmin4 \u21925.\n\nSo input:\n\n4\u21925,5\u21920.\n\nSo input rows:\n\n[4,5,4] \u2192 [5,0,5]\n\n[5,5,5] \u2192 [0,0,0]\n\n[4,5,4] \u2192 [5,0,5]\n\nBut example0's output is:\n\n[0,4,0]\n\n[4,4,4]\n\n[0,4,0]\n\nWhich doesn't match. So this pattern doesn't fit example0.\n\nExample1:\n\nmax6 \u21920.\n\nmin5 \u21926.\n\nSo input5\u21926,6\u21920.\n\nWhich fits example1's output.\n\nExample2:\n\nmax9\u21920.\n\nmin5\u21929.\n\nWhich fits example2's output.\n\nBut example0 is a problem. So what's different about example0? Let's look at example0's output again.\n\nExample0's output has4s where input had5s and0s where input had4s. So it's the opposite of what this pattern would suggest. So why?\n\nWait, perhaps there's a mistake in the way I'm perceiving the values. Maybe in example0, the roles of max and min are reversed.\n\nNo, example0's max is5, min is4.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the pattern is to replace the min with0 and max with min.\n\nExample0:\n\nmax5 \u21924.\n\nmin4\u21920.\n\nWhich would give the output seen in example0.\n\nExample1:\n\nmax6\u21925.\n\nmin5\u21920.\n\nSo input5 becomes0,6 becomes5. But example1's output is6 and0. So this doesn't fit.\n\nExample2:\n\nmax9\u21925.\n\nmin5\u21920.\n\nBut example2's output has9 and0, which would require the opposite.\n\nSo this pattern only fits example0.\n\nSo there's a contradiction here. How to resolve this?\n\nMaybe the correct pattern is that the output is the input matrix where each occurrence of the second smallest value is replaced with the smallest value, and the smallest value is replaced with0. But example0 has only two values. So the second smallest is5. But in example0's output,5s are replaced with4, which is the smallest. And4s are replaced with0. Which fits.\n\nBut in example1, the second smallest is6 (since min is5, then next is6). So 6 is replaced with5, and5 is replaced with0. But example1's output replaces5 with6 and6 with0. So this doesn't fit.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the pattern is:\n\n- Replace each cell with the value of the cell that is the same as the cell's value in the input, but in the output, the second highest value becomes the highest, and the highest becomes0.\n\nBut example0 has two values, so the highest becomes0, and the second highest (which is the same as the min) becomes the highest. Which fits.\n\nExample0's output:5 (max) becomes0, and4 (min) becomes4. No, wait the output has4s, which is the same as the min. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAt this point, after extensive analysis, I think the correct pattern is:\n\nReplace each occurrence of the minimum value in the matrix with 0.\n\nReplace each occurrence of the maximum value in the matrix with the minimum value.\n\nWait, example0:\n\nmax5\u21924 (min), min4\u21920.\n\nYes, input4 becomes0, 5 becomes4. Which matches example0's output.\n\nExample1:\n\nmax6\u21925 (min), min5\u21920.\n\n input5\u21920,6\u21925. But example1's output has5 replaced with6 and6 replaced with0. So this is the opposite.\n\nSo this pattern only fits example0.\n\nAlternatively, the opposite:\n\nReplace each occurrence of the minimum value with the maximum value.\n\nReplace each occurrence of the maximum value with0.\n\nWhich works for example1 and2, but not example0.\n\n example0's input4\u21925, 5\u21920. Output would be:\n\n[5,0,5]\n\n[0,0,0]\n\n[5,0,5]\n\nBut the actual output is:\n\n[0,4,0]\n\n[4,4,4]\n\n[0,4,0]\n\nSo this doesn't fit.\n\nBut why does example0 have a different pattern? Maybe example0's pattern is different, but the examples1 and2 follow the same pattern. But that's unlikely. The problem states that there's a single pattern across all examples.\n\nPerhaps I'm missing something. Let's re-express all examples in terms of their input and output values.\n\nExample0:\n\nInput values:4,5.\n\nOutput values:0,4.\n\nSo input4\u21920,5\u21924.\n\nExample1:\n\nInput values:5,6.\n\nOutput values:0,6.\n\nSo input5\u21926,6\u21920.\n\nExample2:\n\nInput values:5,9.\n\nOutput values:0,9.\n\nSo input5\u21929,9\u21920.\n\nSo the pattern here is that the input's min value is replaced with the max value, and the max value is replaced with0.\n\nYes! So for each example:\n\n- Replace the minimum value in the input matrix with the maximum value.\n\n- Replace the maximum value in the input matrix with0.\n\nThis explains all examples.\n\nExample0:\n\nInput min4 \u2192 replaced with max5 \u21925, but output has4. Wait, no.\n\nWait, example0's output has4s where the input had5s. So this pattern is not working.\n\nBut wait, in example0's input, the min is4, max is5. So according to this pattern:\n\n- Replace4 (min) with5 (max).\n\n- Replace5 (max) with0.\n\nSo input matrix:\n\n[4,5,4] \u2192 [5,0,5]\n\n[5,5,5] \u2192 [0,0,0]\n\n[4,5,4] \u2192 [5,0,5]\n\nBut the actual output is:\n\n[0,4,0]\n\n[4,4,4]\n\n[0,4,0]\n\nSo this does not fit. So why is there a discrepancy?\n\nThis is the crux of the problem. It seems that examples1 and2 follow this pattern, but example0 does not. But the problem states that there's a single pattern. So I must have made a mistake in identifying the pattern.\n\nAlternative approach: let's consider the output for example0. The output has4s and0s. The input's4 becomes0, and5 becomes4. So this is a swap of the values. 4 becomes0,5 becomes4.\n\nSimilarly, example1's input5 becomes6, and6 becomes0.\n\nExample2's input5 becomes9, and9 becomes0.\n\nSo the pattern is: subtract the cell's value from the sum of the min and max values of the matrix.\n\nFor example0:\n\nmin4 + max5 =9.\n\n9 -4 =5 \u2192 but output is0.\n\n9-5=4 \u2192 which matches output's4.\n\nSo cells with5 become4, cells with4 become5. But output has0 and4.\n\nThis doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, the output is the difference between the cell's value and the min.\n\n example0:\n\n5-4=1,4-4=0. Output has0 and4. Not matching.\n\nHmm.\n\nAnother possibility: the output is the value of the cell modulo something. For example, modulo the min or max. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the output is the cell's value divided by the min value. example0:4/4=1,5/4=1.25. Not matching.\n\nThis is really challenging. Given the time I've spent, I think the correct pattern is that each cell is replaced with the maximum value of the matrix if it was the minimum value in the input, and 0 if it was the maximum. This fits examples1 and2, but not example0. However, example0's output seems to be the opposite. Could there be a mistake in the training examples?\n\nBut the user provided the examples, so assuming they are correct.\n\nWait, perhaps example0's output is a typo, but that's unlikely. So the pattern must fit all examples.\n\nWait, what if the pattern is:\n\n- For each cell, if the cell is equal to the minimum value of the matrix, replace it with 0.\n\n- Otherwise, replace it with the maximum value of the matrix.\n\nLet's test:\n\nExample0:\n\nmin4, max5.\n\nCells with4 \u21920.\n\nCells with5 \u21925.\n\nBut output has4s and0s. So no.\n\nExample1:\n\nmin5, max6.\n\nCells with5\u21920.\n\nCells with6\u21926.\n\nOutput would be:\n\n[0,0,6,6,6]\n\n[6,0,0,6,6]\n\n...\n\nBut example1's output has6 and0. So this pattern doesn't fit.\n\nHmm.\n\nAt this point, I think the correct pattern is to replace each cell with the maximum value of the matrix if it is the minimum value, and replace the maximum value with 0. This works for examples1 and2, but not example0. However, example0's output is the opposite, suggesting that the pattern is inverted. But why?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that the maximum and minimum values are swapped, and then the new maximum is set to zero. For example:\n\nIn example0:\n\nOriginal min4 and max5. Swap to make min5 and max4. Then replace the new max (4) with0. So cells with5 (new min) become4, cells with4 (new max) become0. Which matches example0's output.\n\nExample1:\n\nOriginal min5 and max6. Swap to min6 and max5. Replace5 with0. So cells with6 become5, cells with5 become0. But example1's output has6 and0. So this doesn't fit.\n\nThis is getting me nowhere. Given the time I've spent, I'll proceed with the pattern that works for examples1 and2 and see if it applies to the test case.\n\nThe test input is:\n\n[3,3,3,5,3]\n\n[3,5,3,3,3]\n\n[3,5,5,3,5]\n\n[3,3,3,5,3]\n\n[5,5,5,3,3]\n\nThe matrix has values3 and5. So the min is3, max is5.\n\nAccording to the pattern where min is replaced with max and max is replaced with0:\n\nSo each3 becomes5, each5 becomes0.\n\nApplying this to the test input:\n\nOriginal rows:\n\n[3,3,3,5,3] \u2192 [5,5,5,0,5]\n\n[3,5,3,3,3] \u2192 [5,0,5,5,5]\n\n[3,5,5,3,5] \u2192 [5,0,0,5,0]\n\n[3,3,3,5,3] \u2192 [5,5,5,0,5]\n\n[5,5,5,3,3] \u2192 [0,0,0,5,5]\n\nBut this doesn't match the expected structure of the outputs seen in the examples. For instance, the first row in example1's output starts with two non-zero values. The output for the test case according to this pattern would have 5s and 0s. However, looking at the training examples, the non-zero values in the output are the maximum of the input.\n\nBut according to the training examples, example0's output uses the min as the non-zero value. So this is conflicting.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and the need to provide an answer, I'll proceed with the pattern that replaces min with max and max with0, even though example0 doesn't fit, but the test input may follow examples1 and2's pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that each cell is replaced with the maximum value of the matrix if it's the minimum, and replaced with the minimum value if it's the maximum. So:\n\nFor example0:\n\nmin4 \u2192 replaced with max5 \u21925.\n\nmax5 \u2192 replaced with min4 \u21924.\n\nSo input4\u21925,5\u21924. But the output has4s where the input had5s and0s where the input had4s. So this doesn't fit.\n\nBut example1:\n\nmin5\u21926, max6\u21925. Output has6 and0. Doesn't fit.\n\nThis is leading me to believe that the initial pattern of replacing min with max and max with0 is correct, and example0's output is a typo. But since example0 is part of the training data, I must accept that the pattern works for all examples.\n\nGiven that, let's proceed with applying the pattern to the test input.\n\nTest input:\n\nValues3 (min) and5 (max).\n\nReplace3 with5,5 with0.\n\nSo each3 becomes5, each5 becomes0.\n\nThus, the test input's first row [3,3,3,5,3] becomes [5,5,5,0,5].\n\nBut the training examples' outputs have a certain structure. For example, example1's output has 6s in a diagonal pattern.\n\nBut according to this pattern, the test output would be:\n\n[5,5,5,0,5]\n\n[5,0,5,5,5]\n\n[5,0,0,5,0]\n\n[5,5,5,0,5]\n\n[0,0,0,5,5]\n\nBut looking at the training examples, like example1's output, the non-zero values are arranged in a diagonal pattern. So perhaps there's an additional step involving rotating or shifting the values in a particular pattern.\n\nAh! This might be the missing piece. The pattern involves not just replacing the values but also shifting them in a certain way.\n\nFor example, in example1's input, after replacing5 with6 and6 with0, the non-zero values are shifted to form a diagonal pattern. Similarly, in example0's output, the non-zero values form a cross.\n\nSo the pattern is two-fold:\n\n1. Replace each min with max and each max with0.\n\n2. Then shift the non-zero values in a certain pattern.\n\nBut this complicates things. Let's see.\n\nExample0's output has a cross of4s (which were5s in the input). So after replacing5 with0 and4 with5, but the output is0 and4. So this suggests that after replacement, there's another transformation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that after replacing min with max and max with0, the non-zero values are shifted to the left or right in each row.\n\nFor example, in example1's input, after replacement, each row would have5s replaced with6 and6s with0. But the output has6s in a diagonal pattern. So perhaps each row is rotated to the left by its row index.\n\nFor example1's output, row0 is shifted left by0 \u2192 [6,6,0,0,0]\n\nRow1 shifted left by1 \u2192 [0,6,6,0,0]\n\nRow2 shifted left by2 \u2192 [0,0,6,6,0]\n\nRow3 shifted left by3 \u2192 [0,0,0,6,6]\n\nRow4 shifted left by4 \u2192 [6,0,0,0,6]\n\nBut this would require shifting each row by its index modulo the row length. Let's see:\n\nFor row0 in example1's input after replacement:\n\nOriginal input row0:5,5,6,6,6 \u2192 replaced to6,6,0,0,0. Then shifted left by0 positions \u2192 same as original.\n\nRow1 input:6,5,5,6,6 \u2192 replaced to0,6,6,0,0. Shifted left by1:6,6,0,0,0. But example1's row1 output is [0,6,6,0,0]. So this doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. Alternatively, the non-zero values are arranged in a diagonal pattern, which could be achieved by shifting each row by its row index. But this requires more analysis.\n\nBut this adds another layer of complexity to the pattern, which may not be obvious. Given the time constraints, I think the core pattern is the replacement of min with max and max with0, and the shifting is part of the pattern. \n\nFor the test input, after replacement:\n\nEach3 becomes5, each5 becomes0.\n\nTest input becomes:\n\n[5,5,5,0,5]\n\n[5,0,5,5,5]\n\n[5,0,0,5,0]\n\n[5,5,5,0,5]\n\n[0,0,0,5,5]\n\nBut according to the training examples, perhaps each row is shifted in a certain way. Looking at the test input's structure, perhaps the non-zero values are shifted to form a diagonal.\n\nFor example, row0: [5,5,5,0,5] \u2192 shift left by0 \u2192 no change.\n\nRow1: [5,0,5,5,5] \u2192 shift left by1 \u2192 [0,5,5,5,5]. But example1's output has [0,6,6,0,0], which is different.\n\nThis approach is leading me astray.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the initial pattern is correct, and the answer for the test input is the matrix where3 is replaced with5 and5 with0. \n\nThus, the output would be:\n\n[5,5,5,0,5]\n\n[5,0,5,5,5]\n\n[5,0,0,5,0]\n\n[5,5,5,0,5]\n\n[0,0,0,5,5]\n\nBut looking at the training examples, the outputs have a different structure. For example, example1's output has0s at the end of each row. So maybe there's a rotation or shift that I'm missing.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output for the test case is similar to example1's output, with the non-zero values forming a diagonal. Given that the test input's rows are:\n\nRow0:3,3,3,5,3 \u2192 replaced to5,5,5,0,5.\n\nBut the output should have a diagonal pattern. For example, in example1, the output has6s forming a diagonal. So in the test case, the5s would form a diagonal.\n\nSo perhaps each row's non-zero values are shifted to the right by the row index.\n\nFor example:\n\nRow0 (index0): [5,5,5,0,5] \u2192 shift right by0 \u2192 same.\n\nRow1 (index1): [5,0,5,5,5] \u2192 shift right by1 \u2192 [5,5,0,5,5].\n\nRow2 (index2): [5,0,0,5,0] \u2192 shift right by2 \u2192 [5,0,5,0,0].\n\nRow3 (index3): [5,5,5,0,5] \u2192 shift right by3 \u2192 [0,5,5,5,5].\n\nRow4 (index4): [0,0,0,5,5] \u2192 shift right by4 \u2192 [5,0,0,0,0].\n\nBut this doesn't form a diagonal pattern. Alternatively, shifting to the left by row index.\n\nRow0: shift left by0 \u2192 same.\n\nRow1: shift left by1 \u2192 [0,5,5,5,5].\n\nRow2: shift left by2 \u2192 [0,5,0,5,0].\n\nNot sure.\n\nAlternatively, each row is rotated left by the row index. For example:\n\nRow0 (index0): no shift \u2192 [5,5,5,0,5].\n\nRow1 (index1): shift left by1 \u2192 [0,5,5,5,5].\n\nRow2 (index2): shift left by2 \u2192 [5,0,5,0,0].\n\nRow3 (index3): shift left by3 \u2192 [0,5,5,5,5].\n\nRow4 (index4): shift left by4 \u2192 [0,0,0,5,5].\n\nThis doesn't create a diagonal pattern.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the non-zero values are arranged in a diagonal by keeping the first two elements in each row and setting the rest to0. But this is guesswork.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and the need to provide an answer, I'll proceed with the initial pattern and present the transformed test input without any shifting, assuming that the examples have additional formatting I'm not seeing.\n\nThus, the test output would be:\n\n[5,5,5,0,5]\n\n[5,0,5,5,5]\n\n[5,0,0,5,0]\n\n[5,5,5,0,5]\n\n[0,0,0,5,5]\n\nBut comparing this to the training examples, the outputs have a pattern where non-zero values are grouped in certain positions. For example, in example1's output, each row has two non-zero values followed by zeros. \n\nLooking at the test input's transformed matrix, perhaps after replacement, the non-zero values are shifted to create a diagonal pattern. For example, the first row has four5s and one0, but example1's first row has two6s followed by three0s.\n\nThis suggests that after the replacement, there's a secondary pattern of truncating or shifting the values to form a specific structure. However, without clear rules, this is challenging.\n\nGiven the time I've invested and the need to submit an answer, I'll proceed with the replacement pattern (min to max, max to0) and structure the test output accordingly."
