        "cot_1": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. So, looking at the training examples, all the inputs are lists of zeros except for the last element which has a 1 followed by zeros. The outputs are these lists transformed into sequences of 8s and 1s. Let's see each example in detail.\n\nStarting with Example 0. The input is ten rows of [0,0] except the last one which is [1,0]. The output has alternating [8,1] and [1,8]. Wait, except the first output is [8,1], then [1,8], and repeats. But there are 10 outputs here. Let me count. The first output is [8,1], then [1,8], and this alternates. So rows 0, 2,4,6,8 are [8,1], and 1,3,5,7,9 are [1,8]. But wait, the last input row (the one with the 1) becomes [1,8] in the output. Hmm.\n\nIn Example 1, the input is 3-element lists. The output for the first example (3 elements) starts with [8,1,8], then [1,8,8], etc. Looking at the outputs, it seems like there's a shifting pattern. For the 3-element case, the 1 and 8 are moving positions. Let's see: the first output row is [8,1,8], the next is [1,8,8], then [8,1,8], then [8,8,1], then back to [8,1,8], and so on. Wait, maybe it's rotating the position of 1 each time. For example, in the 3-element case, the 1 moves from position 1 to 0, then to 2, etc. But not exactly. Let's see the rows:\n\nOutput rows for Example1:\n\nRow0: [8,1,8]\nRow1: [1,8,8]\nRow2: [8,1,8]\nRow3: [8,8,1]\nRow4: [8,1,8]\nRow5: [1,8,8]\nRow6: [8,1,8]\nRow7: [8,8,1]\nRow8: [8,1,8]\nRow9: [1,8,8]\n\nSo the 1 is moving positions. Row0 has 1 at index1, row1 at 0, row3 at 2. Then it cycles. Maybe there's a pattern where each row shifts the position of the 1 in a certain way, perhaps every two rows? Or maybe the 1 is moving backward or forward each time.\n\nWait, in Example0, which is 2-element, the 1 alternates between position 0 and 1. For example, row0 output is [8,1], then row1 [1,8], row2 [8,1], etc. Except that the last input row (which was the 1 in input) becomes [1,8]. So the 1 in the input's last row is transformed into a [1,8], which for the 2-element case, seems like the 1 is placed in the first position, and the rest 8s. Wait, no, the input's last row is [1,0], which becomes [1,8] in the output. So the 0s are turned into 8s, and the 1 remains. But the position of the 1 in the output seems to be related to its position in the input. The input's 1 is in position 0, so in the output, it's at position 0, but the other elements are 8s. But wait, the outputs alternate between [8,1] and [1,8] for the 2-element case. But why?\n\nWait, maybe the key is that each row in the output is a shifted version of the previous, with the 1 moving through positions. For the 2-element case, it alternates. For the 3-element, the 1 moves in a cycle: 1,0,2, etc. But how?\n\nAnother angle: All the input rows except the last are all zeros. The last row has a 1 followed by zeros. The output transforms each row into a pattern where 1 moves through different positions, perhaps in a cyclic manner. But how does the number of elements (n) affect the pattern?\n\nLooking at the 4-element example (Example2). The outputs start with [8,8,8,1], then [8,8,1,8], then [8,1,8,8], then [1,8,8,8], and then repeats. So the 1 is moving from the last position to the third, then second, then first, and then back. So for n=4, it's a cycle where the 1 moves left by one each step, and after reaching the first position, it wraps around. But the pattern here in the outputs for example2 is that each consecutive row shifts the 1 to the left. Let's check:\n\nRow0: [8,8,8,1] \u2192 1 at position3\n\nRow1: [8,8,1,8] \u2192 position2\n\nRow2: [8,1,8,8] \u2192 position1\n\nRow3: [1,8,8,8] \u2192 position0\n\nRow4: [8,1,8,8] \u2192 position1 again\n\nRow5: [8,8,1,8] \u2192 position2\n\nRow6: [8,8,8,1] \u2192 position3\n\nRow7: [8,8,1,8] \u2192 position2\n\nRow8: [8,1,8,8] \u2192 position1\n\nRow9: [1,8,8,8] \u2192 position0\n\nWait, that's inconsistent. Because after row3 (position0), row4 jumps to position1. So the shifting direction might reverse. So after reaching the first position, the 1 starts moving right again? Let's see:\n\nRow0: 3 \u2192 row1:2 \u2192 row2:1 \u2192 row3:0 \u2192 row4:1 \u2192 row5:2 \u2192 row6:3 \u2192 row7:2 \u2192 row8:1 \u2192 row9:0. Hmm, perhaps it's a cycle that first shifts left until position0, then shifts right back? Like a pendulum. So for n=4, the 1 moves left until it hits the first position, then moves right again. But the output rows for example2 are:\n\nRow0:3, row1:2, row2:1, row3:0, row4:1, row5:2, row6:3, row7:2, row8:1, row9:0. Wait, the pattern here is moving the 1 left until position0, then right to position1, then left again? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the outputs are generated by a rotation. For n=2, it's alternating. For n=3, perhaps the 1 is rotating in a certain pattern. For example, in the 3-element case:\n\nRow0:1 at position1 \u2192 row1:0 \u2192 row2:1 \u2192 row3:2 \u2192 row4:1 \u2192 row5:0 \u2192 row6:1 \u2192 row7:2 \u2192 row8:1 \u2192 row9:0. So it alternates between moving left and right. Maybe it's like a back-and-forth pattern.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 1 is moving in a cycle based on the row index. For example, for each row in the output, the position of the 1 is determined by (row index) mod (n), but in some pattern.\n\nWait, looking at the 2-element example. There are 10 output rows. For 2 elements, the positions alternate between 1 and 0. So row0: [8,1] (1 at index1), row1: [1,8] (index0), row2: index1, etc. But the last input row (which was the original [1,0]) becomes [1,8], which is index0. So perhaps the pattern is that, except for the last row, the 1 cycles through positions. But the last row in the input is transformed to a 1 followed by 8s, but how?\n\nWait, all the input rows except the last are all zeros. The last row has a 1 followed by zeros. But in the output, the 1 is in varying positions. So the transformation is taking each input row (which is all zeros except possibly the last row) and generating a pattern where the 1 moves through different positions. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe each input row is transformed into a new row where the 1's position is determined by some pattern. For example, the first input row (all zeros) becomes a row with 8s and a 1 in a certain position, and this position changes for each row in the output.\n\nBut the input rows are all the same except the last. So perhaps the output rows cycle through different positions of the 1, regardless of the input's content. But why does the input have 10 rows, and the output as well? The input is 10 rows, each transformed into a row in the output.\n\nSo the pattern is that each of the 10 rows in the input is transformed into a row in the output. The output rows have 8s and exactly one 1. The position of the 1 cycles through different positions for each row. The cycle depends on the length of the row (n).\n\nIn the first example (n=2), the positions alternate between 1 and 0. For example:\n\nOutput rows for n=2 (10 rows):\n\n0:1 at position1\n\n1:0\n\n2:1\n\n3:0\n\n4:1\n\n5:0\n\n6:1\n\n7:0\n\n8:1\n\n9:0\n\nSo for even row indices (0-based), position1; odd indices, position0.\n\nBut in the first example's output, the last row (input's last row which is [1,0]) becomes [1,8]. Which is position0. Which is consistent with the pattern. So it's just an alternating pattern.\n\nFor n=3, the output rows have the 1 moving in a different pattern. Let's see the positions for each row:\n\nRow0:1 at position1\n\nRow1:0\n\nRow2:1\n\nRow3:2\n\nRow4:1\n\nRow5:0\n\nRow6:1\n\nRow7:2\n\nRow8:1\n\nRow9:0\n\nSo the pattern for n=3 is 1,0,1,2,1,0,1,2,1,0. So it's moving between 1, 0, 1, 2, etc. Like bouncing between 0 and 2 with 1 in between.\n\nFor n=4, the positions are:\n\nRow0:3\n\nRow1:2\n\nRow2:1\n\nRow3:0\n\nRow4:1\n\nRow5:2\n\nRow6:3\n\nRow7:2\n\nRow8:1\n\nRow9:0\n\nSo it goes 3,2,1,0,1,2,3,2,1,0. So it's a back-and-forth movement. First decrementing from 3 to 0, then incrementing to 3, then decrementing again. But given that there are 10 rows, the pattern repeats every 6 steps? Wait, from 3 to 0 (4 steps), then up to 3 (3 steps) again? Not exactly. Let's see:\n\nThe sequence is 3,2,1,0,1,2,3,2,1,0. So after reaching 0, it moves up to 1, then 2, then 3, then back to 2,1,0. So the cycle is 3-2-1-0-1-2-3-2-1-0, etc. So for n=4, the movement is a sawtooth pattern, moving down to 0, then up to 3, then down again. But how does this fit into the number of rows (10 in this case)?\n\nSo the general pattern seems to be that for each row in the input (which is all zeros except possibly the last one), the output row is a sequence of 8s and a single 1, whose position cycles through a certain pattern based on the length of the row.\n\nNow, the key is to determine the pattern for a given n (length of the row). Let's try to find a formula for the position of the 1 in the output row, given the row index and n.\n\nFor n=2: positions alternate between 1 and 0 for each row. So for row i (0-based), position is (i mod 2) == 0 \u2192 1, else 0.\n\nWait, no. For n=2, the positions are:\n\nRow 0 \u2192 1\n\nRow1 \u21920\n\nRow2 \u21921\n\nRow3 \u21920\n\n...\n\nSo for even row indices, position1; odd indices, position0. So formula: 1 - (i mod 2).\n\nFor n=3, the positions are 1,0,1,2,1,0,1,2,1,0. So the pattern is: 1,0,1,2, repeating every 3 rows. Let's check:\n\ni=0 \u21921\n\ni=1\u21920\n\ni=2\u21921\n\ni=3\u21922\n\ni=4\u21921\n\ni=5\u21920\n\ni=6\u21921\n\ni=7\u21922\n\ni=8\u21921\n\ni=9\u21920\n\nSo the pattern is 0\u21921, 1\u21920, 2\u21921, 3\u21922, 4\u21921, 5\u21920, etc. It seems like for n=3, the position cycles through a sequence that moves down to 0, up to 2, then repeats. Perhaps the formula is (i mod 4) mapped as 0\u21921, 1\u21920, 2\u21921, 3\u21922, then repeat. But i mod 4 would cycle every 4 steps. Let's see:\n\ni=0: 0 mod 4 =0 \u21921\n\ni=1:1 mod4=1 \u21920\n\ni=2:2 mod4=2 \u21921\n\ni=3:3 mod4=3 \u21922\n\ni=4:4 mod4=0 \u21921\n\ni=5:5 mod4=1 \u21920\n\nYes, that's the pattern. So for n=3, the position is (i mod 4) \u2192 mapped as 0\u21921, 1\u21920, 2\u21921, 3\u21922. So the formula for position when n=3 is ( (i mod 4) // 2 ) * 2 - (i mod 2) ? Hmm, maybe not. Alternatively, for each i, the position is ( (i mod 4) >= 2 ? (i mod4) -2 : 1 - (i mod2) )? Not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the positions cycle in a way that for n=3, the steps are: 1,0,1,2,1,0,1,2, etc. So for even i: 1 if i//2 is even, 1 if i is even? Not sure. Maybe the pattern is generated by moving back and forth between 0 and 2, with 1 in between.\n\nAlternatively, the position for row i and n elements is determined by (n-1) - (i mod (2*(n-1))) //1 ? Wait, perhaps for even and odd n, the pattern varies. Let's see for n=4.\n\nn=4: the positions for i=0 to 9 are 3,2,1,0,1,2,3,2,1,0. So the sequence for n=4 is 3,2,1,0,1,2,3,2,1,0. So it's moving down to 0, then up to 3, then down again. The cycle here is 3,2,1,0,1,2,3,2,1,0, which is a cycle of 8 steps (3,2,1,0,1,2,3,2) then repeats. Wait, but how? Let's see the cycle length. For n=4, the positions go from 3 down to 0 (4 steps), then up to 3 (3 steps), then down again. So total cycle length is 4+3*2? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the cycle length for n elements is 2*(n-1). For example, n=2: 2*(2-1)=2. So cycle length 2. For n=3, 2*(3-1)=4. So cycle length 4. For n=4, 2*(4-1)=6. Let's check:\n\nFor n=4, the positions in the example are 3,2,1,0,1,2,3,2,1,0. So the cycle after 6 steps would be 3,2,1,0,1,2, then repeat. But the given example's positions go 3,2,1,0,1,2,3,2,1,0. So from 3 to 2 to 1 to 0 (steps 0-3), then up to 1,2,3 (steps 4-6?), then down again to 2,1,0 (steps 7-9). Hmm, perhaps the cycle is longer. Maybe the pattern for n is to create a cycle of 2*(n-1) steps where the position moves down to 0, then up to n-1, and repeats.\n\nFor example, for n=4:\n\nCycle length is 2*(4-1) =6. So each cycle has 6 steps. The positions would be 3,2,1,0,1,2 (then repeats 3,2,1,0,1,2). But in the example, after step 3 (position0), step4 is1, step5 is2, step6 is3, which is not part of the 6 steps. Wait, maybe the cycle is 2*(n-1) -1? Not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the pattern is a sawtooth wave that bounces between 0 and (n-1), moving one step each time. For n=4, it would go 3,2,1,0,1,2,3,2,1,0. So starting from 3 (n-1), decrement until 0, then increment until 3, then decrement again. So each cycle is (n-1)*2 steps. For n=4, 3*2=6 steps: 3,2,1,0,1,2. But in the example, we have steps beyond that, so maybe the cycle is actually 2*(n-1) steps. But in the example, the steps continue beyond 6, so maybe the cycle is 2*(n-1) steps, but the example has 10 steps, which is 6 + 4 steps. So for n=4, the cycle would repeat every 6 steps. Let's see:\n\nCycle for n=4 would be:\n\n0:3\n\n1:2\n\n2:1\n\n3:0\n\n4:1\n\n5:2\n\n6:3\n\n7:2\n\n8:1\n\n9:0\n\nSo the cycle is 3,2,1,0,1,2. Then for step6 (i=6), it's 3 again, step7 is 2, etc. So the cycle length is 6 steps, which is 2*(n-1). So for each n, the pattern cycles every 2*(n-1) steps, bouncing between n-1 and 0.\n\nSo the position for row i and n elements is determined by:\n\ncycle_length = 2*(n-1)\n\ncycle_index = i % cycle_length\n\nif cycle_index < (n-1), then position is (n-1) - cycle_index\n\nelse, position is cycle_index - (n-1)\n\nSo for n=4, cycle_length=6.\n\ni=0: cycle_index=0 \u2192 position 3 (4-1 -0=3)\n\ni=1:1 \u21923-1=2\n\ni=2:2 \u21923-2=1\n\ni=3:3 \u21923-3=0\n\ni=4:4 \u21924- (4-1) =4-3=1 (since 4 >=3 (n-1=3), position=4-3=1)\n\ni=5:5 \u21925-3=2\n\ni=6:6%6=0 \u21923\n\ni=7:7%6=1 \u21922\n\ni=8:8%6=2 \u21921\n\ni=9:9%6=3 \u21920\n\nWhich matches the example for n=4. So that's correct.\n\nSimilarly, for n=3, cycle_length=4.\n\ni=0 \u21920 \u21922-0=2? Wait n-1=2. So cycle_index=0 \u2192 position=2-0=2. But in example1, row0 has position1. Hmm, this doesn't fit. Wait, maybe I need to adjust the formula.\n\nWait for example1 (n=3), cycle_length=2*(3-1)=4.\n\nBut according to example1's row0, the position is1. Let's apply the formula.\n\ni=0: cycle_index=0 \u2192 position=(3-1) -0=2? But example1's row0 has position1. So this contradicts. So maybe my formula is incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the formula is different. Let's check for n=3.\n\nn=3, cycle_length=2*(3-1)=4.\n\nFor i=0, cycle_index=0:\n\nif cycle_index < (n-1) \u2192 0 <2 \u2192 yes. position = (n-1) - cycle_index =2-0=2. But example1's row0 has position1. So discrepancy.\n\nWait perhaps the formula should be adjusted. Maybe the cycle starts at position1 for n=3.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the formula is:\n\nFor a given row i and n elements, the position is determined as follows:\n\ncycle_length = 2*(n-1)\n\ncycle_index = i % cycle_length\n\nif cycle_index < (n-1):\n\n    position = (n-1) - cycle_index\n\nelse:\n\n    position = cycle_index - (n-1) +1 \n\nWait, but let's test this for n=3.\n\ncycle_length=4.\n\nFor i=0, cycle_index=0 <2 \u2192 position=2-0=2. But example1's row0 has position1. So that's not correct.\n\nHmm. This suggests that the formula for n=3 is different. Let's see the actual positions for example1:\n\ni | position\n\n0 |1\n\n1 |0\n\n2 |1\n\n3 |2\n\n4 |1\n\n5 |0\n\n6 |1\n\n7 |2\n\n8 |1\n\n9 |0\n\nSo for n=3, the positions are 1,0,1,2,1,0,1,2,1,0.\n\nHmm, the cycle here seems to be 1,0,1,2, repeating every4 steps.\n\nSo for i=0:1, i=1:0, i=2:1, i=3:2, i=4:1, etc.\n\nThis doesn't fit the previous pattern for n=2 and n=4. So perhaps the formula isn't uniform across different n.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the cycle is (n-1)*2 steps, but the starting point varies. For n=2, starting at position1, then 0.\n\nFor n=3, starting at position1, then 0, then 1, then 2, then back to 1,0, etc.\n\nBut why? Maybe the starting position is (n-1) // 2. For n=2, (2-1)//2=0.5 \u2192 0. But the starting position is1. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the starting position is (n-1) if i is even, or something else. This is getting complicated.\n\nAlternatively, think about how the 1 moves through the array. For each row in the output, the 1's position is shifted in a certain direction. For even rows, shift left; for odd rows, shift right. Or some other pattern.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the pattern for each n is that the 1 moves one step to the left each time, wrapping around when it reaches the start. For example, n=2:\n\nPositions would be 1,0,1,0, etc. Which matches example0.\n\nFor n=3, positions would be 2,1,0,2,1,0, etc. But example1's first position is1, not2. So that's not matching.\n\nAlternatively, the 1 starts at position (n-1) for the first row, then moves left each step, wrapping around. For example, n=3: positions 2,1,0,2,1,0, etc. But example1's first row is1. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the first row's position is (n-1) if the input's row has a 1, but since all input rows except the last are zeros, the output's rows are part of a cycle determined by the row index, with the 1 moving through positions regardless of the input's data. But why would the input's last row, which has a 1, become a 1 in a different position? For example, in example0, the input's last row is [1,0], which becomes [1,8] in the output. So the 1 is in the first position, and the other elements are 8s. But according to the pattern for even rows, the output's last row (index9) would be position0. Which aligns with example0's output for row9 being [1,8].\n\nSo regardless of the input's content (all zeros except last row), each output row is generated by a pattern based on the row index and n. The 1 is placed in a specific position determined by i (row index) and n. The input's actual data (zeros and one 1 in the last row) is not directly determining the output's 1 positions, except that perhaps the last row in the input (which has the 1) is treated the same as other rows in the output, following the same pattern.\n\nSo the key is to find, for each row i (0-based) and n elements, the position of the 1 in the output row.\n\nLooking at the examples:\n\nn=2:\n\npositions alternate between1 and0 for each row i.\n\nn=3:\n\npositions follow 1,0,1,2,1,0,1,2,1,0.\n\nn=4:\n\npositions follow3,2,1,0,1,2,3,2,1,0.\n\nSo the pattern for n=2 is a cycle of 2 steps.\n\nFor n=3, a cycle of 4 steps:1,0,1,2.\n\nFor n=4, a cycle of 6 steps:3,2,1,0,1,2, then repeats as3,2,1,0,1,2.\n\nWait, no. For n=4, the cycle is 3,2,1,0,1,2, which is6 steps, but the example has 10 rows. So row6 would be3, row7=2, etc.\n\nSo for each n, the cycle length is 2*(n-1). For n=2, 2*1=2 steps. For n=3, 2*2=4 steps. For n=4, 2*3=6 steps.\n\nThe pattern within each cycle is as follows:\n\n- For the first (n-1) steps, the position decrements from (n-1) to 0.\n\n- For the next (n-1) steps, the position increments from 1 to (n-1).\n\nBut wait, for n=4:\n\nThe first 3 steps (0-2):3\u21922\u21921\u21920.\n\nThen the next3 steps (3-5):1\u21922\u21923.\n\nThen the next steps 6-8:3\u21922\u21921\u21920 again? But in the example, after step5 (position2), step6 is3, step7 is2, etc. So the cycle for n=4 would be 3,2,1,0,1,2,3,2,1,0, etc. But according to the cycle length of 2*(n-1)=6 steps, steps 0-5 are3,2,1,0,1,2. Then steps6-11 would repeat3,2,1,0,1,2. But in the example, step6's position is3, which matches. Step7 is2, step8 is1, step9 is0. Wait, but according to the cycle, steps6-11 would be3,2,1,0,1,2. But in the example, step6 is3, step7 is2, step8 is1, step9 is0. So steps6-9 are3,2,1,0. Which is part of the cycle. So the cycle is indeed 6 steps.\n\nBut in the example for n=4, the positions after the first 6 steps (i=0-5) are:\n\ni=6:3 (cycle_index0 again)\n\ni=7:2 (cycle_index1)\n\ni=8:1 (cycle_index2)\n\ni=9:0 (cycle_index3)\n\nWhich are part of the same cycle (3,2,1,0,1,2).\n\nSo for n=4, i=6's cycle_index is0 (6 mod6=0), so position is3.\n\ni=9:9 mod6=3 \u2192 position0.\n\nSo the formula holds.\n\nNow, for n=3, the cycle length is4 steps. Let's check:\n\ni=0:0 mod4=0 \u2192 position2 (n-1=2).\n\nBut example1's row0 has position1, which contradicts. So something's wrong.\n\nWait, no. For n=3, the cycle length is4 steps. According to the formula, position would be:\n\nfor cycle_index < (n-1) \u2192 0 <2 \u2192 yes, position=2-0=2. But example1's row0 has position1.\n\nSo there's a discrepancy. So the formula works for n=2 and n=4 but not for n=3. So the formula must be different.\n\nWait maybe the formula is:\n\nposition = (n-1) - (i mod (2*(n-1))) if (i mod (2*(n-1))) < (n-1) else (i mod (2*(n-1))) - (n-1)\n\nBut for n=3, this would give:\n\ncycle_length=4.\n\ni=0: 0 mod4=0 <2 \u2192 position=2-0=2. But example1's row0 is1.\n\nSo that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternative approach: Let's see for n=3, the positions are1,0,1,2,1,0,1,2,1,0.\n\nSo the cycle for n=3 is [1,0,1,2], repeating every4 steps. So the positions are:\n\ni mod4 \u2192 position:\n\n0 \u21921\n\n1 \u21920\n\n2 \u21921\n\n3 \u21922\n\n4 \u21921 (4 mod4=0 \u21921)\n\n5 \u21920\n\n6 \u21921\n\n7 \u21922\n\n8 \u21921\n\n9 \u21920.\n\nSo how to derive this from n and i? Maybe the formula for n=3 is different. Perhaps it's based on a different cycle. Like, the cycle starts at position1 for n=3.\n\nAlternatively, the formula for position is:\n\nposition = (n-1 - (i % (2*(n-1))) ) if (i % (2*(n-1))) < (n-1) else (i % (2*(n-1))) - (n-1) +1 \n\nBut I'm not sure. Let's try for n=3:\n\ni=0 \u2192 0%4=0 <2 \u2192 position=2-0=2. Still not matching.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the cycle starts at position1 and decrements, but after reaching 0, increments again. For n=3:\n\ni=0 \u21921\n\ni=1 \u21920\n\ni=2 \u21921\n\ni=3 \u21922\n\ni=4 \u21921\n\ni=5 \u21920\n\netc.\n\nSo the pattern is 1,0,1,2. So for even i (0,2,4,6,8), position is1. For i mod4=1, position0. i mod4=3, position2.\n\nBut how to generalize this for any n.\n\nAlternative idea: The position for row i is determined by the following steps:\n\n- For even values of i, the position is (i//2) mod (n).\n\n- For odd values of i, the position is (n-1) - (i//2) mod (n).\n\nBut let's test this.\n\nFor example0 (n=2):\n\ni=0 (even) \u2192 (0//2) mod2=0 mod2=0 \u2192 position0? But example0's row0 has position1. So that's not right.\n\nHmm. Not sure.\n\nAlternative approach: Let's think of the pattern as a wave that starts from the middle of the array for odd n and from the end for even n.\n\nBut this is getting too vague. Let's try to find a general pattern.\n\nFor n=2:\n\nPositions alternate between1 and0.\n\nFor n=3:\n\nPositions cycle through1,0,1,2.\n\nFor n=4:\n\nPositions cycle through3,2,1,0,1,2.\n\nSo the pattern for each n is:\n\n- The 1 moves left until it reaches position0, then moves right until it reaches position (n-1), then repeats.\n\nBut the number of steps taken to move from (n-1) to0 is (n-1) steps. Then moving back to (n-1) takes (n-2) steps (since it starts at0 and moves to1, 2,...,n-1).\n\nWait, for n=4:\n\nMove from3 to0:3\u21922\u21921\u21920 (3 steps down).\n\nThen move from0 to3:0\u21921\u21922\u21923 (3 steps up).\n\nTotal cycle is6 steps. Which fits the cycle length of6.\n\nSimilarly, for n=3:\n\nMove from1 to0 (1 step down), then to2 (2 steps up). So cycle length is3 steps. But in example1, the cycle is4 steps. So perhaps this approach is not correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe for each n, the cycle length is 2*(n-1), and the position is:\n\nposition = (n-1) - (i mod (n-1)) if i mod (2*(n-1)) < (n-1), else (i mod (n-1)) \n\nBut let's test this for n=3:\n\ncycle_length=2*(3-1)=4.\n\nFor i=0 mod4=0 <2 \u2192 position=2-0=2. But example1's row0 is1. So no.\n\nHmm. This is getting complicated. Maybe I should look for another pattern.\n\nAnother observation: For each example, the first output row has the 1 at position (n-1) if n is even. For n=2 (even), first position is1 (which is n-1=1). For n=4 (even), first position is3 (n-1=3). For n=3 (odd), first position is1. So for even n, first position is (n-1), for odd n, first position is (n//2). For n=3, (3//2)=1. For n=5, (5//2)=2.\n\nSo for the test input, which has n=5, the first position would be4 (since 5 is odd? Wait, n=5 is odd. Wait, no. Wait, n=5 is even or odd? 5 is odd, so (n//2) is2. So first position is2.\n\nBut let's see the examples:\n\nn=2 (even), first position1 (n-1=1).\n\nn=3 (odd), first position1 (n//2=1).\n\nn=4 (even), first position3 (n-1=3).\n\nSo for even n, first position is n-1; for odd n, first position is (n-1)/2.\n\nThen, the pattern alternates between moving left and right. For even n, the first move is left, then right, etc. For odd n, perhaps the movement is different.\n\nAlternatively, the initial position for even n is (n-1), and for odd n is (n-1)/2. Then, each subsequent row's position is determined by moving in a certain direction, alternating every row.\n\nFor example:\n\nn=2 (even):\n\nStart at1 (n-1=1). Next row move left to0. Then back to1, etc.\n\nn=3 (odd):\n\nStart at1 ( (3-1)/2=1). Next row move left to0. Then back to1. Then right to2. Then back to1, etc.\n\nn=4 (even):\n\nStart at3. Next row2, then1, then0, then1, then2, then3, then2, etc.\n\nBut how to generalize this into a formula.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the direction changes each time the 1 reaches the start or end of the array. But this would require tracking the direction for each step, which might complicate the formula.\n\nAlternatively, for even n:\n\nThe pattern is a sawtooth wave, starting at n-1, decrementing to0, then incrementing ton-1, and so on.\n\nFor odd n:\n\nThe pattern starts at (n-1)/2, decrementing to0, then incrementing ton-1, then decrementing to0 again, but this doesn't fit the example for n=3.\n\nAlternatively, for odd n, the pattern is a triangle wave that oscillates between 0 and (n-1), with a step of 1 each time, starting from (n-1)/2.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nGiven the time constraints, perhaps the best approach is to find a general formula that works for all examples and predict the test case.\n\nThe test case is for n=5. The input is 10 rows of5 elements each. The output should follow the pattern observed in the previous examples.\n\nFor n=5, the cycle length would be 2*(5-1)=8 steps. So for each row i (0-9), the position is determined as follows:\n\ncycle_index = i mod8.\n\nif cycle_index <4 (n-1=4), then position=4 - cycle_index.\n\nelse, position= cycle_index -4.\n\nSo for i=0:\n\ncycle_index0 \u2192 position4-0=4.\n\ni=1:4-1=3.\n\ni=2:4-2=2.\n\ni=3:4-3=1.\n\ni=4:4-4=0.\n\ni=5:5-4=1.\n\ni=6:6-4=2.\n\ni=7:7-4=3.\n\ni=8:8 mod8=0 \u21924.\n\ni=9:9 mod8=1 \u21923.\n\nSo the positions for the test case would be:\n\nRow0:4\n\nRow1:3\n\nRow2:2\n\nRow3:1\n\nRow4:0\n\nRow5:1\n\nRow6:2\n\nRow7:3\n\nRow8:4\n\nRow9:3\n\nSo each output row for n=5 would have a single 1 in the position calculated above, and the rest 8s.\n\nSo the output rows would be:\n\nRow0: [8,8,8,8,1]\n\nRow1: [8,8,8,1,8]\n\nRow2: [8,8,1,8,8]\n\nRow3: [8,1,8,8,8]\n\nRow4: [1,8,8,8,8]\n\nRow5: [8,1,8,8,8]\n\nRow6: [8,8,1,8,8]\n\nRow7: [8,8,8,1,8]\n\nRow8: [8,8,8,8,1]\n\nRow9: [8,8,8,1,8]\n\nWhich matches the pattern observed in the training examples. For example, the first few rows would have the 1 moving left to position0, then right again.\n\nThus, applying this pattern to the test input, the output should follow this sequence.",

        "cot_2": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. So, looking at the training examples, all the input rows are mostly zeros, except the last one which has a 1 followed by zeros. The outputs are arrays of 8s and 1s. Let me start by comparing the inputs and outputs for each example.\n\nStarting with Example 0. The input is 10 rows of [0,0], except the last which is [1,0]. The output has alternating [8,1] and [1,8] for the first 9 rows, and then [1,8] again for the last row. Wait, but let's count. The output has 10 rows. The first row is [8,1], then [1,8], alternating each line. The last row (10th) is [1,8]. So maybe it's alternating starting with [8,1], then flipping each subsequent row. But since there are 9 rows before the last, the 9th would be [8,1], and then the 10th is [1,8]. Hmm.\n\nBut maybe there's a different pattern. Let's check the positions of 1 and 8. For the 2-element case (Example 0), the 1 is moving between the two positions. Like in row 1 of output, it's in the second position (index 1), then first position (index 0) next, and so on. So maybe each row alternates the position of 1 and 8, starting from the right, then left, etc. But how does the input's 1 in the last row influence this?\n\nWait, the input's last row has [1,0], and in the output, the last row is [1,8]. So perhaps the position of the 1 in the input's last row (which is the first element here) determines the starting position of a shifting pattern. But in Example 0, the output rows alternate between 8,1 and 1,8. So for the first output row, the 1 is at index 1, then index 0, and so on. But how does the input's 1 in the last row (position 0) affect that?\n\nLooking at Example 1: Input is 3 columns. The last input row is [1,0,0]. The output has sequences like [8,1,8], [1,8,8], [8,1,8], [8,8,1], etc. So the 1 is moving through different positions. Let's track the 1's position in each output row:\n\nRow 0: [8,1,8] \u2192 index 1\nRow 1: [1,8,8] \u2192 index 0\nRow 2: [8,1,8] \u2192 index 1\nRow 3: [8,8,1] \u2192 index 2\nRow 4: [8,1,8] \u2192 index 1\nRow 5: [1,8,8] \u2192 index 0\nRow 6: [8,1,8] \u2192 index 1\nRow 7: [8,8,1] \u2192 index 2\nRow 8: [8,1,8] \u2192 index 1\nRow 9: [1,8,8] \u2192 index 0\n\nSo the 1's position is cycling through a pattern: 1, 0, 1, 2, 1, 0, 1, 2, 1, 0. Wait, that's a pattern where it's moving back and forth between positions, maybe? Like starting at 1, then 0, then 1, then 2 (max index), then back to 1, 0, etc.\n\nSimilarly, in Example 2 with 4 columns. The last input row is [1,0,0,0]. The output starts with [8,8,8,1], then [8,8,1,8], [8,1,8,8], [1,8,8,8], then repeats. So the 1 is moving from the last position (index 3) to index 2, then 1, then 0, then back up. Let's list the positions:\n\nRow 0: 3\nRow1: 2\nRow2:1\nRow3:0\nRow4:1\nRow5:2\nRow6:3\nRow7:2\nRow8:1\nRow9:0\n\nWait, that's a cycle where the 1 moves left to the start (0), then back right to the end (3), then left again? So for 4 elements, it's going 3 \u21922\u21921\u21920\u21921\u21922\u21923\u21922\u21921\u21920? Hmm. So perhaps the pattern is a snake-like movement, moving from the position of the 1 in the input's last row (which is index 0 here for the 4-element case?), wait no. Wait the input's last row in example 2 is [1,0,0,0], so the 1 is at index 0. But the output's first row is [8,8,8,1], which has the 1 at index 3 (the last position). So perhaps the initial position of the 1 in the output is the opposite end of where the input's 1 is located.\n\nWait, in example 0, the input's 1 is at index 0 (since [1,0] in input's last row). The output's first row is [8,1], which has the 1 at index 1. So the opposite position. Then alternates. For example 1, the input's 1 is at index 0 (since [1,0,0] in input's last row). The output's first row is [8,1,8], with 1 at index 1. Then next row has it at 0, then back to 1, then 2, then 1, etc. So maybe the starting position for the 1 in the output is the next position after the input's 1's position, but wrapped around. Like, for input's 1 at position 0 in a 2-element array, the output starts at position 1. For a 3-element array, input's 1 is at 0, output starts at 1. Then for a 4-element array, input's 1 is at 0, output starts at 3? Because in example 2, the first output row's 1 is at index 3. Wait, that's the last position. So maybe the starting position is (n-1) - input_1_position. For example, in example 0: input_1 is at 0 in 2 elements. (2-1) - 0 = 1. So output starts at 1. Then for example 1: 3-1 -0=2? Wait no. Wait, the input is 3 elements, input_1 at 0. So (3-1) -0 = 2. But the first output's 1 is at index 1. Hmm, that doesn't fit. Maybe another approach.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the position of the 1 in the input's last row determines the direction of movement. For example, if the input's 1 is at the first position (like in all examples), then the output's 1 starts at the opposite end and moves in a certain pattern. Let's see:\n\nIn example 0: 2 elements. The 1 in the input is at index 0. The output's first row has 1 at index 1. Then alternates between 0 and 1 each row. So the pattern is starting at the opposite end, then alternating.\n\nIn example 1: 3 elements. Input's 1 is at index 0. Output starts with 1 at index 1. Then moves to 0, then 1, then 2, then 1, 0, etc. So the movement is 1\u21920\u21921\u21922\u21921\u21920\u21921\u21922\u21921\u21920. So it's like moving left, then right, then left again, but each time extending the range? Or maybe it's moving back and forth, increasing the step each time.\n\nWait, in example 1, the positions of 1 in the output rows are: 1,0,1,2,1,0,1,2,1,0. So the pattern seems to go 1,0,1,2,1,0,1,2, etc. So it's like moving left, then right, then left again but increasing the maximum each time? Not sure. Alternatively, maybe the 1 is moving back and forth between the start and end, but each cycle increases the end. Wait, maybe for 3 elements, the positions cycle through 1, 0, 1, 2, 1, 0, etc. So the 1 is moving left once, then right once, then left again, but in a way that covers the positions.\n\nFor example 2 with 4 elements, the positions are: 3,2,1,0,1,2,3,2,1,0. So here, the 1 starts at the end (3), moves left to 0, then back right to 3, then left again. So the pattern is a snake-like movement from end to start, then start to end, etc. But how does this relate to the input's 1 position?\n\nThe input's last row in all training examples has a 1 at the first position (index 0). So maybe the transformation is that for each input row (except the last one), the output is a sequence where the 1 starts at the opposite end of where the input's 1 is (but the input's rows are all zeros except the last one). Wait, but all input rows except the last are zeros. So the transformation might be based on the last input row's 1's position, and then generating a pattern for each output row based on that.\n\nSo the key seems to be the position of the 1 in the last input row, which is always the first element (index 0) in the training examples. Then the output rows have the 1 moving in a certain pattern based on that.\n\nAnother approach: the output seems to be generated by a pattern where the 1 moves in a certain way through the array, and the rest are 8s. The movement could be oscillating between positions, moving left and right. For a 2-element array, it alternates between positions 1 and 0. For 3 elements, the pattern is a bit more complex, and for 4 elements, it's a full cycle from end to start and back.\n\nLooking at the number of rows: each input has 10 rows, and the output also has 10 rows. So each input row (including the last one with the 1) is transformed into an output row. But how?\n\nWait, maybe each output row corresponds to the input's row, but the pattern depends on the position of the 1 in the last input row. For example, in example 0, the last input row is [1,0], and the output's first 9 rows alternate between 8,1 and 1,8, and the last row is 1,8. But the last input row's output is 1,8. So perhaps the transformation for the last input row (the one with the 1) is to place the 1 in a certain position, and for the other rows (all zeros), they follow a pattern based on their row index and the position of the 1 in the last input row.\n\nAlternatively, the position of the 1 in the input's last row determines a starting position, and then each row in the output cycles through a certain movement. For example, the 1 moves left or right in each subsequent row.\n\nLet me try to model this for each example.\n\nFor example 0 (2 elements):\n\nInput's last row has 1 at position 0. The output's rows alternate between 1 at position 1 and 0. The first output row is [8,1], then [1,8], etc. So the starting position is 1, then 0, then 1, etc. So the direction alternates each row. For 10 rows, the pattern repeats every 2 rows. So row 0:1, row1:0, row2:1, etc. The last row (row9) would be 0. But the example's output last row is [1,8], which is 0 position. Wait, in example 0's output, the last row is [1,8], which is 0's position. But according to the pattern, row 0 is [8,1] (position1), row1 [1,8] (position0), row2 [8,1], row3 [1,8], etc. So rows even indices (0,2,4,6,8) have 1 at position1, and odd indices (1,3,5,7,9) at position0. So yes, the last row (index9) is position0. That matches.\n\nIn example1 (3 elements), the output's rows have 1 at positions: 1,0,1,2,1,0,1,2,1,0. So row0:1, row1:0, row2:1, row3:2, row4:1, row5:0, etc. So the movement is like 1\u21920\u21921\u21922\u21921\u21920\u21921\u21922\u21921\u21920. So the pattern is increasing to 2, then decreasing back to 0, repeating. So for every 4 rows, the 1 moves 0\u21921\u21922\u21921\u21920, etc. But the exact pattern seems to be a cycle of 1,0,1,2, then 1,0, etc.\n\nFor example2 (4 elements), the positions are 3,2,1,0,1,2,3,2,1,0. So starting from 3 (last position), move left to 0 (first), then right to 3 again, then left again. So the pattern is a full left-right sweep.\n\nSo the number of elements in the array determines the movement pattern. For 2 elements: alternate between positions. For 3 elements: a back-and-forth between 0,1,2. For 4 elements: a full left-right sweep.\n\nNow, the test input is a 5-element array. The input's last row is [1,0,0,0,0], so 1 is at index0. Based on the previous patterns, the starting position for the output's first row would be the opposite end (index4). Then the movement would be leftwards until index0, then rightwards again, etc.\n\nSo for 5 elements, the pattern would be:\n\nStart at 4 (opposite of input's 1 at 0), then 3, 2, 1, 0, then 1, 2, 3,4, then 3,2,1,0, etc., but given that there are 10 rows, we need to see how the positions would cycle.\n\nLet's list the positions for each row in the test output. Let's assume the pattern is similar to example 2 but extended to 5 elements. For example2 (4 elements), the positions are 3,2,1,0,1,2,3,2,1,0. So for 5 elements, perhaps:\n\nRow0:4 \u2192 [8,8,8,8,1]\n\nRow1:3 \u2192 [8,8,8,1,8]\n\nRow2:2 \u2192 [8,8,1,8,8]\n\nRow3:1 \u2192 [8,1,8,8,8]\n\nRow4:0 \u2192 [1,8,8,8,8]\n\nRow5:1 \u2192 [8,1,8,8,8]\n\nRow6:2 \u2192 [8,8,1,8,8]\n\nRow7:3 \u2192 [8,8,8,1,8]\n\nRow8:4 \u2192 [8,8,8,8,1]\n\nRow9:3 \u2192 [8,8,8,1,8]\n\nBut wait, the example2's pattern after reaching 0 (row3) then goes to 1 (row4), 2 (row5), 3 (row6), then back to 2 (row7), 1 (row8), 0 (row9). So for 5 elements, maybe after reaching 0 (row4), the direction reverses again to move right, so row5 is 1, row6 2, row7 3, row8 4, row9 3.\n\nSo the positions would be:\n\nRow0:4\n\nRow1:3\n\nRow2:2\n\nRow3:1\n\nRow4:0\n\nRow5:1\n\nRow6:2\n\nRow7:3\n\nRow8:4\n\nRow9:3\n\nSo the output rows would be:\n\nRow0: [8,8,8,8,1]\n\nRow1: [8,8,8,1,8]\n\nRow2: [8,8,1,8,8]\n\nRow3: [8,1,8,8,8]\n\nRow4: [1,8,8,8,8]\n\nRow5: [8,1,8,8,8]\n\nRow6: [8,8,1,8,8]\n\nRow7: [8,8,8,1,8]\n\nRow8: [8,8,8,8,1]\n\nRow9: [8,8,8,1,8]\n\nBut let's check the example2. In example2's output, the last row (row9) is [1,8,8,8], which corresponds to position0. But according to the pattern, row9 would be 0. But in example2's output, row9 is [1,8,8,8], which is position0. However, looking at example2's output, row9 is the last row and it's [1,8,8,8], which is position0. But according to the pattern I thought, row9 would be 0. That matches. So for example2, the movement is 3\u21922\u21921\u21920\u21921\u21922\u21923\u21922\u21921\u21920. Wait, no. Let me recheck example2's output rows:\n\nRow0: [8,8,8,1] \u2192 pos3\n\nRow1: [8,8,1,8] \u2192 pos2\n\nRow2: [8,1,8,8] \u2192 pos1\n\nRow3: [1,8,8,8] \u2192 pos0\n\nRow4: [8,1,8,8] \u2192 pos1\n\nRow5: [8,8,1,8] \u2192 pos2\n\nRow6: [8,8,8,1] \u2192 pos3\n\nRow7: [8,8,1,8] \u2192 pos2\n\nRow8: [8,1,8,8] \u2192 pos1\n\nRow9: [1,8,8,8] \u2192 pos0\n\nSo the positions for example2 are: 3,2,1,0,1,2,3,2,1,0. Which is a full cycle moving left to 0, then right to 3, then left to 0 again. So for 4 elements, the pattern is left until 0, then right until 3, then left again. But since there are 10 rows, it's possible that after reaching 3 (row6), the next step is 2 (row7), 1 (row8), 0 (row9).\n\nSo for 5 elements, the pattern would be: start at 4, move left to 0 (rows0-4), then move right to 4 (rows5-8), then back to 3 (row9). But with 10 rows, let's see:\n\nRow0:4\n\nRow1:3\n\nRow2:2\n\nRow3:1\n\nRow4:0\n\nRow5:1\n\nRow6:2\n\nRow7:3\n\nRow8:4\n\nRow9:3\n\nSo that's the positions. So the output would be:\n\nRow0: [8,8,8,8,1]\n\nRow1: [8,8,8,1,8]\n\nRow2: [8,8,1,8,8]\n\nRow3: [8,1,8,8,8]\n\nRow4: [1,8,8,8,8]\n\nRow5: [8,1,8,8,8]\n\nRow6: [8,8,1,8,8]\n\nRow7: [8,8,8,1,8]\n\nRow8: [8,8,8,8,1]\n\nRow9: [8,8,8,1,8]\n\nBut let's check the test input. The test input has 10 rows of [0,0,0,0,0] except the last row which is [1,0,0,0,0]. So the output should have 10 rows. According to our pattern, the last row (row9) would be [8,8,8,1,8]. \n\nComparing this with the training examples, the pattern seems to fit. For example, in example2 (4 elements), the last row of the output is [1,8,8,8], which is position0. But according to the pattern, row9 would be position0, which it is. So perhaps for the 5-element case, the last row (row9) is position3. \n\nSo the output for the test input should follow this pattern. Each output row is the array filled with 8s except for a single 1 that moves according to the pattern described."
