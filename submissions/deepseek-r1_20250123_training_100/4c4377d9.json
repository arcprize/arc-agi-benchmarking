        "cot_1": "Okay, let's tackle this puzzle. So, the task is to figure out the pattern that transforms the input arrays into the output arrays. Let's look at the training examples carefully.\n\nStarting with Example 0. The input has three rows:\n[9,9,5,9]\n[5,5,9,9]\n[9,5,9,9]\n\nThe output has six rows. Looking at the output, it seems like the original three rows are rearranged and then repeated. Let me check the order. The output starts with the third input row [9,5,9,9], then the second [5,5,9,9], then the first [9,9,5,9]. Then that same sequence is repeated again. So it's like reverse the order of the original rows, then repeat them again. Wait, in Example 0, the input is three rows, output is six rows. So the output is the reversed input followed by the original input again? Let's see:\n\nOriginal input order: row0, row1, row2.\n\nOutput is row2, row1, row0, then row0, row1, row2. Wait no. Let me check:\n\nExample0 output is:\n[9,5,9,9] (row2)\n[5,5,9,9] (row1)\n[9,9,5,9] (row0)\nthen again:\n[9,9,5,9] (row0)\n[5,5,9,9] (row1)\n[9,5,9,9] (row2)\n\nSo the output is reversed original rows, then the original rows again. Wait, the first three rows are reversed input, and the next three are original input. Let me confirm:\n\nOriginal input is:\n\nRow0: [9,9,5,9]\n\nRow1: [5,5,9,9]\n\nRow2: [9,5,9,9]\n\nOutput first three rows: row2, row1, row0. Then the next three are row0, row1, row2 again? Wait no. Let me look at the output of Example0 again:\n\nOutput is:\n\n[9,5,9,9] (row2)\n\n[5,5,9,9] (row1)\n\n[9,9,5,9] (row0)\n\nThen again:\n\n[9,9,5,9] (row0)\n\n[5,5,9,9] (row1)\n\n[9,5,9,9] (row2)\n\nSo the first three rows are reverse order of the input (row2, row1, row0), and then the next three rows are the original order (row0, row1, row2). So the output is reverse followed by original, making the total of 6 rows. \n\nLet me check Example1. Input is:\n\n[4,1,1,4]\n\n[1,1,1,1]\n\n[4,4,4,1]\n\nOutput:\n\n[4,4,4,1] (row2)\n\n[1,1,1,1] (row1)\n\n[4,1,1,4] (row0)\n\nThen again:\n\n[4,1,1,4] (row0)\n\n[1,1,1,1] (row1)\n\n[4,4,4,1] (row2)\n\nSame pattern here. Reverse the input rows and append the original input rows. So for each example, the output is the reverse of the input rows followed by the original input rows. Let's check other examples.\n\nExample2 input:\n\n[9,4,9,4]\n\n[9,9,4,4]\n\n[4,4,4,4]\n\nOutput:\n\n[4,4,4,4] (row2)\n\n[9,9,4,4] (row1)\n\n[9,4,9,4] (row0)\n\nThen original rows:\n\n[9,4,9,4] (row0)\n\n[9,9,4,4] (row1)\n\n[4,4,4,4] (row2)\n\nYes, same pattern. So the output is the reversed list of input rows followed by the original list of input rows. Then why in Example0's output, after reversing, the next part is original again. So total of 6 rows (3 reversed, 3 original). \n\nSo the pattern is: take the input rows in reverse order (starting from the last row to the first) and then append the original rows. So if the input is 3 rows, the output is 6 rows, first 3 reversed, then 3 original.\n\nTesting this with the test input. The test input is three rows:\n\n[4,4,9,9]\n\n[4,4,4,4]\n\n[4,4,9,9]\n\nSo the reversed order would be the third row, then the second, then the first. Then followed by the original order.\n\nWait, the input is:\n\nRow0: [4,4,9,9]\n\nRow1: [4,4,4,4]\n\nRow2: [4,4,9,9]\n\nReversed order would be row2, row1, row0. Then original is row0, row1, row2.\n\nSo the output would be:\n\nRow2: [4,4,9,9]\n\nRow1: [4,4,4,4]\n\nRow0: [4,4,9,9]\n\nThen original:\n\nRow0: [4,4,9,9]\n\nRow1: [4,4,4,4]\n\nRow2: [4,4,9,9]\n\nPutting that all together, the output would be:\n\n[4,4,9,9]\n\n[4,4,4,4]\n\n[4,4,9,9]\n\n[4,4,9,9]\n\n[4,4,4,4]\n\n[4,4,9,9]\n\nWait, but that's the same as the reversed part, because row2 and row0 are the same. Let me see. The input rows are:\n\nRow0: [4,4,9,9]\n\nRow1: [4,4,4,4]\n\nRow2: [4,4,9,9]\n\nSo reversing them gives row2, row1, row0. Which is [4,4,9,9], [4,4,4,4], [4,4,9,9]. Then the original is row0, row1, row2: [4,4,9,9], [4,4,4,4], [4,4,9,9]. So the output would have these six rows. But looking at the training examples, when there are duplicates, like in Example0's input, the output still follows the pattern. For instance, in Example0, the first and third rows are similar but not the same. But in the test case, row0 and row2 are identical. So following the same logic, the output would be the reversed list (row2, row1, row0) which is same as original list (since row0 and row2 are the same). So the output would be six rows, first three as reversed, then original. But since row0 and row2 are same, the first three rows would be [4,4,9,9], [4,4,4,4], [4,4,9,9], and the next three would be the same as the first three. So the output would have these six rows. Let me check the training examples again to see if there's any other pattern.\n\nWait, looking at Example3:\n\nInput:\n[3,3,5,5]\n[3,5,5,3]\n[5,5,3,3]\n\nOutput is:\n[5,5,3,3] (row2)\n[3,5,5,3] (row1)\n[3,3,5,5] (row0)\nThen original:\n[3,3,5,5] (row0)\n[3,5,5,3] (row1)\n[5,5,3,3] (row2)\n\nSo yes, the same pattern applies. So the test input's output would be the reversed rows followed by the original rows. Even if some rows are same, the pattern still holds. So applying this to the test input, the output should be:\n\nFirst three rows: reversed order (row2, row1, row0) \u2192 [4,4,9,9], [4,4,4,4], [4,4,9,9]\n\nThen original order (row0, row1, row2) \u2192 [4,4,9,9], [4,4,4,4], [4,4,9,9]\n\nSo combining them, the output is six rows as follows:\n\nRow1: [4,4,9,9]\n\nRow2: [4,4,4,4]\n\nRow3: [4,4,9,9]\n\nRow4: [4,4,9,9]\n\nRow5: [4,4,4,4]\n\nRow6: [4,4,9,9]\n\nWait, no. Wait, the reversed order is row2, row1, row0. So row2 is [4,4,9,9], row1 is [4,4,4,4], row0 is [4,4,9,9]. So first three rows are:\n\n[4,4,9,9]\n\n[4,4,4,4]\n\n[4,4,9,9]\n\nThen original is:\n\nrow0: [4,4,9,9]\n\nrow1: [4,4,4,4]\n\nrow2: [4,4,9,9]\n\nSo the entire output is:\n\n[4,4,9,9]\n\n[4,4,4,4]\n\n[4,4,9,9]\n\n[4,4,9,9]\n\n[4,4,4,4]\n\n[4,4,9,9]\n\nWhich is the correct pattern. Let me check if any of the training examples have this situation where reversed and original are same. For example, if the input was symmetric in rows, then reversed order would be same as original. But in the test case, since row0 and row2 are same, the reversed order is same as the original. So the output would be the reversed (same as original) followed by original again. So the output is two copies of the original. But in the test input, the original has three rows, so the output would have six rows. \n\nTherefore, the answer should be the reversed input rows followed by the original input rows. Applying that to the test input.",

        "cot_2": "Okay, let's tackle this puzzle. The task is to figure out the pattern that transforms the given input lists into the output lists. Let me start by looking at the training examples closely.\n\nLooking at Example 0:\n\nInput has three lists:\n[9,9,5,9]\n[5,5,9,9]\n[9,5,9,9]\n\nOutput has six lists arranged in two groups of three. The output is:\n[9,5,9,9]\n[5,5,9,9]\n[9,9,5,9]\n[9,9,5,9]\n[5,5,9,9]\n[9,5,9,9]\n\nWait, so the output is the original input lists reversed in order, then followed by the original input again? Let me check. The input lists are in order 0,1,2. The output starts with list 2, then list 1, then list 0. Then it repeats lists 0,1,2 again but maybe in the original order? Wait no. Wait the first three outputs are list2, list1, list0. Then the next three are list0 reversed? Wait, looking at example 0's input and output:\n\nOriginal input lists (0,1,2):\n\n0: [9,9,5,9]\n\n1: [5,5,9,9]\n\n2: [9,5,9,9]\n\nOutput:\n\nFirst three lines:\n\n[9,5,9,9] (which is list2)\n\n[5,5,9,9] (list1)\n\n[9,9,5,9] (list0 but reversed?)\n\nWait, original list0 is [9,9,5,9]. Reversed would be [9,5,9,9], but here the output's third line in first part is [9,9,5,9], which is the original list0. Wait no, the third line of the first three in the output is [9,9,5,9], which is list0. Then why is the first part list2, list1, list0. Then the next three lines are list0, list1, list2 again? Let me check.\n\nIn Example0's output, after the first three, the next three are [9,9,5,9] (list0), [5,5,9,9] (list1), [9,5,9,9] (list2). So the output is arranged as list2, list1, list0 followed by list0, list1, list2. Wait, but looking at the output, it's:\n\nFirst three:\n\nlist2, list1, list0.\n\nThen the next three:\n\nlist0, list1, list2.\n\nWait no, because the original input's list0 is [9,9,5,9], and the output's fourth line is [9,9,5,9] which is the same as list0. So the output is:\n\nFirst part:\n\nlist2, list1, list0.\n\nSecond part:\n\nlist0, list1, list2.\n\nBut that would make 6 entries. Let's count:\n\nYes, the output for example 0 has 6 lines, split into two groups of three. The first group is the reverse order of the input lists, and the second group is the original input lists. So the output is the input lists reversed, then the original input lists again. So for each example, the output is the original lists in reverse order followed by the original order. But wait, in Example0, the first three lines are list2, list1, list0. Then the next three are list0, list1, list2. So the output is reverse(input) concatenated with input. So the total lines would be 3 (reverse) +3 (original) =6 lines. Let's check other examples.\n\nLooking at Example1:\n\nInput lists:\n\n0: [4,1,1,4]\n\n1: [1,1,1,1]\n\n2: [4,4,4,1]\n\nOutput is:\n\nFirst three: list2, list1, list0.\n\nlist2 is [4,4,4,1] (input list2) \u2192 first line.\n\nlist1 is [1,1,1,1] \u2192 second line.\n\nlist0 is [4,1,1,4] \u2192 third line.\n\nThen fourth line is list0 again (original list0), fifth line list1, sixth line list2. So yes, the output is reverse(input) followed by original input.\n\nBut wait, in Example0's first three lines, list2 is [9,5,9,9], which is the third input list, then list1 is [5,5,9,9], then list0 is [9,9,5,9]. Then the next three are list0, list1, list2. So the output is reverse order of the input lists, then the input lists in original order. So for all examples, the output is reverse(input lists) concatenated with the input lists. That would make sense.\n\nTesting this pattern with Example2:\n\nInput lists:\n\n[9,4,9,4], [9,9,4,4], [4,4,4,4]\n\nOutput is:\n\n[4,4,4,4] (list2), [9,9,4,4] (list1), [9,4,9,4] (list0) \u2192 reversed order.\n\nThen original input lists: [9,4,9,4] (list0), [9,9,4,4] (list1), [4,4,4,4] (list2). So yes, the output is reversed input followed by original input.\n\nSame with Example3:\n\nInput lists:\n\n[3,3,5,5], [3,5,5,3], [5,5,3,3]\n\nReversed order would be list2: [5,5,3,3], list1: [3,5,5,3], list0: [3,3,5,5]. Then original input lists again. The output matches that.\n\nSo the pattern is that the output is the input lists in reverse order (so first the last list, then the middle, then the first), followed by the original input lists in their original order. So the output is two blocks: reversed input lists and then original input lists.\n\nSo for the test input:\n\nTest Input:\n\n[4,4,9,9] (list0)\n\n[4,4,4,4] (list1)\n\n[4,4,9,9] (list2)\n\nReversed order would be list2, list1, list0.\n\nSo reversed order:\n\nFirst three lines: list2 [4,4,9,9], list1 [4,4,4,4], list0 [4,4,9,9].\n\nThen original order: list0 [4,4,9,9], list1 [4,4,4,4], list2 [4,4,9,9].\n\nWait, but the test input's list0 and list2 are the same. So the reversed order would be list2 (same as list0), list1, list0. Then original order is list0, list1, list2 (same as list0). So the output would be:\n\n[4,4,9,9] (list2)\n\n[4,4,4,4] (list1)\n\n[4,4,9,9] (list0)\n\nThen original:\n\n[4,4,9,9] (list0)\n\n[4,4,4,4] (list1)\n\n[4,4,9,9] (list2)\n\nSo putting it all together, the output would have six lines:\n\nFirst three: list2, list1, list0 \u2192 [4,4,9,9], [4,4,4,4], [4,4,9,9]\n\nThen next three: list0, list1, list2 \u2192 [4,4,9,9], [4,4,4,4], [4,4,9,9]\n\nBut looking at the training examples, the outputs for each case had reversed followed by original. So for the test input, this would be the case.\n\nBut wait, in the training examples, the reversed lists were the order of the input lists reversed, not each individual list reversed. So the order of the lists is reversed, not the elements within each list.\n\nYes. So the transformation is: reverse the order of the input lists (so if original input is list0, list1, list2, then reversed is list2, list1, list0) and then append the original input lists as they are. So the output is the reversed lists followed by the original lists.\n\nTherefore, applying this to the test input:\n\nTest Input lists in order:\n\nlist0: [4,4,9,9]\n\nlist1: [4,4,4,4]\n\nlist2: [4,4,9,9]\n\nReversed lists: list2, list1, list0 \u2192 which are [4,4,9,9], [4,4,4,4], [4,4,9,9]\n\nOriginal lists: list0, list1, list2 \u2192 same as input.\n\nSo the output is the concatenation of reversed lists and original lists.\n\nThus, the output should be:\n\n[4,4,9,9]\n\n[4,4,4,4]\n\n[4,4,9,9]\n\n[4,4,9,9]\n\n[4,4,4,4]\n\n[4,4,9,9]\n\nBut wait, let me check that. The reversed lists are list2, list1, list0. Since list2 and list0 are the same, the first three lines would be list2 (same as list0), list1, list0 (same as list2). Then the original lists are list0, list1, list2 (same as list0). So the output would be:\n\nFirst three:\n\n[4,4,9,9] (list2)\n\n[4,4,4,4] (list1)\n\n[4,4,9,9] (list0)\n\nThen original:\n\n[4,4,9,9] (list0)\n\n[4,4,4,4] (list1)\n\n[4,4,9,9] (list2)\n\nSo combining these, the output is six lines as above. This matches the pattern from the training examples. So the answer should be the reversed lists followed by the original lists."
