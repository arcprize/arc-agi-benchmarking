        "cot_1": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. So, the problem is to transform the input lists into output lists based on some hidden rule. Let's look at the training examples to understand what's going on.\n\nStarting with Example 0. The input has 9 lists, and the output has 4. Hmm, maybe the output is derived from combining some of the input lists. Wait, the input has 9 lists, and the output 4. Let me check the count. For example 0's input: there are 9 rows, and output 4 rows. Maybe the first four input rows are processed into the first output, and the next ones into others? Or perhaps there's a grouping.\n\nLooking at the input for Example 0:\n\nInput lists:\n[1,1,0,0]\n[0,1,0,1]\n[0,1,0,0]\n[1,0,1,0]\n[4,4,4,4]\n[2,2,2,2]\n[0,0,2,2]\n[2,2,0,0]\n[0,0,2,2]\n\nOutput:\n[3,3,3,3]\n[0,3,3,3]\n[3,3,0,0]\n[3,0,3,3]\n\nWait, the fifth input list is [4,4,4,4], then [2,2,2,2], etc. The outputs all have 3s. Maybe the 4s and 2s are part of the transformation. Let's think about how 1, 2, 4 relate to 3 in the output. Because 1+2=3, and 4 is present in the input, maybe that's a clue.\n\nLooking at the output rows, perhaps each output row is a combination of three input rows. For example, in the first output row [3,3,3,3], maybe it's combining the first four input rows (since 1+0+0+1+ etc.?) Not sure. Alternatively, maybe each position in the output is determined by the sum of certain inputs. Let's take the first output element of the first output row, which is 3. Let's check the first elements of the first four input rows: 1,0,0,1. Summing those gives 2, but the output is 3. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 4 and 2 rows are involved. For instance, the fifth input is [4,4,4,4], sixth is [2,2,2,2], etc. Maybe the 4s and 2s are being combined with the 1s and 0s in some way. Like, when 4 is present in a position, and 2 is present in the same position in a different row, adding them gives 6, but that's not 3. Wait, maybe 4 and 2 are masks or indicators. Let's think differently.\n\nLooking at the first output of example 0: [3,3,3,3]. The input's fifth row is [4,4,4,4], sixth is [2,2,2,2]. Maybe when a position in the 4s row is 4 and the 2s row is 2, it's 3. But how do the other rows (the ones with 0s and 1s) factor in?\n\nWait, perhaps the input lists are divided into groups. The first four lists, then the fifth, then the next four (or similar). Let me check the structure. For example, in example 0, input has 9 lists. The output has 4. So maybe each output list is generated from three input lists. For example, the first four input lists (rows 0-3) plus the fifth (row4) and sixth (row5), etc. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 4s and 2s are indicating which parts of the previous rows to take. For instance, the fifth row being [4,4,4,4] could mean that each element is 4, perhaps signaling to take the sum of the first four rows in each position. Then the sixth row [2,2,2,2] could mean another operation. But how does that lead to 3s?\n\nWait, another idea: each output element is 3 when the sum of 1s and 2s in that position across certain rows equals a particular value. For example, 1+2=3. So maybe if a position has both a 1 (from the first group) and a 2 (from the second group), it becomes 3. Let's check this.\n\nTake example 0's first output row [3,3,3,3]. The first four input rows are [1,1,0,0], [0,1,0,1], [0,1,0,0], [1,0,1,0]. Let's sum these for each position:\n\nFirst position: 1+0+0+1=2\nSecond: 1+1+1+0=3\nThird: 0+0+0+1=1\nFourth:0+1+0+0=1\n\nHmm, but the output is all 3s. So that doesn't add up. Maybe instead of summing, we're looking for presence. Like, if any of the first four rows has a 1 in that position, and any of the next rows (like the ones with 2s) has a 2, then set to 3. But then how to handle multiple entries.\n\nAlternatively, the input is divided into two sections. The first four rows, then a row of 4s, then some rows with 2s. Maybe the 4s are separators. Then, the rows after the 4s are part of the second group. For example, the first group (rows 0-3) and second group (rows 5-8). Then, the output is combining these two groups. So, for each position, if there's a 1 in the first group and a 2 in the second group, it becomes 3. If only 1 is present, maybe 0, and if only 2 is present, maybe 0. But how?\n\nWait, in example 0, first output row [3,3,3,3]. Let's look at the first group (first four rows):\n\nRow0: [1,1,0,0]\nRow1: [0,1,0,1]\nRow2: [0,1,0,0]\nRow3: [1,0,1,0]\n\nSecond group (after the 4s row):\n\nRow5: [2,2,2,2]\nRow6: [0,0,2,2]\nRow7: [2,2,0,0]\nRow8: [0,0,2,2]\n\nSo, for each position, if there is at least one 1 in the first group and at least one 2 in the second group, then output is 3. Otherwise, 0? Let's check.\n\nFirst output row in example 0 is [3,3,3,3]. For each position (four elements):\n\nFirst position: in first group, rows 0 and 3 have 1. In second group, rows5,7 have 2. So yes, 3.\n\nSecond position: first group has 1s in rows0,1,2. Second group rows5,6,7,8 have 2s. So 3.\n\nThird position: first group has 1 in row3 and 0 elsewhere. Second group has 2s in rows5,6,8. So 3.\n\nFourth position: first group has 1 in row1. Second group has 2s in rows5,6. So 3. Hence all 3s.\n\nBut in the second output row of example 0: [0,3,3,3]. Let's check the positions for this row.\n\nWait, but how are the output rows determined? Are they combining the first group and second group in a different way? Like, maybe each output row corresponds to a pair of rows from the first and second group.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each output row is the result of combining a row from the first group (rows0-3) with a row from the second group (rows5-8). Let's check.\n\nIn example0's output, there are four output rows. Since the first group has four rows (0-3) and the second group has four rows (5-8), perhaps each output row is combining row i from the first group with row i from the second group (assuming rows5-8 are the second group, after the 4s row).\n\nLet's check this for example0:\n\nOutput row0: [3,3,3,3]. If it's combining row0 and row5:\n\nRow0: [1,1,0,0]\nRow5: [2,2,2,2]\n\nIf 1 + 2 =3, then each position would be 3. Which matches the output. So output row0 could be the sum of row0 and row5.\n\nBut output row1 in example0 is [0,3,3,3]. Let's see. If it's combining row1 and row6:\n\nRow1: [0,1,0,1]\nRow6: [0,0,2,2]\n\nSumming each position:\n\n0+0=0 (position0)\n1+0=1 (position1)\n0+2=2 (position2)\n1+2=3 (position3)\n\nBut the output is [0,3,3,3], which doesn't match. So that approach might be incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is 3 if either the first group's row has a 1 OR the second group's row has a 2. But that would lead to 3s where either is present. For example, row0 and row5 would have 3 in all positions. But the output is all 3s. Then row1 and row6 would be:\n\nrow1: [0,1,0,1], row6: [0,0,2,2]\n\nSo positions:\n\n0: 0 OR 0 \u2192 0 (but output has 0 here)\n1:1 OR 0 \u21921 \u2192 but output is 3 here. So that's not matching.\n\nHmm. Alternatively, maybe it's a bitwise OR but 1+2=3. So if a position in the first group's row is 1 and the corresponding second group's row is 2, then sum to 3. Otherwise, if either is present but not both, maybe 0. But how?\n\nWait, in example0's output row1: [0,3,3,3]. Let's see:\n\nAssuming row1 (from first group) and row6 (from second group). The first group row1 is [0,1,0,1], second group row6 is [0,0,2,2].\n\nSo, for each position:\n\n0: 0 (from first) and 0 (from second) \u2192 0. So output 0.\n\n1:1 (from first) and 0 (from second) \u2192 1. But output is 3. So this approach doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's the presence of 1 in any of the first group rows and 2 in any of the second group rows. So for each position in the output, if there's a 1 in any row of the first group and a 2 in any row of the second group, then it's 3. Otherwise, 0. Let's check that for example0's first output row.\n\nBut in example0's first output row is [3,3,3,3], which would mean all positions meet that condition. Let's see:\n\nPosition0: in first group (rows0-3), any 1s? Yes, rows0 and 3 have 1. In second group (rows5-8), any 2s? Yes, rows5,7. So 3.\n\nYes, that would apply. Then for the entire output, each position is 3 if there's a 1 in any of the first group's rows and a 2 in any of the second group's rows. But then all four output rows in example0 would be the same. But they are not. For example, the third output row is [3,3,0,0]. So this approach can't be correct.\n\nAnother angle: the output rows correspond to the rows after the 4s row. For example, in example0, after the 4s row (row4), the next rows are 5-8 (four rows). The output has four rows. So perhaps each output row is generated from row4's 4s and one of the subsequent rows. Wait, row4 is [4,4,4,4]. Then, maybe for each row after row4 (rows5-8), combine with row4. But row4 is all 4s. So maybe 4 is a separator, and the output rows are generated from the rows after row4. But how?\n\nLooking at example0's output rows:\n\n[3,3,3,3] \u2192 perhaps row5 (all 2s) combined with 4s. 4 and 2 might sum to 6, but output is 3. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, 4 is a mask. Like, where there's a 4 in row4, use the value from the row after. But row4 is [4,4,4,4], and the rows after are 5-8. So maybe each of the output rows is combining the 4s row with the following rows. For example, row5 is [2,2,2,2]. So 4 and 2 in each position. Maybe 4+2=6, but 3? Not directly. Or perhaps the 4 and 2 are being treated as binary digits. 4 is 100, 2 is 010. 100 + 010 = 110 (binary 6), which doesn't match. Alternatively, the 4 represents something else.\n\nAlternatively, the 4s and 2s could be indicating a type. Like 4 is for the first group (maybe 1s) and 2 for the second group (maybe 0s). But I'm not seeing it.\n\nWait, looking at the output elements: they are all 0 or 3. So maybe 3 is a combination of 1 and 2. Like, 1 + 2 =3. So if in any position across the input groups, there's a 1 and a 2, then output 3. Otherwise, 0. But how are the groups structured?\n\nWait, the input has a row of all 4s. Maybe this acts as a separator between the first part (1s and 0s) and the second part (2s and 0s). So the rows before the 4s are part of group A (with 1s and 0s), and the rows after the 4s are group B (with 2s and 0s). Then, for each position in group A and group B, if there is at least one 1 in group A and at least one 2 in group B, then output 3. Otherwise, 0. Let's check this.\n\nFor example0's first output row: [3,3,3,3]. Group A (rows0-3) has 1s in all positions? Let's check each position:\n\nPosition0: rows0 and 3 have 1. So yes, group A has 1s here.\n\nGroup B (rows5-8): rows5,6,7,8. Position0: rows5 and 7 have 2. So group B has 2s here. So output 3.\n\nPosition1: group A has 1s in rows0,1,2. Group B has 2s in rows5,7,8. So 3.\n\nSimilarly for positions2 and 4. So all positions would be 3, which matches the first output row. But then why are there multiple output rows? Because this approach would generate only one row. But in example0, there are four output rows. So maybe each output row corresponds to a specific combination of rows from group A and group B.\n\nAlternatively, each output row is generated by checking for 1s in a particular row of group A and 2s in a particular row of group B. For example, the first output row combines row0 of group A with row5 of group B. So for each position, if row0 has a 1 and row5 has a 2, then output 3. Otherwise, 0.\n\nLooking at example0's first output row [3,3,3,3]. Group A row0: [1,1,0,0], group B row5: [2,2,2,2]. So in positions where row0 has 1 (positions0 and1) and row5 has 2 (all positions), so output 3 for positions0,1. But positions2 and3 in row0 are 0, so even though row5 has 2, if group A row0 has 0 there, then output 0. But the output here is 3 for all positions. So that's a contradiction.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is 3 if either group A row has 1 OR group B row has 2. But that would make the output row0's positions0 and1 as 3 (from group A), and positions2 and3 as 2 (from group B). But output is 3s everywhere. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAnother approach: the output rows are created by combining the rows of group A and group B in a specific way, such as XOR. But 1 XOR 2 is 3, which could make sense. Let's see. If in a position, group A's row has 1 and group B's row has 2, then output 3. If both are 0, output 0. If only group A has 1, output 1. If only group B has 2, output 2. But in the outputs, there are only 0 and 3. So maybe the output is 3 wherever there's a 1 in group A and a 2 in group B for the corresponding row pair. Otherwise 0.\n\nSo, for each output row, we pair group A's row i with group B's row i. Then, for each position, if group A's row i has 1 and group B's row i has 2, output 3. Else 0.\n\nLet's test this with example0.\n\nGroup A has 4 rows (rows0-3), group B has 4 rows (rows5-8). So output rows are 4.\n\nFirst output row: group A row0 ([1,1,0,0]) and group B row5 ([2,2,2,2]). For each position:\n\n1 & 2 \u2192 3. So all positions where group A row0 is 1 \u2192 positions0 and1. But group B row5 is 2 in all positions. So for positions0 and1: 3. Positions2 and3: group A row0 is 0, so 0. But the first output row is [3,3,3,3]. So this doesn't match. So this approach is incorrect.\n\nHmm. Let's look for another pattern. Maybe the output is determined by the sum of the corresponding elements in group A and group B. For example, group A has 1s and 0s, group B has 2s and 0s. So sum 1+2=3, 0+0=0, 1+0=1, 0+2=2. But in the output examples, there are only 0s and 3s. So perhaps the output is 3 if the sum is 3, else 0.\n\nSo for each position in group A and group B, if any row in group A has 1 and any row in group B has 2, then output 3. Otherwise, 0. But then each output row would be the same, which is not the case.\n\nAlternatively, for each output row, we take a specific combination. Like, for the first output row, maybe it's the sum of all group A rows (1s and 0s) and all group B rows (2s and 0s). So each position's sum is (number of 1s in group A)*1 + (number of 2s in group B)*2. But in example0, group A for position0 has two 1s (rows0 and3) \u2192 2. Group B for position0 has two 2s (rows5 and7). So 2*1 + 2*2=2+4=6. But output is 3. Not matching.\n\nAlternatively, if a position in group A has at least one 1 and in group B has at least one 2, output 3. Otherwise 0. But then each position in example0's first output would be 3, which is the case. But the output rows in example0 are different. For example, the third output row is [3,3,0,0]. So this approach would require that in some positions, group A doesn't have a 1 or group B doesn't have a 2. But how does that vary per output row?\n\nWait, maybe each output row corresponds to a specific pair of group A and group B rows. For example, output row i is generated by checking for each position if group A row i has 1 and group B row i has 2. If both are true, output 3; else 0.\n\nLet's test this for example0:\n\nGroup A has rows0-3, group B has rows5-8 (since row4 is the separator).\n\nOutput row0: [3,3,3,3]. So group A row0: [1,1,0,0], group B row5: [2,2,2,2]. For each position:\n\nPosition0: 1 and 2 \u21923 \u2192 yes.\n\nPosition1:1 and 2 \u21923.\n\nPosition2:0 and 2 \u2192 no \u2192 0. But output is 3 here. So this doesn't fit.\n\nSo this approach is incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, maybe for each position, if there is a 1 in group A's rows and a 2 in group B's rows in the same column, but not necessarily the same row. Then, for each output row, it's checking for some combination. But why the output rows vary.\n\nAnother thought: the output rows are merging the rows of group A and group B by replacing 1s with 3 if there's a corresponding 2 in the group B rows. For example, for each row in group A, if any position has a 1, and in the same position any row in group B has a 2, then that position in the output row is 3. But how are the output rows selected?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is a bitwise OR of group A and group B rows, but with 1 OR 2 = 3. Let's check:\n\nFor example0's first output row [3,3,3,3]. If group A row0 is [1,1,0,0], group B row5 is [2,2,2,2]. 1 OR 2 is 3 in binary (since 01 | 10 = 11). So that would give [3,3,2,2], but the output is all 3s. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, if group A row0 and group B row5 are combined, and 1+2=3, but only for positions where both are non-zero. Otherwise, 0. So for group A row0 and group B row5:\n\n[1+2, 1+2, 0+2, 0+2] \u2192 [3,3,2,2]. But the output is [3,3,3,3]. So that's not matching.\n\nHmm, perhaps this is getting too complicated. Let's look at another example to find a pattern.\n\nTake example1:\n\nInput:\n[1,1,1,0]\n[0,1,0,1]\n[0,0,1,1]\n[1,1,0,1]\n[4,4,4,4]\n[0,0,0,2]\n[0,0,0,2]\n[2,2,2,2]\n[2,2,0,2]\n\nOutput:\n[3,3,3,3]\n[0,3,0,3]\n[3,3,3,3]\n[3,3,0,3]\n\nGroup A is rows0-3. Group B is rows5-8.\n\nOutput row0: [3,3,3,3]. So for all positions, group A has at least one 1 and group B has at least one 2.\n\nPosition0: group A has 1 in row0 and 3. group B has 2 in row7 and 8. So yes.\n\nPosition1: group A has 1s in rows0,1,3. group B has 2s in rows7,8. So 3.\n\nPosition2: group A has 1s in row0,2,3. group B has 2 in row7. So 3.\n\nPosition3: group A has 1 in row0,1,3. group B has 2 in rows5,6,7,8. So 3.\n\nSo output row0 is all 3s.\n\nOutput row1: [0,3,0,3]. So positions 0 and 2 are 0. Let's check group B rows. For position0, group B has 2s in rows7 and 8 (rows5-8: rows5 is [0,0,0,2], rows6 is [0,0,0,2], row7 is [2,2,2,2], row8 is [2,2,0,2]. So group B has 2s in position0 in rows7 and 8. So group B has 2s here. Group A has 1 in position0 in row0 and row3. So why is the output here 0?\n\nWait, but output row1 is [0,3,0,3]. Maybe output row1 corresponds to group A row1 and group B row6.\n\nGroup A row1: [0,1,0,1]. Group B row6: [0,0,0,2].\n\nFor each position:\n\n0:0 (A) and 0 (B) \u2192 0.\n\n1:1 (A) and 0 (B) \u2192 no, since B is 0. So output 0. But output is 3 here. So this approach isn't right.\n\nAlternatively, output row1 is combining group A row1 and group B row6. If any 1 in group A row1 and 2 in group B row6, then 3. Else 0.\n\nGroup A row1: [0,1,0,1]. Group B row6: [0,0,0,2].\n\nPosition0: 0 and 0 \u21920.\n\nPosition1:1 and0 \u21920. But output is 3 here. So no.\n\nAnother idea: each output row is the result of OR between group A rows and group B rows, but with 1 and 2 becoming 3. For example, if any row in group A has 1 in a position and any row in group B has 2 in the same position, then output 3. Otherwise 0. But then all output rows would be the same, which isn't the case.\n\nLooking at example1's output row1: [0,3,0,3]. So for positions1 and3, it's 3. That suggests that in those positions, group A row1 has 1 and group B row6 has 2. But group B row6's position3 is 2. Group A row1's position3 is 1. So that would produce 3. But group B row6's position1 is 0. So why is output position1 3 here?\n\nHmm. Maybe the output rows are generated by combining the corresponding rows in group A and group B, but only if they are in the same position. For example, group A row0 with group B row5, group A row1 with group B row6, etc. Then, for each position in the combined rows, if group A's row has a 1 and group B's row has a 2, then output 3. Else 0.\n\nLet's test this for example1's output row1.\n\nGroup A row1: [0,1,0,1]\n\nGroup B row6: [0,0,0,2]\n\nSo for each position:\n\n0:0 and0 \u21920.\n\n1:1 and0 \u21920.\n\n2:0 and0 \u21920.\n\n3:1 and2 \u21923.\n\nBut the output row1 is [0,3,0,3]. So this doesn't match. So this approach isn't working.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output row is the maximum of group A and group B rows. For example, max(1,2) is 2, but the output is 3. So that's not helpful.\n\nAnother approach: the output is generated by adding 1s from group A and 2s from group B, but only if they are in the same row. For example, group A row0 and group B row5 combine to output row0. Each position in output row0 is 3 where group A has 1 and group B has 2, else 0. Let's check example0's first output row:\n\nGroup A row0: [1,1,0,0]\n\nGroup B row5: [2,2,2,2]\n\nSo for positions0 and1: 1 and 2 \u21923. Positions2 and3: 0 and2 \u21920. But the output row is [3,3,3,3], which doesn't fit. So this is not correct.\n\nWait, but example0's output row0 is [3,3,3,3]. How can that be achieved? If group B row5 is all 2s, and group A row0 has 1s in positions0 and1. So why output row0 has 3 in all positions? Maybe group B row5's positions2 and3 have 2s, but group A row0 has 0 there. So unless there's a different logic.\n\nWait, maybe the output is combining all rows in group A and group B. For example, for each position, if there is at least one 1 in any group A row and at least one 2 in any group B row, then output 3. Otherwise 0. So each output row is the same as the overall presence. But this can't explain varying output rows.\n\nLooking back at example0's output:\n\nOutput rows are:\n\n[3,3,3,3]\n\n[0,3,3,3]\n\n[3,3,0,0]\n\n[3,0,3,3]\n\nSo the same position can be 3 in some output rows and 0 in others. This suggests that each output row is processing different combinations. Perhaps each output row is formed by a different pair of group A and group B rows. For example, output row0 is group A row0 and group B row5, output row1 is group A row1 and group B row6, etc. Then, for each position in the pair, if both are non-zero, output 3. Else 0.\n\nLet's test this for example0's output row0:\n\nGroup A row0: [1,1,0,0]\n\nGroup B row5: [2,2,2,2]\n\nSo for each position, since both are non-zero (1 and 2), output 3. So all positions are 3. Which matches the output row0.\n\nOutput row1: group A row1 ([0,1,0,1]) and group B row6 ([0,0,2,2]).\n\nFor each position:\n\n0:0 and0 \u21920.\n\n1:1 and0 \u21920.\n\n2:0 and2 \u21920.\n\n3:1 and2 \u21923. \n\nBut the output row1 is [0,3,3,3]. So this doesn't fit. So this approach is incorrect.\n\nHmm. Another thought: perhaps the output rows are generated by merging group A and group B rows, but replacing 1s with 3 if there's a 2 in the same position in any of the group B rows. But again, the output rows vary.\n\nAlternatively, considering that the output rows in example0 are four in number, and group A has four rows and group B has four rows, maybe each output row is a combination of group A's row i and group B's row i+something. For example, row0 of group A with row5 of group B, row1 of group A with row6 of group B, row2 with row7, row3 with row8. Let's check:\n\nExample0's output row0: group A row0 and group B row5.\n\nPosition0: 1 and2 \u21923.\n\nPosition1:1 and2 \u21923.\n\nPosition2:0 and2 \u21920.\n\nPosition3:0 and2 \u21920.\n\nBut output row0 is [3,3,3,3]. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is 3 if there's a 1 in group A's row i and a 2 in group B's row j, where i and j are related in some way. But I'm not seeing it.\n\nWait, looking at example0's output row1: [0,3,3,3]. Let's see group A row1 ([0,1,0,1]) and group B row6 ([0,0,2,2]).\n\nFor each position:\n\n0:0 and0 \u21920.\n\n1:1 and0 \u21920.\n\n2:0 and2 \u21920.\n\n3:1 and2 \u21923.\n\nBut output row1 is [0,3,3,3]. So this approach isn't working.\n\nAnother angle: perhaps the output rows are the result of applying a bitwise XOR to the sum of group A and group B rows. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the output rows are the sum of the corresponding rows in group A and group B, but with 1+2=3, and 0+0=0. But in example0:\n\nGroup A row0: [1,1,0,0]\n\nGroup B row5: [2,2,2,2]\n\nSumming each position:1+2=3, 1+2=3, 0+2=2, 0+2=2. So output would be [3,3,2,2], but the actual output is [3,3,3,3]. So this doesn't match.\n\nAlternatively, the output is 3 wherever there's a 1 in group A or a 2 in group B. But that would give 3 wherever there's a 1 or 2. But group B has 0s and 2s, group A has 0s and 1s. So for example, in example0's group A row0 and group B row5:\n\nPositions0 and1: 1 \u21923.\n\nPositions2 and3: 2 \u21923. So output would be [3,3,3,3], which matches example0's output row0. But then output row1 would be:\n\nGroup A row1: [0,1,0,1], group B row6: [0,0,2,2].\n\nPositions where 1 or 2: 1 (positions1,3) or 2 (positions2,3). So output would be [0,3,3,3], which matches example0's output row1. Oh, this seems promising!\n\nLet's test this for example0's output rows:\n\nOutput row0: group A row0 and group B row5.\n\nGroup A row0: [1,1,0,0]\n\nGroup B row5: [2,2,2,2]\n\nFor each position, if group A has 1 OR group B has 2 \u2192 3. Else 0.\n\nSo positions0:1 OR 2 \u21923.\n\nPosition1:1 OR2 \u21923.\n\nPosition2:0 OR2 \u21923.\n\nPosition3:0 OR2 \u21923.\n\nSo output row0: [3,3,3,3], which matches.\n\nOutput row1: group A row1 and group B row6.\n\nGroup A row1: [0,1,0,1]\n\nGroup B row6: [0,0,2,2]\n\nPosition0:0 OR0 \u21920.\n\nPosition1:1 OR0 \u21923.\n\nPosition2:0 OR2 \u21923.\n\nPosition3:1 OR2 \u21923.\n\nSo output row1: [0,3,3,3], which matches.\n\nOutput row2: group A row2 and group B row7.\n\nGroup A row2: [0,1,0,0]\n\nGroup B row7: [2,2,0,0]\n\nPosition0:0 OR2 \u21923.\n\nPosition1:1 OR2 \u21923.\n\nPosition2:0 OR0 \u21920.\n\nPosition3:0 OR0 \u21920.\n\nOutput row2: [3,3,0,0], which matches.\n\nOutput row3: group A row3 and group B row8.\n\nGroup A row3: [1,0,1,0]\n\nGroup B row8: [0,0,2,2]\n\nPosition0:1 OR0 \u21923.\n\nPosition1:0 OR0 \u21920.\n\nPosition2:1 OR2 \u21923.\n\nPosition3:0 OR2 \u21923.\n\nSo output row3: [3,0,3,3], which matches example0's output.\n\nYes! This seems to be the pattern. So the output rows are generated by combining each row from group A (before the 4s) with the corresponding row from group B (after the 4s), index-wise. For each position in the combined rows, if the group A row has a 1 OR the group B row has a 2, then output 3. Otherwise, 0.\n\nBut wait, in the example0's output row0, group B row5 has 2s in all positions, so all are 3. In the output row1, group B row6 has 2s in positions2 and3, so those are 3, and group A row1 has 1s in positions1 and3, so positions1,2,3 are 3. But wait, group B row6's position0 is 0, group A row1's position0 is 0. So output is 0 there.\n\nSo the rule seems to be: for each output row i, take group A's row i and group B's row i (assuming group B starts after the 4s row). For each position in the row, if the group A's cell is 1 OR the group B's cell is 2, output 3. Else, 0.\n\nThis explains all the examples. Now let's verify this with example1.\n\nExample1's input:\n\nGroup A rows0-3:\n\nRow0: [1,1,1,0]\n\nRow1: [0,1,0,1]\n\nRow2: [0,0,1,1]\n\nRow3: [1,1,0,1]\n\nGroup B rows5-8:\n\nRow5: [0,0,0,2]\n\nRow6: [0,0,0,2]\n\nRow7: [2,2,2,2]\n\nRow8: [2,2,0,2]\n\nOutput rows are:\n\n[3,3,3,3] \u2192 group A row0 and B row5:\n\nGroup A row0: [1,1,1,0]\n\nGroup B row5: [0,0,0,2]\n\nFor each position:\n\n0:1 OR0 \u21923.\n\n1:1 OR0 \u21923.\n\n2:1 OR0 \u21923.\n\n3:0 OR2 \u21923.\n\nSo output [3,3,3,3]. Correct.\n\nOutput row1: [0,3,0,3]\n\nGroup A row1: [0,1,0,1]\n\nGroup B row6: [0,0,0,2]\n\nPosition0:0 OR0 \u21920.\n\n1:1 OR0 \u21923.\n\n2:0 OR0 \u21920.\n\n3:1 OR2 \u21923.\n\nSo output [0,3,0,3]. Correct.\n\nOutput row2: [3,3,3,3]\n\nGroup A row2: [0,0,1,1]\n\nGroup B row7: [2,2,2,2]\n\nEach position has either group B's 2, so all 3. Correct.\n\nOutput row3: [3,3,0,3]\n\nGroup A row3: [1,1,0,1]\n\nGroup B row8: [2,2,0,2]\n\nPosition0:1 OR2 \u21923.\n\nPosition1:1 OR2 \u21923.\n\nPosition2:0 OR0 \u21920.\n\nPosition3:1 OR2 \u21923.\n\nCorrect. So this pattern holds.\n\nNow, applying this to the test input:\n\nTest input:\n\n[1,0,1,0] \u2192 group A row0\n\n[1,0,1,0] \u2192 group A row1\n\n[0,1,0,0] \u2192 group A row2\n\n[1,0,1,0] \u2192 group A row3\n\n[4,4,4,4] \u2192 separator\n\n[2,2,0,0] \u2192 group B row5\n\n[0,0,2,0] \u2192 group B row6\n\n[0,2,0,2] \u2192 group B row7\n\n[2,2,2,0] \u2192 group B row8\n\nSo group A has 4 rows (0-3), group B has 4 rows (5-8).\n\nThe output rows will be 4, each combining group A's row i with group B's row i.\n\nLet's process each output row:\n\nOutput row0: group A row0 ([1,0,1,0]) + group B row5 ([2,2,0,0]).\n\nFor each position:\n\n0:1 OR2 \u21923.\n\n1:0 OR2 \u21923.\n\n2:1 OR0 \u21923.\n\n3:0 OR0 \u21920.\n\nSo output row0: [3,3,3,0]\n\nOutput row1: group A row1 ([1,0,1,0]) + group B row6 ([0,0,2,0]).\n\nPosition0:1 OR0 \u21923.\n\n1:0 OR0 \u21920.\n\n2:1 OR2 \u21923.\n\n3:0 OR0 \u21920.\n\nOutput row1: [3,0,3,0]\n\nOutput row2: group A row2 ([0,1,0,0]) + group B row7 ([0,2,0,2]).\n\nPosition0:0 OR0 \u21920.\n\n1:1 OR2 \u21923.\n\n2:0 OR0 \u21920.\n\n3:0 OR2 \u21923.\n\nOutput row2: [0,3,0,3]\n\nOutput row3: group A row3 ([1,0,1,0]) + group B row8 ([2,2,2,0]).\n\nPosition0:1 OR2 \u21923.\n\n1:0 OR2 \u21923.\n\n2:1 OR2 \u21923.\n\n3:0 OR0 \u21920.\n\nOutput row3: [3,3,3,0]\n\nBut wait, looking at the training examples' output formats, the outputs are usually four rows. Let's check if the order is correct.\n\nWait, in the test input, the group B rows are:\n\nRow5: [2,2,0,0]\n\nRow6: [0,0,2,0]\n\nRow7: [0,2,0,2]\n\nRow8: [2,2,2,0]\n\nSo the output rows would be:\n\nRow0: A0 + B5 \u2192 [3,3,3,0]\n\nRow1: A1 + B6 \u2192 [3,0,3,0]\n\nRow2: A2 + B7 \u2192 [0,3,0,3]\n\nRow3: A3 + B8 \u2192 [3,3,3,0]\n\nNow, let's check if this matches any of the training example patterns. For example, in example3, the output rows sometimes have leading zeros or 3s.\n\nBut according to the pattern we found, this is the expected output.",

        "cot_2": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. So, looking at the training examples, each input has a bunch of rows, and the output is another set of rows. Let's start by comparing the input and output rows in the examples to see what's changing.\n\nFirst, I notice that in all examples, the fifth row of the input is [4,4,4,4], and in the output, the first row is [3,3,3,3]. Hmm, maybe the 4s are transformed into 3s? But why?\n\nLooking at the other input rows. Let's take Example 0. The input has 9 rows, and the output has 4 rows. Wait, the output in each example has 4 rows. So maybe the first four rows of the input are transformed, but how?\n\nWait, maybe the input is split into two parts. The first four rows, then the fifth is the 4s, and then the next four rows (rows 5-8?), but in Example 0, the fifth input is [4,4,4,4], followed by [2,2,2,2], [0,0,2,2], etc. Then the outputs are four rows. Hmm, perhaps the outputs are combining the first four and the next four rows?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation involves adding or combining elements from the rows. Let's look at the first example's input and output.\n\nIn Example 0's input:\n\nInput rows:\n[1,1,0,0]\n[0,1,0,1]\n[0,1,0,0]\n[1,0,1,0]\n[4,4,4,4]\n[2,2,2,2]\n[0,0,2,2]\n[2,2,0,0]\n[0,0,2,2]\n\nOutput:\n[3,3,3,3]\n[0,3,3,3]\n[3,3,0,0]\n[3,0,3,3]\n\nHmm. The output has four rows. The first output row is all 3s, which might be related to the fifth input row (all 4s). The other output rows have a mix of 3s, 0s, and other numbers. Let's see if there's a pattern here.\n\nLooking at the first output row [3,3,3,3], which might be derived from the fifth input row [4,4,4,4]. If we subtract 1 from each element, 4-1=3. That could make sense. So maybe the fifth row becomes the first output row by subtracting 1 from each element.\n\nThen what about the rest? Let's check the other output rows. Let's take the second output row of Example 0: [0,3,3,3]. Let's see which input rows could contribute. The input rows after the fifth are [2,2,2,2], [0,0,2,2], [2,2,0,0], [0,0,2,2]. Maybe combining rows 6-9 in some way?\n\nWait, the input has 9 rows. The output is four rows. So perhaps the output rows are formed by combining the first four input rows and the next four (after the fifth) in some way. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by combining rows from the first group (before the [4,4,4,4]) and the second group (after the [4,4,4,4]) in some way. Let's take the first group: rows 0-3, and the second group: rows 5-8 (since row 4 is the 4s).\n\nFor Example 0, the first group is four rows, and the second group is four rows (rows 5-8). Then the output has four rows. So each output row could be a combination of a row from the first group and a row from the second group.\n\nLet's check the first output row after the [3,3,3,3]. Wait, in Example 0, the output is four rows. The first is [3,3,3,3], then three more. Wait, in the output examples, like Example 0's output is four rows, which might correspond to the four rows after processing. So perhaps the fifth input row (all 4s) is transformed into the first output row (all 3s), and then the next four input rows (rows 5-8) are processed in some way to form the remaining three output rows? Wait, but rows 5-8 in Example 0 are four rows. So maybe each of those is transformed into an output row, but how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is formed by combining each of the first four input rows (before the 4s) with each of the next four rows (after the 4s) using some operation. But that would generate more rows than the output.\n\nWait, looking at Example 0's output:\n\nOutput rows:\n[3,3,3,3] (from 4s)\n[0,3,3,3]\n[3,3,0,0]\n[3,0,3,3]\n\nSo the first output row is from the 4s row. Then the next three rows come from processing other input rows. But how?\n\nLooking at the input rows after the 4s in Example 0:\n\nRow5: [2,2,2,2]\nRow6: [0,0,2,2]\nRow7: [2,2,0,0]\nRow8: [0,0,2,2]\n\nBut the output after the first row is three rows. Hmm. Maybe it's combining pairs of rows? For example, rows5 and 6 are combined, rows7 and 8 are combined. But that would give two rows, but the output has three. Not matching.\n\nAnother approach: Let's check individual elements. Take the second output row of Example 0: [0,3,3,3]. Let's see which input elements could lead to that. If the 3s come from the 4s row (but 4-1=3), but then how do the 0s appear?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 3s are from replacing 2s and 1s. Let's see. For example, in the input rows after the 4s, rows5-8 are [2,2,2,2], [0,0,2,2], [2,2,0,0], [0,0,2,2]. If we look at the output rows after the first:\n\n[0,3,3,3] \u2192 perhaps combining elements from rows 6 and 5. Let's see. Row5 is all 2s. Row6 is [0,0,2,2]. If we take 0 from row6 and 2 from row5, 0+2=2, but the output is 3. Maybe it's 2+1=3? Where does the 1 come from?\n\nAlternatively, maybe each element in the output is 3 if either the corresponding element in the first group (before 4s) or the second group (after 4s) is non-zero. Let's check.\n\nTake Example 0's first group (before 4s):\n\nRow0: [1,1,0,0]\nRow1: [0,1,0,1]\nRow2: [0,1,0,0]\nRow3: [1,0,1,0]\n\nThen the second group (after 4s):\n\nRow5: [2,2,2,2]\nRow6: [0,0,2,2]\nRow7: [2,2,0,0]\nRow8: [0,0,2,2]\n\nWait, but the output has four rows. The first is from the 4s, then three others. Maybe the other three are combinations of these rows.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the first group (rows 0-3) and the second group (rows5-8) are somehow combined. Let's think: For each position in the output rows (excluding the first 3s row), if either the corresponding position in the first group or the second group has a non-zero, it becomes 3. Otherwise, 0.\n\nBut how is that applied? Let's take Example0's output row [0,3,3,3]. Let's see which positions in input rows could contribute.\n\nLooking at position 0: 0. So in that column, the first group rows (0-3) and second group rows (5-8) must both have 0. Let's check column 0:\n\nFirst group (rows0-3):\n\nRow0: 1\nRow1: 0\nRow2:0\nRow3:1\n\nSo in column0, the first group has 1s in row0 and row3, and 0s in rows1 and 2. The second group (rows5-8):\n\nRow5:2\nRow6:0\nRow7:2\nRow8:0\n\nSo for column0 in the second group, rows5 and 7 are 2, others 0.\n\nBut the output row [0,3,3,3] is the second row. Maybe each output row corresponds to a pair of rows from the first and second groups. For example, first output row after the 3s combines row0 and row5. Let's see: row0 is [1,1,0,0], row5 is [2,2,2,2]. If we add them: 1+2=3. So [3,3,2,2]. But that's not matching the output. The first output row after the initial 3s is [0,3,3,3]. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, if we take the sum of the elements from the first group and second group, and set to 3 if the sum is non-zero, else 0. But in that case, any sum >0 would be 3. Let's check.\n\nTake Example0's output row [0,3,3,3]. Suppose it's combining row1 and row6. Row1: [0,1,0,1], row6: [0,0,2,2]. Summing each element: 0+0=0, 1+0=1, 0+2=2, 1+2=3. Then converting to 3 if sum>0. So [0,3,3,3], which matches. Then that output row could be the combination of row1 and row6.\n\nSimilarly, the next output row [3,3,0,0] could be row2 and row7: row2 [0,1,0,0], row7 [2,2,0,0]. Sum: 2,3,0,0. Converted to 3s where sum>0: [3,3,0,0], which matches.\n\nThen the next output row [3,0,3,3] would be row3 and row8: row3 [1,0,1,0], row8 [0,0,2,2]. Sum:1,0,3,2 \u2192 converted to 3s where sum>0: [3,0,3,3]. Yes, that matches.\n\nSo the pattern seems to be: For the first four output rows (but wait, in the examples, the output has four rows. The first row is from the 4s row (converted to 3s). Then the next three output rows are combinations of the first group's rows 1,2,3 with the second group's rows 6,7,8. Wait, because in Example0, the first output row after the initial 3s is combining row1 and row6 (the second row of the first group and the second row of the second group, but row5 is the first in the second group. Wait, perhaps the second group starts at row5 (after the 4s), which is the fifth row (0-based index 5). So the second group has rows5,6,7,8 (four rows). Then the first group has rows0-3 (four rows). \n\nThen, the output after the initial 3s row is combining each row in the first group with the corresponding row in the second group, but shifted by one. Like, row0 with row5, row1 with row6, row2 with row7, row3 with row8. But in Example0, the output after the first 3s row has three rows. Wait, maybe the first group is four rows, the second group is four rows (rows5-8), but the output is combining row1 with row5, row2 with row6, etc. Or maybe the first group's rows 1-3 (since the first group is four rows) are combined with the second group's rows5-7. But not sure.\n\nWait in Example0, after the initial 3s row, there are three output rows. But the first group has four rows and the second group has four rows. So perhaps the first output row after the initial is combining row1 with row5, row2 with row6, etc. But let's check.\n\nIn Example0, the output after the initial 3s is three rows. Let's see:\n\nFirst output after 3s: [0,3,3,3] \u2192 which could be row1 (0,1,0,1) and row5 (2,2,2,2). Summing: 0+2=2, 1+2=3, 0+2=2, 1+2=3 \u2192 converting to 3s where sum is non-zero: [3,3,3,3]. But the output is [0,3,3,3]. Hmm, that doesn't match. So maybe not sum.\n\nAlternatively, for each position, if either the first group row or the second group row has a non-zero value, set to 3. Otherwise, 0. Let's see:\n\nRow1 is [0,1,0,1], row5 is [2,2,2,2]. So any position where either is non-zero would be 3. So all positions except the first in row1 are non-zero. So output would be [3,3,3,3], but the actual output is [0,3,3,3]. So that's not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's a bitwise OR where any non-zero becomes 3. For example, in row1 and row5: \n\nRow1 has elements [0,1,0,1], row5 has [2,2,2,2]. If either is non-zero, set to 3. But in that case, all elements would be 3. But the output has a 0 in the first position. So that's conflicting.\n\nWait, the output in Example0's second row is [0,3,3,3]. The first element is 0. So in that position, both the first group's row1 and the second group's row5 must be zero. But row5's first element is 2. So how does that lead to 0? That doesn't make sense.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output rows after the initial 3s are combining the second group's rows (rows5-8) with some operation. For example, rows5-8 are [2,2,2,2], [0,0,2,2], [2,2,0,0], [0,0,2,2]. If we take each row and replace non-zero with 3, then rows5 becomes [3,3,3,3], row6 becomes [0,0,3,3], row7 becomes [3,3,0,0], row8 becomes [0,0,3,3]. Then the output for Example0 after the initial row is [3,3,3,3], [0,0,3,3], [3,3,0,0], [0,0,3,3]. But the actual output is different. The output for Example0's second row is [0,3,3,3], which is not matching any of these.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each output row after the first is formed by taking the corresponding row from the second group (rows5-8) and adding 1 to each element. For example, row5 is [2,2,2,2], adding 1 gives 3s. But row6 is [0,0,2,2], adding 1 gives [1,1,3,3], but the output row is [0,3,3,3], which doesn't match. So that's not right.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by replacing 0s with 3s where there are non-zero entries in the first group. But how?\n\nWait, let's look at Example0's output rows again. The second output row is [0,3,3,3]. Let's check the first group's row1: [0,1,0,1]. So the non-zero elements here are positions 1 and 3. The second group's row6 is [0,0,2,2]. The non-zero elements are positions 2 and 3. Combining these, the output's non-zero positions are 1,2,3. So maybe for each position, if either the first group's row (from 0-3) or the second group's row (from 5-8) has a non-zero, it becomes 3. But how are the rows paired?\n\nWait, perhaps each output row after the first is formed by taking a row from the first group and a row from the second group, and for each element, if either is non-zero, it becomes 3, else 0. But which rows are paired?\n\nIn Example0, the second output row is [0,3,3,3]. Let's see which pair of input rows could produce this.\n\nIf we pair row0 (first group) and row5 (second group):\n\nRow0: [1,1,0,0]\nRow5: [2,2,2,2]\n\nCombining: 1 or 2 \u2192 non-zero \u2192 3. So all elements would be 3. But the output is [0,3,3,3]. Doesn't match.\n\nIf we pair row1 (first group) and row5 (second group):\n\nRow1: [0,1,0,1]\nRow5: [2,2,2,2]\n\nCombining: any element where either is non-zero. So all elements except the first in row1 (0) and the first in row5 (2) would be 3. Wait, no. The first element in row1 is 0, but row5's is 2. So combining would result in 3 for first element. But the output's first element is 0. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's the sum of the first group's row and the second group's row. If the sum is greater than or equal to 1, then 3; else 0. But in that case, even a sum of 1 would result in 3.\n\nFor Example0's second output row [0,3,3,3], maybe the sum of the corresponding elements is 0 in the first position and non-zero in others. So perhaps for the first element, sum is 0 (0 from first group and 0 from second group), leading to 0. Other elements: sum is 1+0=1, 0+2=2, 1+2=3 \u2192 so all would be 3. That would give [0,3,3,3].\n\nBut which rows would that be? Let's see. For the first element to sum to 0, both rows must have 0. So first group's row and second group's row have 0 in that position. Let's look for such pairs.\n\nFirst group's rows:\n\nRow0: 1,1,0,0\n\nRow1:0,1,0,1\n\nRow2:0,1,0,0\n\nRow3:1,0,1,0\n\nSecond group's rows (after 4s):\n\nRow5:2,2,2,2\n\nRow6:0,0,2,2\n\nRow7:2,2,0,0\n\nRow8:0,0,2,2\n\nSo, for the first element in the pair to sum to 0, we need a row from the first group with 0 and a row from the second group with 0 in the first position.\n\nLooking at first group rows:\n\nRow1's first element is 0, row2's is 0, row0 and row3 have 1.\n\nSecond group rows:\n\nRow6 and row8 have 0 in the first element.\n\nSo, pairing row1 (first group) with row6 (second group):\n\nRow1: [0,1,0,1]\n\nRow6: [0,0,2,2]\n\nSum per element: 0+0=0, 1+0=1, 0+2=2, 1+2=3.\n\nSo converting sums >=1 to 3 and 0 otherwise: [0,3,3,3]. Which matches the second output row of Example0.\n\nThen, the next output row in Example0 is [3,3,0,0]. Let's see. Summing row2 (0,1,0,0) and row7 (2,2,0,0):\n\nSum:0+2=2, 1+2=3, 0+0=0, 0+0=0 \u2192 converted to [3,3,0,0]. Which matches.\n\nNext output row: [3,0,3,3]. Summing row3 (1,0,1,0) and row8 (0,0,2,2):\n\nSum:1+0=1, 0+0=0, 1+2=3, 0+2=2 \u2192 converted to [3,0,3,3]. Which matches.\n\nSo the pattern seems to be:\n\n1. The fifth input row (all 4s) is converted to [3,3,3,3] by subtracting 1 from each element.\n\n2. For the remaining output rows, each is formed by taking a row from the first group (rows0-3) and a row from the second group (rows5-8), pairing row1 with row6, row2 with row7, row3 with row8, etc. Wait, but in Example0, the output after the initial 3s row has three rows, but there are four pairs possible (row0+5, row1+6, row2+7, row3+8). However, in the output examples, sometimes there are four rows. For example, in Example0's output, there are four rows total (including the first 3s row). Wait, no, Example0's output has four rows: the first is [3,3,3,3], then three more. So the three additional rows are formed by pairing row1 with row6, row2 with row7, row3 with row8. What about row0 with row5?\n\nBut in Example0, row0 is [1,1,0,0] and row5 is [2,2,2,2]. Their sum would be 3,3,2,2 \u2192 converted to [3,3,3,3]. But that's not present in the output. Wait, the output of Example0 has four rows. The first is the 3s from the 4s row, then three more. So perhaps only three pairs are made, possibly skipping row0+5. Or maybe there's another pattern.\n\nWait, looking at the outputs of all examples:\n\nExample0: output has four rows. First is [3,3,3,3], then three more. So three pairs.\n\nExample1: output has four rows. First [3,3,3,3], then three more. So total four rows.\n\nWait, perhaps the output consists of the transformed 4s row plus three other rows formed by combining rows from the first and second groups. But how are these three rows selected?\n\nLooking at the number of output rows across examples:\n\nEach output has four rows. The first is [3,3,3,3] (from the 4s row), then three more. So perhaps the three other rows are formed by combining the first three rows of the first group with the first three rows of the second group. But in Example0, the second group has four rows (5-8), so perhaps row5, row6, row7 are used, and row8 is ignored? Or perhaps rows5-8 are paired with rows1-3 of the first group.\n\nWait, in Example0, the three additional output rows are:\n\n[0,3,3,3] \u2192 row1 + row6.\n\n[3,3,0,0] \u2192 row2 + row7.\n\n[3,0,3,3] \u2192 row3 + row8.\n\nSo the pairs are (row1, row6), (row2, row7), (row3, row8). But what about row0 and row5? Maybe row0 and row5 are not used. But why?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the first group's row0 is combined with the second group's row5, but that output row is not present. But in Example0's output, there are four rows: the first is the 4s row, then three. So perhaps the first group's rows1-3 are paired with the second group's rows6-8. But rows6-8 are three rows. So each pair is row1+6, row2+7, row3+8. That seems to fit.\n\nSo the pattern is:\n\n- The fifth input row (all 4s) is converted to [3,3,3,3] by subtracting 1.\n\n- The next three output rows are formed by pairing the first group's rows1,2,3 with the second group's rows6,7,8 respectively. For each pair, sum the corresponding elements. If the sum is >=1, set to 3; otherwise, 0.\n\nWait, let's check this with Example1.\n\nExample1's input:\n\nFirst group (rows0-3):\n\nRow0: [1,1,1,0]\n\nRow1: [0,1,0,1]\n\nRow2: [0,0,1,1]\n\nRow3: [1,1,0,1]\n\nSecond group (rows5-8):\n\nRow5: [0,0,0,2]\n\nRow6: [0,0,0,2]\n\nRow7: [2,2,2,2]\n\nRow8: [2,2,0,2]\n\nOutput after the initial 3s:\n\n[0,3,0,3]\n\n[3,3,3,3]\n\n[3,3,0,3]\n\nSo according to the pattern:\n\nPair row1 (0,1,0,1) with row6 (0,0,0,2):\n\nSum each element:\n\n0+0=0 \u2192 0\n\n1+0=1 \u21923\n\n0+0=0 \u21920\n\n1+2=3 \u21923\n\nSo output row [0,3,0,3]. Which matches the second output row.\n\nPair row2 (0,0,1,1) with row7 (2,2,2,2):\n\n0+2=2 \u21923\n\n0+2=2 \u21923\n\n1+2=3 \u21923\n\n1+2=3 \u21923 \u2192 output [3,3,3,3]. Which matches the third output row.\n\nPair row3 (1,1,0,1) with row8 (2,2,0,2):\n\n1+2=3 \u21923\n\n1+2=3 \u21923\n\n0+0=0 \u21920\n\n1+2=3 \u21923 \u2192 output [3,3,0,3]. Which matches the fourth output row.\n\nYes, this fits. So the pattern seems to be:\n\n- The fifth input row (all 4s) is transformed into [3,3,3,3].\n\n- For the next three output rows, pair the first group's rows1,2,3 with the second group's rows6,7,8. For each element in the paired rows, if the sum is greater than zero, set to 3; otherwise, 0.\n\nBut wait, in Example0, the second group's rows are rows5-8, but in the pairing, row6 is used with row1, row7 with row2, row8 with row3. So the second group's rows are shifted by one. So the first group's row1 pairs with the second group's row6, which is the second row in the second group (since row5 is the first of the second group). So the pairing is first group row i (1-3) with second group row i+5 (6,7,8).\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Convert the fifth input row (index4) to [3,3,3,3].\n\n2. For i from 1 to 3 (first group rows 1,2,3), pair with second group rows i+5 (6,7,8). So for i=1, pair with row6; i=2 with row7; i=3 with row8.\n\n3. For each element in the paired rows, sum them. If the sum is >=1, output 3; else 0.\n\nNow let's check another example to confirm.\n\nExample2's input:\n\nFirst group:\n\nRow0: [1,1,0,0]\n\nRow1: [1,0,1,0]\n\nRow2: [1,1,0,1]\n\nRow3: [1,1,1,1]\n\nSecond group:\n\nRow5: [2,2,0,2]\n\nRow6: [0,0,2,0]\n\nRow7: [0,2,0,0]\n\nRow8: [2,0,2,0]\n\nOutput after the initial 3s:\n\n[3,3,0,3]\n\n[3,0,3,0]\n\n[3,3,0,3]\n\n[3,3,3,3]\n\nWait, the output is four rows. The first is the 3s from the 4s, then three more. Wait, the output here has four rows total, including the initial 3s. So according to the pattern, the first output row is [3,3,3,3], then the next three are the pairs of rows1-3 with rows6-8.\n\nSo:\n\nPair row1 (1,0,1,0) with row6 (0,0,2,0):\n\nSum:1+0=1 \u21923; 0+0=0 \u21920; 1+2=3 \u21923; 0+0=0 \u21920 \u2192 [3,0,3,0]. Which matches the second output row.\n\nPair row2 (1,1,0,1) with row7 (0,2,0,0):\n\nSum:1+0=1 \u21923; 1+2=3 \u21923; 0+0=0 \u21920; 1+0=1 \u21923 \u2192 [3,3,0,3]. Which matches the third output row.\n\nPair row3 (1,1,1,1) with row8 (2,0,2,0):\n\nSum:1+2=3 \u21923; 1+0=1 \u21923; 1+2=3 \u21923; 1+0=1 \u21923 \u2192 [3,3,3,3]. Which matches the fourth output row.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nNow, applying this pattern to the test input.\n\nTest Input:\n\n[1,0,1,0] \u2192 row0\n\n[1,0,1,0] \u2192 row1\n\n[0,1,0,0] \u2192 row2\n\n[1,0,1,0] \u2192 row3\n\n[4,4,4,4] \u2192 row4\n\n[2,2,0,0] \u2192 row5\n\n[0,0,2,0] \u2192 row6\n\n[0,2,0,2] \u2192 row7\n\n[2,2,2,0] \u2192 row8\n\nFollowing the pattern:\n\n1. The fifth row (row4) is converted to [3,3,3,3].\n\n2. Pair first group's rows1,2,3 with second group's rows6,7,8.\n\nSo:\n\n- Pair row1 (1,0,1,0) with row6 (0,0,2,0):\n\nSum each element:\n\n1+0=1 \u21923\n\n0+0=0 \u21920\n\n1+2=3 \u21923\n\n0+0=0 \u21920\n\nResult: [3,0,3,0]\n\n- Pair row2 (0,1,0,0) with row7 (0,2,0,2):\n\nSum:\n\n0+0=0 \u21920\n\n1+2=3 \u21923\n\n0+0=0 \u21920\n\n0+2=2 \u21923\n\nResult: [0,3,0,3]\n\n- Pair row3 (1,0,1,0) with row8 (2,2,2,0):\n\nSum:\n\n1+2=3 \u21923\n\n0+2=2 \u21923\n\n1+2=3 \u21923\n\n0+0=0 \u21920\n\nResult: [3,3,3,0]\n\nSo the output should be:\n\n[3,3,3,3]\n\n[3,0,3,0]\n\n[0,3,0,3]\n\n[3,3,3,0]\n\nBut let's look at the training examples' outputs. For example, in Example3's output, the last row is [0,3,3,3], which is when row3 (0,1,0,1) is paired with row8 (0,0,2,0), sum gives 0,1,2,1 \u2192 [3,3,3,3]. But maybe the pairing is rows1-3 with rows5-7 instead of 6-8. Wait, no, in Example3, the second group's rows5-8 are [2,2,0,0], [0,0,2,0], [2,2,0,0], [0,0,2,0]. Pairing row1 (1,1,0,1) with row6 (0,0,2,0) gives sum 1,1,2,1 \u2192 all 3s. Which matches Example3's output second row [3,3,3,3].\n\nBut in the test input's case, the paired rows are row1 with row6, row2 with row7, row3 with row8.\n\nSo putting it all together, the test input's output would be:\n\nFirst row: [3,3,3,3]\n\nThen:\n\n[3,0,3,0]\n\n[0,3,0,3]\n\n[3,3,3,0]\n\nBut looking at the training examples, sometimes the output rows after the initial 3s are ordered differently. For example, Example3's output has:\n\n[3,3,3,0]\n\n[3,3,3,3]\n\n[3,3,3,3]\n\n[0,3,3,3]\n\nBut according to our pattern, it would be pairing rows1-3 with rows6-8, leading to those three rows. However, the order might be preserved based on the pairing sequence.\n\nSo the final output for the test input should be:\n\n[3,3,3,3]\n\n[3,0,3,0]\n\n[0,3,0,3]\n\n[3,3,3,0]\n\nBut let's check if this matches the training examples' formatting. The outputs in the training examples sometimes have varying numbers of 0s and 3s. For example, in Example3's output, the first row after the 3s is [3,3,3,0], which is row1 paired with row6. So the order of the output rows after the initial 3s is row1, row2, row3.\n\nYes, the test output should follow the same order. Thus, the final answer should be:\n\n[3,3,3,3]\n\n[3,0,3,0]\n\n[0,3,0,3]\n\n[3,3,3,0]"
