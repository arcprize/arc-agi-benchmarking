        "cot_1": "Okay, let's tackle this puzzle. So, there are these training examples where an input matrix is transformed into an output array. I need to figure out the pattern here.\n\nLooking at Example 0:\n\nInput:\n[0, 0, 0]\n[1, 0, 0]\n[0, 1, 0]\n\nOutput: [1, 1]\n\nHmm. The output has two 1s. Let me see where those come from. In the input matrix, the non-zero elements are 1 (in the second row first column) and 1 (third row second column). So maybe each non-zero element contributes to the output. But wait, the output is [1,1], which are the same as the values. So perhaps the output is the list of non-zero elements, but ordered in a certain way.\n\nExample 1:\n\nInput:\n[0, 2, 0]\n[2, 0, 0]\n[0, 2, 0]\n\nOutput: [2, 2, 2]\n\nThe non-zero elements here are 2 (first row second column), 2 (second row first column), and 2 (third row second column). So the output lists all three 2s. So maybe the output is just all non-zero elements, but in some order. But in example 0, there are two 1s and the output has two 1s, so that fits. But example 0's output is [1,1], same order as the non-zero elements when read row-wise? Let's check:\n\nFirst row: 0,0,0 (no non-zero). Second row: 1,0,0 (non-zero is 1). Third row: 0,1,0 (non-zero is 1). So the output is [1,1], which matches. So example 0's output is the non-zero elements in row-major order (left to right, top to bottom). Let's check other examples.\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput:\n[0,7,0]\n[0,0,0]\n[0,0,0]\n\nOutput: [7]\n\nOnly one non-zero, which is 7. The output is [7], which fits. So that's straightforward.\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput:\n[0,8,0]\n[8,8,0]\n[8,0,0]\n\nOutput: [8,8,8,8]\n\nNon-zero elements: first row has 8 (second column), second row has 8 (first and second columns), third row has 8 (first column). So that's four 8s. The output is [8,8,8,8], which matches. So the pattern seems to be taking all the non-zero elements in row-major order and putting them into the output array.\n\nWait, but in example 0, the output is [1,1], which is exactly the two non-zero elements. Similarly, example 3 has four 8s. So yes, the output is all non-zero elements in order, ignoring zeros.\n\nBut wait, let's check the test input:\n\nTest Input:\n[4,4,0]\n[4,0,4]\n[0,0,4]\n\nSo let's list the non-zero elements row-wise. First row: 4,4. Second row:4,4. Third row:4. So the non-zero elements in order are 4,4,4,4,4. So the output should be [4,4,4,4,4].\n\nBut wait, the outputs in the examples:\n\nExample 0's output is two 1s. The input had 1 and 1. So the output counts each non-zero element once. So for the test input, the output would be five 4s. But let's see the training examples again. Wait, in example 3, the input has four non-zero elements (all 8s), and the output is four 8s. So that matches. So the pattern is simply collecting all the non-zero elements in row-major order (left to right, top to bottom) and listing them in the output.\n\nSo applying that to the test input:\n\nFirst row: 4,4,0 \u2192 two 4s.\nSecond row:4,0,4 \u2192 two 4s.\nThird row:0,0,4 \u2192 one 4.\nTotal of 2+2+1=5 elements. So the output should be [4,4,4,4,4].\n\nBut let me check if there's any other pattern. For example, maybe the output is the sum of each column or something else. Wait, example 0: columns are 0+1+0=1, 0+0+1=1, 0+0+0=0. Output is [1,1], which matches the sums of columns 1 and 2. Wait, that's a possibility. Let's check other examples.\n\nExample1 input:\n\nColumns:\n0+2+0=2 (column 1)\n2+0+2=4 (column 2)\n0+0+0=0 (column 3)\nBut the output is [2,2,2], which doesn't match the column sums (2,4,0). So that can't be.\n\nAnother idea: Maybe the output is the diagonal elements. Example0: rows are [0,0,0], [1,0,0], [0,1,0]. Diagonals (0,0,0) \u2192 but output is [1,1]. So no.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's the count of non-zero elements per row. But example0 has rows with 0,1,1 non-zero. But output is [1,1], which is two elements, not matching counts.\n\nWait, maybe the output is the sum of each row, but only if the sum is non-zero. Let's see example0:\n\nRow1 sum:0 \u2192 not included. Row2 sum:1 \u2192 included. Row3 sum:1 \u2192 included. Output [1,1]. That fits. Example1: row sums are 2 (row1), 2 (row2), 2 (row3). Output [2,2,2]. That fits. Example2: row sums 7,0,0 \u2192 output [7]. Example3: row1 sum 8, row2 sum 16, row3 sum 8. But output is [8,8,8,8]. Wait, no. Because the row sums would be 8 (row1: 0+8+0=8), row2: 8+8+0=16, row3:8+0+0=8. So output would be [8,16,8], but the actual output is [8,8,8,8]. So that doesn't fit. So this theory is invalid.\n\nSo back to original idea: the output is all the non-zero elements in row-major order. Let's check example3. Input:\n\nRow1: [0,8,0] \u2192 8\nRow2: [8,8,0] \u2192 8,8\nRow3: [8,0,0] \u21928\nSo the non-zero elements are 8,8,8,8. Output is [8,8,8,8]. Correct.\n\nTest input:\n\nRow1:4,4,0 \u2192 4,4\nRow2:4,0,4 \u21924,4\nRow3:0,0,4 \u21924\nSo non-zero elements in order:4,4,4,4,4. So output should be [4,4,4,4,4].\n\nBut let's check the examples again. Example0's input is three rows, each with three elements. The non-zero elements are in row2 (1) and row3 (1). So the output is [1,1], which matches the order. So yes, the pattern is to collect all non-zero elements in the order they appear, row by row, left to right, top to bottom.\n\nTherefore, the test input's output is [4,4,4,4,4].",

        "cot_2": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. So, looking at the training examples, each input is a 3x3 grid (or maybe 3 rows of varying lengths?), and the output is a list. Let's go through each example one by one.\n\nStarting with Example 0:\n\nInput:\n[0, 0, 0]\n[1, 0, 0]\n[0, 1, 0]\n\nOutput: [1, 1]\n\nHmm. The output has two 1s. Let me see where the non-zero numbers are in the input. The second row has a 1 in the first position, third row has a 1 in the second position. So maybe it's combining those non-zero elements? But the output has two 1s. So maybe it's the count of non-zero elements in each column? Wait, columns:\n\nFor example 0:\n\nColumns would be:\nFirst column: 0,1,0 \u2192 sum is 1\nSecond column: 0,0,1 \u2192 sum is 1\nThird column: 0,0,0 \u2192 sum 0\nBut output is [1,1], which is two elements. Wait, that doesn't fit. Maybe it's the sum of each column but ignoring zeros? But then example 0's sum would be 1 and 1, but how does that turn into [1,1]? Maybe just the non-zero sums. So columns 1 and 2 have sum 1 each, so output is [1,1]. That fits.\n\nLet's check example 1:\n\nInput:\n[0, 2, 0]\n[2, 0, 0]\n[0, 2, 0]\n\nColumns:\n\nFirst column: 0,2,0 \u2192 sum 2\nSecond column: 2,0,2 \u2192 sum 4\nThird column: 0,0,0 \u2192 sum 0\nBut output is [2,2,2]. Wait, that doesn't match. Because sum of first column is 2, second 4. So maybe not the sum. Alternatively, maybe each column's maximum value? Let's see.\n\nExample 0: columns max values are 1,1,0. Output is [1,1], which skips the third column. So maybe it's the maximum of each column, but only including columns where there's a non-zero maximum. So example 0's third column is all zeros, so it's excluded. So output would be the max of each column that has at least one non-zero. That would make example 0's output [1,1], which matches. Example 1's columns have max 2, 2, 0. So output [2,2], but the actual output is [2,2,2]. Hmm, that doesn't fit. Wait the output for example1 is [2,2,2]. Let me check the input again. Wait the input for example1 is:\n\nRow1: [0,2,0]\nRow2: [2,0,0]\nRow3: [0,2,0]\n\nSo columns are:\n\nColumn1: 0,2,0 \u2192 max 2\nColumn2: 2,0,2 \u2192 max 2\nColumn3: 0,0,0 \u2192 max 0\nBut output is [2,2,2]. So that can't be. Unless maybe it's not columns. Maybe rows? Let's check.\n\nExample0's rows are [0,0,0], [1,0,0], [0,1,0]. The output is [1,1]. If taking non-zero elements from each row, but only once? The second row has 1, third has 1. So output is those numbers. But example1's output would be 2,2,2 from each row's non-zero elements. But example1's input has three rows with 2 each. So output would be [2,2,2]. Which matches example1's output. So maybe the pattern is taking all the non-zero elements from each row, in order, and concatenating them. Let's check.\n\nExample0: non-zero elements are 1 (from row2) and 1 (row3). So output [1,1]. That fits.\n\nExample1: each row has a 2, then 2, then 2. So output [2,2,2]. Yes.\n\nExample2: input is [0,7,0], [0,0,0], [0,0,0]. Non-zero elements only 7 in first row. So output [7]. Correct.\n\nExample3: rows are [0,8,0], [8,8,0], [8,0,0]. Non-zero elements are 8 (row1), 8,8 (row2), 8 (row3). So concatenated as [8,8,8,8]. Which matches the output.\n\nSo the pattern seems to be: for each row in the input, collect all the non-zero elements in order, then concatenate them all into a single list. That's the output.\n\nTesting the test input:\n\nTest input:\n\n[4,4,0]\n[4,0,4]\n[0,0,4]\n\nEach row's non-zero elements:\n\nRow1: 4,4\n\nRow2:4,4\n\nRow3:4\n\nSo concatenated, output should be [4,4,4,4,4]. Wait but wait:\n\nRow1: 4,4 (since third element is 0)\n\nRow2:4 (first element), then 4 (third element) \u2192 [4,4]\n\nRow3:4 (third element)\n\nSo combining all non-zero elements in order: [4,4,4,4,4] \u2192 which is five 4s. But let's check. Let's list each row's non-zero elements:\n\nRow1: elements are [4,4,0] \u2192 non-zero are 4,4.\n\nRow2: [4,0,4] \u2192 non-zero 4,4.\n\nRow3: [0,0,4] \u2192 non-zero 4.\n\nSo concatenated: [4,4,4,4,4], which is five elements. But according to the training examples, example3's output is four 8s. Which makes sense because the rows have [8], [8,8], [8], total four 8s.\n\nSo applying the same logic to the test input, the output should be [4,4,4,4,4]. But let's check the possible mistakes. Wait, in the test input:\n\nRow1: 4,4,0 \u2192 non-zero elements: 4,4.\n\nRow2:4,0,4 \u2192 non-zero: 4,4.\n\nRow3:0,0,4 \u2192 non-zero:4.\n\nSo the concatenated list is 4,4,4,4,4. So five elements. But looking at the examples, example1's output is three 2s because each row contributes one 2, but wait no, example1's input rows each have one 2. Wait, row1 has [0,2,0], which is one 2. Row2 has [2,0,0], one 2. Row3 has [0,2,0], one 2. So three 2s in the output. So yes, the pattern is correct.\n\nThus, the test input's output should be [4,4,4,4,4]. But let me check again.\n\nYes, the test input's rows have:\n\nRow1: two 4s.\n\nRow2: two 4s.\n\nRow3: one 4.\n\nTotal 2+2+1 =5 elements. So the output should be a list of five 4s. So [4,4,4,4,4]."
