        "cot_1": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. So, we have these training examples where a 3x3 input matrix is transformed into a 9x9 output matrix. Let me look at the first example first.\n\nIn Example 0, the input is:\n\n[3, 3, 0]\n[7, 4, 0]\n[0, 0, 4]\n\nThe output is a 9x9 grid. Let me see how each element in the input corresponds to the output. For instance, the first element of the input is 3. Looking at the output's first three rows and first six columns, they are all 3s. Then the next three columns are 0s. Similarly, the next three rows (4th to 6th) start with 7s, then 4s, then 0s. The last three rows have 0s followed by 4s. \n\nWait, maybe each element in the input matrix is being expanded into a 3x3 block in the output, but arranged in a way that combines them? Let me check the positions. The original 3x3 input matrix could be divided into blocks. For example, the input element at (0,0) is 3. In the output, the first three rows and first three columns are 3s, but then they extend further. Wait, in the first three rows of the output, the first six columns are 3s. Hmm. That's 6 columns, which is 2 times 3. Maybe each element in the input is being replicated into a 3x3 block, but then arranged in a larger grid where each input element's block is placed in a position that's scaled up by 3. But that would make the output 3x3 blocks arranged 3x3, leading to 9x9. But how do the original positions map?\n\nAlternatively, maybe each element in the input is being split into a 3x3 block, but the value is replicated in a certain pattern. Let's see. For example, in the first input row [3,3,0], the output's first three rows have three 3s followed by three 3s, then three 0s. Wait, that's three elements each repeated three times. So for the first row of the input, each element is repeated three times in a row, and this is done for three rows. Then for the next input row, same thing. But how are they arranged in the output?\n\nWait, looking at Example 0's input:\n\nRow 0: 3,3,0\n\nIn the output, the first three rows start with six 3s (3 repeated three times, then 3 again three times?), then three 0s. Wait, the first three rows of the output are [3,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,0]. So each input element is expanded into a 3x3 block? Wait, the first input element (3) becomes a 3x3 block of 3s, but then the next element (3) also becomes a 3x3 block of 3s, and the third element (0) becomes 0s. But arranged side by side. Wait, but each input element's block is 3 columns wide. So for each row in the input, each element is converted into a 3x3 block where each block is 3 columns wide and 3 rows tall, but the same element is repeated in that block. Then, the output is the concatenation of these blocks, row-wise. But how does that lead to the output structure?\n\nWait, let's take the first input row [3,3,0]. If each element is a 3x3 block, then the first row would have three such blocks horizontally. But in the output, the first three rows have the first two elements (3,3) each as a block of 3x3, but then the third element (0) as a 3x3 block. Wait, no. Because in the output, the first three rows have 3s for the first six columns (3*2=6?), then three 0s. So maybe each input element is converted into a 3x3 block, but the blocks are stacked horizontally for the same row. But then, how does the vertical arrangement work? Because each input row would produce three rows (since each block is 3 rows tall). So for the first input row, each element's block is 3 columns wide and 3 rows tall. So the first input row would generate three output rows, each consisting of the three blocks (each 3 columns) concatenated horizontally. Then the next input row would generate another three output rows, etc. But in Example 0, the input is 3x3, and the output is 9x9. So each input row becomes three rows in the output, and each input column becomes three columns in the output. So each cell (i,j) in the input becomes a 3x3 block in the output starting at row 3i, column 3j. But looking at Example 0's output:\n\nLooking at the first input element [0,0] which is 3. In the output, the first three rows (0-2) and first three columns (0-2) would be 3s. But in the actual output, the first three rows have 3s for the first six columns, then 0s. Wait, that's not matching. Maybe the input is being processed in a different way.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each input element determines a 3x3 block in the output, but the value is replicated in that block. But the arrangement is such that the input matrix is scaled up by a factor of 3, so each input cell becomes a 3x3 cell in the output. For example, input cell (i,j) becomes output cells (3i,3j) to (3i+2,3j+2) filled with the value. But in Example 0, the output's first three rows and first six columns are all 3s. Wait, that would be 3 columns for the first input element (3,3,0) first row first element. But the output's first three rows have six 3s. Hmm, perhaps each input row's elements are each expanded to three columns, and the entire input row is expanded into three rows where each element's value is repeated three times in a row. Then, each input row becomes three output rows, each consisting of the three input elements repeated three times. But how does that fit with the example?\n\nLooking at Example 0's input first row [3,3,0]. If each element is repeated three times per row, then each output row for this input row would be [3,3,3, 3,3,3, 0,0,0]. Then, this row is repeated three times. So the first three rows of the output are three copies of that. Then the next three rows correspond to the second input row [7,4,0], so each row would be [7,7,7,4,4,4,0,0,0], repeated three times. The last three rows are [0,0,0,0,0,0,4,4,4], which comes from the third input row [0,0,4]. So each element in the input row is repeated three times in sequence, forming a row of 9 elements. Then each input row is turned into three identical output rows. Then, the output is generated by taking each row of the input, expanding each element into three copies in a row, and then tripling the row vertically (three times). \n\nSo for example, the input row [3,3,0] becomes a row [3,3,3, 3,3,3, 0,0,0], and then this row is written three times in the output. Then the next input row does the same, etc. That would make the output rows 3 times the input rows, both in length (each element becomes 3 copies) and in height (each input row becomes 3 output rows).\n\nYes, that seems to fit. Let's check Example 1:\n\nInput row 0 is [3,0,2]. The first three output rows are [3,3,3,0,0,0,2,2,2], each repeated three times. Then the next input row [0,2,2] becomes [0,0,0,2,2,2,2,2,2], repeated three times. Third input row [0,0,3] becomes [0,0,0,0,0,0,3,3,3], repeated three times. \n\nSo the pattern is: For each row in the input, create a new row where each element is repeated three times in sequence. Then, repeat that new row three times in the output. \n\nSo the transformation steps are:\n\n1. Take each row of the input matrix.\n2. For each element in the row, repeat it three times consecutively to form a segment.\n3. Concatenate these segments for the entire row to form a new row of length 9 (since 3 elements each repeated thrice: 3*3=9).\n4. Repeat this new row three times in the output matrix.\n\nThus, each input row becomes three identical rows in the output, each of which is the input row elements each repeated three times.\n\nNow, applying this to the test input:\n\nTest Input:\n\n[0,1,0]\n[0,0,6]\n[6,1,0]\n\nLet's process each row.\n\nFirst row: [0,1,0]\n\nExpand each element to three copies: 0,0,0 followed by 1,1,1 followed by 0,0,0. So the new row is [0,0,0, 1,1,1, 0,0,0]. Then repeat this row three times.\n\nSecond input row: [0,0,6]\n\nExpanding each element: 0,0,0 (for 0) then 0,0,0 (for 0) then 6,6,6. So the row is [0,0,0, 0,0,0, 6,6,6]. Repeat three times.\n\nThird input row: [6,1,0]\n\nExpanding each element: 6,6,6 followed by 1,1,1 followed by 0,0,0. So the row is [6,6,6, 1,1,1, 0,0,0]. Repeat three times.\n\nPutting it all together, the output matrix should have:\n\nFirst three rows: [0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0] x3\n\nNext three rows: [0,0,0,0,0,0,6,6,6] x3\n\nLast three rows: [6,6,6,1,1,1,0,0,0] x3\n\nSo the final output would be:\n\n[0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0]\n[0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0]\n[0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0]\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,6,6,6]\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,6,6,6]\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,6,6,6]\n[6,6,6,1,1,1,0,0,0]\n[6,6,6,1,1,1,0,0,0]\n[6,6,6,1,1,1,0,0,0]\n\nYes, that seems to fit the pattern.",

        "cot_2": "Okay, I need to figure out the pattern here. Let's look at the training examples.\n\nStarting with Example 0:\n\nInput is a 3x3 matrix:\n[3, 3, 0]\n[7, 4, 0]\n[0, 0, 4]\n\nOutput is a 9x9 matrix. Wait, no, looking closer, the output has 9 rows, each with 9 elements. So it's a 9x9 grid. How did they get from 3x3 to 9x9?\n\nLooking at the output for example 0:\n\nThe first three rows are all [3,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,0]. Then next three rows start with 7,7,7 then 4,4,4, then zeros. Then the last three rows are zeros followed by 4,4,4.\n\nHmm. Wait, maybe each element in the input matrix is being expanded into a 3x3 block. Let's check. The original matrix is 3x3, and the output is 9x9, which is 3 times each dimension. So each input cell becomes a 3x3 block in the output.\n\nBut how are the values determined? Let's see:\n\nIn the first input row of example 0: [3,3,0]. The first element is 3, so in the output, the first three rows have the first three elements as 3 repeated three times, then three times 3 again? Wait, the output's first three rows are all [3,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,0]. Wait, that's six 3s followed by three 0s. So perhaps each element in the input is expanded into a 3x3 block, but also multiplied by the row and column positions?\n\nWait maybe each element (i,j) in the input becomes a block in the output. The input is 3x3. The output is 3x3 blocks arranged into 9x9. So each input cell becomes a 3x3 block in the output. The value in the output block depends on the original cell's value and possibly its position.\n\nLooking at example 0's input:\n\nFirst row is 3,3,0. The first two cells are 3 and 3, third is 0. In the output, the top-left 3x3 block (rows 0-2, columns 0-2) would be 3s. Then the next block (columns 3-5) would be 3s? Wait the first three rows of the output have 6 3s. Wait 3 elements in the input's first row, each turned into 3 columns? Maybe each input element is expanded into a 3x3 block, but arranged in a way that the first input row's elements are each stretched horizontally and vertically?\n\nWait perhaps the output is constructed by replacing each input element with a 3x3 block where all elements are the same as the input element. Then arrange these blocks in the same order. But example 0's input first row is [3,3,0], so their blocks would be 3,3,0 each as 3x3. So the first three rows of the output would be the concatenation of these three blocks. But in the output, the first three rows are [3,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,0], which is 3 repeated 6 times and 0 3 times. Wait that's 3+3+3 elements. Wait wait, each input element becomes a 3x3 block. So for the first row of input [3,3,0], each element is 3,3,0. So their blocks are 3x3 of 3, 3x3 of 3, 3x3 of 0. When you lay them out horizontally, each block is 3 columns. So for each row in the input, each element's block is 3x3. So when you lay out the first row's three blocks side by side, each block is 3 columns. So the combined row would be 3+3+3=9 columns. Then each input row's blocks are stacked three times (since each block is 3 rows tall). So for input row 0, the three blocks (3,3,0) each become 3 columns, so the first three rows of the output would be each of these blocks stacked. Wait no, the first three rows of the output in example 0 are each the same: [3,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,0]. That suggests that each input element's block is being replicated three times in the rows. Wait, but each input element's block is 3 rows tall. So for example, the first input row [3,3,0] would generate three blocks (each 3x3) arranged horizontally. Then, each of those blocks contributes 3 rows. So the first three rows of the output are the first row of each block? Wait, perhaps not. Alternatively, each input element's block is placed in a grid. Let's think in terms of the output being a 3x3 grid of 3x3 blocks.\n\nWait, the input is 3x3, and the output is 9x9, which is 3x3 blocks each of size 3x3. So each input cell (i,j) corresponds to a block in the output at position (i*3, j*3) of size 3x3. Then, the value of that block is filled with the input value.\n\nBut looking at example 0's input first element (0,0) is 3. So the block at (0-2, 0-2) would be 3s. The next element (0,1) is 3, so the block (0-2, 3-5) is 3s. Then (0,2) is 0, block (0-2,6-8) is 0s. Then input row 1: 7,4,0. So the blocks for row 1 are at (3-5, 0-2) for 7, (3-5,3-5) for 4, and (3-5,6-8) for 0. Similarly, row 2: 0,0,4, so blocks at (6-8,0-2) 0, (6-8,3-5) 0, (6-8,6-8) 4.\n\nSo in the output, each input cell (i,j) becomes a 3x3 block in the output starting at row i*3 and column j*3. The entire block is filled with the input value.\n\nLooking at example 0's output, that's exactly the case. The first three rows (0-2) in columns 0-2 are 3s (from input cell 0,0), columns 3-5 are 3s (from input cell 0,1), and 6-8 are 0s (input cell 0,2). Then rows 3-5, columns 0-2 are 7s (input cell 1,0), columns 3-5 are 4s (input cell 1,1), etc. So that seems correct.\n\nNow, check example 1's input and output.\n\nInput is:\n[3, 0, 2]\n[0, 2, 2]\n[0, 0, 3]\n\nOutput is a 9x9 matrix where the first three rows are 3s in the first block (columns 0-2), 0s in the next (columns3-5), and 2s in the third (columns6-8). Then rows 3-5 are 0s, 2s, 2s. Then rows6-8 are 0s, 0s, 3s.\n\nYes, each input cell becomes a 3x3 block. So the pattern is: each element in the input matrix is replaced by a 3x3 block of the same value, arranged in the same grid. So the output is a 3x3 tiling of 3x3 blocks, each corresponding to the input's elements.\n\nSo the test input is:\n\n[0,1,0]\n[0,0,6]\n[6,1,0]\n\nEach element becomes a 3x3 block. Let's map it out.\n\nFirst input row [0,1,0]. So the first three rows of the output will have:\n\nColumns 0-2: 0 (from input 0,0)\nColumns3-5: 1 (input 0,1)\nColumns6-8:0 (input 0,2)\n\nSo the first three rows of the output are [0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0], repeated three times each.\n\nSecond input row [0,0,6]. So rows3-5:\n\nColumns0-2:0 (input1,0)\nColumns3-5:0 (input1,1)\nColumns6-8:6 (input1,2)\n\nEach of these blocks is 3x3. So rows3-5 will have three rows each of [0,0,0,0,0,0,6,6,6].\n\nThird input row [6,1,0]. So rows6-8:\n\nColumns0-2:6 (input2,0)\nColumns3-5:1 (input2,1)\nColumns6-8:0 (input2,2)\n\nEach block here is 3x3. So rows6-8 are three times [6,6,6,1,1,1,0,0,0].\n\nPutting it all together, the output should be:\n\nFor rows 0-2:\n[0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0]\nrepeated three times.\n\nRows3-5:\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,6,6,6]\nthree times.\n\nRows6-8:\n[6,6,6,1,1,1,0,0,0]\nthree times.\n\nLet me check if this matches the training examples. Yes, in example1, the third row of input was [0,0,3], so the output's last three rows are three copies of [0,0,0,0,0,0,3,3,3], which aligns with this pattern.\n\nTherefore, applying this to the test input should produce the correct output."
