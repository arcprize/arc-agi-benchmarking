        "cot_1": "Okay, let's tackle this puzzle. So, the task is to figure out the transformation pattern from the given training examples and apply it to the test input. Let's start by looking at the training examples to spot any patterns.\n\nFirst, Example 0:\nInput is a 3x3 grid:\n[0, 7, 0]\n[0, 0, 7]\n[0, 7, 7]\n\nOutput becomes a 3x6 grid. Hmm, so the output has double the columns. Let me look at each row. The first input row [0,7,0] becomes [0,7,0,0,7,0]. Wait, it looks like the original row is mirrored but with some modification. Let me check. The original row is 0,7,0. When mirrored, it would be 0,7,0,0,7,0. But the mirroring here seems like the original row followed by its reverse. Wait, original is [0,7,0], reverse is [0,7,0], so combining gives the same as original? That can't be right. Wait, no. Wait, maybe it's the original row followed by the reverse of that row. Let's see. For the first row of Example 0, the input is [0,7,0]. Reverse of that is [0,7,0], so combined it's [0,7,0,0,7,0], which matches the output. But that's the same as the original. So maybe that's not the pattern.\n\nLooking at the second row of Example 0: input [0,0,7]. Output [0,0,7,7,0,0]. If we take the original row and append its reverse, the reverse of [0,0,7] is [7,0,0], so combining gives [0,0,7,7,0,0], which matches the output. Oh, right! So each row is concatenated with its reversed version. Let me check the third row. Input [0,7,7], reversed is [7,7,0], so combined would be [0,7,7,7,7,0], which matches the output. So that seems to be the pattern here. Each row in the output is the original row followed by its reverse.\n\nWait, but let's check Example 1. Input is:\n[0,0,0]\n[0,7,7]\n[0,0,0]\n\nOutput:\n[0,0,0,0,0,0]\n[0,7,7,7,7,0]\n[0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nSo first row input is [0,0,0]. Reverse is same, so output is [0,0,0,0,0,0]. That works. Second row input [0,7,7], reversed is [7,7,0]. So combining gives [0,7,7,7,7,0]. Wait, but the output here is [0,7,7,7,7,0]. Wait, the original is [0,7,7], reversed is [7,7,0], so when combined, the output should be [0,7,7,7,7,0], which matches. So yes, that's the pattern. So each row in the output is the original row concatenated with the reversed version of the same row.\n\nWait, but in Example 2:\n\nInput:\n[0,0,0]\n[7,0,0]\n[0,0,0]\n\nOutput:\n[0,0,0,0,0,0]\n[7,0,0,0,0,7]\n[0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nThe second row input is [7,0,0]. Reverse is [0,0,7], so combining gives [7,0,0,0,0,7], which matches the output. So yes, the pattern holds here as well.\n\nSo the transformation is: take each row of the input, append the reversed version of that row to itself, thereby doubling the number of columns from 3 to 6. So the output is each input row followed by its reverse.\n\nApplying this to the test input:\n\nTest Input:\n[7,7,0]\n[0,7,0]\n[0,0,7]\n\nLet's process each row.\n\nFirst row: [7,7,0]. Reverse is [0,7,7]. So combined becomes [7,7,0,0,7,7].\n\nWait, but let's check the examples again. Wait, in Example 0, the first row input is [0,7,0], reversed is [0,7,0], so output is [0,7,0,0,7,0]. So when the original and reversed are the same, the output is duplicated. So for the test input's first row: [7,7,0], reversed is [0,7,7]. So combined as [7,7,0,0,7,7].\n\nSecond row: [0,7,0]. Reversed is [0,7,0], so combined becomes [0,7,0,0,7,0].\n\nThird row: [0,0,7]. Reversed is [7,0,0]. So combined as [0,0,7,7,0,0].\n\nSo putting it all together, the output should be:\n\n[7,7,0,0,7,7]\n\n[0,7,0,0,7,0]\n\n[0,0,7,7,0,0]\n\nWait, but let me check if there's any other pattern. Looking at the training examples again. For example, in Example 0, the third row input is [0,7,7], reversed as [7,7,0], output is [0,7,7,7,7,0]. Wait, but when you reverse [0,7,7], you get [7,7,0]. So the output is [0,7,7] followed by [7,7,0]? Wait no, the output is [0,7,7,7,7,0]. Wait, that's not exactly the reversed. Wait the input row is [0,7,7]. Reversed would be [7,7,0]. So combining input and reversed would give [0,7,7,7,7,0]. Wait, no. [0,7,7] followed by reversed is [7,7,0], so combined would be [0,7,7,7,7,0], which matches the output. Wait, the reversed of the input row [0,7,7] is [7,7,0], right? Because reversing the elements. So yes. So the third row of example 0's output is correct.\n\nSo the pattern is: each row is followed by its reverse. So the test input should follow the same.\n\nSo the test input:\n\nRow 1: [7,7,0] \u2192 reversed is [0,7,7] \u2192 combined \u2192 [7,7,0,0,7,7]\n\nRow 2: [0,7,0] \u2192 reversed is [0,7,0] \u2192 combined \u2192 [0,7,0,0,7,0]\n\nRow 3: [0,0,7] \u2192 reversed is [7,0,0] \u2192 combined \u2192 [0,0,7,7,0,0]\n\nSo the output should be:\n\n[7,7,0,0,7,7]\n\n[0,7,0,0,7,0]\n\n[0,0,7,7,0,0]\n\nBut wait, let me check the training examples again. Let's look at Example 2's output:\n\nInput row [7,0,0] \u2192 reversed is [0,0,7] \u2192 combined becomes [7,0,0,0,0,7], which is the output. So yes, the same pattern.\n\nTherefore, applying this to the test input, the answer should be as I outlined above.",

        "cot_2": "Okay, let's tackle this puzzle. So, we need to figure out the pattern that transforms the 3x3 input matrices into 3x6 output matrices. Let me look at the training examples closely.\n\nStarting with Example 0. The input is three rows:\n\n[0,7,0]\n[0,0,7]\n[0,7,7]\n\nThe output is each row expanded to double the length. Let me see each row:\n\nFirst input row [0,7,0] becomes [0,7,0,0,7,0]. Hmm, so the original row is followed by a reversed version of the original but with some modification? Wait, original is 0,7,0. Then the added part is 0,7,0 again? Wait, no. Wait, original is three elements, output is six. So maybe mirroring. Let's check: the first output row is the original [0,7,0] followed by [0,7,0] reversed? Wait, reversing [0,7,0] would still be [0,7,0]. But that's not adding anything new. Wait, maybe it's mirrored but with some elements changed. Wait, the original row is followed by a reversed copy, but with the middle elements modified?\n\nLooking at Example 0's output:\n\nOriginal first row is [0,7,0], output is [0,7,0,0,7,0]. Wait, that's the original followed by [0,7,0], but the last element is 0 again. Wait, maybe it's the original row concatenated with a reversed version, but with the middle elements kept as 7. Or perhaps, for each row, after the original, we append a mirrored version but with some rules.\n\nLooking at Example 1's input:\n\nInput row [0,0,0] becomes [0,0,0,0,0,0]. So just repeating the same. The middle row input is [0,7,7], output is [0,7,7,7,7,0]. So original is [0,7,7], then the appended part starts with 7,7,0. Wait, the second half is the reverse of the original, but maybe replacing some elements. Let's see: [0,7,7] reversed is [7,7,0]. So the output row is original + reversed, but with the middle elements maintained. Wait, but in this case, original plus reversed gives [0,7,7,7,7,0], which is exactly what's there. So for this row, the output is the original followed by reversed original, but perhaps with the middle elements doubled?\n\nWait, original is three elements. When reversed, the three elements are added. But that would make 6 elements. Let me check:\n\nOriginal row in Example 0's first row is [0,7,0], reversed is [0,7,0], so concatenated gives [0,7,0,0,7,0], which matches the output. But in Example 1's middle row, original [0,7,7], reversed is [7,7,0], so concatenated gives [0,7,7,7,7,0], which matches. Similarly, the second example's input middle row is [7,0,0]. Reversed is [0,0,7]. So original plus reversed would be [7,0,0,0,0,7], which matches the output. Oh! So the pattern seems to be that each row in the output is the original row followed by its reverse. Let's test this hypothesis against all training examples.\n\nExample 0:\n\nOriginal rows:\nRow 0: [0,7,0] \u2192 reversed [0,7,0] \u2192 concatenated \u2192 [0,7,0,0,7,0] \u2192 matches output.\nRow 1: [0,0,7] \u2192 reversed [7,0,0] \u2192 concatenated [0,0,7,7,0,0] \u2192 matches output.\nRow 2: [0,7,7] \u2192 reversed [7,7,0] \u2192 concatenated [0,7,7,7,7,0] \u2192 matches output.\n\nYes, that works.\n\nExample 1:\n\nRow 0: [0,0,0] reversed \u2192 same, so concatenated gives [0,0,0,0,0,0] \u2192 matches.\nRow 1: [0,7,7] reversed [7,7,0] \u2192 concatenated \u2192 [0,7,7,7,7,0] \u2192 matches.\nRow 2: same as row 0.\n\nExample 2:\n\nMiddle row input [7,0,0] reversed \u2192 [0,0,7], concatenated gives [7,0,0,0,0,7] \u2192 matches output.\n\nSo the pattern is that each row in the output is the original row followed by its reversed version, making each row twice as long (3+3=6 elements). So for the test input, each of the three rows should be followed by their reversed versions.\n\nLet's test the test input:\n\nTest input rows:\nRow 0: [7,7,0] \u2192 reversed \u2192 [0,7,7] \u2192 concatenated \u2192 [7,7,0,0,7,7]\nRow 1: [0,7,0] \u2192 reversed \u2192 [0,7,0] \u2192 concatenated \u2192 [0,7,0,0,7,0]\nRow 2: [0,0,7] \u2192 reversed \u2192 [7,0,0] \u2192 concatenated \u2192 [0,0,7,7,0,0]\n\nWait, but let's check the training examples again. For example, in example 0's third row, input [0,7,7] becomes output [0,7,7,7,7,0]. Wait, but reversing [0,7,7] would give [7,7,0], so the concatenated row is [0,7,7] + [7,7,0] \u2192 [0,7,7,7,7,0], which is what's in the output. So yes, the reversed version is added.\n\nSo applying this pattern to the test input:\n\nTest input:\n\nRow 0: [7,7,0] \u2192 reversed is [0,7,7], so output row is [7,7,0,0,7,7]\nRow 1: [0,7,0] \u2192 reversed [0,7,0] \u2192 output [0,7,0,0,7,0]\nRow 2: [0,0,7] \u2192 reversed [7,0,0] \u2192 output [0,0,7,7,0,0]\n\nSo the output should be:\n\n[7,7,0,0,7,7]\n[0,7,0,0,7,0]\n[0,0,7,7,0,0]\n\nBut wait, looking at the training examples, for example, in Example 0's output, the third row is [0,7,7,7,7,0], which is [0,7,7] + [7,7,0]. So the reversed of [0,7,7] is indeed [7,7,0]. So the pattern is correct.\n\nTherefore, the test input's output should be each row concatenated with its reversed version."
