        "cot_1": "Okay, let's tackle this puzzle. Hmm, looking at the training examples, I need to figure out the pattern that transforms the input matrix into the output. Let me start by analyzing each example step by step.\n\nStarting with Example 0:\n\nInput:\n[0, 0, 6]\n[0, 4, 0]\n[3, 0, 0]\n\nOutput:\n[0, 0, 6]\n[0, 4, 6]\n[3, 4, 6]\n\nLooking at the changes here. The third row in input has 3,0,0. In the output, the third row becomes 3,4,6. Wait, the 4 and 6 must be coming from somewhere. Let's check the columns. The third column in the input is 6,0,0. Output third column is 6,6,6. Oh, so maybe each column is being filled with the maximum value from that column? Let me check.\n\nIn Example 0, column 1 (first column) has 0,0,3. Max is 3. But in the output, the first column becomes 0,0,3. So that's same. Wait, maybe not. Let's check the rows. The second row in input is [0,4,0], and output is [0,4,6]. The 6 comes from the first row's third element. Maybe there's a propagation from top to bottom or something.\n\nAnother approach: Looking at the output matrices, each row after the first seems to take elements from the row above. For instance, in Example 0's output:\n\nRow 1: [0,0,6]\nRow 2: [0,4,6] \u2014 here, the third element is 6, same as row1's third. The second element is 4 from input. Then row3: [3,4,6], where 4 comes from row2's second element, and 6 again. So maybe each row after the first takes the maximum of the current value or the value from the row above in the same column?\n\nWait, let's test that. For Example 0:\n\nRow2, column3: input is 0. Output is 6. Which is the max between 0 (current) and 6 (from row1's column3). So yes, 6. Then row3, column2: input is 0. Max between 0 and row2's column2 (4) is 4. Column3: input is 0, max with row2's 6 is 6. So that works.\n\nSimilarly, in Example 1:\n\nInput:\n[0,2,0]\n[7,0,8]\n[0,0,0]\n\nOutput:\n[0,2,0]\n[7,2,8]\n[7,2,8]\n\nRow2: original [7,0,8]. For column2, 0 becomes 2 (from row1's column2). So max(0, 2) is 2. Column1: 7 remains, column3:8 remains. Then row3: input is all zeros. So for each column, take max of current (0) and the value from row2. So column1 becomes 7, column2 2, column3 8. So yes, that seems to fit.\n\nAnother example: Example2.\n\nInput:\n[4,0,0]\n[0,2,0]\n[0,0,0]\n\nOutput:\n[4,0,0]\n[4,2,0]\n[4,2,0]\n\nRow2: [0,2,0] becomes [4,2,0]. So column1 in row2 is max(0 and row1's 4) \u21924. Column3 remains 0. Then row3 takes max between 0 and row2's values: 4,2,0. So output row3 is [4,2,0].\n\nSo the pattern seems to be: starting from the first row, each subsequent row in each column takes the maximum between the existing value and the value from the same column in the previous row. So for each cell (i,j), output[i][j] = max(input[i][j], output[i-1][j]). This way, each row propagates down the maximum values from above, replacing zeros or lower numbers with the maximum from above.\n\nLet me test this on the Test Input:\n\nTest Input:\n[4,0,8]\n[0,0,0]\n[0,7,0]\n\nFirst row remains as is: [4,0,8].\n\nSecond row: for each column, max between current value (0,0,0) and the value from the first row in same column.\n\nSo column1: max(0,4) \u21924.\n\nColumn2: max(0,0) \u21920.\n\nColumn3: max(0,8) \u21928.\n\nSo second row becomes [4,0,8].\n\nThird row: current values are 0,7,0. Compare with the second row's [4,0,8].\n\nColumn1: max(0,4) \u21924.\n\nColumn2: max(7,0) \u21927.\n\nColumn3: max(0,8) \u21928.\n\nSo third row becomes [4,7,8].\n\nTherefore, the output matrix should be:\n\n[4, 0, 8]\n\n[4, 0, 8]\n\n[4,7,8]\n\nWait, but let's check if there's another possible pattern. For instance, maybe each row after the first takes the maximum of the current cell and the cell above it. That would fit the examples. Let me confirm.\n\nTest Input processing:\n\nFirst row: [4,0,8] \u2192 same.\n\nSecond row:\n\nFirst column: max(0 (current) and 4 (above)) \u21924.\n\nSecond column: max(0 and 0) \u21920.\n\nThird: max(0 and 8) \u21928. So row2 is [4,0,8].\n\nThird row:\n\nFirst column: max(0 (current) and 4 (above)) \u21924.\n\nSecond column: max(7 and 0 (from row2's column2)) \u21927.\n\nThird column: max(0 and 8) \u21928. So row3: [4,7,8].\n\nSo the output would be:\n\n[4,0,8]\n\n[4,0,8]\n\n[4,7,8]\n\nWhich matches the pattern. Let's check if this aligns with the training examples.\n\nYes. For example, in Example 1's output, the second row's second column is 2 (from input row1) which becomes the max of 0 (row2 input) and 2 (row1 output). Then row3's columns take the max of their input (0) and the row2's output (7,2,8), leading to [7,2,8].\n\nSo the pattern is indeed that each cell (after the first row) is the maximum of its own value in the input and the cell above it in the output matrix.\n\nSo applying this to the test input:\n\nFirst row remains as [4,0,8].\n\nSecond row: each cell is max(input second row [0,0,0] and first row's corresponding cell). So [4,0,8].\n\nThird row: each cell is max(input third row [0,7,0] and second row's [4,0,8]). So column1: max(0,4)=4, column2: max(7,0)=7, column3: max(0,8)=8. So third row becomes [4,7,8].\n\nSo the output should be:\n\n[4, 0, 8]\n\n[4, 0, 8]\n\n[4, 7, 8]\n\nYes, that's the expected output.",

        "cot_2": "Okay, let's see. I need to figure out the pattern from the training examples to apply it to the test input. Let me look at the examples one by one.\n\nStarting with Example 0:\n\nInput:\n[0, 0, 6]\n[0, 4, 0]\n[3, 0, 0]\n\nOutput:\n[0, 0, 6]\n[0, 4, 6]\n[3, 4, 6]\n\nHmm. Looking at the columns here. The third column in input is 6,0,0. In the output, the third column becomes 6,6,6. Wait, the first row's third element is 6, then the second row's third is 6, and third row's third is 6. So maybe there's something propagating values down the columns? Let me check the other columns.\n\nFirst column in input is 0,0,3. Output first column is 0,0,3. So that doesn't change. Second column input is 0,4,0. Output is 0,4,4. So the 4 from the second row is copied down to the third row. Third column starts with 6, then becomes 6 in the second and third rows. So perhaps each column is filled from the top down, taking the maximum value encountered so far and propagating it downward. Wait, in example 0's third column, the first element is 6, then the next row's third element becomes 6 (same as above), and the third row's third element becomes 6. So maybe it's a cumulative maximum per column? Let's check example 1.\n\nExample 1 Input:\n[0, 2, 0]\n[7, 0, 8]\n[0, 0, 0]\n\nOutput:\n[0, 2, 0]\n[7, 2, 8]\n[7, 2, 8]\n\nLooking at the columns. First column input is 0,7,0. Output is 0,7,7. So first row 0, then 7 (max of 0 and 7), then 7 again. Second column: 2,0,0 \u2192 becomes 2,2,2. Third column 0,8,0 \u2192 becomes 0,8,8. So yes, it looks like each column is being transformed by taking the maximum value from the top up to that row and replacing each element with that maximum. So for each column, starting from the top, whenever there's a non-zero number, that becomes the new maximum, and all elements below are set to that maximum. Wait, but in example 0, the third column starts with 6, then the next row is 0 (input) which becomes 6, and the third row is 0 (input) which becomes 6. So it's like, in each column, once a non-zero number is encountered, all subsequent elements in that column take that value. But wait, in example 2:\n\nExample 2 Input:\n[4, 0, 0]\n[0, 2, 0]\n[0, 0, 0]\n\nOutput:\n[4, 0, 0]\n[4, 2, 0]\n[4, 2, 0]\n\nFirst column: 4,0,0 \u2192 becomes 4,4,4. Second column 0,2,0 \u2192 becomes 0,2,2. Third column remains 0,0,0. So again, for each column, once a non-zero is found, the rest below are set to that value. Wait, but in the first column of example 2, the first row is 4, so the next two rows in that column become 4. Second column's first row is 0, so it stays 0. Then in the second row of the second column, it's 2, so the third row becomes 2. So the pattern is: for each column, starting from the top, once a non-zero value is encountered, all the elements below (including that row) are set to that value. But if there's a non-zero below, does it take the first non-zero? Let's check example 1 again. First column in example 1 is 0,7,0. Output is 0,7,7. So the first non-zero in the column is 7 (second row), so starting from there, everything below becomes 7. But the first row remains 0. Wait, that's conflicting with previous examples. Wait, no. Wait, in example 0's first column: 0,0,3. The output is 0,0,3. So that's not following the pattern I thought. Because according to the earlier idea, once a non-zero is found, the rest would be set to that. But here, the third row in first column is 3. So the output first column is 0,0,3. That's not propagating the 3 upwards, but maybe the rule is different.\n\nWait, maybe the pattern is that each cell in the output is the maximum value encountered so far in that column from the top down, including the current cell. So for each column, you track the maximum as you go down each row. For example, in example 0's third column:\n\nOriginal input is 6,0,0. The max so far after first row is 6. So second row would take the max between 0 and 6 \u2192 6. Third row's value is 0, but the max so far is still 6. So output third column is 6,6,6. Similarly, first column in example 0: 0,0,3. The max so far for each row: first row is 0, second row 0, third row 3. So output first column is 0,0,3. Which matches the output.\n\nExample 1's first column: input 0,7,0. Max so far for each row would be 0 \u2192 7 \u2192 7. So output is 0,7,7. Second column input is 2,0,0 \u2192 max so far is 2, 2, 2. Third column input 0,8,0 \u2192 max so far is 0,8,8. So that's matching the outputs.\n\nExample 2: first column input 4,0,0. Max so far per row: 4,4,4. Outputs 4,4,4. Second column input 0,2,0 \u2192 max so far: 0,2,2. Third column remains 0,0,0. So yes, this seems to fit.\n\nSo the pattern is: for each column, starting from the top, each element is replaced by the maximum value encountered in that column up to and including the current row. So it's a cumulative column-wise maximum.\n\nNow let's apply this to the test input.\n\nTest Input:\n[4, 0, 8]\n[0, 0, 0]\n[0, 7, 0]\n\nProcessing each column:\n\nFirst column: 4,0,0.\n\nRow 1: max is 4 \u2192 stays 4.\n\nRow 2: max between 4 and 0 is 4 \u2192 set to 4.\n\nRow 3: max between 4 and 0 is 4 \u2192 set to 4.\n\nSo first column becomes [4,4,4].\n\nSecond column: 0,0,7.\n\nRow 1: 0.\n\nRow 2: max(0,0) \u2192 0.\n\nRow 3: max(0,7) \u21927. But wait, the current row's value is 7. So the max so far after third row is 7. So the third row would be 7. So the second column becomes [0,0,7] \u2192 but wait, that's not the case. Wait, the cumulative max for each row in the column would be:\n\nRow 1: 0 (original is 0) \u2192 remains 0.\n\nRow 2: max(0 (row1) and 0 (row2)) \u2192 0.\n\nRow 3: max(0,0,7) \u21927.\n\nSo the second column would be [0,0,7].\n\nWait, but in the test input's second column, the third row is 7. So according to the pattern, the third row would be 7, but the first two rows would remain as 0 and 0. But looking at the training examples, like in example 1's second column, the output was [2,2,2] even though the third row was 0. Because the max up to the third row would be 2. Wait, that's inconsistent. Wait no, example 1's second column input is [2,0,0]. The max up to each row:\n\nRow1: 2 \u2192 remains 2.\n\nRow2: max(2,0) \u21922.\n\nRow3: max(2,0) \u21922.\n\nSo output is [2,2,2].\n\nAh, right. Because the maximum is computed as the maximum from the top down, including previous rows. So in the test input's second column:\n\nOriginal is [0 (row1), 0 (row2),7 (row3)].\n\nProcessing each row:\n\nRow1: current value 0 \u2192 max so far 0.\n\nRow2: max between 0 (row1) and 0 (row2) \u21920.\n\nRow3: max between previous max (0) and current value 7 \u21927.\n\nSo the second column becomes [0,0,7].\n\nBut wait, in the training examples, when a higher value is found lower in the column, the rows above are not changed. Only the rows below are updated. Wait, but according to the previous reasoning, the output is that each row's element is the maximum up to and including that row. So each row is independent. Let me confirm with example 0's first column. Original first column: 0,0,3. Output is 0,0,3. So for the third row, the max up to that row is 3. The first two rows are 0 and 0, so they remain as the max up to their respective rows. So each row's output is the max of the column up to that row. So rows above aren't affected by lower rows. Wait, but that's conflicting with example 1's output.\n\nIn example 1's first column input is 0,7,0. The output is [0,7,7]. So the max after row 1 is 0. Row2 is 7, so max is 7. Row3 is 0, but the max up to row3 is max(0,7,0) =7. So output rows are 0,7,7. So the first row's value isn't changed. So the pattern is that each element is the maximum of all the elements from the top of the column down to that row. So for row i in the column, it's the max of rows 0 to i (assuming 0-based index).\n\nSo for the test input's second column:\n\nRow1: 0 \u2192 max from row0 (itself) \u21920.\n\nRow2: max of row0 and row1 \u21920 and 0 \u21920.\n\nRow3: max of row0, row1, row2 \u21920,0,7 \u21927.\n\nSo the second column in output is [0, 0,7].\n\nThird column: input is 8,0,0.\n\nRow1:8 \u2192 remains 8.\n\nRow2: max(8,0) \u21928.\n\nRow3: max(8,0,0) \u21928.\n\nSo third column becomes [8,8,8].\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\nFirst column becomes [4,4,4].\n\nSecond column [0,0,7].\n\nThird column [8,8,8].\n\nSo the output matrix is:\n\n[4, 0, 8]\n\n[4, 0, 8]\n\n[4,7,8]\n\nWait, no. Wait, columns are processed individually. Let's process each column step by step.\n\nTest input:\n\nRow1: [4,0,8]\n\nRow2: [0,0,0]\n\nRow3: [0,7,0]\n\nColumns:\n\nColumn1: 4,0,0 \u2192 process as:\n\nRow1: max is 4 \u2192 remains 4.\n\nRow2: max of 4 and 0 \u21924.\n\nRow3: max of 4 and 0 \u21924.\n\nSo column1 output is [4,4,4].\n\nColumn2: 0,0,7.\n\nRow1: 0 \u2192 remains 0.\n\nRow2: max(0,0) \u21920.\n\nRow3: max(0,0,7) \u21927.\n\nSo column2 output is [0,0,7].\n\nColumn3:8,0,0.\n\nRow1:8 \u2192 remains 8.\n\nRow2: max(8,0) \u21928.\n\nRow3: max(8,0,0) \u21928.\n\nSo column3 output is [8,8,8].\n\nNow, reconstruct the rows from the columns:\n\nRow1: column1=4, column2=0, column3=8 \u2192 [4,0,8].\n\nRow2: column1=4, column2=0, column3=8 \u2192 [4,0,8].\n\nRow3: column1=4, column2=7, column3=8 \u2192 [4,7,8].\n\nWait, but in the test input's row3, the second element is 7. So according to the processing, the third row of column2 becomes 7, but the row2 of column2 remains 0. So the output matrix is:\n\n[4,0,8]\n\n[4,0,8]\n\n[4,7,8]\n\nBut let's check against the training examples. For example, in example1:\n\nInput:\n\n[0,2,0]\n\n[7,0,8]\n\n[0,0,0]\n\nProcessing column1 (0,7,0):\n\nRow1:0 \u2192 remains 0.\n\nRow2: max(0,7)=7.\n\nRow3: max(0,7,0)=7.\n\nSo column1 becomes [0,7,7].\n\nBut the output for example1's first column is [0,7,7], which matches.\n\nSo in the test case, the output rows would be:\n\nRow1: [4,0,8]\n\nRow2: [4,0,8]\n\nRow3: [4,7,8]\n\nBut let me check the other training examples again to see if there's any case where the higher value is in a lower row. Like example2's second column:\n\nInput [0,2,0], output becomes [0,2,2]. The third row's value is 0, but the max up to that row is 2. So the third row is 2. Similarly, in the test case's second column, third row becomes 7, even though the first two rows are 0. So the output for the second column is [0,0,7].\n\nSo the test output would be:\n\nRow1: [4,0,8]\n\nRow2: [4,0,8]\n\nRow3: [4,7,8]\n\nBut looking at the training examples, like example0's third column had 6, then 0,0 in input, but output was 6,6,6. So the entire column after the first non-zero is filled with that value. Wait, but according to the cumulative max approach, the first row's 6 sets the max for that column. Then the second row's 0 is replaced with 6, and the third row's 0 with 6. Which is correct.\n\nBut in the test case's second column, the third row has 7. So according to the cumulative max approach, up to row3, the max is 7, so row3's value is 7. But rows1 and 2 remain 0 because their max up to their rows were 0. So the output for column2 is [0,0,7], not [0,7,7]. But in the training example1, the second column was [2,0,0], and the output was [2,2,2]. Which suggests that once a non-zero is found in a column, all subsequent rows (including that one) take that value. Wait, but in that case, the approach would be that once a non-zero is encountered, all the rows below (including itself) are set to that value, even if higher values are present later. But in example1, the third column was [0,8,0], output [0,8,8]. So the first row is 0, second row 8, third row 8. So it's not that the first non-zero is propagated, but the maximum value in the column is propagated from the point where it's encountered. Wait, no. Because in example1's third column, the first non-zero is 8 in the second row. So from the second row down, it's set to 8. The first row remains 0.\n\nWait, but according to the cumulative maximum approach, that's exactly what would happen. For example, the third column in example1 is [0,8,0]. The max up to row1 is 0. Up to row2 is max(0,8)=8. Up to row3, max(0,8,0)=8. So the third column becomes [0,8,8].\n\nSo for the test case's second column [0,0,7], the max up to row3 is 7, so the third row becomes 7, but the first and second rows remain 0 and 0. So the output for that column is [0,0,7]. Therefore, the final output matrix would be:\n\n[4,0,8]\n\n[4,0,8]\n\n[4,7,8]\n\nBut wait, in the training examples, when there's a non-zero in a lower row, the rows above are not updated. Only the current row and below get the max. But according to the cumulative max approach, each row is updated based on the max up to that row, not the entire column. So the first row remains as the first element, second row is the max of first two, third row is max of all three.\n\nSo in the test case's column2, the third row's output is 7, but the first two rows are 0.\n\nBut looking at the training examples, example1's column1: input [0,7,0] becomes [0,7,7]. The first row remains 0, second row becomes 7 (max up to that row), third row becomes 7 (max of all three).\n\nSo that's correct. So applying that to the test case, the output should be:\n\nRow1: [4,0,8]\n\nRow2: [4,0,8]\n\nRow3: [4,7,8]\n\nBut let's check the test input:\n\nOriginal test input:\n\nRow1: [4,0,8]\n\nRow2: [0,0,0]\n\nRow3: [0,7,0]\n\nAfter processing columns:\n\nColumn1: [4,0,0] \u2192 after max per row: [4,4,4]\n\nColumn2: [0,0,7] \u2192 [0,0,7]\n\nColumn3: [8,0,0] \u2192 [8,8,8]\n\nSo the rows are:\n\nRow1: 4 (from column1), 0 (column2), 8 (column3) \u2192 [4,0,8]\n\nRow2:4,0,8 \u2192 [4,0,8]\n\nRow3:4,7,8 \u2192 [4,7,8]\n\nSo that's the output. But let's compare with the training examples. For example, example2:\n\nInput:\n\n[4,0,0]\n\n[0,2,0]\n\n[0,0,0]\n\nOutput:\n\n[4,0,0]\n\n[4,2,0]\n\n[4,2,0]\n\nWhich is the result of column-wise cumulative max. Column1 becomes [4,4,4], column2 [0,2,2], column3 remains [0,0,0]. So rows are:\n\nRow1:4,0,0\n\nRow2:4,2,0\n\nRow3:4,2,0\n\nYes, which matches. So the test input's output should be:\n\n[4,0,8]\n\n[4,0,8]\n\n[4,7,8]\n\nBut wait, looking at the third column of the test input. The original third column is 8,0,0. The cumulative max would make it [8,8,8], so the second and third rows of the third column become 8. So row2's third element is 8, not 0.\n\nSo the output matrix is:\n\nRow1: [4,0,8]\n\nRow2: [4,0,8]\n\nRow3: [4,7,8]\n\nThat's the correct output based on the pattern."
