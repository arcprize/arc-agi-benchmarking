        "cot_1": "Okay, let's see. I need to figure out the pattern that transforms the input matrices into the output matrices in the training examples. Then apply that pattern to the test input. Let's look at the examples one by one.\n\nStarting with Example 0. The input is a 3x3 matrix:\n\n[3, 8, 7]\n[9, 3, 8]\n[7, 9, 3]\n\nThe output is a 9x9 matrix. Let me see how the original numbers are placed. The first three rows of the output start with the original first row, followed by zeros. Then the next three rows have the original second row shifted to the middle third, and the last three rows have the third row shifted to the end. Wait, no. Let me look again.\n\nOutput rows:\n\nRow 0: [3,8,7,0,0,0,0,0,0] \u2013 so the first three elements are the original row, then zeros.\nRow 1: [9,3,8,0,0,0,0,0,0] \u2013 same here.\nRow 2: [7,9,3,0,0,0,0,0,0].\nThen the next three rows have [0,0,0,3,8,7,0,0,0] \u2013 so the original first row is in positions 3-5 here. And the third set of three rows have the original first row in positions 6-8. Wait, no. Wait, the fourth row is [0,0,0,3,8,7,0,0,0] \u2013 which is the first row of the input placed starting at index 3. Then the fifth row is [9,3,8] in the middle, and the sixth row is [7,9,3] in the middle. Then the last three rows have the original rows starting at position 6. So the output seems to be arranging the original 3x3 matrix into a larger 9x9 matrix by placing copies of the original matrix in three different blocks: top-left, middle-middle, and bottom-right. But wait, the original matrix is 3x3, and the output is 9x9, which is 3 times larger in each dimension. So perhaps the output is a 3x3 grid of 3x3 blocks. Each block is either the original matrix or zeros. For example, the first three rows of the output have the original matrix in the first block (top-left), zeros elsewhere. Then the next three rows have the original matrix in the middle block (columns 3-5), and zeros elsewhere. Then the last three rows have the original matrix in the bottom-right block. So the output is three diagonal blocks of the original matrix, each shifted to the right and down by 3 positions each time. So the first block is at (0,0), the second at (3,3), the third at (6,6). Each block is the original 3x3 matrix, and the rest are zeros. That explains Example 0's output.\n\nNow Example 1:\n\nInput:\n[8,6,8]\n[3,3,8]\n[8,8,8]\n\nOutput is a 9x9 matrix. Let's look at the first three rows. The first row is [8,6,8,0,0,0,8,6,8]. So the original row is in the first three elements, then zeros, then the original row again at the end. Similarly, the second row has the original row in the first three, then zeros, then the original again. The third row the same. Then the next three rows are all zeros except the last three elements have the original rows. Wait no: the fourth row is [0,0,0,0,0,0,8,6,8]. Then fifth is same with [3,3,8], sixth [8,8,8]. Then the last three rows have the original rows repeated twice: like [8,6,8,8,6,8,8,6,8]. So each row in the output is the original row repeated three times, but with zeros in between? Or perhaps the blocks are arranged differently.\n\nWait, in Example 1's output, the first three rows have their original row in the first block and third block. The middle three rows (rows 3-5) have the original rows in the third block. Then the last three rows (6-8) have the original rows in all three blocks? Let me check:\n\nRow 6: [8,6,8,8,6,8,8,6,8] \u2013 so the first third is original, middle third is original, last third is original. So the entire row is the original row repeated three times. Similarly, row 7: [3,3,8,3,3,8,3,3,8]. Row 8: [8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8].\n\nHmm, this is different from Example 0. So the pattern isn't the same. So perhaps the arrangement of the original matrix into the output depends on some pattern in the input matrix.\n\nLooking at Example 2's input and output. Input is:\n\n[6,9,9]\n[4,6,8]\n[9,9,8]\n\nThe output's first three rows have [0,0,0,6,9,9,6,9,9]. So the fourth to sixth elements are the original row, and the seventh to ninth elements are the original row again. The next three rows (3-5) are all zeros. The last three rows (6-8) have the original row in the first and second blocks. So first block (positions 0-2) is the original row, then the next three positions (3-5) are the original row again, then zeros for the last three. Wait, row 6: [6,9,9,6,9,9,0,0,0]. Yes. So the original row is repeated in the first and second blocks, then zeros. So each example's output seems to arrange the original rows into different blocks of the 9x9 matrix. \n\nWhat's the pattern here? Maybe the way the original rows are placed in the output depends on the numbers in the input matrix. Let's see if there's a connection between the input values and where they are placed in the output.\n\nLooking at Example 0: the output has three diagonal blocks. Each block is the original matrix. The other blocks are zeros. Example 1's output has more repetition. The first three rows have the original in the first and third blocks. The next three rows have the original in the third block. The last three rows have the original in all three blocks. Example 2's output first three rows have original in the second and third blocks, the next three rows are zeros, and the last three have original in the first and second blocks. \n\nWait, perhaps the arrangement depends on the sum or some other property of the rows or elements. Alternatively, maybe the positions where the original rows are placed in the output are determined by certain elements in the input matrix.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each element in the input matrix determines where the original row is placed. For instance, in Example 0, the input has numbers 3,8,7,9, etc. Maybe each row is placed in blocks corresponding to the value of the first element. Let's check:\n\nIn Example 0's input:\n\nFirst row starts with 3. The output has the first row in the first, fourth, and seventh positions. Wait, but the output has three blocks. Each block is 3x3. So the first block is rows 0-2, columns 0-2; second block is rows 3-5, columns 3-5; third block rows 6-8, columns 6-8.\n\nIn Example 0's output, the first three rows are the original rows in the first block (columns 0-2). Then rows 3-5 have the original rows in the second block (columns 3-5). Rows 6-8 have original rows in the third block (columns 6-8). So each block is placed diagonally.\n\nBut why? What's the connection to the input? Let's see the input for Example 0. Each row starts with 3,9,7. Not sure if that's relevant.\n\nLooking at Example 1's input: first row starts with 8. Output first three rows have the original row in blocks 0 and 2 (columns 0-2 and 6-8). Then rows 3-5 have the original in block 2. Rows 6-8 have the original in all three blocks. So perhaps the position of the block is determined by the elements in the row. For example, if the first element is even, then place the row in certain blocks. Or maybe the sum of the row. Let's calculate some sums:\n\nExample 0 input rows:\n\nRow 0: 3+8+7=18\n\nRow 1:9+3+8=20\n\nRow 2:7+9+3=19\n\nNot sure.\n\nExample 1 input rows:\n\nRow 0:8+6+8=22\n\nRow1:3+3+8=14\n\nRow2:8+8+8=24\n\nExample 2 input rows:\n\nRow0:6+9+9=24\n\nRow1:4+6+8=18\n\nRow2:9+9+8=26\n\nNot obvious.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the first element of each row in Example 0's input: 3,9,7. The output arranges each row into diagonal blocks. For Example 1's input rows start with 8,3,8. The output's first three rows have the original rows in blocks 0 and 2. The next three have original rows in block 2, and the last three in all blocks. Example 2's input rows start with 6,4,9. The output first three rows have the original in blocks 1 and 2, the next three rows are zero, and the last three have original in blocks 0 and 1. So maybe the first element of each row determines which blocks the row is placed into. For instance:\n\nIn Example 0, first element of each row is 3,9,7. Perhaps modulo 3? 3 mod 3 is 0, 9 mod 3 is 0, 7 mod 3 is 1. So perhaps the block index is determined by (first element mod 3). Then 3 mod3=0, so placed in block 0 (first block), 9 mod3=0, same, 7 mod3=1, block 1. But in Example0's output, all rows are placed in blocks 0,1,2 (the diagonal). Wait, no. The output in Example0 is three blocks: each row of the original is placed in all three blocks diagonally. Hmm, maybe that's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is a Kronecker product or some kind of tiling. For instance, in Example0, the output is the original matrix placed three times along the diagonal of a 3x3 grid of 3x3 matrices. But why in Example1 the arrangement is different.\n\nWait, let me think of the output as a 3x3 grid of 3x3 blocks. So each block is 3x3. The entire output is 9x9. So each block can be at position (i,j) where i and j are 0,1,2 (for the grid). For example, the first block is (0,0), then (0,1), (0,2), etc.\n\nIn Example0's output, each original row is placed in the blocks (0,0), (1,1), (2,2) \u2013 forming a diagonal. So each row of the input matrix is placed into the diagonal blocks of the output matrix. For example, the first input row [3,8,7] is in the (0,0) block's first row, (1,1) block's first row, and (2,2) block's first row? Wait, no. Let me look again. The output in Example0 has:\n\nFirst three rows (0-2) have the original rows in columns 0-2 (block 0,0), then the next three rows (3-5) have original rows shifted to columns 3-5 (block 1,1), and the last three rows (6-8) have them in columns 6-8 (block 2,2). So each row of the original is placed into a diagonal block's corresponding row. So row 0 of input is in block (0,0) row 0, block (1,1) row 0, and block (2,2) row 0. Wait, no. Let me check:\n\nLooking at Example0's output:\n\nRow 0: [3,8,7,0,0,0,0,0,0] \u2192 block (0,0) row 0: [3,8,7], block (0,1) row 0: zeros, etc.\n\nThen row 3 is [0,0,0,3,8,7,0,0,0] \u2192 block (1,0) is zeros, block (1,1) is [3,8,7], etc.\n\nRow 6 is [0,0,0,0,0,0,3,8,7] \u2192 block (2,2) is [3,8,7].\n\nWait, but each original row is appearing in the diagonal blocks. So the first row of the input is placed in the (0,0) block's first row, (1,1) block's first row, and (2,2) block's first row. But that's not possible because the output has 9 rows, each block's rows would correspond to the output rows. So, for example, the first three rows of the output correspond to the first row of each block in the first row of the grid. Wait, maybe the output is structured such that the original matrix is placed along the diagonal of the 3x3 grid of blocks. So the (0,0) block is the original matrix, (1,1) block is original, (2,2) block is original. The other blocks are zero. So the output is a diagonal matrix of the original matrix. But in Example0's output, each row of the original appears three times in the output. For example, the first input row [3,8,7] appears as the first row, fourth row, seventh row of the output. Wait no, the first three output rows are the original three rows in the first block. Then rows 3-5 are the original rows in the second block. Rows 6-8 are the original rows in the third block. So each original row appears once in each diagonal block. So the entire original matrix is placed in each diagonal block. So the output is a 9x9 matrix where each 3x3 diagonal block is the original matrix. That would explain Example0.\n\nBut then why is Example1 different? Let's look. The input in Example1's output has the first three rows as the original rows in blocks 0,0 and 0,2 (since the first row is [8,6,8,0,0,0,8,6,8] \u2192 so columns 0-2 and 6-8). Then rows 3-5 have the original rows in block 2,2. Rows 6-8 have the original rows in all three blocks. So the placement is not diagonal here. So there's a different pattern here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output depends on the presence of certain numbers in the input matrix. For example, in Example1's input, the first row starts with 8. The output's first row has the original row in block 0 and 2. Maybe 8 modulo 3 is 2 (since 8 mod3 is 2), so blocks 0 and 2. Similarly, the second row starts with 3, which mod3 is 0. So block 0? But in the output, the second row is in blocks 0 and 2 as well. Hmm, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the number of times a row is duplicated depends on some property. For example, in Example0, each row is duplicated three times (once per diagonal block). In Example1, the first three rows have two copies (blocks 0 and 2), then one copy, then three copies. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is a combination of the original matrix being placed in certain positions based on the row and column indices. For example, each row in the input is copied into the output in positions shifted by some multiple of the original row or column. But how?\n\nAnother approach: Let's think of the output as a 3x3 grid of 3x3 blocks. The total output is 9x9. For each example, the original 3x3 matrix is placed in certain blocks of this grid.\n\nIn Example0, the original is placed in the (0,0), (1,1), (2,2) blocks (diagonal). So each diagonal block is the input matrix.\n\nIn Example1, the original matrix is placed in blocks (0,0), (0,2), (2,0), (2,2), etc. For example, the first three output rows have the original in blocks 0 and 2. Then rows 3-5 have zeros except block 2. Rows 6-8 have the original in all three blocks. So maybe the placement is based on certain conditions.\n\nLooking at the input matrices, perhaps the presence of certain numbers in specific positions determines where the matrix is placed. For example, if the element in position (i,j) is even, then place the row in a certain block.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each element in the input matrix is part of a binary flag that determines which blocks to activate. For instance, each element could correspond to a block in the output grid, but that might be complicated.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the sum of each row in the input and seeing if there's a pattern. Let's compute the sums for each example:\n\nExample0:\n\nRow sums: 3+8+7=18; 9+3+8=20; 7+9+3=19.\n\nExample1:\n\nRow sums:8+6+8=22; 3+3+8=14;8+8+8=24.\n\nExample2:\n\nRow sums:6+9+9=24;4+6+8=18;9+9+8=26.\n\nNot sure. Alternatively, looking at the parity (even or odd) of elements.\n\nExample0's input has 3 (odd),8 (even),7 (odd) in the first row. Maybe even numbers determine where to place.\n\nBut this doesn't immediately explain the output structure.\n\nLet's think differently. Let's count the number of non-zero blocks in each example's output.\n\nExample0's output has 3 blocks (diagonal) each with the original matrix, so 3 blocks of non-zero.\n\nExample1's output has more blocks. The first three rows have two blocks (0,0 and 0,2) with original rows. Then rows 3-5 have one block (2,2). Rows 6-8 have three blocks (0,0, 0,2, 2,0, 2,2? Or all three). For example, row 6: [8,6,8,8,6,8,8,6,8] \u2192 which is the original row repeated in each of the three blocks (0,0: first three, 1,1: next three, 2,2: last three? No, because the blocks are 3x3. So each third of the row corresponds to a block in the same grid row. Wait, the output is 9 rows, each row is divided into three parts of 3 elements each. Each part corresponds to a block in the same row of the 3x3 grid. For example, the first three elements of a row belong to the first block in grid row 0, columns 0-2. The next three belong to grid row 0, columns 3-5 (block (0,1)), and the last three to grid row 0, columns 6-8 (block (0,2)). Wait, no. Because each grid row in the 3x3 grid of blocks has three blocks. Each output row is part of one grid row, but spans all three blocks horizontally. For example, output row 0 is part of grid row 0. It contains three blocks horizontally: block (0,0), block (0,1), block (0,2). Each block is 3 elements wide. So in Example0's row 0, the first three elements (block 0,0) are the original row, the next three (block 0,1) are zeros, and the last three (block 0,2) are zeros. Then in row 3, which is part of grid row 1, the first block (1,0) is zeros, second block (1,1) is original row, third block (1,2) zeros. In row 6 (grid row 2), the first two blocks are zeros, third block (2,2) is original.\n\nSo in Example0, the output has the original matrix in each diagonal block (i,i) of the 3x3 grid. All other blocks are zeros.\n\nIn Example1's output:\n\nRow 0 has block (0,0) as [8,6,8], block (0,1) zeros, block (0,2) as [8,6,8].\n\nRow 3 (grid row 1) has all blocks zeros except block (1,2) which has [8,6,8].\n\nRow 6 (grid row 2) has block (2,0) as [8,6,8], block (2,1) as [8,6,8], block (2,2) as [8,6,8].\n\nSo the blocks where the original is placed are (0,0), (0,2), (1,2), (2,0), (2,1), (2,2). Hmm, not sure.\n\nBut why these blocks? Looking at the input of Example1:\n\n[8,6,8]\n[3,3,8]\n[8,8,8]\n\nPerhaps the original matrix is placed in blocks where the corresponding element in the input is even. For example, let's take each element of the input matrix and determine if it's even. Then, for each element that is even, the corresponding block in the output grid is filled with the original matrix.\n\nBut how does that mapping work? Let's see:\n\nInput matrix for Example1:\n\nRow 0: 8 (even),6 (even),8 (even)\nRow 1:3 (odd),3 (odd),8 (even)\nRow 2:8 (even),8 (even),8 (even)\n\nIf each even element in the input corresponds to a block in the output where the original is placed. For example, the input has (0,0) as 8 (even), so block (0,0) in the output is original. Similarly, (0,1) is 6 (even), so block (0,1) has original. (0,2) is 8, even \u2192 block (0,2) has original. But in Example1's output, the first row has original in (0,0) and (0,2) but not (0,1). Hmm, not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each even element in the input causes the entire original matrix to be placed in a certain block. But this seems complicated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the sum of the digits in the row determines the number of times the row is repeated. For Example1's first row sum is 22, which has two even digits. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, looking for symmetry. In Example1's input, the first and third rows are all even numbers except the third row has all 8s. The output has the first row repeated in multiple blocks. Maybe if the row has all even numbers, it's repeated more times. For example, the third row of Example1's input is all 8s (even), and in the output's last three rows, each row is the original row repeated three times. Whereas the first row has even numbers and is repeated twice in the first three rows.\n\nBut how to connect this?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the number of even elements in the row determines how many blocks the row is placed in. For example, in Example1:\n\nRow0 has all even elements (8,6,8) \u2192 3 even elements. So the row is placed in three blocks. But in the output, the first three rows of Example1 have the row in two blocks (0,0 and 0,2). Wait, no. Row0 of the output is [8,6,8,0,0,0,8,6,8], so placed in blocks (0,0) and (0,2). But why two blocks? Because the number of even elements is three, but the output has two blocks for this row. Not sure.\n\nExample2's input has first row [6,9,9]. 6 is even, 9s are odd. So one even element. The output's first three rows have the row in blocks (0,1) and (0,2). So two blocks. Maybe the number of even elements in the row plus one? 1 even element \u2192 two blocks. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the position of the even elements in the row determines which blocks to place the row. For instance, in Example1's first row, all are even. So perhaps each even element corresponds to a block. But how?\n\nAlternatively, the number of even elements in each row determines the number of repetitions. For example, if a row has 3 even elements, it's repeated three times in the output. For Example0, the first row has 3,8,7 \u2192 two even elements (8). So maybe two repetitions, but in Example0's output, each row is in three blocks. Hmm, this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, the sum of the row modulo 3 determines the block. For example, Example0's first row sum is 18 \u2192 18 mod3=0. So block 0. But in the output, the row is in block 0,1,2. So not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the pattern is that each row in the input is shifted and placed in the output based on the row index. For example, row i is placed starting at column 3*i. But in Example0, each row is placed at 0, 3, 6. So row 0 at 0, row 1 at 3, row 2 at 6. But that's not exactly the case. Example0's output has all three rows placed at 0, then 3, then 6 in different sections.\n\nThis approach isn't yielding results. Let's think of another angle. \n\nIn Example0, the output is the original matrix placed along the diagonal. In Example1, the output seems to have the original matrix placed in certain positions, perhaps based on the input's elements. \n\nAnother observation: the output matrices in all examples are 9x9. The input is 3x3. The output is formed by arranging copies of the input's rows into the output rows in specific positions. For example, in Example0, each row of the input is placed in three different positions (first three, middle three, last three) of the output rows. Each input row is spread across three output rows. Wait, for Example0's output:\n\nRow 0: [3,8,7,0,0,0,0,0,0] \u2192 input row 0 in first block.\n\nRow 3: [0,0,0,3,8,7,0,0,0] \u2192 input row 0 in second block.\n\nRow 6: [0,0,0,0,0,0,3,8,7] \u2192 input row 0 in third block.\n\nBut this is not correct. Because row 3 of the output has input row 0's elements in the middle block, but according to the input, row 3 of the output is actually input row 1 (the input row 1 is [9,3,8]). Wait, no, looking back at Example0's output:\n\nOutput rows:\n\n0: [3,8,7,0,0,0,0,0,0] \u2192 input row 0.\n\n1: [9,3,8,0,0,0,0,0,0] \u2192 input row 1.\n\n2: [7,9,3,0,0,0,0,0,0] \u2192 input row 2.\n\n3: [0,0,0,3,8,7,0,0,0] \u2192 input row 0 again.\n\n4: [0,0,0,9,3,8,0,0,0] \u2192 input row 1 again.\n\n5: [0,0,0,7,9,3,0,0,0] \u2192 input row 2 again.\n\n6: [0,0,0,0,0,0,3,8,7] \u2192 input row 0 again.\n\n7: [0,0,0,0,0,0,9,3,8] \u2192 input row 1 again.\n\n8: [0,0,0,0,0,0,7,9,3] \u2192 input row 2 again.\n\nSo each input row is repeated three times in the output: once in each block (first, middle, last) of their respective output rows. So for output row 0, it's input row 0 in the first block. Output row 3 is input row 0 in the middle block. Output row 6 is input row 0 in the last block. But this can't be right because output rows 0-2 correspond to input rows 0-2 in the first block, then rows 3-5 are input rows 0-2 in the middle block, etc. So each input row appears in three different output rows, each time shifted to a different block.\n\nBut why? What's the pattern here? For example, in Example0, each input row is placed in the same position in each block. So input row 0 is in output rows 0,3,6. Input row 1 is in output rows 1,4,7. Input row 2 is in output rows 2,5,8. So each input row is placed in three output rows, each time shifted by three columns.\n\nBut what determines this pattern? In Example0, this seems to be the case. In Example1, the pattern is different. Let's check:\n\nExample1's output:\n\nRows 0-2: each input row is placed in the first and third block. For example, row 0 is [8,6,8,0,0,0,8,6,8] \u2192 input row 0 in block 0 and 2.\n\nRows 3-5: each input row is placed in the third block. So row3 is [0,0,0,0,0,0,8,6,8] \u2192 input row 0 in block 2.\n\nRows6-8: each input row is repeated in all three blocks. Row6 is [8,6,8,8,6,8,8,6,8] \u2192 input row0 in all three blocks.\n\nSo each input row appears in different combinations of blocks depending on the output row's position. \n\nThis suggests that the pattern involves each input row being placed in different blocks based on the output row's index modulo 3. For example, in Example0, output row 0,3,6 (mod3 0) have the input row in block 0, then 1, then 2. But that doesn't align.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is constructed by concatenating shifted versions of the input rows. For example, in Example0, each output row is the input row followed by zeros, then another copy of the input row shifted by 3, then another shifted by 6. But not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is a Kronecker product of the input matrix with a certain pattern matrix. For example, if the input matrix is A, the output could be A \u2297 B, where B is a matrix that determines the placement. For Example0, B could be a diagonal matrix of ones. But Example0's output has each row of the input appearing three times, which isn't a Kronecker product. \n\nAlternatively, think of the output as a 3x3 grid where each cell is a 3x3 matrix. For Example0, each diagonal cell is the input matrix, others are zero. For Example1, some cells have the input matrix, others are zero. But how to determine which cells?\n\nPerhaps the cells where the input matrix is placed correspond to the positions of the elements in the input matrix that are equal to a certain value. For example, in Example1, maybe elements equal to 8 are mapped to specific blocks.\n\nBut this seems vague.\n\nAnother approach: Let's look for relationships between the input and output matrices.\n\nIn Example0's input, all rows are permutations of the same three numbers: 3,8,7; 9,3,8;7,9,3. Not sure.\n\nIn Example1's input, the third row is all 8s. The output for the third row (rows6-8) has all three blocks filled with 8s. So maybe when a row has all elements the same, that row is repeated in all blocks in the output. Example1's third row is all 8s, and in the output, rows6-8 have the row repeated three times. That makes sense.\n\nSimilarly, Example2's input has the third row [9,9,8], not all the same. But in Example2's output, the last three rows have the original row in the first and second blocks. Hmm.\n\nAnother observation: In Example1's output, the last three rows (rows6-8) have each row repeated three times. The corresponding input row is [8,8,8], which is all 8s. So when a row is composed of the same number, it's placed in all three blocks of the output row. Similarly, in Example0, none of the rows have the same elements, so each row is placed in each block once. But in Example0's output, each row is placed in three different positions. But in Example0's output, each input row is in three different output rows, each in a different block. \n\nAlternatively, the number of times a row is repeated in the output depends on how many unique elements are in the row. For example, if a row has all elements the same, it's repeated three times. If it has two unique elements, two times. If three unique elements, three times. But in Example0, each row has three unique elements. So they are repeated three times. Example1's third row has one unique element, repeated three times. Example1's first row has two unique elements (8 and 6), so repeated two times. But in Example1's output, the first row is repeated twice in the first three output rows. Hmm.\n\nExample1's first input row is [8,6,8], which has two unique elements (8 and6). In the output's first three rows, this row is placed in two blocks (0,0 and 0,2). Then in rows3-5, once. In rows6-8, three times. So maybe not directly related.\n\nAlternatively, the repetition is based on the maximum occurrence of any number in the row. For example, if a row has a number appearing three times, then it's repeated three times in all blocks. If a number appears twice, then two times. Example1's third row has three 8s \u2192 repeated three times. First row has two 8s \u2192 repeated two times? But in the output's first three rows, the row appears twice. But in the last three rows, it's repeated three times.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Perhaps I'm missing a simpler pattern. Let's look for a pattern in how the input rows are arranged in the output.\n\nIn all examples, each output row is 9 elements long. These are divided into three sections of three elements each. Each section corresponds to a block in a 3x3 grid of blocks. Each output row belongs to a particular grid row. For example, the first three output rows are grid row 0, the next three are grid row 1, and the last three are grid row 2.\n\nWithin each grid row, the three sections (blocks) are arranged from left to right. For each output row, which is in grid row i, the sections are blocks (i,0), (i,1), (i,2). For example, output row 0 is in grid row 0, so its sections are blocks (0,0), (0,1), (0,2).\n\nIn Example0's output, for grid row 0, only block (0,0) has the original matrix. For grid row 1, block (1,1) has the original. For grid row 2, block (2,2). So diagonal.\n\nIn Example1's output, for grid row 0, blocks (0,0) and (0,2) have the original. For grid row 1, block (1,2) has the original. For grid row 2, all blocks (2,0), (2,1), (2,2) have the original.\n\nIn Example2's output, grid row 0 has blocks (0,1) and (0,2) with original. Grid row 1 has all zeros. Grid row 2 has blocks (2,0) and (2,1) with original.\n\nSo the pattern seems to be that for each grid row i, certain blocks (i,j) are filled with the original row. The selection of j depends on the input data.\n\nLooking for a pattern between the input's row and the blocks filled in the output's grid row i.\n\nFor example, in Example0:\n\nInput rows:\n\nRow 0: [3,8,7]\n\nOutput grid row 0: blocks (0,0) filled.\n\nGrid row 1: block (1,1) filled.\n\nGrid row 2: block (2,2) filled.\n\nSo each grid row i fills block (i,i) with the original row i of the input.\n\nBut Example1's input row 0 is [8,6,8]. Output grid row 0 fills blocks (0,0) and (0,2). How is this determined?\n\nLooking at the input row 0: the first element is 8, the middle is 6, the last is 8. Perhaps the positions where the elements are even determine the columns j in the grid row i. For example, in row i=0, if elements are even in positions 0 and 2, then blocks (0,0) and (0,2) are filled.\n\nBut how to connect the elements to the blocks.\n\nAlternatively, for each element in the input row, if it is even, then the corresponding block column is filled. For example, input row 0 has elements 8 (even), 6 (even), 8 (even). So for grid row 0, blocks (0,0), (0,1), (0,2) would be filled. But in Example1's output, grid row 0 has blocks (0,0) and (0,2) filled. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAnother idea: for each element in the input row, if it is even, then the block in column j is filled, where j is the position of the element. For example, input row 0 has 8 (position 0, even) \u2192 column 0 filled. 6 (position 1, even) \u2192 column 1 filled. 8 (position 2, even) \u2192 column 2 filled. So all three blocks would be filled, but in Example1's output, grid row 0 has columns 0 and 2 filled. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the number of even elements in the row determines the number of blocks filled. For Example1's row 0 has three even elements \u2192 three blocks filled. But in reality, two blocks are filled in the output.\n\nThis approach isn't working. Let's try to find another pattern.\n\nLet's look at Example2's input:\n\n[6,9,9]\n[4,6,8]\n[9,9,8]\n\nThe output's grid row 0 (rows 0-2) has blocks (0,1) and (0,2) filled. For example, row 0 of output is [0,0,0,6,9,9,6,9,9] \u2192 blocks (0,1) and (0,2) filled. Why? The input row 0 is [6,9,9]. So 6 is even, 9s are odd. Maybe the first even element's position determines the block. Here, first even is at position 0 (6), so block 0? But in the output, it's block 1 and 2.\n\nAlternatively, the sum of the even elements' positions. In row0 of Example2, even elements are 6 at position0. Sum is 0. Maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the number of even elements in the row determines the shift. For example, row0 in Example2 has one even element. So the original row is shifted by one block. So instead of starting at block 0, it starts at block 1. But then why two blocks filled?\n\nAlternatively, the placement depends on the values of the elements. For example, in Example1's row0 (8,6,8), the values are even, so they are placed in blocks 0 and 2. But 8 mod3 is 2, 6 mod3 is 0. So 8 mod3 is 2 \u2192 block 2, 6 mod3 is 0 \u2192 block 0. So the row is placed in blocks 0 and 2. Similarly, for Example2's row0, 6 mod3=0 \u2192 block0, but in the output, it's placed in blocks1 and 2. Doesn't fit.\n\nAnother thought: maybe the output is generated by a convolution of the input matrix with a kernel, but that's a stretch.\n\nAlternatively, the output is a combination of the input matrix and its rotations or reflections. For example, Example0's output is diagonal blocks of the original, Example1's output includes original and its horizontal flip. But not sure.\n\nPerhaps the key is to look at the input matrix and see how it's transformed into the output.\n\nExample0's input is:\n\n3 8 7\n\n9 3 8\n\n7 9 3\n\nThe output has three diagonal blocks of this matrix. So each diagonal block is the input matrix.\n\nExample1's input:\n\n8 6 8\n\n3 3 8\n\n8 8 8\n\nThe output has the input matrix in various blocks. For example, in grid row 0, blocks (0,0) and (0,2) are filled with the input rows. In grid row 2, all three blocks are filled. \n\nExample2's input:\n\n6 9 9\n\n4 6 8\n\n9 9 8\n\nThe output has grid row 0 filled in blocks (0,1) and (0,2), grid row 2 filled in blocks (2,0) and (2,1), and grid row1 is all zeros.\n\nThis seems arbitrary, but maybe the pattern is that for each cell (i,j) in the input matrix, if the input cell is even, then the corresponding block in the output's grid is filled with the entire input matrix. But how would that work?\n\nFor example, in Example1's input, cell (0,0) is 8 (even). So the block (0,0) is filled. Cell (0,2) is 8 (even), so block (0,2) is filled. Hence, grid row0 has blocks 0 and 2 filled. Similarly, cell (2,0) is 8 (even) \u2192 block (2,0) filled. Cell (2,1) is 8 (even) \u2192 block (2,1) filled. Cell (2,2) is 8 (even) \u2192 block (2,2) filled. So in grid row2, all three blocks are filled. For cell (1,2) is 8 (even) \u2192 block (1,2) filled. So grid row1 has block 2 filled. This matches Example1's output.\n\nYes! This seems to fit. Let's test this hypothesis:\n\nFor each cell (i,j) in the input matrix, if the value is even, then the output's grid block (i,j) is filled with the entire input matrix. \n\nLet's check Example0:\n\nInput matrix:\n\n3 (odd), 8 (even),7 (odd)\n\n9 (odd),3 (odd),8 (even)\n\n7 (odd),9 (odd),3 (odd)\n\nSo even cells are (0,1) and (1,2). So blocks (0,1) and (1,2) would be filled with the input matrix. But in Example0's output, the blocks filled are (0,0), (1,1), (2,2), which are diagonal. This doesn't match. So this hypothesis is incorrect.\n\nAlternative hypothesis: For each cell (i,j) in the input matrix, if the value is even, then the output's grid block (i,j) is filled with the input's row i. So each even element in row i, column j of the input matrix causes the output's grid block (i,j) to include the input's row i.\n\nLet's test this with Example1:\n\nInput matrix:\n\nRow0:8(even),6(even),8(even)\n\nRow1:3(odd),3(odd),8(even)\n\nRow2:8(even),8(even),8(even)\n\nSo for each even cell (i,j), the output's grid block (i,j) will have the input's row i.\n\nIn Example1's output:\n\nGrid row 0 (i=0) has blocks (0,0), (0,1), (0,2) filled. But according to the input, row0 has all even elements. So all three blocks (0,0), (0,1), (0,2) should have row0 of input. Let's look at Example1's output:\n\nRow0: [8,6,8,0,0,0,8,6,8]. So block (0,0) is row0, block (0,2) is row0. Block (0,1) is zeros. So this doesn't match. \n\nBut according to the hypothesis, since row0 has even elements in all columns, all three blocks in grid row0 should have row0. But in the output, only blocks 0 and 2 are filled. So this hypothesis is also incorrect.\n\nAlternative approach: Perhaps the output is a combination of the input matrix and its rotations. For example, each block in the output is a rotated version of the input matrix. But I don't see how that applies here.\n\nAnother angle: Each example's output has a certain number of copies of the input matrix arranged in the 3x3 grid of blocks. The number and position of these copies might be determined by some property of the input matrix.\n\nIn Example0, the input matrix has three even numbers. The output has three copies arranged diagonally. \n\nIn Example1, the input has more even numbers, and the output has more copies.\n\nBut this doesn't directly explain the positions.\n\nAnother observation: The output for each example has 9 rows, which is the same as the number of elements in the input matrix. Each row of the output corresponds to a certain cell in the input matrix. For example, output row 0 corresponds to input cell (0,0), row1 to (0,1), row2 to (0,2), row3 to (1,0), etc. But looking at Example0's output:\n\nOutput rows 0-2 correspond to input row0,1,2. Then rows3-5 are input row0,1,2 again. Then rows6-8 are input row0,1,2 again. So each input row is repeated three times. Each time, shifted to a different block.\n\nBut how does this relate to the input's data?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is a 3x3 matrix of 3x3 blocks, where each block is the input matrix multiplied by a certain factor. For instance, if the input matrix is A, then the output could be a block matrix where each block is either A or zero. The placement of A depends on certain conditions.\n\nBut how to determine the conditions?\n\nExample0's output has A in the diagonal blocks.\n\nExample1 has A in (0,0), (0,2), (1,2), (2,0), (2,1), (2,2).\n\nExample2 has A in (0,1), (0,2), (2,0), (2,1).\n\nWhat's common between these positions? For Example1, the even numbers in the input correspond to certain block positions.\n\nIn Example1's input:\n\nRow0: [8,6,8] \u2192 even, even, even \u2192 positions (0,0), (0,1), (0,2) even. So blocks (0,0), (0,1), (0,2) are filled. But in the output, grid row0 has blocks (0,0) and (0,2) filled. So not all.\n\nThis approach isn't working. Let's try to think of the problem differently.\n\nEach example's output is a 9x9 matrix made by arranging copies of the input rows in specific positions. The key is to determine for each input row, which sections of the output rows are filled with that input row.\n\nLooking at Example0:\n\nEach input row appears in three different output rows, each shifted to a different block (first, middle, last). For example, input row0 appears in output row0 (block0), output row3 (block1), output row6 (block2).\n\nThe pattern here seems to be that each input row i is placed in output rows i, i+3, i+6, in blocks 0,1,2 respectively.\n\nBut Example1's output doesn't follow this. In Example1's output, input row0 is in output row0 (block0 and block2), row3 (block2), row6 (all blocks). So the placement isn't following a simple shift.\n\nAnother idea: The output is a result of some matrix operation. For example, the Kronecker product or tensor product. Let's see:\n\nThe Kronecker product of the input matrix A with a 3x3 matrix that has 1s in certain positions and 0s elsewhere.\n\nFor Example0, if the Kronecker product is A \u2297 I, where I is the identity matrix, then you get the diagonal blocks. But that's exactly Example0's output. But Example1's output doesn't fit this pattern.\n\nSo Example0's output is A \u2297 I, where I is 3x3 identity matrix. Example1's output is something else. But how to determine the pattern.\n\nAlternatively, the output is generated by placing the input matrix in certain positions based on the value of the elements. For example, each element in the input determines the presence of the matrix in a certain block.\n\nBut this is too vague.\n\nMaybe the problem is to generate a larger matrix where each row is the input row, padded with zeros in different positions based on some rule.\n\nFor example, in Example0, each row of the input is placed in three different positions: the original position, shifted by 3 columns, and shifted by 6 columns, each in separate output rows. So each input row generates three output rows with different shifts. But Example0's output has nine rows, which are the three input rows each shifted three times. This fits with Example0's output.\n\nBut in Example1, the first three output rows are shifted 0 and 6 columns. The next three are shifted 6. The last three are shifted 0,3,6. So the shift pattern varies.\n\nBut why?\n\nAnother observation: The test input is:\n\n[1,1,7]\n\n[7,4,1]\n\n[5,1,7]\n\nThe output needs to be generated based on the pattern learned from the training examples.\n\nLet's try to find a pattern that explains all three training examples.\n\nLooking at Example0's output: the output is a 3x3 grid of blocks. The diagonal blocks are filled with the input matrix. Other blocks are zero.\n\nExample1's output: the blocks (0,0), (0,2), (1,2), (2,0), (2,1), (2,2) are filled with the input matrix. The other blocks are zero.\n\nExample2's output: blocks (0,1), (0,2), (2,0), (2,1) are filled with the input matrix. Other blocks are zero.\n\nLooking at the input matrices:\n\nExample0's input has even numbers in positions (0,1) and (1,2).\n\nExample1's input has even numbers in most positions.\n\nExample2's input has even numbers in positions (0,0), (1,0), (1,1), (1,2), (2,2).\n\nBut how to connect this to the blocks filled.\n\nAnother approach: For each block (i,j) in the output grid, determine whether it's filled based on some condition involving the input matrix's element at position (i,j) modulo some number.\n\nFor example, if element (i,j) is even, then block (i,j) is filled with the input matrix.\n\nTesting this:\n\nExample0's input:\n\n3 (odd) at (0,0) \u2192 block (0,0) not filled. But in Example0's output, block (0,0) is filled. So this doesn't work.\n\nExample1's input:\n\n(0,0) is 8 (even) \u2192 block (0,0) filled. Which matches the output.\n\n(0,1) is 6 (even) \u2192 block (0,1) should be filled. But in Example1's output, block (0,1) is zero. So this hypothesis is incorrect.\n\nAlternative hypothesis: For each block (i,j), it is filled with the input matrix if the sum of i and j in the input matrix's element at (i,j) is even.\n\nBut this requires more analysis.\n\nAlternatively, the blocks are filled if the corresponding element in the input matrix is even. But in Example1's input, (0,1) is 6 (even), but block (0,1) is not filled. So no.\n\nAnother idea: The blocks are filled based on the sum of the row and column indices of the input element. For example, if i + j is even, then fill the block. But not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the position of the block (i,j) is filled if the input matrix's element at (j,i) is even. For example, transposing the indices.\n\nTesting Example1's input element (j,i) for block (i,j):\n\nBlock (0,0): j=0,i=0 \u2192 element (0,0)=8 even \u2192 filled. Which matches.\n\nBlock (0,1): j=1,i=0 \u2192 element (0,1)=6 even \u2192 filled. But in Example1's output, block (0,1) is not filled. So this doesn't work.\n\nThis is getting frustrating. Let's think of a different strategy.\n\nLooking at the test input:\n\n[1,1,7]\n\n[7,4,1]\n\n[5,1,7]\n\nThe elements are:\n\nRow0: 1 (odd), 1 (odd),7 (odd)\n\nRow1:7 (odd),4 (even),1 (odd)\n\nRow2:5 (odd),1 (odd),7 (odd)\n\nThe only even element is 4 at position (1,1).\n\nIf the pattern is that for each even element in the input, the corresponding block (i,j) is filled with the entire input matrix. So since there's only one even element at (1,1), the output's block (1,1) is filled with the input matrix, and other blocks are zeros.\n\nBut let's check the training examples. In Example0, the even elements are at (0,1) and (1,2). So blocks (0,1) and (1,2) would be filled. But in Example0's output, all diagonal blocks are filled, which are (0,0), (1,1), (2,2). So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each even element in the input matrix leads to the entire row of the input being placed in certain blocks. For example, in Example1, since row0 has three even elements, the entire row is placed in three blocks in grid row0. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the even elements in the input matrix determine how many times each row is repeated in the output. For example, the number of even elements in a row determines the number of repetitions. Let's check:\n\nExample0's row0 has 1 even element (8). So it's repeated once. But in Example0's output, row0 is repeated three times. Doesn't fit.\n\nExample1's row0 has three even elements \u2192 repeated three times. In the output, row0 appears in the first three rows (two copies) and the last three rows (three copies). So this doesn't fit.\n\nThis is really challenging. Let's try to think of the output for the test input based on the training examples. The test input has only one even element, 4 at (1,1). If the pattern is that each even element causes the input matrix to be placed in a certain block, then perhaps the block (1,1) is filled. \n\nBut looking at the training examples:\n\nExample1 has even elements, and the output has multiple blocks filled. Example2 has even elements, and output has certain blocks. The test input has one even element. So the output would have the input matrix in block (1,1), and other blocks zero.\n\nBut how to structure this. The output would be a 9x9 matrix where the middle block (rows3-5, columns3-5) contains the input matrix, and other blocks are zeros.\n\nBut let's look at Example2's input. The even elements are at (0,0), (1,0), (1,1), (1,2), (2,2). The output for Example2 has blocks (0,1), (0,2), (2,0), (2,1) filled. How does this relate to the even elements?\n\nNot directly. So this approach might not work.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and the lack of progress, I'll try to make an educated guess based on the test input and training examples.\n\nTest input has even element at (1,1). Looking at Example1, which has an even element at (1,2) (8). In Example1's output, the block (1,2) is filled with the input matrix's row1. But this might not be the pattern.\n\nAlternatively, the test input's even element is at (1,1). Maybe the output will have the input matrix placed in the middle block (1,1), and other blocks are zero. So the output would be a 9x9 matrix where the middle 3x3 block (rows3-5, columns3-5) contains the input matrix, and other elements are zero.\n\nBut according to Example0's input, which has even elements in other positions, the entire diagonal blocks are filled. So perhaps the even elements determine the diagonal blocks. If the test input has an even element in (1,1), then the middle diagonal block is filled.\n\nIn that case, the output would look like:\n\nRows0-2: zeros except middle block maybe? No, in Example0's case, each diagonal block is filled. So if the even element is at (1,1), then block (1,1) is filled. So the output would have the input matrix in rows3-5, columns3-5.\n\nBut how about other rows?\n\nWait, Example0's input has even elements in (0,1) and (1,2), but the output has all diagonal blocks filled. So maybe the presence of even elements in the input causes the diagonal blocks to be filled. But that doesn't explain Example1 and Example2.\n\nAlternatively, the number of even elements in the input determines how many diagonal blocks are filled. Example0 has two even elements \u2192 three diagonal blocks filled. Doesn't make sense.\n\nAlternatively, the diagonal blocks are filled if the sum of the diagonal elements is even. Example0's diagonal sum is 3+3+3=9 (odd). But the diagonal blocks are filled. So no.\n\nAnother idea: The output is constructed by placing the input matrix in certain blocks based on the parity of the row and column indices of the input elements. For example, even elements in the input cause the matrix to be placed in certain blocks. But without a clear pattern, this is hard to apply.\n\nGiven the time constraints, I'll proceed with the hypothesis that the output for the test input will have the input matrix placed in the middle block (1,1) because there's an even element at (1,1). But according to the training examples, this might not be correct. For instance, Example2's input has even elements but the middle block is not filled.\n\nAlternatively, the output's structure depends on the positions of even elements in the input matrix. For each even element at (i,j), the entire input matrix is placed in the output's block (i,j). For example, if the input has an even element at (1,1), then block (1,1) of the output is filled with the input matrix.\n\nTesting this with Example1:\n\nInput has even elements at (0,0), (0,1), (0,2), (1,2), (2,0), (2,1), (2,2). So the output's blocks (0,0), (0,1), (0,2), (1,2), (2,0), (2,1), (2,2) would be filled. Looking at Example1's output:\n\nGrid row0 has blocks (0,0) and (0,2) filled. So block (0,1) is not filled, but according to the hypothesis, it should be. So this is incorrect.\n\nExample0's input has even elements at (0,1) and (1,2). So blocks (0,1) and (1,2) should be filled. But Example0's output has diagonal blocks filled, which are (0,0), (1,1), (2,2). So this hypothesis is invalid.\n\nGiven that I can't find a clear pattern, I'll proceed to make an educated guess based on the examples.\n\nIn Example0, the output is three diagonal blocks of the input matrix. In Example1, the output is more complex, with blocks filled in various positions. In Example2, the output has blocks filled in non-diagonal positions.\n\nPerhaps the pattern is that each row of the input is placed in the output's rows in such a way that each block it's placed into corresponds to the row's index and the number of even elements in the row.\n\nAlternatively, the output is generated by tiling the input matrix in a 3x3 grid of blocks, where each block is the input matrix multiplied by 1 if the corresponding element in a certain matrix is even, and 0 otherwise.\n\nBut without a clear pattern, I'll have to make an educated guess.\n\nLooking at the test input:\n\n[1,1,7]\n\n[7,4,1]\n\n[5,1,7]\n\nThe only even element is 4 at (1,1). If the output's block (1,1) is filled with the input matrix, then the middle 3x3 block (rows3-5, columns3-5) would be the input matrix, and other blocks are zeros. \n\nSo the output would be a 9x9 matrix where:\n\nRows 3-5: each row is [0,0,0, input row0, 0,0,0], [0,0,0, input row1, 0,0,0], [0,0,0, input row2, 0,0,0].\n\nOther rows are zeros.\n\nBut according to the training examples, this doesn't seem to fit. For example, Example2's input has even elements, but the output has blocks filled in non-middle positions.\n\nAnother possibility is that the output is generated by placing the input matrix in blocks where the row and column indices sum to a certain value. For example, for the test input's even element at (1,1), sum i+j=2, so blocks where i+j=2 are filled. But this is speculative.\n\nAlternatively, the number of even elements in the input determines the number of repetitions of the input matrix in the output. Test input has one even \u2192 one copy. But in Example0, there are two even elements but three copies. So this isn't correct.\n\nGiven that I'm stuck, I'll try to generate the output for the test input based on the assumption that each even element's position corresponds to a block filled with the entire input matrix.\n\nSo the test input has even element at (1,1). So block (1,1) in the output's grid will have the input matrix. The rest are zeros.\n\nThus, the output would have the input matrix in the middle block (rows3-5, columns3-5), and zeros elsewhere.\n\nSo the output would be:\n\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n[0,0,0,1,1,7,0,0,0]\n[0,0,0,7,4,1,0,0,0]\n[0,0,0,5,1,7,0,0,0]\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nBut looking at the training examples, this isn't the case. For example, Example1's output has multiple blocks filled. So this approach might not be correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each even element causes the corresponding row to be placed in certain blocks. For example, in the test input, row1 has an even element (4). So row1 is placed in certain blocks. Let's assume that when a row has an even element, it's placed in the middle block. But how?\n\nAlternatively, the position of the even element within the row determines the block. For example, in row1, the even element is at position1. So the row is placed in block1 of grid row1. Which would be columns3-5. So row4 of the output (which is grid row1, row1) would be [0,0,0,7,4,1,0,0,0]. But how to structure the entire output.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and the need to provide an answer, I'll proceed with the following approach based on Example0 and the test input:\n\nThe output is a 3x3 grid of 3x3 blocks where the diagonal blocks are filled with the input matrix. However, this doesn't fit the other examples, but I'll proceed.\n\nTest input's output would be:\n\n[1,1,7,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n[7,4,1,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n[5,1,7,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n[0,0,0,1,1,7,0,0,0]\n[0,0,0,7,4,1,0,0,0]\n[0,0,0,5,1,7,0,0,0]\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,7]\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,7,4,1]\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,5,1,7]\n\nBut this matches Example0's pattern, which is diagonal blocks. However, Example0's input has even elements, and the test input's only even is in row1. So this might not be correct. But given the time, I'll proceed with this answer.",

        "cot_2": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. So, we have these training examples where the input is a 3x3 grid of numbers, and the output is a larger grid. Let's look at each example to see what's going on.\n\nStarting with Example 0. The input is three rows of three numbers each. The output is a 9x9 grid. Looking at the output rows, the original input rows are placed at the beginning, followed by zeros. Then there are rows that have the original input shifted to the right with zeros before and after. The next set of rows shifts them even further. It looks like the original 3x3 matrices are placed in blocks along the diagonal of a 3x3 block matrix, each block being 3x3. So, the first block is the original matrix in the top-left, the second block in the middle, and the third block at the bottom-right. But wait, each output block is a 3x3 matrix. Wait, no. The output has 9 rows, each with 9 elements. So the output is a 3x3 grid of 3x3 blocks. So each block is a 3x3 matrix. For example 0, the first three rows have the original matrix in the first block (top-left), then zeros in the middle and right blocks. The next three rows have the original matrix in the middle block, and the last three rows have it in the right-bottom block. So the output is three times the original in diagonal blocks, with zeros elsewhere.\n\nWait, but example 0's output has 9 rows. Each block is 3 rows. So the first three rows are the original matrix followed by two blocks of zeros. Then the next three rows are zeros, original, zeros. Then the last three rows are zeros, zeros, original. Oh right, so it's arranging the original matrix in three diagonal blocks of the 3x3 block matrix, each block being 3x3. So the output is a 3x3 tiling where each tile is 3x3, and the original matrix is placed along the diagonal tiles, others are zeros.\n\nBut looking at example 1. The input is again a 3x3 matrix. The output is 9 rows. Let's see the first three rows: [8,6,8,0,0,0,8,6,8]. Wait, that's the original row followed by zeros and then the original again. Then the next rows follow. Then the middle three rows have zeros except the last block. The last three rows have the original matrix repeated three times. So example 1's output seems to arrange the original matrix in different positions. Let's break it down.\n\nLooking at the output of example 1:\n\nFirst three rows: each row is original row + 3 zeros + original row again. So the first three rows have the original matrix in the first and third blocks. The next three rows (rows 4-6) are all zeros except the third block. Then the last three rows (7-9) have the original matrix in each block. Wait, but each row is [8,6,8,8,6,8,8,6,8]. So the first three elements are the original first row, then the same again, then again. So maybe the blocks are arranged such that each row is the original row repeated three times, with zeros in between. Hmm, but how does that fit into a pattern?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the pattern involves creating a larger matrix where each original row is replicated in certain positions. Let me see.\n\nIn example 0, each original row is placed in the first, fourth, and seventh positions (since each output row is 9 elements, so divided into three parts of three). So for the first three output rows, the first three elements are the input row, then three zeros, then three zeros. Then the next three rows (4-6) have three zeros, then the input row, then zeros. The last three rows (7-9) have zeros in the first two blocks and the input row in the third.\n\nSo each block corresponds to a position in a 3x3 grid of blocks, and each original matrix is placed along the diagonal. But example 0's output is three diagonal blocks. Example 1's output seems different. Let's check example 1's output structure.\n\nExample 1 input:\n\nOriginal rows:\n\nRow 0: 8,6,8\n\nRow 1:3,3,8\n\nRow 2:8,8,8\n\nOutput rows:\n\n[8,6,8,0,0,0,8,6,8]\n\n[3,3,8,0,0,0,3,3,8]\n\n[8,8,8,0,0,0,8,8,8]\n\nThen next three rows are all zeros except the last three elements, which are the original rows again.\n\nWait, the fourth row is [0,0,0,0,0,0,8,6,8]. So first six zeros, then the original first row. The fifth row is same but second row. Sixth row same but third row.\n\nThen the last three rows are [8,6,8,8,6,8,8,6,8], etc. So each row in the last three rows has the original row repeated three times. So the first three elements are the original row, then the same again, then again. So in the last three rows, all three blocks are filled with the original row.\n\nSo the blocks for example 1 are arranged as follows:\n\n- First three rows: first and third blocks have original rows, middle block is zeros.\n\nWait, but first three rows have original row in the first block (positions 0-2), then zeros (positions 3-5), then original row again (positions 6-8). So that's first and third blocks. The middle three rows (rows 3-5) have zeros in first two blocks (positions 0-5) and original in third block. The last three rows (6-8) have original row in all three blocks.\n\nSo this seems different from example 0. So perhaps the pattern isn't uniform across examples. So what's the underlying rule?\n\nAlternatively, maybe each example's output is created by tiling the original matrix in a certain way, possibly with overlapping or some transformation. Let's look for a pattern in the examples.\n\nAnother approach: the output is a 9x9 matrix formed by placing copies of the original 3x3 matrix in specific positions. Let's consider the output as a 3x3 grid of 3x3 blocks. For example, each block is either the original matrix or zeros.\n\nIn example 0, the diagonal blocks (top-left, middle, bottom-right) are the original matrix. Other blocks are zeros.\n\nIn example 1, the first row of blocks (top row) has the original matrix in the first and third blocks. The middle row has the original in the third block. The bottom row has the original in all three blocks.\n\nIn example 2, the first row of blocks (top) has the original in the middle and third blocks. The middle row is all zeros. The bottom row has the original in the first and middle blocks. Wait, let's check example 2's output.\n\nExample 2 output:\n\nFirst three rows: [0,0,0,6,9,9,6,9,9]\n\nSo the first block (0-2) is zeros, second block (3-5) is original first row, third block (6-8) is original first row again.\n\nWait, the original first row is [6,9,9], so yes. So first three rows have middle and third blocks as original rows.\n\nMiddle three rows (rows 3-5) are all zeros.\n\nLast three rows (6-8) have original rows in first and second blocks. For example, row 6 is [6,9,9,6,9,9,0,0,0], so first and second blocks (0-5) are original row 0, third block is zeros.\n\nSo the blocks in example 2 are arranged as:\n\nTop row: blocks 2 and 3 (middle and right) are original rows.\n\nMiddle row: all zeros.\n\nBottom row: blocks 0 and 1 (left and middle) are original rows.\n\nBut how do these arrangements relate to the input?\n\nLooking at the inputs:\n\nExample 0's input is:\n\n3 8 7\n\n9 3 8\n\n7 9 3\n\nWhich is a matrix where each row is a shifted version? Not sure. Maybe the diagonal elements are 3,3,3. But perhaps the arrangement in the output is based on some properties of the input.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is determined by the sum of the elements in the rows or some other feature.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the position where the original matrix is placed in the output depends on certain values in the input.\n\nWait, looking at example 1's input:\n\n8,6,8\n\n3,3,8\n\n8,8,8\n\nThe sum of each row:\n\nRow 0: 22\n\nRow 1: 14\n\nRow 2: 24\n\nBut I'm not sure how that would influence the output structure.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the elements themselves. For example, in example 1's input, the first row has two 8s and a 6. The output has the original matrix appearing in the first and third blocks of the first row, and in all blocks in the last row.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is determined by some pattern related to the digits in the input. For example, maybe the number of times a row is replicated or the position in the output depends on the sum modulo 3 or something like that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is a Kronecker product of the input matrix with another matrix. For example, in example 0, the output could be the Kronecker product with a 3x3 identity matrix. Because that would place the original matrix along the diagonal blocks. But example 1's output doesn't fit that pattern.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each element in the input matrix is used to determine where copies of the row are placed in the output.\n\nWait, let's look at example 1's output again. Each row in the output's first three rows is the original row followed by zeros and then the original row again. So each row is duplicated in the first and third blocks. Then in the middle three rows, the original row is in the third block. In the last three rows, each row is the original row repeated three times.\n\nSo for example, row 0 of the input is [8,6,8]. In the first output row (row 0), it's [8,6,8,0,0,0,8,6,8], which is the original row in block 0 and block 2. Then row 3 is [0,0,0,0,0,0,8,6,8], which is block 2. Then row 6 is [8,6,8,8,6,8,8,6,8], which is blocks 0, 1, 2.\n\nSo the position of the row in the output seems to be determined by the elements in the input row. For example, in example 1's first row of input is [3,3,8], and in the output rows 1, 4, 7, we have [3,3,8] in different blocks.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the first element of each row determines how many times the row is copied and where. For instance, in example 1's first row starts with 8. If 8 mod 3 is 2, maybe that's related to the positions. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, looking for a pattern in the output structure:\n\nIn example 0, each block is on the diagonal. Example 1's blocks are in positions (0,0), (0,2), (1,2), (2,0), (2,1), (2,2). Example 2's blocks are in (0,1), (0,2), (2,0), (2,1).\n\nBut how does this relate to the input?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by shifting the original matrix in some way. For example, in example 0, the output is a 3x3 grid of the original matrix placed along the diagonal. But example 1 and 2 have different arrangements.\n\nAnother approach: looking at the output rows as combinations of the input rows. For example, in example 0's output:\n\nEach of the first three rows is the input row followed by six zeros. Then the next three rows are three zeros, input row, three zeros. Then the last three rows are six zeros followed by input row.\n\nSo it's like stacking the input matrix three times, each shifted to a different diagonal block.\n\nIn example 1, the first three rows are input row + zeros + input row. The next three rows are zeros + zeros + input row. The last three rows are input row repeated three times.\n\nSo maybe the number of copies and their positions depend on some property of the input matrix. For example, in example 1's input, the first and third elements of each row are the same (like 8,6,8: first and third are 8). So maybe that determines that the row is placed in the first and third blocks. The middle row starts with 3, which may influence the placement in the third block. Then the last row is all 8s, so placed in all blocks.\n\nBut how to make sense of this? Let's look at example 2's input.\n\nExample 2's input:\n\n6,9,9\n\n4,6,8\n\n9,9,8\n\nOutput first three rows: [0,0,0,6,9,9,6,9,9]\n\nSo the middle block (positions 3-5) is the original row, and the third block (positions 6-8) is the original row again. So for the first row of the output, the original first row is placed in the middle and third blocks.\n\nThe middle three rows of the output are all zeros. The last three rows have the original rows in the first and second blocks.\n\nSo maybe the arrangement depends on the elements of the row. For example, the first element of each row determines where the row is placed.\n\nIn example 2's input:\n\nFirst row starts with 6. If 6 modulo 3 is 0, then maybe that's associated with the middle and third blocks (indices 1 and 2). Second row starts with 4, 4 mod 3 is 1, perhaps placed in the third block. Third row starts with 9 mod 3 is 0, maybe placed in first and second blocks.\n\nBut how to connect this to the output structure?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the sum of the elements in each row modulo 3 determines the positions. Let's check example 0:\n\nFirst row sum: 3+8+7=18 \u2192 18 mod 3=0.\n\nSecond row:9+3+8=20 \u2192 20 mod3=2.\n\nThird row:7+9+3=19 \u2192 19 mod3=1.\n\nBut the output for example 0's rows are placed in diagonal blocks, which would correspond to position (0,0), (1,1), (2,2) if sum mod3 is 0,2,1. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the first element modulo 3.\n\nExample 0's first element of rows: 3 mod3=0, 9 mod3=0,7 mod3=1.\n\nBut the output for example0 has each row placed in diagonal blocks. So the first row is in (0,0), second row in (1,1), third in (2,2). But 3 mod3=0 \u2192 row in position 0. 9 mod3=0 \u2192 row in position 0. 7 mod3=1 \u2192 row in position 1. That doesn't align.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the first element of the row indicates how many times the row is copied. For example, if the first element is 3, copied once, but example0's rows are copied once each in their diagonal positions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is constructed such that each row of the input is replicated in certain blocks of the output rows. For example, each output row is a combination of the input row placed in different positions, possibly multiple times.\n\nBut I'm getting stuck. Let's try to look for a different approach.\n\nLooking at the dimensions: input is 3x3, output is 9x9. So each input element is somehow expanded into a 3x3 block.\n\nWait, 3x3 input to 9x9 output. So each element in the input becomes a 3x3 block in the output. That's a common pattern in image processing, like kernel operations. But how?\n\nFor example, if each number in the input is replaced by a 3x3 matrix where the original number is in a certain position, and others are zeros. But how does that explain the examples?\n\nTake example0's input matrix:\n\n3 8 7\n\n9 3 8\n\n7 9 3\n\nIn the output, the first three rows are:\n\n[3,8,7,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\n[9,3,8,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\n[7,9,3,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nWhich can be seen as the original matrix followed by two 3x3 zero matrices.\n\nThe next three rows are zeros, then the original, then zeros.\n\nThe last three rows are zeros, zeros, original.\n\nSo it's as if the output is a block diagonal matrix with three copies of the original matrix.\n\nBut example1's output is not block diagonal. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is a Kronecker product with a certain matrix. The Kronecker product of two matrices A and B is a block matrix where each element a_ij of A is replaced by a_ij * B. For example, if the input matrix is A, and B is a 3x3 matrix, then the Kronecker product A \u2297 B would be a 9x9 matrix.\n\nIn example0, if B is the identity matrix, then the Kronecker product would place A along the diagonal blocks, which matches example0. However, example1's output doesn't fit that pattern.\n\nAlternatively, the Kronecker product with a different matrix. For example, example1's output seems to have A repeated in certain blocks. Let's see:\n\nExample1's output first three rows have A in positions 0 and 2 (assuming blocks are 3x3). So the first row is A, 0, A. Then the second row is same pattern. Then the third row same.\n\nThen the next three rows are 0, 0, A. Then the last three rows are A, A, A.\n\nSo perhaps B is a 3x3 matrix that for example0 is the identity matrix, for example1 it's:\n\n[1 0 1]\n\n[0 0 1]\n\n[1 1 1]\n\nBut that seems ad-hoc. How would B be determined from the input matrix?\n\nAlternatively, maybe each element in the input determines the corresponding block in the output. For example, each element in the input matrix is replaced by a 3x3 block that depends on the value of the element. But in example0, the output is three copies of the entire input matrix along the diagonal. So maybe not.\n\nAnother angle: Let's think of the output as a 3x3 grid of 3x3 blocks. Each block can be either the original matrix or zeros. The arrangement of which blocks are original and which are zero depends on the input matrix.\n\nFor example, in example0, the diagonal blocks are original, others zero. In example1, the blocks in positions (0,0), (0,2), (1,2), (2,0), (2,1), (2,2) are original. In example2, blocks (0,1), (0,2), (2,0), (2,1) are original.\n\nBut how to determine which blocks are filled based on the input?\n\nLooking at example1's input matrix:\n\n[8,6,8]\n\n[3,3,8]\n\n[8,8,8]\n\nEach element in the input matrix might influence whether the corresponding block in the output is filled. For example, if the element is even, fill a certain block.\n\nAlternatively, the sum of each row's elements modulo 3 determines the column index of the block where the row is placed.\n\nFor example0's first row sum is 18 \u2192 0 mod3. Column 0. Second row sum 20 \u2192 2 mod3 \u2192 column2. Third row sum 19 \u2192 1 mod3 \u2192 column1. But the output has each row in diagonal blocks. So maybe the row index and column index are determined by some property of the row.\n\nAlternatively, the first element of each row determines the column. For example, in example0's first row starts with 3 \u2192 3 mod3=0, so column0. Second row starts with9 mod3=0, but in the output, the second row's block is in column1? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each row is replicated in the output based on the elements of the row.\n\nIn example1, each row of the input is replicated three times in certain positions. For instance, the first row [8,6,8] appears in the first and third blocks of the first output row, then in the third block of the fourth output row, and in all blocks of the seventh output row.\n\nBut how is this determined?\n\nAnother idea: maybe the output is a 3x3 grid of 3x3 blocks, where each block is the original matrix multiplied by a certain factor (1 or 0) based on the position. The factors could be determined by some function of the input matrix.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each block in the output corresponds to a certain element in the input matrix, scaled up. But not sure.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the test input and trying to see what the output would be. Let's think about the test input:\n\nTest Input:\n\n[1,1,7]\n\n[7,4,1]\n\n[5,1,7]\n\nWe need to apply the pattern from the training examples. Let's look at the training examples again.\n\nLooking at example0 and example2, the output structure varies based on the input. The key is to find what differs between them that causes the different output structures.\n\nIn example0, the output has the original matrix along the diagonal blocks. Example1's output has a more complex arrangement, with multiple blocks filled. Example2's output has blocks filled in certain positions and others zeros.\n\nWait, perhaps the pattern is that the output is formed by placing the original matrix in certain quadrants of the output based on the sum of each row. For example, the sum of each row determines which quadrant (block) the row is placed in.\n\nBut example0's first row sum is 18, which is divisible by 3. So maybe placed in the first block. Second row sum 20, which modulo3 is 2, placed in the third block. Third row sum 19 modulo3 is 1, placed in the middle block. But example0's output has each row placed in diagonal blocks. So perhaps each row is placed in a specific block based on some row-based calculation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is a 3x3 block matrix where each block is the original matrix multiplied by a certain factor. For example, example0's output is the original matrix in diagonal blocks and zero elsewhere. That would be the identity matrix multiplied by the original. Example1's output has a different pattern. So maybe the multiplier is determined by some other condition.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is the result of a convolution operation. But not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the pattern involves rotating or shifting the original matrix and placing it in certain blocks. For example, in example0, the matrix is placed as is in diagonal blocks. In example1, after certain rotations.\n\nBut example1's output doesn't look like rotations.\n\nAnother approach: think of the output as a larger matrix where each row is a combination of the original rows in some way. For example, in example0's first row of output is the original row followed by zeros. Then the next rows are the same. Then the middle rows have zeros followed by original rows. So perhaps the output is a block matrix where each block is the original matrix shifted by certain steps.\n\nAlternatively, the output is generated by arranging three copies of the input matrix in a particular layout. For example, in example0, three copies along the diagonal. In example1, copies in certain positions. But how are these positions determined?\n\nAlternatively, looking at the numbers in the input matrix. For example, example1 has a lot of 8's. Maybe the presence of certain numbers determines the layout.\n\nBut I'm not seeing the connection. Let's try to find a pattern between the input and the output structures.\n\nIn example0, the output is three diagonal blocks. Example1's output has non-diagonal blocks filled. Example2's output has some blocks filled.\n\nLooking at example1's input, the first row is [8,6,8]. The output's first three rows have this row in the first and third blocks. The middle three rows have it in the third block. The last three rows have it in all three blocks.\n\nSo perhaps the position in the output depends on the elements in the input row. For example, if the row has duplicate elements, it's placed in multiple blocks.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the first element of the row. For example, in example1's first row, the first element is 8. If we take 8 mod 3 = 2, maybe that corresponds to the third block (0-based index 2). So the row is placed in block 2. But why is it also placed in block0?\n\nHmm, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the number of times a row is copied depends on the number of unique elements in the row. For example, example1's first row has two unique elements (8,6), so maybe two copies. But in the output, it's copied three times (first, third, and in all blocks).\n\nAlternatively, the sum of the row modulo 3 determines how many times it's copied. Example0's first row sum 18 mod3=0. Example0's first row is copied once. But example1's first row sum 22 mod3=1, copied three times.\n\nThis isn't adding up.\n\nLet's try to think differently. Each training example's output has a certain number of copies of the input rows in different blocks. The pattern must relate to the input's structure.\n\nAnother observation: in example0's input, each row has distinct elements except the third row. Example0's input matrix:\n\n3,8,7\n\n9,3,8\n\n7,9,3\n\nNotice that the diagonal elements are 3,3,3. So the main diagonal is all 3. Maybe this influences the diagonal blocks in the output.\n\nExample1's input matrix:\n\n8,6,8\n\n3,3,8\n\n8,8,8\n\nHere, the main diagonal is 8,3,8. So maybe the output's blocks are determined by the diagonal elements. But example1's output has the first and third blocks filled in the first three rows.\n\nAlternatively, the diagonal elements of the input matrix determine the positions in the output. For example, in example0, the diagonal is all 3s, and the output has the matrix along the diagonal blocks. In example1, the diagonal elements are 8,3,8. Maybe even numbers determine certain positions. But 3 is odd, so not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the diagonal elements modulo 3. For example0: 3 mod3=0, 3 mod3=0, 3 mod3=0. So all 0, which corresponds to the diagonal blocks. Example1's diagonal elements: 8 mod3=2,3 mod3=0,8 mod3=2. So maybe 0 and 2 positions. How would that translate to the output blocks?\n\nAlternatively, the number of times a row is copied in the output depends on the number of times the first element appears in that row. For example, in example1's first row, the first element is 8, which appears twice in the row. So maybe two copies. But the output has three copies of the row in different blocks. So not sure.\n\nAnother idea: the output is constructed such that each block corresponds to a row and column index derived from the original matrix's elements. For example, each element in the input matrix determines whether a certain block in the output is filled.\n\nBut how to map 3x3 input elements to 9x9 output blocks?\n\nAlternatively, each element in the input determines a 3x3 block in the output. For example, the element at (i,j) in the input determines the block at (i,j) in the output. If the element is even, the block is filled with the original row; if odd, zeros. But in example0, the input has 3 (odd), 8 (even), etc. Let's check.\n\nExample0's input first row: 3 (odd), 8 (even), 7 (odd). If even elements cause the block to be filled, then blocks (0,1) would be filled. But example0's output has diagonal blocks filled. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, the value of the element determines the row and column offset in the output. For example, each element's value modulo 3 gives an offset, and the original matrix is placed in that offset block.\n\nBut this seems complicated.\n\nAlternatively, think of the output as the input matrix being replicated in certain quadrants. For example, if the sum of the matrix is even, replicate in certain quadrants. But example0's sum is 3+8+7+9+3+8+7+9+3 = 3+8+7=18; 9+3+8=20; 7+9+3=19. Total sum 18+20+19=57, which is odd. Example1's sum is 8+6+8=22; 3+3+8=14; 8+8+8=24. Total 22+14+24=60, even. Example2's sum is 6+9+9=24; 4+6+8=18;9+9+8=26. Total 24+18+26=68, even. But example0's output has diagonal blocks, example1's has more complex blocks. Not sure.\n\nAnother observation: the number of non-zero blocks in the output varies between examples. Example0 has 3 non-zero blocks (diagonal). Example1 has 6 non-zero blocks. Example2 has 4 non-zero blocks.\n\nHmm. So the pattern must be determined by something in the input that varies between examples.\n\nAlternatively, the output is constructed by horizontally concatenating the original matrix with itself, with certain spacing of zeros. For example, example0's output is the original matrix followed by two zero matrices in the first three rows. But that doesn't explain the other rows.\n\nWait, let's look at example1's output:\n\nThe first three rows are the original row, then zeros, then original row again. So the row is concatenated three times with zeros in between. Then in the middle three rows, only the third copy is present. In the last three rows, all three copies are present.\n\nThis resembles a fractal pattern or some kind of expansion where each row is placed in specific positions based on the original elements.\n\nAlternatively, the output is generated by a recursive process. For example, each element in the input determines a 3x3 block in the output, which could be filled with the original matrix or zeros. But this is vague.\n\nAnother approach: Let's look for the number of repetitions of the original rows in each output row. In example0, each output row has the original row once, in different positions. In example1, some rows have the original row twice or thrice. In example2, some rows have the original row twice.\n\nSo perhaps the number of times a row is copied into the output depends on the elements of the row. For example, if a row has duplicate numbers, it's copied more times.\n\nExample0's rows:\n\nRow0: 3,8,7 \u2192 all unique \u2192 copied once.\n\nRow1:9,3,8 \u2192 all unique \u2192 copied once.\n\nRow2:7,9,3 \u2192 all unique \u2192 copied once.\n\nBut example0's output has each row copied once in each block. So maybe not.\n\nExample1's row0: 8,6,8 \u2192 two duplicates. Copied twice in the first three rows.\n\nBut in example1's output, row0 is copied three times (first and third blocks in first three rows, then again in last three rows). So that's three copies.\n\nHmm, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the number of zeros between copies of the original row in the output may be related to the elements of the input. For example, in example1's row0, there are two 8's, so two copies in the first three rows. But not sure.\n\nAnother observation: the output in each example is a 9x9 matrix composed of the input matrix repeated in certain positions, with zeros elsewhere. The challenge is to determine which positions to fill based on the input.\n\nLooking for a pattern in the filled positions:\n\nExample0's filled blocks: (0,0), (1,1), (2,2).\n\nExample1's filled blocks: (0,0), (0,2), (1,2), (2,0), (2,1), (2,2).\n\nExample2's filled blocks: (0,1), (0,2), (2,0), (2,1).\n\nThe filled blocks seem to form letters or numbers. For example, example1's filled blocks may form the letter 'A' or another shape, but this is speculative.\n\nAlternatively, the positions where the original matrix is placed are determined by the sum of the input matrix's elements. For example, in example0, sum is 57, which may correspond to the diagonal blocks. But without more data, it's hard to see.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is a 3x3 grid of blocks, where each block is filled if the corresponding element in the input matrix meets a certain condition (like being even).\n\nExample0's input matrix:\n\nRow0:3 (odd),8 (even),7 (odd).\n\nRow1:9 (odd),3 (odd),8 (even).\n\nRow2:7 (odd),9 (odd),3 (odd).\n\nIn example0's output, the diagonal blocks are filled. So (0,0), (1,1), (2,2). The elements at those positions in the input are 3 (odd),3 (odd),3 (odd). So maybe odd elements in diagonal positions lead to filled blocks.\n\nBut example1's input diagonal elements are 8 (even),3 (odd),8 (even). The filled blocks are (0,0), (0,2), (1,2), (2,0), (2,1), (2,2). So for (0,0) in example1's input, the element is 8 (even), so maybe even elements lead to certain blocks being filled.\n\nBut this doesn't align with example2's input.\n\nExample2's input matrix:\n\nRow0:6 (even),9 (odd),9 (odd).\n\nRow1:4 (even),6 (even),8 (even).\n\nRow2:9 (odd),9 (odd),8 (even).\n\nThe filled blocks in example2's output are (0,1), (0,2), (2,0), (2,1). The elements at (0,1) is 9 (odd), (0,2) is9 (odd), (2,0) is9 (odd), (2,1) is9 (odd). So if the condition is that the element is odd, then those positions would be filled. But how does that relate to the output blocks?\n\nAlternatively, for each block (i,j) in the output's 3x3 block grid, if the input's element at (i,j) meets a certain condition, then the block is filled with the original matrix.\n\nFor example, in example0's input, the diagonal elements are 3,3,3. If the condition is that the element is 3, then the diagonal blocks are filled. That matches example0's output.\n\nIn example1's input, the elements at (0,0) is8, (0,2) is8, (1,2) is8, (2,0) is8, (2,1) is8, (2,2) is8. So if the condition is element is 8, then the blocks where the input's elements are 8 are filled. Indeed, example1's output has the original matrix in those blocks. Let's check:\n\nExample1's input:\n\nRow0: [8,6,8] \u2192 elements at positions (0,0)=8, (0,2)=8.\n\nRow1: [3,3,8] \u2192 (1,2)=8.\n\nRow2: [8,8,8] \u2192 (2,0)=8, (2,1)=8, (2,2)=8.\n\nSo in the output's block grid, the blocks corresponding to input positions where the element is 8 are filled with the original matrix. This seems to fit example1's output.\n\nExample0's input has elements 3,3,3 on the diagonal. So the blocks (0,0), (1,1), (2,2) are filled.\n\nExample2's input has:\n\nRow0: [6,9,9] \u2192 9s at positions (0,1), (0,2).\n\nRow1: [4,6,8] \u2192 no 9s.\n\nRow2: [9,9,8] \u2192 9s at (2,0), (2,1).\n\nSo the blocks corresponding to positions (0,1), (0,2), (2,0), (2,1) in the input are filled with the original matrix. Which matches example2's output.\n\nYes! This seems to be the pattern. The output is a 3x3 grid of 3x3 blocks. Each block (i,j) in the output's block grid is filled with the original matrix if and only if the corresponding element in the input matrix (at position i,j) is a certain value. In example0, the input matrix's diagonal elements are all 3, so those blocks are filled. In example1, the input matrix's elements that are 8 trigger their corresponding blocks to be filled. In example2, the input elements that are 9 trigger their blocks to be filled.\n\nSo the pattern is:\n\nFor each element (i,j) in the input matrix, if that element is equal to a certain target number (like 3 in example0, 8 in example1, 9 in example2), then the corresponding 3x3 block in the output's 3x3 block grid is filled with the original input matrix. All other blocks are filled with zeros.\n\nSo the target number is determined by the input matrix. It seems that the target number is the most frequent number in the input matrix. \n\nLooking at example0: input has 3 appearing three times, 8 three times, 7 three times, 9 three times. Wait, example0's input is:\n\n3,8,7\n\n9,3,8\n\n7,9,3\n\nSo elements are 3,8,7,9, etc. The number 3 appears three times. 8 appears three times. 7 appears two times. 9 appears two times. So there's a tie between 3 and 8. But the target number for example0 is 3, as the diagonal blocks are filled. So perhaps the target number is the value of the element in the top-left corner (i=0,j=0). For example0, that's 3. For example1, it's 8. For example2, it's 6. But example2's target number seems to be 9. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, the target number is the maximum value in the input matrix. Example0's maximum is 9. But example0's filled blocks are for 3. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, the target number is the value that appears in the middle of the input matrix. Example0's middle element is 3. Example1's middle element is 3. Example2's middle element is6. But example1's target is8. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, the target number is the majority number in the input matrix. For example1's input has 8 appearing six times (rows 0: two 8s, row1: one 8, row2: three 8s. Total 6). Other numbers: 3 appears three times, 6 once. So majority is8. Example2's input has 9 appearing four times (row0: two, row2: two), 8 twice, 6 twice. So majority is9. Example0's input has 3 three times, 8 three times, 7 two times, 9 two times. So tie between3 and8. But example0's target was3. So maybe the majority number is the target, and in case of tie, the first occurring number.\n\nSo the pattern is: for each element in the input matrix, if the element's value is equal to the most frequent number in the input (breaking ties by occurrence order), then the corresponding block in the output is filled with the original matrix. Otherwise, zeros.\n\nLet's test this:\n\nExample0's input:\n\n3 appears three times, 8 three times, 7 two,9 two. So the target is3 (first occurrence in case of tie). So blocks where input elements are3 are filled. Looking at the input matrix:\n\nRow0: 3 is at (0,0).\n\nRow1:3 is at (1,1).\n\nRow2:3 is at (2,2).\n\nSo the diagonal blocks are filled. Which matches example0's output.\n\nExample1's input:\n\n8 appears six times (rows 0: two, row1: one, row2: three). So target is8. The input elements that are8 are:\n\n(0,0), (0,2), (1,2), (2,0), (2,1), (2,2). So those blocks are filled with the original matrix. Which matches example1's output.\n\nExample2's input:\n\n9 appears four times (row0: two, row2: two). So target is9. The input elements that are9 are:\n\n(0,1), (0,2), (2,0), (2,1). So those blocks are filled. Which matches example2's output.\n\nYes, this fits all examples. So the pattern is:\n\n1. Determine the most frequent number in the input matrix. In case of a tie, pick the one that appears first in row-major order.\n\n2. Create a 9x9 output matrix which is a 3x3 grid of 3x3 blocks.\n\n3. For each block (i,j) in the output's block grid, if the input matrix's element at (i,j) is equal to the target number, then fill that block with the original input matrix. Otherwise, fill with zeros.\n\nSo for the test input:\n\nTest Input:\n\n[1,1,7]\n\n[7,4,1]\n\n[5,1,7]\n\nFirst, find the most frequent number. Let's count:\n\n1 appears in positions (0,0), (0,1), (1,2), (2,1) \u2192 four times.\n\n7 appears in positions (0,2), (1,0), (2,2) \u2192 three times.\n\n4 appears once (1,1).\n\n5 appears once (2,0).\n\nSo the most frequent number is 1. \n\nNow, identify the positions (i,j) in the input matrix where the element is 1:\n\nRow0: (0,0), (0,1)\n\nRow1: (1,2)\n\nRow2: (2,1)\n\nSo the blocks to fill are (0,0), (0,1), (1,2), (2,1).\n\nEach of these blocks in the output's 3x3 block grid will be filled with the original input matrix. All other blocks are zeros.\n\nSo the output will be a 9x9 matrix where:\n\n- Blocks (0,0), (0,1), (1,2), (2,1) are filled with the input matrix.\n\n- Other blocks are zeros.\n\nNow, construct the output step by step.\n\nThe output is divided into 3 rows of blocks, each block being 3x3.\n\nEach block row is three rows in the output.\n\nBlock (0,0):\n\nFirst three rows of the output will have the input matrix in the first block (columns 0-2), and other blocks filled according to whether their block is active.\n\nBut since only (0,0) and (0,1) are active in row0 of blocks, the first three rows will have the input matrix in the first two blocks (0-2 and 3-5) if both (0,0) and (0,1) are active. Wait, no. Each block is 3x3. Block (i,j) corresponds to the j-th block in the i-th block row.\n\nWait, the output is a 3x3 grid of blocks. Each block is 3x3. For example, block (0,0) is the top-left 3x3 matrix. Block (0,1) is the top-middle 3x3 matrix. Block (0,2) is top-right. Similarly for other rows.\n\nSo for each block (i,j) in the 3x3 block grid:\n\nIf the input's element at (i,j) is 1, then the block is filled with the input matrix. Else, filled with zeros.\n\nNow, for the test input:\n\nInput matrix:\n\nRow0: [1,1,7]\n\nRow1: [7,4,1]\n\nRow2: [5,1,7]\n\nPositions where element is 1:\n\n(0,0), (0,1), (1,2), (2,1).\n\nSo blocks (0,0), (0,1), (1,2), (2,1) are filled with the input matrix.\n\nLet's construct each block row:\n\nBlock row 0 (output rows 0-2):\n\n- Block (0,0): filled with input matrix.\n\n- Block (0,1): filled with input matrix.\n\n- Block (0,2): zeros.\n\nSo each row in the first three output rows will be input row followed by input row followed by zeros.\n\nFor example, output row0:\n\n[1,1,7,1,1,7,0,0,0]\n\nSimilarly for rows1 and2.\n\nBlock row1 (output rows3-5):\n\n- Block (1,0): zeros.\n\n- Block (1,1): zeros.\n\n- Block (1,2): filled with input matrix.\n\nSo output rows3-5 will be zeros in first two blocks and input matrix in the third block.\n\nFor example, output row3:\n\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,7]\n\nRow4: [0,0,0,0,0,0,7,4,1]\n\nRow5: [0,0,0,0,0,0,5,1,7]\n\nBlock row2 (output rows6-8):\n\n- Block (2,0): zeros.\n\n- Block (2,1): filled with input matrix.\n\n- Block (2,2): zeros.\n\nSo output rows6-8 will have zeros in first and third blocks, and input matrix in the middle block.\n\nFor example, output row6:\n\n[0,0,0,1,1,7,0,0,0]\n\nRow7: [0,0,0,7,4,1,0,0,0]\n\nRow8: [0,0,0,5,1,7,0,0,0]\n\nPutting it all together, the output should be:\n\n[1,1,7,1,1,7,0,0,0]\n\n[7,4,1,7,4,1,0,0,0]\n\n[5,1,7,5,1,7,0,0,0]\n\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,7]\n\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,7,4,1]\n\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,5,1,7]\n\n[0,0,0,1,1,7,0,0,0]\n\n[0,0,0,7,4,1,0,0,0]\n\n[0,0,0,5,1,7,0,0,0]\n\nThis matches the pattern observed in the training examples."
