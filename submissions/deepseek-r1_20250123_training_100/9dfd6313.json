        "cot_1": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. So, looking at the training examples, I need to see how the input matrices are transformed into the output. Let's start with Example 0.\n\nIn Example 0, the input is:\n\n[5, 0, 0]\n[3, 5, 0]\n[0, 0, 5]\n\nAnd the output is:\n\n[5, 3, 0]\n[0, 5, 0]\n[0, 0, 5]\n\nHmm, so the first row in the output takes the 3 from the second row's first element. The second row's first element becomes 0. Wait, maybe this is a transpose operation, but only for certain elements. Let me check.\n\nOriginal matrix (input) for Example 0:\n\nRow 0: [5,0,0]\nRow 1: [3,5,0]\nRow 2: [0,0,5]\n\nOutput matrix:\n\nRow 0: [5,3,0]\nRow 1: [0,5,0]\nRow 2: [0,0,5]\n\nLooking at the positions, the element at (1,0) in the input (which is 3) moves to (0,1) in the output. The rest of the diagonal elements (5,5,5) remain the same. So maybe non-diagonal elements are being transposed? But only those in the lower triangle?\n\nWait, in the output, the 3 is now in row 0, column 1. So the transpose of the lower triangle (excluding the diagonal) is being moved to the upper triangle. So for each element below the diagonal (i > j), they are moved to (j, i). Let me check that.\n\nIn Example 0, the input has 3 at (1,0), which is below the diagonal. The output puts 3 at (0,1). So yes, that's swapping (i,j) to (j,i) for elements below the diagonal. Then, the original upper triangle (excluding diagonal) remains zero? Wait, in the input, the upper triangle (elements where j > i) are all zero. So after transposing the lower elements to the upper, the lower part becomes zero. So the output matrix is a combination of the original diagonal and the transposed lower elements into the upper triangle, and zeros elsewhere.\n\nWait, let's look at Example 1:\n\nInput:\n\n[5, 0, 0, 0]\n[0, 5, 0, 0]\n[6, 0, 5, 0]\n[6, 0, 4, 5]\n\nOutput:\n\n[5, 0, 6, 6]\n[0, 5, 0, 0]\n[0, 0, 5, 4]\n[0, 0, 0, 5]\n\nHere, the input has 6 at (2,0) and (3,0), and 4 at (3,2). The output places 6s at (0,2) and (0,3), and 4 at (2,3). So again, elements below the diagonal (i > j) are moved to (j,i). Let's verify:\n\nOriginal elements below the diagonal:\n\nRow 1: No elements (since j=0 is 0, which is same as i=1? No, wait, row index starts at 0. So for row 2 (i=2), elements at j=0 and j=1. Wait, j can't be greater than i here. Wait, elements where i > j. For example, in row 2 (i=2), j=0 and 1 are less than i. So elements at (2,0)=6, (3,0)=6, (3,1)=0, (3,2)=4. These would be moved to (0,2), (0,3), (1,3), (2,3) respectively. But in the output, (0,2) is 6, (0,3) is 6, (2,3) is 4. The (3,1) in input is 0, so in output (1,3) is 0, but in the output, the (0,1) is 0. Hmm, but in the input, the (3,1) is 0, so when transposed, it becomes (1,3) which is 0. So the output has (1,3) as 0. But in the output's row 1, the elements are [0,5,0,0], so (1,3) is indeed 0. So that makes sense.\n\nSo the pattern seems to be: For each element in the lower triangle (i > j), move it to the transposed position (j,i), and set the original position to 0. The diagonal remains the same. The upper triangle (originally j > i) would get the transposed elements from the lower triangle, and the original lower triangle becomes zero. Wait, no. Because in Example 0, the original upper triangle (elements where j > i) are all zeros. After transposing the lower elements to upper, those positions become the transposed values, and the lower triangle is zeroed out except for the diagonal. So the output matrix is such that the upper triangle (including the diagonal) is the original diagonal plus the transposed lower elements, and the lower triangle (excluding diagonal) is zero.\n\nSo the transformation is: Take the original matrix, transpose the elements that are below the diagonal (i > j) into their symmetric positions above the diagonal (j,i), and set the lower triangle elements (i > j) to zero. The diagonal remains the same. So the result is a matrix where the upper triangle (including diagonal) is the diagonal plus the transposed lower elements, and the lower triangle is zero.\n\nLet me check Example 2:\n\nInput:\n\n[5,0,0,0,0]\n[0,5,0,0,0]\n[8,8,5,0,0]\n[0,2,0,5,0]\n[0,2,0,1,5]\n\nOutput:\n\n[5,0,8,0,0]\n[0,5,8,2,2]\n[0,0,5,0,0]\n[0,0,0,5,1]\n[0,0,0,0,5]\n\nSo in the input, the lower triangle elements are:\n\nRow 2 (i=2): j=0 (8), j=1 (8)\nRow 3 (i=3): j=0 (0), j=1 (2), j=2 (0)\nRow 4 (i=4): j=0 (0), j=1 (2), j=2 (0), j=3 (1)\n\nTransposing these:\n\n(2,0) \u2192 (0,2) \u2192 8\n(2,1) \u2192 (1,2) \u21928\n(3,0) \u2192 (0,3) \u21920\n(3,1) \u2192 (1,3) \u21922\n(3,2) \u2192 (2,3) \u21920\n(4,0) \u2192 (0,4) \u21920\n(4,1) \u2192 (1,4) \u21922\n(4,2) \u2192 (2,4) \u21920\n(4,3) \u2192 (3,4) \u21921\n\nLooking at the output:\n\nRow 0: [5,0,8,0,0] \u2192 (0,2) is 8, (0,3) is 0, (0,4) is 0. So the 8 from (2,0) is here, others are 0 as per input.\n\nRow 1: [0,5,8,2,2]. So (1,2) is 8 (from input (2,1)), (1,3)=2 (from input (3,1)), (1,4)=2 (from input (4,1)).\n\nRow 2: [0,0,5,0,0]. (2,3)=0 (from input (3,2) which was 0), (2,4)=0 (from input (4,2)=0).\n\nRow 3: [0,0,0,5,1]. (3,4)=1 (from input (4,3)=1).\n\nSo yes, the transposed elements are moved, and the lower triangle becomes zero except for the diagonal. That matches.\n\nSo the pattern is to transpose the elements below the diagonal (i > j) into their symmetric positions (j, i) above the diagonal, set the lower elements (i > j) to zero, and keep the diagonal as is.\n\nNow, applying this to the Test Input:\n\nTest Input:\n\n[5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[3, 3, 5, 0, 0, 0]\n[0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0]\n[2, 0, 8, 8, 5, 0]\n[2, 0, 6, 0, 0, 5]\n\nWe need to transpose elements where i > j. Let's list all such elements:\n\nFor each row i, j from 0 to i-1.\n\nRow 0: i=0, no elements (j can't be < 0).\nRow 1: i=1, j=0 \u2192 value is 0.\nRow 2: i=2, j=0 \u21923; j=1\u21923.\nRow 3: i=3, j=0\u21920; j=1\u21920; j=2\u21920.\nRow 4: i=4, j=0\u21922; j=1\u21920; j=2\u21928; j=3\u21928.\nRow 5: i=5, j=0\u21922; j=1\u21920; j=2\u21926; j=3\u21920; j=4\u21920.\n\nNow, transpose these elements to their (j,i) positions and set the original (i,j) to zero.\n\nSo:\n\nFor Row 2 (i=2):\n\nj=0 \u21923 \u2192 moved to (0,2)\nj=1 \u21923 \u2192 moved to (1,2)\n\nRow4 (i=4):\n\nj=0\u21922 \u2192 (0,4)\nj=2\u21928 \u2192 (2,4)\nj=3\u21928 \u2192 (3,4)\n\nRow5 (i=5):\n\nj=0\u21922 \u2192 (0,5)\nj=2\u21926 \u2192 (2,5)\nj=3\u21920 \u2192 (3,5)\nj=4\u21920 \u2192 (4,5)\n\nNow, the original elements in these positions (j,i) may have existing values, but according to the examples, they are replaced by the transposed ones. Wait, but in the input matrices, the upper triangle (j > i) are all zeros in the training examples. So the test input's upper triangle may have zeros, which will be replaced by the transposed lower elements.\n\nSo let's construct the output matrix:\n\nStart with all zeros except the diagonal.\n\nOriginal diagonal elements are 5 in all cases. Then, for each element in lower triangle (i > j), move to (j,i).\n\nSo the output matrix would have:\n\nRow 0: [5,0,3,0,2,2] (from j=0: elements transposed from rows 2,4,5 at j=0)\nRow 1: [0,5,3,0,0,0] (from j=1: elements from row2 j=1)\nRow 2: [0,0,5,0,8,6] (elements from row4 j=2 and row5 j=2)\nRow 3: [0,0,0,5,8,0] (elements from row4 j=3 and row5 j=3)\nRow 4: [0,0,0,0,5,0] (elements from row5 j=4)\nRow5: [0,0,0,0,0,5]\n\nWait, but let's check each position:\n\nLooking at the transposed elements:\n\nFrom (2,0)=3 \u2192 (0,2)\nFrom (2,1)=3 \u2192 (1,2)\nFrom (4,0)=2 \u2192 (0,4)\nFrom (4,2)=8 \u2192 (2,4)\nFrom (4,3)=8 \u2192 (3,4)\nFrom (5,0)=2 \u2192 (0,5)\nFrom (5,2)=6 \u2192 (2,5)\nFrom (5,3)=0 \u2192 (3,5)\nFrom (5,4)=0 \u2192 (4,5)\n\nSo:\n\nRow 0:\n\nOriginal first element is 5 (diagonal). Then, elements at j=2:3 (from row2), j=4:2 (from row4), j=5:2 (from row5). So positions (0,2)=3, (0,4)=2, (0,5)=2. The other positions (j=1,3) remain 0.\n\nSo row0: [5,0,3,0,2,2]\n\nRow1:\n\nOriginal 5 at (1,1). Then, j=2 gets 3 from row2's j=1. So (1,2)=3. Others are 0.\n\nRow1: [0,5,3,0,0,0]\n\nRow2:\n\nOriginal 5 at (2,2). Then, from row4's j=2:8 \u2192 (2,4)=8. From row5's j=2:6 \u2192 (2,5)=6. So row2: [0,0,5,0,8,6]\n\nRow3:\n\nOriginal 5 at (3,3). From row4's j=3:8 \u2192 (3,4)=8. From row5's j=3:0 \u2192 (3,5)=0. So row3: [0,0,0,5,8,0]\n\nRow4:\n\nOriginal 5 at (4,4). From row5's j=4:0 \u2192 (4,5)=0. So row4: [0,0,0,0,5,0]\n\nRow5:\n\nDiagonal remains 5. Others are zero.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\n[5, 0, 3, 0, 2, 2]\n[0, 5, 3, 0, 0, 0]\n[0, 0, 5, 0, 8, 6]\n[0, 0, 0, 5, 8, 0]\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0]\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5]\n\nWait, but looking at the examples, the outputs have the same diagonal and the transposed elements in the upper triangle. Let me check if this matches the test input.\n\nBut in the test input, there are some elements in the lower triangle (i > j) that are non-zero. For example, in row4 (i=4), j=0 is 2, j=2 is 8, j=3 is 8. These are moved to (0,4), (2,4), (3,4). Similarly, row5 has j=0 (2), j=2 (6). So those are moved to (0,5), (2,5).\n\nSo the output matrix should have these elements in the upper triangle. Let's verify.\n\nYes, the constructed output seems to follow the pattern. But let's cross-check with the examples.\n\nIn example 1, the input had [6,0,5,0] in row2 (i=2). The output's row0 (j=0) had [5,0,6,6]. So the 6 from (2,0) is at (0,2), and (3,0) 6 is at (0,3). Similarly, in example2, row4 (i=4) had 2 at j=1 and j=3. So those 2s were moved to (1,4) and (3,4). But in the output for example2, the row1, column4 is 2 (from (4,1) which was 2 in input). Wait, in example2's input, row4 (i=4) has j=1=2. So in output, (1,4) is 2.\n\nSo the process is to take all elements below the diagonal (i > j) and transpose them to (j,i) positions. So in the test input's row5 (i=5), j=0 is 2, which would go to (0,5). j=2 is 6 \u2192 (2,5). j=3 is 0 \u2192 (3,5). j=4 is 0 \u2192 (4,5). So yes, in the output row0, j=5 is 2 (from i=5,j=0). row2, j=5 is 6 (from i=5,j=2). row3,j=5 is 0. row4,j=5 is 0.\n\nSo the output should be as constructed. Let me check if this matches the required format.\n\nYes, the format is to have each row as a list. So the final answer should be:\n\n[5, 0, 3, 0, 2, 2]\n[0, 5, 3, 0, 0, 0]\n[0, 0, 5, 0, 8, 6]\n[0, 0, 0, 5, 8, 0]\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0]\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5]",

        "cot_2": "Okay, let's look at these examples to figure out the pattern. So, each input is a matrix, and the output is some transformation of it. Let's start with Example 0.\n\nIn Example 0, the input matrix is:\n[5, 0, 0]\n[3, 5, 0]\n[0, 0, 5]\n\nThe output is:\n[5, 3, 0]\n[0, 5, 0]\n[0, 0, 5]\n\nHmm, looking at this, it seems like the first row of the output takes the first element of the input's first row (5), then the first element of the second row (3), and then the first element of the third row (0). Wait, no, the third element in the output's first row is 0, which is the same as the input's third element in the first row. Wait, maybe not. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's a transpose of some sort. Let's check. The original matrix is lower triangular, maybe? Because all the non-zero elements are on or below the main diagonal. The output in Example 0 seems to have the elements above the diagonal. Wait, but the output here looks like the transpose, but only for the elements below the diagonal. Let's check the positions.\n\nOriginal input for Example 0:\nRow 0: [5,0,0]\nRow 1: [3,5,0]\nRow 2: [0,0,5]\n\nOutput:\nRow 0: [5,3,0]\nRow 1: [0,5,0]\nRow 2: [0,0,5]\n\nSo comparing input and output, the first row of output is 5, 3, 0. The 3 here comes from the input's row 1, column 0. The original input's row 0 had 5 in column 0, row 1 had 3 in column 0 and 5 in column 1, etc. The output's row 0 is 5, then 3 (from row1, column0), then 0. The second row is 0,5,0. The third row remains the same.\n\nWait, maybe the output is taking the lower triangular part (excluding the diagonal) and transposing it to the upper part? Let's see. In the input, the lower triangular elements below the diagonal are 3 (row1, col0), and the rest are zeros. The output has that 3 in row0, col1, which is the transposed position. So perhaps the pattern is that the matrix is transposed but keeping the diagonal elements in place, and then merging the transposed lower elements into the upper part?\n\nWait, in the output of Example 0, the diagonal remains the same. The lower elements (below the diagonal) in the input are moved to the upper part. For example, the 3 in input's (1,0) is now in output's (0,1). So the lower elements (positions where row > column) are transposed to the upper positions (row < column), while the diagonal stays. But what about the other elements?\n\nLooking at Example 1:\n\nInput:\n[5, 0, 0, 0]\n[0, 5, 0, 0]\n[6, 0, 5, 0]\n[6, 0, 4, 5]\n\nOutput:\n[5, 0, 6, 6]\n[0, 5, 0, 0]\n[0, 0, 5, 4]\n[0, 0, 0, 5]\n\nSo here, the input's third row (index 3) and first column (0) is 6, which in the output appears in row 0, column 3? Wait, no. Let me check the positions. The input's third row (row index 3) has elements 6,0,4,5. The output's first row is 5,0,6,6. The 6 here is from the input's row 2, column 0 (6) and row3, column0 (6). But in the output's first row, the third element is 6 (from row2, col0?), and the fourth element is 6 (from row3, col0). Similarly, the output's third row (row 2) has 5,0,0,4. The 4 comes from input's row3, column2 (4). So in the output, that 4 is at row2, column3.\n\nSo maybe the process is: For each element below the diagonal (i.e., where row > column), we transpose them to the position (column, row). So for example, in Example 1, the input has a 6 at (2,0). Transposing it would put it at (0,2). And indeed, in the output's first row, the third element (index 2) is 6. Similarly, input's (3,0) is 6, which in output's (0,3) is 6. Also, input's (3,2) is 4, which in output's (2,3) is 4. \n\nBut wait, the diagonal elements (5s) stay the same, and the elements above the diagonal in the input (which are all zeros here) become zeros in the output. So the pattern seems to be that the lower triangular part (excluding the diagonal) is transposed to the upper triangular part, while keeping the diagonal the same. So the output is the original matrix with its lower triangular elements (excluding diagonal) moved to their transposed upper positions, and the original upper elements are replaced by the transposed lower elements. But if there are elements in the upper part in the input, do they get replaced?\n\nWait, in Example 2:\n\nInput:\n[5, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[0, 5, 0, 0, 0]\n[8, 8, 5, 0, 0]\n[0, 2, 0, 5, 0]\n[0, 2, 0, 1, 5]\n\nOutput:\n[5, 0, 8, 0, 0]\n[0, 5, 8, 2, 2]\n[0, 0, 5, 0, 0]\n[0, 0, 0, 5, 1]\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 5]\n\nLooking at this, the lower elements (row > column) in the input are being transposed to the upper part. For example, input[2][0] is 8, which becomes output[0][2]. Input[2][1] is 8, which becomes output[1][2]. Input[3][1] is 2, which becomes output[1][3]. Input[4][1] is 2, which becomes output[1][4]. Input[4][3] is 1, which becomes output[3][4]. So all elements below the diagonal (row > column) in the input are moved to their transposed positions (column, row) in the output. The elements above the diagonal in the input are set to zero, but wait, in the output, the upper elements (from the transposed lower ones) are there, but the original upper elements are overwritten. Wait, the original input's upper elements (like in Example 0, input's row0, column1 is 0, but after transposing the lower elements, output's row0, column1 is 3 in Example 0). So the process is that for each element in the lower triangle (excluding diagonal), we swap them to their upper positions, and the upper elements (originally in the input) are replaced by those transposed values. Wait, but in Example 0, the original upper elements are all zero, so the transposed elements take their place. But in Example 2, the input's upper elements (like row0, column2 is 0) become 8 in the output because the lower element (row2, column0) is 8. So this suggests that the output matrix is formed by taking the original matrix, keeping the diagonal the same, and for all positions where row < column (upper triangle), we take the value from the input's (column, row) position. Essentially, the output is the original matrix's transpose, but only for the lower triangle elements, and the upper triangle elements are the transpose of the lower ones, while the diagonal remains unchanged. So the output matrix is a combination of the original diagonal and the transposed lower elements in the upper triangle.\n\nSo the pattern is: For each element in the matrix, if the position is on the diagonal (row == column), it stays the same. For elements above the diagonal (row < column), the value is taken from the input's (column, row) position. For elements below the diagonal (row > column), the value in the output is zero. Wait, but looking at Example 0's output, the output has zeros in the lower triangle. For example, output row1, column0 is 0. Which in the input was 3 (row1, col0), but in the output, that position is 0. So maybe the output is a matrix where the upper triangle (excluding diagonal) is filled with the transposed lower triangle elements from the input, and the lower triangle (excluding diagonal) is set to zero. So the result is a matrix that is the diagonal plus the transposed lower triangle in the upper part.\n\nIn other words, the output is the input matrix with its lower triangular part (excluding diagonal) transposed to the upper triangular part, and the lower part set to zero.\n\nLet me test this with Example 0. The input's lower triangle (excluding diagonal) has element at (1,0) = 3. Transposing it to (0,1) in the output. The rest of the lower triangle is zero. So the output upper triangle has 3 at (0,1), and the lower triangle (row > column) is zero. So the output becomes:\n\nRow0: [5,3,0]\nRow1: [0,5,0]\nRow2: [0,0,5]\n\nWhich matches the example. Similarly, Example 1: The input's lower triangle has elements at (2,0)=6, (3,0)=6, (3,2)=4. Transposing these to (0,2)=6, (0,3)=6, (2,3)=4. So the upper triangle in the output has those values, and the lower parts are zero. So the output's first row is [5,0,6,6], second row [0,5,0,0], third [0,0,5,4], fourth [0,0,0,5]. Which matches the example.\n\nSimilarly, Example 2: The input's lower triangle elements (excluding diagonal) are (2,0)=8, (2,1)=8, (3,1)=2, (4,1)=2, (4,3)=1. Transposing these to (0,2)=8, (1,2)=8, (1,3)=2, (1,4)=2, (3,4)=1. So the output's upper triangle has those values. The output's first row is [5,0,8,0,0] (but wait, why isn't the 8 in (0,2)? Oh wait, in the output's first row, the elements are [5,0,8,0,0]. Let's check the positions. The input's (2,0) is 8, which becomes (0,2) in the output. So the third element (column 2) in row0 is 8. Yes. The input's (2,1) is 8, which becomes (1,2) in the output. So row1, column2 is 8. Then input's (3,1) is 2 \u2192 (1,3) in output. Input's (4,1) is 2 \u2192 (1,4) in output. Input's (4,3) is 1 \u2192 (3,4) in output. So the output's second row is [0,5,8,2,2]. Then the third row is [0,0,5,0,0], fourth [0,0,0,5,1], fifth [0,0,0,0,5]. Which matches the example.\n\nSo the transformation is:\n\nFor each element in the input matrix:\n\n- If the position is on the diagonal (row == column), leave it as is.\n\n- If the position is in the upper triangle (row < column), take the value from the input's (column, row) position.\n\n- If the position is in the lower triangle (row > column), set it to zero.\n\nSo the output is a combination of the diagonal and the transposed lower triangle in the upper part, with the lower part set to zero.\n\nNow, applying this to the test input:\n\nTest Input:\n[5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[3, 3, 5, 0, 0, 0]\n[0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0]\n[2, 0, 8, 8, 5, 0]\n[2, 0, 6, 0, 0, 5]\n\nSo this is a 6x6 matrix.\n\nWe need to transpose the lower triangle elements (excluding diagonal) to the upper triangle, and set lower triangle elements (excluding diagonal) to zero.\n\nLet's list the lower triangle elements (row > column):\n\nLooking at each element where row > column:\n\nRow 1, column 0: 0 \u2192 becomes (0,1) in output.\n\nRow 2, columns 0 and 1: 3 and 3 \u2192 become (0,2) and (1,2) in output.\n\nRow 3, columns 0,1,2: 0,0,0 \u2192 become (0,3), (1,3), (2,3) in output.\n\nRow 4, columns 0,1,2,3: 2,0,8,8 \u2192 become (0,4), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4) in output.\n\nRow 5, columns 0,1,2,3,4: 2,0,6,0,0 \u2192 become (0,5), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5) in output.\n\nSo the output's upper triangle will have these values transposed.\n\nSo let's construct the output matrix:\n\nThe diagonal elements are the same as input. So all [i][i] = 5, except maybe the last element. Let's check:\n\nRow0: [5, ... ]\n\nRow1: [0,5, ... ]\n\nRow2: [0,0,5, ... ]\n\nRow3: [0,0,0,5, ... ]\n\nRow4: [0,0,0,0,5, ... ]\n\nRow5: [0,0,0,0,0,5]\n\nNow, for each upper triangle position (row < column):\n\nFor (0,1): value from input (1,0) which is 0 \u2192 output[0][1] = 0.\n\n(0,2): input (2,0) is 3 \u2192 output[0][2] =3.\n\n(0,3): input (3,0) is 0 \u2192 0.\n\n(0,4): input (4,0) is 2 \u2192 output[0][4] =2.\n\n(0,5): input (5,0) is 2 \u2192 output[0][5] =2.\n\nThen (1,2): input (2,1) is3 \u2192 output[1][2]=3.\n\n(1,3): input (3,1) is0 \u21920.\n\n(1,4): input (4,1) is0 \u21920.\n\n(1,5): input (5,1) is0 \u21920.\n\n(2,3): input (3,2) is0 \u21920.\n\n(2,4): input (4,2) is8 \u21928.\n\n(2,5): input (5,2) is6 \u21926.\n\n(3,4): input (4,3) is8 \u21928.\n\n(3,5): input (5,3) is0 \u21920.\n\n(4,5): input (5,4) is0 \u21920.\n\nNow, let's build each row.\n\nRow0:\n\n[5, (0,1)=0, (0,2)=3, (0,3)=0, (0,4)=2, (0,5)=2]\n\nSo [5,0,3,0,2,2]\n\nRow1:\n\n[0 (since row1>col0), 5, (1,2)=3, (1,3)=0, (1,4)=0, (1,5)=0]\n\nSo [0,5,3,0,0,0]\n\nWait, wait. Wait, the output's row1 is the second row (index1). The positions for row1 are:\n\nColumns where column > row (row1, columns 2,3,4,5).\n\nSo:\n\n(1,2) is 3 (from input[2][1] =3)\n\n(1,3): input[3][1]=0 \u21920\n\n(1,4): input[4][1]=0 \u21920\n\n(1,5): input[5][1]=0 \u21920\n\nSo row1: [0,5,3,0,0,0]\n\nRow2:\n\nColumns where column >2 (columns3,4,5).\n\n(2,3): input[3][2]=0 \u21920\n\n(2,4): input[4][2]=8 \u21928\n\n(2,5): input[5][2]=6 \u21926\n\nSo row2: [0,0,5,0,8,6]\n\nWait, but the output matrix's lower triangle (row>column) must be zero. So row2's elements for columns0,1,2 are 0,0,5. Then columns3,4,5 are the transposed elements.\n\nRow3:\n\nColumns4 and5.\n\n(3,4): input[4][3] =8 \u21928\n\n(3,5): input[5][3] =0 \u21920\n\nSo row3: [0,0,0,5,8,0]\n\nRow4:\n\nOnly column5.\n\n(4,5): input[5][4]=0 \u21920\n\nSo row4: [0,0,0,0,5,0]\n\nRow5:\n\nNo columns after 5, so remains [0,0,0,0,0,5]\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nRow0: [5,0,3,0,2,2]\n\nRow1: [0,5,3,0,0,0]\n\nRow2: [0,0,5,0,8,6]\n\nRow3: [0,0,0,5,8,0]\n\nRow4: [0,0,0,0,5,0]\n\nRow5: [0,0,0,0,0,5]\n\nWait, but let's check if this matches the examples' patterns. For example, in the test input's row4 (index4), the elements are [2,0,8,8,5,0]. The lower elements (columns0-3) are 2,0,8,8. These would transpose to columns4's positions (0,4)=2, (1,4)=0, (2,4)=8, (3,4)=8.\n\nWait, in our previous calculation, for row0, column4: input[4][0] =2 \u2192 output[0][4] =2.\n\nRow3, column4: input[4][3] =8 \u2192 output[3][4] =8.\n\nSimilarly, input row5, column0:2 \u2192 output[0][5] =2.\n\nRow5, column2:6 \u2192 output[2][5]=6.\n\nSo putting all together, the output should be:\n\n[5, 0, 3, 0, 2, 2]\n[0, 5, 3, 0, 0, 0]\n[0, 0, 5, 0, 8, 6]\n[0, 0, 0, 5, 8, 0]\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0]\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5]\n\nBut wait, let me check if the test input's row3 is [0,0,0,5,0,0]. So in the input, row3 (index3) has 5 at column3. So in the output, row3, column4 comes from input's row4, column3, which is 8. So output row3, column4 is8. That matches.\n\nBut wait, in the output matrix, the lower triangle (row>column) should be zero. So for example, in row4, column0-3 are zero. Yes. The row5, column0-4 are zero. Correct.\n\nSo this should be the correct output."
