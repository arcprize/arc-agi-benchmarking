        "cot_1": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. So, looking at the training examples, the input is a list of lists, and the output is another list of lists but shorter. Let me compare the input and output for each example.\n\nStarting with Example 0. The input has four lists, each of length 8. The output has the same four lists, but each is shortened to length 4. Wait, but in the input, the original lists are [1,1,3,2,1,1,3,2], and the output is [1,1,3,2]. Oh, I see. The original list is being halved. Because 8 elements become 4. So maybe taking the first half of each list?\n\nLet me check the next input in Example 0. The second list is [1,1,3,3,1,1,3,3], which becomes [1,1,3,3]. Again, taking the first four elements. The same for the third and fourth lists. So yes, each list is cut in half, keeping the first half.\n\nExample 1: Input lists are [4,4,4,4,4,4] which becomes [4,4,4]. The original length is 6, so half is 3. Similarly, the next lists of length 6 become 3 elements each. So same pattern: take first half.\n\nExample 2: Input lists are [2,3], [3,2], etc., each of length 2. Output is the same as input. Because half of 2 is 1, but maybe when the length is even but the split would result in 1 element, but in the example, they kept the original. Wait, no. Wait, in Example 2, the input is 6 lists, each of length 2. The output is 3 lists, same as the original. Wait, no. Wait, the input is 6 lists, each of length 2, but the output is the same three lists. Wait, looking back:\n\nInput for Example 2 is:\n\n[2,3]\n\n[3,2]\n\n[4,4]\n\n[2,3]\n\n[3,2]\n\n[4,4]\n\nAnd the output is:\n\n[2,3]\n\n[3,2]\n\n[4,4]\n\nSo the input has six lists, output has three. Wait, but each list in the input is length 2. The output is the first three lists? But in the input, there are duplicates. The first three are [2,3], [3,2], [4,4], then they repeat. So the output is the first three unique lists. Or maybe the pattern is to remove duplicates that are consecutive duplicates. Wait, but the input lists are arranged in pairs. Like, [2,3] appears twice in the input. Similarly for others. So the output removes every other list. Or perhaps the input is a duplication of the same lists, and the output is the unique ones. Let me see. The input lists are arranged as two copies of the same three lists. So the output is just the first three, eliminating duplicates. But how does that fit with the previous examples?\n\nWait, in the first two examples, the pattern was to take each list and cut it in half. But in Example 2, each list is length 2. So cutting in half would take the first element. But the output lists are the same as the input lists. That doesn't fit. So maybe there's a different pattern here.\n\nWait, let's re-examine Example 2. Input has six lists, each of length 2. Output has three lists. So perhaps the output is every other list, taking the first occurrence. For example, in Example 2's input, the lists are arranged as [A, B, C, A, B, C], and the output is [A, B, C]. So it's removing the duplicates that are repeated consecutively. But how does that fit with the other examples?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that each list in the output is the first half of the input lists. But in Example 2, each input list is length 2. Taking the first half (1 element) would result in a single element, but the output lists are length 2. So that doesn't make sense. So that can't be the case.\n\nHmm, perhaps the pattern is different. Let's look at all examples again.\n\nIn Example 0:\n\nOriginal lists are of length 8. Output lists are of length 4. So each output list is the first half of the input list.\n\nIn Example 1:\n\nInput lists of length 6 become length 3. Again, first half.\n\nIn Example 2:\n\nInput lists are of length 2. Output lists are length 2. So perhaps when the length is even, and half is an integer, but the output is the same as input. Wait, but that's not the case in the first two examples. Wait, no. So maybe the pattern is that each list is divided into two halves, and duplicates are removed. Like, for each list, check if the second half is the same as the first half. If yes, then output the first half. If not, output the entire list? No, because in Example 0, the first list in input is [1,1,3,2,1,1,3,2]. The first half is [1,1,3,2], and the second half is [1,1,3,2], which is the same. So the output is the first half. Similarly, the second input list is [1,1,3,3,1,1,3,3]. The two halves are the same, so output first half. Third input list [3,3,1,1,3,3,1,1] \u2013 first half [3,3,1,1], second half same, so output first half. Fourth list [2,3,1,1,2,3,1,1], halves same. So output first half.\n\nBut in Example 1, the input lists are:\n\n[4,4,4,4,4,4] \u2192 first half [4,4,4], second half same. So output first half.\n\nSecond input list [6,4,8,6,4,8] \u2192 first half is [6,4,8], second half is same. So output first half.\n\nThird input list [6,6,8,6,6,8] \u2192 first half [6,6,8], second half same. Output first half.\n\nSo the pattern seems to be: for each list in the input, if the list can be split into two equal halves that are identical, then output the first half. Otherwise, maybe output the entire list?\n\nBut then Example 2. Input lists are [2,3], [3,2], [4,4], each appearing twice. So each input list's length is 2. Split into two halves of length 1. So for [2,3], the first half is [2], second half [3]. They are not the same, so the entire list is kept. But in Example 2's output, the lists are still [2,3], [3,2], [4,4], same as the input. Wait, but according to this logic, since the two halves are not the same, the entire list is kept. But in the input, the lists are duplicated. For example, the first list is [2,3], then later it appears again. The output has each list once. So perhaps the pattern is twofold: first, for each individual list, if the list is composed of two identical halves, output the first half. Then, among all the processed lists, remove duplicates, keeping the first occurrence.\n\nWait, but in Example 0, the output lists are the same as the input lists but each halved. But in that example, the output lists are all unique. The input lists are four, each of which when halved gives four unique lists. So the output is four lists.\n\nIn Example 1, the input has three lists, each when halved gives three unique lists. So the output is three.\n\nIn Example 2, each input list is split into halves. Since each list has length 2, the halves are of length 1. For example, [2,3] becomes [2] and [3], which are not equal. So the entire list is kept. Then, after processing each list, the output would have all six lists, but in the example's output, there are only three. So this suggests that in addition to the halving, the output is taking every other list, perhaps? Because in Example 2, the input is six lists, and the output is the first three. So maybe the pattern is: process each list by halving if possible (i.e., split into two equal parts, if the two parts are the same, keep the first half; else, keep the entire list). Then, from the resulting list of lists, remove duplicates, keeping the first occurrence.\n\nIn Example 2, after processing each list, each list remains as the original (since halves don't match). Then the output would be [2,3], [3,2], [4,4], [2,3], [3,2], [4,4], but the actual output is only the first three. So this suggests that the second part of the pattern is to remove duplicate consecutive lists. Wait, but the input lists in Example 2 are arranged as [A, B, C, A, B, C]. The output is [A, B, C], which are the first occurrence of each unique list, but in the order they first appear. So perhaps the entire process is: for each list in the input, split into two halves. If the two halves are the same, output the first half. Otherwise, output the entire list. Then, in the overall list of processed lists, remove duplicates such that only the first occurrence of each unique list is kept.\n\nBut in Example 0, after processing each list, the four lists in the output are all unique. So they remain. In Example 1, three processed lists, all unique. So they remain. In Example 2, after processing, each list is the same as the original (since they couldn't be halved into same parts). Then, the input lists after processing are [2,3], [3,2], [4,4], [2,3], [3,2], [4,4]. The output is [2,3], [3,2], [4,4], so duplicates are removed, but only consecutive duplicates? Or remove all duplicates, keeping first occurrence. If it's the latter, then even non-consecutive duplicates are removed. But in the Example 2's output, the order is preserved, and the duplicates are removed. So the pattern would be: process each list as per the halving rule, then deduplicate the list of processed lists by keeping only the first occurrence of each unique list.\n\nBut how does that fit with the examples?\n\nLet me check Example 0. The processed lists are:\n\n[1,1,3,2], [1,1,3,3], [3,3,1,1], [2,3,1,1]\n\nThese are all unique, so no duplicates. So the output is the same as processed lists.\n\nExample 1:\n\nProcessed lists are [4,4,4], [6,4,8], [6,6,8]. All unique. So output remains.\n\nExample 2:\n\nProcessed lists are the same as input lists, since they couldn't be halved. Then, the input lists after processing are [2,3], [3,2], [4,4], [2,3], [3,2], [4,4]. The output is [2,3], [3,2], [4,4], which are the first occurrences of each unique list. So deduplication is applied.\n\nSo the overall pattern is:\n\n1. For each individual list in the input, check if it can be split into two equal halves where the first half is identical to the second half. If so, replace the list with the first half. Otherwise, leave it as is.\n\n2. After processing all lists, deduplicate the resulting list by removing any subsequent duplicates, keeping only the first occurrence of each unique list.\n\nNow, applying this to the test input.\n\nTest Input:\n\n[5,4,5]\n\n[4,5,4]\n\n[6,6,4]\n\n[2,6,2]\n\n[5,4,5]\n\n[4,5,4]\n\n[6,6,4]\n\n[2,6,2]\n\nFirst, let's process each list.\n\nEach list is of length 3. Since 3 is odd, they can't be split into two equal halves. So the first step (halving) isn't possible, so each list remains as is.\n\nSo after processing each list, the processed lists are the same as the input.\n\nNow, step 2: deduplicate by keeping the first occurrence of each unique list.\n\nThe test input lists are:\n\n1. [5,4,5]\n\n2. [4,5,4]\n\n3. [6,6,4]\n\n4. [2,6,2]\n\n5. [5,4,5] (duplicate of 1)\n\n6. [4,5,4] (duplicate of 2)\n\n7. [6,6,4] (duplicate of 3)\n\n8. [2,6,2] (duplicate of 4)\n\nSo after deduplication, the output should be the first four unique lists, in order: [5,4,5], [4,5,4], [6,6,4], [2,6,2].\n\nBut looking at the examples, in Example 2, the input had six lists (all duplicates) and the output was three. So the pattern is to deduplicate by keeping the first occurrence of each unique list, regardless of their position. So in the test input, after processing, the lists are the same as the input. The duplicates are the ones at positions 5-8. So the output should be the first four lists.\n\nThus, the output would be:\n\n[5,4,5]\n\n[4,5,4]\n\n[6,6,4]\n\n[2,6,2]\n\nBut let me check the examples again to ensure. In Example 2, the input was six lists: A B C A B C. The output was A B C. So the deduplication is not just removing consecutive duplicates but all duplicates. Wait, no. Because in Example 2, the input lists are A, B, C, A, B, C. The output is A, B, C. So the deduplication is keeping the first occurrence of each unique list and removing any subsequent duplicates. So even if a duplicate comes later, it's removed.\n\nSo applying that to the test input, which has lists 1-4 as unique, and 5-8 as duplicates of 1-4. So the output is the first four, since those are the first occurrences. Hence, the output would be the first four lists.\n\nBut let's check the Test Input:\n\nTest Input:\n\n[5,4,5]\n\n[4,5,4]\n\n[6,6,4]\n\n[2,6,2]\n\n[5,4,5]\n\n[4,5,4]\n\n[6,6,4]\n\n[2,6,2]\n\nAfter processing (since all lists are length 3, no halving possible), so the processed lists are same as input.\n\nThen, deduplicate by keeping the first occurrence of each unique list. So:\n\nThe first occurrence of [5,4,5] is position 0. Any subsequent are removed.\n\nThe first occurrence of [4,5,4] is position 1. Any subsequent are removed.\n\nSimilarly for [6,6,4] (position 2) and [2,6,2] (position 3).\n\nThus, the output would be:\n\n[5,4,5]\n\n[4,5,4]\n\n[6,6,4]\n\n[2,6,2]\n\nEach appearing once, in the order of their first occurrence.\n\nSo the final output should be these four lists.",

        "cot_2": "Okay, let's see. I need to figure out the pattern here. Let's look at the training examples first.\n\nIn Example 0, the input has four lists, each with 8 elements. The output is the same four lists, but each has 4 elements. Wait, so it looks like they're halved. Like taking the first half of each list. For example, the first input list is [1,1,3,2,1,1,3,2], and the output is [1,1,3,2]. That's exactly the first four elements. So maybe the transformation is to take the first half of each list.\n\nExample 1: The input lists are of length 6. The outputs are of length 3. Again, taking the first half. The first input list [4,4,4,4,4,4] becomes [4,4,4]. Yep, same pattern.\n\nExample 2: Input lists have 2 elements each. Outputs are the same as the inputs. Because taking the first half of a 2-element list is the whole list. So that fits.\n\nSo the pattern seems to be that for each list in the input, we take the first half of the elements. If the list length is even, split exactly in half. If odd, maybe truncate towards the first part. Wait, in the test input, each list has 3 elements. So the first half would be 1.5 elements, but since we can't have half, maybe take the first element? Wait, but the test input lists are [5,4,5], which has 3 elements. Taking the first half (rounded down?) would be 1 element, but that doesn't fit with the examples. Wait, maybe when the length is even, take exactly half, and when odd, take (n+1)/2? Wait, let me check.\n\nWait in the training examples, all input lists have even lengths. Example 0: 8 elements, output 4. Example 1: 6 elements, output 3. Example 2: 2 elements, output 2. So for even lengths, split into half. But the test input lists have 3 elements each. How to handle that?\n\nHmm. Wait the test input is:\n\n[5,4,5]\n[4,5,4]\n[6,6,4]\n[2,6,2]\n[5,4,5]\n[4,5,4]\n[6,6,4]\n[2,6,2]\n\nEach list has 3 elements. So if the pattern is to take the first half, but when the list has an odd number of elements, how? Let's see. For a 3-element list, the first half would be the first 1.5 elements, but since we can't split elements, perhaps take the first element (1) or first two (ceil(3/2) = 2). Wait, let's think. For example, in Example 2, the input lists are of length 2, so half is 1, but they took the full list. Wait, no, the output is the same as input. So maybe when the list length is even, take the first half (exactly half), and when odd, take the first (n+1)/2 elements. Wait, for a list of 3 elements, (3+1)/2 is 2, so take first 2 elements. Let's test that.\n\nBut in the test input, each list is 3 elements. So applying that rule, each would become 2 elements. But the test input has 8 lists. The output should then be 8 lists each of length 2. But looking at the training examples, the outputs are the same number of lists as the input, just each list is half the length. So for the test input, each list of 3 elements would become 2 elements (since 3//2 is 1, but maybe rounded up to 2? Wait, maybe the pattern is to take the first half, rounded down. So for even lengths, half. For odd, (n-1)/2. For example, 3 elements: 1 element. But that doesn't fit the examples. Let me check.\n\nWait in example 0, the input lists have 8 elements, output 4. 8/2=4. Example 1: 6 elements, output 3. 6/2=3. Example 2: 2 elements, output 2. So 2/2=1? Wait no, the output in example 2 is the same as the input. Wait, that's confusing. Wait in example 2, the input is:\n\n[2,3]\n[3,2]\n[4,4]\n[2,3]\n[3,2]\n[4,4]\n\nThe output is the same lists but only the first three. Wait no, the output is:\n\n[2,3]\n[3,2]\n[4,4]\n\nWait, the input has six lists, and the output has three. So the pattern here might be different. Wait, this is example 2. So the input lists are each of length 2. The output is each list as-is, but the input had six lists and the output has three. So the number of lists is halved. Wait, in example 0, the input has four lists, output four (each halved in length). Example 1: three input lists, three output. Example 2: six input lists, three output. So this adds another layer. So maybe in example 2, the pattern is not just halving each list but also halving the number of lists by removing duplicates or taking every other list. Wait, looking at the input for example 2:\n\nINPUT:\n\n[2,3]\n[3,2]\n[4,4]\n[2,3]\n[3,2]\n[4,4]\n\nOUTPUT:\n\n[2,3]\n[3,2]\n[4,4]\n\nAh, so the output is the first three lists. Because the input is repeating the same three lists twice. So the output is the first occurrence of each. So maybe the pattern here is that if the entire list of lists is duplicated (i.e., the input lists are a repetition of a sequence), then the output is the first occurrence of each. So in example 0, the input lists are:\n\n[1,1,3,2,1,1,3,2]\n[1,1,3,3,1,1,3,3]\n[3,3,1,1,3,3,1,1]\n[2,3,1,1,2,3,1,1]\n\nAnd the output is the same four lists but each halved in length. So the pattern here is for each individual list, take the first half. So in all examples, the transformation is to take each list and truncate it to the first half. For example 2, each list is of length 2, so taking the first half (1 element) but the output lists are still of length 2. Wait, no. Wait example 2's output is the same as input lists. So in example 2, the input lists are length 2, so the first half is the entire list. So perhaps when the length is even, take the first half (length/2 elements). When the length is odd, take (length+1)/2 elements? But that's conflicting with example 2. Alternatively, maybe the pattern is that for each list in the input, the output is the first half (if even length) or the first ceil(n/2) elements. But example 2's lists are length 2, so half is 1, but the output is the same as input. So that doesn't fit. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let's look again.\n\nWait in example 2, the input lists are:\n\n[2,3]\n[3,2]\n[4,4]\n[2,3]\n[3,2]\n[4,4]\n\nThe output is:\n\n[2,3]\n[3,2]\n[4,4]\n\nSo the output is the first three lists. So the number of lists is halved. So perhaps the pattern is that when the input lists are repeated (like duplicated), the output is the unique set or the first occurrence. But then why in the other examples, the number of lists remains the same. For example, example 0 has four input lists and four output lists. So this suggests that the pattern isn't about the number of lists but each individual list.\n\nWait this is confusing. Let me try to re-examine all examples.\n\nExample 0:\n\nInput lists have 8 elements each. Output is the first four elements of each. So each list is halved.\n\nExample 1:\n\nInput lists have 6 elements each. Output is first three. So halved.\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput lists have 2 elements each. Output is same as input. Wait, but 2 elements. Halved would be 1 element. But the output lists are of length 2. So that doesn't fit. So maybe the pattern isn't simply taking the first half of each list.\n\nWait, maybe there's another pattern. Looking at example 2's input and output. The input has six lists, each of two elements, and the output has three lists, the same as the first three. So the input lists are duplicated. The output is the first three unique lists. So perhaps the pattern is that when the entire list of lists is duplicated (like two copies of the same sequence), then the output is the first occurrence. But then in example 0, the input lists aren't duplicated, so the output remains four lists. Similarly in example 1.\n\nHmm, this is conflicting. Let's think differently. Maybe the pattern is that the output is the first half of each list, but when the list is even-length, it's exact, and when odd, perhaps take floor(n/2) elements. But example 2's lists are 2 elements, floor(2/2)=1. But the output is the same as the input lists. So that's not possible. So maybe the pattern is different.\n\nWait, maybe the pattern is to remove duplicate elements in each list. Let's check example 0's first input list: [1,1,3,2,1,1,3,2]. The output is [1,1,3,2]. But the original list has duplicates. But the output is the first four elements. So removing duplicates doesn't fit. So that's not it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the pattern is to take the first occurrence of each element until a repeat is encountered. But in example 0's first list, [1,1,3,2,1,1,3,2], the first elements are 1,1,3,2. So there's repetition here, but the output is the first four. Maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the lists are arranged in pairs, and the output is the first of each pair. But example 0's input has four lists, and the output has four lists, so that's not the case. But example 2's input has six lists, output three. So perhaps for every pair of identical lists, keep one. Like in example 2, the input has three unique lists, each repeated twice. So the output is the three unique ones. But example 0's lists are unique. So maybe the pattern is to remove duplicate lists. But example 0's input lists are all different. So output is the same. Example 1's input lists are three, and output three, which are all unique. Example 2's input has duplicates, so the output removes them. But then the test input has eight lists. Let's see:\n\nTest input:\n\n[5,4,5]\n[4,5,4]\n[6,6,4]\n[2,6,2]\n[5,4,5]\n[4,5,4]\n[6,6,4]\n[2,6,2]\n\nSo the lists are duplicated. The first four are followed by the same four again. So the output should be the first four lists. But according to example 2, when lists are duplicated, the output is the first occurrence. So the output would be the first four lists. But also, each list in the test input has 3 elements. If the pattern is to take the first half of each list, which would be 1.5, so perhaps take 2 elements. Let me see.\n\nWait example 0 and 1's output lists are exactly the first half of each input list. For even-length lists, this works. Example 2's lists are length 2, so output is same as input. So maybe for lists of even length, take first half; for odd-length lists, take ceil(n/2) elements. For example, a 3-element list, ceil(3/2) = 2 elements. So for the test input lists, each has 3 elements, so take the first two. So the output for each list would be [5,4], [4,5], [6,6], [2,6], then repeat for the next four lists. But according to example 2's logic, if the lists are duplicated, then output the first occurrence. So the test input has eight lists, which are two copies of the same four lists. So the output would be the first four lists, each with first two elements. So combining both patterns: remove duplicate lists (take first occurrence) and take first half (rounded up for odd lengths). \n\nSo the test input's output would be:\n\n[5,4]\n[4,5]\n[6,6]\n[2,6]\n\nWait but the test input's lists are:\n\n[5,4,5] \u2192 first two elements are [5,4]\n[4,5,4] \u2192 [4,5]\n[6,6,4] \u2192 [6,6]\n[2,6,2] \u2192 [2,6]\nThen the next four lists are duplicates of the first four. So the output would be the first four lists, each truncated to two elements. But looking at the examples, in example 2, the output lists are the same as the input lists (no truncation), but the input lists are length 2. So in example 2, truncation wasn't needed. So perhaps the main pattern is to take the first half of each list (rounded up if needed) and then, if the entire list of lists is duplicated, output the first occurrence. But in the test case, we have eight lists, which are two copies of four lists. So the output would be the first four lists, each truncated to two elements.\n\nSo the final output for the test input would be:\n\n[5,4]\n[4,5]\n[6,6]\n[2,6]\n[5,4]\n[4,5]\n[6,6]\n[2,6]\n\nWait but example 2's output was only three lists, which were the first three of the six input lists. So perhaps in that case, the pattern is to take the first half of the total number of lists, each truncated to half length. So for example 2's input has six lists, output three. So for the test input with eight lists, output four? But in example 0, input four lists, output four. So that's not consistent.\n\nWait, this is getting complicated. Maybe the pattern is two-fold: for each individual list, take the first half of its elements (exact for even lengths, floor(n/2) for odd?), and then remove duplicate lists in the overall list of lists. But how does that apply to the examples?\n\nExample 0: all input lists are unique. Output is each list halved. So no removal.\n\nExample 1: all input lists are unique. Output is each list halved.\n\nExample 2: input has six lists, which are duplicates. Output is three unique lists, each same as input (since even length).\n\nTest input: eight lists, which are two copies of four lists. So applying the pattern: for each list, take the first half of elements. For lists of length 3, half is 1.5, so maybe take 1 element? Or 2? Because for example, if we take 2 elements, then each 3-element list becomes 2 elements. Then, remove duplicate lists. But in the test input, the first four lists are [5,4,5], [4,5,4], [6,6,4], [2,6,2], and then repeated. If each is truncated to two elements, they become [5,4], [4,5], [6,6], [2,6]. Then the next four would be the same. So removing duplicates would leave four lists. But the examples don't show removing duplicates unless the entire list is duplicated. So example 2's input is two copies of three lists. The output is three lists. So perhaps the pattern is to remove the duplicate lists, keeping only the first occurrence. And for each list, truncate to first half elements.\n\nSo combining both steps:\n\n1. For each individual list in the input, truncate it to its first half elements (if even length, exact half; if odd, maybe floor(n/2) or ceil(n/2)?)\n\n2. Then, remove duplicate lists from the entire list of lists, keeping only the first occurrence.\n\nSo in example 0, all lists are unique after truncation, so output remains four.\n\nIn example 1, all lists are unique after truncation, so output remains three.\n\nIn example 2, after truncation, each list is the same as before (since length 2, truncating to 1 element would be [2], [3], [4], etc. But the output is the same as the input lists, which is length 2. So this contradicts. Wait, example 2's input lists are length 2. If we take the first half, that's 1 element. But the output lists are still length 2. So that suggests that truncation isn't happening here, which contradicts the previous examples. So perhaps my initial assumption is wrong.\n\nWait, this is confusing. Let's try to find another pattern.\n\nLooking at example 0:\n\nInput lists have 8 elements each. Output is first 4 elements. So exactly half.\n\nExample 1: 6 elements \u2192 3. Exactly half.\n\nExample 2: 2 elements \u2192 2. So same as input.\n\nAh! Wait, maybe the pattern is to take the first half of each list, but when the list has an even length. But example 2's input lists have even length (2) \u2192 half is 1, but the output is still 2 elements. So that doesn't fit. Alternatively, maybe the pattern is that each list is split into two halves, and the first half is kept. But in example 2, each list is two elements, split into [2] and [3], but the output is [2,3]. So that doesn't fit. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is to remove the second half of each list. So for even lengths, exactly half. For odd lengths, maybe the middle element is included in the first half. Like for a list of 3 elements, the first two are kept. For example, [5,4,5] becomes [5,4].\n\nIf that's the case, then in example 2, since each list is two elements (even), the first half is one element. But the output is the full list. So that doesn't align. So perhaps the pattern is different.\n\nWait, another angle: looking at example 0's output lists. The input lists are of the form:\n\nOriginal list: [1,1,3,2,1,1,3,2]\n\nOutput: [1,1,3,2]\n\nSo the first four elements. Then, the second half is [1,1,3,2]. So the output is the first half. But the second half is the same as the first. So maybe the pattern is to take the first occurrence of each unique pattern in the list, but how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the pattern is that each list is a repetition of a shorter list. For example, in example 0's first input list, [1,1,3,2,1,1,3,2], it's the shorter list [1,1,3,2] repeated twice. So the output is the base list. Similarly, example 1's first input list [4,4,4,4,4,4] is [4,4,4] repeated twice. So output is [4,4,4].\n\nIn example 2's input lists, each is two elements, but the input is six lists which are three pairs. So each pair is the same. The output is the first of each pair. So the pattern is that each input list is a repetition of a base list. So the output is the base list, which is the first half.\n\nSo for example, in example 0, each input list is two copies of the base list. So the output is the base list. So the pattern is: take the first half of each list (assuming that the input list is the base list repeated twice). Then, deduplicate the lists if they are repeated in the overall list.\n\nSo the test input lists would be checked if each is a repetition of a base list. Let's see:\n\nTest input lists:\n\n[5,4,5]\n[4,5,4]\n[6,6,4]\n[2,6,2]\n[5,4,5]\n[4,5,4]\n[6,6,4]\n[2,6,2]\n\nEach of these lists has 3 elements. If they are not repetitions of a base list, then perhaps the output is the first half. But since the length is 3, the first half would be 1 element (floor(3/2) = 1) or 2 (ceil(3/2) = 2). For example, [5,4,5] would become [5,4] if taking two elements. But then, in example 2, when the list is length 2, which would be split into 1 element, but the output is the full list. So perhaps the pattern is that the input lists are formed by repeating a base list twice, and the output is the base list. So for example, a list of length 8 is a base list of 4 repeated twice. So output is the base list. For a list of length 6, it's a base list of 3 repeated twice. For a list of length 2, which can't be split into two equal parts (unless the base is 1 element). But in example 2, the input lists are length 2, but the output is the same as input. So that doesn't fit unless the base list is 2 elements. But then the output is the same as input, implying the input is the base list repeated once.\n\nWait, this is getting complicated. Let's try another approach. For each training example, how does the input relate to the output.\n\nExample 0:\n\nInput lists have length 8 \u2192 output length 4. So 8 / 2 =4.\n\nExample 1: 6 \u21923. 6/2=3.\n\nExample 2: 2 \u21922. 2/2=1, but output is 2. So this breaks the pattern.\n\nWait, but example 2's output is the same as the input lists, but the input lists are length 2. So maybe the pattern is to take the first half of each list when the length is even, but when the length is 2, leave it as is. But that's arbitrary.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is to remove duplicate consecutive lists. For example, in example 2, the input lists are duplicated, so the output removes the duplicates. But example 0's lists are not duplicated. So the output for example 0 is the same number of lists, each halved.\n\nSo the pattern might involve two steps:\n\n1. For each individual list, take the first half of its elements (if even length, exact half; if odd length, floor(n/2) or ceil(n/2)?).\n\n2. Remove any duplicate consecutive lists from the overall list.\n\nBut in example 2, after step 1, each list would be halved. Since the lists are length 2, that would be 1 element. But the output lists are length 2. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is simply to take the first half of each list's elements, regardless of even or odd length. But in example 2's case, that would mean each list becomes 1 element. But the output lists are length 2. So that doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. I'm stuck. Let's look for another pattern.\n\nIn example 0, the input lists are:\n\n[1,1,3,2,1,1,3,2]\n[1,1,3,3,1,1,3,3]\n[3,3,1,1,3,3,1,1]\n[2,3,1,1,2,3,1,1]\n\nOutput lists:\n\n[1,1,3,2]\n[1,1,3,3]\n[3,3,1,1]\n[2,3,1,1]\n\nEach output list is the first half of the input list. So for even-length lists, it's straightforward.\n\nExample 1's input lists are length 6 \u2192 output 3. So again, first half.\n\nExample 2's input lists are length 2 \u2192 output same as input. So for lists of length 2, they remain the same. But why? If we take the first half (1 element), output would be [2], [3], [4], etc. But the output lists are [2,3], etc. So this contradicts. Unless the pattern is that for even-length lists, take the first half. But for lists of length 2, the first half is 1 element, but in the example, they're kept as-is. So perhaps there's a mistake in my analysis.\n\nWait, example 2's input is:\n\n[2,3]\n[3,2]\n[4,4]\n[2,3]\n[3,2]\n[4,4]\n\nOutput is:\n\n[2,3]\n[3,2]\n[4,4]\n\nSo the output is the first three lists. So the number of lists is halved. And each list is kept as-is. So perhaps the pattern here is that if the input list of lists is duplicated, then the output is the first half of the lists, each kept as-is. So in example 2, six lists become three. So the output is the first three lists. And in example 0 and 1, the number of lists remains the same. So the pattern might be: if the input lists are duplicated (i.e., the same sequence of lists appears more than once), then the output is the first occurrence of each unique list. Otherwise, each list is halved in elements.\n\nBut this seems complicated. Let me check:\n\nExample 0: four lists, not duplicated. So each is halved.\n\nExample 1: three lists, not duplicated. Each is halved.\n\nExample 2: six lists (three unique, each appearing twice). Output is three unique lists.\n\nTest input: eight lists. The first four are unique, then repeated. So output would be the first four lists, each possibly halved in elements. But each test list has three elements, so how to halve? If we take the first two elements, each list becomes:\n\n[5,4]\n[4,5]\n[6,6]\n[2,6]\n[5,4]\n[4,5]\n[6,6]\n[2,6]\n\nThen, since the lists are duplicated, output is the first four.\n\nSo the final output would be:\n\n[5,4]\n[4,5]\n[6,6]\n[2,6]\n\nBut according to the training examples' format, each list in the output is enclosed in brackets and separated by lines.\n\nSo the test input's output would be:\n\n[5,4]\n[4,5]\n[6,6]\n[2,6]\n[5,4]\n[4,5]\n[6,6]\n[2,6]\n\nWait no, because if we remove duplicates, it's the first four lists. But in the test input, the first four are unique, then duplicated. So output would be the first four lists, each truncated to two elements. So the output would be four lists.\n\nBut looking back at example 2, the input had six lists (three unique, each appearing twice). Output is three lists, same as the unique ones. So in that case, the output is the unique lists, not duplicated. So perhaps the pattern is:\n\n- For each list, truncate to the first half of elements (exact for even, floor for odd).\n\n- Then, remove any duplicate consecutive lists in the overall list.\n\nBut example 0 and 1 don't have duplicate lists, so output is same number of lists. Example 2 has duplicates, so output is the first occurrence of each. \n\nTest input has eight lists, which are two copies of four lists. So after truncation, each list becomes two elements, and the output would be four lists.\n\nBut wait, in example 2, the truncation would have taken 1 element from each list (since length 2), but the output lists are length 2. So this contradicts.\n\nHmm. Maybe the pattern is that each list is simply truncated to half its length, rounded down. For even lengths: exact. For odd lengths: floor(n/2). Then, if the entire list of lists is duplicated, output only the first occurrence.\n\nBut example 2's lists are length 2 \u2192 floor(2/2) =1. So each list becomes 1 element. But the output lists are still length 2. So this doesn't fit.\n\nI'm really stuck. Let's try to see if there's a different pattern.\n\nAnother angle: in example 0, the output is the first four elements of each list. The first four elements of the first list are [1,1,3,2], and the next four are [1,1,3,2]. So the first half is the same as the second half. So perhaps the input lists are made by repeating a base list twice, and the output is the base list.\n\nSimilarly, example 1's first input list is [4,4,4,4,4,4], which is [4,4,4] repeated twice. Output is [4,4,4]. \n\nExample 2's input lists are [2,3], [3,2], [4,4], each repeated twice. Output is the base lists. \n\nSo the pattern is: the input lists are each a repetition of a base list twice. The output is the base list.\n\nIf this is the case, then for the test input:\n\nEach list is three elements. If they are a repetition of a base list, the base list would need to be 1.5 elements, which isn't possible. So perhaps the test input isn't a repetition, so this pattern doesn't apply. But in example 2, the lists are length 2, so base list is 1 element. For example, [2,3] is [2,3], which is not a repetition. Wait, but this contradicts.\n\nWait, example 0's input lists are length 8. If each is a base list of 4 elements repeated twice, then output is the base list. So yes.\n\nExample 1's input lists are length 6. Base list of 3 elements, repeated twice.\n\nExample 2's input lists are length 2. So base list of 1 element repeated twice? But [2,3] can't be split into two repetitions. So this pattern doesn't hold.\n\nSo this suggests that the pattern is to split each list into two equal parts and take the first part. So for even-length lists, it's possible. For odd lengths, maybe the first part is first floor(n/2) elements. \n\nBut example 2's lists are even length (2), so split into two parts of 1 each. So output should be first part of 1 element. But the output is the same as the input. So this doesn't fit. \n\nI think I'm missing something here. Let me look again at the examples.\n\nIn example 0, each output list is the first half of the input list.\n\nExample 1: same.\n\nExample 2: the output lists are the same as the input lists, but the number of lists is halved. Because the input lists are duplicated. So the pattern is two-fold:\n\n1. For each individual list, take the first half of elements (if even length).\n\n2. For the overall list of lists, remove any duplicates, keeping only the first occurrence.\n\nBut in example 2, the first step would take each list of length 2 to 1 element, but the output lists are length 2. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the pattern is just to take the first half of the entire list of lists. For example, in example 2, the input has six lists, output is first three. In example 0, input has four lists, output four. So that doesn't fit.\n\nWait, example 0 has four input lists and four output lists. So the number of lists remains the same. Example 1: three lists input, three output. Example 2: six input, three output. So the pattern for the number of lists is: if the input lists are duplicated (appear twice), output is the first occurrence. So for example 2, input is six lists (three unique, each twice), output is three. For the test input, eight lists (four unique, each twice), output is four. Each of these four lists would be the first half of the original lists. But each original list is three elements. So first half of three elements is two elements. \n\nSo for the test input:\n\nOriginal lists:\n\n[5,4,5] \u2192 first two elements [5,4]\n\n[4,5,4] \u2192 [4,5]\n\n[6,6,4] \u2192 [6,6]\n\n[2,6,2] \u2192 [2,6]\n\nThen the output would be these four lists, each truncated to two elements. And since the input lists are duplicated, the output is the first four (unique) lists.\n\nSo the final output would be:\n\n[5,4]\n[4,5]\n[6,6]\n[2,6]\n\nBut looking at the training examples' output format, they have the same number of lists as the input if there are no duplicates, and half if there are duplicates. So for the test input, since it's two copies of four lists, the output would be four lists, each truncated to two elements.\n\nThus, the answer should be:\n\n[5,4,5] \u2192 first two elements: [5,4]\n\n[4,5,4] \u2192 [4,5]\n\n[6,6,4] \u2192 [6,6]\n\n[2,6,2] \u2192 [2,6]\n\nBut wait, the test input has eight lists. The first four are the same as the next four. So the output would be the first four lists truncated to two elements each. But according to example 2's pattern, when lists are duplicated, output the first occurrence. So the output would be four lists. Each of the first four lists in the input are unique (but repeated), so the output is the first four lists, each truncated.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n[5,4]\n[4,5]\n[6,6]\n[2,6]"
