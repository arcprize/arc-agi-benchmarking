        "cot_1": "Okay, let's see. I need to figure out the pattern from the training examples and apply it to the test input. Let me start by looking at the examples closely.\n\nIn Example 0, the input has numbers like 2 and 4. The output replaces all the 2s with 4s, and the 4 at the bottom becomes 0. Similarly, in Example 1, all the 3s become 6s, and the 6 at the bottom becomes 0. So maybe the rule is to double the number (since 2\u21924, 3\u21926) except for the bottom row's number, which gets set to 0. Wait, in Example 0's input, the bottom row has a 4, and in the output, it's 0. But in the input, that 4 wasn't part of the other 2s. So maybe the pattern is: for all the numbers except the bottom-left element, double them. Then set the bottom-left element (which was 4 in example 0 and 6 in example 1) to 0.\n\nLooking at the test input: the bottom-left element is 2. So according to the pattern, that 2 should become 0. Then all the 8s in the other rows should be doubled to 16. Wait, but in the examples, the outputs don't have 16. Wait, wait\u2014hold on. Let me check the examples again. Oh, right. In example 0, the input has 2s which are turned into 4s (doubled), and the 4 becomes 0. In example 1, 3s become 6s (doubled) and the 6 becomes 0. So the pattern is: take all instances of the number in the bottom-left cell (except itself) and double them, then set the bottom-left cell to 0.\n\nWait, that makes sense. Because in example 0, the bottom-left is 4. But the input's 2s are turned into 4s. Wait, no\u2014the input's 2s are in the array, and the output's 4s. So the number in the bottom-left of the input is 4 in example 0, but the other numbers are 2. So 2 is half of 4. Then, in example 1, the bottom-left input is 6, and the other numbers are 3. So again, 3 is half of 6. So the pattern is: the bottom-left number in the input is the target value. All other cells that have half of that target value are replaced by the target, and the bottom-left cell is set to 0.\n\nWait, example 0: input has 2s and a 4 in the bottom. Output: 2s become 4s, and the 4 becomes 0. Example 1: 3s become 6s (since bottom is 6), then the 6 becomes 0. So the rule is: find the value in the bottom-left cell. Then, replace all instances of (that value / 2) with that value. Then set the bottom-left cell to 0.\n\nSo for the test input: the bottom-left cell is 2. So (2 / 2) is 1. Wait, but in the test input, the numbers are 8s. That doesn't fit. Wait, this can't be right. Let me check again.\n\nWait, in the first example, input bottom-left is 4. The other numbers are 2. 2 is half of 4, so they are replaced by 4. Then in the second example, bottom-left is 6, and the other numbers are 3 (half of 6). So in test input, the bottom-left is 2. So the numbers to replace would be 1 (since 2/2=1). But the test input's other numbers are 8. So that doesn't fit. So maybe my initial hypothesis is wrong.\n\nWait, maybe the pattern is that the number in the bottom-left is the double of the number being replaced. So in example 0: 4 is the double of 2. So replace all 2s with 4. Then set the bottom 4 to 0. Example 1: 6 is double of 3. So replace 3s with 6s. Then set the 6 to 0. So in test input, the bottom-left is 2, which would mean replacing all 1s with 2s. But the test input has 8s. That doesn't make sense. So this approach is not working.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the bottom-left number is the sum of all the other numbers. But example 0: how many 2s? Let's count. First input:\n\nRow 0: all zeros.\n\nRow1: 2,2,2 \u2192 3 twos.\n\nRow2: 0,2,0 \u2192 1 two.\n\nRow3: 2,2,2,2 \u21924 twos.\n\nRow4: 2,2,2 \u21923 twos.\n\nRow5: 0,2 \u21921 two.\n\nTotal 3+1+4+3+1=12. But the bottom-left is 4. 12 is not 4. So that's not it.\n\nAnother idea: maybe the output is the input with all non-zero numbers (except the bottom-left) doubled, and the bottom-left is set to 0. Let's check:\n\nIn example 0's input, the non-zero numbers (excluding the 4 at the bottom) are all 2s. So doubling them gives 4s, which matches the output. Then the 4 is set to 0. Correct.\n\nIn example 1, the non-zero numbers (excluding the 6 at the bottom) are 3s. Doubling them gives 6s. The 6 becomes 0. Correct.\n\nSo the pattern is: for all cells except the bottom-left cell, if the value is non-zero, double it. Then set the bottom-left cell to 0. Because in both examples, that's exactly what's happening.\n\nTesting this with the test input. The test input's non-zero cells (except the bottom-left 2) are 8s. So doubling them would make 16. But wait, looking at the outputs of the examples, they have 4, 6, etc., but the test input's 8s would become 16. However, in the examples, the output numbers are exactly the double of the input numbers (except the bottom-left). But in the test input, the numbers to be doubled are 8, which would become 16. However, the output examples from the training data don't have such numbers. But maybe that's the correct pattern regardless.\n\nSo applying this pattern to the test input:\n\nOriginal input:\n\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0]\n[0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0]\n[0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0]\n[0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0]\n[0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0]\n[2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nDoubling all non-zero except the bottom-left 2:\n\nEach 8 becomes 16. Then set the bottom-left (2) to 0.\n\nSo the output would be all the 8s turned into 16s, and the 2 at the bottom becomes 0.\n\nBut wait, the training examples had the bottom number being 4 and 6, which in the input were 4 and 6 (since they were the doubled values), but in the output they were set to 0. Wait, in example 0's input, the bottom-left is 4. Then in the output, it's set to 0. So in the test input, the bottom-left is 2. So according to the pattern, we should set that to 0, regardless of what it is. Then double all other non-zero numbers.\n\nSo the test input's 8s would become 16s. So the output should be:\n\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[0, 16, 16, 16, 0, 0, 0]\n[0, 16, 16, 16, 16, 16, 0]\n[0, 0, 0, 16, 16, 0, 0]\n[0, 0, 16, 16, 0, 0, 0]\n[0, 0, 16, 16, 16, 0, 0]\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nBut wait, the training examples didn't have numbers higher than 6. But maybe that's the correct pattern. However, looking back at the examples, in the outputs, the doubled numbers are exactly the bottom-left number of the input. For example, in example 0, the bottom-left input is 4, and all the 2s (4/2) are replaced by 4. Similarly, in example 1, the bottom-left is 6, and all 3s (6/2) are replaced by 6. So the actual pattern is that the bottom-left number is the value that replaces all the (original value = bottom-left / 2) entries. Then set the bottom-left to 0.\n\nIn that case, for test input, the bottom-left is 2. So the value to replace is 2 / 2 = 1. So all cells with 1 would be replaced by 2, but the test input's non-zero cells are 8s, not 1s. So according to this pattern, nothing would be replaced, except setting the bottom-left to 0. But that's not what the output in the examples show. So this approach is conflicting.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let's re-examine the examples.\n\nExample 0:\n\nInput has 2s in various places and a 4 at the bottom. The output replaces all 2s with 4s and the 4 becomes 0. So the 4 is the replacement value, and the 2s are the original. So 4 is double the 2. The 4 in the input is the replacement value, and the original is 2. So the replacement is 2 * 2 =4.\n\nExample 1:\n\nInput has 3s and a 6 at the bottom. Output replaces 3s with 6s, and the 6 becomes 0. So again, the replacement value is double the original (3*2=6). So the replacement value is taken from the bottom-left cell. So in the input, the bottom-left cell is the replacement value. All other cells with the original value (replacement_value / 2) are replaced with the replacement value, and the bottom-left cell becomes 0.\n\nSo in example 0: replacement value is 4 (from the bottom-left). So all 2s (4/2=2) become 4s, and bottom-left becomes 0.\n\nExample1: replacement value is 6. All 3s (6/2=3) become 6s. Bottom-left becomes 0.\n\nSo for the test input: the bottom-left is 2. So replacement value is 2. Then, we need to find all cells with value 1 (2/2=1) and replace them with 2. But the test input's cells are 8s. So there are no 1s to replace. Therefore, all 8s would remain, and the bottom-left 2 becomes 0. But this would result in the same input except the bottom-left is 0. But that doesn't match the training examples. Wait, but in the test input, the cells are 8s. So according to this pattern, since the replacement value is 2, and the original would be 1, but there are no 1s. So the output is the same as input except the bottom-left is 0. But that's not possible. Then why the test input's output would look like the 8s are replaced by 16s? Because maybe the pattern is that the replacement value is the bottom-left cell's value, and all cells with that value divided by 2 are replaced. So in the test input, the bottom-left is 2. So replace all 1s (2/2=1) with 2. But since there are no 1s, nothing changes except the bottom-left becomes 0. But the test input's output would then have the same 8s, but the examples show that when the replacement value is present, the other numbers are replaced. So this is conflicting.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the replacement value is the double of the bottom-left cell. Wait, in example 0: bottom-left is 4. Replaced 2s (which is 4/2) with 4. So the replacement value is 4, which is the same as the bottom-left. So the replacement value is the bottom-left cell's value. So in example 0, replacement value is 4 (same as bottom-left), and replace all 4/2=2s with 4. In example1, replacement is 6 (same as bottom-left), replace all 6/2=3s with 6. So in test input, replacement value is 2 (bottom-left). Then replace all 2/2=1s with 2. But there are no 1s. So the output would have all 8s as is, except the bottom-left is 0. But that's not consistent with the examples. The test input's output would be the same as the input except the 2 becomes 0, which is not what the examples do. But in the examples, they have numbers that are half of the replacement value. So if the test input's 8s are not related to the replacement value (since 8 is not 1), then they would stay. But that seems unlikely.\n\nWait, this suggests that the pattern is not applicable here. But maybe the test input has a different scenario. Maybe the 8s are to be replaced with 16, but the bottom-left is 2. Then the replacement value is 2, so 2/2=1. So nothing. Hmm. This is confusing.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the replacement value is not the bottom-left cell, but the number in the bottom-left cell is part of the input that's being replaced. Let me look again at the examples.\n\nIn example0 input:\n\nThe bottom-left cell is 4. All other non-zero cells are 2. So in the output, 2s become 4s (the same as the bottom-left cell's value) and the 4 becomes 0.\n\nSimilarly, in example1 input, the bottom-left cell is 6. All other non-zero cells are 3, which becomes 6, and the 6 becomes 0.\n\nSo the pattern is: the bottom-left cell's value is the replacement value. All other cells with value equal to (replacement value / 2) are replaced with the replacement value, then the bottom-left cell is set to 0.\n\nTherefore, in the test input, the bottom-left cell is 2. So replacement value is 2. So replace all cells with value 1 (2/2=1) with 2. But the input has 8s. So there are no 1s. Therefore, the output would be the same as the input, but the bottom-left cell is 0. But that's not possible because the test input's other cells are 8s, which would remain. However, in the examples, when there are values that match replacement_value/2, they are replaced. But if there's no such value, nothing changes except the bottom-left.\n\nBut in the test input, this would mean:\n\nOriginal input:\n\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0]\n[0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0]\n[0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0]\n[0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0]\n[0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0]\n[2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nOutput would be:\n\nAll 8s remain, and the bottom-left 2 becomes 0. But according to the examples, when there's a replacement value (like 4,6), the other numbers are replaced. So perhaps the test case is expecting to double all the non-zero numbers except the bottom-left, regardless of their value. Then set the bottom-left to 0.\n\nWait, but in the examples, the numbers to be replaced were exactly half of the bottom-left's value. But if the pattern is to double all non-zero numbers except the bottom-left, regardless of their relation to the bottom-left, then in the test input, the 8s would become 16s and the 2 becomes 0.\n\nBut why did the training examples have the bottom-left as the doubled value? Because in example0's input, the 4 is the doubled value of 2. But if the rule is to double all non-zero except the bottom-left, then in example0, the 2s become 4, and the 4 (which is in the bottom-left) is set to 0. So it works. Similarly, example1: 3s become 6s, and the 6 in the bottom is set to 0. So the pattern is: double all non-zero cells except the bottom-left, then set the bottom-left to 0.\n\nIf that's the case, then the test input's 8s become 16s, and the 2 becomes 0. So the output would have 16s wherever there were 8s, and 0 in the bottom-left.\n\nBut the problem is that in the examples, the bottom-left in the input is already the doubled value. For example, example0's input has 4 in the bottom-left, which is the doubled value of 2. So in the input, the bottom-left is the target value (the doubled one), and in the output, it becomes 0. So perhaps the pattern is that in the input, the bottom-left holds the target value (which is double of the other numbers). So when processing, all instances of (target value / 2) are replaced with target value, and the bottom-left is set to 0.\n\nSo for the test input, the bottom-left is 2, which would mean replacing all 1s (since 2/2=1) with 2. But there are no 1s in the test input. So the output would be the same as the input except the bottom-left is 0. But in the test input, the other numbers are 8s, which are not 1. So they remain 8s. But this seems unlikely given the examples.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is different. Let's think of the bottom-left number as the \"key\" that indicates what to replace. So in example0, the key is 4. All 2s (which is 4/2) are replaced with 4. Then key becomes 0. In example1, key is 6. All 3s (6/2) are replaced with 6, then key becomes 0. So in the test input, key is 2. So replace all 1s (2/2=1) with 2, then set key to 0. But test input has 8s, so no replacements. Output is the same as input except key is 0.\n\nBut in that case, the test input's output would have 8s and a 0 at the bottom. But the examples show that all instances of half the key are replaced by the key. But in the test case, there are no such instances. So the output is the same as the input except the bottom-left is 0.\n\nBut that seems to contradict the initial examples. Because in example0, the key is 4, and all 2s are replaced by 4. Similarly, example1's key is 6, replace 3s with 6. So the key in the input is the target replacement value, and the numbers to replace are those that are half of the key.\n\nSo the pattern is:\n\n1. Identify the key (bottom-left value in the input).\n\n2. Replace all instances of (key / 2) in the input with the key.\n\n3. Set the bottom-left cell to 0.\n\nIn the test input, the key is 2. So key/2 is 1. There are no 1s in the input. So step 2 does nothing. Step 3: set bottom-left to 0. So the output is the same as the input except the bottom-left is 0.\n\nBut in that case, the output would have 8s. However, in the training examples, all the replaced numbers (2,3) were replaced with the key (4,6), which are their doubles. But in the test input, the 8s are not part of the replacement because they are not 1. So the output would be:\n\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[0,8,8,8,0,0,0]\n[0,8,8,8,8,8,0]\n[0,0,0,8,8,0,0]\n[0,0,8,8,0,0,0]\n[0,0,8,8,8,0,0]\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nBut that doesn't match the structure of the training outputs, which replaced the numbers. However, the training outputs only had cases where the numbers to be replaced were present. If there are no numbers to replace, the output just changes the key to 0.\n\nBut the problem states that the answer should follow the same pattern as the training examples. But in this case, if there's no number to replace, the answer would be the same as input with key set to 0. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe I've misunderstood the pattern.\n\nAnother approach: looking for other patterns. For instance, maybe the output shifts the numbers up. But the examples don't show that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the numbers are rotated or mirrored. Let's look at example0's input and output.\n\nInput example0:\n\nThe input has a structure with 2s forming some pattern, and a 4 at the bottom. The output replaces the 2s with 4s and sets the bottom to 0. Similarly for example1. So the key is the bottom-left, and the replacement is key replacing all (key/2) numbers.\n\nSo the conclusion is that the test input's output should have all 1s replaced with 2 (key is 2), but since there are no 1s, only the bottom-left is set to 0. So the output is:\n\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[0,8,8,8,0,0,0]\n[0,8,8,8,8,8,0]\n[0,0,0,8,8,0,0]\n[0,0,8,8,0,0,0]\n[0,0,8,8,8,0,0]\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nBut according to the problem statement, the output examples replaced all non-zero numbers (excluding the bottom-left) with the key. But in the training examples, the key was double those numbers. So perhaps the pattern is to replace all non-zero numbers (except the key) with twice their value, then set the key to 0.\n\nWait, in example0: input has 2s and 4. Output has 4s (which is 2*2) and the 4 becomes 0. So yes. Example1: 3s become 6 (3*2), and the 6 becomes 0. So the pattern is: double all non-zero numbers except the bottom-left, then set the bottom-left to 0.\n\nAh! This makes sense. So for every non-zero cell except the bottom-left, double its value. Then set the bottom-left to 0.\n\nApplying this to the test input:\n\nEvery 8 (non-zero, not the bottom-left) becomes 16. The bottom-left 2 becomes 0. So the output would be:\n\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[0, 16, 16, 16, 0, 0, 0]\n[0, 16, 16, 16, 16, 16, 0]\n[0, 0, 0, 16, 16, 0, 0]\n[0, 0, 16, 16, 0, 0, 0]\n[0, 0, 16, 16, 16, 0, 0]\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nBut the training examples didn't have numbers larger than 6. But maybe that's just how the examples are. The pattern would still hold.\n\nBut why in the training examples, the bottom-left's input was already the doubled value? Because in example0, the input's 2s are doubled to 4, and the bottom-left was 4 (which is then set to 0). So in the input, the bottom-left cell is the doubled value of the other non-zero cells. But this might not be the case for all possible inputs. The pattern is to double all non-zero cells except the bottom-left, regardless of their value.\n\nSo for the test input, doubling the 8s to 16s is the correct approach. Even if they are not related to the bottom-left value. The bottom-left is just set to 0.\n\nThis seems to fit the examples. So the answer should be that.",

        "cot_2": "Okay, let's see. I need to figure out the pattern that transforms the input grids into the output grids based on the training examples. Let me start by carefully looking at the examples provided.\n\nIn Example 0, the input has numbers like 2s and a 4 at the bottom. The output replaces all 2s with 4s and the 4 at the bottom becomes 0. Similarly, in Example 1, all the 3s are replaced by 6s, and the 6 at the bottom becomes 0. So maybe the pattern is that each number in the grid (except the bottom one) is doubled, and the bottom number is set to 0.\n\nWait, let me check. For Example 0: The input has 2s and a 4 at the bottom. The output has 4s where there were 2s and 0 at the bottom. So 2*2=4, and the 4 becomes 0. Then in Example 1, 3s become 6s (3*2=6), and the 6 in the input becomes 0. So the rule seems to be: multiply all numbers except the one in the bottom-left corner (which is the only non-zero in the last row of input) by 2, and then set that bottom-left number to 0.\n\nLooking at the test input, there's an 8 in the bottom-left corner. Following the pattern, all the 8s except the bottom-left one should be doubled (to 16?), but wait, wait. Wait, in the training examples, the numbers in the grid (other than the bottom-left) were being doubled. Let me check again.\n\nWait, in Example 0's input, the numbers are 2s and a 4. The output replaces 2s with 4s (2*2), and the 4 becomes 0. So the multiplier is 2, but only if the number is not the one in the last row's first position. Wait, but in Example 0's input, the last row starts with 4, and in the output it becomes 0. Similarly, in Example 1, the last row starts with 6, which becomes 0. So the rule is: for all cells except the first cell of the last row, multiply the number by 2. The first cell of the last row is set to 0.\n\nSo in the test input, the last row starts with 2. So according to the pattern, all other numbers (which are 8s) should be multiplied by 2, becoming 16, and the 2 in the last row's first position becomes 0. But wait, in the training examples, the bottom number was 4 and 6, which were divided by 2 (4 becomes 0? No, 4 to 0. Wait, maybe the bottom number is actually the multiplier. Because in Example 0, 4 is in the input's bottom-left, and the output uses 4s (2*2=4). Wait, maybe the multiplier is the bottom-left number divided by 2. Wait, 4/2=2, which is the number being replaced. In Example 1, the bottom-left is 6, which divided by 2 is 3, which is the number being replaced. Oh! So the pattern is: the bottom-left number in the input indicates the value to be replaced. All occurrences of (bottom-left number divided by 2) in the input grid are replaced by the bottom-left number, and then the bottom-left number is set to 0. Because in Example 0, the bottom-left is 4, so 4/2=2. All 2s become 4, and then the bottom-left becomes 0. In Example 1, bottom-left is 6, so 6/2=3. All 3s become 6, and then bottom-left is 0. That makes sense.\n\nSo applying this to the test input: the bottom-left number is 2. So 2 divided by 2 is 1. So all 1s in the grid would be replaced by 2, but wait, the test input has 8s. Wait, that doesn't fit. Wait, maybe I got the multiplier the other way around. Wait, in the first example, the input has 2s and the bottom is 4. So 4 is the target replacement. So the rule is: find the value in the bottom-left cell (call it X). Then, replace all instances of X/2 with X, and set the bottom-left to 0.\n\nIn Example 0: X is 4. So replace all 2s (4/2=2) with 4. Then set X to 0.\n\nIn Example 1: X is 6. Replace all 3s (6/2=3) with 6, set X to 0.\n\nIn the test input, the bottom-left is 2. So X is 2. Then replace all 1s (2/2=1) with 2, and set the bottom-left to 0. But looking at the test input, there are 8s in the grid. So unless there's a mistake in the pattern, maybe the pattern is different.\n\nWait, maybe I misunderstood. Let me re-examine the examples.\n\nIn Example 0's input, the bottom-left is 4, and the rest of the grid has 2s. So 4 is the new value replacing the old value (2). Then in output, all 2s are 4s, and the 4 becomes 0.\n\nSimilarly, Example 1's input has a 6 in the bottom, and 3s in the grid. So 6 replaces 3s, then 6 becomes 0.\n\nSo the pattern is: the bottom-left number is the new value to replace the old value (which is half of it). Then, set the bottom-left to 0.\n\nTherefore, for the test input:\n\nThe bottom-left is 2. So the old value is 1 (2/2=1). So all 1s in the grid should be replaced with 2, and the bottom-left 2 becomes 0. However, the test input's grid has 8s, not 1s. So this seems conflicting. Unless there's a different pattern.\n\nWait, maybe the multiplier is not based on the bottom-left number. Let's look again.\n\nWait, in Example 0, the input has 2s and the output replaces them with 4s. The bottom-left number is 4. So 2*2=4, which matches the bottom-left. Then bottom-left becomes 0.\n\nIn Example 1, input has 3s, output has 6s. Bottom-left is 6. So 3*2=6. Then bottom-left becomes 0.\n\nAh, I see! So the rule is: multiply all instances of (X) in the grid by 2, where X is the value in the bottom-left cell divided by 2. Then, set the bottom-left cell to 0.\n\nWait, in Example 0, bottom-left is 4. 4 divided by 2 is 2. So all 2s are multiplied by 2 (becoming 4), and then the bottom-left 4 is set to 0.\n\nIn Example 1, bottom-left is 6. 6/2=3. So all 3s are multiplied by 2 (to 6), and the bottom-left 6 becomes 0.\n\nSo for the test input, the bottom-left is 2. So 2/2=1. So all 1s would be multiplied by 2, becoming 2. But in the test input, the numbers are 8s. Wait, that doesn't fit. Unless the test input has numbers that are multiples of the X value. Wait, maybe the test input's X is 2, so X/2=1, but there are no 1s. So maybe the output would have all 8s replaced with 16s? But that doesn't fit the previous pattern. Hmm, this is confusing.\n\nWait, maybe the actual rule is that all numbers except the bottom-left are multiplied by 2, and the bottom-left is set to 0. Let's check:\n\nIn Example 0, input numbers are 0, 2, 0, 2, etc. Multiply by 2: 0,4,0,4, etc. Bottom-left 4 becomes 0. That matches the output.\n\nExample 1: input numbers 0,3, etc. Multiply by 2: 0,6, etc. Bottom-left 6 becomes 0. So that's correct.\n\nSo the pattern is: all non-zero numbers except the bottom-left are multiplied by 2. Then, the bottom-left is set to 0.\n\nWait, but in Example 0's input, the bottom-left is 4. So according to that rule, multiply all other non-zero numbers (the 2s) by 2, getting 4s. Then set the bottom-left 4 to 0. Which matches the output.\n\nIn Example 1, the bottom-left is 6. Multiply all other non-zero (3s) by 2 to get 6s. Then set bottom-left to 0. Correct.\n\nIn the test input, the bottom-left is 2. So all other non-zero numbers (8s) should be multiplied by 2, becoming 16. Then set the bottom-left to 0.\n\nBut wait, in the training examples, the numbers to be replaced were exactly half of the bottom-left value. Because in Example 0, bottom-left is 4, and the numbers being replaced were 2 (4/2=2). Similarly, in Example 1, bottom-left is 6, and the numbers being replaced are 3 (6/2=3). So the rule seems to be that all numbers equal to half the bottom-left value are replaced by the bottom-left value, then the bottom-left is set to 0.\n\nBut in the test input, the bottom-left is 2, so half of that is 1. So all 1s would become 2, but the test input has 8s. So this would result in no changes except the bottom-left being 0, which doesn't match the training examples. That can't be right.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule is that all numbers in the grid except the bottom-left are doubled, then the bottom-left is set to 0. Let's test that.\n\nIn Example 0: The input has 2s. Multiply by 2 to get 4s. The bottom-left 4 becomes 0. Correct.\n\nExample 1: 3s multiplied by 2 become 6s. Bottom-left 6 becomes 0. Correct.\n\nTest input: 8s are multiplied by 2 to become 16s. The bottom-left 2 becomes 0. So the output would have 16s where there were 8s, and the bottom-left becomes 0. But the training examples didn't have numbers that weren't half the bottom-left. For example, if in the input there were numbers that are not half the bottom-left, would they be doubled?\n\nBut the training examples don't cover that scenario. So perhaps the pattern is simply: double every number except the bottom-left cell, then set the bottom-left to 0. That would fit the examples. Let's check:\n\nTest input: \n\nOriginal input has 8s. Doubling them gives 16s. The bottom-left 2 becomes 0. So the output would have 16s in all the positions where there were 8s, and the bottom-left is 0. But the problem is that in the training examples, the outputs replaced the numbers with the bottom-left value. For example, in Example 0, the 2s became 4s (the original bottom-left), and the 4 became 0. So it's more like the bottom-left's value is the new value for the old numbers (which were half of it). Then the bottom-left is zeroed.\n\nBut this only works if the numbers to replace are exactly half of the bottom-left. But the test input has 8s, and the bottom-left is 2, so 8 is not half of 2. So this would mean that the test input doesn't follow the same pattern. But that can't be, since the problem states that the same pattern applies.\n\nWait, perhaps the test input is a typo. Or maybe I'm missing something else.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is: the bottom-left number is the sum of all the numbers in the grid (excluding itself), and then all instances of that sum are replaced with double the sum, and then the bottom-left is set to zero. But that seems unlikely. Let me check.\n\nIn Example 0's input, sum of all numbers except the bottom-left 4: \n\nLooking at the input:\n\nRow 0: 0s \u2192 0.\n\nRow 1: 2+2+2=6.\n\nRow 2: 2 \u2192 2.\n\nRow 3: 2+2+2+2=8.\n\nRow 4: 2+2+2=6.\n\nRow 5: 2 \u2192 2.\n\nRow 6: 4 (but excluded).\n\nTotal sum: 6+2+8+6+2 = 24. Then, 24 would be the sum. But 24 is not related to the 4 in the output. Hmm, this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that the bottom-left number is the number of cells that are non-zero (excluding itself) multiplied by something. Not sure.\n\nWait, maybe the key is that in both training examples, the bottom-left number is exactly twice the value that is being replaced. For example, in Example 0, 4 is twice 2. In Example 1, 6 is twice 3. So for each example, the number in the bottom-left is double the number that appears in the grid (except itself). Then, the transformation is replacing those numbers (the ones that are half of the bottom-left) with the bottom-left's value and then zeroing the bottom-left.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Find the value in the bottom-left cell (X).\n\n2. Find all cells in the grid (excluding the bottom-left) that have the value X/2.\n\n3. Replace those cells with X.\n\n4. Set the bottom-left cell to 0.\n\nIf this is the pattern, then in the test input:\n\nBottom-left is 2. So X=2. Then X/2=1. So all cells with value 1 should be replaced with 2. But the test input has 8s. So according to this pattern, there would be no changes except setting the bottom-left to 0. But the test input's output would have all 8s remaining and the bottom-left becomes 0. However, this doesn't align with the training examples where the numbers were being replaced. So this suggests that the test input may have a different pattern.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the bottom-left number is the multiplier, and all numbers except itself are multiplied by that. Then the bottom-left is set to zero. Let's check:\n\nIn Example 0, X is 4. Multiply all numbers (except X) by 4. But the numbers are 0, 2, etc. So 2*4=8, which doesn't match the output. So this can't be right.\n\nHmm, this is getting confusing. Let me think differently. Looking at the input and output for Example 0:\n\nInput's bottom-left is 4. The output has all 2s replaced by 4, and the bottom-left is 0. Similarly, Example 1's input has 6 in the bottom-left, and 3s replaced by 6.\n\nSo the pattern is that the bottom-left number is the replacement value for all occurrences of half that number in the grid. Then, the bottom-left is set to 0.\n\nTherefore, in the test input:\n\nBottom-left is 2. So replacement value is 2. The number to replace is 1 (2/2=1). But the input has 8s. Since there are no 1s, the output would be the same as the input except the bottom-left becomes 0. But that's not possible because the test input's output should follow the pattern.\n\nBut wait, perhaps there's a mistake in the test input. Or perhaps I misunderstood the pattern. Alternatively, maybe the pattern is that all numbers except the bottom-left are doubled, regardless of their value, and the bottom-left is set to 0.\n\nIn Example 0: All 2s become 4, the bottom 4 becomes 0.\n\nExample 1: All 3s become 6, bottom 6 becomes 0.\n\nTest input: All 8s become 16, bottom 2 becomes 0.\n\nBut the training outputs show that the numbers are doubled, and the bottom is zeroed. If that's the case, then the test input's output would have all 8s replaced by 16s and the bottom-left 2 becomes 0. But in the training examples, the outputs have the doubled numbers, which matched the bottom-left's original value. For example, in Example 0, the bottom was 4, and the 2s became 4. So 2*2=4. Similarly, in Example 1, 3*2=6. So in the test input, 8*2=16. But the bottom-left is 2, which is not 16. So this doesn't fit. Therefore, the initial pattern is that the numbers being doubled are exactly half the bottom-left value, which is then set to zero.\n\nBut this doesn't fit the test input, unless the test input is a different case. Alternatively, maybe the bottom-left is the value to replace, and the numbers being replaced are half of it, but then in the test input, the numbers to replace would be 1 (half of 2), but there are no 1s. So the output would be the same as the input, except the bottom-left is 0.\n\nBut looking at the training examples, the inputs had numbers that were exactly half of the bottom-left value. So if the test input's numbers (8s) are not related to the bottom-left (2), then perhaps the pattern is different.\n\nWait, maybe the bottom-left number is the maximum value in the grid. In Example 0, 4 is the maximum. So all instances of the maximum/2 (2) are replaced with the maximum (4), then the maximum (now in the grid) is set to 0. Example 1: max is 6. All 3s (6/2=3) become 6, then set 6 to 0. In test input: the bottom-left is 2, but the maximum value in the grid is 8. So this breaks the pattern. So perhaps this isn't the case.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the bottom-left is a special value that when you replace all instances of its half and then zero it.\n\nBut the test input's 8s are not half of the bottom-left's 2, which is 1. So there's a disconnect here. So perhaps the pattern is different.\n\nWait, another possibility: the bottom-left cell's value is the number of times the replacement occurs. But this seems less likely.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's a rotation or some other grid transformation. For example, flipping the grid and replacing certain cells. Let's look at the structure.\n\nLooking at Example 0's input and output:\n\nInput has a 4 at the bottom. The output has that position as 0. The output's non-zero numbers are 4s in the same positions where there were 2s. So it's a direct replacement of 2s to 4s. Similarly for Example 1.\n\nTest input has 8s and a 2 at the bottom. Following the same pattern, replace 8s with 16s and set the bottom to 0. But according to the previous examples, the replacement number is the bottom-left value. So in the test input, the replacement would be 2, so all 8s would become 2? That doesn't make sense. But the previous examples show that the replacement number is the bottom-left's value, which is double the original numbers. But in the test input, the numbers to replace are 8s, which would have to be replaced by 2, which is not double. So this contradicts.\n\nThis suggests that my initial assumption is wrong. Maybe there's another pattern.\n\nWait, maybe the bottom-left number is the number of layers or steps in the transformation. Or perhaps it's the sum of some part of the grid. Let's try summing the non-zero numbers in Example 0's input:\n\nSum of non-zero numbers (excluding bottom-left):\n\nRow 1: 2+2+2=6.\n\nRow 2: 2=2.\n\nRow 3: 2+2+2+2=8.\n\nRow 4: 2+2+2=6.\n\nRow 5: 2=2.\n\nTotal sum: 6+2+8+6+2 = 24. The bottom-left is 4. 24/4=6. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the sum of non-zero cells (excluding bottom-left) is 24, which is 4*6. But I don't see a connection.\n\nAlternatively, the sum of all the numbers to be replaced (the 2s) in Example 0 is (3 in row 1) +1 in row 2 +4 in row3 +3 in row4 +1 in row5 \u2192 total 12. 12*2=24, which is the sum after replacement. But the bottom-left is 4. Not sure.\n\nHmm, I'm stuck. Let me try to find another approach.\n\nLooking at the positions of the non-zero numbers:\n\nIn Example 0's input, the non-zero numbers form a kind of diamond shape. The output preserves the same shape but with doubled values. Similarly for Example 1.\n\nThe test input's non-zero numbers might form a different shape, but the pattern of doubling and then zeroing the bottom-left would still apply.\n\nIf the pattern is simply to double all numbers except the bottom-left and then zero the bottom-left, then the test input's output would have 16s and a 0.\n\nBut the training examples have the bottom-left as the doubled value. For instance, in Example 0, the bottom-left is 4, and all the 2s become 4. So it's like the bottom-left's value is the target value for the doubled numbers. So in the test input, the bottom-left is 2, so all numbers to be doubled (which are 8s) would become 16s, but the bottom-left is 2, which would become 0. But this doesn't match the previous examples where the bottom-left's value was the target for the doubled numbers. So this suggests that the test input's 8s are not related to the bottom-left's 2.\n\nThis inconsistency makes me think that perhaps the correct pattern is: replace all occurrences of X with 2X, where X is the value in the bottom-left cell divided by 2. Then set the bottom-left to 0.\n\nSo for the test input:\n\nBottom-left is 2 \u2192 X=2/2=1. So replace all 1s with 2s. But the test input has 8s, so nothing changes except the bottom-left becomes 0. But that's not possible, as the output would be the same as the input except for the bottom-left. But in the training examples, the bottom-left's value was X*2. So if in the test input, X=1, replace all 1s with 2. But there are no 1s. So the output is the same as the input but with the bottom-left as 0.\n\nBut the training examples show that the output has the same structure but with the numbers replaced. However, the test input's output would look like:\n\n[0,0,...], [0,8,8,8,0...], etc., but the bottom-left becomes 0. But according to the training examples, that's possible only if there are no numbers to replace. But this doesn't fit the examples where there were numbers to replace.\n\nThis suggests that the test input might have a mistake, but since this is a puzzle, there must be a correct pattern.\n\nWait, maybe the bottom-left cell is part of a pyramid structure. Looking at the inputs:\n\nIn Example 0's input, the 2s form a diamond shape, and the bottom-left is 4. The output has 4s in the same positions. Similarly, in Example 1, 3s become 6s.\n\nSo the pattern is: the bottom-left cell's value is the new value for the old numbers in the pyramid structure, and then the bottom-left is zeroed.\n\nBut how to determine which numbers are part of the pyramid.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the bottom-left cell indicates the level of the pyramid. For example, in Example 0, the 4 might represent the height or layers. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's a cellular automaton or some other transformation. \n\nAnother approach: check the positions where the non-zero numbers appear. Let's see:\n\nIn Example 0's input:\n\nRow 1: columns 1-3 have 2s.\n\nRow 2: column 2 has 2.\n\nRow 3: columns 1-4 have 2s.\n\nRow 4: columns 2-4 have 2s.\n\nRow 5: column 3 has 2.\n\nRow 6: column 0 has 4.\n\nOutput has the same positions but with 4s, and row 6's 4 becomes 0.\n\nIn Example 1's input:\n\nRow 1: column 3 has 3.\n\nRow 2: columns 2-4 have 3s.\n\nRow 3: columns 1-4 have 3s.\n\nRow 4: columns 0-2 have 3s.\n\nRow 5: columns 2-3 have 3s.\n\nRow 6: column 0 has 6.\n\nOutput has 6s in those positions and row 6's 6 becomes 0.\n\nSo the positions of the non-zero numbers remain the same; only their values are changed. The value change is doubling them, and the bottom-left is set to zero.\n\nBut how to explain the test input.\n\nTest input:\n\nRows:\n\nRow 0: all 0s.\n\nRow 1: 8s at columns 1-3.\n\nRow 2: 8s at columns 1-5.\n\nRow 3: 8s at columns 3-4.\n\nRow 4: 8s at columns 2-3.\n\nRow 5: 8s at columns 2-4.\n\nRow 6: 2 at column 0.\n\nFollowing the pattern of the training examples, all non-zero numbers (8s) are doubled to 16s, and the bottom-left 2 becomes 0.\n\nBut the training examples replaced the numbers with the bottom-left's original value. For instance, in Example 0, the 2s became 4 (the original bottom-left value). But if the test input's 8s are to be replaced with 2 (original bottom-left), that would make no sense. So this suggests that the pattern is not to replace with the bottom-left's value, but to double the numbers and set the bottom-left to zero.\n\nBut in the training examples, the bottom-left's value was exactly double the original numbers. So doubling the original numbers gives the bottom-left's value. Then the bottom-left is set to zero.\n\nSo in the test input, the bottom-left is 2. The other numbers are 8. But 8*2=16, which is not related to the bottom-left's value. So this breaks the pattern. This is confusing.\n\nBut perhaps the correct answer is to follow the pattern: double all numbers except the bottom-left, then set the bottom-left to 0. Even if in the test case this leads to different numbers. \n\nSo applying that to the test input:\n\nEach 8 becomes 16, and the bottom-left 2 becomes 0.\n\nSo the output would be:\n\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n[0, 16, 16, 16, 0, 0, 0]\n\n[0, 16, 16, 16, 16, 16, 0]\n\n[0, 0, 0, 16, 16, 0, 0]\n\n[0, 0, 16, 16, 0, 0, 0]\n\n[0, 0, 16, 16, 16, 0, 0]\n\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nBut in the training examples, the output numbers are exactly the bottom-left's original value. For Example 0, all 2s become 4 (the bottom-left's value), and the bottom-left becomes 0. Similarly for Example 1. So the pattern is that the numbers being replaced are exactly half the bottom-left's value, and are replaced by the bottom-left's value, then the bottom-left is set to 0.\n\nIn the test input, the bottom-left is 2. So the numbers to replace would be 1 (2/2=1). But there are no 1s, so the output would be the same as the input, except the bottom-left is 0. But the input has 8s, so the output would have 8s and a 0. But this doesn't match the training examples.\n\nThis suggests that the test input's grid has a different structure. But this can't be, as the problem states that the same pattern applies.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the bottom-left number is the sum of all the numbers in the grid (excluding itself), and then all numbers are replaced by that sum. But this doesn't fit the training examples.\n\nIn Example 0's input:\n\nSum of non-bottom-left numbers:\n\nRows 0-5 and row 6's other cells:\n\nRow 0: 0s.\n\nRow1: 2+2+2=6.\n\nRow2: 2.\n\nRow3: 2+2+2+2=8.\n\nRow4: 2+2+2=6.\n\nRow5: 2.\n\nRow6: other cells are 0.\n\nTotal sum: 6+2+8+6+2=24. Bottom-left is 4. 24 is not 4.\n\nExample 1:\n\nSum of non-bottom-left numbers:\n\nRow1:3.\n\nRow2:3+3+3=9.\n\nRow3:3+3+3+3=12.\n\nRow4:3+3=6.\n\nRow5:3+3=6.\n\nSum:3+9+12+6+6=36. Bottom-left is 6. 36=6*6.\n\nHmm, interesting. 36 is 6 squared. But I'm not sure if that's relevant.\n\nIf that's the case, then for the test input:\n\nSum of non-bottom-left numbers:\n\nRow1:8+8+8=24.\n\nRow2:8+8+8+8+8=40.\n\nRow3:8+8=16.\n\nRow4:8+8=16.\n\nRow5:8+8+8=24.\n\nSum:24+40+16+16+24= 24+40=64, +16=80, +16=96, +24=120.\n\nBottom-left is 2. 120 is 60 times 2. Not sure.\n\nThis line of thought isn't leading me anywhere.\n\nLet me try to recap the pattern from the examples:\n\n- In each example, the output is generated by replacing all instances of a certain number (X) with twice that number (2X) and setting the bottom-left cell (which was 2X) to 0.\n\nIn Example 0: X=2 \u2192 replaced with 4, which was the bottom-left. Then 4 becomes 0.\n\nIn Example 1: X=3 \u2192 replaced with 6, which was the bottom-left. Then 6 becomes 0.\n\nSo the pattern is: the bottom-left cell's value is twice the number to replace. Replace all instances of that number with the bottom-left's value, then set the bottom-left to 0.\n\nIn the test input, the bottom-left is 2. So X is 1 (2/2=1). Replace all 1s with 2 and set the bottom-left to 0. But the input has 8s, so no replacements. So the output would have the same 8s and a 0 in the bottom-left.\n\nBut the test input's output would look like:\n\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n[0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0]\n\n[0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0]\n\n[0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0]\n\n[0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0]\n\n[0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0]\n\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nBut this doesn't align with the training examples where the numbers were replaced. However, this would be the case if there are no instances of X (1) in the test input.\n\nBut the problem statement says that the same pattern applies. So perhaps the test input is designed to have no numbers to replace, but the bottom-left is set to 0.\n\nBut this seems unlikely. There must be a different pattern.\n\nWait, maybe the pattern is to replace all numbers except the bottom-left with their double, and then set the bottom-left to 0. This would explain the training examples and the test input.\n\nIn Example 0:\n\nAll 2s become 4s, and the bottom-left 4 becomes 0.\n\nIn Example 1:\n\nAll 3s become 6s, and the bottom-left 6 becomes 0.\n\nIn the test input:\n\nAll 8s become 16s, and the bottom-left 2 becomes 0.\n\nSo the output would have 16s where there were 8s, and 0 at the bottom-left.\n\nBut this contradicts the training examples' pattern where the replacement was exactly the bottom-left's value. However, it's possible that the pattern is simply doubling all numbers except the bottom-left and zeroing it.\n\nIf that's the case, then the test input's output would be as described with 16s. But why in the training examples the doubled numbers match the bottom-left's original value.\n\nBecause in the training examples, the bottom-left's original value was twice the value being replaced. For example, in Example 0, bottom-left is 4, and the numbers being doubled are 2. So 2*2=4. So the replacement value matches the bottom-left. Then, when the bottom-left is zeroed, the output's replacements are the same as the bottom-left's original value.\n\nBut in the test input, the numbers being doubled are 8s, and the bottom-left is 2. 8*2=16, which is not related to the bottom-left's value. So this suggests that the pattern is not based on the bottom-left's value but simply doubling all numbers except the bottom-left.\n\nBut the training examples could have been designed such that the bottom-left's value is the doubled value of the numbers. So the test input would require a different approach. However, without more examples, it's hard to say. But given the training examples, the pattern seems to be that the bottom-left's value is twice the numbers being replaced. Hence, the test input's numbers (8s) would have to be replaced with 16s, which is 8*2, but then the bottom-left is 2, which is unrelated. This is conflicting.\n\nBut since the training examples show that the bottom-left's value is the replacement value for the numbers being doubled, perhaps in the test input, despite the bottom-left being 2, the numbers to be doubled are 8s. But this would break the pattern observed in the training examples.\n\nThis is really confusing. I think I'll have to make a best guess based on the training examples.\n\nThe key observation from the training examples is that the bottom-left number in the input is twice the number that is replaced in the grid. So all instances of (bottom-left / 2) are replaced with the bottom-left's value, and then the bottom-left is set to 0.\n\nApplying this to the test input:\n\nBottom-left is 2. So replace all instances of 1 (2/2=1) with 2. Since there are no 1s in the input, the output would have the same numbers except the bottom-left becomes 0. But in the test input, all non-zero numbers are 8s, which are not 1. So the output would be:\n\nSame as input, but the last row starts with 0.\n\nBut looking at the test input's structure, this seems possible. However, the training examples had the same structure with numbers replaced. But perhaps the test input is a case where no numbers need to be replaced except the bottom-left.\n\nBut this would mean the answer is the same as the input except the bottom-left is 0. Let's see:\n\nTest input:\n\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\n[0,8,8,8,0,0,0]\n\n[0,8,8,8,8,8,0]\n\n[0,0,0,8,8,0,0]\n\n[0,0,8,8,0,0,0]\n\n[0,0,8,8,8,0,0]\n\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nBut this doesn't follow the training examples' pattern where all numbers were replaced. So this must not be correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the pattern is different. Let's think outside the box. Maybe the bottom-left number indicates how many layers to shift or something else. \n\nAnother approach: look at the bottom-left number and see how it's positioned. In Example 0, it's at row 6, column 0. In Example 1, same. Test input also has it there. \n\nPerhaps the bottom-left number is irrelevant to the replacement and is just set to zero, and the rest of the numbers are doubled. That would fit the training examples and the test input.\n\nExample 0: 2s become 4s, bottom 4 becomes 0.\n\nExample 1: 3s become 6s, bottom 6 becomes 0.\n\nTest input: 8s become 16s, bottom 2 becomes 0.\n\nBut the problem is that in the training examples, the bottom-left's original value is the same as the doubled numbers. But in the test input, the doubled numbers (16) are not related to the bottom-left's 2. However, the pattern of doubling all numbers except the bottom-left and setting it to zero holds.\n\nGiven that the problem says to respond in the format of the training output examples, which involved replacing numbers with the bottom-left's value, this suggests that perhaps the test input is a mistake. But that's unlikely. So perhaps the correct answer is to double all numbers except the bottom-left and set it to zero.\n\nThus, the test input's output would be:\n\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n[0, 16, 16, 16, 0, 0, 0]\n\n[0, 16, 16, 16, 16, 16, 0]\n\n[0, 0, 0, 16, 16, 0, 0]\n\n[0, 0, 16, 16, 0, 0, 0]\n\n[0, 0, 16, 16, 16, 0, 0]\n\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nBut this doesn't follow the training examples' pattern of the bottom-left's value being the replacement. But given the instructions, this might be the answer.\n\nHowever, based on the training examples, the replacement value is the bottom-left's value. So in Example 0, the 2s become 4 (the bottom-left's value), and in Example 1, 3s become 6. Therefore, the pattern is that the replacement value is the bottom-left's value, and the numbers to replace are half of it. So for the test input, the replacement value is 2, and numbers to replace are 1. Since there are no 1s, only the bottom-left changes to 0.\n\nThus, the output would be the same as the input but with the last row's first element as 0. But according to the examples, this would be the case.\n\nBut this seems unlikely because the test input's 8s would remain, and the pattern of replacing numbers is not applied. However, given the training examples, this is the only consistent pattern.\n\nBut this would mean that the test input's output is the same as the input except the bottom-left is zero. Let's write that out.\n\nTest input's output would be:\n\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n[0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0]\n\n[0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0]\n\n[0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0]\n\n[0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0]\n\n[0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0]\n\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nBut this doesn't fit with the training examples, where the non-zero numbers were replaced. So this suggests that my initial conclusion is incorrect.\n\nAnother possibility: perhaps the bottom-left number is the value to replace, and all instances of it are replaced with its double, then the bottom-left is set to zero. But in Example 0, the bottom-left is 4, and there are no 4s except the bottom-left. So nothing changes except setting it to 0. But this isn't the case. So this can't be.\n\nI'm running out of ideas. Given the time I've spent, I think the correct pattern is that all non-zero numbers except the bottom-left are doubled, and the bottom-left is set to zero. Therefore, in the test input, all 8s become 16s and the bottom-left becomes 0."
