        "cot_1": "Okay, let's see. I need to figure out the pattern here. The input is a list of four arrays, each with seven numbers, and the output is another list of four arrays, each with three numbers. The outputs are all 0s and 3s. Hmm.\n\nLooking at the training examples. Let's start with Example 0. The input arrays are:\n\n[7,7,0,1,5,0,0]\n[7,0,0,1,5,0,0]\n[0,0,0,1,5,0,5]\n[0,0,0,1,5,5,0]\n\nThe outputs are:\n\n[0,0,3]\n[0,3,3]\n[0,3,0]\n[0,0,3]\n\nWait, each input array has seven elements, and each output array has three. So maybe each output element corresponds to some transformation of the input array. Let's see. Let's take the first input array in Example 0: [7,7,0,1,5,0,0]. The output is [0,0,3]. How could the input array lead to that?\n\nLooking for a possible pattern. Maybe the output is based on the positions of certain numbers in the input. The numbers present are 7,0,1,5. 1 is in the fourth position in all input arrays. Maybe the position of 1 is a fixed point. Let's check other examples. In Example 1, all input arrays have 1 in the fourth position. So maybe the fourth element is fixed as 1, which might not be part of the transformation.\n\nAnother thought: The output arrays have three elements. Maybe each output element corresponds to a pair of elements in the input array. Like, for each of the three positions in the output, check some condition in the input array. For example, the first output element could be related to the first two elements of the input array, the second to the next two, and so on. But since the input has seven elements, maybe the output is grouped into three parts, each part corresponding to a different section of the input.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each output digit is 3 if a certain condition is met in the input array, otherwise 0. Let's check.\n\nTake the first input of Example 0: [7,7,0,1,5,0,0]. Output is [0,0,3]. Let's see the third position in the output is 3. Maybe the third output element corresponds to the last part of the input array. For example, maybe the fifth, sixth, seventh elements. Let's see: 5,0,0. But why would that result in 3? Alternatively, maybe the presence of certain numbers. For instance, if there's a 5 followed by zeros, then 3? Or maybe the sum or count of certain numbers.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output elements are determined by the positions of 0s and non-zeros. For example, looking for runs of zeros. Let's see. The first input array in Example 0 has [7,7,0, ...]. The first two elements are 7s. The output starts with 0. Then the next part maybe the third and fourth elements: 0 and 1. Hmm, but how does that lead to 0 in the second output? Not sure.\n\nWait, the output arrays for Example 0 are four elements. Each input is a row, each output is a row. So maybe each output row corresponds to the input row. So for each input array, generate an output array of three elements. Let's look at each input array and their corresponding output.\n\nTake the first input in Example 0: [7,7,0,1,5,0,0]. Output is [0,0,3]. Let's break down the input array into parts. Maybe the three parts are positions 0-1, 2-3-4, 5-6? That would be three parts. Let's check:\n\nPart 1: 7,7. Both are non-zero. So maybe 0 here if they are same? Part 2: 0,1,5. Hmm. Part 3: 0,0. Both zeros. Maybe 3 here. So output [0,0,3]. But why 3?\n\nAlternatively, maybe each part checks for the presence of a 5 or 7. Let's see. The third part in the first input is 0,0. No 5 or 7, but output is 3. Hmm, not sure.\n\nAnother approach: Let's look for the differences between input arrays that lead to different outputs. Let's compare the first two input rows in Example 0:\n\nFirst input row: [7,7,0,1,5,0,0] \u2192 output [0,0,3]\nSecond input row: [7,0,0,1,5,0,0] \u2192 output [0,3,3]\n\nWhat's the difference between these two inputs? The second element: first has 7, second has 0. The output changes from 0,0,3 to 0,3,3. The second output element becomes 3 here. So perhaps the change in the second element of the input affects the second output element. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe each output element is determined by a certain rule. For example, the first output element is 3 if the first two elements are both 0, the second output element is 3 if the next three elements have a certain pattern, etc. Let's try this.\n\nLooking at the first input of Example 0 again: [7,7,0,1,5,0,0]. The output is [0,0,3]. Let's see:\n\n- Output element 0: 0. Maybe if the first two elements are both non-zero and same? Since 7 and 7 are same, the output is 0. But in the second input row, first two elements are 7 and 0, different. The output's first element is 0. Wait, maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the first output element is 0 unless certain conditions. Let's check other examples. Take Example 1's first input: [7,7,0,1,5,0,0]. Output is [0,0,3]. So same as Example 0. So maybe the first two elements being 7,7 gives 0. What about another example where the first two elements are different?\n\nLooking at Example 2's first input: [0,7,7,1,5,0,0] \u2192 output [0,0,0]. Here, first two are 0 and 7. Output first element is 0. So perhaps the first output element is 3 if the first two are both 0. Let's see. In Example 0's third input row: [0,0,0,1,5,0,5]. The output is [0,3,0]. Wait, first two elements are 0,0. Output's first element is 0, but maybe in the third position. Hmm, maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each output element is 3 based on the number of zeros in a certain part of the input. Let's check. For example, the first output element could be 3 if the first two elements are zeros. Let's see. Example 0's third input row has [0,0,0,1,5,0,5]. The output is [0,3,0]. The first two are 0,0. But the first output element is 0. So that doesn't fit.\n\nHmm, maybe looking at the positions after the 1. The fourth element is 1 in all input arrays. Then, the elements after that (positions 4,5,6) are 5,0,0 in the first input of Example 0. The output's third element is 3. Maybe the third output element is related to the presence of a 5 followed by zeros. Let's see.\n\nIn the first input of Example 0: positions 4,5,6 are 5,0,0. Output third element is 3. In the second input of Example 0: positions 4,5,6 are 5,0,0. Output third element is 3 again. Wait, but the third output element is 3 for both. Wait, no. Wait the first input's output is [0,0,3], the second input's output is [0,3,3]. So third element is 3 in both. Hmm, but the fifth and sixth elements are 0,0 in both. So maybe if positions 5 and 6 are both zero, then third output element is 3. Let's check.\n\nIn Example 0's third input: [0,0,0,1,5,0,5]. Positions 5 and 6 are 0 and 5. So not both zeros. The output's third element is 0. Which fits. Fourth input in Example 0: [0,0,0,1,5,5,0]. Positions 5 and 6 are 5 and 0. Not both zeros. Output third element is 3. Wait, no. That's conflicting. So maybe that's not the rule.\n\nAlternative approach: Let's look at the output elements and see what they have in common. The outputs are all 0s and 3s. Maybe each element in the output corresponds to a triplet of elements in the input array. Let's see: each input has seven elements. 7 elements divided into three parts. Maybe overlapping parts. Like first three, next three, next three? But 7 elements can't be split into three non-overlapping triplets. Alternatively, first two, next three, last two. That totals seven elements. So for the input array, split into [7,7], [0,1,5], [0,0]. Then for each part, check some condition.\n\nFor the first part (elements 0 and 1): [7,7] \u2192 maybe both non-zero and same. For the second part (elements 2,3,4): [0,1,5]. Third part (elements 5,6): [0,0]. How do these relate to the output?\n\nIn Example 0's first input: output is [0,0,3]. So first part: 7,7 \u2192 output 0. Second part: 0,1,5 \u2192 output 0. Third part: 0,0 \u2192 output 3. Hmm. Maybe each part's output is 3 if certain conditions are met.\n\nLooking at the third part (elements 5 and 6). For the first input, they are 0,0 \u2192 output third element is 3. Let's check other instances. In Example 0's fourth input: [0,0,0,1,5,5,0]. Third part is 5,0. The output third element is 3. So that's not matching. So maybe that's not the condition.\n\nAlternative idea: Maybe the third part (elements 5 and 6) has at least one 5. Let's see. First input's third part is 0,0 \u2192 no 5. Output third element is 3. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the sum of elements in the part. For the third part, sum is 0 in first input. Output is 3. Second input's third part sum 0, output third element 3. Third input's third part sum 5 (0+5), output 0. Fourth input's third part sum 5 (5+0), output 3. Hmm, inconsistent.\n\nWait, maybe the third output element is 3 if the sum of the third part is 0. First input's third part sum 0 \u2192 3. Second input's sum 0 \u2192 3. Third input sum 5 \u2192 0. Fourth input sum 5 \u2192 3. Wait, no. So that doesn't align.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the third output element is 3 if the third part has exactly two zeros. First input: two zeros \u2192 3. Second input: two zeros \u21923. Third input: one zero, one 5 \u2192 0. Fourth input: one 5 and one 0 \u2192 3? No, that's not consistent.\n\nHmm, maybe I need to think differently. Let's look for the occurrence of 5s and 7s. Let's check the first example's outputs. For instance, in Example 0's first output [0,0,3], perhaps each element corresponds to the presence of 7s, 5s, or something else.\n\nAnother approach: Let's consider the input arrays and their output arrays across all examples and see if there's a pattern in how they map.\n\nLooking at Example 1's input:\n\nInput row 0: [7,7,0,1,5,0,0] \u2192 output [0,0,3]\nRow1: [0,0,0,1,0,0,0] \u2192 [3,3,3]\nRow2: [7,7,0,1,5,0,0] \u2192 [0,0,3]\nRow3: [0,7,7,1,5,5,0] \u2192 [0,0,0]\n\nSo for row1 in Example1, the input is all zeros except for the fourth element (1) and fifth (0). The output is [3,3,3]. So what's special here? Maybe if there's a zero in position 4 (the fifth element), which is 0 here. So the output becomes all 3s. But in the other rows, for example, in Example0's third input row, position 4 is 5. Output is [0,3,0]. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output counts the number of times a certain pattern occurs. For instance, in the first example's row1, the input has 0s in all positions except position 3 (which is 1) and position4 (0). So perhaps when there's a 0 in position4 (element 5?), then the output is all 3s. Let's check. In Example1's row1, position4 is 0 (the fifth element is 0). Output is all 3s. In Example0's first input, position4 is 5. Output is [0,0,3]. So maybe when position4 is 5, the third output element is 3. But not sure.\n\nAlternatively, let's look at the second output element. In Example0's first input, output is [0,0,3]. The second output element is 0. What's in the middle part? The input elements 2,3,4 are 0,1,5. Maybe if the middle part (elements 2-4) contains a 1 followed by a 5, then the second output element is 3. Wait, in the first input, elements 3 and 4 are 1 and 5. So maybe if 1 is followed by 5 in positions 3 and 4 (which they are in all training examples), then the second output element is 0. But in Example0's second input, output is [0,3,3], so the second element is 3. Let's see why. The elements 2-4 are 0,1,5. So same as before. So that's not it.\n\nHmm, this is tricky. Maybe the output is determined by the presence of 7s and 5s in certain positions. Let's look at Example0's first input: [7,7,0,1,5,0,0]. The output is [0,0,3]. The first two elements are 7s. Maybe the first output element is 3 if there are two 7s at the start. But here it's 0. So that's not the case.\n\nWait, maybe the output elements are 3 if the corresponding part of the input has at least one 7. Let's check:\n\nFirst input in Example0: [7,7,0,1,5,0,0]. Parts are [7,7], [0,1,5], [0,0]. The first part has 7s. Output first element is 0. Second part has no 7s. Output second element is 0. Third part no 7s. Output third element is 3. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, if the part has a 5, the output element is 3. Third part in first input has no 5. Output is 3. So not.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each output element corresponds to the number of 5s and 7s in the part. For example, in the first part (elements 0 and 1), two 7s. Maybe the count is 2, but output is 0. So maybe not.\n\nAnother idea: The output could be related to the positions of 7s and 5s in the input. For example, in the input array, if there are 7s followed by 5s in certain positions, the output is 3. Let's look at Example0's first input: [7,7,0,1,5,0,0]. The 7s are at positions 0 and 1. The 5 is at position4. Maybe the first output element is 0 if there are 7s at the start. The third output element could be 3 because there's a 5 in position4 followed by zeros. But how does that relate?\n\nAlternatively, the third output element is 3 if there's a 5 in position4 and the following elements are zeros. Let's check:\n\nExample0 first input: 5 at position4, followed by 0,0 \u2192 output third element is 3. Second input: 5 at position4, followed by 0,0 \u2192 third element is 3. Third input: 5 at position4, followed by 0,5 \u2192 third element 0. Fourth input: 5 at position4, followed by 5,0 \u2192 third element 3. Hmm, inconsistent.\n\nWait, in Example0's fourth input, [0,0,0,1,5,5,0], position4 is 5, followed by 5 and 0. The third output element is 3. But in the third input, it's followed by 0 and 5 \u2192 output 0. So maybe the condition is that the 5 at position4 is followed by a 5 in position5? Or not. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the third output element is 3 if the sum of positions5 and 6 is 0. In the first input, positions5 and 6 are 0+0=0 \u2192 3. Second input same \u21923. Third input 0+5=5 \u21920. Fourth input 5+0=5 \u21923? No, but in Example0's fourth input, the output is [0,0,3]. So third element is 3. But sum is 5. So that's not matching.\n\nAlternative approach: Let's check if the output is determined by the presence of a 7 in the first three positions and a 5 in the last three.\n\nWait, perhaps each output element corresponds to a specific part of the input array and checks for the presence of certain numbers. For example:\n\n- Output[0]: check first two elements (positions 0 and 1) \u2192 if both are 7, then 0; if both are 0, then 3. Let's see.\n\nExample0's first input has [7,7] \u2192 output[0] is 0. Second input [7,0] \u2192 output[0] is 0. Third input [0,0] \u2192 output[0] is 0. Fourth input [0,0] \u2192 output[0] is 0. But in Example1's second input, [0,0,0,1,0,0,0], the first two are [0,0] \u2192 output[0] is 3. So maybe when the first two elements are both 0, output[0] is 3. Otherwise 0.\n\nBut in Example0's third and fourth inputs, first two elements are 0,0, but output[0] is 0. So that contradicts.\n\nHmm. Let's check Example1's input row1: [0,0,0,1,0,0,0]. Output is [3,3,3]. So all elements are 3. So maybe if the first two are 0,0, then output[0] is 3, and if the next three elements (positions 2,3,4) are 0,1,0 \u2192 which here they are 0,1,0. So maybe output[1] is 3 if positions 2,3,4 are 0,1,0. But how?\n\nThis is getting complicated. Maybe each output element corresponds to a specific rule:\n\n- Output[0] is 3 if the first two elements are both 0.\n- Output[1] is 3 if elements 2,3,4 are 0,1,0.\n- Output[2] is 3 if elements 5 and 6 are both 0.\n\nLet's test this with Example1's row1 input: [0,0,0,1,0,0,0]. First two are 0,0 \u2192 output[0] is 3. Elements 2,3,4 are 0,1,0 \u2192 output[1] is 3. Elements5,6 are 0,0 \u2192 output[2] is3. So output is [3,3,3]. Which matches.\n\nExample0's first input: [7,7,0,1,5,0,0]. First two are 7,7 \u2192 output[0] 0. Elements2,3,4 are0,1,5 \u2192 not 0,1,0 \u2192 output[1] 0. Elements5,6 0,0 \u2192 output[2] 3. So output [0,0,3]. Correct.\n\nExample0's second input: [7,0,0,1,5,0,0]. First two are7,0 \u2192 not both 0 \u2192 output[0] 0. Elements2,3,4:0,1,5 \u2192 output[1] 0. Elements5,6 0,0 \u2192 output[2]3. But actual output is [0,3,3]. So this contradicts. So output[1] is3 here. But according to our rule, output[1] should be 0. So this approach is incorrect.\n\nAlternative idea: Maybe output[1] is 3 if elements 2,3,4 are all zeros except for the 1. So for Example0's second input: elements2 is0,3 is1,4 is5. Not all zeros except 1. So output[1] would be 0, but actual output is3. So that's not it.\n\nAnother possibility: Maybe output[1] is 3 if there's a 0 in element2. Let's see. Example0's second input has element2=0, output[1] is3. In Example0's first input, element2=0, output[1]=0. So that's inconsistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe output[1] is 3 if elements3 and4 are1 and5. Which they are in most cases. For instance, in Example0's first input, elements3 and4 are1 and5. Output[1] is0. But in the second input, same elements3 and4, output[1] is3. So that's not the case.\n\nHmm. Let's think of another approach. The output has three elements per input. Maybe each element represents a count of something, but since they're only 0 or3, maybe it's modulo something. Or maybe it's ternary, but 3 is used instead of 1. Alternatively, each output element is 3 if a certain triplet of conditions is met.\n\nAlternatively, think of the output as three separate rules for each position. Let's try to find each rule.\n\nStarting with output[0]. Let's collect all instances where output[0] is 3 and see what the input looks like.\n\nLooking at Example1's row1: output[0] is3. Input's first two elements are0,0. In Example2's row3: [0,0,7,1,0,0,0] \u2192 output[0] is3 (output [3,3,0] in Example2's row3? Wait, no. Example2's outputs are:\n\nExample2:\n\nOutputs:\n\n[0,0,0]\n\n[3,0,0]\n\n[0,0,3]\n\n[3,3,0]\n\nWait, row3's output is [3,3,0]. So output[0] is3. The input for row3 is [0,0,7,1,0,0,0]. First two elements are0,0. So again, output[0] is3 when first two elements are0,0. Let's check other examples.\n\nExample3's third input row: [0,7,0,1,0,0,0] \u2192 output[0] is3. The first two elements are0 and7. So not both 0. But output[0] is3. So this breaks the pattern. Hmm.\n\nWait, in Example3's third input, the output is [3,0,3]. So output[0] is3. Input is [0,7,0,1,0,0,0]. First two elements are0,7. So our previous idea is wrong.\n\nSo maybe there's another condition. Let's think differently. Maybe output[0] is3 if there are no 7s in the first two elements. For example, in Example1's row1: [0,0, ...], output[0]3. Example2's row3: first two are0,0 \u2192 output3. But Example3's third input has a7 in position1, so output[0] is3. So that's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, output[0] is3 if there is at least one 7 in the first two elements. In Example3's third input, first two are0 and7 \u2192 has a7. Output[0]3. But Example1's row1 has 0,0 \u2192 no 7, output3. So that's conflicting.\n\nHmm. This is getting too confusing. Let's try to find another pattern.\n\nLooking at the outputs, sometimes they have all 3s, like in Example1's row1. Let's look at that input: [0,0,0,1,0,0,0]. The output is [3,3,3]. Maybe when all elements (except the fourth which is always 1) are zeros, output is all 3s. Let's check another instance. Example0's third input: [0,0,0,1,5,0,5]. Output is [0,3,0]. Not all zeros except 1, so output isn't all 3s. So that's not it.\n\nAlternative approach: Let's think of the output as three separate binary flags (0 or 3) indicating whether certain conditions are met. Each condition could be based on the presence or absence of certain numbers in specific parts of the input.\n\nMaybe:\n\n- Output[0]: 3 if the first two elements are both 0.\n- Output[1]: 3 if the middle three elements (positions 2,3,4) contain a 1 followed by a 5 (i.e., elements3 and4 are 1 and5).\n- Output[2]: 3 if the last two elements (positions5 and6) are both 0.\n\nLet's test this:\n\nExample0's first input:\n\n- Output[0]: 0 (7,7 \u2192 not 0,0 \u2192 0)\n- Output[1]: 3 if elements3 and4 are1,5 \u2192 yes \u2192 3. But actual output[1] is0. So this doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. So that's not working.\n\nAlternative idea for output[2]: 3 if the sum of positions5 and6 is even. For Example0's first input, 0+0=0 \u2192 even \u21923. Second input same. Third input 0+5=5 \u2192 odd \u21920. Fourth input5+0=5 \u2192 odd \u21920, but output is3. So no.\n\nAlternatively, output[2] is3 if positions5 and6 are the same. Example0's first input: 0 and0 \u2192 same \u21923. Second input same \u21923. Third input 0 and5 \u2192 different \u21920. Fourth input5 and0 \u2192 different \u2192 output3. So that doesn't fit.\n\nThis is really challenging. Let's look for another angle. Maybe the output elements correspond to the number of times a certain pattern occurs in the input array. For example, how many times 7 is followed by a 5, or something like that.\n\nAlternatively, think of the input as a sequence and the output as encoding some transitions. For instance, the first output element could indicate something about the beginning of the array, the middle about the middle, and the end about the end.\n\nWait, in Example0's first input: [7,7,0,1,5,0,0]. Output is [0,0,3]. Let's see, maybe:\n\n- 0,0: no transitions here, but the third element is3. The last two zeros could represent a transition to zeros.\n\nAlternatively, the output is based on the presence of specific triplets. For example, the output is [0,0,3] if the last two elements are zero. But Example0's fourth input's last element is0, but the output's third element is3.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the third output element is3 if the last element is zero. First input's last element is0 \u21923. Second input same. Third input's last element is5 \u21920. Fourth input's last element is0 \u21923. That fits. Let's check other examples.\n\nExample1's row3: input [0,7,7,1,5,5,0]. Last element is0 \u2192 output third element is0. So that contradicts. But in Example1's row3's output is [0,0,0]. So no. So that's not the rule.\n\nAnother idea: Maybe the output elements are 3 if the corresponding part of the input has a certain sum. For example:\n\n- Output[0] is3 if sum of first two elements is even.\n\nIn Example0's first input:7+7=14 \u2192 even. Output[0] is0. So that doesn't work.\n\nAlternatively, sum is a multiple of 3. 7+7=14 \u2192 no. So no.\n\nAnother approach: Maybe each output element is 3 if the corresponding part of the input contains exactly two 7s. For example:\n\n- Output[0]: first two elements. If they are both 7s, then3. Example0's first input has two 7s \u2192 output[0]0. So that's not.\n\nAlternatively, exactly one 7. First input's first part has two, output0. Second input's first part has one7 (7,0) \u2192 output0. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, if there's at least one 7 in the part. For the first part, output0 when two 7s. But in Example1's row3's first part is0 and7 \u2192 has a7 \u2192 output0. So no.\n\nThis is taking too long. Let's try to think of a different pattern. Maybe the output is determined by the positions of 5s and 7s in the input array.\n\nFor example, each output element corresponds to a segment of the input array and checks if there's a 7 followed by a5, or something like that.\n\nAlternatively, the output array is related to the count of non-zero numbers in specific segments.\n\nLet me take Example0's outputs and see:\n\nInput rows:\n\nRow0: [7,7,0,1,5,0,0] \u2192 output [0,0,3]\nRow1: [7,0,0,1,5,0,0] \u2192 [0,3,3]\nRow2: [0,0,0,1,5,0,5] \u2192 [0,3,0]\nRow3: [0,0,0,1,5,5,0] \u2192 [0,0,3]\n\nLooking for commonalities. Maybe each output element is 3 if the corresponding segment has a certain number of non-zero elements.\n\nFor example:\n\n- Segment0: first two elements. Row0 has two non-zeros \u2192 output0. Row1 has one \u2192 output0. Row2 has zero \u2192 output0. Row3 has zero \u2192 output0. All output0 for segment0. But Example1's row1 has zero non-zeros in segment0 and output3.\n\nSo that's not it.\n\nAnother idea: Perhaps the output counts the number of times a 7 or 5 appears in a certain segment, modulo 4 or something. But since the outputs are 0 and3, maybe modulo 4, 3 is when the count is 3.\n\nAlternatively, each output element is 3 if the sum of the segment is divisible by3.\n\nFor Example0's segment0 (7+7=14 \u219214%3=2 \u2192 not 0. Output0. Row1's segment0:7+0=7 \u21927%3=1 \u2192 output0. Row2:0+0=0 \u21920%3=0 \u2192 output0. Row3:0+0=0 \u2192 output0. So all output0. But Example1's row1's segment0 sum0 \u21920%3=0 \u2192 output3. So that fits. So maybe output is3 when sum is divisible by3. But in Example0's row0, sum14%3=2 \u2192 output0. Example1's row1 sum0 \u21923. Example0's row3 sum0 \u2192 output0. So conflicting.\n\nSo perhaps the rule is output3 if the sum is 0. But sum0 in Example0's row3's segment0 (0+0=0) \u2192 output0. So no.\n\nThis is really challenging. Maybe I should look for another pattern.\n\nLooking at the test input:\n\nTest Input:\n\n[0,0,0,1,0,5,0]\n[7,7,7,1,5,5,0]\n[0,0,0,1,5,0,0]\n[7,0,0,1,5,5,5]\n\nWe need to generate outputs for each of these four rows. Let's see if we can find a pattern in the training examples that applies here.\n\nLooking back at the training examples, perhaps each output element is determined by the presence of 7s and 5s in certain positions.\n\nFor example:\n\n- Output[0] is3 if the first two elements are both0.\n\n- Output[1] is3 if the middle three elements (2,3,4) contain a 1 followed by a5 (i.e., position3 is1 and position4 is5).\n\n- Output[2] is3 if the last two elements are both0.\n\nLet's test this with the training examples.\n\nExample0's first input:\n\n- Output[0]: 0 (7,7) \u2192 0.\n\n- Output[1]: 3 if position3 is1 and4 is5 \u2192 yes. So output[1] should be3, but actual is0. So this doesn't fit.\n\nExample1's row1 input:\n\n- First two elements are0,0 \u2192 output[0]3.\n\n- Middle elements0,1,0 \u2192 position3 is1, position4 is0 \u2192 output[1]3. But actual output is3. So maybe the condition is position3 is1 and position4 is anything. But in this case, position4 is0. So that's not.\n\nHmm. Another approach: Maybe output[1] is3 if there is a 0 in position2. Let's see.\n\nExample0's first input: position2 is0 \u2192 output[1]0.\n\nExample0's second input: position2 is0 \u2192 output[1]3.\n\nNo, inconsistent.\n\nAlternatively, output[1] is3 if the middle three elements (2-4) have exactly one non-zero. For Example0's first input, middle elements are0,1,5 \u2192 two non-zeros. So output[1]0. Second input:0,1,5 \u2192 same. Output[1]3. No, doesn't fit.\n\nWait, maybe output[1] is3 if position4 is5. Let's check:\n\nIn Example0's first input, position4 is5 \u2192 output[1]0. So no.\n\nExample0's second input, position4 is5 \u2192 output[1]3. So inconsistency.\n\nThis is getting me stuck. Let's think of the test input and try to apply possible patterns.\n\nTest input row0: [0,0,0,1,0,5,0]\n\nIf output[0] is3 when first two are0,0 \u2192 yes. So output0 would be3.\n\nFor output[1], maybe if middle elements (2-4:0,1,0) \u2192 if there's a 1 followed by a0, maybe output1 is3. In Example1's row1, middle elements are0,1,0 and output1 is3. So maybe yes.\n\nFor output[2], if last two are5 and0 \u2192 not both0 \u2192 output2 is0.\n\nSo output for row0 would be [3,3,0].\n\nTest input row1: [7,7,7,1,5,5,0]\n\nFirst two are7,7 \u2192 output0 is0.\n\nMiddle elements7,1,5 \u2192 position3 is1, position4 is5 \u2192 output1 is3.\n\nLast two are5,0 \u2192 not both0 \u2192 output2 is0. So output [0,3,0].\n\nRow2: [0,0,0,1,5,0,0]\n\nFirst two 0,0 \u2192 output0 is3.\n\nMiddle elements0,1,5 \u2192 if position3 is1 and4 is5 \u2192 output1 is3.\n\nLast two 0,0 \u2192 output2 is3. So output [3,3,3].\n\nRow3: [7,0,0,1,5,5,5]\n\nFirst two7,0 \u2192 output0 is0.\n\nMiddle elements0,1,5 \u2192 output1 is3.\n\nLast two5,5 \u2192 output2 is0. So output [0,3,0].\n\nBut looking at the training examples, when was the output all 3s? In Example1's row1, it's [3,3,3]. So maybe that's possible for row2 of the test input.\n\nBut let's check if this aligns with training examples. For instance, Example1's row1 input has middle elements0,1,0, and output[1] is3. So maybe the rule for output[1] is if there's a 1 in position3, regardless of position4. So if position3 is1, output1 is3. Let's see:\n\nExample0's first input has position3 as1 \u2192 output1 is0. So that contradicts. So that's not the rule.\n\nAlternatively, output[1] is3 if position3 is1 and position2 is0. For Example1's row1: position2 is0 \u2192 yes. Example0's first input: position2 is0 \u2192 yes, but output1 is0. So no.\n\nThis is not working. I think I'm missing something. Let me try to find another pattern.\n\nLooking at the output arrays across all examples, maybe they relate to the number of 7s and 5s in certain positions.\n\nFor example:\n\n- For each input row, count the number of 7s and 5s in different parts.\n\nBut how?\n\nExample0's first input: [7,7,0,1,5,0,0]. 7s in first two, 5 in position4. Output [0,0,3].\n\nExample0's second input: [7,0,0,1,5,0,0]. One 7, one5. Output [0,3,3].\n\nExample0's third input: [0,0,0,1,5,0,5]. Two 5s. Output [0,3,0].\n\nExample0's fourth input: [0,0,0,1,5,5,0]. Two 5s. Output [0,0,3].\n\nHmm. Maybe output[2] is3 if the number of 5s in the last two positions is even. But in Example0's first input, last two have 0,0 \u2192 zero 5s (even) \u21923. Third input has 0,5 \u2192 one (odd) \u21920. Fourth input has5,0 \u2192 one (odd) \u21923. Doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, output[2] is3 if the sum of the last two elements is0. In first input:0+0=0 \u21923. Second input:0+0=0 \u21923. Third input:0+5=5 \u21920. Fourth input:5+0=5 \u21920. So output[2] would be3 only if sum is0. That fits for Example0. Let's check other examples.\n\nExample1's row3 input: [0,7,7,1,5,5,0]. Last two are5,0 \u2192 sum5 \u2192 output[2]0. Correct.\n\nExample2's row0 input: [0,7,7,1,5,0,0]. Last two sum0 \u2192 output[2]0. But output is [0,0,0]. So that contradicts.\n\nWait, this is conflicting. So sum being zero doesn't always lead to3. So that's not the rule.\n\nAlternative idea: Maybe the output is related to the presence of 5 in certain positions. For example, output[2] is3 if there's a 5 in position5 or 6. Let's see.\n\nExample0's first input: position5 and6 are0,0 \u2192 no5 \u2192 output3. Example0's second input: same \u21923. Example0's third input: position6 is5 \u2192 output0. Example0's fourth input: position5 is5 \u2192 output3. So no clear pattern.\n\nThis is really challenging. Let's try to look for another approach.\n\nPerhaps the output elements are determined by the following rules:\n\n- For output[0]: 3 if the first two elements are both 0.\n- For output[1]: 3 if there is a 0 in position2 and position4 is 5.\n- For output[2]: 3 if the last two elements are both 0.\n\nLet's test this with Example0's first input:\n\noutput[0]: 0 (not 0,0)\noutput[1]: position2 is0 and position4 is5 \u2192 yes \u21923. But actual output[1] is0. So no.\n\nExample1's row1:\n\noutput[0]:3 (0,0)\noutput[1]: position2 is0, position4 is0 \u2192 no \u21920. But actual output[1] is3. So no.\n\nHmm. Not working.\n\nAnother possibility: Each output element is 3 if the corresponding part of the input contains a 5.\n\n- Output[0]: first two elements \u2192 no5.\n- Output[1]: middle three elements (2-4) \u2192 has5 in position4 \u2192 yes \u21923.\n- Output[2]: last two \u2192 no5.\n\nBut in Example0's first input, output[1] is0. So no.\n\nAlternatively, if the part contains a 7:\n\n- Output[0]: first two have7 \u21920.\n- Output[1]: middle three no7 \u21920.\n- Output[2]: last two no7 \u21923.\n\nBut why output[2] is3? Not clear.\n\nI think I'm stuck. Maybe I should look for a different pattern. Let's try to see what the outputs have in common across the training examples.\n\nLooking at the outputs:\n\nIn Example0, the outputs are:\n\n[0,0,3], [0,3,3], [0,3,0], [0,0,3]\n\nNotice that the third output element is3 whenever the last two elements of the input are zeros. For Example0's first input: yes \u21923. Second input: yes \u21923. Third input: last two are0,5 \u2192 no \u21920. Fourth input: last two are5,0 \u2192 no \u21923. Wait, but the fourth input's last two are5,0 \u2192 sum5. But output is3. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, the third output element is3 if the last two elements are both zeros. That works for Example0's first and second inputs. Third input has0,5 \u2192 no \u21920. Fourth input has5,0 \u2192 no \u21923. So no.\n\nBut the fourth input's output is3. So that breaks the pattern.\n\nAlternatively, third output element is3 if either of the last two elements is zero. In Example0's fourth input: last element is0 \u21923. Third input's last element is5 \u21920. But first input's last two are0,0 \u21923. Second input same \u21923. So this might fit. But Example1's row3 input has last element0 \u2192 output third element is0. So no.\n\nThis is not working.\n\nPerhaps the output is determined by the presence of a 5 in position4 (element4) and the following elements. For example:\n\n- If position4 is5 and position5 and6 are both0 \u2192 output[2]3.\n\nExample0's first input: 5 in position4, 5 and6 are0 \u21923. Yes. Second input same \u21923. Third input: position4 is5, 5 and6 are0 and5 \u2192 not both0 \u21920. Fourth input: position4 is5, 5 and6 are5 and0 \u2192 not both0 \u21923. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAnother Idea: Maybe each output element corresponds to a pair of elements in the input. For example:\n\nOutput[0] is3 if elements0 and1 are both0.\n\nOutput[1] is3 if elements3 and4 are1 and5.\n\nOutput[2] is3 if elements5 and6 are both0.\n\nLet's test this:\n\nExample0's first input:\n\n- elements0-1:7,7 \u2192 output0 0.\n\n- elements3-4:1,5 \u2192 output1 3. But actual output1 is0. So no.\n\nExample1's row1:\n\n- elements0-1:0,0 \u2192 output0 3.\n\n- elements3-4:1,0 \u2192 output1 0. But actual output1 is3. So no.\n\nThis doesn't fit.\n\nAlternative idea: Maybe the output is based on the presence of the sequence 7,7,0 in the input. But I don't see how that would map.\n\nAlternatively, think of the input as being split into three sections, and each section's parity (even/odd) determines the output.\n\nFor example, each section's sum is even \u21920, odd \u21923.\n\nBut in Example0's first input:\n\n- section0:7+7=14 (even) \u21920.\n\n- section1:0+1+5=6 (even) \u21920.\n\n- section2:0+0=0 (even) \u21920. But output is [0,0,3]. So no.\n\nAnother Idea: Maybe the output is the count of 7s and 5s in each section modulo 4. For example:\n\n- section0: number of 7s and5s. 2 7s \u21922 \u2192 2 mod4=2 \u2192 not3.\n\nBut this isn't leading anywhere.\n\nAt this point, I'm really stuck. Given the time I've spent and the lack of progress, maybe I should look for a different angle. Perhaps the output is related to the indices where 7s and5s are present.\n\nFor instance, maybe each output element corresponds to a specific position in the input array, and if there's a7 or5 there, it contributes to the output.\n\nAlternatively, the output is the number of times 7 appears in certain positions minus the number of times 5 appears in others.\n\nAlternatively, the output elements are 3 when the corresponding part of the input array has more 7s than5s, or vice versa.\n\nBut this is speculative.\n\nLet's try to see Example0's first input:\n\nSections:\n\n[7,7], [0,1,5], [0,0]\n\nOutput [0,0,3].\n\nIn the first section, two 7s, no5s \u2192 maybe 0.\n\nSecond section: 0 7s, one5 \u2192 maybe 0.\n\nThird section: no7s or5s \u21923.\n\nBut why?\n\nExample0's fourth input:\n\n[0,0,0,1,5,5,0]\n\nSections:\n\n[0,0], [0,1,5], [5,0]\n\nOutput [0,0,3].\n\nThird section has a5, but output is3. So not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe third section has no7s and no5s \u21923. But first input's third section has zeros \u21923. Fourth input's third section has a5 \u21923. So no.\n\nThis is not working.\n\nGiven that I'm not able to find a clear pattern, maybe I should look for a different approach. Perhaps the output is the result of some bitwise operations or encoded information.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is determined by the presence of certain digits in specific positions. For example:\n\n- Output[0] is3 if there's a7 in position0 or1.\n\nBut in Example0's first input, positions0 and1 are7,7 \u2192 output0 0. So no.\n\nAlternatively, output[0] is3 if there are no7s in positions0 and1. In Example1's row1, positions0-1 are0,0 \u2192 output3. Example0's third input, positions0-1 are0,0 \u2192 output0. So no.\n\nThis is frustrating. Given the time I've invested and the lack of progress, perhaps I need to make an educated guess based on the test input and training examples.\n\nLooking at the test input:\n\nRow0: [0,0,0,1,0,5,0]\n\nFirst two elements are0,0 \u2192 perhaps output[0]3.\n\nMiddle elements0,1,0 \u2192 maybe output[1]3 (like Example1's row1).\n\nLast two elements5,0 \u2192 output[2]0.\n\nSo output [3,3,0].\n\nRow1: [7,7,7,1,5,5,0]\n\nFirst two 7,7 \u2192 output0 0.\n\nMiddle elements7,1,5 \u2192 perhaps output1 3.\n\nLast two5,0 \u2192 output2 0.\n\nSo [0,3,0].\n\nRow2: [0,0,0,1,5,0,0]\n\nFirst two0,0 \u21923.\n\nMiddle0,1,5 \u2192 output1 3? Because in Example0's first input, middle was0,1,5 \u2192 output1 0, but in Example0's second input, middle was0,1,5 \u2192 output1 3. Not sure.\n\nBut in Example4's row0 input: [7,0,0,1,0,5,0] \u2192 output [0,0,3]. Middle elements0,1,0 \u2192 output1 0. But in Example1's row1, middle elements0,1,0 \u2192 output1 3. So conflicting.\n\nBut in the test row2, middle elements are0,1,5. In Example0's first input, this combination led to output1 0, but in Example0's second input, it led to output1 3. So no clear pattern.\n\nPerhaps in the test row2, output1 is3. Last two are0,0 \u2192 output2 3. So output [3,3,3].\n\nRow3: [7,0,0,1,5,5,5]\n\nFirst two7,0 \u2192 output0 0.\n\nMiddle0,1,5 \u2192 output1 3.\n\nLast two5,5 \u2192 output2 0.\n\nSo [0,3,0].\n\nLooking at the training examples, the output [3,3,3] appears in Example1's row1. So it's possible.\n\nPutting it all together, the test output would be:\n\n[3,3,0]\n\n[0,3,0]\n\n[3,3,3]\n\n[0,3,0]\n\nBut looking at the training examples, the outputs are in lists of four, each with three elements. For example, the training outputs have four rows. The test input has four rows. So the answer should have four output arrays.\n\nBut according to this guess, the test output would be:\n\nFor the test input:\n\nRow0: [3,3,0]\n\nRow1: [0,3,0]\n\nRow2: [3,3,3]\n\nRow3: [0,3,0]\n\nBut I need to check if this matches any patterns in the training examples.\n\nExample1's row1 is [0,0,0,1,0,0,0] \u2192 output [3,3,3]. So when first two are0,0, middle is0,1,0, last are0,0 \u2192 output all3s. Test row2 has first two0,0, middle0,1,5, last0,0. So different middle. So perhaps not. But in test row2, last two are0,0 \u2192 output2 3. So [3, ?,3]. If output1 is3, then [3,3,3].\n\nBut in training Example0's first input, middle is0,1,5, output1 is0. So maybe output1 is0 here. So test row2's output would be [3,0,3].\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and the lack of a clear pattern, I'll proceed with the initial guess and see.",

        "cot_2": "Okay, let's see. I need to figure out the pattern that maps the input lists to the output lists in these training examples. Let me start by looking at each example and trying to see what's going on.\n\nLooking at Example 0. The input has four arrays. Let's look at their outputs. The output arrays are all of length 3. The first output is [0,0,3], then [0,3,3], [0,3,0], and [0,0,3]. Hmm. So for each input array in the example, there's a corresponding output array. So maybe each element in the output is determined by some transformation of the input array.\n\nLet me take the first input of Example 0: [7,7,0,1,5,0,0]. The output is [0,0,3]. Let's see. What's special about 3 here? Maybe it's counting something. Let's check the positions of the numbers. The input array has elements at indices 0-6. Maybe the output is based on the positions of certain numbers.\n\nWait, looking at the input arrays, they all have 1 and 5 in positions 3 and 4. Like in the first input array of Example 0: index 3 is 1, index 4 is 5. Then the rest are 7s and 0s and 5s. Maybe the 1 and 5 are fixed, and the other elements are being processed somehow.\n\nLooking at the output for the first input in Example 0: [0,0,3]. The 3 could be the sum of certain elements. Or maybe the count of a particular number. Let's see: the input is [7,7,0,1,5,0,0]. If we look at the elements except the 1 and 5 (positions 3 and 4), the elements are 7,7,0,0,0. Maybe the numbers before 1 (indices 0-2) and after 5 (indices 5-6) are considered. Let's split the input into parts before 1 (positions 0-2), then the 1 and 5 (positions 3-4), and after 5 (positions 5-6). So the first part is [7,7,0], the second part is [1,5], the third part is [0,0].\n\nNow, maybe the output is three numbers, each corresponding to these three parts. For the first input in Example 0, the output is [0,0,3]. So perhaps each part is processed to get a number. Let's check.\n\nFirst part: [7,7,0]. What's the sum? 14. But the output here is 0. So maybe not sum. Maybe count of non-zero numbers? There are two 7s and a 0. So non-zero count is 2. But output is 0. Hmm, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the numbers after 1 and 5. Wait, the 1 is at position 3, then 5 at 4. So after that, positions 5 and 6. The third part here is [0,0], which sums to 0. But the third element in the output is 3. So that's not matching.\n\nWait, maybe the 3 is the count of 5s in the input array? Let's check. The first input array of Example 0: 5 is present once. But the output's third element is 3. That doesn't add up.\n\nAlternatively, maybe looking for sequences. For example, in the first input of Example 0, the output is [0,0,3]. Maybe each element in the output corresponds to a certain position in the input array. Or perhaps the number of times a certain condition is met in each of the three sections.\n\nWait, let's look at the output elements. The possible values are 0 and 3, or maybe multiples of 3. All outputs are either 0 or 3. So maybe each output element is 3 if a certain condition is met, else 0.\n\nLooking at the first example's first output [0,0,3]. The third part (positions 5-6) is [0,0]. But output's third element is 3. Hmm. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's related to the positions where numbers change. For example, in the first input array [7,7,0,1,5,0,0], the first part [7,7,0] has a transition from 7 to 0. Maybe transitions between numbers count as something.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is the count of 7s, 0s, and 5s in each of the three parts. Let's see. For the first input in Example 0:\n\nFirst part (0-2): 7,7,0 \u2192 2 sevens, 1 zero. Maybe the count of 7s here is 2. But the first output is 0. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe each output element is 3 if there's a certain number of non-zero elements in each part. Let's try:\n\nFirst part: [7,7,0] \u2192 2 non-zero. Second part is [1,5] (fixed?), so maybe not considered. Third part [0,0] \u2192 0 non-zero. So how does that relate to the output [0,0,3]?\n\nAlternatively, maybe each output element is 3 multiplied by the number of non-zero elements in each part divided by some number. But 2 non-zero in the first part, but output is 0. So that doesn't fit.\n\nWait, let's look at the third part of the first input in Example 0. The third part (positions 5-6) is [0,0]. But the output's third element is 3. That's confusing. How does zero non-zeros become 3? Maybe not.\n\nLet me check another example. Let's look at Example 1's first input:\n\nInput is [7,7,0,1,5,0,0]. Output is [0,0,3]. Let's split into parts as before. First part [7,7,0], second [1,5], third [0,0]. The output is 0,0,3. How?\n\nWait, maybe the output is based on the sum of certain digits. Like, each part's sum modulo something. First part sum is 7+7+0=14. 14 mod 3 is 2. But output is 0. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe looking at the presence of 7s and 5s. For example, in the first part, if there are 7s followed by 0s, maybe that's a pattern. But how does that translate to 0?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the number of times a 7 is followed by a 0 in each part. Let's see. First part: 7,7,0. The transitions are 7\u21927 (no), 7\u21920 (yes). So one occurrence. But output is 0. So that's not it.\n\nWait, another idea: the output is related to the count of a particular digit in the input array. Let's see. For the first input in Example 0, the third output is 3. The input array has a 5 in position 4 and 0s elsewhere. But maybe the third element counts the number of 5s in the third part. Wait, the third part is positions 5-6, which are 0,0. No 5s there. So that's not it.\n\nHmm. Let's think of another approach. Maybe the output is determined by the positions of the 5s and 7s in the input arrays. Let's look at the outputs. For example, in the first input of Example 0, the output is [0,0,3]. Maybe each element in the output represents a certain condition in each third of the input array. The input array is split into three parts: first three elements, then the next two (1 and 5), then the last two. So three parts. Then, for each part, the output is 3 if some condition is met, else 0.\n\nBut what condition? Let's see:\n\nIn Example 0's first input:\n\nFirst part: [7,7,0] \u2192 maybe if there are two 7s followed by a 0. The output is 0 here. Not sure.\n\nThird part: [0,0] \u2192 output is 3. So maybe if the third part is all zeros, then output 3. But [0,0] is all zeros, so 3. But in that case, why is the third element 3?\n\nWait, let's check another case. In Example 0's second input:\n\nInput is [7,0,0,1,5,0,0]. Output is [0,3,3]. Split into parts:\n\nFirst part [7,0,0]. Third part [0,0]. But output third element is 3. So same as before. Maybe the third part being all zeros gives 3.\n\nBut the first part here is [7,0,0]. If the first part has a 7 followed by zeros, maybe that's a condition. But the output is 0. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output counts how many times a certain sequence occurs in each part. For example, in the first part, if there's a 7 followed by a 0, that's a count. But the first part of the first input (7,7,0) has one 7 followed by 0. But the output is 0. So that's not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output elements correspond to the presence of 7s or 5s in certain positions. For example, the first output element is 3 if there's a 7 in the first part, but that doesn't hold.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each output element represents a binary condition (0 or 3) based on whether a certain pattern exists in each part. Let's think:\n\nIn Example 0's first input, the first part is [7,7,0]. Maybe if there are two 7s, then 3. But output is 0. No. Or maybe if there are two consecutive 7s followed by a 0. That's exactly the case here, but output is 0. So that's not it.\n\nHmm, maybe I should look for another pattern. Let's check other examples.\n\nTake Example 1's output. The second input is [0,0,0,1,0,0,0]. The output is [3,3,3]. Wait, the input here is split into parts: first three are [0,0,0], then [1,0], then [0,0]. The output is [3,3,3]. So each part gives 3. How?\n\nFirst part is all zeros. Third part is all zeros. But in this case, the output is 3 for all parts. But why?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is 3 for each part that has all zeros. So the first part in this case is all zeros \u2192 3. Second part is [1,0] \u2192 not all zeros. But output here is [3,3,3], so the middle element is 3. That doesn't fit. So that idea is wrong.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the sum of each part. Let's compute:\n\nFor Example 1's second input, parts:\n\nFirst part: sum 0+0+0=0 \u2192 output element 3.\n\nSecond part: sum 1+0=1 \u2192 output 3.\n\nThird part: 0+0=0 \u2192 3.\n\nSo sum of 0 gives 3, sum of 1 gives 3. That's inconsistent.\n\nAnother angle: the numbers 7, 1, 5 are in positions 0-2, 3, 4, and 5-6. Maybe 1 and 5 are fixed, and the other elements are grouped as before. But how?\n\nWait, the input arrays all have 1 at position 3 and 5 at position 4. So maybe the parts are:\n\n- Before 1 (indices 0-2),\n- 1 and 5 (indices 3-4),\n- After 5 (indices 5-6).\n\nThen, for each of these three parts, the output is 0 or 3. So for each part, some condition is checked. If met, 3, else 0.\n\nSo in Example 0's first input:\n\nFirst part [7,7,0], second [1,5], third [0,0].\n\nThe output is [0,0,3]. So the third part gives 3. What's special about the third part here? It's two zeros. So perhaps if the third part has all zeros, then 3. But in the first input of Example 0, third part is zeros \u2192 3. Then in the second input of Example 0, third part is [0,0], output third element is 3. But in the second input's third part, it's [0,0], and output is [0,3,3]. Wait, maybe I'm missing something.\n\nWait the second input in Example 0 is [7,0,0,1,5,0,0]. Output is [0,3,3]. So first part is [7,0,0], second [1,5], third [0,0]. Output is [0,3,3]. So first part gives 0, second gives 3, third gives 3. Hmm. So maybe the second part (1 and 5) is also considered. But in that case, the output's second element is 3. So what's the condition here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the sum of the first part, second part, and third part. Let's compute:\n\nFirst part sum: 7+0+0=7. 7 mod something. 7 mod 4 is 3. But output is 0. Not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the number of non-zero elements in each part. For the second input of Example 0:\n\nFirst part [7,0,0] \u2192 1 non-zero. Second part [1,5] \u2192 2 non-zero. Third part [0,0] \u2192 0. So output is [0,3,3]. So maybe if the count is 2, output is 3. Wait, second part has 2 non-zero, output second element is 3. Third part has 0 non-zero, but output third is 3. So that's inconsistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the presence of any 7s or 5s in each part. Let's see:\n\nFirst part: 7 \u2192 yes. So output 0. Hmm. Not.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the first part is checked for 7s, the second part is fixed, and the third part for 5s. For example, first part: if there are any 7s, output 0, else 3. But first input's first part has 7s and output is 0, which fits. The second input's first part has a 7, output is 0. Third input's first part in Example 0 is [0,0,0], output is 0. Wait, but the third input in Example 0 is [0,0,0,1,5,0,5], output is [0,3,0]. So first part is zeros, but output first element is 0. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the first part is checked for all zeros. If yes, output 3 for first element. But in Example 0's third input, the first part is all zeros, output first element is 0, which contradicts.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Let me try to find another approach.\n\nLooking at the outputs, all are combinations of 0 and 3. So maybe each output element is 3 if a certain condition is met in the corresponding part, else 0.\n\nLet's look at the third part of the first input in Example 0: [0,0] \u2192 output 3. Third input of Example 0: third part is [0,5], output third element is 0. Fourth input: third part [5,0], output is 3. Hmm. Wait, in the first input, third part is zeros \u2192 3. In the fourth input of Example 0, third part is [5,0], which is not all zeros. But output third element is 3. That contradicts.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the third part's sum. In first input's third part: sum 0. Output 3. In fourth input's third part: sum 5+0=5. Output is 3. So sum doesn't matter.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the presence of a 5 in the third part. Let's check:\n\nFirst input's third part: no 5, output 3. Fourth input's third part: 5 and 0 \u2192 has a 5. Output is 3. Third input's third part has 0 and 5: has a 5. But output third element is 0. So that's inconsistent.\n\nHmm. Let's take another example. Example 2's first input is [0,7,7,1,5,0,0]. Output is [0,0,0]. So parts:\n\nFirst: [0,7,7], second: [1,5], third: [0,0]. Output [0,0,0]. So why no 3s here?\n\nAnother example: Example 4's first input is [7,0,0,1,0,5,0]. Output is [0,0,3]. The parts are:\n\nFirst: [7,0,0], second: [1,0], third: [5,0]. The output third element is 3. So third part has a 5 and 0. So maybe the presence of a 5 in the third part gives 3. Because in Example 4's first input, third part has 5 \u2192 output 3. But in Example 0's third input, third part has 5, but output is 0. So that's not consistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the third part has exactly one 5. Example 4's first input third part has one 5 \u2192 output 3. Example 0's third input third part has one 5 (position 6 is 5), but output third element is 0. So no.\n\nAnother angle: perhaps the output elements correspond to the count of non-zero elements multiplied by 3. For example, first part non-zero count *3. Let's check:\n\nExample 0's first input first part: 2 non-zero (7,7) \u2192 2*3=6 \u2192 not 0. Doesn't fit.\n\nExample 1's second input first part: 0 non-zero \u2192 0*3=0. But output first element is 3. So that's not right.\n\nHmm. Maybe the output is based on the number of times a certain transition happens. For example, in each part, how many times a number is followed by a different number. Let's see.\n\nExample 0's first input first part: [7,7,0]. Transitions: 7\u21927 (no change), 7\u21920 (change). So 1 transition. But output is 0. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the number of times a 0 occurs in a part. For example, first part has 1 zero. But output is 0. Third part has 2 zeros. Output third element is 3. Not sure.\n\nWait, maybe each output element is 3 if the corresponding part has an even number of zeros, else 0. For Example 0's first input third part has 2 zeros (even), output 3. First part has 1 zero (odd), output 0. Second part (1 and5) has no zeros, which is even (0 zeros), but output second element is 0. So that's not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the number of 7s in the part. First part in Example 0's first input has two 7s. Output is 0. So that's not it.\n\nWait, let's look at the outputs again. For Example 0's outputs:\n\n[0,0,3]\n\n[0,3,3]\n\n[0,3,0]\n\n[0,0,3]\n\nThe second example's output has a 3 in the second position. How?\n\nLooking at Example 0's second input: [0,0,0,1,5,5,0]. So parts:\n\nFirst: [0,0,0], second: [1,5], third: [5,0].\n\nOutput is [0,3,3]. So first part all zeros \u2192 output 0. Second part [1,5], output 3. Third part [5,0], output 3.\n\nHmm. Maybe the second part (1 and 5) is always [1,5], but the output's second element varies. Like in Example 0's first input, the second part is [1,5], output second element is 0. In the second input of Example 0, the second part is [1,5], output second element is 3. So the same part but different outputs. So that's not the case. Therefore, the output's second element isn't based on the second part.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output elements correspond to the first, third, and fifth parts? Wait, no. The input arrays are split into three parts: first three elements, then two, then two.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is based on the positions of the digits 7 and 5 in the entire array, not per part.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output counts the number of 7s in the first part, the number of 5s in the third part, and something else. Let's see:\n\nExample 0's first input first part has 2 7s \u2192 output first element is 0. Third part has 0 5s \u2192 output third element is 3. Doesn't fit.\n\nAnother approach: Let's look at the test input and see if I can find a pattern that applies to it once I figure it out. But I need to solve this.\n\nLooking at the outputs, sometimes the third element is 3 even if there's a 5 in the third part. Like Example 4's first input third part is [5,0], output third is 3. But in Example 0's third input, third part is [0,5], output third is 0. Hmm. So presence of 5 in third part sometimes gives 3, sometimes 0. What's the difference?\n\nWait, in Example 4's first input, third part is [5,0], which has a 5 followed by 0. In Example 0's third input, third part is [0,5]. So maybe the order matters. Like if there's a 5 followed by a 0, then output 3. If it's 0 followed by 5, then 0.\n\nLet me check:\n\nExample 4's first input third part [5,0] \u2192 5 followed by 0 \u2192 output third element is 3.\n\nExample 0's third input third part [0,5] \u2192 0 followed by 5 \u2192 output is 0.\n\nExample 0's fourth input third part [5,0] \u2192 output third element is 3.\n\nSo that seems to fit. So for the third part, if the two elements are 5 followed by 0, output is 3. Otherwise, 0. \n\nBut wait, in Example 0's second input third part is [0,0], output third element is 3. So that's not covered by the 5 and 0 pattern. So maybe there's another rule for when the third part has all zeros.\n\nSo for the third part:\n\n- If both elements are 0 \u2192 3.\n\n- If the third part is 5 followed by 0 \u2192 3.\n\n- If it's 0 followed by 5 \u2192 0.\n\nSo combining these two conditions. So third part is [0,0] \u2192 3, [5,0] \u2192 3, [0,5] \u2192 0, [5,5] \u2192 ?\n\nWait, looking at Example 0's third input, third part is [0,5], output third element is 0. Example 0's fourth input third part is [5,0], output is 3. Example 4's first input third part [5,0] \u2192 output 3.\n\nSo the third part's output is 3 if the part is [0,0] or [5,0]. Otherwise 0.\n\nNow, the first and second parts of the output: how are they determined?\n\nLet's look at the first part. For Example 0's first input, first part is [7,7,0], output first element is 0. Second input's first part [7,0,0], output first element 0. Third input's first part [0,0,0], output first element 0. Fourth input's first part [0,0,0], output first element 0.\n\nIn Example 1's first input first part [7,7,0], output first element 0. Second input's first part [0,0,0], output first element 3. Wait, but earlier I thought that for first part being all zeros, output would be 3. But in Example 0's third input's first part is all zeros, but output is 0. So this contradicts.\n\nWait, Example 1's second input has first part [0,0,0], output first element 3. So why is it 3 in this case, but in Example 0's third input, first part is zeros but output is 0.\n\nThis is confusing. Let me re-examine those examples.\n\nExample 0's third input:\n\nInput: [0, 0, 0, 1, 5, 0, 5]\n\nOutput: [0, 3, 0]\n\nSo first part is [0,0,0], output first element 0.\n\nExample 1's second input:\n\nInput: [0,0,0,1,0,0,0]\n\nOutput: [3,3,3]\n\nFirst part [0,0,0] \u2192 output 3.\n\nSo why is it different? There must be another factor.\n\nWait, in Example 0's third input, the third part is [0,5], which according to previous thought would make the third output element 0. Which it does. But the first part is all zeros, but output is 0. Whereas in Example 1's second input, first part is zeros and output is 3. So what's the difference between these two cases?\n\nAh! Maybe the presence of 7s in the entire array affects the output. Let's check:\n\nIn Example 0's third input, the input array has no 7s. So first part is zeros. But output first element is 0.\n\nIn Example 1's second input, the input array is [0,0,0,1,0,0,0], which has no 7s. First part is zeros, output first element is 3.\n\nThis seems contradictory. So maybe there's another rule.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output's first element is 3 if the first part is all zeros and there are no 7s in the entire array. Wait, in Example 1's second input, there are no 7s. First part is zeros \u2192 output 3. In Example 0's third input, no 7s, first part zeros \u2192 output 0. So that's not it.\n\nHmm. Let's think about the entire array. Maybe the output is determined by multiple conditions across the entire array.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the first element of the output is 3 if the first part (positions 0-2) contains exactly two 7s. Let's check:\n\nExample 0's first input first part has two 7s \u2192 output 0. So not.\n\nAlternatively, the presence of any 7s in the first part. If there are any 7s, output first element 0. Otherwise, 3. Let's check:\n\nExample 0's first input first part has 7s \u2192 output 0. Example 1's second input first part has no 7s \u2192 output 3. Example 0's third input first part has no 7s \u2192 output 0. But here, it's zeros but output is 0, which contradicts.\n\nSo that's not it.\n\nAnother angle: let's look at the second element of the output. In Example 0's first input, second element is 0. Second input of Example 0, second element is 3. Third input's second element is 3. Fourth input's second element is 0.\n\nWhat's the second part of the input? The second part is [1,5]. But in Example 0's first input, the second part is [1,5], output second element 0. Second input's second part is [1,5], output second element 3. So it's varying. So the second output element isn't directly based on the second part.\n\nAlternatively, the second output element is based on the middle part of the input array, perhaps the presence of a 0 in the fifth position (index 4 is 5). Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the second output element is determined by the number of 5s in the third part. But in Example 0's first input, third part has no 5s, output second element is 0. Second input's third part has no 5s, output second element is 3. So that's not it.\n\nThis is really challenging. Let's try to think of another approach.\n\nPerhaps the output is based on the sum of the first three elements, middle two (1 and5), and last two. Let's compute sums for Example 0's first input:\n\nFirst part sum: 7+7+0=14\n\nSecond part: 1+5=6\n\nThird part: 0+0=0\n\nOutput is [0,0,3]. How does that relate? 14, 6, 0 \u2192 0,0,3. Not obvious.\n\nAnother idea: maybe the output elements are 3 if the sum of the part is divisible by 3. For example:\n\nFirst part sum 14: 14%3=2 \u2192 output 0.\n\nSecond part 6: 6%3=0 \u2192 output 0.\n\nThird part 0: 0%3=0 \u2192 output 3. But the output third element is 3 here. But the third part's sum is 0, which is divisible by 3. So perhaps for third part, sum divisible by 3 gives 3. But then in Example 0's second input, third part sum is 0 \u2192 divisible by 3 \u2192 output third element 3. That matches. But first part sum is 7+0+0=7 \u2192 7%3=1 \u2192 output first element 0. Second part sum 1+5=6 \u2192 divisible by 3 \u2192 output second element 3. Which matches the output [0,3,3].\n\nHmm, this could be a lead.\n\nLet's test this hypothesis:\n\nFor each part:\n\n- First part sum %3 ==0 \u2192 output first element 3, else 0.\n\n- Second part sum %3 ==0 \u2192 output second element 3, else 0.\n\n- Third part sum %3 ==0 \u2192 output third element 3, else 0.\n\nLet's check Example 0's first input:\n\nFirst part sum 14 \u2192 14%3=2 \u2192 0.\n\nSecond part sum 6 \u2192 6%3=0 \u2192 3. But output second element is 0. So this doesn't match. So hypothesis is incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for the second part, the sum of 1 and5 is always 6, which is divisible by 3. So why in some cases the second output element is 0. Like Example 0's first input, second part sum 6, output second element 0. So that's not it.\n\nAnother idea: Maybe for the first part, the sum modulo 3 is 0, but with some condition. Let's take Example 1's second input:\n\nFirst part sum 0+0+0=0 \u2192 0%3=0 \u2192 output first element 3. Which matches.\n\nSecond part sum 1+0=1 \u2192 1%3=1 \u2192 output second element 3. But in Example 1's second input, output is [3,3,3]. So according to this, second part sum 1 would be 1%3=1 \u2192 output 0, but actual output is 3. So this idea is incorrect.\n\nAnother possibility: The output is 3 if the sum of the part is a multiple of 5. Let's see:\n\nExample 0's first input third part sum 0 \u2192 0 is multiple of 5 \u2192 3. But first part sum 14 (not multiple of 5) \u2192 0. Second part sum 6 \u2192 not \u2192 output 0. Output is [0,0,3]. Which matches. Example 0's second input third part sum 0 \u2192 3. Second part sum 6 \u2192 6 not multiple of 5 \u2192 output second element 3. Hmm, no. 6 is not a multiple of 5, so output should be 0, but output is 3. So this idea is incorrect.\n\nHmm. Maybe the output is related to the presence of 5 in the third part. Let's check:\n\nFor the third part, if there's at least one 5, then output 3. But in Example 0's first input third part has no 5 \u2192 output 3. So that's not.\n\nAlternatively, if the third part contains exactly one 5, then 3. But in Example 4's first input, third part has one 5 \u2192 output 3. Example 0's fourth input third part has [5,0] \u2192 one 5 \u2192 output 3. Example 0's third input third part has [0,5] \u2192 one 5 \u2192 output 0. So no.\n\nWait, but if the third part is [5,0], output is 3. If it's [0,5], output is 0. So the order matters. So maybe the third part is [5, something] \u2192 3, [something else] \u2192 0. But how?\n\nIn Example 0's first input, third part is [0,0] \u2192 output 3. So that's a different case. So perhaps the third part is 3 if:\n\n- Both elements are 0, or\n\n- The first element is 5.\n\nSo if the third part starts with 5, or is all zeros.\n\nTesting this:\n\nExample 0's first input third part [0,0] \u2192 all zeros \u2192 3.\n\nExample 0's fourth input third part [5,0] \u2192 starts with 5 \u2192 3.\n\nExample 4's first input third part [5,0] \u2192 starts with 5 \u2192 3.\n\nExample 0's third input third part [0,5] \u2192 starts with 0 \u2192 0.\n\nExample 2's third input third part [5,5] \u2192 starts with 5 \u2192 output third element 3? Let's check Example 2's third input output: [0,0,3]. Third part is [5,5] \u2192 starts with 5. So output third element 3. Yes.\n\nExample 2's fourth input third part [0,0] \u2192 all zeros \u2192 output third element 0. Wait, no. Example 2's fourth input is [0,0,7,1,0,0,0]. Third part is [0,0] \u2192 output third element 0. Wait, but according to the rule, it should be 3. So that's a contradiction.\n\nExample 2's fourth input output is [3,3,0]. Third element is 0. So according to the rule, third part is [0,0], but output is 0. So this contradicts the hypothesis.\n\nHmm. Maybe I'm missing something. Let's check Example 2's fourth input:\n\nInput array: [0,0,7,1,0,0,0]. So third part is [0,0]. Output third element is 0. According to previous idea, it should be 3. So why isn't it?\n\nWait, maybe there's another condition. Maybe the third part's first element is 5 or the third part is all zeros, but the second part (indices 3-4) must have a 5. Let's see:\n\nIn Example 0's first input, second part is [1,5] (has 5), third part [0,0] \u2192 output third element 3.\n\nExample 0's fourth input second part [1,5], third part [5,0] \u2192 third element 3.\n\nExample 2's fourth input second part is [1,0] (no 5), third part [0,0] \u2192 output third element 0. Oh! So maybe the third part's rule only applies if the second part contains a 5. Let's test this:\n\nThe third part's output is 3 if:\n\n- The third part starts with 5 or is all zeros, AND the second part has a 5.\n\nOtherwise, output 0.\n\nLet's check:\n\nExample 0's first input:\n\nSecond part [1,5] \u2192 has 5. Third part [0,0] \u2192 output 3. Correct.\n\nExample 0's fourth input:\n\nSecond part [1,5] \u2192 has 5. Third part [5,0] \u2192 output 3. Correct.\n\nExample 2's fourth input:\n\nSecond part [1,0] \u2192 no 5. Third part [0,0] \u2192 output 0. Correct.\n\nExample 4's first input:\n\nSecond part [1,0] \u2192 no 5. Third part [5,0] \u2192 output third element 3. But according to this rule, since second part has no 5, output should be 0. But the actual output is 3. So this contradicts.\n\nHmm. This is getting too complicated. Maybe the third part's output is 3 if the third part is [0,0] or [5,0], and the second part is [1,5]. But in Example 4's first input, the second part is [1,0], which is not [1,5], but third part is [5,0] and output is 3. So that's not it.\n\nThis is really challenging. Let's try to look for another pattern. Perhaps the output elements are based on the number of times 7 appears before 1 and 5 appears after 1. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe each output element corresponds to the number of times a specific pattern occurs in the input array. For example, the first output element could be the number of 7-0 sequences in the first part, multiplied by 3. But in Example 0's first part [7,7,0], there is one 7 followed by 0. So output would be 1*3=3. But actual output is 0. So that's not it.\n\nAnother idea: The output elements might represent the presence of certain digits in specific positions. For instance:\n\n- First output element: 3 if there's a 7 in position 0.\n\n- Second output element: 3 if there's a 7 in position 1.\n\n- Third output element: 3 if there's a 5 in position 5.\n\nBut let's check:\n\nExample 0's first input: positions 0=7, 1=7, 5=0. So output [3,3,0]. But actual output is [0,0,3]. Doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output elements are determined by the number of 7s in the first three elements, the number of 0s in positions 3-4, and the number of 5s in the last two. But this seems too vague.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each output element is 3 if the corresponding part has an odd number of non-zero elements. \n\nExample 0's first input first part has 2 non-zero (7,7) \u2192 even \u2192 0. Output first element 0. Second part has 2 non-zero \u2192 even \u2192 0. Output second element 0. Third part has 0 non-zero \u2192 even \u2192 0. But output third element 3. So doesn't fit.\n\nAnother approach: Look at the outputs and see if they can be derived from the input array's indices. For example:\n\nIn Example 0's first output [0,0,3], perhaps the 3 is because there are two zeros in the third part (positions 5-6), but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each output element is 3 if the sum of the part is equal to the number of elements multiplied by 3. For example, third part has two elements: sum 0. 0 = 2*0 \u2192 but 3 is output. Not matching.\n\nAnother possible lead: Let's look at the number of 7s in the entire input array. For Example 0's first input, there are two 7s. Output's first element is 0. Example 1's second input has no 7s, output's first element is 3. Example 0's third input has no 7s, output's first element is 0. So maybe the first output element is 3 only if there are no 7s in the entire array. But Example 0's third input has no 7s but output first element is 0. So that's not it.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the first output element is 3 if there are no 7s in the first part and no 7s in the entire array. But this is getting too convoluted.\n\nPerhaps I should focus on the third element first, since it seems to have a clearer pattern. From earlier examples, the third element is 3 if the third part is [0,0] or [5,0]. But there are exceptions. For example, Example 4's first input third part is [5,0], output is 3. Example 0's fourth input third part [5,0] \u2192 output 3. Example 0's third input third part [0,5] \u2192 output 0. Example 2's first input third part [0,0] \u2192 output 0. Wait, Example 2's first input third part [0,0] output third element is 0. So this contradicts the earlier pattern.\n\nSo why is that?\n\nExample 2's first input is [0,7,7,1,5,0,0]. Output is [0,0,0]. Third part is [0,0]. But output third element is 0. So according to previous idea, it should be 3, but it's 0. So there must be another factor.\n\nWait, perhaps the third part's output is 3 only if the third part is [0,0] and the first part has at least one 7. Let's check:\n\nExample 0's first input third part [0,0], first part has 7s \u2192 output third element 3.\n\nExample 2's first input third part [0,0], first part has 7s \u2192 output third element 0. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the third part's output depends on the entire array's structure. For example, if there are any 5s after the third part. Not sure.\n\nThis is taking too long. Let me try to summarize what I think might be the pattern for each output element:\n\nAfter analyzing several examples, it seems that the third output element is 3 if the third part (positions 5-6) is [0,0] or [5,0], and the second part (positions 3-4) is [1,5]. However, there are exceptions, such as Example 4's first input where the second part is [1,0], but the third element is 3. So that's not.\n\nAlternatively, the third output element is 3 if the third part is [0,0] or ends with a 0. Let's check:\n\nExample 0's first input third part [0,0] \u2192 ends with 0 \u2192 3.\n\nExample 0's fourth input third part [5,0] \u2192 ends with 0 \u2192 3.\n\nExample 4's first input third part [5,0] \u2192 ends with 0 \u2192 3.\n\nExample 0's third input third part [0,5] \u2192 ends with 5 \u2192 0.\n\nExample 2's first input third part [0,0] \u2192 ends with 0 \u2192 output 0. But this contradicts.\n\nHmm. But Example 2's first input's third part ends with 0 but output is 0. So this hypothesis is incorrect.\n\nAnother angle: Maybe the third output element is 3 if the third part contains exactly one 0. \n\nExample 0's first input third part has two 0s \u2192 output 3. So that's not.\n\nAlternatively, exactly two 0s \u2192 output 3. But in Example 0's fourth input third part [5,0] has one 0 \u2192 output 3. So no.\n\nI'm stuck. Let's try to think of another approach. Maybe the output is generated by a different kind of transformation. For example, each output array corresponds to a certain position's change between the four input arrays. Since each example has four input arrays and four output arrays. But that seems unlikely, as the examples have varying numbers of input arrays. Wait, looking back, each example's input is four arrays. Each output is four arrays. So each of the four output arrays corresponds to each of the four input arrays. So for each input array in the example, there's a corresponding output array. So the transformation is per input array, not across them.\n\nSo each input array is transformed into an output array of three elements.\n\nSo maybe each output array is generated from its corresponding input array through some rules applied to the input array's elements.\n\nLet me look at one input array and its output.\n\nTake Example 0's first input array: [7,7,0,1,5,0,0] \u2192 output [0,0,3].\n\nThe output has three elements. Let's think about each element:\n\n- The first element: 0\n\n- The second: 0\n\n- The third:3.\n\nLooking at the input array, what could each output element represent?\n\nMaybe the first element is related to the first three elements (positions 0-2), the second to positions 3-4 (1 and 5), and the third to positions 5-6.\n\nSo, for the first element, perhaps it's 3 if the first three elements are all zeros, else 0. But in Example 0's first input, first three elements are 7,7,0 \u2192 output first element 0. In Example 1's second input, first three are zeros \u2192 output first element 3. So that's possible. But in Example 0's third input, first three are zeros \u2192 output first element 0. So why the discrepancy?\n\nAh! Wait, the output first element is 3 only if the first three elements are all zeros and there are no 7s in the entire array. Let's check:\n\nExample 0's third input array is [0,0,0,1,5,0,5]. The entire array has no 7s. First three are zeros. Output first element is 0. But according to this rule, it should be 3. So no.\n\nAnother possibility: the first element is 3 if the first three elements contain exactly two 7s. Example 0's first input has two 7s \u2192 output 0. So not.\n\nAlternatively, first element is 3 if the first three elements contain a 7 followed by a 0. Example 0's first input first three are [7,7,0] \u2192 no 7 followed by 0 (it's 7\u21927\u21920). So one instance of 7 followed by 0. Output first element 0. So that's not it.\n\nAnother idea: the first element is 3 if there are no 7s in the entire array. But Example 0's third input has no 7s \u2192 output first element 0. Example 1's second input has no 7s \u2192 output first element 3. So why the difference?\n\nWait, maybe the presence of a 5 in the third part affects the first element. Example 0's third input has a 5 in the third part, but Example 1's second input's third part has no 5. So if first part is all zeros and there are no 7s and third part has no 5 \u2192 first element 3. Example 0's third input has third part with 5 \u2192 first element 0. But this is speculative.\n\nAlternatively, the first output element is 3 if the first three elements are all zeros and the entire array contains no 7s or 5s. But Example 1's second input has 1 and 0s, no 7s or 5s (except the fixed 1 and5 in positions 3 and4). Wait, no, in Example 1's second input, the array is [0,0,0,1,0,0,0]. So position 4 is 0, not 5. So the second part is [1,0], not [1,5]. So maybe the output rules depend on whether the second part is [1,5] or not.\n\nSo maybe the first output element is 3 if:\n\n- The first three elements are all zeros, AND the second part is [1,5], AND there are no 7s in the array.\n\nBut in Example 1's second input, the second part is [1,0], so output first element is 3. So that's not.\n\nThis is extremely challenging. Let's try to look for any other patterns. For example, maybe each output element corresponds to the number of times a certain number appears in specific positions.\n\nAlternatively, think of the output elements as binary flags (0 or 3) representing certain conditions. For example:\n\nFirst element: 3 if the first part (positions 0-2) contains a 7 and a 0.\n\nSecond element: 3 if the second part (positions 3-4) is [1,5].\n\nThird element: 3 if the third part (positions 5-6) has at least one 5.\n\nWait:\n\nExample 0's first input:\n\nFirst part has 7,7,0 \u2192 contains a 7 and 0 \u2192 3. But output first element is 0. So no.\n\nExample 1's second input:\n\nFirst part is zeros \u2192 no 7 and 0 \u2192 output first element 3. So that's not.\n\nAlternatively, first element is 3 if the first part has no 7s. Example 1's second input first part has no 7s \u2192 output 3. Example 0's third input first part has no 7s \u2192 output 0. So that's not.\n\nAnother idea: Maybe the output elements are determined by the presence of a 7 in the corresponding part. For example:\n\nFirst element: 3 if no 7s in the first part.\n\nSecond element: 3 if no 7s in the second part.\n\nThird element: 3 if no 7s in the third part.\n\nBut in Example 0's first input:\n\nFirst part has 7s \u2192 output 0.\n\nSecond part no 7s \u2192 output 0 (but second part is [1,5], no 7s, but output is 0).\n\nThird part no 7s \u2192 output 3. So this fits for the third part. But not for the second.\n\nThis is getting me nowhere. I think I need to look for another approach.\n\nLet me look at the test input and try to see if I can apply any observed patterns.\n\nTest Input:\n\n[0,0,0,1,0,5,0]\n\n[7,7,7,1,5,5,0]\n\n[0,0,0,1,5,0,0]\n\n[7,0,0,1,5,5,5]\n\nEach of these four arrays needs to be transformed into an output array of three elements.\n\nLet's take the first test array: [0,0,0,1,0,5,0].\n\nSplit into parts:\n\nFirst part: [0,0,0]\n\nSecond part: [1,0]\n\nThird part: [5,0]\n\nPossible third element: if third part is [5,0], then output third element is 3. As seen in previous examples like Example 0's fourth input. So third element would be 3.\n\nFirst part: [0,0,0]. In Example 1's second input, first part is zeros and output first element is 3. But in Example 0's third input, first part is zeros and output is 0. What's the difference? In Example 1's second input, the second part is [1,0], while in Example 0's third input, the second part is [1,5]. So perhaps the first output element is 3 if the first part is all zeros and the second part is not [1,5].\n\nIn the first test array, the second part is [1,0], not [1,5]. So first output element would be 3. Second part is [1,0], so output second element would be 3 if some condition. In Example 1's second input, second part is [1,0], output second element is 3. So perhaps if the second part is [1,0], output second element is 3. Otherwise, if it's [1,5], output 0. But in Example 0's first input, second part is [1,5], output second element is 0. In Example 0's second input, second part is [1,5], output second element is 3. So that contradicts.\n\nAlternatively, the second output element is 3 if the second part has a 0. In Example 1's second input, second part [1,0] \u2192 3. Test array's first input's second part [1,0] \u2192 output second element 3.\n\nThird output element is 3 as per third part [5,0].\n\nSo first test array output would be [3,3,3]. But let's check if any example has this output. For example, Example 1's second input has output [3,3,3]. So that's possible.\n\nNow, second test array: [7,7,7,1,5,5,0].\n\nSplit into parts:\n\nFirst: [7,7,7]\n\nSecond: [1,5]\n\nThird: [5,0]\n\nFirst part has 7s \u2192 output first element 0.\n\nSecond part is [1,5] \u2192 in Example 0's first input, this gives output second element 0. But in Example 0's second input, second part [1,5] gives output second element 3. So not sure. If the third part is [5,0], third element is 3.\n\nSo second test array's output could be [0,0,3], but not sure.\n\nThird test array: [0,0,0,1,5,0,0].\n\nSplit into parts:\n\nFirst: [0,0,0]\n\nSecond: [1,5]\n\nThird: [0,0]\n\nFirst part: zeros. In Example 0's third input, first part zeros but output first element 0. So maybe if the second part is [1,5], first element is 0. So here, since second part is [1,5], output first element 0.\n\nSecond part is [1,5]. In Example 0's first input, output second element 0. But in Example 0's second input, output second element 3. So I'm not certain. Third part is [0,0], which in Example 0's first input gives third element 3. So third element 3.\n\nSo output could be [0,0,3].\n\nFourth test array: [7,0,0,1,5,5,5].\n\nSplit into parts:\n\nFirst: [7,0,0]\n\nSecond: [1,5]\n\nThird: [5,5]\n\nFirst part has a 7 \u2192 output first element 0.\n\nSecond part [1,5]. Output second element could be 0 or 3. In Example 0's fourth input, third part is [5,0], output third element 3. But in this case, third part is [5,5]. Example 0's fourth input's third part is [5,0], output third element 3. But in Example 2's third input, third part is [5,5], output third element 3. So if third part starts with 5, output 3. But here, third part is [5,5], so output third element 3. But wait, in Example 2's third input, third part [5,5] \u2192 output third element 3. So fourth test array's third part would give 3. So output is [0, ?, 3]. For the second element, if second part is [1,5], sometimes output is 0 or 3. In Example 0's first input, output second element is 0. In Example 0's second input, output second element is 3. Why?\n\nMaybe the second output element is 3 if the third part has a 5. But in Example 0's first input, third part has no 5 \u2192 output second element 0. In Example 0's second input, third part has no 5 \u2192 output second element 3. So that's not.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the second output element is 3 if the sum of the second part and third part is even. But this is just a guess.\n\nThis is really tough. Based on the examples, I'll try to make some guesses for the test input.\n\nTest input:\n\nFirst array: [0,0,0,1,0,5,0]. Output likely [3,3,3].\n\nSecond array: [7,7,7,1,5,5,0]. Output [0,0,3].\n\nThird array: [0,0,0,1,5,0,0]. Output [0,0,3].\n\nFourth array: [7,0,0,1,5,5,5]. Output [0,0,0].\n\nBut looking at Example 4's first input, third part [5,0] outputs 3. So fourth array's third part is [5,5], which may output 3 if the third part starts with 5, regardless of the rest. So maybe fourth array's third element is 3. But in Example 2's third input, third part [5,5] outputs third element 3.\n\nBut according to Example 4's fourth input, third part is [5,5,5], but output third element is 0. Wait, Example 4's fourth input third part is [5,5,5]? No, the input is [7,7,7,1,5,5,5]. Third part is [5,5]. Output is [0,0,0]. So why? This contradicts the earlier idea.\n\nHmm. In Example 4's fourth input, third part is [5,5]. Output third element is 0. So if the third part is [5,5], output 0. But in Example 2's third input, third part [5,5] outputs 3. So that's inconsistent.\n\nThis is really challenging. Given the time I've spent and not finding a clear pattern, I'll have to make an educated guess based on the parts:\n\nFor each array:\n\nFirst output element is 3 if the first part is all zeros and the second part is not [1,5].\n\nSecond output element is 3 if the second part is not [1,5].\n\nThird output element is 3 if the third part is [0,0] or [5,0].\n\nApplying this to the test input:\n\nFirst array:\n\nFirst part [0,0,0], second part [1,0] \u2192 output [3,3,3].\n\nSecond array:\n\nFirst part [7,7,7], second part [1,5] \u2192 output [0,0,3].\n\nThird array:\n\nFirst part [0,0,0], second part [1,5] \u2192 output [0,0,3].\n\nFourth array:\n\nFirst part [7,0,0], second part [1,5] \u2192 output [0,0,0] (third part [5,5] \u2192 no).\n\nBut according to this, the fourth array's third part is [5,5], so third element 0.\n\nBut in Example 2's third input, third part [5,5] outputs 3. So this is inconsistent.\n\nGiven the confusion, perhaps the correct output for the test input is:\n\n[3,3,3]\n\n[0,0,3]\n\n[0,0,3]\n\n[0,0,0]\n\nBut looking at the examples, Example 4's fourth input has third part [5,5] \u2192 output third element 0. So this aligns with the fourth test array's third part [5,5], output 0.\n\nSo the final answer would be:\n\n[3,3,3]\n\n[0,0,3]\n\n[0,0,3]\n\n[0,0,0]\n\nBut looking back at the training examples, the output arrays don't have [3,3,3] except in Example 1's second input. So maybe that's correct.\n\nBut I'm not sure. Given the time I've spent, I'll go with this."
