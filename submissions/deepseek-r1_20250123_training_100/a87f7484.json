        "cot_1": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. So, looking at the training examples, each input has several rows of numbers, and the output is a subset of those rows. The key is to determine what criteria the output rows meet.\n\nStarting with Example 0. The input has a bunch of rows, and the output is the three rows with 8s. Let me check the original input. The first three rows are [6,0,6], [0,6,6], [6,0,6], then [4,0,4] etc., and the output is the three 8s. Hmm. Wait, the 8s are in the rows [8,8,8], [8,0,8], [8,8,8]. So maybe the pattern is that the output rows are the ones that form a symmetrical pattern or perhaps the rows that have the highest number in the entire input?\n\nIn Example 0, 8 is the highest number. Similarly, in Example 1, the output is rows with 7s, which is the highest number in the input. Example 2's output is rows with 4s, which is the highest in that input. Example 3's output has 7s again, which seems to be the highest in that input. So maybe the pattern is selecting the group of rows that contain the maximum value in the entire input.\n\nBut wait, in Example 3, the input includes 8s as well. Let me check. The input in Example 3 has rows with 7,3,2,8. Oh wait, the test input has [8,0,0], [0,8,8], [8,0,0] towards the end. But the output is the first three rows with 7s. So that contradicts the idea that the highest number is selected. Because 8 is higher than 7, but in Example 3, the output is the 7s. So maybe there's another pattern.\n\nHmm. Let me re-examine Example 3. The input includes several groups:\n\nFirst group:\n[0,7,7]\n[7,7,0]\n[7,0,7]\n\nThen groups for 3, 2, 8. But the output is the first group (7s). So why 7 and not 8? Maybe the group that is repeated three times? Let's see. The 7 group has three rows, the 3 group has three rows, same with 2 and 8. Wait, in the input of Example3, each number (7,3,2,8) has three rows each. But the output is the first group. Maybe the group with the highest number that appears first? But 8 comes after 7, so that doesn't fit. So that's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the group that has a certain structure. Looking at the output of Example0, the selected rows are [8,8,8], [8,0,8], [8,8,8]. That's a pattern where the middle row has a 0 in the middle. Similarly, in Example1, the output is [7,0,7], [0,7,0], [7,0,7], which is similar. The pattern here might be that the group forms a kind of diamond or cross shape with 0 in the center. For example, the first and third row have the same elements, and the middle row has the element in the middle as 0.\n\nWait, let's check Example0's output:\n\n[8,8,8]\n[8,0,8]\n[8,8,8]\n\nYes, the middle element of the middle row is 0. Similarly, Example1's output has [7,0,7], [0,7,0], [7,0,7]. Each row has the same pattern. The middle element is 0 in the middle row, and the surrounding rows have 0s at the ends? Not exactly. Let me see:\n\nIn Example1's output:\n\nFirst row:7,0,7 (middle is 0)\nSecond row:0,7,0 (middle is 7)\nThird row:7,0,7 (same as first)\n\nWait, that's a different pattern. Hmm. Maybe the key is that the group of three rows has a symmetry where the first and third rows are the same, and the middle row is a variation with a 0. But how does that relate to the selection?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is the first occurrence of a group where each row in the group has exactly two instances of the same number and one 0. For example, in Example0's output, each row has two 8s and a 0 (except the first and third which are all 8s, but wait no, first and third are all 8s. Hmm, that doesn't fit.\n\nWait, let's look for another pattern. Let's see the outputs:\n\nEach output consists of three rows. The numbers in these rows are the same across the three rows, except for 0s in certain positions. For example, in Example0, the three rows are 8s except the middle row has a 0 in the middle. In Example1, each row has 7 and 0s arranged in a pattern. So maybe the group that has a specific arrangement of numbers forming a sort of diamond or cross.\n\nAnother angle: Looking at the training examples, the output is the group (three consecutive rows) where the numbers form a certain pattern. For instance, in Example0, the group starts at row 6 (0-indexed?), but the input has 9 rows. Let's count:\n\nOriginal input for Example0:\n\n[6,0,6]\n[0,6,6]\n[6,0,6]\n[4,0,4]\n[0,4,4]\n[4,0,4]\n[8,8,8]\n[8,0,8]\n[8,8,8]\n\nThe output is the last three rows. The numbers here are all 8s. So perhaps the group with the highest number. But in Example3, the output is the first group with 7s, even though there's a group with 8s later. That contradicts that idea.\n\nWait, in Example3's input:\n\nThe input includes groups for 7,3,2,8. The output is the 7 group. So why is that? The 8 group is present. So the highest number isn't the key here. So maybe there's another pattern.\n\nLooking at the structure of the groups. For Example3, the 7 group is:\n\n[0,7,7]\n[7,7,0]\n[7,0,7]\n\nEach of these rows has two 7s and one 0. The 8 group in the input is:\n\n[8,0,0]\n[0,8,8]\n[8,0,0]\n\nEach row has two 8s and a 0. So maybe the pattern is that the group which has exactly two instances of the same number in each row, with a 0. But how to choose between groups?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the group where the sum of the numbers in each row is the same. Let's check:\n\nIn Example0's output, each row in the group:\n\n[8,8,8] sum is 24\n[8,0,8] sum is 16\n[8,8,8] sum is 24. So no, sums vary.\n\nIn Example1's output:\n\n[7,0,7] sum 14\n[0,7,0] sum 7\n[7,0,7] sum 14. So sums vary again.\n\nSo that's not it.\n\nAnother approach: looking at the positions of the numbers. For example, in the output groups, the middle element is 0 in certain rows. Maybe the group has a symmetry where the middle row has a 0 in the middle, and the other rows have 0s elsewhere. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the group that forms a palindrome in each row. Let's check:\n\nExample0's output rows:\n\n[8,8,8] is a palindrome.\n[8,0,8] is a palindrome.\n[8,8,8] is a palindrome. So yes.\n\nExample1's output rows:\n\n[7,0,7] is a palindrome.\n[0,7,0] is a palindrome.\n[7,0,7] is a palindrome. Yes.\n\nExample2's output:\n\n[4,0,4] palindrome.\n[4,4,4] palindrome.\n[4,0,4] palindrome. Yes.\n\nExample3's output:\n\n[0,7,7] reversed is [7,7,0], which is the second row. The third row is [7,0,7], which is a palindrome. So perhaps the group consists of three rows where each row is either a palindrome or part of a rotational pattern.\n\nWait, in Example3's output:\n\nFirst row: [0,7,7]\nSecond: [7,7,0]\nThird: [7,0,7]\n\nIf you rotate the first row, you might get the second row. For example, shifting elements. Let's see: rotating [0,7,7] to the right once would give [7,0,7], but that's the third row. Hmm. Alternatively, the first row is mirrored to become the second row. For example, [0,7,7] reversed is [7,7,0], which is the second row. Then the third row is a palindrome.\n\nSo the group is structured such that the first and second rows are reverses of each other, and the third row is a palindrome. Then the entire group forms a specific pattern.\n\nBut how does that help in selecting which group to choose?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the group is the first one in the input that has all three rows containing exactly two instances of the same number and one zero. But in Example0's output, the first and third rows are all 8s (three instances) except the middle row. Wait, [8,8,8] has three 8s. So that breaks that idea.\n\nAlternatively, the group is the first one where the middle row has a zero in the middle. Let's check:\n\nExample0's output middle row is [8,0,8] \u2014 yes, zero in the middle.\n\nExample1's output middle row is [0,7,0] \u2014 zero in the middle.\n\nExample2's output middle row is [4,4,4] \u2014 no zero. Wait, but that's not. Wait, Example2's output is:\n\n[4,0,4]\n[4,4,4]\n[4,0,4]\n\nThe middle row is [4,4,4], which has no zeros. So that contradicts the previous idea.\n\nHmm. Maybe I need to look for another pattern.\n\nLet me consider the numbers in the groups. For each training example's output, the group's number (e.g., 8,7,4,7) is the maximum in their respective inputs. But in Example3, the input has an 8, which is higher than 7, but the output is 7. So that can't be. So that approach is wrong.\n\nWait, let's check Example3's input again. The input is:\n\n[0,7,7]\n[7,7,0]\n[7,0,7]\n[3,0,0]\n[0,3,3]\n[3,0,0]\n[2,0,0]\n[0,2,2]\n[2,0,0]\n[8,0,0]\n[0,8,8]\n[8,0,0]\n\nSo there are groups for 7,3,2,8. The output is the first group (7s). The 8 group comes after. But why isn't the 8 group selected?\n\nMaybe the pattern is that the output is the first group where all three rows contain the same number (but not necessarily all elements). For example, in Example0, the group for 8 has three rows where all elements are 8 except for one in the middle row. But that's not the case. The first and third rows are all 8s. The middle row has two 8s and a 0.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the group is the first one where each row in the group contains the same number, possibly with zeros. For instance, in Example0's output group, the number is 8. All elements in each row are either 8 or 0. Similarly, Example1's group is all 7s and 0s. Example2's group is 4s and 0s. Example3's group is 7s and 0s. So the pattern might be to select the first group where all rows in the group consist of a single non-zero number and zeros, and the non-zero number is the same across the group.\n\nWait, but in Example0's output, the first and third rows are all 8s. So in those rows, there are no zeros, but the group is selected. So that might not fit.\n\nAlternatively, the group must have exactly two non-zero elements in each row. Let's check:\n\nExample0's output rows:\n\n[8,8,8] \u2192 three 8s. So that's three non-zero elements. So that doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. Another approach: Let's look at the number of groups. Each input has multiple groups, each consisting of three rows. For example, in Example0, there are groups for 6, 4, 8. Each group is three rows. The output is the last group (8s). But in Example3, the output is the first group (7s) even though there are higher numbers. So the selection isn't based on the numerical value.\n\nLooking at Example1: the input has groups with numbers 2,3,7,1. The output is the 7 group. Which is the highest number here. So that fits. Example2's output is the 4 group, which is the highest in that input. Example3's input has 7,3,2,8. But output is 7s. So why not 8? This breaks the pattern. So maybe there's another criterion.\n\nWait, maybe the group that is the first to have three rows with the same non-zero number. Let's see:\n\nIn Example0, the 8 group's first row is [8,8,8], all same. Then the middle row has a 0. But the group is selected. Maybe the presence of a row with all same numbers. For instance, in Example0's output, the first and third rows are all 8s. The middle row has a 0. So perhaps the group must have at least one row with all elements the same (non-zero) and others following a certain pattern.\n\nAlternatively, the group that contains the most instances of the same number. For example, the 8 group in Example0 has three rows with 8s, some of which are all 8s. But how does that compare to other groups?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the group where the first and third rows are the same, and the middle row has a 0 in the middle. Let's check:\n\nExample0's output:\n\nFirst and third rows are [8,8,8], same. Middle row [8,0,8], middle is 0.\n\nExample1's output:\n\nFirst and third rows [7,0,7], same. Middle row [0,7,0], which has 0s at the ends.\n\nExample2's output:\n\nFirst and third rows [4,0,4], same. Middle row [4,4,4].\n\nExample3's output:\n\nFirst row [0,7,7], third row [7,0,7]. Not the same. Hmm, so that's different.\n\nSo this pattern holds for Examples0,1,2 but not 3. So maybe there's another aspect.\n\nWait Example3's output group has rows:\n\n[0,7,7]\n[7,7,0]\n[7,0,7]\n\nNotice that each row has two 7s and one 0, arranged in a way that each position (first, second, third) has a 0 once across the three rows. The first row has 0 in the first position, second row in the third, third row in the second. Also, each row is a rotation or permutation of the others. Maybe the group forms a set where each row has the same elements but arranged differently, with exactly two instances of the number and one zero.\n\nSo for a group to be selected, it must have three rows where each row contains exactly two instances of a number and one zero, arranged in all possible permutations where the zero is in each position once. For example:\n\nRow1: 0, X, X\n\nRow2: X, X, 0\n\nRow3: X, 0, X\n\nBut then the number X is the same across all three rows. For example, in Example3's output, the number is 7. Each row has two 7s and a 0 in different positions. Similarly, in Example0, the group has 8s. The first and third rows are all 8s, which breaks this pattern. Hmm, so maybe not.\n\nWait, Example0's group is different. The first and third rows are all 8s, no zeros. The middle row has two 8s and a 0. So that's not three permutations of two 8s and a 0. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAnother possibility: the output group is the first one where all three rows have the same number, but with some zeros. But how to determine which group.\n\nAlternatively, let's count the number of times the number appears in the group. For instance, in Example0's output group, there are three rows. The first and third have three 8s each (total 6), and the middle row has two 8s. Total 8s: 6 + 2 = 8. Not sure if that's relevant.\n\nAlternatively, the group that has the maximum sum of numbers. For Example0's output group sum: 8*3 + 8*3 + 8*3 (except middle row is 8+0+8=16) \u2192 total sum for the group is 24 +16 +24=64. Other groups: the 6 group's sum might be lower. So maybe the group with the highest total sum. But in Example3, the 7 group sum would be (0+7+7) + (7+7+0) + (7+0+7) =14 +14 +14=42. The 8 group would be (8+0+0) + (0+8+8) + (8+0+0) =8 +16 +8=32. So 42 is higher, so the 7 group is selected. So maybe the group with the highest sum. Let's check other examples.\n\nExample1's input: The output is the 7 group. Let's compute the sum of that group. Each row in the output is:\n\n[7,0,7] \u2192 sum 14\n\n[0,7,0] \u2192 sum 7\n\n[7,0,7] \u2192 sum 14\n\nTotal sum: 14+7+14=35. Are there other groups in Example1's input with higher sum? The input is:\n\nOriginal input for Example1:\n\n[2, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 7, 0, 7, 1, 0, 0] \u2192 length 12? Or maybe each row is a list. Wait, the input is:\n\nRow1: [2,0,0,3,0,0,7,0,7,1,0,0]\n\nRow2: [2,0,0,3,0,0,0,7,0,1,0,0]\n\nRow3: [0,2,2,0,3,3,7,0,7,0,1,1]\n\nBut this might be a typo. Wait, looking back, the input for Example1 is three rows of lists. Wait, in the training examples, each example's input is a list of rows, each row is a list. For example, Example0's input is nine rows of 3 elements each. Example1's input is three rows with longer lists. Then the output is three rows. So perhaps the pattern is that the output is a 3-row group where each row is a triplet (three elements) taken from the input. But how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each input is a sequence of numbers arranged in rows, and the output is a group of three consecutive rows that form a certain pattern. For instance, in Example0, the input has nine rows. The output is the last three. How do they relate to the other groups?\n\nBut this seems too vague. Let's try to find another pattern.\n\nAnother approach: For each output group, the non-zero number is the one that appears in all three rows. For example, in Example0's output, all rows have 8s. In Example1, all rows have 7s. Example2 has 4s, and Example3 has 7s. So the group is three consecutive rows where the same non-zero number appears in each row, possibly along with zeros. But how to determine which group to pick.\n\nBut in Example0's output, the first and third rows are all 8s. The middle row has 8s and a 0. So all rows include 8s. In Example3's output, all rows include 7s. So maybe the group is the first group where all three rows contain the same non-zero number, regardless of zeros.\n\nBut how to determine which group that is. For example, in Example3's input, the first three rows are 7s, then the next three are 3s, etc. So the first group with all three rows containing the same number (7) would be selected. But in Example3's input, the first three rows are [0,7,7], [7,7,0], [7,0,7]. All contain 7s. The next group is 3s: [3,0,0], [0,3,3], [3,0,0]. All contain 3s. Similarly for 2 and 8. So why is the 7 group selected? Because it's the first such group. The output is the first group where each row contains the same number (7 in this case) along with zeros.\n\nBut in Example0's input, the first group is 6s, but the output is the 8s group. So that contradicts this idea. Because the first group would be 6s. So why isn't that the output?\n\nWait, Example0's input is:\n\n[6,0,6]\n[0,6,6]\n[6,0,6]\n[4,0,4]\n[0,4,4]\n[4,0,4]\n[8,8,8]\n[8,0,8]\n[8,8,8]\n\nThe groups are:\n\nGroup 0: 6s (three rows)\nGroup 1: 4s (three rows)\nGroup 2: 8s (three rows)\n\nOutput is group 2 (8s). So according to this theory, the output should be the first group, but it's not. So this pattern doesn't hold.\n\nAlternative idea: The output is the group where the number appears in all three rows and is the highest such number in the input. For Example0, 8 is higher than 6 and 4, so selected. Example1, 7 is the highest. Example2, 4 is the highest. Example3, the highest number is 8, but the output is 7s. So this theory fails.\n\nWait, but in Example3's input, the 8 group's rows are [8,0,0], [0,8,8], [8,0,0]. All rows contain 8s. So why isn't this group selected? Because the output is the 7s group. This breaks the previous pattern.\n\nThis suggests that there's another factor. Maybe the group must not only contain the same number but also have a specific arrangement. For example, the group must form a certain shape or pattern. For instance, the 7s group in Example3 has each row as a permutation of two 7s and one 0. The 8s group has two 8s and one 0 in each row, but arranged in a different way. Maybe the pattern is that the group must have all possible positions of the zero in the triplet. For example, in the 7s group:\n\nRow1: 0 at position 0 (0-based)\nRow2: 0 at position 2\nRow3: 0 at position 1\n\nSo all three positions have a zero once. But in the 8s group:\n\nRow1: 0 at position 1 and 2 (no, row is [8,0,0], zeros at 1 and 2)\nRow2: zeros at 0 and 2?\nWait, no. [0,8,8] has zero at position 0.\nRow3: [8,0,0], zeros at positions 1 and 2.\n\nSo the 8s group's rows have zeros in positions 0, 1, and 2, but not each once per row. So maybe the group must have each row with a single zero in a different position. The 7s group does that, but the 8s group doesn't. So this could be the pattern.\n\nIn Example0's output group:\n\nRows are [8,8,8], [8,0,8], [8,8,8]. The middle row has zero at position 1, the others have no zeros. So this doesn't fit. Hmm.\n\nIn Example1's output group:\n\nRows are [7,0,7], [0,7,0], [7,0,7]. The zeros are in positions 1, 0 and 2, and 1. So the middle row has zero in position 1, but others have zeros in position 0 and 2. So each row has one zero in different positions. First and third row have zero in position 1, middle row in positions 0 and 2. Wait, no. Let me check:\n\nFirst row [7,0,7] \u2192 zero at position 1.\n\nSecond row [0,7,0] \u2192 zeros at positions 0 and 2.\n\nThird row [7,0,7] \u2192 zero at position 1.\n\nSo the zeros are in position 1 in first and third rows, and in 0 and 2 in the middle. So that's not covering all three positions.\n\nExample2's output group:\n\nRows are [4,0,4], [4,4,4], [4,0,4]. The zeros are in position 1 in the first and third rows. The middle row has no zeros. So this doesn't fit the pattern.\n\nSo this theory isn't holding.\n\nPerhaps the pattern is that the output is the group that forms a \"hollow\" square or some other structure. For example, in Example0's output, the first and third rows are all 8s, and the middle row has a zero in the middle. Like a frame.\n\nExample1's output has a cross shape: 7s in the middle with zeros around.\n\nExample2's output has a different structure. The middle row is all 4s, the others have 4s and a zero in the middle.\n\nExample3's output has the three rows each with two 7s and a zero in different positions.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Maybe another angle: looking for the number that appears in all three rows of the output group. For example, in Example3's output group, 7 is present in all three rows. In the 8 group, 8 is present in all rows. But why select 7 over 8?\n\nLooking back at Example3's input:\n\nThe groups are in the order 7, 3, 2, 8. The output is the first group (7s), even though there's a later group with 8s. So maybe the output is the first group where the non-zero number appears in all three rows of the group, and that number is the highest such possible among all groups that meet this condition.\n\nWait, but in Example3's input, the 8 group also has all three rows containing 8s. So why isn't it selected?\n\nThis is confusing. Let me recheck Example3's input:\n\nThe input for Example3 is:\n\n[0,7,7]\n[7,7,0]\n[7,0,7]\n[3,0,0]\n[0,3,3]\n[3,0,0]\n[2,0,0]\n[0,2,2]\n[2,0,0]\n[8,0,0]\n[0,8,8]\n[8,0,0]\n\nEach group is three consecutive rows. The first group is 7s, then 3s, then 2s, then 8s. The output is the first group (7s). But why?\n\nPerhaps the pattern is to select the group where each row contains exactly two instances of the number and one zero, and this is the first such group. Let's check:\n\nFirst group (7s):\n\n[0,7,7] \u2192 two 7s and one 0 \u2192 yes.\n\n[7,7,0] \u2192 two 7s and one 0 \u2192 yes.\n\n[7,0,7] \u2192 two 7s and one 0 \u2192 yes.\n\nSo this group fits.\n\nSecond group (3s):\n\n[3,0,0] \u2192 one 3 and two 0s \u2192 no.\n\n[0,3,3] \u2192 two 3s and one 0 \u2192 yes.\n\n[3,0,0] \u2192 one 3 and two 0s \u2192 no.\n\nSo this group doesn't fit all three rows.\n\nThird group (2s):\n\n[2,0,0] \u2192 one 2, two 0s \u2192 no.\n\nSo no.\n\nFourth group (8s):\n\n[8,0,0] \u2192 one 8, two 0s \u2192 no.\n\n[0,8,8] \u2192 two 8s and one 0 \u2192 yes.\n\n[8,0,0] \u2192 one 8 \u2192 no.\n\nSo this group only has one row that fits. So the only group where all three rows have two instances of the number and one zero is the first group (7s). Hence, it's selected.\n\nThis seems to fit. Let's check other examples.\n\nExample0's input groups:\n\nGroup0 (6s):\n\n[6,0,6] \u2192 two 6s and one 0 \u2192 yes.\n\n[0,6,6] \u2192 two 6s and one 0 \u2192 yes.\n\n[6,0,6] \u2192 two 6s and one 0 \u2192 yes.\n\nSo this group meets the criteria. But the output is the 8 group. So this contradicts the theory.\n\nHmm. So in Example0, the first group (6s) meets the criteria of each row having two instances of 6 and one 0. But the output is the 8 group, which has rows with three 8s and one row with two 8s and a 0. So this theory is incorrect.\n\nSo why is the output the 8 group in Example0?\n\nLooking at the 8 group in Example0:\n\n[8,8,8] \u2192 three 8s, no zeros \u2192 doesn't fit.\n\n[8,0,8] \u2192 two 8s and one 0 \u2192 yes.\n\n[8,8,8] \u2192 three 8s \u2192 no.\n\nSo only one row in this group meets the two instances and one zero. So according to the previous theory, this group shouldn't be selected. But it is. So the theory is incorrect.\n\nThus, this approach is not working.\n\nAlternative idea: The output is the group where the middle row has a zero in the middle position. For example:\n\nExample0's output middle row is [8,0,8] \u2192 yes.\n\nExample1's middle row is [0,7,0] \u2192 no, the middle is 7. Wait, Example1's output middle row is [0,7,0], so the zero is in positions 0 and 2. Not the middle. So this theory is incorrect.\n\nAnother angle: Let's look for the presence of a specific pattern in the group. For example, the group might form a diamond pattern when viewed as a 3x3 grid. Like:\n\nRow1: X X X\n\nRow2: X 0 X\n\nRow3: X X X\n\nWhich is Example0's output. So the middle of the group's middle row has a zero. But in Example1's output, the middle row is [0,7,0], which has zeros in the first and third positions. So not the middle.\n\nThis is confusing.\n\nAlternatively, the output group is the last group in the input. In Example0, the output is the last group. Example1's input has three rows, and the output is the last three elements? Wait, Example1's input is three rows of 12 elements each, but the output is three rows of 3 elements each. So perhaps the input is a list of numbers that are grouped into triplets.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is the group that contains the maximum number of non-zero elements. But this doesn't fit.\n\nAnother approach: Looking at the test input to see if a pattern can be inferred.\n\nTest Input:\n\n[0,5,0]\n[5,0,5]\n[0,5,0]\n[0,3,0]\n[3,0,3]\n[0,3,0]\n[6,0,6]\n[6,6,0]\n[6,0,6]\n[0,4,0]\n[4,0,4]\n[0,4,0]\n[0,8,0]\n[8,0,8]\n[0,8,0]\n\nLooking at the groups:\n\nGroup 0: 5s (three rows):\n\n[0,5,0]\n\n[5,0,5]\n\n[0,5,0]\n\nEach row has two 5s and one 0. So all three rows fit the two instances of 5 and a 0.\n\nGroup1:3s (three rows):\n\n[0,3,0]\n\n[3,0,3]\n\n[0,3,0]\n\nSimilarly, each row has two 3s and one 0.\n\nGroup2:6s (three rows):\n\n[6,0,6]\n\n[6,6,0]\n\n[6,0,6]\n\nFirst and third rows have two 6s and one 0. Middle row has two 6s and a zero as well (since [6,6,0] has two 6s and one 0). So all three rows fit.\n\nGroup3:4s:\n\n[0,4,0]\n\n[4,0,4]\n\n[0,4,0]\n\nSame as 5s and 3s.\n\nGroup4:8s (three rows):\n\n[0,8,0]\n\n[8,0,8]\n\n[0,8,0]\n\nEach row has two 8s and one 0.\n\nNow, according to the training examples, the output would likely be the group with the highest number, which is 8. But in Example3, the highest number (8) was present but not selected. So why?\n\nWait, in Example3, the 8 group's rows are:\n\n[8,0,0]\n\n[0,8,8]\n\n[8,0,0]\n\nEach row has two 8s and a 0. So they all fit the two instances and one zero. But the output was the 7 group. So why was that selected?\n\nThis suggests that the selection isn't based on the highest number. So maybe the first group that meets the criteria of three rows each having two instances of the same number and one zero. \n\nBut in Example0, the first group (6s) meets this criteria, but the output is the 8 group. So that theory is incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, the output is the last group that meets the criteria. In Example0, the 8 group is last, so selected. Example1's output is the 7 group, which is the last group in the input? Let's check:\n\nExample1's input is three rows. How are they grouped?\n\nThe input for Example1 is three rows:\n\nRow1: [2,0,0,3,0,0,7,0,7,1,0,0]\n\nRow2: [2,0,0,3,0,0,0,7,0,1,0,0]\n\nRow3: [0,2,2,0,3,3,7,0,7,0,1,1]\n\nBut the output is three rows of three elements each. So perhaps the input rows are divided into triplets of elements. For example, Row1 is a list of 12 elements. Split into four triplets: elements 0-2, 3-5, 6-8, 9-11.\n\nSo the groups would be:\n\nTriplet 0: [2,0,0], [3,0,0], [7,0,7], [1,0,0]\n\nTriplet 1: [2,0,0], [3,0,0], [0,7,0], [1,0,0]\n\nTriplet 2: [0,2,2], [0,3,3], [7,0,7], [0,1,1]\n\nBut the output is three rows: [7,0,7], [0,7,0], [7,0,7]. Which corresponds to the triplet 6-8 elements from each original row. Row1's triplet 6-8:7,0,7. Row2's triplet 6-8:0,7,0. Row3's triplet 6-8:7,0,7. So the group is formed by taking the 7th to 9th elements of each row.\n\nIf this is the pattern, then the output is the triplet from the input rows that forms a group where each element in the triplet is part of a group where the non-zero numbers are the same and arranged with zeros in certain positions.\n\nBut this would require that the input is a list of rows, each representing multiple triplets, and the output is a specific triplet group. For example, in Example1, the triplet group [7,0,7], [0,7,0], [7,0,7] is the group with the highest number (7) and forms a palindrome or certain pattern.\n\nThis would mean that for the test input, we need to look for the triplet group with the highest number that fits the required pattern.\n\nBut this is getting very complex. Let's try applying this to the test input.\n\nThe test input is 15 rows, each with three elements. So divided into five groups of three rows each:\n\nGroup0:5s:\n\n[0,5,0]\n\n[5,0,5]\n\n[0,5,0]\n\nGroup1:3s:\n\n[0,3,0]\n\n[3,0,3]\n\n[0,3,0]\n\nGroup2:6s:\n\n[6,0,6]\n\n[6,6,0]\n\n[6,0,6]\n\nGroup3:4s:\n\n[0,4,0]\n\n[4,0,4]\n\n[0,4,0]\n\nGroup4:8s:\n\n[0,8,0]\n\n[8,0,8]\n\n[0,8,0]\n\nEach group has three rows. Each row in these groups has two instances of the number and one zero. The numbers are 5,3,6,4,8. The highest number is 8. So according to Examples0,1,2, the highest number's group should be selected. But in Example3, the highest group (8) was present but not selected. So why?\n\nWait, in Example3, the 8 group's rows are:\n\n[8,0,0]\n\n[0,8,8]\n\n[8,0,0]\n\nEach row has two 8s and one zero. But the output was the 7s group, which had two 7s and one zero in each row. But the 8 group in Example3 is also valid. So why was it not selected?\n\nThis suggests that the selection is not based on the highest number. But in other examples, it was. So there's inconsistency.\n\nAnother possibility: The output group is the first group where all three rows have the same number and the zeros are in different positions. For Example3's 7s group, each row has a zero in a different position, whereas the 8s group has two rows with zeros in the same positions. For example, the 8 group's first and third rows have zeros in positions 1 and 2. So perhaps the group needs to have all three rows with the zero in different positions.\n\nIn the test input's 8 group:\n\n[0,8,0] \u2192 zero at 0 and 2.\n\n[8,0,8] \u2192 zero at 1.\n\n[0,8,0] \u2192 zero at 0 and 2.\n\nSo the zeros are in positions 0, 2 in two rows and 1 in the middle. So each row has at least one zero, but not all three positions are covered uniquely.\n\nThe 6 group in the test input:\n\n[6,0,6] \u2192 zero at 1.\n\n[6,6,0] \u2192 zero at 2.\n\n[6,0,6] \u2192 zero at 1.\n\nSo zeros in positions 1 and 2. Not all three positions.\n\nThe 5 group:\n\n[0,5,0] \u2192 zeros at 0 and 2.\n\n[5,0,5] \u2192 zero at 1.\n\n[0,5,0] \u2192 zeros at 0 and 2.\n\nSo zeros in positions 0,1, and 2 across the three rows. Because first row has zeros at 0 and 2, middle at 1, third at 0 and 2. So collectively, all three positions have zeros. But in the first and third rows, zeros are in two positions. So perhaps this group meets the criteria of having each zero position covered once.\n\nBut this is a stretch.\n\nIn Example3's output group:\n\nRows:\n\n[0,7,7] \u2192 zero at 0.\n\n[7,7,0] \u2192 zero at 2.\n\n[7,0,7] \u2192 zero at 1.\n\nSo each row has a zero in a different position (0, 2, 1). So collectively, all three positions are covered once. This is the only group in Example3's input that meets this. The 8 group in Example3 doesn't because the zeros are in positions 0 and 2 in two rows. So this group is selected.\n\nSo the pattern is: select the group where each row has a single zero, and the zeros are in different positions across the three rows, covering all three positions (0,1,2) once.\n\nLet's check other examples.\n\nExample0's output group:\n\nRows: [8,8,8], [8,0,8], [8,8,8]. Only the middle row has a zero in position 1. The other rows have no zeros. So this doesn't meet the criteria. But it's the output. So this theory is incorrect.\n\nExample1's output group:\n\nRows: [7,0,7], [0,7,0], [7,0,7].\n\nZeros in positions 1, 0 and 2 (middle row has zeros at 0 and 2), but first and third rows have zero at 1. So not all three positions are covered uniquely.\n\nExample2's output group:\n\n[4,0,4], [4,4,4], [4,0,4]. Only position 1 has zeros. So doesn't fit.\n\nThis suggests that the pattern is different.\n\nAnother approach: The output group is the first group where each row is a palindrome. \n\nExample0's output group: all rows are palindromes.\n\nExample1's output group: all rows are palindromes.\n\nExample2's output group: first and third rows are palindromes (4,0,4), middle row is all 4s (also a palindrome). So all are palindromes.\n\nExample3's output group:\n\n[0,7,7] \u2192 reversed is [7,7,0] which is the second row. The third row [7,0,7] is a palindrome. So perhaps the group consists of two mirrored rows and a palindrome. But how does this fit the pattern.\n\nIn the test input groups:\n\nThe 5 group:\n\n[0,5,0] \u2192 palindrome.\n\n[5,0,5] \u2192 palindrome.\n\n[0,5,0] \u2192 palindrome.\n\nAll rows are palindromes.\n\nThe 3 group:\n\n[0,3,0] \u2192 palindrome.\n\n[3,0,3] \u2192 palindrome.\n\n[0,3,0] \u2192 palindrome.\n\nSame.\n\nThe 6 group:\n\n[6,0,6] \u2192 palindrome.\n\n[6,6,0] \u2192 not a palindrome.\n\n[6,0,6] \u2192 palindrome.\n\nSo middle row is not a palindrome. So this group wouldn't be selected.\n\nThe 4 group:\n\nAll rows are palindromes.\n\nThe 8 group:\n\n[0,8,0] \u2192 palindrome.\n\n[8,0,8] \u2192 palindrome.\n\n[0,8,0] \u2192 palindrome.\n\nSo all rows are palindromes.\n\nSo the test input has multiple groups where all rows are palindromes. How to choose which one to output?\n\nIf the pattern is to select the group with the highest number where all rows are palindromes, then the 8 group would be selected. This fits with Examples0,1,2, where the highest number's group is selected if all rows are palindromes.\n\nBut in Example3, the output group's rows are not all palindromes. The first row [0,7,7] is not a palindrome, as reversing it gives [7,7,0], which is the second row. The third row [7,0,7] is a palindrome. So this theory doesn't fit.\n\nSo perhaps the pattern is to select the group where all rows are palindromes and the number is the highest. In the test input, the 8 group fits, so output that.\n\nBut in Example3, the output group does not fit this pattern. So there's inconsistency.\n\nThis is getting really tricky. Let me try to recap the training examples:\n\n- Example0: Output is the group with the highest number (8), all rows are palindromes.\n\n- Example1: Output is the group with the highest number (7), all rows are palindromes.\n\n- Example2: Output is the group with the highest number (4), all rows are palindromes.\n\n- Example3: Output is the group with 7s, which is not the highest number (8 is higher), but the 7 group's rows are not all palindromes. So this breaks the pattern.\n\nBut Example3's output is the first group in the input. So why?\n\nAnother possibility: The output is the first group where the number appears in all three rows and forms a certain pattern, regardless of being the highest. But in Example0, the first group (6s) meets this but isn't the output.\n\nAlternatively, the output group is the one where the first and third rows are the same, and the middle row has a zero in the middle. This fits Example0, Example1, Example2, but not Example3.\n\nExample3's output:\n\nFirst row: [0,7,7]\n\nThird row: [7,0,7]\n\nNot the same. So this doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. Perhaps the pattern is that the output group is the last group in the input that meets a certain condition. In Example0, the output is the last group. Example1's output is the last triplet. Example2's output is also the last group. Example3's output is the first group, which contradicts this.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output group is the first one that is repeated three times in the input. For example, in Example0, the 6 group is repeated three times, but the output is the 8 group which is also three times. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, looking for the group that has the same structure as the output examples. For instance, in Example0's output, the structure is:\n\nX X X\n\nX 0 X\n\nX X X\n\nWhere X is 8.\n\nIn Example1's output:\n\nX 0 X\n\n0 X 0\n\nX 0 X\n\nWhere X is 7.\n\nIn Example2's output:\n\nX 0 X\n\nX X X\n\nX 0 X\n\nWhere X is 4.\n\nExample3's output:\n\n0 X X\n\nX X 0\n\nX 0 X\n\nWhere X is 7.\n\nSo the pattern varies. This makes it hard to find a consistent rule.\n\nAnother angle: Let's look at the length of the output groups. All training examples have three rows in the output. The test input's output should also have three rows. The key is to select which three rows from the test input form the correct group.\n\nLooking at the test input, the groups are:\n\nGroup0 (5s):\n\n[0,5,0]\n\n[5,0,5]\n\n[0,5,0]\n\nGroup1 (3s):\n\n[0,3,0]\n\n[3,0,3]\n\n[0,3,0]\n\nGroup2 (6s):\n\n[6,0,6]\n\n[6,6,0]\n\n[6,0,6]\n\nGroup3 (4s):\n\n[0,4,0]\n\n[4,0,4]\n\n[0,4,0]\n\nGroup4 (8s):\n\n[0,8,0]\n\n[8,0,8]\n\n[0,8,0]\n\nAll these groups are structured with the first and third rows being the same, and the middle row being a different arrangement. For example, group0's middle row is [5,0,5], which is a palindrome. Group4's middle row is [8,0,8], also a palindrome. Group2's middle row is [6,6,0], which is not a palindrome. \n\nIn the training examples, when the group is the highest number and the middle row is a palindrome, it's selected. So for the test input, the highest number is 8. The 8 group's middle row is [8,0,8], which is a palindrome. The other rows are [0,8,0] (palindrome) and [0,8,0] (same). So all rows are palindromes. So this group would be selected. \n\nBut Example3's output group isn't like this, which complicates things. However, maybe Example3 is an exception due to the way the groups are structured. \n\nGiven that in the test input, the highest number is 8 and the 8 group's rows are all palindromes, the output should be the 8 group. But according to Example3, sometimes a lower number is selected. But since Example3's input had the 8 group's rows not all being palindromes, perhaps the pattern is that the group must have all rows as palindromes and the highest number.\n\nIn Example3, the 8 group's rows are:\n\n[8,0,0] \u2192 not a palindrome.\n\n[0,8,8] \u2192 not a palindrome.\n\n[8,0,0] \u2192 not a palindrome.\n\nSo they aren't palindromes. Hence, the 7 group is selected because it's the highest group where all rows are palindromes. But wait, the 7 group's rows are:\n\n[0,7,7] \u2192 not a palindrome.\n\n[7,7,0] \u2192 not a palindrome.\n\n[7,0,7] \u2192 palindrome.\n\nOnly the third row is a palindrome. So this theory doesn't hold.\n\nThis is really challenging. Let's try to proceed with the test input. If the pattern in the training examples is that the output is the group with the highest number where all rows are palindromes, then the test input's 8 group would be the answer. But Example3's existence complicates this. However, perhaps Example3 is a special case where the highest number's group isn't all palindromes, so the next highest is selected. \n\nAlternatively, the pattern is that the output group is the first group in the input where each row is a palindrome and the number is the highest possible. \n\nIn the test input, the 8 group is the last group, and all rows are palindromes. So it would be selected. \n\nBased on the training examples, particularly Examples0,1,2, where the highest number's group with palindromic rows is selected, I think the answer is the 8 group. \n\nTherefore, the output for the test input would be:\n\n[0,8,0]\n[8,0,8]\n[0,8,0]\n\nBut wait, looking at the test input's 8 group:\n\nRow1: [0,8,0]\n\nRow2: [8,0,8]\n\nRow3: [0,8,0]\n\nAll rows are palindromes, and 8 is the highest number. So this fits the pattern observed in Examples0,1,2. Example3 is an exception where the highest number's group wasn't palindromic, so the next highest was selected. Therefore, in the test input, the 8 group should be selected.",

        "cot_2": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. So, looking at the training examples. Each input is a list of lists, and the output is a subset of those lists. Hmm. Let's start with Example 0. The input has multiple rows, and the output is the last three rows. Wait, no. Let's see:\n\nIn Example 0, the input has 9 rows. The output is the three rows starting with [8,8,8], which are the 7th, 8th, and 9th rows. But why those? Let me check the other examples.\n\nIn Example 1, the input has 3 rows. The output is the last three rows, which are [7,0,7], [0,7,0], [7,0,7]. Wait, but the input only has three rows. So how does that fit? Wait, the input here is three rows, but the output is three rows that seem to be a pattern of 7s. Let me look at the input for Example1 again. The input lists are:\n\n[2,0,0,3,0,0,7,0,7,1,0,0]\n[2,0,0,3,0,0,0,7,0,1,0,0]\n[0,2,2,0,3,3,7,0,7,0,1,1]\n\nThe output is three rows of shorter length. Wait, the output is [7,0,7], [0,7,0], [7,0,7]. Oh! So maybe the output is taking the part of the input rows where the numbers are the maximum in the entire input. Let's check: in Example0, the input has numbers 6, 0, 4, 8. The maximum is 8. The output is the three rows with 8s. Similarly, Example1's input has numbers up to 7. The output is the part of the rows that include the 7s. Wait, but how?\n\nLooking at Example0's input, the first few rows have 6s and 4s. The last three rows are all 8s. So perhaps the output is the set of rows that have the maximum value from all the elements. Let's confirm:\n\nExample0's max is 8. The output has all 8s. Example1's max is 7, and the output rows are centered around 7. Example2's output is [4,0,4], etc., and the max in the input is 8? Wait, in Example2's input, the numbers include 3,4,2,8,1. The maximum is 8, but the output is 4s. That contradicts. So maybe that's not the pattern.\n\nHmm. Let's look at Example2. The input has numbers 3,4,2,8,1. The output is [4,0,4], [4,4,4], [4,0,4]. The max here would be 8, but the output is 4. So that approach might not be right.\n\nAlternative approach: maybe the output is the three rows that form a symmetrical pattern. For example, in Example0, the output is three rows that form a diamond shape with 8s. Similarly, in Example1, the output is three rows forming a sort of cross with 7s. In Example3, the output is the first three rows which have a 7 pattern.\n\nWait, let's see Example3's input. The input has several blocks of three rows each. The output is the first three rows. But why? The first three rows are [0,7,7], [7,7,0], [7,0,7]. That forms a kind of pattern. Maybe each group in the input is three rows, and the output is the group with the highest maximum value? For example, in Example0, the input is structured in groups of three rows each. The first group (6,0,6 etc.), then the next with 4s, then the last group with 8s. The output is the group with the highest value (8s). Example1's input is three rows, which might form one group, and the output is that group's part with 7s. Example3's input has multiple groups of three rows each (like [0,7,7], [7,7,0], [7,0,7] as first group, then 3s group, 2s, 8s, etc.), and the output is the first group which has 7s, the highest value among the groups. Example2's input has groups of three rows each. The first group is [3,0,0,4,0,4,2,0,0,8,0,0,1,0,0]? Wait, but the input rows in Example2 are three rows with longer lists. Maybe each group is three rows, and the output is the group where the maximum number in that group is the highest among all groups.\n\nSo let's test that. For Example0, the groups are three rows each. The first group has 6s (max 6), then 4s (max4), then 8s (max8). So output is the 8 group. Example3's groups: first group has 7s (max7), next 3s (3), then 2s (2), 8s (8). Wait, but the output in Example3 is the first group (7s), which has a lower max than the 8s group. So that doesn't fit. Hmm. So maybe that's not the pattern.\n\nAlternative idea: The output is the group (three consecutive rows) where the group's elements form a certain pattern. For example, in Example0's output, the group is [8,8,8], [8,0,8], [8,8,8], which is a square with 8s and a 0 in the center. Similarly, Example1's output is three rows: [7,0,7], [0,7,0], [7,0,7], forming a cross. Example2's output is [4,0,4], [4,4,4], [4,0,4], which is a diamond shape. Example3's output is a pattern of 7s that's a sort of diagonal maybe. So perhaps the output is the group that forms a symmetrical pattern, and among all such groups, it's the one with the highest numerical value.\n\nIn Example3, the output is the first group (7s), even though there's an 8 group later. But perhaps the 8 group's pattern isn't correct. Let's check the test input. The test input has groups:\n\nFirst group:\n[0,5,0]\n[5,0,5]\n[0,5,0]\n\nThen 3s group:\n[0,3,0]\n[3,0,3]\n[0,3,0]\n\nThen 6s group:\n[6,0,6]\n[6,6,0]\n[6,0,6]\n\nThen 4s group:\n[0,4,0]\n[4,0,4]\n[0,4,0]\n\nThen 8s group:\n[0,8,0]\n[8,0,8]\n[0,8,0]\n\nEach group is three rows. Now, looking for the group that forms a symmetrical pattern. The first group (5s) forms a cross: 0,5,0; 5,0,5; 0,5,0. The 3s group is similar. The 6s group has a different pattern: the middle row is [6,6,0], which breaks symmetry. The 4s group is like the 5s and 3s. The 8s group is the cross again. Now, according to the training examples, the output would be the group with the highest number that has a valid pattern. The 8s group is the highest, and their pattern is a cross. So the output would be those three rows. But wait in the training examples, Example3's output was the 7s group even though there was an 8s group. So why wasn't the 8s group chosen there?\n\nLooking back at Example3's input:\n\nThe input has:\n\nGroup1 (7s):\n[0,7,7]\n[7,7,0]\n[7,0,7]\n\nGroup2 (3s):\n[3,0,0]\n[0,3,3]\n[3,0,0]\n\nGroup3 (2s):\n[2,0,0]\n[0,2,2]\n[2,0,0]\n\nGroup4 (8s):\n[8,0,0]\n[0,8,8]\n[8,0,0]\n\nThe output is the first group (7s), which is the highest among the groups. The 8s group's pattern is [8,0,0], [0,8,8], [8,0,0]. That doesn't form the same cross or diamond as other outputs. For example, the 7s group in Example3's output has a different pattern. So perhaps the required pattern is that in each row of the group, the non-zero elements form a certain arrangement, and the highest such group is selected.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that the middle element of the group's middle row is 0, and surrounded by the same number. For example, in Example0's output:\n\n[8,8,8]\n[8,0,8]\n[8,8,8]\n\nMiddle element is 0. Similarly, Example1's output middle row is [0,7,0]. Example2's output middle row is [4,4,4] (no 0 here, so that might not fit). Wait, no. Example2's output is:\n\n[4,0,4]\n[4,4,4]\n[4,0,4]\n\nMiddle row is all 4s, so that's different. Hmm.\n\nAnother angle: looking at the output groups in each example. Let's list their structures:\n\nExample0 output: 8s form a square with a 0 center.\n\nExample1: 7s form a cross, middle row has 0 in the center.\n\nExample2: 4s form a diamond with middle row full of 4s.\n\nExample3: 7s form a kind of diagonal pattern.\n\nSo maybe the output is the group where each row has the same number, arranged in a certain way, and the highest such number. But in Example3, the highest number in the groups is 8, but the output is 7s. So that contradicts.\n\nWait, let's check the numbers in Example3's groups:\n\nGroup1 (7s): elements are 7 and 0.\n\nGroup4 (8s): elements are 8 and 0.\n\nBut the output is group1. So why isn't group4 chosen? Maybe the 8s group's pattern isn't valid. Let's see:\n\nGroup4 in Example3's input:\n\n[8,0,0]\n[0,8,8]\n[8,0,0]\n\nThis is three rows. The first and third rows have 8 followed by two 0s. The middle row has 0,8,8. That doesn't form a symmetrical pattern like the output examples. So perhaps the pattern requires that each row in the group has exactly two non-zero elements that are mirrored. Or that the group forms a specific shape.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the group that has the maximum number of non-zero elements. But in Example0's output group, each row has three 8s except the middle one which has two 8s and a 0. That's more non-zero than other groups.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is the group where the sum of the elements is the highest. Let's compute:\n\nIn Example0's output group:\n\n8+8+8 =24; 8+0+8=16; 24 again. Total sum 24+16+24=64.\n\nOther groups in Example0's input: first group with 6s: each row sum is 12, 12, 12. So total 36. So output group has higher sum. So that's possible.\n\nExample1's output group sums:7+0+7=14; 0+7+0=7; 14 again. Total 35. The input group's other rows have higher numbers but maybe not.\n\nBut Example3's output group sum: 7+7=14; 7+7=14;7+7=14. Total 42. The 8s group sum would be 8 in first row, 16 in second, 8 in third. Total 32. So the 7s group has higher sum. So maybe the output is the group with the highest sum.\n\nIn Example2's input groups:\n\nThe output group is 4s. Let's see the sum: each row in output group is 4+0+4=8; 4+4+4=12; 8. Total 28. Other groups: the 3s group sum per row: 3+0+0=3; 0+3+3=6; 3+0+0=3. Total 12. The 8s group (in Example2's input) sum per row: 8, then 0+8+8=16, 8. Total 8+16+8=32. But the output group is 4s with sum 28. So that contradicts the sum idea.\n\nHmm. So maybe the sum isn't the key.\n\nAlternative approach: looking for the output group's structure. Each output group in the examples has a central element that is either 0 or the same as the surrounding. For example, Example0's output has middle element 0. Example1's middle element is 0. Example2's middle element is 4. Example3's middle element is 7 (the middle row's middle element is 7 in the first row of the output group? Wait, Example3's output is:\n\n[0,7,7]\n[7,7,0]\n[7,0,7]\n\nMiddle row's middle element is 7. So no 0 there. Hmm. This seems inconsistent.\n\nAnother thought: the output group is the one that contains the highest number of occurrences of a certain number, arranged in a specific pattern. For example, the pattern might be a certain shape where the number repeats. Like in Example0, the output group is a square of 8s. In Example1, a cross of 7s. In Example2, a diamond of 4s. In Example3, a kind of diagonal pattern of 7s.\n\nSo the pattern is that each output group forms a specific geometric shape with the same number, and the group with the highest such number is selected.\n\nIn Example3, even though there's an 8 group, maybe the 8s group doesn't form a valid shape. The 8s group in Example3's input is:\n\n[8,0,0]\n[0,8,8]\n[8,0,0]\n\nThis looks like two 8s in the middle row, but the first and third rows have 8 only in the first position. That doesn't form a symmetrical shape. Whereas the 7s group in Example3's output is:\n\n[0,7,7]\n[7,7,0]\n[7,0,7]\n\nWhich seems to have a pattern where each row has two 7s arranged in different positions. Maybe it's a specific symmetry.\n\nNow, looking at the test input. The test input has groups for 5,3,6,4,8. Each group is three rows. The 5s group:\n\n[0,5,0]\n[5,0,5]\n[0,5,0]\n\nThis forms a cross. The 3s group is similar. The 6s group has:\n\n[6,0,6]\n[6,6,0]\n[6,0,6]\n\nThe middle row is [6,6,0], which isn't symmetrical in the same way. The 4s group is cross-shaped. The 8s group is cross-shaped:\n\n[0,8,0]\n[8,0,8]\n[0,8,0]\n\nWait, the 8s group in the test input is:\n\nFirst row: [0,8,0]\nSecond row: [8,0,8]\nThird row: [0,8,0]\n\nWhich forms a cross shape, similar to Example1's output. The 5s group is the same pattern. Among the groups, the highest number is 8. So according to the training examples, the output should be the 8s group. So the answer would be those three rows."
