        "cot_1": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. So, looking at the training examples, the input has rows with a 7 in a certain position, and the output seems to have 7s and 8s arranged in some pattern around those positions.\n\nStarting with Example 0: The input has four rows with a 7 in the fourth position (index 3) and one all-zero row at the bottom. The output shows that around each 7, there's an 8. The first row of the output starts with 8,7,8,7, etc., which looks like it's alternating. Then each subsequent row has fewer elements, maybe forming a diamond or triangle shape around the original 7s. The 7s from the input are preserved, and the 8s are added around them. Also, the 8s seem to be placed in a pattern that expands outward but then tapers off as you go down the rows. Maybe it's like a wave or a ripple effect starting from each 7's position.\n\nIn Example 1, the input has five rows with 7 in the third position (index 2) and two all-zero rows. The output starts with 7,8,7,8... in the first row, then next rows have one less element each time. The 7s are still present where they were, and the 8s are added around them. It looks like each 7 in the input is acting as a center, and then 8s are placed to the left and right, alternating with 7s. But the arrangement is such that each row above the original 7's row has expanding 8s and 7s, and then it starts to contract as the rows go down. Wait, in Example 1's output, the first row is [7,8,7,8,7,8,7,0], which suggests that starting from the position of the original 7 (index 2), they alternate 7 and 8 expanding to both left and right, but maybe limited by the row's length.\n\nHmm. Another observation: In Example 0's input, all the 7s are in the same column (column 3). The output in each row seems to have 7s in the same column, but 8s around them. The number of 8s decreases as we go down the rows, creating a diamond shape. For instance, the first output row has 8s alternating with 7s. Then the next row has 7s and 8s but with fewer elements, maybe because the 8s are added on both sides but limited by the edges. So maybe the pattern is that each original 7 in the input column generates a diamond-shaped structure of 8s around it, alternating with 7s, and overlapping with other structures if there are multiple 7s in the same column.\n\nWait, in Example 0, the output's first row is [8,7,8,7,8,7,8]. The original 7 is in position 3. So positions 0, 2, 4, 6 are 8, and positions 1,3,5 are 7. Wait, but the original 7 was at position 3. So maybe each 7 in the input column creates a pattern where adjacent positions alternate 8 and 7, expanding outward. But how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each 7 in the input column causes the rows above and below to have 8s adjacent to it, and then those 8s generate their own adjacent 7s, but that might not fit.\n\nLooking at the outputs: In Example 0, the first row of the output has 8,7,8,7,8,7,8. So starting from the original column 3 (value 7), the adjacent positions (2 and 4) are 8, then 1 and 5 would be 7, 0 and 6 would be 8. Wait, but the original 7 is in column 3. So the pattern is alternating 8 and 7 moving away from the original 7. So in row 0 of the output, which was originally all zeros except for the 7 in column 3, the output row now has 8s and 7s alternating, starting with 8 at the edges. But how does that connect to the rows below?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each 7 in the input is a seed, and the output builds a structure where each 7 has 8s above and below, and those 8s have 7s next to them, but that's not exactly matching the examples.\n\nLooking at Example 1's input: The 7s are in column 2 for five rows. The output starts with a row that has 7,8,7,8,7,8,7,0. So starting at column 2 (the original 7), then alternating 8 and 7 to the right and left. But in the first row of the output, the 7 is at position 0, which might not be part of the original input. Wait, but the input's first row was [0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0], so output's first row is [7,8,7,8,7,8,7,0]. So the 7 is now at position 0? That seems like maybe there's an upward expansion. Wait, maybe the 7s in the input are creating a pattern that spreads upwards and downwards, but how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each 7 in the input acts as the center of a diamond shape, where each layer around it (in rows) adds 8s and 7s in an alternating pattern. For example, the original 7 is in row 0 (input), then row 1 has 8s above and below, but in the outputs, the rows are arranged such that each level up or down from the original 7s adds more 8s and 7s in a pattern.\n\nWait, maybe the transformation is that for each 7 in a column, you create a diamond pattern where each row above and below the original 7's row has alternating 8 and 7 values, starting from the column of the 7 and expanding outward. The number of rows affected depends on the number of consecutive 7s in the input. For example, in Example 0, there are four consecutive rows with 7s. The output's diamond pattern might spread up and down based on the number of 7s. Similarly, in Example 1, there are five consecutive rows with 7s, leading to a larger diamond.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the number of 7s in the input's column determines the height of the diamond in the output. For example, four 7s in a column (Example 0) result in a diamond that spans up to four rows. Then each row of the diamond has 7s and 8s arranged in a certain way.\n\nLooking at Example 0's output: The first four rows of the input become the first four rows of the output, with the top row having all 8 and 7 alternating. Then each subsequent row has fewer elements, perhaps truncating from both ends. The first output row is [8,7,8,7,8,7,8], which is full length, the next is [0,7,8,7,8,7,0], then [0,0,8,7,8,0,0], then the original row with just 7. So the pattern seems to form a diamond where each layer adds 0s on the edges and the center alternates 8 and 7.\n\nSimilarly, in Example 1's output, the first few rows have a pattern that starts with 7,8,7,8..., then each subsequent row loses elements from the end, but also starts adding 0s on the left. Wait, the first output row is [7,8,7,8,7,8,7,0], then the next is [7,8,7,8,7,8,0,0], then [7,8,7,8,7,0,0,0], then [0,8,7,8,0,0,0,0], and so on. The original 7s are in column 2 of the input. The output's first row has 7 in column 0, which suggests that the pattern is expanding leftwards. Hmm, that's confusing.\n\nWait, maybe the 7s in the input are in column x, and in the output, for each row in the input that has a 7, the output starts building a diamond shape where each level (row) above and below the original row adds 8s and 7s. The expansion is such that each step away from the original row adds a layer of 8 and 7 around the previous layer. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe each 7 in the input column creates a diamond pattern where each row in the output is built by expanding left and right from the 7's position, alternating 8 and 7, but limited by the number of rows with 7s in the input. For instance, in Example 0, four 7s in a column mean that the diamond can expand three layers (since four rows: maybe each layer corresponds to a row). So the top row (layer 0) is the original row, but transformed. Wait, maybe the number of 7s determines how many layers of expansion there are.\n\nAnother approach: Let's look at the positions of 8s in the output and see how they relate to the input 7s.\n\nIn Example 0's input, all 7s are in column 3. The output has 8s in columns 0,2,4,6 in the first row. Then columns 1,3,5 in the next row have 7s. Wait, but the original 7s are in column 3. So perhaps each 7 in the input column generates a diamond where each diagonal step away from the 7's position adds an 8, alternating with 7s. But how?\n\nAlternatively, considering that the output rows have a pattern that starts with 8,7,8,7... in the first row, then in the next row, the 8s are shifted inward. It could be that the output is forming a pyramid-like structure where each level adds a layer around the 7, but the exact transformation isn't clear yet.\n\nWait, maybe the rule is: For each 7 in the input, in the output, create a diamond-shaped pattern where each cell at a Manhattan distance (sum of row and column differences) less than or equal to the number of consecutive 7s in the column from the 7's position is set to 8 if the distance is odd, and 7 if even. But that might not fit.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is generated by for each cell (i,j), if there's a 7 in column c in row i \u00b1 k, then the cell (i,j) becomes 8 if k is odd, 7 if k is even. But this is just a hypothesis.\n\nLet's take Example 0:\n\nInput has 7s in column 3 of rows 0-3. The output's first row (row 0) is [8,7,8,7,8,7,8]. The positions here are 0:8, 1:7, 2:8, 3:7 (original 7), 4:8, 5:7, 6:8. So for each position j in row 0, the value is 8 if (j - 3) is even? No, because j=0: 0-3=-3 (absolute 3, odd?), 8. j=1: 1-3=-2 (even) but 7. Hmm, that's not matching.\n\nAlternatively, the pattern alternates starting with 8 at the edges. For row 0 in Example 0, the 8s are at even indices (0,2,4,6), and 7s at odd indices (1,3,5). But the original 7 is at index 3 (odd). So perhaps the pattern alternates 8 and 7 starting from the edges. So the first element is 8, then 7, then 8, etc., but this doesn't explain why the original 7 remains.\n\nWait, the original 7 in the input is in column 3. In the output row 0, column 3 is 7. So the original 7s are preserved. Then the 8s are added in the neighboring columns. But how?\n\nLooking at Example 0's output rows:\n\nRow 0: 8,7,8,7,8,7,8. So the original 7 is at position 3. The pattern here is that starting from position 3, moving left and right, alternating between 7 and 8. Wait, but left from 3 is 2 (8), then 1 (7), then 0 (8). To the right of 3: 4 (8), 5 (7), 6 (8). So it's like 7 is at the center, and then alternating 8 and 7 outward. But starting with 8 next to the 7. So for each cell adjacent to the original 7, it's 8, then next cells are 7, then 8, etc. But that would result in 7,8,7,8... moving outward. But in the example, the pattern is 8,7,8,7... starting from the edge. Wait, that's confusing.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that each 7 in the input generates a wave of 8s and 7s expanding outward, where each expansion step alternates between 8 and 7. For example, the original 7 is in the center. The first expansion (one step away) is 8, then the next step (two steps away) is 7, then three steps away is 8 again, etc. But how does this apply to the rows above and below?\n\nLooking at Example 0's output, the first row (row 0) has 8s and 7s in a way that's symmetric around column 3. The same for other rows. But the rows below the original 7s (rows 0-3 in input, output rows 0-3) have decreasing numbers of elements. The output's row 1 is [0,7,8,7,8,7,0]. So the first and last elements are 0, then the next are 7,8, etc. So maybe the pattern is that each original 7 in a row contributes to a diamond shape, with the 7 at the center, and 8s and 7s spreading out, but also considering the rows above and below. The zeros in the output rows might be where the pattern hasn't reached yet or where the expansion stops.\n\nAnother approach: Let's see how the 7s and 8s are arranged in the output for each row.\n\nIn Example 0's output:\n\nRow 0: 8,7,8,7,8,7,8 (all positions except maybe edges are filled)\nRow 1: 0,7,8,7,8,7,0 (edges are 0)\nRow 2: 0,0,8,7,8,0,0 (more zeros on the edges)\nRow 3: 0,0,0,7,0,0,0 (original row)\nRow 4: all zeros.\n\nSo the pattern is that each row above the original rows (which are the first four) has a widening and then narrowing pattern. Wait, but how?\n\nPerhaps the number of 7s in the input column determines the height of the diamond. In Example 0, four 7s, so the diamond spans four rows. Each row in the diamond has a certain number of 7s and 8s.\n\nAlternatively, the distance from the top row of the 7s in the input. For example, if the input has 7s starting from row 0, then the output's diamond starts from there. But in Example 0, the input's 7s are in rows 0-3, and the output's diamond seems to be formed starting from row 0, but the first output row is transformed into a full pattern, then the next rows have parts of it.\n\nWait, maybe each original 7 in row i of the input contributes to the output by creating a pattern that expands upward and downward. For example, the original 7 in row i, column j would create a diamond where each level (row) away from i adds 8s and 7s around j. The number of levels depends on the number of consecutive 7s in the column. So if there are four 7s in a column, the diamond can expand three levels up and down.\n\nBut in Example 0, the input has four rows of 7s. The output's diamond seems to have four rows, with the first row being the top of the diamond, then each subsequent row has a narrower pattern. So perhaps the number of 7s in the column dictates the height of the diamond. For example, four 7s allow for a diamond that spans four rows, each with a certain pattern.\n\nIn Example 1, there are five 7s in the column, leading to a taller diamond in the output. The output's first three rows have expanding patterns, then it contracts.\n\nAnother angle: The output seems to be built by taking each original 7 and creating a structure where each 7 is surrounded by 8s, and those 8s are surrounded by 7s, and so on, but this needs to fit the examples.\n\nIn Example 0's output row 0: 8,7,8,7,8,7,8. The 7s are at positions 1,3,5. The original 7 is at position 3. So maybe each 8 is placed next to a 7, and then those 8s have 7s next to them, etc., creating a checkerboard pattern.\n\nBut how does this work across different rows?\n\nAlternatively, for each cell in the output, if it's adjacent (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) to a 7 in the input, it becomes 8. Then, any cell adjacent to those 8s becomes 7, and so on. But this might not fit.\n\nWait, let's consider Example 0's input. The 7s are in column 3, rows 0-3. If we apply a rule where each 7 in the input causes adjacent cells (including diagonally) to become 8, and those 8s cause their adjacent cells to become 7, but only if they are within a certain distance based on the number of 7s.\n\nBut Example 0's output doesn't seem to have 8s in diagonal positions. For instance, row 0 has 8s in columns 0,2,4,6. If the original 7s are in column 3, the adjacent cells would be columns 2 and 4. But in row 0's output, columns 0,2,4,6 are 8s. So that might suggest that the influence spreads outward, but not diagonally.\n\nPerhaps it's a horizontal spread. For each 7 in the input, in the output, we create a pattern where the 7's column is 7, and each neighboring column alternates between 8 and 7, expanding outward. But the number of expansions depends on the number of 7s in the column. For example, four 7s allow for three expansions (since each 7 in a row contributes to the pattern).\n\nBut how does the row structure affect this? The output's rows seem to be influenced by the rows of the input. For example, in Example 0's output, the first row has the maximum expansion (columns 0-6), then each subsequent row has less expansion, until it returns to the original 7.\n\nAlternatively, each row in the output is generated by taking the maximum possible expansion for that row level, but the pattern is such that each row has a certain number of 8s and 7s based on how far it is from the original 7's row.\n\nBut I'm not quite getting it. Let's try to see for each example's output row how it could be derived from the input.\n\nIn Example 0:\n\nInput rows 0-3: [0,0,0,7,0,0,0] each. Output row 0: [8,7,8,7,8,7,8]. Output row 1: [0,7,8,7,8,7,0]. Output row 2: [0,0,8,7,8,0,0]. Output row 3: [0,0,0,7,0,0,0]. \n\nNotice that the original 7 is always present. The pattern around it alternates 8 and 7, expanding outward but with zeros filling the edges as you move down the rows. \n\nFor row 0 of the output: the entire row is filled with alternating 8 and 7, starting with 8. The 7s are in the original positions (column 3) and then every other column. The number of elements is 7, which is the same as the input. \n\nRow 1 of the output starts and ends with 0, then has 7,8,7,8,7. So the pattern is shorter, padded with zeros on both ends. \n\nRow 2 has two zeros at each end, then 8,7,8. \n\nRow 3 has three zeros, then 7, then three zeros. \n\nIt looks like each subsequent row after the first has two more zeros (one on each end) than the previous row, and the inner part is the alternating 8 and 7 pattern. \n\nBut how does this relate to the number of original 7s in the input column? Example 0 has four 7s, and the output's diamond has four rows (0-3). Example 1 has five 7s, leading to five rows in the output's diamond. \n\nSo maybe the number of consecutive 7s in the input's column determines the number of rows in the output's diamond. The diamond starts from the top row of the input's 7s and extends downward. Each row in the diamond has a certain pattern. \n\nIn Example 0, the diamond has four rows. The first row (row 0) is filled with alternating 8 and 7. Then each subsequent row has more zeros on both ends and a shorter alternating sequence in the middle. \n\nIn Example 1's output, the first five rows form the diamond. The first row (row 0) starts with 7,8,7,8,7,8,7,0. Then row 1 has 7,8,7,8,7,8,0,0. Each row loses one element from the end and gains a zero. But why does it start with 7 in row 0? \n\nAh, perhaps the position of the 7 in the input's column affects the starting point of the pattern. In Example 0, the 7 is in column 3 (of 7 columns), so the diamond is centered there. In Example 1, the 7 is in column 2 (of 8 columns), so the diamond starts expanding to the left and right, but perhaps the left expansion hits the edge earlier. \n\nWait, in Example 1's output, the first row starts with 7,8,7,8... which suggests that the center is column 0, but the original 7s were in column 2. That doesn't make sense. \n\nWait, the input for Example 1 has 7s in column 2. The output's first row starts with 7 in column 0, then 8 in column 1, 7 in column 2, etc. So the pattern is [7,8,7,8,7,8,7,0]. But why does it start with 7 in column 0? \n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is mirrored. The original 7 is in column 2. So the diamond expands to the left and right. To the left of column 2, the columns are 1,0. To the right, 3,4,5,6,7. But the first row's pattern is 7,8,7,8,7,8,7,0. So starting from column 0, which is two positions to the left of the original 7's column. That suggests that the expansion starts from the left edge and alternates 7 and 8, but this doesn't fit with the original 7's position. \n\nThis is getting a bit confusing. Let's try to find a general rule.\n\nAnother observation: In both examples, the output rows have the same number of elements as the input rows. The transformation seems to replace certain zeros with 7s and 8s based on the original 7s' positions.\n\nIn Example 0, the original 7s are in column 3. The output's first row has 8s and 7s alternating, starting with 8. The 7s are at positions 1,3,5. So the original 7 is at position 3. Then, the pattern is 8 at even positions (0,2,4,6) and 7 at odd positions (1,3,5). But how is this determined? \n\nMaybe the rule is that for each original 7 in column c, in the output row, all positions j where (j - c) is even become 7, and odd become 8. Wait, that would mean for Example 0, column 3. j - 3 even: j=3 (0), j=1 (even?), but 1-3 = -2, which is even. So for j=0: 0-3= -3 (odd) \u2192 8. j=1: -2 (even) \u21927. j=2: -1 (odd) \u21928. j=3: 0 (even) \u21927. And so on. This would give the pattern 8,7,8,7,8,7,8. Which matches Example 0's first row. \n\nThen, in the next row (row 1 of the output), the pattern is [0,7,8,7,8,7,0]. The 7s are at positions 1,3,5. But according to the same rule, but shifted? Or maybe the rule is applied for each row, but the row's distance from the original 7's row determines the shift. \n\nAlternatively, maybe each row in the output is determined by the number of 7s in the input column. For Example 0, with four 7s, the first four output rows are part of the diamond. Each row i in the output (up to the number of 7s) has a pattern where the starting offset is i, and the alternating 8 and 7s are placed with that offset. \n\nFor example, in row 0 of Example 0's output, the pattern starts at position 0. In row 1, the pattern starts at position 1, but with zeros on the ends. Wait, but in row 1 of Example 0's output, the pattern is [0,7,8,7,8,7,0]. The first non-zero is 7 at position 1, then 8 at 2, etc. So maybe each subsequent row starts the pattern one position later and ends one position earlier, thus creating the diamond shape. \n\nSo the rule could be: For each row in the output, starting from the top, the number of leading and trailing zeros increases by one for each subsequent row. The non-zero part of the row alternates between 8 and 7, starting with 8 if the row index is even, or 7 if odd. \n\nBut how does this relate to the original 7's column? In Example 0, the non-zero part starts at column 0 in row 0, then column 1 in row 1, etc. But this doesn't align with the original 7's position. \n\nAlternatively, the pattern is centered around the original 7's column. For Example 0, the 7s are in column 3. The pattern in row 0 is centered at 3, spreading to both ends. Then each subsequent row has the pattern reduced by one on each side. \n\nBut how to generate the alternating 8 and 7. Let's model it:\n\nFor a given center column c, and row offset k (starting from 0 at the top), the pattern in each row would be:\n\n- The number of elements in the pattern is 2*(c - k) +1. Wait, perhaps not. \n\nAlternatively, for row k in the diamond, the pattern spans from c - k to c + k. Each position in that span alternates between 8 and 7. The first element (c -k) is 8 if k is even, 7 if odd. \n\nWait, in Example 0's output row 0 (k=0), the pattern spans from 3-0=3 to 3+0=3 (just column 3). But that's not the case. Row 0 has the entire row filled. Hmm, perhaps the diamond starts with a larger span and k increases. \n\nAlternatively, the number of rows in the diamond is equal to the number of original 7s. Each row in the diamond has a certain number of 8s and 7s. For Example 0 with four 7s, the diamond has four rows. \n\nRow 0: starts at position 0 and ends at position 6 (7 elements), alternating 8 and 7 starting with 8.\nRow 1: starts at position 1 and ends at 5 (5 elements), alternating 7 and 8 starting with 7.\nRow 2: starts at position 2 and ends at 4 (3 elements), alternating 8 and 7 starting with 8.\nRow 3: starts at position 3 (1 element), which is 7.\n\nThis matches Example 0's output. The starting element alternates between 8 and 7 for each row. For row 0, start with 8; row 1, start with 7; row 2, start with 8; row 3, start with 7. The number of elements in each row is 7,5,3,1. \n\nBut how is this determined? The starting element alternates based on the row index. For even rows (0,2), start with 8; for odd rows (1,3), start with 7. \n\nSimilarly, in Example 1, the original 7s are in column 2 for five rows. The diamond would have five rows. \n\nRow 0: starts at position 0 (assuming the pattern is centered around column 2 but expands to the left and right). The first row in Example 1's output is [7,8,7,8,7,8,7,0]. Here, the pattern starts at position 0 with 7, then alternates. But according to the previous logic, row 0 (k=0) would start with 8. But here it starts with 7. So maybe the starting element depends on the column's position and the row index. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the direction of expansion is different. For Example 1's input, the 7s are in column 2. So the center is column 2. The diamond should expand to the left and right. \n\nBut in Example 1's output row 0: [7,8,7,8,7,8,7,0]. The positions are 0-7. Starting at 0, the pattern is 7,8,7,8,7,8,7. The original 7 is at column 2. So position 0 is two positions to the left of 2, which is even distance (2). Maybe the rule is that for each position j in a row, if the distance from j to the center c is d, then the value is 7 if d is even, 8 if d is odd. \n\nFor Example 0's center at 3:\n\nRow 0: j ranges 0-6. The distance from 3 is |j-3|. \n\nj=0: distance 3 \u2192 odd \u2192 8\nj=1: distance 2 \u2192 even \u21927\nj=2: distance 1 \u2192 odd \u21928\nj=3: distance 0 \u2192 even \u21927\nj=4: distance 1 \u2192 odd \u21928\nj=5: distance 2 \u2192 even \u21927\nj=6: distance 3 \u2192 odd \u21928\nWhich matches Example 0's row 0: [8,7,8,7,8,7,8]\n\nFor Example 1's center at 2:\n\nRow 0: positions 0-7. distance from 2 is |j-2|.\n\nj=0: distance 2 \u2192 even \u21927\nj=1: distance 1 \u2192 odd \u21928\nj=2: distance 0 \u2192 even \u21927\nj=3: distance 1 \u2192 odd \u21928\nj=4: distance 2 \u2192 even \u21927\nj=5: distance 3 \u2192 odd \u21928\nj=6: distance 4 \u2192 even \u21927\nj=7: distance 5 \u2192 odd \u21928 \u2192 but in the output, j=7 is 0. \n\nWait, Example 1's output row 0 is [7,8,7,8,7,8,7,0]. So j=7 is 0. That contradicts the pattern. So perhaps this rule is only applied within a certain distance from the center. \n\nAlternatively, the diamond's width is determined by the number of 7s in the input column. For Example 0 with four 7s, the diamond's width is 7 elements (full row), but for Example 1 with five 7s, the width might be larger. But Example 1's input has eight columns, and the output row 0 has seven non-zero elements. \n\nAlternatively, the maximum distance from the center is determined by the number of 7s in the column. For Example 0, four 7s allow a maximum distance of 3 (since 4-1=3), but in row 0, the distance is 3 (j=0 and j=6), which is 3. So that fits. For Example 1, five 7s would allow a maximum distance of 4 (5-1=4), but in the output's first row, j=0 is distance 2 from center 2, and j=6 is distance 4. Hmm, j=0: distance 2, which is even \u21927. j=6: distance 4 \u21927. But in the output row 0 for Example 1, j=6 is 7, j=7 is 0. So the pattern is applied up to a certain distance. \n\nSo the rule could be: For each 7 in the input column, the output's diamond is formed by expanding left and right up to a distance equal to the number of 7s minus 1. Each cell at distance d from the center (where d \u2264 number of 7s -1) is 7 if d is even, 8 if d is odd. Cells beyond that distance are 0.\n\nIn Example 0, four 7s \u2192 max distance 3. So for row 0:\n\nj=0: distance 3 \u2192 8 (3 is odd)\nj=1: distance 2 \u21927\nj=2: distance 1 \u21928\nj=3:0\u21927\n...\nj=6: distance 3 \u21928.\n\nThis matches Example 0's row 0. \n\nIn Example 1, five 7s \u2192 max distance 4. So for row 0 (center 2):\n\nj=0: distance 2 (even) \u21927\nj=1:1 \u21928\nj=2:0\u21927\nj=3:1\u21928\nj=4:2\u21927\nj=5:3\u21928 (since 3 \u22644, but 3 is odd)\nj=6:4\u21927 (4 even)\nj=7:5\u21920 (since 5>4, so set to 0)\n\nWhich would make the row [7,8,7,8,7,8,7,0], matching Example 1's output row 0.\n\nThis seems to fit. Now, how does this apply to the other rows in the output?\n\nFor Example 0's row 1 (output):\n\nThe max distance allowed is 3. But how does the row index affect the distance? Perhaps each row in the diamond has a max distance of (number of 7s -1) - row index. \n\nExample 0 has four 7s, so max distance for row i is (4-1) - i = 3 - i. \n\nRow 0: max distance 3 -0 =3 \u2192 all cells within distance 3 are set according to parity.\nRow 1: max distance 3-1=2 \u2192 cells beyond distance 2 are 0.\nSo in row 1:\n\nj=0: distance 3 \u2192 exceeds max distance 2 \u21920\nj=1: distance 2 \u2192 allowed. even \u21927\nj=2:1 \u21928\nj=3:0\u21927\nj=4:1 \u21928\nj=5:2\u21927\nj=6:3\u21920\nThus, the row becomes [0,7,8,7,8,7,0], which matches Example 0's row 1.\n\nRow 2 of Example 0: max distance 3-2=1. So cells beyond 1 are 0.\n\nj=0:3 \u21920\nj=1:2 \u2192 exceeds max distance 1 \u21920\nj=2:1 \u21928\nj=3:0\u21927\nj=4:1 \u21928\nj=5:2\u21920\nj=6:3\u21920\nResulting in [0,0,8,7,8,0,0], which matches.\n\nRow 3: max distance 3-3=0. Only j=3 is allowed (distance 0 \u21927). Others are 0. So [0,0,0,7,0,0,0], which matches.\n\nSimilarly, in Example 1's output:\n\nNumber of 7s is 5. Max distance for each row i is 5-1 -i =4 -i.\n\nRow 0: max distance 4-0=4 \u2192 j=0 (distance 2 \u22644 \u21927), j=1 (distance 1), etc.\nRow 1: max distance 4-1=3. Cells beyond 3 are 0.\nRow 2: max distance 4-2=2.\nRow 3:4-3=1.\nRow4:4-4=0.\n\nThis would explain the output for Example 1.\n\nSo the pattern is:\n\nFor each cell (i,j) in the output:\n\n- Determine the center column c where the original 7s are located.\n- The max distance allowed for row i is (number_of_7s -1) - i. But wait, the number_of_7s is the number of consecutive 7s in the input column. For example, in Example 0, there are four 7s, so the max distance starts at 3 (4-1) and decreases by 1 each row.\n- For each cell in row i, calculate the distance d from j to c (d = |j -c|).\n- If d \u2264 max_distance, then set the cell to 7 if d is even, 8 if odd.\n- Else, set to 0.\n\nThis seems to fit the examples.\n\nNow, applying this to the test input.\n\nTest Input:\n\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0]\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0]\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0]\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0]\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0]\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0]\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0]\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nThe 7s are in column 5 (0-based index) for seven consecutive rows (rows 0-6). Then two all-zero rows. \n\nSo the number_of_7s is 7. The center column c is 5. The max distance for row i in the diamond is (7-1) -i =6 -i. \n\nEach row in the output up to row 6 will have a max distance of 6-i.\n\nFor example:\n\nRow 0: max distance 6 \u2192 cells within distance 6 from 5 are set. Since the row has 9 columns (indices 0-8), the max distance for row 0 is 6, which allows j from 5-6= -1 (but minimum 0) to 5+6=11 (but max 8). So j ranges from 0 to 8. All cells are within distance 6.\n\nFor each j in row 0:\n\nd = |j -5| \u2192 if d is even \u21927, else \u21928.\n\nj=0:5\u2192d=5 \u2192 odd \u21928\nj=1:4\u2192d=4 \u2192 even \u21927\nj=2:3\u2192d=3 \u2192 odd \u21928\nj=3:2\u2192d=2 \u2192 even \u21927\nj=4:1\u2192d=1 \u2192 odd \u21928\nj=5:0\u2192d=0 \u2192 even \u21927\nj=6:1\u2192d=1 \u2192 odd \u21928\nj=7:2\u2192d=2 \u2192 even \u21927\nj=8:3\u2192d=3 \u2192 odd \u21928\n\nSo row 0 would be [8,7,8,7,8,7,8,7,8]\n\nBut according to the examples, the output might start filling from the left and then have zeros on the right if the max distance is exceeded. Wait, no. Wait, the max distance for row 0 is 6. The max allowed d is 6. For j=0: distance from 5 is 5 (<=6). So yes, it's allowed. j=8: distance 3 (<=6). So all columns are within the max distance. So row 0's output should be [8,7,8,7,8,7,8,7,8].\n\nRow 1: max distance 6-1=5. So any j where |j-5| <=5.\n\nThe row has 9 columns. j ranges from 0 (d=5) to 8 (d=3). All are <=5. So same as row 0, but the starting max distance is 5. Wait, but 5 is the max allowed distance for this row. j=0: distance 5 (<=5). So allowed.\n\nSo row 1's pattern would be similar to row 0's, but starting with 7 and alternating. Wait, no. The parity is based on distance. So for each j:\n\nd= |j-5|. If even \u21927, else \u21928.\n\nFor row 1, j=0: d=5 (odd) \u21928\nj=1:4 (even) \u21927\nj=2:3 (odd) \u21928\nj=3:2 (even) \u21927\nj=4:1 (odd) \u21928\nj=5:0 (even) \u21927\nj=6:1 (odd) \u21928\nj=7:2 (even) \u21927\nj=8:3 (odd) \u21928\n\nSo row 1 would be [8,7,8,7,8,7,8,7,8], same as row 0. But in the training examples, the rows have zeros on the edges as the max distance decreases. \n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake. The max distance for row i is (number_of_7s -1) -i. For Test Input, number_of_7s is 7. So:\n\nRow i from 0 to 6:\n\nRow 0: max distance 6 \u2192 allowed d <=6\nRow 1: max distance 5 \u2192 allowed d <=5\nRow 2: max distance4 \u2192 d <=4\n...\nRow6: max distance0 \u2192 only d=0 allowed.\n\nSo for each row i, cells with d <= (6 -i) are filled with 7/8 based on parity, others are 0.\n\nSo for Test Input:\n\nRow 0 (i=0), max distance 6.\n\nAll j from 5-6= -1 (0) to 5+6=11 (8). So all columns allowed. So row 0 is [8,7,8,7,8,7,8,7,8].\n\nRow1 (i=1), max distance5.\n\nj can be from 5-5=0 to 5+5=10 (8). So all columns. For each j:\n\nd= |j-5|. If <=5: apply parity. For j=0: d=5 (allowed). So same as row 0. Wait, but the max distance is 5, which is exactly the d for j=0. So same as row 0. So row1 would be [8,7,8,7,8,7,8,7,8]. But in the training examples, the rows start to have zeros when the max distance is less than the required.\n\nWait, no. Let's see for Example 0's row 1. The max distance is 3-1=2. So j=0's d=3 (exceeds 2) \u21920. j=1's d=2 (allowed). So the zeros appear when d exceeds the max distance.\n\nIn the Test Input's row 1, j=0: d=5 which is <=5 (allowed). So no zeros. But in Example 1's row 0, j=7 has d=5 (since center is 2: j=7, d=5). But in Example 1's output, j=7 is 0. Wait, because in Example 1, the number_of_7s is5. So max distance for row0 is4 (5-1=4). j=7 in Example1's row0 is d=5 (7-2=5), which exceeds max distance4 \u21920.\n\nAh! So for Test Input's row1 (i=1), max distance is5. j=0: d=5 allowed. j=8: d=3 allowed. So no zeros. So row1 would be same as row0.\n\nRow2 (i=2), max distance4.\n\nj's d must be <=4. j=0: d=5 (exceeds) \u21920. j=1: d=4 \u2192 allowed. So for j=0:0, j=1:4 (even\u21927), j=2:3 (odd\u21928), etc. So:\n\nRow2 starts with 0 (j=0), then j=1 to j=8:\n\nj=1:4 \u21927\nj=2:3 \u21928\nj=3:2 \u21927\nj=4:1 \u21928\nj=5:0 \u21927\nj=6:1 \u21928\nj=7:2 \u21927\nj=8:3 \u21928\n\nSo row2 would be [0,7,8,7,8,7,8,7,8]\n\nSimilarly, row3 (i=3) max distance3.\n\nj's d <=3:\n\nj=0:5-0=5 \u2192 d=5 >3 \u21920\nj=1:4 \u21924>3 \u21920\nj=2:3 \u21923<=3 \u21928 (d=3 is odd)\nj=3:2 \u21927 (even)\nj=4:1 \u21928 (odd)\nj=5:0 \u21927 (even)\nj=6:1 \u21928\nj=7:2 \u21927\nj=8:3 \u21928\n\nSo row3 would be [0,0,8,7,8,7,8,7,8]\n\nRow4 (i=4) max distance2.\n\nj's d <=2:\n\nj=0-5: d=5,4,3,2,1,0 \u2192 only j=3 (d=2), j=4 (d=1), j=5 (d=0), j=6 (d=1), j=7 (d=2), j=8 (d=3>2 \u21920)\n\nSo row4:\n\nj=0:0\nj=1:0\nj=2:0 (d=3>2)\nj=3:2 \u21927 (even)\nj=4:1 \u21928\nj=5:0 \u21927\nj=6:1 \u21928\nj=7:2 \u21927\nj=8:0\n\nSo row4: [0,0,0,7,8,7,8,7,0]\n\nRow5 (i=5) max distance1.\n\nj's d <=1:\n\nj=5-5=0 \u2192 d=0 (7), j=4 and 6 (d=1), j=3 and7 (d=2>1 \u21920), etc.\n\nSo row5:\n\nj=0-2:0\nj=3:0\nj=4:1 \u21928\nj=5:0 \u21927\nj=6:1 \u21928\nj=7:0\nj=8:0\n\nRow5: [0,0,0,0,8,7,8,0,0]\n\nRow6 (i=6) max distance0.\n\nOnly j=5 allowed (d=0 \u21927). Others 0.\n\nRow6: [0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,0]\n\nRows7 and8 are all zeros.\n\nPutting it all together, the output would be:\n\nRow0: [8,7,8,7,8,7,8,7,8]\nRow1: [8,7,8,7,8,7,8,7,8] \u2192 but wait, according to the rules, max distance for row1 is5. But j=0 has d=5 which is allowed, so same as row0. But in Example1's output, row0 and row1 start with 7 and then 8. But according to this rule, they would start with 7 or 8 based on the distance. \n\nBut according to this rule, for Test Input, the first two rows would be the same. But looking back at the training examples:\n\nExample1's input has 5 7s. Row0 of output has [7,8,7,8,7,8,7,0]. The center is column2. d= |j-2|. Max distance for row0 is4.\n\nj=0: d=2 (even \u21927)\nj=1:1 \u21928\nj=2:0 \u21927\nj=3:1 \u21928\nj=4:2 \u21927\nj=5:3 \u21928 (d=3 <=4)\nj=6:4 \u21927 (even)\nj=7:5 \u2192 exceeds 4 \u21920\n\nSo row0 of Example1's output is [7,8,7,8,7,8,7,0], which matches the rule.\n\nThus, the Test Input's rows should follow the same pattern. \n\nSo the final output for the test input would be:\n\nRow0: [8,7,8,7,8,7,8,7,8]\nRow1: [8,7,8,7,8,7,8,7,8] (max distance5, all allowed)\nRow2: [0,7,8,7,8,7,8,7,8] (max distance4, j=0 d=5 \u21920)\nRow3: [0,0,8,7,8,7,8,7,8]\nRow4: [0,0,0,7,8,7,8,7,0]\nRow5: [0,0,0,0,8,7,8,0,0]\nRow6: [0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,0]\nRow7: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\nRow8: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nBut looking at the training examples, in Example1's output, each row after the first starts to lose elements from the right. For example, row0 ends with 7,0. Row1 ends with 0,0. So maybe in the Test Input, after the first row, the max distance decreases, leading to zeros on both ends as needed. \n\nWait, no. According to the rule, the max distance for each row i is (number_of_7s -1) -i. For the Test Input, number_of_7s=7, so max distance for row0 is6, row1 is5, etc.\n\nFor row0, max distance6. So j can be from 5-6= -1 (0) to 5+6=11 (8). All j are allowed. So the entire row is filled.\n\nRow1: max distance5. j can be from 5-5=0 to5+5=10 (8). So all j are allowed. So the entire row is filled.\n\nRow2: max distance4. j can be from5-4=1 to5+4=9 (8). So j starts at1. Thus, j=0 is excluded (distance5).

        "cot_2": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. So, looking at the training examples. \n\nStarting with Example 0. The input has a column of 7s in the middle. The output seems to create a diamond pattern around those 7s. The 7s stay in place, and then there are 8s and 7s alternating around them, forming a sort of expanding diamond shape. The first row of the output has 8,7,8,7,8,7,8. Then each subsequent row has zeros on the edges, and the pattern reduces as we go down. So maybe the 8s are placed around the original 7s in a certain way.\n\nLooking at Example 1. The input has a column of 7s starting from the third position. The output here starts with a row that's 7,8,7,8,7,8,7,0. The next row has one less element on the right, and so on. The pattern here also looks like a diamond but maybe rotated or adjusted based on the position of the original 7s. \n\nSo, the key seems to be that wherever there's a 7 in the input, in the output, it's part of a diamond structure where 7s and 8s alternate. The 8s are added around the original 7s. The number of layers around the 7s might depend on the length of the column of 7s. \n\nIn Example 0, the input is 5 rows, and the output's diamond starts from the top. Maybe each 7 in the input column becomes the center of the diamond, and the diamond expands outward with 8s and 7s alternately. The rows above and below the original 7s get filled with these alternating numbers, decreasing in spread as you move away from the center.\n\nWait, in Example 0, the input has 4 rows with 7s in the middle. The output's first four rows form a diamond shape, with the original 7s at the bottom of the diamond. Then the next row is all zeros. So the diamond is built upwards from the original 7s. Each layer adds a level of 8s and 7s around the existing ones. \n\nFor Example 1, there are 5 rows of 7s in the third column. The output's diamond starts from the top, with each row having one less element at the end. The original 7s are in the third column, so the diamond is built left and right from there. The layers alternate between 7 and 8. \n\nSo perhaps the rule is: for each 7 in the input, create a diamond pattern where each layer alternates between 8 and 7, expanding outward. The depth of the diamond depends on the number of consecutive 7s in the column. \n\nWait, in Example 0, the input has 4 rows of 7s. The output's diamond in that column has 4 layers? Let me check. The output's first row is [8,7,8,7,8,7,8]. The second row is [0,7,8,7,8,7,0]. Third is [0,0,8,7,8,0,0]. Fourth is [0,0,0,7,0,0,0]. So the diamond has layers expanding up from the original 7s. The number of layers might correspond to the number of 7s in the input column. \n\nSimilarly, in Example 1, there are 5 rows of 7s. The output's first row starts with 7,8,7,... and each subsequent row has fewer elements. The layers here start from the top and expand downward? Hmm. Let me count the layers. The output has 5 rows with the original 7s in the third column. The first output row is [7,8,7,8,7,8,7,0], which covers a lot of the row, but then each next row shortens by one on the right and adds a zero. So maybe the depth is determined by the number of 7s, and the pattern is built upwards and downwards.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the position of the 7s in the column dictates the center of the diamond, and the diamond expands outwards in both directions (left and right) from that column. For each 7 in the input, the output creates a diamond where each layer alternates 8 and 7. The vertical position of the 7s in the input determines how the diamond is built vertically.\n\nBut how do the rows in the output relate to the input rows? Let's take the test input. The test input has a column of 7s starting from the 6th position (index 5) in 7 rows. So the input is 9 columns wide. The output needs to create a diamond pattern around that column. \n\nIn Example 0, the 7s were in the 4th column (index 3) of a 5-row input. The output's diamond starts expanding left and right from that column, with each layer adding an 8 and 7 alternately. So for each row in the input that has a 7, the output row starts building the diamond. The number of rows with 7s in the input determines how many layers the diamond has. \n\nWait, Example 0's input has 4 rows of 7s. The output has 4 rows with the diamond structure. Similarly, Example 1's input has 5 rows of 7s, and the output's diamond starts with 5 rows (the first 5 rows of the output). So maybe the number of rows with 7s in the input column determines the number of layers in the diamond. Each of those rows contributes a layer. \n\nSo, for the test input, there are 7 rows with 7s in column 5 (0-based index 5). So the diamond should have 7 layers. The center of the diamond would be column 5, and the layers would expand left and right, alternating 8 and 7. \n\nLet me try to model this. For each row in the input that has a 7 in column x, the corresponding row in the output starts building the diamond. The first row (topmost with a 7) would have the widest spread. Each subsequent row would decrease the spread by 1 on each side. The values alternate starting with 8 or 7 depending on the direction. \n\nWait, in Example 0, the first output row is [8,7,8,7,8,7,8]. The 7s are in the middle. So starting from the center 7, each layer alternates between 8 and 7. The first layer (center) is 7, then 8 on either side, then 7, then 8, etc. \n\nWait, the first row's pattern is 8,7,8,7,8,7,8. So the center is 7 (position 3), then positions 2 and 4 are 8, positions 1 and 5 are 7, positions 0 and 6 are 8. Hmm, that's a bit different. It alternates starting with 8 on the ends. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that each layer alternates between 8 and 7 as you move away from the center. So the center is 7, then next layer is 8, then 7, etc. \n\nBut in Example 0's output, the first row (top) has the pattern 8,7,8,7,8,7,8. So the center is 7, and each step left and right alternates between 8 and 7. Starting from the center, left and right are 8, then 7, then 8. \n\nWait, the sequence from center outward would be 7 (center), then 8 on both sides, then 7, then 8. So positions 3 (7), 2 and 4 (8), 1 and 5 (7), 0 and 6 (8). That's exactly what's in the first row of Example 0's output. So the pattern alternates starting with 8 as the first layer around 7. \n\nSo the rule is: for each row in the input that has a 7 in column x, the corresponding row in the output is built by placing 7 at x, and then expanding outward, alternating 8 and 7. The number of layers (how far to expand) depends on the row's position in the original 7 column. \n\nWait, but in Example 0, the input's 7s are in rows 0 to 3 (assuming 0-based rows). The output's first row (row 0) has the widest spread. Then each subsequent row has a smaller spread. So perhaps the topmost row in the input's 7 column corresponds to the widest layer in the output. Each next row down in the input's 7 column adds a layer that's one step smaller. \n\nSo for the test input, which has 7 rows with 7s (rows 0 to 6 in column 5), the output would start with the widest layer in row 0, then row 1 would be narrower, etc. Each of these rows contributes to building the diamond. \n\nLet's test this with Example 1. The input's 7s are in rows 0-4 (5 rows) of column 2. The output's first row (row 0) has a spread from column 0 to 6 (7 elements: 7,8,7,8,7,8,7). Then row 1 has spread from 0 to 5 (7,8,7,8,7,8,0). Wait, maybe not. Let's look at the actual output. \n\nExample 1's output rows:\n\nRow 0: [7,8,7,8,7,8,7,0] (columns 0-6)\nRow 1: [7,8,7,8,7,8,0,0] (columns 0-5)\nRow 2: [7,8,7,8,7,0,0,0] (columns 0-4)\nRow 3: [0,8,7,8,0,0,0,0] (columns 1-3)\nRow 4: [0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0] (column 2 only)\nRows 5 and 6: all zeros.\n\nSo each row in the output corresponds to the same row in the input, which had a 7. The first row (row 0) in the output has the widest spread, then each subsequent row (rows 1,2,3,4) have a narrower spread. \n\nSo the pattern is that for each row in the input that has a 7 in column x, the output row is built by expanding outward from x, creating a diamond layer. The maximum spread for the top row (row 0) is the number of 7 rows minus 1. Then each subsequent row reduces the spread by 1 on each side. \n\nWait, in Example 0's input, there are 4 rows with 7s. The output's first row has a spread of 3 (from center 3 to 0 and 6, which is 3 steps each way). Then each next row reduces by 1 step. So 4 rows of 7s would result in 4 layers of spread: 3, 2, 1, 0 (maybe). \n\nIn Example 0, the first output row has spread 3 (positions 0-6, center at 3). Then row 1 has spread 2 (positions 1-5), row 2 spread 1 (positions 2-4), row 3 spread 0 (only position 3). \n\nYes, that's matching. So for n rows of 7s in the input, each output row corresponding to those 7s has a spread of (n - 1 - i) steps from the center, where i is the row index in the input's 7 rows (starting from 0). \n\nSo for each input row j (which has a 7), the spread is (n - 1 - (j - first_row)), but maybe it's easier to think in terms of the number of layers. \n\nAlternatively, the number of 7 rows determines the maximum spread. For m rows of 7s, the maximum spread is m-1. Then each subsequent row decreases the spread by 1. \n\nWait, in Example 0, m=4 rows of 7s. The maximum spread is 3 (so 3 steps left and right from the center). Then each next row has spread 2, 1, 0. \n\nIn Example 1, m=5 rows. So maximum spread is 4. Let's see the first output row: starts at column 0 and goes to 6 (7 elements). The center is column 2. The spread is from 0 to 6 (distance 2 from center on left and 4 on right? Wait, perhaps the spread is calculated as the number of steps. For maximum spread s, the leftmost position is center - s, and rightmost is center + s. \n\nIn Example 1's first output row, center is 2. The spread s would be 4 (since m=5, s =5-1=4?), but then leftmost would be 2-4= -2, which doesn't make sense. Wait, maybe I'm miscalculating. \n\nWait, perhaps the spread for each row in the output is determined by the row's position relative to the input's 7 rows. For example, the first row with a 7 in the input is the topmost, and in the output, that row has the maximum spread. Then each subsequent row (downwards) in the input's 7 rows has a spread reduced by 1. \n\nIn Example 0, input has 4 rows of 7s. So the first row (row 0) in the input's 7 rows has spread 3 (since 4 rows: 3, 2, 1, 0). The next row (row 1 in input's 7 rows) has spread 2, etc. \n\nBut looking at Example 0's output:\n\nRow 0: spread 3 (from center 3: 3-3=0 to 3+3=6) \u2192 indices 0-6, which is 7 elements. So spread s=3.\n\nRow 1: spread 2 (indices 1-5).\n\nRow 2: spread 1 (indices 2-4).\n\nRow 3: spread 0 (only index 3).\n\nSo for m=4 rows, the spread starts at 3 and decreases by 1 per row.\n\nSimilarly, in Example 1, m=5 rows. So the first row's spread is 4, then 3, 2, 1, 0.\n\nBut in Example 1's output, the first row (row 0) has elements from column 0 to 6 (indices 0-6), which is a spread of 6 columns. The center is column 2. 2 + 4 =6, 2-4= -2. Wait, that doesn't add up. Wait, maybe the spread is not s, but the maximum left and right steps.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the spread is determined by the number of 7 rows minus the row index. For the i-th row in the input's 7 rows (starting from 0), the spread is (m-1) - i. \n\nIn Example 0, m=4. For i=0, spread=3; i=1\u21922; i=2\u21921; i=3\u21920. Which matches.\n\nIn Example 1, m=5. For i=0, spread=4; i=1\u21923; i=2\u21922; i=3\u21921; i=4\u21920. Let's see:\n\nRow 0 (i=0) in output has spread 4. Center is column 2. So leftmost is 2-4= -2, but that's not possible. Wait, perhaps the spread is actually the maximum possible given the row's position. Maybe the spread is limited by the row's position. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the spread is such that the first row (top) has the maximum possible spread that fits in the grid. For Example 1, the first output row's spread is 3 steps left (from column 2 to 0) and 4 steps right (from 2 to 6). But that's a total of 7 elements. So maybe the spread is determined by how far it can go from the center without going out of bounds. But that complicates things. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the spread is calculated as m-1 - row_index_in_7_rows. So for Example 1, which has 5 rows of 7s (rows 0-4 in input), the spread for each output row would be:\n\nRow 0: 5-1 -0=4.\n\nRow 1:5-1 -1=3.\n\nRow 2:5-1-2=2.\n\nRow3:5-1-3=1.\n\nRow4:5-1-4=0.\n\nBut when we apply this, for row 0, spread is 4. Center is column 2. So leftmost would be 2-4= -2, which is impossible. So maybe the spread is clamped to the left and right boundaries. But in Example 1's output, the first row starts at column 0. So maybe the spread is allowed to be as much as possible, but truncated to the grid's edges. \n\nIn Example 1's first output row, the spread is 4 steps left and right. But column 2 -4 steps left is column -2, which is invalid. So perhaps the actual spread is min(steps, available space). So the left spread is min(steps, center_column). And the right spread is min(steps, (total_columns-1 - center_column)).\n\nBut in Example 1's case, center is column 2. The left spread is min(4, 2) =2 steps left (to column 0). The right spread is min(4, (7-2))=5 steps (since total columns in input are 8, so indices 0-7). Wait, in Example 1's input, each row has 8 elements. So for center 2, the right spread can be up to 5 steps (columns 2+5=7). So total spread would be 2 left steps and 5 right steps. But in the output, the first row's spread is from column 0 to 6. That's 7 elements (0-6 inclusive). So the actual spread is left 2 (2 steps from center 2 to 0) and right 4 (from 2 to 6). Wait, 2 to 6 is 4 steps (columns 3,4,5,6). So perhaps the spread is the same on both sides, but limited by the grid's edges. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the spread is applied symmetrically as much as possible. So for a spread s, the left and right steps are s, but if the left can't go that far (e.g., center -s is negative), then left steps are limited. Similarly for the right.\n\nBut in Example 1's first output row, the spread from center 2 is 4 steps. Left would be 2 steps (to column 0), right would be 4 steps (to column 6). So the total elements would be 7 (columns 0-6). Which matches the output. So the spread is 4 steps right, but only 2 left. Then for the next row, spread is 3 steps. So left steps would be min(3, 2) =2, right steps 3. So left to 0, right to 5 (columns 0-5). Which matches the second row in Example 1's output. \n\nSo the pattern is: for each row in the input's 7 column, the spread is (m-1 - i) steps, where m is the number of rows with 7s, and i is the row index (starting from 0). The left steps are min(spread, center_column), and right steps are min(spread, (total_columns -1 - center_column)). \n\nThen, for each position in the output row, the value alternates between 8 and 7, starting with 8 at the furthest points. \n\nSo for each row in the input's 7 rows, the output row is built as follows:\n\n- The center is the column of the 7s (x).\n- For each position in the row, calculate the distance from x (dx = |current_col - x|).\n- If dx <= spread, then the value is 8 if dx is even, 7 if dx is odd.\n- Else, the value is 0.\n\nWait, let's check this.\n\nIn Example 0's first output row (spread=3):\n\ndistance 0 \u21927 (center) \u21927.\n\ndistance 1 \u21928, 7, 8, 7, 8, 7, 8. \n\nWait, the first row is [8,7,8,7,8,7,8]. The center is index 3 (dx=0). The positions are:\n\ndx for each position:\n\n0: |0-3|=3 \u2192 spread is 3. So included. 3 is odd \u21927? But in the output, it's 8. Hmm, maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, the value alternates starting from the center. The center is 7. Then each step outward alternates between 8 and 7. So:\n\ndx=0 \u21927.\n\ndx=1 \u21928.\n\ndx=2 \u21927.\n\ndx=3 \u21928.\n\nSo for the first row in Example 0, the positions are:\n\npositions 0 (dx=3) \u21928.\n\n1 (dx=2) \u21927.\n\n2 (dx=1) \u21928.\n\n3 (dx=0) \u21927.\n\n4 (dx=1) \u21928.\n\n5 (dx=2) \u21927.\n\n6 (dx=3) \u21928.\n\nWhich matches the output [8,7,8,7,8,7,8]. So the rule is:\n\nFor dx from 0 to spread:\n\n- if dx is even \u21927.\n\n- if dx is odd \u21928.\n\nBut the center is dx=0 (even \u21927). Then dx=1 (odd \u21928), dx=2 (even \u21927), dx=3 (odd \u21928). \n\nYes, that's exactly what's happening. So the value at a position is 7 if the distance from the center is even, and 8 if odd. \n\nSo putting it all together:\n\nFor each row in the input that has a 7 in column x:\n\n1. Determine the spread s = (m-1 - i), where m is the number of rows with 7s, and i is the row index (starting from 0).\n\n2. For each column in the output row:\n\n   a. Calculate dx = |current_col - x|.\n\n   b. If dx <= s and dx is even \u21927.\n\n   c. If dx <= s and dx is odd \u21928.\n\n   d. Else \u21920.\n\nNow apply this to the test input.\n\nTest Input:\n\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0]\n\nRepeated for 7 rows (rows 0-6), then two rows of zeros. The 7s are in column 5 (0-based index 5). The number of rows with 7s is m=7. Each row in the input's 7 rows (rows 0-6) will have a spread s=7-1 - i =6 -i.\n\nSo for each row i in 0-6:\n\ns =6 -i.\n\nNow, for each of these rows in the output:\n\n- The center is column 5.\n\n- For each column in the row:\n\n   dx = |current_col -5|.\n\n   if dx <= s:\n\n      if dx even \u21927.\n\n      else \u21928.\n\n   else:\n\n      0.\n\nLet's construct the output rows.\n\nTest Input has 9 columns (indices 0-8).\n\nLet's start with row 0 (i=0, s=6-0=6):\n\ns=6. So dx can be up to 6.\n\nFor each column:\n\nColumns 0-8:\n\ndx for column c: |c-5|.\n\nWe need to check if dx <=6 (yes for all c, since max dx is 5-0=5, 8-5=3. Wait, 5 to 8 is 3, so dx=3. Wait, 5 is the center. So the max dx possible in 9 columns is 8-5=3 (for c=8) and 5-0=5 (for c=0). So s=6, but the actual dx can't exceed 5. So for all columns, dx <=5, which is <=6. So all columns are included.\n\nSo for row 0:\n\neach column c:\n\ndx = |c-5|\n\nvalue is 7 if dx even, 8 if odd.\n\nLet's compute:\n\nc=0: dx=5 (odd \u21928)\n\nc=1: dx=4 (even \u21927)\n\nc=2: dx=3 (odd \u21928)\n\nc=3: dx=2 (even \u21927)\n\nc=4: dx=1 (odd \u21928)\n\nc=5: dx=0 (even \u21927)\n\nc=6: dx=1 (odd \u21928)\n\nc=7: dx=2 (even \u21927)\n\nc=8: dx=3 (odd \u21928)\n\nSo row 0 would be [8,7,8,7,8,7,8,7,8].\n\nBut wait, the test input's rows are 9 columns, so the output row would be [8,7,8,7,8,7,8,7,8].\n\nThen row 1 (i=1, s=6-1=5).\n\nNow, s=5. For dx <=5. Since the maximum possible dx is 5 (c=0), which is allowed.\n\nCompute values:\n\nc=0: dx=5 (odd \u21928)\n\nc=1: dx=4 (even \u21927)\n\nc=2: dx=3 (odd \u21928)\n\nc=3: dx=2 (even \u21927)\n\nc=4: dx=1 (odd \u21928)\n\nc=5: dx=0 (7)\n\nc=6: dx=1 (8)\n\nc=7: dx=2 (7)\n\nc=8: dx=3 (8) but dx=3 <=5 \u2192 yes. So c=8 is 8.\n\nWait, but s=5. So dx=5 is allowed. For c=8, dx=3 <=5 \u2192 yes. So all columns except none? So row 1 would be [8,7,8,7,8,7,8,7,8], but wait, no. Wait, for row 1, s=5, but the actual dx can be up to 5. But for c=0, dx=5 is allowed, which is even? No, dx=5 is odd. So c=0 is 8. \n\nBut maybe the spread s is the maximum allowed steps from the center. But in this case, with s=5, but the actual dx can be up to 5. For example, c=0 is dx=5 (s=5 \u2192 allowed). So row 1 would have:\n\nc0:5 \u21928\n\nc1:4\u21927\n\nc2:3\u21928\n\nc3:2\u21927\n\nc4:1\u21928\n\nc5:0\u21927\n\nc6:1\u21928\n\nc7:2\u21927\n\nc8:3\u21928\n\nSo row 1 is [8,7,8,7,8,7,8,7,8]. But this is the same as row 0, which can't be right. Because in Example 1's first two rows, the spread decreases by 1. So perhaps I'm making a mistake here. \n\nWait, no. For Example 1, the first row has spread 4 (m=5, i=0: s=4). Then row 1 has s=3. But in the output, row 1 ends one column earlier. So perhaps when the spread decreases, the furthest columns are set to zero. \n\nAh, perhaps the spread determines how far from the center the pattern extends. So for s=6 in row 0, but the actual dx can't exceed 5 (since center is 5 in a 9-column row). So in row 0, s=6, but the maximum possible dx is 5, which is <=6, so all columns are processed. \n\nFor row 1, s=5. The same applies. So all columns are included, but the pattern remains the same. Wait, that can't be. There must be a mistake here. \n\nLooking back at Example 1's output. The input is 8 columns. The first output row (row 0) has elements from column 0 to 6, and the last column is 0. So for s=4 (m=5 rows, i=0 \u2192s=4). The center is column 2. \n\ndx = |c-2|. For row 0, s=4. So any c where dx <=4.\n\nFor c=7 (original columns are 0-7), dx=5 (7-2=5) which is >4 \u21920. So the last element is 0. \n\nAh, right! So in Example 1's row 0, the spread s=4. For center 2, the allowed dx is up to 4. So columns where |c-2| <=4 are included. \n\nFor c=0: dx=2 (0-2=2) \u2192 included. \n\nc=7: dx=5 \u2192 excluded \u21920.\n\nSo the first row in Example 1's output has 7 elements (columns 0-6), then 0 for column 7.\n\nSo the spread s determines the maximum allowed dx. For the test input's row 0, s=6. But the maximum dx possible is 5 (c=0, dx=5). So dx <=6 \u2192 allowed. So all columns are included. \n\nFor row 1, s=5. Again, dx up to 5. c=0 has dx=5, which is allowed. So all columns are included, but the pattern changes based on s. Wait, no. Because when s decreases, the allowed dx is smaller. Wait, no. s is the maximum allowed dx. \n\nWait, no. For example, if s=5, then dx can be up to 5. For the test input's row 1 (s=5), the center is 5. For c=0, dx=5 \u2192 allowed. So all columns are included. \n\nBut then why in Example 1's row 1, the spread is s=3, but the last element is 0. Because in Example 1's row 1 (i=1, s=3), center is 2. For c=5: dx=3 \u2192 allowed. For c=6: dx=4 \u2192 which is >3 \u21920. So the last element in row 1 is 0. \n\nAh, I see. So the key is that s is the maximum allowed dx. So for a given row, any column with dx (distance from center) <=s is filled with 7/8, otherwise 0. \n\nSo for the test input's row 0 (s=6), all columns have dx <=5, which is <=6 \u2192 all included. \n\nRow 0: [8,7,8,7,8,7,8,7,8]\n\nRow 1: s=5 \u2192 any dx <=5. All columns have dx <=5 \u2192 all included. So same as row 0? But that's not matching the training examples. \n\nWait, no. Let's take Example 0's row 1. s=2. So dx must be <=2. \n\nIn Example 0's output row 1: [0,7,8,7,8,7,0]. The center is 3. So columns 1: dx=2 (<=2), column 5: dx=2. Columns 0 and 6 have dx=3 and 3, which are >2 \u21920. \n\nSo for s=2, columns 0 and 6 are 0. \n\nSo for the test input's row 1 (s=5), dx can be up to 5. For columns 0 (dx=5), 1 (dx=4), 8 (dx=3). All <=5 \u2192 included. So row 1 would have the same pattern as row 0. But in Example 1's row 1, when s decreases, the pattern changes. \n\nThis suggests that there's another factor at play. Maybe the number of rows with 7s determines the maximum possible spread, but each row's spread is determined by its position in the input's 7 rows. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the spread is not m-1 -i, but the row's position in the input's 7 rows determines how far the pattern spreads. For example, in Example 0, the first row (topmost 7) has the largest spread, and each subsequent row reduces the spread by 1. \n\nBut in the test case, with 7 rows of 7s, the first row would have spread 6, then 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0. \n\nBut the maximum possible dx from center 5 is 5 (for c=0). So for s=6, the dx can be up to 6, but the actual maximum dx is 5, so all columns are included. \n\nSo for each row in the test input's 7 rows:\n\nRow i (0-6):\n\ns =6 -i.\n\nThen for each column:\n\ndx = |c -5|.\n\nIf dx <= s \u2192 7 if even, 8 if odd.\n\nElse \u21920.\n\nLet's proceed to construct each row.\n\nRow 0 (i=0, s=6):\n\ndx can be up to 6. But in reality, max dx is 5 (c=0:5-0=5). So all columns are included.\n\nValues:\n\nc0:5 \u2192 odd \u21928\n\nc1:4 \u2192 even \u21927\n\nc2:3 \u2192 odd \u21928\n\nc3:2 \u2192 even \u21927\n\nc4:1 \u2192 odd \u21928\n\nc5:0 \u2192 even \u21927\n\nc6:1 \u2192 odd \u21928\n\nc7:2 \u2192 even \u21927\n\nc8:3 \u2192 odd \u21928\n\nSo row 0: [8,7,8,7,8,7,8,7,8]\n\nRow 1 (i=1, s=5):\n\ns=5. dx <=5.\n\nAll columns included, since max dx is 5 (c=0). \n\nSame calculation as row 0. So row 1: same as row 0.\n\nWait, but this would mean that rows 0 and 1 are the same, which doesn't align with the training examples. For instance, in Example 0's rows 0 and 1, the spread decreases by 1, leading to different patterns. \n\nHmm, I must have made a mistake. Let's re-examine Example 0's rows:\n\nExample 0's input has 4 rows of 7s. So m=4.\n\nFor row 0 (i=0), s=3.\n\nRow 0: spread 3 \u2192 dx <=3.\n\nColumns 0-6 (dx 3, 2, 1, 0, 1, 2, 3).\n\nValues: 8,7,8,7,8,7,8.\n\nRow 1 (i=1), s=2 \u2192 dx <=2.\n\nColumns 1-5 (dx 2,1,0,1,2). The first and last columns are dx=3 and 3 \u21920.\n\nSo row 1: 0,7,8,7,8,7,0.\n\nBut in the test case's row 1 (s=5), which allows dx up to 5, which includes all columns. So the values are the same as row 0. \n\nBut this would mean that for the test case, the first two rows are the same. But looking at the training examples, each subsequent row has a smaller spread. So perhaps there's a different formula for the spread. \n\nMaybe the spread is calculated as (m - i -1), but in Example 0, m=4 rows, so for i=0, spread=3; i=1\u21922; i=2\u21921; i=3\u21920. Which works. \n\nIn the test case, m=7 rows. So for i=0, spread=6; i=1\u21925; i=2\u21924; ... i=6\u21920.\n\nBut when spread is 6, and the maximum dx is 5 (from center 5 to column 0), then all columns are included. \n\nBut when spread is 5 (i=1), same as above. \n\nThis suggests that for the first few rows (i=0 to i=5), the spread is larger than the maximum possible dx (which is 5), so all columns are included, leading to the same pattern. \n\nBut that can't be right. In the training example 1, when m=5 rows, row i=0 has spread 4, but the output's first row includes up to column 6 (dx=4 from center 2: 2-4= -2, but clamped to 0). So for the test case, perhaps the spread is capped by the available columns. \n\nWait, the spread is the maximum allowed distance from the center, but if the actual distance exceeds the available columns, then it's clamped. \n\nFor the test case's row i=0, s=6. The maximum dx is 5 (from center 5 to column 0). So even though s=6, the actual spread is 5. So the rule is: the spread is the minimum of s and the maximum possible dx in either direction. \n\nBut this complicates things. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the spread is s steps on each side. So for s=6, the left spread is 6 steps from center 5: 5-6= -1 (which is invalid, so left spread is 5 steps to column 0). Right spread is 6 steps: 5+6=11, which is beyond the 8th column (index 8), so right spread is 3 steps to column 8. So the left spread is 5, right is 3. But this would mean that the pattern is not symmetrical, which contradicts the training examples. \n\nThis seems to be getting too complicated. Perhaps the initial approach is correct, and the test case's rows 0-5 will have the same pattern, but that's unlikely given the training examples. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the spread is calculated as the number of rows with 7s minus the row index, but then multiplied by 2 plus 1. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the pattern is that each row in the input's 7 column creates a diamond layer where the number of elements increases until the middle row, then decreases. \n\nBut given the time I've spent, perhaps I should proceed to apply the initial rule and see if it matches the expected output.\n\nSo applying the rule:\n\nFor each row in the input's 7 column (7 rows in test case), the output row is built with s=6-i.\n\nFor each column, dx = |c-5|.\n\nIf dx <= s \u21927 if even, 8 if odd.\n\nElse 0.\n\nSo for row 0 (s=6):\n\nAll columns included. So [8,7,8,7,8,7,8,7,8].\n\nRow 1 (s=5):\n\nAll columns included. Same as row 0.\n\nRow 2 (s=4):\n\ndx <=4.\n\nFor c=0, dx=5 >4 \u21920.\n\nc=1, dx=4 \u2192 even \u21927.\n\nc=2, dx=3 \u2192 odd \u21928.\n\nc=3, dx=2 \u2192 even \u21927.\n\nc=4, dx=1 \u2192 odd \u21928.\n\nc=5 \u21927.\n\nc=6 \u21928.\n\nc=7 \u21927.\n\nc=8 \u21928.\n\nSo row 2: [0,7,8,7,8,7,8,7,8].\n\nRow 3 (s=3):\n\ndx <=3.\n\nc=0:5 \u2192>3 \u21920.\n\nc=1:4 \u2192>3 \u21920.\n\nc=2:3 \u2192 yes \u21928.\n\nc=3:2 \u21927.\n\nc=4:1 \u21928.\n\nc5:7.\n\nc6:8.\n\nc7:2 \u21927.\n\nc8:3 \u21928.\n\nSo row 3: [0,0,8,7,8,7,8,7,8].\n\nRow 4 (s=2):\n\ndx <=2.\n\nc0-1:dx>2 \u21920.\n\nc2:3\u2192>2 \u21920.\n\nc3:2 \u21927.\n\nc4:1 \u21928.\n\nc5:7.\n\nc6:1 \u21928.\n\nc7:2 \u21927.\n\nc8:3\u2192>2 \u21920.\n\nSo row 4: [0,0,0,7,8,7,8,0,0].\n\nRow 5 (s=1):\n\ndx <=1.\n\nOnly columns where dx is 0 or 1.\n\nc4,5,6:dx=1,0,1 \u21928,7,8.\n\nOthers are 0.\n\nSo row 5: [0,0,0,0,8,7,8,0,0].\n\nRow 6 (s=0):\n\ndx <=0 \u2192 only column 5.\n\nSo row 6: [0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,0].\n\nRows 7 and 8 in the input are all zeros, so output rows 7 and 8 are all zeros.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nRow 0: [8,7,8,7,8,7,8,7,8]\n\nRow 1: [8,7,8,7,8,7,8,7,8]\n\nRow 2: [0,7,8,7,8,7,8,7,8]\n\nRow 3: [0,0,8,7,8,7,8,7,8]\n\nRow 4: [0,0,0,7,8,7,8,0,0]\n\nRow 5: [0,0,0,0,8,7,8,0,0]\n\nRow 6: [0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,0]\n\nRow 7: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow 8: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nBut looking at the training examples, the output layers get smaller as we go down. For Example 0, the top row is the widest. So the test case's output should follow the same pattern. However, in the current calculation, rows 0 and 1 have the same pattern, which doesn't seem right. \n\nPerhaps the mistake is in how the spread is calculated. Maybe the spread is (m - i -1), where m is the number of rows, but the spread is actually the number of layers outward. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the spread is calculated as the number of rows below the current row. For example, the top row has the most layers. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the spread is the number of rows remaining in the input's 7 rows, including the current row. \n\nBut given the time constraints, perhaps this is the correct answer. Let's compare with the training examples. \n\nIn Example 0's output, the first row has the widest spread, and each row below reduces the spread by one. So the test case's output should have a similar structure. However, according to the current calculation, the first two rows are the same. This seems off. \n\nWait, in the test case's row 0, s=6, and row 1, s=5. But since the maximum dx is 5, both s=6 and s=5 allow all columns. So rows 0 and 1 have the same pattern. This is possible. For example, in Example 1, row 0 has s=4, and row 1 has s=3. The first row includes more columns to the right, but in the test case, all columns are included in the first two rows. \n\nSo the final output would have the first two rows identical, then each subsequent row starts to have zeros on the left. \n\nBut let's verify with the test input's row 2 (s=4):\n\ndx <=4. For c=0, dx=5 \u2192 excluded (0). c=1, dx=4 \u2192 included (7). c=8, dx=3 \u2192 included. So row 2: [0,7,8,7,8,7,8,7,8].\n\nRow 3: s=3. dx <=3. c=0:5 \u21920. c=1:4 \u21920. c=2:3 \u21928. c=8:3 \u21928. So row 3: [0,0,8,7,8,7,8,7,8].\n\nRow 4: s=2. dx <=2. c=3:2 \u21927. c=7:2 \u21927. So row 4: [0,0,0,7,8,7,8,7,0]?\n\nWait, no. Let's redo row 4:\n\ns=2. i=4.\n\ndx <=2.\n\nFor each column:\n\nc0:5 \u2192dx=5>2 \u21920.\n\nc1:4 \u2192dx=4>2 \u21920.\n\nc2:3 \u2192dx=3>2 \u21920.\n\nc3:2 \u2192dx=2 \u21927.\n\nc4:1 \u2192dx=1 \u21928.\n\nc5:0 \u21927.\n\nc6:1 \u21928.\n\nc7:2 \u21927.\n\nc8:3 \u2192dx=3>2 \u21920.\n\nSo row 4: [0,0,0,7,8,7,8,7,0].\n\nBut according to earlier calculation, I had [0,0,0,7,8,7,8,0,0]. Which is incorrect. Wait, no:\n\nc7: dx=|7-5|=2 \u2192 yes. So value is even \u21927.\n\nc8: dx=3>2 \u21920.\n\nSo row 4: columns 3-7 are 7,8,7,8,7. The rest are 0. So:\n\n[0,0,0,7,8,7,8,7,0]\n\nBut in my earlier calculation I had [0,0,0,7,8,7,8,0,0]. That was a mistake. \n\nSo row 4 should be [0,0,0,7,8,7,8,7,0].\n\nBut according to the training examples, as we go down, the spread decreases symmetrically. So perhaps there's a mistake in the way the spread is being applied. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the spread is applied symmetrically, but for even and odd s, the pattern adjusts. \n\nBut given the time, I'll proceed with the current pattern and format the answer accordingly."
