        "cot_1": "Okay, let's see. I need to figure out the pattern from the training examples and apply it to the test input. Let me start by looking at the training examples one by one.\n\nLooking at Example 0:\n\nThe input has four arrays. The output has three arrays each with three elements. So maybe each output array corresponds to a comparison between consecutive input arrays? Let's check.\n\nInput arrays for Example 0:\n\nRow 0: [5,5,5,5,0,5,5,5,5,0,5,5,5,5]\nRow 1: [5,5,5,5,0,5,0,0,5,0,0,5,5,0]\nRow 2: [5,5,5,5,0,5,0,0,5,0,0,5,5,0]\nRow 3: [5,5,5,5,0,5,5,5,5,0,5,5,5,5]\n\nOutput is three arrays: [2,2,2], [8,8,8], [3,3,3]\n\nHmm. Since there are four input rows, maybe the three outputs are comparing each consecutive pair. So rows 0-1, 1-2, 2-3.\n\nWait, but the output has three arrays, each with three elements. How does that relate?\n\nAlternatively, maybe each output array corresponds to each of the three gaps between the four input arrays, and the elements in the output arrays represent some count or transformation.\n\nLooking at the first output [2,2,2]. Let's compare rows 0 and 1. Let's look for where the elements differ.\n\nRow 0: 5,5,5,5,0,5,5,5,5,0,5,5,5,5\n\nRow 1:5,5,5,5,0,5,0,0,5,0,0,5,5,0\n\nComparing element by element:\n\nPositions where row0 and row1 differ:\n\nAt index 6: 5 vs 0\n\nIndex 7:5 vs0\n\nIndex 10:5 vs0\n\nIndex 13:5 vs0\n\nSo four differences. But the output is [2,2,2]. Hmm, that doesn't match. Wait maybe not the number of differences. Alternatively, maybe the sum of certain parts.\n\nLooking at the structure of the input arrays. Each array has 14 elements. Maybe divided into groups? Let's see. For example, maybe split into 3 groups, but 14 isn't divisible by 3. Alternatively, maybe each array represents a 7x2 grid, but not sure.\n\nWait, let's look for the positions of 0s. In row 0, the 0s are at positions 4 and 9. In row1, 0s are at positions 4,6,7,9,10,13. So maybe the 0s are representing some structure.\n\nAlternatively, considering that the output arrays have three elements each, maybe each element in the output array represents some count in three different regions of the input arrays. Like splitting each input array into three parts and counting something.\n\nFor example, in Example0's output [2,2,2], maybe each part contributes 2. Let's check.\n\nTake row0 and row1. If we split each into three parts. Let's see: 14 elements. 14 divided by 3 is roughly 4 or 5 per part. Alternatively, maybe 4,4,6 or other splits. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each 0 in the input arrays represents a break, and the 5s are segments. Like the 0s are separators. For instance, in row0 of Example0, the 0s are at positions 4 and 9. So splitting the array into three parts:\n\nFirst part: positions 0-4 (but since position4 is 0, maybe it's the end of the first segment). So maybe the first segment is positions 0-3 (four 5s), then a 0, then next segment from 5 to 8 (four 5s), then a 0, then positions 10-13 (four 5s). So three segments each of four 5s, separated by 0s.\n\nIn row1 of Example0: 0s at positions4,6,7,9,10,13. So the structure is:\n\npositions0-3: four 5s, then 0. Then position5 is 5, but positions6-7 are 0s. Then position8 is 5, position9 is 0, positions10-12: 0,5,5. Position13 is 0.\n\nHmm, maybe the segments are between the 0s. Like each segment is a group of 5s between 0s. So in row0, there are three segments (as before). In row1, maybe the segments are:\n\nAfter position4 (0), the next part starts at position5 (5), but then there's 0s at 6 and 7. So maybe the next segment is position5 (5), then 0 at6. So segment from 5 to5 (just one 5). Then another 0 at6,7. Then next segment starts at8 (5), then 0 at9. Then next starts at10 (0?), but that's 0. Hmm, maybe not. Alternatively, maybe the number of segments is the number of runs of 5s between 0s. Let's see row1:\n\nRow1: 5,5,5,5,0,5,0,0,5,0,0,5,5,0\n\nBreaking into runs between 0s:\n\nFirst run: positions0-3: 5s, then 0.\n\nThen next starts at5 (after the 0 at4). So 5 (position5), then 0 at6. So that's a run of 1.\n\nThen after 0s at6,7, next run starts at8:5, then 0 at9. So that's a run of 1.\n\nThen after 0 at9, next 0 at10. So no 5s here. Then at11:5,5, then 0 at13. So run of 2.\n\nSo the segments would be lengths 4,1,1,2. But how does this relate to the output [2,2,2]?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is the counts of the number of 5s in each segment between 0s, but grouped into three parts. But the example's output is [2,2,2]. So maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, the output could represent the number of segments of 5s of a certain length. For example, in row0, each segment is 4 5s, so maybe that's not directly it.\n\nWait, let's look at the output of Example0's OUTPUT: [2,2,2], [8,8,8], [3,3,3]. These numbers sum to 6, 24, 9. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the outputs are the sums of certain positions. Let's check the first output of Example0: [2,2,2]. Let's take the differences between row0 and row1. Let's see:\n\nRow0: [5,5,5,5,0,5,5,5,5,0,5,5,5,5]\n\nRow1: [5,5,5,5,0,5,0,0,5,0,0,5,5,0]\n\nThe positions where row0 and row1 differ are indices 6,7,10,13. So four differences. But the output is [2,2,2]. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the sum of the differences. For each differing position, subtract row1 from row0. So 5-0=5 at each of the four positions. So total of 5*4=20. But the output is 2,2,2. Not matching.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is the count of 0s in each part. For example, in row0, there are two 0s (positions4 and9). In row1, there are six 0s. But the output is three arrays, each with three elements.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is related to the number of times a 0 appears in each of the three segments. Let's split each array into three parts based on the 0s in the first array (row0). So the first array has 0s at 4 and 9, splitting it into three segments: positions0-3 (4 elements), 5-8 (4 elements), 10-13 (4 elements). Then, for each subsequent array, compare the 0s in these same segments. So, for row1, the segments are:\n\nFirst segment (positions0-3): all 5s. No 0s here. So in this segment, no 0s.\n\nSecond segment (positions5-8): row1 has 5,0,0,5. So two 0s here.\n\nThird segment (positions10-13): row1 has 0,5,5,0. So two 0s here.\n\nWait, but the output for the first comparison in Example0 is [2,2,2]. So maybe the three numbers represent the count of 0s in each of the three segments between the original array's 0s. For example, in row1, comparing to row0's structure, the 0s in row1's second segment (positions5-8) are two, third segment (positions10-13) have two 0s. But the first segment (positions0-3) has none. So how does that give [2,2,2]?\n\nNot matching. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe each output array element is the sum of the 0s in each of the three segments. For row0 to row1, the original segments (from row0) are three parts. For row1, how many 0s are added in each segment? Wait, row0's first segment (0-3) has 0s in row0: none. Row1's first segment (0-3) also has no 0s. The original 0 in row0 is at position4, which is outside the first segment. The 0s in row1's second segment (positions5-8) are 0s at6 and7. So in the second segment, two 0s. In the third segment (positions10-13), the original 0 is at9 (end of second segment), and in row1, third segment (10-13) has 0 at10 and13. So two 0s. But the first segment has no 0s. So why the output [2,2,2]?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the number of 0s in each of the three segments of the current row compared to the previous row. But not sure.\n\nWait, maybe the output is three numbers, each corresponding to a comparison between three specific positions across the consecutive rows. For example, in Example0, the output arrays are [2,2,2], [8,8,8], [3,3,3]. Each of the three elements in the output array could be derived from comparing consecutive rows in three different parts.\n\nAlternatively, let's look at the sum of each row. Row0: sum is (5*4) +0 + (5*4) +0 + (5*4) = 5*12 =60. Row1: 5*4 +0 +5 (from pos5) +0*2 (pos6,7) +5 (pos8) +0 (pos9) +0 (pos10) +5*2 (pos11,12) +0 (pos13). So sum: 20 + 5 +5 +10 +0 = 40. Then row2 is same as row1, sum 40. Row3 is same as row0, sum60.\n\nBut the outputs are [2,2,2], [8,8,8], [3,3,3]. The sums don't align. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the outputs are related to the number of transitions between 5 and 0 in each row. For example, in row0, the transitions are at positions4 (5\u21920), position9 (0\u21925), and position13 (5\u21920 if next element is beyond the array? Not sure. Maybe the number of times the value changes from 5 to 0 or vice versa. In row0: 5,5,5,5,0,5,5,5,5,0,5,5,5,5. So transitions at 4 (5\u21920), at5 (0\u21925), at9 (5\u21920), at10 (0\u21925). So four transitions. But the output is [2,2,2]. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is encoding the positions of the 0s in some way. For example, in row0, 0s are at positions4 and9. If we take their indices (4 and9), perhaps adding them (13) or multiplying (36), but that doesn't match the output.\n\nLooking at the outputs in Example0: [2,2,2], [8,8,8], [3,3,3]. Each element in the array is the same. Maybe it's the count of something that's the same across the three parts.\n\nWait, 2,8,3. These numbers might correspond to letters (B, H, C), but that seems arbitrary. Alternatively, sum of digits: 2+2+2=6, 8+8+8=24, 3+3+3=9. Maybe not.\n\nAnother approach: look for patterns across all examples. For instance, in Example0's output, the three arrays are [2,2,2], [8,8,8], [3,3,3]. Each array has the same number repeated. Similarly, all examples have outputs with repeated numbers. So the output arrays are triplets where each element is the same. So whatever the pattern is, each element in the triplet is derived in the same way for each position.\n\nSo, perhaps each triplet is derived from a comparison between consecutive rows, and each element in the triplet represents a count from a specific part of the comparison.\n\nLooking at the test input:\n\n[5,5,5,5,0,5,5,5,5,0,5,5,5,5]\n\n[5,5,5,5,0,0,5,5,0,0,5,0,0,5]\n\n[5,0,0,5,0,0,5,5,0,0,5,0,0,5]\n\n[5,0,0,5,0,5,5,5,5,0,5,5,5,5]\n\nWe need to generate three output arrays. So between rows 0-1, 1-2, 2-3.\n\nLet me think again about the training examples. Let's take Example0 again.\n\nRow0: [5,5,5,5,0,5,5,5,5,0,5,5,5,5]\n\nRow1: [5,5,5,5,0,5,0,0,5,0,0,5,5,0]\n\nComparing these, maybe the output triplet [2,2,2] is derived from the number of 0s added in each segment. Let's divide the arrays into three segments based on the original 0 positions (positions4 and9 in row0). So segments are:\n\nSegment 1: 0-4 (but including the 0?), no. Wait, maybe segments are between 0s. So:\n\nSegment1: from start to first 0 (positions0-4 in row0: four 5s followed by 0).\n\nSegment2: from after first 0 to next 0 (positions5-9 in row0: 5,5,5,5,0).\n\nSegment3: from after second 0 to end (positions10-13 in row0: 5,5,5,5).\n\nIn row1, the 0s are at positions4,6,7,9,10,13. So in each segment as per row0's structure:\n\nSegment1 (positions0-4 in row0) corresponds to positions0-4 in row1: all 5s except position4 is 0. So in row1's segment1: one 0 (position4).\n\nSegment2 (positions5-9 in row0). In row1, positions5-9:5,0,0,5,0. Here, the original segment in row0 has 5,5,5,5,0 (positions5-9). Row1's segment2 has 5,0,0,5,0. So comparing to row0, which had 5s except position9. In row1, this segment has two 0s (positions6,7) and position9 is 0.\n\nWait, but how to count. Maybe in each segment, count the number of 0s. In row0's segments:\n\nSeg1: 1 zero (position4).\n\nSeg2: one zero (position9).\n\nSeg3: no zeros.\n\nIn row1's segments:\n\nSeg1 (positions0-4): one zero.\n\nSeg2 (positions5-9): zeros at6,7,9. So three zeros.\n\nSeg3 (positions10-13): zeros at10 and13. Two zeros.\n\nBut the output for the first comparison in Example0 is [2,2,2]. How does that relate?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the difference in the number of 0s between consecutive rows in each segment.\n\nRow0's segments have (1,1,0) zeros.\n\nRow1's segments have (1,3,2) zeros.\n\nSo the difference is (0, +2, +2). But the output is [2,2,2]. Hmm, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the output triplet represents the number of 0s in each segment of the current row. For example, row1's segments have 1,3,2 zeros, but the output is [2,2,2]. Doesn't match.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each element in the triplet corresponds to the number of runs of 0s in each segment. For example, in row1's segment2 (positions5-9), there are two runs of 0s: positions6-7 and position9. So two runs. Maybe that's where the 2 comes from. Then in segment3, positions10-13 have zeros at10 and13: two runs (each single 0). So three segments: seg1 has 1 run (position4), seg2 has two runs, seg3 has two runs. Then sum would be 1+2+2=5, but output is [2,2,2]. Not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output triplet elements are the count of 0s in each of the three segments of the current row, divided by something. For example, in row1's segments: 1,3,2. But the output is [2,2,2]. Maybe the sum of these is 6, which divided by 3 gives 2 each. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the output numbers: 2, 8, 3. Maybe they are octal or hexadecimal representations. 2 in hex is 2, 8 is 8, 3 is 3. Doesn't make sense. Or 2+8+3=13, but not sure.\n\nAnother approach: look at the other examples to find a pattern.\n\nExample1:\n\nINPUT:\n\nRow0: [5,5,5,5,0,5,5,5,5,0,5,5,5,5]\n\nRow1: [0,5,5,0,0,5,5,5,5,0,5,5,5,5]\n\nRow2: [0,5,5,0,0,5,0,0,5,0,5,5,5,5]\n\nRow3: [5,5,5,5,0,5,0,0,5,0,5,5,5,5]\n\nOUTPUT: [3,3,3], [4,4,4], [2,2,2]\n\nSo, comparing rows0-1, rows1-2, rows2-3.\n\nLooking at the first comparison (rows0 and1):\n\nRow0 has segments split by 0s at4 and9. So segments:\n\nSeg1: positions0-4 (5,5,5,5,0) \u2192 one 0.\n\nSeg2: positions5-9 (5,5,5,5,0) \u2192 one 0.\n\nSeg3: positions10-13 (5,5,5,5) \u2192 no zeros.\n\nRow1: [0,5,5,0,0,5,5,5,5,0,5,5,5,5]\n\nThe 0s here are at0,3,4,9.\n\nSo segments based on row0's split:\n\nSeg1 (positions0-4): [0,5,5,0,0]. So zeros at0,3,4. Three zeros.\n\nSeg2 (positions5-9): [5,5,5,5,0]. One zero at9.\n\nSeg3 (positions10-13): [5,5,5,5]. No zeros.\n\nSo comparing to row0's segments, row1's seg1 has three zeros (increase by +2), seg2 same as row0's seg2 (one zero), seg3 same. So the output is [3,3,3]. How does this relate?\n\nAlternatively, the output numbers might be the number of 0s in each segment of the current row. So row1's seg1 has 3 zeros \u2192 first element is3, seg2 has1 zero \u21923, seg3 has0 \u21923? That doesn't fit. So the output is [3,3,3], which would require all segments to have 3 zeros. Which isn't the case. So that's not it.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the number of 0s in each row. Row0 has2 zeros, row1 has4 zeros. But the output is [3,3,3]. Doesn't match.\n\nHmm. Maybe the output numbers are related to the positions where the rows differ. For example, between row0 and row1 in Example1:\n\nRow0: [5,5,5,5,0,5,5,5,5,0,5,5,5,5]\n\nRow1: [0,5,5,0,0,5,5,5,5,0,5,5,5,5]\n\nComparing elements, the differing indices are 0,3,4.\n\nSo three differences. The output for the first comparison is [3,3,3]. Maybe each element in the triplet is the count of differences in each segment. Let's split the array into three segments based on row0's 0s (positions4 and9).\n\nSeg1 (0-4): differences at0,3,4. So three differences here.\n\nSeg2 (5-9): no differences (both rows have 5,5,5,5,0).\n\nSeg3 (10-13): no differences.\n\nBut the output is [3,3,3]. So all three elements are 3, but only the first segment has three differences. This doesn't align.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the triplet is the total number of differences in each of the three comparisons. For example, between rows0-1, there are three differences. Between rows1-2, how many?\n\nRow1: [0,5,5,0,0,5,5,5,5,0,5,5,5,5]\n\nRow2: [0,5,5,0,0,5,0,0,5,0,5,5,5,5]\n\nComparing these, differences are at indices6,7,8.\n\nThree differences. So the output [4,4,4] for the second comparison. Hmm, but 3 differences. Not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output numbers are related to the sum of the indices where differences occur. For example, in Example1's first comparison (row0-1), differing indices are0,3,4. Sum is0+3+4=7. But output is3,3,3.\n\nNo, not matching.\n\nAnother idea: the output triplet corresponds to the number of times a 5 turns into a 0 in each of the three segments. For example, comparing row0 to row1 in Example0:\n\nIn seg1 (0-4), row0 has no 0s except at4. Row1 has 0 at4. So no change here. Wait, but in seg1 of row1, there's no new 0s added compared to row0. Wait, row0's seg1 has one 0 (position4). Row1's seg1 also has one 0. So no change. So why the output [2,2,2]?\n\nThis is getting complicated. Let's think of a different approach. Let's look at the test input and see if any patterns from the training examples can be applied.\n\nTest Input:\n\nRow0: [5,5,5,5,0,5,5,5,5,0,5,5,5,5]\n\nRow1: [5,5,5,5,0,0,5,5,0,0,5,0,0,5]\n\nRow2: [5,0,0,5,0,0,5,5,0,0,5,0,0,5]\n\nRow3: [5,0,0,5,0,5,5,5,5,0,5,5,5,5]\n\nNeed to produce three output arrays, each with three same numbers.\n\nLooking at row0 to row1:\n\nRow0's 0s at4 and9. Row1's 0s at4,5,8,9,10,12,13.\n\nComparing row0 and row1, the differences are:\n\nAt positions5 (5\u21920), 8 (5\u21920),9 (0\u21920?), 10 (5\u21920?), 12 (5\u21920),13 (5\u21925? No, row0's13 is5, row1's13 is5? Wait row1's array is [5,5,5,5,0,0,5,5,0,0,5,0,0,5]. So positions5 is0,8 is0,9 is0,10 is5,12 is0,13 is5.\n\nRow0: positions5 is5, 8 is5,9 is0,10 is5,12 is5,13 is5.\n\nSo differences at positions5,8,9,10,12.\n\nWait, row0's position5 is5, row1's is0 \u2192 difference.\n\nPosition8: row0 is5, row1 is0 \u2192 difference.\n\nPosition9: row0 is0, row1 is0 \u2192 same.\n\nPosition10: row0 is5, row1 is5 \u2192 same? Wait row1's array for position10 is5? Let me check:\n\nRow1's array: [5,5,5,5,0,0,5,5,0,0,5,0,0,5]\n\nPositions0-5:5,5,5,5,0,0\n\nPositions6-9:5,5,0,0\n\nPositions10-13:5,0,0,5\n\nSo position10 is5, row0's position10 is5. So no difference there.\n\nPosition12: row0 is5, row1's position12 is0 \u2192 difference.\n\nPosition13: row0 is5, row1 is5 \u2192 same.\n\nSo differences at positions5,8,12. Three differences. But the output triplet would be [something, something, something]. Let's see.\n\nIf the output triplet's elements are the number of differences in each of the three segments (based on row0's 0s at4 and9).\n\nSegments for row0:\n\nSeg1:0-4 (indices0-4): 5,5,5,5,0. In row1, this segment is 5,5,5,5,0 \u2192 same. So no differences here.\n\nSeg2:5-9 (indices5-9): row0 has5,5,5,5,0. Row1 has0,5,5,0,0. Comparing:\n\npositions5:0 vs5 \u2192 diff.\n\npositions6:5 vs5 \u2192 same.\n\npositions7:5 vs5 \u2192 same.\n\npositions8:0 vs5 \u2192 diff.\n\nposition9:0 vs0 \u2192 same.\n\nSo differences at5 and8 \u2192 two differences in seg2.\n\nSeg3:10-13. row0 has5,5,5,5. row1 has5,0,0,5. Differences at11 and12 \u2192 two differences.\n\nSo total differences in each segment: seg1:0, seg2:2, seg3:2. So output triplet would be [0,2,2], but since the output triplets have same numbers, this doesn't fit. But the output examples all have same numbers in each triplet. So maybe the sum is 0+2+2=4, but how to get three same numbers. Alternatively, take the average or something else.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the triplet elements are the count of zeros in each segment of the current row.\n\nRow1's segments based on row0's split:\n\nSeg1 (0-4): 5,5,5,5,0 \u2192 one zero.\n\nSeg2 (5-9):0,5,5,0,0 \u2192 three zeros.\n\nSeg3 (10-13):5,0,0,5 \u2192 two zeros.\n\nSo the triplet would be [1,3,2]. But output requires same numbers. Not matching.\n\nAlternatively, sum the zeros: 1+3+2=6. Then divide by 3 \u2192 2, so triplet [2,2,2]. That could fit. But in Example0's first output, row1 has seg1:1 zero, seg2:3 zeros, seg3:2 zeros. Sum 6 \u2192 average 2 \u2192 triplet [2,2,2]. Which matches Example0's first output.\n\nSimilarly, in Example1's first comparison:\n\nRow1's segments based on row0's split:\n\nSeg1:0-4 in row1:0,5,5,0,0 \u2192 three zeros. Seg2:5-9:5,5,5,5,0 \u2192 one zero. Seg3:10-13:5,5,5,5 \u2192 no zeros. Sum 3+1+0=4. Average 4/3=1.333. But the output is [3,3,3]. So that doesn't fit.\n\nWait, but maybe it's not the average. Maybe it's the total number of zeros in the entire row, then divided into three parts. For example, row1 in Example0 has 6 zeros. 6 divided by 3 parts gives 2 each. Hence triplet [2,2,2]. Similarly, row1 in Example1's first comparison has four zeros (row1's zeros are at0,3,4,9). 4 divided into three parts would give 1.333, but output is3. Doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output triplet is the sum of the 0s in each segment, but multiplied by a certain factor. For example, in Example0, sum of zeros per segment for row1:1+3+2=6. 6/3=2 \u2192 triplet [2,2,2]. That works. For Example1's first comparison, row1's sum of zeros per segment is3+1+0=4. 4/3=1.333, but output is3. Doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's the total number of zeros added compared to the previous row. For Example0's first comparison (row0 to row1), row0 has two zeros. Row1 has six zeros. The difference is four zeros added. 4 divided by 2 (something?) \u2192 not sure. But output is2,2,2. Not matching.\n\nHmm. Let's try this approach for the test input.\n\nTest Input's row0 to row1:\n\nRow0 has two zeros. Row1 has seven zeros (positions4,5,8,9,10,12,13). So difference of 5 zeros added. But output triplet needs to be three same numbers. 5 divided by 3 isn't possible, but maybe the triplet is something else.\n\nAlternatively, if the triplet is the number of zeros in each segment of the current row (row1), but then divided into three parts. For row1:\n\nSeg1 (0-4 based on row0's split): [5,5,5,5,0] \u2192 one zero.\n\nSeg2 (5-9): [0,0,5,5,0] \u2192 three zeros.\n\nSeg3 (10-13): [5,0,0,5] \u2192 two zeros.\n\nSum is1+3+2=6. 6 divided by 3 is 2. So triplet [2,2,2]. But in Example1's first comparison, the sum was4, which divided by3 is 1.333, but output was3. So this approach doesn't fit all examples.\n\nWait, let's check Example3:\n\nExample3's input:\n\nRow0 and row1 are the same as row0 of Example0.\n\nRow2: [5,5,5,5,0,5,0,0,5,0,5,5,5,5]\n\nRow3: same as row2.\n\nSo comparing rows0-1 (same), rows1-2 (different), rows2-3 (same).\n\nOutput is [2,2,2], [4,4,4], [2,2,2].\n\nFirst comparison (row0-1): same rows, so zeros added:0. So triplet [0,0,0], but output is [2,2,2]. So that approach is invalid.\n\nHmm. Maybe the output is based on the number of times a segment changes from all 5s to having 0s. For example, in row1 of Example0, the second and third segments have 0s added. So how many segments have changes? Two. But output is [2,2,2]. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is related to the number of 0s in each row. For Example0:\n\nRow1 has 6 zeros. 6 divided by 3 gives 2 \u2192 [2,2,2].\n\nRow2 same as row1 \u21926 zeros \u2192 triplet [8,8,8]. Wait, how does 6 turn into 8? 6 is not 8. So that can't be.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each 0 in the row represents a binary digit, and the sum is converted to a number. For example, row1 in Example0 has zeros at positions4,6,7,9,10,13. So positions4:4th index (value 0), etc. But converting the presence of zeros into a binary number where each bit represents a position would give a large number. For example, row1's zeros are at positions4,6,7,9,10,13. So binary 14 bits, with 1s at those positions: 0000100110110000 (but 14 bits). Converted to decimal, it's a large number. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the sum of the indices where zeros are added. For Example0's first comparison, added zeros are at6,7,10,13. Sum is6+7+10+13=36. Divided by something. 36/3=12, but output is2.\n\nNot helpful.\n\nAnother idea: the output numbers correspond to the number of islands of 5s separated by 0s. For example, in row1 of Example0, the zeros split the array into multiple segments of 5s. Let's count them:\n\nRow1: [5,5,5,5,0,5,0,0,5,0,0,5,5,0]\n\nThe segments of 5s are:\n\n0-3: four 5s \u21921.\n\n5-5: one 5 \u21922.\n\n8-8: one 5 \u21923.\n\n11-12: two 5s \u21924.\n\nSo four segments. But the output is [2,2,2]. Doesn't match.\n\nAlternatively, the output numbers are the count of 0s in each row divided by 2. For Example0 row1 has6 zeros \u21926/2=3, but output is2.\n\nNot matching.\n\nThis is really challenging. Let me think of another angle. Each output array has three elements. Maybe each element represents a different aspect, like the number of 0s in each third of the array. Split the 14-element array into three parts: first 5 elements, next 5, last 4.\n\nFor row1 in Example0:\n\nFirst 5 elements:5,5,5,5,0 \u21921 zero.\n\nNext 5:5,0,0,5,0 \u21923 zeros.\n\nLast 4:0,5,5,0 \u21922 zeros.\n\nSum 1+3+2=6. Average 2. Output [2,2,2]. So each element is the count of zeros in each third. First third:1, second:3, third:2. But the output is [2,2,2]. Doesn't fit.\n\nBut maybe they are summed and then divided. For example, 6 total zeros. Each element in the triplet is 6/3=2. Hence [2,2,2]. For Example0's first comparison, this works. Let's check other examples.\n\nExample1's first comparison:\n\nRow1 has zeros at0,3,4,9. So 4 zeros. 4/3=1.333, but output is [3,3,3]. Doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. Maybe it's not that. Another idea: the output numbers represent the count of 0s in each row modulo some number. For Example0 row1 has6 zeros. 6 modulo 7 is6, but output is2. Not helpful.\n\nWait, in Example0's outputs:\n\nFirst triplet [2,2,2]: comes from row1 with6 zeros.\n\nSecond triplet [8,8,8]: from row2 with6 zeros.\n\nThird triplet [3,3,3]: from row3 with2 zeros.\n\nSo 6 \u21922 and 2\u21923? Doesn't make sense.\n\nAnother possibility: the numbers correspond to the sum of the positions of the zeros. For row1 in Example0, zeros at4,6,7,9,10,13. Sum is4+6+7+9+10+13=49. 49 divided by something. 49/3 is16.333. Not matching output 2.\n\nAlternatively, sum the positions and take modulo 10. 49 mod10=9. Not 2.\n\nAlternatively, the count of zeros multiplied by a certain factor. 6*0.333=2. But why 0.333?\n\nThis is not leading anywhere. Let's look for another pattern.\n\nIn Example0's output:\n\nFirst triplet: [2,2,2]\n\nSecond: [8,8,8]\n\nThird: [3,3,3]\n\nNotice that 2+8+3=13. Not sure if that's relevant.\n\nAnother observation: in Example0, the input arrays after row0 have certain 0s added. The output numbers may represent the number of 0s added in each of three sections. Let's see:\n\nRow0 has two zeros (positions4 and9). Row1 has six zeros. So four zeros added. How are these distributed? The new zeros are at6,7,10,13.\n\nSo in the segments based on row0's split:\n\nSeg1 (0-4): no new zeros.\n\nSeg2 (5-9): zeros added at6,7.\n\nSeg3 (10-13): zeros added at10,13.\n\nSo four zeros added in total. But how to split into three sections. Seg1:0, seg2:2, seg3:2. Sum 0+2+2=4. Output [2,2,2]. So perhaps each element is the number of zeros added in each segment divided by something. 0/0.5=0? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each output element is the number of zeros added in a certain segment. But the output is three elements. For Example0's first comparison, added zeros are 4. But output is 2,2,2. Sum 6. Doesn't align.\n\nThis is getting frustrating. Let's try to think of a different approach. Maybe the output numbers are based on the number of 5s that are turned into 0s in each of the three segments.\n\nIn Example0's first comparison:\n\nRow0 has segments with 4,4,4 5s (excluding the 0s). Row1's segments have:\n\nSeg1:4 5s (same as row0).\n\nSeg2: 1 5 (positions5, then 0s).\n\nSeg3:2 5s (positions11 and12).\n\nSo the number of 5s turned to 0s in each segment:\n\nSeg1:0.\n\nSeg2:4-1=3.\n\nSeg3:4-2=2.\n\nTotal 5. But output is [2,2,2]. Not matching.\n\nAlternatively, the number of 0s added in each segment. For row1:\n\nSeg1:0 added (row0's seg1 already had a 0).\n\nSeg2: added 0s at6,7 \u2192 two added.\n\nSeg3: added 0s at10,13 \u2192 two added.\n\nSo total added 0s:0+2+2=4. Output [2,2,2]. If each element is the added zeros per segment, but divided by something. But the sum is 4, not 6.\n\nThis isn't working. Maybe I need to think of the output numbers as part of a different transformation. For instance, the output numbers could represent the number of runs of 5s in each segment. For Example0's row1:\n\nSeg1: one run of 4 5s.\n\nSeg2: run of1 5, then two 0s, then one 5.\n\nSeg3: two 0s, then two 5s.\n\nSo the number of runs in each segment:1,2,1. Sum 4. Output [2,2,2]. Doesn't match.\n\nAlternatively, the number of runs of 0s. In row1's segments:\n\nSeg1: one run of 0.\n\nSeg2: two runs of 0s (positions6-7 and9).\n\nSeg3: two runs of 0s (positions10 and13).\n\nTotal runs of 0s:1+2+2=5. Output [2,2,2]. Not matching.\n\nI'm stuck. Let me look at another example to see if I can find a pattern.\n\nExample2:\n\nINPUT:\n\nRow0: [5,5,5,5,0,5,5,5,5,0,5,5,5,5]\n\nRow1: [5,0,0,5,0,5,5,5,5,0,5,5,5,5]\n\nRow2: [5,0,0,5,0,5,5,5,5,0,5,0,0,5]\n\nRow3: [5,5,5,5,0,5,5,5,5,0,5,0,0,5]\n\nOUTPUT: [8,8,8], [2,2,2], [4,4,4]\n\nComparing rows0-1:\n\nRow0 has 0s at4,9.\n\nRow1 has 0s at1,2,4,9.\n\nDifferences are at1,2.\n\nSo in the first comparison, how does this lead to [8,8,8]?\n\nMaybe the number of differences is 2. But output is8.\n\nAlternatively, the sum of the indices where differences occur. 1+2=3. Not8.\n\nHmm. Alternatively, the sum of the elements that changed. In row0, elements at1 and2 are5, in row1 they are0. So sum of differences (5-0)*2=10. Not8.\n\nAnother idea: each 5 is worth 1, and each 0 is worth 0. Then, sum the entire row. For row0: 14 elements, 12 5s and 2 0s. Sum 12*5=60.\n\nRow1: 10 5s and 4 0s. Sum10*5=50.\n\nDifference is10. But output for first comparison is8. Not matching.\n\nAlternatively, the difference in the number of 5s. From12 to10: difference of2. But output is8.\n\nNot matching.\n\nAlternatively, the output numbers could be the sum of the digits in the row. For example, row1 is 5,0,0,5,0,5,5,5,5,0,5,5,5,5. Summing digits: 5+0+0+5+0+5+5+5+5+0+5+5+5+5 = 5*10 +0*4=50. But output is8. Not related.\n\nAnother possibility: the output numbers are the count of 5s in each segment. For row1's segments based on row0's split:\n\nSeg1 (0-4):5,0,0,5,0 \u2192 two 5s.\n\nSeg2 (5-9):5,5,5,5,0 \u2192 four 5s.\n\nSeg3 (10-13):5,5,5,5 \u2192 four 5s.\n\nSum:2+4+4=10. But output is8. No.\n\nAlternatively, the sum of the 5s in each segment modulo something. 2+4+4=10 modulo 10 is0. Not8.\n\nThis is really challenging. Maybe the output numbers are related to the positions of the 0s in some way. For Example0's row1, zeros at4,6,7,9,10,13. Their positions summed:4+6+7+9+10+13=49. 49 modulo 10 is9. Not2.\n\nAlternatively, the number of 0s multiplied by some factor.6*0.333=2. So maybe each zero counts as 0.333 towards the output number. But this seems arbitrary.\n\nWait, looking at Example0's output:\n\nFirst triplet [2,2,2]: row1 has6 zeros. 6 / 3 =2.\n\nSecond triplet [8,8,8]: row2 has6 zeros. 6 / 3=2. But output is8. So this theory is invalid.\n\nExample2's first output is[8,8,8]. Row1 has4 zeros. 4/3=1.333. Doesn't match8.\n\nAnother Idea: perhaps the output numbers are based on the sum of the positions of 0s in each segment, then some transformation.\n\nFor Example0's row1:\n\nSeg1 (0-4):0 at4 \u2192 sum4.\n\nSeg2 (5-9):0s at6,7,9 \u2192 sum6+7+9=22.\n\nSeg3 (10-13):0s at10,13 \u2192 sum10+13=23.\n\nThen each output element is the sum of each segment's zeros' positions divided by something.\n\n4 \u21922, 22 \u21928, 23 \u21923. Not sure.\n\nBut 4/2=2. 22/2=11, not8. 23/7=3.285. Doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, sum of digits in the sum. For seg1:4 \u21924 \u21924. But output is2. No.\n\nAlternatively, take the sum modulo something. 4 mod 3=1, 22 mod 10=2, 23 mod 10=3. Not matching.\n\nThis isn't working. Perhaps the output numbers are a code based on the number of 0s in each segment. For example:\n\nIf a segment has 1 zero \u2192 code1, 2 zeros\u2192 code2, etc. But in Example0's row1, segments have1,3,2 zeros. Output is [2,2,2]. Doesn't match.\n\nAlternatively, the code is the number of zeros multiplied by a factor. 1*2=2,3*2=6,2*2=4. But output is [2,2,2]. No.\n\nI'm stuck. Let's try to make a guess based on the Test Input.\n\nTest Input has four rows. We need to generate three output triplets.\n\nFirst, comparing row0 to row1.\n\nRow0: [5,5,5,5,0,5,5,5,5,0,5,5,5,5]\n\nRow1: [5,5,5,5,0,0,5,5,0,0,5,0,0,5]\n\nRow1's zeros: at4,5,8,9,10,12,13. Total 7 zeros.\n\nIf the output is based on total zeros divided by3:7/3\u22482.333. But triplet requires same numbers. Maybe the output is [7,7,7]. But looking at the training examples, the numbers don't directly match the total zeros. For example, Example0's row1 has6 zeros, output is2. So not directly.\n\nAnother guess: the output numbers are the count of zeros in the current row, divided by3.5 and rounded somehow. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the output numbers are the count of zeros in the current row minus the previous row. For Test Input row0 has2 zeros, row1 has7. Difference is5. 5 divided into three parts? Not sure. The output examples don't support this.\n\nIn Example0's first comparison, row0 has2, row1 has6. Difference4. Output is2. 4/2=2.\n\nExample1's first comparison: row0 has2, row1 has4. Difference2. Output3. Doesn't fit.\n\nAnother approach: the output numbers are the count of 0s in each row divided by 3.5, but that seems arbitrary.\n\nThis is really challenging. Given the time I've spent and no clear pattern, I'll have to make an educated guess based on the examples.\n\nLooking at the Test Input:\n\nRow0 to row1: zeros increase by5 (from2 to7). \n\nRow1 to row2: zeros remain7 (row1 has7, row2 has7).\n\nRow2 to row3: zeros decrease by3 (from7 to4).\n\nBased on Example0's first comparison where adding4 zeros gives output2, maybe adding5 zeros would give output3, but not sure. But the examples show that when zeros increase, the output numbers vary. \n\nAlternatively, let's look for the test input's row1:\n\nSegments based on row0's split (0-4,5-9,10-13):\n\nSeg1 (0-4):5,5,5,5,0 \u21921 zero.\n\nSeg2 (5-9):0,0,5,5,0 \u21923 zeros.\n\nSeg3 (10-13):5,0,0,5 \u21922 zeros.\n\nSum is1+3+2=6. 6/3=2. So triplet [2,2,2].\n\nRow2:\n\nSeg1 (0-4):5,0,0,5,0 \u21923 zeros.\n\nSeg2 (5-9):0,0,5,5,0 \u21923 zeros.\n\nSeg3 (10-13):5,0,0,5 \u21922 zeros.\n\nSum 3+3+2=8. 8/3\u22482.666. Rounded to3? But output examples have exact divisions. So perhaps triplet [8,8,8], as 8 is the sum. But 8/3 is not an integer. Alternatively, the sum is8, but in this case, the sum is8. Not sure.\n\nRow3:\n\nSegments based on row3's own 0s. Wait, row3: [5,0,0,5,0,5,5,5,5,0,5,5,5,5]\n\n0s at positions1,2,4,9.\n\nSo segments:\n\nSeg1:0-4 \u21925,0,0,5,0 \u21923 zeros.\n\nSeg2:5-9 \u21925,5,5,5,0 \u21921 zero.\n\nSeg3:10-13 \u21925,5,5,5 \u21920 zeros.\n\nSum 3+1+0=4. 4/3\u22481.333. Output triplet [4,4,4]?\n\nBut in Example3's output, similar sums give [4,4,4].\n\nAlternatively, for the test input's three comparisons:\n\n0-1: sum6 \u2192 triplet [2,2,2].\n\n1-2: sum8 \u2192 triplet [8,8,8].\n\n2-3: sum4 \u2192 triplet [4,4,4].\n\nBut in the training examples, Example0's first output is6 sum\u2192[2,2,2], second sum6\u2192[8,8,8], third sum2\u2192[3,3,3]. So sum doesn't directly correlate. But perhaps the output numbers are the sum itself. For example, sum6\u21926, but output is2. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output numbers are the sum of the zeros in each segment, but mapped via some code. For example, in Example0's first comparison, segments have1,3,2 \u2192 sum6, which is mapped to2. How?\n\nMaybe the code is sum modulo 7. 6 mod7=6 \u2192 not2. No.\n\nAlternatively, the sum is divided by3 and rounded. 6/3=2 \u2192[2,2,2]. That fits Example0. For Example1's first comparison, sum4 \u21924/3\u22481.333, but output is3. Doesn't fit.\n\nTest Input's row0-1 sum6\u21926/3=2\u2192[2,2,2].\n\nRow1-2 sum8\u21928/3\u22482.666, but output examples have [8,8,8] when sum is6 in Example0. So that theory is invalid.\n\nAnother possibility: the output numbers are derived from the number of zeros in each segment converted to a digit using a phone keypad. For example, 1\u21921, 2\u2192ABC\u21922,3\u2192DEF\u21923, etc. But in Example0's first comparison, segments have1,3,2. That would be 1\u21921,3\u21923,2\u21922. But output is [2,2,2]. Doesn't fit.\n\nThis is really tough. Given the time I've spent and the lack of a clear pattern, I'll have to make a guess based on the sum divided by 3.\n\nFor the test input:\n\nRow0-1: sum6 \u21926/3=2 \u2192[2,2,2].\n\nRow1-2: sum8\u21928/3\u22482.666 \u2192 perhaps rounded to3 \u2192[3,3,3].\n\nRow2-3: sum4\u21924/3\u22481.333 \u2192 rounded to1 \u2192[1,1,1].\n\nBut looking at the training examples, Example0's third output is [3,3,3], which corresponds to row3's sum2 \u21922/3=0.666. But output is3. So this approach doesn't hold.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output numbers are the count of zeros in the entire row. For Test Input's row1 has7 zeros. But how to split into triplet. 7 divided by3 is2.333 \u2192 perhaps rounded to2. But the triplet has three elements. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the output numbers are the sum of the zeros in each row. Test Input's row1 has7 zeros \u21927, but triplet requires three elements. So [7,7,7]. But in Example0's first output, the sum is6, and output is2. Doesn't match.\n\nI'm really stuck here. Given the training examples and the test input, perhaps the output for the test input is:\n\n[2,2,2]\n\n[7,7,7]\n\n[4,4,4]\n\nBut I'm not sure. Looking back at the examples, when there are more zeros added, the output numbers increase. For instance, Example0's first output is2, which is higher than Example3's first output of2.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the test input's row1 has 7 zeros. Maybe the output is [7,7,7], but in the examples, the output numbers are not directly the count. For example, Example0's row1 has6 zeros, output is2.\n\nAnother Idea: Each output number is the count of zeros in the row divided by3.5. For Example0's row1:6/3.5=1.714\u2192rounded to2. For Test Input's row1:7/3.5=2\u2192[2,2,2]. Row2:7/3.5=2\u2192[2,2,2]. Row3:4/3.5\u22481.142\u21921. But output examples don't show fractions.\n\nAlternatively, the output numbers are the count of zeros in the row divided by3 and rounded up. For Example0's row1:6/3=2\u21922. For Test Input row1:7/3=2.333\u21923. So triplet [3,3,3]. But Example1's first output is3 when row1 has4 zeros. 4/3=1.333\u21922 rounded up. But output is3. Doesn't fit.\n\nThis is taking too long. Based on the examples, I notice that when zeros are added in certain positions, the output numbers are derived based on segments. Since I can't find a clear pattern, I'll make an educated guess that the output for the test input is:\n\n[2,2,2]\n\n[7,7,7]\n\n[4,4,4]\n\nBut I'm not confident. Alternatively, considering the test input's row1 has seven zeros, row2 has seven, row3 has four, maybe the outputs are:\n\n[7,7,7]\n\n[7,7,7]\n\n[4,4,4]\n\nBut looking back at the training examples, the outputs don't directly reflect the total zeros. Example0's row1 has six zeros, output is2. So this theory is invalid.\n\nAnother desperate guess: the output numbers are the number of zeros in each row minus 4. For Example0's row1:6-4=2 \u2192[2,2,2]. Example1's row1:4-4=0, but output is3. Doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, the output numbers are the number of zeros in each row divided by 3. Example0's row1:6/3=2 \u2192 [2,2,2]. Example1's row1:4/3=1.333 \u2192 output3. No.\n\nAnother possible pattern: the output numbers are the number of pairs of zeros in each row. For Example0's row1: there are three pairs (6-7,9-10, and 13 is single). But output is2. Doesn't fit.\n\nAfter hours of trying to find a pattern without success, I'll have to make a guess based on the structure of the test input and the examples. The most plausible guess is that each output triplet is derived by dividing the number of zeros in the row into three equal parts, but since the Test Input's row1 has7 zeros, which isn't divisible by3, I'm not sure. However, in Example0, the sum was6 which is divisible by3. So for Test Input's row1, 7/3\u22482.333, which might round to2, but the output triplet would then be[2,2,2] for row1. For row2, also7 zeros \u2192[2,2,2]. For row3,4 zeros \u2192[1,1,1]. But this doesn't align with the training examples.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and no clear pattern, I'll go with the following output based on the sum divided by3 and rounded down:\n\nTest Input's outputs would be:\n\n[2,2,2] (6 zeros between rows0-1)\n\n[2,2,2] (row1-row2 same zeros)\n\n[1,1,1] (row2-row3 has4 zeros)\n\nBut looking at the training examples, Example0's third output is3, which is row3's 2 zeros divided by3\u21920.666 rounded up to1. But output is3. So this approach is invalid.\n\nFinal guess: The output numbers are the count of zeros added in each segment between consecutive rows. For Test Input:\n\nRow0 to row1:\n\nSeg1: no new zeros (same as row0).\n\nSeg2: added zeros at5,8 \u2192 two.\n\nSeg3: added zeros at10,12 \u2192 two.\n\nTotal added:4. So output [4,4,4]. But in Example0, added 4 zeros and output was [2,2,2]. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAt this point, I'm forced to admit I can't figure out the pattern, but based on the examples, the outputs are triplets with the same number, and the Test Input's first comparison has row1 with more zeros than row0. The output is likely [2,2,2], [7,7,7], [4,4,4]. But this is a complete guess.",

        "cot_2": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. So, the problem is that we have these input lists of numbers and corresponding output lists. The task is to find out how the inputs are transformed into the outputs and then apply that to the test input.\n\nFirst, let me look at the training examples. Each example has four input arrays and three output arrays. So maybe each output array is derived from some relationship between the input arrays? Let's take the first example, Example 0.\n\nIn Example 0, the input arrays are:\n\n[5,5,5,5,0,5,5,5,5,0,5,5,5,5]\n[5,5,5,5,0,5,0,0,5,0,0,5,5,0]\n[5,5,5,5,0,5,0,0,5,0,0,5,5,0]\n[5,5,5,5,0,5,5,5,5,0,5,5,5,5]\n\nAnd the outputs are [2,2,2], [8,8,8], [3,3,3]. Hmm. All the output numbers are the same in each array. So maybe each output array is determined by some count or calculation based on the differences between the input arrays.\n\nLooking at the input arrays, maybe they're grouped into pairs or compared in some way. Let's see. There are four input arrays per example. The outputs are three arrays. So perhaps each output is generated by comparing consecutive input arrays. Like, the first and second input arrays generate the first output, the second and third generate the second output, and the third and fourth generate the third output. That would explain three outputs for four inputs.\n\nSo, for Example 0:\n\nInput 0 vs Input 1 \u2192 Output 0 [2,2,2]\nInput 1 vs Input 2 \u2192 Output 1 [8,8,8]\nInput 2 vs Input 3 \u2192 Output 2 [3,3,3]\n\nNow, let's look at how Input 0 and Input 1 differ. Let's compare them element by element. The first array is [5,5,5,5,0,5,5,5,5,0,5,5,5,5], and the second array is [5,5,5,5,0,5,0,0,5,0,0,5,5,0]. So, positions where they differ are at indices 6,7,9,10,13. Original value was 5 in Input0, changed to 0 in Input1. So the number of differences here is 5. But the output is [2,2,2]. Hmm. Not sure yet.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's counting the number of 0s added or something. Let's see. The first array has some 0s. Let's count the 0s in each input array. For Input0 in Example0: 0s are at positions 4 and 9. So two 0s. Input1 has 0s at positions 4,6,7,9,10,13. That's six 0s. So the difference between Input0 and Input1 is adding four 0s. But the output is [2,2,2]. Not sure.\n\nWait, maybe the output numbers are related to the positions of the differences. For example, when comparing two arrays, maybe each element in the output corresponds to a group of three elements in the input arrays. But how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the arrays are being split into groups. Let's see. Each input array has 14 elements. If we split into three groups, maybe 4, 4, 6? But 14 isn't divisible by 3. Alternatively, maybe the outputs are three digits, each digit determined by some part of the input arrays.\n\nWait, looking at Example0's first output [2,2,2], maybe each 2 corresponds to the number of 0s in a section of the input. Let's see. If Input0 and Input1 are compared, maybe the first output is counting the number of 0s added in certain sections. Alternatively, maybe the outputs are the sum of certain segments.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the numbers in the output represent the lengths of runs of 5s or 0s. For example, in Input0 of Example0, the first array has 4 5s, then a 0, then 4 5s, 0, then 4 5s. But the output is [2,2,2]. Not sure.\n\nWait, another angle: since the outputs are triplets of the same number, perhaps each number represents a count or a code based on the changes between the consecutive input arrays.\n\nIn Example0, the outputs are 2,8,3. Let's see:\n\nLooking at Input0 vs Input1: the differences are positions 6,7,9,10,13. Each of these positions in Input1 are 0 where Input0 was 5. So five changes. But the output is 2. How?\n\nWait, maybe the positions where the changes occur are grouped into three parts. Let's split the 14 elements into three parts. For example, positions 0-3, 4-9, 10-13. Then count the number of changes in each part.\n\nFor Input0 vs Input1:\n\n- Positions 0-3: all 5s, no changes.\n- Positions 4-9: Input0's elements are [0,5,5,5,5,0]. Input1's elements here are [0,5,0,0,5,0]. So changes at positions 6 and 7 (original 5s to 0s) in this segment. That's two changes.\n- Positions 10-13: Input0 has [5,5,5,5], Input1 has [0,5,5,0]. Changes at position 10 (5\u21920) and 13 (5\u21920). Two changes.\n\nBut the output is [2,2,2]. Hmm, but adding up the changes in each segment: first segment 0, second 2, third 2. But the output is three 2s. Not matching. Maybe each segment's count is divided by something. Alternatively, maybe it's the number of 0s in certain regions after the change.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output numbers are related to the number of 0s introduced in each of three sections when comparing consecutive arrays. Let's check Example0:\n\nInput0 vs Input1:\n\nOriginal 0s in Input0: positions 4 and 9.\n\nIn Input1, new 0s are added at positions 6,7,10,13. So four new 0s. But the output is [2,2,2]. Not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the count of something in each row when looking at the four input arrays. But each output has three elements. For example, each output element corresponds to a row in the four input arrays. Wait, there are four input arrays per example. But the outputs have three elements. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is derived from the count of 0s in each column across the input arrays. Wait, each input example has four rows (arrays) of 14 elements. So if we arrange them as a 4x14 matrix, then each column is four elements. The output has three elements. So perhaps the 14 columns are grouped into three parts, and the count of 0s in each group across the rows is calculated. But how?\n\nFor example, in Example0, the four input arrays are:\n\nRow0: [5,5,5,5,0,5,5,5,5,0,5,5,5,5]\nRow1: [5,5,5,5,0,5,0,0,5,0,0,5,5,0]\nRow2: [5,5,5,5,0,5,0,0,5,0,0,5,5,0]\nRow3: [5,5,5,5,0,5,5,5,5,0,5,5,5,5]\n\nThe output is three arrays: [2,2,2], [8,8,8], [3,3,3]. Wait, but how are these three outputs derived from the four rows?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each output array corresponds to a pair of rows. For example, the first output array comes from comparing Row0 and Row1, the second from Row1 and Row2, and the third from Row2 and Row3. Then, each output array's elements are determined by some calculation based on those two rows.\n\nLooking at Example0's first output [2,2,2], which would correspond to Row0 vs Row1. Let's compare these two rows:\n\nRow0: 5,5,5,5,0,5,5,5,5,0,5,5,5,5\nRow1:5,5,5,5,0,5,0,0,5,0,0,5,5,0\n\nDifferences occur at positions 6,7,9,10,13. Each of these positions in Row1 is 0 where Row0 was 5.\n\nSo five differences. But the output is [2,2,2]. So how does five differences translate to 2s?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each element in the output array represents the number of transitions (from 5 to 0) in a group of elements when comparing the two rows.\n\nFor example, split the 14 elements into three groups. Let's see: 14 divided by 3 is roughly 4, 5, 5. So first group 0-4 (5 elements), second 5-9 (5 elements), third 10-13 (4 elements). Then, count the number of transitions in each group.\n\nIn Row0 vs Row1:\n\nGroup 1 (0-4): no changes (all 5s and the 0 is same). So 0 transitions.\nGroup 2 (5-9): positions 5 (5\u21925), 6 (5\u21920),7 (5\u21920),8 (5\u21925),9 (0\u21920). So two transitions (positions 6 and7).\nGroup3 (10-13): positions 10 (5\u21920),11 (5\u21925),12 (5\u21925),13 (5\u21920). Two transitions here (10 and13).\nBut the output is [2,2,2]. So maybe summing the transitions in each group. But group1 has 0, group2 has 2, group3 has 2. But the output is all 2s. Wait, perhaps the groups are different.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the elements are divided into three parts of 4, 4, 6 elements. Let's see:\n\nGroup1: 0-3 (4 elements)\nGroup2:4-7 (4 elements)\nGroup3:8-13 (6 elements)\n\nThen, for Row0 vs Row1 transitions:\n\nGroup1 (0-3): all 5s, no transitions. 0.\nGroup2 (4-7): elements 4 (0\u21920), 5 (5\u21925), 6 (5\u21920),7 (5\u21920). Two transitions here (6 and7).\nGroup3 (8-13): 8 (5\u21925),9 (0\u21920),10 (5\u21920),11 (5\u21925),12 (5\u21925),13 (5\u21920). Two transitions here (10 and13).\nSo total transitions per group: 0,2,2. But the output is [2,2,2]. Not matching. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe the groups are different. What if they are split into three groups of 5,5,4? Let's try.\n\nGroup1: 0-4 (5 elements)\nGroup2:5-9 (5 elements)\nGroup3:10-13 (4 elements)\n\nIn Row0 vs Row1:\n\nGroup1 (0-4): elements 0-4. Only element4 is 0 in both, so no transitions. 0 transitions.\nGroup2 (5-9): elements5 is 5\u21925, 6\u21920,7\u21920,8\u21925,9\u21920. Transitions at 6,7,9. Three transitions.\nGroup3 (10-13): 10\u21920, others: 5\u21925,5\u21925,5\u21920. Transitions at 10 and13. Two transitions.\nTotal per group: 0,3,2. But output is [2,2,2]. Still not matching.\n\nThis approach doesn't seem to line up. Let's think differently.\n\nLooking at the output numbers: in Example0, the outputs are 2,8,3. All same in each array. So maybe each output array's number is derived from the number of 0s in certain positions across the rows.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output numbers are the sum of certain elements in the input arrays. But for Example0's first output [2,2,2], adding three 2s. How?\n\nWait, maybe each output number is the count of 0s in a particular column across the four input arrays.\n\nBut each output array has three numbers. Let's think about Example0's output arrays:\n\nFirst output array: [2,2,2]\n\nAssuming each element corresponds to a column in the input. But there are 14 columns. So perhaps the 14 columns are grouped into three parts, and the count of 0s in each part across the four rows is summed.\n\nFor example, first group columns 0-4 (5 columns), second 5-9 (5), third 10-13 (4). For the first output array in Example0, which is [2,2,2], maybe this counts the number of 0s in each group across the first two rows (Row0 and Row1).\n\nRow0: 0s in columns 4 and9 \u2192 total 2.\nRow1: 0s in columns4,6,7,9,10,13 \u2192 total 6.\nBut how would combining rows 0 and1 give 2,2,2?\n\nAlternatively, for each group, count the number of 0s in the two rows (Row0 and Row1) and sum.\n\nGroup1 (0-4):\n\nRow0: column4 is 0 \u2192 1 zero.\nRow1: column4 is 0 \u2192 1. Total 2.\nGroup2 (5-9):\n\nRow0: columns5-9: 5 is 5,6-8 are 5s, 9 is 0 \u2192 1 zero.\nRow1: columns5-9: 5 is5,6 and7 are 0,8 is5,9 is0 \u2192 3 zeros. Total 4.\nGroup3 (10-13):\n\nRow0: columns10-13: 10-13 are 5s except 9 (which is column9). So zeros in columns none except 9 (but 9 is in group2). So 0 zeros.\nRow1: columns10-13: 10 is0, 11-12 are5,13 is0 \u2192 2 zeros. Total 2.\nSo group sums: 2,4,2. But the output is [2,2,2]. Not matching.\n\nHmm. Maybe another approach. Let's look at the outputs and see if there's a pattern in the numbers.\n\nIn Example0: outputs are 2,8,3.\n\nIn Example1: 3,4,2.\n\nExample2:8,2,4.\n\nExample3:2,4,2.\n\nLooking at these numbers, they are all single digits, and they seem to be factors of 8 (since 8 is present). Wait, 2,8,3: 2*4=8, 8 is 8, 3. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each output number is the count of 0s in a particular row. For Example0, the output arrays have three numbers each. The first output array is [2,2,2], which would correspond to three rows, each having 2 zeros. Let's check.\n\nWait, the outputs have three arrays. For Example0, the first output array is [2,2,2]. If each element corresponds to a row's count of 0s, but in the input arrays, each row has:\n\nRow0: 2 zeros (positions4 and9)\nRow1: 6 zeros (4,6,7,9,10,13)\nRow2: same as Row1, 6 zeros\nRow3: 2 zeros.\n\nBut the first output array in Example0 is [2,2,2]. That doesn't align. Unless the output is not about the rows but the columns. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each output number is derived from the number of times a 0 appears in a specific position across the four input rows. For example, for each column in the four rows, count the number of 0s, then group those counts into three parts and sum them. Then, the output for each part is the sum modulo 10 or something.\n\nBut let's try for Example0's first output [2,2,2]. Let's take the first four rows (the input arrays). For each column (14 columns), count how many 0s are there. Then group the columns into three parts and sum the counts. Let's see.\n\nColumns 0: all 5s \u2192 0 zeros. (Row0-Row3 all have 5 here)\nColumn1: all 5s \u2192 0\nColumn2: all5s \u21920\nColumn3: all5s \u21920\nColumn4: all 0s across all four rows \u21924 zeros.\nColumn5: all5s except Row1 and Row2? Wait, in Example0, the first row is [5,5,5,5,0,5,5,5,5,0,5,5,5,5]. The second row: [5,5,5,5,0,5,0,0,5,0,0,5,5,0]. Third row same as second. Fourth row same as first. So column5 in all four rows: first row has 5, second has5, third has5, fourth has5. So column5: 0 zeros.\n\nColumn6: Row0 has5, Row1 has0, Row2 has0, Row3 has5. So two zeros here.\n\nColumn7: Row0 has5, Row1 has0, Row2 has0, Row3 has5 \u2192 two zeros.\n\nColumn8: All rows except Row1 and Row2 have5. Wait, Row1 and Row2 have5 in column8? Let me check.\n\nRow1 (Example0's second input array): [5,5,5,5,0,5,0,0,5,0,0,5,5,0]. So column8 is 5. Row2 same as Row1. So column8 has 5 in all four rows. So zeros count here is 0.\n\nColumn9: All four rows have 0. So count is4.\n\nColumn10: Row0 has5, Row1 has0, Row2 has0, Row3 has5 \u2192 two zeros.\n\nColumn11: All rows have5 here except maybe not. Let's check.\n\nRow0: column11 is5, Row1:11 is5, Row2:11 is5, Row3:11 is5 \u2192 zero zeros.\n\nColumn12: Row0:5, Row1:5, Row2:5, Row3:5 \u2192 0.\n\nColumn13: Row0:5, Row1:0, Row2:0, Row3:5 \u2192 two zeros.\n\nSo summing zeros per column:\n\nColumns 0-3: 0 each \u2192 total 0.\n\nColumn4:4 zeros.\n\nColumns5:0.\n\nColumn6:2.\n\nColumn7:2.\n\nColumn8:0.\n\nColumn9:4.\n\nColumn10:2.\n\nColumns11-12:0.\n\nColumn13:2.\n\nNow, grouping into three parts. Let's say group1: columns0-4 (5 columns). Sum of zeros: 0+0+0+0+4=4.\n\nGroup2: columns5-9 (5 columns:5,6,7,8,9). Sum:0 (col5) +2 (col6) +2 (col7) +0 (col8) +4 (col9) \u2192 total 8.\n\nGroup3: columns10-13 (4 columns). Sum:2 (col10) +0 (col11) +0 (col12) +2 (col13) \u2192 total4.\n\nSo group sums are 4,8,4. But the first output array in Example0 is [2,2,2]. Doesn't match. Unless there's a different grouping.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the groups are split into three parts as 5,5,4 columns. Let's sum for each group:\n\nGroup1: columns0-4 (5) \u2192 sum 4 zeros.\n\nGroup2: columns5-9 (5) \u2192 sum 0+2+2+0+4=8.\n\nGroup3: columns10-13 (4) \u2192 2+0+0+2=4.\n\nSo 4,8,4. But Example0's first output is [2,2,2]. Not matching.\n\nBut wait, in Example0's first output array, the elements are [2,8,3], but how does that connect to the group sums? The output array for Example0's first output is [2,8,8], but according to the group sums, it's 4,8,4. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each output array's numbers are derived from the transitions between consecutive input arrays. Let's look at Example0's first output [2,2,2], which would be between Row0 and Row1.\n\nIn Row0 and Row1, how many transitions (from 5 to 0 or 0 to 5) occur in each of three groups?\n\nLet's split into three groups again. Say groups of 5,5,4.\n\nGroup1 (0-4):\n\nRow0: [5,5,5,5,0]\n\nRow1: [5,5,5,5,0]\n\nNo transitions here. So 0.\n\nGroup2 (5-9):\n\nRow0: [5,5,5,5,0]\n\nRow1: [5,0,0,5,0]\n\nTransitions at positions6 (5\u21920),7 (5\u21920). Two transitions.\n\nGroup3 (10-13):\n\nRow0: [5,5,5,5]\n\nRow1: [0,5,5,0]\n\nTransitions at 10 (5\u21920),13 (5\u21920). Two transitions.\n\nSo each group has 0, 2, 2 transitions. But the output is [2,2,2]. Hmm. So maybe each group's count is multiplied by something. Or maybe the total transitions across all groups is 0+2+2=4, but output is 2. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the number of transitions in each group is being converted into a digit somehow. For example, 2 transitions in group2 and group3, but group1 has 0. But the output is three 2s. Doesn't add up.\n\nLet me check another example. Take Example1:\n\nINPUT:\n\nRow0: [5,5,5,5,0,5,5,5,5,0,5,5,5,5]\n\nRow1: [0,5,5,0,0,5,5,5,5,0,5,5,5,5]\n\nRow2: [0,5,5,0,0,5,0,0,5,0,5,5,5,5]\n\nRow3: [5,5,5,5,0,5,0,0,5,0,5,5,5,5]\n\nOUTPUT:\n\n[3,3,3], [4,4,4], [2,2,2]\n\nLet's look at the first output array [3,3,3], which would correspond to Row0 vs Row1.\n\nComparing Row0 and Row1:\n\nRow0: [5,5,5,5,0,5,5,5,5,0,5,5,5,5]\n\nRow1: [0,5,5,0,0,5,5,5,5,0,5,5,5,5]\n\nDifferences at positions0 (5\u21920),3 (5\u21920),4 (0\u21920 is same?), wait no, Row0's position4 is 0, Row1's is 0. Wait, Row0's position4 is 0. So the differences are positions0 and3 (5\u21920 and5\u21920). So two transitions. But output is [3,3,3]. Hmm, not matching.\n\nIf we split into groups of 5,5,4:\n\nGroup1 (0-4):\n\nRow0: [5,5,5,5,0]\n\nRow1: [0,5,5,0,0]\n\nTransitions: position0 (5\u21920), position3 (5\u21920), position4 (0\u21920). So two transitions here.\n\nGroup2 (5-9):\n\nRow0: [5,5,5,5,0]\n\nRow1: [5,5,5,5,0]\n\nNo transitions here.\n\nGroup3 (10-13):\n\nRow0: [5,5,5,5]\n\nRow1: [5,5,5,5]\n\nNo transitions.\n\nSo transitions per group: 2,0,0. But the output is [3,3,3]. Doesn't fit.\n\nAlternative approach: Maybe the outputs are the counts of 0s in each of the three subsequent rows. For example, in Example0, the three output arrays correspond to the three middle rows (Row1, Row2, Row3). Let's see:\n\nRow1 has 6 zeros. Output is [8,8,8], which doesn't match. So that's not it.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the outputs are related to the sum of the positions where 0s are introduced. For example, in Row0 vs Row1 of Example0, the new zeros are at positions6,7,9,10,13. The sum of these positions is6+7+9+10+13=45. But output is 2. Not sure.\n\nWait, maybe the output numbers are the count of 0s in certain positions modulo something. For example, the total number of new zeros introduced between two rows modulo 10. In Example0, between Row0 and Row1, there are 5 new zeros. 5 mod 10 is5, but output is2. So that's not it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output numbers are the count of 0s in the entire array after subtracting the previous array. For Example0, Row1 has 6 zeros, Row0 has 2. Difference is4. But output is2. Not matching.\n\nWait, maybe the output is the number of blocks of consecutive 0s introduced. For Example0's Row0 vs Row1, the new zeros are at positions6,7,9,10,13. These form blocks: positions6-7 (two zeros), positions9-10 (two zeros), position13 (one zero). So three blocks. But output is [2,2,2]. Not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the count of 0s in each of three sections when you divide the array into three parts. For Example0's first output, which is between Row0 and Row1, let's divide the array into three sections:\n\nFirst section: elements0-3 (4 elements) \u2192 no 0s.\n\nSecond section: elements4-9 (6 elements). In Row1, there are zeros at4,6,7,9. So four zeros here.\n\nThird section: elements10-13 (4 elements). Zeros at10 and13. Two zeros.\n\nSo counts are 0,4,2. But output is [2,2,2]. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output numbers are the sum of the digits in the counts. For example, 0 \u21920,4\u21924,2\u21922. But the output is [2,2,2]. Not matching.\n\nThis is getting frustrating. Let's try to find another angle.\n\nLooking at the test input:\n\nTest Input:\n\n[5,5,5,5,0,5,5,5,5,0,5,5,5,5] \u2192 Row0\n\n[5,5,5,5,0,0,5,5,0,0,5,0,0,5] \u2192 Row1\n\n[5,0,0,5,0,0,5,5,0,0,5,0,0,5] \u2192 Row2\n\n[5,0,0,5,0,5,5,5,5,0,5,5,5,5] \u2192 Row3\n\nThe output should be three arrays. Following the pattern of the training examples, each output array corresponds to comparing consecutive rows. So first output array is Row0 vs Row1, second Row1 vs Row2, third Row2 vs Row3.\n\nNow, maybe each output array's numbers are derived from the number of transitions (from 5 to 0 or 0 to 5) in each of three segments of the array when comparing the two rows.\n\nLet's try this with the test input.\n\nFirst, compare Row0 and Row1.\n\nRow0: [5,5,5,5,0,5,5,5,5,0,5,5,5,5]\n\nRow1: [5,5,5,5,0,0,5,5,0,0,5,0,0,5]\n\nDifferences where value changed:\n\nPosition5:5\u21920\n\nPosition8:5\u21920\n\nPosition9:0\u21920 (no change)\n\nPosition10:5\u21925 (no change)\n\nPosition11:5\u21920\n\nPosition12:5\u21920\n\nPosition13:5\u21925 (no change)\n\nWait, let me list all positions where Row0 and Row1 differ:\n\nRow0: index5 is5 \u2192 Row1 has0. Change.\n\nIndex5: yes.\n\nIndex6: Row0 has5, Row1 has5 \u2192 same.\n\nIndex7:5 in both.\n\nIndex8: Row0 has5, Row1 has0 \u2192 change.\n\nIndex9:0 in both.\n\nIndex10:5 in both.\n\nIndex11:5\u21920.\n\nIndex12:5\u21920.\n\nSo the differing positions are 5,8,11,12. So four changes.\n\nBut how to split into three groups to get the output elements.\n\nAssume the array is divided into three parts: first 4 elements (0-3), next 5 (4-8), next 5 (9-13). Wait, but that's 4+5+5=14. Let's try:\n\nGroup1: 0-3 (4 elements) \u2192 all 5s in both rows. No changes.\n\nGroup2:4-8 (5 elements):\n\nRow0: [0,5,5,5,5]\n\nRow1: [0,0,5,5,0]\n\nSo comparing these:\n\nPosition4:0\u21920 (no change)\n\nPosition5:5\u21920 (change)\n\nPosition6:5\u21925\n\nPosition7:5\u21925\n\nPosition8:5\u21920 (change)\n\nSo two changes in group2.\n\nGroup3:9-13 (5 elements):\n\nRow0: [0,5,5,5,5]\n\nRow1: [0,5,0,0,5]\n\nCompare:\n\nPosition9:0\u21920.\n\nPosition10:5\u21925.\n\nPosition11:5\u21920.\n\nPosition12:5\u21920.\n\nPosition13:5\u21925.\n\nSo two changes in group3.\n\nSo total changes per group: group1=0, group2=2, group3=2. But output arrays are triplets of same numbers. So maybe each output array's number is the sum of changes across all groups, then divided by something. But 0+2+2=4. But in Example0, the first output was [2,2,2], and the sum was 4. Hmm. Not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each group's change count is converted to a number via some encoding. For example, group1 changes:0 \u21922, group2:2\u21928, group3:2\u21922. But this doesn't make sense.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the changes are represented as binary flags (1 for change, 0 for no change) in each group, and the binary number is converted to decimal. But for group2 with two changes (positions5 and8), if the group has 5 elements, and positions5 and8 are changes, then the binary would be 0 (position4), 1 (position5), 0 (position6), 0 (position7), 1 (position8). Binary 01001 which is 9. Not matching Example0's output of 2.\n\nThis isn't working. Let's try to think of another approach.\n\nLooking back at the training examples, maybe the output numbers are related to the count of 0s in the input arrays. For example, each output array's number is the number of 0s in a specific row.\n\nIn Example0's output:\n\nFirst output array [2,2,2] could correspond to Row1, which has 6 zeros. Doesn't fit. So that's not it.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the number of times a 0 is followed by a 5 in the array. For example, in Row0 of Example0: [5,5,5,5,0,5,5,5,5,0,5,5,5,5]. The transitions from 0 to5 happen at position4\u21925 and position9\u219210. So two transitions. So output could be 2. But the first output array in Example0 is [2,2,2]. Maybe each element in the output array represents the number of such transitions in the corresponding row. But the output arrays have three elements each, and the input has four rows. So this doesn't align.\n\nAnother idea: maybe each output array is derived from the number of islands of 5s. For example, in Row0 of Example0, there are three islands: before the first 0, between the two 0s, and after the second 0. So three islands. But the output is 2. Hmm. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is the count of 0s in the input arrays, but grouped in a certain way. For example, in Example0's first input array, the 0s are at positions4 and9. So two zeros. The first output array is [2,2,2]. Maybe each output array's elements are the count of 0s in each of the three rows, but that doesn't make sense because there are four input rows.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is the sum of the digits in the input arrays. For Example0's first input array, sum is (5*12) + (0*2) =60+0=60. But output is2. Doesn't match.\n\nThis is really challenging. Let me think of another approach: perhaps the output numbers are related to the positions of the 0s in the input arrays. For example, the sum of the indices where 0s occur.\n\nIn Example0's first input array (Row0), zeros are at4 and9. Sum is4+9=13. But output is2. Not matching.\n\nAlternatively, the product of the indices. 4*9=36. 36 mod 10 is6. No.\n\nAlternatively, the count of 0s multiplied by something. Row0 has2 zeros. 2*1=2. Maybe that's why the first output array is [2,2,2]. But in Example1, the first input array has2 zeros. The first output is [3,3,3], which doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. Let's think about the test input and see if we can find a pattern there.\n\nTest Input:\n\nRow0: [5,5,5,5,0,5,5,5,5,0,5,5,5,5]\n\nRow1: [5,5,5,5,0,0,5,5,0,0,5,0,0,5]\n\nRow2: [5,0,0,5,0,0,5,5,0,0,5,0,0,5]\n\nRow3: [5,0,0,5,0,5,5,5,5,0,5,5,5,5]\n\nWe need to generate three output arrays. According to the training examples, each output array corresponds to consecutive row pairs: Row0-1, Row1-2, Row2-3.\n\nLet's compare Row0 and Row1:\n\nDifferences where Row1 has a different value than Row0.\n\nRow0: indices5 (5\u21920), 8 (5\u21920), 11 (5\u21920), 12 (5\u21920).\n\nSo four changes. Now, how to translate this into an output triplet [x,x,x].\n\nIn training examples, when there are four changes, does that correspond to a certain output? Let's look:\n\nIn Example3, the first output is [2,2,2]. Let's check Row0 and Row1 in Example3.\n\nExample3's input:\n\nRow0: [5,5,5,5,0,5,5,5,5,0,5,5,5,5]\n\nRow1: same as Row0. So no changes. Output is [2,2,2]. Hmm, that's confusing. If there are no changes, why output 2?\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's not about the changes but something else.\n\nWait, Example3's output is [2,4,2]. The first output array is [2,2,2], but in their input, Row0 and Row1 are identical. So maybe the pattern isn't based on differences between consecutive rows but something else.\n\nAlternative approach: Maybe each output array is derived from the number of times a certain pattern appears in the input rows. For example, looking for the sequence 5,0,5 or something like that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output numbers are the count of 5s between 0s in the input arrays. For example, in Row0 of Example0: the zeros are at positions4 and9. Between them, there are 5s from position5 to8. So four 5s. But output is2. Not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the number of times a 0 is followed by two 5s. For example, in Row0 of Example0, the 0 at position4 is followed by 5,5,5,5. Not sure.\n\nThis is really tricky. Let's try to look for another pattern.\n\nAnother observation: all output numbers are between 2 and 8. Perhaps they are related to the number of segments in a seven-segment display. For example, the number 2 uses 5 segments, 3 uses 5, 4 uses4, 8 uses7. Wait, but the outputs include 8, which is seven segments. Maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, the numbers could represent the count of closed loops or holes in the digits formed by the array. For example, 8 has two loops, 0 has one, 6 has one, etc. But the outputs include 2,3,4,8.\n\nFor example, if the array is considered as a grid where 5s are lines and 0s are breaks, but this seems too vague.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each array is treated as a binary number where 5 is 0 and 0 is 1, then converted to decimal. But the arrays are 14 digits long, which would be a large number. But for example, in Row0 of Example0, the binary would be 00000100000000 (assuming 5 is 0 and 0 is1). This is 4 in decimal. Not matching the output.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the sum of 0s multiplied by some factor. For example, in Example0's first output array [2,2,2], maybe the first two rows have 2 and 6 zeros, and 2+6=8, but the output is2. Not sure.\n\nThis is really tough. Let's think of another angle: perhaps the output numbers are the number of 0s in each of the three parts of the array after applying some transformation to the input rows.\n\nWait, let's look at the test input and try to deduce the output based on the pattern.\n\nTest input's Row0: [5,5,5,5,0,5,5,5,5,0,5,5,5,5] \u2192 zeros at4,9.\n\nRow1: [5,5,5,5,0,0,5,5,0,0,5,0,0,5] \u2192 zeros at4,5,8,9,11,12.\n\nRow2: [5,0,0,5,0,0,5,5,0,0,5,0,0,5] \u2192 zeros at1,2,4,5,8,9,11,12.\n\nRow3: [5,0,0,5,0,5,5,5,5,0,5,5,5,5] \u2192 zeros at1,2,4,9.\n\nNow, the outputs are three arrays. Let's compare consecutive rows:\n\nFirst output (Row0 vs Row1):\n\nDifferences where Row1 has a 0 and Row0 has 5: positions5,8,11,12.\n\nSo four changes. How to convert this to a triplet of same numbers. Looking back at the training examples, maybe each output number is the number of transitions divided by 2. But four divided by 2 is 2. So maybe [2,2,2]. But wait, in Example0's first output, there were five changes between Row0 and Row1, but the output was [2,2,2]. Not matching.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the number of zeros added between the two rows. Row0 has 2 zeros, Row1 has6. So added 4 zeros. 4 divided by 2 is 2. So output [2,2,2].\n\nSimilarly, for Row1 vs Row2 in test input:\n\nRow1 has6 zeros, Row2 has8. Added 2 zeros. 2 divided by 1 is 2. So output [2,2,2]. But in Example0, Row1 to Row2 had no changes (same array), so zeros added 0. Output was [8,8,8], which doesn't fit this idea.\n\nAnother approach: perhaps the output number is the number of 0s introduced in each third of the array when comparing two rows.\n\nFor test input's Row0 vs Row1, divided into thirds:\n\nFirst third (0-4): no changes.\n\nSecond third (5-9): changes at5,8.\n\nThird third (10-13): changes at11,12.\n\nSo 0 changes in first third, 2 in second, 2 in third. Summing each: 0,2,2. But output is triplet of same number. So maybe sum all and take the total (4), then output [4,4,4]. But in Example0's first output, the total changes were5, but output was [2,2,2]. So this doesn't align.\n\nI'm really stuck. Let me try to look for a pattern in the outputs and inputs across the examples.\n\nExample0:\n\nInput0: 2 zeros.\n\nOutputs: 2,8,3.\n\nExample1:\n\nInput0:2 zeros.\n\nOutputs:3,4,2.\n\nExample2:\n\nInput0:2 zeros.\n\nOutputs:8,2,4.\n\nExample3:\n\nInput0:2 zeros.\n\nOutputs:2,4,2.\n\nNot seeing a direct correlation between input0's zeros and output numbers.\n\nAnother idea: maybe the output numbers are the sum of the digits in the input arrays where 0s are present. For example, in Example0's first output, the sum of the 0 positions in Row1 is positions4,6,7,9,10,13. Their values are0, so sum is0. But output is2. No.\n\nAlternatively, the count of 0s in all rows except the first. For Example0's first output, which is between Row0 and Row1: Row1 has6 zeros. 6 mod 10 is6. Output is2. Doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, think of the output numbers as the result of some bitwise operations. For example, the number of changes is XOR with something. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output numbers are the count of 0s in a specific pattern across the four rows. For example, vertical columns. Let's consider the test input's columns.\n\nTest input columns:\n\nColumn0:5,5,5,5 \u2192 zeros count 0.\n\nColumn1:5,5,0,0 \u2192 zeros count2.\n\nColumn2:5,5,0,0 \u2192 zeros count2.\n\nColumn3:5,5,5,5 \u21920.\n\nColumn4:0,0,0,0 \u21924.\n\nColumn5:5,0,0,5 \u2192 zeros count2.\n\nColumn6:5,5,5,5 \u21920.\n\nColumn7:5,5,5,5 \u21920.\n\nColumn8:5,0,0,5 \u2192 zeros count2.\n\nColumn9:0,0,0,0 \u21924.\n\nColumn10:5,5,5,5 \u21920.\n\nColumn11:5,0,0,5 \u2192 zeros count2.\n\nColumn12:5,0,0,5 \u2192 zeros count2.\n\nColumn13:5,5,5,5 \u21920.\n\nNow, group columns into three parts. Say group1: columns0-4 (5 columns), group2:5-9 (5), group3:10-13 (4).\n\nGroup1 zeros count:0+2+2+0+4=8.\n\nGroup2:5-9:5 (2 zeros),6 (0),7 (0),8 (2),9 (4). Sum 2+0+0+2+4=8.\n\nGroup3:10-13:0+2+2+0=4.\n\nSo totals 8,8,4. But the output for the test input would need to have three arrays. How?\n\nAlternatively, maybe each output array corresponds to the sum of zeros in the columns of the corresponding row pairs. For example, between Row0 and Row1 (test input), the columns where both have 0s. Let's see:\n\nRow0 has zeros at4,9.\n\nRow1 has zeros at4,5,8,9,11,12.\n\nColumns where both have 0s:4 and9. So count 2. So output triplet would be [2,2,2]. For the first output array.\n\nThen, between Row1 and Row2:\n\nRow1 zeros:4,5,8,9,11,12.\n\nRow2 zeros:1,2,4,5,8,9,11,12.\n\nColumns where both have 0s:4,5,8,9,11,12. So count6. 6 divided by 2 is3. But output would need to be [6,6,6], but training examples have numbers like 8,3, etc.\n\nAlternatively, the number of common zeros between consecutive rows. Row0 and Row1 have 2 common zeros (4,9). So output [2,2,2].\n\nRow1 and Row2 have common zeros at4,5,8,9,11,12 \u21926. So output [6,6,6].\n\nRow2 and Row3 have common zeros at1,2,4,9. So4. Output [4,4,4].\n\nBut looking at the training examples, Example0's first output is [2,2,2], which would correspond to common zeros between Row0 and Row1. Row0 has zeros at4,9. Row1 has4,6,7,9,10,13. Common zeros are4 and9. Count2. So output [2,2,2], which matches. Similarly, Example0's second output is between Row1 and Row2. Both have zeros at4,6,7,9,10,13. Common zeros count6. So output would be [6,6,6], but in Example0's second output is [8,8,8]. Doesn't match.\n\nSo this approach doesn't work.\n\nWait, but in Example0's second output is [8,8,8]. Between Row1 and Row2, which are identical. So common zeros would be6 (same as Row1's zeros). But output is8. So this theory is invalid.\n\nAlternative approach: Maybe the output numbers are the sum of the indices where new zeros are added between consecutive rows. For Example0's first output between Row0 and Row1:\n\nNew zeros at6,7,9,10,13. Sum of indices:6+7+9+10+13=45. 45 mod 10 is5, but output is2. Not matching.\n\nAlternatively, count the number of new zeros. In Example0, Row0 to Row1: added four zeros (positions6,7,10,13). So output4, but the output is2. So not matching.\n\nThis is really challenging. Maybe I should look for a pattern in the outputs and inputs that I can apply to the test input.\n\nLooking at the test input's Row0 to Row1 comparison:\n\nDifferences at5,8,11,12. Four changes. Maybe the output is [4,4,4]. But in the training examples, when there were five changes (Example0's first output), the output was [2,2,2]. So maybe it's half the number of changes. 5/2=2.5, rounded to2. Four changes would give2, but that's 4/2=2. So maybe yes. Then for the test input's first output array, [2,2,2]. \n\nFor the second comparison (Row1 vs Row2):\n\nRow1 has zeros at4,5,8,9,11,12.\n\nRow2 has zeros at1,2,4,5,8,9,11,12.\n\nDifferences: new zeros added at1,2. So two changes. Output would be [1,1,1], but training examples don't have such outputs. Or 2/2=1, but Example0's second output was8, which doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, the number of new zeros added. Between Row1 and Row2: added zeros at1,2. So two new zeros. Output [2,2,2].\n\nThen between Row2 and Row3:\n\nRow2 has zeros at1,2,4,5,8,9,11,12.\n\nRow3 has zeros at1,2,4,9.\n\nSo zeros removed at5,8,11,12. Four changes (from 0 to5). So four changes. Output would be [4/2=2], so [2,2,2]. But the outputs in the training examples vary, so this doesn't explain Example0's second output of8.\n\nThis is not leading me anywhere. Given the time I've spent and the competition setting, perhaps I should make an educated guess based on the pattern that each output triplet corresponds to the number of changes between consecutive rows divided by two. For the test input:\n\nRow0 to Row1: four changes \u21924/2=2 \u2192 [2,2,2]\n\nRow1 to Row2: two changes \u21921 \u2192 but training examples have outputs like8, so maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, the number of new zeros added between rows. Row0 to Row1: added 4 zeros (positions5,8,11,12). 4/2=2 \u2192 [2,2,2].\n\nRow1 to Row2: added zeros at1,2. So 2 new zeros \u21922/2=1 \u2192 [1,1,1]. But this doesn't match any training example.\n\nAlternatively, sum of new zeros and removed zeros. Row0 to Row1: added4, removed0 \u21924 \u21924/2=2. Output [2,2,2].\n\nRow1 to Row2: added2 zeros (1,2), removed none. \u21922 \u2192 [2,2,2].\n\nRow2 to Row3: removed4 zeros (5,8,11,12). So changes=4. \u21924/2=2 \u2192 [2,2,2]. But this would mean all three outputs are [2,2,2], but looking at the training examples, when there are no changes (Example3's first output), the output is [2,2,2], which contradicts this.\n\nAlternatively, the output number is the number of added zeros. For Row0 to Row1: added4 \u2192 output4. But training examples don't have this.\n\nAt this point, I'm not confident in any pattern. But given the time constraints, I'll make a guess based on the observation that in Example0's first output, the number of new zeros added is4 (positions6,7,9,10,13? No, 5 changes). Wait, in Example0's Row0 to Row1, added zeros at6,7,9,10,13: five new zeros. But output is2. Five divided by something. Maybe 5-3=2 (but why 3?).\n\nAlternatively, the output number is the number of new zero pairs. For example, in Example0's new zeros at6,7 (adjacent),9,10 (adjacent),13 (single). So two pairs. Hence output2. For the test input's first comparison (Row0 to Row1), new zeros at5 (single),8 (single),11,12 (pair). So one pair. Output would be1. But the output in Example0 was2.\n\nThis is really hard. Given the time, I'll hazard a guess that the output for the test input is:\n\n[4,4,4]\n\n[2,2,2]\n\n[8,8,8]\n\nBut this is a shot in the dark. However, looking at the training examples, outputs often have 2,4,8,3. For the test input's first comparison, four changes (new zeros), so maybe 4/2=2 \u2192 [2,2,2]. Second comparison, two new zeros \u2192 [2,2,2]. Third comparison, four changes (removed zeros) \u2192 [2,2,2]. But this doesn't fit the training examples. Alternatively, the test input's third comparison has zeros removed, which might correspond to output [8,8,8].\n\nAnother approach: looking at the outputs for the training examples, the numbers 2,8,3, etc., might be related to the number of 'islands' of 5s or 0s. For example, in Example0's first output, between Row0 and Row1, how many islands of 5s are there.\n\nRow0 has three islands: before 0, between 0s, after.\n\nRow1 has more zeros, maybe leading to more islands. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the output numbers could be the number of times the pattern 5,0,5 occurs. But in Row0 of Example0, this occurs after the first 0. So once. But output is2.\n\nI think I have to make a guess based on the test input's Row0 to Row1 having four changes, which might be output [4,4,4], but considering the training examples, like Example3's first output where there were no changes but output [2,2,2], this doesn't make sense. Therefore, I'll go with [2,2,2], [8,8,8], [4,4,4] as a possible output, but I'm not certain."
