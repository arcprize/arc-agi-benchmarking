        "cot_1": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. So, there are these input grids and outputs. The inputs are 9x9 grids with 0s, 1s, and 2s. The outputs are lists of five numbers, all 0s and 1s. Let me look at the examples to see what's going on.\n\nStarting with Example 0. The output is [1,1,0,0,0]. Hmm, how does that relate to the input? Let's look at the input rows. Each row is a list of 9 elements. Maybe the output is derived from some feature in each row. But the output has 5 elements, and the input has 9 rows. That doesn't align directly. Wait, maybe it's about columns instead? There are 9 columns in each grid. The output has 5 elements, so perhaps the first five columns are considered.\n\nLooking at Example 0's input, let's check the first five columns of each row. For each column (from 0 to 4), maybe count how many times 1 appears in the first five positions of each row? Let's see:\n\nIn Example 0's input:\n\nRow 0: [0,0,0,0,2,...] \u2192 columns 0-4: 0,0,0,0,2 \u2192 1s count: 0\nRow 1: [0,1,1,0,2,...] \u2192 0,1,1,0,2 \u2192 two 1s\nRow 2: [0,1,1,0,0,...] \u2192 two 1s\nRow 3: [0,0,0,0,0,...] \u2192 0\nRow 4: [1,0,2,2,0,...] \u2192 1\nRow 5: [0,0,2,2,0,...] \u2192 0\nRow 6: [0,0,0,0,0,...] \u21920\nRow7: [0,0,0,0,0...] \u21920\nRow8: [0,1,0,0,0...] \u21921\n\nBut how does this relate to the output [1,1,0,0,0]? Maybe the output is the count of rows where in the first five columns, there's a 1 followed by a 1 (like adjacent 1s) in each of the first five columns? Or maybe for each of the first five columns, check if there's a consecutive 1s pair in that column across any row?\n\nWait, maybe each element in the output corresponds to a column. Let's think: output has five elements. For each column (0 to 4), check if there's a pair of consecutive 1s in that column. If yes, output 1; else 0.\n\nWait, but in Example 0's output, first two elements are 1, then three 0s. Let's check columns 0 and 1 for consecutive 1s.\n\nLooking at column 0 in Example 0's input:\n\nRow0: 0\n\nRow1:0\n\nRow2:0\n\nRow3:0\n\nRow4:1\n\nRow5:0\n\nRow6:0\n\nRow7:0\n\nRow8:0\n\nNo consecutive 1s here. So column 0 has a single 1. So maybe that's not it.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output counts the number of rows where the first five elements contain a pair of consecutive 1s. Then, sum those for each row and then take the first five elements of that? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each position in the output corresponds to the presence of a 2x2 block of 1s in the grid. Let's see. For example, in Example 0's input, looking for 2x2 blocks of 1s. Let's check:\n\nRow1: [0,1,1,0,2,2,0,0,0]\n\nRow2: [0,1,1,0,0,0,0,2,2]\n\nRows 1 and 2 in columns 1-2: 1,1 in row1, 1,1 in row2. So a 2x2 block here. Maybe the output counts how many such blocks there are. But the output is a list of five elements, not a single number.\n\nWait, perhaps the output is a binary representation where each digit represents whether a certain condition is met in each of the first five columns. Let me think again.\n\nLooking at Example 0's output [1,1,0,0,0]. So first two elements are 1, the rest 0. Let's see the columns.\n\nLooking at the first column (column 0) across all rows:\n\nRow0:0\n\nRow1:0\n\nRow2:0\n\nRow3:0\n\nRow4:1\n\nRow5:0\n\nRow6:0\n\nRow7:0\n\nRow8:0\n\nOnly one 1. Column 0 has one 1. So maybe not.\n\nColumn 1 in Example 0:\n\nRow0:0\n\nRow1:1\n\nRow2:1\n\nRow3:0\n\nRow4:0\n\nRow5:0\n\nRow6:0\n\nRow7:0\n\nRow8:1\n\nSo in column1, there are 1s in rows1,2,8. Are there consecutive 1s? Rows1 and 2 have 1s. So consecutive in rows1 and 2. So column1 has consecutive 1s in rows. Maybe for each column (0-4), check if there are consecutive 1s in that column (vertically). For example, column1 in Example0 has 1s in row1 and row2, which are consecutive. So maybe that's why output[1] is 1.\n\nSimilarly, check column0: only a single 1, so no. Column2: Looking at column2 in Example0:\n\nRow0:0\n\nRow1:1\n\nRow2:1\n\nRow3:0\n\nRow4:2\n\nRow5:2\n\nRow6:0\n\nRow7:0\n\nRow8:0\n\nIn column2, rows1 and 2 are 1s (consecutive), so column2 would count as 1. But the output for Example0 is [1,1,0,0,0]. Wait, that would suggest columns0 and 1 have 1s. But column0 in Example0 doesn't have consecutive 1s. So maybe my hypothesis is wrong.\n\nAlternative approach: Maybe the output is the count, for each of the first five rows of the input, of whether that row contains a pair of consecutive 1s. Let's check.\n\nExample0 input:\n\nRow0: [0,0,0,0,2,2,0,0,1] \u2192 no consecutive 1s.\n\nRow1: [0,1,1,0,2,2,0,0,0] \u2192 has 1,1. So count 1.\n\nRow2: [0,1,1,0,0,0,0,2,2] \u2192 has 1,1. Count 2.\n\nRow3: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,2] \u2192 no.\n\nRow4: [1,0,2,2,0,0,0,0,0] \u2192 no.\n\nSo first five rows: rows1 and 2 have consecutive 1s. So maybe output would be [0,1,1,0,0], but Example0's output is [1,1,0,0,0]. Doesn't match.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's about the columns. Let's check the first five columns (0-4) in the entire grid. For each column, check if there are two consecutive 1s in that column (vertically). Then, the output is a 5-element list where each element is 1 if the corresponding column has such consecutive 1s, else 0.\n\nIn Example0:\n\nColumn0:\n\nLooking at the values in column0 across all rows:\n\n0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0 \u2192 1 appears once. No consecutive.\n\nSo output[0] would be 0.\n\nColumn1:\n\n0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1 \u2192 rows1 and 2 have 1s. So consecutive. So output[1] =1.\n\nColumn2:\n\n0,1,1,0,2,2,0,0,0 \u2192 rows1 and 2 have 1s. Consecutive. So output[2] =1.\n\nBut in Example0's output, the third element is 0. Hmm, this doesn't fit. So maybe not.\n\nWait, perhaps the output is determined by checking the presence of horizontal pairs of 1s in each row, but only in the first five columns. For each row, check if there's a pair of consecutive 1s in the first five elements. Then, count how many such rows exist. But the output is 5 elements. Alternatively, maybe for each of the first five columns, check if there's a horizontal pair of 1s in that column's adjacent positions (i.e., in the same row, columns x and x+1 are 1s). So for each column index (0 to 4), check if any row has 1s in column x and x+1. If yes, output 1 for that position, else 0.\n\nLet's test this for Example0.\n\nFor column0 (x=0): check if any row has 1s in column0 and 1. Let's look at the input rows:\n\nRow0: columns0-1: 0,0 \u2192 no.\n\nRow1: 0,1 \u2192 no.\n\nRow2:0,1 \u2192 no.\n\nRow3:0,0 \u2192 no.\n\nRow4:1,0 \u2192 no.\n\nRow5:0,0 \u2192 no.\n\nRow6:0,0 \u2192 no.\n\nRow7:0,0 \u2192 no.\n\nRow8:0,1 \u2192 no.\n\nSo column0 has no such pairs, so output[0] would be 0. But in Example0's output, output[0] is 1. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe for each row, check if in columns 0-4 there is a '1,1' sequence, and then the output counts how many such rows have this in each possible starting position. Wait, but the output is five elements.\n\nAlternatively, the output could be for the first five positions (columns 0-4) in each row. For each row, check the first five elements. If there's a '1,1' in the row, then for each occurrence, note the starting index. Then, aggregate across all rows which positions (0-4) are the start of a '1,1' pair. Then, for each position 0-4, if any row starts a '1,1' at that position, output 1, else 0.\n\nLet's test this for Example0.\n\nLooking for '1,1' in first five elements of any row, and their starting positions.\n\nIn Example0's input:\n\nRow1: [0,1,1,0,2,...] \u2192 '1,1' starts at index1 (columns1 and 2).\n\nRow2: [0,1,1,0,0,...] \u2192 same, starts at index1.\n\nRow8: [0,1,0,0,0...] \u2192 no.\n\nSo the '1,1' pairs start at index1 and index1 again. So for positions 0-4, only index1 has such pairs. So the output would be [0,1,0,0,0]. But Example0's output is [1,1,0,0,0]. Doesn't match. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe the output is counting the number of '1,1' pairs in each of the first five columns across all rows, but in vertical pairs. For example, column0 and column1 in the same row would be a horizontal pair, but maybe vertical pairs. But vertical pairs would be consecutive rows in the same column.\n\nAlternatively, maybe for each column in 0-4, check if there are two consecutive 1s in that column (same column, consecutive rows). For example, column1 in Example0 has 1 in row1, row2, row8. Row1 and row2 are consecutive, so column1 has a vertical pair of 1s. So output[1] =1.\n\nSimilarly, column2 has row1 and row2 as 1s. So vertical pair. So output[2] =1.\n\nBut Example0's output is [1,1,0,0,0]. So maybe columns0 and 1 have vertical consecutive 1s?\n\nWait, column0 in Example0:\n\nRow4 has 1. No other rows. So no vertical consecutive.\n\nColumn1: rows1 and 2 have 1s (consecutive), so yes. So output[1] =1.\n\nColumn2: rows1 and 2 have 1s (consecutive), so output[2] =1.\n\nBut in the output, it's [1,1,0,0,0]. So columns0 and1 are 1. How does column0 get a 1? There's no vertical consecutive 1s in column0. So maybe this approach is wrong.\n\nAlternative idea: Maybe the output is the number of times 1 appears in each of the first five columns. If the count is even, 0; if odd, 1. Let's see.\n\nExample0's columns 0-4:\n\nColumn0: 0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0 \u2192 count=1 (odd) \u2192 1.\n\nColumn1:0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1 \u2192 count=3 \u21921.\n\nColumn2:0,1,1,0,2,2,0,0,0 \u2192 count=2 \u21920.\n\nColumn3:0,0,0,0,2,2,0,0,0 \u2192 count=0 \u21920.\n\nColumn4:2,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0 \u2192 count=0 \u21920.\n\nSo output would be [1,1,0,0,0], which matches Example0's output. Oh! That's a possibility.\n\nLet's check Example1:\n\nOutput is [1,1,1,1,0]. Let's count 1s in first five columns.\n\nLooking at Example1's input.\n\nFirst, for each column 0-4:\n\nColumn0:\n\nRow0:1\n\nRow1:1\n\nRow2:0\n\nRow3:0\n\nRow4:0\n\nRow5:0\n\nRow6:0\n\nRow7:0\n\nRow8:0\n\nTotal 1s: 2 \u2192 even \u2192 0. But output[0] is 1. So this doesn't fit. Hmm.\n\nWait, but maybe it's not the count parity. Maybe it's whether the count is greater than or equal to 2? Let's see.\n\nExample0:\n\nColumn0 count 1 \u2192 <2 \u2192 0? But output is 1. So no.\n\nAlternative approach: Maybe for each of the first five columns, if there's at least one '1' in the column, output 1 else 0.\n\nExample0's column0 has one 1 \u2192 1. column1 has three 1s \u21921. column2 has two \u21921. But output is [1,1,0,0,0]. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's the number of 1s in the first five columns of each row, summed across rows, but converted to binary or something else.\n\nWait, maybe the output is the count of the number of 1s in the first five positions of each row, but summed for each column. For example, for each column 0-4, count how many times a 1 appears in that column across all rows, and then if the count is odd, output 1 else 0.\n\nIn Example0:\n\nColumn0: count 1 (row4) \u2192 odd \u21921.\n\nColumn1: count 3 (rows1,2,8) \u2192 odd \u21921.\n\nColumn2: count 2 \u2192 even \u21920.\n\nColumn3: count 0 \u2192 even \u21920.\n\nColumn4: count 0 \u21920.\n\nSo output [1,1,0,0,0], which matches. Let's check Example1.\n\nExample1's output is [1,1,1,1,0].\n\nSo for each column 0-4:\n\nColumn0: Let's count 1s.\n\nRow0:1\n\nRow1:1\n\nRow2:0\n\nRow3:0\n\nRow4:0\n\nRow5:0\n\nRow6:0\n\nRow7:0\n\nRow8:0\n\nTotal 2 \u2192 even \u21920. But output[0] is 1. So this doesn't fit. So my previous theory is incorrect.\n\nHmm. Let's think of another approach.\n\nLooking at the test input. Maybe the output is related to the presence of 2x2 blocks of 1s in the grid. Let's check Example0. Are there any 2x2 blocks of 1s?\n\nIn Example0's input, rows1 and 2 in columns1 and 2: both have 1s. So that's a 2x2 block. Then, how many such blocks are there? If each block contributes to the output, perhaps the output is the count, but the output is a list. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output corresponds to the first five rows, and each element indicates whether there's a 2x2 block of 1s starting in that row. But again, the output has five elements, not nine.\n\nAlternative idea: Let's think of the output as the number of 1-1 pairs in each diagonal of the grid. But this seems complicated.\n\nWait, looking at Example0's output [1,1,0,0,0], which has five elements. Maybe it's based on the first five rows. For each of the first five rows, check if the row contains a '1,1' sequence. Then the output would be [0,1,1,0,0], but Example0's output is [1,1,0,0,0]. Doesn't match.\n\nAnother approach: Let's look for patterns in the outputs. All three examples have outputs of length 5. Example0 has two 1s, Example1 and 2 have four 1s. What's common in their inputs?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is based on the presence of certain patterns in the first five columns of the grid. For example, checking for each of the first five columns if there's a 1 in the same row as a 2 in another column.\n\nWait, perhaps the output is determined by the number of times a row starts with a 1 followed by a 1 in the first two columns. But then the output would be a count, but the output is a list.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is a binary representation where each position corresponds to a row (first five rows) and indicates if that row has a 1 in any of the first five positions. But Example0's first five rows:\n\nRow0: [0,0,0,0,2...] \u2192 no 1s \u2192 0.\n\nRow1: [0,1,1,0,2...] \u2192 yes \u21921.\n\nRow2: [0,1,1,0,0...] \u2192 yes \u21921.\n\nRow3: [0,0,0,0,0...] \u2192 no \u21920.\n\nRow4: [1,0,2,2,0...] \u2192 yes \u21921.\n\nSo the first five rows would be [0,1,1,0,1], but the output is [1,1,0,0,0]. Doesn't match.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the first five elements of the ninth row. But in Example0, the ninth row is [0,1,0,0,0...], which would give [0,1,0,0,0], but the output is [1,1,0,0,0]. So no.\n\nWait, maybe the output is derived from the count of 1s in the first five columns of each row, but for each row, if the count is even, 0, else 1, and the output is the first five elements of that list. For example:\n\nIn Example0, each row's first five columns count:\n\nRow0: 0 \u2192 even \u21920.\n\nRow1: 2 \u2192 even \u21920.\n\nRow2: 2 \u2192 even \u21920.\n\nRow3:0 \u21920.\n\nRow4:1 \u21921.\n\nRow5:0 \u21920.\n\nRow6:0 \u21920.\n\nRow7:0 \u21920.\n\nRow8:1 \u21921.\n\nSo the list would be [0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1]. Taking the first five elements: [0,0,0,0,1]. But the output is [1,1,0,0,0]. So that's not matching.\n\nHmm. This is tricky. Let's look at another example. Example1's output is [1,1,1,1,0]. Let's see if any pattern there.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the count of 2x2 blocks of 2s in the grid, but that's not relevant to the output length.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is the parity (even or odd) of the number of 1s in each of the first five rows. For each row, if the number of 1s is odd, output 1, else 0, and then take the first five elements.\n\nExample0's first five rows:\n\nRow0: 0 1s \u2192 even \u21920.\n\nRow1: 2 1s \u2192 even \u21920.\n\nRow2:2 \u2192 even \u21920.\n\nRow3:0 \u21920.\n\nRow4:1 \u21921.\n\nSo the first five elements would be [0,0,0,0,1], which doesn't match the output [1,1,0,0,0].\n\nAnother idea: Maybe each output element corresponds to the number of times a certain pattern occurs in the first five columns. For example, each output element could represent a column, and the value is 1 if there's a 1 in that column and the column to the right has a 1 in the same row (i.e., a horizontal pair of 1s in that column and the next). For each column 0-4, check if any row has 1s in that column and the next. Then the output is a list of 1s and 0s for columns 0-4.\n\nLet's test this on Example0:\n\nColumn0: check if any row has 1 in column0 and 1 in column1.\n\nLooking through the rows:\n\nRow1: column0 is 0, column1 is 1 \u2192 no.\n\nRow8: column0 is 0, column1 is1 \u2192 no.\n\nOnly row4 has column0 as1, column1 as0. So no. So column0 would be 0.\n\nBut output[0] is 1. So no.\n\nAnother approach: Maybe the output is the sum of the first five columns for each row, modulo 2. But summing the first five columns per row and taking modulo 2. Then taking the first five rows' results. For Example0:\n\nRow0: 0+0+0+0+2 =2 \u2192 mod2=0.\n\nRow1:0+1+1+0+2=4\u21920.\n\nRow2:0+1+1+0+0=2\u21920.\n\nRow3:0+0+0+0+0=0\u21920.\n\nRow4:1+0+2+2+0=5\u21921.\n\nSo the first five rows would be [0,0,0,0,1]. Output is [1,1,0,0,0]. Doesn't match.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the sum of 1s in each of the first five columns across all rows, modulo 2. Let's see.\n\nExample0:\n\nColumn0 sum:1 \u21921 mod2=1.\n\nColumn1 sum:3 \u21921.\n\nColumn2 sum:2 \u21920.\n\nColumn3 sum:0 \u21920.\n\nColumn4 sum:2 (from row0 and row1) \u21920.\n\nSo output [1,1,0,0,0], which matches Example0's output. Let's check Example1.\n\nExample1's output is [1,1,1,1,0].\n\nCalculating column sums for first five columns:\n\nColumn0:\n\nRow0:1\n\nRow1:1\n\nRow2:0\n\nRow3:0\n\nRow4:0\n\nRow5:0\n\nRow6:0\n\nRow7:0\n\nRow8:0\n\nSum=2 \u2192 mod2=0. But output[0] is 1. So discrepancy here. So this theory doesn't hold.\n\nHmm. Back to square one.\n\nLooking at the examples, each output has five elements. Maybe each element corresponds to a specific row or column after some transformation. Another idea: perhaps each output element represents the presence of a '1,1' pair in the first five elements of each of the first five rows. For example, output[i] is 1 if row i has a '1,1' in its first five elements, else 0. Let's test this.\n\nExample0:\n\nRow0: [0,0,0,0,2...] \u2192 no \u21920.\n\nRow1: [0,1,1,0,2...] \u2192 yes \u21921.\n\nRow2: [0,1,1,0,0...] \u2192 yes \u21921.\n\nRow3: no \u21920.\n\nRow4: no \u21920.\n\nSo output would be [0,1,1,0,0]. But Example0's output is [1,1,0,0,0]. Doesn't fit.\n\nWait, maybe the output is the first five elements of the sum of all rows in the input. Let's see.\n\nExample0's input is nine rows. Summing each column:\n\nFor the first five columns:\n\nColumn0:0+0+0+0+1+0+0+0+0=1.\n\nColumn1:0+1+1+0+0+0+0+0+1=3.\n\nColumn2:0+1+1+0+2+2+0+0+0=6.\n\nColumn3:0+0+0+0+2+0+0+0+0=2.\n\nColumn4:2+2+0+0+0+0+0+0+0=4.\n\nSum for first five columns:1,3,6,2,4. Then, take modulo 2: 1,1,0,0,0. Which matches Example0's output.\n\nYes! That seems to fit.\n\nLet's check Example1:\n\nSumming first five columns across all rows.\n\nExample1's input:\n\nRow0: [1,1,0,2,0,...] \u2192 columns0-4:1,1,0,2,0.\n\nRow1: [1,1,0,0,0...].\n\nRow2: [0,0,0,2,0...].\n\nRow3: [0,0,0,0,0...].\n\nRow4: [0,1,1,0,2...].\n\nRow5: [0,1,1,0,2...].\n\nRow6: [0,0,0,0,0...].\n\nRow7: [0,0,0,2,2...].\n\nRow8: [0,1,0,2,2...].\n\nSumming columns0-4:\n\nColumn0:1+1+0+0+0+0+0+0+0=2 \u2192 mod2=0.\n\nColumn1:1+1+0+0+1+1+0+0+1=5 \u2192 mod2=1.\n\nColumn2:0+0+0+0+1+1+0+0+0=2 \u2192 mod2=0.\n\nColumn3:2+0+2+0+0+0+0+2+2=8 \u2192 mod2=0.\n\nColumn4:0+0+0+0+2+2+0+2+2=8 \u2192 mod2=0.\n\nBut Example1's output is [1,1,1,1,0]. So this doesn't match. So this theory is incorrect.\n\nWait, maybe it's the sum of all the 1s in the first five columns, modulo 2. Let's check for Example0:\n\nColumn0: sum of 1s is 1 \u21921 mod2=1.\n\nColumn1: sum of 1s is 3 \u21921.\n\nColumn2: sum of 1s is 2 \u21920.\n\nColumn3: sum of 1s is 0 \u21920.\n\nColumn4: sum of 1s is 0 \u21920.\n\nWhich matches Example0's output. For Example1:\n\nColumn0: sum of 1s in first five columns of all rows:\n\nLooking at column0:\n\nRow0:1\n\nRow1:1\n\nRow4:0\n\nRow5:0\n\nRow7:0\n\nRow8:0.\n\nOthers are 0.\n\nSum of 1s in column0 is 2 \u2192 mod2=0. But output[0] is 1. So no.\n\nHmm. So this works for Example0 but not Example1. So maybe there's another factor.\n\nWait, maybe it's the sum of all the 1s and 2s in the first five columns, modulo 2. Let's see.\n\nExample0, column0:\n\nSum of 1s and 2s: 1 (only 1, no 2s) \u2192 mod2=1.\n\nColumn1: sum of 1s (3) \u21921.\n\nColumn2: sum of 1s (2) and 2s (2+2=4). Total 6 \u2192 mod2=0.\n\nColumn3: sum of 2s in row0 and row1 (2+0=2) \u2192 mod2=0.\n\nColumn4: sum of 2s in row0 and row1 (2+2=4) \u2192 mod2=0.\n\nSo output [1,1,0,0,0], correct.\n\nExample1:\n\nColumn0 sum of 1s and 2s:\n\nRow0:1.\n\nRow1:1.\n\nOthers:0. So sum=2 \u2192 mod2=0. Output[0] is 1. Doesn't match.\n\nAlternative idea: Maybe it's the count of 1s in each of the first five columns, and if count >=1, output 1 else 0.\n\nExample0:\n\nColumn0 has 1 \u21921.\n\nColumn1 has 3 \u21921.\n\nColumn2 has 2 \u21921.\n\nColumn3:0 \u21920.\n\nColumn4:0 \u21920.\n\nBut output is [1,1,0,0,0]. So column2 would be 1, but output[2] is 0. So no.\n\nAnother approach: Maybe the output is based on the presence of vertical pairs of 1s in the first five columns. For each column, check if there are two consecutive 1s vertically. If yes, output 1 else 0.\n\nExample0's column1 has consecutive 1s in rows1 and2 \u21921.\n\nColumn2 has consecutive 1s in rows1 and2 \u21921.\n\nOther columns no. So output would be [0,1,1,0,0]. But Example0's output is [1,1,0,0,0]. So no.\n\nWait, maybe the output is based on the presence of any 1 in the first five columns of each row. For each of the first five rows, output 1 if there's at least one 1 in the first five columns, else 0. Then take the first five elements. But in Example0:\n\nRow0: no \u21920.\n\nRow1: yes \u21921.\n\nRow2: yes \u21921.\n\nRow3: no \u21920.\n\nRow4: yes \u21921.\n\nSo output [0,1,1,0,1], but Example0's output is [1,1,0,0,0]. Doesn't match.\n\nThis is really challenging. Let me look for another pattern.\n\nLooking at the test input:\n\nTest Input:\n\nRow0: [0,0,0,0,0,2,2,0,1]\n\nRow1: [1,1,0,1,0,2,2,0,0]\n\nRow2: [1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow3: [0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0]\n\nRow4: [0,2,2,0,0,1,1,0,0]\n\nRow5: [0,2,2,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow6: [1,0,0,0,0,0,2,2,0]\n\nRow7: [2,2,0,1,1,0,2,2,0]\n\nRow8: [2,2,0,1,1,0,0,0,0]\n\nIf the pattern is sum of 1s in first five columns mod2, let's compute:\n\nColumn0: sum of 1s:\n\nRow1:1, Row2:1, Row6:1 \u2192 sum=3 \u2192 mod2=1.\n\nColumn1: Row1:1, Row2:1 \u2192 sum=2 \u21920.\n\nColumn2: all zeros except Row0-5 may have, but looking for 1s. No 1s in column2 of first five columns. Sum=0 \u21920.\n\nColumn3: Row1 has 1, Row7 has 1, Row8 has 1 \u2192 sum=3 \u21921.\n\nColumn4: Row7 and 8 have 1s \u2192 sum=2 \u21920.\n\nSo output would be [1,0,0,1,0]. But looking at the training examples, this doesn't match any pattern. However, the correct answer might be different.\n\nWait, perhaps it's the sum of 1s in each of the first five columns, mod 2. For the test input:\n\nColumn0:\n\nRows: 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8.\n\nFirst five columns (columns0-4):\n\nRow0: 0,0,0,0,0 \u2192 column0:0.\n\nRow1:1 \u2192 column0:1.\n\nRow2:1 \u2192 column0:1.\n\nRow3:0 \u2192 column0:0.\n\nRow4:0 \u2192 column0:0.\n\nRow5:0 \u2192 column0:0.\n\nRow6:1 \u2192 column0:1.\n\nRow7:2 \u2192 column0:2 (not counted as 1).\n\nRow8:2 \u2192 column0:2.\n\nSum of 1s in column0: rows1,2,6 \u2192 three 1s \u2192 mod2=1.\n\nColumn1:\n\nRow1:1, row2:1 \u2192 sum 2 \u21920.\n\nColumn2: all 0s \u21920.\n\nColumn3: row1 has 1, row7 has 1, row8 has1 \u2192 sum 3 \u21921.\n\nColumn4: row7 and 8 have 1s \u2192 sum2 \u21920.\n\nSo the output would be [1,0,0,1,0]. But the training examples have outputs like [1,1,0,0,0], [1,1,1,1,0], etc.\n\nThis doesn't seem to match. But I'm stuck. Maybe I should look for another pattern.\n\nAnother idea: Looking at the output lengths, each is five elements. The first five columns in the grid have indices 0-4. Perhaps the output is the count of 1s in each of the first five rows, but only in their corresponding column. For example, output[0] is the count of 1s in column0 of row0, output[1] column1 of row1, etc. But Example0's output is [1,1,0,0,0]. \n\nRow0 column0:0 \u2192 output[0] should be 0. Doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, output[i] is 1 if there's a 1 in row i, column i. For Example0:\n\nRow0, column0:0 \u21920.\n\nRow1, column1:1 \u21921.\n\nRow2, column2:1 \u21921.\n\nRow3, column3:0 \u21920.\n\nRow4, column4:0 \u21920.\n\nSo output [0,1,1,0,0], but Example0's output is [1,1,0,0,0]. Doesn't match.\n\nAlternative approach: Perhaps each output element corresponds to the presence of a 1 in the fifth position of each row. For five elements, maybe first five rows' fifth elements. \n\nExample0's first five rows' fifth elements (index4):\n\nRow0:2 \u2192 no.\n\nRow1:2 \u2192 no.\n\nRow2:0 \u2192 no.\n\nRow3:0 \u2192 no.\n\nRow4:0 \u2192 no.\n\nSo output [0,0,0,0,0], but Example0's output is [1,1,0,0,0]. Not matching.\n\nThis is really tough. Let me think of the examples again.\n\nExample0's output is [1,1,0,0,0]. Example1 and 2 have [1,1,1,1,0]. Looking for a pattern where the first four elements are 1s in examples 1 and 2. \n\nLooking at the test input:\n\nThe output should be determined by some rule that applies to the first five columns. Let's check for '1,1' pairs in the first five columns of any row. For the test input:\n\nRow1: [1,1,0,1,0,...] \u2192 '1,1' in columns0-1.\n\nRow2: [1,1,0,0,0,...] \u2192 '1,1' in columns0-1.\n\nRow7: columns3-4 are 1,1.\n\nRow8: columns3-4 are 1,1.\n\nSo in the test input, the '1,1' pairs appear in columns0-1 and 3-4. But how does this relate to the output? The output has five elements. Maybe each element corresponds to a column, and if that column is part of a '1,1' pair in any row, then it's 1.\n\nFor example, columns0 and1 have pairs in rows1 and 2. So columns0 and1 would be 1. Columns3 and4 have pairs in rows7 and8. So columns3 and4 would be 1. But the output has five elements, so maybe columns0-4. So output would be [1,1,0,1,1]. But the training examples don't fit. For example, in Example0, columns1 and2 have pairs, so output would be [0,1,1,0,0], which matches the output [1,1,0,0,0] only if columns0 also has a pair. Which it doesn't. So this theory is incorrect.\n\nAnother idea: Maybe the output is the count of '1,1' pairs in each of the first five columns. For example, column0 would have a count of pairs that start in column0. So for each column0, check how many times '1,1' starts in column0 in any row. Then, output 1 if count is odd, else 0.\n\nIn Example0:\n\nColumns0-4.\n\nColumn0: no '1,1' pairs starting here.\n\nColumn1: two pairs (rows1 and2).\n\nColumn2: no.\n\nColumns3: no.\n\nColumn4: no.\n\nSo counts: [0,2,0,0,0]. mod2: [0,0,0,0,0]. Doesn't match output [1,1,0,0,0].\n\nHmm. I'm really stuck. Let me try to find a different angle.\n\nLooking at the test input again. Maybe the output is related to the number of 1s in the first five columns of each column, but in a certain way. For example, if a column has an odd number of 1s, output 1; else 0.\n\nTest input:\n\nColumn0: rows1,2,6 have 1s \u2192 three \u21921.\n\nColumn1: rows1,2 \u2192 two \u21920.\n\nColumn2: none \u21920.\n\nColumn3: rows1,7,8 \u2192 three \u21921.\n\nColumn4: rows7,8 \u2192 two \u21920.\n\nSo output [1,0,0,1,0].\n\nBut in Example1's output, [1,1,1,1,0], let's check:\n\nExample1's input:\n\nColumn0 sum of 1s: row0 and row1 \u2192 two \u21920. But output[0] is1. Doesn't fit.\n\nSo this theory is invalid.\n\nAt this point, I'm not sure. Perhaps I should look for a pattern that involves both 1s and 2s. For instance, maybe the output is based on the difference between the count of 1s and 2s in the first five columns. But this is getting too complex.\n\nWait, looking at the training examples again. The output for Example0 is [1,1,0,0,0]. Example1 and 2 have [1,1,1,1,0]. Let's see the input for Example1. \n\nExample1's input has several rows with 1,1 pairs. For example, row0: [1,1,0,2,0...]. Row1: [1,1,0,0,0...]. Row4: [0,1,1,0,2...]. Row5: [0,1,1,0,2...]. Row7: [0,0,0,2,2...]. Row8: [0,1,0,2,2...]. So in Example1, there are '1,1' pairs in columns0-1 (rows0,1), columns1-2 (rows4,5). \n\nSo in columns0 and1, there are multiple '1,1' pairs. Maybe the output is the count of '1,1' pairs in each of the first five columns (as the starting column). For example, column0: how many '1,1' pairs start here. If at least one, output1.\n\nIn Example0: '1,1' starts in column1 in two rows. So output[1] =1. But Example0's output is [1,1,0,0,0], which suggests columns0 and1 have 1s. So maybe the output is 1 if there's at least one '1,1' pair starting in column i, for i in 0-4.\n\nExample0:\n\nColumn0: no pairs \u21920.\n\nColumn1: two pairs \u21921.\n\nColumn2: no pairs \u21920.\n\nColumns3-4: no.\n\nBut output is [1,1,0,0,0]. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternative idea: Maybe the output is the count of '1,1' pairs in each row's first five elements, summed across all rows, and then the first five elements of that sum. But Example0 has three pairs (rows1,2, and maybe others?), leading to a sum that's higher.\n\nBut the output is a list of five elements, not a single number. \n\nI think I'm going in circles here. Given the time I've spent and not found a clear pattern, perhaps the correct answer is [1,1,1,1,0], similar to Examples1 and 2. But the test input has multiple '1,1' pairs in columns0-1 and 3-4. However, looking at the output for Examples1 and 2, which have four 1s, maybe the test input's output is [1,1,1,1,0].\n\nBut I'm not sure. Alternatively, the test input's output could be [1,1,0,0,0], but that's similar to Example0. \n\nAlternatively, based on the previous theory where the sum of 1s in each column mod2:\n\nTest input columns0-4:\n\nColumn0 sum of 1s:3\u21921.\n\nColumn1:2\u21920.\n\nColumn2:0\u21920.\n\nColumn3:3\u21921.\n\nColumn4:2\u21920.\n\nOutput would be [1,0,0,1,0]. But this doesn't match any training examples. So perhaps that's not the right approach.\n\nAnother possible pattern: The output is the first five elements of the sum of all the rows, but only considering the 1s and ignoring 2s. Then, each element is 1 if the sum is odd.\n\nFor the test input:\n\nColumn0: 1,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0 \u2192 sum of 1s:4 \u2192 even \u21920.\n\nWait, row0 has 0, row1 has1, row2 has1, row6 has1 \u2192 sum 3 \u2192 odd \u21921.\n\nColumn1:1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0 \u2192 sum 3 \u21921.\n\nColumn2:0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0 \u21920.\n\nColumn3:0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1 \u2192 sum3 \u21921.\n\nColumn4:0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1 \u2192 sum2 \u21920.\n\nSo output [1,1,0,1,0]. But again, this doesn't match the training examples. \n\nI'm really stuck. Given the time I've spent, I'll make an educated guess based on the sum of 1s in each column mod2. For the test input:\n\nColumn0:3\u21921.\n\nColumn1:2\u21920.\n\nColumn2:0\u21920.\n\nColumn3:3\u21921.\n\nColumn4:2\u21920.\n\nOutput: [1,0,0,1,0]. But none of the training examples have this pattern. Alternatively, maybe it's [1,1,1,1,0], like Examples1 and 2. Perhaps because there are four '1,1' pairs in the first five columns across the test input's rows. So the answer might be [1,1,1,1,0].",

        "cot_2": "Okay, let's tackle this puzzle. So, we have these input grids and corresponding output arrays. The goal is to find the pattern that transforms the input into the output and apply it to the test input.\n\nFirst, let's look at the training examples. Each input is a 9x9 grid of numbers (0s, 1s, and 2s), and the output is a 5-element array of 1s and 0s. The outputs for the examples are [1,1,0,0,0], [1,1,1,1,0], and [1,1,1,1,0]. The test input is another 9x9 grid, and we need to generate the output array based on the discovered pattern.\n\nHmm. Let's start by analyzing the first example. The input is a 9x9 grid. The output is a 5-element array. Since the output length is 5, maybe each element corresponds to a certain row or column in the input. But the input has 9 rows and 9 columns. Alternatively, maybe it's divided into sections. Wait, 9 rows divided into 5 parts... Not sure yet.\n\nLooking at Example 0's input and output. The output has five elements. Let's check the input grid for patterns in rows or columns. Let's see:\n\nIn Example 0's input, each row is a list. Let's check if the output corresponds to the count of certain patterns in each row. For instance, maybe each element in the output represents the presence of a specific sequence in each row. For example, the first element of the output is 1; maybe it's whether the first row has a certain pattern. But the output has five elements, and there are nine rows. Alternatively, maybe grouping rows into pairs or something else.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each position in the output corresponds to a diagonal, or a specific region of the grid. Another approach: check if the output counts the number of times a particular pattern occurs in the grid. For instance, maybe each 1 in the output represents a row that contains a pair of 1s followed by a pair of 2s, or something like that.\n\nWait, let's look at the first example's output [1,1,0,0,0]. Let's check each row in the input. Let's take the first row of Example 0: [0,0,0,0,2,2,0,0,1]. There's a pair of 2s in positions 4-5. Then the second row: [0,1,1,0,2,2,0,0,0] has a pair of 1s in positions 1-2 and a pair of 2s in 4-5. The third row: [0,1,1,0,0,0,0,2,2] has 1s in 1-2 and 2s in 7-8. The fourth row has 2s in 7-8. The fifth row: [1,0,2,2,0,0,0,0,0] has 2s in positions 3-4. The sixth row: 2s in 2-3, 1s in 5-6. Seventh row: 1s in 5-6. Eighth row all zeros. Ninth row: 1s at positions 1 and 8.\n\nThe output is [1,1,0,0,0]. Maybe the output is counting the number of rows where a certain condition is met. But there are 9 rows and output is 5 elements. Alternatively, maybe the output represents the presence of consecutive pairs in specific positions across the rows. For example, check each row for a pair of 1s followed by a pair of 2s. Let's see:\n\nIn Example 0's input rows:\n\nRow 0: 2s at 4-5. No 1s before. So maybe that's a 2 pair but not after 1s. Row 1 has 1s at 1-2 and 2s at 4-5. So 1s followed by 2s. Row 2: 1s at 1-2, then later 2s at 7-8. So maybe separated by zeros. Row 3: only 2s at 7-8. Row 4: 2s at 3-4. Row 5: 2s at 2-3, 1s at 5-6. So 2s followed by 1s. Row 6: 1s at 5-6. Row 8: single 1s.\n\nSo rows 1,2 might have 1 pairs followed by 2 pairs. Let's count how many times this occurs. If output is [1,1,0,0,0], perhaps the first two positions are 1s (meaning two rows meet the condition), and the rest 0. But in Example 0's output, first two are 1s. Let's see the count. If the output elements are cumulative counts (like first element is 1 if at least one row meets condition, second if two rows, etc.), but the output has 5 elements. Hmm, not sure.\n\nAnother approach: Maybe the output array corresponds to the first five rows of the input grid. Let's check Example 0's first five rows. For each of these rows, determine if a certain condition is met. The output is [1,1,0,0,0], which would mean that the first two rows meet the condition, and the next three do not. Let's check:\n\nRow 0: 0s, then 2,2, then 0s and a 1. Maybe the condition is the presence of both a 1-pair and a 2-pair in the same row. Row 0 has a 2-pair but no 1-pair. So condition not met. Row 1: has 1-pair and 2-pair. So condition met. Row 2: has 1-pair and 2-pair. So condition met. Row 3: only 2-pair. Row 4: 2-pair but no 1-pair. So in the first five rows, rows 1 and 2 meet the condition (1-pair and 2-pair), so the output would be [1,1,0,0,0]. But the output is [1,1,0,0,0]. So maybe each element of the output represents whether the corresponding row (rows 0-4) in the input meets the condition. But in Example 0's first five rows, rows 1 and 2 (indices 1 and 2) meet the condition. But the output has 1s in positions 0 and 1. That doesn't align. So perhaps the rows are ordered differently.\n\nWait, maybe the output counts the occurrence of 1-pairs followed by 2-pairs in each of the first five columns. Or maybe the output is based on columns instead of rows.\n\nLooking at Example 0's output [1,1,0,0,0], maybe each element corresponds to a column in the input. Let's check columns 0-4. For each column, check if there's a 1 followed by a 2 in some way.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each output element represents the presence of a 1-1-2-2 sequence in the rows. But the output is length 5, and the examples have varying numbers.\n\nAlternatively, consider that the output is the count of certain patterns in the grid. For example, the first element could be the number of 1-pairs in the grid, the second the number of 2-pairs, but the numbers don't match. In Example 0's output, the first two are 1s. Let's count 1-pairs: rows 1, 2, 5, 6, 8 (but row 8 has 1s at 1 and 8, not consecutive). So rows 1, 2, 5, 6 have consecutive 1s. So 4 pairs. Output first element is 1. Doesn't align.\n\nAnother angle: perhaps the output is derived from the positions of 1s and 2s in the grid. For instance, each element in the output could represent a diagonal or a quadrant. Alternatively, maybe the grid is divided into 5 regions, and the output indicates whether each region has a certain property.\n\nWait, the grid is 9x9. If divided into 5 regions, perhaps like the center and four corners. But that's unclear. Alternatively, considering the output length is 5, maybe each element corresponds to a row in the middle or something else.\n\nLooking at Example 1's output [1,1,1,1,0]. Let's see if there's a pattern here. Maybe each element represents a consecutive pair of 1s followed by a pair of 2s in the same row. Let's check the first five rows of Example 1's input:\n\nRow 0: [1,1,0,2,0,0,0,0,2]. Has 1-pair at start, then a 2 at index 3. Not followed by a 2-pair. So maybe no.\n\nRow 1: [1,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0]. Two 1-pairs (indices 0-1 and 5-6). No 2-pairs. So no.\n\nRow 2: [0,0,0,2,0,1,1,0,0]. 1-pair at 5-6. 2 at index 3. Not a pair.\n\nRow 3: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1]. Only a single 1. No pairs.\n\nRow 4: [0,1,1,0,2,2,0,0,0]. 1-pair at 1-2, followed by 2-pair at 4-5. So this row meets the condition.\n\nSo in the first five rows of Example 1, only row 4 meets the condition. But the output is [1,1,1,1,0], which has four 1s. That doesn't match. So maybe the output isn't based on rows.\n\nAlternative approach: look for the number of times a 1-pair and a 2-pair appear in the same row, but not necessarily adjacent. The output could be the count of such rows, but in Example 0, there are three rows (1,2,5) with both 1-pairs and 2-pairs. But the output has two 1s. Hmm, not directly.\n\nWait, maybe the output is a binary representation where each bit indicates whether a certain row has both a 1-pair and a 2-pair. Let's list for each example:\n\nExample 0:\nRow 0: 2-pair, no 1-pair \u2192 0\nRow 1: 1-pair and 2-pair \u2192 1\nRow 2: 1-pair and 2-pair \u2192 1\nRow 3: 2-pair only \u21920\nRow 4: 2-pair only \u21920\nRow 5: 2-pair and 1-pair \u21921\nRow 6: 1-pair only \u21920\nRow 7: 0s \u21920\nRow 8: single 1s \u21920\n\nSo rows 1,2,5 meet the condition. But the output is [1,1,0,0,0]. If the output is taking the first five rows, then rows 1 and 2 (indices 1 and 2) would correspond to positions 1 and 2 in the output. But Example 0's output has 1s in positions 0 and 1, which might not align. Alternatively, perhaps the output counts how many such rows are present in the first five rows. In Example 0, first five rows have rows 1 and 2 (two instances). But the output starts with 1,1. Maybe each position in the output increments when a row meets the condition. Like, first position is 1 if there's at least one such row in the first five, second if two, etc. So for Example 0, two instances \u2192 [1,1,0,0,0]. For Example 1, maybe four such rows, leading to [1,1,1,1,0]. Let's check Example 1's rows:\n\nExample 1's input rows:\n\nRow 0: [1,1,0,2,0,0,0,0,2] \u2192 1-pair at 0-1, 2 at 3 and 8 (not a pair). So no 2-pair. \u2192 0\n\nRow 1: [1,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0] \u2192 two 1-pairs. No 2-pairs. \u21920\n\nRow 2: [0,0,0,2,0,1,1,0,0] \u2192 1-pair at 5-6. Single 2. \u21920\n\nRow 3: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1] \u2192 no pairs. \u21920\n\nRow 4: [0,1,1,0,2,2,0,0,0] \u2192 1-pair and 2-pair \u21921\n\nRow 5: [0,1,1,0,2,2,0,0,2] \u2192 1-pair and 2-pair (4-5) \u21921\n\nRow 6: all zeros \u21920\n\nRow 7: [0,0,0,2,2,0,1,1,0] \u21922-pair at 3-4 and 1-pair at 6-7 \u21921\n\nRow 8: [0,1,0,2,2,0,1,1,0] \u2192 2-pair at 3-4, 1-pair at 6-7 and 0 has a single 1. So 2-pair and 1-pair \u21921\n\nSo total in Example 1's rows: rows 4,5,7,8 meet the condition. So four instances. The output is [1,1,1,1,0], which has four 1s. That fits. So the output might be the count of rows (up to five) that have both a 1-pair and a 2-pair. Each position in the output represents whether there are at least 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 such rows. For example, if there are three such rows, the output would be [1,1,1,0,0]. So for Example 0, there are three such rows (rows 1,2,5), but the output is [1,1,0,0,0]. Wait, this doesn't align. Because three rows would require the first three elements to be 1. But in Example 0's output, only two 1s. So perhaps the count is limited to the first five rows of the input. Let's check:\n\nIn Example 0:\n\nRows 0-4: rows 1,2 meet the condition (two instances). So output would be [1,1,0,0,0], which matches the given output. \n\nIn Example 1:\n\nRows 0-4: only row 4 meets the condition (one instance). But the output is [1,1,1,1,0], which suggests four instances. So this theory is invalid.\n\nWait, maybe the output is not based on the first five rows but the entire grid. For Example 0, three rows meet the condition (rows 1,2,5). But the output has two 1s. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the output is the count of the number of times the pattern occurs in each column. Let's check columns for Example 0:\n\nLooking for columns that have both a 1-pair and a 2-pair. For each column in Example 0's input:\n\nColumn 0: 0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0 \u2192 no pairs.\n\nColumn 1: 0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1 \u2192 1-pair in rows 1-2 and a single 1 in row 8. So two 1s but not consecutive. So no pair here.\n\nColumn 2: 0,1,1,0,2,2,0,0,0 \u2192 1-pair in rows 1-2 and 2-pair in rows 4-5. So this column has both pairs. So condition met.\n\nColumn 3: 0,0,0,0,2,2,0,0,0 \u2192 2-pair in rows 4-5.\n\nColumn 4: 2,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0 \u2192 2-pair in row 0-1.\n\nColumn 5: 2,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0 \u2192 2-pair in row 0-1.\n\nOther columns may have different patterns. So if the output corresponds to columns 0-4, but column 2 meets the condition. So the output would have 1 in the third position (if 0-indexed). But Example 0's output is [1,1,0,0,0]. Doesn't align.\n\nAlternative idea: The output might represent the number of 1-pairs and 2-pairs in each row. But the output is a binary array. Alternatively, maybe each output element is 1 if the corresponding row (or column) has at least one 1-pair and at least one 2-pair. Then, for the first five rows (or columns) of the input, the output elements correspond to those. \n\nFor Example 0, checking first five rows:\n\nRow 0: 0s and 2-pair \u2192 no 1-pair \u2192 0\n\nRow 1: 1-pair and 2-pair \u21921\n\nRow 2: 1-pair and 2-pair \u21921\n\nRow 3: 2-pair \u21920\n\nRow 4: 2-pair \u21920\n\nSo output would be [0,1,1,0,0], but the actual output is [1,1,0,0,0]. Doesn't match.\n\nHmm. Let's try looking for a different pattern. Maybe the output is related to the number of \"blocks\" of 1s and 2s. For instance, each 1 in the output indicates that in a certain diagonal or quadrant, there's a 1-block followed by a 2-block.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is generated by looking for sequences of 1s and 2s in the rows, but in a specific order. For example, a row that has a 1-pair followed by a 2-pair (not necessarily adjacent) would contribute to the output. Then, the output elements might count how many such rows exist up to that point. But this is getting convoluted.\n\nWait, looking at the test input:\n\nTest input rows:\n\nRow 0: [0,0,0,0,0,2,2,0,1] \u2192 2-pair at 5-6.\n\nRow 1: [1,1,0,1,0,2,2,0,0] \u2192 1-pair at 0-1, 2-pair at 5-6. Also a single 1 at index 3.\n\nRow 2: [1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0] \u2192 1-pair at 0-1.\n\nRow 3: [0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0] \u2192 1-pair at 5-6.\n\nRow 4: [0,2,2,0,0,1,1,0,0] \u2192 2-pair at 1-2 and 1-pair at 5-6.\n\nRow 5: [0,2,2,0,0,0,0,0,0] \u2192 2-pair at 1-2.\n\nRow 6: [1,0,0,0,0,0,2,2,0] \u2192 2-pair at 6-7.\n\nRow 7: [2,2,0,1,1,0,2,2,0] \u2192 2-pair at 0-1, 1-pair at 3-4, 2-pair at 6-7.\n\nRow 8: [2,2,0,1,1,0,0,0,0] \u2192 2-pair at 0-1, 1-pair at 3-4.\n\nIf the output is determined by the number of rows in the first five rows that have both 1-pair and 2-pair:\n\nTest input first five rows:\n\nRow 0: 2-pair only \u2192 no.\n\nRow 1: 1-pair and 2-pair \u2192 yes.\n\nRow 2: 1-pair only \u2192 no.\n\nRow 3: 1-pair only \u2192 no.\n\nRow 4: both pairs \u2192 yes.\n\nSo two such rows. So output would be [1,1,0,0,0], but looking at the examples, when there are two qualifying rows, like in Example 0, the output starts with two 1s. But Example 1's output has four 1s, which would mean four qualifying rows. However, when I checked Example 1's first five rows, only row 4 qualifies. But in the entire grid, there are four qualifying rows (rows 4,5,7,8). So perhaps the output counts the number of qualifying rows in the entire grid, up to five. So if there are two qualifying rows, the output is [1,1,0,0,0]. For four qualifying rows, [1,1,1,1,0]. For three rows, [1,1,1,0,0], etc.\n\nTesting this theory:\n\nExample 0 has three qualifying rows (rows 1,2,5). Wait, but according to earlier analysis, rows 1,2,5, and maybe others? Let's re-examine Example 0's input:\n\nRow 1: [0,1,1,0,2,2,0,0,0] \u2192 1-pair and 2-pair \u2192 yes.\n\nRow 2: [0,1,1,0,0,0,0,2,2] \u2192 1-pair and 2-pair \u2192 yes.\n\nRow 5: [0,0,2,2,0,1,1,0,0] \u2192 2-pair and 1-pair \u2192 yes.\n\nSo three rows. But the output is [1,1,0,0,0]. Hmm, this doesn't fit. Because three would require three 1s. So maybe the output is capped at five, but Example 0 has three, output is two 1s. So this theory isn't correct.\n\nAlternative idea: Maybe the output elements correspond to the first five rows, but each element indicates whether that row has both a 1-pair and a 2-pair. For Example 0's first five rows:\n\nRow 0: no \u2192 0\n\nRow 1: yes \u21921\n\nRow 2: yes \u21921\n\nRow 3: no \u21920\n\nRow 4: no \u21920\n\nSo output would be [0,1,1,0,0], but the actual output is [1,1,0,0,0]. So that's not matching.\n\nWait, perhaps the output is not about pairs but about sequences of 1s and 2s. For example, each 1 in the output indicates that in the corresponding row, a 1 occurs before a 2. But that's vague.\n\nAnother approach: Maybe the output is derived from the columns. Let's check Example 0's columns for patterns. For instance, if a column contains both a 1-pair and a 2-pair. For Example 0:\n\nColumn 0: [0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0] \u2192 single 1. No pairs.\n\nColumn 1: [0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1] \u2192 1-pair in rows 1-2 and a single 1 in row 8.\n\nColumn 2: [0,1,1,0,2,2,0,0,0] \u2192 1-pair in rows 1-2 and 2-pair in rows 4-5.\n\nColumn 3: [0,0,0,0,2,2,0,0,0] \u2192 2-pair in rows 4-5.\n\nColumn 4: [2,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0] \u2192 2-pair in rows 0-1.\n\nSo column 2 in Example 0 has both 1-pair and 2-pair. If the output corresponds to the first five columns, then column 2 would be the third element. But Example 0's output is [1,1,0,0,0], which doesn't match. Hmm.\n\nAlternative idea: Maybe the output represents the presence of a 1-pair and a 2-pair in the same row, regardless of order, and the output array is built by checking each row in the entire grid and counting how many meet the condition, then the output array has a 1 for each count up to five. For example, if three rows meet the condition, the output is [1,1,1,0,0]. Let's check Example 0:\n\nThree rows meet the condition (1,2,5). So output would be [1,1,1,0,0], but the actual output is [1,1,0,0,0]. So that doesn't fit.\n\nExample 1 has four qualifying rows (rows 4,5,7,8), output is [1,1,1,1,0], which fits. So perhaps the output is the cumulative count up to five. So:\n\n- 1st element: 1 if count >=1\n- 2nd: 1 if count >=2\n- 3rd: 1 if count >=3\n- and so on.\n\nIn Example 0: count is 3. So output would be [1,1,1,0,0]. But actual output is [1,1,0,0,0]. Doesn't match.\n\nHmm. I'm stuck. Let's try another angle. Maybe the output corresponds to the number of times a 1-pair and a 2-pair appear in the same row, but the pairs are adjacent. For example, the row has 1,1,2,2 in sequence. Let's check Example 0's rows:\n\nRow 1: [0,1,1,0,2,2,0,0,0]. So 1-pair followed by 2-pair with a 0 in between. Not adjacent.\n\nRow 2: [0,1,1,0,0,0,0,2,2]. 1-pair and 2-pair separated by zeros.\n\nRow 5: [0,0,2,2,0,1,1,0,0]. 2-pair followed by 1-pair.\n\nSo none of these rows have adjacent 1-pair and 2-pair. So this theory is invalid.\n\nAnother possibility: Maybe the output represents the number of rows where the 1-pair comes before the 2-pair. For Example 0, rows 1,2,5. Rows 1 and 2 have 1-pair before 2-pair. Row 5 has 2-pair before 1-pair. So count is 2. Then output would be [1,1,0,0,0], which matches Example 0. Example 1's qualifying rows (4,5,7,8):\n\nRow4: 1-pair before 2-pair \u2192 yes.\n\nRow5: 1-pair before 2-pair (1-pair at 1-2, 2-pair at 4-5) \u2192 yes.\n\nRow7: 2-pair at 3-4, 1-pair at 6-7 \u2192 2 before 1 \u2192 no.\n\nRow8: 2-pair at 0-1, 1-pair at 3-4 \u2192 2 before 1 \u2192 no.\n\nSo count is 2. But Example 1's output is [1,1,1,1,0]. This doesn't match. So this theory is incorrect.\n\nWait, maybe the output is counting the number of 2-pairs that appear after a 1-pair in the entire grid, not per row. Like, for each 1-pair, check if there's a 2-pair somewhere to the right in the same row. For Example 0, rows 1 and 2 have 1-pairs followed by 2-pairs. Row5 has 2-pairs followed by 1-pairs. So two instances. So output [1,1,0,0,0]. Example 1 has row4 and row5 where 1-pair is before 2-pair. Rows7 and8 have 2-pairs before 1-pairs. So two instances again. But Example 1's output is four 1s. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternative idea: Maybe the output is the counts of 1-pairs and 2-pairs in the entire grid. For example, first element is the number of 1-pairs, second the number of 2-pairs, etc. But the output length is five. Example 0:\n\nCounting 1-pairs: rows1,2,5,6 \u2192 four pairs. 2-pairs: rows0,1,2,3,4,5 \u2192 six pairs. But output is [1,1,0,0,0]. Doesn't match.\n\nHmm. Let's try looking for another pattern. Maybe the output is related to the positions of 1s and 2s. For instance, the output could be a binary encoding of certain positions. For example, each element in the output corresponds to a specific cell in the grid, but with five elements, it's unclear.\n\nAnother approach: The output arrays in the examples have five elements. Example 0's output is [1,1,0,0,0]. Example 1 and 2 have [1,1,1,1,0]. Maybe the output represents the presence of certain sequences in the grid. For example, each 1 in the output indicates a certain pattern exists. Let's see:\n\nExample 0's output has two 1s. Maybe there are two instances of a particular pattern. Example 1's output has four 1s. Let's look for patterns that occur two, four, and four times in the respective examples.\n\nPossible pattern: a 2x2 block of 1s followed by a 2x2 block of 2s. But looking at Example 0's input, I don't see such blocks.\n\nAlternatively, the number of times a row contains both 1 and 2 pairs, regardless of order. For Example 0, three rows meet this (rows1,2,5). Output has two 1s. Doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, the output elements represent the number of times a certain consecutive sequence appears in the grid. For example, '1,1,2,2' in sequence. Looking for this in Example 0's rows:\n\nRow1: 1,1,0,2,2 \u2192 has 1,1 followed by 0, so not '1,1,2,2'.\n\nRow2: 1,1,0,0,0,0,2,2 \u2192 no.\n\nRow5: 2,2,0,1,1 \u2192 no.\n\nSo no such sequences. So this isn't it.\n\nAnother Idea: The output could be based on the diagonals of the grid. For instance, each element in the output represents whether a certain diagonal contains both 1s and 2s. But with five elements, perhaps the main diagonals and some others. For a 9x9 grid, the main diagonals are length 9. Maybe shorter diagonals are considered. This seems complex, but let's check.\n\nFor Example 0's main diagonal (0,0 to 8,8): entries are 0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1. Contains 1s but no 2s. Other diagonal (0,8 to 8,0): entries are 1,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0. Contains a 2. So not both.\n\nPerhaps checking other diagonals. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is related to the number of times the digits 1 and 2 appear in the same row. For example, each output element corresponds to a row, and is 1 if the row has both 1s and 2s. Let's see:\n\nExample 0's rows:\n\nRow0: has 2s and a 1 \u2192 yes.\n\nRow1: has 1s and 2s \u2192 yes.\n\nRow2: has 1s and 2s \u2192 yes.\n\nRow3: has 2s \u2192 no.\n\nRow4: has 2s \u2192 no.\n\nRow5: has 1s and 2s \u2192 yes.\n\nRow6: has 1s \u2192 no.\n\nRow7: has 0s \u2192 no.\n\nRow8: has 1s \u2192 no.\n\nSo rows 0,1,2,5 have both 1s and 2s. Four rows. But the output is [1,1,0,0,0]. Doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, the output counts the number of rows where 1s appear before 2s. For Example 0, rows0 (0,0,0,0,2,2,0,0,1) \u2192 2s before 1 \u2192 no. Row1: 1s before 2s \u2192 yes. Row2: 1s before 2s \u2192 yes. Row5: 2s before 1s \u2192 no. So two such rows. Output is [1,1,0,0,0]. This matches. Example 1's output is [1,1,1,1,0], which would mean four such rows. Let's check Example 1:\n\nRows that have 1s before 2s:\n\nRow0: 1,1,0,2 \u2192 1s before 2 \u2192 yes.\n\nRow4: 0,1,1,0,2,2 \u2192 yes.\n\nRow5: 0,1,1,0,2,2 \u2192 yes.\n\nRow7: 0,0,0,2,2,0,1,1 \u2192 2s before 1s \u2192 no.\n\nRow8: 0,1,0,2,2 \u2192 1 before 2 \u2192 yes.\n\nSo rows0,4,5,8 \u2192 four instances. Output is four 1s \u2192 [1,1,1,1,0]. This matches.\n\nExample 2's output is also [1,1,1,1,0]. Let's check Example 2's input for rows where 1s appear before 2s:\n\nLooking through Example 2's rows:\n\nRow0: [2,2,0,1,1,0,0,0,0] \u2192 2s before 1s \u2192 no.\n\nRow1: [2,2,0,1,1,0,0,1,1] \u2192 2s before 1s \u2192 no.\n\nRow2: [1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1] \u2192 no 2s \u2192 no.\n\nRow3: [0,2,2,0,0,0,0,0,0] \u2192 no 1s \u2192 no.\n\nRow4: [0,2,2,0,1,1,0,1,0] \u2192 2s before 1s \u2192 no.\n\nRow5: [0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0] \u2192 no 2s \u2192 no.\n\nRow6: [0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0] \u2192 single 2 \u2192 no.\n\nRow7: [0,1,1,0,0,0,0,2,2] \u2192 1s before 2s \u2192 yes.\n\nRow8: [0,1,1,0,0,1,0,2,2] \u2192 1s before 2s \u2192 yes.\n\nSo rows7 and 8 qualify. That's two instances, but the output is four 1s. So this theory doesn't hold for Example 2.\n\nHmm, inconsistency here. But Example 1's output fits, Example 0's fits. So maybe there's another layer to the pattern. Wait, perhaps the rows where 1s appear before 2s and both are in pairs. Let's revisit Example 0:\n\nRow1: 1-pair before 2-pair \u2192 yes.\n\nRow2: 1-pair before 2-pair \u2192 yes.\n\nRow5: 2-pair before 1-pair \u2192 no.\n\nSo two rows. Output [1,1,0,0,0].\n\nExample 1:\n\nRow0: 1-pair and then a single 2 \u2192 not a pair. So no.\n\nRow4: 1-pair before 2-pair \u2192 yes.\n\nRow5: 1-pair before 2-pair \u2192 yes.\n\nRow8: 2-pair before 1-pair \u2192 no.\n\nWait, row8 in Example1: [0,1,0,2,2,0,1,1,0] \u2192 2-pair at 3-4, 1-pair at 6-7 \u2192 2s before 1s. So no.\n\nSo in Example1, rows4 and5 qualify. So two instances, but output is four 1s. So this theory is invalid.\n\nI'm really stuck here. Maybe I should look for another pattern. Let's consider that the output represents the number of rows where there are more 1-pairs than 2-pairs, but this seems arbitrary.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is derived from the counts of 1s and 2s in specific positions. For example, each element in the output corresponds to a certain cell in the grid. But with five elements, which cells? Maybe the first five cells of the middle row. Example 0's middle row (row4) is [1,0,2,2,0,0,0,0,0]. The first five elements are 1,0,2,2,0. How does this translate to the output [1,1,0,0,0]? Not clear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the counts of 1s in the first five columns. For Example 0:\n\nColumns 0-4:\n\nColumn0: sum is 1 (only row4 has 1)\n\nColumn1: sum of 1s: 3 (rows1,2,8)\n\nColumn2: sum of 1s: 2 (rows1,2)\n\nColumn3: sum of 0s.\n\nColumn4: sum of 2s (0,2,0,0,0).\n\nBut output is [1,1,0,0,0]. Not matching.\n\nAnother Idea: The output might be based on the presence of certain sequences in the diagonal from top-left to bottom-right. For example, the output elements indicate whether certain positions along this diagonal are 1 or 2. But the diagonal has nine elements, and the output has five. Maybe the first five elements of the diagonal. Let's check Example 0's diagonal:\n\n0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1 \u2192 first five are 0,1,0,0,0. So output would be [0,1,0,0,0], but the actual output is [1,1,0,0,0]. Doesn't match.\n\nAlternatively, the sum of the first five diagonal elements. 0+1+0+0+0=1. Output is [1,1,0,0,0]. No.\n\nAlternatively, each output element is 1 if the corresponding diagonal cell is non-zero. For Example 0's first five diagonal cells: 0,1,0,0,0 \u2192 output [0,1,0,0,0]. Still no.\n\nAnother approach: Maybe the output is the binary representation of the number of rows that have at least one 1 and one 2. For Example 0, four rows (0,1,2,5) \u2192 binary 100, but output is five bits. Not matching.\n\nAlternatively, the output is the parity (even or odd) of certain counts. For Example 0, four rows with both 1 and 2 \u2192 even, output starts with 1. Not sure.\n\nI'm running out of ideas. Let's try to look at the test input and see if applying the pattern from the examples gives the expected output.\n\nTest input has the following rows:\n\nRow0: 0,0,0,0,0,2,2,0,1 \u2192 2-pair at 5-6. No 1-pair. \u2192 no.\n\nRow1: 1,1,0,1,0,2,2,0,0 \u2192 1-pair at 0-1, 2-pair at 5-6. So yes.\n\nRow2: 1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0 \u2192 1-pair only \u2192 no.\n\nRow3: 0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0 \u2192 1-pair only \u2192 no.\n\nRow4: 0,2,2,0,0,1,1,0,0 \u2192 2-pair at 1-2 and 1-pair at 5-6 \u2192 yes.\n\nRow5: 0,2,2,0,0,0,0,0,0 \u2192 2-pair \u2192 no 1-pair.\n\nRow6: 1,0,0,0,0,0,2,2,0 \u2192 2-pair at 6-7. No 1-pair (only single 1).\n\nRow7: 2,2,0,1,1,0,2,2,0 \u2192 2-pairs at 0-1 and 6-7, 1-pair at 3-4 \u2192 yes.\n\nRow8: 2,2,0,1,1,0,0,0,0 \u2192 2-pair at 0-1, 1-pair at 3-4 \u2192 yes.\n\nSo rows 1,4,7,8 meet the condition (1-pair and 2-pair in the same row). That's four instances. According to Example 1's pattern, four instances would result in [1,1,1,1,0]. But let's check the training examples:\n\nExample 0 has three rows meeting the condition but output is [1,1,0,0,0]. Example1 has four rows and output [1,1,1,1,0]. So it seems the output is a binary array where each element is 1 if there are at least that many instances (starting from 1). So for four instances, output is [1,1,1,1,0], for three instances, [1,1,1,0,0]. But Example0 has three instances and output [1,1,0,0,0]. This contradicts. So perhaps there's another factor.\n\nWait, in Example0's output, the third element is 0 despite three instances. So perhaps the output is the first five elements of a binary array where each bit represents whether there's an instance in the corresponding row. For example, the output is [row0, row1, row2, row3, row4], each being 1 if the row has both pairs. Example0's rows 0-4: row1 and row2 meet the condition. So output [0,1,1,0,0]. But the actual output is [1,1,0,0,0]. Doesn't match.\n\nAlternatively, the output is the first five rows that have both pairs, regardless of their position. So for Example0, rows1 and 2 are the first two, hence first two elements are 1. The rest are 0. That fits Example0's output. For Example1, if the first four rows that meet the condition are rows4,5,7,8. But the first five rows (0-4) would only have row4. But Example1's output is [1,1,1,1,0], which suggests four 1s. So this theory doesn't hold.\n\nPerhaps the answer is that the output array indicates whether each of the first five rows contains both a 1-pair and a 2-pair. For the test input:\n\nFirst five rows:\n\nRow0: no \u21920\n\nRow1: yes \u21921\n\nRow2: no \u21920\n\nRow3: no \u21920\n\nRow4: yes \u21921\n\nSo output would be [0,1,0,0,1]. But none of the examples match this structure. Example0's first five rows have rows1 and 2 meeting the condition, which would give [0,1,1,0,0], but the actual output is [1,1,0,0,0]. So this is not the case.\n\nAt this point, I think the pattern is that the output array's elements are 1 for each row in the entire grid that contains both a 1-pair and a 2-pair, up to five elements. So if there are four such rows, the output is [1,1,1,1,0], as in Example1. For the test input, we have rows1,4,7,8 \u2192 four rows, so output [1,1,1,1,0].\n\nBut wait, in the test input:\n\nRow1: yes.\n\nRow4: yes.\n\nRow7: yes.\n\nRow8: yes.\n\nThat's four rows. So output would be [1,1,1,1,0], as per Example1 and Example2.\n\nBut in Example0, there are three such rows (rows1,2,5), so output would be [1,1,1,0,0], but the actual output is [1,1,0,0,0]. So this theory is invalid. Therefore, there must be another pattern.\n\nWait, perhaps the output is the count of rows where there's a 1-pair followed by a 2-pair (regardless of what's in between). So for Example0:\n\nRow1: 1-pair then 2-pair \u2192 yes.\n\nRow2: 1-pair then 2-pair \u2192 yes.\n\nRow5: 2-pair then 1-pair \u2192 no.\n\nSo two rows. Output is [1,1,0,0,0]. Example1:\n\nRow4: 1-pair then 2-pair \u2192 yes.\n\nRow5: 1-pair then 2-pair \u2192 yes.\n\nRow7: 2-pair then 1-pair \u2192 no.\n\nRow8: 2-pair then 1-pair \u2192 no.\n\nSo two rows. But Example1's output is four 1s. Doesn't fit.\n\nAnother Idea: Perhaps the output corresponds to the number of columns that contain both a 1-pair and a 2-pair. For Example0's columns:\n\nColumn2: yes.\n\nSo one column. Output would be [1,0,0,0,0]. Not matching.\n\nExample1's columns:\n\nColumns where both pairs exist.\n\nLooking at Example1's columns:\n\nColumn3: row7 and8 have 2-pair. row0 has 2. No 1-pair.\n\nColumn4: row4 and5 have 2-pairs. row7 and8 have 1-pairs. So column4 has both 2-pair and 1-pair in different rows. Not in the same column.\n\nNot sure.\n\nGiven that I'm stuck, and considering that the test input has four rows meeting the condition of having both 1-pair and 2-pair (rows1,4,7,8), and the output for four instances in training examples is [1,1,1,1,0], I'll conclude that the pattern is the number of such rows, and the output is a binary array with 1s up to that count. So the test input's output would be [1,1,1,1,0]."
