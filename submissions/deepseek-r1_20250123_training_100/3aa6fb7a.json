        "cot_1": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. So, looking at the training examples, I need to see how the input grids are transformed into the output grids. Let's start with Example 0.\n\nIn the input of Example 0, there are 8s arranged in certain positions. The output has some 8s replaced with 1s. Let me look at where those 1s are. In the input's second row, there's an 8 at position (1,1) (assuming rows and columns start at 0). In the output, the cell to the right of that 8 (position 1,2) becomes a 1. Then, in the fourth row of the input, there are two 8s at positions (3,4) and (3,5). In the output, the cell below (3,5) which is (4,5) becomes a 1. Wait, no. Let me check again. The input's fourth row is [0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0], and the output's fourth row is the same, but the fifth row (index 4) has a 1 at position (4,4). Wait, the fifth row's input is [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0], so the output changes the 8 at (4,5) to a 1? No, in the output, it's [0,0,0,0,1,8,0]. So the 8 at (4,5) stays, and the position (4,4) becomes 1. Hmm. How does that relate to the input?\n\nWait, maybe the 1s are placed in positions adjacent to exactly two 8s. Let me check. For Example 0, the 1 in row 1, column 2: adjacent cells would be up, down, left, right. Let's see. The original 8 is at (1,1). The cell to the right is (1,2), which becomes 1. What's around (1,2)? The left cell is 8, the up is (0,2) which is 0, down is (2,2) which is 8. So maybe if a cell has two 8s adjacent, it becomes 1. Wait, but (1,2) is adjacent to 8 on the left and 8 below. So two 8s. So that cell becomes 1. Similarly, in Example 0's output, the other 1 is at (4,4). Let's look at the input for that cell. The input's row 4 is [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0]. So (4,4) is 0 in input. Then in the output, it's 1. What's adjacent to (4,4)? Above is (3,4) which is 8, and to the right is (4,5) which is 8. So two 8s adjacent. So the cell becomes 1.\n\nSo the rule might be: for each cell in the grid, if the cell is 0 and has exactly two adjacent 8s (maybe orthogonally adjacent, not diagonal), then it becomes 1. Otherwise, it stays the same. Let's check this with Example 1.\n\nLooking at Example 1's input. The output has 1s at positions (1,4), (2,3), (5,3). Let's check each. For (1,4): adjacent cells. Up is row 0, column 4 which is 8. Down is row 2, column 4 which is 0. Left is (1,3) which is 0. Right is (1,5) which is 8. So adjacent 8s are up and right: two, so becomes 1. Correct. (2,3): adjacent cells. Up is (1,3) which is 0. Down is (3,3) which is 8. Left is (2,2) which is 8. Right is (2,4) which is 0. So adjacent 8s are down and left: two, becomes 1. (5,3): adjacent cells. Up is (4,3) which is 0. Down is (6,3) which is 8. Left is (5,2) which is 0. Right is (5,4) which is 8. So adjacent 8s are down and right: two, becomes 1. That seems to fit.\n\nSo the pattern is: for each cell, if the cell is 0 and exactly two of its orthogonal neighbors (up, down, left, right) are 8s, then it becomes 1. Otherwise, it remains the same (8 stays 8, 0 stays 0 unless two 8s around).\n\nNow, let's apply this to the test input.\n\nThe test input is a 7x7 grid. Let's go row by row and check each 0 cell to see if it has exactly two adjacent 8s.\n\nStarting with the first row: [0,0,0,0,0,8,8]. Let's check each 0. For example, position (0,4): neighbors are (0,3)=0, (0,5)=8, (1,4)=0. So only one 8. Not two. The next cell (0,5) is 8, so we skip. Next, cell (0,3) is 0. Neighbors: left, right, up, down. Up is out of bounds. Down is (1,3)=0. Left is (0,2)=0, right (0,4)=0. No 8s. So no change.\n\nMoving to the second row: [8,8,0,0,0,0,8]. Check each 0. For example, position (1,2): neighbors. Left is 8 (1,1) and 8 (1,0). Up is (0,2)=0. Down is (2,2)=0. So left has two 8s? Wait, (1,2) is between (1,1)=8 and (1,3)=0. So left is 8. Right is 0. Up is (0,2)=0. Down (2,2)=0. So adjacent 8s: left (1,1) is 8. Only one. So no change. What about (1,3): neighbors. Left is 0, right is 0. Up (0,3)=0. Down (2,3)=0. No 8s. Similarly, (1,4) is 0. Up (0,4)=0, down (2,4)=0. Left (1,3)=0, right (1,5)=0. No. (1,5)=0. Up (0,5)=8, down (2,5)=0. Left (1,4)=0, right (1,6)=8. So adjacent 8s: up and right. So two. So (1,5) would become 1. Wait, but the cell (1,5) is 0 in input, and has two adjacent 8s (up and right). So in output, this becomes 1. So the second row in output would be [8,8,0,0,0,1,8]. Let me check that.\n\nThird row: [8,0,0,0,0,0,0]. Check each 0. For example, position (2,1): neighbors. Left is 8 (2,0). Right (2,2)=0. Up (1,1)=8. Down (3,1)=0. So adjacent 8s: left and up. Two. So (2,1) would become 1. Wait, but cell (2,1) is 0 in input, and adjacent to 8s on left and up. So becomes 1. Then the third row becomes [8,1,0,0,0,0,0]. Let's see other cells. Position (2,5): neighbors. Up (1,5)=0 (but in input, test input's row 1 is [8,8,0,0,0,0,8], so (1,5) is 0). Down (3,5)=0. Left (2,4)=0. Right (2,6)=0. No. So only (2,1) becomes 1.\n\nFourth row: [0,0,0,8,0,0,0]. Check each 0. For example, position (3,0): neighbors. Right is (3,1)=0. Up (2,0)=8. Down (4,0)=0. So only one 8. (3,1): neighbors. Up (2,1)=0 (but in input, (2,1) is 0, but after processing, maybe it's 1. Wait, no\u2014the processing is done on the original input. Because the transformation is applied to the original input, not incrementally. So when checking neighbors, we look at the original input. So for cell (3,1): up is (2,1) in input which is 0. So adjacent 8s: none. So no change. What about (3,4): neighbors. Left is 8 (3,3). Up (2,4)=0. Down (4,4)=8. Right (3,5)=0. So left and down are 8s. So two. So (3,4) becomes 1. So the fourth row in output would be [0,0,0,8,1,0,0].\n\nFifth row: [0,0,0,8,8,0,0]. Check each 0. For example, (4,2): neighbors. Left (4,1)=0. Right (4,3)=8. Up (3,2)=0. Down (5,2)=0. Only one 8. (4,5): 0. Up (3,5)=0. Down (5,5)=0. Left (4,4)=8. Right (4,6)=0. So one 8. (4,0): neighbors. Right (4,1)=0. Up (3,0)=0. Down (5,0)=0. So no. (4,1): same. So maybe (4,2) and others have no two 8s. Wait, any cell here that's 0 with two 8s? Let's see. (4,5) is 0. Up (3,5)=0. Down (5,5)=0. Left (4,4)=8. Right (4,6)=0. Only one. Hmm. Wait, maybe the cell (4,3) is 8, so not considered. So perhaps no 1s in this row.\n\nSixth row: [0,8,0,0,0,0,0]. Check each 0. (5,0): neighbors. Right (5,1)=8. Up (4,0)=0. Down (6,0)=8. So right and down are 8s. Two. So (5,0) becomes 1. (5,2): neighbors. Left (5,1)=8. Up (4,2)=0. Down (6,2)=0. Right (5,3)=0. So left is 8. Only one. (5,3): 0. Up (4,3)=8. Down (6,3)=0. Left (5,2)=0. Right (5,4)=0. So up is 8. Only one. (5,4): 0. Up (4,4)=8. Down (6,4)=0. So one. (5,5): 0. Up (4,5)=0. Down (6,5)=0. Left (5,4)=0. Right (5,6)=0. No. (5,6): 0. Left (5,5)=0. Up (4,6)=0. Down (6,6)=0. So (5,0) becomes 1. So sixth row becomes [1,8,0,0,0,0,0].\n\nSeventh row: [8,8,0,0,0,0,0]. Check each 0. For example, (6,2): neighbors. Left (6,1)=8. Right (6,3)=0. Up (5,2)=0. Down (out of bounds). So left is 8. Only one. (6,3): neighbors. Left (6,2)=0. Right (6,4)=0. Up (5,3)=0. Down (out). No. (6,4): 0. Up (5,4)=0. So no. So no changes here.\n\nPutting all together, the test input's output would have the following changes:\n\n- Row 1: [8,8,0,0,0,0,8] \u2192 the cell (1,5) becomes 1. So new row: [8,8,0,0,0,1,8]\n\n- Row 2: [8,0,0,0,0,0,0] \u2192 cell (2,1) becomes 1. New row: [8,1,0,0,0,0,0]\n\n- Row 3: [0,0,0,8,0,0,0] \u2192 cell (3,4) becomes 1. New row: [0,0,0,8,1,0,0]\n\n- Row 5: [0,8,0,0,0,0,0] \u2192 cell (5,0) becomes 1. New row: [1,8,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nOther rows remain the same. Let's verify each row:\n\nTest Input rows:\n\n0: [0,0,0,0,0,8,8] \u2192 no changes (no 0 cell with two 8s adjacent). So remains same.\n\n1: [8,8,0,0,0,0,8] \u2192 [8,8,0,0,0,1,8]\n\n2: [8,0,0,0,0,0,0] \u2192 [8,1,0,0,0,0,0]\n\n3: [0,0,0,8,0,0,0] \u2192 [0,0,0,8,1,0,0]\n\n4: [0,0,0,8,8,0,0] \u2192 remains same (no 0s here with two 8s?)\n\nWait, row 4 is [0,0,0,8,8,0,0]. Let's check each 0:\n\n(4,0): neighbors. Right (4,1)=0. Up (3,0)=0. Down (5,0)=0. No 8s. \n\n(4,1): up (3,1)=0. Down (5,1)=8. Left (4,0)=0. Right (4,2)=0. Only down is 8. One.\n\n(4,2): up (3,2)=0. Down (5,2)=0. Left (4,1)=0. Right (4,3)=8. So right is 8. One.\n\n(4,5): 0. Left (4,4)=8. Up (3,5)=0. Down (5,5)=0. Right (4,6)=0. So left is 8. One.\n\nSo no changes in row 4.\n\nRow 5: [0,8,0,0,0,0,0] \u2192 cell (5,0) becomes 1 \u2192 [1,8,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow 6: [8,8,0,0,0,0,0] \u2192 no changes.\n\nPutting all together, the output should be:\n\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8]\n[8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 1, 8]\n[8, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[0, 0, 0, 8, 1, 0, 0]\n[0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0]\n[1, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]",

        "cot_2": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. So, looking at the training examples, I need to see how the input grids are transformed into the output grids. Let's start with Example 0.\n\nIn the input for Example 0, the 8s form some sort of shape. The output has some 8s replaced with 1s. Specifically, in the second row, there's an 8 followed by a 1. Then in the fourth row, the last two 8s are still there, but in the fifth row, the last 8 is replaced by a 1. So maybe it's checking neighboring cells? Like, if an 8 has exactly one adjacent 8, it becomes a 1? Or perhaps it's about the positions where an 8 is part of a \"corner\" or something.\n\nLooking at Example 1's input and output. The output again has 1s where there were 8s. For instance, in the second row, fifth column, an 8 becomes a 1. In the third row, fourth column, an 8 becomes a 1. Also, in the sixth row, fourth column, a 0 becomes a 1. Wait, no\u2014the input there was 0, and in the output it's 1? Let me check. In the test input's sixth row: input is [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0], output is [0, 0, 0, 1, 8, 0, 0]. So the fourth element was 8 and became 1. Hmm. So maybe the 1s are placed in positions where an 8 is adjacent to exactly two other 8s? Or perhaps it's when an 8 is at the end of a line of 8s.\n\nWait, let's look at the cells that turned into 1s. In Example 0's input, the second row has 8 at (1,1) (assuming 0-based index). The output has 8,1,0... So the cell to the right of 8 is 1. Wait, maybe the 1s are placed in cells that are adjacent to exactly one 8. Wait, but in the input for Example 0's second row, the 8 is at (1,1). The cell to the right (1,2) is 0. But in the output, that cell becomes 1. Wait, maybe the 1s are added in cells adjacent to exactly two 8s? Let me check.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's the opposite: existing 8s that have exactly one neighbor are turned into 1s. Wait, but in Example 0's input, the first 8 at (1,1) has a neighbor below (2,1) which is 8, and maybe the one to the right (1,2) is 0. So that 8 has at least one neighbor. But in the output, the cell (1,2) becomes 1. Hmm, maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule is that any cell that is adjacent (horizontally or vertically) to exactly two 8s becomes a 1. Let's check. For Example 0, the cell that becomes 1 in the second row is (1,2). Let's see its neighbors. The cell above is (0,2) which is 0. Below is (2,2) which is 8. Left is (1,1) which is 8. Right is (1,3) which is 0. So adjacent cells: left (8) and below (8). So two 8s. So that would explain why it's a 1. Similarly, in the fifth row, the cell (4,4) becomes 1. Let's check its neighbors. Original input cell (4,5) was 8. Wait, no, in the input for Example 0's fifth row, the row is [0,0,0,0,0,8,0]. So cell (4,5) is 8. Then in the output, it's (4,5) becomes 1. Wait, no, the output's fifth row is [0,0,0,0,1,8,0]. So cell (4,4) is 1. Wait, maybe I'm getting the rows and columns wrong. Let me clarify.\n\nWait, perhaps the rows are 0-based. So in Example 0's input, the second row (row index 1) is [0,8,0,0,0,0,0]. The output for that row is [0,8,1,0,0,0,0]. So cell (1,1) is 8, cell (1,2) becomes 1. So the cell that becomes 1 is adjacent to the 8 at (1,1) and also the 8 at (2,2), perhaps? Wait, no. Cell (1,2) is adjacent to (1,1) (8) on the left, (1,3) (0) on the right, (0,2) (0) above, and (2,2) (8) below. So two 8s adjacent. So that cell (1,2) becomes 1. Similarly, in the fifth row of the input (row index 4), the input is [0,0,0,0,0,8,0]. The output is [0,0,0,0,1,8,0]. So cell (4,4) becomes 1. Let's check the neighbors. Cell (4,4) in the input would have neighbors: (4,3)=0, (4,5)=8, (3,4)=8 (from the fourth row of input which has ... 8,8,0), (5,4)=0. So two 8s adjacent. So that cell becomes 1.\n\nIn Example 1's output, the cell (1,4) becomes 1. Let's see. Input row 1 (second row) is [0,0,0,0,0,8,0]. Output row 1 becomes [0,0,0,0,1,8,0]. So cell (1,4). Neighbors: (0,4)=8 (from input row 0, which is [0,0,0,0,8,8,0]), (1,3)=0, (1,5)=8, (2,4)=0. So adjacent 8s above (row 0, col 4) and right (col 5). So two 8s. So cell becomes 1.\n\nAnother example in Example 1's output: row 2, column 3 (cell (2,3)) becomes 1. Input for row 2 is [0,0,8,0,0,0,0]. So cell (2,2) is 8. The output cell (2,3) is 1. Let's check neighbors. For cell (2,3): left is (2,2)=8, right (2,4)=0, up (1,3)=0, down (3,3)=8 (since input row 3 is [0,0,8,8,0,0,0]). So adjacent cells: left 8 and down 8. So two 8s. So becomes 1.\n\nSimilarly, in the sixth row of Example 1's input (row 5), the input is [0,0,0,0,8,0,0]. The output becomes [0,0,0,1,8,0,0]. So cell (5,3) becomes 1. Let's check neighbors. Cell (5,3): left is (5,2)=0, right (5,4)=8. Up (4,3)=0 (input row 4 is all zeros). Down (6,3)=8 (since input row 6 is [0,0,0,8,8,0,0]). So neighbors are right (8) and down (8). Two 8s, so becomes 1.\n\nSo the pattern seems to be: for each cell in the grid, if the cell is 0 and has exactly two 8s adjacent (orthogonally, maybe diagonally?), then it becomes 1. Or wait, no. Wait in all these cases, the cells that become 1 are 0s in the input. So the rule is: if a cell is 0 and has exactly two orthogonally adjacent 8s (up, down, left, right), then it becomes 1. And the 8s remain unless they are part of this condition? Wait no, but in Example 0's output, some 8s remain. So the 8s are kept unless they are converted into 1s. But in the examples, the 1s are only in cells that were 0 in the input. So the rule might be: turn any 0 cell into 1 if it has exactly two adjacent 8s (orthogonally). But in Example 0, cell (1,2) becomes 1. It was 0. Adjacent to two 8s. Similarly for others.\n\nSo the transformation is: for each 0 cell, count the number of adjacent 8s (orthogonal directions). If the count is exactly two, then replace the 0 with 1. All 8s remain as 8s, except if they need to be replaced by 1s. Wait, but in the output examples, the 8s are still there. So the 8s are unchanged, and 0s become 1s if adjacent to two 8s.\n\nTesting this hypothesis. Let's take Example 0's input. The cell (1,2) is 0. Adjacent to (1,1)=8 and (2,2)=8. That's two, so becomes 1. The cell (4,4) in input is 0. Adjacent to (4,5)=8 (input row 4: [0,0,0,0,0,8,0]) and (3,4)=8 (from row 3: [0,0,0,0,8,8,0]. So (3,4) is 8. So two 8s. So becomes 1. That matches the output.\n\nIn Example 1, cell (1,4) is 0 in input. Adjacent to (0,4)=8 (row 0, column 4) and (1,5)=8. So two 8s. Becomes 1. Similarly cell (2,3) is 0. Adjacent to (2,2)=8 and (3,3)=8. So two, becomes 1. Cell (5,3) is 0. Adjacent to (5,4)=8 and (6,3)=8. So two, becomes 1. All these match the outputs.\n\nSo the pattern is: in the input grid, for each cell that is 0, if it has exactly two orthogonally adjacent 8s, then it becomes 1 in the output. All other cells remain the same.\n\nNow, applying this to the test input.\n\nTest Input:\n\nRow 0: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8]\nRow 1: [8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8]\nRow 2: [8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\nRow 3: [0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0]\nRow 4: [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0]\nRow 5: [0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\nRow 6: [8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nWe need to go through each cell and check if it's 0 and has exactly two 8 neighbors (orthogonal).\n\nLet's go cell by cell.\n\nRow 0:\n\n0:0,0 \u2192 check each cell.\n\nRow 0, column 0: 0. Check adjacent cells (up is none, down to row 1, column 0 (8), left none, right column 1 (0). So only one 8. So no change.\n\nRow 0, column 1: 0. Adjacent cells: up none, down row1, col1 (8), left col0 (0), right col2 (0). So one 8. No change.\n\nRow 0, column 2: 0. Adjacent: down row1, col2 (0), left col1 (0), right col3 (0), up none. All zeros. No change.\n\nRow0, col3: 0. Adjacents: down row1, col3 (0). Others: left col2 (0), right col4 (0). All zeros. No.\n\nRow0, col4: 0. Adjacent: down row1, col4 (0), left col3 (0), right col5 (8). So right neighbor is 8. And up none. So only one 8. No change.\n\nRow0, col5: 8. Not a 0. So skip.\n\nRow0, col6: 8. Skip.\n\nRow 1:\n\nRow1, col0: 8. Skip.\n\nRow1, col1: 8. Skip.\n\nRow1, col2: 0. Check neighbors:\n\nup row0, col2 (0), down row2, col2 (0), left col1 (8), right col3 (0). Left is 8. So count is 1. No change.\n\nRow1, col3: 0. Neighbors: up row0, col3 (0), down row2, col3 (0), left col2 (0), right col4 (0). All zeros. No.\n\nRow1, col4: 0. Neighbors: up row0, col4 (0), down row2, col4 (0), left col3 (0), right col5 (0). No 8s. No change.\n\nRow1, col5: 0. Neighbors: up row0, col5 (8), down row2, col5 (0), left col4 (0), right col6 (8). So two 8s (up and right). So this cell is 0 and has two 8s adjacent. So becomes 1.\n\nWait, row1, col5 is 0. Adjacent cells: up (row0, col5=8), right (row1, col6=8). So two 8s. So this cell becomes 1.\n\nRow1, col6: 8. Skip.\n\nSo row1's output will have a 1 at col5.\n\nRow 2:\n\nRow2, col0: 8. Skip.\n\nRow2, col1: 0. Neighbors: up row1, col1 (8), down row3, col1 (0), left col0 (8), right col2 (0). So up and left are 8s. Two 8s. So this cell becomes 1.\n\nRow2, col2: 0. Neighbors: up row1, col2 (0), down row3, col2 (0), left col1 (0), right col3 (0). No 8s.\n\nRow2, col3: 0. Neighbors: up row1, col3 (0), down row3, col3 (8), left col2 (0), right col4 (0). Down is 8. So one 8. No change.\n\nRow2, col4: 0. Neighbors: up row1, col4 (0), down row3, col4 (0), left col3 (0), right col5 (0). No 8s.\n\nRow2, col5: 0. Neighbors: up row1, col5 (0\u2192 but in input it's 0, but in the output of row1, it's 1. Wait no, wait in the test input, row1, col5 is 0. So neighbors here are up (row1, col5=0), down (row3, col5=0), left col4 (0), right col6 (0). So no 8s.\n\nRow2, col6: 0. Neighbors: up row1, col6 (8), left col5 (0), down row3, col6 (0). So up is 8. Only one. No change.\n\nSo in row2, col1 becomes 1.\n\nRow3:\n\nRow3, col0: 0. Neighbors: up row2, col0 (8), down row4, col0 (0), left none, right col1 (0). Up is 8. Only one. No change.\n\nRow3, col1: 0. Neighbors: up row2, col1 (0), down row4, col1 (0), left col0 (0), right col2 (0). No 8s.\n\nRow3, col2: 0. Same, neighbors are zeros.\n\nRow3, col3: 8. Skip.\n\nRow3, col4: 0. Neighbors: up row2, col4 (0), down row4, col4 (8), left col3 (8), right col5 (0). Left and down are 8s. So two 8s. So this cell becomes 1.\n\nRow3, col5: 0. Neighbors: up row2, col5 (0), down row4, col5 (0), left col4 (0), right col6 (0). No.\n\nRow3, col6: 0. Neighbors: up row2, col6 (0), down row4, col6 (0), left col5 (0). So no 8s.\n\nSo row3, col4 becomes 1.\n\nRow4:\n\nRow4, col0: 0. Neighbors: up row3, col0 (0), down row5, col0 (0), left none, right col1 (0). No.\n\nRow4, col1: 0. Neighbors: up row3, col1 (0), down row5, col1 (8), left col0 (0), right col2 (0). Down is 8. One.\n\nRow4, col2: 0. Neighbors: up row3, col2 (0), down row5, col2 (0), left col1 (0), right col3 (8). Right is 8. So one.\n\nRow4, col3: 8. Skip.\n\nRow4, col4: 8. Skip.\n\nRow4, col5: 0. Neighbors: up row3, col5 (0), down row5, col5 (0), left col4 (8), right col6 (0). Left is 8. One.\n\nRow4, col6: 0. Neighbors: up row3, col6 (0), down row5, col6 (0), left col5 (0). No.\n\nSo row4 has no changes except maybe col2? Wait, row4, col2 is 0. Right neighbor col3 is 8. So one 8. Not two. So no.\n\nRow5:\n\nRow5, col0: 0. Neighbors: up row4, col0 (0), down row6, col0 (8), left none, right col1 (8). So down (8) and right (8). Two 8s. So becomes 1.\n\nRow5, col1: 8. Skip.\n\nRow5, col2: 0. Neighbors: up row4, col2 (0), down row6, col2 (0), left col1 (8), right col3 (0). Left is 8. One.\n\nRow5, col3: 0. Neighbors: up row4, col3 (8), down row6, col3 (0), left col2 (0), right col4 (0). Up is 8. One.\n\nRow5, col4: 0. Neighbors: up row4, col4 (8), down row6, col4 (0), left col3 (0), right col5 (0). Up is 8. One.\n\nRow5, col5: 0. Neighbors: up row4, col5 (0), down row6, col5 (0), left col4 (0), right col6 (0). No.\n\nRow5, col6: 0. Neighbors: up row4, col6 (0), down row6, col6 (0), left col5 (0). No.\n\nSo row5, col0 becomes 1.\n\nRow6:\n\nRow6, col0: 8. Skip.\n\nRow6, col1: 8. Skip.\n\nRow6, col2: 0. Neighbors: up row5, col2 (0), down none, left col1 (8), right col3 (0). Left is 8. One.\n\nRow6, col3: 0. Neighbors: up row5, col3 (0), down none, left col2 (0), right col4 (0). No.\n\nRow6, col4: 0. Neighbors: up row5, col4 (0), down none, left col3 (0), right col5 (0). No.\n\nRow6, col5: 0. Neighbors: up row5, col5 (0), down none, left col4 (0), right col6 (0). No.\n\nRow6, col6: 0. Neighbors: up row5, col6 (0), down none, left col5 (0). No.\n\nSo in the test input, the changes would be:\n\nRow1, col5 \u2192 1\n\nRow2, col1 \u2192 1\n\nRow3, col4 \u2192 1\n\nRow5, col0 \u2192 1\n\nLet's check if there are any other cells.\n\nRow6, any cells? Let's see. For example, row6, col0 is 8, no. Row6, col3 is 0. Adjacent cells: up is row5, col3 (0), left col2 (0), right col4 (0). No.\n\nAnother possible cell: row4, col4 is 8. So no change.\n\nWait, what about row3, col4. It's 0 in the input. Neighbors: left (row3, col3=8), down (row4, col4=8). So two 8s. So becomes 1.\n\nYes, that's already covered.\n\nSo the test output should have:\n\nRow1: [8,8,0,0,0,1,8]\n\nRow2: [8,1,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow3: [0,0,0,8,1,0,0]\n\nRow5: [1,8,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nOther rows remain the same except for these cells.\n\nSo let's construct the output grid:\n\nOriginal test input:\n\nRow0: [0,0,0,0,0,8,8]\n\nRow1: [8,8,0,0,0,0,8]\n\nRow2: [8,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow3: [0,0,0,8,0,0,0]\n\nRow4: [0,0,0,8,8,0,0]\n\nRow5: [0,8,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow6: [8,8,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nAfter applying changes:\n\nRow1: change col5 (0\u21921): [8,8,0,0,0,1,8]\n\nRow2: change col1 (0\u21921): [8,1,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow3: change col4 (0\u21921): [0,0,0,8,1,0,0]\n\nRow5: change col0 (0\u21921): [1,8,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nOther rows remain as in input except these cells.\n\nSo the final output should be:\n\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8]\n\n[8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 1, 8]\n\n[8, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n[0, 0, 0, 8, 1, 0, 0]\n\n[0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0]\n\n[1, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n[8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nLet me check if there are any other cells that I missed.\n\nRow4, col3 is 8. Adjacents: row4, col3 is 8, so no change.\n\nAnother possible candidate: row5, col0 becomes 1. Correct.\n\nWhat about row6, any cells? For example, row6, col0 is 8, so no.\n\nAnother check: row4, col2 is 0. Adjacent cells: up row3, col2 (0), down row5, col2 (0), left col1 (0), right col3 (8). So right is 8. Only one. So no change.\n\nYes, looks like that's all."
