        "cot_1": "Okay, let's see. I need to figure out the pattern between the input and output in the training examples and then apply that to the test input. Let's start by looking at the training examples.\n\nStarting with Example 0. The input is a list of ten rows, all [0,0] except the last one, which is [1,0]. The output has alternating [0,1] and [1,0] except for the last row, which is [1,0]. Wait, the output starts with [0,1], then alternates. The last input row is [1,0], and the output's last row is the same. So maybe the last row stays the same. The other rows are transformed somehow. But how?\n\nLooking at the input rows (excluding the last), they are all zeros. The output rows alternate between [0,1] and [1,0]. So maybe for each row except the last, there's an alternating pattern. The length here is 2 elements. The output alternates starting with [0,1] in the first row. So for a 2-element list, the transformation alternates the positions, starting with flipping the first to [0,1], then [1,0], etc., but only for the rows before the last. But how does that relate to the input? Because all input rows except the last are zeros, maybe the position of the 1 in the last row's input determines something.\n\nWait, in Example 0, the last input row is [1,0], and the output's last row is the same. Then the other output rows are alternating. So maybe the pattern is that for each row except the last, we create a pattern that cycles through shifting a 1 in different positions, perhaps based on the position of the 1 in the last input row.\n\nLooking at Example 1. The input has 3 elements per row. All rows except last are zeros. The last input row is [1,0,0]. The output rows start with [0,1,0], then [1,0,0], then [0,1,0], then [0,0,1], etc. So the output seems to be cycling through different positions where a 1 is moving. Let's list the output rows:\n\nRow 0: [0,1,0]\nRow 1: [1,0,0]\nRow 2: [0,1,0]\nRow 3: [0,0,1]\nRow 4: [0,1,0]\nRow 5: [1,0,0]\nRow 6: [0,1,0]\nRow 7: [0,0,1]\nRow 8: [0,1,0]\nRow 9: [1,0,0]\n\nSo the pattern here seems to be a cycle where the 1 moves in a certain way. For a 3-element row, the positions are 0,1,2. The first output row (0) has 1 at position 1. Then row 1 has it at 0. Row 2 back to 1. Row 3 moves to 2. Then row 4 back to 1, row 5 to 0, row 6 to 1, row7 to 2, etc. So the movement is 1 -> 0 ->1 ->2 ->1 ->0 ->1 ->2 ->1 ->0. Hmm, perhaps it's oscillating around the middle? For 3 elements, the middle is index 1. So maybe the pattern is moving the 1 from the middle to the left, then back to middle, then to the right, then back, etc. Like a pendulum swinging between left, middle, right, middle, left, etc. But the pattern here seems to be 1,0,1,2,1,0,1,2,1,0. So for each even-numbered row (0-based?), it's moving to the next position in a cycle.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output rows are following a certain sequence based on their index. Let's see:\n\nIn Example 1's output, rows 0-9:\n\nRow 0: [0,1,0] (middle)\nRow 1: [1,0,0] (left)\nRow 2: [0,1,0] (middle)\nRow3: [0,0,1] (right)\nRow4: [0,1,0] (middle)\nRow5: [1,0,0] (left)\nRow6: middle\nRow7: right\nRow8: middle\nRow9: left.\n\nSo it's left, middle, right, middle, left, middle, right, etc. But how? The sequence seems to be left (row1), middle (row0?), wait no. Wait, the order is: middle (row0), left (row1), middle (row2), right (row3), middle (row4), left (row5), middle (row6), right (row7), middle (row8), left (row9). So the pattern is middle, left, middle, right, middle, left, middle, right, etc. So every two steps, it alternates between left and right after middle.\n\nIn this case, maybe the pattern is for each row except the last, the output alternates between moving the 1 to the left, middle, right positions in a certain order based on the original 1's position in the last input row. Since in Example1, the last input row is [1,0,0], which is position 0. Then the output rows are moving the 1 in a way that cycles through positions around the original position. But how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is to generate a wave-like pattern where the 1 moves left to right and back, starting from the position of the last input's 1. Wait, in Example0, the last input is [1,0], so position 0. The output rows alternate between [0,1] (position1) and [1,0] (position0). So starting from position0 (last input's 1's position), the output alternates between the other position (1) and the original. So for each row before the last, the output alternates between the original position and the adjacent one.\n\nIn Example0, the last input's 1 is at index0. The output rows (excluding the last) alternate between index1 and index0. So maybe for even-numbered rows (if we count starting from 0), they have the opposite position. Wait, the output for Example0 is:\n\nRow0: [0,1]\nRow1: [1,0]\nRow2: [0,1]\nRow3: [1,0]\n... up to row8: [0,1], then row9 (same as input) [1,0].\n\nSo rows 0,2,4,6,8 have [0,1], rows 1,3,5,7,9 have [1,0]. But the input for all except last row is [0,0], so how is this generated? It's like for each row except last, the output alternates between setting 1 in the other position. For a 2-element row, each row before last alternates between the two positions. So row0 (even index) is the opposite of the last row's 1's position. Then row1 is same as last row's, row2 opposite, etc. But how?\n\nIn Example0, the last input row is [1,0]. So the output for other rows alternates between [0,1] and [1,0], starting with [0,1]. So perhaps the rows are toggling between the two positions, starting with the opposite of the last row's 1. Then alternating. For example, the first row (row0) is opposite (1 in position1), row1 is same as last (position0), row2 opposite, etc.\n\nIn Example1, the last input row is [1,0,0], which is position0. The output rows for the other rows have the 1 moving in a pattern. For example, row0: position1, row1: position0, row2: position1, row3: position2, row4: position1, row5: position0, etc. So it's moving like a pendulum between left, middle, right, middle, left, etc. Starting from the middle (position1) in row0, then left (position0) in row1, middle in row2, right in row3, middle in row4, left in row5, etc. But how does that relate to the last input row's position (which was 0 here)?\n\nWait, perhaps the initial position for the output rows is the middle of the array. For example, in a 3-element array, the middle is index1. Then the movement starts from there, moving left, then back to middle, then right, then back, etc. But how does the last input row's position (0) affect this?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the position of the 1 in the last input row is used as a starting point, and the outputs are generated by moving the 1 in a certain pattern relative to that.\n\nIn Example0, last input is position0. The output for other rows alternates between position1 and position0, starting with position1.\n\nIn Example1, last input is position0. The output starts at position1, moves to 0, 1, 2, 1, 0, 1, 2, 1, 0. So maybe the pattern is starting at middle (position1), then moving left to 0, then back to middle, then right to 2, then middle, etc. So the initial direction is left, then right, left, right, etc. But why? Because the last input's 1 is at position0. Maybe the pattern is to generate a wave that starts from the middle and moves outward, but the initial direction depends on the position of the last input's 1?\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's a cyclic shift. For example, in the 3-element case, the 1 moves in the order: 1, 0, 1, 2, 1, 0, 1, 2, 1, 0. So the pattern is 0,1,2,1,0,1,2,1,0 for the positions. Wait, but how is this generated?\n\nAnother approach: look at the number of rows. In each example, there are 10 rows. The output for the first 9 rows is transformed, and the last row is the same as the input. So the transformation applies to all rows except the last one.\n\nNow, let's look at Example2. The input has 4 elements per row, all zeros except the last row [1,0,0,0]. The output's rows are:\n\nRow0: [0,0,0,1] (position3)\nRow1: [0,0,1,0] (position2)\nRow2: [0,1,0,0] (position1)\nRow3: [1,0,0,0] (position0)\nRow4: [0,1,0,0] (position1)\nRow5: [0,0,1,0] (position2)\nRow6: [0,0,0,1] (position3)\nRow7: [0,0,1,0] (position2)\nRow8: [0,1,0,0] (position1)\nRow9: [1,0,0,0] (position0)\n\nSo the pattern here for a 4-element array is that the 1 moves from the end (position3) to the start (position0) in rows 0 to 3, then back to position1 in row4, position2 in row5, position3 in row6, then back to 2,1,0 in rows7,8,9.\n\nWait, that's a bit confusing. Let's list the positions:\n\nRow0:3\n\nRow1:2\n\nRow2:1\n\nRow3:0\n\nRow4:1\n\nRow5:2\n\nRow6:3\n\nRow7:2\n\nRow8:1\n\nRow9:0\n\nSo the movement is 3\u21922\u21921\u21920\u21921\u21922\u21923\u21922\u21921\u21920. So for the first four rows, the 1 moves from the end to the start. Then in rows 4-6, it moves back to the end, then again from 2\u21921\u21920. But how does this relate to the input's last row's 1 at position0.\n\nWait, the last input row is [1,0,0,0] (position0). The output for other rows starts at position3 and moves left to 0, then right to 3, then left again. Hmm, maybe the pattern is that for even-length arrays, the 1 moves from the end to the start, then back, etc. But in the 4-element case, the first four steps go from 3\u21920, then the next three steps go back up to 3, then down again. But it's not symmetric. Let's see the indices:\n\nThe output sequence for positions in Example2's output is:\n\n3,2,1,0,1,2,3,2,1,0.\n\nThis looks like a wave that starts at the end, moves to the start, then moves back to the end, and then again to the start. But the last row (row9) is the same as the input's last row (position0). So row9 is [1,0,0,0], same as input. So for the test input, which is a 5-element array, all zeros except the last row [1,0,0,0,0].\n\nSo perhaps the pattern is that for each row except the last, the position of the 1 is determined by a certain movement starting from the opposite end of the last input's 1's position and moving towards it, then bouncing back, etc.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the movement is based on the index of the row. For example, in the 2-element case (Example0), the output alternates between positions 1 and 0. For row0, position1; row1, position0; row2, position1, etc.\n\nIn the 3-element case (Example1), the positions follow 1,0,1,2,1,0,1,2,1,0.\n\nIn the 4-element case (Example2), the positions are 3,2,1,0,1,2,3,2,1,0.\n\nSo for each case, the positions seem to form a pattern that starts at the end (for even length?) or the middle (for odd length?), then moves towards the start, then back towards the end, etc., perhaps in a snake-like pattern.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nFor 2 elements (length 2):\n\nPositions in output are [1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0]. So for each row i (0-9), position is 1 - (i%2). So even rows (0,2,4,6,8) are 1, odd rows (1,3,5,7,9) are 0.\n\nFor 3 elements (length3):\n\nThe positions are 1,0,1,2,1,0,1,2,1,0. So the pattern for each row i:\n\ni=0:1\n\ni=1:0\n\ni=2:1\n\ni=3:2\n\ni=4:1\n\ni=5:0\n\ni=6:1\n\ni=7:2\n\ni=8:1\n\ni=9:0\n\nSo the pattern here is for i mod 4:\n\n0 \u21921, 1\u21920, 2\u21921, 3\u21922, then repeats.\n\nWait, maybe not. Let's see:\n\n0 \u21921\n\n1\u21920\n\n2\u21921\n\n3\u21922\n\n4\u21921\n\n5\u21920\n\n6\u21921\n\n7\u21922\n\n8\u21921\n\n9\u21920.\n\nSo the cycle is 0-3: 1,0,1,2. Then 4-7:1,0,1,2. Then 8-9:1,0. So the cycle length is 4 steps. But not sure.\n\nFor 4 elements (Example2):\n\nPositions are 3,2,1,0,1,2,3,2,1,0.\n\nThe pattern here seems to be moving from 3 down to 0, then up to 3, then down to 0 again. But the full cycle would be down (3\u21920), up (0\u21923), down (3\u21920). But here, after 3 steps (rows0-3:3\u21920), then rows4-6:1\u21922\u21923, then rows7-9:2\u21921\u21920. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern for each row i is the absolute value of a wave function. For example, for length n, the position is (i) mod (2*(n-1))), then mirrored. For example, for n=4, the maximum index is3. 2*(4-1) =6. So the positions could be calculated as i mod6, then for i mod6 >=3, it's 6 - (i mod6). So for i=0:0\u21923, i=1:1\u21922, i=2:2\u21921, i=3:3\u21920, i=4:4\u21922 (since 4 mod6 is4, which is >=3 \u21926-4=2?), but in the example for row0 (i=0) the position is3. Hmm, maybe it's a different formula.\n\nAlternatively, for each row index i, the position is calculated based on some function that creates a wave-like pattern.\n\nBut perhaps there's a simpler way. Looking at all examples:\n\nThe output for the first 9 rows (since the last is same as input) seems to generate a sequence where the 1 moves in a pattern that covers the positions in a certain order. For even-length arrays, it's moving back and forth from the end to the start, perhaps. For odd-length arrays, it's moving from middle to left to middle to right, etc.\n\nAnother observation: The initial position of the 1 in the output's first row (row0) seems to be the position opposite to the last input's 1. For example:\n\nIn Example0, last input's 1 is at position0 (of 2 elements). The first output row is [0,1], position1. Which is the opposite end.\n\nIn Example1, last input's 1 is at position0 (3 elements). The first output row is [0,1,0], position1 (middle). For 3 elements, the opposite would be the middle.\n\nIn Example2, last input's 1 is at position0 (4 elements). The first output row is [0,0,0,1], position3 (opposite end).\n\nSo for each case, the first output row has the 1 at the position that is the furthest from the last input's 1's position. For even-length arrays, the opposite end is the last index. For odd-length arrays, the middle is the furthest from the start.\n\nThen, the subsequent rows' 1s move in a certain pattern towards the last input's 1's position and then bounce back.\n\nFor example, in Example0 (2 elements):\n\nStart at position1 (opposite of input's 0), then alternate between 1 and 0 each row.\n\nIn Example1 (3 elements):\n\nStart at middle (1), move to left (0), then back to middle (1), then to right (2), then back to middle (1), left (0), etc.\n\nIn Example2 (4 elements):\n\nStart at position3 (opposite end of input's 0), move left to 2,1,0, then back to 1,2,3, then left to 2,1,0.\n\nSo the pattern seems to be:\n\nFor each row except the last, the 1 moves in a wave-like pattern starting from the opposite end (or middle for odd lengths) of the last input's 1's position. Then, it moves towards the input's position, then back, etc.\n\nSo for the test input, which is 5 elements (length5), last row is [1,0,0,0,0], position0.\n\nThe opposite end or middle for length5 is position4 (since it's 0-based), but wait, the middle of 5 is index2. Wait, for the last input's 1 at position0 in a 5-element array, the opposite would be position4 (the end), but perhaps the starting point is the middle (index2), then moves towards left, then right, etc.\n\nBut let's think about the patterns.\n\nIn Example1 (3 elements), the starting point was the middle (1), then moves left (0), then back to middle (1), then right (2), then back, etc.\n\nFor the test case with 5 elements:\n\nThe last input's 1 is at position0. So the opposite would be the middle of the array (index2), perhaps. Then, the movement would start at index2, then move left (1), then left again (0), then back to 1, then 2, then right (3), then 4, then back to 3, 2, etc. But how does this fit into the 9 rows (rows0-8)?\n\nAlternatively, maybe for 5 elements, the pattern starts at the middle (index2), then moves left to index1, then left to 0, then right to 1, middle (2), right to 3, right to4, then left to3, then 2, etc. But how does that sequence look for 9 rows?\n\nAlternatively, let's consider the pattern from previous examples:\n\nFor 2 elements: positions alternate between 1 and0.\n\nFor3 elements: 1,0,1,2,1,0,1,2,1,0.\n\nFor4 elements: 3,2,1,0,1,2,3,2,1,0.\n\nSo for each length n, the pattern starts at position (n-1) - last_input_pos. For example:\n\nIn Example0: last_input_pos=0, n=2. So (2-1)-0=1. So start at1, then alternate.\n\nIn Example1: n=3, last_input_pos=0. (3-1)-0=2? But no, the starting position was1. Hmm, that doesn't fit. Alternatively, perhaps the starting position is the furthest from the last input's 1's position.\n\nIn Example0, the furthest from0 is1.\n\nIn Example1, the furthest from0 in a3-element array is2. But the first output row's position is1 (middle). So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, for odd lengths, the starting position is the middle. For even lengths, the starting position is the opposite end.\n\nSo for 5 elements (test case), the starting position is the middle (index2), then moves left, then right, etc.\n\nLet's see how that would look.\n\nTest case: last input is [1,0,0,0,0] at position0. So for the output rows (rows0-8), the 1 should start at index2, then move to 1, then0, then back to1, then2, then3, then4, then3, then2.\n\nBut how many rows do we have? The test input has 10 rows (including the last), so the first9 rows (0-8) need to be transformed. Let's list the positions for each row:\n\nAssuming the pattern is: row0\u21922, row1\u21921, row2\u21920, row3\u21921, row4\u21922, row5\u21923, row6\u21924, row7\u21923, row8\u21922.\n\nSo for each of these rows:\n\nRow0: [0,0,1,0,0] \u2192 position2.\n\nRow1: [0,1,0,0,0] \u2192 position1.\n\nRow2: [1,0,0,0,0] \u2192 position0.\n\nRow3: [0,1,0,0,0] \u2192 position1.\n\nRow4: [0,0,1,0,0] \u2192 position2.\n\nRow5: [0,0,0,1,0] \u2192 position3.\n\nRow6: [0,0,0,0,1] \u2192 position4.\n\nRow7: [0,0,0,1,0] \u2192 position3.\n\nRow8: [0,0,1,0,0] \u2192 position2.\n\nThen, row9 (the last one) remains [1,0,0,0,0].\n\nIf this is the case, then the output for the test input would be:\n\n[0,0,1,0,0]\n\n[0,1,0,0,0]\n\n[1,0,0,0,0]\n\n[0,1,0,0,0]\n\n[0,0,1,0,0]\n\n[0,0,0,1,0]\n\n[0,0,0,0,1]\n\n[0,0,0,1,0]\n\n[0,0,1,0,0]\n\n[1,0,0,0,0]\n\nLet's compare this pattern with previous examples.\n\nIn Example1 (3 elements):\n\nThe starting position is1, then moves to0, then1, then2, then1, then0, etc. So the same pattern as above.\n\nIn Example2 (4 elements), the starting position is3 (opposite end of last input's 0), then moves left to2,1,0, then right to1,2,3, then left again.\n\nSo applying the same logic to 5 elements, starting at the middle (index2), then moving left to1,0, then back to1,2, then right to3,4, then back to3,2.\n\nBut why does Example2 start at3 (opposite end) and not the middle? Because in Example2, the array length is even (4 elements), so the middle is between indexes1 and2. So perhaps for even lengths, the starting position is the opposite end (n-1), and for odd lengths, it's the middle ( (n-1)/2 ).\n\nYes, this makes sense. For even length n, starting position is n-1 (last index), and for odd length, starting position is (n-1)/2 (middle).\n\nSo for test case (n=5, odd), starting position is 2.\n\nThen the pattern is:\n\nRow0:2\n\nRow1:1\n\nRow2:0\n\nRow3:1\n\nRow4:2\n\nRow5:3\n\nRow6:4\n\nRow7:3\n\nRow8:2\n\nRow9:0 (same as input)\n\nThis matches the pattern we saw in Example1 and Example0.\n\nSo the output rows would be:\n\nRow0: [0,0,1,0,0]\n\nRow1: [0,1,0,0,0]\n\nRow2: [1,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow3: [0,1,0,0,0]\n\nRow4: [0,0,1,0,0]\n\nRow5: [0,0,0,1,0]\n\nRow6: [0,0,0,0,1]\n\nRow7: [0,0,0,1,0]\n\nRow8: [0,0,1,0,0]\n\nRow9: [1,0,0,0,0]\n\nThis seems to fit the pattern observed in the training examples.",

        "cot_2": "Okay, let's tackle this puzzle. So, I have these training examples and need to find the pattern that transforms the input to the output. Then apply that to the test input. Let me start by looking at each example carefully.\n\nStarting with Example 0. The input is a list of 10 rows, all [0,0] except the last one which is [1,0]. The output seems to alternate between [0,1] and [1,0], starting with [0,1] for the first row. Wait, the output has the same number of rows as the input. So each row in the input is transformed. But how?\n\nLooking at the input, the first 9 rows are all zeros, and the last has a 1. The output alternates between flipping the zeros. So maybe the pattern is that each row in the output is a shifted version based on some rule. Like, the 1 moves in a certain way. Wait, maybe it's related to the position of the 1 in the input. The input's last row has 1 in the first position. The output rows alternate between having 1 in the second and first positions. For example, row 0 of output is [0,1], row1 [1,0], row2 [0,1], etc. So maybe it's a repeating pattern every two rows. But how does the input affect this?\n\nWait, the input's last row has [1,0], and the output's last row is [1,0]. Maybe the output is generated by some rotation or shifting based on the position of the 1 in the input. Let's check the other examples.\n\nExample 1 has a 3-element array. The input's last row is [1,0,0]. The output starts with [0,1,0], then [1,0,0], [0,1,0], [0,0,1], etc. So here, the 1 is moving positions. Let's see the pattern:\n\nOutput rows for Example 1:\n\n0: [0,1,0]\n1: [1,0,0]\n2: [0,1,0]\n3: [0,0,1]\n4: [0,1,0]\n5: [1,0,0]\n6: [0,1,0]\n7: [0,0,1]\n8: [0,1,0]\n9: [1,0,0]\n\nHmm. The movement seems like a cycle. For 3 elements, maybe the 1 is moving in a certain sequence. Let's track the position of 1 in each output row:\n\nRow 0: position 1\nRow1: position 0\nRow2: position1\nRow3: position2\nRow4: position1\nRow5: position0\nRow6: position1\nRow7: position2\nRow8: position1\nRow9: position0\n\nSo the pattern here is 1,0,1,2,1,0,1,2,1,0. It alternates between moving left and right. Like, starting from position1 (row0), then to 0, back to 1, then to 2, back to 1, then 0, etc. So it's like a pendulum swinging between 0 and 2, with the middle position 1 being hit each time. So for a 3-element array, the 1 moves from 1 to 0 to 1 to 2 to 1 to 0, etc. Each step alternates direction.\n\nExample 2 is for 4 elements. Input last row [1,0,0,0]. Output rows:\n\nRow0: [0,0,0,1]\nRow1: [0,0,1,0]\nRow2: [0,1,0,0]\nRow3: [1,0,0,0]\nRow4: [0,1,0,0]\nRow5: [0,0,1,0]\nRow6: [0,0,0,1]\nRow7: [0,0,1,0]\nRow8: [0,1,0,0]\nRow9: [1,0,0,0]\n\nSo the 1 moves from position3 (row0), then 2 (row1), then 1 (row2), then 0 (row3), then back to 1 (row4), 2 (row5), 3 (row6), then 2 (row7), 1 (row8), 0 (row9). Wait, that's a wave pattern: starting at the end (position3), moving left to position0, then right to position3 again, then left again. Like a bouncing between the ends.\n\nWait, let's track the positions:\n\nRow0: 3\nRow1:2\nRow2:1\nRow3:0\nRow4:1\nRow5:2\nRow6:3\nRow7:2\nRow8:1\nRow9:0\n\nSo for 4 elements, it's moving left to 0, then right back to 3, then left again. So the direction changes when it hits the end. Like a snake movement. Each time it reaches an end, it bounces back.\n\nPutting this together, the pattern seems to be that for each row in the output, the position of the 1 is moving in a certain pattern, possibly based on the row index. The input's last row has the initial position (like the starting point), and the rest of the output rows are generated by moving the 1 in a specific sequence.\n\nIn Example 0, 2 elements. The output alternates between positions 1 and 0. For each even row index (0-based?), it's [0,1], and odd is [1,0]. But in the output of example0, the first row (row0) is [0,1], row1 [1,0], row2 [0,1], etc. So alternating every row. But how does that relate to the input's last row being [1,0]?\n\nWait, in the input, all rows except the last are zeros. The output seems to generate a pattern that starts from the position of the 1 in the input's last row and then alternates or shifts based on some rule. For example, in example0, the input's last row is [1,0], which is position0. The output starts with position1 (since row0 is [0,1]), then alternates. But how is that determined?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is a sequence where the 1 moves in a certain direction, and each row in the output is generated by shifting the 1 from the previous position. But the first row of the output would need an initial position. Wait, the input's last row (the 10th row) has the 1 at position0 in example0. The output's last row (row9) is [1,0], same as input's last row. So maybe the output is generated by starting from the input's last row and then creating a sequence moving backward through the rows, shifting the 1 each time according to some pattern.\n\nWait, that's possible. Let me think. For example, in example0:\n\nThe input's 10 rows are all [0,0] except the last which is [1,0]. The output's first row (row0) is [0,1], then row1 [1,0], etc. So perhaps the output is generated by taking the input's last row (position0) and then, for each previous row, shifting the 1 to the next position (alternating between positions 0 and 1). But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output rows are generated by moving the 1 in a pattern that alternates direction each time. For example, in the case of 2 elements, the 1 moves back and forth between positions 0 and 1. But the output alternates each row.\n\nBut the input's last row has [1,0], which is position0. The output starts with [0,1] (position1) for row0, then [1,0] (position0) for row1, etc. So perhaps the direction is inverted. The output is generated from the input's last row, and then each preceding row alternates the position.\n\nBut the input has 10 rows, and the output also has 10 rows. The input's last row is the same as the output's last row. So the output is built from the bottom up. Let me check:\n\nIn example0, input's last row is [1,0], which is the same as output's row9. The output's row8 is [0,1], then row7 is [1,0], etc. So it's like the output is generated by starting from the input's last row and then building upwards with an alternating pattern. For example, row9 is [1,0], row8 [0,1], row7 [1,0], etc. So each row above alternates the position of the 1. So for 2 elements, it's alternating each row. For 3 elements, maybe the pattern is more complex.\n\nIn example1, the input's last row is [1,0,0] (position0). The output's row9 is [1,0,0], same as input. Then row8 is [0,1,0] (position1), row7 [0,0,1] (position2), row6 [0,1,0], row5 [1,0,0], row4 [0,1,0], row3 [0,0,1], row2 [0,1,0], row1 [1,0,0], row0 [0,1,0]. So the movement is: starting from position0, then to position1, position2, back to 1, 0, 1, 2, 1, 0. So it's like moving left to right, but when reaching the end (position0 or position2), it bounces back. Wait, in the output rows, starting from the bottom (row9: position0), then row8: position1, row7: position2, row6: position1, row5: position0, row4: position1, row3: position2, row2: position1, row1: position0, row0: position1. Hmm, that's a bit confusing. Maybe there's a pattern where the direction changes when moving beyond the middle. For 3 elements, the middle is position1. So maybe the movement is like swinging between left and right, moving towards the center each time.\n\nAlternatively, the pattern could be based on the row's index. Let's see: the output rows are 10 in total. For example1, the output starts at row0 with [0,1,0], then row1: [1,0,0], row2: [0,1,0], etc. So for even rows (0,2,4,6,8), it's [0,1,0], and odd rows (1,5,9) are [1,0,0], except for rows3 and7 which are [0,0,1]. Wait, that doesn't fit. So maybe it's a different approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the pattern is a cycle that depends on the number of elements. For example, for 2 elements, the cycle alternates between positions 0 and1. For 3 elements, the cycle is longer. For 4 elements, it's another cycle.\n\nLooking at example2's output for 4 elements:\n\nRow0: [0,0,0,1] (pos3)\nRow1: [0,0,1,0] (pos2)\nRow2: [0,1,0,0] (pos1)\nRow3: [1,0,0,0] (pos0)\nRow4: [0,1,0,0] (pos1)\nRow5: [0,0,1,0] (pos2)\nRow6: [0,0,0,1] (pos3)\nRow7: [0,0,1,0] (pos2)\nRow8: [0,1,0,0] (pos1)\nRow9: [1,0,0,0] (pos0)\n\nSo the 1 moves from pos3 to 2 to 1 to 0 (leftwards), then back to 1, 2, 3, then back to 2,1,0. So the direction changes when reaching the ends. So for 4 elements, it's a snake-like pattern moving left then right then left, etc.\n\nPutting all this together, the pattern seems to be that for each output row, the position of the 1 is determined by a sequence that starts at the position of the input's last row and then moves in a certain direction, changing direction when hitting the ends of the array.\n\nFor the input's last row, which has the 1 in the first position (position0 for 2 elements, position0 for 3 elements, etc.), the output starts from that position and then alternates direction each time it hits an end. \n\nWait, in example0's input, the last row is [1,0] (pos0). The output's last row (row9) is the same, then the previous row (row8) is [0,1] (pos1), then row7 [1,0] (pos0), etc. So the pattern alternates between pos0 and pos1 as we go up the rows. For even-numbered rows (when counting from the bottom?), the position alternates. But how?\n\nAlternatively, the output is generated by moving the 1 in a back-and-forth pattern, starting from the input's initial position. The movement alternates direction each time it reaches the end. For example, for 2 elements, starting at pos0, next is pos1, then pos0, then pos1, etc. But example0's output starts with pos1 in row0. Wait, maybe the output is generated in reverse order. Let me check:\n\nIn example0's output, the last row (row9) is the same as input's last row: [1,0]. Then row8 is [0,1], row7 [1,0], row6 [0,1], etc. So if we list the output rows from bottom to top (row9 to row0), the positions alternate between 0 and1. So row9:0, row8:1, row7:0, row6:1, etc. So the pattern is that each row alternates the position of the 1 compared to the row below it.\n\nBut how does this apply to the other examples? Let's look at example1. The input's last row is [1,0,0] (pos0). The output's row9 is the same. Then row8 is [0,1,0] (pos1), row7 [0,0,1] (pos2), row6 [0,1,0] (pos1), row5 [1,0,0] (pos0), row4 [0,1,0] (pos1), row3 [0,0,1] (pos2), row2 [0,1,0] (pos1), row1 [1,0,0] (pos0), row0 [0,1,0] (pos1). \n\nSo when going from row9 up to row0, the 1 moves from pos0 to pos1 to pos2 to pos1 to pos0 to pos1 to pos2 to pos1 to pos0 to pos1. So the movement is like expanding and contracting. For 3 elements, the direction alternates when reaching pos0 or pos2 (the ends). So starting at pos0 (row9), next row up (row8) is pos1, then row7 pos2 (end of the array), so next direction changes to left. Then row6 pos1, row5 pos0 (another end), direction changes again to right. Then row4 pos1, row3 pos2 (end), direction left. row2 pos1, row1 pos0 (end), direction right. row0 pos1. \n\nThis creates a pattern where the 1 moves towards the right until it hits the end (pos2), then left until it hits pos0, and so on. So for an array of length n, the movement is bouncing between the ends, changing direction each time an end is hit.\n\nSimilarly, in example2 (4 elements), the movement starts at pos0 (row9's input is [1,0,0,0]?), wait no. Wait example2's input last row is [1,0,0,0], which is pos0. The output's row9 is [1,0,0,0]. Then row8 is [0,1,0,0] (pos1), row7 [0,0,1,0] (pos2), row6 [0,0,0,1] (pos3), then direction changes left. row5 [0,0,1,0] (pos2), row4 [0,1,0,0] (pos1), row3 [1,0,0,0] (pos0), direction changes right. row2 [0,1,0,0] (pos1), row1 [0,0,1,0] (pos2), row0 [0,0,0,1] (pos3). \n\nWait, but looking at the output rows as listed in example2:\n\nRow0: [0,0,0,1] (pos3)\nRow1: [0,0,1,0] (pos2)\nRow2: [0,1,0,0] (pos1)\nRow3: [1,0,0,0] (pos0)\nRow4: [0,1,0,0] (pos1)\nRow5: [0,0,1,0] (pos2)\nRow6: [0,0,0,1] (pos3)\nRow7: [0,0,1,0] (pos2)\nRow8: [0,1,0,0] (pos1)\nRow9: [1,0,0,0] (pos0)\n\nSo if we look from row0 to row9, the 1 moves from pos3 to pos2 to pos1 to pos0 (leftwards), then to pos1, pos2, pos3 (rightwards), then pos2, pos1, pos0 again. But this seems like a bouncing pattern between the ends. For 4 elements, starting at pos3 (row0), moving left to pos0 (row3), then right to pos3 (row6), then left again to pos0 (row9). So the pattern is a left-right-left movement, each time going the full length of the array. Each time it hits an end, it reverses direction.\n\nWait, but how does this apply to the test input? The test input is a 5-element array with the last row [1,0,0,0,0], pos0. The output should follow a similar bouncing pattern.\n\nSo for 5 elements, starting from pos0 (the input's last row), moving right until it hits the end (pos4), then left, then right, etc. But how does this translate to the output rows?\n\nWait, perhaps each output row is generated by moving the 1 in a direction (left or right) based on the previous position and the boundaries. For example, starting at pos0, next move right to pos1, then pos2, then pos3, pos4, then bounce left to pos3, pos2, pos1, pos0, and so on. But this depends on the number of elements and the direction changes.\n\nWait, in example1 (3 elements), the movement after pos0 was to pos1, then pos2 (right end), then back to pos1, then pos0 (left end), then pos1, pos2, etc. So for odd lengths, the direction changes after hitting the end. For even lengths (like example2's 4 elements), it moves all the way left then right, etc.\n\nSo for the test case with 5 elements (length 5), starting at pos0, the movement would be:\n\npos0 \u2192 pos1 \u2192 pos2 \u2192 pos3 \u2192 pos4 (hit end, change direction to left)\npos3 \u2192 pos2 \u2192 pos1 \u2192 pos0 (hit end, change direction to right)\npos1 \u2192 pos2 \u2192 pos3 \u2192 pos4 (again, hit end, change direction)\n\nBut let's check how many rows we need. The test input has 10 rows. So the output would have 10 rows, each with the 1 moving in this pattern.\n\nBut how do the rows relate to each other? Let's think: the input's last row (row9 in the input) is [1,0,0,0,0]. The output's row9 should be the same. Then, each previous row (row8, row7, etc.) would have the 1 moving according to the pattern.\n\nSo starting from row9 (pos0), the next row up (row8) would move right to pos1. Row7: pos2. Row6: pos3. Row5: pos4 (end of array, direction changes to left). Row4: pos3. Row3: pos2. Row2: pos1. Row1: pos0 (end, direction changes to right). Row0: pos1.\n\nWait, but there are 10 rows. Let's list the positions:\n\nRow9 (output last row): pos0\nRow8: pos1\nRow7: pos2\nRow6: pos3\nRow5: pos4\nRow4: pos3 (direction changed after pos4)\nRow3: pos2\nRow2: pos1\nRow1: pos0 (direction changes again)\nRow0: pos1\n\nBut wait, that's 10 rows. Let's count:\n\nRow9:0\n\nRow8:1\n\nRow7:2\n\nRow6:3\n\nRow5:4\n\nRow4:3\n\nRow3:2\n\nRow2:1\n\nRow1:0\n\nRow0:1\n\nSo the positions would be [0,1,2,3,4,3,2,1,0,1] for rows9 down to row0.\n\nBut the output is written from row0 to row9. So the output rows are ordered from row0 to row9, which corresponds to the input's rows. So the input's row0 is transformed to output row0. But how does the input's structure affect the output?\n\nWait, the input's rows are all zeros except the last one. The output's rows are generated in a way that starts from the input's last row's 1 position and then moves in a pattern upwards. So the output row0 is the first transformed row, but how is it connected to the input's row0?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by applying a certain transformation to each input row, but the input rows are all zeros except the last. So the transformation isn't based on the input rows, but perhaps the pattern is derived from the position of the 1 in the last row and the row index.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is a sequence of rows where the 1 moves in a pattern determined by the row index. For example, for each row i in the output, the position of the 1 is determined by a certain formula involving i and the array length.\n\nIn example0 (2 elements), the positions in the output rows (row0 to row9) are: 1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0. Which is alternating between 1 and 0 for each row. So for even i (0,2,4,6,8), the position is 1, and odd i (1,3,5,7,9) it's 0. But how does this relate to the input's last row being position0? Maybe the output starts with position1 and alternates each row.\n\nBut in example1 (3 elements), the output row0 is [0,1,0] (pos1), row1 [1,0,0] (pos0), row2 [0,1,0] (pos1), row3 [0,0,1] (pos2), row4 [0,1,0] (pos1), etc. So the pattern here isn't a simple alternating based on row parity. So perhaps it's more complex.\n\nAnother approach: the output for each row i is determined by the position (i) modulo some cycle length. For example, in example0 (2 elements), the cycle length is 2. So for each row, position = i % 2, but for even i, position is 1, and for odd, 0. But how?\n\nAlternatively, the cycle length is 2*(n-1), where n is the number of elements. For 2 elements, cycle length is 2*(2-1)=2. So each row's position is determined by i mod 2. For example0, the positions would be 1,0,1,0,...\n\nFor 3 elements, cycle length is 2*(3-1)=4. So positions repeat every 4 rows. Let's check example1:\n\nRow0:1\nRow1:0\nRow2:1\nRow3:2\nRow4:1\nRow5:0\nRow6:1\nRow7:2\nRow8:1\nRow9:0\n\nThe pattern here is 1,0,1,2,1,0,1,2,1,0. So the cycle is 1,0,1,2, which is a cycle of 4. Which matches 2*(3-1)=4. So each cycle is 4 steps.\n\nSimilarly, for 4 elements, cycle length would be 2*(4-1)=6. Let's check example2's positions:\n\nRow0:3\nRow1:2\nRow2:1\nRow3:0\nRow4:1\nRow5:2\nRow6:3\nRow7:2\nRow8:1\nRow9:0\n\nThe cycle here is 3,2,1,0,1,2. That's 6 steps (positions 3,2,1,0,1,2), then repeats. So the cycle length is 6, which is 2*(4-1) =6. That fits.\n\nSo the general formula seems to be that for an array of length n, the cycle length is 2*(n-1). Then, for each row i in the output, the position of the 1 is determined by (i) modulo (2*(n-1)), and within that cycle, the position is calculated as follows:\n\nFor the first (n-1) steps, the position decreases from (n-1) to 0, then increases back to (n-1) in the next (n-1) steps. So the pattern is a sawtooth wave that goes down and then up.\n\nWait, for example0 (n=2), cycle length 2. So positions would be:\n\ni mod 2:\n\n0 mod2=0 \u2192 position (1 - 0) =1?\n\n1 mod2=1 \u2192 position (0) ?\n\nWait, maybe the formula is: position = (cycle_length - (i % cycle_length)) if (i % cycle_length) < cycle_length/2 else (i % cycle_length - (cycle_length/2)) \n\nNot sure. Alternatively, for each i, the position is calculated as follows:\n\nFor n elements:\n\ncycle_length = 2*(n-1)\n\nindex_in_cycle = i % cycle_length\n\nif index_in_cycle < n-1:\n    position = (n-1) - index_in_cycle\nelse:\n    position = index_in_cycle - (n-1)\n\nBut let's test this for example0 (n=2):\n\ncycle_length=2*(2-1)=2\n\nfor i=0:\n\nindex_in_cycle=0 \u2192 0 <1 \u2192 position=1-0=1 \u2192 correct.\n\ni=1: index_in_cycle=1 \u2192 which is >=1 (n-1=1). position=1-1=0 \u2192 correct.\n\nFor example1 (n=3):\n\ncycle_length=4\n\nfor i=0:\n\nindex_in_cycle=0 <2 \u2192 position=2-0=2. But the actual position in row0 is1. Hmm, doesn't match.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing an offset. Maybe the formula is:\n\nposition = (n-1 - index_in_cycle) if index_in_cycle < (n-1) else (index_in_cycle - (n-1))\n\nBut for example1's row0:\n\nn=3, cycle_length=4.\n\ni=0 \u2192 index_in_cycle=0 <2 \u2192 position=2-0=2. But in example1's row0, the position is1. So this doesn't match.\n\nHmm. Maybe the formula is different. Let's look at the positions for example1 (n=3):\n\nRow0:1 \u2192 i=0 \u2192 index_in_cycle=0 \u2192 ?\n\nRow1:0 \u2192i=1 \u2192 index_in_cycle=1 \u2192 ?\n\nRow2:1 \u2192i=2 \u2192 index_in_cycle=2 \u2192 ?\n\nRow3:2 \u2192i=3 \u2192 index_in_cycle=3 \u2192 ?\n\nRow4:1 \u2192i=4 \u2192 index_in_cycle=0 \u2192 ?\n\nWait, the cycle is 4 steps. So for i=0, index_in_cycle=0. i=1\u21921, i=2\u21922, i=3\u21923, i=4\u21920, etc.\n\nIf the positions are 1,0,1,2 for the cycle, then for index_in_cycle:\n\n0 \u21921\n\n1 \u21920\n\n2\u21921\n\n3\u21922\n\nThen for the next cycle (i=4, index_in_cycle=0\u21921, etc.\n\nBut how to derive this from a formula.\n\nAnother approach: the positions in the cycle are moving from (n-2) down to 0, then up to (n-2). Wait, for n=3:\n\nThe positions in example1's cycle are1,0,1,2.\n\nHmm, this is confusing. Let's think differently. For n elements, the pattern seems to be that the 1 moves back and forth between the first and last element, but for even and odd lengths, the behavior differs.\n\nAlternatively, the position for row i is determined by:\n\nposition = | (i mod (2*(n-1))) - (n-1) + 1 | \n\nWait, not sure. Let's try for example0 (n=2):\n\nFor i=0: |0 mod 2 -1 +1| = |0-1+1|=0 \u2192 but position is1.\n\nHmm, not correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the position is (n-1) - (i % (n-1)) when moving left, then (i % (n-1)) when moving right.\n\nWait, for example2 (n=4):\n\ncycle_length=2*(4-1)=6.\n\nFor index_in_cycle 0: (4-1) -0 =3 \u2192 row0's position is3.\n\nindex_in_cycle1:3-1=2 \u2192 row1's position2.\n\nindex_in_cycle2:3-2=1 \u2192 row2's position1.\n\nindex_in_cycle3:3-3=0 \u2192 row3's position0.\n\nindex_in_cycle4: 4-3=1 \u2192 1 \u2192 row4's position1?\n\nWait, example2's row4 is [0,1,0,0], position1. Yes.\n\nindex_in_cycle5:5-3=2 \u2192 row5's position2.\n\nThen index_in_cycle0 again:3 \u2192 row6's position3.\n\nSo this seems to fit. The formula for the position is:\n\nIf the index_in_cycle is less than (n-1), position = (n-1) - index_in_cycle.\n\nOtherwise, position = index_in_cycle - (n-1) +1 ?\n\nWait, example2's cycle is 6 steps. For index_in_cycle 0-3 (0 to3):\n\npositions 3,2,1,0. Then for index_in_cycle4-5 (4-5):\n\npositions1,2.\n\nSo for index_in_cycle >= (n-1) (4-1=3), position is (index_in_cycle - (n-1)) \u2192 for index 4:4-3=1. index5:5-3=2.\n\nYes, that fits. So the formula is:\n\ncycle_length = 2*(n-1)\n\nindex_in_cycle = i % cycle_length\n\nif index_in_cycle < (n-1):\n\n    position = (n-1) - index_in_cycle\n\nelse:\n\n    position = index_in_cycle - (n-1)\n\nBut let's test this.\n\nFor example0 (n=2):\n\ncycle_length=2.\n\nindex_in_cycle for i=0 \u21920 <1: position=1-0=1.\n\ni=1 \u21921 >=1 \u2192 position=1-1=0.\n\nWhich matches example0's output.\n\nExample1 (n=3):\n\ncycle_length=4.\n\ni=0: index_in_cycle0 <2 \u2192 position=2-0=2. But in example1's row0, the position is1. So discrepancy.\n\nWait, this suggests the formula is incorrect. Hmm.\n\nWait in example1's row0, the position is1, but according to the formula, it's2. So perhaps the formula needs adjustment.\n\nMaybe the formula should use (n-2) instead of (n-1). Let's try:\n\nposition = (n-2) - index_in_cycle if index_in_cycle < (n-1), else index_in_cycle - (n-2).\n\nFor example1 (n=3):\n\nn-2=1.\n\nFor index_in_cycle0:1-0=1 \u2192 correct.\n\nindex_in_cycle1:1-1=0 \u2192 correct.\n\nindex_in_cycle2: since 2 <2 is false (n-1=2), so position=2-1=1.\n\nindex_in_cycle3:3-1=2 \u2192 correct.\n\nYes, this would give for example1:\n\ni=0: index_in_cycle0 \u21921-0=1 \u2192 pos1.\n\ni=1: index_in_cycle1 \u21921-1=0 \u2192 pos0.\n\ni=2: index_in_cycle2 \u2192 since 2 >=2, position=2-1=1.\n\ni=3: index_in_cycle3 \u21923-1=2 \u2192 pos2.\n\ni=4: index_in_cycle0 \u21921-0=1.\n\nWhich matches example1's output rows.\n\nFor example2 (n=4):\n\nn-2=2.\n\ncycle_length=2*(4-1)=6.\n\nFor index_in_cycle0:2-0=2 \u2192 but example2's row0 is pos3. So no, this doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. Maybe the formula is different. Let's think again.\n\nLooking at example1's positions:\n\nThe cycle is 1,0,1,2. For n=3, the positions start at1, go to0 (left end), then back to1, then to2 (right end), and repeat. So the movement is between the left end (0), middle (1), and right end (2).\n\nPerhaps the formula for position is:\n\nFor even cycle steps, move left, then right, etc. But I'm not seeing it.\n\nAlternatively, for each row i, the position is calculated as (i) mod (2*(n-1)) which is then mapped to a position within 0 to n-1.\n\nFor example, in example0 (n=2):\n\n2*(n-1)=2. For i=0 \u21920 mod2=0 \u2192 position1. i=1 \u21921 mod2=1\u21920.\n\nYes.\n\nExample1 (n=3):\n\n2*(3-1)=4. So for i=0 \u21920 mod4=0 \u2192 position1.\n\ni=1 \u21921 mod4=1 \u21920.\n\ni=2 \u21922 mod4=2 \u21921.\n\ni=3 \u21923 mod4=3 \u21922.\n\ni=4 \u21924 mod4=0 \u21921.\n\ni=5 \u21925 mod4=1 \u21920.\n\ni=6 \u21926 mod4=2 \u21921.\n\ni=7 \u21927 mod4=3 \u21922.\n\ni=8 \u21928 mod4=0 \u21921.\n\ni=9 \u21929 mod4=1 \u21920.\n\nWhich matches example1's output positions: row0-9:1,0,1,2,1,0,1,2,1,0.\n\nSo the mapping from mod result to position is:\n\nmod_result=0 \u21921\n\nmod_result=1 \u21920\n\nmod_result=2 \u21921\n\nmod_result=3 \u21922\n\nSo for mod_result < n-1, the position is (n-2) - mod_result. For mod_result >= n-1, it's mod_result - (n-1) +1.\n\nWait, for n=3:\n\nmod_result=0: (3-2) -0=1 \u2192 yes.\n\nmod_result=1: (3-2)-1=0 \u2192 yes.\n\nmod_result=2: since 2 >=2 (n-1=2), then mod_result - (n-1) +1 \u21922-2+1=1 \u2192 but example1's mod_result=2 corresponds to position1. Yes.\n\nmod_result=3:3-2+1=2 \u2192 yes.\n\nSo the general formula could be:\n\nposition = (n-2) - mod_result, if mod_result < (n-1)\n\nelse, position = mod_result - (n-1) +1\n\nWait, but for n=3, mod_result=2 is not < (n-1=2), so falls into else clause: 2-2+1=1.\n\nYes.\n\nFor example2 (n=4):\n\nmod_result=0: (4-2) -0=2 \u2192 but example2's row0 is pos3.\n\nHmm, this doesn't fit. So the formula works for n=2 and 3 but not for 4.\n\nWait, in example2, n=4. The cycle_length is6 (2*(4-1)).\n\nFor i=0:0 mod6=0 \u2192 position3.\n\ni=1:1 mod6=1 \u2192 position2.\n\ni=2:2 mod6=2 \u2192 position1.\n\ni=3:3 mod6=3 \u2192 position0.\n\ni=4:4 mod6=4 \u2192 position1.\n\ni=5:5 mod6=5 \u2192 position2.\n\ni=6:6 mod6=0 \u2192 position3.\n\nSo the positions are3,2,1,0,1,2 for each cycle.\n\nBut according to the formula:\n\nFor mod_result < (n-1=3):\n\nposition = (n-2) - mod_result \u21924-2=2 \u2192 mod_result <3.\n\nFor mod_result=0:2-0=2 \u2192 but example2's position is3.\n\nNo. So the formula isn't correct for n=4.\n\nHmm. This suggests that the pattern for even and odd n might be different.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the position is (n-1) - mod_result when mod_result < (n-1), and (mod_result - (n-1)) when >=.\n\nFor example2, n=4:\n\nmod_result=0:3-0=3 \u2192 correct (row0's position3).\n\nmod_result=1:3-1=2 \u2192 correct (row1's position2).\n\nmod_result=2:3-2=1 \u2192 correct (row2's position1).\n\nmod_result=3:3-3=0 \u2192 correct (row3's position0).\n\nmod_result=4:4-3=1 \u2192 correct (row4's position1).\n\nmod_result=5:5-3=2 \u2192 correct (row5's position2).\n\nYes! So the correct formula is:\n\ncycle_length = 2*(n-1)\n\nmod_result = i % cycle_length\n\nif mod_result < (n-1):\n\n    position = (n-1) - mod_result\n\nelse:\n\n    position = mod_result - (n-1)\n\nFor example2 (n=4):\n\nmod_result=0 \u21920 <3 \u21923-0=3.\n\nmod_result=1 \u21921 <3 \u21923-1=2.\n\nmod_result=2 \u21922 <3 \u21923-2=1.\n\nmod_result=3 \u21923 <3 is false \u21923-3=0 \u2192 position0.\n\nmod_result=4 \u21924 >=3 \u21924-3=1.\n\nmod_result=5 \u21925-3=2.\n\nThis matches example2's positions.\n\nFor example1 (n=3):\n\nmod_result=0 \u21920 <2 \u21922-0=2. But example1's position is1. Wait, this doesn't fit.\n\nWait, example1's n=3, so cycle_length=4. So for i=0, mod_result=0.\n\nBut according to the formula, position=2-0=2. But example1's row0 has position1. So this is a problem.\n\nAh, there's a mistake here. For n=3, cycle_length=2*(3-1)=4. The formula uses (n-1) which is2. So mod_result <2.\n\nFor mod_result=0: position=2-0=2 \u2192 but in example1's row0, the position is1.\n\nThis suggests that the formula works for even n but not for odd n. So perhaps there's a different approach for odd and even lengths.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the formula should be (n-1) - mod_result when mod_result < (n-1), else mod_result - (n-1). But for n=3, this gives positions2,1,0, etc., which doesn't match example1.\n\nSo perhaps the formula needs to be adjusted by subtracting 1 for odd n.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the initial position is not (n-1) but (n-1 -1) for odd n. This is getting too complicated.\n\nAnother way to think: the pattern for the position is that the 1 moves from the first position (pos0) to the last (posn-1) and back, but this might vary based on the input's last row's position.\n\nBut in all examples, the input's last row has the 1 in pos0. So the output's last row is pos0. The output is generated by moving the 1 from pos0 upwards (row9 to row0), following the bouncing pattern.\n\nSo for each row in the output (starting from row9, which is pos0), the next row up (row8) would be pos1, row7 pos2, etc., until the end is hit, then direction reverses.\n\nFor example, test input has 5 elements (n=5). The output's last row (row9) is [1,0,0,0,0] (pos0). Then row8: pos1, row7:pos2, row6:pos3, row5:pos4 (end of array, direction changes to left), row4:pos3, row3:pos2, row2:pos1, row1:pos0 (end, direction changes to right), row0:pos1.\n\nSo the positions from row9 to row0 would be:\n\n9:0\n\n8:1\n\n7:2\n\n6:3\n\n5:4\n\n4:3\n\n3:2\n\n2:1\n\n1:0\n\n0:1\n\nBut the output is written from row0 to row9. So the positions for row0 to row9 would be:\n\nrow0:1\n\nrow1:0\n\nrow2:1\n\nrow3:2\n\nrow4:3\n\nrow5:4\n\nrow6:3\n\nrow7:2\n\nrow8:1\n\nrow9:0\n\nBut according to the formula, with n=5 and cycle_length=8 (2*(5-1)=8?), wait n=5, cycle_length=2*(5-1)=8.\n\nWait, but with n=5, the cycle_length would be 2*(5-1)=8. So for each row i, mod_result =i%8.\n\nBut the test input requires 10 rows. So:\n\nFor i=0 \u2192 mod_result=0 \u2192 position=4-0=4 (n-1=4). But according to the pattern we thought earlier, row0 should be position1.\n\nHmm, this contradicts. So perhaps the formula is not applicable here. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the formula applies when the input's last row is in pos0, and the output starts from that position, then moves in the pattern. For the test input with n=5 and 10 rows:\n\nThe positions from row9 to row0 are:\n\nrow9:0\n\nrow8:1\n\nrow7:2\n\nrow6:3\n\nrow5:4\n\nrow4:3\n\nrow3:2\n\nrow2:1\n\nrow1:0\n\nrow0:1\n\nSo when written as output from row0 to row9, the positions are:\n\nrow0:1\n\nrow1:0\n\nrow2:1\n\nrow3:2\n\nrow4:3\n\nrow5:4\n\nrow6:3\n\nrow7:2\n\nrow8:1\n\nrow9:0\n\nThus, each row's 1 is moving in a pattern that starts at pos0 (row9), moves right to pos4 (row5), then left to pos0 (row1), then right again to pos1 (row0). But this pattern would generate the positions as listed.\n\nSo for n=5, the output rows would be:\n\nrow0: [0,1,0,0,0]\n\nrow1: [1,0,0,0,0]\n\nrow2: [0,1,0,0,0]\n\nrow3: [0,0,1,0,0]\n\nrow4: [0,0,0,1,0]\n\nrow5: [0,0,0,0,1]\n\nrow6: [0,0,0,1,0]\n\nrow7: [0,0,1,0,0]\n\nrow8: [0,1,0,0,0]\n\nrow9: [1,0,0,0,0]\n\nThis matches the pattern observed in previous examples. For example, in example2 (n=4), the output starts at pos3 and moves left to 0, then right to3, then left again.\n\nSo applying this to the test input (n=5), the output should have the 1 moving right from pos0 to pos4, then left back to pos0, then right again. But since there are 10 rows, the movement would be:\n\nrow0: pos1\n\nrow1: pos0\n\nrow2: pos1\n\nrow3: pos2\n\nrow4: pos3\n\nrow5: pos4\n\nrow6: pos3\n\nrow7: pos2\n\nrow8: pos1\n\nrow9: pos0\n\nEach row's array would have a single 1 at the corresponding position.\n\nSo the final output for the test input would be:\n\n[0,1,0,0,0]\n\n[1,0,0,0,0]\n\n[0,1,0,0,0]\n\n[0,0,1,0,0]\n\n[0,0,0,1,0]\n\n[0,0,0,0,1]\n\n[0,0,0,1,0]\n\n[0,0,1,0,0]\n\n[0,1,0,0,0]\n\n[1,0,0,0,0]\n\nThis matches the expected pattern observed in the training examples."
