        "cot_1": "Okay, let's take a look at these examples. The task is to figure out the pattern that transforms the input into the output. \n\nStarting with Example 0. The input is a 3x3 matrix. The output seems to be each row duplicated. So the first row [0,5,0] becomes [0,5,0,0,5,0], which is the original row followed by itself. The same for the second row [5,5,2] becomes [5,5,2,5,5,2]. The third row is all zeros, and it's duplicated as well. \n\nLooking at Example 1. The input is a 4x3 matrix. The output rows are each row duplicated. For example, the first input row [3,0,0] becomes [3,0,0,3,0,0]. The same pattern holds for all rows. \n\nExample 2 is a 4x4 matrix. The output rows are duplicated again. The first row [5,2,3,0] becomes [5,2,3,0,5,2,3,0], so the length doubles. Each row is repeated once.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me check the outputs again. In Example 2's last row input is [0,0,6,0], and the output is [0,0,6,0,0,0,6,0]. Wait, the duplicated part is [0,0,6,0], but the output has two 0s before 6 and then 0 again. Wait, no, the original row is [0,0,6,0], so when duplicated, it should be [0,0,6,0,0,0,6,0]. Which matches the output. So yes, each row is concatenated with itself.\n\nSo the pattern is: for each row in the input, the output row is the original row followed by a copy of itself. So the output matrix has rows that are twice as long as the input rows. The number of rows remains the same.\n\nSo applying this to the test input. The test input has 5 rows, each of length 4. So each row should be duplicated. Let's take the first test input row: [4,0,0,0]. Following the pattern, it becomes [4,0,0,0,4,0,0,0]. Similarly, the second row [4,5,0,0] becomes [4,5,0,0,4,5,0,0]. The third row [0,5,6,0] duplicates to [0,5,6,0,0,5,6,0]. Fourth row [6,6,1,0] becomes [6,6,1,0,6,6,1,0]. The last row [0,0,0,1] becomes [0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1]. \n\nLet me check if there are any exceptions. All examples so far have the output rows as the input row concatenated with itself. No exceptions in the training examples. So this should be the correct pattern.",

        "cot_2": "Okay, let's tackle this puzzle. So, the task is to figure out the pattern that transforms the input matrices into the output matrices provided in the training examples. Then apply that pattern to the test input.\n\nLooking at the first example:\n\nInput:\n[0,5,0]\n[5,5,2]\n[0,0,0]\n\nOutput:\nEach row is doubled. So the original row is followed by the same elements again. Like [0,5,0,0,5,0]. So the length triples from 3 to 6? Wait, wait. Original row length is 3, output is 6. So each row is duplicated, concatenated to itself. So the output rows are the original row repeated twice. Let's check example 1.\n\nExample 1 input has rows like [3,0,0], and output is [3,0,0,3,0,0]. So same thing. Each row is duplicated. So the pattern is that each row is concatenated with itself. So for example, a row of length N becomes length 2N by repeating the same elements again.\n\nBut wait, let's check the third example. Example 2's input has rows of length 4, and output rows are length 8. So yes, each row is doubled. So that seems consistent. So the pattern is that each row is duplicated, concatenated to itself. That's straightforward.\n\nBut wait, let's check the third row in example 2. Input is [0,0,6,0], output is [0,0,6,0,0,0,6,0]. Wait, if you duplicate the original row, the output would be [0,0,6,0,0,0,6,0]. Wait, the original input row is [0,0,6,0]. If we duplicate that, the output row would be [0,0,6,0,0,0,6,0], but that's not exactly the same. Wait, wait. The original row is [0,0,6,0], so duplicating would make [0,0,6,0,0,0,6,0]. But looking at the output given in example 2 for that row, it's [0,0,6,0,0,0,6,0]. Wait, but that's exactly what duplication would do. So each element is duplicated in the row. Wait, maybe each element is written twice? Like each number is repeated once, so the row becomes twice as long. Wait, let's see.\n\nTake the first example's first row: [0,5,0]. Output is [0,5,0,0,5,0]. Wait, no. If each element is written twice, then it would be [0,0,5,5,0,0], but the output here is [0,5,0,0,5,0]. So that's not the case. Instead, the entire row is appended again. So [0,5,0] becomes [0,5,0] + [0,5,0] = [0,5,0,0,5,0]. Wait, but in that case, the concatenated row is the original followed by the original again. But wait, the first example's output for row 1 is [5,5,2,5,5,2]. So original row is [5,5,2], and the output row is that followed by itself. So yes, the entire row is duplicated and appended. So the pattern is that each row is duplicated: the output row is the input row concatenated with itself. So the length of each row doubles.\n\nBut then why in example 2, the third row input is [5,2,8,8], output is [5,2,8,8,5,2,8,8]. So yes, that's the same as duplicating the row. Similarly, the fourth row input is [0,0,6,0], output is [0,0,6,0,0,0,6,0]. Wait, that's different. Wait, the input is [0,0,6,0]. If we duplicate it, the output should be [0,0,6,0, 0,0,6,0]. But the given output is [0,0,6,0,0,0,6,0]. Wait, the last four elements are 0,0,6,0. Wait, no. Let me check again. Oh wait, the input is [0,0,6,0]. If we append it again, the output would be [0,0,6,0,0,0,6,0]. But that's exactly what is in the example. So the output is the original row concatenated with the same row again. So that's correct.\n\nSo all examples follow that pattern: each row is duplicated. So the output row is the input row concatenated with itself. So the transformation is simply doubling each row's elements by appending the same elements again.\n\nNow, applying this to the test input. The test input has 5 rows. Each row should be duplicated.\n\nTest Input:\n\nRow 1: [4,0,0,0] \u2192 becomes [4,0,0,0,4,0,0,0]\nRow 2: [4,5,0,0] \u2192 becomes [4,5,0,0,4,5,0,0]\nRow 3: [0,5,6,0] \u2192 becomes [0,5,6,0,0,5,6,0]\nRow 4: [6,6,1,0] \u2192 becomes [6,6,1,0,6,6,1,0]\nRow 5: [0,0,0,1] \u2192 becomes [0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1]\n\nSo each row in the output is the input row followed by itself. That's the pattern. Therefore, the final answer should be each row of the test input duplicated in this way."
