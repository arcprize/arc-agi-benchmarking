        "cot_1": "Okay, let's tackle this puzzle. So, the task is to figure out the pattern from the training examples and apply it to the test input. Let's start by analyzing the examples.\n\nLooking at Example 0:\nInput is three rows:\n[5,3,4]\n[3,4,5]\n[3,4,4]\n\nThe output is a 6x6 grid. Wait, actually, the output has six lists. Each list in the output has six elements. Let me check the structure.\n\nThe first output row is [5,3,4,4,3,5]. Hmm, this looks like the original input row [5,3,4] followed by its reverse [4,3,5] but wait, the reverse of [5,3,4] would be [4,3,5], but here it's [4,3,5] added to the end. Wait, no, the original first row in input is [5,3,4], and the output row is [5,3,4,4,3,5]. So the original array is concatenated with its reverse mirrored. Wait, maybe it's the original array followed by a reversed version but with some modification. Let me check the next rows.\n\nSecond input row is [3,4,5], output is [3,4,5,5,4,3]. So the original row plus reversed. So [3,4,5] concatenated with [5,4,3] reversed? Wait, no, [3,4,5] reversed is [5,4,3], but the output here is [3,4,5,5,4,3]. So it's [3,4,5] followed by [5,4,3]. But wait, the middle element is 4 here. So the reversed part is [5,4,3]. So the original array is followed by its reverse.\n\nWait, but then the third input row in example 0 is [3,4,4]. Output is [3,4,4,4,4,3]. So original array [3,4,4] followed by [4,4,3]. Which is the reverse of the original array. So the pattern here seems to be that each row in the output is the original input row concatenated with its reverse. But the output has six elements, and each input row is three elements. So 3 + 3 = 6. That fits.\n\nBut wait, looking at the outputs in Example 0, the output has six rows. The input has three rows. So how do they map? Let's see. The output for Example 0 has six rows. The first three rows of the output might be the original three rows each concatenated with their reverse. Then the next three rows are the reverse of those first three, but mirrored. Wait, looking at the output:\n\nOriginal input rows (three rows) transformed into first three output rows by appending reversed array. Then the next three rows are the first three rows in reverse order. Let me check:\n\nFirst three output rows:\n\n[5,3,4,4,3,5] \u2192 original [5,3,4] + reversed [4,3,5] (wait, reversed would be [4,3,5], so yes)\n\nSecond row: [3,4,5,5,4,3] \u2192 [3,4,5] + reversed [5,4,3]\n\nThird row: [3,4,4,4,4,3] \u2192 [3,4,4] + reversed [4,4,3]\n\nThen the fourth row is [3,4,4,4,4,3], which is the same as the third row. Fifth row is [3,4,5,5,4,3], same as the second. Sixth row is [5,3,4,4,3,5], same as the first. So the output is the first three rows followed by their mirror in reverse order. So rows 4,5,6 are the same as rows 3,2,1 but mirrored? Wait, maybe the entire output is a symmetrical matrix. Let's see the structure.\n\nWait, the output has six rows and six columns. Let me see if it's a palindrome matrix. For example, the first row is [5,3,4,4,3,5], which is a palindrome. The second row [3,4,5,5,4,3] is also a palindrome. Similarly, all rows in the output are palindromic. Then, looking at the arrangement of the rows, the first three rows are mirrored in the last three rows. For instance, row 0 and row 5 are the same. Row 1 and row 4 are the same. Row 2 and row 3 are the same. So the output is structured such that rows 0-5 are arranged as a palindrome vertically. So the output is a 6x6 matrix where each row is a palindrome (horizontal symmetry) and the entire matrix is vertically symmetric (rows 0-5 mirror each other).\n\nSo the pattern is: For each input row, create a palindromic row by appending its reverse. Then, create the output matrix by taking these palindromic rows and mirroring them vertically. So, if the input has N rows, the output will have 2N rows. Wait, in the examples, input has 3 rows, output has 6 rows, which is 2*3. So for each input row, you generate a palindromic row (original + reversed), and then the output matrix is those rows followed by the same rows in reverse order. Wait, let's check example 0 again:\n\nOriginal input rows after processing (appended with reverse) are rows 0,1,2. Then rows 3,4,5 are the same as rows 2,1,0. So the output is:\n\nrow0: [5,3,4,4,3,5]\n\nrow1: [3,4,5,5,4,3]\n\nrow2: [3,4,4,4,4,3]\n\nrow3: same as row2\n\nrow4: same as row1\n\nrow5: same as row0\n\nSo the overall structure is that the first three rows are processed input rows, and the next three rows are the reverse of the first three. So rows 0-5 are [0,1,2,2,1,0].\n\nSo the steps to transform input to output are:\n\n1. For each input row, create a new row by appending the reverse of the original row. This makes each row a palindrome.\n\n2. Then, arrange these palindromic rows in the output matrix, followed by their mirror image (i.e., the list of rows in reverse order). So if the input has three rows, the output has six rows: the first three are the processed rows, and the next three are the same processed rows in reverse order.\n\nWait, in Example 0, the first three rows of the output are the processed input rows, and the next three rows are the reverse of the processed rows. Wait, the processed rows are:\n\nrow0: [5,3,4,4,3,5]\n\nrow1: [3,4,5,5,4,3]\n\nrow2: [3,4,4,4,4,3]\n\nThe next three rows are row3: same as row2, row4: same as row1, row5: same as row0. So the order is [0,1,2,2,1,0]. So after creating the first three rows (processed input), the next three rows are the same first three rows in reverse order. So for a 3-row input, the output is 6 rows: first 3 processed rows, then the same 3 in reverse. So for example, in Example 0, the first three rows are [0,1,2], the next three rows are [2,1,0].\n\nLet's check another example to confirm. Example 1:\n\nInput has three rows:\n\n[7,1,5]\n\n[7,7,1]\n\n[5,3,1]\n\nProcessed rows (appended with reversed):\n\nrow0: [7,1,5,5,1,7]\n\nrow1: [7,7,1,1,7,7]\n\nrow2: [5,3,1,1,3,5]\n\nThen output rows are:\n\nrow0, row1, row2, row2, row1, row0. So same as Example 0.\n\nYes, looking at the output of Example 1, the rows are:\n\n0: [7,1,5,5,1,7]\n\n1: [7,7,1,1,7,7]\n\n2: [5,3,1,1,3,5]\n\n3: same as row2\n\n4: same as row1\n\n5: same as row0\n\nSo the pattern holds.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\nFor each row in the input, create a new row by appending its reverse. Then, create the output matrix by taking these new rows, followed by the same rows in reverse order.\n\nSo for example, if the input is 3 rows, the output will have 6 rows: first 3 processed rows, then the same 3 in reverse order.\n\nNow, let's apply this to the test input.\n\nTest input:\n\n[1,6,6]\n\n[5,2,2]\n\n[2,2,2]\n\nFirst, process each input row by appending its reverse.\n\nFirst input row: [1,6,6] reversed is [6,6,1], so the processed row is [1,6,6,6,6,1].\n\nSecond row: [5,2,2] reversed is [2,2,5], so processed row is [5,2,2,2,2,5].\n\nThird row: [2,2,2] reversed is [2,2,2], so processed row is [2,2,2,2,2,2].\n\nSo the first three output rows are:\n\n[1,6,6,6,6,1]\n\n[5,2,2,2,2,5]\n\n[2,2,2,2,2,2]\n\nThen the next three rows are the reverse of the first three. So rows 3,4,5 are:\n\nrow3: [2,2,2,2,2,2] (same as row2)\n\nrow4: [5,2,2,2,2,5] (same as row1)\n\nrow5: [1,6,6,6,6,1] (same as row0)\n\nSo the full output would be:\n\n[1,6,6,6,6,1]\n\n[5,2,2,2,2,5]\n\n[2,2,2,2,2,2]\n\n[2,2,2,2,2,2]\n\n[5,2,2,2,2,5]\n\n[1,6,6,6,6,1]\n\nLet me check if this matches the pattern of the training examples. For instance, in Example 3, the third row of the input is [8,1,6], which becomes [8,1,6,6,1,8], and then in the output, it's followed by the same row again (row3 and row4 in Example3 output are the same as the third processed row). So yes, the pattern holds.\n\nThus, applying this to the test input gives the output as above.",

        "cot_2": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. So, looking at the training examples, each input is a list of three lists, each containing three numbers. The output is a list of six lists, each with six numbers.\n\nHmm. Let's take Example 0. The input is three rows: [5,3,4], [3,4,5], [3,4,4]. The output is six rows. Let me see how they relate. \n\nLooking at the first output row in Example 0: [5,3,4,4,3,5]. Wait, that looks like the original first row [5,3,4] followed by its reverse with some modification? Wait, 4,3,5 is the reverse of [5,3,4], but no, the original is [5,3,4], reverse is [4,3,5]. So the output row is original + reverse. So 5,3,4 + 4,3,5? Wait, but the output is [5,3,4,4,3,5]. Oh right, the original followed by the reverse. So each input row is transformed into a row that's the original followed by its reverse. But wait, looking at the output rows for Example 0, the first output row is the first input row concatenated with its reverse. But then the next rows might be the same for the other input rows, but also mirrored in some way.\n\nWait, the output has six rows. The input has three rows. So maybe each input row is processed into two output rows, but arranged in a certain way. Let's check the example 0's output:\n\nThe output is six rows:\n\n[5,3,4,4,3,5]\n[3,4,5,5,4,3]\n[3,4,4,4,4,3]\n[3,4,4,4,4,3]\n[3,4,5,5,4,3]\n[5,3,4,4,3,5]\n\nHmm. Notice that rows 0 and 5 are the same. Rows 1 and 4 are the same. Rows 2 and 3 are the same. So it's symmetrical vertically. Also, each output row is twice the length of the input row. So each input row is being expanded by appending its reverse. But then the output has six rows when the input has three. So perhaps each input row is mirrored in some way, and then the entire structure is mirrored as well.\n\nWait, let's take the first input row of example 0: [5,3,4]. The first output row is [5,3,4,4,3,5], which is the original followed by reversed. Similarly, the second input row is [3,4,5], and the second output row is [3,4,5,5,4,3], again original + reversed. Third input row [3,4,4] becomes [3,4,4,4,4,3]. Then the fourth output row is the same as the third, fifth same as second, sixth same as first. So the output array is a mirror of the first three rows. So the output is the original three rows each expanded by appending their reverse, then mirrored vertically. So the first three rows plus their reversed order copies, making six rows total. So the output is constructed by taking each input row, appending its reverse to make a new row (so each new row is double the length), then the output array is those three rows followed by their mirror image (the same three rows in reverse order), but each of the mirrored rows is also reversed? Wait, no. Wait in example 0, the output's first three rows are the input rows expanded, and then the next three are the same but in reverse order. Let me see:\n\nOriginal input rows are row0, row1, row2. Output rows are:\n\nrow0: input row0 + reversed row0\nrow1: input row1 + reversed row1\nrow2: input row2 + reversed row2\nrow3: same as row2?\nWait in example 0, output row3 is [3,4,4,4,4,3], which is the same as row2. Then row4 is same as row1, and row5 same as row0. So the output is:\n\nOriginal three rows (each extended), followed by the same three rows in reverse order. So rows 0,1,2,2,1,0. Because in example 0, rows 3 is same as row2, row4 same as row1, row5 same as row0. So the output array is a palindrome vertically. So for the output, take each input row, create a new row by appending the reverse of that row. Then arrange these three new rows, followed by the same three rows in reverse order. So the total is 3 + 3 = 6 rows.\n\nWait, but in example 0, the third row of the output is the same as the second row. Wait, maybe the third row is the same as the second input's extended row. Wait, the first three output rows correspond to the input rows. Then the next three are the same as the first three but in reverse order. Let's see:\n\nOriginal input has three rows. For each input row, create a new row that is the original followed by reversed. Then the output is those three new rows, followed by the same three in reverse order. So:\n\nOutput rows 0: input row0 + reversed row0\nOutput rows 1: input row1 + reversed row1\nOutput rows 2: input row2 + reversed row2\nOutput rows 3: input row2 + reversed row2 again? No, because in example 0, row3 is [3,4,4,4,4,3], which is input row2's extended version. Wait, but then row3 is same as row2. Then row4 is input row1's extended version (same as row1), and row5 same as row0. So the output is the three extended rows, then their reverse order. So rows 0,1,2,2,1,0. Wait, in example 0, the output is:\n\n[5,3,4,4,3,5] \u2192 row0\n[3,4,5,5,4,3] \u2192 row1\n[3,4,4,4,4,3] \u2192 row2\n[3,4,4,4,4,3] \u2192 row3 (same as row2)\n[3,4,5,5,4,3] \u2192 row4 (same as row1)\n[5,3,4,4,3,5] \u2192 row5 (same as row0)\n\nSo the output is arranged as row0, row1, row2, row2, row1, row0. So the mirroring is done by appending the reverse of the first three rows. So the total is 6 rows. So for the input's three rows, each becomes a row in the output by appending their reversed, then the output array is those three followed by their mirror (so rows 0,1,2,2,1,0). So that's the vertical mirroring.\n\nSo the steps would be:\n\n1. For each row in the input, create a new row by appending the reverse of that row. So input row [a,b,c] becomes [a,b,c,c,b,a]? Wait no, in example 0, input row0 is [5,3,4]. Its reverse is [4,3,5]. So appending that gives [5,3,4,4,3,5]. Which is length 6, correct.\n\n2. Then arrange these three transformed rows in the output, followed by the same three rows in reverse order. So the output array is:\n\ntransformed_row0\n\ntransformed_row1\n\ntransformed_row2\n\ntransformed_row2\n\ntransformed_row1\n\ntransformed_row0\n\nBut looking at example 0's output, that's exactly what happens. The first three output rows are transformed_row0, transformed_row1, transformed_row2. Then the next three are transformed_row2, transformed_row1, transformed_row0. Wait no. Wait in example 0, the output rows after the first three are [3,4,4,4,4,3] (row3), [3,4,5,5,4,3] (row4), [5,3,4,4,3,5] (row5). So row3 is the same as transformed_row2, row4 same as transformed_row1, row5 same as transformed_row0. So the order is transformed_row0, transformed_row1, transformed_row2, transformed_row2, transformed_row1, transformed_row0. Wait, but in that case, the output is transformed rows followed by the reversed list of transformed rows. So if the transformed rows are [A, B, C], then the output is A, B, C, C, B, A. But that's not exactly the case. Let me check:\n\nIn example 0, the transformed rows are:\n\nA = [5,3,4,4,3,5]\n\nB = [3,4,5,5,4,3]\n\nC = [3,4,4,4,4,3]\n\nThen the output is:\n\nA, B, C, C, B, A. Wait no. The output has six rows:\n\nRow0: A\n\nRow1: B\n\nRow2: C\n\nRow3: C\n\nRow4: B\n\nRow5: A\n\nSo yes, the output is the transformed rows in order, followed by the same rows in reverse order (but without reversing the list). Wait, no. The transformed rows list is [A, B, C]. The output is [A, B, C, C, B, A], which is appending the reverse of the list. Wait, the original list is [A,B,C], reversed is [C,B,A]. So the output is [A,B,C] + [C,B,A] \u2192 [A,B,C,C,B,A]. But in example 0, it's [A,B,C,C,B,A]. Wait no, the output has 6 rows. Let me count:\n\nRow0: A\n\nRow1: B\n\nRow2: C\n\nRow3: C (same as row2)\n\nRow4: B (same as row1)\n\nRow5: A (same as row0)\n\nSo yes, the output is the three transformed rows followed by the same three transformed rows in reverse order. Because [A,B,C] followed by [C,B,A] makes 6 rows. So the total output is 6 rows, first three from input transformed, then the same three in reverse order.\n\nSo the pattern is:\n\nFor each input row, create a new row by appending the reversed version of that row. Then arrange all these transformed rows in the output, followed by the reverse of the list of transformed rows. So the output is the transformed rows list + reversed(transformed rows list). Because transformed rows list has three elements, reversed would make three elements, total six.\n\nLet's check another example. Take example 1.\n\nInput:\n\n[7,1,5], [7,7,1], [5,3,1]\n\nTransformed rows would be:\n\nA: [7,1,5,5,1,7]\n\nB: [7,7,1,1,7,7]\n\nC: [5,3,1,1,3,5]\n\nThen the output would be A, B, C, C, B, A. Let's look at the example 1 output:\n\nOutput rows:\n\n[7,1,5,5,1,7] \u2192 A\n\n[7,7,1,1,7,7] \u2192 B\n\n[5,3,1,1,3,5] \u2192 C\n\n[5,3,1,1,3,5] \u2192 C\n\n[7,7,1,1,7,7] \u2192 B\n\n[7,1,5,5,1,7] \u2192 A\n\nYes, exactly. So the pattern holds.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. For each of the three input rows, create a new row by appending the reversed version of the row. So each new row is original row followed by reversed row.\n\n2. The output is the list of these three transformed rows, followed by the same three transformed rows in reverse order. So the first three rows are the transformed input rows, then the next three are the transformed rows in reverse order (so last becomes fourth, etc.).\n\nSo applying this to the test input.\n\nTest Input:\n\n[1,6,6]\n\n[5,2,2]\n\n[2,2,2]\n\nFirst, transform each input row into a new row by appending its reverse.\n\nRow0: [1,6,6] \u2192 reversed is [6,6,1]. So new row is [1,6,6,6,6,1]\n\nRow1: [5,2,2] \u2192 reversed is [2,2,5]. New row: [5,2,2,2,2,5]\n\nRow2: [2,2,2] \u2192 reversed is [2,2,2]. New row: [2,2,2,2,2,2]\n\nSo transformed rows are:\n\nA: [1,6,6,6,6,1]\n\nB: [5,2,2,2,2,5]\n\nC: [2,2,2,2,2,2]\n\nNow the output should be A, B, C, then C, B, A.\n\nSo the output rows in order are:\n\nRow0: [1,6,6,6,6,1]\n\nRow1: [5,2,2,2,2,5]\n\nRow2: [2,2,2,2,2,2]\n\nRow3: [2,2,2,2,2,2]\n\nRow4: [5,2,2,2,2,5]\n\nRow5: [1,6,6,6,6,1]\n\nLet's check if this matches the pattern from the training examples. For example, in example 3, the input rows are [1,2,1], [2,8,1], [8,1,6]. The transformed rows would be:\n\n[1,2,1,1,2,1], [2,8,1,1,8,2], [8,1,6,6,1,8]. Then the output is these three rows followed by their reverse order. Which matches the given output.\n\nSo applying this pattern to the test input, the output should be as described above."
