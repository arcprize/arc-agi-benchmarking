        "cot_1": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. So, looking at the training examples, each input is a 3x3 matrix, and the output is a 6x6 matrix. The first step is to understand how the input is transformed into the output.\n\nLooking at Example 0:\nInput is three rows [3,3,3], [0,2,2], [1,1,0]. The output is a 6x6 matrix. Let me check the output rows. The first row in the output is [3,3,3,3,3,3]. So it seems like the original row is mirrored and expanded. Wait, original input row is length 3, output is length 6. So each row in the input becomes a row in the output but extended by mirroring. But how?\n\nWait, in example 0, the first input row [3,3,3] becomes [3,3,3,3,3,3]. So it's just the same three elements repeated again. But maybe it's mirrored? Let me check the second input row [0,2,2]. The output row is [0,2,2,2,2,0]. So original elements are 0,2,2. The output is 0,2,2 followed by 2,2,0. So it's like the original row followed by its reverse without the first element. Wait, original [0,2,2] reversed is [2,2,0]. If we take the original, then the reversed (excluding the first element?), but no. Let's see: the first three elements are 0,2,2. Then the next three would be 2,2,0. So the entire row is original + reversed. But reversed as a whole. Wait, original is [0,2,2], reversed is [2,2,0], so combining gives [0,2,2,2,2,0]. So yes, the row is mirrored. So each row in the input is mirrored to form the first half and the second half of the output row. But wait, the output row is twice the length. So for a 3-element row, the mirrored version would be original followed by reverse. That would make 6 elements. That seems to fit.\n\nBut looking at the second example, input row [3,3,1] becomes [3,3,1,1,3,3]. Original is 3,3,1. Reversed is 1,3,3. So combining gives 3,3,1,1,3,3. So yes, original + reversed. Similarly, the third row [0,2,2] becomes [0,2,2,2,2,0], which is original [0,2,2] plus reversed [2,2,0]. Wait, but reversed of [0,2,2] is [2,2,0], so combining gives [0,2,2,2,2,0]. So same as before.\n\nSo the first part of the pattern is that each row in the input is transformed into a row in the output by concatenating the original row with its reversed version. That doubles the length from 3 to 6.\n\nBut wait, the output matrix has 6 rows. So the input is 3x3, output is 6x6. So rows are also being duplicated and arranged in a mirrored fashion vertically. Let's check the examples.\n\nIn Example 0's output, the rows are:\n\nRow 0: [3,3,3,3,3,3]\n\nRow 1: [0,2,2,2,2,0]\n\nRow 2: [1,1,0,0,1,1]\n\nRow 3: [1,1,0,0,1,1]\n\nRow 4: [0,2,2,2,2,0]\n\nRow 5: [3,3,3,3,3,3]\n\nSo the first three rows of the output are the transformed input rows (each input row mirrored), and then the next three rows are the mirror of the first three. So row 3 is same as row 2, row 4 same as row 1, row 5 same as row 0. So the output matrix is a vertical mirror of the transformed input rows. So the entire output is created by taking each input row, mirroring it horizontally to make a 6-element row, and then mirroring those rows vertically to make the 6x6 matrix.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. For each row in the input, create a new row by mirroring it. For example, [a, b, c] becomes [a, b, c, c, b, a]?\n\nWait, in example 0, the first input row is [3,3,3], which becomes [3,3,3,3,3,3]. So mirroring [3,3,3] would add the same elements. But for [0,2,2], mirrored is [0,2,2,2,2,0]. Wait, original is [0,2,2], reversed is [2,2,0], so combining gives [0,2,2,2,2,0]. Wait, that's original followed by reversed without the first element? No, original is three elements, reversed is three elements. So combining them gives six elements. So yes, original followed by reversed. So [a,b,c] becomes [a,b,c, c,b,a]?\n\nWait in example 1, input row [3,3,1] becomes [3,3,1,1,3,3]. So original is [3,3,1], reversed is [1,3,3]. So concatenated gives [3,3,1,1,3,3]. So yes, original followed by reversed. Similarly, [0,2,2] becomes [0,2,2,2,2,0]. Wait, reversed of [0,2,2] is [2,2,0]. So original plus reversed gives [0,2,2,2,2,0]. So yes.\n\nSo the first step is for each row in the input, create a row by concatenating the original row with its reversed version.\n\nThen, the second step is to mirror these rows vertically. So the transformed rows (after horizontal mirroring) are arranged in the order of the input rows, followed by their mirror. So for the input rows 0,1,2, the output rows would be 0,1,2, 2,1,0.\n\nIn example 0, the transformed rows after horizontal mirroring are:\n\nRow 0: [3,3,3,3,3,3]\n\nRow 1: [0,2,2,2,2,0]\n\nRow 2: [1,1,0,0,1,1]\n\nThen rows 3,4,5 are copies of row 2,1,0. So the output matrix is a vertical mirror of the transformed rows. So the output is the transformed rows followed by the transformed rows in reverse order (excluding the middle row if even, but here 3 rows, so after adding three, then adding the same three in reverse).\n\nWait in example 0, the output has 6 rows. The first three are the transformed input rows. Then the next three are the same transformed rows but in reverse order. So row 3 is same as row 2, row 4 same as row 1, row 5 same as row 0.\n\nSo the vertical mirroring is taking the transformed rows and appending their reverse. So the total rows in output is double the input rows (3x2=6). But wait, input is 3 rows, output 6 rows. So yes.\n\nSo the pattern is:\n\n1. For each row in the input, create a new row by concatenating the original row with its reversed version. So each input row becomes a row of double the length.\n\n2. Then, take these transformed rows and mirror them vertically. That is, after the transformed rows, append the same rows in reverse order (excluding the middle if odd). Wait, the input has 3 rows. So the transformed rows are 3 rows. Then append them in reverse order (rows 2,1,0) to get 6 rows.\n\nSo putting it all together, the output matrix is formed by:\n\n- For each row in the input, create a new row by original + reversed.\n\n- Then, stack these new rows and their reversed (so the first three transformed rows, then the same three in reverse order).\n\nTesting this with Example 0:\n\nTransformed rows:\n\nRow0: [3,3,3,3,3,3]\n\nRow1: [0,2,2,2,2,0]\n\nRow2: [1,1,0,0,1,1]\n\nThen, append rows2, row1, row0. So the output becomes:\n\nRow0, row1, row2, row2, row1, row0.\n\nWhich matches the output in Example 0.\n\nSimilarly, Example1:\n\nInput rows:\n\n[3,3,1] \u2192 [3,3,1,1,3,3]\n\n[1,3,0] \u2192 [1,3,0,0,3,1]\n\n[0,2,2] \u2192 [0,2,2,2,2,0]\n\nThen, these three rows, followed by reversed order: same three rows in reverse. So row2 (transformed [0,2,2...]) becomes row3, row1 becomes row4, row0 becomes row5. So output rows are 0,1,2,2,1,0. Which matches the example.\n\nSo that's the pattern.\n\nNow, applying this to the test input:\n\nTest input is:\n\n[1,1,0]\n\n[0,3,2]\n\n[3,3,0]\n\nFirst step: transform each row.\n\nRow0: [1,1,0] \u2192 concatenated with reversed [0,1,1] \u2192 [1,1,0,0,1,1]\n\nRow1: [0,3,2] \u2192 reversed is [2,3,0], so concatenated \u2192 [0,3,2,2,3,0]\n\nRow2: [3,3,0] \u2192 reversed is [0,3,3], so concatenated \u2192 [3,3,0,0,3,3]\n\nThen, the transformed rows are:\n\n0: [1,1,0,0,1,1]\n\n1: [0,3,2,2,3,0]\n\n2: [3,3,0,0,3,3]\n\nThen, the vertical mirroring: append rows2, row1, row0.\n\nSo the full output matrix would be:\n\nRow0: [1,1,0,0,1,1]\n\nRow1: [0,3,2,2,3,0]\n\nRow2: [3,3,0,0,3,3]\n\nRow3: [3,3,0,0,3,3]\n\nRow4: [0,3,2,2,3,0]\n\nRow5: [1,1,0,0,1,1]\n\nSo the output should be as above.",

        "cot_2": "Okay, let's tackle this puzzle. So, the task is to figure out the pattern from the training examples and apply it to the test input. Let's start by looking at the examples provided.\n\nFirst, let's examine Example 0. The input is a 3x3 matrix:\n\n[3, 3, 3]\n[0, 2, 2]\n[1, 1, 0]\n\nThe output is a 6x6 matrix. Wait, the output dimensions double in size? Because 3x3 becomes 6x6. Let me check the other examples to confirm. Example 1's input is also 3x3 and output 6x6. Example 2 same. So the pattern involves expanding the input matrix into a larger one, probably by mirroring or reflecting in some way.\n\nLooking at the output of Example 0. The first row of the input is [3,3,3], and the output's first row is [3,3,3,3,3,3]. So it looks like each row is mirrored. Wait, but the length doubles. So original row has 3 elements, output has 6. Let's see: original row is [a,b,c], output becomes [a,b,c,c,b,a]? Wait in Example 0's first input row: [3,3,3] becomes [3,3,3,3,3,3], which is just all 3s. So maybe each row is mirrored, but for even-length rows? Wait, but in the output rows, maybe the original row is followed by a reversed copy except the first element? Hmm.\n\nWait, let's look at Example 0's second input row: [0,2,2]. The output row is [0,2,2,2,2,0]. So the original row is 0,2,2. Then the output adds 2,2,0. Wait, the original row is 3 elements. So perhaps the output is the original row concatenated with a reversed version of itself (excluding the first element?) Let's see: Original [0,2,2] reversed is [2,2,0]. So if we take the original and then the reversed, but the total would be 6 elements. So [0,2,2] + [2,2,0] gives [0,2,2,2,2,0]. Oh, that works. So each row in the input is followed by its reverse, but perhaps without the first element. Wait, let's check that. For the input row [3,3,3], reversing gives [3,3,3], so concatenating gives [3,3,3,3,3,3], which matches the output. For the input row [1,1,0], reversing gives [0,1,1], so concatenating would give [1,1,0,0,1,1]. Which matches the third row of the output. So that seems to be the row transformation.\n\nSo each row in the input is transformed into a row that is the original followed by the reverse of the original. Wait, but the original length is 3. When reversed, it's 3 elements, so concatenated, that's 6 elements. So that's how each row is expanded.\n\nBut then how about the rows in the output matrix? The output matrix has 6 rows. Let's look at Example 0's output rows:\n\nRow 0: [3,3,3,3,3,3]\nRow 1: [0,2,2,2,2,0]\nRow 2: [1,1,0,0,1,1]\nRow 3: [1,1,0,0,1,1]\nRow 4: [0,2,2,2,2,0]\nRow 5: [3,3,3,3,3,3]\n\nSo the output is symmetrical vertically. The first three rows are the input rows transformed, and then the next three rows are the mirror of the first three, but in reverse order. Wait, looking at rows 0 and 5 are the same. Rows 1 and 4 are the same. Rows 2 and 3 are the same. So the output matrix is created by taking the transformed input rows, then appending their mirror (but in reverse order). So for example, the original input has 3 rows. The output has 6 rows. The first three rows are the transformed input rows, and then the next three are the same as the first three but in reverse order. Wait, in Example 0, the output rows 0,1,2 are the transformed input rows. Then rows 3,4,5 are rows 2,1,0 of the transformed input. Wait, no. Because row 3 is same as row 2. Row 4 is same as row 1. Row 5 same as row 0. So the output is constructed by taking the transformed input rows and then mirroring them vertically, appending the reverse. So for a 3-row input, the output is 6 rows: original transformed rows followed by the same rows in reverse order. So input rows [A,B,C] become output rows [A,B,C,C,B,A]. Wait, no, because the output has [A,B,C] followed by [C,B,A] but each of those is a transformed row. Wait, in Example 0, the transformed input rows are:\n\nA: [3,3,3,3,3,3] (original row 0)\nB: [0,2,2,2,2,0] (original row 1)\nC: [1,1,0,0,1,1] (original row 2)\n\nThen the output's rows are [A,B,C,C,B,A]? Wait no, the output has A, B, C, then C, B, A. Let me see:\n\nRow 0: A\nRow 1: B\nRow 2: C\nRow 3: C\nRow 4: B\nRow 5: A\n\nYes. So the output matrix is created by taking each input row, transforming it by appending its reverse (to make each row double in length), and then stacking the transformed rows followed by the same transformed rows in reverse order (excluding the first, perhaps). So for a 3-row input, the output has 6 rows: the transformed rows, then the transformed rows in reverse order. So rows 0,1,2 become rows 0,1,2,2,1,0. Wait, in Example 0, the output rows after the first three are the same as the first three in reverse. Wait, rows 3,4,5 are the same as rows 2,1,0. Let's check:\n\nRow 3 is same as row 2: [1,1,0,0,1,1]\nRow 4 same as row 1: [0,2,2,2,2,0]\nRow 5 same as row 0: [3,3,3,3,3,3]\n\nYes. So the output matrix is the transformed input rows followed by the reversed list of transformed rows. So for 3 input rows, the output is transformed_input_rows + transformed_input_rows[::-1]. But wait, transformed_input_rows is 3 rows. Adding their reversed order would make 6 rows. Let me confirm with Example 0:\n\nTransformed input rows:\n\nRow 0: A\nRow 1: B\nRow 2: C\n\nThen the output rows are A, B, C, C, B, A? No, because the output is:\n\nA\n\nB\n\nC\n\nC\n\nB\n\nA\n\nWait no. Wait the output for Example 0's rows are:\n\n0: A\n\n1: B\n\n2: C\n\n3: C\n\n4: B\n\n5: A\n\nWhich is the transformed rows followed by reversed transformed rows. So transformed rows list is [A, B, C], reversed is [C, B, A]. But in the output, after the first three rows, it's [C, B, A]. Wait, no. The output after the first three is [C, B, A], but that would make the total rows 6. Let me check:\n\nOriginal 3 rows: [A, B, C]\n\nThen appending reversed list [C, B, A] gives 6 rows: A, B, C, C, B, A. Wait, that's not matching the example. Because in Example 0's output, after the first three rows (A, B, C), the next three are C, B, A. Wait, but the output rows 3,4,5 are C, B, A. So the entire output is the transformed input rows followed by their reverse. So yes, the vertical mirroring is the original rows followed by the same rows in reverse order.\n\nSo the process is:\n\n1. For each row in the input, create a new row by concatenating the original row with its reverse. For example, input row [a, b, c] becomes [a, b, c, c, b, a] (Wait, no. Wait in Example 0, the input row [0,2,2] becomes [0,2,2,2,2,0]. Original is [0,2,2]. Reverse is [2,2,0]. So concatenating [0,2,2] + [2,2,0] gives [0,2,2,2,2,0]. So yes, each row is the original followed by the reversed original.\n\nBut wait, in the case of a row with odd length (3 elements), the reversed row is added. So for even length, maybe it's similar? But all input rows in training examples are 3 elements. Let's check another example.\n\nTake Example 1's input row [3,3,1]. The output row is [3,3,1,1,3,3]. Original is [3,3,1], reversed is [1,3,3], so concatenating gives [3,3,1,1,3,3]. Yes. So each input row is transformed by adding the reverse of itself. So for a 3-element row, it's original + reversed, resulting in 6 elements.\n\nThen, for the vertical direction: the input has 3 rows, transformed into 3 rows (each of length 6). Then, the output matrix is these 3 transformed rows followed by the same 3 rows in reverse order. So for example, if the transformed rows are A, B, C, then the output is:\n\nA\n\nB\n\nC\n\nC\n\nB\n\nA\n\nWait, but in Example 0's output, rows 3,4,5 are C, B, A. So the vertical arrangement is the transformed rows followed by their reverse. So for 3 rows, the output has 6 rows: original 3 transformed rows, then the same 3 in reverse order.\n\nSo combining both horizontal and vertical mirroring: each row is mirrored horizontally (original + reversed), and the entire matrix is mirrored vertically (original rows + reversed rows).\n\nSo the pattern is:\n\nFor each row in the input:\n\n- Double the row by appending its reversed version.\n\nFor the entire matrix:\n\n- After expanding all rows, append the reversed list of the expanded rows (so the matrix is mirrored vertically).\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Take each row of the input and create a new row by appending the reverse of the row. So [a,b,c] becomes [a,b,c,c,b,a].\n\n2. Take the list of these transformed rows and append the reverse of this list. So if the transformed rows are [A,B,C], the final matrix is [A,B,C,C,B,A].\n\nSo applying this to the test input.\n\nTest input is:\n\n[1, 1, 0]\n\n[0, 3, 2]\n\n[3, 3, 0]\n\nFirst, transform each row.\n\nFirst row [1,1,0]: reverse is [0,1,1]. So transformed row is [1,1,0,0,1,1].\n\nSecond row [0,3,2]: reversed is [2,3,0]. So transformed row is [0,3,2,2,3,0].\n\nThird row [3,3,0]: reversed is [0,3,3]. So transformed row is [3,3,0,0,3,3].\n\nSo the transformed rows are:\n\nRow 0: [1,1,0,0,1,1]\n\nRow 1: [0,3,2,2,3,0]\n\nRow 2: [3,3,0,0,3,3]\n\nThen, the matrix is these three rows followed by the reversed list of these rows. So after the three transformed rows, we add the reversed list. So the reversed list is [Row 2, Row 1, Row 0].\n\nSo the full output matrix is:\n\nRow 0: [1,1,0,0,1,1]\n\nRow 1: [0,3,2,2,3,0]\n\nRow 2: [3,3,0,0,3,3]\n\nRow 3: [3,3,0,0,3,3]\n\nRow 4: [0,3,2,2,3,0]\n\nRow 5: [1,1,0,0,1,1]\n\nLet me check if this matches the training examples' pattern. For example, in Example 2, the test input's output would follow the same steps. Let me verify with Example 2's input:\n\nInput:\n\n[2,1,0]\n\n[0,2,3]\n\n[0,3,0]\n\nTransformed rows:\n\nFirst row [2,1,0] reversed is [0,1,2]. So transformed row becomes [2,1,0,0,1,2]. Which matches the first row of the output in Example 2.\n\nSimilarly, the second row [0,2,3] reversed is [3,2,0], so transformed row is [0,2,3,3,2,0], which matches the second output row.\n\nThird row [0,3,0] reversed is [0,3,0], so transformed row is [0,3,0,0,3,0].\n\nThen the output rows are:\n\n[2,1,0,0,1,2]\n\n[0,2,3,3,2,0]\n\n[0,3,0,0,3,0]\n\nThen followed by the reversed list of these rows, which would be the same three rows in reverse order. So rows 3,4,5 are:\n\n[0,3,0,0,3,0]\n\n[0,2,3,3,2,0]\n\n[2,1,0,0,1,2]\n\nWhich matches the example's output.\n\nSo applying this to the test input, the answer should be the transformed rows followed by the reversed transformed rows.\n\nSo the final output for the test input is:\n\n[1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1]\n\n[0, 3, 2, 2, 3, 0]\n\n[3, 3, 0, 0, 3, 3]\n\n[3, 3, 0, 0, 3, 3]\n\n[0, 3, 2, 2, 3, 0]\n\n[1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1]"
