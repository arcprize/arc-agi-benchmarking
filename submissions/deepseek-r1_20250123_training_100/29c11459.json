        "cot_1": "Okay, let's see. I need to figure out the pattern that transforms the input grids into the output grids in the training examples. Then apply that to the test input.\n\nLooking at Example 0. The input has a row [1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2]. The output for that row is [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 5, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2]. Hmm. So the first element is 1, then a bunch of 1s, then a 5 in the middle, then 2s. The original row had 1 at the start and 2 at the end. So maybe the 1 and 2 are spreading towards the center, and the middle becomes 5. The output row has 5 elements of 1, then 5 of 2, with 5 in the middle. Since the original row has 11 elements, the middle is position 5 (0-based index 5). So 1s go up to index 4, then index 5 is 5, and from 6 to 10 are 2s.\n\nSimilarly, in Example 1, the input row is [3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7]. The output is [3,3,3,3,3,5,7,7,7,7,7]. Again, the same pattern. The first element 3 spreads to the first five positions, then the middle is 5, then the last element 7 spreads to the last five. So the pattern seems to be: take the first and last elements of the row, and expand them towards the center, each covering the first half and second half, with the middle element being the sum or maybe average? Wait, in example 0, 1 and 2. Middle is 5. 1+2=3, but 5 is the middle. Wait, 5 is the fifth position (0-based index 5). Or maybe 5 is 1 + 2 + 2 (since there are two numbers?), but that doesn't add up. Alternatively, maybe the middle is the average of the first and last elements multiplied by something. Wait 1 and 2: average is 1.5, but 5 is higher. Hmm, maybe not. Alternatively, maybe 5 is a fixed value when the row has non-zero first and last elements. Wait in example 1, 3 and 7. The middle is 5 again. So 3 + 7 = 10, but 5 is half of that. Wait 3 +7 is 10, divided by 2 is 5. Oh! So the middle element is the average of the first and last non-zero elements. So in example 0, (1+2)/2 = 1.5, but the output has 5. Wait that doesn't fit. Wait example 0's output middle is 5, and example 1's is 5 as well. Wait that's a problem. Because 3 and 7 average to 5, which fits. But 1 and 2 average to 1.5, but the middle is 5. That's not matching. Hmm, maybe another approach.\n\nLooking at the structure: the non-zero elements in the input row are at the first and last positions. The output row replaces them by spreading those numbers towards the center, but stopping before the middle, which is set to 5. Wait in both examples, the middle is 5. So maybe regardless of the input numbers, the middle is always 5. But how? In example 0, the middle element becomes 5, which is between 1 and 2? Or perhaps the middle is the sum of the first and last elements. 1 + 2 = 3, not 5. No. Hmm. Wait maybe the middle is 5 in both cases because it's the fifth position (if considering 1-based, perhaps?), but that might not make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the 5 is a fixed value whenever there are two non-zero elements in the row. Because in both training examples, the input rows with two non-zero elements (the first and last) result in the middle being 5. Then the output replaces the first five elements (positions 0-4) with the first non-zero value, the middle (position 5) with 5, and the last five (positions 6-10) with the last non-zero value.\n\nSo the pattern is:\n\nFor any row that has exactly two non-zero elements at the first and last positions:\n\n- The first five elements (indices 0-4) are set to the first non-zero value.\n- The middle element (index 5) is set to 5.\n- The last five elements (indices 6-10) are set to the last non-zero value.\n\nOther rows (all zeros) remain unchanged.\n\nSo in example 0, the input row [1,0,...0,2] becomes [1,1,1,1,1,5,2,2,2,2,2].\n\nIn example 1, the input row [3,0,...0,7] becomes [3,3,3,3,3,5,7,7,7,7,7].\n\nSo the middle is always 5. Then, the first five positions are filled with the first number, the last five with the second number.\n\nNow, looking at the test input. The test input has two rows with non-zero elements. The first non-zero row is [4,0,...0,8], and the fourth row is [6,0,...0,9]. So applying the same pattern:\n\nFor the row [4,0,...0,8], the output should be [4,4,4,4,4,5,8,8,8,8,8].\n\nFor the row [6,0,...0,9], the output should be [6,6,6,6,6,5,9,9,9,9,9].\n\nThe other rows (all zeros) remain unchanged.\n\nSo the test input is:\n\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n[4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8]\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n[6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,9]\n\nSo the output would have the second row transformed as [4,4,4,4,4,5,8,8,8,8,8], the fifth row as [6,6,6,6,6,5,9,9,9,9,9], and the rest as zeros.",

        "cot_2": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. So, looking at the training examples, the inputs are matrices with some numbers and zeros. The outputs seem to modify certain rows. Let's start with Example 0.\n\nIn Example 0's input, the second row starts with 1 and ends with 2. The output for that row becomes [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 5, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2]. So it looks like the first number (1) is spread to the left up to the middle, then there's a 5 in the center, and the last number (2) is spread to the right. The middle position is index 5 in an 11-element list (since indices start at 0). So the 5 is in the middle.\n\nSimilarly, in Example 1, the fourth row has 3 and 7 at the ends. The output row is [3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 5, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7]. Again, the first number spreads left up to the middle, then 5 in the center, and the last number spreads right. So the middle element is always 5, and the non-zero numbers from the input row's first and last elements are extended towards the center, replacing the zeros with their own values, and inserting 5 in the middle.\n\nNow, the test input has two rows with non-zero elements. The second row starts with 4 and ends with 8. Following the pattern, this row should become [4,4,4,4,4,5,8,8,8,8,8]. The fifth row starts with 6 and ends with 9, so that row would become [6,6,6,6,6,5,9,9,9,9,9]. The other rows remain all zeros. Let me check if that makes sense with the examples. Yes, in the training examples, only the row with non-zero endpoints is modified, inserting 5 in the middle. So applying the same logic to the test input should work."
