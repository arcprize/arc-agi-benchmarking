        "cot_1": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. So, looking at the training examples, the inputs are lists of numbers, and the outputs are modified versions of those lists. My job is to find out how the input is transformed into the output.\n\nStarting with Example 0. The input has three rows. Let's look at each row in the input and see how they become the output rows.\n\nOriginal Input 0:\nRow 0: [0,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\nRow 1: [2,2,0,5,1,0,5,2,2]\nRow 2: [0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,0]\n\nOutput 0:\n[0,2,1,1,0,0,0]\n[2,2,0,1,2,2,2]\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nHmm. The output rows are shorter in length than the input. For example, input row 0 is length 9, output row 0 is length 7. So maybe some elements are being combined or removed. Let's compare the elements.\n\nLooking at row 0 of input and output. Input starts with 0,5,0,0... Output starts with 0,2,1,1. Wait, where do the 2 and 1s come from? Maybe they are taking values from the next row. Let me check.\n\nIn output row 0, the second element is 2. In input row 1, the first two elements are 2,2. Maybe there's some kind of merging between adjacent rows. For instance, each element in the output is a combination of the elements from the same position in the three input rows. Or perhaps it's a vertical sum or some operation between the rows.\n\nWait, maybe the output is derived by looking at each column in the input and combining them in some way. Let's check column-wise.\n\nTake the first column of input Example 0:\n0 (row0), 2 (row1), 0 (row2). Output row0's first element is 0, which matches row0's first element. Output row1's first element is 2, which is row1's first element. Output row2's first element is 0, which is row2's first. But then the output rows are shorter. Maybe the columns are being processed in a way that combines adjacent columns?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each output row is a transformation of the input rows but only considering certain elements. Let's look at how the numbers change.\n\nAnother approach: Maybe the output rows are derived from the input by collapsing sequences of zeros. For example, if there's a non-zero followed by zeros, maybe the zeros are removed. But in Example 0's output row0, there's a 0, then 2,1,1,0,0,0. That doesn't fit. Alternatively, maybe when there's a 5 in row0, it's replaced by values from row1 and row2.\n\nWait, looking at Example 0's input row0: the second element is 5. In the output row0, the second element is 2, which is the value of row1's first element (which is 2). Then the next element in output row0 is 1, which is from row1's fourth element (5?) Wait, maybe not. Let me check.\n\nWait, maybe each 5 in a row is replaced by the sum or some combination of the elements in the same position from the other rows. Let's test this.\n\nIn Example 0, input row0 has a 5 at position 1. The output row0 has 2 and 1s. Looking at the same column (position 1), row1 is 2, row2 is 0. Maybe 5 is replaced by the sum of the other two rows in that column? 2 + 0 = 2. But the output in row0 has a 2 followed by 1,1. Maybe there's a different rule.\n\nAlternatively, when a 5 appears in a row, it's replaced by the values from the row below. For example, in input row0, the 5 is at position1. The row below (row1) in position1 is 2, which becomes the output in row0's position1. Then, maybe the 5 in row0's position1 triggers taking values from row1. But how does that lead to the 1s?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps 5 acts as a \"pipe\" that transfers values from the row below. For example, when there's a 5 in a cell, the cell above (if any) or below (if any) gets the value from another row.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 5s are markers that need to be replaced by adjacent numbers. Let's look at Example 0's input row1: there's a 5 at position3. The output row1's position3 is 1. Hmm. Input row1's position3 is 5. The output is 1. That's different.\n\nWait, in Example0's input:\n\nRow0: [0,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\nRow1: [2,2,0,5,1,0,5,2,2]\nRow2: [0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,0]\n\nOutput rows are:\n\nRow0: [0,2,1,1,0,0,0]\nRow1: [2,2,0,1,2,2,2]\nRow2: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nLooking at row0's output. The 5 in input row0 is replaced by 2 and 1,1. Where do these numbers come from? Let's see the columns. In the input, the 5 in row0 is at index1. The same column in row1 is 2 (since row1's index1 is 2). Row2's index1 is 0. So maybe the 5 is replaced by 2 (from row1) and 0 (from row2), but the output is 2,1,1. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe when there's a 5 in a row, it takes the next non-zero elements from the rows below. Let's check in Example0.\n\nIn input row0, position1 is 5. The rows below in column1 are 2 (row1) and 0 (row2). So maybe that 5 is replaced by 2 (from row1) and then some other numbers. But the output row0 has 0,2,1,1,... Maybe the 5 in row0's position1 is replaced by the sum or sequence from the rows below.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each 5 is replaced by the values from the row below it. For example, if a row has a 5 in position i, then the output at that position takes the value from the row below. But in row0, position1 has 5, which is replaced by row1's value at position1 (2). Then in the output row0, position1 is 2. The next positions in output row0 are 1 and 1. Maybe those come from row1's next elements. Let's see: row1's elements after position1 are 2,0,5,1,0,5,2,2. Wait, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps when a 5 is in a row, it's replaced by the values from the same column in the rows below. For example, in row0, column1 has 5. So the output in row0, column1 takes the value from row1, column1 (2) and row2, column1 (0). But how that becomes 2,1,1? Maybe there's a different process.\n\nAnother approach: Let's check if the outputs are a combination of the three input rows, but summed or merged in some way. For example, output rows could be the sum of the three input rows for each column. Let's check:\n\nIn Example0, output row0 is [0,2,1,1,0,0,0]. Let's see the columns:\n\nColumn0: 0 (row0) +2 (row1)+0 (row2) =2. But output row0's first element is 0. Doesn't match.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's the maximum of each column across the three rows. For column0, the max is 2 (from row1). But output row0's first element is 0. So that's not it.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output rows are derived by taking each element from the input rows but replacing 5s with something. Let's count the number of 5s in the input and how they are replaced.\n\nIn Example0 input:\n\nRow0 has one 5 at position1.\nRow1 has two 5s at positions3 and 6.\nRow2 has one 5 at position4.\n\nIn the output:\n\nRow0: the 5 in row0 input is replaced by 2,1,1. But how?\n\nWait, output row0 has elements [0,2,1,1,0,0,0]. Original row0 is [0,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]. So the 5 is replaced by 2,1,1. But how?\n\nLooking at the surrounding elements in the same column for other rows. The 5 is in column1. Row1's column1 is 2, row2's column1 is 0. So maybe 5 is replaced by row1's value (2) and then some elements from the next columns. Wait, row1's column2 is 0, column3 is5. But the output row0 has 2 followed by 1,1. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe when a 5 is present in a row, it's replaced by the next non-zero value in the same row of the next rows. For example, row0 has 5 at position1. Then, in row1, the next non-zero after position1 is at position3 (5). But how does that relate to the output?\n\nThis approach is getting a bit stuck. Let's look at another example.\n\nExample1 input:\n\nRow0: [0,0,0,5,1,5,0,0,0,0,0]\nRow1: [2,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,3,3]\nRow2: [0,5,0,0,0,0,0,5,3,0,0]\n\nOutput1:\n\nRow0: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\nRow1: [2,2,0,0,0,0,3,3,3]\nRow2: [0,2,1,1,1,3,3,0,0]\n\nIn row0 of the input, there are two 5s at positions3 and5. The output row0 is all zeros. So maybe any 5 in row0 is replaced by zero? But why then in Example0, the 5 in row0 became 2,1,1. So that's inconsistent.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each 5 in a row is replaced by the sum of the elements in the same column from the other rows, but that might not fit.\n\nIn Example1's input row0, position3 is 5. Other rows in column3: row1 has 0, row2 has 0. So sum is 0+0=0. Output row0's position3 is 0, which matches. But in Example0's input row0, position1 is5. Other rows in column1 are 2 (row1) and 0 (row2). Sum is 2. Output row0's position1 is 2. Then the next elements in output row0 are 1,1. Where do they come from?\n\nWait, in Example0's output row0, after the initial 0,2,1,1, then zeros. The input row0 after the 5 has a series of zeros. So maybe the 5 in row0 is replaced by 2 (from row1's column1) and then some values from row1's subsequent columns. For example, row1's column2 is 0, column3 is5, column4 is1. But output row0's next elements after 2 are 1,1. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe when a 5 is present in a row, it's replaced by the values from the same and next positions in the row below. For example, in Example0, row0's 5 is at position1. The row below (row1) has in positions1-3: 2,0,5. So the 5 is replaced by 2,0,5. But the output row0 has 2,1,1. That doesn't match.\n\nAnother idea: Maybe 5s are acting as \"links\" between the rows, and when a 5 is present, the corresponding position in the output is a combination of the adjacent rows' values. For example, in row0, column1 has a 5. Then, the output row0's column1 takes the value from row1's column1 (2), and the output row1's column1 takes the value from row0's column1 (5) but transformed, but not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the process is that for each row in the output, you look at the three rows above and merge them. For example, in output row0, each element is the sum of the three input rows in that column, but then some transformation is applied. Let's check:\n\nIn Example0, output row0's first element is 0. Input columns sum to 0+2+0=2, but output is 0. So that's not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output rows are the result of collapsing the three input rows into a single row, but that's not the case here since the output has three rows as well.\n\nWait, the output has the same number of rows as the input. So each output row corresponds to an input row but modified.\n\nWait, looking at Example0's output rows:\n\nRow0: [0,2,1,1,0,0,0]\nRow1: [2,2,0,1,2,2,2]\nRow2: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nComparing input row0 (length9) to output row0 (length7). So the output is shorter. So maybe some columns are being removed or merged.\n\nAnother possibility is that when there's a 5 in any row, the corresponding column is processed in a certain way, perhaps combining elements from all three rows and then shortening the array.\n\nLooking at Example0's input columns:\n\nColumn0: 0,2,0 \u2192 Output row0 is 0, row1 is2, row2 is0. So remains the same?\n\nBut output row0 has 7 elements, input has 9. So maybe columns are merged when certain conditions are met.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps whenever a 5 appears in a column, the elements from the rows above and below are merged into the current row's output. For example, in a column where there's a 5 in row0, then that column is processed by taking values from row1 and row2 and merging them into row0's output. But I'm not sure.\n\nAnother approach: Let's look at the positions where 5 occurs in the input and see how they are transformed in the output.\n\nIn Example0 input:\n\nRow0 has 5 at position1. Output row0 has 2 at position1, then 1,1 at positions2 and3.\n\nRow1 has 5s at positions3 and6. Output row1 has 1 at position3 and 2 at position6.\n\nRow2 has 5 at position4. Output row2 is all zeros, so that 5 is replaced by 0.\n\nIn Example1 input:\n\nRow0 has 5s at positions3 and5. Output row0 is all zeros. So those 5s are replaced by 0.\n\nRow1 has no 5s. Output row1 is similar to input row1 but shorter.\n\nRow2 has 5s at positions1 and7. Output row2 has 2 at position1 and 3,3 at positions5 and6.\n\nIn Example2 input:\n\nRow0 has 5 at position6. Output row0 is all zeros.\n\nRow1 has 5 at position4. Output row1 has 0 at position4.\n\nRow2 has 5s at positions2 and8. Output row2 has 2 at position2 and 0 at position8.\n\nHmm. Maybe whenever there's a 5 in a row, the output for that row in the same column is replaced by the value from the row below. For example, if a 5 is in row0, column i, then in the output row0, column i is replaced by row1's column i value. Similarly, if a 5 is in row1, column i, output row1's column i is replaced by row2's column i. And if a 5 is in row2, column i, it's replaced by 0 (since there's no row below).\n\nBut let's check this hypothesis:\n\nIn Example0, row0's column1 has 5. So output row0's column1 would be row1's column1 value, which is 2. Then, what about the next elements in output row0? It's 2,1,1. Wait, perhaps the 5 in row0's column1 is replaced by row1's column1 (2) and then the next columns in row1 are considered. But row1's next columns after column1 are 0,5,1,0,5,2,2. So perhaps after replacing 5 with 2, the next elements in row1 are used to fill the output row0. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe when a 5 is present in a row, the elements from the row below are \"pulled up\" into the current row's output. For example, in row0's column1 (5), we take the elements from row1's column1, then column2, etc., but this is getting a bit unclear.\n\nAnother angle: Let's compare the lengths. The input rows are of varying lengths (e.g., 9, 9,9 in Example0; 11,11,11 in Example1). The output rows are shorter. For instance, in Example0, the input rows are 9 elements, output rows are 7,7,7. So the outputs have two fewer elements. How does that happen?\n\nLooking at Example0's input and output:\n\nInput row0: [0,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0] \u2192 output [0,2,1,1,0,0,0]\n\nThe input has 9 elements, output 7. So two elements are removed. But where?\n\nThe 5 is at position1. The output starts with 0,2, then 1,1. Maybe the 5 is replaced by the next two elements from row1. Let's see:\n\nIn row1, after position1 (which is 2), the next elements are 2,0,5,1,0,5,2,2. So perhaps the 5 in row0 is replaced by 2 (from row1's same column) and then 0 (row1's next column). But output has 2 followed by 1,1. Not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe when a 5 is found in a row, it's replaced by the sum of the same column in the row below and the row below that. For Example0's row0, column1: row1's column1 is2, row2's is0. Sum is 2. So output is 2. Then perhaps the next columns are merged or something.\n\nBut in the output, after 2, there are two 1s. Maybe those 1s come from row1's next columns. Let's check row1's columns3 and4. Column3 is5, column4 is1. So maybe those are added. But 5+1=6, but output has 1,1. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each 5 in a row is replaced by the values from the row below, starting at that column. For example, row0's column1 has 5. Replace it with row1's column1, which is2, then row1's column2 (0), and so on. But the output for row0 after 2 is 1,1. That doesn't match row1's columns2 and3 (0 and5).\n\nHmm. This is getting complicated. Let's think of another example.\n\nExample3's input:\n\nRow0: [0,1,5,0,0,0,0,0,2,2,0]\nRow1: [1,1,0,0,5,2,0,5,2,0,0]\nRow2: [0,0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nOutput3:\n\nRow0: [0,1,1,2,2,0,2,2]\nRow1: [1,1,0,0,2,2,2,0]\nRow2: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nLooking at row0's input: there's a 5 at position2. The output row0 starts with 0,1,1,2,... The input row0's position2 is5. So according to some pattern, that 5 is replaced by 1. Let's see row1's position2 is0, row2's is0. How does that become 1? Not clear.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps when a 5 is present in a row, the output for that row's position is replaced by the sum of the other rows' elements in that column. For Example3's row0, column2: sum of row1 and row2 is0+0=0. So output would be 0, but output is1. So that's not it.\n\nAlternatively, the 5 in row0's column2 is replaced by the sum of the elements in the same column from the other rows. Row1's column2 is0, row2's is0. Sum is0. But output row0's position2 is1. So that's not matching.\n\nAnother idea: Maybe the 5s are acting as markers to indicate that the following elements in the same row should be taken from lower rows. For example, a 5 in row0 at position i means that the next elements in the output row0 are taken from row1, starting at position i.\n\nBut in Example0, row0's 5 is at position1. Output row0's position1 is2 (from row1's position1), then positions2 and3 are1 and1. Looking at row1's positions2 and3: they are0 and5. So that doesn't match. But the output has 1 and1. Not sure.\n\nWait, maybe when a 5 is present in a row, the output takes the values from the row below, but shifted. For example, in Example0, row0's 5 at position1 is replaced by row1's values starting from position1. So row1 has [2,2,0,5,1,0,5,2,2]. So starting at position1: 2,0,5,1, etc. The output row0 has 0,2,1,1,0,0,0. The 2 comes from row1's position1. The 1s may come from row1's position4 (1) and maybe some other positions. But it's unclear.\n\nAnother approach: Let's look for patterns in how the output elements relate to the input columns.\n\nLooking at Example0's input columns:\n\nColumn0: 0,2,0 \u2192 output rows0-2: 0,2,0\nColumn1:5,2,0 \u2192 output rows0-2: 2,2,0 (since output row0's column1 is2, row1's column1 is2, row2's is0)\nColumn2:0,0,0 \u2192 output rows:1,0,0 (row0's column2 is1)\nWait, this doesn't fit. Because in output row0's column2 is1, but input columns for column2 are all zeros. So perhaps it's not column-wise processing.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by collapsing the three rows into a single layer, but again, the output has three rows.\n\nAlternatively, think of the output rows as being a \"compression\" of the input rows where 5s are replaced by the values from lower rows, and the rest are filled in.\n\nWait, let's take Example0's row0: [0,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]. The output is [0,2,1,1,0,0,0]. The 5 is replaced by 2 (from row1's same position), then 1 and1. Row1's next positions after column1 are 0,5,1, etc. So perhaps after replacing 5 with row1's value (2), we look at row1's next elements and take the next non-zero values. But row1's next element after position1 is0, then 5,1. So maybe after 2, the next non-zero is5 (position3), but 5 would again be replaced. But how does this result in 1,1?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps 5s in any row are replaced by the maximum value from the same column in the other rows. Let's check:\n\nIn Example0, row0 column1 has5. The other rows in column1 are2 (row1) and0 (row2). The max is2. So output row0's column1 is2. That fits. Then row1's column3 is5. Other rows in column3 are0 (row0) and0 (row2). Max is0. But output row1's column3 is1. So that doesn't fit. So this theory is incorrect.\n\nAnother idea: Perhaps each 5 in a row is replaced by the product of the elements from the other two rows in the same column. For Example0's row0 column1: 2 (row1) *0 (row2)=0. But output is2. No.\n\nAlternatively, 5s are replaced by the sum of the other two rows in the same column. For Example0 row0 column1: 2 +0=2. Output is2. That fits. Then row0's output column1 is2. Then why are there two 1s following it?\n\nIn Example0's output row0, after 2, we have 1,1. Maybe these are derived from the next columns where the same process occurs. Let's look at the next columns.\n\nColumn2 in input: row0 is0, row1 is0, row2 is0. So sum is0. But output row0's column2 is1. Doesn't fit.\n\nThis is getting frustrating. Let's look at another example.\n\nExample2's input:\n\nRow0: [0,0,0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,0]\nRow1: [2,2,2,0,5,8,8,0,0,0,0]\nRow2: [0,0,5,0,0,0,0,0,5,6,6]\n\nOutput2:\n\nRow0: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\nRow1: [2,2,2,0,0,8,6,6,6]\nRow2: [0,0,2,8,8,8,0,0,0]\n\nLooking at row2's input: it has 5s at columns2 and8. Output row2 is [0,0,2,8,8,8,0,0,0]. So the 5 at column2 is replaced by2. Let's see the other rows: row1's column2 is2, row0's is0. Sum is2, which could replace the 5. Then, the output row2's column2 is2. The next elements in output row2 are8,8,8. Row1's columns3-5 are0,5,8. But output row2's columns3-5 are8,8,8. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps when a 5 is present in a row, it's replaced by the value from the same column in the row above. For example, row2's column2 has5. So replace with row1's column2, which is2. That fits. Then row2's column8 has5. Replace with row1's column8, which is0. Output row2's column8 is0. But output row2 has8s in columns3-5. Where do those come from?\n\nWait, row1's column5 is8, column6 is8. Maybe in row2's input, after the 5 at column2, the 8s in row1 are being pulled into row2's output. But how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps when a 5 is in a row, the output for that column is the value from the row above. Then, subsequent columns are filled with the values from the row above, possibly.\n\nFor example, in row2's column2 (5), replace with row1's column2 (2). Then, the next columns in row1 (columns3-5) are0,5,8. But output row2's columns3-5 are8,8,8. That doesn't fit. Hmm.\n\nAnother observation: In Example0's output row0, after the 2 (from row1's column1), there are 1s. Row1's column4 is1. Maybe when a 5 is replaced, it also pulls in the next non-zero value from the row below. But this is vague.\n\nAlternative approach: Let's think of each 5 in the input as a \"hole\" through which elements from lower rows can bubble up. For example, any 5 in a row is replaced by the value from the row below, and that row below's value is then replaced by the row below that, and so on. If there's a 5 in the bottom row, it's replaced by 0.\n\nBut let's test this:\n\nExample0's input row0 has 5 at column1. Replace it with row1's column1 (2). Then, row1's column1 is now considered. If row1's column1 was 5, we would replace it with row2's column1 (0), but in this case, it's 2, so it stays. So output row0's column1 is2. Then, perhaps the next elements in the output are taken from the row below's next elements. So after replacing the 5 with 2, perhaps the next elements in row1's columns are used to fill the current row. But in row1, after column1, the elements are0,5,1, etc. How does that lead to 1,1?\n\nAlternatively, when a 5 is in row i, column j, we take the value from row i+1, column j, and also row i+1, column j+1, j+2, etc., until a certain condition is met. For example, replace 5 with the next few elements from the row below.\n\nIn Example0's row0, column1 is5. So take row1's elements starting at column1: [2,0,5,1,0,5,2,2]. Maybe take the first non-zero after 2. But the next element is0, then5. But output row0's next elements after 2 are1,1. Perhaps after taking 2 from row1's column1, then take the next non-zero values, which are5 and1. But those are 5 and1. How do they become 1,1?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps after replacing the 5 with the value from row below, any 5s in that row are also processed. So for row0's 5 in column1, we take row1's column1 (2). Then, row1's column3 is5, so we take row2's column3 (0). But this would be for row1's processing.\n\nThis is getting too convoluted. Let's try to find a different pattern.\n\nLooking at the output rows, sometimes they are shorter than the input. For example, Example0's output rows are 7 elements long, while the input is 9. So perhaps the transformation removes some elements. Maybe whenever a 5 is present in any of the rows in a column, that column is processed in a special way, possibly removed or merged.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is created by taking each column and, if there's a 5 in any row, then the column is transformed, else kept as is. But in Example0's output, the first column is [0,2,0], same as input. So that's not the case.\n\nAnother idea: Let's look for the positions of 5s in the input and see if they correspond to certain patterns in the output.\n\nIn Example0's input:\n\nRow0: 5 at position1.\n\nRow1: 5s at positions3 and6.\n\nRow2:5 at position4.\n\nOutput rows:\n\nRow0: [0,2,1,1,0,0,0]\n\nRow1: [2,2,0,1,2,2,2]\n\nRow2: all zeros.\n\nSo the output row0's elements after 2 are 1,1. Maybe these are from row1's 5 and1. For instance, row1's position3 is5 (input), which in output row1 becomes1. So perhaps when a 5 is present in row1, it's replaced by the value from row2. But in this case, row2's position3 is0. But output row1's position3 is1, not 0. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps when a 5 is present in row i, column j, the output for that position is the sum of the adjacent non-zero elements from the same column in other rows. But not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that each 5 in a row is replaced by the number of non-zero elements in the same column of the other rows. For example, in Example0's row0, column1, the other rows have 2 (row1) and 0 (row2). Non-zero count is 1. So replace 5 with 1. But output is2. Doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, the 5 is replaced by the sum of the elements in the same column from the other rows. For Example0's row0, column1:2 +0=2. Output is2. Then, for row1's column3:5 in row1, other rows are0 (row0) and0 (row2). Sum is0, but output row1's column3 is1. So that doesn't fit.\n\nThis is really challenging. Let's try to think of the output rows as being the result of a convolution or some kind of sliding window operation. For example, each element in the output is derived from a window of elements in the input rows. But I'm not sure.\n\nAnother angle: Looking at Example0's output row1, which is [2,2,0,1,2,2,2]. The input row1 is [2,2,0,5,1,0,5,2,2]. The 5s at positions3 and6 are replaced by1 and2, respectively. The output row1's position3 is1, which could be from row2's position3 (0) plus something. Not sure.\n\nWait, row1's position3 is5, and row2's position3 is0. Output row1's position3 is1. How does that happen? Perhaps it's counting the number of non-zero elements in the same column across all rows. But row0's position3 is0, row1's is5, row2's is0. So non-zero count is1. So replaced by1. That fits. Then in row1's position6 (5), same column: row0's position6 is0, row2's is0. Non-zero count is1 again. So replaced by1. But output row1's position6 is2. So that doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. This is perplexing.\n\nLet's look at Example1's output row2: [0,2,1,1,1,3,3,0,0]. The input row2 has 5s at positions1 and7. Let's see how those are replaced. Position1's output is2. Other rows in column1: row0 has0, row1 has2. So maybe the 5 is replaced by row1's column1 value (2). Position7's output is0. Other rows in column7: row0 has0, row1 has0. So replaced by0. Then the 1s in output row2's positions2-4: where do they come from? Input row2's columns2-4 are0,0,0. So output row2's 1s must be coming from other rows. Maybe the 5s in other columns influence this.\n\nAlternatively, after replacing the 5s in row2 with values from row1, the subsequent elements are taken from row1's next positions. For example, row2's position1 is5 \u2192 replaced by row1's position1 (2). Then, the next elements in row1 are0,0,0,0,3,3,3. So maybe those are used to fill in the output. But output row2's positions2-4 are1,1,1. Not matching.\n\nAnother idea: Perhaps the 5s are being replaced by the values of the same column from the row below, and then the row below's elements are shifted left. For example, if row0 has a 5 in column1, replace it with row1's column1 (2), then remove row1's column1 and shift the rest left. But this would affect the length, but it's not clear.\n\nAlternatively, when a 5 is present in a column, that column is merged with the next column. For example, in Example0's input, the columns containing 5s are merged with adjacent columns. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, think of each 5 as a marker to take the next element from the row below. For example, in row0's 5 at position1, take row1's position1 (2) and then row1's position2 (0) becomes part of row0's output. But output row0 has 2 followed by 1,1. Not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps each 5 is replaced by the sum of the two adjacent elements in the row below. For example, in row0's 5 at position1, look at row1's position0 and position2 (2 and0), sum is2. Then output row0's position1 is2. Then the next elements are taken from row1's position3 and4 (5 and1), sum 6. Doesn't match output's 1,1.\n\nAlternatively, the 5 is replaced by the minimum of the elements from the other rows in that column. For Example0's row0 column1: min(2,0)=0. But output is2. So no.\n\nThis is really challenging. Maybe I should look for a different pattern that isn't directly related to the 5s.\n\nAnother observation: In the outputs, the rows are shorter. Maybe the input is being processed by removing columns that contain a 5 in any row. Let's check Example0:\n\nInput columns:\n\nColumns0: 0,2,0 \u2192 no5 \u2192 kept. Output columns0:0,2,0.\n\nColumn1:5,2,0 \u2192 has5 in row0 \u2192 removed. So output would skip this column.\n\nBut output row0's second element is2, which is from column1. So this theory is incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, columns with a5 are merged with adjacent columns. But I'm not sure.\n\nLooking at Example0's output length is7, input is9. So two columns are removed. Maybe columns where all three rows have zeros are removed. But in Example0's input, columns after position4 are all zeros in row0. But output row0 has zeros in those positions. So that's not it.\n\nAnother idea: The output rows are the result of replacing each 5 with the value from the row below and then the row below's value is set to zero. For example, in row0's column1, replace 5 with row1's column1 (2), then row1's column1 becomes zero. But in the output, row1's column1 is still2. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, when a 5 is found in row i, column j, the output row i's j is replaced with row i+1's j, and row i+1's j is replaced with row i+2's j, and so on. For example:\n\nIn Example0's row0, column1 has5 \u2192 replaced with row1's column1 (2).\n\nRow1's column1 becomes row2's column1 (0).\n\nRow2's column1 becomes 0 (since there's no row3).\n\nSo output row0's column1 is2, row1's column1 is0, row2's column1 is0. But in the actual output, row1's column1 is still2. So this doesn't fit.\n\nI'm stuck. Let's try to think of another approach.\n\nLooking at Example0's output row1: [2,2,0,1,2,2,2]. The input row1 is [2,2,0,5,1,0,5,2,2]. The 5s are replaced by1 and2. Let's see:\n\nThe first 5 in input row1 is at position3. Output row1's position3 is1. What's in row2's position3? 0. So maybe 5 is replaced by row2's position3 (0), but output is1. So that doesn't fit. Alternatively, perhaps 5 is replaced by the value from the row above. For row1's position3, the row above (row0) has0. So replaced by0, but output is1. No.\n\nWait, maybe the 5 is replaced by the sum of the previous and next elements in the same row. For input row1's position3 (5), previous is0, next is1. Sum is0+1=1. Output is1. That fits. Then the next 5 in row1's position6 is replaced by previous (0) and next (2), sum 0+2=2. Output is2. That fits.\n\nIf this is the case, then the rule could be: Replace each 5 with the sum of the previous and next elements in the same row. But let's test this on other examples.\n\nExample1's input row0 has 5s at positions3 and5. Let's see:\n\nFor position3: previous elements are0 (position2), next is1 (position4). Sum 0+1=1. Output row0's position3 is0. So this doesn't fit.\n\nSo this theory is incorrect.\n\nAnother idea: Maybe each 5 is replaced by the sum of the elements in the same column from the other two rows. For Example0's row1, position3 (5):\n\nOther rows' column3: row0 is0, row2 is0. Sum is0. Output is1. Doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each 5 is replaced by the product of the elements from the other rows in the same column. For Example0's row0 column1: 2 (row1) *0 (row2) =0. Output is2. Doesn't fit.\n\nThis is really tough. Maybe I should look for a different kind of pattern, like the movement of certain numbers.\n\nLooking at Example0's output row0: [0,2,1,1,0,0,0]. The 2 and 1s could be coming from row1's elements. For instance, row1's elements are [2,2,0,5,1,0,5,2,2]. So 2,2,0,5,1... Output row0's elements after 0 are 2,1,1. Maybe the 5 in row0's column1 is replaced by the first two non-zero elements from row1, which are2 and1. But row1's next non-zero after position1 is2 (position0), then position1 is2, position3 is5, etc. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the 5 in row0's column1 is replaced by the first two elements from row1's column1 and column2. Row1's column1 is2, column2 is0. So output is2,0. But output has 2,1,1. Doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, after replacing 5 with 2 (from row1's column1), the next elements are taken from row1's next columns until a zero is encountered. So row1's column1 is2, column2 is0. So we take 2 and stop. But output has 2,1,1. Not matching.\n\nI'm not making progress here. Let's think about the problem differently. The outputs have varying lengths. Let's see:\n\nExample0 input: 9 elements per row, output:7.\n\nExample1 input:11 elements per row, output:9.\n\nExample2 input:11 elements per row, output:9.\n\nExample3 input:11 elements per row, output:8.\n\nTest input:11 elements per row.\n\nThe output lengths are 2 elements shorter for Example0, 2 shorter for Example1, 2 shorter for Example2, and 3 shorter for Example3. Wait, no:\n\nExample0 input length9, output7: difference 2.\n\nExample1 input11, output9: difference 2.\n\nExample2 input11, output9: difference 2.\n\nExample3 input11, output8: difference3.\n\nSo the pattern isn't consistent in Example3. Maybe the length reduction is based on the number of 5s. For example, each 5 in any row reduces the output length by one. But in Example0, there are four 5s (row0:1, row1:2, row2:1), but output length reduces by2. So that's not it.\n\nAnother observation: The output rows often have a lot of zeros, especially in the row corresponding to the input row with the most 5s. For example, in Example0's output, row2 is all zeros. The input row2 has a 5. In Example1's output, row0 is all zeros. The input row0 has two 5s. Example3's output row2 is all zeros. Input row2 has one 5. So maybe the output row corresponding to the input row with 5s is filled with zeros. But that's not the case. In Example2's output, row0 is all zeros, and the input row0 has one5. But other examples don't fit.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output rows are generated by merging adjacent elements when a 5 is present. For example, when a 5 is found, the next two elements are merged. But I'm not sure.\n\nAnother idea: Let's look for the presence of 5s in a column. Whenever there's a 5 in any row of a column, that column is modified in the output. For example, the column is replaced by the sum of the elements from the rows below. But again, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the output for a column is determined by the highest row in that column that contains a 5. For example, if a column has a5 in row0, then the output for that column is determined by row0's processing; if not, check row1, etc.\n\nBut I'm not seeing a clear pattern.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and lack of progress, perhaps I should look for a different angle. Let's consider that the output rows are formed by taking the input rows and replacing each 5 with the value from the row below, and then removing the 5s. But that doesn't explain the additional elements.\n\nAlternatively, when a 5 is present in a row, it's replaced by the value from the row below, and that row's corresponding element is removed. But this doesn't explain the example outputs.\n\nAnother thought: Maybe the 5s are acting as wildcards that copy values from lower rows into higher rows. For example, a5 in row0, column i copies the value from row1, column i into row0, and the value from row2, column i into row1. But how does this lead to the outputs?\n\nIn Example0's row0, column1 has5. So row0's column1 becomes row1's column1 (2), and row1's column1 becomes row2's column1 (0). The output row0's column1 is2, and row1's column1 is2 (original value, not changed). So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, when a5 is present in row0's column i, the values from row1 and row2's column i are added to row0's output, causing the output row0 to have more elements. But in Example0's output row0, there's an increase in elements after the 5 is processed (from 0 to 2, then 1,1). But this doesn't fit the input's structure.\n\nAt this point, I'm going to try to make an educated guess based on the examples. It seems that when a5 appears in a row, it's replaced by values from the row below, possibly propagating values upward. For example, in Example0's row0, the 5 is replaced by the value from row1's same column (2), and then perhaps subsequent values from row1 are pulled up. This might explain the 1,1 in row0's output. Looking at row1's elements after the 2 at column1: 0,5,1. Maybe after replacing the 5 with 2, the 5 in row1's column3 is replaced by row2's column3 (0), but in the output, row1's column3 is1. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each 5 is replaced by the value from the row below, and this process is repeated for any 5s that appear in the lower rows. For example, row0's 5 is replaced by row1's value (2). If row1's value is5, it would be replaced by row2's value, and so on. So this creates a chain. \n\nLet's apply this to Example0:\n\nRow0's 5 at column1 is replaced by row1's column1 (2). Row1's column3 and6 have5s. These are replaced by row2's column3 and6 (both0). So row1's output would be [2,2,0,0,1,0,0,2,2]. But the actual output for row1 is [2,2,0,1,2,2,2]. Not sure.\n\nAnother example: Example1's row0 has5s at columns3 and5. These are replaced by row1's columns3 and5 (0 and0). So row0's output would have 0 and0, but the actual output is all zeros. So that fits. Then, row1's output remains the same except for columns where there are5s. But row1 has no5s. So output row1 is the same as input row1 but shortened. But how?\n\nThe output row1 in Example1 is [2,2,0,0,0,0,3,3,3], which is shorter than the input row1. The input row1 has11 elements. Output has9. So two columns are removed. How?\n\nThis is all very confusing. Given that I'm stuck, I'll try to hypothesize based on the examples that when a5 is present in a row, it's replaced by the value from the row below, and this process continues for all 5s. Then, the output array is formed by concatenating the non-5 values and the replaced values, possibly leading to a shorter array. \n\nAlternatively, the output array is formed by collapsing sequences of zeros and 5s into a single zero or the replaced value. For example, sequences of zeros following a replaced 5 are condensed. \n\nBut without a clear pattern, I'll have to make an educated guess based on the examples provided.\n\nLooking at the test input:\n\nTest Input:\nRow0: [0,5,0,5,1,0,0,5,0,5,8]\nRow1: [2,2,0,0,1,0,5,3,0,0,8]\nRow2: [0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nApplying the pattern from the examples, especially Example0 where 5 in row0 is replaced by 2 and followed by 1,1, maybe each 5 in a row is replaced by the value from the row below and then some following elements.\n\nFor row0's 5s:\n\nColumns1:5 \u2192 row1's column1 is2 \u2192 replaced by2.\n\nColumns3:5 \u2192 row1's column3 is0 \u2192 replaced by0.\n\nColumn7:5 \u2192 row1's column7 is3 \u2192 replaced by3.\n\nColumn9:5 \u2192 row1's column9 is0 \u2192 replaced by0.\n\nThen, for row0's output, the 5s are replaced by 2,0,3,0. But how does this fit into the output array?\n\nBut looking at the training examples, after replacing 5s, the output array is shorter. For example, Example0's output row0 is shorter than the input. So perhaps the 5s are replaced and then the array is compressed by removing some elements. \n\nAlternatively, each 5 in a row is replaced by the values from the same column in the rows below, and then the array is shortened by removing the replaced 5s. \n\nBut this is all speculative. Given the time I've spent and the need to provide an answer, I'll try to construct the test output based on the following pattern observed in the examples:\n\n- For each 5 in row i, column j, replace it with the value from row i+1, column j.\n- If there's a 5 in row i+1, column j, then replace that with row i+2's column j.\n- Continue until a non-5 value is found.\n- Then, the output is formed by taking these replacements and possibly merging adjacent elements.\n\nApplying this to the test input:\n\nRow0: [0,5,0,5,1,0,0,5,0,5,8]\nRow1: [2,2,0,0,1,0,5,3,0,0,8]\nRow2: [0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nProcessing row0's 5s:\n\nColumn1:5 \u2192 row1's column1 is2. So replaced by2.\n\nColumn3:5 \u2192 row1's column3 is0.\n\nColumn7:5 \u2192 row1's column7 is3.\n\nColumn9:5 \u2192 row1's column9 is0.\n\nSo row0 becomes [0,2,0,0,1,0,0,3,0,0,8].\n\nBut the output rows are shorter. So maybe after replacement, adjacent elements are summed or merged. For example, consecutive zeros are removed. Or sequences with 5 replacements are merged.\n\nAlternatively, after replacing 5s, the array is shortened by removing the columns where all rows have zeros. But the test input has various non-zero values.\n\nLooking at Example0's output row0: [0,2,1,1,0,0,0]. The input row0 after replacement would be [0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0], but the output has additional 1,1. This suggests that there's more to the pattern than simple replacement.\n\nAnother possible pattern is that after replacing 5s, the values from the lower rows are propagated upwards, and the array is compressed by merging certain elements.\n\nGiven the time constraints, I'll proceed to make an educated guess for the test output based on the examples, particularly Example0 and Example1, where the 5s in row0 are replaced by values from row1, and the output rows are shortened.\n\nFor the test input:\n\nRow0: Replace 5s with row1's corresponding values:\n\nOriginal: 0,5,0,5,1,0,0,5,0,5,8 \u2192 replaced with 0,2,0,0,1,0,0,3,0,0,8.\n\nRow1: Replace 5s with row2's corresponding values:\n\nOriginal: 2,2,0,0,1,0,5,3,0,0,8 \u2192 replace column6 (5) with row2's column6 (0). So becomes 2,2,0,0,1,0,0,3,0,0,8.\n\nRow2: Since there's no row below, 5s are replaced by 0. Original row2 has a5 at column4 \u2192 replaced by0. So row2 becomes [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0].\n\nNow, the output rows need to be shorter. How?\n\nLooking at Example0, after replacement, the output rows are shorter. For example, in Example0, the input row0 was length9, output7. The difference is2. Maybe remove the last two elements. But in Example0's output row0, the last three elements are zeros. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, remove columns where all rows have zeros. For test input:\n\nAfter replacement, rows are:\n\nRow0: [0,2,0,0,1,0,0,3,0,0,8]\n\nRow1: [2,2,0,0,1,0,0,3,0,0,8]\n\nRow2: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nColumns where all are zeros: columns2,3,5,6,8,9. So removing these columns would leave columns0,1,4,7,10,11. But the output length would be 5, which doesn't match the training examples' pattern.\n\nAlternatively, merge consecutive zeros into a single zero. For example, in row0: [0,2,0,0,1,0,0,3,0,0,8] becomes [0,2,0,1,0,3,0,8]. But this is length8. Not sure.\n\nAnother approach from the examples: In Example0's output row0, after replacing the 5, there are additional elements (1,1) that aren't directly from row1's same column. This suggests that after replacing a5, subsequent elements may come from the row below's next columns. For example, replacing 5 in row0's column1 with row1's column1 (2), then taking row1's column2 (0) and column3 (5), but replacing the 5 in row1's column3 with row2's column3 (0). So row0's output becomes 0,2,0,0, etc. But this doesn't match the example's output.\n\nGiven that I'm unable to discern the exact pattern, I'll have to make a best guess. Looking at Example0's output row0: after the replaced 5, there are two 1s. These could correspond to the row1's column4 (1) and row2's column4 (5 \u2192 replaced by0). But how this leads to 1s is unclear.\n\nAlternatively, the output is created by replacing each 5 with the sum of the elements from the rows below, and then collapsing the array by removing zeros. But this is a stretch.\n\nGiven the time I've invested and the need to proceed, I'll hazard a guess that the output for the test input is:\n\nRow0: [0,2,0,0,1,3,0,0,8] \u2192 but need to match the example patterns. Alternatively, following the example where 5s are replaced by values from the row below and some elements are merged.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output rows are formed by taking the values from the row below where there's a 5, and then concatenating the non-5 values and the replaced values, leading to shorter rows. \n\nFor the test input:\n\nRow0: After replacing 5s with row1's values: [0,2,0,0,1,0,0,3,0,0,8]. Now, remove the 0s between non-zeros. But this would result in [0,2,1,3,8], which is shorter than expected.\n\nBut the output rows in the training examples don't follow this pattern. For example, Example0's output row0 has zeros after the 1s.\n\nGiven that I'm stuck, I'll try to mimic the structure of the training examples. For instance, in Example0's output, the 5 in row0 is replaced by 2, followed by 1,1. Maybe the 1s come from row1's next non-zero elements after the replacement. For the test input's row0:\n\nReplaced 5s are at columns1 (2),3 (0),7 (3),9 (0). So the row becomes [0,2,0,0,1,0,0,3,0,0,8]. Then, merging consecutive zeros: [0,2,0,1,0,3,0,8]. But length is8. Training example outputs have varying lengths, but the test input has 11 elements, so the output might be 9 elements.\n\nAlternatively, the output is formed by taking the replaced values and inserting some elements from lower rows. For example, after replacing a 5 with the value from row1, then taking the next element from row1 and adding it. For example, row0's column1 is replaced by2, then take row1's column2 (0), but how does this fit?\n\nGiven that I can't find the exact pattern, I'll proceed to guess based on the training examples' outputs, which often have the middle row (row1) retaining some structure and the other rows having more zeros. For the test input:\n\nRow0: [0,5,0,5,1,0,0,5,0,5,8]\n\nReplacing 5s with row1's values: [0,2,0,0,1,0,0,3,0,0,8]. Maybe this is compressed by removing zeros between non-zeros. But not sure. Alternatively, replace 5s and then take certain elements from row1 and row2. \n\nAlternatively, the output might look like:\n\nRow0: [0,2,0,0,1,3,0,0,8] but this is just a guess.\n\nRow1: After replacing 5 in column6 with row2's value (0), becomes [2,2,0,0,1,0,0,3,0,0,8]. Compressed by merging zeros. Maybe [2,2,0,0,1,0,3,0,8].\n\nRow2: All zeros.\n\nBut I'm not confident. Given that I need to provide an answer, I'll proceed with the following output, inspired by the training examples, especially Example0 and Example2:\n\nTest Output:\n\nRow0: [0,2,0,0,1,3,0,0,8]\n\nRow1: [2,2,0,0,1,0,3,3,8]\n\nRow2: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nBut this doesn't match the training examples' patterns. Another possible approach is to look for the number of 5s in each row and apply a certain transformation. For example, in the test input:\n\nRow0 has 4 5s.\n\nRow1 has 1 5.\n\nRow2 has 1 5.\n\nFollowing Example0's pattern where each 5 in row0 is replaced by values from row1, and row1's 5 is replaced by row2's value.\n\nRow0's output after replacement: [0,2,0,0,1,0,0,3,0,0,8]. Then, perhaps merging the replaced 5s with their neighbors, leading to shorter rows.\n\nBut without a clear pattern, I'll have to make a best guess based on the examples.\n\nBased on Example3's output, where input row0 has a5 that is replaced by 1 in the output, and the output row0 becomes shorter, I'll guess that the test output is:\n\nRow0: [0,2,0,0,1,3,0,0,8]\n\nRow1: [2,2,0,0,1,0,3,0,8]\n\nRow2: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nBut this is a stretch. Another possibility is that the output rows are shortened by removing the columns where all three rows have zeros. However, in the test input, after replacement, there might be columns with all zeros.\n\nBut I'm not certain. Given the time, I'll proceed to format the answer according to the examples, even if the pattern isn't entirely clear.",

        "cot_2": "Okay, let's see. I need to figure out the pattern that transforms the input lists into the output lists in the training examples. Then apply that to the test input. Let's start by looking at the examples one by one.\n\nLooking at Example 0:\n\nInput:\nThree rows:\n[0,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n[2,2,0,5,1,0,5,2,2]\n[0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,0]\n\nOutput:\nThree rows shorter:\n[0,2,1,1,0,0,0]\n[2,2,0,1,2,2,2]\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nHmm, the output rows are shorter than the input. Let me check the lengths. Input has 9 elements per row, output has 7. So each row is reduced by 2 elements? Or maybe some other way. Let's see the numbers.\n\nFirst input row starts with 0,5, then a bunch of zeros. The output row starts with 0,2,1,1. Maybe there's a transformation where 5s are replaced by something. Wait, looking at the output rows, perhaps each element in the output is derived from combining adjacent elements in the input. For example, maybe adding pairs or taking the maximum of adjacent elements. Let's check.\n\nTake the first input row of example 0: [0,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]. The output is [0,2,1,1,0,0,0]. Wait, how does 5 become 2? That doesn't make sense. Alternatively, maybe it's a sliding window of some sort. Let me check the second row.\n\nInput row 2 in example 0: [2,2,0,5,1,0,5,2,2]. Output is [2,2,0,1,2,2,2]. So maybe the output is generated by combining elements in groups, but perhaps with some operation. For instance, perhaps each output element is the sum of two adjacent elements in the input, but modulo some number. Let's see.\n\nTake the first input row of example 0. Let's see if combining two elements at a time:\n\n0+5=5, 0+0=0, 0+0=0, 0+0=0, 0+0=0. But the output starts with 0,2,1,1... That doesn't align. Alternatively, maybe taking the maximum of two adjacent elements. For the first input row, 0 and5, the max is 5. But the output starts with 0. Hmm, that doesn't fit. Maybe something else.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 5s are acting as markers, and the numbers between them are being transformed. Let's look for 5s in the input rows. For example, in example 0's first input row, there's a 5 at position 1. The output for that row starts with 0,2,1,1... Maybe when there's a 5, it's replaced by a certain value, and the surrounding numbers are adjusted.\n\nWait, let's compare the input and output rows more carefully. Let's take the second row of example 0:\n\nInput: [2,2,0,5,1,0,5,2,2]\nOutput: [2,2,0,1,2,2,2]\n\nLooking at the input, there are 5s at positions 3 and 6. In the output, between those positions in the input (positions 3 and 6), the elements in the output are 0,1,2,2. Maybe when there's a 5, it's replaced by some operation on the adjacent elements. For instance, the 5 in the input is between 0 and 1 (positions 3 and 4). Maybe the 5 is replaced by 0 and 1? But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 5s are acting as separators, and the output is formed by combining the numbers between the 5s. Let's see. In example 0's first input row: [0,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]. The 5 is at position 1. The output is [0,2,1,1,0,0,0]. Not sure. Alternatively, perhaps each 5 in the input is replaced by a 1, and the surrounding numbers are modified based on adjacent numbers.\n\nWait, maybe the output is formed by taking each triplet of elements in the input and combining them in some way. For example, for each group of three elements, output a single element. Let's check. The input rows in example 0 have 9 elements, which divided by 3 would be 3 elements. But the output has 7 elements. That doesn't fit. So maybe a different approach.\n\nLooking at example 1:\n\nInput:\n[0,0,0,5,1,5,0,0,0,0,0] (11 elements)\nOutput:\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0] (9 elements)\n\nSo input length 11, output 9. That's a reduction by 2. Similarly, example 0: input length 9 \u2192 output 7. Example 2: input 11 \u2192 output 9. Example 3: input 11 \u2192 output 8? Wait no, example 3's output is 8 elements. Wait, example 3 input is 11 elements per row (since each input row has 11?), output 8. So the pattern might be that the output is the input length minus 2. Wait example 0: 9\u21927 (9-2=7). Example1:11\u21929. Example2:11\u21929. Example3:11\u21928. Wait no, example3's output is 8 elements, so 11-3=8. Hmm, maybe that's not the case. Maybe the output length isn't a fixed difference. So perhaps the length isn't the key here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output rows are formed by processing the input rows in a way that removes certain elements, like the zeros. But in example 0's first input row, there are many zeros, but the output has some non-zero elements. So that's not it.\n\nAnother approach: look at how the numbers in the output relate to the input numbers. Let's take the second row of example0's input and output.\n\nInput row: [2,2,0,5,1,0,5,2,2]\nOutput: [2,2,0,1,2,2,2]\n\nIn the input, after the 5s (positions 3 and 6), perhaps the numbers are being summed or combined. Let's see:\n\nBetween the first 5 (position3) and the next 5 (position6), the elements are 1, 0. The output in that area is 1. Then after the second 5, the elements are 2,2. The output here is 2,2. But why?\n\nAlternatively, maybe each 5 in the input is replaced by the sum of the adjacent elements. For example, the first 5 (position3 in the input row) is between 0 and 1. 0+1=1. Then the next 5 (position6) is between 0 and 2. 0+2=2. So in the output, perhaps the 5s are replaced by the sum of their neighbors, and the rest of the elements are taken as is, but with the 5s removed. Let's see.\n\nIn example0's second row input: [2,2,0,5,1,0,5,2,2]\n\nIf we remove the 5s and replace them with the sum of their adjacent elements:\n\nAfter first 5 (between 0 and 1), replace 5 with 0+1=1. Then next 5 (between 0 and 2) \u2192 0+2=2. So the modified input would be [2,2,0,1,1,0,2,2,2]. Then maybe the output is taking this modified array and removing the elements after the first 5's replacement. Wait, but the output is shorter. Maybe after replacing the 5s with their adjacent sums, the array is compressed by merging certain elements.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps when a 5 is present, it's acting as a marker to combine the previous and next elements. For example, each 5 is replaced by the sum of the elements before and after, then the 5 and those elements are replaced by that sum. But how would that affect the array length?\n\nLet's try that. For example0's second input row:\n\nOriginal: [2,2,0,5,1,0,5,2,2]\n\nFirst 5 is at index3. The elements before and after are 0 (index2) and 1 (index4). Sum is 0+1=1. So replacing 5 and its neighbors with 1. Wait but then the array would become [2,2,1,0,5,2,2]. But that doesn't align with the output. Alternatively, maybe each 5 is replaced by the sum of the elements to the left and right, and the 5 is removed, but the adjacent elements are kept? Or perhaps the 5 is replaced by the sum, and the elements adjacent to the 5 are removed. Let's see.\n\nIf in example0's second row, replacing the first 5 (index3) with the sum of left (0) and right (1) gives 1. So the array becomes [2,2,0,1,0,5,2,2]. Then the next 5 is at index5. Sum of left (0) and right (2) is 2. So replacing that 5 with 2 gives [2,2,0,1,0,2,2,2]. But the output is [2,2,0,1,2,2,2]. Hmm, maybe after replacing each 5 with the sum of left and right, and then removing the elements adjacent to the 5. But in this case, the first 5 is at index3. If we replace the 5 with 0+1=1, and remove the 0 (index2) and 1 (index4), then the array would be [2,2,1,0,5,2,2], but that's not matching. Alternatively, maybe when a 5 is replaced, the elements before and after are also modified.\n\nThis is getting a bit complicated. Let's look for another pattern. Maybe the output rows are formed by adding adjacent elements where there's a 5 in the input. For example, whenever there's a 5 in a row, the elements before and after are summed. Let's check example0's first row:\n\nInput: [0,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nThe 5 is at index1. If we sum the elements before and after (0 and 0), we get 0. Then, maybe the output starts with 0, followed by the sum. But the output starts with 0,2,1,1... Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 5 acts as a splitter, and the numbers between 5s are summed or processed. For example, in example1's first input row: [0,0,0,5,1,5,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nThere's a 5 at index3 and 5. The elements between them are [1], which sum to 1. Then after the second 5, it's zeros. The output is all zeros. Not sure.\n\nAnother angle: looking at the output numbers, in example0's first output row, there's a 2 and 1s. Where do those come from? Let's look at the input rows. The first input row is [0,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]. The output is [0,2,1,1,0,0,0]. Maybe the 5 is replaced by 2, and the next elements are modified. But why 2?\n\nWait, perhaps the 5 in a row is replaced by the value from the row below. For example, in example0's first input row, the 5 is at position1. Looking at the same position in the row below (row2: [2,2,0,5,1,0,5,2,2]), the value is 2. So the 5 is replaced by 2. Then the next elements might be derived from the next row? Not sure. Let's check.\n\nIn example0's first input row, after the 5 at position1, the output becomes 2, then 1,1. Looking at the row below (row2), maybe the elements after position1 are 0,5,1,0,5, etc. Maybe each 5 is replaced by the sum of the elements below. But this is getting too vague.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each 5 in a row is replaced by the maximum value from the same column in the other rows. Let's take example0's first row, position1 (5). The other rows at column1 are row2 has 2, row3 has 0. Max is 2. So replace 5 with 2. Then the next 5 in row2 (position3) is replaced by max from row1 (0) and row3 (0) \u2192 0? But in row2's output, the 5 is replaced by 0, but in the output it's 0, then 1. Hmm, not sure.\n\nWait, let's look at example0's output first row: [0,2,1,1,0,0,0]. The input first row is [0,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]. So after 0, there's a 5 which becomes 2, then three 0s become 1,1, then the rest 0. How?\n\nLooking at the other rows. Row2 in input has [2,2,0,5,1,0,5,2,2]. Output row2 is [2,2,0,1,2,2,2]. So the 5s in row2 are replaced by 1 and 2. Maybe the 5s are replaced by the sum of the elements above and below. For row2, first 5 is at index3. Above (row1) is 0, below (row3) is 0. Sum is 0+0=0. But in the output, it's replaced by 0. But in row2's output, after that 0 comes 1. Hmm, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe when there's a 5 in a row, it's replaced by the sum of the elements to the left and right. For example, in row1 of example0, 5 is at index1. Left is 0, right is 0. Sum is 0, but the output has 2 there. That doesn't fit.\n\nAnother approach: look for how the output rows are constructed. Let's take example0's first output row: [0,2,1,1,0,0,0]. Let's compare to the input rows. Maybe each element in the output is a combination of elements from all three input rows in the same column. For example, sum vertically. But 0+2+0=2 for column0. But the first element in output row1 is 0. So that's not it.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output rows are the sum of the rows above and below. For example, output row0 is row0 + row2. In example0, row0 is [0,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0], row2 is [0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,0]. Sum would be [0,5,0,0,5,0,0,0,0]. But the output row0 is [0,2,1,1,0,0,0]. Doesn't align.\n\nHmm, this is tricky. Let me look at another example. Example1's input:\n\nRow0: [0,0,0,5,1,5,0,0,0,0,0]\nRow1: [2,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,3,3]\nRow2: [0,5,0,0,0,0,0,5,3,0,0]\n\nOutput rows:\n\nRow0: all zeros.\nRow1: [2,2,0,0,0,0,3,3,3]\nRow2: [0,2,1,1,1,3,3,0,0]\n\nLooking at output row2: starts with 0,2,1,1,1,3,3,0,0. How does that relate to input row2? Input row2 has 5s at positions1 and7. Maybe the 5s are replaced by values from other rows. For example, the first 5 in input row2 is at position1. Looking at row1's position1: 2. Row0's position1:0. So maybe 0+2=2. That's the 2 in the output row2's position1. Then, between the two 5s in row2 (positions1 and7), the elements in row2 are [0,0,0,0,0,0,5,3]. Maybe this is transformed into 1,1,1,3,3. Hmm. Perhaps when a 5 is present, the elements between them are summed or processed in some way.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output rows are constructed by collapsing the input rows by replacing 5s and their adjacent elements with certain values. For example, each 5 is replaced by 1, and the numbers before and after are summed. But I'm not seeing it.\n\nLet me try to find a pattern that works across all examples.\n\nLooking at example2:\n\nInput row1: [2,2,2,0,5,8,8,0,0,0,0]\nOutput row1: [2,2,2,0,0,8,6,6,6]\n\nIn the input row1, there's a 5 at position4. The output row1 has 0 at position4. The next elements in input are 8,8,0, etc. The output has 8,6,6,6. Maybe the 5 is replaced by 0, and then the following 8s are adjusted. How? Maybe the 5 and the next element (8) are replaced by 8-2=6? Or perhaps the 5 is followed by an 8, so 8 is replaced by 6. But why 6?\n\nAlternatively, the 5 in row1's input is between 0 and8. Sum 0+8=8, but the output has 0. Not sure.\n\nWait, looking at example2's output row2: [0,0,2,8,8,8,0,0,0]. Input row2: [0,0,5,0,0,0,0,0,5,6,6]. Maybe the 5s in row2 are replaced. The first 5 (position2) is replaced by 2. Then between the two 5s in input row2 (positions2 and8), we have 0,0,0,0,0,5. The output row2 becomes 2,8,8,8. So perhaps after replacing the 5s with certain values, the numbers in between are filled with a certain value. Like, the first 5 is replaced by 2, then the next elements are filled with 8 up to the next 5, which is replaced by 6. But this is speculative.\n\nAlternatively, maybe when a 5 appears in a row, the output takes the maximum value from the same column in other rows. For example, in example2's input row0: [0,0,0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,0]. The 5 is at position6. Looking at other rows in column6: row1 has 8, row2 has 0. So max is 8. But the output row0 is all zeros. Hmm, that doesn't fit.\n\nAnother angle: perhaps the output rows are the result of collapsing the input rows by merging consecutive zeros. For example, in example0's first row, after replacing 5 with 2, the zeros are merged into a single zero. But the output has multiple zeros.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern involves looking at the surrounding numbers of each 5 and transforming them. For instance, for each 5 in the input, subtract 3 from it and add 1 to the adjacent numbers. But in example0's first row, the 5 would become 2, and the zeros around it become 1. That fits with the output [0,2,1,1,0,...]. Let's test this.\n\nIn example0's first input row: [0,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]. Replace 5 with 5-3=2. Add 1 to left (0\u21921) and right (0\u21921). But the output is [0,2,1,1,0,0,0]. So the first 5 becomes 2, the left 0 becomes 1, and the right 0 becomes 1. Then, the rest remain as zeros. But the input after that is 0,0,0,... which in the output becomes 0,0,0. So yes, this fits.\n\nLet's check example0's second input row: [2,2,0,5,1,0,5,2,2]. The two 5s would be replaced by 2 each (5-3=2). For the first 5 at position3: left is 0, right is1. Add 1 to both \u2192 1 and 2. The second 5 at position6: left is0, right is2. Add 1 \u21921 and3. But let's see the output row2 is [2,2,0,1,2,2,2]. So after replacing the first 5 with 2, the left becomes 0+1=1 (original was 0, becomes 1?), but in the output after the 0, it's 1. Wait, maybe this pattern works. Let's see:\n\nOriginal input row2: [2,2,0,5,1,0,5,2,2]\n\nFirst 5 at position3. Replace 5 with 2 (5-3). Add 1 to left (0\u21921) and right (1\u21922). So the elements around position3 become 1 and 2. The row becomes [2,2,1,2,2,0,5,2,2]. Then the next 5 is at position6. Replace with 2 (5-3). Add 1 to left (0\u21921) and right (2\u21923). So the row becomes [2,2,1,2,2,1,2,3,2]. But the output row is [2,2,0,1,2,2,2]. Hmm, that doesn't match. So this approach may not work.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each 5 is replaced by the sum of the elements to the left and right. For example, the first 5 in example0's row2 has left 0 and right 1 \u2192 sum 1. So replace 5 with 1. The next 5 has left 0 and right 2 \u2192 sum 2. So the row would become [2,2,0,1,1,0,2,2,2]. Then the output is [2,2,0,1,2,2,2]. But how does this lead to the output? Maybe after replacing the 5s with their left+right sums, the array is shortened by removing the elements adjacent to the 5s. For example, when replacing a 5 with left and right sum, you remove the left and right elements, thus reducing the length by 2 per 5. Let's test this.\n\nOriginal row in example0's row2: [2,2,0,5,1,0,5,2,2] (length 9).\n\nFirst 5 is at index3. Left is 0 (index2), right is1 (index4). Replace 5 with 0+1=1. Remove the left and right elements (indices2 and4). So the array becomes [2,2, (0 removed),1, (1 removed),0,5,2,2]. Wait, that's [2,2,1,0,5,2,2]. But there's still a 5 in there. Then process that 5. Left is0 (index3), right is2 (index5). Sum is0+2=2. Replace 5 with 2, remove left and right. So array becomes [2,2,1,2,2]. But the output row is [2,2,0,1,2,2,2]. Doesn't match.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the process is that each 5 is replaced by the sum of left and right, and the 5 is removed, but the left and right stay. So example0's row2 would become [2,2,0,1,1,0,2,2,2]. Then the output is this array but shortened. Wait, but the output is [2,2,0,1,2,2,2]. So maybe after replacing the 5s, the array is truncated by removing trailing elements? Not sure.\n\nThis approach seems inconsistent. Let me think of another pattern.\n\nLooking at the outputs, sometimes there's a 1 where there were zeros in the input. For example, example0's first output row has 0,2,1,1,0,... where the input had zeros after the 5. Maybe the 5 in the input causes the following zeros to be replaced by 1s. But how many 1s?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 5s act as a sort of \"spreader\" where each 5 converts into a certain number of 1s. For example, in example0's first input row, the 5 is followed by six zeros, but the output has two 1s. Not sure.\n\nAnother idea: the output is formed by taking each 5 in the input and replacing it with the sum of the numbers in the same column from the other rows, then removing the 5. Let's test this with example0's first row:\n\nRow0 input: [0,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]. The 5 is at column1. The other rows in column1 are 2 (row1) and 0 (row2). Sum is 2+0=2. So replace 5 with 2. The output row0 becomes [0,2, ...]. Then the rest of the elements are zeros. So maybe the output row0 is [0,2, 0,0,0,0,0] but the actual output is [0,2,1,1,0,0,0]. Hmm, that doesn't fit. But maybe the numbers following the 5 are summed with other rows. For example, after replacing 5 with 2, the next elements in the input are 0,0,0, etc. Sum with the corresponding columns in other rows. Let's see:\n\nIn example0's input:\n\nRow0: [0,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow1: [2,2,0,5,1,0,5,2,2]\n\nRow2: [0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,0]\n\nFor column2: row0 is0, row1 is0, row2 is0. Sum is0. So output row0's element after 2 would be 0. But in the output, it's 1. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAnother approach: Maybe the output is derived by processing each row as follows: whenever a 5 is encountered, the next number (to the right) is added to the previous number (to the left), replacing the 5 and the next number. For example, in example0's row0 input: [0,5,0, ...]. So when 5 is encountered, the next number (0) is added to the previous (0), resulting in 0. Replace 5 and 0 with 0. But output starts with 0,2, so this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 5 is replaced by the previous number plus the next number. For example, in example0's row0, 5 is between 0 and 0. So replaced by 0+0=0. But output has 2 there. So that's not it.\n\nWait, maybe the 5 is replaced by the sum of the elements above and below. For example, in example0's row0, the 5 is at column1. The elements below are row1 column1 (2) and row2 column1 (0). Sum is 2. So replace 5 with 2. Then the output row0 starts with 0,2. Then the next elements? The input row0 after 5 is all zeros. But the output has 1,1,0,0,0. Where do the 1s come from?\n\nLooking at example0's row2 input: [0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,0]. The 5 is at column4. So in row0's column4, the input is 0. In row1, column4 is1. Sum is 0+1=1. So perhaps after the first 5 in row0, the next columns are replaced by the sum of the same column in row0 and row1.\n\nFor example, after replacing 5 with 2, the next elements in row0's output would be sum of row0's column2 (0) and row1's column2 (0) \u21920. But the output has 1. Doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the numbers following a 5 in a row are replaced by the sum of the numbers in the same column from the other two rows. For example, in row0 of example0, after the 5 at column1, the next columns are 0,0,0, etc. Summing row1 and row2 columns:\n\nColumn2: row1 is0, row2 is0 \u21920. Column3: row1 is5, row2 is0 \u21925. Column4: row1 is1, row2 is5 \u21926. But the output row0 after 2 is1,1. This doesn't match.\n\nThis is getting really frustrating. Let me try to find another way. Let's consider that the output rows are transformed by replacing 5s with certain values and possibly merging adjacent elements. For example, each 5 is replaced by a certain value, and then neighboring elements are combined in pairs.\n\nLooking at example0's output row0: [0,2,1,1,0,0,0]. Let's see the input row0's 5 is replaced by 2. Then the following zeros are transformed into 1,1. Maybe when a 5 is replaced, the following elements are each incremented by 1 until another 5 is encountered in another row. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider that the 5s in any row are replaced by the number of 5s in the same column across all rows. For example, in example0's row0, column1 has one 5. So replaced by 1. But the output is 2. So no.\n\nWait, example0's row0, column1: 5. The other rows in column1: row1 has 2, row2 has 0. So sum is 2+0=2. So replace 5 with 2. That fits. Then in row0's output, after the 2, the next elements are 1,1. Where do those come from?\n\nLooking at the next columns in row0's input: columns2 to 8 are all 0. So columns2: row0 0, row1 0, row2 0 \u2192 sum 0. But output is 1. Hmm. Maybe this isn't the right approach.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is derived by taking each element and adding the elements from the rows below. For example, row0's output is row0 + row1 + row2 elements, but modulo some number. Let's see:\n\nIn example0's row0, the 5 is at column1. row1 column1 is2, row2 is0. So 5+2+0=7 mod something. But output is 2. 7 mod5 is2. 5+2+0=7. 7 mod5=2. So maybe each element is the sum of the column elements mod5. Let's check:\n\nRow0 column0: 0 + 2 + 0 =2 mod5=2. But output row0 starts with0. So no.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each 5 is replaced by the sum of the elements in the same column from the other rows. For example, row0's 5 at column1: sum row1 and row2's column1: 2+0=2. So replaced by2. Then, the rest of the elements in row0's output are the sum of the same column from other rows. For example, column2: row0's input is0. Sum of row1 and row2's column2:0+0=0. But output row0's column2 is1. Doesn't fit.\n\nThis is getting me nowhere. Let's try to find a pattern that works for all examples. Let's take example1's output row2: [0,2,1,1,1,3,3,0,0]. Input row2 is [0,5,0,0,0,0,0,5,3,0,0]. The output has 2 and 3s. How?\n\nThe first 5 in input row2 is replaced by2. Maybe that's from row1's column1:2. The next 5 is replaced by3. Row1's column7:0. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps each 5 is replaced by the value from the row above. For example, input row2's first 5 is at column1. Row1's column1 is2. So replaced by2. The second 5 in row2 is at column7. Row1's column7 is0. But output row2's element after that is3. Doesn't fit.\n\nAnother idea: the output is formed by replacing each 5 in the input with the number of non-zero elements in the same column across all rows. For example, in example0's row0 column1 (5), the other rows have 2 and 0. Non-zero count is1 (only row1 has 2). So replace 5 with1. But output is2. Doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, the number of non-zero elements in the same column. In example0's column1: row0 is5 (non-zero?), row1 is2, row2 is0. So count is2. Replace 5 with2. That fits. Let's check other examples.\n\nExample1's input row2 has a 5 at column1. Other rows in column1: row0 is0, row1 is2. Non-zero count is1 (row1). So replace 5 with1. But output row2 starts with0,2. So that doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. Not matching.\n\nAnother approach: maybe the output is a kind of \"collapse\" where each 5 and the elements to its left and right are transformed into new values, reducing the length of the array each time a 5 is processed. For example, each occurrence of 5 leads to a reduction in the array length by two elements (the 5 and its neighbors), replaced by a single value. But in example0's first row, there's one 5, so the length would go from 9 to 7 (9-2=7), which matches. But how are the values determined?\n\nAlternatively, when a 5 is found, it is replaced by the sum of the elements to the left and right, and then those elements are removed. So for each 5, the array length reduces by two (since left and right are removed along with the 5). Let's try this.\n\nTake example0's first row: [0,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]. There's one 5. Left is0, right is0. Sum is0. So replace the triplet [0,5,0] with0. The new array becomes [0,0,0,0,0,0,0], but the output is [0,2,1,1,0,0,0]. Doesn't fit.\n\nBut wait, maybe the sum is left+right, but the 5 is replaced by that sum and the left and right are kept. So example0's first row would become [0,0+0=0,0,0,0,0,0,0]. That's still all zeros. Not matching.\n\nThis is really challenging. Let's try to look for a different pattern. Maybe the output rows are derived by processing each row individually, where for each row:\n\n- Any 5 in the row is replaced by a certain value.\n- Then, adjacent elements are merged if they are the same.\n\nFor example, in example0's row1 input: [2,2,0,5,1,0,5,2,2]. Replacing 5s with some value. Output is [2,2,0,1,2,2,2]. If the 5s are replaced by1 and 2. Maybe the first 5 is replaced by1 and the second by2. But why?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 5 is replaced by the minimum of the elements in the same column from the other rows. For example, in example0's row0 column1:5. Other rows' column1:2 and0. Min is0. But output is2. So no.\n\nAlternatively, the maximum:2. So replaced by2. Then example0's row0 output starts with0,2. Then the next elements are 1,1. Where do those come from? Maybe the next elements in the input row are zeros, but in other rows' columns, there are values. For example, column2: row0 is0, row1 is0, row2 is0. So sum is0. But output is1. Not sure.\n\nAt this point, I think I need to find a different approach. Let's look for the position of 5s in the input and how they affect the output.\n\nIn example0's input:\n\nRow0 has a 5 at position1.\nRow1 has 5s at positions3 and6.\nRow2 has a 5 at position4.\n\nOutputs:\n\nRow0: [0,2,1,1,0,0,0]\nRow1: [2,2,0,1,2,2,2]\nRow2: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nLooking at row0's output: after the 0 and2, there are two 1s. Perhaps each 5 in the same column in other rows contributes to this. For example, row1 has a5 in column3 and6, row2 has5 in column4. Maybe the 1s in row0's output come from the number of 5s in those columns. But I'm not sure.\n\nAnother observation: in example0's row0 output, after the initial 0 and2, there are two 1s followed by zeros. Maybe the 2 and 1s are derived from the 5s in row1 and row2. For instance, the 5 in row1's position3 and6 could be influencing the output of row0.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output for each row is created by taking the sum of the row below and above. For example, row0's output is row1's input plus row2's input, but that doesn't seem to fit.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is generated by scanning each row and replacing 5s with the value from the row below, then processing the remaining elements. For example, in example0's row0 input: the 5 is at position1. The row below (row1) position1 is2. So replace with2. Then the rest of the elements in row0 are processed by taking the sum of the element and the one below. So row0's position2 is0 (row0) and0 (row1). Sum 0. But output row0's position2 is1. Doesn't fit.\n\nThis is really challenging. Let's try to find a common thread in all examples.\n\nAnother approach: look at the output rows and see if they resemble parts of the input rows. For example, in example0's output row1: [2,2,0,1,2,2,2]. The input row1 is [2,2,0,5,1,0,5,2,2]. So the output seems to replace the 5s with1 and2. The first 5 is replaced by1, the second by2. How could that happen?\n\nThe first 5 in row1 is at position3. The element below it (row2, position3) is0. The element above (row0, position3) is0. So 0+0=0. But replaced by1. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the first 5 is followed by1 (position4). Maybe the 5 and1 are replaced by1. So the sequence [5,1] becomes1. Then the next 5 is replaced by2. So the row becomes [2,2,0,1,0,2,2]. But the output is [2,2,0,1,2,2,2]. Maybe after that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 5s are replaced by the next number in the row. So the first 5 in row1 is followed by1, so replaced by1. The next 5 is followed by2, so replaced by2. Then the output is [2,2,0,1,0,2,2]. But the actual output has [2,2,0,1,2,2,2]. The 0 after the1 is replaced by2. Not sure why.\n\nAnother idea: the output is formed by collapsing the input rows by merging elements between 5s. For example, between two 5s, take the sum or some other operation. In example1's input row0: [0,0,0,5,1,5,0,0,0,0,0]. The 5s are at positions3 and5. Between them is1. So the output is all zeros. Maybe the sum is1, but replaced by0. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the numbers between 5s are summed and the result is divided by some number. But example1's output row0 is all zeros. So between 5s, the sum is1, but output is0. Maybe taking modulo something. But this is unclear.\n\nAt this point, I'm stuck. Maybe I should look for a different pattern. Let's consider the possibility that the output rows are constructed by taking the input rows and applying a convolution or moving window that combines elements.\n\nFor example, a window of size 3, and each output element is the sum of the window. But in example0's input row0:\n\n[0,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nSliding window of 3 elements with stride 1 would give sums:\n\n0+5+0=5, 5+0+0=5, 0+0+0=0, etc. But the output is shorter than the input, so maybe a window with stride 2. Alternatively, overlapping windows but aggregated differently.\n\nAlternatively, each output element is the sum of two adjacent elements. For example, in example0's input row0, the output would be:\n\n0+5=5, 0+0=0, 0+0=0, etc. But the output starts with 0,2,1,1... So no.\n\nAlternatively, the output elements are the sum of three consecutive elements. For example, in example0's input row0:\n\n0+5+0=5 \u2192 but output starts with0. Not matching.\n\nMaybe the output is formed by taking the sum of each pair of elements and then subtracting 3. Let's see:\n\nIn example0's row0, the first pair is0+5=5-3=2. Then next pair0+0=0-3=-3, which doesn't make sense. But output starts with0,2. So maybe the first element is taken as is, then pairs are summed with subtract 3. But this is not leading anywhere.\n\nAnother possible pattern: the output rows are the result of adding each element to the one two positions ahead. For example, in example0's row0 input: 0,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0. So 0+0=0 (positions0 and2), 5+0=5 (1 and3), etc. But the output is shorter, so maybe this is how it's done. But the output doesn't seem to fit.\n\nGiven that I'm stuck, perhaps I should look for patterns in the numbers themselves. For example, in example0's output row1: [2,2,0,1,2,2,2]. The input row1 has two 5s. The output has 1 and 2 between the 2s. Maybe the 5s are replaced by the sum of the previous and next elements. For instance, first 5 in row1 (position3) has previous0 and next1. Sum is1. So replace 5 with1. The next 5 (position6) has previous0 and next2. Sum is2. So replace 5 with2. So the input row1 becomes [2,2,0,1,1,0,2,2,2]. Then the output is [2,2,0,1,2,2,2]. How? Maybe after replacing the 5s, the array is shortened by removing the elements that were next to the 5s. For example, after replacing the first 5 with1, the next element (1) is kept, and the previous element (0) is also kept. But then the array is the same length. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, when a 5 is replaced by the sum of its neighbors, the 5 and the neighbors are removed, reducing the array length by 3 elements and adding one. So for each 5, the array length reduces by 2 (since 3 elements are replaced by 1). Let's try this.\n\nIn example0's row0 input: [0,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]. The 5 is at position1. Left is0, right is0. Sum is0. Replace the triplet [0,5,0] with0. The array becomes [0,0,0,0,0,0,0]. But the output is [0,2,1,1,0,0,0]. So this doesn't fit.\n\nBut if the 5 is replaced by the sum of left and right plus 2, then 0+0+2=2. So the triplet becomes2. The array becomes [0,2,0,0,0,0,0], which is shorter. But the output is longer.\n\nI'm really stuck here. Let me try to see if there's a pattern based on the test input.\n\nTest input:\n\nRow0: [0,5,0,5,1,0,0,5,0,5,8]\nRow1: [2,2,0,0,1,0,5,3,0,0,8]\nRow2: [0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nApplying the pattern from the training examples, what would the output look like?\n\nLooking at example0's output where row0 had a 5 replaced by 2, maybe in the test input, the 5s in row0 would be replaced by the sum of the elements from the other rows in the same column.\n\nFor example, row0's first 5 is at column1. Other rows column1: row1 is2, row2 is0. Sum is2+0=2. So replace with2.\n\nNext 5 in row0 is at column3. Other rows column3: row1 is0, row2 is0. Sum0. Replace with0.\n\nNext 5 at column7: row1 column7 is3, row2 is0. Sum3. Replace with3.\n\nNext 5 at column9: row1 column9 is0, row2 is0. Sum0. Replace with0.\n\nSo row0's output would be [0,2,0,0,1, ...] but need to see how the other elements are transformed.\n\nBut this is just a guess. The test input's output might look like:\n\nRow0: [0,2,0,3, ...] but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, if each 5 is replaced by the sum of its left and right neighbors, then in row0's first 5 (position1), left is0 and right is0. Sum0. So replace with0. Next 5 at position3: left is0, right is1. Sum1. Next 5 at position7: left is0, right is0. Sum0. Next 5 at position9: left is0, right is8. Sum8.\n\nSo row0 becomes [0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,8,8]. But this is not matching the output style of the training examples.\n\nGiven that I'm unable to find a clear pattern, perhaps I should look for a different approach. Maybe the output is created by taking each row and replacing every 5 with the value from the row below it. For example, in example0's row0, the 5 is replaced by row1's value at that position (2), which matches the output.\n\nThen, the output for row0 is formed by replacing all 5s with the value from the row below and then truncating the array by removing certain elements.\n\nLet's check this:\n\nExample0's row0 input has 5 at position1. Row1's position1 is2. So replaced by2. The output row0 starts with0,2. The rest of the elements in row0's input are zeros. So the output row0 would be [0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0], but the actual output is shorter and has 1s. So this isn't matching.\n\nAnother possibility is that the output rows are the result of replacing each 5 in the input with the value from the same column in the next row. For example, row0's 5 is replaced by row1's value, row1's 5s are replaced by row2's values, and row2's 5s are replaced by row0's values.\n\nExample0's row0 5 at position1: row1's value is2. So replaced by2. Row1's 5s at positions3 and6: row2's values are0 and0. So replaced by0 and0. Row2's 5 at position4: row0's value is0. So replaced by0. Then, the output rows would be:\n\nRow0: [0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0] \u2192 shortened to 7 elements: [0,2,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow1: [2,2,0,0,1,0,0,2,2] \u2192 shortened to7 elements: [2,2,0,0,1,0,0]\n\nBut the actual output for example0's rows are different. So this is not correct.\n\nGiven that I'm struggling to find the pattern, perhaps I should consider that the output is generated by a combination of replacing 5s and merging adjacent elements. For instance, each 5 is replaced by a certain value, and consecutive elements are merged by adding them if they are the same. For example, in example0's row1, the input is [2,2,0,5,1,0,5,2,2]. Replacing 5s with 1 and 2, then merging consecutive 2s: [2,2,0,1,2,2,2]. Which matches the output. So the pattern could be:\n\n- For each row, replace 5s with a value (maybe from the row below or some other rule).\n- Merge consecutive identical numbers by summing them or keeping them as is.\n\nBut how to determine the replacement value for 5s?\n\nIn example0's row1, the 5s are replaced by1 and2. Let's check the rows below. The first 5 is at position3 in row1. Row2's position3 is0. Row0's position3 is0. Sum is0+0=0. But replaced by1. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the value is taken from the next row. Row1's first 5 is at position3. Row2's position3 is0. So replaced by0. But output has1. Doesn't fit.\n\nThis is really challenging. Given the time I've spent without success, I'll try to make an educated guess based on the test input and the examples.\n\nLooking at the test input:\n\nRow0: [0,5,0,5,1,0,0,5,0,5,8]\nRow1: [2,2,0,0,1,0,5,3,0,0,8]\nRow2: [0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nIf I follow the pattern from example0 where 5s are replaced by the sum of the same column from the other rows:\n\nRow0's 5s:\n\n- Column1: row1 is2, row2 is0 \u21922+0=2.\n- Column3: row1 is0, row2 is0 \u21920.\n- Column7: row1 is3, row2 is0 \u21923.\n- Column9: row1 is0, row2 is0 \u21920.\n\nSo row0 becomes [0,2,0,0,1,0,0,3,0,0,8]. But the output should be shorter. Maybe after replacing 5s, some elements are merged or truncated.\n\nBut according to example0's output, the output rows are shorter by 2 elements. So input length 11 \u2192 output length 9.\n\nSo for row0's output, after replacing 5s with 2,0,3,0, the array becomes:\n\n[0,2,0,0,1,0,0,3,0,0,8] \u2192 length11. Maybe truncate the last two elements \u2192 [0,2,0,0,1,0,0,3,0]. But this doesn't match the training examples' patterns.\n\nAlternatively, after replacing 5s, remove the elements after each 5's replacement. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the output rows are formed by removing the 5s and their adjacent elements. For each 5, remove it and the elements to the left and right. So for row0's input:\n\n[0,5,0,5,1,0,0,5,0,5,8]\n\nEach 5 is at positions1,3,7,9.\n\nFor position1: remove elements0 (pos0),5 (pos1),0 (pos2). Then positions3 becomes new position1. But this would drastically reduce the array length. Not sure.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and not finding a clear pattern, I'll have to make a guess based on the examples. Looking at the outputs, it seems that whenever there's a 5 in a row, it's replaced by a value from another row, and the subsequent elements are filled with 1s or other numbers. For example, in example0's row0, the 5 is replaced by 2 (from row1's same column), and the next elements become 1s. In example1's row2, the 5s are replaced by 2 and3.\n\nApplying this to the test input's row0:\n\n5s are at columns1,3,7,9.\n\nFor column1: row1 has 2, row2 has0 \u2192 replace with2.\n\nColumn3: row1 has0, row2 has0 \u2192 replace with0.\n\nColumn7: row1 has3, row2 has0 \u2192 replace with3.\n\nColumn9: row1 has0, row2 has0 \u2192 replace with0.\n\nSo row0 becomes [0,2,0,0,1,0,0,3,0,0,8] \u2192 then, perhaps the elements after each replacement are filled with 1s up to the next 5 replacement. But I'm not sure.\n\nThe output might look like:\n\n[0,2,0,0,1,0,3,0,0,8] but I'm not confident.\n\nAlternatively, after replacing each 5, the following zeros are replaced by 1s. For example, in row0 of test input:\n\nAfter replacing 5s with2,0,3,0, the zeros after each replacement become 1s. So:\n\n[0,2,1,0,1,0,0,3,1,0,8]. Then, perhaps merge consecutive ones. But again, this is a guess.\n\nGiven that I'm not able to find a clear pattern, I'll have to make a best guess based on the examples. Looking at the training examples, it seems that when there's a 5, the output replaces it with a value from another row, and the surrounding elements are adjusted with 1s and other numbers.\n\nFor the test input, my best guess is:\n\nRow0: [0,2,0,0,1,0,3,0,0,8] \u2192 but the output length should be 9 (from 11 elements). So perhaps:\n\nRow0: [0,2,0,0,1,0,3,0,8]\n\nRow1: [2,2,0,0,1,0,3,0,8]\n\nRow2: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nBut this is a guess. Alternatively, looking at example3's input and output:\n\nInput row0: [0,1,5,0,0,0,0,0,2,2,0]\n\nOutput row0: [0,1,1,2,2,0,2,2]\n\nNotice that the 5 is replaced by1, and the following zeros become 2,2.\n\nMaybe the 5 is replaced by the sum of the elements from the other rows in that column. In example3's row0 column2:5. Row1 column2:0, row2 column2:0. Sum0. So replaced by0. But output has1. So this doesn't fit.\n\nGiven the time I've spent without progress, I'll have to provide an answer based on the most plausible pattern I can think of."
