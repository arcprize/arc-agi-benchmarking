        "cot_1": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. So, the input is a list of lists (3x3 matrices), and the output is another 3x3 matrix. Let's look at the training examples to find the transformation rule.\n\nStarting with Example 0:\nInput:\n[2,2,2]\n[3,2,3]\n[3,3,3]\nOutput:\n[5,0,0]\n[0,5,0]\n[0,0,5]\nHmm. The output has 5s in positions where maybe the input rows are unique or something. Let's check each row. The first input row is all 2s, then in the output it's [5,0,0]. The second input row is [3,2,3], which maybe becomes [0,5,0], and the third row [3,3,3] becomes [0,0,5]. Wait, but how does that happen?\n\nWait, maybe each output row corresponds to a row in the input, but modified based on some condition. Looking at the output rows, each has a single 5 and the rest 0s. The positions of the 5s are different for each row. In Example 0, the first output row's 5 is at index 0, the second at index 1, third at index 2. So maybe each row in the output has a 5 in a position that's determined by the input's rows.\n\nLooking at Example 1:\nInput:\n[3,3,3]\n[4,2,2]\n[4,4,2]\nOutput:\n[0,0,5]\n[0,5,0]\n[5,0,0]\nHere, the output rows have 5s in positions 2, 1, 0. How does that relate to the input rows?\n\nWait, maybe the rows are being ordered based on some criteria, and the 5s indicate their original position? Or maybe each row is transformed based on being the maximum in a certain way.\n\nAnother approach: Maybe the output matrix is a diagonal matrix where the 5s are placed based on the rows' uniqueness or their order when sorted.\n\nLooking at Example 2 and 3, where all input rows are the same. Their outputs have the first row as all 5s and the rest as 0s. Wait, no. Example 2's input is all 4s. Output is [5,5,5] in the first row, others 0. Example 3 is all 3s, same output structure. So if all rows are identical, the first row in output is all 5s, others 0. But in Example 4, where the input has two rows of 4s and one of 3s, the output is similar to Example 0, with 5s along the diagonal. Wait, but in Example 4, the input is:\n[4,4,4]\n[4,4,4]\n[3,3,3]\nOutput is:\n[5,0,0]\n[0,5,0]\n[0,0,5]\nSo the third row is [3,3,3], which in the output becomes [0,0,5]. So maybe when rows are in a certain order, each row's position determines where the 5 is placed.\n\nWait, perhaps the output is created such that each row's 5 is placed in the position corresponding to the row's rank when all the rows are sorted. Let's think.\n\nTake Example 0:\nInput rows:\n[2,2,2], [3,2,3], [3,3,3]\nIf we sort these rows in ascending order, maybe. Let's see: The first row is all 2s, the second is [3,2,3], which when sorted (as a row) would be [2,3,3]. Wait, but how are the rows being compared? Maybe each row is considered as a whole, and sorted based on their elements.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rows are sorted in a specific order (like descending or ascending), and each row in the output gets a 5 in the position corresponding to its original index in the sorted list.\n\nWait, in Example 0's input:\nOriginal rows (indexes 0,1,2):\nRow0: [2,2,2]\nRow1: [3,2,3]\nRow2: [3,3,3]\nIf we sort the rows in ascending order based on their elements lexicographically, then the order would be row0 (all 2s), row1 (3,2,3), row2 (all 3s). So when sorted, row0 is first (original index 0), row1 is next (original index1), row2 is third (original index2). Then, the output rows have 5s in positions 0,1,2 respectively. So the sorted order's indices determine where the 5 is placed in each original row.\n\nWait, but in the output of Example0, the first output row is [5,0,0], which would correspond to the first original row (row0) being the first in the sorted list, so its 5 is in position 0. The second original row (row1) is second in the sorted list, so its output row has a 5 in position1. The third row (row2) is third, so 5 in position2.\n\nThat seems to fit. Let's check Example1.\n\nExample1 input:\n[3,3,3]\n[4,2,2]\n[4,4,2]\nOriginal rows are row0, row1, row2.\n\nSorting these rows in ascending order lexicographically:\n\nRow0: [3,3,3]\nRow1: [4,2,2] \u2192 compared to row2: [4,4,2]. Let's see. Comparing row1 and row2: first element is 4 in both. Next element row1 has 2 vs row2's 4. So row1 comes before row2. So sorted order would be row0, row1, row2.\n\nOriginal indexes are 0,1,2. So sorted order is row0 (0), row1 (1), row2 (2). Then the output should have 5s in positions 0,1,2. But the actual output is:\n\n[0,0,5]\n[0,5,0]\n[5,0,0]\n\nWait, that doesn't match. So maybe the sorted order is different here. Let's see.\n\nWait, the input rows are:\n\nRow0: [3,3,3]\nRow1: [4,2,2]\nRow2: [4,4,2]\n\nComparing row1 and row2: first elements are 4. Then row1 has 2, row2 has4. So row1's second element is 2, which is less than row2's 4. So row1 comes before row2. So sorted order is row0, row1, row2. Then according to the previous pattern, output rows would have 5s in positions 0,1,2. But the output is:\n\nFirst output row: [0,0,5] \u2192 5 at position 2.\nSecond: [0,5,0] \u2192 position1.\nThird: [5,0,0] \u2192 position0.\n\nThat's the reverse. So in this case, sorted order might be descending. Let's check that.\n\nIf we sort the rows in descending order lexicographically, then the order would be row2, row1, row0. Let's see:\n\nRow2: [4,4,2]\nRow1: [4,2,2]\nRow0: [3,3,3]\n\nComparing row2 and row1: first element 4. Then row2's second element is 4, row1's is 2. So row2 comes after row1. So in descending order, the sorted rows would be row2, row1, row0. So the sorted indices are original row2 (index2), row1 (index1), row0 (index0). Then, each original row's position in the sorted list would determine where the 5 is placed. For example, original row0 (which is third in the sorted list) would have a 5 in position2 (since sorted list indices are 0: row2, 1: row1, 2: row0). Original row1 is in position1, so 5 in position1. Original row2 is in position0, so 5 in position0. But looking at Example1's output:\n\nOriginal row0's output is [0,0,5] (position2)\nOriginal row1's output is [0,5,0] (position1)\nOriginal row2's output is [5,0,0] (position0)\n\nThis matches exactly. So the pattern seems to be: sort the rows in descending order lexicographically. Then, for each original row, in the sorted list, note its position (0,1,2), and in the output matrix, place a 5 in the column corresponding to that position. So if the original row is in position 2 of the sorted list, its output row will have a 5 in column2. The rest are zeros.\n\nLet me check this with other examples.\n\nTake Example4:\n\nInput:\n[4,4,4]\n[4,4,4]\n[3,3,3]\nSorted in descending order: row0 and row1 (both [4,4,4]) are the same, then row2. So how are rows with same elements ordered? Maybe they are considered equal and their original order is preserved? Wait, when sorted, if two rows are equal, their original order might affect the sort. For example, in Python, when you sort lists that are equal, their original order is preserved (stable sort). But in lexicographical sorting, if two rows are identical, they are considered equal and their order may not matter. So in Example4, the input rows are:\n\nRow0: [4,4,4]\nRow1: [4,4,4]\nRow2: [3,3,3]\n\nSorted in descending order would be row0, row1, row2. So their positions are 0 (row0), 1 (row1), 2 (row2). Therefore, their output rows would have 5 in column0, column1, and column2 respectively. But the actual output for Example4 is:\n\n[5,0,0]\n[0,5,0]\n[0,0,5]\n\nWhich matches this. So original row0 (sorted position0) \u2192 5 in column0. Row1 (sorted position1) \u21925 in column1. Row2 (position2) \u21925 in column2. Correct.\n\nAnother example: Example2, where all rows are [4,4,4]. So when sorted in descending order, all are the same. How is the order determined? If all are equal, then their positions in the sorted list would be the same as their original indices? Or maybe when sorted, all are considered equal, so their positions are in their original order. Then, in this case, all three rows are same. So when sorted, they are all first? Or perhaps in the sorted list, their order is preserved. So in Example2, output is:\n\n[5,5,5]\n[0,0,0]\n[0,0,0]\n\nHmm. Wait, in Example2's output, the first row has all 5s. So according to the previous pattern, each original row's position in the sorted list would be 0,0,0 (since all are same and sorted first). So each original row's output would have 5 in column0. But the first output row is [5,5,5], which suggests that for each element in the first row of the input, the 5s are placed in all positions. That doesn't fit the previous pattern. Wait, maybe I'm missing something here.\n\nWait, let's look at Example2 and 3. Example2's input is three rows of [4,4,4]. The output is first row [5,5,5], others 0. Example3's input is all [3,3,3], output is same as Example2. So when all rows are the same, the output's first row has all 5s, and the rest are zeros. So maybe in this case, since all rows are equal, they are considered as part of the same group, and the first row in the output gets all 5s, and others zero. But that's conflicting with the previous pattern.\n\nWait, maybe there's a different rule. Let's re-examine.\n\nAlternative approach: For each row in the output, the position of the 5 depends on the rank of the input row. If the input row is the k-th largest (when sorted in descending order), then the output row has a 5 in the (k-1) position. But when there are duplicates in the sorted list, how is the rank determined?\n\nIn Example2, all rows are same. So they are all considered the first rank. Then, perhaps each of their output rows would have a 5 in position0, but in the output of Example2, the first row is [5,5,5]. That's not matching. Alternatively, when multiple rows have the same rank, perhaps they all contribute to their own position. Wait, perhaps the output is a permutation matrix where each row is a one-hot vector indicating their index in the sorted list. But when there are duplicate rows, their sorted positions would be the same. Hmm, but how does that lead to all 5s in the first row?\n\nWait, maybe the output rows are such that for each column, if that column's position in the sorted list corresponds to the original row's index, then the 5 is placed. But when all rows are same, they are all considered first, so in the first column of each output row. But in Example2's output, the first row has all 5s, which would mean each column is 5. That doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is created by checking for each row if it is the maximum in its column. But that's not the case in the examples.\n\nLet me try another angle. Let's look at the sum of each row. In Example0's output rows, each has sum 5. Similarly for other examples. So the total sum per row is 5. The output rows are such that each has exactly one 5 (or multiple in the case of Example2 and 3). But Example2's first row sums to 15 (5+5+5), others sum to 0. So that's different.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each row in the input is being compared to other rows, and the output is the count of something. But I can't see a direct relation.\n\nWait, looking at Example4's input:\n\n[4,4,4]\n[4,4,4]\n[3,3,3]\n\nOutput:\n\n[5,0,0]\n[0,5,0]\n[0,0,5]\n\nSo the first two input rows are the same. But their output rows have 5s in different positions. So that's conflicting with the previous thought that same rows would have same positions. Unless the sorting is done in a way that same rows are ordered by their original positions.\n\nIn Example4's input, when sorted in descending order, the first two rows are the same. So their order is preserved. So sorted list would be row0, row1, row2. So their positions are 0,1,2. Hence, their 5s are in columns 0,1,2. Which matches the output.\n\nSo the rule is: sort all rows in descending order lexicographically. For rows that are identical, their original order is preserved. Then, for each original row, find its index in the sorted list, and in the output row, set the element at that index to 5, others to 0. Except when all rows are the same. Wait, but in Example2 and 3, all rows are the same. So when sorted, they are in their original order (row0, row1, row2). Therefore, the output should have:\n\nrow0's output: 5 at index0 \u2192 [5,0,0]\nrow1: 5 at index1 \u2192 [0,5,0]\nrow2: 5 at index2 \u2192 [0,0,5]\n\nBut the actual output for Example2 is:\n\n[5,5,5]\n[0,0,0]\n[0,0,0]\n\nWhich is different. So there's an exception when all rows are the same. In that case, the first output row is all 5s, others zeros. So the pattern must have a condition: if all rows are identical, then the first output row is all 5s, others zero. Otherwise, proceed with the sorted indices.\n\nBut why? Let's check. Example3's input is three [3,3,3] rows, output is same as Example2. So the output for when all rows are same is to have the first row as all 5s and others zero. How does that fit with the previous rule?\n\nSo maybe the correct pattern is:\n\n- If all rows in the input are the same, the output is a matrix where the first row is [5,5,5] and the other rows are [0,0,0].\n\n- Otherwise, sort the rows in descending lexicographical order (preserving original order for ties), then for each original row, the output row has a 5 at the index equal to its position in the sorted list, others 0.\n\nTesting this:\n\nExample0: All rows are not same. Sorted order row0, row1, row2. So outputs as per sorted positions. Which matches.\n\nExample1: All rows are not same. Sorted order row2 (original index2), row1 (index1), row0 (index0). So outputs have 5s at 2,1,0. Which matches.\n\nExample2: All rows same. Output first row all 5s, others zero.\n\nExample3: All same. Same as Example2.\n\nExample4: Rows are two same and one different. Not all same. So sorted order is row0, row1, row2. So outputs 5s at 0,1,2. Which matches.\n\nSo the pattern seems to be:\n\nIf all rows are identical, output first row as all 5s and others 0. Else, sort the rows in descending lex order, maintaining original order for ties. For each original row, the output row has a 5 at the index corresponding to its position in the sorted list, others 0.\n\nNow, applying this to the test input.\n\nTest input:\n\n[4,4,4]\n[2,3,2]\n[3,2,3]\n\nAre all rows the same? No. So proceed to sort the rows in descending lex order.\n\nThe rows are:\n\nRow0: [4,4,4]\n\nRow1: [2,3,2]\n\nRow2: [3,2,3]\n\nComparing each row to determine the sorted order.\n\nCompare row0 vs row2: row0 is [4,4,4], which is larger than row2 [3,2,3] (since first element 4>3). So row0 comes first.\n\nNow, compare row2 and row1: row2 is [3,2,3], row1 is [2,3,2]. Let's compare lex order. First element: 3 vs 2 \u2192 row2 is larger. So sorted order after row0 is row2, then row1.\n\nSo the sorted list is row0 (original index0), row2 (index2), row1 (index1).\n\nTherefore, in the sorted list, the order is:\n\n0: row0 (original index0)\n\n1: row2 (original index2)\n\n2: row1 (original index1)\n\nSo for each original row:\n\nOriginal row0 (sorted position0) \u2192 output row0 has 5 at index0: [5,0,0]\n\nOriginal row1 (sorted position2) \u2192 output row1 has 5 at index2: [0,0,5]\n\nOriginal row2 (sorted position1) \u2192 output row2 has 5 at index1: [0,5,0]\n\nBut wait, the test input's rows are:\n\nOriginal rows:\n\n0: [4,4,4]\n\n1: [2,3,2]\n\n2: [3,2,3]\n\nWhen sorted in descending order:\n\nrow0 (4s) comes first. Then, compare row2 and row1. row2's first element is 3, row1's first is 2. So row2 comes next. Then row1. So sorted order is row0, row2, row1.\n\nThus, the positions for each original row in the sorted list are:\n\nrow0: position0 \u2192 output row0 [5,0,0]\n\nrow1: position2 \u2192 output row1 [0,0,5]\n\nrow2: position1 \u2192 output row2 [0,5,0]\n\nSo the output matrix should be:\n\n[5,0,0]\n\n[0,0,5]\n\n[0,5,0]\n\nBut looking at the training examples, like Example1, where the sorted order was row2, row1, row0. The outputs were [0,0,5], [0,5,0], [5,0,0], which corresponds to the original rows' positions in the sorted list.\n\nThus, applying this to the test input gives the output:\n\nFirst row: [5,0,0]\n\nSecond row: [0,0,5]\n\nThird row: [0,5,0]\n\nWhich matches the pattern.",

        "cot_2": "Okay, let's see. I need to figure out the pattern here. So, there are these input matrices and output matrices, and I have to find the transformation rule that turns the input into the output. Let me go through each example one by one.\n\nStarting with Example 0:\n\nInput:\n[2,2,2]\n[3,2,3]\n[3,3,3]\n\nOutput:\n[5,0,0]\n[0,5,0]\n[0,0,5]\n\nHmm. The output has 5s in the diagonal and 0s elsewhere. But why? Let me compare the input rows. The first row of the input is [2,2,2], and the output is [5,0,0]. The second input row is [3,2,3], output [0,5,0]. Third input row [3,3,3] gives [0,0,5]. So maybe each row in the output is determined by some property of the corresponding input row. \n\nLooking at the first input row: all elements are the same (2,2,2). The output is 5 in the first position. The second row has a 2 in the middle, and 3s elsewhere. The output has 5 in the second position. Third row all 3s, output 5 in third position. Wait, but in example 0, the output's 5s are on the diagonal. So perhaps each row's output has a 5 in the position where that row is unique compared to the others, or maybe it's the row that is either all same or has a different element.\n\nWait, let's check the next example. Example 1:\n\nInput:\n[3,3,3]\n[4,2,2]\n[4,4,2]\n\nOutput:\n[0,0,5]\n[0,5,0]\n[5,0,0]\n\nThe output here has 5s in the third row first position, second row middle, first row last. Let's look at the input rows. The first row is all 3s. The second row has 4,2,2. The third row 4,4,2. The output's 5s are in positions where maybe each row has a unique value compared to the others. For example, the third row has 4,4,2. Comparing to the other rows: the first row is all 3s, which are different. The second row has a 4, but also 2s. The third row's first element is 4, but maybe in the context of the entire column?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is related to the frequency of each number in each column. Let's check. For example 0, each column:\n\nFirst column: 2,3,3 \u2192 the 2 appears once, 3s twice. So maybe the row where the element is unique in the column gets a 5. Wait, but in example 0, the first row's first element is 2, which is unique in that column, so output is 5 in first position. Second row's middle element is 2, which is unique in that column (since other two rows have 3 in middle?), no, wait. Wait in example 0's input columns:\n\nFirst column: 2,3,3 \u2192 so 2 is once, 3s twice. So unique in column is 2. So first row's first element is 2 \u2192 so output for first row first position is 5. Second column: 2,2,3. Wait, input rows are [2,2,2], [3,2,3], [3,3,3]. So second column is 2,2,3. So the 3 is unique. Third column is 2,3,3. So 2 is unique. So for the first row, first column has unique 2 \u2192 5 in first position. Second row, second column has 2 (but in the second column, the third element is 3), so in second row, the middle element is 2. Wait in the second column, there are two 2s and a 3. Wait no, the second column is first row's second element is 2, second row's second is 2, third row's second is 3. So the second column elements are 2,2,3. So the third element is unique (3). So in that column, the third row's middle element is unique. So for the output, the third row's second position would be 5? But in example 0, the output's third row is [0,0,5]. So third position. Hmm, maybe I'm not looking at columns.\n\nAlternatively, maybe for each row, the output's 5 is in the position where that row's element is different from the other rows in the same column. Let me think again. For example, in example 0's input:\n\nRow 0: [2,2,2]\n\nRow 1: [3,2,3]\n\nRow 2: [3,3,3]\n\nFor each element in each row, check if it's the same as the elements in the same column of the other rows.\n\nTake first row, first element 2. In column 0, the other elements are 3 (row1) and 3 (row2). So 2 is unique. So output 5 here. \n\nFirst row, second element 2: column 1 has 2 (row0), 2 (row1), 3 (row2). So two 2s and one 3. So not unique. So output 0.\n\nFirst row, third element 2: column 2 has 2 (row0), 3 (row1), 3 (row2). So unique 2 here. So why isn't the output for row0 [5,0,5]? But the output is [5,0,0]. Hmm, that contradicts. So maybe that's not the right approach.\n\nWait, maybe it's about the majority. Let's see. For each column, the majority is 3 in column 0 (since two 3s and one 2). So for any row in column 0 that is 2 (like row0), which is the minority, it gets a 5? But then in row0's third element (2), column 2 has two 3s and one 2. So 2 is minority, so row0's third element would get 5. But output is [5,0,0]. So that doesn't fit. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe for each row, find the position where the element is the same as the element in the same position of the other rows, but that doesn't seem to fit. Let's try another approach.\n\nLooking at example 2:\n\nInput:\nAll rows are [4,4,4]. Output is [5,5,5] in the first row, others are zeros. Wait, but in example 3, all rows are [3,3,3], and output is [5,5,5] in first row, others zero. So maybe when all rows are the same, the first row in output is all 5s, and others are zeros. But why? Wait, example 4's input is:\n\n[4,4,4]\n[4,4,4]\n[3,3,3]\n\nOutput is [5,0,0], [0,5,0], [0,0,5]. So here, the first two rows are [4,4,4], and the third row is [3,3,3]. The output has 5s along the diagonal. So each row's output has a 5 in the position where that row's element differs from the others in the column? Let's see.\n\nFor example 4:\n\nRow0: 4,4,4. Columns 0: 4,4,3. So in column 0, 4 is in row0 and row1, 3 in row2. So for row0, column0 is 4, which is same as row1, different from row2. So why 5 here? Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe if in a row, all elements are the same, then in the output, that row has 5s in positions where the element is unique in the column. But I'm getting confused.\n\nAnother approach: Looking at the outputs, the 5s are placed such that each row has exactly one 5, and each column has exactly one 5. So it's a permutation matrix, with 5s instead of 1s. The question is how the input determines which permutation.\n\nIn example 0, the output is a diagonal matrix. So maybe when each row has a unique element in a certain column, then the permutation is diagonal. But how?\n\nWait, maybe each row in the output has a 5 in the column where that row's element is the maximum in its row. Let's check.\n\nExample 0's input rows:\n\nRow0: [2,2,2] \u2013 all same. So max is 2. So maybe if all elements are same, the 5 is in first position? But output is [5,0,0], which fits. But in example 2 and 3, when all rows are same, the first row's output is all 5s, others zero. So perhaps in cases where all rows are identical, the first row has all 5s, others zero. That's what example 2 and 3 show.\n\nBut example 4's input has two rows of [4,4,4] and one [3,3,3]. The output is diagonal 5s. So for the first two rows (all 4s), their columns 0 and 1 have 4,4,3. So in column 0, the two 4s, and one 3. So for row0, column0 is 4, same as row1. But in output, row0 has 5 in column0. So maybe the first occurrence of a row with a unique element in a column gets the 5. Wait, but in example 4's third row (3s), each column has 4,4,3. So each column in third row has 3, which is unique. So the third row's output is [0,0,5]. Similarly, for the first row (4s), in column0, the 4 is same as row1's 4. So why does row0 get a 5 in column0 here?\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's about the rows that have a unique value in their respective columns. For example, in example 4:\n\nRow0: [4,4,4] \u2013 columns 0: 4,4,3 \u2192 4 is not unique. Columns 1: 4,4,3 \u2192 same. Columns 2:4,4,3 \u2192 same. So row0's elements are not unique in any column. But output for row0 is [5,0,0]. Hmm. That doesn't fit.\n\nWait maybe the pattern is based on the rows being compared to other rows. Like, for each row, find the position where it differs from the previous rows. Let's try:\n\nIn example 0:\n\nRow0: [2,2,2]. Since it's the first row, maybe no comparison. Then row1: [3,2,3]. Comparing to row0, the elements at positions 0 and 2 are different. So for row1, perhaps the middle position is same as row0. Then row2: [3,3,3]. Comparing to row1, it differs in position 1. So maybe each row's 5 is in the position where it first differs from the previous row. For example, row0 is all 2s. Since there's no prior row, maybe the first position. Row1 differs from row0 in positions 0 and 2. The first differing position is 0, but output for row1 is [0,5,0]. So that doesn't fit. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 5s are placed in positions where the element in the input is different from all elements in the same position in the other rows. Let's check example 0:\n\nRow0: [2,2,2]. For each element in row0, check if it's the same as in other rows in the same column.\n\n- Column0: 2, 3,3. So 2 is unique here. So 5 in position0.\n\n- Column1: 2,2,3. So 2 is not unique (row0 and row1 have 2).\n\n- Column2: 2,3,3. 2 is unique here. So why isn't the output [5,0,5] for row0? But the actual output is [5,0,0]. So this approach may not be correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each row's output is a 5 in the first position where that row's element is different from all other rows in that column. Let's see:\n\nIn example0, row0 has [2,2,2]. For column0, 2 is unique (others are 3). So output 5 in first position. For row1: [3,2,3]. Column1 has 2 (others are 2 and 3). Wait column1 has row0's 2, row1's 2, row2's 3. So row1's column1 is 2, which is same as row0. So no. But row1's output is [0,5,0]. Hmm.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Let's try another example. Example1:\n\nInput:\n[3,3,3]\n[4,2,2]\n[4,4,2]\n\nOutput:\n[0,0,5]\n[0,5,0]\n[5,0,0]\n\nLet's see each row's output.\n\nRow0: [0,0,5]. So 5 is in column2. Row0's elements are all 3. Check columns:\n\n- Column0: 3,4,4. So 3 is unique here. So why 5 in column2?\n\nWait, maybe the 5 is placed in the column where the row's element is different from the other elements in that row. Wait, row0 is all 3s. So no unique element. So why 5 in column2?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for each row, the output 5 is in the column where the element is the same as the element in the same column of the next row. But example1's row0 is [3,3,3], row1 is [4,2,2]. So column0: 3 vs4 (different), column1:3 vs2 (different), column2:3 vs2 (different). So no matches, but output for row0 is [0,0,5]. Hmm, not sure.\n\nLet me think differently. Maybe each output row corresponds to a permutation of the input rows, with 5s indicating where the original row's elements are unique in some way. But how?\n\nLooking at example 4:\n\nInput:\n[4,4,4]\n[4,4,4]\n[3,3,3]\n\nOutput:\n[5,0,0]\n[0,5,0]\n[0,0,5]\n\nHere, all rows are same except the third. But the output is diagonal 5s. So each row gets a 5 in a different column. So maybe the 5s are placed in the first column for the first row, second for the second, third for the third, but only if that position is unique in the column. Wait, but in example4's input, columns 0 and 1 of the first two rows are 4,4,4. So column0 of row0 is 4, same as row1. So why 5 in row0's column0? That's not unique.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is that for each row, if it's the first occurrence of a certain value in its column, then it gets a 5. So:\n\nIn example4, the first row's column0 is 4, which is the first occurrence. So 5. Second row's column1 is 4 (first occurrence? No, row0 has 4 in column1). Third row's column2 is 3, which is unique. So output would be [5,0,0], [0,5,0], [0,0,5]. That fits. Let's check other examples.\n\nExample0:\n\nInput rows:\n\nRow0: [2,2,2]. Columns 0:2 (first occurrence), column1:2 (first), column2:2 (first). But output is [5,0,0]. So only first column gets 5. Hmm. That doesn't fit.\n\nSo maybe the rule is that in each column, the first row that has a value different from the rows below it gets a 5 in that position. Wait, not sure.\n\nAnother angle: the output's 5s are placed such that each column and each row has exactly one 5. So it's a permutation matrix. The question is which permutation is selected based on the input.\n\nLooking for a pattern in the permutation. For example, example0's output is identity matrix. Example1's output is permutation where the third element of the first row is 5, second row's middle, third row's first. So it's a cycle perhaps.\n\nBut how to determine the permutation based on input.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the permutation is determined by the order of unique rows. Let's see example0's input rows: [2,2,2], [3,2,3], [3,3,3]. The unique rows are all three. So the output is diagonal. Example1's input has three unique rows. Output is a permutation where each row's 5 is in a different position.\n\nWait, maybe the permutation is such that each row's 5 is in the position where the row is the first to have that element in its column. Let's try example0:\n\nColumn0: 2,3,3. The first occurrence of a new element is row0 (2), then row1 (3). So for column0, row0 gets 5. Column1: 2,2,3. The first occurrence of 2 is row0, and then 3 in row2. So for column1, row0 has 2 but others are same. Wait, but in output, column1's 5 is in row1. Hmm, this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe for each column, the row that has the maximum value in that column gets a 5. Let's check example0:\n\nColumn0: 2,3,3 \u2192 max is 3 (rows1 and 2). So which row gets the 5? In output, column0 has 5 in row0. But row0's value is 2, which is not the max. So no.\n\nHmm. Let's think about example2 and example3. Both have all rows the same. Their outputs have the first row as all 5s and others 0. So in such cases, the first row is all 5s. For example4, which has two rows of 4s and one row of 3s, the output is diagonal 5s, each row gets a 5 in a different column.\n\nWait, maybe the rule is that for each row, if it's the only one with a certain value in a column, then it gets a 5 in that position, and the permutation is such that each row has exactly one 5 and each column has exactly one 5. If multiple rows qualify, they are arranged in diagonal order. If all rows are the same, first row gets all 5s, others 0.\n\nSo for example0:\n\nRow0's column0 is 2, which is unique in column0. So 5 here.\n\nRow1's column1 is 2, which is unique in column1 (since row0 and row1 have 2, row2 has 3). Wait no, row0 and row1 both have 2 in column1. So why does row1 get 5 here?\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's based on the minimal unique element per column. Like, for each column, find the row where the element is the minimum unique in that column. Let's see example0:\n\nColumn0: 2,3,3. The minimum is 2 (row0). So row0 gets 5 in column0.\n\nColumn1: 2,2,3. The minimum is 2 (rows0 and 1). But in output, row1 gets 5 in column1.\n\nHmm, doesn't fit.\n\nMaybe the pattern is that for each row, the 5 is placed in the position where the row's element is different from the elements in the same position of the previous rows. Let's try:\n\nExample0:\n\nRow0: first row, so no previous rows. Maybe it gets 5 in first position.\n\nRow1: compared to row0, the elements differ at positions 0 and 2. The first differing position is 0. But output for row1 is 5 in position1. Doesn't fit.\n\nRow2: compared to row1, differs in position1. So output for row2 is 5 in position2. Which matches the output. So for example0, row0:5 in position0, row1:5 in position1, row2:5 in position2. Which is the diagonal. But why?\n\nBut example1:\n\nRow0: [3,3,3]. First row, so 5 in position0? But output is [0,0,5].\n\nHmm, that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternative approach: Let's see if the sum of each row in the output is 5. Yes, all outputs have one 5 and two 0s, so sum is 5. So each row must contribute exactly one 5. The positions of the 5s are such that each column has exactly one 5 (permutation matrix). So the problem is to determine the permutation matrix based on the input.\n\nNow, the question is how the input determines the permutation. Maybe the permutation is determined by the order of rows in terms of their uniqueness. For example, in example0, each row is unique. The output is the identity matrix. In example1, the rows are unique as well. Output is a permutation where 5s are in different columns. So perhaps the permutation is such that the first unique row gets the first column, the next unique row the next column, etc., but rotated based on some criteria.\n\nAlternatively, the permutation is determined by the first occurrence of a unique element in each row. Let's look at example1:\n\nInput rows:\n\nRow0: [3,3,3]\nRow1: [4,2,2]\nRow2: [4,4,2]\n\nEach row is unique. The output has 5s in the third column of row0, second of row1, first of row2. So row0's 5 is in column2. Row1's in column1. Row2's in column0. So perhaps the permutation is reversed order. Or maybe the 5s are placed based on the minimal element in the row. Let's see:\n\nRow0: all 3s. Minimal is 3. Maybe column2 (since 3 is in all columns). Doesn't make sense. Row1 has elements 4,2,2. Minimal is 2, which is in columns1 and 2. Output is column1. Row2 has elements 4,4,2. Minimal is 2 in column2. Output is column0. Doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for each row, the 5 is placed in the position where the element is the same as the previous row's next element. Not sure.\n\nWait, example4's input has two rows of [4,4,4] and one of [3,3,3]. Output is diagonal. So first row has 5 in column0, second row in column1, third in column2. But why? The first two rows are identical. So maybe the first two rows are treated as part of a group, and their 5s are placed in different columns. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is determined by the number of times a value appears in each column. For example, if in a column, a value appears once, the corresponding row and position gets a 5. Let's check example0:\n\nColumn0: 2,3,3 \u2192 2 appears once. So row0, column0 gets 5.\n\nColumn1: 2,2,3 \u2192 3 appears once. So row2, column1 gets 5.\n\nColumn2: 2,3,3 \u2192 2 appears once. So row0, column2 gets 5.\n\nBut output for example0 is [5,0,0], [0,5,0], [0,0,5]. So column0's 5 is in row0. Column1's 5 in row1. Column2's in row2. So this approach isn't matching.\n\nWait, but in example0's output, each column has exactly one 5. So how is that determined? Maybe the 5 in each column is placed in the row where the element in that column is the smallest among the column elements. Let's see:\n\nExample0's column0: 2,3,3 \u2192 smallest is 2 (row0). So 5 in row0, column0.\n\nColumn1: 2,2,3 \u2192 smallest is 2 (rows0 and 1). So which row gets it? The first one (row0) or second (row1). Output has row1, column1. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAnother idea: The output is a diagonal matrix when the input rows are in ascending order based on some criteria, and a permutation matrix otherwise. But how to determine the criteria.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each row's 5 is in the position where the element is the same as the element in that position of the next row. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, let's look for the sum of the input rows. For example0:\n\nRow0 sum: 6. Row1 sum: 8. Row2 sum:9. Output is diagonal. Maybe the sum is not relevant.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is a permutation matrix where the position of the 5 in each row is determined by the count of unique elements in that row. For example, if a row has all elements the same, then the 5 is in the first position. Otherwise, in the position where the element is different from others in the row. For example:\n\nExample0's row0 is all 2s. So 5 in first position. Row1: elements 3,2,3. The unique element is 2 in position1. So 5 there. Row2: all 3s. 5 in first position, but output is third position. Hmm, no.\n\nBut in example1's row0 is all 3s. Output has 5 in third position, not first. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAnother angle: Maybe each row's 5 is placed in the position that, when you look at all three elements in that column across the input rows, is the \"distinct\" one. For example, in example0:\n\nColumn0: 2,3,3. The 2 is distinct, so row0 gets 5 in column0.\n\nColumn1: 2,2,3. The 3 is distinct, so row2 gets 5 in column1.\n\nColumn2: 2,3,3. The 2 is distinct, so row0 gets 5 in column2.\n\nBut the output for example0 is diagonal, which doesn't match this. So row0's output would be [5,0,5], but actual output is [5,0,0]. So this can't be.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for each row, the 5 is placed in the position where that row's element is the same as the next row's element. For example:\n\nExample0's row0: [2,2,2]. Next row (row1): [3,2,3]. So in column1, both are 2. So row0's 5 is in column1. But output is [5,0,0]. So no.\n\nThis is really tricky. Let's try to find a pattern that works across all examples.\n\nLooking at example4:\n\nInput:\n[4,4,4]\n[4,4,4]\n[3,3,3]\n\nOutput:\n[5,0,0]\n[0,5,0]\n[0,0,5]\n\nThe output is diagonal. The first two input rows are same. The third is different. So perhaps, for the first two rows, since they are the same, their 5s are placed in diagonal positions (first and second columns), and the third row gets the third column. But how does that happen when the first two rows are identical?\n\nAlternatively, when rows are identical, their 5s are placed in different columns, starting from the first column, but I'm not sure.\n\nAnother approach: the output seems to be a permutation matrix where the 5s are placed in the same positions as the 5s in the identity matrix if all rows are unique, and otherwise adjusted based on duplicates. For example, when all rows are same (examples2 and3), the first row has all 5s, others 0. When two rows are same and one different (example4), the output is diagonal. But in example4, the first two rows are same, but output is diagonal. So how does that work?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule is that for each row, the 5 is placed in the column corresponding to the number of times that row has appeared. For example, the first occurrence of a particular row gets column0, the second occurrence gets column1, etc. But in example4, the first two rows are same. So first occurrence would be column0, second occurrence column1. Third row is different, gets column2. So output is [5,0,0], [0,5,0], [0,0,5]. That fits example4. Let's check example0:\n\nExample0's rows are all unique. So first row gets column0, second column1, third column2. Which matches the diagonal output. Example1's rows are all unique. So first row (all 3s) gets column0. But example1's output is [0,0,5]. So that doesn't fit. So this idea might not be correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is determined by the order in which unique rows appear. For example, the first unique row's 5 is in column0, the next in column1, etc. But example1's output doesn't fit that.\n\nLet's think of another way. The output's 5s are in such a way that each row has a 5 in a different column. So it's a permutation. The permutation is determined by the order of the rows in the input. For example, the first row's 5 is in the first available column that hasn't been used by previous rows. For example:\n\nIn example0:\n\nRow0 is the first row. 5 in column0.\n\nRow1 is the next unique row. 5 in column1.\n\nRow2 is next. 5 in column2.\n\nSo diagonal.\n\nExample1's rows are all unique. The first row is [3,3,3]. So 5 in column0. But output is [0,0,5]. So that doesn't fit.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternatively, the permutation is such that the first row's 5 is in the column where it has a unique element, then the next row's 5 is in the next column where it's unique, etc. But how.\n\nLet's think about example4 again. The first two rows are [4,4,4], third is [3,3,3]. So for the first two rows, in all columns, they have 4s. The third row has 3s. So in each column, the third row's element is unique (3), so each column's 5 is in the third row. But the output has diagonal 5s. So this approach doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is diagonal if all rows are unique, but when some rows are the same, the 5s are shifted. But example4's output is diagonal even though the first two rows are same.\n\nThis is very confusing. Let's try to look for another pattern.\n\nIn example0, the output is diagonal. Each input row has a unique element in a different column compared to the other rows. For example, row0 has 2s, which are unique in column0. Row1 has 2 in column1 which is unique (but in column1, there are two 2s and a 3. Wait, no. In example0's input:\n\nRow0: [2,2,2]\n\nRow1: [3,2,3]\n\nRow2: [3,3,3]\n\nSo column0: 2,3,3 \u2192 row0's 2 is unique.\n\nColumn1: 2,2,3 \u2192 row0 and row1 have 2s, row2 has 3. So unique in column1 is row2's 3.\n\nColumn2: 2,3,3 \u2192 row0's 2 is unique.\n\nSo in column0, row0 has unique 2 \u2192 5 in row0, column0.\n\nColumn1, row2 has unique 3 \u2192 5 in row2, column1.\n\nColumn2, row0 has unique 2 \u2192 5 in row0, column2.\n\nBut the output for row0 is [5,0,0], which only has 5 in column0. So this doesn't fit. So that's not the pattern.\n\nAnother observation: In example4, the third row is different from the first two. The output's third row has 5 in column2. For the first two rows, even though they are the same, their output 5s are in different columns (columns0 and 1). How is that possible? Maybe it's based on their row index. Like, for duplicate rows, their 5s are placed in their respective row indices. So first row (index0) gets column0, second row (index1) gets column1, third row (index2) gets column2. But that would only work if the rows are ordered such that each gets their own column, regardless of their content. But in example0, that's the case. In example4, first two rows are same, but their 5s are in column0 and 1. So perhaps the pattern is that each row's output 5 is placed in the column equal to its row index. But example1's output:\n\nRow0: [0,0,5]. So column2 for row0.\n\nRow1: [0,5,0]. Column1 for row1.\n\nRow2: [5,0,0]. Column0 for row2.\n\nSo row indexes are 0,1,2. But columns are 2,1,0. So reversed. So maybe the permutation is reversed row order.\n\nSo example1's output is the reverse of the diagonal. Row0 gets column2, row1 column1, row2 column0. That's a possibility. But why?\n\nWhat's different between example0 and example1? example0's input rows are sorted in increasing order based on their elements. Row0 has 2s, row1 has 3s and 2, row2 has 3s. Maybe the permutation depends on the order of the rows when sorted. For example, if the rows are sorted in a certain order, the permutation is determined by that.\n\nBut example0's rows aren't sorted numerically. For instance, row1 is [3,2,3], which numerically is higher than row0 but lower than row2.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the permutation is based on the sum of each row. For example, rows with higher sums get 5s in later columns. But example0's row sums are 6, 8,9. Output is diagonal. Example1's row sums are 9, 8, 10. Output is [0,0,5], [0,5,0], [5,0,0]. So row0 has sum9 (highest?), row1 8, row2 10 (highest). Output's row0 has 5 in column2 (third position), row2 has 5 in column0. Doesn't seem to fit.\n\nThis is really challenging. Let me try to look for another pattern.\n\nAnother idea: The output's 5s are placed in the same position as the input's elements that are the same as the elements in the same position of the next row. For example:\n\nExample0:\n\nRow0: [2,2,2]. Row1: [3,2,3]. Comparing row0 to row1, the middle element is the same (2). So row0's 5 is in the middle. But output is [5,0,0]. So that doesn't fit.\n\nExample4:\n\nRow0: [4,4,4]. Row1: [4,4,4]. Comparing row0 to row1, all elements are same. So no matching elements. So maybe row0's 5 is in the first position. Output is [5,0,0], which fits. Row1: compared to row2 [3,3,3], no same elements. So row1's 5 in second position. Row2's 5 in third. So that fits.\n\nExample1's rows:\n\nRow0: [3,3,3]. Row1: [4,2,2]. No same elements. So row0's 5 in first position. But output has 5 in column2. So that doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. Not helpful.\n\nPerhaps the pattern is based on the number of times each row appears. For example, if a row is unique, its 5 is placed in a certain way. If multiple rows are the same, their 5s are placed in different columns.\n\nIn example4, first two rows are the same. So their 5s are placed in different columns (0 and 1), third row different, placed in 2. So for duplicate rows, the 5s are placed in columns corresponding to their order in the input.\n\nSo for example, the first occurrence of a row gets column0, second occurrence column1, etc. But when the rows are unique, their 5s are placed based on another rule.\n\nBut in example0, all rows are unique. So their 5s are in columns 0,1,2. Which fits.\n\nIn example1, all rows are unique. So their 5s should be in columns 0,1,2. But output is [0,0,5], [0,5,0], [5,0,0], which is columns 2,1,0. So the reverse. So perhaps when all rows are unique, the permutation is reversed. But why?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the permutation is determined by the sorted order of the rows. Let's sort the rows in example0:\n\nSorted rows would be [2,2,2], [3,2,3], [3,3,3]. Output is diagonal. If the permutation is based on sorted order, perhaps the first sorted row gets column0, next column1, etc. But example1's rows sorted would be [3,3,3], [4,2,2], [4,4,2]. Output's 5s are in columns 2,1,0. So reversed. So maybe the permutation is reverse of the sorted order. But I'm not sure.\n\nThis is getting me nowhere. Let me try to think of another angle. Maybe the output is a permutation matrix where each row's 5 is in the column that corresponds to the row's position when the input rows are sorted in a certain way.\n\nFor example, in example0:\n\nRows are [2,2,2], [3,2,3], [3,3,3]. If we sort them in ascending order (assuming numerical order), they are as they are. So the first row gets column0, second column1, third column2. Which matches the diagonal output.\n\nIn example1:\n\nRows are [3,3,3], [4,2,2], [4,4,2]. Sorting these in ascending order (lexicographical order?), the sorted order would be [3,3,3], [4,2,2], [4,4,2]. So the first sorted row (row0) gets column0, second (row1) column1, third (row2) column2. But output for example1 is [0,0,5], [0,5,0], [5,0,0], which is columns 2,1,0. So reversed. So maybe the permutation is based on the reverse of the sorted order.\n\nBut then why would example0 have a diagonal output (sorted order) while example1 has reverse?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the permutation is determined by the reverse of the order of rows when sorted in reverse order. This is getting too vague.\n\nAnother observation: In example4, the first two rows are the same. When sorted, they would be considered equal. So their order in the input determines their permutation columns. The first occurrence gets column0, second column1, and the third row gets column2. So the output is diagonal, which fits example4's output.\n\nExample0's rows are unique, so sorted order gives them columns 0,1,2. Output is diagonal.\n\nExample1's rows are unique. If sorted order is [3,3,3], [4,2,2], [4,4,2], but the output's permutation is reversed. So maybe when the rows are not all identical, the permutation is determined by the reverse of their sorted order.\n\nSo for example1:\n\nSorted rows: row0, row1, row2. Output's permutation is row2, row1, row0. So 5s in columns 2,1,0.\n\nThat would fit example1's output. So the rule could be: sort the rows in ascending order, and then reverse the order to assign the 5s.\n\nBut why would that be the case? That seems arbitrary.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the permutation is determined by the order of the rows in reverse. For example, the last row gets column0, second last column1, etc. Let's check example0's rows in reverse order:\n\nRow2, row1, row0. So the permutation would be row2 gets column0, row1 column1, row0 column2. But example0's output is diagonal, so row0 column0, row1 column1, row2 column2. So no.\n\nExample1's rows in reverse order: row2, row1, row0. Output's 5s are in columns0,1,2 for these rows. So row2's 5 is in column0, row1 in column1, row0 in column2. Which matches example1's output.\n\nAh, this might be the pattern!\n\nSo the permutation is such that the 5s are placed in the columns corresponding to the reverse order of the rows. For example:\n\n- In example0, the rows are in the original order. But the output is diagonal (columns0,1,2). Which is the same as the original order, not reversed. So this doesn't fit.\n\nWait, example1's rows are in order row0, row1, row2. When reversed, the order is row2, row1, row0. The output's permutation assigns 5s to columns0,1,2 for these reversed rows. So row2 (which is now first in the reversed list) gets column0, row1 (second) gets column1, row0 (third) gets column2. Which matches example1's output.\n\nExample4's rows are row0 and row1 same, row2 different. Reversed order is row2, row1, row0. So row2 gets column0, row1 column1, row0 column2. But the output for example4 is diagonal. So row0 column0, row1 column1, row2 column2. This contradicts.\n\nSo this idea doesn't hold.\n\nI'm really stuck. Let's try to find another way. Let's consider that each row in the output has a 5 in the column corresponding to the number of unique elements before it in the input. For example, if a row is the first unique instance, it gets column0, the second column1, etc. But example1's rows are all unique, so they would get columns0,1,2. But output is 2,1,0. So no.\n\nAlternatively, the permutation is based on the row's position in the input when sorted in reverse order. Let's see example1's rows sorted in reverse order (descending):\n\nRow2: [4,4,2], row1: [4,2,2], row0: [3,3,3]. So sorted as row2, row1, row0. The output's permutation is row2 column0, row1 column1, row0 column2. Which matches example1's output. So the permutation is based on the reverse sorted order of the rows.\n\nExample0's rows sorted in reverse order would be row2 [3,3,3], row1 [3,2,3], row0 [2,2,2]. So sorted as row2, row1, row0. So permutation would be row2 column0, row1 column1, row0 column2. But example0's output is diagonal, so row0 column0, row1 column1, row2 column2. Which doesn't fit. So this idea is invalid.\n\nAnother Idea: Perhaps the 5s are placed in the output such that each 5 is in the column where the input's row has the maximum value in that row. Let's check.\n\nExample0:\n\nRow0: [2,2,2]. All same. Maybe first position. Output [5,0,0].\n\nRow1: [3,2,3]. Max is 3, occurring in positions0 and 2. So which one? Output is [0,5,0]. Doesn't fit.\n\nExample1:\n\nRow0: [3,3,3]. Max is 3. Output [0,0,5]. So column2.\n\nRow1: [4,2,2]. Max is 4 in column0. Output [0,5,0]. Doesn't fit.\n\nSo this isn't right.\n\nLet me think of a different approach. Maybe each row's 5 is in the column where that row's element is the same as the element in the same column of the previous row. But example0's row1 compared to row0: elements differ in columns0 and 2. So row1's 5 is in column1. Output has row1's 5 in column1. That fits. Row2 compared to row1: differs in column1. So row2's 5 in column1? No, output is column2. So no.\n\nAlternatively, the 5 is in the first column where the row differs from the previous row. For example, row0 is [2,2,2]. Previous row is none, so 5 in first column. Row1 differs from row0 in column0 and 2. First differing column is 0, but output is column1. Doesn't fit.\n\nI'm running out of ideas. Let's look at the test input and see if I can find a pattern based on the examples provided.\n\nTest input:\n\n[4,4,4]\n\n[2,3,2]\n\n[3,2,3]\n\nWhat would be the expected output?\n\nLooking at the training examples, when there are unique rows, the output is a permutation matrix. When rows are identical, the output's first row has all 5s (if all are same) or diagonal if there are duplicates.\n\nThe test input has three rows. Let's see if they are all unique.\n\nRow0: [4,4,4]\n\nRow1: [2,3,2]\n\nRow2: [3,2,3]\n\nAll rows are unique. So according to the examples where all rows are unique (like example0 and example1), the output is a permutation matrix. But which permutation?\n\nIn example0, the output is diagonal. In example1, it's a different permutation (reverse order? Or based on something else).\n\nIn example0, the rows are [2,2,2], [3,2,3], [3,3,3]. The output is diagonal. So each row's 5 is in the same position as the row's index.\n\nIn example1, rows are [3,3,3], [4,2,2], [4,4,2]. Output is [0,0,5], [0,5,0], [5,0,0]. So 5s are in columns 2,1,0. Which is the reverse of the row indices.\n\nSo why the difference? What's the determining factor between a diagonal and reversed diagonal permutation?\n\nLooking at the input rows, example0's rows are in increasing order of their elements (row0 has 2s, row1 has a mix, row2 has 3s). Example1's rows are in a different order. Maybe the permutation depends on the sorted order of the rows.\n\nLet's sort the test input's rows in lexicographical order.\n\nTest input rows:\n\nRow0: [4,4,4]\n\nRow1: [2,3,2]\n\nRow2: [3,2,3]\n\nSorted lexicographically (comparing elements from left to right):\n\nRow1: [2,3,2] comes first.\n\nRow2: [3,2,3] comes next.\n\nRow0: [4,4,4] last.\n\nSo sorted order is row1, row2, row0.\n\nIf the permutation is based on this sorted order, the 5s would be placed in columns 0,1,2 for the sorted rows. But the original row order is row0, row1, row2. So the output's permutation would assign:\n\nRow1 (first in sorted order) gets column0.\n\nRow2 (second) gets column1.\n\nRow0 (third) gets column2.\n\nBut the test input's rows are in the order row0, row1, row2. So according to this, the output would be:\n\nRow0 (original row0) is third in sorted order \u2192 column2.\n\nRow1 (original row1) is first \u2192 column0.\n\nRow2 (original row2) is second \u2192 column1.\n\nSo the output would be:\n\nRow0: [0,0,5]\n\nRow1: [5,0,0]\n\nRow2: [0,5,0]\n\nBut I need to check if this aligns with any of the training examples.\n\nExample1's sorted rows would be [3,3,3], [4,2,2], [4,4,2]. The output permutation assigns 5s to columns2,1,0, which is reverse of the sorted order. So maybe the permutation is the reverse of the sorted order.\n\nIn the test input's case, sorted order is row1, row2, row0. Reverse of this order is row0, row2, row1. So the 5s would be placed in columns0,1,2 for the reverse order.\n\nWait, this is getting too confusing. Let me try to apply this to the test input.\n\nIf the output permutation is based on the reverse of the sorted order:\n\nSorted order is row1, row2, row0 \u2192 reverse is row0, row2, row1.\n\nSo the permutation would assign 5s to:\n\nRow0 \u2192 column0.\n\nRow2 \u2192 column1.\n\nRow1 \u2192 column2.\n\nBut the original rows are ordered row0, row1, row2. So the output would be:\n\nRow0: [5,0,0]\n\nRow1: [0,0,5]\n\nRow2: [0,5,0]\n\nWhich would look like:\n\n[5,0,0]\n\n[0,0,5]\n\n[0,5,0]\n\nBut I need to check if this aligns with any training example's pattern.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the permutation is such that the 5s are in the columns corresponding to the original row indices when the rows are sorted in reverse order.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the permutation is determined by the position of the row in the sorted list.\n\nFor example, in example1, when sorted in ascending order, the rows are row0, row1, row2. But the output's permutation is row2, row1, row0. So the 5s are in reverse order.\n\nIf this is the case, then for the test input's sorted rows (row1, row2, row0), the permutation would be row0, row2, row1. So:\n\nRow0 (original row0) is third in the sorted list \u2192 column0.\n\nRow2 (original row2) is second \u2192 column1.\n\nRow1 (original row1) is first \u2192 column2.\n\nSo the output would be:\n\nRow0: [5,0,0]\n\nRow1: [0,0,5]\n\nRow2: [0,5,0]\n\nBut how does this fit with the training examples?\n\nExample0's sorted rows are row0, row1, row2. Output is diagonal (columns0,1,2). Which is same as sorted order. Example1's sorted rows are row0, row1, row2. Output is columns2,1,0. So reverse of sorted order. So there's inconsistency.\n\nThis suggests that the permutation may alternate between sorted and reverse sorted based on some condition. But I can't find a pattern.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and not finding a clear pattern, I'll have to make an educated guess based on the examples.\n\nLooking at example4's input:\n\n[4,4,4]\n\n[4,4,4]\n\n[3,3,3]\n\nOutput is diagonal. This suggests that when there are duplicate rows, they are each assigned to different columns based on their row index. So the first row gets column0, second column1, third column2. Even if they are duplicates.\n\nIn the test input:\n\nRow0: [4,4,4]\n\nRow1: [2,3,2]\n\nRow2: [3,2,3]\n\nAll rows are unique. So based on example0 and example1, when all rows are unique, the output is a permutation matrix. But which permutation?\n\nIn example0, the output is diagonal (identity matrix). In example1, it's reversed. What's the difference between them? Example0's rows are ordered such that each row has higher values than the previous. Example1's rows are ordered differently.\n\nAlternatively, the permutation is diagonal when the rows are in increasing order of their first elements. Let's check:\n\nExample0's first elements: 2,3,3. Not increasing. Example1's first elements:3,4,4. Increasing. Output is reversed. So no.\n\nAnother idea: The permutation is diagonal if all rows are sorted in ascending order, otherwise reversed. But example0's rows are not sorted, but output is diagonal. So no.\n\nAt this point, I think the pattern is that each row in the output has a 5 in the column corresponding to its row index if the rows are unique, and if there are duplicates, they are assigned different columns. However, examples like example1 show that this isn't always the case.\n\nBut given the test input has three unique rows, and the output should be a permutation matrix, perhaps the answer is similar to example1, where the permutation is reversed. But without knowing the exact rule, it's hard to say.\n\nAlternatively, looking at example4's input where two rows are same and one is different, the output is diagonal. So perhaps when there's a mix of same and different rows, the output is diagonal. But in example4's case, the third row is different, and the output is diagonal.\n\nIn the test input, all rows are unique. So maybe the output is diagonal. But example0's output is diagonal with unique rows, example1's isn't. So this doesn't fit.\n\nGiven that I'm stuck, I'll have to make a guess based on the closest example. The test input's first row is [4,4,4], which is similar to example4's first two rows. The other rows are [2,3,2] and [3,2,3]. \n\nLooking at example4's output when there are two rows of 4s and one of 3s, the output is diagonal. So perhaps the test input's output is also diagonal. But the first row is [4,4,4], which is unique. The other rows are unique. So perhaps the output is diagonal. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, looking at example1's input, which has a row of 3s, then a row with 4,2,2, then 4,4,2. The output's 5s are in reverse order. So for the test input's rows: [4,4,4], [2,3,2], [3,2,3], the output might be diagonal, or maybe the 5s are in reverse.\n\nBut without a clear pattern, I'll have to make an educated guess. Based on example0 and example4, when there's a mix of rows that are same and unique, the output is diagonal. For the test input, all rows are unique. So maybe the output is diagonal. But example1's unique rows are not diagonal. So perhaps the output is diagonal if the rows are in a certain order.\n\nAlternatively, looking at example0 and example4, when the first row is unique in its column, the output is diagonal. For the test input's first row [4,4,4], in column0, all elements are 4 (row0), 2 (row1), 3 (row2). So row0's 4 is unique in column0. So 5 in row0, column0. Row1's column1 is 3, which is unique (row1 has 3, row0 has 4, row2 has 2). So 5 in row1, column1. Row2's column2 is3, which is unique (row0 has 4, row1 has 2, row2 has3). So 5 in row2, column2. Thus, diagonal.\n\nYes! That makes sense. So the pattern is: for each row, place a 5 in the column where the element in that row and column is unique across all elements in that column. If there are multiple unique elements in a column, only the first row in the input that has a unique element gets the 5. Wait, but example0's column2 has row0's 2, others are 3. So 5 in row0, column2. But the output for row0 is [5,0,0]. So this contradicts.\n\nWait, but according to that pattern, row0's column0 and column2 would have 5s. But the output only has 5 in column0. So this approach isn't correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule is that for each row, the 5 is placed in the first column where that row's element is unique in its column. Let's apply this to example0:\n\nRow0: columns0 has 2 (unique), so 5 in column0.\n\nRow1: column1 has 2 (not unique), but column0 has 3 (not unique), column2 has3 (not unique). Wait, no. For row1, columns0 and 2 have 3, which are same as row2. Column1 has 2, which is same as row0. So no unique elements. But output has row1's 5 in column1. So this doesn't fit.\n\nThis suggests that the rule is more complex. Perhaps it's based on the number of times a row's element appears in its column, and the first row with a unique element in a column gets the 5. But then each column can have only one 5, and each row can have only one 5.\n\nLet me try applying this to example0:\n\nColumns:\n\n- Column0: 2,3,3 \u2192 unique element is 2 (row0). So row0 gets 5 in column0.\n\n- Column1: 2,2,3 \u2192 unique element is 3 (row2). So row2 gets 5 in column1.\n\n- Column2: 2,3,3 \u2192 unique element is 2 (row0). So row0 gets 5 in column2.\n\nBut this results in row0 having two 5s, which contradicts the output. Thus, this can't be the rule.\n\nAnother possibility: For each row, the 5 is placed in the column where the row's element is the only one of its kind in the entire matrix. But example0's row0 has 2s, which are unique in the matrix. So 5s would be in all columns, but output is [5,0,0]. So this doesn't fit.\n\nI think I've exhausted all possible avenues. Given the time I've spent and the lack of progress, I'll have to make an educated guess based on the test input's structure and the examples.\n\nThe test input is:\n\n[4,4,4]\n\n[2,3,2]\n\n[3,2,3]\n\nLooking at each column:\n\nColumn0: 4,2,3 \u2192 all unique. So each row's element is unique in this column.\n\nColumn1:4,3,2 \u2192 all unique.\n\nColumn2:4,2,3 \u2192 all unique.\n\nSo in each column, all elements are unique. Thus, each column's 5 can be assigned to any row. But according to the examples, each column must have exactly one 5.\n\nSince each column has all unique elements, perhaps each row's 5 is placed in the column corresponding to its row index (diagonal), but I'm not sure. However, in example0, when columns have unique elements, the output is diagonal. So for the test input, which has all columns with unique elements, the output might be diagonal. So:\n\nRow0: 5 in column0 \u2192 [5,0,0]\n\nRow1:5 in column1 \u2192 [0,5,0]\n\nRow2:5 in column2 \u2192 [0,0,5]\n\nBut this would be the diagonal matrix. But according to example1, when columns have unique elements, the output isn't diagonal. So perhaps the rule is that if all columns have unique elements, the output is diagonal. But example1's columns:\n\nColumn0:3,4,4 \u2192 not unique.\n\nColumn1:3,2,4 \u2192 unique.\n\nColumn2:3,2,2 \u2192 not unique.\n\nSo only column1 has unique elements. So that example's output isn't diagonal.\n\nBut in the test input, all columns have unique elements. So the output could be diagonal. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, since all elements in the test input's columns are unique, each row's 5 is placed in the column corresponding to the minimal element in the row. For example:\n\nRow0: [4,4,4]. All elements are 4. So minimal is 4, but all are same. So perhaps first column.\n\nRow1: [2,3,2]. Minimal is 2, occurs in columns0 and 2. First occurrence is column0.\n\nRow2: [3,2,3]. Minimal is 2, occurs in column1.\n\nSo output would be:\n\nRow0: [5,0,0]\n\nRow1: [5,0,0] (since 2 is in column0 and 2, but minimal is 2, first occurrence is column0)\n\nRow2: [0,5,0]\n\nBut this results in two 5s in column0 and two rows having 5s, which violates the permutation matrix requirement. So this can't be.\n\nGiven that I'm stuck, and considering that the test input's columns all have unique elements, and each row's elements are unique in their columns, the output must be a permutation matrix where each row's 5 is in the column where its element is unique. Since all elements are unique in their columns, each row can have a 5 in any column, but each column must have exactly one 5. The only way this can happen is if the 5s are placed such that each column has exactly one 5, which forms a permutation matrix. But how to determine which permutation.\n\nLooking at example0's output where all columns have unique elements (except column1 has two 2s and a 3), the output is diagonal. In the test input, all columns have unique elements. So perhaps the output is diagonal. Thus, the test input's output would be diagonal.\n\nBut how to confirm. Let's see:\n\nTest input:\n\nRow0: [4,4,4]. Each column's element is unique. So row0's 5 could be in column0 (since 4 is unique in column0).\n\nRow1: [2,3,2]. In column0, 2 is unique. In column1, 3 is unique. In column2, 2 is unique. But since each row can have only one 5, perhaps the 5 is placed in the first column where the element is unique.\n\nFor row1, column0: element 2 is unique (only row1 has 2 in column0). So 5 in column0. But then row0's 5 is also in column0, which is invalid. So this can't be.\n\nAlternatively, for each column, assign the 5 to the row that has the minimal element in that column.\n\nColumn0 elements:4,2,3 \u2192 minimal is 2 (row1).\n\nColumn1:4,3,2 \u2192 minimal is 2 (row2).\n\nColumn2:4,2,3 \u2192 minimal is 2 (row1).\n\nBut this would result in row1 having two 5s (columns0 and2), which isn't allowed.\n\nAlternatively, for each column, assign the 5 to the row that has the maximal element.\n\nColumn0: max 4 (row0).\n\nColumn1: max 4 (row0).\n\nColumn2: max4 (row0).\n\nBut then row0 would have three 5s, which isn't allowed.\n\nThus, this approach doesn't work.\n\nGiven the time I've spent, I'll have to make a guess. The closest example is example4, where two rows are the same and one is different, leading to a diagonal output. The test input has three unique rows, so perhaps the output is diagonal. But without more examples, this is a risky guess.\n\nAlternatively, considering the test input's rows:\n\nRow0: [4,4,4]\n\nRow1: [2,3,2]\n\nRow2: [3,2,3]\n\nComparing to example1's input:\n\nRow0: [3,3,3]\n\nRow1: [4,2,2]\n\nRow2: [4,4,2]\n\nExample1's output is [0,0,5], [0,5,0], [5,0,0]. So the 5s are placed in the third, second, and first columns.\n\nThe test input's rows are similar in structure. So perhaps the output is a reverse diagonal.\n\nFor test input:\n\nRow0: [4,4,4] \u2192 5 in column2.\n\nRow1: [2,3,2] \u2192 5 in column1.\n\nRow2: [3,2,3] \u2192 5 in column0.\n\nSo output would be:\n\n[0,0,5]\n\n[0,5,0]\n\n[5,0,0]\n\nBut I need to check if this makes sense. For example, in row0's column2, the element is4. Column2 elements are4,2,3. So 4 is unique in column2. So row0's 5 would be in column2.\n\nRow1's column1 element is3. Column1 elements are4,3,2. So3 is unique. So row1's 5 is in column1.\n\nRow2's column0 element is3. Column0 elements are4,2,3. So3 is unique. So row2's 5 is in column0.\n\nThus, the output would be:\n\n[0,0,5]\n\n[0,5,0]\n\n[5,0,0]\n\nThis matches the structure of example1's output. \n\nSo applying this logic to the test input, the answer would be:\n\n[0,0,5]\n\n[0,5,0]\n\n[5,0,0]\n\nBut I need to confirm if this aligns with the training examples.\n\nIn example1, the output is similar. The first row has 5 in column2, second in column1, third in column0. So this seems to fit.\n\nThus, the pattern is that for each row, the 5 is placed in the column where the element is unique in that column. Since in the test input, each row has one element that is unique in its column, the 5s are placed accordingly. \n\nFor example:\n\nRow0's column2 has 4, which is unique in column2 (other elements are2 and3).\n\nRow1's column1 has3, unique in column1.\n\nRow2's column0 has3, unique in column0.\n\nThus, the output is:\n\n[0,0,5]\n\n[0,5,0]\n\n[5,0,0]"
