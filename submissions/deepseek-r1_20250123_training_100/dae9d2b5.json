        "cot_1": "Okay, let's tackle this puzzle. So, the task is to figure out the pattern that transforms the input lists into the output lists. Let's look at the training examples carefully.\n\nStarting with Example 0. The input has three rows:\n\n[4,4,0,3,3,0]\n[4,0,0,3,0,0]\n[0,0,0,0,0,3]\n\nThe output is:\n\n[6,6,0]\n[6,0,0]\n[0,0,6]\n\nHmm. Let's see how the numbers change. Notice that in the input, the numbers are 4, 3, and 0. The output has 6 and 0. Maybe adding 4 and 3 gives 7, but in the output it's 6. Wait, maybe there's a different approach. Let's check the positions.\n\nLooking at the first input row: [4,4,0,3,3,0]. The output is [6,6,0]. If we split the input into pairs: the first two elements (4,4), then next two (0,3), then next two (3,0). Then, sum each pair? 4+4=8, 0+3=3, 3+0=3. But the output is 6,6,0. That doesn't directly add up. Alternatively, maybe count the number of non-zero elements in each pair and multiply by some value.\n\nWait, in the first input row, the first pair has two 4s, which are non-zero. The second pair is 0 and 3, so one non-zero. Third pair is 3 and 0, again one non-zero. But output is 6,6,0. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe each pair contributes to the output in a different way.\n\nWait, looking at the output for Example 0's first row: [6,6,0]. The first two elements of the output are 6 each, which might correspond to the first two pairs in the input. Let's see:\n\nFirst input pair (4,4) \u2192 output 6. Second pair (0,3) \u2192 output 6. Third pair (3,0) \u2192 output 0. Hmm. So maybe if both elements in the pair are non-zero, sum them but not directly. Or perhaps each 4 and 3 in a pair contributes to a 6 in the output. For example, in the first pair, two 4s. If each 4 counts as contributing to the first element of the output, maybe adding them up. But 4+4=8, which isn't 6. So that's not it.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each 4 and 3 in a pair represents a direction or something else. Wait, maybe the input is split into two parts: the first three elements and the next three elements. Let's see. For example, the first input row in Example 0 is [4,4,0,3,3,0]. If we split into two groups of three: [4,4,0] and [3,3,0]. Maybe each group is summed or processed to form the output. The output for Example 0's first row is [6,6,0]. Let's see: 4+4+0=8, but 6. 3+3+0=6. So maybe the first three elements sum to 8, but output is 6. Not matching. Alternatively, count the number of non-zero elements. For the first group, two 4s and a 0: two non-zero. Multiply by 3? 2*3=6. Second group: two 3s and a 0: two non-zero, 2*3=6. Third group? Wait, the output has three elements. Wait, maybe each pair of elements in the input becomes a single element in the output. Let's see: the input has 6 elements, so three pairs. So each pair becomes one output element. For example, input pairs (4,4), (0,3), (3,0). For each pair, if the sum of the pair is 4+4=8 \u2192 6? 0+3=3 \u2192 6? 3+0=3 \u2192 0? That doesn't make sense. Alternatively, if in a pair, if there's a 4 and/or a 3, they contribute to 6. For example, each 4 is converted to 6 when in a pair? But how? Maybe each pair is treated as a sum, but 4 and 3 are converted to 3 and 3 respectively. Then 4+4=8 becomes 3+3=6. 0+3=3 becomes 0+3=3. Hmm but then the output would be 6,3,3 which doesn't match. Alternatively, if 4 and 3 are both replaced by 3, then sum. So 4 becomes 3, 3 becomes 3. So pair (4,4) becomes 3+3=6. Pair (0,3) becomes 0+3=3. But output is 6,6,0. So that's not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the presence of both 4 and 3 in the same pair leads to a 6. For example, in Example 0's first input row, the first pair has two 4s. If 4 and 3 are part of a code, maybe 4 represents 3 and 3 represents 3. Wait, adding them. But that doesn't make sense. Let's check another example.\n\nTake Example 1's input:\n\nInput row 0: [4,0,4,3,3,0]. Output row 0: [6,6,6].\n\nSplitting into pairs: (4,0), (4,3), (3,0). Output elements are 6,6,6. So for the first pair (4,0), maybe if there's a 4, it contributes 6 if there's at least one 4 or 3 in the pair. But (4,0) becomes 6. Then (4,3) would be 6 as well, and (3,0) becomes 6? How?\n\nAlternatively, maybe each 4 in the input is turned into a 3 and each 3 into a 3, and then each pair is summed. So 4 becomes 3, 3 becomes 3. Then pair (4,0) becomes 3+0=3. But output is 6. That doesn't add up. Hmm.\n\nWait, looking at the outputs, all the numbers are 0 or 6. So perhaps the output is 6 if certain conditions are met in the input pair, otherwise 0. Let's see.\n\nIn Example 0's first input pair (4,4): output 6. Second pair (0,3): output 6. Third pair (3,0): output 0. Hmm. So when a pair has 4 and 4, it's 6. If a pair has 0 and 3, it's 6. But the third pair (3,0) gives 0. That's inconsistent. Wait, in the second pair (0,3) in the first example's input, the output is 6. The third pair (3,0) outputs 0. So maybe the order matters. Like, if the left element is non-zero, then it's 6. Or perhaps if either element is non-zero, but only if they are in a certain position.\n\nAlternatively, maybe for each pair, if the sum of 4's and 3's is at least one, then 6. But in the first pair (4,4) sum is 8 (if 4 is counted as 4), which would be more than zero. So 6. Second pair (0,3): sum 3, 6. Third pair (3,0): sum 3, but output is 0. So that doesn't fit. Unless there's a different rule.\n\nWait, maybe in each pair, if there's a 4 in the left position or a 3 in the right position. Let's see.\n\nLooking at Example 0's first input row:\n\nPairs:\n\n(4,4), (0,3), (3,0)\n\nOutputs: 6,6,0.\n\nSo for each pair:\n\nIf the first element is 4 \u2192 contribute to the first output element? Or maybe the left element in the pair is part of the first half, and the right is part of the second half. Alternatively, maybe each pair is (a, b) and the output is 6 if a is 4 or b is 3. Let's check:\n\nFor Example 0's first input row:\n\nPair (4,4): a is 4 \u2192 so 6. Output is 6.\n\nPair (0,3): b is 3 \u2192 so 6. Output 6.\n\nPair (3,0): a is 3, b is 0. Neither 4 nor 3. So 0. Output 0. That fits.\n\nLet's check another example to see if this rule works.\n\nTake Example 1's input:\n\nFirst row input: [4,0,4,3,3,0]\n\nPairs are (4,0), (4,3), (3,0).\n\nPair 1: a=4 \u2192 6.\n\nPair 2: a=4 \u21926. Also, b=3 \u21926.\n\nPair3: a=3 \u2192 not 4, b=0 \u2192 no. So output 0. But the output for this row is [6,6,6]. Wait, that contradicts. Because according to the rule, third pair would be 0, but the output is 6.\n\nHmm. So that rule doesn't hold.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is 6 if either element in the pair is a 4 or 3. So for a pair (a,b), if a is 4 or 3, or b is 4 or 3, then output 6. Let's check Example 0's first pair (4,4): yes \u21926. Second pair (0,3): yes \u21926. Third pair (3,0): yes (3 is present) \u2192 but output is 0. So this doesn't fit. So that's not the case.\n\nHmm. Let's try looking at the output structure. Each output row has three elements, which suggests that each output element is derived from a pair of input elements, given that the input has six elements per row. So each output element is generated from two input elements.\n\nLooking at Example 0's first input row:\n\nInput: [4,4,0,3,3,0]\n\nOutput: [6,6,0]\n\nSo the first two elements (4,4) become 6, next two (0,3) become 6, next two (3,0) become 0.\n\nWhat's special about (3,0) here? Both are 3 and 0. Wait, but in the output it's 0. But in the second pair (0,3) the output is 6.\n\nSo perhaps the order matters. Let's think: if the first element of the pair is 4 and the second is 3, then 6? Or maybe if the pair contains both 4 and 3.\n\nWait, in the first pair (4,4), there's no 3. Second pair (0,3) has a 3. Third pair (3,0) has a 3. So maybe if a pair has any 4 or 3, then 6. But why the third pair gives 0 then? That can't be.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the sum of the pair must be 7 (4+3) to get 6. Let's check:\n\n(4,4) sum 8 \u2192 output 6. (0,3) sum 3 \u2192 output 6. (3,0) sum 3 \u2192 output 0. Doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, count the number of non-zero elements in the pair. For example:\n\nPair (4,4): 2 non-zero \u2192 6. Pair (0,3): 1 \u21926. Pair (3,0):1 \u21920. Hmm, that doesn't add up. So maybe that's not it.\n\nWait, looking at the output in Example 0's third row:\n\nInput is [0,0,0,0,0,3]. Split into pairs (0,0), (0,0), (0,3). Output is [0,0,6]. So the third pair (0,3) gives 6. So maybe when the pair has a 3 in the second position, it's 6. But in Example 0's first row, the third pair is (3,0), which gives 0. So if the second element is 3, output is 6. If first element is 4, output 6. Wait, for the first pair in Example 0, (4,4) \u2192 first element is 4 \u2192 output 6. Second pair (0,3) \u2192 second element is 3 \u2192 output 6. Third pair (3,0) \u2192 first element is 3, but not 4 \u2192 output 0. So the rule could be: for each pair, if the first element is 4 OR the second element is 3, then output 6; else 0. Let's test this.\n\nExample 0's first input row:\n\nPairs:\n\n(4,4) \u2192 4 in first \u21926.\n\n(0,3) \u21923 in second \u21926.\n\n(3,0) \u2192 neither \u21920. Output matches.\n\nExample 0's third input row is [0,0,0,0,0,3]. Pairs (0,0), (0,0), (0,3). Third pair: 3 in second \u21926. So output third element is 6. Which matches.\n\nNow check Example 1's first input row: [4,0,4,3,3,0]. Pairs (4,0), (4,3), (3,0).\n\nFirst pair: first element is 4 \u21926.\n\nSecond pair: first is 4 \u21926, and second is 3 \u21926. So output 6.\n\nThird pair: first is 3 \u2192 not 4, second is 0 \u2192 no. So output 0. But the actual output for Example 1's first row is [6,6,6]. So this contradicts. Hmm. So this rule would predict the third element as 0, but the actual output is 6. So this must be incorrect.\n\nWait, let's look at Example 1's input first row:\n\nInput row: [4,0,4,3,3,0]\n\nSplit into pairs: (4,0), (4,3), (3,0)\n\nAccording to the previous rule, the third pair (3,0) \u2192 neither 4 nor 3 in second \u2192 0. But output is 6. So that's a problem. So maybe the rule is different.\n\nAlternative approach: Let's think about the transformation in terms of combining elements. The output has three elements for each row, each corresponding to two elements in the input. So each output element is derived from a pair of input elements. Let's see:\n\nIn Example 0's output first row: [6,6,0]. Input pairs are (4,4), (0,3), (3,0).\n\nLooking for a pattern where each pair contributes to 6. Maybe whenever the pair has at least one 4 and at least one 3, but that doesn't fit. Let's see:\n\nFor (4,4), there are two 4s. Maybe sum them as 4+4=8, but 8 mod 7 is 1? Not sure. Or perhaps 4 and 3 are converted to 3 each, then sum. 4 becomes 3, so 3+3=6. Then 0 and 3 becomes 0 +3=3. But output is 6. So that doesn't work.\n\nWait, in Example 0's first pair (4,4) \u2192 output 6. If each 4 is 3, sum is 6. Then (0,3) sum 0+3=3 \u2192 output 6. So that doesn't fit. Unless 3 is multiplied by 2. Or perhaps each occurrence of 4 or 3 in the pair contributes 3 to the output. So if there's a 4 and a 3, sum 3+3=6. But in the first pair, two 4s would be 3+3=6. In the second pair (0,3) \u2192 3 \u2192 but output is 6, so maybe count the number of non-zero elements. If a pair has two non-zero elements (both 4s, or 4 and3), then 6. If only one non-zero, 6. If none, 0.\n\nWait, in Example 0's first pair: two non-zero (4s) \u21926. Second pair: one non-zero (3) \u21926. Third pair: one non-zero (3) \u21920. That's inconsistent.\n\nAlternatively, the sum of the pair in a different way. For example, 4 and 3 are considered as 3 each. So 4 becomes 3, 3 becomes 3. Then pair sum:\n\n(4,4) \u21923+3=6 \u21926.\n\n(0,3) \u21920+3=3 \u2192 but output is 6. So that's not it.\n\nAlternatively, if the pair contains any 4 or 3, then 6. But in the third pair of Example 0's first row, (3,0) has a 3 \u2192 output 0. So that's not the case.\n\nHmm. Let's look at Example 1's output first row: [6,6,6]. The pairs are (4,0), (4,3), (3,0). All three output elements are 6. According to the previous possible rules, the third pair (3,0) would have a 3 in first position, which isn't 4, and second position 0. So why is the output 6 here?\n\nWait, maybe the rule is that each pair contributes 6 if there is at least one 4 in the pair, or a 3 in the pair. Let's see:\n\nFor Example 0's first row:\n\nPair (4,4) \u2192 has 4s \u21926.\n\nPair (0,3) \u2192 has 3 \u21926.\n\nPair (3,0) \u2192 has 3 \u21926. But the output for this pair is 0. So that contradicts.\n\nAlternatively, if a pair has a 4 in the first position OR a 3 in the second position. Let's check.\n\nExample 0's first row:\n\n(4,4): first is 4 \u21926.\n\n(0,3): second is3 \u21926.\n\n(3,0): first is3 (not 4), second is0 \u2192 no. So output 0. Correct.\n\nExample 1's first row:\n\n(4,0): first is4 \u21926.\n\n(4,3): first is4 \u21926.\n\n(3,0): first is3 \u2192 no. So third output should be 0. But the actual output is 6. So this rule also fails.\n\nHmm. Maybe the rule is that each pair's output is 6 if either of the elements is 4 or 3, but only if they are in specific positions. For example, first element is 4, or second element is3, but also if the other element is non-zero? Not sure.\n\nAlternative approach: look for the transformation of each input row to output row by grouping elements. For instance, maybe each output element is the sum of the first two input elements, then next two, then next two, but with some modification.\n\nWait, let's compute sums for Example 0's first input row:\n\n4+4=8 \u21926.\n\n0+3=3 \u21926.\n\n3+0=3 \u21920.\n\nHmm, how 8 becomes6, 3 becomes6, and 3 becomes0. Doesn't make sense.\n\nAlternatively, count the number of 4s and 3s in each pair. For example:\n\nIn pair (4,4), two 4s \u2192 2*3=6.\n\nPair (0,3): one 3 \u21921*6=6.\n\nPair (3,0): one 3 \u21921*0=0. That's not consistent.\n\nWait, maybe each 4 and 3 in the pair is converted to 3, and sum them. So:\n\nPair (4,4): 3+3=6 \u21926.\n\nPair (0,3):0+3=3 \u2192 but output is6. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, if the pair contains a 4 and a 3, sum them to 7, but output is 6. But how?\n\nThis is getting complicated. Let's look at another example.\n\nExample 2's input:\n\nFirst row: [0,0,4,0,3,0]\n\nSplit into pairs: (0,0), (4,0), (3,0). Output row is [0,6,6]. So:\n\nPair (0,0) \u21920.\n\nPair (4,0) \u21926.\n\nPair (3,0) \u21926.\n\nBut according to earlier possible rules, like 4 in first position or 3 in second. For pair (4,0), first is4 \u21926. Pair (3,0), first is3 \u2192 no. So why output 6 here?\n\nHmm, this suggests that the rule is different. Maybe when there's a 4 or 3 in the pair, regardless of position. But in this case, (3,0) has a 3, so output 6. So the output for that pair is 6. But in Example 0's third pair (3,0) gives 0. So that's conflicting.\n\nWait, perhaps the output is 6 if there's at least one 4 or 3 in the pair, but only if the pair is not in a certain position. This seems too vague.\n\nAlternative approach: Let's think of the input rows as two separate groups. Maybe the first three elements and the last three elements are processed differently. For example, sum the first three and the last three, then combine them. But Example 0's first input row: first three sum to 4+4+0=8, last three 3+3+0=6. Output is [6,6,0]. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the output elements are the sum of the first two, middle two, and last two elements. But for Example 0's first input row:\n\nFirst two:4+4=8 \u21926.\n\nMiddle two:0+3=3 \u21926.\n\nLast two:3+0=3 \u21920.\n\nAgain, not sure how 8 becomes6, 3 becomes6, 3 becomes0.\n\nMaybe there's a modulo operation. 8 mod 6 = 2, not 6. 3 mod6=3, not 6. So that's not it.\n\nAlternative idea: each pair is replaced by 6 if there's a 4 or 3 in both positions. For example:\n\nPair (4,4): both are 4 \u21926.\n\nPair (0,3): one is3 \u21926.\n\nPair (3,0): one is3 \u21926. But Example 0's third pair outputs 0. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, the pair is replaced by 6 if there are any non-zero elements. But in Example 0's third pair (3,0) is non-zero, but output is0. So no.\n\nWait, maybe the output is 6 if the pair contains a 4 and a 3. Let's check:\n\nExample 0's first pair (4,4): no 3 \u2192 output6. So no.\n\nAnother approach: let's look at all the output rows. They all consist of 0s and 6s. The inputs have 0,4,3. So perhaps the output is 6 whenever the sum of 4s and 3s in the pair is >=1, but then why in some cases it's 0.\n\nAlternatively, each 4 and 3 is converted to 3, and then summed. So for a pair (4,4):3+3=6. Pair (0,3):0+3=3 \u2192 but output is6. So that's not matching.\n\nAnother idea: maybe the pairs are treated as binary flags. If the pair contains a 4, then it contributes 3 to the output. If it contains a 3, contributes another 3. So total 6 if both are present, 3 if only one. But output is either 0 or6. So perhaps if there's at least one 4 and at least one3 in the pair, sum to 6. Otherwise 0.\n\nBut in Example 0's first pair (4,4): two 4s \u2192 no 3. Output is6. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, if a pair contains both a 4 and a 3, then output6. Otherwise, 0. But in Example0's first pair (4,4) \u2192 no 3 \u2192 output6. So this can't be.\n\nWait, what if 4 and 3 are treated as representing different bits, and their combination in the pair leads to 6. For example, 4 is 3 in binary, 3 is also 3. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, think of 4 and 3 as parts of a code where 4 +3=7, but 7 mod 6=1. Doesn't help.\n\nAlternatively, the output is 6 for each pair where the sum is greater than or equal to 4. Let's check:\n\nExample0's first pair sum 8 \u21926.\n\nSecond pair sum3 \u2192 which is <4, but output6. Doesn't fit.\n\nThis is getting frustrating. Let's try to find another angle. Let's look at the inputs and outputs for each row and see if there's a pattern in the positions where 6 appears.\n\nIn Example0's first output row: [6,6,0]. The input pairs are (4,4), (0,3), (3,0). So the first two pairs contribute 6, the third doesn't.\n\nIn Example1's first output row: [6,6,6]. The input pairs are (4,0), (4,3), (3,0). All three pairs contribute 6.\n\nWait, but according to earlier attempts, what's common in these pairs that result in 6?\n\nFor Example1's third pair (3,0), why does it output 6? The input pair is (3,0). Maybe the presence of 3 in any position makes it 6. Let's check Example0's third pair (3,0): output 0. So that contradicts.\n\nWait, maybe it's the sum of the positions of non-zero elements. For example, 4 is in the first three elements and 3 is in the last three. So maybe each output element is the sum of a 4 from the first part and a 3 from the second part. Let's think:\n\nEach row in the input has six elements. The first three could be \"left\" and the last three \"right\". Each output element is formed by combining left and right elements in some way.\n\nFor example, first output element is left[0] + right[0], second is left[1] + right[1], third is left[2] + right[2]. But 4 and 3 would sum to7, which is not 6. Unless 4 is replaced with 3. So 3+3=6.\n\nWait, perhaps that's it! Let's try:\n\nFor each element in the input, replace 4 with 3 and 3 with 3 (no change). Then, group the first three elements as left and the last three as right. Then, each output element is left[i] + right[i]. For example:\n\nExample0's first input row: [4,4,0,3,3,0]. Replace with [3,3,0,3,3,0]. Left: [3,3,0], right: [3,3,0]. Then output elements are 3+3=6, 3+3=6, 0+0=0. Which matches the output [6,6,0]. \n\nExample0's third input row: [0,0,0,0,0,3]. Replace with [0,0,0,0,0,3]. Left: [0,0,0], right: [0,0,3]. Output: 0+0=0, 0+0=0, 0+3=3. But the actual output is [0,0,6]. So this doesn't fit. So this approach is invalid.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the left and right are paired in a different way. For example, the first element of left and first of right make a pair. Wait, but that's what I tried before.\n\nWait, let's check Example0's third input row again. Input is [0,0,0,0,0,3]. Replace 4s with3, 3s with3. So it becomes [0,0,0,0,0,3]. Left: [0,0,0], right: [0,0,3]. Then output would be [0+0=0, 0+0=0, 0+3=3]. But actual output is [0,0,6]. So 3 becomes6. So this approach is not correct.\n\nHmm. What if instead of summing, we multiply? 3*3=9, but output is6. No. Or take the count of non-zero elements. For Example0's first row:\n\nLeft [3,3,0] and right [3,3,0]. Each pair has (3,3), (3,3), (0,0). The count of non-zero in each is 2,2,0. Multiply by 3 gives 6,6,0. Which matches the output. \n\nWait, this seems to fit. Let's check:\n\nFor each position i (0,1,2) in the left and right parts:\n\nCount the number of non-zero elements in left[i] and right[i]. Multiply by 3 to get the output.\n\nIn Example0's first input row:\n\nLeft: [4,4,0] \u2192 replaced to [3,3,0]\n\nRight: [3,3,0] \u2192 [3,3,0]\n\nFor each position i:\n\ni=0: left[i]=3, right[i]=3 \u2192 both non-zero \u2192 count 2 \u2192 2*3=6.\n\ni=1: left[i]=3, right[i]=3 \u2192 count 2 \u21926.\n\ni=2: left[i]=0, right[i]=0 \u2192 count 0 \u21920.\n\nOutput [6,6,0]. Correct.\n\nExample0's third input row:\n\nInput: [0,0,0,0,0,3]\n\nLeft: [0,0,0], right: [0,0,3].\n\ni=0: 0 and 0 \u2192 count 0 \u21920.\n\ni=1:0 and0 \u21920.\n\ni=2:0 and3 \u2192 count 1 \u21921*3=3. But output is6. So this doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. So this approach works for some examples but not all. Let's check another example.\n\nExample1's first input row: [4,0,4,3,3,0]\n\nReplace 4s with3, 3s with3. Left: [3,0,3], right: [3,3,0].\n\nFor each i:\n\ni=0:3 and3 \u2192 count 2 \u21926.\n\ni=1:0 and3 \u2192 count1 \u21923.\n\ni=2:3 and0 \u2192 count1 \u21923.\n\nBut the output is [6,6,6]. So according to this, output should be [6,3,3], which is not the case. So this is incorrect.\n\nSo perhaps the approach isn't replacing 4s and3s with 3.\n\nAlternative idea: instead of replacing, maybe 4 and3 are counted as 3 each, and 0 as 0. Then for each pair in the input (two elements), sum them. But:\n\nExample0's first pair (4,4) \u21923+3=6. Output 6.\n\nSecond pair (0,3) \u21920+3=3 \u2192 output6. No. So that doesn't fit.\n\nWait, maybe the pair's sum is multiplied by something. Like (4+4)*0.75=6. (0+3)*2=6. But this seems arbitrary.\n\nAlternative approach: Let's look at the entire input and output matrices. For example, in Example0's input:\n\nInput rows:\n\n[4,4,0,3,3,0]\n\n[4,0,0,3,0,0]\n\n[0,0,0,0,0,3]\n\nOutput rows:\n\n[6,6,0]\n\n[6,0,0]\n\n[0,0,6]\n\nNotice that the output is a 3x3 matrix. Each output row has three elements. The input is also three rows, each with six elements. Maybe the output is formed by combining the input rows in some way. For example, each output cell is derived from corresponding cells in the input rows.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is the sum of the three input rows' elements, but processed. Let's see:\n\nExample0's output first element is6. Input first elements are4,4,0. Sum is8. But 8\u21926. Not sure.\n\nAnother idea: The output is formed by taking each row and processing each pair of elements (two from the same row) to form the output elements. So for each row, the six elements are grouped into three pairs, each pair contributes to an output element.\n\nWe need to find what transformation is applied to each pair to get the output.\n\nLooking at Example0's first input row:\n\nPairs: (4,4), (0,3), (3,0)\n\nOutput:6,6,0.\n\nWhat's the relation between the pair and output.\n\nLooking at another example. Example1's first input row:\n\nPairs: (4,0), (4,3), (3,0)\n\nOutput:6,6,6.\n\nHmm. So the third pair (3,0) gives 6 here, but in Example0's third pair (3,0), it gives 0.\n\nThis inconsistency suggests that the pair's position in the row matters. Like, maybe the first pair is processed differently from the third pair.\n\nAlternatively, the transformation depends on the column. Let's think of the input rows as matrices. For example, each row is a 3x2 matrix, and the output is a 3x1 matrix where each element is derived from the corresponding row in the input matrix.\n\nFor example, each output element is 6 if there are two 4s in the first pair, a 4 and 3 in the second pair, etc. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, think of the input rows as two columns of three elements each. Like:\n\nFirst column: [4,4,0]\n\nSecond column: [4,0,0]\n\nThird column: [0,3,0]\n\nFourth column: [3,3,0]\n\nWait, but this might not help.\n\nAnother approach: Let's consider that the output for each row is determined by the number of 4s and 3s in specific positions. For example, each output element corresponds to a column in the input when split into three columns of two elements each. Then, if a column contains both 4 and 3, output 6. Or another condition.\n\nAlternatively, for each output element, if in the corresponding two input elements there's a 4 in the first and a 3 in the second, then 6. Otherwise 0.\n\nFor Example0's first output element, the pair is (4,4) \u2192 no 3 in second, so 0. But output is6. So that's not it.\n\nAlternatively, if the pair has a 4 and a 3 in any order, output 6. But in Example0's first pair (4,4), no 3 \u2192 output6. So no.\n\nWait, perhaps each pair is mapped to 6 if there's at least one 4 and/or 3. But how to explain Example0's third pair (3,0) \u2192 output0.\n\nThis is really challenging. Let's try to find another pattern.\n\nLooking at Example4's input and output:\n\nInput row0: [0,0,0,0,3,0]\n\nOutput row0: [0,6,0]\n\nInput row0 pairs: (0,0), (0,3), (0,0)\n\nOutput: 0,6,0.\n\nSo, the middle pair (0,3) gives 6.\n\nExample4's third input row: [0,0,4,3,3,0]\n\nPairs: (0,0), (4,3), (3,0)\n\nOutput:6,6,6.\n\nSo, the first pair (0,0) gives 0 in row0, but in row3, the third pair (3,0) gives6.\n\nThis inconsistency suggests that the rule isn't uniform across all pairs.\n\nWait, perhaps the output is 6 if the sum of the pair is 4+3=7. But in Example0's first pair (4,4) sum is8. Output6. Example0's second pair (0,3) sum3 \u2192 output6. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAnother idea: Perhaps the output is 6 whenever a pair contains either a 4 or a 3, but only if there are exactly two such pairs per row. No, in Example0's output first row has two 6s, but Example1's first row has three.\n\nAlternatively, the output is 6 for each pair where either the first element is 4 or the second is3. Let's re-examine all examples with this rule.\n\nExample0's first input row:\n\nPairs:\n\n(4,4): first is4 \u21926.\n\n(0,3): second is3 \u21926.\n\n(3,0): neither \u21920. Output matches.\n\nExample1's first input row:\n\nPairs:\n\n(4,0): first is4 \u21926.\n\n(4,3): first is4 \u21926.\n\n(3,0): neither (3 is not 4, second is0) \u21920. But output is6 for third element. Contradiction.\n\nSo this rule doesn't work for Example1.\n\nExample2's input row0: [0,0,4,0,3,0]\n\nPairs: (0,0), (4,0), (3,0).\n\nOutput row0: [0,6,6].\n\nAccording to the rule:\n\nPair0: neither \u21920.\n\nPair1: first is4 \u21926.\n\nPair2: first is3 \u2192 no. So output should be [0,6,0], but actual output is [0,6,6]. So this is wrong.\n\nHmm. Maybe the rule is that the output is 6 if either element is 4 or 3, regardless of position. So:\n\nExample0's first row pairs:\n\n(4,4) \u2192 both are4 \u21926.\n\n(0,3) \u2192 has3 \u21926.\n\n(3,0) \u2192 has3 \u21926. But output is0. So no.\n\nThis doesn't fit.\n\nAnother angle: the outputs are all multiples of 6. Maybe each 4 and 3 contribute 3 to the output, and each pair sums their contributions. For example:\n\n4 \u21923, 3\u21923, 0\u21920.\n\nSo pair (4,4) \u21923+3=6.\n\nPair (0,3) \u21920+3=3 \u2192 but output is6. So no.\n\nBut if we take the count of non-zero elements in the pair and multiply by 3:\n\nExample0's first pair (4,4) \u2192 count2 \u21926.\n\nPair (0,3) \u2192count1 \u21923.\n\nBut output is6. So no.\n\nAlternatively, if any non-zero in the pair, output6. So:\n\nExample0's first pair (4,4) \u2192 non-zero \u21926.\n\nPair (0,3) \u2192 non-zero \u21926.\n\nPair (3,0) \u2192 non-zero \u21926. But output is0. Contradiction.\n\nThis is really confusing. Let's try to see if there's a pattern based on the training examples.\n\nLooking at Example0's output:\n\nInput rows:\n\nRow0: [4,4,0,3,3,0]\n\nRow1: [4,0,0,3,0,0]\n\nRow2: [0,0,0,0,0,3]\n\nOutput rows:\n\nRow0: [6,6,0]\n\nRow1: [6,0,0]\n\nRow2: [0,0,6]\n\nNotice that in the first output row, the first two elements are6, third is0. The input's first row has 4s and 3s in the first four elements. \n\nExample1's input:\n\nRow0: [4,0,4,3,3,0]\n\nRow1: [4,0,0,3,0,0]\n\nRow2: [0,0,4,3,0,0]\n\nOutput rows:\n\nRow0: [6,6,6]\n\nRow1: [6,0,0]\n\nRow2: [6,0,6]\n\nIt seems that when there's a 4 and a3 in adjacent positions, the output is6. But I'm not sure.\n\nAnother approach: Maybe the output is generated by combining elements from the same position across all three input rows. For example, the first output element is derived from the first elements of all three input rows. But this seems unlikely since the output rows correspond to each input row.\n\nWait, but each input has three rows, and the output also has three rows. So each input row maps to an output row. So we need to find how each individual row is transformed.\n\nLet me think of another possible rule. For each input row, split into three pairs of two elements each. For each pair, if the pair contains a4 and a3 in any order, output6. Otherwise, count the number of non-zero elements and multiply by3.\n\nFor example, Example0's first input row:\n\nPairs: (4,4) \u2192 no 3 \u2192 2 non-zero \u21926.\n\n(0,3) \u2192 no4 \u2192 1 non-zero \u21923, but output is6. So no.\n\nAlternatively, if a pair contains both 4 and3, output6. Otherwise, output0. But in Example0's first pair (4,4) \u2192 no3 \u2192 output6. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAnother idea: The output for each pair is6 if the pair contains any 4s or3s, but only if there's an even number of non-zero elements in the pair. Or something like that. Not sure.\n\nAt this point, I'm stuck. Maybe I should look for a different pattern.\n\nLet me consider the possibility that the output is a binary matrix where each element is 6 if there's a certain condition, else 0. For example, each pair in the input row is transformed into 6 if there's a 4 in the first element or a3 in the second element of the pair. But this doesn't explain all cases.\n\nLooking back at the test input:\n\nTest Input:\n\n[0,4,4,3,0,0]\n\n[4,0,0,3,3,0]\n\n[0,4,0,3,0,0]\n\nWe need to apply the pattern to get the output.\n\nLet me try to see what the pattern might be by applying a possible rule.\n\nAssuming the output for each pair is 6 if the pair has a 4 in the first element or a3 in the second. Let's test this on the test input.\n\nTest Input Row0: [0,4,4,3,0,0]\n\nSplit into pairs:\n\n(0,4), (4,3), (0,0).\n\nFor each pair:\n\n(0,4): first element is0 \u2192 no. Second element is4 \u2192 not3. So output0.\n\n(4,3): first is4 \u2192 yes \u21926.\n\n(0,0): no \u21920.\n\nSo output row0 would be [0,6,0].\n\nTest Input Row1: [4,0,0,3,3,0]\n\nPairs: (4,0), (0,3), (3,0).\n\n(4,0): first is4 \u21926.\n\n(0,3): second is3 \u21926.\n\n(3,0): first is3 \u2192 no. So output [6,6,0].\n\nTest Input Row2: [0,4,0,3,0,0]\n\nPairs: (0,4), (0,3), (0,0).\n\n(0,4): no. (0,3): second is3 \u21926. (0,0): no. So output [0,6,0].\n\nBut according to the training examples, this might not be correct. For example, in Example3's output:\n\nInput row0: [4,4,0,3,0,0]\n\nPairs: (4,4) \u21926, (0,3) \u21926, (0,0) \u21920. Output [6,6,0]. Which fits the rule.\n\nExample3's input row2: [4,0,0,0,0,0] \u2192 pairs (4,0), (0,0), (0,0). Output row2 is [6,0,0]. Which fits: first pair has4\u21926, others 0.\n\nBut earlier examples like Example1's third pair (3,0) would output0, but in Example1's output third element is6. So this rule isn't consistent.\n\nWait, Example1's third pair (3,0):\n\nAccording to the rule, since first element is3 (not4) and second is0 (not3), output0. But actual output is6. So this rule is invalid.\n\nThus, this approach is incorrect.\n\nAnother idea: The output is 6 if the pair contains a 4 in the first position or a3 in the second position, but only for the first and third pairs. For the second pair, perhaps it's different. This seems too arbitrary.\n\nAlternatively, each pair's output is 6 if the sum of the pair is divisible by 3. For example:\n\nPair (4,4): 8 \u21928%3=2 \u2192 no.\n\nBut output is6. So no.\n\nAnother thought: Perhaps the output is determined by the sum of the row's elements. But Example0's first input row sum is4+4+0+3+3+0=14. Output sum is12. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the output is the sum of each pair multiplied by 1.5. For example, 4+4=8 \u21928*0.75=6. 0+3=3 \u21923*2=6. 3+0=3 \u21923*0=0. But this seems arbitrary.\n\nAt this point, I think I need to consider that each pair in the input is converted to 6 if there's at least one 4 or 3 in the pair, but in certain positions or combinations. But given the time I've spent and not finding a clear pattern, perhaps I should look for a different approach.\n\nLet me look at all the outputs again and see if there's a connection between the input and output rows.\n\nFor Example0's input:\n\nRow0: [4,4,0,3,3,0]\n\nRow1: [4,0,0,3,0,0]\n\nRow2: [0,0,0,0,0,3]\n\nOutput rows:\n\nRow0: [6,6,0]\n\nRow1: [6,0,0]\n\nRow2: [0,0,6]\n\nNotice that in the output, each 6 corresponds to the presence of 4s and 3s in certain positions. For instance, in output row0, the first two elements are6, which might correspond to the 4s in the first two pairs and the 3s in the third pair of the input row0. But I'm not sure.\n\nAnother observation: The outputs often have 6s where there are 4s and3s in the input. For example, in Example1's input row0, there are 4s and3s in all pairs except perhaps the third, but output is all6s. This suggests that perhaps the output is 6 if any of the elements in the pair is non-zero (since 4 and3 are non-zero). But in Example0's third pair (3,0), it's non-zero but output is0. So that's not it.\n\nWait, but maybe the output is 6 if the pair contains at least one non-zero element, but only if the sum is even or something. No, in Example0's third pair sum is3, which is odd. Output is0. But in Example1's third pair sum is3, which is odd, but output is6. So that's not it.\n\nAnother possibility: The output is 6 for each pair where the product of the elements is non-zero. For Example0's first pair (4,4) \u2192 product 16 \u2192 non-zero \u21926. Second pair (0,3) \u21920 \u21920. But output is6. So this is incorrect.\n\nThis is really challenging. I think I need to try to find another approach, perhaps by looking at the test input and see what the output would be based on previous examples.\n\nTest Input:\n\nRow0: [0,4,4,3,0,0]\n\nRow1: [4,0,0,3,3,0]\n\nRow2: [0,4,0,3,0,0]\n\nLet's split into pairs:\n\nRow0: (0,4), (4,3), (0,0)\n\nRow1: (4,0), (0,3), (3,0)\n\nRow2: (0,4), (0,3), (0,0)\n\nNow, looking for a pattern from training examples. For instance, in Example3's output row0:\n\nInput: [4,4,0,3,0,0] \u2192 pairs (4,4), (0,3), (0,0) \u2192 output [6,6,0]. So first two pairs are 6, third 0. So for the first pair (4,4) \u21926, second pair (0,3) \u21926, third 0.\n\nTest row0's pairs are (0,4), (4,3), (0,0). If the rule is first element is4 or second is3:\n\nPair0: first is0, second is4 \u2192 not3 \u21920.\n\nPair1: first is4 \u21926.\n\nPair2: both 0 \u21920.\n\nSo row0's output would be [0,6,0].\n\nTest row1's pairs: (4,0) \u21924 in first \u21926. (0,3) \u21923 in second \u21926. (3,0) \u21923 in first \u2192 not4, second 0 \u21920. So output [6,6,0].\n\nTest row2's pairs: (0,4) \u2192second is4 \u2192 not3 \u21920. (0,3) \u2192 second is3 \u21926. (0,0) \u21920. So output [0,6,0].\n\nBut looking at training examples, for example, Example1's output for a pair with (3,0) gives6. So this rule doesn't account for that. So perhaps the rule is different.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is 6 if the pair contains a4 in the first position or a3 in the second, but also if there's a3 in the first position and a4 in the second. But I'm not sure.\n\nLooking at Example1's input row0: (4,0), (4,3), (3,0). Output is [6,6,6]. According to the previous rule, the third pair (3,0) would output0, but it outputs6. So this contradicts.\n\nSo another possibility is that the output is 6 if either element is4 or3, regardless of position. So for any pair containing4 or3, output6. Let's check:\n\nExample0's first row:\n\nPairs (4,4) \u2192 yes \u21926.\n\n(0,3) \u2192 yes \u21926.\n\n(3,0) \u2192 yes \u21926. But output is0. So no.\n\nThus, this is not the case.\n\nGiven that I'm struggling to find the pattern, perhaps I should look for a different approach. Maybe the output is a matrix where each element is 6 if the corresponding input pair has a non-zero element in any of the three rows. But this seems unlikely as each output row corresponds to a single input row.\n\nAnother idea: The output is formed by taking the first three elements of the input and the last three elements, and combining them in a certain way. For example, each output element is the sum of the corresponding elements in the first three and last three. But again, this needs to be checked.\n\nFor Example0's input row0:\n\nFirst three elements: [4,4,0]\n\nLast three: [3,3,0]\n\nSum each pair:\n\n4+3=7 \u21926.\n\n4+3=7 \u21926.\n\n0+0=0 \u21920.\n\nOutput is [6,6,0]. Which matches. This seems promising.\n\nSo the pattern could be: split each input row into first three and last three elements. Then, for each position i (0,1,2), sum the ith element of the first three and the ith element of the last three. Replace the sum with 6 if it's 7 (since 4+3=7) and 6, but how?\n\nWait, in Example0's first row:\n\n4 (first three) +3 (last three) =7 \u2192 output6.\n\n4+3=7 \u21926.\n\n0+0=0 \u21920.\n\nSo each sum of 7 becomes6, other sums are as is. But what about other sums.\n\nExample1's input row0:\n\nFirst three: [4,0,4]\n\nLast three: [3,3,0].\n\nSum each pair:\n\n4+3=7 \u21926.\n\n0+3=3 \u21926.\n\n4+0=4 \u21926.\n\nBut output is [6,6,6]. So this works if 7, 3, and4 all become6. So this can't be the case.\n\nAlternatively, if any sum that includes a 4 and a3, which sum to7, but other sums like 4+4=8 or 3+3=6 would need to be converted to6.\n\nBut this is speculative.\n\nAlternatively, each element in the first three is a 4, and each element in the last three is a3. So when summed, 4+3=7, which is converted to6. But if the elements are both4, like 4+4=8, how to get6. Maybe 8 mod 6 =2, but that doesn't give6.\n\nThis approach doesn't seem to fit all examples.\n\nAnother observation: All the output elements are multiples of 6. This suggests that the transformation involves multiplication by 6.\n\nLooking at Example3's input row0: [4,4,0,3,0,0]. First three:4,4,0. Last three:3,0,0. Sum per position:\n\n4+3=7 \u21926.\n\n4+0=4 \u21926.\n\n0+0=0 \u21920.\n\nOutput is [6,6,0]. So 7 and4 are both mapped to6. How?\n\nThis suggests that any sum greater than or equal to4 is mapped to6. But 4 would be mapped to6. 3 is mapped to6. Wait, but in Example0's second pair sum is0+3=3 \u2192 output6. So that would require that sums >=3 become6. But in Example0's third pair sum is3+0=3 \u2192 output0. Contradiction.\n\nThis is getting me nowhere. Given that I need to provide an answer, I'll have to make an educated guess based on the training examples.\n\nLooking at the test input:\n\nTest Input rows:\n\nRow0: [0,4,4,3,0,0] \u2192 pairs (0,4), (4,3), (0,0)\n\nRow1: [4,0,0,3,3,0] \u2192 pairs (4,0), (0,3), (3,0)\n\nRow2: [0,4,0,3,0,0] \u2192 pairs (0,4), (0,3), (0,0)\n\nLooking at similar training examples, like Example1's first row which has pairs (4,0), (4,3), (3,0) and output [6,6,6]. So in that case, all three pairs output6. So perhaps the rule is that if the pair contains any 4 or3, output6. But in Example0's third pair (3,0), output is0. So this can't be.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is6 if the pair contains a4 in the first element or a3 in the second. Let's apply this to the test input.\n\nTest Row0 pairs:\n\n(0,4): first not4, second not3 \u21920.\n\n(4,3): first is4 \u21926.\n\n(0,0): no \u21920.\n\nOutput row0: [0,6,0].\n\nTest Row1 pairs:\n\n(4,0): first is4 \u21926.\n\n(0,3): second is3 \u21926.\n\n(3,0): first is3 \u2192 no. \u21920.\n\nOutput row1: [6,6,0].\n\nTest Row2 pairs:\n\n(0,4): first not4 \u21920.\n\n(0,3): second is3 \u21926.\n\n(0,0): no \u21920.\n\nOutput row2: [0,6,0].\n\nBut looking at the training examples, for Example1's third pair (3,0), the output is6. According to this rule, it should be0. So there's a discrepancy. However, maybe the correct rule is that if the pair contains a4 or3 in any position, output6. Let's try that:\n\nTest Row0 pairs:\n\n(0,4) \u2192 has4 \u21926.\n\n(4,3) \u2192 has4 and3 \u21926.\n\n(0,0) \u2192 no \u21920.\n\nOutput row0: [6,6,0].\n\nTest Row1 pairs:\n\n(4,0) \u21924 \u21926.\n\n(0,3) \u21923 \u21926.\n\n(3,0) \u21923 \u21926.\n\nOutput row1: [6,6,6].\n\nTest Row2 pairs:\n\n(0,4) \u21924 \u21926.\n\n(0,3) \u21923 \u21926.\n\n(0,0) \u2192 no \u21920.\n\nOutput row2: [6,6,0].\n\nBut looking at the training examples, this would change some outputs. For example, Example0's third pair (3,0) has a3 \u2192 output should be6, but actual output is0. So this rule is incorrect.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and the possibility that the correct pattern is based on the first element of the pair being4 or the second being3, despite some inconsistencies in training examples, I'll proceed with that rule for the test input. This might not be accurate, but it's the best I can do given the time.\n\nSo applying the rule where each pair outputs6 if the first element is4 or the second is3:\n\nTest Row0 pairs:\n\n(0,4): first is0, second is4 \u2192 no \u21920.\n\n(4,3): first is4 \u21926.\n\n(0,0): no \u21920.\n\nOutput row0: [0,6,0].\n\nTest Row1 pairs:\n\n(4,0): first is4 \u21926.\n\n(0,3): second is3 \u21926.\n\n(3,0): first is3 \u2192 no \u21920.\n\nOutput row1: [6,6,0].\n\nTest Row2 pairs:\n\n(0,4): first is0 \u2192 no.\n\n(0,3): second is3 \u21926.\n\n(0,0): no \u21920.\n\nOutput row2: [0,6,0].\n\nBut looking at Example1's first row output, which has three 6s, this rule would predict [6,6,0], but the actual output is [6,6,6]. So this suggests the rule is incorrect. However, without a better alternative, I'll proceed.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a different rule for when the pair's first element is3. For example, if the first element is3 and the second is4, output6. But I'm not sure.\n\nAnother possibility: The output is6 if the sum of the pair is a multiple of 3. Let's check:\n\nTest Row0 pairs:\n\n0+4=4 \u2192 no.\n\n4+3=7 \u2192 no.\n\n0+0=0 \u2192 yes. So output [0,0,6]. But this doesn't match previous examples.\n\nThis is really challenging. Given the time constraints, I'll have to make an educated guess. Based on Example1's output where a pair with (3,0) outputs6, perhaps the rule is that the pair contains any 4 or3. So:\n\nTest Input:\n\nRow0: (0,4) \u21924 \u21926.\n\n(4,3) \u21924,3 \u21926.\n\n(0,0) \u21920.\n\nOutput row0: [6,6,0].\n\nRow1: (4,0) \u21924 \u21926.\n\n(0,3) \u21923 \u21926.\n\n(3,0) \u21923 \u21926.\n\nOutput row1: [6,6,6].\n\nRow2: (0,4) \u21924 \u21926.\n\n(0,3) \u21923 \u21926.\n\n(0,0) \u21920.\n\nOutput row2: [6,6,0].\n\nBut according to this, the output would be:\n\n[6,6,0]\n\n[6,6,6]\n\n[6,6,0]\n\nBut looking at the training examples, Example0's third pair (3,0) outputs0, which contradicts this rule. But Example1's third pair (3,0) outputs6. This inconsistency makes this rule invalid.\n\nGiven that I'm unable to discern the correct pattern, I'll have to make a guess based on the majority of examples. For instance, in many examples, if a pair contains a4 or3, the output is6. So applying that to the test input:\n\nTest Input:\n\nRow0: [0,4,4,3,0,0] \u2192 pairs (0,4), (4,3), (0,0). All pairs except last have 4 or3 \u2192 output [6,6,0].\n\nRow1: [4,0,0,3,3,0] \u2192 pairs (4,0), (0,3), (3,0). All pairs have 4 or3 \u2192 output [6,6,6].\n\nRow2: [0,4,0,3,0,0] \u2192 pairs (0,4), (0,3), (0,0). First two pairs have4 or3 \u2192 output [6,6,0].\n\nBut looking at the training examples, Example0's third pair (3,0) outputs0, which contradicts this rule. So I'm not confident.\n\nHowever, given the time I've spent and the need to provide an answer, I'll go with the following output based on the pairs containing 4 or3:\n\nTest Output:\n\n[6,6,0]\n\n[6,6,6]\n\n[6,6,0]\n\nBut looking at Example2's output, which has [0,6,6], [6,6,6], [6,6,6], this could vary. But without a clear pattern, I'm making a guess.",

        "cot_2": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. So, the inputs are lists of numbers, and the outputs are transformed versions of those. The goal is to see how each input list gets turned into the output. Let me look at the training examples one by one.\n\nStarting with Example 0. The input has three rows:\n\n[4, 4, 0, 3, 3, 0]\n[4, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0]\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3]\n\nThe output is:\n\n[6, 6, 0]\n[6, 0, 0]\n[0, 0, 6]\n\nHmm, so each input row is being split into two parts? Let's see. The input has 6 elements, and the output has 3. Maybe they're combining pairs of numbers. For the first input row, the first three pairs (4,4), (0,3), (3,0) \u2013 but wait, maybe each pair is summed? But 4+4=8, which isn't 6. So that's not it. Alternatively, maybe grouping every two elements and applying some operation.\n\nWait, the output for the first row in Example 0 is [6,6,0]. Let's check the first input row's elements. The first two elements are 4 and 4. Then next two are 0 and 3. Then 3 and 0. If we add them: 4+4=8, 0+3=3, 3+0=3. But output is 6,6,0. That doesn't match. Alternatively, maybe multiply? 4*4 is 16, which is way over. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps looking at non-zero elements. Let's see. The first input row has non-zero elements 4,4,3,3. The output is 6,6,0. 4+4=8, 3+3=6. Wait, maybe the sum of each group of two non-zero numbers? But how are they grouped? Or maybe the sum of each pair in the original input, but replacing the sum with 6 if it's a certain value. Let me check another example.\n\nTake Example 1. Input rows:\n\n[4, 0, 4, 3, 3, 0]\n[4, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0]\n[0, 0, 4, 3, 0, 0]\n\nOutputs:\n\n[6,6,6]\n[6,0,0]\n[6,0,6]\n\nLooking at the first input row: 4,0,4,3,3,0. So grouping into pairs: (4,0), (4,3), (3,0). Then the output is 6,6,6. Maybe each pair is summed if both are non-zero? Let's see: (4,0) has a 0, so maybe that's 0. But the output here is 6. Hmm. Alternatively, if the pair contains a 4 and 3, maybe adding them gives 7, which isn't 6. Wait, maybe 4 and 3 are being treated as 3 and 3? Not sure.\n\nWait, looking at Example 0's output, the first row's output [6,6,0]. The input pairs could be (4,4) summed to 8, but 8 is turned into 6. Maybe 4 and 4 sum to 8, which is reduced by 2? 8-2=6. Then 0 and 3 sum to 3, which would become 1? But output is 6. Doesn't fit. Alternatively, maybe if the numbers are 4 and 3, their sum is 7, but in the output, it's 6. Not sure.\n\nAnother angle: The output numbers are 0 or 6. So perhaps when there are certain combinations of numbers in the input pairs, they turn into 6, otherwise 0. Let's look at Example 0 again. The first input row has pairs (4,4), (0,3), (3,0). The output is 6,6,0. So the first two pairs become 6, the third becomes 0. Maybe the pairs that have two non-zero numbers? Let's check. (4,4) both non-zero: 6. (0,3): one is zero. But in Example 0's first output, the second element is 6, but the pair (0,3) has one zero. That doesn't fit. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe it's about the presence of 4s and 3s. Like, each 4 and 3 in the input is being converted to 3 and 3, and then summed. For example, 4 becomes 3, 3 becomes 3. So 4+4 would be 3+3=6. Then 0 and 3 would be 0+3=3, but output is 6. That doesn't fit. Alternatively, 4 and 3 are considered as 3 each. So any occurrence of 4 or 3 in a pair contributes 3. So for a pair with a 4 and a 3, sum to 3+3=6. But a pair with 4 and 0 would be 3+0=3. Wait, in Example 0's first input row, the first pair is 4 and 4. If each 4 is converted to 3, sum is 6. The second pair is 0 and 3. 0 becomes 0, 3 becomes 3: sum 3. But the output is 6 here. So that's conflicting. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each 4 and 3 in the input is counted as 1 each, and when their count in a pair reaches 2, it's converted to 6. For example, in Example 0's first pair (4,4): two 4s, which would be 2 counts, leading to 6. The next pair (0,3) has one 3, so maybe 3? But output is 6. Not matching.\n\nAnother approach: The output might be grouping the input into three groups of two elements each and summing each group, but with some transformation. Let's check:\n\nExample 0, first input row: [4,4,0,3,3,0]. Groups: (4,4), (0,3), (3,0). Sums: 8, 3, 3. Output is [6,6,0]. So 8 becomes 6, 3 becomes 6, 3 becomes 0. That's inconsistent. So perhaps the sum is mapped to 6 if it's 7 or 8? But 3 is mapped to 6 here, which doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each pair is transformed into 6 if it contains both a 4 and a 3, or two 4s, or two 3s. Let's see:\n\nIn Example 0's first pair (4,4): two 4s. Output 6. Second pair (0,3): 3. But output is 6. Third pair (3,0): 3, output 0. That's confusing.\n\nWait, maybe the position matters. Let's consider that the input has six elements, and the output has three. So each output element is a combination of two input elements. But how?\n\nLooking at Example 0's first output row [6,6,0]. The input row is [4,4,0,3,3,0]. Let's see:\n\nFirst output element 6: perhaps 4 +4 = 8, but 8 mod something? 8-2=6. Then next two elements 0 and 3: sum is 3, but output is 6. Then 3 and 0: sum 3, output 0. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, the first three elements of the input row and the last three. Wait, the input row has six elements. Maybe split into two halves and sum each half? Let's see for Example 0's first input row: first three elements 4,4,0 sum to 8. Last three 3,3,0 sum to 6. But output is [6,6,0]. Not matching. So that's not it.\n\nAlternatively, the output elements are formed by adding the first and fourth elements, the second and fifth, third and sixth. For Example 0's first input row: 4+3=7, 4+3=7, 0+0=0. Then output is 6,6,0. So 7 becomes 6. Maybe subtract 1? 7-1=6. Then 7-1=6, 0 remains 0. That could work. Let's check another example.\n\nTake Example 1's first input row: [4,0,4,3,3,0]. Applying the same approach: first and fourth elements 4+3=7, second and fifth 0+3=3, third and sixth 4+0=4. Then subtract 1 each: 6, 2, 3. But the output is [6,6,6]. Doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. Maybe a different combination. Maybe adding elements in positions 0 and 1, positions 2 and 3, positions 4 and 5. For Example 0's first row: (4+4)=8, (0+3)=3, (3+0)=3. Then output is 6,6,0. How does 8 become 6? 8 -2=6. 3 becomes 6? Maybe multiplied by 2? But 3*2=6, and then 3*0=0. But in Example 0's output, the third element is 0, which would correspond to 3. So 3 would be mapped to 0. That's inconsistent. Alternatively, if the sum is 6 or more, then it's 6. If sum is 3, it's 6. No, that doesn't make sense.\n\nAnother angle: The numbers 4 and 3 in the input. Maybe 4 and 3 are parts of a code where 4+3=7, but output is 6. Maybe each 4 and 3 pair is turned into 6. Let's see.\n\nIn Example 0's first input row: pairs (4,4), (0,3), (3,0). So the first pair is two 4s. Second pair has a 3. Third pair has a 3. How do these translate to 6,6,0?\n\nWait, maybe any group (a pair) that has at least one 4 and one 3 becomes 6. But in the first pair of Example 0's first row, there are two 4s. So maybe two 4s sum to 6. How? 4+4=8, but 8-2=6. Then if the pair is two 3s, 3+3=6. But if the pair has a 4 and a 3, 4+3=7, which becomes 6. Alternatively, maybe each 4 and 3 in the pair counts as 3 each. So 4 becomes 3, 3 becomes 3. Then (4,4) becomes 3+3=6. (0,3) becomes 0+3=3, but output is 6. Hmm, not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each occurrence of 4 or 3 in the pair contributes 3. So any 4 is 3, any 3 is 3. Then sum them. So for (4,4): 3+3=6. For (0,3): 0+3=3. For (3,0): 3+0=3. But in the output, those pairs are 6,6,0. So 3 and 3 would be 6? Wait, maybe if the sum is 3 or higher, it's 6. So any sum >=3 becomes 6. So (4,4) sum 8 \u21926, (0,3) sum 3 \u21926, (3,0) sum3\u21926. But Example 0's output third element is 0, which contradicts that. Hmm.\n\nThis is tricky. Let's try a different approach. Let's look at all the examples and see if there's a common theme.\n\nLooking at Example 0's input and output:\n\nInput rows:\n\nRow1: [4,4,0,3,3,0] \u2192 Output [6,6,0]\n\nRow2: [4,0,0,3,0,0] \u2192 [6,0,0]\n\nRow3: [0,0,0,0,0,3] \u2192 [0,0,6]\n\nSo for Row3, the input ends with a 3, and the output ends with 6. So perhaps the last element in the input's sixth position (3) becomes 6 in the third position of the output. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe each group of two elements in the input is converted into a single element in the output. For example, in Row3 of Example 0:\n\nInput: [0,0,0,0,0,3] \u2192 groups (0,0), (0,0), (0,3). Output is [0,0,6]. So (0,3) becomes 6. But how? Maybe if either element is 3, then 6. But in the first group (0,0), output 0. Second group (0,0) \u21920. Third (0,3) \u21926. So if a group has a 3, then 6. But then in Example 0's Row1, group (0,3) becomes 6. But in the third group (3,0) becomes 0. Wait, that's inconsistent. Because in Row1's third group (3,0), the output is 0. But according to this idea, any group with a 3 would be 6. So that doesn't fit.\n\nWait, maybe if the group has at least one 4 or 3, then it becomes 6. But in Example 0's Row1, the first group (4,4) \u21926, second (0,3) \u21926, third (3,0) \u21920. But the third group has 3 and 0. So why is it 0? That contradicts.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the sum of the two elements in the group is 7 (4+3), 8 (4+4), or 6 (3+3) becomes 6. So if the sum is >=6, it becomes 6, else 0. Let's check:\n\nRow1 Example0: groups sum to 8,3,3. So 8 becomes 6, 3 becomes 0. But output is 6,6,0. That doesn't fit. So sum >=6 would make 6. Then 8 is okay, but 3 would be 0. So why is the second group's sum 3 mapped to 6? That's a problem.\n\nAnother idea: Maybe each group of two elements is transformed into 6 if there's at least one 4 and one 3. But in Example0's first group (4,4) \u21926. So that's two 4s. Maybe any pair with non-zero elements (either 4 or 3) becomes 6. So if both elements are non-zero, output 6. If only one is non-zero, output 6 if it's a 3? Or 0? Let's see:\n\nRow1 Example0:\n\nGroup1: (4,4) \u2192 both non-zero \u21926.\n\nGroup2: (0,3) \u2192 one is zero, other is 3 \u21926.\n\nGroup3: (3,0) \u2192 one is zero, other is 3 \u21920. Hmm, but why the difference between group2 and group3? That's confusing. Maybe the order matters. Like, if the first element is 4 and the second is 3, or vice versa. But in group2 of Row1, it's 0 and 3. So maybe if the second element is 3, then 6. If the first is 3, then 0. That would fit for Row1: group2 (0,3) \u21926, group3 (3,0) \u21920. But then in Row3 of Example0, the group is (0,3) \u21926. So that would fit. Let's test another example.\n\nTake Example3's input:\n\nInput Row1: [4,4,0,3,0,0] \u2192 Output [6,6,0].\n\nGroups: (4,4) \u21926, (0,3) \u21926, (0,0) \u21920. That matches the output.\n\nRow2 Input: [0,0,0,0,0,3] \u2192 groups (0,0), (0,0), (0,3) \u2192 output [0,0,6]. So (0,3) \u21926.\n\nRow3 Input: [4,0,0,0,0,0] \u2192 groups (4,0), (0,0), (0,0) \u2192 output [6,0,0]. So (4,0) \u21926. Wait, according to the previous idea, if the group has a 4 in first position and 0, then 6? That contradicts. Because in Row3's group (4,0) \u21926. But according to the earlier pattern where only when the second element is 3, it's 6, this would be 0. But here it's 6. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the presence of a 4 in the first element of the pair makes it 6, regardless of the second. Or presence of a 3 in the second element.\n\nWait, let's re-examine the groups in Example3's Row3 input: (4,0) \u21926. So perhaps any group that has a 4 in the first position becomes 6. Then (4,4) is 6, (4,0) is 6. For groups where the second element is 3, like (0,3) \u21926. And if the group has a 3 in the first position and something else, like (3,0), then 0. So the rule could be:\n\nFor each group of two elements (a, b):\n\n- If a is 4 \u2192 output 6.\n\n- Else, if b is 3 \u2192 output 6.\n\n- Else, output 0.\n\nLet's test this hypothesis with Example0.\n\nExample0 Row1: groups (4,4) \u2192 a=4 \u21926; (0,3) \u2192 b=3 \u21926; (3,0) \u2192 a is not 4, b is not 3 \u21920. Output [6,6,0]. Correct.\n\nRow2: [4,0,0,3,0,0] \u2192 groups (4,0)\u21926; (0,3)\u21926; (0,0)\u21920. Output [6,0,0]. Wait, wait, that's not matching. Because according to the rule, (0,3) \u21926, but the output's second element is 0. Hmm, that's a problem.\n\nWait, Example0's Row2 input is [4,0,0,3,0,0]. So groups are (4,0), (0,3), (0,0). According to the rule, first group (4,0) \u21926, second (0,3) \u21926, third (0,0)\u21920. Output should be [6,6,0], but the actual output is [6,0,0]. So this contradicts. Therefore, the hypothesis is incorrect.\n\nHmm, maybe I need to re-examine that example.\n\nExample0's Row2 input: [4,0,0,3,0,0]. Output is [6,0,0]. According to the previous idea, the groups would be (4,0), (0,3), (0,0). The output should be [6,6,0], but actual output is [6,0,0]. So why is the second group 0?\n\nWait, maybe the group is (0,3) but the output is 0. So the rule isn't just based on a being 4 or b being 3. There's something else.\n\nLooking back, maybe the groups are not consecutive pairs. Maybe they are overlapping or in some other formation. Wait, the input has six elements, output three. So each output element corresponds to two input elements. But how?\n\nAlternative grouping: Maybe first two elements form the first group, then next two elements form the second, then last two form the third. That's the same as previous approach. Let's see Example0 Row2's input: [4,0,0,3,0,0]. Groups are (4,0), (0,3), (0,0). The output is [6,0,0]. According to previous rule, first group (4,0) \u21926, second (0,3) \u21926, third \u21920. Output should be [6,6,0], but actual is [6,0,0]. So that's a problem. Therefore, the rule must be different.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the first group is elements 0 and 3, the second group 1 and4, third group 2 and5. Let's check.\n\nIn Example0 Row1: input indices 0:4,1:4,2:0,3:3,4:3,5:0. Groups would be (4,3), (4,3), (0,0). Sums are 7,7,0. Output is [6,6,0]. So 7\u21926, 7\u21926, 0\u21920. Maybe subtract 1. But 7-1=6. 0 remains. That could fit. Let's test this in Example0 Row2.\n\nRow2 input: indices 0:4,1:0,2:0,3:3,4:0,5:0. Groups would be (4,3), (0,0), (0,0). Sums 7,0,0. Subtract 1 gives 6, -1 (which is 0?), 0. Output is [6,0,0]. Which matches. How about the third row of Example0: input is [0,0,0,0,0,3]. Groups (0,0), (0,0), (0,3). Sums 0,0,3. Subtract 1: -1 (0?), 0-1=-1 (0?), 2. But the output is [0,0,6]. So this doesn't fit.\n\nWait, maybe it's not subtraction. Maybe it's modulo 6? 7 mod 6 is 1, which doesn't help. Hmm.\n\nAlternative idea: For each pair of elements (i, i+3) in the input row. So for a row with 6 elements, group elements 0 and 3, 1 and4, 2 and5. Let's check Example0 Row1:\n\nRow1 input: [4,4,0,3,3,0]\n\nGroup0:4 and3 \u21927 \u21926\n\nGroup1:4 and3 \u21927 \u21926\n\nGroup2:0 and0 \u21920 \u21920\n\nOutput is [6,6,0]. That matches. For Row2:\n\nInput [4,0,0,3,0,0]\n\nGroup0:4 and3 \u21927\u21926\n\nGroup1:0 and0 \u21920\u21920\n\nGroup2:0 and0 \u21920\u21920\n\nOutput is [6,0,0]. Which matches. For Row3:\n\nInput [0,0,0,0,0,3]\n\nGroup0:0 and0 \u21920\u21920\n\nGroup1:0 and0 \u21920\u21920\n\nGroup2:0 and3 \u21923\u21926?\n\nSo 3 becomes 6. How? Maybe if the sum is non-zero, it becomes 6. So any sum that's >=1 becomes 6, else 0. So:\n\nSum of group elements:\n\nIf sum >0 \u21926, else 0.\n\nSo for group (0,3): sum 3 \u21926.\n\nGroup (4,3): sum7\u21926.\n\nGroup (0,0): sum0\u21920.\n\nThis seems to fit all examples.\n\nLet me check Example0:\n\nRow1 groups:4+3=7 \u21926, 4+3=7\u21926, 0+0=0\u21920. Output [6,6,0]. Correct.\n\nRow2:4+3=7\u21926, 0+0=0\u21920, 0+0=0\u21920. Output [6,0,0]. Correct.\n\nRow3:0+0=0\u21920,0+0=0\u21920,0+3=3\u21926. Output [0,0,6]. Correct.\n\nNow Example1:\n\nInput Row1: [4,0,4,3,3,0]\n\nGroups:\n\n4+3=7\u21926, 0+3=3\u21926, 4+0=4\u21926. Wait, sum of 4 and 3 is 7 \u21926. Sum of 0 and3 is3\u21926. Sum of4 and0 is4\u21926. So output [6,6,6]. Which matches the output.\n\nRow2 input [4,0,0,3,0,0]:\n\n4+3=7\u21926, 0+0=0\u21920, 0+0=0\u21920. Output [6,0,0]. Correct.\n\nRow3 input [0,0,4,3,0,0]:\n\n0+3=3\u21926,0+0=0\u21920,4+0=4\u21926. Output [6,0,6]. Which matches.\n\nExample2:\n\nInput Row1: [0,0,4,0,3,0]\n\nGroups:0+0=0\u21920,0+3=3\u21926,4+0=4\u21926. Output is [0,6,6]. Which matches.\n\nRow2 input [0,4,4,3,0,3]:\n\nGroups:0+3=3\u21926,4+0=4\u21926,4+3=7\u21926. Output [6,6,6]. Which matches.\n\nRow3 input [4,4,0,0,0,3]:\n\nGroups:4+0=4\u21926,4+0=4\u21926,0+3=3\u21926. Output [6,6,6]. Correct.\n\nExample3:\n\nRow1 input [4,4,0,3,0,0]:\n\nGroups:4+3=7\u21926,4+0=4\u21926,0+0=0\u21920. Output [6,6,0]. Correct.\n\nRow2 input [0,0,0,0,0,3]:\n\nGroups:0+0=0\u21920,0+0=0\u21920,0+3=3\u21926. Output [0,0,6]. Correct.\n\nRow3 input [4,0,0,0,0,0]:\n\nGroups:4+0=4\u21926,0+0=0\u21920,0+0=0\u21920. Output [6,0,0]. Correct.\n\nExample4:\n\nRow1 input [0,0,0,0,3,0]:\n\nGroups:0+0=0\u21920,0+3=3\u21926,0+0=0\u21920. Output [0,6,0]. Correct.\n\nRow2 input [4,0,0,0,0,0]:\n\nGroups:4+0=4\u21926,0+0=0\u21920,0+0=0\u21920. Output [6,0,0]. Correct.\n\nRow3 input [0,0,4,3,3,0]:\n\nGroups:0+3=3\u21926,0+3=3\u21926,4+0=4\u21926. Output [6,6,6]. Correct.\n\nSo the pattern seems to be:\n\nFor each row, split into three groups where each group consists of the element at position i and the element at position i+3 (for i=0,1,2). Sum each pair, and if the sum is greater than 0, output 6; otherwise, output 0.\n\nSo the transformation is:\n\nFor each i in 0,1,2:\n\noutput[i] = 6 if (input[i] + input[i+3]) >0 else 0.\n\nSo the test input is:\n\n[0,4,4,3,0,0]\n[4,0,0,3,3,0]\n[0,4,0,3,0,0]\n\nLet's process each row.\n\nFirst row: [0,4,4,3,0,0]\n\nGroups:\n\ni=0: 0 +3=3 \u21926\n\ni=1:4 +0=4 \u21926\n\ni=2:4 +0=4 \u21926\n\nOutput row: [6,6,6]\n\nSecond row: [4,0,0,3,3,0]\n\nGroups:\n\ni=0:4 +3=7 \u21926\n\ni=1:0 +3=3 \u21926\n\ni=2:0 +0=0 \u21920\n\nOutput row: [6,6,0]\n\nThird row: [0,4,0,3,0,0]\n\nGroups:\n\ni=0:0 +3=3 \u21926\n\ni=1:4 +0=4 \u21926\n\ni=2:0 +0=0 \u21920\n\nOutput row: [6,6,0]\n\nWait, but looking at the outputs of the training examples, sometimes the output rows have different structures. Let me recheck.\n\nWait the test input's rows are:\n\nRow1: [0,4,4,3,0,0]\n\nProcessing:\n\ni=0: 0 +3 (element 0 and 3) \u21923 \u21926\n\ni=1:4 (element1) +0 (element4) \u21924 \u21926\n\ni=2:4 (element2) +0 (element5) \u21924 \u21926\n\nSo output [6,6,6]\n\nRow2: [4,0,0,3,3,0]\n\ni=0:4 +3=7 \u21926\n\ni=1:0 +3=3 \u21926\n\ni=2:0 +0=0 \u21920\n\nOutput [6,6,0]\n\nRow3: [0,4,0,3,0,0]\n\ni=0:0 +3=3 \u21926\n\ni=1:4 +0=4 \u21926\n\ni=2:0 +0=0 \u21920\n\nOutput [6,6,0]\n\nSo combining these, the output should be:\n\n[6,6,6]\n\n[6,6,0]\n\n[6,6,0]\n\nBut let me check the training examples to see if this fits the format.\n\nLooking at Example1's output, the first row is [6,6,6], which matches when all three groups sum to >0.\n\nBut in the test case, row2 and row3 have two 6s and a 0. But looking at the training examples, Example0's row1 output is [6,6,0], which matches this pattern. So the output for the test input should be:\n\n[6,6,6]\n\n[6,6,0]\n\n[6,6,0]\n\nBut let me make sure. For example, in Example2's first row input:\n\n[0,0,4,0,3,0] \u2192 groups (0+0)=0, (0+3)=3, (4+0)=4 \u2192 output [0,6,6]. But according to the rule, 0,3,4 sums are 0 (0),3 (6),4 (6), so output [0,6,6]. Correct.\n\nSo the rule holds.\n\nTherefore, applying this to the test input, the output rows are as calculated."

        "cot_1": "Okay, let's see. I need to figure out the pattern that transforms the input lists into the output lists. Let's look at the training examples to find a common rule.\n\nStarting with Example 0:\nInput rows:\n[4,4,0,3,3,0]\n[4,0,0,3,0,0]\n[0,0,0,0,0,3]\n\nOutput rows:\n[6,6,0]\n[6,0,0]\n[0,0,6]\n\nHmm. The input lists have 6 elements each, and the outputs have 3 elements each. So maybe the input is split into pairs and combined somehow. Let's check the first input row: [4,4,0,3,3,0]. Pairing them as (4,4), (0,3), (3,0). Then the output is [6,6,0]. Oh, adding each pair? 4+4=8, but output is 6. Wait, not exactly. Wait 4+3=7, but 3+0=3. That doesn't fit. Wait maybe the pairs are different. Let's think of other groupings. Alternatively, maybe each output element is formed from two elements in the input, but with some operation other than sum. Let's see.\n\nLooking at the first input row for Example 0's output [6,6,0]. The input row is [4,4,0,3,3,0]. Let's group them into three pairs of two elements each. For the first output element 6: 4 and 4. 4 +4 =8, but output is 6. Maybe taking the sum and then subtracting 2? Or 4 and 4, maybe take the maximum and add 2. But 4 max 4 is 4, plus 2 is 6. Oh, that works. Let's check the next pair. 0 and 3: max is 3, plus 3 gives 6. But 3+3 is 6. Then the third pair 3 and 0: max is 3, plus 3 is 6. But the output here is 0. Hmm, that doesn't fit. Wait maybe that's not the right approach.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the sum of each pair is converted to 6 if certain conditions are met. Let's see. First input pair 4 and 4 sum to 8. Output is 6. Second pair 0+3=3, output 6. Third pair 3+0=3, output 0. That doesn't make sense. Alternatively, maybe each pair's non-zero elements are added, and if both are non-zero, sum them but cap at 6. Or maybe something else.\n\nWait, looking at the output in Example 0, the first element is 6. The input pairs could be 4,4,0,3,3,0. Wait, perhaps each output element corresponds to two adjacent elements in the input, but if they are non-zero, sum them. But how to get 6? Let's take the first two elements 4 and 4: sum is 8. Maybe subtract 2? 8-2=6. Then the next two elements 0 and 3: sum is 3. But output is 6. Hmm. That doesn't fit. Maybe it's something else.\n\nWait maybe the output is grouping the input into two-element pairs and replacing each pair with a 6 if there's a non-zero in the pair, otherwise 0. But in the first input row of example 0: [4,4,0,3,3,0]. The first two elements are both non-zero, so 6. The next two (0,3): one non-zero, so 6. The next two (3,0): one non-zero, so 6. But the output is [6,6,0]. Wait that doesn't match. The third pair would be 6, but output is 0. So that's not right.\n\nWait maybe the output is formed by combining two elements into one, but only if both are non-zero. If both are non-zero, sum to 6. Otherwise, the sum. Let's check. First pair 4 and4: both non-zero. Sum to 8, but output is 6. So maybe if both non-zero, it's 6. Then next pair 0 and3: one is zero. So sum is 3. But output is 6. Hmm, no. Maybe that's not it.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the count of non-zero elements in each pair multiplied by 3. Let's see. First pair (4,4): two non-zero, 2*3=6. Second pair (0,3): one non-zero \u2192 3. Third pair (3,0): one non-zero \u21923. But output is [6,6,0]. So that doesn't fit. Hmm.\n\nWait let's look at another example. Example 1:\n\nInput:\n[4,0,4,3,3,0]\n[4,0,0,3,0,0]\n[0,0,4,3,0,0]\n\nOutput:\n[6,6,6]\n[6,0,0]\n[6,0,6]\n\nFirst input row is [4,0,4,3,3,0]. Grouped into three pairs: (4,0), (4,3), (3,0). Output is [6,6,6]. Let's see. For the first pair (4,0): maybe sum is 4. But output is 6. Hmm. Second pair (4+3)=7, output 6. Third pair 3+0=3, output 6. So this approach doesn't fit. But how?\n\nWait maybe each pair is transformed into 6 if the sum is even, otherwise 0. But 4+0=4 (even) \u21926. 4+3=7 (odd)\u21920. But output is 6. No. Alternatively, if sum is >=6, output 6, else sum. But 4+0=4\u21924, but output is 6. Not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pairs are being treated as digits in a different base. Like 4 and4 in base 10 is 44, but that's not 6. Not helpful.\n\nWait maybe the key is that the output is 6 if the sum of the pair is equal to 7, but that doesn't make sense. Let's think of another angle.\n\nLooking at the output, all elements are 0 or 6. So perhaps each output element is 6 if certain conditions are met in the input pair, else 0.\n\nIn Example 0, the first input row's output is [6,6,0]. The pairs would be (4,4), (0,3), (3,0). So for the first pair, both are 4s. So maybe if both elements are non-zero, then 6. So 4 and4: both non-zero \u21926. Then (0,3): only one is non-zero. So maybe if exactly one is non-zero, then 6? Because in example 0's first row, the output for (0,3) is 6. But the third pair (3,0) gives 0. Wait that contradicts. Because (3,0) is same as (0,3) but output is 0. Hmm. So that can't be.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the pair is summed, and if the sum is greater than or equal to 6, it becomes 6. Let's check:\n\nIn Example 0, first pair 4+4=8 \u21926. Second 0+3=3\u21926? No. So that doesn't fit.\n\nWait perhaps the transformation is different. Let's think about the input numbers. All inputs are 0, 3, or 4. Outputs are 0 or6. So maybe 3 and 4 are involved in some way. 3+3=6, 4+ something? 4+2=6. But where would the 2 come from?\n\nWait maybe each 3 and 4 in the input is being converted to 6, but how? Let's see:\n\nLooking at Example 0's first input row: [4,4,0,3,3,0]. The output is [6,6,0]. If each 4 becomes 6, and 3 becomes 6, but zeros stay zero. Then grouping two elements into one:\n\nWait perhaps each pair is summed, but each 3 and 4 is counted as 3 and 4, but then the sum is converted to 6 if the sum is >=6. Or maybe:\n\nWait perhaps for each pair, if there's a 4 and a 3, sum is 7 \u21926. But in Example 0's first row, the pairs are (4,4) sum 8 \u21926, (0,3) sum3 \u21926? No. Doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each pair is replaced by the number of non-zero elements multiplied by 3. So in Example 0's first pair (4,4) \u21922*3=6. Second pair (0,3) \u21921*3=3, but output is 6. Doesn't fit.\n\nWait maybe the output is 6 if either element in the pair is non-zero. Then for Example 0's first row: all three pairs have at least one non-zero, so output would be [6,6,6]. But the actual output is [6,6,0]. So third pair (3,0) \u2192 output 0. So that's not it.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is 6 if the pair sums to an even number. For Example 0's first row: (4,4) sum 8 even \u21926. (0,3) sum3 odd\u21920. (3,0) sum3 odd\u21920. But output is [6,6,0]. So first pair is even (6), second pair is odd (0), third pair is odd (0). But output for second pair is 6. So that's not right.\n\nHmm. Let's look at another example. Example 2:\n\nInput:\n[0,0,4,0,3,0]\n[0,4,4,3,0,3]\n[4,4,0,0,0,3]\n\nOutput:\n[0,6,6]\n[6,6,6]\n[6,6,6]\n\nInput rows have elements 0,4,3. Outputs are 0 and6. Let's look at the first input row: [0,0,4,0,3,0]. Grouped as (0,0), (4,0), (3,0). The output is [0,6,6]. So for (0,0) \u21920. Then (4,0) \u21926. (3,0) \u21926. So maybe if the pair has at least one non-zero, output 6. But (0,0) gives 0. But other pairs with at least one non-zero give 6. So in that case, the output is 6 if the pair has any non-zero elements. But in Example 0's third pair (3,0) in the first row, the output is 0. Wait, that contradicts. Wait Example 0's first input row is [4,4,0,3,3,0], grouped as (4,4), (0,3), (3,0). Output is [6,6,0]. The third pair (3,0) gives 0. But according to the logic of \"any non-zero gives 6\", that would be 6. But here it's 0. So that can't be.\n\nHmm. Maybe there's a different pattern. Let's think about how the input is structured. Each input row has 6 elements, and the output row has 3 elements. So each output element corresponds to two input elements. Let's see:\n\nFor each output position i (0,1,2), it's derived from input positions 2i and 2i+1.\n\nBut how? Let's see:\n\nIn Example 0:\n\nInput row 0: positions 0-5: 4,4,0,3,3,0. Output row 0: [6,6,0].\n\nSo:\n\noutput[0] from 4 and4 \u21926\n\noutput[1] from 0 and3 \u21926\n\noutput[2] from3 and0 \u21920\n\nWait, but that doesn't follow a clear rule. Let's check other examples.\n\nExample 1:\n\nInput row 0: [4,0,4,3,3,0]. Output row0: [6,6,6].\n\nGrouped as (4,0), (4,3), (3,0). Outputs 6,6,6.\n\nSo first pair 4,0 \u21926. Second pair4,3\u21926. Third pair3,0\u21926.\n\nBut in Example0, the third pair was 3,0 \u21920. So why is it different here? Hmm. There's inconsistency here. So maybe there's another factor.\n\nWait perhaps the direction matters. Like, when pairing, if the left element is non-zero, sum with the next non-zero element to the right? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is 6 if both elements in the pair are non-zero. Let's check:\n\nExample0 first pair (4,4): both non-zero \u21926. Output correct.\n\nSecond pair (0,3): only 3 is non-zero. So output would be 0, but in the output it's 6. So no.\n\nAlternatively, if either element is non-zero, output 6. But then third pair in Example0 is (3,0) \u21926, but output is 0. So that's not it.\n\nWait maybe the sum of the pair is 6 or more. Let's see:\n\n4+4=8 \u21926.\n\n0+3=3\u2192 no. But output is 6. So that's not.\n\nWait maybe 4 and 3 in any pair sum to 7, which is converted to 6. But 4+4=8, which is converted to 6. 0+3=3, but output is6. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, the sum is divided by something. But 8/ (something) gives 6. No.\n\nWait maybe the rule is that each 4 and 3 in the input is transformed into 6, and then the pairs are combined. For example, in a pair, if there's a 4, it becomes 6, and 3 becomes 6. Then the sum is capped at 6. But in the first pair of Example0: 4 and4 \u21926+6=12 \u21926. Second pair 0 and3 \u21920 +6=6. Third pair3 and0\u21926+0=6. But the output for third pair is 0. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each 4 and 3 in the input is replaced by 3 and 4 respectively, and then summed. Not sure.\n\nWait let's look at another approach. All outputs are made of 6s and 0s. Maybe the input pairs are being checked for certain conditions. For example, if the pair contains both 4 and 3, then output 6. Or if the sum is 7. But how?\n\nLooking at Example0's first input row:\n\nPair (4,4): sum 8. Output 6.\n\nPair (0,3): sum3. Output6.\n\nPair (3,0): sum3. Output0.\n\nHmm. Doesn't make sense.\n\nWait maybe the position in the row matters. Like, for each output position, it's 6 if the sum of all elements in certain columns is even or something. But not sure.\n\nAnother angle: maybe each input row is split into two parts, each part summed, and then transformed. Let's see:\n\nExample0 input row0: [4,4,0,3,3,0]. Split into two parts of 3 elements each: [4,4,0] and [3,3,0]. Sum each part: 8 and6. Then output might be 6 and6, but the output is [6,6,0]. Not matching.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each triplet of the input is processed. But output has 3 elements for 6 elements in input, so that's two elements per output. Maybe grouping as triples and then processing.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is derived from the input by combining every two elements into 6 if they are non-zero and adjacent in some way. Not sure.\n\nWait let's consider the possibility that the output is formed by merging two elements into one, where each element in the output is 6 if there's a 4 and a 3 in the corresponding positions across the rows. For example, looking at all three input rows for a particular position and combining. But this is getting complicated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each output element is 6 if the sum of the corresponding elements in the input rows equals 6. Let's see:\n\nIn Example0, the input rows are:\n\nRow0:4,4,0,3,3,0\n\nRow1:4,0,0,3,0,0\n\nRow2:0,0,0,0,0,3\n\nOutput rows are:\n\n[6,6,0]\n\n[6,0,0]\n\n[0,0,6]\n\nWait maybe for each output cell, it's 6 if the sum of the three input rows' elements in the corresponding position is 6. But let's check.\n\nFor example, in Output0, first element 6. The corresponding input elements across rows:\n\nRow0[0] =4, Row1[0]=4, Row2[0]=0. Sum is 8. Not 6.\n\nHmm. So that's not it.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each output cell is the sum of the corresponding two elements in the input row. For example, in Example0's first input row [4,4,0,3,3,0], the output is [6,6,0]. So 4+4=8 \u21926, 0+3=3\u21926, 3+0=3\u21920. No, that doesn't fit.\n\nWait perhaps each output element is 6 if both elements in the pair are non-zero, else 0. Let's check Example0:\n\nFirst pair (4,4): both non-zero \u21926. Correct.\n\nSecond pair (0,3): one non-zero \u21920. But output is6. So no.\n\nHmm. This is tricky. Let's try to find another pattern.\n\nLooking at Example1's input and output:\n\nInput row0: [4,0,4,3,3,0]. Output row0: [6,6,6].\n\nGrouped as (4,0), (4,3), (3,0). Output all 6s. So why are all these pairs giving 6? Even though some pairs have zeros.\n\nWait maybe if the sum of the pair is even, then 6. If odd, then 0.\n\nExample0's first pair sum 8 (even) \u21926. Second pair 3 (odd) \u21920, but output is6. So that doesn't fit.\n\nWait maybe the output is 6 if either of the elements is non-zero. So for all pairs except (0,0), output 6. But in Example0's third pair (3,0) \u21926, but output is0. So that's not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is 6 if the pair contains a 4 and a 3. Let's see:\n\nExample0's first pair (4,4): no 3. So output is6. So that's not. But output is6. So that's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is 6 if the pair's sum is divisible by 3. For example, 4+4=8 \u2192 not. 0+3=3 \u2192 yes. 3+0=3\u2192 yes. But output is [6,6,0]. So the third pair is sum3 \u21926, but output is0. So no.\n\nWait maybe the rule is that for each pair, if there's a 4 present, output 6. If not, check for 3. So if a pair has a 4, output6. Else, if it has a 3, output6. Else 0. Let's test:\n\nExample0's first pair (4,4): has 4 \u21926. Second pair (0,3): has3 \u21926. Third pair (3,0): has3\u21926. But output is0. Doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. Maybe it's something else. Let's look for a pattern that can fit all examples.\n\nAnother approach: the outputs are 6 when the sum of the pair is >=6, but how? Let's check:\n\nIn Example0's first pair sum8\u21926. Second pair3\u2192 no. But output is6. So that's not.\n\nWait maybe each 4 and 3 in the input is counted as a 3 and 3, respectively, so that 4 becomes 3, 3 becomes3. Then sum pairs.\n\nExample0's first pair (3+3=6) \u21926. Second pair (0+3=3) \u21923. But output is6. So maybe if the sum is >=3, output6. So 3 and above become6, else 0.\n\nBut for Example0's third pair (3+0=3) \u21926. Output is0. Doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each 4 and3 in the input is replaced by 3, then sum pairs. For example:\n\nExample0's first input row: 4,4,0,3,3,0 \u21923,3,0,3,3,0. Pair sums: 3+3=6, 0+3=3, 3+0=3. Output would be [6,3,3], but actual output is [6,6,0]. So that's not.\n\nAnother idea: each pair is transformed into 6 if the pair contains at least one 4 and one 3. But in Example0's first pair (4,4) \u2192 no 3, but output is6. So that's not.\n\nWait, perhaps the output is formed by combining the two elements into a single digit, and then converting to 6 if it's even, else 0. For example, (4,4) \u219244 is even \u21926. (0,3)\u219203=3\u2192 odd \u21920. But in Example0's output, the second element is6. So that's not.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the digits are multiplied. 4*4=16. But how to get 6. Not clear.\n\nAlternatively, the output is 6 for every non-zero pair. But in Example0's first row, third pair is3 and0 \u2192 non-zero \u21926. Output is0. So no.\n\nLet's think about the positions across the rows. For example, the output might be determined by combining elements vertically across the input rows. For example, the first element of each output row is derived from the first two elements of each input row. But let's check:\n\nExample0's output is:\n\n[6,6,0]\n\n[6,0,0]\n\n[0,0,6]\n\nInput rows:\n\nRow0:4,4,0,3,3,0\n\nRow1:4,0,0,3,0,0\n\nRow2:0,0,0,0,0,3\n\nLooking at the first output element of each output row: 6,6,0. These correspond to input elements in positions (0,1) of each row. Row0's first two elements are4,4. Row1's are4,0. Row2's are0,0. How do these relate to the outputs 6,6,0.\n\nMaybe sum each row's first two elements. Row0:8\u21926. Row1:4+0=4\u21926. Hmm. Not clear.\n\nAlternatively, for each row, the first two elements are summed. If the sum is >=6, output6. Row0:8\u21926. Row1:4+0=4\u2192 not. But output is6. So no.\n\nHmm. I'm stuck. Let's try a different approach. Look for patterns in the outputs.\n\nAll outputs are combinations of 6 and 0. So the transformation must be converting pairs into 6 or 0 based on some condition.\n\nLooking at Example0's third pair (3,0) \u21920. Example1's third pair (3,0)\u21926. So the same pair can give different outputs. So the condition must depend on something else, possibly other elements in the row or across rows.\n\nWait maybe the pattern involves the entire row. For example, each output element is 6 if the sum of the row's pairs meets a certain condition.\n\nWait Example0's first input row sum is 4+4+0+3+3+0=14. Output row sum is6+6+0=12. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking the first three elements of the input row and the last three, combining them in some way. For example:\n\nInput row0: [4,4,0,3,3,0]. Split into [4,4,0] and [3,3,0]. Then output elements could be the sum of each part's non-zero elements, capped at6. First part sum:4+4=8 \u21926. Second part sum3+3=6. Third part? Not sure. The output is [6,6,0]. So maybe the first two parts sum to 6 and 6, but the third is 0. Not clear.\n\nAlternatively, the output is the sum of each pair of elements, but each element is converted to 3 if it's 4 or 3. So 4 becomes3, 3 becomes3, 0 remains0. Then sum pairs:\n\nExample0's first pair (4\u21923,4\u21923) \u21926. Second pair (0\u21920,3\u21923) \u21923. Third pair (3\u21923,0\u21920) \u21923. Output is [6,6,0]. So that doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. Let's look at another example. Example3's input:\n\n[4,4,0,3,0,0]\n\n[0,0,0,0,0,3]\n\n[4,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nOutput:\n\n[6,6,0]\n\n[0,0,6]\n\n[6,0,0]\n\nInput row0's pairs are (4,4), (0,3), (0,0). Output is [6,6,0]. So first pair: 6, second 6, third 0. So first pair is both 4s \u21926. Second pair 0 and3 \u21926. Third pair 0 and0 \u21920.\n\nAh! Maybe the rule is: if both elements in the pair are non-zero, then 6. If only one is non-zero, 6. If both are zero, 0. Wait, but in Example0's third pair (3,0), the output is0. But according to this rule, it should be6. So that's conflicting.\n\nBut in Example3's input row0, second pair (0,3) \u2192 output6. So the rule would say that any pair with at least one non-zero is 6. But in Example0's third pair (3,0), output is0. That's a contradiction.\n\nSo perhaps there's another factor. Let's look at the third pair in Example0's first input row: (3,0). The output is0. But in Example3's second pair (0,3) \u21926. So it's the same pair elements but reversed. But outputs differ. So direction might matter. Or maybe the position in the row matters.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is 6 only if the pair contains a 4 or a 3, but not both. Or some other condition.\n\nWait in Example0's first input row, third pair is (3,0). The output is0. But 3 is present. So why is it 0?\n\nWait maybe the rule is that a pair is 6 if it contains a 4, regardless of the other element. Otherwise, if it contains a 3 and the other element is non-zero, then 6. Otherwise,0.\n\nLet's test:\n\nExample0 first pair (4,4): contains 4 \u21926. Correct.\n\nSecond pair (0,3): no4, but has3. Other element is0 (zero). So output0. But example0's output is6. So no.\n\nHmm. Not working.\n\nAnother idea: maybe the output is 6 if the sum of the pair is divisible by 3. For example:\n\nExample0 first pair 4+4=8 \u21928%3=2 \u21920. But output is6. No.\n\nAlternatively, sum modulo 6. 8 mod6=2 \u21920. No.\n\nAlternatively, if the pair has at least one 4, output6. Otherwise, if at least one 3, output6. Otherwise,0.\n\nExample0's first pair: yes (4,4) \u21926.\n\nSecond pair (0,3): has3 \u21926.\n\nThird pair (3,0): has3\u21926. But output is0. So no.\n\nBut example0's output for third pair is0. So this is conflicting.\n\nWait maybe it's the other way around: the pair must contain a 4 and a 3 to output6. Otherwise,0.\n\nBut Example0's first pair (4,4): no 3. Output is6. So that's not.\n\nHmm. I'm really stuck. Let's try to look for another pattern.\n\nLet's consider the possibility that the output is derived from merging two elements in the input, but only if they are the same. For example, in Example0's first pair (4,4), which are the same, output6. Second pair (0,3) different \u21920. But output is6. So that's not.\n\nAlternatively, merging pairs into 6 if they are both non-zero, and their sum is 6 or more. For example, 4+4=8 \u21926. 3+3=6 \u21926. 4+3=7\u21926. 0+3=3 \u21920. But in Example0's second pair (0,3) sum3 \u21920, but output is6. So no.\n\nWait another approach: the outputs are the count of 4's and 3's in each pair, multiplied by 3. For example, (4,4) \u21922*3=6. (0,3) \u21921*3=3 \u2192 but output is6. No.\n\nAlternatively, the count of non-zero elements multiplied by 3. (4,4) \u21922*3=6. (0,3) \u21921*3=3. But output is6. So that's not.\n\nWait maybe the output is 6 if the pair contains exactly two non-zero elements, regardless of their values. Let's check:\n\nExample0's first pair (4,4) \u2192 two non-zero \u21926. Output correct.\n\nSecond pair (0,3) \u2192 one \u21920. But output is6.\n\nNo. Doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, if the pair contains any non-zero, output6. But in Example0's third pair (3,0) \u21926. But output is0. So no.\n\nWait maybe the output is 6 if the pair has both elements non-zero and they are the same. (4,4) \u21926. (3,3) \u21926. Others \u21920. Let's check Example0's first row: pairs (4,4)\u21926, (0,3)\u21920, (3,0)\u21920. Output is [6,6,0]. So that doesn't fit. The second output element is6 but the pair (0,3) would give0.\n\nHmm. This is really challenging. Let's try to look for a different angle.\n\nLooking at the test input:\n\nTest Input:\n\n[0, 0, 4, 0, 3, 0]\n\n[0, 4, 0, 3, 3, 3]\n\n[4, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0]\n\nExpected to output something based on the pattern.\n\nPerhaps each output element is 6 if the sum of the three elements in the corresponding position across all rows is 6. Let's check:\n\nFor example, first output element of each row would be:\n\nTest input rows:\n\nRow0:0,0,4,0,3,0\n\nRow1:0,4,0,3,3,3\n\nRow2:4,0,0,3,0,0\n\nBut the output has three elements per row. So each output element corresponds to two elements in the input row.\n\nWait, perhaps for each output row and position, the output is 6 if the sum of the two input elements in that pair is >=6. Otherwise, 0. Let's check the training examples.\n\nExample0's first input pair (4+4)=8 >=6 \u21926. Second pair (0+3)=3 <6 \u21920. But output is6. So no.\n\nAlternatively, if the sum is >=7. 4+4=8 \u21926. 0+3=3 \u21920. 3+0=3 \u21920. But example0's output is [6,6,0]. So that doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. Let's think of all training examples and see if there's a common rule.\n\nExample0:\n\nInput rows:\n\nRow0:4,4,0,3,3,0 \u2192 output [6,6,0]\n\nRow1:4,0,0,3,0,0 \u2192 output [6,0,0]\n\nRow2:0,0,0,0,0,3 \u2192 output [0,0,6]\n\nExample1:\n\nRow0:4,0,4,3,3,0 \u2192 [6,6,6]\n\nRow1:4,0,0,3,0,0 \u2192 [6,0,0]\n\nRow2:0,0,4,3,0,0 \u2192 [6,0,6]\n\nExample2:\n\nRow0:0,0,4,0,3,0 \u2192 [0,6,6]\n\nRow1:0,4,4,3,0,3 \u2192 [6,6,6]\n\nRow2:4,4,0,0,0,3 \u2192 [6,6,6]\n\nExample3:\n\nRow0:4,4,0,3,0,0 \u2192 [6,6,0]\n\nRow1:0,0,0,0,0,3 \u2192 [0,0,6]\n\nRow2:4,0,0,0,0,0 \u2192 [6,0,0]\n\nExample4:\n\nRow0:0,0,0,0,3,0 \u2192 [0,6,0]\n\nRow1:4,0,0,0,0,0 \u2192 [6,0,0]\n\nRow2:0,0,4,3,3,0 \u2192 [6,6,6]\n\nLooking for a pattern in these. The output seems to have 6 where there are pairs of 4s or 3s in the input. But how?\n\nWait in Example0's row0: the first pair (4,4) \u21926, second pair (0,3) \u21926, third pair (3,0) \u21920. \n\nIn Example1's row0: (4,0) \u21926, (4,3) \u21926, (3,0) \u21926. \n\nHmm. The only time a pair (3,0) is 0 is in Example0's row0. Other times like Example1's row0, it's 6. So there must be another factor.\n\nAnother observation: in Example0's row0, the third pair is (3,0), and the output is0. But in Example1's row0, third pair (3,0) \u21926. What's the difference between these two cases?\n\nLooking at the entire rows:\n\nExample0 row0: [4,4,0,3,3,0]. So after the third pair, the row has 3 and 0.\n\nExample1 row0: [4,0,4,3,3,0]. The third pair is (3,0).\n\nWait, perhaps the output depends on the presence of certain numbers in the entire row. For example, if the row has an even number of 4s and 3s, then certain pairs are 6. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is derived by looking at the positions vertically across all three rows.\n\nFor example, each output element in position i of row j is 6 if the sum of the corresponding pair in all three input rows meets a condition.\n\nBut this is getting too complicated. Let's try to think of a different approach.\n\nLooking at the output rows, they all have 0s and 6s. Let's think about the input rows and see if there's a way to map each pair to 6 or 0 based on some rule.\n\nLet me take a wild guess: each pair in the input is transformed into 6 if there's a 4 or 3 in the pair, but if the pair contains a 4 and a 3, then it's 6. Otherwise, 0. But this doesn't fit Example0's second pair (0,3) which would be 6. Third pair (3,0) \u21926. But output is0. So that's not.\n\nAnother idea: each pair is replaced by 6 if the sum of the pair is a multiple of 3. 4+4=8 \u2192 not. 0+3=3 \u2192 yes. 3+0=3 \u2192 yes. Example0's output is [6,6,0]. But according to this, it would be [6,3,3], which doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. I'm really stuck. Let's try to find a pattern in the outputs.\n\nLooking at Example0's output:\n\n[6,6,0]\n\n[6,0,0]\n\n[0,0,6]\n\nThe 6s are positioned where the input pairs have 4s and 3s. For example, in row0's first pair (4,4), output6. Second pair (0,3) \u21926. Third pair (3,0) \u21920. Why?\n\nWait maybe the rule is that the output is 6 if the pair contains two 4s or two 3s, otherwise 0. Let's check:\n\nExample0's first pair (4,4) \u21926. Second pair (0,3) \u21920. But output is6. So no.\n\nAlternatively, if the pair contains any two identical numbers (4 and4, 3 and3, 0 and0) \u21926 if they are same and non-zero, else 0. So:\n\n(4,4) \u21926. (0,0) \u21926 if both are 0. But in Example0's third pair (3,0) \u2192 different \u21920. Second pair (0,3) \u2192 different \u21920. But output for second pair is6. So that's not.\n\nAnother idea: the output is 6 if the pair consists of a 4 and a 3. But (4,4) \u2192 no. Output is6. So that's not.\n\nWait what if the output is 6 if the pair sums to 7 (4+3) or 8 (4+4). Let's see:\n\nExample0's first pair sum8\u21926. Second pair sum3\u2192 no. Output is6. Doesn't fit.\n\nHmm.\n\nPerhaps I should look for a pattern that combines the rows in a different way. Like, for each output row, the corresponding input row is transformed by adding the non-zero elements and mapping to 6 if sum is non-zero. But that's too vague.\n\nAnother observation: in all outputs, the 6s are clustered. Maybe it's a matter of the number of non-zero pairs in the row. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the output could be based on the number of 4s and 3s in the entire input. For example, each 4 and 3 contributes to a 6 in the output. But how.\n\nWait in Example0's input row0: 4,4,0,3,3,0. Count of 4s and 3s: 2+2=4. Output row0 has three elements: 6,6,0 \u2192 sum 12. Which is 4\u00d73=12. Maybe each 4 and 3 in the input contributes a 3 to the output sum. 4\u00d73=12. But how this translates to individual elements. Not clear.\n\nAlternatively, each 4 and 3 in the input is converted to a 3 in the output, but grouped into pairs. So two 4s become 3+3=6. 4 and 0 become 3. But in Example0's row0's first pair (4,4) \u21926. Second pair (0,3) \u21923. Third pair (3,0) \u21923. Output is [6,6,0]. So 6, 3,3. But output is6,6,0. So this doesn't fit.\n\nI'm really stuck. Let me try to think of the simplest possible solution.\n\nLooking at all the examples, the output elements are 0 or6. So perhaps each pair in the input is transformed into 6 if there's a 4 or 3 in the pair, regardless of position. If both are zero, then 0. So any pair with at least one 4 or3 becomes6. Let's check:\n\nExample0's row0:\n\nPairs (4,4) \u21926, (0,3) \u21926, (3,0) \u21926. Output is [6,6,0]. But according to this, third pair should be6. So that's not.\n\nBut Example0's output third element is0. So why?\n\nAh, unless the pair contains a 4 or3 but not both. But that doesn't make sense. Or maybe the pair must contain a4 and a3. But no, (4,4) has no 3.\n\nThis is not working. Let's try to see another way.\n\nLooking at Example0's output row0: [6,6,0]. The corresponding input pairs are (4,4), (0,3), (3,0). The output has 6,6,0.\n\nExample1's output row0: [6,6,6]. Pairs (4,0), (4,3), (3,0). Output is6 for all.\n\nExample2's output row0: [0,6,6]. Pairs (0,0), (4,0), (3,0). Output 0,6,6.\n\nExample3's output row0: [6,6,0]. Pairs (4,4), (0,3), (0,0). Output6,6,0.\n\nExample4's output row0: [0,6,0]. Pairs (0,0), (0,0), (3,0). Output0,6,0.\n\nSo for pairs with two zeros \u21920. Pairs with at least one 4 or 3 \u21926. But in Example0's third pair (3,0) \u21926, but output is0. So that's conflicting.\n\nWait maybe the output is 6 for each pair that has a non-zero element, except when the non-zero element is 3 and it's in the second position of the pair. For example, (0,3) \u21926, (3,0) \u21920. Let's test:\n\nExample0's pairs (4,4)\u21926, (0,3)\u21926, (3,0)\u21920. Output matches.\n\nExample1's pairs (4,0)\u21926 (non-zero in first position), (4,3)\u21926, (3,0)\u21920. But output is [6,6,6]. So third pair output is6, but according to this rule it should be0. So no.\n\nHmm. Not matching.\n\nAlternatively, if the pair has a non-zero element in the first position \u21926. If only in the second \u21920. Let's check:\n\nExample0's pairs:\n\n(4,4)\u21926, (0,3)\u21920 (non-zero in second), (3,0)\u21926 (non-zero in first). Output [6,6,0]. Doesn't fit.\n\nBut example0's output for third pair is0. So this doesn't work.\n\nAnother idea: the output is 6 if the first element of the pair is non-zero. Otherwise, 0. So:\n\nExample0's first pair (4,4)\u21926. Second pair (0,3)\u21920. Third pair (3,0)\u21926. Output would be [6,0,6]. But actual output is [6,6,0]. No.\n\nAlternatively, the output is 6 if the second element is non-zero. So:\n\nExample0's pairs: (4,4) \u2192 yes \u21926. (0,3) \u2192 yes \u21926. (3,0) \u2192 no \u21920. Output matches [6,6,0]. This works for Example0.\n\nCheck Example1's row0: pairs (4,0) \u2192 second element is 0 \u21920. But output is6. So this doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. But Example1's first pair is (4,0) \u2192 second element 0. Output is6. So that rule doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, output is 6 if either element is non-zero. But in Example0's third pair (3,0) \u21926. Output is0. So that's not.\n\nI'm really stuck here. Let's try to think of another approach.\n\nLooking at the test input:\n\nTest Input:\n\nRow0: [0, 0, 4, 0, 3, 0]\n\nRow1: [0, 4, 0, 3, 3, 3]\n\nRow2: [4, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0]\n\nAccording to the previous examples, perhaps each output element is 6 if the pair has a non-zero in the second position. Let's see:\n\nRow0's pairs:\n\n(0,0) \u21920, (4,0) \u21920, (3,0) \u21920. Output would be [0,0,0]. But this is unlikely given the training examples.\n\nAlternatively, if the pair has a non-zero in either position. But Example0's third pair is (3,0) \u21926. But output is0. So no.\n\nAnother possibility: the output is 6 if the sum of the pair is 4 or 3. For example, 4+0=4 \u21926. 3+0=3 \u21926. 4+4=8\u21926. 0+3=3\u21926. 3+3=6\u21926. 0+0=0\u21920.\n\nBut in Example0's third pair (3,0) sum3 \u21926. But output is0. So this contradicts.\n\nHmm. I'm really not seeing the pattern. Let's try to look for any other possible correlation.\n\nWait, looking at the output of Example0:\n\nInput rows:\n\nRow0:4,4,0,3,3,0 \u2192 output [6,6,0]\n\nRow1:4,0,0,3,0,0 \u2192 [6,0,0]\n\nRow2:0,0,0,0,0,3 \u2192 [0,0,6]\n\nNotice that in each output row, the 6s seem to correspond to the positions where there are 4s and 3s in the input row, but grouped in pairs. For example, row0's output has 6s in the first two positions, which correspond to pairs (4,4) and (0,3). But why is the third pair (3,0) output0?\n\nAnother observation: in the output, the number of 6s seems to correspond to the number of 4s and 3s in the input row divided by 2. For example, row0 has 4s and 3s: 4,4,3,3 \u21924 elements. 4/2=2 \u2192 two 6s. But the output has three 6s. So that's not.\n\nAlternatively, the output counts the number of 4s and 3s in pairs. For example, row0 has two 4s and two 3s. Divided into three pairs: two pairs contribute to 6s. But output has two 6s and one 0. So that fits. Wait Example0's row0 output is [6,6,0], two 6s. Input row0 has four non-zero elements (two 4s, two 3s). Divided by two (each pair), gives two 6s. So the third pair (3,0) has one non-zero \u2192 not counted. So output is two 6s and one 0. This fits.\n\nExample1's row0 input: [4,0,4,3,3,0]. Non-zero elements:4,4,3,3 \u2192 four. Output has three 6s. So this doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. So that's not consistent.\n\nAnother thought: perhaps each pair in the input contributes a 6 to the output if the pair contains exactly two non-zero elements. Otherwise, 0. Let's check:\n\nExample0 row0:\n\n(4,4) \u2192 yes \u21926.\n\n(0,3) \u2192 no \u21920.\n\n(3,0) \u2192 no \u21920.\n\nOutput would be [6,0,0]. But actual output is [6,6,0]. So no.\n\nAlternatively, if the pair contains at least one non-zero, output6. But Example0's third pair (3,0) \u21926. Output is0. So no.\n\nI'm really stuck. Let's try to think outside the box. What if the output is the result of some logical operation between the elements of the pair. For example, XOR. But 4 XOR4 is 0, which doesn't make sense. 0 XOR3 is3, again not 6.\n\nAlternatively, the output is 6 if the pair contains both 4 and 3. But in Example0's first pair (4,4) \u2192 no. Output is6. So no.\n\nHmm. Maybe the answer is to look for the number of 4s and 3s in each pair, and if there's at least one, output6. But in Example0's third pair (3,0) \u2192 yes. Output is0.\n\nI'm really not getting it. Let's try to think of the test input and what the output might be based on the examples.\n\nTest Input:\n\nRow0:0,0,4,0,3,0 \u2192 pairs (0,0), (4,0), (3,0). \n\nRow1:0,4,0,3,3,3 \u2192 pairs (0,4), (0,3), (3,3).\n\nRow2:4,0,0,3,0,0 \u2192 pairs (4,0), (0,3), (0,0).\n\nLooking at similar examples:\n\nExample4's input row0: [0,0,0,0,3,0]. Pairs (0,0), (0,0), (3,0). Output is [0,6,0]. So the second pair (0,0) becomes6? No. Wait example4's output row0 is [0,6,0]. So the pairs (0,0) \u21920, (0,0) \u21926, (3,0) \u21920. That doesn't make sense. So maybe the rule is more complex.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is generated by adding each pair and if the sum is >=4, output6. Otherwise, 0. Let's test:\n\nTest input row0 pairs:\n\n0+0=0 \u21920.\n\n4+0=4 \u21926.\n\n3+0=3 \u21920.\n\nOutput would be [0,6,0].\n\nRow1 pairs:\n\n0+4=4 \u21926.\n\n0+3=3 \u21920.\n\n3+3=6 \u21926.\n\nOutput [6,0,6].\n\nRow2 pairs:\n\n4+0=4 \u21926.\n\n0+3=3 \u21920.\n\n0+0=0 \u21920.\n\nOutput [6,0,0].\n\nBut looking at the training examples:\n\nExample0 row0: pairs 4+4=8 \u21926, 0+3=3 \u21920, 3+0=3 \u21920. Output [6,6,0]. So this doesn't fit. So this rule is incorrect.\n\nHmm. Another idea: each output element is 6 if the pair contains a 4, regardless of the other element. If the pair contains a 3 but no4, then 6. Otherwise,0.\n\nTest input row0:\n\n(0,0) \u21920.\n\n(4,0) \u21926.\n\n(3,0) \u21926 (contains3). So output [0,6,6].\n\nRow1:\n\n(0,4) \u21926 (contains4).\n\n(0,3) \u21926 (contains3).\n\n(3,3) \u21926 (contains3). So output [6,6,6].\n\nRow2:\n\n(4,0) \u21926.\n\n(0,3) \u21926.\n\n(0,0) \u21920. So output [6,6,0].\n\nBut looking at Example0's row0 output is [6,6,0]. According to this rule, the third pair (3,0) has a3 \u21926. But output is0. So this rule is invalid.\n\nHmm. I'm not making progress. Let's look for another approach.\n\nPerhaps the output is 6 if the pair contains a 4 followed by a 3, or vice versa. Or a pair of 4s or 3s. Let's see.\n\nExample0 row0: (4,4) \u21926, (0,3) \u21926 (3 is present), (3,0) \u21920. So perhaps 6 if the pair has a4 or3 in either position, but if the pair is (3,0) \u21920. But why?\n\nAlternatively, the output is 6 if the pair has a 4 in the first position or a3 in the second position. For Example0's pairs:\n\n(4,4): 4 in first \u21926.\n\n(0,3):3 in second \u21926.\n\n(3,0):3 in first \u21926. But output is0. So no.\n\nThis isn't working.\n\nAt this point, I think I need to make an educated guess based on the test input and the closest examples. Looking at the test input:\n\nRow0: [0,0,4,0,3,0]. Possible pairs (0,0), (4,0), (3,0). \n\nLooking at Example2's row0 input: [0,0,4,0,3,0], output [0,6,6]. The pairs for Example2 row0 are (0,0), (4,0), (3,0). Output is [0,6,6]. So perhaps in this case, the output is 0 for (0,0), 6 for (4,0), and 6 for (3,0). But according to Example0's row0 third pair (3,0) gives0. So why is it different here?\n\nThe only difference between Example2's row0 and Test input row0 is the order of elements, but not sure. \n\nBut in Example2's row0 output is [0,6,6]. So (4,0) \u21926, (3,0) \u21926. So maybe the rule is that if the pair contains a4 or3, regardless of position, output6. But then why in Example0's row0 third pair (3,0) output is0.\n\nAlternatively, the output is 6 if the pair has a non-zero element in the second position. Example0's row0 third pair (3,0) \u21920 in second \u21920. Example2's row0 third pair (3,0) \u21920 in second \u21920. But Example2's output for third pair is6. So this is conflicting.\n\nThis is very confusing. Perhaps the pattern is to look at the entire row and for each pair, if there's a 4 in any of the three rows' corresponding pair, output6. Or something like that.\n\nAlternatively, the output is 6 if any of the three input rows' pair has a non-zero element in that position. For example, for each output position, if any of the input rows' pair has a non-zero element there, output6.\n\nBut how this applies.\n\nFor example, in the test input:\n\nRow0: (0,0) \u21920s. Row1: (0,4) \u21924. Row2: (4,0) \u21924. So for the first pair across all rows, there are non-zero elements. So output6. Second pair: Row0's (4,0), Row1's (0,3), Row2's (0,3). All have non-zero. So output6. Third pair: Row0's (3,0), Row1's (3,3), Row2's (0,0). So non-zero in row0 and1. So output6. So output would be [6,6,6] for all rows. But this doesn't match the examples.\n\nAlternatively, for each output row, the output is 6 where the corresponding pair in the input row has non-zero elements, and also considering other rows. Not sure.\n\nGiven that I can't find a clear pattern, I'll try to make a guess based on the test input and the closest example.\n\nLooking at the test input:\n\nRow0:0,0,4,0,3,0 \u2192 pairs (0,0), (4,0), (3,0). Possible output based on Example2's row0, which has similar elements: [0,6,6].\n\nRow1:0,4,0,3,3,3 \u2192 pairs (0,4), (0,3), (3,3). Example1's row0 has (4,0), (4,3), (3,0) \u2192 output [6,6,6]. So maybe here, output [6,6,6].\n\nRow2:4,0,0,3,0,0 \u2192 pairs (4,0), (0,3), (0,0). Example3's row0 has (4,4,0,3,0,0) \u2192 output [6,6,0]. So here, maybe (4,0) \u21926, (0,3) \u21926, (0,0) \u21920. So output [6,6,0].\n\nSo combining these:\n\nRow0: [0,6,6]\n\nRow1: [6,6,6]\n\nRow2: [6,6,0]\n\nBut I need to check if this matches any examples. Example2's output has [0,6,6], [6,6,6], [6,6,6]. So perhaps similar.\n\nThus, the final output might be:\n\n[0,6,6]\n\n[6,6,6]\n\n[6,6,0]\n\nBut I'm not sure. This is a guess based on similar examples.",

        "cot_2": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. So, there are these input arrays and output arrays. The inputs are lists of numbers, and the outputs are transformed versions. Let's look at the training examples to see what's going on.\n\nStarting with Example 0:\n\nInput:\n[4,4,0,3,3,0]\n[4,0,0,3,0,0]\n[0,0,0,0,0,3]\n\nOutput:\n[6,6,0]\n[6,0,0]\n[0,0,6]\n\nHmm. The output arrays are shorter than the input. Each input row has 6 elements, output has 3. So maybe each pair of elements in the input is combined into one in the output. Let's check.\n\nFirst input row: [4,4,0,3,3,0]. If we group them into pairs: [4,4], [0,3], [3,0]. Sum each pair? 8, 3, 3. But the output is [6,6,0]. Wait, 4+4 is 8, but output is 6. Not sum. Maybe multiply each pair? 4*4=16, but that's not 6. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe count the non-zero numbers in each pair. For [4,4], both are non-zero. So 2 non-zero, but output is 6. Maybe multiply the count by 3? 2*3=6. Let's check the next pair in the same example: [0,3]. One non-zero, so 1*3=3. But output is 6. Wait, no. The output here is the second element as 6, third as 0. Wait, first output row is [6,6,0]. Let's see:\n\nOriginal first input row grouped into three pairs (since 6 elements to 3 outputs). For each pair:\n\n[4,4] \u2192 6\n\n[0,3] \u21926\n\n[3,0] \u21920.\n\nHmm, how does that happen? Wait, maybe if both elements in the pair are non-zero, their sum is divided by something. 4+4=8. 8 divided by... Not sure. Or maybe if both are non-zero, sum them and subtract 2? 4+4=8, 8-2=6. Let's check next pair [0,3]. One is zero. So perhaps if one is zero, take the non-zero one. 0+3=3, but output is 6. That doesn't fit. Wait, but the output for the first pair is 6. Maybe it's the sum of non-zero elements multiplied by 1.5? 4+4=8, 8*1.5=12? No. Not that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the number of non-zero elements in the pair multiplied by 3. For [4,4], 2 non-zero \u2192 2*3=6. For [0,3], 1 non-zero \u21921*3=3. But in the output, the second element is 6. Wait, in Example 0's first output row, second element is 6. Wait the input's second pair is [0,3], so maybe if either is non-zero, but how does that become 6? Maybe I'm missing something.\n\nWait, maybe the elements are grouped into triplets instead of pairs. Wait, input rows have 6 elements, output has 3. So 6 / 2 = 3. So pairs. Let me check another example. Example 1:\n\nInput:\n[4,0,4,3,3,0]\n[4,0,0,3,0,0]\n[0,0,4,3,0,0]\n\nOutput:\n[6,6,6]\n[6,0,0]\n[6,0,6]\n\nFirst input row: [4,0,4,3,3,0]. Group into pairs: [4,0], [4,3], [3,0]. Now output is [6,6,6]. Let's see. For the first pair [4,0], non-zero count is 1 \u2192 3. But output is 6. So that's not matching. Alternatively, maybe the sum of the pair, but if both are non-zero, add them and maybe do something else. Let's think: 4 and 0. One is zero, so sum is 4. But output is 6. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe the sum of each pair's digits, but that doesn't make sense. Or maybe, for each pair, if both are non-zero, then 6; otherwise, sum. Let's see in Example 0:\n\nFirst input row's pairs: [4,4] \u2192 both non-zero \u21926. Next pair [0,3] \u2192 one is zero. Sum is 3. But output is 6. That doesn't fit. So maybe not.\n\nWait, maybe the output is based on the presence of certain numbers. For example, in Example 0's input, the first pair is 4 and 4, which sum to 8. The output is 6. Maybe 8 minus 2? 6. Then next pair 0 and 3 sum to 3, but output is 6. That doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each pair is checked for whether they are the same. 4 and 4 are same \u21926. 0 and 3 are not \u2192 sum? But 0+3=3, but output is 6 again.\n\nThis approach isn't working. Let's look at another example. Example 2:\n\nInput:\n[0,0,4,0,3,0]\n[0,4,4,3,0,3]\n[4,4,0,0,0,3]\n\nOutput:\n[0,6,6]\n[6,6,6]\n[6,6,6]\n\nFirst input row: pairs [0,0], [4,0], [3,0]. Output is [0,6,6]. So [0,0] \u21920. [4,0] \u21926? Hmm. So when one is non-zero, maybe 6? But in Example 0's first input row, the second pair is [0,3], which is one non-zero and output is 6. Wait, but in Example 0's output first row, the second element is 6. So maybe whenever there's at least one non-zero in the pair, it's 6. But wait, how about in Example 0's third pair [3,0] \u2192 output is 0. But that's a pair with one non-zero. So that contradicts.\n\nWait, maybe the sum of the pair. If sum is even, 6; if odd, 3. Let's check:\n\nExample 0's first pair: 4+4=8 \u2192 even \u21926. Second pair 0+3=3 \u2192 odd \u21923. But output is 6. Doesn't fit. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, if the pair contains a 3 and a 0, maybe something else. Not sure.\n\nAnother approach: let's look at the outputs. All outputs consist of 0 and 6. So perhaps each output element is either 0 or 6, based on some condition of the pair.\n\nLooking at Example 0:\n\nInput pairs:\n\n[4,4] \u21926\n\n[0,3] \u21926\n\n[3,0] \u21920\n\nSo why is the third pair 0? Let's see. The third pair in input is [3,0]. The output is 0. But in the first pair [4,4], output is 6. So maybe when both elements are non-zero and the same, then 6. If one is non-zero, maybe 6 or 0 depending on something else. Or if either element is non-zero, but that doesn't explain why [3,0] is 0 in output.\n\nWait, let's check the other examples. Example 1's first input row: [4,0,4,3,3,0]. Pairs are [4,0], [4,3], [3,0]. Output is [6,6,6]. So [4,0] becomes 6. [4,3] becomes 6. [3,0] becomes 6. But in Example 0, the same [3,0] pair became 0. So why the difference?\n\nThis is confusing. Maybe the position in the row matters? Or perhaps the entire input is transformed across all three rows. Let's think in terms of the entire grid.\n\nLooking at Example 0's input:\n\nRow 1: [4,4,0,3,3,0]\n\nRow 2: [4,0,0,3,0,0]\n\nRow 3: [0,0,0,0,0,3]\n\nOutput:\n\n[6,6,0]\n\n[6,0,0]\n\n[0,0,6]\n\nPerhaps the output is derived by looking at the columns across the three input rows. For example, each output element is determined by a vertical triplet of numbers from the three input rows.\n\nWait, each input has 3 rows, each with 6 elements. Output is 3 rows of 3 elements. So maybe each output element corresponds to a group of three input elements (one from each row) in a column.\n\nFor example, the first output element of each row would be determined by the first two columns of the input. Let's check.\n\nIn Example 0's input:\n\nColumns 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.\n\nEach column has three elements (since there are three rows). Let's group the columns into pairs. Because the output has three elements per row, so 6 columns / 2 = 3 pairs.\n\nWait, maybe for each pair of columns in the input (columns 0 and 1, 2 and 3, 4 and 5), and for each of the three rows, check if there's a non-zero in either of those columns. If both are non-zero in a row, sum or something. Wait, perhaps for each pair of columns, the output is 6 if there's at least one non-zero in the three rows for those two columns, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, for each output element in row i, column j, look at the input row i's columns 2j and 2j+1. Then, if both are non-zero, output 6. If only one is non-zero, output 3. If both zero, 0. But in Example 0's first row: input columns 0 and 1 are 4 and 4. Both non-zero \u21926. Next pair (columns 2 and 3): 0 and 3. One non-zero \u21923, but output is 6. Hmm, that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, if any of the two elements in the pair (from the same row) is non-zero, output 6. So regardless of how many, as long as there's at least one non-zero, output 6. But in Example 0's first row, third pair (columns 4 and 5: 3 and 0) \u21926. But output is 0. So that doesn't work.\n\nWait, maybe the rule is that in a pair of elements (from the same row), if the sum is a multiple of 3, then output 6. Let's see:\n\nExample 0 first row pair [4,4] sum 8 \u2192 not multiple of 3. Output is 6. So that's not it.\n\nAlternatively, the product of the two elements. 4*4=16, 0*3=0, 3*0=0. But outputs are 6, 6, 0. Not sure.\n\nAlternative approach: look at the output rows. All outputs are 0, 6. Let's check how 6 is formed. Maybe 6 is the sum of 4 and 3, which are the two numbers present in the input. 4+3=7. Not 6. But 4+3-1=6. Not sure.\n\nLooking at Example 0's output, the first row is [6,6,0]. The input rows for that are [4,4,0,3,3,0], [4,0,0,3,0,0], [0,0,0,0,0,3]. Maybe for each output column, if the sum across all three input rows' corresponding pair is non-zero, then 6.\n\nWait, for output column 0 in Example 0's output first row: the input pairs for each row's first pair (columns 0 and 1) are:\n\nRow1: [4,4] sum 8\n\nRow2: [4,0] sum 4\n\nRow3: [0,0] sum 0\n\nTotal sum across rows for first pair: 8+4+0=12. 12/2=6. So output 6. Hmm. Maybe sum all the elements in the three input rows for each pair and divide by 2. Let's check:\n\nExample 0's first output element (6):\n\nSum for first pair (columns 0 and 1) across all rows: 4+4 (row1) +4+0 (row2) +0+0 (row3) = 4+4=8, 4+0=4, 0+0=0. Total 8+4=12. 12/2=6. So 6. Then second output element (6) corresponds to columns 2 and 3: row1 0+3=3, row2 0+3=3, row3 0+0=0. Sum 3+3+0=6. 6/2=3. But output is 6. Hmm, that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe sum all three rows' pairs and if any of the pairs in any row has a non-zero sum, then output 6. For example, first output column: in each of the three rows, their first pair (columns 0 and 1) sum. Row1:8, row2:4, row3:0. So sum across all three pairs: 8+4+0=12. Maybe 12 divided by 2 is 6. But the second output element would be (0+3)+(0+3)+(0+0) =6. 6/2=3. But output is 6.\n\nNot matching. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe for each output column, check if in any of the three input rows, both elements of the pair are non-zero. If yes, output 6; else, 0. Let's check:\n\nExample 0's first output column (6). For each input row's first pair:\n\nRow1: 4 and 4 \u2192 both non-zero.\n\nRow2:4 and 0 \u2192 only one non-zero.\n\nRow3:0 and 0 \u2192 none.\n\nSo since at least one row (row1) has both non-zero, output 6.\n\nSecond output column (6). Input pairs for columns 2-3:\n\nRow1:0 and3 \u2192 one non-zero.\n\nRow2:0 and3 \u2192 one non-zero.\n\nRow3:0 and0 \u2192 none.\n\nBut in output it's 6. But according to this rule, since no row has both elements non-zero here, the output should be 0. So this doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. Maybe the rule is different. Let's think about Example 1.\n\nExample 1's input:\n\nRow1: [4,0,4,3,3,0]\n\nRow2: [4,0,0,3,0,0]\n\nRow3: [0,0,4,3,0,0]\n\nOutput:\n\n[6,6,6]\n\n[6,0,0]\n\n[6,0,6]\n\nFirst output row [6,6,6]. Let's check the pairs:\n\nFirst pair (columns 0-1):\n\nRow1:4 and0 \u2192 one non-zero.\n\nRow2:4 and0 \u2192 same.\n\nRow3:0 and0 \u2192 none.\n\nBut output is 6. According to previous idea (if any row has both non-zero in the pair), but here none of the rows do. So that rule doesn't apply.\n\nAlternative idea: for each output element, it's 6 if there's a 4 and a 3 in the same pair. Wait, in the input pairs. Let's see:\n\nExample 0's first pair (4 and4): no 3. Output 6.\n\nNot sure. Alternatively, maybe if the pair contains 4 and 3, but that's not in the first pair.\n\nAlternative approach: look for patterns where each input row's pair is transformed into the output row's element. For example, each output row is generated by looking at the corresponding input row's pairs. Let's check.\n\nExample 0's first input row is [4,4,0,3,3,0]. Output is [6,6,0].\n\nGrouped into three pairs: (4,4), (0,3), (3,0). Output is 6,6,0.\n\nWhat's the pattern here? For (4,4), both non-zero, same numbers \u21926. For (0,3), one non-zero \u21926? For (3,0), one non-zero \u21920. Hmm, inconsistency.\n\nIn Example 1's first input row: pairs (4,0), (4,3), (3,0). Output is 6,6,6. So here, even pairs with one non-zero (like 4,0) lead to 6. So maybe the rule is that if the pair has at least one non-zero, the output is 6, but if both are zero, output 0. But that doesn't fit with Example 0's third pair (3,0), which has a non-zero but output is 0.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the sum of the pair's elements modulo something. For example, 4+4=8. 8 mod 7 is 1. Not helpful. Or 4+3=7 mod 6=1.\n\nHmm. Let's consider another angle. The outputs are all 0 and 6. 6 is 4+3-1, but I don't know. Maybe each occurrence of 4 and 3 in the input is converted to 6. For example, each 4 and 3 in a pair contribute to 6. Let's see.\n\nIn Example 0's first input row, pairs (4,4) \u2192 no 3, but output is 6. So that doesn't fit.\n\nWait, maybe each 4 and 3 in the same pair (regardless of order) sum to 7, which is not 6. So that's not it.\n\nAlternatively, the count of 4s and 3s in the input. But how?\n\nAnother idea: the output is created by combining two elements (from the input) in a way that each 4 becomes 3 and each 3 becomes 3, then multiplied by 2. But that doesn't make sense.\n\nWait, looking at Example 0's input and output:\n\nInput rows have 4 and 3. Output is 6. 4+3=7, not 6. Hmm. But maybe 4 and 3 are converted to 6 when they are in the same pair. But in Example 0's first pair, there are two 4s. So perhaps each 4 in the input contributes 3 to the output, and each 3 contributes 3. For example, 4+4=8, 8*0.75=6. But 3*2=6.\n\nAlternatively, the output is the count of 4s and 3s in the pair multiplied by 3. For example, pair (4,4) has two 4s \u2192 2*3=6. Pair (0,3) has one 3 \u21921*3=3. But output is 6. Doesn't fit.\n\nThis is getting frustrating. Let's try looking at the outputs for each example and see if there's a pattern in how they relate to their inputs.\n\nExample 0:\n\nInput row 1: [4,4,0,3,3,0] \u2192 output [6,6,0]\n\nInput row 2: [4,0,0,3,0,0] \u2192 [6,0,0]\n\nInput row 3: [0,0,0,0,0,3] \u2192 [0,0,6]\n\nSo for input row 1:\n\nEach pair is (4,4) \u21926, (0,3) \u21926, (3,0)\u21920. \n\nRow 3's pairs: (0,0) \u21920, (0,0)\u21920, (0,3)\u21926.\n\nHmm. So when the pair has a 3, maybe the output is 6? But in row1's third pair (3,0), output is 0. So that doesn't hold.\n\nAlternatively, in row1, the pairs (4,4) and (0,3) become 6, but (3,0) becomes 0. Maybe the direction matters. Like, if the pair is (x, y), then x and y are added in some way. For example, if x is 4 and y is 4 \u21926. If x is 0 and y is3 \u21926. If x is3 and y is0 \u21920. So the order matters here. So maybe it's the first element multiplied by the second element, then divided by something. For (4,4): 4*4=16. 16 mod 10=6? Not sure. (0*3)=0 \u2192 but output is6. That doesn't work.\n\nWait, maybe it's the sum of the digits. 4 and4 sum to8. 0 and3 sum to3. 3 and0 sum to3. But outputs are6,6,0. No connection.\n\nAlternatively, if the pair has two 4s, output 6. If the pair has a 0 and a3, output6. But if it's a3 and0, output0. That seems arbitrary, but maybe it's based on the order. But why?\n\nAlternatively, for each pair in the input row, if the first element is non-zero, then add 3 to the output. If the second is non-zero, add another 3. So, for (4,4) \u21923+3=6. (0,3) \u21920 +3=3. But output is6. So that doesn't fit.\n\nWait, but in Example0's first input row, (0,3) gives output6. So maybe if either element is non-zero, output6. But then why (3,0) gives0?\n\nWait, perhaps the output is 6 if the sum of the two elements is even, and 0 if odd. Let's check:\n\n(4,4) sum 8 \u2192 even \u21926. (0,3) sum3 \u2192 odd \u21920. But output is6. So no. Alternatively, even sum \u21920, odd sum \u21926. Doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. Maybe the pattern is that the output is 6 if the pair has any non-zero element, except when the pair is [3,0], then it's 0. But that seems too specific. Let's check other examples.\n\nExample1's input row1: [4,0,4,3,3,0]. Pairs (4,0) \u21926, (4,3)\u21926, (3,0)\u21926. So [3,0] in this case gives6. But in Example0, [3,0] gives0. So that rule doesn't work.\n\nAlternative idea: maybe the output for a pair is 6 if the sum of the two elements is divisible by 3. (4+4=8 \u21928 mod3= 2 \u2192 no. Output is6. So no.)\n\nAlternatively, the presence of certain numbers. Like, if a pair contains a4 and a3, output6. But in Example0's first pair, two4s output6. So maybe if a pair has any 4s or 3s, output6. But [0,3] has a3 \u21926. [3,0] has a3 \u2192 output0. Contradiction.\n\nAlternatively, the output is6 when the pair has a4 and/or a3, but only if the 3 comes after. For example, in Example0's second pair (0,3) \u21923 comes after \u21926. Third pair (3,0) \u21923 comes first \u21920. But then why in Example1's third pair (3,0) in the first input row, output is6. Because in Example1's first input row third pair is (3,0), output is6. Which contradicts.\n\nThis is really challenging. Let's think about the vertical alignment. Each input has three rows. Maybe each output cell is a sum of the three corresponding pairs in the input rows.\n\nFor example, for output column j in row i, look at the input row i's pair j, then sum or something.\n\nBut in Example0:\n\nOutput row1 is [6,6,0]. Input row1's pairs are [4,4], [0,3], [3,0]. If sum each pair: 8,3,3. But output is6,6,0. Not matching.\n\nAlternatively, multiply the elements. 4*4=16, 0*3=0, 3*0=0. Not matching.\n\nAlternatively, count the number of non-zero elements in the pair. For [4,4] \u21922 \u21926 (2*3). [0,3] \u21921 \u21923. But output is6. So no.\n\nWait, maybe each pair is converted to6 if there's at least one non-zero. But in Example0's third pair (3,0) \u2192 output0. But there's a non-zero here, so that's a contradiction.\n\nAnother angle: the output for each row is determined by the positions where 4s and3s are present. For example, whenever a4 is in an even position and a3 in an odd position, etc. But I can't see a pattern.\n\nLet's look at the test input:\n\nTest Input:\n\nRow1: [0,0,4,0,3,0]\n\nRow2: [0,4,0,3,3,3]\n\nRow3: [4,0,0,3,0,0]\n\nExpected Output: ?\n\nFollowing the previous examples, perhaps each output element is6 if the corresponding pair in the input has at least one non-zero in any of the three rows. Wait, but how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe for each output column (each pair of input columns), check if any of the three input rows have both elements in the pair non-zero. If yes, output6; otherwise,0.\n\nLet's test this with Example0:\n\nFor output column0 (input columns0-1):\n\nRow1's pair:4,4 \u2192 both non-zero. So output6.\n\nFor column1 (input columns2-3):\n\nRow1:0,3 \u2192 one non-zero.\n\nRow2:0,3 \u2192 one non-zero.\n\nRow3:0,0 \u2192 none.\n\nBut output is6. So this rule doesn't explain that.\n\nAlternatively, if any of the three rows has both elements non-zero in the pair, output6. Otherwise, sum the non-zero elements across all rows for that pair and if any, output6.\n\nWait, in Example0's column1:\n\nPairs across rows:\n\nRow1:0,3 \u2192 sum3\n\nRow2:0,3 \u2192 sum3\n\nRow3:0,0 \u2192 sum0\n\nTotal sum6. Maybe 6 \u2192 output6. So sum across all three rows' pairs for the same columns. If sum >=3, output6. Otherwise 0.\n\nBut let's check Example0:\n\nColumn0 sum:4+4 +4+0 +0+0 = 8+4=12 \u2192 sum12. Output6.\n\nColumn1 sum:0+3 +0+3 +0+0 =6 \u2192 output6.\n\nColumn2 sum:3+0 +0+0 +0+3=3+0+3=6 \u2192 output0 for row1's third element. Wait, but in output, row1's third element is0. Hmm, maybe this approach isn't right.\n\nAlternatively, for each output cell, look at the corresponding pair in the input row. If there's a 4 followed by a3 in any of the three rows for that pair, output6. Otherwise, 0. Not sure.\n\nAnother thought: the outputs are similar to a bitwise OR operation. If any element in the pair is non-zero, output6. But in Example0's third pair (3,0), output is0. So that's not the case.\n\nWait, perhaps the output is6 when the sum of the two elements in the pair is equal to or greater than 3, and 0 otherwise. Let's see:\n\nExample0 first pair:4+4=8 \u21926. Second pair0+3=3 \u21926. Third pair3+0=3 \u21926. But output third element is0. So no.\n\nAlternatively, if the sum is even, 6; else,0. 4+4=8 even \u21926. 0+3=3 odd \u21920. 3+0=3 \u21920. But output is6,6,0. So second element should be0 but it's6. Not matching.\n\nThis is really tough. Let me look for another pattern. The numbers in the input are either 0,3,4. Output is 0 or6. So perhaps 3+3=6, 4+2=6. Not sure.\n\nWait, maybe each 4 in the input is replaced with3 and each3 with3, and sum them in pairs. For example, in Example0's first pair:4 and4 \u21923+3=6. Second pair0 and3 \u21920+3=3 \u2192 output6. Wait, no. But output is6. So maybe sum all 4s and3s in the pair, each counted as3. So 4\u21923,3\u21923. So:\n\nExample0 first pair:4+4 \u21923+3=6. Output6. Second pair0+3\u21920+3=3. But output is6. Hmm. Not matching. But maybe sum of converted values, and if sum is >=3, output6.\n\nSo for 0+3:3 \u21926. 3+0:3 \u21926. But in Example0's third pair,3+0:3, output0. Doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, if the pair contains a4, output6. If it contains a3 and no4, output6. Else,0. So:\n\nExample0's first pair has4 \u21926. Second pair has3 \u21926. Third pair has3 and0 \u21926. But output is0. Contradicts.\n\nMaybe the rule is that the output is6 if the pair contains a4 in any row, and3 in another. But this is getting too complicated.\n\nLet me try to think of the test input and see if I can find a pattern there, and then backtrack.\n\nTest input:\n\nRow1: [0,0,4,0,3,0]\n\nRow2: [0,4,0,3,3,3]\n\nRow3: [4,0,0,3,0,0]\n\nLet's group into pairs per row:\n\nRow1: (0,0), (4,0), (3,0)\n\nRow2: (0,4), (0,3), (3,3)\n\nRow3: (4,0), (0,3), (0,0)\n\nLooking at other examples' outputs, it seems that when a pair in any row has both elements non-zero, the output for that column is6. So perhaps for each output column j (which corresponds to pairs j in each row), if any of the three rows has both elements non-zero in that pair, then output6. Otherwise, 0.\n\nLet's test this with Example0:\n\nExample0's input pairs for column0:\n\nRow1:4,4 \u2192 both non-zero \u21926.\n\nRow2:4,0 \u2192 one non-zero.\n\nRow3:0,0 \u2192 none.\n\nSo since at least one row has both non-zero, output6.\n\nFor column1 pairs:\n\nRow1:0,3 \u2192 one non-zero.\n\nRow2:0,3 \u2192 one non-zero.\n\nRow3:0,0 \u2192 none.\n\nNo rows have both non-zero here. So output should be0, but in Example0, output is6. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, if any of the pairs in any row has non-zero elements (regardless of how many), then output6. But Example0's third pair in row1 is3,0 \u2192 output is0. So that's not the case.\n\nHmm.\n\nWait, maybe the output is generated by combining the pairs vertically. For each output column j, look at the three pairs from each row's j-th pair. If any of those pairs (from any row) has both elements non-zero, then output6 for that column in all rows. Otherwise, it's0.\n\nWait, not sure. Let's look at Example0's output. The first output column is6 in all rows. Because row1's first pair is both non-zero. But the output for row1 is6, row2 is6, row3 is0. So this doesn't fit.\n\nThis is really tricky. Let's try to see if there's a pattern in the numbers across all examples. All output values are 0 or6, and inputs have 0,3,4. So 3+3=6, 4+something=6. 4+2=6. But inputs don't have 2.\n\nAlternatively, each 4 and 3 is counted as contributing 3 towards the output. So for a pair, sum the number of 4s and 3s, then multiply by3. So:\n\nExample0's first pair: two4s \u21922*3=6.\n\nSecond pair: one3 \u21921*3=3 \u2192 output6. Hmm, no.\n\nAlternatively, count the number of non-zero elements in all three pairs (across rows) for that column, multiply by3. But Example0's first column: row1 has two non-zero, row2 has one, row3 has zero. Total non-zero elements:3. 3*3=9. Output is6.\n\nNot helpful.\n\nWait, maybe the output is 6 if the total sum of the three pairs (across all rows) for that column is divisible by6. Let's see:\n\nExample0's first column:\n\nRow1's pair sum:4+4=8\n\nRow2's pair sum:4+0=4\n\nRow3's pair sum:0+0=0\n\nTotal sum:8+4=12. 12 is divisible by6 \u219212/6=2. Output is6. So maybe 6 multiplied by the number of times the sum is divisible by6. Not sure.\n\nExample0's second column sum:0+3 +0+3 +0+0 =6 \u21926/6=1 \u21926*1=6. Output is6.\n\nThird column sum:3+0 +0+0 +0+3=6 \u21926/6=1 \u21926. But output for row1's third element is0, row2's third element is0, row3's is6. So this approach isn't matching.\n\nI'm stuck. Let me look at the output for the test input and see if I can find a pattern.\n\nTest input:\n\nRow1: (0,0), (4,0), (3,0)\n\nRow2: (0,4), (0,3), (3,3)\n\nRow3: (4,0), (0,3), (0,0)\n\nLooking at other examples, perhaps each output element is 6 if the corresponding pair in the same row has at least one non-zero and the pair in the same column in the row below has a certain pattern. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, for each output element, it's 6 if the pair in the same row and column has at least one non-zero, and either the pair below it has a non-zero in a certain way. But this seems too vague.\n\nWait, looking at Example3:\n\nInput:\n\n[4,4,0,3,0,0]\n\n[0,0,0,0,0,3]\n\n[4,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nOutput:\n\n[6,6,0]\n\n[0,0,6]\n\n[6,0,0]\n\nInput row1's pairs: (4,4), (0,3), (0,0). Output [6,6,0].\n\nRow2's pairs: (0,0), (0,0), (0,3). Output [0,0,6].\n\nRow3's pairs: (4,0), (0,0), (0,0). Output [6,0,0].\n\nSo, for each row's pair, if any element is non-zero, output6. But row1's third pair (0,0) outputs0. That fits. Row2's third pair (0,3) outputs6. So in this example, it seems like the output is6 if the pair has at least one non-zero. But in Example0, row1's third pair (3,0) outputs0. So this contradicts.\n\nWait, but in Example3's row1's third pair is (0,0), which outputs0. Row3's first pair (4,0) outputs6.\n\nBut in Example0's row1's third pair (3,0) outputs0. But according to this rule, since there's a non-zero, it should be6.\n\nSo this approach is inconsistent.\n\nAlternative idea: the output is6 for a pair if the sum of the elements in the pair is divisible by a certain number, but varies per row. Not sure.\n\nAnother observation: in all the output examples, the output rows have the same length as the number of rows in the input. For example, three input rows \u2192 three output rows. Each output row has three elements, corresponding to three pairs of the input rows.\n\nWait, maybe each output row is generated by combining the pairs from the input rows. For example, output row1 is generated from input row1's pairs, row2 from row2's pairs, etc.\n\nIn Example0's row1: [4,4,0,3,3,0] \u2192 pairs (4,4), (0,3), (3,0). Output row1: [6,6,0].\n\nSo perhaps for each pair in the input row, if both elements are non-zero and equal, output6. Otherwise, if one element is non-zero, output6 if it's the first element, else0. But how?\n\n(4,4) \u21926.\n\n(0,3) \u21926. Because the second element is non-zero?\n\n(3,0) \u21920. Because the first element is non-zero but the second is zero.\n\nBut then in Example1's row1, pair (4,0) \u21926. So first element is non-zero, output6.\n\nPair (4,3) \u21926. Both non-zero, different values. So previous rule doesn't apply.\n\nHmm. Maybe the rule is: for each pair, output6 if the first element is non-zero, regardless of the second. So:\n\n(4,4) \u2192 first non-zero \u21926.\n\n(0,3) \u2192 second non-zero \u21920. But output is6. So no.\n\nAlternatively, output6 if either element is non-zero. So:\n\n(4,4) \u21926.\n\n(0,3) \u21926.\n\n(3,0) \u21926.\n\nBut Example0's output third element is0. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, output6 if the pair has at least one non-zero and the pair is not (3,0). But that's arbitrary.\n\nThis is getting me nowhere. Let me think of another approach.\n\nLooking at the test input:\n\nRow1 pairs: (0,0), (4,0), (3,0)\n\nRow2 pairs: (0,4), (0,3), (3,3)\n\nRow3 pairs: (4,0), (0,3), (0,0)\n\nPossible output per row:\n\nRow1: [0,6,6] if rule is that each pair with a non-zero first element is6, else0. But (4,0) would be6, (3,0) would be6. So [0,6,6]. But row2's pairs: (0,4) \u21920, (0,3)\u21920, (3,3)\u21926. Output [0,0,6]. Row3's pairs: (4,0) \u21926, (0,3)\u21920, (0,0)\u21920. So [6,0,0]. But looking at the training examples, this might not match.\n\nAlternatively, for each pair, output6 if any of the elements is a4. So:\n\nRow1 pairs: (0,0) \u21920, (4,0)\u21926, (3,0)\u21920. So [0,6,0].\n\nRow2: (0,4) \u21926, (0,3)\u21920, (3,3)\u21920. [6,0,0].\n\nRow3: (4,0)\u21926, (0,3)\u21920, (0,0)\u21920. [6,0,0].\n\nBut this doesn't match any of the training examples.\n\nAlternatively, output6 for each pair that contains a4 or a3. So:\n\nRow1 pairs: (0,0) \u21920, (4,0)\u21926, (3,0)\u21926. Output [0,6,6].\n\nRow2: (0,4)\u21926, (0,3)\u21926, (3,3)\u21926. [6,6,6].\n\nRow3: (4,0)\u21926, (0,3)\u21926, (0,0)\u21920. [6,6,0].\n\nBut comparing to training examples, this might not fit. For instance, Example0's row1 third pair (3,0) would output6, but in the example, it's0.\n\nSo this approach is incorrect.\n\nAnother idea: the output for a pair is6 if the sum of the pair's elements is greater than or equal to3. For example:\n\nRow1 in test input:\n\n(0,0) \u21920 \u21920.\n\n(4,0)\u21924 \u21926.\n\n(3,0)\u21923 \u21926.\n\nSo output [0,6,6].\n\nRow2: (0,4)\u21924\u21926. (0,3)\u21923\u21926. (3,3)\u21926\u21926. Output [6,6,6].\n\nRow3: (4,0)\u21924\u21926. (0,3)\u21923\u21926. (0,0)\u21920\u21920. Output [6,6,0].\n\nBut this doesn't match the training examples. For Example0's row1 third pair (3,0) sum3 \u21926, but output is0. So this is invalid.\n\nAt this point, I'm stuck. Maybe the pattern is that each pair is transformed by adding the numbers and converting 4 to 3 and 3 to3, then summing. For example, 4 becomes3, 3 remains3. So:\n\nFor pair (4,4) \u21923+3=6.\n\nPair (0,3) \u21920+3=3 \u2192 output6 (if sum >=3).\n\nPair (3,0) \u21923+0=3 \u2192 output6.\n\nBut in Example0's row1 third pair, output is0. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, if the sum is even, output6; else,0. (4+4=8 even\u21926. 0+3=3 odd\u21920. 3+0=3\u21920. So output [6,0,0], but Example0's row1 output is [6,6,0]. So no.\n\nI think I'm missing a key insight here. Let me look at the output examples again.\n\nExample0's output:\n\n[6,6,0]\n\n[6,0,0]\n\n[0,0,6]\n\nExample1's output:\n\n[6,6,6]\n\n[6,0,0]\n\n[6,0,6]\n\nExample2's output:\n\n[0,6,6]\n\n[6,6,6]\n\n[6,6,6]\n\nExample3's output:\n\n[6,6,0]\n\n[0,0,6]\n\n[6,0,0]\n\nExample4's output:\n\n[0,6,0]\n\n[6,0,0]\n\n[6,6,6]\n\nLooking at the test input, perhaps the output for each pair is6 if there's a 4 in the same position in any of the rows. For example, in the test input's first column pairs:\n\nRow1: (0,0)\n\nRow2: (0,4)\n\nRow3: (4,0)\n\nSo, in column0 pairs across rows, there are 4s in row2 and row3. So output column0 for each row is6. But in Example0's column0, output is6 for all rows. So maybe this is a vertical check. If any row in the column pair has a4 or a3, output6 for all rows. But that doesn't fit with other examples.\n\nAlternatively, for each vertical column of pairs (across the three input rows), if there's a4 and a3 present in the same pair column across any row, output6. For example, in test input's column0 pairs:\n\nRow2 has (0,4) which has a4.\n\nRow3 has (4,0) which has a4.\n\nSo column0 in output for all rows is6.\n\nIn Example0's column0:\n\nRow1 has (4,4) \u21924.\n\nRow2 has (4,0) \u21924.\n\nRow3 has (0,0) \u21920.\n\nSo column0 output is6 for all rows.\n\nThis seems possible. Then, for each vertical column of pairs, if any of the pairs in that column contains a4 or a3, output6 for all rows in that column. Otherwise,0.\n\nTesting this with Example0:\n\nColumn0: contains4 in row1 and row2 \u2192 output6 for all rows.\n\nColumn1:\n\nRow1 has (0,3) \u21923.\n\nRow2 has (0,3) \u21923.\n\nRow3 has (0,0) \u21920.\n\nSo column1 has3s \u2192 output6 for all rows.\n\nColumn2:\n\nRow1 has (3,0) \u21923.\n\nRow2 has (0,0) \u21920.\n\nRow3 has (0,3) \u21923.\n\nSo column2 has3s \u2192 output6 for all rows. But Example0's output for column2 is0,6,6. So this doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. Not quite.\n\nAnother approach: the output for each column is6 if the sum of all elements in that column's pairs (across all three rows) is divisible by3. But in Example0's column0:\n\nSum of pairs:4+4 (row1) +4+0 (row2) +0+0 (row3) =8+4=12. 12/3=4 \u2192 output6. But 12/3=4, which doesn't relate to6. Maybe sum divided by 2? 12/2=6. That gives6. Column1 sum:0+3+0+3+0+0=6. 6/2=3 \u2192 output6. Column2 sum:3+0+0+0+0+3=6. 6/2=3 \u2192 output0. But in Example0's output, column2's elements are0,0,6. So this doesn't fit.\n\nWait, if the sum of all elements in the column's pairs is divided by2, then:\n\nColumn0:12 \u21926. Output6.\n\nColumn1:6 \u21923. Output6.\n\nColumn2:6 \u21923. Output0.\n\nBut Example0's output column1 is6, column2 is0. So this doesn't match.\n\nI think I'm missing the key pattern. Let me try to look for a different angle. All outputs are made of 6s and 0s, which suggests a binary condition: either 6 or 0. The inputs have 0,3,4. Maybe each 4 and 3 is transformed into 3, and then the sum of each pair is multiplied by2. For example:\n\nPair (4,4): 3+3=6 \u21926*1=6.\n\nPair (0,3):0+3=3 \u21923*2=6.\n\nPair (3,0):3+0=3 \u21923*2=6. But in Example0, this pair outputs0. So no.\n\nAlternatively, if a pair has both elements as4 or3, output6. Otherwise,0. But (4,4) \u21926. (0,3) \u21920. (3,0) \u21920. But Example0's output for (0,3) is6.\n\nThis is really challenging. Given that I'm stuck, I'll try to make an educated guess based on the examples. \n\nLooking at the test input and the examples, perhaps the output for each pair is6 if there's at least one 4 or 3 in the pair, and0 otherwise. But in Example0's third pair (3,0), it has a3, so output should be6, but it's0. So this rule doesn't work.\n\nAnother possibility: the output is6 if the pair contains a4 and a3, regardless of order. But in Example0's first pair (4,4), there's no3, so output should be0, but it's6. So no.\n\nAlternatively, if the pair contains a4, output6. If it contains a3, output6. So any pair with 4 or3 \u21926. So:\n\nTest input row1's pairs:\n\n(0,0) \u21920.\n\n(4,0) \u21926.\n\n(3,0) \u21926.\n\nOutput row1: [0,6,6].\n\nRow2's pairs:\n\n(0,4) \u21926.\n\n(0,3) \u21926.\n\n(3,3) \u21926.\n\nOutput row2: [6,6,6].\n\nRow3's pairs:\n\n(4,0) \u21926.\n\n(0,3) \u21926.\n\n(0,0) \u21920.\n\nOutput row3: [6,6,0].\n\nBut looking at Example0's row1 third pair (3,0), which would output6, but in the example, it's0. So this doesn't fit.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and not finding the pattern, I'll try to look for a pattern in the test input and see what the output might be.\n\nTest input rows grouped into pairs:\n\nRow1: (0,0), (4,0), (3,0)\n\nRow2: (0,4), (0,3), (3,3)\n\nRow3: (4,0), (0,3), (0,0)\n\nLooking at Example2's input and output:\n\nExample2's input:\n\nRow1: [0,0,4,0,3,0]\n\nRow2: [0,4,4,3,0,3]\n\nRow3: [4,4,0,0,0,3]\n\nOutput:\n\n[0,6,6]\n\n[6,6,6]\n\n[6,6,6]\n\nIn Example2's first row, the pairs are (0,0), (4,0), (3,0). The output is [0,6,6]. So for (0,0) \u21920, (4,0) \u21926, (3,0) \u21926. This matches the idea that if either element is non-zero, output6. So why in Example0's third pair (3,0) the output is0. \n\nThis suggests that the rule might be different. Maybe if the pair is (4,0) \u21926, (3,0)\u21920. But why?\n\nLooking at Example3's input:\n\nRow1: [4,4,0,3,0,0] \u2192 pairs (4,4), (0,3), (0,0). Output [6,6,0].\n\nRow2: [0,0,0,0,0,3] \u2192 pairs (0,0), (0,0), (0,3). Output [0,0,6].\n\nRow3: [4,0,0,0,0,0] \u2192 pairs (4,0), (0,0), (0,0). Output [6,0,0].\n\nHere, (4,4) \u21926, (0,3) \u21926, (0,3) \u21926. So (0,3) becomes6. But in Example0's third pair (3,0), output is0. So the order matters. Maybe if the pair is (a, b), and a is4 or3 and b is non-zero, then6. Or something like that.\n\nAlternatively, the output is6 if the pair contains a4 in the first position or a3 in the second position. So:\n\n(4,4) \u21926.\n\n(0,3) \u21926.\n\n(3,0) \u21920.\n\nWhich fits Example0's first row. Let's test this:\n\nExample0's first row pairs:\n\n(4,4) \u21926.\n\n(0,3) \u21926.\n\n(3,0) \u21920.\n\nOutput matches.\n\nExample1's first row pairs:\n\n(4,0) \u21924 in first position \u21926.\n\n(4,3) \u21924 in first \u21926.\n\n(3,0) \u21923 in first \u21920. But output is6. So this doesn't fit.\n\nThis approach doesn't work.\n\nAnother possible rule: the output is6 if the pair has a4 in the first element or a3 in the second element. So:\n\n(4,4) \u21926.\n\n(0,3) \u21923 in second \u21926.\n\n(3,0) \u21923 in first and 0 in second \u21926. But in Example0, output is0. Contradicts.\n\nI'm really stuck here. Maybe the answer for the test input is:\n\n[0,6,6]\n\n[6,6,6]\n\n[6,6,0]\n\nBut I'm not sure. Alternatively, based on Example2's similar input, the test output might be:\n\n[0,6,6]\n\n[6,6,6]\n\n[6,6,6]\n\nBut this is just a guess.\n\nAnother way to look at it: the output for each pair is6 if the pair contains a4 and/or a3, except when it's (3,0), which becomes0. But in Example1's third pair (3,0), output is6, which contradicts.\n\nAt this point, I think I have to make an educated guess based on the examples, even though I can't find the exact pattern. Looking at the test input's pairs:\n\nFor each row:\n\nRow1: (0,0), (4,0), (3,0)\n\nRow2: (0,4), (0,3), (3,3)\n\nRow3: (4,0), (0,3), (0,0)\n\nLooking at Example2's output, which has similar pairs, the output might be:\n\nRow1: 0 (for (0,0)), 6 (for (4,0)), 6 (for (3,0)) \u2192 [0,6,6]\n\nRow2: 6 (0,4), 6 (0,3), 6 (3,3) \u2192 [6,6,6]\n\nRow3:6 (4,0),6 (0,3),0 (0,0) \u2192 [6,6,0]\n\nSo the output would be:\n\n[0,6,6]\n\n[6,6,6]\n\n[6,6,0]\n\nBut I'm not sure. Another example to check: Example4's input has a pair (0,0) in row1, which outputs0. So this fits.\n\nAlternatively, the output is6 for any pair that has a4 or a3. So for test input:\n\nRow1: (0,0) \u21920, (4,0) \u21926, (3,0) \u21926 \u2192 [0,6,6]\n\nRow2: (0,4) \u21926, (0,3) \u21926, (3,3) \u21926 \u2192 [6,6,6]\n\nRow3: (4,0) \u21926, (0,3) \u21926, (0,0) \u21920 \u2192 [6,6,0]\n\nThis matches the structure of some examples like Example2. Therefore, I'll go with this as the answer."
