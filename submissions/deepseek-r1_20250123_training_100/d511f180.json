        "cot_1": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. So, looking at the training examples, I need to understand how the input arrays are transformed into the output. Let's start by examining the first example.\n\nIn Example 0, the input is a 5x5 grid. The output looks like some sort of rotation or shifting, but maybe not a simple one. Let me check each row. The first input row is [2,7,8,8,8], and the output is [2,7,5,5,5]. Wait, where do those 5s come from? Let me check the second input row which is [5,5,6,5,4]. The output's second row is [8,8,6,8,4]. Hmm, the 6 and 4 are the same, but the first three elements are 8,8,6. Wait, maybe elements are being moved from adjacent rows.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a shift where each row's elements are taken from the next row in some way. Let's look at the first element of each row in input and output. For example 0's input:\n\nRow 0: 2,7,8,8,8\n\nRow 1:5,5,6,5,4\n\nRow 2:8,5,5,5,2\n\nRow3:8,8,4,3,6\n\nRow4:6,5,1,9,3\n\nThe output rows:\n\nRow0:2,7,5,5,5\n\nRow1:8,8,6,8,4\n\nRow2:5,8,8,8,2\n\nRow3:5,5,4,3,6\n\nRow4:6,8,1,9,3\n\nLooking at output row0, the first two elements are same as input row0. Then the next three elements (5,5,5) might come from the row below (input row1's first three elements are 5,5,6). But in output row0, it's 5,5,5. So maybe the third element of row0 is taken from row1's first element. Then maybe each row is combining elements from the row above or below? Alternatively, perhaps the grid is being rotated or elements are being shifted upwards.\n\nAnother approach: check if there's a diagonal or spiral pattern. Let's see for example 1. Input is 3x3:\n\nInput:\n\n3,5,1\n\n4,5,8\n\n2,4,9\n\nOutput:\n\n3,8,1\n\n4,8,5\n\n2,4,9\n\nHmm. The middle element in the output's second row is 8. Let's see where that 8 comes from. In the input, the middle element of row1 is 5. The output row1 is [4,8,5]. So the 8 here might be coming from the element above and to the right, which is input row0's third element (1) or maybe input row1's third element (8). Wait, output row0's middle element is 8. Wait, input row0's middle is 5, output row0's middle is 8. So where is 8 coming from? Let's check input row1's third element is 8, which is in the same column as output row0's middle. So maybe each element is shifted from the row below in a specific way.\n\nLooking at example1's output:\n\nFirst row output: [3,8,1]. Input's first row is [3,5,1]. The middle element changed from 5 to 8. The 8 comes from input's second row's third element (8) perhaps. So maybe the element at (i,j) in output is taken from the element below (i+1,j) or something. Alternatively, maybe each element is replaced with the maximum of certain neighbors.\n\nIn example1's output row0, the 8 is in position (0,1). Input's row1, position (1,2) is 8. So maybe taking elements from the next row's next column? Or maybe a clockwise rotation of the outer elements.\n\nWait, example1's output:\n\nOriginal input:\n\nRow0:3,5,1\n\nRow1:4,5,8\n\nRow2:2,4,9\n\nOutput:\n\nRow0:3,8,1\n\nRow1:4,8,5\n\nRow2:2,4,9\n\nSo the middle of row0 is now 8 (from input row1's 8?), row1's third element is 5 (from input row0's 5?), and row1's middle is 8 (from input row2's element? Not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's a rotation of the perimeter. Let's see the perimeter elements:\n\nOriginal input's perimeter is 3,5,1,8,9,4,2,4.\n\nBut the output's perimeter for example1 is 3,8,1,5,9,4,2,4. Wait, not sure. Alternatively, maybe the pattern is that each element (except the corners?) is being replaced by the element from the position below and to the right, or some similar shifting.\n\nLooking at example2:\n\nInput:\n\n6,5,3\n\n5,7,5\n\n8,8,2\n\nOutput:\n\n6,8,3\n\n8,7,8\n\n5,5,2\n\nSo in output row0: 6,8,3. Middle element is 8. Where does that come from? Input row1's first element is 5, but output row0's middle is 8. Wait, input row2's first two elements are 8,8. So perhaps elements are being taken from the row below. For example, in output row0, the middle element 8 could be from input row1's middle (7) or maybe from row2's elements. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's a clockwise rotation of the matrix layers. Let's see. For example0, which is 5x5. Rotating the outer layer clockwise. But the output for example0's first row is [2,7,5,5,5], which seems like the original first row's first two elements (2,7), then three 5s. But the original second row starts with 5,5,6. So maybe the outer layers are rotated but not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that each row (except the last) is shifted in a way that their elements are replaced by elements from the row below. Let's check example1's input and output.\n\nInput row0:3,5,1 \u2192 output row0:3,8,1. The middle element 5 becomes 8. Input row1 has an 8 in the third position, but output's 8 is in row0's middle. Maybe it's taking from row1's next element. Let's see, input row1:4,5,8. So output row0's middle is 8, which is row1's third element.\n\nSimilarly, output row1's third element is 5, which is input row0's middle element (5). So maybe there's a swap between elements from adjacent rows. For instance, row i's j-th element is swapped with row i+1's (j+1) mod len element? Not sure.\n\nWait, in example1:\n\nOriginal input row0: [3,5,1]\n\nrow1: [4,5,8]\n\nrow2: [2,4,9]\n\nOutput row0: [3,8,1] \u2192 the middle element 5 is replaced by 8, which is row1's third element.\n\nOutput row1: [4,8,5] \u2192 middle element 5 becomes 8 (from where?), and third element is 5 from row0's middle.\n\nWait, maybe each element (except the first column) is replaced by the element from the row below and previous column. For example, in example1's output row0, the middle element (j=1) is taken from input row1's j=2 (which is 8). Then output row1's middle element (j=1) is taken from input row2's j=2 (which is 9?), but in the output it's 8. Hmm, that doesn't fit. Maybe it's a different pattern.\n\nLooking at example2's input:\n\nRow0:6,5,3\n\nRow1:5,7,5\n\nRow2:8,8,2\n\nOutput:\n\nRow0:6,8,3 \u2192 middle element 5 becomes 8, which is row2's first element (8) perhaps?\n\nRow1:8,7,8 \u2192 first element 5 becomes 8 (from row2's first element?), middle remains 7, third element 5 becomes 8 (from row2's second element?)\n\nRow2:5,5,2 \u2192 first two elements are 5,5. Input row1's first two elements were 5,7. So maybe those elements are shifted down from row1 to row2.\n\nHmm, perhaps the transformation is that each element (except the first row and last row) is moved upward or downward. Alternatively, maybe the non-border elements are rotated in some way.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider that in each example, the output is created by rotating certain parts of the input matrix. For example, in example0, the output has the first two elements of row0 as original, then the next three elements come from the row below. But this is a bit unclear.\n\nAnother approach: look for the movement of specific elements. For instance, in example0's output, the first row's third element is 5, which was in the row below (input row1's first element is 5). Similarly, in example1's output, the middle element of row0 is 8, which was in the row1's third element. So maybe each element in position (i,j) is replaced by the element from (i+1, j+1), wrapping around if necessary. But in example0's first row, third element is 5 from row1's first element. So (0,2) becomes (1,0). That's a shift of i+1, j-2. Hmm, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, it's possible that each element is shifted clockwise along the perimeter. For example, in example1's 3x3 matrix, the perimeter elements are 3,5,1,8,9,4,2,4. Rotating them clockwise by one would shift each to the next position. Let's see:\n\nOriginal perimeter (assuming we take them in order):\n\nTop row left to right:3,5,1\n\nRight column top to bottom:1,8,9\n\nBottom row right to left:9,4,2\n\nLeft column bottom to top:2,4,3 (but original left column is 3,4,2. Wait, maybe I'm getting the order wrong. For a 3x3, the perimeter is first row left to right (3,5,1), then right column down (8,9), then bottom row right to left (4,2), then left column up (4,3). So the perimeter elements are 3,5,1,8,9,4,2,4. Rotating them clockwise by one would make the last element (4) move to first position. So the new perimeter would be 4,3,5,1,8,9,4,2. Let's see the output perimeter:\n\nOutput's first row is 3,8,1. So the first element is still 3. Second element is 8. Third is 1. Then right column:1,5,9. Then bottom row:9,4,2. Left column:2,4,3. Hmm, this doesn't fit. So maybe that's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that the matrix is rotated 90 degrees, but then again, the output doesn't look like a rotation. For example, in example0's input, a 5x5 matrix, the output's first row starts with 2,7 (same as input's first row), but then the next three elements are 5,5,5. So that's not a rotation.\n\nAnother approach: look for each position (i,j) in the output and see where the value comes from in the input.\n\nTake example0:\n\nOutput row0: [2,7,5,5,5]\n\nInput row0: [2,7,8,8,8]\n\nSo positions 0,1 are same. Positions 2,3,4 are 5,5,5. Where do these 5s come from? The input row1's first three elements are 5,5,6. So output row0's positions 2,3,4 are 5,5,5. So maybe row0's elements from column 2 onwards are replaced by row1's elements from columns 0,1,2. But 5,5,6 would give 5,5,6, but output is 5,5,5. Hmm, that doesn't match. Maybe shifted left? Or perhaps a different pattern.\n\nWait, example0's output row1 is [8,8,6,8,4]. Input row2 is [8,5,5,5,2]. Output row1's first two elements are 8,8. Input row2's first element is 8. So maybe each row (except the last) takes some elements from the row below. For example, row0 in output takes elements 2,7 (from itself) and then 5,5,5 from row1's elements. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe each row is shifted up by one, and the last row wraps around. But example0's last row in output is [6,8,1,9,3]. The input's last row is [6,5,1,9,3]. The second element is 8 instead of 5. Where does 8 come from? The input row3 has 8,8,4,3,6. So maybe the 8 is from row3's first element. So perhaps each element (except first row's first two) is taken from the row below, but with some offset.\n\nThis is getting a bit confusing. Let me try to see if there's a common pattern across all examples.\n\nLooking at example1, example2, and example0:\n\nIn example1's output, the middle element of row0 is 8, which was in row1's third position. The middle of row1 is 8, which was not present in input. Wait, input row2's middle is 4, so not sure.\n\nIn example2's output, the first element of row1 is 8, which was in row2's first element. The middle element of row0 is 8, which is from row2's first element. So perhaps elements are being moved upward from two rows below?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the elements in even rows are shifted right and elements in odd rows shifted left. Not sure.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps each element is replaced by the maximum value in its neighboring cells. Let's check example1. For output row0, middle element 8. Its neighbors would be input elements: up (nothing), left 3, right 1, down 5. But the maximum is 5, not 8. So that's not it.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the elements are mirrored along some axis. For example, in example1's output, the middle row becomes [4,8,5]. Original was [4,5,8]. So it's reversed. But row0's output is [3,8,1], which is similar to input row0 except middle element is replaced by input row1's third element. So maybe the middle element is swapped with the element below and to the right?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that each row is shifted to the right by one, but the shifted element comes from the row below. For example, in example0's first row, after the first two elements, the next three come from the row below. But how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is that for each cell (i,j), if i + j is even, then the cell remains the same, otherwise it's replaced by some other cell's value. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, let's look for the movement of specific numbers. For example, in example0's input, the number 8 appears multiple times. The output has some 8s shifted. Maybe the 8s are moving in a certain direction.\n\nWait, perhaps the pattern is that each element is shifted diagonally upwards to the right. For example, for cell (i,j), the new value comes from (i+1, j-1) or (i-1, j+1). Let's check example1's output.\n\nIn example1's output row0, column1 is 8. Input's row1, column2 is 8. So (0,1) in output is (1,2) in input. That's a difference of i+1, j+1. So perhaps cell (i,j) in output is (i+1, j+1) in input. But for (0,1) in output, the input is (1,2). So that's possible. But let's check another cell. For output row1, column2 is 5. Input row0, column1 is 5. So (1,2) in output is (0,1) in input. So that would be a difference of i-1, j-1.\n\nHmm, maybe it's a cycle where each element is shifted to the next position in a certain direction. For example, each element moves to the position to the right and down, wrapping around. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's a clockwise spiral rotation. For instance, the outermost elements are rotated clockwise by one position, then the next layer, etc. Let's try this with example1.\n\nExample1's input is:\n\n3 5 1\n\n4 5 8\n\n2 4 9\n\nThe outermost elements are 3,5,1,8,9,4,2,4.\n\nIf we rotate them clockwise by one, the new perimeter would be 4,3,5,1,8,9,4,2. Let's arrange them into the output rows.\n\nOutput row0:3,8,1 \u2192 but according to the rotated perimeter, the first three elements should be 4,3,5. Which doesn't match. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAnother approach: looking at example0's output, the first two elements of row0 are the same as input. Then the next three elements are 5,5,5. Which are the first three elements of row1 in the input. So row0's elements after position 1 are replaced by row1's elements. Similarly, row1's output starts with 8,8,6,8,4. The first two elements are 8,8 which are from row2's first two elements (8,5). Wait, but input row2 starts with 8,5. Output row1 starts with 8,8. So not exactly matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that each row (starting from the second row) is shifted upwards by one, and the last row becomes a combination. But not sure.\n\nLooking at example2's input and output:\n\nInput:\n\nRow0:6,5,3\n\nRow1:5,7,5\n\nRow2:8,8,2\n\nOutput:\n\nRow0:6,8,3\n\nRow1:8,7,8\n\nRow2:5,5,2\n\nSo output row0's middle is 8, which is row2's first element (8). Row1's first element is 8 (row2's first element?), but row1's third element is 8 (row2's second element?). Row2's first element is 5, which is row1's first element (5).\n\nSo perhaps each element is being replaced by the element below it. But for row0, middle becomes row1's element. Wait, in example2's output row0, the middle element is 8, which is input row2's first element. Hmm, that's a diagonal shift. Maybe elements are being shifted down and to the left or right.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's a pattern where each element is replaced by the element diagonally down and to the right. For example, (i,j) in output becomes (i+1, j+1) from input. Let's check:\n\nFor example2's output row0, column1 is 8. Input row1, column2 is 5. So no.\n\nBut row0's 8 is from input row2's column0 (8). So (0,1) in output is (2,0) in input. That's a big jump. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's a combination of shifting rows and columns. For instance, each row is shifted left by its index. But example0 has 5 rows. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation involves swapping elements in a particular way. For example, swapping elements in a cross pattern. But how?\n\nAnother idea: looking at example0's output row3: [5,5,4,3,6]. The input row3 is [8,8,4,3,6]. So the first two elements changed from 8,8 to 5,5. Where do those 5s come from? Input row2's first element is 8, but output row3's first two are 5,5. Hmm, maybe from row2's elements. Input row2 has [8,5,5,5,2]. So maybe the 5s are taken from row2's elements. But how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is that each row is shifted in a certain direction, and the elements that are shifted out are replaced by those from the next row. For example, row0 is shifted right by two positions, but the elements that get pushed out are replaced by elements from row1. But I need to check.\n\nAlternatively, looking at example0's output:\n\nThe first row's elements after position 1 are 5,5,5, which match the first three elements of row1 in input. Then row1's output starts with 8,8,6, which are the first three elements of row2 in input. Row2's output starts with 5,8,8, which are elements from row3's input (row3 starts with 8,8,4). So perhaps each row is taking the next row's elements starting from column0, but shifted.\n\nWait, row0's output has [2,7,5,5,5]. The first two elements are from row0's input, then the next three are row1's first three elements. Then row1's output is [8,8,6,8,4], which are row2's first three elements (8,5,5) but no. Wait row2's input is [8,5,5,5,2], so first three are 8,5,5. But output row1's first three are 8,8,6. Hmm, not matching.\n\nAnother angle: perhaps the transformation is that each element (i,j) is replaced by the element from (i+1, j-1) in the input, with wrap-around. Let's check example1.\n\nIn example1's output row0, column1 is 8. Input's row1, column2 is 8. So (0,1) \u2192 (1,2). Which is (i+1, j+1). Then output row1, column2 is 5. Input row0, column1 is 5. So (1,2) \u2192 (0,1). That's (i-1, j-1). This seems like a diagonal shift but not consistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe a clockwise rotation of elements in a certain pattern, like a ring. For example, each element is moved to the next position clockwise around the matrix. For a 3x3 matrix, the elements around the perimeter would shift. Let's see example1.\n\nInput perimeter elements (in order):3,5,1,8,9,4,2,4.\n\nIf rotated clockwise by one, the new perimeter would be4,3,5,1,8,9,4,2. Let's arrange them:\n\nRow0:3,5,1 \u2192 becomes 4,3,5?\n\nNo, the output row0 is3,8,1. Not matching. So probably not.\n\nAnother Idea: Looking at example2's output:\n\nThe middle row is [8,7,8]. The input's middle row was [5,7,5]. The 8s come from the row below's elements (8,8,2). So maybe the first and last elements of the middle row are taken from the row below's first and last elements. But in example1's middle row (row1), output is [4,8,5]. The input row2's elements are [2,4,9]. So row1's third element is 5, which was in input row0's middle. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation involves transposing the matrix and then performing some shifts, but I'm not sure.\n\nAt this point, perhaps it's best to look for a pattern in how the elements are moved between rows and columns. Let's try to see for each example.\n\nExample0's input row0: [2,7,8,8,8] \u2192 output row0: [2,7,5,5,5]. The 5s come from row1's first three elements [5,5,6]. But output row0's third element is 5, which is row1's first element. Fourth element is 5, which is row1's second element. Fifth element is 5, which is row1's third element? But row1's third element is 6. Hmm, that doesn't add up. So maybe it's 5,5,5 from row1's first three elements (5,5,6 \u2192 but third is 6, not 5. So not exactly.\n\nExample0's output row1: [8,8,6,8,4]. Input row2 is [8,5,5,5,2]. So the first two elements 8,8 come from row2's first two elements (8,5) but output is 8,8. So maybe row2's first element is 8, but the second element becomes 8. That's not from the input. Unless there's a typo. Wait, input row2 is [8,5,5,5,2], so first element is 8, second is5. So output row1's first two elements are 8,8. Where does the second 8 come from? Input row3's first element is 8. So maybe row1's second element is taken from row3's first element. So row1's elements in output are a mix of row2 and row3's elements.\n\nThis seems complicated. Maybe there's a pattern where each row after the first is shifted up by one, and the elements that overflow are placed in the previous row. For example, row1's elements are shifted up into row0's remaining positions.\n\nBut in example0, row0's output is [2,7,5,5,5]. The first two elements are from row0, the next three are from row1's elements. But row1's elements are [5,5,6,5,4]. So the next three are 5,5,6. But output row0 has 5,5,5. So that's not matching.\n\nAnother Idea: Maybe each row is shifted left by a certain number of positions, and the overflow elements are taken from the next row. For example, row0 is shifted left by 0, row1 by 1, etc. But not sure.\n\nAlternatively, think of the matrix as layers and rotate each layer. For example, in a 5x5 matrix, rotate the outermost layer, then the next layer, etc. But example0's output doesn't seem to be a rotated version.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each row is reversed and then elements are taken from the row below. For example, row0 is reversed, then elements are replaced with row1's elements. But not sure.\n\nAnother Idea: Maybe the transformation involves taking the elements of each column and rotating them. For example, column0 becomes [2,5,8,8,6] in example0's input. Output column0 is [2,8,5,5,6]. So 2 (row0), 8 (row1), 5 (row2), 5 (row3), 6 (row4). So it's shifted down by one. Let's check: input column0 is [2,5,8,8,6]. Output column0 is [2,8,5,5,6]. So input column0 shifted down by one, with row0 remaining the same. So row1's column0 is 8 (from input row2's 8), row2's column0 is 5 (from input row3's 8?), which doesn't match.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each column is shifted down by one, with the bottom element wrapping to the top. But example0's output column0 is [2,8,5,5,6]. Input column0 is [2,5,8,8,6]. Shifting down by one would make the new column0 as [6,2,5,8,8], which doesn't match the output.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the columns are being rotated in some way. For example, the first column remains the same, the second column is shifted down by one, etc. Not sure.\n\nThis is getting too time-consuming. Maybe I need to look for another pattern.\n\nAnother observation: in example1's output, the middle element (row1, column1) is 8, which wasn't in the input's middle. The 8 comes from row1's third element in input (which is 8). So perhaps the middle element of the output is taken from the third element of the same row in input, but that doesn't explain others.\n\nAlternatively, looking at example1's input and output:\n\nInput:\n\n3 5 1\n\n4 5 8\n\n2 4 9\n\nOutput:\n\n3 8 1\n\n4 8 5\n\n2 4 9\n\nThe 8s in the output are in positions (0,1) and (1,1). The input's 8 is at (1,2). So maybe the 8 in the output's (0,1) is taken from (1,2), and the 8 in (1,1) is taken from (2,0) or (0,2). But (2,0) is 2, which is not 8. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, the output's (0,1) 8 comes from input's (1,2) 8, and output's (1,1) 8 comes from input's (2,2) 9? No, that's 9.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that each element is replaced by the element that is one row below and two columns to the right (mod the number of columns). For example, in example1's (0,1), the element would come from (1, 1+2=3, but mod 3 (since there are 3 columns), that's 0. So input's (1,0) is 4. Which doesn't match output's 8.\n\nThis approach isn't working. Let's think differently. Maybe the transformation is that each row is shifted in such a way that the first elements stay the same, and the rest are filled with elements from the next row. For example, in example0's row0: after the first two elements, the next three are from row1. Then row1's first three elements are from row2, and so on.\n\nLooking at example0's output:\n\nRow0: [2,7,5,5,5] \u2192 input row0's first two, then input row1's first three.\n\nRow1: [8,8,6,8,4] \u2192 input row2's first three elements are [8,5,5], but output row1's first three are 8,8,6. Doesn't match.\n\nHmm. But output row1's first two elements are 8,8, which are from input row2's first element (8) and input row3's first element (8). So perhaps each row's elements after certain positions are taken from the next row's elements.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is that for each element in the output matrix at position (i,j), it's equal to the input matrix's element at (i+1, j-1), with wrapping. But let's check example1's output (0,1) which is 8. Input's (1,0) is 4. Not matching. So no.\n\nAnother Idea: Let's see if the output matrix is formed by taking the elements from the input matrix in a certain order. For example, in example0's output:\n\nRow0: 2,7,5,5,5 \u2192 input row0:2,7,8,8,8; input row1:5,5,6,5,4. So the first two are from row0, then three from row1.\n\nRow1:8,8,6,8,4 \u2192 input row2:8,5,5,5,2; input row3:8,8,4,3,6. So first two from row2, then row3's elements? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, for each row in the output, the elements are a combination of the same row and the row below. For example, output row0 takes the first two elements from row0, and the remaining elements from row1. But the length varies. For example0, row0 in output has first two from row0, then three from row1. But row1 in input has five elements. So three elements from row1's first three. But in example0's row0 output, the third to fifth elements are 5,5,5. Input row1's first three are 5,5,6. So the third element is 5, fifth is 5, which would be the first three elements of row1 (5,5,6) but taking the first three as 5,5,5? No, that doesn't fit.\n\nMaybe there's a pattern where each row after the first is shifted up, and the last row is formed from the first row's elements. But example0's last row in output is [6,8,1,9,3], which matches the input's last row except for the second element (5 becomes 8). So perhaps the last row is modified using elements from the row above.\n\nAnother Idea: Looking at all examples, perhaps the transformation is that for each cell (i,j), the output cell is the input cell (i+1, j), except for the last row which is input cell (i, j). But how to handle the last row.\n\nFor example, in example1's output:\n\nRow0: input row1's elements. Let's see:\n\nInput row1 is [4,5,8]. Output row0 is [3,8,1]. So that doesn't fit.\n\nBut wait, output row0's elements are from input row0 and row1. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, each row except the last is replaced by the row below it. So row0 becomes row1, row1 becomes row2, etc. But example0's output row0 is not the same as input row1. So that's not it.\n\nAt this point, I'm stuck. Maybe I should look for a different approach. Let's consider that the transformation involves swapping elements around the center. For example, in example2's output, the middle element (7) remains the same, but the surrounding elements are swapped. The output row0 middle is 8 (from row2's first element?), row1's first and last elements are 8 and 8 (from row2's elements).\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is to rotate the elements around the center in some way. For example, each element at (i,j) is replaced by the element (n-j-1, i) as in a rotation. But example0's output doesn't seem like a rotation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's a combination of shifting rows and columns. For example, shifting columns to the right and rows down. But not sure.\n\nAnother Idea: Let's look for the positions of the numbers in the input and output matrices. For example, in example0's input, the number 5 appears in various places. In the output, those 5s are arranged in different positions. Maybe there's a pattern where certain numbers are moved to specific locations.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is to take the elements in a spiral order from the input and place them in a different spiral order in the output. But this seems complex.\n\nAnother Idea: Maybe the transformation involves taking the elements from the input matrix and arranging them in a certain order, such as reading them column-wise and then writing them row-wise with a shift. But let's see.\n\nFor example0's input:\n\nColumns:\n\nColumn0:2,5,8,8,6\n\nColumn1:7,5,5,8,5\n\nColumn2:8,6,5,4,1\n\nColumn3:8,5,5,3,9\n\nColumn4:8,4,2,6,3\n\nIf the output is generated by taking these columns and arranging them in a different order. But example0's output rows are:\n\n[2,7,5,5,5]\n\n[8,8,6,8,4]\n\n[5,8,8,8,2]\n\n[5,5,4,3,6]\n\n[6,8,1,9,3]\n\nLooking at the output's column0:\n\n2,8,5,5,6 \u2192 which is different from the input's column0.\n\nThis approach isn't helping.\n\nPerhaps the answer lies in the movement of specific elements from their original positions. For example, in example0, the 8s in the first row are replaced with 5s from the row below. In example1, the 5 in the first row is replaced with an 8 from the row below. In example2, the 5 in the first row is replaced with an 8 from the row below. So maybe the pattern is that in each row except the last, certain elements (like the third and onwards) are replaced with elements from the row below.\n\nBut how exactly? For example0's first row, the third, fourth, and fifth elements are replaced with the first three elements of row1. Then, row1's first three elements are replaced with row2's first three elements. This pattern continues until the last row.\n\nSo, in general, for each row i (except the last), the elements from position 2 onwards are replaced with the elements from row i+1's first few elements. Let's check:\n\nExample0's row0 (input) has elements [2,7,8,8,8]. Output row0 is [2,7,5,5,5]. The replaced elements (5,5,5) are the first three elements of row1 (input row1: [5,5,6,5,4] \u2192 first three are 5,5,6). Wait, but output row0's replaced elements are 5,5,5. So the third element is 5 (from row1's first), fourth is 5 (row1's second), fifth is 5 (row1's third element is 6, but output is 5). That doesn't align.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the number of elements replaced depends on the row's position. For example, in row0, replace the last three elements with the first three of row1. But in example0's row0, last three elements are replaced with 5,5,5 which are the first three of row1 (5,5,6). So third element would be 5 (correct), fourth 5 (correct), fifth 6 (but output is 5). So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the replacement is done in a way that the elements after the second position are replaced with the elements from the row below, but shifted left by one. For example0's row0's third element is taken from row1's first, fourth from row1's second, fifth from row1's third. But row1's third element is 6, so fifth element should be 6, but output is 5. So that doesn't fit.\n\nThis is really challenging. Let's try to see if there's a different approach. For each example, the output seems to have elements that are rearranged in a way that each row i is a combination of elements from row i and row i+1. But the pattern isn't clear.\n\nLooking at example2's input:\n\nRow0:6,5,3 \u2192 output row0:6,8,3\n\nRow1:5,7,5 \u2192 output row1:8,7,8\n\nRow2:8,8,2 \u2192 output row2:5,5,2\n\nSo, the 8s in the output are coming from row2's elements. For example, output row0's middle is 8 (from row2's first element 8), output row1's first and third elements are 8 (from row2's first and second elements). Output row2's first two elements are 5,5 (from row1's first and second elements, which are 5 and7). Wait, row1's elements are 5,7,5. So output row2's first two are 5,5. Hmm, that doesn't make sense.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the elements from row2 are moving up to row0 and row1, while row1's elements move down to row2.\n\nIn example2's output:\n\nRow0:6 (from row0), 8 (row2's first), 3 (row0's third)\n\nRow1:8 (row2's first), 7 (row1's middle), 8 (row2's second)\n\nRow2:5 (row1's first),5 (row1's third),2 (row2's third)\n\nSo maybe each element (i,j) is:\n\n- For i < last row:\n\nIf j == middle, take from row i+1's first element.\n\nElse if j < middle, take from row i+1's j+1.\n\nNot sure. This is getting too specific.\n\nAlternatively, in example2's output, the first and third elements of row0 and row1 are replaced with elements from row2. Maybe the pattern is that for each row except the last, the elements at positions 1 and 3 are replaced with elements from the row below. But this is just a guess.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and the lack of a clear pattern, I'll have to make an educated guess. Based on the examples, it seems like each row (except the last) is taking elements from the row below, possibly shifted. For example, in example1's output, row0's middle is taken from row1's last element. Example0's row0 takes elements from row1's first few elements. Example2's row0 and row1 take elements from row2.\n\nPutting this together, the pattern might be that for each row i (starting from 0), the elements from column j = i+1 onwards are replaced with elements from the row i+1's columns starting from j=0. So for example, row0 starts at j=1 and takes elements from row1's columns starting from j=0. But this is a guess.\n\nApplying this to the test input:\n\nTest input is a 4x4 matrix:\n\n[8,8,4,5]\n\n[3,8,7,5]\n\n[3,7,1,9]\n\n[6,4,8,8]\n\nFollowing the pattern from the examples, perhaps each row (except the last) is taking elements from the row below, starting at a certain column.\n\nFor example, row0 would take elements from row1 starting at column0. Let's see:\n\nOriginal row0: [8,8,4,5]\n\nIf we replace elements after position 0 with row1's elements starting from column0:\n\nSo row0's output would be [8,3,8,7] \u2192 but this doesn't match the examples. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, for each row i, replace elements starting from column i with elements from row i+1 starting from column 0. For example, in example1 (3x3):\n\nRow0: replace from column0, take row1's elements. So output row0: [3,8,1] which takes row0's first element, then row1's third and first elements? Not sure.\n\nThis is not leading me to a solution. Given the time I've spent, I'll try to construct the test output based on the examples.\n\nLooking at the test input:\n\nRows:\n\n0:8,8,4,5\n\n1:3,8,7,5\n\n2:3,7,1,9\n\n3:6,4,8,8\n\nAssuming the pattern is that each row takes elements from the row below. For example, row0's elements after certain positions are replaced by elements from row1. Let's try to see:\n\nIf the first two elements of row0 are kept, then the next two are taken from row1's first two elements:\n\nSo row0 becomes [8,8,3,8]. But looking at example0's row0 kept first two, then took row1's first three elements. Since the test input has four elements per row, maybe row0 takes the first two elements from itself and the next two from row1's first two. So [8,8,3,8].\n\nBut let's check example1's row0: kept first element (3), then took row1's third element (8) and row0's third (1). So maybe it's different.\n\nAlternatively, for each row i, the elements after position i are taken from row i+1's elements starting from position 0. For example, in example0 (5 rows):\n\nRow0: i=0, elements after 0 are taken from row1's elements starting from 0. So row0's output is [2,7,5,5,6] \u2192 but actual output is [2,7,5,5,5]. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe for each row i, the elements after position i are replaced with row i+1's elements up to the end. For example, row0: elements after 0 (positions 1-4) are replaced with row1's elements 0-3. But example0's row0 output is [2,7,5,5,5], which would suggest row1's elements 0-2 are used. So this is inconsistent.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and the lack of a clear pattern, I'll have to make a guess. Looking at the examples, the output for the test input might be:\n\nRow0: [8,8,3,8]\n\nRow1: [3,8,3,7]\n\nRow2: [6,4,6,4]\n\nRow3: [6,4,8,8]\n\nBut this is a random guess. Alternatively, based on example0 and example2, where the last row remains mostly the same except for some elements, perhaps the test output's last row is [6,4,8,8] (same as input), and the other rows are modified by taking elements from the row below.\n\nAnother possible pattern: each row is shifted up by one, and the last row is filled with elements from the first row. But example0's output doesn't fit that.\n\nAlternatively, the pattern might be that each row i is replaced by row (i+1) for i < n-1, and the last row is the original first row. But example0's output's last row is [6,8,1,9,3], which is almost the same as the input's last row except for the second element. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAt this point, I'm really stuck. Given that this is a puzzle, maybe the pattern is that each element (i,j) in the output is the element from (i-1, j+1) of the input, with wrap-around. Let's test this on example1.\n\nExample1's output (0,1) is 8. Input's (i-1, j+1) would be ( -1, 2), which wraps around to (2, 2) (since rows are 3). Input's row2, column2 is9. So that doesn't fit. Not helpful.\n\nGiven that I'm unable to find a clear pattern, I'll have to make an educated guess based on the examples. Looking at the test input:\n\nTest Input:\n\n[8,8,4,5]\n\n[3,8,7,5]\n\n[3,7,1,9]\n\n[6,4,8,8]\n\nAssuming the pattern is that each row (except the last) takes elements from the row below, starting from the third element. For example, row0 takes elements from row1's first two elements. So output row0 would be [8,8,3,8]. Row1 would take elements from row2's first two elements: [3,8,3,7]. Row2 takes elements from row3's first two: [3,7,6,4]. Row3 remains [6,4,8,8]. But I'm not confident. \n\nAlternatively, based on example1 and example2, the middle elements are being replaced with elements from the row below. For the test input, which is 4x4, perhaps the middle elements (columns 1 and 2) are replaced with elements from the row below. For row0, columns 1 and 2 are replaced with row1's columns 2 and 3. So row0 would become [8,7,5,5]. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is to shift each row to the right by one position, with the element from the next row's first position. For example, row0's last element becomes row1's first element. Let's see:\n\nTest input row0: [8,8,4,5]. Shifted right by one would be [5,8,8,4], then replace the first element with row1's first element (3). So [3,8,8,4]. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the pattern is that each element is replaced by the element below and to the right. For example, (i,j) becomes (i+1, j+1), with wrap-around. For the test input's row0, column0:8. Output row0, column0 would be row1's column1 (8). So row0 becomes [8,7,1,8]. But not sure.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and the lack of progress, I'll have to make a guess. Based on the examples, the output for the test input might be:\n\n[8,8,3,8]\n\n[3,7,6,4]\n\n[3,7,6,4]\n\n[6,4,8,8]\n\nBut this is just a wild guess. Alternatively, following example0's pattern where the first two elements of row0 are kept, then the next elements are from row1's first elements. So row0 would be [8,8,3,8], row1: [3,8,3,7], row2: [3,7,6,4], row3: [6,4,8,8]. \n\nBut without a clear pattern, this is difficult. The correct answer is likely:\n\n[8,8,3,8]\n\n[3,7,6,4]\n\n[3,7,6,4]\n\n[6,4,8,8]\n\nBut I'm not sure. Alternatively, another possible output based on example1 and example2:\n\nTest Output:\n\n[8,8,3,8]\n\n[3,8,7,5]\n\n[6,4,8,8]\n\n[3,7,1,9]\n\nBut again, unsure. Given the time I've spent, I'll proceed with this.",

        "cot_2": "Okay, let's tackle this puzzle. So, the task is to figure out the pattern that transforms the input lists into the output lists in the training examples, then apply that pattern to the test input. Let's start by looking closely at each example to spot the pattern.\n\nStarting with Example 0:\n\nInput:\n[2, 7, 8, 8, 8]\n[5, 5, 6, 5, 4]\n[8, 5, 5, 5, 2]\n[8, 8, 4, 3, 6]\n[6, 5, 1, 9, 3]\n\nOutput:\n[2, 7, 5, 5, 5]\n[8, 8, 6, 8, 4]\n[5, 8, 8, 8, 2]\n[5, 5, 4, 3, 6]\n[6, 8, 1, 9, 3]\n\nHmm. Let's compare each row. The first input row is [2,7,8,8,8], output is [2,7,5,5,5]. Wait, the first two elements are the same, then the next three are 5s. Looking at the next input rows. The second input row starts with 5,5,6,5,4. The output for the second row is [8,8,6,8,4]. The first two elements are 8,8. So maybe some rotation or swapping between rows?\n\nWait, perhaps each row is shifted, but where do the numbers come from? Let me check vertically. For example, the third element of the first output row is 5. Looking at the input's third column: in the first input row, third element is 8, second row third is 6, third row third is 5, fourth row third is 4, fifth row third is 1. But the output first row third element is 5. Maybe that's from the third row's third element. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each row is rotated in a certain way. Let's look at the first input row's third to fifth elements: 8,8,8. The output replaces those with 5,5,5. Where do those 5s come from? Looking at the second input row, those are 5,5,6,5,4. The third element of that row is 6. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a shift upwards. Let's consider that each element in the output is taken from the row below. For example, in the first output row [2,7,5,5,5], the 5s might come from the row below's first elements. The third element of the first output row is 5. The third element of the second input row is 6. Wait, that doesn't fit. Maybe it's a diagonal shift.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the elements are being rotated in a circular way. For example, the first row's last three elements (8,8,8) become 5,5,5. Looking at the second input row's first three elements (5,5,6). Wait, the third element there is 6. Not matching. Hmm.\n\nWait, looking at Example 1:\n\nInput:\n[3,5,1]\n[4,5,8]\n[2,4,9]\n\nOutput:\n[3,8,1]\n[4,8,5]\n[2,4,9]\n\nHere, the output's first row is [3,8,1]. The input's first row is [3,5,1], so the middle element changed from 5 to 8. The output's second row is [4,8,5]. The input's second row is [4,5,8]. So the middle element is 8, and the third element is 5, which was the original middle element. The third row remains the same. Interesting. So maybe in each 3x3 grid, the middle elements are being rotated. Let's check:\n\nIn Example 1, the center is 5 (from input row 2, column 2). The output's first row middle is 8 (from input row 2, column 3?), and the second row's middle is 8, perhaps from input row 3? Wait, but the third row didn't change. Alternatively, maybe it's a clockwise rotation of the middle elements. Let's see:\n\nOriginal positions around the center (assuming it's a 3x3 grid):\n\nPositions (row, column):\n\n(0,0) (0,1) (0,2)\n(1,0) (1,1) (1,2)\n(2,0) (2,1) (2,2)\n\nThe center is (1,1). The elements around it are (0,1), (1,2), (2,1), (1,0). If we rotate these elements clockwise, perhaps. Let's see:\n\nIn Example 1's input:\n\nThe elements around the center (5 at 1,1) are:\n\nTop: (0,1) =5\n\nRight: (1,2)=8\n\nBottom: (2,1)=4\n\nLeft: (1,0)=4\n\nIf we rotate them clockwise, the top (5) would move to right, right (8) to bottom, bottom (4) to left, left (4) to top.\n\nBut in the output, the top (0,1) becomes 8, right (1,2) becomes 5, bottom (2,1) remains 4, left (1,0) becomes 4. Wait, that's not matching. Let's check the output:\n\nOutput first row is [3,8,1]. So (0,1) is 8 (previously 5). The second row is [4,8,5]. (1,2) is 5 (previously 8). The third row is same. So perhaps the elements around the center (the four adjacent) are rotated. Let me see:\n\nOriginal positions (adjacent):\n\nTop: 5 (0,1)\n\nRight:8 (1,2)\n\nBottom:4 (2,1)\n\nLeft:4 (1,0)\n\nIf rotated clockwise, the top becomes right, right becomes bottom, bottom becomes left, left becomes top. So:\n\nNew top (0,1) would take the value from left (4). But in the output, (0,1) is 8. Hmm, that's not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the elements in the cross (the row and column of the center) are shifted. Let's see in Example 1:\n\nOriginal center is 5 (1,1). The cross includes all elements in row 1 and column 1.\n\nRow 1: [4,5,8]\n\nColumn 1: [5,5,4] (from rows 0,1,2).\n\nBut how does this become the output? The output's row 0, column 1 is 8. Row 1, column 1 is 8. Hmm. Wait, maybe the center element is replaced by the maximum in the cross? The original center is 5. The cross elements are 4,5,8 (row 1) and 5,5,4 (column 1). The maximum is 8. So the new center is 8. But in the output, row 1, column 1 is 8. Then, in row 0, column 1 becomes 8. But why?\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a shift of the cross elements. Let's think:\n\nIn Example 1's input:\n\nRow 1 (cross row) is [4,5,8]. Column 1 (cross column) is [5,5,4].\n\nIn output, row 0, column 1 is 8 (from original row 1, column 2?), and row 1, column 1 is 8. Maybe the cross row is shifted right, and cross column shifted down. Let's see:\n\nIf row 1 is shifted right: [4,5,8] shifted right would become [8,4,5]. But output row 1 is [4,8,5]. So the 8 is in the middle. Maybe shifted so that the center becomes the next element. Alternatively, maybe the cross row and column are rotated.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the entire cross (row and column) is rotated clockwise. For example, the cross row elements (4,5,8) and cross column elements (5,5,4) form a plus sign. Rotating them 90 degrees. But that's a bit abstract.\n\nAlternatively, looking at Example 2:\n\nInput:\n[6,5,3]\n[5,7,5]\n[8,8,2]\n\nOutput:\n[6,8,3]\n[8,7,8]\n[5,5,2]\n\nHere, the output first row has 8 in the middle. Original input's middle is 7. So perhaps the center is 7, and surrounding elements are rotated. The output's first row middle is 8, which was from the third row's first element (8). The second row becomes [8,7,8]. The original second row was [5,7,5]. So the first element became 8 (from input's third row first element?), and the third element became 8 (from input's first row third element 3? But that doesn't make sense. Wait, the output's second row is [8,7,8]. So the first element is 8, which in the input's third row first element is 8. The third element is 8, which in the input's first row third element is 3. Hmm, that's not matching.\n\nAlternatively, let's think about the four elements surrounding the center. For a 3x3 grid, the four adjacent elements (top, right, bottom, left). For example 2, center is 7 (row 1, column 1). Adjacent elements are:\n\nTop:5 (row 0, column 1)\n\nRight:5 (row 1, column 2)\n\nBottom:8 (row 2, column 1)\n\nLeft:5 (row 1, column 0)\n\nIn the output, the top becomes 8 (from where?), the right becomes 8 (from original input?), left becomes 8? Let's see. Output row 0: [6,8,3], so top adjacent is 8. Output row 1: [8,7,8]. So left adjacent is 8, right adjacent is 8. Bottom adjacent in output row 2 is 5 (row 2, column 1 is 5). Original input's bottom adjacent was 8. So perhaps the four adjacent elements are rotated. Let's see:\n\nOriginal elements around center: 5 (top),5 (right),8 (bottom),5 (left).\n\nIf rotated clockwise, the top (5) moves to right, right (5) to bottom, bottom (8) to left, left (5) to top. Then the new elements would be:\n\nTop:5 (from left)\n\nRight:5 (from top)\n\nBottom:5 (from right)\n\nLeft:8 (from bottom)\n\nBut the output for Example 2's adjacent elements are:\n\nTop:8, right:8, bottom:5, left:8.\n\nHmm, that doesn't fit. So maybe the adjacent elements are replaced by the maximum or some other function.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the outputs of the examples, perhaps the transformation involves rotating the matrix's layers. For example, in a matrix, each layer (outer ring, then inner rings) is rotated. Let's check Example 0:\n\nOriginal input is a 5x5 matrix. The output's first row is [2,7,5,5,5]. The first two elements are same as input. The third, fourth, fifth elements changed. The second row in output starts with 8,8. Maybe the outer ring is rotated. For example, the outer elements (first and last rows and columns) are rotated in some way.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the matrix is split into concentric squares, and each square is rotated clockwise. For a 5x5 matrix, the outermost layer would be the first and fifth rows and columns. Then the next layer would be the second and fourth, etc. Let's see in Example 0:\n\nInput's first row: [2,7,8,8,8]\n\nOutput's first row: [2,7,5,5,5]. The first two elements same. The next three changed. The second row of input: [5,5,6,5,4]. Output second row: [8,8,6,8,4]. The first two elements are 8,8. Where could those 8s come from? The input's third row first element is 8. So maybe in rotating the outer layer, the elements are shifted. For example, rotating the outer layer to the right by one step. Let me imagine:\n\nOriginal outer layer (5x5 matrix):\n\nRow 0: [2,7,8,8,8]\n\nRow 1: 5 (start), ... ,4 (end)\n\nRow 2:8 ... 2\n\nRow 3:8 ...6\n\nRow4:6,5,1,9,3\n\nThe outer layer includes all elements of the first and last rows, and the first and last elements of the middle rows.\n\nIf we rotate the outer layer clockwise by one position, each element shifts to the right, except the corners. Let's see:\n\nFor example, the top row [2,7,8,8,8] would shift to the right. The last element (8) would move to the start of the next row. Similarly, the elements of the rightmost column (8,4,2,6,3) would shift down. The last row [6,5,1,9,3] would shift left. The leftmost column (2,5,8,8,6) would shift up.\n\nBut this might get complicated. Let's see if that makes sense for Example 0.\n\nOriginal outer layer elements:\n\nTop row: 2,7,8,8,8\n\nRight column:8,4,2,6,3 (from rows 0 to 4, column 4)\n\nBottom row (reversed):3,9,1,5,6 (since we go from right to left when moving up from the bottom)\n\nLeft column (reversed):6,8,8,5,2 (from row4 to row0, column0)\n\nIf we rotate these elements clockwise once, each element moves to the next position. So the new top row would be the left column reversed (except the last element) plus the original top row's first element. Wait, maybe this is getting too complicated.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each layer is rotated. For a 5x5 matrix, the outermost layer is rotated, and the inner layers are left as is. Let's see the output for Example 0's outer layer.\n\nOriginal outer layer:\n\nTop row: 2,7,8,8,8\n\nRight column:8,4,2,6,3\n\nBottom row (reverse):3,9,1,5,6\n\nLeft column (reverse):6,8,8,5,2\n\nAfter rotation, the new top row should be the left column (reversed). Left column reversed is [6,8,8,5,2]. Wait, but the output's first row is [2,7,5,5,5]. That doesn't match. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the layers are rotated in a way that shifts elements. For instance, moving the left column to the top row, but not the entire column. Alternatively, perhaps only certain elements are rotated.\n\nLooking back at Example 1, which is a 3x3 matrix. The output's first row middle element is 8, which was in the original third row, third column. So maybe the rotation involves elements from different rows and columns.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern involves swapping elements in a specific way. For instance, swapping the middle element of each edge in a clockwise manner. For Example 1's 3x3 grid:\n\nOriginal edges:\n\nTop edge (excluding corners): [5]\n\nRight edge: [8]\n\nBottom edge: [4]\n\nLeft edge: [4]\n\nSwapping them clockwise: top \u2192 right \u2192 bottom \u2192 left \u2192 top.\n\nSo top's middle (5) moves to right's middle, right's middle (8) moves to bottom's middle (4) becomes new left's middle, etc. But in Example 1's output, the top middle is 8, which was the right's middle. The right's middle becomes 5 (from original top?), and the bottom's middle is 4 (original left's 4?), left's middle becomes 4 (original bottom's 4). So that seems to fit. Let's check:\n\nOriginal:\nTop middle:5\nRight middle:8\nBottom middle:4 (row 2, column 1)\nLeft middle:4 (row1, column0)\n\nAfter clockwise rotation:\nTop middle becomes left middle (4)\nLeft middle becomes bottom middle (4)\nBottom middle becomes right middle (4)\nRight middle becomes top middle (8)\n\nBut that doesn't match the output. Because in the output, the top middle is 8 (right's original), right's middle is 5 (original top?), etc. So perhaps the direction is different. Let me try a different approach.\n\nIn Example 1's output:\n\nThe first row is [3,8,1]. The original first row was [3,5,1]. The middle element 5 is replaced by 8. The second row is [4,8,5]. Original second row was [4,5,8]. The middle becomes 8, and the third element becomes 5. The third row remains [2,4,9].\n\nSo the 8 in the top middle comes from the original third element of the second row (8). The 5 in the third position of the second row comes from the original middle (5). So perhaps there's a rotation of elements around the center. Like, the elements in the cross (the center's row and column) are rotated.\n\nFor Example 1, the center row (row1) is [4,5,8] and center column (column1) is [5,5,4]. The output's row0, column1 is 8 (original row1, column2), row1, column1 is 8 (from where?), row1, column2 is 5 (original row0, column1's 5). So perhaps the cross elements are rotated. For example, the center column is shifted up, and the center row is shifted right, but with the center overlapping.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the cross elements (row1 and column1) are rotated in a circular manner. For Example1's input:\n\nCenter row (row1): [4,5,8]\nCenter column (column1): [5 (row0),5 (row1),4 (row2)]\n\nCombined cross elements: row1's elements and column1's elements (excluding the center to avoid duplicates). Wait, that's row1 (4,5,8) and column1 (5,5,4). So the cross consists of all elements in row1 and column1.\n\nNow, in the output, row0 column1 is 8 (from row1 column2?), row1 column0 is 4, row1 column2 is 5 (from row0 column1?), row2 column1 is 4. Hmm, maybe the cross elements are rotated clockwise. Let's see:\n\nOriginal cross elements:\n\nRow1: [4,5,8]\nColumn1: [5,5,4]\n\nThe cross would form a plus shape. If we rotate these elements clockwise:\n\nThe elements in the top of the column (5) move to the right end of the row. The right end of the row (8) moves to the bottom of the column. The bottom of the column (4) moves to the left end of the row. The left end of the row (4) moves to the top of the column.\n\nSo:\n\nNew row1: [4,5,5] (since left end was 4, which moves to top of column. Then the original row1 elements would shift?)\n\nWait, perhaps this is getting too complicated. Let's try to track each position.\n\nOriginal cross elements:\n\nRow1 (positions (1,0), (1,1), (1,2)): 4,5,8\n\nColumn1 (positions (0,1), (1,1), (2,1)):5,5,4\n\nAfter rotation, maybe each element moves to the next position in a clockwise direction.\n\nFor example:\n\n- The top of the column (0,1) 5 \u2192 moves to the right end of the row (1,2) becomes 5.\n\n- The right end of the row (1,2) 8 \u2192 moves to the bottom of the column (2,1) becomes 8.\n\n- The bottom of the column (2,1) 4 \u2192 moves to the left end of the row (1,0) becomes 4.\n\n- The left end of the row (1,0) 4 \u2192 moves to the top of the column (0,1) becomes 4.\n\nBut in the output, (0,1) is 8, (1,2) is5, (2,1) is4, (1,0) is4. So this doesn't fit. But in the output:\n\n(0,1) becomes 8. So maybe the rotation is different. Wait, perhaps the cross elements are rotated in a way that the row is shifted right and the column shifted down, with the center element staying the same.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the numbers, maybe each element in the cross is replaced by the next element in a certain order. For Example 1's cross:\n\nOriginal elements:\n\nRow1:4,5,8 \u2192 becomes 4,8,5 in output.\n\nColumn1:5,5,4 \u2192 becomes8,8,4 in output.\n\nWait, in output:\n\nRow1: [4,8,5]. Column1 becomes:\n\nrow0:8, row1:8, row2:4.\n\nSo, perhaps the row elements are shifted right, and the column elements are shifted down. So for row1:4,5,8 shifted right \u2192 8,4,5. But output is 4,8,5. Not matching. For column, shifting down would take 5 (row0) to row1, 5 (row1) to row2, and 4 (row2) to row0. But in output, column1 is 8,8,4. That doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the cross elements are being replaced with elements from other positions. For example, in Example1, the output row0, column1 is 8, which comes from row1, column2. The output row1, column2 is 5, which comes from row0, column1. The output row2, column1 is4 (same as original). The output row1, column0 is4 (same as original). So swapping row0, column1 with row1, column2, and row1, column1 becomes 8. But where does the 8 come from? It might be the original row1, column2's 8.\n\nWait, in Example1's output:\n\nrow0: [3,8,1] \u2192 middle element 8 (was 5)\nrow1: [4,8,5] \u2192 middle 8 (was5), third element5 (was8)\nrow2: same.\n\nSo the middle of the entire matrix (row1, column1) becomes 8, which was the third element of row1 (original row1, column2). The third element of row1 becomes5 (original row0, column1's 5). And row0, column1 becomes8 (original row1, column2's 8). So it looks like a swap between row0, column1 and row1, column2, and row1, column1 takes the value from row1, column2.\n\nBut why? What's the pattern here. Let's check Example2.\n\nExample2 input:\n[6,5,3]\n[5,7,5]\n[8,8,2]\n\nOutput:\n[6,8,3]\n[8,7,8]\n[5,5,2]\n\nIn the output:\n\nrow0, column1 is8 (original row1, column0's5? Or row2, column0's8?)\n\nrow1, column0 is8 (original row2, column0's8)\n\nrow1, column2 is8 (original row0, column2's3? Not matching. Or perhaps row2, column1's8)\n\nrow2, column0 is5 (original row1, column0's5)\n\nHmm. This seems like the elements around the center are rotated in a counter-clockwise or clockwise manner. Let's think of the four corners around the center.\n\nIn a 3x3 grid, the four adjacent elements are top, right, bottom, left of the center. For Example2:\n\nOriginal adjacents:\n\ntop:5 (row0, column1)\n\nright:5 (row1, column2)\n\nbottom:8 (row2, column1)\n\nleft:5 (row1, column0)\n\nIn the output:\n\ntop becomes8 (from left's 5? Not sure.)\n\nright becomes8 (from bottom's8?)\n\nleft becomes8 (from top's5?)\n\nThis is confusing. Let's think of the four adjacent elements as forming a ring around the center. If we rotate them clockwise, each element moves to the next position.\n\nOriginal order (clockwise starting from top):5 (top),5 (right),8 (bottom),5 (left).\n\nAfter rotating clockwise, they would become left's original value, then top's, etc. Wait, no. A clockwise rotation would make each element move to the next position. So top \u2192 right \u2192 bottom \u2192 left \u2192 top.\n\nSo after rotation:\n\ntop becomes left's original value (5)\n\nright becomes top's original value (5)\n\nbottom becomes right's original value (5)\n\nleft becomes bottom's original value (8)\n\nSo then, the output adjacents would be:\n\ntop:5 \u2192 becomes 5 (from left)\n\nright:5 \u2192 becomes5 (from top)\n\nbottom:8 \u2192 becomes5 (from right)\n\nleft:5 \u2192 becomes8 (from bottom)\n\nBut in the output for Example2, the adjacents are:\n\ntop:8, right:8, bottom:5, left:8.\n\nSo this doesn't fit. Alternatively, perhaps they are rotated counter-clockwise. Then top would take right's value, right takes bottom's, etc. So:\n\ntop \u2192 right's original (5)\n\nright \u2192 bottom's original (8)\n\nbottom \u2192 left's original (5)\n\nleft \u2192 top's original (5)\n\nBut the output adjacents are:\n\ntop:8, right:8, bottom:5, left:8.\n\nStill not matching. Hmm.\n\nAlternative approach: Looking for a pattern in all examples.\n\nIn Example0, the output seems to have some elements from different rows. For instance, the third element of the first output row is5. Looking at the third column in the input, the elements are:\n\nInput column3 for rows 0-4: 8,5,5,3,9.\n\nOutput's first row has 5 in column3. Perhaps it's the element from the row below? Row1, column3 is5. Row0, column3 in output is5, which is from row1, column3.\n\nSimilarly, in Example1's output, the middle of the first row is8, which comes from the third element of the second row in the input. So perhaps elements are being taken from the row below and shifted upwards.\n\nFor example, in Example1:\n\nInput row1 is [4,5,8]. The third element is8. Output row0, column1 is8. So maybe each row's elements are shifted upward from the row below.\n\nBut how does this work for other positions?\n\nIn Example0's first output row: [2,7,5,5,5]. The first two elements are from input row0. The next three could be from input row1's first three elements:5,5,6. But output has 5,5,5. Not exactly matching.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each row after the first is shifted to the left or right, and their elements are used to replace certain elements in the previous row.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern involves swapping pairs of elements between adjacent rows in a certain way.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the test input:\n\nTest input is a 4x4 matrix:\n\n[8,8,4,5]\n[3,8,7,5]\n[3,7,1,9]\n[6,4,8,8]\n\nSo what's the expected output? Following the pattern from training examples. Let's think if we can find a common rule.\n\nLooking at the training examples:\n\n- Example0 is 5x5, output involves changing certain elements from rows below or around.\n\n- Example1 and 2 are 3x3. Output involves changing the middle elements and the surrounding ones.\n\nPerhaps the pattern is that for each cell (i,j), the new value is the value from (i+1, j-1) of the original matrix, wrapping around if necessary. Or some other diagonal shift.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's a matter of shifting the elements in a spiral or some other pattern.\n\nWait, let's consider Example1's transformation again:\n\nInput rows:\n3 5 1\n4 5 8\n2 4 9\n\nOutput rows:\n3 8 1\n4 8 5\n2 4 9\n\nThe changes are:\n\nRow0: 5 \u21928 (column1)\nRow1:5 \u21928 (column1), 8\u21925 (column2)\nRow2: no change.\n\nSo, the middle element (5) becomes 8. The element at (0,1) becomes8, which was from (1,2). The element at (1,2) becomes5, which was from (0,1). The element at (1,1) becomes8. So it's like a swap between (0,1) and (1,2), and the center becomes8. But where does the 8 come from? The (1,2) was8, so swapping (0,1) and (1,2) would make row0, column1=8 and row1, column2=5. Then the center (1,1) also becomes8, which was originally5. So maybe the center is replaced by the maximum of the cross elements or something.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is that each element (i,j) is replaced by the element (j, i) from the original matrix. But that would be transposing, which doesn't fit the examples.\n\nAlternatively, let's look for a pattern in terms of even and odd rows or columns. For example, in Example0's output:\n\nFirst row's first two elements remain the same. The rest are replaced with5's. The second row starts with8,8. Maybe the elements from the row below are moved up. For example, the third element of the first row in output is5, which is the third element of the second row in input (6). No. So that's not matching.\n\nAlternatively, considering that in Example0, the first two elements of the first output row are the same, but the next three are from the row below's first three elements. The input's second row is [5,5,6,5,4], and the output's first row's last three elements are5,5,5. So not matching. But 5,5,5 could be the first three elements of the input's third row (8,5,5,5,2). No.\n\nThis is getting frustrating. Let me think differently. Let's compare the input and output matrices for each example and see if there's a common operation.\n\nExample0:\n\nInput:\n\nRow0:2 7 8 8 8 \u2192 output:2 7 5 5 5\n\nRow1:5 5 6 5 4 \u2192 output:8 8 6 8 4\n\nRow2:8 5 5 5 2 \u2192 output:5 8 8 8 2\n\nRow3:8 8 4 3 6 \u2192 output:5 5 4 3 6\n\nRow4:6 5 1 9 3 \u2192 output:6 8 1 9 3\n\nNoticing that in output row0, elements 2,7 are same as input. The next three elements are 5,5,5. In input row1, elements 5,5,6 are there, but output row0's elements are 5,5,5. Not sure.\n\nIn output row1:8,8,6,8,4. Input row0's third element is8, row1's first two are5,5. Not matching.\n\nExample1's output has row0, column1=8 (input's row1, column2=8). Row1, column2=5 (input's row0, column1=5). So swapping (0,1) and (1,2). Then the center (1,1) becomes8. But where does that 8 come from?\n\nExample2's input:\n\nRow0:6 5 3 \u2192 output:6 8 3\n\nRow1:5 7 5 \u2192 output:8 7 8\n\nRow2:8 8 2 \u2192 output:5 5 2\n\nIn this case, row0, column1 becomes8 (from row1, column0's5? No. Or row2, column0's8). So row0, column1 is8 (from row2, column0). Row1, column0 becomes8 (from row2, column0's8), and row1, column2 becomes8 (from row0, column2's3? No. Or row2, column1's8). Row2, column0 becomes5 (from row1, column0's5), row2, column1 becomes5 (from row1, column1's7? No. Or row0, column1's5).\n\nThis seems like elements are being taken from a certain diagonal or shifted position.\n\nPutting all this together, perhaps the pattern is that each element (i,j) is replaced by the element from (i+1, j-1) of the input matrix, wrapping around if necessary. Let's test this hypothesis.\n\nFor Example1's (0,1):\n\ni=0, j=1. So i+1=1, j-1=0. So element (1,0)=4. But the output (0,1) is8. Doesn't fit.\n\nAnother possibility: each element (i,j) is replaced by the element from (j, i) of the input matrix. For Example1's (0,1), which would be (1,0)=4. Not matching output's 8.\n\nAlternatively, for each element (i,j) in the output, it's the element (i+1,j) from the input, except for the last row, which takes from the first row. For Example1's (0,1), input (1,1) is5. Output is8. Doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's a matter of rotating the matrix 90 degrees, but that would change the structure completely, which isn't the case here.\n\nAnother angle: looking at the sum of elements. But in Example0, the input and output sums may vary. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation involves shifting each row to the right by one position, with the last element wrapping around to the next row. Let's see:\n\nExample1's input row0:3,5,1. Shifted right would be1,3,5. But output row0 is3,8,1. Doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. Let's try to look for a different pattern. For Example0, the output's third row is [5,5,4,3,6]. The input's third row is [8,8,4,3,6]. So the first two elements changed from8,8 to5,5. Where do these 5s come from? Looking at input's row2, which is [8,5,5,5,2]. So the first element of row3's output is5, which might be from row2's column1 (5). Similarly, the second element of row3's output is5, which might be from row2's column2 (5). So maybe elements are taken from the row above.\n\nIn Example0's output row3: [5,5,4,3,6]. The first two elements are5,5. Input's row2 has [8,5,5,5,2]. So perhaps the first two elements of row3's output are taken from row2's elements:5 (from row2, column1) and5 (row2, column2). But why?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output matrix is a combination of elements from the input matrix shifted in a certain pattern. For example, even rows are shifted left, and odd rows are shifted right. But this doesn't seem to fit.\n\nAlternatively, the transformation might be that for each cell (i,j), the output is the input's cell (j, i) from the mirrored matrix. But I'm not sure.\n\nThis is getting quite challenging. Let's try to find another approach. Let's compare the positions that change in each example.\n\nFor Example0:\n\n- In row0, the last three elements change from8,8,8 to5,5,5. The 5s could be from row1's elements:5,5,6. But the output has three 5s. So maybe the first three elements of row1 are taken and reversed or something.\n\nWait, row1's first three elements are5,5,6. The output row0's last three are5,5,5. Not matching. Hmm.\n\nIn Example0's output row1: [8,8,6,8,4]. The first two elements are8,8. Input row0's third and fourth elements are8,8. So perhaps those are taken from there. The third element is6 (same as input row1's third). The fourth element is8, which is from input row2's third element (5). Not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each row is being shifted by one or more positions, and the direction depends on the row's parity. For example, even-indexed rows (0,2,4) are shifted right, and odd-indexed rows are shifted left. But this doesn't seem to fit the examples.\n\nAnother observation: In Example0, the output's row0 has elements from the original row0 and row1. For example, the first two elements are from row0, and the next three from row1. But row0's output is [2,7,5,5,5]. The 5s are present in row1's first two elements. So maybe the first two elements are kept, and the rest are replaced with the first elements of the next row. Not exactly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation involves taking elements from a diagonal. For Example1, the output's (0,1) is8, which is (1,2) in input. (1,2) is input's 8. Then (1,2) in output is5, which is input's (0,1). So it's a swap between (0,1) and (1,2). Also, (1,1) becomes8. So maybe swapping (0,1) and (1,2), and (1,1) takes the value of (1,2) or (0,1). \n\nIn Example2's input, (0,1) is5. Output's (0,1) is8. Which in input's (1,0) is5, (2,0) is8. So maybe taking from (2,0). Output's row1, column0 is8 (from input's row2, column0). Output's row1, column2 is8 (from input's row0, column2 is3. No. Or row2, column1 is8. So perhaps output's (1,2) is8 from (2,1). \n\nThis seems like elements are being taken from a certain relative position. For example, each element (i,j) in the output is taken from (i+1,j-1) of the input. Let's test this for Example1's (0,1):\n\ni=0+1=1, j=1-1=0. Input's (1,0) is4. Output is8. No.\n\nAlternatively, (i-1, j+1). For Example1's (0,1):\n\ni-1=-1 (wrap around?), j+1=2. If we wrap around, last row (2) for i-1=-1. So input's row2, column2 is9. But output is8. Doesn't match.\n\nAlternatively, maybe for each element (i,j), output is the maximum of its neighbors. But in Example1, (0,1) has neighbors 3,1,4,5. The maximum is5, but output is8. So no.\n\nAlternatively, the output elements are from a diagonal shift. For example, elements are shifted diagonally down-right. Let's see:\n\nIn Example1, output (0,1) is8, which is input (1,2). Then, output (1,2) is5, which is input (0,1). So this is a swap between (0,1) and (1,2). Similarly, in Example2's output (0,1) is8, which is input (1,0) or (2,0). \n\nWait, in Example2's input:\n\noutput (0,1)=8. Input's (1,0)=5 and (2,0)=8. So (2,0)=8. output's (0,1) is8. \n\noutput's (1,0)=8, which is input's (2,0)=8. \n\noutput's (1,2)=8, which is input's (2,1)=8. \n\noutput's (2,0)=5, which is input's (1,0)=5. \n\noutput's (2,1)=5, which is input's (1,1)=7? No. Hmm.\n\nSo perhaps elements are being moved in a way that each element (i,j) in the output is taken from (i+1,j) of the input, except for the last row which takes from the first row. But in Example2's output (0,1) is8, which would be input (1,1)=7. Doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, for each element (i,j) in the output:\n\n- If i is even, take from (i+1,j) of input.\n\n- If i is odd, take from (i-1,j) of input.\n\nFor Example1's output row0, column1 (i=0 even): take from (1,1)=5. But output is8. So no.\n\nThis is really challenging. Let's try to find another approach. Let's look at the Test Input and see if we can spot a pattern when applying possible transformations.\n\nTest Input:\n\n[8,8,4,5]\n[3,8,7,5]\n[3,7,1,9]\n[6,4,8,8]\n\nExpected Output: ?\n\nAssuming the pattern is similar to the training examples.\n\nLooking at the training examples, especially the 3x3 and 5x5 matrices, there's a possibility that each layer (outer ring) is rotated clockwise or counter-clockwise. For a 4x4 matrix, the outer layer would include all elements of the first and fourth rows and the first and fourth columns.\n\nIf the outer layer is rotated clockwise, each element moves to the next position in the ring.\n\nFor example, the first row elements (excluding the last element) move to the right, the last column elements (excluding last) move down, the last row elements (excluding first) move to the left, and the first column elements (excluding first) move up.\n\nLet's try applying this to the Test Input.\n\nTest Input's outer layer:\n\nRow0:8,8,4,5\n\nRow1:3, _, _,5\n\nRow2:3, _, _,9\n\nRow3:6,4,8,8\n\nColumns:\n\nColumn0:8,3,3,6\n\nColumn3:5,5,9,8\n\nThe outer layer elements are:\n\nRow0:8,8,4,5\n\nRow1:3 (column0), 5 (column3)\n\nRow2:3 (column0),9 (column3)\n\nRow3:6,4,8,8\n\nIf we rotate this outer layer clockwise by one position:\n\n- The first element of row0 (8) moves to the position below it (row1, column0).\n\n- The rest of row0's elements shift right: 8\u21928's position, 4\u21924's position,5\u21925's position. But the last element (5) moves down to row1, column3.\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to think of the outer layer as a list and rotate it.\n\nThe outer layer elements in order (top row, right column, bottom row reversed, left column reversed):\n\nTop row:8,8,4,5\n\nRight column:5 (from row0, column3),5 (row1, column3),9 (row2, column3),8 (row3, column3)\n\nBottom row reversed:8,8,4,6 (original row3 is [6,4,8,8], reversed is 8,8,4,6)\n\nLeft column reversed:3 (row2, column0),3 (row1, column0),8 (row0, column0)\n\nBut this seems complex. Alternatively, the outer ring elements are:\n\nTop row:8,8,4,5\n\nRight column (excluding top):5,9,8\n\nBottom row (reversed):8,8,4,6\n\nLeft column (excluding bottom):3,3\n\nThis is getting complicated. Let's try to create a list of the outer elements in order:\n\nStarting from row0, column0:8 \u2192 row0, column1:8 \u2192 row0, column2:4 \u2192 row0, column3:5 \u2192 row1, column3:5 \u2192 row2, column3:9 \u2192 row3, column3:8 \u2192 row3, column2:8 \u2192 row3, column1:4 \u2192 row3, column0:6 \u2192 row2, column0:3 \u2192 row1, column0:3 \u2192 back to row0, column0:8.\n\nSo the list of outer elements is:8,8,4,5,5,9,8,8,4,6,3,3.\n\nRotating this list clockwise by one would move each element to the next position. So the new list starts with the last element:3,8,8,4,5,5,9,8,8,4,6,3.\n\nNow, place these elements back into the outer ring:\n\nNew row0:3,8,8,4\n\nNew right column (row0, column3=4 is not possible. Wait, this approach isn't working. Maybe rotating the outer ring elements clockwise by one position.\n\nOriginal outer elements in order (top to right to bottom to left):\n\nTop row left to right:8,8,4,5\n\nRight column top to bottom:5,5,9,8\n\nBottom row right to left:8,4,8,6\n\nLeft column bottom to top:3,3,8\n\nWait, but this is a 4x4 matrix, so the outer ring has 4 elements in each row and column, but the left column would be row0, column0; row1, column0; row2, column0; row3, column0.\n\nBut when rotating, each element moves to the next position. For example:\n\nThe top row's last element (5) moves to the right column's first position (row0, column3). The right column's last element (8) moves to the bottom row's last position (row3, column3). The bottom row's last element (6) moves to the left column's last position (row3, column0). The left column's first element (3) moves to the top row's first position (row0, column0). \n\nBut how does this look when rotated?\n\nAfter rotation, the elements would shift as follows:\n\n- New top row: each element moves to the right. The last element (5) goes to the right column's first position.\n\n- New right column: each element moves down. The last element (8) goes to the bottom row's last position.\n\n- New bottom row: reversed and shifted left. The last element (6) goes to the left column's last position.\n\n- New left column: each element moves up. The first element (3) goes to the top row's first position.\n\nSo after a clockwise rotation of the outer ring:\n\nNew top row would be: left column's elements (from bottom to top) except the last, followed by the right column's last element. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rotation of the outer ring causes each element to shift one position clockwise.\n\nFor example, original outer elements:\n\nTop row:8,8,4,5\n\nRight column:5,5,9,8\n\nBottom row:6,4,8,8 (reverse of row3:6,4,8,8 \u2192 reversed is8,8,4,6)\n\nLeft column:3,3,7,8 (from row1, column0:3; row2, column0:3; row3, column0:6 \u2192 but no, row3, column0 is6. So left column is8 (row0, column0),3 (row1, column0),3 (row2, column0),6 (row3, column0). But rotating this column as part of the outer ring. \n\nThis is getting too time-consuming. Given the time constraints, perhaps the pattern is that each layer (outer, then inner) is rotated clockwise. For the test input, a 4x4 matrix, rotating the outer layer clockwise and leaving the inner layers as is.\n\nApplying that to the Test Input:\n\nOriginal outer layer:\n\nRow0:8,8,4,5\n\nRow1:3,    ,    ,5\n\nRow2:3,    ,    ,9\n\nRow3:6,4,8,8\n\nAfter rotating the outer layer clockwise once:\n\n- The top row becomes the left column in reverse.\n\n- The right column becomes the top row.\n\n- The bottom row becomes the right column in reverse.\n\n- The left column becomes the bottom row.\n\nWait, maybe that's the way to rotate the outer layer.\n\nLet's try:\n\nOriginal top row:8,8,4,5 \u2192 becomes the new right column.\n\nOriginal right column:5,5,9,8 \u2192 becomes the new bottom row in reverse.\n\nOriginal bottom row (row3):6,4,8,8 \u2192 becomes new left column in reverse.\n\nOriginal left column:8,3,3,6 \u2192 becomes new top row in reverse.\n\nBut this is a standard matrix rotation. For a clockwise rotation, the top row becomes the right column, but reversed.\n\nBut in the given training examples, the outputs don't seem to be full rotations. For example, in Example0, rotating the outer layer would change more elements than observed. So perhaps the pattern isn't a full rotation but a partial shift.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the first and last elements of each row are rotated with adjacent rows.\n\nGiven that I'm stuck, perhaps I should look for another pattern. Let's consider that in each example, the elements around the center (for odd-sized matrices) or in the cross (for even-sized) are rotated, but for even-sized matrices, there's no single center. For the test input which is 4x4, perhaps each 2x2 block is rotated or transformed.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the pattern is that for each cell (i,j), the output cell is the input's cell (j, i) for even i+j, and something else for odd i+j. But I need to check.\n\nExample1's output row0, column1 is8. Input (1,2) is8. So i+j=0+1=1 (odd). If for odd i+j, output is input's (j,i), then (0,1) would be (1,0)=4. Not matching. So no.\n\nAnother approach: looking at the elements that change between input and output.\n\nIn Example0, the elements that change are mostly in the first few rows. For example, row0's last three elements change from 8,8,8 to5,5,5. These 5s come from the row below (row1's first three elements:5,5,6). But the output has 5,5,5. Hmm. So maybe the first three elements of row1 are taken and the third element is replaced with5. Not sure.\n\nIn Example1, the changes are in the middle elements. It seems like a cross (row and column) are being manipulated.\n\nIn Example2, the changes are around the edges. For instance, the first and last elements of the rows are changed.\n\nThis suggests that the pattern might involve rotating or swapping elements in the cross (for odd-sized matrices) and rotating the outer layers for even-sized matrices.\n\nGiven the test input is 4x4, which is even-sized, perhaps the outer layer is rotated clockwise, and the inner layer (if any) is rotated as well. Let's try applying that to the test input.\n\nTest Input:\n\nOriginal outer layer:\n\nRow0:8,8,4,5\n\nRow1:3,    ,    ,5\n\nRow2:3,    ,    ,9\n\nRow3:6,4,8,8\n\nInner layer (if any): since it's 4x4, the inner layer is the 2x2 matrix:\n\n[8,7]\n\n[7,1]\n\nBut rotating this inner layer may not be necessary.\n\nAssuming the outer layer is rotated clockwise once.\n\nRotating the outer layer clockwise:\n\n- The top row becomes the right column, reversed.\n\nOriginal top row:8,8,4,5 \u2192 becomes the right column in reverse:5,4,8,8. But right column is row0-col3, row1-col3, row2-col3, row3-col3. So new right column would be5,4,8,8.\n\nBut wait, the original right column is5,5,9,8. Rotating the outer layer clockwise would involve moving each element to the next position. So:\n\n- The top row elements move to the right column.\n\n- The right column elements move to the bottom row.\n\n- The bottom row elements move to the left column.\n\n- The left column elements move to the top row.\n\nSo rotating clockwise:\n\nNew top row: left column reversed (6,3,3,8) \u2192 no, original left column is8,3,3,6 (row0-col0, row1-col0, row2-col0, row3-col0). Reversed left column is6,3,3,8.\n\nBut when rotating, each element moves one position. So the first element of the top row (8) moves to the position of the first element of the right column. The first element of the right column (5) moves to the position of the first element of the bottom row. The first element of the bottom row (6) moves to the first element of the left column. The first element of the left column (8) moves to the first element of the top row.\n\nWait, but this is a bit complicated. Let's list all the outer elements in order:\n\nTop row left to right:8,8,4,5\n\nRight column top to bottom:5,5,9,8\n\nBottom row right to left:8,8,4,6\n\nLeft column bottom to top:6,3,3,8\n\nWhen rotated clockwise, each element moves to the next position in this sequence. So the new sequence becomes:\n\n6 (from left column bottom to top),8,8,4,5,5,9,8,8,4,6,3.\n\nBut this isn't straightforward. Alternatively, think of the outer ring as a list:\n\n[8,8,4,5,5,5,9,8,8,8,4,6,3,3,8]\n\nWait, perhaps not. For a 4x4 matrix, the outer ring has 4*4 - 2*2 = 12 elements. Let's list them in order:\n\nTop row:8,8,4,5\n\nRight column:5,5,9,8 (from row1 to row3)\n\nBottom row:8,4,8,6 (row3 in reverse order)\n\nLeft column:3,3,8 (row1 to row3, but row0's left column is8 already considered)\n\nWait, this is confusing. \n\nAn alternative method for rotating the outer layer of a matrix clockwise by one position:\n\nFor each layer in the matrix, rotate the elements along the top row, right column, bottom row, and left column in a clockwise manner.\n\nFor example, take the top row from left to right, right column from top to bottom, bottom row from right to left, and left column from bottom to top. This forms a ring of elements. Rotating this ring clockwise by one position means each element moves to the next position, with the first element going to the second position, and the last element wrapping to the first.\n\nFor the test input's outer ring:\n\nTop row:8,8,4,5\n\nRight column:5,5,9,8\n\nBottom row (reversed):8,8,4,6\n\nLeft column (reversed):3,3,8,6 (wait, row3's left column is6, row2's is3, row1's is3, row0's is8. So reversed left column (from bottom to top) is6,3,3,8.\n\nSo the outer ring elements in order are:\n\n8,8,4,5,5,5,9,8,8,8,4,6,6,3,3,8. But this is too many elements. Wait, correct count is 4 (top) + 4 (right) + 4 (bottom) + 4 (left) - 4 corners (since they're counted twice) = 12 elements.\n\nSo the correct outer ring elements are:\n\nTop row:8,8,4,5\n\nRight column (excluding top and bottom):5,9\n\nBottom row (reversed, excluding corners):8,4\n\nLeft column (excluding top and bottom):3,3\n\nWait, this is incorrect. Let me count again.\n\nFor a 4x4 matrix, the outer ring has:\n\n- Top row:4 elements.\n\n- Right column:4 elements, but top and bottom are already counted in the top and bottom rows. So right column has 2 elements (row1 and row2).\n\n- Bottom row:4 elements, but left and right are already counted.\n\n- Left column:4 elements, but top and bottom are already counted. So left column has 2 elements (row1 and row2).\n\nWait, no. The outer ring of a 4x4 matrix includes:\n\nAll elements of the first and last rows, and the first and last columns, but excluding the corners which are already counted in the rows.\n\nSo:\n\nTop row:8,8,4,5 (includes corners 8 and5)\n\nRight column:5,5,9,8 (includes corners5 and8)\n\nBottom row:6,4,8,8 (includes corners6 and8)\n\nLeft column:8,3,3,6 (includes corners8 and6)\n\nBut when forming the ring, the corners are counted once. So the correct order to list the outer elements is:\n\nTop row left to right:8,8,4,5\n\nRight column top to bottom (excluding top and bottom elements):5,9\n\nBottom row right to left (excluding corners):8,4\n\nLeft column bottom to top (excluding top and bottom elements):3,3\n\nSo the outer ring elements in order are:8,8,4,5,5,9,8,4,3,3,6,8. Wait, not sure. This is getting too complex. Maybe there's a better way.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and the lack of progress, I'll make an educated guess based on the examples, especially the 3x3 ones where the middle elements are involved. For the test input, which is 4x4, perhaps the transformation involves rotating each 2x2 block in a certain way. Alternatively, the output is generated by rotating the matrix's layers clockwise.\n\nAssuming the outer layer is rotated clockwise once:\n\nOriginal Test Input outer elements:\n\nRow0:8,8,4,5\n\nRow1:3, ., .,5\n\nRow2:3, ., .,9\n\nRow3:6,4,8,8\n\nAfter rotating the outer layer clockwise:\n\nNew top row:6,3,3,8 (left column in reverse)\n\nNew right column:8,5,9,5 (original top row reversed?)\n\nNew bottom row:8,4,8,5 (original right column?)\n\nNew left column:8,3,3,6 (original bottom row reversed?)\n\nBut I'm not confident. Alternatively, the new top row would be the left column reversed. Left column is8,3,3,6 \u2192 reversed is6,3,3,8. So new top row is6,3,3,8. New right column is original top row's elements:8,8,4,5. New bottom row is original right column reversed:8,5,9,5 \u2192 reversed is5,9,5,8. New left column is original bottom row:6,4,8,8 \u2192 reversed is8,8,4,6.\n\nPutting this together:\n\nNew matrix after rotation would be:\n\nRow0:6,3,3,8\n\nRow1:8,8,.,5\n\nRow2:4,.,.,9\n\nRow3:5,9,5,8\n\nBut this doesn't match the examples' patterns and seems arbitrary.\n\nGiven the time I've invested and the lack of a clear pattern, I'll proceed to make an educated guess based on the examples. For each test case, it seems like elements from the surrounding rows and columns are being swapped or rotated around. For the test input, which is a 4x4 matrix, perhaps the outer layer is rotated clockwise once, leading to the following output:\n\n[6, 3, 3, 8]\n[8, 8, 7, 5]\n[4, 7, 1, 9]\n[5, 9, 5, 8]\n\nBut this is a guess. Alternatively, based on Example1 and 2, where elements around the center are swapped, perhaps in the test input's case, elements around the two central rows/columns are swapped. For example:\n\nLooking at the test input's rows:\n\n[8,8,4,5]\n[3,8,7,5]\n[3,7,1,9]\n[6,4,8,8]\n\nPossible output could involve swapping elements between rows 0 and 1, and rows 2 and 3, and columns 0 and 3.\n\nAlternatively, after analyzing the examples, I might consider that the transformation involves rotating each ring clockwise. For the test input's outer ring, rotating once:\n\nOriginal outer ring elements in order (top row, right column, bottom row reversed, left column reversed):\n\n8,8,4,5,5,9,8,8,4,6,3,3\n\nAfter rotation, they become:\n\n3,8,8,4,5,5,9,8,8,4,6,3\n\nPlacing them back into the outer ring:\n\nTop row:3,8,4,5\n\nRight column:5,5,9,8\n\nBottom row:6,4,8,8\n\nLeft column:3,3,8,8\n\nBut this doesn't match any example. I'm not confident. Given the time, I'll proceed to hypothesize that the answer involves rotating layers and provide the following output based on rotating the outer layer clockwise once and inner layers if any."
