        "cot_1": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. So, looking at the training examples, each input is a 5x7 grid of numbers, and the output is a 3x3 grid. The goal is to see how they transform the input into the output.\n\nLet me start by examining Example 0. The input has a lot of 8s. The output is a 3x3 matrix with 8s arranged in a sort of cross shape. The middle of the output is 8, surrounded by 8s in the corners? Wait, no. Wait, the output is [0,8,0], [8,8,8], [0,8,0]. Hmm, so the center is 8, and the middle row is all 8s, with the top and bottom middle being 8. Maybe it's taking some kind of center elements or combining rows and columns.\n\nLooking at Example 0's input: the middle row (third row) is all zeros, but the output's middle row is all 8s. That's interesting. So maybe the middle row of the output isn't directly from the middle of the input. Let me look at other examples.\n\nTake Example 1. The output is [2,2,2], [0,2,2], [2,0,2]. The input here has varying numbers. Maybe the transformation involves combining specific rows and columns. Let's see the input rows:\n\nFirst input row: [2,2,0,0,0,2,2]\nSecond row: [0,0,0,0,0,0,2]\nThird row: all zeros.\nFourth row: [0,2,0,0,0,2,0]\nFifth row: [2,0,0,0,0,0,2]\n\nThe output is a 3x3. Maybe each row of the output is derived from the corresponding first, third, and fifth rows of the input? Let's check. For Example 0, the input has rows 0,1,2,3,4. The output rows might come from rows 0, 2, 4? Let's see. Example 0's input row 0 is [0,8,0,0,0,8,0], row 2 is all zeros, row 4 is [0,8,0,0,0,8,0]. The output's first row is [0,8,0], middle is [8,8,8], last is [0,8,0]. Hmm, not sure. Maybe they are combining certain columns.\n\nLooking at columns. For Example 0's input, each row has 7 elements. The output has 3 elements per row. Maybe taking columns 1, 3, 5? Let's check. In Example 0's first input row, columns 1 and 5 are 8. The output's first row is [0,8,0]. Wait, the input's first row has elements 0,8,0,0,0,8,0. If columns are 0-based, maybe columns 1, 3, 5. So positions 1 is 8, 3 is 0, 5 is 8. But the output's first row is 0,8,0. That doesn't align. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is taking the middle three elements of certain rows? Wait, the input rows are 7 elements, so middle three would be positions 2,3,4. But in Example 0's first input row, those are 0,0,0, which doesn't match the output's first row [0,8,0]. That doesn't fit.\n\nWait, perhaps the output is formed by combining the first, third, and fifth rows of the input, and taking the middle three columns. Let's check for Example 0. The input rows 0, 2, 4. So row 0: [0,8,0,0,0,8,0], row 2: all zeros, row 4: [0,8,0,0,0,8,0]. If we take the middle three columns (columns 2,3,4?), which are 0,0,0 for row 0. But the output's first row is [0,8,0]. Hmm, that doesn't match.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output rows are formed by taking elements from specific positions in the input rows. Let's look at Example 1's output:\n\nOutput row 0: [2,2,2]. The input's first row is [2,2,0,0,0,2,2]. If the output takes the first, third, and fifth elements of each row? For the first input row, elements 0, 2, 4, 6. Wait, maybe the first, fourth, and seventh elements? But the input rows have 7 elements. Let's see: for row 0, first element is 2, fourth is 0, seventh is 2. So [2,0,2], but output row 0 is [2,2,2]. Not matching.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is built from the first, middle, and last rows of the input, and then the first, middle, and last elements of those rows. For example, in Example 0:\n\nInput rows 0, 2, 4. For each of those rows, take elements 0, 3, 6 (first, middle, last). So row 0: 0,0,0 \u2192 but output row 0 is [0,8,0]. Doesn't fit.\n\nWait, maybe the output is constructed by taking the first, third, and fifth rows of the input, and then the first, third, and fifth columns. Let's try that for Example 0:\n\nRows 0,2,4. Columns 0, 2,4. So row 0: 0 (col0), 0 (col2), 0 (col4) \u2192 [0,0,0], but output's first row is [0,8,0]. Doesn't match.\n\nHmm. Maybe another approach. Let's look for symmetry in the input and output. For Example 0, the input is symmetric. The output is a cross pattern. Maybe it's detecting the presence of non-zero elements in certain positions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each element in the output 3x3 grid corresponds to a specific position in the input grid. For example, the top-left of the output could be the top-left of the input, but considering overlapping or certain regions.\n\nWait, looking at Example 0's input and output:\n\nInput is 5 rows, 7 columns. Output is 3x3. So maybe each output cell is a sum or presence of certain cells in the input.\n\nAlternatively, think of the input as layers. The output is the center of the input. But since the input is 5x7, the center would be row 2 and columns 3. But output is 3x3. Maybe each output row is a combination of input rows, and each column is a combination of input columns.\n\nWait, in Example 0's output:\n\nFirst row: 0,8,0. Maybe this comes from the first input row's elements 1 and 5 (which are 8s). Then the middle element (8) comes from row 1, column 3? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the maximum value in each quadrant. But the input is divided into 3x3 sections. For example, split the 5x7 input into a 3x3 grid where each section is a group of cells. Then take the max or sum of each group. Let's check.\n\nFor Example 0, the input is 5 rows by 7 columns. To split into 3x3 sections, each section's size might vary. For rows: 5 rows can be divided as 2 rows, 1 row, 2 rows. For columns: 7 columns can be divided as 2,3,2. So each section is:\n\nRow 0-1, columns 0-1: [0,8] and [8,8]. The max here would be 8. But the output's top-left is 0. Hmm, not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by the middle three columns of the middle three rows. Wait, the input is 5 rows, so middle three would be rows 1,2,3. Columns 7, middle three would be 2,3,4. So for Example 0, rows 1,2,3 and columns 2,3,4. Let's see:\n\nRow1: 8,8,0,0,0,8,8 \u2192 columns 2,3,4 are 0,0,0 \u2192 [0,0,0]\n\nRow2: all zeros \u2192 [0,0,0]\n\nRow3: same as row1 \u2192 [0,0,0]\n\nSo that would give a 3x3 of all zeros, but the output is different. So that's not it.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps the output is formed by taking the non-zero elements from the corners and centers. For example, in Example 0's input:\n\nThe first row starts and ends with 0, but has 8s in positions 1 and 5. The output's first row is [0,8,0]. Maybe the output is taking the first, middle, and last elements of certain rows. Let's see:\n\nTake the first, third, and fifth rows of the input. For each of these rows, take elements 1,3,5 (since columns are 0-based). For Example 0:\n\nRow0: elements 1=8, 3=0,5=8 \u2192 [8,0,8]. But output row0 is [0,8,0]. Hmm, not matching. Unless the output is taking the sum or some other operation.\n\nWait, maybe the output's positions are derived from the input's diagonals or cross. Let's think of the input as a 5x7 grid. The output is a 3x3 grid where each cell corresponds to a specific direction. Maybe the middle cell is the sum or maximum of the central area, and the others are from the surrounding.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is a compression of the input. For example, each row in the output is formed by combining the first and last elements of the input's rows. But I need to find a pattern that works across all examples.\n\nLet's take Example 1. Input's first row: [2,2,0,0,0,2,2]. Output's first row: [2,2,2]. Maybe taking the first, middle, and last elements of the first row: 2,0,2 \u2192 but output is 2,2,2. Not matching. But maybe sum the first two and last two elements. For example, first two 2+2=4, but output is 2. Not sure.\n\nLooking at Example 3's input and output. Input's first row is [4,0,0,0,0,0,4]. Output's first row is [4,0,4]. So that's taking the first and last elements. Then the third row of the output is [4,4,4], which corresponds to the fifth row of the input: [4,0,0,0,0,4,4]. So first element is 4, last two are 4,4. So output row3 is [4,4,4]. So perhaps each row in the output is constructed by taking the first, middle, and last element of the corresponding row in the input. Let's check.\n\nIn Example 3's input:\n\nOutput row0: [4,0,4]. Input row0 (first row) has first element 4, middle (position 3) is 0, last is 4. That matches. Output row1: [0,0,0]. Input row1 (second row) is all zeros, so first, middle, last are 0. Output row2: [4,4,4]. Input row4 (fifth row) is [4,0,0,0,0,4,4]. First is 4, middle (position3) is 0, last is4. Wait, but output is [4,4,4]. Hmm, that doesn't fit. Unless it's a different row.\n\nWait the output has 3 rows. Maybe the output's rows correspond to input's rows 0,2,4. Let's check for Example3. Output rows 0,1,2 correspond to input rows 0,2,4.\n\nInput row0: [4,0,0,0,0,0,4] \u2192 first (4), middle (0), last (4) \u2192 [4,0,4] matches output row0.\n\nInput row2: all zeros \u2192 [0,0,0] matches output row1.\n\nInput row4: [4,0,0,0,0,4,4] \u2192 first (4), middle (0), last (4). But output row2 is [4,4,4]. So this doesn't fit. So this approach is not correct.\n\nHmm. Let me think again. Maybe the output is taking certain columns from the input's rows. For example, for each of the three rows in the output (rows 0,1,2), they correspond to input rows 0, 2, 4, and each output row takes columns 0, 3, 6 (the first, middle, and last column indices of the 7-column input). Let's check Example0:\n\nInput row0: [0,8,0,0,0,8,0]. Columns 0:0, 3:0, 6:0 \u2192 output row0 would be [0,0,0], but the actual output is [0,8,0]. So that's not matching.\n\nWait, maybe columns 1,3,5? For row0: 8,0,8 \u2192 [8,0,8]. Output row0 is [0,8,0]. Not matching. So maybe columns 0,3,6, but then sum or some other operation.\n\nAlternatively, for the output's middle row, maybe combining elements from multiple input rows. For example, in Example0's output middle row is [8,8,8]. The input's middle row (row2) is all zeros. So that can't be. But looking at input rows around the middle, maybe row1 and row3. Row1 and row3 in Example0 are [8,8,0,0,0,8,8]. If we take their columns 0,3,6: 8,0,8 \u2192 but output's middle row is all 8s. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is created by looking for the presence of numbers in certain positions. For example, the output's top-left is the number that appears in the top-left and top-right of the input. Not sure.\n\nAnother approach: look at how the output for each example relates to the input. For Example0, the output is a diamond shape of 8s. The input has 8s forming a sort of hourglass. Maybe the output is a condensed version of the input's non-zero elements. Like, the output is a 3x3 grid where each cell represents a 2x2 or similar area in the input, taking the maximum or sum. Let's check.\n\nExample0's input has 5 rows. Maybe the output rows are formed by combining two rows each. For example, rows 0 and 1, row 2, rows 3 and 4. But how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each cell in the output is the sum of the corresponding quadrant in the input. For a 5x7 input divided into 3x3 regions, each output cell covers a section. Let's see:\n\nDivide input into 3 rows (2 rows, 1 row, 2 rows) and 3 columns (3 cols, 1 col, 3 cols). For example:\n\n- Rows 0-1, 2, 3-4\n- Columns 0-2, 3, 4-6\n\nThen each output cell is the maximum or sum of that region.\n\nFor Example0's output [0,8,0] in row0. Let's take the top-middle region (columns 3). But the input's top rows 0-1 and column3 would have elements from row0:0, row1:0. So sum is 0. But the output's middle is 8. Not matching.\n\nHmm. This is getting complicated. Let me think of another angle.\n\nLooking at the outputs: each output is a 3x3 grid. The numbers in the output seem to correspond to the numbers in the input. For instance, in Example0, all outputs are 8s and 0s, same as the input. Similarly, Example1 uses 2s, Example3 uses 4s, etc. So the output numbers are the same as the input's numbers. So the pattern isn't about changing the numbers but their positions.\n\nWait, looking at Example1's output:\n\nOutput:\n[2,2,2]\n[0,2,2]\n[2,0,2]\n\nInput has a lot of 2s in the first and fifth rows, and some in the fourth row. Maybe the output is built by taking the first element from the first row, the middle from the third row, etc. Not sure.\n\nLet me compare the positions of non-zero elements in the input and output for each example.\n\nTake Example0's input and output:\n\nInput non-zero positions (0-based):\n\nRow0: positions 1 and 5 (8s)\nRow1: positions 0,1,5,6 (8s)\nRow3: same as row1\nRow4: same as row0\nRow2: all zeros.\n\nOutput non-zero positions:\n\nRow0: position1 (8)\nRow1: positions0,1,2 (8s)\nRow2: position1 (8)\n\nSo the output has a vertical line in the middle column and a horizontal line in the middle row. So it's a cross.\n\nThe input's non-zero elements form an hourglass shape. So maybe the output is the intersection or the center of that hourglass.\n\nAlternatively, the output could be the central part of the input. But the input is 5x7; the central part would be 3x3, but how? Let's see:\n\nIn a 5x7 grid, the exact center is row2 (third row) and column3 (fourth column). A 3x3 around that would be rows1-3 and columns2-4.\n\nFor Example0, rows1-3 and columns2-4:\n\nRow1: [0,0,0]\nRow2: [0,0,0]\nRow3: [0,0,0]\n\nAll zeros, but the output is a cross of 8s. So that's not it.\n\nAnother approach: the output could be a compression where each element in the output is the sum of the corresponding diagonal elements in the input. For example, the top-left of the output is the sum of the top-left, middle, and bottom-right of the input.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is constructed by taking the first, third, and fifth elements from the first, third, and fifth rows of the input. Let's check Example0:\n\nInput rows 0,2,4:\n\nRow0: [0,8,0,0,0,8,0]\nRow2: all zeros\nRow4: [0,8,0,0,0,8,0]\n\nTaking elements 0, 3, 6 (first, middle, last) from each of these rows:\n\nRow0: 0,0,0 \u2192 [0,0,0] but output row0 is [0,8,0].\n\nHmm, not matching.\n\nWait, maybe elements 1,3,5 from these rows:\n\nRow0: 8,0,8 \u2192 [8,0,8], but output row0 is [0,8,0]. Not matching.\n\nAlternatively, elements 0,3,6 from row0, elements 0,3,6 from row2, and elements 0,3,6 from row4. For Example0:\n\nRow0:0,0,0 \u2192 [0,0,0]\n\nRow2:0,0,0 \u2192 [0,0,0]\n\nRow4:0,0,0 \u2192 [0,0,0]\n\nBut the output is not all zeros. So that's not it.\n\nLet me think of the outputs. They all are 3x3 grids, and in some cases, the numbers form certain patterns. For example, in Example0, it's a cross. In Example1, the first row is all 2s, second row starts with 0, etc.\n\nLooking at the input and output of Example3:\n\nInput's first row is [4,0,0,0,0,0,4], which becomes output's first row [4,0,4]. The fifth row is [4,0,0,0,0,4,4], which becomes [4,4,4]. So maybe the output takes the first and last elements of the first and fifth rows, and something from the middle.\n\nAlternatively, the first row of the output is the first element, middle element, and last element of the first row of the input. The third row of the output is the first, middle, and last elements of the fifth row. The middle row of the output is from the third row of the input, but that's all zeros in Example3. But in Example3's output, the middle row is [0,0,0], which matches the third row of the input.\n\nSo perhaps the output is structured as:\n\nRow0: first, middle, last of input row0\n\nRow1: first, middle, last of input row2\n\nRow2: first, middle, last of input row4\n\nLet's test this hypothesis with all examples.\n\nExample0:\n\nInput row0: [0,8,0,0,0,8,0]\n\nFirst element:0, middle (index3):0, last:0 \u2192 output row0 [0,0,0]. But actual output row0 is [0,8,0]. So this doesn't fit. So the hypothesis is incorrect.\n\nExample1:\n\nInput row0: [2,2,0,0,0,2,2] \u2192 first 2, middle (index3) 0, last 2 \u2192 [2,0,2]. Output row0 is [2,2,2]. Doesn't match.\n\nExample3:\n\nInput row0: [4,0,0,0,0,0,4] \u2192 first 4, middle 0, last4 \u2192 [4,0,4] matches output row0.\n\nInput row2: all zeros \u2192 [0,0,0] matches output row1.\n\nInput row4: [4,0,0,0,0,4,4] \u2192 first4, middle (index3)0, last4 \u2192 [4,0,4], but output row2 is [4,4,4]. Doesn't match.\n\nHmm. So this works for row0 and row1 of Example3 but not row2.\n\nAlternative idea: maybe the output's rows are built from the first, third, and fifth rows of the input, but each output row is the first, third, and fifth elements of those input rows.\n\nFor Example0:\n\nRow0 of input: elements 0,2,4: 0,0,0 \u2192 [0,0,0], but output row0 is [0,8,0]. Doesn't fit.\n\nExample3's row4: elements0,2,4: 4,0,0 \u2192 [4,0,0], but output row2 is [4,4,4]. No.\n\nAnother approach: looking at how the non-zero elements in the output relate to their positions in the input.\n\nExample0's output has 8s in positions (0,1), (1,0), (1,1), (1,2), (2,1). Which forms a cross.\n\nLooking at the input's non-zero elements:\n\n- Rows0 and4 have 8s at positions1 and5.\n\n- Rows1 and3 have 8s at positions0,1,5,6.\n\nSo maybe the output is combining these positions. For instance, the output's top-middle (0,1) comes from input's row0, position1. The output's middle-left (1,0) comes from input's row1, position0. The output's middle (1,1) comes from input's row1, position3 (which is 0?), but in output it's 8. That doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output's positions are formed by combining certain rows and columns. For example:\n\n- Output cell (0,0) is the sum of input's cell (0,0) and (4,6). For Example0, 0+0=0. Output is 0. That matches.\n\n- Output cell (0,1) is input cell (0,1) \u2192 8. Output is 8. Matches.\n\n- Output cell (0,2) is input cell (0,6) \u2192 0. Output is 0. Matches.\n\n- Output cell (1,0) is input cell (1,0) \u21928. Output is8.\n\n- Output cell (1,1) is input cell (2,3) \u21920. But output is8. So that doesn't fit. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each output cell is the sum of the corresponding row and column in the input. For example:\n\nOutput cell (i,j) is the sum of input's rows i*2 and columns j*2. For a 3x3 output, rows 0,2,4 and columns 0,3,6.\n\nWait, let's check for Example0:\n\noutput cell (0,0) would be input row0, column0 \u21920.\n\ncell (0,1) \u2192 row0, column3 \u21920.\n\ncell (0,2) \u2192 row0, column6 \u21920. But the output's first row is [0,8,0]. Doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. I'm stuck. Let me try to find another pattern.\n\nLooking at Example0's output:\n\n[0,8,0]\n\n[8,8,8]\n\n[0,8,0]\n\nThis looks like a cross. The middle row is all 8s, and the middle column is all 8s except the ends. The input has 8s in the first and last columns of rows0 and4, and in the first and last columns of rows1 and3.\n\nMaybe the output is taking the non-zero elements from the edges and center. For example, the output's middle row is formed by the middle element of each row, but that doesn't work.\n\nWait, perhaps the output is constructed by taking the maximum value from each quadrant. Let's imagine dividing the input into a 3x3 grid of regions. For a 5x7 input, the regions could be:\n\nRows 0-1, 2, 3-4\n\nColumns 0-2, 3, 4-6\n\nSo each region is:\n\nTop-left: rows0-1, cols0-2\n\nTop-middle: rows0-1, col3\n\nTop-right: rows0-1, cols4-6\n\nMiddle-left: row2, cols0-2\n\nMiddle-middle: row2, col3\n\nMiddle-right: row2, cols4-6\n\nBottom-left: rows3-4, cols0-2\n\nBottom-middle: rows3-4, col3\n\nBottom-right: rows3-4, cols4-6\n\nThen, the output cell is the maximum value in each region.\n\nLet's check Example0:\n\nTop-left region (rows0-1, cols0-2):\n\nRow0: [0,8,0]\n\nRow1: [8,8,0]\n\nThe maximum here is 8. So output cell (0,0) would be 8. But the actual output (0,0) is 0. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe sum instead of max. Top-left sum for Example0 would be 0+8+0 +8+8+0 = 24. But output is 0, so not matching.\n\nAnother idea: the output is built by looking at the corners and center of the input. The input is 5x7, so the four corners are (0,0), (0,6), (4,0), (4,6). The center is (2,3). Maybe the output is a 3x3 where the corners are the sums or presence of these positions.\n\nBut the output's corners are (0,0), (0,2), (2,0), (2,2). For Example0, output corners are 0,0,0,0, which don't match input corners (0,0),0,0,0,0. So that's not it.\n\nHmm. Maybe the pattern is more about the symmetry. For example, in Example0, the input is symmetric along the vertical and horizontal axes, and the output is a cross. Perhaps the output is the intersection of the symmetric elements.\n\nAnother approach: look for the positions in the input that have non-zero values in all examples and see how they map to the output.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is formed by taking the first three non-zero elements from each row. But for Example0's input row0, the non-zero elements are at positions1 and5. So first three would be 8,8, but the output row0 is [0,8,0]. Doesn't fit.\n\nWait, perhaps the output is the sum of the first, middle, and last elements of each of the first, third, and fifth rows. For Example0:\n\nRows0,2,4.\n\nRow0: first0, middle0, last0 \u2192 sum0. Output row0 is [0,8,0]. So not.\n\nHmm. Let me think differently. The output is always 3x3. The input is 5x7. Maybe the output is formed by taking every other row and every other column. For example, rows0,2,4 and columns0,3,6. Let's check:\n\nFor Example0:\n\nRow0, columns0,3,6: 0,0,0 \u2192 [0,0,0]\n\nRow2, same \u2192 0,0,0\n\nRow4, same \u21920,0,0\n\nBut output is not all zeros. So no.\n\nAlternatively, columns1,3,5 for rows0,2,4.\n\nRow0:8,0,8 \u2192 [8,0,8]\n\nRow2:0,0,0 \u2192 [0,0,0]\n\nRow4:8,0,8 \u2192 [8,0,8]\n\nBut output's rows are [0,8,0], [8,8,8], [0,8,0]. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAnother thought: the output's middle cell is the sum or maximum of all the non-zero elements in the input. For Example0, the sum is many 8s. But the output's middle cell is8. But other cells are also 8. Not helpful.\n\nWait, maybe the output is formed by taking three elements from each of the first, middle, and last rows of the input. For example:\n\nFor each output row i:\n\n- Take elements from input row i*2 (so 0, 2,4)\n\n- And columns j*3 (0,3,6). But for a 3x3 output, that would be columns0,3,6.\n\nSo for Example0:\n\nRow0: columns0,3,6 \u2192 0,0,0 \u2192 [0,0,0]\n\nRow2: same \u21920,0,0\n\nRow4: same \u21920,0,0\n\nBut output isn't zeros. So no.\n\nAlternatively, columns1,3,5:\n\nRow0:8,0,8 \u2192 [8,0,8]\n\nRow2:0,0,0 \u2192 [0,0,0]\n\nRow4:8,0,8 \u2192 [8,0,8]\n\nBut output is different. Not matching.\n\nThis is frustrating. Let me look for another angle.\n\nIn Example1's input:\n\nThe output's first row is [2,2,2]. The input's first row has 2s in positions0,1,5,6. So perhaps the output's first row is taking the sum of the first two and last two elements. But that would be 2+2=4 and 2+2=4, but output is 2,2,2. Not matching.\n\nAlternatively, the output's first row is the first, fourth, and seventh elements of the input's first row. For Example1's first input row: [2,2,0,0,0,2,2]. First element2, fourth0, seventh2 \u2192 [2,0,2], but output is [2,2,2]. Doesn't match.\n\nWait, maybe the output is the maximum of certain adjacent elements. For example, each output cell is the maximum of three consecutive elements in the corresponding row and column.\n\nFor Example0's first row, output is [0,8,0]. Maybe the middle cell is the maximum of the three middle elements of the first row (0,0,0 \u2192 max 0?), but no. The input's first row has 8s at positions1 and5. So perhaps the output's first row is the maximum of the first three elements, the middle three, and the last three.\n\nFor Example0's first row:\n\nFirst three:0,8,0 \u2192 max 8\n\nMiddle three:0,0,0 \u2192 max 0\n\nLast three:8,0 \u2192 max 8. But output is [0,8,0]. Not matching.\n\nHmm.\n\nMaybe the output is a mirror or rotation of certain parts. For example, the first row of the output is the reversed third row of the input. But not sure.\n\nLet me look at the test input and see if I can find a pattern by applying possible transformations.\n\nTest input:\n\n[0,0,0,0,0,1,1]\n\n[1,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\n[0,1,0,0,0,0,1]\n\nSo the output should be a 3x3. Let's assume the output is formed from rows0,2,4 of the input, taking certain columns.\n\nTest input row0: [0,0,0,0,0,1,1]. If we take columns5 and6, which are1,1. But output is 3 elements.\n\nWait, maybe the output's first row is formed by elements 5,6 from row0. But that's two elements, need three.\n\nAlternatively, elements 3,4,5 from row0:0,0,1 \u2192 [0,0,1]. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the output rows are constructed by taking the first, fourth, and seventh elements of the input's rows0,2,4.\n\nFor the test input:\n\nRow0: elements0=0,3=0,6=1 \u2192 [0,0,1]\n\nRow2: all zeros \u2192 [0,0,0]\n\nRow4: elements0=0,3=0,6=1 \u2192 [0,0,1]\n\nBut the expected output's structure is unknown. But looking at the training examples, each output's elements are non-zero where the input has certain symmetries.\n\nAlternatively, considering the test input:\n\nRow0 has 1s at positions5 and6.\n\nRow1 has a 1 at position0.\n\nRow4 has 1s at positions1 and6.\n\nIf the output is a cross pattern like in Example0, but with 1s, maybe the output's middle row would be [1,1,1], and the middle column has 1s. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, following the pattern from Example4:\n\nIn Example4's input:\n\nRow0: [0,3,0,0,0,3,0]\n\nRow1: [3,0,0,0,0,0,3]\n\nRow4: [0,0,0,0,0,0,3]\n\nOutput:\n\n[0,3,0]\n\n[3,0,3]\n\n[0,0,3]\n\nWhich seems to take:\n\nOutput row0: row0's elements1 and5 \u2192 3 and3, but output is [0,3,0]. So maybe the middle element is 3, and the ends are 0.\n\nHmm, perhaps the output is the maximum of the corresponding positions in the input's rows and columns. For example, output cell (i,j) is the maximum of input's row i*2 and column j*2+1.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is formed by the following steps:\n\n1. Take rows0, 2, and4 from the input.\n\n2. For each of these rows, take elements1,3, and5.\n\nSo for Example0's row0: elements1=8,3=0,5=8 \u2192 [8,0,8]. But the output row0 is [0,8,0]. Doesn't fit. Unless there's a different selection.\n\nWait, maybe elements0,3,6 from rows0,2,4.\n\nExample0's row0:0,0,0 \u2192 [0,0,0] but output row0 is [0,8,0]. Not matching.\n\nAlternatively, elements1,3,5 from rows0,2,4.\n\nExample0 row0:8,0,8 \u2192 [8,0,8]. Output row0 is [0,8,0]. Not matching.\n\nBut wait, maybe the output is a rotation or reflection. For example, the row becomes reversed. So [8,0,8] becomes [8,0,8] reversed \u2192 [8,0,8]. Still not matching the output's [0,8,0].\n\nThis is getting me nowhere. Let me look for another pattern.\n\nLooking at the number of non-zero elements in input and output:\n\nExample0's input has 8 non-zero 8s. Output has 5 non-zero 8s.\n\nExample1's input has several 2s. Output has 7 non-zero 2s.\n\nExample3's input has four 4s in row0 and three in row4. Output has 3 in row0, 0 in row1, 3 in row2.\n\nNot sure.\n\nWait, another idea: the output is a 3x3 grid where each cell (i,j) corresponds to the input's cell (i, j*2). For example:\n\nIn Example0's input:\n\nRow0, columns0,2,4: 0,0,0 \u2192 [0,0,0], but output row0 is [0,8,0]. Not matching.\n\nAlternatively, cell (i,j) in output corresponds to input's cell (i*2, j*2 +1). For output cell (0,0): input row0, column1 \u21928. Which matches output (0,1) is8. Hmm, perhaps this is the case.\n\nLet's see for Example0:\n\noutput cell (0,0) \u2192 input row0*2=0, column0*2+1=1 \u2192 value8. So output cell (0,0) would be8, but the actual output is0. Doesn't fit.\n\nWait, maybe output cell (i,j) is input's cell (i*2, j*2). For Example0:\n\ncell (0,0) \u2192 input row0, column0 \u21920. Output is0. Correct.\n\ncell (0,1) \u2192 input row0, column2 \u21920. Output is8. Doesn't match.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternatively, output cell (i,j) is input's cell (i, j*2 +1). Let's see for Example0's output row0:\n\nj=0 \u2192 column1 \u21928 (input row0, column1)\n\nj=1 \u2192 column3 \u21920\n\nj=2 \u2192 column5 \u21928\n\nSo output row0 would be [8,0,8], but actual output is [0,8,0]. So doesn't fit.\n\nBut wait, maybe the output is shifted. For Example0's output row0: [0,8,0]. If the middle element is from input row0, column3 (0), but it's8 in the output. So this approach isn't working.\n\nAnother angle: in each example, the output's middle row is formed by the first, middle, and last elements of the input's middle row. For Example0, input's middle row is all zeros, output's middle row is [8,8,8]. So that's not it.\n\nPerhaps the output is a result of some XOR-like pattern. Or perhaps the output is created by overlaying certain rows and columns. \n\nAlternatively, maybe each row in the output is formed by taking the first non-zero element from the corresponding input row, then the middle non-zero, then the last. But in Example0's input row0, first non-zero is8 (position1), middle is8 (position5), so output row0 would be [8,8], but it's [0,8,0]. Doesn't fit.\n\nWait, looking at Example3's output row0: [4,0,4]. The input row0 has 4s at positions0 and6. Output row0 is first, middle, last of input row0:4,0,4. Which matches. And output row2 is first, middle, last of input row4:4,0,4. But the output row2 is [4,4,4]. So why the discrepancy?\n\nAh, because in Example3's input row4: [4,0,0,0,0,4,4]. The first element is4, middle (position3) is0, last is4. So output row2 should be [4,0,4], but the actual output is [4,4,4]. So this contradicts.\n\nBut wait, the output row2 is [4,4,4]. Input row4's elements are4 at positions0,5,6. So if we take the first, fifth, and sixth elements:4,4,4. But how would that relate to the output columns?\n\nThe output is 3 columns. Maybe columns are formed by certain positions. For example, output column0 is input's column0, column1 is input's column5, and column2 is input's column6.\n\nFor Example3's row4: input column0=4, column5=4, column6=4 \u2192 [4,4,4]. Which matches output row2.\n\nFor input row0: columns0=4,5=0,6=4 \u2192 [4,0,4]. Which matches output row0.\n\nFor row2 (all zeros): [0,0,0]. Which matches output row1.\n\nSo perhaps the output is constructed by taking input rows0,2,4 and for each, columns0,5,6.\n\nLet's test this with other examples.\n\nExample0's input rows0,2,4:\n\nRow0: columns0=0,5=8,6=0 \u2192 [0,8,0]. Which matches output row0.\n\nRow2: all zeros \u2192 [0,0,0]. But output row1 is [8,8,8]. So this doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. So this works for Example3 but not for Example0. So maybe the pattern isn't consistent.\n\nAnother idea: for each output row, take the first element from the first non-zero element in the input row, the middle element from the middle of the input row, and the last element from the last non-zero element.\n\nBut this is vague.\n\nLooking at the test input:\n\nRows0,2,4:\n\nRow0: [0,0,0,0,0,1,1] \u2192 columns0=0,5=1,6=1 \u2192 [0,1,1]\n\nRow2: all zeros \u2192 [0,0,0]\n\nRow4: [0,1,0,0,0,0,1] \u2192 columns0=0,5=0,6=1 \u2192 [0,0,1]\n\nIf the output is rows0,2,4 with columns0,5,6, the output would be:\n\n[0,1,1]\n\n[0,0,0]\n\n[0,0,1]\n\nBut looking at the training examples, Example1's input row0 is [2,2,0,0,0,2,2]. Columns0=2,5=2,6=2 \u2192 [2,2,2], which matches output row0. Example1's output row0 is [2,2,2]. So this works. Example1's row4 is [2,0,0,0,0,0,2] \u2192 columns0=2,5=0,6=2 \u2192 [2,0,2], which matches output row2. Example1's output row2 is [2,0,2]. So this fits. The middle row of the output would be row2 of input, columns0,5,6 \u2192 all zeros. Which matches output row1 [0,2,2]. Wait, no. Because input row2 is all zeros, so columns0,5,6 are 0,0,0, but output row1 is [0,2,2]. So this doesn't fit. So this pattern works for some rows but not all.\n\nWait, maybe the middle row of the output is taking input row1's columns0,5,6. For Example1:\n\nRow1: [0,0,0,0,0,0,2] \u2192 columns0=0,5=0,6=2 \u2192 [0,0,2]. But output row1 is [0,2,2]. Doesn't fit.\n\nBut Example1's output row1 is [0,2,2]. Where does the 2,2 come from? Input row3 is [0,2,0,0,0,2,0]. Columns0=0,5=2,6=0 \u2192 [0,2,0]. Not matching.\n\nHmm. This is confusing.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output's rows are the input's rows0, 3,4. For Example1:\n\nRow0: [2,2,0,0,0,2,2] \u2192 [2,2,2]\n\nRow3: [0,2,0,0,0,2,0] \u2192 columns0,5,6:0,2,0 \u2192 [0,2,0]\n\nRow4: [2,0,0,0,0,0,2] \u2192 [2,0,2]\n\nBut the output is [2,2,2], [0,2,2], [2,0,2]. So row1 of output is [0,2,2], which doesn't match row3's [0,2,0].\n\nThis is getting too time-consuming. Let me try to find another approach.\n\nLooking at Example1's output:\n\n[2,2,2]\n\n[0,2,2]\n\n[2,0,2]\n\nInput rows0,2,4:\n\nRow0: [2,2,0,0,0,2,2] \u2192 columns0,5,6:2,2,2 \u2192 matches output row0.\n\nRow2: all zeros \u2192 [0,0,0]\n\nRow4: [2,0,0,0,0,0,2] \u2192 columns0,5,6:2,0,2 \u2192 matches output row2.\n\nBut output row1 is [0,2,2]. Where does this come from? Maybe it's row1 of the input. Input row1: [0,0,0,0,0,0,2] \u2192 columns0,5,6:0,0,2 \u2192 [0,0,2]. Doesn't match. Alternatively, row3: [0,2,0,0,0,2,0] \u2192 columns0,5,6:0,2,0 \u2192 [0,2,0]. Still not matching output row1.\n\nHmm. Maybe the output's middle row is a combination of input rows1 and3. For Example1, row1 and row3:\n\nRow1's columns0,5,6:0,0,2\n\nRow3's columns0,5,6:0,2,0\n\nCombining them by taking the maximum: [0,2,2]. Which matches the output row1 [0,2,2].\n\nSimilarly, for Example0's output row1 [8,8,8], perhaps it's the max of input rows1 and3's columns0,5,6. For row1 and3 in Example0:\n\nRow1: [8,8,0,0,0,8,8] \u2192 columns0,5,6:8,8,8 \u2192 max is8.\n\nRow3: same as row1. So max is8, leading to [8,8,8]. Which matches.\n\nThis seems to fit. So the pattern could be:\n\n- The output is a 3x3 grid where:\n\n   - The first row is columns0,5,6 of input row0.\n\n   - The middle row is the maximum (or sum) of columns0,5,6 of input rows1 and3.\n\n   - The last row is columns0,5,6 of input row4.\n\nBut in Example1's output row1, the middle row is [0,2,2]. Input rows1 and3:\n\nRow1: columns0,5,6:0,0,2 \u2192 [0,0,2]\n\nRow3: columns0,5,6:0,2,0 \u2192 [0,2,0]\n\nTaking the maximum of each corresponding element: max(0,0)=0, max(0,2)=2, max(2,0)=2 \u2192 [0,2,2]. Which matches.\n\nExample0's row1 and3:\n\n columns0,5,6:8,8,8. So max is8,8,8 \u2192 matches output row1.\n\nExample3's input:\n\nRow0: columns0,5,6:4,0,4 \u2192 [4,0,4] matches output row0.\n\nRow1: all zeros.\n\nRow3: all zeros.\n\nRow4: columns0,5,6:4,4,4 \u2192 [4,4,4] matches output row2.\n\nSo for the middle row (output row1), it would be the max of rows1 and3's columns0,5,6. Both rows are zeros, so [0,0,0]. Which matches Example3's output row1.\n\nExample2's output:\n\n[4,4,0]\n\n[0,4,4]\n\n[4,0,4]\n\nInput row0: columns0,5,6:4,4,0 \u2192 [4,4,0] matches output row0.\n\nInput rows1 and3: rows1 and3.\n\nRow1: columns0,5,6:0,4,4 \u2192 [0,4,4]\n\nRow3: columns0,5,6:0,0,0 \u2192 [0,0,0]\n\nTaking the max of each element: max(0,0)=0, max(4,0)=4, max(4,0)=4 \u2192 [0,4,4]. Which matches output row1.\n\nRow4: columns0,5,6:4,0,4 \u2192 [4,0,4] matches output row2.\n\nThis seems to fit all examples. So the pattern is:\n\n- The output is a 3x3 matrix.\n\n- The first row is the first, fifth, and sixth elements of the input's first row (0-based).\n\n- The third row is the first, fifth, and sixth elements of the input's fifth row (row4).\n\n- The middle row (row1) is the element-wise maximum between the first, fifth, and sixth elements of input's row1 and row3.\n\nNow, applying this to the test input:\n\nTest input:\n\nRow0: [0,0,0,0,0,1,1] \u2192 columns0=0,5=1,6=1 \u2192 [0,1,1]\n\nRow4: [0,1,0,0,0,0,1] \u2192 columns0=0,5=0,6=1 \u2192 [0,0,1]\n\nRows1 and3:\n\nRow1: [1,0,0,0,0,0,0] \u2192 columns0=1,5=0,6=0 \u2192 [1,0,0]\n\nRow3: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0] \u2192 columns0=0,5=0,6=0 \u2192 [0,0,0]\n\nMax between row1 and row3 for each element:\n\nmax(1,0)=1, max(0,0)=0, max(0,0)=0 \u2192 [1,0,0]\n\nSo the output would be:\n\nRow0: [0,1,1]\n\nRow1: [1,0,0]\n\nRow2: [0,0,1]\n\nBut let's check the training examples' format. Example1's output row1 is [0,2,2], which is derived from the max of row1 and row3. So according to this pattern, the test input's output would be:\n\n[0,1,1]\n\n[1,0,0]\n\n[0,0,1]\n\nBut looking at the training examples, the outputs are formatted with brackets and each row is on a new line. So the final answer should be in that format.",

        "cot_2": "Okay, let's tackle this puzzle. So, I need to figure out the pattern that transforms the input matrices into the output matrices based on the training examples. Let me look through each example step by step.\n\nStarting with Example 0. The input is a 5x7 matrix, and the output is a 3x3 matrix. Let me compare them. The input has rows like [0,8,0,0,0,8,0], and the output is [0,8,0], [8,8,8], [0,8,0]. Hmm, maybe the middle three elements of each row? But looking at the first input row, the middle three would be 0,0,0, but the output starts with 0,8,0. Wait, maybe it's taking columns from the input. Let's see.\n\nThe output for Example 0 is three rows of three elements each. Let's check if each row of the output comes from the corresponding row in the input. For example, the first input row is [0,8,0,0,0,8,0]. The output's first row is [0,8,0]. If I take the first, fourth, and seventh elements: 0,0,0. No, that doesn't fit. Alternatively, maybe it's the first, third, and fifth elements? Wait, the input rows are length 7. Let me think. The output has three elements per row. Maybe they're combining certain columns from the input's rows.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking elements from the first, third, and fifth rows of the input, and then certain columns. Wait, the input has 5 rows, the output has 3. Let me check the rows:\n\nExample0 Input has 5 rows. Output has 3 rows. So maybe rows 0, 2, 4 from the input? Let's see. Input row 0: [0,8,0,0,0,8,0]. Output row 0 is [0,8,0]. Hmm. The input row 0 has 0,8,0 at positions 0,1,2? No, because the output is three elements. Wait, maybe the output rows are constructed by taking the first, middle, and last elements of each input row? Let's check.\n\nFor the first input row of Example0: [0,8,0,0,0,8,0]. The middle element is the fourth one (0-based index 3) which is 0. So taking first, middle, last would be 0,0,0. But the output's first row is [0,8,0]. Hmm, that doesn't match. Maybe the middle three columns of each row? For a 7-column row, the middle three would be indices 2,3,4. So for input row 0: 0,0,0. But output row 0 is [0,8,0]. Not matching.\n\nWait, maybe it's combining elements from different rows. Let me look at the output structure. Example0's output is a diamond shape with 8s. The input has a sort of diamond as well, but larger. The output is a 3x3, maybe a compressed version. Let me try to see how each element in the output is derived from the input.\n\nLooking at Example0's output first row [0,8,0]. The input's first row is [0,8,0,0,0,8,0]. The output's first row could be the first, third, and fifth elements of the input's first row. Wait, first element is 0, third is 0, fifth is 0. No, that gives [0,0,0], which isn't the case. Alternatively, maybe the first, fourth, and seventh elements. 0,0,0. No. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking the non-zero elements from the center of the input. Wait, Example0's output has 8s in a cross shape. The input's middle row is all zeros. The other rows have 8s. Maybe the output is combining the non-zero elements from the top, middle, and bottom rows. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is constructed by taking elements from specific positions. Let's index the input rows and columns. Let's say the input is 5 rows (0-4) and 7 columns (0-6). The output is 3 rows (0-2) and 3 columns (0-2). Let's see:\n\nFor Example0's output [0,8,0] in row 0. Where does this come from? The input row 0 has 8 at position 1 and 5. The output's row 0 has 8 in the middle. Maybe the output's (0,1) is the input's (0,1). But then the output's (0,0) is 0, which is input's (0,0). The output's (0,2) is 0, input's (0,6) is 0. So that could be the first, middle, and last elements of input's row 0? Wait, input row 0 has 7 elements. Middle would be position 3 (0-based). So first (0), middle (0), last (0). But output's first row is [0,8,0], which doesn't match. So that can't be.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is formed by taking the first three rows of the input and then some columns. Wait, but input has 5 rows. Let me check the other examples.\n\nTake Example1. Input is 5 rows, 7 columns. Output is 3x3. Let's look at the output:\n\n[2,2,2],\n[0,2,2],\n[2,0,2]\n\nLooking at the input for Example1:\n\nFirst input row: [2,2,0,0,0,2,2]. Output's first row is [2,2,2]. So maybe taking the first, third, fifth elements? From input row 0: 2,0,0 \u2192 no. Alternatively, input row 0's first three elements: 2,2,0. Not matching output's 2,2,2.\n\nWait, the output's first row is all 2s. The input's first row has 2s at positions 0,1,5,6. How to get three 2s? Maybe combining elements from different positions. Alternatively, maybe the output is the sum of certain elements? Not sure.\n\nAnother approach: look for the output dimensions. The input is 5x7, output is 3x3. So it's a reduction. Maybe the output is a kind of convolution or combining of certain cells.\n\nLooking at Example0's output again. The output has 8s forming a cross. The input's 8s are arranged in a larger cross. The input's first row has 8 at positions 1 and 5. The second row has 8s at 0,1,5,6. Third row all zeros. Fourth row same as second. Fifth row same as first. The output's cross is formed by the center and the middle row. Maybe the output is taking the center parts of the input's cross.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is constructed by taking the middle three rows and middle three columns of the input. But the input has 5 rows. Middle three rows would be 1,2,3. Middle three columns of 7 columns are 2,3,4. But for Example0's input, taking rows 1,2,3 and columns 2,3,4:\n\nRow1: [8,8,0,0,0,8,8] \u2192 columns 2,3,4 are 0,0,0. But output's second row is [8,8,8]. So that doesn't fit. So maybe not that.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps each cell in the output is derived from three cells in the input. For example, the top-left cell in the output is formed by combining input cells (0,0), (0,3), (4,0). Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is built by looking at specific positions in the input matrix. Let's see:\n\nFor Example0's output:\n\nRow 0: [0,8,0]. Maybe these correspond to input's row 0, column 1 (8), input row 0 column 5 (8), but how to get the three elements? Maybe the output's rows are formed by the first, middle, and last rows of the input, and the columns are first, middle, last. Let's check:\n\nFor Example0:\n\nInput rows 0,2,4 (since output has 3 rows). For each of these rows, take columns 0,3,6 (since those are the first, middle, and last in 7 columns).\n\nRow0: columns 0,3,6 \u2192 0,0,0 \u2192 which would be output row0, but the actual output is [0,8,0]. So that's not matching. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe the columns taken are 1,3,5. For row0: columns 1 (8),3 (0),5 (8). So 8,0,8. But output row0 is [0,8,0]. Doesn't fit. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, columns 0, 3, 6 for each of the first, middle, last rows. For Example0's row0 (input row0): 0,0,0 \u2192 output row0 is [0,8,0]. So that's not matching.\n\nLet me check Example3. Input is:\n\n[4,0,0,0,0,0,4]\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n[4,0,0,0,0,4,4]\n\nOutput is:\n\n[4,0,4]\n[0,0,0]\n[4,4,4]\n\nLooking at output row0: 4,0,4. The input row0 starts and ends with 4. So maybe taking first and last elements of row0, and the middle? Input row0's middle (column3) is 0. So 4,0,4. That fits. Output row0 matches. Then output row2 is [4,4,4]. Input's last row (row4) has elements 4,0,0,0,0,4,4. If we take first, middle, last: 4 (col0), 0 (col3), 4 (col6). But output row2 is 4,4,4. So that doesn't fit. Wait, but input row4 has 4s at col0,5,6. So maybe in output row2, the elements are input row4's col0, col5, col6. Which are 4,4,4. So yes. So output row2 is [4,4,4].\n\nSimilarly, output row1 is all zeros. Which comes from input row2 (middle row) which is all zeros. So maybe for output row1, we take input row2's first, middle, last elements. Which are 0,0,0. That matches.\n\nSo maybe the pattern is: for the output's three rows, take the first, middle (third), and last elements of the input's first, middle (third), and last rows.\n\nWait, let's check this with Example3:\n\nOutput rows:\n\nRow0: input's row0, columns0,3,6 \u2192 4,0,4 \u2192 matches [4,0,4].\n\nRow1: input's row2 (middle of 5 rows), columns0,3,6 \u2192 0,0,0 \u2192 matches [0,0,0].\n\nRow2: input's row4 (last row), columns0,3,6 \u2192 4,0,4. But the output's row2 is [4,4,4]. So this doesn't fit. Wait, in the input's row4, the elements are [4,0,0,0,0,4,4]. So columns0,3,6 are 4,0,4. But output's row2 is [4,4,4]. So that's a discrepancy.\n\nHmm, maybe columns0,5,6? For row4, that would be 4,4,4. Which matches the output row2. So in that case, the columns to take are 0,5,6. But why would that be the case? How to generalize.\n\nWait, let's check other examples. Let's take Example0's input:\n\nRow0: [0,8,0,0,0,8,0]. Output row0 is [0,8,0]. If columns are 0,1,6 \u2192 0,8,0. That matches. Then row1 of output is [8,8,8]. Which comes from input row1 (second row). Input row1 is [8,8,0,0,0,8,8]. If columns are 0,3,6 \u2192 8,0,8. But output row1 is [8,8,8]. So that's not matching. Alternatively, columns0,1,5,6? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output for each row is taking the first non-zero element, the middle element, and the last non-zero element? Not sure.\n\nAnother approach: looking at the output of each example and see how they relate to the input.\n\nTake Example4:\n\nInput:\n\n[0,3,0,0,0,3,0]\n[3,0,0,0,0,0,3]\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,3]\n\nOutput:\n\n[0,3,0]\n[3,0,3]\n[0,0,3]\n\nOutput row0: 0,3,0. Input row0 has 3s at positions1 and5. So maybe taking elements 1,3,5? 3,0,3. But output is 0,3,0. Hmm, not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is taking certain elements from the input's rows and columns based on some symmetry. For instance, maybe the output is a 3x3 grid where each cell is taken from the input's corresponding positions when folded.\n\nWait, let's imagine that the input is a 5x7 matrix, which is symmetric in some way. Maybe the output is taking elements from the corners and center.\n\nAlternatively, let's think of the input as a larger grid, and the output is a smaller grid that captures the essential parts. For example, in Example0, the input has 8s forming a diamond shape. The output is a smaller diamond. So maybe each output cell is the sum or presence of 8s in certain positions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by combining the first, third, and fifth rows of the input, and taking the first, third, and fifth columns. But input has 5 rows and 7 columns. Let's check.\n\nFor Example0's input, rows 0,2,4:\n\nRow0: [0,8,0,0,0,8,0]\n\nRow2: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow4: [0,8,0,0,0,8,0]\n\nTaking columns 0,3,6 from these rows:\n\nRow0: 0,0,0 \u2192 output row0 is [0,8,0], which doesn't match.\n\nHmm. Not helpful.\n\nAnother idea: The output seems to sometimes include elements from different rows. For Example0's output row1 is [8,8,8]. The input's row1 has 8s in positions0,1,5,6. So if output row1 is combining those, perhaps taking 0,5,6? 8,8,8. That would fit. So output row1 is input row1's 0,5,6 elements. Then output row0: input row0's 0,1,6 \u2192 0,8,0. Output row2: input row4's 0,5,6 \u2192 0,8,0. But that would give:\n\nRow0: 0,8,0\n\nRow1:8,8,8\n\nRow2:0,8,0\n\nWhich matches Example0's output. Oh! So maybe the pattern is:\n\nFor each of the output's three rows (i), take the first, second, and sixth elements of the input's row (i*2). Because input has 5 rows (indices 0-4), so 0,2,4 would be the rows for output rows 0,1,2. Wait, but in Example0, the output rows 0,1,2 correspond to input rows 0,1,4. Wait, because output row1 is from input row1.\n\nWait, in Example0:\n\nOutput row0: input row0 \u2192 [0,8,0,0,0,8,0]. Take elements 0,1,6 \u2192 0,8,0 \u2192 matches.\n\nOutput row1: input row1 \u2192 [8,8,0,0,0,8,8]. Take elements 0,5,6 \u2192 8,8,8 \u2192 matches.\n\nOutput row2: input row4 \u2192 [0,8,0,0,0,8,0]. Take elements 0,1,6 \u2192 0,8,0 \u2192 matches.\n\nBut that seems to vary. Let's check another example.\n\nTake Example1's output:\n\n[2,2,2]\n\n[0,2,2]\n\n[2,0,2]\n\nInput for Example1:\n\nRow0: [2,2,0,0,0,2,2]\n\nRow1: [0,0,0,0,0,0,2]\n\nRow2: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow3: [0,2,0,0,0,2,0]\n\nRow4: [2,0,0,0,0,0,2]\n\nIf we apply the same pattern:\n\nOutput row0: input row0's elements 0,1,6 \u2192 2,2,2 \u2192 which matches the first output row [2,2,2].\n\nOutput row1: input row1's elements 0,5,6 \u2192 0,0,2 \u2192 but the output's row1 is [0,2,2]. Hmm, that doesn't match. So maybe that's not the pattern.\n\nWait, maybe the columns are different. For Example0's row1, columns 0,5,6. For Example1's row1, columns0,5,6 would be 0 (col0),0 (col5),2 (col6). So [0,0,2], but output's row1 is [0,2,2]. Doesn't match.\n\nAlternative approach: For each output row i, the elements are taken from input row i*2 (since input has 5 rows, output 3 rows). But for Example0, that would be input rows 0, 2, 4. But Example0's output row1 is from input row1. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output rows are formed from input rows 0, 2, 4. Let's check Example1:\n\nOutput rows:\n\nRow0: [2,2,2] \u2192 from input row0's elements. Input row0 is [2,2,0,0,0,2,2]. If we take elements0,3,6: 2,0,2 \u2192 no. Or elements0,1,6: 2,2,2 \u2192 yes. So if row0 of output is elements0,1,6 of input row0.\n\nRow1: input row2 (all zeros). Taking elements0,3,6: 0,0,0. But output row1 is [0,2,2]. So that doesn't match.\n\nHmm. So this approach works for row0 but not row1. So maybe the pattern isn't consistent across examples.\n\nLet's look at Example3's input and output:\n\nInput rows:\n\nRow0: [4,0,0,0,0,0,4]\n\nRow4: [4,0,0,0,0,4,4]\n\nOutput row0: [4,0,4] \u2192 input row0's elements0,6 \u2192 but there's three elements. So maybe 0,3,6 \u2192 4,0,4. That fits.\n\nOutput row2: [4,4,4] \u2192 input row4's elements0,5,6 \u2192 4,4,4. Which matches.\n\nOutput row1: [0,0,0] \u2192 input row2's elements0,3,6 \u2192 0,0,0.\n\nSo for Example3, the pattern is taking elements0,3,6 from input rows0,2,4.\n\nIf that's the case, then for Example0:\n\nRow0: elements0,3,6 \u2192 0,0,0 \u2192 but output row0 is [0,8,0]. So that doesn't fit. So maybe not.\n\nWait, Example0's output row0 is [0,8,0]. If elements are taken from columns1,3,5:\n\nRow0: 8 (col1), 0 (col3), 8 (col5). So [8,0,8]. No, output is [0,8,0]. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, columns1,5,1 \u2192 no.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is taking the middle three columns of the input matrix when centered. For 7 columns, the middle three are columns 2,3,4. But for Example0's input row0: [0,8,0,0,0,8,0], columns2,3,4 are 0,0,0. Output row0 is [0,8,0]. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is a compressed version where each element is the maximum of certain cells. For Example0's output row0, middle element 8 could be the maximum of input row0's elements. But the input row0 has 8s. So maybe max of row0's elements, but that would be 8 for all elements, which is not the case.\n\nHmm, this is tricky. Let's look for another pattern.\n\nAnother observation: in the training examples, the output matrices often have a certain symmetry. For example, Example0's output is a cross. Example1's output has 2s arranged in a way that the first row is all 2s, and the third row has 2s at the corners and middle. Example3's output has 4s in the first and third rows. Maybe the pattern involves some kind of overlap or merging of elements from the input's top, middle, and bottom rows.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is formed by combining the first row's first three elements, the middle row's middle three elements, and the last row's last three elements. Let's see.\n\nFor Example0:\n\nFirst row's first three: [0,8,0]. Middle row (row2) is all zeros. Last row's last three elements: [8,0,0]. No, that doesn't form the output.\n\nAlternatively, the output is the first three elements of the first row, last three elements of the last row, and the middle row's middle three. Doesn't fit.\n\nAnother idea: the output is formed by taking the first, fourth, and seventh elements of each of the first, third, and fifth rows. For Example0:\n\nFirst row (row0): elements0,3,6 \u2192 0,0,0 \u2192 output row0 is [0,8,0]. Doesn't fit.\n\nHmm.\n\nLet's try to think of each output cell as a combination of three input cells. For example, the output's [i][j] is the sum (or logical OR) of input's [i*2][j*2], [i*2][j*2 +1], etc. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the output could be the central part of the input after some transformation. For example, removing the outer layers. The input is 5x7. Removing one layer from top, bottom, left, and right would leave a 3x3. Let's see:\n\nFor Example0's input, the center 3x3 would be rows1-3 and columns2-4:\n\nRow1: [8,8,0,0,0,8,8] \u2192 columns2-4: 0,0,0 \u2192 output row1 in Example0 is [8,8,8], which doesn't match. So that's not it.\n\nAnother approach: looking for how the numbers transfer. For Example0, the input has 8s in a pattern that the output also has 8s in a smaller pattern. So maybe the output is the sum or presence of 8s in certain positions.\n\nAlternatively, the output is created by taking the non-zero elements from the input's first, third, and fifth rows. But Example0's output row0 has a 8 which is from row0's second element.\n\nAlternatively, the output is formed by taking the first non-zero element from the first row, the middle non-zero element from the middle row, and the last non-zero element from the last row. Not sure.\n\nLet me think differently. Maybe the output is formed by looking for the non-zero elements in specific positions. For Example0, the output is a cross of 8s. The input's first row has two 8s, the second row has four 8s, etc. So perhaps the output's cross is formed by taking the 8s that are at the edges of the input's cross.\n\nAlternatively, the output could be the intersection of certain diagonals. For Example0, the input has 8s forming a diamond. The output is a smaller diamond. Maybe the output's diamond is formed by the innermost 3x3 part of the input's diamond.\n\nBut in Example0's input, the middle row is all zeros, so that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is a 3x3 matrix where each cell (i,j) is taken from the input cell (i*2, j*2 + offset). For example, for a 3x3 output, i and j go from 0 to 2. Then input rows would be 0, 2, 4 (for i=0,1,2). Columns would be 0, 2, 4 (for j=0,1,2). But let's check:\n\nExample0's input:\n\nRow0, columns0,2,4: 0,0,0 \u2192 output row0 is [0,8,0]. Doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. Not working.\n\nAnother observation: in Example1, the output's third row is [2,0,2]. The input's last row is [2,0,0,0,0,0,2]. Taking elements0,3,6: 2,0,2. Which matches. So maybe for the last row of output, take elements0,3,6 of input's last row. For the first row of output, take elements0,3,6 of input's first row. Middle row of output is elements0,3,6 of input's middle row. Let's test this.\n\nExample0:\n\nOutput row0: input row0 elements0,3,6 \u2192 0,0,0 \u2192 but output is [0,8,0]. Doesn't fit.\n\nExample1:\n\nOutput row0: input row0 elements0,3,6 \u2192 2,0,2. But output row0 is [2,2,2]. Doesn't fit. So that's not the pattern.\n\nBut wait, for Example3's output row0 is [4,0,4], which matches input row0's elements0,3,6 (4,0,4). Output row2 is [4,4,4], which matches input row4's elements0,5,6 (4,4,4). Oh, so in Example3, the columns for the last row are different. For row4, elements0,5,6: 4,4,4. So maybe the columns vary depending on the row.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Let's try to find a pattern that works across all examples.\n\nLooking at Example1's output:\n\n[2,2,2]\n\n[0,2,2]\n\n[2,0,2]\n\nInput rows:\n\nRow0: [2,2,0,0,0,2,2]\n\nRow1: [0,0,0,0,0,0,2]\n\nRow4: [2,0,0,0,0,0,2]\n\nOutput row0: [2,2,2] \u2192 could be input row0's elements0,1,5 (2,2,2). \n\nOutput row1: [0,2,2] \u2192 input row1's elements5,6 (0,2) \u2192 but need three elements. Maybe elements0,5,6: 0,0,2 \u2192 which would be [0,0,2], but output is [0,2,2]. Doesn't fit.\n\nOutput row2: [2,0,2] \u2192 input row4's elements0,3,6: 2,0,2 \u2192 matches.\n\nSo for Example1's output:\n\nRow0: elements0,1,5 of input row0 \u2192 2,2,2.\n\nRow1: ?\n\nRow2: elements0,3,6 of input row4 \u2192 2,0,2.\n\nBut row1 of output is [0,2,2]. Input row1 is [0,0,0,0,0,0,2]. If we take elements5,6: 0,2. But output row1 has three elements. Maybe elements3,5,6: 0,0,2 \u2192 [0,0,2], not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe output row1 is elements0,5,6 of input row1 \u2192 0,0,2 \u2192 [0,0,2]. Still not matching.\n\nHmm.\n\nLet me check Example2:\n\nInput:\n\n[4,4,0,0,0,4,0]\n\n[0,0,0,0,0,4,4]\n\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\n[4,0,0,0,0,0,4]\n\nOutput:\n\n[4,4,0]\n\n[0,4,4]\n\n[4,0,4]\n\nOutput row0: [4,4,0]. Input row0 is [4,4,0,0,0,4,0]. If we take elements0,1,5 \u21924,4,4. But output is [4,4,0]. Not matching.\n\nAlternatively, elements0,1,6 \u21924,4,0. Which matches output row0.\n\nRow1: [0,4,4]. Input row1 is [0,0,0,0,0,4,4]. Taking elements5,6 \u21924,4. But we need three elements. So elements4,5,6:0,4,4 \u2192 which would be [0,4,4]. But the input row1's element4 is 0.\n\nOutput row1: [0,4,4]. So input row1 elements4,5,6 \u21920,4,4 \u2192 matches.\n\nOutput row2: [4,0,4]. Input row4 is [4,0,0,0,0,0,4]. Taking elements0,3,6 \u21924,0,4 \u2192 matches.\n\nSo for Example2, the pattern seems to be:\n\nRow0 of output: elements0,1,6 of input row0.\n\nRow1: elements4,5,6 of input row1.\n\nRow2: elements0,3,6 of input row4.\n\nThis works for Example2. Let's check if this applies to other examples.\n\nExample3:\n\nInput rows0: [4,0,0,0,0,0,4]\n\nRow0 elements0,1,6:4,0,4 \u2192 output row0 is [4,0,4], which matches.\n\nRow1 of output is [0,0,0]. Input row1 is all zeros. So elements4,5,6 of row1 (which is row1: all zeros) would be [0,0,0].\n\nRow2 of output is [4,4,4]. Input row4 is [4,0,0,0,0,4,4]. Taking elements0,3,6 \u21924,0,4. Doesn't match. But output row2 is [4,4,4]. So this pattern doesn't fit here.\n\nHmm. In Example3's output row2 is [4,4,4]. Input row4's elements0,5,6 \u21924,4,4. So maybe for row2, take elements0,5,6 of input row4.\n\nSo in Example3:\n\nRow0: elements0,1,6 \u21924,0,4.\n\nRow1: elements4,5,6 of input row1 \u21920,0,0.\n\nRow2: elements0,5,6 of input row4 \u21924,4,4.\n\nThat works. Let's see if this pattern holds for other examples.\n\nExample0:\n\nRow0: elements0,1,6 of input row0 \u21920,8,0 \u2192 matches output row0.\n\nRow1: elements4,5,6 of input row1 \u21920,8,8 \u2192 but output row1 is [8,8,8]. So this would give [0,8,8], which doesn't match.\n\nHmm. So the pattern varies between examples, which complicates things. Maybe the columns selected depend on the specific input.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the columns are chosen based on the positions of non-zero elements in the input rows.\n\nFor example, in Example0's row1: [8,8,0,0,0,8,8]. The non-zero elements are at positions0,1,5,6. The output row1 is [8,8,8]. So maybe taking the first three non-zero elements. But there are four non-zero elements. Alternatively, taking the first, middle, and last non-zero elements. For row1, non-zero elements are 0,1,5,6. Middle would be between 1 and5. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, take the first, third, and fifth columns. But that may not fit.\n\nThis is getting too time-consuming. Let me try to find a general rule that fits all examples.\n\nAnother approach: For each output row i, the output row is formed by taking three consecutive elements from the input's row (i*2), but shifted in some way. For example:\n\n- Output row0: input row0, columns1-3 (assuming 0-based)\n- Output row1: input row1, columns0-2\n- Output row2: input row4, columns5-7 (but indices go up to6)\n\nBut in Example0's input row0 columns1-3 are [8,0,0], which doesn't match output row0 [0,8,0].\n\nHmm.\n\nWait, looking back at Example0's output:\n\nThe output is a 3x3 cross. The input is a larger cross. The output's cross is centered, so maybe the output is the center part of the input's cross. But how?\n\nAlternatively, the output is formed by taking the first element of the first row, the middle element of the middle row, and the last element of the last row. But that would give only three elements, not three rows.\n\nPerhaps the output is constructed by combining the first, middle, and last elements from the first, middle, and last rows of the input.\n\nBut I'm stuck. Let's look for another pattern.\n\nAnother observation: in all the examples, the output's row0 corresponds to the input's row0, row1 corresponds to input's row1, and row2 corresponds to input's row4. For example:\n\nExample0: output has 3 rows, input rows 0,1,4.\n\nExample1: output rows correspond to input rows0,1,4.\n\nExample2: output rows correspond to input rows0,1,4.\n\nExample3: output rows correspond to input rows0,2,4.\n\nExample4: output rows correspond to input rows0,1,4.\n\nSo in most cases, output rows are input's rows0,1,4, but Example3 uses row2 as the middle row. So maybe in some cases, when the middle rows are all zeros, they are skipped.\n\nBut this is not consistent. Example3's input has three middle rows of zeros, so the output's middle row is from input row2 (all zeros), but other examples use input row1.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternatively, the output is formed by the first, second, and fifth rows of the input. But in Example0, that would be rows0,1,4. Which matches the output rows. In Example1, rows0,1,4. Example2: rows0,1,4. Example3: rows0,2,4. Example4: rows0,1,4. So it's mostly rows0,1,4, except Example3 uses row2 instead of row1. But Example3's input row1 is all zeros. So maybe when the second row (row1) is all zeros, the output takes row2 instead. Not sure.\n\nBut how does this help in determining the columns?\n\nAssuming that output rows are rows0,1,4 of the input, then for each of these rows, select certain columns to form the output.\n\nLooking at Example0:\n\nRow0: [0,8,0,0,0,8,0] \u2192 output row0 is [0,8,0].\n\nIf we take columns0,1,6: 0,8,0 \u2192 matches.\n\nRow1: [8,8,0,0,0,8,8] \u2192 output row1 is [8,8,8]. Taking columns0,5,6:8,8,8 \u2192 matches.\n\nRow4: [0,8,0,0,0,8,0] \u2192 columns0,1,6 \u21920,8,0 \u2192 matches output row2.\n\nExample0's output is achieved by taking columns0,1,6 for row0 and row4, and columns0,5,6 for row1.\n\nBut why different columns for different rows?\n\nExample1:\n\nRow0: [2,2,0,0,0,2,2] \u2192 output row0 is [2,2,2]. Taking columns0,5,6 \u21922,2,2.\n\nRow1: [0,0,0,0,0,0,2] \u2192 output row1 is [0,2,2]. Taking columns5,6, something else? Columns5 is 0,6 is 2. So maybe columns0,5,6 \u21920,0,2 \u2192 no. Doesn't fit. Output row1 is [0,2,2].\n\nRow4: [2,0,0,0,0,0,2] \u2192 columns0,5,6 \u21922,0,2 \u2192 matches output row2.\n\nHmm. For row0, columns0,5,6 gives 2,2,2. For row1, columns5,6, and maybe another column. But in row1, columns5 is 0,6 is2. Output row1 is [0,2,2]. So perhaps taking columns0,5,6 for row1:0,0,2 \u2192 no. Or columns4,5,6:0,0,2 \u2192 no. Alternatively, columns3,5,6:0,0,2 \u2192 no.\n\nAlternatively, maybe for row1, take columns0,1,6 \u21920,0,2 \u2192 doesn't match [0,2,2].\n\nThis is confusing. Maybe there's another way to select columns based on certain criteria.\n\nAnother observation: in Example0's output, the three 8s in the middle row correspond to the first, fifth, and sixth elements of input row1. In Example1's output, the middle row has 0,2,2 which could be input row1's fifth and sixth elements (0,2) but that's two elements, need three.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the columns for each output row are determined by the positions of non-zero elements in the corresponding input row.\n\nFor Example0's row1: [8,8,0,0,0,8,8]. Non-zero elements at 0,1,5,6. So take the first three non-zero elements:0,1,5 \u21928,8,8. Which matches output row1.\n\nFor Example1's row1: [0,0,0,0,0,0,2]. Non-zero elements only at6. So maybe pad with zeros. But output row1 is [0,2,2]. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, take the last three non-zero elements. For Example0's row1, last three non-zero elements are1,5,6 \u21928,8,8. But output row1 is [8,8,8], which matches.\n\nFor Example1's row1, the only non-zero element is6. So output row1 would need to take that and pad. But output row1 is [0,2,2]. Doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe take the first and last non-zero elements and the middle element of the row. But this is getting too vague.\n\nLet's try to find a pattern that works across all examples.\n\nLooking at all examples:\n\nThe output rows seem to be formed from the first, second, and fifth input rows (rows0,1,4) except for Example3, which uses rows0,2,4.\n\nBut how to select columns for each row?\n\nAnother approach: For each output row i, the output is formed by taking the first non-zero element, the middle element, and the last non-zero element of the corresponding input row.\n\nFor Example0's row0: first non-zero is at1 (8), middle element (index3) is0, last non-zero is at5 (8). So [8,0,8], but output is [0,8,0]. Doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, take the first, middle, and last elements of the input row. For Example0 row0: 0,0,0 \u2192 no.\n\nHmm.\n\nLet me think of the output as a 3x3 grid where each cell is derived from the input's cell in a specific way. For example, the output cell (i,j) corresponds to the input's cell (i*2, j*2). But let's check:\n\nExample0's output cell (0,0) would be input (0,0) \u21920. (0,1) is input (0,2) \u21920. (0,2) is input (0,4) \u21920. But output row0 is [0,8,0]. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, output cell (i,j) is input's (i, j*2 +1). For Example0's output row0:\n\ni=0, j=0 \u2192 input (0,1)=8\n\nj=1 \u2192 input (0,3)=0\n\nj=2 \u2192 input (0,5)=8\n\nSo [8,0,8]. Output row0 is [0,8,0]. Doesn't match.\n\nThis is really challenging. Let's look at the test input and see if I can find a pattern there.\n\nTest input:\n\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1]\n\n[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n[0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]\n\nThe output should be a 3x3 matrix. Let's try to apply what I've learned from the examples.\n\nAssuming that output rows correspond to input rows0,1,4.\n\nFor each output row:\n\nRow0: input row0 \u2192 [0,0,0,0,0,1,1]\n\nNeed to take three elements. Let's see in the examples, when the input row has non-zero elements at certain positions. For example, in Example3's row0, elements0 and6 are taken. For row0, maybe take elements5 and6 (1,1) and another element. But output needs three elements.\n\nAlternatively, if the pattern is to take the first non-zero, middle, and last non-zero elements:\n\nInput row0 has non-zero elements at5 and6 (1,1). But there are two elements. So perhaps take first non-zero (5), middle (3), and last (6). But middle is zero. So the output row0 would be [1,0,1]. But looking at previous examples, maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, the output for row0 could be [0,1,1], taking elements5,6, and maybe another. But how?\n\nLooking at the training examples, for Example4's input row0: [0,3,0,0,0,3,0], the output row0 is [0,3,0]. The input row0 has non-zero elements at1 and5, but the output takes elements1,3,5? No. Output is [0,3,0], which matches input elements0,1,6:0,3,0. So maybe the pattern is taking elements0,1,6 of the input's row0.\n\nFor the test input's row0: elements0,1,6 \u21920,0,1 \u2192 [0,0,1]. But looking at the examples, in Example0's row0, the output was [0,8,0], which matches elements0,1,6 of input row0 (0,8,0). So this seems possible.\n\nTest input row0: elements0,1,6 \u21920,0,1 \u2192 output row0: [0,0,1]?\n\nBut let's check other examples. For Example1's row0: input row0's elements0,1,6 \u21922,2,2 \u2192 which matches output row0 [2,2,2]. Yes. Example4's row0: input row0's elements0,1,6 \u21920,3,0 \u2192 matches output row0 [0,3,0]. So this pattern holds for these examples.\n\nSo for row0 of the output, take elements0,1,6 of input row0.\n\nFor row1 of the output, let's see.\n\nIn Example0's row1: input row1's elements0,5,6 \u21928,8,8 \u2192 matches output row1 [8,8,8].\n\nExample1's row1: input row1's elements0,5,6 \u21920,0,2 \u2192 but output row1 is [0,2,2]. Doesn't match. Wait, this is inconsistent.\n\nExample4's row1: input row1 is [3,0,0,0,0,0,3]. elements0,5,6 \u21923,0,3 \u2192 output row1 is [3,0,3]. Which matches. So why does Example1's row1 not follow this?\n\nExample1's row1 is [0,0,0,0,0,0,2]. elements0,5,6 \u21920,0,2 \u2192 output row1 is [0,2,2]. So this doesn't match. Hmm.\n\nBut wait, maybe for row1, it's elements0,5,6. In Example1's row1, this would be [0,0,2], but output is [0,2,2]. So perhaps there's a mistake in the pattern here. Or maybe there's another rule.\n\nAlternatively, maybe for row1, we take elements0,5,6. In some examples, like Example0, it works. In Example1, it doesn't. What's different? In Example1's row1, element5 is 0. But output row1's middle element is2.\n\nWait, maybe for row1, elements5 and6 are taken as the last two elements of the output row, and element1 is taken as the first. Let's check.\n\nExample1's row1: elements1,5,6 \u21920,0,2 \u2192 [0,0,2]. Output is [0,2,2]. Doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, elements5,6, and something else. Not sure.\n\nLooking at Example1's output row1: [0,2,2]. The input row1's elements are all zeros except element6 (2). So how to get [0,2,2] from that? Maybe taking elements0,5, and6. Which are 0,0,2. But that's [0,0,2]. Not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe elements3,5,6. Input row1 elements3 is0,5 is0,6 is2 \u2192 [0,0,2]. Still not.\n\nHmm. This inconsistency suggests that there's another pattern I'm missing.\n\nAnother idea: the output's row1 is formed by taking elements5,6, and another element from the input's row1. But in Example0's row1, elements5 and6 are 8 and8, plus element0 is8. So [8,8,8]. That works.\n\nExample1's row1: elements5 is0,6 is2. What's the third element? Maybe element4, which is0. But [0,0,2] doesn't match [0,2,2]. Or element2 is0. So [0,0,2]. Doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe row1's elements are the sum of certain columns. Not sure.\n\nLet's try to look at the test input and see what the output should be, based on the pattern observed in the examples.\n\nTest input:\n\nRow0: [0,0,0,0,0,1,1]. Elements0,1,6 \u21920,0,1 \u2192 output row0: [0,0,1].\n\nRow1: [1,0,0,0,0,0,0]. Elements0,5,6 \u21921,0,0 \u2192 output row1: [1,0,0].\n\nRow4: [0,1,0,0,0,0,1]. Elements0,1,6 \u21920,1,1 \u2192 output row2: [0,1,1].\n\nBut this doesn't match the structure of the examples. For instance, Example0's output row1 is [8,8,8], which is all 8s. The test input's row1 would give [1,0,0], which doesn't form a meaningful pattern. But according to the examples, especially Example4, which has similar structure, perhaps the output is formed differently.\n\nExample4's input row0: [0,3,0,0,0,3,0]. Elements0,1,6 \u21920,3,0 \u2192 output row0: [0,3,0].\n\nRow1: [3,0,0,0,0,0,3]. Elements0,5,6 \u21923,0,3 \u2192 output row1: [3,0,3].\n\nRow4: [0,0,0,0,0,0,3]. Elements0,1,6 \u21920,0,3 \u2192 output row2: [0,0,3].\n\nSo for the test input, following this pattern:\n\nRow0: elements0,1,6 \u21920,0,1 \u2192 [0,0,1].\n\nRow1: elements0,5,6 \u21921,0,0 \u2192 [1,0,0].\n\nRow4: elements0,1,6 \u21920,1,1 \u2192 [0,1,1].\n\nBut this output doesn't match the examples' style. For example, Example1's output row1 is [0,2,2], which doesn't follow the elements0,5,6 pattern. So there's inconsistency here.\n\nAnother angle: maybe the output is a 3x3 matrix where each column is taken from different positions. For example, column0 comes from input's column0, column1 from input's column3, and column2 from input's column6.\n\nFor Example0's row0: columns0,3,6 \u21920,0,0. But output row0 is [0,8,0]. Doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, columns1,3,5 for each row. For Example0's row0:8,0,8 \u2192 [8,0,8]. No, output is [0,8,0].\n\nHmm.\n\nAt this point, given the time I've spent and the inconsistency in the patterns, I'll have to make an educated guess based on the examples that worked.\n\nFor the test input:\n\nAssuming that output rows are formed from input rows0,1,4, taking elements0,1,6 for row0 and row4, and elements0,5,6 for row1.\n\nTest input row0: [0,0,0,0,0,1,1]. elements0,1,6 \u21920,0,1 \u2192 output row0: [0,0,1].\n\nRow1: [1,0,0,0,0,0,0]. elements0,5,6 \u21921,0,0 \u2192 output row1: [1,0,0].\n\nRow4: [0,1,0,0,0,0,1]. elements0,1,6 \u21920,1,1 \u2192 output row2: [0,1,1].\n\nBut looking at Example4's output row2 is [0,0,3], which comes from input row4's elements0,1,6 \u21920,0,3. So this pattern holds there.\n\nHowever, the test input's output would be:\n\n[0,0,1]\n\n[1,0,0]\n\n[0,1,1]\n\nBut looking at the examples, the outputs tend to have numbers arranged in a certain way. For instance, Example0's output is a cross. Example1's output has a diagonal. The test input's output as above doesn't seem to form a particular pattern, but maybe that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the test input's output is:\n\n[0,1,1]\n\n[1,0,0]\n\n[0,1,1]\n\nBut I'm not sure. Another possibility is that for row1 of the output, we take elements0,1,6 of input row1. For the test input row1, this would be [1,0,0], which matches the previous guess.\n\nBut let's check Example1's row1 again. Input row1: [0,0,0,0,0,0,2]. elements0,1,6 \u21920,0,2 \u2192 output row1 is [0,2,2]. So this doesn't match. So the pattern isn't consistent.\n\nGiven the time constraints, I'll proceed with the pattern that works for most examples: for output row0, elements0,1,6 of input row0; for row1, elements0,5,6 of input row1; for row2, elements0,1,6 of input row4.\n\nApplying this to the test input:\n\nRow0: [0,0,0,0,0,1,1] \u2192 elements0,1,6 \u21920,0,1 \u2192 [0,0,1].\n\nRow1: [1,0,0,0,0,0,0] \u2192 elements0,5,6 \u21921,0,0 \u2192 [1,0,0].\n\nRow4: [0,1,0,0,0,0,1] \u2192 elements0,1,6 \u21920,1,1 \u2192 [0,1,1].\n\nBut this doesn't match the style of previous examples. For example, Example1's output row1 is [0,2,2], which would require elements5,6, and something else. However, given the time I've spent, I'll go with this pattern and see."
