        "cot_1": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. So, the training examples all start with a grid of zeros, and the output grids have 8s in certain positions and 0s in others. Let me look at each example and see if I can spot a trend.\n\nStarting with Example 0: the input is a 3x3 grid. The output has 8s on the borders except the center which remains 0. Wait, no. The first and last rows are all 8s, and the middle row has 8s on the ends with a 0 in the middle. So like a frame around the center.\n\nExample 1 is a 4x3 grid. The output has the first and last rows all 8s. The middle two rows have 8s on the ends and 0 in the middle. So again, creating a border but since the rows are four, maybe the middle rows (second and third) have the 0 in the middle.\n\nExample 2 is a 5x4 grid. The output's first and last rows are all 8s. The rows in between have 8s on the first and last elements, and 0s in between. So for each row between the top and bottom, the edges are 8 and the inner elements are 0. Wait, but in a 5-row grid, rows 2,3,4 (middle three rows) have 0s in the middle columns. The columns are 4 elements, so the first and last are 8, the others 0.\n\nWait, the input for Example 2 is 5 rows, each with 4 zeros. The output for that example is 5 rows. The first and last rows are all 8s. The middle three rows (rows 2,3,4) are [8,0,0,8], so the first and last elements are 8, others 0. So for any row that's not the first or last, the edge elements (first and last) are 8, and the rest 0. So the pattern seems to be: for each row in the grid, if it's the first or last row, all elements are 8. For the other rows, the first and last elements are 8, and the rest are 0.\n\nWait, but let me check that against all examples. Example 0's input is 3x3. Output is:\n\n[8,8,8]\n\n[8,0,8]\n\n[8,8,8]\n\nSo the middle row (row 1) has first and last 8, middle 0. So yes, same as the pattern. For Example 1, input is 4x3. The output has first and last rows all 8s. The middle two rows (rows 1 and 2) have 8,0,8. So yes. For Example 2, 5x4. First and last rows all 8s. The middle three rows have 8,0,0,8. So for each middle row, first and last 8, others 0. Example 3's input is 5 rows of 6 elements. The output's first and last rows are all 8s. The middle rows (rows 1,2,3) are 8 followed by four 0s and ending with 8. Wait, no, the output for Example 3 is:\n\n[8,8,8,8,8,8]\n\n[8,0,0,0,0,8]\n\n[8,0,0,0,0,8]\n\n[8,0,0,0,0,8]\n\n[8,8,8,8,8,8]\n\nSo here, rows 1,2,3 (the middle rows) have 8 at the start and end, and 0s in between. So yes, same pattern: for each row that's not the first or last, the first and last elements are 8, the rest 0. The first and last rows are all 8s.\n\nSo the pattern seems to be: transform the input grid such that the first and last rows are all 8s, and for all other rows, the first and last elements are 8, and the rest are 0, regardless of the original input (since all inputs are all zeros). \n\nSo applying this to the test input. The test input is a 7x6 grid (7 rows, each with 6 zeros). Following the pattern, the first and last rows should be all 8s. The rows in between (rows 1 to 5) should have 8 as the first and last elements, and 0s in the middle. So each of those rows would be [8,0,0,0,0,8].\n\nLet me check the dimensions. The test input has 7 rows, each of 6 elements. So output should be:\n\nFirst row: [8,8,8,8,8,8]\n\nThen rows 1 to 5 (second to sixth rows): [8,0,0,0,0,8]\n\nLast row: [8,8,8,8,8,8]\n\nThat's seven rows. Let's count:\n\nRow 0: all 8s.\n\nRows 1-5: each has 8 at start and end, 0s in between.\n\nRow 6: all 8s.\n\nYes, that fits the pattern observed in the training examples. So the answer should follow this structure.",

        "cot_2": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. So the task is to transform the input matrix of zeros into an output matrix filled with 8s and 0s in some specific way. Let's look at the training examples one by one.\n\nStarting with Example 0:\n\nInput is a 3x3 matrix of zeros. The output has 8s around the edges and a 0 in the center. So the first and last rows are all 8s, same with the first and last columns. The middle element is 0. So for a 3x3 grid, it's like creating a border of 8s with a single 0 in the middle.\n\nExample 1 is a 4x3 matrix. The output has the first and last rows as all 8s. The middle rows (second and third) have 8s at the ends and 0 in the middle. So here, the columns are still 3 elements, but the rows are more. So for each row except the first and last, the first and last elements are 8, and the middle is 0. But wait, the output in example 1 is 4 rows. The first row is [8,8,8], the second and third are [8,0,8], and the fourth is [8,8,8]. So for even number of rows, maybe the middle rows (excluding first and last) have the 0 in the middle?\n\nExample 2 is a 5x4 matrix. The output is first and last rows all 8s. The middle rows (rows 2,3,4) have 8s at the start and end, and 0s in between. So for a 5x4 matrix, the output's first and last rows are all 8s. The middle rows have 8s only on the first and last elements, and 0s in the others. So for columns, if the original column length is n, the output's middle columns (not first or last) are 0 except the first and last which are 8.\n\nExample 3 is a 5x6 input. The output has first and last rows as all 8s. The rows in between have 8s at the start and end, and 0s in between. So regardless of the number of columns, the border rows (first and last) are all 8s, and the inner rows have 8s only on the edges with 0s filling the middle.\n\nSo the general pattern seems to be:\n\n- For any input matrix of m rows and n columns filled with 0s, the output is a matrix where:\n\n1. The first and last rows are entirely 8s.\n2. For the rows in between (rows 2 to m-1 if m>2), the first and last elements are 8, and the rest are 0s.\n3. The columns: The first and last columns in the inner rows (non-border rows) are 8, others 0.\n\nWait, but looking at example 2's output: input is 5 rows (each of 4 elements). The output rows between first and last have first and last as 8 and middle as 0. For example, row 2 of output is [8,0,0,8], which in a 4-element row, the first and last are 8, the middle two are 0. Similarly, in example 3's output, each row (except first and last) has 8 at the start and end, and the middle elements (four 0s in a 6-element row) are 0.\n\nSo the pattern is: for each row except the first and last, set the first and last elements to 8 and the rest to 0. The first and last rows are all 8s.\n\nSo regardless of the number of rows or columns, the transformation is:\n\n- Convert all elements in the first and last rows to 8.\n- For other rows, set the first and last element to 8 and the rest to 0.\n\nYes, that seems to fit all the examples.\n\nLet me check each example again:\n\nExample 0: 3x3. First and last rows are all 8s. Middle row is [8,0,8]. Correct.\n\nExample 1: 4x3. First and last rows all 8s. Middle rows (rows 2 and 3) are [8,0,8]. Correct.\n\nExample 2: 5x4. First and last rows all 8s. Middle three rows have [8,0,0,8]. Yes, since n=4, so first and last elements are 8, middle two are 0.\n\nExample 3: 5x6. First and last rows all 8s. Middle rows have 8 at both ends and four 0s in between.\n\nSo applying this to the test input. The test input is a 7x6 matrix (7 rows, each with 6 elements). So according to the pattern:\n\n- First and last rows become [8,8,8,8,8,8].\n- The middle five rows (rows 2 to 6) will each have first and last elements as 8, and the middle four elements as 0. So each of those rows would be [8,0,0,0,0,8].\n\nSo the output should be:\n\nRow 1: [8,8,8,8,8,8]\n\nRows 2-6: [8,0,0,0,0,8]\n\nRow 7: [8,8,8,8,8,8]\n\nSo the final output is seven rows. Let's check the number of elements per row. Each row has 6 elements. The first and last rows are all 8s. The rows in between have 8, followed by four 0s, then 8. Exactly matching the pattern."
