        "cot_1": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. So, the input is a 5x5 grid of numbers, and the output is another grid. Let me look at the training examples first.\n\nStarting with Example 0:\nInput has a 1 in the middle of the third row and a 5 in the fourth row middle. The fifth row is all 5s. The output shows that the 1 and the 5 in the third and fourth rows are gone, except the 5 in the fourth row remains. Then the fifth row now has a 1 in the middle. So maybe there's some swapping happening between the 1 and 5 in certain positions?\n\nExample 1:\nInput third row has two 1s, fourth row has two 5s. The output removes the 1s from the third row, keeps the 5s in the fourth, and the fifth row now has 1s where the 5s were in the fourth row's positions. So like each 1 in the third row corresponds to a 5 in the fourth row directly below, and those 5s in the fourth row become 1s in the fifth row? Or maybe moving the 1s down to the fifth row, replacing the 5s?\n\nExample 2:\nThird row has 1s in positions 2 and 5. Fourth row has 5s in same columns. Output fifth row has 1s in those columns. So it's like the 1s from the third row are moving down two rows to the fifth row, replacing the 5s there. And the 5s in the fourth row stay, but the third row's 1s are removed.\n\nPutting this together, maybe the rule is: For each 1 in the third row (row index 2 if starting from 0), look at the same column in the fourth row (row 3). If there's a 5 there, then in the fifth row (row 4), that column becomes 1. The original 1 in the third row becomes 0, and the 5 in the fourth row stays. Also, any 5s in the fifth row that are not under a 1 in the third row stay as 5. Wait, but in example 0, the fifth row becomes all 5s except the middle becomes 1. The fourth row's middle 5 stays. So in the fifth row, where the 5 was, it becomes 1 only if there was a 1 in the third row above the fourth row's 5.\n\nWait, let me rephrase. The third row (row 2) has 1s. For each 1 in row 2, column j, check if row 3, column j is 5. If so, then in row 5 (the last row), column j becomes 1 instead of 5, and the original 1 in row 2 becomes 0. The 5 in row 3 stays. Also, the fifth row's other elements remain 5s.\n\nSo the transformation is: Any 1 in the third row (row 2) that is directly above a 5 in the fourth row (row 3) will cause the fifth row (row 4) in that column to become 1, and the third row's 1 is set to 0. The fourth row's 5 remains. All other elements stay the same except the third row's elements (the 1s) are zeroed.\n\nTesting this against the examples. In Example 0:\n\nThird row has a 1 in column 2 (middle). Fourth row, column 2 is 5. So in fifth row, column 2 becomes 1. The fifth row was all 5s, so now it's 5s except middle is 1. The third row's 1 becomes 0. The fourth row's 5 remains. That's exactly the output.\n\nExample 1:\n\nThird row has 1s in columns 1 and 3. Fourth row columns 1 and 3 are 5. So fifth row columns 1 and 3 become 1. So fifth row becomes [5,1,5,1,5]. The third row's 1s become 0. That matches the output.\n\nExample 2:\n\nThird row has 1s in columns 1 and 4. Fourth row columns 1 and 4 are 5. So fifth row becomes 5s except columns 1 and 4 are 1. So fifth row is [5,1,5,5,1]. Third row's 1s become 0. Fourth row remains. Yes, matches.\n\nSo the pattern is: For each column in the third row (row index 2), if there is a 1 there and the same column in the fourth row (row 3) is 5, then in the fifth row (row 4), set that column to 1. Also, set the third row's 1s to 0. The rest of the grid remains the same.\n\nNow applying this to the Test Input:\n\nTest Input:\n\nThird row (row 2) is [0, 0, 1, 0, 1]. So columns 2 and 4 have 1s.\n\nFourth row (row 3) is [0, 0, 5, 0, 5]. So columns 2 and 4 have 5s. So in fifth row (row 4), columns 2 and 4 should become 1. The original fifth row is [5,5,5,5,5]. So after change, fifth row becomes [5,5,1,5,1].\n\nThird row's 1s (columns 2 and 4) become 0. So third row becomes [0,0,0,0,0].\n\nFourth row remains [0,0,5,0,5].\n\nOther rows remain as they are.\n\nSo the output should be:\n\n[0,0,0,0,0]\n\n[0,0,0,0,0]\n\n[0,0,0,0,0]\n\n[0,0,5,0,5]\n\n[5,5,1,5,1]\n\nYes, that's what I think. Let me check if this matches the training examples' pattern.",

        "cot_2": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. So, looking at the training examples, each input is a 5x5 grid, and there's some transformation happening to produce the output. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nStarting with Example 0. The input has a 1 in the middle of the third row and a 5 in the fourth row's middle. The output has that 1 replaced by 0 in the third row, the 5 stays in the fourth row, but in the fifth row, the middle element becomes 1, and the rest are 5s. Hmm. So maybe the 1 is moving down? But in the output, the fifth row's middle is 1, but the original fifth row was all 5s. So perhaps there's a swap between certain elements.\n\nLooking at the positions: In Example 0's input, the third row has a 1 at position [2][2], and the fourth row has 5 at [3][2]. The output's fifth row has 1 at [4][2], and the fourth row retains 5. So maybe 1s are moving down, and 5s are moving up? Or perhaps there's a vertical swap between 1 and 5 in the same column.\n\nLet's check Example 1. Input's third row has 1s at positions [2][1] and [2][3]. The fourth row has 5s at [3][1] and [3][3]. The output's fifth row has 1s at [4][1] and [4][3], while the fourth row keeps the 5s. So again, the 1s from the third row are moving down two rows to the fifth row, replacing the 5s there, and the 5s in the fourth row stay. Wait, but the fifth row in input is all 5s, and in output, those positions where 1s were in the third row now have 1s. So maybe wherever there's a 1 in row i, in the output, the same column in row i+2 becomes 1, and the original 1 is set to 0. But also, the fifth row in input is all 5s. So perhaps 1s are moving down two rows, replacing 5s there, and the original positions become 0. Then, the 5s in the fourth row (row index 3) stay as is. Let me check.\n\nIn Example 0: The 1 in row 2 (third row) moves down two rows to row 4 (fifth row), column 2. The original fifth row in that column was 5, which becomes 1. The fourth row's 5 in column 2 stays. Then, the original 1 in row 2 becomes 0. The fifth row's other 5s remain. Similarly in Example 1, the two 1s in row 2 move to row 4, same columns, replacing the 5s there, and the 5s in row 3 stay. That seems to fit.\n\nAnother observation: In the input, the fourth row (row index 3) has 5s in the same columns where the third row (row index 2) has 1s. Then, in the output, the fifth row (row index 4) in those columns becomes 1, and the original 1s in row 2 become 0. So the transformation is: For each 1 in row i (row 2), set the cell two rows below (i+2, same column) to 1, and set the original 1 to 0. Also, if the cell two rows below was a 5, it's replaced by 1. The 5s in row 3 (i+1) stay. Then, the fifth row's other 5s remain as 5.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. For each cell in the grid:\n   a. If the cell is 1 and it's in row 2 (third row), then look two rows below (row 4, same column).\n   b. Replace the value in row 4, same column with 1.\n   c. Set the original cell (row 2) to 0.\n   d. The 5s in row 3 (directly below row 2) remain as 5.\n\nWait, but in Example 0's input, the fourth row (row 3) has a 5 in column 2, which in the output remains 5. The fifth row's column 2 in input is 5, which becomes 1. So yes, the 1 from row 2 moves to row 4 (two rows down), replacing the 5 there. Then, the 5 in row 3 stays. So the key is that 1s in row 2 are moved down two rows, turning into 1s in row 4, replacing whatever was there (assuming 5s), and the original 1 becomes 0. The 5s in row 3 (the row below the original 1s) are untouched.\n\nNow, checking Example 2. The input has 1s in row 2 at columns 1 and 4. The output's row 4 (fifth row) has 1s in columns 1 and 4, replacing the 5s there. The original 1s in row 2 are set to 0. The 5s in row 3 (same columns) remain. So this fits the pattern.\n\nSo the general rule seems to be:\n\n- For any 1 in row index 2 (third row), move it down two rows to row index 4 (fifth row), same column. Replace the value there (which was a 5 in the examples) with 1. The original 1 becomes 0.\n- The 5s in row index 3 (fourth row) are left as is.\n- All other cells remain unchanged except for those affected by moving the 1s.\n\nNow, let's apply this to the test input.\n\nTest Input:\n\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[0, 0, 1, 0, 1]  // Row 2: columns 2 and 4 have 1s\n[0, 0, 5, 0, 5]   // Row 3: columns 2 and 4 have 5s\n[5, 5, 5, 5, 5]   // Row 4: all 5s\n\nFollowing the pattern:\n\nThe 1s in row 2 (columns 2 and 4) should be moved to row 4 (columns 2 and 4). So in row 4, columns 2 and 4 will become 1, replacing the 5s. The original 1s in row 2 become 0. The 5s in row 3 (columns 2 and 4) remain 5. All other cells should stay the same except these changes.\n\nSo the output should be:\n\nRow 2 (third row) becomes all 0s except columns 2 and 4 are 0 now.\n\nRow 4 (fifth row) becomes [5,5,5,5,5] with columns 2 and 4 changed to 1. So:\n\nOriginal row 4: [5,5,5,5,5]\n\nAfter change: [5,5,1,5,1]\n\nRow 3 remains [0,0,5,0,5]\n\nSo the output grid would be:\n\n[0,0,0,0,0]\n\n[0,0,0,0,0]\n\n[0,0,0,0,0]  // Row 2 is now all 0s\n\n[0,0,5,0,5]   // Row 3 remains\n\n[5,5,1,5,1]  // Row 4 has 1s in columns 2 and 4\n\nLet me check if this matches the training examples' structure. For example, in Example 1, the output's fifth row is [5,1,5,1,5], which is similar. So yes, the 1s in the fifth row are placed where the original 1s were in the third row's columns.\n\nSo applying this to the test input, the answer should be:\n\n[0,0,0,0,0]\n\n[0,0,0,0,0]\n\n[0,0,0,0,0]\n\n[0,0,5,0,5]\n\n[5,5,1,5,1]"
