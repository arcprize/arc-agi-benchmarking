        "cot_1": "Okay, let's see. I need to figure out the pattern from the training examples to apply it to the test input. Let's start by looking at each example one by one.\n\nIn Example 0, the input is a 3x3 grid:\n[9, 0, 0]\n[9, 9, 9]\n[9, 9, 9]\nAnd the output is:\n[0, 9, 9]\n[0, 9, 9]\n[9, 9, 9]\nHmm. So the first row changes from [9,0,0] to [0,9,9]. The second row starts with 9,9,9 and becomes 0,9,9. The third row stays the same. Maybe there's some rotation or shifting going on. Wait, maybe the rows are being rotated or shifted in some way. Let's check the other examples.\n\nExample 1:\nInput:\n[6,6,6]\n[0,0,0]\n[6,6,0]\nOutput:\n[6,0,0]\n[6,0,6]\n[6,0,6]\nOriginal first row [6,6,6] becomes [6,0,0]. The second row [0,0,0] becomes [6,0,6]. Third row becomes [6,0,6]. Not sure. Maybe each element is being transformed based on its position or neighbors.\n\nExample 2:\nInput:\n[0,0,9]\n[0,0,9]\n[9,9,9]\nOutput:\n[9,9,9]\n[0,0,9]\n[0,0,9]\nSo the first and second rows are swapped with the third? Wait, the input's third row is [9,9,9], which becomes the first row in the output. The other rows shift down. So maybe a vertical flip? Like the entire grid is flipped vertically. Let's check. Input rows are row0, row1, row2. Output is row2, row1, row0? No, in example 0, input row2 is [9,9,9], and output row2 is [9,9,9]. So maybe not a vertical flip. Or perhaps only certain rows are being reversed.\n\nWait example 2's output is [9,9,9], [0,0,9], [0,0,9], which is the input's third row moved to the top, and the other two rows moved down. So perhaps shifting rows down, but with the bottom row moving to the top? Like a rotation of rows. But example 0: the original third row [9,9,9] stays in the third row. The first two rows in the input become the first two rows in the output but modified. So maybe it's not a simple row rotation.\n\nAlternatively, looking at each individual column. Let's check example 0's columns. Original columns are:\n\nCol0: 9,9,9\nCol1: 0,9,9\nCol2:0,9,9\n\nOutput columns:\n0,0,9\n9,9,9\n9,9,9\n\nWait, maybe columns are being rotated. For example, column 0 in input becomes [9,9,9], but in the output, column0 is [0,0,9]. Hmm, not sure.\n\nAnother approach: looking for the positions where numbers change. Let's compare the input and output in each example.\n\nIn Example 0:\nInput row0: [9,0,0] \u2192 output row0: [0,9,9]. So the first element becomes 0, the next two become 9.\nInput row1: [9,9,9] \u2192 output row1: [0,9,9]. First element becomes 0.\nRow2 remains the same.\n\nSo perhaps the first element of each row is being set to 0, except for the last row? Wait, in example0, row0's first element becomes 0, row1's first becomes 0. Row2 stays same. Then in the output, the first two rows start with 0.\n\nBut in Example1:\nInput row0: [6,6,6] \u2192 output row0: [6,0,0]. So first element remains 6, second and third become 0.\nRow1: [0,0,0] \u2192 becomes [6,0,6]. First element 0 becomes 6, third becomes 6.\nRow2: [6,6,0] \u2192 becomes [6,0,6].\n\nWait, this doesn't seem to fit the same pattern. Maybe there's a different transformation.\n\nLooking for possible rotation or shift. Maybe each row is rotated to the right or left. Let's see example0:\n\nOriginal row0: [9,0,0]. If rotated left once, [0,0,9]. But output is [0,9,9]. Not matching. Rotated right once would be [0,9,0]. Not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each row is reversed. Row0 reversed would be [0,0,9], but output is [0,9,9]. Not the same. Hmm.\n\nLooking at example2's input:\n\nOriginal rows:\n[0,0,9]\n[0,0,9]\n[9,9,9]\n\nOutput:\n[9,9,9]\n[0,0,9]\n[0,0,9]\n\nSo the third row moves to the top, and the first two rows are moved down. That looks like a vertical flip. Because flipping the rows vertically would reverse the order. So input rows are row0, row1, row2. Flip to row2, row1, row0. But in example2, the output is row2, row0, row1? Wait, original row0 is [0,0,9], row1 is same. Output's row1 is [0,0,9], row2 is [0,0,9]. Wait, no. Wait, in the input, the rows are:\n\nrow0: [0,0,9]\n\nrow1: [0,0,9]\n\nrow2: [9,9,9]\n\nOutput:\n\nrow0: [9,9,9]\n\nrow1: [0,0,9]\n\nrow2: [0,0,9]\n\nSo output's rows are row2, row0, row1? Because row0 of output is row2 of input. Then row1 of output is row0 of input, and row2 is row1. So it's like a rotation where the bottom row comes to the top, and the others shift down. But example0 doesn't follow that. Let me check example0's input and output.\n\nExample0 input:\n\nrow0: [9,0,0]\n\nrow1: [9,9,9]\n\nrow2: [9,9,9]\n\nOutput:\n\nrow0: [0,9,9]\n\nrow1: [0,9,9]\n\nrow2: [9,9,9]\n\nSo the first two rows are modified, but the third remains. So maybe vertical flip isn't the pattern here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each row is being transformed based on some operation. Let's look for a pattern in how elements change.\n\nIn Example0:\n\nInput row0: [9,0,0] \u2192 Output row0: [0,9,9]\n\nThe first element becomes 0, and the next two become 9. But why?\n\nLooking at the other rows:\n\nInput row1: [9,9,9] \u2192 Output row1: [0,9,9]. First element 9 \u2192 0, others remain.\n\nRow2 remains same.\n\nIn Example1:\n\nInput row0: [6,6,6] \u2192 Output [6,0,0]. First remains, others 0.\n\nRow1: [0,0,0] \u2192 [6,0,6]. First 0\u21926, third 0\u21926.\n\nRow2: [6,6,0] \u2192 [6,0,6]. Middle 6\u21920, third 0\u21926.\n\nHmm. Maybe the elements are being modified based on their position. For example, in the output, certain positions are changed to 0 or other values.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a shift where each row is shifted left or right, but with a carryover from the adjacent row or column.\n\nAnother angle: check if the output is a transformation where each element is the sum or difference of adjacent elements. Or maybe a reflection across a diagonal.\n\nWait, in example3:\n\nInput:\n[2,0,2]\n[0,0,2]\n[0,2,2]\n\nOutput:\n[2,2,2]\n[0,0,2]\n[2,0,0]\n\nInput's first row becomes [2,2,2]. The third row becomes [2,0,0]. Maybe the first and third rows are being swapped in some way, but not exactly. Let's see.\n\nOriginal first row is [2,0,2], becomes [2,2,2]. Third row [0,2,2] becomes [2,0,0]. So the third row's elements are reversed and maybe modified. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that each column is rotated or shifted. Let's look at the columns in example0:\n\nInput columns:\n\nCol0: 9,9,9 \u2192 Output col0:0,0,9\n\nCol1:0,9,9 \u2192 Output col1:9,9,9\n\nCol2:0,9,9 \u2192 Output col2:9,9,9\n\nSo col0 in output is [0,0,9], which is the first two elements 0 and the third from input's col0. Maybe the columns are shifted upwards. Like each column is shifted up by one, and the top element is replaced by 0. Wait, original col0: 9,9,9. Shift up would be 9,9,9 \u2192 9,9,9 (since shifted up, the first element is removed, but that's not matching). Alternatively, shifting down. Shift down would add a 0 at the top. For example, original col0: 9,9,9. Shift down once \u2192 0 (new),9,9. But output col0 is [0,0,9], which would need to shift down twice. Hmm. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each column is reversed. Original col0: 9,9,9 reversed is still 9,9,9. But output col0 is [0,0,9]. So that's not matching.\n\nAnother approach: looking at the number of 0s and other digits. In example0's input, there are two 0s. Output has three 0s. Example1's input has six 0s, output has five. Not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps the pattern is that each row is rotated to the left, but with the first element moving to the end, and then some elements are set to 0 or another value. Let's check example0:\n\nInput row0: [9,0,0]. Rotating left once would be [0,0,9]. Then maybe setting the first element to 0 \u2192 [0,0,9]? No, but the output is [0,9,9]. Not matching.\n\nAlternatively, rotating right once: [0,9,0]. Not matching.\n\nHmm. Let's think of the output as the input with certain operations applied. For instance, in example0, the first element of each row (except the last) is set to 0. Let's check:\n\nRow0: first element 9 \u2192 0.\n\nRow1: first element 9 \u2192 0.\n\nRow2: stays same.\n\nThen, the other elements are 9s. But in row0, the original elements after the first were 0,0. Now they are 9,9. So that's a problem. So that idea doesn't hold.\n\nWait, perhaps the non-zero elements are preserved, and zeros are filled in certain positions. But in example0's row0, the input has 9,0,0. The output is 0,9,9. So the 9 is moved to the second and third positions. Maybe shifting the elements to the right. Like shifting right once, so the last element becomes the first, and the others shift. But [9,0,0] shifted right once would be [0,9,0], but output is [0,9,9]. Not exactly. Or maybe shifting twice. Shifting right twice: [0,0,9], but output is [0,9,9]. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the first element is moved to the end and replaced by 0. So for row0: [9,0,0] \u2192 move 9 to end \u2192 [0,0,9], then replace first with 0 \u2192 no, that would be [0,0,9]. But output is [0,9,9]. Not matching.\n\nAlternatively, in example0, the first element is replaced by 0, and the rest are filled with 9. So regardless of input, after first element, others are 9. But in example1's row0: input [6,6,6] becomes [6,0,0]. So first element remains 6, others become 0. That's different. So perhaps the transformation depends on something else.\n\nLooking at example2 again: input's third row [9,9,9] becomes the first row in output, and the first two rows are moved down. So maybe the pattern is that the output's first row is the input's last row, and the rest of the rows are shifted down. But in example0, the third row is [9,9,9], which remains in the output as the third row. So that doesn't fit. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe the transformation is based on flipping the grid vertically. Let's check:\n\nExample2's input is:\n\n[0,0,9]\n\n[0,0,9]\n\n[9,9,9]\n\nVertically flipped (rows reversed) would be:\n\n[9,9,9]\n\n[0,0,9]\n\n[0,0,9]\n\nWhich matches the output. So example2's output is the vertical flip of the input.\n\nBut example0's input:\n\n[9,0,0]\n\n[9,9,9]\n\n[9,9,9]\n\nVertically flipped would be:\n\n[9,9,9]\n\n[9,9,9]\n\n[9,0,0]\n\nWhich is not the output. So example2's case fits vertical flip, but example0 does not. So maybe there's a mix of operations. Maybe some examples use vertical flips and others use different transformations. That complicates things.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the pattern is that the output is the vertical flip of the input, but with some elements modified. For example, in example0, vertical flip would give:\n\n[9,9,9]\n\n[9,9,9]\n\n[9,0,0]\n\nBut the actual output is:\n\n[0,9,9]\n\n[0,9,9]\n\n[9,9,9]\n\nSo that's different. So vertical flip isn't the answer here.\n\nLet's try another angle. Let's look for a pattern in each position of the grid.\n\nIn example0:\n\nInput grid:\n\nRow0: 9,0,0\n\nRow1:9,9,9\n\nRow2:9,9,9\n\nOutput:\n\nRow0:0,9,9\n\nRow1:0,9,9\n\nRow2:9,9,9\n\nComparing input and output, the first element of each row (except row2) becomes 0. Then the second and third elements of those rows become 9.\n\nIn example1:\n\nInput:\n\nRow0:6,6,6 \u2192 output:6,0,0\n\nRow1:0,0,0 \u2192 output:6,0,6\n\nRow2:6,6,0 \u2192 output:6,0,6\n\nHere, row0's first element stays 6, second and third become 0. Row1's first becomes 6, third becomes 6. Row2's middle becomes 0, third becomes 6.\n\nThis seems inconsistent. Maybe the transformation varies per example. But the problem states there's a single pattern across all examples. So I must find a common rule.\n\nAnother approach: maybe the output grid is the transpose of the input matrix, but with some modification. The transpose of example0's input would be:\n\n9,9,9\n\n0,9,9\n\n0,9,9\n\nWhich is not the output. But example0's output is:\n\n0,9,9\n\n0,9,9\n\n9,9,9\n\nWhich is similar to the transpose but with the first column changed to 0,0,9. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is the input matrix rotated 90 degrees. Rotating example0's input 90 degrees clockwise would result in:\n\n9,9,9\n\n9,9,9\n\n0,9,9\n\nWhich is not the output. So that's not it.\n\nLooking back at example3:\n\nInput:\n\n[2,0,2]\n\n[0,0,2]\n\n[0,2,2]\n\nOutput:\n\n[2,2,2]\n\n[0,0,2]\n\n[2,0,0]\n\nInput's row0 becomes [2,2,2]. So all elements in row0 are 2. Original row0 had two 2s and a 0. So maybe in the output, the 0 in row0 is replaced by 2. Then row1 remains the same. Row2 becomes [2,0,0]. Original row2 was [0,2,2]. So reversed? [2,2,0] reversed would be [0,2,2], but output is [2,0,0]. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, for each row, if the first element is non-zero, then replace the other elements with 0? No, in example0, the first row's first element is 9 (non-zero), so other elements would be replaced with 0. But in example0's output, the other elements are 9. So that's not right.\n\nHmm. Maybe I need to look at each cell and see what changes. Let's make a table of each cell's input and output for the examples.\n\nFor example0:\n\nInput:\n\nRow0: [9,0,0] \u2192 [0,9,9]\n\nRow1: [9,9,9] \u2192 [0,9,9]\n\nRow2: [9,9,9] \u2192 [9,9,9]\n\nSo in row0, cell0: 9\u21920, cell1:0\u21929, cell2:0\u21929\n\nRow1: cell0:9\u21920, others stay 9.\n\nRow2: all stay.\n\nExample1:\n\nRow0:6\u21926,6\u21920,6\u21920\n\nRow1:0\u21926,0\u21920,0\u21926\n\nRow2:6\u21926,6\u21920,0\u21926\n\nExample2:\n\nInput rows:\n\n[0,0,9] \u2192 [9,9,9]\n\n[0,0,9] \u2192 [0,0,9]\n\n[9,9,9] \u2192 [0,0,9]\n\nSo row0's elements all change. 0\u21929, 0\u21929, 9\u21929.\n\nRow1: stays same.\n\nRow2: 9\u21920, 9\u21920,9\u21929?\n\nWait example2's output is:\n\n[9,9,9]\n\n[0,0,9]\n\n[0,0,9]\n\nOriginal row2 is [9,9,9] becomes row0 in output. So entire row is moved up. So perhaps each row is shifted up by one, with the top row wrapping to the bottom? But example0's output doesn't fit that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each row is shifted up, and the first row is moved to the bottom. So in example2, shifting up once: the original rows are row0, row1, row2. Shift up once becomes row1, row2, row0. Then row0's new row0 is original row1: [0,0,9], row1 becomes row2: [9,9,9], row2 becomes row0: [0,0,9]. But output is row2 becomes row0. So that's not matching. The output for example2 is [9,9,9], [0,0,9], [0,0,9], which would require shifting up once but row2 is moved to row0, and row0 and row1 are moved down. Not sure.\n\nAnother thought: maybe the output is the input with each row shifted to the right by one, and the first element of each row is replaced by 0. Let's check example0:\n\nOriginal row0: [9,0,0]. Shift right by one: [0,9,0]. Replace first element with 0 \u2192 [0,9,0]. But output row0 is [0,9,9]. Doesn't match.\n\nAlternatively, shift right by one and set the last element to 9. So for row0: shift right to [0,9,0], then set last element to 9 \u2192 [0,9,9]. That matches. Then row1: [9,9,9] shifted right \u2192 [9,9,9], then first element becomes 0 \u2192 [0,9,9]. Row2 remains same.\n\nBut example1:\n\nRow0 input [6,6,6]. Shift right \u2192 [6,6,6]. Replace first with 0 \u2192 [0,6,6]. But output row0 is [6,0,0]. Doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. So that pattern doesn't hold for example1.\n\nAlternative idea: For each cell, if the cell is 0, it becomes the value of the cell below it. But example0's row0, cell1 is 0. Cell below it in row1, cell1 is 9. So 0\u21929. That matches. Cell2 in row0 is 0 \u2192 cell below is 9 \u2192 becomes 9. That matches. Row0 cell0 is 9 \u2192 but becomes 0. So that doesn't fit. So maybe only zeros are replaced by the cell below.\n\nIn example0's row0 cell0 is 9. It becomes 0. That doesn't fit. So that idea might not work.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each element is replaced by the sum of the elements in the same column, but that's unlikely. For example0, column0 sum is 9+9+9=27. Output column0 is 0+0+9=9. Doesn't align.\n\nAnother approach: looking for a pattern where each row in the output is the previous row from the input. For example, output row0 is input row1, output row1 is input row2, output row2 is input row0. Let's check example0.\n\nInput rows:\n\nrow0: [9,0,0]\n\nrow1: [9,9,9]\n\nrow2: [9,9,9]\n\nIf output rows are row1, row2, row0, then output would be:\n\n[9,9,9]\n\n[9,9,9]\n\n[9,0,0]\n\nWhich is not what the output is. So that's not the case.\n\nWait example2's output is [9,9,9], [0,0,9], [0,0,9]. Which is the input's row2, row0, row1. So maybe it's shifting the rows down by one, and the last row wraps to the top. So in example2:\n\nOriginal rows: row0, row1, row2 \u2192 after shifting down by one (moving each row down, and row2 wraps to top), becomes row2, row0, row1. Which matches the output.\n\nExample0:\n\nOriginal rows: row0, row1, row2. Shifting down would make row2, row0, row1. So output should be:\n\n[9,9,9], [9,0,0], [9,9,9]\n\nBut actual output is:\n\n[0,9,9]\n\n[0,9,9]\n\n[9,9,9]\n\nSo that doesn't match. So example0 doesn't follow this pattern.\n\nHmm. This is getting complicated. Let's try to think differently. Maybe each row is transformed based on some rule.\n\nLooking at example0's row0: [9,0,0] \u2192 [0,9,9]\n\nThe first element is 9, which becomes 0. The other two 0s become 9s.\n\nExample1's row0: [6,6,6] \u2192 [6,0,0]. The first element remains 6, others become 0.\n\nExample2's row0: [0,0,9] \u2192 [9,9,9]. All elements become 9.\n\nExample3's row0: [2,0,2] \u2192 [2,2,2]. The 0 becomes 2.\n\nSo what's the pattern here? It seems that in the first row of the output, the elements are transformed based on the first element of the input row. For example, if the input row starts with 9 (example0), then the output row starts with 0 and the others are 9. If the input row starts with 6 (example1), the output row starts with 6 and others are 0. If the input row starts with 0 (example2), all elements become 9. If the input row starts with 2 (example3), all elements become 2.\n\nWait, this could be a pattern. Let's check:\n\nFor each row in the input:\n\n- If the first element is X (non-zero), then the output row is [X, 0, 0].\n- If the first element is 0, then the output row is filled with 9s.\n\nBut wait example0's row0 starts with 9, and output is [0,9,9]. So that doesn't fit. So maybe not.\n\nAnother observation: In example0's output row0 and row1 start with 0, which is not present in their original rows except for row0's position. So maybe there's a substitution of the first element based on some condition.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is created by taking each row, rotating it, and modifying certain elements. For instance, in example0, row0 [9,0,0] becomes [0,9,9]. It's as if the 9 is moved to the second and third positions, and the first becomes 0. But how?\n\nAnother approach: maybe the transformation is to reverse each row and then replace the first occurrence of a certain number with another. For example0, reversing row0 gives [0,0,9]. Then replacing the first 0 with 9 gives [9,0,9]. No, doesn't match.\n\nAlternatively, reverse the row and then replace the first element with 0. [0,0,9] reversed is [9,0,0]. Replace first element with 0 \u2192 [0,0,0], which isn't the output.\n\nHmm. Let's look at the third example:\n\nExample3 input row0: [2,0,2] \u2192 output [2,2,2]\n\nSo the 0 is replaced by 2. So perhaps in each row, any 0 is replaced by the first element of the row. In row0 of example3, first element is 2, so 0\u21922.\n\nExample0's row0: first element is 9. So 0s in the row would be replaced by 9. The original row0 has [9,0,0]. Output is [0,9,9]. So first element is 0, others are 9. So if the first element is replaced by 0, and the 0s are replaced by 9. That fits. So the rule could be: For each row, set the first element to 0, and replace all 0s in the row with the original first element's value. But let's test this.\n\nExample0 row0:\n\nOriginal first element is 9. Replace first element with 0. Then replace all 0s in the row with 9. Original row after replacing first element: [0,0,0]. Then replace 0s with 9: [9,9,9]. But the output is [0,9,9]. So this doesn't fit. Because after setting first element to 0, the row is [0,0,0], then replacing all 0s with 9 would make [9,9,9]. But the output is [0,9,9]. So the first element remains 0. So maybe the replacement is done after setting the first element to 0, but leave the first element as 0.\n\nWait, maybe the rule is: For each row, replace all 0s with the original first element's value, then set the first element to 0.\n\nLet's test this for example0:\n\nRow0: [9,0,0]\n\nReplace 0s with 9 \u2192 [9,9,9]. Then set first element to 0 \u2192 [0,9,9]. Which matches the output.\n\nRow1: [9,9,9]. No zeros. So replacing 0s (none) \u2192 same. Set first element to 0 \u2192 [0,9,9]. Which matches.\n\nRow2: [9,9,9]. No zeros. Set first to 0 \u2192 no. Output row2 is [9,9,9]. So for row2, the first element isn't set to 0. So this pattern applies only to certain rows. Hmm.\n\nWait example0's output for row2 is the same as input. So perhaps this rule applies only to the first two rows.\n\nBut example1:\n\nInput row0: [6,6,6]\n\nReplace 0s (none) with 6 \u2192 same. Set first to 0 \u2192 [0,6,6]. But output row0 is [6,0,0]. Doesn't match.\n\nSo this idea doesn't hold.\n\nAlternative approach: perhaps the transformation is applied per row where the first element is moved to the end, and all other elements are replaced with 0. Then, in example0's row0, [9,0,0] \u2192 move first to end: [0,0,9], then replace other elements (except first?) with 0. Not sure.\n\nAnother possible pattern: For each row, swap the first and last elements, then replace the middle element with 9. Let's test example0's row0:\n\nSwap first and last: [0,0,9] \u2192 then replace middle with 9 \u2192 [0,9,9]. Which matches. Row1: [9,9,9] \u2192 swap first and last \u2192 [9,9,9] \u2192 replace middle with 9 (no change). So output [9,9,9]. But actual output row1 is [0,9,9]. So this doesn't work.\n\nHmm. I'm stuck. Let's look for another approach. Maybe the pattern is related to the number of occurrences of a particular digit.\n\nIn example0, input has two 0s, output has three 0s (two in row0 and row1). Example1's input has six 0s (row1 has three, row0 has none, row2 has one?), output has five. Not sure.\n\nWait, example3's input has three 0s. Output has two 0s.\n\nPerhaps the transformation involves moving the zeros to certain positions. Let's see:\n\nIn example0's output, zeros are in the first column. Example1's output has zeros in the second and third columns. Example2's output has no zeros in the first row, but in the second and third rows. Not obvious.\n\nAlternative idea: Let's consider that each row in the output is a modified version of the previous row from the input. For example:\n\nIn example0, output row0 is the input row0 with first element set to 0 and others to 9. Output row1 is input row1 with first element set to 0. Output row2 is same as input row2.\n\nIn example1, output row0 is input row0 with first element kept as 6, others set to 0. Output row1 is input row0's first element (6) as first element, others set to 0 and 6. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the output rows are formed by taking the first element of the row below and applying it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is created by taking each row and replacing each element with the value from the cell diagonally opposite. For example, the first element of the first row becomes the last element of the last row. But this seems too vague.\n\nAnother possible pattern: Each row in the output is a reversed copy of the corresponding input row, with some modifications. For example0's row0: reversed is [0,0,9]. Then, the first element is replaced by 0: [0,0,9] \u2192 but output is [0,9,9]. So not matching.\n\nAlternatively, reverse the row and replace the first element with 0. [0,0,9] becomes [0,9,0]. Not matching.\n\nHmm. Let's think about the test input:\n\nTest input:\n[0, 0, 0]\n[5, 0, 0]\n[0, 5, 5]\n\nWhat would the output be if the pattern from the examples is applied?\n\nLooking at the examples, perhaps the transformation for each row is to replace the first element with 0 and replace all 0s in the row with the original first element's value. But in example0's row0, this works. Let's test this:\n\nFor each row in the input:\n\n1. Take the first element (F).\n2. Replace all 0s in the row with F.\n3. Set the first element to 0.\n\nLet's apply this to example0's row0:\n\nF =9.\n\nReplace 0s with 9 \u2192 [9,9,9].\n\nSet first element to 0 \u2192 [0,9,9]. Correct.\n\nExample0 row1:\n\nF=9. No 0s \u2192 [9,9,9]. Set first to 0 \u2192 [0,9,9]. Correct.\n\nExample0 row2: no 0s. So no change. Correct.\n\nExample1 row0:\n\nF=6. Replace 0s (none) \u2192 [6,6,6]. Set first to 0 \u2192 [0,6,6]. But example1's output row0 is [6,0,0]. So this doesn't match.\n\nHmm. So this works for example0 but not example1.\n\nWait example1's row0 is [6,6,6]. According to the rule, after step 2, it's still [6,6,6]. Step3: set first to 0 \u2192 [0,6,6]. But the output is [6,0,0]. So this rule doesn't apply here.\n\nBut wait, maybe the rule is different. For example, replace all elements except the first with 0. Let's see:\n\nExample1 row0: [6,6,6] \u2192 [6,0,0]. Which matches the output. Row1: [0,0,0]. Replace all except first with 0. But first is 0. So row becomes [0,0,0]. Then replace first with 6 \u2192 [6,0,0]. But output row1 is [6,0,6]. Doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. Let's look at example1's output row1: [6,0,6]. The input row1 was [0,0,0]. So how does that become [6,0,6]?\n\nMaybe the first element is taken from the row above's first element. For example, row1's first element in the output is 6, which is the first element of the row above (row0) in the input. Then, the other elements are set to 0 except the last, which is taken from the row below? Not sure.\n\nIn example1, the input's row0 is [6,6,6], row1 is [0,0,0], row2 is [6,6,0]. Output row0 is [6,0,0], row1 is [6,0,6], row2 is [6,0,6].\n\nLooking at output row1's elements: 6,0,6. The first element could be from row0's first element (6). The third element could be from row2's first element (6). The middle is 0. But I'm not sure how that's determined.\n\nAnother approach: for each cell in the output, it's equal to the cell above it in the input. For example, output row0, cell0 is input row0, cell0 \u2192 6. output row0, cell1 is input row0, cell1 \u21926. But in example1's output row0 is [6,0,0], so cell1 and 2 are 0. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, each cell in the output is equal to the cell from the previous row in the input. For example, output row0, cell0 is input row0, cell0 (6). Output row0, cell1 is input row0-1 (which doesn't exist) or input row0's cell1. Not helpful.\n\nThis is really challenging. Let's look for another pattern. Let's consider that in each example, the output is derived by taking the input and shifting each row in a certain way, possibly moving elements and replacing some with zeros.\n\nIn example3's input:\n\n[2,0,2]\n\n[0,0,2]\n\n[0,2,2]\n\nOutput:\n\n[2,2,2]\n\n[0,0,2]\n\n[2,0,0]\n\nRow0 becomes [2,2,2]. So the 0 is replaced with 2. Row1 stays the same. Row2 becomes [2,0,0]. Original row2 is [0,2,2]. So perhaps the row is reversed and then the first element is taken from another row.\n\nAnother idea: Perhaps the output is generated by rotating each row to the right by the number of positions equal to the row index. For example, row0 rotates 0 positions (remains the same), row1 rotates 1 position, row2 rotates 2 positions. Let's test example0:\n\nRow0 (index 0): [9,0,0] \u2192 no rotation. But output row0 is [0,9,9]. Doesn't match.\n\nExample2's input row0 is [0,0,9]. Rotate right by 0 \u2192 [0,0,9]. Output row0 is [9,9,9]. No match.\n\nNot helpful.\n\nHmm. Let's try to think of the output as a combination of the input's rows and columns in some way. For example, in example0, the output's first column is [0,0,9], which is the reverse of the input's first column (9,9,9 \u2192 reversed 9,9,9, but output's first column is 0,0,9). Doesn't make sense.\n\nAnother possible pattern: Each row in the output is the input's previous row. For example, output row0 is input row1, row1 is input row2, row2 is input row0. Let's check example2:\n\nInput rows: row0 [0,0,9], row1 [0,0,9], row2 [9,9,9]\n\nOutput rows: [9,9,9], [0,0,9], [0,0,9]. So output row0 is input row2, row1 is input row0, row2 is input row1. So it's like rotating the rows down by one. But example0's output doesn't follow this. So perhaps this is only the case for some examples, which isn't helpful.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation involves replacing certain elements with the value from the row below. For example, in example0's row0, cell0 is 9. The cell below it (row1, cell0) is 9. So output row0, cell0 becomes 0. Not sure.\n\nWait, example0's output row0, cell0 is 0. The cell below in input is 9. So maybe the output cell is 0 if the cell and the cell below are both 9. But that's not general.\n\nThis is really tough. Maybe I should look for a pattern that involves each cell being a function of its position and the original cell's value. For example, in the output, each cell is the original cell's value minus 9 if possible. But example0's cell0 in row0 becomes 0 (9-9=0), cell1 becomes 9 (0+9), but that's inconsistent.\n\nAnother observation: In example0 and example2, the output has the same number of 9s as the input, but rearranged. Example1's input has 6s and 0s, and the output has 6s and 0s in different positions. Example3 has 2s and 0s.\n\nMaybe the transformation involves rotating the entire matrix 180 degrees, but with modifications. For example, example2's input, when rotated 180 degrees, would have the rows reversed and each row reversed. Let's see:\n\nInput example2:\n\n[0,0,9]\n\n[0,0,9]\n\n[9,9,9]\n\nRotate 180: reverse the order of the rows and reverse each row.\n\nSo reversed rows are [9,9,9], [0,0,9], [0,0,9]. Then reverse each row: [9,9,9], [9,0,0], [9,0,0]. Which doesn't match the output. Output is [9,9,9], [0,0,9], [0,0,9]. So not a 180 rotation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is to reverse each row and then shift the rows down. For example, in example2:\n\nReverse each row of input:\n\n[9,0,0], [9,0,0], [9,9,9]\n\nThen shift rows down: last row becomes first. So output:\n\n[9,9,9], [9,0,0], [9,0,0]. But the output is [9,9,9], [0,0,9], [0,0,9]. So that's not it.\n\nHmm. I'm running out of ideas. Let's try to look for a pattern that works for all examples.\n\nLooking at example3:\n\nInput:\n\nRow0: [2,0,2]\n\nRow1: [0,0,2]\n\nRow2: [0,2,2]\n\nOutput:\n\nRow0: [2,2,2]\n\nRow1: [0,0,2]\n\nRow2: [2,0,0]\n\nRow0: all elements are 2. So perhaps replace all 0s with 2. Which fits. Row0's input has a 0 \u2192 replaced with 2.\n\nRow2's input is [0,2,2] \u2192 output [2,0,0]. So 0s replaced with 2 in first position, but others are 0. This doesn't fit. Unless the rule is to replace 0s with the first element of the row.\n\nRow0's first element is 2. Replace 0 with 2 \u2192 becomes [2,2,2].\n\nRow2's first element is 0. So replace 0s with 0? But output is [2,0,0]. So maybe the first element is replaced with 2 (from somewhere else), then replace 0s with that. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, for each row, replace 0s with the value of the first non-zero element in that row.\n\nIn example3's row0, first non-zero is 2. Replace 0s with 2 \u2192 [2,2,2].\n\nRow1: first non-zero is 2 (third element). Replace 0s with 2 \u2192 [2,2,2]. But output row1 is [0,0,2]. Doesn't match.\n\nHmm.\n\nAnother pattern: For each row in the input, the output row is formed by taking the first element of the row, then adding the last element of the previous row, and other elements are 0. But this is speculative.\n\nIn example0:\n\nRow0's output is [0,9,9]. Previous row (assuming cyclic) would be row2's last element, which is 9. So first element is 0, others 9? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the output for each row is the first element of the row followed by the first element of the previous row and the first element of the next row. Doesn't make sense.\n\nThis is really tricky. Let's try to summarize what I've observed:\n\n- In example0, the first two rows have their first elements set to 0, and the rest of the elements are 9.\n\n- In example1, the first elements of the rows are kept as 6, 6, 6, and other elements are set to 0 or 6.\n\n- In example2, the third row becomes the first, and the other rows are moved down.\n\n- In example3, the first row's 0 is replaced by 2, and the third row's elements are reversed and replaced.\n\nBut these observations don't point to a single pattern. It's possible that the transformation is different for each example, but the problem states there's a single pattern.\n\nWait, maybe the pattern is that the output is created by rotating each row to the left by one position, then setting the first element to 0. Let's test this:\n\nExample0 row0: [9,0,0] \u2192 rotated left \u2192 [0,0,9]. Set first element to 0 \u2192 [0,0,9]. But output is [0,9,9]. Doesn't match.\n\nAnother possibility: Rotate each row to the right by one position, then set the last element to 9.\n\nExample0 row0: [9,0,0] \u2192 rotated right \u2192 [0,9,0]. Set last element to 9 \u2192 [0,9,9]. Which matches. Row1: [9,9,9] \u2192 rotated right \u2192 [9,9,9]. Set last to 9 \u2192 no change. But output row1 is [0,9,9]. So the first element must be set to 0. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, rotate right and set first element to 0. For row0: rotated right [0,9,0], set first to 0 \u2192 [0,9,0]. Doesn't match output [0,9,9].\n\nHmm.\n\nAnother idea: For each row, if the row contains a 0, then replace all elements except the first with 9. If the row has no zeros, replace the first element with 0.\n\nExample0 row0: has zeros \u2192 replace non-first elements with 9 \u2192 [9,9,9], then set first to 0 \u2192 [0,9,9]. Correct.\n\nRow1: has no zeros \u2192 replace first element with 0 \u2192 [0,9,9]. Correct.\n\nRow2: no zeros \u2192 replace first element with 0 \u2192 [0,9,9], but output row2 is unchanged. So this doesn't fit.\n\nExample1 row0: no zeros \u2192 replace first element with 0 \u2192 [0,6,6]. But output is [6,0,0]. So no.\n\nHmm.\n\nAnother possible pattern: For each row, replace all zeros with the row's first element. Then set the first element to 0.\n\nExample0 row0: [9,0,0] \u2192 replace zeros with 9 \u2192 [9,9,9] \u2192 set first to 0 \u2192 [0,9,9]. Correct.\n\nRow1: [9,9,9] \u2192 no zeros \u2192 set first to 0 \u2192 [0,9,9]. Correct.\n\nRow2: [9,9,9] \u2192 set first to 0 \u2192 [0,9,9], but output is [9,9,9]. So this doesn't fit. So this rule works for the first two rows but not the third. Maybe the rule applies only to rows that have at least one zero. So rows with no zeros remain unchanged.\n\nIn example0, row2 has no zeros, so it remains. Example1's row0 has no zeros, so replace first to 0. But example1's row0 output is [6,0,0]. So this doesn't fit.\n\nExample3's row0: [2,0,2] \u2192 replace zeros with 2 \u2192 [2,2,2] \u2192 set first to 0 \u2192 [0,2,2]. But output row0 is [2,2,2]. So this doesn't fit.\n\nSo this pattern works for some rows but not others.\n\nAt this point, I'm not able to identify the exact pattern. Perhaps I should look for another angle. Let's look at the test input and see if applying possible transformations from the examples might give a clue.\n\nTest input:\n\n[0, 0, 0]\n\n[5, 0, 0]\n\n[0, 5, 5]\n\nIf the pattern is similar to example2, where the rows are vertically flipped, then the output would be:\n\n[0,5,5]\n\n[5,0,0]\n\n[0,0,0]\n\nBut I need to check if that fits any of the examples' patterns. Example2's output was a vertical flip, but other examples didn't. So maybe the pattern is vertical flipping when certain conditions are met. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, applying the rule from example0 and example2 where zeros are replaced with the first element of the row and then the first element is set to 0. For the test input:\n\nRow0: [0,0,0]. Replace zeros with first element (0) \u2192 [0,0,0]. Set first to 0 \u2192 [0,0,0].\n\nRow1: [5,0,0]. Replace zeros with 5 \u2192 [5,5,5]. Set first to 0 \u2192 [0,5,5].\n\nRow2: [0,5,5]. Replace zeros with 0 (since first element is 0) \u2192 [0,5,5]. Set first to 0 \u2192 [0,5,5].\n\nBut the output would be:\n\n[0,0,0]\n\n[0,5,5]\n\n[0,5,5]\n\nBut I'm not sure if this matches any pattern from the examples. However, looking at example3's input and output, this approach doesn't work, so this is likely incorrect.\n\nAnother approach for the test input: Apply vertical flip. The test input rows are:\n\n0,0,0\n\n5,0,0\n\n0,5,5\n\nFlipping vertically would give:\n\n0,5,5\n\n5,0,0\n\n0,0,0\n\nWhich is possible. Let's see if any example follows this pattern. Example2's input and output fit vertical flip, but others don't. So maybe for the test input, the answer is the vertical flip. But I need to verify.\n\nAlternatively, the output could be the vertical flip with some modifications. But I'm not confident.\n\nAlternatively, considering that in example0, the output's first two rows start with 0, which is the first element of the input's row0, but not sure.\n\nGiven that I'm stuck, perhaps the best approach is to look for the pattern that seems to fit the majority of examples and apply it to the test input.\n\nExample0, example1, example2, and example3 have different transformations. The common thread might be that the output is the input with each row shifted right by one and the first element set to 0. But example0's row0 would become [0,9,0], which doesn't match the output [0,9,9]. So this isn't correct.\n\nAlternatively, shifting each row to the right and filling the new first element with 0. For example0's row0: [9,0,0] shifted right \u2192 [0,9,0]. But output is [0,9,9]. Doesn't fit.\n\nAnother possibility: Each row is reversed, then the first element is set to 0. Example0's row0 reversed is [0,0,9]. Set first to 0 \u2192 [0,0,9]. Doesn't match output [0,9,9].\n\nHmm. Given the time I've spent and lack of progress, I'll take a guess based on example2 and test input.\n\nIn example2, the output is the vertical flip of the input. Applying that to the test input:\n\nOriginal rows:\n\n[0,0,0]\n\n[5,0,0]\n\n[0,5,5]\n\nFlipping vertically:\n\n[0,5,5]\n\n[5,0,0]\n\n[0,0,0]\n\nBut let's see if this fits any of the training examples' patterns.\n\nExample0's vertical flip would be:\n\n[9,9,9]\n\n[9,9,9]\n\n[9,0,0]\n\nWhich is not the output. So vertical flip doesn't fit example0.\n\nBut example2's output is the vertical flip. So perhaps the pattern is vertical flip for inputs where the third row has all the same elements. Example0's third row is [9,9,9], which when flipped would stay the same. But the output's third row is the same. So maybe for such cases, the rows are flipped. But this is speculative.\n\nGiven the test input's third row is [0,5,5], which is not all the same. So vertical flipping might not apply. \n\nAlternatively, if the third row is all the same, then vertical flip, else some other transformation.\n\nBut without a clear pattern, I'm struggling. Since the answer requires applying the pattern, and the training examples don't have a clear common pattern I can discern, I'll make an educated guess based on example2's vertical flip and example3's row reversal.\n\nThe test input's output might be:\n\n[0,5,5]\n\n[5,0,0]\n\n[0,0,0]\n\nBut I'm not certain. However, looking back at example3's input and output, the third row in the input becomes the first row in the output, but modified. So maybe the third row moves to the top, and the others shift down. For the test input:\n\nOriginal rows:\n\nRow0: [0,0,0]\n\nRow1: [5,0,0]\n\nRow2: [0,5,5]\n\nShifting rows down once (third row becomes first):\n\nRow0: [0,5,5]\n\nRow1: [0,0,0]\n\nRow2: [5,0,0]\n\nBut the output in this case would be:\n\n[0,5,5]\n\n[0,0,0]\n\n[5,0,0]\n\nWhich doesn't match any pattern. But example2's output had the third row moved to the top. So perhaps the pattern is to reverse the row order. So for the test input, the output would be:\n\n[0,5,5]\n\n[5,0,0]\n\n[0,0,0]\n\nBut I need to check if this fits any of the examples. Example2's output fits this, but others don't. Example0's input, when reversed, would have the third row first, which is [9,9,9], then the second row [9,9,9], then first row [9,0,0]. But the actual output is different. So this is inconsistent.\n\nGiven the time I've invested without success, I'll proceed with the vertical flip guess for the test input.",

        "cot_2": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. So, looking at the training examples, each input is a 3x3 grid of numbers, and the output is another 3x3 grid. My job is to find out how the input is transformed into the output.\n\nLet me start by examining the first example, Example 0. The input is:\n\n[9, 0, 0]\n[9, 9, 9]\n[9, 9, 9]\n\nAnd the output is:\n\n[0, 9, 9]\n[0, 9, 9]\n[9, 9, 9]\n\nHmm. Let me compare each row. The first row in the input is [9,0,0], which becomes [0,9,9]. So the first element is swapped with the second, or maybe there's a reversal? Wait, reversing [9,0,0] would be [0,0,9], but the output is [0,9,9]. That doesn't fit. Maybe a rotation? Let's check.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each row is being shifted in some way. Let's look at the other examples.\n\nExample 1 input:\n\n[6,6,6]\n[0,0,0]\n[6,6,0]\n\nOutput:\n\n[6,0,0]\n[6,0,6]\n[6,0,6]\n\nLooking at the first input row [6,6,6] becomes [6,0,0]. The second input row [0,0,0] becomes [6,0,6]. Third input row [6,6,0] becomes [6,0,6]. Hmm, not sure. Maybe it's about moving zeros or other numbers to certain positions.\n\nWait, perhaps there's a pattern where each row in the output is formed by taking the elements from the corresponding column of the input, but rotated or transformed in some way. Let me think.\n\nAnother approach: maybe the output is a rotated version of the input. For example, rotating the matrix 90 degrees. Let's check Example 0.\n\nOriginal input for Example 0:\n\nRow 0: [9,0,0]\nRow 1: [9,9,9]\nRow 2: [9,9,9]\n\nIf we rotate 90 degrees clockwise, the first column becomes the last row in reverse. Let's see:\n\nOriginal columns:\n\nCol0: 9,9,9 \u2192 reversed would be 9,9,9 \u2192 becomes row 2 (output's last row is [9,9,9], which matches). Then col1: 0,9,9 \u2192 reversed would be 9,9,0 \u2192 but output row 1 is [0,9,9]. That doesn't match. So maybe not a simple rotation.\n\nWait, in Example 0's output, the first two rows are [0,9,9] and [0,9,9], and the last is same as input. Maybe the transformation is applied to certain parts of the matrix. Let me look for another pattern.\n\nAnother idea: Maybe each row is being shifted to the right, and the element that's shifted out wraps around to the left? For example, in Example 0's first input row [9,0,0], shifting right once would give [0,9,0], but the output is [0,9,9]. That's not matching. Alternatively, maybe shifting elements in a different way.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is that each row in the output is the previous row's elements in a certain order. Let's check.\n\nIn Example 0, the output's first row is [0,9,9]. The input's first row is [9,0,0]. Maybe the output row is the next row's elements. Wait, input's second row is [9,9,9], but output's first row is [0,9,9]. Not sure.\n\nLooking at Example 2:\n\nInput:\n[0,0,9]\n[0,0,9]\n[9,9,9]\n\nOutput:\n[9,9,9]\n[0,0,9]\n[0,0,9]\n\nSo the output here is the input rows reversed. The first row of input becomes the third in the output, second becomes second, third becomes first. Wait no, the input rows are row0, row1, row2. Output rows are row0 (input row2), row1 (input row1), row2 (input row0). Wait, no. Original input rows are:\n\n0: [0,0,9]\n\n1: [0,0,9]\n\n2: [9,9,9]\n\nOutput is:\n\n0: [9,9,9]\n\n1: [0,0,9]\n\n2: [0,0,9]\n\nSo the output is the input rows reversed. So row0 of output is input row2, row1 is input row1, row2 is input row0. But in Example 0, the output rows are [0,9,9], [0,9,9], [9,9,9]. The input rows are [9,0,0], [9,9,9], [9,9,9]. Reversed would be [9,9,9], [9,9,9], [9,0,0], which doesn't match. So maybe that's not the case.\n\nAnother thought: Maybe each column is being shifted down. For example, in Example 0, input columns are:\n\nColumn0: 9,9,9 \u2192 output column0:0,0,9. Hmm, shifting down by one. Original column0 elements 9,9,9. If shifted down once, the first element becomes the last, so [9,9,9] shifted down would be [9,9,9], which doesn't match the output column0 [0,0,9]. So not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each column is reversed. Let's check Example 0. Input columns:\n\nColumn0:9,9,9 \u2192 reversed would be 9,9,9. Output column0 is 0,0,9. Doesn't match. So no.\n\nLooking at Example 3's input and output:\n\nInput:\n\n[2,0,2]\n\n[0,0,2]\n\n[0,2,2]\n\nOutput:\n\n[2,2,2]\n\n[0,0,2]\n\n[2,0,0]\n\nHmm. The first row of output is [2,2,2]. Input's first row is [2,0,2]. Maybe combining elements from different rows. For example, the output first row's elements are the third row's elements in reverse? Third input row is [0,2,2], reversed is [2,2,0], but output's first row is [2,2,2]. Not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each element in the output is determined by some operation on the input elements. For example, the maximum or minimum of the column or row. Let's check Example 0.\n\nIn Example 0's output first row is [0,9,9]. The input's first column is 9,9,9. The max is 9, but the output's first element is 0. That doesn't fit. Maybe sum modulo something? Not sure.\n\nAnother angle: Maybe the transformation is related to moving zeros. Let's look at where zeros are in input and output.\n\nIn Example 0's input, the first row has two zeros. In the output, the first row's first element is zero, and the other two are 9. So maybe zeros are moving to the left? Like, the zeros in the input are shifted left. Wait, the input's first row is [9,0,0]. If we shift non-zero elements to the right, then zeros to the left, but that would give [0,0,9]. But the output is [0,9,9]. Hmm. Not exactly.\n\nWait, perhaps the transformation is that each row is reversed, and then some operation is applied. Let's check Example 0. Input first row reversed is [0,0,9]. The output is [0,9,9]. Not matching. Example 1's input first row reversed is [6,6,6], output first row is [6,0,0]. Doesn't match.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's a rotation of each individual element. For example, each element is rotated 180 degrees, but that doesn't make sense here.\n\nWait, maybe it's a reflection across some axis. For example, flipping the matrix horizontally or vertically. Let's check Example 2's input and output. Input:\n\n[0,0,9]\n\n[0,0,9]\n\n[9,9,9]\n\nOutput:\n\n[9,9,9]\n\n[0,0,9]\n\n[0,0,9]\n\nSo the output is the input matrix flipped vertically. Because flipping the rows in reverse order. Original rows 0,1,2 become 2,1,0. But in the output, row0 is input's row2, row1 is input row1, row2 is input row0. That's exactly vertical flipping. But in Example 0, the input is:\n\n[9,0,0]\n\n[9,9,9]\n\n[9,9,9]\n\nFlipping vertically would result in:\n\n[9,9,9]\n\n[9,9,9]\n\n[9,0,0]\n\nBut the output is:\n\n[0,9,9]\n\n[0,9,9]\n\n[9,9,9]\n\nWhich doesn't match. So vertical flipping applies to Example 2 but not others. So perhaps the pattern isn't consistent. So maybe vertical flipping is part of the solution but not the entire pattern.\n\nWait, looking at Example 3's input and output. Input is:\n\nRow0: [2,0,2]\n\nRow1: [0,0,2]\n\nRow2: [0,2,2]\n\nOutput is:\n\n[2,2,2]\n\n[0,0,2]\n\n[2,0,0]\n\nIf we flip vertically, the output would have input's row2 as output row0. Input row2 is [0,2,2], but output row0 is [2,2,2]. Doesn't match. So vertical flipping isn't the answer here.\n\nLet me try another approach. Let's look at the position of elements. For each position (i,j) in the output, where does the value come from in the input?\n\nTake Example 0:\n\nInput:\n\nRow0: [9, 0, 0]\n\nRow1: [9,9,9]\n\nRow2: [9,9,9]\n\nOutput:\n\nRow0: [0,9,9]\n\nRow1: [0,9,9]\n\nRow2: [9,9,9]\n\nLooking at output's (0,0) is 0. Input's (0,0) is 9. So not same position. Maybe output (i,j) comes from input (j,i) in some rotated way. Let's see:\n\nOriginal input's transpose would be:\n\nRow0:9,9,9\n\nRow1:0,9,9\n\nRow2:0,9,9\n\nBut the output of Example0 is:\n\nRow0:0,9,9\n\nRow1:0,9,9\n\nRow2:9,9,9\n\nHmm. So the transpose of the input would have the same first column as 9,0,0. But output's first column is 0,0,9. Not matching.\n\nAnother thought: Maybe each row is shifted in a certain way. Let's see. In Example0, the first input row is [9,0,0]. Output first row is [0,9,9]. So perhaps shifting left once, but the 9 moves to the end. Shifting left once would give [0,0,9], but output is [0,9,9]. Not matching. Shifting right once would give [0,9,0], which is also not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each element is replaced by the element below it. For example, in Example0, output row0 is [0,9,9], which could be the elements from input row1. Input row1 is [9,9,9], but output row0 is [0,9,9]. So the first element is 0, which doesn't come from input row1.\n\nHmm. Maybe I need to look for a pattern that combines multiple transformations.\n\nLooking at Example3:\n\nInput:\n\nRow0: [2,0,2]\n\nRow1: [0,0,2]\n\nRow2: [0,2,2]\n\nOutput:\n\nRow0: [2,2,2]\n\nRow1: [0,0,2]\n\nRow2: [2,0,0]\n\nSo output row0 is [2,2,2], which could be the elements from the third column of input. Input third column is 2,2,2. So output row0 is that column. Then output row1 is [0,0,2], which is the second column of input: 0,0,2. Output row2 is [2,0,0], which is the first column of input: 2,0,0. So this looks like the transpose of the input matrix. Because the transpose of the input would be:\n\nRow0 (from input column0):2,0,0\n\nRow1 (input column1):0,0,2\n\nRow2 (input column2):2,2,2\n\nBut the output is:\n\nRow0:2,2,2\n\nRow1:0,0,2\n\nRow2:2,0,0\n\nSo the output rows are the input columns but in reverse order. Input columns as rows are [2,0,0], [0,0,2], [2,2,2]. But output rows are [2,2,2], [0,0,2], [2,0,0]. So it's the transpose of the input matrix but reversed in row order. So first the input is transposed, then the rows are reversed.\n\nLet's check that. Transposing the input of Example3:\n\nOriginal input:\n\nRow0:2,0,2\n\nRow1:0,0,2\n\nRow2:0,2,2\n\nTranspose (columns become rows):\n\nRow0:2,0,0\n\nRow1:0,0,2\n\nRow2:2,2,2\n\nThen reversing the row order of the transposed matrix gives:\n\nRow0:2,2,2\n\nRow1:0,0,2\n\nRow2:2,0,0\n\nWhich matches the output of Example3. So that's promising. Let's check if this pattern holds for the other examples.\n\nTake Example0:\n\nInput:\n\n[9,0,0]\n\n[9,9,9]\n\n[9,9,9]\n\nTransposing this would make each column a row:\n\nRow0:9,9,9\n\nRow1:0,9,9\n\nRow2:0,9,9\n\nThen reversing the row order of the transposed matrix:\n\nRow0:0,9,9 (original row2 of transposed)\n\nRow1:0,9,9 (original row1)\n\nRow2:9,9,9 (original row0)\n\nWhich matches the output of Example0:\n\n[0,9,9]\n\n[0,9,9]\n\n[9,9,9]\n\nYes! So Example0's output is the transpose of the input, then reverse the rows.\n\nExample1:\n\nInput:\n\n[6,6,6]\n\n[0,0,0]\n\n[6,6,0]\n\nTranspose:\n\nRow0:6,0,6\n\nRow1:6,0,6\n\nRow2:6,0,0\n\nReverse the rows:\n\nRow0:6,0,0\n\nRow1:6,0,6\n\nRow2:6,0,6\n\nWhich matches the output of Example1:\n\n[6,0,0]\n\n[6,0,6]\n\n[6,0,6]\n\nYes! So that works.\n\nExample2:\n\nInput:\n\n[0,0,9]\n\n[0,0,9]\n\n[9,9,9]\n\nTranspose:\n\nRow0:0,0,9\n\nRow1:0,0,9\n\nRow2:9,9,9\n\nReversing rows:\n\nRow0:9,9,9\n\nRow1:0,0,9\n\nRow2:0,0,9\n\nWhich matches Example2's output.\n\nSo the pattern seems to be: transpose the input matrix (rows become columns and vice versa) and then reverse the order of the rows. So the output is the transpose of the input matrix, then the rows are reversed.\n\nLet me confirm this with Example3:\n\nInput:\n\n[2,0,2]\n\n[0,0,2]\n\n[0,2,2]\n\nTranspose:\n\nRow0:2,0,0\n\nRow1:0,0,2\n\nRow2:2,2,2\n\nReverse rows:\n\nRow0:2,2,2\n\nRow1:0,0,2\n\nRow2:2,0,0\n\nWhich matches the output of Example3.\n\nSo the general pattern is:\n\n1. Transpose the matrix (rows become columns, columns become rows).\n\n2. Reverse the order of the rows in the transposed matrix.\n\nSo the steps are: first transpose, then reverse the row order.\n\nNow, applying this to the test input:\n\nTest Input:\n\n[0,0,0]\n\n[5,0,0]\n\n[0,5,5]\n\nLet's apply the transformation.\n\nStep1: Transpose the input matrix.\n\nOriginal input rows:\n\nRow0: [0,0,0]\n\nRow1: [5,0,0]\n\nRow2: [0,5,5]\n\nTransposing the matrix (columns become rows):\n\nOriginal columns are:\n\nColumn0: 0,5,0 \u2192 becomes Row0: [0,5,0]\n\nColumn1: 0,0,5 \u2192 becomes Row1: [0,0,5]\n\nColumn2:0,0,5 \u2192 becomes Row2: [0,0,5]\n\nSo transposed matrix is:\n\nRow0: [0,5,0]\n\nRow1: [0,0,5]\n\nRow2: [0,0,5]\n\nStep2: Reverse the order of the rows.\n\nOriginal transposed rows:\n\nRow0: [0,5,0]\n\nRow1: [0,0,5]\n\nRow2: [0,0,5]\n\nReversing the rows gives:\n\nNew Row0: [0,0,5] (original Row2)\n\nNew Row1: [0,0,5] (original Row1)\n\nNew Row2: [0,5,0] (original Row0)\n\nSo the output matrix should be:\n\n[0,0,5]\n\n[0,0,5]\n\n[0,5,0]\n\nLet me check if this matches the format. Each row should be in brackets. Let me write it properly:\n\nOUTPUT:\n\n[0, 0, 5]\n\n[0, 0, 5]\n\n[0, 5, 0]\n\nYes. So that's the expected output."
