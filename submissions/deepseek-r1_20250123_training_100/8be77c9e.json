        "cot_1": "Okay, let's look at these examples and try to figure out the pattern. So, each input is a 3x3 grid (3 rows), and the output is a 6x3 grid. The output seems to be the original input followed by some transformation.\n\nLooking at Example 0:\nInput:\n[1,1,0]\n[1,1,1]\n[0,0,0]\n\nOutput:\nSame as input for first 3 rows, then the next three rows are [0,0,0], [1,1,1], [1,1,0]. Wait, that's the original third row, then second, then first? So the original input is mirrored vertically? Like flipping the rows in reverse order. So after the original input, they append the reversed input rows. Let's check that.\n\nOriginal input rows 0,1,2. Appended rows would be 2,1,0. So in example 0, the input's rows are [1,1,0], [1,1,1], [0,0,0]. Appended rows would be [0,0,0], [1,1,1], [1,1,0], which matches the output. So the output is the original input followed by the reversed input rows.\n\nCheck Example 1:\nInput rows:\n0: [0,0,0]\n1: [1,0,1]\n2: [1,1,0]\n\nReversed rows would be row 2, row 1, row 0:\n[1,1,0], [1,0,1], [0,0,0]. The output is input + reversed, which matches. So the output is the original input followed by the reverse of the input rows.\n\nExample 2:\nInput:\n[0,0,0]\n[0,0,1]\n[0,0,1]\n\nReversed rows would be [0,0,1], [0,0,1], [0,0,0]. So output is original plus reversed, which matches.\n\nSo the pattern is take the input grid (3 rows) and then append the reverse of those rows. So for the test input, let's see:\n\nTest Input:\n[0,0,0]\n[0,0,1]\n[1,0,0]\n\nReversed rows would be [1,0,0], [0,0,1], [0,0,0]. So the output should be the original three rows followed by these reversed three rows. Let's check that.\n\nOriginal rows:\nRow0: [0,0,0]\nRow1: [0,0,1]\nRow2: [1,0,0]\n\nAppended reversed rows:\nRow3: [1,0,0]\nRow4: [0,0,1]\nRow5: [0,0,0]\n\nPutting it all together, the output should be the original three rows followed by the reversed three rows. Let's verify with the examples again to make sure. Yes, that seems correct.",

        "cot_2": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. So, looking at the training examples, each input is a 3x3 grid? Wait, no, the inputs are three lists each of three elements. Then the outputs are six lists. So the output is twice the length of the input. Let me check.\n\nIn Example 0, the input has three rows, and the output has six rows. The first three rows of the output are the same as the input. Then the next three rows are the original input reversed. Wait, but reversed in what way? Let me look:\n\nOriginal input for Example 0:\n[1,1,0]\n[1,1,1]\n[0,0,0]\n\nOutput is:\nSame as input first three rows, then [0,0,0], [1,1,1], [1,1,0]. Oh, right! So the last three rows are the original input's rows in reverse order. So input rows 3, 2, 1 become the next three rows. So row 3 becomes row 4, row 2 becomes row 5, row 1 becomes row 6? Wait, let me see:\n\nOriginal input rows are row0, row1, row2. The output appends row2, row1, row0. So for example 0, the original rows are:\n\nRow0: [1,1,0]\n\nRow1: [1,1,1]\n\nRow2: [0,0,0]\n\nThen the output after the original rows adds row2, row1, row0. So the output is the original followed by the reverse of the original rows.\n\nLet's check Example 1:\n\nInput:\n[0,0,0] (row0)\n[1,0,1] (row1)\n[1,1,0] (row2)\n\nOutput:\nSame three rows, then row2, row1, row0 again. So output is:\n\n[0,0,0]\n\n[1,0,1]\n\n[1,1,0]\n\nThen [1,1,0], [1,0,1], [0,0,0]. Which matches the example's output. So that seems to fit.\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput rows:\n\nrow0: [0,0,0]\n\nrow1: [0,0,1]\n\nrow2: [0,0,1]\n\nOutput is those three, then row2, row1, row0. Wait, but row2 and row1 are the same in the input. So output rows 3,4,5 are [0,0,1], [0,0,1], [0,0,0], which is exactly the reverse of the input rows. So the pattern is to append the reverse of the input rows to the original input.\n\nSo the transformation is: take the input as a list of rows, then append the reverse of the list of rows. So the output is input + reversed(input), but reversed as a list. For example, if input is A, B, C, output is A, B, C, C, B, A.\n\nSo for the test input:\n\nTest Input:\n[0,0,0] (row0)\n[0,0,1] (row1)\n[1,0,0] (row2)\n\nFollowing the same pattern, the output should be the original three rows followed by reversed rows. So reversed list is row2, row1, row0. So the output should be:\n\nOriginal rows:\n\n[0,0,0]\n\n[0,0,1]\n\n[1,0,0]\n\nThen reversed rows:\n\n[1,0,0]\n\n[0,0,1]\n\n[0,0,0]\n\nSo combining them, the output is:\n\n[0,0,0]\n\n[0,0,1]\n\n[1,0,0]\n\n[1,0,0]\n\n[0,0,1]\n\n[0,0,0]\n\nWhich matches the structure of the training examples. Let me check again to be sure. Each output is the input followed by the reverse of the input's row order. Yes, that seems consistent across all examples."
