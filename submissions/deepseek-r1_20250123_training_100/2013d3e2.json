        "cot_1": "Okay, let's see. I need to figure out the pattern that transforms the input grids into the output grids in the training examples, then apply that to the test input. Let me start by looking closely at the examples provided.\n\nFirst, let's take Example 0. The input is a 10x10 grid. The output is a 3x3 grid. So the output is smaller. How does the input become the output? Let me look at the numbers.\n\nIn the input of Example 0, the non-zero numbers form a sort of diamond or symmetrical pattern. The center seems to be around the middle rows and columns. The output is three rows, each with three elements. The middle of the output is 4, surrounded by 8s and 7s, etc.\n\nLooking at the positions in the input:\n\nFor the output's first row [0,0,7], maybe these are taken from specific positions in the input. Let's check the input's rows. The third row (index 2) of the input is [0, 0, 0, 0, 7,7, 0,0,0,0]. The output's first row is [0,0,7]. Hmm. Wait, the output's first element is 0, second 0, third 7. Maybe taking elements from the middle of certain rows.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the central 3x3 part of some transformation. But the input has a larger structure. Another approach: the output might be taking the central elements of each layer or something like that.\n\nWait, let's look at the input's structure. The input grid seems to have layers. For example, the numbers 7, 6, 8, 4 are arranged in a concentric pattern. The output in Example 0 is:\n\n[0,0,7]\n[0,6,8]\n[7,8,4]\n\nThis looks like the center part of the input. Let me check the input's rows. The center rows are rows 4,5 (assuming 0-based indexing). Row 4 in input is [0,0,7,8,4,4,8,7,0,0]. The middle elements here are 8,4,4,8. Hmm, but the output's third row is [7,8,4]. Wait, maybe the output is taking the central 3x3 from the input but with some offset or transformation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is taking the middle three elements from certain rows. For example, in the input's row 2 (third row), the non-zero elements start at positions 4 and 5 (7s). The output's first row has 7 as the third element. Maybe each row of the output is taking the middle three elements from specific rows in the input.\n\nWait, let's look at the positions:\n\nLooking at the input grid in Example 0, the output's first row [0,0,7] could be from row 2 (third row) columns 4,5,6? But row 2 in input is [0,0,0,0,7,7,0,0,0,0]. Columns 4 and 5 are 7,7, column 6 is 0. So 7,7,0. But the output's first row is 0,0,7. That doesn't match. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's taking the first three non-zero elements from certain rows. But the output's first row in example 0 is [0,0,7]. Maybe the output is the 3x3 center of the input, but the input is 10x10. Wait, 10x10's center would be around rows 4-6 and columns 4-6. Let's see:\n\nRow 2 (third row) in input has 7s at columns 4 and 5. The output's first row is [0,0,7]. Maybe looking at a specific part. Alternatively, maybe each row of the output is taken from the middle of each \"ring\" in the input.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is a 3x3 grid taken from the input's center, but the input is larger. Let me check the positions:\n\nIn Example 0's input, the 3x3 output's elements are:\n\nRow 0: 0,0,7 \u2192 maybe from input row 2, columns 4,5,6? But input row 2's columns 4-6 are 7,7,0. That would be 7,7,0. But output is 0,0,7. That doesn't align. Hmm.\n\nLooking at the output's second row [0,6,8]. Let's see input row 3 (fourth row) is [0,0,0,6,8,8,6,0,0,0]. Columns 3-5 are 6,8,8. If we take columns 4-6, maybe 8,8,6. But output is 0,6,8. Wait, perhaps the output is taking the central three elements of certain rows. For row 3, the middle elements are around columns 4-6, but the row is [6,8,8,6], so the middle would be 8,8. But the output's second row is 0,6,8. Hmm, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is constructed from the first three rows of the input's non-zero elements. Wait, no. Let's think differently.\n\nIn Example 0's output:\n\nThe first row is 0,0,7. The input's row 2 (third row) has 7s in columns 4 and 5. So maybe in row 2, column 5 is 7. The output's third element is 7. Then the first two are 0. Maybe taking column 5, 6, 7? No. Let's try to look for a pattern in how the output is formed.\n\nLooking at Example 1's input and output. The output is:\n\n[1,0,0]\n[0,3,6]\n[0,5,2]\n\nThe input's first row is all zeros except row 1 (second row) has 1s at columns 1 and 6. The output's first row is [1,0,0]. Maybe that comes from row 1 of the input. Let's check. Row 1 of the input is [0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0]. So the elements are 0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0. The first three elements are 0,1,0. But the output's first row is [1,0,0]. Hmm, not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking elements from specific positions. Let's look for the positions of the elements in the output.\n\nIn Example 0's output:\n\nRow 0: 0,0,7 \u2192 perhaps from input row 2, column 6? Because in input row 2, columns 4 and 5 are 7,7. Wait, column 6 is 0. That doesn't make sense. Alternatively, maybe the output is a 3x3 grid centered at the central point of the input. For a 10x10 grid, the center would be between positions (4.5,4.5), so the central 3x3 would be rows 4-6 and columns 4-6. Let's check that.\n\nIn Example 0's input, rows 4-6:\n\nRow 4: 0,0,7,8,4,4,8,7,0,0 \u2192 columns 4-6 are 4,4,8 \u2192 but the output's third row is 7,8,4. Hmm, maybe not. Or maybe rotated.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is a cropped and rotated version. For example, take the center part and rotate it. Let's see.\n\nIn Example 0, the input's center has a structure like:\n\nRow 4: 7,8,4,4,8,7 (but in context of the row). Maybe the output is taking the top-left part of the center? Or perhaps the output is the central 3x3 but rotated 45 degrees. Wait, the output for example 0 looks like a diamond shape. The first row has 7, the second 6 and 8, third 8 and 4. Maybe it's taking elements from different layers. For instance, the outermost layer (7s), then inner layer (6 and 8), then the innermost (4). But how that maps to the 3x3 grid.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is formed by taking the maximum value in each ring around the center. But that might not fit.\n\nAnother approach: look for the positions of the output elements in the input.\n\nIn Example 0's output:\n\nFirst row: [0,0,7]. Let's see where 7 appears in the input. In row 2, columns 4 and 5 (0-based). Maybe the output's first row's third element is from row 2, column 5.\n\nSecond row of output: [0,6,8]. The 6 and 8 are in row 3, columns 3 and 4 (6 and 8). So maybe row 3, columns 3,4,5: 6,8,8 \u2192 but the output is 0,6,8. So perhaps taking columns 3,4,5 of row 3, but the first element is 0. Wait, input row 3: [0,0,0,6,8,8,6,0,0,0]. So columns 3 is 6, column4 is8, column5 is8. The output row2 is [0,6,8]. So maybe the first element is from a different row. Hmm, confusing.\n\nWait, maybe each row of the output is constructed from three different rows in the input. For example, the first row of the output takes elements from row 2, 3, and 4 of the input. Not sure.\n\nLooking at Example 1's output:\n\n[1,0,0]\n\n[0,3,6]\n\n[0,5,2]\n\nLooking at the input, the 1s are in row1 (second row) columns1 and6. The output's first row is 1,0,0. Maybe it's taking the first occurrence of non-zero in certain rows. For example, row1's first non-zero is at column1 (value 1). The output's first element is 1. Then row2's first non-zero is 3 (row2's third element). But output's second row starts with 0, then 3. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is a 3x3 grid taken from a specific part of the input. For instance, in Example1, the output's middle row is [0,3,6], which corresponds to input row2 (third row) elements 2,3,4: 3,6,5. But the output row2 is [0,3,6]. Wait, input row2 is [0,0,3,6,5,3,0,0,0,0]. So columns2-4 are 3,6,5. The output's second row is [0,3,6], which could be the elements from columns2,3,4. But the first element here is 3, not 0. So perhaps not.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is taking the non-zero elements from the center. But how?\n\nAnother idea: perhaps the output is the central 3x3 of the input, but after some rotation. For example, rotating the central part 45 degrees. Let me check.\n\nIn Example0's input, the central part (rows 4-6, columns4-6) would be:\n\nRow4: ... 4,4,8 ...\n\nWait, let me write out the central 3x3 of the input:\n\nRow4 (0-based index 4) of input Example0: [0,0,7,8,4,4,8,7,0,0]. So columns 4-6 are 4,4,8.\n\nRow5: same as row4.\n\nRow6: [0,0,0,6,8,8,6,0,0,0]. Columns4-6 are 8,8,6.\n\nWait, the central 3 rows and 3 columns would be:\n\nRow4: 4,4,8\n\nRow5:4,4,8\n\nRow6:8,8,6\n\nBut the output is:\n\n[0,0,7]\n\n[0,6,8]\n\n[7,8,4]\n\nThat doesn't match. So maybe not the central 3x3.\n\nAlternative approach: look at the positions of each element in the output and see where they are in the input.\n\nExample0's output first row, third element is 7. Looking at the input, the 7s are in rows 2 and 7, columns4-5. The output's third element in row0 is 7. So maybe that's row2, column5.\n\nOutput row1, second element is 6. In the input, 6 appears in row3, column3 and 6. So row3, column3 is 6.\n\nOutput row1, third element is 8. In input row3, column4 is 8.\n\nOutput row2, first element is7. Input row4, column2 is7.\n\nOutput row2, second element is8. Input row4, column3 is8.\n\nOutput row2, third element is4. Input row4, column4 is4.\n\nSo putting that together, the positions in the input for the output elements are:\n\n[ (row2, column5), (row3, column3), (row3, column4) ? Wait, no. Let me list each element:\n\nOutput row0: [0,0,7] \u2192 elements (0,0)=0, (0,1)=0, (0,2)=7.\n\nIf the third element (0,2) is 7, maybe it's from input row2, column5 (since input row2, columns4 and5 are 7s, but column5 is 7). But how does that fit into the output's indices.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output's elements are taken from the input in a specific pattern. For example, each element in the output is from a position that is (row + a, column + b) in the input. But I need to find a pattern.\n\nAlternatively, the output is the top-left 3x3 of the input after some transformation. Or perhaps the output is a zoomed-in view of the center, taking every other element.\n\nWait, perhaps the output is formed by taking the center elements of the input, but with some offset. Let me think about the input in example0. The non-zero elements form a diamond shape. The output seems to capture the three layers of the diamond. The first row of the output has 7 (outer layer), the second has 6 and 8 (middle layer), and the third has 8 and 4 (inner layer). So maybe each row of the output represents a different layer of the diamond, and the columns represent positions around the diamond.\n\nAlternatively, the output is a 3x3 grid that captures the three central layers of the diamond. The first row is the outermost layer (7s), the second row the middle (6 and 8), and the third row the innermost (4).\n\nBut how does this translate into their positions in the grid?\n\nAlternatively, the output could be the three middle elements from each of the three central layers. For example, in example0's input:\n\n- The outer layer (7s) is at rows2 and7, columns4-5. Taking the middle element (7) for the output's first row, third column.\n- The middle layer (6s and8s) are in rows3 and6, columns3-6. The middle elements would be 6 and8, but how they arrange into the output's second row.\n- The inner layer (4s) are in rows4-5, columns4-5. The middle element is4.\n\nBut I'm not sure how this forms the 3x3 output.\n\nAnother idea: the output is a 3x3 matrix where each row corresponds to a specific \"ring\" or \"level\" in the input's concentric pattern. For each ring, the output takes the top, middle, and bottom elements (or left, center, right) and arranges them into the output rows.\n\nAlternatively, think of the input as a diamond-shaped structure with multiple layers. The output captures three key points from each of three layers. For example:\n\n- The topmost point of the outermost layer (7) is at row2, column5. Then the next layer's top point (6) at row3, column4, and the innermost layer's top point (4) at row4, column4. But this doesn't directly map to the output's structure.\n\nAlternatively, each row in the output corresponds to a diagonal in the input. For instance:\n\nOutput row0: elements from (2,5), (3,4), (4,3) \u2192 but not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the output is a 3x3 grid where each cell is the sum or some operation of surrounding cells in the input. But I need to check.\n\nLet me compare the input and output of example0 again.\n\nInput's rows with non-zero elements:\n\nRow2: ...7,7...\n\nRow3: ...6,8,8,6...\n\nRow4:7,8,4,4,8,7...\n\nRow5: same as row4.\n\nRow6: same as row3.\n\nRow7: same as row2.\n\nSo the input is symmetric vertically and horizontally. The output is also symmetric. For example, the output's third row is [7,8,4], and if we mirror it, it's symmetric. The output's rows seem to be taking elements from the upper half of the input's diamond.\n\nAlternatively, the output is the central 3x3 of the input after being rotated 45 degrees. Let's imagine rotating the central part. If the input's diamond is considered as a rotated square, then taking the central 3x3 after rotating might give the output. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the output is formed by taking three consecutive elements from the middle of certain rows. For example:\n\nIn example0:\n\nOutput row0 is [0,0,7]. The input row2 has 7s in columns4 and5. Maybe taking columns5,6,7: which are 7,0,0. But the output row0 is [0,0,7], which is reversed. So maybe reversed. If so, then columns5,4,3: but row2's columns3 is 0. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each output row is the central three elements of a specific input row. For example:\n\nOutput row0: central three elements of input row2. Input row2's central (since it's 10 elements, the middle would be positions4-6: 7,7,0. The central three are 7,7,0. The output row0 is [0,0,7], which is reversed. So maybe reversed. 7,7,0 reversed is 0,7,7. Not matching. Hmm.\n\nAnother approach: look for the position of each element in the output grid within the input grid. Let's take example0's output elements and find their positions.\n\nOutput element at (0,2) is 7. Looking at input, this could be row2, column5 (value7).\n\nOutput element at (1,1) is6. Input row3, column3 (value6).\n\nOutput element at (1,2) is8. Input row3, column4 (value8).\n\nOutput element at (2,0) is7. Input row4, column2 (value7).\n\nOutput element at (2,1) is8. Input row4, column3 (value8).\n\nOutput element at (2,2) is4. Input row4, column4 (value4).\n\nNow, if these positions are mapped to the output's grid, perhaps the output is arranged such that each row in the output corresponds to a diagonal in the input. For example:\n\n- The first row of the output (0,0,7) includes elements from input row2, column5 (7).\n- Second row (0,6,8) includes elements from row3, column3 (6) and row3, column4 (8).\n- Third row (7,8,4) includes elements from row4, column2 (7), row4, column3 (8), row4, column4 (4).\n\nBut how are the positions in the output determined? Let's see:\n\nIn output, the positions are:\n\n(0,2) \u2192 7 (row2, column5)\n\n(1,1) \u21926 (row3, column3)\n\n(1,2) \u21928 (row3, column4)\n\n(2,0) \u21927 (row4, column2)\n\n(2,1) \u21928 (row4, column3)\n\n(2,2) \u21924 (row4, column4)\n\nLooking at these positions, the row in the input increases by 1 as we go down the output's rows. The columns in the input for each output element seem to start from higher columns and decrease. For example:\n\nOutput row0, column2: input column5.\n\nOutput row1, column1: input column3.\n\nOutput row1, column2: input column4.\n\nOutput row2, column0: input column2.\n\nOutput row2, column1: input column3.\n\nOutput row2, column2: input column4.\n\nThis seems a bit irregular, but maybe there's a pattern of the output columns being (input column - output row) or something. For instance, in output row0, column2: input column5. 5-0=5. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is formed by taking elements from the input in a diagonal manner. For example, output (0,2) is from row2, column5, output (1,1) from row3, column3, output (2,0) from row4, column2. So each step down a row in output moves the input row +1 and column -2. So from row2,5 to row3,3 (diff row+1, column-2), then to row4,1 (but in example0's output, row2, column0 is 7, which comes from row4, column2). Hmm, not matching.\n\nAlternatively, the output's elements are arranged such that each column in the output corresponds to a different 'ring' in the input's diamond structure. The first column captures the outermost ring, the middle column the next ring, and the last column the innermost.\n\nBut I'm not quite getting it. Let's look at example1.\n\nExample1's output is:\n\nRow0: [1,0,0]\n\nRow1: [0,3,6]\n\nRow2: [0,5,2]\n\nLooking at the input, the non-zero elements are in rows1,2,3,4,5,6. The output's first row has 1, which is from row1, column1 (input's row1 is [0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0], so element1 is 1. The output's first element is 1. Then, in row1 of the output, the second element is3, which could be from row2, column2 (input row2 is [0,0,3,6,5,3,0,0,0,0], column2 is3. Output row1, column1 is3. Then output row1, column2 is6, which is from row2, column3.\n\nOutput row2, column1 is5, which comes from input row3, column2 (input row3: [0,0,5,2,2,6,0,0,0,0], column2 is5. Output row2, column2 is2, from input row3, column3.\n\nSo in example1, the output seems to take elements from rows1,2,3, and columns1,2,3. Specifically:\n\nRow0 of output takes element from row1, column1 (1), and then zeros? Or perhaps the output is taking elements from the first three rows, but shifted.\n\nBut in example0, the output's elements come from rows2,3,4. So maybe the pattern is that the output is a 3x3 grid where each element (i,j) in the output corresponds to input row (center_row - 2 + i) and column (center_col - 2 + j), but adjusted in some way. But in example0, the center is at row4.5 (since 10 rows), column4.5. So perhaps the output is centered around row4, column5, or some other point.\n\nAlternatively, the output is formed by taking elements that are in the same positions relative to the center of the input. For example, in example0's input, the center is between rows4 and5, and columns4 and5. The output's elements are positioned around this center.\n\nFor example, the element7 in output row0, column2 could be to the right of the center. Element6 in row1, column1 could be left and down. Maybe there's a spiral or directional pattern.\n\nAlternatively, each row of the output represents a certain direction from the center. For example, up-right, middle, down-left, etc. But I'm not sure.\n\nWait, let's think about the positions in the input for example0's output:\n\nOutput element (0,2):7 is from row2, column5.\n\nOutput element (1,1):6 is from row3, column3.\n\nOutput element (2,0):7 is from row4, column2.\n\nSo, these positions form a diagonal from (2,5) to (4,2), moving down-left. Similarly, other elements may form other diagonals. But how this would form a 3x3 grid.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is formed by taking three diagonals from the input. For example, the main diagonal and two others. But I need more examples.\n\nAlternatively, considering the input is symmetrical, maybe the output is the top-left quadrant of the central part, but rotated or something. For example, the input's center is symmetric, and the output captures a quadrant that's been processed.\n\nAlternatively, the output is a 3x3 matrix where each element is the first occurrence of a new number in a specific direction. For example, starting from the center and moving outwards in a spiral, but it's unclear.\n\nAnother approach: compare the non-zero elements in the input and output. For example, in example0's input, the non-zero numbers are 7,6,8,4. The output contains 0,7,6,8,4. The zeros might indicate positions where no non-zero element exists in the corresponding area of the input.\n\nLooking at example0's output:\n\n[0,0,7]\n\n[0,6,8]\n\n[7,8,4]\n\nThe zeros are in positions where the input has zero. For example, the output's (0,0) is 0 because in the input's row2, column4 (the corresponding position?), there's a 7. Wait, maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, the output's rows correspond to certain rows in the input, and the columns correspond to certain columns. For example:\n\n- Output row0 is input row2, columns4-6: [7,7,0]. So reversed or shifted. But the output is [0,0,7]. If reversed, it's 0,7,7. Not matching.\n\nAlternatively, output row0 is input row2, columns5-7: [7,0,0]. Which matches the output's row0 third element as7 and others as0. So perhaps output row0 is columns5-7 of input row2. That gives [7,0,0], but the output's row0 is [0,0,7], which is reversed. So reversed.\n\nSimilarly, output row1: [0,6,8]. If we take input row3, columns3-5: [6,8,8], reversed would be 8,8,6. Not matching. But the output's row1 is [0,6,8]. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe columns3-5 of row3 are 6,8,8. The output is [0,6,8]. Maybe taking the first three elements of that row, but that's [0,0,0,6,8,8,...].\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output's rows are taken from specific rows in the input, but the columns are shifted. For example, row0 of output comes from input row2, starting at column5:7, then column6:0, then column7:0 \u2192 but that would be [7,0,0]. Reversed gives [0,0,7], which matches the output's row0.\n\nSimilarly, row1 of output comes from input row3, starting at column3:6, column4:8, column5:8 \u2192 [6,8,8]. But the output row1 is [0,6,8]. So maybe taking the first element from the left of the starting column. Not sure.\n\nRow2 of output: [7,8,4]. If we take input row4, starting at column2:7, column3:8, column4:4 \u2192 [7,8,4], which matches exactly. So for example0:\n\n- output row0 is reversed input row2, columns5-7 (7,0,0 \u2192 reversed to 0,0,7).\n\n- output row1 is input row3, columns3-5 (6,8,8) \u2192 but output is [0,6,8]. Doesn't match.\n\nWait, input row3 is [0,0,0,6,8,8,6,0,0,0]. columns3-5 are 6,8,8. So taking those three elements would give [6,8,8], but output row1 is [0,6,8]. So maybe shifted by one? Like columns4-6:8,8,6 \u2192 but output row1 is [0,6,8]. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output row1 is formed by taking the first element from the previous row. Like row3, column2 (0) followed by columns3-4 (6,8). So [0,6,8]. That matches the output row1.\n\nSimilarly, output row2 is row4, columns2-4:7,8,4. Which matches.\n\nSo the pattern could be:\n\nFor each output row i:\n\n- Take input row (2 + i), starting at column (5 - 2*i), then take three columns.\n\nFor example0:\n\n- output row0 (i=0): input row2 (2+0=2), column5 -0*2=5, columns5,6,7 \u2192 values 7,0,0 \u2192 reversed to 0,0,7.\n\n- output row1 (i=1): input row3 (2+1=3), column5-2*1=3. columns3,4,5 \u2192 6,8,8 \u2192 but output row1 is [0,6,8]. So maybe column3-5 of row3:6,8,8. But output is [0,6,8]. How does 0 come in? Unless there's an offset.\n\nWait, maybe the output's row0 is input row2, columns5,4,3 \u2192 which are 7,7,0. Reversed would be 0,7,7. Not matching.\n\nAlternatively, for output row0, take input row2, columns5,4,3 \u2192 [7,7,0]. Then reversed to [0,7,7]. But output is [0,0,7]. Not matching.\n\nThis approach isn't working. Let's think differently.\n\nLooking at example0 and example1:\n\nIn example0's output, the elements are:\n\nRow0: 0,0,7\n\nRow1:0,6,8\n\nRow2:7,8,4\n\nIn example1's output:\n\nRow0:1,0,0\n\nRow1:0,3,6\n\nRow2:0,5,2\n\nNotice that in both examples, the outputs are 3x3 matrices where the elements are arranged such that the bottom-left to top-right diagonal has increasing or specific values. For example0:7,6,4. Example1:1,3,2. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the output is a 3x3 matrix where each row is the leftmost, center, and rightmost non-zero elements from a corresponding row in the input. For example, in example0's row2 (input row2), the non-zero elements are 7,7. But output row0 is [0,0,7]. Not matching.\n\nAlternatively, the output is formed by taking the three middle elements of each of the three middle rows of the input. For example, in example0's input rows4,5,6:\n\nRow4:0,0,7,8,4,4,8,7,0,0 \u2192 middle elements 4,4,8 (columns4-6)\n\nRow5: same as row4 \u2192 4,4,8.\n\nRow6:0,0,0,6,8,8,6,0,0,0 \u2192 middle elements 8,8,6.\n\nBut output is different. So perhaps not.\n\nAnother idea: the output is a 3x3 grid capturing the top-left part of a specific transformation. For example, if the input is rotated 45 degrees, then the output is the central 3x3 of that rotated grid.\n\nRotating the input's diamond shape 45 degrees might turn it into a square, but how to map that.\n\nAlternatively, the output is the result of a convolution or some kernel applied to the input. For example, edge detection highlighting certain features. But this seems complicated.\n\nAlternatively, the output is the central 3x3 of the input after some processing, like taking only the maximum values in each 3x3 area, but that doesn't fit the examples.\n\nLet me try to see the test input and see if I can find a pattern.\n\nTest input:\n\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\n[0,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0]\n\n[0,0,0,4,4,8,4,0,0,0]\n\n[0,0,8,8,3,3,4,0,0,0]\n\n[0,0,0,4,3,3,8,8,0,0]\n\n[0,0,0,4,8,4,4,0,0,0]\n\n[0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,0]\n\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nThe output should be a 3x3 grid. Following the pattern from examples, perhaps the output takes elements from specific rows and columns.\n\nLooking at the non-zero elements in the test input. The structure seems to have a central part with 3s and 8s. For example, in row4:8,8,3,3,4.\n\nMaybe the output will be similar to the examples, taking elements from certain rows and columns.\n\nAssuming the pattern is similar to example0 and example1, where the output elements are taken from specific rows and columns in the input, let's try to find those.\n\nIn example0:\n\noutput row0:7 comes from row2, column5.\n\noutput row1:6 and8 come from row3, columns3 and4.\n\noutput row2:7,8,4 come from row4, columns2,3,4.\n\nIn example1:\n\noutput row0:1 comes from row1, column1.\n\noutput row1:3 and6 come from row2, columns2 and3.\n\noutput row2:5 and2 come from row3, column2 and3.\n\nSo the pattern seems to be:\n\nFor each example, the output is formed by taking elements from three consecutive rows in the input. For each output row i, it takes elements from input row (starting row + i), and specific columns.\n\nIn example0, starting row is2. For output row0: row2, column5. row1: row3, columns3 and4. row2: row4, columns2-4.\n\nIn example1, starting row is1. output row0: row1, column1. row1: row2, columns2 and3. row2: row3, columns2 and3.\n\nSo for each example, the output rows correspond to input rows 2,3,4 (example0) and 1,2,3 (example1). Then, the columns are varying.\n\nBut how to determine the columns.\n\nIn example0's output:\n\nRow0 has7 at column2 (input column5).\n\nRow1 has6 at column1 (input column3) and8 at column2 (input column4).\n\nRow2 has7 at column0 (input column2), 8 at column1 (input column3), and4 at column2 (input column4).\n\nSo for each output row i, the columns in the input seem to be (5-2*i), (3 + i), etc. But this is unclear.\n\nAlternatively, in example0:\n\nThe output elements are taken from the input's non-zero elements, starting from the top and moving down, picking the first, middle, and last elements of each layer.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAnother observation: in example0's output, the elements are arranged such that each subsequent row in the output moves one step inward in the input's diamond structure. For instance, the first row captures the top of the diamond, the second row captures the middle layer, and the third row captures the innermost part.\n\nApplying this to the test input, which has a similar diamond-like structure but with different numbers:\n\nThe test input's non-zero elements form a diamond-like shape. Let's identify the layers.\n\nThe outermost layer has 8s:\n\n- Row2: 8 at column5.\n\n- Row3: 4,4,8,4.\n\nWait, no. Looking at the test input:\n\nRow2: [0,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0] \u2192 only 8 at column5.\n\nRow3: [0,0,0,4,4,8,4,0,0,0] \u2192 4,4,8,4.\n\nRow4: [0,0,8,8,3,3,4,0,0,0] \u2192 8,8,3,3,4.\n\nRow5: [0,0,0,4,3,3,8,8,0,0] \u21924,3,3,8,8.\n\nRow6: [0,0,0,4,8,4,4,0,0,0] \u21924,8,4,4.\n\nRow7: [0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,0] \u21928 at column4.\n\nSo the structure is more complex. The central part has 3s and 4s and 8s.\n\nAssuming the output is formed similarly to the examples, perhaps the output will take the top elements of each layer.\n\nThe test input's layers:\n\n- Outer layer: 8s at row2, column5; row7, column4.\n\n- Next layer: 4s in row3, columns3-6 (4,4,8,4); row6, columns3-6 (4,8,4,4).\n\n- Middle layer: 8s and3s in row4 and5: row4 has 8,8,3,3,4; row5 has 4,3,3,8,8.\n\n- Innermost layer: 3s in row4, columns4-5; row5, columns4-5.\n\nSo the output might be:\n\nRow0: elements from row2, column5 (8), and surrounding zeros.\n\nRow1: elements from row3, columns3,4,5 (4,4,8). But in example0's row1, it's [0,6,8]. So perhaps taking the middle elements. Maybe row3, columns4,5,6:4,8,4 \u2192 but output row1 would be [4,8,4], which doesn't match the pattern.\n\nAlternatively, take the first non-zero elements in certain rows.\n\nAlternatively, following example0's pattern, the output rows are:\n\nRow0: input row2, column5 (8), but in example0, row0 has7 in column2. So perhaps the third column of row0 is 8. Then row1 would be input row3, column3 (4), column4 (4), column5 (8). But the output for row1 would be [0,4,8], but example0's row1 is [0,6,8]. So zeros might be in positions where the input has zeros in the selected columns.\n\nAlternatively, for the test input, let's try to apply the same pattern as example0 and example1.\n\nIn example0:\n\n- output row0: elements from input row2, columns5-7 (7,0,0) reversed to [0,0,7].\n\n- output row1: elements from input row3, columns3-5 (6,8,8) \u2192 but output is [0,6,8]. Maybe first element is row3, column2 (0), then 6,8.\n\n- output row2: elements from input row4, columns2-4 (7,8,4).\n\nSo applying this to the test input:\n\nTest input's row2: [0,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0]. columns5-7 are 8,0,0. Reversed gives [0,0,8]. So output row0: [0,0,8].\n\nRow1: input row3. columns3-5 are 4,4,8. If the output row1 is [0,4,8], but example0's row1 is [0,6,8]. So perhaps the same pattern: first element is input row3, column2 (0), then columns3-4 (4,4). So [0,4,4]. But example0's row1 has [0,6,8]. Hmm, not matching.\n\nAlternatively, row1 of output is elements from input row3, columns3-5:4,4,8. So [4,4,8]. But example0's row1 is [0,6,8]. Doesn't fit. But maybe the first element is zero because input row3, column2 is zero. So output row1: [0,4,4]. No.\n\nAlternatively, for test input's output row1, we take elements from row3, columns4-6:4,8,4. So [4,8,4]. But example0's row1 is [0,6,8]. Not matching.\n\nThis approach isn't working. Let's think back to the examples.\n\nIn example1's output, the first row is [1,0,0]. Looking at the input, the 1s are in row1, columns1 and6. The output's first row is [1,0,0]. So perhaps the first element is row1, column1 (1), and the next elements are from columns0 and2, which are zero. But not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the output is formed by taking the first non-zero element from each of three consecutive rows, starting from a certain row.\n\nIn example0:\n\n- Row2: first non-zero at column4 (7).\n\n- Row3: first non-zero at column3 (6).\n\n- Row4: first non-zero at column2 (7).\n\nBut the output rows are [0,0,7], [0,6,8], [7,8,4]. Doesn't align.\n\nAlternative hypothesis: the output is the central 3x3 of the input after removing all zeros. For example, the input's non-zero elements form a structure that, when cropped to the minimal bounding box, is 3x3. But in example0's input, the non-zero elements form a diamond that is larger than 3x3. So that's not the case.\n\nWait, in example0's output, the elements are the core of the diamond. The innermost part (4) is in the center of the output. The surrounding layers are 8, then6 and7. So perhaps the output is a 3x3 grid representing the three innermost layers of the diamond, with each row corresponding to a layer.\n\nApplying this to the test input:\n\nThe innermost layer has 3s. The middle layer has 4s and8s. The outer layer has 8s.\n\nSo the output might be:\n\nRow0: 8 from the outer layer.\n\nRow1: 4 and8 from the middle layer.\n\nRow2:3 from the inner layer.\n\nBut how to arrange this into a 3x3 grid.\n\nAlternatively, the test input's structure has:\n\n- Outer 8s at row2,5; row7,4.\n\n- Next layer:4s and8s in row3,4,5,6.\n\n- Middle layer:3s in row4,5.\n\n- Innermost 3s in row4,5.\n\nSo the output might be:\n\n[0,0,8]\n\n[0,4,8]\n\n[8,3,3]\n\nBut this is a guess. Let's see:\n\nLooking at the test input's row2:8 at column5. So output row0 could have 8 in column2.\n\nRow3 has4 at column3 and4. So output row1 could have4 in column1 and8 in column2.\n\nRow4 has8,8,3,3,4. The middle elements are3,3. So output row2 could have3,3.\n\nBut how to structure this into 3 rows.\n\nAlternatively, following the pattern from the examples, the output for the test input would be:\n\nRow0: 8 (from row2, column5) \u2192 [0,0,8]\n\nRow1:4 (from row3, column3) and8 (from row3, column5) \u2192 [0,4,8]\n\nRow2:8 (from row4, column2), 3 (from row4, column4), 3 (from row4, column5) \u2192 [8,3,3]\n\nBut this would give:\n\n[0,0,8]\n\n[0,4,8]\n\n[8,3,3]\n\nBut I'm not sure. Let's compare with the examples.\n\nIn example0's output:\n\nThe third row is [7,8,4], which comes from the input row4's elements at columns2,3,4:7,8,4.\n\nSimilarly, in the test input's row4, the elements at columns2,3,4 are8,8,3.\n\nSo maybe the output's third row is [8,8,3].\n\nBut in example0, the third row is [7,8,4], which is exactly row4, columns2-4.\n\nSo applying that pattern to the test input:\n\nOutput row0: row2, columns5-7 \u2192 [8,0,0], reversed to [0,0,8].\n\nOutput row1: row3, columns3-5 \u2192 [4,4,8]. But example0's row1 is [0,6,8]. So why in example0 it's [0,6,8] and not [6,8,8]. Maybe the columns are different.\n\nWait in example0's input row3: [0,0,0,6,8,8,6,0,0,0]. columns3-5 are6,8,8. So if we take those for row1 of the output, it's [6,8,8], but the actual output is [0,6,8]. So there's a discrepancy. Maybe the output row1 takes columns2-4 of row3:0,6,8 \u2192 which matches [0,6,8].\n\nAh! This makes sense. For example0's output row1, the elements are from row3, columns2-4:0,6,8. Similarly, row0 is from row2, columns4-6:7,7,0 \u2192 reversed to 0,7,7. But the output row0 is [0,0,7]. Hmm, not exactly. Unless it's columns5-7:7,0,0 \u2192 reversed to 0,0,7. Yes!\n\nSo the pattern seems to be:\n\nFor each output row i:\n\n- For i=0: take input row 2, columns5-7 \u2192 reversed \u2192 [7,0,0] \u2192 reversed to [0,0,7].\n\n- For i=1: take input row3, columns2-4 \u2192 [0,6,8].\n\n- For i=2: take input row4, columns2-4 \u2192 [7,8,4].\n\nThis aligns with example0's output.\n\nSimilarly, in example1:\n\nOutput row0: [1,0,0] \u2192 input row1, columns5-7:1,0,0 \u2192 reversed to [0,0,1]. But the output row0 is [1,0,0]. Hmm, not matching. Wait, perhaps the columns are different.\n\nExample1's output row0 is [1,0,0]. Input row1 is [0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0]. columns1-3:1,0,0 \u2192 which would be [1,0,0]. So for example1's row0, it's input row1, columns1-3.\n\nOutput row1: [0,3,6] \u2192 input row2, columns2-4:3,6,5 \u2192 but output is [0,3,6]. Hmm, columns2-4 in row2 of example1's input are 3,6,5. But output row1 is [0,3,6]. So perhaps columns1-3:0,3,6 \u2192 which would be [0,3,6].\n\nOutput row2: [0,5,2] \u2192 input row3, columns2-4:5,2,2 \u2192 but output is [0,5,2]. So columns1-3 of row3:0,5,2 \u2192 [0,5,2].\n\nSo the pattern seems to be:\n\nFor each output row i, the elements are taken from input row (starting_row + i), columns (5 - i*2) to (7 - i*2). For example0:\n\n- row0: i=0, row=2, columns5-7 \u2192 [7,0,0], reversed \u2192 [0,0,7].\n\n- row1: i=1, row=3, columns3-5 \u2192 [6,8,8] \u2192 but output is [0,6,8]. So not matching.\n\nAlternatively, for example0:\n\n- row0: columns5-7 of row2 \u2192 [7,0,0], reversed \u2192 [0,0,7].\n\n- row1: columns3-5 of row3 \u2192 [6,8,8], but output is [0,6,8]. So maybe columns3-5 are 6,8,8. The output is [0,6,8]. So the first element is from column2 (0), then columns3-4:6,8. So columns2-4:0,6,8.\n\nAh! So for example0's row1, the elements are taken from input row3, columns2-4:0,6,8 \u2192 which matches the output row1: [0,6,8].\n\nSimilarly, row2 of example0's output is input row4, columns2-4:7,8,4 \u2192 [7,8,4], which matches.\n\nFor example1:\n\n- row0: input row1, columns1-3:0,1,0 \u2192 output row0: [1,0,0]. So perhaps reversed? Or columns1-3: [1,0,0] \u2192 but the output is [1,0,0]. So columns1-3 are 1,0,0, which matches.\n\n- row1: input row2, columns2-4:3,6,5 \u2192 output row1: [0,3,6]. So columns2-4 are3,6,5. But output is [0,3,6], which is columns1-3:0,3,6.\n\nWait, no. Input row2 in example1 is [0,0,3,6,5,3,0,0,0,0]. Columns2-4 are3,6,5. But output row1 is [0,3,6]. So columns1-3 would be0,3,6. That matches. So perhaps for example1, the columns are shifted by one.\n\nSo the pattern seems to be:\n\nFor each example, the output rows are taken from input rows starting at a certain row (row_start), and for each output row i, the elements are taken from input row (row_start + i), columns (column_start - i) to (column_start - i + 2), where column_start varies.\n\nBut this is getting complicated. Let's try to generalize:\n\nFor each output row i:\n\n- Take input row (starting_row + i).\n\n- Take columns (center_column - i) to (center_column - i + 2).\n\nBut what is the starting_row and center_column?\n\nIn example0:\n\n- The output rows are taken from input rows2,3,4.\n\n- For row0, columns5-7 (reversed to get 0,0,7).\n\nBut example0's output row0 is [0,0,7], which could be from input row2, columns5,6,7:7,0,0 \u2192 reversed.\n\nExample1's output row0 is [1,0,0], from input row1, columns1,2,3:1,0,0.\n\nSo the pattern is:\n\nFor each example, the output is formed by taking three consecutive rows from the input, starting at a certain row, and for each of those rows, taking three consecutive columns starting at a certain column, possibly reversed.\n\nIn example0:\n\n- Output row0: input row2, columns5-7 \u2192 reversed.\n\n- Output row1: input row3, columns3-5 \u2192 not reversed.\n\n- Output row2: input row4, columns2-4 \u2192 not reversed.\n\nBut this doesn't form a clear pattern.\n\nAlternatively, the columns are adjusted based on the row. For example, for each output row i, the starting column is 5 - i*2.\n\nFor example0:\n\n- row0:5-0*2=5 \u2192 columns5-7 \u2192 [7,0,0] \u2192 reversed \u2192 [0,0,7].\n\n- row1:5-1*2=3 \u2192 columns3-5 \u2192 [6,8,8] \u2192 but output is [0,6,8]. So maybe columns3-5 of row3 is [6,8,8], but the output is [0,6,8]. So perhaps columns2-4 instead.\n\nAlternatively, for row i, the starting column is 5 - i*1. So:\n\nrow0:5 \u2192 columns5-7.\n\nrow1:5-1=4 \u2192 columns4-6.\n\nrow2:5-2=3 \u2192 columns3-5.\n\nBut in example0:\n\n- row0:5-0=5 \u2192 columns5-7 \u21927,0,0 \u2192 reversed to 0,0,7.\n\n- row1:5-1=4 \u2192 columns4-6 of row3 \u21928,8,6 \u2192 output row1 is [0,6,8]. Not matching.\n\nThis approach isn't working.\n\nLet me try to apply this pattern to the test input.\n\nTest input:\n\nRows to consider would be rows2,3,4,5,6,7. The output is 3x3.\n\nAssuming the output rows are taken from rows2,3,4.\n\nFor test input's output:\n\nRow0: input row2, columns5-7 \u21928,0,0 \u2192 reversed \u21920,0,8.\n\nRow1: input row3, columns3-5 \u21924,4,8 \u2192 maybe take as [0,4,4] if columns2-4 are0,4,4.\n\nWait, input row3: [0,0,0,4,4,8,4,0,0,0]. columns3-5 are4,4,8. If the output row1 is [0,4,8], perhaps taking columns3-5, but the output is [0,4,8]. So first element is from column3-5's first element4. But example0's row1 is [0,6,8], which comes from columns3-5's first element6. So perhaps the output row1 is [4,4,8], but example0's is [0,6,8]. Not matching.\n\nAlternatively, row1's columns are3-5 for example0, giving6,8,8. But output row1 is [0,6,8]. So first element is 0, which is column2 of row3. So columns2-4 of row3:0,6,8 \u2192 output row1 [0,6,8].\n\nApplying this to the test input's row3, columns2-4:0,0,4. So output row1 would be [0,0,4], which doesn't fit the example1 pattern.\n\nThis is getting too complicated. Perhaps the key is that the output is the central 3x3 part of the input after some rotation or flipping. \n\nAlternatively, each output row corresponds to a different ring in the input's structure, with the first row being the outermost ring, second the middle, third the innermost.\n\nIn example0's output:\n\nRow0:7 (outer ring)\n\nRow1:6,8 (middle ring)\n\nRow2:4 (inner ring)\n\nBut how to arrange this into a 3x3.\n\nAlternatively, the output is the top-left part of each layer. For example:\n\nOuter layer:7s at positions (2,4), (2,5), (3,3), (3,6), etc. The top-left part of this layer would be the 7 at (2,4), which is not in the output. But example0's output has7 at (0,2). Not sure.\n\nAnother idea: the output is the first three non-zero elements encountered when scanning the input from top to bottom, left to right, taking three elements per row.\n\nBut example0's input has many non-zero elements. The first three non-zero would be7,7,6, etc. Doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, the output is formed by taking the first non-zero element from each of three consecutive rows, then the second non-zero, then the third. But this doesn't match examples.\n\nAfter spending a lot of time and not finding a clear pattern, I'll try to apply the pattern from the examples to the test input based on the assumption that each output row is taken from input rows 2,3,4, and columns varying.\n\nFor example, in example0, output row0 is input row2, columns5-7 reversed \u2192 [0,0,7].\n\nTest input row2: columns5-7 are8,0,0 \u2192 reversed \u21920,0,8 \u2192 output row0: [0,0,8].\n\nExample0 row1: input row3, columns2-4 \u21920,6,8 \u2192 output row1: [0,6,8].\n\nTest input row3, columns2-4:0,0,4 \u2192 output row1: [0,0,4]. But this may not fit.\n\nExample0 row2: input row4, columns2-4:7,8,4 \u2192 output row2: [7,8,4].\n\nTest input row4, columns2-4:8,8,3 \u2192 output row2: [8,8,3].\n\nBut the example1's output row0 is [1,0,0], which comes from input row1, columns1-3:1,0,0.\n\nSo perhaps the general pattern is:\n\nFor each example, the output rows are taken from three consecutive input rows (starting from a certain row), and for each of those rows, the three consecutive columns starting from a certain column (possibly varying per row).\n\nFor example0: rows2,3,4. columns5,3,2.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the output is formed by taking the central elements of each layer in the input. For example, the top of the outer layer, the middle of the middle layer, and the bottom of the inner layer.\n\nBut without a clear pattern, I'll have to make an educated guess based on the test input's structure.\n\nLooking at the test input's rows2-7:\n\nRow2:8 at column5.\n\nRow3:4,4,8,4 at columns3-6.\n\nRow4:8,8,3,3,4 at columns2-6.\n\nRow5:4,3,3,8,8 at columns3-7.\n\nRow6:4,8,4,4 at columns3-6.\n\nRow7:8 at column4.\n\nThe central part is around rows4-5, columns4-5 with 3s.\n\nFollowing the example0's pattern, the output's third row would be the central elements from row4 and5. For example, row4, columns4-5 are3,3. Row5, columns4-5 are3,3. So maybe the output's third row is [3,3, something].\n\nBut the output is supposed to be 3x3. Let's try to pick the elements:\n\nAssuming the output's rows are formed from input rows2,3,4:\n\nRow0: from row2, column5 \u21928. So [0,0,8].\n\nRow1: from row3, columns3-5 \u21924,4,8 \u2192 but example0's row1 is [0,6,8]. So perhaps the first element is from column2 (0), then columns3-4 \u21924,4. So row1 would be [0,4,4].\n\nRow2: from row4, columns2-4 \u21928,8,3 \u2192 [8,8,3].\n\nSo the output would be:\n\n[0,0,8]\n\n[0,4,4]\n\n[8,8,3]\n\nBut this doesn't match the examples' structure.\n\nAlternatively, for row1, columns4-6 of row3:8,4,0 \u2192 reversed \u21920,4,8. So row1 is [0,4,8].\n\nRow2: row4, columns2-4 \u21928,8,3 \u2192 [8,8,3].\n\nThen output would be:\n\n[0,0,8]\n\n[0,4,8]\n\n[8,8,3]\n\nBut I'm not sure if this is correct.\n\nAnother possibility is that the output is formed by taking the first, middle, and last elements of certain rows. For example:\n\nIn example0's row2, the first non-zero is7 at column4. The middle non-zero is7 at column5. The last non-zero is0.\n\nBut not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the output for the test input is:\n\n[0,0,8]\n\n[0,4,8]\n\n[8,3,3]\n\nBecause:\n\n- Row0:8 from row2, column5.\n\n- Row1:4 and8 from row3, column3 and5.\n\n- Row2:8 from row4, column2, and3,3 from row4, columns4-5.\n\nBut this is just a guess.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and the need to provide an answer, I'll go with the pattern where each output row is taken from input rows 2,3,4, and columns are selected such that for row i, columns are (5-2i) to (7-2i), and then reversed if i=0.\n\nSo for test input:\n\nRow0: input row2, columns5-7:8,0,0 \u2192 reversed \u21920,0,8 \u2192 [0,0,8].\n\nRow1: input row3, columns3-5:4,4,8 \u2192 but example0's row1 is [0,6,8], so perhaps columns2-4:0,4,4 \u2192 [0,4,4].\n\nRow2: input row4, columns2-4:8,8,3 \u2192 [8,8,3].\n\nBut example0's row2 is [7,8,4], which matches columns2-4 of row4.\n\nSo putting it together:\n\n[0,0,8]\n\n[0,4,4]\n\n[8,8,3]\n\nBut I'm not sure. However, looking at the test input's row5, which is [0,0,0,4,3,3,8,8,0,0]. The elements 4,3,3,8,8 are in columns3-7. Maybe the output's row2 should include these.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is:\n\n[0, 0, 8]\n\n[0,4,8]\n\n[8,3,3]\n\nBecause row3's column5 is8, row4's column4 is3.\n\nBut this is a best guess. Given the time constraints, I'll proceed with this answer.",

        "cot_2": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. So, the problem is to take a 10x10 grid of numbers and transform it into a 3x3 grid. The training examples should give me clues about how this transformation works.\n\nLooking at Example 0's input. The input is a 10x10 grid with mostly zeros, and some numbers arranged in a sort of symmetrical pattern. The output is a 3x3 grid. Let me see the positions of the numbers in the input and how they map to the output.\n\nIn Example 0's input, the first non-zero rows are row 2 (third row, since counting starts at 0 maybe?) which has 7,7 in the middle. Then row 3 has 6,8,8,6. Rows 4 and 5 have 7,8,4,4,8,7. Then it mirrors downwards. The output is a 3x3 grid. Let's see the output values: [0,0,7], [0,6,8], [7,8,4]. Hmm. Maybe the output is taking the center 3x3 of some structure. But the input's non-zero area is larger than 3x3. Alternatively, perhaps it's taking the central part after some processing.\n\nWait, maybe the pattern is that the output is the central 3x3 of the original grid. But in the first example, the original input's center isn't exactly the same as the output. Let's check. The input is 10x10, so the exact center would be around positions (4.5,4.5). So maybe the center 3x3 would be rows 4,5,6 and columns 4,5,6. Let's check Example 0's input rows 4,5,6 and columns 4-6.\n\nRow 4 in input example 0 is [0, 0, 7, 8, 4, 4, 8, 7, 0, 0]. Columns 4-6 would be 4,4,8? Wait no. Wait, columns are from 0 to 9. So row 4, columns 4,5,6 would be 4,4,8? Then row 5 columns 4-6 would be 4,4,8 again? But the output in example 0 is [7,8,4] as the third row. That doesn't line up. Maybe not the exact center.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is the minimal 3x3 grid that captures the core non-zero elements. Let's look at the input of example 0. The non-zero elements form a diamond shape. The output seems to be the center part. For example, in input example 0, the middle rows (rows 3,4,5) have the higher numbers. Let's check row indices. Wait, example 0's input:\n\nRow 2: [0,0,0,0,7,7,0,0,0,0]\nRow 3: [0,0,0,6,8,8,6,0,0,0]\nRow 4: [0,0,7,8,4,4,8,7,0,0]\nRow 5: same as row 4\nRow 6: same as row 3\nRow 7: same as row 2.\n\nSo the non-zero elements form a symmetrical pattern. The output is a 3x3. Let's see the output of example 0: first row is 0,0,7. Second row 0,6,8. Third row 7,8,4. So maybe the output is taking the first occurrence of non-zero elements as we move from the edges towards the center. Wait, but that might not explain the exact numbers.\n\nAnother approach: perhaps the output is the top-left 3x3 of the original grid. No, because in example 0, the original starts with all zeros. Wait, maybe the output is taken from a specific position. Let's see in example 0's output:\n\nFirst output row is [0,0,7]. Looking at input rows, perhaps in the input's row 2 (third row) there's 7 in positions 4 and 5. The output's first row is third element 7, the others 0. Maybe it's taking the middle part.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's a kernel or convolution. But perhaps the pattern is that the output is the 3x3 grid starting at a certain position. Let me check the positions of the numbers in example 0's output:\n\nOutput rows are [0,0,7], [0,6,8], [7,8,4]. Let's see where these numbers come from in the input. For example, the 7 in the first output row's third position. Looking at input's row 2, column 4 is 7. Then in output row 0, column 2: 7. Then row 1 of output has 6 and 8. In the input's row 3, columns 3 and 4: 6 and 8. So output row 1 is [0,6,8], which would correspond to input row 3, columns 3,4,5 (6,8,8). But the output has 6 and 8. So maybe it's taking row 3, columns 3,4,5: 6,8,8. But the output's row1 is [0,6,8]. Wait, why is the first element 0?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is formed by taking the central 3x3 of the original grid. Wait, the input is 10x10. So the center would be between rows 4 and 5, but since it's even, there's no exact center. So maybe taking rows 4-6 and columns 4-6? Let's check example 0's input:\n\nRow 4: [0,0,7,8,4,4,8,7,0,0]\nRow 5: same as row4\nRow6: [0,0,0,6,8,8,6,0,0,0]\n\nSo columns 4-6 for rows4-6 would be:\n\nRow4: columns4-6: 4,4,8\nRow5: same as row4: 4,4,8\nRow6: columns4-6:8,8,6\n\nBut the output of example0 is:\n\n[0,0,7]\n[0,6,8]\n[7,8,4]\n\nThat doesn't align. So perhaps that's not the approach.\n\nLooking at example1's input and output. Input is a different 10x10 grid. The output is [1,0,0], [0,3,6], [0,5,2]. Let's see where these numbers come from.\n\nIn example1's input, the first non-zero rows are row1: [0,1,0,...], then row2 has [0,0,3,6,5,3,0,...], row3 has [0,0,5,2,2,6,...], row4 [0,0,6,2,2,5,...], etc. The output is a 3x3. Let's see if the output's numbers are taken from specific positions.\n\nThe first output row is [1,0,0]. In the input's row1, the 1 is at position 1. Then the output's first element is 1. The second element is 0, third is 0. The second output row is [0,3,6]. In the input's row2, the third element is 3, fourth is 6. So maybe the second row of output is taking elements from row2, positions 2,3,4? But input row2 has 3,6,5 in positions 2,3,4. Output is 3 and6 here. So perhaps the output's second row is the middle three elements of row2. But row2 is [0,0,3,6,5,3,0,0,0,0]. Middle three would be 6,5,3? No. Or maybe the first non-zero elements. Alternatively, looking at the output's third row: [0,5,2]. In the input's row3, the third element is 5, fourth is2. So maybe output row3 takes elements from row3's positions3,4,5? But row3's elements are 5,2,2. So the output's third row is [5,2,2], but the actual output is [0,5,2]. Hmm, that doesn't align.\n\nWait, example1's output is:\n\nRow0: [1,0,0]\n\nRow1: [0,3,6]\n\nRow2: [0,5,2]\n\nLooking at the input grid:\n\nRow1 (second row in input, since first is index0) has [0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0]. The output's first row starts with 1. So maybe the 1 is from row1, column1. Then the output row0, column0 is 1. But the output row0 is [1,0,0]. So 1 is at (0,0), then 0s.\n\nThen row1 of output is [0,3,6]. Looking at input's row2 (third row), which is [0,0,3,6,5,3,0,0,0,0]. The third element is 3, fourth is6. So maybe the output row1 is [3,6,5], but the output is [0,3,6]. So perhaps the first element is zero, then 3,6. Hmm, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is taking the first occurrence of the highest numbers in each layer around the center. Alternatively, maybe the output is the 3x3 grid centered on the center of the original input's non-zero pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking the three middle rows and three middle columns. Let's see: for a 10x10 grid, the middle rows would be rows 4,5,6 (since 10 rows, zero-based, indices 0-9. 10/2=5, so rows 4,5,6 perhaps). Similarly for columns.\n\nIn example0's input:\n\nRow4: [0,0,7,8,4,4,8,7,0,0]\n\nRow5: same as row4.\n\nRow6: [0,0,0,6,8,8,6,0,0,0]\n\nColumns 4,5,6 would be:\n\nFor row4: columns4-6:4,4,8.\n\nRow5: same as row4: 4,4,8.\n\nRow6: columns4-6:8,8,6.\n\nBut the output for example0 is:\n\n[0,0,7]\n\n[0,6,8]\n\n[7,8,4]\n\nWhich doesn't match these values. So that can't be.\n\nWait, maybe the output is a zoomed-in view of the center, but how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the pattern is that each layer of the original grid (like rings around the center) is being compressed into a 3x3 grid. For example, the outer layers are ignored, and the innermost layers are kept.\n\nWait, the original input in example0 has a structure that is symmetric. The output's 3x3 grid might be the central part of this structure. Let me check the positions of the numbers in the output.\n\nIn example0's output:\n\nRow0: [0,0,7]\n\nRow1: [0,6,8]\n\nRow2: [7,8,4]\n\nLooking at the input grid, perhaps these correspond to:\n\nRow0 of output: perhaps row2 (third row) of input, columns4 and5 (7,7). But output row0 is [0,0,7], so third element 7. But input row2, column4 and5 are 7. So maybe the 7s are in the middle of that row, and the output is taking the rightmost 7? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is taking the first three non-zero elements from certain positions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is a 3x3 grid formed by the first non-zero element in each row and column. But I need to find a consistent pattern across both examples.\n\nLooking at example1's input. The output is:\n\n[1,0,0]\n\n[0,3,6]\n\n[0,5,2]\n\nIn the input, the first row of the output (1,0,0) seems to come from row1 (second row) of the input, where there's a 1 at column1. Then, the output's next rows could be from row2 and row3. For example, row2 of input is [0,0,3,6,5,3,0,0,0,0]. The third and fourth elements are 3 and 6. In the output's second row, we have 3 and6. But the output's second row starts with 0. So maybe the output is taking elements from columns 2,3,4 of row2, which are 3,6,5. But the output's second row is [0,3,6]. Hmm, that doesn't fit. Unless there's a shift.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is formed by rotating or flipping the original structure. For example, in example0, the original seems to have a diamond shape. The output could be the top-left portion after a certain transformation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the 3x3 grid from the center of the original after collapsing each 3x3 block into a single value. But that doesn't seem to fit.\n\nWait, let's look at the two outputs:\n\nExample0's output:\n\nRow0: 0,0,7\n\nRow1: 0,6,8\n\nRow2:7,8,4\n\nExample1's output:\n\nRow0:1,0,0\n\nRow1:0,3,6\n\nRow2:0,5,2\n\nLooking at these, maybe the output is taking certain elements from the input's non-zero regions. For example, in example0's output, the 7 in the top right could come from row2, column5 (7). The 6 and 8 in row1 could come from row3, columns3 and4 (6,8). The 7,8,4 in row2 could come from row4, columns2,3,4 (7,8,4). So it's like taking elements from specific rows and columns.\n\nFor example0's output:\n\n- Output row0: elements from input row2, columns4 and5 (7,7), but in output it's [0,0,7]. So perhaps the third element is the first 7 from the right in row2.\n\n- Output row1: input row3, columns3,4,5 (6,8,8) \u2192 [6,8,8], but output is [0,6,8]. So first element is 0, then 6,8. Maybe the middle three columns of row3, but starting from column3? 6 is column3, 8 column4, 8 column5. So output row1 is [6,8,8], but actual output is [0,6,8]. Hmm, not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each row of the output corresponds to a different row in the input. For example, output row0 corresponds to input row2, output row1 to input row3, output row2 to input row4. Then, taking specific columns.\n\nIn example0's output:\n\nRow0 of output: 0,0,7. If input row2 is [0,0,0,0,7,7,0,0,0,0], then columns4,5,6 would be 7,7,0. But output is [0,0,7], which could be columns3,4,5? Which are 0,7,7. So maybe columns 3,4,5 of input row2. But output row0 is [0,0,7]. So if it's columns4,5,6:7,7,0. Output is [0,0,7], which would require that the third element is 7. Hmm, but input row2's column4 and5 are 7s. So maybe the first 7 in the row, but that's not matching.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is capturing the central 3x3 of the non-zero area. Let's imagine that in example0's input, the non-zero numbers form a diamond shape. The highest numbers are in the center. The output could be the center 3x3 of this structure. Let's see:\n\nLooking at example0's input, the highest numbers are 4 in the very center (rows4 and5, columns4-5). Then surrounding them are 8s, then 7s and 6s. The output's third row is [7,8,4]. That matches row4 of the input, columns2,3,4:7,8,4. So row4, columns2,3,4:7,8,4. Then row3, columns3,4,5:6,8,8. Which would be [6,8,8], but the output's row1 is [0,6,8]. Hmm. Or maybe it's rows3,4,5 and columns3,4,5. Let's check:\n\nRow3: columns3-5:6,8,8\n\nRow4: columns3-5:8,4,4\n\nRow5: same as row4:8,4,4\n\nBut the output is:\n\n[0,0,7]\n\n[0,6,8]\n\n[7,8,4]\n\nSo that doesn't match.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is taking elements from the input's grid where the values are in a cross shape. For example, the center plus the four directions. But again, not sure.\n\nAnother approach: the output grids in the examples have a pattern similar to the input's top-left quadrant or a rotated version. For instance, example0's output looks like a rotated version of the central part of the input. Let's see:\n\nIn example0's input, the central part around rows4-6 and columns4-6:\n\nRow4: 4,4,8\n\nRow5:4,4,8\n\nRow6:8,8,6\n\nBut the output is:\n\n0 0 7\n\n0 6 8\n\n7 8 4\n\nWhich doesn't match. Wait, perhaps the output is a transposed or rotated version. For example, taking elements from the input's upper left quadrant and rotating them. Let me check.\n\nIn example0's input, the top-left quadrant would be rows0-4 and columns0-4. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the output could be the three layers surrounding the center. For example, in example0's input, the numbers form concentric layers. The output captures the middle layer. But this is vague.\n\nWait, let's look at the test input and see if applying a similar pattern can help.\n\nTest input:\n\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\n[0,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0]\n\n[0,0,0,4,4,8,4,0,0,0]\n\n[0,0,8,8,3,3,4,0,0,0]\n\n[0,0,0,4,3,3,8,8,0,0]\n\n[0,0,0,4,8,4,4,0,0,0]\n\n[0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nThe rest are zeros.\n\nThe output should be a 3x3 grid. Let's imagine what the output would be if the pattern is similar to the training examples. For example, in the training examples, the output is a 3x3 grid taken from the central part of the input's non-zero structure. Let's look for the non-zero areas.\n\nIn test input, the non-zero elements start at row2 (third row) with an 8 in column5. Then row3 has 4,4,8,4 in columns3-6. Row4 has 8,8,3,3,4 in columns2-6. Row5 has 4,3,3,8,8 in columns3-7. Row6 has4,8,4,4 in columns3-6. Row7 has 8 in column4.\n\nSo the non-zero structure is somewhat symmetrical. The highest numbers are 8s and 3s. The center might be around rows4-5, columns4-5. Let's see:\n\nLooking for the central 3x3. The center of the 10x10 grid would be around rows 4.5 and columns4.5. So the central 3x3 would be rows4,5,6 and columns4,5,6. Let's check those positions.\n\nRow4: columns4-6:3,3,4.\n\nRow5: columns4-6:3,3,8.\n\nRow6: columns4-6:8,4,4.\n\nSo the 3x3 would be:\n\nRow4:3,3,4\n\nRow5:3,3,8\n\nRow6:8,4,4\n\nBut the output from training examples don't directly take the center. For instance, example0's output is different. So maybe that's not the pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is taking elements from specific positions relative to the non-zero structure. For example, the first row of the output takes elements from the first non-zero row in the input, and the columns where the non-zero elements start. Let's try that for example0.\n\nIn example0's input, the first non-zero row is row2 (third row), which has 7s in columns4 and5. The output's first row is [0,0,7]. So maybe it's taking row2's 7 at column5. Then for the second row of output, looking at row3 of input, which has 6 in column3 and 8 in columns4 and5. The output's second row is [0,6,8], which might correspond to row3's columns3,4,5 (6,8,8). The third row of output is [7,8,4], which might be row4's columns2,3,4 (7,8,4).\n\nIf this is the pattern, then for each of the first three non-zero rows in the input, the output takes three elements starting from the first non-zero element's position. Let's check example1.\n\nExample1's input has non-zero elements in row1 (columns1 and6). The output's first row is [1,0,0], which is the row1's elements1,2,3 (1,0,0). Then row2 of input has non-zero elements starting at column2 (3,6,5,3). The output's second row is [0,3,6], which could be row2's columns2,3,4 (3,6,5) \u2192 but output is [0,3,6]. So perhaps it's taking columns1,2,3 (0,3,6) \u2192 which would match. Then row3 of input has elements3,4,5 as 2,2,6. The output's third row is [0,5,2], which might be row3's columns2,3,4 (5,2,2). But output is [0,5,2]. Hmm, this doesn't align. So maybe the columns are shifted.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is taking the central three elements of the first three non-zero rows. For example0:\n\nFirst non-zero row (row2): [0,0,0,0,7,7,0,0,0,0]. The central elements here would be positions3,4,5:0,7,7. Output row0 is [0,0,7]. So perhaps taking the last three elements of this row's non-zero part. The non-zero part is 7,7. So maybe the output's first row is the three elements starting from the first non-zero element. In row2 of example0, the first non-zero is at column4. So columns4,5,6:7,7,0. Output row0 is [0,0,7]. Not matching.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each row of the output is formed by the first three non-zero elements of the corresponding input row. Let's check:\n\nExample0's output row0 is [0,0,7]. The input's row2 (third row) has 7s at positions4 and5. But the first three non-zero elements would be 7,7, but output has 7 as third element. Maybe padding with zeros. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the 3x3 grid that captures the minimal bounding box around the non-zero elements. Let's see for example0. The non-zero elements form a diamond shape. The minimal bounding box would be from row2 to row7, columns2 to7. But that's a 6x6 area, which is larger than 3x3. So maybe the center of this area. But it's unclear.\n\nLet me try to look for another pattern. The output in example0 has a 4 in the center, which is the smallest number in that output. The surrounding numbers are higher (6,7,8). Similarly, example1's output has a 3 in the center, surrounded by lower numbers. Maybe the output is capturing a sort of kernel where the center is the smallest value, but that's just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is a 3x3 grid that's the transpose of some part of the input. For example, in example0's output, the third row is [7,8,4]. In the input's row4, columns2-4 are7,8,4. So if the output's third row is taken from here, then perhaps the output is formed by taking the first three non-zero elements of certain rows, and transposing them.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the test input, perhaps the output is constructed as follows:\n\nIn test input, the first non-zero row is row2 (third row) with an 8 in column5. The next non-zero rows are rows3,4,5,6,7.\n\nRow2: [0,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow3: [0,0,0,4,4,8,4,0,0,0]\n\nRow4: [0,0,8,8,3,3,4,0,0,0]\n\nRow5: [0,0,0,4,3,3,8,8,0,0]\n\nRow6: [0,0,0,4,8,4,4,0,0,0]\n\nRow7: [0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nSo the non-zero elements form a sort of pattern. Let's see where the output could be taken. If following the pattern of example0 and example1, perhaps the output takes the first three non-zero rows and their first three non-zero elements. But example1's output has three rows, but not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is formed by taking the first three rows where non-zero elements start and taking three elements from each. For example, in test input:\n\nRow2: first non-zero element at column5 (8). So output's first row might be [0,0,8].\n\nRow3: first non-zero at column3 (4). So elements3-5:4,4,8. Output row2 would be [4,4,8].\n\nRow4: first non-zero at column2 (8). Elements2-4:8,8,3. Output row3: [8,8,3].\n\nBut the output from the examples are 3x3. So perhaps this isn't the case.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the test input's structure, it seems like the center is around row4 and column4-5. So perhaps the output is taking the elements around this center. For example, rows4-6 and columns4-6.\n\nRow4: columns4-6 \u21923,3,4\n\nRow5: columns4-6 \u21923,3,8\n\nRow6: columns4-6 \u21928,4,4\n\nSo that would give a 3x3 grid:\n\n[3,3,4]\n\n[3,3,8]\n\n[8,4,4]\n\nBut in example0, the output's center is 4, which is the smallest number. In this test case, the center would be 3. But the example outputs have varying centers. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is the top-left 3x3 of the original input after some transformation. But in example0, the input's top-left is all zeros. So that's not possible.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is a 3x3 grid formed by taking the maximum values from certain regions. For example, each output cell is the maximum of a 3x3 block in the input. But example0's output has 4 as the center, which is the minimum. So that's not likely.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the 3x3 grid that starts at the first non-zero row and first non-zero column. For example, in test input, the first non-zero row is row2, first non-zero column is5. So starting at row2, column5. But a 3x3 grid would include columns5-7 and rows2-4. Let's see:\n\nRow2:5-7 \u21928,0,0\n\nRow3:5-7 \u21928,4,0\n\nRow4:5-7 \u21923,4,0\n\nSo the output would be:\n\n[8,0,0]\n\n[8,4,0]\n\n[3,4,0]\n\nBut this doesn't match the training examples' outputs.\n\nAnother approach: looking at the training examples, the outputs seem to have a 7,6,8,4 in example0 and 1,3,5,6,2 in example1. These numbers are present in the input but arranged in a way that's not directly the same as the input's layout. So maybe the output is a transformed version, like rotated or mirrored.\n\nIn example0's output, the third row is [7,8,4]. In the input's row4, columns2-4 are 7,8,4. So if we take this and put it in the output's third row, perhaps the output's rows are taken from certain parts of the input's rows.\n\nIn example0, output rows correspond to input rows2,3,4. Let's see:\n\nRow2 input: [0,0,0,0,7,7,0,0,0,0] \u2192 output row0: [0,0,7]\n\nRow3 input: [0,0,0,6,8,8,6,0,0,0] \u2192 output row1: [0,6,8]\n\nRow4 input: [0,0,7,8,4,4,8,7,0,0] \u2192 output row2: [7,8,4]\n\nSo output row0 is the first three non-zero elements of input row2: 7,7 \u2192 but output row0 is [0,0,7]. Maybe the last three elements of the non-zero part. Input row2's non-zero part is 7,7. So perhaps the output takes the last non-zero elements. But that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, for each of the first three non-zero rows in the input, take the three elements starting from the first non-zero element's position. For example0:\n\nInput row2: first non-zero at column4. Take columns4,5,6:7,7,0 \u2192 output row0: [7,7,0], but the actual output is [0,0,7]. Doesn't match.\n\nAlternatively, the output's rows are the first three non-zero rows of the input, and the columns are the first three non-zero columns. For example0, first non-zero row is row2, columns4 and5. So output row0: columns4,5,6 (7,7,0) \u2192 [7,7,0]. But output row0 is [0,0,7]. No match.\n\nAnother idea: the output is formed by taking the central 3x3 of the input after rotating it 45 degrees. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is the central 3x3 of the input after scaling down. For example, every other row and column. But again, not sure.\n\nLet me try to look for another pattern. In example0's output, the numbers seem to form a pattern where each row and column increases towards the center. The center is 4, surrounded by 8, which is surrounded by 6 and7. Similarly, example1's output has 3 in the middle, surrounded by higher numbers. Maybe the output is capturing the central three layers of a diamond-shaped pattern.\n\nIn test input's case, the central 3x3 could be around the 3s in row4 and5. So let's see:\n\nThe test input's rows4 and5 have 3s. So the output might be:\n\n[0,0,8] from row2, column5\n\n[0,4,8] from row3, columns3-5:4,4,8\n\n[8,8,3] from row4, columns2-4:8,8,3\n\nBut example0's output has three rows, each from different input rows. If test input's output follows the same pattern as example0, then:\n\nOutput row0 would be from row2 (third row), which has an 8 at column5. So maybe [0,0,8]?\n\nRow1 from row3 (fourth row), which has 4,4,8. So maybe [0,4,8]?\n\nRow2 from row4 (fifth row), which has8,8,3. So [8,8,3]?\n\nBut the training examples' outputs have different structures. For example, example1's output starts with a row from the second input row (row1) with 1. So perhaps each example's output starts from the first non-zero row.\n\nAlternatively, the output is formed by taking three rows from the input, each shifted to the left. For example, in example0, the first non-zero row is row2 (third row). Taking row2's elements shifted left until the first element is non-zero. So row2 is [0,0,0,0,7,7,0,0,0,0]. Shifted left by 4 positions, we get [7,7,0,0,0,0]. But the output row is [0,0,7]. Not sure.\n\nThis is getting a bit stuck. Maybe I should look for another approach. Let's consider that in both training examples, the output is a 3x3 matrix that is a subset of the input, possibly after some rotation or reflection.\n\nLooking at example0's output:\n\n0 0 7\n\n0 6 8\n\n7 8 4\n\nThis looks like the upper-left portion of a larger structure, but rotated. For instance, if we imagine the input's central area, this output is the top-left part of that. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the 3x3 grid that starts at the position of the first non-zero element in the input. For example0's first non-zero is row2, column4 (7). So the output would start there and take the next 3 rows and 3 columns:\n\nRow2, columns4-6:7,7,0\n\nRow3, columns4-6:8,8,6\n\nRow4, columns4-6:4,4,8\n\nBut the output is different. So no.\n\nAlternatively, the output is the 3x3 grid that is the upper-left corner of the original input's non-zero region after it has been rotated 45 degrees. But this is speculative.\n\nWait, another possible pattern: in example0, the output is formed by taking the three middle elements of each of the three middle non-zero rows. For example:\n\nRow2 of input (third row) has 7,7 in the middle. Middle three elements would be positions4,5,6:7,7,0 \u2192 output row0 is [0,0,7]. Not matching.\n\nAlternatively, taking the three elements from the center of each non-zero row. For example0's row4 has 7,8,4,4,8,7. The center would be elements4,5,6:4,4,8. But the output row2 is [7,8,4]. Not matching.\n\nHmm. Maybe I should think of the output as a kind of \"core\" of the input's structure. For example0, the input's core is the 4, surrounded by 8s, then 7s and 6s. The output captures that core. So the output is the 3x3 around the smallest number (4 in example0, 2 in example1). Let's check:\n\nIn example0's input, the smallest number is 4, located at the center. The output's center is 4. Surrounding it are 8s and 6s and7s.\n\nIn example1's input, the smallest number in the non-zero region is 2 (in rows3 and4). The output's center is3, but example1's output has 2 in the third row. So maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is formed by taking the first three layers of the input's structure. But I'm not sure.\n\nAnother approach: think of the input as a 2D array where the output is the 3x3 grid that includes the first occurrence of the highest number. Let's see:\n\nIn example0, the highest number is8. The first occurrence is in row3, column4. Taking a 3x3 around that: rows3-5, columns3-5. Row3:6,8,8. Row4:8,4,4. Row5:8,4,4. So the 3x3 would be:\n\n6 8 8\n\n8 4 4\n\n8 4 4\n\nBut the output is different. So that's not it.\n\nAlternatively, the output is a 3x3 grid where each element is the sum of surrounding elements. But example0's output doesn't seem to be sums.\n\nThis is really tricky. Let me try to look for another angle. Maybe the output is the upper-left 3x3 of the input after some transformation. For example, rotating or flipping.\n\nIn example0's output, the third row is7,8,4. In the input's row4, the third element is7, fourth is8, fifth is4. So if we take the first three elements of row4, shifted to the right, maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, the output is the upper-left 3x3 of the input's mirror image. For example, reflecting the input over a vertical axis. Let's see:\n\nExample0's input reflected vertically would have the same structure since it's symmetric. So the output would be the same.\n\nAlternatively, the output is the upper-left 3x3 of the input's central part. For example, taking rows5-7 and columns5-7. But example0's output doesn't align.\n\nMaybe the pattern is that the output is the first 3x3 grid that contains the highest number in the input. For example0, highest is8. The first 3x3 grid that includes an8 would be rows3-5, columns3-5. Which includes 6,8,8 in row3, 8,4,4 in row4, 8,4,4 in row5. But the output is different.\n\nAnother idea: the output is formed by taking the first three non-zero elements from three consecutive rows, starting from the first row that has a non-zero element. For example:\n\nExample0's first non-zero row is row2. Take the first three non-zero elements from row2:7,7. But since it's less than three, pad with zeros. So [7,7,0], but the output row0 is [0,0,7]. Doesn't fit.\n\nExample1's first non-zero row is row1. First three non-zero elements are1 and1. But output row0 is [1,0,0]. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, for each of the first three non-zero rows, take the first non-zero element and the next two elements. For example0's row2: first non-zero is at column4 \u21927, then next two elements:7,0 \u2192 row0:7,7,0. Output row0 is [0,0,7]. Doesn't match.\n\nThis is getting frustrating. Let me look at the test input again and see if I can guess the output based on the training examples' patterns.\n\nTest input's non-zero elements are arranged in a sort of hourglass shape. The highest numbers are 8s. The center seems to be around row4-5, column4-5, which have 3s. Let's imagine the output is similar to example0 and example1, which took elements from the middle rows and columns. For example:\n\nThe test input's row2 has 8 in column5. Row3 has 4,4,8,4. Row4 has8,8,3,3,4. Row5 has4,3,3,8,8. Row6 has4,8,4,4. \n\nIf following example0's pattern where the output rows are from the first three non-zero rows, then:\n\nRow2 (test input's first non-zero row) has 8 at column5. Output row0 might be [0,0,8].\n\nRow3 has elements3-5:4,4,8. Output row1: [0,4,4,8]. But output rows are 3 elements, so [0,4,4] but maybe shifted.\n\nAlternatively, taking the central three elements of row3: columns4-6 are4,8,4. Output row1: [4,8,4].\n\nRow4's central elements are3,3. Columns4-5. So taking columns3-5:8,3,3. Output row2: [8,3,3].\n\nBut the output would be:\n\n[0,0,8]\n\n[4,8,4]\n\n[8,3,3]\n\nBut this doesn't align with the training examples' structure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is:\n\n[0,0,8]\n\n[0,4,8]\n\n[8,8,3]\n\nWhich is taking from row2 column5 (8), row3 columns3-5 (4,4,8), row4 columns2-4 (8,8,3). This forms:\n\nRow0:0,0,8\n\nRow1:0,4,8 (assuming middle of row3's non-zero elements)\n\nRow2:8,8,3\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is the central part of the input's structure. For test input, the central area is around rows4-5, columns4-5. Taking rows4-6 and columns3-5:\n\nRow4: columns3-5:8,3,3 \u2192 [8,3,3]\n\nRow5: columns3-5:4,3,3 \u2192 [4,3,3]\n\nRow6: columns3-5:4,8,4 \u2192 [4,8,4]\n\nBut this forms:\n\n[8,3,3]\n\n[4,3,3]\n\n[4,8,4]\n\nWhich doesn't match the training examples' pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is:\n\n[0,0,8]\n\n[0,4,8]\n\n[8,3,3]\n\nBut I'm not confident.\n\nAlternatively, looking back at the training examples, both outputs have a 1 or a 7 in the top-right corner, and a 4 or 2 in the bottom-right. Maybe it's the first, middle, and last elements of each non-zero row. For example0's output:\n\nRow0:0,0,7 \u2192 perhaps the last non-zero of row2.\n\nRow1:0,6,8 \u2192 middle and next of row3.\n\nRow2:7,8,4 \u2192 first non-zero of row4.\n\nIn test input:\n\nRow2's last non-zero is8 \u2192 output row0: [0,0,8].\n\nRow3's elements are4,4,8. Middle is4, next is8. So row1: [0,4,8].\n\nRow4's elements are8,8,3. First non-zero is8. So row2: [8,8,3].\n\nSo the output would be:\n\n[0,0,8]\n\n[0,4,8]\n\n[8,8,3]\n\nBut the training example1's output has [1,0,0], which is the first element of row1. So maybe this isn't consistent.\n\nAt this point, I think I need to make a guess based on the examples. The key seems to be that in each example, the output is the 3x3 grid taken from the central part of the input's non-zero area, possibly shifted to the top-left. For example0, the output is the central 3x3 of the input's diamond structure. So maybe for the test input, the output is:\n\n[0,4,8]\n\n[8,3,3]\n\n[4,8,4]\n\nBut how?\n\nAlternatively, considering the symmetry of the test input, perhaps the output is the central 3x3 where the numbers are arranged as follows. Let's imagine the test input's non-zero elements form a sort of hourglass. The center has 3s. The output would be:\n\n[4,8,4]\n\n[8,3,3]\n\n[4,3,8]\n\nBut this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the test input's row3: [0,0,0,4,4,8,4,0,0,0]. The middle part is4,4,8. Row4: [0,0,8,8,3,3,4,0,0,0]. Middle part is8,3,3. Row5: [0,0,0,4,3,3,8,8,0,0]. Middle part is3,3,8. So if we take rows3-5 and columns4-6, we get:\n\nRow3:4,8,4 \u2192 columns4-6:8,4?\n\nWait, row3 is columns3-6:4,4,8,4. Columns4-6 are4,8,4. So row3:4,8,4.\n\nRow4: columns4-6:3,3,4.\n\nRow5: columns4-6:3,8,8.\n\nSo the 3x3 would be:\n\n4 8 4\n\n3 3 4\n\n3 8 8\n\nBut how does this relate to the training examples? Not sure.\n\nAnother Idea: Maybe the output is a 3x3 grid that captures the first three non-zero elements from each of the first three non-zero rows, but shifted to the left.\n\nFor example, in test input:\n\nRow2: non-zero element at column5 \u21928. So output row0: [0,0,8].\n\nRow3: non-zero starts at column3 \u21924,4,8. Output row1: [4,4,8].\n\nRow4: starts at column2 \u21928,8,3. Output row2: [8,8,3].\n\nSo output would be:\n\n[0,0,8]\n\n[4,4,8]\n\n[8,8,3]\n\nBut example0's output starts with [0,0,7], which would be row2's 7s. Similarly, this test case's row2 has 8. So this could fit. But example1's output starts with [1,0,0], which is row1's first non-zero element (1) and then zeros, which doesn't fit this pattern. So maybe this isn't the case.\n\nBut in example1, the first non-zero row is row1. So output row0 is [1,0,0], which is row1's elements1,2,3:1,0,0. Then row2 of input has non-zero elements starting at column2:3,6,5. So output row1 is [3,6,5], but the actual output is [0,3,6]. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, in example1, output row0 is row1's non-zero elements:1 and another 1. But output row0 is [1,0,0]. So maybe taking the first three elements of the row. In row1, the elements are [0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0]. First three elements:0,1,0. But output row0 is [1,0,0]. Not matching.\n\nThis is really challenging. I think I need to make an educated guess based on the training examples.\n\nIn example0's output, the numbers seem to be the first three non-zero elements from the first three non-zero rows, but shifted right. For example:\n\nRow2's first non-zero elements are at columns4 and5 (7,7). Output row0 has 7 in the third position.\n\nRow3's first non-zero is at column3 (6), then 8,8. Output row1 has 6 in the second position and 8 in the third.\n\nRow4's first non-zero is at column2 (7), then8,4. Output row2 has7,8,4.\n\nSo perhaps, for each non-zero row, the elements are placed in the output row starting from the position corresponding to their column. For example0:\n\nRow2's 7s are at columns4 and5. Since the output has 3 columns, maybe 4 mod 3 = 1, so start at position1. But output row0 is [0,0,7]. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, the output is formed by taking each non-zero row's non-zero elements and placing them in the output row, centering them. For example, in row2 of example0, there are two 7s. Centered in a 3x3 grid would be [0,7,7]. But output row0 is [0,0,7]. Not sure.\n\nAt this point, I think the most plausible pattern is that the output is the 3x3 grid formed by taking the first three non-zero elements of the first three non-zero rows, centered in the output row. For example:\n\nIn example0:\n\nRow2 has two 7s. Output row0: [0,0,7] (assuming the last one is taken).\n\nRow3 has 6,8,8. Output row1: [0,6,8].\n\nRow4 has7,8,4. Output row2: [7,8,4].\n\nIn example1:\n\nRow1 has 1 at position1. Output row0: [1,0,0].\n\nRow2 has 3,6,5. Output row1: [0,3,6].\n\nRow3 has5,2,2. Output row2: [0,5,2].\n\nSo the pattern seems to be: for each of the first three non-zero rows in the input, take the first three non-zero elements (padding with zeros if necessary) and place them in the corresponding output row, right-aligned. For example0's row2 has two non-zero elements (7,7). The output row0 has them right-aligned: [0,0,7]. Row3 has three non-zero elements (6,8,8), output row1 is [0,6,8]. Row4 has three non-zero elements (7,8,4), output row2 is [7,8,4]. Similarly for example1.\n\nApplying this to the test input:\n\nFirst three non-zero rows are row2, row3, row4.\n\nRow2: elements are [0,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0]. Non-zero elements:8. So output row0 would be [0,0,8].\n\nRow3: elements [0,0,0,4,4,8,4,0,0,0]. Non-zero elements:4,4,8,4. First three non-zero:4,4,8. Output row1: [4,4,8].\n\nRow4: elements [0,0,8,8,3,3,4,0,0,0]. Non-zero elements:8,8,3,3,4. First three non-zero:8,8,3. Output row2: [8,8,3].\n\nSo the output would be:\n\n[0,0,8]\n\n[4,4,8]\n\n[8,8,3]\n\nBut looking back at example0's output, this pattern holds. For example, row3 of input example0 has non-zero elements6,8,8,6. The first three are6,8,8. Output row1 is [0,6,8], which is missing one 8. Hmm. So maybe the output takes only the first three non-zero elements and right-aligns them. For example, row3 of example0:6,8,8. Output row1 would be [6,8,8]. But the actual output is [0,6,8]. So this doesn't fit.\n\nWait, example0's row3 has non-zero elements at columns3,4,5,6:6,8,8,6. The first three non-zero elements are6,8,8. But the output row1 is [0,6,8]. So the output row1 is [0,6,8], which is different from the first three non-zero elements. So this suggests that the pattern is not simply taking the first three non-zero elements.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output rows are the first three non-zero elements from each of the first three non-zero rows, left-aligned. But example0's row2 has 7,7. So output row0 would be [7,7,0]. But actual output is [0,0,7]. So this also doesn't fit.\n\nAnother possible pattern: the output is formed by taking the three elements from each non-zero row that are closest to the center. For example0's row2 has 7,7 at columns4 and5 (center columns are4.5). So closest to center are columns4 and5. Take the three elements around there. Since it's two elements, maybe pad with zero. So output row0: [7,7,0]. But example0's output is [0,0,7]. Not matching.\n\nAlternatively, for each non-zero row, take the elements that are in the center columns. For example, in a 10-column grid, the center columns are4,5. So take columns3,4,5. For example0's row2: columns3,4,5:0,7,7 \u2192 output row0:0,7,7. But the actual output is [0,0,7]. Not sure.\n\nAfter struggling for a while, I think the correct approach is to look for the output as the 3x3 grid formed by the three central elements of the three central rows of the input.\n\nIn example0:\n\nCentral rows are 4,5,6 (indices4,5,6).\n\nRow4: columns4-6:4,4,8\n\nRow5: same as row4.\n\nRow6: columns4-6:8,8,6\n\nBut the output is different. So this isn't the case.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and lack of progress, I'll proceed to make an educated guess based on the examples.\n\nIn example0's output, the first row comes from the first non-zero row (row2), taking the rightmost non-zero element (7). The second row comes from row3, taking the middle two non-zero elements (6,8). The third row comes from row4, taking the first three non-zero elements (7,8,4).\n\nIn example1's output, the first row comes from row1's non-zero element (1), the second row from row2's non-zero elements (3,6), and the third row from row3's non-zero elements (5,2).\n\nSo for the test input:\n\nRow2 is the first non-zero row, rightmost non-zero element is8. So output row0: [0,0,8].\n\nRow3 has non-zero elements4,4,8,4. The middle elements are4,8. So output row1: [0,4,8].\n\nRow4 has non-zero elements8,8,3,3,4. The first three are8,8,3. Output row2: [8,8,3].\n\nThus, the output would be:\n\n[0,0,8]\n\n[0,4,8]\n\n[8,8,3]"
