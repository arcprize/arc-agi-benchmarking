        "cot_1": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. So, looking at the training examples, each input is a list of lists (like a matrix), and the output is another matrix where some numbers have changed. Let's see what's changing.\n\nStarting with Example 0. The input has numbers like 1, 8, 8, 7, etc. The output changes some 7s to 5s. Let's look at the first row: [1,8,8,7,7,8] becomes [1,8,8,5,5,8]. So the 7s in the middle are replaced with 5s. Similarly, in the second row, the two 7s become 5s, and the third row's leading 7 becomes 5, and the following 7s as well. But not all 7s are changed. For instance, in the third row's last element is 8, so maybe the 7s that are adjacent to 8s?\n\nWait, maybe it's about the position of the 7s. Let's check another example. In Example 1's input, the first row is [7,7,7,1], which becomes [5,5,5,1]. So all 7s in that row are turned to 5 except the last one isn't a 7. Wait, no, the last is 1. So maybe any 7 that is not followed by an 8? Or perhaps when 7 is followed by another 7 or 1?\n\nWait, maybe the rule is that every 7 that is not part of a sequence where 7 is followed by 8 is changed to 5. Let's see. In Example 0, the 7s that are replaced are followed by 7 or 1, perhaps. Let's check the first input row: [1,8,8,7,7,8]. The two 7s are followed by 7 and then 8. So the first 7 is followed by 7, which becomes 5, and the next 7 is followed by 8. Wait, but in the output, both 7s become 5. So that doesn't fit. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe any occurrence of 7 that is not immediately followed by an 8 gets changed to 5. Let's test that. In Example 0's first input row: the 7s are at positions 3 and 4 (0-based). The first 7 is followed by another 7, which is not 8, so it changes. The next 7 is followed by 8, so according to the rule, it should remain. But in the output, both are 5. So that contradicts. So maybe that's not the rule.\n\nLooking at Example 1's input first row [7,7,7,1]. All 7s are changed to 5. None of them are followed by 8. The next element after the last 7 is 1. So they all change. The second row in Example 1's input is [1,8,1,7]. The 7 is at the end. In the output, it's replaced with 5. So maybe any 7 that is not followed by an 8? Because the 7 here is the last element, so there's no next element, so it's replaced. Similarly, in Example 0's first row, the last 7 is followed by 8, so that 7 would stay as 7, but in the output, it's replaced. Wait, the input is [1,8,8,7,7,8]. The fourth element is 7, followed by 7, then fifth 7 is followed by 8. So according to that rule, the first 7 (position 3) would be changed, but the second 7 (position4) is followed by 8, so remains. But in the output, both are 5. So that rule doesn't fit.\n\nHmm, maybe it's the other way around: 7s that are followed by 8 are changed. Wait, no. Let's see. In Example 0's first row, the last 7 is followed by 8, and it's changed to 5. So that doesn't fit. So maybe the presence of an 8 in the same row or column affects it.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 7s are replaced by 5s unless they are adjacent (either left, right, up, down) to an 8. Let's check.\n\nTake Example 0's first input row: [1,8,8,7,7,8]. The 7s are at positions 3,4. Let's see their neighbors. The 7 at position 3 is next to 8 (position2) and 7 (position4). So maybe adjacent to 8. The 7 at position4 is next to 7 (position3) and 8 (position5). So both 7s have at least one adjacent 8. But in the output, both are changed to 5. So that contradicts the idea that 7s adjacent to 8 remain. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 7s that are not part of a pair with 8. Wait, maybe 7s that are not directly preceded or followed by 8. Let's check again.\n\nExample 0 first input row: the 7s are at positions 3 and 4. The 7 at position3 is preceded by 8 (position2) and followed by 7. So maybe only 7s that are not adjacent to 8. But then, position3 is adjacent to 8. But in the output, it's changed. So that's not it.\n\nAnother approach: look at the outputs. All the 7s in the input are converted to 5s except maybe those that are next to 8s in some way. Wait, in Example 0's third input row: [7,1,1,7,7,8]. The first 7 becomes 5. The next two 7s (positions3 and4) are changed to 5, and the last 7 is followed by 8. In the output, all 7s are 5 except maybe the one next to 8? But in that last 7 (position4), the next element is 8, so perhaps the 7 is adjacent to 8 on the right. But it's changed to 5. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe 7s are always changed to 5s unless they are part of a sequence that starts with 8. Or maybe the 7s that are adjacent to 8 are kept as 7? No, because in Example 0's first input row, the 7s are next to 8 and are changed. Hmm.\n\nAlternative idea: Maybe the transformation is replacing 7 with 5 in all positions except where the 7 is the first or last element of a row. Wait, Example 0's first input row: the first element is 1, last is 8. The 7s are in the middle. Changed. In Example 1's first input row [7,7,7,1], all 7s are changed to 5. The first element is 7, but in the output it's 5. So that's not it.\n\nWait, looking at the outputs again: in all the examples, every occurrence of 7 in the input is changed to 5 except when... maybe when the 7 is adjacent (horizontally or vertically) to an 8. Let's check this.\n\nTake Example 0's first row: [1,8,8,7,7,8]. The 7s are at positions 3 and4. Position3's left neighbor is 8 (position2), so adjacent to 8. But in output, it's 5. So that contradicts.\n\nHmm. Let's take another example. Example 1's input has the third row [7,1,1,7]. Output is [5,1,1,5]. So all 7s are changed. But in the input row, the first 7 is next to 1, and the last 7 is next to 1. So maybe there's a different rule.\n\nWait, maybe the 7s are replaced with 5s unless they are part of a group that includes an 8. Or perhaps the 7s that are in the same row or column as an 8 are kept. No, in Example 0, the 7s are in the same row as 8s but are still changed.\n\nAnother angle: Let's look for other patterns. The outputs have 5 replacing 7 in some positions. Are there any other numbers changing? Let's check. In Example 0's input and output:\n\nOriginal input rows:\n\n[1, 8, 8, 7, 7, 8]\n[1, 1, 7, 7, 1, 8]\n[7, 1, 1, 7, 7, 8]\n\nOutput:\n\n[1,8,8,5,5,8]\n[1,1,5,5,1,8]\n[5,1,1,5,5,8]\n\nSo all 7s become 5s. Wait, is that possible? Let's check each example. In Example 0, every 7 in the input is replaced with 5 in the output. Let's count:\n\nExample 0 input has 7s:\n\nFirst row: two 7s \u2192 output two 5s.\n\nSecond row: two 7s \u2192 two 5s.\n\nThird row: three 7s \u2192 three 5s.\n\nWait, but in the third row of the input, the first element is 7, which becomes 5. Then there's a 7 in position3 and4. All become 5.\n\nIn Example 1's input:\n\nFirst row: three 7s \u2192 three 5s.\n\nSecond row: one 7 \u2192 5.\n\nThird row: two 7s \u2192 two 5s.\n\nExample 2's input:\n\nFirst row: one 7 \u2192 5.\n\nSecond row: no 7s in input? Let me check. The input is:\n\n[1, 8, 1, 7, 1] \u2192 7 becomes 5.\n\nSecond row [7, 8, 8, 1, 1] \u2192 the first element is 7, which becomes 5 in output.\n\nThird row [7, 1, 8, 8, 7] \u2192 first and last 7s become 5.\n\nSo in all examples, every 7 in the input is replaced by 5. But wait, in Example 0's third row input is [7,1,1,7,7,8]. The output is [5,1,1,5,5,8]. So all 7s are replaced. But in the test input, perhaps this is the case.\n\nWait, but looking at the outputs, all 7s are changed to 5. Let's check again:\n\nIn Example 0's input, all 7s are replaced by 5. So for example, the third row's first element is 7 \u2192 5, the next 7s become 5.\n\nSimilarly in Example 1, every 7 in input becomes 5. So perhaps the pattern is simply replacing all instances of 7 with 5. But that seems too straightforward. Let me check again.\n\nYes, in every training example, every occurrence of 7 in the input is replaced with 5 in the output. Let's see:\n\nExample 0: input has 7s in all three rows. Output has 5s in their places.\n\nExample 1: input has 7s; output 5s.\n\nExample 2: same. So maybe the pattern is simply replace 7 with 5.\n\nBut why would that be the case? Let me check the test input.\n\nTest input:\n\n[1,7,7,1,7]\n[8,1,7,7,7]\n[8,7,1,7,8]\n\nIf the pattern is replacing all 7s with 5s, then the output would be:\n\n[1,5,5,1,5]\n[8,1,5,5,5]\n[8,5,1,5,8]\n\nBut let's check if that matches the training examples. For instance, in Example 2's input:\n\n[7, 8, 8, 1, 1] becomes [5,8,8,1,1]. So yes, 7 \u21925.\n\nSo the pattern seems to be replacing every 7 with 5. So the answer should be the test input with all 7s replaced by 5.\n\nBut let me double-check. For example, in the first example's input:\n\nInput in example 1:\n\n[7,7,7,1] \u2192 output [5,5,5,1]\n\nYes, 7s \u21925s.\n\nYes, this seems to be the case. So the answer for the test input is to replace all 7s with 5s. Let's apply that.\n\nTest input:\n\nRow 0: [1,7,7,1,7] \u2192 [1,5,5,1,5]\n\nRow 1: [8,1,7,7,7] \u2192 [8,1,5,5,5]\n\nRow 2: [8,7,1,7,8] \u2192 [8,5,1,5,8]\n\nSo the output should be these three rows.",

        "cot_2": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. So, looking at the training examples, I need to see how the input lists are transformed into the output lists. Let me go through each example step by step.\n\nStarting with Example 0. The input has three arrays. Let's compare the input and output. The first array input is [1,8,8,7,7,8], and output becomes [1,8,8,5,5,8]. Hmm, so the 7s turned into 5s here. Similarly, in the second input array [1,1,7,7,1,8], the 7s become 5s again. The third array [7,1,1,7,7,8] becomes [5,1,1,5,5,8]. So the 7s are being replaced by 5s. But wait, maybe not all 7s? Let me check if there's a condition.\n\nLooking at the first example's input arrays. Let's see the first array's 7s are in positions 3 and 4 (0-based index 3 and 4), which are both 7s. They become 5s. In the second array, the 7s at positions 2 and 3 become 5s. Third array's first 7 becomes 5, and the next two 7s also become 5. So all 7s are turned into 5s? But wait, let's check the other examples to confirm.\n\nExample 1's input arrays. First array [7,7,7,1] becomes [5,5,5,1]. So all 7s are replaced by 5s. Second array [1,8,1,7] becomes [1,8,1,5]. Third array [7,1,1,7] becomes [5,1,1,5]. So again, all 7s replaced by 5s. But wait, in Example 2's input, let's see.\n\nExample 2's input: first array [1,8,1,7,1] \u2192 output [1,8,1,5,1]. So the 7 becomes 5. Second input array [7,8,8,1,1] becomes [5,8,8,1,1]. Third array [7,1,8,8,7] becomes [5,1,8,8,5]. So all 7s are replaced by 5s here as well. So the initial thought is that every 7 in the input is replaced by 5 in the output. But wait, let's check if there are any exceptions.\n\nWait a minute, looking at Example 0's third input array: [7,1,1,7,7,8] becomes [5,1,1,5,5,8]. All 7s are 5s. Similarly, all examples seem to replace 7 with 5. So the pattern is simply replacing all instances of 7 with 5. But that seems too straightforward. Let me check if there's any case where a 7 isn't replaced.\n\nLooking at Example 2's third input array: [7,1,8,8,7] \u2192 output [5,1,8,8,5]. Both 7s are replaced. In the test input, for instance, the first array is [1,7,7,1,7], so replacing all 7s with 5s would make [1,5,5,1,5]. Let's see if that matches the possible output.\n\nWait, but let's look at the outputs again. Wait, in Example 0's output, the first array is [1,8,8,5,5,8]. The original had 7s in positions 3 and 4, so yes. So replacing all 7s with 5s. But wait, in the test input, maybe there's another pattern. Let me check again.\n\nWait, but maybe there's a condition based on the position of the 7s. For example, maybe only 7s that are adjacent to certain numbers. Let's check the training examples again.\n\nIn Example 0's first input array: [1,8,8,7,7,8]. The 7s are between 8 and 7, etc. But in the output, they are replaced. So maybe it's not about adjacency. Alternatively, perhaps it's every 7 except when it's part of a certain sequence.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's about the number of 7s in a row. For instance, in Example 0's first input array, there are two 7s in a row, which become 5s. Similarly, in Example 1's first array, three 7s in a row. But in the outputs, all are replaced. So maybe that's not it.\n\nWait another thought: maybe 7s are replaced by 5s only if they are not followed by an 8. Let me check. In Example 0's first input array, the 7s are followed by 7 and 8. The last 7 is followed by 8. Wait, no. The array is [1,8,8,7,7,8]. The 7s are at positions 3 and 4. The next element after 7 at position 4 is 8. But both are replaced. So that's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 7s that are part of a group of two or more are replaced. But in Example 0's second input array, the 7s are in positions 2 and 3 (two 7s), replaced. But in Example 1's second input array, there's a single 7 at position 3, which is replaced by 5. So that doesn't fit.\n\nHmm, perhaps there's another pattern. Let me think about other possibilities. Looking at the outputs, perhaps the numbers are being modified based on their neighbors. For example, maybe a 7 is replaced by 5 if it's adjacent to a 1 or an 8. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's not the 7s that are being replaced, but the sum of certain elements. Let me check if the sum changes. For example, in Example 0's first input array, the sum of the input is 1+8+8+7+7+8 = 39. Output sum is 1+8+8+5+5+8 = 35. The difference is 4 (because two 7s replaced by 5s, each contributing -2). Similarly, in the first example's input array [7,7,7,1], sum is 7+7+7+1=22. Output is 5*3 +1=16. Difference is 6, which is 3*2, each 7 replaced by 5 (each 7 is -2). So all 7s replaced by 5s. That seems to hold. So perhaps the pattern is simply replacing every occurrence of 7 with 5 in all arrays.\n\nBut wait, let's check the Test Input. The first array is [1,7,7,1,7]. If replacing all 7s with 5s, it would become [1,5,5,1,5]. Second array [8,1,7,7,7] becomes [8,1,5,5,5]. Third array [8,7,1,7,8] becomes [8,5,1,5,8]. Let's see if that matches the examples.\n\nBut looking at the training examples, all 7s are replaced by 5s. So maybe the answer is just that. But let's check for possible exceptions. For instance, in Example 2's third input array [7,1,8,8,7], the output is [5,1,8,8,5]. Both 7s are replaced. So yes, all 7s become 5s.\n\nTherefore, applying this pattern to the test input:\n\nTest input:\n\n[1,7,7,1,7] \u2192 [1,5,5,1,5]\n[8,1,7,7,7] \u2192 [8,1,5,5,5]\n[8,7,1,7,8] \u2192 [8,5,1,5,8]\n\nSo the output arrays would have all 7s replaced with 5s. That seems to fit the training examples. Let me double-check to make sure there isn't a more complex pattern. But according to the examples, every 7 is turned into 5. So the answer should be as I outlined."
