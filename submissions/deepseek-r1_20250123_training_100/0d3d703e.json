        "cot_1": "Okay, let's tackle this puzzle. So, the task is to figure out the pattern that transforms the input arrays into the output arrays. All the training examples have three identical rows each with three numbers. The output also has three identical rows, each with three numbers. So the transformation is applied to each element of the input array, and the same transformation is applied to each row since all rows are the same.\n\nLet's look at Example 0 first. Input is [3,1,2] repeated three times. Output is [4,5,6]. Let's see each element. 3 becomes 4, which is +1. 1 becomes 5\u2014that's +4. 2 becomes 6, which is +4. Wait, that doesn't fit a simple addition. Hmm. Maybe it's a different operation.\n\nExample 1: Input [2,3,8] becomes [6,4,9]. Let's see each element. 2\u21926: difference +4. 3\u21924: +1. 8\u21929: +1. So for the first element, it's +4, others +1. But maybe there's another pattern here.\n\nWait, maybe looking at digits. Let's check if it's something with summing digits or something else. Let's see Example 0: 3 becomes 4. 3+1=4? Not sure. 1 becomes 5. 1+4=5. 2 becomes 6. 2+4=6. Wait, maybe the first element is increased by 1, others by 4. But that doesn't hold for other examples.\n\nExample1: 2 becomes 6. 2 +4=6. 3 becomes 4: 3 +1=4. 8 becomes 9: 8 +1=9. So first element is +4, others +1. Let's check other examples.\n\nExample2: Input [5,8,6] \u2192 [1,9,2]. Let's see 5\u21921. That's -4. 8\u21929: +1. 6\u21922: -4. Hmm. So here first and third elements are -4, middle is +1. So maybe the pattern varies per position.\n\nWait, maybe each position has a certain transformation. Let's check all examples:\n\nLooking at the first elements across all examples:\n\nExample0: 3 \u21924 (+1)\nExample1: 2 \u21926 (+4)\nExample2:5 \u21921 (-4)\nExample3:9 \u21928 (-1)\n\nHmm. These don't follow a straightforward pattern. Similarly, middle elements:\n\nExample0:1 \u21925 (+4)\nExample1:3 \u21924 (+1)\nExample2:8 \u21929 (+1)\nExample3:4 \u21923 (-1)\n\nThird elements:\n\nExample0:2\u21926 (+4)\nExample1:8\u21929 (+1)\nExample2:6\u21922 (-4)\nExample3:2\u21926 (+4)\n\nThis seems inconsistent. Maybe another approach. Let's look at possible mathematical operations: perhaps multiplication, modulo, or digit sums.\n\nWait, let's try another angle. What if each digit is transformed by (10 - original) mod 9 or something like that? Let's test:\n\nFor Example0:\n\n3 \u2192 10-3=7. 7 mod 9 is 7. Doesn't match 4.\n\nAlternatively, 3 \u2192 3+1=4 (which works here). But in Example1, 2+4=6. So maybe first element: 3+1=4, 2+4=6, 5-4=1, 9-1=8. That doesn't seem to follow a pattern. Maybe it's related to the position.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the sum of the elements. For Example0 input, sum is 3+1+2=6. Output sum is 4+5+6=15. 15 is 6 +9. Example1 input sum:2+3+8=13. Output sum:6+4+9=19. 19-13=6. Example2 input sum:5+8+6=19. Output sum:1+9+2=12. Difference is -7. Example3 input sum:9+4+2=15. Output sum:8+3+6=17. Difference +2. So the sum differences are varying, which doesn't help.\n\nAnother idea: maybe each digit is replaced by the sum of the other two digits in the row. Let's check:\n\nExample0 input: [3,1,2]. For 3: 1+2=3. But output is 4. Doesn't match. So that's not it.\n\nWait, maybe each digit is replaced by a digit that when added to the original gives 9? Let's see:\n\n3 + 6 =9 \u2192 output would be 6, but in Example0, 3\u21924. So no.\n\nAlternatively, 3 +1 =4, but 1+4=5, 2+4=6. So maybe each element is added by a specific number. But in the first example, first element is added by 4, others by 1 and 1. Example2, first element is 5\u21921: subtract 4, third is 6\u21922: subtract 4. Middle is +1. Example3: first 9\u21928 (-1), second 4\u21923 (-1), third 2\u21926 (+4). So perhaps the transformation depends on the position of the element in the triplet.\n\nLooking at the positions:\n\nLet's index as position 0,1,2.\n\nLooking at each position across examples:\n\nPosition0:\n\nEx0:3\u21924 (+1)\nEx1:2\u21926 (+4)\nEx2:5\u21921 (-4)\nEx3:9\u21928 (-1)\n\nPosition1:\n\nEx0:1\u21925 (+4)\nEx1:3\u21924 (+1)\nEx2:8\u21929 (+1)\nEx3:4\u21923 (-1)\n\nPosition2:\n\nEx0:2\u21926 (+4)\nEx1:8\u21929 (+1)\nEx2:6\u21922 (-4)\nEx3:2\u21926 (+4)\n\nHmm. So for position 0:\n\nThe changes are +1, +4, -4, -1. These look like they could be adding 5 mod 10 or something. Wait, 3+1=4, 2+4=6, 5-4=1 (5+(-4)=1), 9-1=8. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the sum of the digits in the input array is related. Let's check:\n\nEx0 input sum:3+1+2=6. Output sum:15. 15-6=9. 9 is a multiple of 9. Ex1 sum:13, output sum 19. Difference 6. Ex2 sum:19, output 12. Difference -7. Ex3 sum:15, output 17. Difference +2. Doesn't seem consistent.\n\nAnother approach: Maybe each element is transformed based on its own value. For example, 3 becomes 4. 1 becomes 5. 2 becomes 6. Let's see if there's a pattern here. For instance, 3 * 1 +1=4. 1 * 4 +1=5. 2*2 +2=6. Not obvious.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's related to the digits in a different way. Let's think of each number as a digit, maybe adding a certain number and wrapping around modulo 10. For example, 3 +1=4. 1+4=5. 2+4=6. But then in Ex1, 2+4=6, 3+1=4, 8+1=9. So for position0, add 4. Position1, add1. Position2, add1. Wait, Ex1: positions 0: +4, 1: +1, 2: +1. That gives 6,4,9. But Ex0's positions: 0: +1, 1: +4, 2:+4. Hmm. Maybe the transformation varies per position but in a cycle. Let's look at the examples again.\n\nWait, perhaps the transformation for each position depends on the position index. Let's see:\n\nFor Example0:\n\nPosition0: 3 \u21924 (diff +1)\nPosition1:1 \u21925 (diff +4)\nPosition2:2 \u21926 (diff +4)\n\nExample1:\n\nPosition0:2\u21926 (+4)\nPosition1:3\u21924 (+1)\nPosition2:8\u21929 (+1)\n\nExample2:\n\nPosition0:5\u21921 (-4)\nPosition1:8\u21929 (+1)\nPosition2:6\u21922 (-4)\n\nExample3:\n\nPosition0:9\u21928 (-1)\nPosition1:4\u21923 (-1)\nPosition2:2\u21926 (+4)\n\nHmm. So for position0, the differences are +1, +4, -4, -1. Position1: +4, +1, +1, -1. Position2: +4, +1, -4, +4. This seems random. Maybe there's a pattern based on the value of the element.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each number is being mapped to a digit that's part of a sequence. For example, 3\u21924, 2\u21926, 5\u21921, 9\u21928. Let's see:\n\n3 maps to 4 (next number)\n2 maps to 6 (which is 2*3)\n5 maps to 1 (5-4=1)\n9 maps to 8 (previous number)\n\nNot obvious. Another approach: think of each digit as part of a clock, maybe adding a certain number of hours. For example, 3 \u21924 (add 1), 2\u21926 (add 4), 5\u21921 (add 8 (since 5+8=13\u21921 mod12)), 9\u21928 (add 11 (since 9+11=20\u21928 mod12)). Not sure.\n\nWait, maybe the transformation for each element is 10 - original, but adjusted. Let's see:\n\n3\u21927, but output is 4. No. 10-3=7, which is not 4.\n\nAlternatively, 3 \u2192 (3 +1) mod 10 =4. That works. 1\u21925: (1+4) mod10=5. 2\u21926: (2+4) mod10=6. So in Ex0, position0: +1, positions1 and2: +4. Then in Ex1, positions0: +4, positions1 and2: +1. Ex2: position0: -4 (which is +6 mod10), positions1: +1, position2: -4. Ex3: position0: -1 (which is +9 mod10), position1: -1, position2:+4.\n\nThis seems too inconsistent. Maybe the pattern is that each element is transformed by adding 1, then 4, then 4 for the first example. But the next example adds 4,1,1. The third example adds -4,1,-4. Fourth example -1,-1,4. Not sure.\n\nAnother angle: Maybe the output numbers are the sum of the input numbers in a certain way. For example, in Ex0, input is three 3s, three 1s, three 2s. Output is all 4,5,6. So maybe each output number is the sum of the three numbers in the input's column. But in Ex0, each column has three 3s, sum 9 \u2192 but output is 4. Hmm, 9 mod5=4. Not sure. Alternatively, 3+1+2=6 \u2192 output first element 4. 6-2=4? Not sure.\n\nWait, the input arrays are all the same in each example, so perhaps each row is the same and the transformation is per element. Let's think of each input as a triplet [a, b, c] repeated three times, and the output is [x, y, z] repeated three times. So the problem reduces to figuring out how a,b,c become x,y,z.\n\nSo for Ex0: [3,1,2] \u2192 [4,5,6]. So 3\u21924, 1\u21925, 2\u21926.\n\nLooking at these mappings:\n\n3 \u21924: difference +1\n1 \u21925: +4\n2 \u21926: +4\n\nEx1: [2,3,8] \u2192 [6,4,9]\n\n2\u21926: +4\n3\u21924: +1\n8\u21929: +1\n\nEx2: [5,8,6] \u2192 [1,9,2]\n\n5\u21921: -4\n8\u21929: +1\n6\u21922: -4\n\nEx3: [9,4,2] \u2192 [8,3,6]\n\n9\u21928: -1\n4\u21923: -1\n2\u21926: +4\n\nHmm. Now, looking for a pattern in how each element is transformed:\n\nFor the first element:\n\n3\u21924 (+1)\n2\u21926 (+4)\n5\u21921 (-4)\n9\u21928 (-1)\n\nSecond element:\n\n1\u21925 (+4)\n3\u21924 (+1)\n8\u21929 (+1)\n4\u21923 (-1)\n\nThird element:\n\n2\u21926 (+4)\n8\u21929 (+1)\n6\u21922 (-4)\n2\u21926 (+4)\n\nThis is a bit confusing. Maybe the transformation depends on the value of the element. For example:\n\nIf the element is even or odd, maybe different operations. Let's check:\n\nFirst elements:\n\n3 (odd) \u2192 +1 \u21924 (even)\n2 (even)\u2192+4\u21926 (even)\n5 (odd)\u2192-4\u21921 (odd)\n9 (odd)\u2192-1\u21928 (even)\nSo no clear even/odd pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the digits in some way. Let's see:\n\nFor example, 3\u21924: adding 1. 2\u21926: adding4. 5\u21921: subtract 4. 9\u21928: subtract 1. Maybe the transformation alternates between adding and subtracting, but it's not clear.\n\nAnother idea: look at the digits in terms of 10's complement. For example, 3's complement is 7 (10-3=7). But 3\u21924, not 7. Not matching.\n\nWait, maybe the sum of the digits in each output element equals a certain value. Let's check:\n\nEx0:4+5+6=15. Ex1:6+4+9=19. Ex2:1+9+2=12. Ex3:8+3+6=17. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each output digit is a result of multiplying the input digit by a certain number and then taking modulo 10. For example, 3* something mod10=4. Let's see:\n\n3 * x \u22614 mod10. So x could be 8 (3*8=24 mod10=4). Then 1*8=8 mod10=8. But output is 5. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAnother angle: Maybe the output digits are the sum of the input digits in a different arrangement. For example, Ex0: input 3,1,2. Sum is 6. Output sum 15. 15-6=9. Maybe each digit is increased by 3 (but 3\u21924, which is +1). No.\n\nAlternatively, think of the output digits as being the input digits with some permutation. For example, in Ex0, 3,1,2 \u21924,5,6. 3+1=4, 1+4=5, 2+4=6. But in Ex1, 2+4=6, 3+1=4, 8+1=9. So for Ex0, first element +1, others +4. Ex1, first +4, others +1. Ex2, first and third -4, middle +1. Ex3, first and second -1, third +4. Not consistent.\n\nWait, maybe the transformation is based on the sum of the digits in the input array. For example, Ex0 sum is 6. Output digits sum to 15. 15-6=9. Ex1 sum 13, output sum 19. 19-13=6. Ex2 sum 19, output 12. Difference -7. Ex3 sum 15, output 17. Difference +2. Not a clear pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output elements are derived by performing operations based on the position and value. Let's think of each element's position (0,1,2) and its value.\n\nFor example, in Ex0:\n\nPosition0:3 \u21924. Maybe 3 + (0+1) =4. So pos0:3+1=4.\n\nPosition1:1 \u21925. 1 + (1+3) =5? 1+4=5. Where does the 4 come from?\n\nPosition2:2 \u21926. 2+4=6.\n\nAlternatively, pos0:3*1 +1=4, pos1:1*4 +1=5, pos2:2*2 +2=6. Not sure.\n\nThis is getting tricky. Let's try to look for a pattern in each element's transformation across the examples.\n\nFirst elements:\n\n3\u21924 (diff +1)\n2\u21926 (diff +4)\n5\u21921 (diff -4)\n9\u21928 (diff -1)\n\nLooking at these differences: +1, +4, -4, -1. Hmm, maybe the differences are following a pattern where they cycle through adding 1, then 4, then subtracting 4, then subtracting 1. But why?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the first element's transformation is based on its value. For example:\n\n3 \u2192 3 +1=4\n2 \u2192 2 +4=6\n5 \u21925-4=1\n9 \u21929-1=8\n\nBut what's the logic here? Let's see if there's a pattern between the input value and the difference. For 3: difference +1, 2: +4, 5: -4, 9: -1.\n\nLooking for a relationship between input and difference:\n\n3 \u21921 (maybe 3 mod4=3, difference 1? Not sure)\n2 \u21924 (2 mod4=2, difference 4)\n5 \u2192-4 (5 mod4=1, difference -4)\n9 \u2192-1 (9 mod4=1, difference -1). Not helpful.\n\nAnother idea: Maybe the transformation is based on the number of letters in the English word. For example, three (3) has five letters. Five mod10 is 5, but output is 4. No.\n\nAlternatively, think of the numbers on a phone keypad. 3 is on the third row, first column. Maybe moving down or right. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, think of each digit as a result of some operation with the others. For example, the first output digit is the sum of the second and third input digits. Let's check:\n\nEx0: second input digit is1, third is2. 1+2=3, but output is4. No.\n\nWait, maybe each output digit is the input digit plus the sum of the other two digits modulo something. For example, Ex0:4 =3 + (1+2) =6 \u21924 mod something? 6 mod5=1, but 3+1+2=6. 6 mod something to get4? Not sure.\n\nThis is getting frustrating. Let's look at all the examples again to see if there's a pattern I'm missing.\n\nExample0:\nInput:3,1,2 \u2192 Output:4,5,6\n\nExample1:\nInput:2,3,8 \u21926,4,9\n\nExample2:\nInput:5,8,6 \u21921,9,2\n\nExample3:\nInput:9,4,2 \u21928,3,6\n\nLooking at the outputs:\n\nExample0:4,5,6 \u2192 consecutive numbers.\n\nExample1:6,4,9 \u2192 not consecutive. 4,6,9 arranged as 6,4,9.\n\nExample2:1,9,2 \u2192 1,2,9 arranged as 1,9,2.\n\nExample3:8,3,6 \u2192 3,6,8 arranged as 8,3,6.\n\nWait a minute, maybe the output numbers are a permutation of the input numbers plus or minus certain values. For example, in Example0, output is [4,5,6], which are each input digits +1, +4, +4. But this doesn't hold for others.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output digits are sorted in some order. For example, in Example0 input is [3,1,2], sorted is [1,2,3]. Output is [4,5,6], sorted is [4,5,6]. So maybe output is sorted input plus 3 each. But in Example1, input sorted is [2,3,8]. Output sorted is [4,6,9]. 2+2=4, 3+3=6, 8+1=9. Not consistent.\n\nAnother approach: Let's look at the difference between input and output for each position across all examples.\n\nPosition0:\n\n3\u21924 (+1)\n2\u21926 (+4)\n5\u21921 (-4)\n9\u21928 (-1)\n\nPosition1:\n\n1\u21925 (+4)\n3\u21924 (+1)\n8\u21929 (+1)\n4\u21923 (-1)\n\nPosition2:\n\n2\u21926 (+4)\n8\u21929 (+1)\n6\u21922 (-4)\n2\u21926 (+4)\n\nWait, noticing that for position0, the differences are +1, +4, -4, -1. These look like they could be following a cycle of adding 1, then adding 4, then subtracting 4, then subtracting 1. Or maybe each difference is the previous difference multiplied by -1 each time. But not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation for each position is based on the value of the element. For example, for position0:\n\nWhen input is 3, output is 4 (3+1)\nWhen input is 2, output is6 (2+4)\nWhen input is5, output is1 (5-4)\nWhen input is9, output is8 (9-1)\n\nLooking for a pattern here: Maybe if the input is even or odd, or some other property. 3 is odd, 2 even,5 odd,9 odd. The differences are +1, +4, -4, -1. Not sure.\n\nWait, another observation: In Example0, the output numbers are 4,5,6 which are 3+1, 1+4, 2+4. Example1:2+4=6,3+1=4,8+1=9. Example2:5-4=1,8+1=9,6-4=2. Example3:9-1=8,4-1=3,2+4=6. So the pattern here seems to be that the first element is transformed by adding 1, then 4, then -4, then -1. But how does this relate to the input?\n\nAlternatively, the transformations for each position are cycling through a set of operations. For example, position0 transformations: +1, +4, -4, -1, and then repeats. But how does this cycle relate to the examples.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation for each position is based on the sum of the digits in the input array. For example, in Example0, sum is6. Maybe for sum6, the first element is +1, second +4, third +4. But Example1 sum13, different transformation.\n\nAlternatively, think of the transformations as a permutation. For instance, each input digit is mapped to a specific output digit. Let's list all possible mappings:\n\n3\u21924\n1\u21925\n2\u21926\n\n2\u21926\n3\u21924\n8\u21929\n\n5\u21921\n8\u21929\n6\u21922\n\n9\u21928\n4\u21923\n2\u21926\n\nLooking for consistency here:\n\n3\u21924, 2\u21926,5\u21921,9\u21928. So 3 and 2 map to 4 and 6 in first two examples, but then 5\u21921, 9\u21928.\n\n1\u21925, 3\u21924,8\u21929. So 1\u21925,3\u21924.\n\n8\u21929,6\u21922,2\u21926. So 8\u21929,6\u21922,2\u21926.\n\nThis seems like each digit is mapped to another digit, but there's no obvious pattern like shifting by a certain number. For example, 3\u21924, 2\u21926, 5\u21921. There's no common shift here. So maybe it's a substitution cipher. But with the examples given, perhaps there's a pattern in the substitutions.\n\nWait, maybe the output digits are the input digits multiplied by 3 modulo 10. Let's check:\n\n3*3=9 mod10=9, but output is4. No. 1*3=3 mod10=3, output is5. Doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, multiplied by 2 mod10:\n\n3*2=6 mod10=6. Output is4. Doesn't fit.\n\nAnother idea: Maybe each digit is replaced by the sum of its digits plus some value. But all digits are single digits.\n\nAlternatively, think of the digits as positions on a keypad. For example, 3 is on the third row, first column. 4 is next to it. But this might not help.\n\nWait, let's look at the outputs:\n\nExample0:4,5,6 \u2192 consecutive numbers in order.\n\nExample1:6,4,9 \u2192 not consecutive but 4,6,9.\n\nExample2:1,9,2 \u2192 1,2,9 in a different order.\n\nExample3:8,3,6 \u2192 3,6,8 in a different order.\n\nSo maybe the output is a permutation of the input digits after some operation. For example:\n\nExample0: input [3,1,2], output [4,5,6]. The outputs are not permutations of the inputs, but each is +1, +4, +4.\n\nNot permutations. So that's not it.\n\nAnother approach: Let's see if the output digits are related to the input digits via some mathematical function. For example, 3\u21924. 3 + (3 mod 2) +1=4. 3 is odd, so mod2 is1. 3+1+0=4? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, 3 squared is9, 9 mod5=4. So 3^2 mod5=4. But 1^2 mod5=1, which doesn't give5. So no.\n\nAlternatively, 3^3=27 mod10=7. No.\n\nThis is really challenging. Let me try to find another angle.\n\nLooking at the test input: [8,1,3], repeated three times. The expected output would need to follow the same pattern as the training examples.\n\nLet's look for any possible pattern in the training outputs.\n\nWait, in Example0: input [3,1,2] \u2192 output [4,5,6]. The output digits are next numbers after the input digits but shifted. For example, 3\u21924 (next), 1\u21925 (jump by4), 2\u21926 (jump by4).\n\nExample1: [2,3,8] \u2192 [6,4,9]. 2\u21926 (+4), 3\u21924 (+1), 8\u21929 (+1).\n\nExample2: [5,8,6] \u2192 [1,9,2]. 5\u21921 (-4), 8\u21929 (+1),6\u21922 (-4).\n\nExample3: [9,4,2] \u2192 [8,3,6]. 9\u21928 (-1),4\u21923 (-1),2\u21926 (+4).\n\nSo the transformation for each element seems to be either +1, +4, -1, -4. Now, looking for what determines which transformation is applied.\n\nPerhaps the transformation depends on the position in the triplet. For example:\n\nPosition0: transformations +1, +4, -4, -1 (as per the examples). So for each example, position0 cycles through these differences.\n\nExample0: pos0 +1\n\nExample1: pos0 +4\n\nExample2: pos0 -4\n\nExample3: pos0 -1\n\nThen what's next? For the test input, which would be the next example (Example4), maybe the cycle repeats. So the differences for pos0 would be +1 again. But let's check:\n\nExamples in order:\n\nExample0: pos0 +1\n\nExample1: +4\n\nExample2: -4\n\nExample3: -1\n\nSo the cycle might be +1, +4, -4, -1, and then repeats. So Example4 (test input) would be +1 again for pos0.\n\nSimilarly, for position1:\n\nExample0: +4\n\nExample1: +1\n\nExample2: +1\n\nExample3: -1\n\nNot a clear cycle. \n\nBut perhaps the transformations for each position are following a sequence. For example, pos0 transformations: +1, +4, -4, -1. If the next is +1, then for test input pos0 (8), difference would be +1 \u2192 8+1=9.\n\nPos1: transformations in order for examples:\n\nExample0: +4\n\nExample1: +1\n\nExample2: +1\n\nExample3: -1\n\nAssuming the next in sequence would be +4 again. So for test input pos1 (1), 1+4=5.\n\nPos2: transformations in order:\n\nExample0: +4\n\nExample1: +1\n\nExample2: -4\n\nExample3: +4\n\nSo the next in sequence could be +1. So for test input pos2 (3), 3+1=4.\n\nBut this is speculative and doesn't fit perfectly. Let's test this hypothesis:\n\nTest input: [8,1,3]. So applying the transformations:\n\npos0:8 \u2192 8+1=9\n\npos1:1 \u21921+4=5\n\npos2:3\u21923+1=4\n\nSo output would be [9,5,4]. But let's check if this matches any possible pattern from the examples.\n\nBut looking back at the examples, the outputs are not following this sequence. For example, pos2 in Example3 is 2\u21926, which is +4. Then the next would be +1, but that's not part of the existing examples.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformations are based on the input digit's value modulo 4.\n\nFor example:\n\nFor pos0:\n\n3 mod4=3 \u2192 difference is +1 (3+1=4)\n\n2 mod4=2 \u2192 difference +4 (2+4=6)\n\n5 mod4=1 \u2192 difference -4 (5-4=1)\n\n9 mod4=1 \u2192 difference -1 (9-1=8)\n\nSo the difference depends on input modulo4.\n\n3 mod4=3 \u2192 +1\n\n2 mod4=2 \u2192+4\n\n1 mod4=1 \u2192-4 (but in example3, input9 mod4=1 \u2192-1)\n\nHmm, this doesn't hold.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the difference is determined by the input digit divided by 2. For example:\n\n3/2=1.5 \u2192 rounded up to 2. But not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the difference is 5 minus the input digit's position. For example, pos0: 5-0=5, but 3\u21924 (difference +1). Not matching.\n\nAnother Idea: Let's consider that each transformation for a position is the sum of the other two positions in the input. For example, for pos0, the difference is the sum of pos1 and pos2 of the input.\n\nExample0: pos0 input 3. pos1+pos2=1+2=3. So 3+3=6. But output is4. No.\n\nAlternatively, difference is sum of other two positions. So for pos0: sum of pos1 and pos2.\n\nExample0:1+2=3 \u2192 difference 3. But 3\u21924 is +1. Doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, the difference is the product of the other two positions.\n\nExample0:1*2=2. 3+2=5. Output is4. No.\n\nThis is really tough. Maybe there's a different approach. Let's think of the output digits as being the digits that, when added to the input digits, form a particular sum. For example:\n\nExample0:3+4=7, 1+5=6, 2+6=8. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, product. 3*4=12, 1*5=5, 2*6=12. Not helpful.\n\nWait, another observation: In Example0, the output is [4,5,6], which are consecutive. In Example1, output is [6,4,9], which doesn't follow. Example2: [1,9,2], and Example3: [8,3,6]. No obvious consecutive pattern. But maybe there's something else.\n\nWait, let's look at the outputs for each example:\n\nExample0:4,5,6 \u2192 sum15.\n\nExample1:6,4,9 \u2192 sum19.\n\nExample2:1,9,2 \u2192 sum12.\n\nExample3:8,3,6 \u2192 sum17.\n\nNot seeing a pattern in the sums.\n\nAnother Idea: Maybe each output digit is derived by a different mathematical operation. For example, first digit: input +1, second: input +4, third: input +4. For Example0. Then for Example1, first: +4, second: +1, third: +1. For Example2: first: -4, second: +1, third: -4. For Example3: first: -1, second: -1, third: +4.\n\nIt's possible that the operation for each position varies based on some factor. Maybe the operation cycles through a sequence for each position.\n\nFor example, pos0 operations: +1, +4, -4, -1, then repeats.\n\npos1 operations: +4, +1, +1, -1, then perhaps repeats.\n\npos2 operations: +4, +1, -4, +4, then maybe +1 again.\n\nBut how do these cycles align with the test input?\n\nTest input is the fifth example (after four training examples). So pos0 would cycle back to +1 (since after four examples: +1, +4, -4, -1, then +1 again). pos1 operations: +4, +1, +1, -1, next could be +4. pos2: +4, +1, -4, +4, next could be +1.\n\nSo for test input [8,1,3]:\n\npos0:8+1=9\n\npos1:1+4=5\n\npos2:3+1=4\n\nSo output would be [9,5,4]. But looking at the training examples, the outputs are all triplets where each element is transformed, but I'm not sure if this fits.\n\nBut let's check if this aligns with any existing pattern. For example, pos0 transformation for test input would be +1 (as per the cycle), leading to 8+1=9. pos1 transformation is +4 (cycle next), 1+4=5. pos2 transformation is +1 (cycle next), 3+1=4.\n\nSo output triplet [9,5,4]. Then, since all rows are the same, the output would be three rows of [9,5,4].\n\nBut need to check if this aligns with any of the training examples' patterns. For example, in Example3, the pos2 transformation is +4 (from 2\u21926). So if the next in cycle is +1, then 3\u21924.\n\nBut is this a valid approach? It's speculative, but given the time I've spent and no clear pattern, this might be the best guess.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a pattern where each element is increased by 1, 4, 4 in the first example, then 4,1,1 in the second, then -4,1,-4, then -1,-1,4. The test input might follow this with the next step being +1, +4, +4 again. So test input [8,1,3] would become [8+1=9, 1+4=5, 3+4=7]. So output [9,5,7]. But looking at previous examples, there's no instance of the third element being +4 again. In Example3, the third element is 2\u21926 (diff +4). So maybe for test input, third element is 3\u21927 (diff +4). But how does this fit the sequence of transformations?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformations for each position are cycling through +1, +4, -4, -1. For each position, the transformation depends on the example index.\n\nFor example:\n\nExample0:\n\npos0: +1 (example0)\n\npos1: +4\n\npos2: +4\n\nExample1:\n\npos0: +4 (example1)\n\npos1: +1\n\npos2: +1\n\nExample2:\n\npos0: -4 (example2)\n\npos1: +1\n\npos2: -4\n\nExample3:\n\npos0: -1 (example3)\n\npos1: -1\n\npos2: +4\n\nSo, for example0 to example3, the pos0 transformations are +1, +4, -4, -1. For example4 (test input), pos0 would be +1 again (cycling every four examples). pos1 transformations: example0: +4, example1: +1, example2: +1, example3: -1. So for example4, pos1 transformation might be +4. pos2 transformations: example0: +4, example1: +1, example2: -4, example3: +4. For example4, pos2 might be +1.\n\nSo test input [8,1,3] would be:\n\npos0:8+1=9\n\npos1:1+4=5\n\npos2:3+1=4\n\nOutput [9,5,4]. Then, since all rows are the same, three rows of [9,5,4].\n\nBut does this fit any pattern from the examples? Let's see:\n\nIf this is the case, then:\n\nTest input:8,1,3 \u2192 output:9,5,4.\n\nBut looking at previous examples, there's no output with 9 in the first position,5 in the second, and4 in the third. However, this is just a hypothesis based on the cycling of transformations. I'm not sure if this is correct, but given the time I've invested and the lack of a clear pattern, this seems like a possible answer.",

        "cot_2": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. The input and output are both 3x3 grids of numbers. Each row in the input is the same, and the output rows are also the same. So the transformation is applied to each element of the input array, and then the result is repeated three times.\n\nLooking at Example 0:\nInput: [3,1,2] repeated three times.\nOutput: [4,5,6]. Let's see how each number changed. 3\u21924, 1\u21925, 2\u21926. Hmm, 3+1=4, 1+4=5, 2+4=6? Wait, that's inconsistent. Or maybe something else. Let's check another example.\n\nExample 1:\nInput: [2,3,8] \u2192 Output [6,4,9]. Let's see. 2\u21926 (difference +4), 3\u21924 (difference +1), 8\u21929 (difference +1). Not obvious. Maybe multiplication? 2*3=6, 3+1=4, 8+1=9? Not sure.\n\nExample 2:\nInput: [5,8,6] \u2192 [1,9,2]. 5\u21921 (difference -4 or 5-4=1), 8\u21929 (+1), 6\u21922 (-4). Hmm, maybe alternating operations. Let's check example 3.\n\nExample 3:\nInput [9,4,2] \u2192 [8,3,6]. 9-1=8, 4-1=3, 2+4=6. That doesn't fit a pattern. Alternatively, maybe sum the digits? 9\u21929, but 8? Maybe not.\n\nWait, maybe each digit is transformed based on some rule. Let's look for individual digit transformations across all examples.\n\nLooking at each position across examples:\n\nFirst element transformations:\n3 \u21924\n2 \u21926\n5 \u21921\n9 \u21928\n\nSecond element:\n1 \u21925\n3 \u21924\n8 \u21929\n4 \u21923\n\nThird element:\n2\u21926\n8\u21929\n6\u21922\n2\u21926 (Wait in example 0, third element is 2\u21926. In example 3, 2\u21926 again. Wait, example 3's input third element is 2, output is 6. So same as example 0. So maybe third element is multiplied by 3? 2*3=6, 8\u21929? 8+1=9. Hmm, no. Alternatively, maybe each digit is converted to a different digit via a substitution cipher. Let's list all possible mappings.\n\nFrom example 0:\n3\u21924\n1\u21925\n2\u21926\n\nExample1:\n2\u21926\n3\u21924\n8\u21929\n\nExample2:\n5\u21921\n8\u21929\n6\u21922\n\nExample3:\n9\u21928\n4\u21923\n2\u21926\n\nLooking for possible patterns:\n\nLooking at 3: in example0, 3\u21924. In example1, 3\u21924 again. So 3 always becomes 4? Wait no, example3's input has 4\u21923. Wait, maybe it's a rotation or some kind of substitution.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each digit is replaced by the sum of the other two digits in the row. Let's check example0: input [3,1,2]. For the first element 3, sum of 1+2=3. But output is 4. Hmm, maybe 3 +1=4. Not sure. Let's check example1: input [2,3,8]. Sum of other two is 3+8=11. 2 +11=13. But output is 6. Doesn't match.\n\nAnother idea: maybe each digit is mapped via (digit \u00d7 something) modulo 10. Let's see:\n\nFor example0:\n\n3\u21924: 3 \u00d7 x mod 10 =4. x could be 8 (3\u00d78=24 mod10=4). Then 1\u00d78=8 mod10=8, but output is 5. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, 3+1=4. 1+4=5. 2+4=6. So adding 1, 4, 4? Doesn't seem consistent.\n\nWait, looking at example1:\n\nInput [2,3,8] \u2192 [6,4,9]. Let's see:\n\n2: 6. How? 2\u00d73=6. Then 3\u21924: 3+1=4. 8\u21929:8+1=9. So first element multiplied by 3, others increased by 1. But in example0: 3\u00d71=3+1=4. 1\u00d73=3, but output is 5. That doesn't fit. So inconsistent.\n\nHmm. Let's think of another approach. Maybe the numbers are rotated in a certain way. For example, each digit is rotated on a numeric keypad or phone pad. Let's consider a phone keypad layout:\n\n1 2 3\n4 5 6\n7 8 9\n\nBut then, maybe moving each digit up, down, left, or right. Let's check example0:\n\n3 becomes 4. On the keypad, 3 is in the top right. Moving left would be 2, down to 6. But 3\u21924. So if moving right, but 3 is on the top row, so maybe moving down? 3 is in the first row, third column. Moving down would take it to 6 (third column, second row). But 3\u21924 here. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each digit is transformed by adding the sum of its digits (but they are single digits). So no change. Not helpful.\n\nAnother angle: perhaps each digit is replaced by 9 minus the digit. For example:\n\nIn example0: 3\u21926 (9-3=6?), but output is 4. So no.\n\nWait, 3\u21924: 3+1=4. 1\u21925:1+4=5. 2\u21926:2+4=6. So increments vary. 1, 4, 4. Not sure.\n\nLooking at example1: 2\u21926 (difference +4), 3\u21924 (difference +1), 8\u21929 (difference +1). So first element +4, others +1. \n\nExample2: 5\u21921 (difference -4), 8\u21929 (+1), 6\u21922 (-4). Hmm, first and third elements are -4, middle is +1.\n\nExample3: 9\u21928 (-1), 4\u21923 (-1), 2\u21926 (+4). Wait, here first two elements are -1, last is +4. Not a clear pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe looking at each digit's position in the row. For example, in example0, the input is [3,1,2]. Maybe each digit is replaced by the sum of all three digits minus that digit. So sum is 3+1+2=6. For first element: 6-3=3. But output is 4. Doesn't match. Maybe sum plus something. Not sure.\n\nWait, maybe each element is the sum of the other two. For example0:\n\n3 becomes 1+2=3 \u2192 output 4. No. 1 becomes 3+2=5. That matches. 2 becomes 3+1=4 \u2192 output 6. So first element sum of next two: 1+2=3 \u2192 output is 4. Doesn't fit. But second element 3+2=5, which matches. Third element 3+1=4, but output is 6. So only the middle one matches. So that's not the pattern.\n\nAnother thought: maybe each digit is replaced by the sum of its adjacent digits. But since it's a row, maybe left and right. For example, in the first element of the row, left neighbor is the third element (since it's a circular array?), but not sure. Let's test example0:\n\nInput [3,1,2]. For first element 3: left is 2, right is 1. Sum is 2+1=3 \u2192 output 4. Doesn't match. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each digit is multiplied by its position in the array (starting from 1). For example0:\n\n3 (position 1) \u2192 3*1=3 \u2192 output 4. 1*2=2 \u2192 output5. 2*3=6 \u2192 output6. So 3\u21923+1=4, 2\u21922+4=6? No. Or maybe 3*1 +1=4, 1*2 +3=5, 2*3 +0=6. Not consistent.\n\nWait, looking at example1's input [2,3,8] \u2192 output [6,4,9]. Let's compute 2*3=6 (matches first output). 3*1.333=4, 8*1.125=9. Not helpful.\n\nWait, example0's output is [4,5,6]. That's the next three numbers after 3,1,2. But how? 3+1=4, 1+4=5, 2+4=6. Maybe each number is increased by (position+1). Wait, position 0: 3 + (0+1) =4. Position 1:1 + (1+1)=3. Doesn't match. Or maybe added 1, then 4, then 4. Not consistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is each digit's position in the list when sorted. Let's see. For example0 input [3,1,2]. Sorted is [1,2,3]. So the original elements' indices in the sorted list would be 3 is index 2, 1 is 0, 2 is 1. Adding 1 (since indexes start at 0) gives 3,1,2. But output is [4,5,6]. Not matching.\n\nAnother approach: maybe the output is the sum of each digit's digits (but they are single digits) plus something. Not sure.\n\nLooking at all the transformations:\n\nExample0 Input: 3,1,2 \u2192 Output:4,5,6. Each increases by 1,4,4. Not a pattern.\n\nExample1: 2\u21926 (+4),3\u21924 (+1),8\u21929 (+1)\n\nExample2:5\u21921 (-4),8\u21929 (+1),6\u21922 (-4)\n\nExample3:9\u21928 (-1),4\u21923 (-1),2\u21926 (+4)\n\nHmm. It seems like for each input triplet, there's a pattern where the first and third elements are modified by \u00b14 or \u00b11, and the middle is \u00b11. Wait, let's look for a pattern in the differences:\n\nFor each example, let's note the differences between input and output elements:\n\nExample0:\n3\u21924: +1\n1\u21925: +4\n2\u21926: +4\n\nExample1:\n2\u21926: +4\n3\u21924: +1\n8\u21929: +1\n\nExample2:\n5\u21921: -4\n8\u21929: +1\n6\u21922: -4\n\nExample3:\n9\u21928: -1\n4\u21923: -1\n2\u21926: +4\n\nLooking at these differences, it's varying. But perhaps the sum of each row's input and the sum of the output can give a clue.\n\nExample0 input sum: 3+1+2=6. Output sum:4+5+6=15. 15-6=9.\n\nExample1 input sum:2+3+8=13. Output sum:6+4+9=19. Difference 6.\n\nExample2 input sum:5+8+6=19. Output sum:1+9+2=12. Difference -7.\n\nExample3 input sum:9+4+2=15. Output sum:8+3+6=17. Difference +2.\n\nNo obvious pattern here.\n\nAlternative approach: Maybe the output is derived by some operation related to the digits in the input array. For example, in example0, all input digits are 3,1,2. The output is 4,5,6. Maybe adding 1, 4, 4. But why?\n\nAlternatively, maybe each digit is mapped as follows:\n\n3\u21924 (3+1)\n1\u21925 (1+4)\n2\u21926 (2+4)\n\nThen in example1:\n\n2\u21926 (2+4)\n3\u21924 (3+1)\n8\u21929 (8+1)\n\nHmm, now that's interesting. For example0, the first element is +1, others +4 and +4. In example1, first element +4, others +1 and +1. Example2, first element -4, middle +1, third -4. Example3, first and second elements -1, third +4. \n\nThis seems inconsistent. But wait, maybe the first and third elements are being modified in the same way, and the middle element is different. Let's see:\n\nExample0: first +1, middle +4, third +4. No.\n\nExample1: first +4, middle +1, third +1.\n\nExample2: first -4, middle +1, third -4.\n\nExample3: first -1, middle -1, third +4.\n\nHmm. The middle element seems to be either +1, -1, +4, or other. But not a clear pattern. Maybe the middle element is being transformed by a certain rule, and the first and third by another.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the first and third elements are being swapped in some way. Let's check example0: input 3,1,2. Output 4,5,6. No swapping. Example1: 2,3,8 \u21926,4,9. 2 becomes 6, 3 becomes4, 8 becomes9. Not a swap. \n\nAnother thought: Maybe each digit is being replaced by the sum of the digits in the entire grid. But in example0, the input has 3 rows of [3,1,2], so sum is 3*3 + 1*3 + 2*3 = 18. But output is 4+5+6 repeated three times. Sum is 15*3=45. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each digit is replaced by the number of letters in its English name. Let's see:\n\n3 \u2192 three (5 letters) \u2192 output is 4. Doesn't match.\n\n1 \u2192 one (3) \u2192 output 5. No.\n\n2 \u2192 two (3) \u2192 output6. No.\n\nNot matching.\n\nAnother angle: Maybe the output is the digits in the input multiplied by their position plus something. For example0:\n\n3*1 +1=4, 1*2 +3=5, 2*3 +0=6. But why 3 added for the second element?\n\nNot sure. Let's look for a different pattern.\n\nWait, looking at example0's output [4,5,6]. The digits are consecutive. Example1's output [6,4,9] not. Example2's output [1,9,2] not. Example3's [8,3,6] also not. So consecutive digits only in example0.\n\nHmm. Let's try another approach. Let's list all input and output pairs and see if there's a substitution cipher.\n\nPossible substitutions:\n\n3 \u21924\n\n1 \u21925\n\n2 \u21926\n\nIn example0.\n\nIn example1:\n\n2\u21926, 3\u21924, 8\u21929.\n\nIn example2:\n\n5\u21921,8\u21929,6\u21922.\n\nIn example3:\n\n9\u21928,4\u21923,2\u21926.\n\nLooking for mappings:\n\n3: 4 (example0, example1)\n2:6 (example0, example3)\n8:9 (example1, example2)\n9:8 (example3)\n5:1 (example2)\n4:3 (example3)\n6:2 (example2), 6\u21926 (example0, but in example2 input6 becomes2)\n1:5 (example0)\n\nThis seems inconsistent. For example, 3 appears in example0 and example1, and in both cases maps to 4. So 3\u21924. But then, in example3, 4\u21923. So maybe a reciprocal mapping? Like 3\u21944, 4\u21943. Similarly, 2\u21926 and 6\u21922 in example2. So perhaps each pair is swapped. Let's list the mappings:\n\n3 \u21924\n\n4 \u21923\n\n2 \u21926\n\n6 \u21922\n\n8 \u21929\n\n9 \u21928\n\n5 \u21921\n\n1 \u21925?\n\nWait in example0, 1\u21925. Then in example3, 4\u21923, which is part of the swap. In example1, 8\u21929. Example2, 5\u21921. So yes:\n\nThe pattern seems to be swapping pairs of digits: (3\u21944), (2\u21946), (8\u21949), (5\u21941). Let's test this.\n\nExample0: input [3,1,2]. Applying swaps:\n\n3\u21924, 1\u21925, 2\u21926. So output [4,5,6]. Which matches.\n\nExample1: input [2,3,8]. 2\u21926, 3\u21924, 8\u21929. So [6,4,9]. Which matches.\n\nExample2: input [5,8,6]. 5\u21921, 8\u21929, 6\u21922. So [1,9,2]. Correct.\n\nExample3: input [9,4,2]. 9\u21928,4\u21923,2\u21926. So [8,3,6]. Correct.\n\nYes! So the pattern is that each digit is swapped with another digit according to specific pairs. The swap pairs are:\n\n1 \u21945\n\n2 \u21946\n\n3 \u21944\n\n8 \u21949\n\nDigits not in these pairs (like 7) would stay the same, but in the given examples, there are no such digits.\n\nSo for the test input [8,1,3], applying the swaps:\n\n8\u21929, 1\u21925,3\u21924. So the output would be [9,5,4], repeated three times.\n\nWait, but in the test input, the input is [8,1,3]. According to the swaps:\n\n8\u21929\n\n1\u21925\n\n3\u21924\n\nSo transformed to [9,5,4]. Then each row in the output is the same. So the output should be three rows of [9,5,4].\n\nBut let's check the examples again to confirm. Yes, each input digit is replaced by its swap pair. So the answer should be:\n\n[9,5,4]\n[9,5,4]\n[9,5,4]"
