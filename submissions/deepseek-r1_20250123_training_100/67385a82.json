        "cot_1": "Okay, let's tackle this puzzle. So, I need to figure out the pattern that transforms the input matrices into the output matrices in the training examples. Let me start by looking closely at each example and see if I can spot any similarities or rules.\n\nStarting with Example 0:\n\nInput:\n[3, 3, 0]\n[0, 3, 0]\n[3, 0, 3]\n\nOutput:\n[8, 8, 0]\n[0, 8, 0]\n[3, 0, 3]\n\nHmm. The first row has two 3s turned into 8s. The second row has a single 3 turned into 8. The third row's 3s remain 3. So maybe it's something about the position or neighboring elements. Let me check the next example.\n\nExample 1:\n\nInput:\n[0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3]\n[0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0]\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0]\n[0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nOutput:\n[0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 3]\n[0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0]\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0]\n[0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nHere, the 3 in the first row (second element) becomes 8, but the last 3 stays 3. In the second row, three 3s become 8s. The third row's 3 remains 3. The fourth row's 3 stays. So maybe the rule is that 3s are turned into 8s if they are adjacent to other 3s? Or maybe it's about being part of a contiguous block?\n\nWait, looking at Example 0 again: the first row has two 3s next to each other, both become 8. The second row's 3 is isolated (flanked by zeros?), so it becomes 8? But in the third row of Example 0, the 3s are at the ends and the middle is zero. So those 3s are not converted. So perhaps the condition is that a 3 is converted to 8 if it has a neighbor (left, right, up, down) that is also a 3. But let's check.\n\nIn Example 0's first row, the two 3s are adjacent, so they get converted. The third row's 3s are separated by zeros, so maybe they don't have adjacent 3s. But wait, in the third row of the input, the first element is 3, next is 0, then 3. So the 3s are not adjacent. So they remain as 3 in the output. That makes sense. So the rule could be: any 3 that has at least one adjacent 3 (horizontally or vertically) is replaced by 8. Otherwise, it remains 3.\n\nLet me check Example 1. In the first input row, the 3 is at position 1 (second element). The elements around it are 0 (left), 0 (right). So no adjacent 3s. But in the output, it's converted to 8. Wait, that contradicts the previous idea. Because in Example 1's first row, the 3 is at index 1. Let's see the input row: [0,3,0,0,0,3]. The 3 at index 1 is next to 0 and 0. The 3 at index 5 is next to 0. So according to the previous rule, they should not be converted. But in the output, the 3 at index 1 becomes 8, but the one at index 5 remains 3. So maybe the rule is different.\n\nWait, maybe the direction is only horizontal? Let's see. In Example 0's third row, the 3s are separated by a 0, so not adjacent. So they remain. But in the first row, adjacent 3s are converted. So perhaps the rule is that a 3 is converted to 8 if it has a horizontal neighbor (left or right) that's 3. Let's test this.\n\nExample 0, first row: 3,3,0. Both 3s have a right or left neighbor. So converted to 8. Second row: 0,3,0. The 3 has no horizontal neighbors (left is 0, right is 0). So according to this rule, it would not be converted. But in the output, it is converted to 8. So that can't be right. So maybe vertical neighbors are considered as well.\n\nWait, in Example 0's second row, the 3 is in the middle. The row is [0,3,0]. The 3 here is in row 1 (assuming rows start at 0). The row above is [3,3,0], so the 3 in row 1, column 1 (middle) is below a 3 in row 0, column 1. So that's a vertical neighbor. So maybe if a 3 has any adjacent (horizontal or vertical) 3, it's converted to 8. Let's test that.\n\nIn Example 0's third row: [3,0,3]. Each 3 has a 0 next to them horizontally, but what about vertically? Let's see. The first element of the third row (3) is in row 2, column 0. The row above (row 1) at column 0 is 0. So no vertical neighbor. The third element (3) in row 2, column 2. The row above (row 1) column 2 is 0. So no vertical neighbors. Hence, no adjacent 3s. So they remain as 3. So that fits.\n\nIn Example 1's first input row: [0,3,0,0,0,3]. The 3 at index 1 has vertical neighbors. Let's check the rows. The input rows are:\n\nRow 0: [0,3,0,0,0,3]\n\nRow 1: [0,3,3,3,0,0]\n\nRow 2: [0,0,0,0,3,0]\n\nRow 3: [0,3,0,0,0,0]\n\nLooking at the 3 in row 0, column 1. The row below (row 1) has a 3 in column 1. So vertically adjacent. So according to the rule, this 3 would be converted to 8, which matches the output. The 3 in row 0, column 5 (last element) is in a row where row 0, column 5. The row below (row 1) column 5 is 0. No vertical neighbor. So it's not converted, remains 3. Which matches the output.\n\nIn Example 1's second row (input row 1): [0,3,3,3,0,0]. All three 3s are adjacent horizontally and vertically. So they are converted to 8s. The output matches.\n\nIn row 3 of Example 1's input: [0,3,0,0,0,0]. The 3 is in row 3, column 1. Let's check adjacent cells. The row above (row 2) has 0 in column 1. The row below is row 3 (last row?), but maybe there is no row below. So no vertical neighbors. The left is 0, right is 0. So no adjacent 3s. But in the output, this 3 remains as 3, but wait in the output, it's converted to 8 in row 3? Wait, the output for Example 1 is:\n\n[0,8,0,0,0,3]\n\n[0,8,8,8,0,0]\n\n[0,0,0,0,3,0]\n\n[0,3,0,0,0,0]\n\nSo the input's row 3 (last row) in Example 1 is [0,3,0,0,0,0]. The output's row 3 is [0,3,0,0,0,0]. So the 3 here remains as 3. According to the rule, this 3 has no adjacent 3s. So correct.\n\nWait, but in Example 2's input:\n\n[3,3,0,3]\n\n[3,3,0,0]\n\n[3,0,0,3]\n\n[0,0,3,3]\n\nThe output is:\n\n[8,8,0,3]\n\n[8,8,0,0]\n\n[8,0,0,8]\n\n[0,0,8,8]\n\nLooking at the first row: 3,3,0,3. The first two 3s are adjacent horizontally, so converted to 8. The last 3 is in column 3. What's adjacent to it? The left is 0. The row below (row 1) has 0 in column 3. So no adjacent 3s. So it remains 3. Hence in output, the last element is 3. That fits.\n\nThird row of input Example 2: [3,0,0,3]. The first 3 (row 2, column 0) has a 3 above it (row 1, column 0) which is 3. So vertical neighbor, so converted to 8. The last element (3 in row 2, column 3) has a 3 below it (row 3, column 3) and perhaps the one in row 3, column 2? Wait, row 3 is [0,0,3,3]. So column 2 is 3. So the 3 in row 2, column 3 is adjacent to row 3, column 3 (same column, below), which is 3. So vertical neighbor. So converted to 8. Hence output becomes 8,0,0,8.\n\nFourth row of input Example 2: [0,0,3,3]. Both 3s are adjacent horizontally, so converted to 8. So output is [0,0,8,8]. Correct.\n\nSo the pattern seems to be: For each cell in the matrix, if the cell contains a 3 and has at least one adjacent (horizontal or vertical) cell that also contains a 3, then replace it with 8. Otherwise, leave it as 3.\n\nLet's verify this with Example 3.\n\nInput of Example 3:\n\n[3,3,0,0,0,0]\n\n[0,3,0,0,3,0]\n\n[3,0,0,0,0,0]\n\n[0,3,3,0,0,0]\n\n[0,3,3,0,0,3]\n\nOutput:\n\n[8,8,0,0,0,0]\n\n[0,8,0,0,3,0]\n\n[3,0,0,0,0,0]\n\n[0,8,8,0,0,0]\n\n[0,8,8,0,0,3]\n\nIn the first row, the two 3s are adjacent, so converted to 8.\n\nSecond row: The 3 at column 1 is adjacent to the 3 above (row 0, column 1) and possibly the one at column 4 (but that's in column 4). Let's check. The input row 1 is [0,3,0,0,3,0]. The 3 at column 1 has no horizontal neighbors. The cell above is row 0, column 1, which is 3. So vertical neighbor, hence converted to 8. The 3 at column 4 has no adjacent 3s. The row above (row 0) column 4 is 0. The row below (row 2) column 4 is 0. So no adjacent 3s. So remains 3. Which matches the output.\n\nThird row: [3,0,0,0,0,0]. The 3 is in column 0. Check if it has any adjacent 3s. The row above (row 2's input is [3,0,0,0,0,0]? Wait, input rows for Example 3 are:\n\nRow 0: [3,3,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow 1: [0,3,0,0,3,0]\n\nRow 2: [3,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow 3: [0,3,3,0,0,0]\n\nRow 4: [0,3,3,0,0,3]\n\nWait, the third row (row 2) is [3,0,0,0,0,0]. The 3 here is at column 0. The row above (row 1) column 0 is 0. The row below (row 3) column 0 is 0. So no vertical neighbors. To the right is 0. So no adjacent 3s. Hence, it remains 3 in the output.\n\nFourth row: [0,3,3,0,0,0]. The two 3s are adjacent, so converted to 8.\n\nFifth row: [0,3,3,0,0,3]. The first two 3s are adjacent, converted to 8. The last 3 (column 5) has no adjacent 3s. The row above (row 4's input?) Wait, row 4 is the fifth row here. The 3 in column 5 has left neighbor 0, right none. The row above (row 3) column 5 is 0. So no adjacent, hence remains 3.\n\nAll these cases fit the rule. So the pattern is: replace 3 with 8 if it has at least one adjacent (horizontal or vertical) 3; else, leave as 3.\n\nNow, applying this to the test input.\n\nTest Input:\n\nRow 0: [3, 0, 3, 0, 3]\n\nRow 1: [3, 3, 3, 0, 0]\n\nRow 2: [0, 0, 0, 0, 3]\n\nRow 3: [0, 3, 3, 0, 0]\n\nRow 4: [0, 3, 3, 0, 0]\n\nLet's process each cell.\n\nRow 0:\n\nElements: 3, 0, 3, 0, 3.\n\nCheck each 3:\n\n- First 3 (position 0): Check adjacent. To the right is 0. Below is row 1, position 0 (3). So vertical neighbor. So convert to 8.\n\n- Third element (3 at position 2): Left is 0, right is 0. Below is row 1, position 2 (3). Vertical neighbor. Convert to 8.\n\n- Last element (3 at position 4): Left is 0. Below is row 1, position 4 (0). So no vertical neighbors. Check next rows. Row 2, position 4 is 3. So vertical neighbor. So this 3 has a neighbor below (row 2, position 4 is 3). So convert to 8.\n\nWait, wait. The 3 in row 0, position 4 (last element of row 0). The cell below it is row 1, position 4, which is 0. Then row 2, position 4 is 3. Wait, row 0 is the first row. So row 0's position 4 is in column 4. The cell below in row 1, column 4 is 0 (from row 1's input: [3,3,3,0,0]). So row 1, column 4 is 0. Then row 2's column 4 is 3. So the vertical neighbor for row 0, column 4 is only row 1, column 4 (0). So the 3 in row 0, column 4 has a vertical neighbor two rows below? No, adjacent is only immediate up or down. So for any cell, check up, down, left, right (immediate neighbors). So row 0, column 4's adjacent cells are:\n\nLeft: 0 (row 0, column 3)\n\nRight: none (end of row)\n\nUp: none (since it's the first row)\n\nDown: row 1, column 4: 0.\n\nSo no adjacent 3s. Wait, but the 3 in row 0, column 4 has a vertical neighbor in row 2? No, adjacent is only immediate. So the 3 in row 0, column 4 is not adjacent to any 3. So according to the rule, it should remain 3. But wait, the 3 in row 0, column 4: in the output, would it be converted?\n\nWait, let me recheck.\n\nAdjacency is only immediate neighbors. So for any cell (i,j), check cells (i\u00b11, j) and (i, j\u00b11). So the 3 at (0,4) has down (1,4) which is 0. Left (0,3) is 0. So no adjacent 3s. Therefore, this 3 remains as 3 in the output. But in row 2, column 4 is 3. But that's two rows down, not adjacent. So the 3 at (0,4) remains 3. So row 0's output should be [8,0,8,0,3].\n\nWait, but let's check each 3 in row 0:\n\nFirst element (3 at (0,0)):\n\nUp: none.\n\nDown: (1,0) is 3.\n\nLeft: none.\n\nRight: (0,1) is 0.\n\nSo adjacent down is 3. So convert to 8.\n\nThird element (3 at (0,2)):\n\nLeft: 0.\n\nRight:0.\n\nUp: none.\n\nDown: (1,2) is 3. So convert to 8.\n\nFifth element (3 at (0,4)):\n\nNo adjacent 3s. So remains 3.\n\nSo row 0 becomes [8,0,8,0,3].\n\nRow 1: [3,3,3,0,0].\n\nCheck each 3:\n\nFirst element (3 at (1,0)):\n\nUp: (0,0) is 3.\n\nDown: (2,0) is 0.\n\nLeft: none.\n\nRight: (1,1) is 3.\n\nSo has adjacent 3s. Convert to 8.\n\nSecond element (3 at (1,1)):\n\nUp: (0,1) is 0.\n\nDown: (2,1) is 0.\n\nLeft: 3.\n\nRight:3.\n\nConvert to 8.\n\nThird element (3 at (1,2)):\n\nUp: (0,2) is 3.\n\nLeft:3.\n\nRight:0.\n\nDown: (2,2) is 0.\n\nConvert to 8.\n\nSo row 1 becomes [8,8,8,0,0].\n\nRow 2: [0,0,0,0,3].\n\nCheck the 3 at (2,4):\n\nUp: (1,4) is 0.\n\nDown: (3,4) is 0.\n\nLeft: 0.\n\nRight: none.\n\nSo no adjacent 3s. But wait, row 2 is [0,0,0,0,3]. So (2,4) is the 3. The only adjacent cells are (1,4) which is 0, (3,4) which is 0, (2,3) which is 0, and (2,5) which doesn't exist. So no adjacent 3s. So this 3 remains 3.\n\nBut wait, let's check row 3 and row 4 for any adjacent to (2,4). For example, row 3, column 4 is 0. Row 4, column 4 is 0. So no. So the 3 at (2,4) remains 3.\n\nSo row 2's output is [0,0,0,0,3].\n\nRow 3: [0,3,3,0,0].\n\nCheck each 3:\n\nAt (3,1):\n\nUp: row 2, column 1 is 0.\n\nDown: row 4, column 1 is 3.\n\nLeft: 0.\n\nRight:3.\n\nSo the 3 at (3,1) has a right neighbor (3) and a down neighbor (3). So convert to 8.\n\nAt (3,2):\n\nLeft:3 (3,1).\n\nUp: row 2, column 2 is 0.\n\nDown: row 4, column 2 is 3.\n\nRight:0.\n\nSo adjacent to 3 (left and down). Convert to 8.\n\nSo row 3 becomes [0,8,8,0,0].\n\nRow 4: [0,3,3,0,0].\n\nCheck each 3:\n\nAt (4,1):\n\nUp: row 3, column 1 is 3.\n\nLeft:0.\n\nRight:3.\n\nDown: none.\n\nSo adjacent to up and right. Convert to 8.\n\nAt (4,2):\n\nLeft:3 (4,1).\n\nUp: row 3, column 2 is 3.\n\nRight:0.\n\nDown: none.\n\nSo adjacent to left and up. Convert to 8.\n\nSo row 4 becomes [0,8,8,0,0].\n\nPutting all together, the output matrix should be:\n\n[8,0,8,0,3]\n\n[8,8,8,0,0]\n\n[0,0,0,0,3]\n\n[0,8,8,0,0]\n\n[0,8,8,0,0]\n\nWait, but looking back at the test input:\n\nTest Input:\nRow 0: [3,0,3,0,3]\n\nRow 1: [3,3,3,0,0]\n\nRow 2: [0,0,0,0,3]\n\nRow 3: [0,3,3,0,0]\n\nRow 4: [0,3,3,0,0]\n\nProcessing each row as per the rule.\n\nRow 0:\n\n3: Check adjacent. Down is row 1, first element 3. So convert to 8.\n\n0: stays 0.\n\n3: Down is row 1, third element 3. Convert to 8.\n\n0: stays 0.\n\n3: Check adjacent. Down is row 1, fifth element 0. Left is 0. So no adjacent 3s. So remains 3.\n\nSo row 0: [8,0,8,0,3]\n\nRow 1:\n\n3s in all first three elements. Each has adjacent 3s. Convert all to 8. Last two are 0. So [8,8,8,0,0].\n\nRow 2:\n\nOnly 3 at end. Check adjacent: up is 0 (row 1, fourth element), down is row 3, fifth element 0. Left is 0. So no adjacent 3s. Remains 3.\n\nRow 3:\n\n3s in positions 1 and 2. Each has adjacent 3s (each other and down to row4's 3s). So convert to 8.\n\nRow 4:\n\n3s in positions 1 and 2. Each adjacent to each other and up to row3's 3s. Convert to 8.\n\nSo the output rows should be:\n\n[8, 0, 8, 0, 3]\n\n[8, 8, 8, 0, 0]\n\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 3]\n\n[0, 8, 8, 0, 0]\n\n[0, 8, 8, 0, 0]\n\nYes, that seems correct.",

        "cot_2": "Okay, let's tackle this puzzle. So, I need to figure out the pattern from the training examples and apply it to the test input. Let me start by looking closely at each example to see what's changing from input to output.\n\nStarting with Example 0:\n\nInput:\n[3, 3, 0]\n[0, 3, 0]\n[3, 0, 3]\n\nOutput:\n[8, 8, 0]\n[0, 8, 0]\n[3, 0, 3]\n\nHmm, so some 3s are being replaced with 8s. But not all of them. Let's look at the positions. In the first row, the first two 3s become 8s. The third is 0. The second row has a 3 in the middle, which becomes 8. The third row's first and third elements are 3, but they stay as 3. So why are some changed and others not?\n\nMaybe it's about adjacency. Let's check. If a 3 is adjacent (like up, down, left, right) to another 3, then it becomes 8? Wait, in the first row of Example 0, the first two 3s are next to each other. The middle 3 in the second row is next to the ones above and maybe others. But the third row's 3s are next to 0s. Wait, but in the third row of the input, the first element is 3, next to 0 and 3 (from the row above). The third element is 3, next to 0 and the 3 below? Not sure yet.\n\nWait, maybe it's about the number of adjacent 3s. Or maybe the 3s that are part of a contiguous block (like connected) get turned into 8s. Let's see another example.\n\nExample 1:\n\nInput:\n[0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3]\n[0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0]\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0]\n[0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nOutput:\n[0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 3]\n[0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0]\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0]\n[0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nHere, in the first row, the second element is 3, becomes 8, but the last element is 3 and stays. The second row has three 3s in a row, all turned to 8. The third row's 3 becomes 3. The fourth row's 3 stays as 3. So maybe the 3s that are part of a group (like connected horizontally or vertically) get changed to 8, and isolated 3s (those not adjacent to others) stay as 3? Let's check.\n\nIn Example 0's third row, the first 3 is adjacent to the 3 above it (from the first row's third element, which is 0 though). Wait, maybe I'm getting the rows mixed up. Let me visualize:\n\nExample 0 Input:\n\nRow 0: 3,3,0\nRow 1:0,3,0\nRow 2:3,0,3\n\nIn the output, row 0 and 1 have 8s where there were 3s except for row 2's 3s. The 3s in row 2 are at positions 0 and 2. Let's check their adjacency. The first 3 in row 2 (position 0) is below row 0's 3 (position 0). So maybe if a 3 is adjacent (including vertically) to another 3, it becomes 8. But in row 2 of input, the 3s are next to 0s. Wait, maybe not. Wait the first 3 in row 2 is adjacent (down) to row 0's first 3? No, row 0 is above row 1, which is above row 2. So row 2's first element is adjacent (up) to row 1's first element, which is 0. So that 3 is not adjacent to any other 3. Similarly, the last element in row 2 is adjacent to row 1's last element, which is 0. So those 3s are isolated. So maybe the rule is: any 3 that is part of a connected region (where connected means adjacent horizontally or vertically) of two or more 3s gets replaced by 8, and isolated 3s remain as 3.\n\nLooking at Example 0's input. The first two rows have 3s that are connected. For example, row 0's first two 3s are adjacent. Then the middle 3 in row 1 is adjacent to the 3 above (row 0's middle). So those form a connected group. But the third row's 3s are isolated. So they remain as 3.\n\nIn Example 1's input, the second row has three 3s connected, all become 8. The first row's 3 is connected to the row below's 3s? Wait, row 0's second element is 3. Row 1's second element is 3, which is adjacent below. So that 3 in row 0 is connected to the group in row 1. So that 3 becomes 8. The last element in row 0 is 3, but in row 1's last element is 0, so that 3 is isolated. So it remains 3. Similarly, the 3 in row 3 (fourth row) is isolated, so it remains 3.\n\nIn Example 2's input:\n\nInput:\n[3,3,0,3]\n[3,3,0,0]\n[3,0,0,3]\n[0,0,3,3]\n\nOutput:\n[8,8,0,3]\n[8,8,0,0]\n[8,0,0,8]\n[0,0,8,8]\n\nLooking at the first row: the first two 3s become 8s. The last 3 in the first row is 3 but in output it remains 3. But why? Wait, perhaps the first row's last 3 (position 3) is adjacent to the row below's position 3, which is 0. So it's isolated. So it's a single 3. But the fourth row's last two 3s are adjacent, so they become 8. Wait, the fourth row's input is [0,0,3,3], so the two 3s are adjacent, so they become 8. The third row's last 3 (position 3) is adjacent to the fourth row's position 3, which is 3. So that 3 in row 3 (third row) is part of a connected group. So in output, it becomes 8. Similarly, the first row's last 3 is isolated, so stays 3.\n\nSo the pattern seems to be: replace all 3s that are part of a connected group (with adjacent 3s) to 8. Isolated 3s (not adjacent to any other 3s) remain 3.\n\nSo the transformation is: for each cell, if the cell is 3 and it has at least one adjacent (horizontally or vertically) 3, then change it to 8. Otherwise, leave it as 3 or 0 if it's 0.\n\nLet's test this against the examples.\n\nExample 0: In the first row, the two 3s are adjacent. So they become 8. The middle row's 3 is adjacent to the ones above and possibly others. The third row's 3s are not adjacent to any others, so remain 3. That matches.\n\nExample 1: The 3 in the first row's second position is adjacent to the 3 in the second row's second position. So it becomes 8. The last 3 in the first row is isolated. The second row's 3s form a group. The fourth row's 3 is isolated. So output matches.\n\nExample 2: The first row's first two 3s are connected. The last 3 is isolated. The third row's first 3 is connected to the ones above. The last 3 in the third row is connected to the fourth row's 3s. So all those become 8. The fourth row's 3s are connected. So output is correct.\n\nSo the rule seems solid. Now, applying this to the test input:\n\nTest Input:\nRow 0: [3,0,3,0,3]\nRow 1: [3,3,3,0,0]\nRow 2: [0,0,0,0,3]\nRow 3: [0,3,3,0,0]\nRow 4: [0,3,3,0,0]\n\nLet's process each cell.\n\nRow 0:\nElements at positions 0,2,4 are 3. Check their adjacency.\n\nPosition 0: 3. Check neighbors. Left: none. Right: 0. Up: none (since it's top row). Down: row 1's position 0 is 3. So adjacent to 3. So becomes 8.\n\nPosition 2: 3. Left is 0, right is 0. Up: row 1's position 2 is 3. So adjacent. So becomes 8.\n\nPosition 4: 3. Left is 0. Right: none. Up: row 1's position 4 is 0. Down: row 2's position 4 is 3. So adjacent. So becomes 8.\n\nSo row 0 becomes [8,0,8,0,8].\n\nWait, but the test input's row 0 is [3,0,3,0,3]. Let me check again.\n\nRow 0: 3 (pos0) is adjacent to row1's pos0 (3), so yes. So becomes 8.\n\npos2: 3. Check up (row1's pos2 is 3), so adjacent. So 8.\n\npos4: 3. Down is row1's pos4? Wait no, row1 is [3,3,3,0,0]. So row1's pos4 is 0. So row0's pos4's down is row1's pos4 (0). Then, check down for row0's pos4: row1's pos4 is 0. So adjacent? Only row1. But row2's pos4 is 3. Wait, row0's pos4 is in the top row. Down is row1. So for pos4 in row0, the only down neighbor is row1's pos4 (0). Then, in row2, which is two rows down, but adjacency is only immediate up, down, left, right. So row0's pos4 has down neighbor in row1's pos4 (0). So no adjacent 3s. So row0's pos4 is 3, but no adjacent 3s. So it remains 3. Wait, this contradicts my earlier thought.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake here. Let's re-express the test input:\n\nRow 0: 3,0,3,0,3\n\nRow 1:3,3,3,0,0\n\nRow 2:0,0,0,0,3\n\nRow 3:0,3,3,0,0\n\nRow4:0,3,3,0,0\n\nSo for row0's pos4 (the last element in row0), check adjacent cells:\n\nLeft: 0 (pos3)\n\nRight: none (since it's end of row)\n\nUp: none (it's top row)\n\nDown: row1's pos4 is 0.\n\nSo the 3 at row0 pos4 has no adjacent 3s. So it should stay as 3. But in the output, would that be the case?\n\nWait, but in the test input, row0's pos4 is 3. Let's see: does it have any adjacent 3s? The only adjacent cells are left (0) and down (row1's pos4, which is 0). So no adjacent 3s. So that 3 remains 3.\n\nSimilarly, row0's pos0: 3. Down is row1's pos0 (3). So adjacent. So becomes 8.\n\nRow0's pos2: 3. Down is row1's pos2 (3). So becomes 8.\n\nRow0's pos4: 3. No adjacent 3s. Stays 3.\n\nSo row0's output would be [8,0,8,0,3].\n\nWait but let's check other parts.\n\nRow1: [3,3,3,0,0]\n\nAll three 3s are adjacent. So they all become 8.\n\nSo row1 becomes [8,8,8,0,0].\n\nRow2: [0,0,0,0,3]. The last element is 3. Check adjacent cells: up is row1's pos4 (0), left is 0, down is row3's pos4 (0). So isolated. So remains 3.\n\nRow3: [0,3,3,0,0]. The 3s in positions1 and 2 are adjacent. So become 8. So row3 becomes [0,8,8,0,0].\n\nRow4: same as row3, so becomes [0,8,8,0,0].\n\nSo putting it all together, the output would be:\n\n[8, 0, 8, 0, 3]\n[8, 8, 8, 0, 0]\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 3]\n[0, 8, 8, 0, 0]\n[0, 8, 8, 0, 0]\n\nBut wait, looking at the training examples, like Example 3, which had some rows that weren't modified. For instance, in Example 3's third row, the input was [3,0,0,0,0,0] and output remained [3,0,0,0,0,0]. Because that 3 is isolated.\n\nBut in our test case's row0, the 3 in position4 is isolated, so remains 3. So the output would have that.\n\nBut let me check once again. Let's go cell by cell.\n\nRow0:\n\n0: 3. Adjacent cells: down (row1,0=3). So 8.\n\n1:0. Stays 0.\n\n2:3. Adjacent: down (row1,2=3). 8.\n\n3:0. Stays.\n\n4:3. Adjacent: down (row1,4=0). Left (0). So no. Stays 3.\n\nRow0 output: [8,0,8,0,3]\n\nRow1:\n\n0:3. Adjacent to row0,0 (3) and row1,1 (3). So 8.\n\n1:3. Adjacent to left (3), right (3), and row0,1 (0). 8.\n\n2:3. Adjacent to left (3), right (0), and row0,2 (3). 8.\n\n3:0. Stays.\n\n4:0. Stays.\n\nRow1: [8,8,8,0,0]\n\nRow2:\n\n0:0. Stays.\n\n1:0. Stays.\n\n2:0. Stays.\n\n3:0. Stays.\n\n4:3. Check adjacent: up (row1,4=0), down (row3,4=0), left (0). So isolated. Stays 3.\n\nRow2 output: [0,0,0,0,3]\n\nRow3:\n\n0:0.\n\n1:3. Adjacent to row3,2 (3) and row4,1 (3). So 8.\n\n2:3. Adjacent to row3,1 (3) and row4,2 (3). 8.\n\nOthers 0. So [0,8,8,0,0]\n\nRow4: same as row3. So [0,8,8,0,0]\n\nPutting it all together:\n\n[8, 0, 8, 0, 3]\n\n[8, 8, 8, 0, 0]\n\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 3]\n\n[0, 8, 8, 0, 0]\n\n[0, 8, 8, 0, 0]\n\nBut let me check the training examples' format. For instance, in Example 0, the output's third row was [3,0,3], same as input. So the 3s that are isolated remain. So yes.\n\nSo the test input's output should be as above."
