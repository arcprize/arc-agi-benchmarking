        "cot_1": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. So, looking at the training examples, each input is a list of three lists (arrays), and the output is a list of six lists. Let me go through each example step by step.\n\nStarting with Example 0:\nInput:\n[9,1,4]\n[9,1,4]\n[2,1,1]\n\nOutput:\nThe same three input rows are followed by three more rows. The first three are the same as input. The fourth row is [2,1,1], which is the third input row. Then the fifth and sixth are [9,1,4] and [9,1,4], which are the first two input rows again. Wait, but in reverse order? Wait, no, the first two input rows are the same. So after the third row, they repeat the third row again, then go back to the first two rows. Hmm.\n\nExample 1:\nInput:\n[4,8,4]\n[7,6,7]\n[8,7,8]\n\nOutput:\nThe output starts with the three input rows. Then the fourth row is [8,7,8], same as third input. Then fifth is [7,6,7], second input. Sixth is [4,8,4], first input. Oh, so after the original three rows, they mirror the rows in reverse order. Like the output is the input followed by the reverse of the input. Wait, but the output's fourth row is third input, fifth is second, sixth is first. So the output is input rows + reversed input rows. But wait, the original input has three rows. So adding the reversed three rows would make total six. So in Example 0, the output is original three rows plus the same three rows again but in reverse order? Wait, in Example 0, the input rows are row1, row1, row3. Then the output is row1, row1, row3, then row3, row1, row1. Wait, that's not exactly the reverse. Because the reversed input would be row3, row1, row1. But the original input is row1, row1, row3. So the reversed would be row3, row1, row1. So the output is input followed by reversed input. Let's check:\n\nExample 0 input is three rows: A, A, B. Output is A, A, B, B, A, A. So after the original three, it's B, A, A. Which is the reverse of the input's rows. Because the input is [A, A, B], reversed is [B, A, A]. So the output is input concatenated with reversed input. That seems to fit.\n\nLooking at Example 1:\n\nInput rows are C, D, E. Output is C, D, E, E, D, C. So reversed input is E, D, C. So output is original + reversed. Yes.\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput is F, G, H. Output is F, G, H, H, G, F. So again, original + reversed.\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput is I, I, J. Output is I, I, J, J, I, I. Which is input followed by reversed input. Because input is [I, I, J], reversed is [J, I, I], so output is I, I, J followed by J, I, I. Wait, but the output here is [I, I, J], [J, I, I], [I, I, J], [I, I, J]. Wait, no, the output for Example3 is:\n\nInput rows:\n\n[2,6,9]\n\n[2,6,9]\n\n[2,9,2]\n\nOutput:\n\nFirst three same as input. Then [2,9,2], [2,6,9], [2,6,9]. So reversed input is the third row, second, first? Wait, the original input is three rows: row1, row1, row3. Reversed would be row3, row1, row1. So the output after the initial three is row3, row1, row1. Which matches the example: the output's fourth row is row3 (third input row), then fifth is row1, sixth is row1. So yes, the pattern is input followed by reversed input.\n\nSo the pattern seems to be: take the input's three rows, then append the reverse of those three rows. So for the output, it's the original list of rows followed by the reverse of that list.\n\nSo for the test input:\n\nTest Input:\n\n[2,9,2]\n\n[8,5,2]\n\n[2,2,8]\n\nThe original three rows are:\n\nRow1: [2,9,2]\n\nRow2: [8,5,2]\n\nRow3: [2,2,8]\n\nReversed list of rows would be Row3, Row2, Row1.\n\nSo the output should be:\n\nOriginal rows:\n\n[2,9,2]\n\n[8,5,2]\n\n[2,2,8]\n\nThen reversed rows:\n\n[2,2,8] (Row3),\n\n[8,5,2] (Row2),\n\n[2,9,2] (Row1)\n\nSo the output is the original three rows followed by the reversed three rows.\n\nTherefore, the test output would be:\n\n[2,9,2]\n\n[8,5,2]\n\n[2,2,8]\n\n[2,2,8]\n\n[8,5,2]\n\n[2,9,2]\n\nWhich matches the pattern seen in the training examples.",

        "cot_2": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. So, looking at the training examples, each input is a list of lists (or rows), and the output is a longer list of lists. Let's see what's happening step by step.\n\nStarting with Example 0:\n\nInput has three rows:\n[9,1,4]\n[9,1,4]\n[2,1,1]\n\nOutput has six rows:\nSame three rows, then the third row again, then the second, then the first. Wait, no. Let me check:\n\nOriginal input rows are three. The output has the original three, then the third row again, then the second, then the first. Wait, in Example 0's output:\n\nOriginal rows (3) are followed by [2,1,1] again (so that's row 3), then [9,1,4] (row 2?), but wait the original input's rows are [9,1,4], [9,1,4], [2,1,1]. So rows 0,1,2. The output is the original three rows, then the third row (row 2?), then the second row (row 1?), then the first row (row 0?) again. Wait, no. Let's list them:\n\nOriginal input rows:\n\nRow 0: [9,1,4]\n\nRow 1: [9,1,4]\n\nRow 2: [2,1,1]\n\nOutput:\n\n[9,1,4] (row0)\n\n[9,1,4] (row1)\n\n[2,1,1] (row2)\n\nThen [2,1,1] (row2 again)\n\nThen [9,1,4] (row1 again)\n\nThen [9,1,4] (row0 again?)\n\nWait, that's row0? Because the original rows are [9,1,4] twice. So maybe after the initial three rows, the output appends the third row again, then the second, then the first? But in Example0, after the third row, the next is [2,1,1] (same as third), then the next is [9,1,4] (which is the second row), then another [9,1,4] (the first row). Wait, but the first and second rows are the same. So maybe the pattern is that after the original three rows, we mirror them in reverse order. Like the output is original rows + reversed rows. But the reversed rows would be [row2, row1, row0]. But in Example0's output, after the original 3 rows, it adds row2 again, then row1, then row0. So the total becomes 3 + 3 = 6 rows. So the output is original rows followed by reversed original rows. But in Example0, the original rows are [row0, row1, row2], then reversed would be [row2, row1, row0], which when added gives the output. Let's check:\n\nOriginal input for Example0:\n\nRow0: [9,1,4]\n\nRow1: [9,1,4]\n\nRow2: [2,1,1]\n\nReversed list of rows would be [row2, row1, row0] \u2192 [[2,1,1], [9,1,4], [9,1,4]]\n\nSo the output would be original + reversed, which gives:\n\n[ [9,1,4], [9,1,4], [2,1,1], [2,1,1], [9,1,4], [9,1,4] ]\n\nWhich matches the output of Example0. So that seems to fit. Let's check Example1.\n\nInput for Example1:\n\nRows:\n\n[4,8,4]\n\n[7,6,7]\n\n[8,7,8]\n\nOriginal rows are row0, row1, row2. Then reversed would be row2, row1, row0. So output is original followed by reversed. So output should be:\n\nOriginal three rows:\n\n[4,8,4], [7,6,7], [8,7,8]\n\nThen reversed:\n\n[8,7,8], [7,6,7], [4,8,4]\n\nSo the output would be the original three plus reversed three, total six rows. Which matches the Example1 output.\n\nSame for Example2:\n\nInput rows:\n\n[7,7,7], [9,5,5], [5,1,7]\n\nReversed: [5,1,7], [9,5,5], [7,7,7]\n\nSo output is original three, then reversed three. Which matches the output given.\n\nExample3:\n\nInput:\n\n[2,6,9], [2,6,9], [2,9,2]\n\nReversed would be [2,9,2], [2,6,9], [2,6,9]\n\nSo output is original three plus reversed three. Which is exactly the output shown.\n\nSo the pattern is: take the input list of three rows, then append the reverse of those three rows. So the output is input + input[::-1] (if we think in Python terms).\n\nTherefore, for the test input:\n\nTest Input:\n\n[2,9,2]\n\n[8,5,2]\n\n[2,2,8]\n\nOriginal three rows. Then reversed order. So the reversed rows would be:\n\n[2,2,8], [8,5,2], [2,9,2]\n\nSo the output should be the original three rows followed by these three reversed rows.\n\nLet me check each step.\n\nOriginal input rows:\n\nRow0: [2,9,2]\n\nRow1: [8,5,2]\n\nRow2: [2,2,8]\n\nReversed list is [row2, row1, row0], which are:\n\n[2,2,8], [8,5,2], [2,9,2]\n\nSo the output will be:\n\nOriginal:\n\n[2,9,2]\n\n[8,5,2]\n\n[2,2,8]\n\nThen reversed:\n\n[2,2,8]\n\n[8,5,2]\n\n[2,9,2]\n\nSo combining these, the output is six rows as per the pattern. Let's write that out."
