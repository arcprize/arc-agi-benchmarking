        "cot_1": "Okay, let's tackle this puzzle. So, the task is to find the pattern in the training examples that maps the input matrices to their corresponding outputs, and then apply that pattern to the test input. The outputs are either [0] or [8]. Let me look through the examples to figure out the rule here.\n\nStarting with Example 0: The input is a 5x5 matrix. The output is [0]. Let me see if there's a particular arrangement of numbers that leads to this. All the examples have 0s, 8s, and 2s. Maybe it's about counting certain patterns or sequences. Let's check each example.\n\nIn Example 0, looking at the rows, some have sequences like [2,2] and [8,8]. Maybe it's about pairs? Like consecutive 2s or 8s. But how does that relate to the output?\n\nLooking at Example 1's input. The output is [8]. Maybe the output depends on which number (0, 8, or 2) is part of a certain structure. Or perhaps it's about the majority element in a specific position or arrangement.\n\nWait, maybe the output is determined by the presence of a \"closed\" loop or a particular shape. For example, in some puzzles, 8s might form loops, and the output is 8 if there's a loop, else 0. But how would that apply here?\n\nAlternatively, think of the grid as layers. Maybe the output is the number that forms a full perimeter or a ring around the center. Let me check the examples again.\n\nAnother idea: the output could be the value that is in a certain position after some transformation. For example, the center cell after some rotation or reflection. But the matrices vary in size (5x5, 7x5, etc.), so maybe that's not it.\n\nLooking at Example 5: The input is 6 rows. Output is [0]. Let's look at the rows. The last row is [0,8,8,0,8,0]. Maybe the pattern is about the corners? Like the sum of the four corners? Let's check Example 0's corners: first row's first and last elements are 0 and 8. Last row's first and last are 8 and 2. Hmm, not sure.\n\nWait, maybe the output is determined by the number of 2x2 squares of 8s or 2s. For example, in Example 0, maybe there are no such squares, leading to 0. But Example 1's output is 8, perhaps there's a 2x2 square of 8s. Let me check.\n\nIn Example 1's input, looking at the rows:\nSecond row: [2,2,0,8,8,8,0] \u2013 no 2x2 8s here. Third row: [2,2,8,8,0,2,2]. The 8s here are two consecutive, but then a 0. So maybe a 2x2 square of 8s exists elsewhere. Fourth row: [0,0,8,0,0,2,2]. Not seeing it. Maybe the 8s form a loop around the center. Alternatively, looking for islands.\n\nAlternatively, think of the matrix as representing a grid where 8s form regions. The output is 8 if there's an even number of regions, 0 otherwise? Not sure. Let me check the examples.\n\nExample 0's output is 0. How many 8 regions are there? Let's see:\n\nRow 0: 0,0,8,0,8 \u2013 two 8s not connected. Row1: 2,2,8,0,0 \u2013 one 8. Row2: 2,2,0,0,8 \u2013 another 8. Row3: 0,0,0,2,2. Row4: 8,8,0,2,2. So in row4, two 8s connected. So total regions: maybe 3 (the single 8s in row0 and row2, and the two in row4). 3 is odd, output 0. Example1's output is 8. Let's count regions. Maybe even number. But this is getting complicated. Let's see if there's a simpler pattern.\n\nAnother approach: look for the number that appears the most in certain positions. For instance, the corners. Let's check the first example.\n\nExample 1's input has 7 columns and 5 rows. The corners of the entire matrix would be first row's first and last elements (0 and 0), and last row's first and last (0 and 0). So corners are 0,0,0,0. But output is 8, so that's not it.\n\nWait, perhaps the output is the value that is in the center of the matrix. But matrices have different sizes. For example, a 5x5 matrix has a clear center (position (3,3)), but a 5x7 matrix would have different. Maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, check the sum of all elements. Let's calculate sum for each example:\n\nExample 0: Sum all rows:\n\nRow0: 0+0+8+0+8 =16\n\nRow1:2+2+8+0+0=12\n\nRow2:2+2+0+0+8=12\n\nRow3:0+0+0+2+2=4\n\nRow4:8+8+0+2+2=20\n\nTotal sum:16+12+12+4+20=64. 64 mod 10 is 4. Output is 0. Doesn't match.\n\nExample1's sum:\n\nRow0:0+8+0+0+0+0+0=8\n\nRow1:2+2+0+8+8+8+0=28\n\nRow2:2+2+8+8+0+2+2=24\n\nRow3:0+0+8+0+0+2+2=12\n\nRow4:0+8+0+0+8+0+0=16\n\nTotal sum:8+28=36+24=60+12=72+16=88. 88 mod 10 is 8. Output is 8. That matches. Oh! Maybe the output is the sum of all elements modulo 10. Let's check other examples.\n\nExample2's output is 8. Let's compute sum:\n\nRow0:8+2+2+8+8+0+0=28\n\nRow1:0+2+2+0+0+0+8=12\n\nRow2:0+8+8+0+0+8+0=24\n\nRow3:0+0+8+0+0+0+8=16\n\nRow4:8+0+8+8+8+2+2=36\n\nRow5:8+0+0+0+0+2+2=12\n\nSum:28+12=40+24=64+16=80+36=116+12=128. 128 mod 10 is 8. Output is 8. That matches.\n\nExample3: output 0.\n\nRow0:8+8+0+0+2+2+0=20\n\nRow1:0+8+8+0+2+2+8=28\n\nRow2:0+0+0+8+0+8+0=16\n\nRow3:8+0+0+0+0+0+0=8\n\nRow4:0+2+2+0+8+0+8=20\n\nRow5:0+2+2+8+8+0+8=28\n\nSum:20+28=48+16=64+8=72+20=92+28=120. 120 mod 10 is 0. Output is 0. Correct.\n\nExample4: output 8. Sum:\n\nRow0:8+0+0+0+0+8+0=16\n\nRow1:0+0+2+2+0+8+0=12\n\nRow2:8+0+2+2+0+0+0=12\n\nRow3:0+0+8+0+0+8+0=16\n\nRow4:0+0+8+2+2+0+8=20\n\nRow5:8+0+0+2+2+8+0=20\n\nSum:16+12=28+12=40+16=56+20=76+20=96. 96 mod 10 is 6. Output is 8. Wait, that's a problem. So this breaks the pattern. So maybe the sum modulo 10 isn't the rule. Hmm.\n\nWait, example4's sum is 96, which modulo 10 is 6, but the output is 8. So that's a contradiction. So the sum modulo 10 can't be the answer. So that idea is wrong.\n\nAlternative approach: Maybe the output is the number that appears the most in the borders of the matrix. Let's check.\n\nExample0: The borders are the first and last rows, and first and last columns. Let's collect those elements.\n\nFirst row: 0,0,8,0,8\n\nLast row:8,8,0,2,2\n\nFirst column: 0,2,2,0,8 \u2192 0,2,2,0,8\n\nLast column:8,0,8,2,2\n\nSo all border elements: 0,0,8,0,8, 8,8,0,2,2, 0,2,2,0,8,8,0,8,2,2. Count:\n\n0: let's count. How many 0s?\n\nFirst row: 0,0,8,0,8 \u2192 3 zeros.\n\nLast row: 8,8,0,2,2 \u2192 1 zero.\n\nFirst column: 0,2,2,0,8 \u2192 2 zeros.\n\nLast column:8,0,8,2,2 \u2192 1 zero.\n\nTotal zeros: 3+1+2+1 =7.\n\n8s: first row has two 8s. Last row has two 8s. First column: one 8. Last column: two 8s. Total 2+2+1+2=7.\n\n2s: first row none. Last row two 2s. First column two 2s. Last column two 2s. Total 0+2+2+2=6.\n\nSo 0 and 8 each have 7. So output is 0. Which matches. But the output is 0, which is the same as the sum modulo 10 being 0 in example0. But example4's sum mod10 was 6, but the output is 8. So maybe in cases of a tie, like in example0, the output is 0 (the first in order?), but perhaps the actual rule is different.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the number that appears the most along the perimeter. If there's a tie, perhaps the output is 0. Because in example0, 0 and 8 are tied. Output is 0.\n\nExample1's output is 8. Let's check perimeter elements.\n\nExample1's input is 5 rows, 7 columns.\n\nFirst row: [0,8,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nLast row: [0,8,0,0,8,0,0]\n\nFirst column: 0,2,2,0,0 \u2192 0,2,2,0,0.\n\nLast column:0,0,2,2,0 \u2192 0,0,2,2,0.\n\nSo perimeter elements include first row (all elements), last row (all), first column (excluding first and last elements as they are already counted in the rows), and last column (same). Wait, maybe the perimeter is the outermost elements. So for a matrix, the perimeter is the first and last rows, and the first and last columns. Let's collect all elements in the first row, last row, first column (excluding first and last element), and last column (excluding first and last element).\n\nWait, perhaps the perimeter is all elements in the first and last row, plus the first and last elements of the other rows. Let me see.\n\nFor example, in example0, which is 5x5:\n\nRows 0 and 4 (first and last) are fully included. Rows 1, 2, 3: take first and last element.\n\nSo perimeter elements would be:\n\nRow0: all 5 elements.\n\nRow4: all 5 elements.\n\nRows 1-3: elements 0 and 4 (since columns 0 and 4 are the first and last of the 5 columns).\n\nSo for example0:\n\nRow0: 0,0,8,0,8\n\nRow4:8,8,0,2,2\n\nRow1:2 (index0) and 0 (index4)\n\nRow2:2 and 8\n\nRow3:0 and 2\n\nSo perimeter elements: 0,0,8,0,8, 8,8,0,2,2, 2,0, 2,8, 0,2.\n\nCount 0s: Let's see:\n\nRow0 has four 0s? Wait, row0 is [0,0,8,0,8], so 0,0,8,0,8 \u2192 four 0s (indices 0,1,3).\n\nWait, no: 0,0,8,0,8 \u2192 0 appears at positions 0,1,3 \u2192 three 0s. Then row4:8,8,0,2,2 \u2192 one 0. Rows1-3:\n\nRow1:2 (index0) and 0 (index4) \u2192 0 appears once.\n\nRow2:2 (index0) and 8 (index4) \u2192 0 times.\n\nRow3:0 (index0) and 2 (index4) \u2192 one 0.\n\nSo total 0s:3 (row0) +1 (row4's 0) +1 (row1's 0) +1 (row3's 0) =6.\n\n8s in perimeter:\n\nRow0: 8 at index2 and 4 \u2192 two 8s.\n\nRow4:8,8 at index0 and 1 \u2192 two 8s, and the 0 at index2, and 2,2. So 8s in row4: two.\n\nRows1-3:\n\nRow1: 2 and 0 \u2192 no 8s.\n\nRow2:2 and 8 \u2192 one 8.\n\nRow3:0 and 2 \u2192 no 8s.\n\nTotal 8s: 2+2 +1 =5.\n\nSo 0s:6, 8s:5, 2s: let's see. 2s in row1's 2, row2's 2, row3's 0 and 2. Wait, perimeter elements: in row1, 2 (index0) and 0 (index4). So row1 contributes a 2. Row2's 2 (index0) and 8 (index4) \u2192 another 2. Row3's 0 and 2 (index4) \u2192 one 2. Also, row4's elements are 8,8,0,2,2 \u2192 two 2s. So 2s: row0 has none. Row4 has two. Rows1:1. Row2:1. Row3:1. Total 2s:1+1+1+2=5.\n\nSo in perimeter elements, 0s:6, 8s:5, 2s:5. So 0 is the most frequent. Output is [0], which matches.\n\nExample1's output is [8]. Let's check perimeter elements.\n\nInput matrix is 5 rows,7 columns. So perimeter is first and last rows, and first and last columns.\n\nFirst row: [0,8,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nLast row: [0,8,0,0,8,0,0]\n\nFirst column: rows 0-4, index0. So 0,2,2,0,0.\n\nLast column: rows 0-4, index6. So 0,0,2,2,0.\n\nSo perimeter elements:\n\nFirst row: all elements (7 elements: 0,8,0,0,0,0,0)\n\nLast row: all elements (0,8,0,0,8,0,0)\n\nFirst column (excluding row0 and row4's index0, which are already in first and last rows): rows1-3, index0: 2,2,0.\n\nLast column (excluding row0 and row4's index6): rows1-3, index6:0,2,2.\n\nSo total perimeter elements:\n\nFirst row: 7 elements.\n\nLast row:7 elements.\n\nFirst column (rows1-3, index0): 2,2,0 \u2192 three elements.\n\nLast column (rows1-3, index6):0,2,2 \u2192 three elements.\n\nTotal perimeter elements:7+7+3+3=20 elements.\n\nNow count 0s,8s,2s.\n\nFirst row (0,8,0,0,0,0,0): 0s:6, 8:1.\n\nLast row (0,8,0,0,8,0,0): 0s:5, 8s:2.\n\nFirst column (rows1-3, index0): 2,2,0 \u2192 two 2s, one 0.\n\nLast column (rows1-3, index6):0,2,2 \u2192 one 0, two 2s.\n\nSo summing:\n\n0s:6 (first row) +5 (last row) +1 (first column) +1 (last column) =13.\n\n8s:1 (first row) +2 (last row) =3.\n\n2s: in first column:2,2 \u2192 two. Last column:2,2 \u2192 two. Also, first row has no 2s. Last row has no 2s. So total 4 2s.\n\nSo most frequent is 0 (13 times), but the output is 8. So this contradicts that theory. So the perimeter count idea is not correct.\n\nHmm, this is getting complicated. Let's think of another angle.\n\nLooking at Example5's input. Output is [0]. Let's see if there's a pattern with 2s and 8s arranged in a certain way. For instance, maybe each 2 is adjacent (horizontally) to another 2, forming pairs, and 8s are isolated. But how would that determine the output?\n\nAlternatively, the output is 0 if the number of 2s is even, 8 if odd. Let's check:\n\nExample0: count of 2s. Rows:\n\nRow0:0,0,8,0,8 \u2192 0.\n\nRow1:2,2,8,0,0 \u2192 two 2s.\n\nRow2:2,2,0,0,8 \u2192 two 2s.\n\nRow3:0,0,0,2,2 \u2192 two 2s.\n\nRow4:8,8,0,2,2 \u2192 two 2s.\n\nTotal 2s: 2+2+2+2=8 (even). Output is 0. That fits.\n\nExample1's 2s:\n\nRow0:0,8,0,0,0,0,0 \u2192 0.\n\nRow1:2,2,0,8,8,8,0 \u2192 two 2s.\n\nRow2:2,2,8,8,0,2,2 \u2192 four 2s.\n\nRow3:0,0,8,0,0,2,2 \u2192 two 2s.\n\nRow4:0,8,0,0,8,0,0 \u2192 0.\n\nTotal: 2+4+2=8 (even). Output is 8. Doesn't fit. So that's not it.\n\nAnother idea: the output is 0 if the entire matrix contains an even number of 8s, 8 if odd. Let's check.\n\nExample0:\n\nRow0: two 8s.\n\nRow1: one 8.\n\nRow2: one 8.\n\nRow3: zero.\n\nRow4: two 8s.\n\nTotal: 2+1+1+2=6 (even). Output is 0. Fits.\n\nExample1:\n\nRow0: one 8.\n\nRow1: three 8s.\n\nRow2: two 8s.\n\nRow3: one 8.\n\nRow4: two 8s.\n\nTotal:1+3+2+1+2=9 (odd). Output is 8. Fits.\n\nExample2:\n\nCount 8s:\n\nRow0:8,2,2,8,8,0,0 \u2192 three 8s.\n\nRow1:0,2,2,0,0,0,8 \u2192 one 8.\n\nRow2:0,8,8,0,0,8,0 \u2192 three 8s.\n\nRow3:0,0,8,0,0,0,8 \u2192 two 8s.\n\nRow4:8,0,8,8,8,2,2 \u2192 four 8s.\n\nRow5:8,0,0,0,0,2,2 \u2192 one 8.\n\nTotal:3+1+3+2+4+1=14 (even). Output is 8. Doesn't fit. Because 14 is even, output should be 0, but example2's output is 8. So this idea is invalid.\n\nHmm. Another approach: maybe the output is the number that appears in the exact center of the matrix. Let's check example0's matrix: 5x5. Center is row2 (third row), column2 (third column). The third row is [2,2,0,0,8], so center is 0. Output is 0. Fits.\n\nExample1's matrix is 5x7 (rows:5, columns:7). The center row would be row2 (third row), center column is column3 (fourth column). The third row is [2,2,8,8,0,2,2]. Column3 is 8. Output is 8. Fits.\n\nExample2's matrix has 6 rows and 7 columns. Center rows would be rows 3 and 4 (since even number of rows), but columns are 7, center column is 3 (fourth). So check rows3 and4, column3. Row3: [0,0,8,0,0,0,8] \u2192 column3 is 0. Row4: [8,0,8,8,8,2,2] \u2192 column3 is8. So maybe take the average? Or perhaps the output is 8. Which matches example2's output.\n\nExample3's matrix has 6 rows and7 columns. Center rows are 3 and4. Row3: [8,0,0,0,0,0,0], column3 is 0. Row4: [0,2,2,0,8,0,8], column3 is0. So average is 0. Output is 0. Fits.\n\nExample4: 6 rows, 7 columns. Center rows 3 and4. Row3: [0,0,8,0,0,8,0] \u2192 column3 is0. Row4: [0,0,8,2,2,0,8] \u2192 column3 is2. So maybe take the first one? Or sum. Not sure. Output is8. Doesn't fit. So this pattern might not hold.\n\nExample5's input is 6 rows, 6 columns. Center would be rows3 and4. Columns would be 3 and4. So for rows3 and4, columns3 and4. Let's see:\n\nRow3: [2,2,8,0,8,0] \u2192 columns3 is0. Row4: [2,2,0,0,0,8] \u2192 column3 is0. So center elements are 0 and0. Output is0. Fits.\n\nSo this pattern seems to hold for examples0,1,2,3,5 but not example4. Let's check example4.\n\nExample4's input is 6 rows,7 columns. Rows3 and4 are center. Column3 (fourth column). Row3: [0,0,8,0,0,8,0] \u2192 column3 is0. Row4: [0,0,8,2,2,0,8] \u2192 column3 is2. So if the output is determined by the center, but there are two rows in the center (since even number of rows), how is it resolved? Perhaps the first center row's value? Row3's column3 is0. Output is8, which doesn't match. So this theory is incorrect for example4.\n\nBut example4's output is8. So this breaks the pattern. So maybe there's another rule.\n\nWait, perhaps the output is determined by the number of islands of 8s. An island is a group of 8s connected horizontally or vertically. Let's check.\n\nExample0: The 8s are in row0, positions 2 and4. row1, position2. row2, position4. row4, positions0 and1. So the 8s are isolated. So total islands:\n\nRow0: positions2 and4 are isolated. So two islands.\n\nRow1: position2 is an island.\n\nRow2: position4 is an island.\n\nRow4: positions0 and1 are connected, forming one island.\n\nTotal islands: 2+1+1+1=5 (odd). Output is0. But example0's output is0. If even islands output 0, odd output 8, this would fit if 5 is odd. Output is0, which contradicts. Unless the rule is different.\n\nAlternatively, the number of 8 islands modulo 2. 5 mod2 is1. Output is0. So not matching.\n\nAlternatively, if the output is 0 when the number of 8 islands is even, 8 when odd. 5 is odd, so output should be8, but example0's output is0. So this is wrong.\n\nHmm. Let's try to look for another pattern. Maybe the output is the number that forms a closed loop. For example, if there's a ring of 8s around a 0, output is8. But I'm not sure how that would apply here.\n\nLooking at example0's input. There's no such ring. The 8s are scattered. Output is0. Example1's output is8. Maybe there's a ring. Let me check the matrix.\n\nExample1's input has a 5x7 matrix. Let's look for a ring of 8s.\n\nLooking at row2: [2,2,8,8,0,2,2]. Maybe there's a loop. Not sure.\n\nAnother idea: the output is the sum of the corners of the matrix. For example, sum the four corners and take mod10.\n\nExample0's matrix is5x5. Corners are:\n\nTop-left:0, top-right:8, bottom-left:8, bottom-right:2.\n\nSum:0+8+8+2=18. 18 mod10=8. Output is0. Doesn't fit.\n\nExample1's matrix is5x7. Corners: top-left0, top-right0, bottom-left0, bottom-right0. Sum0. mod10=0. Output is8. Doesn't fit.\n\nExample2: matrix6 rows,7 columns. Corners: top-left8, top-right0, bottom-left8, bottom-right2. Sum8+0+8+2=18 mod10=8. Output is8. Fits.\n\nExample3: matrix6 rows,7 columns. Corners: top-left8, top-right0, bottom-left0, bottom-right8. Sum8+0+0+8=16 mod10=6. Output is0. Doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. Not working.\n\nAnother approach: perhaps the output is the number that is in the majority in the first and last elements of each row. Let's check.\n\nExample0: Each row's first and last elements:\n\nRow0:0 and8.\n\nRow1:2 and0.\n\nRow2:2 and8.\n\nRow3:0 and2.\n\nRow4:8 and2.\n\nCount:\n\n0 appears as first element in row0, row3. As last element in row0, row1, row4. So first elements:0,2,2,0,8 \u2192 0 appears twice. Last elements:8,0,8,2,2 \u2192 8 appears twice. So overall, 0 appears in first/last 2+3=5 times? Wait, need to count all first and last elements of each row.\n\nFor example0:\n\nEach row has first and last:\n\nRow0:0,8.\n\nRow1:2,0.\n\nRow2:2,8.\n\nRow3:0,2.\n\nRow4:8,2.\n\nSo all first and last elements:\n\n0,8,2,0,2,8,0,2,8,2.\n\nCount 0: 0,8,0 \u2192 three times.\n\n2: 2,2,2,2 \u2192 four times.\n\n8:8,8,8 \u2192 three times.\n\nSo majority is 2. Output is0. Doesn't match.\n\nAnother idea: Maybe the output is the sum of all the elements in the first and last row. Let's compute.\n\nExample0:\n\nFirst row sum:0+0+8+0+8=16.\n\nLast row sum:8+8+0+2+2=20.\n\nTotal:36. 36 mod10=6. Output is0. No.\n\nExample1:\n\nFirst row sum:0+8+0+0+0+0+0=8.\n\nLast row sum:0+8+0+0+8+0+0=16.\n\nTotal:24. 24 mod10=4. Output is8. No.\n\nHmm.\n\nWait, looking back at the examples, in Example0, the output is [0], which is the same as the element in the very center of the matrix. For example0, a 5x5 matrix, the center is row2, column2. The value there is 0. Example1's center (5 rows, 7 columns) is row2, column3 (since columns are 7, center is at index3). The value there is8. Output is8. Example2's center (6 rows, 7 columns) would be between rows3 and4. If taking row3, column3:0. Row4, column3:8. Maybe average or something. Output is8. Example3's center (6 rows,7 columns) row3 column3:0. Row4 column3:0. Output is0. Example5's center (6 rows,6 columns) would be row3 and4, columns3 and4. If the matrix's center is where these meet, but perhaps it's the cell that's at the center. For example5, which is6x6, the exact center would be between four cells. But maybe the output is determined by the majority in these cells. But this might get complicated.\n\nIn example4, which has6 rows and7 columns, the center rows are3 and4, center column is3 (index3). Row3's column3 is0, row4's column3 is2. Output is8. So this doesn't fit. So maybe this theory is not correct.\n\nAnother angle: look for the number of times 2 appears adjacent to 8. For example, if 2 is next to 8, count how many times. But not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the output is the number that appears in the majority of the corners of the matrix. Example0's corners:0,8,8,2 \u2192 0 appears once, 8 twice, 2 once. So majority is8. Output is0. Doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, the output is the number that appears in the corners the most. If tie, output0. Example0's corners:0 (row0, col0),8 (row0, col4),8 (row4, col0),2 (row4, col4). So 8 appears twice. Output is0. Doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. Let's think differently. Looking at the examples, the outputs are either0 or8. The inputs have 0, 8, and2. Maybe the pattern is based on the presence of certain sequences or the arrangement of2s and8s.\n\nLooking at example0 and example1:\n\nIn example0, the 2s are arranged in pairs: [2,2] in rows1,2,3,4. The output is0.\n\nIn example1, the 2s are also in pairs. Output is8.\n\nNot helpful.\n\nAnother thought: maybe the output is the number of \"blocks\" of 2s. For example, consecutive 2s in a row form a block. If the number of blocks is even, output0; odd, output8. Let's check.\n\nExample0: rows with 2s:\n\nRow1: [2,2] \u2192 one block.\n\nRow2: [2,2] \u2192 one block.\n\nRow3: [2,2] \u2192 one block.\n\nRow4: [2,2] \u2192 one block.\n\nTotal blocks:4. Even. Output0. Fits.\n\nExample1:\n\nRows with 2s:\n\nRow1: [2,2] \u2192 one block.\n\nRow2: [2,2] ... and [2,2] \u2192 two blocks.\n\nRow3: [2,2] \u2192 one block.\n\nTotal blocks:1+2+1=4. Even. Output is8. Doesn't fit.\n\nSo this idea is incorrect.\n\nAlternative idea: the output is 0 if the number of 2s is even, 8 if odd. Example0 has 8 2s (even) \u2192 output0. Example1: count 2s:\n\nRow1:2,2 \u2192 2.\n\nRow2:2,2,2,2 \u21924.\n\nRow3:2,2 \u21922.\n\nTotal:2+4+2=8 (even). Output is8. Doesn't fit.\n\nAnother approach: look for symmetry. For example, the matrix is symmetric in some way, and the output depends on whether it's symmetric. Let's check.\n\nExample0's input:\n\nRow0: [0,0,8,0,8]\n\nRow1: [2,2,8,0,0]\n\nRow2: [2,2,0,0,8]\n\nRow3: [0,0,0,2,2]\n\nRow4: [8,8,0,2,2]\n\nLooking for vertical symmetry (mirror over the center column). For row0, the elements are 0,0,8,0,8. If mirrored, the first element should match the last. 0 and8: no. So not symmetric. Similarly for other rows.\n\nHorizontal symmetry? Like row0 and row4. Row0:0,0,8,0,8. Row4:8,8,0,2,2. Not mirrors. So symmetry doesn't seem to be a factor.\n\nMaybe the matrix has a certain balance between 2s and 8s. Like if the sum of 2s and 8s is even or odd. But example0's sum is 2s:8, 8s:6. 8+6=14 even. Output0. Example1: 2s:8, 8s:9. 8+9=17, odd. Output8. But example2's 2s: sum of 2s is let's see:\n\nExample2's input:\n\nRow0:8,2,2,8,8,0,0 \u2192 two 2s.\n\nRow1:0,2,2,0,0,0,8 \u2192 two 2s.\n\nRow2:0,8,8,0,0,8,0 \u2192 no 2s.\n\nRow3:0,0,8,0,0,0,8 \u2192 no.\n\nRow4:8,0,8,8,8,2,2 \u2192 two 2s.\n\nRow5:8,0,0,0,0,2,2 \u2192 two 2s.\n\nTotal 2s:2+2+2+2=8. 8s:3+1+3+2+4+1=14. 8+14=22 even. Output8. Doesn't fit.\n\nSo this idea is also wrong.\n\nAnother possible pattern: the output is the result of XOR between the count of 2s and 8s. But not sure.\n\nExample0: 8 2s,6 8s. 8 XOR6 = 14 (1110 in binary). Output0. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is0 if there are more 0s than 8s and 2s combined. But in example0, let's count 0s.\n\nExample0: each row:\n\nRow0:0,0,8,0,8 \u21924 zeros.\n\nRow1:2,2,8,0,0 \u2192 two zeros.\n\nRow2:2,2,0,0,8 \u2192 three zeros.\n\nRow3:0,0,0,2,2 \u2192 three zeros.\n\nRow4:8,8,0,2,2 \u2192 one zero.\n\nTotal zeros:4+2+3+3+1=13. 2s:8. 8s:6. Total non-zero:14. 13 zeros. So more zeros. Output is0. Fits.\n\nExample1:\n\nCount zeros.\n\nRow0:0,8,0,0,0,0,0 \u2192 six zeros.\n\nRow1:2,2,0,8,8,8,0 \u2192 two zeros.\n\nRow2:2,2,8,8,0,2,2 \u2192 one zero.\n\nRow3:0,0,8,0,0,2,2 \u2192 three zeros.\n\nRow4:0,8,0,0,8,0,0 \u2192 five zeros.\n\nTotal zeros:6+2+1+3+5=17. 2s:8. 8s:9. Non-zero:17. Zeros:17. So equal. Output is8. Hmm, not sure.\n\nExample2's zeros:\n\nRow0:0,0 \u2192 two zeros.\n\nRow1:0,0,0,0 \u2192 four zeros.\n\nRow2:0,0,0 \u2192 three zeros.\n\nRow3:0,0,0,0 \u2192 four zeros.\n\nRow4:0 \u2192 one zero.\n\nRow5:0,0,0,0 \u2192 four zeros.\n\nTotal zeros:2+4+3+4+1+4=18. 2s:8. 8s:14. Non-zero:22. Zeros:18. So more non-zeros. Output is8. Fits.\n\nExample3: output0. Let's count zeros.\n\nRow0:8,8,0,0,2,2,0 \u2192 three zeros.\n\nRow1:0,8,8,0,2,2,8 \u2192 two zeros.\n\nRow2:0,0,0,8,0,8,0 \u2192 five zeros.\n\nRow3:8,0,0,0,0,0,0 \u2192 six zeros.\n\nRow4:0,2,2,0,8,0,8 \u2192 three zeros.\n\nRow5:0,2,2,8,8,0,8 \u2192 one zero.\n\nTotal zeros:3+2+5+6+3+1=20. Non-zeros:2s:8,8s: (row0:2, row1:3, row2:2, row5:3) 2+3+2+3=10. So 8+10=18. 20 zeros. So more zeros. Output0. Fits.\n\nExample4: output8. Count zeros.\n\nRow0:8,0,0,0,0,8,0 \u2192 five zeros.\n\nRow1:0,0,2,2,0,8,0 \u2192 four zeros.\n\nRow2:8,0,2,2,0,0,0 \u2192 four zeros.\n\nRow3:0,0,8,0,0,8,0 \u2192 five zeros.\n\nRow4:0,0,8,2,2,0,8 \u2192 three zeros.\n\nRow5:8,0,0,2,2,8,0 \u2192 four zeros.\n\nTotal zeros:5+4+4+5+3+4=25. 2s: row1:2, row2:2, row4:2, row5:2. Total 8. 8s: row0:2, row1:1, row3:2, row4:1, row5:1. Total 7. Non-zeros:8+7=15. Zeros:25. So more zeros. Output is8. But according to previous examples, when zeros are more, output is0. But here, output is8. So this contradicts.\n\nHmm. So this pattern holds for examples0,3, but not example4. So this theory is invalid.\n\nBack to the drawing board. Let's think of the outputs and see if there's a common thread. Examples0 and3 output0. Examples1,2,4 output8. Example5 outputs0.\n\nLooking at the test input's structure. Let me try to apply the previous pattern where the output is the sum of all elements modulo10. Let's compute for the test input.\n\nTest Input has8 rows. Let's list them:\n\nRow0: [2,2,8,8,0,8]\n\nRow1: [2,2,0,8,0,0]\n\nRow2: [8,8,0,0,0,8]\n\nRow3: [0,8,8,8,0,0]\n\nRow4: [8,0,8,0,0,8]\n\nRow5: [0,0,8,2,2,0]\n\nRow6: [8,0,0,2,2,0]\n\nRow7: [0,8,0,0,0,8]\n\nSum each row:\n\nRow0:2+2+8+8+0+8=28\n\nRow1:2+2+0+8+0+0=12\n\nRow2:8+8+0+0+0+8=24\n\nRow3:0+8+8+8+0+0=24\n\nRow4:8+0+8+0+0+8=24\n\nRow5:0+0+8+2+2+0=12\n\nRow6:8+0+0+2+2+0=12\n\nRow7:0+8+0+0+0+8=16\n\nTotal sum:28+12=40; +24=64; +24=88; +24=112; +12=124; +12=136; +16=152.\n\n152 mod10 is2. So output would be [2], but all training examples output 0 or8. So this can't be.\n\nAnother angle: maybe the output is the number that forms the majority in the last row of the input matrix.\n\nExample0's last row: [8,8,0,2,2]. 8s:2, 2s:2, 0:1. No majority. Output0.\n\nExample1's last row: [0,8,0,0,8,0,0]. 0s:5, 8s:2. Majority is0. Output8. Doesn't fit.\n\nExample2's last row: [8,0,0,0,0,2,2]. 0s:4, 8:1, 2s:2. Output8. Doesn't fit.\n\nExample3's last row: [0,2,2,8,8,0,8]. 0:1, 2:2,8:4. Majority is8. Output0. Doesn't fit.\n\nSo this isn't working.\n\nWait, perhaps the output is the number that appears in the first and last positions of the matrix. For example, first element of the first row and last element of the last row.\n\nExample0: first element0, last element2. Output0. Doesn't match.\n\nExample1: first0, last0. Output8. Doesn't match.\n\nHmm.\n\nAnother possible pattern: the output is determined by whether the number of 8s in the even rows is even or odd. Let's check.\n\nExample0 has5 rows (rows0-4):\n\nEven rows (0,2,4):\n\nRow0: two 8s (even).\n\nRow2: one 8 (odd).\n\nRow4: two 8s (even).\n\nTotal even rows: 2+1+2=5 8s. Odd. Output0.\n\nExample1 has5 rows:\n\nEven rows0,2,4:\n\nRow0: one 8 (odd).\n\nRow2: two 8s (even).\n\nRow4: two 8s (even).\n\nTotal:1+2+2=5 (odd). Output8.\n\nExample2 has6 rows (rows0-5):\n\nEven rows0,2,4:\n\nRow0: three 8s (odd).\n\nRow2: three 8s (odd).\n\nRow4: four 8s (even).\n\nTotal:3+3+4=10 (even). Output8. Doesn't fit.\n\nExample3 has6 rows:\n\nEven rows0,2,4:\n\nRow0: two 8s (even).\n\nRow2: zero 8s (even).\n\nRow4: one 8 (odd).\n\nTotal:2+0+1=3 (odd). Output0. Fits.\n\nExample4 has6 rows:\n\nEven rows0,2,4:\n\nRow0: two 8s (even).\n\nRow2: zero 8s (even).\n\nRow4: one 8 (odd).\n\nTotal:2+0+1=3 (odd). Output8. Doesn't fit.\n\nExample5 has6 rows:\n\nEven rows0,2,4:\n\nRow0: one 8.\n\nRow2: zero 8s.\n\nRow4: one 8.\n\nTotal:1+0+1=2 (even). Output0. Fits.\n\nHmm. So for examples0,1,3,5 it fits, but not for 2 and4. So this isn't the correct pattern.\n\nGiven that time is limited, perhaps the correct pattern is that the output is the sum of all elements modulo 10. Let's recheck the examples where this works and where it doesn't.\n\nExample0 sum64 mod10=4. Output0. No.\n\nExample1 sum88 mod10=8. Output8. Yes.\n\nExample2 sum128 mod10=8. Output8. Yes.\n\nExample3 sum120 mod10=0. Output0. Yes.\n\nExample4 sum96 mod10=6. Output8. No.\n\nExample5 sum (let me compute):\n\nExample5's input:\n\nRow0:8,0,0,2,2,8 \u21928+0+0+2+2+8=20.\n\nRow1:8,0,8,2,2,0 \u21928+0+8+2+2+0=20.\n\nRow2:0,0,0,0,8,0 \u21920+0+0+0+8+0=8.\n\nRow3:2,2,8,0,8,0 \u21922+2+8+0+8+0=20.\n\nRow4:2,2,0,0,0,8 \u21922+2+0+0+0+8=12.\n\nRow5:0,8,8,0,8,0 \u21920+8+8+0+8+0=24.\n\nSum:20+20=40+8=48+20=68+12=80+24=104. 104 mod10=4. Output0. Doesn't fit. So this theory is invalid.\n\nHmm. Let's think of another approach. Maybe the output is the number of 8s minus the number of 2s, modulo10. Let's check.\n\nExample0: 8s=6, 2s=8. 6-8= -2 mod10=8. Output0. No.\n\nExample1:8s=9, 2s=8. 1 mod10=1. Output8. No.\n\nExample2:8s=14, 2s=8. 6 mod10=6. Output8. No.\n\nExample3:8s=10, 2s=8. 2 mod10=2. Output0. No.\n\nNot working.\n\nAnother idea: Maybe the output is determined by the number of times the number 8 appears in the diagonal. For example, main diagonal.\n\nExample0's main diagonal (5x5):\n\nRow0:0, row1:2, row2:0, row3:2, row4:2. So no 8s. Output0. Fits.\n\nExample1's main diagonal (5x7 matrix):\n\nRow0:0, row1:2, row2:8, row3:0, row4:0. One 8. Output8. Fits.\n\nExample2's main diagonal (6x7 matrix):\n\nRow0:8, row1:2, row2:0, row3:0, row4:8, row5:2. Two 8s. Output8. Doesn't fit. Because two is even.\n\nBut output is8. So this theory is invalid.\n\nAlternative diagonal: antidiagonal.\n\nExample0's antidiagonal (5x5):\n\nRow0:8 (index4), row1:0 (index3), row2:0 (index2), row3:0 (index1), row4:8 (index0). 8s: two. Output0. Fits.\n\nExample1's antidiagonal (5x7):\n\nRow0:0 (index6), row1:0 (index5), row2:2 (index4), row3:8 (index3), row4:0 (index2). 8:1. Output8. Fits.\n\nExample2's antidiagonal (6x7):\n\nRow0:0 (index6), row1:0 (index5), row2:8 (index4), row3:0 (index3), row4:2 (index2), row5:2 (index1). 8:1. Output8. Fits.\n\nExample3's antidiagonal (6x7):\n\nRow0:0 (index6), row1:8 (index5), row2:0 (index4), row3:0 (index3), row4:8 (index2), row5:8 (index1). 8s:3. Output0. Doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. This works for examples0,1,2, but not3. So not the correct pattern.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and the lack of a clear pattern, I'll have to make an educated guess. Observing that in the training examples, when the sum of all elements modulo10 equals the output (examples1,2,3,5), except for example0 and4. Wait, no. Example0's sum is64 mod10=4, output0. Example4's sum is96 mod10=6, output8.\n\nBut maybe the output is 8 if the sum modulo10 is even, and 0 if odd. Example0 sum64 mod10=4 even \u2192 output0. No. That doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, output is 8 if the sum is a multiple of 8, else 0. Example0 sum64 is 8*8 \u2192 yes. Output0. No.\n\nAnother desperate attempt: maybe the output is the number that is present in the entire matrix but not in the first and last rows. For example:\n\nExample0's first row has0,0,8,0,8. Last row has8,8,0,2,2. The other numbers present are 2. So output is0, which is present. No. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, the output is the number that is not present in the first and last rows but present elsewhere.\n\nExample0's first row has0,8. Last row has8,2. Other rows have2. So 2 is present elsewhere. Output0. Not matching.\n\nThis is challenging. Let's consider that the output is based on the presence of a \"path\" of 8s from the top-left to bottom-right corner. If such a path exists, output8, else0. Let's check.\n\nExample0: No path. Output0. Example1: Maybe a path exists. Output8. Example2: Possible path. Output8. Example3: No path. Output0. Example4: Path? Output8. Example5: No path. Output0. This could fit. Let's see.\n\nExample0's matrix:\n\nRows:\n\n[0,0,8,0,8]\n\n[2,2,8,0,0]\n\n[2,2,0,0,8]\n\n[0,0,0,2,2]\n\n[8,8,0,2,2]\n\nTo move from top-left (0,0) to bottom-right (4,4), each step must be to adjacent (up, down, left, right) 8s. The first cell is0, so no path. Output0. Correct.\n\nExample1's matrix:\n\nFirst cell is0. Can't start. But output is8. So this theory is invalid.\n\nExample2's matrix:\n\nFirst cell is8. Let's see if there's a path of 8s to the end.\n\nRow0:8,2,2,8,8,0,0 \u2192 first is8.\n\nFrom there, can move to adjacent 8s. Let's see. But the path would need to reach the bottom-right (row5, column6). Not sure. This is time-consuming to verify, but perhaps possible. Output8. Fits.\n\nExample3's matrix:\n\nFirst cell is8. Let's see if a path exists to bottom-right. Output0. So no path.\n\nExample4's matrix:\n\nFirst cell is8. Path possible? Output8. \n\nExample5's first cell is8. Output0. So no path.\n\nThis theory could fit some examples, but it's hard to verify quickly. But given the time constraints, I'll go with the sum modulo10 for examples where it works and make a guess for others.\n\nBut looking at the test input:\n\nSum is152. Mod10 is2. None of the training examples have output2, so this can't be.\n\nAlternatively, the sum of all 8s minus sum of all 2s modulo10.\n\nTest input:\n\nCount of 8s and 2s.\n\nRow0:8,8,8 \u2192 three 8s. 2s: two.\n\nRow1:8 \u2192 one 8. 2s: two.\n\nRow2:8,8,8 \u2192 three 8s. 2s: none.\n\nRow3:8,8,8 \u2192 three 8s. 2s: none.\n\nRow4:8,8,8 \u2192 three 8s. 2s: none.\n\nRow5:8 \u2192 one 8. 2s: two.\n\nRow6: none. 2s: two.\n\nRow7:8,8 \u2192 two 8s. 2s: none.\n\nTotal 8s:3+1+3+3+3+1+2=16.\n\nTotal 2s:2+2+2+2=8.\n\n16-8=8. Mod10=8. Output8.\n\nWhich fits the training examples where 8-2=6 mod10=6 (example4's output is8, which doesn't fit. But perhaps the rule is different). But for the test input, this gives8. Let's check training examples:\n\nExample0: 8s=6, 2s=8. 6-8= -2 mod10=8. Output0. Doesn't fit.\n\nExample1:8s=9, 2s=8. 9-8=1 mod10=1. Output8. No.\n\nSo this theory isn't correct.\n\nGiven that I'm stuck, I'll try to look for another approach. Let's check the parity of the number of 8s and 2s.\n\nExample0:\n\n8s:6 (even), 2s:8 (even). Output0.\n\nExample1:8s9 (odd), 2s8 (even). Output8.\n\nExample2:8s14 (even), 2s8 (even). Output8.\n\nExample3:8s10 (even), 2s8 (even). Output0.\n\nExample4:8s7 (odd), 2s8 (even). Output8.\n\nExample5:8s (count for example5's input):\n\nRow0:8,0,0,2,2,8 \u2192 two 8s.\n\nRow1:8,0,8,2,2,0 \u2192 two 8s.\n\nRow2:0,0,0,0,8,0 \u2192 one 8.\n\nRow3:2,2,8,0,8,0 \u2192 two 8s.\n\nRow4:2,2,0,0,0,8 \u2192 one 8.\n\nRow5:0,8,8,0,8,0 \u2192 three 8s.\n\nTotal 8s:2+2+1+2+1+3=11 (odd). 2s: row0:2, row1:2, row3:2, row4:2 \u2192 eight 2s (even). Output0.\n\nSo output0 when 8s are odd and 2s even. Hmm.\n\nExample0: even 8s and even 2s \u21920.\n\nExample1: odd 8s and even 2s \u21928.\n\nExample2: even 8s and even 2s \u21928.\n\nExample3: even 8s and even 2s \u21920.\n\nExample4: odd 8s and even 2s \u21928.\n\nExample5: odd 8s and even 2s \u21920.\n\nSo there's inconsistency here. But in examples1 and4, when 8s are odd and 2s even, output is8. In example5, same conditions output0. So this isn't the pattern.\n\nAnother possibility: output is 8 when the number of 8s is odd, else0. Example0:6\u2192even\u21920. Example1:9\u2192odd\u21928. Example2:14\u2192even\u21928. No. Example2 is even but output is8. So no.\n\nExample4:7\u2192odd\u21928. Fits. Example5:11\u2192odd\u21920. Doesn't fit.\n\nSo this pattern doesn't hold.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and not finding a clear pattern, I'll have to make an educated guess based on the majority of the examples. Since the test input's sum is 152 mod10=2, which doesn't help, but the count of 8s is16 and 2s is8. 16-8=8. Maybe output is8. Which aligns with examples1,2,4. So I'll guess the output is [8].",

        "cot_2": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. So, the problem gives several examples of input grids and their corresponding outputs, which are either [0] or [8]. My task is to determine the rule that transforms the input into the output and apply it to the test input.\n\nLooking at the examples, let's start by examining the first few. \n\nIn Example 0, the input has rows with 0s, 2s, and 8s. The output is [0]. Similarly, Example 1 outputs [8]. Let's see if there's a common element in the rows that determines the output.\n\nWait, maybe the output is related to the number of certain digits in the grid. Let's check:\n\nExample 0's input has 8s, 2s, and 0s. Let me count how many 8s and 2s there are. For example, the first row is [0,0,8,0,8], so two 8s. The second row has two 2s. The third row two 2s again. The fourth and fifth rows also have two 2s each. So maybe there's a connection between the number of 2s or 8s in each row. But the output is 0 here. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is determined by which number (0 or 8) forms a closed loop or circle. Because 8 is like two circles, and 0 is a circle. But how does that apply here? Let's think of the numbers as their shapes. Maybe the output is the number (0 or 8) that appears in the grid and forms a loop when arranged in certain positions. But how?\n\nLooking at Example 1's output is 8. Let's check the rows. The third row is [2,2,8,8,0,2,2]. There's an 8 in the middle. Maybe the pattern is related to the presence of 8s forming a ring or surrounding something. Alternatively, perhaps the output is the number that is in the center of the grid? But the grids vary in size. For instance, Example 0's grid is 5x5, Example 1's is 5x7, so varying rows and columns. That complicates the center idea.\n\nAnother approach: look for the presence of sequences. For example, maybe the output is determined by the number that appears in a specific position across all rows. Like, for each row, if the first element is a 0 or 8, but that might not hold. Let's check:\n\nExample 0's first row starts with 0. The output is 0. But in Example 1, the first row starts with 0, output is 8. So that's inconsistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the majority number in the borders of the grid. Let's check. For Example 0's grid:\n\nThe borders would be the first and last rows, and the first and last elements of the middle rows. Let's see:\n\nFirst row: [0,0,8,0,8] \u2192 elements 0,0,8,0,8. So 0s and 8s. Last row: [8,8,0,2,2] \u2192 8,8,0,2,2. The borders here are 8 and 2. The first elements of the middle rows: 2,2,0,8. The last elements of the middle rows: 0,8,2,2. Not sure if majority here. The output is 0. Hmm, maybe not.\n\nAnother thought: maybe the output is the number that appears in the exact center of the grid when arranged in a certain way. But grids vary in size. Example 0 is 5x5, so center is position (3,3). Let's see: looking at Example 0's input, the third row is [2,2,0,0,8], and the third element is 0. The output is 0. Maybe that's it. But let's check Example 1. The input is 5 rows, each of 7 elements. The third row is [2,2,8,8,0,2,2]. The center position would be the 4th element (since 7 elements), which is 8. The output is 8. That fits. Example 2's grid is 6 rows. Wait, Example 2's input has 6 rows, each with 7 elements. So the center would be between rows 3 and 4. Hmm. But the output is 8. Let's check the middle rows. The third row's center is position 4: [0,8,8,0,0,8,0] \u2192 4th element is 0. Fourth row's center is 0. Hmm, but output is 8. So maybe that's not the pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is determined by the parity of the number of 8s or 2s. Let's count the total 8s and 2s in each example.\n\nExample 0: Let's count 8s. First row has two 8s. Second row: one 8. Third row: one 8. Fourth row: none. Fifth row: two 8s. Total 2+1+1+2=6. 2s: rows 2,3,4,5 have 2s. Let's count: row 2 has two 2s. Row 3 has two 2s. Row4 has two 2s. Row5 has two 2s. Total 2+2+2+2=8. So 8 2s. Output is 0. Hmm, maybe not directly the count. But maybe 8 2s and 6 8s. Output is 0. Not sure.\n\nExample 1: output is 8. Let's count 8s. Row1: one 8. Row2: three 8s. Row3: two 8s. Row4: one 8. Row5: two 8s. Total 1+3+2+1+2=9. 2s: row2 has two 2s. Row3 has two 2s. Row4: two 2s. Row5: none. So 2+2+2=6. Output is 8. Maybe when the number of 8s is higher than 2s, output is 8? But in Example 0, 8s are 6, 2s are 8. So 8s less than 2s, output 0. That fits. Example 1: 8s=9, 2s=6. So 8s >2s \u2192 output 8. Example 2's output is 8. Let's check. Count 8s and 2s.\n\nExample 2 input:\n\nRow1: 8,2,2,8,8,0,0 \u2192 8s: 3, 2s:2.\nRow2: 0,2,2,0,0,0,8 \u2192 8s:1, 2s:2.\nRow3:0,8,8,0,0,8,0 \u2192 8s:3.\nRow4:0,0,8,0,0,0,8 \u2192 8s:2.\nRow5:8,0,8,8,8,2,2 \u2192 8s:4, 2s:2.\nRow6:8,0,0,0,0,2,2 \u2192 8s:1, 2s:2.\nTotal 8s: 3+1+3+2+4+1=14. 2s: 2+2+0+0+2+2=8. So 14 vs 8. Output is 8. Which fits.\n\nExample3 output is 0. Let's check. 8s and 2s.\n\nRows:\n\nRow1:8,8,0,0,2,2,0 \u2192 8s:2, 2s:2.\nRow2:0,8,8,0,2,2,8 \u2192 8s:4, 2s:2.\nRow3:0,0,0,8,0,8,0 \u2192 8s:2.\nRow4:8,0,0,0,0,0,0 \u2192 8s:1.\nRow5:0,2,2,0,8,0,8 \u2192 8s:2, 2s:2.\nRow6:0,2,2,8,8,0,8 \u2192 8s:3, 2s:2.\nTotal 8s: 2+4+2+1+2+3=14. 2s:2+2+0+0+2+2=8. Wait, same counts as Example2. But Example3's output is 0. So that contradicts the previous idea. Because 8s count (14) is higher than 2s (8) here but output is 0. So that can't be the pattern. So maybe the counts aren't the key.\n\nHmm, back to the drawing board. Let's look for another pattern. Maybe the output is the number (0 or 8) that forms a closed loop in the grid. So 0 and 8 are the only numbers that form closed loops. But how to check that in the grid.\n\nAlternatively, the output could be based on which number (0 or 8) is completely enclosed by the other. Like, if 0s are surrounded by 8s, or vice versa. But how?\n\nAnother angle: perhaps the output is determined by the parity of the number of times 0 and 8 appear in certain positions. For example, maybe the sum of all elements modulo something. Let's check:\n\nExample0's sum of all elements: Let's compute.\n\nRow1: 0+0+8+0+8=16\nRow2: 2+2+8+0+0=12\nRow3:2+2+0+0+8=12\nRow4:0+0+0+2+2=4\nRow5:8+8+0+2+2=20\nTotal sum:16+12+12+4+20=64. 64 mod 8 is 0. Output is [0]. Hmm, that fits.\n\nExample1's sum: Let's compute.\n\nRow1:0+8+0+0+0+0+0=8\nRow2:2+2+0+8+8+8+0=28\nRow3:2+2+8+8+0+2+2=24\nRow4:0+0+8+0+0+2+2=12\nRow5:0+8+0+0+8+0+0=16\nSum:8+28=36, +24=60, +12=72, +16=88. 88 mod 8 is 0 (since 8*11=88). But output is 8. So that doesn't fit. So maybe the sum modulo 8 is not the pattern.\n\nAlternative idea: maybe the output is the sum of all 8s and 2s in the grid modulo 2. Let's see:\n\nExample0: 8s count is 6, 2s count 8. 6+8=14. 14 mod 2=0. Output is 0. That fits.\n\nExample1: 8s=9, 2s=6. 9+6=15. 15 mod 2=1. Output is 8. Hmm, but 1 would correspond to 8? Maybe. Let's check Example2:\n\n8s=14, 2s=8. 14+8=22. 22 mod 2=0. Output is 8. So that doesn't fit. Because 0 would correspond to output 0. So this idea is invalid.\n\nHmm. Another approach: look for the presence of certain patterns in the grid. For example, maybe the output is 8 if there's an 8 that is adjacent (horizontally or vertically) to two 2s, or something like that. Let's check.\n\nIn Example1's output is 8. Let's see if any 8 is adjacent to two 2s. For instance, in row2: [2,2,0,8,8,8,0]. The 8s are adjacent to 0s and 2s. The first two 8s are after 0, so maybe not. The third 8 is next to another 8 and 0. Not sure. Alternatively, maybe the output is based on the presence of certain shapes made by 2s and 8s. For example, 2s might form a square or something, and 8s surround them. But this is getting vague.\n\nWait, looking at the examples again, perhaps the output is determined by the number (0 or 8) that appears in all four corners of the grid. Let's check.\n\nExample0's grid is 5x5. Corners would be first and last elements of each row. Wait, maybe the four corners of the entire grid. For a 5x5 grid, the four corners are:\n\nTop-left: [0][0] = 0\n\nTop-right: [0][4] =8\n\nBottom-left: [4][0] =8\n\nBottom-right: [4][4] =2\n\nSo the corners are 0,8,8,2. None of these are the same. Output is 0. Hmm.\n\nExample1's input is 5x7. Corners:\n\nTop-left:0\n\nTop-right:0\n\nBottom-left:0 (row5 starts with 0)\n\nBottom-right:0 (row5 ends with 0). So all four corners are 0. But output is 8. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the center of the grid. For Example0, the center is row3, column3 (0-based index 2,2). The value there is 0. Output is 0. For Example1, the center is in row2 (since 5 rows) column3 (7 columns). The value is 8. Output is 8. For Example2, grid is 6 rows and 7 columns. The center would be between rows 3 and 4. Column 3. Let's see row3: [0,8,8,0,0,8,0]. Column3 is 0. Row4: [0,0,8,0,0,0,8]. Column3 is 0. So average between 0 and 0 is 0, but output is 8. So that doesn't fit. Hmm.\n\nAnother angle: perhaps the output is the number that appears in the majority of the middle elements of each row. Let's think. For each row, take the middle element (if odd length) or the two middle elements (even length) and see which number (0 or 8) is more frequent.\n\nExample0's rows:\n\nRow1: [0,0,8,0,8] \u2192 middle is 8. \n\nRow2: [2,2,8,0,0] \u2192 middle is 8.\n\nRow3: [2,2,0,0,8] \u2192 middle is 0.\n\nRow4: [0,0,0,2,2] \u2192 middle is 0.\n\nRow5: [8,8,0,2,2] \u2192 middle is 0.\n\nMiddle elements: 8,8,0,0,0. Majority is 0. Output is 0. That fits.\n\nExample1's rows are 7 elements each. Middle is 4th element.\n\nRow1: [0,8,0,0,0,0,0] \u2192 middle element (index3) is 0.\n\nRow2: [2,2,0,8,8,8,0] \u2192 middle is 8.\n\nRow3: [2,2,8,8,0,2,2] \u2192 middle is 8.\n\nRow4: [0,0,8,0,0,2,2] \u2192 middle is 0.\n\nRow5: [0,8,0,0,8,0,0] \u2192 middle is 0.\n\nMiddle elements: 0,8,8,0,0. Majority is 0 (3 times) and 8 (2 times). But output is 8. So this contradicts.\n\nHmm, maybe not. Let's check Example2. Example2 has 6 rows, each 7 elements. Middle elements for each row (index3):\n\nRow1:8,2,2,8,8,0,0 \u2192 index3 is 8.\n\nRow2:0,2,2,0,0,0,8 \u2192 index3 is 0.\n\nRow3:0,8,8,0,0,8,0 \u2192 index3 is 0.\n\nRow4:0,0,8,0,0,0,8 \u2192 index3 is 0.\n\nRow5:8,0,8,8,8,2,2 \u2192 index3 is8.\n\nRow6:8,0,0,0,0,2,2 \u2192 index3 is0.\n\nMiddle elements:8,0,0,0,8,0. Majority is 0 (4 times). Output is 8. So again, contradicts. So this approach doesn't work.\n\nAnother thought: maybe the output is the number that appears in the diagonal of the grid. For example, the main diagonal (from top-left to bottom-right). Let's check Example0:\n\nRow0: 0 at (0,0).\n\nRow1:2 at (1,1).\n\nRow2:0 at (2,2).\n\nRow3:2 at (3,3).\n\nRow4:2 at (4,4).\n\nSo diagonal is 0,2,0,2,2. The output is 0. Not sure.\n\nExample1's diagonal (5 rows, 7 columns):\n\nRow0:0 at (0,0).\n\nRow1:2 at (1,1).\n\nRow2:8 at (2,2).\n\nRow3:0 at (3,3).\n\nRow4:8 at (4,4).\n\nSo diagonal elements:0,2,8,0,8. Output is8. So maybe majority here. But in Example0, majority is 0 and 2. So not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the sum of diagonal elements modulo 10. Example0's diagonal sum is 0+2+0+2+2=6 \u2192 6 mod 10=6. Output is0. Doesn't fit. Example1's sum:0+2+8+0+8=18 \u2192 18 mod 10=8. Output is8. That fits. Example2's diagonal (6 rows, 7 columns):\n\nRow0:8 at (0,0).\n\nRow1:2 at (1,1).\n\nRow2:0 at (2,2).\n\nRow3:0 at (3,3).\n\nRow4:8 at (4,4).\n\nRow5:0 at (5,5).\n\nSo diagonal elements:8,2,0,0,8,0. Sum:8+2+0+0+8+0=18 \u2192 18 mod10=8. Output is8. Fits.\n\nExample3's output is0. Let's check diagonal elements. Example3's input:\n\nRows:\n\nRow0:8,8,0,0,2,2,0 \u2192 (0,0)=8.\n\nRow1:0,8,8,0,2,2,8 \u2192 (1,1)=8.\n\nRow2:0,0,0,8,0,8,0 \u2192 (2,2)=0.\n\nRow3:8,0,0,0,0,0,0 \u2192 (3,3)=0.\n\nRow4:0,2,2,0,8,0,8 \u2192 (4,4)=8.\n\nRow5:0,2,2,8,8,0,8 \u2192 (5,5)=0.\n\nSo diagonal elements:8,8,0,0,8,0. Sum:8+8+0+0+8+0=24 \u2192 mod10=4. Output is0. Doesn't fit. So this pattern works for Example1, Example2, but not Example0 and Example3. So maybe this isn't the rule.\n\nWait, Example0's sum is6 mod10=6, output is0. Example3's sum24 mod10=4, output0. So maybe if the sum mod10 is even, output0, else 8? Let's see:\n\nExample0 sum6 \u2192 even \u21920.\n\nExample1 sum18 \u2192 even \u2192 output8. Doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. Not consistent.\n\nAlternative idea: Perhaps the output is determined by the number that appears as the first or last element in the grid's rows. For example, if all rows start with 0, output 0, else 8. Let's check:\n\nExample0's rows:\n\nRow0 starts with0.\n\nRow1 starts with2.\n\nRow2 starts with2.\n\nRow3 starts with0.\n\nRow4 starts with8.\n\nNot all start with0. Output is0. So that's not it.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the first element of the row that is different from others. Not sure.\n\nAnother approach: Let's look for the presence of 'islands' of 2s and 8s. For example, maybe the output is 8 if there are more 8 islands than 0 islands, and vice versa. But this would require image processing-like analysis, which is complex.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is 0 if the number of 2s is even and 8 if odd, or something similar. Let's check:\n\nExample0: 2s count is8 (even) \u2192 output0. Example1:2s count6 (even) \u2192 output8. Doesn't fit. Example2:2s count8 (even) \u2192 output8. No. So that's not it.\n\nWait, maybe the output is determined by the parity of the number of rows. Example0 has5 rows (odd) \u2192 output0. Example1 has5 (odd) \u2192 output8. So no.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the number that appears in the same position in all rows. For example, the third element of each row. Let's check Example0:\n\nRow0 third element:8.\n\nRow1:8.\n\nRow2:0.\n\nRow3:0.\n\nRow4:0. So mostly 0s. Output is0. Example1's third elements:\n\nRow0:0.\n\nRow1:0.\n\nRow2:8.\n\nRow3:8.\n\nRow4:0. So mostly 0s and 8s. Output is8. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is the sum of the first elements of each row modulo something. Example0: first elements are0,2,2,0,8. Sum:0+2+2+0+8=12. 12 mod8=4 \u2192 output0. No. Example1's first elements:0,2,2,0,0. Sum4 \u2192 mod8=4. Output8. Not matching.\n\nHmm, this is tricky. Let's think differently. Maybe the output is the number (0 or8) that forms a path from the top to the bottom of the grid. For example, a vertical line of 8s or 0s. Let's check.\n\nExample0: Looking for any column that has all 8s or 0s. Column0:0,2,2,0,8 \u2192 mixed. Column1:0,2,2,0,8 \u2192 mixed. Column2:8,8,0,0,0. So column2 has 8,8,0,0,0. Not all same. Output is0. Maybe not.\n\nExample1: Any column with all 8s? Let's check column3 (since rows have 7 elements). Column3 for each row:\n\nRow0:0.\n\nRow1:8.\n\nRow2:8.\n\nRow3:0.\n\nRow4:0. So no. Output is8. Not sure.\n\nAlternative idea: Looking at the training examples, notice that when the output is 0, the input grids have 2s arranged in pairs, and 8s might be adjacent to 0s. For example, in Example0, the 2s are in pairs in multiple rows. But how does that determine the output?\n\nWait, perhaps the output is 0 if there are more even-length sequences of 2s, and 8 otherwise. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is 0 when the number of 2 pairs (like two 2s in a row) is even, and 8 when odd. Let's count pairs.\n\nExample0: Each row has two 2s in a row. Let's count the number of such pairs.\n\nRow2: two 2s. Row3: two 2s. Row4: two 2s. Row5: two 2s. So 4 pairs. Even. Output0.\n\nExample1: rows with 2s in pairs:\n\nRow1: two 2s. Row2: two 2s. Row3: two 2s. So 3 pairs. Odd. Output8.\n\nExample2: rows with two 2s:\n\nRow1: two 2s. Row2: two 2s. Row5: two 2s. Row6: two 2s. So 4 pairs. Even. Output8. Doesn't fit.\n\nSo this idea doesn't hold.\n\nAnother thought: Maybe the output is determined by whether the sum of all 2s and 8s is divisible by 8. Let's check:\n\nExample0: sum of 8s is6, sum of 2s is8. Total 6*8 + 2*2 =48+16=64. 64 is divisible by8. Output0.\n\nExample1: sum8s is9*8=72, sum2s is6*2=12. Total 72+12=84. 84 divided by8 is 10.5. Not divisible. Output8. Hmm, Example0's total is64, which is divisible by8, output0. Example1's 84 is not, output8. Example2's total:\n\n8s:14*8=112. 2s:8*2=16. Total 128. 128/8=16. Divisible by8. Output is8. So this doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. Let's try to think of another approach. Maybe the output is the number that appears in the majority of the cells that are surrounded by the same number. For example, a cell that has the same number above, below, left, and right. But this would require checking each cell's neighbors, which is time-consuming but let's try for Example0.\n\nExample0's grid:\n\nRow0:0 0 8 0 8\n\nRow1:2 2 8 0 0\n\nRow2:2 2 0 0 8\n\nRow3:0 0 0 2 2\n\nRow4:8 8 0 2 2\n\nLooking for cells where all four adjacent cells are the same. For example, cell (0,2) is 8. Up is out of bounds, down is 8 (row1, column2). Left is0, right is0. Not the same. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the number that forms a cross shape in the grid. For example, a vertical and horizontal line intersecting.\n\nBut this is getting too vague. Perhaps I need to look for another pattern.\n\nWait, looking at the output examples, the output is [0] or [8]. So it's a single-element list. Maybe the output is the number that appears exactly once in the entire grid. Let's check:\n\nExample0: 0s appear multiple times. 8s also multiple times. 2s as well. So that's not.\n\nAlternatively, the output is the number that appears in the cell where the first occurrence of a 2 is followed by an 8. Not sure.\n\nLet's think of the numbers 0,2,8. Maybe the 2s are acting as separators or markers. For example, the output is 0 if the 2s form a closed loop, and 8 otherwise. But how?\n\nAlternatively, the output could be the number that is present in the grid's perimeter. For example, if the perimeter contains more 0s, output0. Let's check:\n\nExample0's perimeter. The perimeter includes the first and last rows, and the first and last columns.\n\nFirst row:0,0,8,0,8 \u2192 0,0,8,0,8.\n\nLast row:8,8,0,2,2.\n\nFirst column:0,2,2,0,8 \u2192 0,2,2,0,8.\n\nLast column:8,0,8,2,2 \u2192 8,0,8,2,2.\n\nPerimeter elements:\n\nCount of 0s in first and last rows and columns:\n\nFirst row:0,0,0,8 (elements 0,1,3,4) \u2192 0s:3.\n\nLast row:8,8,2,2 \u2192 8s:2, 2s:2.\n\nFirst column:0,2,2,0,8 \u2192 0s:2, 2s:2, 8:1.\n\nLast column:8,0,8,2,2 \u21928s:2, 0:1, 2s:2.\n\nTotal 0s in perimeter:3 (first row) +1 (last column) +0 (last row) +2 (first column) =6.\n\n8s:2 (first row) +2 (last row) +2 (last column) +1 (first column) =7.\n\n2s:2 (last row) +2 (last column) +2 (first column) =6.\n\nSo 0s:6, 8s:7. Output is0. Doesn't fit. So maybe not.\n\nAt this point, I'm stuck. Let me try to look for any other possible patterns.\n\nAnother observation: In all examples, the output is either 0 or 8, and the inputs contain 0, 2, and 8. Maybe 2 is a distraction, and the pattern involves only 0 and 8. For example, the output is the number (0 or8) that has a higher count in the grid when considering only 0 and 8. Let's check.\n\nExample0: 0s and 8s.\n\nRows:\n\nRow0: 0,0,8,0,8 \u2192 0s:3, 8s:2.\n\nRow1:2,2,8,0,0 \u2192 8s:1, 0s:2.\n\nRow2:2,2,0,0,8 \u21920s:3, 8:1.\n\nRow3:0,0,0,2,2 \u21920s:3.\n\nRow4:8,8,0,2,2 \u21928s:2, 0:1.\n\nTotal 0s:3+2+3+3+1=12.\n\n8s:2+1+1+0+2=6.\n\nSo 0s are more. Output is0. This fits.\n\nExample1: \n\nRow0:0,8,0,0,0,0,0 \u21920s:5, 8s:1.\n\nRow1:2,2,0,8,8,8,0 \u21920s:2, 8s:3.\n\nRow2:2,2,8,8,0,2,2 \u21928s:2, 0:1.\n\nRow3:0,0,8,0,0,2,2 \u21920s:4, 8:1.\n\nRow4:0,8,0,0,8,0,0 \u21920s:5, 8s:2.\n\nTotal 0s:5+2+1+4+5=17.\n\n8s:1+3+2+1+2=9.\n\n0s are more. Output is8. Doesn't fit. So this idea is invalid.\n\nHmm. So Example1's output is8 even though there are more 0s. So this pattern doesn't hold.\n\nWait, perhaps the output is determined by the number that appears in the majority of the cells that are not 2. For example, exclude 2s and count 0s and 8s.\n\nExample0: \n\nTotal cells not 2: each row:\n\nRow0:5 cells, all not 2.\n\nRow1:3 cells (8,0,0).\n\nRow2:3 cells (0,0,8).\n\nRow3:3 cells (0,0,0).\n\nRow4:3 cells (8,8,0).\n\nSo total non-2 cells:5+3+3+3+3=17.\n\nCount 0s and 8s:\n\n0s:3 (row0) +2 (row1) +3 (row2) +3 (row3) +1 (row4) =12.\n\n8s:2 (row0) +1 (row1) +1 (row2) +0 (row3) +2 (row4) =6.\n\nSo 0s are majority. Output0.\n\nExample1: non-2 cells:\n\nRow0:7 (all 0s and 8).\n\nRow1:5 cells (0,8,8,8,0).\n\nRow2:3 cells (8,8,0).\n\nRow3:5 cells (0,8,0,0,0).\n\nRow4:7 cells (0,8,0,0,8,0,0).\n\nTotal non-2 cells:7+5+3+5+7=27.\n\n0s:5 (row0) +2 (row1) +1 (row2) +4 (row3) +5 (row4) =17.\n\n8s:1 (row0) +3 (row1) +2 (row2) +1 (row3) +2 (row4) =9.\n\n0s are majority. Output is8. So this doesn't fit.\n\nSo the pattern isn't based on majority of 0s and 8s.\n\nAnother angle: Maybe the output is the number that appears in the same position in all rows where there's a 2 in the grid. For example, if a row has a 2, then the corresponding position in another row has an 8 or 0. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is 0 if the 2s form a certain pattern, like a rectangle, and 8 otherwise. But in Example0, the 2s are in pairs in multiple rows, forming vertical pairs. In Example1, the 2s are also in pairs, but output is8. So that doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. Let me think of the numbers 0 and8. 0 is a circle, 8 is two circles. Maybe the pattern relates to the number of enclosed areas in the grid. Like, the output is the number that corresponds to the number of enclosed loops. For example, 8 has two loops, 0 has one. So if the total number of loops is even or odd.\n\nBut how would this apply to the grid? Each 8 contributes two loops, each 0 contributes one. Let's try for Example0:\n\nNumber of 0s:12. 12 loops.\n\nNumber of 8s:6. 6*2=12 loops.\n\nTotal loops:24. Even. Output0.\n\nExample1:\n\n0s:17 loops.\n\n8s:9*2=18.\n\nTotal 17+18=35. Odd. Output8.\n\nExample2:\n\n0s: Let's count. Example2's input:\n\nRows:\n\nRow1:8,2,2,8,8,0,0 \u21920s:2.\n\nRow2:0,2,2,0,0,0,8 \u21920s:4.\n\nRow3:0,8,8,0,0,8,0 \u21920s:3.\n\nRow4:0,0,8,0,0,0,8 \u21920s:4.\n\nRow5:8,0,8,8,8,2,2 \u21920s:1.\n\nRow6:8,0,0,0,0,2,2 \u21920s:4.\n\nTotal 0s:2+4+3+4+1+4=18. 18 loops.\n\n8s:14. 14*2=28 loops.\n\nTotal:18+28=46. Even. Output8. Doesn't fit.\n\nSo this idea doesn't hold.\n\nAt this point, I'm really struggling. Let me look for another pattern. Maybe the output is the number (0 or8) that appears in the majority of the cells that are at the intersection of even-numbered rows and columns. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is determined by the number of times 0 and8 alternate in each row. For example, rows with alternating 0 and8 would influence the output. But I'm not sure.\n\nWait, another observation: In all the training examples, the output is [0] or [8], and the number in the output matches the number that appears in the last row's last element. Let's check:\n\nExample0's last row is [8,8,0,2,2], last element is2. Output is0. Doesn't fit.\n\nExample1's last row is [0,8,0,0,8,0,0]. Last element is0. Output is8. No.\n\nExample2's last row is [8,0,0,0,0,2,2]. Last element is2. Output is8. No.\n\nSo that's not it.\n\nAnother Idea: Maybe the output is determined by the number of 8s that are surrounded by 2s. For example, if an 8 is adjacent to two 2s in a row or column. Let's check Example1's output is8. Are there any 8s surrounded by 2s?\n\nIn Example1's third row: [2,2,8,8,0,2,2]. The 8s are between 2s and 0. Not surrounded by 2s. But output is8. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is 0 if the grid has an even number of 8s, and8 if odd. Example0 has6 8s \u2192 even \u2192 output0. Example1 has9 \u2192 odd \u2192 output8. Example2 has14 \u2192 even \u2192 output8. So that doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. Example2's output is8 despite even number of 8s. So that's invalid.\n\nWait, what if it's the number of 8s modulo 2? 6 mod2=0 \u2192 output0. 9 mod2=1 \u2192 output8. 14 mod2=0 \u2192 output8. No, doesn't fit.\n\nAt this point, I'm really stuck. Let's try to look for another possible pattern. Let's consider the positions of 2s in the grid and how they relate to 0s and8s. For example, maybe the 2s form a border around 0s or8s.\n\nIn Example0, the 2s are clustered in certain areas. For instance, rows1 and2 have 2s on the left, rows3 and4 have 2s on the right. Maybe the 0s are enclosed by 2s, leading to output0. But Example1's output is8, and the 2s are in clusters as well. Not sure.\n\nAnother Idea: Maybe the output is determined by the number of connected regions of 8s. For example, if the number of 8 regions is even, output0, else output8. But this requires identifying connected regions, which is time-consuming.\n\nAlternatively, the output is 0 if the grid is symmetric in some way, and8 otherwise. Let's check Example0's grid for symmetry:\n\nRow0:0,0,8,0,8.\n\nRow1:2,2,8,0,0.\n\nRow2:2,2,0,0,8.\n\nRow3:0,0,0,2,2.\n\nRow4:8,8,0,2,2.\n\nNo obvious symmetry. Example1's grid is also not symmetric. So that's not likely.\n\nI think I've exhausted most obvious possibilities. Maybe the key is to look for the number of times a certain pattern appears. For example, the presence of a 2 followed by another 2 and then an 8. Or a sequence of 8s and 0s.\n\nWait, looking at the test input now might help. The test input is:\n\n[2, 2, 8, 8, 0, 8]\n\n[2, 2, 0, 8, 0, 0]\n\n[8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8]\n\n[0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0]\n\n[8, 0, 8, 0, 0, 8]\n\n[0, 0, 8, 2, 2, 0]\n\n[8, 0, 0, 2, 2, 0]\n\n[0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8]\n\nThe output should be either [0] or [8]. Let's try to apply some of the patterns that partially worked.\n\nFor example, let's count the number of 8s and 2s:\n\nTest input:\n\nLet's count 8s and 2s in each row.\n\nRow1:2,2,8,8,0,8 \u2192 8s:3, 2s:2.\n\nRow2:2,2,0,8,0,0 \u21928s:1, 2s:2.\n\nRow3:8,8,0,0,0,8 \u21928s:3.\n\nRow4:0,8,8,8,0,0 \u21928s:3.\n\nRow5:8,0,8,0,0,8 \u21928s:3.\n\nRow6:0,0,8,2,2,0 \u21928s:1, 2s:2.\n\nRow7:8,0,0,2,2,0 \u21928s:1, 2s:2.\n\nRow8:0,8,0,0,0,8 \u21928s:2.\n\nTotal 8s:3+1+3+3+3+1+1+2=17.\n\n2s:2+2+0+0+0+2+2+0=8.\n\nSo 17 8s and 8 2s. Now, in previous examples:\n\nExample0: 6 8s, 8 2s \u2192 output0.\n\nExample3:14 8s, 8 2s \u2192 output0.\n\nExample5: output0. Let's check Example5's counts.\n\nExample5's input:\n\nRows:\n\nRow1:8,0,0,2,2,8 \u21928s:2, 2s:2.\n\nRow2:8,0,8,2,2,0 \u21928s:2, 2s:2.\n\nRow3:0,0,0,0,8,0 \u21928s:1.\n\nRow4:2,2,8,0,8,0 \u21928s:2, 2s:2.\n\nRow5:2,2,0,0,0,8 \u21922s:2.\n\nRow6:0,8,8,0,8,0 \u21928s:3.\n\nTotal 8s:2+2+1+2+0+3=10.\n\n2s:2+2+2+2=8.\n\nOutput is0. So when 2s count is8 and 8s count is10, output is0. In the test input, 8s=17, 2s=8. So according to Example0 and Example3, where 2s=8 and output is0, maybe the test output is0. But in Example2, 2s=8 and 8s=14, output is8. So this contradicts.\n\nSo the count of 2s being8 isn't sufficient.\n\nWait, maybe the output is0 if the number of 2s is exactly8, regardless of 8s. Let's check the training examples:\n\nExample0: 2s=8 \u2192 output0.\n\nExample3:2s=8 \u2192 output0.\n\nExample5:2s=8 \u2192 output0.\n\nExample2:2s=8 \u2192 output8. So no.\n\nSo this pattern is invalid.\n\nAlternative approach: Since the examples are confusing, perhaps the pattern is to look at the parity of the number of rows that have exactly two 2s. For example:\n\nExample0 has 4 rows with exactly two 2s. Even \u2192 output0.\n\nExample1 has3 such rows. Odd \u2192 output8.\n\nExample2 has4 rows with two 2s. Even \u2192 output8. Doesn't fit.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternatively, the number of rows starting with two 2s. Let's check:\n\nExample0 has rows1,2 starting with two 2s. Two rows. Even \u2192 output0.\n\nExample1 has rows1,2,3 starting with two 2s. Three rows. Odd \u2192 output8.\n\nExample2 has rows1,2,5,6 with two 2s. Four rows. Even \u2192 output8. Doesn't fit.\n\nThis doesn't hold.\n\nPerhaps the output is determined by the number of times 8 appears in the same position across all rows. For example, if a column has more 8s than 0s, then output8.\n\nFor the test input, each column:\n\nThe test input has 8 rows and 6 columns. Let's check each column.\n\nColumn0:\n\nRow1:2\n\nRow2:2\n\nRow3:8\n\nRow4:0\n\nRow5:8\n\nRow6:0\n\nRow7:8\n\nRow8:0\n\nSo values:2,2,8,0,8,0,8,0. Count of 8s:3.\n\nColumn1:\n\nRow1:2\n\nRow2:2\n\nRow3:8\n\nRow4:8\n\nRow5:0\n\nRow6:0\n\nRow7:0\n\nRow8:8\n\nValues:2,2,8,8,0,0,0,8. Count of 8s:4.\n\nColumn2:\n\nRow1:8\n\nRow2:0\n\nRow3:0\n\nRow4:8\n\nRow5:8\n\nRow6:8\n\nRow7:0\n\nRow8:0\n\nValues:8,0,0,8,8,8,0,0. Count of8s:4.\n\nColumn3:\n\nRow1:8\n\nRow2:8\n\nRow3:0\n\nRow4:8\n\nRow5:0\n\nRow6:2\n\nRow7:2\n\nRow8:0\n\nValues:8,8,0,8,0,2,2,0. Count of8s:3.\n\nColumn4:\n\nRow1:0\n\nRow2:0\n\nRow3:0\n\nRow4:0\n\nRow5:0\n\nRow6:2\n\nRow7:2\n\nRow8:0\n\nValues:0,0,0,0,0,2,2,0. Count of8s:0.\n\nColumn5:\n\nRow1:8\n\nRow2:0\n\nRow3:8\n\nRow4:0\n\nRow5:8\n\nRow6:0\n\nRow7:0\n\nRow8:8\n\nValues:8,0,8,0,8,0,0,8. Count of8s:4.\n\nSo columns have varying counts of 8s. The majority of columns (columns1,2,5) have more 8s. So perhaps the output is8. But this is just a guess.\n\nAnother Idea: Let's go back to the initial examples and see if there's a pattern based on the arrangement of 2s and 8s.\n\nIn Example0, the output is0. Looking at the grid:\n\nThe 2s are arranged in pairs on the left and right sides. The 8s are scattered. Perhaps the 2s form a sort of enclosure, leading to output0.\n\nIn Example1, the output is8. The 2s are arranged in pairs in rows, but the 8s are clustered in the middle. Maybe the 8s are forming a loop.\n\nAlternatively, the output is0 if there's an even number of 8s surrounded by 2s, and8 if odd. But without knowing how to count that, it's hard.\n\nAnother possible pattern: The output is0 if the number of 8s is even and the number of 2s is even, or some combination. Example0: 8s=6 (even), 2s=8 (even) \u2192 output0. Example1:8s=9 (odd), 2s=6 (even) \u2192 output8. Example2:8s=14 (even), 2s=8 (even) \u2192 output8. Example3:8s=14 (even), 2s=8 (even) \u2192 output0. Example4: Let's check. Example4's output is8. Counts:\n\nExample4's input:\n\nRow1:8,0,0,0,0,8,0 \u21928s:2.\n\nRow2:0,0,2,2,0,8,0 \u21928s:1.\n\nRow3:8,0,2,2,0,0,0 \u21928s:1.\n\nRow4:0,0,8,0,0,8,0 \u21928s:2.\n\nRow5:0,0,8,2,2,0,8 \u21928s:2.\n\nRow6:8,0,0,2,2,8,0 \u21928s:2.\n\nTotal 8s:2+1+1+2+2+2=10 (even).\n\n2s:4 (rows2,3,5,6). 4 even.\n\nOutput is8. So even and even, output8. This breaks the previous pattern. So this idea is invalid.\n\nAt this point, I'm really stuck. Given the time I've spent and the need to provide an answer, I'll have to make an educated guess based on some patterns that partially fit.\n\nLooking at the test input's 2s count is8, and in the training examples:\n\nExample0,3,5: 2s=8, output0.\n\nExample2:2s=8, output8.\n\nSo it's inconsistent. But maybe there's another factor. Let's check the number of 8s in those examples:\n\nExample0:6 \u2192 output0.\n\nExample3:14 \u2192 output0.\n\nExample5:10 \u2192 output0.\n\nExample2:14 \u2192 output8.\n\nHmm. So when 2s=8 and 8s even:\n\nExample0: even \u21920.\n\nExample2: even \u21928.\n\nExample3: even \u21920.\n\nExample5: even \u21920.\n\nSo no clear pattern.\n\nAlternatively, the test input has 8s=17, which is odd. In training examples where 8s are odd:\n\nExample1:9 \u21928.\n\nExample4:10 \u2192 even \u2192 output8. Wait, no. Example4's 8s=10 even, output8.\n\nExample5:8s=10 even \u2192 output0.\n\nSo no.\n\nPerhaps the output is0 if the sum of 8s and 2s is even, else8.\n\nTest input: 17 (8s) +8 (2s) =25 \u2192 odd \u2192 output8.\n\nExample0:6+8=14 \u2192 even \u21920.\n\nExample1:9+6=15 \u2192 odd \u21928.\n\nExample2:14+8=22 \u2192 even \u21928. Doesn't fit.\n\nExample3:14+8=22 \u2192 even \u21920.\n\nExample4:10+8=18 \u2192 even \u21928.\n\nExample5:10+8=18 \u2192 even \u21920.\n\nSo in Example2 and4, sum even \u2192 output8. So this pattern doesn't hold.\n\nBut for the test input, sum is25 \u2192 odd \u2192 output8.\n\nBut this is just a guess. Alternatively, the sum of 8s and 2s mod8:\n\nTest sum25 mod8=1. Output could be0 if 1 maps to something. Not sure.\n\nAnother Idea: Maybe the output is0 if the number of 8s is even and the number of 2s is even, and8 otherwise.\n\nExample0: even and even \u21920.\n\nExample1: odd and even \u21928.\n\nExample2: even and even \u21928. Doesn't fit.\n\nExample3: even and even \u21920.\n\nExample4: even and even \u21928.\n\nExample5: even and even \u21920.\n\nSo this pattern doesn't fit.\n\nBut test input has even 2s and odd 8s \u2192 even and odd \u21928.\n\nExample1: odd and even \u21928.\n\nSo maybe the output is8 when 8s are odd, regardless of 2s. Let's check:\n\nExample0:8s even \u21920.\n\nExample1:8s odd \u21928.\n\nExample2:8s even \u21928. Doesn't fit.\n\nExample3:8s even \u21920.\n\nExample4:8s even \u21928.\n\nExample5:8s even \u21920.\n\nSo in examples where 8s are even, output can be 0 or8. Thus, this idea is invalid.\n\nAt this point, I'll have to make a best guess based on the examples where 2s=8 and output is0. In the test input, 2s=8, but 8s=17 (odd). Looking back at Example5, which has 2s=8 and 8s=10 (even) \u2192 output0. Example3:2s=8, 8s=14 (even) \u21920. Example0:2s=8, 8s=6 \u2192 even \u21920. Example2:2s=8, 8s=14 (even) \u2192 output8. So there's inconsistency. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps when 2s=8, output0 unless there's a certain condition. But I can't discern the condition.\n\nGiven that the majority of examples with 2s=8 have output0 (3 out of 4), but one has output8. But without further information, I'll tentatively guess that the output is0. However, looking at the test input's 8s are17, which is odd. Maybe the pattern is output0 when 2s=8 and 8s even, output8 when 2s=8 and 8s odd. So for test input, 8s=17 (odd), output8.\n\nBut how to confirm this.\n\nIn training examples:\n\nExample0: 8s=6 even \u21920.\n\nExample3:8s=14 even \u21920.\n\nExample5:8s=10 even \u21920.\n\nExample2:8s=14 even \u21928. Doesn't fit.\n\nSo this pattern doesn't hold. Hence, I'm stuck.\n\nGiven the time I've spent, I'll have to make a guess. Based on the test input's high number of 8s and the fact that in Example2 and4, high 8s counts resulted in output8, I'll guess the output is8."

        "cot_1": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. So, looking at the training examples, each input is a list of lists (rows of numbers), and the output is a single-element list with either 0 or 8. My job is to find out what determines the output.\n\nLet me start by looking at the examples one by one.\n\nExample 0:\nInput has several rows. The output is [0]. Let me note the numbers. There are 0s, 8s, and 2s. Maybe it's about the arrangement of these numbers. Hmm. Maybe looking for a specific pattern in the rows or columns.\n\nExample 1:\nOutput is [8]. The rows here have 8s and 2s as well. Maybe counting occurrences of certain numbers? Let's count. In example 0's input, how many 8s are there? Let's see: first row has two 8s, second has one, third has one, fourth none, fifth two. Total 6? Not sure. The output is 0 here. Example1's output is 8. Maybe it's about which number appears more in a certain position.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the numbers 2 and 8 form some kind of pairs. Like, maybe 2s are in pairs (like adjacent 2s), and 8s are around them. Let's check. For example, in example0's input rows, there are rows with [2,2], so pairs of 2s. Then maybe the output is determined by the number of such pairs? Or maybe the 8s and 2s form some sort of balance.\n\nWait, looking at the outputs, example0 output is 0, example1 is 8. Maybe the output is the number (0 or 8) that forms a closed loop or something. But how?\n\nAnother angle: maybe the pattern relates to the number of times a certain number appears in the borders versus the center. Or perhaps the arrangement of 2s and 8s in the grid.\n\nWait, another thought. The numbers 2 and 8 might represent directions. Like 8 could be up and down, 2 could be left and right. Maybe the pattern involves movement or paths. But I'm not sure.\n\nLooking at example0's input:\n\nRows:\n[0,0,8,0,8]\n[2,2,8,0,0]\n[2,2,0,0,8]\n[0,0,0,2,2]\n[8,8,0,2,2]\n\nLooking for a pattern here. Maybe the output is determined by the sum or parity. But example0's output is 0. Let's see sum: Not sure.\n\nWait, maybe the output is the value that is surrounded in a particular way. For example, maybe looking for a cell that is surrounded by the other number. Like, 0 surrounded by 8s or vice versa. But I need to check.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's the count of certain shapes. For instance, 2s appearing in pairs (like two 2s next to each other) and 8s in certain positions. Let's see in example0: the first row has 8s at positions 3 and 5. Then the next rows have 2,2. Maybe the output is determined by the presence of certain groups.\n\nAnother approach: the output is the number (0 or 8) that is in the center of a symmetric pattern. For example, if the entire grid is symmetric in some way, the center would be the output. But looking at example0's input, maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, think of each row as a binary representation, but the numbers are 0, 2, 8. Maybe converting them to binary? 0 is 0, 2 is 10, 8 is 1000. Not sure how that would help.\n\nWait, let's consider the 2 and 8 as parts of a binary-like code. Maybe the 2s and 8s form a binary number, and their sum modulo something gives the output. But in example0, the output is 0. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is about the number of islands formed by 8s or 2s. Like in a grid, islands are connected cells. But then the output would be the count, but the outputs here are 0 or 8. So maybe not.\n\nAnother angle: in each input, the output is the number (0 or 8) that is in a position that's part of a majority in some way. For instance, if more rows start with 8, output is 8. Let's check example0: the rows start with 0,2,2,0,8. So starting numbers are mostly 0 and 2. Output is 0. Not sure.\n\nWait, looking at the first example:\n\nInput rows for example1:\n\n[0,8,0,0,0,0,0]\n[2,2,0,8,8,8,0]\n[2,2,8,8,0,2,2]\n[0,0,8,0,0,2,2]\n[0,8,0,0,8,0,0]\n\nOutput is [8]. How is 8 chosen here?\n\nMaybe the output is the number that appears in the exact center of the grid. Let's check the dimensions. For example0, the input is 5 rows, each of 5 elements. So the center would be row 3 (index 2), column 3 (index 2). Let's see: in example0's third row is [2,2,0,0,8]. The center element is 0, but output is 0. So maybe that's a coincidence. Example1 has 5 rows of 7 elements each. The center would be row 3 (index 2), column 3 (index 3). The third row is [2,2,8,8,0,2,2]. The center element here is 8 (third element of the row). Output is 8. That matches. Let's check other examples.\n\nExample2's input has 6 rows of 7 elements each. The center would be between rows 3 and 4, but maybe considering even rows. Alternatively, perhaps the middle element in the entire grid when flattened. But maybe for even dimensions, the center is not a single cell. Alternatively, maybe for each example, the output is the number at a specific position. Let me check.\n\nExample3's output is 0. The input has 6 rows of 7 elements. Let's see the center. If rows are 6, then middle rows are 3 and 4 (indices 2 and 3). For columns, 7 elements, middle column is index 3. So check row 2, column 3: third row is [0,0,0,8,0,8,0], so index3 is 8. Row3, column3: fourth row is [8,0,0,0,0,0,0], column3 is 0. So maybe taking the average or something. Output is 0, which is present here.\n\nBut this is getting a bit inconsistent. Let's test another example.\n\nExample4's output is 8. The input has 6 rows of 7 elements. Middle rows would be 3 and 4 (indices 2 and 3). Middle columns are 3 and 4. Let's check row3 (index3) is [0,0,8,0,0,8,0]. Middle column 3 (element 0) and 4 (element0). Hmm. Not sure. Output is 8 here. Maybe this approach is wrong.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is determined by the parity of the number of 2s and 8s. For example0: counting 8s. Let's see. In example0's input:\n\nRow1: two 8s\nRow2: one 8\nRow3: one 8\nRow4: zero\nRow5: two 8s\nTotal 8s: 2+1+1+0+2 =6. Output is 0. Hmm.\n\nIn example1, total 8s: let's count.\n\nRow1: one 8\nRow2: three 8s\nRow3: two 8s\nRow4: one 8\nRow5: two 8s\nTotal: 1+3+2+1+2=9. Output is 8. But 9 is odd. Maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the number that appears in the first and last positions. For example0's first row starts with 0 and ends with 8. The last row starts with 8 and ends with 2. Not sure. The output is 0. Not directly obvious.\n\nAnother idea: Maybe the output is 0 if the sum of all elements is even, and 8 if odd. Let's check.\n\nExample0: sum of all elements. Let's compute:\n\nRow1: 0+0+8+0+8=16\nRow2: 2+2+8+0+0=12\nRow3:2+2+0+0+8=12\nRow4:0+0+0+2+2=4\nRow5:8+8+0+2+2=20\nTotal sum:16+12+12+4+20=64. 64 is even. Output is 0. That fits.\n\nExample1: sum of all elements.\n\nRow1:0+8+0+0+0+0+0=8\nRow2:2+2+0+8+8+8+0=28\nRow3:2+2+8+8+0+2+2=24\nRow4:0+0+8+0+0+2+2=12\nRow5:0+8+0+0+8+0+0=16\nTotal sum:8+28=36, +24=60, +12=72, +16=88. 88 is even. Output is 8. But 88 is even, but output is 8. So this contradicts the idea. So sum parity may not be the pattern.\n\nHmm. So that idea is invalid.\n\nAlternative approach: maybe the output is the value that is present in the majority of the corners. Let's check.\n\nExample0's corners: first row's first and last elements (0 and8), last row's first and last (8 and2). So corners are 0,8,8,2. 0 occurs once, 8 twice, 2 once. Majority is 8. But output is 0. So no.\n\nAnother thought: maybe the output is the number that is present in all four corners. But in example0, the four corners are 0 (top-left),8 (top-right),8 (bottom-left),2 (bottom-right). No common number. So output is 0. Hmm, maybe not.\n\nWait, maybe the output is determined by the number (0 or8) that forms a certain pattern when considering the positions of 2s. For example, 2s are arranged in pairs (adjacent 2s), and the output depends on how they are positioned relative to 8s.\n\nLooking at example0, there are multiple rows with [2,2], like rows 2,3,4,5. The output is 0. Maybe the number of 2-pairs is even, leading to output 0. Let's count the number of adjacent 2s. In example0:\n\nRow2: starts with 2,2 \u2192 one pair.\nRow3: 2,2 \u2192 another pair.\nRow4: ends with 2,2 \u2192 another pair.\nRow5: ends with 2,2 \u2192 another pair. Total 4 pairs. 4 is even. Output is 0.\n\nExample1: output 8. Let's count 2-pairs.\n\nRow2: starts with 2,2 \u2192 one.\nRow3: starts with 2,2 and ends with 2,2 \u2192 two pairs.\nRow4: ends with 2,2 \u2192 one.\nTotal 1+2+1=4 pairs. Even, but output is 8. So that's conflicting. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the count of 2-pairs is compared to the count of 8-pairs. But example0 has 4 2-pairs and 8-pairs (like in row1: 8,0,8 \u2192 two 8s but not adjacent. So maybe not.\n\nAnother angle: The output is 0 if the number of 2-pairs is even, and 8 if odd. Example0:4 pairs \u2192 even \u2192 output 0. Example1:4 pairs \u2192 even \u2192 output should be 0, but actual output is8. So no.\n\nAlternative idea: maybe the output is the number (0 or8) that is in the same position as the start or end of a 2-pair. For example, in example0's rows with 2-pairs, maybe the next or previous element is considered. But I'm not seeing it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is the number that is present in the majority of the cells adjacent to the 2-pairs. For example, in example0's row2: [2,2,8,0,0], the 2-pair is followed by 8. So 8 is adjacent. Then in row3: [2,2,0,0,8], the 2-pair is followed by 0. So adjacent 0. Row4's 2-pair is preceded by 0. Row5's 2-pair is preceded by 2,2 \u2192 preceded by 0 (row5: [8,8,0,2,2], the 2-pair is after 0). So adjacent numbers vary. So maybe the majority is 0 adjacent to 2-pairs, leading to output 0. But in example1's output is8, but how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is determined by the number that is diagonally adjacent to the 2-pairs. But this seems complicated.\n\nWait, perhaps the output is the number that is in the same row as the majority of 2-pairs. For example, in example0, each row with a 2-pair (rows2,3,4,5) have 2-pairs. The output is 0, which may be the number present in those rows. For example, row2 has 8, row3 has 0 and 8, row4 has 0, row5 has 8. Not sure.\n\nAnother approach: let's look for the output being the number that is not part of any 2-pair. Wait, 0 and8 are the outputs, so maybe when the 2-pairs form a certain shape, the output is 0, else 8. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the number that appears in the same row and column as the first or last occurrence of a 2-pair. But this seems too vague.\n\nWait, let's think of the 2s as forming horizontal lines. For example, in example0, the 2-pairs are all horizontal. Maybe the output is determined by the presence of vertical 2-pairs. But in example0, no vertical pairs. So output 0.\n\nExample1 has 2-pairs in row2 and row3. Also, in row3, there's a 2-pair at the end. So maybe vertical pairs? Let's check columns. Maybe 2s in the same column. For example0, column0: 0,2,2,0,8. So two 2s in column0, rows2 and3. But they are adjacent. So vertical pair. Example0 has vertical 2-pairs. Output is 0. Hmm, maybe the output is 0 when there are vertical 2-pairs and 8 otherwise. But example1: checking for vertical 2-pairs. Let's see columns. In example1's input:\n\nRows:\n\nRow0: [0,8,0,0,0,0,0]\nRow1: [2,2,0,8,8,8,0]\nRow2: [2,2,8,8,0,2,2]\nRow3: [0,0,8,0,0,2,2]\nRow4: [0,8,0,0,8,0,0]\n\nLooking for vertical 2-pairs. Column0: 0,2,2,0,0. So rows1 and2 have 2s. So vertical 2-pair. Similarly, column1:8,2,2,0,8. Row1 and row2 have 2s. So vertical pairs. So example1 has vertical 2-pairs, but output is8. So previous idea is invalid.\n\nHmm, this is tricky. Maybe I should look for another pattern.\n\nWait, perhaps the output is the number that appears in the same position as the center of the grid when considering all 2-pairs. For example, the center cell of the entire grid. Let me check.\n\nExample0's grid is 5x5. Center is (2,2). The third row, third element is 0. Output is0. That matches.\n\nExample1's grid is 5x7. The center would be (2,3) (third row, fourth column). The third row is [2,2,8,8,0,2,2], so element at index3 is8. Output is8. That matches.\n\nExample2's grid is 6 rows of7 elements. The center would be between rows 2 and3. Maybe taking the center of the entire grid. For 6 rows, the middle is between rows3 and4. Let's see. For example2's output is8. Let's check the center. If we take the middle element when all rows are laid out, perhaps. 6 rows *7=42 elements. Middle is at 21st element. Let's count:\n\nRow0:7 elements (0-6)\nRow1:7 (7-13)\nRow2:7 (14-20)\nRow3:7 (21-27) \u2192 21st element is row3, first element. Row3 is [0,0,8,0,0,0,8]. First element is0. But output is8. So that doesn't match.\n\nHmm, maybe the pattern is that the output is the center element of the grid. For example0, 5x5, center is (2,2) which is0, output0. Example1,5x7, center (2,3) which is8, output8. Example3:6x7 grid. The center might be row3, column3. Row3 is [8,0,0,0,0,0,0], column3 is0. Output is0. Which matches. Example4:6 rows of7, output8. Let's see center. Row3 is [0,0,8,0,0,8,0]. Column3 is0. Output is8. So that's a contradiction. So that idea is invalid.\n\nWait, example4's output is8. If center element is0, but output is8. So no. So maybe the pattern is not about the center element.\n\nAlternative approach: maybe the output is determined by the parity of the number of 8s surrounding the 2-pairs. For example, in example0, the 2-pairs have adjacent 8s. Let's count.\n\nExample0's rows with 2-pairs:\n\nRow2: [2,2,8,0,0] \u2192 after the 2-pair is an8. So one 8 adjacent.\n\nRow3: [2,2,0,0,8] \u2192 after 2-pair is0. So no 8.\n\nRow4: [0,0,0,2,2] \u2192 before 2-pair is0. No 8.\n\nRow5: [8,8,0,2,2] \u2192 before 2-pair is0. No 8.\n\nTotal adjacent 8s for 2-pairs:1. Which is odd. Output is0. Example1's 2-pairs:\n\nRow1: [2,2,0,8,8,8,0] \u2192 after 2-pair is0. Before is nothing. Adjacent to 8? The 0 is followed by8, so perhaps the 8 is next to the 2-pair. So maybe one 8 adjacent.\n\nRow2: [2,2,8,8,0,2,2] \u2192 after 2-pair is8. So adjacent 8.\n\nRow3: [0,0,8,0,0,2,2] \u2192 after 2-pair is nothing (end of row). Before 2-pair is0.\n\nRow4: [0,8,0,0,8,0,0] \u2192 no 2-pairs.\n\nSo in example1, the adjacent 8s to 2-pairs are in row1 (after 2-pair is0, but followed by8?), maybe. Or row2's 2-pair is followed by8. So total adjacent 8s to 2-pairs is2. Even. Output is8. But example0's output was0 with 1 (odd). Hmm. Maybe not.\n\nThis is getting too complicated. Let me try a different approach.\n\nLooking at the training examples, each output is either 0 or8. Maybe it's the number that appears in the majority of the positions where rows and columns intersect in a certain way. For example, the intersection of the middle row and middle column.\n\nExample0: middle row is row2 (third row): [2,2,0,0,8]. Middle column is column2 (third element). The value here is0. Output is0. That matches.\n\nExample1: middle row is row2 (third row): [2,2,8,8,0,2,2]. Middle column of 7 elements is column3 (fourth element). The value here is8. Output is8. Matches.\n\nExample2: input has6 rows. Middle rows are3 and4. For 6 rows, perhaps average. Middle columns for7 elements is column3. So check rows3 and4, column3. Row3: [0,0,8,0,0,0,8], column3 is0. Row4: [8,0,8,8,8,2,2], column3 is8. So average of 0 and8? Not sure. Output is8. Maybe take the maximum. So8 is present, output is8. That matches.\n\nExample3:6 rows, 7 columns. Middle rows are3 and4. Row3: [8,0,0,0,0,0,0], column3 is0. Row4: [0,2,2,0,8,0,8], column3 is0. So average is0. Output is0. Matches.\n\nExample4:6 rows,7 columns. Middle rows3 and4. Row3: [0,0,8,0,0,8,0], column3 is0. Row4: [0,0,8,2,2,0,8], column3 is2. Hmm. Output is8. So previous pattern doesn't apply here. Because middle elements are0 and2, but output is8. So this breaks the idea.\n\nHmm, example4's output is8, but according to this method, it would be 0 or2. So perhaps the pattern is different.\n\nWait, example4's output is8. Let me check the rows and columns again. Maybe it's the middle of the entire grid when flattened. 6 rows of7 is42 elements. Middle positions would be 21 and22. The 21st element is row3's first element (0-based index: row0:7, row1:14, row2:21, so row3's first element is index21. Which is0. The 22nd is row3's second element (0). So output would be0, but actual output is8. So no.\n\nAlternative approach: the output is the value that appears in the majority of the central cross (the middle row and middle column). For example, in example0: middle row is row2, which contains 0 in the middle. Middle column (column2) has 8, 8,0,0,0. So majority in the cross is0. Output0.\n\nExample1: middle row (row2) has8 in the middle. Middle column (column3) has8. So output8.\n\nExample2: middle rows3 and4. Middle column3. Row3's column3 is0. Row4's column3 is8. So majority is0 and8. Output8. So maybe if there's a tie, it chooses8? Not sure.\n\nExample3: middle rows3 and4. Row3's column3 is0. Row4's column3 is0. Middle column3 has0 in both. Output0.\n\nExample4: middle rows3 and4. Row3's column3 is0. Row4's column3 is2. So majority is0 and2. Output is8. Doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. So this pattern works for examples0-3, but not for example4. So perhaps there's another layer to the pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the number that appears at the intersection of the first row that contains a 2-pair and the first column that contains a 2-pair. Let's check.\n\nExample0: first row with 2-pair is row1 (index1). Columns: first column with 2-pair is column0 (rows1 and2 have 2s). So intersection is row1, column0: 2. But output is0. So no.\n\nAlternative idea: the output is determined by the presence of a certain shape made by 8s. For example, if the 8s form a closed loop, output is0 or8. But how to check that.\n\nAlternatively, think of the grid as a binary matrix where 8s are 1 and others are 0. Then look for certain features. But the presence of 2s complicates this.\n\nAlternatively, think of 8s as obstacles and 2s as paths. But again, not sure.\n\nWait, looking back at the test input. Let's see if applying the previous pattern (middle row and column) would work here.\n\nTest input:\n\n8 rows, each of6 elements.\n\nMiddle rows are rows3 and4 (indices3 and4). Middle columns for6 elements are columns2 and3.\n\nCheck rows3 and4, columns2 and3.\n\nRow3: [0,8,0,0,0,8]. Columns2 and3:0 and0.\n\nRow4: [0,0,0,8,0,0]. Columns2 and3:0 and8.\n\nSo elements in the center area: 0,0,0,8. The majority is0. But the output could be0.\n\nBut according to the training examples, example5's input is 6 rows of6 elements. Output is0. Let's check that.\n\nExample5's input has6 rows. Middle rows3 and2. Columns3 and2. Let's see.\n\nRow3: [2,2,8,0,8,0]. Columns2 and3:8 and0.\n\nRow4: [2,2,0,0,0,8]. Columns2 and3:0 and0.\n\nMiddle elements:8,0,0,0. Majority is0. Output is0. Which matches.\n\nSo for the test input, the center elements are mostly0. So output would be0. But the training examples like example4 have output8 even when the center elements are0 and2. Hmm. So this is conflicting.\n\nWait, example4's test case may have a different pattern. Let's see.\n\nExample4's input:\n\nRows:\n\n[8,0,0,0,0,8,0]\n[0,0,2,2,0,8,0]\n[8,0,2,2,0,0,0]\n[0,0,8,0,0,8,0]\n[0,0,8,2,2,0,8]\n[8,0,0,2,2,8,0]\n\nMiddle rows3 and4. Columns3 and4.\n\nRow3: [0,0,8,0,0,8,0]. Columns3:0, columns4:0.\n\nRow4: [0,0,8,2,2,0,8]. Columns3:2, columns4:2.\n\nSo elements at the center cross:0,0,2,2. Majority is0 and2. Output is8. So this pattern doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. This is really challenging. Let's think of another pattern.\n\nAnother observation: the outputs alternate between 0 and8. Let's see:\n\nExample0:0\n\nExample1:8\n\nExample2:8 (same as previous)\n\nNo, that breaks. Example3:0, example4:8, example5:0. So it's 0,8,8,0,8,0. Not an alternating pattern.\n\nWait, perhaps the output is determined by the number of 2-pairs. For example:\n\nExample0:4 pairs \u2192 even \u21920.\n\nExample1:4 pairs \u2192 even \u2192 but output is8. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAnother idea: the output is the number that appears in the same row as the first occurrence of a 2-pair. Let's check.\n\nExample0: first 2-pair is row1 (index1) [2,2,8,0,0]. The row has an8. Output is0. Not matching.\n\nAlternatively, the number following the first 2-pair. Example0's first 2-pair is followed by8. Output is0. Doesn't match.\n\nAlternatively, the output is the number that is not present in the same row as any 2-pair. But in example0, all rows with 2-pairs have 0 and8. So output is0. Maybe.\n\nExample1's output is8. Rows with 2-pairs have 0,8, etc. So not sure.\n\nThis is getting frustrating. Let me try to look for another pattern.\n\nWait, looking at the test input:\n\nTest input rows:\n\n[0,8,0,0,0,0]\n[0,0,0,8,2,2]\n[0,8,8,8,2,2]\n[0,8,0,0,0,8]\n[0,0,0,8,0,0]\n[8,2,2,0,0,8]\n[0,2,2,0,0,0]\n[0,8,0,8,8,0]\n\nLet me count the number of 2-pairs. Looking for consecutive 2s.\n\nRow1: [0,0,0,8,2,2] \u2192 2-pair at end.\n\nRow2: [0,8,8,8,2,2] \u2192 2-pair at end.\n\nRow5: [8,2,2,0,0,8] \u2192 2-pair at positions1-2.\n\nRow6: [0,2,2,0,0,0] \u2192 2-pair at positions1-2.\n\nRow7: no 2-pairs.\n\nSo total 4 2-pairs. Even number. According to example0, even 2-pairs \u2192 output0. Example1 had4 2-pairs but output8. So this doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. But in the test input, maybe the center is row4 (since 8 rows). Middle rows are4 and5 (indices3 and4). Let's see row3 and4.\n\nRow3: [0,8,0,0,0,8]\nRow4: [0,0,0,8,0,0]\n\nMiddle columns for6 elements are columns3 and4 (indexes2 and3).\n\nRow3's columns3 and4:0 and0.\n\nRow4's columns3 and4:8 and0.\n\nSo elements at center cross:0,0,8,0. Majority is0. So output would be0.\n\nLooking at the training examples, example5's test case:\n\nInput has6 rows of6 elements. Middle rows3 and4. Middle columns3 and2. Let's see.\n\nRow3: [2,2,8,0,8,0]. Columns3 and2:0 and8.\n\nRow4: [2,2,0,0,0,8]. Columns3 and2:0 and0.\n\nElements:0,8,0,0. Majority 0. Output0.\n\nSo the pattern seems to hold for example5.\n\nBut example4's test case had a different outcome, but perhaps there's another rule. Let's look at example4's input again.\n\nExample4's input:\n\nRows:\n\n[8,0,0,0,0,8,0]\n[0,0,2,2,0,8,0]\n[8,0,2,2,0,0,0]\n[0,0,8,0,0,8,0]\n[0,0,8,2,2,0,8]\n[8,0,0,2,2,8,0]\n\nMiddle rows3 and4 (since 6 rows). Columns3 and4 (7 elements, so columns3 and4 are indexes3 and4).\n\nRow3: [0,0,8,0,0,8,0] \u2192 columns3:0, column4:0.\n\nRow4: [0,0,8,2,2,0,8] \u2192 columns3:2, column4:2.\n\nSo elements at center cross:0,0,2,2. Majority is0 and2. But output is8. So how does this fit?\n\nHmm. Maybe the pattern is that the output is the number (0 or8) that is present in the majority of the central four elements (rows3 and4, columns3 and4). In example4's case, the central four elements are0,0,2,2. Neither 0 nor8 is majority. But output is8. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is the sum of the central four elements modulo something. But sum of 0+0+2+2=4. 4 mod 8 is4, which doesn't match output8.\n\nAlternative idea: the output is determined by the presence of a 8 in the central cross (middle rows and columns). For example4, central cross includes 0,0,2,2. No 8. Output is8. So that doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. This is getting me stuck. Let me think of the test case.\n\nTest input has 8 rows of6 elements. Middle rows are4 and5 (indices3 and4 are the 4th and5th rows in zero-based indexing?). Wait, rows are 0-7. Middle rows are 3.5, so rows3 and4. Let me check:\n\nRow3: [0,8,0,0,0,8]\n\nRow4: [0,0,0,8,0,0]\n\nColumns are6 elements, middle columns are3 and4 (indexes2 and3). So elements:\n\nRow3, column2:0\n\nRow3, column3:0\n\nRow4, column2:0\n\nRow4, column3:8\n\nSo elements are0,0,0,8. Majority is0. So output would be0.\n\nAccording to the training examples, this would fit examples0,1,2,3,5, but example4 is an exception. But maybe example4's output is due to another reason.\n\nLooking back at example4:\n\nOutput is8. The center cross elements are0,0,2,2. So neither 0 nor8. Maybe the pattern is that if the central elements are mixed, the output is the number that appears in the majority of the entire grid.\n\nExample4: count of 0,8, and2.\n\nLet's count:\n\nRow0:8,0,0,0,0,8,0 \u2192 0s:5, 8s:2.\n\nRow1:0,0,2,2,0,8,0 \u2192 0s:4, 2s:2,8:1.\n\nRow2:8,0,2,2,0,0,0 \u21920s:4, 2s:2,8:1.\n\nRow3:0,0,8,0,0,8,0 \u21920s:5,8s:2.\n\nRow4:0,0,8,2,2,0,8 \u21920s:3,8s:2, 2s:2.\n\nRow5:8,0,0,2,2,8,0 \u21920s:3,8s:2,2s:2.\n\nTotal 0s:5+4+4+5+3+3=24.\n\n8s:2+1+1+2+2+2=10.\n\n2s:2+2+2+2=8.\n\nSo majority is0. Output is8. So that doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. This is really challenging. Let me think of another angle.\n\nMaybe the output is the number that appears in the majority of the first and last elements of each row. Let's check example0:\n\nFirst elements:0,2,2,0,8 \u2192 0,2,2,0,8. Majority is0 (two occurrences) and 2 (two). Last elements:8,0,8,2,2 \u21928:2,0:1, 2:2. No clear majority. Output is0. Maybe the first elements' majority is0. Which matches.\n\nExample1:\n\nFirst elements:0,2,2,0,0 \u2192 majority 0 (3 times). Output is8. Doesn't match.\n\nSo that's invalid.\n\nAlternative idea: the output is the number that is present in the majority of the diagonal elements. Let's check example0:\n\n5x5 grid. Diagonals:\n\nMain diagonal (0,0),(1,1),(2,2),(3,3),(4,4). Values:0,2,0,2,2. Values are 0,2,0,2,2. Majority is2.\n\nAnti-diagonal: (0,4),(1,3),(2,2),(3,1),(4,0). Values:8,0,0,0,8. Values:8,0,0,0,8. Majority is0 and8 (two each). So output is0. Not matching the diagonal's majority.\n\nHmm. Not helpful.\n\nAnother approach: Perhaps the output is the number that is present in the majority of the corners of the grid. For example0's corners are0 (top-left),8 (top-right),8 (bottom-left),2 (bottom-right). 0 and8 each appear twice. Output is0. Example1's corners:0,0,0,0. Output is8. Doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the sum of the corners modulo something. Example0:0+8+8+2=18. 18 mod 8=2, not output. No.\n\nAnother idea: Perhaps the output is determined by the presence of a certain pattern involving 2s and8s. For example, each 2-pair is part of a T-shape with an8. Let's see.\n\nExample0: rows with 2-pairs have 8s nearby. For example, row1: [2,2,8,...]. So 2-pair followed by8. Maybe the output is the number that is adjacent to the 2-pairs. But example0's output is0, which is adjacent to some 2-pairs.\n\nThis is getting me nowhere. Let me try to think of the problem differently.\n\nThe outputs are either [0] or [8]. So the task is to classify the grid into one of these two. Looking at the examples, maybe the output is0 if the grid contains an even number of 2-pairs and8 if odd. But example0 has4 (even) \u21920. Example1 has4 \u21928. So no.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is0 if the number of 2-pairs is even and there are more 0s than8s, and8 otherwise. But this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is0 when the number of 2-pairs is even and the number of8s is even. Example0:4 pairs even, 8s even (6 \u2192 even). Output0. Example1:4 pairs even, 8s count is9 (odd). Output8. Example2: let's see.\n\nExample2's input:\n\n[8,2,2,8,8,0,0]\n[0,2,2,0,0,0,8]\n[0,8,8,0,0,8,0]\n[0,0,8,0,0,0,8]\n[8,0,8,8,8,2,2]\n[8,0,0,0,0,2,2]\n\nCount 2-pairs:\n\nRow0: 2,2 \u21921.\n\nRow1:2,2 \u21921.\n\nRow5:2,2 at end \u21921.\n\nRow6:2,2 \u21921.\n\nTotal 4 pairs. Even.\n\nCount of8s:\n\nRow0:8,8,8 \u21923.\n\nRow1:8.\n\nRow2:8,8,8 \u21923.\n\nRow3:8,8 \u21922.\n\nRow4:8,8,8,8 \u21924.\n\nRow5:8,8 \u21922.\n\nTotal3+1+3+2+4+2=15. Odd. So even pairs, odd8s \u2192 output8. Which matches example2's output8.\n\nExample3's input:\n\nOutput0.\n\nCount 2-pairs: Let's see.\n\nRows:\n\n[8,8,0,0,2,2,0] \u2192 2,2 \u21921.\n\n[0,8,8,0,2,2,8] \u21922,2 \u21921.\n\n[0,0,0,8,0,8,0] \u2192 none.\n\n[8,0,0,0,0,0,0] \u2192 none.\n\n[0,2,2,0,8,0,8] \u21922,2 \u21921.\n\n[0,2,2,8,8,0,8] \u21922,2 \u21921.\n\nTotal 1+1+1+1=4 pairs. Even.\n\nCount8s:\n\nRow0:8,8,2,2 \u2192 wait, row0 is [8,8,0,0,2,2,0]. So8s:2.\n\nRow1:8,8,8 \u21923.\n\nRow2:8,8 \u21922.\n\nRow3:8 \u21921.\n\nRow4:8,8 \u21922.\n\nRow5:8,8 \u21922.\n\nTotal2+3+2+1+2+2=12. Even.\n\nSo even pairs, even8s \u2192 output0. Which matches.\n\nExample4:\n\nInput:\n\n[8,0,0,0,0,8,0]\n[0,0,2,2,0,8,0]\n[8,0,2,2,0,0,0]\n[0,0,8,0,0,8,0]\n[0,0,8,2,2,0,8]\n[8,0,0,2,2,8,0]\n\nCount 2-pairs:\n\nRow1:2,2 \u21921.\n\nRow2:2,2 \u21921.\n\nRow4:2,2 \u21921.\n\nRow5:2,2 \u21921.\n\nRow6:2,2 \u21921.\n\nWait, rows are 0-5. So:\n\nRow1 (index1): [0,0,2,2,0,8,0] \u2192 yes.\n\nRow2: [8,0,2,2,0,0,0] \u2192 yes.\n\nRow4: [0,0,8,2,2,0,8] \u2192 yes.\n\nRow5: [8,0,0,2,2,8,0] \u2192 yes.\n\nTotal 4 pairs. Even.\n\nCount of8s:\n\nRow0:8,8 \u21922.\n\nRow1:8 \u21921.\n\nRow2:8 \u21921.\n\nRow3:8,8 \u21922.\n\nRow4:8,8 \u21922.\n\nRow5:8,8 \u21922.\n\nTotal 2+1+1+2+2+2=10. Even.\n\nSo even pairs, even8s \u2192 output should be0. But example4's output is8. Contradiction.\n\nSo this pattern doesn't hold for example4. What's different here?\n\nExample4's output is8. According to the previous pattern, it should be0. So there's something else.\n\nLet me recount example4's 8s and 2-pairs.\n\nWait, row4 is [0,0,8,2,2,0,8]. So two 8s. Row5: [8,0,0,2,2,8,0] \u2192 two 8s. Row0:8 and8. So total:\n\nRow0:2\n\nRow1:1\n\nRow2:1\n\nRow3:2\n\nRow4:2\n\nRow5:2\n\nTotal:2+1+1+2+2+2=10. Even.\n\nNumber of 2-pairs:4. Even.\n\nSo according to the previous pattern, output should be0, but actual output is8. So this pattern is invalid.\n\nHmm. What's different in example4?\n\nLooking at example4's input, maybe there are vertical 2-pairs. Let's check columns for vertical 2-pairs.\n\nFor example, in column4 of example4:\n\nRow4 has 2,2 at positions3 and4 (columns3 and4). So that's a horizontal pair. But vertical pairs: looking for two 2s in the same column.\n\nColumn3:\n\nRow1:2 (position3)\n\nRow2:2 (position3)\n\nRow4:2 (position3)\n\nRow5:2 (position3)\n\nSo column3 has 2 in rows1,2,4,5. But are they consecutive? Row1 and2 have 2s in column3. That's a vertical pair. Then row4 and5 also have 2s in column3. Another vertical pair. So two vertical pairs. So total vertical 2-pairs is2. Even.\n\nExample4's output is8. So previous pattern doesn't explain this.\n\nThis is really challenging. Maybe the correct pattern is that the output is the center element of the grid. For example0, it worked. Example1 worked. Example2,3,5 worked. Example4 is the exception. But why?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is the value that appears in the majority of the corners of the grid. Let's check example4's corners.\n\nCorners are:\n\nTop-left:8\n\nTop-right:0\n\nBottom-left:8\n\nBottom-right:0.\n\nSo 8 appears twice, 0 appears twice. No majority. Output is8. Maybe in case of tie, output8. So the test input's corners are:\n\nRows:8 rows, 6 columns.\n\nTest input corners:\n\nTop-left:0 (row0, column0)\n\nTop-right:0 (row0, column5)\n\nBottom-left:0 (row7, column0)\n\nBottom-right:0 (row7, column5).\n\nCorners:0 four times. So output would be0.\n\nBut in example4's case, corners are8,0,8,0. So tie, output8. According to that rule.\n\nSo possible pattern: output is the majority of the four corners, and in case of tie, output8.\n\nChecking training examples:\n\nExample0's corners:0,8,8,2. 0 once,8 twice,2 once. Majority8. But output0. So invalid.\n\nExample1's corners:0,0,0,0. All0. Output8. So invalid.\n\nHmm. This doesn't fit.\n\nAt this point, I'm stuck. I'll have to make an educated guess based on the examples where the center element matched the output. For the test input, the center is between rows3 and4, columns2 and3. The elements are0,0,0,8. The majority is0. So output should be0. But looking at the training examples like example4, it doesn't fit. But given time constraints, I'll go with this.",

        "cot_2": "Okay, let's tackle this puzzle. So, the task is to find the pattern in the training examples and apply it to the test input. Let's start by looking at the examples given.\n\nLooking at Example 0: The input is a 5x5 grid of numbers. The output is [0]. Similarly, other examples have outputs of either [0] or [8]. So the output is a single element list containing either 0 or 8. The key is to figure out what determines this value.\n\nLet me first look at the inputs and outputs. Maybe the output is based on the count of certain numbers. Let's check Example 0's input. The grid has several 0s, 2s, and 8s. Let's count the numbers. But maybe it's not just the total count. Let me check each example's total counts.\n\nExample 0 Input:\nRows:\n[0,0,8,0,8] \u2192 three 0s, two 8s\n[2,2,8,0,0] \u2192 two 2s, one 8, two 0s\n[2,2,0,0,8] \u2192 two 2s, two 0s, one 8\n[0,0,0,2,2] \u2192 three 0s, two 2s\n[8,8,0,2,2] \u2192 two 8s, one 0, two 2s\n\nTotal counts: 0s: 3+2+2+3+1 = 11? Wait, let's sum each row's 0s:\n\nRow 0: 3 zeros (positions 0,1,3)\nRow 1: 2 zeros (positions 3,4)\nRow 2: 2 zeros (positions 2,3)\nRow 3: 3 zeros (positions 0,1,2)\nRow 4: 1 zero (position 2)\nTotal 0s: 3+2+2+3+1 = 11.\n\nTotal 2s: row0:0, row1:2, row2:2, row3:2, row4:2 \u2192 2+2+2+2=8?\n\nTotal 8s: row0:2, row1:1, row2:1, row4:2 \u2192 2+1+1+2=6.\n\nBut output is 0. Not sure if counts matter. Maybe the arrangement.\n\nLooking at Example 1's output is 8. Let's check if the output is determined by the number that forms a certain pattern. Maybe looking for contiguous blocks. For instance, maybe the number that forms a closed loop or has the most enclosed regions. Alternatively, maybe parity of certain elements.\n\nWait, another approach: in the first example, the output is 0. Let's look at the positions of 0s, 2s, and 8s. Maybe they form some shapes. For example, 2s and 8s could be forming numbers. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the number that is present in the corners. Let's check Example 0. The four corners of the grid (each row is a list, but maybe the grid is considered as rows and columns). Wait, the grid in example 0 is 5 rows, each with 5 elements. The four corners of the entire grid would be the first and last elements of the first and last rows. Let's see:\n\nFirst row's first element: 0, last element:8.\nLast row's first element:8, last element:2.\nSo corners are 0,8,8,2. None of these are the same. Output is 0, which is present in two corners. Hmm. But in example 1, output is 8. Let's check example 1's corners. The input is 5 rows, each with 7 elements. So first row: first element 0, last 0. Last row: first 0, last 0. So corners are 0,0,0,0. But output is 8, which is not in the corners. So that idea might not work.\n\nAnother angle: Maybe the output is the number that appears the most in the borders. Let's check example 0. The borders would be the first and last rows and the first and last columns of each row.\n\nFirst row: all elements are border (since it's the first row). Last row: all elements. The first and last columns of each row. Let's count 0s, 2s, 8s in the borders.\n\nFirst row: 0,0,8,0,8 \u2192 elements 0,4 (indices 0 and 4) are 0 and 8. Wait, maybe the entire first and last rows are considered borders, plus the first and last elements of the middle rows.\n\nFor example 0:\n\nFirst row: all elements (since it's the top border)\nLast row: all elements (bottom border)\nMiddle rows (rows 1,2,3): first and last elements.\n\nSo borders would be:\n\nRow 0: all 5 elements.\nRow 4: all 5 elements.\nRows 1,2,3: elements 0 and 4 each.\n\nTotal elements in borders:\n\nRow 0: 5 elements.\nRow 1: elements 0 and 4 (values 2 and 0)\nRow 2: elements 0 and 4 (2 and 8)\nRow 3: elements 0 and 4 (0 and 2)\nRow 4: 5 elements.\n\nSo total elements in borders:\n\nRow0: 0,0,8,0,8 \u2192 elements: 0,0,8,0,8\nRow1: 2 (element0) and 0 (element4)\nRow2: 2 (element0) and 8 (element4)\nRow3:0 (element0) and 2 (element4)\nRow4:8,8,0,2,2 \u2192 8,8,0,2,2\n\nSo all these elements in borders. Let's count 0s, 2s, 8s.\n\nRow0: 0,0,8,0,8 \u2192 0s: 3, 8s:2\nRow1: 2, 0 \u2192 2 and 0\nRow2: 2,8 \u2192 2 and8\nRow3:0,2 \u21920 and2\nRow4:8,8,0,2,2 \u21928s:2,0:1, 2s:2\n\nTotal counts:\n\n0s: 3 (row0) +1 (row1) +1 (row3) +1 (row4) \u2192 total 6\n2s: 1 (row1) +1 (row2) +1 (row3) +2 (row4) \u2192 total 5\n8s:2 (row0) +1 (row2) +2 (row4) \u21925\n\nSo 0s:6, 8s:5, 2s:5. The output is 0. Which matches the highest count in the borders. But example 1's output is 8. Let's check example 1.\n\nExample1 input is 5 rows, each with 7 elements.\n\nBorders would be first row (all elements), last row (all elements), and first and last elements of rows 1,2,3.\n\nRow0: 0,8,0,0,0,0,0 \u2192 elements 0-6. All are border.\nRow4:0,8,0,0,8,0,0 \u2192 all elements are border.\nRows1,2,3: elements 0 and 6.\n\nSo count elements in borders:\n\nRow0: 0,8,0,0,0,0,0 \u2192 0s:6, 8:1\nRow1:2 (element0), 0 (element6)\nRow2:2 (element0),2 (element6)\nRow3:0 (element0),2 (element6)\nRow4:0,8,0,0,8,0,0 \u2192 0s:5, 8:2\n\nTotal 0s:6 (row0) +1 (row1) +0 (row2) +1 (row3) +5 (row4) =13\n8s:1 (row0) +2 (row4) =3\n2s:1 (row1) +2 (row2) +1 (row3) =4\n\nBut output is 8. That doesn't fit, because 0 has the highest count. So maybe this approach is wrong.\n\nAlternative idea: Maybe the output is determined by the number (0 or 8) that forms a closed loop in the grid. For example, 8 is a digit with two loops, 0 has one loop. Maybe the answer counts the number of loops in the grid and returns 8 if even, 0 if odd? Let me see.\n\nBut how would that work. Let's look at example0. The output is 0. How many loops in the grid?\n\nEach 8 contributes two loops, each 0 contributes one. Let's compute total loops:\n\nExample0: 8s count as 6 (from previous count) \u2192 6 *2 =12 loops. 0s:11 \u2192 11 loops. Total 12+11=23. 23 is odd. So output is 0 (since 0's loop count is odd?) Not sure. But example1's output is 8. Let's check:\n\nExample1: 8s count is... in the input. Let's count.\n\nLooking back at example1 input:\n\nINPUT:\n[0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[2, 2, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0]\n[2, 2, 8, 8, 0, 2, 2]\n[0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 2, 2]\n[0, 8, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0]\n\nCount 8s in each row:\n\nRow0: 1\nRow1:3\nRow2:2\nRow3:1\nRow4:2\nTotal:1+3+2+1+2=9. So 9 *2=18 loops from 8s. 0s count as:\n\nRow0:5 zeros (excluding the 8)\nRow1:1 zero (element2 and 6) \u2192 wait, row1 is [2,2,0,8,8,8,0]. Zeros are elements2 and6 \u2192 2 zeros.\nRow2: 1 zero (element4)\nRow3:3 zeros (elements0,1,4)\nRow4:4 zeros (elements0,2,3,5,6? Wait, row4: [0,8,0,0,8,0,0] \u2192 elements0,2,3,5,6 are 0s. That's 5 zeros. Wait, let me recount:\n\nRow0: elements 0:0, 2:0, 3:0,4:0,5:0,6:0 \u2192 6 zeros? Wait, the input row0 is [0,8,0,0,0,0,0]. So the elements are 0,8,0,0,0,0,0. So zeros are positions 0,2,3,4,5,6 \u2192 6 zeros. So 6.\n\nRow1: [2,2,0,8,8,8,0] \u2192 zeros at positions2 and6 \u2192 2 zeros.\nRow2: [2,2,8,8,0,2,2] \u2192 zero at position4 \u2192 1 zero.\nRow3: [0,0,8,0,0,2,2] \u2192 zeros at positions0,1,3,4 \u2192 4 zeros?\nWait, the list is [0,0,8,0,0,2,2]. So elements0,1,3,4 are zeros. So 4 zeros.\nRow4: [0,8,0,0,8,0,0] \u2192 elements0,2,3,5,6 \u2192 5 zeros.\n\nTotal zeros: 6+2+1+4+5=18. Each 0 contributes 1 loop, so 18 loops.\n\n8s:9 *2=18 loops.\n\nTotal loops: 18+18=36, which is even. Output is 8. Maybe if total loops are even, output is 8; if odd, output 0. Let's check this hypothesis with other examples.\n\nExample0:\n\nTotal loops: 8s count is 6 \u2192 6*2=12. Zeros count 11 \u2192 11*1=11. Total 23 \u2192 odd. Output is 0. Which fits.\n\nExample1: total loops 36 \u2192 even \u2192 output 8. Correct.\n\nExample2: Output is 8. Let's compute loops.\n\nExample2 input:\n\n[8, 2, 2, 8, 8, 0, 0]\n[0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 8]\n[0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 8, 0]\n[0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8]\n[8, 0, 8, 8, 8, 2, 2]\n[8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2]\n\nCount 8s and 0s.\n\n8s per row:\n\nRow0: elements0:8,3:8,4:8 \u2192 3\nRow1: element6:8 \u21921\nRow2: elements1:8,2:8,5:8 \u21923\nRow3: elements2:8,6:8 \u21922\nRow4: elements0:8,2:8,3:8,4:8 \u21924\nRow5: element0:8 \u21921\nTotal 8s:3+1+3+2+4+1=14 \u2192 14*2=28 loops.\n\n0s per row:\n\nRow0: elements5,6 \u21922\nRow1: elements0,3,4,5 \u21924\nRow2: elements0,3,4 \u21923\nRow3: elements0,1,3,4,5 \u21925\nRow4: element1 \u21921\nRow5: elements1,2,3,4 \u21924\nTotal 0s:2+4+3+5+1+4=19 \u219219 loops.\n\nTotal loops:28+19=47 \u2192 odd. Output is 8. Wait, but according to previous hypothesis, even would be 8, odd 0. But example2's output is 8. So contradiction. So that hypothesis is incorrect.\n\nHmm. Let me check other examples. Maybe the hypothesis is wrong.\n\nLet's check example3. Output is 0.\n\nExample3 input:\n\n[8, 8, 0, 0, 2, 2, 0]\n[0, 8, 8, 0, 2, 2, 8]\n[0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 8, 0]\n[8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[0, 2, 2, 0, 8, 0, 8]\n[0, 2, 2, 8, 8, 0, 8]\n\nCount 8s and 0s.\n\n8s:\n\nRow0: elements0,1 \u21922\nRow1: elements1,2,6 \u21923\nRow2: elements3,5 \u21922\nRow3: element0 \u21921\nRow4: elements4,6 \u21922\nRow5: elements3,4,6 \u21923\nTotal 2+3+2+1+2+3=13 \u219213*2=26 loops.\n\n0s:\n\nRow0: elements2,3,6 \u21923\nRow1: elements0,3 \u21922\nRow2: elements0,1,2,4,6 \u21925\nRow3: elements1,2,3,4,5 \u21925\nRow4: elements0,3,5 \u21923\nRow5: elements6 \u21921? Wait row5 is [0,2,2,8,8,0,8]. So zeros are elements0 and5 \u21922 zeros.\nWait, row5: first element is 0, then 2,2,8,8,0,8. So zeros at positions0 and5. So 2 zeros.\n\nTotal zeros:3+2+5+5+3+2=20 \u219220 loops.\n\nTotal loops:26+20=46 \u2192 even. Output should be 8, but example3's output is 0. So this breaks the hypothesis. So that's not the right approach.\n\nAlternative approach: Maybe the output is the number (0 or8) that appears in a specific position. For example, the center of the grid. But grids vary in size. Let's check example0's grid: 5x5. The center would be row2, position2. In example0, row2 is [2,2,0,0,8], so position2 is 0. Output is 0. Example1's grid is 5 rows of 7 elements. Center would be row2, position3 (since 7 elements, middle is 3rd index). Row2 is [2,2,8,8,0,2,2], position3 is8. Output is8. So that fits. Example2's grid is6 rows of7 elements. Center would be between rows2 and3. But maybe the center cell depends on rows and columns. Let's check example2's output is8. If the middle row is row3, which is [0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0,8]. The middle element (position3) is0. But output is8. Doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is determined by the sum of all elements modulo something. Let's see:\n\nExample0: sum all elements. Let's compute:\n\nRow0:0+0+8+0+8=16\nRow1:2+2+8+0+0=12\nRow2:2+2+0+0+8=12\nRow3:0+0+0+2+2=4\nRow4:8+8+0+2+2=20\nTotal sum:16+12+12+4+20=64. 64 mod 10 is4. Not directly 0 or8.\n\nExample1 sum:\n\nRow0:0+8+0+0+0+0+0=8\nRow1:2+2+0+8+8+8+0=28\nRow2:2+2+8+8+0+2+2=24\nRow3:0+0+8+0+0+2+2=12\nRow4:0+8+0+0+8+0+0=16\nTotal:8+28=36+24=60+12=72+16=88. 88 mod10=8. Output is8. That matches. Example0 sum64 mod10=4, output0. Doesn't match. So this idea is also invalid.\n\nAlternative idea: Maybe the output is the number that appears in all four corners of the grid. Let's check.\n\nExample0's grid is5x5. Corners are:\n\n(0,0) \u21920\n\n(0,4) \u21928\n\n(4,0) \u21928\n\n(4,4) \u21922.\n\nThe corners have 0,8,8,2. The common number? None. But output is0. Hmm.\n\nExample1's grid is5x7. Corners:\n\n(0,0)=0, (0,6)=0\n\n(4,0)=0, (4,6)=0.\n\nAll corners are 0. Output is8. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAnother approach: Maybe the output is the number that appears in the majority of the rows' first or last elements. For example, looking at the first element of each row and the last element of each row. Let's check example0:\n\nRows:\n\n0: [0,0,8,0,8] \u2192 first 0, last8\n1: [2,2,8,0,0] \u2192 first2, last0\n2: [2,2,0,0,8] \u2192 first2, last8\n3: [0,0,0,2,2] \u2192 first0, last2\n4: [8,8,0,2,2] \u2192 first8, last2\n\nFirst elements:0,2,2,0,8 \u2192 0 appears twice, 2 appears twice,8 once.\n\nLast elements:8,0,8,2,2 \u21928:2,0:1,2:2.\n\nSo the most common first or last elements are 0 and 2 (each twice). But output is0. Not sure.\n\nExample1:\n\nFirst elements of rows:\n\n0:0, 1:2, 2:2, 3:0, 4:0 \u2192 0 appears3 times, 2 appears2.\n\nLast elements:\n\n0:0, 1:0, 2:2,3:2,4:0 \u21920:3, 2:2.\n\nSo first elements have 0 three times, last elements have 0 three times. Output is8. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternative Idea: Maybe the output is the number that forms a plus sign (+) in the grid. For example, a cross shape where the center has a certain number, and the arms are same. Let's check example0. The grid is5x5. The center is row2, column2. Which is0. Then, the cross would be the cells up, down, left, right. But in example0, the center is0, but the output is0. Maybe if the cross is all the same number.\n\nIn example0, row2, column2 is0. The cells around it (up, down, left, right) are:\n\nup: row1 column2 is8\n\ndown: row3 column2 is0\n\nleft: row2 column1 is2\n\nright: row2 column3 is0.\n\nSo the cross has 8,0,2,0. Not all the same. So output is0. Not sure.\n\nAnother Idea: Looking for symmetry. For example, if the grid has horizontal or vertical symmetry, then output is0 or8. Let's check example0. The grid:\n\nRow0: [0,0,8,0,8]\n\nRow1: [2,2,8,0,0]\n\nRow2: [2,2,0,0,8]\n\nRow3: [0,0,0,2,2]\n\nRow4: [8,8,0,2,2]\n\nChecking vertical symmetry (mirror left-right). For row0: elements 0 and4 are0 and8. Element1 and3 are0 and0. So not symmetric. Similarly, row4: elements0 and4 are8 and2. Not symmetric. So no overall symmetry. Not sure.\n\nAlternative Idea: Maybe the output is determined by the number that appears in the same position in all rows. For example, a column where all elements are the same. Let's check example0. Looking for any column where all elements are 0 or8.\n\nColumns:\n\nColumn0: 0,2,2,0,8 \u2192 no.\nColumn1:0,2,2,0,8 \u2192 no.\nColumn2:8,8,0,0,0 \u2192 no.\nColumn3:0,0,0,2,2 \u2192 no.\nColumn4:8,0,8,2,2 \u2192 no.\n\nNo column has all same numbers. So that's not it.\n\nAnother thought: Maybe the output is the number that is in the majority of the central column(s) for odd-width grids. For even-width, perhaps different. Let's see.\n\nExample0's grid is5x5 (odd columns). Central column is index2. Looking at each row's column2:\n\nRow0:8\n\nRow1:8\n\nRow2:0\n\nRow3:0\n\nRow4:0\n\nSo majority is0. Output is0. This fits.\n\nExample1's grid is5 rows,7 columns. Central column is index3 (since columns are 0-6). So each row's column3:\n\nRow0:0\n\nRow1:8\n\nRow2:8\n\nRow3:0\n\nRow4:0\n\nMajority is0. But output is8. Doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. So maybe not.\n\nAlternative Idea: Perhaps the output is the number that is present in the four corners of the entire grid. For example, if all four corners are 0, output is0. If all are8, output is8. If mixed, maybe some other rule. Let's check.\n\nExample0: corners are (0,0)=0, (0,4)=8, (4,0)=8, (4,4)=2. Mixed. Output is0.\n\nExample1: corners are (0,0)=0, (0,6)=0, (4,0)=0, (4,6)=0. All0. Output is8. So that's not matching.\n\nAnother Idea: Maybe the output is the number that is missing from the borders. Like, if the border contains only 0 and2, then output is8. For example0's borders, which have 0s,2s, and8s. So output is0. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the number that appears exactly once in the entire grid. But example0 has multiple 0s and8s. So that's not.\n\nAlternative approach: Look for the output being the result of some parity check. For example, sum of all 8s modulo something. But example0 has6 8s. 6 mod 2 is0, output0. Example1 has9 8s.9 mod2=1, output8. Doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the number (0 or8) that is present in an even number of cells. For example0: 0s are11 (odd) \u2192 output0. 8s are6 (even). So output0 is the odd count. But example1's 0s are 18 (even), 8s 9 (odd). Output is8. So maybe the output is the number with even count. But example0's 0s are11 (odd), output0. Contradicts.\n\nHmm.\n\nWait, maybe the pattern is related to the positions where the numbers 2 are. Because in some examples, 2s are grouped in pairs. Like [2,2] appears often. Maybe the 2s are part of the pattern. But the output is0 or8. Perhaps the 2s form a path or enclosure for0 or8.\n\nAlternatively, the output could be determined by the number (0 or8) that is completely enclosed by 2s. For example, if there's a region of 0s surrounded by 2s, output0. Or similarly for8.\n\nLooking at example0's input:\n\nLooking for 0s surrounded by 2s. Let's see. For instance, in example0's row0, 8s are in the middle. But I don't see an enclosed region.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is the number that is enclosed by 2s in a cross pattern. For example, if a 0 or8 is surrounded by 2s in up, down, left, right, then output that number.\n\nLooking at example0's input, maybe the center cell is0. Let's see: row2, column2 is0. What are the adjacent cells?\n\nUp: row1 column2 is8.\n\nDown: row3 column2 is0.\n\nLeft: row2 column1 is2.\n\nRight: row2 column3 is0.\n\nSo the cell to the left is2. Not surrounded by 2s. So maybe not.\n\nAnother Idea: The output could be the number (0 or8) that appears in the same row as two consecutive 2s. Let's check.\n\nIn example0, rows have 2s grouped as [2,2]. Looking at the input:\n\nRow1: [2,2,8,0,0]\n\nRow2: [2,2,0,0,8]\n\nRow3: [0,0,0,2,2]\n\nRow4: [8,8,0,2,2]\n\nSo rows1,2,3,4 have [2,2] pairs. The output is0. Which of these rows have 0s or8s in the same row?\n\nRow1: 2,2,8,0,0 \u2192 has 8 and0.\n\nRow2: 2,2,0,0,8 \u2192 has0 and8.\n\nRow3:0,0,0,2,2 \u2192 has0.\n\nRow4:8,8,0,2,2 \u2192 has8 and0.\n\nSo perhaps the output is the number that appears the most in rows that have [2,2]. In example0, rows1-4 have [2,2]. Let's count the numbers in those rows.\n\nRows1: 0s:2,8:1.\n\nRow2:0s:2,8:1.\n\nRow3:0s:3.\n\nRow4:0:1,8s:2.\n\nTotal 0s:2+2+3+1=8.\n\n8s:1+1+2=4.\n\nSo 0 is more frequent. Output0.\n\nExample1's output is8. Let's see.\n\nExample1's input:\n\n[0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n[2, 2, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0]\n\n[2, 2, 8, 8, 0, 2, 2]\n\n[0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 2, 2]\n\n[0, 8, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0]\n\nLooking for rows with [2,2]. Rows1,2,3:\n\nRow1: [2,2,0,8,8,8,0] \u2192 starts with [2,2]\n\nRow2: [2,2,8,8,0,2,2] \u2192 starts and ends with [2,2]\n\nRow3: [0,0,8,0,0,2,2] \u2192 ends with [2,2]\n\nRow4 has no [2,2].\n\nSo rows1,2,3 have [2,2]. Now count 0s and8s in those rows.\n\nRow1:0s in positions2,6 \u21922 zeros. 8s in positions3,4,5 \u21923 eights.\n\nRow2:8s in positions2,3 \u21922. 0 in position4. 2,2 at end. So 8s:2,0s:1.\n\nRow3:8 in position2. 0s in positions0,1,3,4 \u21924 zeros. 2,2 at end.\n\nTotal 0s:2+1+4=7.\n\n8s:3+2+1=6.\n\nSo 0s are more frequent. But output is8. So this hypothesis is incorrect.\n\nHmm. This is challenging.\n\nAlternative Idea: Maybe the output is determined by the number of 2x2 squares containing two 2s and two of either 0 or8. For example, if such squares exist and the majority is 0, then output0. But this seems complicated.\n\nAlternatively, looking for the presence of \"islands\" of 2s. For example, if there's a contiguous block of 2s forming a certain shape.\n\nAlternatively, think of the grid as a binary matrix where 0 and8 are one value and 2s are another. Maybe the output depends on some property of the 0/8 regions.\n\nAlternatively, let's look at the parity of the number of 2x2 blocks that contain exactly two 2s. Not sure.\n\nAnother Idea: Let's look at the test input and see if I can find a pattern. The test input is:\n\n[0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n[0, 0, 0, 8, 2, 2]\n\n[0, 8, 8, 8, 2, 2]\n\n[0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8]\n\n[0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0]\n\n[8, 2, 2, 0, 0, 8]\n\n[0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0]\n\n[0, 8, 0, 8, 8, 0]\n\nIt has8 rows, each with6 elements. The output should be either [0] or [8]. \n\nLooking at the training examples, each example's output corresponds to the majority of the corners? Or perhaps the number that appears in the majority of the first and/or last elements of the rows.\n\nLooking back at example5:\n\nINPUT:\n\n[8,0,0,2,2,8]\n\n[8,0,8,2,2,0]\n\n[0,0,0,0,8,0]\n\n[2,2,8,0,8,0]\n\n[2,2,0,0,0,8]\n\n[0,8,8,0,8,0]\n\nOUTPUT: [0]\n\nCheck the first and last elements of each row:\n\nRow0:8 and8\n\nRow1:8 and0\n\nRow2:0 and0\n\nRow3:2 and0\n\nRow4:2 and8\n\nRow5:0 and0\n\nFirst elements:8,8,0,2,2,0 \u2192 8:2, 0:2, 2:2.\n\nLast elements:8,0,0,0,8,0 \u2192 0:4,8:2.\n\nBut output is0. Maybe the majority in last elements is0. So in this example, output is0.\n\nExample1's output is8, but majority in last elements is0 (example1's last elements are0,0,2,2,0 \u21920:3, 2:2. Output is8. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAnother Idea: Perhaps the output is the number that appears in the first and last row's first element. For example0, first row's first element is0, last row's first element is8. Output is0. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the output is the number that appears in the majority of the first and last elements of all rows. For example0:\n\nFirst elements:0,2,2,0,8 \u21920:2,2:2,8:1. Last elements:8,0,8,2,2 \u21928:2,0:1,2:2. Combining first and last: 0 appears2 times,2 appears4 times,8 appears3 times. Output is0, which isn't the majority.\n\nThis is tough. Let's try to find another pattern.\n\nLooking at example0 and example3, which both have output0. Let's see their inputs:\n\nExample0's input has a lot of 0s and 8s, but the output is0. Example3's output is0, but the input has a mix. Example5's output is0. Let's see if there's a commonality in these cases.\n\nAnother Idea: Maybe the output is the number (0 or8) that appears in the same row as two consecutive 2s. For example, in example0, rows with [2,2] have 0s and8s. If the number of rows where 0 is present with [2,2] is greater than those with8, output0. Let's check:\n\nExample0: rows with [2,2] are rows1,2,3,4.\n\nRow1: contains8 and0.\n\nRow2: contains0 and8.\n\nRow3: contains0.\n\nRow4: contains8 and0.\n\nCount for 0s in these rows: rows1,2,3,4 all have 0s. So in each of these rows, 0 appears at least once. So output could be0. \n\nExample1: rows with [2,2] are rows1,2,3.\n\nRow1: has0 and8.\n\nRow2: has8 and0.\n\nRow3: has0 and8.\n\nIn these rows, 8 appears in all of them, and 0 also. But output is8. So maybe if 8 appears more in those rows, output is8.\n\nExample0's rows with [2,2] have 0s in all of them. Output0.\n\nExample1's rows with [2,2] have 8s in all of them. Output8.\n\nExample2's output is8. Let's check:\n\nExample2's input has rows with [2,2]?\n\nLooking at example2's input:\n\nRow0: [8,2,2,8,8,0,0] \u2192 [2,2] in positions1-2.\n\nRow1: [0,2,2,0,0,0,8] \u2192 [2,2] in positions1-2.\n\nRow2: [0,8,8,0,0,8,0] \u2192 no [2,2].\n\nRow3: [0,0,8,0,0,0,8] \u2192 no.\n\nRow4: [8,0,8,8,8,2,2] \u2192 [2,2] at end.\n\nRow5: [8,0,0,0,0,2,2] \u2192 [2,2] at end.\n\nSo rows0,1,4,5 have [2,2].\n\nIn these rows:\n\nRow0: has8s and0s.\n\nRow1: has0s and8.\n\nRow4: has8s and0.\n\nRow5: has8 and0.\n\nSo 8s are present in all these rows. So output is8.\n\nThis seems to fit. So the hypothesis is: the output is the number (0 or8) that appears in all the rows that contain a [2,2] pair. If both 0 and8 are present in all such rows, maybe the majority, or the one that appears in all rows. Wait, example0's rows with [2,2] (rows1,2,3,4):\n\nRow1: has 8 and0.\n\nRow2: has0 and8.\n\nRow3: has0.\n\nRow4: has8 and0.\n\nSo 0 appears in all these rows. 8 appears in rows1,2,4 but not row3. So output0.\n\nExample1's rows with [2,2] are rows1,2,3:\n\nRow1:0 and8.\n\nRow2:8 and0.\n\nRow3:0 and8.\n\nSo 8 appears in all these rows. 0 appears in all as well. But output is8. Hmm. So this doesn't fit. Because both 0 and8 are present in all rows.\n\nBut output is8. So maybe if 8 is present in all such rows and 0 isn't, but in example1's case, both are present. So this approach may not work.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the number that appears in all rows that have a [2,2] pair, and if both 0 and8 are present, some other rule applies. But this is getting complicated.\n\nAlternative Idea: Let's think of the [2,2] pairs as forming boundaries, and the output is the number enclosed by these boundaries. For example, if the [2,2] pairs form a loop around 0s or8s.\n\nBut without visualizing the grids, this is hard to determine.\n\nLet's try to see the test input's rows with [2,2] pairs.\n\nTest input:\n\nRows:\n\n[0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0] \u2192 no [2,2].\n\n[0, 0, 0, 8, 2, 2] \u2192 ends with [2,2].\n\n[0, 8, 8, 8, 2, 2] \u2192 ends with [2,2].\n\n[0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8] \u2192 no.\n\n[0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0] \u2192 no.\n\n[8, 2, 2, 0, 0, 8] \u2192 starts with [2,2].\n\n[0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0] \u2192 starts with [2,2].\n\n[0, 8, 0, 8, 8, 0] \u2192 no.\n\nSo rows1,2,5,6 have [2,2].\n\nNow, check which number (0 or8) appears in all of these rows.\n\nRow1: [0,0,0,8,2,2] \u2192 has 0 and8.\n\nRow2: [0,8,8,8,2,2] \u2192 has0 and8.\n\nRow5: [8,2,2,0,0,8] \u2192 has8 and0.\n\nRow6: [0,2,2,0,0,0] \u2192 has0.\n\nSo in all these rows, 0 is present. 8 is present in rows1,2,5 but not in row6. So 0 appears in all rows with [2,2], including row6. So according to the previous hypothesis (output is the number present in all such rows), the output would be0.\n\nBut need to check if this pattern holds in the training examples.\n\nExample5's output is0. Let's see its rows with [2,2]:\n\nExample5's input:\n\n[8,0,0,2,2,8]\n\n[8,0,8,2,2,0]\n\n[0,0,0,0,8,0]\n\n[2,2,8,0,8,0]\n\n[2,2,0,0,0,8]\n\n[0,8,8,0,8,0]\n\nRows with [2,2] are rows0,1,3,4.\n\nRow0: has8 and0.\n\nRow1: has8 and0.\n\nRow3: has8 and0.\n\nRow4: has0.\n\nSo 0 appears in all rows with [2,2], 8 appears in rows0,1,3 but not row4. So output0.\n\nExample3's output is0. Let's check:\n\nExample3's input:\n\n[8,8,0,0,2,2,0]\n\n[0,8,8,0,2,2,8]\n\n[0,0,0,8,0,8,0]\n\n[8,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\n[0,2,2,0,8,0,8]\n\n[0,2,2,8,8,0,8]\n\nRows with [2,2]:\n\nRow0: ends with [2,2].\n\nRow1: ends with [2,2].\n\nRow4: starts with [2,2].\n\nRow5: starts with [2,2].\n\nCheck if 0 is present in all these rows.\n\nRow0: [8,8,0,0,2,2,0] \u2192 has0 and8.\n\nRow1: [0,8,8,0,2,2,8] \u2192 has0 and8.\n\nRow4: [0,2,2,0,8,0,8] \u2192 has0 and8.\n\nRow5: [0,2,2,8,8,0,8] \u2192 has0 and8.\n\nSo 0 is present in all these rows, 8 is also present. But output is0. So maybe when both are present, output is0. Or perhaps the count of 0s in these rows is higher.\n\nIn example3's rows with [2,2], count of 0s and8s:\n\nRow0:0s:3,8s:2.\n\nRow1:0s:1,8s:4.\n\nRow4:0s:3,8s:2.\n\nRow5:0s:1,8s:4.\n\nTotal 0s:3+1+3+1=8.\n\n8s:2+4+2+4=12.\n\nSo 8s are more. But output is0. So this hypothesis is incorrect.\n\nThis is very confusing. Let's try to find another pattern.\n\nLooking at the outputs again:\n\nExample0: output0.\n\nExample1: output8.\n\nExample2: output8.\n\nExample3: output0.\n\nExample4: output8.\n\nExample5: output0.\n\nLooking for a pattern in the outputs: 0,8,8,0,8,0. Maybe alternating, but not sure.\n\nAlternative Idea: The output is the number that appears in the majority of the positions adjacent to the [2,2] pairs. For example, look at the cells next to the [2,2] pairs and see which number is more frequent.\n\nTake example0's [2,2] pairs:\n\nRow1: [2,2,8,0,0]. The [2,2] is at positions0-1. The adjacent cells are row0, column0-1 (but no row above), to the right is8. So adjacent cells to the [2,2] are8 (right) and row2's cells (below).\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the numbers immediately before or after the [2,2] pairs. For example, in row1 of example0, after [2,2] comes8. So maybe the number following [2,2] is8. The output is0. Not sure.\n\nBut example0's output is0. Let's see:\n\nExample0's rows with [2,2] and the adjacent numbers:\n\nRow1: [2,2,8,0,0] \u2192 after [2,2] comes8.\n\nRow2: [2,2,0,0,8] \u2192 after [2,2] comes0.\n\nRow3: [0,0,0,2,2] \u2192 after [2,2] is end of row.\n\nRow4: [8,8,0,2,2] \u2192 after [2,2] is end of row.\n\nSo the adjacent numbers after [2,2] are8,0, end, end. So 8 and0. Output is0. Not sure.\n\nExample1's rows with [2,2]:\n\nRow1: [2,2,0,8,8,8,0] \u2192 after [2,2] is0.\n\nRow2: [2,2,8,8,0,2,2] \u2192 after [2,2] is8.\n\nRow3: [0,0,8,0,0,2,2] \u2192 after [2,2] is end.\n\nSo adjacent numbers are0 and8. Output is8.\n\nMaybe the majority of these adjacent numbers determines the output. In example0: 8 and0 \u2192 one each. Output0. Example1: 0 and8 \u2192 output8. Doesn't fit.\n\nAnother Idea: Maybe the output is the number that is not present in any of the [2,2] rows. For example, if all [2,2] rows contain 0, output0. If all contain8, output8. But in example0's case, some [2,2] rows have8. So that's not.\n\nAlternatively, the output is the number that is present in the majority of the rows that do not contain [2,2]. For example0: the only row without [2,2] is row0. Row0 has 0 and8. So majority 0. Output0. Example1's rows without [2,2] are row0 and row4. Row0 has0 and8, row4 has0 and8. So majority 0. Output8. Doesn't fit.\n\nThis is really tricky. Let me try to find a different approach. Perhaps the output is determined by the number that forms the majority in the intersection of the first and last rows and first and last columns.\n\nAlternatively, think of the grid as a maze where 2s are walls and 0/8 are paths. The output is the number that forms a continuous path from start to end.\n\nBut without visualization, this is hard.\n\nAnother Idea: Let's consider that the 2s are acting as boundaries, and the output is the number (0 or8) that is enclosed by the 2s. For example, if there's an area surrounded by 2s containing only0s, output0.\n\nLooking at example0:\n\nThere are 2s in various places. For instance, row1 and2 have [2,2] at the start, and row3 and4 have [2,2] at the end. Maybe this forms a ring around some 0s. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, look for regions of 0s or8s that are completely enclosed by 2s.\n\nIn example0's row3: [0,0,0,2,2]. The 0s are not enclosed by 2s. Row4 has 8,8,0,2,2: 0 is followed by 2s. Not enclosed.\n\nExample1's output is8. Maybe there's an 8 enclosed by 2s.\n\nRow2 of example1's input: [2,2,8,8,0,2,2]. The 8s are between 2s on both ends. So enclosed by 2s. So output is8.\n\nExample0's output is0. Maybe there's a0 enclosed by 2s. Row2 has [2,2,0,0,8]. The 0 is after 2s but not enclosed.\n\nExample5's input:\n\n[8,0,0,2,2,8]\n\n[8,0,8,2,2,0]\n\n[0,0,0,0,8,0]\n\n[2,2,8,0,8,0]\n\n[2,2,0,0,0,8]\n\n[0,8,8,0,8,0]\n\nRow0 has [2,2] at positions3-4. Between them is nothing. The 0s are before the 2s. Row1 has [2,2] at positions3-4, with8 and0 before and after. Row3 has [2,2] at start, followed by8. Row4 has [2,2] at start, followed by0. So maybe the 0 in row4 is enclosed. Output is0.\n\nThis pattern could explain some examples, but how to verify without visualization.\n\nAnother Idea: The output is the number that appears in the same row as a [2,2] pair and is immediately followed or preceded by that pair. For example, in example1's row2: [2,2,8,8,0,2,2]. The 8 comes after the first [2,2]. The output is8. In example0's row1: [2,2,8,0,0], 8 comes after [2,2]. Output0. So this doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. I'm stuck. Let me look at the test input again and see if I can find a pattern based on the training examples.\n\nTest input:\n\nRows with [2,2] are rows1,2,5,6.\n\nRow1: [0,0,0,8,2,2] \u2192 ends with [2,2], elements before are8.\n\nRow2: [0,8,8,8,2,2] \u2192 ends with [2,2], elements before are8.\n\nRow5: [8,2,2,0,0,8] \u2192 starts with [2,2], followed by0.\n\nRow6: [0,2,2,0,0,0] \u2192 starts with [2,2], followed by0.\n\nIn these rows, the [2,2] pairs are preceded by8 in rows1 and2, and by0 in rows5 and6. So the numbers immediately before/after [2,2] are8 and0.\n\nIn training example0, the rows with [2,2] have 0 and8. Output0.\n\nIn example1, the [2,2] rows have 0 and8. Output8.\n\nSo this doesn't directly determine the output. \n\nAnother Idea: Maybe the output is the number that appears in the same row as a [2,2] pair and is adjacent to it. For example, if a [2,2] is followed by8, then count for8. If followed by0, count for0. Sum the counts and see which is higher.\n\nIn test input:\n\nRow1: [2,2] is preceded by8. So count8.\n\nRow2: [2,2] preceded by8. Count8.\n\nRow5: [2,2] followed by0. Count0.\n\nRow6: [2,2] followed by0. Count0.\n\nTotal counts:8:2,0:2. Tie. So how to break? Maybe look for other factors.\n\nIn the test input, there are four [2,2] pairs. Two are preceded by8, two are followed by0. But this doesn't resolve the tie.\n\nAnother Idea: Let's consider the number of 0s and8s in the entire grid. For the test input:\n\nLet's count 0s and8s.\n\nRows:\n\nRow0: [0,8,0,0,0,0] \u2192 0:4,8:1.\n\nRow1: [0,0,0,8,2,2] \u21920:3,8:1.\n\nRow2: [0,8,8,8,2,2] \u21920:1,8:3.\n\nRow3: [0,8,0,0,0,8] \u21920:3,8:2.\n\nRow4: [0,0,0,8,0,0] \u21920:5,8:1.\n\nRow5: [8,2,2,0,0,8] \u21920:2,8:2.\n\nRow6: [0,2,2,0,0,0] \u21920:4.\n\nRow7: [0,8,0,8,8,0] \u21920:3,8:3.\n\nTotal 0s:4+3+1+3+5+2+4+3= 25.\n\n8s:1+1+3+2+1+2+0+3= 13.\n\nTotal loops:0s*1 +8s*2=25 +26=51 \u2192 odd. According to previous hypothesis, output0. But in example1, even loops gave output8, but example3 had even loops and output0. So this isn't reliable.\n\nBut test input has 25 0s and13 8s. 25 is odd. If output is0 when total loops are odd, then output0. But example2 had 47 loops (odd) and output8. So this doesn't work.\n\nI'm really stuck. Let me look for a different pattern. Maybe the output is the number that appears in the majority of the last elements of each row. Let's check test input:\n\nLast elements of each row (8 rows):\n\nRow0:0\n\nRow1:2 \u2192 not 0 or8.\n\nRow2:2 \u2192 not.\n\nRow3:8\n\nRow4:0\n\nRow5:8\n\nRow6:0\n\nRow7:0\n\nSo 0 appears in row0, row4, row6, row7 \u21924 times.\n\n8 appears in row3, row5 \u21922 times.\n\nBut the output is either0 or8. The last elements of rows include 0,8, but also2s which are ignored. So among the valid elements (0 and8), 0 appears 4 times and8 appears2. So majority is0. So output0.\n\nLooking back at examples:\n\nExample0's last elements are8,0,8,2,2. Valid elements are8,0,8. 8 appears2 times,0 once. Output0. Doesn't fit majority.\n\nExample1's last elements are0,0,2,2,0. Valid elements are0,0. Majority0. Output8. Doesn't fit.\n\nSo this approach is incorrect.\n\nFinal Idea: Perhaps the output is determined by the number that forms a diagonal in the grid. For example, from top-left to bottom-right. Let's check.\n\nExample0's grid is5x5. Diagonal elements:\n\nRow0:0\n\nRow1:2\n\nRow2:0\n\nRow3:0\n\nRow4:2\n\nThese elements:0,2,0,0,2. No majority of0 or8. Output is0.\n\nExample1's grid is5x7. Diagonal elements:\n\nRow0:0\n\nRow1:2\n\nRow2:8\n\nRow3:0\n\nRow4:0\n\nElements:0,2,8,0,0. Majority0. Output8. Doesn't fit.\n\nThis isn't working.\n\nAt this point, I'm not able to clearly identify the pattern. Given the time I've spent and the need to provide an answer, I'll make an educated guess based on the observations made earlier. The pattern that seems to hold for some examples is that the output is the number (0 or8) that is present in all rows containing [2,2] pairs. However, in some cases like example1, this doesn't hold. But given the test input's rows with [2,2] pairs all contain0, the output might be0.\n\nLooking at the test input's rows with [2,2] pairs:\n\nRow1: [0,0,0,8,2,2] \u2192 contains0 and8.\n\nRow2: [0,8,8,8,2,2] \u2192 contains0 and8.\n\nRow5: [8,2,2,0,0,8] \u2192 contains8 and0.\n\nRow6: [0,2,2,0,0,0] \u2192 contains0.\n\nAll these rows have0, so output0."
