        "cot_1": "Okay, let's tackle this puzzle. So, the problem is to figure out the pattern that transforms the input grids into the output grids. Let's look at the training examples first to understand what's going on.\n\nStarting with Example 0. The input is an 8x8 grid with some 8s. The output is a 3x6 grid. Wait, the output rows are shorter. Let me see the positions. The input has 8s in rows 1, 2, 3. Let's see their positions:\n\nRow 1: 8 at positions 1 and 2 (0-indexed)\nRow 2: 8 at position 1\nRow 3: 8 at positions 1,2,3\n\nThe output for Example 0 is three rows. Let me check the output rows:\n\nFirst output row: [8,8,0,8,8,0]\nSecond: [0,8,0,0,8,0]\nThird: [8,8,8,8,8,8]\n\nHmm, maybe each output row corresponds to a layer or a shifted version of the original. Alternatively, maybe it's a transformation where each input row is split into parts. Alternatively, maybe the output is taking non-zero elements from certain positions and rearranging them.\n\nLooking at Example 1's input: non-zero values are 2s. The output again is three rows of 6 elements each. The input's non-zero rows are row 5 (index 5) with a 2, row 6 with three 2s, row 7 with two 2s. The output rows are [0,2,0,0,2,0], [2,2,2,2,2,2], [2,2,0,2,2,0]. Wait, maybe each output row is combining elements from multiple input rows. Let me see.\n\nAnother approach: maybe the output is formed by taking certain columns from the input. For instance, in Example 0's input, the 8s are in columns 1,2 in row 1, column 1 in row 2, columns 1,2,3 in row3. Let's see how the output rows are formed. The first output row has 8,8,0,8,8,0. Maybe this is combining the first three rows' elements horizontally. Let's check row 1 of input: [0,8,8,0,0,0,0,0], row2: [0,0,8,0,0,0,0,0], row3: [0,8,8,8,0,0,0,0]. If we take columns 1-3 from each row and interleave them? For example, row1's columns 1-3 are 8,8,0. Row2's same columns are 0,8,0. Row3's are 8,8,8. If we interleave them, like 8 (row1 col1), 8 (row1 col2), 0 (row1 col3), 8 (row3 col1?), or maybe combine them in some way. Wait, the first output row is [8,8,0,8,8,0]. That's six elements. Maybe taking the first three elements of the non-zero rows and concatenating them. But the input rows are 8 elements each. Hmm, not sure.\n\nWait the output in example0 is three rows of 6 elements. The input is 8x8. Maybe the output is a compressed version. Let me think of each output row as combining two input rows. For instance, take rows 1 and 3 and combine them. Or perhaps take the non-zero rows and interleave their elements. Let's look at example0's input rows with non-zero elements:\n\nRow1: 0,8,8,0,0,0,0,0\nRow2: 0,0,8,0,0,0,0,0\nRow3:0,8,8,8,0,0,0,0\n\nThe output rows are:\n\n[8,8,0,8,8,0]\n[0,8,0,0,8,0]\n[8,8,8,8,8,8]\n\nLooking at the first output row: 8,8,0 comes from row1's columns 1,2,3 (since the values are 8,8,0), then 8,8,0 again? Wait row3's columns 1,2,3 are 8,8,8, but the output's first row ends with 8,8,0. Hmm, maybe not. Alternatively, maybe the output rows are formed by taking the non-zero elements from the input rows and shifting them. Alternatively, maybe each output row corresponds to a diagonal or a certain direction.\n\nAnother idea: the output rows might be the top three non-empty rows of the input, but transformed. For example, example0's non-empty rows are rows1,2,3. The output is three rows. Let's see:\n\nRow1 of input: columns 1-3 have 8,8,0. If we take those three elements and then look at another set. Wait the output first row is 8,8,0,8,8,0. That's two sequences of three. So maybe combining row1 and row3? Row1's columns 1-3 are 8,8,0, row3's columns 1-3 are 8,8,8. If we take first three elements from row1 and row3? But that would give 8,8,0,8,8,8, but the output is 8,8,0,8,8,0. Hmm, not matching. Maybe columns 1-3 from row1 and columns 1-3 from row2. Row1:8,8,0 and row2:0,8,0. Combining gives 8,8,0,0,8,0. But that's the second output row. Not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output rows are formed by taking three elements from each of two input rows. Let's check example0's first output row: 8,8,0,8,8,0. Let's see which input elements these correspond to. The first three elements (8,8,0) could be from row1's columns 1,2,3. Then the next three (8,8,0) might be from row3's columns 1,2,3? Row3's columns 1-3 are 8,8,8. So that doesn't fit. So maybe another approach.\n\nLooking at example1's input. The non-zero rows are row5 (index5) has a 2 at column3. Row6 (index6) has 2s at columns2,3,4. Row7 has 2s at columns2,3. Output rows are:\n\n[0,2,0,0,2,0]\n[2,2,2,2,2,2]\n[2,2,0,2,2,0]\n\nHmm, the first output row has two 2s separated by zeros. Let's see the input rows. Maybe the output is taking elements from specific positions. For example, row5's 2 is at (5,3) (assuming rows and columns are 0-indexed). Row6 has 2s at (6,2), (6,3), (6,4). Row7 has (7,2), (7,3). \n\nThe first output row of example1 is [0,2,0,0,2,0]. Maybe each pair of elements comes from different positions. For example, the first element 0 could be from row5, column2 (which is 0), then 2 from row5, column3. Then next elements 0 from row6, column1 (0), 0 from row6, column4 (0?), but row6 has a 2 at column4. Wait, not sure. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is constructed by taking the non-zero elements and arranging them in a certain pattern. For example, in example0, the 8s form a sort of shape. Let's visualize:\n\nRow1: positions 1,2\nRow2: position1\nRow3: positions1,2,3\n\nThis might form a T-shape. The output could be a rotated or compressed version. The output in example0 is three rows. Maybe each output row corresponds to a horizontal slice of the input shape but rotated or transformed. For example, the first output row could be the top of the T, then the middle, then the base. Alternatively, maybe it's a vertical stacking.\n\nAlternatively, the output could be a transposed version. Let's check. If the input is 8x8, the output is 3x6. Transposing would make it 8x8, which doesn't fit. So probably not.\n\nAnother idea: the output rows are created by collapsing the input grid into smaller rows. For example, merging two adjacent rows into one. Let's try example0:\n\nRow1 and row2: if we take elements from row1 and row2 in some way. For example, row1 has 8,8 in positions1,2. Row2 has 8 in position1. Merging them into a row that combines these. But how? The output rows are longer than the input rows. Wait, input rows are 8 elements, output rows are 6. So perhaps each output row is formed by combining elements from two input rows, selecting certain columns.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the non-zero elements from each column, but arranged in a certain way. Let's look at example0's columns. Columns 1 has 8 in rows1,3. Column2 has 8 in rows1,3. Column3 has 8 in rows2,3. The output has three rows. Maybe each row in the output represents a column from the input, but only the non-zero parts. But in example0's output, each row is 6 elements. Maybe combining two columns each? For example, columns1 and 2 in the input become the first two elements of each output row, but that's not clear.\n\nWait, maybe the output is the result of reading the input in a spiral or some other pattern. Let's see. For example0's input, the 8s form a sort of vertical line in the first few rows. The output rows are three lines. Let me think: example0's output rows are:\n\n[8,8,0,8,8,0]\n[0,8,0,0,8,0]\n[8,8,8,8,8,8]\n\nHmm, the third row is all 8s. Maybe the output is stacking the rows where each output row is a combination of the input rows' horizontal elements. For example, in example0, row1 and row3 might be combined. But how?\n\nAlternatively, considering that the output rows are shorter than the input's, perhaps they are centered or truncated. For example, taking the middle six columns of the input. But the input in example0 has non-zero elements in columns1-3. The output rows are six elements. If you take columns1-6 of the input, but in example0's row1, columns1-3 are 8,8,0 and the rest are 0. So [8,8,0,0,0,0], but the output row is [8,8,0,8,8,0]. So that doesn't match.\n\nWait, maybe the output is formed by combining the non-zero rows in a way that each output row is a shifted version of the input rows. For example, shifting each row to the left and overlapping them. Let's see:\n\nIn example0's input:\n\nRow1: [0,8,8,0,0,0,0,0] -> shift left by some amount? Maybe take the first three non-zero elements and then pad? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking each non-zero row, removing the zeros, and then combining them. For example, row1 in example0 is 0,8,8,0,0,0,0,0. The non-zero elements are [8,8]. But the output rows are longer. So that's probably not.\n\nAnother angle: the output rows in example0 and example1 have the same number of elements as the input's columns but maybe mirrored or transformed. For example, the output rows in example0 are 6 elements, which is the same as the input's columns (8) minus 2. Not sure.\n\nWait, maybe the output is a result of collapsing the 8x8 grid into a 3x6 grid by selecting certain rows and columns. For example, taking rows1,2,3 and columns1-6. Let's check:\n\nExample0's rows 1-3:\n\nRow1: 0,8,8,0,0,0,0,0 \u2192 columns1-6: 8,8,0,0,0,0\nRow2:0,0,8,0,0,0,0,0 \u2192 columns1-6: 0,8,0,0,0,0\nRow3:0,8,8,8,0,0,0,0 \u2192 columns1-6:8,8,8,0,0,0\n\nBut the output rows are [8,8,0,8,8,0], etc. Not matching. So maybe not.\n\nWait, let's look for the positions of the output elements. For example0's output:\n\nFirst row: [8,8,0,8,8,0]\n\nBreaking it into two parts: [8,8,0] and [8,8,0]. Maybe each part corresponds to a row. Like first three elements from row1, next three from row3. Row1's first three non-zero columns are 1,2 (8,8) then column3 is 0. So [8,8,0]. Row3's columns1-3 are 8,8,8. So if we take first three from row3, it's [8,8,8]. But the output is 8,8,0,8,8,0. Hmm. Not matching.\n\nAnother idea: the output rows are made by combining elements from different rows but same columns. For example, output row1 could be row1's columns1-3 followed by row3's columns1-3. So row1's [8,8,0] and row3's [8,8,8] would give [8,8,0,8,8,8], but the actual output is [8,8,0,8,8,0]. Not matching. So that's not it.\n\nLooking at example2's input and output. Input has 1s in row1 (columns5,6), row2 (column4), row3 (column5). Output rows are [0,1,1,0,1,1], [1,0,0,1,0,0], [0,1,0,0,1,0]. Hmm. So the first output row has two pairs of 1,1 separated by zeros. Maybe each pair comes from a different part of the input. For example, the first 1,1 could be from row1's columns5,6. The next 0,1,1 could be from row3's column5 (which is 1) but then where's the other 1? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output rows are mirror images. For example, the first output row in example0 is [8,8,0,8,8,0], which is symmetrical in the first and second three elements. Like the first three are 8,8,0 and the next three are 8,8,0 mirrored. Wait, 8,8,0 followed by 8,8,0. So maybe it's two copies? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking each non-zero element and placing it in a certain position in the output, considering their positions in the input. For instance, in example0, the 8s are in rows1-3 and columns1-3. The output has three rows, each with 6 elements. Perhaps each output row represents a combination of two input rows. For example, output row1 is row1 and row2 combined, output row2 is row2 and row3 combined, and row3 is row3 and row1 combined. But how?\n\nAlternatively, considering that the output rows are of length 6, perhaps each row is combining two input rows' elements. For example, in example0's output row1: [8,8,0,8,8,0]. If we take the first three elements from row1 (columns1-3:8,8,0) and the first three elements from row3 (8,8,8), but the output has 8,8,0 followed by 8,8,0. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is a convolution or some kind of neighbor count. For example, each element in the output is the sum of neighboring elements in the input. But looking at example0's output row3, all 8s. If the input has certain 8s, maybe their sum would be higher. But that seems unlikely.\n\nWait, let's look at the positions of the non-zero elements in each example and their outputs.\n\nIn example0's input:\n\nRow1: 8s at (1,1), (1,2)\nRow2: 8 at (2,2)\nRow3: 8s at (3,1), (3,2), (3,3)\n\nOutput:\n\nRow1: [8,8,0,8,8,0]\nRow2: [0,8,0,0,8,0]\nRow3: [8,8,8,8,8,8]\n\nHmm, the third output row has all 8s, which is six elements. Maybe it's a combination of all the input's 8s. But how? Alternatively, the output rows could be the sum of the input's rows in a certain way.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is a rotated version of the input's non-zero elements. For example, rotating the input 90 degrees and taking the non-zero parts. Let's see. Original input's non-zero part is a kind of vertical structure. Rotating it 90 degrees would make it horizontal. But the output has three rows, which is more than the width of the original.\n\nWait, let's try to see the positions. Example0's input 8s form a shape that might look like:\n\nRow1: ** (columns1-2)\nRow2:  * (column1)\nRow3: *** (columns1-3)\n\nIf we rotate this 90 degrees clockwise, the shape would be:\n\nColumn3: ** (rows1-2)\nColumn2: * (rows1)\nColumn1: *** (rows1-3)\n\nBut how does this translate to the output? The output's first row would then have three elements. But the output has six elements per row. So perhaps this is not the case.\n\nAnother approach: let's count the number of non-zero elements in each input and output. For example0's input has 2+1+3=6 non-zero 8s. The output has three rows with 8s. Let's count the 8s in the output:\n\nRow1: 4 (8s at 0,1,3,4)\nRow2: 2 (8s at 1,4)\nRow3:6 (all 8s)\nTotal: 4+2+6=12. But input has 6. So this doesn't add up. So maybe the output is not a direct count but some transformation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is a 2D representation of the input's non-zero elements when folded. For example, taking the input's non-zero elements and arranging them in a different grid. But I'm not sure.\n\nLooking at example2's input. The non-zero elements are:\n\nRow1: columns5,6 \u2192 1s\nRow2: column4 \u21921\nRow3: column5\u21921\n\nOutput rows:\n\n[0,1,1,0,1,1]\n[1,0,0,1,0,0]\n[0,1,0,0,1,0]\n\nHmm, the first output row has 1s at positions1,2,4,5. The second row has 1s at positions0 and3. The third row has 1s at positions1 and4. Maybe the output rows are encoding the positions of the 1s in the input.\n\nFor example, in the input's row1 (index1), columns5 and6 are 1s. In the output's first row, positions1 and2 (if 0-indexed) are 1s. Then, maybe the next two 1s at positions4 and5. So perhaps each pair of elements in the output corresponds to a row in the input.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is a combination of the columns where the non-zero elements appear. For example, in example0, the 8s are in columns1,2,3. The output's rows have elements that repeat in those columns. But how?\n\nAlternatively, considering that the output rows are three rows, maybe they represent the non-zero rows of the input but processed. For example, each output row corresponds to one of the non-zero rows in the input. But in example0, there are three non-zero input rows (1,2,3) and three output rows. Let's check:\n\nExample0's input row1: [0,8,8,0,0,0,0,0]\nOutput row1: [8,8,0,8,8,0]\n\nMaybe output row1 is combining input row1 and row3. Or perhaps shifting the elements. If we take row1's elements and shift them left by one, we get [8,8,0,0,0,0,0,0], but the output row is longer.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is created by duplicating the non-zero elements and arranging them in a pattern. For example, the first output row in example0 has 8,8,0, followed by 8,8,0. So it's like the same triplet repeated. But input row1's triplet is 8,8,0, and row3's is 8,8,8. Not matching.\n\nAnother idea: Maybe the output rows are the result of taking the maximum value from certain overlapping regions in the input. For example, if the input is divided into 2x3 regions and the max is taken. But the input is 8x8, which would not divide evenly into 2x3 regions. Alternatively, using a sliding window. But I'm not sure.\n\nWait, the output dimensions for each example are 3 rows of 6 elements. So 3x6. The inputs are 8x8. Maybe the output is a transformation that compresses each pair of input rows into a single output row by taking elements from columns 1-6, skipping some. But example0's input has non-zero elements in columns1-3. If the output is taking columns1-6 from each of the non-zero rows, but then how do the output rows get formed?\n\nLet's try example0 again. Input rows1-3 are:\n\nRow1: [0,8,8,0,0,0,0,0]\nRow2: [0,0,8,0,0,0,0,0]\nRow3: [0,8,8,8,0,0,0,0]\n\nIf we take columns1-6 of these rows:\n\nRow1:8,8,0,0,0,0\nRow2:0,8,0,0,0,0\nRow3:8,8,8,0,0,0\n\nBut the output rows are different. Example0's output rows are:\n\n[8,8,0,8,8,0]\n[0,8,0,0,8,0]\n[8,8,8,8,8,8]\n\nHmm. The third output row is all 8s, which doesn't match any of the input rows. So that approach doesn't work.\n\nLet me think differently. The output rows have 6 elements. The input is 8 columns. Maybe each output element is formed by combining two adjacent columns from the input. For example, summing or taking max of two columns. Let's check example0's first output row.\n\nInput row1's columns1-6:8,8,0,0,0,0. If we take pairs (8+8, 0+0, 0+0) \u2192 16,0,0. Not matching. Or maybe taking every other column. For example, columns1,3,5:8,0,0. But output is 8,8,0,8,8,0.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each output row is combining two input rows by interleaving their elements. For example, take row1 and row3, then alternate elements from each. For row1 (columns1-6):8,8,0,0,0,0. Row3 (columns1-6):8,8,8,0,0,0. Interleaving them would give:8,8,8,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0. Not matching the output row of six elements.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by reading the input in a specific order, such as reading columns vertically and taking non-zero elements. Let's see example0's columns:\n\nColumns1 in input rows1-3:8,0,8 \u2192 maybe becomes 8,0,8\nColumn2:8,8,8 \u2192 8,8,8\nColumn3:0,0,8 \u21920,0,8\n\nBut how does that form the output rows? The third output row is all 8s, which could be column2's values. But the first output row has 8,8,0,8,8,0. If we take columns1 and2's values from rows1-3 and arrange them in a way, but not sure.\n\nAnother observation: in each example, the output has the same number as the input. Like example0 has 8s, example1 has 2s, example2 has 1s. The test input has 3s. So whatever the transformation is, it preserves the number but changes the positions.\n\nLet's look at the output rows for example1:\n\nOutput:\n\n[0,2,0,0,2,0]\n[2,2,2,2,2,2]\n[2,2,0,2,2,0]\n\nThe input's non-zero rows are 5,6,7. Row5:2 at column3. Row6:2,2,2 at columns2-4. Row7:2,2 at columns2-3.\n\nThe output rows have 2s arranged in a pattern. The third output row has 2,2,0,2,2,0. Which could correspond to row7's 2,2 followed by row5's 2. But not sure.\n\nWait, maybe the output is formed by taking the non-zero elements from each input row and padding them with zeros to make a certain length, then stacking them. For example, in example0:\n\nRow1 has two 8s \u2192 [8,8,0,0,0,0] but output row1 is [8,8,0,8,8,0]. So that's not matching.\n\nAnother idea: the output is the result of taking each non-zero input row, reversing it, and appending it to itself. For example, row1 in example0: [0,8,8,0,0,0,0,0]. Reversed: [0,0,0,0,0,8,8,0]. Combining original and reversed might give 16 elements. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is created by taking the first three non-zero rows of the input and for each, taking the first three non-zero elements and the last three non-zero elements. But example0's row1 has two non-zero elements.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each output row is a combination of two input rows shifted and overlapped. For example, row1 and row2 shifted left and combined. But I'm not seeing it.\n\nWait, looking at the test input:\n\nTest Input:\n\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n[0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0]\n[0,3,3,3,0,0,0,0]\n[0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nThe non-zero rows are row4 (3 at column3), row5 (columns1,2,3 have 3s), row6 (column1 has 3). So similar to example0's structure but with 3s. So applying the same transformation, the output should have three rows, each with 6 elements, 3s arranged according to the pattern.\n\nIf example0's input (which has 8s in rows1,2,3) outputs a certain pattern, then the test input's rows4,5,6 (with 3s) should output a similar pattern but with 3s.\n\nLooking at example0's output:\n\nRow0: [8,8,0,8,8,0]\nRow1: [0,8,0,0,8,0]\nRow2: [8,8,8,8,8,8]\n\nThe test input's non-zero rows are:\n\nRow4: [0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0] \u2192 3 at column3\nRow5: [0,3,3,3,0,0,0,0] \u2192 columns1,2,3\nRow6: [0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0] \u2192 column1\n\nFollowing the pattern from example0, the output would have three rows:\n\nFirst row: [3,3,0,3,3,0]\nSecond row: [0,3,0,0,3,0]\nThird row: [3,3,3,3,3,3]\n\nBut wait, example0's first output row combines elements from row1 and row3. If in the test input, row4 has 3 at column3, row5 has 3s at 1,2,3, and row6 has 3 at 1. Then applying the same pattern:\n\nFirst output row could be row5's columns1-3 (3,3,3) followed by row5's columns1-3 again, but example0's first output row has [8,8,0,8,8,0]. Wait, in example0's first output row, the first three elements are from row1 (8,8,0) and the next three from row3 (8,8,8), but the output is 8,8,0,8,8,0. So maybe it's row1's columns1-3 and row3's columns1-3 with some modification. Or perhaps it's row1 and row3 but taking every other element.\n\nAlternatively, in example0's first output row, the first three elements are 8,8,0 (row1's columns1-3) and the next three are 8,8,0 again, which doesn't match any row. So perhaps it's a mirrored version. So the first three elements are 8,8,0 and then mirrored to 8,8,0. But why?\n\nAlternatively, maybe each output row is a combination of two input rows' elements, with the second part being a reflection. For example, row1's elements followed by row3's elements reversed. But not sure.\n\nAnother observation: in example0's output, the third row is all 8s, which is six elements. The input's row3 has three 8s. So perhaps the third output row is repeating the 8s twice. Like [8,8,8,8,8,8] which is exactly that. So in the test input's row5, which has three 3s, the third output row would be [3,3,3,3,3,3].\n\nSimilarly, example1's third output row is [2,2,0,2,2,0]. Which could be combining two parts of the input's row7 (2,2) and row5 (2), but not exactly. But in example1's third output row, the first three elements are 2,2,0 and the next three are 2,2,0. So it's a mirrored version. Perhaps each output row is mirrored. For example, the first half is mirrored in the second half.\n\nLooking at example0's first output row: [8,8,0,8,8,0]. The first three elements are 8,8,0 and the next three are 8,8,0. So mirrored. Similarly, the second output row is [0,8,0,0,8,0]. The first three are 0,8,0 and the next three are 0,8,0. So mirrored again. The third output row is all 8s, which is naturally mirrored.\n\nExample1's first output row: [0,2,0,0,2,0] \u2192 mirrored. Second output row: [2,2,2,2,2,2] \u2192 mirrored. Third: [2,2,0,2,2,0] \u2192 mirrored.\n\nExample2's output rows:\n\n[0,1,1,0,1,1] \u2192 mirrored? The first three are 0,1,1 and the next three are 0,1,1. Yes, mirrored.\n\nSecond row: [1,0,0,1,0,0] \u2192 mirrored. Third row: [0,1,0,0,1,0] \u2192 the first three are 0,1,0, next three are 0,1,0. But the output is [0,1,0,0,1,0]. Wait, that's not mirrored. The first three are 0,1,0. The next three are 0,1,0. So if you split into two parts, they are the same. So maybe the output rows are formed by taking a three-element sequence and repeating it.\n\nSo the pattern seems to be that each output row is a three-element sequence followed by its mirror (if mirrored) or the same sequence again.\n\nSo for each input's non-zero rows, we take a three-element sequence and duplicate it to form a six-element row.\n\nBut how to determine the three-element sequence from the input.\n\nIn example0's input:\n\nThe non-zero rows are 1,2,3.\n\nRow1: 0,8,8,0 \u2192 columns1-3: 8,8,0.\n\nRow2:0,0,8,0 \u2192 columns1-3:0,8,0.\n\nRow3:0,8,8,8 \u2192 columns1-3:8,8,8.\n\nThe output rows are:\n\nRow0: [8,8,0,8,8,0] \u2192 8,8,0 followed by 8,8,0. So it's row1's columns1-3 (8,8,0) duplicated.\n\nRow1: [0,8,0,0,8,0] \u2192 row2's columns1-3 (0,8,0) duplicated.\n\nRow2: [8,8,8,8,8,8] \u2192 row3's columns1-3 (8,8,8) duplicated, but since it's three elements, duplicated gives six.\n\nWait, row3's columns1-3 are 8,8,8. Duplicated would be 8,8,8,8,8,8. Which matches the output's third row.\n\nSo this seems to fit. So the pattern is:\n\nFor each of the three non-zero rows in the input (assuming there are three), take the first three elements of that row (columns1-3, 0-indexed), and then duplicate them to form a six-element row by repeating the three elements.\n\nWait, example0's input row1's first three elements (columns0-2, assuming 0-indexed) are 0,8,8. But the output row0 starts with 8,8,0. So maybe columns1-3 (indices1,2,3). Let's check:\n\nRow1 (input example0): [0,8,8,0,0,0,0,0]. Columns1-3: 8,8,0. So taking these three elements and repeating gives 8,8,0,8,8,0. Which matches the output's first row.\n\nRow2's columns1-3 are 0,8,0. Repeating gives 0,8,0,0,8,0. Which matches the second output row.\n\nRow3's columns1-3:8,8,8. Repeating gives 8,8,8,8,8,8. Matches third output row.\n\nYes! That seems to fit.\n\nLet's check example1:\n\nInput rows with non-zero values are row5,6,7.\n\nRow5: [0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0]. Columns1-3:0,0,2. But wait, columns1-3 are indices1,2,3. So columns1-3 are 0,0,2. Repeating gives 0,0,2,0,0,2. But the first output row is [0,2,0,0,2,0]. Hmm, that's different.\n\nWait maybe the columns are 0-indexed. Let me recheck:\n\nRow5 in example1's input is:\n\n[0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0]\n\nColumns0-7:\n\n0:0, 1:0, 2:0, 3:2, 4:0, etc.\n\nSo columns1-3 are indices1,2,3 \u2192 0,0,2. So the three elements are 0,0,2. Repeating would give 0,0,2,0,0,2. But the first output row in example1 is [0,2,0,0,2,0]. Which is different.\n\nHmm, this contradicts the previous hypothesis.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the columns are taken from different positions. For example, the three elements are columns2-4. Let's see:\n\nRow5's columns2-4:0,2,0. Repeating would give 0,2,0,0,2,0. Which matches example1's first output row [0,2,0,0,2,0].\n\nRow6: [0,0,2,2,2,0,0,0]. Columns2-4:2,2,2. Repeating \u2192 2,2,2,2,2,2. Which matches the second output row.\n\nRow7: [0,0,2,2,0,0,0,0]. Columns2-4:2,2,0. Repeating \u2192 2,2,0,2,2,0. Which matches the third output row.\n\nSo in example1, the three non-zero rows are 5,6,7. For each row, columns2-4 are taken, then repeated. This explains the output.\n\nSimilarly, let's check example2.\n\nExample2's non-zero rows are row1,2,3.\n\nRow1: [0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0]. Columns4-6 (assuming 0-indexed columns are 0-7). Columns4-6:0,1,1. Repeating gives 0,1,1,0,1,1. Which matches the first output row.\n\nRow2: [0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0]. Columns4-6:1,0,0. Repeating \u21921,0,0,1,0,0. Which matches the second output row.\n\nRow3: [0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0]. Columns4-6:0,1,0. Repeating \u21920,1,0,0,1,0. Which matches the third output row.\n\nSo the pattern seems to be:\n\nFor each of the three non-zero rows in the input (assuming there are three such rows), take the three elements starting from column4 (i.e., columns4,5,6) and repeat them to form a six-element row.\n\nWait, no. Because in example0's input, the non-zero rows are 1,2,3. Let's see:\n\nRow1: [0,8,8,0,0,0,0,0]. Columns4-6 would be 0,0,0. But example0's first output row is [8,8,0,8,8,0]. So that doesn't fit. So maybe the columns taken are different for each example.\n\nWait, there's inconsistency here. In example0, the columns taken were 1-3 (indices1,2,3) and repeated. In example1, columns2-4 (indices2,3,4) and repeated. In example2, columns4-6 (indices4,5,6) and repeated. So the starting column varies. This can't be.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the columns taken are those where the non-zero elements are concentrated. For example0, the 8s are in columns1-3. So taking columns1-3. Example1's non-zero elements in rows5,6,7 are columns3 (row5), columns2-4 (row6), and columns2-3 (row7). So the main columns are 2-4. Example2's non-zero elements are in columns5-6 (row1), column4 (row2), column5 (row3). So columns4-6.\n\nSo it's possible that the three columns taken are the leftmost, middle, and rightmost of the non-zero elements. But this seems too vague.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the three columns are determined by the first occurrence of the non-zero element in each row. For example, in example0's row1, the first non-zero is at column1, so columns1-3. In example1's row5, first non-zero is at column3, so columns3-5. But example1's output first row is [0,2,0,0,2,0], which would correspond to columns2-4 (0,2,0). Hmm, this is confusing.\n\nWait, let's re-examine example0's first output row: [8,8,0,8,8,0]. The three elements 8,8,0 are from row1's columns1,2,3. Then repeated. So in example0, for each non-zero row, the columns taken are the first three columns where the non-zero elements start. Row1 starts at column1, so columns1-3. Row2 starts at column2 (since the first non-zero is column2?), but row2 has 8 at column2 (index2). So columns2-4? Wait, no. Row2's non-zero is at column2 (index2). So perhaps columns2-4 would be 8,0,0, but that doesn't match the output.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the columns are centered around the first non-zero element in the row. For example, in example0's row1: first non-zero at column1, take columns0-2 (but that would be 0,8,8). But the output row starts with 8,8,0. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, for each non-zero row, take the three consecutive columns starting from the leftmost non-zero element. For example:\n\nRow1 in example0 has non-zero at columns1 and2. Leftmost is column1. So take columns1-3 (8,8,0).\n\nRow2 has non-zero at column2. Take columns2-4 (8,0,0). But example0's output for row2 is [0,8,0,0,8,0]. So if columns2-4 are 8,0,0, repeating gives 8,0,0,8,0,0. Which doesn't match. So this approach is incorrect.\n\nWait, but in example0's row2, the only non-zero is at column2. So if we take columns1-3 (0,8,0), which matches the output row's first three elements [0,8,0]. Repeating gives [0,8,0,0,8,0], which matches the output. So perhaps for each non-zero row, take columns1-3 (indices1,2,3) and repeat.\n\nIn example0:\n\nRow1: columns1-3 \u21928,8,0 \u2192 repeat \u2192 8,8,0,8,8,0.\n\nRow2: columns1-3 \u21920,8,0 \u2192 repeat \u21920,8,0,0,8,0.\n\nRow3: columns1-3 \u21928,8,8 \u2192 repeat \u21928,8,8,8,8,8.\n\nYes, this works for example0.\n\nIn example1, the non-zero rows are 5,6,7.\n\nRow5: [0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0]. Columns1-3:0,0,0. But the output's first row is [0,2,0,0,2,0]. So this doesn't fit.\n\nHmm, so perhaps the columns taken vary per example. Which is confusing.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the columns taken are determined by the position of the non-zero elements in the input rows. For example, in example0's row1, the non-zero elements are columns1-2, so take those and add the next column (which is 0). So columns1-3. For row2, non-zero is column2, so take columns1-3 (0,8,0). For row3, non-zero columns1-3. So that's why it works.\n\nIn example1's row5: non-zero is at column3. So take columns2-4 (0,2,0) which gives the first three elements of the first output row (0,2,0), then repeat to get (0,2,0,0,2,0). But columns2-4 of row5 are 0,2,0. Yes, that matches.\n\nRow6 in example1: columns2-4 are 2,2,2. Repeat \u21922,2,2,2,2,2. Matches the second output row.\n\nRow7 in example1: columns2-4 are 2,2,0. Repeat \u21922,2,0,2,2,0. Matches the third output row.\n\nYes! So for each non-zero row, we take columns (current non-zero column -1), current, and current +1. For example, if the non-zero element is at column3 (index3), then we take columns2-4 (indices2-4). So in row5 of example1, the non-zero is at column3, so take columns2-4 (0,2,0). In row6, non-zero columns are 2-4 (indices2-4), so take columns2-4 (2,2,2). In row7, non-zero columns are 2-3 (indices2-3), so take columns2-4 (2,2,0).\n\nSimilarly, example0's row1 has non-zero columns1-2. Taking columns1-3 (indices1-3) gives 8,8,0. Row2 has non-zero column2 \u2192 take columns1-3 (0,8,0). Row3 has non-zero columns1-3 \u2192 take columns1-3 (8,8,8).\n\nExample2's non-zero rows:\n\nRow1: non-zero at columns5-6 (indices5-6). So columns4-6 (indices4-6:0,1,1) \u2192 0,1,1.\n\nRow2: non-zero at column4 (index4). So take columns3-5 (index3-5:0,1,0). But row2's columns3-5 are 0 (index3), 1 (index4), 0 (index5). So columns3-5:0,1,0. Repeating gives 0,1,0,0,1,0. But example2's second output row is [1,0,0,1,0,0]. Hmm, doesn't match.\n\nWait, example2's row2: [0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0]. The non-zero is at column4 (index4). So columns3-5 (index3-5:0,1,0). Repeating gives 0,1,0,0,1,0. But example2's second output row is [1,0,0,1,0,0]. This doesn't fit.\n\nHmm, this suggests that the previous hypothesis is incorrect.\n\nAlternative approach for example2:\n\nRow1's non-zero is columns5-6 (indices5-6). So take columns5-6 and the next column (but that's 0). So columns5-6-7:1,1,0. Repeating gives 1,1,0,1,1,0. But example2's first output row is [0,1,1,0,1,1]. Which is different.\n\nAlternatively, take the three columns starting from the first non-zero column. For row1, first non-zero is column5. So columns5-7 (1,1,0). Repeating gives 1,1,0,1,1,0. Not matching.\n\nExample2's first output row is [0,1,1,0,1,1]. Which is 0,1,1 followed by 0,1,1. So maybe the three elements are columns4-6:0,1,1. Which are indices4-6 of row1:0,1,1. Repeating gives 0,1,1,0,1,1. Which matches.\n\nRow2 in example2: [0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0]. The non-zero is at column4. So columns4-6 are 1,0,0. Repeating gives 1,0,0,1,0,0. Which matches the second output row.\n\nRow3 in example2: [0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0]. The non-zero is at column5. So columns5-7:1,0,0. Repeating gives 1,0,0,1,0,0. But example2's third output row is [0,1,0,0,1,0]. Which is 0,1,0 followed by 0,1,0. So columns4-6:0,1,0. Repeating gives 0,1,0,0,1,0. Which matches.\n\nSo for example2, the three columns are4-6 for each non-zero row. \n\nSo the pattern seems to be that for each non-zero row, the three columns taken are those that include the non-zero elements, centered around the first occurrence of the non-zero element. But how to determine the exact columns.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for each non-zero row, the three columns taken are the columns that contain the non-zero elements, and if there are less than three, pad with zeros. But this varies.\n\nAlternatively, the columns taken are such that the three-element window is centered around the first non-zero element in the row. If the first non-zero element is at position i, the window is i-1, i, i+1. If the first non-zero is at the start, then take i, i+1, i+2.\n\nFor example:\n\nExample0's row1: first non-zero at index1 (8). So window is 0,1,2. But the columns taken are 1-3 (indices1,2,3). Hmm, maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, the window is centered around the first non-zero element. If the first non-zero is at index1, the window is index1-1, index1, index1+1. But index1-1 would be 0, which is zero. So the window would be 0,1,2. But example0's row1's columns0-2 are 0,8,8. But the output's first three elements are 8,8,0. So that doesn't fit.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Let me summarize the patterns:\n\n- For each of the three non-zero rows in the input, take three consecutive columns that contain the non-zero elements, then repeat the sequence to form a six-element row.\n\n- The columns taken vary per example. For example0, it's columns1-3. For example1, columns2-4. For example2, columns4-6.\n\n- The commonality is that the columns taken are those where the non-zero elements are concentrated. For each non-zero row, the three columns are chosen such that they cover the non-zero elements in that row. Then, these three elements are repeated to form a six-element row.\n\nBut how to determine which three columns to take for each row.\n\nIn example0:\n\nRow1: non-zero at columns1 and 2. So columns1-3 (8,8,0).\n\nRow2: non-zero at column2. So columns1-3 (0,8,0).\n\nRow3: non-zero at columns1,2,3. So columns1-3 (8,8,8).\n\nExample1:\n\nRow5: non-zero at column3. So columns2-4 (0,2,0).\n\nRow6: non-zero at columns2-4. So columns2-4 (2,2,2).\n\nRow7: non-zero at columns2-3. So columns2-4 (2,2,0).\n\nExample2:\n\nRow1: non-zero at columns5-6. So columns5-6 and 7 (0). But example2's row1's columns4-6 are 0,1,1. Wait, row1 in example2 is [0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0]. So columns4-6:0,1,1.\n\nRow2: non-zero at column4. So columns3-5:0,1,0.\n\nRow3: non-zero at column5. So columns4-6:0,1,0.\n\nSo in each case, the three columns are centered around the first non-zero element in the row. For example:\n\nRow5 of example1: first non-zero is at column3. Columns2-4 (left, current, right).\n\nRow1 of example2: first non-zero at column5. Columns4-6 (left, current, right).\n\nRow4 of test input: non-zero at column3. So columns2-4. Let's see:\n\nTest input's non-zero rows:\n\nRow4: [0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0] \u2192 non-zero at column3. Columns2-4:0,3,0. Repeated \u21920,3,0,0,3,0. So first output row would be [0,3,0,0,3,0].\n\nRow5: [0,3,3,3,0,0,0,0]. Non-zero at columns1-3 (3,3,3). So columns1-3:3,3,3. Repeated \u21923,3,3,3,3,3. So second output row.\n\nRow6: [0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0]. Non-zero at column1. So columns0-2:0,3,0. Repeated \u21920,3,0,0,3,0. But wait, example0's row2 had non-zero at column2 and used columns1-3. So following that pattern, row6's non-zero is at column1. So columns0-2:0,3,0. But then repeating gives 0,3,0,0,3,0. But the third output row in the test case should be similar to example0's third row. But example0's third row was all 8s. In test case's row5's columns1-3 are 3,3,3. So repeated gives all 3s. Then, row6's columns0-2:0,3,0. Repeated gives 0,3,0,0,3,0. But the third output row would be this.\n\nWait, but the test input's non-zero rows are row4,5,6. Let's list them:\n\nRow4: [0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0] \u2192 non-zero at column3 (index3). So columns2-4:0,3,0. Repeated \u21920,3,0,0,3,0 \u2192 first output row.\n\nRow5: [0,3,3,3,0,0,0,0] \u2192 non-zero starts at column1 (3). So columns0-2:0,3,3. But columns1-3:3,3,3. So if columns1-3 are taken, repeated gives 3,3,3,3,3,3 \u2192 second output row.\n\nRow6: [0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0] \u2192 non-zero at column1. So columns0-2:0,3,0. Repeated \u21920,3,0,0,3,0 \u2192 third output row.\n\nBut according to example0's pattern, the output rows would be:\n\n[0,3,0,0,3,0] (row4)\n[3,3,3,3,3,3] (row5)\n[0,3,0,0,3,0] (row6)\n\nBut looking at example0's output, the first row is from row1, second from row2, third from row3. So in test case, the output rows would be:\n\nFirst: row4's columns2-4 \u21920,3,0 \u2192 repeated \u2192 [0,3,0,0,3,0]\n\nSecond: row5's columns1-3 \u21923,3,3 \u2192 repeated \u2192 [3,3,3,3,3,3]\n\nThird: row6's columns0-2 \u21920,3,0 \u2192 repeated \u2192 [0,3,0,0,3,0]\n\nBut looking at the training examples, the order of the output rows corresponds to the order of the input rows. Example0's non-zero rows are rows1,2,3, and the output rows are in the same order. So the test input's non-zero rows are row4,5,6. So the output rows should be based on row4,5,6 in order.\n\nSo the output would be:\n\n[0,3,0,0,3,0] (from row4)\n\n[3,3,3,3,3,3] (from row5)\n\n[0,3,0,0,3,0] (from row6)\n\nBut looking at the training examples, example0's third output row is all 8s, which comes from row3's columns1-3. Similarly, test case's second output row would be all 3s. So the final output should be:\n\n[0,3,0,0,3,0]\n[3,3,3,3,3,3]\n[0,3,0,0,3,0]\n\nBut let me check if this aligns with the training examples. For example1, the output's third row is from row7's columns2-4 (2,2,0) \u2192 repeated as [2,2,0,2,2,0]. Which matches the third output row.\n\nSo applying this to the test input:\n\nRow4: columns2-4 (0,3,0) \u2192 [0,3,0,0,3,0]\n\nRow5: columns1-3 (3,3,3) \u2192 [3,3,3,3,3,3]\n\nRow6: columns0-2 (0,3,0) \u2192 [0,3,0,0,3,0]\n\nThus, the final output should be:\n\n[0,3,0,0,3,0]\n\n[3,3,3,3,3,3]\n\n[0,3,0,0,3,0]\n\nBut wait, example0's third row was from row3's columns1-3 (8,8,8) \u2192 [8,8,8,8,8,8]. Similarly, the test case's row5's columns1-3 are 3,3,3 \u2192 repeated gives all 3s.\n\nSo the answer should be:\n\n[0,3,0,0,3,0]\n[3,3,3,3,3,3]\n[0,3,0,0,3,0]\n\nBut looking at the test input's row6: [0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0]. The non-zero is at column1 (index1). So columns0-2 are 0,3,0. So the third output row is [0,3,0,0,3,0].\n\nYes. So the final answer should be as described.",

        "cot_2": "Okay, let's see. I need to figure out the pattern that transforms the input grids into the output grids in the training examples. Then apply that pattern to the test input. Let's start by analyzing the training examples one by one.\n\nLooking at Example 0:\n\nThe input is an 8x8 grid. The non-zero entries are 8s in certain positions. The output is a 3x6 grid. Let me see where those 8s are in the input.\n\nInput rows:\nRow 1: [0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\nRow 2: [0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\nRow 3: [0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nOutput rows:\n[8,8,0,8,8,0]\n[0,8,0,0,8,0]\n[8,8,8,8,8,8]\n\nHmm. Maybe the output is constructed by combining certain rows and columns from the input. Let's check the positions.\n\nLooking at the input, the non-zero cells are in rows 1, 2, 3 (if we start counting from 0 or 1? Let's assume 0-based). Let's see the positions:\n\nRow 1 (second row) has 8s at columns 1,2.\nRow 2 has 8 at column 2.\nRow 3 has 8s at columns 1,2,3.\n\nThe output has three rows. The first output row is 8,8,0,8,8,0. Maybe this is combining parts of the input rows. Let's see. If I take the non-zero elements from the first three rows of the input and arrange them in a certain way.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is taking the non-zero elements and arranging them in a specific pattern. Let's look for a transformation. For example, maybe each row of the output corresponds to a certain pattern in the input.\n\nWait, the output has 3 rows and 6 columns. The input has 8 rows and 8 columns. The outputs are smaller. Let's see:\n\nIn example 0's output, the first row is [8,8,0,8,8,0]. The second is [0,8,0,0,8,0], third is all 8s. Maybe each output row is combining parts of the input rows. For instance, the first output row could be combining row 1 and row 3. Let's check:\n\nRow 1 of input: [0,8,8,0,...]\nRow 3 of input: [0,8,8,8,0,...]\n\nIf we take columns 1-3 from row 1 and columns 1-3 from row 3, maybe? But how does that become 6 elements? Let's see:\n\nMaybe each output row is a combination of two input rows. For example, the first two input rows contribute to the first output row, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is a compressed version where each row in the output is formed by taking the non-zero elements from certain rows and padding with zeros. Wait, but in example 0's output, the first row has 8,8,0,8,8,0. That's 6 elements. Let's see if that corresponds to the non-zero elements in the input's rows.\n\nLooking at input rows:\n\nRow 1: positions 1,2 (8s)\nRow 2: position 2\nRow 3: positions 1,2,3\nRow 4 and others are all zeros.\n\nIf we take rows 1, 2, and 3 from the input, maybe the output rows are formed by concatenating these rows' non-zero parts, but adjusted.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is a 3x6 grid where each row corresponds to the left half and right half of the input rows. Wait, the input is 8 columns. The output has 6 columns. Maybe the middle parts are taken? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking the non-zero elements from the input and arranging them in a certain way. For example, in example 0, the 8s form a sort of \"T\" shape. The output seems to be a 3x6 grid where each row has symmetrical patterns.\n\nWait, looking at the output rows in example 0:\n\nFirst row: 8,8,0,8,8,0 \u2014 it's two 8s, a 0, then two 8s and a 0. Symmetrical in the middle.\n\nSecond row: 0,8,0,0,8,0 \u2014 two 8s separated by zeros.\n\nThird row: all 8s.\n\nHmm. Maybe the output is a mirror image or some kind of reflection. For example, each row in the output is a combination of a row and its mirror. Let's think: if the input row is [0,8,8,0], mirroring would give [0,8,8,0], concatenated makes [0,8,8,0,0,8,8,0]. But that's 8 elements, not 6. Maybe taking parts of it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is formed by taking the non-zero regions and expanding them. For example, in example 0, the input's non-zero area is a small cluster, and the output is a larger pattern derived from it.\n\nAnother approach: Let's look at the positions of non-zero elements in the input and see how they map to the output.\n\nIn example 0's input:\n\nRow 1 (index 1) has 8s at columns 1 and 2.\n\nRow 2 (index 2) has an 8 at column 2.\n\nRow 3 (index 3) has 8s at columns 1,2,3.\n\nSo the non-zero elements form a sort of T-shape: the top row has two 8s, the middle row has one, and the third row has three.\n\nThe output has three rows. The first output row has 8,8,0,8,8,0. That's two 8s, then 0, then two 8s and 0. Maybe this is combining two copies of the top row. The second output row has 0,8,0,0,8,0 \u2014 which could be the middle row duplicated. The third output row is all 8s, which could be the third row of the input expanded.\n\nWait, but how does that fit? Let's think.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each output row is a combination of two input rows. For example, the first output row is row1 and row3 of the input. Or maybe they're combining rows horizontally.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is a 3-row grid where each row is formed by taking the non-zero elements from the input's rows and padding them to form a symmetrical pattern. For example, the first output row in example0 is [8,8,0,8,8,0]. If we split this into two halves, each half is [8,8,0] and [8,8,0], which are the same. So maybe each half is a copy of the non-zero elements from a certain part of the input.\n\nWait, the input's first row (row1) has 8s at positions 1 and 2. So [0,8,8,0,0,0,0,0]. If we take the first three columns (indices 0-2) of row1, we get [0,8,8]. Then perhaps mirroring this to get [8,8,0] and combining? Then if we mirror it, that would make [8,8,0], and then perhaps again for row3?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is created by taking the non-zero elements from each row, mirroring them, and combining. Let's check example0:\n\nInput row1 (after leading zeros): [8,8], then zeros. So mirrored would be [8,8] reversed? Not sure. Or perhaps the non-zero elements are mirrored and then padded.\n\nAlternatively, let's look at example1's input and output:\n\nExample1 input:\n\nRow5: [0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0]\nRow6: [0,0,2,2,2,0,0,0]\nRow7: [0,0,2,2,0,0,0,0]\n\nOutput:\n\n[0,2,0,0,2,0]\n[2,2,2,2,2,2]\n[2,2,0,2,2,0]\n\nThe output has three rows. The first output row has 0,2,0,0,2,0. The second is all 2s. The third is 2,2,0,2,2,0.\n\nLooking at the input rows:\n\nRow5 has a single 2 at column3.\n\nRow6 has 2s at columns2,3,4.\n\nRow7 has 2s at columns2,3.\n\nSo the output's first row could be combining elements from row5 and row7. For example, the first three columns and last three columns. But how?\n\nIn the first output row [0,2,0,0,2,0], perhaps each 2 comes from row5 and row7's positions. For example, the 2 in position1 (0-based) in the first part and position1 in the second part. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output rows are formed by taking the middle columns of the input's non-zero rows. For example, input rows 5,6,7 are the ones with non-zero elements. Let's see:\n\nRow5: column3 is 2.\n\nRow6: columns2-4 are 2s.\n\nRow7: columns2-3 are 2s.\n\nThe output rows have six elements. Maybe each output row is taking a certain part of the input rows and mirroring or duplicating.\n\nFor example, the first output row is [0,2,0,0,2,0]. This could be taking the 2 from row5 (column3) and placing it in positions 1 and 4, then mirroring? Maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, the output rows are constructed by taking each input row's non-zero elements and padding with zeros in a way that creates a symmetrical pattern. For example, in row5 of the input (example1), there's a single 2. Maybe the output first row is that 2 mirrored on both sides. So 0,2,0 | 0,2,0 \u2192 combined as [0,2,0,0,2,0]. That's possible.\n\nRow6 has three 2s. The output second row is all 2s. So if you mirror the three 2s, you get six 2s. That fits. Row7 has two 2s. If mirrored, it would be [2,2,0,2,2,0]. Which matches the third output row of example1.\n\nOh! Wait, that seems to fit. Let's check this hypothesis.\n\nIf for each input row that has non-zero elements, we take the non-zero part and mirror it (reverse and append) to form a six-element row.\n\nFor example, in example0's input:\n\nRow1 (after leading zeros): 8,8,0. Wait, but row1's non-zero elements are 8,8, followed by zeros. Wait, no. The input row1 is [0,8,8,0,0,0,0,0]. The non-zero elements are 8,8 (positions1 and2). So the non-zero part is two 8s. To make six elements, perhaps we take those two, reverse them (but they are same), then pad with zeros. Wait, but that would be 8,8, then mirrored gives 8,8 again. So combining them as 8,8,8,8 and then maybe adding zeros? But that's four elements. Not sure.\n\nWait, maybe the process is: take the non-zero elements from each input row, mirror them (reverse), then concatenate, then trim or pad to six elements.\n\nAlternatively, take the non-zero elements, then mirror them (append reversed) to make a symmetrical sequence. Then take the first six elements.\n\nLet's test this with example1's row5: [0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0]. The non-zero part is [2]. Mirroring would be [2] reversed (still [2]), then concatenating gives [2,2]. But the output's first row is [0,2,0,0,2,0]. Hmm. That doesn't fit. Alternatively, maybe pad with zeros on both sides.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each non-zero row in the input is centered in the output row. For example, in example1's row5, the 2 is at position3. The output row has six elements. The middle positions would be 2 and 3. So placing the 2 in position1 and 4 (if zero-based) would create symmetry.\n\nWait, example1's first output row is [0,2,0,0,2,0]. The 2s are at positions1 and4. That's two 2s separated by two zeros. If the original input's 2 is in column3, perhaps in the output, it's duplicated to positions1 and4. But why?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each output row is formed by taking the non-zero elements of the input row and placing them in a mirrored fashion across the output row. For example, the input's non-zero part is of length N, and mirrored to create a symmetric pattern. Let's see:\n\nExample1's row5 has one 2. So mirrored would be two 2s. But how to place them in six elements. If the non-zero part is length 1, then mirrored would be 2, then reverse gives 2, so concatenated is [2,2], then perhaps centered in a 6-element array. But [0,0,2,2,0,0] would be centered, but the output is [0,2,0,0,2,0], which is different.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output rows are formed by taking the non-zero elements from the input row, then duplicating them with some overlap. For example, in example0's row1: 8,8. Then duplicated as 8,8,0 followed by 8,8,0 \u2192 concatenated as [8,8,0,8,8,0], which matches the first output row. Similarly, row2 has 8 in the middle. So 0,8,0 mirrored would be 0,8,0,0,8,0. Which matches the second output row. Row3's non-zero elements are 8,8,8. Mirroring would be 8,8,8,8,8,8 (since it's already symmetric). Which matches the third output row. Oh! This seems to fit.\n\nLet's check this with example0:\n\nInput row1 (non-zero part): 8,8. To form a 3-element part, perhaps take 8,8 and add a zero (since original row has [0,8,8,0,...], the non-zero part is two 8s followed by a zero? Or perhaps the first three elements of the row are [0,8,8], then mirrored. Wait, the first three elements of row1 (input example0) are [0,8,8]. If mirrored (reverse), it becomes [8,8,0]. Then duplicate that to make six elements: [8,8,0,8,8,0], which is exactly the first output row. Similarly, row2: the first three elements are [0,0,8]. Reversed, it's [8,0,0]. Then duplicated: [8,0,0,8,0,0]. But the output's second row is [0,8,0,0,8,0]. Hmm, that's different. Wait, maybe taking the first three elements of the input row, then mirroring (reverse) and appending. For example, row2's first three elements are [0,0,8]. Reverse is [8,0,0]. So combining the original and reversed gives [0,0,8,8,0,0]. But the output's second row is [0,8,0,0,8,0]. Doesn't match. So maybe that's not the case.\n\nWait, let's look at example0's row2: [0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. The first three elements are [0,0,8], but in the output row2 of example0, the elements are [0,8,0,0,8,0]. So maybe each output row is formed by taking the first three elements and the last three elements of the input row. For row2, first three are [0,0,8], last three (of the row) are [0,0,0], but that's not matching. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for each row in the input that contains non-zero elements, take the first three elements and the last three elements, reverse them, and combine. Let's try example0's row1:\n\nFirst three elements: [0,8,8], last three elements (from the end) would be [0,0,0]. Reverse those? Maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, for each input row, extract the non-zero elements, pad them with zeros to make three elements, then mirror them to make six elements.\n\nFor example0's row1: non-zero elements are 8,8. Pad with zero to make three: 8,8,0. Mirror this to get 8,8,0,8,8,0. Which matches the first output row.\n\nRow2's non-zero elements: 8. Pad to three elements: 8,0,0. Mirror: 8,0,0 becomes 0,0,8. Combine with original: 8,0,0,0,0,8. But the output's second row is [0,8,0,0,8,0]. Doesn't match. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps the non-zero elements are centered. For example, row2 has one 8 in the third position (index2) of the input row. So, to create a three-element window around it? Let's see: the non-zero element is at position2. So the three elements would be positions1,2,3: [0,8,0]. Then mirroring that would be [0,8,0] reversed \u2192 [0,8,0], so combining gives [0,8,0,0,8,0], which matches the second output row. Oh! That makes sense.\n\nSo the process could be:\n\nFor each row in the input that contains non-zero elements:\n\n1. Take the three-element window centered on the first non-zero element in the row. Wait, but in some rows there might be multiple non-zero elements.\n\nWait, in example0's row1: the non-zero elements are positions1 and2. The three-element window would be positions0,1,2 \u2192 [0,8,8]. Then mirroring this window (reverse) gives [8,8,0]. Combine the original and reversed to form [0,8,8,8,8,0]. But the first output row is [8,8,0,8,8,0]. So maybe the three-element window is centered around the middle of the non-zero cluster.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for each row with non-zero elements, we take a three-element window starting from the first non-zero element. For example, row1: first non-zero is position1. Take elements1,2,3 \u2192 [8,8,0]. Then mirror that to get [0,8,8]. Combine them \u2192 [8,8,0,0,8,8], but that doesn't match the output.\n\nHmm, maybe it's better to look at how each output row corresponds to the input row.\n\nLooking at example0:\n\nInput row1 (8s at 1,2) \u2192 output row1: [8,8,0,8,8,0].\n\nIf the three-element window is [8,8,0], and mirrored (reverse) is [0,8,8], then combined it's [8,8,0,0,8,8]. But the output is [8,8,0,8,8,0]. That's different.\n\nAlternatively, take the three-element window around the first non-zero element. For row1, first non-zero at position1. Take positions0,1,2 \u2192 [0,8,8]. Reverse \u2192 [8,8,0]. Combine \u2192 [0,8,8,8,8,0]. That's length 6. But the output row is [8,8,0,8,8,0]. So this doesn't fit.\n\nWait, maybe the three-element window is taken from the start of the non-zero elements. For row1, the non-zero elements start at position1. So take positions1,2,3 \u2192 [8,8,0]. Reverse \u2192 [0,8,8]. Combine \u2192 [8,8,0,0,8,8]. Not matching output.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output row is formed by taking the non-zero elements and reflecting them symmetrically. For example, in example0's row1, the 8s are at positions1 and2. The output row has 8s at positions0,1,3,4. Which is a mirror around position2. So maybe the output row is a mirrored version of the non-zero elements, expanded to six elements.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is created by taking the non-zero elements of each row, mirroring them left and right, and then concatenating. For example, if the non-zero elements are [8,8], mirroring gives [8,8,8,8], but that's four elements. Need to reach six. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, think of the output as a 3x6 grid where each output row corresponds to a certain transformation of the input's non-zero row. For example, in example0, the three non-zero input rows (rows1,2,3) become three output rows.\n\nRow1 of input \u2192 row0 of output: [8,8,0,8,8,0].\n\nRow2 of input \u2192 row1 of output: [0,8,0,0,8,0].\n\nRow3 of input \u2192 row2 of output: [8,8,8,8,8,8].\n\nSo for each input row, take the non-zero elements, pad to three elements, mirror them, and then concatenate to form six elements.\n\nLet's see:\n\nRow1 (input): non-zero elements are positions1 and2 \u2192 [8,8]. Pad to three elements: [8,8,0]. Mirror this \u2192 [0,8,8]. Concatenate \u2192 [8,8,0,0,8,8]. But the output is [8,8,0,8,8,0]. Hmm, not matching.\n\nWait, maybe the mirroring is done on the three-element window. For example, take three elements from the input row where the non-zero elements are, then reverse that and append.\n\nRow1: the three elements around the non-zero could be positions1,2,3 \u2192 [8,8,0]. Reverse this \u2192 [0,8,8]. So concatenated \u2192 [8,8,0,0,8,8]. Not matching output [8,8,0,8,8,0].\n\nAlternatively, maybe the three elements are taken as positions0,1,2 \u2192 [0,8,8]. Reverse \u2192 [8,8,0]. Concatenate \u2192 [0,8,8,8,8,0]. Which is 0,8,8,8,8,0. Output row is 8,8,0,8,8,0. Doesn't match.\n\nHmm, this is tricky. Let's try example1's output row1: [2,2,2,2,2,2]. The input row6 has three 2s. So three elements would be [2,2,2]. Mirroring gives [2,2,2], so concatenated as [2,2,2,2,2,2], which matches.\n\nFor example1's row7: input row7 has two 2s. The three-element window could be [2,2,0]. Reverse \u2192 [0,2,2]. Concatenate \u2192 [2,2,0,0,2,2]. But the output's third row is [2,2,0,2,2,0]. So that doesn't fit. Wait, no. [2,2,0] reversed is [0,2,2], so combined it's [2,2,0,0,2,2]. Output is [2,2,0,2,2,0]. So maybe there's another step.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the three-element window is centered around the middle of the non-zero elements. For row7 in example1: the 2s are at positions2 and3. So the three elements would be positions2,3,4 \u2192 [2,2,0]. Reverse \u2192 [0,2,2]. Concatenated gives [2,2,0,0,2,2]. Output is [2,2,0,2,2,0]. Not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's taking the three elements including the non-zero and some surrounding zeros, then mirroring with overlap. For example, row7's non-zero are 2,2. Take [2,2,0], reverse \u2192 [0,2,2]. Concatenate \u2192 [2,2,0,0,2,2], but the output is [2,2,0,2,2,0]. Not matching.\n\nWait, the output's third row in example1 is [2,2,0,2,2,0]. If I split this into two parts: [2,2,0] and [2,2,0]. That's the same as the three-element window [2,2,0] mirrored. But then why is the mirroring the same as the original? That would happen if the window is symmetric. But [2,2,0] reversed is [0,2,2]. So not the same. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the three-element window is [0,2,2] from the input row7. Then reversed is [2,2,0]. Concatenated gives [0,2,2,2,2,0]. Which is [0,2,2,2,2,0], but the output is [2,2,0,2,2,0]. Doesn't fit.\n\nThis is getting a bit stuck. Let me think differently. The output rows in all examples have three rows, each corresponding to one of the non-zero input rows. Each output row is six elements long, which is double the three-element window. So perhaps for each non-zero input row, we take a three-element window and mirror it to create six elements.\n\nFor example0's row1: take [0,8,8] \u2192 mirror to get [8,8,0], then combine [0,8,8,8,8,0]. But the output is [8,8,0,8,8,0]. Hmm, not matching.\n\nAlternatively, take the three elements after the first non-zero element. For row1, non-zero starts at position1. Take elements1,2,3 \u2192 [8,8,0]. Mirror to [0,8,8], combine \u2192 [8,8,0,0,8,8]. Not matching.\n\nAlternatively, for each non-zero row in the input, the output row is the non-zero elements followed by their mirror image. For example, row1 in example0: non-zero elements are [8,8]. Mirror is [8,8]. So concatenated gives [8,8,8,8], then padded to six elements with zeros \u2192 [8,8,0,8,8,0]. Oh! This seems to fit.\n\nLet's test this:\n\nFor example0's row1: non-zero elements are [8,8]. Mirror (reverse) is [8,8]. Concatenate to get [8,8,8,8]. Now, to make six elements, we can add zeros at the end or split. Wait, the output is [8,8,0,8,8,0]. So [8,8] + [0] + [8,8] + [0]? Not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the non-zero elements are duplicated and interspersed with zeros. \n\nWait, if we have [8,8] and mirror, we get [8,8] again. So concatenated gives [8,8,8,8]. Then add a zero at the end and beginning? Not sure. But the output is [8,8,0,8,8,0]. That's six elements, with 8s at positions0,1,3,4. So perhaps the pattern is: mirror the non-zero elements and pad zeros in between. For example, non-zero elements [a,b] \u2192 mirrored [b,a], but since they're same, [a,b,a,b], but that's four elements. To get six, pad zeros at positions2 and5: [a,b,0,a,b,0]. Oh! That matches the first output row of example0.\n\nYes! Let's see:\n\nIn example0's row1, non-zero elements are [8,8]. The mirrored (reverse) is [8,8]. Then, interleave with zeros in the middle and end. So:\n\nOriginal: [8,8]\n\nMirror: [8,8]\n\nCombine as [8,8,0,8,8,0]. Exactly the output row.\n\nSimilarly, row2 of example0 has a single non-zero element [8]. Mirroring gives [8]. Combine them as [8,0,0,8,0,0]. But the output row is [0,8,0,0,8,0]. Hmm, that doesn't fit. So perhaps the process is to take the non-zero elements, then mirror them, but pad with zeros in between and at the ends to make six elements.\n\nWait, for a single element:\n\nNon-zero elements: [8]. Mirror is [8]. So combining them would be [8,8]. To make six elements, pad zeros in between. For example, [8,0,0,8,0,0]. But the output row is [0,8,0,0,8,0]. So maybe it's placed in the middle positions. For a single element, the middle positions are 2 and 3. But six elements have indices 0-5. Middle would be positions 2 and 3. So placing 8s there would be [0,0,8,8,0,0]. But output row is [0,8,0,0,8,0]. So positions1 and4. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, when the non-zero elements are of odd length, like single element, we place them in the middle. But for even length, split into two parts. This is getting complicated.\n\nWait, let's think again. For each non-zero row in the input:\n\n- Take the non-zero elements.\n\n- Mirror (reverse) them.\n\n- Concatenate the original and mirrored to form a new list.\n\n- Pad with zeros as needed to make six elements.\n\nWait, in example0's row1:\n\nNon-zero: [8,8]. Mirror: [8,8]. Concatenated: [8,8,8,8]. Need to make six elements. So pad two zeros: [8,8,8,8,0,0]. But the output is [8,8,0,8,8,0]. Doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, pad in the middle. For example, insert zeros between the original and mirrored parts.\n\nWait, perhaps it's not mirroring but duplicating the non-zero elements and adding zeros in between.\n\nFor example, row1's non-zero elements are [8,8]. Duplicate \u2192 [8,8,8,8]. Then insert a zero in the middle and at the end. Like [8,8,0,8,8,0]. Which matches.\n\nRow2's non-zero is [8]. Duplicate \u2192 [8,8]. Then insert zeros around: [0,8,0,0,8,0]. Which matches the output.\n\nRow3's non-zero elements are [8,8,8]. Duplicate \u2192 [8,8,8,8,8,8]. Which matches the output.\n\nThat seems to fit. So the pattern could be:\n\nFor each input row that has non-zero elements:\n\n- Take the non-zero elements.\n\n- Duplicate them (append a copy).\n\n- If the total length after duplication is less than 6, pad with zeros in between the original and duplicated parts to make the total length 6.\n\nWait, but in example0's row1: non-zero elements are two 8s. Duplicate gives four 8s. To make six elements, we need to add two zeros. But the output has zeros at positions2 and5. So inserting a zero between the two copies and one at the end.\n\nAlternatively, the pattern is to take the non-zero elements, duplicate them, then insert zeros between them. Let's see:\n\nRow1: [8,8] \u2192 duplicate \u2192 [8,8,8,8]. To make six elements, insert two zeros. Insert after the first two and after the next two \u2192 [8,8,0,8,8,0]. Which matches the output.\n\nRow2: [8] \u2192 duplicate \u2192 [8,8]. To make six elements, insert four zeros. But how? The output is [0,8,0,0,8,0]. So it's inserting a zero before each 8 and between them. So 0,8,0 and 0,8,0. Combining gives six elements. So for a single element, the pattern is to place it at positions1 and4, with zeros around.\n\nRow3: [8,8,8] \u2192 duplicate \u2192 [8,8,8,8,8,8]. Which is six elements. So no padding needed. Matches output.\n\nIn example1's row5: non-zero elements [2]. Duplicate \u2192 [2,2]. Insert zeros around each \u2192 [0,2,0,0,2,0]. Which matches the first output row.\n\nRow6: non-zero elements [2,2,2]. Duplicate \u2192 [2,2,2,2,2,2]. Matches the second output row.\n\nRow7: non-zero elements [2,2]. Duplicate \u2192 [2,2,2,2]. Need to pad two zeros. Inserting after the first two and at the end \u2192 [2,2,0,2,2,0]. Which matches the third output row.\n\nYes! This seems to fit all examples. So the pattern is:\n\nFor each input row that has non-zero elements:\n\n1. Take the non-zero elements.\n\n2. Duplicate them (append a copy of the non-zero elements).\n\n3. If the combined length (original + duplicate) is less than 6, insert zeros between the original and duplicate to reach a total length of 6.\n\n   - For even lengths:\n\n     - Original length 2 \u2192 duplicate gives 4 \u2192 add 2 zeros. Insert one zero between the two parts and one at the end? Wait, no. For example, row1's non-zero is 2 elements. Duplicate gives 4. Need 6 elements. So add two zeros. How? The output is [8,8,0,8,8,0], which suggests inserting one zero between the two pairs and one at the end. Wait, but [8,8] + [0] + [8,8] + [0] would be 8,8,0,8,8,0.\n\n   - For odd lengths:\n\n     - Original length 3 \u2192 duplicate gives 6. No need for zeros.\n\n     - Original length 1 \u2192 duplicate gives 2. Need 6 elements. Insert four zeros. How? The output for example0's row2 (single 8) is [0,8,0,0,8,0]. So it's placing the 8 at positions1 and4, with zeros around.\n\nSo the general rule is:\n\n- For each non-zero row in the input:\n\n   a. Extract the non-zero elements.\n\n   b. Duplicate this list.\n\n   c. Insert zeros between the original and duplicated parts, and at the end if needed, to make the total length 6.\n\nBut the exact insertion pattern needs to be determined.\n\nAlternatively, after duplicating, distribute the zeros evenly between the parts. For example:\n\n- For length 2 (non-zero elements):\n\n   Original: [a, b]\n\n   Duplicate: [a, b, a, b]\n\n   Need to add two zeros. So insert one zero after the first two elements and one at the end: [a, b, 0, a, b, 0].\n\n- For length 1 (non-zero element):\n\n   Original: [a]\n\n   Duplicate: [a, a]\n\n   Need to add four zeros. Insert two zeros after each 'a' and between them: [0, a, 0, 0, a, 0].\n\n- For length 3 (non-zero elements):\n\n   Original: [a, b, c]\n\n   Duplicate: [a, b, c, a, b, c] \u2192 length 6. No zeros needed.\n\nThis seems to align with the examples:\n\nExample0 row1 (length 2):\n\n[a=8, b=8] \u2192 [8,8,0,8,8,0].\n\nExample0 row2 (length1):\n\n[a=8] \u2192 [0,8,0,0,8,0].\n\nExample0 row3 (length3):\n\n[8,8,8] \u2192 [8,8,8,8,8,8].\n\nExample1 row5 (length1):\n\n[2] \u2192 [0,2,0,0,2,0].\n\nExample1 row6 (length3):\n\n[2,2,2] \u2192 [2,2,2,2,2,2].\n\nExample1 row7 (length2):\n\n[2,2] \u2192 [2,2,0,2,2,0].\n\nYes! This matches all the training examples.\n\nSo the pattern is:\n\nFor each non-empty row in the input (rows that have at least one non-zero element):\n\n1. Extract the non-zero elements (keeping their order).\n\n2. Duplicate this list.\n\n3. Insert zeros between the two copies and at the end to make the total length 6.\n\nThe number of zeros added depends on the length of the non-zero elements:\n\n- If original length is 1: after duplication, the combined length is 2. Need 4 zeros. Insert zeros around each element and between them: 0, a, 0, 0, a, 0.\n\n- If original length is 2: combined length is 4. Need 2 zeros. Insert one zero after the first copy and one at the end: a, b, 0, a, b, 0.\n\n- If original length is 3: combined length is 6. No zeros needed.\n\nThus, the steps are:\n\nFor each non-zero input row:\n\n- Take non-zero elements.\n\n- Duplicate them.\n\n- If the length of duplicated elements is:\n\n   - 2 \u2192 insert 4 zeros as per the pattern for single elements.\n\n   - 4 \u2192 insert 2 zeros between and at the end.\n\n   - 6 \u2192 use as is.\n\nNow, applying this to the test input.\n\nTest input:\n\nThe input is an 8x8 grid. Let's look for the rows with non-zero elements.\n\nThe test input:\n\nRow4: [0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0] \u2192 non-zero element 3 at column3.\n\nRow5: [0,3,3,3,0,0,0,0] \u2192 non-zero elements at columns1,2,3 (3,3,3).\n\nRow6: [0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0] \u2192 non-zero element at column1.\n\nSo the non-zero rows are rows4,5,6 (assuming rows are 0-indexed).\n\nProcessing each non-zero row:\n\nRow4:\n\nNon-zero elements: [3].\n\nDuplicate \u2192 [3,3].\n\nLength after duplication: 2 \u2192 need to insert 4 zeros. The pattern for length1 is [0, a, 0, 0, a, 0]. So the output row is [0,3,0,0,3,0].\n\nRow5:\n\nNon-zero elements: [3,3,3].\n\nDuplicate \u2192 [3,3,3,3,3,3]. Length6. So output row is [3,3,3,3,3,3].\n\nRow6:\n\nNon-zero elements: [3].\n\nDuplicate \u2192 [3,3].\n\nInsert zeros as per length1 pattern: [0,3,0,0,3,0].\n\nSo the output should have three rows:\n\n[0,3,0,0,3,0]\n\n[3,3,3,3,3,3]\n\n[0,3,0,0,3,0]\n\nWait, but let's check the order. The input rows with non-zero elements are row4, row5, row6. So in the output, they should appear in the same order as in the input. So first row4's output, then row5's, then row6's.\n\nSo the output would be:\n\nFirst output row: [0,3,0,0,3,0]\n\nSecond output row: [3,3,3,3,3,3]\n\nThird output row: [0,3,0,0,3,0]\n\nBut let's check the training examples. For example0, the input's non-zero rows are rows1,2,3. The output has three rows, each corresponding to those rows in order.\n\nSo the test input's non-zero rows are rows4,5,6. Thus, their outputs should be in the same order. Therefore, the three output rows would be:\n\nRow4 \u2192 [0,3,0,0,3,0]\n\nRow5 \u2192 [3,3,3,3,3,3]\n\nRow6 \u2192 [0,3,0,0,3,0]\n\nBut looking at the training examples, the order of the output rows matches the order of the input rows. For example, example1's non-zero rows are rows5,6,7. The output has three rows corresponding to those in order.\n\nSo the test input's output should be:\n\nFirst output row: row4's processed \u2192 [0,3,0,0,3,0]\n\nSecond output row: row5's processed \u2192 [3,3,3,3,3,3]\n\nThird output row: row6's processed \u2192 [0,3,0,0,3,0]\n\nBut wait, let's check the training examples again. For example2:\n\nInput has non-zero rows 1,2,3.\n\nOutput has three rows. Let's see:\n\nInput row1: non-zero elements [1,1] \u2192 output row0: [0,1,1,0,1,1] \u2192 which is [0,1,1] and [0,1,1], but according to our previous pattern, for length 2 (non-zero elements), the output should be [1,1,0,1,1,0]. But example2's output is [0,1,1,0,1,1]. Hmm, this contradicts our previous pattern.\n\nWait, example2's input:\n\nRow1: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0] \u2192 non-zero elements are [1,1].\n\nAccording to our pattern, duplicate \u2192 [1,1,1,1], then insert zeros between and at end: [1,1,0,1,1,0]. But the output is [0,1,1,0,1,1]. So this doesn't fit. So what's different here?\n\nHmm, this suggests that the previous pattern might not be correct.\n\nLooking back at example2:\n\nINPUT:\n\nRow1: [0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0] \u2192 non-zero elements at positions5 and6: [1,1].\n\nRow2: [0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0] \u2192 non-zero element at position4: [1].\n\nRow3: [0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0] \u2192 non-zero element at position5: [1].\n\nOUTPUT:\n\n[0,1,1,0,1,1]\n\n[1,0,0,1,0,0]\n\n[0,1,0,0,1,0]\n\nRow0 of output corresponds to row1 of input. The output row is [0,1,1,0,1,1]. According to our previous pattern, the non-zero elements are [1,1], duplicate to [1,1,1,1], then insert zeros to make six elements. According to previous pattern, it would be [1,1,0,1,1,0]. But the output is [0,1,1,0,1,1]. So the zeros are at positions0 and3, whereas our previous pattern would have them at positions2 and5.\n\nThis suggests that the previous pattern is not correct, and there's a different way of inserting zeros.\n\nSo there's a problem with the initial hypothesis. Let's re-examine example2.\n\nIn example2's row1 of input, non-zero elements are at positions5 and6: [1,1]. The output row is [0,1,1,0,1,1]. So the zeros are at positions0 and3. The duplicated elements are [1,1,0,1,1], but how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the non-zero elements are extracted and then mirrored, but taking into account their position in the input row. For example, in example2's row1, the non-zero elements are towards the end of the row. Maybe the three-element window includes those and some zeros before.\n\nFor example, the three-element window for row1 of example2 could be positions4,5,6: [0,1,1]. Then mirroring (reverse) gives [1,1,0]. Combine to get [0,1,1,1,1,0]. Which is not matching the output [0,1,1,0,1,1].\n\nAlternatively, take the three-element window starting from the first non-zero. For row1 of example2, first non-zero is at position5. So three elements would be positions5,6,7 \u2192 [1,1,0]. Reverse \u2192 [0,1,1]. Combine \u2192 [1,1,0,0,1,1]. Still not matching output.\n\nThis indicates that the previous pattern isn't correct, and there's a different mechanism at play.\n\nAlternative approach: Let's look at the output rows in the training examples and see if there's a common structure.\n\nLooking at example0's output:\n\n[8,8,0,8,8,0]\n\n[0,8,0,0,8,0]\n\n[8,8,8,8,8,8]\n\nEach row is symmetrical around the middle.\n\nSimilarly, example1's output:\n\n[0,2,0,0,2,0]\n\n[2,2,2,2,2,2]\n\n[2,2,0,2,2,0]\n\nAll rows are symmetrical.\n\nExample2's output:\n\n[0,1,1,0,1,1]\n\n[1,0,0,1,0,0]\n\n[0,1,0,0,1,0]\n\nEach row is symmetrical. For example, the first row is mirrored around the center (between positions2 and3). So the first three elements are [0,1,1], and the last three are [0,1,1] reversed \u2192 [1,1,0], but wait that doesn't match. Wait, the first row is [0,1,1,0,1,1]. If you split into two halves: [0,1,1] and [0,1,1]. They are the same. So the row is symmetrical by duplicating the first three elements.\n\nSimilarly, the second row [1,0,0,1,0,0]: split into [1,0,0] and [1,0,0], so symmetrical.\n\nThird row [0,1,0,0,1,0]: split into [0,1,0] and [0,1,0], but reversed. So it's symmetrical.\n\nSo each output row is a symmetrical pattern formed by a three-element sequence duplicated and reversed.\n\nSo perhaps each output row is formed by taking a three-element sequence from the input row, then appending its reverse to form six elements.\n\nBut how is the three-element sequence chosen?\n\nFor example0's row1 input: [0,8,8,0,0,0,0,0]. The three-element sequence could be [0,8,8], reversed is [8,8,0], concatenated gives [0,8,8,8,8,0]. But the output is [8,8,0,8,8,0]. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, the three-element sequence is [8,8,0], reversed is [0,8,8], concatenated \u2192 [8,8,0,0,8,8]. Output is [8,8,0,8,8,0]. Doesn't match.\n\nAlternatively, the three-element sequence is [8,8,0], and then mirrored to [0,8,8], giving [8,8,0,0,8,8]. No.\n\nAlternatively, the three-element sequence is the first three non-zero elements. But in example0's row1, there are two non-zero elements. So this doesn't work.\n\nThis is getting too complicated. Perhaps another approach: for each non-zero input row, the output row is formed by taking the three elements starting from the first non-zero element, then appending the reverse of those three elements.\n\nLet's test this:\n\nExample0's row1: non-zero starts at position1. Three elements are [8,8,0]. Reverse is [0,8,8]. Concatenated \u2192 [8,8,0,0,8,8]. Not matching output [8,8,0,8,8,0].\n\nNo. example0's row1 output is [8,8,0,8,8,0]. Which is three elements [8,8,0] and [8,8,0]. So it's the same sequence duplicated. But how?\n\nWait, in example0's row1 input: [0,8,8,0,0,0,0,0]. The first three elements are [0,8,8]. If we take that, duplicate it, and then perhaps trim to six elements: [0,8,8,0,8,8]. But output is [8,8,0,8,8,0]. Doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, take the three elements after the first non-zero. For row1, non-zero starts at position1. Take positions1,2,3 \u2192 [8,8,0]. Then duplicate reversed \u2192 [0,8,8]. Concatenated \u2192 [8,8,0,0,8,8]. Not matching.\n\nAlternatively, the output rows are formed by taking the non-zero elements and their surrounding zeros, then creating a symmetrical pattern. For example, example0's row1 has 8,8. The output row is [8,8,0,8,8,0], which is the non-zero elements padded with zeros to create symmetry.\n\nBut how to determine where to place the zeros.\n\nAnother observation: in all output rows, the non-zero elements are placed symmetrically. For example, in example0's row1 output: 8s at positions0,1,3,4. In example1's row5 output: 2s at positions1 and4. In example2's row1 output: 1s at positions1,2,4,5.\n\nThis suggests that the output row is constructed by placing the non-zero elements symmetrically around the center. For a six-element row, the symmetry is around the midpoint between elements 2 and3.\n\nFor example, placing the non-zero elements such that positionsi and 5-i are mirrored.\n\nBut how to determine where to place them based on the input.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output rows are created by taking the non-zero elements from the input row and placing them in both halves of the output row, mirrored.\n\nFor example, if the input row has non-zero elements in certain positions, those are mirrored in both halves of the output row.\n\nFor example, in example0's row1 input: non-zero at positions1 and2. In the output row, they are placed in positions0,1 and3,4. So mirrored in each half.\n\nBut how is this determined.\n\nAlternatively, the output row is formed by taking the non-zero elements of the input row and placing them in the first half of the output row, then mirroring them in the second half.\n\nFor example:\n\nRow1 of example0's input: non-zero elements [8,8]. Place them in the first half (positions0,1) of a three-element array, then mirror to the second half. So first half: [8,8,0], second half: [8,8,0]. Combined \u2192 [8,8,0,8,8,0], which matches.\n\nRow2 of example0's input: non-zero at position2. Place in the first half as [0,8,0], mirror to the second half \u2192 [0,8,0,0,8,0]. Which matches.\n\nRow3 of example0's input: non-zero elements [8,8,8]. Place in first half (positions0,1,2) \u2192 [8,8,8], mirror to second half \u2192 [8,8,8,8,8,8]. Which matches.\n\nThis seems to fit. So the pattern is:\n\nFor each non-zero input row:\n\n1. Take the non-zero elements and their surrounding zeros to form a three-element window.\n\n   The window is determined by the positions of the non-zero elements. The window should include all non-zero elements and be centered around them if possible.\n\n2. Mirror this three-element window to form the second half of the output row.\n\nSo the output row is the three-element window followed by its mirror image.\n\nBut how to choose the three-element window.\n\nIn example0's row1: non-zero elements are at positions1 and2. The three-element window could be [0,8,8]. Mirror \u2192 [8,8,0]. Combined gives [0,8,8,8,8,0]. But the output is [8,8,0,8,8,0]. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, the three-element window is [8,8,0], mirror is [0,8,8]. Combined gives [8,8,0,0,8,8]. Not matching.\n\nBut example0's output row is [8,8,0,8,8,0]. Which is two copies of [8,8,0].\n\nAh, maybe the three-element window is chosen as the first three elements of the input row that contain non-zero elements. For example, row1 of example0's input: [0,8,8,0,...]. The first three elements are [0,8,8]. Mirror is [8,8,0]. Then combine as [0,8,8,8,8,0]. But output is [8,8,0,8,8,0]. So not matching.\n\nThis is really challenging. Let's try to find a different approach.\n\nLooking at the output rows in the examples:\n\nEach output row is exactly six elements long. The input rows are eight elements long. Perhaps each output row is formed by combining the first three and last three elements of the input row, reversed.\n\nFor example, example0's row1 input: [0,8,8,0,0,0,0,0]. First three: [0,8,8]. Last three: [0,0,0]. Reversed last three: [0,0,0]. Combined \u2192 [0,8,8,0,0,0]. Not matching output [8,8,0,8,8,0].\n\nNo.\n\nAlternatively, take the middle three elements of the input row. For example, in an eight-element row, the middle three would be positions2,3,4. But example0's row1: positions2,3,4 are 8,0,0. Reverse would be 0,0,8. Combined \u2192 [8,0,0,0,0,8]. Not matching.\n\nAlternatively, take the first three and last three elements of the input row, excluding the first and last elements. Not sure.\n\nAnother observation: the output rows in the examples have the same number of non-zero elements as the input rows, but duplicated.\n\nFor example0's row1 input: two 8s \u2192 output row has four 8s. But example0's output row0 has four 8s. \n\nExample1's row5 input: one 2 \u2192 output row has two 2s.\n\nExample1's row7 input: two 2s \u2192 output row has four 2s.\n\nExample2's row1 input: two 1s \u2192 output row has four 1s.\n\nExample2's row2 input: one 1 \u2192 output row has two 1s.\n\nSo the pattern is that each non-zero element in the input row is duplicated in the output row. But how?\n\nIn example0's row1, the output row has 8s at positions0,1,3,4. Which is two pairs of 8s. So each non-zero element is duplicated in two positions in the output row.\n\nFor a non-zero element at position x in the input row, where x ranges from 0 to 7 (since input rows are eight elements), it's mapped to positions y and y+3 in the output row (which has six elements). \n\nBut how to determine y.\n\nAlternatively, each input position is scaled down to fit into the output row's six elements. For example, input positions 0-7 are mapped to output positions 0-5. Maybe by some scaling factor.\n\nBut this is unclear.\n\nAlternatively, the output row is a compressed version of the input row, taking every other element. But this doesn't fit.\n\nAnother idea: the output rows have six elements, which is 3/4 of the input's eight columns. So perhaps each output element is the sum or combination of certain input columns.\n\nBut the examples show that non-zero elements are duplicated, not summed.\n\nAlternatively, the output rows are formed by taking columns 1-6 of the input row, but I'm not sure.\n\nThis is getting too time-consuming. Based on the previous hypothesis that worked for most examples except example2, I'll proceed with that pattern, but adjust for example2.\n\nIn example2's row1 input: non-zero elements [1,1]. According to the previous pattern, duplicate to [1,1,1,1], then add two zeros to make six elements. But the output is [0,1,1,0,1,1], which has four 1s and two zeros. This suggests that the zeros are inserted at positions0 and3. So the pattern for even-length non-zero elements is to insert a zero at the beginning and middle.\n\nSo for length2 non-zero elements:\n\nOriginal: [a, b]\n\nDuplicate: [a, b, a, b]\n\nInsert zeros at positions0 and3: [0, a, b, 0, a, b]. Which gives [0, a, b, 0, a, b], which matches example2's row1 output [0,1,1,0,1,1].\n\nBut example0's row1 output is [8,8,0,8,8,0], which would be [a, b, 0, a, b, 0]. So there's inconsistency.\n\nBut in example0's row1, the non-zero elements are at positions1 and2. Maybe the zeros are inserted at positions2 and5. But in example2's row1, the non-zero elements are at positions5 and6 (input row1: [0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0]), which are towards the end. So the pattern might depend on the position of the non-zero elements in the input row.\n\nAlternatively, the output row is formed by taking the non-zero elements, duplicating them, and placing them in the output row such that they are centered.\n\nFor example, in example0's row1, the non-zero elements are at positions1 and2. Centered in a six-element row would be positions1,2,3,4. But the output has 8s at 0,1,3,4. So not centered.\n\nThis suggests that the position in the input row affects where they are placed in the output.\n\nBut this seems too variable. Given the time constraints, I'll proceed with the initial pattern but adjust for example2.\n\nIn example2's row1, the non-zero elements are [1,1]. According to the pattern for length2, insert zeros at the beginning and middle. So [0,1,1,0,1,1], which matches the output. This suggests that for non-zero elements that are in the later positions of the input row, the zeros are added at the beginning and middle. Whereas for non-zero elements in the earlier positions of the input row, the zeros are added at the middle and end.\n\nBut how to determine this automatically.\n\nPerhaps the pattern is to take the non-zero elements, duplicate them, and then pad with zeros on both ends to reach six elements. For example:\n\nIf the non-zero elements are in the first half of the input row, pad zeros at the middle and end.\n\nIf they are in the second half, pad zeros at the beginning and middle.\n\nBut this requires knowing their position, which complicates the pattern.\n\nAlternatively, the padding is done based on the position of the non-zero elements in the input row.\n\nBut without clear rules from the training examples, it's hard to generalize.\n\nGiven that the initial pattern worked for example0 and example1 but not example2, but example2's output can be explained by a different padding pattern, perhaps the correct approach is to:\n\nFor each non-zero row in the input:\n\n1. Extract the non-zero elements.\n\n2. Duplicate them.\n\n3. Insert zeros at the beginning and middle to reach six elements if the non-zero elements are in the latter half of the input row.\n\nOr insert zeros at the middle and end if they are in the first half.\n\nBut determining the \"half\" is subjective.\n\nAlternatively, the padding is always done by adding zeros at the beginning and end of the duplicated elements.\n\nBut this doesn't fit example0.\n\nAlternatively, the pattern is that for each non-zero input row, the output row is formed by taking the non-zero elements, duplicating them, and then inserting zeros in the middle and at the end.\n\nBut this also varies.\n\nGiven the time, I'll proceed with the test input applying the initial pattern that worked for example0 and example1, even though example2 is an exception. Perhaps example2's non-zero elements are treated differently because they are in a different position.\n\nBut the test input's non-zero elements are in rows4,5,6. Let's process them according to the initial pattern:\n\nRow4: [3] \u2192 duplicate \u2192 [3,3] \u2192 insert zeros \u2192 [0,3,0,0,3,0].\n\nRow5: [3,3,3] \u2192 duplicate \u2192 six elements \u2192 [3,3,3,3,3,3].\n\nRow6: [3] \u2192 duplicate \u2192 [3,3] \u2192 insert zeros \u2192 [0,3,0,0,3,0].\n\nThus, the output would be:\n\n[0,3,0,0,3,0]\n\n[3,3,3,3,3,3]\n\n[0,3,0,0,3,0]\n\nBut in example2, row1's output is [0,1,1,0,1,1], which uses a different padding (zeros at the start and middle). If the test input's non-zero elements are in the middle and later rows, perhaps their padding is similar to example0 and example1.\n\nThus, the final answer for the test input should be the three rows as calculated above."
