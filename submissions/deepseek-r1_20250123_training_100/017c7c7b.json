        "cot_1": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. So, looking at the training examples, each input is a list of lists, and the output seems to be a modified version of the input with some elements changed and the structure possibly expanded.\n\nStarting with Example 0. The input has 6 rows, and the output has 9. Hmm. Let's look at the numbers. The input uses 0s and 1s, and the output uses 0s and 2s. So maybe all the 1s in the input are turned into 2s. Let me check. Yes, in Example 0, wherever there's a 1 in the input, it's a 2 in the output. That seems to hold for all examples. So first transformation is replacing 1s with 2s, leaving 0s as they are.\n\nBut then, the output rows are longer than the input. Wait, no. Looking at the number of rows: in Example 0, input has 6 rows, output has 9. So maybe each input row is being tripled in some way. Wait, 6 to 9: 6 * 1.5 =9. Hmm. Let me check the input and output structure.\n\nLooking at Example 0's input and output:\n\nInput rows:\n[0,1,0]\n[1,1,0]\n[0,1,0]\n[0,1,1]\n[0,1,0]\n[1,1,0]\n\nOutput rows:\n[0,2,0]\n[2,2,0]\n[0,2,0]\n[0,2,2]\n[0,2,0]\n[2,2,0]\n[0,2,0]\n[0,2,2]\n[0,2,0]\n\nWait, the output has 9 rows. Let's see how the input rows are transformed. Let me compare each input row to the output. Maybe each input row is followed by two other rows? Or perhaps each row is duplicated with some modification.\n\nWait, maybe each row in the input is being expanded into multiple rows. For example, in Example 0's input, the first row [0,1,0] becomes [0,2,0] in the output. Then the second row [1,1,0] becomes [2,2,0], followed by [0,2,0], which is the same as the first transformed row. Wait, no. Let me list the input and output rows side by side.\n\nInput:\nRow 0: [0,1,0]\nRow 1: [1,1,0]\nRow 2: [0,1,0]\nRow 3: [0,1,1]\nRow 4: [0,1,0]\nRow 5: [1,1,0]\n\nOutput:\n[0,2,0] (Row 0 transformed)\n[2,2,0] (Row 1 transformed)\n[0,2,0] (Row 2 transformed)\n[0,2,2] (Row 3 transformed)\n[0,2,0] (Row4 transformed)\n[2,2,0] (Row5 transformed)\n[0,2,0] (Again like row0?)\n[0,2,2] (Again like row3?)\n[0,2,0] (Again like row4?)\n\nWait, the output seems to have the transformed input rows followed by some repetition. Let's count the output rows. For Example0, the input has 6 rows, output has 9. So 6 + 3 = 9. The first 6 rows are the transformed input rows (with 1s to 2s), then adding 3 more rows. Let's see what those are. The 7th row is [0,2,0], which is the same as the transformed row0. The 8th is [0,2,2], same as transformed row3. The 9th is [0,2,0], same as transformed row4. So maybe the pattern is that after transforming each row (changing 1s to 2s), we append the first three transformed rows again? Or maybe the last three? Or it's a repetition of certain rows.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each input row is followed by a copy of itself, but not exactly. Wait, perhaps each original row in the input is generating three rows in the output. But 6 input rows would become 18, which isn't the case here. Hmm. Wait, in Example0, output has 9 rows. 6 input rows, 9 output rows: 6 * 1.5. So maybe every two input rows produce three output rows? Let's check.\n\nIn Example0, input rows are 6. Output rows are 9. So 6 rows become 9. So 3 sets of 2 input rows become 3 output rows each. For example, for each pair of input rows, generate three output rows. Let's see.\n\nTake first two input rows of Example0:\n\nRow0: [0,1,0] \u2192 [0,2,0]\nRow1: [1,1,0] \u2192 [2,2,0]\n\nIn the output, the first three rows are [0,2,0], [2,2,0], [0,2,0]. Wait, row0, row1, then row0 again? Because after row1 comes row2 in the input, which is [0,1,0] \u2192 [0,2,0]. Hmm, maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each input row is followed by another row. For example, for each input row, we add two more rows. But no, that would be 6 * 3 = 18 rows. So that's not matching.\n\nAlternatively, the output is the transformed input followed by a transformed version of certain parts. For Example0, the output is the transformed input (6 rows) followed by the first three transformed rows again (rows 0,1,2 \u2192 3 rows). So total 9. Let's check:\n\nTransformed input rows (6 rows):\n[0,2,0]\n[2,2,0]\n[0,2,0]\n[0,2,2]\n[0,2,0]\n[2,2,0]\n\nThen adding the first three rows again:\n[0,2,0]\n[2,2,0]\n[0,2,0]\n\nBut wait, the actual output is:\n\n[0,2,0]\n[2,2,0]\n[0,2,0]\n[0,2,2]\n[0,2,0]\n[2,2,0]\n[0,2,0]\n[0,2,2]\n[0,2,0]\n\nHmm, no. The added rows are [0,2,0], [0,2,2], [0,2,0], which are the transformed rows 0, 3, 4. Not sure. Alternatively, maybe the output is the transformed input followed by the transformed input's first half. Let's see. The transformed input has 6 rows. The output adds 3 rows. The 6 transformed rows are rows 0-5. Then rows 6-8 are [0,2,0], [0,2,2], [0,2,0], which correspond to transformed rows 0,3,4. So maybe selecting certain rows.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is created by inserting certain rows after each original row. For instance, after each original transformed row, insert another row. Let's see. For example0:\n\nOriginal transformed rows are 6. Output has 9. So inserting 3 rows. How?\n\nLooking at the output sequence:\n\nRow0: transformed row0\nRow1: transformed row1\nRow2: transformed row2\nRow3: transformed row3\nRow4: transformed row4\nRow5: transformed row5\nRow6: transformed row0\nRow7: transformed row3\nRow8: transformed row4\n\nHmm, perhaps after the entire transformed input, append transformed row0, row3, row4. But why those rows?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the transformed input rows followed by the transformed input rows again, but only the first three. But in Example0, after 6 rows, adding 3 more. That doesn't fit. Let's check the other examples.\n\nLooking at Example1's input and output. Input has 6 rows. Output has 9 rows. So same as before. Let's check:\n\nInput rows:\n\n0: [0,1,0] \u2192 [0,2,0]\n1: [1,0,1] \u2192 [2,0,2]\n2: [0,1,0] \u2192 [0,2,0]\n3: [1,0,1] \u2192 [2,0,2]\n4: [0,1,0] \u2192 [0,2,0]\n5: [1,0,1] \u2192 [2,0,2]\n\nOutput rows:\n\n[0,2,0]\n[2,0,2]\n[0,2,0]\n[2,0,2]\n[0,2,0]\n[2,0,2]\n[0,2,0]\n[2,0,2]\n[0,2,0]\n\nWait, the output is the transformed input followed by adding three more rows. But here, the output after the transformed input is [0,2,0], [2,0,2], [0,2,0]. Which are transformed rows 0,1,2. So perhaps the pattern is to append the first three transformed rows again. Let's check.\n\nIn Example1, transformed input is 6 rows. Then appended with first three transformed rows: 0,1,2. So total 6 +3=9. Yes. Let's see:\n\nOriginal transformed input is rows 0-5: [0,2,0], [2,0,2], [0,2,0], [2,0,2], [0,2,0], [2,0,2]. Then append [0,2,0], [2,0,2], [0,2,0], which are the first three rows. So output becomes 9 rows.\n\nSimilarly, in Example0's output, after the first 6 transformed rows, they add the first three transformed rows again. Let's check. Original transformed rows 0-5:\n\nRow0: [0,2,0]\n\nRow1: [2,2,0]\n\nRow2: [0,2,0]\n\nRow3: [0,2,2]\n\nRow4: [0,2,0]\n\nRow5: [2,2,0]\n\nThen appending rows 0,3,4? Wait no, the next rows in Example0's output after row5 are [0,2,0], [0,2,2], [0,2,0]. Which correspond to transformed row0, row3, row4. Hmm, that doesn't match the first three. So maybe the pattern is different here.\n\nWait, maybe the pattern is that after transforming each row, you insert two copies of certain rows. Alternatively, maybe each row is followed by a copy of itself. But that would double the number of rows, which isn't the case here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is generated by repeating the input sequence and then truncating. For example, take the transformed input, repeat it 1.5 times. For 6 rows, 6 *1.5=9. So in Example0, the transformed input is 6 rows. Repeating the entire transformed input once would give 12, but we need 9. So maybe the first 9 rows of the transformed input repeated once. But in Example0, the output is 9 rows, which is the transformed input plus the first three transformed rows again. So 6+3=9.\n\nBut in Example0, the first 6 transformed rows are:\n\n0: [0,2,0]\n\n1: [2,2,0]\n\n2: [0,2,0]\n\n3: [0,2,2]\n\n4: [0,2,0]\n\n5: [2,2,0]\n\nThen the next three rows are:\n\n6: [0,2,0] (same as row0)\n\n7: [0,2,2] (same as row3)\n\n8: [0,2,0] (same as row4)\n\nSo in this case, after the initial 6 rows, they add row0, row3, row4. So that's not the first three. So maybe the pattern varies between examples. Hmm.\n\nLooking at Example2:\n\nInput has 6 rows:\n\n[0,1,0]\n\n[1,1,0]\n\n[0,1,0]\n\n[0,1,0]\n\n[1,1,0]\n\n[0,1,0]\n\nTransformed output (changing 1s to 2s) would have:\n\n[0,2,0]\n\n[2,2,0]\n\n[0,2,0]\n\n[0,2,0]\n\n[2,2,0]\n\n[0,2,0]\n\nThen output has 9 rows. The output is:\n\n[0,2,0]\n\n[2,2,0]\n\n[0,2,0]\n\n[0,2,0]\n\n[2,2,0]\n\n[0,2,0]\n\n[0,2,0]\n\n[2,2,0]\n\n[0,2,0]\n\nSo after the first 6 rows, they added [0,2,0], [2,2,0], [0,2,0]. Which are the first three transformed rows again. So in Example2, after transformed input rows 0-5, append rows 0,1,2. So the pattern here is appending the first three transformed rows again.\n\nBut in Example0, after 6 transformed rows, they added rows 0,3,4. That doesn't fit. Wait, let me check again. Example0's output:\n\nOriginal transformed rows (6 rows):\n\n0: [0,2,0]\n\n1: [2,2,0]\n\n2: [0,2,0]\n\n3: [0,2,2]\n\n4: [0,2,0]\n\n5: [2,2,0]\n\nThen added rows:\n\n6: [0,2,0] (same as row0)\n\n7: [0,2,2] (same as row3)\n\n8: [0,2,0] (same as row4)\n\nSo here, the added rows are 0,3,4.\n\nBut in Example1, the added rows after 6 transformed rows are 0,1,2. So the pattern varies. Hmm. That complicates things. Maybe the pattern isn't consistent between examples. Alternatively, perhaps there's another way to look at it.\n\nWait, perhaps the output is the transformed input followed by a mirrored or reversed version of part of it. Not sure. Alternatively, maybe the output is the transformed input, and then inserting copies of certain rows in between.\n\nAlternatively, the number of output rows is 1.5 times the input rows, which would fit for 6 input rows (6 *1.5=9). So each input row is converted into 1.5 output rows, but that's not possible directly. So maybe every two input rows generate three output rows.\n\nFor example, two input rows become three output rows by adding a copy of the first row after the second. Let's test this.\n\nTake Example1's input rows:\n\nRow0: [0,1,0] \u2192 [0,2,0]\n\nRow1: [1,0,1] \u2192 [2,0,2]\n\nRow2: [0,1,0] \u2192 [0,2,0]\n\nRow3: [1,0,1] \u2192 [2,0,2]\n\nRow4: [0,1,0] \u2192 [0,2,0]\n\nRow5: [1,0,1] \u2192 [2,0,2]\n\nGrouped into pairs:\n\nPair0: rows0,1 \u2192 output rows0,1,2 (0,1,0)\n\nWait, no. The output of Example1 is:\n\n[0,2,0]\n\n[2,0,2]\n\n[0,2,0]\n\n[2,0,2]\n\n[0,2,0]\n\n[2,0,2]\n\n[0,2,0]\n\n[2,0,2]\n\n[0,2,0]\n\nEach pair of input rows (e.g., 0 and1) becomes three rows in the output: the transformed rows followed by the transformed row0 again. But in Example1's output, after each pair, maybe they insert a copy of the first row of the pair. Let's see:\n\nPair0: row0 \u2192 [0,2,0], row1 \u2192 [2,0,2]. Then insert row0 again? So three rows: [0,2,0], [2,0,2], [0,2,0]. That matches the first three output rows. Then next pair: row2 \u2192 [0,2,0], row3 \u2192 [2,0,2]. Insert row2 again? So again three rows. But the output for Example1's next three would be [0,2,0], [2,0,2], [0,2,0], which continues. But then the total would be 6 pairs (but input has 6 rows, so three pairs). Each pair becomes three rows. 3 pairs *3=9 rows. Yes, that fits.\n\nSo for each pair of input rows (two rows), we generate three output rows: the transformed first row, the transformed second row, and a copy of the transformed first row again. So for two input rows, we have three output rows.\n\nSo in Example1:\n\nPair0: rows0 and1 \u2192 output rows0,1,0 (transformed) \u2192 [0,2,0], [2,0,2], [0,2,0]\n\nPair1: rows2 and3 \u2192 transformed rows2 and3, then row2 again \u2192 [0,2,0], [2,0,2], [0,2,0]\n\nPair2: rows4 and5 \u2192 transformed rows4 and5, then row4 again \u2192 [0,2,0], [2,0,2], [0,2,0]\n\nSo the output is:\n\nRow0: [0,2,0]\n\nRow1: [2,0,2]\n\nRow2: [0,2,0]\n\nRow3: [0,2,0]\n\nRow4: [2,0,2]\n\nRow5: [0,2,0]\n\nRow6: [0,2,0]\n\nRow7: [2,0,2]\n\nRow8: [0,2,0]\n\nWait, but in Example1's actual output, it's:\n\n[0,2,0]\n[2,0,2]\n[0,2,0]\n[2,0,2]\n[0,2,0]\n[2,0,2]\n[0,2,0]\n[2,0,2]\n[0,2,0]\n\nHmm, that's different. Oh, because when you process each pair of input rows (rows0-1, rows2-3, rows4-5), each pair becomes three output rows. So for Example1:\n\nAfter processing pair0 (rows0 and1), we get [0,2,0], [2,0,2], [0,2,0]. Then pair1 (rows2 and3) are [0,2,0], [2,0,2], so the three output rows would be [0,2,0], [2,0,2], [0,2,0]. Similarly for pair2.\n\nSo the output is:\n\nPair0:\n\n0: [0,2,0]\n\n1: [2,0,2]\n\n2: [0,2,0]\n\nPair1:\n\n3: [0,2,0]\n\n4: [2,0,2]\n\n5: [0,2,0]\n\nPair2:\n\n6: [0,2,0]\n\n7: [2,0,2]\n\n8: [0,2,0]\n\nBut in the actual output of Example1, it's:\n\nRows 0-8:\n\n[0,2,0]\n\n[2,0,2]\n\n[0,2,0]\n\n[2,0,2]\n\n[0,2,0]\n\n[2,0,2]\n\n[0,2,0]\n\n[2,0,2]\n\n[0,2,0]\n\nWhich is exactly the output. So that pattern holds. So the rule is: for every two consecutive rows in the input, generate three output rows. The first two are the transformed versions of the two rows (changing 1s to 2s), and the third is a copy of the transformed first row of the pair.\n\nWait, but in Example0, the input is 6 rows. So three pairs:\n\nPair0: rows0 and1 \u2192 transformed rows0 and1, then row0 again.\n\nPair1: rows2 and3 \u2192 transformed rows2 and3, then row2 again.\n\nPair2: rows4 and5 \u2192 transformed rows4 and5, then row4 again.\n\nSo output for Example0 would be:\n\nPair0:\n\n0: [0,2,0]\n\n1: [2,2,0]\n\n2: [0,2,0]\n\nPair1:\n\n3: [0,2,0]\n\n4: [0,2,2]\n\n5: [0,2,0]\n\nPair2:\n\n6: [0,2,0]\n\n7: [2,2,0]\n\n8: [0,2,0]\n\nWhich matches the output of Example0:\n\n[0,2,0]\n[2,2,0]\n[0,2,0] (pair0)\n[0,2,2] (pair1's first row? Wait, no. Pair1 is rows2 and3. Transformed row2 is [0,2,0], row3 is [0,2,2]. So the three rows would be [0,2,0], [0,2,2], [0,2,0]. Which is what's present in the output as rows3,4,5: [0,2,2], [0,2,0], [2,2,0]. Wait, no. Let's check the actual output for Example0.\n\nActual output for Example0:\n\n0: [0,2,0]\n\n1: [2,2,0]\n\n2: [0,2,0]\n\n3: [0,2,2]\n\n4: [0,2,0]\n\n5: [2,2,0]\n\n6: [0,2,0]\n\n7: [0,2,2]\n\n8: [0,2,0]\n\nHmm, according to the pair approach, pair0 (rows0 and1) should generate rows0-2: [0,2,0], [2,2,0], [0,2,0]. Then pair1 (rows2 and3) should generate rows3-5: [0,2,0], [0,2,2], [0,2,0]. Pair2 (rows4 and5) would generate rows6-8: [0,2,0], [2,2,0], [0,2,0].\n\nBut the actual output of Example0 is:\n\nRows0-2: correct.\n\nRow3: [0,2,2]\n\nRow4: [0,2,0]\n\nRow5: [2,2,0]\n\nRow6: [0,2,0]\n\nRow7: [0,2,2]\n\nRow8: [0,2,0]\n\nSo according to this, pair1's generated rows are [0,2,0], [0,2,2], [0,2,0], which would be rows3,4,5. But the actual rows3 is [0,2,2], row4 is [0,2,0], which are the transformed row3 and row4. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused here. Let me list all pairs again.\n\nExample0's input is:\n\nRow0: [0,1,0] \u2192 [0,2,0]\n\nRow1: [1,1,0] \u2192 [2,2,0]\n\nRow2: [0,1,0] \u2192 [0,2,0]\n\nRow3: [0,1,1] \u2192 [0,2,2]\n\nRow4: [0,1,0] \u2192 [0,2,0]\n\nRow5: [1,1,0] \u2192 [2,2,0]\n\nPairs:\n\nPair0: row0 and row1 \u2192 transformed to [0,2,0], [2,2,0], then add [0,2,0] \u2192 rows0-2.\n\nPair1: row2 and row3 \u2192 transformed to [0,2,0], [0,2,2], then add [0,2,0] \u2192 rows3-5.\n\nPair2: row4 and row5 \u2192 transformed to [0,2,0], [2,2,0], then add [0,2,0] \u2192 rows6-8.\n\nSo the output should be:\n\nRows0: [0,2,0]\n\nRow1: [2,2,0]\n\nRow2: [0,2,0]\n\nRow3: [0,2,0]\n\nRow4: [0,2,2]\n\nRow5: [0,2,0]\n\nRow6: [0,2,0]\n\nRow7: [2,2,0]\n\nRow8: [0,2,0]\n\nBut the actual output for Example0 is:\n\n[0,2,0]\n\n[2,2,0]\n\n[0,2,0]\n\n[0,2,2]\n\n[0,2,0]\n\n[2,2,0]\n\n[0,2,0]\n\n[0,2,2]\n\n[0,2,0]\n\nHmm, this doesn't match the expected pattern. So perhaps the pair approach isn't correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by inserting a copy of the first row of the input after every two rows. Let me check.\n\nIn Example0's output:\n\nAfter transformed rows0-5, there's [0,2,0], [0,2,2], [0,2,0]. These are transformed rows0,3,4. Not sure why.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the transformed input followed by transformed input rows 0,3,4. But why those?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is created by taking the transformed input and inserting between each pair of rows a copy of the first row. For example:\n\nOriginal transformed rows: A, B, C, D, E, F.\n\nInsert after B: A \u2192 A, B, A, C, D, E, F, A, D, E.\n\nNo, not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each row in the input is followed by a duplicate, but not sure.\n\nAnother angle: look at the test input.\n\nTest input:\n\n[1,1,1]\n\n[0,1,0]\n\n[0,1,0]\n\n[1,1,1]\n\n[0,1,0]\n\n[0,1,0]\n\nSo six rows. According to the previous examples, the output should have 9 rows. So apply the pattern of replacing 1s with 2s, then append three more rows.\n\nAssuming that the pattern is to append the first three transformed rows again.\n\nBut let's check the test input.\n\nTransforming the test input by replacing 1s with 2s:\n\nRow0: [2,2,2]\n\nRow1: [0,2,0]\n\nRow2: [0,2,0]\n\nRow3: [2,2,2]\n\nRow4: [0,2,0]\n\nRow5: [0,2,0]\n\nSo the transformed input is six rows. Then append the first three transformed rows:\n\nRow0: [2,2,2]\n\nRow1: [0,2,0]\n\nRow2: [0,2,0]\n\nSo the output would be:\n\n[2,2,2]\n\n[0,2,0]\n\n[0,2,0]\n\n[2,2,2]\n\n[0,2,0]\n\n[0,2,0]\n\n[2,2,2]\n\n[0,2,0]\n\n[0,2,0]\n\nBut let's see if this matches the examples.\n\nIn Example0, the output after transformed input is [0,2,0], [0,2,2], [0,2,0], which are rows0,3,4. But in the test case, if we append the first three transformed rows, that's rows0,1,2. Which is similar to Example1 and Example2's pattern.\n\nBut in Example0, the appended rows were not the first three. So maybe there's inconsistency. Alternatively, perhaps the pattern is to append the transformed rows 0,3,4. But how to determine that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the pattern is to append the first row of each pair of transformed rows. For example, after processing pairs, the appended rows are the first row of each pair.\n\nBut this is getting complicated. Let me think differently.\n\nLooking at all examples, the output has 1.5 times the number of input rows. So for 6 input rows, 9 output rows.\n\nThe transformation is:\n\n- Replace all 1s with 2s.\n\n- Then, append the first three transformed rows again. But in Example0, the appended rows were not the first three. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is the transformed input followed by the transformed input again, but truncated to 9 rows. For example, 6 transformed rows followed by 3 transformed rows again. For 6+3=9. So for the test case, the output would be the six transformed rows plus the first three of them again.\n\nBut in Example0, the six transformed rows are:\n\n0: [0,2,0]\n\n1: [2,2,0]\n\n2: [0,2,0]\n\n3: [0,2,2]\n\n4: [0,2,0]\n\n5: [2,2,0]\n\nAppending the first three would give:\n\n6: [0,2,0]\n\n7: [2,2,0]\n\n8: [0,2,0]\n\nBut the actual output of Example0 after the six rows is:\n\n6: [0,2,0]\n\n7: [0,2,2]\n\n8: [0,2,0]\n\nWhich are rows0,3,4. So this pattern doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. Maybe the appended rows are the first row, then the fourth, then the fifth. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the appended rows are the ones that have 2s in the third position. Like in Example0, row3 has [0,2,2], which is the only row with a 2 in the third element, and it's appended as row7. But that's not consistent.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is generated by taking each transformed row and then inserting a copy of the first row after it. For example:\n\nRow0: [0,2,0], insert row0 \u2192 [0,2,0], [0,2,0]\n\nBut this would double the rows. Which doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps after transforming, we duplicate every third row. Not sure.\n\nThis is getting tricky. Let me try to find another approach. Perhaps the output is the transformed input with every other row duplicated. For example, duplicate each row once. But that would lead to 12 rows for 6 input rows. Which is not the case. But maybe only duplicate certain rows.\n\nAlternatively, look at the output rows in Example0:\n\nThe first six are transformed input. Then rows6-8 are [0,2,0], [0,2,2], [0,2,0]. Which are rows0,3,4 of the transformed input.\n\nIn Example1's output, the appended rows are the first three transformed rows.\n\nIn Example2's output, the appended rows are the first three transformed rows.\n\nSo perhaps the pattern varies between examples, but that's unlikely. Maybe I made a mistake in Example0.\n\nWait, let's re-examine Example0's output:\n\nThe transformed input is 6 rows:\n\n0: [0,2,0]\n\n1: [2,2,0]\n\n2: [0,2,0]\n\n3: [0,2,2]\n\n4: [0,2,0]\n\n5: [2,2,0]\n\nThen the output adds three rows:\n\n6: [0,2,0] (row0)\n\n7: [0,2,2] (row3)\n\n8: [0,2,0] (row4)\n\nSo the appended rows are row0, row3, row4. Why those?\n\nLooking at the input rows, perhaps they're the rows that have 1s in the middle. For example, row0 of the input is [0,1,0], row3 is [0,1,1], row4 is [0,1,0]. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the appended rows are those that have a 1 in the input and transformed to 2, but only certain ones. Not sure.\n\nAnother approach: the output for each example is the transformed input followed by three more rows. The three more rows are the transformed rows that are in positions where the input row had a 1 in the third element. For example, in Example0's input, row3 is [0,1,1], which becomes [0,2,2]. So maybe this is one of the appended rows. But how to choose the others.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the three appended rows are the first row, the fourth row, and the fifth row of the transformed input. For Example0, row0, row3, row4. But why those?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the appended rows are the ones where the original input row had a 1 in the first position. Let's see:\n\nIn Example0's input:\n\nRow0: first element is 0 \u2192 no.\n\nRow1: first element 1 \u2192 yes. Transformed to 2.\n\nRow3: first element 0 \u2192 no.\n\nRow5: first element 1 \u2192 yes.\n\nSo maybe the appended rows are row1 and row5. But not sure.\n\nThis is getting too time-consuming. Let's try to think of the pattern that is consistent across all examples. \n\nIn all examples, the output is the transformed input (with 1s \u2192 2s) followed by three more rows. The question is, how are those three rows determined.\n\nIn Example1, the appended three rows are the first three transformed rows. In Example2, they are the first three. But in Example0, they're not. So perhaps the pattern is to append the first three transformed rows if the input has a certain structure. But that's not a consistent rule.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is created by taking each transformed row and then adding a copy of the first row after every two rows. For example:\n\nFor Example1:\n\nTransformed rows are:\n\n0: [0,2,0]\n\n1: [2,0,2]\n\n2: [0,2,0]\n\n3: [2,0,2]\n\n4: [0,2,0]\n\n5: [2,0,2]\n\nThen insert row0 after every two rows.\n\nSo after rows0 and1, insert row0.\n\nAfter rows2 and3, insert row0.\n\nAfter rows4 and5, insert row0.\n\nSo the output would be:\n\n[0,2,0], [2,0,2], [0,2,0], [0,2,0], [2,0,2], [0,2,0], [0,2,0], [2,0,2], [0,2,0]. Which matches Example1's output.\n\nYes, that seems to fit. Let's check Example1's output again. Yes, after every two rows, insert the first transformed row.\n\nSimilarly, in Example0:\n\nTransformed rows are 0-5 as before.\n\nInsert row0 after every two rows.\n\nSo the output would be:\n\nRow0: [0,2,0]\n\nRow1: [2,2,0]\n\nRow2: [0,2,0] (inserted row0)\n\nRow3: [0,2,0]\n\nRow4: [0,2,2]\n\nRow5: [0,2,0] (inserted row0)\n\nRow6: [0,2,0]\n\nRow7: [2,2,0]\n\nRow8: [0,2,0] (inserted row0)\n\nBut the actual output of Example0 is:\n\nRows0-2: [0,2,0], [2,2,0], [0,2,0]\n\nRows3-5: [0,2,2], [0,2,0], [2,2,0]\n\nRows6-8: [0,2,0], [0,2,2], [0,2,0]\n\nHmm, this doesn't fit. So the pattern would be different.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps after every two rows, insert the first row. Let's see for Example0:\n\nTransformed rows:\n\n0: [0,2,0]\n\n1: [2,2,0]\n\nInsert row0 after them \u2192 rows0,1,0.\n\nThen next two rows:\n\n2: [0,2,0]\n\n3: [0,2,2]\n\nInsert row0 \u2192 rows2,3,0.\n\nThen next two rows:\n\n4: [0,2,0]\n\n5: [2,2,0]\n\nInsert row0 \u2192 rows4,5,0.\n\nSo the output would be:\n\n[0,2,0], [2,2,0], [0,2,0], [0,2,0], [0,2,2], [0,2,0], [0,2,0], [2,2,0], [0,2,0]\n\nWhich does not match the actual output of Example0. So this approach doesn't work.\n\nAnother idea: in all the examples, the output is formed by taking the transformed input and then appending the transformed input's rows 0,3,4. For Example0:\n\nTransformed rows 0,3,4 \u2192 [0,2,0], [0,2,2], [0,2,0], which are the appended rows.\n\nBut why those rows?\n\nAlternatively, the appended rows are the transformed input's rows 0, 3, 4. But how to determine this pattern.\n\nIn Example1, the transformed input has 6 rows. Appended rows are 0,1,2. Which doesn't fit 0,3,4. So no.\n\nThis is getting too complicated. Let me think again.\n\nLet me look at the test input and try to apply possible patterns.\n\nTest input:\n\n[1,1,1]\n\n[0,1,0]\n\n[0,1,0]\n\n[1,1,1]\n\n[0,1,0]\n\n[0,1,0]\n\nTransformed to:\n\nRow0: [2,2,2]\n\nRow1: [0,2,0]\n\nRow2: [0,2,0]\n\nRow3: [2,2,2]\n\nRow4: [0,2,0]\n\nRow5: [0,2,0]\n\nIf the pattern is to append the first three transformed rows, then the output would be the six rows plus the first three, making nine:\n\nRow6: [2,2,2]\n\nRow7: [0,2,0]\n\nRow8: [0,2,0]\n\nSo the full output would be:\n\n[2,2,2]\n\n[0,2,0]\n\n[0,2,0]\n\n[2,2,2]\n\n[0,2,0]\n\n[0,2,0]\n\n[2,2,2]\n\n[0,2,0]\n\n[0,2,0]\n\nWhich would match the pattern seen in Example1 and Example2.\n\nBut in Example0, the appended rows are not the first three. So this would conflict. But maybe Example0 is a special case. But since the test input's structure is more similar to Example1 and Example2 (alternating rows), perhaps the pattern for the test case is to append the first three transformed rows.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking the transformed input and then adding a copy of the first row after each pair of rows.\n\nFor the test input:\n\nTransformed rows0-5:\n\n0: [2,2,2]\n\n1: [0,2,0]\n\n2: [0,2,0]\n\n3: [2,2,2]\n\n4: [0,2,0]\n\n5: [0,2,0]\n\nGroup into pairs:\n\nPair0: rows0 and1 \u2192 transformed rows0 and1, then insert row0.\n\nSo rows0,1,0.\n\nPair1: rows2 and3 \u2192 rows2,3,0.\n\nPair2: rows4 and5 \u2192 rows4,5,0.\n\nSo the output would be:\n\n[2,2,2]\n\n[0,2,0]\n\n[2,2,2]\n\n[0,2,0]\n\n[2,2,2]\n\n[0,2,0]\n\n[0,2,0]\n\n[2,2,2]\n\n[0,2,0]\n\nBut this doesn't seem to fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is to take each transformed row and add a copy of the first row after every three rows.\n\nBut I'm not making progress. Let's think differently.\n\nLooking back at all examples, the output for each is the transformed input (replace 1\u21922) followed by three more rows. The three more rows are:\n\nExample0: [0,2,0], [0,2,2], [0,2,0] \u2192 which are rows0,3,4 of transformed input.\n\nExample1: [0,2,0], [2,0,2], [0,2,0] \u2192 rows0,1,2.\n\nExample2: [0,2,0], [0,2,0], [2,2,0] \u2192 rows0,3,4.\n\nWait, no. Example2's output is:\n\n[0,2,0]\n\n[2,2,0]\n\n[0,2,0]\n\n[0,2,0]\n\n[2,2,0]\n\n[0,2,0]\n\n[0,2,0]\n\n[2,2,0]\n\n[0,2,0]\n\nSo the appended rows are [0,2,0], [2,2,0], [0,2,0], which are rows0,1,2 of the transformed input.\n\nAh, so perhaps in Example0, the appended rows are rows0,3,4, but that's not consistent. I'm stuck.\n\nMaybe the answer is to replace all 1s with 2s and then repeat the transformed input's rows 0, 3, and 4 at the end. But how to verify.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is the transformed input followed by the first row, then the fourth row, then the fifth row of the transformed input.\n\nBut without a clear pattern, it's hard to proceed.\n\nAnother approach: the output rows are the transformed input followed by the transformed input rows 0,3,4. Let's test.\n\nFor the test input:\n\nTransformed rows0-5:\n\n0: [2,2,2]\n\n1: [0,2,0]\n\n2: [0,2,0]\n\n3: [2,2,2]\n\n4: [0,2,0]\n\n5: [0,2,0]\n\nAppending rows0,3,4:\n\n6: [2,2,2]\n\n7: [2,2,2]\n\n8: [0,2,0]\n\nSo the full output would be:\n\n[2,2,2]\n\n[0,2,0]\n\n[0,2,0]\n\n[2,2,2]\n\n[0,2,0]\n\n[0,2,0]\n\n[2,2,2]\n\n[2,2,2]\n\n[0,2,0]\n\nBut I'm not sure if that matches the examples.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is created by taking the transformed input and then appending the transformed input's first row, then the third row, then the fourth row. But this is just guessing.\n\nGiven time constraints, perhaps the correct pattern is to replace all 1s with 2s and then append the first three transformed rows. This works for Example1 and Example2. But Example0 is an exception. Maybe the correct pattern is this, and Example0 has a different pattern due to a mistake. But in the competition setting, perhaps the intended pattern is to append the first three transformed rows.\n\nApplying that to the test case:\n\nTest input transformed:\n\nRow0: [2,2,2]\n\nRow1: [0,2,0]\n\nRow2: [0,2,0]\n\nRow3: [2,2,2]\n\nRow4: [0,2,0]\n\nRow5: [0,2,0]\n\nAppending the first three rows:\n\nRow6: [2,2,2]\n\nRow7: [0,2,0]\n\nRow8: [0,2,0]\n\nSo the output would be:\n\n[2,2,2]\n\n[0,2,0]\n\n[0,2,0]\n\n[2,2,2]\n\n[0,2,0]\n\n[0,2,0]\n\n[2,2,2]\n\n[0,2,0]\n\n[0,2,0]\n\nBut looking at Example0, this pattern doesn't fit. So maybe this isn't the correct answer. But given the examples, especially Example1 and Example2, this seems plausible.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is to duplicate the transformed input, but take the first 9 rows. For example, transformed input has 6 rows. Duplicate them, but only take the first 9. So rows0-5 followed by rows0-2.\n\nWhich would be the case for the test input.\n\nYes, this would fit the examples.\n\nExample1's output is the transformed input followed by the first three transformed rows again. Which is 6 +3=9.\n\nExample2's output is the transformed input followed by the first three transformed rows.\n\nExample0's output is not following this, but perhaps there's a mistake in my analysis.\n\nBut given that the test input's transformed rows are 6, appending the first three would give nine rows. So that's a possible answer.\n\nSo for the test input, the output would be:\n\nTransformed rows0-5:\n\n[2,2,2]\n\n[0,2,0]\n\n[0,2,0]\n\n[2,2,2]\n\n[0,2,0]\n\n[0,2,0]\n\nThen append the first three transformed rows:\n\n[2,2,2]\n\n[0,2,0]\n\n[0,2,0]\n\nSo the final output is the transformed input followed by the first three transformed rows.\n\nThus, the answer should be:\n\n[2,2,2]\n\n[0,2,0]\n\n[0,2,0]\n\n[2,2,2]\n\n[0,2,0]\n\n[0,2,0]\n\n[2,2,2]\n\n[0,2,0]\n\n[0,2,0]\n\nBut looking at the training examples, especially Example0, this doesn't fit. So maybe the correct pattern is different.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is created by inserting a copy of the first row after every two rows. Let's test this.\n\nFor the test input:\n\nTransformed rows are:\n\n0: [2,2,2]\n\n1: [0,2,0]\n\n2: [0,2,0]\n\n3: [2,2,2]\n\n4: [0,2,0]\n\n5: [0,2,0]\n\nInsert row0 after every two rows:\n\nAfter rows0 and1: insert row0 \u2192 rows0,1,0.\n\nThen after rows2 and3: insert row0 \u2192 rows2,3,0.\n\nThen after rows4 and5: insert row0 \u2192 rows4,5,0.\n\nResulting in:\n\nRow0: [2,2,2]\n\nRow1: [0,2,0]\n\nRow2: [2,2,2]\n\nRow3: [0,2,0]\n\nRow4: [2,2,2]\n\nRow5: [0,2,0]\n\nRow6: [0,2,0]\n\nRow7: [2,2,2]\n\nRow8: [0,2,0]\n\nBut this doesn't match the examples. \n\nAnother idea: perhaps the output is formed by taking each row and inserting a copy of the first transformed row after it. So each row is followed by the first row. But that would double the number of rows.\n\nAlternatively, after each row, insert the first row. For 6 rows, 12 rows. But in examples, it's 9 rows. So perhaps insert after every other row.\n\nThis is taking too long, but I need to make a decision. Based on the examples, especially Example1 and Example2, the pattern seems to be appending the first three transformed rows. So for the test case, that would be the answer.",

        "cot_2": "Okay, let's tackle this problem. So, I need to figure out the pattern that transforms the input lists into the output lists in the training examples, and then apply that to the test input. Let me start by looking at the examples carefully.\n\nLooking at Example 0:\n\nInput has six rows:\n[0,1,0]\n[1,1,0]\n[0,1,0]\n[0,1,1]\n[0,1,0]\n[1,1,0]\n\nOutput has nine rows. Each row in the output seems to have 0s and 2s. Let me check how the input rows are transformed. \n\nFirst, notice that in the output, all the 1s in the input are replaced by 2s. For example, the second row [1,1,0] becomes [2,2,0]. That seems straightforward. But why are there more rows in the output than the input? The input has 6 rows, output has 9. So maybe each input row is being duplicated in some way, with an extra row added in between?\n\nWait, let's look at the structure. Let's count the output rows for Example 0:\n\nOriginal input rows (6 rows):\n\nRow 0: [0,1,0] \u2192 becomes [0,2,0] (row 0 in output)\nRow 1: [1,1,0] \u2192 becomes [2,2,0] (row 1)\nRow 2: [0,1,0] \u2192 [0,2,0] (row 2)\nRow 3: [0,1,1] \u2192 [0,2,2] (row 3)\nRow 4: [0,1,0] \u2192 [0,2,0] (row 4)\nRow 5: [1,1,0] \u2192 [2,2,0] (row 5)\n\nBut the output has 9 rows. Wait, maybe after each original row, an additional row is inserted? Let's check:\n\nLooking at the output for Example 0:\n\n[0,2,0] (row0)\n[2,2,0] (row1)\n[0,2,0] (row2)\n[0,2,2] (row3)\n[0,2,0] (row4)\n[2,2,0] (row5)\n[0,2,0] (row6)\n[0,2,2] (row7)\n[0,2,0] (row8)\n\nHmm, how does the input map here? The original input is 6 rows. The output is 9 rows, which is 6 + 3. Wait, maybe each input row is followed by a copy of the next row? Or perhaps every even-indexed row (0,2,4) in the output is the transformed input row, and odd rows are duplicates?\n\nAlternatively, maybe after each transformed row, another row is inserted that is a copy of the next row. Let me check the first example's output. Wait, the output rows after the first three:\n\nOriginal input rows 0-5 become output rows 0-5, but then there's an additional 3 rows. Wait, maybe the input is repeated with some pattern. Let's see:\n\nIn Example 0's input, the first three rows are [0,1,0], [1,1,0], [0,1,0]. Then the next three are [0,1,1], [0,1,0], [1,1,0]. The output adds three more rows. Wait, maybe the output is the input transformed (with 1\u21922), and then each of the original transformed rows is followed by some pattern. Alternatively, perhaps the output is the transformed input followed by a copy of the transformed input's first few rows again. Let me check.\n\nOriginal output rows 0-5 are transformed input. Then rows 6-8 are [0,2,0], [0,2,2], [0,2,0]. Which looks like the transformed version of the first three input rows (but not exactly). Wait, input row 3 is [0,1,1], which becomes [0,2,2]. Then output row 7 is [0,2,2], row 8 is [0,2,0], which is transformed input row4. Hmm, this isn't obvious.\n\nWait, maybe the output is constructed by inserting a new row after each original row. For example, each input row is transformed, then an additional row is inserted which is a copy of the next row. Let's see:\n\nIn Example 0, input has 6 rows. If after each transformed row, we insert a copy of the same row again, but that would double the rows to 12, which isn't the case. So that's not it.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the transformed input rows, but each followed by a modified version. Let's see. For instance, the first input row [0,1,0] becomes [0,2,0]. Then perhaps insert a row that's similar. But in Example 0, after the first row [0,2,0] comes [2,2,0], which is the next input row. So the output seems to just be the transformed input rows in order. But the output has more rows than the input. Wait, maybe the input is transformed and then repeated? Let's check the count.\n\nExample0 input: 6 rows \u2192 output:9 rows. 9 is 6 * 1.5. So perhaps every other row is duplicated. For instance, after every two rows, insert a copy of the previous row. Let's check:\n\nOriginal transformed input would be 6 rows. Then inserting a row after the third and sixth rows. Let's see:\n\nOriginal transformed rows:\n\nRow0: [0,2,0]\n\nRow1: [2,2,0]\n\nRow2: [0,2,0]\n\nRow3: [0,2,2]\n\nRow4: [0,2,0]\n\nRow5: [2,2,0]\n\nNow, inserting after row2 (the third row) and after row5 (the sixth row) would add two rows. But that only gives 8. Hmm, not matching. Alternatively, perhaps inserting after each row, but inserting a row that's a copy of the previous one. For example:\n\nOriginal rows 0-5. After each, insert a copy. But that would double to 12. Not the case here.\n\nLooking at Example0's output rows:\n\n0: [0,2,0]\n\n1: [2,2,0]\n\n2: [0,2,0]\n\n3: [0,2,2]\n\n4: [0,2,0]\n\n5: [2,2,0]\n\n6: [0,2,0]\n\n7: [0,2,2]\n\n8: [0,2,0]\n\nWait, the first six rows are the transformed input, and then rows 6-8 are [0,2,0], [0,2,2], [0,2,0], which are the same as rows 2,3,4 of the transformed input. So perhaps after the initial 6 rows, the next three are the transformed input rows starting from row2. That would make the total 9. But why?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is created by repeating the transformed input, but with some overlap. Let's look at other examples.\n\nExample1's input is 6 rows. Output is 9 rows. Let's check if the same pattern applies.\n\nInput Example1:\n\n[0,1,0]\n\n[1,0,1]\n\n[0,1,0]\n\n[1,0,1]\n\n[0,1,0]\n\n[1,0,1]\n\nTransformed output (each 1\u21922):\n\n[0,2,0]\n\n[2,0,2]\n\n[0,2,0]\n\n[2,0,2]\n\n[0,2,0]\n\n[2,0,2]\n\nThen the output has these six rows plus three more:\n\nRow6: [0,2,0]\n\nRow7: [2,0,2]\n\nRow8: [0,2,0]\n\nWhich are the first three rows of the transformed input again. So the output is the transformed input followed by the first three rows again. So total 6 +3=9 rows. So perhaps the pattern is to take the transformed input and then append the first half of it again.\n\nIn Example0, input is 6 rows. The first half would be 3 rows. So transformed input (6 rows) + first 3 rows \u2192 9 rows. Let's check:\n\nExample0's output's last three rows are [0,2,0], [0,2,2], [0,2,0]. Wait, the first three rows of the transformed input are:\n\nRow0: [0,2,0]\n\nRow1: [2,2,0]\n\nRow2: [0,2,0]\n\nSo appending these would give the first six rows, then adding these three again. But in the actual output of Example0, the last three rows are rows 6-8: [0,2,0], [0,2,2], [0,2,0]. Hmm, those are rows 2,3,4 of the transformed input, not the first three. So maybe that's not the pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the transformed input followed by the transformed input again, but starting from the second row. Let me check Example1.\n\nIn Example1, output is:\n\nTransformed input (6 rows) followed by [0,2,0], [2,0,2], [0,2,0]. Those are the first three rows of the transformed input. So 6 +3 =9. So in that case, the pattern is to append the first half of the transformed input to itself.\n\nIn Example0, the transformed input has 6 rows. The first half is 3 rows. So appending them would give 9 rows. Let's see:\n\nOriginal transformed input rows 0-5:\n\n0: [0,2,0]\n\n1: [2,2,0]\n\n2: [0,2,0]\n\n3: [0,2,2]\n\n4: [0,2,0]\n\n5: [2,2,0]\n\nAppending the first three rows (0,1,2):\n\nThen rows6-8 would be [0,2,0], [2,2,0], [0,2,0]. But in the actual output, rows6-8 are [0,2,0], [0,2,2], [0,2,0]. So that doesn't match. So maybe that's not the pattern.\n\nHmm. Let's think differently. Let's look at the input and output for each example and see how the output is structured.\n\nIn Example0's output, after the transformed input rows (6 rows), there are three more rows. Let's see:\n\nOriginal input has 6 rows. Output has 9. So 6 + 3 =9. The three additional rows are [0,2,0], [0,2,2], [0,2,0]. Looking at the transformed input, these rows correspond to rows 2,3,4. So perhaps the last three rows are the middle three rows of the transformed input. Let me check:\n\nTransformed input for Example0 has rows:\n\n0: [0,2,0]\n\n1: [2,2,0]\n\n2: [0,2,0]\n\n3: [0,2,2]\n\n4: [0,2,0]\n\n5: [2,2,0]\n\nMiddle three rows would be 2,3,4. Which are [0,2,0], [0,2,2], [0,2,0]. Which matches the last three rows of the output. So the output is the transformed input followed by rows 2,3,4 of the transformed input. But why those rows?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the transformed input followed by rows 3,4,5 of the transformed input. Wait, no. Because in Example0's output, the last three rows are rows 6,7,8 which are [0,2,0], [0,2,2], [0,2,0]. Those correspond to transformed input rows 2,3,4. So maybe the pattern is to take the transformed input and then append the third, fourth, and fifth rows (indices 2,3,4) again. But that would be adding three rows. So 6+3=9. Let's check in Example1.\n\nExample1's transformed input has 6 rows. The last three rows added in the output are [0,2,0], [2,0,2], [0,2,0], which are rows 0,1,2 of the transformed input. So that doesn't fit the same pattern. Hmm, this approach isn't working.\n\nWait, perhaps the output is created by duplicating certain rows. Let me look at each example's input and output.\n\nIn Example0, the input is six rows. The output is nine rows, which is 6 * 1.5. So maybe every other row is duplicated. Let me check:\n\nTransformed input rows (indices 0-5):\n\n0: [0,2,0]\n\n1: [2,2,0]\n\n2: [0,2,0]\n\n3: [0,2,2]\n\n4: [0,2,0]\n\n5: [2,2,0]\n\nThe output adds after row 5 (index5) rows 6-8: [0,2,0], [0,2,2], [0,2,0]. Those are rows 2,3,4 again. So perhaps after the entire transformed input, append rows 2,3,4.\n\nBut why those rows? Maybe the pattern is to append the middle three rows. If the input is six rows, the middle three are rows 2,3,4. So adding those three at the end. Then total 6+3=9. \n\nIn Example0, that's exactly what's happening. Let's check Example1:\n\nTransformed input rows:\n\n0: [0,2,0]\n\n1: [2,0,2]\n\n2: [0,2,0]\n\n3: [2,0,2]\n\n4: [0,2,0]\n\n5: [2,0,2]\n\nMiddle three rows would be 2,3,4: [0,2,0], [2,0,2], [0,2,0]. Appending those gives:\n\nAfter original 6 rows, add these three. So the output would be 9 rows. But looking at the actual output for Example1, the last three rows are [0,2,0], [2,0,2], [0,2,0]. Which matches the middle three rows. So this seems to fit.\n\nSimilarly, Example2's input is 6 rows. Output is 9. Let's see:\n\nInput Example2's transformed version:\n\n[0,2,0]\n\n[2,2,0]\n\n[0,2,0]\n\n[0,2,0]\n\n[2,2,0]\n\n[0,2,0]\n\nMiddle three rows (2,3,4) are [0,2,0], [0,2,0], [2,2,0]. So appending these three to the transformed input would give the output. The actual output of Example2 ends with:\n\n... (after row5: [0,2,0]) then:\n\n[0,2,0] (row6: same as transformed row2)\n\n[2,2,0] (row7: same as transformed row4?)\n\nWait, the output for Example2 is:\n\nOriginal transformed rows (6):\n\n0: [0,2,0]\n\n1: [2,2,0]\n\n2: [0,2,0]\n\n3: [0,2,0]\n\n4: [2,2,0]\n\n5: [0,2,0]\n\nAppended middle rows (2,3,4): rows 2 is [0,2,0], row3 is [0,2,0], row4 is [2,2,0]. So appended rows would be [0,2,0], [0,2,0], [2,2,0]. Then the output would have:\n\nRow6: [0,2,0]\n\nRow7: [0,2,0]\n\nRow8: [2,2,0]\n\nBut looking at the Example2 output:\n\nThe last three rows are [0,2,0], [2,2,0], [0,2,0]. Hmm, which doesn't match. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake here. Let me check the Example2's output again:\n\nExample2's output:\n\n[0,2,0]\n\n[2,2,0]\n\n[0,2,0]\n\n[0,2,0]\n\n[2,2,0]\n\n[0,2,0]\n\n[0,2,0]\n\n[2,2,0]\n\n[0,2,0]\n\nSo the last three rows are rows6,7,8: [0,2,0], [2,2,0], [0,2,0]. These are the same as transformed input rows 3,4,5. Because row3 in transformed input is [0,2,0], row4 is [2,2,0], row5 is [0,2,0]. So appending rows3,4,5 would give those three. So that's different from Example0 and Example1. So maybe this pattern isn't consistent. Hmm.\n\nWait, this is getting confusing. Let's try another approach. Let's think about the transformation steps. All 1s in the input become 2s. So that's the first step. Then, the output has more rows than the input. So after transforming, there's an expansion of rows. How?\n\nLooking at the output rows in all examples, the number of output rows is 1.5 times the input rows. Because 6 input rows \u21929 output rows (6*1.5=9). So perhaps each input row is transformed into 1.5 rows, but that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps every two input rows generate three output rows. For example, each pair of input rows becomes three output rows, leading to 6 input rows \u2192 9 output rows. Let's check.\n\nExample0's input is 6 rows. If every two input rows generate three output rows, then 6/2=3 groups \u21923*3=9. Let's see:\n\nGroup1: rows0-1: [0,1,0], [1,1,0] \u2192 transformed to [0,2,0], [2,2,0], then maybe insert a copy of the first row again? So output for group1 would be three rows: [0,2,0], [2,2,0], [0,2,0]. Which matches the first three output rows of Example0. Then group2: rows2-3: [0,1,0], [0,1,1] \u2192 transformed to [0,2,0], [0,2,2], and insert [0,2,0] again. Then output rows3-5: [0,2,0], [0,2,2], [0,2,0]. Then group3: rows4-5: [0,1,0], [1,1,0] \u2192 transformed to [0,2,0], [2,2,0], and insert [0,2,0]. So output rows6-8: [0,2,0], [2,2,0], [0,2,0]. But in the actual output, the last three rows are [0,2,0], [0,2,2], [0,2,0]. Hmm, that doesn't align. So maybe this grouping approach isn't correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each input row is followed by inserting a new row. For example, each input row becomes two rows in the output, but not exactly. Because 6 input rows would become 12, but the output has 9. So that's not it.\n\nWait, maybe the output is formed by taking the transformed input and inserting a new row after every two rows. For example, after every two transformed rows, insert a copy of the first row of the next pair. Let me check Example0.\n\nTransformed input rows0-5:\n\n0: [0,2,0]\n\n1: [2,2,0]\n\n2: [0,2,0]\n\n3: [0,2,2]\n\n4: [0,2,0]\n\n5: [2,2,0]\n\nInserting after rows1, 3, 5. So after row1, insert row2. After row3, insert row4. After row5, insert row0 again? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is the transformed input followed by the transformed input again, but only the first half of it. For Example0, transformed input is 6 rows. The first half is 3 rows. So 6+3=9. Let's see:\n\nTransformed input first 3 rows: [0,2,0], [2,2,0], [0,2,0]. Appending these gives the output as:\n\nOriginal 6 rows plus these 3, totaling 9. Let's check:\n\nIn Example0's output, the last three rows are [0,2,0], [0,2,2], [0,2,0]. Which don't match. So that's not the case.\n\nHmm. Let's try to look for a different pattern. Maybe the output is created by repeating the transformed input's rows but inserting copies of certain rows in between.\n\nWait, looking at Example0's output:\n\nThe transformed input rows are followed by [0,2,0], [0,2,2], [0,2,0]. Which are the same as transformed input rows 2,3,4. So maybe after the entire transformed input, append rows starting from row2 up to row4. So that's three rows. Similarly, in Example1:\n\nTransformed input rows are followed by rows 0,1,2. So in that case, appending the first three rows. So there's inconsistency. Maybe the pattern isn't about appending certain rows but rather a different transformation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each input row is transformed into two output rows: the original transformed row and a modified version. But how? Let's look at Example0's input row0: [0,1,0] \u2192 [0,2,0]. Then maybe insert a row after it. But where would the additional rows come from?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each input row is duplicated, but with some modification. For example, every other row is transformed and then duplicated. Not sure.\n\nWait, another idea: the output is the transformed input where each row is followed by a copy of itself, but only for certain rows. For example, in Example0, after the first row [0,2,0], there's no duplication, but after the second row [2,2,0], there's the third row [0,2,0], which is not a duplicate. Hmm, this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the transformed input with some rows repeated. For example, in Example0's output, row0 is [0,2,0], row2 is same, row4 same, row6 same. So perhaps every even-indexed row is the same. But this isn't helpful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is created by taking the transformed input and then inserting a copy of the third row after the fifth row. Not sure.\n\nLet me look at the problem from a different angle. What's the difference between the input and output in terms of their structure? The output has 1.5 times the number of rows. So each input row corresponds to 1.5 output rows. How can that happen? Maybe every two input rows produce three output rows. Let's test this.\n\nSuppose for every two input rows, we generate three output rows. For example:\n\nInput rows 0 and 1 \u2192 output rows 0, 1, 2.\n\nBut how?\n\nLooking at Example0's input:\n\nRows0-1: [0,1,0], [1,1,0]\n\nTransformed to [0,2,0], [2,2,0]. Then perhaps insert a copy of row0 again. So output rows0-2: [0,2,0], [2,2,0], [0,2,0]. Then rows2-3 of input: [0,1,0], [0,1,1] \u2192 transformed to [0,2,0], [0,2,2]. Insert a copy of row2 \u2192 [0,2,0]. So output rows3-5: [0,2,0], [0,2,2], [0,2,0]. Then input rows4-5: [0,1,0], [1,1,0] \u2192 transformed to [0,2,0], [2,2,0]. Insert copy of row4 \u2192 [0,2,0]. So output rows6-8: [0,2,0], [2,2,0], [0,2,0]. This matches Example0's output. \n\nSo the pattern here is: for every pair of input rows (two rows), after transforming them (replacing 1s with 2s), we add a third row which is a copy of the first row of the pair. So each pair becomes three rows. \n\nLet's check this with Example0:\n\nInput pairs:\n\nPair1: row0 and row1 \u2192 transformed to row0 and row1. Then add a copy of row0 \u2192 three rows: row0, row1, row0.\n\nBut in Example0's output, after row0 and row1 comes row2 which is [0,2,0], which is the transformed row0 again. So yes.\n\nPair2: rows2 and3 \u2192 transformed to rows2 and3. Then add copy of row2 \u2192 [0,2,0]. So output rows2,3,4 \u2192 [0,2,0], [0,2,2], [0,2,0].\n\nPair3: rows4 and5 \u2192 transformed to rows4 and5. Add copy of row4 \u2192 [0,2,0]. So output rows4,5,6 \u2192 [0,2,0], [2,2,0], [0,2,0]. Wait, but in the actual output of Example0, the last three rows are [0,2,0], [0,2,2], [0,2,0]. Hmm, maybe I'm not grouping the pairs correctly.\n\nWait, perhaps the input is divided into overlapping pairs. For example, rows0-1, then rows1-2, etc. But that would lead to more rows. Alternatively, maybe the input is grouped into consecutive pairs without overlapping. For six input rows, there are three pairs (0-1, 2-3, 4-5). Each pair produces three rows. So 3 pairs *3 rows =9 output rows. \n\nLet's test this for Example0:\n\nPair0: rows0-1 \u2192 transformed to [0,2,0], [2,2,0]. Add a copy of row0's transformed row \u2192 [0,2,0]. So the three rows are [0,2,0], [2,2,0], [0,2,0]. These are the first three output rows.\n\nPair1: rows2-3 \u2192 transformed to [0,2,0], [0,2,2]. Add copy of row2's transformed \u2192 [0,2,0]. So three rows: [0,2,0], [0,2,2], [0,2,0]. Which are output rows3-5.\n\nPair2: rows4-5 \u2192 transformed to [0,2,0], [2,2,0]. Add copy of row4's transformed \u2192 [0,2,0]. So three rows: [0,2,0], [2,2,0], [0,2,0]. Which would be output rows6-8.\n\nBut the actual output of Example0 is:\n\nRows0-2: [0,2,0], [2,2,0], [0,2,0]\n\nRows3-5: [0,2,2], [0,2,0], [2,2,0]\n\nRows6-8: [0,2,0], [0,2,2], [0,2,0]\n\nWait, that doesn't align with the expected pairs. So perhaps this isn't the correct grouping.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the pairs are rows0-1, rows2-3, rows4-5, but the third row added is the first row of the next pair. But that complicates things.\n\nHmm, perhaps I need to think of the output as being the transformed input with each row followed by a certain row. For instance, after each transformed row, insert a specific row. Let's look at Example0's output:\n\nTransformed rows0-5:\n\n0: [0,2,0]\n\n1: [2,2,0]\n\n2: [0,2,0]\n\n3: [0,2,2]\n\n4: [0,2,0]\n\n5: [2,2,0]\n\nThen the output rows6-8 are [0,2,0], [0,2,2], [0,2,0]. Which are the same as rows2,3,4. So perhaps after the entire transformed input, we append rows2,3,4.\n\nBut why those rows? It seems arbitrary, but maybe the pattern is that after transforming the entire input, append the transformed rows starting from the third row (index 2) for three rows. Let's check this in the examples.\n\nIn Example0:\n\nAppend rows2-4 \u2192 three rows: [0,2,0], [0,2,2], [0,2,0]. Which matches the output.\n\nExample1's transformed input rows:\n\n0: [0,2,0]\n\n1: [2,0,2]\n\n2: [0,2,0]\n\n3: [2,0,2]\n\n4: [0,2,0]\n\n5: [2,0,2]\n\nAppending rows2-4: [0,2,0], [2,0,2], [0,2,0]. Which are the last three rows of Example1's output. Which matches.\n\nExample2's transformed input rows:\n\n0: [0,2,0]\n\n1: [2,2,0]\n\n2: [0,2,0]\n\n3: [0,2,0]\n\n4: [2,2,0]\n\n5: [0,2,0]\n\nAppending rows2-4: [0,2,0], [0,2,0], [2,2,0]. But the actual output ends with [0,2,0], [2,2,0], [0,2,0]. Which are rows3,4,5. Wait, no. So this pattern holds for Examples0 and 1 but not Example2.\n\nHmm, so maybe the pattern isn't consistent across examples. This is tricky. Let's try to find another approach.\n\nAnother observation: in all examples, the output rows are all transformed input rows (1\u21922) followed by some additional rows. The additional rows are exactly the same as the transformed input rows, but starting from a certain point. For example:\n\nExample0: additional rows are transformed input rows2,3,4.\n\nExample1: additional rows are transformed input rows0,1,2.\n\nExample2: additional rows are transformed input rows3,4,5.\n\nWait, this doesn't seem to follow a consistent rule. So perhaps the pattern is different.\n\nWait, looking at the test input:\n\nTest Input:\n\n[1,1,1]\n\n[0,1,0]\n\n[0,1,0]\n\n[1,1,1]\n\n[0,1,0]\n\n[0,1,0]\n\nThis has 6 rows. Following the pattern from the examples, the transformed input would replace 1s with 2s. Then, append three more rows which are certain rows from the transformed input.\n\nBut how to determine which rows to append.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the transformed input followed by a repetition of the transformed input's first three rows. Let's test this:\n\nExample0 has 6 transformed rows, then appending first three gives 9 rows. But in Example0, the appended rows are rows2-4, not first three.\n\nAlternatively, the appended rows are the transformed input's rows2-4 in Example0, rows0-2 in Example1, and rows3-5 in Example2. This seems arbitrary. Maybe there's another pattern.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is created by repeating the transformed input's rows, but shifted. For example, the output is the transformed input followed by the transformed input shifted by one row. But that would give 12 rows, which is not the case.\n\nAlternatively, think about the test input. Let's transform it:\n\nTest input:\n\nRow0: [1,1,1] \u2192 [2,2,2]\n\nRow1: [0,1,0] \u2192 [0,2,0]\n\nRow2: [0,1,0] \u2192 [0,2,0]\n\nRow3: [1,1,1] \u2192 [2,2,2]\n\nRow4: [0,1,0] \u2192 [0,2,0]\n\nRow5: [0,1,0] \u2192 [0,2,0]\n\nSo transformed input is:\n\n[2,2,2]\n\n[0,2,0]\n\n[0,2,0]\n\n[2,2,2]\n\n[0,2,0]\n\n[0,2,0]\n\nNow, according to the pattern from the examples, after transforming, we append three more rows. But which ones?\n\nIn Example0, the appended rows were the middle three transformed rows (2,3,4). In Example1, appended rows were the first three. In Example2, it's the last three. This inconsistency is puzzling. Perhaps there's a different rule.\n\nAlternatively, the appended three rows are the transformed input's rows that are in the middle. For an even number of rows, perhaps the middle three are rows 2,3,4. For example, 6 rows: indices 0-5. Middle three would be 2,3,4.\n\nExample0's appended rows are 2,3,4. Example1's appended rows are 0,1,2. Hmm, this doesn't fit. Maybe not.\n\nAnother angle: the input in the examples has a certain symmetry. For example, Example0's input seems to have a repeating pattern. Perhaps the output is created by mirroring or repeating certain parts.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is the transformed input followed by the transformed input again, but with some rows omitted. For Example0, the output has the transformed input followed by rows2-4. But I don't see a clear pattern here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is created by taking the transformed input and then adding a copy of the third row of the transformed input after each original row. But that doesn't seem to fit.\n\nWait, let's look at the test input's structure. The input has:\n\nRow0: [1,1,1]\n\nRow1: [0,1,0]\n\nRow2: [0,1,0]\n\nRow3: [1,1,1]\n\nRow4: [0,1,0]\n\nRow5: [0,1,0]\n\nSo it's two groups of [1,1,1], followed by two [0,1,0], and then repeated. So perhaps after transformation, the output would be the transformed input followed by rows from the transformed input that are part of the repeating pattern.\n\nBut how?\n\nAlternatively, considering that the examples append certain rows, maybe the appended rows are the same as the first three transformed rows of the test input. But I'm not sure.\n\nThis is really challenging. Let's try to find a pattern in the training examples again.\n\nLooking at Example0's output:\n\nThe appended rows after the transformed input are rows2,3,4. Which are [0,2,0], [0,2,2], [0,2,0]. \n\nExample1's appended rows are rows0,1,2: [0,2,0], [2,0,2], [0,2,0].\n\nExample2's appended rows are rows3,4,5: [0,2,0], [2,2,0], [0,2,0].\n\nSo the appended rows are the middle three rows for even-numbered examples and the first or last three for others? Or perhaps it depends on the input's structure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the number of appended rows is equal to the number of unique rows in the input. But that's not clear.\n\nAnother idea: the appended rows are the transformed input rows that are the same as the first row of the transformed input. But in Example0, the first row is [0,2,0], and the appended rows include that. Similarly, in Example1, the first row is [0,2,0], which is in the appended rows. But in Example2, the first row is [0,2,0], and the appended rows have that as well. So perhaps the appended rows are three copies of the first transformed row. But no, because in Example0, the appended rows are three different rows, including [0,2,0], [0,2,2], [0,2,0].\n\nAlternatively, the appended rows are formed by taking the transformed input and then appending the first three rows of the transformed input. But Example0 doesn't fit that.\n\nThis is really tough. Maybe I should look for another pattern. Let's look at the number of 1s in each input row and how they're transformed.\n\nIn all examples, 1s become 2s. The output has more rows, but the 0s remain. The main difference is the number of rows. So the key is the row expansion pattern.\n\nIn each training example, the output is the transformed input followed by three more rows. These three rows are determined by the original input. Let's see:\n\nExample0's input has rows:\n\n0: [0,1,0]\n\n1: [1,1,0]\n\n2: [0,1,0]\n\n3: [0,1,1]\n\n4: [0,1,0]\n\n5: [1,1,0]\n\nTransformed and appended rows are [0,2,0], [0,2,2], [0,2,0]. Which are rows 2,3,4 of the transformed input. \n\nExample1's input has rows:\n\n0: [0,1,0]\n\n1: [1,0,1]\n\n2: [0,1,0]\n\n3: [1,0,1]\n\n4: [0,1,0]\n\n5: [1,0,1]\n\nAppended rows are [0,2,0], [2,0,2], [0,2,0]. Which are rows0,1,2 of the transformed input.\n\nExample2's input rows:\n\n0: [0,1,0]\n\n1: [1,1,0]\n\n2: [0,1,0]\n\n3: [0,1,0]\n\n4: [1,1,0]\n\n5: [0,1,0]\n\nAppended rows are [0,2,0], [2,2,0], [0,2,0]. Which are rows3,4,5 of the transformed input.\n\nHmm. So the appended rows vary between examples. But why?\n\nLooking at the input of Example0, the appended rows are the third, fourth, and fifth rows of the transformed input. Example1's appended rows are the first three. Example2's appended rows are the last three. \n\nIs there a commonality in how the appended rows are chosen? For example, the appended rows are the three middle rows of the transformed input for even-numbered examples, or based on some other property.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the appended rows are determined by the original input's pattern. For example, in Example0, the input has a certain symmetry which dictates which rows are appended. But I can't see it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the appended rows are the same as the transformed input's rows starting from the row where the first occurrence of a particular pattern occurs.\n\nAlternatively, think about the test input. Let's imagine transformed test input:\n\nRow0: [2,2,2]\n\nRow1: [0,2,0]\n\nRow2: [0,2,0]\n\nRow3: [2,2,2]\n\nRow4: [0,2,0]\n\nRow5: [0,2,0]\n\nFollowing the pattern of the training examples, the output would be the transformed input followed by three appended rows. The question is, which three rows?\n\nLooking at the training examples, the appended rows seem to depend on the structure of the input. For example, in Example0, the input has a kind of 'wave' pattern with 1s. The appended rows might be the middle part of the wave. But this is vague.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the appended rows are the rows from the transformed input that form a certain pattern. For example, in Example0, the appended rows are the ones with 2s in the second and third positions (row3: [0,2,2], row4: [0,2,0]). Not sure.\n\nAnother idea: Maybe the appended rows are the transformed input's rows starting from the third row. For Example0, appended rows are 2-4. For Example1, appended rows are 0-2. For Example2, appended rows are 3-5. There's no clear index-based pattern.\n\nAlternatively, the appended rows are the transformed input's rows starting from the row after the first occurrence of a row with two 2s. For example, in Example0, row1 is [2,2,0], then the appended rows start from row2. But in Example1, the first row with two 2s is row1 (transformed row1 is [2,0,2]). So appended rows start from row0. This doesn't make sense.\n\nI'm stuck. Let's try to hypothesize based on the examples and the test input.\n\nThe test input's transformed rows are:\n\n0: [2,2,2]\n\n1: [0,2,0]\n\n2: [0,2,0]\n\n3: [2,2,2]\n\n4: [0,2,0]\n\n5: [0,2,0]\n\nNow, looking for a pattern similar to the training examples. For instance, in Example0, the appended rows were the middle three (rows2-4). The test input has two blocks of [2,2,2] followed by two [0,2,0], then repeats. The middle three rows of the transformed test input are rows2,3,4: [0,2,0], [2,2,2], [0,2,0]. Appending these would make the output:\n\nTransformed input (6 rows) followed by rows2,3,4. So the output would have 9 rows:\n\n0: [2,2,2]\n\n1: [0,2,0]\n\n2: [0,2,0]\n\n3: [2,2,2]\n\n4: [0,2,0]\n\n5: [0,2,0]\n\n6: [0,2,0]\n\n7: [2,2,2]\n\n8: [0,2,0]\n\nBut looking at the training examples, the appended rows are three in number. So this would fit. But is this the correct pattern?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the appended rows are the middle three of the transformed input. For six rows, middle three are rows2,3,4. So for the test input, appending rows2,3,4:\n\nRow2: [0,2,0]\n\nRow3: [2,2,2]\n\nRow4: [0,2,0]\n\nSo appended rows are [0,2,0], [2,2,2], [0,2,0]. \n\nThus, the output would be:\n\n[2,2,2]\n\n[0,2,0]\n\n[0,2,0]\n\n[2,2,2]\n\n[0,2,0]\n\n[0,2,0]\n\n[0,2,0]\n\n[2,2,2]\n\n[0,2,0]\n\nWhich seems plausible. But does this align with the training examples' patterns?\n\nExample0's appended rows were rows2-4: [0,2,0], [0,2,2], [0,2,0]. Which are the middle three. \n\nExample1's input has 6 rows, middle three are rows2,3,4. Transformed rows2-4: [0,2,0], [2,0,2], [0,2,0]. Appending these would result in the output's last three rows. But in Example1's actual output, the appended rows are [0,2,0], [2,0,2], [0,2,0], which match the middle three. So this seems to hold.\n\nExample2's input has 6 rows. Middle three are rows2,3,4: transformed rows are [0,2,0], [0,2,0], [2,2,0]. Appending these would be the output's last three rows. But in Example2's actual output, the last three rows are [0,2,0], [2,2,0], [0,2,0], which are rows3,4,5. So this contradicts the hypothesis.\n\nHmm, this inconsistency makes me doubt the pattern. But perhaps Example2's input middle three rows are different. Let's check:\n\nExample2's input:\n\nRows0: [0,1,0]\n\n1: [1,1,0]\n\n2: [0,1,0]\n\n3: [0,1,0]\n\n4: [1,1,0]\n\n5: [0,1,0]\n\nTransformed rows2,3,4 are [0,2,0], [0,2,0], [2,2,0]. But the appended rows in the output are [0,2,0], [2,2,0], [0,2,0], which are rows3,4,5. So the appended rows are not the middle three. So this pattern doesn't hold for Example2.\n\nThis is really confusing. Given the time I've spent and the possibility that the correct pattern is to replace 1s with 2s and append the middle three rows of the transformed input, I'll proceed with that for the test input.\n\nThus, for the test input, the transformed rows are:\n\n0: [2,2,2]\n\n1: [0,2,0]\n\n2: [0,2,0]\n\n3: [2,2,2]\n\n4: [0,2,0]\n\n5: [0,2,0]\n\nMiddle three rows (2,3,4) are:\n\nRow2: [0,2,0]\n\nRow3: [2,2,2]\n\nRow4: [0,2,0]\n\nAppending these three rows gives the output as:\n\n[2,2,2]\n\n[0,2,0]\n\n[0,2,0]\n\n[2,2,2]\n\n[0,2,0]\n\n[0,2,0]\n\n[0,2,0]\n\n[2,2,2]\n\n[0,2,0]\n\nBut let's verify this against Example2. If Example2's input's middle three rows are rows2,3,4, then appending them would give rows2,3,4: [0,2,0], [0,2,0], [2,2,0]. But the actual output's appended rows are [0,2,0], [2,2,0], [0,2,0], which are rows3,4,5. So this doesn't fit. Therefore, the pattern must be different.\n\nAlternative approach: Let's consider that the output is formed by repeating each transformed row once except for certain rows which are repeated twice. For example, in Example0's output, each row is present twice except the third row. But I'm not sure.\n\nAnother idea: The output has the transformed input followed by the transformed input but starting from the second row. For Example0:\n\nTransformed input is rows0-5. Then appended rows are rows2-5. But that would give more than 9 rows. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, the output is the transformed input followed by the transformed input's first three rows. For Example0, that would be 6+3=9 rows. Let's check:\n\nTransformed input's first three rows are [0,2,0], [2,2,0], [0,2,0]. Appending these would make the output's last three rows. But in the actual output, the last three are [0,2,0], [0,2,2], [0,2,0]. So no.\n\nAt this point, given the time I've spent and the need to provide an answer, I'll make an educated guess based on the training examples. The pattern seems to be that after transforming the input by replacing 1s with 2s, we append the middle three rows of the transformed input. For even-numbered rows, the middle three are rows 2,3,4. For the test input with six rows, the middle three are rows2,3,4. So the appended rows would be [0,2,0], [2,2,2], [0,2,0]. Thus, the final output would be the transformed input followed by these three rows."
