        "cot_1": "Okay, let's tackle this puzzle. So, the task is to find the pattern in the training examples and apply it to the test input. Let me look at the examples carefully.\n\nStarting with Example 0. The input is four rows of numbers, each with four elements. The output is also four rows, each with four elements. Let's compare the input and output for each row.\n\nFirst input row: [6,6,6,2]. Output is [2,6,6,6]. Hmm, it looks like the 2 moved from the end to the beginning. But wait, the other elements are 6s, so maybe the 2 is rotated to the front?\n\nLooking at the second input row: [6,1,6,2]. Output is [2,6,1,6]. Again, the 2 is now at the start. The rest of the elements are the same but shifted. So perhaps the rightmost element (the 2) is moved to the front, and the others shift right? Like a right rotation once?\n\nThird input row: [7,2,7,2]. Output is [2,7,2,7]. Original last element is 2, which is moved to front. Then the rest follow: 7,2,7. Wait, original was [7,2,7,2], moving last 2 to front gives [2,7,2,7]. Yes. Then the fourth input row: [1,7,2,2] becomes [2,2,7,1]. Wait, the last element is 2, moving it to front would give [2,1,7,2], but the output is [2,2,7,1]. Hmm, that doesn't fit. So maybe there's a different pattern here.\n\nWait, maybe instead of moving the last element to the front, there's another operation. Let me check the example again. For the fourth input row [1,7,2,2], the output is [2,2,7,1]. So the original elements are 1,7,2,2. The output starts with 2, then 2, then 7, then 1. So the last two elements (2,2) are moved to the front, and the first two (1,7) are moved to the end? That would make sense. Wait, let's see:\n\nOriginal: [1,7,2,2]\nIf we take the last two elements [2,2] and put them first, then followed by the first two elements reversed? Or maybe not reversed. Let's see: first two elements are 1,7. If after moving last two to front, then adding first two, but output is [2,2,7,1]. Wait, that's 2,2 followed by 7,1. The original first two were 1,7. So maybe after moving last two to front, the remaining elements are reversed? So original first two elements are 1,7. Reversed would be 7,1. So the output would be [2,2] + [7,1] = [2,2,7,1]. Yes, that works. So perhaps the pattern is taking the last k elements and moving them to the front, then reversing the remaining elements. But how do we determine k?\n\nWait, in the first example, for each row, how many elements are moved? Let's check:\n\nFirst input row [6,6,6,2] becomes [2,6,6,6]. So the last element (2) is moved to front. Then the first three elements [6,6,6] remain in order. So k=1 here. But in the fourth input row [1,7,2,2], moving last two elements (2,2) to front gives [2,2,1,7], but output is [2,2,7,1]. So maybe after moving the last two, the remaining elements are reversed. Original remaining elements are 1,7. Reversed to 7,1. So the output becomes [2,2] + [7,1] = [2,2,7,1]. That works.\n\nBut then the first example's first row: last element (2) is moved to front, then remaining elements [6,6,6] are kept as is. So in that case, k=1 and the rest are not reversed. Hmm, that's conflicting. So maybe the number of elements moved to the front is equal to the number of 2s in the row? Let's check.\n\nIn Example 0:\n\nFirst input row [6,6,6,2] has one 2. Output moves that 2 to front. The rest are in order. So k=1.\n\nSecond input row [6,1,6,2] also has one 2. So k=1. Output [2,6,1,6]. So moving 2 to front, then the rest are [6,1,6] as is. But wait, original row is [6,1,6,2]. After moving 2 to front, the first three elements are [6,1,6], but output is [2,6,1,6]. So yes, that's just moving 2 to front.\n\nThird input row [7,2,7,2]. There are two 2s. Output is [2,7,2,7]. So moving the last two elements (7,2) \u2192 wait, no. Wait, the original row is [7,2,7,2]. The last element is 2. Moving it to front would give [2,7,2,7], which matches the output. But that's just moving one element again. Wait, but there are two 2s in the input. So maybe the number of elements to move is the number of 2s in the row.\n\nWait, the first example's fourth input row [1,7,2,2] has two 2s. So moving two elements (the last two 2s) to front, then the remaining elements [1,7] are reversed to [7,1]. So the output is [2,2,7,1]. So that fits.\n\nSo the pattern seems to be: For each row, count the number of 2s in that row. Then move that many elements from the end of the row to the front, then reverse the remaining elements.\n\nWait, let's check this.\n\nTake the first example's first row: [6,6,6,2]. Number of 2s is 1. So move 1 element from the end (2) to front. The remaining elements are [6,6,6]. Reversed? No, because in the output, they are [6,6,6], which is the same as the original. So maybe the remaining elements are reversed only if the count of 2s is even? Or perhaps not. Wait, the third example's third input row [7,2,7,2] has two 2s. So move two elements from the end. The original row is [7,2,7,2]. The last two elements are 7,2. Moving them to front gives [7,2,7,2]. But the output is [2,7,2,7]. Wait, that doesn't fit. So maybe the count of 2s determines how many elements to move, but after moving, the remaining elements are reversed.\n\nWait, let's re-express:\n\nFor each row:\n\n1. Count the number of 2s in the row (n).\n2. Take the last n elements and move them to the front.\n3. Reverse the remaining elements (those that were originally before the last n elements) and append them after the moved elements.\n\nLet me test this with the first example's first row:\n\nRow: [6,6,6,2]. Number of 2s is 1. So n=1.\n\nTake last 1 element: [2]. Move to front. Remaining elements are [6,6,6]. Reverse them? [6,6,6] reversed is same. So output [2,6,6,6]. Correct.\n\nSecond row: [6,1,6,2]. n=1. Last element 2 moved to front. Remaining [6,1,6]. Reverse? No, output is [2,6,1,6]. So the remaining elements are kept in original order. So maybe step 3 is not reversing. Hmm, that's conflicting.\n\nThird row in example 0: [7,2,7,2]. Number of 2s is 2. So n=2. Take last two elements [7,2]. Move to front. Remaining elements are [7,2]. Reverse them \u2192 [2,7]. So the output becomes [7,2,2,7]? But actual output is [2,7,2,7]. So that's not matching.\n\nWait, original input row: [7,2,7,2]. Output is [2,7,2,7]. So how does that happen? The last two elements are 7,2. Moving them to front gives [7,2,7,2]. Then the first two elements (7,2) and the remaining elements (7,2). But output is [2,7,2,7]. So perhaps after moving the last n elements to front, the entire array is reversed. Or maybe after moving, the entire array is rotated or something else.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the count of 2s determines the number of elements to reverse in the row. Let's think differently.\n\nLooking at Example 0's fourth row input [1,7,2,2]. The output is [2,2,7,1]. There are two 2s. So if we reverse the entire row, we get [2,2,7,1], which is the output. Wait, original input is [1,7,2,2]. Reversed gives [2,2,7,1]. Which matches the output. But why isn't this applied to other rows?\n\nIn example 0's first row, input [6,6,6,2], reversed would be [2,6,6,6], which matches the output. Second row input [6,1,6,2] reversed is [2,6,1,6], which matches the output. Third row input [7,2,7,2] reversed is [2,7,2,7], which is the output. Fourth row as discussed. So all rows in Example 0 are reversed. But then why in Example 1, the outputs aren't simply reversed?\n\nWait looking at Example 1's input:\n\nFirst input row: [7,7,7,6,6,6,2]. Output is [2,6,6,6,7,7,7]. If reversed, original input is [7,7,7,6,6,6,2], reversed would be [2,6,6,6,7,7,7], which matches. So perhaps the pattern is to reverse the entire row. But then in Example 1's second input row:\n\nInput: [6,7,1,1,7,7,1]. Output: [1,7,7,1,1,7,6]. Reversed of input is [1,7,7,1,1,7,6], which matches. Third input row: [7,7,2,1,2,6,6]. Output is [6,6,2,1,2,7,7]. Reversed input is [6,6,2,1,2,7,7], which matches. Fourth row input [2,2,7,7,7,2,2] reversed is same as output, which matches. Fifth row input [7,2,7,1,2,7,2]. Reversed is [2,7,2,1,7,2,7], which matches the output. Sixth input row [6,6,6,2,2,1,1] reversed gives [1,1,2,2,6,6,6], which matches output. Seventh input row [6,2,6,6,6,6,6] reversed is [6,6,6,6,6,2,6], which matches output. So in Example 1, all rows are reversed. \n\nBut wait, what about Example 2? Let's check.\n\nExample 2's first input row: [1,2,7,1,1,1]. Output is [1,1,1,7,2,1]. Reversed input would be [1,1,1,7,2,1], but the input is [1,2,7,1,1,1], reversed is [1,1,1,7,2,1]. Which matches. Second input row [2,1,7,7,2,6] output [6,2,7,7,1,2]. Reversed input is [6,2,7,7,1,2]. Which matches. Third row input [2,1,2,6,2,1]. Output [1,2,6,2,1,2]. Reversed input is [1,2,6,2,1,2]. Which matches. Fourth input row [1,2,1,7,6,2] reversed is [2,6,7,1,2,1], which matches output. Fifth input row [2,7,1,2,7,1] reversed is [1,7,2,1,7,2], which is the output. Sixth input row [2,1,6,2,7,7] reversed is [7,7,2,6,1,2], which matches output. \n\nSo all examples are simply reversing the order of the elements in each row. But why did the user think there's a more complex pattern? Because when I first looked at Example 0's fourth row, the reversed gives the correct output, which is the same as the example. So perhaps the pattern is simply reversing each row. \n\nBut why are the training examples all showing reversed outputs? Let me confirm.\n\nYes, all the training examples' outputs are reversed versions of their inputs. So the pattern is: for each row in the input, reverse the order of elements to get the output.\n\nNow, let's test this on the test input. The test input is:\n\nTest Input:\n[7,6,1]\n[6,7,6]\n[6,2,2]\n\nIf we reverse each row, the outputs should be:\n\n[1,6,7]\n[6,7,6] (since reversing [6,7,6] gives the same)\n[2,2,6]\n\nWait, the third row is [6,2,2]. Reversed would be [2,2,6], which matches the third output row. So applying the reversal to each row would give the expected output.\n\nBut wait, looking at the examples again, the outputs are reversed rows. So the answer should be the reversed rows of the test input.\n\nBut let me check again. For example, in Example 0's fourth row: input [1,7,2,2], output [2,2,7,1], which is reversed. So yes, it fits.\n\nSo the pattern is simply reversing each row. Then the test input's output would be the reversed rows.",

        "cot_2": "Okay, let's look at the training examples to figure out the pattern here. So the input and output are both lists of numbers. Let's compare them.\n\nStarting with Example 0. The input is four rows:\n\n[6,6,6,2]\n[6,1,6,2]\n[7,2,7,2]\n[1,7,2,2]\n\nThe output for each row seems rearranged. Let's check each row.\n\nFirst input row: [6,6,6,2] \u2192 Output [2,6,6,6]. So the 2 moved to the front. Second input row: [6,1,6,2] \u2192 Output [2,6,1,6]. Again, the 2 is first. Third input [7,2,7,2] \u2192 [2,7,2,7]. Here, the two 2s are now first and third. Wait, original was [7,2,7,2], output swaps the positions? Let's see indices. Input indices 0:7, 1:2, 2:7, 3:2. Output is [2,7,2,7]. So maybe the 2s are moved to the even indices? Or perhaps rotated?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the first occurrence of 2 is moved to the start. Let's check other examples. Example 0's fourth input row [1,7,2,2] \u2192 output [2,2,7,1]. Here, the two 2s from the end are moved to the front. So perhaps the 2s in the input are being moved to the front of the list, in their original order, and the rest of the elements follow in their original order, but after the 2s. So collect all 2s first, then the remaining elements.\n\nWait in example 0's first input row: [6,6,6,2]. The 2 is at the end. Output is [2,6,6,6]. So yes, 2 comes first, then the other elements in order. Second input row [6,1,6,2] \u2192 [2,6,1,6]. The 2 is moved to front, others remain in original order. Third input [7,2,7,2]. The 2s are in positions 1 and 3. Output is [2,7,2,7]. So the 2s are moved to positions 0 and 2, then the remaining elements (7,7) are placed in the remaining positions. So perhaps the 2s are placed first in the order they appear, then the other elements in their original order. Let's test this.\n\nIn the third input row: original elements are 7,2,7,2. The 2s are at index 1 and 3. So collect them first \u2192 [2,2], then the remaining elements are 7 and 7. So output should be [2,2,7,7] but the actual output is [2,7,2,7]. Hmm, that's different. So maybe the 2s are moved to the front but interleaved with the other numbers. Wait, how does that work?\n\nWait the input [7,2,7,2] becomes [2,7,2,7]. So the 2s are placed in positions 0 and 2, and the 7s in positions 1 and 3. So the 2s are at even indices (0-based) and the others at odd. Maybe the 2s are shifted to the start but in their original positions? No, because in the first example, the 2 is at the end. So maybe the 2s are collected first, then the rest follow. But in the third input, the 2s are not consecutive. Wait, maybe the pattern is to reverse each row and then rotate in some way. Let me check another example.\n\nLooking at Example 1. The input is:\n\n[7,7,7,6,6,6,2]\nOutput is [2,6,6,6,7,7,7]\n\nSo here, the 2 is moved to front, then the 6s, then 7s. Original order after the 2: the original elements were 7,7,7,6,6,6,2. So moving the 2 to front, then the rest in their original order except the 2. So the 2 is first, followed by 6s, then 7s. But wait, the original elements after the 2 are 7,7,7,6,6,6, then 2. So when 2 is moved to front, the rest of the elements (excluding 2) are 7,7,7,6,6,6. But in the output, they are arranged as 6,6,6,7,7,7. So the order of the remaining elements is reversed. Because original remaining elements are 7,7,7,6,6,6. Output has them as 6,6,6,7,7,7. So that's reversed.\n\nSo for each row, the 2s are moved to the front, and then the remaining elements are reversed.\n\nWait let's check Example 0 again. For the first input row [6,6,6,2], output is [2,6,6,6]. The remaining elements after removing 2 are [6,6,6], reversed would still be [6,6,6]. So that works. The second input row [6,1,6,2] \u2192 output [2,6,1,6]. Remaining elements after 2: [6,1,6], reversed is [6,1,6] same as original. Wait no, [6,1,6] reversed is [6,1,6]? No, reversed would be [6,1,6] becomes [6,1,6] if reversed. Wait no, wait [6,1,6] reversed is [6,1,6] reversed \u2192 [6,1,6] is same as original. Wait, no, wait the original after 2 is [6,1,6]. Reversed would be [6,1,6] \u2192 same as original. So in the output, it's [2,6,1,6]. So that matches. Then the third input row [7,2,7,2] \u2192 output [2,7,2,7]. The 2s are moved to front, but there are two 2s. So first collect all 2s in their original order, then reverse the remaining elements. The original elements are [7,2,7,2]. So 2s are at positions 1 and 3. Collect them: [2,2]. Then the remaining elements are 7 and 7. Reversed \u2192 [7,7]. So combined, [2,2,7,7]. But the actual output is [2,7,2,7]. Hmm, that doesn't fit. So maybe the remaining elements are kept in their original order, but with the 2s in their original positions. So maybe not the reverse. So this approach might be incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the elements after the first 2 are reversed, but that also doesn't fit.\n\nLet me look at Example 2. Let's take the first input row [1,2,7,1,1,1]. Output is [1,1,1,7,2,1]. Wait, the original has a 2 at position 1. The output's 2 is at position 4. So that's not moving 2 to front. So maybe my initial idea was wrong.\n\nWait Example 2's input first row is [1,2,7,1,1,1]. Output [1,1,1,7,2,1]. So the 2 is in the fourth position. So the initial approach of moving 2s to front doesn't hold here. So that pattern isn't applicable. So perhaps I need a different approach.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each row is rotated. Let's check. For example 0's first input [6,6,6,2] becomes [2,6,6,6]. That looks like a rotation by 3 to the right. But another example: the second input [6,1,6,2] \u2192 [2,6,1,6]. That's rotating to the right by 3? 6,1,6,2 \u2192 rotating once to the right gives 2,6,1,6. Yes, exactly. So rotation by one position to the right. Wait if the input is [6,6,6,2], rotating right once would be [2,6,6,6], which matches the output. The second input [6,1,6,2] rotated right once becomes [2,6,1,6], which matches. Third input [7,2,7,2] rotated right once \u2192 [2,7,2,7], which matches the output. Fourth input [1,7,2,2] rotated right once \u2192 [2,1,7,2]. But the output is [2,2,7,1]. Hmm, that doesn't fit. So maybe not a rotation. So that idea might not work.\n\nWait for the fourth input of Example 0: input [1,7,2,2]. Rotating right once would be [2,1,7,2], but the output is [2,2,7,1]. So that's different. So rotation is not the pattern.\n\nAnother approach: perhaps split the array into parts. For Example 0, input [6,6,6,2] becomes [2,6,6,6]. So maybe the last element is moved to the front. That works for the first row. Second input [6,1,6,2] \u2192 last element is 2, moved to front \u2192 [2,6,1,6], which matches. Third input [7,2,7,2] \u2192 last element is 2 \u2192 moved to front gives [2,7,2,7], which matches. Fourth input [1,7,2,2] \u2192 last element is 2. Moving to front gives [2,1,7,2], but the output is [2,2,7,1]. So that's not matching. So this idea works for the first three rows but not the fourth.\n\nHmm, so maybe the pattern is different. Let's check Example 0's fourth input. Input [1,7,2,2]. Output is [2,2,7,1]. So moving both 2s to the front. So maybe collect all 2s and move them to the front, preserving their order, then append the remaining elements. Let's test this:\n\nOriginal input [1,7,2,2]. The 2s are at positions 2 and 3. Collecting them gives [2,2], then the remaining elements are [1,7]. So combined \u2192 [2,2,1,7]. But the output is [2,2,7,1]. So remaining elements are reversed? Yes, 1 and 7 become 7,1. So perhaps after collecting the 2s, the remaining elements are reversed. Let's check this for other examples.\n\nExample 0's first input: [6,6,6,2]. 2 is at the end. Collect 2 \u2192 [2], remaining elements [6,6,6]. Reverse \u2192 [6,6,6]. So combined \u2192 [2,6,6,6] which matches. Second input [6,1,6,2]. Collect 2 \u2192 [2], remaining [6,1,6]. Reverse \u2192 [6,1,6] reversed is [6,1,6] \u2192 no, reversed would be [6,1,6] \u2192 same as original. Wait, no. Wait [6,1,6] reversed is [6,1,6] \u2192 same as original. So output is [2,6,1,6], which is exactly that. Third input [7,2,7,2]. Collect 2s (positions 1 and 3) \u2192 [2,2], remaining elements [7,7]. Reverse \u2192 [7,7]. So combined \u2192 [2,2,7,7], but the output is [2,7,2,7]. So this doesn't fit. So that theory is invalid.\n\nWait maybe instead of reversing the remaining elements, we keep their original order. So for the third input [7,2,7,2], collect 2s (positions 1 and 3) \u2192 [2,2], remaining elements [7,7]. So combined \u2192 [2,2,7,7]. But output is [2,7,2,7]. So this doesn't match. So that's not the pattern.\n\nAlternative idea: perhaps the numbers after each 2 are moved to the front. Let's look at the fourth example again. Input [1,7,2,2]. The first 2 is at index 2. So elements after it (positions 3) are 2. Then the elements before are [1,7]. So if we take the elements after the first 2 and move them to front, then add the elements before. So [2] (after first 2) + [1,7] \u2192 [2,1,7], but the original has two 2s. Hmm, this is getting complicated.\n\nLet me look at Example 1. The first input row is [7,7,7,6,6,6,2]. Output [2,6,6,6,7,7,7]. So the 2 is moved to front, then the rest are 6s followed by 7s. The original after the 2 is nothing. Wait original elements are 7,7,7,6,6,6,2. So the 2 is last. If we collect all elements except the 2, reverse them, and put the 2 first. The remaining elements are 7,7,7,6,6,6. Reversed \u2192 6,6,6,7,7,7. So combined with 2 gives [2,6,6,6,7,7,7], which matches the output. So perhaps the pattern is: collect all 2s, then reverse the remaining elements and append them.\n\nWait in Example 0's third input [7,2,7,2]. The 2s are at positions 1 and 3. So collect all 2s \u2192 [2,2]. Then the remaining elements are 7 and 7. Reverse \u2192 7,7. So combined \u2192 [2,2,7,7]. But the output is [2,7,2,7]. So that doesn't fit. Hmm.\n\nWait maybe the 2s are kept in their original positions, but the other elements are reversed. Let's see. For [7,2,7,2], remaining elements (non-2) are 7 and 7. Reversing them gives 7,7. Then, inserting them into the positions that are not occupied by 2s. The original 2s are at positions 1 and 3. The non-2 positions are 0 and 2. So inserting reversed elements: 7 at 0, 7 at 2. So the array would be [7,2,7,2]. But that's the original. So this approach doesn't help.\n\nAlternative approach: perhaps split the array into two parts based on the last occurrence of 2, then reverse the first part and append the second part.\n\nWait let's check Example 0's first input [6,6,6,2]. The last occurrence of 2 is at index 3. So the first part is [6,6,6], reverse it to [6,6,6], append the 2. But output is [2,6,6,6], which is the 2 followed by reversed first part. So that's different. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the last occurrence of 2 is moved to the front. For [6,6,6,2], moving the last 2 to front gives [2,6,6,6], which matches. For [6,1,6,2], moving the last 2 to front gives [2,6,1,6], which matches. For [7,2,7,2], moving the last 2 (index 3) to front gives [2,7,2,7], which matches. For the fourth input [1,7,2,2], the last 2 is at index 3. Moving it to front gives [2,1,7,2], but the output is [2,2,7,1]. So this doesn't fit. So this approach only works for some cases.\n\nAlternatively, maybe all 2s are moved to the front in their original order, and then the remaining elements are reversed. Let's test this.\n\nExample 0's fourth input [1,7,2,2]. Collect 2s \u2192 [2,2], remaining elements [1,7]. Reverse \u2192 [7,1]. Combined \u2192 [2,2,7,1], which matches the output. For the third input [7,2,7,2], 2s are [2,2], remaining [7,7] reversed \u2192 [7,7]. Combined \u2192 [2,2,7,7], but the output is [2,7,2,7]. So this doesn't fit. So why the discrepancy?\n\nWait perhaps instead of collecting all 2s first, then reversing the remaining elements, maybe we move the first 2 to the front and then reverse the remaining elements. Let's see:\n\nExample 0's third input [7,2,7,2]. If we move the first 2 (position 1) to front, the array becomes [2,7,7,2]. Then reverse the remaining elements (7,7,2) \u2192 [2,7,7]. So combined \u2192 [2,2,7,7]. Doesn't match output [2,7,2,7].\n\nAlternatively, maybe each row is reversed and then all 2s are moved to the front. Let's check Example 0's fourth input [1,7,2,2]. Reverse \u2192 [2,2,7,1]. Then move 2s to front. But they're already in front, so the output is [2,2,7,1], which matches. For the third input [7,2,7,2], reversed is [2,7,2,7]. Then move 2s to front: [2,2,7,7], which doesn't match output [2,7,2,7]. So no.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the entire array is reversed, then each 2 is moved to the front in the reversed array, preserving order. For example, in the third input [7,2,7,2], reversed is [2,7,2,7]. Moving 2s to front would do nothing. So the output is [2,7,2,7], which matches. For the fourth input [1,7,2,2], reversed is [2,2,7,1]. Moving 2s to front (already in front) gives the same, which matches. Let's test other examples.\n\nExample 0's first input [6,6,6,2] reversed is [2,6,6,6], which is the output. Second input [6,1,6,2] reversed is [2,6,1,6], which matches the output. So this seems to fit all examples in Example 0. Then what about Example 1 and 2?\n\nExample 1's first input [7,7,7,6,6,6,2] reversed is [2,6,6,6,7,7,7], which matches the output. Second input [6,7,1,1,7,7,1] reversed is [1,7,7,1,1,7,6], which matches the output. Third input [7,7,2,1,2,6,6] reversed is [6,6,2,1,2,7,7], which matches the output. The fourth row in Example1's input is [2,2,7,7,7,2,2]. Reversed is [2,2,7,7,7,2,2], which is the same as the input and matches the output. So this pattern holds here.\n\nChecking Example2's first input row [1,2,7,1,1,1]. Reversed is [1,1,1,7,2,1], which matches the output. Second input row [2,1,7,7,2,6] reversed \u2192 [6,2,7,7,1,2]. The output for this row is [6,2,7,7,1,2], which matches. Third input row [2,1,2,6,2,1] reversed \u2192 [1,2,6,2,1,2]. The output is [1,2,6,2,1,2], which matches. Fourth input row [1,2,1,7,6,2] reversed \u2192 [2,6,7,1,2,1]. Output is [2,6,7,1,2,1], which matches. Fifth input row [2,7,1,2,7,1] reversed \u2192 [1,7,2,1,7,2], which matches the output. Sixth row input [2,1,6,2,7,7] reversed \u2192 [7,7,2,6,1,2], which matches the output.\n\nSo the pattern seems to be: reverse the entire row.\n\nBut wait, in all examples, the output is the reversed input. Let's verify.\n\nYes, in all training examples, the output is the reversed input array. Let me check:\n\nExample0's input row 0: [6,6,6,2] reversed \u2192 [2,6,6,6] \u2192 correct.\n\nRow 1: [6,1,6,2] \u2192 reversed [2,6,1,6] \u2192 correct.\n\nRow 2: [7,2,7,2] \u2192 reversed [2,7,2,7] \u2192 correct.\n\nRow3: [1,7,2,2] \u2192 reversed [2,2,7,1] \u2192 correct.\n\nExample1's input rows all reversed are the outputs.\n\nExample2's input rows reversed are the outputs.\n\nSo the pattern is simply reversing each row.\n\nSo the test input is three rows:\n\n[7,6,1]\n\n[6,7,6]\n\n[6,2,2]\n\nReversing each row:\n\nFirst row reversed \u2192 [1,6,7]\n\nSecond row reversed \u2192 [6,7,6]\n\nThird row reversed \u2192 [2,2,6]\n\nBut wait, the output examples in the training are in the same list format. So each input row is reversed to get the output row.\n\nSo the answer should be each test input row reversed.\n\nSo test input:\n\nRow1: [7,6,1] \u2192 [1,6,7]\n\nRow2: [6,7,6] \u2192 [6,7,6] (same as input, since it's a palindrome)\n\nRow3: [6,2,2] \u2192 [2,2,6]\n\nSo the output should be:\n\n[1,6,7]\n\n[6,7,6]\n\n[2,2,6]\n\nLooking back at the training examples' output format, the outputs are lists each in brackets, separated by lines. So the answer should be the three reversed lists."
