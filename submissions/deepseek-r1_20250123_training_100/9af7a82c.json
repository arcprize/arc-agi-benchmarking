        "cot_1": "Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. I need to figure out the pattern that transforms the given input matrices into the output ones. Let's look at the training examples first.\n\nStarting with Example 0:\nInput:\n[2, 2, 1]\n[2, 3, 1]\n[1, 1, 1]\n\nOutput:\n[1, 2, 3]\n[1, 2, 0]\n[1, 2, 0]\n[1, 0, 0]\n[1, 0, 0]\n\nHmm, the output has more rows than the input. The first output row is [1,2,3], which seems to be the unique values from the input matrix sorted. Let's check. The input has numbers 1,2,3. Sorted, they are 1,2,3. Then each subsequent row in the output has those numbers but trailing zeros. Also, the number of rows in the output is more than the input. Maybe it's related to the maximum frequency of elements?\n\nWait, looking at Example 1's input:\n[3,1,1,4]\n[2,2,2,4]\n[4,4,4,4]\n\nThe output starts with [4,2,1,3]. The unique values here are 1,2,3,4. But sorted in descending order of their frequency. Let's count frequencies. In Example 1:\n\n3 appears once in first row (but maybe across all rows?), 1 appears two times (first row has two 1s), 2 appears three times (second row has three 2s?), 4 appears in first row once, second once, third all four. Wait total counts: 3 (appears once in first row, once in second, and four in third? Wait maybe not. Maybe frequency per element across the entire input matrix.\n\nWait input matrix for Example 0:\n\nThe elements are 2,2,1; 2,3,1; 1,1,1. So all elements:\n\n2 appears 3 times (first row two, second row one), 3 once, 1 appears 5 times. Wait but the output starts with [1,2,3], which is sorted in ascending order. But 1 occurs most, then 2, then 3. So maybe sorted in descending order of frequency. Wait in Example 0, 1's count is 5, 2's is 3, 3's is 1. So descending order of frequency would be 1,2,3. Which matches the first row of the output.\n\nThen in Example 1's input:\n\n3 appears once (first row first element), 1 appears two times (first row two 1s), 2 appears three times (second row three 2s?), 4 appears 5 times (first row one 4, second row one 4, third row four 4s). So frequencies: 4 (5 times), 2 (3), 1 (2), 3 (1). So sorted descending order is 4,2,1,3. Which matches the first output row [4,2,1,3]. So the first row of the output is the unique elements sorted by their frequency in descending order, and if frequencies are the same, maybe sorted by value?\n\nWait in Example 2:\n\nInput:\n[8,8,2]\n[3,8,8]\n[3,3,4]\n[3,3,4]\n\nUnique elements are 8,2,3,4. Let's count frequencies. 8: first row two, second row two \u2192 total 4. 3: second row one, third row two, fourth row two? Wait third and fourth rows each have two 3s. So total 1 (from row 2) + 2 (row3) + 2 (row4) \u2192 5? Or maybe per cell. Let me recount:\n\nLooking at each element in all rows:\n\nRow 0: 8,8,2 \u2192 counts 8:2, 2:1\n\nRow1:3,8,8 \u2192 3:1, 8:2\n\nRow2:3,3,4 \u2192 3:2,4:1\n\nRow3:3,3,4 \u21923:2,4:1\n\nTotal counts:\n\n8: 2+2=4\n\n3: 1+2+2=5?\n\nWait 3 appears once in row1, two in row2, two in row3 \u2192 total 5.\n\n4: appears once in row2, once in row3 \u2192 2.\n\n2: appears once in row0.\n\nSo frequencies are 3 (5), 8 (4), 4 (2), 2 (1). So sorted descending order would be 3,8,4,2. Which matches the first output row [3,8,4,2].\n\nYes, so the first row of the output is the unique elements sorted by their frequency in descending order, and if frequencies are equal, perhaps sorted in ascending order of their numeric value. Wait in Example 2, 8 has frequency 4, 3 has 5. So 3 comes first. Then 8, then 4 (2) and 2 (1). So frequency is the main key.\n\nIn Example 3:\n\nInput:\n\n[1,1,1]\n[2,2,1]\n[2,8,1]\n[2,8,1]\n\nUnique elements are 1,2,8. Let's count frequencies:\n\n1 appears in row0 three times, row1 once, row2 once, row3 once \u2192 total 3+1+1+1 =6.\n\n2 appears row1 two, row2 one, row3 one \u2192 total 4.\n\n8 appears row2 one, row3 one \u2192 total 2.\n\nSo sorted by frequency: 1 (6), 2 (4), 8 (2). The first output row is [1,2,8], which matches.\n\nSo the first row of the output is the unique elements sorted in descending order of their frequency. If two elements have the same frequency, perhaps their order is determined by their numeric value (ascending or descending). Let's check for that.\n\nIn Example 1, after 4 (frequency 5), then 2 (3), 1 (2), 3 (1). So when frequencies are 3, 2, and 1. But let's see if there are examples where two elements have same frequency. Let's look at the test input:\n\nTest Input:\n[8,8,2,2]\n[1,8,8,2]\n[1,3,3,4]\n[1,1,1,1]\n\nUnique elements are 8,2,1,3,4.\n\nCount frequencies:\n\n8: first row two, second row two \u2192 4.\n\n2: first row two, second row one \u2192 3.\n\n1: second row one, third row one, fourth row four \u2192 1+1+4 =6.\n\n3: third row two \u2192 2.\n\n4: third row one \u21921.\n\nWait, wait:\n\nFirst row: 8,8,2,2 \u2192 counts 8:2, 2:2.\n\nSecond row:1,8,8,2 \u2192 counts 1:1, 8:2, 2:1.\n\nThird row:1,3,3,4 \u21921:1, 3:2, 4:1.\n\nFourth row:1,1,1,1 \u21921:4.\n\nSo total counts:\n\n1: 0 (from first row) +1 (second) +1 (third) +4 (fourth) \u2192 total 6.\n\n8: 2 (first) + 2 (second) \u21924.\n\n2: 2 (first) +1 (second) \u21923.\n\n3: 2 (third) \u21922.\n\n4:1 (third) \u21921.\n\nSo frequencies are:\n\n1 (6), 8 (4), 2 (3), 3 (2),4 (1).\n\nSo sorted by frequency descending: 1,8,2,3,4.\n\nSo the first output row should be [1,8,2,3,4]? But the test input's first output row, according to the examples, would be ordered by frequency. But the test input's output isn't given, so we need to generate it.\n\nBut wait the output rows in training examples have the first row as the sorted unique elements by frequency. Then each subsequent row seems to be a truncation of the first row with trailing elements replaced by zero, but how?\n\nLooking at Example 0's output:\n\n[1,2,3]\n\nThen next rows:\n\n[1,2,0]\n\n[1,2,0]\n\n[1,0,0]\n\n[1,0,0]\n\nSo the number of rows in the output is equal to the number of elements in the first output row. Example 0's first row has 3 elements, and output has 5 rows. Wait no: 3 elements in the first row, output has 5 rows. Hmm, maybe the number of rows depends on the maximum count of layers or something else.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the outputs, each row after the first has one more trailing zero than the previous. For example, in Example 0:\n\nRow 0: [1,2,3] (no zeros)\n\nRow 1: [1,2,0] (one zero)\n\nRow 2: [1,2,0] (same as row1)\n\nRow3: [1,0,0] (two zeros)\n\nRow4: [1,0,0] (same as row3)\n\nWait not sure. Let's think of each output row as representing a \"layer\". Maybe each layer corresponds to a certain frequency. For example, in Example 0, the elements are sorted as [1,2,3] with frequencies 5,3,1. The output rows have their non-zero elements as the elements that have a frequency greater than or equal to a certain number. Let's see:\n\nIn Example 0:\n\nRow 0: All elements (frequency >=1). So [1,2,3].\n\nRow1: Elements with frequency >=2? 1 (5), 2 (3). So [1,2,0].\n\nRow2: Same as row1. Hmm, perhaps row1 is for frequency >=2, then row2 for >=3?\n\nWait 1 has 5, 2 has 3. So at frequency >=3, 1 and 2. But row1 is [1,2,0], which is same as row2. Maybe that's not the pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each row after the first removes the last element and appends zero. But that doesn't explain why in Example 0, there are two rows with [1,2,0]. Alternatively, the number of rows in the output is equal to the maximum frequency minus some value. For Example 0, the maximum frequency is 5 (element 1). The output has 5 rows. So perhaps each row corresponds to a level of the frequency. For example:\n\nRow 0: all elements (level 1)\n\nRow1: elements that have frequency >=2.\n\nRow2: elements that have frequency >=3.\n\nRow3: elements that have frequency >=4.\n\nRow4: elements that have frequency >=5.\n\nBut let's check.\n\nExample 0's elements:\n\n1 (freq 5), 2 (3), 3 (1).\n\nRow0: all elements (>=1): yes.\n\nRow1: elements with freq >=2: 1,2. So [1,2,0].\n\nRow2: elements >=3: 1,2. So same as row1.\n\nRow3: elements >=4: 1. So [1,0,0].\n\nRow4: elements >=5: 1. So [1,0,0].\n\nThat matches the output. So the output rows are built by considering each level from 1 up to the maximum frequency. For each level k (from 1 to max_freq), we take the elements in the sorted list (by frequency) that have frequency >=k. Then pad with zeros to match the length of the first row.\n\nSo, for each k in 1 to max_frequency, create a row where each element is taken if its frequency is >=k, else 0. Then, each row after the first is constructed by this rule. Wait, but the first row would correspond to k=1. Then the next rows are k=2, k=3, etc.\n\nWait in Example 0, the max frequency is 5. So rows would be for k=1,2,3,4,5. Let's see:\n\nk=1: all elements (freq >=1) \u2192 [1,2,3]\n\nk=2: elements with freq >=2 \u21921,2 \u2192 [1,2,0]\n\nk=3: elements with freq >=3 \u21921,2 \u2192 [1,2,0]\n\nk=4: elements with freq >=4 \u21921 \u2192 [1,0,0]\n\nk=5: elements with freq >=5 \u21921 \u2192 [1,0,0]\n\nSo yes, that gives the 5 rows in Example 0.\n\nIn Example 1:\n\nInput's max frequency is 5 (element 4). So rows for k=1 to 5. Let's check:\n\nFirst output row is [4,2,1,3] (sorted by frequency descending:4 (5),2 (3),1 (2),3 (1)).\n\nk=1: all elements \u2192 [4,2,1,3]\n\nk=2: elements with freq >=2 \u21924,2,1 \u2192 [4,2,1,0]\n\nk=3: elements with freq >=3 \u21924,2 \u2192 [4,2,0,0]\n\nk=4: elements with freq >=4 \u21924 \u2192 [4,0,0,0]\n\nk=5: elements with freq >=5 \u21924 \u2192 [4,0,0,0]\n\nBut the output in Example 1 has 6 rows. Wait wait, Example 1's output is:\n\n[4,2,1,3]\n\n[4,2,1,0]\n\n[4,2,0,0]\n\n[4,0,0,0]\n\n[4,0,0,0]\n\n[4,0,0,0]\n\nSo that's 6 rows. But according to the previous logic, max frequency is 5 (element 4's frequency is 5), so there should be 5 rows (k=1 to 5). But in Example 1, the output has 6 rows. Hmm, so this suggests a discrepancy.\n\nWait let's re-examine Example 1's frequencies. Wait earlier analysis for Example 1:\n\nInput matrix:\n\nRow0:3,1,1,4 \u2192 elements 3 (1), 1 (2),4 (1)\n\nRow1:2,2,2,4 \u2192 elements 2 (3),4 (1)\n\nRow2:4,4,4,4 \u21924 (4)\n\nSo total frequencies:\n\n3:1 (from row0)\n\n1:2 (row0)\n\n2:3 (row1)\n\n4: 1 (row0) +1 (row1) +4 (row2) \u2192 total 6.\n\nSo wait, 4's total frequency is 6. So max frequency is 6. Then the rows would be from k=1 to 6.\n\nLet me recalculate:\n\nOriginal analysis for Example 1 had a mistake. Let's redo:\n\nInput Example1:\n\nEach row:\n\nRow0:3,1,1,4 \u2192 counts 3:1, 1:2,4:1.\n\nRow1:2,2,2,4 \u21922:3,4:1.\n\nRow2:4,4,4,4 \u21924:4.\n\nTotal counts:\n\n3:1\n\n1:2\n\n2:3\n\n4:1 (row0) +1 (row1) +4 (row2) =6.\n\nSo frequencies are:\n\n4:6, 2:3, 1:2, 3:1.\n\nSo sorted order is 4,2,1,3.\n\nThe first output row is [4,2,1,3], which matches.\n\nMax frequency is 6 (element4). So the number of rows is 6 (k=1 to 6).\n\nThen the output rows would be:\n\nk=1: [4,2,1,3]\n\nk=2: elements with freq >=2 \u21924,2,1 \u2192 [4,2,1,0]\n\nk=3: elements >=3 \u21924,2 \u2192 [4,2,0,0]\n\nk=4: elements >=4 \u21924 \u2192 [4,0,0,0]\n\nk=5: elements >=5 \u21924 \u2192 [4,0,0,0]\n\nk=6: elements >=6 \u21924 \u2192 [4,0,0,0]\n\nSo total 6 rows, which matches the example's output (6 rows). So the pattern is that for each k from 1 to the maximum frequency in the input matrix, create a row where each element is present if its frequency >=k, otherwise 0. The elements are ordered by their frequency in descending order (and for elements with the same frequency, perhaps their numeric value in ascending order? Let's check.)\n\nWait in the test input, if there are elements with the same frequency, how are they ordered?\n\nTake Example2:\n\nInput's unique elements sorted by frequency are 3 (5),8 (4),4 (2),2 (1).\n\nBut in the first output row it's [3,8,4,2]. So frequencies 5,4,2,1. So sorted by descending frequency.\n\nIf two elements have the same frequency, how are they ordered? Suppose in the input, two elements have same frequency. For example, imagine two elements with frequency 3. How would they be ordered in the first row?\n\nLooking at the training examples, there are no such cases. So we can assume that if frequencies are the same, they are sorted in ascending or descending order. Let's suppose ascending. For example, if two elements have frequency 3, then the smaller one comes first.\n\nBut since none of the examples have this, we'll have to assume that the order is descending frequency, then ascending value.\n\nNow, applying this to the test input.\n\nTest input:\n\n[8,8,2,2]\n[1,8,8,2]\n[1,3,3,4]\n[1,1,1,1]\n\nUnique elements: 8,2,1,3,4.\n\nCount their frequencies:\n\nRow0:8,8,2,2 \u21928:2, 2:2.\n\nRow1:1,8,8,2 \u21921:1,8:2,2:1.\n\nRow2:1,3,3,4 \u21921:1,3:2,4:1.\n\nRow3:1,1,1,1 \u21921:4.\n\nTotal:\n\n8: 2 (row0) +2 (row1) =4.\n\n2:2 (row0) +1 (row1) =3.\n\n1:1 (row1) +1 (row2) +4 (row3) =6.\n\n3:2 (row2).\n\n4:1 (row2) +0 others =1.\n\nSo frequencies:\n\n1:6, 8:4, 2:3, 3:2,4:1.\n\nSorted in descending order of frequency:\n\n1 (6),8 (4),2 (3),3 (2),4 (1). So the first row of the output would be [1,8,2,3,4].\n\nNow, the maximum frequency is 6 (for element1). So there will be 6 rows (k=1 to 6).\n\nEach row after that will check which elements have frequency >=k.\n\nLet's generate each row:\n\nk=1: all elements (since all have freq >=1). So [1,8,2,3,4]\n\nBut the input's first output row's length is 4 elements. Wait, no. The test input's output rows' lengths may depend on the number of unique elements. Wait in Example 0, input is 3x3 matrix, output first row is 3 elements. Example1's input is 3x4, output first row is 4 elements. Example2's input is 4x3, output first row is 4 elements (3,8,4,2). Wait, but the test input is 4 rows each of 4 elements. The first output row would have 5 elements (unique elements:1,8,2,3,4). But looking at the training examples, the output rows have the same number of elements as the first row, which is the count of unique elements. So for the test input, the first row would be [1,8,2,3,4], but all the examples have output rows with the same length as the first row. But in the given examples, like Example3's input has 4 rows (each with 3 elements?), and the output first row is [1,2,8], which is three elements. So the number of elements in the first output row equals the number of unique elements in the input matrix.\n\nBut in the test input, the unique elements are 1,8,2,3,4 (five unique elements). So the first row would be [1,8,2,3,4], and each subsequent row would have five elements. However, looking at the training examples, the output rows have the same length as the first row. For example, Example0's first output row has 3 elements, other rows have 3 elements.\n\nBut in the test input's test case, the first row would have 5 elements. But the input rows are of length 4. However, in Example2, input rows are of length 3, but output rows are of length4 (like [3,8,4,2]). Because the number of unique elements is four. So the output rows have as many elements as there are unique elements.\n\nThus, the test input's first output row would have 5 elements.\n\nBut looking at the test input's structure, the input is four rows each with four elements, but the unique elements are five:1,8,2,3,4.\n\nSo the first row of the output should be [1,8,2,3,4], then each subsequent row (k=2 to 6) would be:\n\nFor each k:\n\nk=1 \u2192 [1,8,2,3,4]\n\nk=2 \u2192 elements with freq >=2: 1 (6),8 (4),2 (3),3 (2). So [1,8,2,3,0] \u2192 but need to check order. Wait the elements are ordered by their frequency in descending order. At k=2, the frequencies are:\n\n1:6 \u22652 \u2192 yes.\n\n8:4 \u22652 \u2192 yes.\n\n2:3 \u22652 \u2192 yes.\n\n3:2 \u22652 \u2192 yes.\n\n4:1 <2 \u2192 no.\n\nSo elements are 1,8,2,3. So the row would be [1,8,2,3,0], but since the first row has 5 elements, this row would be [1,8,2,3,0].\n\nWait but how are the elements ordered when their frequencies are different for higher k?\n\nWait, the initial order is based on the overall frequency, sorted descending. So for each k, the elements that meet freq >=k are taken in the same order as the first row, but any element that doesn't meet the condition is replaced by 0.\n\nAh, that's the key. The order of elements in the output rows is fixed as the first row's order. Then, for each subsequent k, for each position in the first row's elements, if the element's frequency is >=k, it remains; else, it becomes 0.\n\nSo for example, in Example0's first row [1,2,3], the frequencies are 5,3,1. For k=2, the third element (3) has frequency 1 <2, so becomes 0. So the row is [1,2,0].\n\nSo applying this to the test input:\n\nFirst row: [1,8,2,3,4] (ordered by frequency descending:1,8,2,3,4).\n\nThen for each k from 1 to max_frequency (6):\n\nk=1: all elements have freq >=1 \u2192 [1,8,2,3,4]\n\nk=2: check each element:\n\n1's freq 6 >=2 \u2192 yes.\n\n8's 4 >=2 \u2192 yes.\n\n2's 3 >=2 \u2192 yes.\n\n3's 2 >=2 \u2192 yes.\n\n4's 1 <2 \u2192 no. \u2192 So row becomes [1,8,2,3,0]\n\nk=3:\n\n1 (6 \u22653 \u2192 yes), 8 (4\u22653 \u2192 yes), 2 (3\u22653 \u2192 yes), 3 (2 <3 \u2192 no), 4 (0). \u2192 [1,8,2,0,0]\n\nk=4:\n\n1 (6\u22654 \u2192 yes), 8 (4\u22654 \u2192 yes), 2 (3 <4 \u2192 no), 3 (no), 4 (no). \u2192 [1,8,0,0,0]\n\nk=5:\n\n1 (6\u22655 \u2192 yes), 8 (4 <5 \u2192 no), others no. \u2192 [1,0,0,0,0]\n\nk=6:\n\n1 (6\u22656 \u2192 yes), others no. \u2192 [1,0,0,0,0]\n\nk=7: but max frequency is 6, so stop at 6.\n\nSo the output rows would be:\n\n[1,8,2,3,4]\n\n[1,8,2,3,0]\n\n[1,8,2,0,0]\n\n[1,8,0,0,0]\n\n[1,0,0,0,0]\n\n[1,0,0,0,0]\n\nBut wait, the test input's input has four rows. The output examples in training have varying numbers of rows. For example, Example0 has 5 rows (max frequency 5), Example1 has 6 rows (max frequency 6). The test input's max frequency is 6 (element1), so there should be 6 rows.\n\nBut looking at the structure of the examples, each output row's length is the number of unique elements, which is 5 in the test case. However, the test input's output should have rows of 5 elements each, but the given training examples' outputs have varying lengths. For example, Example3's input has 4 rows, output has 6 rows (each with 3 elements).\n\nBut the problem says to respond in the format of the training examples. So the test input's output should have rows with 5 elements each, but in the training examples, each output row's length equals the number of unique elements. However, looking at the test input, the first row has 5 unique elements, so each output row would have 5 elements.\n\nBut looking back at the training examples:\n\nExample2's input has 4 rows (each with 3 elements), but the output's first row has 4 elements (3,8,4,2). So it's counting all unique elements regardless of row length. So for the test input, the first row of the output will have 5 elements. The rest of the rows will have the same number of elements, with trailing zeros.\n\nThus, the output rows for the test input should be:\n\nRow0: [1,8,2,3,4]\n\nRow1: [1,8,2,3,0]\n\nRow2: [1,8,2,0,0]\n\nRow3: [1,8,0,0,0]\n\nRow4: [1,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow5: [1,0,0,0,0]\n\nBut the test input's output should be formatted like the training examples. Let's check the training examples:\n\nExample0 has 3 elements in each output row. Example1 has 4 elements. Example2 has 4 elements. Example3 has 3 elements. So the number of elements in the output rows is equal to the number of unique elements in the input matrix.\n\nSo for the test input, the output rows will each have 5 elements. Now, let's write them out:\n\n[1,8,2,3,4]\n\n[1,8,2,3,0]\n\n[1,8,2,0,0]\n\n[1,8,0,0,0]\n\n[1,0,0,0,0]\n\n[1,0,0,0,0]\n\nThis would be 6 rows, matching the max frequency of 6. Now, comparing to the training examples, Example1's output has 6 rows (max frequency 6). So yes, this seems correct.",

        "cot_2": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. So, the task is to look at the training examples and find out how the input arrays are transformed into the output arrays. Then apply that pattern to the test input.\n\nLooking at the examples:\n\nStarting with Example 0:\n\nInput:\n[2, 2, 1]\n[2, 3, 1]\n[1, 1, 1]\n\nOutput:\n[1, 2, 3]\n[1, 2, 0]\n[1, 2, 0]\n[1, 0, 0]\n[1, 0, 0]\n\nHmm. The input has three rows. The output has five rows. Let's see how they're transformed. The first output row is [1,2,3], which might be the unique elements from the input, sorted or ordered in some way. Let's check the input elements. The elements across all input rows are 2,2,1; 2,3,1; 1,1,1. So all elements are 1,2,3. So the first output row is [1,2,3], which are the unique elements in the order of their first occurrence? Or sorted?\n\nWait, sorted in ascending order. 1,2,3. Then the next rows have zeros. Maybe each subsequent row is a \"level\" where the elements are filled from the previous ones, replacing some with zeros. Let's look at the output rows:\n\nRow 0: [1,2,3]\nRow 1: [1,2,0]\nRow 2: [1,2,0]\nRow 3: [1,0,0]\nRow 4: [1,0,0]\n\nNot sure yet. Let's check another example.\n\nExample 1:\n\nInput:\n[3,1,1,4]\n[2,2,2,4]\n[4,4,4,4]\n\nOutput:\n[4,2,1,3]\n[4,2,1,0]\n[4,2,0,0]\n[4,0,0,0]\n[4,0,0,0]\n[4,0,0,0]\n\nSo the first output row here is [4,2,1,3]. The unique elements in the input are 3,1,4,2. Wait, but the order here is 4,2,1,3. How does that come? Let's look at the input rows:\n\nFirst row is [3,1,1,4], so elements 3,1,4. Second row [2,2,2,4], adding 2. Third row is all 4. So the unique elements are 3,1,4,2. But the output starts with 4, then 2, 1, 3. Maybe the order is determined by the frequency of the elements across the input. Let's count frequencies in Example 1:\n\nIn input:\n\n3 appears once (first row first element)\n1 appears three times (first row two 1s, second row none, third none)\nWait, first row: 3,1,1,4 \u2192 3:1, 1:2, 4:1.\nSecond row: 2,2,2,4 \u2192 2:3, 4:1.\nThird row: all 4s \u2192 4:4.\n\nSo total counts across all input arrays:\n\n3: 1\n1: 2 (from first row) + 0 + 0 = 2?\nWait no, in the first row, 3 occurs once, 1 occurs twice, 4 once. Second row, 2 occurs three times, 4 once. Third row 4 occurs four times.\n\nSo total counts:\n\n3:1\n1:2\n2:3\n4:1+1+4=6.\n\nSo frequencies are 3:1, 1:2, 2:3, 4:6. Ordered from highest to lowest: 4 (6), 2 (3), 1 (2), 3 (1). That's exactly the order in the first output row [4,2,1,3]. So the first output row lists the unique elements sorted by their total frequency in descending order.\n\nSo the pattern for the first row is to list the unique elements from all input arrays, ordered by their total frequency (descending). If two elements have the same frequency, perhaps order is by their first occurrence or numerical value? Let's check other examples.\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput:\n[8,8,2]\n[3,8,8]\n[3,3,4]\n[3,3,4]\n\nOutput:\n[3,8,4,2]\n[3,8,4,0]\n[3,8,0,0]\n[3,8,0,0]\n[3,0,0,0]\n\nFirst output row is [3,8,4,2]. Let's compute frequencies:\n\nInput rows:\n\nRow 0: 8 (2), 2 (1)\nRow 1: 3 (1), 8 (2)\nRow 2:3 (2),4 (1)\nRow3:3 (2),4 (1)\n\nTotal counts:\n\n8: 2 +2=4\n3: 1 +2 +2=5\n4:1 +1=2\n2:1.\n\nSo frequencies: 3 (5),8 (4),4 (2),2 (1). So sorted descending:3,8,4,2. Which matches the first output row. So the first row is indeed ordered by total frequency.\n\nThen, the next rows in the output have zeros replacing elements. Let's see how that works. For example, in Example 0, after the first row, the next rows have zeros. How many rows are there in the output? For Example 0, input is 3 rows of 3 elements each. Output has 5 rows. Let's see:\n\nExample0's output has 5 rows. Let's see how many rows are generated. Maybe the number of output rows is equal to the maximum count of any element. Wait, in Example0, frequencies are:\n\n1: how many times does 1 appear?\n\nIn input rows:\n\nRow0: 2,2,1 \u2192 1 once.\n\nRow1:2,3,1 \u21921 once.\n\nRow2: all 1s \u2192 three times.\n\nTotal 1s: 1+1+3=5.\n\n2s: row0: two, row1: one, row2: zero \u2192 3.\n\n3s: row1: one, others zero \u21921.\n\nSo frequencies: 1:5, 2:3,3:1. So the first output row is [1,2,3], which is ordered by frequency (5,3,1). Then, the next rows seem to be dropping elements from the end, replacing with zeros. Like in example0's output:\n\nRow1: [1,2,0]\n\nRow2: same as row1.\n\nRow3: [1,0,0]\n\nRow4: same as row3.\n\nSo the number of output rows might be equal to the maximum frequency. For example0, maximum frequency is 5 (element 1). But the output has 5 rows. Let's check example1:\n\nIn example1, maximum frequency is 6 (element 4). Output has 6 rows. Yes. Example1's output has 6 rows. Example2's input has frequencies:3 (5),8(4),4(2),2(1). Max frequency is 5. Output has 5 rows. Wait example2's output has 5 rows. So the number of output rows is equal to the maximum frequency of any element. Let's check:\n\nExample3:\n\nInput has [1,1,1], [2,2,1], [2,8,1], [2,8,1]. Let's compute frequencies.\n\n1: row0:3, row1:1, row2:1, row3:1 \u2192 total 6.\n\n2: row1:2, row2:1, row3:1 \u2192 total 4.\n\n8: row2:1, row3:1 \u2192 total 2.\n\nSo frequencies 1:6, 2:4, 8:2. Max frequency is 6. The output has 6 rows. Let's check example3's output:\n\nYes, it has 6 rows. So the output rows are equal to the maximum frequency of any element in the input. Each row represents a \"level\", perhaps where elements with frequency >= current level remain, others are replaced by zero. But how?\n\nWait in example0, the first row is [1,2,3]. Then the next rows have elements replaced by zero from the end. For example, row1 is [1,2,0], then row2 same as row1, row3 [1,0,0], etc.\n\nWait let's see. For example0's output:\n\nRow0: [1,2,3] (all elements present)\nRow1: [1,2,0]\nRow2: same as row1.\nRow3: [1,0,0]\nRow4: same as row3.\n\nSo, the output rows are generated by taking the elements in the order of their frequency (descending), and in each subsequent row, starting from the second, the last non-zero element is replaced by zero, but perhaps in a way that each element's position is determined by how many times it can \"stay\" based on its frequency.\n\nWait, maybe each row corresponds to the current level (from 1 to max frequency). For each element, if its frequency is >= the level, it stays; otherwise, it's zero.\n\nWait, let's take example0:\n\nElements are 1 (freq5), 2 (3), 3 (1).\n\nFor level 1: all elements have freq >=1 \u2192 all present.\n\nBut that's not the case. The first row is [1,2,3], which is level 1? Then level 2:\n\nelement1's freq is 5 >=2 \u2192 yes.\n\nelement2's freq3 >=2 \u2192 yes.\n\nelement3's freq1 <2 \u2192 no. So replace with zero. So row1 would be [1,2,0]. Then level3:\n\nelement1 >=3 \u2192 yes.\n\nelement2 >=3 \u2192 yes (3 is equal to 3). So row2 would be [1,2,0] again.\n\nWait but level3 would be:\n\nelement3's freq is 1 <3 \u2192 zero.\n\nelement2's freq is3 >=3 \u2192 stays. So row1 and row2 are same. Then level4:\n\nelement1's freq5 >=4 \u2192 yes.\n\nelement2's freq3 <4 \u2192 replaced by zero. So row3 would be [1,0,0]. Then level5:\n\nelement1's freq5 >=5 \u2192 yes. So row4 is [1,0,0].\n\nBut wait, for example0, the output rows after the first are:\n\nRow1: [1,2,0]\n\nRow2: [1,2,0]\n\nRow3: [1,0,0]\n\nRow4: [1,0,0]\n\nBut according to the level idea, the rows should be for levels 2,3,4,5:\n\nLevel2: [1,2,0]\n\nLevel3: [1,2,0]\n\nLevel4: [1,0,0]\n\nLevel5: [1,0,0]\n\nWait, but example0's output has 5 rows, which matches the max frequency of 5. So row0 is the first level (level1?), row1 level2, row2 level3, row3 level4, row4 level5. But according to that:\n\nAt level2:\n\nelements with frequency >=2: 1 (5), 2 (3) \u2192 keep, 3 (1) is 0.\n\nSo row1: [1,2,0]\n\nAt level3: elements >=3: 1, 2. So same as row1: [1,2,0].\n\nAt level4: elements >=4: 1 (5). So row3: [1,0,0].\n\nAt level5: only 1, so row4: same as row3.\n\nSo the rows are generated by for each level from 1 to max_freq, in each level, for each element in the order of the first row (sorted by frequency), check if their frequency is >= the current level. If yes, keep the element, else zero.\n\nWait, but in example0, the first row is level1. For level2, check each element's frequency >=2.\n\nSo the output rows are constructed for each level, starting at 1 up to max frequency, but perhaps each level corresponds to the row index. So the first row (row0) is the elements ordered by frequency. Then each subsequent row is for the next level, checking if the element's frequency is >= the row's level (row index +1).\n\nWait example0 has 5 output rows. Let's index them from 0 to4. So:\n\nRow0 (level1): all elements have frequency >=1 \u2192 all present.\n\nRow1 (level2): check if each element's frequency >=2. 1:5 >=2 yes; 2:3 >=2 yes; 3:1 >=2 no \u2192 0.\n\nSo row1 is [1,2,0].\n\nRow2 (level3): 1 >=3 yes, 2 >=3 yes (3 >=3), 3 >=3 no \u2192 same as row1: [1,2,0].\n\nRow3 (level4): 1 >=4 yes, 2 >=4 (3 >=4? No) \u2192 0. So row3: [1,0,0].\n\nRow4 (level5): 1 >=5 yes, others no. So same as row3.\n\nThis seems to fit. So the process is:\n\n1. Collect all elements from the input arrays.\n\n2. Count the frequency of each element.\n\n3. Order elements in descending order of frequency. If frequencies are equal, maybe order by their value or first occurrence? Let's check example3.\n\nExample3's output first row is [1,2,8]. The input elements are 1,2,8. Frequencies:\n\n1: row0:3, row1:1, row2:1, row3:1 \u2192 total 6.\n\n2: row1:2, row2:1, row3:1 \u2192 total4.\n\n8: row2:1, row3:1 \u2192 total2.\n\nSo order is 1 (6), 2 (4), 8 (2). So the first row is [1,2,8]. Which matches.\n\nSo in case of same frequencies, perhaps the elements are ordered by their value in descending order? But in example0, the elements are 1,2,3 ordered by frequencies 5,3,1, which is correct.\n\nBut when frequencies are the same, maybe order is by element value in descending order. Let's check example2:\n\nIn example2, the first row is [3,8,4,2]. Frequencies are 3 (5),8 (4),4 (2),2 (1). So ordered by descending frequencies. So correct.\n\nAnother example: suppose two elements with same frequency. Let's imagine input where two elements have same frequency. How are they ordered? The examples given don't have this case. But the problem statement says to follow the pattern in the training examples. Since none of the training examples have elements with equal frequency, perhaps the tiebreaker is not needed here. But for the test input, perhaps we need to consider that.\n\nNow, the output rows are generated as follows:\n\n- The first row is the list of unique elements ordered by their frequencies in descending order.\n\n- For each subsequent row (from level 2 up to max frequency), each element in the first row is checked: if its frequency is >= current level, it stays; else, it becomes 0.\n\nThe number of output rows is equal to the maximum frequency of any element.\n\nSo applying this to the test input:\n\nTest Input:\n\n[8, 8, 2, 2]\n\n[1, 8, 8, 2]\n\n[1, 3, 3, 4]\n\n[1, 1, 1, 1]\n\nFirst, collect all elements from all input rows and count their frequencies.\n\nElements in each row:\n\nRow0: 8,8,2,2 \u2192 counts: 8:2, 2:2.\n\nRow1:1,8,8,2 \u2192 1:1, 8:2, 2:1.\n\nRow2:1,3,3,4 \u2192 1:1,3:2,4:1.\n\nRow3:1,1,1,1 \u21921:4.\n\nTotal counts:\n\n1: 1 (row0?) No. Let's recount:\n\nRow0: elements 8,8,2,2 \u2192 no 1s.\n\nRow1: 1 occurs once.\n\nRow2: 1 once.\n\nRow3: 1 four times.\n\nTotal 1: 1+1+4=6.\n\n8: row0:2, row1:2 \u2192 total 4.\n\n2: row0:2, row1:1 \u2192 total3.\n\n3: row2:2.\n\n4: row2:1.\n\nSo frequencies:\n\n1:6, 8:4, 2:3,3:2,4:1.\n\nSo the unique elements ordered by frequency descending are 1,8,2,3,4.\n\nSo first row of output is [1,8,2,3,4]?\n\nWait no. Wait the test input has four rows. Let's list all elements:\n\nLooking at each element:\n\nRow0: 8,8,2,2 \u2192 elements 8 and 2.\n\nRow1:1,8,8,2 \u2192 elements 1,8,2.\n\nRow2:1,3,3,4 \u21921,3,4.\n\nRow3:1,1,1,1 \u21921.\n\nSo unique elements are 1,8,2,3,4.\n\nFrequencies:\n\n1: row1 (1) + row2 (1) + row3 (4) \u2192 total 6.\n\n8: row0 (2) + row1 (2) \u21924.\n\n2: row0 (2) + row1 (1) \u21923.\n\n3: row2 (2) \u21922.\n\n4: row2 (1) \u21921.\n\nSo ordered by frequency:\n\n1 (6), 8 (4),2 (3),3 (2),4 (1).\n\nSo the first output row should be [1,8,2,3,4]. But the output needs to be structured into rows. Wait the test input's first row is of length4, but the output rows will have elements as per the unique elements. Wait the training examples' output rows have lengths matching the number of unique elements. For example, Example0 input has three elements (1,2,3), so output rows have 3 elements. Test input's unique elements are 5:1,8,2,3,4. So each output row will have 5 elements.\n\nThen, the number of output rows is equal to the maximum frequency, which is 6 (element1 has frequency6). So there should be 6 rows.\n\nNow, for each row from level1 to level6:\n\nRow0 (level1): all elements have frequency >=1 \u2192 [1,8,2,3,4].\n\nRow1 (level2): check each element's frequency >=2.\n\n1 (6) yes,8 (4) yes,2 (3) yes,3 (2) yes,4 (1) no \u2192 replace 4 with 0 \u2192 [1,8,2,3,0].\n\nRow2 (level3): 1 >=3 (yes),8 >=3 (4 >=3 yes),2 >=3 (3 >=3 yes),3 >=3 (2 <3 no \u21920),4 no \u2192 [1,8,2,0,0].\n\nRow3 (level4): check >=4.\n\n1 (6 >=4 yes),8 (4 >=4 yes),2 (3 <4 \u21920), others no \u2192 [1,8,0,0,0].\n\nRow4 (level5): >=5.\n\n1 (6 >=5 yes),8 (4 <5 \u21920), others no \u2192 [1,0,0,0,0].\n\nRow5 (level6): >=6.\n\nOnly 1 (6 >=6 \u2192 yes). So [1,0,0,0,0].\n\nSo the output rows would be:\n\n[1,8,2,3,4]\n\n[1,8,2,3,0]\n\n[1,8,2,0,0]\n\n[1,8,0,0,0]\n\n[1,0,0,0,0]\n\n[1,0,0,0,0]\n\nWait but the test input's output should be structured according to the training examples. Let's check the training examples again. For example, in example1, the first row is [4,2,1,3]. Then the next rows drop elements starting from the end. So perhaps each subsequent row replaces the last non-zero elements with zeros, but based on the level.\n\nWait the way the elements are replaced is that, for each level, the elements in the first row are kept if their frequency is >= level, else zero. The order of elements in the first row is sorted by frequency descending, so the first element has highest frequency, then next, etc. So each level removes elements from the end first. Because the elements with lower frequencies (appearing later in the list) will have their frequency < level earlier than elements with higher frequencies.\n\nFor example, in the test case:\n\nRow0 (level1): all elements are present.\n\nRow1 (level2): 4 (frequency1) is replaced. So [1,8,2,3,0].\n\nRow2 (level3): 3 (frequency2) is now <3 \u2192 replaced. So [1,8,2,0,0].\n\nRow3 (level4): 2's frequency is3 <4 \u2192 replaced. So [1,8,0,0,0].\n\nRow4 (level5):8's frequency4 <5 \u2192 replaced. So [1,0,0,0,0].\n\nRow5 (level6): only 1 remains.\n\nSo the output rows are:\n\n[1,8,2,3,4]\n\n[1,8,2,3,0]\n\n[1,8,2,0,0]\n\n[1,8,0,0,0]\n\n[1,0,0,0,0]\n\n[1,0,0,0,0]\n\nBut looking at the training examples, for example example3's output:\n\nOutput is:\n\n[1,2,8]\n\n[1,2,8]\n\n[1,2,0]\n\n[1,2,0]\n\n[1,0,0]\n\n[1,0,0]\n\nWhich makes sense. The first two rows are level1 and level2. Since 8's frequency is2, which is >=1 and >=2. So it's replaced starting at level3. So for level3, 8's frequency is2 <3 \u21920.\n\nSo the pattern is that each row corresponds to the level, and elements are kept if their frequency >= current level. The first row is level1, next level2, etc.\n\nSo for the test input, the output would be six rows, each with 5 elements. The first row has all elements, the next replaces the last element (4), then next replaces 3 and 4, then replaces 2,3,4, etc.\n\nSo the output should be:\n\nRow0: [1,8,2,3,4]\n\nRow1: [1,8,2,3,0]\n\nRow2: [1,8,2,0,0]\n\nRow3: [1,8,0,0,0]\n\nRow4: [1,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow5: [1,0,0,0,0]\n\nBut let's check if the way the elements are ordered is correct. In the test input's unique elements ordered by frequency:\n\n1 (6), 8 (4), 2 (3),3 (2),4 (1).\n\nSo yes, the first row is [1,8,2,3,4]. Then each level is applied.\n\nSo the final output for the test input would have six rows. Each row is as follows:\n\n[1,8,2,3,4]\n\n[1,8,2,3,0]\n\n[1,8,2,0,0]\n\n[1,8,0,0,0]\n\n[1,0,0,0,0]\n\n[1,0,0,0,0]\n\nBut looking at the training examples, for example example3, the output rows after the first two have zeros introduced. The pattern in the test input's output should follow this.\n\nNow, formatting the answer in the same way as the training examples. The output is a list of lists, each inner list being the output rows. The rows are ordered from first to last.\n\nSo for the test input, the output should be:\n\n[1,8,2,3,4]\n\n[1,8,2,3,0]\n\n[1,8,2,0,0]\n\n[1,8,0,0,0]\n\n[1,0,0,0,0]\n\n[1,0,0,0,0]\n\nBut let's check the training examples for the way they are formatted. For example, example0's output has 5 rows, example1 6 rows, etc. Each row is enclosed in [] and separated by lines.\n\nSo the response should be:\n\n[1,8,2,3,4]\n\n[1,8,2,3,0]\n\n[1,8,2,0,0]\n\n[1,8,0,0,0]\n\n[1,0,0,0,0]\n\n[1,0,0,0,0]\n\nBut wait, the test input's first row is [8,8,2,2], second [1,8,8,2], third [1,3,3,4], fourth [1,1,1,1]. The unique elements are 1,8,2,3,4. Their frequencies are 6,4,3,2,1.\n\nSo the order is correct."
