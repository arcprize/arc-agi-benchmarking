        "cot_1": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. So, the input is a 3x3 grid of numbers, and the output is another 3x3 grid where all the numbers are the same. The examples show that each output grid is filled with a single number repeated. My task is to find out what determines that number.\n\nLooking at Example 0:\nInput:\n[4, 4, 8]\n[6, 4, 3]\n[6, 3, 0]\nOutput is all 4s. Let's see. The input has numbers 4, 8, 6, 3, 0. Maybe the output is the minimum number in the input? Let's check. The min here is 0, but the output is 4. Hmm, not that. Or maybe the maximum? The max is 8, but output is 4. So that's not it.\n\nWait, maybe the number that appears most frequently? Let's count. In Example 0, 4 appears 4 times (first row two 4s, second row another 4, and others are 8,6,3, etc.) Then 6 appears twice, 3 appears once, etc. So 4 is the mode. Output is 4. That fits. Let's check the next example.\n\nExample 1:\nInput:\n[6,8,9]\n[1,8,1]\n[9,4,9]\nThe numbers here are 6,8,9,1,8,1,9,4,9. So 9 appears 4 times, 8 appears twice, 1 twice, 6 once, 4 once. The mode is 9, and the output is all 9s. That works.\n\nExample 2:\nInput:\n[4,6,9]\n[6,4,1]\n[8,8,6]\nNumbers: 4,6,9,6,4,1,8,8,6. Let's count. 6 appears 4 times (positions (0,1), (1,0), (2,2), and (2,0) maybe? Wait wait, the input rows are [4,6,9], [6,4,1], [8,8,6]. So first row: 4,6,9. Second:6,4,1. Third:8,8,6. So 6 appears in first row once, second once, third once. Wait total of three times. Let me count again. First row: 6 once. Second row: 6 once. Third row: 6 once. So total 3 times. Then 8 appears twice in third row. 4 appears twice (first row once, second row once). So the mode here would be 6 (appears three times). The output is all 6s. So yes, that matches. So the pattern seems to be that the output grid is filled with the mode of all the numbers in the input grid. The mode is the number that appears most frequently. If there's a tie, maybe pick the highest one? Let me check the examples again to see if any have a tie.\n\nWait, in example 0, the input has 4 four times. The rest are fewer. So no tie. In example 1, 9 is the mode. No tie. Example 2, 6 is the mode. So all examples use the mode. So for the test input, we need to find the mode of all the numbers in the input grid and fill the output grid with that number.\n\nTest Input:\n[8,8,6]\n[4,6,9]\n[8,3,0]\nLet's list all numbers: 8,8,6,4,6,9,8,3,0. So count each:\n\n8: appears in first row twice (positions 0 and 1), and third row first element. So total of 3 times. Let's count all:\n\nFirst row: 8,8,6 \u2192 8 (2), 6 (1)\nSecond row:4,6,9 \u2192 4,6,9 each once\nThird row:8,3,0 \u2192 8 once, 3 once, 0 once.\nTotal counts:\n8: 2 +1 (third row) \u2192 total 3?\nWait, first row has two 8s, third row has one 8. So 3 in total. 6 appears in first row once, second row once. So 6: 2 times. Others: 4 once, 9 once, 3 once, 0 once. So mode is 8. Therefore, the output grid should be all 8s.\n\nSo the output would be three rows each [8,8,8].",

        "cot_2": "Okay, let's look at these examples to figure out the pattern. So, in each example, the input is a 3x3 grid of numbers, and the output is another 3x3 grid where all the elements are the same. The question is, how do we get from the input to the output?\n\nLet me start by examining the first example. The input is:\n\n[4, 4, 8]\n[6, 4, 3]\n[6, 3, 0]\n\nAnd the output is all 4s. Hmm. Let's check the numbers. The input numbers here are 4, 4, 8, 6, 4, 3, 6, 3, 0. What's special about 4 here? Maybe it's the most frequent number. Let's count: 4 appears four times, 6 appears twice, 3 appears twice, 8 once, 0 once. So yes, 4 is the mode. But the output is all 4s. So maybe the output is a grid filled with the mode of the input numbers.\n\nChecking the second example. Input:\n\n[6,8,9]\n[1,8,1]\n[9,4,9]\n\nThe numbers here are 6,8,9,1,8,1,9,4,9. The mode is 9 (appearing three times). Output is all 9s. That fits.\n\nThird example input:\n\n[4,6,9]\n[6,4,1]\n[8,8,6]\n\nNumbers: 4 (twice), 6 (three times), 9, 1, 8 (twice). So mode is 6, and output is all 6s. That matches.\n\nSo the pattern seems to be: take the mode (most frequent number) of all the numbers in the input grid and fill the entire output grid with that number. If there's a tie, maybe pick the largest one? Wait, let's check if there's a tie in any example. \n\nIn the first example, the numbers 6 and 3 both appeared twice, but the mode was 4. So no tie. Second example, 9 was the mode. Third example, 6 was the mode. So perhaps in case of a tie, maybe the highest number among the modes? Let's see. Suppose if there's a tie, say two numbers with same highest frequency, which one is chosen?\n\nBut in the training examples, there's no such case, so maybe the answer is just the mode. Let's test the test input.\n\nTest input:\n\n[8,8,6]\n[4,6,9]\n[8,3,0]\n\nAll numbers: 8 appears 3 times, 6 appears 2, 4 once, 9 once, 3 once, 0 once. So the mode is 8. Therefore, the output grid should be filled with 8s. So the output would be three rows of [8,8,8]."
