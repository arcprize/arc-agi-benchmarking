        "cot_1": "Okay, let's see. I need to figure out the pattern from the training examples and then apply it to the test input. Let's start by looking at the examples carefully.\n\nStarting with Example 0. The input is a 3x3 matrix. The output is a 6x6 matrix. Hmm, so each dimension is doubled. Let me check:\n\nOriginal input rows are [2,0,0], [0,0,0], [0,0,2]. The output has 6 rows, each with 6 elements. So each row in the input is transformed into two rows in the output, and each element is transformed into two elements. But how?\n\nLooking at the output rows for Example 0:\n\nFirst input row [2,0,0] becomes two rows in the output. The first output row is [2,0,8,2,0,8], and the third is [8,0,2,8,0,2]. Wait, maybe each original element is being replaced by a 2x2 block. Let's see:\n\nOriginal element 2 might become a 2x2 block of [2,8;8,2] or something like that. Let's check. For the first row input [2,0,0], the first output row starts with 2,0,8. Wait, maybe each element is expanded into two elements, and the 0s are maybe turned into 8s when adjacent to a non-zero?\n\nWait, in the first example's output, the 2s are at the corners of the expanded matrix. Like, the input 2 at (0,0) and (2,2). The output for those positions is 2 in the top-left and bottom-right of their 2x2 blocks. So maybe when a number is present, it's placed in the top-left and bottom-right of the 2x2 block, and the other two positions are 8s. For example, an input 2 becomes [2,8;8,2] in the output. Let's test this.\n\nIn Example 0, the input has 2 at [0][0] and [2][2]. The output's first row starts with 2,0,8... Wait, maybe the 0s are handled differently. Wait, in the input of Example 0, the first row is [2,0,0]. So each element is 2,0,0. Let's see how they expand. The first output row is [2,0,8,2,0,8]. Wait, this seems like each element is being turned into two elements. The 2 becomes [2,8], the 0 becomes [0,8], and then the next 0 becomes [2,8] again? Not sure. Alternatively, maybe each row is duplicated, and each element is paired with 8 in some way.\n\nAlternatively, looking at Example 2. The input is a 2x2 matrix:\n\n[0,4]\n[0,0]\n\nThe output is 4x4. The output rows are:\n\n[0,4,0,4]\n[0,8,0,8]\n[0,4,0,4]\n[0,8,0,8]\n\nSo each row in the input becomes two rows. The first input row [0,4] becomes [0,4,0,4] and [0,8,0,8]. So the 0 is expanded to [0,0] in the first row and [0,8] in the second? And the 4 becomes [4,4] in the first and [8,8] in the second? Wait, no. Because the input row is [0,4], which becomes in the first output row [0,4,0,4], which seems like each element is duplicated. Then the next row is [0,8,0,8]. So perhaps each input element is duplicated, but in the next row, 0 becomes 0 and 8, and 4 becomes 8 and 8? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each element is transformed into a 2x2 block where the original value is placed in the top-left and bottom-right, and 8 in the other positions. For example, 0 would become [0,8;8,0], but in Example 2, the 0 in the input becomes [0,0;0,8] perhaps? Wait, looking at the output for Example 2:\n\nFirst input row is [0,4]. The first output row is [0,4,0,4], which could be 0 expanded to [0,0], and 4 expanded to [4,4]. Then the next output row is [0,8,0,8], so perhaps the 0 becomes [0,8] and the 4 becomes [8,8]. But then why? Maybe it's that each element is duplicated horizontally, and then each row is duplicated vertically with 8s replacing the original non-zero elements in the second row of each pair.\n\nWait, in Example 2, the input [0,4] becomes two rows: [0,4,0,4] and [0,8,0,8]. So each element is duplicated, and then in the next row, the non-zero (4) becomes 8s. So maybe the transformation is:\n\nEach element in the input is duplicated horizontally (so 0 becomes 0,0; 4 becomes 4,4). Then each row is duplicated vertically. If the original row has a non-zero element, then in the duplicated row, those elements become 8s. Wait, but in the first output row of Example 2, the 4 becomes [4,4], and in the second row, it's [8,8]. So maybe, for each element in the input, when you duplicate the row, the first copy is the element duplicated, and the second copy is 8 if the element was non-zero, otherwise 0. Wait, but the second row for the 0 elements in the input is 0,8. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's a tiling pattern. For example, each element is expanded into a 2x2 block. The 0s become a certain pattern, non-zero numbers become another.\n\nLooking at Example 0's input:\n\nOriginal 2 in positions (0,0) and (2,2). Their corresponding blocks in the output would be:\n\nFor (0,0), the first two rows and first two columns:\n\nFirst output row starts with 2, 0. Then 8, 2... Wait, maybe not. Let me look at the output again:\n\nExample 0's output is:\n\nRow 0: [2,0,8,2,0,8]\nRow 1: [8,0,8,8,0,8]\nRow 2: [8,0,2,8,0,2]\nRow 3: [2,0,8,2,0,8]\nRow 4: [8,0,8,8,0,8]\nRow 5: [8,0,2,8,0,2]\n\nSo, the input is 3x3, output 6x6. So each element becomes a 2x2 block. Let's see how 2 is transformed. The first element in the input is 2 at (0,0). The corresponding 2x2 block in the output would be the top-left 2x2:\n\n[2,0]\n[8,0] ?\n\nWait, looking at the first two rows of the output:\n\nRow0: 2,0,8,2,0,8\n\nRow1:8,0,8,8,0,8\n\nHmm, perhaps each input element is split into a 2x2 block. Let's take the input 2. The 2's block might be:\n\n[2,8]\n[8,2]\n\nBut in the output, the first 2 in the input (0,0) would be at position (0,0) in the output. Then the next element in the input row (0,1) is 0. Its block might be [0,0;0,0], but in the output, the second and third elements in row0 are 0 and 8. So maybe 0's block is [0,8;8,0], but not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each input element is replaced by two elements in the row direction and two rows. So each element is duplicated and mirrored in some way with 8s. Let's see for Example 0:\n\nInput row [2,0,0] becomes row0 and row1 in the output as:\n\nRow0: 2,0,8, 2,0,8\n\nRow1:8,0,8,8,0,8\n\nWait, each element is expanded to two elements. For 2: 2 followed by 8. Then 0 becomes 0 and 8. Then another 0 becomes 2 and 8 again? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each input row is mirrored and combined with some transformation. For instance, the first input row [2,0,0] becomes [2,0,8] followed by [2,0,8], but then the output rows are longer. Wait, the output rows for Example 0 have six elements. The input row had three elements. So each element is transformed into two elements. For example, 2 becomes 2 and 8, 0 becomes 0 and 8? Let's check.\n\nOriginal row [2,0,0]. If each element is split into two elements: 2 becomes [2,8], 0 becomes [0,8], 0 becomes [0,8]. So the row would be [2,8, 0,8, 0,8]. But in the actual output row0, it's [2,0,8,2,0,8]. Hmm, that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the input row is duplicated with some changes. Like, the first row [2,0,0] becomes two rows. The first output row is [2,0,8, 2,0,8], which seems like [2,0,0] with each element followed by 8, but interleaved with something. Wait, maybe each element in the input row is turned into a pair of elements. Like, 2 becomes [2,8], 0 becomes [0,8], and then the entire row is followed by a copy where the first element is 8. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, let's look at Example 1. The input is 6x6, output is 12x12. So the same pattern: each dimension is doubled. Let's check the first input row of Example 1: [0,5,0,0,0,0]. The output starts with [8,5,0,0,0,8,8,5,0,0,0,8]. So each element in the input is turned into two elements. For example, 0 becomes 8 and 5 becomes 5, but then followed by another 8 and 5? Not sure. The input row has 0,5,0,0,0,0. The output row starts with 8,5,0,0,0,8, then repeats 8,5,0,0,0,8. So perhaps each input element is duplicated with some substitution.\n\nWait, looking at the first output row of Example 1: [8,5,0,0,0,8, 8,5,0,0,0,8]. So the input row is [0,5,0,0,0,0]. It seems like the 0 in the first position becomes 8 and 8, but the 5 becomes 5 and 5. Then the rest 0s become 0 and 0, but then the last 0 becomes 8 and 8. Not sure. Alternatively, maybe the input row is mirrored with some 8s added. \n\nAlternatively, the pattern could be that each element is transformed into a 2x2 block where:\n\n- If the element is non-zero (like 2,5,4, etc.), the block is [element, 8; 8, element].\n\n- If the element is zero, the block is [0,8;8,0].\n\nBut in Example 0's input, the 2s would become [[2,8],[8,2]], and the 0s would become [[0,8],[8,0]]. Let's check if that works for Example 0's output.\n\nOriginal input matrix:\n\nRow0: [2,0,0]\n\nRow1: [0,0,0]\n\nRow2: [0,0,2]\n\nSo each element becomes a 2x2 block. The output should be 3*2=6 rows, each with 3*2=6 elements.\n\nLet's construct row by row.\n\nOriginal row 0: [2,0,0]\n\nExpanding each element:\n\n2 \u2192 [2,8; 8,2]\n\n0 \u2192 [0,8; 8,0]\n\n0 \u2192 [0,8; 8,0]\n\nSo the first two rows of the output would be:\n\nRow0: 2,8 | 0,8 | 0,8 \u2192 [2,8,0,8,0,8]\n\nRow1:8,2 |8,0 |8,0 \u2192 [8,2,8,0,8,0]\n\nBut the actual output's first two rows are:\n\n[2,0,8,2,0,8]\n\n[8,0,8,8,0,8]\n\nHmm, this doesn't match. So maybe my initial hypothesis is wrong.\n\nLet me look at Example 2 again. Input is 2x2, output 4x4.\n\nInput row0: [0,4]\n\nExpanding each element as 2x2 blocks:\n\n0 \u2192 [0,8;8,0]\n\n4 \u2192 [4,8;8,4]\n\nSo the output rows for row0 would be:\n\nFirst block row: 0,8 |4,8 \u2192 [0,8,4,8]\n\nSecond block row:8,0 |8,4 \u2192 [8,0,8,4]\n\nBut the actual output for Example 2's first two rows are:\n\n[0,4,0,4]\n\n[0,8,0,8]\n\nSo that doesn't match. So perhaps the 2x2 block for a non-zero element is [element, element; 8,8], and for zero, [0,0; 8,8]?\n\nWait, looking at Example 2:\n\nInput [0,4] \u2192 output row0: [0,4,0,4]. So each element is duplicated. Then row1: [0,8,0,8]. So for 0, it's 0 then 8, and for 4, it's 4 then 8. So maybe each input row is split into two rows: the first is the original elements duplicated, and the second is the same elements but replacing non-zero with 8s.\n\nWait, for input element 4, the first row has 4 duplicated (4,4), and the second row has 8,8. For 0, first row has 0,0 and second has 8,8. But in Example 2's output, the first row is [0,4,0,4] and the second is [0,8,0,8]. So for 0, it's 0 in the first row and 8 in the second. For 4, it's 4 in both first and second row? That doesn't fit. Wait, the second row of Example 2 is [0,8,0,8], so the 4 becomes 8 in the second row. Wait, maybe non-zero elements in the input are duplicated in the first row, and then 8 in the second row. For zeros, they are duplicated in the first row, and 8 in the second. But then in Example 0's input, the 2 would be duplicated as 2,2 in the first row and 8,8 in the second. Let's check.\n\nTake Example 0's first input row [2,0,0]. If each element is duplicated in the first row and replaced with 8 in the second, then:\n\nRow0: 2,2 | 0,0 |0,0 \u2192 [2,2,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow1:8,8 |8,8 |8,8 \u2192 [8,8,8,8,8,8]\n\nBut the actual output rows are different. So this approach is not correct.\n\nAlternative approach: Maybe the output is generated by mirroring the input matrix and inserting 8s between elements. For example, each row is duplicated and interleaved with 8s. But looking at Example 0's output:\n\nOriginal input rows are 3 elements. Output rows are 6 elements, which is 3*2. So perhaps each element is followed by an 8, and then the row is mirrored. For example, the input row [2,0,0] becomes [2,0,0, 0,0,2] but with some 8s inserted. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, each input row is mirrored, and each element is followed by an 8. For example, input row [2,0,0] would become [2,8,0,8,0,8, mirrored as 0,8,0,8,2,8]. Not matching.\n\nAlternatively, the output is generated by tiling the input matrix in a certain way, with 8s filling the gaps. Let's think of each input element being placed in a 2x2 grid, and the surrounding filled with 8s. For example, 2 becomes:\n\n2 8\n\n8 2\n\nBut in Example 0's output, the first row is [2,0,8,2,0,8]. Maybe each element is placed in the top-left of its 2x2 block, and the rest are 8s. But zeros remain zeros. Let's see:\n\nOriginal row [2,0,0]. Each element is placed in the top-left of a 2x2 block, and the next positions (to the right and below) are 8s. So:\n\nFor 2: [2,8][8,8]\n\nFor 0: [0,8][8,8]\n\nBut this doesn't fit the output. The first row of the output for Example 0 is [2,0,8,2,0,8]. Maybe each element is followed by an 8, then the row is duplicated with 8s. For example:\n\nOriginal row [2,0,0] becomes [2,8,0,8,0,8], and then mirrored or something. But the actual first row is [2,0,8,2,0,8], which seems like [2,0,0] transformed into [2,0,8] and then repeated. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe each row is duplicated, and after each element, an 8 is inserted. Then the entire row is followed by itself with 8s replacing certain elements. For Example 0's row0:\n\nOriginal row [2,0,0]. Insert 8 after each element: [2,8,0,8,0,8]. Then duplicate this row but replace the original numbers with 8s? But the output's first row is [2,0,8,2,0,8]. Not sure.\n\nAnother angle: Let's look at the positions of the original numbers in the input and see where they appear in the output.\n\nIn Example 0, the input has 2s at (0,0) and (2,2). The output has 2s at positions (0,0), (0,3), (3,0), (3,3), (2,2), (2,5), (5,2), (5,5). Wait, maybe the output is the original matrix duplicated in a 2x2 grid, with some modifications.\n\nFor instance, the input matrix is placed in the four corners of the output matrix, scaled by 2. Each original element appears in the top-left, top-right, bottom-left, bottom-right of their respective quadrants, with 8s filling the other positions. But this might be too vague.\n\nAlternatively, the output is a combination of the original matrix and its rotations. For example, the original matrix is placed in the top-left, then mirrored, rotated, etc., and filled with 8s. But need to check.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is created by interleaving the original rows and columns with 8s. For example, each row is followed by a row of 8s, and each column is followed by a column of 8s. But the examples don't seem to support that.\n\nLet me look at Example 2 again. The input is:\n\n[0,4]\n\n[0,0]\n\nThe output is 4 rows and 4 columns. The output rows are:\n\n[0,4,0,4]\n\n[0,8,0,8]\n\n[0,4,0,4]\n\n[0,8,0,8]\n\nSo for each row in the input, there are two output rows. The first output row is the original row duplicated (so [0,4] becomes [0,4,0,4]), and the second row is [0,8,0,8]. For the input row [0,0], the output rows are [0,0,0,0] and [0,8,0,8], but actually, the output is [0,4,0,4] and [0,8,0,8] for the first two rows. Wait, no. Wait, the input row [0,4] leads to [0,4,0,4] and [0,8,0,8]. Then the input row [0,0] becomes [0,4,0,4] and [0,8,0,8] again? Wait, no. The third and fourth output rows for Example 2 are [0,4,0,4] and [0,8,0,8]. But the second input row is [0,0]. So maybe even the 0s in the input are being replaced with 4s? That doesn't make sense.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each input row is transformed into two output rows by replacing each element with the original value and then 8, but only for non-zero elements. Wait, in Example 2's input row [0,4], the first output row is [0,4,0,4], which is duplicating the elements. The second output row is [0,8,0,8], which replaces the 4 with 8. So for non-zero elements, they are duplicated in the first row and replaced with 8 in the second row. Zeros remain zeros in the first row and become 8s in the second.\n\nWait, that makes sense. Let's test this pattern:\n\nFor each element in the input:\n\n- In the first output row, the element is duplicated (appear twice).\n\n- In the second output row, if the element is non-zero, it becomes 8, otherwise remains 0.\n\nBut in Example 2's first input row [0,4], the first output row is [0,4,0,4], which is each element duplicated. Then the second output row for that input row is [0,8,0,8], so 0 becomes 0 and 8, and 4 becomes 8 and 8? Wait, but the 4 becomes two 8s. So perhaps for non-zero elements, they are replaced by two 8s in the second row, and zeros become two 0s?\n\nWait, no. The second row for [0,4] input is [0,8,0,8]. So each element is replaced by 0 and 8 for zero, and 8 and 8 for non-zero. Hmm, perhaps for each element in the input row:\n\n- In the first output row of the two generated for each input row, each element is duplicated (so 0 becomes 0,0; 4 becomes 4,4).\n\n- In the second output row, if the element is zero, it becomes 0,8; if non-zero, it becomes 8,8.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nExample 2's input row [0,4]:\n\nFirst output row: 0,0 | 4,4 \u2192 [0,0,4,4] but the actual output is [0,4,0,4]. Oh, so perhaps the elements are duplicated, but interleaved. Like, for input row [0,4], the first output row is [0,4, 0,4], which is each element followed by itself again. Then the second row is [0,8, 0,8], which is 0 followed by 8, and 4 replaced by 0 followed by 8? No, because the 4 is replaced by 8. So maybe for non-zero elements, in the second row, they are replaced by 8. So for each element in the input row, you generate two elements per row. For the first row, you duplicate the element. For the second row, you replace the element with 0 if it was 0, and 8 if it was non-zero. Then, each input row is transformed into two output rows.\n\nWait, let's test this:\n\nFor Example 2's input row [0,4]:\n\nFirst output row: 0,4 (duplicated) \u2192 [0,4, 0,4]. Because each element is duplicated, so 0 becomes 0,0 and 4 becomes 4,4. Wait, but the output row is [0,4,0,4]. So it's [0,4, 0,4], which is each element followed by itself. So each element is duplicated once, but in sequence. Then the second row is [0,8, 0,8]. So for each element in the input row, if it's zero, it becomes 0 followed by 8; if it's non-zero, it becomes 8 followed by 8. So for 0 \u2192 0,8 and for 4 \u2192 8,8. But in the actual output row, the second row is [0,8,0,8]. So for 0, it's 0 and 8, and for 4, it's 8 and 8. Then the row becomes 0,8, 0,8. Wait, that fits. Because 4 in the input is replaced by 8,8 in the second row. So for the input row [0,4], the two output rows are:\n\nRow1: 0,4, 0,4 \u2192 each element duplicated.\n\nRow2:0,8, 0,8 \u2192 0 becomes 0 and 8, 4 becomes 8 and 8.\n\nWait, but in Example 2's output, the second row is [0,8,0,8]. So yes, that matches. So this seems to be the pattern.\n\nNow let's apply this to Example 0:\n\nInput row [2,0,0] \u2192 first output row is [2,2, 0,0, 0,0] \u2192 but wait, no. The actual output row for Example 0's first input row is [2,0,8,2,0,8]. So this doesn't fit. Hmm. So perhaps the pattern is different.\n\nWait, let's look at Example 1's input and output. The input row [0,5,0,0,0,0] becomes output rows:\n\n[8,5,0,0,0,8,8,5,0,0,0,8]\n\n[8,8,0,0,0,8,8,8,0,0,0,8]\n\nEtc. So each input row is transformed into two rows. The first output row starts with 8,5,... and ends with 8. The second output row has 8,8,... and ends with 8.\n\nMaybe the pattern is that each input row is mirrored, and each element is replaced with 8 except for the original non-zero elements. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation involves expanding the matrix by a factor of 2 in both dimensions, and filling new positions with 8s, except where the original elements are non-zero, which are duplicated.\n\nBut how? For example, in Example 0, input is 3x3. Output is 6x6. Each original element is placed at (2i, 2j), and the surrounding positions are filled with 8s. Let's check:\n\nFor the input element 2 at (0,0) in a 3x3 matrix, the output positions would be:\n\n(0,0), (0,1), (1,0), (1,1).\n\nIf we place 2 at (0,0) and (1,1) (diagonal), and 8s elsewhere in the block. So the block for 2 would be:\n\n2 8\n\n8 2\n\nFor the 0 elements, their block would be:\n\n0 8\n\n8 0\n\nBut in Example 0's output, the first row is [2,0,8,2,0,8]. Wait, if the original element (0,1) is 0, then its block would be [0,8;8,0], so the first two rows would have:\n\nFor (0,0) \u2192 2 8\n\nFor (0,1) \u2192 0 8\n\nFor (0,2) \u2192 0 8\n\nBut the output row is [2,0,8,2,0,8]. Hmm, maybe this approach isn't correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is constructed by placing the original matrix in the top-left, then its mirror image in the top-right, bottom-left, and bottom-right, with 8s filling the gaps. For example, the input matrix is placed in each quadrant, but mirrored and with 8s added. For Example 0, the input is:\n\n2 0 0\n\n0 0 0\n\n0 0 2\n\nThe output would be:\n\n[2,0,0 | 0,0,2]\n\n[0,0,0 | 0,0,0]\n\n[0,0,2 | 2,0,0]\n\nBut with 8s in between. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the original matrix repeated four times in a 2x2 grid, with each repetition separated by 8s. But I need to think differently.\n\nAnother approach: Let's check the sum of elements in the input and output. For Example 0, input has 2 + 2 =4. Output has multiple 2s and 8s. The output in Example 0 has 2s in positions (0,0), (0,3), (2,2), (2,5), (3,0), (3,3), (5,2), (5,5). That's 8 instances of 2. So each 2 in the input becomes four 2s in the output. Wait, original input has two 2s, output has eight 2s. 2*4=8. So each 2 is multiplied by 4.\n\nSimilarly, 8s are introduced. For Example 0's input, the output has a lot of 8s. So perhaps each original element is multiplied into a 2x2 block where:\n\n- For non-zero elements: the block is [element, 8; 8, element]\n\n- For zero elements: the block is [0, 8; 8, 0]\n\nBut when I tried this earlier, it didn't fit.\n\nLet me try applying this to Example 0's input:\n\nOriginal element 2 would become:\n\n2 8\n\n8 2\n\nOriginal element 0 would become:\n\n0 8\n\n8 0\n\nSo the input matrix:\n\nRow0: 2 0 0\n\nRow1: 0 0 0\n\nRow2: 0 0 2\n\nTransformed into 2x2 blocks:\n\nRow0 would be:\n\n2 8 | 0 8 | 0 8 \u2192 which becomes [2,8,0,8,0,8]\n\n8 2 |8 0 |8 0 \u2192 [8,2,8,0,8,0]\n\nRow1:\n\n0 8 |0 8 |0 8 \u2192 [0,8,0,8,0,8]\n\n8 0 |8 0 |8 0 \u2192 [8,0,8,0,8,0]\n\nRow2:\n\n0 8 |0 8 |2 8 \u2192 [0,8,0,8,2,8]\n\n8 0 |8 0 |8 2 \u2192 [8,0,8,0,8,2]\n\nBut the actual output of Example 0 is:\n\nRow0: [2,0,8,2,0,8]\n\nRow1: [8,0,8,8,0,8]\n\nRow2: [8,0,2,8,0,2]\n\nRow3: [2,0,8,2,0,8]\n\nRow4: [8,0,8,8,0,8]\n\nRow5: [8,0,2,8,0,2]\n\nThis doesn't match. For example, the first row in our hypothetical transformation is [2,8,0,8,0,8], but the actual output's first row is [2,0,8,2,0,8]. So our initial hypothesis is incorrect.\n\nLet me try another angle. Looking at Example 0's output:\n\nEvery other row and column seems to have 8s. The pattern in the output for Example 0 seems to be that the original elements are placed at the corners of each 3x3 block in the output. Wait, the output is 6x6, so perhaps each original element is placed in positions (i*2, j*2) and (i*2+1, j*2+1), and the surrounding positions are filled with 8s. Let's see:\n\nFor the input element 2 at (0,0):\n\nOutput positions (0,0) and (1,1) would be 2, and surrounding (0,1) and (1,0) would be 8s.\n\nBut in the output's first row [2,0,8,2,0,8], there's a 2 at position (0,0), then 0 at (0,1), which doesn't fit. Alternatively, perhaps the original elements are placed at even indices and their mirrored positions, with 8s filling the rest.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the output of Example 0, the first row has 2, 0, 8, 2, 0, 8. This seems like the original row [2,0,0] is interleaved with [2,0,0] again but with 8s added. So [2,0,0] becomes [2,0,0, 2,0,0] but with 8s inserted after each element. Not sure.\n\nAnother observation: In Example 0, the output rows 0, 3 are the same; rows 1,4 are the same; rows 2,5 are the same. Similarly, in Example 1, the output has repeating patterns every 6 rows. So the output is the input matrix scaled by 2 in each dimension, then repeated.\n\nAlternatively, the pattern might be that each row in the input is duplicated twice, and each element is replaced by itself and 8 in some pattern, then the entire row is repeated.\n\nAlternatively, the output could be the Kronecker product of the input matrix with another matrix. For example, if each element a is replaced by a matrix [a, 8; 8, a]. Let's test this for Example 0.\n\nFor element 2: [[2,8],[8,2]]\n\nFor element 0: [[0,8],[8,0]]\n\nSo the input matrix:\n\nRow0: 2 0 0 \u2192 becomes:\n\nRow0: [2,8, 0,8, 0,8]\n\nRow1: [8,2, 8,0, 8,0]\n\nRow1: 0 0 0 \u2192 becomes:\n\nRow2: [0,8, 0,8, 0,8]\n\nRow3: [8,0, 8,0, 8,0]\n\nRow2: 0 0 2 \u2192 becomes:\n\nRow4: [0,8, 0,8, 2,8]\n\nRow5: [8,0, 8,0, 8,2]\n\nBut comparing this to Example 0's actual output:\n\nOutput rows:\n\n[2,0,8,2,0,8]\n\n[8,0,8,8,0,8]\n\n[8,0,2,8,0,2]\n\n[2,0,8,2,0,8]\n\n[8,0,8,8,0,8]\n\n[8,0,2,8,0,2]\n\nThis doesn't match. So the Kronecker product approach with [a,8;8,a] isn't the pattern.\n\nPerhaps the Kronecker product with a different matrix, like [1,1;1,1] but replaced with 8s. Or something else.\n\nAlternatively, for each input element, generate a 2x2 block where:\n\n- If the element is non-zero: [element, 8; 8, element]\n\n- If the element is zero: [8, 8; 8, 8]\n\nBut looking at Example 0's output, there are zeros present, so this can't be.\n\nAlternatively, zeros are treated differently. For zeros, the block is [0,8;8,0], and non-zero are [element, 8;8, element].\n\nBut when we look at Example 0's first row, which should be 2,0,0, the first row of blocks would be 2's block followed by two 0's blocks. So:\n\nRow0: 2,8 |0,8 |0,8 \u2192 [2,8,0,8,0,8]\n\nRow1:8,2 |8,0 |8,0 \u2192 [8,2,8,0,8,0]\n\nBut the actual output's first row is [2,0,8,2,0,8]. So this doesn't match. So perhaps the block is different.\n\nAnother idea: Each element is replaced by two elements in the row and two in the column. For example, each element becomes a 2x2 block where the original is at the top-left and bottom-right, and 8 elsewhere. So:\n\nFor element a:\n\n[a, 8]\n\n[8, a]\n\nBut for Example 0's first row:\n\n2 becomes [2,8][8,2], but the row would be 2,8 followed by 0,8 for the next element, but the actual output row is 2,0,8,2,0,8. This doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, each element is followed by 8, and then the row is duplicated with 8s replacing the non-zero elements. For example:\n\nOriginal row [2,0,0] becomes:\n\nRow0: [2,8, 0,8, 0,8]\n\nRow1: [8,8, 8,8, 8,8]\n\nBut the actual output's first two rows are [2,0,8,2,0,8] and [8,0,8,8,0,8]. Not matching.\n\nAlternatively, the output is generated by taking the input matrix, then for each row, inserting a new row below it where each non-zero element is replaced by 8. For example, in Example 0:\n\nInput row [2,0,0] \u2192 output rows [2,0,0, 2,0,0] and [8,0,8,8,0,8]. But not sure.\n\nAlternatively, each row in the input is duplicated, and between the duplicates, 8s are inserted. For example, input row [2,0,0] becomes [2,0,0] followed by [8,0,8] and then repeated. But this doesn't fit the output.\n\nWait, looking at Example 0's output rows:\n\nThe first three rows are:\n\n[2,0,8,2,0,8]\n\n[8,0,8,8,0,8]\n\n[8,0,2,8,0,2]\n\nThen rows 3-5 repeat the first three.\n\nSo the output is the original transformed rows repeated twice. So perhaps each input row is transformed into three rows, but Example 0's input has three rows, and the output has six rows. So each input row becomes two output rows. So the first three input rows each become two output rows, totaling six.\n\nWait, Example 0's input is 3x3, output 6x6. So each row becomes two rows. Let's look at the first input row [2,0,0]. The first two output rows are:\n\nRow0: [2,0,8,2,0,8]\n\nRow1: [8,0,8,8,0,8]\n\nThen the third input row [0,0,2] becomes two output rows:\n\nRow2: [8,0,2,8,0,2]\n\nRow3: [2,0,8,2,0,8] \u2192 Wait, no. The output rows are:\n\nRow0: [2,0,8,2,0,8]\n\nRow1: [8,0,8,8,0,8]\n\nRow2: [8,0,2,8,0,2]\n\nRow3: [2,0,8,2,0,8]\n\nRow4: [8,0,8,8,0,8]\n\nRow5: [8,0,2,8,0,2]\n\nSo each input row is transformed into two output rows, but the output rows for the second input row (which is all zeros) are:\n\nIf input row is [0,0,0], then the output rows would be [0,0,8,0,0,8] and [8,0,8,8,0,8]. But in Example 0's output, rows 1 and 4 are [8,0,8,8,0,8], which might correspond to the second input row. So perhaps for each input row, the first output row is the original elements interleaved with 8s and the original elements again, and the second output row is 8s interleaved with 0s and 8s.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each element in the input row is replaced with a pair: the original element and 8. Then, the entire row is followed by a row where each element is 8 and the original element. For example:\n\nInput row [2,0,0] becomes:\n\nRow0: [2,8,0,8,0,8]\n\nRow1: [8,2,8,0,8,0]\n\nBut this doesn't fit Example 0's first two rows, which are [2,0,8,2,0,8] and [8,0,8,8,0,8].\n\nThis is getting complicated. Maybe I should look for a different pattern.\n\nLet's try to see if the output is created by concatenating the input matrix with a modified version of itself. For instance, each row is duplicated and modified. For Example 0's first input row [2,0,0], the output rows are:\n\nRow0: [2,0,8,2,0,8]\n\nRow1: [8,0,8,8,0,8]\n\nThe row seems to be composed of two copies of the original row, with 8s inserted. For example, the first part is [2,0,8] and the second part is [2,0,8]. But where does the 8 come from?\n\nAlternatively, the output rows are created by taking the input row, adding 8s between elements, then appending a mirrored version. For example, [2,0,0] becomes [2,0,8,0,0], but not sure.\n\nAnother observation: The output for Example 0 has a structure where every third element is an 8. For example, in the first row: 2,0,8,2,0,8. The 8s are at positions 2 and 5. Similarly, the second row has 8s at positions 0,2,3,5.\n\nWait, maybe the output matrix is formed by placing the original matrix in the top-left and bottom-right quadrants, and filling the rest with 8s. For Example 0's input 3x3, the output is 6x6. If we split it into four 3x3 quadrants:\n\nTop-left: original matrix.\n\nTop-right: 8s.\n\nBottom-left: 8s.\n\nBottom-right: original matrix.\n\nBut this would result in 8s in the top-right and bottom-left quadrants. But looking at Example 0's output:\n\nThe first row is [2,0,8,2,0,8]. The first three elements are 2,0,8 and the next three are 2,0,8. So the top-right quadrant isn't all 8s. So this is not the case.\n\nAnother approach: The output matrix seems to have a pattern where each original element is followed by 8, and the row is repeated with 8s replacing the non-zero elements.\n\nFor Example 0's first input row [2,0,0], the first output row is [2,0,8, 2,0,8]. This could be the original row followed by the original row again, with 8s inserted after each element. Then the second output row is [8,0,8, 8,0,8], which is 8s replacing the non-zero elements (2 becomes 8) and 0s remaining. So each input row generates two output rows:\n\n- The first row: original elements followed by 8, and then the same again.\n\n- The second row: 8 followed by 0 or 8 (depending on original element), repeated.\n\nBut this needs to be checked.\n\nFor Example 0's input row [2,0,0]:\n\nFirst output row: [2,0,8,2,0,8]\n\nSecond output row: [8,0,8,8,0,8]\n\nSo the first row is the original elements each followed by 8, then the original elements again each followed by 8. Wait, but [2,0,0] \u2192 2,0,8, then 2,0,8 \u2192 but how? Maybe each element is replaced by itself and 8, and the row is duplicated. So [2,0,0] becomes [2,8, 0,8, 0,8] and then repeated. But that's [2,8,0,8,0,8, 2,8,0,8,0,8], which is longer than the output. So not.\n\nAlternatively, the first row is the original elements followed by their mirror image, with 8s inserted. But this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, the output is created by taking each row of the input and transforming each element into a two-element pair. For non-zero elements, the pair is [element, 8]; for zero elements, the pair is [0,8]. Then the row is duplicated. For Example 0's input row [2,0,0]:\n\nTransformed pairs: [2,8], [0,8], [0,8]. So the row becomes [2,8,0,8,0,8]. Then duplicated, giving two rows: same each time. But the actual output for Example 0's first two rows are [2,0,8,2,0,8] and [8,0,8,8,0,8], which doesn't match.\n\nAlternatively, maybe for non-zero elements, the pair is [element, 8], and for zeros, [0, 8]. Then, for each row, this sequence is followed by the same sequence but with non-zero elements replaced by 8. So:\n\nFor [2,0,0], the first part is [2,8,0,8,0,8], then the second part is [8,8,0,8,0,8]. Combined, this gives a row of [2,8,0,8,0,8,8,8,0,8,0,8], but Example 0's output rows are only six elements long, so this doesn't fit.\n\nAnother observation: In Example 0's output, the 2s are placed at the beginning and end of certain rows. For instance, the first row starts and ends with 2 and 8. The third row starts with 8 and ends with 2. Maybe there's a diagonal pattern where the original elements are placed at certain positions with 8s around them.\n\nAlternatively, the output matrix could be a combination of the original matrix and its transpose, but scaled with 8s. But I'm not sure.\n\nThis is taking a long time. Perhaps I should look for a different pattern. Let's think about the examples:\n\nExample 0:\n\nInput:\n\n[2,0,0]\n\n[0,0,0]\n\n[0,0,2]\n\nOutput:\n\n[2,0,8,2,0,8]\n\n[8,0,8,8,0,8]\n\n[8,0,2,8,0,2]\n\nThen repeats.\n\nNotice that the output has the original 2s at positions (0,0), (0,3), (2,2), (2,5), and their mirror positions in the lower half. So perhaps the output is constructed by placing the original matrix in the top-left and bottom-right quadrants, and filling the remaining quadrants with 8s. But how does that fit with the rows?\n\nAlternatively, the output is generated by tiling the input matrix in a 2x2 pattern, with 8s in the off-diagonal tiles. For example:\n\nTop-left: original matrix\n\nTop-right: original matrix with 8s added\n\nBottom-left: original matrix with 8s added\n\nBottom-right: original matrix\n\nBut Example 0's input is 3x3. Output is 6x6. So if we split into four 3x3 quadrants:\n\nTop-left: original matrix.\n\nTop-right: each element is 8 if original is non-zero, else same.\n\nBottom-left: same as top-right.\n\nBottom-right: original matrix.\n\nBut this would require more analysis.\n\nAlternatively, for each element in the input matrix, in the output matrix, the element is placed at (2i,2j) and (2i+1,2j+1), and 8s are placed elsewhere. For example, input element at (i,j) is placed at (2i, 2j) and (2i+1, 2j+1) in the output, and the other positions in the 2x2 block are 8s.\n\nLet's test this hypothesis for Example 0:\n\nInput element (0,0) is 2. Output positions (0,0) and (1,1) would be 2. Positions (0,1) and (1,0) would be 8.\n\nInput element (0,1) is 0. Output positions (0,2) and (1,3) would be 0. Positions (0,3) and (1,2) would be 8.\n\nInput element (0,2) is 0. Output positions (0,4) and (1,5) would be 0. Positions (0,5) and (1,4) would be 8.\n\nSo the first two output rows would be:\n\nRow0: 2,8, 0,8, 0,8\n\nRow1:8,2,8,0,8,0\n\nBut the actual output's first two rows are:\n\nRow0:2,0,8,2,0,8\n\nRow1:8,0,8,8,0,8\n\nThis doesn't match. So this approach isn't correct.\n\nAnother idea: Each element in the input matrix is duplicated in the output, but each row is interleaved with a row of 8s. For Example 0's input row [2,0,0], output rows would be [2,0,0] and [8,8,8], but this is not the case.\n\nAlternatively, each row in the input is turned into two rows in the output: the first row is the original elements followed by themselves, and the second row is all 8s. But in Example 0's output, the second row isn't all 8s.\n\nAfter struggling with various hypotheses, perhaps I should consider that the output is formed by duplicating each row and column, replacing certain elements with 8s.\n\nFor each row in the input, you duplicate it, and insert 8s between elements. For example, input row [2,0,0] becomes [2,8,0,8,0,8], then duplicated as a row. But this doesn't fit the output.\n\nAlternatively, each element is followed by an 8, and each row is followed by a row where each element is 8, except for zeros which stay 0. For example, input row [2,0,0] becomes:\n\nRow0: 2,8,0,8,0,8\n\nRow1:8,8,8,8,8,8\n\nBut Example 0's first two rows are [2,0,8,2,0,8] and [8,0,8,8,0,8]. So this isn't matching.\n\nAnother possible pattern: The output matrix is formed by rotating the input matrix 180 degrees and appending it to the original, then inserting 8s in between. For Example 0's input:\n\nOriginal matrix:\n\n2 0 0\n\n0 0 0\n\n0 0 2\n\nRotated 180:\n\n2 0 0\n\n0 0 0\n\n0 0 2\n\nSo it's the same. But appending and inserting 8s would create a different structure.\n\nAlternatively, the output is the original matrix and its mirror image merged, with 8s filling the gaps. But again, not sure.\n\nAt this point, I think I need to find a different approach. Let's compare the inputs and outputs to see if there's a common transformation.\n\nLooking at Example 2:\n\nInput is 2x2 matrix:\n\n[0,4]\n\n[0,0]\n\nOutput is 4x4:\n\n[0,4,0,4]\n\n[0,8,0,8]\n\n[0,4,0,4]\n\n[0,8,0,8]\n\nSo each input row is duplicated. The first row of the input [0,4] becomes two output rows:\n\n[0,4,0,4] and [0,8,0,8]\n\nSo the first row is the input row elements duplicated, and the second row replaces the non-zero element (4) with 8, while keeping zeros as 0.\n\nSo the pattern seems to be:\n\nFor each row in the input:\n\n- Generate two output rows.\n\n- The first output row duplicates each element: each element is followed by itself.\n\n- The second output row duplicates each element, but non-zero elements are replaced with 8, while zeros remain 0.\n\nSo for Example 2's input row [0,4]:\n\nFirst output row: [0,4,0,4] (each element duplicated)\n\nSecond output row: [0,8,0,8] (0 remains 0, 4 becomes 8)\n\nThis pattern fits Example 2.\n\nTesting this on Example 0's first input row [2,0,0]:\n\nFirst output row would be [2,2,0,0,0,0] (each element duplicated)\n\nSecond output row would be [8,8,0,0,0,0] (non-zero elements become 8)\n\nBut the actual output for Example 0's first two rows are [2,0,8,2,0,8] and [8,0,8,8,0,8]. So this doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. So maybe the duplication is not element-wise but row-wise.\n\nWait, in Example 2, each input row is transformed into two output rows where each element is duplicated in the first row and replaced with 8 (if non-zero) in the second. But the actual output is different. Maybe the duplication is column-wise. For example, each element is repeated twice in the row direction, and each row is repeated twice in the column direction with modification.\n\nAlternatively, the output for each input row is:\n\n- The first output row is the input row with each element duplicated (appearing twice).\n\n- The second output row is the same, but non-zero elements are replaced with 8.\n\nBut in Example 2's first input row [0,4], the first output row is [0,4,0,4] and the second is [0,8,0,8]. This fits.\n\nFor Example 0's input row [2,0,0], the first output row would be [2,2,0,0,0,0], but the actual first output row is [2,0,8,2,0,8]. So this doesn't fit.\n\nSo this pattern works for Example 2 but not Example 0. What's different between Example 0 and Example 2?\n\nAnother observation: In Example 0's output, the first row is [2,0,8,2,0,8]. This can be seen as the original row [2,0,0] followed by the same row [2,0,0], but with the third element replaced by 8. Alternatively, each element is followed by 8 except the last, which is replaced by 8.\n\nAlternatively, each element is followed by 8 if it's the last in the row, but not sure.\n\nAnother approach: Let's look at the positions of the original elements in the output.\n\nIn Example 0's output, the 2s are at:\n\n(0,0), (0,3), (2,2), (2,5), (3,0), (3,3), (5,2), (5,5)\n\nThis suggests that each original element is placed at (i*2, j*2) and (i*2+1, j*2+1). For example, the input element at (0,0) is at (0,0) and (1,1) in the output, but in Example 0's output, (0,0) is 2 and (1,1) is 0. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, the input matrix is scaled by a factor of 2 in each dimension, and each element is placed at (i*2, j*2) and (i*2+1, j*2+1), with 8s filling the other positions. But in Example 0's output, (0,0) is 2, (0,1) is 0, which would be part of the scaled matrix. Hmm, this doesn't fit.\n\nAfter trying various hypotheses without success, perhaps I should consider that the output is constructed by creating a larger matrix where each element from the input is replaced with a 2x2 block that depends on the element's value and position. For example, non-zero elements are replaced with a block that includes the element and 8s, while zeros are replaced with a different pattern.\n\nLooking at Example 2's output again:\n\nInput [0,4] becomes [0,4,0,4] and [0,8,0,8]. So each element is duplicated in the row. The first row duplicates the elements, and the second row replaces non-zero elements with 8, but zeros remain. So for each input element:\n\n- First output row: element, element.\n\n- Second output row: if element is zero \u2192 0, 8; else \u2192 8,8.\n\nWait, in Example 2's second output row for the input row [0,4], it's [0,8,0,8]. So 0 becomes 0,8 and 4 becomes 8,8. So for each element in the input row, the first output row is element followed by element, and the second row is element followed by 8 if element is zero, else 8 followed by 8.\n\nBut in Example 0's first input row [2,0,0], applying this would give:\n\nFirst output row: 2,2,0,0,0,0.\n\nSecond output row:8,8,0,8,0,8.\n\nBut the actual output for Example 0's first two rows is:\n\n[2,0,8,2,0,8]\n\n[8,0,8,8,0,8]\n\nThis doesn't match. So perhaps the pattern is different for non-zero elements.\n\nAlternative idea: For each element in the input:\n\n- If the element is zero, it's replaced with two 0s in the first output row and 0 followed by 8 in the second.\n\n- If the element is non-zero, it's replaced with the element followed by 8 in the first output row, and 8 followed by the element in the second output row.\n\nLet's test this for Example 0's input row [2,0,0]:\n\nFirst output row: 2,8 | 0,0 |0,0 \u2192 [2,8,0,0,0,0]\n\nSecond output row:8,2 |0,8 |0,8 \u2192 [8,2,0,8,0,8]\n\nBut the actual first two rows are [2,0,8,2,0,8] and [8,0,8,8,0,8]. So this doesn't fit.\n\nBut wait, perhaps for non-zero elements:\n\nFirst output row: element, 8\n\nSecond output row:8, element\n\nFor zero elements:\n\nFirst output row: 0, 0\n\nSecond output row:0,8\n\nSo applying this to Example 0's first input row [2,0,0]:\n\nFirst output row:2,8,0,0,0,0 \u2192 but actual is [2,0,8,2,0,8]\n\nNo, doesn't match.\n\nAlternatively, non-zero elements are replaced by element, 8, and zero elements by 0,8.\n\nThen, for input row [2,0,0], first output row would be 2,8,0,8,0,8.\n\nSecond output row would be 8,2,8,0,8,0.\n\nBut Example 0's first two rows are [2,0,8,2,0,8] and [8,0,8,8,0,8], which doesn't fit.\n\nThis is quite challenging. Perhaps I need to find another approach. Let's consider that the output is formed by applying a specific transformation to each row and column.\n\nLooking at Example 0's output:\n\nEach row in the output has elements that are either 0, 2, or 8. The 2s appear in positions that were originally 2 in the input, and 8s fill the gaps.\n\nSimilarly, in Example 1's output, the 5s are present in the first row, and 8s are abundant.\n\nIn Example 2's output, the 4s are duplicated in the first and third rows, and replaced by 8s in the second and fourth.\n\nThis suggests that non-zero elements are being duplicated in certain positions and 8s are added elsewhere.\n\nAnother observation: The output matrices seem to have the original elements in specific positions and 8s filling the rest. For example, in Example 0, the 2s are in the corners and the middle of the output matrix.\n\nAlternatively, the output is generated by rotating the input matrix 90 degrees and interleaving with 8s, but I'm not sure.\n\nAt this point, I think I need to look for a different pattern. Let's consider the following:\n\nThe output matrix is created by expanding each element into a 2x2 block. The block for a non-zero element is:\n\n[element, 8]\n\n[8, element]\n\nAnd for zero elements:\n\n[0, 8]\n\n[8, 0]\n\nBut when applied to Example 0, this doesn't produce the correct output. Let's try:\n\nOriginal input matrix:\n\nRow0: [2,0,0]\n\nRow1: [0,0,0]\n\nRow2: [0,0,2]\n\nExpanding each element into 2x2 blocks:\n\nRow0:\n\n2 \u2192 [2,8;8,2]\n\n0 \u2192 [0,8;8,0]\n\n0 \u2192 [0,8;8,0]\n\nSo the first two rows of the output would be:\n\nRow0: 2,8,0,8,0,8\n\nRow1:8,2,8,0,8,0\n\nRow2:\n\n0 \u2192 [0,8;8,0]\n\n0 \u2192 [0,8;8,0]\n\n0 \u2192 [0,8;8,0]\n\nRow2 of input becomes:\n\nRow2:0,8,0,8,0,8\n\nRow3:8,0,8,0,8,0\n\nRow4:\n\n0 \u2192 [0,8;8,0]\n\n0 \u2192 [0,8;8,0]\n\n2 \u2192 [2,8;8,2]\n\nRow4:0,8,0,8,2,8\n\nRow5:8,0,8,0,8,2\n\nBut the actual output is:\n\n[2,0,8,2,0,8]\n\n[8,0,8,8,0,8]\n\n[8,0,2,8,0,2]\n\n[2,0,8,2,0,8]\n\n[8,0,8,8,0,8]\n\n[8,0,2,8,0,2]\n\nThis doesn't match. So this hypothesis is incorrect.\n\nAnother approach: The output for each example seems to have a symmetry. For example, Example 0's output has rows 0 and 3 the same, 1 and 4 the same, and 2 and 5 the same. This suggests that the output is formed by repeating the transformed input matrix twice.\n\nSo perhaps the input matrix is transformed into a certain structure, then that structure is repeated to form the output. For Example 0, the transformed structure is three rows, and it's repeated twice to form six rows. Similarly for the columns.\n\nBut how is each element transformed?\n\nAlternatively, the output is formed by concatenating the transformed input matrix with a modified version of itself where non-zero elements are replaced with 8s.\n\nFor Example 0, the transformed input matrix is:\n\n[2,0,8]\n\n[8,0,8]\n\n[8,0,2]\n\nThen concatenated with the same matrix to form six rows. But Example 0's output has six rows, with the first three rows and then the same three again. So this matches.\n\nBut how is the transformed input matrix obtained from the original?\n\nIn Example 0, the original matrix is:\n\n2 0 0\n\n0 0 0\n\n0 0 2\n\nThe transformed matrix is:\n\n2 0 8\n\n8 0 8\n\n8 0 2\n\nBut how?\n\nLooking at the transformed matrix, it seems like each row is the original row with the last element replaced by 8, and then some modifications. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, each element in the original matrix is shifted right, and the last element is replaced by 8. But this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, the transformed matrix is obtained by appending 8s in certain positions. For example, each row is the original row followed by its reverse, with 8s added. But not sure.\n\nAt this point, I'm stuck. I'll try to look for another pattern.\n\nIn Example 0's output, the first three rows are:\n\n[2,0,8,2,0,8]\n\n[8,0,8,8,0,8]\n\n[8,0,2,8,0,2]\n\nThen repeated.\n\nNotice that the first three rows can be divided into two halves:\n\nFirst half: [2,0,8], [8,0,8], [8,0,2]\n\nSecond half: [2,0,8], [8,0,8], [8,0,2]\n\nSo each half is the same. This suggests that the output is the transformed matrix concatenated with itself horizontally.\n\nSo each row in the transformed matrix is [2,0,8], then duplicated to [2,0,8,2,0,8].\n\nThis would imply that each row in the input is transformed into a row that's the original elements plus 8s, then duplicated.\n\nBut how to get [2,0,8] from the input row [2,0,0]?\n\nPerhaps each input row is transformed into a new row by keeping the first element, replacing the middle with 0, and the last with 8. But this is speculative.\n\nAlternatively, the transformed row is the original row with each element followed by 8, then the original row again. For example, [2,0,0] becomes [2,8,0,8,0,8], but this doesn't fit the output.\n\nGiven the time I've spent without success, I think I should make an educated guess based on Example 2 and Example 0.\n\nIn Example 2, each input row is transformed into two output rows. The first row is the input elements duplicated (each element appears twice), and the second row is 0 and 8 for zeros and 8 and 8 for non-zeros.\n\nApplying this to Example 0's input row [2,0,0]:\n\nFirst output row: 2,2,0,0,0,0 \u2192 but the actual first row is [2,0,8,2,0,8]. Doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, in Example 2, each element is duplicated in the same row and then followed by a row where non-zero elements become 8s. So for input row [0,4], the first output row is [0,4,0,4] (duplicated), and the second is [0,8,0,8] (non-zero becomes 8).\n\nApplying this to Example 0's input row [2,0,0]:\n\nFirst output row: 2,0,0, 2,0,0 \u2192 but the actual first row is [2,0,8,2,0,8].\n\nAlternatively, the output rows are the input row followed by the input row with non-zero elements replaced by 8, and each element followed by 8. For example:\n\nInput row [2,0,0] \u2192 first row: 2,0,0 followed by 2,0,0, with 8s inserted after each element.\n\nWhich would be 2,8,0,8,0,8, 2,8,0,8,0,8 \u2192 but the output is only six elements. So perhaps it's 2,0,8 followed by 2,0,8.\n\nBut how to get from [2,0,0] to [2,0,8,2,0,8]?\n\nMaybe each input row is duplicated, and between them, 8s are inserted. For example, [2,0,0] becomes [2,0,0, 8, 2,0,0], but this doesn't fit.\n\nAnother idea inspired by Example 2's output: The output rows are generated by taking the input row and appending a reversed version of it, replacing non-zero elements with 8s. For Example 2's input row [0,4], the reversed row is [4,0], and replacing non-zero with 8 gives [8,0]. So appending gives [0,4,8,0], which doesn't match the output [0,4,0,4].\n\nNot quite.\n\nGiven the time constraints, I'll make a guess based on the pattern observed in Example 2 and apply it to the test input.\n\nThe pattern seems to be:\n\nFor each row in the input:\n\n- Create two output rows.\n\n- The first output row is the original elements, each followed by the same element again (duplicated).\n\n- The second output row is the original elements, each followed by 8 if non-zero, else 0.\n\nBut wait, in Example 2's output:\n\nInput row [0,4] becomes [0,4,0,4] and [0,8,0,8]. So each element is duplicated in the first row. In the second row, 0 becomes 0 and 8, and 4 becomes 8 and 8.\n\nSo for each element in the input row:\n\n- First output row: element, element.\n\n- Second output row: 0,8 if element is 0; 8,8 if element is non-zero.\n\nApplying this to the test input:\n\nTest input is a 4x4 matrix:\n\n[0,0,3,0]\n\n[0,0,0,0]\n\n[0,0,0,3]\n\n[3,0,0,0]\n\nEach row will generate two output rows.\n\nLet's process each input row:\n\nFirst input row [0,0,3,0]:\n\nFirst output row: each element duplicated \u2192 [0,0,0,0,3,3,0,0]\n\nBut according to the pattern from Example 2, the first output row for each input element is duplicated. So this row becomes [0,0,0,0,3,3,0,0]. However, in Example 0's output, the first row for input [2,0,0] is [2,0,8,2,0,8], which doesn't fit this pattern. So my earlier hypothesis is incorrect.\n\nGiven the time I've spent without a clear pattern, I'll have to make an educated guess based on Example 2's pattern and apply it to the test input, hoping for the best.\n\nAssuming that each input row is transformed into two output rows:\n\n- First row: each element is duplicated (element, element).\n\n- Second row: each element is replaced by 0 and 8 if element is 0, or 8 and 8 if element is non-zero.\n\nApplying this to the test input:\n\nFirst row of test input: [0,0,3,0]\n\nFirst output row: [0,0,0,0,3,3,0,0]\n\nSecond output row: [0,8,0,8,8,8,0,8]\n\nSecond input row: [0,0,0,0]\n\nFirst output row: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nSecond output row: [0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8]\n\nThird input row: [0,0,0,3]\n\nFirst output row: [0,0,0,0,0,0,3,3]\n\nSecond output row: [0,8,0,8,0,8,8,8]\n\nFourth input row: [3,0,0,0]\n\nFirst output row: [3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nSecond output row: [8,8,0,8,0,8,0,8]\n\nThen, according to Example 0 and 2's outputs, the resulting output would have each input row's two output rows, and the entire matrix would be repeated twice vertically (as in Example 0).\n\nBut I'm not sure. However, looking at the test input's expected output, considering the pattern from Example 2, the output for the test input would have each row duplicated with 8s replacing non-zero elements in the second row.\n\nThus, the final answer should follow this pattern.",

        "cot_2": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. So, looking at the training examples, I need to see how the input matrices are transformed into the output matrices. Let's start with Example 0.\n\nIn Example 0, the input is a 3x3 matrix with 2s at the corners and the center. The output is a 6x6 matrix. The original elements seem to be placed in a pattern. For instance, the first row of the input [2,0,0] becomes [2,0,8,2,0,8] in the output. Wait, so maybe each element in the input is being expanded into a 2x2 block in the output? Let me check.\n\nOriginal input is 3x3, output is 6x6, which is double the size. So each element becomes a 2x2 block. Let's see: the 2 in the first row first column becomes 2 and then 8 in the next row? Wait, the first output row is [2,0,8,2,0,8]. Hmm, maybe the 2 is transformed into 2 and 8, and 0s stay as 0s. Let's look at another example.\n\nIn Example 2, the input is 2x2. The output is 4x4. Each element in the input is duplicated into a 2x2 block. For example, the input [0,4] becomes [0,4,0,4] in the first output row, then [0,8,0,8], then repeats. Wait, so maybe each element is being replaced by a 2x2 block where the original number is kept, but if there's a non-zero, perhaps 8 is added in certain positions. Like, in Example 2, the 4 becomes 4 and 8. The first row of the input is [0,4], output first row is [0,4,0,4], second row [0,8,0,8]. So the 4 is transformed into 4 and 8 in adjacent rows. Similarly, when there's a 5 in Example 1, it's surrounded by 8s.\n\nWait, maybe the pattern is that each element in the input is expanded into a 2x2 block. For non-zero elements, the original value is placed in the top-left of the 2x2 block, and 8 is placed in other positions. But looking at Example 0, the 2s in the input become 2, 8, 8, 2 in their 2x2 blocks. Wait, the first row of input is [2,0,0]. The output first row is [2,0,8,2,0,8]. So each element in the input is replaced by two elements in the output row? Wait, maybe each element is duplicated horizontally and vertically, but with some modification. Let's think again.\n\nWait, Example 0's input is 3x3, output is 6x6. So each input row becomes two output rows, and each input element becomes two elements. Let's see the first input row [2,0,0]. The first two output rows are:\n\n[2, 0, 8, 2, 0, 8]\n[8, 0, 8, 8, 0, 8]\n\nSo for the element 2 in position (0,0), it's transformed into 2 and 8 in the first two rows. Then, for the 0s, they remain 0 in the first row and 8 in the second? Or perhaps the 8 is added around non-zero elements. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is created by tiling the input in a 2x2 pattern, but modifying certain positions. For example, in Example 0, the output looks like the original matrix is mirrored or tiled with some 8s inserted. Wait, the output rows repeat the original input elements but interleaved with 8s. Let me check:\n\nOriginal input for Example 0 has 2 at (0,0), (2,2). The output for the first row is [2,0,8,2,0,8]. So maybe each element in the input is followed by 8, but not sure. Alternatively, the input is expanded by a factor of 2 in both dimensions, and 8s are placed in the new positions adjacent to non-zero elements.\n\nAnother approach: look for the positions of non-zero numbers in the input and see how they appear in the output. For instance, in Example 0, the 2s are at the corners and center. In the output, the 2s appear in the first and fourth positions of the first row. Wait, the first row of output is [2,0,8,2,0,8]. So it's like the original row [2,0,0] is duplicated, but with 8s inserted between them. Wait, original input row has 3 elements, output row has 6 elements. So each element is doubled. But with 2 becoming [2,8], 0 becoming [0,8]? No, because in the first row of Example 0's output, the first element is 2, then 0, then 8. Wait, maybe each element is followed by an 8. But that would make [2,8, 0,8, 0,8], but the actual output is [2,0,8,2,0,8]. Hmm, that doesn't fit.\n\nWait, looking at Example 2's input [0,4] and [0,0]. The output rows for the first input row are [0,4,0,4], then [0,8,0,8], then repeats. So the 4 is duplicated, but the next row has 8s where the 4s were. So maybe when a non-zero is present, in the next row of the same block, it becomes 8. So each input element is turned into a 2x2 block. For a non-zero value x, the block is:\n\nx x\n\nx 8?\n\nNo. In Example 2, the 4 in the input becomes in the output first row as 4, then 4 again (since the first output row is [0,4,0,4]), then the next row is [0,8,0,8]. So for the 4, the block is:\n\n[4, 4]\n\n[8, 8]\n\nWait, that's 2 rows and 2 columns. So the original 4 is in the first row, two copies, then the next row has 8s in those positions. Then the same for the next two rows, which are duplicates of the first two.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the input matrix is scaled by a factor of 2 in both dimensions, and for each original non-zero element, in the expanded 2x2 block, the original value is placed in the top-left, and the rest are 8s. For zeros, they remain 0 in the expanded block. Let's test this.\n\nTake Example 0's input [2,0,0] in the first row. The expanded 2x2 block for 2 would be:\n\n2 8\n\n8 8\n\nBut the first row of the output is [2, 0, 8, 2, 0, 8]. Wait, that doesn't fit. Because if each element is 2x2, then the first element 2 would take two columns. Let me try to map the input elements to the output blocks.\n\nOriginal input is 3 rows, 3 columns. Output is 6 rows, 6 columns. So each input row becomes two output rows, each input column becomes two output columns.\n\nSo for each input cell (i,j), it's mapped to a 2x2 block starting at (2i, 2j) in the output.\n\nNow, what's the rule for the 2x2 block. If the input cell is non-zero:\n\nThe top-left of the block is the original value.\n\nThe other three positions (top-right, bottom-left, bottom-right) are 8.\n\nIf the input cell is zero, then all four positions in the block are zero.\n\nWait, let's test this with Example 0.\n\nOriginal input has 2 at (0,0). In the output, the first two rows and two columns would be:\n\n[2, 8]\n\n[8, 8]\n\nBut looking at the first output row of Example 0:\n\n[2,0,8,2,0,8]\n\nWait, the first element is 2, then 0, then 8. That doesn't fit. Hmm. Maybe the expansion is different. Alternatively, maybe each input element is duplicated into a 2x2 block where non-zero elements have 8s in the duplicates, but the original is kept once.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to mirror the input matrix both horizontally and vertically, inserting 8s in certain positions.\n\nAlternatively, looking at Example 1's input, which is 6x6. The output is 12x12. Let's see the first row of input is [0,5,0,0,0,0]. The first row of the output is [8,5,0,0,0,8,8,5,0,0,0,8]. So the 5 is followed by 0s and then 8. It seems like the input is mirrored and surrounded by 8s. Wait, the output row starts with 8, then 5, then zeros, then 8, then 8,5 again, etc. Maybe the input is duplicated and wrapped with 8s.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the pattern is that each non-zero element in the input is surrounded by 8s in the output, and the original elements are placed at intervals. But how?\n\nWait, let's think of Example 2. Input is 2x2. Output is 4x4. The first row of input is [0,4], output first row is [0,4,0,4], then the next row [0,8,0,8], then repeats. So the 4 is duplicated in the same row, and in the next row, 8s are placed where the 4s were. Then the same pattern repeats again. So it's like the original 2x2 is tiled 2x2 times, but with modifications. So the output is double the size in both dimensions, but each original element is transformed into a 2x2 tile. For non-zero elements, the tile is [x, x; 8,8], but for zeros, it's [0,0;0,0]. Wait, but in the output of Example 2, the 4s are duplicated in the same row, and then replaced by 8s in the next row.\n\nSo the 2x2 tile for 4 would be:\n\nRow 1: 4, 4\n\nRow 2: 8, 8\n\nAnd for 0:\n\nRow 1: 0,0\n\nRow 2:0,0\n\nBut then, since the input is 2x2, the output is 4x4. So each input cell becomes a 2x2 tile. So the first row of the input [0,4] would become:\n\nRow 1 of output: 0,0,4,4\n\nRow 2 of output: 0,0,8,8\n\nBut in the given example, the first row of output is [0,4,0,4], which doesn't fit. Hmm. Wait, maybe the tiling is done differently. Maybe the input is repeated twice in each direction, but modified. For example, the input row [0,4] becomes [0,4,0,4] in the first output row, then [0,8,0,8] in the second row, then the same pattern again. So the entire input is scaled by 2x2, but each element is duplicated in the row and then the next row has 8s where the non-zero elements were.\n\nWait, perhaps the transformation is as follows: For each element in the input, create two rows in the output. The first row duplicates the element and its next element (from the original row) with an 8 added after non-zero elements. Then the next row replaces the non-zero elements with 8s. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, let's look at Example 1's input. The input is 6x6, output is 12x12. The input has 5s in positions (0,1), (4,0), (4,5). The output for the first row starts with [8,5,0,0,0,8,8,5,0,0,0,8]. So the 5 is placed at position 1 and 7 (if 0-based), which suggests that each input row is duplicated, with 8s inserted around. For example, the original row [0,5,0,0,0,0] becomes in the output two rows. Wait, but the output rows are 12 elements long. So each input row becomes two output rows, each twice as long. Maybe each element in the input row is replaced by two elements: the original and 8 if non-zero, or 0 and 0 if zero. Then the next row is 8s where there were non-zeros and 0s otherwise. Let's test that.\n\nIn Example 1's first input row: [0,5,0,0,0,0]. If each element becomes two elements in the output row:\n\nFor 0: 0,0\n\nFor 5:5,8\n\nThen the first output row would be [0,0,5,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]. But the actual output is [8,5,0,0,0,8,8,5,0,0,0,8]. Hmm, that doesn't align. Maybe each element is followed by an 8, but leading with an 8.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is formed by concatenating the input row with a modified version of it, where non-zero elements are replaced by 8, and then stacking these modified rows. For example, take the input row, duplicate it, but in the second duplicate replace non-zero elements with 8. Then each input row becomes two rows in the output. Then, perhaps the entire matrix is duplicated again horizontally. Wait, in Example 0's input, the output rows are twice the length. So each input row becomes two rows, each of double the columns. So for each element in the input row, generate two elements: original and 8 (if non-zero) or 0 and 0. Then, the next row is 8s in the same positions.\n\nAlternatively, let's think of each input element being transformed into two elements in the same row. For non-zero x, it becomes x followed by 8. For zero, it remains 0 followed by 0. Then, each input row is transformed into a row of double the length. Then, after that, another row is added which has 8s where the original row had non-zeros and 0s otherwise, but each element is followed by 8 again.\n\nWait, but looking at Example 0's first input row [2,0,0]. The first output row is [2,0,8,2,0,8]. So if each element is transformed into two elements: for 2, it's 2 and 8; for 0, it's 0 and 8? But that would make [2,8,0,8,0,8], which doesn't match. But the actual output is [2,0,8,2,0,8]. Hmm. Maybe the elements are grouped in threes. Wait, the input row has 3 elements, output row has 6 elements. So each element is duplicated with 8 added alternately. But I'm not seeing it.\n\nAnother approach: look at the positions of the original numbers in the output. For Example 0, the original 2s are in positions (0,0), (0,3), (2,2), (2,5), etc. So maybe the input matrix is being tiled 2 times in both directions, but with 8s inserted in between. For example, the original matrix is mirrored both horizontally and vertically, and 8s are placed in the new positions. But how?\n\nAlternatively, the output is created by surrounding each non-zero element with 8s in a larger matrix. For example, each non-zero in the input is placed in a 2x2 block with 8s around. But that might not fit the examples.\n\nWait, let's try to see the structure of Example 0's output. The output is 6x6. The first row is [2,0,8,2,0,8]. The second row is [8,0,8,8,0,8]. Third row [8,0,2,8,0,2]. Then rows 4-6 repeat the first three rows. So the output is a repetition of a 3-row pattern, but scaled. So the original 3x3 input is transformed into a 6x6 output by doubling each row and column, but inserting 8s and repeating.\n\nAlternatively, the input matrix is mirrored both horizontally and vertically, and each original element is followed by 8. But again, not sure.\n\nAnother observation: In Example 0's output, the number 8 is present in all positions except where the original 2s were and some 0s. Similarly, in Example 1's output, 8 is everywhere except where the original 5s and 0s are. So perhaps 8 is the default value, and the original non-zero elements are placed at certain intervals, possibly with duplicates.\n\nLooking at Example 0's output, the first two rows are:\n\n[2,0,8,2,0,8]\n[8,0,8,8,0,8]\n\nIf the input is 3x3, the output is 6x6. So each input row is represented by two output rows. Let's see: for the first input row [2,0,0], the first output row is [2,0,8,2,0,8]. Then the second row is [8,0,8,8,0,8]. Then the third row [8,0,2,8,0,2], which corresponds to the third input row [0,0,2]. Then the fourth row is a repeat of the first output row, etc. So perhaps the input is being vertically mirrored and each row is duplicated with 8s inserted. But the pattern is not clear.\n\nAlternatively, the output is a combination of the original matrix and its transformations. For example, each row in the input is duplicated, and between them, certain transformations are applied (like adding 8s).\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is generated by taking each row of the input, creating two new rows for each input row. The first new row is the original row with each non-zero element followed by an 8. The second new row is the same as the first, but with all non-zero elements replaced by 8. Then, the entire structure is mirrored vertically.\n\nWait, let's test this with Example 2. Input row 0 is [0,4]. Output rows are:\n\nRow 0: 0,4,0,4\n\nRow 1:0,8,0,8\n\nRow 2:0,4,0,4\n\nRow 3:0,8,0,8\n\nSo for each input row, two output rows are generated: the first is the original row duplicated horizontally (each element appears twice), and the second is the original row with non-zero elements replaced by 8 and duplicated. Then this is repeated again. So the input rows are each duplicated vertically twice, leading to four rows.\n\nBut how does that fit with the input size? For a 2x2 input, the output is 4x4. So each row is duplicated twice. Wait, the input has 2 rows. The output has 4 rows, which is 2 input rows multiplied by 2. Each input row is turned into two output rows. Then, each of those is duplicated again, making four rows. But in Example 2, the output has four rows, each duplicated twice. So the process is:\n\nFor each row in input:\n\n- create two rows: one where the non-zero elements are duplicated, and another where they are replaced by 8 and duplicated.\n\nThen, repeat the entire set of rows again.\n\nSo for Example 2's input [0,4], first output row is [0,4,0,4], then [0,8,0,8], then repeat those two rows again. So the output is 4 rows made by duplicating the two generated rows.\n\nApplying this to Example 0:\n\nInput is 3 rows. For each row, generate two rows, leading to 6 output rows. Which matches the output size of 6x6.\n\nSo the rule could be:\n\nFor each input row, create two new rows:\n\n- First new row: each element is duplicated. For non-zero elements, they are kept. For zeros, they remain zero.\n\n- Second new row: same as first, but non-zero elements are replaced by 8. Zeros remain zero.\n\nWait, but in Example 0's first input row [2,0,0], the first new row would be [2,2,0,0,0,0], but the actual first output row is [2,0,8,2,0,8]. Hmm, that doesn't fit. So maybe the duplication is different.\n\nAnother possibility: for each element in the input row, create two elements in the output row. For non-zero elements, the first is the original value, the second is 8. For zeros, both are 0.\n\nSo, input row [2,0,0] becomes [2,8,0,0,0,0]. But the actual first output row is [2,0,8,2,0,8]. Doesn't match.\n\nAlternatively, each element is followed by 8 if it's non-zero, and 0 if it's zero. So [2,0,0] becomes [2,8,0,0,0,0], but again doesn't match the first output row of Example 0.\n\nWait, Example 0's first output row is [2,0,8,2,0,8]. Let's break it down. The input row is [2,0,0]. So each element is somehow mapped to two elements. The first element 2 becomes 2 and 8. The second element 0 becomes 0 and 0. The third element 0 becomes 8 and 8? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the output row is the original row followed by a modified version where non-zero elements are replaced by 8. So [2,0,0] becomes [2,0,0, 8,0,0], but the actual output is [2,0,8,2,0,8]. Not matching.\n\nAnother approach: perhaps the output is generated by tiling the input matrix in a 2x2 grid, where each tile is a transformed version of the original. For example, the original matrix is placed in the top-left and bottom-right, and 8s are in the other positions.\n\nBut in Example 0's input, the original matrix is 3x3. The output is 6x6, which is a 2x2 tiling of the original matrix. But then the tiles would be arranged as:\n\n[original, transformed]\n\n[transformed, original]\n\nBut the transformed tiles might have 8s where non-zeros are.\n\nLooking at Example 0's output:\n\nThe first three rows of the output are:\n\nRow 0: [2,0,8,2,0,8]\n\nRow 1: [8,0,8,8,0,8]\n\nRow 2: [8,0,2,8,0,2]\n\nThen rows 3-5 repeat rows 0-2. So the output is two copies of a 3-row block. So perhaps the input is transformed into a 3x6 block, then duplicated vertically.\n\nAlternatively, the output is generated by first horizontally doubling each row with certain rules, then vertically doubling each row with other rules.\n\nAnother observation: in Example 0's output, the first three rows are repeated again. So the entire output is twice the input's size in both dimensions, but each row is repeated twice. Wait, but in Example 0, the input is 3x3, output is 6x6. So each row is duplicated once. But looking at the output rows:\n\nRow 0: [2,0,8,2,0,8]\n\nRow 1: [8,0,8,8,0,8]\n\nRow 2: [8,0,2,8,0,2]\n\nThen rows 3-5 are the same as 0-2. So the output is two copies of the first three rows. So vertically, the output is the input's row count doubled. But how are the rows generated?\n\nFor the first input row [2,0,0], the first two output rows are:\n\nRow0: [2,0,8,2,0,8]\n\nRow1: [8,0,8,8,0,8]\n\nSo for each input row, two output rows are generated. The first output row for an input row is the original row followed by a modified version where non-zero elements are replaced by 8 and some others. The second output row is the same as the first but with non-zero elements replaced by 8.\n\nWait, but for the first input row [2,0,0], the first output row is [2,0,8,2,0,8]. If we split it into two parts: [2,0,8] and [2,0,8]. So maybe each input row is duplicated horizontally, but in between, non-zero elements are replaced by 8.\n\nAlternatively, the output row is the input row concatenated with itself, but with non-zero elements replaced by 8. Wait, [2,0,0] concatenated with [8,0,8] gives [2,0,0,8,0,8], which doesn't match the first output row [2,0,8,2,0,8]. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, the output is generated by interleaving the original elements with 8s where non-zero. For example, for each element in the input row, if it's non-zero, insert an 8 after it; if zero, insert a 0. So [2,0,0] becomes [2,8, 0,0, 0,0]. But the first output row is [2,0,8,2,0,8]. Doesn't fit.\n\nLet me try to find another angle. Looking at Example 1's input and output:\n\nInput row 0: [0,5,0,0,0,0]\n\nOutput row 0: [8,5,0,0,0,8,8,5,0,0,0,8]\n\nThis is a 12-element row. The input row has 6 elements. So each element becomes two elements. Let's see how. The first element is 0, which becomes 8 and 5? No. Wait, the output starts with 8, then 5, which is the second element of the input row. Maybe the output row is built by surrounding the input elements with 8s. Like, before and after each non-zero element, place 8s. But how?\n\nAlternatively, the output rows are constructed by taking the input row, mirroring it, and inserting 8s between. For Example 0's first row, the original [2,0,0] is mirrored to [0,0,2], then combined with the original. So [2,0,0,0,0,2], but then 8s are inserted. Not matching.\n\nAlternatively, the output is a combination of the original matrix and a transformed version where non-zero elements are replaced by 8, both horizontally and vertically concatenated. For Example 0, the input is 3x3. The output is the original matrix (3x3) concatenated horizontally with the transformed matrix (non-zero to 8) (3x3), then vertically concatenated with the transformed matrix and the original matrix. But this would create a 6x6 matrix. Let's check:\n\nOriginal matrix:\n\n[2,0,0]\n\n[0,0,0]\n\n[0,0,2]\n\nTransformed matrix (non-zero to 8):\n\n[8,0,0]\n\n[0,0,0]\n\n[0,0,8]\n\nHorizontal concatenation of original and transformed:\n\n[2,0,0,8,0,0]\n\n[0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\n[0,0,2,0,0,8]\n\nVertical concatenation of transformed and original:\n\n[8,0,0,8,0,0]\n\n[0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\n[0,0,8,0,0,8]\n\n[2,0,0,8,0,0]\n\n[0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\n[0,0,2,0,0,8]\n\nBut this doesn't match Example 0's output. So this approach is incorrect.\n\nAnother observation: In Example 2's output, the 4 is present in the first and third rows, and 8s in the second and fourth. So perhaps the pattern is to duplicate each row, then in the next row replace non-zero with 8, and repeat this. So for input row [0,4], generate two rows: [0,4,0,4] and [0,8,0,8], then repeat those two rows again. So each input row is turned into four output rows by duplicating the two generated rows. But why?\n\nAlternatively, the output is created by doubling the size in both directions and inserting 8s around non-zero elements. For example, each non-zero element in the input creates a cross of 8s around it in the output. But this seems complex and not matching the examples.\n\nPerhaps the key is to look for the positions of the original numbers and the 8s. For example, in Example 0's output, the 2s are at positions where (i,j) is even (0,0; 0,3; 2,2; 2,5; etc.). The 8s are in between. So maybe each element in the input is placed at (2i, 2j) in the output, and the surrounding cells are filled with 8s. Let's check:\n\nIn Example 0's input, the 2 at (0,0) would be placed at (0,0) in the output. Then, the adjacent cells (0,1), (1,0), (1,1) would be filled with 8s. But looking at the output's first row, which is [2,0,8,2,0,8]. There's a 2 at (0,0), then 0, then 8. Hmm, this doesn't fit. The adjacent cells are not filled with 8s.\n\nAlternatively, the input is scaled by a factor of 2, and each input cell is placed at (2i, 2j) in the output. The surrounding cells (even positions?) are filled with 8s if the original cell was non-zero. But again, the Example 0 output doesn't show this.\n\nAt this point, I'm a bit stuck. Let's try to see if there's a pattern in the numbers. The outputs include a lot of 8s, which suggests that 8 is a key part of the transformation. The original numbers are preserved in some positions, but surrounded by 8s.\n\nAnother idea: the output is the Kronecker product of the input matrix with a certain 2x2 matrix. For example, if each non-zero element is replaced by the matrix [[x,8],[8,8]] and zeros are replaced by [[0,0],[0,0]]. Let's test this.\n\nFor Example 0's input [2,0,0] in the first row:\n\nThe Kronecker product would be:\n\n[2 8 | 0 0 | 0 0\n\n8 8 | 0 0 | 0 0\n\n...]\n\nBut the first row of output is [2,0,8,2,0,8], which doesn't align. Alternatively, if non-zero elements are replaced by [[x,8],[8,8]], then for the first row of input:\n\n2 becomes [2,8]\n\n0 becomes [0,0]\n\n0 becomes [0,0]\n\nSo the first row would be [2,8,0,0,0,0], which doesn't match the output [2,0,8,2,0,8]. So this approach is incorrect.\n\nAnother observation: The number 8 appears in positions where the sum of indices (i+j) is odd. For example, in Example 0's first output row [2,0,8,2,0,8], the 8s are at positions 2 and 5 (0-based: 2 and 5). For i=0, j=2: 0+2=2 even. Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, perhaps 8s are in every even column.\n\nWait, let's look at the first output row of Example 0: [2,0,8,2,0,8]. The positions with 8 are 2, 3, 5? No. Positions 2 and 5 (0-based) have 8. So columns 2 and 5. The input row is [2,0,0], which is three elements. The output row has six elements. So columns 0,1,2,3,4,5. The 8s are at columns 2 and 5. Which would correspond to the original elements' positions multiplied by 2 plus 1. For example, the first element (0,0) in the input becomes column 0 in output, then 0*2=0, then 0*2+1=1. But there's no 8 there. This isn't working.\n\nAnother idea: the output is created by replacing each element in the input with a 2x2 block where the original element is placed in the top-left and 8s elsewhere if the element is non-zero. For zeros, the block is all zeros. Let's test this.\n\nExample 0's first input row [2,0,0] becomes:\n\n[2,8][0,0][0,0]\n\nThen, the second row of the block would be [8,8][0,0][0,0].\n\nBut the first output row is [2,0,8,2,0,8]. This doesn't fit. So this approach is incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is a combination of the input matrix and its mirror images, with 8s inserted. For example, the original matrix is placed in the top-left, the mirror image in the top-right, bottom-left, and bottom-right, but with 8s in certain positions. However, without clear mirroring in the examples, this is hard to confirm.\n\nAt this point, perhaps I should look for a pattern in the examples that I can apply to the test input. Let's consider the test input:\n\nTest Input:\n\n[0, 0, 3, 0]\n\n[0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n[0, 0, 0, 3]\n\n[3, 0, 0, 0]\n\nThis is a 4x4 matrix. According to the pattern, the output should be a larger matrix. Looking at the examples:\n\nExample 0: 3x3 \u2192 6x6\n\nExample 1:6x6 \u2192 12x12\n\nExample 2:2x2 \u21924x4\n\nSo the output is double the size of the input in both dimensions. So the test input is 4x4, so the output should be 8x8.\n\nNow, what's the transformation rule?\n\nIn Example 2, the input is:\n\n[0,4]\n\n[0,0]\n\nOutput is 4x4:\n\nRow 0: [0,4,0,4]\n\nRow 1: [0,8,0,8]\n\nRow 2: [0,4,0,4]\n\nRow 3: [0,8,0,8]\n\nSo each input row is turned into two rows in the output. The first row duplicates the elements with non-zero values followed by the same non-zero. The second row replaces non-zero with 8s. Then this is repeated.\n\nFor example, the input row [0,4] becomes:\n\nFirst output row: [0,4,0,4] (duplicate each element)\n\nSecond output row: [0,8,0,8] (replace 4 with 8 in the duplicated positions)\n\nThen the same two rows are repeated again.\n\nApplying this to Example 0's input row [2,0,0]:\n\nFirst output row: [2,0,8,2,0,8]\n\nSecond output row: [8,0,8,8,0,8]\n\nBut how does this fit? It seems that for each element in the input row, it's duplicated, but with 8s inserted in certain places. For example, in the first output row of Example 0, the 2 is duplicated but with an 8 in between. Wait, [2,0,8,2,0,8]. It looks like the original row is followed by a transformed version where non-zero elements are replaced by 8. So [2,0,0] \u2192 [2,0,0] concatenated with [8,0,8], leading to [2,0,0,8,0,8]. But the actual output row is [2,0,8,2,0,8]. Hmm, not exactly.\n\nAnother pattern: for each input row, generate two output rows. The first output row is the input row with each element duplicated, but non-zero elements are followed by 8. The second output row is each element duplicated, but non-zero elements are replaced by 8 followed by 8. Zeros remain zero.\n\nFor Example 2's input row [0,4]:\n\nFirst output row: 0,4 \u2192 0,4, 0,4 (but wait, no 8s here. So this doesn't fit. Example 2's first output row is [0,4,0,4], which is just duplicated. Then the next row is [0,8,0,8], which is replacing 4 with 8 and duplicating.\n\nSo maybe the rule is:\n\nFor each input row, create two output rows.\n\n- The first output row is the input row with each element duplicated (each element appears twice in a row).\n\n- The second output row is the same, but any non-zero elements are replaced by 8.\n\nThen, this pair of rows is repeated once more (so each input row generates four output rows).\n\nWait, in Example 2, each input row generates two output rows, and since the input has two rows, the output has four rows. But in the example, the output is four rows, each duplicated twice. So each input row's two output rows are duplicated again. So the total output rows are 4 (2 input rows \u00d7 2 output rows per input row \u00d7 repeated once).\n\nBut this seems complicated. For the test input, which is 4x4, the output would be 8x8. Each input row would generate two output rows, and there are four input rows, leading to 8 output rows.\n\nBut what's the pattern for the columns?\n\nLooking at Example 2's input row [0,4] becomes [0,4,0,4] and [0,8,0,8]. So each element is duplicated in the row. So each element in the input row is doubled in the output row. So for a 4-element input row, the output row has 8 elements.\n\nSo the transformation rule seems to be:\n\nFor each input row:\n\n- Generate two output rows:\n\n   a. The first row is the input row with each element duplicated. Non-zero elements are kept as is.\n\n   b. The second row is the input row with each element duplicated, but non-zero elements are replaced by 8.\n\nThen, this pair of rows is repeated again, leading to four output rows per input row. Wait, but in Example 2, the input has two rows, each generating two output rows, totaling four rows. But the output has four rows, each of which is duplicated. So perhaps each input row's two generated rows are repeated once. So for each input row, generate two output rows, then repeat them once.\n\nSo for Example 2's input row [0,4], the two generated rows are [0,4,0,4] and [0,8,0,8], which are then repeated once, leading to four rows.\n\nApplying this to the test input:\n\nTest input has four rows. Each row generates two output rows, which are repeated once, leading to 4 output rows per input row. So total 4 \u00d7 4 = 16 output rows. But the test input is 4x4, and the output should be 8x8. So this approach is not matching.\n\nHmm. Perhaps the pattern is that each input row is transformed into two output rows, and each input column is transformed into two output columns. So each element in the input is turned into a 2x2 block. For non-zero elements, the block is:\n\nx 8\n\n8 8\n\nFor zero elements, the block is:\n\n0 0\n\n0 0\n\nBut let's test this with Example 2's input:\n\nInput row [0,4] would become:\n\nFor 0: 0 0\n\n        0 0\n\nFor 4:4 8\n\n        8 8\n\nSo the first output row would be [0,0,4,8], then the second row [0,0,8,8], and the same for the next two rows. But the actual output for Example 2 is:\n\n[0,4,0,4]\n\n[0,8,0,8]\n\n[0,4,0,4]\n\n[0,8,0,8]\n\nWhich suggests that each element is duplicated in the row and the next row has 8s. So for 4, the first row has two 4s and the next has two 8s.\n\nSo the rule could be:\n\nFor each element in the input, when expanding into a 2x2 block in the output:\n\n- If the element is non-zero:\n\n   First row of the block: [x, x]\n\n   Second row of the block: [8, 8]\n\n- If the element is zero:\n\n   First row of the block: [0, 0]\n\n   Second row of the block: [0, 0]\n\nSo for Example 2's input [0,4]:\n\nFirst row of the block for 0: [0,0]\n\nSecond row: [0,0]\n\nFor 4: [4,4]\n\nSecond row: [8,8]\n\nSo combining, the first output rows would be [0,0,4,4] and [0,0,8,8]. But the actual output is [0,4,0,4] and [0,8,0,8]. So perhaps the blocks are interleaved. Maybe each element's block is interleaved with the next element's block. Hmm, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the entire row is processed as follows:\n\nFor each input row, create two output rows. The first output row is the input row with each element duplicated (each element appears twice), and the second output row is the same, but non-zero elements are replaced by 8. So for Example 2's input row [0,4], the first output row is [0,0,4,4], and the second is [0,0,8,8]. But the actual output is [0,4,0,4] and [0,8,0,8]. So this doesn't fit. Unless the duplication is done in a different way.\n\nWait, Example 2's output rows are [0,4,0,4], which is the original elements duplicated in the even positions. So for row [0,4], the first output row is 0,4 repeated twice. So the elements are interleaved with zeros. No, the first output row is [0,4,0,4], which is the original row followed by the original row again. So [0,4] becomes [0,4,0,4]. Then the second row is [0,8,0,8], which is the original row with non-zero replaced by 8, then repeated. Then this pattern is repeated again.\n\nSo for each input row, generate two rows: the original row duplicated, and the row with non-zero elements replaced by 8 and duplicated. Then repeat those two rows again.\n\nThus, for the test input, each row would generate two rows (original duplicated and 8s duplicated), then repeat once, leading to four rows per input row. Since the test input has four rows, this would lead to 16 output rows, which is not possible since the output should be 8x8. So this approach is not correct.\n\nAnother observation: The output matrices seem to have a vertical reflection. For example, in Example 0's output, the first three rows are repeated again. This suggests that the output is created by appending the transformed matrix below itself. Similarly for horizontal reflection.\n\nBut I'm not making progress. Let's try to think of the test input and what the expected output would be based on the examples.\n\nTest input:\n\n[0,0,3,0]\n\n[0,0,0,0]\n\n[0,0,0,3]\n\n[3,0,0,0]\n\nThis is a 4x4 matrix. Following the pattern of doubling the size, the output should be 8x8.\n\nLooking at Example 1's input, which is 6x6, the output is 12x12. The output rows have non-zero elements (5 and 8) arranged in a pattern where the original elements are placed at intervals, surrounded by 8s. For example, the first output row is [8,5,0,0,0,8,8,5,0,0,0,8]. So the 5 is placed in the second and eighth positions (0-based). The input row was [0,5,0,0,0,0], and in the output, the 5 appears in positions 1 and 7, which are odd. So perhaps each input element is placed at position 2i+1 in the output row, surrounded by 8s.\n\nAlternatively, for each non-zero element in the input, it is placed in the output at (2i, 2j) and (2i, 2j+1), with 8s around.\n\nBut this is getting too vague. Given the time I have, I'll try to deduce the pattern as follows:\n\nEach input element is duplicated in the output, both horizontally and vertically. For non-zero elements, their duplicates are replaced with 8s. For example:\n\nOriginal element x (non-zero) becomes:\n\nx 8\n\n8 8\n\nFor zero elements:\n\n0 0\n\n0 0\n\nSo, for each input element, we create a 2x2 block. Applying this to the entire matrix.\n\nLet's test this with Example 0's input:\n\n[2,0,0]\n\n[0,0,0]\n\n[0,0,2]\n\nThe first row becomes:\n\n2 8 | 0 0 | 0 0\n\n8 8 | 0 0 | 0 0\n\nSecond row (all zeros):\n\n0 0 | 0 0 | 0 0\n\n0 0 | 0 0 | 0 0\n\nThird row:\n\n0 0 | 0 0 | 2 8\n\n0 0 | 0 0 | 8 8\n\nBut the output of Example 0 is different. For example, the first row of the output is [2,0,8,2,0,8], which doesn't fit this structure. So this approach is incorrect.\n\nAnother possibility: the output is created by interleaving the original matrix with a matrix of 8s, where the original non-zero elements are placed in certain positions.\n\nFor example, in Example 0, the output's first row has 2, then 0, then 8, then 2, etc. It seems like the original matrix is placed in the even columns and the 8s in the odd columns. But how?\n\nAlternatively, the output is the original matrix expanded with 8s in every other column and row. For example, insert a column of 8s after each original column, and a row of 8s after each original row. But the examples don't match this.\n\nAt this point, I think I need to proceed to apply the pattern I think is correct based on Example 2 and Example 0.\n\nIn Example 2, the input is 2x2. The output is 4x4. Each input element is duplicated in the row, and for non-zero elements, the next row has 8s in the same columns. So for input [0,4], output is:\n\nRow 0: 0,4,0,4\n\nRow 1: 0,8,0,8\n\nRow 2: 0,4,0,4\n\nRow 3:0,8,0,8\n\nSo each input row is duplicated twice. First, the original elements are duplicated in the row, then the next row has 8s where non-zero elements were. Then this pair of rows is repeated again.\n\nApplying this to the test input:\n\nTest input has four rows. Each row will generate two output rows (original duplicated and 8s duplicated), then repeated once. So each input row leads to four output rows. But since the input has four rows, the output would have 4\u00d74=16 rows. This contradicts the expected output size of 8x8.\n\nAlternatively, each input row generates two output rows (original duplicated and 8s duplicated), and the total output rows are 4\u00d72=8. Which makes sense for the test input (4x4 input \u2192 8x8 output).\n\nSo the rule is:\n\nFor each input row:\n\n1. Create a new row by duplicating each element. For example, [0,0,3,0] becomes [0,0,0,0,3,3,0,0].\n\nWait, no. In Example 2, input [0,4] becomes [0,4,0,4] and [0,8,0,8]. So each element is duplicated in the row. So [0,0,3,0] would become [0,0,0,0,3,3,0,0], but this doesn't match the pattern. Wait, no. In Example 2, the input row [0,4] becomes [0,4,0,4] (each element is duplicated in the row, but spaced out). Wait, the input row is [0,4], which is two elements. The output row is four elements, which is two elements duplicated. So [0,4] becomes [0,4,0,4], which is the original row followed by itself. But then the next row is [0,8,0,8], which is the same pattern but with 4s replaced by 8s.\n\nSo for the test input row [0,0,3,0], the first output row would be [0,0,3,0,0,0,3,0], but that doesn't fit. Wait, perhaps the duplicated elements are placed in the even positions. For example, the first output row is the original elements placed in even indices, and the next row has 8s in even indices where non-zero elements were.\n\nAlternatively, for each input row, create two output rows:\n\n- The first output row is the original row concatenated with the original row again. For example, [0,0,3,0] becomes [0,0,3,0,0,0,3,0].\n\n- The second output row is the original row concatenated with itself, but with non-zero elements replaced by 8. So [0,0,8,0,0,0,8,0].\n\nThen, each pair of rows is repeated again. So for each input row, four output rows are generated.\n\nBut this would lead to 4 input rows \u00d7 4 output rows each = 16 rows, which is not possible. So this approach is incorrect.\n\nGiven the time constraints, I'll make an educated guess based on Example 0 and 2.\n\nAssuming that each non-zero element in the input is surrounded by 8s in the output, and the output is double the size. For the test input, which has 3s in positions (0,2), (2,3), (3,0), the output would have these 3s placed in even positions, surrounded by 8s.\n\nFor example, the first row of the test input is [0,0,3,0]. In the output, the 3 would be at (0,4) and (0,5) (if columns are doubled). But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, each non-zero element x in the input is placed in the output at (2i, 2j) and (2i, 2j+1) as x and 8. The next row would have 8 and 8. So for the 3 at (0,2) in the input:\n\nOutput rows:\n\nRow 0: [0,0,0,0,3,8,0,0]\n\nRow 1: [0,0,0,0,8,8,0,0]\n\nAnd this pattern continues for other non-zero elements.\n\nBut this is just a guess. Given the time I've spent and the examples, I'll proceed to write the output for the test input based on the pattern observed in Example 0 and 2.\n\nThe output for the test input would likely be each row duplicated with 8s replacing non-zero elements in subsequent rows. Each input row becomes two output rows: the first is the original row duplicated with non-zero elements repeated, and the second is the same with non-zero elements replaced by 8. Then, these two rows are repeated again.\n\nSo for the first input row [0,0,3,0]:\n\nFirst output row: [0,0,3,0,0,0,3,0]\n\nSecond output row: [0,0,8,0,0,0,8,0]\n\nThen repeat these two rows again.\n\nSimilarly for other rows with non-zero elements.\n\nApplying this to the test input, the output would be:\n\nFor each input row:\n\nRow 0: [0,0,3,0] \u2192 [0,0,3,0,0,0,3,0]\n\nRow 1: [0,0,8,0,0,0,8,0]\n\nRow 2: [0,0,3,0,0,0,3,0]\n\nRow 3: [0,0,8,0,0,0,8,0]\n\nThen for the second input row [0,0,0,0], since all are zeros:\n\nRow 4: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow 5: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow 6: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow 7: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nThird input row [0,0,0,3]:\n\nRow 8: [0,0,0,3,0,0,0,3]\n\nRow 9: [0,0,0,8,0,0,0,8]\n\nRow 10: [0,0,0,3,0,0,0,3]\n\nRow 11: [0,0,0,8,0,0,0,8]\n\nFourth input row [3,0,0,0]:\n\nRow 12: [3,0,0,0,3,0,0,0]\n\nRow 13: [8,0,0,0,8,0,0,0]\n\nRow 14: [3,0,0,0,3,0,0,0]\n\nRow 15: [8,0,0,0,8,0,0,0]\n\nBut this would create a 16-row output, which is incorrect. The correct output should be 8 rows. Therefore, each input row produces two output rows, and since there are four input rows, the output has eight rows.\n\nAdjusting the approach: each input row generates two output rows, without repetition. So for four input rows, we get eight output rows.\n\nThus, for the test input:\n\nInput row 0: [0,0,3,0] \u2192 output row 0: [0,0,3,0,0,0,3,0], row1: [0,0,8,0,0,0,8,0]\n\nInput row 1: [0,0,0,0] \u2192 output row2: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0], row3: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nInput row2: [0,0,0,3] \u2192 output row4: [0,0,0,3,0,0,0,3], row5: [0,0,0,8,0,0,0,8]\n\nInput row3: [3,0,0,0] \u2192 output row6: [3,0,0,0,3,0,0,0], row7: [8,0,0,0,8,0,0,0]\n\nSo the output would be:\n\n[0,0,3,0,0,0,3,0]\n\n[0,0,8,0,0,0,8,0]\n\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\n[0,0,0,3,0,0,0,3]\n\n[0,0,0,8,0,0,0,8]\n\n[3,0,0,0,3,0,0,0]\n\n[8,0,0,0,8,0,0,0]\n\nBut looking at Example 1, the output rows have a more complex pattern where non-zero elements are surrounded by 8s not just in their own rows but also in adjacent rows. For instance, in Example 1, the 5s are in the first and seventh positions of the first output row, surrounded by 8s.\n\nSo perhaps the correct pattern is that each input row is duplicated in the output, but with non-zero elements replaced by 8 in the next row. Additionally, the entire matrix is horizontally mirrored, and 8s are inserted between.\n\nBut without a clear pattern, I'll proceed with the assumption that each input row is transformed into two output rows: the original row with elements duplicated, and the same with non-zero elements replaced by 8. Then, for the test input, this gives the following output:\n\nApplying the transformation:\n\nTest Input:\n\nRow 0: [0,0,3,0] \u2192 [0,0,3,3,0,0,0,0] and [0,0,8,8,0,0,0,0]\n\nWait, but how to duplicate each element. If each element is duplicated, then [0,0,3,0] becomes [0,0,0,0,3,3,0,0]. But in Example 2, the duplicated elements are interleaved. So [0,4] becomes [0,4,0,4]. So each element is followed by itself. So for [0,0,3,0], duplicated would be [0,0,0,0,3,3,0,0]. Then the next row would be [0,0,8,8,0,0,0,0].\n\nBut this doesn't match Example 0's output. For example, the first input row of Example 0 is [2,0,0], which becomes [2,0,8,2,0,8]. So it's not just duplicated, but with 8s inserted between.\n\nThis is getting too time-consuming. Given the examples, I'll make a best guess and format the answer accordingly."
