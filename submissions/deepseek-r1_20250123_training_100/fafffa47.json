        "cot_1": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. So, the problem is about transforming an input list of lists into an output list of lists. Let's look at the training examples to find the rule.\n\nFirst, I notice that each example has two groups of three rows each. For instance, in Example 0, the input has six rows divided into two groups: the first three are [0,9,9], [0,9,9], [9,9,9], then the next three are [0,1,0], [0,0,1], [1,1,1]. The output has three rows. So maybe the first three rows are one part and the next three are another, and they combine somehow.\n\nLooking at the outputs, they have 0s, 2s, and sometimes 2s. Let's compare the input rows to the output rows. Let's take Example 0. The first three input rows (let's call them group A) are three rows each with 0s and 9s. The next three (group B) have 0s and 1s. The output is three rows of 0s and 2s. How do these relate?\n\nMaybe for each position in the output, we compare the corresponding positions in group A and group B. Let's look at the first element of the first row in Example 0. Group A's first three rows' first elements are 0,0,9. Group B's first three rows' first elements are 0,0,1. The output is 2. How does 0,0,9 and 0,0,1 become 2?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each cell in the output is determined by some operation between group A and group B. Let's take the first cell of each group. For Example 0's first cell:\n\nGroup A: 0,0,9 (from the first column of each of the first three rows)\nWait, maybe each column of group A and group B is combined. Wait, maybe the output is generated by comparing columns across the two groups. Let's see.\n\nIn Example 0, the output is [2,0,0] in the first row. Let's take each column of group A and group B. For example, the first column in group A (A1) is 0,0,9 (from the first elements of each of the three rows). The first column in group B (B1) is 0,0,1. How do these combine to give 2?\n\nHmm. Another approach: Maybe each element in group A and group B is compared, and the output counts how many times a certain condition is met. For instance, in Example 0's first output cell (2), maybe group A's first column has two 0s and one 9, and group B's first column has two 0s and one 1. But how does that lead to 2?\n\nWait, the numbers in group B are 0s and 1s, and group A has 0s and 9s. The output has 0s and 2s. Let's check if when a certain condition is met in group A and group B, the output is 2. Maybe if in the same position across the three rows of group A and group B, there's a 9 in group A and a 1 in group B, that contributes to the output being 2. Or maybe there's a sum involved.\n\nWait, let's take Example 0's output first row [2,0,0]. Let's look at the first column of group A: 0,0,9. First column of group B: 0,0,1. The output is 2. How? Maybe for each position in the three rows of the group, if group A is 9 and group B is 1, then add 2. But in the third row, group A is 9 and group B is 1. But that's one occurrence. But output is 2. Hmm, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is determined by the sum of elements in group B where the corresponding group A element is 9. For example, in group A's first column, the third element is 9. In group B's first column, the third element is 1. So maybe that's 1. But the output here is 2, so that doesn't add up.\n\nWait another idea: Maybe the output is a count of the number of 9s in group A's column minus the number of 1s in group B's column. For Example 0, first column group A has one 9, group B's first column has one 1. 1 -1 =0, but output is 2. No. Not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is 2 if in the same position across the three rows of group A and B, there's a 9 in group A and a 1 in group B. Let's check.\n\nIn Example 0's output first row first element is 2. Let's look at group A and B's first columns. Group A has 0,0,9. Group B has 0,0,1. So the third position in group A is 9, and in group B it's 1. So that's one occurrence. But output is 2. So maybe it's multiplied by something? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is 2 for each row where in group A the element is 9 and group B's element is 1, summed over the three rows. For example, in group A's first column, third row is 9, group B's third row is 1. That's one occurrence. So 2*1=2. Then output is 2. That matches. Let's check another example.\n\nTake Example 1's output first row: [0,2,0]. Let's look at group A and B's first column. Group A first column is 9,0,0. Group B first column is 1,1,1. So group A has 9 in first row, group B first row is 1. So that's one occurrence. Then the sum would be 2*1=2, but output is 0 here. Wait, that contradicts. So maybe that's not the right approach.\n\nWait, perhaps the output is 2 if the number of 9s in group A's column is equal to the number of 1s in group B's column. Let's check Example 0. Group A's first column has 1 nine. Group B's first column has 1 one. So 1=1, so output 2. But in Example 1, group A's first column has 1 nine, group B's first column has 3 ones (since all three rows in group B's first column are 1). So 1 vs 3. So output is 0. Which matches the first element of Example 1's output (0). Then, the second element of Example 1's output is 2. Let's check group A's second column. Group A: 0,9,0. So number of 9s is 1. Group B's second column: 0,0,0. Number of 1s is 0. 1 vs 0 \u2192 not equal, but output is 2 here. Hmm, that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is 2 for each column where the sum of group A's column (counting 9s as 1 and others as 0) plus the sum of group B's column (counting 1s) equals 2. Let's see. Example 0 first column: group A has 1 (since one 9), group B has 1 (one 1). Total 2. So output 2. That fits. Second column group A has three 9s? Wait, group A's second column in Example 0 is [9,9,9], so three 9s. Group B's second column is [1,0,1]. Number of 1s is 2. So 3 +2=5. But output is 0. So that's not matching. Hmm.\n\nWait maybe the output is 2 if the number of 9s in group A's column is equal to the number of 1s in group B's column. For Example 0, first column: 1 (A) vs 1 (B) \u2192 2. Second column: 3 (A) vs 2 (B) \u2192 not equal. Third column: 3 (A) vs 3 (B) \u2192 3+3=6? Wait group A third column: 9,9,9 \u2192 three 9s. group B third column: 0,1,1 \u2192 two 1s. So 3 vs 2. Not equal. So output is 0. Which matches Example 0's output [2,0,0]. Then first column gets 2, others 0. That seems possible.\n\nIn Example 1's output, the first column of the output is 0. Let's check group A's first column: 9,0,0 \u2192 one 9. group B's first column: 1,1,1 \u2192 three 1s. 1 vs 3 \u2192 not equal. Output 0. Correct. The second column in group A: 0,9,0 \u2192 one 9. group B's second column: 0,0,0 \u2192 zero 1s. 1 vs 0 \u2192 not equal. Output 0. But in the output, the second element in first row is 2. Wait, the output for Example 1 is [0,2,0], [0,0,0], [0,2,0]. Let's check the third column of group A and B. group A third column: 9,9,9 \u2192 three 9s. group B third column: 1,9,9? Wait no, group B is the lower three rows. Let me recheck.\n\nWait in Example 1, the input is:\n\nGroup A:\n[9,0,9]\n[0,9,9]\n[0,0,9]\n\nGroup B:\n[1,0,1]\n[1,0,0]\n[1,0,0]\n\nSo group A columns:\n\nFirst column: 9,0,0 \u2192 one 9.\n\nSecond column: 0,9,0 \u2192 one 9.\n\nThird column:9,9,9 \u2192 three 9s.\n\nGroup B columns:\n\nFirst column:1,1,1 \u2192 three 1s.\n\nSecond column:0,0,0 \u2192 zero 1s.\n\nThird column:1,0,0 \u2192 one 1.\n\nSo for each column in the output, we check if the number of 9s in group A's column equals the number of 1s in group B's column.\n\nFirst column: group A 1, group B 3 \u2192 not equal. Output 0.\n\nSecond column: group A 1, group B 0 \u2192 not equal. Output 0.\n\nThird column: group A 3, group B 1 \u2192 not equal. Output 0.\n\nBut Example 1's output has 2s in the first row's second element and third row's second element. Hmm, maybe my approach is wrong.\n\nAlternatively, maybe for each cell in the output, it's 2 if the sum of the corresponding positions in the three group A rows and three group B rows meet a certain condition. Let's think in terms of each cell in the output grid. For example, the output has three rows and three columns. Let's take the first cell (row 0, column 0) in Example 0's output: 2. How is that determined?\n\nGroup A's first column (column 0) across the three rows: 0,0,9. Group B's column 0: 0,0,1. So the 9 in group A and 1 in group B are in the same row (third row). Maybe each time in the same row and column, if group A is 9 and group B is 1, that contributes to the output. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe for each position in the output grid (i,j), we look at the three rows of group A and group B in column j. For example, for output cell (0,0), it's considering the three elements in column 0 of group A (rows 0,1,2) and column 0 of group B (rows 3,4,5). But how?\n\nWait the output is a 3x3 grid. Maybe each output cell (i,j) is determined by the elements in group A's i-th row and j-th column and group B's i-th row and j-th column. Wait, but group A has three rows and group B also three rows. Let's index them as group A rows 0-2, group B rows 3-5. But the output is three rows. So maybe each output row corresponds to a pair of rows from group A and B.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each output cell (i,j) is the sum of 2 if group A's i-th row, j-th column is 9 and group B's i-th row, j-th column is 1. Let's check Example 0.\n\nGroup A row 0: [0,9,9], group B row 3: [0,1,0]. So for j=0: group A is 0, group B is 0 \u2192 no. j=1: group A 9, group B 1 \u2192 yes. So output row 0, column 1 would be 2. But Example 0's output row 0 is [2,0,0]. Hmm, that doesn't fit. So maybe that's not right.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is generated by looking at all three rows in group A and group B for each column. For example, for each column j in group A and group B, the output cell for row i, column j is 2 if the number of 9s in group A's column j is equal to the number of 1s in group B's column j. Then, perhaps each output row represents a different aspect. Wait, but the output has three rows. Maybe each output row is the same if the condition is met for the column. But in Example 0, output is three rows, first two rows are [2,0,0], then [0,0,0]. That complicates things.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is determined by combining group A and group B in some way. For instance, group A is a 3x3 grid and group B is another 3x3 grid. Maybe the output is a 3x3 grid where each cell is 2 if the corresponding cell in group A is 9 and group B's cell is 1, otherwise 0. But let's check Example 0. In group A, the third row is [9,9,9], group B's third row is [1,1,1]. So all three cells would be 2. But the output's third row is [0,0,0]. So that can't be.\n\nWait, maybe it's the other way around. If group A has a 0 and group B has a 1 in the same position, that's a 2. Or perhaps it's counting how many times across the three rows of group A and group B (so 3 rows each) for each column, the number of 9s in group A and 1s in group B in that column. For example, column j in group A has x 9s, column j in group B has y 1s. Then, if x == y, output is 2 for that column. Let's check Example 0:\n\nGroup A columns:\n\nColumn 0: 0,0,9 \u2192 x=1.\n\nColumn 1:9,9,9 \u2192 x=3.\n\nColumn 2:9,9,9 \u2192 x=3.\n\nGroup B columns:\n\nColumn 0:0,0,1 \u2192 y=1.\n\nColumn 1:1,0,1 \u2192 y=2.\n\nColumn 2:0,1,1 \u2192 y=2.\n\nSo for column 0: x=1, y=1 \u2192 equal \u2192 output 2. So output column 0 is 2. But in Example 0's output, the first row's column 0 is 2, but the other rows in column 0 are also 2. Wait the output is three rows. So how does that fit?\n\nWait Example 0's output is:\n\n[2,0,0]\n\n[2,0,0]\n\n[0,0,0]\n\nSo column 0 has two 2s and one 0. That doesn't align with the idea of column-based checks. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each output row corresponds to a row from group A and a row from group B. For example, output row 0 is derived from group A row 0 and group B row 3. Output row 1 from group A row 1 and group B row 4. Output row 2 from group A row 2 and group B row 5.\n\nIn Example 0, group A row 0: [0,9,9], group B row 3: [0,1,0]. Let's see if combining them gives the output row 0 [2,0,0]. How? For each element in the row, if group A's element is 9 and group B's is 1, then output 2. Otherwise 0. Let's check:\n\nGroup A row 0: 0,9,9.\n\nGroup B row 3: 0,1,0.\n\nFor first element: 0 and 0 \u2192 0. Second: 9 and 1 \u2192 2. Third:9 and 0 \u2192 0. So output [0,2,0]. But Example 0's output row 0 is [2,0,0]. So that's not matching.\n\nHmm. Alternatively, maybe it's the sum of such occurrences across all three pairs. Like for each column, check how many times in the three pairs (group A row 0, group B row3), (group A row1, group B row4), (group A row2, group B row5) the group A cell is 9 and group B cell is 1. Then multiply by 2. Let's see.\n\nTake Example 0's column 0:\n\nGroup A rows 0,1,2: 0,0,9.\n\nGroup B rows 3,4,5:0,0,1.\n\nSo for each pair:\n\n0 & 0 \u2192 no.\n\n0 & 0 \u2192 no.\n\n9 &1 \u2192 yes. So one occurrence. So sum is 1, multiplied by 2 gives 2. So output column 0 is 2. But the output in Example 0 has three rows, each for column 0, but the first two rows have 2 and the third has 0. That doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each output cell corresponds to the number of times in the three pairs (A0,B3), (A1,B4), (A2,B5) where in that cell's position, A has 9 and B has 1, multiplied by 2. For example, for output cell (i,j), it's 2 * count of (A[i][j] ==9 and B[i][j] ==1) across the three pairs.\n\nWait but how are the output rows structured? For example, in Example 0, the output has three rows. Let's index them as output rows 0,1,2. So maybe output row 0 is the sum for j=0 across all three pairs. Or perhaps each output row corresponds to the three pairs' individual results.\n\nWait, maybe the output is a 3x3 grid where each cell (i,j) is 2 if group A's row i and group B's row i+3 have j-th element 9 and 1, respectively. For example, in Example 0's input, group A's row 0 and group B's row3 (0th row of group B) are [0,9,9] and [0,1,0]. So for cell (0,1), group A is 9 and group B is 1 \u2192 2. But the output row0 is [2,0,0], which doesn't match. So that's not.\n\nAnother angle: Let's look at Example 2's output. The input group A is:\n\n[0,9,0]\n\n[9,0,9]\n\n[9,0,0]\n\nGroup B is:\n\n[0,0,0]\n\n[0,0,1]\n\n[1,0,0]\n\nOutput:\n\n[2,0,2]\n\n[0,2,0]\n\n[0,2,2]\n\nLooking at output row0, columns 0 and 2 are 2. Let's see group A's row0: [0,9,0]. group B's row3 (assuming group B starts at row3 of input) is [0,0,0]. So group A has 9 in column1, group B has 0. So why is output row0 column0 and 2 2? This is confusing.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each output cell (i,j) is 2 if, in the three group A rows, the number of 9s in column j is equal to the number of 1s in group B's column j across the three rows. For Example 0, group A column0 has 1 nine, group B column0 has 1 one. So output column0 is 2 in all rows? But output is [2,0,0], etc. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is constructed by comparing the three group A rows with the three group B rows in a specific way. For example, group A rows and group B rows are merged in some fashion.\n\nWait, let's try to find a pattern in the outputs. For Example 0, the output is three rows. Each row has three elements. The first two rows are [2,0,0], and the third is all 0s. How does that relate to the input?\n\nGroup A's rows are:\n\n[0,9,9]\n\n[0,9,9]\n\n[9,9,9]\n\nGroup B's rows are:\n\n[0,1,0]\n\n[0,0,1]\n\n[1,1,1]\n\nThe output's first row is [2,0,0]. Let's think of the group A and B rows as layers. Maybe the output is generated by some operation between the two layers.\n\nWait, another idea: Maybe the output is a count of 2s where in the same position across all three pairs of rows (A0, B3), (A1, B4), (A2, B5), the A cell is 9 and B cell is 1, but summed in a certain way.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for each position in the 3x3 grid, the output is the number of times that position is 9 in group A and 1 in group B, multiplied by 2. For example, for each cell (i,j) in the output, check how many times in the three rows of group A and the three rows of group B that particular cell (i,j) is 9 in group A and 1 in group B. Then multiply by 2.\n\nWait, but group A and B each have three rows. So for example, in Example 0, group A has three rows, group B has three rows. For cell (0,0) in group A: 0,0,9. In group B cell (0,0) for each row: 0,0,1. So in the first row of group A and B, cell (0,0) is 0 and 0 \u2192 no. Second row: 0 and 0 \u2192 no. Third row:9 and1 \u2192 yes. So count is 1. Multiply by 2 gives 2. So output cell (0,0) is 2. But in Example 0's output, the first row of the output is [2,0,0], and the second row is [2,0,0]. So how are those rows generated?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each output row corresponds to each row of group A and group B. For example, output row0 is based on group A row0 and group B row3. If in each cell of those two rows, A has 9 and B has1, then output 2. Otherwise 0.\n\nLet's test this for Example0:\n\nOutput row0 corresponds to group A row0 [0,9,9] and group B row3 [0,1,0].\n\nSo for each cell:\n\n0 and0 \u2192 no \u2192 0.\n\n9 and1 \u2192 yes \u21922.\n\n9 and0 \u2192 no \u21920.\n\nSo output row0 should be [0,2,0]. But in Example0's output, row0 is [2,0,0]. So that doesn't match.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by summing across the three pairs (A0, B3), (A1, B4), (A2, B5). For each cell (i,j), count how many times in the three pairs the A cell is 9 and B cell is 1. Then multiply by 2. Let's try:\n\nFor Example0, cell (0,0) in A0:0, A1:0, A2:9.\n\nCell (0,0) in B3:0, B4:0, B5:1.\n\nSo pairs:\n\nA0, B3: 0,0 \u2192 no.\n\nA1, B4:0,0 \u2192 no.\n\nA2, B5:9,1 \u2192 yes. So count is1. Output 2*1=2.\n\nSimilarly, cell (0,1):\n\nA0:9, A1:9, A2:9.\n\nB3:1, B4:0, B5:1.\n\nPairs:\n\nA0, B3:9,1 \u2192 yes \u2192 count 1.\n\nA1, B4:9,0 \u2192 no.\n\nA2, B5:9,1 \u2192 yes \u2192 count 2.\n\nTotal 2 \u2192 output 4. But output in Example0's cell (0,1) is 0. So that doesn't fit.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Maybe there's another approach. Let's look at the outputs and see if they form any particular patterns. For example, in Example0, the output has two rows of [2,0,0] and one row of zeros. The input's group B has rows that may sum to certain numbers. For instance, group B's rows are [0,1,0], [0,0,1], [1,1,1]. The sum of 1s in each column: column0: 0+0+1=1, column1:1+0+1=2, column2:0+1+1=2. But how does that relate to the output?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is determined by the sum of group B's columns where group A's columns have 9s. For example, group A's column0 has 0,0,9 \u2192 sum of 9s is1. Group B's column0 sum of 1s is1. So output for that column is 2. That matches Example0's first column in output. Similarly, group A's column1 has 9,9,9 \u2192 sum of 9s is3. group B's column1 sum is 2. So 3 vs 2 \u2192 no, so output 0. Third column group A sum 3, group B sum 2 \u2192 output 0. So each column in output is 2 if the number of 9s in group A's column equals the number of 1s in group B's column. Then, how is this mapped to the output grid? The output is three rows, so perhaps each row in the output represents that column condition for a different combination of rows. Or maybe the output's rows are each a separate calculation based on the group A and B rows.\n\nBut in Example0's output, all columns in the first two rows are [2,0,0], which suggests that the first two rows are the same. Maybe the output rows are determined by some other condition.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is a 3x3 grid where each cell (i,j) is 2 if the sum of group A's j-th column 9s equals the sum of group B's j-th column 1s and this occurs exactly i+1 times. But I'm not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps the output is a 3x3 grid where each row represents a different comparison between group A and group B. For example, the first output row checks if the first row of group A has 9s and the first row of group B has 1s in the same positions. But this doesn't fit.\n\nAnother approach: Let's think of group A and B as two 3x3 matrices. The output is another 3x3 matrix where each element is 2 if the corresponding elements in group A and B meet a certain condition. But what condition?\n\nLooking at Example0's output:\n\nGroup A's rows:\n\n[0,9,9]\n\n[0,9,9]\n\n[9,9,9]\n\nGroup B's rows:\n\n[0,1,0]\n\n[0,0,1]\n\n[1,1,1]\n\nOutput:\n\n[2,0,0]\n\n[2,0,0]\n\n[0,0,0]\n\nLooking at the first output row [2,0,0], perhaps it's related to the sum of group A's first column (0,0,9 \u2192 9s count 1) and group B's first column (0,0,1 \u2192 1s count1). 1=1 \u2192 output 2. So the first column of the output is 2. But why are the first two rows 2 and the third 0?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output's rows correspond to the rows in group A and B. For example, for each row in group A and group B, if the sum of 9s in group A's row equals the sum of 1s in group B's row, then output 2 in that row's first position. But this doesn't seem to fit.\n\nFor Example0, group A's row0 sum of 9s is 2. Group B's row3 sum of 1s is 1. 2\u22601 \u2192 no. Output row0 first element is 2. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAnother idea: Let's look at the sum of all 9s in group A and all 1s in group B. For Example0, group A has 0+0+9 (first column) \u2192 1 nine, but other columns have more. Total 9s: first column 1, second column 3, third column 3 \u2192 total 7. Group B's 1s: first column 1, second column 2, third column 2 \u2192 total 5. 7 vs 5. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the output could be generated by checking, for each cell, if the corresponding cell in group A is 9 and in group B is 1. If so, output 2. Otherwise 0. But how does that work when group A and B have multiple rows?\n\nWait, maybe each cell in the output is 2 if there's at least one occurrence in group A's three rows and group B's three rows for that column where group A has a 9 and group B has a 1. Let's see.\n\nExample0's first column: group A has 9 in the third row. group B's first column has 1 in the third row. So yes. So output column 0 is 2. But how is that mapped to the rows in the output? The output's first two rows have 2 in column0. Perhaps the output's rows are the same for each column, but that's not the case.\n\nThis is getting really tricky. Let's try to find another pattern. Looking at Example0's output, the first two rows are [2,0,0], and the third is zeros. Maybe the output is a result of some vertical or horizontal stacking. Or perhaps the output is the sum of certain combinations.\n\nWait, maybe the output is the sum of group A's columns and group B's columns, but with certain transformations. For example, group A's columns are summed for 9s (each 9 is 1), group B's columns are summed for 1s, then multiplied by 2 if equal.\n\nExample0's first column: group A sum 1, group B sum 1 \u2192 2. So output column 0 is 2. Second column: group A sum3, group B sum2 \u2192 no. Third column: group A sum3, group B sum2 \u2192 no. So output is [2,0,0] for each row? But why three rows?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each row in the output corresponds to a pair of rows from group A and group B. For example, the first output row is for group A row0 and group B row3, the second output row for group A row1 and group B row4, third for group A row2 and group B row5. Then, for each cell in these pairs, if group A has 9 and group B has 1, output is 2, else 0. Let's test this for Example0:\n\nGroup A row0: [0,9,9]\n\nGroup B row3: [0,1,0]\n\nOutput row0 would be [0,2,0]. But the actual output is [2,0,0]. So that's not matching.\n\nHmm. Maybe there's a different pairing. Perhaps group A row0 with group B row4, group A row1 with group B row5, group A row2 with group B row3. Or some other combination. But I don't see a pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is a 3x3 matrix where each cell (i,j) is 2 if the sum of group A's j-th column equals the sum of group B's j-th column. For Example0, j=0: sum of group A's j=0 is 1 (number of 9s), group B's j=0 is 1 (number of 1s). So output 2. j=1: group A sum3, group B sum2 \u2192 no. j=2: group A sum3, group B sum2 \u2192 no. So output columns are [2,0,0]. But how does that become three rows of [2,0,0], [2,0,0], [0,0,0]. Maybe the rows are repeated based on some other condition.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each row in the output corresponds to how many times the column's condition is met across the three pairs of rows. For example, in Example0's first column, the condition (group A 9 and group B 1) is met once (third row). So output 2 in some way. But how does that spread across three rows.\n\nThis is really challenging. Let's try to look for another pattern. Let's take Example2's input and output:\n\nInput:\n\nGroup A:\n\n[0,9,0]\n\n[9,0,9]\n\n[9,0,0]\n\nGroup B:\n\n[0,0,0]\n\n[0,0,1]\n\n[1,0,0]\n\nOutput:\n\n[2,0,2]\n\n[0,2,0]\n\n[0,2,2]\n\nLooking at group A's columns:\n\nColumn0: 0,9,9 \u2192 two 9s.\n\nColumn1:9,0,0 \u2192 one 9.\n\nColumn2:0,9,0 \u2192 one 9.\n\nGroup B's columns:\n\nColumn0:0,0,1 \u2192 one 1.\n\nColumn1:0,0,0 \u2192 zero 1s.\n\nColumn2:0,1,0 \u2192 one 1.\n\nSo for column0: group A has two 9s, group B has one 1. So 2 vs 1 \u2192 no. Column1:1 vs0 \u2192 no. Column2:1 vs1 \u2192 yes. So output column2 should be 2. But the output's first row has 2 in column0 and 2. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is constructed by looking at each pair of rows in group A and group B. For example, for each of the three pairs (A0,B3), (A1,B4), (A2,B5), we create a row in the output where each cell is 2 if A's cell is 9 and B's cell is 1, else 0. Then, the output is the sum of these three rows, multiplied by 2. But let's check Example0:\n\nPair (A0, B3):\n\n[0,9,9] vs [0,1,0] \u2192 cells where 9 and 1: only middle \u2192 [0,2,0].\n\nPair (A1, B4):\n\n[0,9,9] vs [0,0,1] \u2192 only third cell \u2192 [0,0,2].\n\nPair (A2, B5):\n\n[9,9,9] vs [1,1,1] \u2192 all cells \u2192 [2,2,2].\n\nSum these three:\n\n[0+0+2, 2+0+2, 0+2+2] = [2,4,4]. Multiply by 2 \u2192 [4,8,8]. Which doesn't match the output. So that's not.\n\nAnother angle: The outputs often have 2s in positions where group A has 9s and group B has 1s in some way. Maybe the output is 2 in cells where, across the three rows of group A and B, there's an odd number of times that 9 and 1 appear in that position.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's a bitwise operation, but with 9 and 1 being treated as binary flags. But 9 is 1001 in binary, which complicates things.\n\nAlternatively, think of 9 and 1 as representing something. Maybe in group A, 9 represents a cell that's \"active\" and in group B, 1 represents a cell that's \"active\". The output is 2 if there's a certain combination of active cells.\n\nAlternatively, the output could be the sum of group B's columns where the corresponding group A column has a 9, but multiplied by 2. For example, in Example0's column0: group B's sum of 1s is1, multiplied by 2 gives 2. So output column0 is 2. This would fit Example0's first column. But how does this translate to the output rows? The output rows would all have the same value for each column. Like Example0's output has three rows, first two rows have [2,0,0], and third is zeros. That suggests that the output rows are not all the same.\n\nThis is really perplexing. Let me try to find a pattern in the outputs.\n\nLooking at the outputs:\n\nExample0:\n\nOutput rows:\n\n[2,0,0]\n\n[2,0,0]\n\n[0,0,0]\n\nExample1:\n\n[0,2,0]\n\n[0,0,0]\n\n[0,2,0]\n\nExample2:\n\n[2,0,2]\n\n[0,2,0]\n\n[0,2,2]\n\nExample3:\n\n[0,2,0]\n\n[0,0,0]\n\n[2,0,0]\n\nExample4:\n\n[2,0,2]\n\n[0,0,0]\n\n[0,0,0]\n\nNoticing that the output rows often have 2s in positions where certain conditions are met. For instance, in Example0, the first two rows have 2 in the first position. In Example1, the first and third rows have 2 in the middle position.\n\nMaybe the output is generated by looking at the parity (even or odd) of the number of 9s in group A's columns and 1s in group B's columns. For example, if the count is even, output 0; if odd, output 2. But let's check Example0's column0: count of 9s is1 (odd), count of 1s is1 (odd). Output 2. Column1:9s count3 (odd), 1s count2 (even). Output0. Column2:9s count3 (odd), 1s count2 (even). Output0. So that fits. But how does that generate the rows?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each row in the output corresponds to a different combination of group A and group B rows. For example, row0 of the output checks group A row0 and group B row3 for a certain condition, row1 checks group A row1 and group B row4, and row2 checks group A row2 and group B row5. But what condition?\n\nIn Example0's row0 of output: [2,0,0]. Group A row0: [0,9,9], group B row3: [0,1,0]. The first element of output is 2, which would correspond to group A and B's first elements (0 and 0 \u2192 no). Hmm, not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each output cell is 2 if in group A's column j, the number of 9s is equal to the number of 1s in group B's column j, and the output cell's row corresponds to the row in group A where the 9s are present. But I'm not sure.\n\nAnother idea: Maybe the output is a 3x3 grid where each cell (i,j) is 2 if the sum of group A's row i and group B's row (i+3) in column j equals 10 (9+1). Let's check Example0:\n\nGroup A row0:0,9,9.\n\nGroup B row3:0,1,0.\n\nSum for each cell:\n\n0+0=0 \u2192 no.\n\n9+1=10 \u2192 yes.\n\n9+0=9 \u2192 no.\n\nSo output row0 would be [0,2,0]. But actual output is [2,0,0]. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, if the cell in group A is 9 and group B is 1, then output 2. Otherwise 0. But how? For Example0's row0, it's [0,9,9] and group B row3 [0,1,0]. So only the second cell would be 2. But output is [2,0,0]. So that's not matching.\n\nThis is really challenging. Let me try to think of another approach. Maybe the output is a result of XOR-like operation between group A and group B, but with specific values. For example, group A cell is 9 and group B is 1 \u2192 2, else 0. But how to explain Example0's output.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the count of 9s in group A's columns multiplied by the count of 1s in group B's columns, then modulo 3 or something. For Example0's column0: 1*1=1 \u2192 2? Not sure.\n\nAnother observation: The outputs often have 2s in positions that seem to form some symmetry. For example, Example0's output has two rows with 2s in the first position. Example1's output has 2s in the middle of the first and third rows. Maybe the output is based on some kind of diagonal or vertical/horizontal pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by comparing group A and group B in a way that mirrors their structure. For example, group A's rows are overlaid with group B's rows in reverse order, and the output is formed where certain conditions are met. But I'm not sure.\n\nAt this point, I'm stuck. Let's try to look for a pattern in the test input and see if that can help.\n\nTest Input:\n\nGroup A:\n\n[9,0,9]\n\n[0,0,9]\n\n[9,0,9]\n\nGroup B:\n\n[0,1,1]\n\n[0,1,0]\n\n[1,0,0]\n\nGroup A's columns:\n\nColumn0:9,0,9 \u2192 two 9s.\n\nColumn1:0,0,0 \u2192 zero 9s.\n\nColumn2:9,9,9 \u2192 three 9s.\n\nGroup B's columns:\n\nColumn0:0,0,1 \u2192 one 1.\n\nColumn1:1,1,0 \u2192 two 1s.\n\nColumn2:1,0,0 \u2192 one 1.\n\nSo for each column:\n\nColumn0: group A 2, group B 1 \u2192 2 vs1 \u2192 not equal \u2192 output 0.\n\nColumn1:0 vs2 \u2192 no \u2192 0.\n\nColumn2:3 vs1 \u2192 no \u21920.\n\nBut according to the previous idea where output is 2 if counts are equal, the output columns would be all 0. But that's unlikely given the examples. So perhaps that's not the pattern.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is 2 for columns where the sum of group A's 9s is even. Column0:2 (even), column1:0 (even), column2:3 (odd). So output 2 for columns 0 and 1. But how to map this into rows.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is 2 in cells where the sum of group A's column j is even. So column0:2 \u2192 even \u2192 2. Column1:0 \u2192 even \u2192 2. Column2:3 \u2192 odd \u21920. So output would be 2 in columns 0 and 1. But how to distribute that into three rows.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each row of the output corresponds to the number of 9s in group A's rows. For example, group A's row0 has two 9s (even \u2192 2), row1 has one 9 (odd \u21920?), row2 has three 9s (odd \u21920). But the output in Example0 has two rows with 2 and one with 0. So row0 and row1 of group A have 2 and 2 9s. Maybe even number of 9s in a row leads to output row having 2 in certain positions. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the output could be a matrix where each cell is 2 if the corresponding group A cell is 9 and the group B cell in the same position (after some transformation) is 1. But the problem is that group A and group B each have three rows, and the output has three rows. So perhaps the output is the sum of group A and group B, but with 9+1=10 \u2192 0 (mod something), but this doesn't fit.\n\nWait, perhaps the output is the sum of group A and group B for each cell, where 9 is treated as 1 and other numbers as 0. For example, if group A's cell is 9, add 1. If group B's cell is 1, add 1. So sum is 0,1, or 2. Then multiply by 2. Let's test this.\n\nFor Example0's group A row0:0,9,9 \u2192 0,1,1.\n\nGroup B row3:0,1,0 \u21920,1,0.\n\nSum:0+0=0, 1+1=2, 1+0=1 \u2192 [0,2,1]. Multiply by 2 \u2192 [0,4,2]. But the output is [2,0,0]. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAnother idea: Maybe the output is determined by the sum of group A's column j and group B's column j. For example, group A's column j has x 9s, group B's column j has y 1s. If x + y is even, output 0; if odd, output 2. Let's check Example0:\n\nColumn0:1+1=2 \u2192 even \u21920. But output is 2. So that's not.\n\nAlternatively, if x == y, output 2. Which would fit Example0's column0. But column1:3+2=5 \u2192 no. Column2:3+2=5 \u2192 no. So output column0 is 2, others 0. Which matches Example0's output columns. But how does this translate to the output rows? For example0, the output rows are [2,0,0], [2,0,0], [0,0,0]. So why are the first two rows 2 and the third 0?\n\nPerhaps the output rows are determined by how many times in each row of group A there are 9s that align with 1s in group B's rows. For example, each output row i is 2 if group A row i has a 9 in column j and group B row i+3 has a 1 in column j. Let's test this for the test input.\n\nTest input group A rows:\n\nRow0:9,0,9\n\nRow1:0,0,9\n\nRow2:9,0,9\n\nGroup B rows:\n\nRow3:0,1,1\n\nRow4:0,1,0\n\nRow5:1,0,0\n\nOutput row0 would be group A row0 and group B row3:\n\n9 and0 \u2192 no.\n\n0 and1 \u2192 no.\n\n9 and1 \u2192 yes. So output row0 would be [0,0,2].\n\nOutput row1: group A row1 and group B row4:\n\n0 and0 \u2192 no.\n\n0 and1 \u2192 no.\n\n9 and0 \u2192 no. So output row1 [0,0,0].\n\nOutput row2: group A row2 and group B row5:\n\n9 and1 \u2192 yes.\n\n0 and0 \u2192 no.\n\n9 and0 \u2192 no. So output row2 [2,0,0].\n\nSo the output would be:\n\n[0,0,2]\n\n[0,0,0]\n\n[2,0,0]\n\nBut looking at the training examples, this doesn't match any of their patterns. For example, Example1's output has [0,2,0] in row0 and row2. So perhaps this approach is not correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by combining all three pairs. For each cell (i,j), count the number of times group A's row i has a 9 and group B's row i+3 has a 1, then multiply by 2. For test input:\n\nCell (0,0): group A row0 has9, group B row3 has0 \u2192 no.\n\nCell (0,1): group A 0, group B1 \u2192 no.\n\nCell (0,2):9 and1 \u2192 yes. So count1 \u2192 2.\n\nCell (1,0): group A row1 0, group B row4 0 \u2192 no.\n\nCell (1,1):0 and1 \u2192 no.\n\nCell (1,2):9 and0 \u2192 no.\n\nCell (2,0):9 and1 \u2192 yes.\n\nCell (2,1):0 and0 \u2192 no.\n\nCell (2,2):9 and0 \u2192 no.\n\nSo the output would be:\n\n[0,0,2]\n\n[0,0,0]\n\n[2,0,0]\n\nBut none of the training examples have this structure. For example, Example1's output has two 2s in different positions.\n\nI'm really stuck here. Maybe I need to look for a different pattern.\n\nAnother observation: The output grids in the examples often have 2s in positions that form a certain pattern. For example, Example0's output has two rows with 2s in the first column. Example2's output has a diagonal of 2s.\n\nAlternatively, the output could be a result of some bitwise operation between the group A and B values, but mapped in a specific way. For example, 9 in binary is 1001, and 1 is 0001. Maybe XOR or AND operations. But 9 AND 1 is 1, which doesn't explain the 2 in output.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the sum of group A and group B for each cell, but with 9+1=10, which is then mod 8 to get 2. So 10 mod 8 = 2. So any cell where group A is9 and group B is1 would sum to 10, mod 8 gives 2. For example, in Example0, group A row2 column0 is9 and group B row5 column0 is1. So 9+1=10 mod8=2. But how does this apply to other cells. For cells where group A is not 9 or group B is not 1, the sum would be different. But in the output, those cells are 0. So perhaps the output is 2 if the sum is 10, else 0. \n\nBut this would require that group A and group B's corresponding cells sum to 10. For example, group A's cell is9 and group B's is1. So output is2. Let's check this with Example0's group A row0 and group B row3.\n\nGroup A row0:0,9,9.\n\nGroup B row3:0,1,0.\n\nSum:0+0=0 \u2192 0.\n\n9+1=10 \u21922.\n\n9+0=9 \u21920.\n\nSo output row0 would be [0,2,0]. But Example0's output row0 is [2,0,0]. So this doesn't fit.\n\nBut wait, maybe it's not row-wise. Maybe it's column-wise. For each cell in the output, if any pair of group A and group B cells in the same column sum to 10, then output 2.\n\nFor Example0's column0:\n\nGroup A cells:0,0,9.\n\nGroup B cells:0,0,1.\n\nOnly the third row sums to10 (9+1). So output column0 is 2. But how to represent this in the output's rows. Perhaps each column's output is 2 if any cell in that column sums to10, and then the output's rows are somehow mapped based on that. But this doesn't explain the three rows.\n\nAnother possible clue: The output grids have 0s and 2s, no other numbers. So the transformation likely involves a binary condition (either 0 or 2) based on some criteria.\n\nAnother angle: Let's consider the positions where group A has 9 and group B has 1, but across all three pairs of rows. For example, in the test input:\n\nGroup A's column0 has 9s in row0 and row2. Group B's column0 has1 in row5. So for row0 and row5, 9 and1 are in different rows, so no overlap. For row2 of group A (9) and row5 of group B (1) in column0: same row in their respective groups. But how this translates to the output.\n\nAlternatively, for each column j, the output cell (i,j) is 2 if group A's row i has 9 and group B's row i+3 has 1 in column j. Let's test this for Example0:\n\nExample0's group A row0:0,9,9.\n\nGroup B row3:0,1,0.\n\nSo output row0:0 (no 9 and1 in column0), 2 (9 and1 in column1), 0 (9 and0 in column2) \u2192 [0,2,0]. But Example0's output row0 is [2,0,0]. Doesn't fit.\n\nBut wait, maybe the output cell (i,j) is 2 if group A's row i has 9 in column j and group B's row i has 1 in column j. But group B's row i would be group B's rows 0-2, but in the input, group B's rows are rows3-5. So perhaps group B's rows are considered as their own.\n\nAlternatively, maybe group A's row i and group B's row i (for i=0,1,2) are compared. So group A rows 0-2 and group B rows 0-2 (input rows3-5). For each cell (i,j), if group A's cell (i,j) is9 and group B's cell (i,j) is1, then output 2. Otherwise 0.\n\nLet's test this for Example0:\n\nGroup A rows0-2:\n\n[0,9,9]\n\n[0,9,9]\n\n[9,9,9]\n\nGroup B rows3-5:\n\n[0,1,0]\n\n[0,0,1]\n\n[1,1,1]\n\nCompare cell (0,0): 0 and0 \u2192 no.\n\nCell (0,1):9 and1 \u2192 yes \u21922.\n\nCell (0,2):9 and0 \u2192 no.\n\nSo output row0: [0,2,0].\n\nCell (1,0):0 and0 \u2192 no.\n\nCell (1,1):9 and0 \u2192 no.\n\nCell (1,2):9 and1 \u2192 yes \u21922.\n\nOutput row1: [0,0,2].\n\nCell (2,0):9 and1 \u2192 yes \u21922.\n\nCell (2,1):9 and1 \u2192 yes \u21922.\n\nCell (2,2):9 and1 \u2192 yes \u21922.\n\nOutput row2: [2,2,2].\n\nBut Example0's output is:\n\n[2,0,0]\n\n[2,0,0]\n\n[0,0,0]\n\nSo this doesn't match. So this approach is incorrect.\n\nAt this point, I'm really stuck and might need to make an educated guess based on the examples.\n\nLooking at the test input's group A and group B:\n\nGroup A columns:\n\n0:9,0,9 \u2192 two 9s.\n\n1:0,0,0 \u2192 zero 9s.\n\n2:9,9,9 \u2192 three 9s.\n\nGroup B columns:\n\n0:0,0,1 \u2192 one 1.\n\n1:1,1,0 \u2192 two 1s.\n\n2:1,0,0 \u2192 one 1.\n\nIf the output is 2 where the number of 9s in group A's column equals the number of 1s in group B's column:\n\nColumn0: 2 vs1 \u2192 no.\n\nColumn1:0 vs2 \u2192 no.\n\nColumn2:3 vs1 \u2192 no.\n\nSo all columns would output 0. But this doesn't make sense, as none of the examples have all zeros.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is 2 if the sum of group A's 9s and group B's 1s in a column is even. Column0:2+1=3 (odd) \u2192 0. Column1:0+2=2 (even) \u21922. Column2:3+1=4 (even) \u21922. So columns1 and2 have 2. But how to arrange this into three rows.\n\nLooking at Example2's output, which has 2s in columns where the sums are even or odd. For example, column0 sum 2 9s and group B column0 sum0 1s \u2192 2+0=2 (even) \u2192 output 2. But Example2's column0 output is 2. So maybe this is the case. But then for the test input, column1 and column2 would be even sums. So output would have 2s in those columns.\n\nBut how to form the rows. Maybe each row in the output is the same, reflecting the column sums. But Example0's output has different rows. This is confusing.\n\nGiven the time I've spent without success, I'll make a guess based on the test input. Let's consider that for each column, if the number of 9s in group A's column is equal to the number of 1s in group B's column, then output 2 in all rows for that column. Otherwise 0. But for the test input, no columns meet this condition. So output would be all zeros. But that's unlikely given the examples.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for each column, if the number of 9s in group A's column is greater than or equal to the number of 1s in group B's column, output 2 in the corresponding rows. For the test input:\n\nColumn0:2 >=1 \u2192 yes. So output column0 is 2 in some rows.\n\nColumn1:0 >=2 \u2192 no.\n\nColumn2:3 >=1 \u2192 yes. Output column2 is 2.\n\nBut how to distribute this into rows. Maybe each row has 2 in columns where the condition is met. But then the output would have 2s in columns0 and2. Looking at Example0's output, the first two rows have 2 in column0. \n\nAlternatively, the output is a 3x3 grid where each column has 2s if the condition is met, and the number of 2s in each column equals the number of 9s in group A's column. For example, in Example0's column0, group A has1 9 \u2192 output column0 has two 2s. But why two?\n\nThis is getting me nowhere. Given that I'm stuck, I'll take a guess based on the test input and the examples.\n\nLooking at the test input's group A and B:\n\nGroup A rows:\n\n[9,0,9]\n\n[0,0,9]\n\n[9,0,9]\n\nGroup B rows:\n\n[0,1,1]\n\n[0,1,0]\n\n[1,0,0]\n\nIf we pair each group A row with group B row (row0 with row3, row1 with row4, row2 with row5), and check for 9 and1 in the same cell:\n\nPair0: (9,0,9) vs (0,1,1) \u2192 cells (0,1) 0 vs1 (group A is0, so no), (0,2)9 vs1 \u2192 yes. So output row0: [0,0,2].\n\nPair1: (0,0,9) vs (0,1,0) \u2192 cell (2,2)9 vs0 \u2192 no. So output row1: [0,0,0].\n\nPair2: (9,0,9) vs (1,0,0) \u2192 cell (0,0)9 vs1 \u2192 yes. So output row2: [2,0,0].\n\nBut this gives an output of:\n\n[0,0,2]\n\n[0,0,0]\n\n[2,0,0]\n\nBut looking at the examples, this doesn't match their structure. However, perhaps the output is the sum of these three rows, multiplied by 2. Sum would be [2,0,2]. Multiplied by 2 gives [4,0,4], which doesn't fit the output format of 0s and 2s.\n\nAlternatively, the output is the maximum of these three rows. So the output would be [2,0,2], but that doesn't match any example.\n\nGiven that I'm unable to find a consistent pattern, I'll take a wild guess based on Example1's output. Example1's input group A has 9s in certain positions and group B has 1s in others. The output has 2s where columns have matching counts. But I'm not sure.\n\nFor the test input, group A's columns:\n\n0: two 9s.\n\n1: zero 9s.\n\n2: three 9s.\n\n group B's columns:\n\n0: one 1.\n\n1: two 1s.\n\n2: one 1.\n\nSo, the number of 9s in group A's columns are 2,0,3.\n\nNumber of 1s in group B's columns are 1,2,1.\n\nSo, for column0: 2 vs1 \u2192 no.\n\ncolumn1:0 vs2 \u2192 no.\n\ncolumn2:3 vs1 \u2192 no.\n\nBut perhaps the output is 2 for each column where group A's 9 count is exactly twice group B's 1 count. For example, column0: 2 is twice 1 \u2192 yes. So output column0 is 2. column1:0 is twice 0 \u2192 yes. So output column1 is 2. column2:3 is not twice 1. So output column2 is0. But then how to arrange into three rows. Maybe the output has 2s in the first row for column0 and column1.\n\nBut this is just a guess. Given the time I've spent and the lack of progress, I'll proceed with this pattern and see if it fits the test input.\n\nAssuming that the output is 2 for columns where group A's 9 count equals group B's 1 count. Test input has none. So output would be all zeros. But this contradicts the examples.\n\nAnother final guess: The output is generated by checking for each cell (i,j) across all three pairs of group A and B rows. If in any of those pairs, group A has 9 and group B has 1 in that cell, then output 2. Otherwise 0. For the test input:\n\nFor cell (0,0): group A row0 has9, group B row3 has0 \u2192 no. group A row0 and group B row4 has0. group A row0 and group B row5 has1. So no.\n\nBut for cell (0,0), group A row0 has9 and group B row5 has1. But these are different rows. So perhaps not.\n\nAlternatively, if any pair (A row, B row) has 9 and 1 in the same cell, output 2. For example, cell (0,2) in group A row0 and group B row3 has9 and1 \u2192 yes. So output cell (0,2) is2. Similarly, cell (2,0) in group A row2 and group B row5 has9 and1 \u2192 yes. So output cell (2,0) is2. Other cells may not have such pairs.\n\nSo the output would be:\n\n[0,0,2]\n\n[0,0,0]\n\n[2,0,0]\n\nBut this doesn't match any of the example patterns. However, looking back at Example1's output, it has 2s in the middle of the first and third rows, which could be due to such a condition.\n\nGiven the time I've spent, I'll proceed with this approach and predict the output as:\n\n[0,0,2]\n\n[0,0,0]\n\n[2,0,0]\n\nBut formatting according to the training examples, each row is enclosed in brackets and separated by newlines. So the final answer would be:\n\n[0, 0, 2]\n\n[0, 0, 0]\n\n[2, 0, 0]\n\nBut I'm not confident. Looking at the training examples, sometimes the output has multiple 2s in a column. For example, Example2's output has [2,0,2] in the first row, which may correspond to two different pairs. But without a clear pattern, this is a guess.",

        "cot_2": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. So, the input consists of two sets of three rows each. The first three rows are numbers (like 0,9, etc.), then there's another three rows, probably another matrix. The output is a 3x3 matrix with 0s and 2s.\n\nLooking at the examples. Let's take example 0. The input is:\n\nFirst three rows:\n[0,9,9]\n[0,9,9]\n[9,9,9]\n\nThen the next three rows:\n[0,1,0]\n[0,0,1]\n[1,1,1]\n\nOutput:\n[2,0,0]\n[2,0,0]\n[0,0,0]\n\nHmm. Maybe the first three rows and the next three rows are two separate 3x3 matrices. Let's call the first matrix A and the second matrix B. The output is another matrix C. How do A and B combine to form C?\n\nLooking at the positions. Let's take the first element of the output in example 0. It's 2. In matrix A's first row first element is 0. Matrix B's first row first element is 0. But how does that lead to 2?\n\nWait, maybe it's some kind of comparison between the two matrices. For example, if in a certain position, matrix A has a 9 and matrix B has a 1, then output is 2. Or something like that.\n\nLet me check another example. Example 1's input:\n\nMatrix A:\n[9,0,9]\n[0,9,9]\n[0,0,9]\n\nMatrix B:\n[1,0,1]\n[1,0,0]\n[1,0,0]\n\nOutput:\n[0,2,0]\n[0,0,0]\n[0,2,0]\n\nLooking at output positions with 2. The first row's second element is 2. In matrix A, that position is 0. In matrix B, that position is 0. Wait, maybe not. Let me check:\n\nWait, output's first row is [0,2,0]. So the second element (index 1) is 2. In matrix A's first row is [9,0,9], so position (0,1) is 0. In matrix B's first row is [1,0,1], position (0,1) is 0. So why is the output 2 here?\n\nAlternatively, maybe when the sum of the corresponding elements in A and B meets a certain condition. Like A's element plus B's element equals 9 + 1 = 10? But 0+0=0 in that position. Hmm.\n\nWait, another idea: maybe each output cell is determined by looking at the corresponding cells in A and B. If in matrix A, the cell is 9 and in matrix B, the cell is 1, then output is 2. Otherwise, 0. But let's check.\n\nIn example 0's output, the first row first element is 2. Matrix A's (0,0) is 0, matrix B's (0,0) is 0. That doesn't fit. So that's not it.\n\nWait, maybe the output is 2 where matrix B has a 1 and matrix A has a 9. Let's check example 0. The output first row first element is 2. Matrix A (0,0) is 0, matrix B (0,0) is 0. So no. Not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is 2 where matrix A is 0 and matrix B is 1. Let's see example 0's output first row first element is 2. Matrix A (0,0) is 0, matrix B (0,0) is 0. No. So that's not.\n\nWait, maybe it's the other way around. If matrix A's cell is 9 and matrix B's cell is 1, then output 2. Otherwise 0. Let's check.\n\nIn example 0, the output first row is [2,0,0]. Let's check matrix A first row: [0,9,9]. Matrix B first row: [0,1,0]. So for the first element, matrix A is 0, B is 0. That's not 9 and 1. Second element A is 9, B is 1. So output 2. But in the output, the second element is 0. Wait, that contradicts. So maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is 2 when the sum of A and B cells is 10 (9+1). Let's check example 0. Let's look for positions where A is 9 and B is 1. For example, in matrix A first row, the second and third elements are 9 and 9. Matrix B's first row has 1 in the second position. So A's (0,1) is 9, B's (0,1) is 1. Sum is 10, so output is 2. But in example 0's output, the first row is [2,0,0]. So (0,0) is 2. Wait, maybe sum is 0 + 0? Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps it's the other way around. Let's take example 1's output [0,2,0] in first row. The second element is 2. Matrix A's (0,1) is 0, matrix B's (0,1) is 0. So sum 0. Hmm. That's not 10.\n\nAlternative approach: look at the output's 2s and see their positions in both matrices.\n\nTake example 0's output: two 2s in the first column. The output first two rows have 2 in the first position. The third row has all zeros. Let's see matrix A and B for those positions.\n\nFor the first column in output:\n\nRow 0: 2. Matrix A's (0,0) is 0, matrix B's (0,0) is 0.\n\nRow 1: 2. Matrix A's (1,0) is 0, matrix B's (1,0) is 0.\n\nHmm. That doesn't help. So maybe the 2s are not directly based on the values in the same cell of A and B.\n\nAlternative idea: perhaps the output is determined by some operation between the two matrices. For example, the difference between A and B. Let's see. For example, if A is 9 and B is 0, then output 2. But example 0's first row first element is 0 in A and 0 in B. Output is 2. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's a count of the number of 9s in matrix A in some pattern, modified by matrix B. Not sure.\n\nAnother angle: look at the test input and see if possible patterns emerge. Test input is:\n\nMatrix A (first three rows):\n[9,0,9]\n[0,0,9]\n[9,0,9]\n\nMatrix B (next three rows):\n[0,1,1]\n[0,1,0]\n[1,0,0]\n\nSo need to find output based on these. Let's see.\n\nBut perhaps the key is to look at the positions where B has 1 and A has 9. Let's check. For the test input, matrix A has 9s in positions (0,0), (0,2), (1,2), (2,0), (2,2). Matrix B has 1s in (0,1), (0,2), (1,1), (2,0). So overlapping where A is 9 and B is 1 would be:\n\nA's (0,2) is 9, B's (0,2) is 1 \u2192 yes.\n\nA's (2,0) is 9, B's (2,0) is 1 \u2192 yes.\n\nSo maybe those positions would be 2. But let's see what the output would look like. So in positions (0,2) and (2,0), output is 2. But the output is a 3x3 matrix. Let's see if that's the case in previous examples.\n\nLooking at example 1's output. Output has 2s in (0,1) and (2,1). Let's check matrix B for those positions. Matrix B's (0,1) is 0, (2,1) is 0. Hmm, that's conflicting. So maybe that's not the rule.\n\nAlternative approach: Maybe the output is based on the sum of the columns in matrix A and matrix B. For example, sum columns of A and B and then apply some operation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is constructed by comparing the two matrices in some way. Like, for each cell, if the corresponding cell in B is 1 and the cell above or below in A is 9, then output 2. But that seems complicated.\n\nWait, let's look at example 2:\n\nInput matrix A:\n[0,9,0]\n[9,0,9]\n[9,0,0]\n\nMatrix B:\n[0,0,0]\n[0,0,1]\n[1,0,0]\n\nOutput:\n[2,0,2]\n[0,2,0]\n[0,2,2]\n\nLooking at output, (0,0) is 2. Matrix A (0,0) is 0, B (0,0) is 0. So not sure. How about (0,2) in output is 2. Matrix A (0,2) is 0, B (0,2) is 0. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output counts the number of 9s in matrix A in the same row and column as each position, but only where matrix B has a 1. For example, for each cell in the output, if matrix B has a 1 in that cell, then count the number of 9s in the corresponding row and column of matrix A, and set to 2 if certain conditions.\n\nWait, maybe for each cell in the output, if the corresponding cell in matrix B is 1, then check if the cell in matrix A is 9. If yes, output 2. Otherwise, 0. But then, in example 0's output first row first element is 2. Matrix B's (0,0) is 0, which would not trigger that. So that's not it.\n\nAnother idea: Maybe the output is a transformation where for each position, if matrix A has a 0 and matrix B has a 1, then output 2. Let's check example 0's output first cell. A is 0, B is 0. So no. Output is 2, which doesn't fit. So that's not.\n\nWait, example 0's output first two rows have 2 in the first column. Let's look at matrix B's first column. In matrix B, the first column has 0,0,1. So in matrix B's third row first column is 1. But how does that relate to the output.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is determined by the product of A and B. But A has 9s and 0s. For example, 9*1=9, 9*0=0, etc. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe matrix B is a mask indicating where to look in matrix A. For example, if a cell in matrix B is 1, then the corresponding cell in matrix A is checked. If it's 9, then output 2, else 0. And if matrix B's cell is 0, then output 0. But let's check example 0.\n\nIn example 0, matrix B's first row is [0,1,0]. So in position (0,1) of matrix B is 1. Matrix A (0,1) is 9. So output (0,1) should be 2, but the output is [2,0,0], so (0,0) is 2. That doesn't match.\n\nHmm. This is tricky. Let's think differently. Maybe the output is the number of 9s in matrix A's row and column, modified by matrix B. Or perhaps the output is the count of 9s in matrix A, but only where matrix B has a 1 in the same position.\n\nWait, in example 0's output, the first two rows have 2 in the first column. Let's check matrix B's first column. The first three rows (matrix B's first column) are 0,0,1. So matrix B has a 1 in row 2, column 0. But in matrix A's column 0, the values are 0,0,9. So perhaps for column 0 in matrix A, there's a 9 in row 2, and matrix B has a 1 there. So maybe that's why output's column 0 has 2 in rows 0 and 1. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the sum of the 9s in matrix A's column and row, but only where matrix B has a 1. For example, for each cell in the output, check if matrix B has a 1 in that cell's row or column, then count the number of 9s in matrix A's corresponding row and column.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Let's try example 0 again.\n\nMatrix A:\nRow 0: 0,9,9\nRow 1: 0,9,9\nRow 2:9,9,9\n\nMatrix B:\nRow 0:0,1,0\nRow 1:0,0,1\nRow 2:1,1,1\n\nOutput:\nRow 0:2,0,0\nRow 1:2,0,0\nRow 2:0,0,0\n\nIn output row 0, column 0 is 2. Let's see if matrix B has any 1s in row 0 or column 0.\n\nMatrix B row 0: 0,1,0 \u2192 has a 1 in column 1.\n\nMatrix B column 0: 0,0,1 \u2192 has a 1 in row 2.\n\nSo for output cell (0,0), which is 2, maybe we look at the sum of 9s in matrix A's row 0 and column 0 where B has 1s in row 0 or column 0.\n\nIn matrix A row 0: two 9s (positions 1 and 2). In matrix B row 0, only column 1 has a 1, so perhaps those 9s in row 0 of A where B's row 0 has 1. So position (0,1) of A is 9, and B's row 0 has a 1 there. So that contributes a 9. But output cell (0,0) is 2. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe for each cell in the output, you look at the corresponding cell in matrix B. If B has a 1 in that cell, then look at the number of 9s in matrix A's row and column for that cell, and if that count is greater than 0, output 2. Otherwise 0. But example 0's output (0,0) is 2. Matrix B (0,0) is 0, so this wouldn't apply. So that's not it.\n\nAnother approach: maybe the output is 2 where there's a vertical or horizontal alignment of certain numbers between matrices A and B. For example, if in a column of matrix A there's a 9 and in the same column of matrix B there's a 1, then output 2 in that column. But example 0's first column of matrix B has 0,0,1. Matrix A's first column has 0,0,9. So the third row of matrix A's first column is 9 and matrix B's third row first column is 1. So maybe the output's first column (all three rows) would have 2s, but the output only has 2s in the first two rows. So that doesn't fit.\n\nWait, in example 0's output, the first column has 2,2,0. So first two rows are 2. Maybe if matrix B has a 1 in that column, then the count of 9s in matrix A's column up to that row. For example, in column 0 of matrix A, the third row is 9. Matrix B's column 0 has a 1 in row 2. So maybe for rows 0 and 1 of output column 0, they are 2 because there's a 9 below in the same column (row 2). But why would that be? Maybe if matrix B has a 1 in the column below, then mark the cells above as 2. So in this case, matrix B has a 1 in row 2 column 0, so output rows 0 and 1 column 0 are 2. That fits example 0's output.\n\nLet's check example 1. Output is [0,2,0] in row 0. The 2 is in column 1. Matrix B's column 1: row 0 has 0, row 1 has 0, row 2 has 0. So no 1s in column 1. Wait, but matrix B's row 0 column 1 is 0. So this approach might not work.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is 2 in positions where the corresponding cell in matrix B is 1 and any cell in the same column of matrix A has a 9. For example, in example 0's column 0 of matrix B, there's a 1 in row 2. So output column 0 is 2 for all rows. But example 0's output column 0 has 2 in rows 0 and 1, but 0 in row 2. So that doesn't fit.\n\nWait, example 0's output first two rows have 2 in column 0, and matrix B's column 0 has a 1 in row 2. So maybe for any row where matrix B's column has a 1 in any row, the output for that column is 2 in all rows above the 1. So in example 0's column 0, the 1 is in row 2. So rows 0 and 1 get 2, row 2 is 0. Which matches the output. That could be a pattern.\n\nLet's check example 1's output. In example 1's matrix B, column 0 has 1 in row 0, 1 in row 1, and 1 in row 2. So according to this rule, the entire column would have 2s above each 1. But the output for example 1 is:\n\n[0,2,0]\n[0,0,0]\n[0,2,0]\n\nHmm. Column 0 in matrix B has 1s in rows 0,1,2. So according to the rule, each row in column 0 of the output would have 2s above each 1. But row 0's column 0 is 0. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's the rows where matrix B has a 1. For example, if a row in matrix B has a 1 in any position, then the corresponding row in the output has 2s in positions where matrix A has 9s. But example 0's matrix B has rows with 1s in row 0 (position 1), row 1 (position 2), row 2 (all 1s). So for row 0 of matrix B, there's a 1 in position 1. Matrix A row 0 has 9s in positions 1 and 2. So output row 0 would have 2s in positions 1 and 2. But example 0's output row 0 is [2,0,0]. Doesn't match.\n\nAnother approach: Let's think of the output as a result of combining the two matrices in some way. For example, overlay them and perform some operation. But I'm not sure.\n\nWait, let's look for the number of 2s in the outputs. In example 0, there are three 2s. Example 1 has two. Example 2 has six. Example 3 has two. Example 4 has three. So varying numbers.\n\nAnother idea: Maybe the output is a 3x3 grid where each cell is 2 if the corresponding cell in matrix A is 0 and the corresponding cell in matrix B is 1. Otherwise, 0. Let's check example 0. Matrix B has a 1 in row 0 column 1, which is B[0][1] =1. Matrix A's [0][1] is 9, so that's not 0. So output would be 0 there. But example 0's output has 2s in [0][0] and [1][0]. Matrix B's [0][0] is 0, so that's not 1. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output cell is 2 if the sum of the corresponding cells in matrix A and B is even. But example 0's first output cell is 2. A[0][0] + B[0][0] = 0+0=0 (even), so 2. Yes. But what about other cells. In example 0, A[0][1] is9, B[0][1] is1. Sum is10, even \u2192 2. But output is 0. So that doesn't fit.\n\nHmm.\n\nWait, maybe the output is 2 if the cell in matrix A is 0 and the cell below it in matrix B is 1. For example, in example 0, output row 0 column 0 is 2. Matrix A's [0][0] is 0, and matrix B's row below (row 1) column 0 is 0. That doesn't work. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output cell is 2 where the corresponding cell in matrix A is 9 and the cell in the same position in matrix B is 1. Let's check example 1's output. In matrix A, [0][0] is9, matrix B [0][0] is1. So output should be 2. But example 1's output [0][0] is 0. So that's not.\n\nThis is really challenging. Maybe I need to look for another pattern.\n\nAnother approach: The output is a 3x3 matrix. Let's see if it's the sum of matrix A and matrix B, modulo something. But example 0's matrix A's first row is [0,9,9], matrix B's first row is [0,1,0]. Sum is [0,10,9]. Modulo something? 10 mod 5 is 0, but output is 2. Doesn't fit.\n\nWait, maybe the output cell is 2 if the cell in matrix A is 9 and the cell in matrix B is 1. Let's check example 1:\n\nMatrix A's [0][0] is9, matrix B [0][0] is1. So output [0][0] should be 2, but the output is 0. So that's not it.\n\nAlternatively, if matrix A cell is 0 and matrix B cell is 1, output 2. Let's check example 0. B has [0,1,0], [0,0,1], [1,1,1]. For example, matrix B's third row first column is1. Matrix A's third row first column is9. So no. But the output's third row first column is0. So that's not.\n\nWait, maybe the output is 2 where the sum of the corresponding cells in matrix A and B is 9. For example, A cell + B cell =9. Let's see example 0:\n\nA[0][0] =0, B[0][0]=0 \u2192 sum 0. Output is2. No. Doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, if the sum is 9, output 2. For example, in example 1, A[0][0] is9, B[0][0] is1 \u2192 sum10. So no.\n\nNot matching.\n\nAnother idea: Maybe the output is 2 where in matrix A there is a 9 and in the same column in matrix B there is a 1. For example, in example 0's column 0: matrix A has 0,0,9. Matrix B has 0,0,1. So in column 0, the third row of B has 1. So output all cells in column 0 where there's a 9 in A's column 0. So A's third row has 9 in column 0. So output's column 0 would have 2s for any row where A's column 0 has a 9 and B's column 0 has a 1. But A's column 0 has 9 only in row 2. So output column 0 row 2 would be 2. But in example 0's output, column 0 row 2 is 0. So no.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is 2 where the column in matrix A has a 9 and the same column in matrix B has a 1 in any position. For example, in example 0's column 0: B has a 1 in row 2. So the entire column 0 in the output is 2. But example 0's output column 0 has 2s in rows 0 and 1. So maybe it's the cells above the 1 in matrix B's column. So in matrix B's column 0, the 1 is in row 2. So output's column 0 rows 0 and 1 are 2, row 2 is 0. Which matches example 0. Let's check example 1.\n\nExample 1's matrix B column 0: B[0][0]=1, B[1][0]=1, B[2][0]=1. So for each cell in column 0 of output, if there's a 1 in matrix B's column 0 in any row below, then output 2. Wait, but in example 1's output column 0 has [0,0,0]. So this doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. Maybe the pattern is vertical. For each column in the output, if in matrix B there's a 1 in that column, then the output for that column's cells where matrix A has 9s above (including the row of the 1) get 2. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, let's think of the output as a kind of \"coverage\" where if a cell in matrix B is 1, it activates certain cells in the output based on the corresponding cell in matrix A. For example, if B[i][j] is 1, then the output cells in the same row and column as A[i][j] where A has 9s are set to 2.\n\nWait, perhaps for each 1 in matrix B, look at the corresponding cell in matrix A. If that cell is 9, then set the entire row and column of that cell in the output to 2, but overlapping 2s may overwrite each other. Let's test this.\n\nIn example 0's matrix B, there are 1s in:\n\nRow 0, column 1.\n\nRow 1, column 2.\n\nRow 2, all columns (since B's third row is [1,1,1}).\n\nFor each of these, check if matrix A's cell is 9.\n\nMatrix A's cell for B's row 0, column 1: A[0][1] is9 \u2192 yes. So set row 0 and column 1 of output to 2.\n\nBut the output is [2,0,0], [2,0,0], [0,0,0]. So row 0 is 2,0,0. Column 1 is 0,0,0. That doesn't fit. So this idea is incorrect.\n\nAnother angle: The output seems to have 2s in positions where there are 9s in matrix A and 1s in matrix B, but only in certain patterns. Let's look for positions where both matrices have 9 and 1 in the same cell.\n\nIn example 0's matrix A and B:\n\nA[0][1] =9, B[0][1]=1 \u2192 output[0][1] should be 2, but the output has 0. So that's not.\n\nExample 1's matrix A[0][0] =9, B[0][0}=1. Output[0][0}=0. So that doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. This is really challenging.\n\nLet me think of the test input:\n\nMatrix A:\n[9,0,9]\n[0,0,9]\n[9,0,9]\n\nMatrix B:\n[0,1,1]\n[0,1,0]\n[1,0,0]\n\nPossible output: need to find a pattern.\n\nLet me look for previous examples where similar input structures exist.\n\nLooking at example 4's input:\n\nMatrix A:\n[0,9,0]\n[0,9,9]\n[0,9,9]\n\nMatrix B:\n[0,0,0]\n[1,1,1]\n[1,0,1]\n\nOutput:\n[2,0,2]\n[0,0,0]\n[0,0,0]\n\nSo, the output's first row has 2s in columns 0 and 2. Let's see matrix B. The first row of B is all 0s. So perhaps the output is determined by the lower rows in B. For example, in example 4, matrix B has 1s in rows 1 and 2. For row 1, all 1s. So maybe for each 1 in matrix B's row 1 and 2, we look at matrix A's corresponding cell. If it's 0, then output 2 in the same row but different columns.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is determined by the number of 9s in matrix A's row where matrix B's row has a 1. For example, in example 4's matrix B's row 1 has 1s. Matrix A's row 1 is [0,9,9]. So two 9s. The output row 0 has two 2s. But not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the sum of each column in matrix A where the corresponding column in matrix B has at least one 1, multiplied by 2. But example 0's first column sum in A is 0+0+9=9. Matrix B's column 0 has a 1 in row 2. So output first column would be 9*2=18 mod something? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is 2 in every cell where the corresponding cell in matrix A is 0 and there's a 1 in the same column of matrix B. Let's check example 0's output:\n\nMatrix A has 0s in (0,0), (0,1) is 9, (0,2) is9. Matrix B's column 0 has a 1 in row 2. So cells in column 0 of matrix A that are 0 would be (0,0) and (1,0). So output column 0 would have 2s in rows 0 and 1. Which matches example 0's output. Let's check another example.\n\nExample 1's output:\n\n[0,2,0]\n[0,0,0]\n[0,2,0]\n\nMatrix A's 0s are in (0,1), (1,0), (1,1), (2,0), (2,1). Matrix B's columns:\n\nColumn 0: 1,1,1 (matrix B's first column has 1s in all rows). So for matrix A's 0s in column 0 (like (1,0), (2,0)), if there's a 1 in the same column of B, then output 2. So in example 1, matrix A's (1,0) is 0. B's column 0 has 1s. So output (1,0) should be 2. But the output's row 1 has 0. So that's not.\n\nHmm. This idea might not work.\n\nWait, example 0's output column 0 has 2s in rows 0 and 1. In matrix A, column 0 has 0,0,9. matrix B's column 0 has 0,0,1. So the 1 is in row 2. So for rows 0 and 1, matrix A has 0s, and matrix B's column 0 has a 1 in row 2. So perhaps the output is 2 for cells where matrix A's cell is 0 and in the same column, matrix B has a 1 in any row below it. So in example 0's column 0, row 0 and 1 are 0s in A, and B's column 0 has a 1 in row 2. So output those cells as 2. That fits. Let's check example 1.\n\nExample 1's matrix B column 0 has 1 in all rows. Matrix A's column 0 has 9,0,0. So for cells where A's cell is 0 and B's column has a 1 below them.\n\nIn example 1's matrix A, row 1 column 0 is 0. B's column 0 has a 1 in row 2. So output row 1 column 0 should be 2. But example 1's output row 1 column 0 is 0. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's the cells where A is 0 and B has a 1 in the same column, regardless of the row. So for example 0's column 0, B has a 1 in row 2, so any 0 in column 0 of A is marked as 2. So output column 0 has 2s where A is 0. So example 0's column 0 has two 0s in rows 0 and 1, so output 2s there. That works.\n\nExample 1's matrix B column 0 has 1s in all rows. So any 0 in matrix A's column 0 should be 2. Matrix A's column 0 has 9,0,0. So the two 0s in rows 1 and 2 would be 2. But example 1's output column 0 is [0,0,0]. So that doesn't fit.\n\nHmm.\n\nAnother angle: Maybe the output is 2 where matrix A has a 0 and in the same position in matrix B, there's a 1. But in example 0's matrix B, (0,0) is 0. So no. But output's (0,0) is 2. So not matching.\n\nWait, maybe the output is 2 where in matrix A, there's a 0, and in matrix B, the sum of the column (including that row and below) has at least one 1. So for example, in example 0's cell (0,0): A is 0, and in B's column 0, there's a 1 in row 2. So output 2. For cell (1,0): A is 0, B's column 0 has 1 in row 2. So output 2. For cell (2,0): A is 9, so no. This would fit example 0's output. Let's check example 1.\n\nExample 1's matrix B column 0 has 1s in all rows. Matrix A's column 0 has 9,0,0. So for cell (1,0): A is 0, and B's column 0 has 1 in row 2 and row 1 and row 0. So output 2. But example 1's output for (1,0) is 0. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is 2 where A is 0 and B's corresponding cell is 1, but also in the same column of B, there's a 1 in a lower row. For example, if a cell in B is 1 and A is 0, and there's a 1 in B's column below it. So in example 0's cell (0,0), B is 0. So no. But example 0's output (0,0) is 2. So this doesn't work.\n\nThis is getting really frustrating. Maybe I need to think of a completely different approach.\n\nLet's think of the input matrices as two 3x3 grids stacked. The output is another 3x3 grid where each cell is 2 if a certain condition is met between the two grids.\n\nLooking at example 0's output, there are two 2s in the first column. The first two rows of the first column in the output are 2. The third row is 0. In matrix A's first column, the first two rows are 0 and the third is 9. In matrix B's first column, the third row is 1. So maybe when a column in B has a 1 in a row, the output's cells above that row in the same column are 2, provided that the corresponding cells in A are 0.\n\nSo for example, in example 0's column 0 of B, there's a 1 in row 2. So the cells above (rows 0 and 1) in column 0 of the output are 2 if A's cell is 0. Since A's column 0 rows 0 and 1 are 0, they become 2. The third row is 9, so it remains 0.\n\nLet's check example 1:\n\nMatrix B's column 0 has 1s in all three rows. So for each row in column 0, the cells above would include all rows above. But for row 0, there are no rows above. For row 1, the row above is row 0. For row 2, the rows above are 0 and 1. But the output's column 0 is [0,0,0]. So this doesn't fit. Unless the condition is that A's cell must be 0. Let's see. In example 1's matrix A's column 0 is [9,0,0]. So for row 0, A's cell is 9 \u2192 no. Row 1, A's cell is 0, so output would be 2. Row 2's cell in A is 0, but there's a 1 in B's row 2, so the cells above would be rows 0 and 1. But the output for column 0 is all 0s. So this doesn't fit.\n\nThis is really not working. Let's try example 2.\n\nExample 2's output is:\n\n[2,0,2]\n[0,2,0]\n[0,2,2]\n\nMatrix A:\n[0,9,0]\n[9,0,9]\n[9,0,0]\n\nMatrix B:\n[0,0,0]\n[0,0,1]\n[1,0,0]\n\nSo in B's column 2, there's a 1 in row 1. So output's column 2 would have 2s above row 1 (row 0). But matrix A's row 0 column 2 is 0. So output row 0 column 2 is 2. That's correct. Then, in B's column 0, there's a 1 in row 2. So output's column 0 rows 0 and 1 are 2 if A's cells are 0. Matrix A's column 0 is [0,9,9]. So row 0 is 0 \u2192 2, row 1 is 9 \u2192 no. So output column 0 has 2 in row 0. But example 2's output column 0 is [2,0,0]. So that's correct for row 0, but row 2's column 0 is 9 in A, so output is 0. Also, B's column 0 has 1 in row 2. So this pattern fits for row 0.\n\nBut why are there other 2s in example 2's output? Like row 1 column 1 is 2. Matrix B's column 1 has no 1s. So that's conflicting.\n\nMaybe the pattern is not consistent across examples. This is really challenging.\n\nWait, another idea: perhaps the output is determined by the sum of the corresponding elements in matrices A and B, but with a twist. For example, if the sum is 9 (A=9, B=0) or 10 (A=9, B=1), then output 2. But example 0's output cell (0,0) is 2, and sum is 0+0=0. So that's not.\n\nAlternatively, if A is 9 and B is 0, output 2. But example 0's output has 2 where A is 0. So no.\n\nHmm. I'm stuck. Let me try to think of another way.\n\nLooking at example 0's output again: the two 2s are in the first column. Matrix B's column 0 has a 1 in row 2. Matrix A's column 0 has 0,0,9. So perhaps the output is 2 for every 0 in matrix A's column where there's a 1 in matrix B's column. So for each column, if there's a 1 in B, then any 0 in A's column becomes 2. So in example 0's column 0, B has a 1 in row 2, so the 0s in A's column 0 (rows 0 and 1) become 2. This fits example 0's output.\n\nExample 1's matrix B's columns:\n\nColumn 0: 1,1,1.\n\nMatrix A's column 0:9,0,0.\n\nSo any 0s in A's column 0 would become 2. So rows 1 and 2 of column 0 in A are 0 \u2192 output 2. But example 1's output column 0 is [0,0,0]. So that doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. This is confusing. Let's check example 4:\n\nMatrix B's columns:\n\nColumn 0: 0,1,1.\n\nMatrix A's column 0:0,0,0.\n\nSo any 0 in A's column 0 where B's column has 1s. The 1s in B's column 0 are in rows 1 and 2. So rows 0,1,2 of column 0 in A are 0. So output would be 2 for all three rows. But example 4's output column 0 has [2,0,0]. So this doesn't fit.\n\nWait, example 4's output first row is [2,0,2]. Maybe the pattern is that for each 1 in matrix B, if the corresponding cell in matrix A is 0, then output 2 in the same position. But matrix B's first row is [0,0,0], so no. Then, in matrix B's row 1 and 2, there are 1s. Let's see:\n\nMatrix B's row 1: [1,1,1]. Matrix A's row 1: [0,9,9]. So cells where B is 1 and A is 0 are (1,0). So output (1,0) should be 2. But example 4's output row 1 is [0,0,0]. So that doesn't fit.\n\nThis is really tough. Perhaps the answer is to look for the number of 9s in matrix A's rows and columns where matrix B has a 1. But I'm not seeing it.\n\nAnother observation: In example 0's output, the first two rows are [2,0,0], [2,0,0]. The third row is [0,0,0]. Matrix B's third row is [1,1,1]. So why is the output row 3 all zeros?\n\nPerhaps the output is generated by adding 2 for each 9 in matrix A's cell if the corresponding cell in matrix B is 1. But in example 0's matrix B has a 1 in row 0, column 1. Matrix A's cell (0,1) is 9. So output cell (0,1) should be 2. But example 0's output (0,1) is 0. So that's not.\n\nAlternatively, the output is the sum of 9s in matrix A's rows where matrix B's corresponding row has a 1. For example, in example 0's matrix B's row 0 has a 1 in column 1. Matrix A's row 0 has two 9s. But output row 0 has sum 2. Not sure.\n\nWait, maybe the output is generated by, for each row in matrix B, if the row contains a 1, then the corresponding row in the output has 2s in the positions where matrix A's row has 9s. Otherwise, 0s.\n\nExample 0's matrix B has rows:\n\nRow0:0,1,0 \u2192 contains 1. Matrix A's row0:0,9,9. So output row0 would be 0,2,2. But the actual output is [2,0,0]. So that's not matching.\n\nAnother Idea: The output is the number of 9s in matrix A's row and column for each cell, but only where matrix B's corresponding cell is 1. But not sure.\n\nAlternatively, think of matrix B as a mask that indicates where to flip the 9s in matrix A to 2s. So wherever matrix B has a 1, and matrix A has a 9, output is 2. Otherwise, 0. But let's check example 0's output. Matrix B's row0 has a 1 in column1. Matrix A's row0 column1 is9. So output row0 column1 would be 2, but example0's output is 0. So no.\n\nWait, perhaps the output is 2 wherever matrix A has a 0 and matrix B has a 1. Let's check example 0. Matrix A has 0s in (0,0), (1,0), (0,1) and (1,1) are9, etc. Matrix B has 1s in (0,1), (1,2), (2,0), (2,1), (2,2). So in example0, the positions where A is0 and B is1 are:\n\nA's (0,0) is0, B's (0,0) is0 \u2192 no.\n\nA's (1,0) is0, B's (1,0) is0 \u2192 no.\n\nA's (0,1) is9, B's (0,1) is1 \u2192 no.\n\nA's (1,2) is9, B's (1,2) is1 \u2192 no.\n\nA's (2,0) is9, B's (2,0) is1 \u2192 no.\n\nSo no cells where A is0 and B is1. So output should be all zeros, but example0's output has 2s. So that's not.\n\nI'm really stuck. Given the time I've spent, perhaps I should try to find a pattern based on the test input and see if it fits any of the examples.\n\nTest input:\n\nMatrix A:\n[9,0,9]\n[0,0,9]\n[9,0,9]\n\nMatrix B:\n[0,1,1]\n[0,1,0]\n[1,0,0]\n\nLet me try applying the hypothesis that the output is 2 wherever matrix A has a 0 and in the same column of matrix B there is a 1 in any row.\n\nFor each cell in matrix A that is 0, check if there's a 1 in the same column of matrix B. If yes, output 2.\n\nMatrix A's 0s are:\n\n(0,1), (1,0), (1,1), (2,1).\n\nMatrix B's columns:\n\nColumn0: B[0][0]=0, B[1][0]=0, B[2][0]=1 \u2192 has 1.\n\nColumn1: B[0][1]=1, B[1][1]=1, B[2][1]=0 \u2192 has 1s in row0 and row1.\n\nColumn2: B[0][2]=1, B[1][2]=0, B[2][2}=0 \u2192 has 1 in row0.\n\nSo for matrix A's 0s:\n\n(0,1): column1 has 1s \u2192 output 2.\n\n(1,0): column0 has 1 \u2192 output 2.\n\n(1,1): column1 has 1s \u2192 output 2.\n\n(2,1): column1 has 1s \u2192 output 2.\n\nSo output would have 2s in these positions. But how to arrange them into a 3x3 matrix?\n\nThe positions are:\n\nRow0, column1 \u2192 2.\n\nRow1, columns0 and 1 \u2192 2 each.\n\nRow2, column1 \u2192 2.\n\nBut the output needs to be a 3x3 matrix. So the output would be:\n\nRow0: [0,2,0]\n\nRow1: [2,2,0]\n\nRow2: [0,2,0]\n\nBut looking at the examples, perhaps the output should have 2s where A is 0 and there's a 1 in the same column of B. So the test input's output would have 2s at (0,1), (1,0), (1,1), (2,1). So the output would be:\n\n[0,2,0]\n\n[2,2,0]\n\n[0,2,0]\n\nBut looking at the examples, the outputs don't have more than two 2s in a row. For instance, example 2 has a row with two 2s. So this could be possible.\n\nBut I need to check if this matches any of the previous examples.\n\nExample0's output: two 2s in column0. In matrix A's column0, there are 0s in rows0 and1. B's column0 has a 1 in row2. So according to this hypothesis, the 0s in A's column0 would have 2s. So output rows0 and1 column0 are 2, which matches example0's output. So this seems to fit.\n\nExample1's matrix B columns:\n\nColumn0 has 1s in all rows. Matrix A's column0 has 9,0,0. So the 0s in A's column0 (rows1 and2) would output 2. So output rows1 and2 column0 would be 2. But example1's output is:\n\n[0,2,0]\n\n[0,0,0]\n\n[0,2,0]\n\nWhich doesn't have 2s in column0. So this hypothesis is incorrect.\n\nBut wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me check example1's matrix B column0. It has 1s in all rows. Matrix A's column0 has 9 in row0, 0 in row1, 0 in row2. So according to the hypothesis, the output's column0 rows1 and2 would be 2. But in example1's output, column0 is all 0s. So this doesn't fit.\n\nSo the hypothesis is invalid.\n\nThis suggests that the pattern is more complex. Maybe the output is 2 where matrix A has a 0, and in the same column of matrix B, there is a 1 in a row below the current row. For example, in example0's column0, the 1 in B is in row2. So rows0 and1 (which are above row2) would have 2s if A's cell is0. This fits example0.\n\nIn example0's row0, column0: A is0, B has a 1 in row2 below. So output is2.\n\nIn example0's row1, column0: A is0, B has a 1 below in row2. So output is2.\n\nIn example0's row2, column0: A is9, so no.\n\nFor example1's matrix B column0 has 1s in rows0,1,2. So for row0, B has 1s in the same row and below. So any 0s in A's column0 would have output 2. Matrix A's column0 row0 is9 \u2192 no. Row1 is0 \u2192 has 1s below (rows1 and2). So output row1 column0 is2. Row2 is0, but there's no rows below, so no. But example1's output column0 is all 0s.\n\nThis still doesn't fit.\n\nGiven the time I've invested without success, perhaps I should proceed with the test input based on the hypothesis that the output is 2 wherever matrix A has a 0 and in the same column of matrix B, there's a 1 in any row below it.\n\nFor the test input:\n\nMatrix A's 0s are:\n\n(0,1), (1,0), (1,1), (2,1).\n\nMatrix B's columns:\n\nColumn0: B[2][0]=1. So in column0, 1 is in row2. So for rows0 and1, which are above, in matrix A's column0, any 0s. Matrix A's column0 is9,0,9. So row1, column0 is0 \u2192 output (1,0) is2.\n\nColumn1: B[0][1]=1, B[1][1}=1. So for column1, any 0s in A's rows0 and1. Matrix A's column1 is0,0,0. So rows0,1,2 would have 2s in column1 if there are 1s below. For row0, there's a 1 in row0 and below. So output (0,1)=2. For row1, there's a 1 in row1 and below (row1's own row and row2 is0). So output (1,1)=2. For row2, no rows below. So (2,1) remains 0.\n\nColumn2: B[0][2}=1. So for rows0 and1 in matrix A's column2, any 0s. Matrix A's column2 is9,9,9. So no 0s. So no 2s.\n\nSo output cells would be:\n\n(0,1)=2, (1,0)=2, (1,1)=2.\n\nBut how to arrange this into a 3x3 matrix. Possible output:\n\n[0,2,0]\n\n[2,2,0]\n\n[0,0,0]\n\nBut looking at the examples, this doesn't match any format. However, none of the examples have three 2s in a single row. But this is just a hypothesis.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the test input's output is:\n\n[0,2,0]\n\n[0,2,0]\n\n[2,0,0]\n\nBut I'm not sure. Given the time I've spent, I'll make an educated guess based on the hypothesis that the output is 2 for every 0 in matrix A where there's a 1 in the same column of matrix B below the current row. For the test input:\n\nCells where this is true:\n\nIn column0 of B, 1 is in row2. Matrix A's column0 has 0 in row1. So (1,0)=2.\n\nIn column1 of B, 1s in row0 and1. For row0, any 0s in A's column1 with 1s below. Matrix A's column1 is 0 in row0,0 in row1,0 in row2. For row0, there are 1s below (row0,1). So (0,1)=2. For row1, there's a 1 in row1, but no rows below. So (1,1) would not be 2. For row2, no. So (0,1)=2.\n\nIn column2 of B, 1 in row0. So for rows0 and1, any 0s in A's column2. A's column2 has 9 in all rows. So no 2s.\n\nThus, output would be:\n\nRow0: [0,2,0]\n\nRow1: [2,0,0]\n\nRow2: [0,0,0]\n\nBut looking at the example outputs, this might not match any previous pattern. However, example1's output has 2s in (0,1) and (2,1). So maybe this is similar.\n\nBut I'm not confident. Given the time I've spent, I'll proceed with this answer."
