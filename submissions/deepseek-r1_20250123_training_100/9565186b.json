        "cot_1": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. I need to look at the training examples and see how the input is transformed into the output. Let's start by examining each example one by one.\n\nLooking at Example 0:\n\nInput:\n[2,2,2]\n[2,1,8]\n[2,8,8]\n\nOutput:\n[2,2,2]\n[2,5,5]\n[2,5,5]\n\nHmm, the first row stays the same. The second row has the middle element changed from 1 to 5 and the last from 8 to 5. The third row's last two elements become 5. Maybe there's something about the positions adjacent to certain numbers. Like, if an element is not 2 (since the first row is all 2s and remains unchanged), then maybe it's replaced by 5. But wait, the second row starts with 2, which remains, and the others become 5. So maybe the elements that are not part of a \"solid\" row (all same numbers) get replaced?\n\nWait, let's check the other examples.\n\nExample 1:\n\nInput:\n[1,1,1]\n[8,1,3]\n[8,2,2]\n\nOutput:\n[1,1,1]\n[5,1,5]\n[5,5,5]\n\nThe first row is all 1s, so it's unchanged. The second row has 8 and 3, which are replaced by 5, but the middle 1 stays. The third row's first element is 8, replaced by 5, and the rest 2s become 5. Wait, but in the output, the third row becomes all 5s. So maybe rows that are not all the same are being converted. But the second row has 8,1,3. The middle element is 1, which stays. The others become 5. So maybe elements that are not equal to the first row's value (since the first row is all 1s here) are being replaced, except if they are adjacent to a 1? Or perhaps it's about the first row's elements. Let's think.\n\nIn Example 0, first row is all 2s. The second row's first element is 2, so it stays. The other elements (1 and 8) become 5. The third row's first is 2, but the others are 8s, which become 5. So perhaps, for each row after the first, any element that is not equal to the first element of that row is replaced by 5. Wait, in Example 0's second row: first element is 2 (same as row's first), so stays. The second element (1) is not equal to the row's first (2), so becomes 5. Third element (8) also becomes 5. Then third row's first is 2, same as first element. The other elements (8,8) are not 2, so become 5. That seems to fit.\n\nLet's check Example 1. First row is all 1s. Second row: first element 8 (not 1), becomes 5. Middle element is 1 (same as first row's first element?), but wait the row's first element is 8, but in the output, it's 5. Wait, maybe the first row's first element is the key. For rows after the first, each element that is not equal to the first row's first element is replaced by 5. Let's see:\n\nExample 0 first row's first element is 2. So in the other rows, any element not equal to 2 becomes 5. In example 0's second row, 2 stays, 1 and 8 become 5. Third row: 2 stays, 8s become 5. Yes.\n\nExample 1 first row's first element is 1. So in the other rows, any element not equal to 1 becomes 5. Second row: 8 becomes 5, 1 stays, 3 becomes 5. Third row: 8 becomes 5, 2 becomes 5, 2 becomes 5. So the output rows become [5,1,5] and [5,5,5]. Which matches the output.\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput:\n[2,2,2]\n[8,8,2]\n[2,2,2]\n\nOutput:\n[2,2,2]\n[5,5,2]\n[2,2,2]\n\nFirst row's first element is 2. So in the second row, elements not equal to 2 become 5. The first two elements are 8, so become 5. The last is 2, stays. Third row is all 2s, remains.\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput:\n[3,3,8]\n[4,4,4]\n[8,1,1]\n\nOutput:\n[5,5,5]\n[4,4,4]\n[5,5,5]\n\nHmm. Wait, the first row's first element is 3. But in the output, the first row is all 5s. Wait, that contradicts the previous pattern. Unless there's another rule here. Let me see.\n\nWait, in Example 3, the first input row is [3,3,8]. The output is [5,5,5]. So the first row itself is being changed. But in previous examples, the first row was left as is. So maybe the initial assumption is wrong.\n\nWait, maybe the pattern is different. Let's re-examine all examples.\n\nAlternative approach: look for patterns in the output. The outputs have a lot of 5s. Let's see when elements are turned into 5.\n\nIn Example 3's input, the first row is [3,3,8]. Output is all 5s. The second row [4,4,4] remains. Third row becomes all 5s. So maybe rows that are not all the same are converted to all 5s. But the first row is [3,3,8] which is not all same, so converted. The second row is all 4s, remains. Third row [8,1,1] is not all same, so converted. But in Example 0, the first row is all 2s, remains. The second row [2,1,8] is not all same, but the output is [2,5,5]. Wait, that's not all 5s. So that contradicts.\n\nAlternative idea: maybe each cell in the output is 5 unless it is part of a contiguous block (like same as neighbors) in the input. Or perhaps, the cells that are equal to the majority in their row or column. Not sure.\n\nWait, let's look at Example 0 again. The input's second row is [2,1,8]. The output is [2,5,5]. So the first element is 2, which is the same as the first row's first element. But why is that one kept? Maybe the rule is: the first row's elements determine which values are kept in the subsequent rows, and others are replaced by 5. But in Example 3, the first row's first element is 3, but the output for the first row is all 5s. So that doesn't fit.\n\nWait, maybe the first row is the key. For each row after the first, the elements that are equal to the first element of the first row are kept; others are replaced by 5. But in Example 0, first row's first element is 2. So rows after first: elements equal to 2 stay, others become 5. That fits Example 0. Second row: 2 stays, others become 5. Third row: first element 2 stays, others become 5.\n\nExample 1: first row's first element is 1. Rows after that: elements equal to 1 stay, others become 5. So second row's 8 and 3 become 5, 1 stays. Third row's 8 and 2s become 5. Which matches the output.\n\nExample 2: first row's first element is 2. Rows after: elements equal to 2 stay. So second row's last element 2 stays, others become 5. Third row is all 2s, so stays. Output matches.\n\nBut Example 3 breaks this. The first row is [3,3,8]. So first element is 3. Then the first row's output is all 5s. But according to previous pattern, the first row would stay as is. But in the output, it's changed. So that's conflicting. So maybe the pattern is different. Let's check Example 3's input and output again.\n\nInput Example3:\n\n[3,3,8]\n[4,4,4]\n[8,1,1]\n\nOutput:\n\n[5,5,5]\n[4,4,4]\n[5,5,5]\n\nAh, here the first row is [3,3,8]. The output is all 5s. Second row is [4,4,4], output is same. Third row becomes all 5s. So maybe the rule is: for each row, if all elements are the same, leave them; otherwise, replace the entire row with 5s. But in Example 0's second row [2,1,8], which is not all same, but output is [2,5,5], not all 5s. So that contradicts.\n\nAlternative idea: maybe if the entire row is not uniform, then any elements that are not the same as the first element of that row become 5. Let's check.\n\nExample0's second row is [2,1,8]. The first element is 2, so elements 1 and 8 are not 2, so become 5. So the output becomes [2,5,5]. Third row [2,8,8]: first element is 2. 8s are not 2, so become 5. Output [2,5,5]. That fits.\n\nExample1's second row [8,1,3]: first element is 8. So 1 and 3 are not 8, so become 5. But the output is [5,1,5]. Wait, that doesn't fit. Because the first element 8 is not 1, so why is the 1 kept? Unless the rule is different. Maybe for each row after the first, elements are compared to the first row's first element.\n\nWait, maybe the rule is: for each row, if the row's first element is the same as the first row's first element, then in that row, elements not equal to that value are changed to 5. Otherwise, the entire row is changed to 5s.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nIn Example0, first row's first element is 2. The second row's first element is 2 (same as first row), so in that row, elements not 2 are changed to 5. Third row's first element is 2, same as first row, so elements not 2 become 5.\n\nExample1: first row's first element is 1. Second row's first element is 8 (different), so the entire row becomes 5s? But no, the output is [5,1,5]. Hmm, that doesn't fit. So that can't be.\n\nAlternative approach: let's check if the output is such that all the 5s are replacing elements that are not part of the first row's value. So, for all rows except the first, if an element is not equal to the first row's first value, it becomes 5. But the first row's elements are all 5s if they are not uniform? Or maybe the first row is treated differently.\n\nWait, in Example3, the first row's output is all 5s. The input first row is [3,3,8]. So perhaps if the first row is not uniform, then all its elements are replaced with 5. Then, for the other rows: if the row is uniform, leave it as is; otherwise, replace elements not equal to the first row's first element (but if the first row was replaced with 5s, then maybe the key is 5? Wait, that's getting complicated.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is: for each row, if the row is uniform (all elements same), then leave it as is. Otherwise, replace each element that is not the same as the majority of the first elements of the previous rows. Or something else. This is getting tricky.\n\nLooking at Example3 again. The input's first row is [3,3,8], not uniform. So output is all 5s. The second row is [4,4,4], uniform, so remains. Third row [8,1,1], not uniform, becomes all 5s.\n\nBut in Example0, the second and third rows are not uniform. But their outputs are not all 5s. So maybe the rule is: if the row is not uniform, change each element that is not the same as the first element of that row to 5. But for the first row, if it's not uniform, change all elements to 5.\n\nSo for Example3's first row: not uniform, all 5s. Second row is uniform, so stays. Third row: not uniform, so elements not equal to 8 (the first element of the row) become 5. But third row's first element is 8. The other elements are 1 and 1. So output would be [8,5,5], but the actual output is [5,5,5]. So that doesn't fit.\n\nWait, maybe the first row is treated as a special case. If the first row isn't uniform, then the entire first row is 5s. Then, for the other rows: if the row is uniform, leave it. Otherwise, replace elements not equal to the first element of their own row with 5. Let's check this.\n\nExample3:\n\nFirst row not uniform \u2192 all 5s.\n\nSecond row is uniform [4,4,4] \u2192 remains.\n\nThird row [8,1,1] \u2192 not uniform. So elements not 8 become 5. Output would be [8,5,5], but actual output is [5,5,5]. So that doesn't fit. So that's not the case.\n\nAlternative idea: For the entire matrix, any element that is not part of a contiguous block (same as adjacent elements) is changed to 5. But Example0's first row is all 2s, so remains. The second row's first element is 2 (adjacent to the first row's 2?), but in the same column. Wait, maybe it's considering horizontal adjacency. For example, in a row, elements that are not the same as their neighbors are changed. But Example0's second row is [2,1,8]. The 2 is adjacent to 1, which is different. The 1 is between 2 and 8. So all three are different. So maybe all elements that are not part of a horizontal trio are replaced. But in that case, the output for Example0's second row would be all 5s, but it's [2,5,5]. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternative approach: Let's think of the output as replacing certain elements with 5 based on their position and relation to the first row. For instance, the first row determines a \"target\" value, and any element in the subsequent rows that isn't equal to that target becomes 5. However, if the first row isn't uniform, then all elements in the matrix that aren't part of a uniform row are replaced with 5.\n\nBut in Example3, the first row isn't uniform, so all non-uniform rows become 5s. The second row is uniform, so stays. The third row is non-uniform, so becomes 5s. And the first row becomes 5s because it's non-uniform. That fits Example3.\n\nBut in Example0, first row is uniform. So the target is 2. All other elements not equal to 2 become 5. Which fits. Example1's first row is uniform (1), so other elements not 1 become 5. Example2's first row is uniform (2), so other elements not 2 become 5.\n\nSo the pattern seems to be:\n\n- For the entire matrix:\n\n   - If the first row is uniform (all elements same), then:\n\n      - Keep the first row as is.\n\n      - For each subsequent row, change any element that is not equal to the first row's value to 5.\n\n   - If the first row is not uniform:\n\n      - Change all elements in the first row to 5.\n\n      - For each subsequent row:\n\n         - If the row is uniform (all elements same), leave it as is.\n\n         - If the row is not uniform, change all elements in that row to 5.\n\nLet's test this against the examples.\n\nExample0:\n\nFirst row [2,2,2] is uniform. So first row remains. Subsequent rows: elements not equal to 2 become 5. Which matches the output.\n\nExample1:\n\nFirst row [1,1,1] uniform. Subsequent rows: elements not 1 become 5. Which matches.\n\nExample2:\n\nFirst row uniform. Other rows: elements not 2 \u2192 5. Second row [8,8,2] becomes [5,5,2] \u2192 third element is 2, so remains. Third row is uniform [2,2,2] \u2192 remains. Correct.\n\nExample3:\n\nFirst row [3,3,8] is not uniform. So first row becomes all 5s. Subsequent rows:\n\nSecond row [4,4,4] is uniform \u2192 remains. Third row [8,1,1] is not uniform \u2192 becomes all 5s. Which matches the output.\n\nYes, this seems to fit all the examples.\n\nNow, applying this pattern to the test input:\n\nTest Input:\n\n[1,3,2]\n\n[3,3,2]\n\n[1,3,2]\n\nFirst row is [1,3,2]. Is this uniform? No, because elements are 1,3,2. So first row is not uniform. Therefore, first row becomes all 5s. Then, for the other rows:\n\nSecond row [3,3,2]. Is this uniform? No. So all elements become 5. Third row [1,3,2] \u2192 also not uniform, becomes all 5s.\n\nSo the output should be:\n\n[5,5,5]\n\n[5,5,5]\n\n[5,5,5]\n\nWait, but let's double-check. Since the first row is not uniform, all elements in the first row become 5. Then, for each subsequent row, check if the row is uniform. The second row is [3,3,2]. Not uniform (elements 3,3,2). So the entire row becomes 5s. Third row [1,3,2] \u2192 not uniform \u2192 5s. So the output is all 5s for each row. But let's check if there's any exception.\n\nWait, example3's third row [8,1,1] is not uniform and becomes all 5s, which aligns with this rule.\n\nSo the test input's output should be three rows of [5,5,5].",

        "cot_2": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. So, we have these input grids and output grids. Let me look at the training examples one by one.\n\nStarting with Example 0:\nInput:\n[2, 2, 2]\n[2, 1, 8]\n[2, 8, 8]\n\nOutput:\n[2, 2, 2]\n[2, 5, 5]\n[2, 5, 5]\n\nHmm. The first row remains the same. The second row starts with 2, then 1 and 8 become 5 and 5. The third row was 2,8,8 and becomes 2,5,5. Wait, but the first element in the third row was 2 and stayed 2. So maybe the 8s are being replaced by 5s? But in the second row, the 1 and 8 became 5s. Wait, maybe it's not just 8s. Let's check other examples.\n\nExample 1:\nInput:\n[1,1,1]\n[8,1,3]\n[8,2,2]\n\nOutput:\n[1,1,1]\n[5,1,5]\n[5,5,5]\n\nHere, the first row stays the same again. The second row: 8 becomes 5, 1 stays, 3 becomes 5. Third row: 8 becomes 5, 2 and 2 become 5. Wait, but in the third row, 2s are turned into 5s. That's different from the first example where some 2s stayed. Hmm. Maybe it's about the rows that are adjacent to the first and last rows?\n\nWait, let's look at Example 2:\n\nInput:\n[2,2,2]\n[8,8,2]\n[2,2,2]\n\nOutput:\n[2,2,2]\n[5,5,2]\n[2,2,2]\n\nHere, the first and third rows are the same. The middle row's 8s become 5s, but the 2 remains. So the first and last rows are unchanged. The middle rows have some changes. So maybe the middle rows (not the first or last) are transformed? Or perhaps it's about the rows that are not all the same as the first row?\n\nWait, in Example 0, the first row is all 2s. The middle row has a 2,1,8. The third row starts with 2. The output for the middle and third rows have 5s replacing some numbers.\n\nWait, maybe the rule is that any row that is not the same as the first row gets transformed. Let's check that.\n\nIn Example 0, the first row is [2,2,2]. The second and third rows are different. In the output, the second and third rows are modified. The first row stays the same.\n\nIn Example 1, the first row is [1,1,1]. The second and third rows are different. The outputs for those rows are modified. The third row becomes all 5s except maybe the first element? Wait, in Example 1's third input row, [8,2,2], the output is [5,5,5]. So all elements are replaced with 5.\n\nBut in Example 0, the third input row is [2,8,8], which becomes [2,5,5]. So the first element is 2 (same as first row's elements) and the others are 8s turned to 5s. So perhaps the elements in the rows that are not matching the first row's elements get replaced by 5, except for the elements that are same as the first row.\n\nWait, in Example 0's third row: [2,8,8]. The first element is 2, same as the first row's 2, so it remains. The 8s are different, so they become 5. Similarly, in Example 1's third row: [8,2,2]. The first element is 8, which is different from the first row's 1, so becomes 5. The 2s are also different from 1, so they become 5s. So maybe, for any row that is not identical to the first row, each element in that row is replaced by 5 if it's not equal to the corresponding element in the first row. Wait, but that might not fit.\n\nWait, let's take Example 0's second input row: [2,1,8]. The first row is [2,2,2]. So the first element is 2 (matches first row's first element), so remains. The second element is 1, which is not equal to the first row's second element (2), so becomes 5. The third element is 8, which is not equal to 2 (first row's third element), so becomes 5. So the output row is [2,5,5].\n\nSimilarly, the third input row in Example 0 is [2,8,8]. The first element matches first row's 2, so stays. The other elements (8,8) do not match 2, so become 5s. Output is [2,5,5].\n\nIn Example 1, the first row is [1,1,1]. The second input row is [8,1,3]. Comparing each element to the first row's:\n\n8 vs 1 (different) \u2192 5.\n\n1 vs 1 (same) \u2192 remains.\n\n3 vs 1 (different) \u2192 5. So output is [5,1,5].\n\nThird row input: [8,2,2]. All elements are different from first row's 1 \u2192 all become 5. Output is [5,5,5].\n\nExample 2's input: first row is [2,2,2]. Second input row is [8,8,2]. Compare each element:\n\n8 vs 2 \u2192 5.\n\n8 vs 2 \u2192 5.\n\n2 vs 2 \u2192 stays. So output is [5,5,2]. Third row is [2,2,2], same as first, so remains.\n\nExample 3's input:\n\n[3,3,8]\n\n[4,4,4]\n\n[8,1,1]\n\nOutput:\n\n[5,5,5]\n\n[4,4,4]\n\n[5,5,5]\n\nWait, the first row in input is [3,3,8], but the output is [5,5,5]. That's different from previous examples where the first row stayed the same. Oh wait, but in Example 3's output, the first row is transformed. So maybe the first row isn't always kept? Hmm, this complicates things. Let me check.\n\nWait, in Example 3's input, the first row is [3,3,8], and the output's first row is [5,5,5]. So the first row is being transformed. So previous pattern where first row is kept doesn't hold here. So maybe there's a different pattern.\n\nLooking at the other rows in Example 3:\n\nThe second input row is [4,4,4], which becomes the same in output. So perhaps if a row is all the same elements, it remains. The third input row is [8,1,1], which becomes [5,5,5]. But why is the first row changed here?\n\nWait, in Example 3's output, the first and third rows are all 5s, and the middle row remains as [4,4,4]. The input's first row is [3,3,8]. So maybe the pattern is that any row that is not all the same element is converted to all 5s, and rows that are all same elements are left as is. Let's check.\n\nIn Example 0's input:\n\nFirst row is all 2s \u2192 output remains.\n\nSecond row is [2,1,8] \u2192 not all same \u2192 becomes [2,5,5] (but first element is 2, same as first row's first element. Hmm, this complicates.)\n\nWait, maybe that's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe all rows except those that are all the same are transformed. But in Example 3's first row, [3,3,8] is not all same, so transformed to all 5s. The third row [8,1,1] is not all same \u2192 transformed to 5s. The middle row [4,4,4] is all same \u2192 remains.\n\nIn Example 0's input, first row is all same \u2192 remains. Second row [2,1,8] not same \u2192 transformed. Third row [2,8,8] not same \u2192 transformed. But in Example 0's output, the transformed rows are [2,5,5] and [2,5,5]. So the first element is kept as 2. So maybe the transformation is that, in any row that is not all same elements, each element is replaced by 5 unless it matches the first element of the first row.\n\nWait, let's test this. First row's first element is 2 in Example 0. So in the other rows, any element that's 2 is kept, others replaced by 5. Let's see:\n\nSecond input row in Example 0: [2,1,8]. The first element is 2 (matches first row's first element), so kept. 1 and 8 are not \u2192 5. Output [2,5,5]. Third row: [2,8,8] \u2192 2 kept, others 5.\n\nIn Example 1, first row is [1,1,1]. First element is 1. The second input row is [8,1,3]. 8 is not 1 \u2192 5. 1 is 1 \u2192 kept. 3 \u2192 5. So output [5,1,5]. Third row [8,2,2] \u2192 8, 2, 2 are not 1 \u2192 all 5s.\n\nExample 2: first element is 2. Second input row [8,8,2]. 8s become 5, 2 stays. Third row is all 2s \u2192 remains.\n\nExample 3: first row's first element is 3. But the output for first row is all 5s. Wait, this contradicts the hypothesis. Because in Example 3's input, the first row is [3,3,8]. The first element is 3. If the rule is to replace elements not equal to first element of first row with 5, then the first row's elements would be 3 \u2192 3, 3 \u21923, 8 \u21925. So the first row's output should be [3,3,5]. But the actual output is [5,5,5]. So that doesn't fit. So maybe the hypothesis is wrong.\n\nAlternative approach: Let's look at the outputs. The 5s seem to appear whenever there's a number that is not part of a uniform row. Wait, in Example 3, the first and third rows in input are not uniform (first has 3,3,8; third has 8,1,1), so they become all 5s. The middle row is uniform (4s) and stays. So maybe the rule is: for each row in the input, if all elements are the same, leave as is. Otherwise, replace the entire row with all 5s. But wait, in Example 0, the second row is [2,1,8], which is not uniform. But the output is [2,5,5], not all 5s. So this contradicts that.\n\nHmm. So maybe the transformation is more complex.\n\nLooking at Example 3 again. Input rows:\n\n[3,3,8] \u2192 output [5,5,5]\n\n[4,4,4] \u2192 stays\n\n[8,1,1] \u2192 [5,5,5]\n\nSo here, non-uniform rows become all 5s, regardless of their elements.\n\nBut in Example 0, the second row [2,1,8] becomes [2,5,5], not all 5s. So why is the first element kept?\n\nWait, perhaps it's not about the entire row. Maybe in the rows that are not the first or last, but adjacent to a uniform row, they are modified differently.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the first row's elements determine which elements are kept. For example, in Example 0, the first row is all 2s. For other rows, elements that are 2 are kept, others replaced with 5. So in the second row [2,1,8], 2 stays, others become 5. Third row [2,8,8]: 2 stays, others 5. That's what happened in Example 0.\n\nIn Example 1, first row is all 1s. So in other rows, elements that are 1 stay, others become 5. Second row [8,1,3] \u2192 8\u21925, 1 stays, 3\u21925. Third row [8,2,2] \u2192 all non-1 \u2192 5. So output [5,5,5].\n\nExample 2: first row is all 2s. Second row [8,8,2] \u2192 8s become 5, 2 stays. Third row is all 2s \u2192 stays.\n\nBut then Example 3's input is:\n\nFirst row [3,3,8] \u2192 output [5,5,5]. So according to the previous rule, since first row is not uniform (since third element is 8), how does that affect?\n\nWait, maybe the rule is different. Let's think again: the first row is considered a reference. All elements in other rows that match the first row's corresponding column are kept; others are replaced by 5.\n\nWait, let's check.\n\nFor Example 0:\n\nFirst row is [2,2,2]. So for any other row, each element must match the corresponding column's element in the first row. For the second row [2,1,8], first element matches 2 (so stays 2). Second element is 1 vs 2 \u2192 5. Third element 8 vs 2 \u21925. So output [2,5,5].\n\nThird row [2,8,8]: first element 2 (matches first row's first 2 \u2192 stays). Second and third elements (8,8) don't match first row's 2 \u2192 5. So output [2,5,5].\n\nExample 1:\n\nFirst row [1,1,1]. Second row [8,1,3]. Columns:\n\nFirst column: 8 vs 1 \u21925. Second: 1 vs1 \u21921. Third:3 vs1 \u21925. Output [5,1,5].\n\nThird row [8,2,2]. All columns: 8 vs1 \u21925. 2 vs1 \u21925. 2 vs1 \u21925. So all 5s.\n\nExample 2:\n\nFirst row [2,2,2]. Second row [8,8,2]. Columns:\n\n8 vs2 \u21925. 8 vs2 \u21925. 2 vs2 \u21922. Output [5,5,2]. Third row is same as first \u2192 remains.\n\nExample 3:\n\nFirst row is [3,3,8]. So columns are 3,3,8.\n\nNow, let's look at the output for Example 3. First row in output is [5,5,5]. So according to the previous rule, all elements in the first row must not match the first row's columns? Wait, that can't be. Because the first row is being transformed here, which wasn't the case in previous examples.\n\nWait, this suggests that the previous pattern doesn't apply here. So maybe the rule is different when the first row is not uniform.\n\nIn Example 3's input, the first row is [3,3,8], which is not uniform. The output for the first row is [5,5,5]. The middle row is [4,4,4] (uniform), so remains. Third row [8,1,1] \u2192 transformed to all 5s.\n\nSo maybe the rule is: If a row is uniform (all elements same), it stays. If not, replace all elements with 5. But then why in Example 0, the second row [2,1,8] (non-uniform) becomes [2,5,5], not all 5s. So that's conflicting.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is: If a row is uniform, leave it. If not, for each element in that row, if it's equal to the first element of the first row, leave it; else, replace with 5. But then in Example 3's first row, which is [3,3,8], if the first element is 3. Then first element 3 \u2192 stays. Second element 3 \u2192 same as first element \u2192 stays. Third element 8 \u2192 not \u21925. So first row output should be [3,3,5]. But actual output is [5,5,5]. So that doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. This is tricky. Let's re-express the problem again.\n\nLooking at all the examples:\n\nThe outputs have 5s appearing in non-uniform rows. But sometimes elements are kept. So perhaps the pattern is that for any row that is not uniform, each element is replaced by 5 unless it is the same as the first element of its row.\n\nWait, in Example 0's second row: [2,1,8]. First element is 2. So elements are replaced with 5 except if they are 2. So output [2,5,5]. Third row [2,8,8] \u2192 same: 2 stays, others 5. That fits.\n\nExample 1's second row [8,1,3]. First element is 8. So elements are replaced by 5 unless they are 8. But the output is [5,1,5]. Wait, this doesn't fit. Because the second element is 1, which is not 8, but it's kept as 1. So that contradicts.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's the first element of the entire grid. Let's look:\n\nIn Example 0, the grid's first row is [2,2,2], so first element is 2. So for any row not uniform, replace elements that are not 2 with 5. So:\n\nSecond row [2,1,8]. 2 is kept. 1 and 8 become 5. Third row [2,8,8]: 2 stays, others become 5. That fits.\n\nExample 1's grid first element is 1. So for non-uniform rows, elements not equal to 1 become 5. Second row [8,1,3]: 8\u21925, 1 stays, 3\u21925. Third row [8,2,2] \u2192 all elements not 1 \u21925. So output [5,5,5].\n\nExample 2's first element is 2. Second row [8,8,2]. 8s become 5, 2 stays. Third row is uniform \u2192 stays.\n\nExample 3's first element of the grid is 3. So for non-uniform rows, elements not equal to 3 become 5. But in Example 3's input:\n\nFirst row [3,3,8] is not uniform. So elements not 3 \u2192 replace with 5. So third element 8 becomes 5. So output row should be [3,3,5]. But the actual output is [5,5,5]. So this contradicts.\n\nWait, so this suggests that the rule is different when the row is the first row. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the first row is treated differently. Like, if the first row is not uniform, it's entirely replaced with 5s. Then for other rows, replace elements not equal to the first element of the first row with 5.\n\nIn Example 3:\n\nFirst row is [3,3,8] \u2192 not uniform \u2192 replaced with 5s. So output first row [5,5,5]. Middle row is uniform \u2192 stays. Third row [8,1,1] \u2192 elements not equal to first element of first row (3) \u2192 8,1,1 are not 3 \u2192 all become 5.\n\nBut according to this, the third row's output would be [5,5,5], which matches the example. So let's check other examples.\n\nExample 0: first row is uniform [2,2,2]. So no change. Other rows: replace elements not 2 with 5. Which matches.\n\nExample 1: first row uniform [1,1,1]. Other rows replace elements not 1 with 5. Which matches.\n\nExample 2: first row uniform. Middle row elements not 2 \u2192 5. Third row uniform \u2192 stays.\n\nExample 3: first row not uniform \u2192 replaced with 5s. Other rows: elements not 3 (the first element of first row) are replaced with 5. So middle row is [4,4,4]. 4 is not 3 \u2192 replaced with 5. But in the actual output, the middle row remains [4,4,4]. So this contradicts.\n\nAh, so this hypothesis is incorrect.\n\nWait, but in Example 3's output, the middle row is [4,4,4], which is uniform. So maybe the rule is:\n\n- Any uniform row (all elements same) is kept as is.\n\n- Any non-uniform row is replaced with all 5s.\n\nBut in Example 0's second row [2,1,8], which is non-uniform, but the output is [2,5,5], not all 5s. So this contradicts.\n\nAlternative approach: Let's look for another pattern. Maybe the 5s are replacing numbers that are not part of the majority in their row or something. But in Example 0's second row, majority is 2? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 5s are replacing numbers that are not present in the first row. Let's check.\n\nExample 0 first row has 2s. So in other rows, any number not 2 is replaced by 5. So second row [2,1,8] \u2192 1 and 8 become 5. Output [2,5,5]. Third row [2,8,8] \u2192 8s become 5. Output [2,5,5]. That works.\n\nExample 1 first row is all 1s. Other rows: numbers not 1 become 5. Second row [8,1,3] \u2192 8 and 3 become 5. Output [5,1,5]. Third row [8,2,2] \u2192 all not 1 \u21925s. Output [5,5,5]. That fits.\n\nExample 2 first row all 2s. Second row has 8 and 8 and 2. Numbers not 2 become 5. Output [5,5,2]. Third row all 2s \u2192 stays.\n\nExample 3 first row has 3,3,8. So numbers present are 3 and 8. Any numbers not in first row (3,8) should be replaced by 5. Wait, the first row's elements are 3,3,8. So other rows:\n\nMiddle row [4,4,4] \u2192 4 is not in first row \u2192 replaced with 5. But in output, middle row is [4,4,4]. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the first row's elements are considered. If any element in other rows is not present in the first row, it is replaced with 5.\n\nIn Example 3's input:\n\nFirst row has elements 3,8. So in other rows:\n\nMiddle row [4,4,4]: 4 is not in first row \u2192 replace with 5. But output is [4,4,4]. So this contradicts.\n\nHmm. Maybe the rule is that for non-uniform rows, replace elements that are not present in the first row with 5. But Example 0's first row is all 2s. So other rows: elements not 2 \u2192 replaced. Which fits. Example 1's first row is 1s. Other rows: elements not 1 \u2192 replaced. Example 2's first row 2s. Other rows: elements not 2 \u2192 replaced. Example 3's first row has 3,3,8. So in other rows, elements not 3 or 8 are replaced. Middle row [4,4,4]: all 4s, not in first row \u2192 replaced. But output remains. So this doesn't fit.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Let's think differently. The 5s seem to appear in positions where the element is different from the first row's element in that column. Except in Example 3, where the first row itself is transformed.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is:\n\n- For each row after the first, any element that is not equal to the element above it (from the first row) is replaced with 5.\n\nBut in Example 0:\n\nFirst row is [2,2,2].\n\nSecond row [2,1,8]. Compare each element with the first row's:\n\n2 == 2 \u2192 stay.\n\n1 !=2 \u2192 5.\n\n8 !=2 \u21925.\n\nSo output [2,5,5].\n\nThird row [2,8,8]. Compare with first row:\n\n2 ==2 \u2192 stay.\n\n8 !=2 \u21925.\n\n8 !=2 \u21925.\n\nOutput [2,5,5].\n\nThat fits.\n\nExample 1:\n\nFirst row [1,1,1].\n\nSecond row [8,1,3]:\n\n8 !=1 \u21925.\n\n1 ==1 \u21921.\n\n3 !=1 \u21925.\n\nOutput [5,1,5].\n\nThird row [8,2,2]:\n\nAll elements !=1 \u21925s.\n\nOutput [5,5,5].\n\nExample 2:\n\nFirst row [2,2,2].\n\nSecond row [8,8,2]:\n\n8 !=2 \u21925.\n\n8 !=2 \u21925.\n\n2 ==2 \u21922.\n\nOutput [5,5,2].\n\nThird row [2,2,2] same as first \u2192 stays.\n\nExample 3:\n\nFirst row [3,3,8].\n\nSecond row [4,4,4]. Compare each element with first row's:\n\n4 vs3 \u21925.\n\n4 vs3 \u21925.\n\n4 vs8 \u21925.\n\nBut output is [4,4,4]. Hmm, this doesn't fit.\n\nWait, no. In Example 3's output, the second row remains [4,4,4]. So according to this rule, this would be replaced with [5,5,5]. But the actual output is [4,4,4]. So this contradicts.\n\nSo maybe the rule is different. Let's see:\n\nIn Example 3's input, the second row is [4,4,4]. Output is the same. So perhaps rows that are uniform (all elements same) are kept as is. For non-uniform rows, replace elements that differ from the first row's corresponding column with 5. But then in Example 3's first row, which is [3,3,8], which is not uniform. So according to this rule, it's a non-uniform row. So in the output, the first row's elements would be replaced if they differ from the first row's elements. But that's circular.\n\nAlternatively, the first row is treated as a reference. For each element in any row, if it matches the first row's corresponding column, it's kept; else, replaced with 5. Except if the row is uniform. But Example 3's second row is uniform, so it's kept. Let's check:\n\nExample 3's input:\n\nRow 1: [3,3,8] (non-uniform) \u2192 compare each element with first row (itself). Since it's the first row, maybe it's transformed if not uniform. But in output, it's replaced with [5,5,5]. So maybe the rule is:\n\n- If a row is uniform, keep it.\n\n- If a row is not uniform, replace each element with 5 unless the entire grid's first row is uniform. Then, in non-uniform rows, replace elements not matching the first row's corresponding column with 5.\n\nBut this is getting convoluted. Let's try to re-examine Example 3. The first row is [3,3,8], which is not uniform. The output changes it to [5,5,5]. The middle row is uniform and stays. Third row is [8,1,1], which is not uniform. So output is [5,5,5]. So perhaps whenever a row is not uniform, replace it with all 5s. But in other examples, like Example 0's second and third rows, they are not uniform but only some elements are replaced. So this doesn't hold.\n\nHmm. What's the commonality between all the output rows that have 5s?\n\nLooking at all outputs, the 5s appear when:\n\n- The element in the input is not the same as the first element of the first row, except when the row is uniform.\n\nWait, let's check:\n\nExample 0's first row first element is 2. In other rows, elements not 2 become 5. Except for the first element of each row if it matches 2. Wait, no. Because in Example 0's third row, the first element is 2 and it's kept.\n\nBut in Example 3's first row, the first element is 3. The entire row is transformed to 5s, even though the first element was 3. So that contradicts.\n\nAlternatively, the first row is only treated as reference if it's uniform. If it's not uniform, then all non-uniform rows (including the first) are replaced with 5s. And uniform rows stay. Let's see:\n\nIn Example 0, first row is uniform. So other rows' elements not matching the first row's elements are replaced with 5.\n\nExample 3's first row is not uniform. So all non-uniform rows (including itself) are replaced with 5s. Uniform rows stay. So:\n\nExample 3's first row is not uniform \u2192 replaced with 5s. Middle row is uniform \u2192 stays. Third row not uniform \u2192 replaced with 5s.\n\nThis fits. So the rule would be:\n\n- If the first row is uniform, then for all other rows, elements not matching the first row's corresponding column are replaced with 5.\n\n- If the first row is not uniform, then all rows that are not uniform are replaced with all 5s, and uniform rows are kept.\n\nBut how does this apply to other examples?\n\nExample 0: first row uniform. So other rows' elements not matching first row's columns are replaced with 5. Correct.\n\nExample 1: first row uniform. So other rows' elements not matching first row's columns (all 1s) are replaced with 5. Correct.\n\nExample 2: first row uniform. Other rows' elements not 2 become 5. Correct.\n\nExample 3: first row not uniform. So all non-uniform rows (including first) become 5s. Uniform rows (middle row [4,4,4]) stay. Correct.\n\nTest Input:\n\n[1,3,2]\n\n[3,3,2]\n\n[1,3,2]\n\nFirst row is [1,3,2]. Is this uniform? No, elements are 1,3,2 \u2192 different. So according to the rule, since first row is not uniform, all non-uniform rows are replaced with all 5s. Uniform rows are kept.\n\nNow, check each row:\n\nFirst row: not uniform \u2192 replaced with [5,5,5].\n\nSecond row: [3,3,2]. Is this uniform? No, elements are 3,3,2 \u2192 third element is 2. So non-uniform \u2192 replaced with [5,5,5].\n\nThird row: [1,3,2]. Same as first row \u2192 not uniform \u2192 replaced with [5,5,5].\n\nBut wait, the test input has three rows. First and third are same and non-uniform. Middle row is [3,3,2], which is not uniform. So all three rows are non-uniform and should be replaced with 5s. So output would be three rows of [5,5,5].\n\nBut let's check the training examples for when first row is non-uniform.\n\nExample 3's input first row is non-uniform. Output first row is all 5s. Middle row is uniform \u2192 stays. Third row is non-uniform \u2192 all 5s.\n\nIn the test case, all three rows are non-uniform. So according to the rule, they should all be replaced with 5s. But let's check the test input again:\n\nTest Input:\n\n[1,3,2]\n\n[3,3,2]\n\n[1,3,2]\n\nFirst row is not uniform. So all non-uniform rows become 5s. So the output would be:\n\n[5,5,5]\n\n[5,5,5]\n\n[5,5,5]\n\nBut let's see if there's any possibility that the middle row is uniform. The middle row is [3,3,2]. Not uniform. So yes, all three rows are non-uniform \u2192 replaced with 5s.\n\nBut maybe there's another angle. Wait, the first row in the test input is [1,3,2]. The third row is the same as the first. So perhaps the third row is uniform with the first row? But no, uniformity requires all elements in the row to be the same. So if the first and third rows are the same but not uniform, each is non-uniform.\n\nSo applying the rule, the output would be three rows of [5,5,5].\n\nBut looking back at the training examples, when the first row is not uniform (Example 3), the output for the first and third rows are all 5s. The middle row, if uniform, remains. So the same applies here.\n\nBut in the test input, all three rows are non-uniform. So all are replaced with 5s.\n\nSo the expected output would be three rows of [5,5,5].\n\nBut let's check the training examples again for any possible variations.\n\nWait, in Example 3's input, the middle row is uniform and thus stays. So the rule holds.\n\nIn the test case, all rows are non-uniform \u2192 all become 5s.\n\nSo the output should be:\n\n[5,5,5]\n\n[5,5,5]\n\n[5,5,5]\n\nBut let's see another possibility. Maybe when the first row is non-uniform, then all rows are replaced with 5s, regardless of uniformity. But Example 3's middle row is uniform and stays. So that's not the case.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be three rows of 5s."
