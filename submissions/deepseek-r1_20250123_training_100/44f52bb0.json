        "cot_1": "Okay, let's tackle this puzzle. So, the task is to figure out the pattern that transforms the given 3x3 grids into the corresponding output numbers. Let me look through the training examples to find a common rule.\n\nStarting with Example 0:\nInput:\n[2, 0, 2]\n[0, 2, 0]\n[2, 0, 2]\nOutput: [1]\nHmm, looking at the grid, maybe there's symmetry involved. This grid looks like it has a central symmetry. The middle element is 2, and the corners and edges might form a pattern.\n\nExample 1:\nInput:\n[2, 0, 0]\n[2, 0, 0]\n[0, 2, 0]\nOutput: [7]\nThis grid doesn't seem symmetrical. Let me count the number of 2s. There are three 2s here. Wait, but example 0 had five 2s. So maybe the count isn't directly related. Alternatively, maybe the positions of the 2s matter.\n\nExample 2:\nInput is all 2s except the middle of each row. Output is [1]. Wait, no, the input here is all rows as [2,0,2]. So each row starts and ends with 2. Output is 1 again. So maybe when the grid has a certain pattern of 2s arranged symmetrically, the output is 1.\n\nExample 3:\nInput has middle row as [2,0,2], others are all zeros. Output is 1. So maybe if there's a horizontal line of 2s in the middle, it's 1.\n\nWait, but example 0's middle row is [0,2,0], but the output is 1. Hmm. So maybe the pattern isn't just the middle row. Let's think differently.\n\nLooking at the outputs: 1 and 7. Maybe binary numbers? 1 is 1 in binary, 7 is 111. But how does the grid relate to that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's the number of 'islands' of 2s. Like in example 0, the 2s form a cross, which is one connected region. So output 1. Example 1: the 2s are in positions (0,0), (1,0), (2,1). Are these connected? The (0,0) is adjacent to (1,0), which is adjacent to (2,1) diagonally? Maybe if they're connected via any direction, including diagonally. Then example1's 2s form a single connected region, but output is 7. Hmm, that doesn't fit. So maybe not islands.\n\nAnother approach: maybe the output is based on the positions of the 2s as representing a seven-segment display. For instance, the numbers 1 and 7. Let's see.\n\nIn a seven-segment display:\n- 1 uses the right two vertical segments.\n- 7 uses the top, upper right, and middle segments.\n\nIf each cell in the 3x3 grid corresponds to a segment in the seven-segment display. Let's map the grid positions to segments. Let's imagine the grid as:\n\nRow 0: top row (segments a, b, c)\nRow 1: middle row (segments d, e, f)\nRow 2: bottom row (segments g, h, i)\nWait, but maybe the standard seven-segment has segments labeled a to g. Let me recall:\n\nStandard seven-segment layout:\n\n a \nf b\n g \ne c\n d \n\nBut maybe the grid is arranged differently. Alternatively, perhaps the grid is arranged as a 3x3 grid where each cell represents a part of the segments. For example, the seven-segment digits can be represented in a 3x3 grid where certain cells are lit (2) to form the number.\n\nLooking up how a seven-segment display could be represented in a 3x3 grid. For example:\n\nNumber 1 would light the right vertical segments (positions (0,2), (1,2), (2,2)).\n\nNumber 7 would light the top horizontal (0,0-2), the middle horizontal (1,0-2?), and the upper right (maybe). Wait, maybe not exactly. Let me visualize.\n\nIn a 3x3 grid, the segments for numbers:\n\n- 1: right column (0,2), (1,2), (2,2).\n- 7: top row (0,0), (0,1), (0,2); middle row (1,1); right column (2,2)? Wait, that might not match exactly. Alternatively:\n\nLooking at Example 0's input:\n\n[2,0,2]\n[0,2,0]\n[2,0,2]\n\nIf this represents a cross shape (like a plus sign), which could correspond to the number 1 in some seven-segment representation. But standard seven-segment 1 is just two vertical segments. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the number of 2s in certain positions. For instance, example 0 has five 2s, output 1. Example 1 has three 2s, output 7. Example2 has six 2s (each row starts and ends with 2, so three rows with two 2s each: 3*2=6?), output 1. But example 3 has two 2s (middle row), output 1. So the count doesn't align directly.\n\nAnother thought: maybe the sum of the positions. But 2s are either 0 or 2, but the sum might be 2 * number of 2s. Example0: 5*2=10 \u2192 output 1? Example1: 3*2=6 \u2192 output7. Doesn't make sense.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's about the positions of 2s forming a certain shape that corresponds to the number. For example, a vertical line in the middle would be 1, and a horizontal line at the top plus a diagonal for 7.\n\nLooking at example1's input:\n\nRow0: [2,0,0]\nRow1: [2,0,0]\nRow2: [0,2,0]\n\nThe 2s are in (0,0), (1,0), (2,1). If we plot these, they form a kind of diagonal from the top-left corner to the middle-right, which might look like a 7. Let's imagine the 3x3 grid as a seven-segment display where:\n\n- The top row is the top segment.\n- The middle row's middle element is the center segment.\n- The right column is the right vertical segments.\n- The left column is the left vertical.\n- The bottom row is the bottom segment.\n\nSo for 7, the top, upper right, and middle segments are on. Wait, in a seven-segment display, 7 is top, upper right, and middle. So maybe in the grid:\n\nTop row (0,0,0,0,1,0,0,2) being 2s would correspond to the top segment. The middle row's middle (1,1) being 2 for the middle segment, and the right column (0,2, 1,2, 2,2) for the upper right.\n\nBut example1's grid doesn't have (0,2) as 2. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the positions are arranged differently.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is determined by the sum of certain cells multiplied by a factor, but the outputs are 1 and 7, which are small numbers. So perhaps it's a binary encoding. Let's see:\n\nLooking at example0's output is 1. The grid has 2s in positions that form a cross. Maybe the cross is the number 1. Then, perhaps when the 2s form a cross (like the middle row and column), output is 1. Let's check other examples.\n\nExample3's input is:\n\n[0,0,0]\n[2,0,2]\n[0,0,0]\n\nWait, the middle row has 2s at the ends. But that's not a cross. But output is 1. Hmm, maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the cross is the middle cell and the four corners. But in example0, the middle cell is 2, and the four corners are 2. So that's a cross. Output is 1. Example3's middle row has two 2s, but the corners are 0. So maybe that's a different pattern. So that theory might not hold.\n\nLooking at example4's input:\n\n[2,2,0]\n[0,2,2]\n[0,0,0]\n\nThe 2s are in (0,0), (0,1), (1,1), (1,2). Output is 7. So this forms a sort of diagonal line and another part. Maybe this represents the segments of 7. If the top row has two 2s, maybe the top and middle-right segments are lit.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is 7 when there are three 2s arranged in an L-shape. Wait example1 has three 2s: (0,0), (1,0), (2,1). That's like a vertical line and a step to the right. Maybe that's an L-shape. Example4's input has four 2s, but output is 7, so that's not matching.\n\nAlternatively, think of the grid as a binary matrix where 2 is 1 and 0 is 0. Then converting the 3x3 grid into a 9-bit binary number, but the outputs are 1 and 7. Let's check:\n\nFor example0:\n\nThe grid is:\n1 (2) 0 1\n0 1 0\n1 0 1\n\nAssuming 2 is 1. So binary digits would be 101 010 101. If we read this row-wise, as 101010101, which is 341 in decimal. But output is 1. So that's not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the positions where 2 is present form a binary number. For example, the grid has certain positions considered as bits.\n\nWait, the output is either 1 or 7, which are 3-bit numbers (001 and 111). So maybe the first three 2s in some order. But the examples don't seem to align with that.\n\nAnother approach: look for the difference between outputs 1 and 7. All examples with output 1 have certain properties, and 7 others.\n\nLooking at example0: cross shape (middle and corners?), output 1.\n\nExample1: output7, and the 2s are in (0,0), (1,0), (2,1). Maybe this forms a 7 shape.\n\nExample2: all rows are [2,0,2]. So three rows each with 2s at the ends. Output is 1. So maybe when the 2s form vertical lines on the left and right, but that's 2 vertical lines, but output is 1. That's confusing.\n\nExample3: middle row has 2s at ends, others are 0. Output1.\n\nHmm. Maybe the key is the number of 2s in the middle row. Let's check:\n\nExample0: middle row has 1 (the center) \u2192 output1.\n\nExample1: middle row has 0 in the center \u2192 output7.\n\nExample2: middle row has 0 \u2192 output1. Wait no, example2's middle row is [2,0,2], so two 2s. Output1. Hmm, that contradicts.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the presence of 2s in the corners. Example0 has all four corners as 2. Output1. Example3's middle row has two 2s (but not corners of the grid). Example4's corners are (0,0)=2, (0,2)=0, (2,0)=0, (2,2)=0. Output7. So perhaps when the four corners are 2s, it's output1. But example2's corners are all 2s (since each row starts and ends with 2), so yes. Example2's output is 1. Example5's input has first row [2,2,0], so corners (0,0)=2 and (0,2)=0. So output7. So maybe if all four corners are 2, output is1. Otherwise, output7.\n\nLet me check:\n\nExample0: all four corners (0,0)=2, (0,2)=2, (2,0)=2, (2,2)=2 \u2192 yes \u2192 output1.\n\nExample1: corners (0,0)=2, (0,2)=0, (2,0)=0, (2,2)=0 \u2192 not all \u2192 output7.\n\nExample2: all corners 2 \u2192 output1.\n\nExample3: corners are all 0 except (maybe middle row's ends, but grid corners are (0,0), (0,2), (2,0), (2,2) \u2192 all 0 except middle row's ends are 2, but those are not grid corners. So example3's grid corners are 0 \u2192 output1. But according to the previous idea, since corners are not all 2, output should be7. But in example3, output is1. So this theory is invalid.\n\nHmm. So example3's output is1 despite not having all four corners as 2. So that pattern doesn't hold.\n\nAlternative approach: let's check if the output is 1 when the grid is symmetric in some way. For example, Example0: symmetric vertically and horizontally. Example2: each row is same, symmetric. Example3: symmetric along the middle row. So when symmetry exists, output1. If not, output7.\n\nExample1: input is not symmetric \u2192 output7. Example4: input is [2,2,0], [0,2,2], [0,0,0]. Let's see:\n\nRow0: [2,2,0]\nRow1: [0,2,2]\nRow2: [0,0,0]\n\nIf we flip horizontally, row0 becomes [0,2,2], which is row1. So not symmetric. So output7. Example5: [2,2,0], [0,2,0], [0,0,0]. Not symmetric \u2192 output7.\n\nSo maybe symmetry (either vertical, horizontal, or rotational) leads to output1. Let's check all examples.\n\nExample0: symmetric in all directions \u2192 output1.\n\nExample1: not symmetric \u21927.\n\nExample2: each row is same \u2192 symmetric \u2192 output1.\n\nExample3: middle row is [2,0,2], others are all zeros. So vertical symmetry? If you mirror along the middle column, yes. Because rows are all zeros except middle row which is symmetric. So yes, symmetric \u2192 output1.\n\nExample4: input is not symmetric \u2192 output7.\n\nExample5: input is not symmetric \u2192 output7.\n\nSo this seems to fit. The pattern is: if the 3x3 grid has any kind of symmetry (vertical, horizontal, or rotational), output [1]. Otherwise, output [7].\n\nNow, applying this to the test input:\n\nTest input:\n\n[2,0,2]\n\n[2,2,2]\n\n[2,0,2]\n\nLet's check for symmetry.\n\nLooking at rows:\n\nRow0: 2,0,2.\n\nRow1: 2,2,2.\n\nRow2: 2,0,2.\n\nCheck vertical symmetry (left-right mirror). Each row should be the same when reversed. Row0 reversed is 2,0,2 \u2192 same. Row1 reversed is 2,2,2 \u2192 same. Row2 reversed is same as row0. So vertically symmetric.\n\nAlso, check horizontal symmetry (up-down mirror). Rows 0 and 2 are the same, so mirroring rows would leave the grid the same. So yes, horizontally symmetric.\n\nTherefore, this grid is symmetric in both vertical and horizontal directions. So according to the pattern, the output should be [1].",

        "cot_2": "Okay, let's tackle this puzzle. So, the task is to figure out the pattern that transforms the given 3x3 grids into the output numbers. The examples show various grids with outputs of either 1 or 7. Let's look at them one by one to see if I can spot a pattern.\n\nStarting with Example 0:\nInput is:\n[2,0,2]\n[0,2,0]\n[2,0,2]\nOutput is [1]. Hmm. What's special here? Maybe count the number of 2s? Let's see. Each row has two 2s, except the middle row which has one. Wait, the total 2s would be 2+1+2 = 5? Not sure. Or maybe it's about symmetry. The grid looks symmetric. The first and third rows are the same, and the middle row is symmetrical. Maybe the output is 1 when the grid is symmetric in some way.\n\nExample 1:\nInput:\n[2,0,0]\n[2,0,0]\n[0,2,0]\nOutput [7]. This grid doesn't look symmetric. The first two rows are the same, but the third is different. Maybe the number of 2s here. Let's count. First row has one 2, second row one, third row one. Total 3. But in Example 0, total 5 2s. Maybe not.\n\nWait, maybe the output relates to the positions of the 2s. Let's visualize the grids as 3x3 matrices. Maybe the 2s form the shape of a number. For example, the number 1 might be a vertical line of 2s down the center. Let's check Example 0's grid. The middle element of each row is 2, except the middle row which has a 2 in the center. Wait, no, the middle row is [0,2,0], so center is 2. So the first row has 2s at positions 0 and 2, middle row center, third row again 0 and 2. Hmm, maybe not a vertical line. Alternatively, maybe the pattern of 2s forms the digit 1 or 7 when laid out as a 3x3 grid.\n\nLooking at how digits are displayed on a seven-segment display. For example, the number 1 is typically the right two vertical lines, or maybe the center vertical. The number 7 would be the top horizontal and the right vertical. Let's see.\n\nIn Example 0, the 2s are at positions (0,0), (0,2), (1,1), (2,0), (2,2). If I imagine this as a grid, maybe it's like a diamond shape. But how does that translate to 1?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the number of connected regions of 2s. Like in Example 0, the 2s are arranged in a cross? Wait, but there's 2s at the corners and center. Maybe it's more like four 2s in the corners and one in the center. But that's five 2s. Not sure.\n\nLooking at Example 1's grid:\nRow 0: 2 at first position.\nRow 1: 2 at first position.\nRow 2: 2 at second position.\nSo plotting these, it might form a 7 shape. The left vertical and the middle horizontal. Maybe that's how. So if the 2s form a 7 shape, output is 7, and if they form a 1 shape, output is 1.\n\nAnother example: Example 2's input is all rows [2,0,2]. So rows 0,1,2 all have 2s at first and third positions. If you imagine that, maybe it's like two vertical lines on the left and right, which could be the shape of a 0, but the output is 1. Hmm, that doesn't fit. Maybe another approach.\n\nWait, maybe the output is determined by the number of 'arms' in the 2s. For example, a 1 has one vertical line, while a 7 has two lines (horizontal and vertical). Let's check.\n\nIn Example 0, the 2s are arranged in a cross-like pattern? But maybe not. The positions are (0,0), (0,2), (1,1), (2,0), (2,2). That looks like an 'X' around the center. So maybe not a 1. Alternatively, maybe the center column has 2s. No, because the middle row is [0,2,0], so center column is 2 only in the middle row. So the center column is 0, 2, 0. Maybe that's a vertical line in the center, which would be a 1. Then Example 0's output is 1. That makes sense. Because a vertical line in the middle is the 1. \n\nThen Example 1's 2s are in positions (0,0), (1,0), (2,1). So that's left vertical (top two) and middle of the bottom. Maybe forming a 7. Like the top left and middle bottom, which could form a 7's shape. So output is 7.\n\nLet's check Example 3:\nInput is:\n[0,0,0]\n[2,0,2]\n[0,0,0]\nOutput is [1]. The middle row has 2s at the ends. But according to the previous idea, 1 is the center vertical. But here, middle row has 2s at first and third positions. So maybe that's not matching. Wait, maybe my initial assumption is wrong.\n\nWait, maybe the 1 is represented by the middle column. Let's see. For Example 3, the middle row has 2s in the first and third positions, which are not the middle column. So maybe that's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the number 1 is when there's a single line of 2s either vertically or horizontally. For example, in Example 3, the middle row has two 2s. That's a horizontal line. But output is 1. So maybe a horizontal line in the middle would be 1. But then why Example 0's output is 1? Example 0's middle row has a single 2 in the center. So maybe if the 2s form a vertical or horizontal line in the center, it's 1. Otherwise, 7.\n\nWait, Example 0's grid has 2s in the corners and the center. So maybe not a straight line. Hmm, this is getting confusing.\n\nLet me try a different approach. Let's list the positions of the 2s in each example and see if there's a pattern in their coordinates.\n\nExample 0:\nPositions with 2s: (0,0), (0,2), (1,1), (2,0), (2,2). Output 1.\n\nExample 1:\n(0,0), (1,0), (2,1). Output 7.\n\nExample 2:\nAll rows are [2,0,2], so positions (0,0), (0,2), (1,0), (1,2), (2,0), (2,2). Output 1.\n\nExample 3:\nMiddle row has (1,0) and (1,2). Output 1.\n\nExample 4:\nFirst row (0,0) and (0,1), second row (1,1) and (1,2). Output 7.\n\nExample 5:\nFirst row (0,0), (0,1), second row (1,1). Output 7.\n\nLooking at these, maybe the key is the number of connected components of 2s. But Example 0 has 5 2s connected in a cross shape (maybe one component), output 1. Example 1 has three 2s connected in an L-shape (one component), output 7. But how does that map to the numbers 1 and 7?\n\nAlternatively, think of each 3x3 grid as representing the segments of a seven-segment display, where each cell corresponds to a segment. But how?\n\nIn a seven-segment display, the segments are labeled a to g. Let's imagine mapping the 3x3 grid to these segments. For example:\n\n a \nf b\n g \ne c\n d \n\nBut maybe a more common mapping for a 3x3 grid is:\n\n a\nfgb\n edc\n h \n\nWait, perhaps the cells correspond to the segments. For instance, the top row middle cell is segment a, middle row left is f, middle row center is g, middle row right is b, bottom row left is e, bottom row center is d, bottom row right is c. Then the center cell (1,1) is g. So, if in the input grid, the 2s are in the positions that form the segments of a digit, then the output is that digit.\n\nFor example, the digit 1 requires segments b and c (right vertical). So in the grid, that would correspond to positions (0,2), (1,2), (2,2). But in Example 0, there are 2s at (0,2) and (2,2), but also others. Hmm, maybe this approach isn't matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s form the shape of the digit when the grid is viewed. For example, in Example 0, the 2s are arranged in a cross (corners and center), which might not correspond to any digit, but the output is 1. Wait, but maybe the center vertical line. If the middle column is all 2s, that would be a vertical line, which is the 1. Let's check.\n\nExample 0's middle column is [0,2,0], so only the middle cell is 2. That's a single point, not a line. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the number of continuous vertical or horizontal lines made by 2s. For instance, a single vertical line (like the middle column) would be 1. A combination of a horizontal and vertical line (like the top row and right column) would be 7.\n\nLet's test this:\n\nExample 0: The 2s are in the four corners and the center. So that's not a vertical or horizontal line. But output is 1. Hmm, maybe not.\n\nExample 1: The 2s are in positions (0,0), (1,0), (2,1). This forms a sort of L-shape. If the top and middle-left form a vertical line (positions (0,0) and (1,0)), and then (2,1) is a horizontal segment, maybe that forms a 7. The 7 has a horizontal top and a vertical right, but this is more like a vertical left and a horizontal middle. Maybe the orientation is different.\n\nAlternatively, if the 2s form the shape of the digit when the grid is considered as a 3x3 display. For example, the digit 1 in a 3x3 grid might be the middle column filled. So for Example 0, the middle column is [0,2,0], which is just the center. But maybe that's considered a 1. In Example 2, all rows have 2s in the first and third columns, which would form two vertical lines (like a 0), but the output is 1. So that doesn't fit.\n\nThis is tricky. Let me look for another pattern. The outputs are either 1 or 7. So perhaps the answer is based on the presence of certain patterns. Let's see:\n\nLooking at all examples where the output is 1:\n\nExample 0: Grid has 2s in corners and center.\n\nExample 2: All rows have 2s in first and third positions (like vertical lines on the sides).\n\nExample 3: Middle row has 2s in first and third positions, other rows are 0.\n\nWhere output is 7:\n\nExamples 1,4,5.\n\nLooking at 7 examples:\n\nExample1's 2s are in (0,0), (1,0), (2,1). Maybe this forms the top and vertical lines of a 7.\n\nExample4: [2,2,0] in first row, [0,2,2] in second, third row all 0. The 2s form a diagonal from top-left to middle-right and then to bottom-right? Maybe like a 7.\n\nExample5: [2,2,0], [0,2,0], [0,0,0]. The 2s form a vertical line on the left and a horizontal line in the middle. Maybe that's a 7.\n\nSo perhaps the pattern is that if the 2s form a shape resembling 1, output 1; if resembling 7, output 7.\n\nBut how to define that?\n\nAnother angle: the output is 1 when the grid is symmetric in certain ways. For instance, Example0's grid is symmetric along both the vertical and horizontal axes. Example2 is symmetric along vertical axis (each row is same left and right). Example3 is symmetric along horizontal axis (since the middle row is mirrored, but top and bottom rows are all 0). So maybe symmetry is a factor for output 1. Examples with output 7 are not symmetric.\n\nExample1's grid isn't symmetric. Example4's first row is [2,2,0], second [0,2,2], which is a kind of diagonal symmetry maybe, but output is 7. So perhaps symmetry leads to 1, and asymmetry to 7.\n\nBut Example5's input is [2,2,0], [0,2,0], [0,0,0]. The first row is not symmetric, so output is 7. But Example3's input is symmetric (middle row has 2s at ends, others 0s), output 1. So maybe when the 2s are arranged symmetrically, output is 1; otherwise, 7.\n\nLet's check the Test Input:\n\nTest Input:\n[2,0,2]\n[2,2,2]\n[2,0,2]\n\nLooking at symmetry. The first and third rows are the same. The middle row is all 2s. The grid is symmetric along both vertical and horizontal axes. So according to the symmetry pattern, the output should be 1. But let's see.\n\nWait, but in Example2, the input is three rows of [2,0,2], which is symmetric, output 1. The test input has first and third rows as [2,0,2], middle row [2,2,2]. So the entire grid is symmetric. So according to the symmetry hypothesis, the output should be 1. But let me cross-verify with the examples.\n\nAnother angle: Maybe the output is 1 if the number of 2s is odd, and 7 if even. Let's check:\n\nExample0: 5 (odd) \u2192 1.\n\nExample1: 3 (odd) \u21927. Doesn't fit.\n\nHmm, no. Example2 has 6 2s (even) \u2192 output 1. So that's not it.\n\nAnother thought: Maybe the number of connected regions of 2s. Example0's 2s form a cross (one connected region), output 1. Example1's 2s form a connected L-shape (one region), output7. So that doesn't differentiate.\n\nAlternatively, the output is 1 when there's a single continuous line (like vertical or horizontal) and 7 when there's a combination of lines (like top and right). But it's unclear.\n\nAlternatively, the number of corners with 2s. Example0 has all four corners as 2s. Output 1. Example3 has middle row's corners (but that's first and third positions in the middle row, which are edges, not corners of the grid). Not sure.\n\nWait, the test input has all corners as 2s (positions (0,0), (0,2), (2,0), (2,2)) and the middle row filled with 2s. So that's a cross with a horizontal line in the middle. Maybe this forms a shape of a 0, but the output examples for cross-shaped 2s (like Example0 and Example2) have output 1. But the middle row being all 2s might change things. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the presence of a full row or column. The test input's middle row is all 2s. Let's check the examples. Example2's all rows are [2,0,2], so no full row. Example3's middle row is [2,0,2], not full. Example0's middle row is [0,2,0]. So perhaps when there's a full row (all 2s), it's part of the pattern.\n\nBut in the test input, the middle row is all 2s. Let's see if that's present in any example. In Example2, all rows have two 2s. Example3's middle row has two. So the test input's middle row is the first example with a full row. How does that affect the output?\n\nIf the test input is symmetric and has a full middle row, perhaps it's still considered a 1. But according to the examples, symmetric grids with 2s in symmetric positions (like Example0, 2, 3) have output 1. The test input is symmetric, so output would be 1. But I need to make sure.\n\nAnother approach: Let's think about the examples where output is 7. Example1's 2s are in (0,0), (1,0), (2,1). This could be the vertical left line and a diagonal, forming a 7. Example4's 2s are first row [2,2,0], second row [0,2,2], which forms a diagonal pattern. Example5's 2s are first row left two, second row center. Maybe forming the top horizontal and left vertical (like a 7). \n\nSo when the 2s form a shape similar to a 7 (like a horizontal top and vertical right), output is 7. Otherwise, if it's symmetric or forms a vertical line, output is 1.\n\nThe test input has a cross shape with the middle row filled. That's a vertical line (corners and middle row filled), but it's more like a cross. But cross-shaped grids in Example0 and 2 have output 1. So the test input's cross with a filled middle row would also output 1. So the answer would be [1]."

        "cot_1": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. So, looking at the training examples, each input is a 3x3 grid of numbers (0s and 2s), and the output is a single number in brackets. The outputs are either [1] or [7]. I need to find out what transformation or rule turns the input grid into those numbers.\n\nFirst, let's list out the examples and see if there's a common theme.\n\nExample 0:\nInput:\n[2,0,2]\n[0,2,0]\n[2,0,2]\nOutput: [1]\n\nExample1:\nInput:\n[2,0,0]\n[2,0,0]\n[0,2,0]\nOutput: [7]\n\nExample2:\nAll rows are [2,0,2], output is [1].\n\nExample3:\nMiddle row is [2,0,2], others are all 0s. Output [1].\n\nExample4:\nFirst row [2,2,0], second [0,2,2], third all 0s. Output [7].\n\nExample5:\nFirst row [2,2,0], second [0,2,0], third all 0s. Output [7].\n\nHmm. The outputs are 1 or 7. Since 1 and 7 are numbers, maybe they're looking at the shape formed by the 2s and interpreting it as a digit on a 7-segment display. Let's think about that.\n\nA 7-segment display for digits has segments labeled a to g. The number 1 uses two vertical segments (right side), and 7 uses the top horizontal and the two right vertical segments.\n\nLooking at the grids. Let's imagine each cell in the 3x3 grid corresponds to part of a 7-segment display. For example:\n\nIf the grid is arranged as:\n\n a \nf b\n g \ne c\n d \n\nWait, maybe the standard 3x3 grid mapping to 7 segments. Let me recall. A common way to map a 3x3 grid to segments is:\n\nTop row (positions 0,1,2) might correspond to segment a (top horizontal), middle row's left and right could be segments f and b, the middle cell (1,1) could be segment g (middle horizontal), bottom row's left and right could be e and c, and the bottom horizontal as d. But maybe the arrangement is different.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 3x3 grid represents the segments as follows:\n\nSegments:\n\n a\nf b\n g\ne c\n d\n\nSo the positions in the grid could be:\n\nRow 0 (top row): cells 0 (a's left?), 1 (a), 2 (a's right?) but that might not fit. Alternatively, perhaps the 3x3 grid's cells represent the segments. For example:\n\n- The top-middle cell is segment a.\n- The middle-right cell is segment b.\n- The bottom-middle is segment d.\n- The middle-left is segment f.\n- The middle cell is segment g.\n- The top-right is segment c?\nWait, maybe not. This might need a better approach.\n\nAlternatively, think of the 7-segment display as arranged with the segments:\n\n a \nf   b\n g \ne   c\n d \n\nSo, each segment's position in the 3x3 grid could be:\n\n- a: top row, middle column (0,1)\n- b: top right (0,2)\n- c: bottom right (2,2)\n- d: bottom row, middle (2,1)\n- e: bottom left (2,0)\n- f: top left (0,0)\n- g: middle row, middle (1,1)\n\nWait, that might not fit a standard 3x3 grid. Let me think again.\n\nAnother way: Maybe the 3x3 grid cells are the segments. For example, each cell corresponds to a segment if it's a 2. So, the 3x3 grid might represent the segments as follows:\n\nPositions (row, column):\n\n(0,0) is segment a?\n\nWait, perhaps the arrangement is:\n\n a\n-----\nb | c\n-----\n d\n-----\ne | f\n-----\n g\n\nBut that's a 7-segment display. Alternatively, perhaps the 3x3 grid is a way to represent the segments. For example:\n\nIn a 3x3 grid:\n\n- The top horizontal (a) is the middle cell of the top row (0,1)\n- The upper right vertical (b) is (0,2)\n- The lower right vertical (c) is (2,2)\n- The bottom horizontal (d) is (2,1)\n- The lower left vertical (e) is (2,0)\n- The upper left vertical (f) is (0,0)\n- The middle horizontal (g) is (1,1)\n\nIf that's the case, then each 2 in the grid represents an active segment.\n\nNow, let's check the examples.\n\nExample0:\n\nInput:\nRow0: [2,0,2] \u2192 (0,0)=2 (f), (0,2)=2 (b)\nRow1: [0,2,0] \u2192 (1,1)=2 (g)\nRow2: [2,0,2] \u2192 (2,0)=2 (e), (2,2)=2 (c)\nSo active segments: f, b, g, e, c. Wait, but the number 1 in 7-segment is segments b and c. Wait, maybe this isn't matching. Let me think again.\n\nWait, number 1 in 7-segment display is segments b and c (right vertical). If in this arrangement, segments b and c are (0,2) and (2,2). So in Example0, (0,2) is active (b), and (2,2) is active (c). So that's the two segments for 1. But in Example0's input, there are also other 2s. For instance, (0,0)=2, (1,1)=2, (2,0)=2. So that would activate segments f, g, and e, which are not part of the 1. But according to Example0's output, the output is [1]. That's a contradiction. So perhaps my initial assumption is wrong.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the grid represents the 7 segments in a different way. Let's think differently. Maybe each row in the 3x3 grid represents a segment. For example, the top row corresponds to segment a, the middle row's left and right to segments f and b, the middle cell to g, the bottom row's left and right to e and c, and the bottom middle to d. But how would that fit?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the number of 2s in certain positions determines the digit. Let's count the number of 2s in each example.\n\nExample0: 2,0,2 \u2192 2; 0,2,0 \u21921; 2,0,2\u21922. Total 2+1+2=5 2s. Output is 1.\n\nExample1: 2,0,0 \u21921; 2,0,0\u21921; 0,2,0\u21921. Total 1+1+1=3 2s. Output 7.\n\nExample2: All rows have 2,0,2 \u2192 each has two 2s. Total 6. Output 1.\n\nExample3: Middle row has 2,0,2 \u2192 two 2s. Others are 0s. Total 2. Output 1.\n\nExample4: First row has two 2s (2,2,0), second row has two 2s (0,2,2). Total 4. Output 7.\n\nExample5: First row two 2s, second row one. Total 3. Output 7.\n\nSo the number of 2s doesn't directly determine the output. Because example0 has 5 2s and outputs 1, example1 has 3 and outputs7. Example2 has 6 \u21921. Example3 has 2 \u21921. Example4 has4\u21927. Example5 has3\u21927. So it's not a count.\n\nAlternative idea: Maybe the positions of the 2s form the shape of the digit. For example, if the 2s form the segments of the digit 1 or 7.\n\nLooking at the outputs:\n\nDigit 1 uses two vertical segments (right side), and 7 uses the top horizontal and the two right vertical.\n\nSo, let's see:\n\nIn example0, the 2s are at positions (0,0), (0,2), (1,1), (2,0), (2,2). If we imagine this grid as:\n\nRow0: 2 0 2 \u2192 left and right top.\n\nRow1:0 2 0 \u2192 middle.\n\nRow2:2 0 2 \u2192 left and right bottom.\n\nBut how does that form a 1? Maybe the right vertical (positions (0,2), (1,2) (but there's 0 there), and (2,2). Wait, in example0, row1 has (1,1) as 2, not (1,2). So maybe not. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that if the 2s form a vertical line on the right (columns 2 in all rows), that's a 1, and if there's a top horizontal plus right vertical, that's a 7.\n\nLooking at Example0:\n\nRight column (positions 0,2; 1,2; 2,2) are 2,0,2. So not a full vertical line. Middle row's right is 0. So maybe that's not it.\n\nWait, but in example3:\n\nInput is:\n\n[0,0,0]\n\n[2,0,2]\n\n[0,0,0]\n\nSo the 2s are in the middle row's left and right. Which maybe forms a horizontal line. But the output is [1]. That doesn't make sense for 1. Hmm.\n\nAlternative approach: Let's look at which examples output 1. Examples0,2,3 output 1, others 7.\n\nLooking at examples that output 1:\n\nExample0: The grid has 2s at (0,0), (0,2), (1,1), (2,0), (2,2). So it's a cross shape (center and corners).\n\nExample2: All rows are [2,0,2]. So left and right columns are 2s, middle is 0. So vertical lines on left and right. Output is 1.\n\nExample3: Only middle row has [2,0,2]. So vertical lines in the middle row's left and right. Output is 1.\n\nWait, maybe if the 2s are in the left and right columns of any row, that's part of the pattern for 1. But in example0, left and right columns have 2s in all rows except middle row's left is 0 and right is 0.\n\nHmm. Not sure.\n\nLooking at the examples that output 7:\n\nExample1: The 2s are in the first and second rows' first column (positions (0,0), (1,0)), and the middle row's middle (1,1) has 2? Wait, input for example1 is:\n\nRow0: [2,0,0]\n\nRow1: [2,0,0]\n\nRow2: [0,2,0]\n\nSo 2s are at (0,0), (1,0), (2,1). So the left column in first two rows and middle of last row. How does that form a 7?\n\nIn 7-segment, 7 is the top bar (a) and the two right verticals (b and c). So maybe if the 2s are in positions corresponding to a, b, c.\n\nIn example1's 2s: (0,0) (f?), (1,0) (maybe not), (2,1) (d). Not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the number of connected 2s. But example0 has 5 2s connected in a cross shape. Output 1.\n\nAnother idea: Maybe the grid represents a binary number, and the output is its decimal equivalent. But looking at the grids:\n\nTake example0, perhaps each row is a binary digit, but with 2s. Not sure. Alternatively, sum of all elements. Example0: 2+0+2 +0+2+0 +2+0+2 = 10. Output is 1. Not matching.\n\nAlternatively, count the number of 2s in the middle row. Example0's middle row has 2. Output 1. Example1's middle row has 0. Output7. Not directly.\n\nWait, example3 has middle row [2,0,2], output is 1. Example4's middle row [0,2,2], output7. So maybe if the middle row has two 2s, it's 7. But example5's middle row has [0,2,0], output7. Hmm.\n\nAlternative approach: Let's see if the output is determined by the positions of the 2s forming the digits 1 or 7 in the grid.\n\nLooking for 1:\n\nIn 7-segment, 1 is right vertical segments (b and c). So in the grid, the right column (positions (0,2), (1,2), (2,2)) would need to have 2s. But example0's right column has 2 in row0 and row2, but row1 is 0. So perhaps it's not that strict.\n\nAlternatively, maybe if the 2s form a vertical line (either left, middle, or right column), it's 1. But example0 has 2s in left and right columns. Example2 has 2s in left and right columns for all rows. So that could be two vertical lines, but output is 1. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, if there's a vertical line of 2s in any column, it's 1. But example3's middle row has left and right 2s, but other rows have 0s. So maybe two vertical lines, but not continuous. Still output1.\n\nHmm.\n\nLooking at examples that output7: example1,4,5.\n\nExample1's grid:\n\nRow0: 2,0,0\n\nRow1: 2,0,0\n\nRow2:0,2,0\n\nThe 2s form a left vertical line (rows 0 and 1), and a middle in row2. Maybe that's like the top bar (left vertical?), but not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s form the shape of a 7. For example, top horizontal and right vertical. But how would that look in the grid.\n\nSuppose top horizontal is row0, middle column (0,1), but in example1, row0's middle is 0. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the presence of 2s in certain positions triggers 7. For example, if there are 2s in the left column and the middle row's middle cell. But example1 has left column 2s in rows0 and1, and middle cell in row2 is 2. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's the number of corners that have 2s. For example, 1 has two corners (top-right and bottom-right). But example0 has all four corners (0,0;0,2;2,0;2,2) as 2s. Output1. Example1 has (0,0) as 2, (2,1) as 2. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is based on symmetry. For example, if the grid is symmetric, output1. If not, output7.\n\nExample0 is symmetric (mirror over vertical axis?), but maybe not. Let's see:\n\nRow0: 2,0,2 \u2192 symmetric around center.\n\nRow1: 0,2,0 \u2192 symmetric.\n\nRow2:2,0,2 \u2192 symmetric. So example0 is symmetric. Output1.\n\nExample1:\n\nRow0: 2,0,0 \u2192 not symmetric.\n\nRow1:2,0,0 \u2192 not symmetric.\n\nRow2:0,2,0 \u2192 symmetric. So overall not symmetric. Output7.\n\nExample2: All rows symmetric. Output1.\n\nExample3: Middle row symmetric. Others are all 0. Output1.\n\nExample4:\n\nRow0:2,2,0 \u2192 not symmetric.\n\nRow1:0,2,2 \u2192 not symmetric.\n\nRow2:0,0,0 \u2192 symmetric. So not symmetric. Output7.\n\nExample5:\n\nRow0:2,2,0 \u2192 not symmetric.\n\nRow1:0,2,0 \u2192 symmetric.\n\nRow2:0,0,0 \u2192 symmetric. So the first two rows are not symmetric. Output7.\n\nSo maybe symmetry is the key. If the entire grid is symmetric along the vertical axis (each row is symmetric), then output is 1. Otherwise, output is7.\n\nLet's check:\n\nExample0: All rows are symmetric \u2192 output1. Yes.\n\nExample1: Rows0 and1 are not symmetric \u2192 output7. Yes.\n\nExample2: All rows symmetric \u21921.\n\nExample3: Rows0 and2 are all 0 (symmetric), row1 is symmetric \u21921.\n\nExample4: Rows0 and1 are not symmetric \u21927.\n\nExample5: Row0 is [2,2,0], which is not symmetric (mirror would require first and third elements to be same, but 2 vs0 \u2192 not symmetric). So output7.\n\nYes, this seems to fit.\n\nSo the pattern is: if each row of the input grid is symmetric (i.e., the first and third elements of each row are the same), then output [1]. Otherwise, output [7].\n\nLet's test this with the test input:\n\nTest input:\n\n[0, 0, 0]\n\n[2, 0, 0]\n\n[2, 0, 0]\n\nCheck each row:\n\nRow0: [0,0,0] \u2192 first and third are 0 and0 \u2192 symmetric.\n\nRow1: [2,0,0] \u2192 first is2, third is0 \u2192 not symmetric.\n\nRow2: [2,0,0] \u2192 first is2, third is0 \u2192 not symmetric.\n\nSo since rows1 and2 are not symmetric, the overall grid is not symmetric. Therefore, output should be [7].",

        "cot_2": "Okay, let's see. I need to figure out the pattern here. So, the input is a 3x3 grid of numbers, and the output is a single number in a list. Let me look at the training examples to find the pattern.\n\nStarting with Example 0:\nInput:\n[2, 0, 2]\n[0, 2, 0]\n[2, 0, 2]\nOutput: [1]\nHmm. The grid has 2s and 0s. Let me count the 2s. First row has two 2s, second has one, third has two. Total 5? But output is 1. Maybe it's not about the count. What else?\n\nLooking at Example 1:\nInput:\n[2, 0, 0]\n[2, 0, 0]\n[0, 2, 0]\nOutput: [7]\nHmm. Here, maybe the positions of the 2s matter. Let's plot their positions. For Example 0, the 2s are in a diagonal pattern? Like (0,0), (1,1), (2,2), but maybe not exactly. Wait, the first row is 2,0,2. Then middle is 0,2,0. Then 2,0,2. So maybe it's a cross shape? Because the center is 2, and the corners are 2s. If that's the case, maybe the pattern is based on the shape formed by the 2s.\n\nIn Example 0, the output is 1. Example 1's output is 7. Let me check the 2s in Example 1. First row has 2 at (0,0). Second row has 2 at (1,0). Third row has 2 at (2,1). So maybe the arrangement of 2s forms a certain shape that corresponds to a number. Like maybe the numbers represent a seven-segment display? Because 1 and 7 are possible digits.\n\nSeven-segment displays: 1 uses two vertical segments on the right. 7 uses the top, upper right, and middle. So perhaps the grid is a representation of a seven-segment display where each position in the 3x3 grid corresponds to a segment. Let's map the grid positions to the segments.\n\nLet me imagine a 3x3 grid where each cell represents a part of the seven-segment display. The standard segments are:\n\n a \nf b\n g \ne c\n d \n\nWait, maybe a different mapping. Alternatively, the seven segments could be arranged as:\n\n a\nb c\n d\ne f\n g\n\nBut perhaps the 3x3 grid is arranged with the middle row being the horizontal segments. Let me think. For example, the top row (row 0) could be the top segment (a), the middle row (row 1) could have the upper right (b) and upper left (f) and middle (g) segments. Wait, maybe not. Alternatively, the standard seven-segment layout can be mapped to the 3x3 grid as follows:\n\nThe segments are a (top), b (upper right), c (lower right), d (bottom), e (lower left), f (upper left), and g (middle). So the 3x3 grid could correspond like:\n\na a a\nf   b\ng g g\ne   c\nd d d\n\nBut maybe each row and column in the 3x3 grid represents parts of the segments. For example, the center cell (1,1) might be part of the middle segment (g). Let's try to map each cell in the 3x3 grid to a segment.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each cell's presence (if it's a 2) lights up a specific segment. Let's consider the positions:\n\nRow 0 (top row): columns 0,1,2. Maybe row 0, column 0 is segment a (top left?), but I'm not sure. Let's look at example 0 again. The output is 1. The number 1 in seven-segment is segments b and c (the right verticals). So if in the grid, the 2s are in the positions corresponding to those segments.\n\nLooking at Example 0's input:\n\nRow 0: [2,0,2] \u2192 positions (0,0) and (0,2) are 2s.\nRow 1: [0,2,0] \u2192 position (1,1) is 2.\nRow 2: [2,0,2] \u2192 positions (2,0) and (2,2) are 2s.\n\nIf this grid corresponds to the number 1, which uses segments b and c. So where are b and c in the grid? Maybe the right vertical columns. So columns 2 in rows 0,1,2 would be segments b and c. Wait, but example 0 has 2s in (0,0), (0,2), (1,1), (2,0), (2,2). That seems like maybe a cross (the center and corners), but how does that relate to 1?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the number of connected 2s. In example 0, there are 5 2s forming a cross. But how does that become 1?\n\nWait, maybe it's not the seven-segment display. Maybe it's binary. Let's see: the outputs are 1 and 7. So binary 1 is 1, 7 is 111. But how does the grid convert to a binary number?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the positions of the 2s represent a binary number where each cell is a bit. But since the grid is 9 cells, but the outputs are small numbers, maybe it's the count of 2s modulo something. For example, example 0 has 5 2s, 5 mod 8 is 5, but the output is 1. So that's not matching.\n\nLooking at Example 1's input:\n\n[2,0,0]\n[2,0,0]\n[0,2,0]\n\nThe 2s are at (0,0), (1,0), (2,1). Count is 3. Output is 7. 3 mod 8 is 3, but output is 7. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternative approach: Maybe the pattern relates to symmetry. For example, in Example 0, the grid is symmetric across both diagonals and the center. Output is 1. Example 1 is not symmetric, output is 7. But how?\n\nAnother thought: The number of 2s in each row. Let's check:\n\nExample 0:\nRow 0: 2,0,2 \u2192 2\nRow 1: 0,2,0 \u2192 1\nRow 2: 2,0,2 \u2192 2\nSum: 2+1+2=5. Output 1.\n\nExample 1:\nRow 0: 2,0,0 \u21921\nRow 1: 2,0,0 \u21921\nRow 2:0,2,0 \u21921\nSum:3. Output 7.\n\nNo obvious relation. Maybe multiply the rows' counts. 2*1*2=4. Still not 1. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe the 2s form a certain pattern that represents a digit when viewed as a 3x3 grid. For example, the number 1 in a 3x3 grid might be the center column filled. Let's see:\n\nNumber 1 in a 3x3 grid could be:\n\n0,1,0\n\n0,1,0\n\n0,1,0\n\nBut in Example 0's input, the 2s are in positions (0,0), (0,2), (1,1), (2,0), (2,2). So that's like a X shape. But the output is 1. Hmm. Maybe that's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's the number of \"islands\" of 2s. An island is a group of connected 2s. Connected horizontally or vertically. Let's check:\n\nExample 0: The 2s form a cross. So all connected. One island. Output is 1.\n\nExample 1: Let's see. The 2s are at (0,0), (1,0), and (2,1). (0,0) is connected to (1,0). (2,1) is separate. So two islands. But output is 7. That doesn't fit. Hmm.\n\nWait, Example 4's output is 7. Let me check:\n\nExample4 input:\n\n[2,2,0]\n\n[0,2,2]\n\n[0,0,0]\n\nSo 2s are (0,0), (0,1), (1,1), (1,2). These form a single connected group (like a snake). So one island. Output is 7. So if example0 has 1 island and output 1, example4 has 1 island but output 7. So that can't be.\n\nAlternative approach: Maybe the pattern is based on the positions of the 2s in terms of binary encoding. Let's index the 3x3 grid positions as follows:\n\nRow 0: positions 0,1,2\n\nRow 1: positions 3,4,5\n\nRow 2: positions 6,7,8\n\nSo each cell is a bit. If a cell has a 2, it's considered as 1, else 0. Then the binary number formed by these bits is converted to decimal. Let's test this.\n\nExample0:\n\nPositions with 2: 0,2,4,6,8 \u2192 bits 0,2,4,6,8 are 1. So binary digits:\n\nbit0:1, bit1:0, bit2:1, bit3:0, bit4:1, bit5:0, bit6:1, bit7:0, bit8:1.\n\nBut binary numbers are usually read from right to left. Wait, but how would the bits be ordered? Let's arrange them as a 9-bit number. Let's take the grid as row-wise, left to right, top to bottom. So the bits would be:\n\nRow0: 0,1,2 \u2192 positions 0,1,2 (left to right)\n\nRow1: 3,4,5\n\nRow2:6,7,8\n\nSo for example0:\n\nRow0: [2,0,2] \u2192 2,0,2 \u2192 bits 1,0,1 (assuming 2 is 1, others 0)\n\nSo the binary number is 1 (pos0) 0 (pos1) 1 (pos2) 0 (pos3) 1 (pos4) 0 (pos5) 1 (pos6) 0 (pos7) 1 (pos8). So the bits are 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1. If we convert this binary number to decimal: 101010101 is 341 in decimal. But output is 1, which doesn't match. So this approach is wrong.\n\nAnother idea: Maybe sum the positions where 2s are present, then mod 10. For example0, positions are 0,2,4,6,8. Sum is 0+2+4+6+8=20. 20 mod 10 is 0. Not 1. Not helpful.\n\nWait, maybe the output is the count of 2s in the perimeter. Let's see:\n\nIn example0, perimeter cells are all except the center. The 2s are at (0,0), (0,2), (1,1), (2,0), (2,2). So perimeter 2s are (0,0), (0,2), (2,0), (2,2), and center (1,1) is also a 2. Perimeter is 4 cells. So count is 4. Output is 1. Doesn't match.\n\nAlternative approach: Looking for the output 1 and 7. Maybe the output is 1 when the 2s form a certain pattern, and 7 when another. Let's compare examples that output 1 and those that output 7.\n\nExamples with output 1: 0,2,3.\n\nExamples with output 7: 1,4,5.\n\nLooking at example0: the 2s form a cross (center and all four corners plus the edges?), but perhaps it's a diamond shape. Example3's input is:\n\n[0,0,0]\n\n[2,0,2]\n\n[0,0,0]\n\nSo two 2s in the middle row. Output is 1. Hmm. Maybe that's a horizontal line, which in seven-segment is the middle segment (g). But the number 1 in seven-segment doesn't use the middle segment. So this is confusing.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the number of lines formed by the 2s. For example, a cross (vertical and horizontal lines) would form a plus, which maybe is considered as two lines. But output 1. Not sure.\n\nWait, looking at example3 again. The input is:\n\nRow0: all 0s.\n\nRow1: 2,0,2.\n\nRow2: all 0s.\n\nSo two 2s in the middle row, first and third columns. So that's a horizontal line in the middle. Maybe that represents the middle segment (g), which is part of the number 0, 2, 3, 5, 6, 8, 9. But the output is 1, which doesn't use the middle segment. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is determined by the number of connected regions of 2s modulo something. For example, in example0, there's one connected region (the cross), so 1 mod 8 =1. But example1 has two connected regions (the left column and the middle in third row), so 2 mod 8=2, but output is7. Doesn't fit.\n\nAnother angle: Let's look for a binary encoding where each row or column contributes to the digit. For example, each row could represent a binary number, and the sum of those gives the output. For example, example0:\n\nRow0: [2,0,2] \u2192 maybe 101 in binary (if 2 is 1, 0 is 0), which is 5.\n\nRow1: [0,2,0] \u2192 010 \u2192 2.\n\nRow2: [2,0,2] \u2192 101 \u21925.\n\nSum 5+2+5=12. Not 1.\n\nAlternatively, multiply them: 5*2*5=50. Not 1.\n\nHmm. Not helpful.\n\nWait, what if the 2s represent the positions of a binary number where each cell is a bit (1 if 2, else 0), and then the bits are read in a certain order to form a binary number. But earlier that didn't work for example0.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the count of 2s in each row and column has some relation. For example, example0:\n\nRow0: 2, row1:1, row2:2. Columns: first column 2, second column 1, third column 2. So sum rows 5, columns 5. Output is 1. Not sure.\n\nExample1:\n\nRows: 1,1,1 \u2192 sum 3. Columns: first column 2, second 1, third 0. Sum columns 3. Output 7. 3+3=6, but 7 is not 6.\n\nAlternative idea: Maybe the output is based on the sum of the positions of the 2s, but using some encoding. For example, each cell's position (row, column) is converted to a value and summed. But example0's positions are (0,0), (0,2), (1,1), (2,0), (2,2). Summing row indices: 0+0+1+2+2=5. Column indices:0+2+1+0+2=5. Total 10. Output is 1. 10 mod 9 is 1. But example1's positions: (0,0), (1,0), (2,1). Row sum 0+1+2=3. Column sum 0+0+1=1. Total 4. 4 mod 9 is 4, output is 7. Doesn't match.\n\nHmm. This is tricky. Let's look for another approach.\n\nLooking at the outputs: 1 and 7. Both are primes, but not sure if that's relevant.\n\nWait, perhaps the number of 2s in each example:\n\nExample0: 5 \u2192 output1.\n\nExample1:3 \u2192 output7.\n\nExample2: all rows are [2,0,2], so each row has 2, sum 6 \u2192 output1.\n\nExample3: middle row has 2 and 2, so 2 \u2192 output1.\n\nExample4: first row has 2 and 2, second row 2 and 2, sum 4 \u2192 output7.\n\nExample5: first row 2,2 \u2192 sum2, second row 2 \u2192 sum1, total 3 \u2192 output7.\n\nSo the count of 2s doesn't directly correlate. For example, example0 has 5 2s \u2192 output1. Example3 has 2 \u2192 output1. Example1 has3 \u21927. Example4 has4 \u21927. Example5 has3 \u21927.\n\nSo maybe the parity. Examples with even counts of 2s: example0 (5 is odd), example3 (2 even) \u2192 output1. Examples with odd counts: example1 (3), example4 (4 even?), example5 (3). Wait, example4's sum is4, even. But output is7. So parity doesn't align.\n\nAnother angle: The output is 1 when the 2s form a symmetric pattern, and 7 otherwise. Let's check symmetry.\n\nExample0's grid is symmetric both vertically and horizontally. Output1.\n\nExample1's grid is not symmetric. Output7.\n\nExample2's grid has all rows [2,0,2], which is symmetric. Output1.\n\nExample3's grid has middle row [2,0,2], top and bottom all 0s. Symmetric. Output1.\n\nExample4's grid: first row [2,2,0], second [0,2,2], third [0,0,0]. If we flip horizontally, first row becomes [0,2,2], second becomes [2,2,0]. Not symmetric. So output7.\n\nExample5's grid: first row [2,2,0], second [0,2,0], third [0,0,0]. If we check vertical symmetry, first row [2,2,0] would need to mirror to [0,2,2]. So not symmetric. Output7.\n\nSo this seems to fit. The pattern is that if the grid is symmetric (either vertically or horizontally), then output is1. Otherwise, output7.\n\nLet's test this hypothesis against the examples.\n\nExample0: symmetric both ways \u21921.\n\nExample1: not symmetric \u21927.\n\nExample2: symmetric \u21921.\n\nExample3: symmetric \u21921.\n\nExample4: not symmetric \u21927.\n\nExample5: not symmetric \u21927.\n\nThis fits all training examples. So the rule is: if the grid is symmetric (vertically or horizontally), output [1], else output [7].\n\nNow, applying this to the test input:\n\nTest Input:\n[0, 0, 0]\n[2, 0, 0]\n[2, 0, 0]\n\nLet's check symmetry. First, check vertical symmetry (left-right mirror). Each row should be the same when reversed.\n\nRow0: [0,0,0] \u2192 reversed is same. Symmetric.\n\nRow1: [2,0,0] \u2192 reversed is [0,0,2]. Original is [2,0,0]. Not same. So row1 is not symmetric.\n\nRow2: [2,0,0] \u2192 reversed is [0,0,2]. Not same as original. So the entire grid is not symmetric vertically.\n\nCheck horizontal symmetry (top-bottom mirror). The grid should be the same when reversed row-wise.\n\nOriginal rows:\n\nRow0: [0,0,0]\n\nRow1: [2,0,0]\n\nRow2: [2,0,0]\n\nReversed rows (row0 becomes row2, row2 becomes row0). So reversed grid would be:\n\nRow0: [2,0,0]\n\nRow1: [2,0,0]\n\nRow2: [0,0,0]\n\nComparing with original, rows0 and row2 are different. So not horizontally symmetric.\n\nThus, the grid is not symmetric. So according to the pattern, the output should be [7]."
