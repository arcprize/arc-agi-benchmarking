        "cot_1": "Okay, let's see. I need to figure out the pattern here. So, the training examples have inputs that are multiple rows of arrays, and the outputs are transformed versions of those. Let's go through each example one by one.\n\nStarting with Example 0:\nInput is three rows of [1,1,1], [2,2,2], [1,1,1]. The output is [1], [2], [1]. Hmm, so each row in the output is just a single element. It looks like they're taking the first element of each row if all elements are the same. Because all elements in each input row are identical, so the output is just that element once. That makes sense.\n\nExample 1:\nAll three rows are [3,4,6]. The output is the same as the row. Wait, but in Example 0, when all elements are the same, they reduced it to a single element. But here, the output is the full array. Oh, maybe because the rows are the same across all rows. Wait, but Example 0's rows are different. Let's check the input for Example 1: all three rows are the same. So the output is the same as the row. Hmm, so maybe if all rows are identical, the output is the original row? But in Example 0, the rows are not all the same. Wait, the first and third rows in Example 0 are [1,1,1], and the middle is [2,2,2]. So the output for each row is a single element. But in Example 1, all rows are same, so output is the entire array.\n\nWait, maybe there's another pattern here. Let me check Example 2. Input has three identical rows [2,3,3,8,1], output is [2,3,8,1]. So they removed the duplicate 3 in each row. So maybe for each row, they're removing consecutive duplicates. Let's see: original row is 2,3,3,8,1. So the consecutive duplicates are the two 3s. So the output becomes 2,3,8,1. So that's removing consecutive duplicates. But wait, how does that fit with the other examples?\n\nExample 0's input rows are all the same elements, like [1,1,1]. If we remove consecutive duplicates, we get [1], which matches the output. Example 1's rows are [3,4,6]. Since there are no consecutive duplicates in each row, the output remains the same. But in the input of Example 1, all the rows are identical. So maybe when all rows are the same, the output is the row after removing consecutive duplicates. But the output in Example1 is the original array, which suggests that maybe there were no consecutive duplicates to remove. Wait, the input is [3,4,6] in each row. Each row has no consecutive duplicates, so output is the same. So the pattern is, for each row, remove consecutive duplicates. So regardless of other rows, each row is processed individually by collapsing consecutive duplicates into a single occurrence.\n\nBut then, looking at Example3: input has four rows. The first is [2,2], then [6,6], then two [8,8] rows. The output is [2], [6], [8]. So each row is processed by removing consecutive duplicates. For [2,2], it becomes [2]. For [6,6] becomes [6], etc. So yes, each row is processed individually.\n\nExample4: Input has multiple rows. The first two rows are [4,4,4,4], which would become [4]. The next two [2,2,2,2] become [2], then [8,8,8,8] becomes [8], and [3,3,3,3] becomes [3]. So the output rows are each the deduplicated version. \n\nSo the pattern seems to be: For each row in the input, collapse consecutive duplicate elements into a single occurrence, then output each processed row. So each row is processed independently by removing consecutive duplicates.\n\nNow, applying this to the Test Input. The test input is four identical rows: [1,1,2,3,3,3,8,8,4]. Let's process each row.\n\nLooking at one row: 1,1 (duplicates, so becomes 1), then 2 (no duplicate), 3,3,3 (becomes 3), 8,8 (becomes 8), 4. So the consecutive duplicates are 1s, 3s, 8s. After collapsing, the row becomes [1,2,3,8,4]. Since all four rows are the same, each processed row will be [1,2,3,8,4]. But wait, in the training examples, when all rows are identical, like Example1, the output is the processed row. So here, the output for each of the four rows would be [1,2,3,8,4]. But looking at the training examples, when all rows are same, the output is the deduplicated version once per row. For example, in Example1, all three input rows are the same, and the output has three rows of the same processed array. Similarly, the test input has four rows of the same array. So each of the four output rows would be the deduplicated array. So the answer should be four rows of [1,2,3,8,4].\n\nWait, but in Example0, the input has three rows, not all the same. The output has each row processed individually. So the processing is per-row, not considering other rows. So regardless of whether other rows are same or not, each row is processed by removing consecutive duplicates. Therefore, even if all four rows in the test input are the same, each row is processed individually. So each row would output [1,2,3,8,4], and since there are four rows in the input, the output would have four rows of that array.\n\nTherefore, the correct output for the test input would be four rows each [1,2,3,8,4]. Let's check the examples again to confirm. For example, in Example4, even though there are multiple rows, each is processed individually. So the output rows are each [4], [2], etc. So yes, each row in the output corresponds to the same row in the input after processing. So applying that logic here, the answer is four copies of [1,2,3,8,4].",

        "cot_2": "Okay, let's look at these training examples to figure out the pattern. The input is a list of lists, and the output is another list of lists. Let's start by examining each example.\n\nExample 0:\nInput has three identical rows [1,1,1], [2,2,2], [1,1,1]. The output is [1], [2], [1]. So each row in the output is a single element. It looks like maybe they took the first element of each row? Because all elements in each input row are the same.\n\nExample 1:\nAll three rows are [3,4,6], and the output is the same as the row. Wait, why didn't it get shortened here? Because maybe if all the rows are identical, the output is the same as the row. But in example 0, the rows are the same within each row but different across rows. Wait, no. Wait, in Example 1, all three input rows are identical. So maybe the output is that single row. Because in the output, it's [3,4,6], which is the same as the input row. But why isn't it condensed like in example 0?\n\nWait, example 0's input has three rows where each row is all the same number, but they are different across rows. The output takes the first element of each row. But in example 1, all rows are the same, so the output is the entire row. Hmm. That seems conflicting.\n\nWait, let's check example 2. Input is three identical rows [2,3,3,8,1]. The output is [2,3,8,1]. Wait, the original row has 2,3,3,8,1. The output removes the duplicate 3. So maybe when all rows are the same, they deduplicate consecutive duplicates? Like, in the input row, the two 3s are consecutive. So removing the duplicates, making it [2,3,8,1]. So example 2's output is each element once, but only consecutive duplicates are removed. Then in example 1, the input rows are [3,4,6], which have no consecutive duplicates, so the output remains the same. Oh, right! Because example 1's input rows have unique elements, so no duplicates to remove. So the output is the same as the input row.\n\nSo the pattern seems to be: For each row in the input, if all the rows are the same (i.e., all input rows are identical), then take the first occurrence of each element, removing consecutive duplicates (like run-length encoding but keeping each element once). Then, if the input has multiple rows where each row is the same, but the rows themselves are identical across, then the output is the deduplicated version. But if the rows are different, then the output for each row is just the first element.\n\nWait, looking back at example 0: The input has three rows. The first row is [1,1,1], second [2,2,2], third [1,1,1]. The output is [1], [2], [1]. So each output row is the first element of the input row. But why isn't it deduplicated like in other examples? Because maybe the rule is: If all the rows in the input are identical, then deduplicate consecutive duplicates. Otherwise, for each row, output the first element.\n\nWait, example 0's input has three rows, but they are not all identical. The first and third are [1,1,1], but the second is [2,2,2]. So the rows are not all the same. So in that case, each row's output is the first element. Because when the rows are not all the same, each row is converted to its first element.\n\nBut in example 1, all rows are the same, so output the deduplicated version (but in this case, there are no duplicates to remove, so it's the same as input).\n\nExample 3's input has four rows: [2,2], [6,6], [8,8], [8,8]. The output is [2], [6], [8]. The rows are not all identical. The first three rows are different, the last two are same. So because not all rows are identical, each row's output is first element.\n\nWait, example 3's output is [2], [6], [8]. The original input has four rows. But output has three rows. Wait, the input is four rows, but the output is three. Oh, wait no. Wait, input is four rows:\n\nRow1: [2,2]\n\nRow2: [6,6]\n\nRow3: [8,8]\n\nRow4: [8,8]\n\nOutput is:\n\n[2]\n\n[6]\n\n[8]\n\nSo the four input rows are transformed into three output rows. How? Because rows 3 and 4 are the same. Hmm. Wait, maybe the pattern is that if consecutive rows are identical, they are merged. But the output rows in example 3 are three, which corresponds to the first three rows of the input, but the fourth row is same as third, so maybe merged into one. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is per group of consecutive identical rows. So if multiple consecutive rows are identical, they are treated as a single group. For each group, if all rows in the input are part of the same group (i.e., all rows in the input are identical), then deduplicate their elements. Otherwise, for each group, take the first element of the row.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is:\n\n- If all the input rows are identical, then the output is the deduplicated version of any of those rows (removing consecutive duplicates).\n\n- If not all input rows are identical, then for each row in the input, output the first element of that row, but if there are consecutive duplicate rows, merge them into a single row in the output.\n\nBut looking at example 3:\n\nInput rows are [2,2], [6,6], [8,8], [8,8]. So the first three rows are distinct, but the fourth is same as third. So the output has three rows: [2], [6], [8]. So the consecutive duplicates (rows 3 and 4) are merged into one, and each row's first element is taken. So the output is the first element of each unique consecutive row group.\n\nSo the process could be:\n\n1. Group consecutive identical rows into a single group.\n\n2. For each group, if all input rows (across all groups) are the same, then output the deduplicated row (removing consecutive duplicates).\n\n3. Otherwise, for each group, output a list containing the first element of the row in the group.\n\nSo let's test this against the examples.\n\nExample 0:\n\nGroups are [1,1,1], [2,2,2], [1,1,1]. The groups are three, none consecutive. Since not all input rows are the same, each group is output as [1], [2], [1].\n\nExample 1:\n\nAll rows are same. So group is all rows. Deduplicate the row. Since the row is [3,4,6] with no consecutive duplicates, output is same as row.\n\nExample 2:\n\nAll rows are same. The input row is [2,3,3,8,1]. Deduplicate consecutive duplicates: becomes [2,3,8,1]. So output is that.\n\nExample 3:\n\nGroups are [2,2], [6,6], [8,8] (since last two rows are same). So three groups. Since not all rows are same, each group's first element is taken. So [2], [6], [8].\n\nExample4:\n\nInput rows:\n\n[4,4,4,4]\n\n[4,4,4,4]\n\n[2,2,2,2]\n\n[2,2,2,2]\n\n[8,8,8,8]\n\n[3,3,3,3]\n\nSo groups are 2 of [4], 2 of [2], 1 of [8], 1 of [3]. Since not all rows are same, each group's first element is taken. So output is [4], [2], [8], [3]. Which matches the example.\n\nSo the rule seems to be:\n\n- If all rows in the input are identical, then for that row, remove consecutive duplicates (so collapse runs of the same number into one).\n\n- Otherwise, group consecutive identical rows and output the first element of the row for each group.\n\nNow, applying this to the test input.\n\nTest Input:\n\nFour rows, all identical:\n\n[1,1,2,3,3,3,8,8,4]\n\nEach row is same.\n\nSo first check if all rows are identical. Yes. Then, the output is the deduplicated version of any of these rows.\n\nThe row is [1,1,2,3,3,3,8,8,4].\n\nDeduplicating consecutive duplicates:\n\n1 appears twice \u2192 becomes 1.\n\nThen 2.\n\nThen three 3s \u2192 3.\n\nThen two 8s \u2192 8.\n\nThen 4.\n\nSo deduplicated row is [1,2,3,8,4].\n\nBut wait, looking at the training examples:\n\nIn example 2, the input row was [2,3,3,8,1], which after deduplicating becomes [2,3,8,1]. So consecutive duplicates are removed, leaving one occurrence.\n\nSo for the test input row [1,1,2,3,3,3,8,8,4], the consecutive duplicates are:\n\n1,1 \u2192 1\n\nThen 2\n\n3,3,3 \u2192 3\n\n8,8 \u21928\n\nThen 4.\n\nSo the deduplicated version is [1,2,3,8,4]. But since all rows are identical, the output should be that list once. However, in the training examples, example 1's output is the same as the input row because there were no duplicates. Example 2's input row had consecutive duplicates which were removed.\n\nBut the test input has all four rows identical. So according to the rule, the output would be the deduplicated version of the row. So [1,2,3,8,4].\n\nWait, but in example 1, the output was the same as the input row because there were no duplicates. So the test input's row would be deduplicated to [1,2,3,8,4], and since all input rows are same, output is this deduplicated list once. But the output in the training examples when all rows are same is a single row. Wait, example 1's output is [3,4,6], which is one row. The test input has four rows, but they're all same, so output is one row: [1,2,3,8,4].\n\nBut wait, the test input is four rows, all same. So according to the pattern, the output should be the deduplicated version of any of those rows. So the answer is [1,2,3,8,4], but how is that presented? Let's check the examples again.\n\nIn example 1, input is three identical rows. Output is one row: [3,4,6].\n\nIn example 2, input three identical rows. Output is one row: [2,3,8,1].\n\nIn example 4, input has multiple groups. Output is multiple rows each with first element.\n\nSo for the test input, since all rows are same, the output should be a single row with the deduplicated elements.\n\nBut wait, the test input's rows are:\n\n[1,1,2,3,3,3,8,8,4]\n\nWhich deduplicated would be [1,2,3,8,4].\n\nSo the output should be [1,2,3,8,4].\n\nBut looking at the training examples, when all rows are same, the output is that deduplicated row. So the test case's output would be this single row.\n\nBut wait, looking back at the training examples:\n\nExample 1:\n\nInput has three identical rows, output is one row.\n\nExample 2: three rows, output is one row.\n\nSo the test case has four identical rows. So output is one row, the deduplicated version.\n\nBut the problem says to respond in the format of the training examples. Let's see the format.\n\nIn example 0, input has three rows, output has three rows. Because not all rows are same.\n\nIn example 3, input has four rows (two are same), output has three rows.\n\nIn example 4, input has six rows, output has four rows (groups of same rows are merged into one).\n\nSo the rule is: when consecutive rows are same, merge them into one group. For each group, output the first element of the row (if not all rows are same) or the deduplicated row (if all rows are same).\n\nWait, but the key is whether all input rows are identical. If yes, then deduplicate. Otherwise, group consecutive duplicates and take first element.\n\nSo in the test input, all four rows are same. So all rows are identical. So output is the deduplicated row.\n\nTherefore, the output is a single row: [1,2,3,8,4].\n\nBut looking at the training examples, when all rows are same, the output is the deduplicated row once. So yes.\n\nBut the test input's expected output should be this single row.\n\nBut the way the outputs are presented in the examples: For example 1, the output is [3,4,6]. So the answer should be that.\n\nSo the test input's output is [1,2,3,8,4].\n\nBut wait, looking back at the problem statement:\n\nThe user says to respond in the format of the training output examples.\n\nIn example 0, the output has the same number of rows as the input. But that's because each row was different. When rows are same and grouped, the output rows are fewer.\n\nBut in the test case, all four rows are same, so output is one row.\n\nSo the correct answer should be a single row: [1,2,3,8,4]."
