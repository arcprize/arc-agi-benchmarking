        "cot_1": "Okay, let's tackle this puzzle. The goal is to find the pattern that transforms the input lists into the output lists. Let's look at the training examples to see if I can spot a pattern.\n\nStarting with Example 0. The input is a 5x7 grid (5 rows, 7 elements each). The output is a 5x3 grid. So the output rows are shorter. Maybe each output row is derived from parts of the input row. Let's compare the input and output for each row.\n\nLooking at the first input row in Example 0:\nInput: [0,9,9,1,9,9,9]\nOutput: [0,0,0]\nHmm. The output has three elements. How does that relate? Let's check another row. The fourth row in input is [0,0,0,1,9,0,0] and the output is [0,8,8]. Wait, 8 appears here. Maybe it's looking for specific positions in the input row and transforming them based on some rule.\n\nWait, all the outputs are 5 rows of 3 elements. The input has 7 elements per row. Let's see if the output is taking certain positions from the input. Let's check positions. For example, maybe the first three elements of the input become the output, but no. Let's see:\n\nIn Example 0's fourth input row: [0,0,0,1,9,0,0] \u2192 Output [0,8,8]. So the input has 0s in the first three positions, but the output is 0,8,8. So maybe not directly taking those. Alternatively, maybe it's looking at the elements around the middle element. The input rows have a '1' in the fourth position (index 3). So perhaps the output is derived from elements around that 1?\n\nWait, each input row has a '1' in the fourth position. Let's check that. Yes, in all the examples, every input row has a 1 at index 3 (the fourth element). So the 1 is always in the middle. Maybe the output is related to the elements adjacent to the 1. Since the input rows are of length 7, the 1 is at position 3 (0-based index 3). The elements around it are positions 2 and 4. So maybe the output is formed by looking at elements to the left and right of the 1, and maybe something else.\n\nBut the output has three elements. Let's think: maybe the output for each row is the three elements before the 1, but modified. Wait, no, in Example 0's fourth row, input is [0,0,0,1,9,0,0]. The elements before 1 are [0,0,0], but the output is [0,8,8]. That doesn't match. Alternatively, the three elements after the 1? The elements after 1 in that row are 9,0,0. But output is 0,8,8. Hmm, not matching.\n\nAnother approach: Maybe the output is created by looking at certain columns. The input has 7 columns, output 3. So perhaps columns 2,3,4? Let's check. For example 0, first input row: [0,9,9,1,9,9,9]. Columns 2,3,4 are 9,1,9. Output is [0,0,0]. Doesn't match. So that's probably not.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is derived from the three elements surrounding the 1. So the element before the 1 (index 2), the 1 itself, and the element after (index 4). But the output in example 0's fourth row is [0,8,8]. The elements at indexes 2,3,4 are 0,1,9. So how does 0 become 0, 1 becomes 8, and 9 become 8? Not sure.\n\nWait, but the outputs sometimes have 8s. Let's see when 8 appears. For instance, in Example 0's fourth row output, two 8s. The input row around the 1 is 0,1,9. Maybe if the elements before and after the 1 sum to a certain value? 0 +9=9. 8 is 9-1? Not sure. Alternatively, maybe 8 represents some condition when elements around 1 are non-zero. Let's check other examples.\n\nLooking at Example 1's input. The first row is [0,0,0,1,9,0,0]. The output is [0,8,8]. The elements around 1 are 0 (index 2) and 9 (index4). The output has 8s here. Another example, Example 3's output has [8,0,8] in the fourth row. The input for that row is [0,9,0,1,0,0,0]. So around 1 is 0 (index2) and 0 (index4). But the output is 8,0,8. Hmm, that doesn't fit the previous idea.\n\nWait maybe the output is constructed by looking at the left and right elements of 1 and some other element. Let's think again. The output is three elements. So perhaps the three elements after the 1? Or before?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking the elements that are not 9 or 0. Wait, in Example 0's fourth input row, the elements after the 1 are 9,0,0. The output is [0,8,8]. So maybe the 9s and 0s are transformed into 8s. But how?\n\nAnother approach: Let's compare all input rows and their corresponding outputs. Let's look for a pattern where the output is determined by the elements in the input row that are adjacent to the 1. Let's list the input rows and their outputs:\n\nExample 0:\nRow 0 input: [0,9,9,1,9,9,9] \u2192 output [0,0,0]\nRow 1 input: [0,0,9,1,9,9,0] \u2192 [0,0,0]\nRow 2 input: [9,0,9,1,9,9,0] \u2192 [0,0,0]\nRow 3 input: [0,0,0,1,9,0,0] \u2192 [0,8,8]\nRow 4 input: [0,9,9,1,9,9,9] \u2192 [0,0,0]\n\nThe outputs for rows 0,1,2,4 are all zeros except row3. Let's check the elements around 1 in row3: left is 0 (index2), right is9 (index4). But output is [0,8,8]. Not sure.\n\nAnother thought: maybe the output is based on the positions of 0s and 9s in the input row, excluding the 1. For example, if there's a 9 in certain positions, it becomes an 8. Let's look at the output rows where 8s appear.\n\nIn Example0, row3's output is [0,8,8]. The input row has 0s before the 1 and 9,0,0 after. Maybe the number of 9s or 0s in certain positions. For example, the three elements after the 1: 9,0,0. How does that become 8,8? Maybe count the number of 9s and 0s, but not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the output might be a transformation of the left three elements (indices 0,1,2) and the right three elements (indices4,5,6). Let's see. For row3 input in example0, left three are 0,0,0, right three are9,0,0. Output is [0,8,8]. Maybe 0,0,0 (left) becomes 0, and 9,0,0 (right) becomes 8,8. How?\n\nWait, maybe the left and right parts are processed. For example, the left three elements and the right three elements (since the middle is 1). So each output row could be combining information from the left and right parts. The output has three elements, perhaps first element from left, then two from right? Or some other combination.\n\nLooking at Example0 row3 output: [0,8,8]. The left part is [0,0,0], right part is [9,0,0]. Maybe if the left part has all 0s, the first element is 0. The right part has a 9 followed by two 0s. How does that become 8,8? Maybe the number of 9s in the right three elements. In this case, one 9. But output has two 8s. Not sure.\n\nAlternative idea: Maybe the output is formed by taking the first three elements of the input row, then replacing 9 with 8. Let's check. For Example0 row0 input: first three elements are 0,9,9. Replacing 9s with 8s would give 0,8,8, but the output is [0,0,0]. So that's not it.\n\nWait, maybe the output is determined by the positions of 9s and 0s in the entire row. For instance, if there's a 9 in a certain position relative to the 1, it becomes an 8. Let's look for 8s in the output. For example, in Example1's first input row [0,0,0,1,9,0,0], the output is [0,8,8]. The elements after 1 are 9,0,0. So the first element after the 1 is 9, which could become 8, and the others are 0. But the output has two 8s. Hmm.\n\nAnother angle: The output is a 3-element list. Maybe each element corresponds to a count or a transformation of certain elements in the input row. For instance:\n\n- The first element of the output is the number of 0s in the first three positions.\n- The second element is 8 if there's a 9 adjacent to the 1 (left or right).\n- The third element is something else.\n\nBut let's test this. Take Example0 row3 input: [0,0,0,1,9,0,0]. The first three elements are 0,0,0 \u2192 3 zeros. Output first element is 0. So that doesn't match. Or maybe not the count.\n\nWait, perhaps the 8s are indicating where there are transitions from 9 to 0 or vice versa in the input. Alternatively, maybe the 8s are placed where there are 9s in the input, but in a specific way.\n\nLooking at Example0 row3 output [0,8,8]. The input row's right side (indices4,5,6) are 9,0,0. Maybe in the output, each 9 in the right three positions is converted to 8, but the 0s stay as 0. So 9 becomes 8, 0 remains. But in this case, 9 is at index4. So maybe the output's second and third elements are derived from the right three elements. So the right three are 9,0,0 \u2192 8,0,0. But the output is [0,8,8]. That doesn't fit. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is constructed by looking at the left of the 1 (indices 0-2) and the right of the 1 (indices4-6). For each side, if all are 0s, then 0. If there's a 9, then 8. Or some other rule.\n\nTake Example0 row3 again. Left side (indices0-2) are all 0s \u2192 maybe 0. Right side (indices4-6) are 9,0,0. If there's a 9, then convert to 8. But how to get two 8s here. Maybe count the number of 9s? There's one 9. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is a combination of the left three and right three elements, but with 9s turned into 8s. Let's test:\n\nExample0 row3 input: left three [0,0,0] \u2192 0,0,0. Right three [9,0,0] \u2192 8,0,0. But output is [0,8,8]. Doesn't fit. Hmm.\n\nWait, looking at Example2's output. Let's take the third input row: [0,9,9,1,0,9,9] \u2192 output [8,0,0]. The left three are [0,9,9], right three [0,9,9]. The output is 8,0,0. Maybe the first element of the output is 8 if there's a 9 in the left three. But there are two 9s here, but output is 8. The right three have two 9s, but output is 0,0. Not sure.\n\nAnother idea: The output for each row is determined by the presence of 9s in specific positions relative to the 1. For example, if the position immediately left of 1 (index2) is 9, then output something. Or the positions adjacent to 1 (left and right) determine certain parts of the output.\n\nIn Example1's first input row: [0,0,0,1,9,0,0]. The elements immediately left and right of 1 are 0 and 9. The output is [0,8,8]. Maybe if the right side (index4) is 9, that's converted to an 8, and the next positions (indices5 and 6) are 0s, converted to 8s. But that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by checking if the elements adjacent to the 1 (left and right) are 9. If left is 9, then first element of output is 8. If right is 9, then the third element is 8. But in Example0 row3, left is 0 and right is9. Output is [0,8,8]. So if left is 0, first element 0. Right is9, third element 8. But why the middle element is 8? Hmm.\n\nWait, looking at Example0's row3 output [0,8,8]. The input has 0s before 1 and 9,0,0 after. The output has two 8s. Maybe the middle element of the output is 8 if there's a 9 in any of the positions after the 1. But in this case, the first position after is 9. So perhaps the second and third elements of the output are 8 if there's a 9 in positions 4 and 5?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output's three elements correspond to the three elements after the 1 (positions4,5,6), with 9s replaced by 8s and 0s remaining. Let's test this.\n\nIn Example0 row3: positions4-6 are9,0,0 \u2192 output would be8,0,0. But the output is [0,8,8]. Doesn't match. So maybe not.\n\nLooking at Example1's output row0: input positions4-6 are9,0,0 \u2192 output is [0,8,8]. If we replace 9 with8, 0 with0, then it would be [8,0,0], but the output is [0,8,8]. Hmm.\n\nAlternative approach: Maybe the output is derived from the entire row, ignoring the 1. For example, counting the number of 9s in the row and then encoding it in some way. Let's check. Example0 row3 input has two 9s. Output has two 8s. But other rows have more 9s. For example, row0 in example0 has five 9s. Output has zero 8s. So that doesn't align.\n\nAnother idea: The output could be a transformed version of the three elements before the 1 (indices0-2) and the three elements after (indices4-6). For example, if any of those positions have a 9, it's turned into an 8. Let's see:\n\nTake Example0 row3 input: indices0-2 are0,0,0 \u2192 0s. indices4-6 are9,0,0. Replacing 9 with8 gives8,0,0. But the output is [0,8,8]. So that doesn't fit. Unless the positions are being reversed. 9,0,0 reversed is0,0,8. But output is0,8,8. Not matching.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is formed by checking whether the left and right parts of the 1 have any 9s, and then placing 8s accordingly. For example, if the left three elements (before 1) have at least one 9, then the first output element is8. If the right three elements have at least one 9, then the third element is8. But in Example0 row3, the right three have one 9. Output has two 8s. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe the output is a combination of the first and last elements of the left and right parts. For example, left part's first element and right part's first and last elements. Let's see:\n\nExample0 row3: left part starts with0, ends with0. Right part starts with9, ends with0. Output is0,8,8. If 9 becomes8, then maybe right start (9\u21928) and right end (0\u21920) but output is 8,8. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is determined by the presence of 9s in specific positions relative to the 1. For instance:\n\n- The first element of the output is 8 if there's a 9 two positions to the left of the 1 (index1).\n- The second element is 8 if there's a 9 immediately to the left of the 1 (index2).\n- The third element is 8 if there's a 9 immediately to the right of the 1 (index4).\n\nLet's test this.\n\nExample0 row3 input: index1 is0, index2 is0, index4 is9. So output would be [0 (no 9 at index1), 0 (no 9 at index2), 8 (9 at index4)]. But the output is [0,8,8]. Doesn't fit.\n\nAnother example: Example1's first row input. index1 is0, index2 is0, index4 is9. Output is [0,8,8]. Hmm, according to this idea, the third element would be8, but the output's second and third are8. So maybe it's index3+1 and index3-1. Wait, the 1 is at index3. So adjacent left is index2, right is index4.\n\nIf the output's middle element is 8 if either left or right of 1 is9. Let's check:\n\nExample0 row3: left is0, right is9. So output middle element is8. But output is [0,8,8], so the third element is also8. So perhaps both left and right being 9 or not.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output's three elements are:\n\n- Left of 1 (index2) \u2192 8 if 9, else 0.\n- The 1 is ignored.\n- Right of 1 (index4) \u2192 8 if 9, else 0.\n\nBut then the output would be two elements, but it's three. So maybe:\n\n- Left adjacent (index2) \u2192 first output element.\n- Right adjacent (index4) \u2192 third output element.\n- And the middle output element is something else, like if both left and right are 9, then 8.\n\nBut in Example0 row3: left is0, right is9 \u2192 output [0,8,8]. So first element 0, third element8. But the middle element is8. Why?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by the elements at indices1, 2, and5 of the input. Let's check Example0 row3 input: indices1 is0, 2 is0, 5 is0. Output is0,8,8. No. Doesn't fit.\n\nAnother angle: The output rows have three elements. Maybe each element corresponds to a specific trio of elements in the input row. For example, the first element of the output could be based on the first three elements of the input row, the second element on the middle three, and the third on the last three. But the input row has seven elements, so splitting into three parts isn't straightforward.\n\nAlternatively, the output's three elements could be derived from the three pairs of elements around the 1. For example, the pairs before the 1 (elements 0-2), the 1 itself (element3), and after (elements4-6). But how to condense that into three elements.\n\nWait, maybe the output is counting the number of 9s in the left three and right three elements of the 1, but converting that count to 8 if there's any 9. For example:\n\n- Left three elements: if any 9, first output element is8, else0.\n- Right three elements: if any 9, third output element is8, else0.\n- The middle output element is8 if the element directly right of 1 (index4) is9.\n\nBut let's test this.\n\nExample0 row3: left three are0s \u2192 first element0. Right three include9 \u2192 third element8. Middle element would be8 if index4 is9 \u2192 which it is. So output would be [0,8,8]. Which matches.\n\nAnother test: Example1 row0. Input row is [0,0,0,1,9,0,0]. Left three are0s \u2192 first element0. Right three are9,0,0 \u2192 any 9 \u2192 third element8. Middle element is9 \u21928. So output [0,8,8]. Which matches.\n\nAnother test: Example2 row0 input [9,0,0,1,9,0,9]. Left three are9,0,0 \u2192 has a9 \u2192 first element8. Right three are9,0,9 \u2192 has 9s \u2192 third element8. Middle element (index4) is9 \u21928. Output is [0,8,0]. Wait, but according to this idea, output would be [8,8,8]. But actual output is [0,8,0]. Hmm, this doesn't fit.\n\nWait, maybe my hypothesis is incorrect. Let's look at Example2's first input row:\n\nInput: [9,0,0,1,9,0,9] \u2192 output [0,8,0].\n\nAccording to previous idea:\n\nLeft three:9,0,0 \u2192 has9 \u2192 first element8. But output's first element is0. So this contradicts.\n\nSo maybe the hypothesis is wrong.\n\nAlternative approach: Let's look for another pattern. The 8s in the output might be indicating where there are 9s in certain positions, but maybe relative to the entire grid, not just the row.\n\nLooking at Example3's input row4: [9,0,0,1,9,0,0] \u2192 output [0,8,8]. The right three elements are9,0,0. So in this case, the first element of the output is0, but there's a9 in position4. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe the output is formed by looking at the three elements to the left of the 1 (indices0-2), and the three to the right (indices4-6). For each of these groups, if all elements are 9, then replace with 8. Otherwise, keep as 0. No, because in Example0 row3's right group has one 9 and two 0s, but output is8,8. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAnother idea: The output's elements are 8s where the corresponding input row has a 9 in the same position, but only for certain columns. For example, output columns might correspond to columns 2, 4, and 5 of the input. Let's check Example0 row3 input: columns2 is0,4 is9,5 is0. Output is0,8,8. So columns 2,4,5 would be0,9,0 \u2192 output 0,8,0. But actual output is0,8,8. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is derived from the sum of certain elements. For example, if the sum of elements in the left three is non-zero, the first element is8. But Example0 row3's left sum is0 \u2192 first element0. Right sum is9 \u2192 third element8. But output is0,8,8. Middle element's sum is9 (from index4?), so maybe middle is8. So if index4 is9 \u2192 middle output element8. Index4 is9 in Example0 row3. So output middle element8. Then, what about third element? If index5 and 6 sum to0 \u2192 maybe third element0, but in this case output third element is8. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed as follows:\n\n- The first element is 8 if there's a 9 in the first three positions of the input row, else 0.\n- The second element is 8 if there's a 9 immediately to the left of the 1 (index2) or immediately to the right (index4), else 0.\n- The third element is 8 if there's a 9 in the last three positions of the input row (indices4-6), else 0.\n\nLet's test this.\n\nExample0 row3:\n\nInput indices0-2:0,0,0 \u2192 no9 \u2192 first element0.\nIndices2 and4:0 and9 \u2192 either/or \u2192 second element8.\nIndices4-6:9,0,0 \u2192 contains9 \u2192 third element8.\nSo output [0,8,8], which matches.\n\nExample1 row0:\n\nInput0-2:0,0,0 \u2192 first element0.\nIndices2 and4:0 and9 \u2192 second element8.\nIndices4-6:9,0,0 \u2192 contains9 \u2192 third element8. Output [0,8,8] matches.\n\nExample2 row0 input:\n\nInput0-2:9,0,0 \u2192 has9 \u2192 first element8.\nIndices2 and4:0 and9 \u2192 second element8.\nIndices4-6:9,0,9 \u2192 has9 \u2192 third element8. But the output is [0,8,0]. So this contradicts.\n\nHmm. So why does Example2 row0 output [0,8,0]?\n\nInput row0: [9,0,0,1,9,0,9].\n\nAccording to the hypothesis:\n\nFirst element:8 (because 0-2 has9).\nSecond element:8 (since index4 is9).\nThird element:8 (since indices4-6 have9s).\nBut the output is [0,8,0]. So this hypothesis is incorrect.\n\nSo what's different here?\n\nLooking at Example2 row0 output: [0,8,0].\n\nSo the first and third elements are0, but according to the hypothesis, they should be8. So there's something else going on.\n\nAlternative idea: Maybe the output's elements are 8s only if the corresponding positions in the input are 9s and they are \"exposed\" or on the edge. For example, if there's a 9 in the first position of the input row, then first output element is8, etc. Let's check:\n\nExample2 row0 input: first element is9 \u2192 output first element is0. That doesn't fit.\n\nWait, maybe it's checking for 9s in the input but only if certain conditions are met. Like, if a 9 is adjacent to a 0. Let's see. For example, in Example0 row3's input, the 9 is at index4, which is adjacent to 0s at indices5 and6. So maybe that's why it becomes8. In Example2 row0 input, the 9s are at indices0,4,6. Are any of them adjacent to 0s?\n\n- Index0: next to 0 (index1).\n- Index4: next to9 (index3 is1, index5 is0).\nSo index4's 9 is adjacent to 0 (index5).\nSo maybe the 9s adjacent to 0s are converted to8s.\n\nBut how does that translate to the output?\n\nIn Example0 row3's input, the 9 at index4 is adjacent to 0 at index5. So this 9 becomes8 in the output. But how to determine which positions in the output correspond to which in the input.\n\nAlternatively, the output's three elements represent counts of 9s that are adjacent to 0s in certain regions of the input row. For example:\n\n- First element: number of 9s adjacent to 0s in the left three elements.\n- Second element: number of 9s adjacent to 0s around the 1.\n- Third element: number of 9s adjacent to 0s in the right three elements.\n\nBut this is getting complicated. Let's test.\n\nExample0 row3 input: left three are0,0,0. So no 9s. Right three are9,0,0. The 9 is at index4, adjacent to 0 at index5. So third element would be1 \u2192 converted to8? But output's third element is8. Maybe if count >=1, then8. So third element8. Middle element: the 9 at index4 is adjacent to 0 at index5 \u2192 so count1 \u21928. So output would be [0,8,8], which matches.\n\nExample2 row0 input: left three are9,0,0. The 9 at index0 is adjacent to 0 at index1 \u2192 count1. So first element8. The 9 at index4 is adjacent to 0 at index5 \u2192 count1. Middle element8. The right three are9,0,9. The 9 at index6 is adjacent to0 at index5 \u2192 count1. So third element8. But output is [0,8,0]. This contradicts.\n\nHmm. So this approach doesn't work.\n\nAnother idea: Maybe the output is the count of 9s in the left three elements (converted to8 if there are any), then similarly for the middle three and right three. Wait, but the output has three elements. Perhaps each element represents the presence of 9s in the left, middle, and right parts.\n\nFor example:\n\n- Left part: indices0-2 \u2192 9s present \u2192 first output element8.\n- Middle part: indices3 (the 1) is ignored, so maybe indices2-4?\n- Right part: indices4-6 \u21929s present \u2192 third output element8.\n\nBut Example0 row3's left part has no 9s \u21920. Middle part (indices2-4:0,1,9) \u2192 has9 \u2192 second element8. Right part has9 \u2192 third element8. So output [0,8,8], which matches.\n\nExample1 row0 input: left part no9 \u21920. Middle part (indices2-4:0,1,9) \u21929 \u2192 second element8. Right part has9 \u2192 third element8. Output [0,8,8]. Correct.\n\nExample2 row0 input:\n\nLeft part (indices0-2:9,0,0) \u2192 has9 \u2192 first element8.\nMiddle part (indices2-4:0,1,9) \u2192 has9 \u2192 second element8.\nRight part (indices4-6:9,0,9) \u2192 has9 \u2192 third element8. But output is [0,8,0]. So contradiction.\n\nHmm, this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternative idea: Maybe the output is based on the presence of 9s in specific positions relative to the 1, but only if there's a 0 adjacent to them. For example, a 9 that is next to a 0 in the input becomes an 8 in the output. But how to map this to the output's three elements.\n\nAlternatively, the output represents the 9s that are not surrounded by other 9s. For instance, a 9 that is isolated next to a0 becomes8.\n\nBut I'm not sure how to apply this to the output structure.\n\nLet's try looking at the test input to see if any patterns emerge. The test input is:\n\n[9,9,0,1,0,9,0]\n[0,9,9,1,0,0,0]\n[9,9,0,1,0,9,0]\n[9,9,9,1,9,0,9]\n[0,9,9,1,0,9,9]\n\nEach row has a 1 at index3. Let's apply the pattern from the previous hypothesis where the output is:\n\n- First element: 8 if left part (indices0-2) has any 9s.\n- Second element:8 if middle part (indices2-4) has any 9s.\n- Third element:8 if right part (indices4-6) has any 9s.\n\nTest row0: left part [9,9,0] \u2192 has9 \u2192 first element8. Middle part [0,1,0] \u2192 no9 \u2192 second0. Right part [0,9,0] \u2192 has9 \u2192 third8. Output would be [8,0,8]. But looking at the training examples, sometimes the output has 8s even when there are 9s in the middle part. For example, Example2 row0's input has a9 in middle part (indices2-4:0,1,9), so second element would be8. But in that example, the output is [0,8,0], not [8,8,8]. So this contradicts.\n\nAlternative approach: Let's look for other patterns. Maybe the output is derived by looking at the input row and replacing each 9 with an 8 in certain columns. For example, columns 1 and 2 and 5.\n\nBut looking at Example0 row3 input: [0,0,0,1,9,0,0]. Columns 1,2 are0,0. Column5 is0. Output is0,8,8. Not matching.\n\nAnother observation: The output is always 5 rows, each with three elements. The input is also 5 rows. So each input row maps directly to an output row. So the transformation is per-row.\n\nLooking at the examples, sometimes the output row has all zeros. For instance, in Example0's first three rows. Let's check their inputs:\n\nExample0 row0 input: [0,9,9,1,9,9,9]. The elements around the 1 (left is9, right is9). Output is [0,0,0]. So when both sides have9s, output is zeros? No, because in Example0 row3 input has a9 on the right, but output is [0,8,8].\n\nAnother possibility: The output is determined by the positions of the 9s relative to the 0s. For example, if there's a 9 followed by a0 in the input, it becomes an8 in the output. But how to map that to three elements.\n\nAlternatively, the output might be formed by checking for specific patterns in the input row. For example, if there's a 0 followed by a9, or vice versa, then replace with8.\n\nThis is getting too vague. Let's try to find a different approach. Let's look at all the examples and see if there's a common transformation.\n\nAnother observation: The outputs have 8s only in certain rows, and those rows in the input have 9s in specific positions. For example:\n\n- In Example0's row3 output [0,8,8], the input has 9 in position4, and 0s elsewhere in the right three elements.\n- In Example1's row0 output [0,8,8], the input has 9 in position4, 0s in5 and6.\n- In Example2's row0 output [0,8,0], the input has9 in positions0,4,6. But output is 0,8,0.\n- In Example3's row3 output [8,0,8], the input has 9 in positions1 and6.\n\nIt's not clear. Maybe the output is generated by looking at the number of 9s in certain segments. For example, if there's exactly one 9 in the left three and right three, then output 8s in certain positions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output represents some kind of code where 8s indicate the presence of certain conditions, like a 9 followed by a0.\n\nWait, let's look at Example0 row3's input right side:9,0,0. The 9 is followed by0. Maybe this sequence (9,0) converts to8. So wherever there's a 9 followed by a0 in the input, it becomes8 in the output. But how to map that to three elements.\n\nAnother Idea: The output is generated by looking at pairs of elements in the input. For example, for each of the three pairs in the input (excluding the 1), if the pair has a 9 and a0, replace with8.\n\nBut the input has seven elements, so three pairs would be (0,9), (9,1), (9,9) for example. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the output's three elements could be the result of checking the first three elements, the middle three elements (including the 1), and the last three elements. But this is unclear.\n\nWait, let's think of the output as three columns. Maybe each output column corresponds to a specific rule based on the input columns. For example:\n\n- The first output column is 8 if there's a 9 in column1 of the input.\n- The second output column is8 if there's a9 in column2 or column4.\n- The third output column is8 if there's a9 in column5.\n\nBut this is just a guess. Let's check Example0 row3:\n\nInput columns are [0,0,0,1,9,0,0]. So column1 is0, column2 is0, column4 is9. According to this idea:\n\n- First output element:0.\n- Second:8 (column4 has9).\n- Third:0 (column5 is0). But output is [0,8,8]. So third element is8, which would require column5 to have9. But it's0. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAnother approach: Let's look for a pattern where the output is determined by the number of 9s in specific positions of the input row.\n\nFor example:\n\n- The first element of the output is8 if there's exactly one9 in positions0-2.\n- The second element is8 if there's exactly one9 in positions2-4.\n- The third element is8 if there's exactly one9 in positions4-6.\n\nBut testing this:\n\nExample0 row3: positions0-2 (0,0,0) \u2192 no9 \u2192 first element0. positions2-4 (0,1,9) \u2192 one9 \u2192 second element8. positions4-6 (9,0,0) \u2192 one9 \u2192 third element8. Output [0,8,8], which matches.\n\nExample1 row0: positions0-2 (0,0,0) \u21920. positions2-4 (0,1,9) \u21921 \u21928. positions4-6 (9,0,0) \u21921 \u21928. Output [0,8,8]. Correct.\n\nExample2 row0 input: positions0-2 (9,0,0) \u21921 \u21928. positions2-4 (0,1,9) \u21921 \u21928. positions4-6 (9,0,9) \u21922 \u21920. So output would be [8,8,0]. But the actual output is [0,8,0]. So this doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. So the hypothesis works for some examples but not others. \n\nAlternative idea: Maybe the output is determined by whether there's a 9 in positions 1, 4, and 5. For example:\n\n- First output element is8 if position1 has a9.\n- Second output element is8 if position4 has a9.\n- Third output element is8 if position5 has a9.\n\nLet's test:\n\nExample0 row3: position1 is0 \u21920. position4 is9 \u21928. position5 is0 \u21920. Output [0,8,0]. But actual output is [0,8,8]. Doesn't fit.\n\nExample1 row0: position4 is9 \u21928. position5 is0 \u21920. Output would be [0,8,0], but actual output is [0,8,8]. Doesn't fit.\n\nExample2 row0 input: position1 is0, position4 is9, position5 is0. Output would be [0,8,0], which matches the actual output [0,8,0]. So this works for this case.\n\nBut for Example0 row3, it's not correct. Hmm.\n\nMaybe the third element is determined by position6. Let's check:\n\nExample0 row3: position6 is0 \u2192 third element0. But output is8. So no.\n\nAnother Idea: Let's look at Example2's output again. The output rows often have 8s in positions that seem to correlate with the presence of 9s in the input row's fourth and fifth positions. For example:\n\nExample2's first input row: [9,0,0,1,9,0,9]. The output is [0,8,0]. The fourth position is9, fifth is0. So maybe the second output element is8 if there's a9 in position4. But in Example0 row3, position4 is9 \u2192 second output element is8. But in this case, position4 is9 and second element is8. Wait, the output for Example2 row0 is [0,8,0]. So the second element is8, which aligns with position4 being9. The third element is0, which would correlate with position5 being0. So maybe:\n\n- First output element:8 if position0 has9.\n- Second output element:8 if position4 has9.\n- Third output element:8 if position5 has9.\n\nBut let's test:\n\nExample0 row3: position0 is0 \u21920. position4 is9 \u21928. position5 is0 \u21920. Output [0,8,0], but actual output is [0,8,8]. Doesn't fit.\n\nExample1 row0: position0 is0,4 is9,5 is0 \u2192 output [0,8,0], but actual is [0,8,8].\n\nSo this doesn't work. \n\nAlternative approach: Maybe the output elements are determined by the presence of 9s in specific pairs of positions. For example:\n\n- First output element:8 if positions0 and1 both have9s.\n- Second output element:8 if positions2 or4 have9s.\n- Third output element:8 if positions5 and6 have9s.\n\nBut this is just a guess. Let's test:\n\nExample0 row3: positions0 and1 are0 and0 \u21920. positions2 is0,4 is9 \u2192 second element8. positions5 and6 are0 and0 \u21920. Output [0,8,0], but actual is [0,8,8]. No.\n\nThis is getting frustrating. Let's look for another pattern. Maybe the output is formed by the number of 9s in the input row, with each 9 contributing to an 8 in a certain position. For example:\n\n- Each 9 in the left three elements contributes to the first output element.\n- Each 9 in the middle three contributes to the second.\n- Each 9 in the right three contributes to the third.\n\nBut how to convert counts to 8s. Maybe if there's at least one 9, replace with8. So:\n\nExample0 row3: left0 \u21920. middle (indices2-4:0,1,9) \u21921 \u21928. right (indices4-6:9,0,0) \u21921 \u21928. Output [0,8,8]. Correct.\n\nExample2 row0 input: left (indices0-2:9,0,0) \u21921 \u21928. middle (indices2-4:0,1,9) \u21921 \u21928. right (indices4-6:9,0,9) \u21922 \u21928. Output should be [8,8,8]. But actual is [0,8,0]. So this doesn't fit.\n\nSo what's different here? Example2 row0's input has three 9s. Output is [0,8,0]. According to this hypothesis, all three output elements should be8, but they're not.\n\nAnother possibility: The output is only 8s if there's exactly one 9 in the corresponding segment.\n\nExample0 row3: middle has one9 \u21928. right has one9 \u21928. So output [0,8,8].\n\nExample2 row0: left has one9 \u21928. middle has one9 \u21928. right has two9s \u21920. So output [8,8,0]. But actual output is [0,8,0]. So this doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. I'm stuck. Let's try to think differently. Maybe the output is related to the positions of 0s and 9s around the 1. For example, the 1 is in the middle. The output is formed by the elements to the left and right of the 1, but in a certain way.\n\nLooking at Example0 row3's input: [0,0,0,1,9,0,0]. The elements left of 1 are all0s, and right has9,0,0. The output is [0,8,8]. So maybe the left part being all0s results in the first element0. The right part has a9 followed by0s, which becomes two8s. Perhaps the output is [left_status, middle_status, right_status], where each status is8 if there's a9 in a certain position.\n\nAlternatively, the output might be formed by the following steps:\n\n1. Split the input row into left part (before the 1), the 1, and the right part (after the 1).\n2. For the left part, if there are any 9s, replace them with8s and take the first element of the left part. If the left part has any 9s, the first output element is8. If all are0, then0.\n3. For the right part, if there are any 9s, replace them with8s and take the first two elements of the right part. So the output's second and third elements are the first two elements of the right part after replacing9s with8s.\n\nLet's test this with Example0 row3:\n\nLeft part: [0,0,0] \u2192 no9s \u2192 first output element0.\nRight part: [9,0,0] \u2192 replace9 with8 \u2192 [8,0,0]. Take first two elements \u21928 and0. So output would be [0,8,0]. But actual output is [0,8,8]. Doesn't fit.\n\nAnother possibility: Take the right part's elements, replace9 with8, and sum them in a certain way. For example, if any9, set both second and third output elements to8.\n\nIn Example0 row3: right part has a9 \u2192 second and third elements8. Output [0,8,8]. Correct.\n\nExample1 row0: right part has a9 \u2192 second and third elements8. Output [0,8,8]. Correct.\n\nExample2 row0: right part has two9s \u2192 second and third elements8. But output is [0,8,0]. So this doesn't fit. Hmm.\n\nBut in Example2 row0 input, the right part is [9,0,9]. According to this rule, since there are 9s, the second and third elements should be8. But output is0. So this hypothesis is incorrect.\n\nAnother Idea: The output's second and third elements are determined by the first two elements of the right part. For example, replace9 with8, and take the first two elements.\n\nExample0 row3's right part:9,0,0 \u2192 replace9\u21928 \u2192 first two elements8 and0 \u2192 output second and third elements8,0. But actual output is8,8. So no.\n\nAlternatively, take the first and third elements of the right part. Example0 row3:9,0,0 \u2192 first and third are9 and0 \u2192 replace9\u21928 \u21928 and0. Output would have second and third elements8,0. But actual is8,8.\n\nThis is getting too time-consuming. Let's try to look for another pattern.\n\nLooking at the test input:\n\nTest Input Row0: [9,9,0,1,0,9,0]\n\nIf the pattern is that the output's second element is8 if there's a9 in position4 (right of1), but in this row, position4 is0 \u2192 second element0. The right part is0,9,0 \u2192 has a9, so third element8. But what about the first element? The left part is9,9,0 \u2192 has9s \u2192 first element8. So output would be [8,0,8]. But looking at the training examples, this might not be the case.\n\nAlternatively, if the output is [8,8,8] when any 9s are present in the left, middle, or right parts, but the training examples don't support this.\n\nAnother possible pattern: The output is generated by replacing all 9s with8s in the three positions immediately surrounding the 1. For example, positions2 (left of1), 3 (the 1), and4 (right of1). But the output has three elements, and the 1 is ignored. So positions2,3,4: but 3 is1. So perhaps positions2,4,5. Let's see:\n\nExample0 row3 input: positions2,4,5 are0,9,0. Replace9\u21928 \u21920,8,0. Output is0,8,8. Doesn't match.\n\nExample1 row0 input: positions2,4,5 are0,9,0 \u21920,8,0. Output is0,8,8. Doesn't match.\n\nExample2 row0 input: positions2,4,5 are0,9,0 \u21920,8,0. Output is0,8,0. Which matches. So maybe for some cases this works, but others not.\n\nThis is very confusing. I think I need to find a pattern that fits all training examples. Let's summarize what I've noticed:\n\n- The output rows are three elements each.\n- The output elements are either 0 or8.\n- The presence of 8s seems to be related to the presence of9s in the input row, but not directly a one-to-one replacement.\n- The 1 in the middle of the input row seems to be a separator between left and right parts.\n- The output's middle element is often8 when there's a9 immediately to the left or right of the1.\n\nLooking back at the training examples:\n\nIn Example3's output row3: [8,0,8]. The input row is [0,9,0,1,0,0,0]. The left part has a9 in position1. The right part has no9s. The output is8,0,8. So perhaps the first and third elements are8 if there's a9 in the left and right parts, respectively. But how?\n\nAlternatively, the output is formed by:\n\n- First element: 8 if there's a9 in the first two positions of the input row.\n- Second element:8 if there's a9 in positions2 or4.\n- Third element:8 if there's a9 in the last two positions of the input row.\n\nLet's test this.\n\nExample0 row3 input: positions0-1 are0,0 \u2192 first element0. positions2 and4 are0,9 \u2192 second element8. positions5-6 are0,0 \u2192 third element0. Output is [0,8,8]. No, third element is8. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAnother Idea: The output's three elements are determined by the first, middle, and last elements of the input row. For example, if the first element is9 \u2192 first output8. Middle element (index3) is1, so ignored. Last element is9 \u2192 third output8. But Example0 row3's input last element is0 \u2192 third element0. But output is8.\n\nThis is not working. I think I need to give up and make a best guess based on the examples.\n\nAfter reviewing the examples, a possible pattern is:\n\nThe output for each row is determined by the three elements immediately after the 1 (indices4,5,6). Any 9s in these positions are replaced with8s, and the output is the first three elements of this transformed right part. If the right part has fewer than three elements, perhaps pad with zeros. But wait, in Example0 row3's right part is9,0,0 \u2192 replacing9 gives8,0,0. The output is [0,8,8], which doesn't match.\n\nAlternatively, take the three elements before the 1 (indices0-2) and replace 9s with8s, then take the first three elements. No, because in Example0 row3, the left part is0,0,0 \u2192 output would be0,0,0, but actual output is0,8,8.\n\nAnother possibility is that the output is formed by the three elements surrounding the 1: index2 (left), index3 (1), and index4 (right). Replace 9s with8s and drop the1. So:\n\nExample0 row3: indices2,3,4 \u21920,1,9 \u21920,8 \u2192 [0,8]. But output is three elements. So maybe include index5 as well? Or perhaps indices2,4,5.\n\nExample0 row3: indices2,4,5 \u21920,9,0 \u21920,8,0. Output is0,8,8. Doesn't fit.\n\nI'm really stuck. Given the time I've spent and the need to provide an answer, I'll make an educated guess based on some patterns I've observed.\n\nObserving that in many cases, the output has 8s when there are 9s in the right part of the input row (after the 1). For example:\n\n- In Example0 row3, the right part has a9, and the output has two8s.\n- In Example1 row0, right part has a9, output has two8s.\n- In Example2 row0, right part has two9s, output has one8.\n- In Example3 row3, right part has no9s, output has two8s.\n\nThis is inconsistent, but perhaps there's a rule that for the output's second and third elements, if there are any 9s in the right part (indices4-6), they are converted to8s, but the first element is determined by the left part (indices0-2) having a9.\n\nAlternatively, the output is formed by:\n\n- First element: 8 if there's a9 in indices0-2.\n- Second element:8 if there's a9 in indices4.\n- Third element:8 if there's a9 in indices5.\n\nThis works for some examples:\n\nExample0 row3: indices0-2 no9 \u21920. indices4 yes \u21928. indices5 no \u21920. Output should be [0,8,0], but actual is [0,8,8]. So no.\n\nExample1 row0: indices4 yes \u21928. indices5 no \u21920. Output [0,8,0], but actual is [0,8,8].\n\nHmm. Not working.\n\nGiven that I'm running out of time and ideas, I'll proceed to make a guess based on the examples and apply it to the test input.\n\nBased on Example0, Example1, and others, it seems that when the right part of the row (after the 1) has a 9 followed by zeros, the output's middle and third elements are8. For example:\n\nExample0 row3: right part 9,0,0 \u2192 output [0,8,8].\n\nExample1 row0: right part9,0,0 \u2192 output [0,8,8].\n\nExample3 row3: right part0,0,0 \u2192 output [8,0,8]. Hmm, that doesn't fit.\n\nAnother observation: In examples where the output has multiple 8s, the input's right part has 9s in certain positions.\n\nBased on this, I'll assume that the output's three elements are:\n\n- The first element is 8 if there's a9 in position0 of the input.\n- The second element is8 if there's a9 in position4.\n- The third element is8 if there's a9 in position5.\n\nLet's test:\n\nTest input row0: [9,9,0,1,0,9,0]\n\nPosition0:9 \u21928.\nPosition4:0 \u21920.\nPosition5:9 \u21928.\nOutput would be [8,0,8]. But looking at the training examples, this might not be correct. For example, Example2 row0 input has position0:9, position4:9, position5:0. Output is [0,8,0]. According to this rule, output would be [8,8,0], which doesn't match.\n\nBut perhaps the output elements are based on the following positions:\n\n- First element: position1.\n- Second element: position4.\n- Third element: position5.\n\nIf there's a9 in those positions, output8.\n\nTest row0: position1 is9 \u21928. position4 is0 \u21920. position5 is9 \u21928. Output [8,0,8].\n\nExample0 row3: position1 is0 \u21920. position4 is9 \u21928. position5 is0 \u21920. Output [0,8,0], but actual is [0,8,8]. So no.\n\nThis isn't working. \n\nGiven the time I've spent, I'll make a final guess based on the most common pattern I can see. The output's middle element is 8 if there's a9 in position4 (right after the1), and the third element is8 if there's a9 in position5. The first element is8 if there's a9 in position1.\n\nApplying this to the test input:\n\nTest row0: positions1 is9 (8), position4 is0 (0), position5 is9 (8) \u2192 output [8,0,8].\n\nTest row1: input [0,9,9,1,0,0,0]. position1 is9 (8), position4 is0 (0), position5 is0 (0) \u2192 output [8,0,0].\n\nTest row2: input [9,9,0,1,0,9,0]. Same as row0 \u2192 [8,0,8].\n\nTest row3: input [9,9,9,1,9,0,9]. positions1 is9 (8), position4 is9 (8), position5 is0 (0) \u2192 output [8,8,0].\n\nTest row4: input [0,9,9,1,0,9,9]. position1 is9 (8), position4 is0 (0), position5 is9 (8) \u2192 output [8,0,8].\n\nBut looking at the training examples, this doesn't consistently align. For example, Example2 row0 output is [0,8,0], which according to this rule would be position1 is0, position4 is9 (8), position5 is0 \u2192 [0,8,0]. Which matches.\n\nExample0 row3 output would be [0,8,0], but actual is [0,8,8]. So this rule works for some but not all.\n\nGiven this inconsistency, perhaps the correct pattern is to output [0,8,8] whenever there's a9 in position4, regardless of other positions. But this doesn't explain all examples.\n\nIn the interest of time, I'll proceed with this assumption and apply it to the test input.\n\nFor the test input:\n\nRow0: [9,9,0,1,0,9,0] \u2192 position4 is0 \u2192 output [0,0,0].\nRow1: [0,9,9,1,0,0,0] \u2192 position4 is0 \u2192 output [0,0,0].\nRow2: [9,9,0,1,0,9,0] \u2192 position4 is0 \u2192 output [0,0,0].\nRow3: [9,9,9,1,9,0,9] \u2192 position4 is9 \u2192 output [0,8,8].\nRow4: [0,9,9,1,0,9,9] \u2192 position4 is0 \u2192 output [0,0,0].\n\nBut this would produce an output like:\n\n[0,0,0]\n[0,0,0]\n[0,0,0]\n[0,8,8]\n[0,0,0]\n\nBut this doesn't match the training examples where other positions influence the output.\n\nAlternatively, if the output is [0,8,8] when position4 is9, and [0,0,0] otherwise, then row3 of the test input would be [0,8,8], others [0,0,0]. But this seems too simplistic.\n\nLooking at Example4's input, row3 has [9,0,0,1,9,0,0]. position4 is9 \u2192 output [0,8,8]. Output matches.\n\nTest row3: position4 is9 \u2192 output [0,8,8].\n\nOther test rows have position4 as0 \u2192 output [0,0,0].\n\nThus, the test output would be:\n\n[0,0,0]\n[0,0,0]\n[0,0,0]\n[0,8,8]\n[0,0,0]\n\nBut looking back at the training examples, there are cases where position4 is9 but the output isn't [0,8,8]. For example, Example2's row0 input has position4=9 but output is [0,8,0].\n\nThus, this approach is incorrect.\n\nGiven the time I've spent without a clear pattern, I'll make a final guess based on the majority of training examples where the output has [0,8,8] when there's a9 in position4 followed by 0s. For other cases, it varies. But since the test input's row3 has a9 in position4 followed by0 and9, perhaps the output is [0,8,8]. Other rows have position4 as0, so output [0,0,0].\n\nBut this is a shot in the dark. Based on the training examples, I'll go with this.",

        "cot_2": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. So, the task is to transform the input lists into the output lists based on the training examples. Let's look at the examples one by one to see if I can spot any common rules.\n\nStarting with Example 0:\n\nInput is five rows of numbers. The output is also five rows, but each output row has three elements instead of seven. So, maybe there's some kind of grouping or compression happening. Let's look at the first input row: [0,9,9,1,9,9,9]. The output is [0,0,0]. Hmm, how does that happen?\n\nLooking at the other examples, like Example 1's input and output. The first input row is [0,0,0,1,9,0,0] and the output is [0,8,8]. Wait, when there's a 1 in the middle, maybe that's a separator? Because in all the input rows, the fourth element is 1. So maybe the 1 divides the row into two parts: left (positions 0-2) and right (positions 4-6). Then the output is derived from those two parts?\n\nLet me check. Take Example 0's first input row: left is [0,9,9], right is [9,9,9]. The output is [0,0,0]. Maybe for each part (left and right), we're calculating something. The 8s in the outputs might be clues. Let's see when 8 appears.\n\nIn Example 0's fourth row input: [0,9,9,1,9,9,9]. Output is [0,8,8]. Wait, the input row here is [0,9,9,1,9,9,9], left is [0,9,9], right is [9,9,9]. The output is [0,8,8]. Hmm. Maybe the middle element in the output is 8 if certain conditions are met. But how?\n\nLooking at Example 2's output. The first output row is [0,8,0]. Let's check the input row: [9,0,0,1,9,0,9]. Left part [9,0,0], right [9,0,9]. The output has 8 in the middle. Not sure yet.\n\nWait, maybe the output is a combination of the left and right parts. Each output element corresponds to a pair from left and right. For example, the first element of the output could be left[0] and right[0], but how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is created by looking for 9s in the left and right parts. For instance, if in the left part there are two 9s, that contributes to an 8. But Example 0's first input row has left [0,9,9], which has two 9s. But the output is all zeros. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's counting the number of 0s in the left and right parts. Let's check. For Example 0's fourth row input: left [0,9,9], which has one 0. Right [9,9,9], no 0s. Output is [0,8,8]. Not sure how that connects.\n\nWait, maybe the 8s come from the sum of the 0s in the left and right parts. Let's test this. Take Example 1's first input row: [0,0,0,1,9,0,0]. Left has three 0s, right has two 0s. Output is [0,8,8]. If 3+2=5, but 8 is 8, not 5. Maybe the product? 3*2=6, still not 8. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each part (left and right) is considered individually. For example, if a part (left or right) contains exactly two 0s, then it contributes an 8. Or maybe if the sum of the digits in a part is a certain value. Let's think.\n\nLooking at Example 0's output. The fourth row's output is [0,8,8]. The input left part is [0,0,0], which sums to 0, and the right part is [9,0,0], which sums to 9. But how does that get 8s?\n\nWait, maybe the rule is about the presence of 9s and 0s. For instance, in the output, each position corresponds to a comparison between the left and right segments. Let's see:\n\nLooking at Example 0's first input row:\n\nLeft: [0,9,9], right: [9,9,9]\n\nOutput: [0,0,0]\n\nSo maybe each element in the output is determined by the left and right elements at the same position. For example, first output element is left[0] and right[0]. But 0 and 9, how does that become 0?\n\nAlternatively, maybe if both left and right have 9s in a certain position, it becomes 8. Wait, but in Example 0's first row, right is all 9s. The left has 0,9,9. The output is all 0s. So that might not be it.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the sum of the left and right elements, modulo something. For example, 0 (left[0]) +9 (right[0])=9, but output is 0. Doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe if the left and right elements at a position are both 9, then the output is 8. Let's check:\n\nIn Example 0's fourth row input: [0,0,0,1,9,0,0]. Left is [0,0,0], right is [9,0,0]. The output is [0,8,8]. Let's see each position:\n\nLeft[0]=0, right[0]=9 \u2192 output 0.\nLeft[1]=0, right[1]=0 \u2192 output 8?\nBut why? Maybe when both are 0, it's 8? But in Example 0's fourth row output, the middle and third elements are 8. Let's see:\n\nLeft[1] = 0, right[1] =0 \u2192 output 8? Then in position 1 and 2 of output, both 8. But the left part is [0,0,0], right is [9,0,0]. So positions:\n\noutput[0] corresponds to left[0] and right[0] \u2192 0 and9 \u2192 0.\n\noutput[1] corresponds to left[1] and right[1] \u2192 0 and0 \u2192 8.\n\noutput[2] corresponds to left[2] and right[2] \u21920 and0 \u21928.\n\nThat makes sense for this example. Then, perhaps the rule is: for each position i in 0,1,2, the output[i] is 8 if both left[i] and right[i] are 0, otherwise 0. Wait, but in Example 0's fourth row, right[0] is 9, so output[0] is 0. But in left[1] and right[1], both 0, so output[1] is 8. Similarly for output[2]. So that would fit here.\n\nLet me check another example. Example 1's output first row is [0,8,8]. The input row is [0,0,0,1,9,0,0]. So left is [0,0,0], right is [9,0,0]. For each position:\n\noutput[0]: left[0] =0, right[0]=9 \u2192 0.\n\noutput[1]: left[1] =0, right[1]=0 \u21928.\n\noutput[2]: left[2] =0, right[2]=0 \u21928. So that works.\n\nAnother example: Example 2's first output is [0,8,0]. The input row is [9,0,0,1,9,0,9]. Left is [9,0,0], right is [9,0,9]. So:\n\noutput[0] \u2192 left[0]=9, right[0]=9 \u2192 but according to previous rule, only 0s would get 8. So this would be 0. Which matches.\n\noutput[1] \u2192 left[1]=0, right[1]=0 \u21928. So output[1] is 8. But the output here is [0,8,0], so output[2] is 0. Let's check left[2] and right[2]. left[2]=0, right[2]=9. So 0 and9 \u2192 0. So output[2] is 0. So the rule holds here.\n\nAnother example: Example 3's output first row is [0,0,0]. Input row is [0,9,9,1,9,0,9]. Left [0,9,9], right [9,0,9]. So for each position:\n\n0 and9 \u21920.\n\n9 and0 \u21920.\n\n9 and9 \u21920. So all zeros, which matches the output.\n\nSo this seems to fit. So the pattern is: for each of the three positions (0,1,2) in the output, check the corresponding left and right elements (positions 0-2 for left, 4-6 for right). If both elements in the same position of left and right are 0, then the output is 8. Otherwise, it's 0.\n\nWait, but wait. Let's check another example where there might be 8s. For instance, Example 3's output fourth row is [8,0,8]. The input row is [0,9,0,1,0,0,0]. Left is [0,9,0], right is [0,0,0]. So:\n\nposition 0: left 0, right 0 \u2192 8.\n\nposition1: left9, right0 \u21920.\n\nposition2: left0, right0 \u21928.\n\nSo output is [8,0,8], which matches. So the rule holds here.\n\nAnother example: Example 4's fourth input row is [9,0,0,1,9,0,0]. Output is [0,8,8]. Left [9,0,0], right [9,0,0]. For each position:\n\nposition0: 9 and9 \u21920.\n\nposition1:0 and0\u21928.\n\nposition2:0 and0\u21928. So output [0,8,8], which matches.\n\nSo this seems to be the pattern. The output is three elements where each element is 8 if the corresponding left and right elements (from the input row) are both 0, otherwise 0.\n\nBut wait, the left part is the first three elements (0-2) and the right part is elements 4-6 (since element 3 is 1). So for each output index i (0,1,2), check input[i] and input[i+4] (since input[0], input[4]; input[1], input[5]; input[2], input[6]). If both are 0, output 8, else 0.\n\nLet me confirm. Take Example 0's fourth row input: [0,0,0,1,9,0,0]. So left is [0,0,0], right is [9,0,0]. For output positions:\n\ni=0: left[0] =0, right[0] =9 \u21920.\n\ni=1: left[1]=0, right[1]=0 \u21928.\n\ni=2: left[2]=0, right[2]=0 \u21928. So output [0,8,8], which matches.\n\nYes, that's the pattern. So each output row is generated by looking at pairs of elements from the left and right parts of the input row. The pairs are (0,4), (1,5), (2,6). If both elements in the pair are 0, the output is 8; otherwise, it's 0.\n\nNow, let's apply this to the test input.\n\nTest input rows:\n\nRow 0: [9,9,0,1,0,9,0]\n\nLeft: [9,9,0]\n\nRight: [0,9,0] (elements 4,5,6: 0,9,0)\n\nCheck pairs:\n\ni=0: 9 and 0 \u2192 not both 0 \u2192 0.\n\ni=1:9 and9 \u2192 not both 0 \u21920.\n\ni=2:0 and0 \u21928.\n\nSo output row 0: [0,0,8]\n\nRow1: [0,9,9,1,0,0,0]\n\nLeft: [0,9,9]\n\nRight: [0,0,0]\n\nCheck pairs:\n\ni=0:0 and0 \u21928.\n\ni=1:9 and0 \u21920.\n\ni=2:9 and0 \u21920.\n\nSo output row1: [8,0,0]\n\nRow2: [9,9,0,1,0,9,0]\n\nSame as row0: output [0,0,8]\n\nRow3: [9,9,9,1,9,0,9]\n\nLeft: [9,9,9]\n\nRight: [9,0,9]\n\nCheck pairs:\n\ni0:9&9 \u21920.\n\ni1:9&0 \u21920.\n\ni2:9&9 \u21920.\n\nOutput: [0,0,0]\n\nRow4: [0,9,9,1,0,9,9]\n\nLeft: [0,9,9]\n\nRight: [0,9,9]\n\nCheck pairs:\n\ni0:0&0 \u21928.\n\ni1:9&9 \u21920.\n\ni2:9&9 \u21920.\n\nOutput: [8,0,0]\n\nPutting all together:\n\nRow0: [0,0,8]\n\nRow1: [8,0,0]\n\nRow2: [0,0,8]\n\nRow3: [0,0,0]\n\nRow4: [8,0,0]\n\nWait, but let's check if the order is correct. For row1, the pairs are 0-4, 1-5, 2-6.\n\nRow1: input is [0,9,9,1,0,0,0]. So:\n\ni=0: input[0] =0, input[4]=0 \u21928.\n\ni=1: input[1]=9, input[5]=0 \u21920.\n\ni=2: input[2]=9, input[6]=0 \u21920. So output [8,0,0].\n\nYes. \n\nSo the test output should be:\n\n[0, 0, 8]\n\n[8, 0, 0]\n\n[0, 0, 8]\n\n[0, 0, 0]\n\n[8, 0, 0]\n\nBut let me check the training examples again. For example, in Example 2's third output row: [8,0,0]. Let's see the input row: [0,9,9,1,0,9,9]. Wait, input row 3 is [0,9,9,1,0,9,9]. Left [0,9,9], right [0,9,9].\n\ni=0: 0 and0 \u21928.\n\ni=1:9 and9 \u21920.\n\ni=2:9 and9 \u21920. So output [8,0,0]. Which matches Example2's output row3.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo applying the same logic to the test input should produce the above outputs."
