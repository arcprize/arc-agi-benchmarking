        "cot_1": "Okay, let's see. I need to figure out the pattern here based on the training examples. Let's go through each example one by one and try to find a common rule.\n\nStarting with Example 0:\nInput:\n[4,4,4]\n[2,3,2]\n[2,3,3]\n\nOutput:\n[5,5,5]\n[0,0,0]\n[0,0,0]\n\nHmm. The output has [5,5,5] in the first row, and the other two are zeros. Let me check the input. The first row is all 4s. The second and third rows have a mix of numbers. Maybe there's something about the rows where all elements are the same. In the input, the first row is all the same (4s), and the output's first row is 5s. Then the other rows aren't all the same, so they become zeros. But wait, in Example 0's input, the third row is [2,3,3], which isn't all the same, so output is zeros. But maybe the key is that the first row is the only row with all elements equal. So perhaps the rule is: for each row, if all elements are the same, replace it with 5s, otherwise replace with 0s. But wait, let's check other examples.\n\nLooking at Example 1:\nInput:\n[7,3,3] \u2192 not all same.\n[6,6,6] \u2192 all same.\n[3,7,7] \u2192 not all same.\n\nOutput:\n[0,0,0]\n[5,5,5]\n[0,0,0]\n\nYes, here the middle row is all 6s, so becomes 5s. Others are 0s. That fits the initial thought.\n\nExample 2:\nInput:\n[2,9,2] \u2192 not all same.\n[4,4,4] \u2192 all same.\n[9,9,9] \u2192 all same.\n\nOutput:\n[0,0,0]\n[5,5,5]\n[5,5,5]\n\nSo both the second and third rows are all same, so they become 5s. The first row is 0s. That makes sense.\n\nExample 3:\nInput:\n[2,2,4] \u2192 not all same (wait, first two are 2, last is 4. So no.)\nWait, the first row in input of Example 3 is [2,2,4], which is not all same. Second row [2,2,4] same as first. Third row is [1,1,1], all same. Output has third row as 5s, others 0s. That aligns with the pattern.\n\nSo the pattern seems to be: For each row in the input, if all elements in the row are the same, then the output row is [5,5,5]. Otherwise, the output row is [0,0,0].\n\nBut wait, let me check if there's more to it. For example, in Example 0, the first input row is [4,4,4], so output is [5,5,5]. Similarly in Example 1, the middle row [6,6,6] becomes 5s. So that's consistent.\n\nSo applying this to the Test Input:\n\nTest Input:\n[4,4,4] \u2192 all same \u2192 becomes [5,5,5]\n[3,2,3] \u2192 elements are 3,2,3 \u2192 not all same \u2192 [0,0,0]\n[8,8,8] \u2192 all same \u2192 [5,5,5]\n\nSo the output should be:\n\n[5,5,5]\n[0,0,0]\n[5,5,5]\n\nWait, but looking back at the training examples, sometimes when multiple rows are all same, like in Example 2, both the middle and bottom rows become 5s. So the order in which rows are processed is just row by row. So yes, each row is considered independently.\n\nTherefore, the test input's first row is all 4s \u2192 5s. Second row not \u2192 0s. Third row all 8s \u21925s. So the output should be:\n\n[5,5,5]\n[0,0,0]\n[5,5,5]\n\nBut let me check if there's any other pattern. For example, maybe the 5s are based on the value in the input. Like, maybe if the row is all the same, then subtract 9 or something. Wait, in Example 0, 4 becomes 5. So 4+1=5. But in Example 1, 6 becomes 5. So 6-1=5. Example 2's rows with 4 and 9 \u2192 5. Hmm, that doesn't add up. 4+1=5, 9-4=5? That seems inconsistent. So maybe the 5 is a fixed number regardless of the input's number. So regardless of the value, if all elements are same in a row, replace with 5s. Otherwise 0s. That seems to be the case.\n\nYes, so the pattern is: for each row, check if all elements are the same. If yes, output [5,5,5]. Else [0,0,0].\n\nSo applying this to the test input:\n\nFirst row [4,4,4] \u2192 all same \u2192 5s.\n\nSecond row [3,2,3] \u2192 elements not all same \u2192 0s.\n\nThird row [8,8,8] \u2192 all same \u21925s.\n\nSo output is:\n\n[5,5,5]\n[0,0,0]\n[5,5,5]",

        "cot_2": "Okay, let's look at these training examples to figure out the pattern. So, each input is a 3x3 grid of numbers, and the output is another 3x3 grid where some rows are [5,5,5] and others are [0,0,0]. My job is to find out which rows get transformed to 5s and which to 0s.\n\nStarting with Example 0:\n\nInput:\n[4,4,4]\n[2,3,2]\n[2,3,3]\n\nOutput:\n[5,5,5]\n[0,0,0]\n[0,0,0]\n\nSo the first row becomes 5s, the others 0s. Looking at the input rows. The first row is all 4s. The second row has 2,3,2, which is not all the same. The third row is 2,3,3\u2014again, not all same. So maybe the first row is all the same numbers, so it becomes 5s. But in the output, that's the only 5s row. Wait, but in the output of Example 1, the middle row is 5s. Let's check that.\n\nExample 1 Input:\n[7,3,3]\n[6,6,6]\n[3,7,7]\n\nOutput:\n[0,0,0]\n[5,5,5]\n[0,0,0]\n\nHere, the middle row is all 6s, so that's turned into 5s. The other rows are not all the same. So maybe the rule is: for each row, if all elements are the same, replace them with 5s. Otherwise, replace with 0s. But wait in Example 0, the first row is all 4s and becomes 5s, which fits. But Example 2:\n\nExample 2 Input:\n[2,9,2]\n[4,4,4]\n[9,9,9]\n\nOutput:\n[0,0,0]\n[5,5,5]\n[5,5,5]\n\nThe second and third rows are all same (4s and 9s), so they become 5s. The first row has mixed, so 0s. That makes sense. Example 3:\n\nInput:\n[2,2,4]\n[2,2,4]\n[1,1,1]\n\nOutput:\n[0,0,0]\n[0,0,0]\n[5,5,5]\n\nOnly the third row is all same (1s), becomes 5s. The others are mixed. So the pattern seems to be: for each row, if all elements are equal, replace with 5s, else replace with 0s. But wait, let's check the outputs again. Yes, that's exactly what's happening. So each row in the output is [5,5,5] if the input row has all the same numbers, else [0,0,0].\n\nWait, but in Example 0, the third row is [2,3,3]. That's not all the same. So yes, output 0s. Similarly, other examples fit. So the transformation is: for each row, check if all elements are identical. If yes, output [5,5,5], else [0,0,0].\n\nTesting this pattern on the test input:\n\nTest Input:\n[4,4,4] \u2192 all same \u2192 [5,5,5]\n[3,2,3] \u2192 not all same \u2192 [0,0,0]\n[8,8,8] \u2192 all same \u2192 [5,5,5]\n\nWait, but in the output examples, sometimes there are multiple rows with 5s. Like Example 2, two rows are 5s. So applying this to the test input, the first and third rows are all same. So their output should be:\n\n[5,5,5]\n[0,0,0]\n[5,5,5]\n\nBut looking at the training examples, when a row is all same, it's 5s, else 0s. So that's the rule. But wait, let's check again. For example, in Example 3, the third row is [1,1,1] \u2192 becomes [5,5,5], others are 0s. So yes, that's the case.\n\nBut wait, in the test input, the first row is [4,4,4], which is all same \u2192 5s. The second row is [3,2,3] \u2192 not all same \u2192 0s. The third row is [8,8,8] \u2192 all same \u2192 5s. So the output should be:\n\n[5,5,5]\n[0,0,0]\n[5,5,5]\n\nBut looking at the training examples, Example 0 had the first row as 4s \u2192 5s, others 0s. So in the test input, the first and third rows would be 5s. But let me check the training examples again. Wait, Example 2's output has two rows as 5s because those two input rows were all same. So this seems correct. So the answer should be:\n\n[5,5,5]\n[0,0,0]\n[5,5,5]\n\nBut wait, the output in the examples always had the rows with 5s in a certain order. Let me check the training examples again. For example, in Example 0, the first row becomes 5s. In Example 1, the middle row becomes 5s. Example 2: middle and third rows. So the order in the output is based on which input rows were all same. So in the test case, first and third rows are all same, so their corresponding output rows should be 5s. So the output would be:\n\n[5,5,5]\n[0,0,0]\n[5,5,5]\n\nYes, that makes sense. So the answer should have the first and third rows as 5s and the middle as 0s."
