        "cot_1": "Okay, let's see here. I need to figure out the pattern that transforms the input matrices into the output ones. Let's look at the training examples closely.\n\nStarting with Example 0. The input is a 3x3 matrix:\n\n[6, 1, 0]\n[3, 0, 0]\n[0, 0, 0]\n\nThe output is a 6x6 matrix. Looking at the output rows, they seem to shift the original rows in some way. The first output row is [6,1,0,0,0,0], which is the first input row followed by three zeros. The second output row starts with 3, then the first row's elements? Wait, no. Let's see:\n\nOriginal input rows:\n\nRow 0: [6,1,0]\n\nRow 1: [3,0,0]\n\nRow 2: [0,0,0]\n\nOutput rows:\n\nRow 0: [6,1,0,0,0,0] \u2014 same as input row 0 with three zeros added.\n\nRow 1: [3,6,1,0,0,0] \u2014 starts with 3 (input row1[0]), then 6,1,0 (input row0 elements), then zeros.\n\nRow 2: [0,3,6,1,0,0] \u2014 starts with 0 (input row2[0]), then 3,6,1 (input row1 and row0 elements?), but wait. Maybe there's a shift here. Let me check the next rows.\n\nRow3 of output: [0,0,3,6,1,0] \u2014 shifts again. So each subsequent row shifts the elements to the right, and maybe combines elements from different input rows.\n\nLooking at Example 1:\n\nInput:\n[0,4,0]\n[0,8,0]\n[2,0,0]\n\nOutput:\n[0,4,0,0,0,0]\n[0,8,4,0,0,0]\n[2,0,8,4,0,0]\n[0,2,0,8,4,0]\n[0,0,2,0,8,4]\n[0,0,0,2,0,8]\n\nHere, the first output row is the first input row plus zeros. The second output row starts with the second input row's first element (0), then 8 (second row's second element?), then 4 (first row's second element?), then zeros. Hmm. Wait the second output row is [0,8,4,0,0,0]. So input row1 is [0,8,0], so perhaps taking the first element (0), then the elements from row0 shifted? Like row0 starts at position 1 here: 8 is row1's second element, then 4 is row0's second element. Not sure. Let's see.\n\nAnother approach: The output matrix's size is 6x6, which is double the input's 3x3. Maybe each input row is used to generate two output rows, but that doesn't fit exactly. Alternatively, the output is constructed by shifting each input row and stacking them with some overlapping.\n\nLooking at the output matrices, they seem to be constructed by diagonally shifting each input row. For example, in Example 0's output:\n\nEach output row after the first seems to be a shifted version of the previous, inserting elements from the input rows. Let's see:\n\nRow0: input row0 with zeros.\n\nRow1: input row1's first element (3) followed by input row0's elements (6,1,0), then zeros.\n\nRow2: starts with input row2's first element (0) followed by input row1's first element (3), then input row0's elements (6,1), then zeros.\n\nWait, but row2 is [0,3,6,1,0,0]. So after 0, we have 3,6,1. So maybe each next row takes the previous elements and shifts, but perhaps each column in the output is built by combining elements from different input rows in a staggered way.\n\nAnother idea: The output matrix is created by shifting each input row to the right by its row index. For example, input row 0 shifts 0 times, row1 shifts once, row2 shifts twice. But how does that expand to 6 rows?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is a Toeplitz matrix where each row is a shifted version of the input rows combined. Let's think of Toeplitz matrices where each row is a shifted version of the previous. But how do the input rows contribute?\n\nLooking at Example 0's output:\n\nThe output's first element is 6. The second row starts with 3, then 6. The third row starts with 0, then 3, then 6, then 1. Wait, but in the output rows:\n\nRow0: [6,1,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow1: [3,6,1,0,0,0]\n\nRow2: [0,3,6,1,0,0]\n\nRow3: [0,0,3,6,1,0]\n\nRow4: [0,0,0,3,6,1]\n\nRow5: [0,0,0,0,3,6]\n\nIt looks like each subsequent row is shifted right by one, and the elements after the first are from the previous row. So the first column is [6,3,0,0,0,0], then the next column is [1,6,3,0,0,0], etc. So perhaps each column is a shifted version of the input rows concatenated together. But how does the input map to this?\n\nAlternatively, the input matrix is being transformed into a larger matrix where each row is a combination of the input rows shifted. For example, the first output row is the first input row followed by zeros. The second row starts with the second input row's first element (3), then the first input row's first three elements (6,1,0). Then the third row starts with the third input row's first element (0), followed by the second input row's first element (3), then the first input row's elements (6,1,0), and so on. But how do the other elements get filled?\n\nWait in Example 0, input is 3 rows. The output has 6 rows. So each input row contributes two rows to the output? Because 3*2=6. Let's check:\n\nLooking at Example 0's output rows:\n\nRow0: input row0 extended with zeros.\n\nRow1: starts with input row1[0], then input row0's elements.\n\nRow2: starts with input row2[0], then input row1[0], then input row0's elements.\n\nRow3: starts with 0 (since input rows are exhausted?), then input row2[0], input row1[0], input row0's elements.\n\nWait, but input row2 is [0,0,0], so input row2[0] is 0. Then, for the third output row, maybe we have input row2's elements being shifted in. But this isn't exactly matching. Let me try another approach.\n\nLooking at the output matrix, each row after the first seems to start with the next element from the input's columns. Let me list the input matrices for all examples and see if there's a pattern.\n\nExample 0 Input:\n\nRow0: 6,1,0\n\nRow1:3,0,0\n\nRow2:0,0,0\n\nOutput rows are 6 in total. Each row seems to start with the next element from the first column of the input, then the previous elements shifted.\n\nWait, the first elements of each output row are 6,3,0,0,0,0. Which are the first elements of the input rows (6,3,0) followed by three zeros. Then the second elements of the output rows are 1,6,3,0,0,0. Wait, the second element of the first output row is 1 (from input row0[1]), second output row's second element is 6 (from input row0[0]). Third output row's second element is 3 (from input row1[0]). Fourth output row's second element is 0 (input row2[0]). Then zeros. Similarly, the third element in output rows: 0 (row0[2]), 1 (row0[1]), 6 (row0[0]), 3 (row1[0]), 0 (row2[0]), etc. So it looks like each subsequent element in the output rows is built by taking elements from the input columns, but shifted upwards.\n\nAlternatively, each column in the output is the transposed input's columns shifted down by the column index. Let me see:\n\nTake the input columns:\n\nFor example 0, input columns are:\n\nCol0: [6,3,0]\n\nCol1: [1,0,0]\n\nCol2: [0,0,0]\n\nNow, the output's first column is [6,3,0,0,0,0], which is col0 of input followed by zeros. The second column of output is [1,6,3,0,0,0]. Hmm, which is col1 of input (1,0,0) but then followed by col0 elements? Or perhaps, each column in the output is a shifted version of the input columns, but in a way that combines multiple columns.\n\nAlternatively, each element in the output matrix is formed by taking elements from the input matrix in a diagonal fashion. For example, output[i][j] is input[i - j][j] if i >= j and within bounds, else 0. Wait, maybe not.\n\nLooking at Example 0's output row 1: [3,6,1,0,0,0]. Here, output[1][0] is 3 (input[1][0]), output[1][1] is 6 (input[0][0]), output[1][2] is 1 (input[0][1]), output[1][3] is 0 (input[0][2]), then zeros. So for row 1, the elements are input[1][0], input[0][0], input[0][1], input[0][2], 0, 0.\n\nRow 2: [0,3,6,1,0,0]. Elements are 0 (input[2][0]), 3 (input[1][0]), 6 (input[0][0]), 1 (input[0][1]), 0 (input[0][2]?), but then 0. Hmm, not sure.\n\nAnother approach: Each output row is a concatenation of elements from the input matrix in a certain way. Let's index the output rows as 0 to 5. For each output row i, maybe the elements are constructed by taking the input row (i mod 3) and shifting it by floor(i/3). Wait, in Example 0, the output has 6 rows, so 0-5. For i=0: mod 3 is 0, shift 0. So row0 is input row0 plus zeros. For i=1: mod 3 is 1, shift 0. But input row1 is [3,0,0], but output row1 is [3,6,1,0,0,0]. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each output row is built by taking elements from the input matrix in a diagonal manner. For example, output row i includes elements from input rows 0 to 2, but shifted so that each starts at position i.\n\nWait, perhaps the output is created by stacking shifted versions of the input rows. For example, input row0 is placed as is in row0, then shifted right by 1 in row1, shifted right by 2 in row2, etc. But how do the other input rows come into play?\n\nLooking at Example 1's input:\n\n[0,4,0]\n\n[0,8,0]\n\n[2,0,0]\n\nOutput row1 is [0,8,4,0,0,0]. So row1 starts with input row1's first element (0), then input row1's second element (8), then input row0's second element (4). Then zeros. Hmm, maybe each output row after the first combines elements from the next input row and previous ones.\n\nWait, perhaps each output row i is formed by taking the input row (i - k) where k increases, but shifted. Let me think.\n\nIn Example 0, output row1 starts with input row1's first element, then input row0's first three elements. Output row2 starts with input row2's first element, then input row1's first element, then input row0's first two elements, and zeros. Output row3 starts with zeros, then input row2's first element, then input row1's first element, then input row0's elements. Wait, but the output rows are longer than the input rows. So maybe each output row is a combination of the input rows' elements shifted and concatenated.\n\nAlternatively, the output is a convolution of the input rows. But that's a stretch.\n\nAnother angle: The output matrix's size is 6x6, which is (3*2) x (3*2). Each input element is placed in the output matrix such that each element in the input is expanded into a 2x2 block. But the examples don't seem to follow that pattern. For example, in Example 0, input's 6 (row0, col0) appears in multiple positions in the output.\n\nAlternatively, the output is a circulant matrix generated from the input rows. A circulant matrix has each row vector rotated one element to the right relative to the preceding row vector. But the examples don't exactly match this. For instance, Example 0's output isn't a circulant matrix.\n\nWait, looking at the output rows, each row after the first is a right shift of the previous row, but with the first element coming from the next input row. For example:\n\nIn Example 0:\n\nRow0: [6,1,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow1: [3,6,1,0,0,0]\n\nRow2: [0,3,6,1,0,0]\n\nRow3: [0,0,3,6,1,0]\n\nRow4: [0,0,0,3,6,1]\n\nRow5: [0,0,0,0,3,6]\n\nNotice that after row0, each new row starts with the next element from the first column of the input (3, then 0, then 0, etc.), and the rest of the elements are the previous row shifted right. But how are the elements after the first determined?\n\nAlternatively, each row in the output is formed by taking the first column elements of the input in reverse order and then shifting. For example, the first column of the input is [6,3,0], and the first elements of the output rows are [6,3,0,0,0,0]. Then, the second elements of the output rows seem to follow [1,6,3,0,0,0], which could be the second column elements [1,0,0] but shifted and combined with previous elements. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the output matrix is built by stacking the input rows in a way that each subsequent row is shifted right and the new elements are taken from the next input row. For example, the first output row is input row0 followed by zeros. The second output row starts with input row1[0], then input row0's elements, then zeros. The third starts with input row2[0], then input row1[0], then input row0's elements, and zeros. Then, after that, the fourth row starts with 0, then input row2[0], input row1[0], input row0's elements, etc. But how does this explain the rest of the elements?\n\nIn Example 0's row1: [3,6,1,0,0,0], after 3 (row1[0]), the next elements are 6,1,0, which are row0's elements. Then zeros. So maybe each row after the first starts with the next row's first element, then appends the previous output row's elements truncated by one.\n\nFor instance:\n\nRow0: input row0 + zeros.\n\nRow1: input row1[0] followed by row0's elements, then zeros. But row0's elements are 6,1,0, so after 3, we have 6,1,0, then two zeros (but the output row1 has 6,1,0 followed by two zeros, but the output row1 has 6 elements. Wait, input row0 is 3 elements. So row1 would be [3] + row0 + [0,0,0], but that's 1+3+3=7 elements, which doesn't fit. So perhaps there's a shift.\n\nAnother observation: The output matrix in all examples has the same number of rows as the number of elements in the input matrix. Wait, input is 3x3, 9 elements, but output is 6x6, 36 elements. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, the output has twice the number of rows as the input. Since input is 3 rows, output is 6 rows. Each input row generates two output rows. Let's check:\n\nExample 0:\n\nInput rows 0,1,2. Output rows 0,1,2,3,4,5. So maybe input row i corresponds to output rows i*2 and i*2+1. But looking at the output rows, this doesn't hold. For example, output row0 is derived from input row0, row1 from row1, row2 from row2, then rows3-5 seem to be shifted versions of previous rows.\n\nAlternatively, the output is formed by creating a lower triangular matrix with the input's columns, then shifting. Let's look at the first example.\n\nAnother approach: For each input row, we create a diagonal in the output matrix. For example, input row0's elements are placed along the main diagonal, shifted by some amount. Then input row1's elements are placed along another diagonal, and so on. But the examples don't exactly show this.\n\nWait, let's look at Example 1's output:\n\n[0,4,0,0,0,0]\n\n[0,8,4,0,0,0]\n\n[2,0,8,4,0,0]\n\n[0,2,0,8,4,0]\n\n[0,0,2,0,8,4]\n\n[0,0,0,2,0,8]\n\nHere, the first input row is [0,4,0], the second is [0,8,0], third is [2,0,0].\n\nThe output's first row is the first input row with three zeros added.\n\nSecond row starts with 0 (second input row's first element), then 8 (second input row's second element), then 4 (first input row's second element), then zeros.\n\nThird row starts with 2 (third input row's first element), then 0 (third input row's second element?), then 8 (second input row's second element), then 4 (first input row's second element), then zeros.\n\nFourth row starts with 0 (maybe from the third input row's second element?), then 2 (third input row's first element?), then 0 (third input row's second element), then 8 (second input row's second element), then 4 (first input row's second element), then 0.\n\nHmm, not sure. Maybe each output row is built by combining elements from the input rows in a cascading manner. For example, output row i takes elements from input rows in reverse order, each shifted by i positions.\n\nAlternatively, the output is generated by placing each input row in a diagonal manner, shifted by their row index. For example, input row0 is placed in the main diagonal, row1 in the next diagonal, etc., but expanded to fit the 6x6 matrix.\n\nBut I'm not seeing it clearly. Let me try to think of how the output rows are formed step by step for the test input.\n\nTest Input:\n\n[0, 0, 3]\n\n[0, 0, 0]\n\n[0, 4, 9]\n\nSo, the input is a 3x3 matrix. Following the pattern from training examples, the output should be a 6x6 matrix. Let's imagine how each row would look.\n\nLooking at the first example's output structure, the first row of the output is the first input row followed by three zeros. The second row starts with the second input row's first element, then elements from the first input row. The third row starts with the third input row's first element, then elements from the second and first input rows. Then, subsequent rows continue shifting and adding zeros.\n\nSo for the test input:\n\nInput rows:\n\nRow0: [0, 0, 3]\n\nRow1: [0,0,0]\n\nRow2: [0,4,9]\n\nOutput rows:\n\nRow0: [0,0,3,0,0,0] (row0 + three zeros)\n\nRow1: [0,0,0,3,0,0] ? No. Wait in Example1, row1's output starts with the second input row's first element. Here, row1's input is [0,0,0], so first element is 0. Then maybe followed by elements from row0. So row1 would be [0, 0 (from row1's first element?), then 0 (row0's first element?), 3 (row0's third element?), but this is unclear.\n\nAlternatively, let's try to apply the pattern observed in Example0:\n\nIn Example0's output, each row after the first starts with the next input row's first element, then the previous row's elements shifted right. But this doesn't exactly fit, but let's try.\n\nTest input:\n\nRow0: [0,0,3]\n\nRow1: [0,0,0]\n\nRow2: [0,4,9]\n\nExpected output:\n\nRow0: [0,0,3,0,0,0]\n\nRow1: [0,0,0,3,0,0] \u2014 but according to Example0's pattern, row1 starts with row1's first element (0) followed by row0's elements. So row1 would be [0, 0 (from row0?), 0 (row0?), 3 (row0's third element?), then zeros? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, let's think that each output row after the first is built by taking the next input row's first element, then the previous output row's elements shifted left. But not sure.\n\nAnother idea: The output matrix is built such that each row i is a combination of the input rows, shifted right by i positions. For example, row0 is input row0 shifted 0 times, row1 is input row1 shifted 0 times plus input row0 shifted 1 time, etc. But this is vague.\n\nAlternatively, the output matrix is constructed by arranging the input elements such that each element in the input is placed in the output matrix at positions (i+j, j) for some i. Let's see.\n\nIn Example0's input:\n\n6 is at (0,0). In the output, 6 is at (0,0), (1,1), (2,2), etc.\n\n3 is at (1,0) in input. In output, 3 is at (1,0), (2,1), (3,2), etc.\n\nBut in the output, 3 appears in row1 column0, row2 column1, row3 column2, etc.\n\nSimilarly, 1 is in input (0,1). In output, it's in row0 column1, row1 column2, row2 column3, etc.\n\nThis suggests that each input element at (i,j) is placed along a diagonal in the output starting at (i, j), then (i+1,j+1), etc. But how does this fit the output structure?\n\nFor example, input element 6 (i=0,j=0) appears in output positions (0,0), (1,1), (2,2), (3,3), (4,4), (5,5). But in the Example0 output, 6 is in (0,0), (1,1), (2,2), etc. Looking at the first few rows:\n\nRow0: 6 at (0,0).\n\nRow1: 6 at (1,1).\n\nRow2: 6 at (2,2).\n\nRow3: 6 at (3,3).\n\nSo that seems to fit. Similarly, input element 3 (i=1,j=0) appears in output positions (1,0), (2,1), (3,2), (4,3), (5,4). In Example0's output, row1 column0 is 3, row2 column1 is 3, row3 column2 is3, etc. Which matches.\n\nInput element 0 (i=2,j=0) appears in output positions (2,0), (3,1), (4,2), (5,3). In Example0's output, row2 column0 is0, row3 column1 is0, row4 column2 is0, etc. But in Example0, input row2 has [0,0,0], so their elements would be along their diagonals, but since they are 0, they don't show up except where the original input had non-zero.\n\nThis seems to fit. So the pattern is that each element in the input matrix is placed along a diagonal in the output matrix starting at its original position (i,j) in the input, and each subsequent element in the diagonal is the same as the input element. The output matrix's size is determined by the maximum possible diagonal length given the input size.\n\nWait, but the output matrix in the examples is 6x6. For a 3x3 input, the output is 6x6. Because each element's diagonal extends for (3+3-1) = 5 positions? Or perhaps it's simply doubling the size.\n\nBut according to this pattern, each input element (i,j) would create a diagonal in the output matrix starting at (i,j) and extending down-right. For example, input element at (0,0) would be at (0,0), (1,1), (2,2), etc., up to the matrix size. Similarly, (0,1) would be at (0,1), (1,2), (2,3), etc.\n\nIn Example0's output, the element 6 (0,0) appears at (0,0), (1,1), (2,2), (3,3), (4,4), (5,5), which is six positions. So the output matrix has enough rows and columns to accommodate all diagonals for the input elements. For a 3x3 input, the maximum diagonal would start at (2,2), extending down-right for 3 elements (since there are 3 rows and 3 columns), but the output matrix in the examples has 6 rows and 6 columns, which allows each diagonal to be extended to 6 elements.\n\nBut how does this fit with the examples? For instance, in Example0:\n\nInput element 6 (0,0) creates a diagonal of 6's: output[0][0], output[1][1], output[2][2], output[3][3], output[4][4], output[5][5].\n\nInput element 1 (0,1) creates a diagonal: output[0][1], output[1][2], output[2][3], output[3][4], output[4][5], output[5][6] (but output has only 6 columns, so stops at 5).\n\nSimilarly, input element 3 (1,0) creates diagonal at (1,0), (2,1), (3,2), (4,3), (5,4), (6,5) (but rows stop at 5).\n\nBut in Example0's output, the third row (row2) has [0,3,6,1,0,0]. The 3 here is at (2,1), which is part of the diagonal from input (1,0). The 6 is from input (0,0) at (2,2). The 1 is from input (0,1) at (2,3).\n\nSo this seems to align with the idea that each input element is placed along its diagonal. However, in the output matrix, the elements are overlapping. For example, output cell (2,2) is 6 from input (0,0), and output cell (2,1) is 3 from input (1,0), etc. So each output cell is the sum of all input elements whose diagonals pass through that cell? Or perhaps each cell is the sum of the input elements along that diagonal, but in the examples, there's no summation; instead, each cell is occupied by exactly one input element's diagonal. For instance, in Example0, output cell (1,1) is 6 (from input (0,0)), cell (1,0) is 3 (from input (1,0)), cell (0,1) is 1 (from input (0,1)), etc. So each output cell is the input element that starts the diagonal passing through that cell. But that doesn't explain the example outputs.\n\nAlternatively, each output cell (i,j) is the input element (i - j, j) if i - j is within 0 to 2 (input rows), else 0. But that doesn't seem to fit.\n\nWait, let's take cell (1,0) in Example0's output. i=1, j=0. i-j =1. So input row1, column0: 3. Which matches. Cell (2,1): i=2, j=1. i-j=1. So input row1, column1: 0. But in Example0's output, cell (2,1) is 3. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAnother possibility: output cell (i,j) is the input cell (j - i, i) if j >=i and within bounds. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the output matrix is a lower triangular matrix where each row i has the input row (i - k) elements shifted. This is getting too vague.\n\nPerhaps another approach is to look for the way the output is built for each example and find a common pattern.\n\nIn all examples:\n\n- The output has double the rows of the input (3 input rows \u2192 6 output rows).\n\n- The first output row is the first input row followed by zeros.\n\n- The second output row starts with the second input row's first element, followed by the first input row's elements shifted.\n\n- The third output row starts with the third input row's first element, followed by the second and first input row's elements shifted.\n\n- Then, subsequent rows start with zeros and include elements from previous input rows, each shifted further.\n\nFor example, in Example0:\n\nRow0: [6,1,0,0,0,0] \u2192 input row0 + zeros.\n\nRow1: [3,6,1,0,0,0] \u2192 input row1[0] followed by input row0's elements (6,1,0) shifted and filled with zeros.\n\nRow2: [0,3,6,1,0,0] \u2192 input row2[0] (0) followed by input row1[0] (3), then input row0's elements (6,1) shifted, and zeros.\n\nRow3: [0,0,3,6,1,0] \u2192 starts with 0 (no input row left), then input row2[0] (0), input row1[0] (3), input row0's elements (6,1) shifted.\n\nWait, but row3's elements are [0,0,3,6,1,0]. So after two zeros, it's 3,6,1, then 0. This pattern seems like each new row shifts right and includes elements from previous input rows, but it's not clear how.\n\nAlternatively, each output row after the first is formed by shifting the previous row to the right and prepending the next element from the input's first column. For example:\n\nRow0: input row0 + zeros.\n\nRow1: prepend input row1[0] (3) to row0's elements and drop the last element. So row0 is [6,1,0,0,0,0], prepend 3 \u2192 [3,6,1,0,0,0], but length is 6. Similarly, row2 is prepend input row2[0] (0) to row1's elements (3,6,1,0,0,0) shifted, resulting in [0,3,6,1,0,0]. Then row3 would prepend 0 (since there are no more input rows) \u2192 [0,0,3,6,1,0], and so on. \n\nThis seems to fit the examples. Let's verify:\n\nExample0:\n\nRow0: [6,1,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow1: prepend 3 \u2192 [3,6,1,0,0,0] (but input row1's first element is 3)\n\nRow2: prepend 0 (input row2's first element) \u2192 [0,3,6,1,0,0]\n\nRow3: prepend 0 (no input rows left, so 0?), but how? Maybe after input rows are exhausted, we continue prepending 0. So row3: [0,0,3,6,1,0]\n\nRow4: prepend 0 \u2192 [0,0,0,3,6,1]\n\nRow5: prepend 0 \u2192 [0,0,0,0,3,6]\n\nYes! This matches Example0's output.\n\nLet's check Example1:\n\nInput rows:\n\nRow0: [0,4,0]\n\nRow1: [0,8,0]\n\nRow2: [2,0,0]\n\nOutput rows:\n\nRow0: [0,4,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow1: prepend row1[0] (0) \u2192 [0,0,4,0,0,0] \u2014 but Example1's row1 output is [0,8,4,0,0,0]. Hmm, that doesn't fit. Wait, this approach works for Example0 but not Example1.\n\nWait in Example1's output row1: [0,8,4,0,0,0]. The first element is 0 (input row1's first element). But the second element is 8, which is input row1's second element. This contradicts the previous pattern.\n\nSo maybe the pattern isn't simply prepending the next input row's first element. Let's re-examine the examples.\n\nExample1's input:\n\nRow0: [0,4,0]\n\nRow1: [0,8,0]\n\nRow2: [2,0,0]\n\nOutput rows:\n\nRow0: [0,4,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow1: [0,8,4,0,0,0]\n\nRow2: [2,0,8,4,0,0]\n\nRow3: [0,2,0,8,4,0]\n\nRow4: [0,0,2,0,8,4]\n\nRow5: [0,0,0,2,0,8]\n\nIn row1, after the first element (0 from row1), the next elements are 8 (row1's second element?), then 4 (row0's second element?), then zeros.\n\nRow2 starts with 2 (row2's first element), then 0 (row2's second element?), then 8 (row1's second element), then 4 (row0's second element).\n\nRow3 starts with 0, then 2 (row2's first element), then 0 (row2's second element?), then 8 (row1's second element), then 4 (row0's second element).\n\nHmm. This suggests that each output row after the first combines elements from the current input row and the previous ones, but shifted.\n\nLooking at Example1's row1: [0,8,4,0,0,0]. The elements after the first 0 are 8,4. So row1's first element is input row1[0] =0. Then, perhaps the next elements are input row1's elements shifted left, followed by input row0's elements. For row1, input row1 is [0,8,0]. If we take elements after the first, then we have 8,0, and then input row0's elements [0,4,0], but not sure.\n\nAlternatively, each output row i is formed by taking the input rows in reverse order and shifting them by i positions.\n\nAlternatively, the pattern is that each output row i is built by taking input row (i - k) for k from 0 to i, and shifting each row right by k positions, then summing the elements. But since all examples have no overlapping non-zero elements, it's possible.\n\nFor example, in Example0's row1:\n\ninput row1 shifted by 0: [3,0,0,0,0,0]\n\ninput row0 shifted by 1: [0,6,1,0,0,0]\n\nSumming these gives [3,6,1,0,0,0], which matches row1's output.\n\nRow2 would be:\n\ninput row2 shifted by 0: [0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\ninput row1 shifted by 1: [0,3,0,0,0,0]\n\ninput row0 shifted by 2: [0,0,6,1,0,0]\n\nSumming these gives [0,3,6,1,0,0], which matches row2's output.\n\nRow3 would be:\n\ninput row2 shifted by 1: [0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\ninput row1 shifted by 2: [0,0,3,0,0,0]\n\ninput row0 shifted by 3: [0,0,0,6,1,0]\n\nSumming gives [0,0,3,6,1,0], which matches row3.\n\nThis seems to fit. So the pattern is that each output row is the sum of the input rows shifted right by (i - k), where i is the output row index and k ranges from 0 to the input row count minus 1, but only for k <= i.\n\nWait, more precisely, for each output row i, the elements are formed by placing each input row k at position i - k, shifted right by (i - k) positions, and then all overlapping elements are summed. But in the examples, there's no summation because the shifts don't overlap. Wait, in Example0's row1:\n\nRow1 is i=1. So for k=0 (input row0), shifted right by (1-0)=1 positions: [0,6,1,0,0,0]\n\nFor k=1 (input row1), shifted right by (1-1)=0 positions: [3,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nThese two are combined (summed) to give [3,6,1,0,0,0].\n\nSimilarly, row2 (i=2):\n\nk=0: shifted by 2 \u2192 [0,0,6,1,0,0]\n\nk=1: shifted by 1 \u2192 [0,3,0,0,0,0]\n\nk=2: shifted by 0 \u2192 [0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nSumming gives [0,3,6,1,0,0].\n\nYes! This makes sense. So the general pattern is:\n\nFor each output row i (0 \u2264 i < 2n, where n is the number of input rows), the output row is the sum of each input row k (0 \u2264 k < n) shifted right by (i - k) positions, with the shift being applied to the input row k. If the shift is negative, then it's not included (since shifting right by a negative number is a left shift, which isn't allowed here).\n\nBut since the input has 3 rows, output has 6 rows (3*2?), but why 6? Because for i from 0 to 5 (since 3 input rows would allow shifts up to i=5 for k=0, i=5-0=5 shifts). Wait, maybe the number of output rows is (n + len(input_row) -1) = 3+3-1=5? But in examples, it's 6 rows. Hmm, perhaps the output size is (n + m -1) where n is rows and m is columns. But input is 3x3, so n=3, m=3. So rows would be 3+3-1=5, but examples have 6. So maybe the output is double the size, 2n rows and 2m columns.\n\nBut in any case, the pattern seems to be that each output row is the superposition of the input rows shifted right by (i - k) positions for each k \u2264 i.\n\nApplying this to the test input:\n\nTest input:\n\nRow0: [0,0,3]\n\nRow1: [0,0,0]\n\nRow2: [0,4,9]\n\nSo n=3 rows. Output should have 6 rows.\n\nFor each output row i (0 to 5):\n\nOutput row i = sum of input row k shifted right by (i -k) positions for each k \u2264 i.\n\nLet's compute each output row:\n\nRow0 (i=0):\n\nk can be 0 (since 0 <= i=0).\n\nShift row0 by (0-0)=0 \u2192 [0,0,3,0,0,0].\n\nRow0 output: [0,0,3,0,0,0].\n\nRow1 (i=1):\n\nk=0: shift row0 by (1-0)=1 \u2192 [0,0,0,3,0,0].\n\nk=1: shift row1 by (1-1)=0 \u2192 [0,0,0,0,0,0].\n\nSumming: [0,0,0,3,0,0]. But according to training examples, row1's output starts with row1's first element. But here, row1's first element is 0. Wait, but according to the pattern, row1's output should be the sum of row0 shifted by 1 and row1 shifted by 0. So the sum is [0+0, 0+0, 0+0, 3+0, 0+0, 0+0] \u2192 [0,0,0,3,0,0]. But this doesn't match the training examples. For instance, in Example1, row1's output was [0,8,4,0,0,0], which would be row0 shifted by 1 ( [0,0,4,0,0,0] ) and row1 shifted by 0 ( [0,8,0,0,0,0] ). Summing gives [0,8,4,0,0,0], which matches. So this pattern holds.\n\nSo for the test input, row1's output should be row0 shifted by 1 ( [0,0,0,3,0,0] ) and row1 shifted by 0 ( [0,0,0,0,0,0] ), sum is [0,0,0,3,0,0]. But according to the training examples, the row1 output would start with the input row1's first element (0) followed by row0's elements. But according to this pattern, the sum is [0,0,0,3,0,0]. But this doesn't match the pattern observed in the training examples. So I must have made a mistake.\n\nWait, perhaps the shift is left instead of right. Let's re-examine Example0:\n\nRow0: [6,1,0], shifted right by 0 \u2192 [6,1,0,0,0,0].\n\nRow1: sum of row0 shifted by (1-0)=1 \u2192 [0,6,1,0,0,0], and row1 shifted by 0 \u2192 [3,0,0,0,0,0]. Summing gives [3,6,1,0,0,0], which matches. So the shift is to the right.\n\nBut in Example1's row1:\n\nRow0 shifted by 1 \u2192 [0,0,4,0,0,0], row1 shifted by 0 \u2192 [0,8,0,0,0,0]. Sum is [0,8,4,0,0,0], which matches.\n\nSo for the test input's row1:\n\nrow0 shifted by 1 \u2192 [0,0,0,3,0,0]\n\nrow1 shifted by 0 \u2192 [0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nSum: [0,0,0,3,0,0]. But according to the training examples, the second row would start with the second input row's first element. Here, row1's first element is 0. So row1's output would be [0,0,0,3,0,0]. But in the training examples, the second row includes the second input row's elements. So why is the row1's output in the test case not including row1's elements?\n\nAh, because the input's row1 is [0,0,0]. So when shifted by 0, it's [0,0,0,0,0,0]. So the sum is row0 shifted by 1 plus row1 shifted by 0. Which in this case, since row1 is all zeros, the sum is just row0 shifted by 1. So row1's output would be [0,0,0,3,0,0]. But according to the training examples, even if an input row has zeros, the pattern holds.\n\nBut let's proceed. Now row2 (i=2):\n\nk=0: row0 shifted by 2 \u2192 [0,0,0,0,3,0]\n\nk=1: row1 shifted by (2-1)=1 \u2192 [0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nk=2: row2 shifted by (2-2)=0 \u2192 [0,4,9,0,0,0]\n\nSum: [0,4,9,0,3,0]\n\nBut wait, adding these:\n\nrow0 shifted by 2: [0,0,0,0,3,0]\n\nrow1 shifted by 1: [0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nrow2 shifted by 0: [0,4,9,0,0,0]\n\nSum: [0+0+0, 0+0+4, 0+0+9, 0+0+0, 3+0+0, 0+0+0] \u2192 [0,4,9,0,3,0]\n\nBut according to the training examples, row2 should start with the third input row's first element (0) followed by the second row's first element (0), then the first row's elements. For example, in Example0's row2: [0,3,6,1,0,0], which is row2's first element (0), then row1's first element (3), then row0's elements (6,1).\n\nBut according to the current pattern, test row2 would be [0,4,9,0,3,0], which doesn't match the training examples' pattern. So perhaps this approach is incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the shift is left by (i - k) positions. Let's reevaluate.\n\nIn Example0's row1:\n\ni=1, k=0: shift left by 1 \u2192 [1,0,0,0,0,0], and k=1: shift left by 0 \u2192 [3,0,0,0,0,0]. Sum is [4,0,0,0,0,0], which doesn't match. So no, that's not correct.\n\nHmm, this is confusing. Maybe the pattern is not about shifting rows but columns. Let's think differently.\n\nLooking at the output matrices, they look like Toeplitz matrices where each column is a shifted version of the first column. But the first column of the output in Example0 is [6,3,0,0,0,0], and the second column is [1,6,3,0,0,0], etc. So each column is a shifted version of the first column. This is characteristic of a Toeplitz matrix. Similarly, the other examples fit this pattern.\n\nA Toeplitz matrix is a matrix where each descending diagonal from left to right is constant. In these examples, each diagonal (from top-left to bottom-right) contains the same value, which is an element from the input matrix's columns.\n\nFor example, in Example0:\n\nThe first column of the output is [6,3,0,0,0,0], which is the first column of the input followed by zeros. The second column is [1,6,3,0,0,0], which is the second column of the input's first element (1), followed by the first column of the input (6,3,0) shifted down by one. The third column is [0,1,6,3,0,0], which is the third column of the input's first element (0), followed by the second column's elements (1,6,3) shifted down, and so on.\n\nSo the pattern is that each column of the output is the corresponding column of the input, followed by the previous column's elements shifted down by one. This creates a Toeplitz matrix where each column is a shifted version of the previous.\n\nBut how does this relate to the input matrix?\n\nAlternatively, the output is a Toeplitz matrix generated from the first row and first column of the input. But since the input is a 3x3 matrix, perhaps the output's first row and column are derived from the input's first row and column, extended to length 6.\n\nBut in the examples, the output's first row is the input's first row plus zeros. The first column is the input's first column plus zeros. Then each subsequent element in the output is determined by the Toeplitz structure. For example, output[i][j] = output[i-1][j-1] if i>0 and j>0. But this doesn't fit the examples.\n\nAlternatively, the output is a convolution matrix. For instance, if the input represents a kernel, the output is a convolution matrix where each row represents a time-shifted version of the kernel. But this is getting too abstract.\n\nAlternatively, the output is constructed such that each row is a shifted version of the previous row, with new elements introduced from the input rows. For example, the first row is input row0 plus zeros. The second row is input row1 followed by input row0's elements shifted. The third row is input row2 followed by input row1's elements and input row0's elements shifted. Then, subsequent rows shift further, introducing zeros.\n\nIn this case, for the test input:\n\nRow0: [0,0,3,0,0,0]\n\nRow1: [0,0,0,3,0,0] (input row1 is [0,0,0], so after row0's shift, but this doesn't fit the training examples' pattern).\n\nThis approach seems not to hold.\n\nAnother idea: The output matrix is formed by placing each input row in a diagonal of the output matrix. For example, input row0 is placed along the main diagonal, row1 along the first sub-diagonal, row2 along the second sub-diagonal. Each row is extended to the right with zeros to fill the 6 columns.\n\nFor example, in Example0:\n\nInput row0: [6,1,0] \u2192 placed starting at (0,0), then extended with zeros \u2192 [6,1,0,0,0,0].\n\nInput row1: [3,0,0] \u2192 placed starting at (1,0), then extended \u2192 [3,0,0,0,0,0], but in the output, row1 is [3,6,1,0,0,0]. This doesn't fit.\n\nSo this approach is incorrect.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and not finding a clear pattern, perhaps I should consider that each input row is being used to generate a lower triangular matrix, and these are concatenated horizontally and vertically to form the output.\n\nAlternatively, the output is generated by shifting each input row to the right by its row index multiplied by the column index. Not sure.\n\nWait, looking back at the test input:\n\nInput:\n\n[0,0,3]\n\n[0,0,0]\n\n[0,4,9]\n\nExpected output according to the pattern:\n\nRow0: [0,0,3,0,0,0]\n\nRow1: [0,0,0,3,0,0]\n\nRow2: [0,4,9,0,3,0]\n\nRow3: [0,0,4,9,0,3]\n\nRow4: [0,0,0,4,9,0]\n\nRow5: [0,0,0,0,4,9]\n\nBut this doesn't match the training examples. For example, in Example2's input:\n\nInput row0: [0,0,6]\n\nOutput row0: [0,0,6,0,0,0]\n\nRow1: [1,3,0,6,0,0] (input row1: [1,3,0])\n\nRow2: [0,1,3,0,6,0]\n\nRow3: [0,0,1,3,0,6]\n\nRow4: [0,0,0,1,3,0]\n\nRow5: [0,0,0,0,1,3]\n\nThis suggests that after the first input row is placed in the first row, the subsequent rows are built by taking the next input row's elements and shifting them, appending the previous rows' elements. For example, row1 starts with input row1's elements, followed by input row0's elements shifted. Then, row2 starts with input row2's elements, followed by input row1's elements and input row0's elements shifted.\n\nSo for the test input:\n\nRow0: [0,0,3,0,0,0]\n\nRow1: [0 (row1's first element), 0,0 (row1's elements) followed by row0's elements shifted? No, but row1's input is [0,0,0], so row1's output would be [0,0,0,3,0,0].\n\nRow2: input row2 is [0,4,9], so row2 would start with 0,4,9, then input row1's elements shifted (0,0,0), then input row0's elements shifted (3). But the output row2 would be [0,4,9,0,0,3].\n\nBut the previous examples show that after the input rows are exhausted, the subsequent rows continue shifting the existing elements. For example, in Example0's row3: [0,0,3,6,1,0] which is a shift of row2's elements.\n\nPerhaps the pattern is:\n\nThe output matrix is constructed by first placing each input row in the first few rows, each shifted right by their row index, and then creating new rows by shifting right the previous row by one, filling with zeros at the beginning.\n\nFor example:\n\nIn Example0:\n\nRow0: [6,1,0,0,0,0] \u2192 input row0 shifted 0.\n\nRow1: [3,6,1,0,0,0] \u2192 input row1 shifted 0 followed by row0 shifted 1.\n\nRow2: [0,3,6,1,0,0] \u2192 input row2 shifted 0 followed by row1 shifted 1 and row0 shifted 2.\n\nThen, rows3-5 are generated by shifting row2-4 right by one each time.\n\nBut this doesn't fit because row3 is [0,0,3,6,1,0], which would be a shift of row2.\n\nYes, it looks like each row after the first three is a shifted version of the previous row.\n\nFor Example0:\n\nRow3 is row2 shifted right by 1 \u2192 [0,0,3,6,1,0]\n\nRow4 is row3 shifted right by 1 \u2192 [0,0,0,3,6,1]\n\nRow5 is row4 shifted right by 1 \u2192 [0,0,0,0,3,6]\n\nThis pattern fits. So the first three rows are constructed from the input rows, and the next three are generated by shifting the previous rows.\n\nSimilarly, in Example1:\n\nInput rows:\n\nRow0: [0,4,0]\n\nRow1: [0,8,0]\n\nRow2: [2,0,0]\n\nOutput rows:\n\nRow0: [0,4,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow1: [0,8,4,0,0,0] \u2192 row1 input followed by row0 shifted.\n\nRow2: [2,0,8,4,0,0] \u2192 row2 input followed by row1 shifted and row0 shifted.\n\nRow3: [0,2,0,8,4,0] \u2192 shifted row2.\n\nRow4: [0,0,2,0,8,4] \u2192 shifted row3.\n\nRow5: [0,0,0,2,0,8] \u2192 shifted row4.\n\nThis also fits. So the pattern is:\n\n1. The first n rows (where n is the number of input rows) are constructed by:\n\n   a. For row i (0 \u2264 i < n):\n\n      i. Take the input row i.\n\n      ii. Append the previous output rows' elements shifted right by 1, but only the first i input rows contribute.\n\n      iii. Fill the remaining positions with zeros.\n\nWait, not sure. But in Example0:\n\nRow0 is input row0 + zeros.\n\nRow1 is input row1's first element (3), then input row0's elements (6,1,0), then zeros. So it's like input row1's first element followed by row0's elements.\n\nRow2 is input row2's first element (0), followed by input row1's first element (3), then input row0's elements (6,1,0), then zeros.\n\nThen rows3-5 are generated by shifting the previous row to the right by one.\n\nSo the process is:\n\n- For the first three rows (n=3):\n\n   Row0: input row0 + zeros.\n\n   Row1: input row1[0] followed by row0's elements shifted right by 0.\n\n   Row2: input row2[0] followed by row1's first element (input row1[0]) and row0's elements shifted.\n\nThen, each subsequent row is a right shift of the previous one.\n\nSo for the test input:\n\nInput rows:\n\nRow0: [0,0,3]\n\nRow1: [0,0,0]\n\nRow2: [0,4,9]\n\nBuilding the first three output rows:\n\nRow0: [0,0,3,0,0,0]\n\nRow1: [0 (input row1[0]), 0 (row0's first element?), 0 (row0's second?), 3 (row0's third?), 0, 0]. But according to Example1's row1, which is [0,8,4,0,0,0], it seems that row1 is constructed as input row1's first element followed by input row0's elements. So for test row1:\n\ninput row1's first element is 0, followed by input row0's elements [0,0,3], then zeros. But that would be [0,0,0,3,0,0], but the output needs to be six elements. So [0,0,0,3,0,0]?\n\nBut according to the previous examples, row1 should be [input row1[0], input row0[0], input row0[1], input row0[2], zeros]. So:\n\nTest row1: [0 (row1[0]), 0 (row0[0]), 0 (row0[1]), 3 (row0[2]), 0, 0] \u2192 [0,0,0,3,0,0].\n\nRow2: input row2[0] (0), followed by input row1[0] (0), then input row0's elements (0,0,3), but shifted. Wait, in Example0's row2: [0,3,6,1,0,0], which is input row2[0] (0), then input row1[0] (3), then input row0's elements (6,1,0). So for test row2:\n\n[0 (row2[0]), 0 (row1[0]), 0 (row0[0]), 0 (row0[1]), 3 (row0[2]), 0] \u2192 [0,0,0,0,3,0].\n\nBut row2's input row is [0,4,9]. So perhaps row2 should include all elements from row2, not just the first. Wait, in Example0's row2, row2's input is [0,0,0], but the output row2 is [0,3,6,1,0,0], which includes input row1's first element and input row0's elements. So perhaps the initial assumption is incorrect.\n\nAnother possibility is that each input row i contributes to the output rows starting at row i, and each subsequent output row shifts the elements right by one. For example:\n\nInput row0 contributes to output row0, then shifted right in row1, etc.\n\nInput row1 contributes to output row1, then shifted in row2, etc.\n\nInput row2 contributes to output row2, then shifted in row3, etc.\n\nSo for the test input:\n\nRow0: [0,0,3] \u2192 output row0: [0,0,3,0,0,0]\n\nRow1: [0,0,0] \u2192 output row1: [0,0,0,0,0,0], but shifted by 1 from row0's contribution: [0,0,0,3,0,0].\n\nRow2: [0,4,9] \u2192 output row2: [0,4,9,0,0,0], but shifted by 2 from row0's contribution: [0,0,0,3,0,0] shifted by 1 \u2192 [0,0,0,0,3,0], and shifted by 2 from row1's contribution: [0,0,0,0,0,0]. So sum is [0,4,9,0,3,0].\n\nThen row3 is row2's contribution shifted right by 1: [0,0,4,9,0,0] plus row1's shifted by 2: [0,0,0,0,0,0], and row0's shifted by3: [0,0,0,0,0,3]. Sum: [0,0,4,9,0,3].\n\nBut this is getting too complicated. Given the time constraints, perhaps I should look for a pattern in the test input based on the examples.\n\nLooking at the test input:\n\n[0,0,3]\n\n[0,0,0]\n\n[0,4,9]\n\nFollowing the pattern from the examples, the output would have the first row as the first input row followed by zeros.\n\nRow0: [0,0,3,0,0,0]\n\nRow1: [0 (from row1's first element), 0,0 (from row0's elements), 3,0,0] \u2192 [0,0,0,3,0,0]\n\nRow2: [0 (row2's first element), 4 (row2's second), 9 (row2's third), 0 (row1's elements?), 0, 0] \u2192 but according to Example0's row2, which starts with row2's first element followed by row1's first element and row0's elements.\n\nSo row2 would be [0 (row2[0]), 0 (row1[0]), 0 (row0[0]), 3 (row0[2]), 0, 0], but this doesn't fit. Alternatively, row2 would be [0,4,9,0,0,0] followed by shifts of previous rows.\n\nBut in Example2's input:\n\nInput row0: [0,0,6]\n\nRow1: [1,3,0]\n\nRow2: [0,0,0]\n\nOutput row0: [0,0,6,0,0,0]\n\nRow1: [1,3,0,6,0,0] \u2192 row1's elements followed by row0's elements shifted.\n\nRow2: [0,1,3,0,6,0] \u2192 row2's first element (0) followed by row1's elements (1,3,0) and row0's elements shifted (6).\n\nSo for the test input's row2, which is [0,4,9], the output row2 would be [0,4,9,0,0,0] followed by elements from previous rows. But according to Example2's row2, it's [0,1,3,0,6,0], which is row2's first element (0), then row1's elements (1,3,0), then row0's elements (6) shifted.\n\nSo applying this to test row2:\n\nRow2's first element is 0, then row1's elements [0,0,0], then row0's elements [0,0,3] shifted. But this would give [0,0,0,0,0,3], but the output row2 in the example is longer.\n\nAlternatively, the pattern is that each output row i (after the first) starts with the next input row's first element, followed by the previous output row's elements shifted right by one.\n\nFor example:\n\nRow0: input row0 + zeros.\n\nRow1: input row1's first element followed by row0's elements shifted right.\n\nRow2: input row2's first element followed by row1's elements shifted right.\n\nThen, rows3-5: zeros followed by previous elements shifted.\n\nApplying this to the test input:\n\nRow0: [0,0,3,0,0,0]\n\nRow1: [0 (input row1[0]), 0,0,3,0,0] \u2192 shifted row0's elements to the right by one.\n\nRow2: [0 (input row2[0]), 0,0,0,3,0] \u2192 shifted row1's elements.\n\nRow3: [0,0,0,0,0,3]\n\nRow4: [0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow5: [0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nBut this doesn't match the training examples. For instance, in Example0, row2 starts with input row2's first element (0) followed by row1's first element (3) and row0's elements (6,1). So the pattern is more complex.\n\nGiven that I'm struggling to find the exact pattern, I'll look for the test input's expected output based on the training examples' structure.\n\nIn each example, the output is constructed by:\n\n- The first row is the first input row followed by zeros.\n\n- Each subsequent row starts with the next input row's first element, followed by the previous row's elements shifted right by one, but also incorporating elements from the previous input rows.\n\nFor the test input:\n\nRow0: [0,0,3,0,0,0]\n\nRow1: starts with row1's first element (0), followed by row0's elements shifted right by one: [0,0,0,3,0,0] \u2192 [0,0,0,3,0,0]\n\nRow2: starts with row2's first element (0), followed by row1's elements shifted right by one (which are [0,0,0,3,0,0] shifted \u2192 [0,0,0,0,3,0]), but also incorporates row2's other elements (4 and 9). Wait, but input row2 is [0,4,9], so perhaps row2's output is [0,4,9,0,3,0]?\n\nBut how does this fit with the training examples?\n\nIn Example1's row2, the input row2 is [2,0,0], and the output row2 is [2,0,8,4,0,0]. Which includes row2's elements (2,0,0) followed by row1's elements (0,8,0) shifted and row0's elements (0,4,0) shifted.\n\nSo perhaps each output row i includes the input row i's elements followed by input row i-1's elements shifted right by 1, and so on.\n\nBut for the test input's row2:\n\nrow2's elements: [0,4,9]\n\nrow1's elements: [0,0,0] shifted by 1 \u2192 [0,0,0]\n\nrow0's elements: [0,0,3] shifted by 2 \u2192 [0,0,0,0,0,3]\n\nSo row2's output would be [0,4,9,0,0,3]. But this doesn't match the training examples' pattern.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and the complexity of the problem, I'll proceed to hypothesize that the pattern is as follows: Each output row i is constructed by taking the input rows in reverse order (starting from row i and going up to row 0), taking their elements, and shifting each by i - k positions (where k is the input row index), then concatenating them and padding with zeros to reach 6 elements.\n\nApplying this to the test input:\n\nFor row0 (i=0):\n\nk=0: input row0 shifted by 0 \u2192 [0,0,3,0,0,0]\n\nFor row1 (i=1):\n\nk=1: input row1 shifted by 0 \u2192 [0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nk=0: input row0 shifted by 1 \u2192 [0,0,0,3,0,0]\n\nSum: [0,0,0,3,0,0]\n\nFor row2 (i=2):\n\nk=2: input row2 shifted by 0 \u2192 [0,4,9,0,0,0]\n\nk=1: input row1 shifted by 1 \u2192 [0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nk=0: input row0 shifted by 2 \u2192 [0,0,0,0,0,3]\n\nSum: [0,4,9,0,0,3]\n\nRow3 (i=3):\n\nk=2: input row2 shifted by 1 \u2192 [0,0,4,9,0,0]\n\nk=1: input row1 shifted by 2 \u2192 [0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nk=0: input row0 shifted by 3 \u2192 [0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nSum: [0,0,4,9,0,0]\n\nRow4 (i=4):\n\nk=2: input row2 shifted by 2 \u2192 [0,0,0,4,9,0]\n\nk=1: input row1 shifted by 3 \u2192 [0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nk=0: input row0 shifted by4 \u2192 [0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nSum: [0,0,0,4,9,0]\n\nRow5 (i=5):\n\nk=2: input row2 shifted by3 \u2192 [0,0,0,0,4,9]\n\nk=1: input row1 shifted by4 \u2192 [0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nk=0: input row0 shifted by5 \u2192 [0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nSum: [0,0,0,0,4,9]\n\nBut according to this, the output would be:\n\nRow0: [0,0,3,0,0,0]\n\nRow1: [0,0,0,3,0,0]\n\nRow2: [0,4,9,0,0,3]\n\nRow3: [0,0,4,9,0,0]\n\nRow4: [0,0,0,4,9,0]\n\nRow5: [0,0,0,0,4,9]\n\nHowever, this does not match the structure of the training examples. For instance, in the training examples, each row after the first few continues to shift the elements further, but in this case, row3 has [0,0,4,9,0,0], which doesn't follow the expected pattern.\n\nGiven that I'm not able to confidently determine the pattern, but based on the examples, I'll assume that the output matrix is formed by creating a Toeplitz matrix from the input columns, with each column being the input column followed by zeros. Then, each subsequent column is a shifted version of the previous.\n\nFor the test input:\n\nInput columns are:\n\nCol0: [0,0,0]\n\nCol1: [0,0,4]\n\nCol2: [3,0,9]\n\nFollowing the Toeplitz pattern, the output would have columns:\n\nCol0: [0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nCol1: [0,0,0,4,0,0]\n\nCol2: [3,0,9,0,0,0]\n\nBut this doesn't match the training examples.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and the lack of progress, I'll make an educated guess based on the examples. Each output row is constructed by taking the input rows in a certain order, shifting them right by the row index, and concatenating. For the test input, the output would be:\n\nRow0: [0,0,3,0,0,0]\n\nRow1: [0,0,0,3,0,0]\n\nRow2: [0,4,9,0,3,0]\n\nRow3: [0,0,4,9,0,3]\n\nRow4: [0,0,0,4,9,0]\n\nRow5: [0,0,0,0,4,9]\n\nBut comparing with Example2's output, which has input row2 as [0,0,6], and the output row2 as [0,1,3,0,6,0], I think this approach is incorrect. However, given the time constraints, I'll proceed with this answer and hope it's correct.",

        "cot_2": "Okay, let's tackle this puzzle. Hmm, so the task is to figure out the pattern from the training examples and apply it to the test input. Let me look at the examples one by one.\n\nStarting with Example 0. The input is a 3x3 matrix:\n\n[6, 1, 0]\n[3, 0, 0]\n[0, 0, 0]\n\nAnd the output is a 6x6 matrix. Let me see how each row of the output is formed. The first row of the output is [6,1,0,0,0,0], which seems like the first input row followed by three zeros. Then the second row of the output is [3,6,1,0,0,0]. Wait, the first element here is 3, which is the start of the second input row. Then followed by 6 and 1 from the first input row. Then zeros. The third output row is [0,3,6,1,0,0]. Here, the first element is 0, then 3 from the second input row, followed by 6,1 from the first. Then more zeros. \n\nThis pattern seems like each subsequent row is shifting the elements from the input rows to the right, and adding a new element from the next row. Let me check if that's consistent.\n\nIn Example 0, the input rows are:\n\nRow 0: [6,1,0]\nRow 1: [3,0,0]\nRow 2: [0,0,0]\n\nLooking at the output rows:\n\nRow 0: [6,1,0,0,0,0] \u2192 input row 0 followed by zeros.\nRow 1: [3,6,1,0,0,0] \u2192 starts with 3 (row1[0]), then row0's elements (6,1), then zeros.\nRow 2: [0,3,6,1,0,0] \u2192 starts with 0 (row2[0] is 0?), then row1[0] (3), then row0's elements (6,1), etc.\nWait, maybe there's a vertical stacking with each row shifting down and combining elements from the previous rows.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output matrix is constructed by creating a Toeplitz matrix where each row is a shifted version of the previous, using elements from the input rows. Let me think.\n\nAnother approach: the output matrix's rows might be built by combining elements from the input matrix in a diagonal fashion. Let's check the positions.\n\nIn Example 0's output:\n\nRow 0: [6,1,0,0,0,0] \u2192 input row0.\nRow1: [3,6,1,0,0,0] \u2192 first element is row1[0], then row0[0], row0[1], then zeros.\nRow2: [0,3,6,1,0,0] \u2192 first element is row2[0] (0), then row1[0], row0[0], row0[1], etc.\nRow3: [0,0,3,6,1,0] \u2192 starts with 0 (maybe from row2[1]?), then row1[1] (0?), then row0[0], etc. Hmm, that doesn't fit. Wait, row3 is [0,0,3,6,1,0]. The third element is 3, which is row1[0]. Then 6 (row0[0]), 1 (row0[1]). So maybe each row is shifting the previous elements down and to the right, but taking elements from the input rows in a certain order.\n\nLooking at Example1's input:\n\n[0,4,0]\n[0,8,0]\n[2,0,0]\n\nOutput:\n\n[0,4,0,0,0,0]\n[0,8,4,0,0,0]\n[2,0,8,4,0,0]\n[0,2,0,8,4,0]\n[0,0,2,0,8,4]\n[0,0,0,2,0,8]\n\nHere, the first output row is the input row0. The second output row starts with 0 (row1[0]), then 8 (row1[1]), then 4 (row0[1]), then zeros. Wait, maybe not. Let's see:\n\nRow1 of output: [0,8,4,0,0,0]. The elements here are 0 (row1[0]), 8 (row1[1]), 4 (row0[1]), then zeros. Hmm. Then row2: [2,0,8,4,0,0]. 2 (row2[0]), 0 (row2[1]?), 8 (row1[1]), 4 (row0[1]). Not sure. Maybe there's a pattern where each new row starts with the next element from the input matrix's columns, but shifted.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is generated by taking each column of the input matrix and creating a diagonal matrix for each, then combining them. Let's see.\n\nIn Example0, the input has three columns:\n\nCol0: 6,3,0\nCol1:1,0,0\nCol2:0,0,0\n\nLooking at the output matrix, each column in the output might be built from these. For example, the first column in the output is [6,3,0,0,0,0]. The second column is [1,6,3,0,0,0], third is [0,1,6,3,0,0], and so on. Wait, no. Because the first row is [6,1,0,0,0,0], which is the first input row followed by zeros. The second row is [3,6,1,0,0,0], which starts with 3 (from row1 of input), then 6 and 1 from row0. Then the third row is [0,3,6,1,0,0], starting with 0 (row2's first element), then 3 (row1's first), then 6,1 from row0. So each subsequent row is shifting the previous elements down and to the right, but pulling elements from the input rows.\n\nSo perhaps each row in the output is a combination of the input's rows, shifted. Let's see for the first example:\n\nIn Example0, the output has 6 rows. The input has 3 rows. So maybe each output row corresponds to a shifted version of the input rows stacked vertically.\n\nAnother approach: the output matrix is a convolution or a Toeplitz matrix where each row is a shifted version of the input rows. Let's check the dimensions. The input is 3x3, output is 6x6. So maybe each row in the output is built by taking elements from the input's rows in a way that shifts them diagonally.\n\nAlternatively, the output is constructed by creating a matrix where each element (i,j) is determined by the sum of certain elements from the input. But looking at the numbers, it seems more like a structural transformation rather than a mathematical operation.\n\nLooking at Example0's output:\n\nRow0: input row0 + 3 zeros.\n\nRow1: starts with input row1[0] (3), followed by input row0[0] (6), row0[1] (1), then zeros.\n\nRow2: starts with input row2[0] (0), followed by row1[0] (3), row0[0] (6), row0[1] (1), zeros.\n\nRow3: starts with 0 (maybe row2[1] which is 0?), then row1[1] (0), row0[0] (6), row0[1] (1). Wait, but row3 in the output is [0,0,3,6,1,0]. Hmm, that third element is 3, which is row1[0]. So perhaps row3 starts with two zeros, then 3 (row1[0]), 6 (row0[0]), 1 (row0[1]), 0.\n\nThis seems inconsistent. Let's see another example.\n\nTake Example1's input:\n\nRow0: [0,4,0]\n\nRow1: [0,8,0]\n\nRow2: [2,0,0]\n\nThe output rows:\n\nRow0: [0,4,0,0,0,0] \u2192 row0 plus zeros.\n\nRow1: [0,8,4,0,0,0] \u2192 starts with row1[0] (0), then row1[1] (8), row0[1] (4), then zeros.\n\nRow2: [2,0,8,4,0,0] \u2192 starts with row2[0] (2), then row2[1] (0), row1[1] (8), row0[1] (4), zeros.\n\nRow3: [0,2,0,8,4,0] \u2192 starts with 0 (maybe row2[2] is 0?), then row2[0] (2), row2[1] (0), row1[1] (8), row0[1] (4).\n\nWait, that's not matching. Let's look at row3 of output in Example1: [0,2,0,8,4,0]. The elements are 0,2,0,8,4,0. How does this relate to the input? Let's see:\n\nPerhaps each row in the output is built by taking elements from the input in a diagonal way. For instance, each row shifts the elements from the previous rows to the right and introduces elements from the next input row.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's a convolution where each output row is a shifted combination of the input rows. For example, the first output row is input row0. The second output row starts with input row1[0], then input row0[0], row0[1], etc. Then the third row starts with input row2[0], then row1[0], row0[0], row0[1], and so on. Then after that, the next rows would start with zeros, then previous elements shifted.\n\nWait, looking at Example0's output rows:\n\nRow0: [6,1,0,0,0,0] \u2192 row0\nRow1: [3,6,1,0,0,0] \u2192 row1[0], row0[0], row0[1], row0[2] (which is 0)\nRow2: [0,3,6,1,0,0] \u2192 row2[0], row1[0], row0[0], row0[1]\nRow3: [0,0,3,6,1,0] \u2192 zeros, then row1[0], row0[0], row0[1]\nWait, no. Row3 in example0's output is [0,0,3,6,1,0]. So the third element is 3 (row1[0]), then 6 (row0[0]), 1 (row0[1]). The first two elements are zeros. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each row is formed by taking elements from the input columns in a shifted manner. For example, the columns of the input are [6,3,0], [1,0,0], [0,0,0]. The output columns seem to be shifted versions. Let's see:\n\nIn Example0's output, the first column is [6,3,0,0,0,0]. That's the first input column followed by zeros. The second column is [1,6,3,0,0,0]. Which is the second input column's first element (1) followed by the first column's elements (6,3,0) but shifted down. Wait, no. Because the second column starts with 1 (from input's row0, column1), then 6 (row0 column0), 3 (row1 column0), 0 (row2 column0), but that's not exactly matching.\n\nAlternatively, each column in the output is built by taking the input columns and shifting them down by their index. For example:\n\n- The first column of the output is input column0, then zeros.\n- The second column is shifted down by one, so starts with 0, then input column1, etc.\nBut in Example0, input column1 is [1,0,0], so the second output column would be [1,0,0,0,0,0], but in the output, the second column is [1,6,3,0,0,0], which doesn't fit.\n\nHmm, this is tricky. Let's think differently. The output matrix in all examples is 6x6. The input is 3x3. So perhaps each input row is being used to generate parts of the output matrix in a way that each subsequent row shifts the elements from the input rows to the right.\n\nLooking at Example0 again:\n\nInput rows:\n\nRow0: [6,1,0]\nRow1: [3,0,0]\nRow2: [0,0,0]\n\nThe output has 6 rows, each longer than the input. Let's see:\n\nRow0 of output is [6,1,0,0,0,0] \u2192 same as input row0 followed by three zeros.\n\nRow1 of output starts with 3 (from row1[0]), then 6,1 (from row0's first two elements), then zeros.\n\nRow2 starts with 0 (from row2[0]), then 3 (row1[0]), 6,1 (row0's elements again), then zeros.\n\nRow3: [0,0,3,6,1,0] \u2192 two zeros, then 3,6,1.\n\nRow4: [0,0,0,3,6,1] \u2192 three zeros, then 3,6,1.\n\nRow5: [0,0,0,0,3,6] \u2192 four zeros, then 3,6.\n\nWait, but row5 ends with 6. Where does that 6 come from? Oh, maybe from row0[0], but shifted even more. Alternatively, perhaps each row after the third is a shift of the previous row, moving the non-zero elements to the right.\n\nAlternatively, the output is created by taking each element from the input matrix and placing them along diagonals. For example:\n\nIn Example0:\n\n6 is placed at (0,0)\n1 at (0,1)\n0 at (0,2)\n3 at (1,0)\n0 at (1,1)\n0 at (1,2)\n0 at (2,0)\n0 at (2,1)\n0 at (2,2)\n\nBut how does this expand to 6x6? Maybe each element is spread along a diagonal. For example, the first element (row0, col0) is 6, and it's placed at (0,0), (1,1), (2,2), etc., but the output rows don't seem to follow that.\n\nAnother angle: The output matrix's rows are constructed by taking the input rows and shifting them progressively to the right, then stacking. For example, input rows are 3 elements each. The output rows are 6 elements. So for each input row, create a new row where the elements are shifted right by (row index) positions. Then sum all the contributions.\n\nBut in Example0, the first output row is input row0 plus three zeros. The second output row has the input row1 shifted by 0, and input row0 shifted by 1? Let's see:\n\nRow0: row0 + zeros.\nRow1: row1 shifted by 0 (starting at column0) and row0 shifted by 1 (starting at column1). So row1[0] is 3 at column0, then row0[0] (6) at column1, row0[1] (1) at column2, row0[2] (0) at column3, then zeros. But in the output row1, it's [3,6,1,0,0,0]. So this matches. Then row2 would be row2 shifted by 0 (0 at column0), row1 shifted by 1 (3 at column1), row0 shifted by 2 (6 at column2, 1 at column3). Which gives [0,3,6,1,0,0], matching the output. Then row3 would be row2 shifted by 1 (0 at column1?), no. Alternatively, row3 is row1 shifted by 2 and row0 shifted by 3. But in row3 of example0's output, it's [0,0,3,6,1,0]. So 3 is at column2, which would be row1[0] shifted by 2. 6 is at column3, row0[0] shifted by 3. Then 1 shifted by 4. So yes, each row after the first three might be shifting the input rows further right. And after row3, row4 would shift row1 by 3, row0 by4, etc. But row4 in example0 is [0,0,0,3,6,1], which is row1[0] (3) shifted by 3, row0[0] (6) shifted by4, row0[1] (1) shifted by5. That makes sense. Then row5 would be [0,0,0,0,3,6], which is row1[0] shifted by4 (to column4) and row0[0] shifted by5 (column5).\n\nSo the pattern seems to be:\n\nFor each row in the output, the elements are formed by taking the input rows shifted progressively. The first row (row0) is input row0 followed by zeros. The next rows (row1 to row5) are constructed by taking input rows 1 and 2, each shifted further right, and overlapping where necessary.\n\nWait, but input has three rows. How are they being used? Let's outline:\n\nFor each output row i (0 to 5):\n\n- The elements are formed by combining the input rows shifted by (i - input_row_index) positions. For example:\n\nIn row0 (i=0):\n\n- Only input row0 is considered, shifted by 0, resulting in [6,1,0,0,0,0].\n\nIn row1 (i=1):\n\n- input row1 shifted by 0: [3,0,0,0,0,0] but starts at column0 \u2192 3 at 0, then 0,0,...\n- input row0 shifted by 1: [6,1,0] shifted right by 1 \u2192 [0,6,1,0,0,0]\n- Adding them (element-wise) would give [3,6,1,0,0,0], which matches row1.\n\nIn row2 (i=2):\n\n- input row2 shifted by 0: [0,0,0,0,0,0] (since row2 is [0,0,0])\n- input row1 shifted by 1: [3,0,0] shifted right by1 \u2192 [0,3,0,0,0,0]\n- input row0 shifted by2: [0,0,6,1,0,0]\n- Summing: 0 + 0 \u2192 row2 starts with 0,3+0=3, 0+6=6, 0+1=1 \u2192 [0,3,6,1,0,0], which matches.\n\nRow3 (i=3):\n\n- input row2 shifted by 1: [0,0,0] shifted by1 \u2192 [0,0,0,0,0,0]\n- input row1 shifted by2: [3,0,0] shifted by2 \u2192 [0,0,3,0,0,0]\n- input row0 shifted by3: [0,0,0,6,1,0]\n- Summing gives [0,0,3,6,1,0], which matches row3.\n\nRow4 (i=4):\n\n- input row2 shifted by2: zeros\n- input row1 shifted by3: [0,0,0,3,0,0]\n- input row0 shifted by4: [0,0,0,0,6,1]\n- Summing: [0,0,0,3,6,1], which matches row4.\n\nRow5 (i=5):\n\n- input row2 shifted by3: zeros\n- input row1 shifted by4: [0,0,0,0,3,0]\n- input row0 shifted by5: [0,0,0,0,0,6]\n- Summing gives [0,0,0,0,3,6], which matches row5.\n\nSo the pattern is that for each output row i, it's the sum of all input rows j shifted right by (i - j) positions. Since the input has three rows (j=0,1,2), each input row contributes to the output row by being shifted right by (i - j) positions. If the shift is negative, that row doesn't contribute (since shifting left would go out of bounds). Otherwise, shift right and pad with zeros.\n\nTesting this with Example1:\n\nInput rows:\n\nRow0: [0,4,0]\n\nRow1: [0,8,0]\n\nRow2: [2,0,0]\n\nOutput rows:\n\nRow0: row0 shifted by (0-0)=0 \u2192 [0,4,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow1: row1 shifted by (1-0)=1 \u2192 [0,0,8,0,0,0], but no, the output row1 is [0,8,4,0,0,0]. Wait, maybe my previous hypothesis is incorrect. Let's re-examine.\n\nWait, in Example1's output row1 is [0,8,4,0,0,0]. According to the previous hypothesis, row1 would be sum of row1 shifted by (1-0)=1 and row0 shifted by (1-0)=1? Wait, no. The previous logic said that for output row i, each input row j is shifted by (i-j). So for row1 (i=1):\n\n- j=0: shift by 1-0=1 \u2192 [0,0,4,0,0,0]\n\n- j=1: shift by 1-1=0 \u2192 [0,8,0,0,0,0]\n\n- j=2: shift by 1-2=-1 \u2192 no contribution.\n\nSumming these would give [0,8,4,0,0,0], which matches row1's output. \n\nYes! So this seems to fit. Let's check row2 (i=2):\n\n- j=0: shift by 2 \u2192 [0,0,0,4,0,0]\n\n- j=1: shift by1 \u2192 [0,0,8,0,0,0]\n\n- j=2: shift by0 \u2192 [2,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nSum: 2 at position0, 0+0=0, 0+8=8, 4+0=4 \u2192 [2,0,8,4,0,0], which matches row2.\n\nRow3 (i=3):\n\n- j=0: shift by3 \u2192 [0,0,0,0,4,0]\n\n- j=1: shift by2 \u2192 [0,0,0,8,0,0]\n\n- j=2: shift by1 \u2192 [0,2,0,0,0,0]\n\nSum: 0 (from j=2 shifted by1) \u2192 0 at position1, 2 at position0? Wait, no. Let me re-calculate.\n\nWait, for row3 (i=3):\n\nEach input row j:\n\nj=0: row0 is [0,4,0]. Shift by 3: [0,0,0,0,4,0].\n\nj=1: row1 [0,8,0] shifted by (3-1)=2 \u2192 [0,0,0,8,0,0].\n\nj=2: row2 [2,0,0] shifted by (3-2)=1 \u2192 [0,2,0,0,0,0].\n\nSumming these:\n\nposition0: 0 (from j=2's shift) \u2192 0.\n\nposition1: 2 (from j=2 shifted by1).\n\nposition3: 8 (from j=1 shifted by2).\n\nposition4:4 (from j=0 shifted by3).\n\nWait, but the actual row3 in Example1's output is [0,2,0,8,4,0]. Summing:\n\n0 (from j=2's shift at position0) \u2192 0 at position0.\n\nj=2's shift gives [0,2,0,0,0,0] \u2192 position1 is 2.\n\nj=1's shift gives [0,0,0,8,0,0] \u2192 position3 is8.\n\nj=0's shift gives [0,0,0,0,4,0] \u2192 position4 is4.\n\nSo combining these, the sum would be:\n\n[0 (pos0), 2 (pos1), 0 (from j=2's pos2), 8 (pos3),4 (pos4),0]. That matches the output row3: [0,2,0,8,4,0]. \n\nYes, this pattern works. So the rule is: each output row i is the sum of the input rows j (for j=0,1,2) each shifted right by (i-j) positions. If (i-j) is negative, the input row j does not contribute to this output row. Then, each shifted row is added together.\n\nTherefore, for each output row i (from 0 to 5, since output is 6x6), we take each input row j (0,1,2), shift it right by (i-j) positions (if i >= j; else no shift, so it doesn't contribute), and sum all the shifted rows to form the output row.\n\nNow, applying this to the test input:\n\nTest Input:\n\n[0, 0, 3]\n\n[0, 0, 0]\n\n[0, 4, 9]\n\nSo input rows are:\n\nRow0: [0,0,3]\n\nRow1: [0,0,0]\n\nRow2: [0,4,9]\n\nWe need to generate the output rows 0 to 5.\n\nLet's compute each row:\n\nFor each i in 0-5:\n\nRow i is sum of input rows j shifted by (i-j) positions, where j ranges 0-2.\n\nLet's compute each i:\n\ni=0:\n\nj can be 0 (since i-j=0-0=0 >=0).\n\nShift row0 by 0: [0,0,3,0,0,0].\n\nj=1: i-j= -1 \u2192 no contribution.\n\nj=2: i-j= -2 \u2192 no contribution.\n\nSum: [0,0,3,0,0,0].\n\nBut wait, the output rows have length 6, so the input row j is shifted right by (i-j) positions, which means adding (i-j) zeros at the beginning, and truncating to 6 elements. Wait, no. For example, when shifting right by k positions, the original elements are moved k positions to the right, filled with zeros on the left. So row j shifted by k positions would be [0]*k + rowj, and then truncated to 6 elements.\n\nFor example, rowj is of length 3. So shifting it right by k positions would result in a list of length 3 +k, but since the output is 6 elements, it's padded with zeros to the right if needed.\n\nWait, let's clarify:\n\nIf input rowj has elements [a,b,c], shifting it right by k positions would create a list starting with k zeros, followed by a,b,c, then zeros to make the total length 6. Wait, no. Let's take example0:\n\nRow0: [6,1,0]. Shifted by 0: [6,1,0,0,0,0].\n\nShifted by1: [0,6,1,0,0,0].\n\nShifted by2: [0,0,6,1,0,0].\n\nEtc. So when you shift a rowj by k positions, you add k zeros at the beginning, then append the original elements, and then pad with zeros to make the total length 6.\n\nSo, for rowj shifted by k, the resulting array is:\n\n[0]*k + rowj + [0]*(6 - (k + len(rowj))).\n\nBut since len(rowj) is 3, and 6 - (k +3) can't be negative for k up to 3. For example, if k=4, then 0*4 + rowj (3 elements) \u2192 total 7 elements, but we need to truncate to 6. Wait, no. Let me think again.\n\nIf you shift a 3-element row by k positions to the right, the new row will have the elements starting at position k. So for example:\n\nOriginal rowj: [a,b,c]\n\nShifted by k=0 \u2192 positions 0,1,2: [a,b,c,0,0,0]\n\nShifted by k=1 \u2192 positions 1,2,3: [0,a,b,c,0,0], but wait, no. Because shifting right by 1 would insert one zero at the start, then the elements. So for a 3-element row shifted by k, the new elements are:\n\npositions 0..5:\n\nfor i in 0..5:\n\nif i >=k and i <k+3: element is rowj[i -k]\n\nelse: 0.\n\nSo for example, rowj shifted by k=2:\n\npositions 0:0, 1:0, 2:a, 3:b, 4:c, 5:0.\n\nSo the shifted row is [0,0,a,b,c,0].\n\nNow, for the test input:\n\nLet's compute each output row:\n\nTest Input rows:\n\nRow0: [0,0,3]\n\nRow1: [0,0,0]\n\nRow2: [0,4,9]\n\nLet's compute each output row i from 0 to5.\n\ni=0:\n\nj=0: shift by 0 \u2192 [0,0,3,0,0,0]\n\nj=1: i-j= -1 \u2192 no contribution.\n\nj=2: i-j= -2 \u2192 no contribution.\n\nSum: [0,0,3,0,0,0].\n\nBut looking at the training examples, the first row of the output is the first input row followed by zeros, which matches.\n\ni=0 \u2192 output row0: [0,0,3,0,0,0].\n\ni=1:\n\nj=0: shift by 1 \u2192 [0,0,0,3,0,0]\n\nj=1: shift by 0 \u2192 [0,0,0,0,0,0] (since row1 is [0,0,0])\n\nj=2: i-j=1-2= -1 \u2192 no contribution.\n\nSum: [0,0,0,3,0,0]. Wait, but in the training example1, when i=1, the output row1 includes elements from row1. Hmm, but in this test case, row1 is all zeros. So the output row1 would be sum of row0 shifted by1 and row1 shifted by0. But row1 is zeros. So the sum is [0,0,0,3,0,0]. But wait, according to the previous example, maybe that's not correct. Let's check Example1's row1. There, row1 of input is [0,8,0]. When shifted by0, it becomes [0,8,0,0,0,0], and row0 shifted by1 gives [0,0,4,0,0,0]. Summing gives [0,8,4,0,0,0]. So in the test case, j=0 shifted by1 gives [0,0,0,3,0,0], j=1 shifted by0 gives [0,0,0,0,0,0]. Sum is [0,0,0,3,0,0]. But according to the training examples, maybe this is correct. However, looking at the training examples, perhaps there's something missing. For example, in Example2:\n\nInput:\n\nRow0: [0,0,6]\n\nRow1: [1,3,0]\n\nRow2: [0,0,0]\n\nOutput row1 is [1,3,0,6,0,0]. Let's see:\n\nFor i=1:\n\nj=0: shifted by1 \u2192 [0,0,0,6,0,0]\n\nj=1: shifted by0 \u2192 [1,3,0,0,0,0]\n\nj=2: shifted by-1 \u2192 no contribution.\n\nSum: [1,3,0,6,0,0], which matches. So the same logic applies.\n\nBack to the test case. For i=1:\n\nsum is j=0 shifted by1 (0\u2192 [0,0,0,3,0,0]) and j=1 shifted by0 (all zeros). So sum is [0,0,0,3,0,0]. But looking at the training examples, when j=1 is non-zero, it contributes. Here, j=1 is zero, so sum is just row0 shifted by1. But according to the pattern, this is correct.\n\nProceeding.\n\ni=2:\n\nj=0: shift by2 \u2192 [0,0,0,0,3,0]\n\nj=1: shift by1 \u2192 [0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nj=2: shift by0 \u2192 [0,4,9,0,0,0]\n\nSum:\n\npos0:0 (j=2, shifted by0 \u2192 0)\n\npos1:4 (j=2 shifted by0 \u2192 pos1 is4)\n\npos2:9 (j=2 shifted by0 \u2192 pos2 is9)\n\npos3:0 (j=0 shifted by2 \u2192 pos3 is3, but j=2's contribution here is0?)\n\nWait, no. Let's break down each shifted row:\n\nj=0 shifted by2 \u2192 [0,0,0,0,3,0]. So elements are 0 at positions0-3: [0,0,0,0,3,0].\n\nj=1 shifted by1 \u2192 [0,0,0,0,0,0].\n\nj=2 shifted by0 \u2192 [0,4,9,0,0,0].\n\nSumming these:\n\nposition0: 0 (j=0) + 0 (j=1) + 0 (j=2) \u2192 0.\n\nposition1:0 +0 +4 \u21924.\n\nposition2:0 +0 +9 \u21929.\n\nposition3:0 +0 +0 \u21920.\n\nposition4:3 +0 +0 \u21923.\n\nposition5:0 +0 +0 \u21920.\n\nSo sum is [0,4,9,0,3,0].\n\nWait, but according to the pattern, when j=2's shifted by0, its elements are at positions0-2: [0,4,9]. Wait, no. Wait, j=2 is [0,4,9]. Shifting by0 (no shift) \u2192 the elements start at position0. So [0,4,9,0,0,0]. So positions0:0,1:4,2:9, and the rest zeros. So adding j=0 shifted by2's contribution ([0,0,0,0,3,0]):\n\npos0:0+0=0.\n\npos1:0+4=4.\n\npos2:0+9=9.\n\npos3:0+0=0.\n\npos4:3+0=3.\n\npos5:0+0=0.\n\nSo the sum is [0,4,9,0,3,0].\n\nBut wait, in Example2's row2 (i=2), the output is [0,1,3,0,6,0], which comes from summing j=0 shifted by2 (0s and 6 at pos2), j=1 shifted by1 (1 at pos1,3 at pos2), and j=2 shifted by0 (0). So the logic holds.\n\nSo for test case i=2, the output row is [0,4,9,0,3,0].\n\nProceeding.\n\ni=3:\n\nj can be 0,1,2.\n\nj=0: shift by3 \u2192 [0,0,0,0,0,3] (wait, row0 is [0,0,3]. Shifted by3 \u2192 [0,0,0,0,0,3]. Because positions3,4,5 would be 0,0,3, but shifted by3, positions0-2 are 0, then the elements start at position3: 0,0,3. Wait, no. When you shift by3 positions to the right, the original elements start at position3. So row0 is [0,0,3]. Shifted by3: [0,0,0,0,0,3]?\n\nWait, let me think: shifting byk positions. For each element in the original rowj, it is placed at position k + index. So for rowj elements [a, b, c], shifted by k:\n\npositions k \u2192 a, k+1 \u2192 b, k+2 \u2192c. The rest are zeros.\n\nSo for j=0, row0 is [0,0,3]. Shifted by3 \u2192 positions3,4,5: 0,0,3. So the shifted row is [0,0,0,0,0,3].\n\nj=1: shift by3-1=2 \u2192 row1 shifted by2 \u2192 [0,0,0,0,0,0] (since row1 is [0,0,0]).\n\nj=2: shift by3-2=1 \u2192 row2 shifted by1 \u2192 [0,0,4,9,0,0].\n\nSo sum:\n\nj=0's contribution: [0,0,0,0,0,3]\n\nj=1's contribution: [0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nj=2's contribution: [0,0,4,9,0,0]\n\nSumming element-wise:\n\npos0:0+0+0=0\n\npos1:0+0+0=0\n\npos2:0+0+4=4\n\npos3:0+0+9=9\n\npos4:0+0+0=0\n\npos5:3+0+0=3\n\nSo the sum is [0,0,4,9,0,3].\n\nBut wait, that's not matching the expected pattern. Let me double-check.\n\nWait, j=2's row is [0,4,9]. Shifted by1 \u2192 starts at position1: [0,0,4,9,0,0]. Because:\n\nposition0:0 (from shift)\n\nposition1:0 (original rowj[0] is 0)\n\nposition2:4 (original rowj[1])\n\nposition3:9 (original rowj[2])\n\npositions4-5:0.\n\nSo yes, shifted by1: [0,0,4,9,0,0].\n\nSo summing with j=0's shifted by3 (pos5=3):\n\nSo the sum for i=3 is [0,0,4,9,0,3].\n\nBut looking at training examples, each output row seems to have the elements from the input rows cascading to the right. Let's see what this would look like.\n\nBut let's proceed.\n\ni=3 output row: [0,0,4,9,0,3].\n\ni=4:\n\nj=0: shift by4 \u2192 [0,0,0,0,0,0] (since row0's elements would start at position4: 0,0,3. So the shifted row is [0,0,0,0,0,0] (since 4+2=6, which is beyond the 6 elements).\n\nWait, row0 is [0,0,3]. Shifting by4:\n\npositions4:0, 5:0. The third element (3) would be at position4+2=6, which is beyond the array. So the shifted row is [0,0,0,0,0,0].\n\nj=1: shift by4-1=3 \u2192 row1 shifted by3 \u2192 [0,0,0,0,0,0].\n\nj=2: shift by4-2=2 \u2192 row2 shifted by2 \u2192 [0,0,0,4,9,0].\n\nSum:\n\nj=0: [0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nj=1: [0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nj=2: [0,0,0,4,9,0]\n\nSum: [0,0,0,4,9,0].\n\ni=4 output row: [0,0,0,4,9,0].\n\ni=5:\n\nj=0: shift by5 \u2192 [0,0,0,0,0,0].\n\nj=1: shift by5-1=4 \u2192 [0,0,0,0,0,0].\n\nj=2: shift by5-2=3 \u2192 row2 shifted by3: [0,0,0,0,4,9].\n\nSum: [0,0,0,0,4,9].\n\nPutting it all together, the output matrix would be:\n\nRow0: [0,0,3,0,0,0]\n\nRow1: [0,0,0,3,0,0]\n\nRow2: [0,4,9,0,3,0]\n\nRow3: [0,0,4,9,0,3]\n\nRow4: [0,0,0,4,9,0]\n\nRow5: [0,0,0,0,4,9]\n\nBut wait, let's compare this with the training examples. For instance, Example0's row3 is [0,0,3,6,1,0], which includes elements from row1 and row0 shifted. In our test case's row3, we have 4 and9 from row2 shifted by1, and 3 from row0 shifted by3. But this seems correct according to the pattern.\n\nHowever, looking at Example1's output, the rows after the initial ones start to include elements from the third input row (row2) shifted. For instance, in Example1's row2, we have 2 from row2[0], then 0,8,4. So the pattern holds.\n\nBut wait, the test case's output row0 is [0,0,3,0,0,0], row1 [0,0,0,3,0,0], row2 [0,4,9,0,3,0], row3 [0,0,4,9,0,3], row4 [0,0,0,4,9,0], row5 [0,0,0,0,4,9].\n\nBut looking at the training examples, for example Example0's output rows after row3 start to shift the elements further. For example, row4 in Example0 is [0,0,0,3,6,1], which is row1's 3 shifted by3, row0's 6 and1 shifted by4. Similarly, in the test case's row3, we have 4 and9 from row2 shifted by1, and 3 from row0 shifted by3. \n\nBut let's check if there's a mistake in the calculation.\n\nIn row3 of test case:\n\nj=0 shifted by3: [0,0,0,0,0,3]\n\nj=2 shifted by1: [0,0,4,9,0,0]\n\nSumming these gives:\n\npos0:0\n\npos1:0\n\npos2:4\n\npos3:9\n\npos4:0\n\npos5:3\n\nSo row3 is [0,0,4,9,0,3].\n\nBut according to the pattern, this is correct.\n\nNow, comparing with the training examples, perhaps there's a mistake in this approach. For example, in Example2:\n\nInput rows:\n\nRow0: [0,0,6]\n\nRow1: [1,3,0]\n\nRow2: [0,0,0]\n\nOutput row3: [0,0,1,3,0,6]\n\nWhich is j=0 shifted by3 (6 at pos5), j=1 shifted by2 (1 at pos2,3 at pos3), j=2 shifted by1 (0). Summing gives [0,0,1,3,0,6], which matches.\n\nSo according to the pattern, the test case's output is as calculated.\n\nBut let me check another angle. In the test input, row2 is [0,4,9]. So when this row is shifted by k positions, its elements start at position k. For example, shifted by0: [0,4,9,0,0,0], by1: [0,0,4,9,0,0], by2: [0,0,0,4,9,0], by3: [0,0,0,0,4,9], by4: [0,0,0,0,0,4], by5: [0,0,0,0,0,0].\n\nSo for i=2 (output row2):\n\nj=2's contribution is shifted by0: [0,4,9,0,0,0].\n\nj=0's contribution is shifted by2: [0,0,0,0,3,0].\n\nj=1's contribution is shifted by1: zeros.\n\nSum is [0,4,9,0,3,0].\n\nYes.\n\nBut looking at the training examples, like Example1's row3 is [0,2,0,8,4,0], which comes from row2 shifted by1 (2 at pos0+1=1), row1 shifted by2 (8 at pos3), and row0 shifted by3 (4 at pos4). So the elements are in different positions based on their shifts.\n\nBut according to the pattern, the test case's output should be as calculated. However, when I look at the training examples, there's a different behavior. For example, in Example0's row4, it's [0,0,0,3,6,1], which comes from row1 shifted by3 (3 at pos3) and row0 shifted by4 (6 at pos4, 1 at pos5). Similarly, in the test case's row4, it's [0,0,0,4,9,0], which comes from row2 shifted by2 (4 at pos3,9 at pos4).\n\nBut the last element in row4 of the test case is 0, while in Example0's row4, it's 1.\n\nSo according to this pattern, the output for the test input would be:\n\n[0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0]\n\n[0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0]\n\n[0, 4, 9, 0, 3, 0]\n\n[0, 0, 4, 9, 0, 3]\n\n[0, 0, 0, 4, 9, 0]\n\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 9]\n\nBut wait, let's compare this with the training examples. For instance, in Example1's output:\n\nRow3: [0,2,0,8,4,0]\n\nRow4: [0,0,2,0,8,4]\n\nRow5: [0,0,0,2,0,8]\n\nHere, each row after row2 includes elements from row2 (input row2) shifted appropriately. Similarly, in the test case's output, row5 has [0,0,0,0,4,9], which is row2 shifted by3: [0,0,0,0,4,9].\n\nThis seems consistent.\n\nBut when I look at the test case's output rows:\n\nRow0: [0,0,3,0,0,0]\n\nRow1: [0,0,0,3,0,0]\n\nRow2: [0,4,9,0,3,0]\n\nRow3: [0,0,4,9,0,3]\n\nRow4: [0,0,0,4,9,0]\n\nRow5: [0,0,0,0,4,9]\n\nThis seems to fit the pattern. However, in the training examples, each output row has elements that are a combination of multiple input rows. For instance, in Example0's row1, it's [3,6,1,0,0,0], which combines row1 and row0. In the test case's row2, it's [0,4,9,0,3,0], combining row2 and row0 (the 3 at position4 comes from row0 shifted by2).\n\nBut the test case's row0 and row1 only have elements from row0 and row1 (but row1 is all zeros). So this seems correct.\n\nTherefore, the final answer should be the matrix constructed as follows:\n\nRow0: [0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0]\n\nRow1: [0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0]\n\nRow2: [0, 4, 9, 0, 3, 0]\n\nRow3: [0, 0, 4, 9, 0, 3]\n\nRow4: [0, 0, 0, 4, 9, 0]\n\nRow5: [0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 9]"
