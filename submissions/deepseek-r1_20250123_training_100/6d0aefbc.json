        "cot_1": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. So, looking at the training examples, each input is a 3x3 grid of numbers, and the output is a 3x6 grid. The output seems to have each row doubled in length. Let's see how they're transformed.\n\nStarting with Example 0:\n\nInput rows:\n[6,6,6]\n[1,6,1]\n[8,8,6]\n\nOutput rows:\n[6,6,6,6,6,6] \u2192 which is the original row followed by the same row reversed. Wait, no. Original is [6,6,6], reversed is still the same. So maybe it's original plus reversed.\n\nBut looking at the second input row [1,6,1], the output is [1,6,1,1,6,1]. So original plus original again? Because reversing [1,6,1] gives the same. Hmm, not sure yet.\n\nWait, Example 1:\n\nInput row [6,8,1] becomes [6,8,1,1,8,6]. So original is [6,8,1], then the next part is reversed [1,8,6], but concatenated. Wait, original plus reversed gives [6,8,1,1,8,6]. Yes! So that's the pattern. Each row is concatenated with its reversed version.\n\nLet me check other examples. Take Example 1's second row: input [6,1,1]. Output [6,1,1,1,1,6]. Original is [6,1,1], reversed is [1,1,6], so concatenating them gives [6,1,1,1,1,6]. That matches.\n\nSimilarly, Example 2's second row input [8,1,6] becomes [8,1,6,6,1,8]. Original reversed is [6,1,8], so concatenating gives that.\n\nSo the pattern seems to be: for each row in the input, take the original and then append its reverse to make the output row double the length.\n\nWait, but let's check Example 3's second input row: [6,6,6]. The output is [6,6,6,6,6,6]. Reversed [6,6,6], so same as original. So yes, that works.\n\nSo the transformation is taking each row, then appending the reversed version of that same row. So the output row is original followed by reversed.\n\nNow let's apply this to the test input.\n\nTest input is:\n\n[6,8,6]\n[8,6,8]\n[1,6,1]\n\nFirst row: [6,8,6]. Reverse is [6,8,6] (since it's a palindrome), so output is [6,8,6,6,8,6].\n\nSecond row: [8,6,8]. Reverse is [8,6,8], so output is [8,6,8,8,6,8].\n\nThird row: [1,6,1]. Reverse is [1,6,1], same as original. So output is [1,6,1,1,6,1].\n\nWait, but let's check the training examples. For instance, Example 0's third row input [8,8,6] becomes [8,8,6,6,8,8]. Original is [8,8,6], reversed is [6,8,8]. So concatenated gives that. So yes, the reversed row is added.\n\nSo in the test input:\n\nFirst row [6,8,6], reversed is [6,8,6] \u2192 same, so output is [6,8,6,6,8,6].\n\nSecond row [8,6,8], reversed is [8,6,8], so output [8,6,8,8,6,8].\n\nThird row [1,6,1], reversed is same \u2192 [1,6,1,1,6,1].\n\nSo the outputs for each row would be as above. Let me write that.",

        "cot_2": "Okay, let's tackle this puzzle. So, the task is to figure out the pattern that transforms the input lists into the output lists based on the training examples provided. Then apply that pattern to the test input.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the training examples one by one to see if I can spot a pattern.\n\nStarting with Example 0:\n\nInput:\n[6,6,6]\n[1,6,1]\n[8,8,6]\n\nOutput:\n[6,6,6,6,6,6]\n[1,6,1,1,6,1]\n[8,8,6,6,8,8]\n\nHmm. The output arrays are double the length of the input. Let's see. The original array is length 3, and the output is 6 elements. So each input row is being transformed into a row that's twice as long. How?\n\nLooking at the first input row [6,6,6], the output is [6,6,6,6,6,6]. That's just duplicating the original array. But wait, the second input row is [1,6,1], output [1,6,1,1,6,1]. Here, it's the original array followed by a reversed version of itself? Wait, original is [1,6,1], reversed is [1,6,1], same as original. So that's why it's duplicated. But the third input row [8,8,6] becomes [8,8,6,6,8,8]. Original is [8,8,6], then the next part is [6,8,8], which is the reverse of the original. So for the third row, the output is original + reversed. Because 8,8,6 reversed is 6,8,8. Then combining original and reversed gives the output.\n\nWait, so the pattern might be: take each row, append the reverse of the row to itself. Let's check the other examples.\n\nExample 1:\n\nInput:\n[6,8,1]\n[6,1,1]\n[1,1,6]\n\nOutput:\n[6,8,1,1,8,6]\n[6,1,1,1,1,6]\n[1,1,6,6,1,1]\n\nSo the first row input is [6,8,1]. The output is [6,8,1,1,8,6]. Let's see: original is [6,8,1], reversed is [1,8,6]. So original + reversed gives [6,8,1,1,8,6], which matches the output. Second input row [6,1,1]. Reversed is [1,1,6]. Original + reversed would be [6,1,1,1,1,6], which matches the output. Third input [1,1,6], reversed is [6,1,1]. So original + reversed would be [1,1,6,6,1,1], which is the output. So yes, this seems to fit.\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput:\n[1,1,1]\n[8,1,6]\n[6,8,8]\n\nOutput:\n[1,1,1,1,1,1]\n[8,1,6,6,1,8]\n[6,8,8,8,8,6]\n\nFirst input row [1,1,1], reversed is same as original, so output is original + reversed, which duplicates. Second input [8,1,6], reversed is [6,1,8]. So original + reversed is [8,1,6,6,1,8], which matches. Third input [6,8,8], reversed is [8,8,6]. So original + reversed is [6,8,8,8,8,6], which matches the output.\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput:\n[1,1,1]\n[1,6,6]\n[6,6,6]\n\nOutput:\n[1,1,1,1,1,1]\n[1,6,6,6,6,1]\n[6,6,6,6,6,6]\n\nFirst row same as before. Second input [1,6,6], reversed is [6,6,1], so original + reversed would be [1,6,6,6,6,1], which matches. Third row is [6,6,6], reversed same, so output is duplicated.\n\nSo the pattern seems to be that each row in the input is concatenated with its reverse to form the output row. That is, for each row, take the original elements and then append the elements in reverse order. So for example, a row [a, b, c] becomes [a, b, c, c, b, a]? Wait, wait. Wait, let's check the first example again. In example 0, the third input row is [8,8,6], reversed would be [6,8,8]. So original is [8,8,6], then reversed [6,8,8], so concatenated gives [8,8,6,6,8,8], which is the output. So yes, that's exactly what's happening. So the rule is: for each row in the input, create a new row by appending the reverse of that row to itself.\n\nSo applying this to the test input.\n\nTest Input:\n\n[6,8,6]\n[8,6,8]\n[1,6,1]\n\nProcessing each row:\n\nFirst row: [6,8,6]. Reverse is [6,8,6]. So concatenated gives [6,8,6,6,8,6]. Wait, but wait: original is [6,8,6], reversed is [6,8,6], same as original. So output would be [6,8,6,6,8,6].\n\nWait, but let's check the examples. For example, in example 3, the second input row was [1,6,6], reversed [6,6,1], so concatenated gives [1,6,6,6,6,1]. So each row is followed by its own reverse.\n\nSo the test input's first row is [6,8,6], reversed is [6,8,6], so the output row would be [6,8,6,6,8,6].\n\nSecond row: [8,6,8]. Reversed is [8,6,8]. So concatenated gives [8,6,8,8,6,8].\n\nThird row: [1,6,1]. Reversed is [1,6,1]. Concatenated gives [1,6,1,1,6,1].\n\nBut wait, looking at the training examples, when the original and reversed are the same, the output is just duplicated. Like example 0's first row [6,6,6], reversed is same, so output is [6,6,6,6,6,6]. So that's correct.\n\nBut let me check the test input rows:\n\nFirst test row: [6,8,6]. Reverse is [6,8,6], so output is [6,8,6,6,8,6].\n\nSecond test row: [8,6,8]. Reverse is [8,6,8]. Output would be [8,6,8,8,6,8].\n\nThird row: [1,6,1]. Reverse is same, so output is [1,6,1,1,6,1].\n\nSo putting it all together, the output should be:\n\n[6,8,6,6,8,6]\n\n[8,6,8,8,6,8]\n\n[1,6,1,1,6,1]\n\nBut let me check again. Wait, no: when you reverse the row, you have to reverse the order of elements. For example, if the original row is [a,b,c], reversed is [c,b,a], then concatenated becomes [a,b,c,c,b,a]. But in some of the examples, like Example 0's third row [8,8,6], reversed is [6,8,8], so concatenated gives [8,8,6,6,8,8]. So that's correct.\n\nWait, but in the test input's second row, [8,6,8], reversed would be [8,6,8], same as original, so concatenating gives [8,6,8,8,6,8]. But wait, the reversed of [8,6,8] is [8,6,8], so the output row would be original + reversed = [8,6,8] + [8,6,8] \u2192 [8,6,8,8,6,8]? Wait, no. Wait, the reversed of [8,6,8] is [8,6,8], so the concatenated row is [8,6,8,8,6,8]. Wait, but the original is [8,6,8], reversed is [8,6,8], so the concatenation is [8,6,8,8,6,8]. But when you reverse a list [a,b,c], you get [c,b,a]. So [8,6,8] reversed is [8,6,8], same as original. So the concatenated list is [8,6,8] followed by [8,6,8], resulting in [8,6,8,8,6,8].\n\nSimilarly, the third row [1,6,1] reversed is [1,6,1], so concatenated is [1,6,1,1,6,1].\n\nSo the final output should be:\n\n[6,8,6,6,8,6]\n\n[8,6,8,8,6,8]\n\n[1,6,1,1,6,1]\n\nBut let me check the training examples again to ensure that the pattern is correct.\n\nLooking at Example 1's first row:\n\nInput [6,8,1] \u2192 output [6,8,1,1,8,6]. Original is [6,8,1], reversed is [1,8,6]. So concatenated gives [6,8,1,1,8,6], which matches.\n\nAnother example: Example 2's third row input [6,8,8], reversed is [8,8,6], so output is [6,8,8,8,8,6].\n\nSo the pattern holds. Therefore, applying the same to the test input should give the correct output."
