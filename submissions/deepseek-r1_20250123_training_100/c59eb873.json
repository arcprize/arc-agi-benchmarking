        "cot_1": "Okay, let's see here. I need to figure out the pattern from the training examples that transforms the input into the output. Let me start by looking at each example closely.\n\nStarting with Example 0. The input is a 3x3 matrix:\n\n[0,5,1]\n[5,5,5]\n[2,5,0]\n\nAnd the output is a 6x6 matrix where each row in the input is transformed into two rows, each with elements doubled. Wait, no. Let me check. The original input row [0,5,1] becomes [0,0,5,5,1,1], and this is repeated twice. So each element in the input row is duplicated, turning each element into two of the same. Then each row in the input becomes two identical rows in the output. So for example, the first input row becomes two output rows, each being the original elements duplicated. And the same applies to all rows.\n\nLooking at Example 1: input is two rows, [2,1] and [3,1]. The output has four rows. Each input row becomes two output rows where each element is duplicated. So [2,2,1,1] and then repeated. So same as the first example: duplicate each element in the row and then duplicate the entire row once. So for each row in input, output has two copies of that row, each with elements doubled.\n\nExample 2's input is a 4-row matrix. The output has 8 rows, each original row is transformed into two rows with elements duplicated. For example, the first input row [2,0,3,0] becomes [2,2,0,0,3,3,0,0], which is the original elements each repeated twice. Then this row is duplicated again. So each input row becomes two identical output rows, each with elements duplicated.\n\nSo the pattern is: For each element in each input row, duplicate it once, so each element becomes two in a row. Then, for each original row in the input, create two identical rows in the output with this duplication.\n\nSo the transformation steps are:\n\n1. Take each row in the input.\n2. For each element in the row, repeat it twice. So the row length doubles.\n3. Then, create two copies of this new row in the output.\n\nApplying this to the test input.\n\nThe test input is 5 rows:\n\n[2, 0, 0, 7, 8]\n[2, 1, 1, 0, 0]\n[0, 5, 6, 6, 0]\n[3, 5, 6, 0, 0]\n[0, 5, 0, 0, 0]\n\nEach of these rows should be transformed into two rows in the output, with each element duplicated. Let's take the first row as an example: [2,0,0,7,8]. Each element becomes two, so [2,2,0,0,0,0,7,7,8,8]. Wait, but wait, looking back at the examples. In Example 0, the input row [0,5,1] becomes [0,0,5,5,1,1], which is each element repeated twice. So the original row length was 3, output row length 6. Similarly, in Example 1, input rows of length 2 become output rows of length 4.\n\nSo for the first test row [2,0,0,7,8], which has 5 elements, the transformed row would be each element duplicated: 2 becomes 2,2; 0 becomes 0,0; then another 0 becomes 0,0; 7 becomes 7,7; 8 becomes 8,8. So the transformed row is [2,2,0,0,0,0,7,7,8,8]. Then this row is duplicated twice in the output. So each input row leads to two identical output rows with the duplicated elements.\n\nWait, but in the examples, each input row becomes two output rows. So for each input row, two output rows, each being the duplicated elements. So for the test input, each of the 5 rows will become 2 rows in the output, making 10 rows total.\n\nLet me check the examples again to confirm. Example 0 had 3 input rows, output 6 rows. Example 1 had 2 input rows, output 4. Example 2 had 4 input rows, output 8. So yes, the number of rows doubles. So the test input has 5 rows, so the output should have 10 rows, each original row becoming two.\n\nNow, applying this to each test input row:\n\nFirst row [2,0,0,7,8] becomes two rows of [2,2,0,0,0,0,7,7,8,8].\n\nSecond row [2,1,1,0,0] \u2192 each element duplicated: 2,2;1,1;1,1;0,0;0,0 \u2192 [2,2,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0], two rows of that.\n\nThird row [0,5,6,6,0] \u2192 0,0;5,5;6,6;6,6;0,0 \u2192 [0,0,5,5,6,6,6,6,0,0], two rows.\n\nFourth row [3,5,6,0,0] \u2192 3,3;5,5;6,6;0,0;0,0 \u2192 [3,3,5,5,6,6,0,0,0,0], two rows.\n\nFifth row [0,5,0,0,0] \u2192 0,0;5,5;0,0;0,0;0,0 \u2192 [0,0,5,5,0,0,0,0,0,0], two rows.\n\nSo the output should be a list of these duplicated rows, each original row contributing two identical rows.\n\nSo putting it all together, each transformed row is duplicated, so each input row's transformed version appears twice in the output.",

        "cot_2": "Okay, let's look at these examples. The task is to figure out the pattern that transforms the input into the output. Let's start by examining the first training example.\n\nIn Example 0, the input is three rows of three elements each. The output has six rows, each with six elements. Wait, but looking closer, each input row becomes two identical rows in the output. For instance, the first input row [0,5,1] becomes two rows of [0,0,5,5,1,1]. So each element in the input row is doubled. Like 0 becomes 0,0; 5 becomes 5,5; 1 becomes 1,1. Then that row is repeated twice in the output. So each input row is transformed by duplicating each element and then the entire transformed row is duplicated twice. So for each input row, there are two output rows where each element is doubled.\n\nChecking Example 1: Input is two rows, each with two elements. The output has four rows. Each input row becomes two output rows. Each element is duplicated. For example, [2,1] becomes [2,2,1,1], and this is repeated twice. So the pattern holds here too.\n\nExample 2's input has four rows of four elements. The output has eight rows. Each input row is converted by duplicating each element (so four elements become eight?), wait no. Wait, input is four elements per row. Let's see the output rows. For the first input row [2,0,3,0], the output is [2,2,0,0,3,3,0,0], so each element is duplicated. Then this duplicated row is repeated twice. So each input row leads to two output rows, each being the duplicated elements. So the transformation is: for each element in the input row, double it (write it twice), then the entire transformed row is written twice in the output.\n\nSo the overall pattern seems to be:\n\n1. For each element in the input row, duplicate it. So a row of length N becomes a row of length 2N.\n2. Then, each transformed row is duplicated twice in the output. So each input row corresponds to two identical rows in the output.\n\nNow applying this to the test input. The test input has 5 rows. Let's process each row.\n\nFirst test input row: [2,0,0,7,8]. Duplicate each element: 2\u21922,2; 0\u21920,0; 0\u21920,0;7\u21927,7;8\u21928,8. So the transformed row is [2,2,0,0,0,0,7,7,8,8]. Then this row is duplicated twice. So two rows of [2,2,0,0,0,0,7,7,8,8].\n\nSecond input row: [2,1,1,0,0]. Duplicate each element: 2\u21922,2;1\u21921,1;1\u21921,1;0\u21920,0;0\u21920,0. So transformed row is [2,2,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0]. Then duplicate this row twice.\n\nThird row: [0,5,6,6,0]. Duplicate each: 0,0;5,5;6,6;6,6;0,0. So transformed row is [0,0,5,5,6,6,6,6,0,0]. Then two rows.\n\nFourth row: [3,5,6,0,0]. Transformed: 3,3;5,5;6,6;0,0;0,0 \u2192 [3,3,5,5,6,6,0,0,0,0]. Two copies.\n\nFifth row: [0,5,0,0,0]. Transformed: 0,0;5,5;0,0;0,0;0,0 \u2192 [0,0,5,5,0,0,0,0,0,0]. Two copies.\n\nSo the output should have 5 input rows \u00d7 2 each = 10 rows, each transformed as described.\n\nWait, let me check the examples again. In Example 0, the input has 3 rows, output 6 (3\u00d72). Example 1: input 2 rows, output 4. Example 2: input 4 rows, output 8. So yes, each input row is converted into two output rows. So the test input with 5 rows would produce 10 output rows.\n\nNow, putting it all together:\n\nEach input row becomes two output rows where each element is duplicated, and the entire row is repeated twice.\n\nSo the test input's first row [2,0,0,7,8] becomes two rows of [2,2,0,0,0,0,7,7,8,8]. Wait, wait, the input row has 5 elements, so after duplication each transformed row has 10 elements. Let me confirm.\n\nOriginal input row length: in Example 0, input rows of 3 elements become 6 elements (each element duplicated). In Example 1, input rows of 2 elements become 4. So the transformed row length is double the original. So for the test input rows which are 5 elements each, transformed rows would be 10 elements each.\n\nSo for each of the test input's 5 rows, output two rows where each element is duplicated. Let's write them out.\n\nFirst input row: [2,0,0,7,8] \u2192 each element doubled \u2192 [2,2, 0,0, 0,0, 7,7, 8,8]. Then two rows of this.\n\nSecond input row: [2,1,1,0,0] \u2192 [2,2,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0] \u00d72.\n\nThird: [0,5,6,6,0] \u2192 [0,0,5,5,6,6,6,6,0,0] \u00d72.\n\nFourth: [3,5,6,0,0] \u2192 [3,3,5,5,6,6,0,0,0,0] \u00d72.\n\nFifth: [0,5,0,0,0] \u2192 [0,0,5,5,0,0,0,0,0,0] \u00d72.\n\nSo the output will be 10 rows, each of length 10, arranged as follows:\n\nRow 1 and 2: [2,2,0,0,0,0,7,7,8,8]\n\nRow 3 and 4: [2,2,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow 5 and 6: [0,0,5,5,6,6,6,6,0,0]\n\nRow 7 and 8: [3,3,5,5,6,6,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow 9 and 10: [0,0,5,5,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nEach input row is transformed into two identical output rows with elements duplicated."
