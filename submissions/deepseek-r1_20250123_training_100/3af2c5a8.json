        "cot_1": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. So, looking at the training examples, each input is a 3x4 grid, and the output is a 6x8 grid. That means the output is double the size in both dimensions. Hmm, so maybe each row in the input is transformed into two rows in the output, and each element is duplicated into two elements? But let me check the examples to confirm.\n\nStarting with Example 0. The input is three rows of 4 elements each. The output has six rows, each with eight elements. Let's see how they relate. Take the first input row [0,0,8,0]. The output's first row is [0,0,8,0,0,8,0,0]. Wait, so the original row is followed by a reversed version of the original? Or maybe mirrored. Let's split that into two parts. The first four elements are [0,0,8,0], and the next four are [0,8,0,0]. Wait, that's like the original row reversed, except the middle elements. Hmm. Wait, original is [0,0,8,0]. Reversed would be [0,8,0,0], which matches the second part. So the first row in the output is the original followed by reversed original. Then the second row of the input is [0,8,0,8]. The output's second row is [0,8,0,8,8,0,8,0]. So original plus reverse again. But wait, reversing [0,8,0,8] gives [8,0,8,0], but the second part here is 8,0,8,0. So yes, original + reversed. But then the third input row is [0,0,8,0], which becomes [0,0,8,0,0,8,0,0] again. Then the next three rows of the output are the same as the first three. Wait, the output is six rows. So the first three rows are original each followed by reversed, and then the next three rows are the same as the first three, but maybe mirrored vertically? Wait, looking at the output of example 0:\n\nOriginal input rows (3 rows) transformed into 6 rows. The first three output rows are the original rows each followed by their reversed. Then the fourth row is the same as the first input row reversed again? Wait, no. Let me list the output rows for example 0:\n\nRow 1: [0,0,8,0,0,8,0,0] \u2192 input row 1 plus reversed input row 1?\nOriginal row1: [0,0,8,0], reversed is [0,8,0,0], so combined gives the first output row.\n\nRow2: [0,8,0,8,8,0,8,0] \u2192 input row2 [0,8,0,8] reversed gives [8,0,8,0], so combined as input row2 + reversed row2.\n\nRow3: [0,0,8,0,0,8,0,0] \u2192 same as row1.\n\nThen rows 4-6 are the same as rows 1-3 again? Wait, looking at example 0's output:\n\nThe output has six rows. Let's list them:\n\nRow1: [0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0]\n\nRow2: [0, 8, 0, 8, 8, 0, 8, 0]\n\nRow3: [0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0]\n\nRow4: same as row1\n\nRow5: same as row2\n\nRow6: same as row3\n\nWait, that can't be right. Wait, in example 0's output, the first three rows are:\n\nRow1: [0,0,8,0,0,8,0,0]\n\nRow2: [0,8,0,8,8,0,8,0]\n\nRow3: [0,0,8,0,0,8,0,0]\n\nThen the next three rows are:\n\nRow4: [0,0,8,0,0,8,0,0] \u2192 same as row1 and row3.\n\nRow5: [0,8,0,8,8,0,8,0] \u2192 same as row2.\n\nRow6: [0,0,8,0,0,8,0,0] \u2192 same as row1 and row3.\n\nWait, that's odd. So the output is three rows duplicated. But why?\n\nWait, maybe the input is mirrored vertically. Because the input is 3 rows, the output is 6 rows. So perhaps each input row is mirrored both horizontally and vertically. Wait, but let's think of the input as a 3x4 grid, and the output as a 6x8 grid. So the output is a mirroring along both axes.\n\nAlternatively, the transformation is to take each row, mirror it horizontally (reverse the elements) and append, then mirror the entire array vertically. Let's see.\n\nTake example 0's input:\n\nInput rows:\n\nRow1: 0 0 8 0 \u2192 mirrored horizontally becomes 0 8 0 0. So combined as row1 + mirror \u2192 [0,0,8,0,0,8,0,0].\n\nRow2: 0 8 0 8 \u2192 mirror is 8 0 8 0 \u2192 combined as [0,8,0,8,8,0,8,0]\n\nRow3: 0 0 8 0 \u2192 mirror is 0 8 0 0 \u2192 combined as [0,0,8,0,0,8,0,0]\n\nSo the first three output rows are each input row mirrored horizontally and appended. Then, the next three rows are the reverse of the first three rows? Because in example 0's output, the fourth row is same as first, fifth as second, sixth as third. Wait, no. The output's fourth row is same as first, fifth same as second, sixth same as third. So it's the same as the first three rows again. So vertically, the rows are duplicated. So the total output is twice the number of rows, but each row is duplicated.\n\nWait, in example 0, input has 3 rows, output 6. So each input row is processed into two rows? Or each input row becomes one row in output, but then duplicated. Wait, no. Let's check example 1.\n\nIn example 1's input, there are 3 rows. The output has 6 rows. Let's see:\n\nOriginal rows:\n\nRow1: 0 0 3 3 \u2192 mirror \u2192 3 3 0 0 \u2192 combined as [0,0,3,3,3,3,0,0]\n\nRow2: 0 3 0 3 \u2192 mirror \u2192 3 0 3 0 \u2192 combined as [0,3,0,3,3,0,3,0]\n\nRow3: 3 3 3 0 \u2192 mirror \u2192 0 3 3 3 \u2192 combined as [3,3,3,0,0,3,3,3]\n\nThen the output has rows:\n\nRow1: [0,0,3,3,3,3,0,0]\n\nRow2: [0,3,0,3,3,0,3,0]\n\nRow3: [3,3,3,0,0,3,3,3]\n\nThen the next three rows are:\n\nRow4: [3,3,3,0,0,3,3,3]\n\nRow5: [0,3,0,3,3,0,3,0]\n\nRow6: [0,0,3,3,3,3,0,0]\n\nAh, so the next three rows are the reverse of the first three. So rows 4,5,6 are the reverse of rows 3,2,1. So it's like the original rows are mirrored vertically. So the entire output is the original rows mirrored horizontally (each row becomes original + reversed), then mirrored vertically (rows are duplicated in reverse order).\n\nSo the process is:\n\nFor each row in the input:\n\n- Take the row and append its reverse. So each 4-element row becomes 8 elements.\n\nThen, after processing all input rows, create a mirror image vertically. That is, take the processed rows and append their reverse. So if the input has 3 rows, the output will have 6 rows: the original 3 processed rows followed by the same 3 rows in reverse order.\n\nSo for example 0:\n\nOriginal input rows:\n\nRow1: [0,0,8,0] \u2192 becomes [0,0,8,0,0,8,0,0]\n\nRow2: [0,8,0,8] \u2192 becomes [0,8,0,8,8,0,8,0]\n\nRow3: [0,0,8,0] \u2192 becomes [0,0,8,0,0,8,0,0]\n\nThen, the next three rows are the reverse of these. So rows 4,5,6 are the same as rows 3,2,1. But looking at example 0's output, the fourth row is same as row3, fifth same as row2, sixth same as row1. Wait, no. Let's check example 0's output:\n\nOutput rows:\n\n1: [0,0,8,0,0,8,0,0] \u2192 row1\n\n2: [0,8,0,8,8,0,8,0] \u2192 row2\n\n3: [0,0,8,0,0,8,0,0] \u2192 row3\n\n4: same as row3\n\n5: same as row2\n\n6: same as row1\n\nWait, that's the reverse order. So the vertical mirroring is taking the processed rows and appending their reverse. So for 3 rows, after processing, you have 3 rows. Then append the reversed list of those rows.\n\nWait, the original 3 rows become [row1_processed, row2_processed, row3_processed], then append [row3_processed, row2_processed, row1_processed]. So the total is 6 rows. That's the case in example 0.\n\nIn example 1:\n\nProcessed rows:\n\nRow1: [0,0,3,3,3,3,0,0]\n\nRow2: [0,3,0,3,3,0,3,0]\n\nRow3: [3,3,3,0,0,3,3,3]\n\nThen append reversed list: row3, row2, row1.\n\nSo output rows 4-6 are row3_processed, row2_processed, row1_processed.\n\nWhich matches the example 1's output.\n\nSimilarly, example 2:\n\nInput has 3 rows. Each row is processed by appending their reverse.\n\nRow1: [3,3,3,3] \u2192 reverse is same, so processed row is [3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3].\n\nRow2: [3,0,0,0] \u2192 reverse is [0,0,0,3] \u2192 processed row is [3,0,0,0,0,0,0,3].\n\nRow3: [3,0,0,0] \u2192 processed same as row2.\n\nThen the output is these three rows followed by their reverse: row3_processed, row2_processed, row1_processed. So rows 4-6 are [3,0,0,0,0,0,0,3], [3,0,0,0,0,0,0,3], [3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3]. Wait, but example 2's output is:\n\nOutput rows:\n\n1: [3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3]\n\n2: [3,0,0,0,0,0,0,3]\n\n3: [3,0,0,0,0,0,0,3]\n\n4: [3,0,0,0,0,0,0,3]\n\n5: [3,0,0,0,0,0,0,3]\n\n6: [3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3]\n\nWait, that's not matching. Wait the original input in example 2 is three rows: [3,3,3,3], [3,0,0,0], [3,0,0,0]. So when processed, each becomes:\n\nRow1: 3,3,3,3 reversed \u2192 same, so row1 becomes [3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3].\n\nRow2: [3,0,0,0] reversed \u2192 [0,0,0,3] \u2192 processed row is [3,0,0,0,0,0,0,3].\n\nRow3: same as row2.\n\nThen the vertical mirroring would append the reversed list of the processed rows. So original list is [row1, row2, row3]. Reversed is [row3, row2, row1]. So the output is row1, row2, row3, row3, row2, row1.\n\nLooking at example 2's output, that's exactly what's happening. So the output rows are:\n\nRow1: row1_processed.\n\nRow2: row2_processed.\n\nRow3: row3_processed.\n\nRow4: row3_processed.\n\nRow5: row2_processed.\n\nRow6: row1_processed.\n\nWhich matches example 2's output.\n\nSo the pattern is:\n\n1. For each row in the input, create a new row by appending the reverse of the original row. For example, a row [a, b, c, d] becomes [a, b, c, d, d, c, b, a].\n\nWait, wait. Wait in example 0, the original row is [0,0,8,0], reversed would be [0,8,0,0], so the new row is original + reversed: [0,0,8,0, 0,8,0,0]. Wait, but in the output, the first row is [0,0,8,0, 0,8,0,0]. So yes, original + reversed. Similarly, example 1's first row: [0,0,3,3] reversed is [3,3,0,0], so new row is [0,0,3,3,3,3,0,0]. So that's correct.\n\nThen, after processing all rows (each row becomes original + reversed), the next step is to take the list of these processed rows and append the reverse of that list. So if the input is 3 rows, the output has 6 rows: the original 3 processed rows followed by the same 3 rows in reverse order.\n\nSo for the test input, let's apply this.\n\nTest input:\n\n[4, 0, 0, 0]\n\n[0, 0, 0, 4]\n\n[4, 4, 0, 0]\n\nFirst, process each row by appending its reverse.\n\nFirst row: [4,0,0,0]. Reverse is [0,0,0,4]. So processed row: [4,0,0,0, 0,0,0,4].\n\nSecond row: [0,0,0,4]. Reverse is [4,0,0,0]. Processed row: [0,0,0,4,4,0,0,0].\n\nThird row: [4,4,0,0]. Reverse is [0,0,4,4]. Processed row: [4,4,0,0,0,0,4,4].\n\nNow, the processed rows are:\n\nRow1: [4,0,0,0,0,0,0,4]\n\nRow2: [0,0,0,4,4,0,0,0]\n\nRow3: [4,4,0,0,0,0,4,4]\n\nThen, append the reversed list of these rows. The reversed list would be row3, row2, row1.\n\nSo the output rows will be:\n\nRow1: [4,0,0,0,0,0,0,4]\n\nRow2: [0,0,0,4,4,0,0,0]\n\nRow3: [4,4,0,0,0,0,4,4]\n\nRow4: [4,4,0,0,0,0,4,4] (same as row3)\n\nRow5: [0,0,0,4,4,0,0,0] (same as row2)\n\nRow6: [4,0,0,0,0,0,0,4] (same as row1)\n\nSo combining them, the output should be:\n\n[4,0,0,0,0,0,0,4]\n\n[0,0,0,4,4,0,0,0]\n\n[4,4,0,0,0,0,4,4]\n\n[4,4,0,0,0,0,4,4]\n\n[0,0,0,4,4,0,0,0]\n\n[4,0,0,0,0,0,0,4]\n\nLet me check if this aligns with the pattern from the training examples. For example, in example 1, the third row after processing is [3,3,3,0,0,3,3,3], then row4 is the same as that. Similarly here, the fourth row would be the third processed row.\n\nYes, this seems to fit. So that's the pattern.",

        "cot_2": "Okay, let's tackle this puzzle. So, I have these training examples where an input array is transformed into an output array. My goal is to figure out the pattern and apply it to the test input. Let's look at the examples one by one.\n\nStarting with Example 0. The input is a 3x4 grid. The output is a 6x8 grid. Hmm, so the output dimensions are double the input's. Wait, 3 rows become 6, and 4 columns become 8. So each row is duplicated, and each column is duplicated as well? Let me check. \n\nLooking at the first input row [0,0,8,0]. The output's first row is [0,0,8,0,0,8,0,0]. Wait, that's the original row followed by a mirrored version? Let's see: 0,0,8,0 becomes 0,0,8,0 followed by 0,8,0,0. Wait, the original is [0,0,8,0], then the next part is [0,8,0,0]. But how does that happen? Maybe it's mirrored with some adjustment. Let me check the second input row [0,8,0,8]. The output's second row is [0,8,0,8,8,0,8,0]. Oh, the original row is followed by its reverse, but maybe with some elements flipped? Wait, original is 0,8,0,8. Reversed is 8,0,8,0. But in the output, after the original, it's 8,0,8,0. So it's the original plus reversed. Wait, yes, 0,8,0,8 followed by 8,0,8,0. But the output row is [0,8,0,8,8,0,8,0]. Wait, that's original plus reversed. So 0,8,0,8 + 8,0,8,0? Let's check. The original is 0,8,0,8. The reversed is 8,0,8,0. So combined, the row becomes 0,8,0,8,8,0,8,0. But looking at the output, the first row's input is [0,0,8,0], reversed would be [0,8,0,0], so combining gives [0,0,8,0,0,8,0,0]. Wait, but the output first row is exactly that. So maybe the pattern is that each row is concatenated with its reverse. But then, how about the number of rows? The input has 3 rows, output has 6. So each input row is duplicated, but in a certain way.\n\nWait, in Example 0's input, there are 3 rows. The output has 6 rows. Let's see how they are arranged. The first three rows of the output are the input rows each followed by their reversed. Then the next three rows are again the input rows but maybe in reverse order? Let me check:\n\nOriginal input rows:\n\nRow 0: [0,0,8,0]\n\nRow 1: [0,8,0,8]\n\nRow 2: [0,0,8,0]\n\nOutput rows:\n\nRow 0: [0,0,8,0,0,8,0,0] (original row 0 + reversed row 0)\n\nRow 1: [0,8,0,8,8,0,8,0] (original row 1 + reversed row 1)\n\nRow 2: [0,0,8,0,0,8,0,0] (original row 2 + reversed row 2)\n\nThen rows 3-5:\n\nRow 3 is same as row 0: [0,0,8,0,0,8,0,0]\n\nRow 4 is same as row 1: [0,8,0,8,8,0,8,0]\n\nRow 5 is same as row 2: [0,0,8,0,0,8,0,0]\n\nWait, no. Wait, output rows 3-5 in example 0 are:\n\nRow3: [0,0,8,0,0,8,0,0]\n\nRow4: [0,8,0,8,8,0,8,0]\n\nRow5: [0,0,8,0,0,8,0,0]\n\nSo rows 3-5 are the same as rows 0-2. So the entire output is the original rows with their reversed concatenated, followed by the same set again. But that would make the number of rows double. Wait, input has 3 rows, output has 6. So each input row is processed into two output rows? Wait no, because each input row becomes one output row (original + reversed), then the same set again. So the output is the original 3 rows (each with original+reverse) and then another copy of those same 3 rows. So the output is the input rows transformed, then mirrored vertically. Let me check.\n\nIn example 0, the output's first three rows are:\n\nRow0: original row0 + reversed row0.\n\nRow1: original row1 + reversed row1.\n\nRow2: original row2 + reversed row2.\n\nThen the next three rows are the same as the first three. So it's like stacking the transformed rows twice. But why? Because the input is 3 rows, output is 6 rows. So each input row is duplicated once. So the vertical direction is duplicated, and the horizontal direction is mirrored.\n\nWait, maybe the pattern is to mirror both horizontally and vertically. Let's consider that. For each row, mirror horizontally (concatenate with reverse), and then mirror vertically by duplicating the rows in reverse order. Wait, but in example 0, the input is 3 rows. The output is 6 rows. If you mirror vertically, you'd have the original rows and their mirror. But in example 0's output, the rows after the first three are the same as the first three. So maybe the vertical mirroring is not applied. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking the input matrix, mirroring each row horizontally (so each row becomes original + reversed), and then mirroring the entire matrix vertically (so the rows are original followed by reversed). But let's test this with example 0.\n\nOriginal input rows (3 rows):\n\nRow0: [0,0,8,0]\n\nRow1: [0,8,0,8]\n\nRow2: [0,0,8,0]\n\nMirror each row horizontally (each row becomes original + reversed):\n\nRow0 becomes [0,0,8,0,0,8,0,0]\n\nRow1 becomes [0,8,0,8,8,0,8,0]\n\nRow2 becomes [0,0,8,0,0,8,0,0]\n\nThen mirror the entire matrix vertically. So the original rows (after horizontal mirror) are followed by their mirror (so reversed order). But in example 0, the output is:\n\nOriginal transformed rows (0,1,2) followed by (0,1,2 again). Wait, but the original input's row0 and row2 are the same. So if after mirroring vertically, it would be the transformed rows in reverse order. For example, input rows are 0,1,2. Vertical mirror would be 2,1,0. So output would be transformed rows 0,1,2 followed by 2,1,0. But in example 0's output, the next three rows are 0,1,2 again. So that doesn't fit. So maybe vertical mirroring is not the case.\n\nWait, let's look at example 1. The input is 3x4:\n\nInput rows:\n\n[0,0,3,3]\n\n[0,3,0,3]\n\n[3,3,3,0]\n\nOutput is 6x8. Let's check the output rows:\n\nRow0: [0,0,3,3,3,3,0,0] (original row0 is [0,0,3,3], reversed is [3,3,0,0]? Wait, original row0 is [0,0,3,3]. Reverse is [3,3,0,0], but the output row0 is [0,0,3,3,3,3,0,0]. So that's original row0 followed by reversed row0. Then row1 is [0,3,0,3,3,0,3,0], which is original row1 [0,3,0,3] followed by reversed [3,0,3,0]. Row2 is [3,3,3,0,0,3,3,3], which is original row2 [3,3,3,0] followed by reversed [0,3,3,3]. Then the next three rows (rows3-5) are:\n\nRow3: [3,3,3,0,0,3,3,3] (same as row2)\n\nRow4: [0,3,0,3,3,0,3,0] (same as row1)\n\nRow5: [0,0,3,3,3,3,0,0] (same as row0)\n\nSo the output rows are transformed rows 0,1,2 followed by 2,1,0. So vertically mirrored. So the vertical direction is mirrored. So for each row, mirror horizontally (original + reversed row), then mirror vertically the entire array (append reversed rows). So the total rows become double. So the process is:\n\nFor each row in the input:\n\n- Create a new row by appending the reversed of that row (mirror horizontally)\n\nThen, create the vertical mirror by appending the reversed list of these transformed rows.\n\nSo for example, in example0, transformed rows are:\n\nt0, t1, t2\n\nvertical mirror is t2, t1, t0\n\nso the output is t0, t1, t2, t2, t1, t0\n\nBut wait in example0's output, the rows after the first three are t0, t1, t0 again. Wait, no:\n\nWait in example0's output, the first three rows are t0, t1, t2 (since input rows are 0,1,2). Then the next three rows are t0, t1, t2 again. But according to the vertical mirror idea, the next three should be t2, t1, t0. But that's not the case here. So maybe the vertical mirror isn't the case.\n\nHmm, this is confusing. Let's look at example1 again.\n\nIn example1, after transforming the input rows, the output rows are:\n\nt0, t1, t2, t2, t1, t0\n\nWhich is the vertical mirror. So the transformed rows are followed by the reversed list. So the full output is transformed_rows + reversed(transformed_rows). Which doubles the number of rows.\n\nIn example0, the input rows are:\n\nRow0: [0,0,8,0]\n\nRow1: [0,8,0,8]\n\nRow2: [0,0,8,0]\n\nSo transformed_rows (after appending reversed) are:\n\nt0: [0,0,8,0,0,8,0,0]\n\nt1: [0,8,0,8,8,0,8,0]\n\nt2: [0,0,8,0,0,8,0,0]\n\nThen reversed transformed_rows would be [t2, t1, t0]. So the full output would be t0, t1, t2, t2, t1, t0. But in example0's output, the rows are:\n\nt0, t1, t2, t0, t1, t2. Wait no. Let me check:\n\nOriginal example0 output:\n\nRow0: t0\n\nRow1: t1\n\nRow2: t2\n\nRow3: t0 (same as row0)\n\nRow4: t1 (same as row1)\n\nRow5: t2 (same as row2)\n\nSo it's transformed_rows followed by transformed_rows again. That's not the vertical mirror. So why in example1, the output rows are transformed_rows followed by reversed transformed_rows, but in example0, it's transformed_rows followed by transformed_rows again.\n\nHmm, that's conflicting. So maybe the vertical mirroring is not part of the pattern. Let me check example2.\n\nExample2 input:\n\n3 rows:\n\n[3,3,3,3]\n\n[3,0,0,0]\n\n[3,0,0,0]\n\nOutput is 6 rows. Let's look at the output rows:\n\nRow0: [3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3] (original row0 [3,3,3,3] + reversed row0 [3,3,3,3] \u2192 same as original)\n\nRow1: [3,0,0,0,0,0,0,3] (original row1 [3,0,0,0] reversed is [0,0,0,3], so concatenated: [3,0,0,0,0,0,0,3])\n\nRow2: same as row1.\n\nRow3: same as row1.\n\nRow4: same as row1.\n\nRow5: same as row0.\n\nWait, the output rows are:\n\nRow0: transformed row0 (original + reversed)\n\nRow1: transformed row1\n\nRow2: transformed row2 (original row2 is same as row1, so transformed row2 is same as transformed row1)\n\nThen rows3-5:\n\nRow3: transformed row2 again?\n\nRow4: transformed row1 again?\n\nRow5: transformed row0 again?\n\nWait, the output for example2 is:\n\n[3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3]\n\n[3,0,0,0,0,0,0,3]\n\n[3,0,0,0,0,0,0,3]\n\n[3,0,0,0,0,0,0,3]\n\n[3,0,0,0,0,0,0,3]\n\n[3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3]\n\nSo the transformed rows are t0, t1, t2 (t2 is same as t1). Then the vertical part is reversed. So transformed_rows is t0, t1, t2. Then reversed transformed_rows would be t2, t1, t0. But the output is t0, t1, t2, t2, t1, t0. So yes, the output is transformed_rows followed by reversed(transformed_rows).\n\nWait, but in example0, the output is transformed_rows followed by transformed_rows again. That contradicts. So what's the difference here?\n\nWait, example0's input has 3 rows. The transformed_rows would be 3 rows. If you append reversed(transformed_rows), you get 6 rows. For example0's output, the transformed_rows are:\n\nt0, t1, t2. reversed would be t2, t1, t0. So total rows would be 6: t0, t1, t2, t2, t1, t0. But in example0's actual output, the rows after the first three are t0, t1, t2 again. So that's not the case.\n\nWait this inconsistency suggests that my initial hypothesis is wrong. Let me look again.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the vertical mirror is applied to the input rows, not the transformed rows. Let's see.\n\nTake the input rows, mirror them vertically (append reversed rows), then for each of those rows, mirror them horizontally.\n\nFor example, in example0, input is:\n\nRow0, row1, row2.\n\nMirror vertically: row0, row1, row2, row2, row1, row0.\n\nThen for each of these 6 rows, mirror horizontally (append reversed).\n\nBut let's see. Let's take example0's input:\n\nOriginal input rows:\n\n0: [0,0,8,0]\n\n1: [0,8,0,8]\n\n2: [0,0,8,0]\n\nVertical mirror would be rows 0,1,2,2,1,0.\n\nThen, each row is mirrored horizontally. For example:\n\nRow0 becomes [0,0,8,0,0,8,0,0]\n\nRow1 becomes [0,8,0,8,8,0,8,0]\n\nRow2 becomes [0,0,8,0,0,8,0,0]\n\nThen row2 again: same as row2's transformed.\n\nRow1 again: same as row1's transformed.\n\nRow0 again: same as row0's transformed.\n\nSo the output would be the transformed rows in order 0,1,2,2,1,0. But in the actual example0's output, the order is 0,1,2,0,1,2. So that doesn't fit. So this approach is not correct.\n\nHmm. Maybe the process is to first mirror each row horizontally (creating a row of double length) and then mirror each column vertically (duplicating each row, but perhaps in a certain way).\n\nAlternatively, maybe each row in the output is the original row followed by its reverse, and each original row is duplicated in the output. But example0's output has each input row appearing twice. For example, input row0 appears twice (rows 0 and 3), row1 appears twice (rows1 and4), row2 appears twice (rows2 and5). So the output is each transformed input row duplicated.\n\nSo, perhaps the pattern is: for each row in the input, create a new row by appending its reversed version, then duplicate each of these transformed rows in the output.\n\nSo input rows are 3, transformed rows are 3, and each is duplicated once to make 6 rows.\n\nBut in example1's input, the output rows are transformed_rows followed by reversed transformed_rows. So in example1, the transformed rows are t0, t1, t2, and then they are reversed to t2, t1, t0. So the total is 6 rows.\n\nBut in example0, the transformed_rows are 3 rows, then duplicated again. So the output is 6 rows. So this approach is not consistent across examples.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the vertical direction is mirrored by repeating the transformed rows in reverse order. Let's check:\n\nExample0:\n\ntransformed_rows = [t0, t1, t2]\n\nvertical mirror would be [t0, t1, t2, t2, t1, t0]\n\nBut in the actual output, it's [t0, t1, t2, t0, t1, t2]. So that doesn't fit.\n\nWait, perhaps the vertical direction isn't mirrored, but instead each row is duplicated. For example, each transformed row is followed by itself again. So for 3 input rows, each transformed row is duplicated once, leading to 6 rows. But in example0, that's the case. But example1's output is different. Let's check.\n\nIn example1, the transformed rows are:\n\nt0: [0,0,3,3,3,3,0,0]\n\nt1: [0,3,0,3,3,0,3,0]\n\nt2: [3,3,3,0,0,3,3,3]\n\nThen the output rows are:\n\nt0, t1, t2, t2, t1, t0.\n\nSo it's transformed_rows followed by reversed transformed_rows. So that's different from example0. But example0's output is transformed_rows followed by transformed_rows again.\n\nSo this seems inconsistent. Maybe there's another pattern.\n\nLooking at example2's output:\n\ntransformed_rows would be:\n\nt0: [3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3]\n\nt1: [3,0,0,0,0,0,0,3]\n\nt2: [3,0,0,0,0,0,0,3]\n\nThen output is:\n\nt0, t1, t2, t2, t1, t0.\n\nWhich is transformed_rows followed by reversed transformed_rows.\n\nIn example1, same pattern. But in example0, it's transformed_rows followed by transformed_rows again.\n\nWait, this inconsistency suggests that perhaps I'm missing something. Let's re-examine the examples.\n\nExample0's input is:\n\nRow0: [0,0,8,0]\n\nRow1: [0,8,0,8]\n\nRow2: [0,0,8,0]\n\nOutput is:\n\nEach row is transformed into original + reversed. Then the entire output is the transformed rows followed by the same transformed rows again.\n\nSo rows 0-2 are transformed rows, rows3-5 are same as rows0-2.\n\nExample1's input:\n\nRow0: [0,0,3,3]\n\nRow1: [0,3,0,3]\n\nRow2: [3,3,3,0]\n\nOutput is transformed rows followed by reversed transformed rows.\n\nSimilarly, example2's output is transformed rows followed by reversed transformed rows.\n\nWait, this suggests that maybe example0 is an exception, but that's unlikely. Or perhaps I made a mistake in my analysis.\n\nLooking back at example0's input rows:\n\nRow0: [0,0,8,0]\n\nRow2: [0,0,8,0] (same as row0)\n\nSo the transformed rows would be t0, t1, t0. Then, the vertical mirror would be t0, t1, t0, t0, t1, t0. But the actual output is t0, t1, t0, t0, t1, t0. Which matches the vertical mirror (appending reversed transformed_rows). Because transformed_rows are [t0, t1, t0], reversed would be [t0, t1, t0] again. So appending reversed transformed_rows would give [t0, t1, t0, t0, t1, t0], which matches the output.\n\nBut in example0's output, the last three rows are the same as the first three. So when transformed_rows are symmetric (like when the first and last rows are same), appending reversed transformed_rows gives the same as the original. So the pattern is to append the reversed transformed_rows. So in example0, since transformed_rows is [t0, t1, t0], reversed is [t0, t1, t0], so appending gives [t0, t1, t0, t0, t1, t0], which is same as the output.\n\nSo the general pattern is:\n\n1. For each row in the input, create a new row by appending its reversed version (mirror horizontally).\n\n2. Create a new set of rows by taking the transformed rows and appending their reversed list (mirror vertically).\n\nSo the final output is transformed_rows + reversed(transformed_rows).\n\nThis seems to fit all the examples.\n\nLet's test this with example0:\n\nTransformed_rows after step 1: [t0, t1, t2] where t2 is same as t0.\n\nReversed transformed_rows would be [t2, t1, t0] \u2192 which is [t0, t1, t0].\n\nSo the output is [t0, t1, t0, t0, t1, t0]. But example0's output is:\n\n[t0, t1, t2, t0, t1, t2]. Wait, but t2 is same as t0. So it's equivalent.\n\nSo in example0, the reversed transformed_rows is [t2, t1, t0], which when appended gives the full output as [t0, t1, t2, t2, t1, t0]. But since t2 is same as t0 and t0 is same as t2, this becomes [t0, t1, t0, t0, t1, t0], which matches the output.\n\nIn example1:\n\nTransformed_rows are [t0, t1, t2].\n\nReversed transformed_rows would be [t2, t1, t0].\n\nAppending gives [t0, t1, t2, t2, t1, t0], which matches example1's output.\n\nExample2:\n\nTransformed_rows are [t0, t1, t2], where t1 and t2 are the same.\n\nReversed transformed_rows is [t2, t1, t0]. Since t2 is same as t1, and t0 is different.\n\nAppending gives [t0, t1, t2, t2, t1, t0], but in example2's output, the rows are:\n\nt0, t1, t1, t1, t1, t0. Wait, but in example2's output:\n\nRow0: t0\n\nRow1: t1\n\nRow2: t1 (since input row2 is same as row1)\n\nRow3: t1\n\nRow4: t1\n\nRow5: t0\n\nBut according to the pattern, transformed_rows + reversed(transformed_rows) would be:\n\ntransformed_rows = [t0, t1, t1]\n\nreversed = [t1, t1, t0]\n\nSo combined, [t0, t1, t1, t1, t1, t0], which matches example2's output.\n\nSo the pattern is:\n\nFor each row, create a new row by appending its reverse.\n\nThen, take these transformed rows and append their reverse order.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Mirror each row horizontally (original + reversed).\n\n2. Mirror the entire matrix vertically (append the reversed list of transformed rows).\n\nNow, applying this to the test input.\n\nTest Input:\n\n[4,0,0,0]\n\n[0,0,0,4]\n\n[4,4,0,0]\n\nFirst, process each row by appending its reversed.\n\nRow0: [4,0,0,0] reversed is [0,0,0,4]. So transformed row0 is [4,0,0,0,0,0,0,4].\n\nRow1: [0,0,0,4] reversed is [4,0,0,0]. So transformed row1 is [0,0,0,4,4,0,0,0].\n\nRow2: [4,4,0,0] reversed is [0,0,4,4]. So transformed row2 is [4,4,0,0,0,0,4,4].\n\nSo transformed_rows = [row0_transformed, row1_transformed, row2_transformed]\n\nThen, reversed transformed_rows is [row2_transformed, row1_transformed, row0_transformed]\n\nSo the output is:\n\nrow0_transformed\n\nrow1_transformed\n\nrow2_transformed\n\nrow2_transformed\n\nrow1_transformed\n\nrow0_transformed\n\nNow, let's write each transformed row:\n\nrow0_transformed: [4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4]\n\nrow1_transformed: [0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0]\n\nrow2_transformed: [4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4]\n\nSo the output rows in order would be:\n\nRow0: [4,0,0,0,0,0,0,4]\n\nRow1: [0,0,0,4,4,0,0,0]\n\nRow2: [4,4,0,0,0,0,4,4]\n\nRow3: [4,4,0,0,0,0,4,4]\n\nRow4: [0,0,0,4,4,0,0,0]\n\nRow5: [4,0,0,0,0,0,0,4]\n\nPutting this all together, the output should be as above."
