        "cot_1": "Okay, let's look at the training examples to figure out the pattern. \n\nStarting with Example 0:\nInput is three rows:\n[3, 3, 8]\n[3, 7, 0]\n[5, 0, 0]\n\nThe output is:\n[0, 0, 5]\n[0, 7, 3]\n[8, 3, 3]\n\nHmm. Let me see how they transformed. Let's compare each row. The first input row [3,3,8] becomes the last output row [8,3,3]. The second input row [3,7,0] becomes the middle output row [0,7,3]. The third input row [5,0,0] becomes the first output row [0,0,5]. \n\nSo it seems like the rows are reversed in order. The first row becomes the last, the third becomes the first. Then, within each row, the elements are reversed but with zeros added? Wait, let's check. The input third row [5,0,0] reversed would be [0,0,5], which matches the output's first row. The second input row [3,7,0] reversed is [0,7,3], which is the output's second row. The first input row [3,3,8] reversed is [8,3,3], which is the output's third row. So the entire matrix is reversed row-wise, and each individual row is reversed. \n\nLet's check Example 1 to confirm.\nInput:\n[5,5,2]\n[1,0,0]\n[0,0,0]\n\nOutput:\n[0,0,0]\n[0,0,1]\n[2,5,5]\n\nOriginal rows in input are three rows. Reversed row order would make the third input row [0,0,0] the first output row. Then the second input row [1,0,0] becomes the second output row [0,0,1], which is reversed. The first input row [5,5,2] becomes the third output row [2,5,5], reversed. So yes, same pattern: reverse the order of the rows and then reverse each individual row.\n\nSo the transformation steps are:\n1. Reverse the order of the rows in the input matrix.\n2. For each row in this reversed matrix, reverse the elements of the row.\n\nApplying this to the test input:\nTest Input:\n[6, 3, 5]\n[6, 8, 0]\n[4, 0, 0]\n\nFirst, reverse the rows. The original order is row 0, row 1, row 2. Reversed, it becomes row 2, row 1, row 0.\n\nSo reversed rows are:\n[4, 0, 0]\n[6, 8, 0]\n[6, 3, 5]\n\nThen, reverse each row. Let's do each one:\n\nFirst reversed row (original row 2): [4,0,0] reversed becomes [0,0,4]?\nWait, no. Wait, the first row after reversing rows is [4,0,0], then reverse the elements of this row. So [4,0,0] becomes [0,0,4]. But looking at the training examples, in Example 0, the input third row was [5,0,0], which became [0,0,5]. So yes, reversing the elements. Similarly, for the second reversed row [6,8,0], reversed elements would be [0,8,6]. Third reversed row [6,3,5] becomes [5,3,6]. \n\nPutting it all together, the transformed matrix would be:\n[0,0,4]\n[0,8,6]\n[5,3,6]\n\nBut wait, let's check the training examples again. In Example 0, the first input row [3,3,8] becomes the last output row [8,3,3]. So reversing the row elements. So yes, each row's elements are reversed. So the test input after processing should have the rows reversed in order and each row's elements reversed.\n\nWait, but in the Test Input, the original rows are:\n\nRow 0: [6,3,5]\nRow 1: [6,8,0]\nRow 2: [4,0,0]\n\nReversed rows order becomes Row 2, Row 1, Row 0. Then each row is reversed:\n\nRow 2 reversed: [4,0,0] \u2192 [0,0,4]\n\nRow 1 reversed: [6,8,0] \u2192 [0,8,6]\n\nRow 0 reversed: [6,3,5] \u2192 [5,3,6]\n\nSo the output matrix would be:\n\n[0,0,4]\n\n[0,8,6]\n\n[5,3,6]\n\nBut looking at the training examples' outputs, like Example 0's output:\n\n[0,0,5]\n\n[0,7,3]\n\n[8,3,3]\n\nWait, the first output row here is the reversed third input row, but in the test case, the first output row would be [0,0,4], second [0,8,6], third [5,3,6]. \n\nBut let's check if there's another pattern. For example, in Example 0, the input's third row [5,0,0] becomes [0,0,5]. So perhaps the zeros are being moved to the front. Wait, but that's the same as reversing the elements. Because the original row is [5,0,0], reversed is [0,0,5], which is the same as moving non-zero elements to the end. Wait, maybe it's reversing each row but then shifting non-zero elements to the right? No, because in the first example, the input's first row [3,3,8] becomes [8,3,3], which is reversed. Similarly, the second row [3,7,0] becomes [0,7,3], which is reversed. So the zeros stay where they are in the reversed row. \n\nSo the pattern is definitely reverse the rows' order and reverse each row's elements. So the test input's transformation would be:\n\nOriginal input rows:\n\nRow 0: [6,3,5]\n\nRow 1: [6,8,0]\n\nRow 2: [4,0,0]\n\nReverse the row order:\n\nRow 2 \u2192 [4,0,0]\n\nRow 1 \u2192 [6,8,0]\n\nRow 0 \u2192 [6,3,5]\n\nNow reverse each row's elements:\n\nRow 2 reversed: [0,0,4]\n\nRow 1 reversed: [0,8,6]\n\nRow 0 reversed: [5,3,6]\n\nSo the output matrix should be:\n\n[0,0,4]\n\n[0,8,6]\n\n[5,3,6]\n\nBut let's check if there's another possible pattern. For example, maybe the matrix is rotated 180 degrees. Rotating 180 degrees would be equivalent to reversing the order of all elements. Let me see:\n\nFor a 3x3 matrix, rotating 180 would involve swapping elements such that each element moves to the position 180 degrees from its original. But in the examples, for example, Example 0's input:\n\nOriginal matrix:\n\n3 3 8\n\n3 7 0\n\n5 0 0\n\nRotated 180 would result in:\n\n5 0 0 \u2192 becomes first row reversed as third row, etc. Wait, 180 rotation would be equivalent to reversing each row and then reversing the order of the rows. So first, reverse each row, then reverse the rows. Wait, maybe that's the same as the pattern. Let's see. \n\nIn Example 0, the process is reverse each row, then reverse the rows. Let's test:\n\nOriginal rows:\n\nRow 0: [3,3,8] reversed \u2192 [8,3,3]\n\nRow 1: [3,7,0] reversed \u2192 [0,7,3]\n\nRow 2: [5,0,0] reversed \u2192 [0,0,5]\n\nNow, reverse the order of the rows:\n\n[0,0,5], [0,7,3], [8,3,3] \u2192 which matches the output. So yes, the transformation is to reverse each row and then reverse the order of the rows. Alternatively, rotating the matrix 180 degrees. \n\nSo the steps are: For each row, reverse the elements, then reverse the order of the rows. \n\nSo applying this to the test input:\n\nTest input rows:\n\n[6,3,5]\n\n[6,8,0]\n\n[4,0,0]\n\nFirst, reverse each row:\n\nRow 0: [5,3,6]\n\nRow 1: [0,8,6]\n\nRow 2: [0,0,4]\n\nThen reverse the order of the rows:\n\nRow 2 becomes first, row 1, then row 0:\n\n[0,0,4], [0,8,6], [5,3,6]\n\nSo the output should be:\n\n[0,0,4]\n\n[0,8,6]\n\n[5,3,6]\n\nWhich matches what I thought earlier. So the answer should be this.",

        "cot_2": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. So, looking at the training examples. \n\nStarting with Example 0. The input is three rows:\n[3, 3, 8]\n[3, 7, 0]\n[5, 0, 0]\n\nThe output is:\n[0, 0, 5]\n[0, 7, 3]\n[8, 3, 3]\n\nHmm. Let's see how the input transforms to output. Maybe looking at each row. Let's compare the first input row to the last output row. The first input row is [3,3,8], and the output's last row is [8,3,3]. Oh, that's reversed. So the first row becomes the last row reversed. \n\nThen the second input row is [3,7,0]. The output's second row is [0,7,3]. Again reversed. And the third input row [5,0,0] becomes the first output row [0,0,5], which is reversed as well. Wait, but the output rows are in reverse order of the input rows, each reversed. So the entire matrix is rotated 180 degrees? Because rotating 180 would flip each row and reverse the order of rows. Let me check. \n\nOriginal input rows: row1, row2, row3. Output rows are row3 reversed, row2 reversed, row1 reversed. So the order of rows is reversed, and each row is reversed. That's exactly a 180-degree rotation. \n\nLet me check Example 1. Input:\n[5,5,2]\n[1,0,0]\n[0,0,0]\n\nOutput:\n[0,0,0]\n[0,0,1]\n[2,5,5]\n\nOriginal input rows: row1 [5,5,2], row2 [1,0,0], row3 [0,0,0]. Output rows are row3 reversed (0,0,0 stays same), row2 reversed (0,0,1), row1 reversed (2,5,5). So yes, same pattern. Reverse each row and reverse the order of the rows. So applying 180 rotation.\n\nSo the pattern is: take each row of the input matrix, reverse their order, and reverse each individual row. So for the test input:\n\nTest Input:\n[6,3,5]\n[6,8,0]\n[4,0,0]\n\nWe need to reverse the order of the rows. Original order is row1, row2, row3. So reversed order would be row3, row2, row1. Then reverse each of those rows. \n\nOriginal rows in order:\n\nRow3: [4,0,0] reversed becomes [0,0,4]\nRow2: [6,8,0] reversed becomes [0,8,6]\nRow1: [6,3,5] reversed becomes [5,3,6]\n\nSo the output matrix should be:\n\n[0,0,4]\n[0,8,6]\n[5,3,6]\n\nWait, wait. Wait the original test input is:\n\nRow1: [6,3,5]\nRow2: [6,8,0]\nRow3: [4,0,0]\n\nReversed row order would be row3, row2, row1. So output rows are:\n\nReverse row3: [4,0,0] becomes [0,0,4]\nReverse row2: [6,8,0] becomes [0,8,6]\nReverse row1: [6,3,5] becomes [5,3,6]\n\nSo combining them, the output matrix is:\n\n[0,0,4]\n[0,8,6]\n[5,3,6]\n\nWait, but looking at the training examples. In example 0, the input's third row was [5,0,0], which became the first output row [0,0,5]. So yes, reversed rows in order and each row reversed.\n\nSo applying that pattern to the test input should give the output as:\n\nFirst, take the original rows in reverse order: [4,0,0], [6,8,0], [6,3,5]. Then reverse each of these rows:\n\n[4,0,0] reversed \u2192 [0,0,4]\n\n[6,8,0] reversed \u2192 [0,8,6]\n\n[6,3,5] reversed \u2192 [5,3,6]\n\nSo the output matrix is:\n\n[0,0,4]\n\n[0,8,6]\n\n[5,3,6]\n\nBut wait, in the training examples, the output of example 0 had the third row as [8,3,3], which is the reversed first row of input. So yes, same pattern here. So the test output should be as above."
