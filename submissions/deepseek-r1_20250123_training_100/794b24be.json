        "cot_1": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. So, we have these 3x3 grids where the input is transformed into an output. The outputs all have 2s and 0s. Let's look at the training examples to see what's going on.\n\nStarting with Example 0. Input is:\n\n[0, 0, 0]\n[1, 0, 0]\n[0, 0, 0]\n\nOutput is:\n\n[2, 0, 0]\n[0, 0, 0]\n[0, 0, 0]\n\nHmm. The 1 in the middle of the first column becomes a 2 in the top left. Maybe it's moving up? But wait, in the input, the 1 is in the second row, first column. The output has a 2 in the first row, first column. So that 1 moves up by one and turns into a 2. But why?\n\nLooking at Example 1. Input:\n\n[0, 1, 0]\n[1, 0, 0]\n[0, 0, 0]\n\nOutput:\n\n[2, 2, 0]\n[0, 0, 0]\n[0, 0, 0]\n\nHere, there are two 1s: one in the first row middle, and one in the second row first column. The output has two 2s in the first row. So maybe each 1 is moving up, and possibly combining. But how? Wait, in the input, the 1 in the first row middle is already at the top. Where does it go? In the output, it becomes a 2. Maybe it's not moving. Maybe it's something else.\n\nAnother idea: maybe each 1 in the input is converted into a 2, and then propagates to adjacent cells. But looking at Example 0, the single 1 becomes a 2 in the same position. Wait, no. Wait, in Example 0 input, the 1 is in the second row first column. Output is 2 in the first row first column. So the 1 moves up a row. Then in Example 1, the two 1s are at (0,1) and (1,0). The output has (0,0) and (0,1) as 2s. Wait, maybe each 1 is moving up as much as possible. The (0,1) 1 is already at the top, so maybe it can't move up. The (1,0) 1 moves up to (0,0). But then why does (0,1) become a 2? Unless perhaps the 1 in (0,1) is moving to the left? No, that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's a kind of \"gravity\" where 1s fall upward and combine. Or maybe the 1s are converted to 2s in their position, and also affect neighboring cells. But how?\n\nWait, let's take Example 2:\n\nInput:\n[0,0,1]\n[0,0,0]\n[1,0,0]\n\nOutput:\n[2,2,0]\n[0,0,0]\n[0,0,0]\n\nThe input has 1s at (0,2) and (2,0). The output has 2s at (0,0) and (0,1). Hmm. How do those positions relate? If the 1 at (0,2) is moving left two positions? That doesn't make sense. Or maybe each 1 is moving upwards as far as possible, but how? The 1 at (0,2) is already at the top. The 1 at (2,0) moves up to (0,0)? Because in example 0, the 1 in row 1 moves up to row 0. So maybe each 1 moves up to the top row, but if there's another 1 in the same column, they combine. Wait, in Example 0, the 1 is in row 1, column 0. It moves up to row 0, column 0. Then in Example 1, the 1 in row 1, column 0 moves up to row 0, column 0, and the 1 in row 0, column 1 stays? But in the output, both (0,0) and (0,1) are 2. So maybe when a 1 moves up, it turns into a 2, and if there's another 1 in the same target cell, they add up? But 1+1=2. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps all 1s in the input are being \"collected\" into the top row, each contributing 1 to their column's top cell. So if a column has a 1 in any row, the top cell of that column becomes a 2. Let's check:\n\nExample 0: input has a 1 in column 0. Output top of column 0 is 2. That fits.\n\nExample 1: columns 0 and 1 have 1s. Output top of both columns 0 and 1 are 2. That fits.\n\nExample 2: input has 1s in column 2 (top row) and column 0 (bottom row). So top of column 0 and column 2. But the output has 2s in columns 0 and 1. Wait, that doesn't fit. Hmm. Wait, maybe I'm missing something. Let me check Example 2 again.\n\nInput Example 2:\n\nRow 0: [0,0,1]\n\nRow 1: [0,0,0]\n\nRow 2: [1,0,0]\n\nSo columns:\n\nColumn 0: rows 0,1,2 \u2192 0,0,1 \u2192 has a 1 in row 2.\n\nColumn 1: all 0.\n\nColumn 2: row 0 has 1, others 0.\n\nSo according to the previous idea, columns 0 and 2 have 1s. Then output top row would have 2s in columns 0 and 2. But the output is [2,2,0], so columns 0 and 1. That doesn't match. So my initial idea is wrong.\n\nAlternative approach: perhaps the 1s in the input are being moved up and to the left, and when they reach the top or left edge, they spread or combine.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s in the output are indicating the number of 1s in adjacent cells (including diagonally) from the input. But let's check.\n\nExample 0's input has a single 1 at (1,0). The output has a 2 at (0,0). If we count the neighbors of (0,0) in the input: down (1,0) is 1. So neighbor count is 1. But output is 2. So that's not matching.\n\nAnother thought: maybe each 1 in the input turns into a 2 in the same cell and propagates to adjacent cells. But in Example 0, the 1 at (1,0) would turn into 2, but in the output, (0,0) is 2, not (1,0). So maybe when a 1 is present, it converts the cell above it into a 2. So in Example 0, the 1 at (1,0) affects the cell above (0,0) turning it into 2. Then the original 1 is set to 0. So the output's (0,0) is 2, and (1,0) becomes 0. That could fit.\n\nLet's test this with Example 1. Input has 1s at (0,1) and (1,0). For (0,1), the cell above would be out of bounds, so maybe it can't move up. So the cell (0,1) would stay as 1, but according to the output, it's a 2. Hmm, that's conflicting. Alternatively, maybe each 1 converts the cell above to a 2, and the original 1 disappears. So in Example 1, the 1 at (1,0) would convert (0,0) to 2. The 1 at (0,1) can't move up, so maybe it converts itself to a 2. So in the output, (0,0) and (0,1) are 2s. That fits Example 1's output.\n\nIn Example 2, the input has 1 at (0,2) and (2,0). The 1 at (2,0) moves up two cells to (0,0), becoming 2. The 1 at (0,2) can't move up, so becomes 2. But the output is [2,2,0]. So why is there a 2 in (0,1)? That doesn't fit. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe when a 1 moves up, it affects all cells along the way. So moving from (2,0) to (0,0) would set each cell above to 2. But then (2,0) would have to set (1,0) and (0,0) to 2. But in Example 0, moving from (1,0) to (0,0) would set (0,0) to 2. In that case, Example 2's input would have the 1 at (2,0) moving up, setting (1,0) and (0,0) to 2. The 1 at (0,2) becomes 2. So output would be:\n\n[2,0,2]\n\nBut the actual output is [2,2,0]. So that doesn't fit. So maybe that's not the pattern.\n\nLet me think differently. Let's look at all the outputs. Each output has 2s only in the top row and sometimes the second row. For example, in Example 7's output, there's a 2 in the second row. Let's see the input for Example 7:\n\nInput:\n[1,1,0]\n[0,0,0]\n[1,0,1]\n\nOutput:\n[2,2,2]\n[0,2,0]\n[0,0,0]\n\nSo here, the top row has all 2s except third element. But the second row has a 2 in the middle. Hmm. How does that happen?\n\nAlternative approach: Maybe the number of 1s in each column affects the output. Let's check Example 0's input: column 0 has one 1. Output column 0 has a 2. Example 1: columns 0 and 1 have one 1 each. Output columns 0 and 1 have 2 each. Example 2: columns 0 and 2 have one 1 each. Output columns 0 and 1 have 2s. Wait, that doesn't add up. So maybe that's not it.\n\nWait, maybe the 2s are the sum of the 1s in each column. But Example 0's column 0 sum is 1, which becomes 2. Example 1's columns 0 and 1 sum to 1 each, output 2s. So perhaps the sum is multiplied by 2. But then why in Example 2, columns 0 and 2 sum to 1 each, but the output is 2 in columns 0 and 1. That doesn't fit. Hmm.\n\nAnother idea: Maybe the output is the count of 1s in the same row and all rows below, but that doesn't seem to fit either.\n\nLooking at Example 3:\n\nInput:\n\n[0,1,0]\n[0,0,1]\n[0,0,0]\n\nOutput:\n\n[2,2,0]\n[0,0,0]\n[0,0,0]\n\nInput has 1s at (0,1) and (1,2). Output has 2s in (0,0) and (0,1). So maybe each 1 in any row causes the cells to the left in the top row to become 2s. For example, the 1 at (0,1) would cause (0,0) and (0,1) to be 2? But how does that work. The 1 at (1,2) is in column 2. So perhaps each 1 in column c contributes to the leftmost available position in the top row. Maybe there's a process where 1s are moving up and left, filling the top row from the left.\n\nAlternatively, think of it as pouring the 1s into the top row from left to right. Each 1 in the input grid is \"poured\" into the top row, filling the leftmost empty spot. If multiple 1s are in the same column, they stack. But how does that lead to 2s.\n\nWait, looking at Example 5:\n\nInput:\n\n[1,1,0]\n[0,0,0]\n[1,0,0]\n\nOutput:\n\n[2,2,2]\n[0,0,0]\n[0,0,0]\n\nInput has three 1s. Output top row has three 2s. So maybe each 1 in the input becomes a 2 in the top row, starting from the left. But the positions might depend on their original columns. Wait, but in Example 2, there are two 1s. Output has two 2s. Example 5 has three 1s, output has three 2s.\n\nBut in Example 7's input, there are four 1s (positions (0,0), (0,1), (2,0), (2,2)). The output has four 2s (top row three 2s and second row one 2). So maybe the number of 2s equals the number of 1s. So each 1 is converted to a 2, but their positions are determined by some rule.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each 1 in the input causes the cell in the top row, same column, to become a 2. But if there are multiple 1s in the same column, the top cell becomes 2 (regardless of number of 1s). Then, any 1s in the same row would cause adjacent cells to be 2s. But this is getting complicated.\n\nLet me think about Example 2 again. Input has 1s at (0,2) and (2,0). The output top row is [2,2,0]. So why are there 2s in columns 0 and 1? If the 1 at (2,0) causes the top of column 0 to be 2. The 1 at (0,2) is already in column 2's top row, so that becomes 2. But the output has column 1 as 2. So that's not matching. So perhaps the movement isn't directly column-based.\n\nAlternative approach: look for how the positions of the 1s in the input relate to the positions of the 2s in the output.\n\nTake Example 0: input 1 is at (1,0). Output 2 is at (0,0). So up one row, same column.\n\nExample 1: input 1s at (0,1) and (1,0). Output 2s at (0,0) and (0,1). So the (1,0) moves up to (0,0), and the (0,1) stays but becomes 2.\n\nExample 2: input 1s at (0,2) and (2,0). Output 2s at (0,0) and (0,1). So the (2,0) moves up two rows to (0,0), and the (0,2) moves left two columns to (0,0)? Or maybe the (0,2) moves left, but how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 1s are moving as far up as possible and as far left as possible. So each 1 moves up until it can't, then moves left. But how does that work.\n\nWait, in Example 2's input, the 1 at (0,2) is already as up as possible. Maybe it moves left as far as possible. So from column 2 to column 0? But that's two steps. The output's (0,0) and (0,1) are 2s. Hmm, maybe each 1 splits into two 2s when moving left. But that's not clear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the sum of all 1s in the same row and all rows above. But in Example 0, the sum for row 0 would be 1 (from row 1). So output row 0 is 2. Maybe sum times 2. But example 1's input row 0 has one 1, row 1 has one 1. Sum for row 0 is 1 (its own 1) plus row 1's 1? So sum is 2, which is the output. But in the output of example 1, row 0 is 2,2,0. So sum for each column? Column 0 and 1 each have one 1, so 2 each. Column 2 has 0. That fits. But in Example 2, input columns 0 and 2 have 1 each. Output columns 0 and 1 have 2s. That doesn't fit. So maybe that's not the case.\n\nAnother angle: looking at the outputs, the 2s are always in the first few columns of the top row(s). Maybe the 1s are being \"stacked\" from left to right in the top row. Each 1 in the input contributes to a 2 in the leftmost available position in the top row. If there are multiple 1s, they fill the top row left to right. Let's check.\n\nExample 0: one 1 \u2192 one 2 in (0,0).\n\nExample 1: two 1s \u2192 two 2s in (0,0) and (0,1).\n\nExample 2: two 1s \u2192 two 2s in (0,0) and (0,1).\n\nExample 3: two 1s \u2192 two 2s in (0,0) and (0,1).\n\nExample 4: one 1 \u2192 one 2 in (0,0).\n\nExample 5: three 1s \u2192 three 2s in (0,0), (0,1), (0,2).\n\nExample 6: three 1s (input rows 0,1 have 1,1 and 1,1,0) \u2192 three 2s in top row.\n\nExample 7: four 1s \u2192 four 2s (three in top row, one in second row).\n\nWait, Example 7's output has four 2s: top row three and one in the second row. So the pattern might be that the 2s are filled left to row in the top row, and once the top row is filled, they start filling the next row left to right.\n\nSo the algorithm could be:\n\n- Collect all the 1s from the input grid, count them as N.\n- In the output grid, fill 2s starting from the top row, left to right, then the next row left to right, until N 2s are placed.\n- All other cells are 0.\n\nWait, let's test this hypothesis.\n\nExample 0: 1 \u2192 one 2 in (0,0). Correct.\n\nExample 1: two 1s \u2192 two 2s in (0,0) and (0,1). Correct.\n\nExample 2: two 1s \u2192 two 2s in (0,0) and (0,1). Correct.\n\nExample 3: two 1s \u2192 same as above. Correct.\n\nExample 4: one 1 \u2192 (0,0). Correct.\n\nExample 5: three 1s \u2192 top row filled with three 2s. Correct.\n\nExample 6: three 1s \u2192 three 2s in top row. Correct.\n\nExample 7: four 1s \u2192 three in top row and one in second row first column. Correct.\n\nExample 8's input has four 1s (assuming input is [0,1,0], [1,1,0], [1,0,0] \u2192 1+2+1=4? Let me check:\n\nInput Example 8:\n\nRow 0: [0,1,0] \u2192 one 1.\n\nRow 1: [1,1,0] \u2192 two 1s.\n\nRow 2: [1,0,0] \u2192 one 1.\n\nTotal: 4 1s. Output has four 2s: top row three (but 3 cells) and second row one. So three in top row and one in second row. That fits. So the total number of 1s in the input is equal to the number of 2s in the output, placed left to right, top to bottom.\n\nYes, this seems to fit all examples. Let's verify:\n\nExample 7's input:\n\nRow 0: [1,1,0] \u2192 two 1s.\n\nRow 1: [0,0,0].\n\nRow 2: [1,0,1] \u2192 two 1s.\n\nTotal: 4 \u2192 output has four 2s (3 in top row and 1 in row 1, column 1). Wait, but in the output of Example 7, it's [2,2,2], [0,2,0], ... \u2192 three in top row, one in row 1. So total four 2s. Correct.\n\nAnother example: Example 9's input:\n\n[1,0,0]\n[0,0,1]\n[0,1,1]\n\n1 in row 0, 1 in row 1, 2 in row 2. Total 4 1s. Output has four 2s: three in top row, one in row 1 (middle). Correct.\n\nSo the pattern is:\n\n1. Count the total number of 1s in the input grid.\n2. In the output grid, replace cells starting from the top-left, moving left to right, top to bottom, placing a 2 in each cell until all counted 1s are represented. The remaining cells are 0.\n\nSo for the test input:\n\nTest Input:\n[0,1,0]\n[0,0,0]\n[0,1,0]\n\nSo counting the 1s: row 0 has one (position 1), row 2 has one (position 1). Total two 1s. Therefore, the output should have two 2s in the first two cells of the top row.\n\nSo output would be:\n\n[2,2,0]\n[0,0,0]\n[0,0,0]\n\nWhich matches the format of the training examples.",

        "cot_2": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. So, the input is a 3x3 grid of 0s and 1s, and the output is another 3x3 grid with 2s and 0s. I need to see how the input transforms into the output across these examples.\n\nLooking at Example 0: The input has a 1 in the second row, first column. The output has a 2 in the first row, first column. So maybe the 1 is moving up? But then in Example 1, there are two 1s: one in the first row middle and the second row first column. The output has two 2s in the first row. Hmm, maybe it's spreading. Wait, let's check each example step by step.\n\nIn Example 0's input:\nRow 0: [0,0,0]\nRow 1: [1,0,0]\nRow 2: [0,0,0]\nOutput:\nRow 0: [2,0,0]\nOthers 0. So the 1 in (1,0) becomes a 2 in (0,0). Maybe the cell above becomes 2?\n\nExample 1:\nInput has (0,1) and (1,0) as 1s. Output has [2,2,0] in row 0. So both (0,1) and (1,0) might be causing their upper cells to turn into 2s. Wait, (0,1) is already in the top row. So if a 1 is in row 0, maybe it affects something else. Or perhaps each 1 in the grid propagates a 2 upwards, but if there's no row above, maybe wraps around? But Example 0's 1 is in row 1, moves to row 0. But in Example 1, the 1 in row 0 (0,1) would have to do something else. Alternatively, maybe it's the sum of adjacent cells? Or maybe it's counting the number of 1s in certain positions and turning them into 2s in a particular direction.\n\nWait, let's look at another example. Example 2's input has two 1s: (0,2) and (2,0). The output is [2,2,0] in the first row. So maybe each 1's position affects the top row. How? The 1 at (0,2) is already in the top row. The 1 at (2,0) is in the bottom row. So perhaps each 1 in the grid contributes to a 2 in the top row's cell corresponding to their column. For example, the 1 at (1,0) in Example 0 causes a 2 at (0,0). The 1s in (0,1) and (1,0) in Example 1 become 2s at (0,0) and (0,1)? Wait, Example 1's output has [2,2,0], so (0,0) and (0,1) are 2. The input 1s are at (0,1) and (1,0). So maybe each 1 in any row, their column in the top row becomes 2. So for each 1 in the grid, the top row's same column gets a 2. But wait, in Example 0, the 1 is in column 0, so top row column 0 becomes 2. In Example 1, the two 1s are in column 1 and 0. So top row columns 1 and 0 become 2. That seems to fit. But what about Example 2: input has 1s at (0,2) and (2,0). Then top row columns 2 and 0 would become 2. But the output is [2,2,0], which would imply columns 0 and 1. Wait, that doesn't match. So maybe that's not the pattern.\n\nAlternative approach: Maybe the output's 2s are in the positions where there are 1s in the input, but shifted up by one row. But for Example 0, the 1 is in row 1, column 0. Shifting up would put it in row 0, column 0, which matches. Example 1 has a 1 in row 0, column 1. Shifting up would go to row -1, which doesn't exist. Maybe wrapping around? But that would put it at row 2, but output is row 0. Hmm, maybe not.\n\nWait, looking at Example 5's input: [1,1,0], [0,0,0], [1,0,0]. Output is [2,2,2], others 0. The input 1s are in (0,0), (0,1), and (2,0). So if each 1's row is considered, maybe the output's first row has 2s in all columns where there are 1s in any row. Wait, but (2,0) would contribute to (0,0) in the output. How?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output counts the number of 1s in each column across all rows and turns that into 2s in the top row. For example, in Example 0: column 0 has one 1 (row 1), columns 1 and 2 have none. So top row becomes [2,0,0]. Example 1: columns 0 (row1) and 1 (row0) have 1 each. So top row [2,2,0]. Example 2: column 0 (row2) and column 2 (row0) have 1s. But output is [2,2,0]. Wait, that doesn't match. Column 0 has a 1, column 2 has a 1. So top row would be [2,0,2], but the output is [2,2,0]. So that doesn't fit.\n\nHmm, maybe it's not column-based. Let's look at Example 7's input:\n[1,1,0]\n[0,0,0]\n[1,0,1]\nOutput:\n[2,2,2]\n[0,2,0]\n[0,0,0]\nSo in the output, row 1 has a 2 in column 1. How does that come from the input? Input has 1s at (0,0), (0,1), (2,0), (2,2). The output's top row is all 2s. Maybe each 1 in the input converts to 2s in a certain direction. For example, perhaps each 1 turns into a 2 in the cell above it, and if that's not possible, maybe wraps around or affects other cells. But Example 7's output has a 2 in row 1, column1. Where did that come from? The input has no 1s in row1. Wait, maybe there's a different rule here.\n\nAlternative idea: Maybe the output is created by \"activating\" cells in the grid based on the presence of 1s, and the activation spreads upward or in some direction. For example, each 1 in the grid converts to a 2 in the cell directly above it. If the cell above is out of bounds, it might wrap around or not contribute. Then, for multiple 1s in the same column, the 2s stack in the row above. Let's test this.\n\nExample 0: 1 at (1,0). So above is (0,0), which becomes 2. Output matches.\n\nExample 1: 1s at (0,1) and (1,0). The 1 at (0,1) can't move up (since it's already top row), so maybe it doesn't contribute. The 1 at (1,0) moves up to (0,0). But output is [2,2,0]. So that doesn't fit. Unless the 1 at (0,1) somehow affects the same row. Hmm.\n\nAnother possibility: Each 1 converts the cell to the left and above into 2. But not sure. Let's think of Example 1: 1s at (0,1) and (1,0). The output is [2,2,0]. If the 1 at (1,0) affects (0,0), and the 1 at (0,1) affects ( -1, 0) which is invalid, so maybe only (0,0) gets a 2. But output has two 2s, so that doesn't fit.\n\nWait, maybe the output is the sum of all the 1s in the same column but in lower rows. For example, for each column in the output's row 0, count the number of 1s in that column in the input in all rows below (including the same row?), and if any, set to 2. Let's check:\n\nExample 0: Column 0 has a 1 in row1. So row0, column0 is 2. Others 0. Correct.\n\nExample1: Column0 has a 1 in row1. Column1 has a 1 in row0. So row0 columns0 and1 are 2. Output matches [2,2,0].\n\nExample2: Column0 has a 1 in row2. Column2 has a 1 in row0. So row0 columns0 and2. But output is [2,2,0]. Hmm, that's columns0 and1. So this doesn't fit. So maybe not.\n\nAlternative approach: Let's look for each example's output and see how many 2s there are compared to the input's 1s.\n\nExample0: 1 input \u2192 1 output. Example1: 2 inputs \u2192 2 outputs. Example2: 2 inputs \u2192 2 outputs. Example3: 2 inputs \u21922 outputs. Example4: 1 input \u21921 output. Example5:3 inputs \u21923 outputs. Example6:3 inputs \u21923 outputs. Example7:4 inputs \u21924 outputs (3 in first row, 1 in second). Example8:4 inputs \u21924 outputs. Example9:3 inputs \u21923 outputs. So the number of 2s equals the number of 1s. So each 1 is converted to one 2. But where?\n\nLooking at Example2: input 1s are at (0,2) and (2,0). Output 2s at (0,0) and (0,1). How? So the 1s' positions are (row, column) (0,2) and (2,0). The output 2s are (0,0) and (0,1). Wait, that doesn't correspond. Hmm.\n\nAnother idea: Perhaps the output is created by moving each 1 upward as much as possible, converting to 2. For instance, each 1 moves up one cell, and if that cell is occupied by another 1, maybe they combine. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe each 1 in the input is transformed into a 2 in the top row, left-aligned. For example, all the 1s are converted into 2s in the first available leftmost positions in the top row. Let's see:\n\nExample0: 1 input \u2192 one 2 in first position. Correct.\n\nExample1: two 1s \u2192 two 2s in first two positions. Output [2,2,0]. Correct.\n\nExample2: two 1s \u2192 two 2s in first two positions. Output [2,2,0]. Even though the 1s are in (0,2) and (2,0), the output's top row is filled left. So maybe the 2s are placed from left to right, regardless of where the 1s were. So the total number of 1s determines how many 2s are in the top row, left-aligned. But then, what about when there are 1s in multiple columns?\n\nWait, Example7's input has four 1s: (0,0), (0,1), (2,0), (2,2). The output has four 2s: three in the top row, one in row1, column1. So this contradicts the idea of left-aligned in top row. Because there's a 2 in row1. So perhaps there's a different pattern.\n\nLooking at Example7's output: first row has three 2s, second row has one 2. So total 4, which matches the four 1s. So each 1 is converted to a 2 somewhere. How are they placed?\n\nAlternatively, the 2s are placed in the positions that are adjacent (in some direction) to the 1s. For example, each 1 turns into a 2 in the cell above, and if that's occupied, it wraps around or moves elsewhere. But in Example7's input, (0,0) would have no cell above, so maybe the 2 is placed somewhere else. Alternatively, the 2 is placed in a diagonal or adjacent cell. Not sure.\n\nWait, let's think about Example7's output. The input has 1s at (0,0), (0,1), (2,0), (2,2). The output has 2s at (0,0), (0,1), (0,2), (1,1). So perhaps each 1's 2 is placed in a certain direction. For example:\n\n- For a 1 in (i,j), the 2 is placed in (i-1, j), unless i=0, then (i, j-1) or something. But for (0,0), moving up would be impossible, so maybe move left. But (0,0) left is out of bounds. So maybe wrap around. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, for each 1, the 2 is placed in the cell diagonally up-left. But that's just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, the 2s are placed in all cells that are in the same row as the 1s but shifted in a certain way. This is getting complicated. Let's look for another approach.\n\nAnother observation: In some examples, the output has 2s in the same row as the input's 1s but shifted. For example, Example3's input has 1s at (0,1) and (1,2). Output has 2s at (0,0) and (0,1). Hmm, not sure.\n\nWait, Example7's input 1s are in rows 0 and 2. Output has 2s in row0 and row1. So maybe the 1s in even rows (0,2) contribute to row0, and odd rows (row1) contribute to row1. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are placed in the row above each 1, and when a 1 is in row0, it wraps around to the bottom row. But in Example7's input, 1s in row0 would wrap to row2. But the output in Example7 has 2s in row0 and row1. So that might not fit.\n\nAlternatively, the 2s are placed in the cells that are adjacent to each 1. For example, each 1 turns into a 2 in the cell above it. If there's no cell above (i=0), then the 2 is placed to the left. But again, not sure.\n\nLet's take another approach. Let's compare the input and output for each example.\n\nExample0: input 1 at (1,0) \u2192 output 2 at (0,0).\n\nExample1: input 1s at (0,1) and (1,0) \u2192 output 2s at (0,0) and (0,1).\n\nExample2: input 1s at (0,2) and (2,0) \u2192 output 2s at (0,0) and (0,1).\n\nExample3: input 1s at (0,1) and (1,2) \u2192 output 2s at (0,0) and (0,1).\n\nWait, in Examples 2 and 3, even though the 1s are in different positions, the output is the same. So the position of the 1s affects where the 2s are placed, but not directly in the same columns. So perhaps it's a priority based on the original positions. Like, the 1s are sorted in some order, and their columns are filled left in the top row.\n\nFor example, collect all columns of the 1s, sort them, and fill the top row left to right. Let's see:\n\nExample2: 1s are in columns 2 and 0. Sorted columns: 0,2. So top row would be 0: 2, then 2:2, but output is [2,2,0]. Hmm, that would need columns 0 and 1. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, the columns are taken modulo something. Maybe the sum of the row and column? For instance, each 1's row and column are added, and the sum determines where the 2 is placed.\n\nAlternatively, each 1's position (i,j) is converted to (i', j') where i' is i-1 mod 3 (so moving up one row), and j' is j. But in Example0, (1,0) \u2192 (0,0), which works. Example1, (0,1) would \u2192 (2,1) if wrapping, but the output doesn't have a 2 there. So that's not it.\n\nWait, but in Example7, the output has a 2 in (1,1). How does that happen? Let's see the input 1s in Example7: (0,0), (0,1), (2,0), (2,2). If moving up each 1: (0,0) would go to row -1 (invalid), (0,1) to row -1, (2,0) to row1, (2,2) to row1. So those in row2 move up to row1. So row1 would get (0,0) \u2192 but input has row1 as [0,0,0]. The output has [0,2,0] in row1. So 2 in (1,1). How does that come from the 1s?\n\nAlternative idea: The 2s are placed in the same column as the 1s but in the row above. If the 1 is in row0, then the 2 is in row2 (wrapping). Let's test:\n\nExample0: (1,0) \u2192 row0, column0 \u2192 correct.\n\nExample1: (0,1) \u2192 row2, column1. (1,0) \u2192 row0, column0. So output would have 2s at (0,0) and (2,1). But actual output has (0,0) and (0,1). So that's not matching.\n\nHmm. Maybe the 2s are placed in the row above, but if the row above is not available (like row0), then it's placed in the same row, but shifted left. For example, 1 in (0,j) \u2192 2 in (0,j-1). Let's check Example1: 1s at (0,1) and (1,0). (0,1) would go to (0,0) since no row above, and (1,0) goes to (0,0). So both would contribute to (0,0). But output has [2,2,0], which would need two different positions. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2 is placed diagonally up-left. So (i,j) \u2192 (i-1, j-1). If i-1 is negative, wrap to row2. If j-1 is negative, wrap to column2. Let's see:\n\nExample0: (1,0) \u2192 (0,-1) \u2192 wraps to column2. So 2 at (0,2). But output is (0,0). Doesn't fit.\n\nAnother approach: Looking at the outputs, the first row is filled with 2s left to right up to the number of 1s. For example, Example0 has 1 1 \u2192 one 2 in first position. Example1 has 2 1s \u2192 first two positions. Example2 has 2 1s \u2192 first two. Example5 has 3 \u2192 all three. Example7 has 4 \u2192 three in first row, one in second. Wait, but 4 would require four cells, but each row has three. So maybe after filling the first row, it continues in the second row. So for Example7's input (4 1s), output's first row is filled with 3 2s, and the fourth 2 is in the second row's middle. So maybe the 2s are filled row-wise, left to right, top to bottom, with the number of 2s equal to the number of 1s. So each 1 in the input is converted to a 2 in the output, placed sequentially from the top-left, row by row.\n\nLet's test this hypothesis. For example:\n\nExample0: 1 1 \u2192 [2,0,0] in first row. Correct.\n\nExample1: 2 1s \u2192 [2,2,0] in first row. Correct.\n\nExample2: 2 1s \u2192 [2,2,0] in first row. Correct.\n\nExample3: 2 1s \u2192 same as Example1.\n\nExample4: 1 \u2192 [2,0,0]. Correct.\n\nExample5: 3 \u2192 fill first row: [2,2,2]. Correct.\n\nExample6: 3 \u2192 same as Example5. Correct.\n\nExample7: 4 \u2192 fill first row (3), then next in second row's first available: [2,2,2], [2,0,0]. But the output for Example7 is [2,2,2], [0,2,0]. So that doesn't fit. Because the fourth 2 is in second row's middle column, not first.\n\nHmm. So maybe the order isn't row-wise left to right. Maybe it's column-wise. So fill the first column top to bottom, then next column. For example, for four 2s: fill first column rows0,1,2, then second column row0. But in Example7's output, the fourth 2 is in (1,1). That doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, the 2s are placed in the same order as the 1s' positions sorted in a specific way. For example, sorted by row, then column. Let's see:\n\nExample7's input 1s are at (0,0), (0,1), (2,0), (2,2). Sorted by row (ascending), then column: (0,0), (0,1), (2,0), (2,2). So the 2s would be placed in the first four positions row-wise: first three in row0, then next in row1. So output would be row0: [2,2,2], row1: [2,0,0]. But the actual output is row0: [2,2,2], row1: [0,2,0]. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAnother observation: In Example7's output, the 2s are in positions (0,0), (0,1), (0,2), (1,1). The input 1s are at (0,0), (0,1), (2,0), (2,2). The 2s in (0,0) and (0,1) correspond to the input 1s in those positions. The 1s at (2,0) and (2,2) are converted to 2s at (0,0) and (0,2) in row0, but there's also a 2 in (1,1). Hmm, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are placed in the same row as the 1s but shifted left. For example, in Example7's (2,0) \u2192 row2, column0. Shifting left might be row2, column-1 (invalid), so maybe wrap to column2. But that's not matching the output.\n\nThis is getting really confusing. Let's try to find another pattern. Let's look at the outputs again:\n\n- In all examples, the output's first row has 2s. The second and third rows have 0s except when there are more than three 1s. For example, Example7 has four 1s, so the first three 2s are in the first row, and the fourth is in the second row.\n\nWait, Example7's input has four 1s. Output has three 2s in first row, one in second row. So the 2s are filled left to right, top to bottom, with each row filled left to right before moving to the next row. So for Example7, three 2s in row0, then one in row1, first available position (leftmost). But in Example7's output, the second row's 2 is in column1. That doesn't fit. Because the first row is filled, then row1's leftmost is (1,0), but output has (1,1). So that's conflicting.\n\nAnother idea: The 2s are placed in the positions that are diagonally up from the 1s. For example, each 1 at (i,j) becomes a 2 at (i-1, j-1). If out of bounds, perhaps wrap around. Let's test:\n\nExample0: (1,0) \u2192 (0,-1) \u2192 wrap column to 2? So (0,2). But output is (0,0). No.\n\nExample1: (0,1) \u2192 (-1,0) \u2192 wrap row to 2, so (2,0). (1,0) \u2192 (0,-1) \u2192 wrap column to 2. So output would have 2s at (2,0) and (0,2). But actual output is (0,0) and (0,1). So this doesn't fit.\n\nAnother angle: Let's think of the output as a kind of \"compression\" where all 1s are moved to the top rows, converted to 2s. So the 2s are in the earliest possible positions in the top rows. For example, the number of 2s equals the number of 1s, and they're filled row-wise left to right. So for Example7, four 1s \u2192 three in row0, one in row1, first column. But the output in Example7 has a 2 in row1, column1. So that's not matching.\n\nWait, in Example7's output, the second row's 2 is at (1,1). How does that happen? Let's look at the input. Maybe the 1s in the input's row2 (positions (2,0) and (2,2)) contribute to the second row's 2s. Like, each 1 in row i contributes to a 2 in row i-1, same column. So row2's 1s become row1's 2s. And row0's 1s become row0's 2s. So:\n\nExample7's input 1s:\nRow0: (0,0), (0,1) \u2192 remain in row0 as 2s.\nRow2: (2,0), (2,2) \u2192 become row1's (1,0) and (1,2) as 2s.\nBut the output is row0: [2,2,2], row1: [0,2,0]. So this doesn't explain the 2 in (1,1).\n\nAlternatively, the 1s in even rows (0 and 2) are moved up, and those in odd rows (1) are moved down. Not sure.\n\nLet me try to see if there's a pattern in the position of the 2s relative to the 1s. For each 1 in the input, what is the position of the corresponding 2 in the output.\n\nExample0: 1 at (1,0) \u2192 2 at (0,0).\n\nExample1: 1 at (0,1) \u2192 2 at (0,1)? No, output has (0,0) and (0,1). Wait, input has two 1s. Let's see:\n\nIn Example1, the output is [2,2,0]. So two 2s. The input 1s are at (0,1) and (1,0). So each 1 is converted to a 2 in (0,0) and (0,1)? How?\n\nMaybe for each 1 in column c, the output's top row in column (c-1) mod 3 becomes 2. So:\n\nExample0's 1 is in column0 \u2192 (0-1) mod3 = 2. But output is column0. Doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, for each 1 in row i, column j, the output's row is i-1 and column j. If i-1 is negative, then j is shifted left by 1. For example:\n\nExample0's 1 is at (1,0) \u2192 (0,0). Correct.\n\nExample1's 1s: (0,1) \u2192 i-1 is -1, so shift left: (0,0). (1,0) \u2192 (0,0). So both would map to (0,0), but output has two 2s. So that's not possible.\n\nAlternatively, for each 1 at (i,j), the output 2 is placed at (max(0, i-1), j). So:\n\nExample0: (1,0) \u2192 (0,0). Correct.\n\nExample1: (0,1) \u2192 (0,1) (since i-1 is -1, but max(0, -1) is 0). (1,0) \u2192 (0,0). So output has (0,0) and (0,1). Correct.\n\nExample2's input has (0,2) and (2,0). So (0,2) becomes (0,2). (2,0) becomes (1,0). So output would have 2s at (0,2) and (1,0). But the actual output is [2,2,0], which is (0,0) and (0,1). Doesn't fit. So this pattern is incorrect.\n\nHmm. Maybe the rule is that each 1 at (i,j) results in a 2 at (0, j - i). But not sure.\n\nWait, let's take another example. Example5's input: [1,1,0], [0,0,0], [1,0,0]. So 1s at (0,0), (0,1), (2,0). Output is [2,2,2]. So for each of these:\n\n(0,0) \u2192 2 at (0,0).\n\n(0,1) \u2192 2 at (0,1).\n\n(2,0) \u2192 2 at (0,0) (since 2-0=2? Not sure). But output is three 2s, so maybe each 1 is placed in (0,j) regardless of row. But how does the (2,0) 1 become a 2 in (0,0)?\n\nAlternatively, the output's first row is the sum of all the 1s in each column. If a column has at least one 1, set to 2. Example0: column0 has 1, others 0 \u2192 [2,0,0]. Correct.\n\nExample1: columns0 and1 have 1s \u2192 [2,2,0]. Correct.\n\nExample2: columns0 and2 have 1s \u2192 [2,0,2], but output is [2,2,0]. So that's not matching.\n\nSo that can't be it.\n\nAnother idea: The output is the first row with each cell being 2 if there's a 1 in any row in that column. But Example2's input has 1s in columns0 and 2. Output's first row is [2,2,0], which doesn't align. So no.\n\nAlternatively, the output is the first row where each cell is 2 if there's a 1 in the same column but in a higher row. For example, for column0: if any row below row0 (rows1 and2) has a 1, then row0's column0 is 2. So:\n\nExample0: column0 has a 1 in row1 \u2192 row0's column0 is 2. Correct.\n\nExample1: column0 has a 1 in row1 \u2192 row0's column0 is 2. Column1 has a 1 in row0 \u2192 not higher, so no. But output's column1 is 2. So this doesn't fit.\n\nHmm.\n\nThis is really challenging. Let's try to find another approach. Maybe the output's 2s are in the positions that are the sum of the positions of the 1s. For example, each 1's coordinates (row, column) are added modulo 3 to get the output position. But this is a stretch.\n\nExample0: 1 at (1,0). Sum (1,0). Maybe (1,0) mod 3 is (1,0). Output is (0,0). Doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, the output cell (i,j) is a 2 if there's a 1 in (i+1,j) mod 3. So:\n\nFor output cell (0,j), check if input has (1,j). Example0: input (1,0) \u2192 output (0,0) is 2. Correct.\n\nExample1: input has (1,0) \u2192 output (0,0) is 2. Also has (0,1). To check output (0,1) is 2, would need input (1,1). But input has (0,1), not (1,1). So this doesn't fit.\n\nAnother possibility: The output's 2s are in the positions where the cell above (in the input) has a 1. For example, output cell (i,j) is 2 if input cell (i+1,j) is 1. With wrap-around.\n\nExample0: output (0,0) is 2 because input (1,0) is 1. Correct.\n\nExample1: output (0,0) is 2 (input (1,0)), output (0,1) is 2 (input (1,1) is 0, but input (0,1) is 1. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, the output cell (i,j) is 2 if there's a 1 in (i-1,j). Example0: output (0,0) is 2 because input ( -1,0) which is invalid, so no. Doesn't fit.\n\nI'm stuck. Let's try to think differently. Maybe the output is the result of some cellular automaton-like rule. For example, each 1 in the input spreads to adjacent cells as 2s. Let's check:\n\nExample0: 1 at (1,0) \u2192 spreads to adjacent cells (0,0), (1,1), (2,0). But output only has (0,0). So this doesn't fit.\n\nAnother thought: The output is the top row filled with 2s up to the number of 1s, and any remaining 2s are placed in the next row. For example, if there are four 1s, first three in top row, next one in row1, leftmost available.\n\nExample7 has four 1s \u2192 three in top row, one in row1's leftmost. But output in Example7 has row1's 2 at (1,1), not (1,0). So that's not it.\n\nAlternatively, the 2s are placed in the same positions as the 1s, but shifted up by one row. If they can't shift up, they're placed in the same row. For example:\n\nExample0's 1 at (1,0) \u2192 shifts up to (0,0). Correct.\n\nExample1's 1 at (0,1) \u2192 can't shift up, stays at (0,1). The other 1 at (1,0) \u2192 shifts to (0,0). So output would have (0,0) and (0,1). Which matches the output.\n\nExample2's input 1s are at (0,2) and (2,0). (0,2) stays, (2,0) shifts up to (1,0). So output would have 2s at (0,2) and (1,0). But the output is [2,2,0]. So this doesn't fit. So that's not the rule.\n\nWait, but in Example2's output, the 2s are in the first two positions of row0. How do the input 1s lead to that? Maybe the 2s are placed in the top row, left to right, in the order of the 1s' columns. For example, the first column where a 1 appears (left to right, top to bottom) fills the top row. So:\n\nExample2's input has 1s in columns 2 and 0. So the order of columns is 0 and 2. So the top row's first two columns are filled: [2,2,0]. This matches the output.\n\nExample7's input has 1s in columns 0,1,0,2. So columns are 0,1,0,2. The first three in top row (columns0,1,2), then fourth in row1, column0. But output has row1's 2 at column1. So this doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. Maybe the columns are considered in the order of the input's 1s, sorted by their row, then column. For example, 1s are processed in order of rows from top to bottom, left to right. So:\n\nExample7's 1s are at (0,0), (0,1), (2,0), (2,2). Processing order: (0,0), (0,1), (2,0), (2,2). So fill top row columns0,1,2, then row1 column0. So output would have [2,2,2] in row0 and [2,0,0] in row1. But Example7's output has [2,2,2] in row0 and [0,2,0] in row1. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, the columns are sorted in ascending order, and filled left to right. For Example7's 1s, columns are 0,1,0,2 \u2192 sorted columns: 0,0,1,2. So fill row0: columns0,1,2 (three 2s), then row1: column0 (but output is row1 column1). Doesn't fit.\n\nThis is really tricky. Let's look for a different approach. Maybe the output is generated by counting the number of 1s in each row and distributing the 2s in the rows above.\n\nFor example, each row's 1s contribute to the row above. So:\n\nRow0's 1s are added to row0 (can't go higher).\n\nRow1's 1s are added to row0.\n\nRow2's 1s are added to row1.\n\nBut how?\n\nExample0: row1 has one 1 \u2192 row0 gets one 2. Correct.\n\nExample1: row0 has one 1 (adds to row0), row1 has one 1 (adds to row0). So row0 has two 2s. Correct.\n\nExample2: row0 has one 1, row2 has one 1 (adds to row1). So row0 has one 2, row1 has one 2. But output is row0 two 2s. So this doesn't fit.\n\nExample7: row0 has two 1s \u2192 row0 two 2s. Row2 has two 1s \u2192 row1 two 2s. So output row0: two 2s, row1: two 2s. But actual output is row0 three 2s, row1 one. So no.\n\nAnother possibility: Each 1 in the grid turns into a 2 in the cell directly above it. If there's no cell above, it wraps around to the bottom row. So:\n\nExample0's 1 in row1 \u2192 row0.\n\nExample1's 1 in row0 \u2192 wraps to row2. So output would have 2s in row0 (from row1's 1) and row2 (from row0's 1). But Example1's output has 2s in row0. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, when a 1 is in row0, it's moved to the same column in row0. So no change. But Example1's 1 in row0, column1 would become a 2 in row0, column1. But the output has 2 in row0, column0 and 1. So not sure.\n\nI'm really stuck here. Let's try to see if there's a pattern in the outputs' structure.\n\nLooking at all examples:\n\nThe outputs have the 2s clustered in the top row(s), with the number of 2s equal to the number of 1s. The positions seem to be filled left to right, row by row, but in some cases, like Example7, the 2s are in different positions.\n\nWait, Example7's input has 4 1s. Output has 4 2s: 3 in the first row and 1 in the second. The first row is filled left to right, then the second row. But in Example7's output, the second row's 2 is in the middle, not the first column. That breaks the pattern. Unless there's another rule for how the 2s are placed.\n\nAnother idea: The 2s are placed in the positions that are the sum of the 1s' rows and columns modulo something. Or perhaps each 1 contributes to multiple 2s based on some rule.\n\nAlternatively, the output is generated by looking at each cell in the input, and for each 1, turning all cells in the same row to the left into 2s. For example, a 1 at (i,j) turns all cells in row i from column 0 to j into 2s. Let's test:\n\nExample0: 1 at (1,0). So row1, columns 0. So output row1's columns 0 \u2192 2. But output is row0, column0. Doesn't fit.\n\nExample1: 1 at (0,1) \u2192 turn row0 columns0 and1 into 2s. 1 at (1,0) \u2192 turn row1 column0 into 2. So output row0: [2,2,0], row1: [2,0,0]. But the output has row0 as [2,2,0] and row1 as [0,0,0]. So that's not matching.\n\nAlternatively, each 1 turns all cells to the left in its row into 2s. So a 1 at (i,j) makes cells (i,0) to (i,j) into 2s. Then the output is the sum of all such ranges. For example:\n\nExample1's input 1s at (0,1) and (1,0). So row0, columns0-1 become 2s. Row1, column0 becomes 2. Output would be row0 [2,2,0], row1 [2,0,0]. But the actual output has row0 [2,2,0], row1 [0,0,0]. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAnother possibility: Each 1 turns into a 2 in the same row, but shifted to the left by the row number. For example, a 1 at (i,j) becomes a 2 at (i, j - i). If j -i is negative, wrap around.\n\nExample0's 1 at (1,0) \u2192 j -i = 0 -1 = -1 \u2192 mod3, 2. So column2. But output is column0. Doesn't fit.\n\nThis is getting too frustrating. Maybe I should look for a different pattern. Let's think of the output as the cumulative count of 1s in each column up to that row. But Example0's column0 has one 1, so output would have 2 in column0. Which matches. Example1 has column0 and1 each with one, so output [2,2,0]. Correct. Example2 has column0 (row2) and column2 (row0). So output column0 has one, column2 has one \u2192 [2,0,2]. But output is [2,2,0]. So no.\n\nWait, but the output in Example2 is [2,2,0], which implies columns0 and1. So maybe it's not column counts. \n\nAnother angle: Let's think of the output as a binary representation of the input. For example, each row is summed in binary and converted to decimal, then mapped to 2s. But I don't see how.\n\nAlternatively, each row in the input is treated as a binary number, converted to decimal, and that number is the number of 2s in the output's first row. But Example0's first row is 0, second is 4 (binary 100), third is 0. So 4 \u2192 four 2s? But output has one.\n\nNo. Not matching.\n\nWait, maybe the output is the sum of all the 1s in each diagonal. For example, the main diagonal (0,0), (1,1), (2,2). Example0 has 1s not on diagonal. Example1's 1s are at (0,1) and (1,0), which are off-diagonal. Output has two 2s. But I don't see how that translates.\n\nI'm really stuck. Let's look at the test input and see if I can find a pattern there.\n\nTest input:\n[0, 1, 0]\n[0, 0, 0]\n[0, 1, 0]\n\nSo three 1s: (0,1), (2,1). How would this transform?\n\nLooking at similar training examples:\n\nExample1 has two 1s, one in (0,1) and (1,0) \u2192 output [2,2,0].\n\nExample3 has 1s in (0,1) and (1,2) \u2192 output [2,2,0].\n\nExample6 has three 1s \u2192 output [2,2,2].\n\nTest input has two 1s in columns1: (0,1) and (2,1). If the pattern is that each 1 contributes to a 2 in the top row's same column, then columns1 would have two 1s, but the top row can only have one 2. So that can't be. Alternatively, if each 1 in any row contributes a 2 to the top row's column (i.e., column1 for these 1s), then the top row column1 would be 2. But there are two 1s in column1, so the top row would have one 2. So that's possible. But in Example1, there's a 1 in column0 (row1) and column1 (row0), and the output has both columns0 and1 as 2. So the number of 1s per column in the input affects the output's top row. But why in Example2, the output is [2,2,0] when the input has 1s in columns0 and2.\n\nAlternatively, the output's top row has 2s in all columns where there's at least one 1 in any row below. For example, in Example1, column0 has a 1 in row1, column1 has a 1 in row0. So row0's columns0 and1 are 2. But in Example2, column0 has a 1 in row2, column2 has a 1 in row0. So row0's columns0 and2 would be 2. But the output is columns0 and1. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAt this point, I'm not sure about the exact pattern. But based on the training examples, when there are multiple 1s in different columns, the output's top row fills left to right with 2s equal to the number of 1s. So for the test input, which has two 1s in column1 (rows0 and2), the output would have two 2s in the top row's leftmost columns. So [2,2,0] in the top row. But wait, in Example3, two 1s in columns1 and2, but output is [2,2,0]. So maybe it's not based on the columns of the 1s but the count.\n\nSo for the test input, which has two 1s, the output's top row would be [2,2,0], and the other rows 0. So the output would be:\n\n[2,2,0]\n[0,0,0]\n[0,0,0]\n\nBut let's check if this fits any similar examples. Example1's input has two 1s and output has two 2s. Example2's input has two 1s and output has two 2s. So yes, the number of 2s equals the number of 1s, filled left to right in the top row.\n\nSo the pattern might be: For each 1 in the input, place a 2 in the top row, left to right, filling the first available positions. If the top row is filled, continue in the second row left to right, and so on.\n\nApplying this to the test input, which has two 1s, the top row's first two positions would be 2s. So output is:\n\n[2,2,0]\n[0,0,0]\n[0,0,0]\n\nBut the test input's 1s are in (0,1) and (2,1). According to this pattern, it doesn't matter where the 1s are; their count determines the number of 2s filled left to right.\n\nLooking at Example7, which has four 1s, the output has three in the top row and one in the second row's middle. This contradicts the left-to-right filling, but perhaps there's another rule when the top row is full. Maybe after the top row is filled, the next 2s are placed in the same columns in the next row. For example, first fill top row left to right, then middle row left to right. So for four 1s:\n\nFill row0: [2,2,2], then row1: [2,0,0]. But Example7's output has row1's 2 at (1,1). So that doesn't fit.\n\nThis is confusing, but based on the majority of examples, the number of 2s equals the number of 1s, filled left to right in the top row, then moving to the next row. So for the test input, two 1s \u2192 top row two 2s.\n\nThus, the answer should be:\n\n[2,2,0]\n[0,0,0]\n[0,0,0]\n\nBut let me check Example3's input and output. Example3's input has 1s at (0,1) and (1,2). The output is [2,2,0]. So two 1s \u2192 two 2s in the top row, left to right. Even though the 1s are in columns1 and 2, the output fills the first two columns. So this supports the pattern.\n\nTherefore, the test input's output should be:\n\n[2,2,0]\n[0,0,0]\n[0,0,0]"

        "cot_1": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. So, the task is to look at these input grids and see how they transform into the output grids. Let me start by going through each example one by one and see if I can spot any rules.\n\nLooking at Example 0:\nInput is three rows. The middle of the first row has a 1, others are 0. The output has a 2 in the first position of the first row, and everything else is 0. Hmm. So maybe the 1 in the input turns into a 2 in the output, but why that position? Wait, the input's first row is [0,0,0], second row [1,0,0], third [0,0,0]. The output's first row is [2,0,0], the rest zeros. Wait, the 1 is in the second row's first element. The output's 2 is in the first row's first element. So maybe it's moving up? Or perhaps there's some kind of neighbor consideration.\n\nExample 1:\nInput has first row [0,1,0], second [1,0,0], third all zeros. Output's first row is [2,2,0]. So two 2s here. The input has two 1s? Wait, no. The first row's second element is 1, and the second row's first is 1. So two 1s. The output has two 2s in the first row. Maybe each 1 in the input is causing a 2 in the output, but their positions might be transformed. Let's see.\n\nIn Example 0, the input 1 was at (2,1) if rows are 1-based. Output's 2 is at (1,1). So maybe each 1 in the input causes a 2 in the cell above it? But in Example 1, there's a 1 in (1,2) and (2,1). If each 1's above cell gets a 2, then (0,2) and (1,1) would be 2s. But the output in Example 1 is first row [2,2,0], which is (0,0) and (0,1). Hmm, that doesn't align. So maybe not just moving up.\n\nWait, maybe it's about the sum of the 1s and their positions. Let me check another example.\n\nExample 2:\nInput is first row [0,0,1], third row [1,0,0]. Output is first row [2,2,0]. So two 1s, output has two 2s. The input's 1s are at (1,3) and (3,1). Output's 2s are at (1,1) and (1,2). So not sure. Maybe it's combining their positions in some way.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output 2s are determined by the positions of the 1s in the input, but with some transformation. Let's think of each 1 in the input as contributing to certain cells in the output. For example, each 1 might add a 2 to the cell above it, and to the left, etc. Maybe like a spread.\n\nLooking at Example 0 again: input 1 is at (2,1). The output 2 is at (1,1). So directly above. Example 1: input 1s at (1,2) and (2,1). Output has (1,1) and (1,2) as 2s. So maybe each 1's row-1 position? Wait, (1,2) in input: row 1, column 2. If we subtract 1 from the row index, (0,2) but output is [2,2,0], which would be (0,0) and (0,1). Hmm, not matching. Alternatively, maybe the 1s are acting as sources that affect certain cells in the output.\n\nWait, maybe it's a cellular automaton kind of rule. Like, each cell in the output is 2 if there's a 1 in the input in a neighboring cell (or some other condition). Let's test that.\n\nIn Example 0, the 1 is at (2,1). Output has (1,1) as 2. So maybe the cell above becomes 2. If that's the case, then in Example 1, the two 1s are at (1,2) and (2,1). Their upper cells would be (0,2) and (1,1). But the output's first row is [2,2,0], which is (0,0) and (0,1). That doesn't align. So maybe that's not it.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the sum of all 1s' positions in a certain way. For example, each 1 in the input contributes to the output in the cell that's as high as possible. Like, the topmost possible row.\n\nWait, let's look at Example 2's input. The two 1s are in (1,3) and (3,1). The output is [2,2,0] in the first row. So maybe each 1's column is considered, and in the first row, those columns are summed. But (1,3) would contribute to column 3, but the output's first row's third element is 0. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe the output is combining all the 1s in the input into the first row, but how? In Example 0, there's one 1 in the second row, first column. The output's first row has a 2 in first column. Example 1: two 1s, one in first row second column and second row first column. Output's first row has 2s in first and second columns. So maybe each 1 in any row contributes to the first row's columns. Like, if there's a 1 in column j of any row, then the first row's column j becomes 2. But that doesn't fit. Example 0's 1 is in column 1 (second row), so first row column 1 is 2. Example 1's 1s are in column 2 (first row) and column 1 (second row), so first row's columns 1 and 2 become 2. That matches. Let's check Example 2. Input has 1 in column 3 (first row) and column 1 (third row). So according to this, the first row's columns 1 and 3 would have 2s. But the output is [2,2,0]. Wait, that doesn't fit. Because the first row's column 3 has a 1, but the output's column 3 is 0. So that theory is incorrect.\n\nHmm. Let's think again. Let's see the output grids. In all examples, the output has 2s only in certain positions. Let's see the positions:\n\nExample 0: [2,0,0] in first row.\n\nExample 1: [2,2,0] in first.\n\nExample 2: [2,2,0] in first.\n\nExample3: [2,2,0].\n\nExample4: [2,0,0].\n\nExample5: [2,2,2].\n\nExample6: [2,2,2].\n\nExample7: [2,2,2] in first row, and [0,2,0] in second.\n\nExample8: [2,2,2], second row [0,2,0].\n\nExample9: [2,2,2], second row [0,2,0].\n\nSo, looking at the outputs, the 2s seem to be spreading. Maybe the rule is that each 1 in the input causes 2s in all cells that are to the left and above, but that's just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's based on the number of 1s in the input. Like, for each 1, you add 2s in certain positions. Let's see Example5: input has three 1s (first row first and second, third row first). Output has three 2s in first row. Wait, no: the output's first row has three 2s, but three 1s in input. Hmm. So maybe the number of 2s in the output is equal to the number of 1s in the input? Not exactly. For example, Example1 has two 1s, output has two 2s. Example0 has one 1, output has one 2. Example2 has two 1s, output has two 2s. But Example5 has three 1s, output has three 2s in first row. Example7's input has four 1s? Let's check. Example7's input is:\n\n[1,1,0]\n\n[0,0,0]\n\n[1,0,1]\n\nSo that's four 1s. The output's first row has three 2s, second row has one 2. Total four 2s. So that matches. So the number of 2s equals the number of 1s in the input. That seems to hold. Let's confirm with Example9. Input:\n\n[1,0,0]\n\n[0,0,1]\n\n[0,1,1]\n\nSo 1s at (1,1), (2,3), (3,2), (3,3). Four 1s. Output has three 2s in first row, one in second row (total four). Yes. So that's a pattern. So each 1 in the input is converted into a 2 in the output, but the positions of the 2s are determined in a certain way.\n\nNow, how are the positions determined? Let's see.\n\nLooking at Example0: input's 1 is at (row 2, column 1). Output's 2 is at (row 1, column 1). So moved up one row.\n\nExample1: input 1s at (1,2) and (2,1). Output 2s at (1,1) and (1,2). So the (2,1) moves up to (1,1), and the (1,2) stays in (1,2)? No, but in output they are [2,2,0], so positions (0,0) and (0,1) if 0-based. Wait, perhaps in the output, the 2s are placed in the highest possible row for their respective columns, based on the input 1s.\n\nWait, maybe for each column in the input, if there's a 1 in any row of that column, then the output's highest row (i.e., earliest row) in that column becomes 2. For example:\n\nIn Example0, the input has a 1 in column 1, row 2. The highest row for column1 is row1. So output's row1, column1 is 2.\n\nIn Example1, column2 has a 1 in row1 (highest), column1 has a 1 in row2. So output column1's highest is row1 (since the input 1 is in row2, but maybe the highest row that's above the 1?), wait, this is getting confusing.\n\nAlternatively, for each 1 in the input, the output places a 2 in the same column but in the first row (row 0 if 0-based). Let's check:\n\nExample0: 1 is in row1 (0-based) column0. Output's row0, column0 becomes 2. Correct.\n\nExample1: input has 1s in row0 column1 and row1 column0. Output row0 column0 and column1 are 2. So that's the same as for each 1, take their column and put a 2 in row0 of that column. So if multiple 1s are in the same column, they all contribute to the same 2 in row0. But wait, Example2: input has 1s in row0 column2 and row2 column0. So in output, row0 column0 and column2 would be 2. But the output is [2,2,0]. So row0 columns0 and 1. Hmm, that's not matching. Because the input's column0 (row2) would contribute to row0 column0. Column2 (row0) would contribute to row0 column2. But output is [2,2,0]. So that's not matching.\n\nSo maybe that's not the case.\n\nAlternative approach: Let's look at the positions of the 2s in the output and see if they form some pattern relative to the input 1s.\n\nExample0: input 1 is at (row1, column0). Output 2 is (row0, column0). So directly above.\n\nExample1: input 1s at (row0, column1) and (row1, column0). Output 2s at (row0, columns0 and 1). So for the 1 at (row0, column1), the 2 is in same row and column. For the 1 at (row1, column0), the 2 is at (row0, column0). So combining both: the 2s are in the same column but higher rows, possibly the highest possible.\n\nWait, that's possible. For each 1 in the input, in the output, we place a 2 in the same column but in the highest possible row (i.e., the earliest row) that is above or same as the 1's row. Wait, but if the 1 is in row0, then highest possible is row0. So the 2 is in same position. For a 1 in row1, highest possible is row0. For row2, highest possible is row0? That doesn't fit with Example2. Let's check.\n\nExample2: input 1s at (row0, column2) and (row2, column0). So according to this idea, the 2s would be in (row0, column2) and (row0, column0). So output first row would be [2,0,2]. But the actual output is [2,2,0]. Hmm, so that's not matching.\n\nWait, perhaps the 2s are placed in the first row (row0) of the column, regardless of where the 1 is. So for any 1 in a column, the first row of that column becomes 2. But then in Example2, column0 has a 1 in row2, so first row column0 becomes 2. Column2 has a 1 in row0, so column2 becomes 2. But the output is [2,2,0]. Wait, that's columns0 and 1. So that doesn't fit. So maybe not.\n\nAnother angle: Maybe the output is combining the columns of all the 1s. For example, each 1 in the input contributes to a 2 in the output's first row, but not exactly in the same column. For instance, perhaps the sum of columns, but that's unclear.\n\nLet's think about Example3. Input is:\n\n[0,1,0]\n\n[0,0,1]\n\n[0,0,0]\n\nSo 1s at (0,1) and (1,2). Output is [2,2,0]. So the columns of the input 1s are 1 and 2, but in output, columns0 and 1 are 2. Hmm. That doesn't align.\n\nMaybe the output is a count of the number of 1s in each column, but capped at 2. Let's see:\n\nExample0: column0 has 1, others 0. So output column0 is 2. Example1: column0 and 1 have 1 each. Output columns0 and 1 are 2. That fits. Example2: column0 and 2 have 1 each. Output columns0 and 1 are 2. So that doesn't fit. So maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's a combination of rows and columns. For example, the output's first row has 2s for each column where there's a 1 in any row, but shifted left. Like, column0's 1 would cause a 2 in column0, column1's 1 causes 2 in column1, but in Example2, why columns0 and1 have 2s? The input 1s are in column0 and 2.\n\nWait, maybe there's a different rule. Let's look at the output rows. In most examples, the output has 2s in the first row. Starting from Example7, the output also has 2s in the second row. So maybe the number of rows in the output with 2s depends on the input's structure. Let's check Example7's input:\n\n[1,1,0]\n\n[0,0,0]\n\n[1,0,1]\n\nOutput:\n\n[2,2,2]\n\n[0,2,0]\n\n[0,0,0]\n\nSo input has four 1s. Output has three 2s in first row, one in second. So total four 2s.\n\nBut how are their positions determined? The 2s in the first row are columns0,1,2. The second row has column1. So perhaps the 1s in the input are transformed into 2s in the same row as the 1, but shifted left? Or some other direction.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output's 2s are placed in the positions that are connected via some adjacency. For example, each 1 in the input starts a spread of 2s upwards and to the left and right. But I need to find a rule that fits all examples.\n\nWait, let's try to model it as a BFS. Each 1 in the input is a source that spreads 2s to certain cells. Let's see:\n\nIn Example0, the 1 is at (1,0). It spreads to (0,0) as a 2.\n\nIn Example1, the two 1s: (0,1) and (1,0). The first 1 can spread to (0,0) and (0,1), but the output has (0,0) and (0,1) as 2s. Wait, but the first 1 is already at (0,1). So maybe each 1 can spread upwards, to the left, and to the right in the same row? Not sure.\n\nExample5's input is:\n\n[1,1,0]\n\n[0,0,0]\n\n[1,0,0]\n\nOutput's first row is all 2s. The input has three 1s. So maybe the 1s in row0 columns0 and 1 spread to cover the entire row0. The third row's 1 (column0) spreads to row0, column0. So the output row0 has three 2s. How?\n\nAlternatively, the output's row0 is the union of the columns where any 1 exists in any row. So, for example, if there's a 1 in any row in column0, then row0 column0 is 2. If there's a 1 in any row in column1, then row0 column1 is 2, etc. Let's test this:\n\nExample0: 1 in column0. Output row0 column0 is 2. Correct.\n\nExample1: 1 in column0 (row1) and column1 (row0). So row0 columns0 and1 are 2. Output is correct.\n\nExample2: 1 in column0 (row2) and column2 (row0). So row0 columns0 and2 should be 2. But output is [2,2,0]. So that doesn't fit. Therefore, this theory is incorrect.\n\nHmm. Let's think differently. Maybe each 1 in the input turns into a 2 in the cell immediately above it. If there's a cell above. If the 1 is in the top row, then it stays there. Then, for each 1, the cell above becomes 2, and the 1 is replaced by 0. Let's check.\n\nExample0: input 1 in row1, column0. Output 2 in row0, column0. So yes.\n\nExample1: input has 1s in row0, column1 and row1, column0. The row0 1 would turn into row0 column1's 2 (since no row above), and row1's 1 would turn into row0 column0's 2. So output row0 has 2s in columns0 and1. Which matches.\n\nExample2: input 1s in row0 column2 and row2 column0. The row0 1 would stay as 2 in row0 column2, and row2 column0's 1 would turn into row1 column0's 2, and then row0 column0's 2? Wait, but that depends on how the movement happens. If each 1 moves up once. So row2 column0 moves to row1 column0, and row1 column0 would move to row0 column0. So in example2, the input's row2 column0 1 would first move to row1 column0, then that would move to row0 column0. But the output is [2,2,0]. So in row0, columns0 and1. How does that happen?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 1s are moved up as far as possible, and each step up generates a 2. But maybe multiple steps. For example, a 1 in row2 column0 would generate 2s in row1 and row0? But that's not supported by the examples. Example0's output has only one 2, so probably not.\n\nAlternatively, each 1 is moved up to the topmost possible row (row0), and that's where the 2 is placed. So regardless of where the 1 is in the input, the 2 is placed in row0 of the same column. So:\n\nExample0: row1 column0 \u2192 row0 column0 2. Correct.\n\nExample1: row0 column1 \u2192 row0 column1 2. row1 column0 \u2192 row0 column0 2. So output row0 has 2s in columns0 and1. Correct.\n\nExample2: row0 column2 \u2192 row0 column2 2. row2 column0 \u2192 row0 column0 2. So output row0 should be [2,0,2]. But the actual output is [2,2,0]. So this doesn't fit. Hence, this theory is invalid.\n\nHmm. What's different about Example2's output? The input has a 1 in row0 column2 and row2 column0. But output is [2,2,0]. So columns0 and1. Why?\n\nLooking back at the output examples, perhaps there's a directional component. For example, each 1 in the input affects the cells to the left of its column in the first row.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nIn Example0, the 1 is in column0. Output is column0. So leftmost. Example1 has 1s in column0 and1. Output columns0 and1. Example2 has 1s in column0 and2. Output columns0 and1. Hmm, so perhaps in that case, the rightmost 1 (column2) affects column1 in the first row. That's odd.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are placed in the first row, starting from the left, for each 1 in the input. For example, each 1 adds a 2 to the leftmost available spot in the first row. Let's see:\n\nExample0: one 1. So first available spot in first row is column0 \u2192 2 there.\n\nExample1: two 1s. So columns0 and1.\n\nExample2: two 1s. So columns0 and1, even though the input's columns are 0 and2. So why are they columns0 and1? That suggests that the order of the 1s in the input affects the output's placement. But how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's counting the number of 1s in each column and then, in the first row, filling 2s from left to right up to the number of 1s. For example, if there are two 1s in any columns, the first two columns in the first row are 2s. But Example2 has two 1s, so output's first two columns are 2s. Example0 has one, first column. Example5 has three 1s, so first three columns (but there are three columns) so all are 2s. Example7 has four 1s, so first four columns would be filled, but since the first row has three columns, then the fourth 2 would go to the next row. Let's check Example7's output: first row is [2,2,2], second row [0,2,0]. So three 2s in first row, one in second. That's four total. So the first three 1s fill the first row, and the fourth 1's 2 is placed in the second row's column1. But how is this determined?\n\nAlternatively, the 2s are filled row-wise, left to right, top to bottom, one per each 1 in the input. So for each 1 in the input, a 2 is placed in the next available cell. Available cells are scanned left to right, top to bottom. So:\n\nExample0: one 1. First cell (0,0) becomes 2.\n\nExample1: two 1s. (0,0) and (0,1) become 2s.\n\nExample2: two 1s. (0,0) and (0,1) become 2s, even though the input's columns are 0 and 2. So the 2s are filled left to right regardless of the input's column positions.\n\nThis seems to fit. Let's test with Example2. Input has 1s in columns0 and 2. But output fills the first two positions in the first row. So regardless of the original columns, the 2s are placed in the first row, left to right, one per input 1. So:\n\nIn Example2, two 1s \u2192 two 2s in first two columns.\n\nIn Example5, three 1s \u2192 three 2s in first three columns.\n\nIn Example7, four 1s \u2192 first three columns in row0, then the fourth in row1 column1.\n\nYes, Example7's output has four 2s, with the fourth being in row1 column1.\n\nSimilarly, Example8's input has four 1s. Output's first row is three 2s, then the fourth in row1 column1.\n\nExample9's input has four 1s. Output has three 2s in first row and one in row1 column1.\n\nSo this seems to fit. So the pattern is: For each 1 in the input (regardless of their position), in the output, place a 2 in the next available cell, going row-wise from left to right, top to bottom. The available cells are processed in order (row0 left to right, then row1 left to right, etc.), and each 1 contributes one 2, placed in the next available cell.\n\nBut let's verify this with all examples.\n\nExample0: one 1 \u2192 first cell (0,0) \u2192 [2,0,0]. Correct.\n\nExample1: two 1s \u2192 (0,0) and (0,1) \u2192 [2,2,0]. Correct.\n\nExample2: two 1s \u2192 (0,0) and (0,1). Output [2,2,0]. Correct.\n\nExample3: two 1s \u2192 same as above. Output [2,2,0]. Correct.\n\nExample4: one 1 \u2192 (0,0). Output [2,0,0]. Correct.\n\nExample5: three 1s \u2192 (0,0), (0,1), (0,2). Output first row all 2s. Correct.\n\nExample6: three 1s? Let's check Example6's input:\n\n[0,1,0]\n\n[1,1,0]\n\n[0,0,0]\n\nSo three 1s. Output first row all 2s. Correct.\n\nExample7: four 1s \u2192 three in first row, fourth in second row, column1. Output [2,2,2] in first row, [0,2,0] in second. Correct.\n\nExample8: input four 1s \u2192 same as Example7's output structure.\n\nExample9: four 1s \u2192 same.\n\nSo this pattern seems to fit all training examples.\n\nThus, the rule is: The output is generated by placing a 2 in each cell, starting from the top-left, moving left to right, row by row, for each 1 present in the input. Each 1 contributes one 2, placed in the next available cell in this order.\n\nSo for the test input:\n\nTest Input:\n[0, 1, 0]\n[0, 1, 1]\n[1, 0, 0]\n\nLet's count the number of 1s. First row has one (column1), second row has two (columns1 and2), third row has one (column0). Total 1+2+1=4 1s. So the output should have four 2s placed in order: (0,0), (0,1), (0,2), (1,0).\n\nBut wait, let's list the order:\n\nThe cells are processed as:\n\nRow0: 0,0 \u2192 0,1 \u2192 0,2\n\nRow1: 1,0 \u2192 1,1 \u2192 1,2\n\nRow2: 2,0 \u2192 2,1 \u2192 2,2\n\nSo for four 1s, the first four cells in order would be:\n\n(0,0), (0,1), (0,2), (1,0).\n\nSo the output would be:\n\nRow0: [2,2,2]\n\nRow1: [2,0,0]\n\nRow2: [0,0,0]\n\nBut wait, looking at Example7's output, which has four 1s, the fourth 2 is placed in (1,1). Wait, this contradicts the previous assumption. Because in Example7's input, four 1s:\n\nInput:\n\n[1,1,0]\n\n[0,0,0]\n\n[1,0,1]\n\nSo four 1s. The output's first row has three 2s (0,0), (0,1), (0,2), and the fourth 2 is in (1,1). But according to the order I thought of, the fourth should be (1,0). But in Example7's output, it's (1,1). So my previous theory must be incorrect.\n\nWait, what's the order in Example7's output? The output is:\n\n[2,2,2]\n\n[0,2,0]\n\n[0,0,0]\n\nSo four 2s: three in row0, one in row1, column1. So the order must not be strictly row-wise left to right.\n\nHmm. This complicates things. So why is the fourth 2 in Example7 in row1, column1 instead of row1, column0?\n\nLooking at Example7's input:\n\nThe 1s are at (0,0), (0,1), (2,0), (2,2). So four 1s.\n\nIf the output is generated by processing the input 1s in some order (like row-major), then the 2s would be placed in the same order as the 1s are processed.\n\nMaybe the input 1s are processed in row-major order (left to right, top to bottom), and each 1 contributes a 2 in the next available cell in the output, following row-major order.\n\nSo for Example7's input, the 1s are at positions (0,0), (0,1), (2,0), (2,2). When processed in row-major order, they are encountered as:\n\nRow0: (0,0), (0,1)\n\nRow2: (2,0), (2,2)\n\nSo the output's 2s would be placed in row-major order:\n\nFirst two 1s \u2192 output (0,0), (0,1). Third 1 (row2, column0) \u2192 next available cell is (0,2). Fourth 1 (row2, column2) \u2192 next available cell is (1,0). But Example7's output has (0,0), (0,1), (0,2) in first row, and (1,1) in second row. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 2s are placed in the output in the same order as the 1s are encountered in the input's row-major order. So each 1's 2 is placed in the next cell of the output in row-major order, regardless of the 1's position.\n\nFor example:\n\nEach 1 in the input, when processed in row-major order, leads to a 2 in the corresponding output cell in row-major order.\n\nWait, let's test this with Example7's input.\n\nInput rows:\n\nRow0: [1,1,0]\n\nRow1: [0,0,0]\n\nRow2: [1,0,1]\n\nRow-major order of 1s:\n\nRow0: (0,0), (0,1)\n\nRow2: (2,0), (2,2)\n\nSo four 1s.\n\nThe output's 2s would be placed in the first four cells of the output in row-major order. So:\n\nOutput cells:\n\nRow0: 0,0 \u2192 2\n\nRow0:0,1 \u21922\n\nRow0:0,2 \u21922\n\nRow1:1,0 \u21922\n\nBut Example7's output has row0: three 2s and row1: (1,1) as 2. So that doesn't match.\n\nHmm. This is getting really tricky. Let's think of another approach.\n\nLooking at the output grids, it seems like the 2s are forming a kind of \"fill\" from left to right, top to bottom. The number of 2s equals the number of 1s. But their positions don't directly correlate to the input 1s' positions. It's more like they're filled in order, regardless of where the 1s are.\n\nIn Example7's input, there are four 1s. The output has three in the first row and one in the second row's middle column. Why is the fourth 2 in (1,1)?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is filled in a way that the 2s are placed in the same positions as the 1s in the input, but merged upwards. Like, if there's a 1 in a lower row, it moves up as much as possible, avoiding overlapping with other 2s.\n\nBut how would that work for Example7?\n\nExample7's input has 1s at (0,0), (0,1), (2,0), (2,2). The output has 2s at (0,0), (0,1), (0,2), (1,1). So (2,0) moves up to (0,2) (since (0,0) and (0,1) are already taken?), and (2,2) moves up to (1,1)? That seems arbitrary.\n\nAlternatively, each 1 in the input is processed in some order, and when moving up, if the spot is already taken, it moves to the next available position.\n\nBut this is getting too vague. Maybe there's another pattern. Let's look at Example7's input and output again.\n\nInput:\n\nRow0: 1,1,0\n\nRow1: 0,0,0\n\nRow2:1,0,1\n\nOutput:\n\nRow0: 2,2,2\n\nRow1:0,2,0\n\nRow2:0,0,0\n\nSo four 2s. How are they positioned?\n\nThe first three are in row0. The fourth is in row1, column1.\n\nMaybe the output is filled row-wise, left to right, and for each 1 in the input, a 2 is placed in the first available spot in the output grid, scanning row by row, left to right, top to bottom. But the order in which the input's 1s are processed affects this.\n\nIf the input's 1s are processed in row-major order, then for each 1, you place a 2 in the earliest available cell (leftmost available in the first row, then second, etc.).\n\nLet's see Example7's input: the 1s are at (0,0), (0,1), (2,0), (2,2) when processed in row-major order.\n\nProcessing first 1: place 2 in (0,0).\n\nSecond 1: (0,1) \u2192 (0,1).\n\nThird 1: (2,0) \u2192 next available spot is (0,2).\n\nFourth 1: (2,2) \u2192 next available is (1,0). But the output's fourth 2 is in (1,1). So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is filled in a different order. Like column-wise.\n\nAlternatively, the output's 2s are placed in the order of the input's columns. For example, for each column, if there's a 1 in any row, place a 2 in the first available row of that column.\n\nBut this doesn't fit Example2.\n\nAlternatively, the output's 2s are placed in the same row and column as the input's 1s, but merged upwards. For example, each 1 in a column moves up as far as possible. If there's a 1 below, they stack upwards. For example:\n\nIn Example7, column0 has 1s in row0 and row2. The highest possible row for column0 is row0. So 2 is placed there. Column1 has a 1 in row0. So 2 there. Column2 has a 1 in row0 (from input's row0, column2? No, input's row0, column2 is 0. Wait input's row2, column2 is 1. So column2 has a 1 in row2. So highest possible row is row0. So 2 in row0, column2. But the output's row0, column2 is 2. Then the fourth 1 is in row2, column0. But in column0, row0 already has a 2. So perhaps the fourth 1 in row2, column0 would be placed in row1, column0. But in Example7's output, row1, column0 is 0. So that's not the case.\n\nThis is really challenging. Let me try to find another approach.\n\nLooking at the examples, perhaps the output is the sum of all possible cells that are to the north (including current cell), west, east, and south of each 1 in the input. But this seems complicated.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is a reflection or rotation of the input. But Example0's input has a 1 in row1, column0. Output has a 2 in row0, column0. So it's shifted up. But other examples show more complex transformations.\n\nAnother idea: Perhaps the output's 2s are formed by the union of all cells that are in the same row or column as any 1 in the input, but only in the first occurrence. For example, any row or column containing a 1 gets a 2 in the first row of that column.\n\nBut Example0's input has a 1 in row1, column0. So column0 gets a 2 in row0.\n\nExample1 has 1s in row0 and row1. Columns0 and1. So columns0 and1 get 2s in row0.\n\nExample2 has 1s in row0 and row2. Columns0 and2. So columns0 and2 get 2s in row0. But the output is [2,2,0]. So this theory is incorrect.\n\nAnother angle: Maybe the output's 2s are the cells that are \"dominated\" by the input 1s. For example, a cell in the output is 2 if there exists a 1 in the input that is either in the same column and a lower row or in the same row and to the right. But this is vague.\n\nAlternatively, the output's 2s are the cells that are to the left and above each 1 in the input. For instance, for each 1 at (r,c), mark all cells (r', c') where r' \u2264 r and c' \u2264 c. Then, in the output, each such cell becomes a 2. Let's test this.\n\nExample0: 1 at (1,0). Cells to the left and above: (0,0), (1,0). But output has only (0,0). So maybe not.\n\nExample1: 1s at (0,1) and (1,0). For (0,1), cells to the left and above: (0,0), (0,1). For (1,0): (0,0), (1,0). So union of these cells is (0,0), (0,1), (1,0). Output is (0,0), (0,1). So doesn't match.\n\nAnother approach: Maybe the output is the maximum row for each column where a 1 exists. For example, for each column, the highest row (smallest row index) where a 1 exists in that column, then set that cell in the output to 2. Then, any cells below in that column are 0.\n\nWait, let's check:\n\nExample0: column0 has a 1 in row1. The highest row is row1. So output row1, column0 would be 2. But the output is row0, column0. So no.\n\nExample1: column0 has 1 in row1, column1 has 1 in row0. Highest rows are row1 for column0 (since row1 is lower than row0), and row0 for column1. So output would have 2s in row1, column0 and row0, column1. But the output is row0 columns0 and1. So this doesn't fit.\n\nMaybe it's the lowest row for each column. For example, column0's lowest 1 is row2 in Example2. But output for Example2 is row0 columns0 and1. Doesn't fit.\n\nThis is really tough. Let's think back to the original examples and see if there's a different pattern. For instance, the output's 2s seem to form a shape that's based on the positions of the 1s, but it's not clear how. However, the number of 2s equals the number of 1s, so each 1 converts to a 2 in a specific position. The positions are determined by filling the output grid row by row, left to right, with each 1 contributing a 2 in the next available cell.\n\nSo, in the test input:\n\nTest Input:\n\nRow0: [0,1,0]\n\nRow1: [0,1,1]\n\nRow2: [1,0,0]\n\nNumber of 1s: Row0 has 1, row1 has 2, row2 has 1. Total 4.\n\nSo the output should have four 2s filled in row-major order.\n\nRow0: cells (0,0), (0,1), (0,2)\n\nRow1: (1,0), (1,1), etc.\n\nSo first four 2s would be in (0,0), (0,1), (0,2), (1,0).\n\nSo the output should be:\n\nRow0: [2,2,2]\n\nRow1: [2,0,0]\n\nRow2: [0,0,0]\n\nBut looking at Example7's output, which has four 1s, the output is:\n\n[2,2,2]\n\n[0,2,0]\n\n[0,0,0]\n\nSo fourth 2 is in (1,1) instead of (1,0). So this contradicts the row-major fill theory.\n\nWait, in Example7's input, there are four 1s. According to row-major fill, the fourth 2 should be in (1,0). But the output has it in (1,1). So that's a problem.\n\nAnother observation: in Example7's input, the 1s are in columns 0, 1, 0, and 2 (rows 0,0,2,2). The output's fourth 2 is in column1 of row1. So perhaps there's a different priority for filling.\n\nAlternatively, the 2s are filled column-wise. For example, fill each column top to bottom, left to right. So for each 1, the next available cell is in the earliest column with available space.\n\nExample7's output has three columns filled in row0, then column1 of row1. So four 2s: three in column0, column1, column2 of row0, then column1 of row1. So that's not column-wise.\n\nAlternatively, the 2s are placed in the same order as the input's 1s are processed, but processed in some other order. For example, sorted by row then column.\n\nBut this seems too vague.\n\nAlternatively, the output's 2s are placed in the positions that are the sum of the input 1s' rows and columns modulo something, but I'm not sure.\n\nAt this point, given the time I've spent and the deadline, I think the most consistent pattern is that each 1 in the input becomes a 2 in the next available cell in row-major order. But there's inconsistency with Example7. However, perhaps the input 1s are processed in a different order. For example, perhaps the 1s are processed from the bottom row to the top, left to right. So for Example7's input:\n\nThe 1s are in row2 columns0 and 2, then row0 columns0 and 1. Processing from bottom to top:\n\nRow2: (2,0), (2,2)\n\nRow0: (0,0), (0,1)\n\nProcessing these 1s would fill the output as follows:\n\nFirst (2,0): next available cell is (0,0).\n\nSecond (2,2): next available cell (0,1).\n\nThird (0,0): next available cell (0,2).\n\nFourth (0,1): next available cell (1,0). \n\nBut Example7's output has (0,0), (0,1), (0,2), (1,1). So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 1s are processed from left to right, top to bottom, but the output's cells are filled in a different order. Like right to left, top to bottom.\n\nAlternatively, the output's 2s are placed in the same position as the input 1s, but merged upwards and to the left as much as possible. For example, each 1 moves up as far as possible, then left as far as possible.\n\nFor Example7:\n\n1 at (2,0) moves up to (0,0).\n\n1 at (2,2) moves up to (0,2).\n\n1 at (0,0) is already in (0,0).\n\n1 at (0,1) is in (0,1).\n\nSo output would have 2s at (0,0), (0,1), (0,2). Then, where is the fourth 2? Maybe (0,0) is already filled, so next available is (0,1), but already filled, then (0,2), filled. Then (1,0), but that's not filled in Example7's output. So this doesn't explain.\n\nAt this point, I think the only way to resolve this is to consider that the output is generated by placing a 2 for each 1 in the input, filling the first row left to right, then the second row left to right, etc. The number of 2s equals the number of 1s. For the test input with four 1s, the first three are in the first row, and the fourth is in the second row's first column.\n\nBut Example7's output has the fourth 2 in the second row's middle column, which contradicts. However, maybe there's a different rule when multiple 1s are in the same column. For example, when a column has multiple 1s, the 2s are stacked in the output's rows for that column.\n\nBut Example7's input has two 1s in column0 (row0 and row2), but the output's column0 has only one 2 in row0. So that's not stacking.\n\nGiven the time I've invested and the examples, I'll proceed with the theory that the output is filled row-major, with each 1 contributing a 2 in the next available cell, regardless of the input's positions.\n\nThus, for the test input with four 1s, the output would be:\n\nFirst three 2s in row0: [2,2,2]\n\nFourth 2 in row1, column0: [2,0,0]\n\nRow2 remains zeros.\n\nBut Example7's output has the fourth 2 in row1, column1, which contradicts this. However, perhaps there's a different processing order. Maybe the 1s are processed from bottom to top, row by row, left to right. Let's see:\n\nTest input:\n\nRow0: 0,1,0 \u2192 one 1 at (0,1)\n\nRow1:0,1,1 \u2192 two 1s at (1,1), (1,2)\n\nRow2:1,0,0 \u2192 one 1 at (2,0)\n\nProcessing order bottom to top, left to right:\n\nRow2, column0 \u2192 2 at (0,0)\n\nRow1, column1 \u2192 2 at (0,1)\n\nRow1, column2 \u2192 2 at (0,2)\n\nRow0, column1 \u2192 2 at (1,0)\n\nSo output row0: [2,2,2]\n\nRow1: [2,0,0]\n\nRow2: zeros.\n\nBut this would match the row-major fill theory.\n\nBut Example7's input, processed this way:\n\nRow2: columns0 and 2 \u2192 2s placed first at (0,0) and (0,1)\n\nRow0: columns0 and1 \u2192 next 2s at (0,2) and (1,0)\n\nSo output row0: [2,2,2], row1: [2,0,0]\n\nBut the actual Example7's output is row1: [0,2,0]. So this still doesn't fit.\n\nThis indicates that the processing order might be different. Perhaps the 1s are processed from right to left, bottom to top.\n\nBut this is getting too time-consuming. Given the examples, the best guess is that the output's 2s are filled row-wise, left to right, top to bottom, with each 1 contributing a 2 in the next available cell.\n\nApplying this to the test input:\n\nNumber of 1s:4.\n\nFirst three 2s in row0: [2,2,2]\n\nFourth 2 in row1, column0: [2,0,0]\n\nSo output:\n\n[2,2,2]\n\n[2,0,0]\n\n[0,0,0]\n\nBut in Example7, with four 1s, the fourth 2 is in row1, column1, which contradicts this. However, maybe in that case, the fourth 2 is placed in the next available cell after the first three in row0, which would be row1, column0. But in the actual example, it's row1, column1. So this suggests that the theory is incorrect.\n\nAnother possibility is that the output's 2s are placed in the same positions as the input's 1s, but shifted up by one row. If there's a 1 in row r, column c, then the output's row r-1, column c is 2. If multiple 1s are in the same column, then the highest 2 is placed in the earliest possible row.\n\nFor example:\n\nExample7's input has 1s in row0, column0 and1; row2, column0 and2.\n\nShifting up:\n\nRow0's 1s can't shift up further, so 2s are in row0, columns0 and1.\n\nRow2's 1s shift up to row1, columns0 and2.\n\nSo output would have row0: [2,2,0], row1: [2,0,2]. But Example7's output is row0: [2,2,2], row1: [0,2,0]. Doesn't fit.\n\nThis is getting frustrating. Given the time, I think I have to make a best guess based on the majority of examples.\n\nMost examples have the 2s in the first row, left to right. When there are more 1s than the first row can hold, the next row starts. For Example7, perhaps the 2s are filled in a way that after filling the first row, the next 2 is placed in the second row's middle column.\n\nBut why? There's no clear pattern.\n\nAlternatively, after filling the first row, the next 2s are placed in the second row, left to right. So for four 1s:\n\n[2,2,2]\n\n[2,0,0]\n\nBut Example7's output is [2,2,2] in row0 and [0,2,0] in row1. So the fourth 2 is in column1 of row1. Which is not left to right.\n\nPerhaps the output's 2s are placed in a diagonal manner after the first row. For example, after the first row, they go to the diagonal in the next row.\n\nBut this is speculation.\n\nGiven the time constraints, I'll proceed with the row-major fill theory, even though it doesn't fit all examples.\n\nTest input has four 1s. So output:\n\n[2,2,2]\n\n[2,0,0]\n\n[0,0,0]\n\nBut looking back at Example6's input:\n\n[0,1,0]\n\n[1,1,0]\n\n[0,0,0]\n\nInput has three 1s. Output has three 2s in first row. Which fits the theory.\n\nExample7's input has four 1s. According to the theory, output would be:\n\n[2,2,2]\n\n[2,0,0]\n\nBut the actual output is:\n\n[2,2,2]\n\n[0,2,0]\n\nSo, there's a discrepancy. But perhaps the 2s are placed in a different order when the first row is filled. Maybe after row0 is filled, the next 2s are placed in row1, column1, then row1, column0, etc. But this is arbitrary.\n\nAlternatively, the 2s are placed in the order of the input's columns, from left to right, regardless of the rows. For each column, if there's a 1 in that column, place a 2 in the first available row of that column.\n\nFor example:\n\nIn the test input, columns with 1s:\n\nColumn0: row2\n\nColumn1: row0, row1\n\nColumn2: row1\n\nSo columns0,1,2.\n\nFor each column left to right:\n\nColumn0: first available row is row0. Place 2.\n\nColumn1: first available row is row0. Place 2.\n\nColumn2: first available row is row0. Place 2.\n\nThen, any remaining 1s (total 4) would be placed in column1's next available row (row1), and column0's next available row (row1), but this is unclear.\n\nThis would result in:\n\nRow0: [2,2,2]\n\nRow1: [2,2,0]\n\nBut test input has four 1s, so fourth 2 would be in row1, column0. But this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output's 2s are placed in the first row for each column that contains a 1, and any excess 1s are placed in the second row, column1.\n\nBut this is not based on any particular logic.\n\nGiven that I'm stuck, I'll proceed with the initial theory and see if it fits the test case.\n\nTest Input's 1s are at (0,1), (1,1), (1,2), (2,0). Four 1s. Filled in row-major order:\n\nFirst 1 \u2192 (0,0) 2\n\nSecond 1 \u2192 (0,1) 2\n\nThird 1 \u2192 (0,2) 2\n\nFourth 1 \u2192 (1,0) 2\n\nSo output:\n\n[2,2,2]\n\n[2,0,0]\n\n[0,0,0]\n\nBut none of the training examples have a 2 in row1, column0 except Example8's output. Let's check Example8's input and output.\n\nExample8's input:\n\n[0,1,0]\n\n[1,1,0]\n\n[1,0,0]\n\nOutput:\n\n[2,2,2]\n\n[0,2,0]\n\n[0,0,0]\n\nNumber of 1s: four (row0:1, row1:2, row2:1).\n\nAccording to row-major fill, the 2s should be in row0: three, row1: one. But the output has row0: three, row1: one in column1. So this contradicts the initial theory.\n\nSo perhaps the correct pattern is that after filling the first row, the next 2 is placed in the middle column of the next row.\n\nAlternatively, the 2s are filled in a way that after the first row is full, the next 2s are placed in the middle of the following rows. For four 1s: three in first row, one in second row's middle.\n\nThat would fit Example7 and Example8. Let's see:\n\nExample7's output: four 2s, three in first row, one in second row's middle.\n\nExample8's output: same structure.\n\nExample9's output: four 2s, three in first row, one in second row's middle.\n\nTest input has four 1s. So according to this, the output would be:\n\n[2,2,2]\n\n[0,2,0]\n\n[0,0,0]\n\nWhich matches the structure seen in Examples7-9.\n\nYes, this makes sense. So the pattern is: For each 1 in the input, the output is a grid where the first row is filled with 2s left to right until there are no more 1s or the row is filled. Any remaining 1s are placed in the center of subsequent rows.\n\nSo for the test input with four 1s:\n\nFirst three 1s fill the first row: [2,2,2]\n\nThe fourth 1 is placed in the center of the second row: [0,2,0]\n\nThus, the output would be:\n\n[2,2,2]\n\n[0,2,0]\n\n[0,0,0]\n\nThis matches Examples7-9.",

        "cot_2": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. So, looking at the training examples, the input is a 3x3 grid of 0s and 1s, and the output is another 3x3 grid where some of those 0s have turned into 2s. My job is to figure out how the input is transformed into the output.\n\nLet me start by looking at the first few examples. Example 0 has a single 1 in the second row first column. The output has a 2 in the first row first column. Hmm, maybe there's a movement or direction involved here. Like, the 1s in the input are causing 2s to appear in certain positions relative to them.\n\nLooking at Example 1: Input is first row has a 1 in the middle, second row first column has a 1. The output has two 2s in the first row. So perhaps each 1 in the input affects the cells above or around it. But how?\n\nWait, in Example 0, the input's 1 is at (2,1) (assuming rows are 1-based). The output's 2 is at (1,1). So maybe each 1 in the input causes the cell above it to become a 2. Let's check Example 1. The first 1 is at (1,2) in the input. The output's first row has (2,2,0). So if the 1 is in (1,2), the cell above would be... but there's no row above row 1. Wait, maybe it's the cell to the left? Or maybe it's a different direction.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each 1 in the input propagates a 2 upwards, but when there's another 1 in the same column, they combine. Let's check Example 2. Input has 0,0,1 in first row and 1,0,0 in third row. Output is first row 2,2,0. So if the 1 in the first row third column (1,3) and third row first column (3,1), how do they affect the output? The output's first row has 2s in positions 1 and 2. Maybe each 1 affects cells to the left or right?\n\nWait, maybe it's a matter of the number of 1s in each column. Let's see. In Example 0, the input has one 1 in column 1. The output has a 2 in column 1 of the first row. Example 1 has two 1s: one in column 2 (row 1) and column 1 (row 2). The output has two 2s in the first row columns 1 and 2. Example 2: two 1s in column 3 (row 1) and column 1 (row 3). Output has 2s in columns 1 and 2 of row 1. Hmm, maybe the number of 2s in the first row depends on the columns where the 1s are in the input. For each 1 in column c, the first row's columns from 1 to c are set to 2?\n\nWait, in Example 0, the 1 is in column 1. The output's first row has a 2 in column 1. Example 1: 1 in column 2 (row 1) and column 1 (row 2). Output first row columns 1 and 2 are 2. So maybe each 1 in column c causes the first row's columns up to c to be 2. So if a column has a 1, then all columns to the left in the first row become 2.\n\nWait, but Example 2 has 1s in column 3 and column 1. So according to that logic, the first row should have columns 1-3 (from the column 3 1) and columns 1 (from column 1 1). But the output is [2,2,0], which covers columns 1 and 2. So that doesn't fit. Alternatively, maybe the maximum column index of all 1s determines how many columns in the first row are 2s. Like, the maximum c of any 1 in the input, then columns 1 to c in the first row are 2. But in Example 2, the max c is 3 (from the 1 in row 1, column 3), but the output's first row is [2,2,0]. So that's not matching. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 2s in the output's first row are determined by the number of 1s in each column. For each column, if there's at least one 1 in that column, then the first row's corresponding column becomes 2. Wait, Example 0: column 1 has a 1, so first row column 1 is 2. Others are 0. That works. Example 1: columns 1 and 2 have 1s, so first row columns 1 and 2 are 2. That fits. Example 2: columns 1 and 3 have 1s. So first row columns 1 and 3 would be 2. But output is [2,2,0]. That doesn't match. So that's not right.\n\nWait, let's look at Example 2's input again. Input is:\n\nRow 1: [0,0,1]\n\nRow 3: [1,0,0]\n\nSo columns 1 and 3 have 1s. But output is [2,2,0] in the first row. So columns 1 and 2 are 2. Hmm. So that doesn't fit the column idea.\n\nMaybe the direction is different. Maybe each 1 in the input affects the cells to the left in the same row. Let's see. For example, in Example 0, the 1 is in row 2, column 1. If it affects the cell above (row 1, column 1), then that becomes 2. That matches. Example 1: 1 in row 1, column 2. If it affects cells above (but there's no row 0), so maybe it affects the same row, but to the left. Or maybe the row above. Wait, row 1's 1 in column 2: if the output's first row is row 1, then maybe the 1 in row 1, column 2 affects the cells to the left in its own row. So column 1 and 2 in row 1 become 2. That would match Example 1's output. Similarly, the 1 in row 2, column 1 would affect row 1, column 1. So combining both, row 1 columns 1 and 2 are 2. That's the output. That makes sense.\n\nWait, this seems possible. Let's think. The rule could be: for each 1 in the input grid, in the output grid, set all cells to the left (same row) and the cell above (previous row, same column) to 2. But how does that work when multiple 1s are present?\n\nTake Example 2: input has 1 in row 1, column 3, and row 3, column 1. Let's process each 1. For row 1, column 3: in the same row, to the left (columns 1 and 2). So row 1 columns 1,2,3 would be 2? But the output for Example 2 is [2,2,0]. Wait, maybe only the cells to the left (columns less than current) become 2. So for row 1, column 3: columns 1 and 2 in row 1 become 2. Then for row 3, column 1: the cell above is row 2, column 1. So in the output, row 2, column 1 becomes 2. But the output in Example 2 is:\n\n[2,2,0]\n[0,0,0]\n[0,0,0]\n\nHmm, that doesn't fit. So maybe the 1 in row 3, column 1 would affect the cell above (row 2, column 1) and to the left (but there are no columns to the left of column 1). So only row 2 column 1 would be 2. But in the output, it's not. So maybe this approach isn't correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s in the output are in the first row, and the number of 2s depends on the positions of the 1s in the input. Looking at Example 3: input has row 1, column 2 and row 2, column 3. Output is [2,2,0]. So for the 1 in row 1, column 2, maybe the first row's columns up to 2 are 2. For the 1 in row 2, column 3, maybe it contributes to the first row's columns up to 3? But the output only has up to column 2. So maybe it's the maximum column among all 1s in the input. But in Example 3, the max column is 3 (from row 2, column 3). But output's first row is [2,2,0], so up to column 2. Hmm, that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's based on the sum of the columns. Let's count how many 1s are in each column. For Example 0: column 1 has 1, others 0. Output has 2 in column 1. Example 1: columns 1 and 2 have 1 each. Output has 2s in columns 1 and 2. Example 2: columns 1 and 3 have 1 each. Output has 2s in columns 1 and 2. Wait, that doesn't fit. So this approach isn't working.\n\nAnother angle: maybe the output's first row is the union of all columns that have a 1 in any row. But for Example 2, columns 1 and 3 have 1s, but output's first row has columns 1 and 2 as 2. So that's not.\n\nWait, let's look at Example 2's input again. The 1s are in row 1 column 3 and row 3 column 1. The output is [2,2,0] in the first row. So how does that happen? Maybe the 1s in column 1 (from row 3) affect the first row's columns 1 and 2, and the 1 in column 3 (row 1) affects columns 1-3. But the output only has columns 1 and 2 as 2. Maybe overlapping? But why not column 3?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output's first row is determined by the leftmost and rightmost positions of 1s in the input. For instance, the leftmost column with a 1 and the rightmost. Then, all columns between them in the first row become 2. Let's check.\n\nExample 0: leftmost and rightmost is column 1. So first row column 1 is 2. Correct.\n\nExample 1: leftmost column 1 (row 2), rightmost column 2 (row 1). So columns 1-2 become 2. Correct.\n\nExample 2: leftmost column 1 (row 3), rightmost column 3 (row 1). So columns 1-3 should be 2. But output is [2,2,0]. So that doesn't fit. So maybe that's not it.\n\nHmm. Let's think differently. Maybe each 1 in the input \"activates\" certain cells in the output. For example, a 1 in row r, column c causes cells in the output's first row up to column (r + c - 1) or something like that. But that's just a wild guess.\n\nLooking at Example 5: input has 1s in (1,1), (1,2), (3,1). Output first row is all 2s. So [2,2,2]. So for each 1, maybe they contribute to the first row's columns. The 1 in (1,1) and (1,2) would affect their own row. The 1 in (3,1) would affect the first row's columns. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is determined by the sum of the rows. For example, each 1 in row r contributes to the first row's columns in a certain way. For instance, a 1 in row r column c would add 1 to the first row's column (c + (r-1)). But that's just a hypothesis.\n\nWait, in Example 0: the 1 is in row 2, column 1. If (row 2, column 1) affects the first row's column 1 (since 2-1=1, so same column?), but that's already covered. Example 1: row 1, column 2 and row 2, column 1. If row 1, column 2 would add to first row column 2 + (1-1) = 2. Row 2, column 1 adds to first row column 1 + (2-1) = 2? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each 1 in the input contributes to the first row by setting all columns from 1 up to (current column + (current row -1)) to 2. Let's test this.\n\nExample 0: row 2, column 1. current column is 1, current row is 2. So 1 + (2-1) = 2. So columns 1-2 in first row become 2. But output is [2,0,0]. So that's not matching. So this can't be.\n\nAnother approach: perhaps the output is a \"flood fill\" from the top-left, where each 1 in the input allows the flood to spread. Wait, maybe the 2s in the output are all connected, starting from the top-left, and the presence of 1s in certain positions allows the flood to reach certain columns. For example, each 1 in a column allows the flood to proceed to the right in the first row.\n\nIn Example 0, there's a 1 in column 1 (row 2), which allows the first row's column 1 to be 2. Example 1 has a 1 in column 1 (row 2) and column 2 (row 1), so the flood can go to column 2. Example 2: 1 in column 1 (row 3) allows flood to column 1, and 1 in column 3 (row 1) might not affect the flood if the path is blocked. Hmm, but output is [2,2,0], which suggests flood went up to column 2. So perhaps the 1s in lower rows (like row 3, column 1) affect the flood path. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each 1 in the input grid allows the first row to have 2s up to that 1's column. For example, if there's a 1 in column c in any row, then the first row's column c is 2. But in Example 2, there's a 1 in column 3, but the output's first row column 3 is 0. So that can't be.\n\nWait, let's look at Example 2's output again. The input is:\n\nRow 1: [0,0,1]\n\nRow 3: [1,0,0]\n\nThe output is:\n\n[2,2,0]\n\nSo why columns 1 and 2 in the first row? The 1 in row 3, column 1: maybe it affects the first row's columns 1 and 2. The 1 in row 1, column 3: maybe it affects columns 1-3. But combining both, the first row's columns 1-3 would be 2. But the output is only up to column 2. So that's not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each 1 in the input grid contributes to the first row's 2s in a way that the maximum column affected by any 1 is the number of 2s. Wait, in Example 2, the 1 in row 3, column 1 might only affect the first row's column 1, but the 1 in row 1, column 3 affects the first row's columns 1, 2, 3. But the output is columns 1 and 2. So why not column 3?\n\nThis is getting confusing. Let's look for another pattern. Let's consider all the outputs and see what they have in common. The output always has 2s in the first row, and sometimes in lower rows. For example, in example 7, the output has 2s in row 2, column 2. Example 8 has 2s in row 2 column 2. So perhaps there's a two-step process.\n\nAnother idea: each 1 in the input grid turns into a 2 in the cell directly above it. If that cell is already a 2, it stays. But also, if there are multiple 1s, their effects stack. For example, in Example 1, the 1 in row 1 column 2 would turn the cell above (which is row 0, non-existent) so maybe it affects the same column in row 1. Wait, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, maybe each 1 in row r, column c turns the cell in row r-1, column c into a 2. If r-1 is 0, then it wraps around or something. Let's test this.\n\nExample 0: 1 is in row 2, column 1. So row 2-1=1, column 1 becomes 2. Output's row 1 column 1 is 2. Correct.\n\nExample 1: 1 in row 1, column 2. So row 0, which doesn't exist. Maybe it's ignored. But there's another 1 in row 2, column 1. So row 1, column 1 becomes 2. So the output's first row would be [2,0,0], but the actual output is [2,2,0]. So this can't be right. So perhaps there's another rule.\n\nWait, maybe each 1 in the input grid affects the cells to the left and above. For example, a 1 at (r,c) turns the cell (r-1, c) and (r, c-1) into 2, but only if those cells exist. Let's test this.\n\nExample 0: 1 at (2,1). So affects (1,1) and (2,0). (2,0) doesn't exist. So (1,1) becomes 2. Output is correct.\n\nExample 1: 1 at (1,2) and (2,1). \n\nFor (1,2): affects (0,2) and (1,1). (0,2) doesn't exist. (1,1) becomes 2.\n\nFor (2,1): affects (1,1) and (2,0). (1,1) is already 2. So the output's first row would be [2,0,0], but the actual output is [2,2,0]. So this approach is missing something.\n\nHmm. Maybe each 1 also affects the cell to the right? Or perhaps there's a cumulative effect where each 1 contributes to the first row's columns up to its own column plus some offset.\n\nLet me look at example 5's input:\n\nInput:\n\n[1,1,0]\n\n[0,0,0]\n\n[1,0,0]\n\nOutput:\n\n[2,2,2]\n\nSo the first row of output has all 2s. The input has three 1s: row 1 columns 1 and 2, and row 3 column 1. \n\nIf each 1 in column c contributes to the first row's columns up to c. So for row 1 column 1: columns 1. Row 1 column 2: columns 1-2. Row 3 column 1: columns 1. Combining all, the first row columns 1-2. But output is columns 1-3 as 2. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each 1 in row r and column c contributes to the first row's column (c + r -1). For example, a 1 in row 2, column 1 would add to column 1+2-1=2. But in Example 0, this would lead to column 2, but output is column 1. So that's not.\n\nAlternatively, the sum of the row and column indices. But not sure.\n\nAnother approach: Let's think of the output as having 2s in all cells that are either directly above a 1 or to the left of a 1 in the same row. So for each 1 in (r, c), in the output, the cells (r-1, c) and all cells to the left in row r-1 would become 2. Let's test this.\n\nExample 0: 1 in (2,1). So in output row 1, column 1 becomes 2. Correct.\n\nExample 1: 1 in (1,2) and (2,1). \n\nFor (1,2): since row is 1, r-1=0 (non-existent), so maybe it's ignored. For (2,1): r-1=1. So in row 1, column 1 becomes 2. But the output is [2,2,0]. So missing the second 2. So perhaps if a 1 is in row 1, it affects the same row. Wait, perhaps the rule is that for each 1 in (r,c), all cells to the left in row r (including c) become 2. But then, how does that affect other rows?\n\nWait, but the output is not just the same row. For example, example 0's 1 is in row 2, but output is row 1. So perhaps the rule is: for each 1 in (r,c), all cells to the left in the row above (r-1) become 2.\n\nLet's see. Example 0: 1 in (2,1). So in row 1, columns up to 1 become 2. So [2,0,0]. Correct.\n\nExample 1: 1 in (2,1) and (1,2). \n\nFor (2,1): row 1 columns 1 become 2.\n\nFor (1,2): row 0 (non-existent), so ignored. Wait, but output is [2,2,0]. So how does the 1 in row 1, column 2 affect row 1's columns?\n\nWait, maybe the rule is that for each 1 in (r,c), in the output, the row above (r-1) gets 2s in columns 1 through c. And if there are multiple 1s in different rows, their contributions combine.\n\nSo for example, example 0: 1 in row 2, column 1. So row 1 (r-1) has columns 1 through 1 set to 2. So [2,0,0].\n\nExample 1: 1 in row 2, column 1 (so row 1, columns 1) and 1 in row 1, column 2 (so row 0, which is ignored). So row 1's columns 1 are 2. But the output is [2,2,0]. So this doesn't fit. Unless the 1 in row 1, column 2 affects row 1's own columns up to 2. Because if the rule is that a 1 in row r, column c sets the row r-1's columns up to c to 2. But for a 1 in row 1, r-1 is 0, which is invalid, so ignored. But then the output for example 1 should be [2,0,0], which it's not. So that's a problem.\n\nBut in example 1's output, it's [2,2,0]. So maybe the 1 in row 1, column 2 is affecting the same row. So perhaps the rule is: for each 1 in (r,c), set all columns to the left (including c) in row r-1 and row r to 2. But then, example 1's 1 in row 1, column 2 would set row 0 (ignored) and row 1's columns up to 2 to 2. The 1 in row 2, column 1 would set row 1's columns up to 1. Combining, row 1 would have columns 1 and 2 set to 2. Which matches the output. That seems plausible.\n\nLet's test this with example 1:\n\nInput has 1s at (1,2) and (2,1).\n\nFor (1,2): row r=1, c=2. So set row 0 (ignored) and row 1's columns 1-2 to 2.\n\nFor (2,1): row r=2, c=1. So set row 1's columns 1-1 (just 1) and row 2's columns 1. But the output's row 1 is [2,2,0], which fits because the first 1 in row 1 contributes columns 1-2, and the 1 in row 2 contributes column 1. But overlapping, so row 1's columns 1 and 2 are 2.\n\nThis seems to work. Let's check example 2:\n\nInput is row 1, column 3 and row 3, column 1.\n\nFor row 1, column 3: r=1, so set row 0 (ignored) and row 1's columns 1-3. So row 1 would have 2s in 1-3. But the output's first row is [2,2,0]. Hmm, that's a discrepancy. \n\nWait, maybe the rule is that for each 1 in (r,c), set columns up to c in row r-1. And if r=1, then row 0 is ignored, but row 1's own columns are set. Wait, but in example 2's input, the 1 in row 1, column 3 would set row 0 (ignored) and row 1's columns 1-3 to 2. The 1 in row 3, column 1 would set row 2's columns 1 (but output row 2 is [0,0,0]) and row 3's columns 1. But the output's first row is [2,2,0]. So this doesn't fit. So this theory is invalid.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is that for each 1 in (r,c), set columns up to c in row r-1 to 2. So if r=1, then row 0 (ignored). For r=3, row 2, columns up to c. But example 2's output doesn't show anything in row 2. Hmm.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Let's look at another example. Example 3: input is row 1 column 2 and row 2 column 3. Output first row [2,2,0]. \n\nIf the rule is for each 1 in (r,c), set row r-1 columns up to c. So for row 1 column 2: row 0, ignored. For row 2 column 3: row 1 columns 1-3. So row 1 should be [2,2,2], but output is [2,2,0]. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAnother idea: maybe the output's first row is the cumulative OR of all columns that have a 1 in any row below. Like, if any row below (including current row) has a 1 in column c, then the first row's column c is 2. But example 0: row 2 has 1 in column 1. So first row column 1 is 2. Example 1: row 1 has 1 in column 2, row 2 has 1 in column 1. So first row columns 1 and 2 are 2. Example 2: row 1 has 1 in column 3, row 3 has 1 in column 1. So first row columns 1 and 3 would be 2, but output is [2,2,0]. So this doesn't fit.\n\nWait, but example 2's output has columns 1 and 2 as 2. So perhaps it's not OR but something else. Maybe the first row's columns up to the maximum column of any 1 in the input, but considering some adjustment. Like, the maximum column minus 1. But in example 2, the maximum column is 3, so 3-1=2. So first row up to column 2. That would fit. Let's check:\n\nExample 0: max column 1 \u2192 1 \u2192 columns 1. Correct.\n\nExample 1: max column 2 \u2192 columns 1-2. Correct.\n\nExample 2: max column 3 \u2192 3-1=2 \u2192 columns 1-2. Correct.\n\nExample 3: max column 3 (from row 2, column 3) \u2192 3-1=2 \u2192 columns 1-2. Output is [2,2,0], correct.\n\nExample 4: input is [0,0,1] in row 1, others 0. Max column 3 \u2192 3-1=2 \u2192 columns 1-2. But output is [2,0,0]. Wait, that's a problem. Example 4's output is [2,0,0], but according to this, it should be [2,2,0]. So this theory is invalid.\n\nExample 4's input is:\n\n[0,0,1]\n\n[0,0,0]\n\n[0,0,0]\n\nOutput is [2,0,0]. So the 1 is in column 3, row 1. According to the previous theory, max column 3-1=2. So first row columns 1-2. But output is only column 1. So this theory is incorrect.\n\nHmm. Let's think again. Maybe it's the sum of the rows. Like, for each row, the leftmost 1 in that row determines how many columns in the first row are set to 2. But I'm not sure.\n\nAnother approach: look at how many 2s are in the output's first row for each example. Let's list them:\n\nExample 0: 1\n\nExample 1: 2\n\nExample 2: 2\n\nExample 3: 2\n\nExample 4: 1\n\nExample 5: 3\n\nExample 6: 3\n\nExample 7: 3 in row 1, 1 in row 2.\n\nExample 8: 3 in row 1, 1 in row 2.\n\nExample 9: 3 in row 1, 1 in row 2.\n\nSo the number of 2s in the first row increases with the number of 1s in the input. But not exactly. For example, example 5 has three 1s, and output first row has 3 2s. Example 6 has two 1s but output first row has 3 2s. So perhaps it's not the count but the positions.\n\nWait, example 6's input is:\n\n[0,1,0]\n\n[1,1,0]\n\n[0,0,0]\n\nSo 1s are at (1,2), (2,1), (2,2). The output first row is [2,2,2]. So three 2s. How does that happen?\n\nIf the rule is that the first row's columns up to the maximum column of any 1 in the input. In example 6, the maximum column is 2. So columns 1-2 would be 2, but output is 3. So no.\n\nAlternatively, if each 1 contributes to the first row's columns up to their own column, and the union of all those ranges is the final output. For example, in example 6, the 1s are in columns 2, 1, 2. So the ranges would be columns up to 2 for the row 1 and 2. So union is up to 2. But output has three columns. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the first row's columns are determined by the sum of all columns where a 1 exists in any row, but with some multiplier based on the row. For example, a 1 in row r, column c adds r to the first row's column c. If the sum reaches a certain threshold, it becomes 2. But example 0 has 1 in row 2, column 1 \u2192 sum 2 in column 1. Example 1: row 2, column 1 \u2192 sum 2 in column 1. Row 1, column 2 \u2192 sum 1. But output columns 1 and 2 are 2. So threshold must be >=1, but that would make all columns with at least one 1 to be 2. But example 2's output is [2,2,0], but there's a 1 in column 3. So this theory is incorrect.\n\nI'm stuck. Let's try to look for a different pattern. Looking at example 7:\n\nInput:\n\n[1,1,0]\n\n[0,0,0]\n\n[1,0,1]\n\nOutput:\n\n[2,2,2]\n\n[0,2,0]\n\n[0,0,0]\n\nAh, the output has 2s in row 2, column 2. How did that happen? Input has 1s in row 1 columns 1-2, and row 3 columns 1 and 3. So maybe each 1 in the input propagates 2s upwards and to the left, and possibly in other directions.\n\nAnother possibility: the output is generated by a cellular automaton-like rule where each 1 in the input generates 2s in all directions (up, down, left, right) until it hits the edge, but this seems too vague.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is built by processing each row from bottom to top and left to right. For each 1 found, mark the cell above and to the left in the output as 2. Let's try example 7:\n\nInput rows:\n\nRow 3: [1,0,1]\n\nRow 2: [0,0,0]\n\nRow 1: [1,1,0]\n\nProcessing from bottom up (row 3 first):\n\nFor row 3, column 1: mark row 2, column 1 and row 3, column 0 (invalid). So row 2 column 1 becomes 2. Then row 3 column 3: mark row 2, column 3 and row 3, column 2. So row 2 column 3 becomes 2, and row 3 column 2 becomes 2.\n\nThen row 2: no 1s.\n\nRow 1: columns 1 and 2. For column 1: mark row 0, column 1 (invalid) and row 1 column 0 (invalid). For column 2: mark row 0, column 2 (invalid) and row 1 column 1. So row 1 column 1 becomes 2.\n\nBut the output for example 7 is:\n\nRow 1: [2,2,2]\n\nRow 2: [0,2,0]\n\nSo this doesn't fit.\n\nThis is getting frustrating. Let's try to think of another approach. Maybe the output grid represents the number of 1s in each column in the input, but capped at 2. For example, if a column has one or more 1s, it becomes 2. But example 4 has a 1 in column 3, so output column 3 should be 2, but output is [2,0,0]. So that's not.\n\nWait, example 4's input is:\n\n[0,0,1]\n\n[0,0,0]\n\n[0,0,0]\n\nOutput is [2,0,0]. So why is column 1 in the output set to 2 when there's a 1 in column 3? That doesn't make sense. So this theory is wrong.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps the 2s in the first row are determined by the positions of the 1s in the input, but shifted left by their row index. For example, a 1 in row r, column c becomes a 2 in row 1, column c - (r-1). If the result is a valid column, otherwise ignored.\n\nExample 0: row 2, column 1 \u2192 1 - (2-1) = 0 \u2192 column 0 invalid. So ignored. But output is [2,0,0]. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, shifted right. Example 0: row 2, column 1 \u2192 1 + (2-1) = 2. So column 2. But output is column 1. No.\n\nThis is taking too long. Let's try to find a pattern in the outputs. For all examples except 7,8,9, the output's first row is filled with 2s up to a certain column, and the subsequent rows are all zeros. Starting from example 7, the output has 2s in lower rows as well. For example, example 7's output has a 2 in row 2, column 2. Example 8's output has a 2 in row 2, column 2. Example 9's output has 2 in row 2, column 2.\n\nSo perhaps there's a second rule when there are multiple 1s in certain configurations. Like, if there's a certain number of 1s or their positions allow the 2s to propagate downward.\n\nLet me consider example 7's input:\n\nInput is:\n\nRow 1: [1,1,0]\n\nRow 2: [0,0,0]\n\nRow 3: [1,0,1]\n\nOutput:\n\nRow 1: [2,2,2]\n\nRow 2: [0,2,0]\n\nRow 3: [0,0,0]\n\nSo, the 2 in row 2, column 2. How does that happen? The input has 1s in row 1 columns 1 and 2, row 3 columns 1 and 3. Maybe when there's a 1 in both row r and row r+2 in the same column, then the middle row's column gets a 2. For example, in column 1, there's a 1 in row 1 and 3. So the middle row (row 2) column 1 gets a 2. But in example 7's output, row 2 column 2 is 2. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe when a column has 1s in multiple rows, the output's lower rows get 2s.\n\nAlternatively, the output's lower rows are generated by the same rule as the first row but shifted down. For example, each 1 in row r, column c affects the row r-1's columns up to c, and this may cascade. Like, the 2s in the first row might then affect the second row.\n\nBut how to see this. Let's take example 7:\n\nInput 1s are in row 1, columns 1-2; row 3, columns 1 and 3.\n\nFirst, the 1s in row 1 would affect row 0 (ignored) and their own row's columns up to 1 and 2. So row 1's columns 1-2 become 2, but output is [2,2,2]. So perhaps the 1 in row 3, column 1 affects row 2's column 1. Then, row 2's column 1 is 2, which might affect row 1's columns up to 1. But how does that lead to row 1's column 3 being 2?\n\nAlternatively, it's possible that after processing the initial 1s, the 2s generated are then processed as 1s for the next step. Like a chain reaction. For example, each 1 generates 2s in certain cells, then those 2s act as new sources for more 2s.\n\nIn example 7, initial 1s are in row 1 columns 1-2, row 3 columns 1 and 3.\n\nProcessing row 1's 1s:\n\n- Row 1, column 1: set row 0 (ignored) and row 1's columns 1-1 \u2192 row 1 column 1 becomes 2.\n\n- Row 1, column 2: set row 0 (ignored) and row 1's columns 1-2. So columns 1 and 2 are 2.\n\nProcessing row 3's 1s:\n\n- Row 3, column 1: set row 2 columns 1-1 \u2192 row 2 column 1 becomes 2.\n\n- Row 3, column 3: set row 2 columns 1-3 \u2192 row 2 columns 1-3 become 2.\n\nBut the output row 2 is [0,2,0]. So this doesn't fit. Unless there's an overlay where some 2s are overwritten.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are generated in multiple passes. First, process all 1s in the input, then process any new 2s generated as if they were 1s, and repeat until no more changes.\n\nExample 7's first pass:\n\nRow 1, column 1: set row 0 (ignored) and row 1's columns 1-1 \u2192 row 1 column 1 is 2.\n\nRow 1, column 2: set row 0 (ignored) and row 1's columns 1-2 \u2192 row 1 columns 1-2 are 2.\n\nRow 3, column 1: set row 2's columns 1-1 \u2192 row 2 column 1 is 2.\n\nRow 3, column 3: set row 2's columns 1-3 \u2192 row 2 columns 1-3 are 2.\n\nNow, after first pass, row 1 is [2,2,0], row 2 is [2,2,2].\n\nThen, in the second pass, process the 2s as if they were 1s:\n\nRow 1, column 1 (2): treat as 1, set row 0 (ignored) and row 1's columns 1-1 \u2192 already 2.\n\nRow 1, column 2 (2): set row 0 (ignored) and row 1's columns 1-2 \u2192 already 2.\n\nRow 2, column 1 (2): set row 1's columns 1-1 \u2192 already 2.\n\nRow 2, columns 2 and 3 (2): set row 1's columns 1-2 and 1-3.\n\nSo after second pass, row 1 columns 3 becomes 2. So row 1 becomes [2,2,2]. Row 2 columns 1-3 are 2, but output for row 2 is [0,2,0]. So this doesn't match. So this theory isn't correct.\n\nAnother idea: maybe the output's first row is the sum of the columns of the input. For example, if a column has at least one 1, the first row's corresponding column is 2. But example 4 has a 1 in column 3, output is [2,0,0]. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output's first row is the sum of the rows of the input. For example, each 1 in any row adds to the first row's columns. But this is vague.\n\nI'm running out of ideas. Let's look at the test input:\n\nTest Input:\n\n[0, 1, 0]\n\n[0, 1, 1]\n\n[1, 0, 0]\n\nSo, rows:\n\nRow 1: [0,1,0]\n\nRow 2: [0,1,1]\n\nRow 3: [1,0,0]\n\nLooking for the output. Let's try to apply the pattern from examples 7,8,9 where output has 2s in lower rows.\n\nIn example 7, the output had 2 in row 2 column 2. Let's see what's common between the inputs of examples 7,8,9:\n\nExample 7's input has 1s in row 1 (columns 1,2), row 3 (columns 1,3). Output has row 1 all 2s, row 2 column 2.\n\nExample 8's input: row 1 column 2, row 2 columns 1-2, row 3 column 1. Output row 1 all 2s, row 2 column 2.\n\nExample 9's input: row 1 column 1, row 2 column 3, row 3 columns 2-3. Output row 1 all 2s, row 2 column 2.\n\nSo it seems that when certain conditions are met (like multiple 1s in certain positions), the output's row 2 column 2 is set to 2.\n\nThe test input has 1s in row 1 column 2, row 2 columns 2-3, row 3 column 1. So perhaps the presence of 1s in columns that form a diagonal or certain shape causes the middle cell (row 2 column 2) to become 2.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is that if there's a 1 in the center column (column 2) of any row, then the output's row 2 column 2 becomes 2. Looking at example 7's input: row 1 column 2 has a 1, row 2 has none, row 3 has none. Output has row 2 column 2 as 2. Example 8's input: row 1 column 2 has a 1, row 2 column 2 has a 1. Output row 2 column 2 is 2. Example 9's input: row 2 column 3 and row 3 columns 2-3. So no 1 in column 2, but output row 2 column 2 is 2. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, the presence of 1s in all three rows may trigger the middle cell to become 2. In example 7, rows 1 and 3 have 1s, but row 2 has none. Example 8 has 1s in all three rows. Example 9 has 1s in all three rows. Test input has 1s in all three rows. So maybe when all three rows have at least one 1, the middle cell becomes 2.\n\nLet's check examples:\n\nExample 7: rows 1,3 have 1s \u2192 output has middle cell 2.\n\nExample 8: all three rows \u2192 middle cell 2.\n\nExample 9: all three rows \u2192 middle cell 2.\n\nTest input has 1s in all three rows. So according to this, the middle cell (row 2 column 2) would be 2. \n\nBut how does that fit with the other examples? For example, example 5's input has 1s in rows 1 and 3. Output's middle cell is 0. So this theory is invalid.\n\nAnother angle: perhaps the middle cell is set to 2 if there are 1s in all four surrounding cells. But that's not the case in the examples.\n\nAlternatively, the middle cell is set to 2 if there are 1s in certain positions that form a cross or something. But not sure.\n\nThis is really challenging. Let's try to think of the output as a combination of two things: the first row being filled with 2s up to the maximum column of any 1 in the input, and then for each 1 in the input, the cell below and to the right becomes 2. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, let's try to apply the pattern from the examples to the test input.\n\nTest Input:\n\nRow 1: [0,1,0]\n\nRow 2: [0,1,1]\n\nRow 3: [1,0,0]\n\nLooking at the training examples, when there are 1s in multiple rows and columns, the first row's columns are filled with 2s up to the maximum column of any 1, and the middle cell (row 2 column 2) becomes 2.\n\nIn the test input, the 1s are in columns 2 (row 1), 2 and 3 (row 2), and 1 (row 3). The maximum column is 3. So according to the previous incorrect theory, the first row's columns 1-3 would be 2. But some examples like example 2 have a max column of 3 but the first row's third column is 0. So maybe there's a different rule.\n\nAlternatively, the first row's columns are filled with 2s up to the maximum column of any 1 in the input, but not exceeding the first row's length. But that doesn't help.\n\nAlternatively, the number of 2s in the first row is the sum of the columns where there's a 1 in any row. But in the test input, columns 1, 2, 2, 3, 3. So columns 1,2,3 have 1s. So first row would have 2s in all three columns. But example 2's input has columns 1 and 3, but output's first row is [2,2,0]. So this theory is invalid.\n\nAlternatively, the test input's 1s are in row 1 column 2, row 2 columns 2 and 3, row 3 column 1. Looking at example 6's input, which has 1s in row 1 column 2, row 2 columns 1 and 2. Output is first row [2,2,2]. So perhaps when there are 1s in adjacent rows and columns, the first row is filled up to the maximum column. For example 6's input, maximum column is 2, but output has 3 2s. So this theory is incorrect.\n\nI'm really stuck. Let's look for a different approach. Let's see what the output's first row has in common across the examples:\n\nExample 0: 1 in column 1 \u2192 output column 1.\n\nExample 1: 1 in columns 1 and 2 \u2192 output columns 1-2.\n\nExample 2: 1 in columns 1 and 3 \u2192 output columns 1-2.\n\nExample 3: 1 in columns 2 and 3 \u2192 output columns 1-2.\n\nExample 4: 1 in column 3 \u2192 output column 1.\n\nExample 5: 1s in columns 1,2,1 \u2192 output columns 1-3.\n\nExample 6: 1s in columns 2,1,2 \u2192 output columns 1-3.\n\nExample 7: 1s in columns 1,2,1,3 \u2192 output columns 1-3.\n\nExample 8: 1s in columns 2,1,2,1 \u2192 output columns 1-3.\n\nExample 9: 1s in columns 1,3,2,3 \u2192 output columns 1-3.\n\nSo, it seems that when the input has 1s in columns that are contiguous or form a certain pattern, the first row's columns up to a certain point are filled with 2s. But how to determine that point.\n\nLooking at example 2: columns 1 and 3 have 1s. Output's first row is [2,2,0]. So columns 1-2. Example 3 has columns 2 and 3, output is [2,2,0]. So columns 1-2. Example 4 has column 3, output is column 1. \n\nThis suggests that the first row's columns are filled up to the minimum column plus 1. But example 2's minimum column is 1. 1+1=2. So columns 1-2. Example 3's minimum is 2. 2+1=3. But output is columns 1-2. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, it's the maximum column minus 1. Example 2: max 3-1=2. Columns 1-2. Example 3: max 3-1=2. Columns 1-2. Example 4: max 3-1=2. But output is column 1. So that's inconsistent.\n\nAnother possibility: the first row's columns are filled up to the number of distinct columns in the input. Example 0: 1 column \u2192 1. Example 1: 2 \u2192 2. Example 2: 2 columns (1 and 3) \u2192 2. Example 3: 2 \u2192 2. Example 4: 1 \u2192 1. Example 5: 2 columns (1 and 2) \u2192 3? No. So no.\n\nThis is really frustrating. Let's try to think of the first row's 2s as representing the path of a knight's move in chess. For example, each 1 in the input allows a knight's move to mark a 2. But this seems unlikely.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output's first row is the result of a bitwise OR operation across the rows. For each column, if any row has a 1 in that column, the first row's column is 2. But example 4's output is [2,0,0], but input has a 1 in column 3. So that's not possible.\n\nI'm running out of time. Let's try to make a guess based on the test input. Test input has 1s in row 1 column 2, row 2 columns 2 and 3, row 3 column 1. Looking at similar examples, example 6's input has 1s in row 1,2,2, and output's first row is [2,2,2]. Example 6's input has 1s in row 1 column 2, row 2 columns 1 and 2. Output is first row all 2s. So perhaps when there are multiple 1s in adjacent columns in different rows, the first row is filled completely. \n\nThe test input has 1s in row 1 column 2, row 2 columns 2 and 3, row 3 column 1. The maximum column is 3, but in example 2, which has a max column of 3, the output's first row is [2,2,0]. So this doesn't fit. But in example 6, which has a max column of 2, the output's first row is filled to 3. So perhaps there's a different rule.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the number of 2s in the first row is the sum of the columns of all 1s divided by the number of rows. But this is just a wild guess.\n\nGiven that I'm stuck, I'll try to deduce the answer based on the test input. The test input has 1s in row 1 column 2, row 2 columns 2 and 3, row 3 column 1. Looking at similar examples, example 6's output is [2,2,2], and example 7's output also has [2,2,2] in the first row. So perhaps the test input's first row will be [2,2,2]. Additionally, since the test input has 1s in all three rows, perhaps the middle cell (row 2 column 2) becomes 2. So the output would be:\n\n[2,2,2]\n\n[0,2,0]\n\n[0,0,0]\n\nWhich matches the pattern of examples 7,8,9. So this is my best guess."
