        "cot_1": "Okay, let's tackle this puzzle. So, the task is to figure out the pattern that transforms the input matrices into the output ones. Let me look at the training examples carefully.\n\nStarting with Example 0. The input is a 5x5 matrix. The output is a 2x2 matrix. Let me see how the input relates to the output. Let's look at the input rows:\n\nFirst row: [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]\nSecond row: [2, 2, 0, 2, 2]\nThird row is all zeros.\nFourth row: [0, 2, 0, 2, 2]\nFifth row: [2, 2, 0, 2, 0]\n\nThe output is two rows:\n[2, 2]\n[2, 0]\n\nHmm. How does that come from the input? Let's check positions. Maybe it's taking certain elements from the input. Let's see the output's first element is 2. In the input's first row, the first element is 0, but maybe it's looking at the last element of the first row? The first row ends with 2. The second row's last element is 2. The output first row is [2,2], maybe combining the last elements of the first two rows. Then the second output row is [2,0], which might be the last elements of the fourth and fifth rows. Let me check:\n\nFirst row last element: 2 (from input row 0)\nSecond row last element: 2 (from input row 1)\nFourth row last element: 2 (input row 3)\nFifth row last element: 0 (input row 4)\n\nSo the output would be [[2,2], [2,0]], which matches Example 0's output. Wait, but in Example 0's output, the second row is [2,0]. Let me confirm:\n\nYes, input rows 3 (fourth) ends with 2, row 4 (fifth) ends with 0. So that's [2,0]. So maybe the output is formed by taking the last element of the first two rows, then the last elements of the fourth and fifth rows. But why those rows?\n\nWait, but the third row is all zeros, so maybe it's being skipped. So the output is taking the last elements from the non-zero rows? Let's see:\n\nIn Example 0, the input has rows:\n\nRow 0: [0,2,0,0,2] (ends with 2)\nRow1: [2,2,0,2,2] (ends with 2)\nRow2: all zeros (so maybe skipped)\nRow3: [0,2,0,2,2] (ends with 2)\nRow4: [2,2,0,2,0] (ends with 0)\n\nSo the output is first taking row0 and row1's last elements (2 and 2) for the first output row. Then row3 and row4's last elements (2 and 0) for the second output row. That would form [2,2] and [2,0], matching the output. That seems plausible.\n\nLet's check Example 1. Input:\n\nRow0: [1,0,0,1,0] ends with 0\nRow1: [0,1,0,0,1] ends with 1\nRow2: all zeros\nRow3: [1,0,0,1,0] ends with 0\nRow4: [1,1,0,0,1] ends with 1\n\nThe output is [1,0] and [1,1]. Wait, according to the previous pattern, the first output row would be the last elements of row0 and row1: 0 and 1 \u2192 [0,1], but the actual output is [1,0]. Hmm, that doesn't fit. So maybe my initial hypothesis is wrong.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is taking the first and last elements of some rows. Let me see Example 1's output: [1,0] and [1,1]. Let's look at the input rows. Maybe the first row's first and last elements are 1 and 0. The second row's first and last are 0 and 1. The output rows could be combinations of these. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking two pairs from the input. For Example 1's output:\n\nFirst output row [1,0] could be the first element of row0 (1) and the last element of row0 (0). Then the second output row [1,1] is the first element of row4 (1) and the last element of row4 (1). But why those rows?\n\nWait, in Example 0, the output rows are 2 elements each, and there are 2 output rows. So the output is a 2x2 matrix. The input has 5 rows, but perhaps the output is constructed from the first two and last two non-zero rows, ignoring the middle (all-zero) row.\n\nWait, in Example 0, the third row is all zeros, so maybe the rows are split into two parts: rows 0-1 (non-zero) and rows 3-4 (since row2 is zero). Then, for each of these pairs, take the first and last element? Or some other elements.\n\nLooking at Example 0's input rows:\n\nRow0: [0,2,0,0,2]\nRow1: [2,2,0,2,2]\nRow3: [0,2,0,2,2]\nRow4: [2,2,0,2,0]\n\nThe output rows are [2,2] and [2,0]. Let's see:\n\nFor the first output row, maybe the first element of row0 and the last element of row1. Row0 starts with 0, but output is 2. Hmm, no. Alternatively, maybe the last element of row0 and row1: 2 and 2 \u2192 [2,2]. Then row3 and row4's last elements: 2 and 0 \u2192 [2,0]. That matches. So the pattern could be: for each pair of consecutive rows before the all-zero row, take their last elements, and then for the consecutive rows after the all-zero row, take their last elements. Then combine these pairs into the output.\n\nBut how does this work for Example1?\n\nExample1 input:\n\nRow0: [1,0,0,1,0] \u2192 last element 0\nRow1: [0,1,0,0,1] \u2192 last element 1\nRow3: [1,0,0,1,0] \u2192 last element 0\nRow4: [1,1,0,0,1] \u2192 last element 1\n\nSo according to the previous pattern, first output row would be [0,1], second [0,1], but the actual output is [1,0] and [1,1]. So that doesn't match. So maybe the pattern is different.\n\nWait, maybe the output is taking the first and last elements of the first and fourth rows. Let's check:\n\nExample0:\n\nFirst row first element 0, last 2. Fourth row first 0, last 2. But output is [2,2] and [2,0]. Doesn't fit.\n\nAlternative approach: Maybe the output is the second and fourth elements of certain rows. Let me see.\n\nFor Example0's output first row [2,2]. Looking at row1 and row3's elements:\n\nRow1 has elements 2,2,0,2,2. Second element is 2, fourth is 2. So [2,2] maybe.\n\nRow4 has elements 2,2,0,2,0. Second element 2, fourth 2. But the output's second row is [2,0]. Hmm, not matching.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is formed by taking the non-zero elements from the first and last positions of each row after the middle (all-zero) row. Or perhaps the non-zero elements from the first and last positions of the top and bottom parts.\n\nWait, maybe the input is divided into two parts: above and below the middle row. The middle row is all zeros. The output is formed by taking the first and last elements of the first two rows (above the middle) and the first and last elements of the last two rows (below the middle). But let's check:\n\nExample0:\n\nAbove middle (rows 0 and 1):\n\nRow0 first and last: 0, 2.\n\nRow1 first and last: 2, 2.\n\nBut the first output row is [2,2]. Hmm, maybe combining the last elements of row0 and row1 (2 and 2) gives the first output row. Then rows 3 and 4 (below middle) last elements: 2 and 0, giving [2,0]. That matches Example0's output.\n\nExample1's input:\n\nRows above middle (rows0 and 1):\n\nRow0 last element 0, row1 last element 1 \u2192 [0,1]. But output first row is [1,0]. Doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the first output row is the last elements of row1 and row0, reversed. Like [1,0]. Then rows3 and4's last elements are 0 and 1 \u2192 [0,1]. But the output is [1,0] and [1,1]. Hmm, not matching.\n\nWait, the output of Example1 is [1,0] and [1,1]. Let's look at their input rows. Maybe the output is formed by taking the first element of row0 and the last element of row0. Row0 is [1,0,0,1,0], first is 1, last is 0 \u2192 [1,0]. Then row4 is [1,1,0,0,1], first is 1, last is 1 \u2192 [1,1]. That would explain the output. But why row0 and row4?\n\nBut how does this relate to the middle zero row? Maybe the output is taking the first row (row0) and the last row (row4). But then in Example0, row0's first and last are 0 and 2, row4's first and last are 2 and 0. So combining those would be [0,2] and [2,0], but the actual output is [2,2] and [2,0]. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by looking at the columns. For Example0's input, maybe the non-zero columns? Let's look at the input as columns:\n\nColumn0: 0,2,0,0,2 \u2192 [0,2,0,0,2]\n\nColumn1: 2,2,0,2,2\n\nColumn2: all zeros except in the middle (0)\n\nColumn3:0,2,0,2,2\n\nColumn4:2,2,0,2,0\n\nBut how would columns relate to the output?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the sum or product of certain rows, but that's less likely given the examples.\n\nLooking back at Example2:\n\nInput:\n\n[8,8,0,0,8]\n\n[8,0,0,8,0]\n\n[0,0,0,0,0]\n\n[8,8,0,8,8]\n\n[8,0,0,8,0]\n\nOutput:\n\n[0,8]\n\n[8,0]\n\nSo output is two rows. If following the same pattern as before, perhaps the last elements of rows0 and1 (8 and 0) for the first output row, then last elements of rows3 and4 (8 and 0). That would give [8,0] and [8,0], but the actual output is [0,8] and [8,0]. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, the first output row is the first element of row0 and the last element of row1. Row0 first is 8, row1 last is 0 \u2192 [8,0], but the actual output first row is [0,8]. Not matching.\n\nHmm. Let me look for another pattern. For Example2's output:\n\n[0,8] and [8,0]. Let's check rows3 and4. Row3's elements are [8,8,0,8,8] \u2192 last is 8. Row4's elements are [8,0,0,8,0] \u2192 last is 0. So maybe the first output row is the last element of row3 (8) and the last element of row4 (0) \u2192 [8,0], but the output's second row is [8,0], which matches. But the first output row is [0,8]. Where does that come from?\n\nWait, perhaps it's the first elements of row0 and row1. Row0 starts with 8, row1 starts with 8. So [8,8], but the output first row is [0,8]. Doesn't fit. Alternatively, maybe the first element of row0 and the last element of row0. Row0 is [8,8,0,0,8], so first 8, last 8 \u2192 [8,8], but output is [0,8]. Not matching.\n\nAlternative approach: Let's think of the output as a 2x2 matrix. Maybe each element comes from a specific position in the input matrix. For example:\n\nIn Example0, the output is:\n\n[2,2]\n\n[2,0]\n\nLooking at the input matrix, perhaps the output positions are:\n\nTop-left: position (1,1) of input (which is 2), top-right: position (1,4) which is 2. Bottom-left: position (3,1) which is 0, bottom-right: position (3,4) which is 2. Wait, that gives [2,2] and [0,2], which doesn't match.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the first and last non-zero elements in each of the top and bottom parts. For Example0, the top two rows (rows0 and1) have first non-zero elements: in row0, the first non-zero is 2 (index1). Last non-zero in row0 is 2 (index4). For row1, the first and last are 2 and 2. But how would that form the output.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the first element of the first non-zero row and the last element of the second non-zero row above the middle. Then the same for the rows below the middle. Let's see:\n\nIn Example0, rows0 and1 are non-zero. The first element of row0 is 0, but that's zero. The first non-zero in row0 is 2 (index1). The last element of row1 is 2. So combining 2 and 2 gives the first output row [2,2]. Then rows3 and4: first non-zero in row3 is 0 (but index0 is 0, then index1 is 2. So first non-zero is 2. Last element of row4 is 0. So combining 2 and 0 gives [2,0]. Which matches the output. \n\nSimilarly, for Example1:\n\nRows0 and1 (above middle). Row0 first non-zero is 1 (index0). Last element of row1 is 1. So output row would be [1,1]. But the actual first output row is [1,0]. Doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. Not matching. \n\nWait, maybe the first output row is the first non-zero element from row0 and the first non-zero element from row1. For Example0:\n\nRow0 first non-zero is index1 (2), row1's first non-zero is index0 (2). So combining 2 and 2 \u2192 [2,2]. That's correct. Then for rows3 and4: row3's first non-zero is index0 (0) but that's zero, so next is index1 (2). Row4's first non-zero is index0 (2). So combining 2 and 2 \u2192 [2,2], but the actual output is [2,0]. So this doesn't work.\n\nAlternative idea: The output might be the sum or difference of certain elements. But given the examples are small numbers, perhaps it's something else.\n\nWait, looking at the Test Input:\n\n[5,5,0,5,0]\n\n[0,5,0,0,5]\n\n[0,0,0,0,0]\n\n[5,5,0,5,5]\n\n[0,5,0,0,5]\n\nThe expected output based on the previous pattern would be? Let's see. If the output is formed by taking the last elements of rows0 and1, then rows3 and4.\n\nRow0's last element is 0. Row1's last element is5. So first output row would be [0,5]. Then rows3's last is5, row4's last is5. So second output row [5,5]. But looking at the examples, for example1, the output rows are [1,0] and [1,1]. So this pattern might not hold.\n\nWait, in Example1, the output is [1,0] and [1,1]. Let's look at the first output row. The first element is 1, which is the first element of row0. The second element is 0, which is the last element of row0. Then the second output row is [1,1], which is the first element of row4 (1) and the last element of row4 (1). So perhaps the output is taking the first and last elements of row0 and row4. But how does that fit with other examples.\n\nIn Example0: row0 first is0, last is2. row4 first is2, last is0. So output would be [0,2] and [2,0], but the actual output is [2,2] and [2,0]. Doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. Not matching. \n\nLet me think differently. The output is a 2x2 matrix, so maybe it's combining elements from two pairs of rows. Let's consider that the middle row is a separator, and the output is formed from the rows above and below.\n\nFor Example0:\n\nAbove middle (rows0 and1):\n\nTake some elements from these two rows.\n\nBelow middle (rows3 and4):\n\nTake elements from these two rows.\n\nWhat if in each pair of rows (0 and1, 3 and4), we take the first element of the first row and the last element of the second row?\n\nExample0:\n\nRows0 and1:\n\nFirst element of row0 is0, last element of row1 is2 \u2192 [0,2]. But the first output row is [2,2]. Not matching.\n\nAlternatively, take the last elements of rows0 and1 \u2192 2 and2 \u2192 [2,2]. Then for rows3 and4: last elements 2 and0 \u2192 [2,0]. That matches Example0's output.\n\nExample1:\n\nRows0 and1's last elements:0 and1 \u2192 [0,1]. Rows3 and4's last elements:0 and1 \u2192 [0,1]. But Example1's output is [1,0] and [1,1]. So this doesn't fit. \n\nWait, Example1's output is [1,0] and [1,1]. Let's see. If the output is taking row0's first element (1) and row1's last element (1) \u2192 [1,1], but that's not the case. The actual first output row is [1,0]. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is taking the first non-zero element from the first two rows and the last non-zero element from the last two rows. For Example1's rows0 and1:\n\nRow0: [1,0,0,1,0]. The first non-zero is1. The last non-zero is1 (at position3). Row1: [0,1,0,0,1]. First non-zero is1 (position1). Last is1 (position4). So combining these. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the maximum value from the rows above and below. But in Example0, the maximum in rows0-1 is2, and rows3-4 is2. But the output is different.\n\nAnother angle: Looking at the output for each example:\n\nExample0 output:\n\n[2,2]\n\n[2,0]\n\nExample1 output:\n\n[1,0]\n\n[1,1]\n\nExample2 output:\n\n[0,8]\n\n[8,0]\n\nNoticing that in Example0 and Example2, the output is a kind of diagonal. For Example0, 2 and 2, then 2 and 0. Maybe the output is the diagonal elements from certain positions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking the second and fourth elements of certain rows. For Example0's first output row:\n\nRow0: elements 2 (index1) and 0 (index3). No. Row1 has elements 2,2,0,2,2. So index1 is2, index3 is2. So [2,2], which matches the first output row. Then for rows3 and4:\n\nRow3: elements 2 (index1), 2 (index3). Row4: 2 (index1), 2 (index3). But the output second row is [2,0]. Doesn't fit.\n\nBut wait, row4 is [2,2,0,2,0]. So index3 is2, but the last element is0. So maybe it's index3 and index4 of row4: 2 and0. But then combining row3's index3 (2) and row4's index4 (0) gives [2,0]. So first output row is row0 index1 (2) and row1 index3 (2) \u2192 [2,2]. Second output row is row3 index3 (2) and row4 index4 (0) \u2192 [2,0]. That fits Example0.\n\nFor Example1:\n\nFirst output row [1,0]. Row0 index1 is0, row1 index3 is0. But [0,0] isn't the output. So maybe different indices.\n\nExample1's first output row is [1,0]. Row0's first element is1 (index0), row0's last element is0 (index4). So [1,0]. Then the second output row is [1,1], which is row4's first element1 and last element1. So maybe the output is taking the first and last elements of row0 and row4. But then Example0's output would be [0,2] and [2,0], but actual is [2,2] and [2,0]. Doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output rows are the first and last elements of the first and last non-middle rows. But this is vague.\n\nLooking back at the Test Input:\n\n[5,5,0,5,0]\n\n[0,5,0,0,5]\n\n[0,0,0,0,0]\n\n[5,5,0,5,5]\n\n[0,5,0,0,5]\n\nFollowing the pattern where the output is the last elements of the first two rows (rows0 and1) and then the last elements of rows3 and4.\n\nRow0 last element:0.\n\nRow1 last element:5.\n\nRow3 last element:5.\n\nRow4 last element:5.\n\nSo output would be [0,5] and [5,5]. But looking at the training examples, like Example1's output doesn't follow this, so this pattern might not be correct.\n\nAnother observation: In Example1's output, the first row is [1,0]. Looking at row0 of the input, which is [1,0,0,1,0], the first and fourth elements are 1 and1. But the output is 1 and0, which are the first and last elements of row0. Then the second output row is [1,1], which is the first and last of row4 [1,1,0,0,1]. So for Example0, the first output row is row0's first and last (0 and2) but the actual output is [2,2]. Doesn't fit.\n\nBut perhaps the output is the first and last elements of the first and fourth rows. For Example0, row0's first is0 and last is2; row4's first is2 and last is0. So combining them would give [0,2] and [2,0], but the output is [2,2] and [2,0]. So no.\n\nWait, Example2's output is [0,8] and [8,0]. Let's check row0 and row4. Row0's first is8, last is8. Row4's first is8, last is0. But output is [0,8] and [8,0]. Doesn't match. Hmm.\n\nAlternative approach: Let's think of the output as the first and last non-zero elements in the entire matrix. But that seems unlikely.\n\nWait, the output matrices in examples have elements that appear in the input matrices. For Example0, 2s and 0s. Example1 has 1s and 0s. So the output elements are present in the input. So the pattern likely involves selecting certain elements from specific positions.\n\nAnother observation: In each example, the output is a 2x2 matrix. The input is a 5x5 matrix with the middle row all zeros. So perhaps the output is formed by taking elements from the four corners of the input matrix. But let's see:\n\nIn Example0's input, the four corners are:\n\nTop-left:0, top-right:2, bottom-left:2, bottom-right:0. But the output is [2,2] and [2,0]. So no.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking elements from the non-zero rows. Let's consider that the middle row is ignored, and we have four rows (0,1,3,4). Then, pairing them into two groups (0 and1, 3 and4), and for each pair, taking certain elements.\n\nFor example, in Example0's pairs:\n\nRow0 and row1:\n\nTake the second element from each row. Row0's second element is2, row1's second is2 \u2192 [2,2].\n\nRow3 and row4: row3's second element is2, row4's second is2 \u2192 [2,2], but the output's second row is [2,0]. Doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, take the first element of the first row and the last element of the second row in each pair. For rows0 and1: first of 0 is0, last of row1 is2 \u2192 [0,2]. Doesn't match Example0's first output row.\n\nHmm. I'm stuck. Let me try to find another angle. Let's compare the Test Input to the examples and see what the output might be, then reverse-engineer.\n\nTest Input:\n\nRow0: [5,5,0,5,0]\n\nRow1: [0,5,0,0,5]\n\nRow2: all zeros.\n\nRow3: [5,5,0,5,5]\n\nRow4: [0,5,0,0,5]\n\nFollowing the possible pattern from Example0 and Example2, maybe the output is taking the last elements of rows0 and1, then rows3 and4. \n\nRow0 last element:0.\n\nRow1 last element:5.\n\nRow3 last element:5.\n\nRow4 last element:5.\n\nSo output would be [0,5] and [5,5]. But looking at the examples, especially Example2's output, which is [0,8] and [8,0], where the input rows3's last element is8, row4's last element is0. So why the difference?\n\nWait, in Example2's input:\n\nRow3: [8,8,0,8,8] \u2192 last element8.\n\nRow4: [8,0,0,8,0] \u2192 last element0.\n\nSo the output's second row is [8,0].\n\nBut in the Test Input, rows3 and4's last elements are5 and5. So according to that pattern, the output would be [5,5], but that's not seen in the examples.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by the first and last elements of the rows after the middle. For example, in Example0, rows3 and4:\n\nRow3: first element0, last element2.\n\nRow4: first element2, last element0.\n\nBut the output's second row is [2,0], which is the last elements of these two rows.\n\nWait, so perhaps the first output row is the last elements of the first two rows (rows0 and1), and the second output row is the last elements of the last two rows (rows3 and4). \n\nSo for Example0: rows0 and1 last elements are2 and2 \u2192 [2,2]. rows3 and4 last elements are2 and0 \u2192 [2,0]. Which matches.\n\nExample1:\n\nRows0 and1 last elements:0 and1 \u2192 [0,1]. rows3 and4 last elements:0 and1 \u2192 [0,1]. But the actual output is [1,0] and [1,1]. So this doesn't fit. \n\nSo this pattern works for Example0 and Example2 but not Example1.\n\nExample2's rows0 and1 last elements:8 and0 \u2192 output first row [0,8]? Wait, rows0's last is8, row1's last is0. So combining those would be [8,0], but the first output row is [0,8]. So maybe the order is reversed.\n\nWait, in Example2's output, first row is [0,8]. So perhaps it's row1's last element first, then row0's last. So 0 and8 \u2192 [0,8]. And for rows3 and4, last elements8 and0 \u2192 [8,0]. So that fits Example2's output. Then for Example0:\n\n rows0's last is2, row1's last is2 \u2192 [2,2]. rows3 and4's last elements2 and0 \u2192 [2,0]. Which matches. But in Example1, rows0 and1's last elements are0 and1 \u2192 [1,0] (reversed) and rows3 and4's last elements0 and1 \u2192 [1,1]. Which matches Example1's output. So the pattern would be:\n\nFor the first output row, take the last elements of row1 and row0 (reverse order), and for the second output row, take the last elements of row4 and row3 (reverse order). \n\nLet's verify:\n\nExample0:\n\nRow0 last:2, row1 last:2 \u2192 reversed \u21922,2 \u2192 first output row [2,2].\n\nRow3 last:2, row4 last:0 \u2192 reversed \u21920,2? No. Wait, rows3 and4 are row3 and row4. So their last elements are2 and0. But the output's second row is [2,0]. So maybe it's row3 and row4's last elements in original order.\n\nWait, this approach seems inconsistent. Let me check again.\n\nIn Example1:\n\nRow0 last element:0.\n\nRow1 last element:1.\n\nReversed \u21921,0 \u2192 first output row [1,0] \u2192 correct.\n\nRow3 last element:0.\n\nRow4 last element:1.\n\nReversed \u21921,0 \u2192 second output row [1,0]. But the actual output is [1,1]. So this doesn't fit.\n\nWait, no. Example1's rows3 and4:\n\nRow3 is [1,0,0,1,0] \u2192 last element0.\n\nRow4 is [1,1,0,0,1] \u2192 last element1.\n\nReversed would be 1 and0 \u2192 [1,0], but the actual output's second row is [1,1]. So this doesn't match.\n\nHmm. So this pattern works for Example0 and Example2 but not Example1. So perhaps the pattern is different.\n\nLooking back at Example1's output:\n\n[1,0]\n\n[1,1]\n\nRow0's last element is0. Row1's last is1. But output's first row is [1,0]. So perhaps it's the first element of row0 and the last element of row0. Row0 first is1, last is0 \u2192 [1,0]. Then row4's first is1 and last is1 \u2192 [1,1]. That fits.\n\nSo the pattern could be: for the first output row, take the first and last elements of the first non-zero row (row0). For the second output row, take the first and last elements of the last non-zero row (row4).\n\nLet's test this:\n\nExample0:\n\nRow0 first:0, last:2 \u2192 [0,2]. But output is [2,2]. Doesn't fit.\n\nNo. So this doesn't work.\n\nAlternatively, the first output row is first and last of row1, second output row is first and last of row3.\n\nExample0:\n\nRow1 first:2, last:2 \u2192 [2,2]. Row3 first:0, last:2 \u2192 [0,2]. But output's second row is [2,0]. No.\n\nNot matching.\n\nAlternative approach: Let's think of the output as the first and last elements of the two rows immediately above and below the all-zero middle row.\n\nIn Example0, rows1 and3. Row1's first and last are 2 and2. Row3's first and last are0 and2. So output rows [2,2] and [0,2]. But actual output is [2,2] and [2,0]. Not matching.\n\nHmm. I'm really stuck here. Let me try to look for another pattern.\n\nAnother observation: In each example, the output rows are the same as certain rows in the input, but modified. For example, in Example0's output, the first row is [2,2], which matches row1's first two elements [2,2]. The second output row is [2,0], which matches row4's first two elements [2,2,0,2,0] \u2192 [2,0] if taking first and last? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the output rows are the second and fourth elements of row1 and row3.\n\nExample0 row1: 2,2,0,2,2 \u2192 elements 2 and2 \u2192 [2,2]. Row3:0,2,0,2,2 \u2192 elements 2 and2 \u2192 [2,2]. But output's second row is [2,0]. No.\n\nAlternatively, output rows are the second and fourth elements of row1 and row4. Row1's second and fourth are 2 and2. Row4's second and fourth are2 and2. So [2,2], [2,2]. No.\n\nThis is getting frustrating. Maybe I should look for a pattern in the output elements' positions. For Example0's output [2,2], [2,0], perhaps it's the elements from the positions (1,4) and (1,4) of the first two rows. Wait, in 0-based indexing, row0's last element is index4:2. Row1's last element is2. So [2,2]. Then row3's last element2 and row4's last element0. So [2,0]. That matches.\n\nExample1's rows0 and1: last elements0 and1 \u2192 reversed to [1,0]. Rows3 and4: last elements0 and1 \u2192 reversed to [1,0], but actual output second row is [1,1]. Doesn't fit.\n\nWait, Example1's rows3 and4:\n\nRow3 last element is0, row4 last element is1. So [0,1]. But output is [1,1]. So that's not matching.\n\nAnother angle: Maybe the output is formed by taking the first element of the row below the middle and the last element of the row above the middle. For Example0:\n\nRow below middle (row3) first element0, row above middle (row1) last element2 \u2192 [0,2]. Doesn't match.\n\nAlternatively, the output is the diagonal elements of the upper and lower sections. For Example0, the upper part (rows0 and1) has a diagonal from row0's index4 (2) to row1's index0 (2) \u2192 [2,2]. Lower part (rows3 and4) has row3's index0 (0) and row4's index4 (0) \u2192 [0,0]. Not matching.\n\nThis is really tricky. Let's think of another approach. The output is 2x2. The input is 5x5. The middle row is all zeros, which likely serves as a separator. So perhaps the output is combining elements from the top two rows and the bottom two rows.\n\nFor Example0's top two rows:\n\nRow0:0,2,0,0,2\n\nRow1:2,2,0,2,2\n\nMaybe the output's first row is the sum of these two rows, but only taking the first and last elements. Sum of first elements:0+2=2, sum of last elements:2+2=4. But output is [2,2]. Not matching.\n\nAlternatively, the maximum of the first elements and the maximum of the last elements. For rows0 and1: max(0,2)=2, max(2,2)=2 \u2192 [2,2]. For rows3 and4: max(0,2)=2, max(2,0)=2. But output's second row is [2,0]. So no.\n\nAnother thought: The output rows are the first and last elements of the first non-zero row after the middle and the first non-zero row before the middle. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the elements at positions (1,1) and (1,3) from the top rows and (3,1) and (3,3) from the bottom rows. For Example0, row1's (1,1) is2, row1's (1,3) is2 \u2192 [2,2]. Row3's (3,1) is2, row3's (3,3) is2 \u2192 [2,2], but output's second row is [2,0]. Doesn't fit.\n\nI'm really stuck. Maybe I should try to see what the Test Input's output would be based on the previous examples and see if there's a pattern.\n\nTest Input:\n\nRow0: [5,5,0,5,0]\n\nRow1: [0,5,0,0,5]\n\nRow3: [5,5,0,5,5]\n\nRow4: [0,5,0,0,5]\n\nIf we follow Example0's pattern of taking the last elements of rows0 and1 (0 and5), then rows3 and4 (5 and5). So output would be [0,5] and [5,5]. But looking at Example2's output where the first output row is [0,8], which is the last elements of row1 and row0 (row1's last is0, row0's last is8). So [0,8]. Then rows3 and4's last elements are8 and0 \u2192 [8,0]. So for Test Input:\n\n rows0's last is0, row1's last is5 \u2192 reversed to [5,0]. Then rows3's last is5, row4's last is5 \u2192 [5,5]. But I'm not sure if this reversal is the case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the first output row is row1's last element and row0's last element. For Test Input: row1's last is5, row0's last is0 \u2192 [5,0]. Second output row is row4's last (5) and row3's last (5) \u2192 [5,5]. But I don't see any examples with this exact pattern.\n\nAlternatively, looking at Example1's output, where the first output row is [1,0], which is row0's first and last elements (1 and0), and the second row is row4's first and last (1 and1). So for Test Input:\n\n row0's first and last:5 and0 \u2192 [5,0]. row4's first and last:0 and5 \u2192 [0,5]. So output would be [5,0] and [0,5]. But I don't know if this is correct.\n\nBut in Example2's output, the first row is [0,8], which is row1's first element (8) and row0's last (8) reversed? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the first element of the second row and the last element of the first row. For Example0, row1's first is2, row0's last is2 \u2192 [2,2]. Then row4's first is2, row3's last is2 \u2192 [2,2]. But actual output's second row is [2,0]. Doesn't fit.\n\nAnother possible pattern: The output is the first element of the row after the middle and the last element of the row before the middle. For Example0:\n\nAfter middle: row3, first element0. Before middle: row1, last element2. So [0,2]. Doesn't match output.\n\nI'm really not seeing the pattern here. Maybe I need to look for something else, like the sum of certain elements modulo something. But the examples don't show any arithmetic operations.\n\nWait, in Example0's output, the first row has two 2s. Looking at the input's first two rows, perhaps there's a connection to the number of occurrences. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the output is the unique non-zero elements in the input. But Example0's input has 0 and2. Output has 2 and0. But that's just the same elements. So that doesn't help.\n\nAnother observation: In each example, the output's first element is the same as the last element of the second row. For Example0, output's first element is2, which is row1's last element. Example1's first output element is1, which is row1's last element (1). Example2's first output element is0, which is row1's last element (0). Then the second element of the first output row is the last element of row0. Example0's row0's last element is2 \u2192 output is [2,2]. Example1's row0's last element is0 \u2192 output first row [1,0]. Example2's row0's last is8, row1's last is0 \u2192 output first row [0,8]. So the first output row is [row1's last, row0's last]. The second output row is [row4's last, row3's last]. Let's verify:\n\nExample0:\n\n row1's last:2, row0's last:2 \u2192 [2,2]. row4's last:0, row3's last:2 \u2192 [0,2]. But output's second row is [2,0]. So this doesn't fit. Unless it's reversed. row3's last is2, row4's last is0 \u2192 [2,0]. Oh! Maybe the second output row is [row3's last, row4's last]. Then for Example0: row3's last is2, row4's last is0 \u2192 [2,0]. Which matches. Example1:\n\n row1's last:1, row0's last:0 \u2192 [1,0]. row3's last:0, row4's last:1 \u2192 [0,1]. But the actual output's second row is [1,1]. So this doesn't fit.\n\nExample2:\n\n row1's last:0, row0's last:8 \u2192 [0,8]. row3's last:8, row4's last:0 \u2192 [8,0]. Which matches Example2's output.\n\nTest Input:\n\n row1's last:5, row0's last:0 \u2192 [5,0]. row3's last:5, row4's last:5 \u2192 [5,5]. So output would be [5,0] and [5,5]. But looking at the examples, like Example1's output should be [1,0] and [0,1] but it's [1,0] and [1,1]. So this pattern only works for Example0 and Example2, but not Example1.\n\nSo what's different in Example1?\n\nExample1's output second row is [1,1]. According to the pattern, it should be row3's last and row4's last. Row3's last is0, row4's last is1 \u2192 [0,1]. But actual output is [1,1]. So this pattern doesn't hold for Example1. \n\nThis inconsistency suggests that there's another layer to the pattern. Maybe it's dependent on the values in the rows. For example, if the row starts with a certain value, it's treated differently. \n\nLooking at Example1's input rows3 and4:\n\nRow3: [1,0,0,1,0] \u2192 last element0.\n\nRow4: [1,1,0,0,1] \u2192 last element1.\n\nBut the output's second row is [1,1]. Hmm. So perhaps in this case, the output is taking the first element of row4 (1) and the last element of row4 (1), ignoring row3. But why?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output's second row is the first element of row3 and the last element of row4. For Example1, row3's first is1, row4's last is1 \u2192 [1,1], which matches. So the pattern could be:\n\nFirst output row: [row1's last, row0's last]\n\nSecond output row: [row3's first, row4's last]\n\nTesting this:\n\nExample0:\n\n row1's last:2, row0's last:2 \u2192 [2,2]\n\n row3's first:0, row4's last:0 \u2192 [0,0]. But actual output's second row is [2,0]. Doesn't fit.\n\nExample2:\n\n row1's last:0, row0's last:8 \u2192 [0,8]\n\n row3's first:8, row4's last:0 \u2192 [8,0]. Which matches.\n\nExample1:\n\n row1's last:1, row0's last:0 \u2192 [1,0]\n\n row3's first:1, row4's last:1 \u2192 [1,1]. Which matches.\n\nTest Input:\n\n row1's last:5, row0's last:0 \u2192 [5,0]\n\n row3's first:5, row4's last:5 \u2192 [5,5]. So output would be [5,0] and [5,5]. But looking at the examples, this seems plausible. But let's check Example0's second row:\n\n row3's first is0, row4's last is0 \u2192 [0,0]. But the actual output's second row is [2,0]. So this doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. So this pattern works for Example1 and Example2, but not Example0.\n\nBut maybe there's a different pattern for each example. This is getting too complicated. Perhaps the correct pattern is that the first output row is the last elements of row1 and row0, and the second output row is the first element of row3 and the last element of row4. Which works for Example1 and Example2, but not Example0. Or perhaps the pattern is different based on whether certain elements are zero.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider that the output is formed by taking the first and last elements of the first non-zero row after the middle and the last non-zero row before the middle.\n\nWait, I'm running out of ideas. Given the time I've spent, perhaps the correct pattern is to take the last elements of the first two rows (row0 and row1) and reverse them for the first output row, then take the last elements of the last two rows (row3 and row4) and reverse them for the second output row. \n\nFor Example0:\n\n row0 last:2, row1 last:2 \u2192 reversed \u2192 [2,2]. rows3 and4 last:2,0 \u2192 reversed \u2192 [0,2]. But output's second row is [2,0]. So this doesn't fit.\n\nExample1:\n\n row0 last:0, row1 last:1 \u2192 reversed \u2192 [1,0]. rows3 and4 last:0,1 \u2192 reversed \u2192 [1,0]. But output's second row is [1,1]. Doesn't fit.\n\nExample2:\n\n row0 last:8, row1 last:0 \u2192 reversed \u2192 [0,8]. rows3 and4 last:8,0 \u2192 reversed \u2192 [0,8]. But output's second row is [8,0]. So no.\n\nThis approach isn't working.\n\nFinal idea: Maybe the output is the non-zero elements from the first and fourth columns of the first and fourth rows. \n\nFor Example0:\n\n row0 and row3:\n\n row0 first:0, fourth:0 \u2192 non-zero? No. row3 first:0, fourth:2. So maybe [0,2]. But output's first row is [2,2].\n\nNot helpful.\n\nAfter struggling for a long time, I think the correct pattern is that the output consists of the last elements of row1 and row0 (in reverse order) for the first row, and the last elements of row4 and row3 (reverse order) for the second row. Let's verify:\n\nExample0:\n\n row1 last:2, row0 last:2 \u2192 reversed \u2192 [2,2]. row4 last:0, row3 last:2 \u2192 reversed \u2192 [2,0]. So output is [2,2] and [2,0]. Which matches.\n\nExample1:\n\n row1 last:1, row0 last:0 \u2192 reversed \u2192 [0,1]. But output's first row is [1,0]. So no.\n\nExample2:\n\n row1 last:0, row0 last:8 \u2192 reversed \u2192 [8,0]. But output's first row is [0,8]. So this doesn't fit.\n\nWait, no. If reversed, row0 and row1's last elements. For Example0, row0's last is2, row1's last is2 \u2192 reversed would be 2,2. But they are the same. For Example1, row0's last is0, row1's last is1 \u2192 reversed is1,0 \u2192 which matches Example1's first output row. For Example2, row0's last is8, row1's last is0 \u2192 reversed is0,8 \u2192 which matches Example2's first output row. Then, for the second output row, row4's last and row3's last reversed.\n\nExample0's row4's last is0, row3's last is2 \u2192 reversed is2,0 \u2192 matches second output row.\n\nExample1's row4's last is1, row3's last is0 \u2192 reversed is0,1 \u2192 but the output's second row is [1,1]. Doesn't fit.\n\nExample2's row4's last is0, row3's last is8 \u2192 reversed is8,0 \u2192 matches the second output row.\n\nTest Input:\n\n row0's last is0, row1's last is5 \u2192 reversed \u21925,0. So first output row [5,0].\n\n row4's last is5, row3's last is5 \u2192 reversed \u21925,5. So second output row [5,5].\n\n But according to Example1's output, this pattern would require the second row to be reversed row4 and row3's last elements. For Example1, row3's last is0, row4's last is1 \u2192 reversed [1,0], but the actual output's second row is [1,1]. So this doesn't fit for Example1.\n\nTherefore, this pattern works for Example0, Example2, and the Test Input, but not Example1. However, Example1's output is [1,0] and [1,1]. The first row fits the pattern (row0's last is0, row1's last is1 \u2192 reversed [1,0]). The second row is [1,1], which would require row4's last and row3's last to be1 and1. But row3's last is0, row4's last is1 \u2192 reversed [1,0], which doesn't match. So there's a discrepancy.\n\nBut looking at Example1's input rows3 and4:\n\nRow3: [1,0,0,1,0] \u2192 last element0.\n\nRow4: [1,1,0,0,1] \u2192 last element1.\n\nIf the second output row is row4's last and row3's last \u2192 [1,0], but the output is [1,1]. So this doesn't fit.\n\nBut maybe in Example1, there's another rule. Perhaps when the row has a certain pattern, the first element is taken instead. For Example1's second output row [1,1], maybe it's the first elements of row3 and row4. Row3's first is1, row4's first is1 \u2192 [1,1]. Which matches.\n\nSo maybe the pattern is:\n\n- First output row: reversed last elements of row0 and row1 \u2192 [row1's last, row0's last].\n\n- Second output row: first elements of row3 and row4.\n\nBut let's test this:\n\nExample0:\n\n row3's first:0, row4's first:2 \u2192 [0,2]. But output's second row is [2,0]. Doesn't fit.\n\nExample1:\n\n row3's first:1, row4's first:1 \u2192 [1,1]. Which matches.\n\nExample2:\n\n row3's first:8, row4's first:8 \u2192 [8,8]. But output's second row is [8,0]. Doesn't fit.\n\nSo this doesn't work.\n\nAnother possibility: For the second output row, it's the first element of row3 and the last element of row4. For Example0, row3's first:0, row4's last:0 \u2192 [0,0]. No. Example1, row3's first:1, row4's last:1 \u2192 [1,1]. Which matches. Example2: row3's first:8, row4's last:0 \u2192 [8,0]. Which matches. Test Input: row3's first:5, row4's last:5 \u2192 [5,5]. So the second output row would be [5,5].\n\nSo combining:\n\nFirst output row: [row1's last, row0's last].\n\nSecond output row: [row3's first, row4's last].\n\nExample0:\n\n row1's last:2, row0's last:2 \u2192 [2,2].\n\n row3's first:0, row4's last:0 \u2192 [0,0]. But output's second row is [2,0]. Doesn't fit.\n\nExample1:\n\n row1's last:1, row0's last:0 \u2192 [1,0].\n\n row3's first:1, row4's last:1 \u2192 [1,1]. Which matches.\n\nExample2:\n\n row1's last:0, row0's last:8 \u2192 [0,8].\n\n row3's first:8, row4's last:0 \u2192 [8,0]. Which matches.\n\nTest Input:\n\n row1's last:5, row0's last:0 \u2192 [5,0].\n\n row3's first:5, row4's last:5 \u2192 [5,5]. So output would be [5,0] and [5,5].\n\nBut Example0's output doesn't fit this pattern, so it's inconsistent. \n\nHowever, the training examples show that Example0 and Example2 follow this pattern, while Example1 might have a different rule. But since the Test Input follows the same structure as the training examples, perhaps this pattern is the one to use despite the inconsistency with Example0.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a mistake in my analysis. Let me re-examine Example0's input:\n\nRow3's first element is0, row4's last element is0. So according to the pattern, the second output row should be [0,0], but the actual output is [2,0]. So this contradicts the pattern.\n\nBut in Example0's input, row3 is [0,2,0,2,2], and row4 is [2,2,0,2,0]. So row3's first element is0, row4's last is0. But the output's second row is [2,0]. So this suggests the pattern isn't based on row3's first and row4's last.\n\nAnother observation: In Example0's output second row [2,0], 2 is the last element of row3, and 0 is the last element of row4. So it's [row3's last, row4's last]. \n\nFor Example0:\n\n row3's last:2, row4's last:0 \u2192 [2,0]. Which matches.\n\nExample1:\n\n row3's last:0, row4's last:1 \u2192 [0,1]. But output is [1,1]. Doesn't fit.\n\nExample2:\n\n row3's last:8, row4's last:0 \u2192 [8,0]. Which matches.\n\nTest Input:\n\n row3's last:5, row4's last:5 \u2192 [5,5].\n\nSo if the pattern is:\n\nFirst output row: [row1's last, row0's last]\n\nSecond output row: [row3's last, row4's last]\n\nThen:\n\nExample0's output would be [2,2] and [2,0]. Correct.\n\nExample1's output would be [1,0] and [0,1]. But actual output is [1,0] and [1,1]. Doesn't fit.\n\nExample2's output would be [0,8] and [8,0]. Correct.\n\nTest Input's output would be [5,0] and [5,5].\n\nBut this doesn't explain Example1's output. So why is Example1's second row [1,1]?\n\nLooking at Example1's input row4: [1,1,0,0,1]. The last element is1. Row3's last element is0. So according to the pattern, the second output row would be [0,1]. But the actual output is [1,1]. So this doesn't fit.\n\nBut perhaps in Example1, the second output row is taking the first elements of row3 and row4. Row3's first is1, row4's first is1 \u2192 [1,1]. Which matches. So maybe the pattern is:\n\n- First output row: [row1's last, row0's last]\n\n- Second output row: [row3's first, row4's first]\n\nThis would fit:\n\nExample0:\n\n row3's first:0, row4's first:2 \u2192 [0,2]. But output's second row is [2,0]. Doesn't fit.\n\nExample1:\n\n row3's first:1, row4's first:1 \u2192 [1,1]. Which matches.\n\nExample2:\n\n row3's first:8, row4's first:8 \u2192 [8,8]. But output's second row is [8,0]. Doesn't fit.\n\nSo this only works for Example1.\n\nThis inconsistency suggests that there's a different pattern for each example, which is unlikely. The correct pattern must be consistent across all examples.\n\nAfter extensive analysis, the only pattern that seems to work for all examples is:\n\nFirst output row: [row1's last element, row0's last element]\n\nSecond output row: [row3's last element, row4's last element]\n\nBut this works for Example0, Example2, and Test Input, but not Example1. Example1's second output row would be [0,1], but actual is [1,1]. So this is a problem. But perhaps in Example1, the second output row is the first elements of row3 and row4. Which are both1. So maybe the pattern is:\n\nWhen the row3's last element is zero, the second output row takes the first elements of row3 and row4.\n\nBut this is too specific and there's no indication of such a condition in the examples.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and the possible time constraints, I'll have to make a educated guess based on the majority pattern. Since two out of three training examples fit the pattern of first row being [row1's last, row0's last] and second row being [row3's last, row4's last], I'll proceed with that for the Test Input.\n\nFor the Test Input:\n\nRow1's last element:5.\n\nRow0's last element:0.\n\nRow3's last element:5.\n\nRow4's last element:5.\n\nSo the output would be:\n\n[5,0]\n\n[5,5]\n\nBut looking at Example1's output, this pattern doesn't fit, so I'm uncertain. However, given the time invested, I'll proceed with this answer.",

        "cot_2": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. So, the problem gives me some input matrices and their corresponding outputs. I need to find out what transformation is happening from the input to the output and then apply that to the test input.\n\nLooking at the training examples:\n\nStarting with Example 0. The input is a 5x5 matrix. The output is a 2x2 matrix. Let's see how the input maps to the output.\n\nOriginal Input (Example 0):\nRow 0: [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]\nRow 1: [2, 2, 0, 2, 2]\nRow 2: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\nRow 3: [0, 2, 0, 2, 2]\nRow 4: [2, 2, 0, 2, 0]\n\nOutput:\n[2, 2]\n[2, 0]\n\nHmm. The output is smaller. Maybe each 2x2 block in the input is being processed into a single value in the output? But how?\n\nWait, the output here is 2 rows. The input has 5 rows. Maybe the input is divided into two parts, like top and bottom, and each part is processed into a row of the output. Let me check.\n\nLooking at the rows of the input. The first two rows (0 and 1) might form the first part. Then the next two rows (3 and 4) would form the second part. Wait, but row 2 is all zeros. Maybe that's a middle row acting as a separator? Let's check other examples.\n\nExample 1's input has row 2 all zeros as well. Similarly for Example 2. So perhaps the input is split into two 2x5 sections above and below the middle zero row, and each is transformed into a row of the output.\n\nBut the output rows are of length 2. So maybe each of the two sections (top two rows and bottom two rows) is being transformed into a 2-element array.\n\nHow does that happen?\n\nLooking at Example 0's output. The first output row is [2,2]. Let's look at the top two input rows:\n\nRow 0: [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]\nRow 1: [2, 2, 0, 2, 2]\n\nWhat's the pattern here to get [2,2] as the output? Maybe taking the maximum value in certain columns? Let's see. The output has two elements. The top input rows are two rows. Let's see the columns:\n\nColumns 0: 0 and 2 \u2192 max is 2 \u2192 first element.\nBut the output is [2,2]. Wait, maybe columns 1 and 4?\n\nRow 0's column 1 is 2, column 4 is 2.\nRow 1's column 1 is 2, column 4 is 2.\nBut how does that combine? The output's first row is [2,2]. If they are taking the first and last elements of the first two rows? Or maybe the sum?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the top two rows are divided into two 2x2 blocks. For example:\n\nRow 0 and 1: take the first two elements as the first block, next two as the next, etc. But the output is two elements. Maybe taking the sum or max of each row pair's first and last elements.\n\nWait, in Example 0's top two rows:\n\nRow 0: 0,2,0,0,2 \u2192 first element 0, last element 2.\nRow 1: 2,2,0,2,2 \u2192 first 2, last 2.\n\nIf we take the sum or something. If for each of the top two rows, we take first and last elements and combine them. But the output is two elements. Maybe for each of the top two rows, take their first element and the next row's last element?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is combining elements from the first two rows and the last two rows in a specific way.\n\nWait, the output in Example 0 is two rows, each with two elements. Let's look at the output rows:\n\nFirst output row [2,2], second [2,0].\n\nLooking at the top two input rows (0 and 1). Let's see: maybe the first element of the output row is the value from row 0, column 1 (which is 2), and the second element is the value from row 1, column 4 (which is 2). Then the first output row would be [2, 2]. Then for the bottom two rows (3 and 4), row 3's column 1 is 2, row 4's column 4 is 0. So [2,0], which matches the output. That could be a pattern.\n\nTesting this for Example 1.\n\nExample 1's input:\n\nRow 0: [1, 0, 0, 1, 0]\nRow 1: [0, 1, 0, 0, 1]\nMiddle row (2) is all zeros.\nRow 3: [1, 0, 0, 1, 0]\nRow 4: [1, 1, 0, 0, 1]\n\nThe output is [1,0] and [1,1].\n\nFor the first output row: take row 0's column 1 (0) and row 1's column 4 (1). But the output is [1,0]. Wait, maybe the order is reversed. Or maybe row 0's column 0 and row 1's column 4?\n\nRow 0's column 0 is 1, row 1's column 4 is 1. But the first output row is [1,0]. Hmm. That doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe row 0's column 1 and row 1's column 3. Row 0 col1 is 0, row 1 col3 is 0. No.\n\nWait, maybe taking row 0's column 4 and row 1's column 0? For the first output element. Row 0's 4th element is 0, row 1's 0th is 0. No.\n\nWait in the output of Example 1, the first output row is [1,0]. Let me check the top two rows again. Row 0 is [1,0,0,1,0], row 1 is [0,1,0,0,1].\n\nWhat if the first element of the output row is the first non-zero element in row 0? Row 0 starts with 1, so first non-zero is 1. The second element is the last non-zero in row 1. Row 1's last element is 1, but the output is 0. Hmm, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the positions of non-zero elements. Maybe the output rows are taking the first and last non-zero elements from the top two rows and the bottom two rows?\n\nIn Example 0's top two rows:\n\nRow 0: [0,2,0,0,2]. Non-zero elements are at 1 and 4. The first non-zero is 2 (position 1), last is 2 (position 4).\nRow 1: [2,2,0,2,2]. Non-zero elements are 0,1,3,4. First is 2 (pos0), last is 2 (pos4).\n\nBut how do these combine into [2,2]? Maybe the first non-zero of row 0 and the last non-zero of row 1? So 2 (from row0, first non-zero) and 2 (from row1's last). Which would be 2 and 2. Then that matches the first output row [2,2].\n\nThen for the bottom two rows (rows 3 and 4 in example 0):\n\nRow3: [0,2,0,2,2]. First non-zero is 2 (pos1), row4: [2,2,0,2,0]. Last non-zero is 2 (pos3). Wait, but the output row is [2,0]. Hmm, that doesn't fit. Because row4's last non-zero is at pos3 (value 2), but the output's second element is 0.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is combining the first non-zero of the first row in the pair and the last non-zero of the second row in the pair.\n\nWait for the bottom two rows in example 0:\n\nRows3 and 4. The pair is row3 and row4. So first non-zero in row3 is 2 (pos1), last non-zero in row4 is 0? Wait row4 is [2,2,0,2,0]. The last non-zero is at pos3 (value 2). So output should be 2 and 2? But actual output is [2,0]. Hmm, maybe not.\n\nThis approach may not be working. Let's think differently.\n\nAnother approach: The input has 5 rows. The output has 2 rows, each with 2 elements. Maybe the output is constructed by taking elements from specific positions in the input.\n\nLooking at the first output row of Example 0: [2,2]. Let's look at the input. Maybe the elements are from row1, column0 and row1, column4. Because row1 has 2,2,0,2,2. So 2 and 2. That would give the first output row. Then the second output row [2,0] could be from row4, column0 (2) and row4, column4 (0). So 2 and 0. But why those positions?\n\nBut in Example 1, the first output row is [1,0]. Let's check.\n\nExample1 input rows 0 and1:\n\nRow0:1,0,0,1,0 \u2192 perhaps if the first element of the output is row0's first element (1), and the second element is row1's last element (1). But the output is [1,0]. That doesn't fit. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output rows are made from the middle columns of the top two and bottom two rows. For example, looking at columns 2 (middle) in the input. Wait, the input has 5 columns, so middle is column2. But in example0, the output's first element is 2. Column2 for rows0 and1 are 0 and0, which doesn't help.\n\nAlternative idea: Perhaps the output is taking the first and last elements of the first and last rows of the input's top and bottom sections.\n\nThe input is split into two parts by the all-zero row. The top part is rows0 and1. The bottom part is rows3 and4. For each part, process them into a row of the output.\n\nSo for the top part (rows0 and1), perhaps take some combination of elements. For example, the first element of row0 and the last element of row1. Let's check example0's top part:\n\nRow0's first element is 0, row1's last element is 2. That would be 0 and2. But the output's first row is [2,2]. Doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the sum of the first elements of rows0 and1. 0+2=2. Then sum of last elements: 2+2=4. But the output is [2,2], which is maybe taking the sum mod something? Not sure.\n\nAnother angle: The output's rows have two elements each. Perhaps each element in the output is derived from a pair of elements in the input's corresponding section. For example, for the top two rows, perhaps the first element of the output is the sum of the first elements of rows0 and1, and the second element is the sum of the last elements of rows0 and1.\n\nIn example0's top section:\n\nRow0:0,2,0,0,2 \u2192 first element 0, last 2.\nRow1:2,2,0,2,2 \u2192 first 2, last 2.\n\nSum of first elements: 0+2=2. Sum of last elements:2+2=4. But the output is [2,2], which would require 2 and 2. So that doesn't match unless maybe taking max instead of sum. Max of first elements is 2, max of last is 2. That would give [2,2]. Then for the bottom section:\n\nRows3 and4:\n\nRow3:0,2,0,2,2 \u2192 first 0, last 2.\nRow4:2,2,0,2,0 \u2192 first 2, last 0.\n\nMax of first elements: max(0,2)=2. Max of last elements: max(2,0)=2. But the output is [2,0], which doesn't fit. Hmm.\n\nWait, example0's bottom output row is [2,0]. If instead, we take the first element from row3's first element (0) and row4's first element (2), maybe taking the max gives 2. Then the second element is the last element of row3 (2) and row4 (0) \u2192 max is 2, but output is 0. Not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the sum, but then 0+2=2 and 2+0=2. Output would be [2,2], but the actual output is [2,0]. So this approach is not working.\n\nLet me check example2.\n\nExample2 input:\n\nRows0:8,8,0,0,8\nRow1:8,0,0,8,0\nRow2: all zeros.\nRow3:8,8,0,8,8\nRow4:8,0,0,8,0\n\nOutput:\n[0,8]\n[8,0]\n\nSo for the top two rows (0 and1):\n\nRow0:8,8,0,0,8 \u2192 first element 8, last 8.\nRow1:8,0,0,8,0 \u2192 first 8, last 0.\n\nIf the output's first row is [0,8], how does that come from these?\n\nHmm, maybe the output elements are the second and fourth elements of some row. Let's see:\n\nIn example2's output first row [0,8]. Looking at the top two rows. Maybe row0's second element (8) and row1's fourth (8). But that would be 8 and8. Not matching 0 and8.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the third elements. Row0's third element is 0, row1's third is 0. But output has 0 and8.\n\nAnother idea: The output is formed by the elements in the middle of the top and bottom sections. Wait, since the input is split into two parts, each part has two rows. Maybe for each part, we look at the elements around the middle column (column2). For example, the elements to the left and right of the middle.\n\nIn example0's top section (rows0 and1):\n\nRow0: [0,2,0,0,2]\nMiddle column (index2) is 0. The elements to the left and right are 2 (index1) and 0 (index3). But output is [2,2]. Not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe for each section (top and bottom), take the elements from the middle row's left and right. But since each section has two rows, maybe the middle of those two rows. For example, the first element of the first row and the last element of the second row in the section.\n\nFor example0's top section (rows0 and1):\n\nRow0's first element is 0, row1's last is 2. But output is [2,2]. Not matching.\n\nAlternatively, row0's last element (2) and row1's first element (2). Then the output row would be [2,2], which matches example0's first output row. Then for the bottom section (rows3 and4):\n\nRow3's first element is 0, row4's last element is 0. So combining them would be 0 and0. But the output is [2,0]. Hmm, not matching.\n\nWait, in example0's bottom section, rows3 and4:\n\nRow3: [0,2,0,2,2]\nRow4: [2,2,0,2,0]\n\nIf we take row3's first element (0) and row4's last element (0), that's [0,0], but output is [2,0]. So maybe another approach.\n\nLet me think of the output as 2x2 matrix. Each element corresponds to a quadrant of the input, but the input is 5x5. Alternatively, perhaps the output is derived by looking at certain diagonals.\n\nIn example0, the output is [2,2] and [2,0]. Let's see. Maybe the first element is the sum of the diagonal elements in the top-left section. For example:\n\nTop section (rows0 and1, columns0-2 and 2-4? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, for the top two rows, take the first two elements of row0 and the last two elements of row1. But how to combine them into two elements.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is taking the maximum (or some operation) of the first and last elements of each row in the section.\n\nFor example0's top section:\n\nRow0 first element 0, last 2 \u2192 max 2 (since 0 and2, maybe considering non-zero values). Row1 first 2, last 2 \u2192 max 2. So output first row [2,2]. Then for the bottom section:\n\nRow3 first 0, last 2 \u2192 max 2? Row4 first 2, last 0 \u2192 max 2. But output is [2,0]. That doesn't fit.\n\nHmm, maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the positions where the elements are non-zero and taking the count. But example0's first output row is [2,2], which could be the count of non-zero in certain columns. Not sure.\n\nWait, in example0's output rows: the first row is [2,2], the second [2,0]. Maybe the output elements are the number of times a certain value appears in each quadrant of the input. For example, split the input into four quadrants (excluding the middle row and column), but since the input is 5x5, the middle is row2 and column2. Then the quadrants would be top-left (rows0-1, columns0-1), top-right (rows0-1, columns3-4), bottom-left (rows3-4, columns0-1), bottom-right (rows3-4, columns3-4). Then count the number of 2's in each quadrant.\n\nTop-left quadrant (rows0-1, cols0-1):\n\nRow0:0,2 \u2192 elements 0,2 \u2192 1 occurrence of 2.\n\nRow1:2,2 \u2192 two 2's. Total 3. But output is 2, so maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, sum them. 0+2 + 2+2 = 6. Not matching output 2.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is formed by taking the first and last elements of the first and last rows of each section. For the top section (rows0 and1):\n\nFirst element of row0 is 0, last of row1 is 2. So [0,2] but output is [2,2]. Not matching.\n\nAlternatively, the maximum of the first elements of the two rows and the maximum of the last elements.\n\nRow0's first element 0, row1's first 2 \u2192 max 2.\n\nRow0's last 2, row1's last 2 \u2192 max 2. So output [2,2]. That matches the first row of example0's output.\n\nThen for the bottom section (rows3 and4):\n\nRow3's first 0, row4's first 2 \u2192 max 2.\n\nRow3's last 2, row4's last 0 \u2192 max 2. But example0's output for the bottom row is [2,0], which doesn't fit. So this approach doesn't work.\n\nBut in example0's bottom output row, the second element is 0, which is row4's last element. So maybe for the first element of the output row, take the max of the first elements of the two rows in the section, and the second element is the min of the last elements of the two rows.\n\nFor example0's bottom section:\n\nMax of first elements (0 and2) \u2192 2.\n\nMin of last elements (2 and0) \u2192 0. So output [2,0], which matches.\n\nLet's test this for example1.\n\nExample1's top section (rows0 and1):\n\nRow0:1,0,0,1,0 \u2192 first element 1, last 0.\n\nRow1:0,1,0,0,1 \u2192 first 0, last 1.\n\nMax of first elements (1 and0) \u21921.\n\nMin of last elements (0 and1) \u21920. So output row [1,0], which matches example1's first output row.\n\nFor the bottom section (rows3 and4):\n\nRow3:1,0,0,1,0 \u2192 first 1, last 0.\n\nRow4:1,1,0,0,1 \u2192 first 1, last 1.\n\nMax of first elements (1 and1) \u21921.\n\nMin of last elements (0 and1) \u21920. So output [1,0]. But example1's output for the bottom row is [1,1]. So this doesn't fit. Hmm, so maybe this isn't the pattern.\n\nWait, example1's output is:\n\n[1,0]\n[1,1]\n\nSo the bottom row of the output is [1,1]. If we take the max of the first elements (1 and1) \u21921. The min of the last elements (0 and1) \u21920. But the output is [1,1]. So that's not matching.\n\nAlternative idea: Maybe the output is the first element of the first row in the section and the last element of the second row in the section.\n\nFor example0's top section: row0's first element (0), row1's last element (2). Output [0,2], but example0's output is [2,2]. No.\n\nAlternatively, the second row's first element and the first row's last element. For example0's top section: row1's first is 2, row0's last is 2. So [2,2]. Which matches. Then for the bottom section, rows3 and4: row4's first is 2, row3's last is2. So output [2,2], but example0's output is [2,0]. Doesn't fit.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternative approach: Looking for the positions of non-zero elements in each section.\n\nIn example0's top section:\n\nRows0 and1. Let's list all non-zero elements.\n\nRow0: 2 (index1), 2 (index4).\n\nRow1: 2 (index0), 2 (index1), 2 (index3), 2 (index4).\n\nLooking for the first and last non-zero elements across both rows. The first non-zero in the top section is row0's index1 (2). The last non-zero in the top section is row1's index4 (2). So the output row would be [2,2], which matches.\n\nFor the bottom section (rows3 and4):\n\nRow3:2 (index1), 2 (index3), 2 (index4).\n\nRow4:2 (index0), 2 (index1), 2 (index3).\n\nFirst non-zero in the bottom section is row3's index1 (2) or row4's index0 (2). Wait, which comes first? The first row in the section is row3. So row3's elements come first. So first non-zero in row3 is index1 (2). Last non-zero in the section is row4's index3 (2). But the output for the bottom row is [2,0]. So that doesn't fit.\n\nHmm, maybe it's the first non-zero in the first row of the section and the last non-zero in the second row of the section.\n\nFor example0's bottom section:\n\nFirst row of the section is row3. First non-zero is index1 (2).\n\nSecond row is row4. Last non-zero is index3 (2). So output would be [2,2], but the actual output is [2,0]. Doesn't fit.\n\nWait, but row4's last non-zero is at index3 (value 2), but row4 is [2,2,0,2,0]. So the last element is 0. So perhaps the last element of the second row in the section. For example0's bottom section's second row (row4) has last element 0. So output would be [2,0], which matches. So the pattern could be:\n\nFor each section (top and bottom), take the first non-zero element from the first row of the section and the last element from the second row of the section.\n\nLet's test this.\n\nExample0's top section:\n\nFirst row (row0): first non-zero is 2 at index1.\n\nSecond row (row1): last element is 2. So output [2,2]. Correct.\n\nExample0's bottom section:\n\nFirst row (row3): first non-zero is 2 at index1.\n\nSecond row (row4): last element is 0. So output [2,0]. Correct.\n\nExample1's top section:\n\nFirst row (row0): first non-zero is 1 at index0.\n\nSecond row (row1): last element is 1. So output [1,1]. But example1's first output row is [1,0]. Doesn't fit. Hmm.\n\nWait, but in example1's top section:\n\nRow0: [1,0,0,1,0]. First non-zero is 1 (index0).\n\nRow1: [0,1,0,0,1]. Last element is 1. So according to this pattern, output should be [1,1]. But actual output is [1,0]. So this doesn't fit.\n\nHmm, maybe the last element of the second row is not considered, but something else.\n\nAlternative idea: For each section, take the first non-zero element of the first row and the first non-zero element of the second row.\n\nExample0's top section:\n\nRow0's first non-zero:2 (index1).\n\nRow1's first non-zero:2 (index0). So output [2,2]. Correct.\n\nBottom section:\n\nRow3's first non-zero:2 (index1).\n\nRow4's first non-zero:2 (index0). So output [2,2], but example0's output is [2,0]. So no.\n\nAnother approach: For each section, take the first element of the first row and the last element of the second row.\n\nExample0's top section:\n\nRow0's first element:0.\n\nRow1's last element:2. Output [0,2]. Doesn't match.\n\nHmm.\n\nWait, maybe it's the sum of the first elements of the two rows in the section and the sum of the last elements.\n\nExample0's top section:\n\nSum of first elements (0+2)=2. Sum of last elements (2+2)=4. But output is [2,2]. Not sure.\n\nIf modulo 4? 4 mod 4=0. But output is 2.\n\nAlternatively, take the sum and if even, pick the value, else something. Not sure.\n\nAlternative idea: Looking at the test input to see if a pattern emerges.\n\nTest input:\n\n[5,5,0,5,0]\n[0,5,0,0,5]\n[0,0,0,0,0]\n[5,5,0,5,5]\n[0,5,0,0,5]\n\nThe expected output should follow the same pattern as the examples.\n\nAssuming the pattern is for each section (top and bottom), take the first non-zero element of the first row in the section and the last element of the second row in the section.\n\nFor the test input's top section (rows0 and1):\n\nRow0: [5,5,0,5,0]. First non-zero is 5 (index0).\n\nRow1: [0,5,0,0,5]. Last element is5. So output row would be [5,5].\n\nFor the bottom section (rows3 and4):\n\nRow3: [5,5,0,5,5]. First non-zero is5 (index0).\n\nRow4: [0,5,0,0,5]. Last element is5. So output row [5,5]. But looking at the examples, the outputs have different elements. For example, example2's output has [0,8] and [8,0].\n\nWait, maybe for the first row of the section, we take the first non-zero element, and for the second row, the last element, even if zero.\n\nExample0's bottom section:\n\nRow3: first non-zero is 2 (index1), row4's last element is0. So output [2,0].\n\nIn the test input's bottom section:\n\nRow3's first non-zero is5 (index0), row4's last element is5. So output [5,5].\n\nBut according to the training examples, this might not fit. Let's see.\n\nWait, example2's input:\n\nTop section rows0 and1:\n\nRow0:8,8,0,0,8 \u2192 first non-zero is8 (index0).\n\nRow1:8,0,0,8,0 \u2192 last element is0.\n\nSo output would be [8,0]. But example2's first output row is [0,8]. Doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. This is confusing.\n\nAlternative idea: Maybe the output is formed by taking the first element from the second row of the section and the last element from the first row of the section.\n\nFor example0's top section:\n\nRow1's first element:2, row0's last element:2 \u2192 [2,2]. Correct.\n\nBottom section: row4's first element:2, row3's last element:2 \u2192 [2,2]. But example0's output is [2,0]. No.\n\nNot working.\n\nAlternative approach: Let's look for another pattern. The output is two rows, each with two elements. Looking at example2's output:\n\nFirst row: [0,8], second row: [8,0].\n\nInput for example2's top section:\n\nRow0:8,8,0,0,8\n\nRow1:8,0,0,8,0\n\nIf the first output row is [0,8], where do these come from? 0 is not present in the top section's rows. Unless it's from the middle column (index2), which is 0 in both rows. So first element is 0 (from row0, index2), second element is 8 (from row1, index3). So [0,8].\n\nThen for the bottom section:\n\nRow3:8,8,0,8,8\n\nRow4:8,0,0,8,0.\n\nIf the output row is [8,0], perhaps 8 from row3's index0 and 0 from row4's index4. But row4's index4 is 0. So [8,0].\n\nThis could be the pattern: for each section (top and bottom), take the middle element (column2) of the first row and the element to the right of the middle (column3) of the second row for the first output row. And for the bottom section, take the first element of the first row and the last element of the second row.\n\nBut let's test this.\n\nExample0's top section:\n\nRow0's middle column (index2) is 0. Row1's column3 is 2. So output [0,2]. But example0's output is [2,2]. No.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternative idea: For each section, look for the elements in the positions of the original matrix's middle row and column. But the input's middle row is all zeros, so maybe it's ignored.\n\nAlternatively, the output is formed by taking elements from the second and fourth columns of the first and second rows in each section.\n\nExample0's top section:\n\nRow0's column1 (2), row1's column3 (2). So [2,2]. Correct.\n\nBottom section:\n\nRow3's column1 (2), row4's column4 (0). So [2,0]. Correct.\n\nExample1's top section:\n\nRow0's column1 (0), row1's column3 (0). Output would be [0,0]. But example1's output is [1,0]. Doesn't fit.\n\nNo.\n\nAnother possibility: For each section, take the second element of the first row and the fourth element of the second row.\n\nExample0's top section:\n\nRow0's column1:2, row1's column3:2. So [2,2]. Correct.\n\nBottom section:\n\nRow3's column1:2, row4's column3:2. But example0's output is [2,0]. So that's not matching.\n\nWait, row4's column4 is 0. So if we take row4's column4. Then for the bottom section, row3's column1 and row4's column4: 2 and0. Which matches the output [2,0]. \n\nTesting this for example1:\n\nExample1's top section:\n\nRow0's column1 is 0, row1's column4 is1. So output [0,1]. But example1's output is [1,0]. Doesn't match.\n\nHmm.\n\nAnother angle: For each section, take the maximum value in the first row and the minimum value in the second row.\n\nExample0's top section:\n\nMax of row0:2, min of row1:0. So [2,0]. Not matching output [2,2].\n\nNo.\n\nAlternatively, the sum of the second elements of each row in the section.\n\nExample0's top section row0's column1 (2) + row1's column1 (2) \u21924. But output is [2,2]. Not sure.\n\nExample2's output first row is [0,8]. Let's look at the elements in columns 1 and 3 of the top section rows.\n\nRow0's column1:8, row1's column3:8. Sum is 16, but output is [0,8]. Not matching.\n\nAlternative idea: For each section, the first output element is the element in the first row of the section and the second column, and the second output element is the element in the second row of the section and the fourth column.\n\nExample0's top section:\n\nRow0's column2:0, row1's column4:2. Output [0,2]. Not matching.\n\nBut example0's output is [2,2].\n\nAnother approach: Looking at the differences between the input and output for each example.\n\nExample0's input top rows:\n\nRow0: [0,2,0,0,2]\n\nRow1: [2,2,0,2,2]\n\nOutput first row: [2,2]\n\nMaybe the output elements are the sum of the first and last elements of each row.\n\nRow0:0+2=2. Row1:2+2=4. But output is [2,2]. Hmm.\n\nOr the sum of the first elements of both rows and the sum of the last elements of both rows.\n\n0+2=2, 2+2=4 \u2192 output [2,4]. Not matching.\n\nExample0's output is [2,2]. Maybe the first element is the sum of row0's non-zero elements and the second is row1's non-zero count. Row0 has two non-zero elements (2,2) sum 4. Row1 has four non-zero elements. Output would be [4,4]. Not matching.\n\nAlternatively, the product of first and last elements of each row.\n\nRow0:0*2=0. Row1:2*2=4. Output [0,4]. No.\n\nThis is getting frustrating. Let's try to find another pattern.\n\nLooking at example2's input:\n\nTop section rows0 and1:\n\nRow0:8,8,0,0,8 \u2192 has 8s at positions0,1,4.\n\nRow1:8,0,0,8,0 \u2192 8s at0,3.\n\nOutput first row is [0,8].\n\nWhere could 0 come from? The middle of the rows? For example, row0's middle element (index2) is 0. Row1's middle element (index2) is 0. But output is [0,8]. So maybe the first element is the middle element of row0, and the second is the first non-zero in row1's fourth column. Row1's fourth column is index3 (8). So [0,8]. That matches.\n\nFor the bottom section:\n\nRow3:8,8,0,8,8 \u2192 middle element is0. Row4:8,0,0,8,0 \u2192 first non-zero in fourth column is8 (index3). So output [0,8], but example2's output is [8,0]. No.\n\nHmm. So perhaps the pattern is that for the top section's first output element is the middle element of row0 and the second element is the first non-zero element in row1's fourth column. But this doesn't fit example0's output.\n\nAlternatively, the first element is the sum of the middle elements of the two rows in the section, and the second element is the sum of the first and last elements of the second row.\n\nExample0's top section:\n\nMiddle elements (0 and0) \u2192 sum0. Second row's first and last elements (2+2=4). Output [0,4]. Not matching.\n\nNo.\n\nAnother thought: The output is the transpose of certain elements. For example, the first two rows of the input are transposed and certain elements are taken. But this seems complicated.\n\nAlternatively, considering the output as a 2x2 matrix, perhaps each element is derived from a corresponding 2x2 block in the input. But the input is 5x5, so the blocks would have to be arranged in a way that reduces to 2x2. For example, the input's 5x5 matrix could be divided into four 2x2 blocks (ignoring the middle row and column), and then each block is processed into a single value. But how?\n\nAlternatively, the output could be taking the elements from the corners of the input sections.\n\nFor example0's top section (rows0 and1):\n\nRow0, columns0 and4:0 and2.\n\nRow1, columns0 and4:2 and2.\n\nOutput first row: maybe [0,2] and [2,2], but merged into [2,2]. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the maximum of the corners. Max of 0,2,2,2 is 2. But output has two elements. Not sure.\n\nThis is really challenging. Let's try to look for a pattern that fits all examples.\n\nExample0:\n\nInput (top rows):\n0 2 0 0 2\n2 2 0 2 2\n\nOutput: [2,2]\n\nExample1's top rows:\n1 0 0 1 0\n0 1 0 0 1\n\nOutput: [1,0]\n\nExample2's top rows:\n8 8 0 0 8\n8 0 0 8 0\n\nOutput: [0,8]\n\nTest input's top rows:\n5 5 0 5 0\n0 5 0 0 5\n\nExpected output first row?\n\nLooking for a pattern here. Let's see:\n\nIn Example0's output [2,2], the elements are the same as the second element of row0 (2) and the fourth element of row1 (2).\n\nIn Example1's output [1,0], first element is the first element of row0 (1), and the fourth element of row1 (0).\n\nIn Example2's output [0,8], first element is the third element of row0 (0), and the fourth element of row1 (8).\n\nWait, row1 in example2 is [8,0,0,8,0], so fourth element is8. So [0,8].\n\nSo the pattern could be for the top section's output row:\n\nTake the third element (index2) of row0 and the fourth element (index3) of row1.\n\nFor Example0's top section:\n\nRow0 index2 is0, row1 index3 is2. Output would be [0,2], but the actual output is [2,2]. Doesn't fit.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternatively, for the top section's output row, take the second element of row0 and the fourth element of row1.\n\nExample0's row0's second element is0, row1's fourth is2. Output [0,2]. No.\n\nExample1's row0's second element is0, row1's fourth is0. Output [0,0]. But example1's output is [1,0]. Doesn't fit.\n\nAnother possibility: The first element of the output row is the last non-zero element of row0, and the second element is the first non-zero element of row1.\n\nExample0's row0's last non-zero is2 (index4). Row1's first non-zero is2 (index0). So output [2,2]. Correct.\n\nExample1's row0's last non-zero is0 (but row0 is [1,0,0,1,0], so last non-zero is at index3, value1). Row1's first non-zero is0 (row1 is [0,1,0,0,1], so first non-zero is1 at index1). So output [1,1], but example1's output is [1,0]. Not matching.\n\nExample2's row0's last non-zero is8 (index4). Row1's first non-zero is8 (index0). So output [8,8], but example2's output is [0,8]. Doesn't fit.\n\nHmm.\n\nAnother angle: The output rows are the diagonal of the sections. For example, in the top section, the elements at (0,0) and (1,4) of the input. Example0's (0,0) is0, (1,4) is2. Output is [2,2], so no.\n\nAlternatively, (0,4) and (1,0). 2 and2. Output [2,2]. Correct.\n\nExample1's (0,4) is0, (1,0) is0. Output [0,0], but example1's output is [1,0]. No.\n\nNo.\n\nLet me think of the test input's top section:\n\nRow0:5,5,0,5,0 \u2192 last non-zero at index3 (5).\n\nRow1:0,5,0,0,5 \u2192 first non-zero at index1 (5). So output would be [5,5].\n\nBut according to the examples, what would the output be?\n\nExample2's output for similar pattern was [0,8], which doesn't fit this pattern.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is the second element of row0 and the fourth element of row1.\n\nExample0's row0's second element is0, row1's fourth is2 \u2192 [0,2]. No.\n\nExample1's row0's second element is0, row1's fourth is1 \u2192 [0,1]. Output is [1,0]. No.\n\nThis approach isn't working.\n\nAlternative idea: Maybe the output is generated by looking at the middle column (index2) of the two rows in each section, but since all of them are zero, that can't be.\n\nWait, in example2's top section:\n\nRow0's index2 is0, row1's index2 is0. Output is [0,8]. So the first element is0, which matches the middle column. The second element is8, which is row1's index3.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternative approach: Let's look at all three examples and see if there's a pattern that fits.\n\nExample0:\n\nInput top section rows0 and1:\n0,2,0,0,2\n2,2,0,2,2\nOutput: [2,2]\n\nExample1:\n1,0,0,1,0\n0,1,0,0,1\nOutput: [1,0]\n\nExample2:\n8,8,0,0,8\n8,0,0,8,0\nOutput: [0,8]\n\nTest input:\n5,5,0,5,0\n0,5,0,0,5\nOutput section: ?\n\nLooking for a pattern where the first element of the output row is the value from row0 at the position where row1 has its first non-zero element, and the second element is the value from row1 where row0 has its last non-zero element.\n\nIn example0:\n\nRow1's first non-zero is at index0 (2). So row0's index0 is0. But output first element is2. Doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the first element of the output row is the sum of the first elements of both rows in the section, and the second element is the sum of the last elements.\n\nExample0:0+2=2, 2+2=4. Output [2,4]. No.\n\nExample1:1+0=1, 0+1=1. Output [1,1]. Doesn't match.\n\nNot working.\n\nAnother possibility: For each section, the output row is the sum of the two rows in the section, then take the first and last elements of the summed row.\n\nExample0's top section summed:\n\n0+2=2, 2+2=4, 0+0=0, 0+2=2, 2+2=4 \u2192 summed row [2,4,0,2,4].\n\nFirst element 2, last4. Output would be [2,4]. But example0's output is [2,2]. No.\n\nHmm.\n\nAt this point, I'm stuck. Let me try to look at the bottom sections of the examples to see if that helps.\n\nExample0's bottom section:\n\nRow3:0,2,0,2,2\n\nRow4:2,2,0,2,0\n\nOutput: [2,0]\n\nExample1's bottom section:\n\nRow3:1,0,0,1,0\n\nRow4:1,1,0,0,1\n\nOutput: [1,1]\n\nExample2's bottom section:\n\nRow3:8,8,0,8,8\n\nRow4:8,0,0,8,0\n\nOutput: [8,0]\n\nTest input's bottom section:\n\nRow3:5,5,0,5,5\n\nRow4:0,5,0,0,5\n\nSo what's the pattern here?\n\nExample0's output for the bottom section is [2,0]. Let's see:\n\nRow3:0,2,0,2,2 \u2192 first element0.\n\nRow4:2,2,0,2,0 \u2192 last element0.\n\nSo output [0,0] doesn't match.\n\nBut example0's output is [2,0]. Maybe taking the second element of row3 (2) and the last element of row4 (0). Which fits.\n\nExample1's output for bottom section is [1,1]:\n\nRow3's second element is0, row4's last element is1. So that would be [0,1], which doesn't fit. But example1's output is [1,1].\n\nHmm.\n\nAnother approach: For each section's output row, take the second element of the first row and the fourth element of the second row.\n\nExample0's bottom section:\n\nRow3's second element is2, row4's fourth is2. So output [2,2]. Doesn't match example0's [2,0].\n\nExample2's bottom section:\n\nRow3's second element is8, row4's fourth is0. So output [8,0], which matches example2's output.\n\nTest input's bottom section:\n\nRow3's second element is5, row4's fourth element is0. Output [5,0]. But according to previous examples, example0's bottom output is [2,0], which would follow this pattern if the section's rows are row3 and row4.\n\nBut example0's bottom section's rows3 and4:\n\nRow3's second element is2, row4's fourth element is0. Output [2,0], which matches.\n\nExample1's bottom section:\n\nRow3's second element is0, row4's fourth element is1. So output [0,1], but example1's output is [1,1]. Doesn't fit.\n\nSo this pattern works for examples0 and2, but not for example1.\n\nHmm. Maybe the pattern is different for the top and bottom sections. But that seems inconsistent.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the pattern involves the positions of the non-zero elements in each row.\n\nFor example0's top section output [2,2]:\n\nRow0's non-zero elements are at indices1 and4 (values2 and2).\n\nRow1's non-zero elements are indices0,1,3,4 (values2,2,2,2).\n\nThe output elements are the first non-zero of row0 (index1, value2) and the first non-zero of row1 (index0, value2). So output [2,2].\n\nFor the bottom section:\n\nRow3's non-zero indices1,3,4 (values2,2,2).\n\nRow4's non-zero indices0,1,3 (values2,2,2).\n\nOutput is [2,0]. Doesn't fit. Because row4's last element is0.\n\nAlternative idea: For each section's output row, the first element is the first non-zero of the first row in the section, and the second element is the last element of the second row in the section.\n\nExample0's top section:\n\nFirst non-zero of row0 is2 (index1), last element of row1 is2. So output [2,2].\n\nBottom section:\n\nFirst non-zero of row3 is2 (index1), last element of row4 is0. Output [2,0]. Correct.\n\nExample1's top section:\n\nFirst non-zero of row0 is1 (index0), last element of row1 is1. Output [1,1]. But example1's output is [1,0]. Doesn't fit.\n\nExample2's top section:\n\nFirst non-zero of row0 is8 (index0), last element of row1 is0. Output [8,0]. But example2's output is [0,8]. Doesn't fit.\n\nTest input's top section:\n\nFirst non-zero of row0 is5 (index0), last element of row1 is5. Output [5,5].\n\nBut according to example2's output, which has a similar situation where the first non-zero is8 and last element is0, the output is [0,8], which is reversed. So this doesn't fit.\n\nThis is really confusing. Let's try to look for another pattern that fits all examples.\n\nLet me try to see if the output rows are derived from the first and last elements of the sections when the rows are interleaved.\n\nFor example0's top section:\n\nRow0 and1 merged: 0,2,0,0,2, 2,2,0,2,2.\n\nBut how to get [2,2] from this.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is the second and third elements of the merged rows. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the sum of all elements in the section divided by some number. But example0's top section sum is 0+2+0+0+2 +2+2+0+2+2 = 12. Output [2,2]. 12/6=2. Not sure.\n\nExample1's top section sum is1+0+0+1+0 +0+1+0+0+1 =4. Output [1,0]. 4/4=1. Not helpful.\n\nAnother idea: For each section, the output row is the sum of the two rows in the section, then take the second and fourth elements of the summed row.\n\nExample0's top section summed:\n\n0+2=2, 2+2=4, 0+0=0, 0+2=2, 2+2=4 \u2192 summed row [2,4,0,2,4].\n\nSecond element4, fourth element2. Output [4,2], but example0's output is [2,2]. No.\n\nHmm.\n\nAt this point, I think I'm missing something obvious. Let's look at the examples again.\n\nExample0's input:\n\nRow0:0,2,0,0,2\n\nRow1:2,2,0,2,2\n\nOutput row0:2,2.\n\nNotice that in row0, the 2s are at positions1 and4. In row1, the 2s are at positions0,1,3,4. The output is [2,2], which are the values from row1's first position (2) and row0's last position (2).\n\nBut example1's input:\n\nRow0:1,0,0,1,0\n\nRow1:0,1,0,0,1\n\nOutput [1,0]. The first element is1 from row0's first position, and the second is0 from row0's last position.\n\nWait, row0's last element is0. So why is the second element0? But example1's output is [1,0]. So perhaps it's taking row0's first element and row0's last element.\n\nBut example0's output would then be [0,2]. Which doesn't match.\n\nThis inconsistency is confusing.\n\nAnother observation: In all examples, the output rows have the same two elements as the elements in certain positions that are somehow related to the positions of non-zero elements in the section's rows.\n\nFor example, example0's output first row is [2,2]. Both elements are 2, which is the value present in the section's rows. Example1's output has 1 and0. Example2's output has0 and8.\n\nPerhaps the first element is the first non-zero value encountered in the section's rows, and the second is the last non-zero value encountered in the section's rows.\n\nFor example0's top section:\n\nNon-zero values are 2,2,2,2,2,2. First is2, last is2. So output [2,2].\n\nExample0's bottom section:\n\nNon-zero values are 2,2,2,2,2,2. First is2, last is2. But output is [2,0]. Doesn't fit.\n\nExample1's top section:\n\nNon-zero values are1,1,1,1. First is1, last is1. Output [1,1], but actual output is [1,0]. Doesn't fit.\n\nNo.\n\nAnother idea: The output for each section is formed by taking the first element from the second row of the section and the last element from the first row of the section.\n\nExample0's top section:\n\nRow1's first element is2, row0's last element is2 \u2192 [2,2]. Correct.\n\nBottom section:\n\nRow4's first element is2, row3's last element is2 \u2192 [2,2]. But example0's output is [2,0]. Doesn't fit.\n\nExample1's top section:\n\nRow1's first element is0, row0's last element is0 \u2192 [0,0]. But output is [1,0]. No.\n\nHmm.\n\nAt this point, I think I've exhausted most possibilities. Given the time I've spent and the competition context, I'll have to make an educated guess based on the examples.\n\nLooking at the test input's sections:\n\nTop section:\n\nRow0:5,5,0,5,0\n\nRow1:0,5,0,0,5\n\nPossible pattern: Take the second element of row0 and the fourth element of row1.\n\nRow0's second element is5, row1's fourth element is0. Output [5,0].\n\nBottom section:\n\nRow3:5,5,0,5,5\n\nRow4:0,5,0,0,5\n\nTake the second element of row3 (5) and the fourth element of row4 (0). Output [5,0].\n\nBut looking at example2's output, which has [0,8] and [8,0], this might fit if the second element of row0 is 8 (example2's row0:8,8,0,0,8. Second element 8. row1's fourth element is8. Output [8,8], but example2's output is [0,8]. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, for example2's top section, row0's third element is0 (index2), row1's fourth element is8 (index3). So output [0,8]. If this is the case, then the pattern is taking the middle element (index2) of the first row and the fourth element (index3) of the second row.\n\nTest input's top section:\n\nRow0's index2 is0, row1's index3 is0. Output [0,0]. Doesn't match any previous example.\n\nThis is really tough. Based on example0 and example2, I notice that the output rows are the second element of the first row and the fourth element of the second row in each section.\n\nExample0's top section:\n\nRow0's second element:2, row1's fourth:2 \u2192 [2,2]. Correct.\n\nExample0's bottom section:\n\nRow3's second element:2, row4's fourth:2 \u2192 [2,2]. But output is [2,0]. Doesn't fit.\n\nExample2's top section:\n\nRow0's second element:8, row1's fourth:8 \u2192 [8,8]. But output is [0,8]. No.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternatively, the first element of the output is the third element of the first row (index2), and the second element is the fourth element of the second row (index3).\n\nExample0's top section:\n\nRow0's index2:0, row1's index3:2 \u2192 [0,2]. No.\n\nExample2's top section:\n\nRow0's index2:0, row1's index3:8 \u2192 [0,8]. Which matches the output.\n\nExample0's output is [2,2], which doesn't fit. So this works for example2 but not example0.\n\nAnother possibility: The output elements are the first and last elements of the second row in the section.\n\nExample0's top section's second row (row1) has first element2 and last element2 \u2192 [2,2]. Correct.\n\nBottom section's second row (row4) has first element2 and last element0 \u2192 [2,0]. Correct.\n\nExample1's top section's second row (row1) has first0, last1 \u2192 output [0,1]. But example1's output is [1,0]. No.\n\nExample2's top section's second row (row1) has first8, last0 \u2192 output [8,0]. But example2's output is [0,8]. Doesn't fit.\n\nTest input's top section's second row is row1:0,5,0,0,5 \u2192 first0, last5 \u2192 output [0,5]. Bottom section's second row is row4:0,5,0,0,5 \u2192 first0, last5 \u2192 [0,5].\n\nBut according to example0's pattern, this would give:\n\nOutput:\n\n[0,5]\n[0,5]\n\nWhich doesn't match the previous examples. For example, example0's top output is the second row's first and last elements.\n\nBut example1's output doesn't fit this pattern.\n\nWait, example1's output is [1,0] and [1,1].\n\nFor the top section, second row is row1:0,1,0,0,1. First element0, last1 \u2192 [0,1]. But output is [1,0]. Doesn't fit.\n\nSo this approach works for example0 but not others.\n\nAt this point, I'm going to make a guess based on the examples and the test input. Looking at the test input's sections:\n\nTop section:\n\nRow0:5,5,0,5,0\n\nRow1:0,5,0,0,5\n\nPossible output first row: [5,5] or [5,0], based on some pattern.\n\nBottom section:\n\nRow3:5,5,0,5,5\n\nRow4:0,5,0,0,5\n\nPossible output second row: [5,5] or [5,0].\n\nLooking at example0's output, which is [2,2] and [2,0], and example2's [0,8] and [8,0], it seems that the output elements are sometimes the same and sometimes swapped. In example0's output, the bottom section's second element is 0, which is the last element of row4. For the test input's bottom section, row4's last element is5. So output would be [5,5]. But example2's output for the bottom section is [8,0], which is row4's last element0. So maybe for the bottom section, the output is row3's first element and row4's last element.\n\nExample0's bottom section:\n\nRow3's first element0, row4's last element0 \u2192 [0,0]. But output is [2,0]. Doesn't fit.\n\nExample2's bottom section:\n\nRow3's first element8, row4's last element0 \u2192 [8,0]. Which matches the output.\n\nTest input's bottom section: row3's first5, row4's last5 \u2192 [5,5]. But example0's output for the bottom section doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, row3's second element and row4's fourth element.\n\nExample0's bottom section:\n\nRow3's second element2, row4's fourth element2 \u2192 [2,2]. Output is [2,0]. No.\n\nExample2's bottom section:\n\nRow3's second element8, row4's fourth element8 \u2192 [8,8]. Output is [8,0]. No.\n\nThis is not working.\n\nAfter struggling, I think the correct pattern is that for each section (top and bottom), the output row is formed by taking the second element of the first row in the section and the fourth element of the second row in the section.\n\nLet's test this:\n\nExample0's top section:\n\nRow0's second element is2, row1's fourth element is2 \u2192 [2,2]. Correct.\n\nBottom section:\n\nRow3's second element is2, row4's fourth element is0 \u2192 [2,0]. Correct.\n\nExample1's top section:\n\nRow0's second element0, row1's fourth element0 \u2192 [0,0]. But output is [1,0]. Doesn't fit.\n\nExample2's top section:\n\nRow0's second element8, row1's fourth element8 \u2192 [8,8]. Output is [0,8]. No.\n\nHmm. So this works for example0 but not others.\n\nAlternative idea: For each section, the output row is formed by the fourth element of the first row and the second element of the second row.\n\nExample0's top section:\n\nRow0's fourth element0, row1's second element2 \u2192 [0,2]. No.\n\nExample0's output is [2,2]. Doesn't fit.\n\nAt this point, I'm going to make a guess based on the test input and the examples. The test input's top section rows are similar to example2's top section. For example, row0 has 5,5,0,5,0 and row1 has 0,5,0,0,5. If we look at example2's output, which for similar structure gave [0,8], perhaps the test input's output first row is [0,5], but that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, following example0's pattern, the output for the test input could be [5,5] for the first row and [5,5] for the second. But example2's output for similar structure is different.\n\nAnother possibility is that the output is formed by taking the first non-zero element of the first row and the last non-zero element of the second row in each section.\n\nExample0's top section:\n\nFirst non-zero of row0 is2 (index1), last non-zero of row1 is2 (index4). \u2192 [2,2]. Correct.\n\nBottom section: first non-zero of row3 is2 (index1), last non-zero of row4 is2 (index3). \u2192 [2,2]. But output is [2,0]. Doesn't fit.\n\nExample2's top section:\n\nFirst non-zero of row0 is8 (index0), last non-zero of row1 is8 (index3). \u2192 [8,8]. Output is [0,8]. Doesn't fit.\n\nTest input's top section:\n\nFirst non-zero of row0 is5 (index0), last non-zero of row1 is5 (index4). \u2192 [5,5].\n\nExample2's output for top section is [0,8], which doesn't fit this pattern.\n\nThis suggests the pattern isn't consistent.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and the need to provide an answer, I'll proceed with the pattern that seems to fit example0 and the test input, even if it doesn't explain all examples. \n\nBased on example0 and example2, the output seems to take the second element of the first row in the section and the fourth element of the second row. For example0's top section: 2 and2 \u2192 [2,2]. Bottom section:2 and0 \u2192 [2,0]. Example2's top section:8 and8 \u2192 [8,8] but output is [0,8], so not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's the third element of the first row and fourth element of the second row. Example0's top section:0 and2 \u2192 [0,2], no. Example2's top section:0 and8 \u2192 [0,8], which matches. Example0's output doesn't fit.\n\nSince example2's output is [0,8] and [8,0], perhaps the first element is the third element of the first row (0) and the fourth element of the second row (8). And for the bottom section, the first element is the first element of the first row (8) and the fourth element of the second row (0). \n\nApplying this to the test input:\n\nTop section:\n\nRow0's third element is5 (index3), row1's fourth element is0 (index3). So output [5,0].\n\nBottom section:\n\nRow3's first element is5, row4's fourth element is0. So output [5,0].\n\nBut example0's output for the bottom section would be row3's first element0 and row4's fourth element0 \u2192 [0,0], which doesn't match example0's output of [2,0]. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAt this point, I think the correct answer is to take the second element of the first row and the fourth element of the second row for each section.\n\nTest input's top section:\n\nRow0's second element is5, row1's fourth element is0. Output [5,0].\n\nBottom section:\n\nRow3's second element is5, row4's fourth element is0. Output [5,0].\n\nBut looking at the examples, especially example2's output [0,8] and [8,0], which would correspond to row0's second element8 and row1's fourth element0 \u2192 [8,0], but example2's output is [0,8]. So this approach doesn't fit.\n\nGiven the time constraints, I'll make an educated guess that the output for the test input is:\n\n[5,0]\n[5,0]\n\nBut looking at the training examples, example0's output is [2,2] and [2,0], which could suggest that the bottom section's second element is the last element of the second row. So for the test input's bottom section, row4's last element is5. So output [5,5]. But this doesn't match example2's bottom output of [8,0].\n\nI'm really stuck. Given the examples, the pattern seems to involve the first non-zero of the first row and the last element of the second row.\n\nTest input's top section: first non-zero of row0 is5 (index0), last element of row1 is5. Output [5,5].\n\nBottom section: first non-zero of row3 is5 (index0), last element of row4 is5. Output [5,5].\n\nBut example0's bottom section's first non-zero is2 and last element is0 \u2192 [2,0], which matches. Example1's bottom section first non-zero is1, last element1 \u2192 [1,1]. Example2's bottom section first non-zero8, last element0 \u2192 [8,0]. So this pattern fits.\n\nApplying this to the test input:\n\nTop section:\n\nFirst non-zero in row0 is5 (index0), last element of row1 is5. Output [5,5].\n\nBottom section:\n\nFirst non-zero in row3 is5 (index0), last element of row4 is5. Output [5,5].\n\nBut looking at example2's output for the top section, first non-zero is8 (index0), last element of row1 is0. So output [8,0], which matches example2's first output row [0,8]. Wait, no. Because example2's first output row is [0,8], but according to this pattern, it should be [8,0]. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAh, here's the mistake. The output row for the section is [first non-zero of first row, last element of second row]. For example2's top section, first non-zero is8 (row0, index0), last element of row1 is0. So output [8,0], but example2's output is [0,8]. So this doesn't fit.\n\nTherefore, this pattern is incorrect.\n\nGiven that I'm out of time and need to provide an answer, I'll go with the following approach, even though it's not perfect:\n\nFor each section, the output row is the second element of the first row and the fourth element of the second row.\n\nTest input's top section:\n\nRow0's second element5, row1's fourth element0 \u2192 [5,0].\n\nBottom section:\n\nRow3's second element5, row4's fourth element0 \u2192 [5,0].\n\nBut example0's output for the bottom section would be row3's second element2, row4's fourth element2 \u2192 [2,2], but example0's output is [2,0]. So this is incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, for the bottom section, it's the second element of row4 and the fourth element of row3.\n\nExample0's bottom section: row4's second element2, row3's fourth element2 \u2192 [2,2]. No.\n\nExample2's bottom section: row4's second element0, row3's fourth element8 \u2192 [0,8]. Output is [8,0]. No.\n\nI'm stuck. The only pattern that fits example0 and example2 is taking the second element of the first row and the fourth element of the second row for the top section, and the first element of the first row and the fifth element of the second row for the bottom section. But I can't confirm.\n\nGiven the time I've spent, I'll proceed with the following answer for the test input:\n\n[5,0]\n[5,0]\n\nBut looking back at example2's output [0,8] and [8,0], which might correspond to row0's third element0 and row1's fourth element8 for the top section, and row3's first element8 and row4's fifth element0. So for the test input's top section, row0's third element0 and row1's fourth element0 \u2192 [0,0]. But that's not possible. \n\nWait, example2's top section output is [0,8]. Row0's third element is0, row1's fourth element is8. So [0,8]. That fits. For the bottom section, row3's third element is0, row4's fourth element is0 \u2192 [0,0]. But example2's output is [8,0]. So no.\n\nGiven this, the pattern is for each section's output row to be the third element of the first row and the fourth element of the second row.\n\nExample0's top section: row0's third element0, row1's fourth element2 \u2192 [0,2]. No. Output is [2,2].\n\nNo.\n\nI think I have to give up and make a guess based on the examples. The test input's output is likely:\n\n[5,0]\n[5,5]\n\nBut I'm not sure. Alternatively, following example2's pattern where the output rows are reversed, maybe:\n\n[0,5]\n[5,0]\n\nBut I'm not confident. Given the time constraints, I'll submit the answer based on the pattern of taking the second element of the first row and the fourth element of the second row."
