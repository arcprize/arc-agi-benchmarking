        "cot_1": "Okay, let's tackle this puzzle. So, the task is to figure out the pattern that transforms the given input matrices into the output matrices. Let's look at the training examples one by one to see if I can spot a pattern.\n\nStarting with Example 0:\n\nInput:\n[0, 4, 0, 9]\n[0, 0, 0, 0]\n[0, 4, 6, 0]\n[1, 0, 0, 0]\n\nOutput:\n[0, 0, 0, 0]\n[0, 0, 0, 0]\n[0, 4, 0, 0]\n[1, 4, 6, 9]\n\nHmm. Let's compare each row. The output seems to have the non-zero elements from the input shifted downward in some way. For instance, the first row of the input has 4 and 9, but in the output, those numbers appear in the last row. The third row of the input has 4 and 6, which in the output are in the third and fourth rows. Wait, maybe each column is being processed individually. Let me check the columns.\n\nLooking at each column:\n\nFirst column input: [0, 0, 0, 1] \u2192 Output: [0, 0, 0, 1]. So the 1 stays at the bottom. Second column input: [4,0,4,0] \u2192 Output: [0,0,4,4]. So the 4s are moved to the bottom, but in the same column. Third column input: [0,0,6,0] \u2192 Output: [0,0,0,6]. Fourth column: [9,0,0,0] \u2192 Output: [0,0,0,9]. So it looks like for each column, the non-zero numbers are shifted down to the bottom, stacking them in the same order but pushing zeros to the top. Wait, but in the second column of Example 0's input, there are two 4s. In the output, they are at positions 2 and 3 (third and fourth rows). Wait, the output for the second column is [0,0,4,4]. Oh, right. So maybe the non-zero elements in each column are moved to the bottom of their respective columns, maintaining their order but shifting them down as much as possible. So zeros are pushed to the top. Let me check another example to confirm.\n\nExample 1:\n\nInput (columns might be a bit longer, but let's take first column for example):\n\nFirst column of input:\n[0,0,0,4,4,4] \u2192 Output first column: [0,0,0,4,4,4]. So all the 4s are at the bottom, which matches the idea. Let's check another column. Let's take the third column in input:\n\nThird column in input for Example1:\n[0,0,0,0,7,7] \u2192 Output third column: [0,0,0,0,7,7]. So same as input? Wait, no. The output's third column is [0,0,0,0,7,7], which is same as input. Wait, but in the input, the third column is [0,0,0,0,7,7], right? So maybe if they're already at the bottom, they stay. Let's look at another column. Let's take column 4 in Example1 input: [9,0,0,0,0,0]. Output column 4: [0,0,0,0,0,9]. So the 9 moves to the bottom. But in the output's last row, the 9 is in the sixth column. Wait, in Example1's input, the fourth column (assuming columns are 0-based or 1-based? Let me recheck. The input rows are:\n\nRow0: [0,0,0,0,0,9]\nRow1: [0,0,0,8,0,0]\nRow2: [0,0,0,0,0,0]\nRow3: [4,0,0,0,0,0]\nRow4: [4,0,7,8,0,0]\nRow5: [4,0,7,0,0,0]\n\nSo the fourth column (index 3 if 0-based) would be [0,8,0,0,8,0]. The output for this column would be [0,0,0,0,8,8]. Wait, looking at the output's rows:\n\nOutput:\n\n[0,0,0,0,0,0]\n[0,0,0,0,0,0]\n[0,0,0,0,0,0]\n[4,0,0,0,0,0]\n[4,0,7,8,0,0]\n[4,0,7,8,0,9]\n\nSo the fourth column (index 3) in the output is [0,0,0,0,8,8]. Wait, the input's column 3 (fourth) had entries 0,8,0,0,8,0. So in the output, the 8s are moved to the bottom of their column. So the two 8s are now in rows 4 and 5. So the process is: for each column, take all the non-zero numbers, preserve their order, and push them to the bottom of the column. The zeros are left at the top. So that's the pattern. Let me confirm with another example.\n\nExample2:\n\nInput:\n\n[0, 0, 0, 1, 0]\n[0, 3, 0, 0, 0]\n[0, 3, 0, 1, 2]\n[6, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[0, 3, 0, 0, 0]\n\nOutput:\n\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[0, 3, 0, 0, 0]\n[0, 3, 0, 1, 0]\n[6, 3, 0, 1, 2]\n\nLooking at column 1 (second column if 0-based). Input column 1 entries: [0,3,3,0,3]. So the non-zero entries are 3,3,3. In the output, this column becomes [0,0,3,3,3]. So the 3s are moved to the bottom of the column. Yes, that fits. Another column: column 0. Input entries: [0,0,0,6,0]. Output column 0 is [0,0,0,0,6]. So the 6 is moved to the bottom. Column 3 (fourth) in input: [1,0,1,0,0]. Output column 3: [0,0,0,1,1]. So the two 1s are moved to the bottom. That checks out.\n\nSo the pattern is: For each column in the input matrix, take all non-zero elements, keep their relative order, and move them to the bottom of the column. The zeros are filled above them. So the transformation is to \"gravity\" the non-zero elements down in each column, keeping their order, and zeros fill the top.\n\nNow, applying this to the test input:\n\nTest Input:\n\nRow0: [0, 2, 0, 4, 3]\nRow1: [5, 0, 0, 0, 0]\nRow2: [0, 0, 6, 0, 0]\nRow3: [5, 2, 0, 4, 0]\nRow4: [5, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nSo the columns are (assuming each column is 0 to 4, rows 0 to 4):\n\nColumn 0: [0,5,0,5,5]\nNon-zero: 5,5,5. So in the output column, they should be at the bottom. So the output column 0 would be [0,0,0,5,5,5] but wait, the matrix is 5 rows. Let's see:\n\nOriginal columns have 5 elements (since there are 5 rows). For each column:\n\nLet's process each column one by one.\n\nColumn 0:\nInput elements: [0,5,0,5,5]\nNon-zero: 5,5,5. So output column is [0,0,0,5,5,5] \u2192 but wait, the matrix is 5 rows. So wait, the test input has 5 rows. Let me check again. The test input is:\n\n[0, 2, 0, 4, 3]\n[5, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[0, 0, 6, 0, 0]\n[5, 2, 0, 4, 0]\n[5, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nSo each column has 5 elements. Let's process each column:\n\nColumn 0:\nElements: row0:0, row1:5, row2:0, row3:5, row4:5 \u2192 non-zero are 5,5,5. So the output column is [0,0,0,5,5,5], but since there are 5 rows, it's [0,0,0,5,5]. Wait, wait. Wait, the test input has 5 rows. So each column has 5 elements. So for column 0: the non-zeros are 5 (row1), 5 (row3), 5 (row4). So in the output column, they should be moved to the bottom. So the output column would have three 5s at the bottom, and the first two entries are 0. So:\n\nOutput column 0: [0, 0, 5,5,5] ?\n\nWait, but in the input, the order is 5 (row1), then 5 (row3), then 5 (row4). So the non-zero elements are in positions 1,3,4. So their order is 5,5,5. When moving to the bottom, they should be placed starting from the bottom. So in the output column, the non-zeros are placed in the last three positions. So the output column 0 would be [0,0,5,5,5]. But let's confirm with previous examples. For example, in Example0, the first column input was [0,0,0,1], which became [0,0,0,1]. So the 1 stays at the bottom. So in the test input column0, the three 5s are moved to the bottom three rows, and the top two are zeros. So column0 becomes [0,0,5,5,5] ?\n\nWait, but wait. Let's check Example1. In Example1's first column input was [0,0,0,4,4,4], and output was [0,0,0,4,4,4]. So when the non-zeros are already at the bottom, they stay. So the process is to collect the non-zeros in their original order, then place them starting from the bottom, but perhaps the way is to push them down as if gravity pulls them. So the non-zeros fall down until they hit another non-zero or the bottom.\n\nWait, maybe another way: For each column, the non-zero elements are stacked in their original order starting from the bottom. So for example, in column0 of test input, the non-zero elements are 5 (row1),5 (row3),5 (row4). So the order is 5,5,5. So stacking them from the bottom, the last entry is 5 (row4), then row3, then row1. Wait, but that's the same as the original order, but in column processing, perhaps the order is preserved but they are moved down.\n\nWait, in Example0's column2: input was [0,0,6,0], output [0,0,0,6]. So the 6 is moved to the bottom. So the non-zero elements are taken in their original order, then placed at the bottom of the column, with zeros above. So regardless of their original positions, the non-zeros are collected in order and placed at the bottom. So for a column like [5,0,0,5,5], the non-zeros are 5,5,5. So output is [0,0,5,5,5]. So in the test column0, the non-zeros are 5 (row1), 5 (row3),5 (row4) \u2192 so when collected in order, they are 5,5,5. So the output column is [0,0,5,5,5].\n\nLet's process each column of the test input:\n\nColumn 0: [0,5,0,5,5] \u2192 non-zeros [5,5,5] \u2192 output [0,0,5,5,5]\n\nColumn 1: [2,0,0,2,0] \u2192 non-zeros [2,2] \u2192 output [0,0,0,2,2]\n\nColumn 2: [0,0,6,0,0] \u2192 non-zero [6] \u2192 output [0,0,0,0,6]\n\nColumn3: [4,0,0,4,0] \u2192 non-zeros [4,4] \u2192 output [0,0,0,4,4]\n\nColumn4: [3,0,0,0,0] \u2192 non-zero [3] \u2192 output [0,0,0,0,3]\n\nSo the transformed matrix would be:\n\nRow0: 0,0,0,0,0\n\nRow1:0,0,0,0,0\n\nRow2:5,0,0,4,0 \u2192 Wait, no. Wait each row is built by the columns. Let's reconstruct the matrix by columns:\n\nAfter processing each column:\n\nColumn0 becomes [0,0,5,5,5]\n\nColumn1 becomes [0,0,0,2,2]\n\nColumn2 becomes [0,0,0,0,6]\n\nColumn3 becomes [0,0,0,4,4]\n\nColumn4 becomes [0,0,0,0,3]\n\nSo the rows would be:\n\nRow0: first elements of each column: 0,0,0,0,0 \u2192 [0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow1: second elements:0,0,0,0,0 \u2192 [0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow2: third elements:5,0,0,0,0 \u2192 [5,0,0,0,0]\n\nWait, wait no. Let's see:\n\nEach column's processed result is:\n\nColumn0: [0,0,5,5,5]\n\nSo row0 is column0's first element (0), row1 is second (0), row2 third (5), row3 fourth (5), row4 fifth (5).\n\nSimilarly for other columns.\n\nSo the rows would be constructed as follows:\n\nRow0: [0 (from col0), 0 (col1), 0 (col2), 0 (col3), 0 (col4)] \u2192 [0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow1: [0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow2: [5 (third element of col0), 0 (third of col1), 0 (third of col2), 0 (third of col3), 0 (third of col4)] \u2192 [5,0,0,0,0]\n\nWait, but col3's third element is 0, since col3's output is [0,0,0,4,4]. The third element is the third position (index 2 if 0-based?), which is 0. Wait, col3's processed output is [0,0,0,4,4]. So for row0, the first element is 0 (col3's first), row1: 0 (second), row2:0 (third), row3:4 (fourth), row4:4 (fifth). So the third element is 0. So row2's third element (col3) is 0.\n\nSo row2 would be [5 (from col0),0 (col1),0 (col2),0 (col3),0 (col4)] \u2192 [5,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow3: fourth elements of each column:\n\ncol0:5, col1:2 (fourth element of col1's processed output is 2?), wait:\n\ncol1's processed output is [0,0,0,2,2]. So elements are index 0:0, 1:0, 2:0, 3:2, 4:2. So row3 (index3) would take the fourth elements (index3):\n\ncol0:5 (fourth element is index3:5), col1:2 (index3:2), col2:0 (since col2's output is [0,0,0,0,6], index3 is 0), col3:4 (index3 of col3's output is 4), col4:3 (col4's output is [0,0,0,0,3], index3 is 0). Wait, no. Let's recheck:\n\ncol4's output is [0,0,0,0,3]. So the elements are row0:0, row1:0, row2:0, row3:0, row4:3. So for row3 (index3), it's 0.\n\nSo row3 would be [5 (col0 index3), 2 (col1 index3), 0 (col2 index3),4 (col3 index3), 0 (col4 index3)] \u2192 [5,2,0,4,0]\n\nRow4: fifth elements (index4):\n\ncol0:5, col1:2, col2:6, col3:4, col4:3 \u2192 [5,2,6,4,3]\n\nPutting all rows together:\n\nRow0: [0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow1: [0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow2: [5,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow3: [5,2,0,4,0]\n\nRow4: [5,2,6,4,3]\n\nBut wait, the test input's rows are 5 rows. Let's see:\n\nWait, the output matrix should have the same number of rows as the input. The test input has 5 rows, so the output should have 5 rows. Let's check if this matches the expected pattern.\n\nWait, but according to our processing:\n\nThe transformed matrix would have rows:\n\nRow0: all zeros\n\nRow1: all zeros\n\nRow2: [5,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow3: [5,2,0,4,0]\n\nRow4: [5,2,6,4,3]\n\nBut let's check if this makes sense. Let's compare with the training examples. For example, in Example0's output, the non-zeros are accumulated at the bottom of each column, and zeros are filled above. So applying that here, yes. But let's check if this is the correct transformation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the order of the non-zero elements. For example, in column0 of the test input, the non-zeros are 5 (row1),5 (row3),5 (row4). When moving to the bottom, they should be placed in the same order but at the bottom. So the column becomes [0,0,5,5,5]. So rows 0,1 are 0, rows 2,3,4 are 5. Similarly for other columns.\n\nSo the final matrix would be:\n\nRow0: 0,0,0,0,0\n\nRow1:0,0,0,0,0\n\nRow2:5,0,0,0,0\n\nRow3:5,2,0,4,0\n\nRow4:5,2,6,4,3\n\nBut let's check if this matches the expected pattern from training examples.\n\nIn Example1's output, the non-zero elements in each column are at the bottom. For instance, in the last column of Example1's output, the 9 is at the bottom. Similarly, in the test case's column4, the 3 is moved to the bottom.\n\nSo the answer should be the matrix with the rows as we constructed. Let's check if this aligns with the given training examples' structure.\n\nYes. So the output should be:\n\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[5, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[5, 2, 0, 4, 0]\n[5, 2, 6, 4, 3]\n\nWait, but in the training examples, sometimes the non-zeros are placed in order. For example, in Example0's second column, input was [4,0,4,0], which became [0,0,4,4]. So the order is preserved. Similarly, in the test column1, the non-zeros are 2 and 2 (from rows0 and3). So in the output column1, they are [0,0,0,2,2]. So the order is preserved. So our processing seems correct.\n\nThus, the final answer for the test input should be:\n\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n[5, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n[5, 2, 0, 4, 0]\n\n[5, 2, 6, 4, 3]\n\nLet me just check once more to avoid mistakes.\n\nAnother way to verify: take each column of the test input, process them, then combine into rows.\n\nColumn0 processed: [0,0,5,5,5]\n\nColumn1: [0,0,0,2,2]\n\nColumn2: [0,0,0,0,6]\n\nColumn3: [0,0,0,4,4]\n\nColumn4: [0,0,0,0,3]\n\nNow, each row is formed by taking the elements from each column at the same row index.\n\nRow0: [0,0,0,0,0] (all columns' first element)\n\nRow1: [0,0,0,0,0] (all columns' second element)\n\nRow2: [5,0,0,0,0] (third elements of each column)\n\nRow3: [5,2,0,4,0] (fourth elements)\n\nRow4: [5,2,6,4,3] (fifth elements)\n\nYes, that looks correct.",

        "cot_2": "Okay, let's tackle this puzzle. I need to figure out the pattern that transforms the input matrices into the output matrices based on the training examples. Let's look at each example step by step.\n\nStarting with Example 0:\n\nInput:\n[0, 4, 0, 9]\n[0, 0, 0, 0]\n[0, 4, 6, 0]\n[1, 0, 0, 0]\n\nOutput:\n[0, 0, 0, 0]\n[0, 0, 0, 0]\n[0, 4, 0, 0]\n[1, 4, 6, 9]\n\nHmm. Let's compare rows. The output's last row has 1,4,6,9 which are numbers from the input's first, third, and fourth rows. For example, the first input row has 4 and 9, third has 4 and 6, and fourth has 1. So maybe the output is consolidating all non-zero numbers into the bottom rows, sorted or ordered in some way.\n\nLooking at Example 1:\n\nInput:\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9]\n[0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0]\n...\n[4, 0, 7, 8, 0, 0]\n[4, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0]\n\nOutput:\n...\n[4, 0, 7, 8, 0, 0]\n[4, 0, 7, 8, 0, 9]\n\nThe non-zero elements in the input's columns are stacked at the bottom. For instance, in the last column of the input, 9 is in the first row. In the output, it's moved to the bottom row. Similarly, in the fourth column, the 8s are stacked in the output's fifth and sixth rows. So maybe each column's non-zero numbers are shifted down to the bottom, maintaining their order but filling from the bottom up, leaving zeros above.\n\nExample 2's input:\n\n[0, 0, 0, 1, 0]\n[0, 3, 0, 0, 0]\n[0, 3, 0, 1, 2]\n[6, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[0, 3, 0, 0, 0]\n\nOutput:\n...\n[6, 3, 0, 1, 2]\n\nLooking at each column:\n\nFirst column: Input has 6 in row 4. Output has 6 in the last row (row5). So 6 moves down.\n\nSecond column: Input has 3s in rows 2,3,5. Output has 3s starting from row3 upwards. So in the output, the 3s are stacked at the bottom. Wait, but in output rows 3,4,5 of column2 are 3,3,3? Let me check. Output's column2 for Example2:\n\nRow1: 0, row2:0, row3:3, row4:3, row5:3. So all the 3s from the input (rows 2,3,5) are moved to the bottom three rows. So each column's non-zero values are moved to the bottom of that column, preserving their order but stacking them starting from the bottom. So for each column, we collect the non-zero numbers in their original order, then place them starting from the bottom row upwards, filling the lower part of the column with those numbers and zeros above.\n\nSo the pattern seems to be: for each column in the input, take all non-zero elements (in their original order) and place them starting from the bottom of the column upwards, filling the rest with zeros above.\n\nLet's verify this with Example 0.\n\nOriginal columns in input:\n\nColumn 1: 0,0,0,1 \u2192 non-zeros [1]. In output column1: 0,0,0,1. So 1 is at the bottom. Correct.\n\nColumn2:4,0,4,0 \u2192 non-zeros [4,4]. In output column2:0,0,4,4. Wait, the output's column2 is [0,0,0,0] in the first two rows, then 4 in row3 and 4 in row4. Wait no. Let me check the output:\n\nExample0's output rows:\n\nRow0: all zeros.\n\nRow1: all zeros.\n\nRow2: 0,4,0,0.\n\nRow3:1,4,6,9.\n\nWait, maybe per column:\n\nLooking at the original input columns:\n\nColumn 1 (all rows, first element):\n\nInput: [0,0,0,1]. Non-zeros: [1]. So output column1 should have 1 at the bottom. Output column1 is [0,0,0,1]. Correct.\n\nColumn2 in input: [4,0,4,0]. Non-zeros [4,4]. So in output column2, these would be placed at the bottom. So the output column2 would have 4 and 4 in the last two rows. Wait, but the output's column2 is [0,0,4,4], but looking at the output rows:\n\nWait the output is:\n\nRow3 (last row) is [1,4,6,9]. So column2 here is 4.\n\nRow2: [0,4,0,0]. So column2 in row2 is 4.\n\nWait, that's for example0's output. So column2 has 4 in row2 and 4 in row3? But the input column2 had 4,0,4,0. So non-zeros are two 4s. In output column2, the 4s are in rows 2 and 3. So that's the third and fourth rows (assuming rows are 0-indexed). Wait, in the output, rows are:\n\nRow0: [0,0,0,0]\n\nRow1: [0,0,0,0]\n\nRow2: [0,4,0,0]\n\nRow3: [1,4,6,9]\n\nSo column2 in output is [0,0,4,4]. Wait, no. Row2's column2 is 4, row3's column2 is 4. So that's two 4s in the bottom two rows of column2. Which matches the input's non-zeros [4,4]. So they are placed at the bottom two positions of the column. The same applies to other columns.\n\nSimilarly, in Example1:\n\nTake the last column. Input has 9 in the first row, 0s elsewhere except the sixth row in input? Let's check input of example1:\n\nThe input is:\n\nRow0: [0,0,0,0,0,9]\n\nRow1: [0,0,0,8,0,0]\n\nRow2: all zeros\n\nRow3: [4,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow4: [4,0,7,8,0,0]\n\nRow5: [4,0,7,0,0,0]\n\nSo the last column (column5) in input is [9,0,0,0,0,0]. So non-zero is 9. Output's column5 is [0,0,0,0,0,9]. So 9 is at the bottom. Correct.\n\nAnother example, column3 in example1's input: entries are 0,8,0,0,8,0. So non-zeros are 8 and8. In output, column3 would have 8 in row4 and 8 in row5? Let's check the output of example1:\n\nRow5: [4,0,7,8,0,9]. So column3 here is 8. Row4's column3 is 8. So yes, both 8s are at the bottom of column3.\n\nSo the pattern is: for each column, collect all non-zero elements in order, then place them starting from the bottom of the column upwards, filling the rest with zeros.\n\nSo to apply this to the test input:\n\nTest Input:\nRow0: [0,2,0,4,3]\nRow1: [5,0,0,0,0]\nRow2: [0,0,6,0,0]\nRow3: [5,2,0,4,0]\nRow4: [5,0,0,0,0]\n\nSo each column needs to be processed.\n\nLet's process each column one by one.\n\nColumns are 0 to 4 (since each row has 5 elements).\n\nColumn 0:\n\nValues from each row (rows 0 to 4):\n\nRow0:0\n\nRow1:5\n\nRow2:0\n\nRow3:5\n\nRow4:5\n\nNon-zeros: 5,5,5 (from rows1,3,4). So collect them in order [5,5,5]. Then place them starting from the bottom of the column. So the bottom three rows (rows2,3,4?) Wait, the column has 5 rows. Wait, rows are 0,1,2,3,4. So column0 has entries in rows 0-4. So the bottom of the column is row4, then row3, etc.\n\nSo non-zeros are [5 (row1), 5 (row3), 5 (row4)]. Wait, but the order in the input column is:\n\nRow0:0\n\nRow1:5\n\nRow2:0\n\nRow3:5\n\nRow4:5\n\nSo the non-zeros are in the order 5 (row1), 5 (row3), 5 (row4). So when we collect them, they are [5,5,5]. Then, when placing from the bottom up, we start at the bottom of the column (row4) and fill upwards. So the bottom three rows (row4, row3, row2) would get these values. Wait, no: the column has 5 positions. So for three non-zero values, they should occupy the bottom three positions. So row4, row3, row2 would be 5,5,5? Or row4, row3, row2 in reverse?\n\nWait, the order of the non-zero elements in the input column is 5 (from row1), then 5 (row3), then 5 (row4). So when we collect them, the order is [5,5,5], but since we are placing them from the bottom up, the last element in the collected list (5 from row4) would go to the bottom (row4), then the previous (5 from row3) goes to row3, and 5 from row1 goes to row2. But that would reverse the order. Wait, but in the training examples, did the order matter?\n\nLooking back at Example0's column2: the input non-zeros were [4 (row0),4 (row2)], and the output column2 is [0,0,4,4]. So the order is preserved. Wait, no. Because in the input, the non-zeros are in rows0 and2 (column2). So collected as [4,4]. When placed from the bottom, row3 and row2. So in output, row3's column2 is 4, and row2's column2 is 4. So the order is preserved. So the first non-zero (4 from row0) is placed at the next available position from the bottom. Wait, that seems reversed. Because in the input, the order of non-zeros is 4,4 (row0 and row2). When placed in the output column from the bottom up, the first non-zero (4 from row0) would go to the higher position. Wait, maybe the order is preserved when stacking from bottom up. Let's see:\n\nIf the non-zeros are in order [a, b, c], then in the output column, they would be placed starting from the bottom, so the last element in the list is at the very bottom. Wait, no. Let's think of a column with 4 rows. Suppose the non-zeros are [A, B], collected in the order they appear from top to bottom. Then when placing from the bottom up, the first element A would be placed in the second to last row, and B in the last row. So the order is preserved.\n\nWait, in example0's column2:\n\nInput non-zeros are 4 (row0) and 4 (row2). So list [4,4]. Placing from bottom up (rows3,2,1,0). So the bottom two rows are row3 and row2. So the first 4 (from row0) is placed in row2, and the next 4 (from row2) is placed in row3. So the output column becomes [0,0,4,4] (rows0,1,2,3). So the order of the non-zeros is preserved. So in the output, the first non-zero (4 from row0) is higher up than the next (4 from row2), which is lower. So the order is preserved. So the list of non-zeros is placed in the same order starting from the bottom of the column, pushing upwards. Wait, maybe the correct approach is to take the non-zero elements in their original order (top to bottom) and then place them starting from the bottom of the column. So for example, if the non-zero list is [a, b, c], then in the output column, the last element (c) is placed at the very bottom, then b above it, then a above that. That would reverse the order. But in example0's column2, the order was preserved. So perhaps the non-zeros are placed in the same order starting from the bottom, but as many as fit. Wait, no. Because in example0's column2, the non-zeros are [4,4], and in the output, they are placed in the same order as [4,4] in the bottom two rows (rows2 and3?), but the output shows row2 as 4 and row3 as 4. So the order is preserved. So first non-zero (from row0) is placed at the lower position (row2?), and the next (from row2) at row3. That doesn't make sense. Wait, maybe the rows are zero-indexed. So in example0's output, the third row (index3) is the last row. The column2 has in output rows:\n\nRow0:0\n\nRow1:0\n\nRow2:4\n\nRow3:4\n\nSo the non-zeros [4,4] are placed in row2 and row3, which are the bottom two rows. But in the input, the first 4 is in row0, the second in row2. So the order of non-zeros is preserved when placing from top to bottom in the column. Wait, but when you place from the bottom, the first non-zero would be placed at the bottommost available spot. So for the list [4,4], you place the first 4 (from row0) at the second to last row (row2), and the second 4 (from row2) at the last row (row3). So the order is preserved. Because the first element in the non-zero list is placed above the second in the column.\n\nSo in general, for each column, the non-zero elements are collected in the order they appear from top to bottom, and then placed in the same order starting from the bottom of the column upwards. Wait, but that would require that the first non-zero in the input column is placed higher than the subsequent ones. For example, in a column with 4 rows, non-zeros in rows0 and2 (elements A and B), collected in order [A,B]. Then placed starting from the bottom: B goes to row3, A to row2. But that would reverse the order. But in example0's output, the order is preserved. So I must have made a mistake here.\n\nLet me re-examine example0's column2:\n\nInput column2 is [4,0,4,0]. So non-zeros are 4 (row0) and4 (row2). Collected as [4,4]. Then in the output, column2 is [0,0,4,4]. So rows2 and3. The first element of the list (4 from row0) is placed in row2, the second (4 from row2) in row3. So the order is preserved. So when placing, we start from the bottom and fill upwards, but the order is preserved. How? If the non-zero list is [A,B,C], then in the output column, the bottom positions are filled with C, B, A. But in the example, it's [A,B] \u2192 [A,B] in the bottom two rows. That seems contradictory. Wait, perhaps the non-zeros are pushed down to the bottom, maintaining their relative order. So the first non-zero encountered in the column (from top to bottom) is placed in the earliest possible bottom row. Wait, maybe it's easier to think of it as stacking the non-zeros in the same order at the bottom of the column, pushing them down as much as possible. So the first non-zero in the input column is placed in the first available position from the bottom. Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to take all non-zeros in the column, then reverse their order and place them from the bottom up. Let's test this.\n\nExample0's column2: non-zeros [4,4]. Reversed would be [4,4]. Placed from bottom up, so first 4 (from row2) in row3, next 4 (from row0) in row2. So the output would be [0,0,4,4]. Which matches the example. Wait, but reversed the list. So the non-zero list is reversed when placing. Hmm, but in example1's column3:\n\nInput column3 in example1 has non-zeros 8 (row1) and8 (row4). So list [8,8]. Reversed would be [8,8]. Placed in column3 of output as row5 and row4. But in example1's output, the fifth row (row5) has 8 in column3, and row4 also has 8. So the output's column3 is [8,8], but in the same order as input. Wait, no. Input's column3 is [0 (row0), 8 (row1), 0,0,8 (row4),0 (row5)]. So non-zeros are 8 (row1), 8 (row4). So list [8,8]. Reversed would be [8,8]. Placed from the bottom up: row5 and row4. But in the output, row4's column3 is 8, and row5's column3 is8? Or no, the output's fifth row (row5) is [4,0,7,8,0,9], so column3 (index3) is 8. Row4's column3 is 8 as well. So they are both 8s. So the order is preserved. Wait, but if we reverse [8,8], it's same as original. So perhaps the order is preserved. So in this case, reversing doesn't change the order.\n\nAnother example: Example2's column1:\n\nInput column1:\n\nRow0:0\n\nRow1:3\n\nRow2:3\n\nRow3:0\n\nRow4:3\n\nNon-zeros:3,3,3 (from rows1,2,4). So list [3,3,3]. Placed from the bottom up. Output column1 should be [0,0,3,3,3]. Which matches the output. So the order is preserved. So the non-zeros are placed starting from the bottom of the column, but in the same order as they appear in the input. So the first non-zero (from the top) is placed in the earliest possible position from the bottom. For example, if there are three non-zeros in a column of five rows, they would be placed in rows3,4,5 (if 0-based, rows2,3,4?), but let's check.\n\nWait, in Example2's column1, the output has 3s in rows2,3,4 (0-based). So the bottom three rows. So the first non-zero (row1) is placed in row2 (third from top), the next (row2) in row3, and the next (row4) in row4. So they are placed in the same order, starting from the bottom upwards. Wait, the first non-zero (row1) is placed in the third position (row2) from the top. But how does that work? Maybe the approach is: collect all non-zeros in the column, then place them in the same order starting from the bottom of the column. So the first element in the non-zero list is placed at the first available position from the bottom. For example, in a column with 5 rows and 3 non-zeros:\n\nnon-zeros = [a, b, c]\n\nThen, the bottom three rows would be rows4,3,2 (0-based). So c (last element) is placed in row4, b in row3, a in row2. Wait, but that would reverse the order. But in Example2's case, the non-zeros are [3,3,3], so it's the same. But in Example0's column2, non-zeros are [4,4]. Placed in rows2 and3. So the first 4 (from row0) is in row2, and the next (from row2) in row3. So the order is preserved.\n\nThis suggests that the non-zeros are placed in the same order from top to bottom, but shifted down as far as possible. So for each column, the non-zero elements are pushed down to the bottom, maintaining their original order, and filling the lower part of the column, with zeros above.\n\nSo the process is:\n\nFor each column:\n\n1. Collect all non-zero elements in order from top to bottom.\n\n2. Create a new column where these non-zero elements are placed at the bottom, maintaining their order, with zeros filling the remaining spaces above.\n\nSo, for example, if a column has elements [0, a, 0, b], then the non-zeros are [a, b]. The new column would be [0,0, a, b].\n\nAnother example: [c, 0, d, e] \u2192 non-zeros [c,d,e] \u2192 new column [0, c, d, e] \u2192 no, wait, no. Wait, if the original column is [c,0,d,e], then non-zeros are c (row0), d (row2), e (row3). So list [c, d, e]. The new column should have them at the bottom. Since there are four rows, and three non-zeros, the new column would have zeros in the first row, then c, d, e in rows1,2,3. But that's not pushing to the bottom. Wait, no. If the column is four rows, then the non-zeros should be placed starting from the last row (row3) upwards. So for three non-zeros, they would occupy rows3,2,1. But in the original order, [c,d,e], the first non-zero c is in row0. So when pushing to the bottom, the new column would have zeros in row0, then c in row1, d in row2, e in row3. That can't be right. Wait, maybe the correct approach is to take the non-zero elements and place them starting from the bottom of the column. So for [c,0,d,e], non-zeros are c, d, e. Place them starting from the bottom. So e (from row3) goes to row3, d (row2) to row2, c (row0) to row1. But that would reverse the order. So the new column would be [0, c, d, e], but the order is preserved. Wait, no. How?\n\nAlternatively, think of the column as having all non-zeros moved down, like gravity. So if there are zeros below them, they fall down. So for example, in a column [0, a, 0, b], the a and b would fall to the bottom. So the new column would be [0,0, a, b]. Similarly, [c,0,d,e] would become [0, c, d, e], because the c is above zeros and falls down. But the order in this case is preserved. Wait, but in this example, the non-zeros are c, d, e. When they fall down, c moves down past the zero below it. So the original column:\n\nrow0: c\n\nrow1: 0\n\nrow2: d\n\nrow3: e\n\nAfter moving down, the non-zeros would collect at the bottom. So the new column would be [0, c, d, e]. But how? Because c is in row0, which can fall down to row1 (since row1 is 0), then to row2 (if possible). But there's d in row2. So c can't fall past d. So in this case, the non-zero elements would stack as [c, d, e], but in their original positions, but any zeros below them allow them to fall. Wait, maybe the process is similar to the \"gravity\" effect in games like 2048, where tiles fall down to the lowest empty spot. So for each column, starting from the bottom, you move each non-zero down as far as possible.\n\nLet me think with the first example:\n\nExample0's column2 input:\n\nrows:0:4, 1:0, 2:4, 3:0.\n\nProcessing column from bottom to top:\n\nStart at the bottom (row3). It's 0, so look above for non-zero. The next up is row2:4. Move 4 down to row3. Now row2 becomes 0. Then check row1:0. Then row0:4. Move this 4 down to row2 (since row1 is 0). So the column becomes [0,0,0,4] after moving row0's 4 to row2. But then the row2's 4 (originally from row0) can move further down? Since row3 is now 4 (from row2's original 4). Wait, this is getting complicated.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the correct approach is to collect all non-zeros in order and then fill them from the bottom. So for column processing:\n\nCollect all non-zeros in the order they appear from top to bottom.\n\nThen, create a new column of the same length, filled with zeros.\n\nStarting from the bottom of the new column, fill in the non-zeros in the order they were collected.\n\nWait, for example, if the column has 4 elements and the non-zeros are [4,4], then the new column would have zeros in the first two positions and then the non-zeros in the last two. So [0,0,4,4].\n\nIf the non-zeros are [5,5,5] in a 5-row column, then new column would have zeros in the first two positions and then 5,5,5. So for the test input's column0:\n\nnon-zeros are [5 (row1),5 (row3),5 (row4)].\n\nCollect them in order: [5,5,5].\n\nThen, in the new column, starting from the bottom, place them. The new column has 5 rows. The bottom three positions are rows4,3,2. So fill them with 5,5,5. So the new column would be [0,0,5,5,5]. But wait, the collected non-zeros are [5,5,5]. If we place them starting from the bottom, the last element (5 from row4) would go to row4, then the previous (5 from row3) to row3, then 5 from row1 to row2. So the new column would be [0,0,5,5,5]. But the original non-zeros are [5,5,5], so the order is preserved. So the new column would have the first 5 (from row1) at row2, next at row3, next at row4. Which would give [0,0,5,5,5].\n\nSo applying this to the test input's column0:\n\nOriginal column0: [0,5,0,5,5]. Non-zeros [5,5,5]. New column0: [0,0,5,5,5].\n\nSo column0's output would have 5 in rows2,3,4.\n\nNow let's process each column of the test input:\n\nTest Input:\n\nRow0: [0,2,0,4,3]\n\nRow1: [5,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow2: [0,0,6,0,0]\n\nRow3: [5,2,0,4,0]\n\nRow4: [5,0,0,0,0]\n\nColumns 0 to4:\n\nColumn0:\n\nValues:\n\nRow0:0\n\nRow1:5\n\nRow2:0\n\nRow3:5\n\nRow4:5\n\nNon-zeros:5,5,5 \u2192 new column0: [0,0,5,5,5]\n\nSo the processed column0 would be:\n\nRow0:0\n\nRow1:0\n\nRow2:5\n\nRow3:5\n\nRow4:5\n\nColumn1:\n\nValues:\n\nRow0:2\n\nRow1:0\n\nRow2:0\n\nRow3:2\n\nRow4:0\n\nNon-zeros:2 (row0), 2 (row3) \u2192 new column1: [0,0,0,2,2] ?\n\nWait, the column has 5 rows. Non-zeros are two 2s. So new column would have zeros in rows0,1,2, and then 2,2 in rows3 and4.\n\nWait, but according to the pattern, we collect the non-zeros in order and place them at the bottom. So the two 2s would be placed in the bottom two rows (rows3 and4?), but no, wait:\n\nThe column has 5 rows (0-4). The non-zeros are [2,2]. So in the new column, they should be placed at the bottom two positions: rows3 and4. But the original order is row0 and row3. So collected as [2,2]. Place them in rows3 and4? Or rows4 and3?\n\nNo, according to the pattern, they should be placed in the same order starting from the bottom. So the first 2 (from row0) would go to row3 (second to last), and the second 2 (from row3) to row4 (last). So the new column1 would be [0,0,0,2,2].\n\nWait, but that's 2 in row3 and 2 in row4. But the non-zeros are [2,2], so when placing from the bottom up, the first element of the list is placed at the next available position from the bottom. So for two non-zeros in a 5-row column, the bottom two rows (rows3 and4). So the first 2 (from row0) goes to row3, the second 2 (from row3) goes to row4. So the new column1 is [0,0,0,2,2].\n\nSo column1 becomes:\n\nRow0:0\n\nRow1:0\n\nRow2:0\n\nRow3:2\n\nRow4:2\n\nColumn2:\n\nValues:\n\nRow0:0\n\nRow1:0\n\nRow2:6\n\nRow3:0\n\nRow4:0\n\nNon-zeros:6 (row2) \u2192 new column2: [0,0,0,0,6]. Because it's a single non-zero, placed at the bottom row (row4).\n\nWait, no. The column has 5 rows. The non-zero is in row2. So when processed, it should be moved to the bottom. So the new column2 would have 6 in row4, and zeros elsewhere. So new column2: [0,0,0,0,6].\n\nBut wait, according to the pattern, collect all non-zeros (only 6) and place them starting from the bottom. So row4 gets 6. Yes.\n\nColumn3:\n\nValues:\n\nRow0:4\n\nRow1:0\n\nRow2:0\n\nRow3:4\n\nRow4:0\n\nNon-zeros:4 (row0),4 (row3) \u2192 list [4,4]. New column3 would have zeros in rows0,1,2, and 4,4 in rows3 and4. So new column3: [0,0,0,4,4].\n\nColumn4:\n\nValues:\n\nRow0:3\n\nRow1:0\n\nRow2:0\n\nRow3:0\n\nRow4:0\n\nNon-zeros:3 (row0) \u2192 new column4: [0,0,0,0,3].\n\nNow, combining all processed columns into rows:\n\nProcessed columns:\n\nColumn0: [0,0,5,5,5]\n\nColumn1: [0,0,0,2,2]\n\nColumn2: [0,0,0,0,6]\n\nColumn3: [0,0,0,4,4]\n\nColumn4: [0,0,0,0,3]\n\nNow, to convert these columns back into rows:\n\nEach row is constructed by taking the elements from each column's processed array at the same index.\n\nFor example:\n\nRow0 of the output is [column0[0], column1[0], column2[0], column3[0], column4[0]] \u2192 [0,0,0,0,0].\n\nRow1: [0,0,0,0,0].\n\nRow2: [5,0,0,0,0].\n\nRow3: [5,2,0,4,0].\n\nRow4: [5,2,6,4,3].\n\nWait, but let's check:\n\nFor column0, the processed array is [0,0,5,5,5]. So row0 (index0) is 0, row1 is 0, row2 is5, row3 is5, row4 is5.\n\nColumn1 processed: [0,0,0,2,2]. So row0:0, row1:0, row2:0, row3:2, row4:2.\n\nColumn2: [0,0,0,0,6]. So row0-3:0, row4:6.\n\nColumn3: [0,0,0,4,4]. Row3:4, row4:4.\n\nColumn4: [0,0,0,0,3]. Row4:3.\n\nSo combining:\n\nRow0: [0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow1: [0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow2: [5,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow3: [5,2,0,4,0]\n\nRow4: [5,2,6,4,3]\n\nBut wait, the test input has five rows. The output should be a matrix with these rows. Let's check if this matches the pattern seen in the training examples.\n\nBut let me compare with the test input and expected output.\n\nThe test input is:\n\n[0,2,0,4,3]\n\n[5,0,0,0,0]\n\n[0,0,6,0,0]\n\n[5,2,0,4,0]\n\n[5,0,0,0,0]\n\nThe processed output according to our analysis is:\n\nRow0: [0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow1: [0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow2: [5,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow3: [5,2,0,4,0]\n\nRow4: [5,2,6,4,3]\n\nYes, this seems correct. All non-zeros are shifted to the bottom of each respective column, maintaining their order. For example, column0 has three 5s at the bottom three rows. Column1 has two 2s at the bottom two rows. Column2 has 6 at the bottom. Column3 has two 4s at the bottom. Column4 has 3 at the bottom.\n\nThis matches the pattern observed in the training examples."
