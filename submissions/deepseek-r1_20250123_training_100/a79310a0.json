        "cot_1": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. So, the problem is about transforming an input matrix into an output matrix based on some hidden rule. Let's look at the training examples to see what's going on.\n\nStarting with Example 0. The input has two rows of [8,8,0,0,0], then three rows of zeros. The output changes those top two rows. The first input row becomes all zeros, the second becomes [2,2,0,0,0], and the third becomes [2,2,0,0,0]. The rest are zeros. Hmm. So where did those 2s come from?\n\nLooking at Example 1: the input has a single 8 in the first row, second column. The output has a 2 in the second row, same column. So maybe the 8 is moving down? Like, each 8 in the input is being shifted down one row and turned into a 2. But in Example 0, there are two 8s in the first row. In the output, they become 2s in the second and third rows. Wait, maybe each 8 is duplicated below?\n\nWait, Example 0's input has two rows with [8,8,...]. The output's second and third rows have [2,2,...]. So each 8 in the input is converted into a 2 in the same column but in the next row. But in Example 0, the first two rows of input have 8s. Let me check:\n\nOriginal input rows 0 and 1 (0-based) are [8,8,0,0,0]. Output rows 1 and 2 become [2,2,0,0,0]. So each 8 in row i is moving to row i+1 as a 2. But if there are multiple 8s in adjacent rows, maybe they stack? Like in Example 0, the two original rows of 8s are converted into two rows of 2s, shifted down by one. So the first input row's 8s become row 1 in output (since the output's row 1 is [2,2...], and the input's row 1's 8s become row 2 in output. So each 8 in row i becomes a 2 in row i+1, and if there's another 8 in row i+1, it's also converted. So overlapping would add up?\n\nWait, maybe the rule is that for each 8 in the input, the cell directly below it (if within bounds) becomes a 2 in the output. And the original 8s are replaced by 0s. Let's test that.\n\nExample 0: The first two rows have 8s. Each 8 in row 0 would make the cell below (row 1) a 2. Similarly, the 8s in row 1 would make the cell below (row 2) a 2. But the output's row 1 and 2 have 2s. So in the input, row 0 has 8s in columns 0 and 1. So in output row 1, columns 0 and 1 become 2. Then input row 1 also has 8s in same columns. So output row 2, columns 0 and 1 get 2s. So that matches the output of Example 0.\n\nExample 1: The input has an 8 in row 0, column 1. So output row 1, column 1 becomes 2. The rest are zeros. Which matches the output.\n\nExample 2: Input has a row 1 with 8s in columns 1,2,3. So output row 2 would have 2s in those columns. Which matches the output given.\n\nSo the pattern seems to be: each 8 in the input matrix is replaced by a 0, and the cell directly below it (if it exists) is set to 2. If multiple 8s are above the same cell, maybe they add up. Wait, but in Example 0, input row 0 and 1 both have 8s in column 0. So row 1's 8 would set row 2's column 0 to 2, but since row 0's 8 is in column 0, it would set row 1's column 0 to 2. So the output for Example 0 has row 1 and 2 with 2s, which is exactly that. So each 8 in row i, column j adds a 2 to row i+1, column j. The original 8s are turned into 0s.\n\nSo the transformation is:\n\n- For every cell in the input matrix, if it is 8, set it to 0 in the output, and add 2 to the cell directly below it (if there is one). If multiple 8s are above the same cell, their contributions sum up. Wait, but in the examples, there's no case where two 8s are stacked vertically. For example, if there's an 8 in row 0, column 0, and another 8 in row 1, column 0, then row 1's 8 would turn into 0, and row 2's column 0 would get a 2 from the row 1's 8. But the row 0's 8 would contribute a 2 to row 1's column 0. So in the output, row 1's column 0 would be 2 (from row 0's 8) plus 0 (since the original row 1's 8 is now 0). Wait, but in Example 0, the original row 0 and 1 both have 8s. So in the output, row 1's column 0 is 2 (from row 0's 8), and row 2's column 0 is 2 (from row 1's 8). So yes, each 8 contributes to the cell below.\n\nSo applying this rule to the test input:\n\nTest Input:\n\nRow 0: [0, 0, 8, 0, 0]\nRow 1: [0, 8, 8, 0, 0]\nRow 2: [0, 0, 8, 0, 0]\nRow 3: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\nRow 4: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nLet's process each cell:\n\nFirst, row 0:\n\nColumn 2 has an 8. So output row 0, column 2 becomes 0. Then row 1, column 2 gets 2 added.\n\nRow 1:\n\nColumns 1 and 2 have 8s. So output row 1, columns 1 and 2 become 0. Then row 2, columns 1 and 2 get 2 each.\n\nRow 2:\n\nColumn 2 has 8. So output row 2, column 2 becomes 0, and row 3, column 2 gets 2.\n\nRows 3 and 4: no 8s.\n\nNow, collect all the added 2s:\n\nRow 1, column 2: +2 from row 0's 8.\n\nRow 2: column 1: +2 from row 1's column 1 8.\n\nRow 2: column 2: +2 from row 1's column 2 8 and another +2 from row 2's own 8 (which would affect row 3, column 2).\n\nWait, no. Wait, for each 8 in the input, the cell directly below it (if exists) is set to 2. So:\n\nRow 0, column 2: 8 \u2192 output row 0, column 2 becomes 0, and row 1, column 2 gets 2.\n\nRow 1, column 1: 8 \u2192 output row 1, column 1 becomes 0, row 2, column 1 gets 2.\n\nRow 1, column 2: 8 \u2192 output row 1, column 2 becomes 0, row 2, column 2 gets 2.\n\nRow 2, column 2: 8 \u2192 output row 2, column 2 becomes 0, row 3, column 2 gets 2.\n\nSo the output matrix:\n\nOriginal cells are all 0 except where 8s were, which are 0 now. Then, the added 2s are:\n\nRow 1, column 2: 2.\n\nRow 2, columns 1 and 2: 2 each.\n\nRow 3, column 2: 2.\n\nOther cells remain 0.\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\nRow 0: all 0s.\n\nRow 1: [0,0,2,0,0] (from row 0's 8 in column 2). But wait, original row 1's 8s (columns 1 and 2) are now 0. So row 1's entries are 0 except where 2s were added from above. Wait no, the 2s are added to the row below. Wait, no. Wait, for each 8 in row i, column j, the cell (i+1, j) in output becomes 2 (or adds 2 if multiple 8s contribute). So for row 0, column 2, the cell below is row 1, column 2 \u2192 2.\n\nRow 1, column 1: cell below is row 2, column 1 \u2192 2.\n\nRow 1, column 2: cell below is row 2, column 2 \u2192 2.\n\nRow 2, column 2: cell below is row 3, column 2 \u2192 2.\n\nSo the output matrix:\n\nRow 0: [0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow 1: [0,0,2,0,0] \u2192 but wait, the original row 1's 8s are now 0. But the 2 from row 0's 8 is in row 1, column 2. Also, the 8s in row 1 contribute to row 2. So row 1's 8s (columns 1 and 2) are turned into 0, but their effect is on row 2.\n\nSo row 1's output is [0,0 (since their 8s are now 0, but the 2 from row 0's 8 is in column 2) \u2192 so row 1: [0,0,2,0,0].\n\nRow 2: from row 1's columns 1 and 2, which added 2s here. So columns 1 and 2 are 2 each. So row 2: [0,2,2,0,0].\n\nRow 3: from row 2's column 2's 8, which adds a 2 here. So [0,0,2,0,0].\n\nRow 4: all 0s.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nOutput matrix:\n\n[0,0,0,0,0]\n\n[0,0,2,0,0]\n\n[0,2,2,0,0]\n\n[0,0,2,0,0]\n\n[0,0,0,0,0]\n\nWait, but let me check the examples again. For example, in Example 0, the output's row 1 and 2 both have 2s where the input's two rows of 8s were. Each 8 in row i contributes to row i+1.\n\nSo applying the same logic here, the test input's output should be:\n\nRow 0: 0s.\n\nRow 1: 2 in column 2 (from row 0's 8).\n\nRow 2: 2 in column 1 (from row 1's 8 in column 1) and 2 in column 2 (from row 1's 8 in column 2).\n\nRow 3: 2 in column 2 (from row 2's 8).\n\nSo the rows:\n\nRow 0: [0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow 1: [0,0,2,0,0]\n\nRow 2: [0,2,2,0,0]\n\nRow 3: [0,0,2,0,0]\n\nRow 4: [0,0,0,0,0]\n\nBut let me check if that's correct. Let's see.\n\nOriginal test input:\n\nRow 0: [0, 0, 8, 0, 0] \u2192 8 at (0,2) \u2192 becomes 0, adds 2 to (1,2).\n\nRow 1: [0, 8, 8, 0, 0] \u2192 8s at (1,1) and (1,2) \u2192 become 0, add 2s to (2,1) and (2,2).\n\nRow 2: [0, 0, 8, 0, 0] \u2192 8 at (2,2) \u2192 becomes 0, adds 2 to (3,2).\n\nSo in the output:\n\nRow 0: all 0s.\n\nRow 1: only (1,2) has 2.\n\nRow 2: (2,1) and (2,2) have 2 each.\n\nRow 3: (3,2) has 2.\n\nRow 4: all 0s.\n\nSo the output matrix should look like that.\n\nSo the final output is:\n\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n[0, 0, 2, 0, 0]\n\n[0, 2, 2, 0, 0]\n\n[0, 0, 2, 0, 0]\n\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nYes, that makes sense. Let me check if this matches the training examples' pattern.\n\nIn Example 1, input has 8 at (0,1) \u2192 output 2 at (1,1). So same pattern.\n\nIn Example 2, input has 8s in row 1, columns 1-3 \u2192 output has 2s in row 2, columns 1-3.\n\nSo applying this pattern to the test input gives the output as above.",

        "cot_2": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. So, looking at the training examples, the input is a grid of numbers, and the output is another grid. The first step is to see how the input transforms into the output.\n\nStarting with Example 0. The input has two rows of [8,8,0,0,0], and the rest are zeros. The output has two rows of [2,2,0,0,0] shifted down by one row. So maybe the 8s are moving down and turning into 2s? But how?\n\nIn Example 1, the input is a 3x3 grid with an 8 in the top middle. The output has a 2 in the middle of the second row. So the 8 in (0,1) becomes a 2 in (1,1). So it moved down one row, same column. And the original 8 is replaced by 0? Wait, no, in the input, the 8 is in the first row, and in the output, it's gone, replaced by 0, and the 2 is in the next row. So perhaps each 8 is moving down one cell, turning into a 2, and then the original 8 is removed.\n\nBut wait, in Example 0, there are two 8s in the first two rows. The output has 2s in the second and third rows. Wait, original input rows 0 and 1 both have 8s. The output has 2s in rows 1 and 2. So each 8 moves down by one row, but if there's already an 8 below, maybe they stack? Or perhaps each 8 in the input is converted into a 2 in the cell directly below, and the original 8 is set to 0. But then, in Example 0, the two 8s in the first two rows would each move down. Wait, the first row (row 0) moves down to row 1, and the second row (row 1) moves down to row 2. So the output has 2s in rows 1 and 2, but in the example output, it's [2,2] in row 1 and 2. But the original input had two rows with [8,8], so moving each down by one would create two rows of 2s. That matches the output.\n\nIn Example 2, the input has three 8s in row 1 (columns 1,2,3). The output has 2s in row 2, same columns. So each 8 moves down one row, turning into a 2. So the pattern seems to be: every 8 in the input moves down one cell (row +1, same column), becomes a 2, and the original position becomes 0. But if moving down would go out of bounds, perhaps it's ignored? Or maybe it's allowed to wrap around? But in the examples, moving down doesn't go out of bounds. Let's check.\n\nIn Example 0, the first two rows have 8s. Moving down from row 0 to 1, which is valid. Then moving from row 1 to 2, which is also valid. The output 2s are in rows 1 and 2. So yes. Example 1: 8 in row 0 moves to row 1. Example 2: 8s in row 1 move to row 2. So the rule is: each 8 in the input is replaced by a 0, and a 2 is placed in the cell directly below (same column, next row). But if there are multiple 8s in the same column, how does that work? Let's see.\n\nLooking at the Test Input. Let's parse it:\n\nTest Input:\nRow 0: [0, 0, 8, 0, 0]\nRow 1: [0, 8, 8, 0, 0]\nRow 2: [0, 0, 8, 0, 0]\nRow 3: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\nRow 4: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nSo the 8s are at:\n(0,2), (1,1), (1,2), (2,2)\n\nEach of these should move down by one row. Let's process each:\n\n- (0,2) \u2192 (1,2) becomes 2. But in the input row 1, there's already 8s at (1,1) and (1,2). But according to the transformation, the original 8s in row 1 would also move down. So perhaps we need to process all 8s first, then place the 2s.\n\nWait, if the 8s in row 1 (current) move down to row 2. So row 1's 8s (columns 1 and 2) would become 2s in row 2. But the original row 2 has an 8 in column 2. So that 8 would move down to row 3. Let's process each 8 in order:\n\nOriginal positions (row, column):\n\n- (0,2): move to (1,2) \u2192 2\n- (1,1): move to (2,1) \u2192 2\n- (1,2): move to (2,2) \u2192 2\n- (2,2): move to (3,2) \u2192 2\n\nSo all these positions would become 2 in the row below. Then, the original 8s are set to 0.\n\nSo the output would be:\n\nRow 0: all 0s except (0,2) becomes 0, since it's moved to row 1.\n\nRow 1: original 8s at (1,1) and (1,2) become 0. But there's a 2 coming from (0,2) into (1,2). So row 1 would have 0,0,2,0,0? Wait, no. Wait, each 8 in the original input is processed. So all 8s in the input are replaced by 0, and then their positions are used to create 2s one row below.\n\nSo the process is:\n\n1. For each cell in the input grid:\n   a. If the cell is 8, replace it with 0.\n   b. Then, in the cell below (same column, row+1), set it to 2. If that cell is out of bounds, ignore.\n\nBut in the case where two 8s are in the same column but adjacent rows, like in Example 0, where row 0 and 1 have 8s in the same column, when moving down, they would both add 2s to the next row. For example, row 0's 8 would add a 2 to row 1, and row 1's 8 would add a 2 to row 2. So the output rows 1 and 2 get the 2s.\n\nSo applying this to the test input:\n\nOriginal 8s:\n\nRow 0, column 2 \u2192 add 2 to row 1, column 2.\n\nRow 1, column 1 \u2192 add 2 to row 2, column 1.\n\nRow 1, column 2 \u2192 add 2 to row 2, column 2.\n\nRow 2, column 2 \u2192 add 2 to row 3, column 2.\n\nSo all these 8s are turned to 0 in their original positions, and the cells below get 2s.\n\nSo the output grid would be:\n\nRow 0: all 0s (original 8 at (0,2) is now 0).\n\nRow 1: in column 2, the 2 comes from the 8 above. But original row 1's 8s are now 0, so row 1 becomes [0,0,2,0,0].\n\nRow 2: has 2s from the 8s in row 1 (columns 1 and 2) and the 8 in row 2's column 2 would add to row 3. So row 2 would have [0,2,2,0,0].\n\nRow 3: the 8 in row 2, column 2 adds a 2 here \u2192 [0,0,2,0,0].\n\nRow 4: all 0s.\n\nBut wait, let's check the Test Input's structure. Let's list each row after processing:\n\nOriginal Test Input:\n\nRow 0: 0,0,8,0,0 \u2192 after replacing 8 with 0 \u2192 0,0,0,0,0. Then add 2 to row 1, column 2.\n\nRow 1: 0,8,8,0,0 \u2192 replace 8s with 0 \u2192 0,0,0,0,0. Add 2 to row 2, column 1 and row 2, column 2.\n\nRow 2: 0,0,8,0,0 \u2192 replace 8 with 0 \u2192 0,0,0,0,0. Add 2 to row 3, column 2.\n\nRow 3: all 0s. No changes from here.\n\nRow 4: all 0s.\n\nSo after processing all 8s:\n\nThe cells that get 2s are:\n\nRow 1, column 2 (from row 0's 8).\n\nRow 2, columns 1 and 2 (from row 1's 8s).\n\nRow 3, column 2 (from row 2's 8).\n\nAll other cells are 0.\n\nSo the output grid would look like:\n\nRow 0: [0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow 1: [0,0,2,0,0]\n\nRow 2: [0,2,2,0,0]\n\nRow 3: [0,0,2,0,0]\n\nRow 4: [0,0,0,0,0]\n\nWait, but let me check the training examples again. For instance, Example 2's input has three 8s in row 1. The output has them moved to row 2. So each 8 moves down one. So the transformation is indeed each 8 moves down one row, becomes 2, original becomes 0.\n\nSo applying this logic, the Test Input's output should have:\n\nRow 0: all 0s.\n\nRow 1: 2 at column 2 (from row 0's 8).\n\nRow 2: 2s at columns 1 and 2 (from row 1's 8s).\n\nRow 3: 2 at column 2 (from row 2's 8).\n\nRow 4: all 0s.\n\nSo the output grid would be:\n\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n[0, 0, 2, 0, 0]\n\n[0, 2, 2, 0, 0]\n\n[0, 0, 2, 0, 0]\n\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nBut looking at the training examples, the outputs are centered when possible. Wait, in Example 0, the two 8s in the first two rows become 2s in the next rows. So in the output, the 2s are in rows 1 and 2, forming two layers. Similarly, in the Test Input, the 2s are in rows 1, 2, and 3. So the answer should have those positions."
