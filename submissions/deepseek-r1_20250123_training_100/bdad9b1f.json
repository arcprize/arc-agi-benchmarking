        "cot_1": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. So, looking at the training examples.\n\nStarting with Example 0. The input has some numbers and the output changes them in a certain way. Let's compare the input and output.\n\nIn the input, the first two rows are [0,0,0,0,8,0] repeated. The third row is [2,2,0,0,0,0], and the rest are all zeros. The output then has the third row expanded to [2,2,2,2,4,2], and rows 3,4,5 (0-based?) turn into [0,0,...8,0] again. Wait, no. Wait, the output for Example 0's output is:\n\nRows 0 and 1 remain the same as input. Then row 2 becomes [2,2,2,2,4,2], rows 3,4,5 are [0,0,0,0,8,0] each. Hmm. So the 8s in column 4 (index 4) are present in rows 0 and 1 in input, and in output, they spread to rows 3,4,5 as well. But row 2 in input has 2s, which in output, row 2 becomes a longer stretch of 2s with a 4 in the fourth position. Interesting.\n\nIn Example 1, input has rows 0 and 1 with 8s in column 1. The third row (row 3) has [0,0,0,0,2,2]. The output here is rows 0,1,2 (after input's 0,1) as [0,8,0,0,0,0], then row 3 becomes [2,4,2,2,2,2], and rows 4 and 5 are [0,8,...]. So similar pattern: the 8s from the top rows (0 and 1) in column 1 are now in rows 2,4,5 as well. The 2s in row 3 of input are expanded into a longer sequence with a 4 in the same column as the 8s (column 1 here). Wait, in Example 1's input, the 2s are in columns 4 and 5 of row 3, but in the output, row 3 becomes [2,4,2,2,2,2]. The 4 is in column 1. So the 4 is in the same column where the 8s are in the top rows. Then, the 8s from the top two rows spread downwards, but the row with 2s is transformed into a row where the same column as the 8s has a 4, and the rest are 2s. Then the 8s also appear in rows below that.\n\nSo maybe the pattern is this: For each row that has a non-zero number (other than 8?), you look at the columns where 8s are present in the upper rows, and then in the row below those 8s, you create a 4 in that column, and expand the numbers. Wait, perhaps the 8s are acting as some kind of \"source\" that affects the rows below. Let's see.\n\nIn Example 0, the 8s are in column 4 (index 4) in rows 0 and 1. Then, in the output, those 8s are present in rows 0 and 1, then row 2 (which in input has 2s) becomes a row filled with 2s except in column 4 where it's 4. Then rows 3,4,5 in output have 8s in column 4. So the 8s from the top two rows are copied down into the lower rows. But how? The row with the 2s (row 2) is transformed such that the same column as the 8s (column 4) becomes 4, and the rest of the row is filled with 2s. Then, below that row (rows 3,4,5), the 8s are present again in column 4.\n\nSimilarly, in Example 1, the 8s are in column 1 (rows 0 and 1). The row with 2s in input is row 3, which in output becomes a row with 2s except column 1 becomes 4. Then, rows 4 and 5 have 8s in column 1. So the 8s from rows 0 and 1 are propagated down, but when they reach a row that has 2s (like in input row 3), that row is modified by changing the column where the 8s are to 4, and filling the rest with 2s. Then, the 8s continue below that row.\n\nSo perhaps the rule is:\n\n1. Identify all columns where there's an 8 in any of the rows. For each such column, the 8s \"flow\" down until they hit a row with non-zero elements (like 2s). Then, in that row, the column with 8s becomes 4, and the entire row is filled with 2s (or whatever the non-zero number is, but in the examples it's 2s). Then, below that row, the 8s continue again in their column.\n\nWait, but in the first example, the 2s are in row 2. So the 8s from rows 0 and 1 in column 4. Then row 2 has 2s. So in the output, row 2's column 4 becomes 4, and the rest of the row is filled with 2s. Then, rows 3,4,5 have 8s in column 4 again.\n\nSimilarly, in example 1, the 8s are in column 1 (rows 0 and 1). Then row 3 has 2s in columns 4 and 5. So in output, row 3's column 1 becomes 4, and the rest of the row is filled with 2s. Then rows 4 and 5 have 8s in column 1.\n\nWait, but how does the 8s know which row to start affecting? It seems that the 8s in the input's upper rows (maybe contiguous?) create a vertical line of 8s in the output, except when interrupted by a row with 2s. In that case, the 8s stop, the 2s row is filled with 2s and the column where the 8 was has 4, then 8s resume below.\n\nSo steps:\n\n- For each column that has an 8 in any of the input rows:\n\n   - The 8 is copied down through all rows until a row with non-zero elements (like 2s) is encountered.\n\n   - In that row, the column's value becomes 4, and the entire row is filled with 2s (assuming the original row had 2s).\n\n   - Then, below that row, the 8s continue again in that column.\n\nBut how are the other columns filled? For example, in the first example, the third row (input row 2) had [2,2,0,0,0,0], which in output becomes [2,2,2,2,4,2]. So all the zeros in that row are filled with 2s, except the column where the 8s are (index 4) becomes 4.\n\nSimilarly, in example 1's row 3, input has [0,0,0,0,2,2]. Output becomes [2,4,2,2,2,2]. So the original 2s in columns 4 and 5 are now part of a row filled with 2s, and the column where the 8s are (index 1) becomes 4.\n\nSo the rule might be:\n\nFor any row that has non-zero elements (other than 8?), check if there's a column above it with 8s. For each such column, in that row, replace the value in that column with 4. Then, fill the rest of the row with the original non-zero value (assuming 2 in examples). Then, the 8s continue below this row.\n\nAdditionally, the 8s are propagated down from their original positions, except when interrupted by such a row. So the 8s in the output columns are present in all rows except where there's a row with 2s (or other non-8 numbers), which blocks the 8s in that column, but then resumes below.\n\nBut how do we determine which columns are affected? Let's see.\n\nIn example 0, input columns with 8s are column 4. So in the output, column 4 has 8s in rows 0,1,3,4,5. But row 2 in output for column 4 is 4. Then, rows below (3,4,5) have 8 again. So the 8s from original rows 0 and 1 are extended down, but interrupted by row 2 (which has 2s in input). Then, after that row, the 8s continue.\n\nSimilarly, example 1's 8s are in column 1. Output rows 0,1,2,4,5 have 8 in column 1. But row 3 in output has 4 in column 1, and then 8s resume in rows 4 and 5.\n\nSo for each column with 8 in any row, the 8s are extended downward until a row with non-zero (non-8) elements. Then, in that row, that column becomes 4, and the row is filled with the non-8 elements. Then, the 8s continue in the rows after that.\n\nNow, looking at the test input:\n\nTest Input:\n\n[0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0]\n[0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0]\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nSo columns with 8s in input are column 3 (index 3) in rows 0 and 1. The rows with non-zero elements (other than 8) are row 4 (2s in columns 0 and 1).\n\nSo according to the pattern, the 8s in column 3 will flow down until they hit row 4. Let's see:\n\nOriginal rows 0 and 1 have 8 in column 3.\n\nIn the output, rows 0 and 1 remain the same. Rows 2 and 3 (which are all zeros in input) would have 8 in column 3. Then, row 4 in input has 2s. So in the output, row 4's column 3 (where the 8s are) becomes 4. The rest of the row would be filled with 2s. Then, row 5 would have 8 in column 3 again.\n\nBut let's think. The 8s in column 3 from rows 0 and 1 would flow down through rows 2,3 (which are empty) so those rows would have 8 in column 3. Then, row 4 has 2s. So in output row 4, column 3 becomes 4, and the entire row is filled with 2s. Then row 5 (below row 4) would have 8 in column 3 again.\n\nBut in the test input, row 4's 2s are in columns 0 and 1. So applying the pattern, the entire row would be filled with 2s, except column 3 (from the 8s) becomes 4. So row 4 becomes [2,2,2,4,2,2]. Then, row 5 would have 8 in column 3.\n\nSo the output would look like:\n\nRow 0: same as input [0,0,0,8,0,0]\n\nRow 1: same [0,0,0,8,0,0]\n\nRow 2: [0,0,0,8,0,0] (since they were zeros and the 8s from above propagate)\n\nRow 3: same as row 2 [0,0,0,8,0,0]\n\nRow 4: [2,2,2,4,2,2] (original 2s in columns 0 and 1, but filled with 2s in all columns except column 3 which is 4)\n\nRow 5: [0,0,0,8,0,0]\n\nWait, but in the training examples, the rows after the modified row (with 4) have the 8s again. So after row 4, row 5 would have 8 in column 3.\n\nSo the output for test input should be:\n\n[0,0,0,8,0,0]\n[0,0,0,8,0,0]\n[0,0,0,8,0,0]\n[0,0,0,8,0,0]\n[2,2,2,4,2,2]\n[0,0,0,8,0,0]\n\nIs that correct?\n\nLet me check the training examples again. In example 0, the input's third row (row 2) had 2s. In output, that row becomes [2,2,2,2,4,2], and the rows below (3,4,5) have 8s in column 4. So the 8s are in the same column but resume after the modified row.\n\nIn example 1, the input's row 3 has 2s, which in output becomes [2,4,2,2,2,2], and rows 4 and 5 have 8s again.\n\nSo applying that pattern here, after row 4 (the modified row), the next rows (row 5) would have 8s in column 3.\n\nSo the test output should have rows 0-3 as [0,0,0,8,0,0], row 4 as [2,2,2,4,2,2], and row 5 as [0,0,0,8,0,0].\n\nYes, that seems to fit.",

        "cot_2": "Okay, let's tackle this puzzle. So, the task is to figure out the pattern that transforms the input matrices into the output matrices in the training examples, then apply that pattern to the test input. Let me start by carefully analyzing the training examples.\n\nLooking at Example 0:\n\nInput:\nRows with some numbers and zeros. The first two rows have 8 in the fifth position. The third row starts with two 2s. The rest are zeros.\n\nOutput:\nThe first two rows remain the same. The third row now has more 2s and a 4 and 8. Then rows 4-6 (if 0-based) have 8s in the fifth position. Wait, the output's third row is [2,2,2,2,4,2], and then the rows below repeat [0,0,0,0,8,0] except row 3 which is [0,0,0,0,8,0]. Hmm.\n\nWait, the output in Example 0's third row is [2,2,2,2,4,2], and the rows after that (rows 3 to 5) all have 8 in the fifth column. So maybe there's some kind of expansion or replication happening based on the initial numbers?\n\nIn Example 1's input, the first two rows have 8 in the second position. Then the fourth row has two 2s in the fifth and sixth positions. The output here has those 8s replicated in the third row (same position), then the fourth row becomes [2,4,2,2,2,2], and the rows below have 8s again.\n\nSo maybe the pattern is that each non-zero number in the input triggers some expansion downward or in a certain direction, combining numbers where they overlap. But how exactly?\n\nLooking at the outputs, the rows where the original numbers were in the input are retained. Then, rows below those get modified. For example, in Example 0, the third row in the input has two 2s. The output's third row now has four 2s, a 4, and another 2. Wait, how does that happen? Let me check the numbers:\n\nOriginal third row in input Example 0: [2,2,0,0,0,0]. Output third row: [2,2,2,2,4,2]. So the 2s are spread to the right, but the fourth element is 4. Wait, 2+2=4? Maybe when two 2s are adjacent, they merge into a 4. But how does this expansion occur?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the non-zero numbers in the input create a sort of \"wave\" that propagates downward, and when multiple waves meet, their values add. For example, in Example 0, the 8s in the fifth column of the first two rows might create a vertical line of 8s below them. But in the output, after the third row (original input's third row), the 8s are present in rows 3,4,5. So maybe each non-zero number in a row causes that number to be placed in the same column in the next few rows below, possibly combining with others.\n\nBut in the first example's output, the third row has 2s spreading. Let's think: the original third row has two 2s. Then, maybe those 2s are expanding to the right and down. But how? The 2s in the input third row (positions 0 and 1) become 2,2,2,2 in the output's third row. Then a 4 and 2. Wait, maybe when the 2s spread, they fill the next cells to the right. But why 4? Maybe when two 2s are adjacent, they merge. Wait, in the output third row, after the four 2s, there's a 4. The fifth element is 4. But where did that come from? In the input's third row, the fifth element is 0, but in the output's third row, the fifth is 4. Hmm. Maybe the 8s from above are interacting with the 2s.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each non-zero number in the input causes a cross shape to be created in the output. For example, in Example 0, the 8s in column 4 (fifth position) of rows 0 and 1. In the output, those 8s are present in the same rows and then rows 3-5 also have 8s in column 4. So perhaps each non-zero number creates a vertical line downward and upward, but perhaps only downward. Wait, in the input rows 0 and 1 have 8s. The output's rows 0-1 are same as input, and then rows 3-5 (indices 3,4,5) have 8s in column 4. So maybe the 8s in rows 0 and 1 propagate down, skipping row 2, and then start again from row 3. But why row 2 is skipped?\n\nBut in Example 1, the input has 8s in rows 0 and 1, column 1. The output has 8s in rows 0,1,2 and 4,5. So the 8s from rows 0 and 1 propagate down, but maybe there's a block in the third row. Wait, in Example 1's input, the fourth row (index 3) has two 2s. So the 8s from above and the 2s from below are combining in some way.\n\nAnother angle: Looking at the outputs, the non-zero rows in the input are preserved, and then new rows are generated based on some combination. For instance, in Example 0, the third row of the input (with 2s) becomes a row with more 2s and a 4, and the rows below that have 8s. Maybe it's a matter of each non-zero number in the input causing a replication in the same column for the next rows, but when multiple sources contribute to the same cell, their values are added.\n\nWait, let's take Example 0. The input has 8s in column 4 of rows 0 and 1. The output's rows 0 and 1 are the same. Then rows 3,4,5 also have 8 in column 4. So the 8s from rows 0 and 1 are causing 8s to appear three rows below (rows 3,4,5). But why three rows? Maybe the number of rows propagated is equal to the value of the number divided by 2? 8/2=4, but that doesn't match. Alternatively, perhaps the number 8 causes four rows below to have 8s. But in Example 0, the 8s in rows 0 and 1 would each generate 8s in the next four rows. But rows 0 and 1 are adjacent. Let's see: row 0's 8 would generate 8s in rows 1,2,3,4? But in the output, rows 0 and 1 remain the same, and then rows 3,4,5 have 8s. Hmm, maybe the propagation is for a certain distance.\n\nAlternatively, think of it as each non-zero cell in the input generates a vertical line downward of the same number, starting from the row below. But when another line is encountered, they merge. For example, in Example 0, the 8s in rows 0 and 1 column 4. The first 8 in row 0 would generate 8s in rows 1,2,3,4,5. But row 1 already has an 8, so maybe that's why in the output, rows 3,4,5 have 8s. Wait, but in the output, rows 0 and 1 are original, and rows 3,4,5 have 8s. So perhaps the 8s from row 0 and 1 each generate a vertical line down, but they skip the row that's already occupied by the original input. So row 0's 8 propagates down to rows 1 (but that's original), then 2,3,4,5. But original row 1's 8 would propagate down to rows 2,3,4,5. But then rows 2 would have 8s from both row 0 and 1. But in the output, row 2 is modified to have 2s and 4. So perhaps the 8s' propagation is blocked by the existing non-zero cells in row 2. So when the propagation reaches a row that has non-zero cells (from the input), it stops. So in Example 0, row 2 (input) has 2s. So the 8s from rows 0 and 1 can't propagate past row 2. Therefore, they only reach rows 3,4,5. But how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each non-zero cell in the input creates a vertical line downward, starting from the next row, until a non-zero cell is encountered. For example, in Example 0's row 0 column 4 (value 8): the next row (row 1) already has an 8 (same value), so it continues. Then row 2: but row 2 has 2s in columns 0 and 1. Since those are different columns, the 8 can continue propagating. Wait, but the 8 in column 4, row 0, would propagate down each row, same column, until it hits a non-zero in that column. In Example 0, column 4 in row 0 has 8. Then row 1 has 8 in column 4. So maybe the 8 from row 0 propagates down until it hits a non-zero in the same column. But row 1's 8 is in the same column. So the propagation from row 0's 8 would stop at row 1. Then how does the output's rows 3,4,5 have 8s? This seems conflicting.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each non-zero cell in the input causes the same number to be placed in all the rows below it in the same column. However, if another non-zero cell is present in the same column, their values are added. But looking at Example 0's output, the 8s in column 4 of rows 0 and 1. If each 8 propagates down, then rows 2,3,4,5 would have 8s in column 4. But in the output, rows 0 and 1 are the same, and rows 3,4,5 have 8s. Wait, row 2 in the output's column 4 is 4. So maybe there's a combination of the 8s from above and the 2s from the same row. Let me check:\n\nIn Example 0's output row 2, column 4 is 4. The input row 2 has no entry in column 4. But the output row 2, column 4 is 4. Where does that come from? Maybe when the 8s from above propagate down and meet the 2s in row 2. But how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the numbers are being summed along the columns. For example, in Example 0's output row 2, the 4 in column 4 could be the sum of the 8s from above (two 8s) but 8+8=16, which doesn't match. Hmm, that's not right. Then maybe it's a different approach.\n\nAnother observation: In the outputs, the original rows are present, and additional rows are added below. Wait, no. The input in Example 0 has 6 rows, and the output also has 6 rows. So perhaps the transformation is modifying the existing rows based on some rules.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each non-zero cell in the input is the center of a cross (vertical and horizontal) that fills the same number in all directions for a certain number of steps. For example, a cell with 8 would create a cross of 8s in its row and column, but limited by the cell's value. For instance, 8 might spread 4 cells in each direction (since 8 divided by 2 is 4). Let's test this.\n\nIn Example 0, the 8s in column 4 (row 0 and 1). If each 8 spreads 4 cells in all directions. But how does that work? For the 8 in row 0, column 4: spreading left 4 cells would go to column 0, but that's the start. So in the row, columns 0 to 4 would have 8s? But the output's row 0 is the same as input. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the number in the cell represents how many cells to the right and down it will spread. For example, an 8 would spread 8 cells, but that's more than the grid size. Hmm, not helpful.\n\nLooking at Example 1's output. The input has 8s in rows 0 and 1, column 1. The output has those rows plus row 2 with 8 in column 1. Then row 3 (input's row 3) has 2s in columns 4 and 5. The output's row 3 is [2,4,2,2,2,2]. So the 2s spread left and right? Maybe when there's a group of same numbers, they spread in some way. The 4 in column 1 of row 3 in Example 1's output. How does that happen?\n\nWait, in Example 1's input, the 2s are in columns 4 and 5 of row 3. The output's row 3 has 2s in columns 0,2,3,4,5 and a 4 in column 1. That 4 might be the sum of the 8s from above and the 2s from the row. But 8 + 8 + 2 + 2 = 20, but the cell is 4. Not sure.\n\nAnother angle: the output rows are created by combining the original rows with propagated values from above. For example, each non-zero cell propagates its value downward and to the sides. When two propagations meet, their values are added. Let's see.\n\nIn Example 0, the third row in the output has 2s in columns 0-3, and a 4 in column 4. The 4 could be 2 (from the original 2s) plus 8 (from the 8s above). But 2 + 8 is 10, not 4. Alternatively, maybe the numbers are multiplied. 2 * 8 is 16. Still not matching.\n\nWait, maybe each non-zero cell in the input creates a diamond-shaped pattern. For example, an 8 in row 0, column 4 would spread out in all directions for 4 steps (since 8/2=4). But how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the numbers represent the radius of their spread. An 8 would spread 8 units, but that's not possible in a 6x6 grid. So maybe it's half the value. 8/2=4, so a radius of 4. So, the cell would affect cells within 4 steps in all directions. For example, the 8 in row 0, column 4 of Example 0 would spread to rows 0-4 and columns 0-8 (but grid is only 6 columns). So columns 0-4 (since 4-4=0 to 4+4=8, but limited to 5). But this is getting complicated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the pattern is that each non-zero number in the input is mirrored both vertically and horizontally around its position, creating a cross or some symmetrical pattern. For example, an 8 in a cell creates copies of 8 in all cells in its row and column. But in Example 0, the 8s in column 4 would fill all rows in that column. But in the output, rows 0 and 1 have 8, then rows 3-5. So perhaps the mirroring skips the row where there's a different number. Like, if a row in the input has non-zero numbers, those rows block the propagation.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider that each non-zero cell in the input creates a vertical and horizontal line of the same number, but the lines stop when they hit another non-zero cell. For example, in Example 0, the 8s in column 4, rows 0 and 1. Each 8 would create a horizontal line (in their own row) and a vertical line (in their own column). But since the row 0 and 1 already have 8s in column 4, their vertical lines would continue down. However, the third row (row 2) has 2s in columns 0 and 1, which are different columns, so the vertical lines from the 8s would continue down to rows 3-5. Thus, column 4 in rows 3-5 have 8s. Then, the horizontal lines from the 8s would spread left and right, but since those rows (0 and 1) already have 8s in column 4, maybe they spread to other columns. But in the output, rows 0 and 1 are unchanged. So maybe the horizontal spread is not the case.\n\nAlternatively, the vertical lines from the 8s in column 4 would continue down, but the horizontal lines are not part of the pattern. Then, the 2s in row 2, columns 0 and 1. Each 2 would create a vertical line down and possibly a horizontal line. But their vertical lines would affect rows below. But in the output, row 3 of column 4 has 8, which is from the 8s above. The row 2's output is [2,2,2,2,4,2]. So the 2s are spreading horizontally. Maybe each 2 in the input creates a horizontal line of 2s. For example, the two 2s in row 2, columns 0 and 1 would each spread to the right, filling columns 0-3 with 2s. Then, the 4 in column 4 could be the sum of the 8s from above and the 2s. But 8 + 8 + 2 = 18, which doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps when two different numbers meet in the same cell, they are added. So in row 2, column 4, the 8s from above (two 8s) and any other contributions. But how does that sum to 4? Maybe it's not addition but some other operation.\n\nThis is getting a bit stuck. Let's try to see the structure in the outputs. For example, in Example 0's output, the third row is filled with 2s except for a 4 in the fourth position. The fourth position in that row corresponds to column 4, which is where the 8s are. So maybe the 2s from row 2 are spreading to the right, and where they overlap with the 8s' vertical propagation, the values are combined (e.g., 2 + 8 = 10, but in the output it's 4). That doesn't add up. Alternatively, perhaps when the 2s spread to the right, they create a horizontal line, and when they cross the vertical line of 8s, the value is multiplied. 2 * 8 = 16. Still not 4.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the numbers are merged by taking the average. But (2 + 8)/2 = 5. Not matching.\n\nWait, the output in Example 0's third row, column 4 is 4. Maybe that's the sum of the two 8s (from rows 0 and 1) divided by 4 (since they are two 8s, 8+8=16, 16/4=4). But why divide by 4? Not sure.\n\nAnother approach: maybe the output is built by combining the input rows with rows generated by each non-zero cell. For example, each non-zero cell creates a certain number of copies of its value in the same column in the rows below. When multiple cells affect the same position, their values are added.\n\nIn Example 0, the 8s in rows 0 and 1, column 4. Each of these would add 8 to their column in the rows below. So rows 0's 8 adds 8 to column 4 in rows 1-5. Row 1's 8 adds 8 to column 4 in rows 2-5. So rows 2-5 would have 8 (from row 0) plus 8 (from row 1) = 16. But the output's rows 3-5 have 8, not 16. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, each non-zero cell adds its value to the same column in the next 'n' rows, where 'n' is the cell's value divided by 2. For example, an 8 would affect 4 rows below. So row 0's 8 adds 8 to column 4 in rows 1-4. Row 1's 8 adds 8 to column 4 in rows 2-5. So in row 2, column 4 would have 8 (from row 0). Rows 3-4 would have 8 (from row 0 and row 1). Row 5 would have 8 from row 1. But in the output, rows 3-5 have 8, which could align with this. Then, in row 2's column 4, 8 from row 0. But in the output's row 2, column 4 is 4. So maybe the 8 from row 0 is combined with the 2s in row 2. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s in row 2 (columns 0 and 1) spread to the right, converting all zeros to 2s until they hit a non-zero. So row 2 becomes [2,2,2,2, ?, 2]. But the fifth column (column 4) is 4. So perhaps the 8 from above and the 2 from the row's spread meet here. If 8 and 2 are added, it's 10, but the output is 4. Hmm. Maybe they multiply. 8*2=16, no. Or perhaps take the minimum or maximum. Max is 8, min is 2. Not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe when two different numbers meet in a cell, their average is taken. (8 + 2)/2 =5. Not 4. Hmm.\n\nWait, in Example 1's output row 3, column 1 is 4. The input's row 3 has 2s in columns 4 and 5. So perhaps the 8s from above (rows 0-2) in column 1 are combining with the 2s from row 3. How?\n\nIn Example 1's output row 3, column 1 is 4. The 8s from rows 0-2 in column 1 would each contribute 8. But row 3's input has 2s in columns 4 and 5. So how does column 1 get a 4? Maybe it's the sum of 8s from above divided by the number of contributing cells. If three 8s (rows 0,1,2) sum to 24, divided by 6 (number of rows?), 24/6=4. That's possible. But why divide by 6?\n\nAlternatively, the 4 is the sum of two 2s. But how does that relate to the 8s in column 1.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Let's try to find a pattern that fits both examples.\n\nIn both examples, the output seems to have a central row (third row in Example 0, fourth row in Example 1) where the input's non-zero row is expanded, and the numbers are combined with others. Then, the other rows around it have the same numbers as the input's non-zero rows, but propagated.\n\nMaybe the pattern is:\n\n1. For each row in the input, if there's a non-zero number, it spreads to the entire row (left and right) with the same value, except where other non-zero numbers exist.\n\n2. Then, for each column in the input, if there's a non-zero number, it spreads downward and upward in the same column, creating a vertical line.\n\nBut in the outputs, it's more about combining the horizontal and vertical expansions.\n\nAlternatively, the transformation involves spreading each non-zero cell horizontally and vertically to fill the row and column, then combining overlapping values by addition. But in Example 0:\n\nOriginal input row 2 has [2,2,0,0,0,0]. Spreading horizontally would fill the row with 2s. So row 2 becomes [2,2,2,2,2,2]. But the output row 2 is [2,2,2,2,4,2]. The 4 in column 4 suggests that there's an addition. The 8s from column 4 of the upper rows would spread down into column 4, adding to the 2s. So 2 + 8 + 8 = 18, which is not 4. So this doesn't make sense.\n\nAlternatively, when spreading, if a cell is already filled by a horizontal spread, a vertical spread from another number would overwrite it. So in Example 0's row 2, the horizontal 2s are filled, but the vertical 8s from columns 4 would overwrite the 2s in column 4. So the row would be [2,2,2,2,8,2]. But the output is 4 there. Doesn't fit.\n\nAnother thought: The output seems to have a diamond-shaped pattern around certain cells. For example, in Example 0's output, the third row has 2s spreading out, and the 4 is in the middle. Maybe it's forming a diamond where the size is determined by the original number. But 2 would give a diamond of size 1, which is just the cell and adjacent cells. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the numbers in the output are the counts of how many times each cell is \"touched\" by the input's non-zero cells. For example, each non-zero cell in the input touches certain cells in the output, and the count is their value. But in Example 0, the 8s would touch cells in their column below, adding 8 each time. But this would lead to large numbers, which isn't the case.\n\nHmm. Let me look at the test input and see if applying a possible pattern would work.\n\nTest input:\n\n[0,0,0,8,0,0]\n[0,0,0,8,0,0]\n[0,0,0,0,0,0]\n[0,0,0,0,0,0]\n[2,2,0,0,0,0]\n[0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nThe test input has 8s in column 3 of rows 0 and 1. Then 2s in columns 0 and 1 of row 4.\n\nFollowing the pattern from the examples, the output should preserve the input rows where the non-zero cells are, and then expand below and possibly combine. In the training examples, the non-zero rows are followed by a row that's a combination of their spread. Then, below that, the vertical propagation continues.\n\nIn Example 0, the 8s are in rows 0 and 1, column 4. The output has those rows preserved, then the third row (input's row 2) has the 2s spread, and below that, the 8s continue. So perhaps the pattern is:\n\n- For each non-zero cell in the input, propagate its value downward in the same column, starting from the next row, for a number of rows equal to the value divided by 2 (8/2=4, so 4 rows). If another non-zero cell is encountered during propagation, their values are added.\n\n- Additionally, for each non-zero row (row with at least one non-zero cell), spread the values horizontally to fill the entire row with the sum of the values in that row. Wait, but in Example 0, the third row's input has two 2s, which in the output become four 2s and a 4. Maybe the horizontal spreading sums the values in the row and distributes them.\n\nAlternatively, the horizontal spread duplicates the values. But in Example 0's output row 2, the two 2s become four 2s (columns 0-3), but that's four 2s. Then, the 4 in column 4 might be from the 8s above.\n\nAnother angle: in the training examples, the output has the same number of rows as the input. The rows that have non-zero elements in the input are modified in the output by expanding horizontally. For example, the third row of input in Example 0 becomes a row filled with 2s except where other numbers are present. Then, the rows below are filled with the vertical propagation of the 8s.\n\nSo, perhaps the rule is:\n\n- For each row in the input that has non-zero elements, in the output, fill the entire row with the sum of the non-zero elements, spreading them across the row. But how?\n\nIn Example 0's row 2 input has two 2s. The sum is 4. The output row 2 has six elements. So 4 divided by 6? No, that doesn't fit. But the output row 2 has four 2s (sum 8), a 4, and a 2. Total sum 14. Which doesn't align with the input's sum of 4.\n\nThis approach doesn't seem right.\n\nAlternatively, each non-zero row in the input is expanded horizontally to fill the entire row with the same value. But in Example 0, the input row 2 has two 2s. The output row 2 has 2s in columns 0-3 and 5, and a 4 in column 4. So that's not filling the entire row. So perhaps the expansion is to the right, filling consecutive cells with the same value until another non-zero is encountered.\n\nIn input row 2 of Example 0, the first two cells are 2, then zeros. So the expansion would be to the right until the end, making [2,2,2,2,2,2]. But the output row 2 has a 4 in column 4. So maybe when the expansion meets a vertical propagation from above, they combine. The 4 could be the result of two 2s (from expansion) plus two 8s (from vertical propagation). But 2+2+8+8=20. Not 4. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, the vertical propagation from the 8s in column 4 adds 8 to the cells in column 4 of the expanded rows. So if the expansion row has 2s, then column 4 would be 2 + 8 =10. But in the output, it's 4. Not matching.\n\nThis is really tricky. Let's look for another pattern.\n\nIn both training examples, the output has a row that's a combination of horizontal and vertical elements. The key might be that each non-zero cell in the input generates a cross shape (horizontal and vertical) of the same value, and overlapping cells sum their values. For example:\n\n- An 8 in row 0, column 4 would generate a horizontal line in row 0 (columns 0-5) filled with 8s and a vertical line in column 4 (rows 0-5) filled with 8s. But then, any overlapping cells would sum.\n\nBut in Example 0's input, rows 0 and 1 have 8s in column 4. Their cross shapes would fill rows 0 and 1's columns with 8s, and columns 4 with 8s for all rows. But the output doesn't show this. The output rows 0 and 1 are unchanged, which contradicts this idea.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the cross is limited by the cell's value. For example, an 8 in a cell creates a cross extending 4 cells in each direction (since 8/2=4). But in a 6x6 grid, this would extend beyond the grid's limits. For example, the 8 in row 0, column 4 would extend up 4 rows (which isn't possible), so it extends down 4 rows. Similarly, left and right. But this might explain the patterns.\n\nIn Example 0's 8 in row 0, column 4: it would spread down 4 rows (rows 1-4) in column 4. Then, spreading horizontally, from column 4, it would spread left 4 columns (columns 0-4) and right 4 columns (columns 4-8, but limited to 5). So in row 0, columns 0-5 would be 8s. But the input row 0 already has 8 in column 4. So maybe the output's row 0 would have 8s in all columns, but in the example, it's unchanged. So this doesn't fit.\n\nBut the output for Example 0's row 0 is the same as the input, which doesn't fit the cross idea.\n\nThis is really challenging. Let's think differently. The output in both examples has a central row that seems to combine the horizontal spread of the input's non-zero row and vertical spread of other numbers. For example, in Example 0, the third row is where the 2s spread horizontally, and the 8s from above meet them. The result is a row with 2s in most columns, a 4 in the fifth column, and 2 in the last. Similarly, in Example 1, the fourth row (input's row 3) has 2s spreading horizontally, and the 8s from above meeting them, resulting in a 4 in column 1.\n\nSo perhaps the rule is:\n\n- For each row in the input that has non-zero cells, spread those values horizontally to fill the entire row, merging with any vertical propagations from above or below.\n\n- Vertical propagation: For each non-zero cell in the input, propagate its value downward in the same column for a number of rows equal to its value divided by 2. When multiple propagations meet, their values are summed.\n\n- When a horizontal spread and vertical propagation meet in the same cell, their values are summed.\n\nFor example, in Example 0's row 2:\n\nThe input has two 2s. Spreading horizontally, they fill the row with 2s. The vertical propagations from the 8s in column 4 of rows 0 and 1 would each propagate downward. Assuming 8/2=4, they would propagate 4 rows. For the 8 in row 0, column 4: propagates to rows 1-4 (4 rows). The 8 in row 1, column 4: propagates to rows 2-5 (4 rows). So in row 2, column 4, the sum would be 8 (from row 0) + 8 (from row 1) = 16. But the output has 4. So this doesn't add up.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the vertical propagation is only one row down for each unit of the value. For example, an 8 would propagate 8 rows down, but since the grid is limited, it might fill the maximum possible. But Example 0's 8 in row 0 would propagate 8 rows, which is beyond the grid. So only up to row 5. But then in row 2, column 4 would have 8 from row 0's propagation. But the output has 4. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the vertical propagation is for the value divided by 2. 8/2=4. So each 8 propagates 4 rows down. So row 0's 8 in column 4 propagates to rows 1,2,3,4. Row 1's 8 in column 4 propagates to rows 2,3,4,5. So in row 2, column 4: 8 from row 0 and 8 from row 1, sum to 16. But output has 4. Not matching.\n\nBut in Example 0's output row 2, column 4 is 4. So 16 divided by 4 is 4. Maybe the sum is divided by the number of sources. 16 /4 =4. But why 4?\n\nAlternatively, the sum of the vertical propagations is multiplied by the horizontal value. For example, the horizontal row has 2, and vertical contributions sum to 8 + 8 =16. 2 * (16/8) )=4? Not sure.\n\nThis is getting too convoluted. Let's try to find another pattern.\n\nAnother observation: in both examples, the number of rows modified in the output corresponds to the non-zero rows in the input. For example, in Example 0, the input has non-zero rows 0,1,2. The output has rows 0,1,2 modified, and rows 3-5 filled with 8s. In Example 1, input has non-zero rows 0,1,3. Output has those rows modified and others filled with 8s.\n\nWait, in Example 1's output, the rows 0-2 have 8s in column 1. Then row 3 is modified, and rows 4-5 have 8s. So perhaps the non-zero rows in the input generate vertical lines below them, and the number of lines is determined by the value.\n\nAlternatively, the non-zero rows in the input are the \"sources\", and they each generate a vertical line downward. The length of the vertical line is equal to the maximum value in the row divided by 2. For example, in Example 0's row 0 has 8, so vertical line length is 4. So from row 0, column 4, it propagates down 4 rows: rows 1-4. But row 1 already has 8, which may be another source.\n\nIn Example 0's output, the vertical lines from rows 0 and 1 in column 4 would each create 4 rows below them. So row 0's 8 would affect rows 1-4, and row 1's 8 would affect rows 2-5. So in rows 3-4, both sources contribute. But in the output, the vertical lines in column 4 appear in rows 3-5, which is three rows. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the vertical lines start from the row below the source and continue for (value / 2) rows. So an 8 would create a vertical line of 8s for 4 rows below. So in Example 0's row 0, column 4: rows 1-4. Row 1, column 4: rows 2-5. So overlapping in rows 2-4. Each of these rows would have two 8s summed. So rows 2-4 would have 16 in column 4. But the output has 4 in row 2's column 4 and 8s in rows 3-5. This doesn't match.\n\nHmm. Maybe the vertical propagation is done by adding the source value to each subsequent row's column until the end of the grid. But in Example 0, the 8s in rows 0 and 1, column 4 would add 8 to each subsequent row's column 4. So rows 2,3,4,5 would each have 8 added. But the input row 2's column 4 is 0, so output row 2's column 4 would be 8. But in the output, it's 4. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, the vertical propagation adds the value once, not accumulating. So each source adds 8 to the column in the rows below. So for example, row 0's 8 adds 8 to column 4 in rows 1-5. Row 1's 8 adds 8 to column 4 in rows 2-5. So in rows 2-5, column 4 has 8 + 8 =16. But the output has 4 and 8s. Doesn't fit.\n\nThis is really tough. Let's try to approach it from the test input. Let's imagine what the output should look like based on the examples.\n\nTest input:\n\nRow 0 and 1 have 8 in column 3.\nRow 4 has 2s in columns 0 and 1.\n\nBased on Example 0 and 1's pattern, the output would have:\n\n- Rows 0 and 1 remain the same.\n- The 2s in row 4 spread horizontally to fill their row with 2s, possibly with some modification where they meet vertical propagations from the 8s.\n- The 8s in column 3 of rows 0 and 1 would propagate downward, possibly causing 8s in rows below. But row 4 has 2s, so maybe the propagation is blocked or merged.\n\nIn Example 0's output, the third row (input's row 2) has the 2s spread and merged with the 8s. Similarly, in the test case, the 2s in row 4 would spread and maybe merge with the 8s propagating down.\n\nSo the output for the test case might look like:\n\nRow 0: same as input.\nRow 1: same as input.\nRow 2: 8s in column 3.\nRow 3: 8s in column 3.\nRow 4: [2,2,2,8's effect, ...] but perhaps merged with 8s.\nRow 5: 8s in column 3.\n\nBut how exactly?\n\nAlternatively, in the test input, the 8s in rows 0 and 1, column 3 would propagate down. Their vertical lines would pass through rows 2 and 3, then hit row 4, which has 2s in columns 0 and 1. Since the 2s are in different columns, the 8s' vertical propagation continues. So rows 2,3,4,5, column 3 would have 8s. But the output's row 4 would have the 2s spread to the right, and column 3 would have an 8. So row 4 would be [2,2,2,8, 0, 0], but according to the examples, maybe the entire row is filled with 2s except for the 8 in column 3. But in the examples, the merged value is 4. For example, in Example 0's row 2, column 4: 4. Which might be the sum of 8s from above and 2s from the row.\n\nSo in the test case's row 4, column 3: 8 (from vertical propagation) + 2 (from horizontal spread) =10. But in the examples, the merged value was 4. So this approach is not working.\n\nAlternatively, the merged value is the average. (8 + 2)/2=5, which doesn't match the examples.\n\nAlternatively, when a vertical 8 and horizontal 2 meet, it becomes 4. Maybe the product of the two numbers divided by 2: (8*2)/4=4. This matches Example 0's 4 in column 4. So if that's the case, then in the test case's row 4, column 3 would be (8*2)/4=4. Then, row 4 would have [2,2,2,4,2,2]. Then, the rows below would have 8s in column 3.\n\nSo the output for the test case would be:\n\n[0,0,0,8,0,0]\n[0,0,0,8,0,0]\n[0,0,0,8,0,0]\n[0,0,0,8,0,0]\n[2,2,2,4,2,2]\n[0,0,0,8,0,0]\n\nThis matches the pattern of the training examples. For example, the row with the 2s (row 4) is filled with 2s horizontally, and where the vertical 8s meet, it becomes 4. Then, the rows below (row 5) have the 8s again.\n\nSo applying this logic to the test input, the output should look like the above."
