        "cot_1": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. So, looking at the training examples, I need to see how the input arrays are transformed into the output. Let's start with Example 0.\n\nExample 0 Input:\n[8,6]\n[6,8]\n\nOutput is a 4x4 matrix. The output rows are:\n[8,6,6,8]\n[6,8,8,6]\n[6,8,8,6]\n[8,6,6,8]\n\nHmm. The original input has two rows. The output seems to mirror or duplicate the rows in some way. Let me see. The first row of output is the original first row followed by reversed original second row? Wait, original second row is [6,8]. Reversed would be [8,6], but the first output row is [8,6,6,8]. Wait, maybe it's the original first row concatenated with the original second row reversed. Wait, original first row is [8,6], original second row is [6,8]. Reversed would be [8,6], so concatenating gives [8,6,8,6], but the first output row is [8,6,6,8]. Hmm, that doesn't fit. Maybe there's another pattern.\n\nWait, the output rows alternate between the original rows and their reverses. Let me check. The first output row is [8,6,6,8]. If the input rows are [8,6] and [6,8], maybe the output is each row mirrored and then combined. For example, each row is duplicated and mirrored. Like, take the first row [8,6], mirror it to make [8,6,6,8], which is the first output row. Then the second row [6,8], mirror to [6,8,8,6], which is the second output row. Then the third row is the same as the second, and the fourth is the same as the first. Wait, but in the output, the third row is same as second and fourth same as first. So maybe it's creating a symmetric matrix by mirroring both rows and columns. So the output matrix is a reflection of the original array both horizontally and vertically. Like, the first and fourth rows are mirrored, and the second and third as well. So the overall matrix is a 2x2 expanded to 4x4 by mirroring each row and then mirroring the rows themselves.\n\nExample 1:\n\nInput has three rows, each of length 3. The output is a 6x6 matrix. The input rows are:\n\n[7,7,8]\n[7,7,8]\n[8,8,8]\n\nThe output rows are:\n[7,7,8,8,7,7]\n[7,7,8,8,7,7]\n[8,8,8,8,8,8]\n[8,8,8,8,8,8]\n[7,7,8,8,7,7]\n[7,7,8,8,7,7]\n\nLooking at the first output row: [7,7,8,8,7,7]. That's the original first row [7,7,8] followed by reversed [8,7,7], but reversed and then mirrored? Wait, original row is length 3, output row length 6. So maybe each element is duplicated? Like, each element is written twice. The original row is [7,7,8], so doubling each element would give [7,7,7,7,8,8], but the output is [7,7,8,8,7,7]. Wait, no. Alternatively, perhaps the original row is mirrored with some duplication. For example, take the original row [7,7,8], reverse it to get [8,7,7], then append that to the original. But [7,7,8] + [8,7,7] would be [7,7,8,8,7,7], which matches the first output row. Oh, that's possible. So each input row is transformed into a new row by concatenating the original row with its reverse. Then the output matrix is constructed by doing this for each row and then mirroring the rows in reverse order.\n\nWait, but the output has 6 rows. The original input has 3 rows. So perhaps each original row is duplicated once, then the entire list is mirrored. For example, take each input row, expand it into two rows (original and reversed?), then stack them, and then mirror the entire array. Let me see:\n\nOriginal input rows are three. The output has six rows. So for each input row, we create two output rows. For the first input row [7,7,8], the output has two rows of [7,7,8,8,7,7]. Then the third input row [8,8,8] becomes two rows of [8,8,8,8,8,8]. Then the output rows are first two rows from first input, then two from second (but in example 1, the input rows 1 and 2 are same?), wait the input for example 1 is:\n\n[7,7,8]\n[7,7,8]\n[8,8,8]\n\nSo first two input rows are same, third is different. The output's first two rows are the same as each other, then two rows from the third input, then two rows from the first again. Wait, the output rows are:\n\nRow 0: 7,7,8,8,7,7 (input row 0 concatenated with reversed)\nRow 1: same as row 0\nRow 2: 8,8,8,8,8,8 (input row 2 concatenated with reversed)\nRow 3: same as row 2\nRow 4: same as row 0\nRow 5: same as row 0\n\nHmm. So the output matrix is structured by first taking each input row, expanding them by concatenating with their reverse, then mirroring the list of rows. Let's see:\n\nOriginal input has 3 rows. Each row becomes two rows in the output (maybe same row twice?), then mirrored. Wait, for example 1's output, the first two rows are same as the expanded first input row. Then the next two are expanded third input row. Then the last two are same as the first two. So the structure is:\n\nInput rows are 0,1,2. Output rows are 0,0,2,2,0,0. Wait, but the input row 1 is same as row 0, but in the output, rows 0 and 1 are same. So perhaps each input row is duplicated in the output (so input row 0 becomes two output rows, input row 1 becomes two, etc.), and then after processing all input rows, the list of output rows is mirrored. Wait, for example 1's input has 3 rows. So each is duplicated, leading to 6 rows. But the output has 6 rows. But in example 1's output, after the first two rows, there's two rows of the third input row, then two of the first again. That suggests that after processing the input rows (each duplicated), the entire list is mirrored. So input rows 0,1,2 become output rows 0,0,1,1,2,2. Then mirroring them would give 0,0,1,1,2,2,2,2,1,1,0,0, but that's 12 rows. But the example 1's output has 6 rows. So maybe that's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is constructed by taking each input row, expand it by appending its reverse, then the entire array is mirrored vertically. Let's see for example 0.\n\nInput rows are two. Each is expanded by appending reverse, so row 0 becomes [8,6,6,8], row 1 becomes [6,8,8,6]. Then mirror the array. So original rows are row0, row1. Mirrored would be row1, row0. So the output is row0, row1, row1, row0. Then the output is:\n\nrow0: [8,6,6,8]\n\nrow1: [6,8,8,6]\n\nrow2: [6,8,8,6]\n\nrow3: [8,6,6,8]\n\nWhich matches example 0's output. So yes, the process is:\n\n1. For each input row, create a new row by concatenating the original row with its reverse (original + reversed). But wait, in example 0, the first input row is [8,6]. Reversed is [6,8]. So original + reversed is [8,6,6,8], which is the first output row. So that's correct.\n\n2. Then, for the output array, take each processed row (each input row expanded), and then mirror the entire list of rows. So if the input has N rows, the output has 2N rows. But in example 0, input has 2 rows, output has 4 rows (2N). Wait, in example 0, the input has 2 rows, output has 4. So the processed rows are row0 and row1 (each expanded to 4 elements). Then the output array is row0, row1, row1, row0. So mirrored the list of rows. So for N rows, the output has 2N rows. Wait, no. Example 0's input has 2 rows, output 4 rows. So 2N. Example 1's input has 3 rows, output has 6 rows. That fits. So the pattern is:\n\nEach input row is transformed into a new row by appending its reverse. Then, the output is the list of transformed rows followed by the reverse of the list of transformed rows. So for example, in example 0, transformed rows are [8,6,6,8] and [6,8,8,6]. Then output is those two followed by the same two in reverse order (so row1, row0). Wait, but example 0's output is:\n\nRow0: transformed row0\nRow1: transformed row1\nRow2: transformed row1\nRow3: transformed row0\n\nSo the output is transformed rows followed by the reversed list of transformed rows. Wait, the list [row0, row1] becomes [row0, row1, row1, row0]. So it's the original list followed by the reversed list. So for even N, perhaps. But example 1 has 3 input rows. So transformed rows would be 3 rows. Then output would be the 3 transformed rows followed by reversed transformed rows. So 3 +3=6 rows. Let's check example 1:\n\nTransformed rows would be:\n\nRow0: [7,7,8,8,7,7] (original [7,7,8] + reversed [8,7,7])\n\nRow1: same as row0 (since input row1 is same as row0)\n\nRow2: [8,8,8,8,8,8] (original [8,8,8] + reversed [8,8,8])\n\nThen the output rows would be row0, row1, row2, row2, row1, row0. But example 1's output is:\n\nRow0: same as row0\n\nRow1: same as row0\n\nRow2: row2\n\nRow3: row2\n\nRow4: same as row0\n\nRow5: same as row0.\n\nWait, that's not matching. Because input row0 and row1 are same, so transformed rows 0 and 1 would be same. Then the output would be:\n\nOriginal transformed rows: [row0, row0, row2]\n\nThen reversed transformed rows would be [row2, row0, row0]\n\nSo combining them gives [row0, row0, row2, row2, row0, row0], which matches example 1's output. Because the output rows are:\n\n[7,7,8,8,7,7] (row0)\n\n[7,7,8,8,7,7] (row0)\n\n[8,8,8,8,8,8] (row2)\n\n[8,8,8,8,8,8] (row2)\n\n[7,7,8,8,7,7] (row0)\n\n[7,7,8,8,7,7] (row0)\n\nWhich is exactly what example 1 shows. So the pattern is:\n\nFor each input row, create a new row by concatenating the original row with its reversed version. Then, the output array is the transformed rows followed by the reverse of the transformed rows. Wait, no. Wait, in example 0, the transformed rows are row0 and row1, and the output is row0, row1, row1, row0. So the output is transformed rows followed by transformed rows reversed. So for N input rows, the output is 2N rows: first N transformed rows, then N transformed rows in reverse order. For example, in example 0, N=2, so output is 2 transformed rows + 2 reversed transformed rows (total 4). Wait, but in example 1, N=3, output is 3 transformed rows + 3 reversed transformed rows (total 6). So yes, that fits.\n\nSo step-by-step:\n\n1. For each row in the input, create a new row by concatenating the original row with its reverse. Let's call these the transformed rows.\n\n2. Then, the output is the list of transformed rows followed by the reversed list of transformed rows. So if the transformed rows are [A, B, C], the output is [A, B, C, C, B, A].\n\nBut wait, in example 0, transformed rows are [A, B], output is [A, B, B, A]. Which is transformed rows followed by the reversed transformed rows. Similarly, in example 1, transformed rows are [A, A, C], output is [A, A, C, C, A, A]. So yes, the reversed list would be [C, A, A], but in the output, the reversed list is [C, A, A], so combined with the original [A, A, C], gives [A, A, C, C, A, A]. Wait, no. Wait, the transformed rows list is [A, B, C], reversed would be [C, B, A]. So combining gives [A, B, C, C, B, A]. But in example 1, transformed rows list is [A, A, C], reversed is [C, A, A]. So combining gives [A, A, C, C, A, A], which is what the example shows.\n\nSo the pattern is:\n\nTransformed rows are each input row concatenated with its reverse.\n\nOutput is the transformed rows followed by the reversed list of transformed rows.\n\nNow, let's check example 2 to confirm.\n\nExample 2 Input:\n\n[6,9,9]\n\n[6,4,4]\n\n[6,4,4]\n\nOutput:\n\n[6,9,9,6,6,6]\n\n[6,4,4,4,4,9]\n\n[6,4,4,4,4,9]\n\n[9,4,4,4,4,6]\n\n[9,4,4,4,4,6]\n\n[6,6,6,9,9,6]\n\nFirst, let's process each input row:\n\nRow0: [6,9,9] reversed is [9,9,6]. Concatenated gives [6,9,9,9,9,6]. Wait, but the first output row is [6,9,9,6,6,6]. Hmm, that doesn't match. So perhaps my initial assumption is wrong.\n\nWait, the first output row is [6,9,9,6,6,6]. So the original row is [6,9,9], reversed is [9,9,6]. So concatenating would be [6,9,9,9,9,6], but the output row is different. So maybe the process is different.\n\nWait, maybe instead of reversing the entire row, it's reversing each element's position. For example, for row0 [6,9,9], reverse is [9,9,6]. So concatenated would be [6,9,9,9,9,6], but the output row is [6,9,9,6,6,6]. That's not matching. So perhaps the reversal is not of the entire row, but some other pattern.\n\nLooking at example 2's output. Let's see:\n\nTransformed rows (for input rows):\n\nRow0 input: [6,9,9]\n\nTransformed row0: [6,9,9,6,6,6]\n\nHow is this formed? The original row is [6,9,9], then followed by 6,6,6. That's not the reverse of the original row. So perhaps the transformation isn't just appending the reversed row.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each element is mirrored in some way. Let's see:\n\nFor example 0's input row [8,6], reversed is [6,8], so the transformed row is [8,6,6,8]. So original row + reversed row. That works.\n\nBut for example 2's row0, [6,9,9], perhaps the reversed row is [9,9,6], and then appended. But 6,9,9 +9,9,6 would be [6,9,9,9,9,6], which is not the first output row.\n\nWait the first output row is [6,9,9,6,6,6]. So after the original row [6,9,9], the next three numbers are 6,6,6. Where does that come from? Maybe the first element is repeated three times? Because the original row is length 3, so after appending, the transformed row is length 6. So perhaps each element in the reversed row is the first element of the original row?\n\nWait, original row0 is [6,9,9]. Reversed is [9,9,6]. But in the output row0, the reversed part is [6,6,6]. That's three 6s. So 6 is the first element of the original row. So maybe the transformed row is original row followed by three copies of the first element of the original row. But in example 0, original row is [8,6]. First element is 8. So appending two 8s (since row length 2) would be [8,6,8,8]. But example 0's transformed row is [8,6,6,8]. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformed row is original row followed by the reverse of the original row, but each element in the reversed part is the first element of the original row. Wait, for example 0's row0: original [8,6], reversed would be [6,8], but in example 0's output row0, the reversed part is [6,8], so it's original + reversed. So that works, but for example 2's row0, the reversed part would be [9,9,6], but the output is [6,9,9,6,6,6]. So perhaps after the original row, instead of appending the reversed row, we append the first element of the original row repeated as many times as the row's length.\n\nOriginal row length is 3. So for row0, first element is 6, so append [6,6,6]. That would make the transformed row [6,9,9,6,6,6], which matches the first output row of example 2.\n\nWait, that seems to fit. Let's check other examples.\n\nExample 0's row0: [8,6]. Row length 2. First element 8. Appending two 8s would make [8,6,8,8], but the transformed row in example0 is [8,6,6,8]. So that doesn't fit. So this hypothesis is incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is: original row followed by the reverse of the row, but each element in the reversed part is the same as the original row's last element.\n\nExample0 row0: [8,6]. Reversed part would be [6,8], which is the reverse of the original. So that works. But example2's row0 would need reversed part to be [9,9,6], but the output's transformed row is [6,9,9,6,6,6]. So that doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. So example2's transformed rows don't follow the previous pattern, which complicates things.\n\nLet me look at example2's input and output more carefully.\n\nInput rows:\n\nRow0: [6,9,9]\n\nRow1: [6,4,4]\n\nRow2: [6,4,4]\n\nOutput rows:\n\n[6,9,9,6,6,6]\n\n[6,4,4,4,4,9]\n\n[6,4,4,4,4,9]\n\n[9,4,4,4,4,6]\n\n[9,4,4,4,4,6]\n\n[6,6,6,9,9,6]\n\nSo transformed rows would be:\n\nRow0: [6,9,9,6,6,6]\n\nRow1: [6,4,4,4,4,9]\n\nRow2: [6,4,4,4,4,9]\n\nThen the output would be these three rows followed by reversed transformed rows. So the reversed transformed rows would be row2, row1, row0. So the output should be:\n\nRow0: transformed row0\n\nRow1: transformed row1\n\nRow2: transformed row2\n\nRow3: transformed row2 reversed? Or reversed transformed rows list. Wait, according to previous examples, the output is transformed rows followed by the reversed transformed rows list. So for example2, the transformed rows list is [row0, row1, row2]. The reversed list would be [row2, row1, row0].\n\nSo output rows are:\n\nrow0: [6,9,9,6,6,6]\n\nrow1: [6,4,4,4,4,9]\n\nrow2: [6,4,4,4,4,9]\n\nrow3: [6,4,4,4,4,9] (since row2 is same as row1?)\n\nWait, no. Let me see:\n\nThe transformed rows list is:\n\nrow0: [6,9,9,6,6,6]\n\nrow1: [6,4,4,4,4,9]\n\nrow2: [6,4,4,4,4,9]\n\nSo reversed list would be row2, row1, row0.\n\nSo output rows would be row0, row1, row2, row2, row1, row0. Which is:\n\nrow0: row0\n\nrow1: row1\n\nrow2: row2\n\nrow3: row2 (same as row2)\n\nrow4: row1 (same as row1)\n\nrow5: row0 (same as row0)\n\nBut the actual output is:\n\nrow0: [6,9,9,6,6,6]\n\nrow1: [6,4,4,4,4,9]\n\nrow2: [6,4,4,4,4,9]\n\nrow3: [9,4,4,4,4,6]\n\nrow4: [9,4,4,4,4,6]\n\nrow5: [6,6,6,9,9,6]\n\nWait, the third row of the output is [9,4,4,4,4,6]. Which is not the same as any of the transformed rows. So this breaks the previous pattern. So my initial hypothesis is incorrect for example2.\n\nSo I need to rethink.\n\nAlternative approach: perhaps each output row is formed by combining the input rows in a certain way. Maybe each output row is the original row followed by the corresponding row from the mirrored input.\n\nFor example, in example0:\n\nInput rows are [8,6] and [6,8]. The output rows are:\n\nRow0: [8,6,6,8] which is input row0 + input row1 reversed?\n\nWait, input row1 is [6,8]. Reversed is [8,6]. So row0 + reversed row1 would be [8,6,8,6], but output row0 is [8,6,6,8]. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe row0 is followed by row1. But in example0, row0 is [8,6], row1 is [6,8]. So concatenated would be [8,6,6,8], which matches output row0. Then row1 concatenated with row0 would be [6,8,8,6], which is output row1. Then output rows 2 and 3 are same as row1 and row0, but that's not matching example0's output. Because output rows 2 and 3 are same as row1 and row0. Wait, no. Output rows are:\n\n[8,6,6,8]\n\n[6,8,8,6]\n\n[6,8,8,6]\n\n[8,6,6,8]\n\nWhich is row0, row1, row1, row0. So maybe the pattern is that the output rows are the concatenated pairs of each input row with the next row, and for the last row, it wraps around. But not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output matrix is a square matrix where each row is a combination of the input rows arranged in a certain way, possibly mirrored or rotated.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is a matrix formed by reflecting the input array both horizontally and vertically, and then combining them. For example, input array is N x M, and output is 2N x 2M.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each element in the output matrix is derived from the input by some transformation. For example, example0's input is 2x2, output is 4x4. Each input element is duplicated in some way.\n\nExample0 input:\n\nRow0: 8,6\n\nRow1:6,8\n\nOutput:\n\nRow0:8,6,6,8\n\nRow1:6,8,8,6\n\nRow2:6,8,8,6\n\nRow3:8,6,6,8\n\nThis looks like a mirror along both axes. So the top-left quadrant is the input, then mirrored on the right (flipped horizontally), then the bottom is a mirror of the top (flipped vertically). So for a 2x2 input:\n\nOriginal quadrant (top-left):\n\n8 6\n\n6 8\n\nTop-right: mirror of top-left horizontally:\n\n6 8\n\n8 6\n\nBottom-left: mirror of top-left vertically:\n\n6 8\n\n8 6\n\nBottom-right: mirror of top-left both ways:\n\n8 6\n\n6 8\n\nWait, that's not matching. Alternatively, the output matrix is constructed by tiling the input array and its transformations. Maybe the output is the Kronecker product or some reflection.\n\nAlternatively, let's look at example2's output. The output is 6x6. Let's see if there's a pattern in how the elements are arranged.\n\nOutput rows:\n\n0: [6,9,9,6,6,6]\n\n1: [6,4,4,4,4,9]\n\n2: [6,4,4,4,4,9]\n\n3: [9,4,4,4,4,6]\n\n4: [9,4,4,4,4,6]\n\n5: [6,6,6,9,9,6]\n\nLooking at row0: the first three elements are the original row0 [6,9,9], and the next three are 6,6,6. So perhaps the first half of each output row is the original input row, and the second half is derived from some pattern.\n\nFor row0: first half is [6,9,9], second half is [6,6,6]. So three copies of the first element of the row.\n\nRow1: first half is [6,4,4], second half is [4,4,9]. The original row1 is [6,4,4]. The second half is [4,4,9], which is the original row1 reversed but with the first element replaced by 9. Wait, original row1 reversed is [4,4,6]. But the second half is [4,4,9]. So the last element is 9. Where does that 9 come from? Perhaps it's the last element of the previous row. Or perhaps the first element of the next row.\n\nRow3: first half is [9,4,4], second half is [4,4,6]. So the second half here is [4,4,6], which is the original row1's reversed. Because row1's original is [6,4,4], reversed is [4,4,6]. But row3's second half is that.\n\nHmm. Maybe the second half of each output row is the reversed original row, but with some elements replaced.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each output row is the original row followed by the reversed row of the next row. Let's see:\n\nFor example0:\n\nRow0: original row0 [8,6] followed by reversed row1 [8,6], giving [8,6,8,6]. But output row0 is [8,6,6,8]. No.\n\nAlternatively, original row0 followed by reversed row0: [8,6,6,8], which matches row0. Then row1 followed by reversed row1: [6,8,8,6]. Then output rows 2 and 3 are same as row1 and row0, which would fit with the mirroring pattern. So example0's output rows are row0, row1, row1, row0.\n\nExample1's input rows are three. So each output row is original row followed by reversed row. Then the list of transformed rows is [row0, row1, row2], then mirrored as [row0, row1, row2, row2, row1, row0]. But in example1's input, row0 and row1 are the same. So their transformed rows would be same.\n\nBut example2's output doesn't fit this pattern.\n\nWait, looking at example2's first output row: [6,9,9,6,6,6]. The first three elements are row0 [6,9,9], the next three are [6,6,6]. If the transformed row is original row followed by three copies of the first element of the row, then for row0, it's [6,9,9,6,6,6]. For row1, [6,4,4,6,6,6], but the output row1 is [6,4,4,4,4,9]. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the second half of each output row is the reverse of the next row in the input. For example, in example0:\n\nRow0 is followed by reversed row1. Input row1 is [6,8]. Reversed is [8,6]. So row0 + reversed row1 is [8,6,8,6], but output row0 is [8,6,6,8]. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, each output row is the original row concatenated with the reverse of the same row. For example0, row0 [8,6] concatenated with reversed row0 [6,8] gives [8,6,6,8], which matches the first output row. Row1 [6,8] concatenated with reversed row1 [8,6] gives [6,8,8,6], which matches the second output row. Then, the output array is these transformed rows followed by the transformed rows in reverse order. So example0's output is row0, row1, row1, row0. Which matches.\n\nExample1's input rows:\n\nrow0: [7,7,8] \u2192 reversed is [8,7,7]. Concatenated gives [7,7,8,8,7,7].\n\nrow1: same as row0, so same transformed row.\n\nrow2: [8,8,8] \u2192 reversed is same, so transformed row is [8,8,8,8,8,8].\n\nOutput rows are transformed rows followed by reversed transformed rows list.\n\nSo transformed rows list is [A, A, C], reversed list is [C, A, A]. So the output is A, A, C, C, A, A. Which matches example1's output.\n\nExample2's input rows:\n\nrow0: [6,9,9] \u2192 reversed is [9,9,6]. Concatenated gives [6,9,9,9,9,6]. But the first output row is [6,9,9,6,6,6]. So this doesn't match.\n\nWait, this suggests that my initial hypothesis is wrong. So perhaps the transformation is different for example2.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the pattern is that each transformed row is the original row followed by the reverse of the row, but each element in the reversed part is the first element of the row.\n\nFor example0's row0: [8,6]. Reversed part would be [8,8], making [8,6,8,8]. No, but output row0 is [8,6,6,8].\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the reversed part is filled with the first element of the original row. For example0's row0 [8,6], reversed part would be [8,8], but output row0 is [8,6,6,8]. So that doesn't fit.\n\nLooking back at example2's output:\n\nRow0: [6,9,9,6,6,6]\n\nRow1: [6,4,4,4,4,9]\n\nRow2: [6,4,4,4,4,9]\n\nRow3: [9,4,4,4,4,6]\n\nRow4: [9,4,4,4,4,6]\n\nRow5: [6,6,6,9,9,6]\n\nRow3 and row4 have [9,4,4,4,4,6]. Which is different from row1 and row2. \n\nLooking at row3: first three elements are [9,4,4], which is the reverse of row2's first three elements [6,4,4] \u2192 reversed is [4,4,6]. So not matching.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps row3 is the reverse of row2's transformed row. Let's see:\n\nRow2's transformed row is [6,4,4,4,4,9]. Reversed would be [9,4,4,4,4,6]. Which is row3. Similarly, row4 is same as row3. Row5 is the reverse of row0's transformed row. Row0's transformed row is [6,9,9,6,6,6]. Reversed is [6,6,6,9,9,6], which is row5.\n\nSo example2's output is:\n\nTransformed rows: row0, row1, row2.\n\nThen reversed transformed rows: row2 reversed, row1 reversed, row0 reversed.\n\nSo row3 is row2 transformed reversed \u2192 [6,4,4,4,4,9] reversed is [9,4,4,4,4,6].\n\nRow4: same as row3.\n\nRow5: row0 transformed reversed \u2192 [6,9,9,6,6,6] reversed is [6,6,6,9,9,6].\n\nSo in this case, the output is transformed rows followed by reversed transformed rows. But each transformed row is reversed individually, not the list being reversed.\n\nSo the pattern is:\n\nFor each input row, create a transformed row by appending reversed row. Then, the output is transformed rows followed by the reversed transformed rows (each row is reversed, and the list order is preserved).\n\nSo for example0:\n\nTransformed rows:\n\nrow0: [8,6,6,8]\n\nrow1: [6,8,8,6]\n\nOutput rows:\n\nrow0 \u2192 [8,6,6,8]\n\nrow1 \u2192 [6,8,8,6]\n\nThen reversed transformed rows (each row reversed):\n\nrow0 reversed \u2192 [8,6,6,8] \u2192 same as row0.\n\nrow1 reversed \u2192 [6,8,8,6] \u2192 same as row1.\n\nBut example0's output is row0, row1, row1, row0. So this doesn't fit.\n\nHmm, this is getting complicated. Let's try to find another approach.\n\nLooking at example2's transformed rows:\n\nRow0 transformed is [6,9,9,6,6,6]. How is this formed? The original row is [6,9,9]. The appended part is [6,6,6]. So the first element of the original row, 6, repeated three times.\n\nRow1 transformed is [6,4,4,4,4,9]. The original row is [6,4,4]. The appended part is [4,4,9]. The first element of the next row (row2) is 6, but that's not part of the appended elements. Or perhaps the last element of the original row. Original row1's last element is 4. So appended part is [4,4,9]. Where 9 comes from the next row's last element. Row2's last element is 4. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, the appended part for row1 is [4,4,9]. 9 is the last element of row0. So perhaps the appended part is made from elements of other rows.\n\nThis seems inconsistent. Let's think about the entire output matrix for example2.\n\nThe output is a 6x6 matrix. The input is 3x3. Let's see how the input elements are arranged.\n\nInput:\n\nRow0: 6,9,9\n\nRow1:6,4,4\n\nRow2:6,4,4\n\nOutput:\n\nRow0:6,9,9 | 6,6,6 \u2192 the last three elements are all 6.\n\nRow1:6,4,4 | 4,4,9 \u2192 last three are 4,4,9.\n\nRow2:6,4,4 |4,4,9 \u2192 same as row1.\n\nRow3:9,4,4 |4,4,6 \u2192 last three are 4,4,6.\n\nRow4:9,4,4 |4,4,6 \u2192 same as row3.\n\nRow5:6,6,6 |9,9,6 \u2192 last three are 9,9,6.\n\nLooking at the first three elements of each output row:\n\nRows0-2: 6,9,9; 6,4,4; 6,4,4 \u2192 these are the input rows.\n\nRows3-5:9,4,4;9,4,4;6,6,6 \u2192 these are the first elements of the input rows in reverse order. For example, row3 starts with 9, which is the first element of row0's reversed part (6,9,9 \u2192 reversed part 9,9,6 \u2192 first element 9). Hmm, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the output matrix is constructed by mirroring the input matrix both vertically and horizontally. For example, the first quadrant is the input, then mirrored right, then mirrored bottom, and bottom-right is the mirrored input.\n\nBut for a 3x3 input, expanding to 6x6:\n\nOriginal input is:\n\nRow0:6,9,9\n\nRow1:6,4,4\n\nRow2:6,4,4\n\nMirrored horizontally:\n\nRow0:6,9,9 \u2192 mirrored \u2192 9,9,6\n\nRow1:6,4,4 \u2192 mirrored \u21924,4,6\n\nRow2:6,4,4 \u2192 mirrored \u21924,4,6\n\nSo the right half would be:\n\nRow0: 9,9,6\n\nRow1:4,4,6\n\nRow2:4,4,6\n\nMirrored vertically (appended below):\n\nOriginal rows:\n\n6,9,9 | 9,9,6\n\n6,4,4 |4,4,6\n\n6,4,4 |4,4,6\n\nMirrored vertically (reverse rows):\n\n6,4,4 |4,4,6\n\n6,4,4 |4,4,6\n\n6,9,9 |9,9,6\n\nThen mirrored horizontally again for the bottom-right quadrant.\n\nBut combining all this would result in a matrix like:\n\n6 9 9 9 9 6\n\n6 4 4 4 4 6\n\n6 4 4 4 4 6\n\n6 4 4 4 4 6\n\n6 4 4 4 4 6\n\n6 9 9 9 9 6\n\nWhich doesn't match example2's output. So this approach isn't working.\n\nLet's look for another pattern. Perhaps the output matrix is created by combining the input array with its transpose or some other transformation.\n\nAlternatively, looking at example2's output rows:\n\nRow0:6,9,9,6,6,6\n\nRow5:6,6,6,9,9,6 \u2192 which is the reverse of row0.\n\nRow1:6,4,4,4,4,9\n\nRow4:9,4,4,4,4,6 \u2192 reverse of row1.\n\nRow2:6,4,4,4,4,9\n\nRow3:9,4,4,4,4,6 \u2192 reverse of row2.\n\nSo the output matrix is symmetric with respect to the center row. Rows 0 and 5 are reverses of each other. Rows 1 and 4 are reverses. Rows 2 and 3 are reverses.\n\nBut how does this relate to the input?\n\nInput rows are:\n\nRow0:6,9,9\n\nRow1:6,4,4\n\nRow2:6,4,4\n\nThe output rows 0,1,2 are:\n\n6,9,9,6,6,6 \u2192 input row0 followed by 6,6,6.\n\n6,4,4,4,4,9 \u2192 input row1 followed by 4,4,9.\n\n6,4,4,4,4,9 \u2192 input row2 followed by 4,4,9.\n\nThen the next three rows are the reverses of these three.\n\nSo the pattern is:\n\nEach row in the output is either an input row followed by some suffix, or the reverse of that row.\n\nThe suffix for each input row seems to be derived from elements in other rows or some other pattern.\n\nFor example0's row0 is [8,6], and the suffix is [6,8] (reversed row0). So the transformed row is row0 + reversed row0.\n\nExample1's row0 is [7,7,8], transformed row is row0 + reversed row0.\n\nExample2's row0 is [6,9,9], reversed row0 is [9,9,6], but the suffix is [6,6,6]. So it's not the reversed row0. So this breaks the pattern.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the suffix for each row is the first element of the row repeated as many times as the row's length. For example0's row0: first element 8, repeated twice (since row length 2) \u2192 8,8. So row0 + [8,8] would be [8,6,8,8], but the transformed row is [8,6,6,8]. So this is not the case.\n\nIn example2's row0, the suffix is three 6's (first element of row0). But example0's row0 suffix is [6,8], which is not the first element repeated.\n\nThis is confusing. Let's try to find another approach.\n\nMaybe the key is to look at each element's position in the input and output matrices.\n\nFor example0:\n\nInput is 2x2.\n\nOutput is 4x4.\n\nOutput elements:\n\nRow0:8,6,6,8\n\nRow1:6,8,8,6\n\nRow2:6,8,8,6\n\nRow3:8,6,6,8\n\nThis looks like the original input is in the top-left and bottom-right quadrants, and their mirrors are in the other quadrants. Specifically, the output matrix can be divided into four quadrants:\n\nTop-left: original input.\n\nTop-right: mirrored horizontally.\n\nBottom-left: mirrored vertically.\n\nBottom-right: original input again.\n\nBut the actual values don't match this. For example, the top-right quadrant for example0 would be [6,8], but the output's top-right is [6,8], which is row0's original row reversed. Wait, maybe it's a combination of original and mirrored.\n\nAlternatively, the output matrix is the original matrix concatenated with its horizontal mirror, then vertically mirrored. So:\n\nOriginal matrix:\n\n8 6\n\n6 8\n\nHorizontal mirror (reverse each row):\n\n6 8\n\n8 6\n\nConcatenated horizontally:\n\n8 6 6 8\n\n6 8 8 6\n\nThen vertical mirror (reverse the rows and append):\n\n8 6 6 8\n\n6 8 8 6\n\n6 8 8 6\n\n8 6 6 8\n\nWhich matches example0's output. So the pattern is:\n\n1. For each row in the input, create a new row by concatenating the original row with its reverse. This gives the top half of the output.\n\n2. Then, create the bottom half by reversing the order of the rows from the top half and appending them.\n\nSo the entire output matrix is the top half (each row concatenated with its reverse) followed by the reversed top half.\n\nIn example0:\n\nTop half after step1:\n\nRow0:8 6 6 8 (original row + reversed row)\n\nRow1:6 8 8 6 (original row + reversed row)\n\nStep2: reversed top half rows \u2192 row1, row0. So bottom half is:\n\nRow0:6 8 8 6\n\nRow1:8 6 6 8\n\nSo combined, the output is:\n\nrow0:8 6 6 8\n\nrow1:6 8 8 6\n\nrow2:6 8 8 6\n\nrow3:8 6 6 8\n\nWhich matches example0.\n\nExample1:\n\nInput has three rows. Top half after step1:\n\nRow0:7 7 8 8 7 7 (original row + reversed row)\n\nRow1:7 7 8 8 7 7 (same as row0)\n\nRow2:8 8 8 8 8 8 (original row + reversed row)\n\nStep2: reversed top half rows \u2192 row2, row1, row0. So bottom half is:\n\nrow3:8 8 8 8 8 8\n\nrow4:7 7 8 8 7 7\n\nrow5:7 7 8 8 7 7\n\nCombined output is:\n\nrow0:7 7 8 8 7 7\n\nrow1:7 7 8 8 7 7\n\nrow2:8 8 8 8 8 8\n\nrow3:8 8 8 8 8 8\n\nrow4:7 7 8 8 7 7\n\nrow5:7 7 8 8 7 7\n\nWhich matches example1's output.\n\nExample2:\n\nInput rows:\n\nRow0:6 9 9\n\nRow1:6 4 4\n\nRow2:6 4 4\n\nStep1: create new rows by concatenating each row with its reverse.\n\nRow0 reversed is 9 9 6 \u2192 concatenated gives [6,9,9,9,9,6]. But example2's first output row is [6,9,9,6,6,6]. So this doesn't match. So this approach breaks for example2.\n\nAh, this suggests that example2 follows a different pattern. But wait, perhaps there's a mistake in my earlier assumption.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern for example2 is different. Let's re-express example2's input and output.\n\nExample2's input is:\n\nRow0:6,9,9\n\nRow1:6,4,4\n\nRow2:6,4,4\n\nOutput is:\n\nRow0:6,9,9,6,6,6\n\nRow1:6,4,4,4,4,9\n\nRow2:6,4,4,4,4,9\n\nRow3:9,4,4,4,4,6\n\nRow4:9,4,4,4,4,6\n\nRow5:6,6,6,9,9,6\n\nIf we follow the pattern from previous examples, the transformed rows should be the original row followed by reversed row.\n\nFor row0: [6,9,9] reversed is [9,9,6], so transformed row would be [6,9,9,9,9,6]. But example2's row0 is [6,9,9,6,6,6]. So this doesn't fit. But what's the reason for the difference here?\n\nLooking at example2's output, the first three elements of each row are the original row, and the next three are different. For row0, the next three are 6,6,6. For row1 and row2, the next three are 4,4,9. For rows3 and 4, the next three are 4,4,6. For row5, the next three are 9,9,6.\n\nThis suggests that the pattern might involve more complex relationships between rows. For example, the second half of each output row might be derived from other rows.\n\nIn row0's case, the second half is three 6s. Which is the first element of row0.\n\nIn row1 and row2's case, the second half is [4,4,9]. 4 is the second element of row1 and 9 is the last element of row0.\n\nIn rows3 and4, the second half is [4,4,6]. 4 is the second element of row1, 6 is the first element of row0.\n\nRow5's second half is [9,9,6], which is the original row0's first three elements reversed.\n\nThis is quite complicated. Perhaps the pattern is different for different examples. But that seems unlikely. The key is to find a unified pattern that explains all examples.\n\nAlternative approach: look for a pattern in how the output matrix's elements are generated from the input.\n\nFor example, in example0:\n\nInput is 2x2. Output is 4x4.\n\nThe output matrix can be viewed as:\n\n[8, 6, 6, 8]\n\n[6, 8, 8, 6]\n\n[6, 8, 8, 6]\n\n[8, 6, 6, 8]\n\nThis is a symmetric matrix where each element is mirrored both horizontally and vertically.\n\nFor example, the element at position (0,0) is 8, mirrored to (0,3), (3,0), and (3,3).\n\nSimilarly, each element is placed in four positions: original, horizontally mirrored, vertically mirrored, and both.\n\nSo for a 2x2 input, each element A[i][j] is placed at:\n\nA[i][j], A[i][M-1-j], A[N-1-i][j], A[N-1-i][M-1-j], where M and N are the original dimensions.\n\nBut for a 3x3 input, this would generate a 6x6 output. Let's check example2's output.\n\nInput is 3x3. Output is 6x6. For each element in the input, it should appear in four positions. But in example2's output, let's see.\n\nInput element row0 col0:6. In output, positions (0,0), (0,5), (5,0), (5,5).\n\nOutput row0 col0:6, row0 col5:6, row5 col0:6, row5 col5:6. So yes.\n\nInput element row0 col1:9. Output positions (0,1), (0,4), (5,1), (5,4). Let's check:\n\nrow0 col1:9\n\nrow0 col4:6 \u2192 no, not matching. Hmm, this approach may not work.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each input element is duplicated in a certain pattern.\n\nAnother observation: in example2's output, the second half of each row is a combination of elements from the same row and/or other rows. For example, row0's second half is [6,6,6], which are all the first element of row0. Row1's second half is [4,4,9], which are two 4s (from row1's elements) and a 9 (from row0). Row3's second half is [4,4,6], which are two 4s and the first element of row0.\n\nThis suggests that the second half of each transformed row is the first element of the row followed by elements from other rows. But this seems arbitrary.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the second half of each output row is the first element of the row, followed by the middle elements of the row, and ending with the last element of the previous row.\n\nFor example, row0's second half is [6,6,6], which is three copies of row0's first element. Row1's second half is [4,4,9], which is two copies of row1's middle elements (4) and row0's last element (9). Row2's second half is [4,4,9], same as row1. Row3's second half is [4,4,6], two 4s (row1's middle elements) and row0's first element. Row4's second half is same as row3. Row5's second half is [9,9,6], which is two 9s (from row0's elements) and row0's first element.\n\nThis seems inconsistent. \n\nGiven the time I've spent and the complexity, perhaps the correct pattern is:\n\n1. For each input row, create a transformed row by concatenating the original row with a reversed version of the row. However, for even-numbered examples (like example0 and example1), this holds, but for example2, there's a different pattern. But that's unlikely.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the pattern for example2 is different, but I need to find a unified pattern.\n\nLooking back at example2's transformed rows:\n\nRow0 transformed: [6,9,9,6,6,6]\n\nRow1 transformed: [6,4,4,4,4,9]\n\nRow2 transformed: [6,4,4,4,4,9]\n\nThen, the output is these three rows followed by their reversed list.\n\nReversed list of transformed rows is row2, row1, row0.\n\nBut the output rows 3-5 are:\n\nrow3: [9,4,4,4,4,6] \u2192 which is the reverse of row2 transformed. Row2 transformed is [6,4,4,4,4,9], reversed is [9,4,4,4,4,6].\n\nrow4: same as row3.\n\nrow5: [6,6,6,9,9,6] \u2192 reverse of row0 transformed. Row0 transformed is [6,9,9,6,6,6], reversed is [6,6,6,9,9,6].\n\nSo the output is:\n\ntransformed rows: row0, row1, row2.\n\nreversed transformed rows (each row reversed): row2 reversed, row1 reversed, row0 reversed.\n\nBut then why in example0 and example1, the reversed transformed rows list is the transformed rows in reverse order, but in example2, it's the reversed rows in the same order.\n\nThis inconsistency makes it difficult to find a unified pattern.\n\nBut considering that the competition requires applying the pattern to the test input, perhaps the correct approach is to look for the pattern that fits all examples.\n\nGiven that example0 and example1 fit the pattern of transformed rows being the original row concatenated with reversed row, then outputting the transformed rows followed by the reversed list of transformed rows.\n\nBut example2 doesn't fit. However, perhaps example2's transformed rows are not just the original row concatenated with reversed row but modified in some way.\n\nBut without a clear pattern, perhaps the correct way is to proceed with the initial hypothesis and see what the test input would produce.\n\nTest input:\n\n[1,4,1]\n\n[4,9,4]\n\n[9,1,9]\n\nAccording to the initial pattern:\n\nEach input row is transformed by concatenating with its reverse. Then output is transformed rows followed by reversed list of transformed rows.\n\nTransformed rows:\n\nRow0: [1,4,1] reversed is [1,4,1]. So transformed row is [1,4,1,1,4,1].\n\nRow1: [4,9,4] reversed is [4,9,4]. Transformed row [4,9,4,4,9,4].\n\nRow2: [9,1,9] reversed is [9,1,9]. Transformed row [9,1,9,9,1,9].\n\nThen the output is transformed rows followed by reversed transformed rows list.\n\nReversed transformed rows list is row2, row1, row0.\n\nSo the output rows would be:\n\nRow0: [1,4,1,1,4,1]\n\nRow1: [4,9,4,4,9,4]\n\nRow2: [9,1,9,9,1,9]\n\nRow3: [9,1,9,9,1,9]\n\nRow4: [4,9,4,4,9,4]\n\nRow5: [1,4,1,1,4,1]\n\nBut looking at the example2's output, this pattern doesn't fit. So this may not be correct. But perhaps the test input follows this pattern, and the example2 has a different pattern that's not accounted for.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct pattern is that for each input row, transformed row is original row followed by the reverse of the next row. For example, in example0:\n\nRow0: [8,6], next row is row1 [6,8]. reversed row1 is [8,6]. So transformed row0 is [8,6,8,6]. But example0's row0 transformed is [8,6,6,8]. So that's not matching.\n\nAlternatively, transformed row is original row followed by the reverse of the same row. As per example0 and example1.\n\nBut example2's transformed rows don't fit this. So perhaps there's a mistake in my analysis of example2.\n\nLet me recheck example2:\n\nInput rows:\n\nRow0: [6,9,9]\n\nRow1: [6,4,4]\n\nRow2: [6,4,4]\n\nTransformed rows according to the initial pattern would be:\n\nRow0: [6,9,9,9,9,6]\n\nRow1: [6,4,4,4,4,6]\n\nRow2: [6,4,4,4,4,6]\n\nReversed transformed rows list would be row2, row1, row0.\n\nSo the output would be:\n\nRow0:6,9,9,9,9,6\n\nRow1:6,4,4,4,4,6\n\nRow2:6,4,4,4,4,6\n\nRow3:6,4,4,4,4,6\n\nRow4:6,4,4,4,4,6\n\nRow5:6,9,9,9,9,6\n\nBut example2's actual output is different. So this suggests that the initial pattern is incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is to append the reverse of the row but with elements replaced by the first element of the row.\n\nFor example, row0 transformed: [6,9,9] + [6,6,6] (first element 6 repeated thrice).\n\nRow1 transformed: [6,4,4] + [4,4,6] (reverse of row1 is [4,4,6], but the last element is replaced with the first element of the next row (row2's first element is 6). Or perhaps the last element is the first element of the next row. For row1, next row is row2, which starts with 6. So row1's transformed row is [6,4,4,4,4,6].\n\nSimilarly, row2's transformed row would be [6,4,4] followed by the first element of the next row (which is row3, but there is none. Maybe it's the first element of the first row, 6). So [6,4,4,4,4,6]. Then the output is these transformed rows followed by reversed transformed rows list.\n\nBut example2's output rows for transformed rows are:\n\nRow0: [6,9,9,6,6,6]\n\nRow1: [6,4,4,4,4,9]\n\nRow2: [6,4,4,4,4,9]\n\nSo this doesn't match.\n\nAlternatively, the appended part is the first element of the row followed by the reversed remaining elements.\n\nFor row0: [6,9,9]. Remaining elements after first are [9,9]. Reversed is [9,9]. So appended part is 6,9,9 \u2192 [6,9,9,6,9,9]. No.\n\nAlternatively, appended part is the first element of the row followed by the reverse of the rest.\n\nRow0: rest after first is [9,9], reversed is [9,9]. So appended part is [6,9,9]. Transformed row is [6,9,9,6,9,9]. Doesn't match.\n\nAlternatively, appended part is the reverse of the rest of the row. For row0, rest after first element is [9,9], reversed is [9,9]. So appended part is [9,9]. Transformed row is [6,9,9,9,9]. But row0's transformed row is length 6, so perhaps the appended part is the reverse of the entire row, then take the first element. This is getting too vague.\n\nAt this point, given time constraints, I'll proceed with the initial pattern that works for examples 0 and 1, even though example2 doesn't fit. Perhaps there's a mistake in example2's analysis, or perhaps it's a different pattern. But given the test input, I'll proceed.\n\nTest input:\n\n[1,4,1]\n\n[4,9,4]\n\n[9,1,9]\n\nTransformed rows:\n\nEach row is concatenated with its reverse.\n\nRow0: [1,4,1] + [1,4,1] \u2192 [1,4,1,1,4,1]\n\nRow1: [4,9,4] + [4,9,4] \u2192 [4,9,4,4,9,4]\n\nRow2: [9,1,9] + [9,1,9] \u2192 [9,1,9,9,1,9]\n\nReversed transformed rows list is row2, row1, row0.\n\nSo output rows:\n\nRow0: [1,4,1,1,4,1]\n\nRow1: [4,9,4,4,9,4]\n\nRow2: [9,1,9,9,1,9]\n\nRow3: [9,1,9,9,1,9]\n\nRow4: [4,9,4,4,9,4]\n\nRow5: [1,4,1,1,4,1]\n\nBut looking at example2's output, this pattern doesn't fit, so perhaps the correct answer is different. However, given the time I've spent and the need to provide an answer, I'll proceed with this pattern.",

        "cot_2": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. So, looking at the training examples, I need to see how the input arrays are transformed into the output arrays. Let's start with Example 0.\n\nIn Example 0, the input is two rows: [8,6] and [6,8]. The output has four rows. The first output row is [8,6,6,8], which looks like the first input row followed by the second input row reversed. The second output row is [6,8,8,6], which is the second input row followed by the first reversed. Then the third row is the same as the second, and the fourth is the same as the first. Wait, no, the output shows the first row as [8,6,6,8], then the second and third rows are both [6,8,8,6], and the fourth is [8,6,6,8]. Hmm, so maybe the output is a square matrix where each row is formed by combining the original row and its reverse or another row's reverse. But let's check another example to confirm.\n\nLooking at Example 1. The input has three rows, each of length 3. The output has six rows. The output rows are two copies of [7,7,8,8,7,7], then two copies of [8,8,8,8,8,8], then again two copies of the first two rows. So, for each input row, perhaps they're being mirrored and then duplicated. Wait, the input row [7,7,8] when mirrored would become 8,7,7. So combining original and mirror gives [7,7,8,8,7,7], which matches the first output row. Similarly, the third input row is [8,8,8], mirroring it would be the same, so combining gives [8,8,8,8,8,8]. Then each of these combined rows is repeated twice. So the output is double the size in both dimensions. The original input is 3x3, output is 6x6. Each original element is transformed into a 2x2 block. So for each input element, maybe we create a 2x2 block where the original is paired with its mirror, and then arranged in some way.\n\nWait, but Example 0's input is 2x2, output is 4x4. So the output size is double the input size in both dimensions. So for each input row, we generate two output rows, and each element in the input is expanded into two elements. Let's see Example 2.\n\nExample 2 input is 3x3. Output is 6x6. So same as the others, output size is double input size. The input rows are [6,9,9], [6,4,4], [6,4,4]. The output rows are:\n\n[6,9,9,6,6,6]\n[6,4,4,4,4,9]\n[6,4,4,4,4,9]\n[9,4,4,4,4,6]\n[9,4,4,4,4,6]\n[6,6,6,9,9,6]\n\nHmm, this is more complex. Let's look at the first output row: 6,9,9,6,6,6. The original first input row is [6,9,9]. The mirror of that would be [9,9,6]. So combining the original and mirror gives [6,9,9,9,9,6], but that's not the case here. Instead, the first output row is [6,9,9,6,6,6]. Wait, perhaps the original row is combined with another row's reversed. Looking at the output rows for Example 2, the first row ends with 6,6,6. Maybe each input row is combined with another row's reversed, and there's some pattern of which rows are paired.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each input element is being duplicated in some way. For example, in the first example's first output row [7,7,8,8,7,7], each element from the input row [7,7,8] is mirrored. So 7,7,8 becomes 7,7,8 followed by 8,7,7. Wait, combining those would make a row of length 6: 7,7,8,8,7,7. Yes, that's exactly the first output row. Then the same for the second input row [7,7,8], so same result. The third input row [8,8,8] mirrors to itself, so combined becomes [8,8,8,8,8,8]. So each input row is concatenated with its reverse, then the entire output array is formed by taking each input row's concatenated version and duplicating it if needed.\n\nBut looking at the output of Example 0: input is two rows. The first output row is [8,6,6,8], which is the first input row [8,6] followed by the second input row reversed [8,6]. Wait, the second input row is [6,8], reversed is [8,6]. So first output row is [8,6] + [8,6] reversed? Wait, [6,8] reversed is [8,6], so [8,6] + [8,6] gives [8,6,8,6], but the output is [8,6,6,8]. Hmm, that's not matching. Wait, maybe each row is mirrored and then combined with another row. Let me check again.\n\nIn Example 0, input is:\n\nRow 0: [8,6]\n\nRow 1: [6,8]\n\nOutput rows:\n\n[8,6,6,8]\n\n[6,8,8,6]\n\n[6,8,8,6]\n\n[8,6,6,8]\n\nSo each output row is the original row concatenated with the reversed of the same row. Wait, original row [8,6] reversed is [6,8]. So concatenated would be [8,6,6,8], which is the first output row. Then the second row of input is [6,8], reversed is [8,6], so concatenated is [6,8,8,6], which matches the second output row. Then the third row is the same as the second, and the fourth is the same as the first. Wait, but the output has four rows. The input has two rows, output has four rows. So each input row is processed into two output rows. So maybe each input row is duplicated, but when you process the input, you mirror each row and then arrange them in a way that the output has double the rows.\n\nWait, but in Example 0, input is 2 rows, output is 4 rows. So for each input row, two output rows. Let's see:\n\nRow 0: [8,6] \u2192 [8,6,6,8] (row 0 concatenated with reversed row 0)\n\nRow 1: [6,8] \u2192 [6,8,8,6] (row 1 concatenated with reversed row 1)\n\nThen in the output, these two rows are each duplicated. So the output is:\n\n[8,6,6,8]\n\n[6,8,8,6]\n\n[6,8,8,6]\n\n[8,6,6,8]\n\nWait, but that's two original rows, each duplicated once. So the output is the original transformed row, followed by the transformed row of the next row, then reversed? Not sure. Alternatively, maybe the output is a mirror of the transformed rows. Like first row is the transformed row 0, then transformed row 1, then transformed row 1 again, then transformed row 0 again. So it's like building a symmetric structure.\n\nIn Example 1, the output is:\n\nFirst two rows are the transformed row 0 of the input (which is [7,7,8] \u2192 [7,7,8,8,7,7]).\n\nThen next two rows are transformed row 2 (since input row 2 is [8,8,8], transformed to [8,8,8,8,8,8]).\n\nThen the last two rows are again transformed row 0. Wait, but input has three rows, and output has six rows. So each input row's transformed version is duplicated once, but arranged in a certain order. Wait, input rows are:\n\nRow 0: [7,7,8]\n\nRow 1: [7,7,8]\n\nRow 2: [8,8,8]\n\nTransforming each row by concatenating with reverse:\n\nRow 0 \u2192 [7,7,8,8,7,7]\n\nRow 1 \u2192 same as row 0.\n\nRow 2 \u2192 [8,8,8,8,8,8]\n\nSo the output has two copies of row 0's transformation, two copies of row 2's transformation, and then again two copies of row 0's transformation. Hmm, but that's 6 rows. So the order is row0, row0, row2, row2, row0, row0. That seems a bit strange. Alternatively, perhaps the output is arranged such that it's a mirror of the transformed input rows. For example, the first three transformed rows followed by the reverse of them. But with three input rows, transformed into three rows, then mirrored, but that would make six. But in Example 1, the output has six rows arranged as [0,0,2,2,0,0], which doesn't fit that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is built by mirroring the entire input array vertically. For instance, in Example 0, the input is two rows. The output is the transformed rows followed by their reversed order. So transformed rows [0,1], then [1,0], making four rows. Which is what we see in Example 0's output: 0,1,1,0.\n\nSimilarly, in Example 1, the input has three rows. Transformed rows would be 0,1,2. Then mirrored as 2,1,0. But combining them would give six rows: 0,1,2,2,1,0. But in Example 1's output, the rows are 0,0,2,2,0,0. Hmm, that doesn't fit. So maybe there's a different pattern.\n\nLooking at Example 2's output, the input is three rows. The output is six rows. Let's list them:\n\nRow 0: [6,9,9,6,6,6] \u2192 transformed row0?\n\nRow 1: [6,4,4,4,4,9] \u2192 transformed row1?\n\nRow 2: [6,4,4,4,4,9] \u2192 same as row1\n\nRow 3: [9,4,4,4,4,6]\n\nRow 4: [9,4,4,4,4,6]\n\nRow 5: [6,6,6,9,9,6]\n\nLooking at input row0: [6,9,9]. Transforming it by concatenating with reversed gives [6,9,9,9,9,6], but output row0 is [6,9,9,6,6,6]. That's different. So maybe each transformed row is not just the original plus reversed. Maybe there's a different transformation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each element in the input array is being transformed into a 2x2 block. For example, each element x is replaced by x and another value. Let's think of Example 0. Input is 2x2. Output is 4x4. So each element becomes a 2x2 block. Let's see:\n\nOriginal input:\n\nRow0: [8,6]\n\nRow1: [6,8]\n\nThe output rows are:\n\nRow0: 8,6,6,8 \u2192 which is 8 followed by 6, then 6 followed by 8.\n\nRow1:6,8,8,6 \u2192 6,8 then 8,6.\n\nRow2: same as row1.\n\nRow3: same as row0.\n\nSo maybe each original element is placed in a 2x2 block in the output. For example, element 8 becomes a block [8,6;6,8], but that's not exactly matching. Alternatively, perhaps the output is created by mirroring the entire matrix both horizontally and vertically. For example, in Example 0, the input is:\n\n8 6\n\n6 8\n\nMirroring horizontally would give:\n\n6 8\n\n8 6\n\nThen combining vertically:\n\nOriginal and mirrored horizontally, then mirrored vertically. But not sure.\n\nAnother approach: looking at the output matrices, they seem to form a pattern where each quadrant is a mirror of the original. For Example 0, the output can be divided into four quadrants:\n\nTop-left: [8,6], same as input row0.\n\nTop-right: [6,8], same as input row1.\n\nBottom-left: [6,8], same as input row1.\n\nBottom-right: [8,6], same as input row0.\n\nWait, that makes sense. So the output is a 4x4 matrix formed by arranging the original 2x2 matrix and its mirrors. So:\n\nOriginal matrix is:\n\nA B\n\nC D\n\nThen the output would be:\n\nA B B A\n\nC D D C\n\nC D D C\n\nA B B A\n\nWait, but Example 0's input is:\n\nA=8, B=6\n\nC=6, D=8\n\nSo output would be:\n\nA B B A \u2192 8 6 6 8 (matches first row)\n\nC D D C \u21926 8 8 6 (second row)\n\nThen again C D D C (third row)\n\nAnd A B B A (fourth row). Which matches exactly the output of Example 0. So the pattern here is that each element is mirrored both horizontally and vertically, creating a larger matrix where the original is in the top-left, mirrored horizontally in the top-right, mirrored vertically in the bottom-left, and mirrored both ways in the bottom-right. But the arrangement is such that the output matrix is formed by tiling the original and its mirrors in a symmetric way.\n\nSo for an input matrix of size N x M, the output is 2N x 2M. Each element (i,j) in the input is replicated into four positions in the output: (i,j), (i, 2M-j-1), (2N-i-1, j), and (2N-i-1, 2M-j-1). So the entire input is mirrored both horizontally and vertically.\n\nWait, let's test this with Example 1. Input is 3x3. Output is 6x6. Let's see:\n\nOriginal input:\n\nRow0:7 7 8\n\nRow1:7 7 8\n\nRow2:8 8 8\n\nMirroring horizontally would flip each row, so row0 becomes 8 7 7. Then the output matrix would be:\n\nOriginal rows followed by their horizontal mirrors, and then vertically mirrored.\n\nBut according to the pattern from Example 0, the output should be a 2x2 expansion of each element. But let's see the output of Example1.\n\nThe first two output rows are [7,7,8,8,7,7], which is the original row0 followed by its horizontal mirror. Then rows 3 and 4 are [8,8,8,8,8,8], which is the original row2 followed by its mirror (which is same as original). Then rows 5 and 6 are again the first two rows. Wait, but the output is six rows. So maybe for each row in the input, we create two rows in the output: the original row concatenated with its horizontal mirror, and then the vertical mirror of that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is constructed by taking each row, appending its reverse, and then appending the reverse of the entire array. Let's see.\n\nIn Example0, the input is:\n\nRow0:8,6\n\nRow1:6,8\n\nThe output rows are:\n\nRow0:8,6,6,8 \u2192 row0 + reversed(row0) \u2192 8,6 + 6,8\n\nRow1:6,8,8,6 \u2192 row1 + reversed(row1) \u21926,8 +8,6\n\nThen the next two rows are row1's transformed version again, then row0's transformed again. So perhaps the output is the transformed rows followed by the transformed rows in reverse order.\n\nSo for two input rows, the output is:\n\ntransformed_row0\n\ntransformed_row1\n\ntransformed_row1 (again)\n\ntransformed_row0 (again)\n\nWhich gives four rows, as in Example0.\n\nFor Example1, which has three input rows, the output would be:\n\ntransformed_row0\n\ntransformed_row0 (since input row0 and row1 are same)\n\ntransformed_row2\n\ntransformed_row2\n\ntransformed_row0\n\ntransformed_row0\n\nBut the output of Example1 has:\n\n[7,7,8,8,7,7]\n\n[7,7,8,8,7,7]\n\n[8,8,8,8,8,8]\n\n[8,8,8,8,8,8]\n\n[7,7,8,8,7,7]\n\n[7,7,8,8,7,7]\n\nWhich matches this pattern. Since input row0 and row1 are same, their transformed versions are same. Then row2's transformed version is duplicated twice, and then row0's again. So the order is transformed rows of the input in order, each duplicated, then reversed order of the transformed rows again. Wait, but three input rows would become six output rows. Let's see:\n\nOriginal transformed rows: row0, row1 (same as row0), row2.\n\nEach is duplicated once. So output is row0, row0, row2, row2, row0, row0. Which matches Example1's output.\n\nSo the pattern seems to be:\n\nFor each row in the input, generate a transformed row by concatenating the original row with its reverse (horizontally mirrored). Then, the output is constructed by taking each transformed row and duplicating it (so each input row becomes two identical rows in the output), and then appending the same sequence in reverse order. Wait, but in Example0, after duplicating each transformed row, the output is [t_row0, t_row1, t_row1, t_row0], which is t_row0, t_row1 followed by their reverses.\n\nWait, perhaps the output is created by first taking each transformed row twice (duplicated) and then mirroring the entire list of transformed rows. For example:\n\nOriginal transformed rows: [t0, t1]\n\nThen duplicated: [t0, t0, t1, t1]\n\nBut that's not matching Example0. Alternatively, for Example0's input of two rows, the transformed rows are t0 and t1. Then the output is t0, t1, t1, t0. Which is the transformed rows followed by their reverse. So for N input rows, the output has 2N rows: first N transformed rows, then N transformed rows in reverse order.\n\nBut in Example0, input has 2 rows, output has 4 rows. So 2N rows. Applying this, the first two rows would be t0 and t1, then reversed t1 and t0. But Example0's output is t0, t1, t1, t0. Which is exactly the transformed rows followed by their reverse. So yes, for N input rows, output has 2N rows, formed by appending the transformed rows and their reversed list.\n\nBut in Example1, input has 3 rows. Output has 6 rows. Transformed rows are t0, t1, t2. Then reversed list is t2, t1, t0. So output would be t0, t1, t2, t2, t1, t0. But the actual output is t0, t0, t2, t2, t0, t0. So this contradicts.\n\nWait, in Example1, input rows are:\n\nRow0: [7,7,8]\n\nRow1: [7,7,8]\n\nRow2: [8,8,8]\n\nSo transformed rows would be:\n\nt0: [7,7,8,8,7,7]\n\nt1: same as t0\n\nt2: [8,8,8,8,8,8]\n\nIf the output is the transformed rows followed by their reversed order, then:\n\nOriginal order: t0, t1, t2 \u2192 but t1 is same as t0.\n\nReversed order: t2, t1, t0 \u2192 which would be t2, t0, t0.\n\nBut the output is:\n\nt0, t0, t2, t2, t0, t0.\n\nHmm. So perhaps the rule is different. Let's think again. Maybe each transformed row is duplicated once, and then the entire list is mirrored.\n\nSo for Example0:\n\nTransformed rows are t0 and t1. Each duplicated once gives t0, t0, t1, t1. Then mirroring gives t0, t0, t1, t1, t1, t1, t0, t0. But the output has four rows. That doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, for each input row, generate two copies of the transformed row. Then, the output is those rows followed by the same rows in reverse order. For example, in Example0:\n\nTwo transformed rows (each duplicated once) \u2192 t0, t1. Then mirror \u2192 t1, t0. So output is t0, t1, t1, t0. But that's four rows. Which matches.\n\nIn Example1:\n\nThree transformed rows: t0, t0, t2. Each duplicated once (so two copies each?), then mirrored. Wait, perhaps for each input row, the transformed row is duplicated once (so two copies), leading to 3*2=6 rows. Then mirroring the entire list. But input has 3 rows. So transformed rows duplicated would be t0, t0, t0, t0, t2, t2? No, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the pattern could be that each transformed row is duplicated in the output the same number of times as the original row's occurrence. For Example1, rows 0 and 1 are same, so their transformed versions are duplicated twice each. Row2 is unique and duplicated twice. But in the output, we have t0 twice, t2 twice, then t0 twice again. That might be the case if the output is arranged as the transformed rows followed by their reverse, but with duplication. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is built by doubling each row vertically and horizontally. For example, each element in the input is replaced by a 2x2 block where the elements are arranged in a certain way.\n\nLooking at Example0's input:\n\n8 6\n\n6 8\n\nEach element is replaced by a 2x2 block. For example, 8 becomes [8,6;6,8], but I'm not sure. Let's see the output:\n\nRow0:8,6,6,8 \u2192 which could be the original row followed by its reverse.\n\nRow1:6,8,8,6 \u2192 original row reversed.\n\nThen rows 2 and 3 are the same as rows1 and 0 again. So perhaps each row is duplicated and mirrored, and the entire matrix is mirrored.\n\nAlternatively, considering the output as the original matrix concatenated with its reverse along the rows and then along the columns. But it's getting a bit complicated.\n\nMaybe the key is to look for each input row to be transformed into a row in the output that is the original row followed by its reverse. Then, the output rows are formed by taking each transformed row and duplicating it, then appending the reversed list of transformed rows.\n\nBut in Example0, transformed rows are t0 and t1. Output is t0, t1, t1, t0. Which is transformed rows followed by their reverse.\n\nExample1's input rows are t0, t0, t2. So transformed rows list is [t0, t0, t2]. Reversed list is [t2, t0, t0]. So the output would be t0, t0, t2, t2, t0, t0. Which matches Example1's output.\n\nYes! So the pattern is:\n\n1. For each row in the input, create a new row by concatenating the original row with its reverse (horizontally mirrored).\n\n2. Take the list of these transformed rows and append the reversed list of these transformed rows. So the output is [transformed_rows] + [reversed(transformed_rows)].\n\nBut wait, in Example0, transformed_rows are [t0, t1]. Reversed list is [t1, t0]. So the output is t0, t1, t1, t0. Which matches.\n\nIn Example1, transformed_rows are [t0, t0, t2]. Reversed list is [t2, t0, t0]. So output is t0, t0, t2, t2, t0, t0. Which matches.\n\nExample2's input is three rows. Let's see:\n\nInput rows:\n\nRow0: [6,9,9]\n\nRow1: [6,4,4]\n\nRow2: [6,4,4]\n\nTransformed rows would be:\n\nt0: [6,9,9,9,9,6] (original row + reversed row [9,9,6]) \u2192 wait, original row [6,9,9], reversed is [9,9,6], so concatenated would be [6,9,9,9,9,6]. But the first output row in Example2 is [6,9,9,6,6,6]. That doesn't match. So perhaps my previous assumption is incorrect.\n\nWait, maybe the transformation for each row is not simply original + reversed. Let's look at Example2's output rows.\n\nOutput row0: [6,9,9,6,6,6]\n\nOriginal row0 is [6,9,9]. If we reverse it, it's [9,9,6]. Concatenated would be [6,9,9,9,9,6], but output row0 is different. So my previous hypothesis is invalid.\n\nHmm, this complicates things. Let's re-examine Example2.\n\nInput rows:\n\nRow0:6,9,9\n\nRow1:6,4,4\n\nRow2:6,4,4\n\nOutput rows:\n\n0: [6,9,9,6,6,6]\n\n1: [6,4,4,4,4,9]\n\n2: [6,4,4,4,4,9]\n\n3: [9,4,4,4,4,6]\n\n4: [9,4,4,4,4,6]\n\n5: [6,6,6,9,9,6]\n\nWait, so row0 of the output is [6,9,9,6,6,6]. So the first three elements are the original row0, and the last three are [6,6,6]. Where does that come from?\n\nRow5 of the output is [6,6,6,9,9,6]. Which starts with three 6s, then 9,9,6. So maybe this is a reversed version of row0's transformed row.\n\nLooking at row0's transformed row (output row0) and row5, they are each other's reverses. For example:\n\nRow0:6,9,9,6,6,6 \u2192 reversed is 6,6,6,9,9,6 \u2192 which is row5.\n\nSimilarly, row1 of output is [6,4,4,4,4,9], reversed is [9,4,4,4,4,6], which is row3.\n\nRow2 is same as row1, reversed as row3. Row3 is same as row4. Row5 is reversed row0.\n\nSo the output is constructed by:\n\nFor each transformed row (appended with some pattern), then followed by the reverse of those rows.\n\nSo the output is:\n\n[transformed_row0, transformed_row1, transformed_row2, reversed(transformed_row2), reversed(transformed_row1), reversed(transformed_row0)]\n\nBut in Example2's case, there are three input rows, so the output would be six rows.\n\nBut let's check:\n\ntransformed_row0: [6,9,9,6,6,6]\n\ntransformed_row1: [6,4,4,4,4,9]\n\ntransformed_row2: [6,4,4,4,4,9] (since row2 is same as row1)\n\nThen reversed order of transformed rows would be [transformed_row2, transformed_row1, transformed_row0]. Reversed each row would be [9,4,4,4,4,6], [9,4,4,4,4,6], [6,6,6,9,9,6].\n\nSo the output would be:\n\ntransformed_row0 \u2192 row0\n\ntransformed_row1 \u2192 row1\n\ntransformed_row2 \u2192 row2\n\nreversed(transformed_row2) \u2192 row3\n\nreversed(transformed_row1) \u2192 row4\n\nreversed(transformed_row0) \u2192 row5\n\nWhich matches the output of Example2. So the pattern is:\n\n- For each row in the input, create a transformed row (how? That's still unclear).\n\n- The output is the list of transformed rows followed by the list of reversed transformed rows in reverse order.\n\nBut the key is to determine how each input row is transformed into the output row.\n\nLooking at Example0's first input row [8,6], transformed to [8,6,6,8]. Which is original row followed by reversed row. But in Example2's row0: input [6,9,9] becomes [6,9,9,6,6,6]. So the transformed row is not original + reversed. So the transformation rule must be different.\n\nLet's look at the transformed rows:\n\nExample0:\n\nInput row0: [8,6] \u2192 output row0: [8,6,6,8]\n\nWhich is original + reversed.\n\nExample1:\n\nInput row0: [7,7,8] \u2192 output row0: [7,7,8,8,7,7]\n\nOriginal + reversed.\n\nExample2:\n\nInput row0: [6,9,9] \u2192 output row0: [6,9,9,6,6,6]\n\nOriginal + [6,6,6], which is not reversed. Because reversed row0 is [9,9,6]. So why is the transformed row [6,9,9,6,6,6]?\n\nThis is conflicting. So perhaps the transformation isn't the same across examples. So I need to find another pattern.\n\nLooking at the output row0 in Example2: [6,9,9,6,6,6].\n\nThe first three elements are the original row0. The next three are 6,6,6. The last element of the original row0 is 9. So maybe the transformed row is original row followed by three copies of the first element of the original row. No, but original row0 starts with 6, then three 6s.\n\nBut that doesn't fit other examples. Example0's transformed row0 ends with 6,8. The first element is 8. So maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, the transformed row is the original row followed by the first element of the row repeated as many times as needed to make the length double. For Example0's row0: length 2, so append first two elements reversed. Not sure.\n\nAnother approach: for each input row, the transformed row is created by concatenating the original row with the reverse of the row below it. But in Example0, row0's transformed is row0 + reverse of row1. Row1 is [6,8], reversed is [8,6]. So row0's transformed would be [8,6,8,6], but the output is [8,6,6,8]. That doesn't match.\n\nAlternatively, transformed row is original row + reversed row of the same row. But in Example2's row0, reversed row is [9,9,6], so concatenated would be [6,9,9,9,9,6], which doesn't match the output. So that's not it.\n\nLooking at Example2's output row0: [6,9,9,6,6,6]. The first three elements are the original row0. The next three are 6,6,6. The first element of row0 is 6. Maybe the transformed row is original row followed by three copies of the first element. But in Example0, the first element is 8. So transformed row would be [8,6,8,8], but output row0 is [8,6,6,8]. No.\n\nAlternatively, the transformed row is the original row followed by the first element of the row, then the last element of the row, then the first again. For Example0's row0: [8,6] \u2192 append first (8), last (6), first (8) \u2192 [8,6,8,6,8], but no. Not matching.\n\nLooking at Example2's output row0 again. The first three are [6,9,9], the original. The next three are [6,6,6]. So perhaps the transformed row is original row followed by the first element of the row repeated three times. Original row0's first element is 6, so three 6s. That fits. Let's check other examples.\n\nExample0's row0: [8,6]. Transformed row is [8,6,6,8]. The first element is 8. If we append two elements (since original length is 2, need to double). So 8,6 followed by 6,8. Which is the original row followed by reversed row. So that fits.\n\nExample1's row0: [7,7,8]. Transformed row is [7,7,8,8,7,7]. Original followed by reversed row. Which fits.\n\nBut Example2's row0 transformed is original row [6,9,9] followed by [6,6,6]. So not reversed. So there's inconsistency.\n\nBut wait, perhaps the transformation is different for even and odd length rows?\n\nExample0's row0 has length 2 (even). So transformed is original + reversed.\n\nExample1's row0 has length 3 (odd). Transformed is original + reversed (but reversed of a 3-element row is [8,7,7], so concatenated would be [7,7,8,8,7,7], which matches.\n\nExample2's row0 is length 3. So why is transformed row [6,9,9,6,6,6] instead of [6,9,9,9,9,6]?\n\nAh, this is a problem. So in Example2's row0, the transformed row is not original + reversed. So my initial hypothesis is incorrect.\n\nAlternative approach: let's look for other patterns in the transformed rows.\n\nExample2's row0 transformed: [6,9,9,6,6,6]\n\nLooking at the input, the row below row0 is row1: [6,4,4]. Maybe the transformed row is combining row0 and row1's elements in some way. The last three elements of transformed row0 are 6,6,6. The first element of row1 is 6. So perhaps the last three elements are three copies of the first element of row1.\n\nSimilarly, transformed row1: [6,4,4,4,4,9]. Original row1 is [6,4,4]. The last three elements are 4,4,9. The first element of row2 is 6. But 4 is not 6. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, the last three elements are the first three elements of the next row. But row1's next row is row2: [6,4,4]. First three elements are 6,4,4. So transformed row1's last three elements are 4,4,9. Which doesn't match.\n\nAlternatively, the transformed row's last three elements are the reverse of the next row. For row0, next row is row1: [6,4,4]. Reversed is [4,4,6]. But transformed row0's last three are 6,6,6. Doesn't match.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Let's try to find another angle.\n\nLooking at the output of Example2:\n\nRow0:6,9,9,6,6,6\n\nRow1:6,4,4,4,4,9\n\nRow2:6,4,4,4,4,9\n\nRow3:9,4,4,4,4,6\n\nRow4:9,4,4,4,4,6\n\nRow5:6,6,6,9,9,6\n\nNoticing that rows 0 and 5 are mirrors of each other. Rows1 and3 are mirrors. Rows2 and4 are mirrors. So the output is symmetric, with rows 0 and5, 1 and3, 2 and4 being mirrors. This suggests that the output is formed by appending the transformed rows and then their mirrored versions.\n\nBut how are the transformed rows generated?\n\nLooking at row0 of Example2's output:6,9,9,6,6,6.\n\nOriginal row0:6,9,9. Let's see the input matrix:\n\nRow0:6,9,9\n\nRow1:6,4,4\n\nRow2:6,4,4\n\nMaybe the transformed row0 is created by taking the original row0 and appending the first element of the row below, repeated three times. Row0's next row is row1, first element 6. So appending 6,6,6. That fits. So transformed row0 would be original row0 followed by three 6s.\n\nSimilarly, transformed row1 would be original row1 [6,4,4] followed by the first element of row2 (6) but in Example2's output row1 is [6,4,4,4,4,9]. So the appended part is 4,4,9. Which doesn't fit. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, the appended part is the reverse of the row below. Row1's next row is row2: [6,4,4]. Reversed is [4,4,6]. So appending that would give [6,4,4,4,4,6]. But output row1 is [6,4,4,4,4,9]. So not matching.\n\nAlternatively, the appended part is the first element of the row below, followed by the last element of the current row, repeated. Not sure.\n\nAnother approach: let's look at the last three elements of each transformed row in Example2.\n\nRow0:6,6,6 \u2192 all 6s.\n\nRow1:4,4,9 \u2192 4,4,9.\n\nRow2:4,4,9.\n\nRow3:4,4,6.\n\nRow4:4,4,6.\n\nRow5:9,9,6.\n\nRow0's last three are 6s. Row0's first element is 6. So maybe the last three elements are the first element of the current row, repeated.\n\nYes. For row0, first element is 6, last three elements are 6,6,6. For row1, first element is 6, but last three are 4,4,9. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, the last three elements are the first three elements of the next row. For row0, next row is row1: [6,4,4]. First three elements are 6,4,4. But row0's last three are 6,6,6. No match.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps each transformed row is formed by taking the original row and appending the reverse of the row but with elements transformed in a certain way. For example, in Example2's row0, the original is [6,9,9], reversed is [9,9,6]. Then transforming each element: maybe subtract from 15? 6 \u2192 9, 9\u21926, etc. 6+9=15. So 6\u21929,9\u21926. So reversed row [9,9,6] becomes [6,6,9]. Then appending that to original gives [6,9,9,6,6,9]. But output row0 is [6,9,9,6,6,6]. Hmm, close but not matching.\n\nWait, the last three elements are 6,6,6. If the reversed row [9,9,6] is transformed into 6,6,6, then each element is subtracted from 15: 9\u21926,9\u21926,6\u21929. That gives 6,6,9. Which is not 6,6,6.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each element in the reversed row is replaced by the first element of the original row. So for row0's reversed row [9,9,6], replace each with 6. So appending 6,6,6. That fits. So transformed row is original + all first elements of original.\n\nExample0's row0: [8,6]. Reversed is [6,8]. Replace with first element (8) \u2192 [8,6,8,8]. But output is [8,6,6,8]. Doesn't fit.\n\nHmm.\n\nAnother possibility: the transformed row is original row followed by the first element of the row, then the last element of the row, and then the first element again. For Example2's row0: [6,9,9] followed by 6 (first), 9 (last), 6 (first) \u2192 [6,9,9,6,9,6]. Not matching output.\n\nAlternatively, the transformed row is original row followed by the reverse of the row, but each element is replaced by the first element of the original row. So for row0 of Example2: original [6,9,9], reversed [9,9,6]. Replace each element in the reversed part with 6 \u2192 [6,9,9,6,6,6]. Which matches the output.\n\nYes! This seems to fit.\n\nSo the pattern would be:\n\nFor each input row, the transformed row is the original row followed by the reversed row, but each element in the reversed part is replaced by the first element of the original row.\n\nLet's test this hypothesis.\n\nExample0's row0: [8,6].\n\nReversed row: [6,8].\n\nReplace each element in the reversed part with the first element of the original row (8):\n\n\u2192 [8,6,8,8]. But the output row is [8,6,6,8]. So this doesn't fit. So hypothesis is incorrect.\n\nExample2's row0: reversed row is [9,9,6], replace each element with first element (6) \u2192 [6,6,6]. So transformed row is [6,9,9,6,6,6]. Which matches.\n\nExample1's row0: [7,7,8].\n\nReversed row is [8,7,7]. Replace each element with first element (7) \u2192 [7,7,8,7,7,7]. But output row0 is [7,7,8,8,7,7]. So this doesn't fit.\n\nHmm, this doesn't work for Example1. So maybe another approach.\n\nLooking at Example2's row1: [6,4,4]. Reversed row is [4,4,6]. Transformed row is [6,4,4,4,4,9]. The first element of row1 is 6. So reversed part replaced by 6 would be [6,6,6], but the transformed row's reversed part is [4,4,9]. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternative idea: perhaps the transformed row is the original row followed by the reverse of the next row. For example, in Example2's row0: next row is row1 [6,4,4], reversed is [4,4,6]. Appending that to row0 gives [6,9,9,4,4,6]. But output row0 is [6,9,9,6,6,6]. Doesn't match.\n\nAlternatively, append the reverse of the previous row. But row0 has no previous row.\n\nThis is quite challenging. Let's look for any numeric patterns.\n\nExample0's input:\n\n8 6\n\n6 8\n\nOutput rows:\n\n8 6 6 8\n\n6 8 8 6\n\n6 8 8 6\n\n8 6 6 8\n\nThis looks like a symmetric matrix where each row is the reverse of the previous row.\n\nExample1's output is:\n\n[7,7,8,8,7,7]\n\n[7,7,8,8,7,7]\n\n[8,8,8,8,8,8]\n\n[8,8,8,8,8,8]\n\n[7,7,8,8,7,7]\n\n[7,7,8,8,7,7]\n\nWhich is symmetric vertically and horizontally.\n\nExample2's output is a bit more complex but also symmetric.\n\nPerhaps the pattern is that the output matrix is a 2N x 2M matrix where each element is taken from the input in a specific mirrored fashion, but with some element substitutions.\n\nAlternatively, think of the output as a combination of the original matrix and its mirror images, with certain elements replaced.\n\nAlternatively, consider that each element in the input is expanded into a 2x2 block. For example:\n\nIn Example0's input:\n\n8 \u2192 becomes [8,6]\n\n6 \u2192 becomes [6,8]\n\nBut the output is:\n\n8 6 6 8\n\n6 8 8 6\n\n6 8 8 6\n\n8 6 6 8\n\nSo each element is replaced by a 2x2 block where the element and its neighbor are swapped.\n\nFor example, 8 is replaced by [8,6] and [6,8]. But how does this fit?\n\nAlternatively, each element is replaced by a 2x2 block where the first element is the original, and the others are determined by some rule.\n\nBut I'm not making progress. Maybe I need to look for a different approach.\n\nLooking at the Test Input:\n\nTest Input:\n\n[1,4,1]\n\n[4,9,4]\n\n[9,1,9]\n\nThe input is a 3x3 matrix.\n\nAccording to the pattern from the examples, the output should be a 6x6 matrix. Each input row is transformed into two output rows, and the overall structure is symmetric.\n\nAssuming that each transformed row is the original row followed by its reverse (as in Example0 and Example1), then mirrored vertically in the output.\n\nFor example, each input row is transformed into a row of double the length by appending its reverse. Then the output is the list of transformed rows followed by the reverse of the transformed rows list.\n\nBut let's apply this to the Test Input.\n\nTest Input rows:\n\nRow0: [1,4,1]\n\nRow1: [4,9,4]\n\nRow2: [9,1,9]\n\nTransformed rows would be:\n\nt0: [1,4,1,1,4,1] (original + reversed \u2192 [1,4,1] reversed is [1,4,1], so same as original. So t0 is [1,4,1,1,4,1].\n\nBut wait, no. [1,4,1] reversed is [1,4,1], same as original. So transformed row0 would be [1,4,1,1,4,1]. But in Example1, row0 is [7,7,8] which when reversed is [8,7,7], so transformed row is [7,7,8,8,7,7].\n\nBut in the test case, row0 reversed is same as original. So transformed row0 would be [1,4,1,1,4,1].\n\nRow1: [4,9,4]. Reversed is [4,9,4], so transformed row1 is [4,9,4,4,9,4].\n\nRow2: [9,1,9]. Reversed is [9,1,9]. Transformed row2 is [9,1,9,9,1,9].\n\nThen the output would be the list of transformed rows followed by the reversed list of transformed rows.\n\nSo transformed rows list is [t0, t1, t2], then reversed list is [t2, t1, t0]. So the output would be:\n\nt0\n\nt1\n\nt2\n\nt2\n\nt1\n\nt0\n\nBut each transformed row is duplicated once. Wait, but in Example1, the input has three rows, and the output has six rows. So applying this pattern, the output would be:\n\nRow0: t0 \u2192 [1,4,1,1,4,1]\n\nRow1: t1 \u2192 [4,9,4,4,9,4]\n\nRow2: t2 \u2192 [9,1,9,9,1,9]\n\nRow3: t2 \u2192 [9,1,9,9,1,9]\n\nRow4: t1 \u2192 [4,9,4,4,9,4]\n\nRow5: t0 \u2192 [1,4,1,1,4,1]\n\nBut looking at Example2's output, which has three input rows, the output rows are in the order t0, t1, t2, reversed(t2), reversed(t1), reversed(t0). Which is different. So perhaps the correct pattern is that transformed rows are followed by their reversed versions in reverse order.\n\nWait, but in Example2, the transformed rows are:\n\nt0: [6,9,9,6,6,6]\n\nt1: [6,4,4,4,4,9]\n\nt2: [6,4,4,4,4,9]\n\nThen reversed list of transformed rows is [t2, t1, t0]. And each of these reversed rows are also reversed individually.\n\nSo transformed rows are followed by the reversed transformed rows in reverse order, with each individual row reversed.\n\nSo for the test case:\n\nTransformed rows:\n\nt0: [1,4,1,1,4,1]\n\nt1: [4,9,4,4,9,4]\n\nt2: [9,1,9,9,1,9]\n\nReversed transformed rows in reverse order:\n\n reversed(t2), reversed(t1), reversed(t0).\n\n reversed(t2) is [9,1,9,9,1,9] reversed \u2192 [9,1,9,9,1,9] reversed is [9,1,9,9,1,9]. Wait, no. Reversing the row itself: [1,4,1,1,4,1] reversed would be [1,4,1,1,4,1], since it's a palindrome.\n\nWait, no. Reversing a row means flipping the order of elements. For example, reversing [a,b,c,d] becomes [d,c,b,a]. So for transformed row0 [1,4,1,1,4,1], reversing it would be [1,4,1,1,4,1] (same as original), because it's a palindrome.\n\nBut in Example2's output, row3 is reversed(t2) which is [9,4,4,4,4,6]. So in that case, transformed row2 is [6,4,4,4,4,9], reversed would be [9,4,4,4,4,6]. \n\nSo for each transformed row, we reverse it to get the corresponding reversed row. So for the test case:\n\nt0 reversed: [1,4,1,1,4,1] \u2192 same as t0.\n\nt1 reversed: [4,9,4,4,9,4] \u2192 same as t1.\n\nt2 reversed: [9,1,9,9,1,9] \u2192 same as t2.\n\nSo the reversed transformed rows are the same as the transformed rows. So the output would be t0, t1, t2, t2, t1, t0. Which is the same as the earlier pattern.\n\nBut according to Example2, the reversed transformed rows are different. So perhaps the transformation rule for the rows is different.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformed rows in Example2 are not simply original + reversed, but something else. For Example2's row0, the transformed row is [6,9,9,6,6,6], which is original + [6,6,6]. So perhaps the transformation for each row is original + [first_element] * len(row).\n\nSo for a row of length N, transformed row is original + [first_element] * N.\n\nLet's test this:\n\nExample0's row0: [8,6]. first_element is 8. So transformed row would be [8,6,8,8]. But output row0 is [8,6,6,8]. Doesn't fit.\n\nExample1's row0: [7,7,8]. first_element is7. transformed row would be [7,7,8,7,7,7]. But output is [7,7,8,8,7,7]. Doesn't fit.\n\nExample2's row0: [6,9,9]. first_element is6. transformed row would be [6,9,9,6,6,6]. Which matches.\n\nRow1 of Example2: [6,4,4]. transformed row is [6,4,4,6,6,6]. But output row1 is [6,4,4,4,4,9]. Doesn't fit.\n\nSo this only works for row0 of Example2, not others. So it's inconsistent.\n\nAnother idea: for each row, the transformed row is original followed by the reverse of the row, but with certain elements replaced based on some rule. For example, in Example2's row0, the reversed row is [9,9,6], but the appended part is [6,6,6], which is first element of the row.\n\nBut how?\n\nAlternatively, the appended part is the first element of the row repeated three times. So for any row, transformed row is original + [first_element] * len(row). This works for Example2's row0 and Example0's row0.\n\nExample0's row0: [8,6] \u2192 transformed would be [8,6,8,8]. But output is [8,6,6,8]. Doesn't fit.\n\nHmm.\n\nAt this point, I'm stuck. Perhaps the key is to look for the number of rows and columns. The output is always double the input in both dimensions. So for each input row, generate two output rows, and for each element, generate two elements.\n\nAnother approach: looking at each input row and the corresponding output rows.\n\nExample0's input row0: [8,6] \u2192 output rows0 and3 are [8,6,6,8]. rows1 and2 are [6,8,8,6].\n\nExample1's input rows: each input row leads to two output rows. For row0 and row1 (same), two output rows each. Row2 leads to two output rows.\n\nExample2's input rows: row0 leads to output rows0 and5. row1 leads to rows1,2,3,4.\n\nHmm, this isn't clear. Maybe the output is generated by a combination of horizontal and vertical mirroring with some element transformations.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and the difficulty, perhaps I should proceed to hypothesize that the output is formed by mirroring each row and then mirroring the entire array of transformed rows. So for the test input:\n\nEach row is transformed by appending its reverse. Then, the list of transformed rows is mirrored vertically.\n\nSo:\n\nTest input rows:\n\nRow0: [1,4,1] \u2192 transformed to [1,4,1,1,4,1]\n\nRow1: [4,9,4] \u2192 transformed to [4,9,4,4,9,4]\n\nRow2: [9,1,9] \u2192 transformed to [9,1,9,9,1,9]\n\nThen, mirrored vertically, the output would be:\n\nRow0: [1,4,1,1,4,1]\n\nRow1: [4,9,4,4,9,4]\n\nRow2: [9,1,9,9,1,9]\n\nRow3: [9,1,9,9,1,9]\n\nRow4: [4,9,4,4,9,4]\n\nRow5: [1,4,1,1,4,1]\n\nSo the output would be six rows as above. But let's compare with the examples.\n\nExample1's input rows are three, and the output has six rows arranged as t0, t0, t2, t2, t0, t0. This suggests that perhaps for each input row, the transformed row is duplicated, then mirrored.\n\nBut in the test case, the transformed rows are all palindromes (since the original rows are symmetric), so mirroring would just duplicate them.\n\nBut this doesn't match the complexity of Example2's output.\n\nGiven the time constraints and the need to provide an answer, I'll proceed with the hypothesis that each row is transformed by appending its reverse, and the output is the transformed rows followed by the reversed list of transformed rows. For the test input, this would generate:\n\nTransformed rows:\n\nt0: [1,4,1,1,4,1]\n\nt1: [4,9,4,4,9,4]\n\nt2: [9,1,9,9,1,9]\n\nReversed list: [t2, t1, t0]\n\nSo output rows:\n\nt0\n\nt1\n\nt2\n\nt2\n\nt1\n\nt0\n\nThus, the final output would be:\n\n[1,4,1,1,4,1]\n\n[4,9,4,4,9,4]\n\n[9,1,9,9,1,9]\n\n[9,1,9,9,1,9]\n\n[4,9,4,4,9,4]\n\n[1,4,1,1,4,1]\n\nBut looking at Example2's output, there's more complexity, suggesting that this approach might not be correct. However, given the time I've spent and the need to provide an answer, I'll proceed with this pattern."
