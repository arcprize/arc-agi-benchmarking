        "cot_1": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. So, looking at the training examples, each input is a 2D array, and the output modifies some elements. Let's start with Example 0.\n\nInput:\n[3, 2, 0]\n[0, 0, 0]\n[0, 5, 0]\n\nOutput:\n[8, 0, 0]\n[0, 0, 0]\n[0, 5, 0]\n\nHmm, the first row had 3 and 2. Their sum is 5, but the output is 8. Wait, 3 + 2 is 5, but maybe there's multiplication? 3*2 is 6, which isn't 8 either. Oh, maybe it's the sum of adjacent non-zero numbers. Let me check.\n\nWait, maybe it's looking for consecutive non-zero numbers in the same row and replacing them with their sum. But in Example 0, 3 and 2 are consecutive and non-zero. Their sum is 5, but the output is 8. So that's not it. Maybe it's the product plus something? 3*2=6, still not 8. Wait, 3+5=8? But where does the 5 come from? The third row has a 5. Maybe there's a vertical component.\n\nWait, looking at the output in Example 0, the 3 and 2 in the first row become 8. The 5 in the third row remains. Let's check the other examples.\n\nExample 1's input has rows like [0, 0, 3, 2, 0, 0], which becomes [0,0,8,0,0,0]. So here, 3 and 2 are adjacent and non-zero. Their sum is 5, but output is 8. So again, 3+2=5, but output is 8. So maybe the sum plus 3? 5+3=8. Not sure. Alternatively, maybe 3^2 + 2^2 = 9+4=13, no. Alternatively, 3*2 + (3+2) =6+5=11. Not 8. Hmm.\n\nWait, in Example 0: 3 and 2 in the same row. Output replaces them with 8 and 0. In Example 1, 3 and 2 in the same row are replaced with 8 and 0. So perhaps when two non-zero numbers are adjacent in a row, they are replaced by their sum plus 3? 3+2+3=8. Wait, 3+2=5, but 5+3=8. Where does the 3 come from? Or maybe the sum multiplied by 2 minus 2: 5*2-2=8. Not sure. Let's look for another example.\n\nIn Example 2, the third row of the input is [5,0,2,3,0,0,0], and in the output, it becomes [5,0,0,8,0,0,0]. So here, 2 and 3 are adjacent. Sum is 5, but output is 8 again. So 5 to 8 again. So same as before. So perhaps whenever two non-zero numbers are adjacent in a row, their sum is multiplied by something. Wait, 3+2=5, becomes 8. 5*1.6=8. Not an integer. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the sum plus the count of non-zero numbers in some way. Or maybe there's a different pattern.\n\nWait, 3+2=5. 5 in binary is 101, which is 5. But 8 is 1000. Not sure. Maybe the sum is replaced by 8 when the sum is 5. Wait, 3+2=5 becomes 8, 2+3=5 becomes 8. Wait, but in Example 2, there's another part where the input has [3,2,0,0,0,3,0], which in the output becomes [8,0,0,0,0,8,0]. So here, 3 and 2 are adjacent (sum 5, becomes 8), and then later 3 and 0 and then 3. Wait, maybe that's a different case. Let me check.\n\nWait, the input row in Example 2's test case is [3,2,0,0,0,3,0], and the output is [8,0,0,0,0,8,0]. So the first two numbers are 3 and 2 (sum 5 \u2192 8), then later there's a 3 alone, but in the output, it's replaced by 8. Wait, maybe consecutive non-zero numbers, but in this case, after the first 3 and 2, there's a 0, then another 3. So how does that 3 become 8? Unless there's another rule.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that any group of consecutive non-zero numbers in a row, regardless of their positions, their sum is replaced by the sum multiplied by some factor. But in the first example, 3+2=5 becomes 8. 5*1.6=8. But in Example 1, 3+2=5 becomes 8 again. So maybe 5 becomes 8, but how? Wait, 5 plus 3 equals 8. So maybe adding 3 each time. But why?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's the sum of the two numbers plus the number of non-zero elements in their vicinity. But not sure.\n\nWait, looking at the outputs, the sum of the non-zero adjacent pairs is replaced by 8. So perhaps whenever two non-zero numbers are adjacent in a row, they are replaced by 8, and the others are zeroed out. Wait, but in Example 1's input row [0,0,3,2,0,0], the output is [0,0,8,0,0,0]. So 3 and 2 are replaced by 8 and 0. Similarly, in the same example, the row [0,3,0,0,0,2] becomes [0,8,0,0,0,2]. So here, 3 is replaced by 8, but 2 remains. Wait, no. The input row has 3 and 2 in different positions. Wait, input is [0,3,0,0,0,2], output is [0,8,0,0,0,2]. So 3 is turned into 8, but the 2 at the end is left. So perhaps the rule is different. Maybe it's looking for pairs of non-zero numbers in the same row, not necessarily adjacent? But in Example 0, 3 and 2 are adjacent, in Example 1, 3 and 2 are adjacent. But in the row [0,3,0,0,0,2], the 3 and 2 are not adjacent. But in the output, 3 becomes 8, and the 2 remains. So maybe the rule is that each non-zero number in the row is replaced by the sum of all non-zero numbers in the row. Wait, let's check.\n\nIn Example 0's first row: 3 and 2. Sum is 5. But output is 8. So that doesn't fit. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each non-zero number is replaced by the sum of all non-zero numbers in its column. Let's check Example 0. The columns:\n\nColumn 0: 3,0,0 \u2192 sum 3. But the first row's output is 8. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAnother approach: maybe the pattern involves combining adjacent non-zero numbers in a row, summing them, and replacing them with the sum plus 3. So 3+2=5 +3=8. Then, in the same row, any remaining non-zero numbers are left as is. But in Example 0, the third row's 5 is left. Because there's no adjacent non-zero. So the 5 remains. Let's check Example 1's first row: [5,0,0,0,0,0] remains the same. So 5 has no adjacent non-zero, so it stays. The second row [0,0,3,2,0,0] \u2192 sum 3+2=5+3=8. So replaced with 8 and zeros. Then in the fourth row [0,2,0,0,0,0], the 2 is alone, so remains. But in the output, it's [0,0,0,0,0,0]. Wait, no. Wait in Example 1's input, the fourth row is [0,2,0,0,0,0], and in the output, it's [0,0,0,0,0,0]. So the 2 was turned to zero. Hmm, that contradicts the previous idea. So maybe there's another pattern.\n\nWait, let's look at the fourth row in Example 1's input and output. Input has 2 in the second position, but output has 0. So why did that 2 disappear? Maybe because it's not part of a pair. So perhaps the rule is that any non-zero number that is not part of a pair (adjacent non-zero) is set to zero. But then, in Example 0's third row, 5 is not part of a pair, but it remains. So that's a contradiction. So maybe the rule is more complex.\n\nLooking back at Example 1's fourth row: input [0,2,0,0,0,0] becomes [0,0,0,0,0,0]. So the 2 is turned to 0. But in Example 0's third row, the 5 remains. What's the difference? Maybe in Example 0's third row, the 5 is the only non-zero in the entire column? Let's check the columns. Column 1 in Example 0: first row has 2, third row has 5. So column sum is 2+5=7. Not sure. Alternatively, maybe in the third row, the 5 is not adjacent to any other non-zero, so it's left. But why in Example 1's fourth row, the 2 is turned to 0.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is: for each row, if there are adjacent non-zero elements, replace the leftmost one with their sum plus 3 and set the others to zero. Wait, but in Example 0, the first row's 3 and 2 become 8 and 0. So sum 5 plus 3 equals 8. Then, the 5 in the third row remains. But why?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is that any pair of non-zero numbers in a row, regardless of adjacency, are summed and replaced by their sum plus 3. But that seems arbitrary. Let me check Example 2.\n\nIn Example 2's input, third row is [5,0,2,3,0,0,0]. Output is [5,0,0,8,0,0,0]. So 2 and 3 are adjacent. Their sum is 5, plus 3 gives 8. The 5 at the start is left as is. So maybe when a non-zero is not part of a pair, it's left. Wait, but in Example 1's fourth row, the 2 is not part of a pair but is turned to zero. So that's conflicting.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each row is processed by looking for the leftmost pair of non-zero numbers (adjacent), sum them, replace with sum +3, and set the rest of the row to zero except other non-zero numbers that are not in any pair. But that's getting complicated.\n\nAnother angle: looking for vertical pairs. For example, in Example 0, the 3 is in row 0, column 0. The 5 is in row 2, column 1. Not sure. Let's check the columns.\n\nIn Example 0's output, the 8 is in row 0, column 0. The original input had 3 and 2 in that row. The output replaces them with 8. The third row's 5 remains. So maybe the sum of the row's non-zero elements is calculated. 3+2=5, and 5 becomes 8. How? 5+3=8. So adding 3. Then, the 5 in the third row is left. But why? Maybe the third row's 5 is alone, so it's left as is. So the pattern could be: in each row, if there are multiple non-zero elements, sum them and add 3, then replace the first element with that sum and set the others to zero. But in Example 1's second input row [0,0,3,2,0,0], which becomes [0,0,8,0,0,0], sum is 5, add 3 \u21928. So yes. Then, in the row [0,3,0,0,0,2], sum of 3 and 2 is 5, add 3 to get 8. But in the output, this row becomes [0,8,0,0,0,2]. Wait, the 2 remains. So that contradicts the idea. Unless the rule is to sum all non-zero elements in the row, add 3, and replace the leftmost non-zero element with that sum, and set others to zero. Let's check.\n\nFor Example 1's row [0,3,0,0,0,2], sum is 3+2=5. Add 3 \u21928. Replace the leftmost (3) with 8, set others to zero. So output should be [0,8,0,0,0,0]. But the actual output is [0,8,0,0,0,2]. So the 2 is still there. That doesn't fit. So that's not the pattern.\n\nHmm, this is tricky. Let's try another approach. Let's look at all the examples and see what changes.\n\nIn Example 0's first row: [3,2,0] \u2192 [8,0,0]. So 3 and 2 become 8, and the rest are zeroed. The third row's 5 remains.\n\nIn Example 1's second row: [0,0,3,2,0,0] \u2192 [0,0,8,0,0,0]. So 3 and 2 \u21928. The fourth row [0,2,0,0,0,0] \u2192 [0,0,0,0,0,0]. So 2 becomes 0. The row [0,3,0,0,0,2] \u2192 [0,8,0,0,0,2]. So 3 becomes 8, but the 2 remains. The last row with 3 and 2: [5,0,0,3,0,0] \u2192 [5,0,0,3,0,0]. So 5 and 3 are not adjacent, so they stay.\n\nIn Example 2's input row [3,2,0,0,0,3,0] \u2192 output [8,0,0,0,0,8,0]. So the first 3 and 2 become 8, and the last 3 becomes 8. So maybe even non-adjacent? But how?\n\nWait, maybe the rule is that any two non-zero numbers in the same row, regardless of position, are summed and replaced by 8, but that's not possible because in Example 1's fourth row, there's only a 2 which becomes 0. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each row is processed by replacing the sum of all non-zero elements in that row with 8, and setting all others to zero. But in Example 0's first row sum is 5, but output is 8. So sum is 5 \u21928. But in the third row, sum is 5, but output is 5. So that doesn't fit.\n\nWait, maybe when a row has exactly two non-zero elements, their sum plus 3 becomes 8. For example, 3+2=5+3=8. In Example 1's second row, 3+2=5 \u21928. But in the fourth row, the row [0,2,0,0,0,0] has only one non-zero element (2), so maybe it's set to 0. But in the row [0,3,0,0,0,2], there are two non-zero elements (3 and 2), so sum 5 \u21928. But in the output, the 3 becomes 8 and the 2 remains. So that's conflicting.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule is that in each row, if there are exactly two non-zero elements, replace the left one with their sum plus 3, and the right one becomes zero. If there are more than two, handle the leftmost pair. But how about in Example 2's row [5,0,2,3,0,0,0] \u2192 output [5,0,0,8,0,0,0]. The original has 5, 2, and 3. So three non-zero elements. But the 2 and 3 are adjacent. So they are replaced by 8, and the 5 remains. So maybe the rule is: in each row, find the leftmost pair of non-zero elements (adjacent?), sum them, replace with sum+3, and set the other elements in the pair to zero. The rest of the elements remain as is unless they are part of another pair. So in Example 1's row [0,3,0,0,0,2], the leftmost non-zero is 3. Then, next non-zero is 2. Are they a pair? They are not adjacent, but they are the only two. So perhaps their sum is 5, replaced with 8. But in the output, the 3 becomes 8 and the 2 remains. That doesn't fit. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is to look for any two non-zero numbers in the row (not necessarily adjacent) and sum them. If their sum is 5, replace the first one with 8 and set the others to zero. But in Example 1's row [0,3,0,0,0,2], the sum is 5. Replace the first (3) with 8, set the 2 to zero. But the output has 8 and 2. So that's not it.\n\nThis is getting confusing. Let's look for another pattern. Maybe the numbers are being replaced with their sum multiplied by something. 3 and 2 sum to 5 \u21928. 5 * 1.6 =8. But 1.6 is not a nice number. Alternatively, 3+2=5, which is 5, then 5+3=8. Maybe adding 3. Then, when two numbers sum to 5, add 3. But what about other sums? Let's look at other examples.\n\nIn Example 2's row [3,2,0,0,0,3,0], input, output is [8,0,0,0,0,8,0]. The first 3+2=5 \u21928, then the next 3 is alone, but becomes 8. So maybe any non-zero element in a row where there's a pair elsewhere becomes 8. Or perhaps any non-zero element that is part of a pair (even if not adjacent) gets summed and replaced with 8. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe each non-zero element in a row is replaced by the sum of all non-zero elements in the row multiplied by some factor. For example, in Example 0's first row, sum is 5. 5 * 1.6 =8. But 1.6 is not a whole number. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, each row's non-zero elements are summed, and then each non-zero element is replaced by the sum plus 3. So in Example 0's first row, sum 5 \u21925+3=8. All non-zero elements are replaced with 8. But the output is [8,0,0]. So original non-zero elements were 3 and 2, replaced with 8 and 0. Wait, but the sum is 5, plus 3 is 8. So maybe the first non-zero element is replaced with sum+3, others are zeroed. So in Example 0's first row: 3 is replaced with 5+3=8, 2 is zeroed. But in Example 1's row [0,0,3,2,0,0], sum is 5, so first non-zero is 3, replaced with 8, 2 becomes zero. Which matches the output. In Example 1's row [0,3,0,0,0,2], sum is 5. The first non-zero is 3, replaced with 8. The 2 is left as is. But in the output, the 2 remains. So that's a problem. The output is [0,8,0,0,0,2]. So why is the 2 still there?\n\nWait, maybe the rule is: sum all the non-zero elements in the row, add 3, replace the leftmost non-zero element with this sum, and set all other non-zero elements in the row to zero. But in the row [0,3,0,0,0,2], sum is 5+3=8. Replace the leftmost (3) with 8, and set the 2 to zero. But in the output, the 2 is still there. So that's not right.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is: for each row, the sum of all non-zero elements plus 3, but only if there are exactly two non-zero elements. Otherwise, leave them as is. But in Example 0's first row, two elements, sum+3=8. Third row has one element, so left as is. In Example 1's row [0,0,3,2,0,0], two elements \u21928. The row [0,3,0,0,0,2] has two elements \u2192 sum+3=8. But output leaves the 2. So that's conflicting.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's the product of the non-zero elements plus 3. For Example 0: 3*2=6 +2=8? 3*2 +2=8. Example 1's 3*2 +2=8. Then, if there's only one non-zero element, like 5 in Example 0, it remains. If there's two, replace with product +2. Wait, 3*2=6 +2=8. 3*2+2=8. Then, in Example 1's row [0,3,0,0,0,2], 3*2=6 +2=8. So the product plus 2. Then, replace the leftmost with 8 and set the others to zero. But in the output, the row becomes [0,8,0,0,0,2], which leaves the 2. So that doesn't fit. Unless it's product plus 2, and then the other elements are zeroed except for the last one. That doesn't make sense.\n\nThis is really challenging. Let's try to find another angle. Looking at the outputs, whenever two non-zero numbers are in a row, they're replaced by 8. So maybe the rule is that any two non-zero numbers in the same row, regardless of position, are replaced by their sum plus 3. But then, in Example 2's row [3,2,0,0,0,3,0], output is [8,0,0,0,0,8,0]. So the first 3 and 2 become 8, and the last 3 becomes 8. But how? Maybe each pair of non-zero numbers in the row is converted to 8. But how to handle odd numbers of non-zero.\n\nAlternatively, every non-zero number in a row where there is at least one other non-zero is replaced by 8, and the others are set to zero. So, for Example 0's first row, two non-zero \u2192 both become 8, but the output is [8,0,0]. So maybe the leftmost non-zero becomes 8, others are zeroed. But why? Because the output is [8,0,0], so only the first is replaced. So the rule could be: in each row, if there are multiple non-zero elements, replace the first one with 8 and set the others to zero. But then, in Example 1's row [0,3,0,0,0,2], the first non-zero is 3 \u21928, and the 2 is set to zero. But the output is [0,8,0,0,0,2]. So the 2 is not zeroed. So that contradicts.\n\nWait, maybe the rule is: for each row, if there are two or more non-zero elements, replace the leftmost with the sum of all non-zero elements plus 3, and set the others to zero. If there's only one non-zero, leave it. Let's test:\n\nExample 0's first row: sum 5 \u21925+3=8. Output is [8,0,0]. Yes.\n\nExample 1's row [0,0,3,2,0,0]: sum 5 \u21928. Replace leftmost (3) with 8, others zero. Output is [0,0,8,0,0,0]. Correct.\n\nRow [0,3,0,0,0,2]: sum 5 \u21928. Replace leftmost (3) with 8, others zero. So output should be [0,8,0,0,0,0]. But actual output is [0,8,0,0,0,2]. So the 2 is not zeroed. Hmm, this is conflicting.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is to replace the leftmost two non-zero elements with their sum plus 3, and set the rest to zero. For Example 0, first two non-zero are 3 and 2 \u2192 sum+3=8. Output correct. In Example 1's row [0,3,0,0,0,2], leftmost two are 3 and 2 \u2192 sum+3=8. So replace the 3 with 8, set the 2 to zero. But output has 2 remaining. So that's not right.\n\nThis is really puzzling. Let's look for another pattern. Let's consider the columns. Maybe the sum of a column affects the row. For example, in Example 0's first column, input has 3,0,0 \u2192 sum 3. Output is 8,0,0. So sum of column is 3, but the output's first element is 8. Not sure.\n\nAnother idea: Maybe the numbers are being replaced with the sum of their row and column indices multiplied by some factor. Not likely.\n\nWait, let's check the positions where the 8s appear. In Example 0's output, the 8 is in row 0, column 0. Input had 3 and 2 in that row. In Example 1's output, the 8 is in row 1, column 2 (input 3 and 2). Also, in row 3, column 1 (input 3). Wait, row 3 input is [0,3,0,0,0,2]. Output is [0,8,0,0,0,2]. So the 3 is replaced with 8. But why? Maybe the 3 is in a column that has other numbers. Let's check column 1 in Example 1's input. Column 1 has 0, 0, 0, 3, 2, 0, 0. Sum is 5. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each non-zero number in a row where there is another non-zero in the same column is replaced with 8. For example, in Example 0's first row, 3 is in column 0. Are there any other non-zero in column 0? Yes, no. So maybe that's not it.\n\nAnother approach: Look at the test input and see if applying the pattern from the examples can be guessed.\n\nTest Input:\n\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 5]\n[0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 2, 0]\n[0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 2]\n[5, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0]\n[5, 3, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 2, 0]\n\nLooking for rows that have multiple non-zero elements.\n\nFirst row: 2 and 5. Are they adjacent? No. So if the rule is to replace adjacent pairs, maybe they are left. But according to the examples, non-adjacent pairs might also be handled. For example, in Example 2's row [3,2,0,0,0,3,0], the two 3s are not adjacent, but the output has 8s in both positions. Wait, the input row is [3,2,0,0,0,3,0], output is [8,0,0,0,0,8,0]. So the first two numbers (3 and 2) are replaced by 8, and the sixth element (3) is replaced by 8. So that suggests that any non-zero element in a row where there is at least one other non-zero element is replaced by 8, and others are zeroed. But in that case, why in Example 1's row [0,3,0,0,0,2], the output is [0,8,0,0,0,2]. So the 2 remains. That's conflicting.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is to replace any two non-zero elements in a row with 8, regardless of their position. So in any row with two or more non-zero elements, each non-zero is replaced with 8. But in Example 1's row [0,3,0,0,0,2], the output has 8 and 2. So that's not the case.\n\nAnother observation: All the 8s in the outputs are in positions where there were non-zero elements in the input. So maybe whenever there's a non-zero element in a row that has at least one other non-zero element, replace it with 8, and if it's the only non-zero, leave it. But in Example 1's fourth row [0,2,0,0,0,0], which has only one non-zero, the output is [0,0,0,0,0,0]. So it's zeroed. But in Example 0's third row, there's a single 5, which remains. So why is that?\n\nWait, maybe the rule is: in each row, if there are two or more non-zero elements, replace each non-zero element with 8. If there's exactly one non-zero element, replace it with 0. But Example 0's third row has one 5, which remains. So that contradicts.\n\nAlternatively, the rule could be: if a row has exactly two non-zero elements, replace them with 8 and 0 (the left one becomes 8, right becomes 0). If there are more than two, replace each pair with 8 and 0, but this is getting too vague.\n\nLet's look at the test input and try to apply the pattern we think might be happening. For example, in the test input's second row: [0,2,0,0,0,0,3,2,0]. This row has 2, 3, 2. So three non-zero elements. According to Example 2's row [3,2,0,0,0,3,0], which has three non-zero elements, the output has two 8s. So maybe each pair of non-zero elements is replaced by 8. But how to pair them?\n\nAlternatively, in each row, all non-zero elements are replaced by 8 if there is at least one other non-zero in the row. But the row [0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0] (third row of test input) has only one 3. So it would become 0? But according to Example 0's third row, a single 5 remains. So maybe if there's only one non-zero, it remains unless there's another non-zero in the same column. Not sure.\n\nThis is really tough. Let me try to hypothesize based on the examples:\n\nThe pattern seems to be that in each row, the first occurrence of two or more non-zero elements (possibly adjacent) are replaced by their sum plus 3 (e.g., 3+2=5+3=8), and any subsequent non-zero elements are left as is if they are part of another pair. But this is not consistent across all examples.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is that for each row, the leftmost two non-zero elements are summed, their sum plus 3 is placed in the position of the leftmost one, and the right one is set to zero. Then, if there are more non-zero elements further to the right, repeat the process. Let's test this with Example 2's row [3,2,0,0,0,3,0]. The first two non-zero elements are 3 and 2. Sum+3=8. Replace 3 with 8, set 2 to 0. Now the row becomes [8,0,0,0,0,3,0]. Next, there's a 3 further to the right. Since there's no next non-zero after that, perhaps leave it. But the output is [8,0,0,0,0,8,0]. So the 3 is also replaced with 8. So maybe after processing the first pair, the next non-zero (3) is part of another pair. But there's no other non-zero after it. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each time two non-zero elements are found in the row, they are replaced with 8 and 0, but this isn't systematic.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and the lack of a clear pattern, I'll have to make an educated guess based on the examples.\n\nLooking at the test input's seventh row: [5,3,0,0,0,5,0,2,0]. This row has 5,3,5,2. So multiple non-zero elements. According to the examples, perhaps each pair is replaced with 8. For example, 5 and 3 are the first two. Sum is 8. Then 5 and 2 are next. Sum is 7, but 7+3=10. But examples show sum 5 becoming 8. So maybe regardless of the sum, the replacement is 8. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe whenever two non-zero numbers appear in a row, regardless of their values, they are replaced with 8. So in any row where there's at least two non-zero elements, the leftmost one becomes 8 and the others are zeroed. But in Example 2's row [3,2,0,0,0,3,0], output is [8,0,0,0,0,8,0]. So two 8s. So perhaps after replacing the first pair, the next non-zero is treated as a new pair. But the third 3 is alone, but becomes 8. So maybe if there's an odd number of non-zero elements, the last one is replaced with 8 as well.\n\nThis is really ambiguous. Given the time constraints, I'll proceed with the following hypothesis: in each row, replace every pair of non-zero elements with 8, starting from the left. For example, if there's a non-zero element followed by another non-zero, replace the first with 8 and set the second to zero. Then, continue scanning the row for more pairs. For instance, in a row like [5,3,0,0,0,5,0,2,0], the first pair is 5 and 3 \u2192 replaced with 8 and 0. Then, next non-zero is 5 and 2 \u2192 replaced with 8 and 0. So the row becomes [8,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0]. But the test input's seventh row has four non-zero elements. So two pairs: 5 and 3, then 5 and 2. Both pairs are replaced with 8.\n\nApplying this to the test input:\n\nRow 0: [0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,5] \u2192 2 and 5 are non-adjacent. Are they considered a pair? If the rule is consecutive pairs only, then no. So this row remains as is. But according to Example 1's row [0,3,0,0,0,2], which became [0,8,0,0,0,2], the 3 was replaced with 8, and the 2 remained. So maybe non-consecutive pairs are also considered. In this case, 2 and 5 are non-consecutive. So their sum is 7. 7+1=8? Not sure. Alternatively, replaced with 8. So the first non-zero is 2, then 5. So replace 2 with 8, and 5 with 0? Or both become 8? The examples show that when there are two non-zeros, they are replaced with 8 and 0. So perhaps the first becomes 8, the others become 0. So row 0 becomes [0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0].\n\nRow 1: [0,2,0,0,0,0,3,2,0] \u2192 elements 2, 3, 2. First pair is 2 and 3 (assuming they are consecutive in some way). But they are in positions 1 and 6. Not adjacent. So maybe the first two non-zero elements are 2 and 3. Replace 2 with 8, 3 with 0. Then, the next non-zero is 2. Since there's no pair, it becomes 0. So output row becomes [0,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]. But according to Example 2, when there are three non-zero elements, two are replaced with 8. So maybe in row 1, the first two non-zero (2 and 3) become 8 and 0, and the third 2 becomes 0. So output would be [0,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0].\n\nRow 2: [0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0] \u2192 only one non-zero. According to Example 0's third row, it remains. So output is [0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0].\n\nRow 3: [0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,2] \u2192 non-zero at 5 and 2. Replace first (5) with 8, set 2 to 0. Output: [0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0].\n\nRow 4: [5,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0] \u2192 non-zero at 5 and 2. Replace 5 with 8, 2 to 0. Output: [8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0].\n\nRow 5: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0] \u2192 only one non-zero. So remains. Output: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0].\n\nRow 6: [5,3,0,0,0,5,0,2,0] \u2192 non-zero at 5,3,5,2. First pair 5 and 3 \u2192 replace 5 with 8, 3 \u21920. Then next pair 5 and 2 \u2192 replace 5 with 8, 2 \u21920. So output becomes [8,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0].\n\nPutting it all together:\n\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0]\n[8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0]\n\nBut let's check if this aligns with the training examples. For example, in Example 1's row [0,3,0,0,0,2], the output was [0,8,0,0,0,2]. According to the hypothesized rule, the first pair is 3 and 2. Replace 3 with 8 and 2 with 0. But the output has 8 and 2. So this contradicts. So the rule must be different.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and the possibility that I'm missing a key insight, I'll proceed with the answer that seems to fit most examples, even if there are discrepancies.",

        "cot_2": "Okay, let's look at these training examples and try to figure out the pattern. Hmm, each example has an input matrix and an output matrix. The outputs seem to have some numbers replaced by 0s and some turned into 8s. Let me compare the inputs and outputs closely.\n\nStarting with Example 0:\nInput:\n[3, 2, 0]\n[0, 0, 0]\n[0, 5, 0]\n\nOutput:\n[8, 0, 0]\n[0, 0, 0]\n[0, 5, 0]\n\nHere, the first row's 3 and 2 become 8 and 0. 3 + 2 =5, but 8 is 3*2 + 2? Wait, maybe not. Wait, 3 and 2 are adjacent. Oh, maybe adjacent pairs are summed and replaced? But 3+2=5, not 8. Hmm. Wait, maybe multiplied? 3*2=6. Still not 8. Maybe the sum of consecutive numbers in a row or column?\n\nLooking at the output, in the first row, 3 and 2 are replaced with 8, and the third element is 0. So perhaps when two non-zero numbers are adjacent in a row, they are added (3+2=5) but that's not 8. Alternatively, maybe the sum of all non-zero numbers in a row? But in the first row of Example 0, the sum is 3+2=5, but output is 8. That doesn't fit. Or maybe the product plus some value?\n\nWait, maybe the two adjacent non-zero numbers in the row are replaced by their sum, but only if there are exactly two non-zero numbers. Let's see. Example 0's first row has two non-zero numbers (3 and 2). Their sum is 5, but output is 8. So that's not matching. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's looking for consecutive non-zero numbers in a row. For example, in the first row of Example 0, 3 and 2 are adjacent. Maybe their sum is multiplied by something. 3+2=5, but output is 8. 5*1.6=8? That seems arbitrary. Maybe there's another pattern.\n\nLooking at Example 1's input and output. Let's see:\n\nInput row 1: [0, 0, 3, 2, 0, 0] becomes [0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0]. So here, 3 and 2 are adjacent, and replaced by 8. So that's 3+2=5 again? Not matching. But 3*2=6, plus 2 (the next number?) No. Wait, 3 and 2 sum to 5, but the output is 8. Wait, 3 + 2 + ...? Maybe the sum of all consecutive non-zero numbers in a row? So if there are two consecutive numbers, their sum is replaced by 8. But how 3 and 2 sum to 5, but output is 8. Hmm. Maybe it's a sum multiplied by 1.6, but that's not a clean number.\n\nWait, maybe the two numbers are added, and then multiplied by the count of non-zero numbers in the sequence. For example, in Example 0's first row, two numbers: 3+2=5, multiplied by 2 (the count) gives 10. Not 8. No.\n\nAnother approach: looking for pairs of numbers where when they are adjacent, their sum is replaced by some operation. Let's see:\n\nIn Example 0, the 3 and 2 in the first row become 8. So 3 + 2 =5. 5 +3=8? Not sure. Or 3*2=6, then 6+2=8? Maybe.\n\nIn Example 1's row 1, 3 and 2 become 8. So same as Example 0. 3*2 +2 =8. Wait, 3*2=6 +2=8. But where does the +2 come from? Maybe the position? Like the sum of their positions. For example, if 3 is at index 2 and 2 at index 3. 2+3=5. 3*2=6 +5=11, not 8. Hmm, not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the sum of the two numbers plus the number of non-zero elements in their row. For example, in Example 0's first row, there are two non-zero elements, sum 5. 5 +2=7, still not 8. Not helpful.\n\nWait, maybe the sum of the two adjacent numbers multiplied by 2. 3+2=5 *1.6=8. That would require 1.6, but that's not an integer. Hmm. Maybe there's a different approach.\n\nLooking at Example 2's input and output. Let's take the third row of input: [5, 0, 2, 3, 0, 0, 0] becomes [5, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0]. So here, the 2 and 3 are adjacent and replaced by 8. 2+3=5, but output is 8. Again same as before. 2*3=6, plus 2 equals 8? Where does the 2 come from?\n\nAlternatively, maybe whenever two non-zero numbers are adjacent, their sum is multiplied by 2? 3+2=5 * 1.6=8. Wait 5*1.6=8. But 1.6 is 8/5. Not an integer. So maybe not.\n\nWait, perhaps the product plus the sum. 3*2 +3+2=6+5=11. Not 8. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, the product of the two numbers plus the sum. 3*2 + (3+2) =6+5=11. No. Not 8.\n\nWait, maybe it's the sum of all consecutive non-zero numbers in the row, and replace them with their sum multiplied by some factor. Let's take example 0's first row: 3 and 2. Sum is 5. 5*1.6=8. Example 1's row with 3 and 2: sum 5*1.6=8. Example 2's 2 and 3: sum 5*1.6=8. So perhaps the sum is multiplied by 1.6? But how does 5 become 8? That's a 3/5 increase. Wait 5 +3=8. So adding 3. But why 3?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the two numbers are replaced by their sum plus the number of rows or columns. Not sure. Let's check the dimensions. Example 0 is 3x3. Example 1 is 7x6. Example 2 is 7x7. The 8 in all cases. So that's probably not.\n\nAnother angle: looking for the output 8's in the examples. Each time, there are pairs of non-zero numbers adjacent in the row. So perhaps, whenever two non-zero numbers are adjacent in a row, they are replaced by their sum plus 1, but 3+2=5, plus 3 gives 8. Not sure.\n\nWait, 3 and 2 in Example 0. 3+2=5. 5 plus the next number (0) doesn't help. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps the sum of the two numbers and the numbers adjacent to them. Let's see, in Example 0's first row: 3,2,0. The adjacent numbers are 3 and 2. Sum is 5. Maybe plus 3? 5+3=8. But where does 3 come from. The index? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, think of the numbers as pairs. If two numbers are adjacent, they form a pair. The output is the sum of the pair multiplied by the number of elements in the pair. So for two elements, (3+2)*2=10. Not 8.\n\nAlternatively, the product of the two numbers plus the sum. 3*2 +3+2=6+5=11. Not 8.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the sum of the two numbers multiplied by 2 minus 2. 5*2=10-2=8. That works for Example 0. Let's check others. Example 1's 3 and 2: 5*2-2=8. Yes. Example 2's 2 and 3: sum 5*2-2=8. That works. So the pattern could be: whenever two non-zero numbers are adjacent in a row, replace them with (sum)*2 -2. So (a + b)*2 -2 = 2a + 2b -2. So for 3 and 2: 2*3 +2*2 -2=6+4-2=8. Yes. For 2 and 3: same. \n\nBut wait, how about if there are three non-zero numbers in a row? For example, if a row is [2,3,4], what would happen? According to the pattern, each adjacent pair would be considered. But in the training examples, I don't see such a case. Let's check Example 2's third input row: [5,0,2,3,0,0,0]. The 2 and 3 are adjacent, so they become 8. The 5 is not adjacent to any non-zero, so it remains. So the output is [5,0,0,8,0,0,0]. So in this case, 5 stays as is. So the rule applies only to adjacent pairs, not to longer sequences. So if there are multiple pairs, maybe each pair is processed. But perhaps if there are more than two consecutive non-zero numbers, they are processed in pairs? Let's see.\n\nBut in the training examples, the only pairs are two adjacent non-zero numbers. So the rule seems to be: for any two adjacent non-zero numbers in a row, replace them with (sum)*2 -2. And then set the next positions to zero. Wait, but in Example 0's first row: [3,2,0] becomes [8,0,0]. So after combining 3 and 2, the rest are zero. Similarly, in Example 1, the [3,2] becomes 8 and the next element (which was 0) remains 0. Wait, maybe when two adjacent non-zero numbers are found, they are replaced by their transformed sum, and the rest of the row remains the same except for the next element being zero if necessary.\n\nWait, in Example 0's first row: the input is [3,2,0]. The output is [8,0,0]. So after replacing 3 and 2 with 8, the next element (originally 0) is set to zero. But it was already zero. Hmm. Maybe the transformation replaces the two elements with the result and zeros the rest of the positions to the right? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, when two adjacent non-zero elements are found, they are replaced by 8 (as per the formula sum*2 -2) and the next elements are zeroed out? Or perhaps, each pair is processed, and after replacement, the next element is set to zero to avoid overlapping.\n\nWait, let's look at Example 2's input row 5: [3,2,0,0,0,3,0]. The output is [8,0,0,0,0,8,0]. So here, the first two elements 3 and 2 are replaced by 8, and the 3 at the end (index 5) is adjacent to what? Oh, in the input, row 5 is [3,2,0,0,0,3,0]. So the 3 and 2 are adjacent and become 8. Then the 3 at index 5 is alone? Because the next element is zero. Wait, no. The 3 is at index 5. The previous elements are zeros. So in this row, the 3 at position 5 is non-adjacent to other non-zero numbers. So in the output, it becomes 8. Wait, but according to the earlier pattern, two adjacent non-zero numbers are needed. But here, the 3 is alone. So perhaps there's another rule. Hmm.\n\nWait, in the input for Example 2, row 5 is [3,2,0,0,0,3,0]. The output is [8,0,0,0,0,8,0]. So the first two elements (3,2) become 8, and the fifth element (3) becomes 8 as well. But how? The 3 at index 5 is alone. So maybe there's a different rule here. Or perhaps the 3 is part of a vertical pair? Let's check.\n\nLooking at the input for Example 2:\n\nThird row of input: [5,0,2,3,0,0,0] becomes [5,0,0,8,0,0,0]. So here, the 2 and 3 are adjacent. Sum 5, so 5*2 -2=8. So replaced by 8.\n\nRow 5 input: [3,2,0,0,0,3,0]. So the first two are 3 and 2, which become 8. The 3 at position 5 is not adjacent to anything. But in the output, it becomes 8. So maybe the rule applies to vertical pairs as well? Let's check the columns.\n\nIn Example 2's input, the 3 in row 5 (index 5) is in column 5. Let's see if there's a number above or below it in the same column. Let's see:\n\nLooking at the input for Example 2:\n\nRow 0: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0]\nRow 1: [3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3]\nRow 2: [5, 0, 2, 3, 0, 0, 0]\nRow 3: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\nRow 4: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0]\nRow 5: [3, 2, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0]\nRow 6: [0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0]\n\nThe 3 in row 5, column 5 (assuming columns start at 0) is at position 5 (row 5, column 5). Let's check the column 5 in other rows:\n\nRow 0: 2\nRow 1:0\nRow 2:0\nRow 3:0\nRow4:2\nRow5:3\nRow6:0\n\nSo in column 5, row 0 has 2, row4 has 2, row5 has3. So no adjacent vertical numbers here. So the 3 in row5, column5 is alone. But in the output, it's replaced by 8. So that contradicts the previous pattern. Unless there's another rule.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's looking for pairs in the same column. For example, two adjacent non-zero numbers in a column. Let's check Example 0:\n\nInput column 0: 3,0,0. No pairs. Column 1: 2,0,5. No vertical adjacency. So in Example 0's output, the 5 remains. So perhaps vertical pairs are not considered. So why in Example 2's row5, the 3 is replaced by 8?\n\nWait, maybe the transformation is applied both row-wise and column-wise? Let's check.\n\nIn Example 2's row5, column5: 3. Is there a number below or above it? In row4, column5 is 2, and row6, column5 is 0. So the 3 is not adjacent vertically to any non-zero. So why is it replaced by 8?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is: if a number is part of any adjacent pair (row or column), then it's transformed. But how would that work.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule is that any cell that has exactly two non-zero neighbors (either horizontally or vertically adjacent) is replaced by 8. But that seems more complex, and checking the examples:\n\nIn Example 0, the 3 and 2 in the first row are adjacent. Each has one neighbor. So maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps the sum of a cell and its neighbor(s) equals some value. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the sum of all the non-zero numbers in the row, but only if there are exactly two, and they are replaced by 8. Let's check:\n\nExample 0, row0: two non-zero numbers (3 and 2). Sum is 5. Output is 8. So 5 becomes 8. Example 1's row1 has two non-zero (3 and 2). Sum 5 \u21928. Example2's row5 has three non-zero numbers (3,2,3). Wait, in row5 of input Example2, there are 3,2,0,0,0,3,0. So three non-zero numbers: 3,2,3. But in output, the first two become 8, and the 3 becomes 8. So sum of all non-zero in the row: 3+2+3=8. Oh! Wait, that's interesting. So sum is 8. But how?\n\nWait in Example0's first row sum is 3+2=5. Output is 8. So that doesn't match.\n\nExample1's row1 sum is 3+2=5 \u2192 output 8. So not matching.\n\nHmm.\n\nWait, looking at Example2's row5 input: sum is 3+2+3=8. Output replaces the first pair (3,2) with 8 and the 3 with 8, so total sum is 8+8=16, but that's not relevant. Maybe the sum of the entire row in the input is 8, but in output it's 16. Not sure.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps the number 8 is appearing whenever the sum of a pair of adjacent numbers is 5 (3+2, 2+3), but how 5 becomes 8? Maybe 5 multiplied by 1.6, which is 8. But why 1.6?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the numbers are replaced by their product plus 2. For 3*2=6 +2=8. For 2*3=6+2=8. For 3*3=9+2=11. But in Example1's row3, the input is [0,3,0,0,0,2]. Output is [0,8,0,0,0,2]. So 3 and 0 are adjacent, but the 3 is replaced by 8. Wait, maybe vertical pairs?\n\nIn Example1's row3 input is [0,3,0,0,0,2]. Output is [0,8,0,0,0,2]. So the 3 is alone in the row. So perhaps there's a vertical neighbor. Let's check the column for that 3 in row3, column1.\n\nExample1's input:\n\nRow0: [5,0,0,0,0,0]\nRow1: [0,0,3,2,0,0]\nRow2: [0,0,0,0,0,0]\nRow3: [0,3,0,0,0,2]\nRow4: [0,2,0,0,0,0]\nRow5: [5,0,0,3,0,0]\nRow6: [0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nSo in column1, row3 is 3. Looking up and down:\n\nRow2:0, row4:2. So row3's 3 is between 0 and 2. So vertical neighbors are 0 and 2. So 3 is adjacent vertically to 2 in row4. So 3 and 2 vertically. So sum is 5 \u2192 8. So the 3 in row3, column1 is adjacent (vertically) to 2 in row4, column1. So their sum is 5, and they are replaced by 8 each? Or the 3 becomes 8 and the 2 becomes 0? But in the output, row3's 3 becomes 8, and row4's 2 becomes 0. So in row4's output, the 2 is replaced by 0. So maybe when two numbers are vertically adjacent, their sum is transformed into 8, and the lower one is zeroed out.\n\nBut in Example0's third row: input has 5. Output leaves it as 5. So perhaps the vertical pairs are only when there are two numbers. For example, in Example1's row3 and row4: 3 and 2 are vertical neighbors, so they are transformed into 8 and 0.\n\nSo the pattern could be: for any two adjacent non-zero numbers (horizontally or vertically), replace them with 8 and 0. But how? Let's check:\n\nIn Example1's row3 and row4, column1:\n\nInput has 3 (row3) and 2 (row4). Output has 8 (row3) and 0 (row4). So the sum is 3+2=5. So 8 is 5 plus 3. Or perhaps the sum is replaced by 8, and the lower one is zeroed.\n\nIn Example0's third row: 5 is left as 5. So no vertical pair. So that fits.\n\nIn Example2's row5, the 3 in column5. Let's check vertically:\n\nRow5, column5: 3. Row4, column5: 2. So vertical pair (3 and 2). Sum is 5 \u2192 transformed to 8. So the 3 becomes 8 and the 2 in row4 becomes 0. But in Example2's output, row4 is [0,0,0,0,0,0,0]. So row4's 2 was replaced by 0. And row5's 3 becomes 8.\n\nSo it seems that when two numbers are adjacent vertically, the upper one is replaced by 8 and the lower one is replaced by 0. Similarly, when two numbers are adjacent horizontally, the left one is replaced by 8 and the right one is replaced by 0.\n\nSo the rule could be:\n\n- For each cell in the matrix, check if it has a non-zero neighbor to the right (horizontal) or below (vertical).\n\n- For horizontal pairs: if cell (i,j) and (i,j+1) are non-zero, replace (i,j) with the sum of the pair multiplied by 2 minus 2 (as before), and set (i,j+1) to zero.\n\n- For vertical pairs: if cell (i,j) and (i+1,j) are non-zero, replace (i,j) with sum *2 -2, and set (i+1,j) to zero.\n\nBut wait, let's test this with Example1's row3 and row4, column1.\n\nInput: row3 has 3, row4 has 2. Vertical pair. Sum is 5. 5*2-2=8. So row3's cell becomes 8, row4's becomes 0. Which matches the output.\n\nIn Example0's first row: [3,2,0]. horizontal pair. 3+2=5. 5*2-2=8. So replace 3 with 8, set 2 to 0. Output is [8,0,0].\n\nIn Example2's row5, column5: 3. It has a vertical neighbor in row4 (2). Sum 5 \u21928. So row5's cell becomes 8, row4's cell becomes 0. Which matches the output: row4's output is all zeros except the 2 was set to zero.\n\nBut wait, in Example2's input row4 is [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0]. Output row4 is [0,0,0,0,0,0,0]. So the 2 in column5 was set to zero, which aligns with the vertical pair with row5's 3.\n\nSo the pattern seems to be:\n\nFor each cell (i,j):\n\n1. Check if there's a non-zero cell to the right (i,j+1). If so, replace (i,j) with 8 (sum *2 -2), and set (i,j+1) to zero. This transformation takes priority.\n\n2. If not, check if there's a non-zero cell below (i+1,j). If so, replace (i,j) with 8 and set (i+1,j) to zero.\n\nBut we need to process the matrix in a specific order, perhaps top to bottom, left to right, so that once a cell is processed, the changes don't affect subsequent processing.\n\nBut in Example2's row5, the 3 in column0 (value3) and the next column1 (value2) form a horizontal pair. So they are replaced by 8 and 0. Then, the 3 in column5 is processed. Since row4's cell in column5 is 2, they form a vertical pair. So 3 becomes 8, row4's 2 becomes 0.\n\nSo this seems to work.\n\nNow, let's look at the Test Input and apply this pattern.\n\nTest Input:\n\nRow0: [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 5]\nRow1: [0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 2, 0]\nRow2: [0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\nRow3: [0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 2]\nRow4: [5, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\nRow5: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0]\nRow6: [5, 3, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 2, 0]\n\nProcessing each cell in order (left to right, top to bottom):\n\nLet's go row by row.\n\nRow0: [0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,5]\n\nCheck each cell:\n\nAt cell (0,4)=2. Check right neighbor (0,5)=0. No. Check below (1,4)=0. No. So 2 remains.\n\nCell (0,8)=5. Check right: end of row. Check below (1,8)=0. So remains.\n\nSo row0 remains the same except no changes.\n\nRow1: [0,2,0,0,0,0,3,2,0]\n\nCheck cell (1,1)=2. Right neighbor (1,2)=0. Below (2,1)=3. So vertical pair. Sum 2+3=5 \u21928. So cell (1,1) becomes 8, cell (2,1)=0.\n\nThen cell (1,6)=3. Right neighbor (1,7)=2. Sum 3+2=5 \u21928. So cell (1,6) becomes 8, cell (1,7)=0.\n\nRow1 after processing:\n\n[0,8,0,0,0,0,8,0,0]\n\nBut also, cell (2,1) is set to 0.\n\nRow2: Original [0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]. After setting (2,1) to 0, becomes [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0].\n\nRow3: [0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,2]\n\nCheck cell (3,4)=5. Right neighbor (3,5)=0. Below (4,4)=0. So remains.\n\nCell (3,8)=2. Right neighbor is 0. Below (4,8)=0. So remains.\n\nRow3 remains [0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,2].\n\nRow4: [5,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nCell (4,0)=5. Right neighbor (4,1)=0. Below (5,0)=0. So remains.\n\nCell (4,3)=2. Right neighbor (4,4)=0. Below (5,3)=0. So remains.\n\nRow4 remains [5,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0].\n\nRow5: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0]\n\nCell (5,7)=3. Right neighbor (5,8)=0. Below (6,7)=2. Vertical pair. Sum 3+2=5 \u21928. So cell (5,7) becomes 8, cell (6,7)=0.\n\nRow5 becomes [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0].\n\nRow6: [5,3,0,0,0,5,0,2,0]\n\nCheck cell (6,0)=5. Right neighbor (6,1)=3. Sum 5+3=8. So cell (6,0) becomes 8, cell (6,1)=0.\n\nThen cell (6,5)=5. Right neighbor (6,6)=0. Below: no (last row). So remains.\n\nCell (6,7)=2. Now, after row5 processing, cell (6,7) was set to 0. Wait, row5's processing set cell (5,7)=8 and cell (6,7)=0. So in row6, cell (6,7) is 0.\n\nSo row6 after processing:\n\nCell (6,0) becomes 8, cell (6,1)=0. Then cell (6,5)=5 remains. Others are zero or remain.\n\nSo row6 becomes [8,0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0].\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nRow0: [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 5]\n\nRow1: [0,8,0,0,0,0,8,0,0]\n\nRow2: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow3: [0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,2]\n\nRow4: [5,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow5: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0]\n\nRow6: [8,0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0]\n\nWait, but in row6, the original cell (6,5) is 5. Since there's no neighbor to the right or below (cell (6,5) is 5, next cell is 0, and cell (7,5) doesn't exist), so it remains 5.\n\nBut let's check if there's a vertical pair in row6, cell (6,5)=5. Below it is nothing. So no. So it remains.\n\nSo the final output should be:\n\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 5]\n\n[0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0]\n\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 2]\n\n[5, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0]\n\n[8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0]\n\nBut wait, let's check if other pairs were missed. For example, row4 has [5,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0]. The 5 and 0 in row4, but 2 is in column3. Below row5, column3 is 0. So no vertical pair. So 2 remains.\n\nRow3's 5 and 2: no adjacent pairs.\n\nRow6's 5 in column5. No neighbors.\n\nRow0's 2 and 5 are not adjacent.\n\nSo this seems correct."
