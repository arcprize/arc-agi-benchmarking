        "cot_1": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. So we have these input matrices and output matrices, and I need to find out how the input is transformed into the output. Let me look at the training examples one by one.\n\nStarting with Example 0. The input is three rows: [0,8], [0,0], [0,8]. The output is a 9-row matrix. The first row of the output is [8,0,0,8]. Then a row of zeros, then [8,0,0,8], and this pattern repeats. Wait, let me count the rows. The output has 9 rows. So maybe each row in the input is transformed into three rows in the output? Because the input has three rows, and 3*3=9. Let me check.\n\nOriginal input rows for Example 0: three rows. Output has nine rows, which is three times three. So perhaps each input row generates three output rows. Let's see how each input row is converted.\n\nLooking at the first input row of Example 0: [0,8]. The first three rows of the output are:\n[8,0,0,8]\n[0,0,0,0]\n[8,0,0,8]\nThen the next three rows are similar. Then the same again. Wait, but the input has three rows, and the output has nine rows. So each input row becomes three output rows. Let's check each input row.\n\nFor Example 1, the input is [2,0], [2,2], [2,0]. The output has nine rows again. Let's see. The first output row is [0,2,2,0], then [2,2,2,2], then [0,2,2,0]. Then repeats again. So each input row is generating three output rows. For example, the first input row [2,0] becomes [0,2,2,0], then the second input row [2,2] becomes [2,2,2,2], etc.\n\nBut how exactly is each input row transformed into three output rows? Let's look for the pattern in the numbers.\n\nLooking at Example 0's first input row [0,8]. The output rows generated from this are [8,0,0,8], [0,0,0,0], [8,0,0,8]. So the first and third rows of each trio are the same. The middle row is all zeros. The numbers 8 and 0 from the input row. Hmm. Wait, the input row is [a, b]. Then the output rows are [b, a, a, b], then [a, a, a, a] (but in Example 0, a is 0 and b is 8, so [8,0,0,8], but in the middle row, [0,0,0,0] which is a=0. So maybe middle row is [a,a,a,a]. Then the first and third rows of each trio are [b,a,a,b].\n\nWait, in Example 0, input row [0,8], so a=0, b=8. The first output row is [8,0,0,8] which is b followed by a, a, then b. The middle row is [0,0,0,0] which is a four times. Then again the third row is [8,0,0,8]. So yes, for each input row [a,b], the three output rows are:\n\nRow 1: [b, a, a, b]\n\nRow 2: [a, a, a, a]\n\nRow 3: [b, a, a, b]\n\nThen, when looking at the entire output for Example 0, the input has three rows. Each row is expanded into three rows as above, and the entire output is the concatenation of all three transformed input rows. So 3 input rows * 3 output rows each = 9 rows.\n\nLet's check Example 1. Input rows are [2,0], [2,2], [2,0].\n\nFirst input row [2,0]. Applying the same logic: b=0, a=2. So first output row would be [0,2,2,0], middle row [2,2,2,2], third row [0,2,2,0]. Which matches the first three rows of the output.\n\nSecond input row [2,2]. Here a=2, b=2. So the first and third rows would be [2,2,2,2], middle row [2,2,2,2]. But the output's fourth row is [0,2,2,0], which doesn't fit. Wait, wait. Let me check. Wait, the output for Example 1 is:\n\n[0,2,2,0]\n\n[2,2,2,2]\n\n[0,2,2,0]\n\n[0,2,2,0]\n\n[2,2,2,2]\n\n[0,2,2,0]\n\n[0,2,2,0]\n\n[2,2,2,2]\n\n[0,2,2,0]\n\nHmm, so the pattern is that each input row is transformed into three output rows, but for the middle row of the input, which is [2,2], the transformation would be:\n\na=2, b=2. So first row: [b, a, a, b] \u2192 [2,2,2,2]\n\nmiddle row: [a,a,a,a] \u2192 [2,2,2,2]\n\nthird row: same as first. But in the output, the middle input row's three output rows are [0,2,2,0], [2,2,2,2], [0,2,2,0]. Wait, that's not matching. Wait, maybe I'm missing something here.\n\nWait, Example 1's input is three rows:\n\nRow 1: [2,0]\n\nRow 2: [2,2]\n\nRow 3: [2,0]\n\nSo according to the previous logic, each input row becomes three output rows. Let's check each.\n\nRow 1 [2,0] \u2192 [0,2,2,0], [2,2,2,2], [0,2,2,0] \u2192 that's the first three rows of output.\n\nRow 2 [2,2] \u2192 [2,2,2,2], [2,2,2,2], [2,2,2,2]. But in the output, the next three rows (rows 4-6) are [0,2,2,0], [2,2,2,2], [0,2,2,0]. So that's not matching. So perhaps my initial assumption is wrong.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the entire input is transformed into a 3x3 grid where each element is expanded into a 3x3 block. But the input is 3 rows each with 2 elements. How does that expand into 9 rows of 4 elements each? Hmm, that seems a stretch.\n\nWait, the output for Example 0 is 9 rows, each with 4 elements. Let me check the structure. The output of Example 0 is:\n\nRow 1: [8,0,0,8]\n\nRow 2: [0,0,0,0]\n\nRow 3: [8,0,0,8]\n\nThen rows 4-6 are same as 1-3, and rows 7-9 same again. So the output is three repetitions of the same three rows. Wait, but why? The input is three rows, so maybe each row's transformation is repeated three times? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is arranged in a 3x3 grid of blocks, each block corresponding to an input element. But the input is 3 rows with 2 elements each. Wait, but the output is 9 rows with 4 elements. So 3x3 blocks of 3 rows each? Hmm, perhaps not. Let's try to think differently.\n\nLooking at Example 2's input: [0,0], [0,5], [5,0]. The output is 9 rows. Let's see.\n\nFirst three output rows:\n\n[0,5,5,0]\n\n[5,0,0,5]\n\n[0,0,0,0]\n\nThen the next three rows: [0,0,0,0], [5,0,0,5], [0,5,5,0]\n\nThen the last three: [0,5,5,0], [5,0,0,5], [0,0,0,0]\n\nHmm, this seems more complex. Let's see the input rows.\n\nFirst input row [0,0]. According to the previous logic, a=0, b=0. So first output row would be [0,0,0,0], middle row [0,0,0,0], third row [0,0,0,0]. But the actual first three output rows are [0,5,5,0], [5,0,0,5], [0,0,0,0]. So that doesn't fit. So my initial hypothesis is invalid.\n\nWait, perhaps each input element is being transformed into a 3x3 grid. But how? The input has 3 rows with 2 elements each (total 6 elements), and the output has 9 rows with 4 elements each (total 36 elements). So maybe each input element is expanded into a 3x3 block, but that would be 6*9=54 elements, which doesn't fit. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each row of the input is transformed into a 3x4 matrix. Wait, but input rows are two elements. Let me think: For example, in Example 0, the input is three rows of two elements each. The output is nine rows of four elements each. So for each row in the input, three rows are generated in the output, each with four elements. So for the first input row [0,8], three output rows are generated. Let's see how those three rows are generated.\n\nThe three rows for [0,8] are [8,0,0,8], [0,0,0,0], [8,0,0,8]. So the first and third are the same, middle is zeros. The elements 8 and 0 are in positions that mirror the input. The four elements in the first output row are 8,0,0,8. So perhaps the first and fourth elements are the second element of the input pair, and the middle two are the first element. So for [a, b], the first and third output rows are [b, a, a, b], and the middle row is [a, a, a, a]. That seems to hold for Examples 0 and 1.\n\nIn Example 0, input row [0,8] \u2192 first and third rows are [8,0,0,8], middle row [0,0,0,0]. Which matches. For Example 1's first row [2,0], first and third output rows are [0,2,2,0], middle [2,2,2,2]. That works. Then, the second row in Example 1's input is [2,2]. Applying the same logic, first and third rows would be [2,2,2,2], middle row [2,2,2,2]. But looking at the output for Example 1, the second input row [2,2] would generate three rows, but in the output, after the first three rows (from first input row), the next three rows are [0,2,2,0], [2,2,2,2], [0,2,2,0]. Wait, but according to the pattern, the second input row [2,2] should generate three rows of [2,2,2,2]. But the actual output rows 4-6 are the same as rows 1-3. That suggests that perhaps each input row is transformed into three rows, but then the entire input is processed three times, leading to 3*3=9 rows. But that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the entire input is processed as a cycle, repeating three times. But that doesn't fit with the first example.\n\nWait, looking at Example 0's output: the first three rows are from the first input row. Then the next three rows are same as the first three. Then again the same. So why is that? The input has three rows, but the output is nine rows. If each input row is processed three times, but that would make 3*3=9. So for each input row, generate three rows (as per the a,b pattern), but then process each input row three times in a row? Or perhaps the entire input is processed three times, leading to 3*3=9 output rows. Wait, Example 0's input is three rows. Processing each row once gives three output rows, but in the output there are nine. So processing each row three times? That would make 3 rows *3=9. But in Example 0's output, the first three rows are for the first input row, then the next three for the same first row again? That doesn't fit.\n\nWait, maybe the output is generated by taking each input row, transforming it into three rows, and then concatenating the transformations of all three input rows. So input has three rows \u2192 each generates three output rows \u2192 3 *3=9. Let's check Example 0 again. Input rows are [0,8], [0,0], [0,8]. Let's see:\n\nFirst input row [0,8] \u2192 three rows: [8,0,0,8], [0,0,0,0], [8,0,0,8]\n\nSecond input row [0,0] \u2192 three rows: [0,0,0,0], [0,0,0,0], [0,0,0,0]\n\nThird input row [0,8] \u2192 same as first.\n\nSo combining all three, the output would be:\n\nFirst three rows from first input row: [8,0,0,8], [0,0,0,0], [8,0,0,8]\n\nNext three from second input row: [0,0,0,0], [0,0,0,0], [0,0,0,0]\n\nNext three from third input row: [8,0,0,8], [0,0,0,0], [8,0,0,8]\n\nBut the actual output for Example 0 is:\n\n[8,0,0,8]\n\n[0,0,0,0]\n\n[8,0,0,8]\n\n[8,0,0,8]\n\n[0,0,0,0]\n\n[8,0,0,8]\n\n[8,0,0,8]\n\n[0,0,0,0]\n\n[8,0,0,8]\n\nWhich is nine rows. Wait, but according to the above logic, the output would be 3 rows (first input) + 3 rows (second input) + 3 rows (third input) = 9 rows. But according to that, the second input row's three rows are all zeros. But the actual output for Example 0 has rows with zeros and 8s. So that doesn't fit. So perhaps the initial approach is wrong.\n\nAlternative approach: Let's look at the outputs and see if there's a pattern in the numbers.\n\nLooking at Example 0's output, the first row is [8,0,0,8]. Then the second row is all zeros. The third row is same as first. Then the fourth same as first, fifth same as second, etc. So it seems like a repetition of a three-row pattern three times. So the first three rows are repeated three times. But why? The input has three rows. Maybe each input row is generating the same three-row block, but that doesn't align with the input.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is a mirror or reflection of the input. For example, each row in the input is mirrored or expanded in some way. Let's take the first example's input [0,8] \u2192 output row [8,0,0,8]. That looks like the original elements [0,8] are mirrored with some duplication. Like 8,0,0,8. Maybe the input's two elements are being turned into four elements by mirroring and adding the reverse. So [a, b] becomes [b, a, a, b]. That would fit for Example 0's first input row [0,8] \u2192 [8,0,0,8]. Similarly, Example 1's first row [2,0] \u2192 [0,2,2,0], which matches. Then the middle row is [a,a,a,a]. So for the input row [a,b], the three output rows are [b,a,a,b], [a,a,a,a], [b,a,a,b]. So each input row generates three output rows. Then, the entire input's three rows generate 3*3=9 rows. Let's check this with Example 2.\n\nExample 2's input is [0,0], [0,5], [5,0].\n\nFirst input row [0,0]. Applying the pattern: [0,0,0,0], [0,0,0,0], [0,0,0,0].\n\nSecond input row [0,5]: [5,0,0,5], [0,0,0,0], [5,0,0,5].\n\nThird input row [5,0]: [0,5,5,0], [5,5,5,5], [0,5,5,0].\n\nWait, but let's see the actual output for Example 2:\n\n[0,5,5,0]\n\n[5,0,0,5]\n\n[0,0,0,0]\n\n[0,0,0,0]\n\n[5,0,0,5]\n\n[0,5,5,0]\n\n[0,5,5,0]\n\n[5,0,0,5]\n\n[0,0,0,0]\n\nHmm, that doesn't fit. The first three rows would be from the first input row [0,0] \u2192 [0,0,0,0], [0,0,0,0], [0,0,0,0]. But in the actual output, the first three rows are [0,5,5,0], [5,0,0,5], [0,0,0,0]. So this contradicts the earlier pattern. So maybe the earlier hypothesis is wrong.\n\nAlternative idea: perhaps each element in the input matrix is being transformed into a 3x3 block. But the input is 3x2, so 3 rows, 2 columns. If each element becomes a 3x3 block, then the output would be 9x6. But the output is 9x4, so that's not matching.\n\nWait, maybe the input is being mirrored or rotated. For example, each row is reversed and concatenated, but scaled. Let's see:\n\nIn Example 0's input, the first row is [0,8]. Maybe it's mirrored to [8,0], then duplicated in some way. But the output row is [8,0,0,8]. That could be the original row reversed and then concatenated: [0,8] reversed is [8,0], then combined with [0,8] again \u2192 but that gives [8,0,0,8]. Oh, that's possible. So for each input row [a,b], the first output row is [b, a, a, b]. Then the next row is [a,a,a,a], then [b,a,a,b]. So each input row contributes three rows: the first and third are mirrored and duplicated, the middle is all a's.\n\nIf that's the case, then let's check Example 2's input.\n\nExample 2 input rows:\n\nRow 1: [0,0]\n\nRow 2: [0,5]\n\nRow 3: [5,0]\n\nApplying the transformation:\n\nRow 1 [0,0]:\n\nOutput rows would be [0,0,0,0], [0,0,0,0], [0,0,0,0]\n\nRow 2 [0,5]:\n\nOutput rows would be [5,0,0,5], [0,0,0,0], [5,0,0,5]\n\nRow 3 [5,0]:\n\nOutput rows would be [0,5,5,0], [5,5,5,5], [0,5,5,0]\n\nBut the actual output for Example 2 is:\n\nRow 1: [0,5,5,0]\n\nRow 2: [5,0,0,5]\n\nRow 3: [0,0,0,0]\n\nThen rows 4-6: [0,0,0,0], [5,0,0,5], [0,5,5,0]\n\nRows 7-9: [0,5,5,0], [5,0,0,5], [0,0,0,0]\n\nHmm, this doesn't match the earlier pattern. So perhaps there's another layer of transformation. Let's see if the rows are being transformed based on their position in the input. For example, the first row of the input is transformed differently than the second and third.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is built by combining the transformed rows in a different order. Let's look at Example 2's output.\n\nThe output starts with [0,5,5,0], which comes from the third input row [5,0] transformed as [0,5,5,0]. Then the second row of output is [5,0,0,5], which is from the second input row [0,5] transformed as [5,0,0,5]. Then third row is zeros. Then the next three rows are [0,0,0,0], [5,0,0,5], [0,5,5,0]. Then the last three are again [0,5,5,0], [5,0,0,5], [0,0,0,0]. So the order of transformed rows is 3rd input row, then 2nd, then 1st, then 1st again, then 2nd, then 3rd, etc. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the input rows are transformed in a way that their order is reversed or alternated. But I'm not seeing a clear pattern here.\n\nAnother approach: let's look at the Test Input and see if applying the initial hypothesis works. The test input is:\n\n[3,3]\n\n[3,0]\n\n[3,3]\n\nAssuming each input row is transformed into three output rows: first and third rows of the trio are [b, a, a, b], middle row is [a,a,a,a].\n\nSo for the first input row [3,3], a=3, b=3. So first and third rows would be [3,3,3,3], middle row [3,3,3,3].\n\nSecond input row [3,0]: a=3, b=0. First and third rows [0,3,3,0], middle row [3,3,3,3].\n\nThird input row [3,3], same as first.\n\nSo combining all three input rows transformed into three rows each:\n\nFirst trio:\n\n[3,3,3,3]\n\n[3,3,3,3]\n\n[3,3,3,3]\n\nSecond trio:\n\n[0,3,3,0]\n\n[3,3,3,3]\n\n[0,3,3,0]\n\nThird trio:\n\n[3,3,3,3]\n\n[3,3,3,3]\n\n[3,3,3,3]\n\nSo the output would be nine rows, all either [3,3,3,3], [0,3,3,0], or [3,3,3,3].\n\nBut let's check how the training examples would fit this.\n\nIn Example 0, the first and third input rows are [0,8]. So their transformation would be [8,0,0,8], [0,0,0,0], [8,0,0,8]. The second input row [0,0] would produce three rows of zeros. But the output for Example 0 is:\n\n[8,0,0,8]\n\n[0,0,0,0]\n\n[8,0,0,8]\n\n[8,0,0,8]\n\n[0,0,0,0]\n\n[8,0,0,8]\n\n[8,0,0,8]\n\n[0,0,0,0]\n\n[8,0,0,8]\n\nWhich matches the first input row's trio repeated three times. But according to the transformation of each input row, the first trio is from row 1, then row 2, then row 3. But in the example, all three input rows are [0,8], [0,0], [0,8]. So the output would have three trios:\n\nRow1-3: [8,0,0,8], zeros, [8,0,0,8]\n\nRow4-6: zeros three times\n\nRow7-9: [8,0,0,8], zeros, [8,0,0,8]\n\nBut the actual output has the same trio (row1-3) repeated three times. So this suggests that maybe each input row is processed three times in a row, but that doesn't make sense. Or perhaps there's a different pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is created by taking each input row and generating three copies of its transformed trio. For example, in Example 0, each input row's trio is repeated three times. But that doesn't align with the input having three rows. This is getting confusing.\n\nWait, let's count how many times each trio appears in the output. For Example 0, the output has three copies of the first input row's trio. Because the input rows are [0,8], [0,0], [0,8], but the output has three copies of [8,0,0,8], zeros, [8,0,0,8]. So the first and third input rows' trios are merged. But why?\n\nAlternative idea: the entire input is treated as a 3x2 grid, and the output is a 3x3 grid where each cell is a 3x4 block. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is generated by arranging the input rows in a certain way and expanding them. For example, the output for Example 0 is three repetitions of the transformed first input row. But why?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation involves the sum of adjacent elements or some other operation. For example, in Example 2's output, the first row is [0,5,5,0], which could be combining elements from the input rows. The second input row is [0,5], third is [5,0]. So maybe the first row of the output combines the second and third input rows.\n\nThis is getting too vague. Maybe I should look for another pattern. Let's consider that the output is created by taking each input row and creating a 3x4 block, and then stacking them vertically. But how?\n\nAnother observation: in Example 0's output, each trio of rows is the same. So the output is three copies of the same trio. Similarly, Example 1's output has the same trio repeated three times. Example 2's output, however, has a different structure. So perhaps there's a different rule.\n\nWait, let's look at Example 2's input:\n\n[0,0]\n\n[0,5]\n\n[5,0]\n\nThe output is:\n\n[0,5,5,0]\n\n[5,0,0,5]\n\n[0,0,0,0]\n\n[0,0,0,0]\n\n[5,0,0,5]\n\n[0,5,5,0]\n\n[0,5,5,0]\n\n[5,0,0,5]\n\n[0,0,0,0]\n\nThis output seems to have a pattern where certain blocks repeat. The first three rows are different from the next three and the last three. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is a combination of the input rows' transformations, but in a way that combines elements from multiple input rows. For example, each output row could be a combination of two input rows. But I'm not sure.\n\nAnother idea: the output could be a 3x3 grid where each cell is a 3x4 block, but arranged in a specific way. However, the output rows have four elements, which doesn't fit a 3x3 grid directly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is generated by rotating or shifting the input elements in a certain way. For example, the first row of the input becomes the first row of the output, then shifted, then shifted again. But I'm not seeing that.\n\nLet me try to find a pattern in the numbers across the examples.\n\nIn Example 0:\n\nInput rows:\n\n[0,8], [0,0], [0,8]\n\nOutput rows start with 8 and 0. The 8s are from the input's second element in the first and third rows.\n\nIn Example 1:\n\nInput rows:\n\n[2,0], [2,2], [2,0]\n\nOutput rows start with 0 and 2. The 0s are from the second element of the first and third input rows.\n\nIn Example 2:\n\nInput rows:\n\n[0,0], [0,5], [5,0]\n\nOutput rows have 5 and 0. The 5s are from the second element of the second input row and first element of the third.\n\nThis suggests that the output rows are formed by taking elements from different positions in the input rows. Perhaps each output row is constructed by combining elements from adjacent input rows.\n\nAnother approach: for each output row, find which input elements contribute.\n\nExample 0's first output row: [8,0,0,8]. The 8s come from the second element of the first input row [0,8], and the 0s from the first element. Similarly, maybe the first and third elements are mirrored.\n\nIn Example 1's first output row [0,2,2,0], the 0 and 2 are from the first input row [2,0].\n\nExample 2's first output row [0,5,5,0] combines the second element of the second input row [0,5] (5) and the first element of the third input row [5,0] (5). But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, each output row is formed by combining two input elements. For example, the first two elements of the output row come from one input element, and the last two from another.\n\nAlternatively, the output rows are created by concatenating pairs of elements from the input rows. For example, the first output row of Example 0 is [8,0,0,8], which could be the second element of the first input row (8), then the first element (0), then again the first element (0), then the second element (8).\n\nThis aligns with the earlier hypothesis where for an input row [a,b], the first and third output rows are [b,a,a,b], and the middle row is [a,a,a,a]. So let's check this against Example 2's output.\n\nExample 2's first input row [0,0]. Applying the pattern, the first and third rows would be [0,0,0,0], and the middle row [0,0,0,0]. But in the output, the first three rows are [0,5,5,0], [5,0,0,5], [0,0,0,0]. These correspond to different input rows. So this suggests that the transformation isn't applied per input row but possibly per column or across multiple rows.\n\nMaybe the output is constructed by taking pairs of input rows and transforming them. For Example 2, input rows are [0,0], [0,5], [5,0]. The first output row is [0,5,5,0], which could be combining the second and third input rows. The 0 from [0,5] and 5 from [5,0]. But how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each output row corresponds to a combination of two input elements from different positions. For example, the first output row of Example 2 is [0,5,5,0], which could be the second element of the second input row (5) and the first element of the third input row (5). But the 0s are from where?\n\nAlternatively, the output is generated by arranging the input elements in a certain pattern, like a cross or a diamond.\n\nAnother observation: in Example 2's output, the middle row of the entire output is [5,0,0,5], which is the same as the second row of the output. So perhaps there's a central pattern.\n\nThis is getting quite complex. Let's try to approach the test input with the initial hypothesis and see if it makes sense.\n\nTest input:\n\n[3,3]\n\n[3,0]\n\n[3,3]\n\nApplying the initial per-row transformation:\n\nFirst input row [3,3] \u2192 a=3, b=3. So first and third rows of trio: [3,3,3,3], middle row [3,3,3,3].\n\nSecond input row [3,0] \u2192 first/third rows [0,3,3,0], middle row [3,3,3,3].\n\nThird input row [3,3] \u2192 same as first.\n\nSo the output would be:\n\nRow1: [3,3,3,3]\n\nRow2: [3,3,3,3]\n\nRow3: [3,3,3,3]\n\nRow4: [0,3,3,0]\n\nRow5: [3,3,3,3]\n\nRow6: [0,3,3,0]\n\nRow7: [3,3,3,3]\n\nRow8: [3,3,3,3]\n\nRow9: [3,3,3,3]\n\nBut looking at the training examples, especially Example 1 and 0, the middle row of each trio is all a's. So for input row [3,3], a=3, so middle row is [3,3,3,3]. So the output would indeed have rows filled with 3s and some 0s from the second input row.\n\nBut the training examples show that in Example 0, the middle row of the trio is all a's (0 in that case), and first/third rows are [b,a,a,b]. So if this pattern holds, then the test input's output should have:\n\nFor each input row:\n\nRow [3,3] \u2192 [3,3,3,3], [3,3,3,3], [3,3,3,3] (since a and b are both 3)\n\nRow [3,0] \u2192 [0,3,3,0], [3,3,3,3], [0,3,3,0]\n\nRow [3,3] \u2192 same as first.\n\nSo combining all three input rows' transformations:\n\nFirst three rows: all [3,3,3,3]\n\nNext three: [0,3,3,0], [3,3,3,3], [0,3,3,0]\n\nNext three: all [3,3,3,3]\n\nBut looking at the training examples, the output for Example 0 has the first input row's trio repeated three times. Similarly, Example 1 has the same trio repeated three times, which corresponds to all input rows being the same except the middle one. Wait, Example 1's input is [2,0], [2,2], [2,0]. The output has the same trio repeated three times. But according to the per-row transformation, the middle input row's trio would be [2,2,2,2], but in the output, it's the same as the first and third input rows' transformation. So this suggests that the transformation is not applied per input row but perhaps to the entire input as a whole.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is constructed by taking the first input row's transformation, then the second's, then the third's, then repeating the entire sequence twice more. For Example 0, the three input rows are transformed into three trios, then the entire sequence is repeated two more times for a total of nine rows. But Example 0's input has three rows, and the output has nine rows, which would mean each input row's trio is processed once, but in the output, the trios are repeated three times. That doesn't fit the examples.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking each row's transformation and stacking them, then doing this for each column. But I'm not sure.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and the need to find a solution, I'll proceed with the initial hypothesis and see if it fits the test case. Applying the per-row transformation:\n\nTest input rows:\n\nRow 1: [3,3] \u2192 [3,3,3,3], [3,3,3,3], [3,3,3,3]\n\nRow 2: [3,0] \u2192 [0,3,3,0], [3,3,3,3], [0,3,3,0]\n\nRow 3: [3,3] \u2192 same as row1.\n\nSo combining these, the output would be:\n\n[3,3,3,3]\n\n[3,3,3,3]\n\n[3,3,3,3]\n\n[0,3,3,0]\n\n[3,3,3,3]\n\n[0,3,3,0]\n\n[3,3,3,3]\n\n[3,3,3,3]\n\n[3,3,3,3]\n\nBut looking at the training examples, particularly Example 1 where the middle input row is [2,2], which would generate all 2s, but in the output, it's the same as the other rows. So maybe there's an error in the initial hypothesis. Perhaps the transformation is applied to each input row, but only the first and third rows of the input are used, ignoring the middle row. Or the middle row is transformed differently.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by mirroring the input rows and then stacking them in a certain way. For example, each input row is mirrored and then stacked vertically three times. For Example 0, input row [0,8] becomes [8,0,0,8], and this is repeated three times. Then the next input row [0,0] becomes [0,0,0,0], repeated three times, and so on.\n\nBut in Example 0's output, the first three rows are from the first input row, then the next three from the first input row again, etc. So perhaps the output is generated by taking each input row and repeating its transformation three times. So each input row's trio is repeated three times, leading to 3 input rows * 3 repeats each = 9 output rows. But this seems to fit Example 0 and 1.\n\nExample 0's input rows are [0,8], [0,0], [0,8]. Each row's transformation is repeated three times. So the output would have three repetitions of each row's trio, but Example 0's output has the same trio three times in a row, which could be from the first input row being processed three times. But this is unclear.\n\nGiven the time constraints, I'll proceed with the initial per-row transformation for the test input and see if the answer fits the examples. So the test input's output would be:\n\n[3,3,3,3]\n\n[3,3,3,3]\n\n[3,3,3,3]\n\n[0,3,3,0]\n\n[3,3,3,3]\n\n[0,3,3,0]\n\n[3,3,3,3]\n\n[3,3,3,3]\n\n[3,3,3,3]\n\nBut looking at the training examples, this structure doesn't match. For instance, in Example 1, the middle input row is [2,2], which would generate three rows of [2,2,2,2]. But in Example 1's output, the middle trio is the same as the first and third trios, which doesn't align with this. This suggests that the initial hypothesis is incorrect.\n\nPerhaps the transformation involves more than just the individual rows. Maybe the columns are also involved. For example, each element in the input is combined with elements from adjacent rows or columns.\n\nAnother observation: in Example 2's input, the third row is [5,0]. The first output row is [0,5,5,0]. Which could be formed by taking the third row's elements reversed and concatenated: [5,0] reversed is [0,5], then concatenated with [5,0] again \u2192 [0,5,5,0]. But how does that fit with the other elements?\n\nAlternatively, each output row is a combination of two input rows, reversed and concatenated. For example, the first output row of Example 2 combines the second and third input rows: [0,5] and [5,0] reversed to [0,5] \u2192 [0,5,5,0]. The second row of the output could be [5,0,0,5], which is the third input row [5,0] reversed to [0,5], then the second input row [0,5] reversed to [5,0], concatenated \u2192 [5,0,0,5]. But this is speculative.\n\nAssuming this is the case, for the test input:\n\nInput rows:\n\nRow1: [3,3]\n\nRow2: [3,0]\n\nRow3: [3,3]\n\nSo the first output row might combine row2 and row3 reversed. Row2 is [3,0], row3 reversed is [3,3]. So combining [3,0] and [3,3] gives [3,0,3,3], but that doesn't fit. Alternatively, combining row3 and row2 reversed: [3,3] and [0,3], resulting in [3,3,0,3]. Not sure.\n\nThis approach isn't yielding clear results. Given the time I've spent, I'll proceed with the initial hypothesis and submit the answer based on that.",

        "cot_2": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. So, the problem is to take a 3x2 input grid and transform it into a 9x4 output grid. Let's look at the training examples to see what's going on.\n\nStarting with Example 0. The input is three rows: [0,8], [0,0], [0,8]. The output is a 9-row grid. Hmm, maybe each row in the input is being expanded into three rows in the output? Because 3 input rows become 9, which is 3 times 3. Let's check the structure.\n\nLooking at the output of Example 0. The first three output rows are:\n[8,0,0,8]\n[0,0,0,0]\n[8,0,0,8]\nThen the next three are similar, and the next three again. Wait, maybe each input row is generating three output rows, but with some pattern. Let's break it down per input row.\n\nTake the first input row of Example 0: [0,8]. The output's first three rows seem to be related. The first output row is [8,0,0,8], the second [0s], the third [8,0,0,8]. Then this pattern repeats for the next input rows. So maybe each input element is creating a 3x2 block in the output, but arranged in a specific way.\n\nWait, let's look at the input rows. Each input row has two elements. For example, in Example 1, input is [2,0], [2,2], [2,0]. The output starts with [0,2,2,0], [2,2,2,2], [0,2,2,0], and repeats this three times. So each input row is converted into three rows in the output. But how?\n\nAnother observation: The output grid is 9 rows by 4 columns. So each input row (which has two elements) is transformed into three output rows, each of four elements. So each input element might be contributing to two elements in the output, perhaps mirrored or arranged in a certain pattern.\n\nLet me take Example 0's first input row [0,8]. The output for this row's part is three rows. The first and third rows are [8,0,0,8], and the middle row is all zeros. Wait, where does 8 come from? The original elements are 0 and 8. So maybe the elements are being reversed? Like 8 comes first in the output row. Let's see: [0,8] becomes [8,0,0,8]. That's like taking the second element first, then first, then first again, then second again? Or maybe it's mirrored. Because 8,0 and then 0,8. Wait, 8,0 followed by 0,8 would make 8,0,0,8. So that's taking the elements in reverse order and then original order, but concatenated. So for [a,b], the output row is [b, a, a, b]?\n\nWait, in Example 0, the first input row is [0,8], and the first output row is [8,0,0,8]. So [0,8] becomes [8,0,0,8]. So it's [b, a, a, b]. Let's check Example 1: Input row [2,0] would become [0,2, 2, 0], which matches the first output row. Yes, that seems right. So each input row's elements are transformed into a four-element row by taking [b, a, a, b]. Then, perhaps for each input row, we generate three rows: the first and third are [b,a,a,b], and the middle row is [a,a,a,a] if the original row's elements are the same, or something else?\n\nWait, let's look at Example 0's input. The first and third input rows are [0,8], and the middle is [0,0]. The output for the first input row's part is [8,0,0,8], then [0,0,0,0], then [8,0,0,8]. Similarly, the middle input row [0,0] would generate three rows, but according to the output, the middle input row's part is [0,0,0,0], [0,0,0,0], [0,0,0,0], but in the actual output, for example, the middle input row [0,0] in Example 0's input leads to the second row in each group of three being all zeros. Wait, perhaps each input row is generating three output rows: the first and third are [b,a,a,b], and the middle row is a combination of the sum or something else.\n\nWait, in Example 0, the first input row is [0,8]. The three output rows for that input row are:\n\nRow 1: [8,0,0,8] \u2192 which is [b,a,a,b], where a=0, b=8.\n\nRow 2: [0,0,0,0] \u2192 which is [a,a,a,a].\n\nRow 3: [8,0,0,8] \u2192 same as row 1.\n\nThen, the next input row is [0,0], and its output rows are:\n\nRow 4: [0,0,0,0], then [0,0,0,0], then [0,0,0,0].\n\nThen the third input row [0,8] again produces the same as the first.\n\nSo the pattern seems to be: for each input row [a,b], generate three output rows:\n\n1. [b, a, a, b]\n\n2. if a and b are the same, then [a,a,a,a], otherwise [something else?]\n\nWait, in Example 0, the first input row [0,8] (a=0, b=8), the middle row is all a's. But in Example 1, the first input row is [2,0], a=2, b=0. The middle row is [2,2,2,2], which is all a's? Wait, no. Wait, [a, a, a, a] would be 2,2,2,2 here. But in the middle row, it's [2,2,2,2]. So yes, for a=2 and b=0, the middle row is all a's. But in Example 0, a=0, b=8, the middle row is all 0s, which is a. So perhaps the middle row is [a,a,a,a], regardless of b.\n\nSo the pattern for each input row [a,b] is three output rows:\n\n1. [b, a, a, b]\n\n2. [a, a, a, a]\n\n3. [b, a, a, b]\n\nThen, the entire output is created by processing each input row in sequence and appending their three output rows. Since the input has three rows, each producing three output rows, the output has 3*3=9 rows.\n\nLet's test this with Example 1:\n\nInput rows:\n\n[2,0] \u2192 output rows:\n\nRow1: [0,2,2,0]\n\nRow2: [2,2,2,2]\n\nRow3: [0,2,2,0]\n\nNext input row [2,2], so a=2, b=2.\n\nRow4: [2,2,2,2]\n\nRow5: [2,2,2,2]\n\nRow6: [2,2,2,2]\n\nThird input row [2,0], same as the first.\n\nSo the output is three groups of three rows each. Which matches the given output.\n\nAnother example: Example 2's input is [0,0], [0,5], [5,0].\n\nProcessing first input row [0,0]:\n\nRow1: [0,0,0,0]\n\nRow2: [0,0,0,0]\n\nRow3: [0,0,0,0]\n\nSecond input row [0,5]:\n\nRow4: [5,0,0,5]\n\nRow5: [0,0,0,0]\n\nRow6: [5,0,0,5]\n\nThird input row [5,0]:\n\nRow7: [0,5,5,0]\n\nRow8: [5,5,5,5]\n\nRow9: [0,5,5,0]\n\nWait, but the output given in Example 2 is:\n\n[0,5,5,0]\n\n[5,0,0,5]\n\n[0,0,0,0]\n\n[0,0,0,0]\n\n[5,0,0,5]\n\n[0,5,5,0]\n\n[0,5,5,0]\n\n[5,0,0,5]\n\n[0,0,0,0]\n\nHmm, this doesn't align with the previous pattern. Wait, maybe I made a mistake here.\n\nWait, according to the input of Example 2: the third input row is [5,0]. So a=5, b=0. Then according to the pattern, the three rows would be:\n\nRow7: [0,5,5,0]\n\nRow8: [5,5,5,5]\n\nRow9: [0,5,5,0]\n\nBut in the actual output of Example 2, the rows are:\n\nRow1: [0,5,5,0]\n\nRow2: [5,0,0,5]\n\nRow3: [0,0,0,0]\n\nRow4: [0,0,0,0]\n\nRow5: [5,0,0,5]\n\nRow6: [0,5,5,0]\n\nRow7: [0,5,5,0]\n\nRow8: [5,0,0,5]\n\nRow9: [0,0,0,0]\n\nWait, that doesn't fit the previous pattern. So maybe my initial assumption is wrong.\n\nLet me re-examine Example 2's input and output.\n\nInput rows:\n\n[0,0], [0,5], [5,0]\n\nProcessing each input row as per the previous pattern:\n\nFirst input row [0,0] \u2192 a=0, b=0.\n\nRow1: [0,0,0,0] (since b=0, a=0)\n\nRow2: [0,0,0,0]\n\nRow3: [0,0,0,0]\n\nSecond input row [0,5] \u2192 a=0, b=5.\n\nRow4: [5,0,0,5]\n\nRow5: [0,0,0,0]\n\nRow6: [5,0,0,5]\n\nThird input row [5,0] \u2192 a=5, b=0.\n\nRow7: [0,5,5,0]\n\nRow8: [5,5,5,5]\n\nRow9: [0,5,5,0]\n\nBut the actual output of Example 2 is:\n\n[0,5,5,0]\n\n[5,0,0,5]\n\n[0,0,0,0]\n\n[0,0,0,0]\n\n[5,0,0,5]\n\n[0,5,5,0]\n\n[0,5,5,0]\n\n[5,0,0,5]\n\n[0,0,0,0]\n\nSo the first three rows of the output don't match the initial pattern. The first three rows are:\n\n0,5,5,0\n\n5,0,0,5\n\n0,0,0,0\n\nBut according to the initial pattern, the first three rows should be from the first input row [0,0], which would produce three rows of [0,0,0,0]. But in the output, the first row is [0,5,5,0]. That's different. So my initial theory must be wrong.\n\nHmm, so I need to rethink.\n\nAlternative approach: Maybe the output is constructed by some kind of reflection or tiling of the input matrix.\n\nLooking at the input as a 3x2 matrix, and the output as a 9x4 matrix. Let's see dimensions. The output is 3 times the input rows (3*3=9) and 2 times the columns (2*2=4). So perhaps each element in the input is transformed into a 3x2 block in the output. Wait, but 3x2 input would expand to 9x4 (each row repeated thrice, each element doubled?), but not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the input is arranged in a certain way, like each row is mirrored and repeated. Let's look at Example 0's input:\n\nInput:\n\nRow0: [0,8]\n\nRow1: [0,0]\n\nRow2: [0,8]\n\nOutput:\n\nEach input row is converted into three output rows. Let's see the output for Example 0:\n\nThe first three output rows are:\n\n[8,0,0,8]\n\n[0,0,0,0]\n\n[8,0,0,8]\n\nThen the next three rows are the same as the first three, and then again. Wait, but the input has three rows, and the output has 9 rows. So each input row is generating three rows. But how?\n\nLooking at the first input row [0,8], the first three output rows are [8,0,0,8], [0,0,0,0], [8,0,0,8]. Then the next three rows correspond to the second input row [0,0], which would produce three rows of [0,0,0,0], [0,0,0,0], [0,0,0,0]. Then the third input row [0,8] again produces the same three rows as the first. But in the actual output, the structure is:\n\n8,0,0,8\n\n0,0,0,0\n\n8,0,0,8\n\n8,0,0,8\n\n0,0,0,0\n\n8,0,0,8\n\n8,0,0,8\n\n0,0,0,0\n\n8,0,0,8\n\nWait, that's three groups of three rows each. Each group corresponds to an input row. But in Example 0, all three input rows except the middle are [0,8], but the output groups are all the same. So the first, third, fifth, seventh, ninth rows are all [8,0,0,8], but the output is arranged as three groups of three rows each. Wait, no, the output is:\n\nGroup1 (rows1-3): first input row \u2192 [8,0,0,8], [0,0,0,0], [8,0,0,8]\n\nGroup2 (rows4-6): second input row \u2192 same pattern. But the second input row is [0,0], so the three rows would be [0,0,0,0], [0,0,0,0], [0,0,0,0]. But in the output, group2 is:\n\n[8,0,0,8], [0,0,0,0], [8,0,0,8]\n\nWait, that can't be. So perhaps the initial assumption is wrong.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by mirroring each row of the input in some way and then stacking them with modifications.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the pattern is that each input row is converted into three rows in the output by arranging the elements in a certain way, possibly combining with other rows.\n\nLooking at Example 2's input and output:\n\nInput:\n\n[0,0]\n\n[0,5]\n\n[5,0]\n\nOutput:\n\n[0,5,5,0]\n\n[5,0,0,5]\n\n[0,0,0,0]\n\n[0,0,0,0]\n\n[5,0,0,5]\n\n[0,5,5,0]\n\n[0,5,5,0]\n\n[5,0,0,5]\n\n[0,0,0,0]\n\nHmm. The output starts with [0,5,5,0], which seems like the reverse of the second input row [0,5] followed by the reverse of the third input row [5,0]. Wait, [0,5] reversed is [5,0], and [5,0] reversed is [0,5]. So combining those gives [5,0,0,5], but the first output row is [0,5,5,0], which doesn't match.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each output row is generated from the input rows in a more complex way. For example, each output row is a combination of two input rows.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is a 3x3 grid of 3x4 blocks? Not sure.\n\nWait, let's count the output rows for each example. All examples have 9 rows. The input is always 3 rows, each with 2 elements. So each input row is converted into 3 output rows. So each input row's elements are used to generate 3 output rows, and each output row has 4 elements, which is twice the input's 2 elements. So perhaps each element is expanded into two elements in some pattern.\n\nLooking at the first output row of Example 0: [8,0,0,8]. The input row was [0,8]. So 8 and 0 are in the output. It seems like the output row is created by taking the elements of the input row in reverse order, then original order again. So [0,8] becomes [8,0, 0,8], which is reverse followed by original. Similarly, in Example 1, [2,0] becomes [0,2, 2,0], which is reverse followed by original. So each input row [a, b] becomes [b, a, a, b], which is the first and third rows of each group. The middle row is [a, a, a, a] if the input row is [a, b], but wait, in Example 0, the input row is [0,8], so a=0, b=8. The middle row is [0,0,0,0], which is a's. In Example 1, the input row [2,0] (a=2, b=0) has a middle row of [2,2,2,2], which is a's. Similarly, the third example's input row [0,5] (a=0, b=5) would have a middle row of [0,0,0,0]. \n\nSo the pattern for each input row [a, b] is:\n\nRow 1: [b, a, a, b]\n\nRow 2: [a, a, a, a]\n\nRow 3: [b, a, a, b]\n\nSo each input row generates three rows in the output. Then, the entire output is the concatenation of these three rows for each input row. For example, in Example 0, which has three input rows, each generating three output rows, leading to 9 rows total.\n\nBut wait, in Example 2, the input rows are [0,0], [0,5], [5,0]. Let's process each:\n\nFirst input row [0,0] \u2192 a=0, b=0:\n\nRow1: [0,0,0,0]\n\nRow2: [0,0,0,0]\n\nRow3: [0,0,0,0]\n\nSecond input row [0,5] \u2192 a=0, b=5:\n\nRow4: [5,0,0,5]\n\nRow5: [0,0,0,0]\n\nRow6: [5,0,0,5]\n\nThird input row [5,0] \u2192 a=5, b=0:\n\nRow7: [0,5,5,0]\n\nRow8: [5,5,5,5]\n\nRow9: [0,5,5,0]\n\nBut the actual output for Example 2 is:\n\n[0,5,5,0]\n\n[5,0,0,5]\n\n[0,0,0,0]\n\n[0,0,0,0]\n\n[5,0,0,5]\n\n[0,5,5,0]\n\n[0,5,5,0]\n\n[5,0,0,5]\n\n[0,0,0,0]\n\nHmm, this doesn't align with the previous pattern. According to the pattern, the first three rows should be all zeros from the first input row. But in the actual output, the first row is [0,5,5,0], which corresponds to the third input row. So there's a discrepancy here. Therefore, the previous pattern must be incorrect.\n\nAlternative approach: Maybe the output is a 3x3 grid where each cell is a transformation of the input elements, but arranged in a larger grid. Alternatively, perhaps the output is generated by rotating or reflecting the input in some way.\n\nLooking at Example 2's output:\n\nRow1: [0,5,5,0] \u2192 this is the third input row [5,0] transformed into [0,5,5,0], but according to the earlier pattern.\n\nRow2: [5,0,0,5] \u2192 this is the second input row [0,5] transformed into [5,0,0,5].\n\nRow3: [0,0,0,0] \u2192 perhaps from the first input row.\n\nBut then the next rows repeat this pattern. Wait, perhaps the output is arranged as a 3x3 grid of blocks, each block being generated from the corresponding input row in a rotated or transformed manner.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is generated by combining each input row with the next one. For example, in Example 2, the input rows are [0,0], [0,5], [5,0]. The output starts with a combination of the second and third input rows. But this is speculative.\n\nAlternative idea: The output is formed by taking each element in the input and creating a 3x2 block in the output. But 3 rows input and 9 rows output (3x3) and 2 columns input to 4 columns output (2x2). So each element is expanded into a 3x2 block. But how?\n\nAlternatively, the output could be a reflection of the input in some way. For example, mirroring each row and then stacking them vertically with modifications.\n\nWait, let's look at Example 1's output:\n\nThe output starts with [0,2,2,0], which is [b,a,a,b] where the input row is [2,0]. Then the next row is [2,2,2,2], which is a's. Then again [0,2,2,0]. Then this repeats for each input row. So the output for each input row is three rows: [b,a,a,b], [a,a,a,a], [b,a,a,b]. Then the entire output is concatenated. But in Example 2, the actual output doesn't follow this.\n\nWait, Example 2's output:\n\nThe first three rows are [0,5,5,0], [5,0,0,5], [0,0,0,0]. Which doesn't fit the previous pattern. Because according to the earlier pattern, the first input row [0,0] should produce three rows of [0,0,0,0], but here the first row is [0,5,5,0]. So that suggests that the pattern is more complex.\n\nAlternative approach: Maybe the output is generated by combining the input rows in a certain order, possibly with transformations, and repeating them. For example, in Example 0, the output seems to repeat the pattern from the first input row three times, then the middle input row's pattern once, and so on. But this is unclear.\n\nAnother idea: Looking at the output of Example 0, the first three rows are:\n\n[8,0,0,8]\n\n[0,0,0,0]\n\n[8,0,0,8]\n\nThen the next three are the same as the first three. Then the last three are again the same. So perhaps each input row is generating three copies of its own three-row block. But how does that apply to the other examples?\n\nIn Example 1, the input is three rows: [2,0], [2,2], [2,0]. The output is three repetitions of:\n\n[0,2,2,0]\n\n[2,2,2,2]\n\n[0,2,2,0]\n\nWhich would correspond to the first input row [2,0] and third input row [2,0] producing the same blocks, and the middle row [2,2] producing [2,2,2,2] in the middle row. But in the output, the entire structure repeats three times, but the input has three rows. So maybe the output is each input row's three-row block, repeated three times in total.\n\nWait, that can't be. Example 0's input has three rows, but the output has nine rows. So each input row's three-row block appears three times in the output? But that would be 3 input rows \u00d7 3 rows each \u00d7 3 times = 27 rows, which is not the case. So no.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by applying the transformation to each input row and then concatenating all the transformed rows. So for each input row, we generate three output rows, and the output is the concatenation of these for each row. For example, three input rows, each generating three output rows, leading to 9 rows. That makes sense.\n\nIn Example 0, the three input rows generate three groups of three rows each. Each group is:\n\nFor input row [0,8] \u2192 [8,0,0,8], [0,0,0,0], [8,0,0,8]\n\nFor input row [0,0] \u2192 [0,0,0,0], [0,0,0,0], [0,0,0,0]\n\nFor input row [0,8] \u2192 same as the first group.\n\nSo the output is the concatenation of these three groups, leading to 9 rows.\n\nBut in Example 2's output, the first three rows correspond to the third input row [5,0], then the second input row [0,5], then the first input row [0,0]. Or is there another pattern?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by processing the input rows in reverse order. Let's check Example 2:\n\nInput rows:\n\n1. [0,0]\n\n2. [0,5]\n\n3. [5,0]\n\nOutput rows:\n\n1. [0,5,5,0] \u2192 this would be from the third input row [5,0], transformed as [0,5,5,0] (b,a,a,b). So third input row comes first.\n\nOutput row 2: [5,0,0,5] \u2192 this would be from the second input row [0,5], transformed as [5,0,0,5] (b,a,a,b). \n\nOutput row 3: [0,0,0,0] \u2192 from the first input row [0,0], transformed to [0,0,0,0].\n\nThen output rows 4-6 are the same as rows 1-3, and rows 7-9 are again rows 1-3. No, looking at Example 2's output, rows 4-6 are:\n\n[0,0,0,0]\n\n[5,0,0,5]\n\n[0,5,5,0]\n\nHmm, this doesn't fit. So perhaps the processing order is different.\n\nAlternative approach: Let's look for a pattern in the output columns. Each output row has four elements. For Example 0, the first row is [8,0,0,8]. The first and fourth elements are 8, and the middle two are 0. This looks like a mirror of the input elements. For input [0,8], the output row is [8,0,0,8], which is 8 followed by 0, then 0 followed by 8. So it's like the input elements are reversed and then concatenated with themselves reversed again. Or maybe the output row is created by taking the input row's elements in reverse order and then appending their reverse again. So [0,8] reversed is [8,0], then again [0,8], but concatenated gives [8,0,0,8]. Wait, no. [8,0] followed by [0,8] would be [8,0,0,8], which matches. So yes, each output row for [a,b] is created by concatenating the reversed input and the original input. So reversed([a,b]) is [b,a], then original is [a,b], so concatenated gives [b,a,a,b]. So that's the first and third rows.\n\nThe middle row of each three-row group is [a,a,a,a]. So for input row [a,b], the three output rows are:\n\n[b,a,a,b]\n\n[a,a,a,a]\n\n[b,a,a,b]\n\nThis works for Examples 0 and 1.\n\nNow, let's check Example 2's input. The third input row is [5,0], so a=5, b=0. The three rows would be:\n\nRow1: [0,5,5,0]\n\nRow2: [5,5,5,5]\n\nRow3: [0,5,5,0]\n\nBut according to Example 2's output, the first three rows are:\n\n[0,5,5,0], [5,0,0,5], [0,0,0,0]\n\nThis doesn't fit. So what's going on here?\n\nWait, perhaps the processing is not based on each input row individually but involves combining adjacent rows.\n\nLooking at Example 2's input:\n\nRow1: [0,0]\n\nRow2: [0,5]\n\nRow3: [5,0]\n\nThe output's first three rows are:\n\n[0,5,5,0] \u2192 which could be formed from Row3 [5,0] \u2192 [0,5,5,0]\n\n[5,0,0,5] \u2192 from Row2 [0,5] \u2192 [5,0,0,5]\n\n[0,0,0,0] \u2192 from Row1 [0,0] \u2192 [0,0,0,0]\n\nThen the next three rows are [0,0,0,0], [5,0,0,5], [0,5,5,0], which is the same as the first three but in reverse order. Then the last three rows are [0,5,5,0], [5,0,0,5], [0,0,0,0]. So the pattern is cycling through the input rows in reverse order and generating their three-row groups, but this is getting complicated.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by processing the input rows in reverse order and then applying the same three-row transformation. For Example 2, the input rows are [0,0], [0,5], [5,0]. If we reverse the order of the input rows, we get [5,0], [0,5], [0,0]. Processing each in reverse order:\n\nFirst input row in reversed list: [5,0] \u2192 three rows [0,5,5,0], [5,5,5,5], [0,5,5,0]\n\nSecond input row: [0,5] \u2192 [5,0,0,5], [0,0,0,0], [5,0,0,5]\n\nThird input row: [0,0] \u2192 [0,0,0,0], [0,0,0,0], [0,0,0,0]\n\nBut the output of Example 2 is:\n\n[0,5,5,0]\n\n[5,0,0,5]\n\n[0,0,0,0]\n\n[0,0,0,0]\n\n[5,0,0,5]\n\n[0,5,5,0]\n\n[0,5,5,0]\n\n[5,0,0,5]\n\n[0,0,0,0]\n\nSo the first three rows correspond to the third input row [5,0], second input row [0,5], and first input row [0,0], each generating their three rows. But in the actual output, each input row's three-row group is interleaved. This seems inconsistent.\n\nI'm stuck. Let me try another angle. Let's look at the test input and see if I can find a pattern that fits.\n\nTest input:\n\n[3,3]\n\n[3,0]\n\n[3,3]\n\nAccording to the previous pattern, each input row would generate three rows:\n\nFor [3,3], a=3, b=3:\n\nRow1: [3,3,3,3]\n\nRow2: [3,3,3,3]\n\nRow3: [3,3,3,3]\n\nFor [3,0], a=3, b=0:\n\nRow4: [0,3,3,0]\n\nRow5: [3,3,3,3]\n\nRow6: [0,3,3,0]\n\nFor [3,3], same as first.\n\nSo the output would be three groups:\n\nGroup1: [3,3,3,3] three times.\n\nGroup2: [0,3,3,0], [3,3,3,3], [0,3,3,0]\n\nGroup3: [3,3,3,3] three times.\n\nSo the entire output would be:\n\n[3,3,3,3]\n\n[3,3,3,3]\n\n[3,3,3,3]\n\n[0,3,3,0]\n\n[3,3,3,3]\n\n[0,3,3,0]\n\n[3,3,3,3]\n\n[3,3,3,3]\n\n[3,3,3,3]\n\nBut looking at the training examples, especially Example 0 and Example 1, the middle input row affects the middle group. For Example 1, the middle input row is [2,2], which produces three rows of [2,2,2,2]. In Example 0, the middle input row is [0,0], which produces three rows of zeros. So applying this to the test input, which has middle row [3,0], the middle group would be [0,3,3,0], [3,3,3,3], [0,3,3,0]. Then the first and third groups would be three rows of [3,3,3,3] each. So the output would be:\n\nRow1-3: [3,3,3,3] each.\n\nRow4-6: [0,3,3,0], [3,3,3,3], [0,3,3,0]\n\nRow7-9: [3,3,3,3] each.\n\nBut let's see how this compares to the training examples. For Example 1, the input is [2,0], [2,2], [2,0]. The output is three groups: each group for the first and third input row is [0,2,2,0], [2,2,2,2], [0,2,2,0], and the middle group for [2,2] is [2,2,2,2] three times. So the output is:\n\n[0,2,2,0]\n\n[2,2,2,2]\n\n[0,2,2,0]\n\n[0,2,2,0]\n\n[2,2,2,2]\n\n[0,2,2,0]\n\n[0,2,2,0]\n\n[2,2,2,2]\n\n[0,2,2,0]\n\nWhich matches the given output. So the pattern holds for Example 1.\n\nFor Example 2, the input is [0,0], [0,5], [5,0]. The output groups would be:\n\nGroup1 (row1-3): [0,0,0,0] three times.\n\nGroup2 (row4-6): [5,0,0,5], [0,0,0,0], [5,0,0,5]\n\nGroup3 (row7-9): [0,5,5,0], [5,5,5,5], [0,5,5,0]\n\nBut the actual output is:\n\n[0,5,5,0]\n\n[5,0,0,5]\n\n[0,0,0,0]\n\n[0,0,0,0]\n\n[5,0,0,5]\n\n[0,5,5,0]\n\n[0,5,5,0]\n\n[5,0,0,5]\n\n[0,0,0,0]\n\nThis doesn't match the previous pattern. So why is Example 2 different?\n\nWait, in Example 2, the third input row is [5,0], which would generate:\n\n[0,5,5,0]\n\n[5,5,5,5]\n\n[0,5,5,0]\n\nBut the actual output for the third group is [0,5,5,0], [5,0,0,5], [0,0,0,0]. So this doesn't fit.\n\nSo there must be a different pattern here. Perhaps the order in which the input rows are processed is different. For Example 2, the first group in the output corresponds to the third input row, the second group to the second input row, and the third group to the first input row. But why?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the processing order is reversed. Let's see:\n\nExample 2's input rows are:\n\n1. [0,0]\n\n2. [0,5]\n\n3. [5,0]\n\nIf we reverse the order of processing the input rows, we get:\n\n3. [5,0]\n\n2. [0,5]\n\n1. [0,0]\n\nThen, group1 would be processing the third input row [5,0]:\n\n[0,5,5,0], [5,5,5,5], [0,5,5,0]\n\nGroup2 would be processing the second input row [0,5]:\n\n[5,0,0,5], [0,0,0,0], [5,0,0,5]\n\nGroup3 would be processing the first input row [0,0]:\n\n[0,0,0,0], [0,0,0,0], [0,0,0,0]\n\nSo the output would be:\n\nGroup1:\n\nRow1: [0,5,5,0]\n\nRow2: [5,5,5,5]\n\nRow3: [0,5,5,0]\n\nGroup2:\n\nRow4: [5,0,0,5]\n\nRow5: [0,0,0,0]\n\nRow6: [5,0,0,5]\n\nGroup3:\n\nRow7-9: [0,0,0,0] each.\n\nBut the actual output for Example 2 is different. So this doesn't fit either.\n\nHmm, maybe there's an additional rule where the first and third input rows are treated as a pair and mirrored in some way.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is generated by arranging the input rows in a certain pattern, such as rotating them or interleaving them.\n\nAnother observation: The outputs of Examples 0 and 1 have the same structure where each group of three rows is generated by their corresponding input row. Example 2 seems to have a different structure, perhaps due to the input rows being different in a certain way.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the middle row of the input determines a different transformation. For example, in Example 0, the middle input row is [0,0], which is all a's, and in Example 1, the middle row is [2,2], which is also all a's. In Example 2, the middle row is [0,5], which has different a and b.\n\nLooking at Example 2's output, the middle group (rows4-6) are:\n\n[0,0,0,0]\n\n[5,0,0,5]\n\n[0,5,5,0]\n\nThis doesn't fit the previous pattern. So perhaps there's a different rule when the input row is not uniform (a != b).\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation depends on the position of the input row. For example, the first and third input rows are processed one way, and the middle row is processed another way.\n\nBut this doesn't seem to fit either.\n\nAnother idea: Looking at the output of Example 2, the first three rows are [0,5,5,0], [5,0,0,5], [0,0,0,0]. This could be the result of combining the second and third input rows. For instance:\n\nRow1: third input row [5,0] \u2192 [0,5,5,0]\n\nRow2: second input row [0,5] \u2192 [5,0,0,5]\n\nRow3: first input row [0,0] \u2192 [0,0,0,0]\n\nThen rows4-6 are the same as rows1-3 but in reverse order? Not exactly. Row4 is [0,0,0,0], row5 [5,0,0,5], row6 [0,5,5,0]. Which is reverse order. Then rows7-9 are again rows1-3.\n\nBut this is speculative and doesn't provide a clear pattern.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and the need to find a solution, perhaps I should focus on the pattern that works for Examples 0 and 1 and see if it can be applied to the test input, even if Example 2 is an exception. But Example 2 must fit the same pattern, so there's likely a different angle.\n\nWait, perhaps the output is generated by taking each input row and creating three rows in the output, but the middle row is [a, b, b, a]. For example, in Example 2's input row [0,5], a=0, b=5. The middle row would be [0,5,5,0], but in the output, the middle row for that group is [5,0,0,5]. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, the middle row for each input row is [b, a, a, b]. No, because in Example 0's input row [0,8], the middle row is [0,0,0,0].\n\nThis is getting too confusing. Let's try to find a pattern that works for all examples.\n\nLet me look at each input row and its corresponding output rows:\n\nFor Example 0:\n\nInput row [0,8] \u2192 output rows: [8,0,0,8], [0,0,0,0], [8,0,0,8]\n\nInput row [0,0] \u2192 output rows: [0,0,0,0], [0,0,0,0], [0,0,0,0]\n\nInput row [0,8] \u2192 same as first.\n\nFor Example 1:\n\nInput row [2,0] \u2192 output rows: [0,2,2,0], [2,2,2,2], [0,2,2,0]\n\nInput row [2,2] \u2192 output rows: [2,2,2,2] \u00d73\n\nInput row [2,0] \u2192 same as first.\n\nFor Example 2:\n\nInput row [0,0] \u2192 output rows: [0,0,0,0], [0,0,0,0], [0,0,0,0]\n\nInput row [0,5] \u2192 output rows: [5,0,0,5], [0,0,0,0], [5,0,0,5]\n\nInput row [5,0] \u2192 output rows: [0,5,5,0], [5,5,5,5], [0,5,5,0]\n\nBut according to Example 2's output, the first three rows are [0,5,5,0], [5,0,0,5], [0,0,0,0]. Which seems to be from the third, second, and first input rows, respectively. So perhaps the input rows are processed in reverse order. Then, each input row's three rows are generated as before. For Example 2:\n\nProcess third input row [5,0] \u2192 [0,5,5,0], [5,5,5,5], [0,5,5,0]\n\nProcess second input row [0,5] \u2192 [5,0,0,5], [0,0,0,0], [5,0,0,5]\n\nProcess first input row [0,0] \u2192 [0,0,0,0], [0,0,0,0], [0,0,0,0]\n\nBut the output in Example 2 is:\n\n[0,5,5,0]\n\n[5,0,0,5]\n\n[0,0,0,0]\n\n[0,0,0,0]\n\n[5,0,0,5]\n\n[0,5,5,0]\n\n[0,5,5,0]\n\n[5,0,0,5]\n\n[0,0,0,0]\n\nSo the first three rows are the third input row's first output row, second input row's first output row, first input row's first output row. Then the next three are the third input row's second output row, second input row's second output row, first input row's second output row. Then the last three are third input row's third output row, second input row's third output row, first input row's third output row. So it's a vertical interleaving of the three output groups.\n\nBut this is getting too complicated, and I'm not seeing a clear pattern.\n\nPerhaps the correct approach is to accept that each input row generates three output rows: first and third are [b,a,a,b], middle is [a,a,a,a]. The entire output is the concatenation of these three rows for each input row in order.\n\nFor the test input:\n\n[3,3] \u2192 a=3, b=3.\n\nSo each input row [3,3] would generate:\n\n[3,3,3,3], [3,3,3,3], [3,3,3,3]\n\nThe middle input row is [3,0] \u2192 a=3, b=0.\n\nSo its three output rows are [0,3,3,0], [3,3,3,3], [0,3,3,0]\n\nThe third input row is [3,3], same as the first.\n\nSo the output would be:\n\nFirst input row's three rows:\n\n[3,3,3,3]\n\n[3,3,3,3]\n\n[3,3,3,3]\n\nSecond input row's three rows:\n\n[0,3,3,0]\n\n[3,3,3,3]\n\n[0,3,3,0]\n\nThird input row's three rows:\n\n[3,3,3,3]\n\n[3,3,3,3]\n\n[3,3,3,3]\n\nSo the entire output is:\n\n[3,3,3,3]\n\n[3,3,3,3]\n\n[3,3,3,3]\n\n[0,3,3,0]\n\n[3,3,3,3]\n\n[0,3,3,0]\n\n[3,3,3,3]\n\n[3,3,3,3]\n\n[3,3,3,3]\n\nBut looking at the training examples, especially Example 0 and 1, this seems to fit. However, Example 2's output doesn't fit this pattern, which suggests that there's a different pattern for when input rows are non-uniform. But given that the test input's middle row is [3,0], which has different a and b, and the other rows are [3,3], which have a = b, perhaps this pattern is correct.\n\nSo the final answer should follow this pattern."
