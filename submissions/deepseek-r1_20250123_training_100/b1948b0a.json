        "cot_1": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. So, looking at the training examples, the inputs are lists of numbers, mostly 6s and 7s. The outputs also have 2s, 7s, and sometimes 6s. Hmm. Let's start by comparing the input and output of each example.\n\nTake Example 0. The input has three lists. The first input is [6,6,7,6], and the output is [2,2,7,2]. So each 6 turned into a 2, except when there's a 7. Wait, but in the input, the 7s in the third position stayed as 7 in the output. So maybe the 7s are kept, and 6s are converted to 2s. But wait, in the second input list of Example 0: [6,6,7,7] becomes [2,2,7,7]. That fits the same idea\u2014replace 6s with 2s, leave 7s as is. But then the third input list [7,7,6,7] becomes [7,7,2,7]. Again, 6\u21922, 7 stays. So maybe the pattern is: replace all 6s with 2s, keep 7s as 7. But wait, in the outputs of some examples, like Example 1, the output has 2s and 7s. Let's check.\n\nExample 1's input has 6s and 7s, and the output replaces 6s with 2s. Like the first input [7,7,7,6] becomes [7,7,7,2]. Yep. So maybe that's the rule. But wait, looking at Example 2's input and output. The first input list is [7,7,6,6,6,6], which becomes [7,7,2,2,2,2]. So again, 6\u21922. So why in the test input would there be a different pattern?\n\nWait, but all the outputs in the examples only have 2s and 7s. So the transformation is replacing 6s with 2s and leaving 7s as they are. But wait, why in Example 0's output, the third element in the first list is 7 (input was 7) and in the third list's third element, input 6 becomes 2. So maybe that's the case.\n\nBut wait, maybe there's more to it. Let's check if there's any position-dependent transformation. For instance, maybe certain positions are replaced. Let's look at Example 2's second input list: [6,7,6,7,7,7] becomes [2,7,2,7,7,7]. So again, 6\u21922. Third list input [7,6,7,7,6,7] \u2192 [7,2,7,7,2,7]. So same as before. So maybe the pattern is indeed simply replace all 6s with 2s and leave 7s as is.\n\nBut let's test that hypothesis. Let's take Example 0's input:\n\nInput:\n[6,6,7,6] \u2192 [2,2,7,2] (all 6s replaced by 2)\n[6,6,7,7] \u2192 [2,2,7,7]\n[7,7,6,7] \u2192 [7,7,2,7]\n\nYes, that seems consistent. Then in Example 1's input:\n\nFirst input [7,7,7,6] \u2192 [7,7,7,2] (6 becomes 2)\nSecond input [6,6,7,6] \u2192 [2,2,7,2]\nThird [7,7,6,7] \u2192 [7,7,2,7], etc. All 6s become 2s.\n\nSame for Example 2. So the pattern is straightforward: replace every 6 with a 2, leave 7s as they are. Then, the test input would follow the same rule.\n\nSo the test input is:\n\n[6,7,7,6] \u2192 replace 6s with 2: [2,7,7,2]\n[6,7,6,7] \u2192 [2,7,2,7]\n[7,7,7,6] \u2192 [7,7,7,2]\n[7,6,7,6] \u2192 [7,2,7,2]\n\nSo the output should be these transformed lists. Let me check each of the test input lists.\n\nFirst test input list: [6,7,7,6] \u2192 [2,7,7,2]. Yep.\n\nSecond: [6,7,6,7] \u2192 [2,7,2,7]\n\nThird: [7,7,7,6] \u2192 [7,7,7,2]\n\nFourth: [7,6,7,6] \u2192 [7,2,7,2]\n\nThat matches the pattern observed in the training examples. So the answer should be the test input with all 6s replaced by 2s and 7s left as is.",

        "cot_2": "Okay, let's tackle this puzzle. So, the task is to figure out the pattern that transforms the input lists into the output lists. Let's look at the training examples carefully.\n\nStarting with Example 0. The input has three lists, each containing 6s and 7s. The output replaces some 6s with 2s. Let me see:\n\nInput 0:\n[6,6,7,6] \u2192 Output [2,2,7,2]\n[6,6,7,7] \u2192 [2,2,7,7]\n[7,7,6,7] \u2192 [7,7,2,7]\n\nHmm. It looks like in each list, the 6s that are not adjacent to a 7 (maybe?) get replaced by 2. Wait, but in the first list, all 6s are replaced. Let's check their positions. Wait, maybe it's about the position of the 6s. Alternatively, perhaps the 6s that are either first or last in their row are replaced. Wait, no. Let's see the first input row: [6,6,7,6]. The output replaces all 6s with 2. The second row [6,6,7,7] \u2192 the first two 6s are replaced, but the last two 7s stay. Third row [7,7,6,7] \u2192 the 6 is replaced by 2. Wait, maybe all 6s except those that are adjacent to a 7 in some way. Or perhaps the 6s that are not followed or preceded by a 7. Hmm, maybe that's not it. Let's check another example.\n\nExample 1's input and output:\n\nInput row 1: [6,6,7,6] \u2192 [2,2,7,2]\nInput row 3: [7,6,7,7] \u2192 [7,2,7,7]\nSo here, the 6 in the second position is replaced by 2. In that row, the 6 is between 7 and 7. So adjacent to 7s. So maybe the rule is that any 6 that is not part of a consecutive sequence? Or perhaps all 6s are replaced by 2 except when they are adjacent to a 7? Wait, but in the first example's second row, [6,6,7,7] \u2192 [2,2,7,7], so the 6s that are next to 7s (third element is 7) get replaced. Wait, perhaps the rule is that all 6s are replaced with 2, except when they are followed by a 7. No, in the first example's third row, the 6 is followed by a 7 (the element after is 7) but it's replaced by 2. So that's not it.\n\nWait, maybe the transformation is replacing 6 with 2 unless there's a 7 in the same position in the previous or next row. Let's check Example 0. The input is three rows. Let's look at the first element of each row:\n\nRow 0: 6 \u2192 becomes 2\nRow 1: 6 \u2192 becomes 2\nRow 2:7 \u2192 becomes 7\n\nBut I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the 6s that are in a column where there's a 7 in the same column in another row are replaced. Wait, for example, in Example 0's input:\n\nFirst column: 6,6,7 \u2192 in output, 2,2,7. So the 6s in columns where there's a 7 in another row are replaced. Let's check that. For column 0: all rows have 6,6,7. So the 6s are replaced with 2 except the third row's 7. So maybe if in the same column, there is a 7 in any row, then all 6s in that column are replaced by 2. Because in Example 0, column 0 has a 7 in the third row, so the first two rows' 6s become 2. Let's check another column. Column 1 in Example 0's input: 6,6,7. The output is 2,2,7. Again, same logic. Column 2: 7,7,6. The third row's 6 is in a column where there's 7s in other rows (rows 0 and 1). So that 6 becomes 2. Column 3: 6,7,7. The first row's 6 is in a column where there are 7s in other rows (rows 1 and 2). So the 6 becomes 2. The second row's 7 stays, third row's 7 stays. \n\nSo this seems like the pattern: For each column, if there is at least one 7 in that column across all rows, then every 6 in that column is replaced by 2. If there are no 7s in the column, then the 6s remain 6. \n\nLet's test this with Example 1. Let's look at the input of Example 1:\n\nThe input has 6 rows. Let's check column 0. Input rows:\n\nRow 0:7, row1:6, row2:7, row3:7, row4:7, row5:6. So column 0 has 7,6,7,7,7,6. There are 7s in this column, so all 6s here should become 2. Let's check the output. In row1 (input 6 in column 0), output is 2. Row5's column 0 is 6 \u2192 2. So that fits.\n\nAnother column: let's take column 3 in Example 1's input. Let's see the input in column 3 across all rows:\n\nRow0:6 \u2192 output 2 (since column 3 has 7s in other rows)\nRow1:6 \u2192 output 2 (since column3 has 7 in row0 (6), row2 has 7, etc. Wait, wait, let's check all rows in Example1's input:\n\nRow0:7,7,7,6 \u2192 column3 is 6.\nRow1:6,6,7,6 \u2192 column3 is 6.\nRow2:7,7,6,7 \u2192 column3 is7.\nRow3:7,6,7,7 \u2192 column3 is7.\nRow4:7,6,7,6 \u2192 column3 is6.\nRow5:6,6,6,7 \u2192 column3 is7.\n\nSo in column3, there are 7s in rows 2,3,5. Therefore, any 6 in column3 should become 2. Let's check the outputs:\n\nRow0's column3:6 \u2192 output 2 (correct).\nRow1's column3:6 \u2192 output2 (correct).\nRow4's column3:6 \u2192 output2 (correct).\nRows2,3,5's column3:7 \u2192 remain 7.\n\nSo this seems to hold. Now Example2:\n\nInput for example2:\n\n[7,7,6,6,6,6]\n[6,7,6,7,7,7]\n[7,6,7,7,6,7]\n\nLooking at each column:\n\nColumn0:7,6,7 \u2192 has 7s. So all 6s in column0 become 2. Input rows:\n\nRow0:7 \u2192 stays 7.\nRow1:6 \u2192 becomes 2.\nRow2:7 \u2192 stays 7.\n\nCheck output:\n\nRow1's first element becomes 2 (as in the output [2,7,2,7,7,7]).\n\nColumn2 in input: 6,6,7. So column2 has a 7 in row2. So all 6s in column2 (rows0 and1) become2. So in output:\n\nRow0's third element (6) \u2192 2.\nRow1's third element (6) \u21922.\nRow2's third element (7) \u21927.\n\nWhich matches the example's output.\n\nSo the pattern seems to be: for each column in the input, if there's at least one 7 in that column, then every 6 in that column is replaced with 2. If a column has no 7s (all 6s), then the 6s stay as 6.\n\nNow let's apply this to the test input.\n\nTest input:\n\n[6,7,7,6]\n[6,7,6,7]\n[7,7,7,6]\n[7,6,7,6]\n\nWe need to process each column:\n\nColumns are 0,1,2,3 (since each row has 4 elements).\n\nLet's check each column:\n\nColumn0:\n\nRows: 6,6,7,7 \u2192 has 7s. So all 6s here become 2. So the elements in column0:\n\nRow0:6 \u21922\nRow1:6 \u21922\nRow2:7 \u21927\nRow3:7 \u21927\n\nColumn1:\n\nElements:7,7,7,6 \u2192 has 7s (rows0-2 are 7). So 6 in row3 becomes 2. So:\n\nRow0:7\u21927\nRow1:7\u21927\nRow2:7\u21927\nRow3:6\u21922\n\nColumn2:\n\nElements:7,6,7,7 \u2192 has 7s (rows0,2,3). So 6 in row1 becomes2:\n\nRow0:7\u21927\nRow1:6\u21922\nRow2:7\u21927\nRow3:7\u21927\n\nColumn3:\n\nElements:6,7,6,6 \u2192 has 7 in row1. So all 6s become2. So:\n\nRow0:6\u21922\nRow1:7\u21927\nRow2:6\u21922\nRow3:6\u21922\n\nPutting this all together, each row becomes:\n\nRow0: [2,7,7,2]\nRow1: [2,7,2,7]\nRow2: [7,7,7,2]\nRow3: [7,2,7,2]\n\nSo the output should be:\n\n[2,7,7,2]\n[2,7,2,7]\n[7,7,7,2]\n[7,2,7,2]"
