        "cot_1": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. So looking at the training examples, the input is a 6x6 grid with some numbers and a lot of zeros, and the output has these blocks of numbers around the edges. Hmm.\n\nStarting with Example 0. The input has 9,3 in the middle and 7,8 below. The output has 8,8 and 7,7 on the top rows, and 3,3 and 9,9 on the bottom. Wait, maybe it's mirroring or flipping some numbers. Like, the 7 and 8 in the input become 8 and 7 in the output? Or swapping positions? Let me check. The original middle part is [9,3] and [7,8]. The output's top left has 8s and the top right has 7s. Then the bottom has 3s and 9s. Maybe the numbers from the middle are being rotated around the grid. \n\nIn Example 1, the input has 4,6 and 2,1 in the upper middle. The output's first row starts with 1, and the fourth row has 6s and 4s. Wait, the output has 1 in the first row, which might correspond to the 1 in the input's third row. Then the 4 and 6 from the input's second row are still there, but the output's fourth and fifth rows have 6,0,0,4,4. So maybe the numbers are moving to the outer edges in some rotational way. Like, numbers from the middle layers are being moved to the perimeter, possibly mirrored or swapped.\n\nAnother observation: in Example 0's output, the top left 8s and the bottom left 3s. The original middle numbers were 9,3 and 7,8. The 8 from the middle row (7,8) is on the top, and 3 from the middle (9,3) is on the bottom. Similarly, the 7 from the middle (7,8) is on the top right, and 9 from the middle (9,3) is on the bottom right. So maybe each quadrant is getting the numbers from the adjacent middle cells. Like, top left gets the number from the cell below it in the middle, and top right gets the number from the cell to the left? Or something like that.\n\nLooking at Example 2: input has 3,6 and 5,2. The output's top left is 2,2 and top right 5,5. The bottom rows have 6,6 and 3,3. The middle cells are 3,6 and 5,2. So the 2 from the bottom middle (5,2) is on the top left, and 5 is on the top right. The 6 from the middle (3,6) is on the bottom left, and 3 is on the bottom right. So it seems like each corner is taking a number from the middle cells. Maybe the numbers are rotated clockwise or counter-clockwise.\n\nWait, maybe the pattern is that the non-zero numbers in the middle are being \"reflected\" outward to the edges. For each non-zero cell in the middle, the surrounding zeros are replaced with that number in a mirrored fashion. But how exactly?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is taking the numbers from the middle 2x2 or 2x3 area and copying them to the edges in a specific way. Let me see the positions.\n\nIn Example 0's input, the non-zero cells are in rows 2 and 3 (0-based?), with columns 2 and 3. The output has 8s and 7s on the top two rows, and 3s and 9s on the bottom two. Wait, maybe the numbers from the middle rows are being moved to the top and bottom, mirrored. Let's see:\n\nOriginal middle rows (third and fourth rows, assuming 0-based or 1-based? Let's check indices. Assuming rows are 0-5. So in Example 0 input:\n\nRow 2: [0, 0, 9, 3, 0, 0]\nRow 3: [0, 0, 7, 8, 0, 0]\n\nOutput's top two rows have 8,8 and 7,7. Hmm, 8 is from row3 column3, 7 from row3 column2. Then the bottom rows have 3 and 9, which are from row2 columns3 and 2. So maybe the numbers from row3 are placed on the top rows, and numbers from row2 are placed on the bottom rows, but mirrored. Like, for row3's 7 and 8, the top rows get 8 and 7 in their respective sides. And row2's 9 and 3 become 3 and 9 on the bottom rows. So flipping the order.\n\nWait, row3 has [7,8], and the top rows in the output have 8,8 and 7,7. So maybe for each cell in row3, the value is placed on the top rows in the same column but mirrored. For example, 7 in row3 column2 (0-based) would be mirrored to the top left, and 8 in column3 to the top right. Then similarly, row2's 9 and 3 would go to the bottom rows, but swapped. So 9 in row2 column2 becomes 3 in the bottom left, and 3 in row2 column3 becomes 9 in the bottom right? That might make sense.\n\nLet me check Example 2. Input's row2: [0, 0, 3, 6, 0, 0], row3: [0, 0,5,2,0,0]. So row3 has 5 and 2. The output's top rows have 2,2 and 5,5. So 2 and 5 from row3 are placed on the top, but in reverse order (since row3's row is 5,2, the output top has 2 and 5). Then row2's 3 and 6 are placed on the bottom rows as 6,6 and 3,3. Again, reversed. So the numbers from row3 are reversed and placed on the top, and row2's numbers are reversed and placed on the bottom.\n\nSo the pattern seems to be:\n\nTake the non-zero elements from the middle two rows (rows 2 and 3, assuming 0-based indexing). For row3, take the non-zero elements (like 7,8 in Example 0), reverse their order (8,7), and place them in the top two rows, each in their respective columns as a block. Similarly, take row2's non-zero elements (9,3 in Example 0), reverse them (3,9), and place them in the bottom two rows. Additionally, the numbers are duplicated in pairs, forming blocks of two.\n\nWait, in Example 0's output, the top two rows have [8,8,0,0,7,7]. So for row3's 7 and 8, reversed to 8,7. Then each number is repeated twice. So 8 becomes 8,8 in columns 0-1, and 7 becomes 7,7 in columns 4-5. Similarly, row2's 9 and 3 reversed to 3,9, placed in the bottom two rows as 3,3 and 9,9.\n\nSimilarly, Example 2: row3 has 5,2 reversed to 2,5. So top rows have 2,2 and 5,5. Row2's 3,6 reversed to 6,3, so bottom rows have 6,6 and 3,3.\n\nThis seems consistent. Now for Example 1, let's check. Input's row2 is [0,2,1,0,0,0], row3 is all zeros except for row1? Wait, the input in Example1's input is:\n\nRow 1: [0,4,6,0,0,0]\n\nRow 2: [0,2,1,0,0,0]\n\nRow3: all zeros.\n\nSo row3 is zeros. Then how does the output get generated? The output has [1,0,0,2,2,0] in the first row. Then rows 4 and 5 have [6,0,0,4,4,0] and [6,0,0,4,4,0]. Wait, perhaps the non-zero elements in row1 and row2 are considered here. Because row3 is all zeros, maybe the pattern looks for the first non-zero rows above and below the center?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the middle is considered as rows 2 and 3, but in Example1, the non-zero elements are in rows 1 and 2. But the output's top rows are 1 and 2. Wait, the first row of output is [1,0,0,2,2,0]. So the 1 comes from row2's column2 (value 1), and 2 comes from row2's column1 (value 2). Reversed, 2,1 would become 1,2. But the output top row has 1 followed by 2,2. Hmm, maybe it's different when the middle rows are not in the center.\n\nWait, maybe the pattern is that the middle two rows (rows 2 and 3) are considered as the source. If row3 is all zeros, then perhaps only row2 is considered. Let's see. In Example1's input, row2 has [0,2,1,0,0,0]. The non-zero elements are 2 and 1. Reversed, they become 1 and 2. So placing them on the top rows. But the output's first row has 1 and 2,2. Wait, the output's first row is [1,0,0,2,2,0]. So the 1 is in the first column, and 2s are in columns 3 and 4. Maybe the numbers from the middle rows are split into left and right parts.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the numbers are placed in the top and bottom rows based on their positions. For example, if the middle rows have numbers, then their left and right parts are mirrored to the top and bottom.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the process is:\n\n1. Identify all non-zero numbers in the input grid.\n\n2. For each non-zero number in the middle rows (rows 2 and 3?), determine their positions and mirror them to the outer rows (rows 0-1 and 4-5) in a specific way.\n\nBut how exactly?\n\nIn Example0, the non-zero numbers are in rows 2 and 3. The output's top rows (0 and 1) have 8 and 7, which come from row3's 7 and 8. Wait, row3 has 7 and 8, but in the output's top rows, they are 8 and 7. So reversed order. Similarly, row2's 9 and 3 become 3 and 9 in the bottom rows.\n\nSo perhaps, the numbers from row3 are reversed and placed in the top rows, and numbers from row2 are reversed and placed in the bottom rows. Each number is duplicated into two columns.\n\nIn Example0:\n\nRow3: 7,8 \u2192 reversed to 8,7. Then in the top rows, each is duplicated in two columns: 8,8 and 7,7. So top rows become [8,8,0,0,7,7].\n\nRow2:9,3 \u2192 reversed to 3,9 \u2192 placed in bottom rows as [3,3,0,0,9,9].\n\nSimilarly, in Example2:\n\nRow3:5,2 \u2192 reversed to 2,5 \u2192 top rows [2,2,0,0,5,5].\n\nRow2:3,6 \u2192 reversed to6,3 \u2192 bottom rows [6,6,0,0,3,3].\n\nIn Example1:\n\nThe input's row3 is all zeros. So row2 has 2 and 1. Reversed to 1,2. Then placed in the top rows. So the top rows would have [1,1,0,0,2,2]. But in the output, the first row is [1,0,0,2,2,0]. Hmm, this doesn't fit. Wait, maybe in Example1, the middle rows are row1 and row2? Because the non-zero numbers are in row1 (4,6) and row2 (2,1). Then maybe row1 and row2 are considered as the middle rows for that case. But that complicates the pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the middle rows are determined by where the non-zero elements are. For Example1, the non-zero elements are in row1 and row2, so the middle is around there. But how would that affect the output?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the algorithm is as follows:\n\n- For each pair of rows (row i and row 5 - i), look for non-zero elements. Then mirror those elements to their respective outer rows.\n\nBut that might not fit.\n\nAnother approach: The output seems to create blocks of duplicated numbers in the outer rows (0-1 and 4-5). The numbers in these blocks correspond to the non-zero numbers in the middle rows (rows 2 and 3), but reversed. For example, if row3 has a pair of numbers, they are reversed and each number is duplicated twice in the top rows. Similarly, row2's numbers are reversed and placed in the bottom rows.\n\nBut in Example1, the non-zero numbers are in row1 and row2. So maybe row1 and row2 are treated as the middle rows. But that's inconsistent with the other examples where the middle is rows2 and3. This is confusing.\n\nWait, let's check the positions in Example1's output. The non-zero numbers in the output are in the first row (1 and 2), rows4 and5 (6 and4). The input's non-zero numbers were in row1 (4,6), row2 (2,1). So the output has 1 (from row2's 1) in the first row, and 2 (from row2's 2) also in the first row. Then 6 and4 (from row1's 4 and6) in rows4 and5. So perhaps the numbers from row2 are reversed (1,2) and placed in the top rows, and numbers from row1 are reversed (6,4) and placed in the bottom rows. But in Example1's output, the top row is [1,0,0,2,2,0], which has 1 in column0 and 2s in columns3 and4. The bottom rows have 6s in column0 and 4s in columns3 and4. \n\nSo perhaps, the numbers from row2 (2,1) are reversed to 1,2. Then each is placed in the top rows. 1 is placed in the leftmost possible columns, and 2 in the right. Similarly, row1's 4,6 reversed to6,4, placed in the bottom rows. So 6s on the left, 4s on the right.\n\nBut why in Example1's top row, 1 is in column0 and 2s start at column3. So perhaps the numbers are placed as far left and right as possible. For example, a pair of numbers would take the first two columns (left) and the last two columns (right). But how?\n\nAlternatively, the left block is the first two columns, and the right block is the last two columns. For numbers in the middle, they are split into left and right. So for example, in Example0, the numbers from row3 (7 and8) are reversed to 8,7. So 8 goes to left (columns0-1) and 7 to right (columns4-5). Similarly, row2's numbers 9,3 reversed to3,9. 3 to left, 9 to right in the bottom rows.\n\nIn Example1, row2's numbers are 2 and1 (columns1 and2). Reversed to1,2. Then 1 is placed in the left (columns0-1) but in the output, it's only column0. Hmm, maybe if there's only one number, it's duplicated in two columns. Wait, but in Example1's output, the first row has 1 in column0, but column1 is 0. Then columns3-4 have 2s. So maybe the left block is columns0-1 and the right block is columns3-4 (since the grid is 6 columns). Wait, 0-1, 2-3, 4-5? So maybe each pair of columns is considered as a block.\n\nAlternatively, the left and right blocks are each two columns. For example, left two columns (0,1) and right two columns (4,5). Middle two columns (2,3) are ignored (as they have the original numbers). Then, the numbers from the middle rows are split into left and right parts. For example, row3's left number (column2) and right number (column3) are taken, reversed, and placed in the top left and right blocks. Similarly, row2's numbers are reversed and placed in the bottom left and right blocks.\n\nWait, in Example0's input, row3 has 7 (column2) and8 (column3). Reversed to 8,7. So 8 is placed in the top left block (columns0-1) as 8,8. 7 is placed in top right block (columns4-5) as7,7. Similarly, row2 has9 (column2) and3 (column3). Reversed to3,9. 3 in bottom left block, 9 in bottom right.\n\nYes, that seems to fit. So the pattern is:\n\n- For the top two rows (0 and1), take the non-zero elements from row3's columns2 and3, reverse their order, and place them as blocks in columns0-1 (left) and4-5 (right) of the top two rows. Each number is duplicated in both columns of the block.\n\n- For the bottom two rows (4 and5), take the non-zero elements from row2's columns2 and3, reverse their order, and place them in the left and right blocks of the bottom two rows.\n\nIf there are no non-zero elements in row3, then the top rows remain as zeros. Similarly for row2.\n\nLet's test this with Example1. The input's row3 is all zeros. So the top rows would remain zeros, but looking at Example1's output, the top row has 1 and2. Oh, but the input's row2 (which is row2 in 0-based) has columns1 and2 with 2 and1. Wait, but according to the previous pattern, row2's columns2 and3 are considered. In Example1's input, row2 is [0,2,1,0,0,0]. Columns2 and3 are 1 and0. So perhaps if the columns2 and3 are not both non-zero, then look for the first two non-zero numbers in the row. Alternatively, maybe it's columns2 and3 regardless of zeros. In Example1's row3, columns2 and3 are zeros, so top rows would be zeros. But in the output, the top row has 1 and2. This suggests that the pattern is not exactly as before.\n\nHmm. Let's think again. Maybe the non-zero numbers in rows2 and3 are considered, regardless of their columns, and their positions are mirrored. Alternatively, maybe the numbers are taken from the middle two columns (columns2 and3) of the middle two rows (rows2 and3). \n\nIn Example0 and Example2, the non-zero numbers are in columns2 and3. So that's consistent. But in Example1, the non-zero numbers are in columns1 and2 of row1 and row2. So perhaps the pattern is to take the first two non-zero numbers in rows2 and3 (if any), regardless of their columns, reverse them, and place them in the top and bottom rows. But that's a stretch.\n\nAlternatively, the pattern is to take the numbers from the cells (2,2), (2,3), (3,2), (3,3) (assuming 0-based indices), which form a 2x2 square in the center. Then, for the top rows, take the bottom row (row3) of this square, reverse the order, and place them in the top left and right blocks. For the bottom rows, take the top row (row2) of this square, reverse the order, and place them in the bottom left and right blocks.\n\nIn Example0:\n\nCenter square:\nRow2:9,3\nRow3:7,8\n\nTop rows get row3 reversed (8,7) \u2192 left block 8,8 and right block7,7.\nBottom rows get row2 reversed (3,9) \u2192 left block3,3 and right block9,9.\n\nIn Example2:\n\nCenter square:\nRow2:3,6\nRow3:5,2\n\nTop rows: row3 reversed (2,5) \u2192 left2,2; right5,5.\nBottom rows: row2 reversed (6,3) \u2192 left6,6; right3,3.\n\nIn Example1:\n\nThe center square (cells (2,2), (2,3), (3,2), (3,3)) are:\nRow2:1,0 (columns2 and3)\nRow3:0,0 (columns2 and3)\n\nSo row3 has 0s, so top rows remain zeros. But in the output, the top row has 1 and 2. That's conflicting. So maybe the center square is not the case. Alternatively, the pattern is more flexible. For Example1, perhaps the numbers from row1 and row2 are considered. But then how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the pattern involves taking the non-zero elements from the entire middle two rows (rows2 and3), regardless of columns, reverse their order, and distribute them to the top and bottom. For Example0, row2 has [9,3], row3 has [7,8]. Combined, they are 9,3,7,8. Reversed would be8,7,3,9. But how this leads to the output is unclear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the numbers in the middle are \"reflected\" outward. Each non-zero number in the middle is mirrored to the corresponding outer rows. For example, a number in row3, column x is mirrored to row0 and1, column x. But the examples don't support this directly.\n\nWait, looking at Example0's output:\n\nRow0 and1 have 8s in columns0-1 and7s in4-5. The original row3 has7 and8 in columns2-3. So perhaps 7 is mirrored to the right side (columns4-5) and 8 to the left (columns0-1). Similarly, row2's 9 and3 are mirrored to the bottom rows:9 to the right and3 to the left. But mirrored how? Like, 7 and8 in row3 are placed in the top rows, swapped left and right. So 8 (from row3 column3) is placed on the left of the top rows, and7 (row3 column2) on the right.\n\nWait, in row3, columns2 and3 have7 and8. In the top rows, they are placed in columns0-1 (8s) and4-5 (7s). So it's like moving them to the edges, reversed. So column3's8 goes to left, column2's7 goes to right. Then row2's9 and3 (columns2 and3) are moved to bottom rows, reversed: column2's9 goes to right (columns4-5) and column3's3 goes to left (columns0-1).\n\nSo the pattern could be:\n\nFor each middle row (rows2 and3):\n\n- For row3, take the two non-zero numbers in columns2 and3. Reverse their order and place them in the top rows (0 and1) as blocks in the left (columns0-1) and right (columns4-5) sides.\n\n- For row2, take the two non-zero numbers in columns2 and3. Reverse their order and place them in the bottom rows (4 and5) as blocks in the left and right sides.\n\nIf there are no numbers in those positions, then leave zeros.\n\nSo applying this to the test input:\n\nTest Input:\n\n[0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\n[0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\n[0,0,0,0,0,0] \u2192 row2\n\n[0,0,3,1,0,0] \u2192 row3\n\n[0,0,2,5,0,0] \u2192 row4\n\n[0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nWait, wait, the test input's rows are:\n\nRow0: all zeros\n\nRow1: all zeros\n\nRow2: all zeros\n\nRow3: [0,0,3,1,0,0]\n\nRow4: [0,0,2,5,0,0]\n\nRow5: all zeros.\n\nSo according to the pattern, the middle rows would be row3 and row4? Or rows2 and3? Hmm, the previous examples used rows2 and3 (0-based) as the middle. But in this test input, the non-zero numbers are in rows3 and4. Wait, the input's rows are 0-based. So row3 is the fourth row. But in the training examples, the non-zero numbers were in rows2 and3. So perhaps the pattern is to look at rows2 and3 (third and fourth in 1-based, but 2 and3 in 0-based) regardless of where the numbers are. \n\nBut in the test input, rows2 and3 are:\n\nRow2: [0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow3: [0,0,3,1,0,0]\n\nSo row2 is all zeros. So according to the pattern, the bottom rows (4 and5) would take the reversed numbers from row2, which are zeros. But in the test input's row3, we have 3 and1 in columns2 and3. So for the top rows, reversed 1 and3 \u2192 1,3. Then top rows would have 1 in left and3 in right. But wait, the previous pattern was to take row3's numbers (columns2 and3), reverse them, and place them in the top rows. \n\nWait, the test input's row3 (third row in 0-based) has [0,0,3,1,0,0]. So columns2 and3 are3 and1. Reversed order is1,3. So top rows (0 and1) would have 1s in columns0-1 and3s in4-5. \n\nBut row2 (0-based) is all zeros. So the bottom rows (4 and5) would take reversed numbers from row2's columns2 and3 (which are 0 and0), so nothing. But the test input's row4 has [0,0,2,5,0,0]. But according to the previous pattern, the bottom rows are determined by row2's columns2 and3. But here row4 is not part of the middle rows (rows2 and3). So this may complicate things.\n\nWait, this is conflicting. Because in the training examples, the non-zero numbers are in rows2 and3 (0-based). But in the test input, the non-zero numbers are in rows3 and4. So perhaps the pattern is different.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the pattern is to look for the first two consecutive rows that contain non-zero numbers and use those as the middle rows. In the test input, rows3 and4 have non-zero elements. So row3 has 3 and1, row4 has2 and5. So perhaps in this case, row3 and row4 are considered as the middle rows. Then the top rows would take row4's numbers (2 and5), reversed to5,2. Place 5s in the left and2s in the right of the top rows. And the bottom rows would take row3's numbers (3 and1) reversed to1,3. Place 1s in the left and3s in the right of the bottom rows.\n\nBut this would change the pattern from the training examples. Hmm, but how else to explain it.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the middle rows are the two rows that are closest to the center. For a 6-row grid, rows2 and3 are the center. So regardless of where the non-zero numbers are, the middle rows are rows2 and3. So in the test input, rows2 is all zeros, row3 has3 and1. Then the top rows would take row3's numbers reversed (1,3), and the bottom rows take row2's numbers (all zeros). But then the output's bottom rows would be zeros. But row4 of the test input has2 and5. So perhaps the pattern is different.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Let's try to re-express the pattern from the training examples again.\n\nIn all training examples, the non-zero numbers in the input are located in rows2 and3 (0-based). For example:\n\nExample0: rows2 and3 have numbers.\n\nExample1: rows1 and2 have numbers, but output's top rows take numbers from row2 (reversed 1,2) and bottom rows from row1 (reversed6,4). So perhaps the pattern is that the middle rows are the first pair of rows that contain non-zero numbers, and then their numbers are reversed and placed in the top and bottom.\n\nBut this would require dynamically selecting the middle rows. For Example0 and2, the middle rows are 2 and3. For Example1, the middle rows are1 and2. Then, for the test input, the middle rows would be3 and4, since rows3 and4 have non-zero numbers.\n\nSo the pattern could be:\n\n- Find the first pair of consecutive rows (starting from the top) where both rows have at least two non-zero numbers in columns2 and3. Then, take those two rows as the middle rows.\n\nBut in Example1, row1 has non-zero numbers in columns1 and2, not 2 and3.\n\nAlternatively, the middle rows are rows2 and3, regardless of their content. Even if they are zeros, like in Example1's row3. Then, for the output:\n\nTop rows (0 and1) take the reversed numbers from row3's columns2 and3.\n\nBottom rows (4 and5) take the reversed numbers from row2's columns2 and3.\n\nBut in Example1's row3, columns2 and3 are zeros. So top rows remain zeros. However, in Example1's output, the top row has1 and2. So this doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. Maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let's try to think of the test input's case.\n\nTest Input:\n\nRows0-2: all zeros.\n\nRow3: [0,0,3,1,0,0] \u2192 columns2 and3 are3 and1.\n\nRow4: [0,0,2,5,0,0] \u2192 columns2 and3 are2 and5.\n\nRow5: zeros.\n\nAssuming that the middle rows are rows3 and4 (since they have non-zero numbers), then:\n\nTop rows (0 and1) take row4's columns2 and3 numbers (2,5) reversed to5,2. So top rows would have5s on the left (columns0-1) and2s on the right (4-5).\n\nBottom rows (4 and5) take row3's columns2 and3 numbers (3,1) reversed to1,3. So bottom rows have1s on the left and3s on the right.\n\nBut the output would be:\n\n[5,5,0,0,2,2]\n\n[5,5,0,0,2,2]\n\n[0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\n[0,0,3,1,0,0]\n\n[1,1,0,0,3,3]\n\n[1,1,0,0,3,3]\n\nBut wait, the original rows3 and4 are part of the input, so they should remain in the output as well. Looking at the training examples, the middle rows (rows2 and3) are present in the output. So the output's middle rows are the same as the input's. Only the top and bottom rows are modified.\n\nIn the test input, the middle rows (rows3 and4) would remain, and the top and bottom rows (0-1 and4-5) are generated based on rows3 and4.\n\nWait, but in the training examples, rows4 and5 are part of the output's bottom rows, which were generated. For example, in Example0, the input's rows4 and5 are zeros, and the output's rows4 and5 are filled with3s and9s.\n\nBut the test input's rows4 and5: row4 is part of the middle rows (if rows3 and4 are considered), so they need to remain in the output. But according to the training examples, the middle rows are part of the output. So in Example0, the input's rows2 and3 are in the output. Similarly, in the test input, rows3 and4 would be part of the output. Then, the top rows (0-1) are generated from row4's numbers, and bottom rows (5-6, but it's a 6-row grid) would be generated from row3's numbers.\n\nWait, rows are 0-5. So rows4 and5 are the fifth and sixth rows. If the middle rows are rows3 and4 (0-based), then the bottom rows to fill are rows5 (but there's no row6). So perhaps this approach isn't correct.\n\nAlternatively, the pattern is that the output's middle rows are the same as the input's, and the top and bottom rows are derived from the middle rows. But which middle rows?\n\nIn the training examples:\n\n- Example0: input's rows2 and3 are the middle rows, output leaves them as is.\n\n- Example1: input's rows1 and2 have non-zero elements. Output leaves them as is (rows1 and2 in output are same as input), but the top and bottom rows are generated from row2 and row1's numbers.\n\nSo the pattern might be: the middle rows in the input are preserved in the output, and the top and bottom rows are generated based on the middle rows. The middle rows are the ones that have the non-zero numbers. So for each middle row, the numbers are used to generate the outer rows.\n\nFor the test input:\n\nMiddle rows are rows3 and4 (since they have non-zero numbers). So they are preserved in the output. The top rows (0-1) are generated from row4's numbers (2 and5), reversed to5,2. So top rows are 5s and2s. The bottom rows (5-4?) No, in a 6-row grid, the bottom rows are 4 and5. But in the test input, row4 is a middle row (preserved), so the bottom rows to generate would be rows4 and5. But row4 is already part of the input's middle rows. This is confusing.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the test input's middle rows are rows3 and4. So the top rows are generated from row4's numbers, and the bottom rows from row3's numbers. So row4's 2 and5 become5 and2, placed in the top rows. Row3's3 and1 become1 and3, placed in the bottom rows. \n\nThus, the output would have:\n\nTop rows 0-1:\n\n[5,5,0,0,2,2]\n\n[5,5,0,0,2,2]\n\nMiddle rows 3-4 (preserved):\n\n[0,0,3,1,0,0]\n\n[0,0,2,5,0,0]\n\nBottom rows 4-5 (generated from row3's numbers1,3):\n\n[1,1,0,0,3,3]\n\n[1,1,0,0,3,3]\n\nWait, but row4 is already part of the input and is preserved. So the generated bottom rows would be rows4 and5, but row4 is already filled with [0,0,2,5,0,0]. So this would overwrite it. That can't be right.\n\nThis suggests that perhaps the pattern isn't about the middle rows being preserved, but rather about the output's middle rows being the same as the input's. But how?\n\nAlternatively, the middle rows (rows2 and3 in training examples) are preserved, and the top and bottom rows are generated from rows3 and2, respectively. For the test input, if the middle rows are rows2 and3 (even though row2 is zero), then the top rows are generated from row3's numbers (3,1 \u2192 reversed1,3 \u2192 top rows [1,1,0,0,3,3] twice), and the bottom rows from row2's numbers (zeros \u2192 bottom rows remain zero). But the test input's row4 has numbers. So this doesn't fit.\n\nThis is getting too confusing. Maybe I should look for a different approach.\n\nAnother observation: in all the training examples, the output's top rows and bottom rows have their numbers mirrored in pairs. Like, the first two columns are the same, and the last two are the same. So each block is two columns wide.\n\nIn Example1, the output's first row is [1,0,0,2,2,0], which isn't exactly two columns, but the 2s are in columns3 and4. Maybe the pattern is that each generated block is two columns, but in cases where the number is placed in a different position, like example1's 1 is in column0, and the 2s start at column3.\n\nAlternatively, the generated numbers are placed in the first two columns (left) and the last two columns (right). For example, in Example0's top rows, 8s are in columns0-1 (left) and7s in4-5 (right). So maybe the non-zero numbers from row3's columns2-3 are reversed and placed in the left and right blocks of the top rows.\n\nSimilarly, row2's numbers are reversed and placed in the left and right blocks of the bottom rows.\n\nSo for the test input:\n\nRow3's columns2-3:3,1 \u2192 reversed to1,3 \u2192 top rows would have1s in left (0-1) and3s in right (4-5).\n\nRow4's columns2-3:2,5 \u2192 reversed to5,2 \u2192 but row4 is not part of the middle rows. So if the middle rows are rows3 and4, then row4's numbers are used for the top rows. But in the training examples, the middle rows were rows2 and3.\n\nThis is getting really tricky. Given the time I have, I think the safest bet is to apply the pattern observed in the training examples, assuming that the middle rows are rows2 and3 (0-based), and if they have non-zero numbers, their reversed numbers are placed in the top and bottom rows.\n\nIn the test input:\n\nRow2 (0-based) is all zeros. Row3 has3 and1 in columns2 and3.\n\nSo according to the pattern:\n\nTop rows (0-1) take row3's numbers reversed (1,3) \u2192 left block1,1 and right block3,3.\n\nBottom rows (4-5) take row2's numbers (which are zeros) \u2192 left and right blocks remain zero.\n\nThus, the output's middle rows (2-3) are preserved as per the input. Wait, but in the input, row2 is all zeros, so the output's row2 would remain zeros. But the test input's row3 is [0,0,3,1,0,0], row4 is [0,0,2,5,0,0].\n\nBut according to the pattern from the training examples, only rows2 and3 are considered. So row3's numbers3 and1 would be reversed to1 and3, placed in top rows as1s and3s. But row2 is all zeros, so the bottom rows would have zeros.\n\nSo the output would look like:\n\nTop two rows:\n\n[1,1,0,0,3,3]\n\n[1,1,0,0,3,3]\n\nMiddle rows (rows2-3):\n\n[0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\n[0,0,3,1,0,0]\n\nRow4 of input is [0,0,2,5,0,0], which is preserved in the output?\n\nWait, no, in the training examples, the output's middle rows are the same as the input's. So rows2 and3 in the output are same as input's rows2 and3. Rows4 and5 are generated based on row2's numbers. But in the test input, row2 is all zeros, so rows4 and5 would be zeros. But the test input's row4 is [0,0,2,5,0,0], which is not in the middle rows (assuming middle rows are 2 and3). So how does this row4 fit into the output?\n\n This is confusing. The input's row4 is not part of the middle rows (rows2 and3), so it would be preserved as is in the output. So the output's row4 is the same as the input's row4: [0,0,2,5,0,0]. But according to the pattern, the bottom rows (4 and5) are generated based on row2's numbers (zeros), so they would be zeros. But the input's row4 is not part of the generated rows. So this contradicts.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output's middle rows are the same as the input's, and the generated rows are only the top and bottom two rows, which are replaced. The other rows are preserved.\n\nWait, looking at the training examples:\n\nIn Example0's input, rows0-1 and4-5 are zeros. Output's rows0-1 and4-5 are filled with numbers, while rows2-3 are same as input.\n\nIn Example1's input, row0 is zero, row1-2 have numbers, row3-5 are zeros. Output's row0 is filled, rows1-2 same as input, rows3-4 filled, row5 same as input (zero).\n\nSo it seems that the generated rows are:\n\n- Top two rows (0-1) are generated based on row3's numbers.\n\n- Bottom two rows (4-5) are generated based on row2's numbers.\n\nOther rows are preserved.\n\nSo regardless of where the non-zero numbers are in the input, the output's rows0-1 and4-5 are generated from row3 and row2's columns2-3, respectively.\n\nSo in the test input:\n\nRow3: columns2-3 are3 and1 \u2192 reversed to1,3 \u2192 top rows0-1: [1,1,0,0,3,3] each.\n\nRow2: columns2-3 are0 and0 \u2192 bottom rows4-5: [0,0,0,0,0,0].\n\nOther rows are preserved. But the input's row4 has [0,0,2,5,0,0]. So in the output, row4 would be preserved as is. But according to the pattern, rows4-5 are generated from row2's numbers (zeros), so they would be zeros, overwriting the input's row4. This is conflicting.\n\nBut in the training examples, the input's rows4-5 were zeros, and they were replaced with generated numbers. So perhaps the pattern is that the top two rows (0-1) and bottom two rows (4-5) are always replaced, regardless of the input's content. So even if row4 of the input has numbers, they are overwritten by the generated numbers from row2's columns2-3.\n\nThus, for the test input:\n\nTop two rows (0-1) are generated from row3's columns2-3 (3,1 \u2192 reversed1,3 \u2192 left and right blocks).\n\nBottom two rows (4-5) are generated from row2's columns2-3 (0,0 \u2192 zeros).\n\nOther rows (2-3 and row4-5) are preserved.\n\nBut the input's row4 is [0,0,2,5,0,0], so according to this, the output's row4 would be generated as zeros, overwriting the input's row4. But that's not possible because the pattern in the training examples shows that the middle rows (rows2-3) are preserved, and the generated rows are 0-1 and4-5. So in the test input, rows2-3 are preserved, row4 is part of the generated rows (4-5) which would be zeros. So the input's row4 is overwritten.\n\nBut that doesn't make sense. So maybe the pattern is:\n\n- Rows0-1: generated from row3's columns2-3.\n\n- Rows4-5: generated from row2's columns2-3.\n\n- Rows2-3: preserved as per input.\n\n- Other rows (like row4 in the test input) are not part of the preserved rows. So row4 is overwritten.\n\nBut in the test input's case, row4 is not part of the preserved rows. So according to this, the generated rows4-5 would be zeros, overwriting the input's row4 and5. But in the training examples, the input's rows4-5 were zeros and were overwritten.\n\nThis seems to fit. So applying this to the test input:\n\nGenerated rows0-1:\n\nRow3's columns2-3:3,1 \u2192 reversed to1,3 \u2192 rows0-1 become [1,1,0,0,3,3] each.\n\nPreserved rows2-3: rows2 is [0,0,0,0,0,0], row3 is [0,0,3,1,0,0].\n\nGenerated rows4-5: row2's columns2-3 are0,0 \u2192 rows4-5 are [0,0,0,0,0,0] each.\n\nSo the test input's row4 ([0,0,2,5,0,0]) would be replaced with zeros. But this seems incorrect. But according to the pattern, rows4-5 are generated based on row2's columns2-3. So they are replaced.\n\nBut this would lead to:\n\n[1,1,0,0,3,3]\n\n[1,1,0,0,3,3]\n\n[0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\n[0,0,3,1,0,0]\n\n[0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\n[0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nBut the test input's row4 has2 and5, which are not present in the output. This suggests that this approach is incorrect.\n\nHmm. Maybe the pattern is different. Let's look at the test input again.\n\nTest Input's rows3 and4 have non-zero numbers. Maybe the middle rows are now rows3 and4. So:\n\nTop rows0-1: generated from row4's columns2-3 (2,5 \u2192 reversed5,2 \u2192 left5,5 and right2,2).\n\nBottom rows4-5: generated from row3's columns2-3 (3,1 \u2192 reversed1,3 \u2192 left1,1 and right3,3).\n\nBut this would require the middle rows to be rows3 and4. But how does this fit with the training examples?\n\nIn Example0, rows2 and3 are the middle rows. Top rows are generated from row3's numbers, bottom rows from row2's.\n\nIn Example1, rows1 and2 are the middle rows. Top rows generated from row2's numbers, bottom rows from row1's.\n\nSo perhaps the middle rows are the first pair of consecutive rows (starting from the top) that have non-zero numbers in columns2-3. For the test input, the first such pair is rows3 and4. So:\n\nTop rows0-1 generated from row4's columns2-3 (2,5 \u2192 reversed5,2 \u2192 left5,5 and right2,2).\n\nBottom rows4-5 generated from row3's columns2-3 (3,1 \u2192 reversed1,3 \u2192 left1,1 and right3,3).\n\nThe middle rows (3 and4) are preserved.\n\nSo the output would be:\n\n[5,5,0,0,2,2]\n\n[5,5,0,0,2,2]\n\n[0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\n[0,0,3,1,0,0]\n\n[0,0,2,5,0,0] \u2192 preserved.\n\n[1,1,0,0,3,3]\n\n[1,1,0,0,3,3]\n\nWait, but the grid is 6 rows. So rows0-5. So the bottom rows are4 and5. So the generated rows4 and5 would replace the input's row4 and5. But the input's row4 has [0,0,2,5,0,0], which would be replaced with [1,1,0,0,3,3] in row4 and5. So the output's row4 would be [1,1,0,0,3,3], and row5 also the same. But the input's row4 is part of the middle rows (rows3 and4), so it's preserved. But according to this approach, only the top and bottom rows are generated, middle rows are preserved.\n\nSo the output would be:\n\nRows0-1: generated from row4's numbers.\n\nRows3-4: preserved.\n\nRows4-5: generated from row3's numbers.\n\nBut this would require row4 to be both preserved and part of the generated rows, which is impossible.\n\nThis is really challenging. Given the time constraints, I think the best approach is to assume that the pattern is to take the middle rows (rows2 and3), generate top rows from row3's columns2-3 reversed, bottom rows from row2's columns2-3 reversed. Even if those rows are zeros.\n\nApplying this to the test input:\n\nRow3's columns2-3:3 and1 \u2192 reversed1,3 \u2192 top rows0-1: [1,1,0,0,3,3] each.\n\nRow2's columns2-3:0 and0 \u2192 bottom rows4-5: zeros.\n\nPreserved rows2-3: input's row2 (zeros) and row3 (3,1).\n\nThus, the output would be:\n\n[1,1,0,0,3,3]\n\n[1,1,0,0,3,3]\n\n[0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\n[0,0,3,1,0,0]\n\n[0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\n[0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nBut this ignores the test input's row4 (2,5). But according to the pattern from training examples, rows4 and5 are generated from row2's numbers (which are zeros here), so they are zeros, overwriting any input there.\n\nHowever, the training examples didn't have this situation, so perhaps the correct answer is as above.",

        "cot_2": "Okay, let's tackle this puzzle. The goal is to figure out the pattern from the training examples and apply it to the test input. Let's start by looking at each example closely.\n\nIn Example 0, the input has two rows in the middle with numbers 9,3 and 7,8. The output has these numbers remaining in the same position. Then, the first two rows of the output have 8s and 7s, and the last two rows have 3s and 9s. Hmm, maybe there's some swapping happening. Let's see: the original numbers in the middle are 9,3 and 7,8. In the output's top part, the numbers are 8,8 and 7,7. The bottom part has 3,3 and 9,9. So it looks like the 9 and 8 are swapped, and the 3 and 7 are swapped? Wait, maybe not exactly. Let me check the positions. The original middle cells are (2,2)=9, (2,3)=3; (3,2)=7, (3,3)=8. In the output, the top left corners (rows 0 and 1, columns 0-1) are 8s. Similarly, the top right (columns 4-5) are 7s. The bottom left (rows 4-5, columns 0-1) are 3s, and bottom right (columns 4-5) are 9s. So maybe the numbers in the middle 2x2 grid (positions (2,2)-(3,3)) are being mirrored or rotated, and their values are being placed in the corners of the output. Let's see:\n\nOriginal middle 2x2:\n9 3\n7 8\n\nIn the output's corners:\nTop-left (8,8) and (8,8) \u2013 perhaps 8 comes from the original 8 in position (3,3). The bottom-right corners are 9,9 which would be from the original 9 in (2,2). Then the 7s in top-right could come from the 7 in (3,2), and the 3s in bottom-left from the 3 in (2,3). So it's like taking the four numbers from the middle 2x2 grid and placing them in the four corners of the output, each in a 2x2 block. The order might be:\n\nOriginal positions (clockwise from top-left corner of the middle 2x2):\n9 (top-left), 3 (top-right), 8 (bottom-right), 7 (bottom-left)\n\nThen in the output, these are placed in the four corners:\n\nTop-left corner (rows 0-1, cols 0-1): 8s (from original bottom-right 8)\nTop-right corner (rows 0-1, cols 4-5):7s (from original bottom-left 7)\nBottom-left corner (rows 4-5, cols 0-1):3s (from original top-right 3)\nBottom-right corner (rows 4-5, cols 4-5):9s (from original top-left 9)\n\nSo it's like the middle 2x2 numbers are rotated clockwise 180 degrees and then placed in the four corners, each as 2x2 blocks. Or perhaps each corner takes one number from the middle in a specific way.\n\nLooking at Example 1's input:\n\nMiddle rows have:\nRow 1: 4,6\nRow 2:2,1\n\nBut the output's corners are:\n\nTop-left: 1 (which is from original position (2,3)=1?), but let's check. Wait, in the input, the non-zero numbers are in rows 1 and 2. The output's first row starts with 1, then in the top-right there are 2,2. Then in the bottom-left, rows 4-5 have 6,6 and 6,6 in columns 0-1? Wait, the output for Example 1:\n\nFirst row [1, 0, 0, 2, 2, 0]\n\nSecond row [0,4,6,0,0,0]\n\nThird row [0,2,1,0,0,0]\n\nFourth row [6,0,0,4,4,0]\n\nFifth row [6,0,0,4,4,0]\n\nSo the top-left corner (positions (0,0)) is 1, which might correspond to the original 1 in (2,2). The top-right has 2s, which could be from the original 2 in (2,1). The bottom-left has 6s (from original 6 in (1,2)), and the bottom-right has 4s (from original 4 in (1,1)). Hmm. So in this case, the four numbers in the middle (positions (1,1)=4, (1,2)=6, (2,1)=2, (2,2)=1) are being placed as follows:\n\nTop-left corner: 1 (from (2,2))\nTop-right:2 (from (2,1))\nBottom-left:6 (from (1,2))\nBottom-right:4 (from (1,1))\n\nSo it's like taking the four numbers in a 2x2 block (positions (1,1) to (2,2)) and rotating them 180 degrees. Because:\n\nOriginal 2x2 block:\n\n4 6\n\n2 1\n\nIf rotated 180 degrees, it becomes:\n\n1 2\n\n6 4\n\nThen, each of these numbers is placed in a 2x2 block in the respective corners. So 1 is in the top-left corner (as 2x2 blocks), 2 in top-right, 6 in bottom-left, 4 in bottom-right. So the pattern seems to be:\n\nTake the 2x2 block in the middle (positions vary?), rotate it 180 degrees, and then place each of the four numbers in the four corners, each as a 2x2 block. Wait, but in Example 0, the middle 2x2 is rows 2-3 and columns 2-3. Let me check:\n\nExample 0's middle 2x2:\n\nRow 2: 9,3\n\nRow3:7,8\n\nSo the block is:\n\n9 3\n\n7 8\n\nRotated 180 degrees would be:\n\n8 7\n\n3 9\n\nThen the top-left corner would be 8, top-right 7, bottom-left 3, bottom-right 9. Which matches the output in Example 0: the top-left 8s, top-right 7s, bottom-left 3s, bottom-right 9s. Exactly. So the process is:\n\n1. Identify the 2x2 block in the middle of the input grid. For example, in Example 0, it's rows 2-3, columns 2-3. In Example 1, the 2x2 block is rows 1-2, columns 1-2 (since the non-zero numbers are there). Wait, but in Example 1, the non-zero numbers start at row1, column1. So perhaps the 2x2 block is wherever the non-zero numbers are clustered. Wait, but in Example 0, the middle rows are 2 and 3, but in Example 1, the non-zero block is in rows 1-2, columns1-2. So maybe the 2x2 block is the minimal 2x2 area that contains all non-zero elements. Or perhaps it's the center of the grid.\n\nWait, the input grids are 6x6. The center would be around rows 2-3 and columns 2-3 for a 6x6 grid. But in Example 1, the non-zero elements are in rows1-2, columns1-2. So maybe the 2x2 block is not fixed but based on the positions of the non-zero numbers. Alternatively, maybe the 2x2 block is always centered. Let's check:\n\nIn Example 0, the non-zero elements are in rows2-3 and columns2-3, which is the center. In Example 1, the non-zero elements are in rows1-2 and columns1-2. But the output's top-left corner is 1, which would be from (2,2) in the input. Wait, but in Example 1's input, the (2,2) cell is 1. So in the input, the 2x2 block is (1,1) to (2,2). Rotating that 180 degrees would swap positions. So for the 2x2 block:\n\nOriginal positions (1,1)=4, (1,2)=6\n\n(2,1)=2, (2,2)=1\n\nAfter rotating 180, becomes:\n\n1 (from (2,2)) 2 (from (2,1))\n\n6 (from (1,2)) 4 (from (1,1))\n\nSo the rotated block is:\n\n1 2\n\n6 4\n\nThen, each of these numbers is placed in the four corners as 2x2 blocks. So top-left corner (rows 0-1, cols 0-1) filled with 1, top-right (rows 0-1, cols 4-5) filled with 2, bottom-left (rows4-5, cols0-1) filled with6, bottom-right (rows4-5, cols4-5) filled with4. Which is exactly what's in the output of Example 1.\n\nSo the pattern is:\n\n- Find the 2x2 block of non-zero numbers (possibly the minimal 2x2 that contains all non-zero cells; but looking at examples, perhaps it's the central 2x2 block if there's a 2x2 block of non-zeros in the center. But in Example 1, the non-zero block is not centered. Hmm, this may be conflicting. Wait, in Example 0, the non-zero numbers are in the center 2x2. In Example1, the non-zero numbers are in rows1-2, columns1-2. So perhaps the 2x2 block is wherever the non-zero elements are arranged in a contiguous 2x2 block. Then, rotate that block 180 degrees, and distribute the numbers to the four corners as 2x2 blocks.\n\nLet's check Example2.\n\nInput for Example2:\n\nMiddle rows have:\n\nRow2:3,6\n\nRow3:5,2\n\nSo the 2x2 block is rows2-3, columns2-3 (assuming that's where the numbers are). Rotating 180 gives:\n\n2 (from row3, column3), 5 (from row3, column2)\n\n6 (from row2, column3), 3 (from row2, column2)\n\nSo the rotated block would be:\n\n2 5\n\n6 3\n\nThen, the four numbers are placed in the corners:\n\nTop-left:2, top-right:5, bottom-left:6, bottom-right:3. And in the output, the top-left has 2s, top-right 5s, bottom-left 6s, bottom-right 3s. Which matches the output of Example2.\n\nSo the pattern is:\n\n1. Identify the 2x2 block of non-zero numbers in the input.\n\n2. Rotate this block 180 degrees (i.e., swap elements in a way that (a,b) becomes (opposite positions)).\n\n3. Place each of the four numbers from the rotated block into the four corners of the output grid, each as a 2x2 block. The order is:\n\n- The top-left corner of the output is filled with the top-left element of the rotated block.\n\n- The top-right corner (cols 4-5 in a 6x6 grid) is filled with the top-right element.\n\n- The bottom-left corner (rows4-5, cols0-1) is filled with the bottom-left element.\n\n- The bottom-right corner (rows4-5, cols4-5) is filled with the bottom-right element.\n\nSo for the test input:\n\nTest Input:\n\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n[0, 0, 3, 1, 0, 0]\n\n[0, 0, 2, 5, 0, 0]\n\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nLooking for the non-zero 2x2 block. The non-zero numbers are in rows3-4, columns2-3:\n\nRow3: [0,0,3,1,0,0]\n\nRow4: [0,0,2,5,0,0]\n\nSo the 2x2 block is:\n\n3 1\n\n2 5\n\nRotating this 180 degrees would swap elements such that the new block becomes:\n\n5 (original (4,3)) 2 (original (4,2))\n\n1 (original (3,3)) 3 (original (3,2))\n\nWait, rotating 180 degrees around the center of the 2x2 block. For a 2x2 matrix, rotating 180 degrees is the same as reversing both rows and columns. So the rotated block would be:\n\nOriginal:\n\nRow3:3,1\n\nRow4:2,5\n\nAfter rotating 180:\n\nRow3 becomes row4 reversed, and vice versa. Wait, perhaps the rotated block would be:\n\nOriginal positions (3,2)=3, (3,3)=1\n\n(4,2)=2, (4,3)=5\n\nAfter rotation, the positions would be:\n\n(0,0) becomes (1,1): So original 3,1 becomes 5,2\n\nWait, perhaps rotating 180 degrees the 2x2 matrix:\n\nOriginal matrix:\n\n[ [3, 1],\n  [2, 5] ]\n\nRotating 180 degrees (each element is moved to the position diametrically opposite):\n\nThe rotated matrix would be:\n\n[5, 2]\n\n[1, 3]\n\nWait, no. Rotating 180 degrees is equivalent to flipping the matrix both vertically and horizontally. So first reverse each row, then reverse the order of the rows.\n\nOriginal rows:\n\nRow1:3,1 \u2192 reversed to 1,3\n\nRow2:2,5 \u2192 reversed to5,2\n\nThen reverse the order of the rows. So rows become:\n\n5,2\n\n1,3\n\nWait, that's not right. Let me think again. For a 2x2 matrix, rotating 180 degrees would mean that the element at (0,0) moves to (1,1), (0,1) moves to (1,0), (1,0) moves to (0,1), and (1,1) moves to (0,0). So the rotated matrix would be:\n\nOriginal:\n\na b\n\nc d\n\nAfter 180 rotation:\n\nd c\n\nb a\n\nSo applying this to the test input's 2x2 block:\n\nOriginal:\n\n3 1\n\n2 5\n\nRotated 180 becomes:\n\n5 2\n\n1 3\n\nWait, no. Let's apply the rotation:\n\nThe element at (0,0) (3) moves to (1,1).\n\nThe element at (0,1) (1) moves to (1,0).\n\nThe element at (1,0) (2) moves to (0,1).\n\nThe element at (1,1) (5) moves to (0,0).\n\nWait, that's confusing. Alternatively, rotating 180 degrees for a matrix can be done by reversing each row and then reversing the order of the rows.\n\nOriginal matrix:\n\n3 1\n\n2 5\n\nReverse each row:\n\n1 3\n\n5 2\n\nThen reverse the order of the rows:\n\n5 2\n\n1 3\n\nSo the rotated 180 matrix is:\n\n5 2\n\n1 3\n\nSo the four numbers after rotation are:\n\nTop-left:5, top-right:2\n\nBottom-left:1, bottom-right:3\n\nNow, according to the pattern, these four numbers are placed in the four corners as 2x2 blocks.\n\nTop-left corner (rows0-1, cols0-1) filled with 5s.\n\nTop-right corner (rows0-1, cols4-5) filled with 2s.\n\nBottom-left corner (rows4-5, cols0-1) filled with1s.\n\nBottom-right corner (rows4-5, cols4-5) filled with3s.\n\nThen, the original 2x2 block in the input (3,1;2,5) remains unchanged in the output? Wait, looking at the training examples, the original 2x2 blocks in the input are retained in the output. For example, in Example0, the middle rows still have 9,3 and7,8. Similarly, in Example1, the middle block (4,6 and2,1) is retained. So the rotated block is used to create the corners, but the original numbers stay in place. So the output should have the original 2x2 block in their positions and the corners filled based on the rotated block.\n\nSo applying this to the test input:\n\nThe original 2x2 block (3,1 and2,5) remains in rows3-4, cols2-3.\n\nThe rotated block gives the four corners:\n\nTop-left:5 (from original (4,3)=5) \u2192 fill rows0-1, cols0-1 with5s.\n\nTop-right:2 (from original (4,2)=2) \u2192 fill rows0-1, cols4-5 with2s.\n\nBottom-left:1 (from original (3,3)=1) \u2192 fill rows4-5, cols0-1 with1s.\n\nBottom-right:3 (from original (3,2)=3) \u2192 fill rows4-5, cols4-5 with3s.\n\nWait, but according to the rotation method, the top-left in the rotated block is5 (from the original bottom-right position), so top-left corner is filled with5. The top-right of rotated block is2 (from original bottom-left), so top-right corner has2. Bottom-left of rotated block is1 (original top-right), so bottom-left corner has1. Bottom-right of rotated block is3 (original top-left), so bottom-right corner has3.\n\nSo the output's four corners would be:\n\nTop-left:5,5 (2x2)\n\nTop-right:2,2 (2x2)\n\nBottom-left:1,1 (2x2)\n\nBottom-right:3,3 (2x2)\n\nAnd the original 2x2 block remains in rows3-4, cols2-3.\n\nPutting this together, the test input's output should be:\n\nFirst two rows: [5,5,0,0,2,2] for both rows0 and 1.\n\nThen rows2 is all zeros except maybe the original middle (but in test input, rows2 and3 have non-zeros only in rows3-4, so rows2 is all zeros except in the original block which is rows3-4, cols2-3.\n\nWait, the original 2x2 block is rows3-4, cols2-3. So in the output, that block remains as is. So rows3 and4 would have:\n\nRow3: [0,0,3,1,0,0]\n\nRow4: [0,0,2,5,0,0]\n\nBut in the output, the bottom-left corner (rows4-5, cols0-1) is filled with1s. Wait, no. The bottom-left is rows4-5, cols0-1. So row4 and5, columns0-1 would be filled with1s. But row4 in the input is [0,0,2,5,0,0], so in the output, row4 would be:\n\n[1,1,2,5,0,0]\n\nWait, no. Let me think again. The original 2x2 block is in rows3 and4, columns2 and3. Those positions remain unchanged. The corners are filled with the rotated numbers, but the original numbers stay. So for example, in Example0, the middle 2x2 numbers (9,3 and7,8) are still present in the output. So the test input's rows3 and4, columns2 and3 would remain as 3,1 and2,5.\n\nTherefore, the output would look like:\n\nRows0-1: [5,5,0,0,2,2] each.\n\nRows2: all zeros except maybe the original block, but in the test input, row2 is all zeros.\n\nRow3: [0,0,3,1,0,0]\n\nRow4: [0,0,2,5,0,0]\n\nRow5: [0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nBut wait, the bottom-left corner (rows4-5, cols0-1) should be filled with1s. So row4 and5, cols0-1 would be 1s. However, row4 in the original has non-zero numbers in cols2-3. So the output's row4 would be [1,1,2,5,0,0], and row5 would be [1,1,0,0,0,0]. Wait, but in Example0's output, the bottom-left corner starts at row4, cols0-1. So in the test input, the bottom-left corner would be rows4-5, cols0-1: both rows4 and5, columns0 and1 filled with1s. Similarly, the bottom-right corner (rows4-5, cols4-5) filled with3s.\n\nBut row4 in the original has cols2-3 as 2,5. So the output's row4 would be:\n\ncols0-1:1,1\n\ncols2-3:2,5 (from original)\n\ncols4-5:0,0 (since bottom-right corner is rows4-5, cols4-5 which is 3,3. Wait, no. The bottom-right corner is filled with3s. So row4's cols4-5 would be3s? But in the output structure, the bottom-right corner is rows4-5, cols4-5. So row4 and5, cols4-5 would have3s.\n\nPutting this all together:\n\nRow0: [5,5,0,0,2,2]\n\nRow1: [5,5,0,0,2,2]\n\nRow2: [0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow3: [0,0,3,1,0,0]\n\nRow4: [1,1,2,5,3,3]\n\nRow5: [1,1,0,0,3,3]\n\nWait, but in the original row4, cols2-3 are 2,5. So row4 in the output would be:\n\ncols0-1:1,1\n\ncols2-3:2,5 (original values)\n\ncols4-5:3,3 (from the bottom-right corner)\n\nSo row4 becomes [1,1,2,5,3,3]\n\nRow5's cols0-1:1,1 and cols4-5:3,3, others 0.\n\nSo row5 is [1,1,0,0,3,3]\n\nBut wait, in the training examples, the original 2x2 block remains in their positions. For example, in Example0, the middle 2x2 block is still present. So in the test input, rows3 and4, cols2-3 should remain as 3,1 and2,5. So rows3 and4 are:\n\nRow3: [0,0,3,1,0,0]\n\nRow4: [0,0,2,5,0,0]\n\nBut according to the corners, row4 and5's cols0-1 are 1s, and cols4-5 are3s.\n\nSo row3 remains the same. Row4, which is in the original input [0,0,2,5,0,0], now becomes:\n\ncols0-1:1,1 (from bottom-left corner)\n\ncols2-3:2,5 (original)\n\ncols4-5:3,3 (from bottom-right corner)\n\nSo row4 becomes [1,1,2,5,3,3]\n\nRow5, which was all zeros, becomes [1,1,0,0,3,3]\n\nSimilarly, rows0 and1:\n\ncols0-1:5,5 (top-left)\n\ncols4-5:2,2 (top-right)\n\nSo rows0 and1:\n\n[5,5,0,0,2,2]\n\nRow2 remains all zeros.\n\nRow3 is [0,0,3,1,0,0]\n\nRow4: [1,1,2,5,3,3]\n\nRow5: [1,1,0,0,3,3]\n\nBut let's check the training example outputs again to confirm this structure. For Example0, the original middle rows are present, and the corners are filled with the rotated numbers. So the test input's output should follow that.\n\nThus, the final answer would be:\n\n[5,5,0,0,2,2]\n\n[5,5,0,0,2,2]\n\n[0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\n[0,0,3,1,0,0]\n\n[1,1,2,5,3,3]\n\n[1,1,0,0,3,3]\n\nWait, but in the training examples, the middle block is retained. For example, in Example1, the middle block (rows1-2, cols1-2) remains as 4,6 and2,1. Similarly, in the test input, the middle block (rows3-4, cols2-3) should remain as3,1 and2,5. So row3 is [0,0,3,1,0,0], row4 is [0,0,2,5,0,0], but according to the corners, row4's cols0-1 are1s and cols4-5 are3s. So row4 becomes [1,1,2,5,3,3].\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo the final output for the test input would be as described."
