        "cot_1": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. So, looking at the training examples, the input is one or more arrays, and the output is a series of arrays. Let's start by examining the first example.\n\nExample 0:\nInput has two arrays: [1,2] and [3,8]. The output has four arrays. The first output array is [0,1,2,0]. The second is [1,1,2,2], the third [3,3,8,8], and the fourth [0,3,8,0]. Hmm, how do these relate to the inputs?\n\nLet me see. The first input array is [1,2]. The first output array starts with 0, then 1, 2, and ends with 0. Wait, maybe the first and last elements are zeros, and the middle elements are the input array. So for [1,2], the output becomes [0,1,2,0]. That makes sense for the first line. Then the second line is [1,1,2,2]. So each element from the input array is duplicated. So 1 becomes 1,1 and 2 becomes 2,2. Then, the third line comes from the second input array [3,8], making [3,3,8,8]. The fourth line starts with 0, then 3,8, then 0. So similar to the first line but using the second input array. So maybe each input array generates two lines in the output: one padded with zeros and the other duplicated elements. But how are they arranged?\n\nWait, looking at Example 0's output: first line is [0,1,2,0], which is the first input array with zeros added at the ends. Then the second line is [1,1,2,2], which duplicates each element. Then the third line is the second input array's elements duplicated. Fourth line is zeros around the second input array. So maybe the pattern is for each input array, create two lines: one padded with zeros and the other with duplicates, then interleave them. Wait, but in the output, the order is zero-padded first, then duplicates for the first input array, then duplicates and zero-padded for the next input array. Let me check.\n\nWait, in Example 0, the first input array [1,2] leads to two lines: [0,1,2,0] and [1,1,2,2]. Then the second input array [3,8] leads to [3,3,8,8] and [0,3,8,0]. But the output order is zero-padded first for the first array, then duplicated, then duplicated for the second array, then zero-padded. So the order for each input array is first zero-padded, then duplicated? Wait no. The first input array's lines are zero-padded first, then duplicated. The second input array's lines are duplicated first, then zero-padded. Because in the output of Example 0, the third line is [3,3,8,8], which is the duplicated version of [3,8], and the fourth line is zero-padded. So maybe for the first input array, we have zero-padded then duplicated. For subsequent arrays, it's duplicated then zero-padded? That might be the case.\n\nWait, let's check Example 1. Input arrays [1,8,4] and [8,3,8]. The output is:\n\n[0,1,8,4,0] (zero-padded)\n[1,1,8,4,4] (duplicated first element and last element duplicated)\n[8,8,3,8,8] (duplicated)\n[0,8,3,8,0] (zero-padded)\n\nSo here, the first input array's zero-padded comes first, then its duplicated. Then the second input array's duplicated comes first, then zero-padded. So perhaps the pattern is: for each input array, if it's the first in the input list, generate zero-padded then duplicated. For the subsequent input arrays, generate duplicated then zero-padded. Then arrange all these in order, appending each pair after the previous ones.\n\nWait, in Example 0, two input arrays. The output is four lines. The first two lines correspond to the first input array, and the next two to the second. The order for the first input array is zero-padded then duplicated. The second input array's lines are duplicated then zero-padded. Similarly in Example 1, the first input array has zero-padded then duplicated, the second input array's lines are duplicated then zero-padded.\n\nBut wait in Example 0's output lines:\n\nFirst line: [0,1,2,0] (zero-padded of first input)\nSecond line: [1,1,2,2] (duplicated of first input)\nThird line: [3,3,8,8] (duplicated of second input)\nFourth line: [0,3,8,0] (zero-padded of second input)\n\nSo for the first input array, it's zero then duplicate. For the second input, it's duplicate then zero. So the pattern is: for each input array except the last one, generate zero-padded then duplicated. For the last input array, generate duplicated then zero-padded? No, because in Example 0, there are two input arrays, and the second (last) input array's lines are duplicated followed by zero-padded. Similarly in Example 1, the second (last) array's lines are duplicated then zero-padded.\n\nBut in Example 2, the input has three arrays. Let's see:\n\nInput arrays [2,1,4], [8,0,2], [3,2,8]. The output is five lines. Let's break it down.\n\nFirst line: [0,2,1,4,0] \u2192 zero-padded of first array [2,1,4]\nSecond line: [2,2,1,4,4] \u2192 duplicated of first array (each end element duplicated)\nThird line: [8,8,0,2,2] \u2192 duplicated of second array [8,0,2] (each end duplicated)\nFourth line: [3,3,2,8,8] \u2192 duplicated of third array [3,2,8]\nFifth line: [0,3,2,8,0] \u2192 zero-padded of third array.\n\nWait, but the third array is the last in the input. So for the first input array, zero-padded then duplicated. For the second array, duplicated then zero-padded? Or wait, looking at the output:\n\nThe output lines for the first input array (2,1,4) are first and second lines. Then the second input array (8,0,2) is third line (duplicated), but the fourth line is the third input array's duplicated. Then fifth line is the third's zero-padded. Wait, this seems inconsistent.\n\nWait the output for Example 2 is:\n\n[0,2,1,4,0]\n\n[2,2,1,4,4]\n\n[8,8,0,2,2]\n\n[3,3,2,8,8]\n\n[0,3,2,8,0]\n\nWait, so the first array's lines are zero-padded and duplicated. Then the second array's line is duplicated. Third array's line is duplicated, then zero-padded. So maybe for all input arrays except the last, generate zero-padded and duplicated, but only for the first array? Because in Example 0, the first array contributes two lines, and the second array contributes two lines. In Example 1, same. In Example 2, three input arrays, output has five lines. Let's count:\n\nExample 0: 2 input arrays \u2192 4 output lines (2 per input array)\n\nExample 1: 2 input arrays \u2192 4 output lines (2 per input array)\n\nExample 2: 3 input arrays \u2192 5 output lines. Wait, but 3 arrays would give 2 per array, which would be 6, but here it's 5. Hmm, that's a problem. Let me recheck:\n\nExample 2 input is three arrays. The output has five arrays. Let me see:\n\nFirst array [2,1,4] \u2192 output lines 0 and 1: zero-padded and duplicated.\n\nSecond array [8,0,2] \u2192 output line 2: duplicated.\n\nThird array [3,2,8] \u2192 output lines 3 and 4: duplicated and zero-padded.\n\nWait, that's three input arrays, but the output lines are 2 (first array) +1 (second array) +2 (third array) =5. But that's inconsistent. So perhaps the pattern isn't the same for all arrays.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that each input array after the first is added with a duplicated line, and the last array also has a zero-padded line. Let me think again.\n\nLooking at the first example:\n\nInput arrays 1 and 2:\n\nEach input array's lines are:\n\nFirst array: zero-padded then duplicated.\n\nSecond array: duplicated then zero-padded.\n\nTotal lines: 4.\n\nIn Example 2, three input arrays:\n\nFirst array: zero-padded then duplicated. (lines 0 and 1)\n\nSecond array: duplicated (line 2)\n\nThird array: duplicated then zero-padded (lines 3 and 4). \n\nSo maybe the first array gets two lines (zero-padded and duplicated), then each subsequent array gets one duplicated line, except the last array, which gets duplicated and zero-padded. So for N input arrays:\n\nNumber of output lines = 2 (first array) + (N-2) *1 (middle arrays) + 2 (last array) ?\n\nWait in Example 0, N=2. So 2 (first) + 0 (middle) +2 (last) \u2192 4 lines. Which matches. In Example 1, N=2: same as example 0. Example 2, N=3: 2 (first) + 1 (middle) + 2 (last) =5. Which matches. So that seems to fit.\n\nSo the pattern is:\n\n- For the first input array: output zero-padded version, then duplicated version.\n\n- For each middle array (if any, i.e., when there are more than two arrays), output the duplicated version.\n\n- For the last input array: output duplicated version, then zero-padded version.\n\nWait, but in Example 2, the middle array is the second array. So the first array's lines: zero and duplicate. Then the second array (middle) outputs its duplicate. Then the third array (last) outputs duplicate and zero. So yes.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. For the first array in the input:\n\n   a. Create a new array that starts with 0, followed by the elements of the array, followed by 0. So for [1,2], it's [0,1,2,0].\n\n   b. Create another array where each element except the first and last is the same, but the first element is duplicated once, and the last element is duplicated once. Wait, in example 0, [1,2] becomes [1,1,2,2]. So each element is duplicated once. Wait, the input array length is 2. Output array for duplicated is [1,1,2,2]. So each element is duplicated. So for an array of length N, the duplicated array has each element repeated twice, making 2N elements. Wait wait, in example 1, input array [1,8,4] is length 3. The duplicated line is [1,1,8,4,4]. Wait, that's length 5. Original length 3, so (3 * 2) -1 =5? Because 1 is duplicated, 8 stays, 4 is duplicated. So perhaps the first element is duplicated, the middle elements stay, and the last element is duplicated. Hmm, that might be a different pattern.\n\nWait in example 0, the input [1,2] becomes [1,1,2,2]. So first and last elements are duplicated. Middle elements (if any) are kept once. But in the case of two elements, both are duplicated. For three elements, first and last are duplicated, middle remains. Like example 1's first array: [1,8,4] becomes [1,1,8,4,4]. The first element is duplicated, the middle elements (8) are single, and the last is duplicated. Similarly, in example 2's first array [2,1,4] becomes [2,2,1,4,4]. So first and last elements duplicated, middle elements as is. So the duplicated line for an array is: the first element is duplicated, the middle elements (if any) are as is, and the last element is duplicated. So the length increases by 1: original length N, duplicated line has N+1 elements. Wait, [1,8,4] is length 3, duplicated line is 5. Wait 3 \u2192 5? Wait no. Original length is 3, duplicated line is 5 elements. Wait 3 elements \u2192 5. So that would be adding two elements. How?\n\nWait let's see:\n\nOriginal array [a, b, c]. The duplicated line would be [a, a, b, c, c]. So first and last elements are duplicated once each, middle elements as is. So for N elements, the duplicated array has N+2 elements? Because each end element adds one more. So for N=2, [a, b] becomes [a, a, b, b], which is N*2. For N=3, [a, a, b, c, c] which is 3+2=5. Wait that's inconsistent. So perhaps the duplicated line is formed by duplicating the first and last elements once and keeping the middle elements once. So for any array, regardless of length, the duplicated array starts with two copies of the first element, then the middle elements as is, then two copies of the last element. Wait, for example 1's input array [8,3,8], the duplicated line is [8,8,3,8,8]. Which fits: first element 8 is duplicated, middle 3, then last 8 duplicated. So yes.\n\nSo the duplicated array is constructed as:\n\n- First element appears twice.\n\n- Middle elements (if any) appear once each.\n\n- Last element appears twice.\n\nSo for an array of length N, the duplicated array has (N + 1) elements. Because:\n\nOriginal N elements: first, (middle elements), last.\n\nDuplicated array: [first, first] + middle elements (each once) + [last, last]. So the total length is 2 (for first) + (N-2) (middle) + 2 (last) = 2 + N-2 +2 = N+2. Wait, but example 1's input array [1,8,4] (length 3) becomes duplicated array [1,1,8,4,4] (length 5). 3+2=5. So yes. So for N elements, duplicated array has N+2 elements.\n\nSo the steps for each input array:\n\nFor the zero-padded array: take the original array and add a 0 at the beginning and end. So [a, b] becomes [0,a,b,0].\n\nFor the duplicated array: duplicate the first and last elements once each, keeping the middle elements as is. So [a, b] becomes [a,a,b,b]. [a,b,c] becomes [a,a,b,c,c], etc.\n\nNow, how are these arranged in the output?\n\nLooking at the training examples:\n\n- For the first input array:\n\n   - Zero-padded array first.\n\n   - Then duplicated array.\n\n- For the last input array:\n\n   - Duplicated array first.\n\n   - Then zero-padded array.\n\n- For any middle arrays (if there are more than two input arrays):\n\n   - Only the duplicated array is added.\n\nSo for example 2:\n\nInput arrays are [2,1,4], [8,0,2], [3,2,8].\n\nFirst array: zero-padded then duplicated.\n\nSecond array (middle): duplicated.\n\nThird array (last): duplicated then zero-padded.\n\nThus, the output order is:\n\n[zero-padded of first array]\n\n[duplicated of first array]\n\n[duplicated of second array]\n\n[duplicated of third array]\n\n[zero-padded of third array]\n\nSo for the test input:\n\nTest input is:\n\n[2,8]\n\n[1,4]\n\n[3,4]\n\nSo three input arrays.\n\nFollowing the pattern:\n\nFirst array [2,8]:\n\nzero-padded \u2192 [0,2,8,0]\n\nduplicated \u2192 [2,2,8,8]\n\nSecond array [1,4] (middle):\n\nduplicated \u2192 [1,1,4,4]\n\nThird array [3,4] (last):\n\nduplicated \u2192 [3,3,4,4]\n\nzero-padded \u2192 [0,3,4,0]\n\nSo the output should be:\n\n[0,2,8,0]\n\n[2,2,8,8]\n\n[1,1,4,4]\n\n[3,3,4,4]\n\n[0,3,4,0]\n\nBut wait, let's check the order.\n\nThe test input has three arrays. So first array's zero and duplicate, middle array's duplicate, last's duplicate and zero. So the lines are:\n\nLine 1: zero-padded first array \u2192 [0,2,8,0]\n\nLine 2: duplicated first array \u2192 [2,2,8,8]\n\nLine 3: duplicated second array \u2192 [1,1,4,4]\n\nLine 4: duplicated third array \u2192 [3,3,4,4]\n\nLine 5: zero-padded third array \u2192 [0,3,4,0]\n\nSo that's five lines, which matches the structure of example 2, which had three input arrays and five output lines.\n\nSo the final answer should be these five arrays.",

        "cot_2": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. So, looking at the training examples, the input is a list of lists, and the output is a list of lists with more elements. Let's start with Example 0.\n\nInput for Example 0:\n[1, 2]\n[3, 8]\n\nOutput:\nFour lists. Let's look at each one. The first output row is [0, 1, 2, 0]. The second is [1,1,2,2], third is [3,3,8,8], and fourth is [0,3,8,0]. Hmm. So the first input list is [1,2]. The first output row starts with 0, then the original elements, then 0. The second row seems to duplicate the first element (1,1) and the last element (2,2). The third row duplicates the elements of the second input list [3,8] into 3,3 and 8,8. The fourth row starts with 0, then takes the first element of the second input list (3), then the last element of the second input list (8), and ends with 0. \n\nWait, maybe each input list is processed in a certain way, and the output is built by combining these processed parts. Let's check Example 1.\n\nInput Example 1:\n[1,8,4]\n[8,3,8]\n\nOutput has four rows again. First row starts with 0, then the input list elements, then 0. So for the first input list [1,8,4], the first output row is [0,1,8,4,0]. The second row is [1,1,8,4,4], which duplicates the first and last elements. The third row is [8,8,3,8,8], which comes from the second input list [8,3,8], duplicating the first and last elements. The fourth row is [0,8,3,8,0], starting and ending with 0, taking the first and last of the second input list. \n\nSo maybe the pattern is:\n\nFor each input list, create two rows. The first row is 0 followed by the elements of the list, followed by 0. The second row duplicates the first element twice and the last element twice, with the middle elements as they are. But looking at Example 0, the second input list [3,8] is transformed into [3,3,8,8] (third row) and [0,3,8,0] (fourth row). So for each input list, there are two rows in the output. But in Example 0, there are two input lists, leading to four output rows. Similarly, Example 1 has two input lists, leading to four output rows. Example 2 has three input lists and five output rows. Wait, no. Example 2's input has three lists, and output has five rows. Let's check:\n\nExample 2 Input:\n[2,1,4]\n[8,0,2]\n[3,2,8]\n\nOutput has five rows. The first row is [0,2,1,4,0], which is the first input list wrapped with 0s. Second row [2,2,1,4,4], which duplicates first and last elements. Third row [8,8,0,2,2] from the second input list. Fourth row [3,3,2,8,8] from the third input list. Fifth row [0,3,2,8,0], which seems to combine the third input list with 0s. Wait, but why five rows for three input lists? Because each input list after the first adds two rows except maybe the last one adds three? Not sure. Let me count again. Example 0: two input lists \u2192 four output rows. Example 1: two input lists \u2192 four output rows. Example 2: three input lists \u2192 five output rows. Hmm, maybe the first list adds two rows, each subsequent list adds two rows, but the last list adds an extra row. Or perhaps there's a different pattern.\n\nWait, looking at Example 2's output:\n\nRow 0: [0,2,1,4,0] \u2192 from first input list.\n\nRow 1: [2,2,1,4,4] \u2192 same as the first input list transformed (duplicate first and last).\n\nRow 2: [8,8,0,2,2] \u2192 from second input list.\n\nRow 3: [3,3,2,8,8] \u2192 from third input list.\n\nRow 4: [0,3,2,8,0] \u2192 from third input list with 0s.\n\nSo for the first input list, there are two rows. For each subsequent list, two rows except the last one which has two rows plus an additional one? Or maybe the pattern is:\n\nEach input list is followed by two rows: one where the first and last elements are duplicated, and another where the list is wrapped with 0s. Wait, but in Example 0:\n\nFirst input list [1,2] \u2192 first output row [0,1,2,0] (wrapped with 0s), and second row [1,1,2,2] (duplicate first and last). Then the second input list [3,8] \u2192 third row [3,3,8,8] (duplicate), fourth row [0,3,8,0] (wrapped with 0s). So for each input list, two rows: one that's wrapped with 0s, and another that duplicates first and last elements. Wait, no. Wait the order is: the wrapped 0s row comes first, then the duplicated elements row. Or maybe not. Let's check:\n\nIn Example 0, the first input list [1,2] leads to [0,1,2,0] (wrapped) and [1,1,2,2] (duplicate). Then the second input list [3,8] leads to [3,3,8,8] (duplicate) and [0,3,8,0] (wrapped). So for each input list, the order is wrapped then duplicated? No. Because in the first case, the wrapped comes first, then duplicated. For the second input list, duplicated comes first, then wrapped. That's inconsistent. Hmm.\n\nWait, let's see Example 1:\n\nInput lists [1,8,4] and [8,3,8].\n\nOutput rows:\n\n[0,1,8,4,0] (wrapped) \u2192 first list.\n\n[1,1,8,4,4] (duplicated first and last) \u2192 first list.\n\nThen third input list's duplicated: [8,8,3,8,8] \u2192 second list.\n\nThen wrapped: [0,8,3,8,0] \u2192 second list.\n\nSo for each input list, the order is wrapped first, then duplicated. Then for the next list, duplicated first, then wrapped. Wait, no. Wait in Example 1, the first list's rows are wrapped and duplicated, then the second list's rows are duplicated and then wrapped. So the order alternates? That would complicate things. Alternatively, maybe the first input list is processed as wrapped then duplicated, and each subsequent list is processed as duplicated then wrapped. Let's check Example 2.\n\nExample 2's input lists are [2,1,4], [8,0,2], [3,2,8].\n\nOutput rows:\n\nRow 0: [0,2,1,4,0] \u2192 wrapped first list.\n\nRow 1: [2,2,1,4,4] \u2192 duplicated first list.\n\nRow 2: [8,8,0,2,2] \u2192 duplicated second list.\n\nRow 3: [3,3,2,8,8] \u2192 duplicated third list.\n\nRow 4: [0,3,2,8,0] \u2192 wrapped third list.\n\nWait, so for the first list, wrapped and duplicated. Then the second list, duplicated. The third list, duplicated and then wrapped. But the second list isn't wrapped here. Hmm, maybe that's not the pattern.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for each input list, two transformations are done: wrap with 0s and duplicate first and last. But these transformations are applied in a way that alternates between them for consecutive lists. Wait, but in Example 2, after the first list's two transformations, the next lists are each followed by their own transformations, but maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is constructed by taking each input list and generating two rows: the first is the list wrapped with 0s, then the list with first and last elements duplicated. Then, after all input lists are processed, there's an additional row that wraps the last element's first and last elements with 0s. But that doesn't fit the examples.\n\nWait, looking at Example 2's output, after processing the three input lists, there's an additional row [0,3,2,8,0], which is the third list wrapped with 0s. But why? Let's see:\n\nIn Example 0, after processing two input lists, the output ends with the second list's wrapped version. Example 1 ends with the second list's wrapped version. Example 2 ends with the third list's wrapped version. So maybe for each input list, we generate two rows (duplicate and wrapped) in order. Wait, no. Because in Example 0:\n\nList1: wrap \u2192 [0,1,2,0]\n\nList1: duplicate \u2192 [1,1,2,2]\n\nList2: duplicate \u2192 [3,3,8,8]\n\nList2: wrap \u2192 [0,3,8,0]\n\nSo each list's transformations are wrap and duplicate, but the first list's wrap comes first, then duplicate, then the next list's duplicate comes first, then wrap. That seems inconsistent. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the order is that for each list, first the wrapped version is added, then the duplicated version. But in Example 0, the first list's wrapped and duplicated are added, then the second list's duplicated and wrapped. So it's wrap, duplicate for the first list, then duplicate, wrap for the second. Then Example 1: first list's wrap and duplicate, then second list's duplicate and wrap. But in Example 2, there are three lists. Let's see:\n\nList1: wrap, duplicate \u2192 rows 0 and 1.\n\nList2: duplicate, wrap \u2192 rows 2 and 3?\n\nWait, but in Example 2, the output rows for the second list are [8,8,0,2,2] (duplicate) and perhaps no wrap? Then the third list is processed as duplicated ([3,3,2,8,8]) and then wrapped ([0,3,2,8,0]). So for list 2 (second input list), only duplicate is added. Then list 3 (third input list) has both duplicate and wrap. So maybe the pattern isn't consistent. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the first list in the input is processed as wrap and duplicate, then each subsequent list is processed as duplicate and wrap, and the last list also has an extra wrap? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is constructed by interleaving the wrapped and duplicated versions of each input list. For example, the first list's wrap is added, then the next list's wrap is added, etc. But the examples don't support that. Let's think differently.\n\nLooking at the output rows:\n\nIn all examples, the first output row is the first input list wrapped with 0s. Then the second row is the first input list with first and last elements duplicated. Then the third row is the second input list with first and last elements duplicated. Then the fourth row is the second input list wrapped with 0s. Wait, Example 0:\n\nRows 0: wrap first list.\n\nRow 1: duplicate first list.\n\nRow 2: duplicate second list.\n\nRow3: wrap second list.\n\nYes, that fits. Example 1:\n\nRow0: wrap first list.\n\nRow1: duplicate first list.\n\nRow2: duplicate second list.\n\nRow3: wrap second list.\n\nYes. Example 2 has three input lists. Let's see:\n\nRow0: wrap first list.\n\nRow1: duplicate first list.\n\nRow2: duplicate second list.\n\nRow3: duplicate third list.\n\nRow4: wrap third list.\n\nWait, why? Because in Example 2, after the first two lists, perhaps the third list is processed as duplicate then wrap, but the second list's wrap is missing. Hmm, that's inconsistent.\n\nWait, Example 2 has three input lists. The output is:\n\nRow0: wrap first list.\n\nRow1: duplicate first list.\n\nRow2: duplicate second list.\n\nRow3: duplicate third list.\n\nRow4: wrap third list.\n\nSo for the first list, wrap and duplicate. For the second list, only duplicate. For the third list, duplicate and wrap. So the second list is missing its wrap. That doesn't fit the previous pattern. So perhaps there's another pattern here.\n\nAlternatively, the number of output rows is 2n +1, where n is the number of input lists. For example, in Example 0: 2 lists \u2192 4 rows (2*2). Example 1: 2 lists \u2192 4 rows. Example 2: 3 lists \u21925 rows. So 2*3=6, but it's 5. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output rows are structured as follows:\n\n- For each input list except the last, add two rows: wrap and duplicate.\n\n- For the last input list, add three rows: duplicate, wrap, and another wrap? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output consists of each input list's wrapped version, followed by all the duplicated versions of all input lists, and then the last input list's wrapped version again. But not sure.\n\nWait, looking back at Example 2's output:\n\nRow0: wrap first list.\n\nRow1: duplicate first list.\n\nRow2: duplicate second list.\n\nRow3: duplicate third list.\n\nRow4: wrap third list.\n\nSo it's like the first list's wrap, then all duplicates of each list in order, then the wrap of the last list. So for n input lists, the output has 1 (wrap first) + n duplicates (each list) +1 (wrap last) \u2192 total 2 + n. Example 0 has n=2, so 2+2=4 rows. Correct. Example 1: n=2 \u21924 rows. Example 2: n=3 \u21925 rows (2+3=5). That fits.\n\nSo the pattern is:\n\n1. The first row is the first input list wrapped with 0s (prepend 0, append 0).\n\n2. Then for each input list (including the first?), create a row where the first element is duplicated and the last element is duplicated, with the middle elements as they are. So for each input list, a row is added where the first element appears twice, then the middle elements as-is, then the last element appears twice.\n\n3. Finally, the last row is the last input list wrapped with 0s.\n\nWait, let's check with Example 0:\n\n- First row: wrap first list \u2192 [0,1,2,0].\n\n- Then each input list is processed to duplicate first and last elements:\n\n   - First list becomes [1,1,2,2] (row1).\n\n   - Second list becomes [3,3,8,8] (row2).\n\n- Finally, the last list is wrapped \u2192 [0,3,8,0] (row3).\n\nBut in Example 0, this gives 1 (wrap first) + 2 (each input list duplicated) +1 (wrap last) =4 rows. Which matches.\n\nExample 1:\n\nFirst row: wrap first list \u2192 [0,1,8,4,0].\n\nThen each list's duplicated:\n\nFirst list \u2192 [1,1,8,4,4] (row1).\n\nSecond list \u2192 [8,8,3,8,8] (row2).\n\nFinally, wrap last list \u2192 [0,8,3,8,0] (row3). So total 1+2+1=4 rows.\n\nExample 2:\n\nFirst row: wrap first \u2192 [0,2,1,4,0].\n\nThen each list duplicated:\n\nFirst \u2192 [2,2,1,4,4] (row1).\n\nSecond \u2192 [8,8,0,2,2] (row2).\n\nThird \u2192 [3,3,2,8,8] (row3).\n\nThen wrap last \u2192 [0,3,2,8,0] (row4). Total 1+3+1=5 rows. Which matches.\n\nYes! So the pattern is:\n\n- Start with the first input list wrapped in 0s at both ends.\n\n- Then, for each input list, create a row where the first element is duplicated (appears twice), followed by the middle elements as is, and the last element is duplicated (appears twice).\n\n- Finally, end with the last input list wrapped in 0s at both ends.\n\nSo for the test input:\n\nTest Input:\n\n[2,8]\n\n[1,4]\n\n[3,4]\n\nSo three input lists. Applying the pattern:\n\nFirst row: wrap the first list [2,8] \u2192 [0,2,8,0].\n\nThen for each list (three lists), generate a row with first and last elements duplicated:\n\nFirst list [2,8] \u2192 [2,2,8,8].\n\nSecond list [1,4] \u2192 [1,1,4,4].\n\nThird list [3,4] \u2192 [3,3,4,4].\n\nThen wrap the last list [3,4] \u2192 [0,3,4,0].\n\nSo the output should have 1 (first wrap) +3 (three duplicated rows) +1 (last wrap) =5 rows.\n\nPutting them in order:\n\nRow0: [0,2,8,0]\n\nRow1: [2,2,8,8]\n\nRow2: [1,1,4,4]\n\nRow3: [3,3,4,4]\n\nRow4: [0,3,4,0]\n\nWait, but looking at the examples, for each list in the duplicated rows, the first element is duplicated, then the rest except last, then the last is duplicated. So for example, [1,8,4] becomes [1,1,8,4,4]. Original length is 3, output is 5 elements. So for a list of length n, the duplicated row has 2 + (n-2) + 2 = n+2 elements? Wait, [1,8,4] (length 3) \u2192 [1,1,8,4,4] (length 5). So 3+2=5. So yes. So the test input's lists:\n\nFirst list is [2,8] (length 2). The duplicated row would be [2,2,8,8] (length 4).\n\nSecond list [1,4] \u2192 [1,1,4,4] (length 4).\n\nThird list [3,4] \u2192 [3,3,4,4] (length 4).\n\nWait, but in the training examples, the first row's length is original list length +2 (wrapped with 0s). So the first row's length is 2 +2=4 for a list of 2 elements. Similarly, for a list of 3 elements, the wrapped row is 5 elements.\n\nThen the duplicated row for a list of 2 elements would be first element twice, then the rest (none), then last element twice \u2192 length 4. For example, [1,2] becomes [1,1,2,2].\n\nSo applying this to the test input:\n\nFirst row: [0,2,8,0].\n\nThen duplicated rows for each input list:\n\n[2,2,8,8], [1,1,4,4], [3,3,4,4].\n\nThen last row: [0,3,4,0].\n\nSo the output would be:\n\n[0,2,8,0]\n\n[2,2,8,8]\n\n[1,1,4,4]\n\n[3,3,4,4]\n\n[0,3,4,0]\n\nWhich is five rows. That should be the answer."
