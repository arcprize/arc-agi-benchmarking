        "cot_1": "Okay, let's look at these training examples to figure out the pattern. So, each example has a 3x3 grid of numbers as input and output. My job is to find out how the input is transformed into the output.\n\nStarting with Example 0:\n\nInput:\n[2, 2, 1]\n[1, 5, 1]\n[5, 2, 2]\n\nOutput:\n[2, 1, 5]\n[2, 5, 2]\n[1, 1, 2]\n\nHmm, maybe the rows are reversed or rotated. Let's check each row. The first input row is [2,2,1], and the output's first column is [2,2,1] reversed? Wait, the output's first column is 2, 2, 1. Wait, looking at the output rows, the first output row is [2,1,5], which is the first input row's elements but maybe rotated. Wait, maybe it's columns being reversed? Let me check the columns of the input and output.\n\nOriginal columns (input):\nFirst column: 2,1,5 \u2192 Output first row is [2,1,5]. So maybe each column from the input becomes a row in the output, but reversed in some way. Like, the first column becomes the first row reversed? Let's see:\n\nInput columns:\nFor example 0, columns would be:\nCol0: 2,1,5 \u2192 becomes row0 of output as [2,1,5] \u2192 which is col0 reversed? No, because 2,1,5 reversed is 5,1,2. But output row0 is 2,1,5. So maybe the columns are taken in reverse order?\n\nWait, maybe the output is the transpose of the input matrix. The transpose of a matrix swaps rows and columns. Let's check:\n\nOriginal input for example0 is:\n\nRow0: 2,2,1\n\nRow1:1,5,1\n\nRow2:5,2,2\n\nTranspose would be:\n\nCol0:2,1,5 \u2192 row0 of transpose: 2,1,5\n\nCol1:2,5,2 \u2192 row1:2,5,2\n\nCol2:1,1,2 \u2192 row2:1,1,2\n\nBut the output is:\n\n[2,1,5]\n\n[2,5,2]\n\n[1,1,2]\n\nWhich matches exactly. So transpose of the input matrix. Wait, but in example0, the output is the transpose. Let's check example1.\n\nExample1 input:\n\n[2,2,5]\n\n[6,2,2]\n\n[5,5,5]\n\nTranspose would be:\n\nCol0:2,6,5 \u2192 row0:2,6,5\n\nCol1:2,2,5 \u2192 row1:2,2,5\n\nCol2:5,2,5 \u2192 row2:5,2,5\n\nBut the output is:\n\n[2,6,5]\n\n[2,2,5]\n\n[5,2,5]\n\nWhich matches the transpose. So yes, the output is the transpose of the input matrix. So each column of the input becomes the row of the output. But wait, in example3:\n\nInput for example3:\n\n[2,6,6]\n\n[2,1,1]\n\n[2,6,2]\n\nTranspose would be:\n\nCol0:2,2,2 \u2192 row0:2,2,2\n\nCol1:6,1,6 \u2192 row1:6,1,6\n\nCol2:6,1,2 \u2192 row2:6,1,2\n\nBut the output is:\n\n[2,2,2]\n\n[6,1,6]\n\n[6,1,2]\n\nWhich matches the transpose. So the pattern is taking the transpose of the input matrix. So for each test input, the output should be the transpose.\n\nWait, but let's check all examples again. Example2:\n\nInput:\n\n[9,9,5]\n\n[5,5,8]\n\n[5,8,9]\n\nTranspose:\n\nRow0:9,5,5\n\nRow1:9,5,8\n\nRow2:5,8,9\n\nWhich matches the output. So all examples are transpose. Then why the test input's output would be:\n\nTest input:\n\n[9,3,4]\n\n[9,4,4]\n\n[9,3,4]\n\nTranspose of this is:\n\nFirst column:9,9,9 \u2192 row0:9,9,9\n\nSecond column:3,4,3 \u2192 row1:3,4,3\n\nThird column:4,4,4 \u2192 row2:4,4,4\n\nBut wait, the output should be:\n\n[9,9,9]\n\n[3,4,3]\n\n[4,4,4]\n\nBut looking at the training examples, the outputs are presented as rows. So the answer should be:\n\n[9,9,9]\n\n[3,4,3]\n\n[4,4,4]\n\nBut let me check the formatting. The training examples outputs have the same number of rows as the inputs. So the transpose would require that. So the test input's output is the transpose. That's the pattern. So applying that, the answer is the transpose of the test input matrix.",

        "cot_2": "Okay, let's see. I need to figure out the pattern here. So, looking at the training examples. Let's take the first example:\n\nInput:\n[2, 2, 1]\n[1, 5, 1]\n[5, 2, 2]\n\nOutput:\n[2, 1, 5]\n[2, 5, 2]\n[1, 1, 2]\n\nHmm. How did they transform the input into the output? Let's look at each row and column. Maybe it's a rotation or a transpose? Wait, the output rows seem to be columns from the input. Let me check.\n\nOriginal input columns are:\nFirst column: 2,1,5\nSecond: 2,5,2\nThird:1,1,2\n\nBut the output rows are [2,1,5], [2,5,2], [1,1,2]. Oh right! So the output is the transpose of the input matrix. Because transpose swaps rows and columns. So each row in the output is a column from the input. Let's check the other examples.\n\nExample 1:\n\nInput:\n[2,2,5]\n[6,2,2]\n[5,5,5]\n\nColumns are:\n2,6,5\n2,2,5\n5,2,5\n\nOutput:\n[2,6,5]\n[2,2,5]\n[5,2,5]\n\nWhich matches the transpose. Yes. So transpose seems to be the pattern here.\n\nWait, but let's check Example 2 to confirm.\n\nInput:\n[9,9,5]\n[5,5,8]\n[5,8,9]\n\nColumns would be:\n9,5,5\n9,5,8\n5,8,9\n\nOutput is:\n[9,5,5]\n[9,5,8]\n[5,8,9]\n\nWhich is exactly the transpose. So yes, that works.\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput:\n[2,6,6]\n[2,1,1]\n[2,6,2]\n\nColumns:\n2,2,2\n6,1,6\n6,1,2\n\nOutput:\n[2,2,2]\n[6,1,6]\n[6,1,2]\n\nYes, transpose again. So the pattern is transposing the matrix. So the output is the transpose of the input matrix.\n\nSo for the test input:\n\nTest Input:\n[9,3,4]\n[9,4,4]\n[9,3,4]\n\nTransposing this matrix would take each column and make them rows.\n\nOriginal columns:\n\nFirst column: 9,9,9\nSecond:3,4,3\nThird:4,4,4\n\nSo output rows would be [9,9,9], [3,4,3], [4,4,4]. Let me check how the examples format their outputs. In the examples, each row is written as a list. So the output should be:\n\n[9,9,9]\n[3,4,3]\n[4,4,4]\n\nWait, but looking at the examples, when transposing, the first column of input becomes the first row of output, and so on. So yes. So applying that to the test case should give the correct output."
