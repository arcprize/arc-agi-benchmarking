        "cot_1": "Okay, let's see. I need to figure out the pattern from the training examples and apply it to the test input. Let's start by looking at the training examples.\n\nIn Example 0, the input has three rows of [2,2,2], then a [3,3,3], followed by seven rows of zeros. The output is similar but the last three rows are [3,3,3], then two [2,2,2]. Wait, the original first three rows are two [2,2,2] and one [3,3,3]. Then in the output, the last three rows become [3,3,3], [2,2,2], [2,2,2]. Hmm, maybe they're mirroring or flipping part of the structure.\n\nLooking at Example 1: Input starts with [2,2,2,2,2], then [8,8,...], followed by eight rows of zeros. The output has the same first two rows, then the last two rows are [8,8,...] and [2,2,...]. So the first two rows are preserved, and the last two rows are copies of the first two in reverse order. But how many rows are being mirrored?\n\nWait, Example 0's input has 10 rows. The output in Example 0 has the first three rows as original, then a bunch of zeros, then the last three rows are [3,3,3], [2,2,2], [2,2,2]. The original first three rows were two 2s and one 3. So maybe after the zeros, the non-zero rows are mirrored in reverse order.\n\nWait, in Example 0, the first three rows are [2,2,2], [2,2,2], [3,3,3]. Then the output's last three rows are [3,3,3], [2,2,2], [2,2,2]. That's the reverse of the first three. Similarly, in Example 1, the first two rows are [2,...] and [8,...], and the last two rows of the output are [8,...], [2,...], which is the reverse. So the pattern seems to be that after the initial non-zero rows, the rest are zeros, and then the non-zero rows are mirrored at the bottom. But how many rows are mirrored?\n\nLet me count the rows in each example. In Example 0 input: the first three rows are non-zero (rows 0,1,2), then seven zeros. The output has the first three as original, then seven rows, but the last three rows (rows 7,8,9) are the reversed first three. So original first three are mirrored at the bottom. But the original first three are two 2s and a 3. The mirrored version is 3, 2, 2. So the order is reversed.\n\nIn Example 1: first two rows are non-zero (rows 0 and 1), then eight zeros. The output has the first two rows as original, then the last two rows (rows 8 and 9) are the reversed first two. So 0 and 1 become 8 and 9 as 1 and 0.\n\nSo the pattern seems to be: the non-zero rows at the top are copied as is, then after all the zeros, the same non-zero rows are reversed in order and placed at the bottom, possibly overwriting some of the zero rows. The number of non-zero rows at the top is the same as the number of mirrored rows at the bottom.\n\nIn Example 0, there are three non-zero rows. So the bottom three rows are reversed copies. Similarly, Example 1 has two non-zero rows, so the bottom two are reversed.\n\nSo the steps would be:\n\n1. Identify how many initial rows are non-zero. Let's call this N.\n2. The output has the same initial N rows.\n3. The remaining rows are zeros except for the last N rows, which are the initial N rows reversed in order.\n\nWait, but in Example 0, the input has 3 non-zero rows, followed by 7 zeros. The output has the first 3, then 4 zeros, then the reversed 3. So total rows 10. Let's check:\n\nInput rows in Example 0: 10 rows. Output also 10. Original has 3 non-zero, then 7 zeros. The output has 3 non-zero, then 4 zeros, then 3 non-zero (the reversed ones). So 3 + 4 + 3 = 10. So after the first N rows, the middle zeros are the total rows minus 2*N. So if total rows is T, then zeros in the middle would be T - 2*N.\n\nBut in Example 1, input is 10 rows. N is 2 (first two non-zero). So middle zeros would be 10 - 2*2 =6. But the output in Example 1 has the first two, then 8 zeros except the last two. Wait, let me recount.\n\nExample 1 input is:\n\n[2,...] (row 0)\n[8,...] (row1)\n8 rows of zeros (rows 2-9). So total rows 10. Output:\n\nFirst two rows same, then rows 2-7 as zeros (6 rows), then rows 8 and 9 as [8,...] and [2,...]. So middle zeros are 6, which is 10 - 2*2 =6. So yes, the middle part is zeros for T - 2*N rows. Then the last N rows are the reversed N initial rows.\n\nSo applying this pattern to the test input.\n\nTest input has:\n\nRow 0: [3,3,3,3,3,3]\n\nRow 1: [5,5,5,5,5,5]\n\nRow 2: [5,5,5,5,5,5]\n\nRows 3-9: zeros. So N is the number of initial non-zero rows. Let's check each row:\n\nRow 0: non-zero (3's)\n\nRow 1: non-zero (5's)\n\nRow 2: non-zero (5's)\n\nRow 3-9: zeros. So N=3. Because rows 0,1,2 are non-zero.\n\nSo the output should have:\n\nFirst 3 rows as original: [3...], [5...], [5...]\n\nThen middle zeros: total rows is 10. So T=10. Middle zeros =10 -2*3 =4. So after the first 3, 4 zero rows, then 3 reversed initial rows.\n\nWait, the reversed initial rows would be the original first 3 rows in reverse order. The original first three are rows 0,1,2: [3's], [5's], [5's]. Reversed order would be [5's], [5's], [3's].\n\nSo the last three rows of the output should be [5...], [5...], [3...].\n\nBut wait, in Example 0, the initial three rows were [2,2,2], [2,2,2], [3,3,3]. Reversed they became [3,3,3], [2,2,2], [2,2,2]. So the first row becomes the last in the mirrored part, the second becomes the second last, etc.\n\nSo for the test input, the mirrored part would be row 2, then row 1, then row 0. Wait, no. Wait in Example 0, the initial three rows are:\n\nrow0: 2\n\nrow1: 2\n\nrow2:3\n\nIn the output, the mirrored part is row7:3, row8:2, row9:2. So the order is reversed. So the mirrored part is row2, row1, row0.\n\nWait, no. The original first three rows are in the order 2,2,3. The mirrored part is 3,2,2. So the mirrored part is the reverse of the original sequence. So for test input's first three rows: [3's], [5's], [5's], reversed would be [5's], [5's], [3's]. So the last three rows of the output would be [5's], [5's], [3's].\n\nBut the total rows in test input are 10. Let's count the output rows:\n\nFirst three rows: [3's], [5's], [5's]\n\nMiddle zeros: 10 - 2*3 =4 rows (positions 3,4,5,6)\n\nThen last three rows (7,8,9) would be the reversed initial three: [5's], [5's], [3's]\n\nWait, but positions 7,8,9. So:\n\nRow7: [5's] (original row2)\n\nRow8: [5's] (original row1)\n\nRow9: [3's] (original row0)\n\nSo the output would be:\n\n[3,3,3,3,3,3]\n\n[5,5,5,5,5,5]\n\n[5,5,5,5,5,5]\n\n[0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\n[0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\n[0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\n[0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\n[5,5,5,5,5,5]\n\n[5,5,5,5,5,5]\n\n[3,3,3,3,3,3]\n\nWait, no. Wait the middle zeros are 4 rows (rows 3-6). Then rows 7,8,9 are the reversed initial three. So the reversed initial three would be the original first three in reverse order. Original first three are:\n\nrow0:3's\n\nrow1:5's\n\nrow2:5's\n\nReversed order is row2, row1, row0. So the mirrored part would be [5's], [5's], [3's]. So rows 7,8,9 would be these.\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\nRows 0-2: same as input.\n\nRows 3-6: zeros.\n\nRows7:5's (original row2)\n\nRow8:5's (original row1)\n\nRow9:3's (original row0)\n\nWhich matches that structure. So the test output should have the mirrored rows at the bottom. That makes sense based on the training examples.",

        "cot_2": "Okay, let's see. I need to figure out the pattern between the input and output in the training examples and then apply it to the test input. \n\nLooking at Example 0. The input is a list of 10 rows. The first three rows are [2,2,2], [2,2,2], [3,3,3], followed by seven rows of zeros. The output changes the last two rows from zeros to [3,3,3], [2,2,2], [2,2,2]. Wait, no. Wait the input has 10 rows. Let me count again.\n\nInput Example 0:\n- Rows 0-2: [2,2,2], [2,2,2], [3,3,3]\n- Rows 3-9: all zeros (7 rows)\nOutput Example 0:\n- Rows 0-2 remain the same.\n- Rows 3-6 are zeros.\n- Row 7 becomes [3,3,3]\n- Rows 8-9 become [2,2,2], [2,2,2]\n\nHmm. So the original first three rows are followed by zeros, and then in the output, the last three rows (excluding the first three) have the third row (the [3,3,3]) and then two of the [2,2,2]. Wait, maybe the output is mirroring the first part. Like, after the initial non-zero rows, the bottom part mirrors them in reverse order. Let me check.\n\nIn Example 0, the first three rows are two 2s and one 3. The output's last three rows are 3, then two 2s. So that's the reverse. But the output has three rows modified at the bottom. The original input had three non-zero rows. So perhaps the pattern is that after the non-zero blocks, the bottom part of the list mirrors the top non-zero rows in reverse order. But how exactly?\n\nIn Example 0's input, the top three rows are non-zero. The output's bottom three rows are [3,3,3], [2,2,2], [2,2,2]. Wait, that's the third row of the input (the [3,3,3]) followed by the first two rows (the two [2,2,2]s) but reversed. So the order is reversed. The original top three rows, when reversed, would be [3,3,3], [2,2,2], [2,2,2]. So the output adds those at the bottom, replacing the last three rows. But wait, the input has 10 rows. So rows 7,8,9 (0-indexed) become the reversed top three rows. Let's see:\n\nOriginal input rows 0,1,2: [2,2,2], [2,2,2], [3,3,3]\n\nReversed order would be [3,3,3], [2,2,2], [2,2,2]. So in the output, these replace rows 7,8,9. But in the output, row 7 is [3,3,3], rows 8 and 9 are [2,2,2] each. So that's exactly the reversed top three rows. So the output is taking the initial non-zero rows, reversing their order, and placing them at the bottom, same number of rows as the initial non-zero ones. Then the middle rows are zeros.\n\nWait, in Example 0, the input has three non-zero rows (rows 0,1,2). The output places the reversed version starting at row 7 (so rows 7,8,9). That's three rows. So the number of non-zero rows at the top determines how many rows at the bottom are replaced with the reversed sequence.\n\nSimilarly, Example 1:\n\nInput has two non-zero rows: [2,2,2,2,2], [8,8,8,8,8], followed by 8 rows of zeros. The output has those two rows at the top, then the reversed order (8, then 2) at the bottom two rows. So rows 8 and 9 (since it's 10 rows total) become [8,8,..], [2,2,..]. So again, the number of non-zero top rows is two, so the bottom two rows are the reversed top two rows.\n\nSo the pattern seems to be: Take the initial consecutive non-zero rows from the top, reverse their order, and place them at the bottom of the list, replacing the same number of rows. The rest of the rows (middle ones) remain zeros.\n\nSo for the test input:\n\nTest input has three non-zero rows. Let's check:\n\nRows 0: [3,3,3,3,3,3]\n\nRow 1: [5,5,5,5,5,5]\n\nRow 2: [5,5,5,5,5,5]\n\nThen rows 3-9 are zeros. So the initial non-zero rows are three (rows 0,1,2). So according to the pattern, the reversed order of these three rows should be placed at the bottom three rows (rows 7,8,9 in 0-indexing? Wait the input is 10 rows, so rows 0-9. If the initial three rows are non-zero, then in the output, the reversed three rows would replace the last three rows. Wait in example 0, the three reversed rows were placed starting at row 7 (so rows 7,8,9). Because 10 rows total. So 10 - 3 =7. So rows 7,8,9. So in test input, the first three rows are non-zero. Reverse them: the order would be row 2, row 1, row 0. The original rows are [3s], [5s], [5s]. Reversed, that's [5s], [5s], [3s]. So the output's last three rows would be [5,5,5,5,5,5], [5,5,5,5,5,5], [3,3,3,3,3,3]. Wait no, reversed order of the first three rows. Let's list them:\n\nOriginal top three rows in test input:\n\nRow0: 3s\n\nRow1: 5s\n\nRow2:5s\n\nReversing these three rows would be row2, row1, row0. So the sequence becomes:\n\n[5,5,5,5,5,5], [5,5,5,5,5,5], [3,3,3,3,3,3]\n\nTherefore, in the output, the last three rows (rows 7,8,9) would be these reversed rows. Let's check the example 0 again. Original top three rows were [2,2,2], [2,2,2], [3,3,3]. Reversed order is [3,3,3], [2,2,2], [2,2,2], which were placed at rows 7,8,9.\n\nSo the test input's output should have rows 7,8,9 replaced with [5s (row2), 5s (row1), 3s (row0)].\n\nSo the middle rows (rows 3-6) would remain zeros, and rows 7-9 would be the reversed initial three rows.\n\nSo the test input's output would look like:\n\nFirst three rows same as input: [3s], [5s], [5s]\n\nThen rows 3-6: zeros\n\nRows 7: [5,5,5,5,5,5] (original row2)\n\nRow8: [5,5,5,5,5,5] (original row1)\n\nRow9: [3,3,3,3,3,3] (original row0)\n\nSo putting that together:\n\n[3,3,3,3,3,3]\n\n[5,5,5,5,5,5]\n\n[5,5,5,5,5,5]\n\n[0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\n[0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\n[0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\n[0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\n[5,5,5,5,5,5]\n\n[5,5,5,5,5,5]\n\n[3,3,3,3,3,3]\n\nWait, but looking at the training examples, in example 1, the first two rows are [2,..] and [8,..], then the output's last two rows are [8,..] and [2,..]. So reversed. So the same here, the three initial rows are reversed and placed at the end. So the test output would have rows 7,8,9 as the reversed initial three rows.\n\nTherefore, the final output for the test input should be as I listed above."
