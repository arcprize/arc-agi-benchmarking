        "cot_1": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. So, looking at the training examples. \n\nStarting with Example 0. The input has 8 rows. The first row is [2,1,4], the second [5,5,5], and the rest are all zeros. The output starts with the same first two rows. Then from the third row onwards, the zeros are replaced. The third row is [2,2,2], fourth [1,1,1], fifth [4,4,4], then again [2,2,2], [1,1,1], [4,4,4]. Hmm. So it looks like after the first two rows, the next rows are cycling through the elements of the first row. Like 2, then 1, then 4, then repeat. And each element is repeated in a row with the same length as the original. So for each element in the first array, we create a row where all elements are that number, and then cycle through them again.\n\nChecking Example 1. Input has first row [3,2,1,4], second [5,5,5,5], then zeros. The output starts with those two rows, then the next rows are 3,3,3,3; 2,2,2,2; 1,1,1,1; 4,4,4,4; then repeat the same sequence again. So same pattern: cycle through the first row's elements, each as a full row of that element. The second row (all 5s) is kept as is. So the process is: after the initial two rows, start repeating the elements from the first row in order, each as a row filled with that element, and loop when needed.\n\nExample 2: First row [8,3], second [5,5]. Output after that is [8,8], [3,3], [8,8], [3,3]. So again, cycling through the first row's elements. The number of rows after the initial two depends on the length of the input. Wait, in Example 0, the first row has 3 elements, and the output after the first two rows has 6 rows (3 elements cycled twice). Example 1 has 4 elements in the first row, and after the first two rows, there are 8 rows (4 elements cycled twice). Example 2 has 2 elements, output after initial rows has 4 rows (2 elements cycled twice). So the pattern seems to be that after the first two rows, each element of the first row is repeated as a row, and this sequence is repeated twice. Then the total number of new rows would be 2 * (number of elements in first row). \n\nWait, let's check:\n\nExample 0: 3 elements, 6 rows after initial two (3*2). Example 1: 4 elements, 8 rows (4*2). Example 2: 2 elements, 4 rows (2*2). So yes, the number of rows added after the first two is twice the length of the first row. \n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Keep the first two rows as they are.\n2. For each element in the first row (from input), create a row filled with that element. Do this in order.\n3. Repeat this list of elements' rows twice. So if the first row is of length n, you'll have 2n rows added after the first two.\n\nTesting this against the examples:\n\nIn Example 0, first row length 3. After initial two rows, 3*2=6 rows, which matches the output. The elements are 2,1,4, then 2,1,4 again.\n\nIn Example 2, first row length 2. So after two initial rows, 2*2=4 rows: 8,3,8,3.\n\nSo applying this pattern to the test input. The test input first row is [1,2,3,4,8], so length 5. The second row is all 5s. Then the rest are zeros. According to the pattern, after the first two rows, we need to create 5*2=10 rows. Wait, but the test input has after the first two rows, 10 rows (since total input rows are 12). Let me check:\n\nTest Input:\n\n[1,2,3,4,8] (first row, length 5)\n[5,5,5,5,5] (second row)\nThen 10 rows of zeros. \n\nSo according to the pattern, the output should have:\n\nFirst two rows as is.\n\nThen, for each element in the first row (1,2,3,4,8), create a row filled with that element. Then repeat this sequence again. So 5 elements, each as a row, twice. That's 10 rows. So the total rows in the output should be 2 (original) + 10 (new) = 12 rows. Which matches the test input's 12 rows.\n\nSo the output would be:\n\n[1,2,3,4,8]\n[5,5,5,5,5]\n[1,1,1,1,1]\n[2,2,2,2,2]\n[3,3,3,3,3]\n[4,4,4,4,4]\n[8,8,8,8,8]\n[1,1,1,1,1]\n[2,2,2,2,2]\n[3,3,3,3,3]\n[4,4,4,4,4]\n[8,8,8,8,8]\n\nThat should be the correct output. Let me double-check the training examples. Yes, each example follows this pattern. So the key is to take the first row's elements, create rows for each, then repeat that list once again. So the answer should be as above.",

        "cot_2": "Okay, let's see. I need to figure out the pattern that transforms the input into the output in the training examples. Let's start by looking at the examples one by one.\n\nStarting with Example 0. The input is:\n\n[2, 1, 4]\n[5, 5, 5]\n[0, 0, 0] (x6 times)\n\nThe output is:\n\n[2,1,4]\n[5,5,5]\n[2,2,2]\n[1,1,1]\n[4,4,4]\n[2,2,2]\n[1,1,1]\n[4,4,4]\n\nSo, the first two rows are the same as the input. Then the third row becomes [2,2,2], which are all the first element of the first input row. Then the next is [1,1,1], the second element. Then [4,4,4], the third element. Then it repeats again: 2,1,4. So for the 0 rows in the input, they are replaced by cycling through the elements of the first input array, each time creating a row where all elements are that number. The second input row is [5,5,5], which stays the same. So maybe the pattern is: after the first two rows, each subsequent row is filled with each element of the first array in order, repeating the cycle.\n\nLooking at Example 1. Input is:\n\n[3,2,1,4]\n[5,5,5,5]\n[0,0,0,0] x8 times.\n\nOutput starts with the first two rows same. Then third row is all 3s (first element of first array), next all 2s, then 1s, then 4s. Then it repeats 3,2,1,4 again. So same pattern here: after the initial two rows, cycle through each element of the first array, each time creating a row with all elements as that value. The number of rows after the first two depends on how many 0 rows there were in the input. For example, in example 0, there are 6 rows of zeros. The output after the first two has 6 rows (3 elements in first array, so 3 entries, then another 3 to make 6). So 3 elements, cycle twice. Similarly, example 1 has 8 rows of zeros, and the first array has 4 elements. So 4 elements, repeated twice (4*2=8). So the pattern is: the number of zero rows in the input is equal to the length of the first array multiplied by some integer. Then the output replaces each zero row with the elements of the first array in order, repeated enough times to cover all zero rows.\n\nWait, in example 0: the input after the first two rows has 6 zero rows. The first array has 3 elements. 6 is 3 * 2, so each element is repeated twice. So in output, the third row is element 0, then element 1, element 2, then again 0,1,2. So for each element in the first array, you create a row of that element, and cycle through them as many times as needed to cover all the zero rows.\n\nIn example 2, the input first array is [8,3], then [5,5], followed by four zero rows. The output replaces the zeros by cycling through 8,3,8,3. So two elements, each repeated twice (total 4 rows). So yes, same pattern.\n\nSo the general rule seems to be:\n\n- The first two rows of the input are kept as-is.\n- For the remaining rows (all zeros in the input), each row is replaced by a row where all elements are the nth element of the first array. The order is the elements of the first array in sequence, repeated as many times as needed to cover all zero rows.\n\nSo for the test input:\n\nThe first row is [1,2,3,4,8], the second [5,5,5,5,5], followed by 10 zero rows (since there are 10 rows after the first two in the test input). The first array has 5 elements. The number of zero rows is 10. So 5 elements, each will be repeated 2 times (5 * 2 =10). So the third row would be all 1s, then 2s, 3s,4s,8s, then repeat: 1,2,3,4,8 again. Let's check:\n\nTest input has 12 rows total. The first two are the input arrays. Then 10 rows of zeros. So the output after the first two should have 10 rows. The first array has 5 elements. 5 elements * 2 cycles =10 rows. So each element of the first array is used once per cycle, and there are two cycles. So the third row would be [1,1,1,1,1], next [2,2,2,2,2], then 3, then4, then8, then 1 again, 2,3,4,8. So the output would be:\n\n[1,2,3,4,8]\n[5,5,5,5,5]\n[1,1,1,1,1]\n[2,2,2,2,2]\n[3,3,3,3,3]\n[4,4,4,4,4]\n[8,8,8,8,8]\n[1,1,1,1,1]\n[2,2,2,2,2]\n[3,3,3,3,3]\n[4,4,4,4,4]\n[8,8,8,8,8]\n\nThat matches the expected pattern. Let me verify with the examples:\n\nExample 0: 3 elements, 6 zero rows. 3 elements repeated twice: 3*2=6. So the output after the first two rows is 3 elements, each appearing twice. Which matches the output given.\n\nYes. So applying this to the test input, the answer should be as above."
