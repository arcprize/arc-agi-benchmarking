        "cot_1": "Okay, let's see. I need to figure out the pattern here. So looking at the training examples, the input is a 3x3 grid and the output is another 3x3 grid. Let's compare them one by one.\n\nStarting with Example 0. The input has the first row as [1,1,1], and the other two rows are all zeros. The output shifts that first row down to the second row, making the first and third rows zero. So it's like moving the non-zero row down by one.\n\nExample 1's input has the middle row as [1,1,1], and the output moves that to the bottom row. So again, shifting down by one. Wait, but in Example 0, the non-zero row was at the top, and it moved to the middle. Then in Example 1, the non-zero row was in the middle and moved to the bottom. So maybe each non-zero row is shifted down, and the bottom row wraps around to the top? But in the examples given, when the non-zero is at the bottom, does it wrap? Let's check the other examples.\n\nExample 2's input has the first two rows as [0,1,0] and [1,1,0], then zeros. The output moves those two rows down, so the first row becomes zeros, the second is [0,1,0], and the third is [1,1,0]. So it's like shifting all rows down by one, and the bottom row disappears, replaced by zeros at the top? Or maybe each row is shifted down, pushing the bottom row out, and the top becomes zero.\n\nWait, let's look at Example 3. Input is first row [0,2,2], second [0,0,2], third zeros. The output shifts those first two rows down: the second row becomes [0,2,2], the third becomes [0,0,2], and the first becomes zeros. So yes, every row is shifted down by one, and the top row is filled with zeros. But in Example 0 and 1, it's similar. The non-zero rows are shifted down, and the top row (if they were at the top) become zeros. So maybe the pattern is that all rows are shifted down by one, and the topmost row(s) that are shifted out of the grid are replaced by zeros at the top.\n\nSo the transformation is: move each row down by one position. The bottom row is removed, and the top becomes a new row of zeros. Wait, but in Example 0, input is:\n\nRow 0: [1,1,1]\n\nRow 1: [0,0,0]\n\nRow 2: [0,0,0]\n\nOutput:\n\nRow 0: [0,0,0]\n\nRow 1: [1,1,1]\n\nRow 2: [0,0,0]\n\nSo the original row 0 is moved to row 1. Original row 1 (all zeros) moves to row 2, but since the output row 2 is all zeros, maybe the bottom row is discarded and a new row of zeros is added at the top. Wait, no. Because shifting down would push each row down, but what happens to the last row? Let me think.\n\nIf we imagine the grid as rows 0 (top), 1, 2 (bottom). The transformation would be:\n\nOutput row 0 is all zeros.\n\nOutput row 1 is input row 0.\n\nOutput row 2 is input row 1.\n\nSo the rows are shifted down by one, and the top row becomes zero. Because in Example 0, the input rows are A, B, C (where A is [1s], B and C zeros). The output is Zero row, then A, then B. But B was zeros, so row 2 becomes zeros. So yes, each row is shifted down, with the top row becoming zeros.\n\nWait, but in Example 3:\n\nInput rows:\n\n0: [0,2,2]\n\n1: [0,0,2]\n\n2: [0,0,0]\n\nOutput:\n\n0: [0,0,0]\n\n1: [0,2,2]\n\n2: [0,0,2]\n\nSo input row 0 moves to output row 1, input row 1 to output row 2, and input row 2 is discarded, replaced by zeros at the top. So the general rule is that each row shifts down by one, and the new top row is zeros. The bottom row of the input is removed, and the top row is new zeros.\n\nSo, for any input, the output is:\n\n- The new top row is all zeros.\n\n- The next rows are the input's rows starting from the top, but each shifted down by one.\n\nSo for the test input:\n\nTest Input:\n\n[2,0,0] (row 0)\n\n[2,0,0] (row 1)\n\n[0,0,0] (row 2)\n\nApplying the transformation:\n\nOutput row 0: [0,0,0]\n\nOutput row 1: [2,0,0] (original row 0)\n\nOutput row 2: [2,0,0] (original row 1)\n\nSo the output would be:\n\n[0,0,0]\n\n[2,0,0]\n\n[2,0,0]\n\nBut let's check the examples again to see if this holds.\n\nIn Example 2:\n\nInput:\n\nRow0: [0,1,0]\n\nRow1: [1,1,0]\n\nRow2: [0,0,0]\n\nOutput:\n\nRow0: [0,0,0]\n\nRow1: [0,1,0] (original row0)\n\nRow2: [1,1,0] (original row1)\n\nYes, matches. So the test input's output should have the first row as zeros, then the original row0 becomes row1, original row1 becomes row2. The original row2 is discarded. So the test input's output should be:\n\n[0, 0, 0]\n\n[2, 0, 0]\n\n[2, 0, 0]\n\nWhich matches the pattern. Let me confirm once more.\n\nAnother example: in Example 1, input is row1 as [1,1,1], others zero. Output shifts row1 to row2. So yes. So the pattern is shifting all rows down by one, inserting a zero row at the top. So the test case should follow this.",

        "cot_2": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. So, looking at the training examples, each input is a 3x3 grid, and the output is another 3x3 grid. My job is to see how the input gets transformed into the output.\n\nStarting with Example 0. The input has the first row as [1,1,1] and the other two rows as all zeros. The output shifts that [1,1,1] row down to the second row. So maybe it's shifting each row down by one? But wait, in the output of Example 0, the first row becomes zeros, the second row is the original first row, and the third row is still zeros. So that's like a downward shift.\n\nExample 1: Input is [0,0,0], [1,1,1], [0,0,0]. The output moves the [1,1,1] to the third row. So again, shifting down. The first row in the output is the original second row (which was zeros), then the third row becomes the original second row (the 1s). Wait, maybe it's rotating the rows. Like each row moves down, and the bottom row wraps around to the top? But in Example 0, the bottom row is zeros. Let's check.\n\nWait, in Example 0, the input rows are:\n\nRow 0: [1,1,1]\n\nRow 1: [0,0,0]\n\nRow 2: [0,0,0]\n\nOutput is:\n\nRow 0: [0,0,0]\n\nRow 1: [1,1,1]\n\nRow 2: [0,0,0]\n\nSo it's shifting each row down by one. The first row (row 0) moves to row 1, row 1 moves to row 2, and row 2 wraps around to row 0? Wait, but in Example 0's output, row 2 is still zeros. Hmm, no. Because in the input, row 1 and 2 are zeros, shifting down would mean row 0 becomes row 1, row 1 becomes row 2, and row 2 becomes row 0. But in the output, the new row 0 is zeros. Wait, maybe it's a shift where the rows are shifted downward, and the bottom row is filled with zeros. But in Example 0's output, the bottom row is still zeros. Wait, maybe not. Let me see:\n\nAnother approach: perhaps each row is moved down, and the bottom row is moved to the top? Let's test Example 0. Original rows:\n\n0: [1,1,1]\n\n1: [0,0,0]\n\n2: [0,0,0]\n\nIf we shift down, then row 2 becomes row 1's original, row 1 becomes row 0's original, and row 0 becomes row 2's original. But that would result in:\n\nrow 0: [0,0,0]\n\nrow 1: [1,1,1]\n\nrow 2: [0,0,0]\n\nWhich matches Example 0's output. So shifting each row down by one position, with the bottom row (row 2) being pushed to the top (row 0). Wait, that's a rotation. Because if you shift down, the rows are rotated. For example, in a list, shifting down would make the last element come to the front. Let's think of the rows as a list [A, B, C], then shifting down once would give [C, A, B]. Wait, no. Wait, if you shift down by one, each element moves down by one, and the last element wraps to the top. So, for a list [A, B, C], shifting down once would result in [C, A, B]. But in Example 0, the original is [A,B,C] where A is [1,1,1], B and C are zeros. Shifting down once would make it [C, A, B], which would be [0s, 1s, 0s], which is what the output is. So yes, that's a rotation. So the output is a rotated version of the input, where each row is shifted down by one, with the last row moving to the top.\n\nWait, but in Example 1, the input is [0s, 1s, 0s]. Shifting down once would make it [0s (original row2), 0s (original row0), 1s (original row1)]. Wait, no. Let me list the rows for Example 1's input:\n\nOriginal rows:\n\n0: [0,0,0]\n\n1: [1,1,1]\n\n2: [0,0,0]\n\nShifting down once (rotation) would result in:\n\nnew row0: original row2 \u2192 [0,0,0]\n\nnew row1: original row0 \u2192 [0,0,0]\n\nnew row2: original row1 \u2192 [1,1,1]\n\nBut the output of Example 1 is:\n\n[0,0,0]\n\n[0,0,0]\n\n[1,1,1]\n\nWhich matches that. So yes, the pattern is that the entire grid is rotated down by one. So each row moves down one, with the last row wrapping around to the top. So row0 becomes row1's original, row1 becomes row2's original, row2 becomes row0's original. Wait, no. Wait, when you shift down, the indices increase. So in a normal shift down, each row moves to the next lower index. So row0 moves to row1, row1 to row2, row2 wraps to row0. So for example, if you have rows A, B, C (indices 0,1,2), shifting down would result in C, A, B. Because after shifting, row0 is the previous row2 (C), row1 is previous row0 (A), row2 is previous row1 (B). So yes, that's a downward rotation.\n\nSo in Example 0:\n\nInput rows:\n\nA [1s], B [0s], C [0s]\n\nShifting down gives:\n\nC [0s], A [1s], B [0s]\n\nWhich is the output. So the output is [C, A, B]. So the pattern is that each input grid is rotated down by one, so the new row0 is the original row2, new row1 is original row0, new row2 is original row1.\n\nWait, no. Let me check again. If shifting down by one row, each row moves down by one. So row0 becomes row1, row1 becomes row2, and row2 becomes row0? Or is it the other way around. Let me think of a rotation. If you imagine a list of three elements, and you rotate them down (like moving each element down one position, with the last element wrapping to the top). For example, list [A,B,C], rotating down once would result in [C, A, B]. Because each element moves down by one position. So A (index0) moves to index1, B (index1) moves to index2, C (index2) moves to index0. So yes, that's a right rotation (if you think of the list as circular). So for a 3x3 grid, rotating each row down by one would result in the new rows being [original row2, original row0, original row1].\n\nLet's test this with Example 2:\n\nInput:\n\nRow0: [0,1,0]\n\nRow1: [1,1,0]\n\nRow2: [0,0,0]\n\nAfter rotation down, new rows should be:\n\nRow0: original row2 \u2192 [0,0,0]\n\nRow1: original row0 \u2192 [0,1,0]\n\nRow2: original row1 \u2192 [1,1,0]\n\nWhich matches the output of Example 2. And Example 3:\n\nInput rows:\n\nRow0: [0,2,2]\n\nRow1: [0,0,2]\n\nRow2: [0,0,0]\n\nAfter rotation:\n\nRow0 \u2192 original row2 \u2192 [0,0,0]\n\nRow1 \u2192 original row0 \u2192 [0,2,2]\n\nRow2 \u2192 original row1 \u2192 [0,0,2]\n\nWhich matches the output of Example 3. So yes, the pattern is that the entire grid is rotated down by one row. Each row shifts down, with the last row (row2) moving to the top (row0), and the others shifting down.\n\nSo the transformation is to rotate the rows downward by one. So the new row0 is the original row2, new row1 is original row0, new row2 is original row1.\n\nNow, let's apply this to the test input.\n\nTest Input:\n\nRow0: [2,0,0]\n\nRow1: [2,0,0]\n\nRow2: [0,0,0]\n\nAfter rotation down, the new rows should be:\n\nRow0: original row2 \u2192 [0,0,0]\n\nRow1: original row0 \u2192 [2,0,0]\n\nRow2: original row1 \u2192 [2,0,0]\n\nSo the output would be:\n\n[0,0,0]\n\n[2,0,0]\n\n[2,0,0]\n\nBut let's confirm with the examples. Let's see if this matches the pattern. The test input's rows are [2,0,0], [2,0,0], [0,0,0]. Rotated down, row0 becomes row2's original (all zeros), row1 is row0's original (2,0,0), row2 is row1's original (2,0,0). So the output should have the first row as zeros, then the original first row, then the original second row.\n\nYes. So the output is:\n\n[0,0,0]\n\n[2,0,0]\n\n[2,0,0]\n\nWhich would be the correct answer."

        "cot_1": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. So, there are these input grids and output grids, and I need to see what transformation is happening. Let me look at the examples one by one.\n\nStarting with Example 0:\n\nInput:\n[1,1,1]\n[0,0,0]\n[0,0,0]\n\nOutput:\n[0,0,0]\n[1,1,1]\n[0,0,0]\n\nHmm, so the top row (all 1s) moved down to the middle row. The middle and bottom rows shifted down as well, but since there are three rows, maybe the bottom row wraps around? Wait, in the output, the bottom row becomes the middle, but in Example 0, the original middle row was zeros and becomes the new bottom. Wait no, original input's middle and bottom are both zeros. So the first row moved down to the middle, pushing the others down. But since the grid is 3x3, maybe it's a shift down, and the last row wraps to the top? But in Example 0's output, the last row is zeros again, which was the original middle and bottom. So maybe it's a shift where each row moves down one, and the bottom row disappears? Or perhaps it's rotating the non-zero rows downward.\n\nWait, in Example 0, the input's first row is non-zero (all 1s), and in the output, it's in the second row. Then in Example 1:\n\nInput:\n[0,0,0]\n[1,1,1]\n[0,0,0]\n\nOutput:\n[0,0,0]\n[0,0,0]\n[1,1,1]\n\nSo here, the middle row (1s) moves down to the bottom row. The top and middle become zeros. So maybe the non-zero row is moving down by one each time, and if it's already at the bottom, it wraps around? Wait, but in Example 0's output, the 1s moved from top to middle, and in Example 1, middle to bottom. Then in Example 2:\n\nInput:\n[0,1,0]\n[1,1,0]\n[0,0,0]\n\nOutput:\n[0,0,0]\n[0,1,0]\n[1,1,0]\n\nLooking here, the first two rows have 1s. The output has those rows shifted down. The first row [0,1,0] moves down to the second row, and the second row [1,1,0] moves down to the third row. The top becomes zeros. So it's like all the non-zero rows are shifted down by one, and the top row is filled with zeros. But wait, in the input, maybe each row's non-zero elements are shifted down, but if there are multiple non-zero rows, they all shift down, with the bottom row being pushed out or something.\n\nWait, in Example 2's input, the first two rows have non-zero elements. The output shifts both down. So the first row becomes zero, the second becomes the original first, and the third becomes the original second. Wait, no. Original first row is [0,1,0], which in output becomes the second row. Original second row [1,1,0] becomes the third row. So each row is shifted down, and the top row is filled with zeros. But how does that work if there are multiple non-zero rows? Like, maybe all the rows are shifted down by one, and the top row becomes zeros. But that's not exactly. Let's see.\n\nIn Example 3:\n\nInput:\n[0,2,2]\n[0,0,2]\n[0,0,0]\n\nOutput:\n[0,0,0]\n[0,2,2]\n[0,0,2]\n\nSo here, the first row [0,2,2] moves down to the second row, and the second row [0,0,2] moves down to the third row. The first row becomes zeros. So again, shifting all rows down by one, and the top row becomes zeros. The bottom row in the input (third row) is zeros, so when shifted down, it's replaced by the second row's original values, and the third row in output is the original second row. So this seems to be the pattern: each row is shifted down by one position, with the top row being replaced by zeros. Wait, but in Example 0, the original first row (all 1s) moves to the second row, the original second and third (zeros) move down to third and... but in the output, the third row is zeros. So perhaps it's a shift down where each row is moved down one, and the top row is filled with zeros. So for a 3x3 grid, the new first row is zeros, the new second row is the original first, the new third row is the original second. The original third row is discarded? Because in Example 0, the original third row was zeros, and after shifting down, the new third row is the original second row (zeros), so it's like the third row is pushed out and replaced by the second. So maybe it's a rotation of rows down by one, with the top row becoming zeros.\n\nWait, maybe the transformation is that all existing rows are shifted down by one, and the top row is filled with zeros. So the first row becomes zeros, the second row is the original first, the third is the original second. The original third row is not present anymore. Wait, but that would only work if we have three rows. So for a 3x3 grid, shifting down would mean:\n\nOriginal rows: row0, row1, row2.\n\nAfter shift:\n\nnew row0: zeros\n\nnew row1: original row0\n\nnew row2: original row1\n\nSo the original row2 is lost. Let's test this against the examples.\n\nExample 0 input:\n\nrow0: [1,1,1]\n\nrow1: [0,0,0]\n\nrow2: [0,0,0]\n\nShift down:\n\nnew row0: [0,0,0]\n\nnew row1: [1,1,1]\n\nnew row2: [0,0,0]\n\nWhich matches the output.\n\nExample1 input:\n\nrow0: [0,0,0]\n\nrow1: [1,1,1]\n\nrow2: [0,0,0]\n\nShift down:\n\nnew row0: zeros\n\nnew row1: original row0 (all zeros)\n\nnew row2: original row1 (all 1s)\n\nSo output would be:\n\n[0,0,0]\n\n[0,0,0]\n\n[1,1,1]\n\nWhich matches.\n\nExample2 input:\n\nrow0: [0,1,0]\n\nrow1: [1,1,0]\n\nrow2: [0,0,0]\n\nShift down:\n\nnew row0: zeros\n\nnew row1: row0 \u2192 [0,1,0]\n\nnew row2: row1 \u2192 [1,1,0]\n\nSo output:\n\n[0,0,0]\n\n[0,1,0]\n\n[1,1,0]\n\nWhich matches.\n\nExample3 input:\n\nrow0: [0,2,2]\n\nrow1: [0,0,2]\n\nrow2: [0,0,0]\n\nShift down:\n\nnew row0: zeros\n\nnew row1: row0 \u2192 [0,2,2]\n\nnew row2: row1 \u2192 [0,0,2]\n\nOutput matches.\n\nSo the pattern is: shift all rows down by one, inserting a new row of zeros at the top. The original bottom row (row2) is removed, and the previous rows are shifted down. So for each input grid, the output is the grid with each row moved down by one, top becomes zeros, and the original third row is gone (since it's shifted to the fourth row, which doesn't exist in a 3x3 grid, so it's discarded).\n\nWait, but how does that work with the original third row? In the first example, the original third row is [0,0,0], which becomes the new row2, but in the output, row2 is the original row1. Wait, perhaps the original rows are shifted down, so the new row0 is zeros, new row1 is original row0, new row2 is original row1. The original row2 is not part of the output. So the process is: the first row becomes zeros, then the previous rows are shifted down. So in a 3-row grid, the original third row is not present in the output. But that's not possible because the output must have three rows. So the original third row is shifted out and discarded, and the new third row is the original second row.\n\nSo the rule is: insert a new row of zeros at the top, then remove the bottom row. Wait, that's equivalent to shifting all rows down by one and filling the top with zeros, but keeping the same number of rows. So each row is moved down one, the top becomes zeros, and the last row is pushed out. Wait, but in a 3x3 grid, shifting down would require that each row is shifted down, and the bottom row is lost. But in the examples, the output is always three rows, so the total rows remain the same. Therefore, the way it works is: each row is moved down by one position, the top row is filled with zeros. So:\n\nOriginal rows:\n\nRow 0 \u2192 becomes Row 1\n\nRow 1 \u2192 becomes Row 2\n\nRow 2 \u2192 is replaced by zeros? No, wait, in Example0, the original row0 (1s) becomes row1, row1 (0s) becomes row2, and row2 (0s) is not present. Wait, but the output has three rows, so where does row2 in the output come from? In Example0, output row2 is [0,0,0], which was original row1. Wait, that's confusing. Let me think again.\n\nLooking at Example0:\n\nInput rows:\n\n0: [1,1,1]\n\n1: [0,0,0]\n\n2: [0,0,0]\n\nAfter transformation, output rows:\n\n0: [0,0,0]\n\n1: [1,1,1]\n\n2: [0,0,0]\n\nSo the original row0 moved to row1, row1 moved to row2, and row2 is gone. But output has three rows, so row2 in the output is original row1. So the process is: each row is shifted down by one, the top row becomes zeros, and the bottom row is the original row1. So the original row2 is discarded. Wait, but that's not possible because the grid size remains the same. So perhaps the rows are shifted down, with the original row0 moving to row1, row1 to row2, and row2 wraps around to the top? But in Example0, the original row2 is zeros, so if it wraps around, the new row0 would be row2 (zeros), which matches. But in that case, the output would be:\n\nOriginal row2 (zeros) \u2192 new row0\n\nOriginal row0 (1s) \u2192 new row1\n\nOriginal row1 (0s) \u2192 new row2\n\nWhich would give:\n\n[0,0,0]\n\n[1,1,1]\n\n[0,0,0]\n\nWhich is exactly Example0's output. So maybe it's a circular shift where all rows are shifted down by one, and the original bottom row (row2) becomes the new top row. But that's not the case. Because in Example0, the original row2 is zeros, and it becomes the new row0. But in the output, row0 is zeros. So that fits. But in Example1, original row0 is zeros, row1 is 1s, row2 is zeros. Shifting down circularly would make row2 (zeros) the new row0, row0 (zeros) becomes row1, row1 (1s) becomes row2. So output would be:\n\n[0,0,0]\n\n[0,0,0]\n\n[1,1,1]\n\nWhich matches Example1's output. Wait, that's exactly what the outputs are. So maybe the pattern is a circular shift down by one. Let's check Example2:\n\nInput rows:\n\n0: [0,1,0]\n\n1: [1,1,0]\n\n2: [0,0,0]\n\nCircular shift down:\n\nNew row0: original row2 \u2192 [0,0,0]\n\nNew row1: original row0 \u2192 [0,1,0]\n\nNew row2: original row1 \u2192 [1,1,0]\n\nWhich gives the output of Example2.\n\nSimilarly, Example3:\n\nInput rows:\n\n0: [0,2,2]\n\n1: [0,0,2]\n\n2: [0,0,0]\n\nCircular shift down:\n\nNew row0: [0,0,0] (original row2)\n\nNew row1: [0,2,2] (original row0)\n\nNew row2: [0,0,2] (original row1)\n\nWhich matches the output.\n\nSo the pattern is a circular shift downward. Each row is shifted down by one position, and the last row (row2) wraps around to the top (row0). Wait, but in the outputs, row0 is always zeros in the examples. But in Example2's output, row0 is zeros because original row2 was zeros. If original row2 had non-zero elements, they would wrap to the top. For example, if input was:\n\n[0,0,0]\n\n[0,0,0]\n\n[1,1,1]\n\nThen shifting down circularly would result in:\n\n[1,1,1]\n\n[0,0,0]\n\n[0,0,0]\n\nBut according to the previous examples, when the input is all 1s in the bottom row, the output would have them in the top. But in the training examples, when the 1s are in the middle (Example1), shifting down would move them to the bottom. So this circular shift seems to fit.\n\nSo the transformation is that each row is shifted down by one in a circular manner, meaning the bottom row becomes the top row, and others shift down. Wait, no. Because in a circular shift down, each element moves down, and the last element wraps to the top. So for a list [a, b, c], a circular shift down would make it [c, a, b]. So in terms of rows, the bottom row moves to the top, and others shift down.\n\nYes, that's right. So for a 3x3 grid:\n\nOriginal rows:\n\nrow0, row1, row2.\n\nAfter circular shift down (each row shifts down, and row2 wraps to row0):\n\nnew row0 = original row2\n\nnew row1 = original row0\n\nnew row2 = original row1\n\nSo the output rows are [row2, row0, row1].\n\nTesting this with Example0:\n\nOriginal rows:\n\nrow0: [1,1,1]\n\nrow1: [0,0,0]\n\nrow2: [0,0,0]\n\nShifted down circularly:\n\nnew row0: row2 \u2192 [0,0,0]\n\nnew row1: row0 \u2192 [1,1,1]\n\nnew row2: row1 \u2192 [0,0,0]\n\nWhich matches the output.\n\nExample1:\n\nOriginal rows:\n\nrow0: [0,0,0]\n\nrow1: [1,1,1]\n\nrow2: [0,0,0]\n\nShifted down:\n\nnew row0: row2 \u2192 [0,0,0]\n\nnew row1: row0 \u2192 [0,0,0]\n\nnew row2: row1 \u2192 [1,1,1]\n\nWhich matches the output.\n\nExample2:\n\nOriginal rows:\n\nrow0: [0,1,0]\n\nrow1: [1,1,0]\n\nrow2: [0,0,0]\n\nShifted down:\n\nnew row0: row2 \u2192 [0,0,0]\n\nnew row1: row0 \u2192 [0,1,0]\n\nnew row2: row1 \u2192 [1,1,0]\n\nWhich matches.\n\nExample3:\n\nOriginal rows:\n\nrow0: [0,2,2]\n\nrow1: [0,0,2]\n\nrow2: [0,0,0]\n\nShifted down:\n\nnew row0: row2 \u2192 [0,0,0]\n\nnew row1: row0 \u2192 [0,2,2]\n\nnew row2: row1 \u2192 [0,0,2]\n\nWhich matches the output.\n\nSo the pattern is a circular downward shift of all rows by one. Each row moves down, and the last row wraps to the top.\n\nNow, applying this to the test input.\n\nTest Input:\n\n[0, 0, 0]\n\n[0, 1, 0]\n\n[0, 0, 0]\n\nOriginal rows:\n\nrow0: [0,0,0]\n\nrow1: [0,1,0]\n\nrow2: [0,0,0]\n\nApplying the circular shift down:\n\nnew row0 = original row2 \u2192 [0,0,0]\n\nnew row1 = original row0 \u2192 [0,0,0]\n\nnew row2 = original row1 \u2192 [0,1,0]\n\nSo the output should be:\n\n[0,0,0]\n\n[0,0,0]\n\n[0,1,0]\n\nWait, but according to the pattern, the new rows are [row2, row0, row1], which would be:\n\nrow0: [0,0,0] (original row2)\n\nrow1: [0,0,0] (original row0)\n\nrow2: [0,1,0] (original row1)\n\nSo the output should be:\n\n[0,0,0]\n\n[0,0,0]\n\n[0,1,0]\n\nBut let me check if that's correct. Wait, in Example2, the input was:\n\n[0,1,0]\n\n[1,1,0]\n\n[0,0,0]\n\nWhich shifted to:\n\n[0,0,0] (row2)\n\n[0,1,0] (row0)\n\n[1,1,0] (row1)\n\nSo yes. So in the test case, shifting down circularly, the output rows are:\n\nrow0: original row2 \u2192 [0,0,0]\n\nrow1: original row0 \u2192 [0,0,0]\n\nrow2: original row1 \u2192 [0,1,0]\n\nWhich would make the output:\n\n[0, 0, 0]\n\n[0, 0, 0]\n\n[0, 1, 0]\n\nBut let me think again. Wait, in the test input, the original row1 is [0,1,0], which is the middle row. So after shifting, row2 becomes the original row1, which is [0,1,0]. So the output's third row would be [0,1,0], and the first and second rows are original row2 and row0, which are both [0,0,0].\n\nYes, that's correct. So the final answer should be as above.",

        "cot_2": "Okay, let's tackle this puzzle. So, the task is to figure out the pattern that transforms the input matrices into the output matrices. Let's look at the training examples one by one and see if I can spot a pattern.\n\nStarting with Example 0. The input is:\n\n[1, 1, 1]\n[0, 0, 0]\n[0, 0, 0]\n\nAnd the output is:\n\n[0, 0, 0]\n[1, 1, 1]\n[0, 0, 0]\n\nHmm, so the row of 1s in the first row moved down to the second row. It looks like it's shifting down by one. But wait, what happens to the last row? In the input, the third row was all zeros, and in the output, the third row is still zeros. So maybe each row is shifting down, and the bottom row wraps around? Wait, in Example 0, the first row shifts down to the second, and the second row (which was all zeros) becomes the third. But in the output, the third row is zeros. Wait no, the output's third row is zeros. So maybe it's shifting each row down by one, and the bottom row disappears or becomes zero? Or perhaps the entire matrix is shifted down, with the bottom row being dropped and a new top row of zeros added. Wait, let me check again.\n\nExample 0 Input:\nRow 0: [1,1,1]\nRow 1: [0,0,0]\nRow 2: [0,0,0]\n\nOutput:\nRow 0: [0,0,0]\nRow 1: [1,1,1]\nRow 2: [0,0,0]\n\nSo the first row moved to the second, and the top row became zeros. So perhaps it's shifting the entire matrix down by one, and the top row becomes zeros. Wait, but in that case, the original second and third rows would shift down, but since there's no row below the third, maybe those rows get replaced? Or maybe it's a rotation where each row shifts down, and the last row wraps around to the top. But in Example 0, the original third row (all zeros) would wrap to the top, but the output's top row is zeros. Wait, maybe not. Let me check Example 1.\n\nExample 1 Input:\n[0,0,0]\n[1,1,1]\n[0,0,0]\n\nOutput:\n[0,0,0]\n[0,0,0]\n[1,1,1]\n\nSo here, the second row (with 1s) moves down to the third row. The top row becomes zeros again. So the pattern here seems like each row is shifted down by one position, and the top row is filled with zeros. But where does the original third row go? In Example 0's input, the third row is zeros, and in the output, the third row is zeros again. So maybe when shifting down, the third row is pushed out and the first row becomes zeros. Wait, but in Example 1's input, the third row is zeros, and the output's third row is the 1s from the second row. So the third row is replaced by the second row. So the shifting is that each row moves down by one, the last row is removed, and the first row is set to zeros. Wait, maybe the entire matrix is shifted down, with the bottom row being lost, and a new row of zeros added at the top. Wait, that doesn't fit. Let's see:\n\nOriginal in Example 0:\n\nRow 0: 1s\n\nRow 1: 0s\n\nRow 2: 0s\n\nIf we shift all rows down, then row 0 would go to row 1, row 1 to row 2, and row 2 would wrap to row 0 (if it's a circular shift). But the output's row 0 is 0s. So that can't be it. Alternatively, maybe it's not a circular shift. Maybe each row is shifted down, the last row is removed, and a new row of zeros is added at the top. Wait, but the matrix size remains 3x3. Let's check:\n\nIn Example 0, after shifting down, the first row (1s) moves to row 1, row 1 (0s) to row 2, and row 2 (0s) is removed. Then a new row of 0s is added at the top. So the output would have:\n\nNew row 0: 0s\n\nRow 1: 1s (from original row 0)\n\nRow 2: 0s (from original row 1)\n\nBut the original row 2 was 0s and is now removed. That fits the output. Similarly, Example 1:\n\nOriginal rows:\n\nRow0: 0s\n\nRow1:1s\n\nRow2:0s\n\nShift down:\n\nRow0 becomes row1 (0s)\n\nRow1 becomes row2 (1s)\n\nRow2 is removed. New row0 is 0s. So output is:\n\nRow0:0s\n\nRow1:0s (original row0)\n\nRow2:1s (original row1)\n\nWhich matches the output. So the pattern is that each row shifts down by one, the bottom row is discarded, and a new top row of zeros is added. Wait, but in Example 2:\n\nInput:\n\n[0,1,0]\n\n[1,1,0]\n\n[0,0,0]\n\nOutput:\n\n[0,0,0]\n\n[0,1,0]\n\n[1,1,0]\n\nAccording to the pattern, shifting down each row:\n\nOriginal row0: [0,1,0] \u2192 becomes row1\n\nOriginal row1: [1,1,0] \u2192 becomes row2\n\nOriginal row2: [0,0,0] \u2192 discarded\n\nNew row0: [0,0,0]\n\nSo the output would be:\n\n[0,0,0]\n\n[0,1,0]\n\n[1,1,0]\n\nWhich matches the output. Similarly, Example3:\n\nInput:\n\n[0,2,2]\n\n[0,0,2]\n\n[0,0,0]\n\nShift down:\n\nRow0 \u2192 row1: [0,2,2]\n\nRow1 \u2192 row2: [0,0,2]\n\nRow2 is discarded. New row0 is 0s.\n\nSo output:\n\n[0,0,0]\n\n[0,2,2]\n\n[0,0,2]\n\nWhich matches the example.\n\nSo the pattern is: shift each existing row down by one position, discard the last (bottom) row, and add a new top row filled with zeros. So the transformation is shifting the rows down, pushing the bottom row out, and inserting a new zero row at the top.\n\nTesting this with the test input:\n\nTest Input:\n\n[0, 0, 0]\n\n[0, 1, 0]\n\n[0, 0, 0]\n\nApplying the pattern:\n\nShift each row down. Original row0 (all 0s) becomes row1. Original row1 ([0,1,0]) becomes row2. Original row2 (all 0s) is discarded. New row0 is all zeros.\n\nSo the output should be:\n\n[0,0,0]\n\n[0,0,0]\n\n[0,1,0]\n\nWait, but wait. Let's check again. Original rows:\n\nRow0: [0,0,0]\n\nRow1: [0,1,0]\n\nRow2: [0,0,0]\n\nAfter shifting down, row0 moves to row1, row1 to row2, row2 is discarded. So the new rows would be:\n\nNew row0: [0,0,0] (added)\n\nNew row1: original row0 \u2192 [0,0,0]\n\nNew row2: original row1 \u2192 [0,1,0]\n\nSo the output matrix is:\n\n[0,0,0]\n\n[0,0,0]\n\n[0,1,0]\n\nBut looking back at Example 2's input and output. The input was:\n\n[0,1,0]\n\n[1,1,0]\n\n[0,0,0]\n\nOutput after shifting: new row0 is 0s, row1 is original row0, row2 is original row1. So yes, same pattern. So the test input should produce:\n\n[0,0,0]\n\n[0,0,0]\n\n[0,1,0]\n\nBut wait, let me check if there's another possible pattern. For example, perhaps each row is shifted down, and the bottom row wraps around to the top. But in Example 0, that would make the third row (all zeros) move to the top. But in the output of Example0, the top row is zeros, which would fit. However, in Example1, shifting down would move row2 (all zeros) to the top. But the output of Example1's top row is zeros, which would fit. So maybe it's a circular shift. Let me check again.\n\nWait, if it's a circular shift, then in Example0:\n\nOriginal rows:\n\nRow0:1s\n\nRow1:0s\n\nRow2:0s\n\nShift down circularly:\n\nRow2 moves to row0, row0 to row1, row1 to row2. So new row0 is 0s, row1 is 1s, row2 is 0s. Which matches the output. Similarly, Example1:\n\nOriginal rows:\n\n0s, 1s, 0s\n\nCircular shift down:\n\nRow2 (0s) \u2192 row0\n\nRow0 (0s) \u2192 row1\n\nRow1 (1s) \u2192 row2\n\nSo output would be:\n\n[0,0,0]\n\n[0,0,0]\n\n[1,1,1]\n\nWhich matches the output. Oh, wait! So maybe the pattern is a circular shift where each element is shifted down, and the last row becomes the first. Wait, but in Example0, shifting down circularly would make the last row (0s) go to the top, and the other rows shift down. So:\n\nOriginal rows:\n\nRow0:1,1,1\n\nRow1:0,0,0\n\nRow2:0,0,0\n\nAfter circular shift down:\n\nRow2 becomes Row0 (0s)\n\nRow0 becomes Row1 (1s)\n\nRow1 becomes Row2 (0s)\n\nSo output rows:\n\nRow0:0s\n\nRow1:1s\n\nRow2:0s\n\nWhich matches the output. Similarly, Example1:\n\nOriginal rows:\n\nRow0:0s\n\nRow1:1s\n\nRow2:0s\n\nCircular shift down:\n\nRow2 (0s) \u2192 Row0\n\nRow0 (0s) \u2192 Row1\n\nRow1 (1s) \u2192 Row2\n\nSo output rows:\n\n0s, 0s, 1s \u2192 which matches.\n\nIn Example2:\n\nInput rows:\n\nRow0:0,1,0\n\nRow1:1,1,0\n\nRow2:0,0,0\n\nCircular shift down:\n\nRow2 (0s) \u2192 Row0\n\nRow0 \u2192 Row1\n\nRow1 \u2192 Row2\n\nSo output rows:\n\nRow0:0,0,0\n\nRow1:0,1,0\n\nRow2:1,1,0\n\nWhich matches the example.\n\nExample3:\n\nInput rows:\n\nRow0:0,2,2\n\nRow1:0,0,2\n\nRow2:0,0,0\n\nCircular shift down:\n\nRow2 \u2192 Row0 (0s)\n\nRow0 \u2192 Row1 (0,2,2)\n\nRow1 \u2192 Row2 (0,0,2)\n\nOutput:\n\n[0,0,0]\n\n[0,2,2]\n\n[0,0,2]\n\nWhich matches.\n\nSo the pattern is actually a circular shift where each row is shifted down by one, with the last row wrapping around to the top. But wait, in the training examples, the outputs don't have the last row wrapping. Wait, but according to the circular shift, the last row moves to the top, pushing all others down. Let me re-examine.\n\nIn a circular shift down, the last row becomes the first row, and the other rows shift down. For example:\n\nOriginal rows:\n\nA\n\nB\n\nC\n\nAfter circular shift down:\n\nC\n\nA\n\nB\n\nYes. So for example, in Example0:\n\nOriginal:\n\n[1,1,1]\n\n[0,0,0]\n\n[0,0,0]\n\nCircular shift down would take the last row [0,0,0] and put it first, then the first becomes second, etc. So:\n\nRow0: [0,0,0] (original row2)\n\nRow1: [1,1,1] (original row0)\n\nRow2: [0,0,0] (original row1)\n\nBut the output in Example0 is:\n\n[0,0,0]\n\n[1,1,1]\n\n[0,0,0]\n\nWhich matches. So yes, the circular shift down. So the pattern is that each row is shifted down by one in a circular manner. So the last row moves to the top, and the others shift down.\n\nWait, but then in Example3, after shifting:\n\nOriginal row2 (all 0s) becomes row0.\n\nOriginal row0 (0,2,2) becomes row1.\n\nOriginal row1 (0,0,2) becomes row2.\n\nSo output is:\n\n[0,0,0]\n\n[0,2,2]\n\n[0,0,2]\n\nWhich matches.\n\nSo the correct pattern is a circular down shift. So the transformation is a cyclic shift where each row is moved down by one, and the last row wraps around to the top.\n\nBut wait, in that case, the test input:\n\nTest Input:\n\n[0,0,0]\n\n[0,1,0]\n\n[0,0,0]\n\nApplying a circular shift down:\n\nOriginal rows:\n\nRow0: [0,0,0]\n\nRow1: [0,1,0]\n\nRow2: [0,0,0]\n\nAfter shifting, row2 becomes row0, row0 becomes row1, row1 becomes row2.\n\nSo output would be:\n\nRow0: [0,0,0] (original row2)\n\nRow1: [0,0,0] (original row0)\n\nRow2: [0,1,0] (original row1)\n\nSo the output is:\n\n[0,0,0]\n\n[0,0,0]\n\n[0,1,0]\n\nWhich is the expected answer.\n\nTherefore, the pattern is a circular down shift. So the output is generated by shifting each row down one position, with the last row wrapping around to the top."
