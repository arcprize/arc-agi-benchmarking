        "cot_1": "Okay, let's see. I need to figure out the pattern here. So the task is to take the input lists and transform them into the output lists. Let's look at the training examples first.\n\nStarting with Example 0. The input has three arrays. Let's look at the first one:\n\nInput: [1, 1, 2, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0]\nOutput: [1, 1, 2, 5, 4, 4, 1, 5, 1, 4, 4]\n\nHmm. The first four elements (1,1,2,5) are the same in input and output. Then the next three 0s become 4,4,1. Then after the 5, the next three 0s become 1,4,4. Wait, maybe the zeros are being replaced by some pattern related to the preceding numbers?\n\nLooking at the second input array in example 0: [4,1,1,5,0,0,0,5,0,0,0]. Output is [4,1,1,5,4,1,1,5,1,1,4]. So again, first four stay same. The three zeros after the first 5 become 4,1,1. Then after the next 5, the three zeros become 1,1,4.\n\nThird input array in example 0: [4,4,1,5,0,0,0,5,0,0,0]. Output becomes [4,4,1,5,1,1,2,5,2,1,1]. So the three zeros after first 5 become 1,1,2. Then after the next 5, zeros become 2,1,1.\n\nWait, maybe the three zeros are being replaced by elements from the first part of the array, but in some order. Let's look at the first input array in example 0: the first four are [1,1,2,5]. The three zeros become 4,4,1. But where do those numbers come from? Maybe from the previous arrays. Wait, the input has three arrays. So perhaps the transformation is combining elements from the same position in other arrays?\n\nWait, in example 0, the three input arrays are:\n\n1: [1,1,2,5,0,0,0,5,0,0,0]\n2: [4,1,1,5,0,0,0,5,0,0,0]\n3: [4,4,1,5,0,0,0,5,0,0,0]\n\nThe outputs are:\n\n1: [1,1,2,5,4,4,1,5,1,4,4]\n2: [4,1,1,5,4,1,1,5,1,1,4]\n3: [4,4,1,5,1,1,2,5,2,1,1]\n\nLooking at the first array's output, the three zeros after the first 5 (positions 4-6) become 4,4,1. If I look at the same positions in the other input arrays, maybe that's the case. For example, the first array's positions 4-6 are 0,0,0. But the second array's first three elements are 4,1,1, and the third array's first three are 4,4,1. Wait, the output for the first array's positions 4-6 is 4,4,1. That's the third array's first three elements. Then positions 8-10 in the first output array are 1,4,4. Looking at the second array's first three elements (4,1,1) and the third array's (4,4,1), maybe there's some rotation or combination here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each group of zeros is replaced by a portion from the previous arrays. Let's see example 1.\n\nExample 1 input arrays:\n\n[6,3,3,5,0,0,0,5,0,0,0]\n[6,3,3,5,0,0,0,5,0,0,0]\n[6,3,2,5,0,0,0,5,0,0,0]\n\nOutputs:\n\n[6,3,3,5,6,6,6,5,2,3,6]\n[6,3,3,5,3,3,3,5,3,3,6]\n[6,3,2,5,2,3,3,5,3,3,6]\n\nLooking at the first array's output, positions 4-6 are 6,6,6. The second array's positions 4-6 in input are 0,0,0, and in output they're 3,3,3. The third array's output positions 4-6 are 2,3,3. Hmm. Maybe each group of three zeros is replaced by some combination of elements from other arrays. For example, the first array's first three elements are 6,3,3. Maybe the first group of zeros (positions 4-6) in the first output array is filled with 6,6,6. That could be the first element of the first array (6) repeated three times. Similarly, in the second array's output, positions 4-6 are 3,3,3. The first element of the second array is 6, but maybe it's taking the second element, which is 3. The third array's positions 4-6 are 2,3,3. The first element is 6, but the third array's third element is 2. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the first output in example 1: the first three elements are 6,3,3, then 5. Then the next three zeros are replaced by 6,6,6. Then 5, then the next three zeros become 2,3,6. Where do 6,6,6 come from? Maybe the first element of the corresponding input array (6) repeated. Then the next group (positions 8-10) are 2,3,6. The original input's last three are 0,0,0. The first array's input's first three are 6,3,3, maybe reversed and modified? 3,3,6? But the output here is 2,3,6. Hmm. Maybe not.\n\nWait, in the third array of example 1's input: [6,3,2,5,0,0,0,5,0,0,0]. The output's positions 4-6 are 2,3,3. The original third array's elements 1-3 are 6,3,2. Maybe taking elements from different positions. Like 2 (third element), then 3 (second element), then 3 again. Not sure.\n\nAnother approach: perhaps each group of three zeros is replaced by elements from the other arrays in the same position. For example, in Example 0, the first array's positions 4-6 (originally zeros) are replaced by 4,4,1. Let's check the same positions in the other input arrays. The second input array's first three elements are 4,1,1. The third input array's first three are 4,4,1. So 4 (from the second array's first element), 4 (third array's first element), 1 (third array's second element?) Not sure. Alternatively, maybe the three zeros are replaced by the elements from the previous array's first three elements. Wait, in example 0, the first array's output positions 4-6 are 4,4,1. The third input array's first three elements are 4,4,1. So perhaps for the first array's zeros, they take the third array's first three elements. Then for the second array's zeros, maybe take another array's elements. Let's see.\n\nIn example 0's second array, the output positions 4-6 are 4,1,1. Which are the same as the first input array's first three elements (1,1,2) no. Wait, no. The first input array's first three are 1,1,2, but the output is 4,1,1. Hmm. The second input array's own first three are 4,1,1. So maybe when the array is the second one, it uses its own first three elements for the first group of zeros. Let's check:\n\nIn example 0's first array, the output's first group of zeros (positions 4-6) is 4,4,1. Which is the third array's first three elements (4,4,1). The second array's output positions 4-6 are 4,1,1, which are the same as its own first three elements (4,1,1). The third array's output positions 4-6 are 1,1,2. The first array's first three elements are 1,1,2. So perhaps each array's first group of zeros is replaced by the next array's first three elements. Like first array uses third array's elements, second array uses its own, third uses first array's? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each array's group of zeros is replaced by the first three elements of the next array in the list. For example, in example 0, the three input arrays are [array1, array2, array3]. Then array1's zeros are filled with array2's first three? But array1's output group is 4,4,1, which is array3's first three. Hmm. So perhaps it's the previous array? Like array1's group uses array3's elements. Maybe the order is cyclic. Let's see:\n\nIn example0:\n\n- Output array1's first group: 4,4,1 (array3's first three)\n- Output array2's first group: 4,1,1 (array2's own first three)\n- Output array3's first group: 1,1,2 (array1's first three)\nBut wait, array1's first three are 1,1,2, and array3's first three are 4,4,1. So maybe there's a rotation. For the first array, it takes the third array's elements, the second takes its own, the third takes the first's.\n\nBut then, what about the second group of zeros (positions 8-10)? Let's check example0's first array's output positions 8-10: 1,4,4. The second array's first three are 4,1,1. Third array's first three are 4,4,1. Maybe it's taking another rotation. For example, after the first 5, the first group is filled from the third array, then after the next 5, perhaps filled from the second array's first three elements? Let's see: the first array's second group is 1,4,4. The second array's first three are 4,1,1. Hmm, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each group of zeros is filled based on some pattern from the other arrays. Let's take example1's first input array:\n\nInput: [6,3,3,5,0,0,0,5,0,0,0]\nOutput: [6,3,3,5,6,6,6,5,2,3,6]\n\nPositions 4-6: 6,6,6. Maybe the first element (6) is repeated three times. Then positions 8-10: 2,3,6. The third input array in example1 is [6,3,2,5,0,0,0,5,0,0,0]. Its first three elements are 6,3,2. So the output for the first array's positions 8-10 is 2,3,6. Which is 2 (third element of third array), 3 (second element of third array), 6 (first element of third array). So reversed order of the third array's first three elements. Let's check if that holds elsewhere.\n\nIn example0's third array's second group of zeros (positions8-10) become 2,1,1. The third array's output for these positions is 2,1,1. If we look at the first array's first three elements (1,1,2), reversed would be 2,1,1. That matches. Similarly, in example1's third array's output, the second group of zeros (positions8-10) are 3,3,6. The third array's first three elements are 6,3,2. Reversed is 2,3,6, but the output here is 3,3,6. Hmm, that doesn't match. So maybe not reversed.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's taking the first three elements of the next array. For example, in example1's first array, the second group (positions8-10) is 2,3,6. The third array's first three are 6,3,2. If we take those elements in reverse order, it's 2,3,6. That matches. Then, the first group in example1's first array is 6,6,6. Which is the first element (6) repeated three times. So perhaps the first group is filled with the first element of the same array, and the second group is filled with the reversed first three elements of the next array.\n\nBut how does that apply to example0?\n\nIn example0's first array's first group (positions4-6) is 4,4,1. The first element of the first array is 1. But here, it's 4,4,1. So that doesn't fit. So maybe that's not the pattern.\n\nAnother angle: perhaps the first group of zeros (positions4-6) is replaced by elements from the same position in the other arrays. For example, in example0, the first array's positions4-6 are zeros. The output is 4,4,1. The second array's positions0-2 are 4,1,1. The third array's positions0-2 are 4,4,1. So maybe for each position in the first array's group, take the corresponding element from the other arrays. Like position4 in the first array's output is the first element of the second array (4), position5 is the first element of the third array (4), position6 is the second element of the third array (4)? Not exactly. Let's see:\n\nOutput positions4-6 for first array in example0: 4,4,1.\n\nLooking at the three input arrays:\n\nFirst array's first three: [1,1,2]\n\nSecond array's first three: [4,1,1]\n\nThird array's first three: [4,4,1]\n\nSo maybe:\n\nposition4 (first array's output) is second array's first element (4)\n\nposition5 is third array's first element (4)\n\nposition6 is third array's second element (4) \u2192 but output is 1. Hmm, that doesn't match.\n\nWait, position6 in the first array's output is 1. Third array's second element is 4, not 1. So maybe this approach isn't right.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the three zeros are replaced by combining elements from the three input arrays in some way. Let's see for example0, first array's group4-6: 4,4,1.\n\nThe three input arrays' first elements are 1,4,4. So 1 (first array), 4 (second), 4 (third). Then maybe sum? But 1+4+4=9, which is not 4. Not that.\n\nAlternatively, the first array's group is replaced by the third array's first three elements. Because 4,4,1 matches the third array's first three. Then the second array's group (positions4-6) is 4,1,1, which is the second array's own first three. The third array's group is 1,1,2, which is the first array's first three. So maybe it's a cyclic shift. First array uses third's first three, second uses own, third uses first's. Then, for the second group (positions8-10), maybe another shift.\n\nFor example0's first array's second group (positions8-10) is 1,4,4. The second array's first three are 4,1,1. Third array's first three are 4,4,1. So perhaps first array's second group uses the second array's first three. 4,1,1 \u2192 but output is 1,4,4. Not exactly. Hmm. Maybe reversed. 1,1,4 \u2192 reversed is 4,1,1. But output is 1,4,4. Not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the second group of zeros is filled using the previous array's first three. For example, first array's second group is filled with third array's first three, but reversed. Third array's first three are 4,4,1. Reversed is 1,4,4. Which matches the first array's second group (1,4,4). Yes! So that's possible.\n\nLet's check this for example0:\n\nFirst array's first group: third array's first three (4,4,1) \u2192 matches output.\n\nSecond array's first group: second array's own first three (4,1,1) \u2192 matches output.\n\nThird array's first group: first array's first three (1,1,2) \u2192 output is 1,1,2. Yes, matches.\n\nThen for the second group (positions8-10):\n\nFirst array's second group: third array's first three reversed (1,4,4). Because third array's first three are 4,4,1. Reversed gives 1,4,4. Which matches the output of 1,4,4.\n\nSecond array's second group: second array's own first three reversed (1,1,4). Reversed is 4,1,1. But the output for positions8-10 is 1,1,4. Hmm, that doesn't match. Wait, the output is [4,1,1,5,4,1,1,5,1,1,4]. So positions8-10 are 1,1,4. The reversed first three elements of second array (4,1,1) reversed is 1,1,4. Oh right! So reversed gives 1,1,4. Which matches the second array's second group.\n\nThird array's second group: first array's first three reversed (2,1,1). So first array's first three are 1,1,2. Reversed is 2,1,1. Which matches the third array's second group output: 2,1,1.\n\nThis seems to hold for example0. Let's check example1.\n\nExample1's first array's input first three: 6,3,3. The three input arrays are:\n\nArray1: [6,3,3,5,0,0,0,5,0,0,0]\n\nArray2: same as array1.\n\nArray3: [6,3,2,5,0,0,0,5,0,0,0]\n\nFirst array's first group (positions4-6) in output is 6,6,6. According to the pattern, first group is filled with third array's first three elements (6,3,2). But reversed would be 2,3,6. But output is 6,6,6. Hmm, this breaks the pattern. So maybe the pattern is different.\n\nWait, perhaps for the first group of zeros, it's taking the first array's own first element, and then something else. For example, in example1's first array, the first group is 6,6,6. Which is the first element (6) repeated three times. The second array's first group is 3,3,3. Which is the second element (3) of array2. Third array's first group is 2,3,3. Which is third array's third element (2) followed by third element (3) again?\n\nNot sure. Let's look for another approach.\n\nAlternative idea: The zeros are replaced by elements from the other arrays, but rotated. For example, in example0, the first array's first group of zeros is filled with the third array's first three elements. The second array's first group is filled with its own first three. The third array's first group is filled with the first array's first three. Then the second group of zeros is filled by reversing the first group's elements or using another array's elements.\n\nBut in example1, the first array's first group is filled with 6,6,6. Third array's first three are 6,3,2. So reversing gives 2,3,6, but the output is 6,6,6. So that doesn't fit. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the first group of zeros is filled by the first element of each array in the same position. For example, for the first array's group4-6, take the first elements of the three input arrays. Let's see:\n\nExample0's first array group4-6: 4,4,1. The first elements of the three input arrays are 1,4,4. So 1,4,4. But output is 4,4,1. Maybe it's reversed. 4,4,1 is reversed 1,4,4 \u2192 no. Wait, if the group is filled with the first elements of each array in order, but reversed. So 1,4,4 becomes 4,4,1. Which matches the output. Then, for the second array's group4-6: the first elements are 4,4,4 (since all three arrays have 4 in first position?), but the input arrays are array1:1, array2:4, array3:4. So first elements are 1,4,4. Reversed would be 4,4,1, but the output for array2's group4-6 is 4,1,1. Hmm, that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for each of the three positions in the group (positions4,5,6), they take the element from the corresponding array's position. For example, for array1's position4: take array2's position0 (4). Position5: array3's position0 (4). Position6: array1's position0 (1). So 4,4,1. Which matches example0's first array's group4-6. Then for array2's group4-6: position4 is array3's position0 (4), position5 is array1's position0 (1), position6 is array2's position0 (4). But output is 4,1,1. So that gives 4,1,4. Which doesn't match. So maybe not.\n\nAnother possibility: For the first group of zeros in each array, the three elements are the first element of the next array, then the first element of the third array, then something else. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, considering that the three input arrays are part of a set, maybe the replacement for the zeros in each array is derived from the other arrays in the group. For example, the first array's zeros are filled with elements from the second and third arrays.\n\nBut I'm getting stuck. Let's look at another example. Example2:\n\nInput arrays:\n\n[2,7,8,5,0,0,0,5,0,0,0]\n\n[7,7,8,5,0,0,0,5,0,0,0]\n\n[8,8,8,5,0,0,0,5,0,0,0]\n\nOutputs:\n\n[2,7,8,5,8,7,2,5,8,8,8]\n\n[7,7,8,5,8,7,7,5,8,7,7]\n\n[8,8,8,5,8,8,8,5,8,7,2]\n\nFirst array's first group (positions4-6):8,7,2. The other arrays' first three are 7,7,8 and 8,8,8. So 8 is from the third array's first element. 7 is from the second array's first element. 2 is from the first array's first element. 8,7,2. Then the second group (positions8-10) is 8,8,8, which is the third array's first three.\n\nSecond array's first group is 8,7,7. Third array's first three are 8,8,8. So maybe 8 (third array's first element), 7 (second array's second element?), 7 (second array's third element?). Not sure. Or perhaps the first group is filled with the third array's first three elements, then reversed. The third array's first three are 8,8,8. Reversed would be 8,8,8. But output is 8,7,7. Doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, the first group of zeros in the first array is filled with the third array's first three elements in reverse order. Third array's first three:8,8,8 \u2192 reversed is 8,8,8. But output is 8,7,2. Doesn't match.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the first group is filled with elements from other arrays in a specific pattern. For example, position4 is the third array's first element (8), position5 is the second array's first element (7), position6 is the first array's first element (2). Then 8,7,2. That matches the first array's first group. Then the second group (positions8-10) is filled with third array's first three elements (8,8,8). Which matches.\n\nFor the second array's first group: positions4-6 are 8,7,7. Third array's first element is 8 (position4), first array's second element is7 (position5), second array's third element is8 (position6) \u2192 8,7,8. But output is 8,7,7. Not matching. Alternatively, position6 takes the second array's third element (8) \u2192 8,7,8. No. Hmm.\n\nAnother idea: maybe each group of zeros is filled with the previous non-zero elements in the array, but modified. For example, the first array's group after the first 5: the previous elements are 2,7,8. Maybe some pattern with these. 2,7,8 \u2192 maybe reversed:8,7,2. Which matches the first array's first group. Then after the second 5, the previous elements are the group after the first 5. So the group after second 5 would be the reversed of the previous group. Or perhaps the third array's first three elements.\n\nWait, in example2's first array, the first group after 5 is 8,7,2, which is the reverse of the first three elements (2,7,8 \u2192 reversed is 8,7,2). Then the second group after the next 5 is 8,8,8, which is the third array's first three elements. So perhaps the first group is the reverse of the first three elements of the same array, and the second group is the first three elements of the third array.\n\nChecking for example0's first array: first three elements are 1,1,2. Reversed is 2,1,1. But the first group is 4,4,1. Doesn't fit. So that's not it.\n\nHmm. Let's think of another approach. Maybe the zeros are replaced by the sum of certain elements. For example, in example1's first array's first group is 6,6,6. The first three elements are 6,3,3. Sum of these is 12. Not directly relevant. Or maybe the product. 6*3*3=54. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the positions of the zeros. Each input array has two sets of three zeros. The first set after the first 5, the second after the second 5. The output replaces these zeros with some sequence. Maybe each group is replaced by a combination of elements from other parts of the input arrays.\n\nAlternatively, considering that the output arrays in the examples have elements that form some kind of mirror or symmetry. For example, in example0's first output array, the first group after 5 is 4,4,1, then after the second 5 it's 1,4,4. Which is a mirror image. Similarly, example1's first output array has 6,6,6 and then 2,3,6. Not a mirror. Example2's first output has 8,7,2 and then 8,8,8. Not mirrored.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the first group after 5 is filled with elements from the first three elements of the same array, but rotated. For example, example0's first array's first three elements are 1,1,2. Rotating them gives 1,2,1. Not matching the first group's 4,4,1. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps the key is that each group of three zeros is replaced by the first three elements of another array in the group, possibly with some transformation. For example:\n\nIn example0:\n\nFirst array's first group: third array's first three elements (4,4,1)\n\nSecond array's first group: own first three elements (4,1,1)\n\nThird array's first group: first array's first three elements (1,1,2)\n\nThen, for the second group:\n\nFirst array's second group: third array's first three elements reversed (1,4,4)\n\nSecond array's second group: own first three elements reversed (1,1,4)\n\nThird array's second group: first array's first three elements reversed (2,1,1)\n\nThis pattern holds for example0. Let's check example1.\n\nExample1's input arrays:\n\nArray1: [6,3,3,5,0,0,0,5,0,0,0]\n\nArray2: same as array1.\n\nArray3: [6,3,2,5,0,0,0,5,0,0,0]\n\nFirst array's first group in output:6,6,6. According to the pattern, this should be third array's first three elements (6,3,2) \u2192 but output is 6,6,6. Not matching. So maybe the pattern is different.\n\nWait, perhaps in example1, the first array's first group is filled with the first element of the third array (6) repeated three times. Third array's first element is 6. Then output is 6,6,6. For the second array's first group: own first three elements (6,3,3) \u2192 reversed or not? No, the output is3,3,3. Which is the second element (3) repeated three times. Third array's first group: third array's first three elements (6,3,2) reversed is 2,3,6. But the output is2,3,3. Hmm. Doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the first group is filled with the third array's first three elements, but modified. For example, example1's third array's first three are6,3,2. Output for first array's first group is6,6,6. Maybe the first element is taken three times. Then, the second array's first group is3,3,3. Which is the second element of the third array (3) repeated. Third array's first group is2,3,3. Which is the third element (2) followed by the third array's own second and third elements (3,2?), but not sure.\n\nThis seems inconsistent. Perhaps there's another pattern.\n\nLooking at the test input:\n\nTest input arrays are:\n\n[3,3,9,5,0,0,0,5,0,0,0]\n\n[9,9,9,5,0,0,0,5,0,0,0]\n\n[2,9,9,5,0,0,0,5,0,0,0]\n\nWe need to generate their outputs based on the pattern.\n\nAssuming that for each array's first group of zeros (positions4-6), it's filled with the third array's first three elements. Then the second group (positions8-10) is filled with the reversed third array's first three elements.\n\nWait, let's see example0:\n\nFirst array's first group: third array's first three (4,4,1). Second group: reversed third array's first three (1,4,4). Which matches.\n\nExample1's first array's first group is6,6,6. Third array's first three are6,3,2. But output is6,6,6. So maybe if the first array's first group is filled with the first element of the third array repeated three times. Then the second group would be the reversed third array's first three:2,3,6. Which matches the output for first array's second group (2,3,6).\n\nIn example1's third array's output, the first group is2,3,3. Third array's first three are6,3,2. So perhaps it's filled with the third element (2), then third array's second (3), then third array's second again (3). Not sure. But the second group is3,3,6. Which is the reversed third array's first three elements (2,3,6) \u2192 reversed gives6,3,2. Not matching. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, in example1's third array's output, the second group is3,3,6. Which could be the reversed first array's first three elements (3,3,6) \u2192 first array's first three are6,3,3. Reversed is3,3,6. Which matches the third array's second group output.\n\nSo the pattern seems to be:\n\nFor each array in the input group:\n\n- The first group of zeros (positions4-6) is filled with the first three elements of the next array in the list (with wrap around for the last array).\n\n- The second group of zeros (positions8-10) is filled with the first three elements of the previous array in the list (with wrap around), possibly reversed.\n\nLet's test this with example0.\n\nExample0 has three arrays:\n\narray0: [1,1,2,5,0,0,0,5,0,0,0]\n\narray1: [4,1,1,5,0,0,0,5,0,0,0]\n\narray2: [4,4,1,5,0,0,0,5,0,0,0]\n\narray0's first group is filled with next array (array1) first three:4,1,1. But the output for array0's first group is4,4,1. Which doesn't match. So maybe not.\n\nAlternative approach: the first group of zeros is filled with the first three elements of the array that is two positions ahead. For example, in example0's array0, the next two arrays are array1 and array2. So array0's first group is filled with array2's first three elements (4,4,1). Which matches the output. Then array1's first group is filled with array2's first three elements (4,4,1), but array1's first group output is4,1,1. Hmm, no. Doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, for array0's first group, filled with array2's first three elements. For array1's first group, filled with array0's first three. For array2's first group, filled with array1's first three. But array1's output first group is4,1,1, which is array1's own first three. So this doesn't fit.\n\nThis is getting too time-consuming. Maybe I should look for another approach. Perhaps each group of three zeros is replaced by the first three elements of the same array, but modified.\n\nFor example, in example0's first array:\n\nFirst three elements are1,1,2. The first group of zeros is replaced with4,4,1. Which is not directly related. But if we consider that the numbers are increasing or some mathematical operation. 1+3=4, 1+3=4, 2+(-1)=1. Not consistent.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each zero is replaced by the sum of the previous elements. For example, in the first array, after the first 5, the zeros become 4,4,1. Maybe the sum of the first three elements:1+1+2=4. Then 4,4,1. But why 4,4,1?\n\nAlternatively, the first group is filled with the first three elements of the other arrays in some order. For example, the first array's group is filled with array2's first element, array3's first element, array1's first element. So 4,4,1. Which matches example0's first array's group.\n\nThe second array's group is filled with array3's first, array1's first, array2's first. 4,1,4. But the output is4,1,1. So no.\n\nAlternatively, for each array, the first group is filled with the first elements of all three arrays. For example, first array's group is filled with array1's first, array2's first, array3's first. Which would be1,4,4. But output is4,4,1. So maybe reversed.\n\nIn example0's first array's group is4,4,1. Which is array2's first (4), array3's first (4), array1's first (1). So 4,4,1. That matches.\n\nThen for the second array's group: array3's first (4), array1's first (1), array2's first (4). Output is4,1,1. Doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. This seems like a possible pattern for the first group. For each array's first group, take the first elements of the other two arrays and then its own first element. But example0's first array's group is4 (array2's first),4 (array3's first),1 (array1's first). So array2, array3, array1.\n\nFor example1's first array's group:6,6,6. The other arrays are array2 and array3. Their first elements are6 and6. So array2's first is6, array3's first is6, array1's first is6. So6,6,6. Which matches.\n\nExample2's first array's group:8,7,2. The other arrays' first elements are7 (array2) and8 (array3). array1's own first is2. So array2's first (7), array3's first (8), array1's first (2). But output is8,7,2. So the order would be array3, array2, array1. Yes, array3's first is8, array2's first is7, array1's first is2. 8,7,2. Which matches.\n\nSo the pattern for the first group (positions4-6) seems to be:\n\nTake the first elements of the third array, second array, and first array, in that order.\n\nSo for each array in the input group, the first group of zeros is filled with:\n\nthird array's first element, second array's first element, first array's first element.\n\nLet's check this with example0's first array:\n\nthird array's first element is4 (array2?), wait wait example0 has three input arrays. Wait, example0's input is three arrays: array0, array1, array2. So for array0's first group, third array is array2. So array2's first element is4, array1's first element is4, array0's first element is1. So the first group would be4,4,1. Which matches.\n\nFor array1's first group (example0's second array):\n\nthird array's first element is array2's first (4), second array's first is array1's own first (4?), wait no. Wait, in example0, the arrays are:\n\narray0: [1,1,2,5,0,0,0,5,0,0,0]\n\narray1: [4,1,1,5,0,0,0,5,0,0,0]\n\narray2: [4,4,1,5,0,0,0,5,0,0,0]\n\nFor array1's first group, third array is array2's first element (4), second array is array1's own first (4?), and first array is array0's first (1). So 4 (third array),4 (second array),1 (first array). But array1's first group output is4,1,1. So this doesn't fit.\n\nHmm, maybe the pattern is different. Let's re-examine:\n\nIn example0's array0's first group is4,4,1. Which is array2's first (4), array1's first (4), array0's first (1). But output is4,4,1. So order is third array, second array, first array.\n\nFor array1's first group, according to this pattern, third array is array0's first (1), second array is array1's own first (4), first array is array2's first (4). So order would be 1,4,4. But the output is4,1,1. Doesn't match.\n\nSo this approach isn't correct.\n\nAlternative idea: perhaps the first group is filled with the first elements of all three arrays in the order of array3, array2, array1. For example, in example0's array0's first group: array2's first (4), array1's first (4), array0's first (1) \u2192 4,4,1. Which matches.\n\nIn example1's array0's first group: array3's first (6), array2's first (6), array1's first (6) \u21926,6,6. Which matches.\n\nIn example2's array0's first group: array3's first (8), array2's first (7), array1's first (2) \u21928,7,2. Which matches.\n\nThen, for array1's first group in example0:\n\narray3's first (array2's first is4), array2's first (array1's first is4), array1's own first (4). So third array is array2's first (4), second array is array1's own first (4), first array is array0's first (1). So 4,4,1. But the output is4,1,1. Hmm, no.\n\nWait, maybe the pattern is that each array's first group is filled with the third array's first element, then the second array's first element, then the first array's first element, regardless of which array we're processing. But that doesn't make sense because each array in the input group is being processed individually.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the first group is filled with the first elements of the three arrays in reverse order. For example, for example0's array0's first group: array0's first (1), array1's first (4), array2's first (4) \u2192 reversed order is array2, array1, array0 \u21924,4,1. Which matches.\n\nSimilarly, example1's array0's first group: array0's first (6), array1's first (6), array2's first (6) \u2192 reversed order is6,6,6. Which matches.\n\nExample2's array0's first group: array0's first (2), array1's first (7), array2's first (8) \u2192 reversed order is8,7,2. Which matches.\n\nSo the pattern for the first group (positions4-6) is to take the first elements of all three input arrays, reverse their order, and fill them into the zeros. For example:\n\narray0's first group: [array2_first, array1_first, array0_first]\n\nSimilarly, array1's first group would be [array2_first, array1_first, array0_first]? But wait, no. Let's check example0's array1's first group output:4,1,1.\n\n array2's first is4, array1's first is4, array0's first is1. Reversed order is1,4,4. But the output is4,1,1. Doesn't match.\n\nWait, this only works for the first array in each example. Hmm.\n\nAnother angle: perhaps for each array's first group, the three elements are the first elements of the other two arrays and then its own first element, but ordered in some way.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the first group of each array is filled with the first elements of all three arrays, but ordered based on the array's position. For example, array0's first group is [array2_first, array1_first, array0_first], array1's is [array0_first, array2_first, array1_first], etc. But this requires a specific rotation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each array's first group is filled with the first elements of the three arrays, sorted in descending order. For example, example0's array0's first elements are1,4,4 \u2192 sorted descending gives4,4,1. Which matches the output. array1's first elements are4,4,1 \u2192 sorted descending 4,4,1. Output for array1's first group is4,1,1. Doesn't match.\n\nNo. So this isn't the case.\n\nBut in example0's array0's first group output is4,4,1, which is sorted descending (4,4,1). array1's output is4,1,1. So sorted would be4,1,1. But the input first elements are4,4,1. Wait, array1's own first element is4, array0's is1, array2's is4. So sorted descending is4,4,1. But output is4,1,1. Doesn't fit.\n\nAnother observation: in the examples, the first group of each array's output seems to have elements that are the same as the first elements of the other arrays. For example, example0's first array's first group is4,4,1. Which are the first elements of array2 (4), array1 (4), and array0 (1).\n\nSimilarly, example1's first array's first group is6,6,6. The first elements of all three arrays are6,6,6.\n\nExample2's first array's first group is8,7,2. Which are the first elements of array3 (8), array2 (7), array1 (2). \n\nAh! So the pattern is that for each array in the input group, the first group of zeros (positions4-6) is filled with the first elements of the three arrays in reverse order of their array indices. For example:\n\n- The first array (index0) in the input group uses the third array's first element, then the second array's first element, then the first array's own first element.\n\n- The second array (index1) uses the third array's first element, then the first array's first element, then the second array's own first element.\n\n- The third array (index2) uses the second array's first element, then the first array's first element, then the third array's own first element.\n\nWait, let's check example0:\n\narray0's first group: third array's first (4), second array's first (4), array0's own first (1). Output:4,4,1. Correct.\n\narray1's first group: third array's first (4), array0's first (1), array1's own first (4). Output:4,1,1. Hmm, no. The output is4,1,1, but according to this, it should be4,1,4. So that's not matching.\n\nAnother possibility: For each array i, the first group is filled with the first elements of the arrays in the order i-1, i, i+1 (mod 3). For example, array0 would use array2's first, array0's own first, array1's first. So for example0's array0:4,1,4. But output is4,4,1. No.\n\nAlternatively, it's i+1, i, i-1. For array0:1's first (array1 is4), array0's 1, array2's4. So4,1,4. No.\n\nAlternatively, for each array, the first group is filled with the first elements of the next array, then current array's, then previous array's.\n\nFor example0's array0: next array is array1 (4), current array's first (1), previous array is array2 (4) \u2192 but previous array for array0 would be array2 (since it's cyclical). So 4,1,4. Not matching the output4,4,1.\n\nThis is getting frustrating. Let's try to focus on the test input and see if I can derive the pattern from there.\n\nTest input arrays are:\n\narray0: [3,3,9,5,0,0,0,5,0,0,0]\n\narray1: [9,9,9,5,0,0,0,5,0,0,0]\n\narray2: [2,9,9,5,0,0,0,5,0,0,0]\n\nExpected outputs based on the pattern.\n\nIf the pattern for the first group is to take the third array's first element, then second array's first, then first array's first.\n\nFor array0's first group:\n\nthird array (array2) first element:2\n\nsecond array (array1) first element:9\n\nfirst array's own first:3\n\nSo first group would be2,9,3. But looking at the training examples, maybe it's reverse order. For example, array0's first group is third array's first, second array's first, first array's first. So 2,9,3. But according to example2's first array's first group, which was8,7,2 (third array's first, second array's first, first array's first), then yes.\n\nSo for test input array0's first group:2,9,3. But let's check the training examples to see if this makes sense.\n\nIn example2's array0's first group was8,7,2. Third array's first is8, second array's first is7, first array's first is2. So yes, same pattern.\n\nSo for test input array0's first group (positions4-6):2,9,3.\n\nThen the second group (positions8-10) would be filled with the first three elements of the previous array in the group, reversed.\n\nFor example, in example0's array0's second group was1,4,4, which is array2's first three elements (4,4,1) reversed. \n\nIn example2's array0's second group is8,8,8, which is array3's first three elements (8,8,8) reversed, but it's the same.\n\nSo for test input array0's second group (positions8-10):\n\nPrevious array is array2. array2's first three elements are2,9,9. Reversed is9,9,2. So the second group would be9,9,2.\n\nSo array0's output would be:\n\n[3,3,9,5,2,9,3,5,9,9,2]\n\nBut let's check if this aligns with the training examples.\n\nIn example0's array0, first group is third array's first three elements (4,4,1) \u2192 first elements of each array in reverse order (array2's, array1's, array0's). Second group is array2's first three elements reversed (1,4,4). So for test input array0's second group, array2's first three elements are2,9,9 \u2192 reversed is9,9,2.\n\nYes. So array0's output would be:\n\n[3,3,9,5,2,9,3,5,9,9,2]\n\nBut wait, example0's array0's first group is filled with third array's first three elements (4,4,1), but in the output it's 4,4,1. So first group is third array's first three elements. But in our test input, array0's first group would be filled with array2's first three elements (2,9,9). Wait, no. Wait, the first group is filled with the first elements of the three arrays in reverse order. Like array2's first element, array1's first element, array0's first element.\n\nSo for test input array0's first group:\n\narray2's first element is2, array1's is9, array0's is3. So group is2,9,3.\n\nThen, the second group is array2's first three elements (2,9,9) reversed:9,9,2.\n\nSo array0's output would be:\n\n[3,3,9,5,2,9,3,5,9,9,2]\n\nSimilarly, array1's first group would be array2's first element (2), array0's first element (3), array1's own first element (9). So2,3,9. Then, the second group is array0's first three elements (3,3,9) reversed:9,3,3.\n\nSo array1's output would be:\n\n[9,9,9,5,2,3,9,5,9,3,3]\n\nBut let's look at example1's array1. Its first group is3,3,3. Which is the first elements of the three arrays (6,6,6) reversed? No. Example1's array1's first three elements are6,3,3, but the output for first group is3,3,3. Which is the second element repeated three times. Hmm, this contradicts the previous pattern.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the second group is filled with the reversed first three elements of the same array. For example, in example0's array0, the first three are1,1,2. Reversed is2,1,1. The second group is1,4,4. Not matching.\n\nThis is getting too inconsistent. Let's try to focus on the test input and see what the possible outputs could be.\n\nTest input array0: [3,3,9,5,0,0,0,5,0,0,0]\n\nFollowing example0's pattern, the first group of zeros is filled with the third array's first three elements. Third array is [2,9,9,5,...], so first three are2,9,9. So first group becomes2,9,9. But example0's first array's first group was filled with the third array's first three elements (4,4,1) \u2192 which matches. But in example0's first array's output, the first group is4,4,1. So for test array0's first group:2,9,9.\n\nThen the second group of zeros is filled with the third array's first three elements reversed:9,9,2.\n\nSo array0's output would be:\n\n[3,3,9,5,2,9,9,5,9,9,2]\n\nBut looking at example2's first array's first group, which is the third array's first elements, followed by the second array's first, then the first array's first. So example2's first array's first group is8,7,2, which are third array's first (8), second array's first (7), first array's first (2). So applying that to test array0:\n\nthird array's first (2), second array's first (9), first array's first (3) \u21922,9,3.\n\nSo first group is2,9,3.\n\nThen the second group would be third array's first three elements reversed:9,9,2.\n\nSo array0's output becomes [3,3,9,5,2,9,3,5,9,9,2]\n\nSimilarly for array1: [9,9,9,5,0,0,0,5,0,0,0]\n\nFirst group: third array's first (2), second array's own first (9), first array's first (3). So 2,9,3. But array1's own first is9. Hmm, this is conflicting.\n\nWait, according to the pattern observed in example2's array1's output, the first group is filled with third array's first, second array's first, first array's first. So for array1 in test input:\n\nthird array is array2: first element is2.\n\nsecond array is array1: first element is9.\n\nfirst array is array0: first element is3.\n\nSo first group is2,9,3. But array1's own first element is9. So why would it use array0's first element?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the pattern is that for each array, the first group is filled with the first elements of the next array, previous array, and current array. Not sure.\n\nAnother approach: look at the output for example1's first array:\n\nInput arrays:\n\narray0: [6,3,3,5,0,0,0,5,0,0,0]\n\narray1: [6,3,3,5,0,0,0,5,0,0,0]\n\narray2: [6,3,2,5,0,0,0,5,0,0,0]\n\nOutput array0's first group:6,6,6. So all elements are the first element of array0. Then second group:2,3,6, which is array2's first three elements reversed (2,3,6).\n\nSo maybe the first group is filled with the first element of the same array, repeated three times. And the second group is filled with the third array's first three elements reversed.\n\nIf that's the case, then for test input array0's first group would be3,3,3, and second group array2's first three reversed:9,9,2.\n\nSo array0's output would be:\n\n[3,3,9,5,3,3,3,5,9,9,2]\n\nBut example2's first array's first group is8,7,2, which isn't repeated first element. So this pattern doesn't hold.\n\nThis is really challenging. Let's try to find a different pattern.\n\nLooking at example0's output arrays:\n\nEach output array's elements after the first 5 and the next 5 are combinations of the other arrays' elements. For example, the first output array's groups after 5s are 4,4,1 and 1,4,4. These look like they're related to the third array's first three elements (4,4,1) and then reversed.\n\nSimilarly, example1's first output array's groups are6,6,6 and2,3,6. The third array's first three elements are6,3,2. Reversed gives2,3,6. So the second group is reversed third array's first three.\n\nExample2's first output array's groups are8,7,2 and8,8,8. Third array's first three are8,8,8. Reversed is same.\n\nSo the pattern seems to be:\n\n- For each array in the input group:\n\n   - The first group of zeros (positions4-6) is filled with the third array's first three elements.\n\n   - The second group of zeros (positions8-10) is filled with the third array's first three elements reversed.\n\nBut wait, example0's first array's first group is third array's first three elements (4,4,1), second group is third array's first three reversed (1,4,4).\n\nYes, matches.\n\nExample1's first array's first group is third array's first three (6,3,2), reversed would be2,3,6. But output first group is6,6,6. So that doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. Unless there's a different rule for the first group.\n\nWait, example1's third array's first three are6,3,2. So the first array's first group is6,6,6. Which doesn't match third array's elements. So this theory is invalid.\n\nAlternative idea: maybe the first group is filled with the first array's first three elements, and the second group with the third array's first three elements reversed.\n\nBut example0's first array's first group is4,4,1, which isn't the first array's first three.\n\nAnother approach: look at the positions of the output arrays. Each output array has the same structure: the first four elements are same as input, then three elements, then 5, then three elements.\n\nLooking at the outputs, after each 5, the next three elements seem to be derived from the other arrays.\n\nIn example0's first array's output, after the first 5:4,4,1 (third array's first three), after the second 5:1,4,4 (third array's first three reversed).\n\nExample1's first array's output after first 5:6,6,6 (first array's first element repeated), after second 5:2,3,6 (third array's first three reversed).\n\nExample2's first array's output after first 5:8,7,2 (third array's first element, second array's first, first array's first), after second 5:8,8,8 (third array's first three).\n\nSo perhaps the first group after 5 is filled with the third array's first three elements, and the second group after 5 is filled with the third array's first three elements reversed.\n\nBut example0's second group is reversed third array's first three elements. Example1's second group is reversed third array's first three elements. Example2's second group is third array's first three elements (which are already 8,8,8).\n\nSo this seems to hold.\n\nTesting this:\n\nFor example0's first array:\n\nThird array's first three:4,4,1. First group:4,4,1. Second group reversed:1,4,4.\n\nYes.\n\nExample1's first array:\n\nThird array's first three:6,3,2. First group should be6,3,2. But output is6,6,6. So doesn't fit. Unless there's an exception.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the first group is filled with the first array's first three elements, and the second group with reversed third array's first three. But example0's first array's first group isn't first array's first three.\n\nThis is really tough. Given the time I've spent, I'll proceed with the pattern that for each array:\n\n- The first group after 5 (positions4-6) is filled with the third array's first three elements.\n\n- The second group after 5 (positions8-10) is filled with the third array's first three elements reversed.\n\nApplying this to the test input:\n\nTest input arrays:\n\narray0: [3,3,9,5,0,0,0,5,0,0,0]\n\narray1: [9,9,9,5,0,0,0,5,0,0,0]\n\narray2: [2,9,9,5,0,0,0,5,0,0,0]\n\nFor each array's output:\n\nFor array0:\n\nThird array is array2. array2's first three elements:2,9,9.\n\nFirst group (positions4-6):2,9,9.\n\nSecond group (positions8-10): reversed(2,9,9) \u21929,9,2.\n\nSo array0's output: [3,3,9,5,2,9,9,5,9,9,2]\n\nFor array1:\n\nThird array is array2. Same as above.\n\nFirst group:2,9,9.\n\nReversed:9,9,2.\n\nSo array1's output: [9,9,9,5,2,9,9,5,9,9,2]\n\nWait, but in the training examples, each array's output depends on their own position. For example, in example0's array1, the third array is array2, so first group is4,4,1. But array1's output first group is4,1,1. So this approach doesn't hold.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for each array, the third array is the next array in the list. For example, array0 uses array1 as the third array, array1 uses array2, array2 uses array0.\n\nWait, maybe the third array is the next array in the list. For example, for array0, the third array is array1. For array1, it's array2. For array2, it's array0.\n\nLet's apply this to example0:\n\n array0's third array is array1. array1's first three are4,1,1. So first group would be4,1,1. But example0's array0's output first group is4,4,1. Doesn't fit.\n\nThis is not working. Given the time I've spent, I'll proceed with the initial assumption for the test input based on example2's pattern.\n\nTest input array0's first group: third array's first three elements (2,9,9), reversed second group (9,9,2).\n\n array0 output: [3,3,9,5,2,9,9,5,9,9,2]\n\n array1's first group: third array's first three (2,9,9), reversed (9,9,2). So array1 output: [9,9,9,5,2,9,9,5,9,9,2]\n\n array2's first group: third array's first three elements (assuming array0 is the third array for array2?), but array2 is the third array. So if the third array for array2 is array0, then first three elements are3,3,9. So first group would be3,3,9. Reversed second group is9,3,3.\n\n array2's output: [2,9,9,5,3,3,9,5,9,3,3]\n\nBut looking at the training examples, each array's output first group is derived from the third array's first elements. For example, example2's array0's first group is third array's first three (8,8,8), but output is8,7,2. So that contradicts.\n\nGiven the time I've spent, I'll settle on the following answer based on the pattern observed in example0 and example2, where the first group is filled with the first elements of the third array, second array, and first array, and the second group is the reversed third array's first three elements.",

        "cot_2": "Okay, let's tackle this puzzle. So, the task is to figure out the pattern that transforms the input lists into the output lists based on the training examples. Then apply that pattern to the test input. Let's start by looking at the examples closely.\n\nFirst, looking at Example 0. The input arrays have some zeros in positions 4-6 and 8-10. The outputs replace these zeros with certain numbers. Let's compare each input row to its output.\n\nFor the first input in Example 0:\nInput: [1, 1, 2, 5, 0,0,0,5,0,0,0]\nOutput: [1,1,2,5,4,4,1,5,1,4,4]\nSo the zeros in positions 4-6 (indices 4,5,6) are replaced with 4,4,1. Then the zeros after the second 5 (positions 8-10) become 1,4,4.\n\nHmm. What's the source of these numbers? Let's check the other rows. \n\nThe second input in Example 0 is [4,1,1,5,...] and the output's 4-6 are 4,1,1. Then positions 8-10 are 1,1,4.\n\nThird input: [4,4,1,5,...] becomes 1,1,2 in positions 4-6, and 2,1,1 in 8-10.\n\nLooking for a pattern here. Maybe the replacement numbers come from previous elements in the same array or across the arrays. Let's see.\n\nIn the first example's first row input, the elements before the first 5 are 1,1,2. The output's 4-6 are 4,4,1. Wait, where do 4,4,1 come from? Maybe looking at the next rows. The second row's input is [4,1,1,5,...], and its output's 4-6 are 4,1,1. The third row's input is [4,4,1,5,...], and output's 4-6 are 1,1,2. Hmm, maybe there's a relationship between the elements before the first 5 and the replacement numbers.\n\nWait, in Example 0's outputs:\n\nFirst output's 4-6: 4,4,1. The second input row's first four elements are 4,1,1,5. So maybe the replacement is taken from the next row's elements. For example, the first row's zeros are replaced with the second row's first three elements (4,1,1) but then modified? Wait the first output's 4-6 is 4,4,1. The second row's first three elements are 4,1,1. Hmm, maybe the first row's zeros are replaced with the second row's first three elements but shifted or altered. But then the third row's input is [4,4,1,5,...] and its output's 4-6 is 1,1,2. The next row's first elements would be the next input row, but there are only three rows. Maybe the replacement is based on the same row's elements.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each group of zeros is replaced with the previous elements in some way. Let's take the first row of Example 0's input: [1,1,2,5,0,0,0,5,0,0,0]. The output replaces the first three zeros (positions 4-6) with 4,4,1. Then after the second 5, positions 8-10 are 1,4,4. Wait, the 4,4,1 and 1,4,4... Maybe these are reversed or some combination of previous elements. Let's check the elements before the first 5 in the input: 1,1,2. But how do those lead to 4,4,1?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the zeros are replaced by elements from the other input rows. Let's look at the inputs for Example 0. The three input rows are:\n\nRow0: [1,1,2,5,0,0,0,5,0,0,0]\nRow1: [4,1,1,5,0,0,0,5,0,0,0]\nRow2: [4,4,1,5,0,0,0,5,0,0,0]\n\nThe outputs are:\n\nRow0: [1,1,2,5,4,4,1,5,1,4,4]\nRow1: [4,1,1,5,4,1,1,5,1,1,4]\nRow2: [4,4,1,5,1,1,2,5,2,1,1]\n\nLooking at Row0's output, the 4,4,1 in positions 4-6 correspond to Row1's first three elements (4,1,1) but the first two elements are 4,4. Wait, no. Row1's first three elements are 4,1,1. So 4,1,1. But Row0's output there is 4,4,1. Hmm, not matching exactly.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each output row's zeros are filled with elements from the next row's input. For example, Row0's first zeros are filled with elements from Row1's input. Let's check:\n\nRow0's first zero block (positions4-6): 4,4,1. Row1's input starts with 4,1,1. So maybe first element from Row1's first element (4), then next elements from Row2? Not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's a combination of the next row's elements. For Row0's first zero block: 4,4,1. The next row (Row1) starts with 4,1,1,5. Maybe the first element is 4, then next two from Row2? Row2 starts with 4,4,1. So 4,4,1. That would explain 4,4,1. Then for Row1's first zero block (positions4-6: 4,1,1), which matches Row1's own first three elements. Then Row2's zero block becomes 1,1,2. Which is the next row's elements? But there is no next row. Or maybe the first zero block is filled with the next row's elements. So Row0's zero block is filled with Row1's first three elements. Then Row1's zero block is filled with Row2's first three elements. Then Row2's zero block is filled with Row0's first three elements? Let's check:\n\nRow0's zero block (positions4-6) becomes 4,4,1. Row1's first three elements are 4,1,1. But 4,4,1 is different. Hmm, maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each zero block is filled with the first three elements of the previous row. For example, Row0's first zero block is filled with the previous row (Row2?) but in Example 0 there are three rows. Or perhaps the previous row in the input list. So Row0's zero block is filled with Row1's first three elements. Let's see:\n\nRow0's output first zero block is 4,4,1. Row1's input starts with 4,1,1. That doesn't match. Wait, but maybe modified. Or perhaps the elements are taken from the next row's input. Row0's next row is Row1, which starts with 4,1,1. Then Row0's first zero block is 4,4,1. How does 4,1,1 become 4,4,1? Maybe it's the same as the next row's first element, then next two elements from another source. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the output for the first zero block in each example's rows:\n\nIn Example 0's output:\n\nRow0's first zero block: 4,4,1. The input rows for the other rows have first elements 4 (Row1) and 4 (Row2). So maybe it's a combination. Alternatively, perhaps each zero block is filled with the elements from the same position in the next row. For example, the first zero block in Row0 (positions4-6) is filled with the first three elements of Row1's input. Let's check:\n\nRow1's input first three: 4,1,1. So 4,1,1. But Row0's output here is 4,4,1. That doesn't match. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the zero blocks are being filled by some calculation based on the elements before the 5. For example, the first three elements in each row (before the 5) are transformed into the numbers that replace the zeros. Let's look at Example 0's first row:\n\nInput first three elements: 1,1,2. Output first zero block:4,4,1. How to get from 1,1,2 to 4,4,1? Maybe sum: 1+1+2=4. Then 4, then 1? Not sure. Alternatively, maybe some rotation or reverse. 1,1,2 reversed is 2,1,1. Doesn't match. Multiply each element by something? 1*4=4, 1*4=4, 2*0.5=1. Not obvious.\n\nWait, looking at the first row's output, the first zero block is 4,4,1. The second zero block (after the second 5) is 1,4,4. Which is the reverse of the first block. So 4,4,1 reversed is 1,4,4. But why the first block is 4,4,1? Let's see if that holds for other examples.\n\nLooking at Example 1:\n\nFirst input row is [6,3,3,5,0,0,0,5,0,0,0]. The output first zero block is 6,6,6. The second zero block is 2,3,6. Hmm, reversed would be 6,3,2. Not matching. So maybe that's not the pattern.\n\nAlternatively, in Example 0, the first zero block is 4,4,1. The second zero block is 1,4,4. Which is the reverse. Similarly, in Example 1's first row, the first zero block is 6,6,6 and the second is 2,3,6. Not reversed, but 6,6,6 reversed is the same. The second zero block is 2,3,6. Not sure.\n\nLet's look at the third example in Example 0. The first zero block becomes 1,1,2. The second zero block is 2,1,1. Again, reverse. So maybe the pattern is that each zero block is filled with some transformation of the elements before the first 5, and then the second block is the reverse of the first.\n\nSo for the first row in Example 0:\n\nInput before 5: [1,1,2]. The first zero block is [4,4,1]. How to get that from [1,1,2]? Maybe sum the numbers. 1+1+2=4. Then 4,4,1. Not sure. Alternatively, maybe the elements are transformed by adding 3 to each: 1+3=4, 1+3=4, 2-1=1. But that seems arbitrary.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the first zero block is the elements from the same row in a different order. For example, in Example 0's first row, the elements before 5 are 1,1,2. The zero block is 4,4,1. Not sure.\n\nAnother approach: looking at the positions of the zeros. Each input has two blocks of three zeros each. The output replaces them with some numbers. Let's compare the positions.\n\nIn Example 0:\n\nFirst row's output after the first 5: 4,4,1 (positions4-6), then after the second 5:1,4,4 (positions8-10). So reversed.\n\nSecond row's output after first 5:4,1,1 \u2192 reversed is 1,1,4 (positions8-10).\n\nThird row's output after first5:1,1,2 \u2192 reversed 2,1,1 (positions8-10).\n\nSo the pattern for the zero blocks seems to be that the first block is filled with certain values, and the second block is the reverse of the first block.\n\nNow, how are the first blocks filled?\n\nLooking at Example 0's first row: input starts with [1,1,2,5...], and the first block is [4,4,1]. How is this derived?\n\nLooking at the other rows in the same example's input:\n\nSecond row starts with [4,1,1,5...], and the first block in output is [4,1,1]. Third row input starts with [4,4,1,5...], output first block [1,1,2]. Wait, maybe the first block is the sum of the previous rows' first elements? For example:\n\nRow0's first block: 4,4,1. The sum of Row1's first elements (4+1+1=6?) Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the first block in each row is the same as the next row's first three elements. For Example 0:\n\nRow0's first block is 4,4,1. The next row (Row1) in input starts with 4,1,1. So maybe Row0's first block is the next row's first three elements modified. 4,1,1 \u2192 4,4,1. Maybe the second element is repeated. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the first block is a combination of elements from the other rows. For example, Row0's first block is [4,4,1], which could be the first element from Row1 (4), the first element from Row2 (4), and the third element from Row1 (1). That would give 4,4,1. Then the second block is the reverse. Similarly, Row1's first block is [4,1,1], which could be Row2's first three elements (4,4,1) \u2192 but 4,4,1 modified to 4,1,1? Maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, looking at all three rows' inputs and outputs:\n\nExample 0's input rows:\n\nRow0: [1,1,2,5,0,0,0,5,0,0,0]\nRow1: [4,1,1,5,0,0,0,5,0,0,0]\nRow2: [4,4,1,5,0,0,0,5,0,0,0]\n\nOutputs:\n\nRow0: [1,1,2,5,4,4,1,5,1,4,4]\nRow1: [4,1,1,5,4,1,1,5,1,1,4]\nRow2: [4,4,1,5,1,1,2,5,2,1,1]\n\nNoticing that the first three elements of the output rows are the same as the input rows. Then after the first 5, the first zero block is filled, and after the second 5, the second zero block is filled.\n\nFor the first zero block:\n\nRow0's first block: 4,4,1 \u2192 same as Row1's first element (4), Row2's first element (4), and Row1's third element (1). Maybe.\n\nRow1's first block:4,1,1 \u2192 Row1's own first three elements (4,1,1). So same as input.\n\nRow2's first block:1,1,2 \u2192 sum of the previous elements? Not sure. 4 (Row2's first element) +4 (Row2's second) +1 (Row2's third) =9, which isn't helpful.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each row's first zero block is the first three elements of the next row in the input. For example:\n\nRow0's first block should be Row1's first three elements:4,1,1. But in the output, it's 4,4,1. So maybe modified. Not matching. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the first zero block is the sum of the three elements before the 5. For Row0's first three elements:1+1+2=4. So 4, then maybe the next two numbers? Not sure. The first block is 4,4,1. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's a rotation of the elements before 5. For Row0's input elements [1,1,2], a rotation could give [1,2,1], but the output is 4,4,1. Doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, let's look at Example 1's inputs and outputs.\n\nExample1:\n\nInput rows:\n\nRow0: [6,3,3,5,0,0,0,5,0,0,0]\nRow1: [6,3,3,5,0,0,0,5,0,0,0]\nRow2: [6,3,2,5,0,0,0,5,0,0,0]\n\nOutputs:\n\nRow0: [6,3,3,5,6,6,6,5,2,3,6]\nRow1: [6,3,3,5,3,3,3,5,3,3,6]\nRow2: [6,3,2,5,2,3,3,5,3,3,6]\n\nFirst zero blocks:\n\nRow0's first block:6,6,6 \u2192 which matches the first element of the input row (6), repeated thrice.\n\nRow1's first block:3,3,3 \u2192 which is the second element of the input row (3) repeated.\n\nRow2's first block:2,3,3 \u2192 the third element (2) followed by two 3s? Not sure.\n\nWait, the input rows in Example1 have first three elements as follows:\n\nRow0:6,3,3 \u2192 first block output is 6,6,6.\n\nRow1:6,3,3 \u2192 first block output is3,3,3.\n\nRow2:6,3,2 \u2192 first block output is2,3,3.\n\nHmm. For Row0, the first block is all 6s. For Row1, all 3s. For Row2, starts with 2 then 3s.\n\nWait, maybe the first zero block is filled with the sum of the first three elements modulo something. Row0's sum is6+3+3=12. But 6,6,6 sum to 18. Not sure. Or maybe the sum is 12 \u2192 12 mod 10 is 2, but not matching.\n\nAlternatively, the first zero block is filled with the maximum of the first three elements. For Row0: max(6,3,3)=6 \u2192 filled with 6,6,6. For Row1: same first three elements, but the output is 3,3,3. So that's not matching. Unless the rows are processed differently.\n\nWait in Example1's output:\n\nRow0's first block is6,6,6. Row1's is3,3,3. Row2's is2,3,3. Let's see:\n\nRow0's input first three:6,3,3. Output first block:6,6,6. Maybe take the first element and repeat thrice.\n\nRow1's input first three:6,3,3. Output first block:3,3,3. Take the second element and repeat thrice.\n\nRow2's input first three:6,3,2. Output first block:2,3,3. Take the third element and then the second? Or perhaps the third element and then the second twice. \n\nHmm, not sure. But there's a pattern here where each row's first zero block is filled with a certain element repeated thrice, but varying which element. For Row0, first element; Row1, second; Row2, third. Then for the next zero block (after second 5), the reverse of the first block.\n\nIn Example1's Row0's second zero block is 2,3,6. Which is the reverse of 6,6,6 \u2192 no. But wait, the first block is6,6,6. Reverse would be6,6,6. But the second block is2,3,6. Not reverse. Maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the second block is filled with different logic. For Example0's first row, second block is1,4,4. Which is reverse of4,4,1. For Example1's first row, second block is2,3,6. Reverse of6,6,6 would be6,6,6. Doesn't match.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the second block is filled with the elements from the next rows. For Example0's first row's second block is1,4,4. Which could be Row1's first three elements (4,1,1) but reversed. 4,1,1 reversed is1,1,4. But the output is1,4,4. Not matching. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the second block is filled with the elements from the previous row's first block. Example0's Row0's second block is1,4,4. Row0's first block is4,4,1. So reversed. Yes. So first block is4,4,1 \u2192 reversed gives1,4,4. So the second block is the reverse of the first block.\n\nLet's check other examples. In Example1's Row0, first block is6,6,6 \u2192 reversed would be6,6,6. But the second block is2,3,6. Doesn't match. So maybe this isn't the case.\n\nHmm. Maybe the pattern is different. Let's look at Example2:\n\nExample2's input rows are:\n\nRow0: [2,7,8,5,0,0,0,5,0,0,0]\nRow1: [7,7,8,5,0,0,0,5,0,0,0]\nRow2: [8,8,8,5,0,0,0,5,0,0,0]\n\nOutputs:\n\nRow0: [2,7,8,5,8,7,2,5,8,8,8]\nRow1: [7,7,8,5,8,7,7,5,8,7,7]\nRow2: [8,8,8,5,8,8,8,5,8,7,2]\n\nFirst zero blocks:\n\nRow0's first block:8,7,2 \u2192 which is the reverse of the first three elements (2,7,8). Yes! 2,7,8 reversed is8,7,2. And the second block (after second 5) is8,8,8. Which is the reverse of the first block (8,7,2 \u2192 reversed is2,7,8. No, but the second block is8,8,8. Hmm, not reversed. Wait, the second block in Row0 is8,8,8. Which is the reverse of8,7,2 \u2192 2,7,8. Not matching. So that theory is wrong.\n\nWait, Row0's first block is8,7,2. Reverse is2,7,8. But the second block is8,8,8. Not sure. \n\nLooking at Row1's first block:8,7,7. The input first three elements are7,7,8. Reverse is8,7,7. Which matches. So first block is reversed input first three elements. Then the second block is8,7,7 reversed \u21927,7,8. But the output's second block is8,7,7. Hmm, no. So that doesn't fit.\n\nRow2's first block is8,8,8. Input first three elements are8,8,8 \u2192 reversed is same. So first block is same. Then the second block is8,7,2. Which is the reverse of8,8,8? No. 8,8,8 reversed is same, but output is8,7,2. Hmm.\n\nSo maybe the first zero block is the reverse of the first three elements. Let's check Example0's first row. Input first three:1,1,2. Reverse is2,1,1. But output's first block is4,4,1. Doesn't match. So that theory doesn't hold for Example0.\n\nSo the pattern isn't consistent across examples. Hmm.\n\nAlternative approach: Let's look at the first zero block of each output row and see if it relates to the other rows' input.\n\nIn Example0's first output row, first zero block is4,4,1. The inputs for the three rows start with [1,1,2], [4,1,1], [4,4,1]. So maybe the first zero block of Row0's output is the first three elements of Row1 and Row2. For example, 4 (Row1's first element), 4 (Row2's first), 1 (Row1's third). That would give 4,4,1. Then the second block is reverse:1,4,4.\n\nFor Row1's output in Example0, first zero block is4,1,1. Which are the first three elements of Row1's input. Then the second block is1,1,4 (reverse of4,1,1).\n\nRow2's output first zero block is1,1,2. Which could be the first three elements of Row0's input (1,1,2). Then reversed for the second block.\n\nSo the pattern might be:\n\nFor each row i in the input, the first zero block is filled with the first three elements of row (i+1) mod 3. Then the second zero block is the reverse of that.\n\nTesting this:\n\nIn Example0:\n\nRow0 (i=0) \u2192 first zero block should be Row1's first three elements [4,1,1]. But output is [4,4,1]. Not matching. So maybe not.\n\nAlternative, the first zero block is filled with the first three elements of the next row, but each element is transformed. For example, in Row0's case, next row's first three are4,1,1. Maybe take first element (4), next element from next row's first element (4 again, from Row2?), third element from next row's third element (1). So 4,4,1. Which matches Row0's first zero block. Then the second block is reverse:1,4,4.\n\nSimilarly, for Row1's first zero block: next row is Row2, which has first three elements [4,4,1]. So first three elements of next row:4,4,1. But Row1's output first zero block is4,1,1. Hmm, not matching. So this theory doesn't hold.\n\nAlternative approach: Let's look for patterns in the numbers. For Example0's first output row, the first zero block is4,4,1. The second block is1,4,4. These are the same numbers but reversed. Similarly, the other rows have reversed second blocks. So perhaps the first zero block is filled with some values, and the second is their reverse.\n\nNow, how to determine the first zero block's values.\n\nLooking at Example1's first row:\n\nInput first three:6,3,3. Output first zero block:6,6,6. Then second block is2,3,6 (reverse of6,6,6 is6,6,6, but output is2,3,6). Not matching.\n\nWait, but in Example1's third row, input first three:6,3,2. Output first zero block:2,3,3. Then second block:3,3,6. So first block is2,3,3; reversed is3,3,2. Not matching the second block (3,3,6). Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the first block is filled with the next row's first three elements. For Example0, Row0's first zero block is Row1's first three elements [4,1,1], but output is4,4,1. Not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each row's first zero block is filled with the elements from the same position in the other rows. For example, in Example0's three input rows, the first elements are 1,4,4. So maybe the first zero block's elements are 4,4,1 (the first elements of the other rows). Then the second block is reverse. That could work for Row0's first block:4 (from Row1's first element),4 (Row2's first element),1 (Row0's third element). Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the first zero block is filled with the sum of the first elements of all three rows. For Example0, sum of first elements is1+4+4=9. But the first zero block is4,4,1. Not sure.\n\nLet me think differently. The input is three rows, each with two blocks of zeros. The output replaces each zero block with certain numbers. The output's three rows seem to be interconnected. Maybe each output row is derived from the inputs of all three rows.\n\nFor example, the first zero block in Row0's output is filled with elements from Row1 and Row2. For Example0, Row0's first zero block is4,4,1. Row1's first three elements are4,1,1. Row2's first three are4,4,1. So maybe the first element is Row1's first, second element is Row2's first, third element is Row1's third. So 4,4,1. That matches.\n\nThen, the second zero block is the reverse of the first. So first zero block4,4,1 \u2192 reverse1,4,4. Which matches Row0's second block.\n\nTesting this for Example0's Row1:\n\nFirst zero block in output is4,1,1. Which would be Row2's first three elements (4,4,1), but maybe first element from Row2's first (4), second from Row0's first (1), third from Row1's third (1). Hmm, not matching. Because Row0's first element is1, but how to get 4,1,1.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each row's first zero block is the same as the next row's first three elements. For Example0:\n\nRow0's first zero block: Row1's first three \u21924,1,1. But output is4,4,1. Doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each row's first zero block is filled with the first three elements of the next row, but each element is increased by some value. For example, Row0's next row is Row1, which has first three elements4,1,1. If we add 0 to each, it would be4,1,1. But output is4,4,1. So second element is increased by3. That's arbitrary.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Let's try to find another angle.\n\nLooking at Example2:\n\nRow0's input first three elements:2,7,8. Output first zero block:8,7,2. Which is the reverse of input. Then the second zero block is8,8,8. Not reversed, but perhaps the first block's reverse is2,7,8, but output is8,8,8. Not sure.\n\nRow1's input first three:7,7,8. Output first block:8,7,7. Which is the reverse of input. Then second block is8,7,7 \u2192 reversed is7,7,8. Which is not matching the output's second block (8,7,7). Hmm.\n\nRow2's input first three:8,8,8. Output first block:8,8,8. Reverse is same. Second block is8,7,2. Which is the reverse of the first three elements of Row0's input (2,7,8). So perhaps the second block is filled with the reverse of another row's first three elements.\n\nThis seems inconsistent, but maybe there's a pattern where each row's first zero block is the reverse of its own first three elements, and the second block is the reverse of the next row's first three elements.\n\nExample0's Row0:\n\nInput first three:1,1,2 \u2192 reverse is2,1,1. Output first block is4,4,1. Doesn't match.\n\nExample2's Row0:\n\nInput first three:2,7,8 \u2192 reverse is8,7,2. Which matches the first block.\n\nRow1: input first three:7,7,8 \u2192 reverse8,7,7. Matches first block.\n\nRow2: input first three:8,8,8 \u2192 reverse same. Matches first block.\n\nSo for Example2, the first block is reverse of own first three. The second block for Row0 is8,8,8. Which could be the reverse of Row2's first three elements (8,8,8), reversed is same. But the output's second block is8,8,8. So maybe for Example2, the second block is the reverse of the third row's first three elements.\n\nBut how does this apply to other examples?\n\nIn Example1's Row0:\n\nInput first three:6,3,3 \u2192 reverse is3,3,6. But output's first block is6,6,6. Doesn't match. So this pattern only holds for Example2.\n\nHmm, maybe the pattern varies between examples. But that's unlikely; the pattern should be consistent.\n\nAlternative theory: For each row in the input, the first block of zeros is filled with the elements from the same position in the other rows. For example:\n\nIn Example0's Row0's first zero block (positions4-6), which are indices4,5,6. These positions in other rows:\n\nRow1's indices4-6 are zeros, but input is zeros. Maybe in output, the values are taken from other rows. But output for Row0's first block is4,4,1. Looking at other rows' outputs:\n\nRow1's output first three elements are4,1,1, so indices0-2 are4,1,1. Row2's first three are4,4,1.\n\nSo, perhaps for Row0's first block, the elements are taken from Row1 and Row2's first elements. For example:\n\nRow0's first zero block is4,4,1. These correspond to:\n\n- Row1's first element (4)\n- Row2's first element (4)\n- Row1's third element (1)\n\nBut this is speculative.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the first zero block is filled with the first three elements of the next row's input, but in a certain order. For Example0, Row0's next row is Row1, which has first three elements4,1,1. So 4,1,1. But Row0's first zero block is4,4,1. Maybe the first element is taken from Row1, second from Row2, third from Row1.\n\nThis seems complicated, but let's test for Example0:\n\nRow0's first zero block:4 (Row1's first),4 (Row2's first),1 (Row1's third) \u2192 4,4,1. Which matches.\n\nRow1's first zero block:4 (Row2's first),1 (Row0's first),1 (Row2's third) \u21924,1,1. Which matches.\n\nRow2's first zero block:1 (Row0's first),1 (Row0's first),2 (Row0's third) \u21921,1,2. Which matches.\n\nOh, this seems promising! So the first zero block for each row is constructed by taking:\n\n- The first element from the next row's input\n- The first element from the row after next's input\n- The third element from the next row's input.\n\nBut let's clarify the rows:\n\nIn Example0:\n\nRows are 0,1,2.\n\nRow0's next row is 1, row after next is 2 (since it's circular? No, since there are three rows. For Row2, next row would be Row0? Or maybe not.)\n\nAlternatively, the first zero block for each row i is:\n\n- Element0: next row's first element\n- Element1: next next row's first element\n- Element2: next row's third element\n\nLet's see:\n\nRow0's first zero block elements:\n\nnext row (Row1) first element:4\n\nnext next row (Row2) first element:4\n\nnext row (Row1) third element:1\n\nSo elements are4,4,1 \u2192 matches.\n\nRow1's first zero block elements:\n\nnext row (Row2) first element:4\n\nnext next row (Row0) first element:1\n\nnext row (Row2) third element:1\n\nSo elements are4,1,1 \u2192 matches.\n\nRow2's first zero block elements:\n\nnext row (Row0) first element:1\n\nnext next row (Row1) first element:4\n\nnext row (Row0) third element:2\n\nSo elements are1,4,2. But output is1,1,2. Doesn't match. Hmm, so this theory fails for Row2.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for Row2, the next row is Row0, but next next row is Row1. So:\n\nRow2's first zero block:\n\nElement0: Row0's first element (1)\n\nElement1: Row1's first element (4)\n\nElement2: Row0's third element (2)\n\nWhich would be1,4,2. But output is1,1,2. So no.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the elements are taken from the next row's first three elements, but in a different order. For example:\n\nRow0's first zero block is Row1's first three elements [4,1,1], but reordered as first, first, third \u21924,4,1. \n\nRow1's first zero block is Row2's first three elements [4,4,1], reordered as first, third, third \u21924,1,1.\n\nRow2's first zero block is Row0's first three elements [1,1,2], reordered as first, first, third \u21921,1,2.\n\nYes! That matches.\n\nSo for each row i, the first zero block is made from the next row's (i+1 mod 3) first three elements, taking the first element, then the first element again, then the third element.\n\nLet's check:\n\nExample0:\n\nRow0's next row is Row1, first three elements4,1,1. Take first (4), first (4), third (1) \u21924,4,1. Correct.\n\nRow1's next row is Row2, first three4,4,1. Take first (4), first (4), third (1) \u21924,4,1. But Row1's first zero block is4,1,1. Wait, that's not matching.\n\nHmm, maybe not. Alternatively, maybe the pattern is take the next row's first element, then the same row's third element, then the next row's third element.\n\nNot sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the first zero block for each row is created by taking the next row's first element, then the same next row's first element again, then the next row's third element. For Example0's Row0: next row's (Row1) first element is4, third element is1. So 4,4,1. Which matches. For Row1's next row is Row2, first element4, third element1. So4,4,1. But Row1's output first zero block is4,1,1. So this doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. Let's think again.\n\nIn Example0, the output for each row's first zero block is:\n\nRow0:4,4,1\n\nRow1:4,1,1\n\nRow2:1,1,2\n\nLooking at the next row's first three elements:\n\nRow0's next row is Row1:4,1,1. So for Row0's first zero block, the first two elements are4,4. How do we get that? Maybe the first element is Row1's first, second element is Row2's first (4), third is Row1's third (1). So 4,4,1.\n\nRow1's next row is Row2:4,4,1. So first zero block would be Row2's first (4), next row's first (which is Row0's first,1), third is Row2's third (1). So4,1,1.\n\nRow2's next row is Row0:1,1,2. So first zero block is Row0's first (1), next row's first (Row1's first,4), third is Row0's third (2). So1,4,2. But the output is1,1,2. Doesn't match. \n\nWait, but the output for Row2's first zero block is1,1,2. So maybe the next row's first three elements are Row0's (1,1,2). Take first, first, third \u21921,1,2. Which matches.\n\nAh! So the pattern is:\n\nFor each row i, the first zero block is constructed by taking the next row's (i+1 mod3) first three elements, and using first element, first element again, third element.\n\nYes! For Example0:\n\nRow0's next row is Row1 (i=1). First three elements are4,1,1. Take first (4), first (4), third (1) \u21924,4,1.\n\nRow1's next row is Row2 (i=2). First three elements are4,4,1. Take first (4), first (4), third (1) \u21924,4,1. But wait, Row1's output first zero block is4,1,1. Hmm, this contradicts. So this theory is incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the pattern is different. Let's think again.\n\nLooking at Example0's outputs:\n\nRow0's first zero block:4,4,1 \u2192 which is Row1's first element (4), Row2's first element (4), Row1's third element (1). \n\nRow1's first zero block:4,1,1 \u2192 Row2's first element (4), Row0's first element (1), Row2's third element (1). \n\nRow2's first zero block:1,1,2 \u2192 Row0's first element (1), Row1's first element (4?), no. Output is1,1,2. Row0's first three elements are1,1,2. So maybe first element (1), first again (1), third (2). \n\nYes! That fits. So for each row i, the first zero block is constructed from the next row's (i+1 mod3) first three elements as follows: take first element, first element again, third element.\n\nFor Example0's Row0, next row is Row1:4,1,1 \u2192 4,4,1.\n\nRow1's next row is Row2:4,4,1 \u2192 4,4,1. But the output is4,1,1. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for each row i, the first zero block is constructed from the next row's first three elements, but the first element is taken from the next row's first element, the second from the same row's first element, and the third from the next row's third element.\n\nFor Row0 (Example0):\n\nNext row's (Row1) first three:4,1,1 \u2192 first element4, same row's first element (Row0's is1), and next row's third element1. So 4,1,1. But output is4,4,1. So that doesn't fit.\n\nThis is getting too convoluted. Maybe another approach.\n\nLooking at Example0's first zero blocks:\n\nRow0:4,4,1 \u2192 sum is 9.\n\nRow1:4,1,1 \u2192 sum 6.\n\nRow2:1,1,2 \u2192 sum 4.\n\nNot seeing a pattern.\n\nAnother observation: The first zero block for each row in Example0 is made up of elements that appear in the other rows. For example, 4 from Row1 and Row2, 1 from Row1 and Row0. But not sure.\n\nLet me consider the test input:\n\nTest Input:\n\n[3,3,9,5,0,0,0,5,0,0,0]\n\n[9,9,9,5,0,0,0,5,0,0,0]\n\n[2,9,9,5,0,0,0,5,0,0,0]\n\nWe need to generate three output rows. According to the pattern, each row's first zero block is filled with some values derived from other rows, and the second zero block is the reverse.\n\nBut how?\n\nAssuming that the pattern observed in Example2 applies here, where the first zero block is the reverse of the first three elements, then the second zero block is the reverse of that.\n\nFor Example2's Row0:\n\nInput first three:2,7,8 \u2192 reverse is8,7,2 \u2192 first zero block. Second zero block is8,8,8. Hmm, not reverse.\n\nBut in Example2's Row0, the second zero block is8,8,8, which is the reverse of the first zero block (8,7,2) reversed again. No.\n\nAlternatively, the second zero block is filled with the reverse of the first three elements of another row.\n\nIn Example2's Row0's second zero block is8,8,8, which is the first three elements of Row2's input reversed (8,8,8 reversed is same).\n\nFor the test input, perhaps:\n\nRow0's first three elements are3,3,9 \u2192 reverse is9,3,3. So first zero block is9,3,3. Second zero block is reverse of that \u21923,3,9.\n\nRow1's first three:9,9,9 \u2192 reverse is9,9,9. So first block is9,9,9. Second block is reverse:9,9,9.\n\nRow2's first three:2,9,9 \u2192 reverse is9,9,2. First block is9,9,2. Second block is2,9,9.\n\nBut let's check if this aligns with the training examples.\n\nIn Example0, this pattern doesn't hold. So maybe this is only for Example2. But the test input might follow Example2's pattern.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the pattern is that the first zero block is the reverse of the first three elements of the same row, and the second zero block is the reverse of the first zero block. So for each row, first block reversed becomes the second block.\n\nFor Example0's Row0, first block is4,4,1 \u2192 reversed is1,4,4. Which matches the second block. But first block is not reverse of input's first three elements (1,1,2 \u2192 reversed 2,1,1).\n\nBut in Example2's Row0, first block is reverse of input's first three elements, and second block is reverse of first block (8,7,2 reversed is2,7,8. But output's second block is8,8,8. So that doesn't match.\n\nSo this theory isn't consistent.\n\nAlternative approach: Let's consider the possibility that the first zero block in each output row is the first three elements of the next row in the input. For the test input:\n\nTest Input Rows:\n\nRow0: [3,3,9,5,0,0,0,5,0,0,0]\n\nRow1: [9,9,9,5,0,0,0,5,0,0,0]\n\nRow2: [2,9,9,5,0,0,0,5,0,0,0]\n\nAssuming that for each row i, the first zero block is filled with the first three elements of row (i+1) mod3.\n\nRow0's first zero block: Row1's first three:9,9,9 \u2192 output first zero block would be9,9,9. Then second zero block is reversed:9,9,9.\n\nRow1's first zero block: Row2's first three:2,9,9 \u2192 output first zero block:2,9,9. Second block reversed:9,9,2.\n\nRow2's first zero block: Row0's first three:3,3,9 \u2192 output first zero block:3,3,9. Second block reversed:9,3,3.\n\nBut comparing with Example2's output:\n\nExample2's Row0's first zero block is the reverse of its own first three elements. Which would be8,7,2 for input2,7,8. But according to this theory, it would be the next row's first three elements (7,7,8). But Example2's first zero block is8,7,2. So this theory doesn't hold.\n\nBut in the test input, maybe the pattern is that each row's first zero block is filled with the next row's first three elements. Let's try that.\n\nFor the test input:\n\nRow0's first zero block: Row1's first three elements:9,9,9 \u2192 so [9,9,9,5, ...]. Second zero block is reverse:9,9,9 reversed is9,9,9.\n\nRow1's first zero block: Row2's first three elements:2,9,9 \u2192 so [2,9,9,5, ...]. Second zero block reversed is9,9,2.\n\nRow2's first zero block: Row0's first three elements:3,3,9 \u2192 so [3,3,9,5, ...]. Second zero block reversed is9,3,3.\n\nBut let's check if this aligns with any of the training examples.\n\nIn Example0, Row0's first zero block would be Row1's first three elements:4,1,1. But the output is4,4,1. So this doesn't fit.\n\nThus, this theory is incorrect.\n\nAnother angle: Let's look at the sum of the first three elements and see if it's related to the first zero block.\n\nExample0's Row0: sum 1+1+2=4. First zero block elements are4,4,1. Sum of zero block is9.\n\nExample1's Row0: sum6+3+3=12. Zero block6,6,6 sum18. No relation.\n\nExample2's Row0: sum2+7+8=17. Zero block8,7,2 sum17. Which matches. So here, sum of zero block equals sum of first three elements.\n\nRow1's sum7+7+8=22. Zero block8,7,7 sum22. Yes.\n\nRow2's sum8+8+8=24. Zero block8,8,8 sum24. Yes.\n\nSo in Example2, the first zero block elements sum to the same as the sum of the first three elements. And the elements are the reverse of the first three elements.\n\nAh! So for Example2, the first zero block is the reverse of the first three elements, and their sum is the same. The second zero block sum is sum of the first zero block reversed (same sum), but the elements are different. Wait, no. Second zero block in Row0 is8,8,8 sum24. Original sum was17. So this theory only applies to Example2.\n\nBut perhaps in the test input, this pattern applies. Let's check:\n\nTest input Row0: sum3+3+9=15. If first zero block is reverse (9,3,3) sum15. Second zero block could be sum15 as well. For example, 9,3,3 reversed is3,3,9. Sum15. But the second zero block in Example2's Row0 is8,8,8 sum24, which is different. So this theory isn't consistent.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and the lack of a clear pattern, I'll have to make an educated guess based on the examples.\n\nLooking at the test input:\n\nTest rows:\n\nRow0: [3,3,9,5,0,0,0,5,0,0,0]\n\nRow1: [9,9,9,5,0,0,0,5,0,0,0]\n\nRow2: [2,9,9,5,0,0,0,5,0,0,0]\n\nAssuming the pattern from Example2 applies here, where the first zero block is the reverse of the first three elements and the second zero block is the reverse of the next row's first three elements.\n\nFor Row0:\n\nFirst three elements3,3,9 \u2192 reverse9,3,3. First zero block:9,3,3.\n\nSecond zero block after second5. If following Example2's pattern, the second zero block is the reverse of Row2's first three elements (2,9,9 \u2192 reverse9,9,2).\n\nSo Row0's output would be [3,3,9,5,9,3,3,5,9,9,2].\n\nRow1's first three elements9,9,9 \u2192 reverse9,9,9. Second zero block reverse of Row0's first three elements3,3,9 \u21929,3,3. So output: [9,9,9,5,9,9,9,5,9,3,3].\n\nRow2's first three elements2,9,9 \u2192 reverse9,9,2. Second zero block reverse of Row1's first three elements9,9,9 \u21929,9,9. So output: [2,9,9,5,9,9,2,5,9,9,9].\n\nBut let's check if this aligns with Example0 and Example1.\n\nIn Example1, Row0's first three elements are6,3,3. Reverse is3,3,6. But output first zero block is6,6,6. So this doesn't fit. So this pattern only applies to Example2 and perhaps the test input.\n\nAlternatively, the first zero block is filled with the same element thrice, which is the first element of the next row. For example:\n\nTest input Row0's next row is Row1, first element9. So first zero block9,9,9. Second zero block reverse9,9,9 \u21929,9,9.\n\nRow1's next row is Row2, first element2 \u2192 first zero block2,2,2. Reverse is2,2,2.\n\nRow2's next row is Row0, first element3 \u2192 first zero block3,3,3. Reverse3,3,3.\n\nBut looking at Example0's first zero block is4,4,1. Which would require next row's first element to be4 (Row1's first element), but third element1. So this theory doesn't fit.\n\nAnother possible pattern: Each zero block is filled with the digits of the row's first three elements in a different order. For Example0's Row0: 1,1,2 \u2192 first zero block4,4,1. Not clear.\n\nGiven the time constraints, I'll proceed with the assumption that each row's first zero block is the reverse of its own first three elements, and the second zero block is the reverse of the next row's first three elements. Applying this to the test input:\n\nTest input:\n\nRow0: first three3,3,9 \u2192 reverse9,3,3. Second zero block reverse of Row1's first three (9,9,9 \u21929,9,9).\n\nRow0's output: [3,3,9,5,9,3,3,5,9,9,9].\n\nRow1's first three9,9,9 \u2192 reverse9,9,9. Second zero block reverse of Row2's first three2,9,9 \u21929,9,2. So output: [9,9,9,5,9,9,9,5,9,9,2].\n\nRow2's first three2,9,9 \u2192 reverse9,9,2. Second zero block reverse of Row0's first three3,3,9 \u21929,3,3. So output: [2,9,9,5,9,9,2,5,9,3,3].\n\nBut looking at the training examples, particularly Example2's output, this pattern seems to align. For example, in Example2's Row0, second zero block is8,8,8, which is reverse of Row2's first three (8,8,8 \u2192 reverse same). So this matches.\n\nApplying this pattern to the test input gives the following outputs:\n\nRow0: [3,3,9,5,9,3,3,5,9,9,9]\n\nRow1: [9,9,9,5,9,9,9,5,9,9,2]\n\nRow2: [2,9,9,5,9,9,2,5,9,3,3]\n\nBut checking the training examples:\n\nIn Example2's Row0, the second zero block is8,8,8. Which is the reverse of Row2's first three (8,8,8 \u2192 reverse same). So this fits.\n\nRow1's output in Example2 has second zero block8,7,7. Which is the reverse of Row2's first three (8,8,8 \u2192 reverse is8,8,8). Doesn't match. So the pattern might not hold for all rows.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and the need to provide an answer, I'll proceed with this pattern and see if the outputs align with the training examples."
