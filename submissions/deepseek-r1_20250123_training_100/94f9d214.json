        "cot_1": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. So, we have these input grids and corresponding output grids. The task is to determine how the input is transformed into the output. Let's start by looking at the training examples to see if I can spot any patterns.\n\nFirst, looking at the structure. Each input has 8 rows, and the output has 4 rows. So maybe the input is two separate 4-row grids stacked, and the output is derived from combining them? Let's check.\n\nWait, in Example 0, the input is 8 rows, each of 4 elements. The output is 4 rows. Similarly, other examples follow. So perhaps the input is divided into two parts: the first four rows and the next four rows, and the output is generated by some operation between these two parts.\n\nLooking at Example 0's input:\n\nFirst four rows (maybe part A):\n[0,0,0,0]\n[0,3,3,0]\n[0,0,0,0]\n[3,0,0,3]\n\nNext four rows (part B):\n[0,0,0,1]\n[1,0,1,1]\n[1,1,1,1]\n[0,1,0,1]\n\nOutput:\n[2,2,2,0]\n[0,0,0,0]\n[0,0,0,0]\n[0,0,2,0]\n\nHmm. Let's compare part A and part B. Maybe the output is generated based on interactions between elements of part A and part B in the same column or position. Let's check each element in the output.\n\nFor the first row of output: [2,2,2,0]. Let's look at the first column in part A and part B. \n\nPart A's first column: 0,0,0,3 (rows 0-3, column 0)\nPart B's first column: 0,1,1,0 (rows 4-7, column 0)\nWait, but how does that lead to 2 in the output? Maybe it's the count of certain numbers. Or perhaps when certain conditions are met in the same position across parts A and B.\n\nAlternatively, maybe part A and part B are two layers, and the output is a combination where 3s and 1s interact. Let me think: 3 and 1. Maybe when a 3 in part A and a 1 in part B in the same position, they produce a 2 in the output. Let's check.\n\nIn Example 0's part A, row 1 has 3s in positions 1 and 2. Part B's row 0 (which is the fifth input row) has 0,0,0,1. So in column 3 of part A and part B row 0: part A has 0, part B has 1. But the output's first row (output row 0) has 2s in the first three positions. Let's see if in the same positions in part A and part B (over the same rows?), but maybe different rows.\n\nWait, maybe the output is generated by comparing each position across the two parts (A and B) for each row. But since the output has 4 rows, perhaps each output row is derived from the corresponding two input rows (one from part A and one from part B). For example, output row 0 could be a combination of part A row 0 and part B row 0. Let's check.\n\nIn Example 0, part A row 0 is [0,0,0,0], part B row 0 is [0,0,0,1]. Output row 0 is [2,2,2,0]. How does that happen? Hmm, maybe 0s in part A and non-zero in part B? Or perhaps the sum of part A and part B elements. But 0+0=0, but output is 2. That doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's about the presence of 3s in part A and 1s in part B. Let's check:\n\nLooking at output row 0, columns 0-2 are 2s and column 3 is 0. In part A row 0, all are 0. In part B row 0, column 3 is 1. So how does that lead to 2s in the first three columns? Not sure.\n\nWait, maybe the output is created by looking at columns across the two parts. For instance, each column in the output is determined by the corresponding columns in part A and part B. Let's take column 0 of Example 0's output. The output's first column (0th column) across all output rows is [2,0,0,0]. Let's see the part A and part B for column 0.\n\nPart A column 0: 0 (row0), 0 (row1), 0 (row2), 3 (row3)\nPart B column 0: 0 (row4), 1 (row5), 1 (row6), 0 (row7)\n\nHmm, how does that lead to the output column? Maybe looking for positions where part A has a 3 and part B has a 1. For example, in part A row3 (row3 of part A) column0 is 3. In part B, row3 (row7 of input) column0 is 0. So that's 3 in part A and 0 in part B. No 1 here. But in part B row5 (input row5) column0 is 1, but part A row1 (input row1) column0 is 0. So maybe not that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output counts the number of 3s in part A and 1s in part B in the same column, but across all rows. Let's see. For column0 in part A: 3 appears once (row3). In part B column0: 1 appears twice (rows5 and6). So the count of 3s in part A is 1, and 1s in part B is 2. How does that relate to output? The output column0 has 2 in row0 and 0s in others. Not sure.\n\nMaybe the output is a grid where each cell is 2 if certain conditions are met. Let's look for when 2 appears. In Example 0's output, the first row has three 2s. Let's check their positions. For example, output cell (0,0) is 2. In part A row0 column0 is 0, part B row0 column0 is 0. So why 2 here?\n\nWait, maybe the output is derived from the sum of the top and bottom parts in some way. But part A and part B each have four rows. How to combine them into four output rows. Maybe each output row is a combination of two input rows. For example, output row 0 could be part A row0 and part B row0. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is created by overlaying part A and part B and applying some rules. For instance, where a 3 in part A and a 1 in part B in the same position would result in a 2. Let's check that.\n\nIn Example0's part A row1, columns1 and 2 are 3s. Part B row1 (input row5) columns0 is 1, columns2 and3 are 1s. There's no overlap here. But output row0 has 2s in columns0-2, but in part A row0, all are 0s. So this theory might not hold.\n\nAnother approach: look for transitions from input to output. For example, in Example0's output, the first row has 2s where part B's first row (row4) has 0s except column3. Wait, part B row4 (input row4) is [0,0,0,1]. Output row0 is [2,2,2,0]. So where part B row4 has 0s, output is 2? But in column3, part B row4 has 1, and output is 0. So maybe 0 in part B becomes 2, and 1 becomes 0? But that doesn't fit because in other examples, like part B rows in other examples might have different outputs.\n\nWait, let's check another example. Example1's input part B (last four rows):\n\n[0,0,0,1]\n[0,0,0,1]\n[0,1,0,0]\n[1,0,0,1]\n\nThe output for Example1 is:\n\n[0,0,0,0]\n[2,0,0,0]\n[2,0,0,0]\n[0,2,2,0]\n\nLooking at output row1 (which is [2,0,0,0]), perhaps corresponding to part B row5 (input row5 is [0,0,0,1]). If part B's row5 has 0s except column3, but output row1 has 2 in column0. So the previous idea isn't holding.\n\nAlternative approach: Maybe the output is a 4x4 grid where each cell (i,j) is determined by some operation between the two 4x4 grids in the input. Let's split each input into two 4x4 grids. For example, the first four rows are grid A, and the next four are grid B. Then, the output is derived from these two grids.\n\nLet me try with Example0:\n\nGrid A:\n[0,0,0,0]\n[0,3,3,0]\n[0,0,0,0]\n[3,0,0,3]\n\nGrid B:\n[0,0,0,1]\n[1,0,1,1]\n[1,1,1,1]\n[0,1,0,1]\n\nOutput:\n[2,2,2,0]\n[0,0,0,0]\n[0,0,0,0]\n[0,0,2,0]\n\nNow, maybe each cell in the output is determined by the corresponding cells in grid A and grid B. Let's see cell (0,0) in output is 2. Grid A (0,0) is 0, grid B (0,0) is 0. How does 0 and 0 lead to 2?\n\nHmm. Maybe it's the sum of the counts of certain values in the same column across grids A and B. For example, in column0 of grid A, how many 3s are there? In grid A, column0 has 0,0,0,3. So one 3. In grid B column0, values are 0,1,1,0. Two 1s. So maybe 1 (3s) + 2 (1s) = 3? But output cell (0,0) is 2. Doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe for each column in grids A and B, we count the number of 3s in grid A and 1s in grid B. Then, the sum (or some function) is placed in the output. But how?\n\nIn Example0, let's take column0. Grid A has 3 in row3 (so one 3). Grid B has 1s in rows5 and6 (two 1s). So 1+2=3, but output column0 has 2 in row0 and 0s in others. Not matching.\n\nAlternatively, the output might represent the difference between the number of 3s in grid A and 1s in grid B for each column. But 1-2= -1, which doesn't fit.\n\nAnother idea: Maybe each output cell is 2 if there's a 3 in grid A and a 1 in grid B in the same position. Let's check. In Example0's grid A cell (1,1) is 3. Grid B cell (1,1) is 0. So no. Output cell (0,0) is 2, but both grids have 0 here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output cell is 2 if in the same column, grid A has a 3 and grid B has a 1 in any row. For example, in column0 of grid A, there's a 3 in row3. In grid B column0, there are 1s in rows5 and6. So maybe that's why output row0 column0 is 2. But how does the row in the output relate to this?\n\nAlternatively, the output is a 4x4 grid where each cell (i,j) is determined by the presence of 3s in grid A and 1s in grid B in the same column, but perhaps considering their positions. Maybe for each column j, if there's a 3 in grid A's row i and a 1 in grid B's row i in the same column j, then output's row i, column j is 2. Otherwise, 0. Let's test this.\n\nIn Example0, grid A row0: all 0s. Grid B row0: [0,0,0,1]. So no 3s in A, so output row0 would be 0s. But the output row0 is [2,2,2,0]. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAnother angle: Perhaps the output is a result of some bitwise operation between the two grids. For example, 3 is binary 11, 1 is 01. Maybe XOR? But 3 XOR 1 is 2 (binary 10). Wait, 3 is 11 in binary, 1 is 01. XOR is 10, which is 2. So maybe when a cell in grid A is 3 and the same cell in grid B is 1, the output is 2. Otherwise, 0. Let's check.\n\nIn Example0's grid A and grid B:\n\nFor cell (1,1) in grid A: 3. Grid B cell (1,1) is 0. So output would be 0. Which matches the output's row1, column1 being 0.\n\nWait, but the output in Example0's row0 is [2,2,2,0]. Let's check the corresponding cells in grid A and B. Grid A row0: all 0s. Grid B row0: [0,0,0,1]. So there's no cell where grid A is 3 and grid B is 1. So this theory doesn't explain that.\n\nBut wait, maybe it's not cell-wise. Maybe it's column-wise. For each column, if there's a 3 in grid A and a 1 in grid B in the same column (any row), then set that column in the output to 2. But how?\n\nIn Example0's output, first three columns of row0 are 2. Let's check columns 0,1,2. For column0 in grid A: there's a 3 in row3. Grid B column0 has 1s in rows5 and6. So maybe that's why column0 in output has 2. But why in row0?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output rows correspond to the rows in grid B. Like, if in a certain row of grid B there's a 1, then check if in the same row of grid A there's a 3. But in Example0's grid B row0 (input row4) is [0,0,0,1]. So column3 has 1. But grid A row0 (input row0) is all 0s. So no 3 here. So why output row0's first three columns are 2?\n\nHmm. Maybe this approach isn't working. Let's think differently.\n\nLooking at the outputs, they contain 0s and 2s. So perhaps the output is indicating some kind of overlap or collision between elements in the two grids. Let's think of grid A as having 3s and grid B as having 1s. Maybe when a 3 in grid A and a 1 in grid B are in the same column but different rows, the output's row corresponds to the position where they \"meet\".\n\nAlternatively, think of the grids as layers. For each column, if there's a 3 in grid A and a 1 in grid B in that column, but not in the same row, then in the output, the topmost row where this occurs gets a 2. But I need to check.\n\nIn Example0's column0:\n\nGrid A has 3 in row3 (index3). Grid B has 1s in rows5 and6 (which are part of grid B's rows1 and2, since grid B is rows4-7 of the input). So row3 in grid A and rows1 and2 in grid B. How does that translate to output row0 having a 2? Maybe the output rows are the intersection of grid A and grid B rows. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is the sum of the number of 3s in grid A and 1s in grid B for each column. For example, column0 in grid A has one 3 (row3), grid B has two 1s (rows5 and6). So total is 3, but output has 2s. Not matching.\n\nWait, in Example0's output, row0 has three 2s. Let me check if that's the number of 1s in grid B's first row (row4 of input). But row4 of grid B (input row4) is [0,0,0,1]. So three 0s and one 1. But output row0 has three 2s. Maybe each 0 in grid B's row4 becomes a 2, and the 1 becomes 0. But why? That seems arbitrary.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is based on the sum of 3s in grid A and 1s in grid B, but only in even positions. Not sure.\n\nLet's look at Example1's input:\n\nGrid A:\n[3,3,3,3]\n[0,3,3,0]\n[0,0,3,3]\n[3,0,0,0]\n\nGrid B:\n[0,0,0,1]\n[0,0,0,1]\n[0,1,0,0]\n[1,0,0,1]\n\nOutput:\n[0,0,0,0]\n[2,0,0,0]\n[2,0,0,0]\n[0,2,2,0]\n\nIn output row1 and row2 (indices1 and2), column0 has 2. Let's check grid B's rows1 and2 (input rows5 and6). Input row5 is [0,0,0,1], row6 is [0,1,0,0]. So in column0, grid B has 0 and 0. Why does output row1 and row2 have 2 in column0?\n\nLooking at grid A for column0. Grid A column0: 3 (row0), 0 (row1), 0 (row2),3 (row3). So two 3s. Grid B column0: 0 (row4),0 (row5),0 (row6),1 (row7). So one 1. So 3 in grid A and 1 in grid B. But output column0 has 2s in rows1 and2. Not sure.\n\nAlternative approach: Maybe the output rows are the result of some vertical or horizontal comparison between the two grids. For example, each output row is generated by comparing the corresponding row in grid A and grid B. But how?\n\nWait, the output has four rows. Grid A and grid B each have four rows. Maybe each output row is generated by combining grid A's row and grid B's row in some way.\n\nIn Example0, output row0 is [2,2,2,0]. Grid A row0 is [0,0,0,0], grid B row0 is [0,0,0,1]. So combining these two rows. How? Perhaps if grid A's row has a 3 and grid B's row has a 1 in the same position, then output 2. But in this case, grid A row0 has 0s and grid B row0 has a 1 in column3. So output column3 would be 0. But the output row0 has 0 in column3, which matches. But the first three columns are 2. But grid A row0 has 0s and grid B row0 has 0s in those columns. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output row is generated by checking where grid B's row has a certain pattern. For example, if a row in grid B has more 1s, then the corresponding output row has 2s. But in Example0's grid B row0 has only one 1. But output row0 has three 2s.\n\nHmm. This is getting complicated. Let's try a different angle. Let's look at all the output grids and see if there's a common pattern in their 2s.\n\nIn Example0's output, 2s are in the first three positions of row0 and in row3 column2.\n\nIn Example1's output, 2s are in row1 and row2 column0, and row3 columns1 and2.\n\nIn Example2's output, 2s are in row1 column2 and row2 column3.\n\nIn Example3's output, only row2 column1 has a 2.\n\nLooking for a pattern here. Maybe the 2s mark positions where, in the same column, there's a 3 in grid A above a 1 in grid B. But how?\n\nFor Example0's output row0 column0: 2. Let's check column0 of grid A and grid B. Grid A has a 3 in row3 (fourth row of grid A). Grid B has 1s in rows5 and6 (second and third rows of grid B). So maybe the 3 in grid A's row3 and the 1 in grid B's rows5 and6. But how does this translate to output row0 column0 being 2?\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's counting the number of times a 3 appears in grid A and a 1 appears in grid B in the same column but in any row. Then, in the output, the 2 is placed in the topmost row of the column where this occurs. But in Example0's column0, there is one 3 and two 1s. So perhaps the output's row0 (top row) gets a 2 for each occurrence. But why three 2s in the first row of Example0?\n\nWait, perhaps each 3 in grid A's column and each 1 in grid B's column contribute to a 2 in the output's column, but the row is determined by the sum of their positions. For example, if a 3 is in grid A row i and a 1 is in grid B row j, then the output row (i + j) mod 4 would have a 2 in that column. Let's test this.\n\nIn Example0, grid A's column0 has a 3 in row3 (i=3). Grid B's column0 has 1s in rows5 and6. Since grid B is rows4-7 of the input, which are rows0-3 in grid B. So grid B's rows are 0 (input row4), 1 (row5), 2 (row6), 3 (row7). So the 1s are in grid B's rows1 and2. So for i=3 (grid A row3) and j=1 (grid B row1), (3+1)=4 mod4=0. So output row0, column0 would get a 2. Similarly, for j=2 (grid B row2), 3+2=5 mod4=1. So output row1, column0 gets a 2. But in Example0's output, column0 has 2 in row0 and 0 in row1. So this might explain one of the 2s. But there are two 1s in grid B column0, leading to two 2s. But in Example0's output column0, there's only one 2 (in row0). So perhaps this isn't the case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the row in the output is determined by the minimum of the rows from grid A and grid B where the 3 and 1 are found. For example, in grid A row3 (index3) and grid B row1 (index1). The minimum is 1. So output row1. But Example0's output column0 has 2 in row0. So this doesn't fit.\n\nThis is getting tricky. Let's try to look for another pattern.\n\nLooking at the Test Input:\n\nTest Input:\n\n[0,3,0,3]  // row0\n[3,3,3,0]  // row1\n[0,0,0,3]  // row2\n[3,3,3,0]  // row3\n// Grid A (rows0-3)\n[0,0,1,1]  // row4\n[0,0,1,1]  // row5\n[0,1,0,0]  // row6\n[1,1,0,0]  // row7\n// Grid B (rows4-7)\n\nThe output should be 4 rows. Let's try to apply whatever pattern we find.\n\nBut to find the pattern, perhaps looking for the number of 2s in the output and their positions.\n\nWait, another observation: In all the examples, the output is a 4x4 grid where each cell is 0 or 2. So the transformation results in either 0 or 2.\n\nLooking at Example0's output: three 2s in row0 and one in row3.\n\nExample1: two 2s in rows1 and2, and two in row3.\n\nExample2: two 2s in rows1 and2.\n\nExample3: one 2 in row2.\n\nSo perhaps the 2s are placed in rows that correspond to the sum or difference of certain rows in the input grids. Or maybe the 2s are placed where in the same column, grid A has a certain number of 3s and grid B has a certain number of 1s.\n\nLet me try counting for each column in the examples:\n\nTake Example0:\n\nColumn0:\n\nGrid A: 0,0,0,3 \u2192 1 three.\nGrid B: 0,1,1,0 \u2192 2 ones.\n\nOutput column0: 2,0,0,0 \u2192 one 2 in row0.\n\nColumn1:\n\nGrid A: 0,3,0,0 \u2192 1 three.\nGrid B:0,0,1,1 \u2192 2 ones.\n\nOutput column1: 2,0,0,0 \u2192 2 in row0.\n\nColumn2:\n\nGrid A:0,3,0,0 \u21921 three.\nGrid B:0,1,1,0 \u21922 ones.\n\nOutput column2: 2,0,0,2 \u2192 2 in row0 and row3.\n\nWait, output column2 in Example0 is [2,0,0,0] (row0) and row3 is 2. Wait, no, output for Example0 is:\n\n[2,2,2,0]\n[0,0,0,0]\n[0,0,0,0]\n[0,0,2,0]\n\nSo column2 has 2 in row0 and row3.\n\nHmm. So column2 in grid A has one 3 (row1, column2). Grid B column2 has two 1s (row5 and row6). So 1 three and 2 ones. How does that result in two 2s in the output column?\n\nSimilarly, column3 in grid A for Example0: 0,0,0,3 \u2192 1 three. Grid B column3:1,1,1,1 \u21924 ones. Output column3 has 0 in row0 and 0 elsewhere. So this doesn't fit a simple sum.\n\nAlternative theory: For each column, the number of 2s in the output is the number of pairs of a 3 in grid A and a 1 in grid B in that column. For example, in column0 of Example0: 1 three and 2 ones \u2192 1*2=2 pairs. But output column0 has one 2. So maybe it's the minimum of the count of 3s in A and 1s in B. For column0: min(1,2)=1 \u2192 one 2. That matches. Column2: min(1,2)=1 \u2192 but output has two 2s. So this doesn't hold.\n\nAlternatively, the number of 2s in a column is the minimum of the count of 3s in grid A and 1s in grid B. For Example0, column0: min(1,2)=1 \u2192 one 2. column1: min(1,2)=1 \u2192 but output has one 2. column2: min(1,2)=1 \u2192 but output has two 2s. column3: min(1,4)=1 \u2192 but output has zero. So this theory doesn't fit.\n\nAnother idea: The output counts how many times a 3 in grid A is above a 1 in grid B in the same column. For example, if in column0 of grid A, there's a 3 in row3, and in grid B's column0, there are 1s in row1 and2 (input rows5 and6), then for each such 1 below the 3, a 2 is added in the output. But how does this translate to the output's row?\n\nAlternatively, for each 3 in grid A's column, if there's a 1 in grid B's same column but in any row below it, then the output row corresponding to the grid B's row gets a 2. For example, in grid A row3 (index3) column0 has 3. Grid B's column0 has 1s in rows1 and2 (input rows5 and6). So output rows1 and2, column0 would get 2s. But in Example0's output, column0 has a 2 in row0, not rows1 or2. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output row is determined by the sum of the grid A row index and grid B row index modulo 4. For example, if a 3 is in grid A row i and a 1 is in grid B row j, then the output row is (i + j) mod4. Let's test this for Example0.\n\nGrid A row3 column0: 3. Grid B rows5 and6 (j=1 and2 in grid B's indexing). So i=3, j=1 \u2192 (3+1)=4 mod4=0. So output row0, column0 gets 2. Similarly, j=2 \u2192 3+2=5 mod4=1. Output row1, column0 gets 2. But in Example0's output, column0 has a 2 in row0 but not row1. So this might explain one of the 2s, but there's another 1 in grid B's column0 (row5, j=1) which would also lead to row0. So two instances of 3 in grid A and 1 in grid B would result in two 2s in row0. But Example0's column0 has only one 2. So maybe overlapping entries?\n\nBut wait, grid A's column0 has one 3, and grid B's column0 has two 1s. So there are two pairs. Each pair contributes a 2 in the output row determined by (i + j) mod4. For these two pairs:\n\ni=3 (grid A row3), j=1 (grid B row1): 3+1=4 mod4=0 \u2192 row0.\ni=3, j=2 (grid B row2): 3+2=5 mod4=1 \u2192 row1.\n\nSo output column0 would have 2s in row0 and row1. But Example0's output column0 has only one 2 in row0. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the row is determined by the grid A row. For example, if a 3 is in grid A row i, then the output row is i. But in Example0's grid A row3 has a 3 in column0. So output row3, column0 would be 2. But in Example0's output row3, column0 is 0, and column2 is 2. So that doesn't fit.\n\nLet's try to think of this as a matrix multiplication problem, but with custom operations. For example, each output cell (i,j) is 2 if there's a 3 in grid A's column j and a 1 in grid B's row i. But how?\n\nAlternatively, the output is the product of grid A's columns and grid B's rows. For example, the number of 3s in grid A's column j multiplied by the number of 1s in grid B's row i. But then for Example0, output row0 would be:\n\nFor j=0: 1 (3s) * 1 (row0 of grid B has one 1) =1 \u2192 but output is 2.\nNot matching.\n\nThis is getting frustrating. Maybe I need to look for another pattern.\n\nLet me try to look at the Test Input and see if I can find a pattern that applies to it, given the training examples.\n\nTest Input:\n\nGrid A (rows0-3):\nRow0: [0,3,0,3]\nRow1: [3,3,3,0]\nRow2: [0,0,0,3]\nRow3: [3,3,3,0]\n\nGrid B (rows4-7):\nRow4: [0,0,1,1]\nRow5: [0,0,1,1]\nRow6: [0,1,0,0]\nRow7: [1,1,0,0]\n\nLet's try to see where the 2s might appear in the output. For that, perhaps the pattern involves the presence of 3s in grid A and 1s in grid B in the same column. Let's check each column:\n\nColumn0:\n\nGrid A: 0,3,0,3 \u2192 two 3s.\nGrid B:0,0,0,1 \u2192 one 1 (row7, which is grid B row3).\n\nSo two 3s and one 1. Maybe output column0 has one 2.\n\nColumn1:\n\nGrid A:3,3,0,3 \u2192 three 3s.\nGrid B:0,0,1,1 \u2192 two 1s (rows6 and7).\n\nSo three 3s and two 1s. Output column1 would have two 2s.\n\nColumn2:\n\nGrid A:0,3,0,3 \u2192 two 3s.\nGrid B:1,1,0,0 \u2192 two 1s (rows4 and5).\n\nTwo 3s and two 1s. Output column2 would have two 2s.\n\nColumn3:\n\nGrid A:3,0,3,0 \u2192 two 3s.\nGrid B:1,1,0,0 \u2192 two 1s (rows4 and5).\n\nTwo 3s and two 1s. Output column3 would have two 2s.\n\nBut how are these distributed in the output rows?\n\nLooking at the training examples, the 2s seem to be placed in the earliest possible rows. For example, in Example0's column0, the 2 is in row0. In Example1, the first 2s are in row1 and row2.\n\nMaybe for each pair of 3 in grid A and 1 in grid B in the same column, the 2 is placed in the row corresponding to the grid B's row index. For example, if a 1 is in grid B's row i (input row 4+i), then the output row is i. Let's check Example0.\n\nIn Example0, grid B's 1s are in rows4 (0),5 (1),6 (2), etc.\n\nGrid B column0 has 1s in rows5 and6 (grid B rows1 and2). So output rows1 and2 would have 2s in column0. But in Example0's output, column0 has 2 in row0. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output row is determined by the sum of the grid A row and grid B row for the same column. For example, if a 3 is in grid A row i and a 1 is in grid B row j (of the same column), then output row (i + j) mod4 gets a 2. Let's test this with Example0's column0.\n\nGrid A row3 (i=3) and grid B rows1 (j=1) and2 (j=2).\n\nFor j=1: 3+1=4 mod4=0 \u2192 output row0, column0 gets a 2.\nFor j=2: 3+2=5 mod4=1 \u2192 output row1, column0 gets a 2.\n\nBut Example0's output column0 has a 2 in row0 and none in row1. So this theory doesn't fit.\n\nThis is really challenging. Let's try to think differently. Maybe the output is a result of some kind of matching between the two grids, perhaps checking for certain sequences or patterns.\n\nLooking at Example0's output, the first row has three 2s. Grid B's first row (row4) is [0,0,0,1]. So all zeros except the last element. Maybe the number of 0s in grid B's row translates to the number of 2s in the output row. For Example0's grid B row4 has three 0s \u2192 three 2s in output row0. That matches. And the last element is 1, which becomes 0 in output. So maybe for each row in grid B, the number of 0s becomes 2s in the corresponding output row, and 1s become 0s. Let's check other examples.\n\nExample1's output row0: [0,0,0,0]. Grid B row4 is [0,0,0,1], which has three 0s. But output row0 is all zeros. So this theory is invalid.\n\nHmm. Back to square one.\n\nAnother observation: The outputs have 2s in certain positions, but what do those positions have in common across all examples? Maybe the 2s are placed where, in the same column, grid A has at least one 3 and grid B has at least one 1, and the row in the output is determined by some function of their positions.\n\nWait, in Example0's output row0 has three 2s. Let's check each column:\n\nColumn0: grid A has a 3 (row3), grid B has 1s (rows5 and6). So yes.\nColumn1: grid A has a 3 (row1), grid B has 1s (rows6 and7).\nColumn2: grid A has a 3 (row1), grid B has 1s (rows5 and6).\nColumn3: grid A has a 3 (row3), grid B has 1s (row4,5,6,7).\n\nSo for each of the first three columns, there's at least one 3 in grid A and at least one 1 in grid B. The output row0 has 2s in these columns. But why row0? What's special about row0.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output row0 is the count of columns where there's at least one 3 in grid A and at least one 1 in grid B. But in Example0, columns0-3 all have 3s and 1s except column3 has 3s and 1s as well. But output row0's column3 is 0. So this doesn't fit.\n\nWait, in Example0's column3, grid A has a 3 in row3, and grid B has four 1s. So why output row0's column3 is 0? This contradicts the earlier idea.\n\nThis is really perplexing. Maybe I'm missing something obvious. Let's try to think of the output as the result of some kind of collision or interaction between the two grids in a specific way.\n\nAnother thought: The problem might be similar to the game of Tetris or some tile-matching game where certain combinations lead to cleared lines. For instance, if a column in grid A has a 3 and the same column in grid B has a 1, the output marks where they overlap in some way. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is generated by vertically stacking grid A and grid B, then applying a rule that wherever a 3 is directly above a 1 in the same column, a 2 is placed in the output. But since the grids are separate, not stacked, this might not make sense. However, if we imagine grid A is on top of grid B, then for each column, if there's a 3 in grid A and a 1 in grid B in the same column, regardless of row, then output the number of such pairs. But again, how this maps to the output rows.\n\nAlternatively, the output might be a heatmap where each cell represents the number of times a 3 in grid A and a 1 in grid B appear in the same column, regardless of row. But in Example0, column0 has one 3 and two 1s \u2192 two pairs, so output would be 2. But output's column0 has 2 in row0. But how does that translate to a single 2 in row0.\n\nThis is really challenging. Let's try to look at another example.\n\nExample3:\n\nInput:\n\nGrid A:\n[3,3,3,3]\n[3,0,0,0]\n[3,0,3,3]\n[3,3,0,3]\n\nGrid B:\n[1,1,1,0]\n[0,1,1,1]\n[1,0,1,1]\n[0,1,1,1]\n\nOutput:\n[0,0,0,0]\n[0,0,0,0]\n[0,2,0,0]\n[0,0,0,0]\n\nLooking at the output, the only 2 is in row2 column1.\n\nGrid A's column1: 3 (row0),0 (row1),0 (row2),3 (row3) \u2192 two 3s.\n\nGrid B's column1:1 (row4),1 (row5),0 (row6),1 (row7) \u2192 three 1s.\n\nSo in column1, there are two 3s and three 1s. Output row2 column1 has a 2. What's special about this position?\n\nLooking at grid B's column1, the 1s are in rows4,5,7 (grid B rows0,1,3). So three 1s. Grid A's column1 has 3s in rows0 and3.\n\nMaybe for each pair of 3 in grid A and 1 in grid B in the same column, the output row is the average of their row indices. For example, if a 3 is in grid A row0 (i=0) and a 1 is in grid B row0 (j=0), then output row (0+0)/2=0. But output row0 has 0. So maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, the output row is the grid B's row index where the 1 is located. For example, if a 3 is in grid A column1 and a 1 is in grid B column1 row5 (j=1), then output row1. But in Example3's output, the 2 is in row2. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, the output row is determined by the number of 3s and 1s in the column. For example, if a column has m 3s and n 1s, then the output rows for that column are filled with 2s starting from the top, up to the minimum of m and n. So if m=2 and n=3, then two 2s in the top two rows. But in Example3's output for column1, there's one 2 in row2. So this doesn't fit.\n\nI'm stuck. Let's try to make a hypothesis based on the Test Input and see if it aligns with the training examples.\n\nTest Input:\n\nGrid A:\nRow0: [0,3,0,3]\nRow1: [3,3,3,0]\nRow2: [0,0,0,3]\nRow3: [3,3,3,0]\n\nGrid B:\nRow4: [0,0,1,1]\nRow5: [0,0,1,1]\nRow6: [0,1,0,0]\nRow7: [1,1,0,0]\n\nFor each column:\n\nColumn0: grid A has 0,3,0,3 \u2192 two 3s. Grid B has 0,0,0,1 \u2192 one 1 (row7). So two 3s and one 1. Maybe output has one 2 in this column.\n\nColumn1: grid A has 3,3,0,3 \u2192 three 3s. Grid B has 0,0,1,1 \u2192 two 1s (rows6 and7). So three 3s and two 1s. Output has two 2s.\n\nColumn2: grid A has 0,3,0,3 \u2192 two 3s. Grid B has 1,1,0,0 \u2192 two 1s (rows4 and5). So two pairs \u2192 two 2s.\n\nColumn3: grid A has 3,0,3,0 \u2192 two 3s. Grid B has 1,1,0,0 \u2192 two 1s (rows4 and5). So two pairs \u2192 two 2s.\n\nNow, how to distribute these 2s in the output rows. Let's look for a pattern in the training examples.\n\nExample0's output has three 2s in row0 and one in row3. So maybe the 2s are placed in the lowest possible row where the pair occurs. Or perhaps the earliest.\n\nAlternatively, for each column, the number of 2s equals the minimum between the count of 3s in grid A and 1s in grid B. And the 2s are placed in the first k rows of that column, where k is the minimum. For example:\n\nTest Input column0: min(2,1)=1 \u2192 one 2 in row0.\n\ncolumn1: min(3,2)=2 \u2192 two 2s in rows0 and1.\n\ncolumn2: min(2,2)=2 \u2192 two 2s in rows0 and1.\n\ncolumn3: min(2,2)=2 \u2192 two 2s in rows0 and1.\n\nBut Example0's column0 has one 2 in row0. That fits. Column1 has one 2 in row0. But min(1,2)=1. So one 2. Which fits.\n\nExample1's column0: grid A has 3,0,0,3 \u2192 two 3s. Grid B has 0,0,0,1 \u2192 one 1. min(2,1)=1 \u2192 one 2. Output column0 has two 2s in rows1 and2. Doesn't fit.\n\nSo this theory doesn't hold.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 2s are placed in the output rows corresponding to the number of 1s in grid B for that column. For example, if a column in grid B has two 1s, then two 2s are placed in the output's first two rows. But in Example0's column0, grid B has two 1s, and output has one 2. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAt this point, I'm not making progress. Let's try to make an educated guess based on the Test Input and the examples.\n\nLooking at the Test Input's grid B rows:\n\nRow4: [0,0,1,1] \u2192 two 1s in columns2 and3.\nRow5: [0,0,1,1] \u2192 same as row4.\nRow6: [0,1,0,0] \u2192 one 1 in column1.\nRow7: [1,1,0,0] \u2192 two 1s in columns0 and1.\n\nSo for each column in grid B:\n\nColumn0: 1 in row7.\nColumn1: 1s in rows6 and7.\nColumn2: 1s in rows4 and5.\nColumn3: 1s in rows4 and5.\n\nNow, grid A's columns:\n\nColumn0: 3s in rows1 and3.\nColumn1: 3s in rows0,1,3.\nColumn2: 3s in rows1 and3.\nColumn3: 3s in rows0 and2.\n\nSo, for each column j, the number of 3s in grid A and 1s in grid B:\n\nCol0: 2 3s, 1 1 \u2192 min is 1 \u2192 one 2.\nCol1: 3 3s, 2 1s \u2192 min is 2 \u2192 two 2s.\nCol2: 2 3s, 2 1s \u2192 min is 2 \u2192 two 2s.\nCol3: 2 3s, 2 1s \u2192 min is 2 \u2192 two 2s.\n\nTotal 1+2+2+2=7 2s. But each output has 4 rows. So where are these 2s placed?\n\nLooking at Example0, the output has 4 2s. Example1 has 4. Example2 has 2. Example3 has 1. So the number varies.\n\nPerhaps the 2s are placed in the output rows corresponding to the number of pairs. For example, in Test Input's column1 (min 2), the output would have 2 2s in the first two rows of that column.\n\nBut how to determine the rows for each column.\n\nAlternatively, for each pair of 3 in grid A and 1 in grid B in the same column, the output row is determined by the sum of the row indices of the 3 and the 1 modulo 4. But this requires knowing which rows they are in.\n\nFor Test Input's column0:\n\nGrid A's 3s are in rows1 and3.\nGrid B's 1 is in row7 (grid B's row3).\n\nSo pairs are (A row1, B row3) and (A row3, B row3).\n\nSum row indices (A is rows0-3, B is rows4-7 \u2192 but perhaps within their own grids).\n\nIf in grid A, rows are 0-3, and grid B rows are 0-3 (input rows4-7).\n\nFor pair (A row1, B row3):\n\nsum =1 +3=4 \u2192 mod4=0 \u2192 output row0.\n\npair (A row3, B row3):\n\nsum=3+3=6 mod4=2 \u2192 output row2.\n\nSo in column0, output rows0 and2 would have 2s.\n\nBut according to earlier count, column0 has one pair (since grid B has one 1). So perhaps one 2. But according to this, two 2s.\n\nThis is conflicting.\n\nAt this point, I think the correct approach is to look for the following pattern:\n\nThe output is generated by overlaying the two grids (A and B) and wherever there's a 3 in grid A and a 1 in grid B in the same column, a 2 is placed in the output's corresponding row, which is determined by the sum of the row indices of the 3 and the 1 modulo 4.\n\nBut I need to verify this with the training examples.\n\nLet's take Example0:\n\nGrid A's 3s are in rows1,1,3,3 (columns1,2,0,3).\nGrid B's 1s are in rows4 (3),5 (0,2,3),6 (0,1,2,3),7 (1,3).\n\nFor each 3 in grid A and 1 in grid B in the same column:\n\nFor example, grid A row1, column1 (3) and grid B row5, column1 (0) \u2192 no.\n\nGrid A row1, column2 (3) and grid B row5, column2 (1) \u2192 same column. So sum row1 (A) + row5 (B's row is 1, since B's rows are 0-3). So 1 +1=2 mod4=2 \u2192 output row2, column2 would have 2. But Example0's output row2 is all zeros. So this doesn't fit.\n\nThis approach isn't working.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and lack of progress, I'll make an educated guess based on the Test Input and the examples.\n\nLooking at the Test Input's grid B, rows4 and5 have two 1s in columns2 and3. Rows6 and7 have 1s in columns1 and0/1.\n\nThe output might have 2s in rows corresponding to the grid B's rows where the 1s are present, but only if there's a 3 in grid A's corresponding column.\n\nFor example, in Test Input's column2:\n\nGrid B has 1s in rows4 and5 (grid B's rows0 and1). Grid A has 3s in rows1 and3. So output rows0 and1 would have 2s in column2.\n\nSimilarly, column3 has 1s in grid B's rows0 and1. So output rows0 and1, column3 have 2s.\n\nColumn1 has 1s in grid B's rows2 and3 (input rows6 and7 \u2192 grid B's rows2 and3). So output rows2 and3, column1 have 2s.\n\nColumn0 has a 1 in grid B's row3 (input row7 \u2192 grid B's row3). Grid A has 3s in rows1 and3. So output row3 (1+3 mod4=0?), but not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the output row is the same as the grid B's row index where the 1 is located.\n\nSo for Test Input's column2, grid B's rows0 and1 (input rows4 and5) have 1s. So output rows0 and1, column2 would have 2s.\n\nSimilarly, column3: output rows0 and1 have 2s.\n\nColumn1: grid B's rows2 and3 (input rows6 and7) have 1s. Output rows2 and3, column1.\n\nColumn0: grid B's row3 (input row7) has 1. So output row3, column0.\n\nPutting this together:\n\nOutput rows:\n\nRow0: [0,0,2,2]\n\nRow1: [0,0,2,2]\n\nRow2: [0,2,0,0]\n\nRow3: [2,2,0,0]\n\nBut none of the training examples have 2s in multiple columns of the same row like this.\n\nLooking at Example1's output:\n\n[0,0,0,0]\n[2,0,0,0]\n[2,0,0,0]\n[0,2,2,0]\n\nHere, column0 has 2s in rows1 and2. Column1 and2 have 2s in row3.\n\nThis might correspond to grid B's rows1 and2 (input rows5 and6) for column0, and rows3 (input row7) for columns1 and2.\n\nSo the output rows correspond to the grid B's row indices.\n\nIf that's the case, then for Test Input's grid B:\n\nRow0 (input row4) has 1s in columns2 and3 \u2192 output row0 columns2 and3 are 2s.\n\nRow1 (input row5) has 1s in columns2 and3 \u2192 output row1 columns2 and3 are 2s.\n\nRow2 (input row6) has 1 in column1 \u2192 output row2 column1 is 2.\n\nRow3 (input row7) has 1s in columns0 and1 \u2192 output row3 columns0 and1 are 2s.\n\nSo the output would be:\n\nRow0: [0,0,2,2]\n\nRow1: [0,0,2,2]\n\nRow2: [0,2,0,0]\n\nRow3: [2,2,0,0]\n\nBut looking at the training examples, this structure doesn't match. For example, Example0's output has 2s in row0, which would correspond to grid B's row0 (input row4) which has a 1 in column3. But the output row0 has 2s in columns0-2, not column3.\n\nSo this theory is invalid.\n\nGiven that I'm time-constrained and need to provide an answer, I'll make a final guess based on the Test Input and the examples.\n\nLooking at the Test Input's grid A and B:\n\nGrid A has 3s in various positions, and grid B has 1s in columns0,1,2,3. The output likely has 2s in rows corresponding to the rows in grid B where the 1s are present, but only if there's a 3 in the same column in grid A. For example, grid B row4 (grid B row0) has 1s in columns2 and3. If grid A's columns2 and3 have 3s, then output row0, columns2 and3 are 2s.\n\nGrid A's column2 has 3s in rows1 and3. So yes. Grid A's column3 has 3s in rows0 and2. So output row0, columns2 and3 are 2s.\n\nSimilarly, grid B row5 (row1) has 1s in columns2 and3. So output row1, columns2 and3 are 2s.\n\nGrid B row6 (row2) has 1 in column1. Grid A's column1 has 3s in rows0,1,3. So output row2, column1 has 2.\n\nGrid B row7 (row3) has 1s in columns0 and1. Grid A's columns0 and1 have 3s. So output row3, columns0 and1 are 2s.\n\nThus, the output would be:\n\n[0,0,2,2]\n[0,0,2,2]\n[0,2,0,0]\n[2,2,0,0]\n\nBut looking at the training examples, this format doesn't match. For example, Example0's output has three 2s in row0, which would imply that grid B's row0 has three 1s, but grid B row0 in Example0 has only one 1.\n\nSo this pattern doesn't hold across the training examples. Therefore, I'm likely missing something.\n\nAfter much consideration, I'll proceed to provide an answer that seems to fit the test input based on the training examples. Given the examples, the outputs often have 2s where there's a combination of 3s in the first grid and 1s in the second grid, possibly in the same column but different rows. For the test input, this would likely result in 2s in columns 2 and 3 of the first two rows, and columns 0 and 1 of the last two rows. But given the uncertainty, I'll present the following output based on the pattern I think is most plausible.",

        "cot_2": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. So, we have these input grids and output grids. The outputs are 4x4 grids, but the inputs are 8 rows. Wait, each input is 8 rows of 4 elements each, and the output is 4 rows of 4. So maybe the input is divided into two parts: the first four rows and the next four, and the output combines them somehow?\n\nLooking at Example 0:\n\nInput starts with:\n[0,0,0,0]\n[0,3,3,0]\n[0,0,0,0]\n[3,0,0,3]\nThen the next four:\n[0,0,0,1]\n[1,0,1,1]\n[1,1,1,1]\n[0,1,0,1]\n\nOutput is:\n[2,2,2,0]\n[0,0,0,0]\n[0,0,0,0]\n[0,0,2,0]\n\nHmm. Let's compare the two halves. The first four rows have numbers 0 and 3. The next four have 0,1. The output has 0,2. Maybe the output is generated by comparing the corresponding elements from the two halves of the input. Like, for each position (i,j), take the first half's row i and the second half's row i, and apply some operation.\n\nWait, but the input has 8 rows, so perhaps the first four rows are one matrix (let's call it A) and the next four another matrix (B). Then the output is a matrix where each cell is determined by the corresponding cells in A and B.\n\nLooking at Example 0's output first row: [2,2,2,0]. Let's check the first row of A and B:\n\nA row 0: [0,0,0,0]\nB row 0: [0,0,0,1]\n\nSo for each element in the output row 0, if the A element and B element are 0 and 0, maybe 2? But let's check:\n\nOutput row 0 is [2,2,2,0]. The first three elements are 2, and the last is 0. Let's see:\n\nA row 0: [0,0,0,0]\nB row 0: [0,0,0,1]\n\nSo positions 0,1,2 in A are 0 and in B are 0, 0, 0 (since B row 0 is [0,0,0,1]). So for those three positions, A is 0 and B is 0, and output is 2. Then position 3: A is 0, B is 1 \u2192 output is 0. So maybe when A's cell is 0 and B's is 0, output is 2. If A is 0 and B is 1, output is 0. What about other combinations?\n\nLooking at Example 0's output row 3: [0,0,2,0]. Let's see A row 3 and B row 3.\n\nA row3: [3,0,0,3]\nB row3: [0,1,0,1]\n\nOutput row3: [0,0,2,0].\n\nSo for the third row, let's look at each column:\n\nColumn 0: A=3, B=0 \u2192 output 0\nColumn1: A=0, B=1 \u2192 output 0\nColumn2: A=0, B=0 \u2192 output 2?\nYes, that matches. Then column3: A=3, B=1 \u2192 output 0.\n\nSo the rule seems to be: if in the same position (row and column), the A matrix (first four rows) has 0 and the B matrix (next four rows) has 0, then output 2. Otherwise, if either A or B is non-zero (3 or 1), then output 0. Wait, but in Example 0's output, the first row has three 2s where both A and B (row0) have 0s except the last element where B is 1, so output 0.\n\nBut let's check another example. Example1's output:\n\nOutput is:\n\n[0,0,0,0]\n[2,0,0,0]\n[2,0,0,0]\n[0,2,2,0]\n\nLooking at the first row of output. The A matrix row0 is [3,3,3,3], B row0 is [0,0,0,1]. So A is all 3s. So in this case, output row0 is all 0s. Because none of the positions have A=0 and B=0. So the 2s only come where A=0 and B=0.\n\nBut in example1's output row1 is [2,0,0,0]. Let's check the corresponding rows in A and B:\n\nA row1 is [0,3,3,0], B row1 is [0,0,0,1]. So A row1, column0 is 0, B row1 column0 is 0 \u2192 output is 2. The other columns in A row1 are 3,3,0 (but B row1 columns 1-3 are 0,0,1). So for column0: 0 and 0 \u2192 2. Other columns in row1 of output are 0,0,0. So that fits.\n\nSo the pattern seems to be: for each cell (i,j), if the cell in the first four rows (A) is 0 and the cell in the next four rows (B) is 0, then output 2. Otherwise, output 0. But wait, let's check other examples.\n\nExample2's output:\n\n[0,0,0,0]\n[0,0,2,0]\n[0,0,0,2]\n[0,0,0,0]\n\nLooking at the input for Example2:\n\nFirst four rows (A matrix):\n\n[0,3,3,0]\n[0,3,0,3]\n[0,0,3,0]\n[3,3,3,3]\n\nB matrix (next four):\n\n[1,1,1,1]\n[1,1,0,0]\n[1,1,0,0]\n[0,1,1,0]\n\nOutput row1: [0,0,2,0]. Let's check row1 in A and B:\n\nA row1 is [0,3,0,3], B row1 is [1,1,0,0].\n\nSo for column2: A is 0, B is 0 \u2192 output 2. So that's why the third element in output row1 is 2. Others are 0 because either A or B is non-zero.\n\nSimilarly, output row2 is [0,0,0,2]. A row2 is [0,0,3,0], B row2 is [1,1,0,0]. Column3 in A is 0, B row2 column3 is 0? Wait, B row2 is [1,1,0,0], so column3 (index 3) is 0. So A's column3 in row2 is 0 (A row2 is [0,0,3,0]). So A and B are 0 and 0 \u2192 output 2. So in row2, column3 is 2. But in the output row2, the last element is 2. So yes, that matches.\n\nSo the rule seems to hold here.\n\nNow, looking at Example3's output:\n\nOutput is:\n\n[0,0,0,0]\n[0,0,0,0]\n[0,2,0,0]\n[0,0,0,0]\n\nInput's A matrix is:\n\n[3,3,3,3]\n[3,0,0,0]\n[3,0,3,3]\n[3,3,0,3]\n\nB matrix:\n\n[1,1,1,0]\n[0,1,1,1]\n[1,0,1,1]\n[0,1,1,1]\n\nLooking at output row2: [0,2,0,0]. So for row2 in A and B:\n\nA row2: [3,0,3,3]\nB row2: [1,0,1,1]\n\nSo column1 in A is 0, B column1 is 0 \u2192 output 2. So that's where the 2 comes from. Other positions in row2: A and B have at least one non-zero, so output 0.\n\nSo the pattern is confirmed. The output is 2 wherever the corresponding cells in the first four rows (A) and the next four rows (B) are both 0. All other positions are 0.\n\nWait, but let's check for the test input.\n\nTest input:\n\n[0,3,0,3] \u2192 row0 of A\n[3,3,3,0] \u2192 row1 of A\n[0,0,0,3] \u2192 row2 of A\n[3,3,3,0] \u2192 row3 of A\nThen B matrix:\n[0,0,1,1] \u2192 row0 of B\n[0,0,1,1] \u2192 row1 of B\n[0,1,0,0] \u2192 row2 of B\n[1,1,0,0] \u2192 row3 of B\n\nSo for each cell (i,j), check if A[i][j] is 0 and B[i][j] is 0. If yes, output 2, else 0.\n\nLet's process each row:\n\nOutput row0 (i=0):\n\nA row0: [0,3,0,3]\nB row0: [0,0,1,1]\n\nCheck each column:\n\nj=0: A is 0, B is 0 \u2192 2\nj=1: A is3, B is0 \u2192 no \u2192 0\nj=2: A is0, B is1 \u2192 no \u21920\nj=3: A is3, B is1 \u2192 no \u21920\nSo output row0: [2,0,0,0]\n\nRow1 (i=1):\n\nA row1: [3,3,3,0]\nB row1: [0,0,1,1]\n\nCheck each column:\n\nj0:3 and 0 \u2192 0\nj1:3 and0 \u21920\nj2:3 and1 \u21920\nj3:0 and1 \u21920 \u21920\nSo row1: [0,0,0,0]\n\nRow2 (i=2):\n\nA row2: [0,0,0,3]\nB row2: [0,1,0,0]\n\nCheck each column:\n\nj0:0 and0 \u21922\nj1:0 and1 \u21920\nj2:0 and0 \u21922\nj3:3 and0 \u21920\nSo row2: [2,0,2,0]\n\nRow3 (i=3):\n\nA row3: [3,3,3,0]\nB row3: [1,1,0,0]\n\nCheck columns:\n\nj0:3 and1 \u21920\nj1:3 and1 \u21920\nj2:3 and0 \u21920\nj3:0 and0 \u21922\nSo row3: [0,0,0,2]\n\nSo putting it all together, the output should be:\n\n[2,0,0,0]\n[0,0,0,0]\n[2,0,2,0]\n[0,0,0,2]\n\nWait, but looking at the training examples, all the outputs are 4 rows. Let me check if the rows are arranged correctly.\n\nWait, the examples have output as 4 rows. So the test input's output should be four rows. Let's re-express:\n\nRow0: [2,0,0,0]\nRow1: [0,0,0,0]\nRow2: [2,0,2,0]\nRow3: [0,0,0,2]\n\nBut looking at the training examples, like Example0's output has four rows, each of length 4. So this seems correct. So the answer should be:\n\n[2,0,0,0]\n[0,0,0,0]\n[2,0,2,0]\n[0,0,0,2]\n\nBut let me cross-verify once again.\n\nAnother way to check: for each cell (i,j) in the output, if A[i][j] is 0 and B[i][j] is 0 \u2192 2, else 0.\n\nTest input's A and B matrices:\n\nA matrix (rows 0-3):\n\nRow0: [0,3,0,3]\nRow1: [3,3,3,0]\nRow2: [0,0,0,3]\nRow3: [3,3,3,0]\n\nB matrix (rows 4-7, which are input rows 4-7):\n\nRow0: [0,0,1,1]\nRow1: [0,0,1,1]\nRow2: [0,1,0,0]\nRow3: [1,1,0,0]\n\nSo:\n\nFor output row0:\n\nCheck (0,0): 0 and 0 \u2192 2\n(0,1):3 and0 \u21920\n(0,2):0 and1 \u21920\n(0,3):3 and1 \u21920 \u2192 [2,0,0,0]\n\nRow1:\n\n(1,0):3 and0 \u21920\n(1,1):3 and0 \u21920\n(1,2):3 and1 \u21920\n(1,3):0 and1 \u21920 \u2192 [0,0,0,0]\n\nRow2:\n\n(2,0):0 and0 \u21922\n(2,1):0 and1 \u21920\n(2,2):0 and0 \u21922\n(2,3):3 and0 \u21920 \u2192 [2,0,2,0]\n\nRow3:\n\n(3,0):3 and1 \u21920\n(3,1):3 and1 \u21920\n(3,2):3 and0 \u21920 (because A is3)\n(3,3):0 and0 \u21922 \u2192 [0,0,0,2]\n\nYes, that's correct. So the output should be as above."
