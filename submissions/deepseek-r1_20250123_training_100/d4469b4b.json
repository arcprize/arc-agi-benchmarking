        "cot_1": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. So, we have these input matrices and their corresponding output matrices. The inputs are 5x5 grids of numbers (0, 1, 2, 3, etc.), and the outputs are 3x3 grids with mostly 0s and 5s.\n\nFirst, let's look at the first example. The input is:\n\n[2, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[0, 2, 0, 0, 2]\n[2, 0, 0, 2, 0]\n[0, 0, 0, 2, 2]\n[0, 0, 2, 2, 0]\n\nOutput is:\n\n[5,5,5]\n[0,5,0]\n[0,5,0]\n\nHmm, the output is a 3x3. Maybe the input is being divided into regions or something. Let's think about how a 5x5 grid could map to a 3x3. Maybe each cell in the 3x3 corresponds to a 3x3 region in the 5x5, but that's 3x3 regions overlapping? Wait, 5 divided into 3 parts... Maybe it's like the middle of the 5x5? Or perhaps each output cell is determined by some pattern in the input's rows or columns.\n\nLooking at the output structures, sometimes the 5s form a vertical line (like in example 0, the middle column is all 5s except the top row), but in others, like example 2, the bottom row is all 5s. Wait, example 0's output has the top row as all 5s and the middle column as 5s. Hmm, maybe it's related to the positions of certain numbers in the input.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is counting occurrences of a certain value in each of the 3x3 regions. But the input has values like 2,3,1, etc., and the output is 5s. So maybe 5 represents a count that's been transformed. For example, if the count of a certain number in a region is 3, maybe 3 is multiplied by something to get 5. But 5 isn't a multiple of 3. Alternatively, maybe 5 is a placeholder for a certain condition being met.\n\nWait, looking at example 1's input:\n\n[0,0,0,0,0]\n[0,0,1,1,1]\n[0,1,0,1,1]\n[0,1,0,1,0]\n[0,0,0,0,1]\n\nThe output is:\n\n[0,5,0]\n[5,5,5]\n[0,5,0]\n\nSo the middle row is all 5s. Maybe the output is determined by the presence of a certain number along rows or columns in the input.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is a 3x3 grid where each cell corresponds to a 3x3 section of the input grid, but overlapped. Let me check. The input is 5x5, so if we take 3x3 regions, starting at positions (0,0), (0,1), (0,2), etc., but with the 5x5, there would be 3x3 possible regions (since 5-3+1=3 in each dimension). So each of the 3x3 output cells could be based on the corresponding 3x3 input region.\n\nBut how? Let's take example 0. Let's look at the input's top-left 3x3 region:\n\nRow 0: [2,0,0]\nRow 1: [0,2,0]\nRow 2: [2,0,0]\n\nWhat's special here? The sum? Let's see sum of each region. For example 0's output first row is [5,5,5]. Maybe each output cell is 5 if the sum of the corresponding input region is a multiple of some number. Let's calculate.\n\nWait, the first region in example 0's input would be rows 0-2, columns 0-2. Sum: 2+0+0 +0+2+0 +2+0+0 = 2+2+2=6. But output cell (0,0) is 5. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe it's the count of the number 2 in that region. In example 0, the first 3x3 region has 3 twos. But 3 isn't 5. So that might not be it.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the presence of a certain number in a specific position. For example, if the center of the 3x3 region is 2, then output 5. But in example 0's first region, the center (row 1, column 1) is 2, but the output cell (0,0) is 5. Wait, but in example 0's output, the first row is all 5s. Let me check each region's center.\n\nWait, maybe each output cell corresponds to the center cell of each possible 3x3 region. The 5x5 input can be split into 3x3 regions centered at (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (2,1), etc. Wait, no. Alternatively, the output grid's cell (i,j) corresponds to the input's cell (i+1, j+1), which is the center. For example, a 3x3 output grid would be the center 3x3 of the input. But the input is 5x5. Let's check example 0's input center 3x3:\n\nRow 1-3, columns 1-3:\n\nRow1: [2,0,0]\nRow2: [0,0,2]\nRow3: [0,0,0]\n\nWait, but the output for example 0 is:\n\n[5,5,5]\n[0,5,0]\n[0,5,0]\n\nSo the center cell (1,1) of the output is 5. If the input's center cell (row2, column2) is 0. That doesn't match. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is determined by the number of times a certain value appears in the rows or columns. For example, in example 0, the input has a lot of 2s. Let's count the 2s in each row of the input:\n\nRow0: 1\nRow1: 3\nRow2: 2\nRow3: 2\nRow4: 2\n\nBut the output is 3 rows. Maybe each output row corresponds to a group of input rows. Like output row 0 is input rows 0-1, row1 is rows2, row2 is rows3-4. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is a transformation based on diagonal or vertical/horizontal lines. Looking at example 0's output, the top row is all 5s, and the middle column is all 5s. So maybe it's combining vertical and horizontal lines. But how does that relate to the input?\n\nWait, maybe the output is a 3x3 grid where each cell represents the count of a certain number in the corresponding row or column. For example, the output's first row might be the count of 2s in the first three rows of the input. Let's check example 0:\n\nInput's first three rows:\n\nRow0: [2,0,0,0,0] \u2192 1 two\nRow1: [0,2,0,0,2] \u2192 2 twos\nRow2: [2,0,0,2,0] \u2192 2 twos\n\nSum of twos in first three rows: 1+2+2=5. But the output's first row is [5,5,5]. Hmm, but 5 in all three positions. Maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the sum of the diagonals of the input. Let's see example 0's input:\n\nThe main diagonal (from top-left to bottom-right) is 2, 2, 0, 2, 0. Sum is 2+2+0+2+0=6. But the output is 3x3. Not sure.\n\nWait, looking at the outputs, sometimes there's a vertical line (like in example 0, the middle column is 5s), sometimes a horizontal line (example 2's output has the bottom row as 5s). So maybe the output is indicating the direction (vertical or horizontal) of a certain pattern in the input.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is a 3x3 grid where each cell checks if the input's row and column have a certain property. For example, in the output, a 5 indicates that the corresponding row and column in the input meet some condition.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is determined by the positions of the maximum numbers in each row or column. For example, if in the input, the maximum in a row is in a certain position, that affects the output.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is a heatmap of where the majority of a certain number is located. For example, if in the input, the number 2 appears mostly in the top rows, the output's top row is all 5s.\n\nAlternatively, let's think about the outputs. The 5s form patterns like a T-shape (as in example 0: top row and middle column) or a horizontal line (example 2's bottom row). Maybe these correspond to the shape formed by the non-zero elements in the input. Let's see example 0's input:\n\nLooking at where the 2s are:\n\nRow0: col0\nRow1: col1, col4\nRow2: col0, col3\nRow3: col3, col4\nRow4: col2, col3\n\nIf I plot these positions, maybe they form a certain shape. But how does that translate to a 3x3 output?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output represents the number of times a certain number appears in each of the nine possible 2x2 blocks of the input. The 5x5 input can be divided into overlapping 2x2 blocks, but that would result in more than 3x3. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe the output is a 3x3 grid where each cell corresponds to a cross (like a plus sign) in the input. For example, each cell in the output represents the sum or count of non-zero elements in a cross-shaped area centered at certain positions in the input.\n\nFor example, the 5x5 input has crosses centered at positions (1,1), (1,3), (3,1), etc. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, looking at example 0's output, the top row is all 5s, which might mean that in the input's top three rows, there's a certain pattern. Let's see the input's first three rows:\n\nRow0: [2,0,0,0,0]\nRow1: [0,2,0,0,2]\nRow2: [2,0,0,2,0]\n\nIf I look for the number 2 in these rows, maybe the count is 5? Let's count the number of 2s in the first three rows: 1 (row0) + 3 (row1) + 2 (row2) = 6. But the output's first row is 5. Not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is related to the positions where the majority of a certain number's occurrences are in the input. For example, if most 2s are in the top part of the input, then the output's top row is 5s.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output's 3x3 grid corresponds to the input's 3x3 center. Wait, the input is 5x5, so the center 3x3 would be rows 1-3 and columns 1-3. Let's see example 0's center 3x3:\n\nRow1: [0,2,0,0,2] \u2192 columns 1-3: 2,0,0\nRow2: [2,0,0,2,0] \u2192 columns 1-3: 0,0,2\nRow3: [0,0,0,2,2] \u2192 columns 1-3:0,0,2\n\nWait, that's not a 3x3. Wait, rows 1-3 (indices 1,2,3) and columns 1-3 (indices 1,2,3):\n\nRow1: 2,0,0 \u2192 sum 2\nRow2:0,0,2 \u2192 sum 2\nRow3:0,0,2 \u2192 sum 2\nTotal sum 6. But the output's middle row is [0,5,0]. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the result of a convolution. For example, applying a kernel over the input to get the output. For example, if the kernel is looking for certain patterns.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is based on the number of times a certain number appears in each of the three vertical slices of the input. For example, the input is divided into three vertical sections (left, middle, right), and the output counts the occurrences. But the input is 5 columns. Maybe divided into left (cols 0-1), middle (col2), right (cols3-4). Let's check example 0:\n\nIn example 0's input:\n\nLeft columns (0-1): in each row:\n\nRow0: 2,0 \u2192 1 two\nRow1:0,2 \u2192 1 two\nRow2:2,0 \u2192 1 two\nRow3:0,0 \u2192 0\nRow4:0,0 \u2192 0\n\nTotal left: 3 twos.\n\nMiddle column (col2): all zeros except row4 (which has 2). So 1 two.\n\nRight columns (3-4):\n\nRow0:0,0 \u21920\nRow1:0,2 \u21921\nRow2:2,0 \u21921\nRow3:2,2 \u21922\nRow4:2,0 \u21921\n\nTotal right: 5 twos.\n\nSo left:3, middle:1, right:5. But the output for example0 is [5,5,5] in the first row, which might not match.\n\nAlternatively, the output's rows might correspond to the input's rows grouped. For example, output rows correspond to input rows 0-1, 2, 3-4. But example0's output has three rows, and input has five. So maybe each output row is the sum of certain input rows.\n\nAlternatively, think of the output as a 3x3 grid where each cell is the sum of the input's row i and column j, modulo something. But not sure.\n\nAnother approach: look at the test input and see what the output might be, then see if that helps find the pattern.\n\nTest input:\n\n[1, 1, 1, 1, 0]\n[0, 0, 1, 0, 1]\n[0, 1, 0, 0, 0]\n[0, 1, 0, 0, 1]\n[0, 0, 1, 0, 0]\n\nLooking at the outputs, the pattern in the training examples often has a horizontal line of 5s in one row and vertical line in others. For example, in example 1, the middle row is all 5s. In example 2, the bottom row is all 5s. So maybe the output depends on the distribution of a certain number (like 1,2,3) in the input.\n\nIn the test input, the number 1 appears in:\n\nRow0: four 1s (indices 0-3)\nRow1: two 1s (indices 2 and4)\nRow2: one 1 (index1)\nRow3: two 1s (indices1 and4)\nRow4: one 1 (index2)\n\nSo total 4+2+1+2+1=10 ones. Not sure if that helps.\n\nLooking at the outputs, when there's a horizontal line (like example 2's bottom row), maybe the input's non-zero elements are concentrated in the bottom part. Let's check example2's input:\n\nInput example2:\n\n[3,0,0,0,0]\n[0,0,0,3,3]\n[0,3,3,0,0]\n[0,3,0,3,0]\n[3,0,3,3,0]\n\nThe 3s are in rows 0,1,2,3,4. But the output is:\n\n[0,0,5]\n[0,0,5]\n[5,5,5]\n\nThe bottom row is all 5s. Maybe the bottom row of the output corresponds to the bottom three rows of the input. Let's see. The bottom three rows (rows 2,3,4):\n\nRow2:0,3,3,0,0 \u2192 two 3s\nRow3:0,3,0,3,0 \u2192 two 3s\nRow4:3,0,3,3,0 \u2192 three 3s\n\nSum: 2+2+3=7. Not sure. But the output's bottom row has 5s. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is determined by the number of times a certain value appears in each of the three horizontal bands (top, middle, bottom) of the input. For example, top band (rows 0-1), middle (row2), bottom (rows3-4). Let's check example0's input:\n\nTop band (rows0-1):\n\nRow0: 2,0,0,0,0 \u2192 1 two\nRow1:0,2,0,0,2 \u2192 2 twos\nTotal: 3 twos\n\nMiddle (row2):2 twos\n\nBottom band (rows3-4):\n\nRow3:0,0,0,2,2 \u2192 2 twos\nRow4:0,0,2,2,0 \u2192 2 twos\nTotal:4 twos\n\nBut example0's output first row is all 5s, which would correspond to the top band. 3 twos \u2192 5? Maybe 3+2=5? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is based on the number of times the majority element in each row or column is a certain number. For example, if in the input's rows, the majority of non-zero elements are 2, then output 5 in a certain way.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is a 3x3 grid where each cell (i,j) represents whether there's a path from the left to the right in the input grid for row i*2 (since 5 rows, divided into three parts). For example, row0, row2, row4. If there's a contiguous block of non-zero numbers, then 5. But I'm not sure.\n\nWait, looking at example1's output:\n\n[0,5,0]\n[5,5,5]\n[0,5,0]\n\nThis looks like a cross, where the middle row and middle column are 5s. So maybe in the input, the non-zero elements form a cross. Let's check example1's input:\n\nInput example1:\n\nAll zeros in row0. Then in rows1-4, there are 1s. Let's see:\n\nRow1:0,0,1,1,1 \u2192 1s in columns 2-4\nRow2:0,1,0,1,1 \u2192 columns1,3,4\nRow3:0,1,0,1,0 \u2192 columns1,3\nRow4:0,0,0,0,1 \u2192 column4\n\nSo maybe the non-zero elements form a cross in columns 2 and 3, but rows 1-3. Not sure. The output's cross is middle row and column. Maybe the output's cross is where the input's columns and rows have the most non-zeros.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the number of times a certain number appears in each quadrant. For example, dividing the input into quadrants. But the input is 5x5, which makes it a bit odd.\n\nAlternatively, think about the output as a 3x3 grid where each cell represents a 2x2 block in the input. For example, the first cell of the output corresponds to the input's top-left 2x2 block, then the next to the top-middle, etc. Then, maybe each output cell is 5 if all elements in that block are non-zero, but that's not the case in the examples. Alternatively, if the sum of the block is a certain value.\n\nAlternatively, looking at example0's output, the first row is all 5s. Let's see if the sum of each row in the input has a certain pattern. Input example0's row sums:\n\nRow0:2 \u2192 sum 2\nRow1:0+2+0+0+2=4\nRow2:2+0+0+2+0=4\nRow3:0+0+0+2+2=4\nRow4:0+0+2+2+0=4\n\nBut the output's first row is all 5s, which doesn't match these sums. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is the sum of the diagonals in each 3x3 section of the input. For example, each output cell is the sum of the main diagonal of the corresponding 3x3 input region. For example0's first region (rows0-2, cols0-2):\n\nDiagonal elements: 2 (row0, col0), 2 (row1, col1), 0 (row2, col2). Sum is 4. But output cell is 5. Doesn't fit.\n\nWait, but 5 is a recurring number. Maybe 5 is used to indicate a certain count, like 3 or more. Let's check example0's output. The first row has all 5s. Maybe each output cell represents whether the corresponding input region has at least three 2s. Let's check the first region of example0: rows0-2, cols0-2. How many 2s are there?\n\nRow0:2,0,0 \u2192 1\nRow1:0,2,0 \u21921\nRow2:2,0,0 \u21921\nTotal 3. So if 3 or more, output 5. Then example0's first region would have 3 2s, so 5. Then the output's first row is all 5s, which would mean that each of the three regions in the first row of the output (i.e., the three regions covering rows0-2, cols0-2; cols1-3; cols2-4) each have >=3 2s.\n\nWait, let's check example0's first row of output (all 5s). The three regions would be:\n\nRegion 0: rows0-2, cols0-2 \u2192 3 2s (as before) \u2192 5\nRegion 1: rows0-2, cols1-3 \u2192 how many 2s?\nRow0:0,0,0 \u21920\nRow1:2,0,0 \u21921\nRow2:0,0,2 \u21921\nTotal: 2 \u2192 if the threshold is 3, then no. But the output is 5 here.\n\nHmm, that doesn't fit. So maybe that's not the pattern.\n\nAnother idea: the output is generated by checking for the presence of a certain number along the three main diagonals of the input. For example, the main diagonal, the diagonal above, and below. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is determined by the number of times a certain number appears in the input's spiral order. But that seems complicated.\n\nWait, looking back at example1's input and output:\n\nInput has a lot of 1s. The output is a cross (middle row and column 5s). Maybe in the input, the 1s form a cross. Let's see example1's input:\n\nRow1: columns 2-4 are 1s \u2192 middle column is 2-4, but columns 2-4 are right side. Row2 has 1s at columns1,3,4. Row3 has 1s at columns1 and3. Row4 has a 1 at column4. So perhaps the cross isn't obvious. But the output's cross is middle row and column. Maybe the middle column and middle row of the output correspond to the middle row and column of the input. For example, in the input's middle row (row2), there's a 0 at column2, but other 1s. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is a 3x3 grid where each cell (i,j) is 5 if the sum of the input's row i*2 and column j*2 is a certain value. For example, the output's (0,0) corresponds to input's (0,0). But how?\n\nAnother approach: compare the training examples to see what they have in common.\n\nExample0 and example5 both have outputs where the top row is all 5s and the middle column is 5s. Let's look at their inputs. Example0's input has a lot of 2s spread out. Example5's input also has 2s in certain positions.\n\nWait, maybe the output's pattern is determined by the positions of the majority of the non-zero elements. For example, in example0, the 2s are mostly in the top and middle columns. The output has the top row and middle column as 5s. So perhaps the output's rows and columns where the majority of non-zeros are present are marked with 5s.\n\nBut example1's output has the middle row and column as 5s. Let's see example1's input. The 1s are present in columns2-4 and rows1-3. Maybe the middle row and column of the output correspond to the majority positions in the input.\n\nAlternatively, the output's 3x3 grid is a transformation of the input's 5x5 grid, where each cell in the output is 5 if the corresponding row and column in the input have at least two non-zero elements.\n\nFor example, output cell (0,0) is 5 if row0 and column0 of the input have at least two non-zeros. Let's test this with example0:\n\nRow0 of example0's input has one non-zero (2). Column0 has three 2s. But row0 has only one. So this doesn't fit. So maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, output cell (i,j) is 5 if the number of non-zero elements in row i*2 and column j*2 of the input is a certain number. For example, i*2 because 0, 2, 4 for the rows, j*2 for the columns. Let's see:\n\nFor example0's output cell (0,0), checking row0 (0*2=0) and column0 (0*2=0) of input. Row0 has one 2, column0 has three 2s. If the condition is sum of row and column non-zeros >=5, maybe. 1 (row0) +3 (column0) =4 <5. So no. But example0's output cell (0,0) is 5. So that's not matching.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Let's think of another angle. The output is always 3x3 with 5s and 0s. Maybe the 5s form a shape that corresponds to the shape of the non-zero elements in the input.\n\nFor example, in example0, the output has a horizontal line at the top and a vertical line in the middle. So maybe the input's non-zero elements form a T-shape. Let's check example0's input. The 2s are spread out, but perhaps the top row and middle column of the input have more 2s. The top row (row0) has one 2. Middle column (column2) has zero 2s. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output's 3x3 grid is a downscaled version of the input, where each 5x5 cell is averaged or summed in some way. For example, each output cell is the sum of a 2x2 area in the input, but scaled. For example, 5x5 to 3x3 requires a kernel. Let's see example0's first output cell (0,0) would be sum of input's (0,0), (0,1), (1,0), (1,1). That is:\n\n2+0+0+2=4. But output is 5. Not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output cell is 5 if the corresponding 2x2 block in the input has a certain number of non-zeros. For example, if there are >=2 non-zeros, then 5. Let's check example0's first 2x2 block:\n\n[2,0]\n[0,2] \u2192 two non-zeros. So output cell (0,0) would be 5. Which matches example0's first cell. Then check the next block (columns1-2, rows0-1):\n\n[0,0]\n[2,0] \u2192 one non-zero. Output cell (0,1) would be 0. But example0's output first row is all 5s, which suggests that this approach is incorrect.\n\nHmm. I'm stuck. Let's try to find another approach. Let's look at the test input and see if I can find any pattern.\n\nTest input:\n\nRow0: [1,1,1,1,0]\nRow1: [0,0,1,0,1]\nRow2: [0,1,0,0,0]\nRow3: [0,1,0,0,1]\nRow4: [0,0,1,0,0]\n\nLooking at where the 1s are:\n\nRow0: columns0-3 (four 1s)\nRow1: columns2 and4 (two)\nRow2: column1 (one)\nRow3: columns1 and4 (two)\nRow4: column2 (one)\n\nSo the 1s are mostly in the first few columns (0-3) in row0, then scattered.\n\nLooking at the training examples, the outputs often have a horizontal line or a vertical line. For example, example0's output has a horizontal line on top and vertical in middle. Example1's output has a horizontal line in the middle and vertical in the middle. Example2's output has a horizontal line at the bottom. Example3's output is same as example1. Example4 and 5 have similar outputs to example0.\n\nMaybe the output depends on the row with the maximum number of non-zero elements. For example, in example0's input, the first three rows have 1,3,2 2s. So the maximum is row1 (3). But output's first row is all 5s. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the output's rows correspond to the input's rows with the most non-zero elements. For example, if the input has the most non-zeros in row1, then output's middle row is all 5s. Let's check example1's input:\n\nRow0: all zeros\nRow1: three 1s\nRow2: three 1s\nRow3: two 1s\nRow4: one 1\n\nSo the maximum is rows1 and2 with three 1s. Output has middle row as all 5s. Maybe the output's middle row corresponds to the input's middle row (row2). But in example1, rows1 and2 have the same count. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, the output's horizontal line (all 5s in a row) corresponds to the input's row with the maximum count. For example, in example0, the row with the most 2s is row1 (3 2s), but output's top row is all 5s. So maybe not.\n\nAnother idea: the output is the sum of each quadrant. For example, the input is divided into 3 parts vertically and 3 parts horizontally, leading to 9 regions. Each output cell is the sum of the corresponding region. But the input is 5x5, so dividing into 3 parts may not be even. For example, columns0-1, 2, 3-4. Rows0-1, 2, 3-4. Let's try this for example0.\n\nExample0's input:\n\nRows0-1 (first two rows):\n\nRow0: [2,0,0,0,0]\nRow1: [0,2,0,0,2]\n\nColumns0-1: sum is 2 (row0,0) +0 (row0,1) +0 (row1,0) +2 (row1,1) = 2+2=4\nColumn2: 0+0=0\nColumns3-4: 0+0 +0+2=2\n\nRows2 (middle row):\n\nRow2: [2,0,0,2,0]\n\nColumns0-1:2+0=2\nColumn2:0\nColumns3-4:2+0=2\n\nRows3-4 (last two rows):\n\nRow3: [0,0,0,2,2]\nRow4: [0,0,2,2,0]\n\nColumns0-1:0+0=0\nColumn2:0+2=2\nColumns3-4:2+2 +2+0=4\n\nSo the output would be:\n\nFirst row (rows0-1):\n\n[4,0,2]\n\nMiddle row (row2):\n\n[2,0,2]\n\nLast row (rows3-4):\n\n[0,2,4]\n\nBut example0's output is:\n\n[5,5,5]\n[0,5,0]\n[0,5,0]\n\nThis doesn't match. But maybe if the sum is converted to 5 if it's above a certain threshold, say 3. Then example0's first row's sum would be 4, 0, 2. Only 4 would be 5, others 0. But output's first row is all 5s. So that's not it.\n\nAnother approach: perhaps the output is the result of some kind of maze-solving or pathfinding through the input's non-zero elements. For example, if there's a path from the top to the bottom using non-zero elements, then the output's middle column is 5s. But this seems too vague.\n\nWait, looking at example0's output:\n\nThe top row is all 5s, which might mean that there's a horizontal line of non-zero elements in the input's top three rows. But example0's input's first three rows don't form a horizontal line. Alternatively, the output's first row corresponds to the input's first row being non-zero in certain positions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is determined by the presence of certain numbers in the corners and center of the input. For example, if the four corners and center have a certain value, then output 5s in certain positions. But example0's input's corners are 2 (top-left), 0 (top-right), 0 (bottom-left), 0 (bottom-right). The center (2,2) is 0. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is a 3x3 grid where each cell is 5 if the corresponding row in the input has a non-zero element in that column. For example, output row0 corresponds to input row0, and each cell in output row0 is 5 if input row0 has a non-zero in that column. But example0's input row0 has a 2 in column0, but the output row0 has all 5s. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, the output's columns correspond to the input's columns. For example, output column0 is 5 if the input's column0 has a certain property, like the sum. Example0's column0 has sum 2+0+2+0+0=4. Maybe 4 is converted to 5. But example0's output column0 is [5,0,0]. Not sure.\n\nHmm. Maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's look for a different pattern. Let's check the number of non-zero elements in each example's input and see if it relates to the number of 5s in the output.\n\nExample0's input has 8 twos. Output has 7 5s.\n\nExample1's input has 8 ones. Output has 5 5s.\n\nExample2's input has 8 threes. Output has 5 5s.\n\nExample3's input has 8 ones. Output has 5 5s.\n\nExample4's input has 11 twos. Output has 5 5s.\n\nExample5's input has 9 twos. Output has 5 5s.\n\nExample6's input has 7 threes. Output has 5 5s.\n\nHmm, not sure. The number of 5s in the output isn't directly proportional to the input's non-zero count.\n\nAlternative approach: perhaps the output is a 3x3 grid where each cell represents whether a certain row and column in the input have a non-zero element. For example, output cell (i,j) is 5 if there's a non-zero in input row i and column j. But the input is 5x5, so maybe combining rows and columns in pairs. For example, output row0 corresponds to input rows0-1, output row1 to input row2, and output row2 to input rows3-4. Similarly for columns.\n\nLet's try this with example0's input.\n\nOutput row0 corresponds to input rows0-1. For output cell (0,0), check if there's a non-zero in rows0-1 and columns0-1. For example, columns0-1 in rows0-1:\n\nRow0:2,0\nRow1:0,2\n\nThere are non-zeros here. So output cell (0,0) would be 5. Similarly, columns1-2 in rows0-1: 0,0 and 2,0. So non-zero in row1, column1 \u2192 output cell (0,1) would be 5. And columns2-3 in rows0-1: 0,0 and 0,0 \u2192 no. Wait, but example0's output row0 is all 5s. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, output cell (i,j) is 5 if any of the input's cells in a certain position relative to i and j are non-zero. For example, if i is 0, then check rows0 and1; j is 0, check columns0 and1. If any cell in that 2x2 block is non-zero, output 5. For example0's cell (0,0):\n\nRows0-1, cols0-1: cells (0,0)=2, (0,1)=0, (1,0)=0, (1,1)=2 \u2192 two non-zeros \u2192 5. So output cell (0,0) is 5. Similarly, cell (0,1) would check cols2-3 and rows0-1. For example0, cols2-3 in rows0-1 are all zeros \u2192 no. But example0's output cell (0,1) is 5. So this doesn't work.\n\nI'm stuck. Let's try to look for a different pattern. Maybe the output is a 3x3 grid where each cell is 5 if the sum of the input's row i and column j is even. But that's probably not it.\n\nAnother idea: looking at the examples, the output seems to form a kind of arrow or directional pattern. For example, example0's output is like an arrow pointing up with a vertical line. Example2's output points to the bottom-right. Maybe the direction is determined by the position of the majority of non-zero elements.\n\nIn the test input, the 1s are concentrated in row0 (four 1s), and then scattered in other rows. So maybe the output's top row is all 5s, and middle column is 5s. But looking at the training examples, when the majority is in the top, like example0 and example4, the output's top row is all 5s and the middle column. But example5's input has 2s spread out, and the output is similar to example0.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output's pattern is determined by the number of non-zero elements in each third of the input. For example, the input is divided into three vertical sections (left, middle, right) and three horizontal sections (top, middle, bottom). Each output cell represents the count of non-zeros in that section. But how?\n\nFor example, example0's left section (cols0-1) has 3 twos, middle (col2) has 1 two, right (cols3-4) has 5 twos. If the output is:\n\n[5,5,5]\n[0,5,0]\n[0,5,0]\n\nThis would suggest that the top row (top sections) and middle column have high counts. But example0's top sections would be top third (rows0-1) with left section 3, middle 0, right 2. So sum 3,0,2. But output's top row is all 5s, which would require all sections to be above a threshold. Maybe not.\n\nAnother observation: the outputs have either 5s in a horizontal row or a vertical column. For example, example0 has top row and middle column, which forms a kind of T-shape. Example2 has the bottom row as 5s, which is a horizontal line. Example1 has a cross. So maybe the output indicates the direction where the majority of non-zero elements are aligned in the input.\n\nIn the test input, the majority of 1s are in row0, so maybe the output's top row is all 5s, and the middle column is 5s. Let's see. If the output is similar to example0's, then the answer would be:\n\n[5,5,5]\n[0,5,0]\n[0,5,0]\n\nBut looking at the test input's columns:\n\nColumn0: 1,0,0,0,0 \u2192 sum1\nColumn1:1,0,1,1,0 \u2192 sum3\nColumn2:1,1,0,0,1 \u2192 sum3\nColumn3:1,0,0,0,0 \u2192 sum1\nColumn4:0,1,0,1,0 \u2192 sum2\n\nColumns1 and2 have higher sums. So maybe the middle columns of the output are 5s. So the output would have a vertical line in the middle column and a horizontal line in the top row.\n\nLooking at the test input's rows:\n\nRow0 has four 1s (columns0-3)\nRow1 has two 1s (columns2 and4)\nRow2 has one 1 (column1)\nRow3 has two 1s (columns1 and4)\nRow4 has one 1 (column2)\n\nThe highest concentration is in row0. So perhaps the output's top row is all 5s. The columns with the highest sums are 1 and 2. So maybe the middle column (column1) and column2 are 5s. But how does this translate to the output?\n\nAlternatively, the output's columns are determined by the input's columns with the highest sums. The test input's columns1 and2 have sum3 each. Maybe these correspond to the middle columns of the output. So the output's middle column would be 5s. And the row with the highest sum is row0, so the output's top row is all 5s. So combining these, the output would have a top row of 5s and a middle column of 5s, like example0's output.\n\nThus, the test input's output would be:\n\n[5,5,5]\n[0,5,0]\n[0,5,0]\n\nBut let's check if this matches any training examples. Example0 and example4 have similar outputs. Example1 has a cross. The test input's pattern of row0 being the most dense with 1s and columns1 and2 having the highest sums might lead to the output where top row is all 5s and middle column is 5s.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is determined by the rows and columns with the maximum sum. For example, the output's rows are 5s where the input's row sums are highest, and columns where the input's column sums are highest.\n\nTest input's row sums:\n\nRow0:4\nRow1:2\nRow2:1\nRow3:2\nRow4:1\n\nMaximum row sum is 4 (row0). So output's row0 would be all 5s.\n\nColumn sums:\n\nColumn0:1\nColumn1:3\nColumn2:3\nColumn3:1\nColumn4:2\n\nMaximum column sums are 3 in columns1 and2. So output's columns1 and2 would be 5s.\n\nBut the output is 3x3, so columns0-2 in the output correspond to the original columns0-4. Wait, no. How to map the 5 columns to 3 output columns.\n\nMaybe the output's columns are grouped. For example, columns0-1, column2, columns3-4. Then, the output's column0 corresponds to input's columns0-1 sum, column1 to column2, and column2 to columns3-4 sum.\n\nIn the test input:\n\nColumns0-1 sum:1 (col0) +3 (col1) =4\nColumn2 sum:3\nColumns3-4 sum:1 (col3) +2 (col4) =3\n\nSo output's columns would be:\n\nColumn0:4\nColumn1:3\nColumn2:3\n\nIf the output's columns are 5 where the sum is highest. Highest is 4 and 3. 4 is higher than 3. So output's column0 would have 5s. But the maximum row sum is row0 (4), so output's row0 is all 5s. Combining row0 and column0, the output's row0, column0 would be 5. But how does that form the output matrix?\n\nThis is getting too vague. Given time constraints, I'll make an educated guess based on the examples. The test input's highest row is row0 (four 1s), and highest columns are 1 and 2 (sum3 each). So maybe the output's top row is all 5s, and the middle columns are 5s, forming a T-shape. So the output would be:\n\n[5,5,5]\n[0,5,0]\n[0,5,0]\n\nLooking at the training examples, this pattern occurs in example0, example4, example5, etc. So I'll go with this.",

        "cot_2": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. So, the task is to take a 5x5 grid of numbers as input and transform it into a 3x3 grid output where some elements are 5 and others are 0. Let me look through the examples to see if I can spot the rule.\n\nStarting with Example 0. The input is a 5x5 grid with 2s and 0s. The output is three rows: [5,5,5], [0,5,0], [0,5,0]. Hmm. Maybe the output is based on the positions of the non-zero elements in the input. Let's see. The output has a 5 in the center and the top row all 5s. Wait, maybe it's related to how the numbers are arranged in the input columns or rows.\n\nLooking at Example 0's input:\n\nRow 0: [2,0,0,0,0]\nRow 1: [0,2,0,0,2]\nRow 2: [2,0,0,2,0]\nRow 3: [0,0,0,2,2]\nRow 4: [0,0,2,2,0]\n\nLooking at columns. Each column in the input might be summed or checked for certain properties. Let's see the output's first row is all 5s. The output is 3x3, so maybe each cell in the output corresponds to a 3x3 area in the input. Wait, but the input is 5x5. Maybe it's divided into overlapping 3x3 regions? Or perhaps there's another way.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is a count of the number of times a certain value appears in specific positions. For instance, in Example 0, the output's top row is all 5s. Let me check if the first three columns of the input's rows have 2s in certain positions. Not sure yet.\n\nWait, let's consider another example. Example 1's input has 0s and 1s. The output is [0,5,0], [5,5,5], [0,5,0]. So the middle row is all 5s, and the first and third rows have 5 in the middle. That looks like a cross shape. Maybe the output is a cross where the middle row and column are 5s. But how does that relate to the input?\n\nWait, maybe the output is the count of how many times a certain number appears in each row and column of the input. Let me check Example 0. The input has 2s. The output's middle column is all 5s. Wait, perhaps the output is determined by the positions where the non-zero elements in the input form a certain pattern.\n\nAlternatively, think about each output cell corresponding to a position in the input grid. Since the output is 3x3, maybe the input is divided into a 3x3 grid by some method. For example, each output cell is determined by the 5x5 input's regions. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is a representation of the number of times a particular number (like 2, 3, 1) appears in each row or column of the input. Let's check Example 0. The input has 2s. Let's count how many 2s in each row:\n\nRow 0: 1\nRow 1: 2\nRow 2: 2\nRow 3: 2\nRow 4: 2 (since 2 appears in positions 2 and 3, so two times?)\n\nWait, row 4 of Example 0 is [0,0,2,2,0], so that's two 2s. So total 1+2+2+2+2=9 2s? Not sure how that relates to the output.\n\nLooking at Example 1's input, which has 1s. The output has a cross. Maybe the output is a cross if the majority of the non-zero elements form a cross in the input. Let's see Example 1's input:\n\nRow 0: all 0s.\n\nRow 1: [0,0,1,1,1] \u2192 three 1s in the last three columns.\n\nRow 2: [0,1,0,1,1] \u2192 three 1s.\n\nRow 3: [0,1,0,1,0] \u2192 two 1s.\n\nRow 4: [0,0,0,0,1] \u2192 one 1.\n\nSo maybe the pattern in the input is that the 1s are forming a vertical line in the middle columns? Not exactly. But the output is a cross. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output's 5s correspond to the positions where in the input there's a certain number of non-zero elements in the surrounding cells. For example, each output cell (i,j) corresponds to a 3x3 area in the input centered at some position.\n\nWait, considering the input is 5x5 and the output is 3x3. Let's think of the 5x5 grid as layers. The output could be the center 3x3, but no. Let's map the output coordinates to input coordinates. For example:\n\nOutput row 0, column 0 \u2192 input row 0, column 0?\n\nBut that would leave the output as the top-left 3x3 of the input, but looking at Example 0's input:\n\nOriginal input rows 0-4. The output rows are [5,5,5], [0,5,0], [0,5,0]. If that's the center 3 rows and columns, then input rows 1-3 and columns 1-3. Let's check:\n\nInput row 1: [0,2,0,0,2] \u2192 columns 1-3 are [2,0,0], which would be 2,0,0. Row 2: [2,0,0,2,0] \u2192 columns 1-3 [0,0,2]. Row 3: [0,0,0,2,2] \u2192 columns 1-3 [0,0,2]. So the center 3x3 of the input is:\n\nRow 1: 2,0,0\n\nRow 2:0,0,2\n\nRow3:0,0,2\n\nBut the output is different. So that's probably not the case.\n\nAlternative approach: Let's see the output for each example. In Example 0, the output has 5s in the top row and middle column. Example 1's output is a cross. Example 2's output is a bottom row full of 5s and the first two rows have 5s in the third column. Example 3's output is a cross again. Example 4's output is the same as Example 0. Example 5's output is the same as Example 0. Example 6's output is similar to Example 2.\n\nLooking for patterns: The outputs seem to form shapes. Cross (like Example1,3) or horizontal lines (Example0,4,5), or vertical lines (Example2,6). Wait, in Example2 and 6, the output has a vertical line on the rightmost column and the bottom row full of 5s. Hmm.\n\nPerhaps the output depends on the positions where the non-zero elements in the input form a certain structure. For example, if the non-zero elements form a vertical line in the input, the output is a vertical line. If they form a horizontal line, the output is a horizontal line. If they form a cross, the output is a cross.\n\nBut how to map the input's structure to the output's shape. Let's look at the inputs.\n\nTake Example 0's input. Let's see where the non-zero (2s) are:\n\nRow0: column0.\n\nRow1: columns1 and4.\n\nRow2: columns0 and3.\n\nRow3: columns3 and4.\n\nRow4: columns2 and3.\n\nPlotting these positions, it's not immediately obvious. Maybe the sum of each row and column?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is based on the count of non-zero elements in each diagonal, row, or column.\n\nWait, let's count for each example:\n\nExample0 input: 2s.\n\nRow counts (number of 2s per row):\n\nRow0:1, Row1:2, Row2:2, Row3:2, Row4:2.\n\nColumn counts:\n\nColumn0: 2 (rows0 and2)\n\nColumn1:1 (row1)\n\nColumn2:2 (row4 and maybe others?)\n\nWait, column2 in input Example0:\n\nRow0:0\n\nRow1:0\n\nRow2:0\n\nRow3:0\n\nRow4:2 \u2192 only 1. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is determined by the positions where the majority of the non-zero elements are in certain quadrants of the input.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output's 3x3 grid represents the number of times a particular cell in the input's 5x5 grid is surrounded by non-zero elements. But that seems complicated.\n\nWait, looking at Example1's output: cross shape. The input's non-zero elements (1s) are mostly in the middle columns. For example, rows1-4 have 1s in columns2-4, but maybe not. Let me check:\n\nIn Example1's input:\n\nRow1: columns2,3,4 have 1s.\n\nRow2: columns1,3,4.\n\nRow3: columns1,3.\n\nRow4: column4.\n\nSo perhaps the 1s are concentrated in the middle and right part. But how does that translate to a cross in the output?\n\nAnother approach: Look for the position of the number 5 in the output and see if there's a relation to the input's non-zero elements.\n\nIn Example0's output:\n\nTop row: all 5s.\n\nMiddle row: 0,5,0.\n\nBottom row:0,5,0.\n\nSo the output has a horizontal line on top and a vertical line in the middle.\n\nLooking at the input's non-zero elements, maybe the top row of the output corresponds to the presence of non-zero elements in the top part of the input. For instance, maybe the output's first row is 5s if the input has non-zero elements in the first two rows. But in Example0, the first row has a non-zero (2), and rows1 and 2 have non-zero elements. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each cell in the output corresponds to a 3x3 area in the input. Let's think of the 5x5 input as overlapping 3x3 grids. For example, the output cell (0,0) could be based on the input's top-left 3x3 grid. But the output is 3x3, which would require the input to be divided into 3x3 regions with some overlap. Let's see:\n\nThe input's 5x5 grid can have 3x3 regions starting at (0,0), (0,1), (0,2), (1,0), etc. But that would give 3x3 outputs. But the examples have 3x3 outputs. Wait, maybe each output cell corresponds to a 3x3 section in the input. For example:\n\nThe output's 3x3 grid is formed by checking each possible 3x3 subgrid in the input (there are 3x3 possible positions) and seeing if they meet a certain condition. But how?\n\nAlternatively, the output is created by taking the sum of the non-zero elements in certain regions. For example, each output cell is 5 if the corresponding region in the input has a sum equal to a certain value. Let's check Example0's output first row all 5s. The top regions could be the top three rows. For instance, the first output row may look at the first three rows of the input. Let's calculate the sum of non-zero elements in the first three rows of Example0:\n\nRows0-2: \n\nRow0 has 2 (sum 2).\n\nRow1 has two 2s (sum 4).\n\nRow2 has two 2s (sum4).\n\nTotal sum for first three rows: 2+4+4=10. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the output rows correspond to the input's rows, but compressed. For example, each output row is the sum of the input's two adjacent rows. But that's not matching the examples.\n\nAlternatively, think of the output as a heatmap where 5s indicate high concentration of non-zero elements. For instance, in Example0, the top row of the output is all 5s, so maybe the top part of the input has more non-zero elements. Let's check Example0's input. The non-zero elements are spread across rows0-4, but perhaps in certain columns.\n\nAnother thought: the output's rows and columns might be related to the majority of non-zero elements in the input's columns or rows. For example, if the majority of non-zero elements in the input's columns are in the left side, the output's left column is 5s. But not sure.\n\nLooking at Example2's input:\n\n[3,0,0,0,0]\n\n[0,0,0,3,3]\n\n[0,3,3,0,0]\n\n[0,3,0,3,0]\n\n[3,0,3,3,0]\n\nOutput is:\n\n[0,0,5]\n\n[0,0,5]\n\n[5,5,5]\n\nSo the third column (rightmost) and the bottom row are 5s. The input's non-zero elements are 3s. Let's see where the 3s are:\n\nRow0: column0.\n\nRow1: columns3,4.\n\nRow2: columns1,2.\n\nRow3: columns1,3.\n\nRow4: columns0,2,3.\n\nSo the rightmost columns (3 and4) have 3s in rows1,3,4. So maybe the output's right column is 5s because the input has a lot of 3s in columns3 and4.\n\nBut in the output, the third column (index 2) is all 5s in the first two rows and the bottom row. So that's three 5s. The bottom row has all 5s. So maybe if the input's bottom row has non-zero elements, the output's bottom row is all 5s. Let's check:\n\nIn Example2's input, the bottom row (row4) has 3s in columns0,2,3. So the output's bottom row is all 5s. Similarly, in Example6's input, the bottom row (row4) is [3,3,3,0,0], so three 3s. The output's bottom row is all 5s.\n\nIn Example0's input, the bottom row (row4) has two 2s. The output's bottom row is [0,5,0]. Hmm. That doesn't fit. So maybe that's not the pattern.\n\nAlternatively, the output's bottom row is all 5s if the input has non-zero elements in the last row. But Example0's last row has two 2s, and the output's bottom row is [0,5,0]. So that's not it.\n\nWait, maybe the output's structure is determined by the positions of the majority of non-zero elements. For example, if the non-zero elements are mostly in the right columns of the input, the output's right column is 5s. Let's check Example2. The input's 3s are in columns0,1,2,3,4, but in rows1-4, columns3 and4 have more 3s. So the output's right column (third column) is all 5s. Similarly, in Example6's input, the 3s are in columns0,1,2 in the first few rows, but the output's right column has 5s. Hmm, maybe not directly.\n\nAlternative approach: Let's look at how the output shape relates to the input's non-zero positions.\n\nExample0's output: top row all 5s, middle column all 5s.\n\nLooking at the input's non-zero elements (2s):\n\nRow0: column0.\n\nRow1: columns1 and4.\n\nRow2: columns0 and3.\n\nRow3: columns3 and4.\n\nRow4: columns2 and3.\n\nIf I imagine connecting these positions, they form a sort of 'T' shape. The top row (row0) has a single 2 on the left, row1 has two 2s, etc. Maybe the output's top row is 5s because the input's top rows have non-zero elements spread across the columns. Not sure.\n\nAnother angle: the output's 3x3 grid might represent the count of non-zero elements in certain trios of rows and columns. For example, output cell (0,0) could be the sum of input's rows 0 and 1, columns 0 and 1. But not sure.\n\nWait, let's think of the output as a 3x3 grid where each cell represents the sum of non-zero elements in a certain region of the input. For example:\n\nThe output is divided into 3 rows and 3 columns. Each output row corresponds to two adjacent rows in the input (since 5 input rows would be split into 3 output rows: rows0-1, 1-2, 2-3, 3-4?), but 3 output rows. Similarly for columns.\n\nFor instance, output row0 is the combination of input rows0 and 1. Output row1 is input rows2. Output row2 is input rows3 and4. But this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, output row0 corresponds to input rows0-2, row1 to rows1-3, row2 to rows2-4. Similarly for columns. Then, for each of these 3x3 regions, we check if there's a certain pattern.\n\nFor example, if in a 3x3 region of the input (rows i- i+2, columns j-j+2) there's a certain number of non-zero elements, then the output cell is 5.\n\nBut how would that work for the examples.\n\nTake Example0's input. The output's first row is all 5s. Let's see the input's top 3 rows (rows0-2) and all possible 3-column sections:\n\nFor output cell (0,0), which would correspond to input rows0-2 and columns0-2. Let's see:\n\nRow0: [2,0,0]\n\nRow1: [0,2,0]\n\nRow2: [2,0,0]\n\nSum of non-zero elements here: 2 +2 +2 =6. Not sure if that's relevant.\n\nBut the output cell (0,0) is 5, which may not relate to 6. Alternatively, maybe it's the count of non-zero elements. In this 3x3 section (rows0-2, cols0-2):\n\nNumber of non-zero elements: 2 (row0, col0), 2 (row1, col1), 2 (row2, col0) \u2192 total 3 non-zero elements. So output is 5 if there are 3 non-zero? But in Example0's output, all three cells in the first row are 5. Let's check another section for output cell (0,1). That would correspond to input rows0-2, columns1-3:\n\nRow0: [0,0,0]\n\nRow1: [2,0,0]\n\nRow2: [0,0,2]\n\nNon-zero count: 2 (row1, col1) and 2 (row2, col3) \u2192 2 non-zero. But output cell (0,1) is 5. So that doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. Maybe this approach isn't right.\n\nAnother idea: the output's 3x3 grid represents the middle of the input's 5x5 grid. For example, the output's center cell is 5 if there's a non-zero in the input's center (row2, column2). Let's check.\n\nExample0's input center is row2, column2: 0. So output's center is 5. But in Example0's output, the center cell (1,1) is 5. So that's not matching. Because input's center is 0. So that can't be.\n\nAlternative approach: Looking at the output's structure:\n\n- Some examples have a horizontal line (top row all 5s, others have 5 in the middle).\n- Some have a vertical line (like Example2's third column).\n- Some have a cross.\n\nThe key might be to determine what pattern in the input leads to which output structure.\n\nLooking at Example0 and Example5, which have the same output structure (horizontal line and vertical line). Their input non-zero elements are spread across various columns but maybe form a certain shape.\n\nWait, in Example0's input, the non-zero elements are at positions:\n\nRow0:0\n\nRow1:1,4\n\nRow2:0,3\n\nRow3:3,4\n\nRow4:2,3.\n\nIf we connect these dots, maybe they form a 'T' shape. But how?\n\nAlternatively, the output might be determined by the positions where the non-zero elements form a certain shape when mirrored or rotated.\n\nAnother observation: In all examples, the output consists of 5s and 0s. The number 5 might represent a certain condition being met. The number in the input (2,1,3, etc.) doesn't seem to affect the output's value, just whether it's non-zero. So the actual value in the input (like 2, 3, 1) doesn't matter; only that it's non-zero.\n\nSo, the transformation is based on the positions of the non-zero elements, not their values.\n\nNow, let's re-examine the examples with this in mind.\n\nExample0: Input has non-zero elements in positions:\n\nRow0:0\n\nRow1:1,4\n\nRow2:0,3\n\nRow3:3,4\n\nRow4:2,3.\n\nThe output is:\n\n[5,5,5]\n\n[0,5,0]\n\n[0,5,0]\n\nSo the top row is all 5s, and the middle column is all 5s. This forms a 'T' shape.\n\nExample1's output is a cross. The input's non-zero elements (1s) are:\n\nRow1:2,3,4\n\nRow2:1,3,4\n\nRow3:1,3\n\nRow4:4.\n\nSo maybe these positions form a cross in the input. But how?\n\nAnother idea: The output's 3x3 grid corresponds to the presence of non-zero elements in specific positions of the input. For example, each output cell is 5 if there's a non-zero in the corresponding diagonal or row of the input.\n\nAlternatively, the output's rows and columns might be related to the parity of the sum of certain rows or columns in the input.\n\nAlternatively, the output is determined by how many times a certain column or row has non-zero elements. For example, if the majority of non-zero elements are in the top rows, the output's top row is 5s.\n\nAlternatively, the output represents the maximum non-zero count in each row or column. For example, if a row in the input has the highest number of non-zero elements, the corresponding output row is all 5s. But looking at Example0's input:\n\nRow0:1 non-zero\n\nRow1:2\n\nRow2:2\n\nRow3:2\n\nRow4:2\n\nThe top row has the least, but the output's top row is all 5s. So that's not matching.\n\nAnother thought: The output's 3x3 grid could be the result of applying a convolution or filter to the input. For example, a 3x3 kernel that checks for specific patterns. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the output's each cell corresponds to a diagonal in the input. For example:\n\nOutput cell (0,0) corresponds to the main diagonal of the input (0,0; 1,1; 2,2; 3,3;4,4). If that diagonal has at least one non-zero, then 5. Let's check Example0's main diagonal:\n\nInput rows 0-4, columns 0-4:\n\nRow0:2\n\nRow1:2\n\nRow2:0 (since row2, column2 is 0)\n\nRow3:2 (row3, column3 is 2)\n\nRow4:0 (row4, column4 is 0)\n\nSo the main diagonal has non-zero in rows0,1,3. But the output's (0,0) is 5. So maybe if any non-zero in the main diagonal, then 5. But output cell (0,0) is 5, but row0's main diagonal is 2. So perhaps yes. But Example0's output cell (0,0) is 5, but cell (0,1) and (0,2) are also 5. So this theory might not hold.\n\nAnother approach: Let's look for a pattern in the output shapes:\n\n- The cross (Examples1,3) has 5s in the middle row and middle column.\n\n- The horizontal line (Examples0,4,5) has 5s in the top row and middle column.\n\n- The vertical line (Examples2,6) has 5s in the right column and bottom row.\n\nMaybe the output shape depends on the direction of the majority of non-zero elements in the input. For example, if non-zero elements are spread horizontally across the top, the output is a horizontal line. If they form a vertical line on the right, the output is a vertical line.\n\nLooking at Example2's input: non-zero elements are mostly in the right columns (3 and4 in row1, etc.), and the output's third column and bottom row are 5s.\n\nExample6's input has non-zero elements in the left and middle columns initially, but the output has third column and bottom row. Hmm, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output's shape is determined by the direction in which the non-zero elements are most densely packed. For example, if they form a horizontal line in the input's top rows, the output's top row is 5s.\n\nBut in Example0's input, the non-zero elements are spread out, but the output's top row is all 5s.\n\nMaybe the output is a representation of the most common column or row where non-zero elements appear. Let's check Example0's input columns:\n\nColumn0: 2 in row0, 0 in row1, 2 in row2, 0 in row3, 0 in row4 \u2192 2 non-zero.\n\nColumn1: 0, 2, 0, 0, 0 \u2192 1 non-zero.\n\nColumn2: 0,0,0,0,2 \u2192 1 non-zero.\n\nColumn3: 0,0,2,2,2 \u2192 3 non-zero.\n\nColumn4: 0,2,0,2,0 \u2192 2 non-zero.\n\nSo column3 has the most non-zero elements (3). So maybe the output's middle column (column1?) is 5s. Wait, but the output's middle column is index1 (assuming 0-based). In Example0's output, the middle column (index1) is all 5s. But column3 of the input has the most non-zeros. So that doesn't align.\n\nAlternatively, the output's columns are the first three columns of the input. But in Example0's input, column3 has the most non-zeros, but the output's third column (index2) is part of the top row which is all 5s. Not sure.\n\nAnother observation: In examples where the output is a cross (Examples1,3), the input's non-zero elements are spread across multiple rows and columns but perhaps form a cross in the input. For example, in Example1's input, the non-zero elements are in columns 2,3,4 and rows1-4. Maybe they form a cross in the input's center.\n\nAlternatively, the output is a cross if the input's non-zero elements form a plus sign in the center of the input.\n\nLooking at Example1's input:\n\nRow1: columns2,3,4 are 1s.\n\nRow2: columns1,3,4 are 1s.\n\nRow3: columns1,3 are 1s.\n\nSo, the center of the input (row2, column2) is 0. But the surrounding areas have 1s. Maybe the output cross is formed because the non-zero elements are around the center in a cross-like fashion.\n\nAlternatively, the output cross represents that the input has a certain number of non-zero elements in the middle row and middle column.\n\nBut in Example1's input, the middle row (row2) has three 1s. The middle column (column2) has two 1s (row1 and row2). So maybe the cross in the output is formed when the middle row and column of the input have non-zero elements. But in Example1's input, row2 (middle) has three 1s, column2 (middle) has two 1s. So the cross in the output could be based on that.\n\nSimilarly, in Example3's output is a cross. Let's check the input's middle row and column.\n\nExample3's input:\n\nRow0: [1,0,1,0,0]\n\nRow1: [1,0,0,1,1]\n\nRow2: [1,1,0,1,0]\n\nRow3: [0,1,0,1,0]\n\nRow4: [1,0,0,0,1]\n\nMiddle row (row2): has 1s in columns0,1,3.\n\nMiddle column (column2): rows0 and2 have 1s (row0:1, row2:0? Wait, row2's column2 is 0. So middle column (column2) has 1s in row0 and row4? No, row0's column2 is 1, row4's column2 is 0.\n\nSo the middle column (column2) has 1s in row0, and others have 0. So maybe that's not the case.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Let me try to find a different approach.\n\nLooking at all examples, the output is always 3x3 with 5s forming a certain shape. Let's list the possible outputs and see if there's a pattern in the input:\n\n- Examples0,4,5: output has a horizontal line on top and vertical line in the middle.\n\n- Examples1,3: cross.\n\n- Examples2,6: vertical line on the right and horizontal line on the bottom.\n\nSo the output shapes are either cross, horizontal+vertical, or vertical+bottom.\n\nLooking at the inputs for each output type:\n\nFor cross (Examples1,3):\n\nExample1's input has non-zero elements (1s) spread across rows1-4, with columns2-4 having more. Example3's input has 1s in various positions.\n\nFor horizontal+vertical (Examples0,4,5):\n\nExample0's input has 2s spread across rows0-4, in various columns. Example4's input has 2s in many positions, perhaps forming a vertical line. Example5's input has 2s in a vertical line.\n\nFor vertical+bottom (Examples2,6):\n\nExample2's input has 3s in the right columns and the bottom row. Example6's input has 3s in the bottom row and some columns.\n\nMaybe the key is to determine which shape the non-zero elements in the input form and then map that to the output shape. For example:\n\n- If the non-zero elements form a cross in the input, the output is a cross.\n\n- If they form a horizontal line and a vertical line, the output is horizontal and vertical.\n\n- If they form a vertical line on the right and a horizontal line at the bottom, the output is vertical and bottom.\n\nBut how to determine this from the input.\n\nAlternatively, the output is determined by the number of non-zero elements in each quadrant of the input. For example, dividing the input into top-left, top-right, bottom-left, bottom-right quadrants. If the majority of non-zero elements are in the top-left, the output has a certain shape.\n\nAlternatively, the output's shape depends on the position of the majority of the non-zero elements:\n\n- If most non-zero are in the top rows, the output has a horizontal line on top.\n\n- If most are in the middle columns, the output has a vertical line.\n\n- If they are spread in the middle rows and columns, the output is a cross.\n\nBut this is vague.\n\nLooking at Example2's input, the non-zero elements are mostly in the right columns (3 and4) and the bottom rows. The output's right column and bottom row are 5s. So maybe the output's shape reflects the regions where the non-zero elements are concentrated.\n\nExample6's input non-zero are in the first two columns and then the bottom row. The output's third column and bottom row are 5s. So perhaps the output's right column corresponds to the input's rightmost columns.\n\nAnother idea: The output is a compressed version of the input's non-zero positions. For example, each output row represents two input rows (since 5 rows to 3 output rows), and each output column represents two input columns. But how?\n\nFor example, output row0 represents input rows0-1, row1 represents row2, row2 represents rows3-4. Similarly for columns. Then, for each output cell, if any of the corresponding input cells are non-zero, the output is 5.\n\nBut let's test this with Example0:\n\nInput rows0-1:\n\nRow0: [2,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow1: [0,2,0,0,2]\n\nColumns0-1 for rows0-1: 2,0 (row0) and 0,2 (row1). So the top-left output cell (0,0) would correspond to any non-zero in input rows0-1, columns0-1. In this case, row0 has 2 in column0, and row1 has 2 in column1. So there are non-zero elements here, so output cell (0,0) is 5. Similarly, output cell (0,1) corresponds to columns2-3 in rows0-1. Are there any non-zero elements? In rows0-1, columns2-3: 0,0 (row0) and 0,0 (row1). So output cell (0,1) would be 0. But in Example0's output, the first row is all 5s, which contradicts this.\n\nHmm. So this approach doesn't fit.\n\nAnother angle: The output is a 3x3 grid where each cell is 5 if the corresponding input row and column (when summed) meet a certain condition. For example, output cell (i,j) is 5 if the sum of input row i and column j is greater than a threshold.\n\nBut let's try for Example0:\n\nOutput cell (0,0) is 5. Let's sum input row0 and column0.\n\nRow0 has sum 2. Column0 has sum 2 (rows0 and2). Total sum 4. Output is 5, so maybe sum >=4.\n\nBut Example1's output cell (0,0) is 0. Row0 sum is 0, column0 sum is 0. So total 0, which would not meet the threshold. This could work. But for Example0's cell (0,0), row0 sum is 2, column0 sum is 2, total 4. If threshold is 4, then yes. But Example0's output cell (0,1) is 5. Row0 sum is 2, column1 sum is 2 (row1 has 2). So total 4, which would be 5. Similarly, cell (0,2) would be row0 sum (2) + column2 sum (2's in row4) \u2192 2+1=3 (if column2 sum is 1). Then total 3, which is less than threshold. But output cell (0,2) is 5. So this approach is invalid.\n\nAnother idea: Maybe each output cell is 5 if the corresponding input row and column have at least one non-zero element. For example, output cell (i,j) is 5 if input row i has a non-zero and column j has a non-zero.\n\nLet's test this with Example0:\n\nOutput cell (0,0): input row0 has a 2 (non-zero), column0 has non-zero (rows0,2). So yes \u2192 5.\n\nOutput cell (0,1): row0 has non-zero (2), column1 has non-zero (row1's 2). Yes \u21925.\n\nOutput cell (0,2): row0 has non-zero, column2 has non-zero (row4's 2). Yes \u21925.\n\nBut the output's first row is all 5s. So this fits.\n\nFor the second row of the output (i=1):\n\nCell (1,0): row1 has non-zero (yes), column0 has non-zero (rows0,2). Yes \u21925. But the output's cell (1,0) is 0. So this theory is incorrect.\n\nHmm. So that doesn't work.\n\nAnother approach: Let's look at the number of non-zero elements in each row and column of the input and see if that correlates to the output.\n\nExample0's input:\n\nRows:\n\nRow0:1\n\nRow1:2\n\nRow2:2\n\nRow3:2\n\nRow4:2\n\nColumns:\n\nColumn0:2\n\nColumn1:1\n\nColumn2:1\n\nColumn3:3\n\nColumn4:2\n\nSo column3 has the highest count. But the output's third column (index2) is part of the top row being all 5s. Not sure.\n\nExample1's input:\n\nRows:\n\nRow0:0\n\nRow1:3\n\nRow2:3\n\nRow3:2\n\nRow4:1\n\nColumns:\n\nColumn0:0\n\nColumn1:2\n\nColumn2:1\n\nColumn3:3\n\nColumn4:3\n\nColumns3 and4 have highest counts. Output is a cross. Not sure.\n\nExample2's input:\n\nRows:\n\nRow0:1\n\nRow1:2\n\nRow2:2\n\nRow3:2\n\nRow4:3\n\nColumns:\n\nColumn0:2\n\nColumn1:2\n\nColumn2:2\n\nColumn3:3\n\nColumn4:1\n\nColumn3 has highest count. Output's third column (index2) is all 5s in first two rows and bottom row.\n\nHmm. Maybe the output's columns are based on the input columns with the highest non-zero counts. For example, if column3 has the highest count, then the output's third column (index2) is filled with 5s. But in Example0, column3 has 3 non-zero, which is the highest, but the output's third column (index2) is 5 only in the first row. So that doesn't fit.\n\nThis is really tricky. Let's try to find another pattern.\n\nLooking at the output shapes and the input's non-zero positions:\n\n- Example0's output has the top row all 5s and middle column 5s. The input's non-zero elements are spread across various columns but are present in rows0-4. Maybe the output is formed by combining the first row of the input and the middle column.\n\nBut why would the top row of the output be all 5s? Let's see Example0's input first row has a non-zero in column0. The output's first row is all 5s. So that's not directly related.\n\nAnother idea: The output's 3x3 grid represents the number of non-zero elements in each of the input's 3x3 corners. For example:\n\nTop-left corner (rows0-1, columns0-1), top-middle (rows0-1, columns1-2), etc. But the output is 3x3, so each cell would correspond to a 2x2 region in the input. But how?\n\nAlternatively, the output is created by dividing the input into a 3x3 grid and checking if each corresponding region contains at least one non-zero. For example, each output cell is 5 if any cell in the corresponding region of the input is non-zero.\n\nBut the input is 5x5. Let's divide it into 3x3 regions. For example:\n\nOutput cell (0,0) corresponds to input rows0-1 and columns0-1.\n\nOutput cell (0,1) corresponds to input rows0-1 and columns2-3.\n\nOutput cell (0,2) corresponds to input rows0-1 and columns4.\n\nOutput cell (1,0) corresponds to input rows2 and columns0-1.\n\nAnd so on. But this would create a 3x3 output where each cell represents a region in the input. Let's test this for Example0.\n\nExample0's input:\n\nRows0-1, columns0-1 (cell (0,0)):\n\nRow0: [2,0]\n\nRow1: [0,2]\n\nNon-zero elements: 2 in row0 and 2 in row1. So output cell (0,0) is 5.\n\nCell (0,1) corresponds to rows0-1, columns2-3:\n\nRow0: [0,0]\n\nRow1: [0,0]\n\nNo non-zero, so output cell (0,1) is 0. But in Example0's output, the first row is all 5s. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternative division: Maybe the input is divided into 3x3 regions with some overlap. For example, each output cell corresponds to a 3x3 region in the input. But since the input is 5x5, there are 3x3 possible regions:\n\nRows0-2, columns0-2 \u2192 cell (0,0)\n\nRows0-2, columns1-3 \u2192 cell (0,1)\n\nRows0-2, columns2-4 \u2192 cell (0,2)\n\nRows1-3, columns0-2 \u2192 cell (1,0)\n\nRows1-3, columns1-3 \u2192 cell (1,1)\n\nRows1-3, columns2-4 \u2192 cell (1,2)\n\nRows2-4, columns0-2 \u2192 cell (2,0)\n\nRows2-4, columns1-3 \u2192 cell (2,1)\n\nRows2-4, columns2-4 \u2192 cell (2,2)\n\nEach output cell is 5 if the corresponding 3x3 region in the input contains a certain pattern.\n\nFor Example0's output cell (0,0), which is 5. The corresponding input region is rows0-2, columns0-2:\n\nRow0: [2,0,0]\n\nRow1: [0,2,0]\n\nRow2: [2,0,0]\n\nThis region has non-zero elements at (0,0), (1,1), (2,0). The pattern here might form a diagonal. But why would that make the output cell 5? Not sure.\n\nExample0's output cell (0,1) is 5. Corresponding region rows0-2, columns1-3:\n\nRow0: [0,0,0]\n\nRow1: [2,0,0]\n\nRow2: [0,0,2]\n\nNon-zero elements at (1,1), (2,3). Hmm, not a clear pattern.\n\nAlternatively, each output cell is 5 if the corresponding 3x3 region in the input has non-zero elements in all four corners. For example, in the region for cell (0,0), the corners are (0,0), (0,2), (2,0), (2,2). If all are non-zero, then 5. But in Example0's cell (0,0) region, (0,0) is 2, (0,2) is 0, (2,0) is 2, (2,2) is 0. So only two non-zero. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAnother possible pattern: Each output cell is 5 if the corresponding 3x3 region in the input has a non-zero in the center. For Example0's cell (0,0) region, center is (1,1) which is 2. So yes, output is 5. Cell (0,1) region's center is (1,2) which is 0. So output would be 0, but in Example0's output, cell (0,1) is 5. So this theory is invalid.\n\nThis is really challenging. Let's try to find a different approach.\n\nLooking at the test input:\n\nTest Input:\n\n[1, 1, 1, 1, 0]\n\n[0, 0, 1, 0, 1]\n\n[0, 1, 0, 0, 0]\n\n[0, 1, 0, 0, 1]\n\n[0, 0, 1, 0, 0]\n\nThe non-zero elements are 1s. Let's plot their positions:\n\nRow0: columns0,1,2,3 (all except 4)\n\nRow1: columns2,4.\n\nRow2: column1.\n\nRow3: columns1,4.\n\nRow4: column2.\n\nSo the non-zero elements are spread across the top row (row0) and in columns1,2,4 in other rows. \n\nIf I compare this to the examples, perhaps the output is a cross. For example, if there are non-zero elements in the middle row and middle column of the input. In the test input, the middle row is row2, which has a 1 in column1. The middle column is column2, which has 1s in row0 and row4. So maybe the output is a cross. But let's check which examples have cross outputs.\n\nExamples1 and3 have cross outputs. Let's see their input characteristics. \n\nExample1's input has non-zero elements in the middle and right columns. Test input's non-zero are spread across left and middle columns. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the test input's non-zero elements in row0 form a horizontal line (four 1s), and other non-zero are scattered. This might lead to the output having a horizontal line in the top row. \n\nLooking at Example0,4,5, which have top row 5s. Their inputs have non-zero elements in the top rows. Example0's row0 has a 2, Example4's row0 has 2, and Example5's row0 has 0. Wait, Example5's input row0 is [0,2,0,2,0], which has two 2s. So top row has non-zero elements. But the output's top row is all 5s. So maybe if the top row has non-zero elements, the output's top row is 5s. But in the test input's top row has four 1s, which could fit this pattern. So the output's top row would be all 5s.\n\nAdditionally, if there's a vertical line in the middle column of the input, the output's middle column would be 5s. The test input's middle column is column2, which has 1s in row0, row1, row4. So possibly, the middle column of the output is all 5s.\n\nCombining these two, the output would be:\n\n[5,5,5]\n\n[0,5,0]\n\n[0,5,0]\n\nWhich is the same as Examples0,4,5. But wait, let's check the input's middle column (column2) non-zero count. Test input's column2 has 1s in row0,1,4: three non-zero. That's more than other columns. So the output's middle column would have 5s. But what about the other columns?\n\nAlternatively, the output's shape depends on the presence of non-zero elements in certain regions. For example:\n\n- If the top row of the input has non-zero elements, the output's top row is all 5s.\n\n- If the middle column of the input has non-zero elements, the output's middle column is all 5s.\n\nThe test input's top row has four 1s, so output top row is 5s. Middle column (column2) has three 1s, so output middle column is 5s. Thus, combining these, the output would have a top row all 5s and a middle column all 5s, forming a T-shape like Example0's output.\n\nSo the test input's output would be:\n\n[5,5,5]\n\n[0,5,0]\n\n[0,5,0]\n\nWhich matches the pattern seen in Examples0,4,5."

        "cot_1": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. So, the input is a 5x5 grid of numbers, and the output is a 3x3 grid where all the numbers are either 0 or 5. Hmm. Let's look at the training examples to see what's going on.\n\nStarting with Example 0. The input has a bunch of 2s and 0s. The output is a center column filled with 5s and the top and bottom rows are 5s except the middle. Wait, maybe it's something to do with the positions of the non-zero numbers in the input?\n\nLooking at Example 0's input: Let's note where the 2s are. The first row has a 2 in position 0. The second row has 2s in positions 1 and 4. The third row has 2s in positions 0 and 3. The fourth row has 2s in positions 3 and 4. The fifth row has 2s in positions 2 and 3. \n\nThe output is a 3x3 grid. So maybe each cell in the output corresponds to a certain region in the input. Like, maybe the input is divided into a 3x3 grid of regions, and if a certain condition is met in that region, the output cell is 5, else 0.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is based on the frequency or arrangement of the non-zero numbers. Let's check another example.\n\nTake Example 1. The input has 1s in some positions. The output is a cross shape: the middle row is all 5s, and the center column. So maybe the output is forming a cross when certain criteria are met. But how does that relate to the input?\n\nWait, maybe the non-zero numbers in the input are forming a certain pattern that translates to the output. For instance, the output's cross might be related to the majority of non-zero elements being in certain rows or columns.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is determined by the sum of the non-zero elements in specific regions. Let me try to see.\n\nAnother approach: The output is 3x3, which is smaller than 5x5. So perhaps each output cell corresponds to a 3x3 area in the input, but since the input is 5x5, maybe overlapping regions? Or maybe the input is divided into 3x3 sections, but that's not straightforward.\n\nWait, maybe it's about the positions of the non-zero numbers. Let's see if the output's 5s are where certain rows and columns in the input have non-zeros. For example, in Example 0's output, the first row is all 5s. Maybe the first row of the output corresponds to the top rows of the input. But how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is a heatmap of the number of times a particular row and column in the input have non-zero values. Let's check.\n\nLooking at Example 0's input:\n\nRow 0: [2,0,0,0,0] \u2192 only column 0 has a 2.\nRow 1: [0,2,0,0,2] \u2192 columns 1 and 4.\nRow 2: [2,0,0,2,0] \u2192 columns 0 and 3.\nRow 3: [0,0,0,2,2] \u2192 columns 3 and 4.\nRow 4: [0,0,2,2,0] \u2192 columns 2 and 3.\n\nNow, the output is three rows. Maybe the output rows correspond to the count of non-zero entries in certain rows of the input. For example, output rows might be aggregations of input rows.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is determined by the positions where the majority of non-zero entries in the input form a 'T' or 'I' shape, leading to the cross in the output. But how?\n\nWait, looking at the output structures:\n\nIn Example 0, the output is:\n\n[5,5,5]\n[0,5,0]\n[0,5,0]\n\nWhich is like a vertical line in the middle column and a horizontal line in the top row. But how does that relate to the input?\n\nAnother idea: Maybe the output is created by looking at the middle row and middle column of the input. If the middle row (third row) of the input has non-zero elements in certain columns, it affects the output. Similarly for the middle column.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is a 3x3 grid where each cell (i,j) corresponds to whether the input's row i+1 and column j+1 (since 5x5 to 3x3) have a certain pattern. For example, the center of the input would be row 2, column 2. But how?\n\nWait, let's think of the 5x5 input as a grid, and the output 3x3 as a compressed version. Maybe each output cell represents a 2x2 area in the input. But 5x5 isn't exactly divisible by 2x2. Alternatively, maybe each output cell is determined by the presence of non-zero elements in specific positions around it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's a matter of counting the number of non-zero elements in each of the 3x3 regions. For example, the top-left 3x3 of the input, then the top-middle, etc. But the input is 5x5, so perhaps overlapping regions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is determined by the positions of the non-zero elements in the input. For example, if the non-zero elements form a certain shape when connected, the output is a cross.\n\nWait, perhaps the output is a representation of the major columns and rows where the non-zero numbers are concentrated. For example, if most non-zero numbers are in the first column, then the output's left column is all 5s. But looking at Example 0's input: the non-zero numbers are spread across columns 0,1,3,4,2, etc. But the output has the top row as all 5s. Not sure.\n\nLooking at Example 2's input:\n\n[3,0,0,0,0]\n[0,0,0,3,3]\n[0,3,3,0,0]\n[0,3,0,3,0]\n[3,0,3,3,0]\n\nOutput is:\n\n[0,0,5]\n[0,0,5]\n[5,5,5]\n\nSo the bottom row of the output is all 5s, and the rightmost column has 5s. Hmm. Let's check the columns in the input. The input has 3s in column 0 (rows 0 and 4), column 3 (rows 1,3,4), column 4 (row 1), column 2 (rows 2,4), column 1 (row 2,3). Not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps the output is determined by the sum of the non-zero elements in each of the three vertical sections (left, middle, right) of the input. Let's see:\n\nFor example, the input is divided into three vertical sections. Each section's sum of non-zero numbers contributes to the output columns.\n\nBut the input is 5 columns. Dividing into left (cols 0-1), middle (col 2), right (cols 3-4). Then sum for each section. For example, in Example 0:\n\nRow 0: col0 has 2, others 0. So left=2, middle=0, right=0.\nRow1: cols1 and4 (so left has 2, right has 2)\nRow2: col0 and3 \u2192 left=2, right=2\nRow3: cols3 and4 \u2192 right=4\nRow4: cols2 and3 \u2192 middle=2, right=2.\n\nSumming all rows per section:\n\nLeft: row0 (2) + row1 (2) + row2 (2) + row3 (0) + row4 (0) \u2192 total 6\nMiddle: row4 (2) \u2192 total 2\nRight: row1 (2) + row2 (2) + row3 (4) + row4 (2) \u2192 10.\n\nBut how would that map to the output [5,5,5], [0,5,0], [0,5,0]. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is based on which rows and columns have the most non-zero entries. For example, the output's rows and columns that have 5s correspond to the rows and columns in the input with the highest counts.\n\nWait, in Example 0's input, looking at columns:\n\nColumn 0: rows0,2 \u2192 2 entries.\nColumn1: row1 \u2192 1.\nColumn2: row4 \u2192 1.\nColumn3: rows2,3,4 \u2192 3 entries.\nColumn4: rows1,3 \u2192 2.\n\nSo column3 has the highest count. Similarly, rows:\n\nRow0: 1\nRow1: 2\nRow2: 2\nRow3: 2\nRow4: 2\n\nNo clear maximum. But the output's top row is all 5s, middle column. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, the output is a 3x3 grid where the middle cell (1,1) is 5 if there's a certain condition. But in Example 0, the output's middle is 5, but so are others.\n\nWait, maybe the output is a kind of heatmap where each cell represents a direction. For instance, if non-zero elements are concentrated in the top part, the top row of the output is filled. But how?\n\nAlternatively, think of the 5x5 grid as a grid, and the 3x3 output is the number of times each 3x3 area in the input (moving window) has a certain property. But with 5x5, a 3x3 window would have positions starting at (0,0), (0,1), (0,2); (1,0), etc., but the output is 3x3. So each output cell is the sum of the 3x3 window starting at (i,j). But for a 5x5 input, the windows would be (0,0) to (2,2), (0,1) to (2,3), (0,2) to (2,4), then (1,0) to (3,2), etc. But the output is 3x3. Let's check.\n\nFor Example 0's input, the top-left 3x3 window (rows 0-2, cols 0-2) would have:\n\nRow0: [2,0,0]\nRow1: [0,2,0]\nRow2: [2,0,0]\n\nSum of non-zero: 2+2+2 =6. The next window (cols 1-3):\n\nRow0: [0,0,0]\nRow1: [2,0,0]\nRow2: [0,0,2]\n\nSum: 2+2=4. And so on. But how would this lead to the output 5s? Maybe if the sum exceeds a certain threshold, but in Example 0's output, the top row is all 5s, which might correspond to the first row of windows having high sums. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is determined by the positions of the non-zero elements in the input, translated into the center of the output. For example, if the input has non-zero elements in certain positions, the output's center is 5. But again, not clear.\n\nLooking at Example 6's input:\n\nInput:\n[0,3,0,3,0]\n[3,3,0,0,0]\n[0,3,0,0,0]\n[0,0,3,0,0]\n[3,3,3,0,0]\n\nOutput:\n[0,0,5]\n[0,0,5]\n[5,5,5]\n\nThe output has the bottom row as all 5s and the rightmost column as 5s. Let's look at the input's non-zero positions. The first row has 3s in columns 1 and 3. Second row has 3s in 0 and 1. Third row column 1. Fourth row column2. Fifth row columns 0,1,2. So the rightmost part (columns 3 and 4) in the input have 3s in the first row (column3) and nothing else. But the output's rightmost column (third column) is all 5s. Hmm. Maybe the rightmost columns in the input (columns 3 and 4) have a certain number of non-zero entries. For Example 6, column3 has a 3 in row0 and row4 (but row4's input is [3,3,3,0,0], so columns 3 is 0. Wait, perhaps the sum of columns 3 and 4. Let's check:\n\nIn Example 6's input:\n\nColumn3: row0 (3), row4 (0) \u2192 sum 3.\nColumn4: row0 (0), nothing else. Sum 0.\n\nSo columns3+4 sum to 3. Maybe that's not the pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is determined by the majority of non-zero elements in certain regions. For instance, the output's rows correspond to the input's top, middle, and bottom thirds, and the columns correspond to left, middle, and right. But with 5 rows and columns, how to split into thirds.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each output cell represents the presence of a non-zero in a specific position relative to the center of the input. For example, the output's top row corresponds to the input's top rows, left column to left columns, etc.\n\nWait, let's think of the 5x5 input as a grid and the 3x3 output as overlaying it. Maybe each output cell corresponds to a specific cell in the input. For example:\n\nThe output's (0,0) cell corresponds to the input's (0,0), (0,4), (4,0), (4,4) cells. If any of those are non-zero, then 5 is placed. But not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the output is formed by checking the four corners and the center. But the output is 3x3. Not sure.\n\nAnother angle: The output in all examples has 5s arranged in a cross (like Example1 and others) or in a bottom row and right column (Example2 and 6). So perhaps the output is formed based on the majority of non-zero entries in certain directions. For example, if most non-zero entries are in the top rows, then the top row of the output is 5s. Or if they're concentrated in the right, then the right column of the output is 5s.\n\nLooking at Example2's output:\n\n[0,0,5]\n[0,0,5]\n[5,5,5]\n\nSo right column and bottom row. In the input for Example2, let's see where the non-zeros are:\n\nRows 0: column0\nRow1: columns3,4\nRow2: columns1,2\nRow3: columns1,3\nRow4: columns0,2,3\n\nSo the non-zeros are spread out. But in the output, the bottom row (third row of output) is all 5s, and the right column (third column) is all 5s. Hmm. How does that relate?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is created by counting the number of non-zero elements in each of the three horizontal bands (top third, middle third, bottom third) and vertical bands (left third, middle third, right third) of the input. The bands with the highest counts get 5s in the corresponding output rows and columns.\n\nFor example, split the 5 rows into three groups: top two (rows 0-1), middle one (row2), bottom two (rows3-4). Similarly columns: left two (0-1), middle one (2), right two (3-4). Then count non-zeros in each band.\n\nLet's apply this to Example0:\n\nInput:\n\nRow0: 2,0,0,0,0 \u2192 left two: 2,0 (non-zero count 1)\nRow1:0,2,0,0,2 \u2192 left two: 0,2 (count 1); right two: 0,2 (count1)\nRow2:2,0,0,2,0 \u2192 left two:2,0 (count1); right two:2,0 (count1)\nRow3:0,0,0,2,2 \u2192 right two:2,2 (count2)\nRow4:0,0,2,2,0 \u2192 right two:2,0 (count1)\n\nHorizontal bands:\n\nTop (rows0-1): total non-zeros = 1 (row0) + 2 (row1) =3\nMiddle (row2): 2 non-zeros\nBottom (rows3-4): 2 (row3) +2 (row4) =4\n\nSo the bottom band has the highest count \u2192 output's bottom row is 5s. But Example0's output's top row is all 5s. So that's not matching.\n\nVertical bands:\n\nLeft (cols0-1): row0 has 1, row1 has1, row2 has1, row3 has0, row4 has0 \u2192 total 3\nMiddle (col2): row4 has1 \u2192 total1\nRight (cols3-4): row0 has0, row1 has2, row2 has1, row3 has2, row4 has1 \u2192 total 6\n\nSo right vertical band has the highest \u2192 output's right column is 5s. But in Example0's output, the top row is all 5s. Doesn't fit.\n\nThis approach doesn't align with the example outputs.\n\nAlternative approach: Looking at the output patterns. For example, in Example0, the output is a horizontal line at the top and a vertical line in the middle. So the top row and middle column are 5s. Let's see if in the input, the non-zero elements are arranged such that the top row has non-zeros in all columns, but the input's top row has only a single 2. Not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps the output is a result of the non-zero elements in the input forming a kind of arrow or direction. For example, if the non-zero elements are mostly in the top-left to bottom-right diagonal, the output might have a diagonal line. But in Example0's input, the non-zeros are spread out.\n\nAlternatively, the output could be the sum of the non-zero elements in each possible 3x3 grid that can be formed in the input. For example, the input is 5x5, so there are 3x3 possible 3x3 grids (starting at positions (0,0), (0,1), (0,2), then (1,0), etc.). The sum for each grid is calculated, and the output is the positions where the sum is above a certain threshold. But since the outputs are all 0s and 5s, maybe if the sum is non-zero, it's 5. But let's check.\n\nTake Example0's input. The first 3x3 grid (rows0-2, cols0-2) has non-zero elements:\n\nRow0: 2,0,0\nRow1:0,2,0\nRow2:2,0,0\nSum of non-zero elements: 2+2+2=6. So if the output's (0,0) cell is 5 if this sum is non-zero, but Example0's output's (0,0) is 5, which matches. But the next grid (rows0-2, cols1-3):\n\nRow0:0,0,0\nRow1:2,0,0\nRow2:0,0,2\nSum: 2+2=4. So output's (0,1) would be 5. But in Example0's output, the first row is [5,5,5], which would mean all three grids in the top row have non-zero sums. Let's check third grid (cols2-4):\n\nRow0:0,0,0\nRow1:0,0,2\nRow2:0,2,0\nSum:2+2=4. So yes, that's non-zero. So all three grids in the top row of the 3x3 output would have 5s. Then middle row grids:\n\nGrid (1,0): rows1-3, cols0-2:\n\nRow1:0,2,0\nRow2:0,0,0\nRow3:0,0,0\nSum:2 \u2192 output (1,0) is 5. But in Example0's output, the middle row is [0,5,0]. So this doesn't align. Because the sum for grid (1,0) is 2, which is non-zero, but the output is 0. So this approach is incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is a 3x3 grid where each cell is 5 if the corresponding row and column in the input have a certain number of non-zero entries. For example, if the input's row i has a non-zero and column j has a non-zero, then output cell (i,j) is 5. But since the input is 5x5 and output is 3x3, perhaps rows and columns are grouped.\n\nFor example, rows are grouped into top 2, middle 1, bottom 2. Columns similarly. Then for each group, count how many non-zero entries are there. If the count exceeds a threshold, the output cell is 5.\n\nLet's try this for Example0:\n\nGrouping rows into:\n\nTop group: rows0-1\nMiddle group: row2\nBottom group: rows3-4\n\nColumns grouped into:\n\nLeft: cols0-1\nMiddle: col2\nRight: cols3-4\n\nFor each group intersection:\n\nTop-left: sum of non-zero in rows0-1, cols0-1.\n\nRow0: col0=2 \u2192 count1.\nRow1: col1=2 \u2192 count1.\nTotal 2. If threshold is say 2, then this cell would be 5.\n\nTop-middle: cols2. Rows0-1.\n\nRow0:0, row1:0 \u2192 0. So 0.\n\nTop-right: cols3-4, rows0-1.\n\nRow0:0, row1:0,2 (cols3-4 in row1 are 0 and 2 \u2192 sum1.\n\nSo top-right count is 1. If threshold is 2, then no. But in Example0's output, the top row is all 5s. So this approach may not fit.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output cell (i,j) is 5 if there's a non-zero in the input's row i*2 and column j*2. For example, since 5 rows to 3 rows, each output row corresponds to every other input row. Let's see.\n\nFor Example0's output:\n\nOutput row0 \u2192 input rows0 and 1.\n\nBut the output row0 is [5,5,5]. So if there's any non-zero in the corresponding input rows and columns.\n\nWait, perhaps the output is a downsampled version where each cell in the output corresponds to a 2x2 area in the input, except for the last row and column which may have overlap. For 5x5 input, this might be tricky. Alternatively, maybe each output cell is determined by the presence of a non-zero in certain specific cells of the input.\n\nAnother idea: The output's 3x3 grid represents the central part of the input. For instance, rows 1-3 and columns 1-3 of the input. If any of those cells have non-zero values, the output cell is 5. But in Example0's input, the center cell (row2, col2) is 0. But the output's center is 5. So that's not it.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by looking for the positions where the non-zero elements in the input form a cross. For example, if there's a vertical line and a horizontal line in the input's non-zero elements, the output is a cross. But how?\n\nLooking back at Example6's input:\n\nThe non-zero elements are in columns 0,1,2,3, etc. The output is the bottom row and right column. Hmm. Not sure.\n\nAnother approach: Let's look at the positions of the non-zero numbers and see if they form a pattern that corresponds to the output. For example, maybe the output is a 3x3 grid where each cell corresponds to a direction (e.g., top-left, top-center, etc.) and a cell is 5 if there's a cluster of non-zero elements in that direction of the input.\n\nAlternatively, the output could be determined by the majority of non-zero elements in certain quadrants. For example, if most non-zero elements are in the top-left quadrant, the output's top-left cell is 5.\n\nAlternatively, think of the output as the number of times each of the 3x3 cells' positions in the input's central 3x3 grid have non-zero entries. Wait, the input is 5x5, so the central 3x3 is rows1-3, columns1-3. If there are non-zero entries in those positions, then the output is 5. Let's check.\n\nExample0's central 3x3:\n\nRow1: [0,2,0]\nRow2: [0,0,0]\nRow3: [0,0,0]\n\nColumns1-3:\n\nRow1: 2,0,0 \u2192 col1 has 2.\nRow2:0,0,2 \u2192 col3 has 2.\nRow3:0,0,2 \u2192 col3 has 2.\nSo in the central 3x3, there are non-zeros at (1,1), (2,3), (3,3). But the output's middle cell (1,1) is 5, and others. Not sure.\n\nThis seems not to fit. Maybe I'm missing something.\n\nLooking back at the outputs: Most of them have a cross pattern (like Example0,1,3,4,5), while others have a bottom row and right column (Example2,6). Let's see if the cross is formed when the majority of non-zero elements are in the middle row and middle column of the input. Or when the input's non-zero elements form a cross.\n\nIn Example0's input, the non-zero elements are in rows 0,1,2,3,4 and columns 0,1,3,4,2. So not forming a cross. But the output is a cross. Hmm.\n\nAlternative idea: The output's rows correspond to the input's rows 0, 2, 4, and columns 0, 2, 4. So each output cell is 5 if the input's corresponding cell is non-zero. But let's check:\n\nExample0's input row0, col0 is 2 \u2192 output (0,0) is 5. But output row0 has all 5s. However, input's row0, col2 and 4 are 0. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, the output is determined by the count of non-zero elements in each of the output's corresponding rows and columns. For example, output row0 is 5 if the input's top row has non-zero elements, output column0 is 5 if the input's left column has non-zero elements. But how does that form a 3x3 grid.\n\nWait, output has 3 rows and 3 columns. Maybe:\n\nOutput row0 represents the presence of non-zero in input rows 0 and 1.\n\nOutput row1 represents input row2.\n\nOutput row2 represents input rows3 and4.\n\nSimilarly, columns:\n\nOutput column0 represents input cols0 and1.\n\nOutput column1 represents input col2.\n\nOutput column2 represents input cols3 and4.\n\nThen, for each output cell (i,j), if there's a non-zero in input rows corresponding to i and cols corresponding to j, then it's 5.\n\nLet's test this with Example0.\n\nExample0's input rows0 and1 (output row0) have non-zeros in cols0,1,4 (cols0 and1 belong to output column0 and column0, and cols4 is part of output column2 (cols3-4).\n\nSo output row0 would have columns0 and 2 as 5, but the actual output row0 is all 5s. So this may not work.\n\nAlternatively, if any of the input rows/columns in the group have a non-zero, the output cell is 5.\n\nFor Example0's output row0 (input rows0 and1), any non-zero in these rows across any column. For columns grouped as:\n\ncols0-1 \u2192 output column0.\n\ncols2 \u2192 output column1.\n\ncols3-4 \u2192 output column2.\n\nSo for output row0, column0: any non-zero in rows0-1 and cols0-1.\n\nIn Example0, rows0-1 and cols0-1: row0 has 2 in col0, row1 has 2 in col1. So yes, non-zero. So output (0,0) is 5.\n\nColumn1: cols2. Rows0-1: no non-zeros. So output (0,1) is 0. But actual output is 5.\n\nThis doesn't fit. So this approach is incorrect.\n\nAnother approach: Perhaps the output is a reflection of the input's symmetry. For example, if the input is symmetric along a certain axis, the output has a cross. But checking Example0's input, it's not symmetric.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by the sum of the non-zero elements in each row and column, and the output is a 3x3 grid where rows and columns with sums exceeding a threshold are marked as 5.\n\nFor Example0:\n\nRow sums: 2, 4, 4, 4, 4. So all rows except row0 have sum >=4. Column sums: 4 (col0), 2 (col1), 2 (col2), 6 (col3), 4 (col4). Highest columns are col3 and 4.\n\nBut output's top row is all 5s. So this doesn't align.\n\nHmm. This is challenging. Let's try another angle. Let's look at the test input and see if we can find a pattern.\n\nTest Input:\n\n[0,3,0,3,3]\n[0,0,3,0,0]\n[3,0,0,0,0]\n[0,0,3,0,3]\n[0,0,0,0,3]\n\nLooking for non-zero positions:\n\nRow0: cols1,3,4 (3s)\nRow1: col2\nRow2: col0\nRow3: col2,4\nRow4: col4\n\nNow, the output is a 3x3 grid. Let's think of possible patterns from the training examples. For instance, Example2 and 6 have outputs where the bottom row and right column are 5s. Let's see if this test input's non-zeros are concentrated in the right and bottom.\n\nIn the test input, the right columns (3-4) have 3s in row0 (3,4), row3 (4), and row4 (4). Also, row0 has 3s in col3 and4, row3 has col4, row4 has col4. Additionally, row2 has a 3 in col0. Row1 has a 3 in col2. Row3 has a 3 in col2.\n\nSo the right columns (3 and4) have multiple 3s. The bottom rows (rows3 and4) have 3s. So perhaps the output will have the right column and bottom row filled with 5s, like Example2 and 6.\n\nLooking at the outputs for Example2 and 6:\n\nExample2 output:\n\n[0,0,5]\n[0,0,5]\n[5,5,5]\n\nExample6 output:\n\n[0,0,5]\n[0,0,5]\n[5,5,5]\n\nSo in both cases, the bottom row is all 5s, and the right column (third column) is all 5s. The test input's non-zeros in the right columns and bottom rows (rows3-4) might lead to the same pattern.\n\nSo the test output would be:\n\n[0,0,5]\n\n[0,0,5]\n\n[5,5,5]\n\nWhich matches the structure of Example2 and 6. So the pattern might be that when non-zero elements are concentrated in the rightmost columns and/or bottom rows, the output's right column and bottom row are filled with 5s. Otherwise, if they form a cross (like in Example1 and others), the output is a cross.\n\nSo for the test input, the answer should be:\n\n[0,0,5]\n\n[0,0,5]\n\n[5,5,5]",

        "cot_2": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. So, we have these input matrices and output matrices. The inputs are 5x5 grids with numbers like 0, 1, 2, 3, etc., and the outputs are 3x3 grids with mostly 0s and 5s. Hmm.\n\nFirst, looking at the training examples. Let's take Example 0. The input is a 5x5 matrix. The output is a 3x3 matrix. Maybe the output is derived by looking at certain positions in the input and converting them into 5s if they meet a condition. Let's see the input and output for Example 0.\n\nIn Example 0's input, the first row is [2,0,0,0,0]. The output starts with [5,5,5]. Wait, how does a 5x5 become 3x3? Maybe each output row is derived from three rows of the input. Or perhaps it's about the positions of non-zero elements. Let me look for a pattern.\n\nLooking at Example 0's output: the first row is all 5s. The second row is [0,5,0], and the third is [0,5,0]. So maybe the middle element is 5, and the first row is all 5s. But how does that relate to the input?\n\nWait, maybe the output represents the presence of certain numbers in specific regions of the input. For instance, maybe each cell in the 3x3 output corresponds to a 3x3 section of the input, but since the input is 5x5, maybe overlapping or specific positions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by counting the number of non-zero entries in each of the nine possible 3x3 blocks of the input. But that might not fit. Let's check.\n\nTake Example 0's input. Let's see the non-zero entries. The input has 2s in certain positions. The output is three rows. Let's see:\n\nOriginal input:\n\nRow 0: [2, 0, 0, 0, 0]\nRow 1: [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]\nRow 2: [2, 0, 0, 2, 0]\nRow 3: [0, 0, 0, 2, 2]\nRow 4: [0, 0, 2, 2, 0]\n\nSo the non-zero elements are at positions (0,0), (1,1), (1,4), (2,0), (2,3), (3,3), (3,4), (4,2), (4,3).\n\nThe output is:\n\n[5,5,5]\n[0,5,0]\n[0,5,0]\n\nHmm. Maybe the output is determined by the positions of the majority number or some alignment. Alternatively, maybe the output is a heatmap where each cell in the 3x3 represents a central position in the input, and if the surrounding cells (like in a cross shape) meet a certain condition. Let's think about that.\n\nAnother approach: the output could be based on the positions of the non-zero elements in the input. For example, if we imagine the 5x5 grid divided into a 3x3 grid where each cell in the output corresponds to a 3x3 area of the input. But the input is 5x5, so maybe each output cell is a sum or presence of a certain number in overlapping regions.\n\nWait, perhaps the output's 3x3 grid corresponds to the central positions of the input's 5x5 grid. Let's consider that each output cell (i,j) is determined by the input's positions around (i+1, j+1). For example, the center of the 5x5 is (2,2), so maybe the output's center (1,1) relates to that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by looking at the diagonals or columns in the input. Let's take Example 0's output. The first row of the output is all 5s. So perhaps when there are non-zero elements in the first row of the input, that affects the output's first row. But in Example 0, the input's first row has a 2, but the output's first row is all 5s. Not sure.\n\nLooking at another example. Example 1's input has 1s and 0s. The output is [0,5,0], [5,5,5], [0,5,0]. So middle row is all 5s. Maybe the output's rows correspond to the presence of a certain number in the corresponding columns of the input. Let's check.\n\nIn Example 1's input:\n\nRow 0: all zeros.\nRow 1: [0,0,1,1,1]\nRow 2: [0,1,0,1,1]\nRow 3: [0,1,0,1,0]\nRow 4: [0,0,0,0,1]\n\nThe output's middle row is all 5s. Maybe when there are non-zero entries in the middle columns of the input rows. Let's see. For example, the middle column (index 2) in each input row. Row 1 has 1 at column 3 and 4. Hmm, not sure.\n\nWait, maybe each row in the output corresponds to a certain row in the input. For instance, the output has three rows, which might correspond to rows 0, 2, 4 of the input. But Example 0's output first row is all 5s. Let's check input rows 0, 2, 4. Input row 0 has a 2. Row 2 has 2,0,0,2,0. Row 4 has 0,0,2,2,0. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is determined by the positions where a certain number appears the most in each column. For example, if in the input's columns, a certain number dominates, that column in the output is 5. But how does that map to 3x3?\n\nAnother angle: looking at the outputs, the 5s form a cross or vertical line. For example, in Example 0, the output is a horizontal line at the top and a vertical line in the middle. Wait, the first row is all 5s, and the middle column is all 5s. So maybe the output is a combination of horizontal and vertical lines where certain conditions are met.\n\nAlternatively, think of the output as a 3x3 grid where each cell is 5 if the corresponding position in the input has a certain pattern. For example, maybe the central cell (1,1) in the output corresponds to the center (2,2) of the input. But in Example 0's input, (2,2) is 0. So that might not be.\n\nWait, maybe the output is a transformation where the 5x5 grid is compressed into 3x3 by taking the sum of each 2x2 or 3x3 block. But since the output numbers are 0 or 5, it's probably a binary condition (presence or absence of a certain value) rather than a sum.\n\nLooking at Example 2's input:\n\n[3,0,0,0,0]\n[0,0,0,3,3]\n[0,3,3,0,0]\n[0,3,0,3,0]\n[3,0,3,3,0]\n\nThe output is:\n\n[0,0,5]\n[0,0,5]\n[5,5,5]\n\nSo the bottom row of the output is all 5s. Maybe this corresponds to the lower part of the input. For instance, the input's last two rows (rows 3 and 4) have multiple 3s. But how does that translate to the output's bottom row?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is determined by the positions of the non-zero elements in the input. For example, in Example 2, the non-zero elements are in the right and bottom parts. The output's last row is all 5s. Maybe each row in the output corresponds to a quadrant or region in the input.\n\nWait, another thought: perhaps the output is based on the presence of a certain number in each of the three main diagonals of the input. For example, main diagonal, and the two adjacent diagonals. But the output is 3x3, which might represent these three diagonals. Let's check Example 0.\n\nExample 0's input:\n\nLooking at the main diagonal (0,0), (1,1), (2,2), (3,3), (4,4). Those elements are 2,2,0,2,0. The output's first row is all 5s, which could correspond to the presence of 2s in the first part. But not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the output could be formed by checking which rows in the input have the highest number of non-zero elements. For instance, in Example 0's input, row 1 has two 2s, row 2 has two 2s, row 3 has two 2s, row 4 has two 2s. Maybe the output's rows indicate where the majority of non-zero elements are concentrated. But I'm not seeing the direct connection.\n\nAnother approach: look for the position of the non-zero elements in each example and see how they correlate with the output. For Example 0, the output has a top row of 5s and a vertical middle column. Let's see the input's non-zero positions:\n\n(0,0), (1,1), (1,4), (2,0), (2,3), (3,3), (3,4), (4,2), (4,3).\n\nIf we imagine the 5x5 grid divided into a 3x3 grid, perhaps each output cell covers a 2x2 area. For example:\n\nThe output's (0,0) cell covers rows 0-1 and columns 0-1.\n\n(0,1) covers rows 0-1, columns 2-3.\n\nWait, maybe the 5x5 is divided into 3x3 regions, each overlapping. Alternatively, the output's 3x3 could represent the central 3x3 of the input. But the input is 5x5. The central 3x3 would be rows 1-3 and columns 1-3. Let's check Example 0's central 3x3:\n\nRow 1: [0,2,0,0,2] \u2192 columns 1-3: 2,0,0\nRow 2: [2,0,0,2,0] \u2192 columns 1-3: 0,0,2\nRow 3: [0,0,0,2,2] \u2192 columns 1-3: 0,0,2\n\nSo the central 3x3 is:\n\n[2,0,0]\n[0,0,2]\n[0,0,2]\n\nBut how does that become the output? The output for Example 0 is:\n\n[5,5,5]\n[0,5,0]\n[0,5,0]\n\nNot sure. Maybe the presence of non-zero in certain positions. The output's first row has all 5s. If the central 3x3 has non-zero in the top row, but in Example 0's central top row (row1, columns1-3) has 2,0,0. Only the first element is non-zero. Not matching the all 5s.\n\nAlternative idea: the output is the result of a convolution. For instance, a kernel that detects certain patterns. For example, a kernel that checks if there's a non-zero element in specific positions. But with the outputs being 3x3, perhaps each output cell corresponds to a 3x3 area in the input. For a 5x5 input, using a 3x3 kernel with stride 1, you get a 3x3 output. Let's see.\n\nTake Example 0's input. Applying a kernel that counts the number of non-zero elements in each 3x3 window.\n\nBut in Example 0's output, the top row is all 5s. Let's compute the number of non-zeros in each 3x3 window.\n\nFor the top-left window (rows 0-2, columns 0-2):\n\nRow0: [2,0,0]\nRow1: [0,2,0]\nRow2: [2,0,0]\nNon-zeros: 3 (2, 2, 2)\nBut the output's [0][0] is 5. If the threshold is 3 or more, then 3 would trigger 5. But in the output's [0][0] is 5. So perhaps that's the case. Let's check.\n\nBut for the top-left window, there are 3 non-zeros (positions (0,0), (1,1), (2,0)). So maybe if the count is >=3, it becomes 5. Then, the top-middle window (rows 0-2, columns 1-3):\n\nRow0: [0,0,0]\nRow1: [2,0,0]\nRow2: [0,0,0]\nNon-zeros: 1. So output would be 0, but in Example 0's first row, it's 5. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the kernel checks for a certain pattern. For example, if the center of the 3x3 window is non-zero, then output 5. But in Example 0's top-left window, the center (1,1) is 2, so output would be 5. But the output for Example 0's first row is all 5s, which would imply that all three windows in the first row of the output have centers that are non-zero. Let's check.\n\nIn the input, for the first row of the output (which would correspond to windows in rows 0-2):\n\nFirst window (columns 0-2): center at (1,1) is 2 \u2192 5.\nSecond window (columns 1-3): center at (1,2) is 0 \u2192 0.\nThird window (columns 2-4): center at (1,3) is 0 \u2192 0.\n\nBut the output's first row is all 5s. So this doesn't match.\n\nAlternative approach: perhaps the output is based on the sum of each diagonal in the input. Let's take Example 0's input. The main diagonal (0,0), (1,1), (2,2), (3,3), (4,4) has values 2,2,0,2,0. Sum is 6. The anti-diagonal (0,4), (1,3), (2,2), (3,1), (4,0) has 0,0,0,0,0. Sum is 0. Not sure how that would map to the output.\n\nAlternatively, the output could be a 3x3 grid where each cell represents a 2x2 block in the input. The 5x5 input has 4x4 blocks, but that doesn't fit the 3x3 output. Hmm.\n\nWait, another thought. Maybe the output is formed by taking the positions where a certain number appears three times consecutively in a row or column. For example, if a row in the input has three consecutive non-zero numbers, then the output's corresponding row has 5s. Let's check Example 1's input.\n\nExample 1's input:\n\nRow 1: [0,0,1,1,1] \u2192 three 1s at the end. So perhaps the output's middle row (since row 1 is in the middle of the input) becomes all 5s. The output for Example 1 is [0,5,0], [5,5,5], [0,5,0]. The middle row is all 5s, which could correspond to the input's row 1 having three consecutive 1s. Similarly, let's check other examples.\n\nExample 0's input: row 1 has [0,2,0,0,2]. No three consecutive. So why is the output's first row all 5s? That might not fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's columns instead of rows. Let's check Example 1's input. The columns where there are three consecutive non-zeros. For example, column 3 in the input has 1,1,1,1,0. So three consecutive 1s. Maybe the corresponding column in the output becomes 5s. The output's columns for Example 1 are [0,5,0], [5,5,5], [0,5,0]. The middle column is all 5s. So maybe the middle column of the output corresponds to column 3 of the input, which has consecutive non-zeros. That might make sense.\n\nBut Example 0's input columns: let's look for columns with three consecutive non-zeros. In Example 0's input:\n\nColumn 0: 2,0,2,0,0 \u2192 no three in a row.\nColumn 1: 0,2,0,0,0 \u2192 no.\nColumn 2: 0,0,0,0,2 \u2192 no.\nColumn 3: 0,0,2,2,2 \u2192 rows 3 and 4 have 2,2, but not three.\nWait, column 3 in input has 0,0,2,2,2. So rows 2,3,4 have 2,2,2. Three consecutive in column 3. So perhaps the output's column 3 (which in the output is index 2) would be all 5s. Let's see Example 0's output: the first row is all 5s. Wait, the output is a 3x3 grid. If the columns in the output correspond to the input's columns 1, 3, and 5 (but 5 columns, maybe columns 0-2 as left, 2-4 as right?), not sure.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Let's look for a different pattern.\n\nAnother observation: the outputs have 5s forming a kind of arrow or specific shape. For example, in Example 0, the output has a horizontal line on top and a vertical line in the middle. Example 1 has a horizontal line in the middle. Example 2's output has a vertical line on the right and a horizontal line at the bottom. So perhaps the output shape indicates the direction where most non-zero elements are located.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is a 3x3 grid where each cell is 5 if the corresponding position in the input has a non-zero in a certain pattern. For instance, the center of the output (1,1) corresponds to the center of the input (2,2). Let's check Example 0: input's (2,2) is 0, but output's (1,1) is 5. So that doesn't fit.\n\nWait, maybe the output is determined by the positions of the majority number in the input. For example, if the input has more 2s in certain regions, the output reflects that. But in Example 0, all non-zero are 2s. The output has a top row of 5s. Maybe the 5s indicate regions where the 2s are concentrated. Like, if the top rows of the input have more 2s, the output's top row is all 5s.\n\nLooking at Example 0's input: rows 0 and 2 have 2s on the left. Row 1 has 2s in the middle and end. Rows 3 and 4 have 2s on the right. So maybe the output's top row is 5s because there are 2s in the left and middle parts of the input.\n\nAlternatively, the output is the transpose of the middle three rows and columns of the input. But not sure.\n\nAnother angle: the output is a 3x3 grid where each cell is 5 if the corresponding cell in the input's central 3x3 area has a certain number. For example, input's rows 1-3 and columns 1-3. Let's check Example 0:\n\nCentral 3x3 input:\n\nRow1: [0,2,0,0,2] \u2192 columns 1-3: 2,0,0\nRow2: [2,0,0,2,0] \u2192 columns 1-3: 0,0,2\nRow3: [0,0,0,2,2] \u2192 columns 1-3: 0,0,2\n\nSo central 3x3 is:\n\n[2,0,0]\n[0,0,2]\n[0,0,2]\n\nThe output is:\n\n[5,5,5]\n[0,5,0]\n[0,5,0]\n\nNo obvious connection. The central cell (1,1) of the output is 5, but the input's (2,2) is 0. So that's not it.\n\nWait, perhaps the output is a 3x3 grid where each cell corresponds to the number of times a certain value appears in each diagonal. For example, the main diagonal, anti-diagonal, etc. But I'm not sure.\n\nLet me think differently. All the outputs consist of 5s arranged in a cross or a vertical/horizontal line. For example:\n\n- Example 0: top row is all 5s, middle column all 5s.\n- Example 1: middle row all 5s, middle column all 5s.\n- Example 2: bottom row all 5s, right column all 5s.\n- Example 3: similar to Example 1.\n- Example 4: top row all 5s, middle column all 5s.\n- Example 5: top row all 5s, middle column all 5s.\n- Example 6: bottom row all 5s, right column all 5s.\n\nSo the output is either a horizontal line (top, middle, or bottom row) combined with a vertical line (left, middle, right column) of 5s. The other cells are 0.\n\nThe key seems to be identifying which row and column in the output are all 5s, which depends on the input.\n\nSo, the question is: what in the input determines which row and column are all 5s in the output?\n\nLooking at Example 0 and 4, the output's top row is all 5s. Let's see their inputs.\n\nExample 0's input has non-zero elements in row 0 (position 0), row 1 (positions 1 and 4), row 2 (positions 0 and 3), row 3 (positions 3 and 4), row 4 (positions 2 and 3). The top row of the output being all 5s might be related to the first row of the input having a non-zero element. But Example 4's input's first row is [2,0,2,0,2], which has multiple non-zeros. But how does that lead to the top row of the output being all 5s?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the horizontal line in the output corresponds to the rows in the input where the sum is the highest. For Example 0, the sum of each row:\n\nRow0: 2 \u2192 sum 2\nRow1: 2 + 2 = 4\nRow2: 2 + 2 =4\nRow3: 2 + 2=4\nRow4: 2 +2=4\n\nThe highest sum is 4 in rows 1,2,3,4. But the output's top row is all 5s. Doesn't align.\n\nAnother idea: the output's horizontal line (row) is determined by the earliest row in the input that contains a certain pattern. For example, the first row with a non-zero element in the first position. In Example 0, the first row has a non-zero (2) in position 0. The output's top row is all 5s. Similarly, Example 4's first row has non-zero elements. But Example 2's output has the bottom row all 5s. Let's check Example 2's input. The first row has a 3 in position 0. So that would not explain the bottom row being 5s.\n\nHmm. Maybe it's about the vertical and horizontal lines formed by the non-zero elements in the input. For example, if the non-zero elements form a cross in the input, the output reflects that. But looking at Example 0's input, the non-zero elements are scattered. So that's not it.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output's horizontal line corresponds to the row in the input where a certain number (like 2,3, etc.) appears most frequently. For Example 0, all non-zeros are 2s. Rows 1,2,3,4 have two 2s each. Row0 has one. So the highest is rows 1-4. But the output's first row is all 5s. Not sure.\n\nWait, another approach: the output's 3x3 grid represents the corners, edges, and center of the input's 5x5 grid. For example:\n\n- The output's (0,0) corresponds to input's (0,0)\n- (0,1) corresponds to input's (0,2)\n- (0,2) corresponds to input's (0,4)\n- (1,0) corresponds to input's (2,0)\n- (1,1) corresponds to input's (2,2)\n- (1,2) corresponds to input's (2,4)\n- (2,0) corresponds to input's (4,0)\n- (2,1) corresponds to input's (4,2)\n- (2,2) corresponds to input's (4,4)\n\nThen, each output cell is 5 if the corresponding input cell is non-zero. Let's test this with Example 0.\n\nInput's (0,0)=2 \u2192 output (0,0)=5\nInput's (0,2)=0 \u2192 output (0,1)=5? No. But output's first row is all 5s. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, the output's 3x3 grid is the central part of the input's 5x5 grid. For example:\n\nOutput's (0,0) is input's (1,1)\nOutput's (0,1) is input's (1,2)\nOutput's (0,2) is input's (1,3)\nOutput's (1,0) is input's (2,1)\nOutput's (1,1) is input's (2,2)\nOutput's (1,2) is input's (2,3)\nOutput's (2,0) is input's (3,1)\nOutput's (2,1) is input's (3,2)\nOutput's (2,2) is input's (3,3)\n\nThen, if any of these positions are non-zero in the input, the output cell is 5. Let's check Example 0.\n\nInput's (1,1)=2 \u2192 output (0,0)=5\nInput's (1,2)=0 \u2192 output (0,1)=0\nBut Example 0's output first row is all 5s. So this can't be right.\n\nHmm. This is tricky. Let's try to look for another pattern. Notice that in all examples, the output has either:\n\n- A horizontal line (all 5s in a row) and a vertical line (all 5s in a column), forming a cross.\n- Or a horizontal line at the bottom and vertical line on the right (Example 2 and 6).\n\nLooking at the examples where the vertical line is on the right (Examples 2 and 6), let's see their inputs. In Example 2's input, there are 3s in the rightmost columns (columns 3 and 4) in rows 1, 3, 4. The output's vertical line is on the right (third column). So maybe the vertical line in the output corresponds to the rightmost columns in the input having non-zero elements.\n\nSimilarly, in Example 6's input, non-zero elements are in the right and bottom parts. The output's vertical line is on the right and horizontal at the bottom.\n\nSo perhaps the output's vertical line (column) is determined by where the majority of non-zero elements are in the input's columns. If non-zero elements are concentrated on the left, middle, or right. Similarly, the horizontal line (row) is determined by the concentration in the input's rows.\n\nFor example, in Example 0, the input's non-zero elements are spread across the left (columns 0, 2) and right (columns 3,4). But the output's vertical line is middle. Hmm, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the vertical line in the output corresponds to the column in the input that has the most non-zero entries. Let's check Example 0:\n\nColumns in input:\n\nColumn 0: 2,0,2,0,0 \u2192 2 non-zeros.\nColumn 1: 0,2,0,0,0 \u2192 1.\nColumn 2: 0,0,0,0,2 \u21921.\nColumn 3:0,0,2,2,2 \u21923.\nColumn4:0,2,0,2,0 \u21922.\n\nSo column 3 has the most non-zeros (3). The output's vertical line is middle column (index 1). Hmm, not matching. So maybe not.\n\nAnother idea: the output's vertical line corresponds to the position of the last occurrence of the non-zero number in the middle row of the input.\n\nFor example, in Example 0's middle row (row 2), the non-zero elements are at 0 and 3. Maybe the last occurrence is column 3. So output's vertical line is the third column (index 2). But Example 0's output vertical line is middle column (index 1). Doesn't fit.\n\nThis is getting frustrating. Let's try to find a pattern between the input's non-zero positions and the output's 5s.\n\nLooking at Example 0's output: top row all 5s, middle column all 5s.\n\nIn the input, the non-zero elements are in columns 0,1,3,4. So maybe the output's vertical line is the middle column if the input's middle column (column 2) has no non-zeros, which is true for Example 0. But Example 1's input's middle column (column 2) has 1,0,0,0,0. So one non-zero. But Example 1's output has a middle column of 5s. Not sure.\n\nWait, maybe the output's vertical line is determined by the column that has the most number of non-zero elements, and the horizontal line by the row with the most. Let's check Example 0:\n\nColumns: column 3 has 3 non-zeros (most).\nRows: rows 1,2,3,4 have 2 non-zeros each. So the output's horizontal line could be the top row (row0) which has one non-zero, but that doesn't make sense. Example 0's output has a horizontal line at the top row, but the row with the most non-zeros is rows 1-4. Doesn't align.\n\nAlternative approach: think of the output as a 3x3 grid where each cell is 5 if the corresponding cell in the input's 5x5 grid, when folded into 3x3, has a non-zero. For example, folding the 5x5 into 3x3 by combining cells. For instance:\n\nEach output cell is the combination of certain input cells. Like output (0,0) is input (0,0) + input (0,4) + input (4,0) + input (4,4). But this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is created by rotating the input 45 degrees or some other transformation. But I can't see it.\n\nWait, looking at the test input:\n\n[0,3,0,3,3]\n[0,0,3,0,0]\n[3,0,0,0,0]\n[0,0,3,0,3]\n[0,0,0,0,3]\n\nThe non-zero elements are:\n\nRow0: indices 1,3,4 (3s)\nRow1: index 2 (3)\nRow2: index 0 (3)\nRow3: indices 2,4 (3s)\nRow4: index4 (3)\n\nSo the non-zeros are in the top row (cols 1,3,4), row1 middle, row2 left, row3 middle and right, row4 right.\n\nLooking at the training examples, the output's vertical line is determined by the rightmost column if non-zeros are in the right part. For example, Example 2 and 6 have outputs with vertical line on the right. In Example 2's input, non-zeros are in columns 3 and 4. In Example 6's input, non-zeros are in column 0 and 3, but output's vertical line is right. Wait, no.\n\nExample 6's input:\n\n[0,3,0,3,0]\n[3,3,0,0,0]\n[0,3,0,0,0]\n[0,0,3,0,0]\n[3,3,3,0,0]\n\nNon-zero positions: row0 has 3 at 1 and 3, row1 has 3s at 0 and 1, row2 has 3 at 1, row3 has 3 at 2, row4 has 3s at 0,1,2. So columns 0,1,2,3. But the output's vertical line is on the right (third column). That doesn't align. So maybe that's not the pattern.\n\nAnother observation: in examples where the output's vertical line is on the right (Examples 2 and 6), the input has non-zero elements in the last column. For Example 2, input's last column has 0,3,0,0,0 (row1 has 3, row3 has 0, etc. Not sure. Maybe the number of non-zeros in the last column is higher. Example 2's last column: row0 0, row1 3, row2 0, row3 0, row4 0. Only one non-zero. Example 6's last column: row0 0, row1 0, row2 0, row3 0, row4 0. No non-zeros. So that doesn't fit.\n\nWait, but in Example 2's output, the vertical line is on the right. The input's column 3 has 3s in rows 1 and 3. Maybe that's the reason. But how?\n\nAlternatively, the vertical line in the output is determined by the column where the majority of non-zeros are in the input. For example, if non-zeros are mostly in the right columns, vertical line is right. If in the middle, middle. If left, left. Similarly for horizontal line.\n\nIn Example 0's input, non-zeros are spread across columns 0,1,3,4. Maybe the vertical line is middle because of the middle columns having some non-zeros. Not sure.\n\nPerhaps the vertical line in the output corresponds to the column that contains the first occurrence of the non-zero number in the middle row (row 2) of the input. For Example 0, row2's non-zero is at column0 and 3. First is 0, which is left, but output's vertical line is middle. Doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, the vertical line is determined by the last column in which a non-zero appears in the middle row. In Example 0's row2, last non-zero is column3 (third column), which would correspond to output's middle column (index 1). Hmm, but 3rd column in input is index 3, which maps to output's column 2 (if output columns are 0-2). Not sure.\n\nThis is really challenging. Let's try to look for another pattern. All the outputs have exactly three 5s in the vertical line and three in the horizontal line. For example, Example 0 has three 5s in the top row and three in the middle column. But the output is a 3x3 grid, so each row and column has three cells. So it's either a full row, full column, or combinations.\n\nLooking at Example 2's input:\n\nThe non-zero elements are 3s. Let's see their positions:\n\nRow0: (0,0) 3\nRow1: (1,3), (1,4) 3s\nRow2: (2,1), (2,2) 3s\nRow3: (3,1), (3,3) 3s\nRow4: (4,0), (4,2), (4,3) 3s\n\nThe output is:\n\n[0,0,5]\n[0,0,5]\n[5,5,5]\n\nSo bottom row all 5s and right column all 5s. Maybe this is because the majority of the 3s are in the bottom rows and right columns. Let's see: rows 4 has three 3s, row3 has two, row2 has two. So bottom rows have more. Columns 3 has four 3s (rows1,3,4), column4 has one, column0 has two. So column3 has the most. But the output's vertical line is on the right (column 2). So perhaps it's not directly about majority.\n\nAnother approach: in the output, the horizontal line indicates which third of the input (top, middle, bottom) has the most non-zeros. The vertical line indicates which third (left, middle, right) has the most non-zeros.\n\nFor Example 0's input:\n\nRows:\n\nTop third: rows 0-1 \u2192 non-zeros: row0 has 1, row1 has 2 \u2192 total 3.\nMiddle third: rows 2-3 \u2192 row2 has 2, row3 has 2 \u2192 total 4.\nBottom third: row4 \u2192 2 non-zeros.\nSo middle third has the most. But the output's horizontal line is top row. Doesn't fit.\n\nColumns:\n\nLeft third (cols 0-1): column0 has 2, column1 has 1 \u2192 total 3.\nMiddle third (col2): 1.\nRight third (cols3-4): column3 has 3, column4 has 2 \u2192 total 5.\nSo right third has the most. The output's vertical line is middle. Doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. Not matching.\n\nAlternatively, the output's horizontal line corresponds to the row in the input where the first non-zero appears. For Example 0, the first non-zero is row0, so output's top row is all 5s. For Example 2, the first non-zero is row0, but output's horizontal line is at the bottom. Doesn't fit.\n\nLet me try to think of the output as the sum of the input's rows and columns in some way. For example, the output's rows are the sum of certain rows, and columns are sum of certain columns, but normalized to 5 if above a threshold.\n\nExample 0's output top row is all 5s. Maybe the sum of input's rows 0,1,2. Sum of row0:2, row1:4, row2:4. Total sum for output row0: 10. But how does this become 5s. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the output's horizontal line is determined by the first row in the input that has a non-zero, and the vertical line by the first column with a non-zero. For Example 0, first non-zero is row0, column0. But output's vertical line is middle. Doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, the output's horizontal line is the row that has the earliest occurrence of a non-zero in the input's columns. For example, if the earliest non-zero in the input is in column0, then output's vertical line is left. If in column2, then middle, etc.\n\nIn Example 0, the earliest non-zero is (0,0), which is column0. So output's vertical line would be left. But the output's vertical line is middle. So that doesn't work.\n\nThis is really challenging. Let's look for a different pattern. All outputs have either:\n\n- Top horizontal line and middle vertical (cross)\n- Middle horizontal and middle vertical (cross)\n- Bottom horizontal and right vertical (like Example 2 and 6)\n\nLooking at the test input:\n\nNon-zero positions are:\n\nRow0: 1,3,4\nRow1: 2\nRow2:0\nRow3:2,4\nRow4:4\n\nSo non-zeros are in columns 0,1,2,3,4. Rows 0,1,2,3,4.\n\nThe non-zeros are mostly in the top (row0 has three) and right (columns3 and4) parts. So maybe the output's horizontal line is top and vertical line is right. So the output would have a top row all 5s and right column all 5s. But looking at similar examples like Example 2 and 6, which have bottom and right. Alternatively, if the majority of non-zeros are in the top and right, the output would be top horizontal and right vertical. But I'm not sure.\n\nLooking at Example 2's output, which has bottom horizontal and right vertical. The input's non-zeros are spread across multiple rows but columns 3 and4 have some. The output's vertical line is right.\n\nIn the test input, the non-zeros in column3 are in row0 and row3. Column4 has non-zeros in row0, row3, row4. So right columns (3 and4) have several non-zeros. Maybe the vertical line is right. The horizontal line could be top since row0 has three non-zeros. But the output would then be a cross at top row and right column. However, none of the training examples have that combination. Training examples have either top+middle, middle+middle, bottom+right.\n\nWait, perhaps the horizontal line in the output is determined by the row that has the most non-zero elements, and the vertical line by the column with the most.\n\nIn the test input:\n\nRows:\n\nRow0:3 non-zeros\nRow1:1\nRow2:1\nRow3:2\nRow4:1\n\nSo row0 has the most. So horizontal line would be top row.\n\nColumns:\n\nColumn0:1\nColumn1:1\nColumn2:2 (row0, row3)\nColumn3:2 (row0, row3)\nColumn4:3 (row0, row3, row4)\n\nSo column4 has the most. So vertical line would be right column.\n\nIf the output is a cross of top row and right column, but looking at the training examples, there's no such example. But according to Example 2 and 6, when the vertical line is right, the horizontal line is bottom. So maybe there's another rule.\n\nAlternatively, when the vertical line is right, the horizontal line is bottom. So if column4 has the most, then the horizontal line is bottom. But in the test input, row0 has the most non-zeros. So this is conflicting.\n\nAlternatively, the horizontal line is determined by the row where the last occurrence of the non-zero is. For example, in the test input, the last non-zero is in row4. So horizontal line would be bottom.\n\nBut row4 has only one non-zero, which is in column4. So maybe the output would have bottom row and right column.\n\nThat would match Example 2 and 6's pattern. In Example 2, the last non-zero is in row4, column3. So bottom row and right column. So output is bottom horizontal and right vertical.\n\nSo in the test input, the last non-zero is in row4, column4. So maybe the output's horizontal line is bottom row and vertical line is right column. The output would be:\n\n[0,0,5]\n[0,0,5]\n[5,5,5]\n\nWhich is the same as Example 2 and 6's output. So the answer would be:\n\n[0,0,5]\n[0,0,5]\n[5,5,5]\n\nBut I need to verify this with the training examples.\n\nIn Example 0, the last non-zero is in row4, column3. So according to this rule, the output would be bottom row and right column. But Example 0's output is top row and middle column. So this doesn't fit. So the rule must be different.\n\nAlternative approach: looking at the examples where the output's vertical line is on the right (Examples 2 and 6), their inputs have non-zero elements clustered in the lower-right part. For Example 2's input:\n\nRow4 has non-zeros in columns0,2,3. Not really lower-right. But maybe the majority of non-zeros are in the lower-right quadrant. For Example 6's input, non-zeros are in row4 (left) and row0 (middle). Not sure.\n\nThis is really challenging. Maybe I should look for a pattern involving the positions of the non-zero elements and their sum.\n\nAnother idea: the output's horizontal line is determined by the row in the input that has the earliest occurrence of a non-zero element in the middle column (column 2). If there's no non-zero in column2, then look for other criteria.\n\nIn Example 0, column2 has no non-zeros, so the horizontal line is determined by the first row with a non-zero. Row0 has a 2, so horizontal line is top. Vertical line is determined by the first column with a non-zero. Column0 has a 2, so vertical line is left. But the output's vertical line is middle. Doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, the vertical line is determined by the column where the majority of non-zeros are in the middle row (row2). For Example 0, row2's non-zeros are in column0 and 3. So majority is column0 and3. Which column is chosen? Not sure.\n\nThis is taking too long. Let me try to make an educated guess based on the test input. The test input's non-zeros are concentrated in the top row and right columns (columns3 and4). In Examples 2 and 6, the output has a vertical line on the right and horizontal line on the bottom. But in the test input, the non-zeros in the bottom are in row3 and4. So perhaps the output for the test input is:\n\n[0,0,5]\n[0,0,5]\n[5,5,5]\n\nWhich matches Examples 2 and 6. So the answer is this."
