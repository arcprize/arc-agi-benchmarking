        "cot_1": "Okay, let's see. I need to figure out the pattern that transforms the input matrices into the output matrices in the training examples, then apply that to the test input.\n\nLooking at Example 0:\nInput:\n[0, 0, 0]\n[0, 2, 0]\n[2, 4, 2]\n\nOutput:\n[4, 0, 4]\n[0, 2, 0]\n[2, 4, 2]\n\nHmm. The bottom row is [2,4,2], which in the output stays the same. The middle row's 2 remains. The top row becomes [4,0,4]. Maybe it's related to the numbers below? Like, adding or some operation from the lower rows upwards.\n\nIn Example 1:\nInput has a bottom row [8,8,3,8,8]. The output's row above that becomes [0,0,8,0,0], but then the rows above start getting 3s. Like in the third row from bottom (now [0,3,0,3,0]). Wait, maybe numbers are propagating upwards in a certain pattern. For example, the 3 in the bottom row's center might be influencing the rows above. But how?\n\nIn Example 2:\nThe input has a bottom row [6,1,1,1,6], and the output's row above is [0,6,6,6,0], then the row above that becomes [1,0,0,0,1]. So the 1s from the bottom are moving up, but mirrored? Like the 1s in the bottom are at positions 0 and 4 (assuming 0-based index), and in the third row (from bottom) they appear at positions 0 and 4 again, but in the next row up, maybe?\n\nWait, maybe each layer above is taking some elements from the layer below. For example, in Example 0, the top row's 4s are perhaps from the sum or difference of the elements below. Let's check. The middle element in the input's middle row is 2. The row below has 2,4,2. Maybe the 4s in the top row are 2*2? Or maybe it's taking the value from the row two below. Let me check.\n\nLooking at Example 3's input:\nThe bottom two rows are [2,2,4,4,4,2,2] and [0,0,2,2,2,0,0]. The output for the row two above that (which is the fourth row from bottom) is [0,4,0,0,0,4,0]. Wait, the 4s here. The original row in the input is all zeros. So where do the 4s come from? The row two below (in input) is [2,2,4,4,4,2,2], which has 4s. Maybe each non-zero element in a row affects the rows above in some way, propagating upwards with a certain step.\n\nAnother approach: looking for symmetry. In Example 0's output, the top row is symmetric with 4s at the ends. Similarly, Example 1's output has symmetric 3s. So perhaps the transformation is creating a symmetric pattern in the upper rows based on the lower rows.\n\nLooking at the positions where numbers appear in outputs. In Example 1's input, the bottom row has 3 in the center. In the output, the third row from bottom has 3s in positions 0 and 4 (if 0-based) in the second row from top (the third row from bottom) of the output. Then the row above that (fourth row from bottom) has 3s in positions 0 and 4 again? Wait, the output for Example 1 is:\n\nOUTPUT:\n[0,0,0,0,0]\n[3,0,0,0,3]\n[0,3,0,3,0]\n[0,0,8,0,0]\n[8,8,3,8,8]\n\nSo the third row from bottom (third line in the output) is [0,3,0,3,0]. The next row up (second line in output) is [3,0,0,0,3]. The bottom two rows in the output are same as input's bottom two rows. So perhaps each non-zero number in a row is being propagated upwards, but mirrored. For example, the 3 in the center of the bottom row (input) is in position 2. Then in the row above, maybe the positions adjacent (1 and 3) get 3, but in the output, the row above has 3s at positions 1 and 3. Then the next row up has 3s at 0 and 4. Wait, but in the output for Example 1, the third row from bottom (the third line) has 3s at 1 and 3. The row above (second line) has 3s at 0 and 4. So the 3 is moving outwards each layer.\n\nSo the pattern seems to be that each non-zero number in a row propagates upwards, but each layer above adds the number at positions moving one step left and right. Like, in Example 1, the center 3 (position 2) in the bottom row leads to 3s at positions 1 and 3 in the row above. Then in the next row up, they move to positions 0 and 4. Then in the next rows, maybe they would continue, but in the example there are no higher rows. \n\nSimilarly, in Example 0, the middle row has a 2 in the center. The row above it (top row) has 4s at the ends. Wait, but how does 2 become 4? Maybe the value doubles each time it propagates up a layer. Let's see. In Example 0, the middle row's center is 2, and the top row has 4s. Then perhaps each step up doubles the value. But then in Example 1, the 3 in the bottom row's center propagates up to 3s in the next rows. So maybe not doubling. Wait, maybe the numbers are taken as-is but shifted outward each layer.\n\nAlternatively, the numbers in the upper rows are copies of the numbers from the lower rows, but moved outward. So for each non-zero in a row, the next layer up (the row above) has that number placed one position left and right. If there's a conflict, they add up. But how?\n\nWait, let's take Example 0:\n\nInput middle row: [0,2,0]. Output top row: [4,0,4]. How does 2 lead to 4? Maybe it's 2 multiplied by 2. But then in Example 1, the 3 in the bottom row leads to 3s above, not multiplied. So maybe the multiplier depends on the row's distance.\n\nWait, perhaps the layers above each non-zero cell in a row get filled with the same value, but mirrored outward each layer. For instance, in Example 0, the middle row's 2 is in the center. Then the row above (top) has 2s in the left and right positions. But in the output, they are 4s. So maybe each time you go up a layer, the value is doubled. So middle row's 2 becomes top row's 4, placed symmetrically. But in Example 1, the bottom row's center is 3. The next row up (row 3) has 8, which is original. Then in row 2 (third row from bottom in output), the 3s are at positions 1 and 3. Then the next row up (row 1) has 3s at 0 and 4. So each time, moving outward, but the value remains 3. So why in Example 0, the 2 becomes 4? Maybe it's a different rule.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each non-zero number in a row causes the two adjacent positions in the row above to be filled with the same number. But when moving up, each step the numbers are placed further out. For example, in Example 0, the middle row's center 2 would cause the row above to have 2s in positions 0 and 2 (but that's not the case). Wait, the top row's output is [4,0,4]. Hmm. Maybe the numbers are being copied up and their sum is taken. But how?\n\nAnother idea: looking at the layers. The bottom rows in the output are the same as the input. Then, each row above is generated based on the row below it. For example, each cell in the current row (except the bottom rows) is determined by the cells below it. Maybe a cell is the sum of the two cells below it (left and right). Let's test this.\n\nIn Example 0's top row:\n\nThe output is [4, 0,4]. Let's look at the cells below. For the first cell (index 0) in the top row, the cells below are middle row's index 0 (0) and maybe something else. Wait, if it's the sum of the cell directly below and the next, but not sure. For the top row's first element, the cells directly below in middle row and bottom row? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the top row's elements are the sum of the two elements in the row below's adjacent positions. For example, top[0] = middle[0] + middle[1], but middle[0] is 0 and middle[1] is 2: 0+2=2, which doesn't match the output 4. So that's not right.\n\nWait, maybe each non-zero in a lower row propagates upwards, and each time they move one step left and right, and their value is added. So for example, in Example 0's middle row's center 2, when moving up a layer, it splits into left and right, each with 2. Then those 2s, when moving up another layer (if any), split again. But in the output of Example 0, the top row has 4s. So maybe the values are added when they reach the same position. So in the middle row's center 2, when moving up to the top row, it would split into left and right. But the top row's positions 0 and 2. Wait, but the top row is the first row. So maybe the 2 in the middle splits into 2 and 2, placed in positions 0 and 2 of the row above. Then their sum is 4 each. Wait, that's confusing.\n\nAlternatively, each time a number propagates up a row, it's placed in the positions to the left and right of its current position, and the values are added if multiple sources contribute. Let's try Example 0:\n\nMiddle row: [0,2,0]. So the 2 is at position 1. The row above would receive 2 in positions 0 and 2. So the top row would be [2,0,2]. But the output is [4,0,4]. Hmm, so that's not matching. So maybe each time the value is doubled. So 2 becomes 4 in each direction. But then why? Maybe it's multiplied by the number of steps. Or perhaps the value is cumulative. Like, each layer above adds the same value again. But not sure.\n\nLooking at Example 3's input and output:\n\nInput's bottom two rows are [2,2,4,4,4,2,2] and [0,0,2,2,2,0,0]. The output has rows:\n\n... (previous rows)\n\n[4,0,0,0,0,0,4]\n\n[0,4,0,0,0,4,0]\n\n[0,0,2,2,2,0,0]\n\n[2,2,4,4,4,2,2]\n\nSo the fourth row from bottom (the line starting with [4,0...]) has 4s at the ends. The row below that (the fifth from bottom) has 2s at the ends. The 4s could be derived from the 4s in the bottom row's center. Let's see: the bottom row has 4s at positions 2,3,4. The next row up has 2s at 2,3,4. Then the row above that (the [0,4,0,0,0,4,0] line) has 4s at positions 1 and 5. Then the next row up (the [4,0,...] line) has 4s at 0 and 6. So perhaps each layer up, the 4s move outward by one position, and their value doubles. Because the bottom row's 4s are at center, next layer up has 2s (maybe halved?), but in the example, the next layer has 2s, then the next up has 4s. Wait, that's confusing. Alternatively, maybe the 4s in the bottom row are propagating upwards, each time moving left and right, and their values are the same as the original. So the bottom row has 4s in positions 2,3,4. Then the next row up (from input) has 2s in positions 2,3,4. So maybe those 2s are not part of the propagation. Alternatively, the output's 4s in higher rows are coming from the 4s in the bottom row. So the 4s in the bottom row (positions 2,3,4) would propagate upwards. The row above would have 4s at positions 1,2,3,4,5. But in the output, the row two above (the [0,4,0,0,0,4,0] line) has 4s at 1 and 5. Then the next row up has 4s at 0 and 6. So each layer up, the 4s move one position left and right, but only keeping the outermost ones. Or maybe each non-zero in a row creates two copies in the row above, one left and one right. But how do the values work?\n\nAlternatively, the pattern is that for each non-zero cell in a row, the cell two rows above and shifted left and right by the distance equal to the number of rows above gets filled with that value. But this seems complex.\n\nAnother angle: in all the examples, the output's upper rows are created by mirroring and propagating certain values upwards. The lower rows remain the same. So the transformation is applied from the bottom up. For each row starting from the bottom, we look for non-zero elements and then modify the rows above accordingly.\n\nMaybe the rule is: For each non-zero value in a row, two positions in the row two levels above (i.e., two rows up) are set to that value, placed symmetrically at positions that are (current position - distance) and (current position + distance), where the distance increases by one each layer up. But not sure.\n\nWait, let's look at Example 1's test case:\n\nInput's bottom row is [8,8,3,8,8]. The output's row above that is [0,0,8,0,0]. Then the row above that (third from bottom) becomes [0,3,0,3,0]. Then the next row up (second from bottom) is [3,0,0,0,3]. So the 3 from the center (position 2) in the bottom row appears two rows up (third from bottom) at positions 1 and 3. Then two rows above that (second row from top) at positions 0 and 4.\n\nSo the 3 in position 2 of the bottom row (row 4, 0-based) affects row 3 (directly above) but in Example 1's output, row 3 is [0,0,8,0,0], which doesn't have 3s. Wait, perhaps it's skipping a row. Let's see:\n\nIn Example 1's output:\n\nRow 4 (original input's bottom row) remains [8,8,3,8,8].\n\nRow 3 becomes [0,0,8,0,0].\n\nRow 2 (third from bottom) is [0,3,0,3,0].\n\nRow 1 is [3,0,0,0,3].\n\nSo the 3s are in row 4 (position 2), then in row 2 (positions 1 and 3), then in row 0 (positions 0 and 4). The steps between these rows are two rows apart. So from row 4 (bottom) to row 2 (two rows up), the 3 is split into positions 1 and 3. Then from row 2 to row 0 (another two rows up), the 3s are split into positions 0 and 4. So maybe for each non-zero element, every two rows up, it propagates to the left and right by one position. And each time, the value is the same.\n\nBut in Example 0:\n\nInput's middle row (row 1) has 2 at position 1. The top row (row 0) has 4s at positions 0 and 2. So this is only one row up, but the value is doubled. Hmm, conflicting with the previous idea.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's a different rule. Let's look at the distance from the bottom. For example, in Example 1, the 3 is in the bottom row (distance 0). Then it propagates two rows up (distance 2) to positions 1 and 3, then two rows up (distance 4) to 0 and 4. But how does that fit?\n\nAlternatively, the pattern is that for each non-zero element in a row, in the row n rows above (where n is the current row's distance from the bottom), the value is placed in positions shifted left and right by n. For example, in the bottom row (distance 0), the 3 is at position 2. In the row two rows up (distance 2), positions 2-2=0 and 2+2=4? But in Example 1's row 2 (third from bottom), which is two rows above the bottom, the 3s are at positions 1 and 3. So that would be a shift of 1. So perhaps the shift is equal to the number of rows above. Wait, but for Example 0:\n\nThe middle row (row 1) is one row above the bottom (row 2). So the distance from the bottom is 1. The 2 in position 1. Then in the row one up (row 0), it's shifted by 1, so positions 0 and 2. But the output is 4s there. So perhaps the shift is equal to the distance from the original row. So for each non-zero element, when propagating upwards, each step up increases the shift by 1. So the initial row is the source. Then each row above, the shift increases by 1. But how?\n\nAlternatively, each non-zero element in a row propagates upwards, and for each row above, it creates two copies of itself, one shifted left by the number of rows above, and one shifted right. If the shift is more than the row length, it's ignored.\n\nBut in Example 1:\n\nThe 3 is in row 4 (bottom row). The first row above (row 3) has no 3s. Then in row 2 (two rows up), the 3s are shifted left and right by 1 (distance from the source row: 2 rows up). So 2-1=1 and 2+1=3. So positions 1 and 3. Then in row 1 (three rows up), shifted by 2, positions 0 and 4. So each step up, the shift increases by 1. But why in row 3, the shifts would be 0. So 2-0=2, which is the original position, but there's no 3 there. Hmm, maybe this approach isn't right.\n\nAnother observation: in all examples, the non-zero elements in the upper rows of the output mirror the positions of elements in lower rows, but spread outward. For example, in Example 3's output, the 4s in the fourth row from bottom are at positions 0 and 6. The bottom row has 4s at positions 2,3,4. So each 4 in the bottom row would spread outwards as you go up. But how exactly?\n\nAlternatively, the pattern is that each non-zero number in a row creates a \"V\" shape upwards, with the number placed at positions that are mirrored and moving outward each row. For example, a number in the center of the bottom row would create a V shape with the same number, placed at positions moving left and right by one each row up. But in Example 1, the 3 in the center of the bottom row leads to 3s at positions 1 and 3 in the third row from bottom, then 0 and 4 in the row above.\n\nBut why in Example 0, the middle row's 2 leads to 4s in the top row? That breaks the pattern. Unless the numbers are being summed when multiple paths contribute. Wait, in Example 0, the middle row has a 2. The row below (bottom row) has 2s at positions 0 and 2. So perhaps the 2 in the middle row and the 2s in the bottom row are both contributing to the top row's 4s. Because 2 (middle row) plus 2 (from bottom row's positions 0 and 2) would sum to 4. So each cell in a row is the sum of the cell below and the cells diagonally below from the left and right?\n\nWait, let's check Example 0's output. The top row's first element is 4. Let's see what's below it. The middle row's first element is 0, and the bottom row's first element is 2. So 0 (from middle row) plus 2 (from bottom row) equals 2, but the output is 4. So maybe it's something else.\n\nAlternatively, the value in each cell is the maximum value from the cells below. But in Example 0, the top row's first element is 4, which is higher than any below. So that doesn't fit.\n\nWait, perhaps the output is generated by, for each cell in the upper rows, taking the maximum value from the cells two rows below, left and right. For example, in Example 0's top row, cell 0: the cell two below (bottom row's cell 0) is 2. Cell two below and shifted left or right. Hmm, but bottom row is two rows below the top row. The cell 0 in the top row would look at cell 0-1 = -1 (invalid) and 0+1 =1 in the middle row. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, for each cell in row i, it's the sum of the cells in row i+2 (two rows below) at positions j-1 and j+1. So for the top row (row 0), it would take from row 2 (middle row). But Example 0's middle row (row 1) is [0,2,0]. Row 2 (bottom) is [2,4,2]. For top row's cell 0: sum of row 2's cell -1 (invalid) and cell 1 (4). So 4, but output is 4. For cell 2: sum of row 2's cell 1 (4) and cell 3 (invalid). Also 4. So that matches. The middle cell in top row would be sum of row 2's cell 0 (2) and cell 2 (2), 2+2=4. But the output's middle cell is 0. Hmm, that doesn't fit. So maybe this approach isn't correct.\n\nLet's try another approach. Looking for the layers in the output:\n\nIn all examples, the lower rows (bottom two in example 0, bottom two in example 1, etc.) remain unchanged. The transformation starts affecting rows above that. So perhaps the rule is that the bottom k rows are unchanged, and the rows above them are filled with certain values based on the bottom rows.\n\nFor example, in Example 0, the bottom two rows are input's rows 1 and 2. Wait no, the input has three rows. The output's first row (top) is transformed, while the middle and bottom rows remain the same. So the pattern is that the bottom row(s) remain as is, and the rows above are generated based on them.\n\nIn Example 1, the bottom two rows are unchanged. The row above that (third from bottom) is modified. So maybe each row above the bottom row(s) is generated based on the row below.\n\nAlternatively, for each non-zero element in a row, the two elements in the row above (immediately above) and one position to the left and right are set to the same value. If there's already a value there, perhaps it's added. But in Example 0, the middle row's 2 would set the row above's left and right to 2 each. But the output is 4. So maybe adding.\n\nWait, in Example 0's input:\n\nMiddle row has 2 at position 1. The row below (bottom row) has 2s at positions 0 and 2. Then, the top row's positions 0 and 2 would be 2 (from middle row) + 2 (from bottom row's positions 0 and 2) = 4 each. That fits. So the top row's values are the sum of the corresponding positions from the middle row and the bottom row's left and right positions.\n\nWait, let's verify:\n\nFor top row's position 0: middle row's position 0 is 0, bottom row's position 0 is 2. So sum is 0 + 2 = 2? But output is 4. Hmm, not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each cell in the row above is the sum of the cell directly below and the cell diagonally below (left and right). For example, top[0] = middle[0] (0) + bottom[0] (2) + bottom[1] (4)? That would be 0+2+4=6, which doesn't match output's 4.\n\nAlternatively, the value in the cell above is the sum of the cell directly below and the two cells diagonally below. For top[0], it would be middle[0] + bottom[0] + bottom[1]?\n\nBut in Example 0, that would be 0 (middle[0]) + 2 (bottom[0]) + 4 (bottom[1]) = 6. Not matching output's 4.\n\nThis approach isn't working. Let's try to see what's common across all examples.\n\nIn each output:\n\n- The bottommost non-zero rows are the same as input.\n\n- The rows above the bottom have new values that are symmetric.\n\n- The values seem to propagate upwards and outwards, creating a diamond or pyramid shape.\n\nFor instance, in Example 1, the 3 in the bottom row creates a diamond shape with 3s appearing at positions 1 and 3, then 0 and 4.\n\nIn Example 3, the 4s from the bottom rows propagate upwards, creating 4s in positions that spread out each row.\n\nThe pattern seems to be that for each non-zero number in a row, when moving up each row, it's placed in the positions immediately left and right of its current position. So it's like a tree branching out. However, when multiple numbers are present, they might overlap and sum.\n\nLet's test this:\n\nExample 0:\n\nMiddle row has a 2 at position 1. Moving up to the top row, it branches to positions 0 and 2. The bottom row has 2s at 0 and 2. Each of those would branch to positions -1 (invalid) and 1 (for position 0) and 1 and 3 (invalid for position 2). So only position 1 from the bottom row's 0 and 2. But in the top row, positions 0 and 2 are 4. So perhaps each 2 from the middle row and the bottom row contribute to the top row's 4s. But how?\n\nAlternatively, each non-zero number in any lower row contributes to the upper rows by branching outwards. The value in the upper row is the sum of all contributions from lower rows.\n\nIn Example 0:\n\n- Middle row's 2 at position 1 contributes 2 to positions 0 and 2 in the row above.\n\n- Bottom row's 2s at 0 and 2 each contribute 2 to positions -1 (invalid) and 1 (from position 0), and 1 and 3 (invalid from position 2). So only position 1 in the middle row would get 2+2=4. But the top row's positions 0 and 2 are 4. This doesn't align.\n\nThis is getting too complicated. Maybe it's better to think in terms of each non-zero number generating a diamond pattern upwards, with the same value, spreading out each row.\n\nFor example, a number in row r, column c will place the same number in row r-1, columns c-1 and c+1, then in row r-2, columns c-2 and c+2, etc., until the edges are reached.\n\nIn Example 0, middle row (row 1) has a 2 at column 1. Then in row 0, columns 0 and 2 would get 2. But the output has 4s there. So perhaps each layer adds the number again. Or the value is multiplied by the distance from the source.\n\nAlternatively, the numbers are the sum of all the contributions from lower rows. So if a position is reached by multiple paths, the values add up.\n\nFor example, in Example 0's top row:\n\n- The 2 in the middle row's position 1 contributes 2 to top row's 0 and 2.\n\n- The 2s in the bottom row's positions 0 and 2 each contribute 2 to the middle row's positions -1 (invalid) and 1, and 1 and 3 (invalid). So the middle row's position 1 gets 2 from each of the bottom row's 2s. Then, when propagating up to the top row, the middle row's position 1 contributes 2 (original 2) + 4 (from bottom's contributions) = 6? Not sure.\n\nThis is getting too messy. Let's look at another example.\n\nExample 3's output:\n\nThe bottom row has 4s in positions 2,3,4. The row above has 2s in positions 2,3,4. Then the row above that has 4s in positions 1 and 5. Then the row above that has 4s in positions 0 and 6.\n\nSo each 4 in the bottom row's positions 2,3,4 would spread outwards. For example, the 4 at position 2 in the bottom row (row 6) would, in row 5 (the row above), contribute to positions 1 and 3. The 4 at position 3 would contribute to 2 and 4. The 4 at position 4 would contribute to 3 and 5. Then in row 5, the 2,3,4 positions are filled with 2s (from the original input's row 5). So perhaps the output's upper rows are not modified by the lower rows if they already have values. Hmm, but in Example 3's output, the row two above the bottom (row 4) has 4s at positions 1 and 5. These could be from the bottom row's 4s at positions 2 and 4. For example, 4 at position 2 would spread to 1 and 3 in row 5 (but row 5 has 2s in the input), and then from row 5's 2s, perhaps they spread to 0 and 4 in row 4. But this doesn't align with the output.\n\nAlternatively, the output is generated by taking each non-zero value in the original input and creating a pyramid upwards, where each step up and outward adds the same value. For example, in Example 0's input, the middle row's 2 creates a pyramid with 2s in the row above, but in the output it's 4. So maybe the number of layers passed through is multiplied. Like, each time it moves up a layer, the value is doubled.\n\nBut this is speculation. Let's try to find a rule that applies to all examples.\n\nAnother approach: the output's upper rows are created by mirroring the lower rows, but each non-zero value is propagated upwards, creating a pattern where each such value is placed at positions that are k steps away from the original position, where k is the number of rows above.\n\nFor example, in Example 1:\n\nThe 3 in the bottom row (row 4, position 2) propagates to row 2 (two rows up) at positions 2-2=0 and 2+2=4. But no, in the output, row 2 has 3s at positions 1 and 3. So that doesn't fit. Alternatively, k is the number of rows moved up. So from row 4 to row 3 (1 row up), the 3 would be at 1 and 3. Then row 2 (2 rows up), the 3 would be at 0 and 4. But in Example 1's output, row 3 is [0,0,8,0,0], which has no 3s. So perhaps it's every other row.\n\nAlternatively, the propagation happens every two rows. For example, the bottom row's non-zero values affect the row two rows up, then four rows up, etc.\n\nIn Example 1:\n\nThe bottom row's 3 is at row 4. The row two rows up is row 2 (0-based?), which in the output has 3s at 1 and 3. Then two more rows up (row 0) has 3s at 0 and 4. This matches. So the 3 propagates every two rows, shifting left and right by 1 each time.\n\nSimilarly, in Example 3:\n\nThe bottom row has 4s at positions 2,3,4. Two rows up (row 4) has 4s at 1 and 5. Another two rows up (row 2) has 4s at 0 and 6. So each two rows up, the 4s shift left and right by one.\n\nIn Example 0:\n\nThe middle row's 2 is at row 1. Two rows up would be row -1, which doesn't exist. So perhaps the middle row's 2 propagates to the row above (row 0), which is one row up. So in that case, the 2 would shift left and right by 1. Thus, positions 0 and 2. But the output has 4s there. So maybe the value is doubled when propagating to the adjacent rows.\n\nBut why in Example 1, the 3s aren't doubled. They remain 3s. So perhaps the value depends on the original row's value. Or perhaps the value is doubled only when propagating to adjacent rows, not every two rows.\n\nThis seems inconsistent. Maybe there's a different rule.\n\nAlternatively, the pattern is that for each non-zero element in the input, the same value is placed in the upper rows, symmetrically outward, one step per row. For example, each non-zero element creates a diamond shape upwards, with the same value. The existing elements in the upper rows are overwritten or summed.\n\nBut in Example 0's input, the middle row's 2 and bottom row's 2s would create overlapping contributions. The top row's positions 0 and 2 would receive 2 from the middle row's 2 and 2 from the bottom row's 2s. So 2+2=4. That fits the output's 4s.\n\nIn Example 1's bottom row, the 3 at position 2 would contribute 3 to positions 1 and 3 in the row above (row 3), but in the output, row 3 is [0,0,8,0,0], which doesn't have 3s. So maybe the existing values in the input take precedence, and the propagation only affects rows that are all zeros in the input.\n\nAlternatively, the propagation only occurs in rows that are initially all zeros. So in Example 1's input, rows 0,1,2 are all zeros. So those rows are modified. Rows 3 and 4 have non-zero elements and remain the same. Then, the 3 from row 4 propagates into the zeros rows above.\n\nWait, but in Example 0's input, the middle row has a 2, and the top row is all zeros. The output's top row is modified. The middle row remains the same. So perhaps the propagation only affects rows above the original row that are all zeros.\n\nSo the rule could be: For each non-zero element in the input, in every row above it that is entirely zeros in the input, place the same value at positions that are shifted left and right by the number of rows above the original row.\n\nFor example, in Example 1:\n\nThe input's row 4 has a 3. The rows above it (rows 0,1,2,3) have some zeros. The propagation for the 3 would start from row 4. For each row above row 4 that was initially all zeros (rows 0,1,2,3 in input are all zeros except row 3 which has 8 in the center). So row 3 is not all zeros. So the propagation would only affect rows 0,1,2.\n\nFor each row above row 4 that is all zeros in the input:\n\n- The distance from row 4 is (current row index) - 4 (but since it's above, maybe it's 4 - current row index). Let's see. The row directly above row 4 is row 3. But row 3 in the input has a 8 in the center, so it's not all zeros. So the next row is row 2. The distance from row 4 to row 2 is 2. So the shifted positions would be original position (2) minus and plus 2, leading to positions 0 and 4. But in the output, row 2 has 3s at 1 and 3. So this approach isn't matching.\n\nAnother possibility is that each non-zero element in a row generates a pattern in the rows above where each subsequent row has the same value placed one position to the left and right, continuing until the edges of the matrix are reached. This creates a diamond shape. Existing non-zero elements in the input are left as-is.\n\nIn Example 0:\n\nThe middle row's 2 (row 1, position 1) generates a diamond. The row above (row 0) would have 2s at positions 0 and 2. But in the output, these are 4s. So perhaps the value is added to the existing values in those positions. But the input's top row is all zeros, so 2+0=2. But output is 4. Not sure.\n\nBut in Example 1's output:\n\nThe 3 in the bottom row (row 4) generates 3s in row 2 (positions 1 and 3) and row 0 (positions 0 and 4). Each step up two rows, shifting left and right by one. So the 3 propagates two rows up each time, spreading outward.\n\nIn Example 0, the middle row's 2 (row 1) propagates to row 0 (one row up), positions 0 and 2. But the output has 4s there. Maybe if there are multiple sources contributing to the same position, their values sum. For example, in Example 0, the bottom row's 2s at positions 0 and 2 also contribute to row 0's positions. Let's see:\n\nThe bottom row's 2 at position 0 would propagate upwards. For each row above, it shifts left and right. But how far?\n\nFor example, bottom row's 2 at position 0:\n\n- Row 3 (one row up) would have 2 at positions -1 (invalid) and 1.\n\n- Row 2 (two rows up) would have 2 at positions -2 (invalid) and 2.\n\nBut in Example 0's input, the middle row is row 1, which has a 2 at position 1. The bottom row is row 2.\n\nThe middle row's 2 at position 1:\n\n- Row 0 (one row up) has positions 0 and 2.\n\nThe bottom row's 2s at positions 0 and 2:\n\n- Row 1 (one row up) would have 2s at -1 (invalid) and 1 for position 0, and 1 and 3 (invalid) for position 2. So row 1's position 1 would get 2+2=4. But the middle row's position 1 in the input is 2. So in the output, it remains 2, which doesn't fit. \n\nThis approach is not working.\n\nPerhaps the correct pattern is that for each non-zero element in a row, in the row n rows above it (where n is the distance from the bottom), the value is placed at positions (original position - n) and (original position + n). If those positions are within bounds, the value is set. Existing non-zero values in the input are kept.\n\nFor example, in Example 1's bottom row (row 4) with 3 at position 2. The distance from the bottom is 0. For row 3 (distance 1), the positions would be 2-1=1 and 2+1=3. But row 3 in the input has an 8 at position 2, so those positions are 1 and 3, which are zeros in the input. So in the output, those would be set to 3. But in Example 1's output, row 3 (third from bottom) is [0,0,8,0,0], so positions 1 and 3 remain zero. This contradicts the idea.\n\nAlternatively, the distance is counted from the top. For example, the bottom row is the last row. For Example 0's middle row (row 1), which is one row above the bottom (row 2). The distance from the top is row 0: distance 0, row 1: distance 1, row 2: distance 2. Not sure.\n\nThis is taking too long. Given the time I've spent and the need to come up with an answer, I'll try to summarize the pattern based on the examples.\n\nThe pattern seems to be:\n\nFor each non-zero element in the input, create a symmetric pattern upwards, placing the same value at positions that are shifted left and right by the number of rows away from the original row. The original rows remain unchanged. The new values are placed in rows that were initially all zeros.\n\nFor example, in Example 1:\n\nThe bottom row's 3 (position 2) is in row 4. Rows above that (rows 3, 2, 1, 0) are processed. The 3's effect is seen in rows 2 and 0, two and four rows above the original. The positions are shifted by 1 and 2 steps from the center.\n\nIn row 2 (two rows above the original), the 3 appears at positions 1 and 3 (shift 1).\n\nIn row 0 (four rows above), the 3 appears at positions 0 and 4 (shift 2).\n\nWait, four rows above would be row 0 (assuming original is row 4). But row 4 to row 0 is four rows up. Shift would be 4. But positions 2-4 = -2 and 2+4=6, which are invalid. So perhaps this isn't the case.\n\nAlternatively, the shift is the number of rows moved up divided by 2. For Example 1, row 2 is two rows up from row 4. Shift is 1. Row 0 is four rows up, shift is 2. So positions 2-1=1 and 2+1=3 for row 2; positions 2-2=0 and 2+2=4 for row 0. This fits the Example 1 output.\n\nIn Example 0, the middle row's 2 (row 1). The top row is row 0 (one row up). Shift is 1. Positions 1-1=0 and 1+1=2. So 2 is placed at 0 and 2 in row 0. But in the output, those positions are 4. So maybe the value is multiplied by the shift (1+1=2?), but 2*2=4. That fits.\n\nIn Example 3:\n\nThe bottom row's 4s are in row 6 (assuming 0-based). The row two rows up (row 4) has 4s shifted by 1 (positions 2-1=1 and 2+1=3). But in the output, row 4 has 4s at positions 1 and 5. Wait, no. Maybe each 4 in the bottom row's positions 2,3,4 contributes.\n\nFor example, 4 at position 2 in row 6:\n\n- Row 4 (two rows up), shift 1: 2-1=1 and 2+1=3. So contribute to positions 1 and 3.\n\n4 at position 3 in row 6:\n\n- Row 4, shift 1: 3-1=2, 3+1=4.\n\n4 at position 4 in row 6:\n\n- shift 1: 4-1=3, 4+1=5.\n\nSo in row 4, positions 1,3,5 would get 4s. But in the output, row 4 has 4s at positions 1 and 5. Hmm, maybe overlapping contributions. But how?\n\nAlternatively, each non-zero element propagates upwards, creating a diamond pattern with the same value, shifting left and right by one each row. So for Example 0's middle row 2:\n\n- Row 1: 2 at position 1.\n\n- Row 0: 2 at 0 and 2.\n\nBut the output has 4s. So perhaps the value is doubled each row up. But why?\n\nAlternatively, the value is multiplied by the number of steps from the original row. In Example 0's middle row's 2, one step up to row 0: 2*2=4.\n\nIn Example 1's bottom row's 3:\n\n- Two steps up (row 2): 3*2=6, but output is 3. So that doesn't fit.\n\nThis is inconsistent.\n\nGiven the time I've spent, I'll proceed to make an educated guess based on the examples.\n\nThe pattern seems to be that for each non-zero element in the input, in each row above it, the element's value is placed at positions shifted left and right by the number of rows moved up. These values replace any zeros in the upper rows, but existing non-zeros are left intact.\n\nFor example:\n\nTest Input:\n\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n[0,0,0,8,8,8,0,0,0]\n[8,8,8,2,2,2,8,8,8]\n\nThe bottom row is [8,8,8,2,2,2,8,8,8]. The row above is [0,0,0,8,8,8,0,0,0].\n\nFollowing the pattern from training examples, the non-zero elements in the bottom two rows would propagate upwards.\n\nThe 8s in the bottom row's positions 0,1,2 and 6,7,8 (assuming 0-based) and the 2s in positions 3,4,5.\n\nThe 8s in row 8 (bottom row) would propagate upwards. For example, each 8 in row 8 would create 8s two rows up (row 6) shifted left and right by 1. Then two rows up from row 6 (row 4) shifted by 2, and so on.\n\nSimilarly, the 8s in row 7 (positions 3,4,5) would propagate upwards. \n\nFor the 2s in row 8 (positions 3,4,5), they would propagate upwards two rows each time. \n\nThe expected output would have these values propagating upwards in a symmetric pattern.\n\nApplying this to the test input:\n\nThe bottom two rows are:\n\nRow 8: 8,8,8,2,2,2,8,8,8\n\nRow 7: 0,0,0,8,8,8,0,0,0\n\nThe non-zero elements in row 8 are 8s and 2s. \n\nStarting with the 8s in row 8:\n\n- Positions 0,1,2 and 6,7,8 in row 8.\n\nEach of these 8s would propagate upwards two rows, shifting left and right by 1 each time.\n\nFor example, the 8 at position 0 in row 8 would, two rows up (row 6), place 8s at positions -1 (invalid) and 1. So only position 1.\n\nBut since row 8 has 8s in positions 0,1,2, their combined propagation to row 6 would be:\n\n- Position 0's 8 contributes to position 1.\n\n- Position 1's 8 contributes to 0 and 2.\n\n- Position 2's 8 contributes to 1 and 3.\n\nSo row 6 would have 8s at positions 0,1,2,3. But in the input, row 6 is all zeros, so these positions would be filled with 8s. But according to the training examples, the propagation seems to place the same value as the original. However, the 8s may propagate in a pattern where each step up two rows shifts left and right by 1.\n\nSimilarly, the 8s in row 8's positions 6,7,8 would propagate to row 6's positions 5,6,7,8.\n\nThe 2s in row 8's positions 3,4,5 would propagate upwards two rows each time, placing 2s in row 6's positions 2,3,4,5,6, etc.\n\nBut this is getting complex. Alternatively, considering Example 3's output, which has a similar structure with 2s and 4s propagating upwards. The test input's 2s and 8s would create upward patterns.\n\nThe expected output would have rows above the bottom two filled with 8s and 2s propagating upwards, forming symmetric patterns.\n\nBased on the training examples, the pattern seems to be:\n\nFor each non-zero element in a row, in the rows two rows up, four rows up, etc., the element's value is placed symmetrically, shifting left and right by the number of steps (each step is two rows up). For example, a value in row r will appear in row r-2 at positions shifted by 1, row r-4 at positions shifted by 2, and so on.\n\nApplying this to the test input:\n\nThe bottom row (row 8) has 8s at 0,1,2 and 6,7,8, and 2s at 3,4,5.\n\nRow 7 has 8s at 3,4,5.\n\nFor row 8's 8s:\n\n- They will propagate to row 6 (two rows up) at positions shifted by 1.\n\n- So 8 at position 0 in row 8 \u2192 row 6, position -1 (invalid) and 1.\n\n- 8 at position 1 \u2192 row 6, 0 and 2.\n\n- 8 at position 2 \u2192 row 6, 1 and 3.\n\nSimilarly for the 8s at 6,7,8 in row 8:\n\n- 8 at 6 \u2192 row 6, 5 and 7.\n\n- 8 at 7 \u2192 row 6, 6 and 8.\n\n- 8 at 8 \u2192 row 6, 7 and 9 (invalid).\n\nSo row 6 would have 8s at positions 0,1,2,3,5,6,7,8.\n\nBut the 2s in row 8's positions 3,4,5 would propagate to row 6:\n\n- 2 at 3 \u2192 row 6, 2 and 4.\n\n- 2 at 4 \u2192 row 6, 3 and 5.\n\n- 2 at 5 \u2192 row 6, 4 and 6.\n\nSo row 6 would have 2s at 2,3,4,5,6.\n\nBut row 6 in the input is all zeros, so these values would be filled.\n\nHowever, in the output, existing non-zero values (like row 7's 8s) are kept, but the propagation happens in the all-zero rows above.\n\nBut this is getting too complex. Given the time, I'll proceed to construct the output based on the pattern observed in the examples.\n\nThe test input's bottom two rows have 8s and 2s. The output will have these rows unchanged. The rows above will have propagating values. For the 8s in row 8 and 7, they will create patterns of 8s moving upwards. The 2s in row 8 will create patterns of 2s.\n\nIn row 6 (two rows up from row 8), the 8s from row 8 would be placed shifted by 1, leading to positions 1, 3, 5, 7. The 2s would be at 2,4,6. Then, two more rows up (row 4), the 8s would be shifted by 2, leading to positions 0,2,4,6,8, and the 2s shifted by 2 would be at 0,4,8. But this is a guess.\n\nThe correct answer based on the training examples would have the 8s and 2s propagating upwards in a symmetric pattern, creating a diamond shape.\n\nAfter considering all examples and the pattern of propagating non-zero values upwards with symmetry and increasing shifts, the final answer is likely:\n\nFor the test input, the output will have the bottom two rows unchanged. The rows above will have 8s and 2s propagating upwards symmetrically. For example, the 2s from row 8's center will propagate two rows up to positions 3 and 5, then four rows up to positions 2 and 6, etc. Similarly, the 8s will propagate upwards.\n\nThe final output would look something like this:\n\n[2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2]\n\n[0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0]\n\n[0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0]\n\n[0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0]\n\n[0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0]\n\n[8, 8, 8, 2, 2, 2, 8, 8, 8]\n\nBut this doesn't match the training examples' structure. Alternatively, considering that the 8s in row 7 (position 3,4,5) would also propagate upwards.\n\nAlternatively, the test output would have the following structure:\n\nRows 8 and 7 remain the same.\n\nRow 6: 0s except for 8s and 2s propagated from rows 8 and 7.\n\nRow 5: propagated values from rows 8 and 7 shifted further.\n\nBut to align with the training examples, the output should have a diamond pattern moving upwards. For example, each 8 in the bottom rows would create 8s in higher rows, placed symmetrically.\n\nGiven the complexity, the answer likely mirrors the patterns in the examples. For the test input, the rows above the bottom two would have 8s and 2s propagating upwards, each step two rows and shifting outward by one position.\n\nApplying this, the output would be:\n\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n[8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8]\n\n[0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0]\n\n[0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0]\n\n[0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0]\n\n[0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0]\n\n[0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0]\n\n[8, 8, 8, 2, 2, 2, 8, 8, 8]\n\nBut this doesn't include the 2s' propagation. The 2s in row 8's positions 3,4,5 would propagate upwards two rows each time. So in row 6, they would be at positions 2,4,6. Then in row 4, positions 0,4,8. Then in row 2, positions -2 (invalid),4, which doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, considering the 2s in row 8:\n\nRow 6 (two rows up) would have 2s at positions 2,4,6.\n\nRow 4 (four rows up) would have 2s at 0,4,8.\n\nRow 2 (six rows up) would have 2s at positions 4 \u00b13, which is 1 and 7 (invalid for 0-based index of 9 columns).\n\nBut given the test input has 9 columns (indices 0-8), positions 0 and 8 are valid.\n\nSo the output would have:\n\nRow 6: 2s at 2,4,6.\n\nRow 4: 2s at 0,4,8.\n\nRow 2: 2s at 4\u00b12=2 and 6.\n\nRow 0: 2s at 4\u00b13=1 and 7 (invalid? Or perhaps the pattern stops when it reaches the edges).\n\nThis is getting too complicated. Given the time constraints, I'll proceed to write the answer based on the pattern observed in the training examples, assuming that each non-zero element propagates upwards two rows at a time, shifting outward by one each step, and the value remains the same.",

        "cot_2": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. So, looking at the training examples, I need to see how the input is transformed into the output. Let's start with Example 0.\n\nIn Example 0's input:\n[0, 0, 0]\n[0, 2, 0]\n[2, 4, 2]\n\nThe output is:\n[4, 0, 4]\n[0, 2, 0]\n[2, 4, 2]\n\nHmm, the middle row stays the same. The bottom row also seems the same. The top row changed from all zeros to 4, 0, 4. Wait, how? Let me check the numbers. The bottom row in input is 2,4,2. Maybe the top row is taking the sum of the numbers below? Let's see. The bottom row's first element is 2, and the middle of the next row (second row) is 2. If we add 2 (from row 3, column 1) and 2 (from row 2, column 2), maybe that's 4. Then the first element in the top row becomes 4. Similarly, the third element is 2 from row 3, column 3 plus 2 from row 2, column 2. Wait, but row 3, column 3 is 2, and row 2, column 2 is 2. Adding them gives 4, so top row becomes 4, 0,4. The middle element in the top row is 0. Maybe it's some kind of diagonal addition?\n\nWait, maybe it's looking at the cells below and diagonally. For each cell in the top row, maybe it's the sum of the cell directly below and the cells diagonally below-left and below-right. Let me check. For example, in Example 0, the top left cell (0,0) in the input is 0. In the output, it's 4. Let's see what's below it. The cell below is row 1, column 0 (0), and the cells diagonally below-left and right. But row 1, column 0 is 0. The next row (row 2) has cell (2,0) which is 2. So maybe adding those? Or maybe it's taking the sum of the cells directly below in the next two layers.\n\nWait, let's look at another example. Take Example 1. The input's bottom two rows are:\n[0, 0, 8, 0, 0]\n[8, 8, 3, 8, 8]\n\nThe output's third row from top is [0,3,0,3,0]. Hmm. The output's second row is [3,0,0,0,3]. The third row in output is [0,3,0,3,0]. How does that relate to the input? Let's see the input's bottom two rows. The fifth row (bottom) is 8,8,3,8,8. The fourth row is 0,0,8,0,0. So maybe the output is placing some numbers in the upper rows based on the numbers in the lower rows.\n\nIn Example 1's output, the second row (third from bottom) has 3s at the first and last positions. The third row from top has 3s in the second and fourth positions. Maybe there's a pattern where each non-zero number in the lower rows causes a number to propagate upwards in a certain way.\n\nWait, another approach: perhaps the output is created by moving certain numbers upwards in a diagonal fashion. For instance, in Example 0, the bottom row has 2,4,2. The middle row has 2. The top row's 4s might come from the sum of the 2 in the middle and the 2s on the bottom's ends. But how?\n\nAlternatively, looking at the numbers in the input's lower rows, maybe the output layers above are filled with values that are from the lower layers, but shifted upwards and outwards. Like, for each non-zero cell in the lower rows, when you move up a layer, you place a value that's the same as the cell below it, but in positions to the left and right. Let's check.\n\nIn Example 0's input, the third row (bottom) is [2,4,2]. The second row is [0,2,0]. The output's top row is [4,0,4]. The 4s might be the sum of the 2 from the middle of the second row and the 2 from the ends of the third row. 2 + 2 =4. Then, in the top row, the first and third positions are 4. The middle is 0.\n\nLooking at Example 1's input: the bottom row has 8,8,3,8,8. The fourth row (just above) has 0,0,8,0,0. The output's fourth row (from top) is [0,0,8,0,0], same as input. Then the third row (from bottom) in output has [0,3,0,3,0]. The numbers 3 here could be from the 3 in the bottom row's middle. How?\n\nWait, in the bottom row, the middle is 3. In the output's third row (from bottom), there's 3s in positions 1 and 3 (assuming 0-based). Then in the second row (from bottom) of the output, there are 3s in positions 0 and 4. So perhaps each non-zero number in a lower row propagates upwards diagonally. For example, the 3 in the bottom's center (position 2) would, in the row above, split into two 3s at positions 1 and 3. Then, in the row above that, each of those 3s would split again into positions 0 and 4. So each step up, the positions spread outwards by one each direction.\n\nSimilarly, in Example 0: the middle of the second row is 2. The bottom row's ends are 2. In the output's top row, the ends are 4 (2+2). Wait, maybe the top row's numbers are the sum of the numbers diagonally below. For example, for the top left cell, you look at the cell directly below (which is 0 in the input's second row first column) and then the cells diagonally below-left and right. But in the third row, first column is 2. Wait, maybe it's the sum of the cells that are two layers below. Like in Example 0, the top row's first element is 4. The cells two layers below are the third row's first element (2) and the second row's middle (2). But 2+2=4. That seems to fit. Let's check.\n\nIn Example 0, top left is 4: third row (row 2) has 2, second row (row 1) has 0. Wait, no. Wait, maybe the sum is from the two layers below. For row 0, column 0: look at row 1, column 0 (0) and row 2, column 0 (2). But 0 + 2 =2, not 4. Hmm, that doesn't add up. Alternatively, maybe it's the sum of the two cells directly below in the next two rows. Wait, maybe for the top row, each cell is the sum of the two cells below it in the same column. Let's see. In Example 0, first row (row 0) first column (0) is 4. The cells below in row 1, column 0 (0) and row 2, column 0 (2). 0+2=2, which doesn't match 4. So that's not it.\n\nWait, maybe the pattern is that each non-zero number in the lower rows propagates upwards in a diamond or pyramid shape. For example, a number in a lower row causes numbers to be placed in the rows above, each time branching outwards. For instance, in Example 1, the 3 in the bottom row's center (row 4, column 2) would cause a 3 in row 3, columns 1 and 3. Then in row 2, columns 0 and 4. Then row 1, columns 0 and 4 again? Wait, in Example 1's output, row 1 (second row from top) has 3s at columns 0 and 4. Then row 2 (third row) has 3s at columns 1 and 3. Row 3 (fourth row) has 8 in column 2, same as input. So maybe each non-zero number in a lower row creates a \"V\" shape above it, expanding by one each side per row.\n\nAnother angle: look at the layers. The output seems to add numbers above certain non-zero elements in the lower rows, creating a kind of reflection or mirror. For example, in Example 1's output, the 3 in the bottom center leads to 3s appearing in the rows above, each time moving outwards. So for each non-zero element in the lower rows, you place copies of that number in the rows above, each time moving left and right by one position, until you reach the top or until another number is encountered.\n\nLet me see Example 2. Input's bottom two rows are [0,6,6,6,0] and [6,1,1,1,6]. The output has in the third row from top (row 2) [1,0,0,0,1]. Then row 3 (from top) is [0,6,6,6,0], same as input. The 1s in row 2's ends might come from the 1s in the bottom row. Let's see: the bottom row has 1s in positions 1,2,3. Wait, but the output's row 2 has 1s at positions 0 and 4. How does that happen? The bottom row is 6,1,1,1,6. So the 1s are in columns 1,2,3. Then, maybe each 1 in the bottom row propagates upwards diagonally. But in the row above (row 4 in input), which is [0,6,6,6,0], but output's row 3 is same as input. Then in row 2 (output) it's [1,0,0,0,1]. So the 1s are at the ends. How?\n\nAlternatively, the 1s in the bottom row (positions 1,2,3) might each generate a 1 in the row above, but shifted left and right. But for the middle 1 (position 2), it would go to positions 1 and 3 in row 4. But row 4 in input is 0,6,6,6,0. So perhaps if there's a non-zero number already in that position, it's not replaced. Wait, but in the output of Example 2, row 3 (input row 4) is same as input. So perhaps the propagation only happens in the rows above the original. So for each non-zero number, starting from the bottom, you look up each row and place the number in the positions left and right, but if those positions are zero. But maybe only certain numbers are propagated, or the propagation depends on the layer.\n\nAlternatively, the pattern might involve taking the minimum value from the lower two rows and propagating that upwards. Let's see. In Example 0, the bottom row has 2,4,2. The second row (middle) has 0,2,0. The output's top row is 4,0,4. Maybe it's adding the numbers from the middle row's 2 and the bottom row's 2s. 2 +2=4. So the top row's ends are 4. But why the middle is 0? Because the middle of the middle row is 2, but the bottom's middle is 4. Maybe that's not part of the sum.\n\nAnother thought: maybe the numbers in the upper rows are derived from the sum of the two numbers diagonally below them. For example, in Example 0's top row, the first element is 4. The elements diagonally below it would be the middle row's element (row 1, column 0, which is 0) and the bottom row's element (row 2, column 1, which is 4). Wait, that doesn't add up. 0+4=4. So maybe. But the third element in the top row would be 0 (row1, column2) +4 (row2, column1) =4. But then the middle element would be 2 (row1, column1) +4 (row2, column1) =6. But the output's middle is 0, so that doesn't fit. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each upper cell is the sum of the cell directly below and the two cells diagonally below. For example, in Example 0's top row, first element: sum of row1, column0 (0) + row2, column0 (2) + row2, column1 (4). 0+2+4=6. No, the output is 4. So that doesn't add up.\n\nWait, maybe the pattern is that for each cell in the output, it's the sum of the cells two layers below. For example, in Example 0, the top row's cells are the sum of the cells two rows below. The top row (row 0) would look at row 2. So row 0, column0: 2, column1:4, column2:2. But in the output, row0 is [4,0,4]. So that's not directly sum. But maybe there's another step.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is generated by mirroring the lower rows in some way. For example, the top row in Example 0 is a mirror of the bottom row. 2,4,2 becomes 4,0,4. Wait, maybe each element is doubled. 2*2=4. But why the middle is 0. Hmm, no.\n\nLooking at Example 3's input and output. The input's bottom two rows are:\n[0,0,2,2,2,0,0]\n[2,2,4,4,4,2,2]\n\nThe output's fifth row (from top) is [0,0,2,2,2,0,0], same as input. The fourth row (from top) is [0,4,0,0,0,4,0], and the third row is [4,0,0,0,0,0,4]. So the 4s are appearing in the upper rows, moving outwards each time. The bottom row has 4s in the middle. So maybe each 4 in the bottom row (positions 2,3,4) is causing 4s to appear in the rows above, spreading outward.\n\nWait, in Example 3's output, row 3 (from top) has 4s at the ends. Row 4 (from top) has 4s at positions 1 and 5. Row 5 is same as input. So the 4s are moving outward by one each row. So the 4s in the bottom row (positions 2,3,4) perhaps each contribute to placing 4s one position left and right in the row above. But since there are three 4s in the bottom row, maybe their contributions overlap. For example, in row 5 (output) the 2s are in positions 2,3,4. Then in row 4 (output), the 4s are at positions 1 and 5. That's two positions. Then in row 3, the 4s are at 0 and 6. So each time, moving outward by one. But how do the numbers from the lower rows influence this?\n\nAlternatively, each non-zero number in the lower rows causes a number to be placed in the upper rows, moving diagonally upwards and outwards. For instance, a number in position (row r, column c) would place the same number in (r-1, c-1) and (r-1, c+1), then those would place numbers in (r-2, c-2) and (r-2, c+2), and so on. But this would create a diamond shape. However, in the examples, sometimes the numbers are different. For example, in Example 1, the output has 3s in upper rows, which come from the 3 in the bottom row.\n\nIn Example 1's input, the bottom row has a 3 at column 2. The row above has an 8 at column 2. In the output, the third row from the bottom (row 2) has 3s at columns 1 and 3. Then the row above (row 1) has 3s at columns 0 and 4. So the 3 in the bottom propagates up, each time moving left and right by one, but only where the upper cell is zero. Because in row 3 (input) column 2 is 8, which is non-zero, so the 3 from below doesn't overwrite it. Hence, the 3s appear in the rows above that.\n\nSo the pattern seems to be: for each non-zero number in the input grid, starting from the bottom row and moving upward, each number propagates upwards by placing copies of itself in the cells diagonally left and right in the row above. However, this propagation only occurs if the target cell in the upper row is zero. Also, if multiple numbers propagate into the same cell, perhaps their values are summed. Wait, but in Example 0's top row, the output is 4, which could be the sum of two 2s from the lower rows.\n\nWait, Example 0's bottom row is [2,4,2], and the row above (second row) is [0,2,0]. The output's top row is [4,0,4]. Let's see: the 2 in the bottom row's first column (2,0) would propagate to (1, -1) which is invalid, and (1,1). The row above that (row 1) has a 2 in column 1. Then, that 2 would propagate to row 0, columns 0 and 2. So in row 0, columns 0 and 2 get 2 each. Summing them would give 4. But why are they summed instead of overwriting? Because in row 0, column 0 is 0, so the 2 from the left propagation (from row 1, column 1's left) and another 2 from the right propagation of the bottom row's column 0's 2. Wait, perhaps each number in a lower row can influence multiple cells above, and their contributions add up.\n\nWait, maybe the steps are:\n\n1. Start from the bottom row and move upwards row by row.\n2. For each cell in the current row that is non-zero, add its value to the cells diagonally left and right in the row above.\n3. If the cell above is already non-zero (from the original input), it remains as is.\n\nBut how does this work with the examples?\n\nTake Example 0:\n\nOriginal input:\nRow 2 (bottom): [2,4,2]\nRow 1: [0,2,0]\nRow 0: [0,0,0]\n\nProcessing from bottom up.\n\nStart with row 2. Each non-zero cell (2,4,2) will add their values to the row above (row 1) diagonally left and right.\n\nSo cell (2,0) has 2. It adds 2 to row 1, columns -1 (invalid) and 1. So only column 1 in row 1 gets 2. But row 1 already has a 2 in column 1, which might be from the original input. Wait, the original row 1 is [0,2,0]. So the 2 in row 1's column 1 is part of the input. Then, when processing row 2, adding the 2s would modify row 1? But in the output, row 1 is still [0,2,0]. So maybe the propagation only affects the rows above the current row being processed. Wait, maybe the process is:\n\nFor each row from the bottom up:\n\n- For each cell in the current row:\n\n   - If the cell has a non-zero value, add that value to the cells in the row above, diagonally left and right.\n\nBut this would accumulate the values in the upper rows.\n\nBut in Example 0, the output's row 0 has 4,0,4. Let's see:\n\nProcessing row 2 (bottom):\n\nEach non-zero cell (2,4,2) will add their values to the row above (row 1) at columns c-1 and c+1.\n\n- Cell (2,0) with 2: adds 2 to row 1, columns -1 (invalid) and 1. So row1, column1 gets +2. But row1, column1 was 2 originally, so now it's 4? But in the output, row1 is [0,2,0]. So that's conflicting.\n\nWait, perhaps the propagation is not additive, but places the value in the upper cells if they are zero. So for Example 0, when processing row2, the cell (2,0) with 2 would try to place 2 in row1, columns -1 (invalid) and 1. Since row1, column1 is already 2 (from the input), it's not changed. Then, processing row1, the cell (1,1) with 2 would propagate to row0, columns 0 and 2. So row0, columns 0 and 2 get 2 each. Hence, row0 becomes [2,0,2]. But in the output, it's [4,0,4]. So this doesn't match.\n\nHmm, maybe there's another layer. Maybe each cell propagates its value twice, or the value is multiplied by the distance or something.\n\nAlternatively, the propagation could be that each non-zero cell's value is added to the upper cells, and this is done for each layer upwards. So, for example, processing row2 (bottom) first, then row1, then row0.\n\nIn Example 0:\n\nProcessing row2:\n\nEach cell in row2: 2,4,2.\n\nFor each cell, add their value to the diagonally upper left and right cells in row1.\n\n- Cell (2,0) 2: add 2 to row1, columns -1 (invalid) and 1. So row1, column1 +=2. Original row1 is [0,2,0], so column1 becomes 4.\n\n- Cell (2,1) 4: add 4 to row1, columns 0 and 2. So row1, column0 +=4 and column2 +=4. Now row1 becomes [4,4,4].\n\n- Cell (2,2) 2: add 2 to row1, columns 1 and 3 (invalid). So row1, column1 +=2. Now row1 is [4,6,4].\n\nBut in the output, row1 is still [0,2,0]. So this approach must be wrong.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the propagation only happens if the upper cells are zero. So in Example 0's row2:\n\nCell (2,0) 2: try to add to row1, column -1 (invalid) and 1. row1, column1 is 2 (non-zero), so nothing changes.\n\nCell (2,1) 4: try to add to row1, columns 0 and 2. row1, columns0 and 2 are 0, so they become 4 each. Now row1 becomes [4,2,4].\n\nCell (2,2) 2: same as cell (2,0). Nothing changes.\n\nThen processing row1. Now row1 is [4,2,4]. Each cell here will propagate to row0.\n\nCell (1,0) 4: adds 4 to row0, columns -1 (invalid) and 1. So row0, column1 becomes 4.\n\nCell (1,1) 2: adds 2 to row0, columns 0 and 2. So row0 becomes [2,4,2].\n\nCell (1,2) 4: adds 4 to row0, columns1 and 3 (invalid). So row0, column1 becomes 4+4=8.\n\nBut the output's row0 is [4,0,4]. So this approach is not matching.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Maybe there's a different approach. Let's look at the output and see how the numbers in the upper rows relate to the lower ones.\n\nIn Example 0's output, the top row has 4s. The middle row is the same as input. The bottom row is same. The 4s in the top could be the sum of the 2 from the middle row and the 2 from the bottom row's ends. For example, 2 (middle row's center) plus 2 (bottom row's left end) gives 4 in the top left. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe each non-zero cell in the input has a certain 'height' and the output is building a pyramid-like structure upwards. For instance, a cell with value v in row r will have v in the row above at positions c-1 and c+1, but only if those positions are zero.\n\nBut in Example 1's output, the 3 in the bottom row's center leads to 3s in the row above (positions 1 and 3), then in the next row above (positions 0 and 4). So it's like the 3 is spreading outwards each row. Similarly, in Example 3, the 4s in the bottom row's middle columns lead to 4s moving outwards each row.\n\nSo the pattern seems to be:\n\nFor each non-zero number in the input grid, starting from the bottom row and moving upwards, each number propagates upwards and outwards, placing itself in the cells diagonally left and right in the row above, provided those cells are zero. This creates a V-shape or pyramid effect.\n\nAdditionally, if multiple numbers are propagating into the same cell, their values are summed. Wait, in Example 0's top row, the 4s could be the sum of two 2s. For instance, the top left 4 comes from the 2 in the middle row (row1, column1) propagating left to row0, column0, and the 2 in the bottom row (row2, column0) propagating up to row0, column0 via row1's processing.\n\nBut how?\n\nLet me try to step through Example 0 again.\n\nInput rows:\n\nRow0: [0,0,0]\n\nRow1: [0,2,0]\n\nRow2: [2,4,2]\n\nProcessing starts from the bottom (row2) and moves up.\n\nProcessing row2:\n\nEach cell in row2: 2,4,2.\n\nFor each non-zero cell, we place copies diagonally left and right in row1, but only if those cells in row1 are zero.\n\nRow1's original state is [0,2,0].\n\nProcessing cell (2,0) with 2:\n\nDiagonally left is row1, column -1 (invalid), right is row1, column1. Row1, column1 is 2 (non-zero), so no change.\n\nProcessing cell (2,1) with 4:\n\nDiagonally left is row1, column0, and right is row1, column2. Both are 0. So set them to 4. Now row1 becomes [4,2,4].\n\nProcessing cell (2,2) with 2:\n\nDiagonally left is row1, column1 (2, non-zero), and right is invalid. No change.\n\nSo after processing row2, row1 becomes [4,2,4].\n\nNow process row1 (newly modified):\n\nRow1: [4,2,4].\n\nEach non-zero cell here will propagate to row0.\n\nProcessing cell (1,0) with 4:\n\nDiagonally left (invalid) and right (column1). Row0, column1 is 0. So set to 4. Now row0 becomes [0,4,0].\n\nProcessing cell (1,1) with 2:\n\nDiagonally left (column0) and right (column2). Both are 0. Set them to 2. Now row0 becomes [2,4,2].\n\nProcessing cell (1,2) with 4:\n\nDiagonally left (column1, which is 4 now) and right (invalid). So set column1 in row0 to 4 (but it's already 4). No change.\n\nSo row0 becomes [2,4,2]. But the output is [4,0,4]. So this doesn't match.\n\nThis approach isn't working. Maybe the direction of processing is different. What if we process from the top down instead of bottom up? No, but the examples seem to have the propagated numbers appearing above the original.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each layer propagates upwards but only once. For example, each number can only propagate once, and only from its original position. So, for Example 0, the original row1's 2 (column1) propagates to row0's columns0 and 2. And the original row2's 2s (columns0 and 2) propagate to row1's columns1 (but row1's column1 is already 2, so no change), and row2's middle 4 propagates to row1's columns0 and 2. So row1's columns0 and 2 get 4. So row1 becomes [4,2,4]. Then row0's columns0 and 2 are set to 2 (from row1's 2) and 4 (from row1's 4). But this is getting too speculative.\n\nAnother approach: look at the test input and see what the expected output would be based on the pattern, and then see if that helps.\n\nTest Input:\n\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0] (row0)\n\n...\n\n[0,0,0,8,8,8,0,0,0] (row7)\n\n[8,8,8,2,2,2,8,8,8] (row8)\n\nLooking at the bottom two rows:\n\nRow8: 8,8,8,2,2,2,8,8,8\n\nRow7: 0,0,0,8,8,8,0,0,0\n\nIn the output, according to the pattern observed in training examples, the non-zero numbers in row8 and row7 should propagate upwards. For example, the 8s in row7's columns3,4,5 (8,8,8) and the 2s in row8's columns3,4,5 (2,2,2) would propagate upwards.\n\nFollowing the pattern from earlier examples, each non-zero number would create a V-shape above it. For example, the 2s in row8, columns3-5 would each propagate upwards. Let's think about how this would look.\n\nEach 2 in row8 would propagate to row7's columns2 and 4 (for column3), 3 and 5 (column4), etc. But row7 already has 8s in those positions, so they wouldn't be replaced. Then, row7's 8s would propagate upwards to row6's columns2-6 (if each 8 in row7's column3,4,5 propagates to columns2 and 4, 3 and 5, 4 and 6, respectively). But this might create overlapping.\n\nAlternatively, for each 8 in row7's columns3,4,5 (positions 3-5), they would propagate to row6's columns2 and 4, 3 and 5, 4 and 6. But since these positions in row6 are 0, they would be set to 8.\n\nSimilarly, the 8s in row8's columns0-2 and 6-8 would propagate upwards. For example, the 8 in row8, column0 would propagate to row7's columns -1 (invalid) and 1. So row7's column1 would get 8. But row7's column1 is 0. So it would set to 8. But the test input's row7 is [0,0,0,8,8,8,0,0,0]. So after processing row8, row7's column1 would get 8 from row8's column0, column1 would get 8 from row8's column0 and column2. Wait, this is getting complicated.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that the output for a given row is formed by taking the sum of the two cells directly below it. But again, not sure.\n\nGiven the time I'm spending and the complexity, perhaps I should look for a pattern in the training examples where the output's upper rows have elements that are the sum of the elements diagonally below them, two layers down.\n\nFor example, in Example 0:\n\nRow0's elements are sum of row2's elements diagonally two below. For row0, column0: row2, column0 (2) plus row1, column1 (2) =4.\n\nSimilarly, row0, column2: 2 +2=4. Middle is 0.\n\nIn Example 1:\n\nThe output's row1 (second from top) has 3s at 0 and 4. These could be sum of row3 (which is the fourth row from top, which in input is [0,0,8,0,0], but output's row3 is same as input. So perhaps row3's 8 is not contributing. Alternatively, the 3s in row1 could be from row4's middle 3 in the input. If row4's 3 is two layers below row1, then row1's columns0 and 4 would be 3. But how?\n\nThis seems plausible. Let's test this hypothesis.\n\nThe rule: For each cell in row i, the value is the sum of the cells in row i+2 that are in the same column and the adjacent columns (i+1, j-1) and (i+1, j+1). Or perhaps it's sum of the cells diagonally two layers below.\n\nBut in Example 0:\n\nRow0, column0: sum of row2, column0 (2) and row1, column1 (2) =4.\n\nYes, that's 2+2=4.\n\nRow0, column1: sum of row2, column1 (4) and row1's column0 and 2 (0+0)=0? But output is 0. So that fits.\n\nRow0, column2: same as column0.\n\nIn Example 1's output:\n\nRow1 (second row from top) has 3s at columns0 and 4.\n\nLooking at row3 (two rows below) which is [0,0,8,0,0] in input. But in output, row3 is same. Then, the sum for row1's columns0: row3's columns0 (0) + row2's column1 (0) =0. But the output is 3. So this hypothesis doesn't hold.\n\nAnother approach: for each cell in the output, it's the sum of the cells diagonally below-left and below-right, two rows down. For example, row i, j = row i+2, j-1 + row i+2, j+1.\n\nIn Example 0:\n\nRow0, column0: row2, column-1 (invalid) + row2, column1 (4) \u2192 4. But output is4. But how about row0, column0: row2, column0 (2) and row1, column1 (2) sum to 4. That matches.\n\nBut in Example 1, row1, column0: sum of row3, column-1 (invalid) and row3, column1 (0). But output is 3.\n\nThis doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, the pattern might be that each upper cell is the sum of the two cells directly below two layers. For example, row i, j = sum of row i+1, j-1 and row i+1, j+1.\n\nIn Example 0:\n\nRow0, column0: sum of row1, -1 (invalid) and row1, 1 (2) \u21922. Doesn't match output 4.\n\nHmm.\n\nI'm getting stuck. Let's try another approach. Look for the number of layers that are modified. In Example 0, the top row is modified. In Example1, the top three rows are modified. Example2: top two. Example3: top three. The number of modified layers seems to depend on the structure below.\n\nIn each example, the output has a certain number of upper rows modified, with values that seem to mirror or pyramid from the lower non-zero rows.\n\nIn the test input, the bottom two rows have:\n\nRow8: [8,8,8,2,2,2,8,8,8]\n\nRow7: [0,0,0,8,8,8,0,0,0]\n\nSo the non-zero elements are in row8's columns0-2,3-5 (values 8 and 2), and row7's columns3-5 (8).\n\nFollowing the pattern from examples, the 8s and 2s would propagate upwards.\n\nFor example, the 2s in row8's columns3-5 would each propagate upwards. Each 2 would cause a 2 to appear in row7's columns2 and4,3 and5,4 and6. But row7's columns3-5 are already 8, so those positions wouldn't change. Then row7's columns2 and6 would get 2s from the 2s in row8's columns3 and5. But since row7's columns2 and6 are 0, they would be set to 2. Then, in row6, those 2s (if any) would propagate further up.\n\nBut according to the examples, the propagation moves upwards and outwards. For example, the 8s in row7's columns3-5 would propagate to row6's columns2 and4,3 and5,4 and6. Since row6 is all zeros, those positions would be set to 8. Then row5 would have 8s in columns1 and5, etc.\n\nSimilarly, the 8s in row8's columns0-2 and6-8 would propagate upwards. For example, row8's column0 8 would propagate to row7's column1. Since row7's column1 is 0, it would be set to 8. Then in row6, column0 would be set to 8 from row7's column1.\n\nBut this is getting complicated. Let's think about what the expected output would be.\n\nIn the test input, the bottom two rows are:\n\nRow8: 8,8,8,2,2,2,8,8,8\n\nRow7: 0,0,0,8,8,8,0,0,0\n\nThe output would have these two rows as they are (since in the examples, the bottom rows remain unchanged). Then, the rows above them would have propagated values.\n\nStarting from row8, each 8 would propagate upwards. For each 8 in row8, columns0-2 and6-8:\n\n- For column0: propagates to row7, columns -1 (invalid) and 1. So row7's column1 would get 8.\n\n- Column1: propagates to row7, columns0 and2. So row7's columns0 and2 would get8.\n\n- Column2: propagates to row7, columns1 and3. So row7's column3 is already 8, so no change.\n\nSimilarly for columns6-8:\n\n- Column6: propagates to row7, columns5 and7. Column5 in row7 is 8, so no change. Column7 is 0, so set to8.\n\n- Column7: propagates to row7, columns6 and8. Column6 is 0, set to8. Column8 is 8.\n\n- Column8: propagates to row7, columns7 (already 0 ->8) and9 (invalid).\n\nBut row7 in the input is [0,0,0,8,8,8,0,0,0]. So after processing row8's propagation, row7 would have:\n\nColumns0:8 (from row8's column1)\n\nColumn1:8 (from row8's column0 and column2)\n\nColumn2:8 (from row8's column1 and column3, but column3 is 8 in row8's case)\n\nWait, perhaps this is not the right approach. Let's think about the examples again.\n\nIn Example3's test input, the bottom two rows have 2s and 4s, and the output has 4s propagating upwards. Each 4 in the bottom row leads to 4s in the rows above, spread outwards each time.\n\nSimilarly, in the test case, the 2s in row8's columns3-5 would propagate upwards. Each 2 would create a V-shape above. Let's see.\n\nFor row8's column3 (2), it would propagate to row7's columns2 and4. But row7's columns2 is 0, column4 is8. So row7's column2 would get 2. But row7's column4 is already 8, so no change.\n\nSimilarly, row8's column4 (2) would propagate to row7's columns3 and5, which are already 8. So no change.\n\nRow8's column5 (2) would propagate to row7's columns4 and6. Column4 is8, column6 is0. So column6 gets 2.\n\nSo after processing row8's 2s, row7 would have:\n\nColumns2:2, column6:2.\n\nBut row7 in the input is [0,0,0,8,8,8,0,0,0]. So after processing row8's 2s, row7 becomes [0,0,2,8,8,8,2,0,0].\n\nThen, processing row7's non-zero cells. The original 8s in columns3-5, and the new 2s in columns2 and6.\n\nProcessing row7's column2 (2):\n\nPropagate to row6's columns1 and3. Both are 0, so set to2.\n\nRow7's column3 (8) propagates to row6's columns2 and4. Those are 0, so set to8.\n\nRow7's column4 (8) propagates to row6's columns3 and5. Set to8.\n\nRow7's column5 (8) propagates to row6's columns4 and6. Set to8.\n\nRow7's column6 (2) propagates to row6's columns5 and7. Set to2.\n\nSo row6 would become:\n\n[0,2,8,8,8,2,0,0,0]\n\nProcessing row6's non-zero cells:\n\n- Column1 (2): propagate to row5's columns0 and2.\n\n- Column2 (8): propagate to row5's columns1 and3.\n\n- Column3 (8): propagate to row5's columns2 and4.\n\n- Column4 (8): propagate to row5's columns3 and5.\n\n- Column5 (2): propagate to row5's columns4 and6.\n\n- Column6 (0): no action.\n\nSo row5's:\n\nColumns0: 2 (from row6's column1)\n\nColumns2:8 (from row6's column2)\n\nColumns4:8 (from row6's column4)\n\nColumns6:2 (from row6's column5)\n\nBut need to see how this layers up.\n\nThis is getting too time-consuming. Given the examples, perhaps the pattern is that for each non-zero cell, you place a copy of its value in the cells diagonally left and right, two rows above. For example, a cell at (row, col) places its value in (row-2, col-1) and (row-2, col+1). This would create a diamond pattern.\n\nIn Example0:\n\nThe bottom row (row2) has 2,4,2. So for each cell here:\n\n- (2,0) 2: place in (0, -1) invalid and (0, 1). So row0, column1 gets 2. But output row0 has 4. So not matching.\n\nAlternatively, if each cell contributes to two rows above. For example, a cell at row r contributes to row r-2, columns c-1 and c+1. Then in Example0's row2, column0 (2) contributes to row0, columns-1 (invalid) and1. So row0, column1 gets 2. Similarly, row2, column2 (2) contributes to row0, columns1 and3 (invalid). So row0, column1 gets 2+2=4. Middle column0, column1 becomes4. But output row0 has [4,0,4]. So the middle is 0.\n\nThis doesn't align. Hmm.\n\nAt this point, considering time constraints, I'll try to find the pattern based on the examples and apply it to the test input.\n\nThe pattern seems to be that each non-zero number in the lower rows generates copies of itself in the upper rows, moving diagonally outward by one position per row. For example, a number in row r, column c will have copies in row r-1, c-1 and c+1, then in row r-2, c-2 and c+2, and so on, until they hit the edges or a non-zero cell. The numbers in the output's upper rows are the sum of all such propagated values.\n\nIn Example0, the bottom row's 2s (positions 0 and 2) and the middle row's 2 (position1) propagate upwards. The bottom row's 2s propagate to the middle row's positions1 (but already 2), and then the middle row's 2 propagates to the top row's positions0 and 2. So each top position receives 2 (from middle row) +2 (from left bottom row) +2 (from right bottom row) =6. But output is4. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the propagated values are the same as the original, but only one layer up. For example, the bottom row's 2s propagate to the row above's left and right, and then those propagate further up.\n\nIn the test input, the bottom row has 8s and 2s. The 8s in columns0-2 and6-8 would propagate upwards. Each 8 in column0 would propagate to row7's column1. Each 8 in column1 to row7's columns0 and2, and so on. But row7 has 8s in columns3-5. The 2s in row8's columns3-5 would propagate to row7's columns2 and4,3 and5,4 and6. But row7's columns3-5 are 8s, so only columns2 and6 get 2s.\n\nThen, row7's new 8s (from row8's 8s) and the existing 8s, along with the new 2s, would propagate to row6. For example, the 8s in row7's columns0-2 (if set from row8's propagation) would propagate to row6's columns-1 and1, etc., but this is getting too involved.\n\nBased on the training examples, the output seems to build a pyramid-like structure above non-zero elements, with the values spreading outwards. For the test input, the bottom row's 2s and 8s would create such structures.\n\nIn the test input's bottom row (row8), the 8s are on the edges and the 2s are in the middle. Row7 has 8s in the middle. So the output would have the 8s propagating upwards from row7 and row8, and the 2s from row8.\n\nFor example, row7's 8s (columns3-5) would propagate to row6's columns2-6 (each 8 in row7's column3 would propagate to row6's columns2 and4, but row6 is zero, so those positions would get 8. Similarly, column4's 8 would propagate to 3 and5, and column5's 8 would propagate to4 and6. So row6 would have 8s in columns2,3,4,5,6. Then row5 would have 8s in columns1-7, but that seems too broad. But according to Example3, which has a similar structure, the propagation is more sparse.\n\nAlternatively, each 8 in row7's columns3-5 would propagate to row6's columns2,4,3,5,4,6. But since row6 is initially zero, each propagation would add 8 to those positions. But since they are added multiple times, perhaps the sum is considered. But Example3's output shows 4s, which were sums of lower numbers.\n\nAlternatively, the test output's upper rows would have 2s and 8s propagating upwards. For example, the 2s in row8's columns3-5 would propagate to row7's columns2 and4, 3 and5,4 and6. But since row7's columns3-5 are 8s, only columns2 and6 get 2s. Then, in row6, those 2s would propagate to columns1 and3, 5 and7. Then in row5, columns0 and2,4 and6, etc. Similarly, the 8s in row8's columns0-2 and6-8 would propagate to row7's columns1,0,2 (from columns0-2) and columns5,6,7 (from columns6-8). Then, those in row7 would propagate further up.\n\nThis would create a pattern where the 8s and 2s create separate pyramids.\n\nPutting this all together, the test output's upper rows would have layers of 8s and 2s spreading outwards.\n\nBased on the training examples, the pattern seems to be that each non-zero number propagates upwards in a diamond shape, two cells per row, and the output is built by aggregating these propagations. For the test input, the output would have:\n\n- The bottom two rows unchanged.\n\n- The row above (row7) modified to have 8s in columns3-5, and 2s in columns2 and6.\n\n- Then row6 would have 8s in columns2,4,6 from row7's 8s, and 2s in columns1,3,5,7 from row7's 2s.\n\n- This would continue upwards with each layer spreading outwards.\n\nBut without a clear formula, it's challenging. Given the examples, perhaps the output for the test case is as follows:\n\nThe rows would have 2s and 8s propagating upwards in a diamond pattern. For example, the 2s in the bottom row's middle would create a diamond of 2s moving up, and the 8s would create larger diamonds.\n\nThe final answer would have layers of 2s and 8s in the upper rows, mirroring the pattern from the training examples."
