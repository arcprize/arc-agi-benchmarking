        "cot_1": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. So, looking at the training examples, I need to see how the input matrices are transformed into the output matrices. Let's go through each example one by one.\n\nStarting with Example 0. The input is three rows:\n\n[0, 2, 2]\n[0, 2, 2]\n[2, 0, 0]\n\nThe output changes the last row from [2,0,0] to [1,0,0]. So only the first element of the third row changed from 2 to 1. Hmm, why that one?\n\nLooking at Example 1. The input is a 4x4 matrix. The output changes some elements to 1. For instance, in the third row, the last element becomes 1. In the fourth row, the second element becomes 1. Maybe there's a pattern related to the position of 2s and 0s around them.\n\nIn Example 2, the third row's last element changes from 2 to 1. The other rows remain the same. The rows that have changes are ones where a 2 is at the end, but maybe only if certain conditions are met in adjacent cells.\n\nExample 3's input is a 3x3 matrix. The output changes the middle element of the second row to 1 and the middle element of the third row to 1. Let's see the original elements: the second row was [2,0,2], and the output is [2,0,1]. The third row was [0,2,0], which becomes [0,1,0]. So in both cases, a 2 was replaced by 1. But why those particular positions?\n\nLooking for a common pattern. Maybe it's about cells that have exactly one adjacent 2. Or perhaps cells where a 2 is adjacent to a 0. Let me check the positions where 2s are turned into 1s.\n\nIn Example 0, the third row's first element was 2. The surrounding elements: above it is 0 (from the second row's first element). Below it, nothing since it's the last row. So maybe if a 2 is adjacent (vertically or horizontally) to a 0, and there's exactly one such occurrence, it turns into 1? Wait, but in Example 1, the third row's last element was 2. Let's see its neighbors. In the input of Example 1's third row [0,0,0,2], the last element 2 has neighbors to the left (0) and below (0 in the fourth row). So maybe when a 2 is at the edge and has only one neighbor (a 0), it becomes 1.\n\nWait, but in Example 3's second row [2,0,2], the rightmost 2 is changed to 1. The right neighbor is 0 (third row's element?), no, the third row is [0,2,0]. Wait, maybe considering horizontal and vertical neighbors. For the second row's rightmost 2 (position [1][2] in 0-based indexing), its right neighbor is nothing (since it's the end of the row), the left neighbor is 0. The elements above and below? The third row's same column is 2 (from input third row [0,2,0], so column 1 is 2). So that 2 has a 0 to the left and a 2 below. Maybe the number of adjacent 0s? Or perhaps it's about being isolated in some way.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s that are in cells where exactly one adjacent cell (including diagonally?) is 0. But that seems a bit unclear.\n\nAnother approach: look for 2s that are adjacent to exactly one 0. Let's see:\n\nIn Example 0, the third row's first element is 2. Its adjacent cells are: above (0 from row 2), left (none, since it's the first element), right (0 in same row), and below (none). So adjacent cells are 0 (above) and 0 (right). Wait, but in that case, two 0s. So that might not fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 2s that are next to a 0 in a specific direction. Let's think of the outputs where 2s are changed to 1. In Example 0, the changed cell is [2][0] (third row, first element). Looking at the input matrix, the cell above it (row 2, column 0) is 0. So maybe if a 2 is directly below a 0, it becomes 1. But then let's check Example 1. The third row's last element (2) is in a cell where above is 0 (row 2, column 3 is 0?), wait the input for Example 1 is:\n\nInput rows:\n\nRow 0: [2,2,2,0]\n\nRow 1: [0,2,0,0]\n\nRow 2: [0,0,0,2]\n\nRow 3: [0,2,0,0]\n\nThe third row's last element is 2 (row 2, column 3). The cell above it is row 1, column 3: 0. So yes, same as Example 0. Then, in the output, it becomes 1. Similarly, in row 3, column 1 (the 2 in input's row 3, column 1 becomes 1). The cell above that is row 2, column 1: 0. So perhaps the rule is: any 2 that is directly below a 0 (i.e., in the same column, row below) will be replaced by 1.\n\nWait, in Example 0, the third row's first element is 2. The cell above (row 2, first element) is 0. So yes, so that 2 is replaced by 1. Let's check other examples.\n\nIn Example 3's input:\n\nRow 0: [2,2,0]\n\nRow 1: [2,0,2]\n\nRow 2: [0,2,0]\n\nThe output changes row 1's last element (2) to 1. The cell above that is row 0's last element, which is 0. So that's a 2 below a 0, so replaced by 1. Also, row 2's middle element (2) becomes 1. The cell above it is row 1's middle element, which is 0. So that's another case of 2 below 0. So this seems to fit.\n\nLet's check Example 2. The third row's last element is 2 in input. The cell above is row 2's last element in input, which was 2 (original input row 2 is [2,2,0,2], so the last element is 2. So the cell above is row 2's last element (2) and the element above that (row 1's last element is 0). Wait, perhaps the immediate above cell. For Example 2's third row (assuming the input is 5 rows?), wait the input for Example 2 is:\n\n[2, 2, 0, 0]\n\n[0, 2, 0, 0]\n\n[2, 2, 0, 2]\n\n[0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n[0, 2, 2, 2]\n\nSo the third row is [2,2,0,2]. The output changes the last element of the third row (2) to 1. The cell above it is row 2, column 3 (original input row 2's column 3 is 0). Wait, no. Wait, in Example 2's input, rows are:\n\nRow 0: [2,2,0,0]\n\nRow 1: [0,2,0,0]\n\nRow 2: [2,2,0,2]\n\nRow 3: [0,0,0,0]\n\nRow 4: [0,2,2,2]\n\nSo the third row is index 2 (if 0-based). Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let's count them:\n\nOriginal input of Example 2 is:\n\nRow 0: [2,2,0,0]\n\nRow 1: [0,2,0,0]\n\nRow 2: [2,2,0,2]\n\nRow 3: [0,0,0,0]\n\nRow 4: [0,2,2,2]\n\nSo the third row is index 2: [2,2,0,2]. The output for this row is [2,2,0,1], so the last element changes. The cell above row 2's last element (column 3) is row 1, column 3: which is 0. So that's a 0 above the 2, so the 2 is replaced by 1.\n\nAnother test: in Example 1's fourth row (row 3 in 0-based), the second element (2) is replaced by 1. The cell above it is row 2, column 1: 0. So yes, same pattern.\n\nSo the pattern seems to be: for each cell in the matrix, if the cell contains a 2 and the cell directly above it (same column, previous row) is a 0, then replace the 2 with a 1. All other cells remain the same.\n\nLet me verify this with all examples.\n\nIn Example 0:\n\nThird row, first column (value 2). The cell above is row 2 (since the input has three rows, rows 0,1,2?), wait in example 0's input:\n\nOriginal input:\n\nRow 0: [0,2,2]\n\nRow 1: [0,2,2]\n\nRow 2: [2,0,0]\n\nSo the third row is row 2. The cell above row 2, column 0 is row 1, column 0: 0. So yes, the 2 is replaced by 1.\n\nIn Example 3:\n\nRow 1's last element (2) is replaced by 1. The cell above it is row 0's column 2, which is 0. So correct.\n\nRow 2's middle element (2) is replaced by 1. The cell above is row 1's middle element (0). Correct.\n\nIn Example 2:\n\nRow 2's last element (2) has above cell row 1's column 3 (0). So replaced by 1.\n\nWhat about other cells? For example, in Example 1's row 0, all are 2s. The cells above them would be non-existent (since it's the first row), so no change.\n\nSo the rule seems to hold. Now applying this to the test input.\n\nTest input:\n\n[2, 2, 0, 2]\n\n[0, 2, 0, 0]\n\n[0, 0, 2, 0]\n\n[2, 0, 0, 0]\n\n[0, 0, 2, 2]\n\nSo let's process each row starting from row 1 (since row 0 has no rows above it). For each cell in a row, check if the cell above (previous row, same column) is 0. If so and the current cell is 2, replace with 1.\n\nLet's go step by step.\n\nRow 0: [2,2,0,2] \u2192 no changes since there's no row above.\n\nRow 1: [0,2,0,0]\n\nCheck each cell:\n\nCell (1,0): 0. Not a 2, no change.\n\nCell (1,1): 2. Check cell above (row 0, column 1): 2. So no change.\n\nCell (1,2): 0. No change.\n\nCell (1,3): 0. No change.\n\nSo row 1 remains the same.\n\nRow 2: [0,0,2,0]\n\nCheck each cell:\n\nCell (2,0): 0. No change.\n\nCell (2,1): 0. No change.\n\nCell (2,2): 2. Check cell above (row 1, column 2): 0. So this 2 should become 1.\n\nCell (2,3): 0. No change.\n\nSo row 2 becomes [0,0,1,0].\n\nRow 3: [2,0,0,0]\n\nCheck each cell:\n\nCell (3,0): 2. Check cell above (row 2, column 0): 0. So becomes 1.\n\nCell (3,1): 0. No change.\n\nCell (3,2): 0. No change.\n\nCell (3,3): 0. No change.\n\nSo row 3 becomes [1,0,0,0].\n\nRow 4: [0,0,2,2]\n\nCheck each cell:\n\nCell (4,0): 0. No change.\n\nCell (4,1): 0. No change.\n\nCell (4,2): 2. Check cell above (row 3, column 2): 0. So becomes 1.\n\nCell (4,3): 2. Check cell above (row 3, column 3): 0. So becomes 1.\n\nSo row 4 becomes [0,0,1,1].\n\nPutting it all together, the output matrix should be:\n\n[2, 2, 0, 2]\n\n[0, 2, 0, 0]\n\n[0, 0, 1, 0]\n\n[1, 0, 0, 0]\n\n[0, 0, 1, 1]\n\nLet me check if this matches the pattern. For each 2 that is below a 0 (in the same column), replace with 1. That's what we did here. So yes, this should be correct.",

        "cot_2": "Okay, let's see. I need to figure out the pattern from the training examples and apply it to the test input. Let me start by looking at the examples one by one.\n\nStarting with Example 0:\nInput:\n[0, 2, 2]\n[0, 2, 2]\n[2, 0, 0]\n\nOutput:\n[0, 2, 2]\n[0, 2, 2]\n[1, 0, 0]\n\nSo the third row changed from [2,0,0] to [1,0,0]. The only change is the first element from 2 to 1. Let me check the other rows. The first two rows didn't change. Hmm.\n\nExample 1:\nInput:\n[2,2,2,0]\n[0,2,0,0]\n[0,0,0,2]\n[0,2,0,0]\n\nOutput:\n[2,2,2,0]\n[0,2,0,0]\n[0,0,0,1]\n[0,1,0,0]\n\nHere, the third row's last element changed from 2 to 1. The fourth row's second element changed from 2 to 1. So two changes here, both 2 to 1.\n\nExample 2:\nInput:\n[2,2,0,0]\n[0,2,0,0]\n[2,2,0,2]\n[0,0,0,0]\n[0,2,2,2]\n\nOutput:\n[2,2,0,0]\n[0,2,0,0]\n[2,2,0,1]\n[0,0,0,0]\n[0,2,2,2]\n\nOnly the third row's last element changed from 2 to 1. The other rows with 2s remain the same.\n\nExample 3:\nInput:\n[2,2,0]\n[2,0,2]\n[0,2,0]\n\nOutput:\n[2,2,0]\n[2,0,1]\n[0,1,0]\n\nThe second row's third element went from 2 to 1, and the third row's second element from 2 to 1. So again, 2s turning into 1s in certain positions.\n\nLooking at all examples, it seems that some 2s are being changed to 1s. But which ones? Let's look for a pattern in the positions where 2 is changed to 1.\n\nIn Example 0, the third row's first element was 2 \u2192 1. Looking around, maybe it's about being adjacent to certain numbers or their position in the grid. Let's check the surrounding elements.\n\nIn Example 0, the changed element is at the bottom-left corner. Maybe it's when a 2 is at the end of a row and maybe followed or preceded by 0s? Or perhaps the 2 is isolated? Let me check other examples.\n\nIn Example 1, the third row's last element was 2 \u2192 1. The row is [0,0,0,2], so the 2 is the last element. Then in the fourth row, the second element (2) becomes 1. That row is [0,2,0,0], so the 2 is in the middle.\n\nIn Example 3, the second row's third element (2) becomes 1. That row is [2,0,2]. The third element is at the end. The third row's second element (2) becomes 1. That row is [0,2,0], so the 2 is in the middle.\n\nHmm. Not sure about position. Maybe the 2s that are not adjacent to other 2s? Let's see.\n\nIn Example 0, the third row [2,0,0]. The 2 is alone. So changes to 1. In Example 1, the third row's 2 is alone (surrounded by 0s except maybe below?). Let me check the rows around it. The third row is [0,0,0,2], and the next row is [0,2,0,0]. So the 2 is in the last position, and below it is 0. So maybe 2s that are isolated in some way?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s that are in positions where there's a 0 below them? Let's think.\n\nIn Example 0, the changed 2 is in the third row, first column. The row below it? Well, there is no row below. So maybe if a 2 is in the bottom row, or if there's a 0 directly below. Let's see.\n\nExample 1, the third row's last element (row 2, column 3) has a 2. The next row (row 3) in that column is 0 (since the fourth row is [0,2,0,0], so column 3 is 0). So the 2 is above a 0. Then it's changed to 1. Similarly, the fourth row's second element (2) is in row 3, column 1 (assuming 0-based indexing). The row below that would be row 4, but the input only has 4 rows (indices 0-3). Wait, no. Wait, the input is a 4x4 grid. So in row 3 (fourth row), column 1 (second element) is 2. There's no row below, so again, perhaps the 2 is in the last row, so it's changed. But in that case, in Example 0, the third row is the last row. The 2 is in the last row, so it's changed. But in Example 1, the third row (index 2) is not the last row. The fourth row is index 3. So that 2 in row 2, column 3 (third row, fourth column) has a 0 below it (row 3, column 3 is 0). So perhaps when a 2 has a 0 directly below it, it's converted to 1.\n\nSimilarly, in Example 3, the second row's third element (2) is in row 1, column 2. The row below (row 2) has a 0 in column 2. So the 2 is above a 0. Therefore, that 2 is changed to 1. The third row's second element (2) is in row 2, column 1. The row below (row 3) is [0,2,0], so column 1 in row 3 is 2. Wait, but in that case, the 2 in row 2, column 1 has a 2 below it, so why was it changed to 1? That contradicts the previous hypothesis.\n\nWait, the third row in Example 3's input is [0,2,0], and the output is [0,1,0]. So the 2 in row 2, column 1 becomes 1. What's below it? The next row is row 3, which is part of the output, but maybe in the input? Wait, the input for Example 3 is:\n\nInput:\n[2, 2, 0]\n[2, 0, 2]\n[0, 2, 0]\n\nSo the third row is [0,2,0]. The row below that would be nothing, as it's the last row. So perhaps when a 2 is in the last row, it's converted to 1. But in this case, the 2 in the third row (last row) is changed to 1. So that fits. So in Example 0, the last row's 2 is changed. In Example 1, the third row's last element (which is in a row that's not the last row) is changed because below it is a 0. Wait, but the row below (row 3) in Example 1's input has [0,2,0,0], so column 3 of row 3 is 0. So the 2 in row 2, column 3 (third row, fourth column) has a 0 below. So the rule could be: any 2 that is either in the last row or has a 0 directly below it (in the same column) in the next row gets changed to 1.\n\nTesting this hypothesis across all examples.\n\nLet's check Example 0:\n\nInput's third row is [2,0,0]. It's the last row, so all 2s here should become 1s. But only the first element was 2, and it becomes 1. The other elements are 0, so no change. So that fits.\n\nExample 1:\n\nThird row (row 2) is [0,0,0,2]. The next row (row 3) in column 3 is 0. So the 2 in row 2, column 3 is above a 0. So changed to 1. Then, in row 3, column 1 (the 2 in the input's fourth row) is in row 3. The next row would be row 4, which doesn't exist. So since it's the last row, that 2 would be changed. So row 3, column 1 becomes 1. So the two changes here fit the rule.\n\nExample 2:\n\nThird row (row 2) is [2,2,0,2]. Let's check each 2 in this row. The first element (2) in column 0. Next row (row 3) column 0 is 0. So that 2 is above a 0. Wait, but in the output, only the last element (2) is changed to 1. Wait, the input row is [2,2,0,2]. So columns 0,1,3 are 2s. Let's see their next rows:\n\nRow 3 (next row) for column 0: 0. So the 2 in row 2, column 0 is above a 0 \u2192 should be changed. Similarly, column 1 in row 2 (2) has next row (row 3) column 1 is 0. So that 2 should also be changed. And column 3 in row 2 (2) has next row column 3 as 0. So all three 2s in row 2 should be changed to 1. But in the output, only the last one (column 3) is changed. Hmm, this contradicts the hypothesis.\n\nWait, the output for Example 2 is:\n\n[2,2,0,0]\n[0,2,0,0]\n[2,2,0,1]\n[0,0,0,0]\n[0,2,2,2]\n\nSo in row 2, the first two 2s remain, but the last 2 becomes 1. That's confusing. So according to the previous hypothesis, the first two 2s in row 2 should have 0s below them. Let me check:\n\nRow 2's columns 0: input is 2. Next row (row 3) column 0 is 0. So according to the rule, this 2 should be changed. But in the output, it's still 2. So the hypothesis is invalid here.\n\nHmm. Maybe my initial assumption is wrong. Let's think differently.\n\nAnother approach: maybe the 2s are being converted to 1s if they are adjacent (either horizontally or vertically) to a 0. Let's check.\n\nIn Example 0, the third row's 2 is followed by 0s. So adjacent to 0s. So it's changed. But in Example 3, the 2 in the second row (third element) is adjacent to 0 (since the row is [2,0,2], so 2 is next to 0. That 2 is changed to 1. The third row's 2 is between two 0s. So adjacent to 0s. Changed to 1. So that fits.\n\nIn Example 1, the third row's last element (2) is in a row of [0,0,0,2]. So adjacent to 0 on the left. Changed to 1. The fourth row's 2 is in [0,2,0,0], adjacent to 0s on both sides. Changed to 1. That fits.\n\nIn Example 0's third row [2,0,0], the 2 is adjacent to 0 (next element is 0). So that's why it's changed. But in Example 2, the third row is [2,2,0,2]. Let's see which 2s are adjacent to 0s. The first two 2s (positions 0 and 1) are adjacent to each other and a 0 in position 2. So the third element is 0. So the 2 in position 1 is adjacent to 0 (next element is 0). So why is it not changed? The output for Example 2's third row is [2,2,0,1]. So only the last 2 is changed. That 2 is in position 3, adjacent to 0 (the third element is 0, and next is 2? Wait, no. The third row is [2,2,0,2]. So position 3 (last element) is adjacent to 0 in position 2 and no element to the right. So maybe if a 2 is adjacent to 0 on the right or left, or has a 0 below.\n\nBut this is getting complicated. Maybe the rule is that 2s are turned into 1s if they are in the same column as a 0 below them, but only the topmost such 2. Or maybe there's another pattern.\n\nWait, let's look at the number of 1s in each output. For Example 0, one 1. Example 1, two 1s. Example 2, one 1. Example 3, two 1s. So it's variable. So maybe each 2 that is the last in their column (i.e., the lowest 2 in the column) is turned into 1. Let's check.\n\nIn Example 0, columns are:\n\nColumn 0: 0,0,2 \u2192 the last 2 is in row 2. So changed to 1.\n\nColumn 1: 2,2,0 \u2192 no 2 in the last row. The last 2 is in row 1. So not changed.\n\nColumn 2: 2,2,0 \u2192 same as column 1.\n\nSo only column 0's last 2 is changed. Which matches the output.\n\nIn Example 1:\n\nColumns are:\n\nColumn 0: 2,0,0,0 \u2192 last 2 is in row 0. So no change? But in the output, none of these 2s are changed. The output's first row is same as input.\n\nColumn 1: 2,2,0,2 \u2192 the last 2 is in row 3. So changed to 1. Which matches the fourth row's second element being 1.\n\nColumn 2: 2,0,0,0 \u2192 last 2 is row 0, not changed.\n\nColumn 3: 0,0,2,0 \u2192 the last 2 is in row 2. So changed to 1. Which matches the third row's last element.\n\nSo in Example 1, columns 1 and 3's last 2s are changed. So two changes. Which matches the output.\n\nIn Example 2:\n\nColumns:\n\nColumn 0: 2,0,2,0,0 \u2192 last 2 is in row 2 (third row). So changed to 1. But in the output, row 2's first element is 2. So this doesn't fit.\n\nWait, no. Let me list the input of Example 2:\n\nInput:\n\nRow 0: [2,2,0,0]\n\nRow 1: [0,2,0,0]\n\nRow 2: [2,2,0,2]\n\nRow 3: [0,0,0,0]\n\nRow 4: [0,2,2,2]\n\nSo columns:\n\nColumn 0: 2,0,2,0,0 \u2192 the last 2 is in row 2. So according to the hypothesis, it should be changed to 1. But in the output, row 2, column 0 is still 2. So the hypothesis is invalid here.\n\nHmm. Maybe the rule is different. Let's think again.\n\nAnother angle: perhaps the 2s that are followed by 0s in the same row. Like, in a row, if a 2 is immediately followed by a 0, then the 2 is changed to 1. Let's check.\n\nIn Example 0, third row [2,0,0]. The first 2 is followed by 0. So changed to 1. That fits.\n\nExample 1, third row [0,0,0,2]. The 2 is at the end, followed by nothing. So maybe not. But it's changed to 1.\n\nIn Example 3's input:\n\nSecond row [2,0,2]. The third element (2) is at the end, followed by nothing. But it's changed to 1. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s that are followed by a 0 in the same row (anywhere after) but not adjacent. Or perhaps the last 2 in each row is changed to 1.\n\nLooking at Example 0's third row: last 2 is the first element (row is [2,0,0]). The last 2 in the row is at position 0, which is the first element. Changed to 1.\n\nExample 1's third row [0,0,0,2]: last element is 2 \u2192 changed to 1.\n\nFourth row [0,2,0,0]: last 2 is at position 1. Changed to 1.\n\nExample 2's third row [2,2,0,2]: the last 2 is in position 3. Changed to 1. The other 2s in the same row remain.\n\nExample 3's second row [2,0,2]: last 2 is position 2. Changed to 1. Third row [0,2,0]: last 2 is position 1. Changed to 1.\n\nSo the pattern could be: in each row, change the last occurrence of 2 to 1. Let's check all examples.\n\nExample 0:\n\nInput third row [2,0,0]. The last 2 is the first element (only 2 in the row). Changed to 1. Correct.\n\nExample 1:\n\nThird row [0,0,0,2]. Last 2 is fourth element. Changed to 1. Fourth row [0,2,0,0]. Last 2 is second element. Changed to 1. Correct.\n\nExample 2:\n\nThird row [2,2,0,2]. Last 2 is fourth element. Changed to 1. Other rows in input: row 0 [2,2,0,0] \u2192 last 2 is at position 1. So changed to 1? But in the output, row 0 remains the same. So this contradicts.\n\nWait, in Example 2's output, row 0 and row 1 are unchanged, only row 2's last 2 is changed. So if the pattern is changing the last 2 in each row, then row 0 and row 1 should have their last 2s changed, but they are not. So this hypothesis is wrong.\n\nBut wait in Example 2's input:\n\nRow 0: [2,2,0,0]. The last 2 in this row is position 1. So according to the hypothesis, it should be changed to 1. But in the output, it's still 2. So that's a problem.\n\nHmm. What's different about Example 2? Let's look at the output. Only the third row's last 2 is changed. So maybe the pattern is not changing all rows, but only certain rows. Maybe rows that have at least one 0?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the pattern is that each 2 that is the rightmost 2 in its row and has at least one 0 to the right of it. Let's see.\n\nIn Example 0's third row [2,0,0], the rightmost 2 is the first element (only 2 in the row). To its right are 0s, so it's changed to 1.\n\nExample 1's third row [0,0,0,2] has the rightmost 2 in position 3, no elements to the right (since it's the last element). So perhaps in this case, if there are 0s after the 2 in the same row, then it's changed. But in this case, there are no elements after, so maybe it's considered as having 0s (since it's the end). Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps in each row, the rightmost 2 is changed to 1, but only if there's at least one 0 in the row. Let's test.\n\nExample 0's third row has a 2 and zeros. Rightmost 2 is first element. Changed to 1.\n\nExample 1's third row has a 2 and zeros. Rightmost 2 is changed. Fourth row has 2 and zeros. Rightmost 2 is in position 1. Changed.\n\nExample 2's third row has 2s and zeros. Rightmost 2 is changed. Other rows like row 0 [2,2,0,0], the rightmost 2 is position 1. But since there's a 0 after, but in the output, it's not changed. So this doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. Maybe the rule is that the rightmost 2 in each row is changed to 1, but only if it's not part of a consecutive group of 2s. For example, if a row ends with 2s, then the last one is changed. But in Example 2's third row, the row is [2,2,0,2]. The rightmost 2 is in position 3. The element before it is 0, so it's a single 2. So changed. But the first two 2s in positions 0 and 1 are consecutive. Their rightmost is position 1, but there's a 0 after, but they are part of a group. So maybe in that case, the rightmost of the group is not changed. But this is getting too convoluted.\n\nAlternative approach: perhaps each 2 that is followed by a 0 in the same row is changed to 1. Let's check.\n\nExample 0's third row: 2 is followed by 0. Changed.\n\nExample 1's third row: 2 is at the end, no following element. Not changed. But according to the output, it is changed. So this is conflicting.\n\nAlternatively, if a 2 is followed by a 0 anywhere in the same row, even not directly adjacent. For example, in a row like [2, 0, 2, 0], the first 2 is followed by a 0 later in the row. But this seems too vague.\n\nAnother angle: perhaps the 2s that are the only 2 in their column. Let's see.\n\nIn Example 0, column 0 has 0,0,2. So the only 2 is in row 2. Changed to 1.\n\nOther columns have multiple 2s. So no changes there.\n\nIn Example 1:\n\nColumn 3 has 0,0,2,0. Only one 2 in row 2. Changed to 1.\n\nColumn 1 has 2,2,0,2. So multiple 2s. But in row 3 (fourth row), the 2 is the only one in that column in that row. Wait, no. Column 1 has 2 in rows 0,1,3. So multiple. But in row 3, it's the last 2 in the column. So why is it changed to 1? Maybe not.\n\nHmm. Let me think differently. Maybe it's a gravity-based game where 2s fall down, and if they can't fall, they become 1s. For example, like in a puzzle game where 2s are blocks that fall to the bottom. If a 2 is above a 0, it can fall. If it can't fall (because below is a 0), then maybe it's transformed into a 1. But how?\n\nAlternatively, imagine the grid as columns. For each column, if there's a 2 that is followed by a 0 (i.e., there's a 0 below it in the same column), then that 2 is changed to 1. Let's test this.\n\nExample 0:\n\nColumn 0: [0,0,2]. The 2 in row 2 has nothing below (since it's the last row). So no 0 below. But it was changed to 1. So this doesn't fit.\n\nWait, but maybe if a 2 is in the last row, it's considered as having a 0 below (since there's nothing). So in column 0 of Example 0, the 2 is in the last row. So changed to 1.\n\nColumn 1: [2,2,0]. The 2 in row 1 has a 0 below (row 2). So that 2 would be changed to 1. But in the output, it's still 2. So this hypothesis is invalid.\n\nHmm. This is challenging. Let's look for another pattern.\n\nAnother observation: in all examples, the output has exactly the same structure as the input except that certain 2s are replaced by 1s. So the rule must be identifying specific 2s to replace.\n\nLooking at the positions:\n\nExample 0:\n\nInput row 2: [2,0,0] \u2192 becomes [1,0,0]\n\nExample 1:\n\nInput row 2: [0,0,0,2] \u2192 becomes [0,0,0,1]\n\nInput row 3: [0,2,0,0] \u2192 becomes [0,1,0,0]\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput row 2: [2,2,0,2] \u2192 becomes [2,2,0,1]\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput row 1: [2,0,2] \u2192 becomes [2,0,1]\n\nInput row 2: [0,2,0] \u2192 becomes [0,1,0]\n\nSo in each case, the 2 that's changed to 1 is either the last 2 in the row or in a position that's followed by 0s.\n\nWait, looking at the rows where changes occur:\n\nIn Example 0's third row: [2,0,0] \u2192 2 is followed by 0s. Changed.\n\nIn Example 1's third row: [0,0,0,2] \u2192 2 is at the end. Changed.\n\nFourth row: [0,2,0,0] \u2192 2 is followed by 0s. Changed.\n\nIn Example 2's third row: [2,2,0,2] \u2192 the last 2 is followed by nothing (end of row). Changed.\n\nIn Example 3's second row: [2,0,2] \u2192 the last 2 is followed by nothing. Changed.\n\nThird row: [0,2,0] \u2192 2 is between 0s. Changed.\n\nSo perhaps the rule is: any 2 that is either the last element in its row or is followed by one or more 0s in the same row is changed to 1.\n\nBut wait, in Example 3's third row [0,2,0], the 2 is between 0s but not followed by 0s. It's surrounded by 0s. So perhaps the rule is that if a 2 is followed by a 0 (anywhere after it in the row, not necessarily immediately), then it's changed. But in that case, any 2 that's not at the end of the row and has a 0 after it would be changed.\n\nWait, in Example 3's third row [0,2,0], the 2 is at position 1. The elements after it are [0]. So the 2 is followed by 0. So it's changed. That fits.\n\nIn Example 0's third row, the 2 is followed by two 0s. So changed.\n\nIn Example 1's third row, the 2 is at the end. No 0 after. But it's changed. So maybe the rule is that a 2 is changed to 1 if it is the last element in the row or if there's at least one 0 after it in the row.\n\nYes, that seems to fit.\n\nLet's test this hypothesis across all examples.\n\nExample 0:\n\nThird row [2,0,0]. The 2 is followed by 0s. Changed.\n\nExample 1:\n\nThird row [0,0,0,2]. The 2 is last element \u2192 changed.\n\nFourth row [0,2,0,0]. The 2 is at position 1. Followed by 0s \u2192 changed.\n\nExample 2:\n\nThird row [2,2,0,2]. The last 2 is at position 3 (end) \u2192 changed.\n\nOther 2s in the same row (positions 0 and 1) are followed by 2 and 0. So 2 at position 0 is followed by 2 (no 0), position 1 is followed by 0. Wait, row 2 is [2,2,0,2]. So for position 0 (2), the elements after are [2,0,2]. There's a 0 after, but after the 2 at position 0. So according to the rule, any 2 that has a 0 after it (anywhere in the row) is changed. So position 0's 2 is followed by a 0 (at position 2), so should be changed. But in the output, it's not changed. So this contradicts.\n\nWait, this hypothesis doesn't hold for Example 2.\n\nSo maybe the rule is that the 2 must be immediately followed by a 0. Let's check.\n\nExample 0's third row: 2 is followed by 0 (immediately). Changed.\n\nExample 1's third row: 2 is at the end. Not immediately followed by 0. But changed. So this doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. Maybe the rule is that if a 2 is followed by a 0 in the same row, regardless of position, then it's changed. But in Example 2's third row, the 2 at position 1 is followed by a 0 at position 2. So according to the rule, it should be changed. But in the output, it's not. So this is a problem.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 2 must be the last 2 in the row and followed by 0s. Let's see.\n\nFor Example 2's third row, the 2s are in positions 0, 1, 3. The last 2 is at position 3. Followed by nothing. So changed. The other 2s are followed by other 2s or 0. But only the last one is changed. So maybe the rule is: for each row, change the last occurrence of 2 to 1 if it is followed by any number of 0s (including none if it's at the end of the row).\n\nThis would explain Example 0: last 2 in the row is the first element, followed by 0s. Changed.\n\nExample 1's third row: last 2 is at the end, followed by nothing. Changed. Fourth row: last 2 is position 1, followed by 0s. Changed.\n\nExample 2's third row: last 2 is position 3. Changed.\n\nExample 3's second row: last 2 is position 2. Changed. Third row: last 2 is position 1. Changed.\n\nBut in Example 2's third row, there's a 2 at position 3 which is the last 2 in the row. So it's changed. The other 2s in the same row are not the last, so not changed. This fits.\n\nNow, let's check if this rule works for all examples.\n\nExample 0's third row: only one 2. So last is position 0. Changed.\n\nExample 1's third row: last 2 is position 3. Changed. Fourth row's last 2 is position 1. Changed.\n\nExample 2's third row: last 2 is position 3. Changed. Other rows: in row 0, last 2 is position 1 (row [2,2,0,0]). So last 2 is at position 1. Followed by 0s. Should be changed. But in the output, row 0 remains the same. So this contradicts.\n\nAh, this is a problem. Why in Example 2's output, row 0's last 2 (position 1) is not changed to 1? So this rule doesn't hold for Example 2.\n\nSo, what's different between row 0 of Example 2 and other rows? Let's look at the output for Example 2. The output's row 0 is [2,2,0,0], same as input. So no change. But according to the rule, the last 2 in row 0 is at position 1, followed by 0s. So it should be changed to 1, but it's not.\n\nHmm. So this indicates the rule is not simply changing the last 2 in each row. There must be another condition.\n\nAnother observation: in Example 2's row 0, there are two 2s followed by 0s. But the output doesn't change them. So perhaps the rule is that the last 2 in the entire grid is changed. But that doesn't make sense.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is to change the last 2 in each column. Let's check.\n\nExample 0's column 0 has 2 in the last row. Changed to 1.\n\nExample 1's column 3 has 2 in row 2. Changed to 1. Column 1 has 2 in row 3. Changed to 1.\n\nExample 2's column 3 has 2 in row 2. Changed to 1. Other columns have last 2s in other rows, but not changed.\n\nExample 3's column 2 has 2 in row 1. Changed to 1. Column 1 has 2 in row 2. Changed to 1.\n\nSo this seems to fit. The pattern is that in each column, the lowest 2 (the last 2 in the column) is changed to 1. Let's verify.\n\nExample 0:\n\nColumns:\n\nColumn 0: [0,0,2]. Last 2 \u2192 row 2. Changed to 1.\n\nColumn 1: [2,2,0]. Last 2 is row 1. Not changed.\n\nColumn 2: [2,2,0]. Last 2 is row 1. Not changed.\n\nSo only one change. Correct.\n\nExample 1:\n\nColumns:\n\nColumn 0: [2,0,0,0]. Last 2 is row 0. Not changed.\n\nColumn 1: [2,2,0,2]. Last 2 is row 3. Changed to 1.\n\nColumn 2: [2,0,0,0]. Last 2 is row 0. Not changed.\n\nColumn 3: [0,0,2,0]. Last 2 is row 2. Changed to 1.\n\nSo two changes. Correct.\n\nExample 2:\n\nColumns:\n\nColumn 0: [2,0,2,0,0]. Last 2 is row 2. Changed to 1? But in output, row 2's column 0 is still 2. So this is incorrect.\n\nHmm. So this hypothesis is invalid.\n\nWait, in Example 2's input:\n\nColumn 0: rows 0:2, row 2:2. So last 2 is row 2. Changed to 1. But in output, row 2's column 0 is 2. So this doesn't fit. So the hypothesis is wrong.\n\nThis is getting frustrating. Maybe I need to think differently.\n\nAnother approach: looking for the number of 1s in the output. For each example:\n\nExample 0: 1 change.\n\nExample 1: 2 changes.\n\nExample 2: 1 change.\n\nExample 3: 2 changes.\n\nSo perhaps the rule is that each column with an odd number of 2s has the bottom-most 2 changed to 1. Let's see:\n\nExample 0's column 0 has one 2 (odd). Changed. Columns 1 and 2 have two 2s (even). Not changed.\n\nExample 1's column 1 has three 2s (row 0,1,3). Odd. Changed. Column 3 has one 2. Changed. So two changes.\n\nExample 2's column 3 has one 2 (row 2). Changed. Other columns have even numbers. So one change.\n\nExample 3's column 1 has two 2s (row 0, row 2). Even. Wait, no. Input for Example 3 is:\n\nRow 0: [2,2,0]\n\nRow 1: [2,0,2]\n\nRow 2: [0,2,0]\n\nSo column 0: 2,2,0 \u2192 two 2s (even). Column 1: 2,0,2 \u2192 two 2s (even). Column 2: 0,2,0 \u2192 one 2 (odd). So only column 2 would be changed. But in the output, two changes. So this doesn't fit.\n\nSo this hypothesis is also wrong.\n\nAnother idea: maybe each 2 that is the only 2 in its row is changed to 1. Let's check.\n\nExample 0's third row has one 2 \u2192 changed. Correct.\n\nExample 1's third row has one 2 \u2192 changed. Fourth row has one 2 \u2192 changed. Correct.\n\nExample 2's third row has three 2s \u2192 only the last one is changed. So this doesn't fit.\n\nExample 3's second row has two 2s \u2192 but one is changed. So this is not matching.\n\nSo this is not the rule.\n\nAlternative approach: let's see the difference between input and output in each example. Maybe the 2s that are in a position where they are the only 2 in their row and column, or something like that.\n\nExample 0's changed 2: row 2, column 0. In the input, column 0 has 0s in rows 0 and 1, and 2 in row 2. So it's the only 2 in that column. So changed.\n\nExample 1's first change: row 2, column 3. Column 3 has only one 2. Changed. Second change: row 3, column 1. Column 1 has multiple 2s. So this contradicts.\n\nHmm.\n\nAnother observation: in all examples, the 2s that are changed to 1s are the only ones in their respective row or column. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's related to the number of 2s in the row or column. For instance, if a row contains an even number of 2s, the last one is changed. But this doesn't seem to hold.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 2s that are at positions where they are the first in their row and column. Not sure.\n\nThis is really challenging. Let's try to see if there's a spatial pattern. For example, the 2s that are in the \"bottom-right\" part of the grid.\n\nIn Example 0's output, the changed 2 is at the bottom-left.\n\nExample 1's changed 2s are at the bottom of their columns (row 2, column 3 and row 3, column 1).\n\nExample 2's changed 2 is at row 2, column 3.\n\nExample 3's changed 2s are at row 1, column 2 and row 2, column 1.\n\nNot sure.\n\nAlternative idea: maybe the 2s that are the lowest in their respective column (i.e., the last occurrence in the column) are changed to 1. Let's check this.\n\nExample 0:\n\nColumn 0: lowest 2 is row 2 \u2192 changed.\n\nOther columns' lowest 2s are in earlier rows \u2192 not changed.\n\nExample 1:\n\nColumn 1: lowest 2 is row 3 \u2192 changed.\n\nColumn 3: lowest 2 is row 2 \u2192 changed.\n\nExample 2:\n\nColumn 3: lowest 2 is row 2 \u2192 changed.\n\nOther columns have lowest 2s in higher rows \u2192 not changed.\n\nExample 3:\n\nColumn 0: lowest 2 is row 1 \u2192 not changed.\n\nColumn 1: lowest 2 is row 2 \u2192 changed.\n\nColumn 2: lowest 2 is row 1 \u2192 changed.\n\nWait, but in Example 3's input:\n\nColumn 0: 2,2,0 \u2192 lowest 2 is row 1 (second row? Assuming rows are 0-based). So row 0 and 1 have 2s. The lowest is row 1.\n\nColumn 1: 2,0,2 \u2192 the lowest 2 is row 2 (third row).\n\nColumn 2: 0,2,0 \u2192 lowest 2 is row 1.\n\nSo according to the rule, column 1's lowest 2 (row 2) is changed, and column 2's lowest 2 (row 1) is changed. Which matches the output: row 2, column 1 (changed to 1), and row 1, column 2 (changed to 1). Yes. So this seems to fit.\n\nExample 0: column 0's lowest 2 is changed.\n\nExample 1: columns 1 and 3's lowest 2s are changed.\n\nExample 2: column 3's lowest 2 is changed.\n\nExample 3: columns 1 and 2's lowest 2s are changed.\n\nSo the pattern is: for each column, change the lowest (i.e., last occurrence in the column) 2 to 1.\n\nYes, this fits all examples.\n\nLet's verify.\n\nExample 0:\n\nColumns:\n\n0: [0,0,2] \u2192 lowest 2 at row 2 \u2192 changed to 1.\n\nColumns 1 and 2: their lowest 2s are in row 1. Not changed.\n\nExample 1:\n\nColumns:\n\n1: [2,2,0,2] \u2192 lowest 2 at row 3 \u2192 changed to 1.\n\n3: [0,0,2,0] \u2192 lowest 2 at row 2 \u2192 changed to 1.\n\nExample 2:\n\nColumn 3: [0,0,2,0,2] \u2192 wait, wait. Let's check the columns of Example 2's input.\n\nExample 2's input is:\n\nRow 0: [2,2,0,0]\n\nRow 1: [0,2,0,0]\n\nRow 2: [2,2,0,2]\n\nRow 3: [0,0,0,0]\n\nRow 4: [0,2,2,2]\n\nSo columns:\n\nColumn 0: [2,0,2,0,0]. The 2s are at rows 0 and 2. Lowest is row 2.\n\nColumn 1: [2,2,2,0,2]. The 2s are at rows 0,1,2,4. Lowest is row 4.\n\nColumn 2: [0,0,0,0,2]. Lowest 2 is row 4.\n\nColumn 3: [0,0,2,0,2]. Lowest 2 is row 4.\n\nSo according to the rule, in each column, the lowest 2 should be changed to 1. But in the output, only the third row's column 3 is changed to 1. But according to this rule, column 3's lowest 2 is in row 4. So why is row 2's column 3 changed?\n\nWait, this suggests that the rule is incorrect. Because in Example 2's input, column 3 has 2s in row 2 and row 4. So the lowest 2 is row 4. So according to the rule, row 4's column 3 should be changed. But in the output, it's row 2's column 3 that's changed. So this is a contradiction.\n\nAh, so this hypothesis is invalid. What's wrong here?\n\nWait, looking at the output for Example 2:\n\nOutput:\n\n[2,2,0,0]\n\n[0,2,0,0]\n\n[2,2,0,1]\n\n[0,0,0,0]\n\n[0,2,2,2]\n\nSo column 3's lowest 2 in the input is row 4 (value 2). But in the output, it's still 2. The changed 2 is in row 2, column 3. Which is not the lowest in the column. So this contradicts the previous hypothesis.\n\nSo this rule doesn't hold for Example 2. I must have made a mistake in the hypothesis.\n\nThis is really tricky. Let's try to think of another approach.\n\nPerhaps the rule is to change every 2 that has a 0 directly below it. So for each cell (i,j), if it contains a 2 and cell (i+1,j) contains a 0, then it's changed to 1.\n\nLet's check:\n\nExample 0's third row (row 2) is the last row. So no cell below. So according to this rule, any 2 in the last row would be changed. So the 2 in row 2, column 0 is changed to 1. Correct.\n\nExample 1's third row (row 2), column 3: the cell below (row 3, column 3) is 0. So changed to 1. Fourth row (row 3), column 1: cell below (row 4) doesn't exist. So last row. Changed to 1. Correct.\n\nExample 2's third row (row 2), column 3: cell below (row 3, column 3) is 0. So changed to 1. Other 2s in row 2, columns 0 and 1: cell below (row 3) columns 0 and 1 are 0. So those 2s should also be changed. But in the output, they are not. So this contradicts.\n\nSo the hypothesis is invalid.\n\nBut wait, in Example 2's third row (row 2), the 2 in column 0 has a cell below (row 3, column 0) which is 0. So according to the rule, it should be changed. But in the output, it's still 2. So this is a problem.\n\nPerhaps the rule is to change only the last such 2 in the column. For example, in a column, the highest 2 that has a 0 below it is changed. But this is getting complicated.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each 2 that has a 0 below it, and is the lowest such 2 in its column.\n\nWait, for Example 0's column 0: the 2 is in the last row. So no cell below. So it's changed.\n\nExample 1's column 3: the 2 is in row 2. The cell below is 0 (row 3, column 3). So changed.\n\nExample 1's column 1: the 2 in row 3 is the last row. So changed.\n\nExample 2's column 3: the 2 in row 2 has a 0 below (row 3). But there's also a 2 in row 4. So the 2 in row 4 is in the last row, so it's changed. But in the output, row 4's column 3 is still 2. So this doesn't fit.\n\nThis is really challenging. I'm running out of ideas. Maybe I should look for another pattern.\n\nLooking at the examples, the changed 2s are often at the end of the row or column. Maybe it's a combination of row and column positions.\n\nAnother idea: maybe for each 2, if it is the only 2 in its row and column, it's changed to 1. But this doesn't fit Example 0, where the changed 2 is in a row with other 0s and a column with other 0s.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 2s are being changed to 1s in a way that resembles the game of Minesweeper, where the number indicates the number of adjacent mines. But this is a stretch.\n\nWait, let's look at the numbers. The outputs have 1s where there were 2s. Maybe each 1 represents the number of 0s adjacent to that position in the input. Let's check.\n\nExample 0's changed cell (row 2, column 0): adjacent cells are row 1, column 0 (0), row 2, column 1 (0). So two 0s. But it's changed to 1. Doesn't match.\n\nExample 1's changed cell in row 2, column 3: adjacent cells are row 1, column 3 (0), row 3, column 3 (0), and row 2, column 2 (0). Three 0s. But output is 1.\n\nThis doesn't fit.\n\nAnother approach: perhaps the 1s are replacing 2s that are in positions where the number of 2s in the same row is equal to the number of 2s in the same column. But this is too complex and doesn't seem to fit.\n\nAlternatively, think about the 2s that are in the same position as the number of 2s in their row or column.\n\nBut I'm stuck. Given the time I've spent and the lack of progress, maybe I should try to apply the last hypothesis I had, even though Example 2 seems to contradict it. Because maybe there's a mistake in my analysis.\n\nThe hypothesis: in each column, change the lowest 2 (last occurrence) to 1.\n\nThis worked for all examples except Example 2, but perhaps I made a mistake in analyzing Example 2's columns.\n\nLet me re-express Example 2's columns:\n\nTest Input for Example 2:\n\nRow 0: [2,2,0,0]\n\nRow 1: [0,2,0,0]\n\nRow 2: [2,2,0,2]\n\nRow 3: [0,0,0,0]\n\nRow 4: [0,2,2,2]\n\nColumns:\n\nColumn 0: rows 0 (2), 2 (2). So lowest 2 is row 2.\n\nColumn 1: rows 0 (2), 1 (2), 2 (2), 4 (2). Lowest is row 4.\n\nColumn 2: rows 4 (2). Lowest is row 4.\n\nColumn 3: rows 2 (2), 4 (2). Lowest is row 4.\n\nSo according to the hypothesis, the changes should be in:\n\nColumn 0: row 2 \u2192 2 \u2192 1.\n\nColumn 1: row 4 \u2192 2 \u2192 1.\n\nColumn 2: row 4 \u2192 2 \u2192 1.\n\nColumn 3: row 4 \u2192 2 \u2192 1.\n\nBut the output for Example 2 is:\n\n[2,2,0,0]\n\n[0,2,0,0]\n\n[2,2,0,1]\n\n[0,0,0,0]\n\n[0,2,2,2]\n\nSo only row 2, column 3 is changed. Which doesn't fit. So this hypothesis is incorrect.\n\nAt this point, I'm not sure. Maybe the pattern is that the 2s in the last possible position when the grid is read left to right, top to bottom. Or maybe it's the last 2 in the entire grid. But in Example 3's input, the last 2 is in row 2, column 1. Which is changed.\n\nAlternatively, the 2s that are in positions where the cell to the right and below are 0. But this is speculative.\n\nGiven that I'm struggling, perhaps I should try to apply the rule that seems to work for most examples, even if it doesn't fit Example 2 perfectly. For example, the rule of changing the last 2 in each row to 1.\n\nApplying that to the test input:\n\nTest Input:\n\n[2,2,0,2] \u2192 row 0. Last 2 in this row is position 3.\n\n[0,2,0,0] \u2192 row 1. Last 2 in position 1.\n\n[0,0,2,0] \u2192 row 2. Last 2 in position 2.\n\n[2,0,0,0] \u2192 row 3. Last 2 in position 0.\n\n[0,0,2,2] \u2192 row 4. Last 2 in position 3.\n\nAccording to this rule, all these 2s should be changed to 1.\n\nBut according to the training examples, sometimes only certain rows are changed. For example, in Example 2, row 0's last 2 wasn't changed. So this suggests that the rule isn't applied to all rows.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps only rows that have at least one 0 after the last 2 are changed. Let's see:\n\nTest Input:\n\nRow 0: [2,2,0,2]. The last 2 is at position 3. No 0 after. So not changed.\n\nRow 1: [0,2,0,0]. Last 2 at position 1. Followed by 0s. Changed to 1.\n\nRow 2: [0,0,2,0]. Last 2 at position 2. Followed by 0. Changed to 1.\n\nRow 3: [2,0,0,0]. Last 2 at position 0. Followed by 0s. Changed to 1.\n\nRow 4: [0,0,2,2]. Last 2 at position 3. No 0 after. Not changed.\n\nSo the changes would be in rows 1, 2, 3.\n\nApplying this to the test input:\n\nRow 0: [2,2,0,2] \u2192 no change.\n\nRow 1: [0,1,0,0].\n\nRow 2: [0,0,1,0].\n\nRow 3: [1,0,0,0].\n\nRow 4: [0,0,2,2] \u2192 no change.\n\nBut looking at the training examples, this doesn't match. For instance, in Example 1's row 3, the last 2 is at position 1, followed by 0s, changed to 1. Which fits.\n\nBut in Example 2's row 0, the last 2 is followed by 0s, but in the output, it wasn't changed. So this contradicts.\n\nBut perhaps there's another condition. Maybe rows where the last 2 is followed by at least one 0, but not in the first position. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule is to change the last 2 in a row to 1 if there's a 0 anywhere after it in the row.\n\nFor the test input:\n\nRow 0's last 2 is at position 3. No 0s after. So no change.\n\nRow 1's last 2 is at position 1. Followed by 0s. Changed.\n\nRow 2's last 2 is at position 2. Followed by 0. Changed.\n\nRow 3's last 2 is at position 0. Followed by 0s. Changed.\n\nRow 4's last 2 is at position 3. No 0s after. No change.\n\nSo the output would be:\n\n[2,2,0,2]\n\n[0,1,0,0]\n\n[0,0,1,0]\n\n[1,0,0,0]\n\n[0,0,2,2]\n\nBut looking at the training examples, like Example 1's fourth row [0,2,0,0], the last 2 is changed to 1, which fits this rule.\n\nHowever, in Example 2's row 0, the last 2 is at position 1, followed by 0s. But in the output, it wasn't changed. So why?\n\nAh, because in Example 2's input, row 0 is [2,2,0,0]. The last 2 is at position 1. Followed by 0s. According to the rule, it should be changed to 1. But the output doesn't change it. So this rule doesn't hold.\n\nThis suggests that there's another condition, like the row must have at least two 2s before changing the last one. But in Example 3's second row [2,0,2], which has two 2s, the last is changed. So this doesn't explain it.\n\nAt this point, I'm stuck. The pattern is elusive. Given the time constraints, I'll proceed with the hypothesis that in each row, the last 2 is changed to 1 if there is a 0 after it in the row. Applying this to the test input.\n\nTest input:\n\nRow 0: [2,2,0,2]. Last 2 is at position 3. No 0 after. Not changed.\n\nRow 1: [0,2,0,0]. Last 2 at position 1. Followed by 0. Changed to 1.\n\nRow 2: [0,0,2,0]. Last 2 at position 2. Followed by 0. Changed to 1.\n\nRow 3: [2,0,0,0]. Last 2 at position 0. Followed by 0. Changed to 1.\n\nRow 4: [0,0,2,2]. Last 2 at position 3. No 0 after. Not changed.\n\nSo the output would be:\n\n[2,2,0,2]\n\n[0,1,0,0]\n\n[0,0,1,0]\n\n[1,0,0,0]\n\n[0,0,2,2]\n\nBut looking at the training examples, like Example 2's third row [2,2,0,2], the last 2 is changed to 1, which fits. But why row 0 of Example 2 isn't changed? Because in Example 2's row 0, the last 2 is at position 1, followed by 0s. So according to the rule, it should be changed. But it isn't. So there must be another condition.\n\nMaybe the rule is that the 2 must be the only 2 in the row, or have 0s after. But this isn't consistent.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule is to change the last 2 in each row to 1, regardless of what's after.\n\nTest input output would then have changes in all rows except row 4's last 2 is at position 3, no 0 after. Wait, no. If the rule is to change the last 2 in each row regardless:\n\nRow 0: last 2 at 3 \u2192 change to 1.\n\nRow 1: last 2 at 1 \u2192 change.\n\nRow 2: last 2 at 2 \u2192 change.\n\nRow 3: last 2 at 0 \u2192 change.\n\nRow 4: last 2 at 3 \u2192 change.\n\nSo output would have 1s in those positions. But according to training examples like Example 2's output, not all last 2s are changed. So this can't be.\n\nAfter hours of analysis, I'm forced to make an educated guess. Based on the majority of examples, the pattern seems to be changing the last 2 in each row if there's a 0 after it. Even though Example 2's row 0 contradicts, perhaps that's an exception or there's a different rule.\n\nBut given the time, I'll proceed with applying this rule to the test input."
