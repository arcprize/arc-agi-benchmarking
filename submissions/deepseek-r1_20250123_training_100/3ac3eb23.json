        "cot_1": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. So, looking at the training examples, both Example 0 and Example 1 have inputs with some numbers and a bunch of zeros. The outputs are these repeated patterns that alternate between the original row and a transformed one.\n\nIn Example 0, the input has [0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0] in the first row and the rest are zeros. The output alternates between that original row and a new row where each non-zero number is shifted to the left and right. Like, the 2 becomes 2 on the left and right in the next row, and the 8 does the same. Then it repeats this pattern down the rows. So row 0 is original, row 1 is shifted, row 2 is original again, row 3 shifted, etc.\n\nSimilarly, in Example 1, the input has 4 in the second position. The output alternates between the original row and one where 4 is split into 4 on either side. The same pattern of alternating rows.\n\nSo the pattern seems to be that each non-zero number in a row is split into two copies in the next row, placed to the left and right of the original position. Then the next row reverts to the original. But wait, in the outputs, the rows alternate between the original and the spread-out version. For example, in Example 0, row 0 is original, row 1 is spread, row 2 original, row 3 spread, etc.\n\nWait, looking at the outputs, the even-numbered rows (0, 2, 4) are the original input rows, and the odd-numbered rows (1, 3, 5) are the transformed ones where each non-zero is split into adjacent positions. So for each non-zero element in row i, the next row (i+1) has those values split left and right. Then row i+2 is the original again. Wait, but in the examples, the first row (row 0) is original, then row 1 is transformed, row 2 original, etc. So the transformation alternates between the original and the transformed row, creating a kind of wave pattern.\n\nSo the rule is: starting from the input row (which becomes the first row of the output), each subsequent row alternates between being transformed and original. Wait, no. Let's see Example 0: the input is 6 rows of zeros except the first. The output is 6 rows. The first output row is the input row. Then the next row is transformed. The third row is the same as the first, fourth as the second, etc. So it's like, each even row (0,2,4) is the original, and each odd row (1,3,5) is the transformed version. But wait, how is the transformed version generated?\n\nLooking at the transformed row (row 1 in Example 0): the original row has 2 at index 1 and 8 at index 5. The transformed row (row1) has 2 at index 0 and 2 at index 2 (split left and right from 1), and 8 at index 4 and 6 (split left and right from 5). So each non-zero number is split into two copies, placed in the positions adjacent to the original. So for a number at position i, the next row (transformed) would have the same value at i-1 and i+1, but only if those positions exist. Wait, but in Example 0's transformed row, the original 2 is at index1. In the transformed row, we have 2 at 0 and 2 at 2. Similarly, the 8 at index5 becomes 8 at 4 and 6. So it's spreading each non-zero to left and right.\n\nSo the transformation step takes each non-zero element and spreads it to the left and right positions, summing if necessary. Wait, but in the examples, the transformed rows only have the split values. For example, in Example 0's input row, after the first row, the transformed row has 2,0,2,0,8,0,8, etc. So the original 2 in position1 becomes 2 in position0 and 2 in position2, and the original 8 in position5 becomes 8 in position4 and 8 in position6.\n\nBut how about when two spreads overlap? Like if two non-zero elements are adjacent. But in the examples given, the original rows have non-zeros spaced apart. Let's check Example1. The original row is [0,4,0,...]. The transformed row is [4,0,4, ...], so the 4 is split into left and right. Then the next row is original again.\n\nSo the pattern is that each original row (even rows) is kept as is, and the odd rows are the transformed ones where each non-zero in the previous row (even row) is split into left and right. Then the next even row is again the original. So the output alternates between the original and transformed rows.\n\nWait, but in the outputs, the transformed rows are generated from the original rows. For example, in Example0, row1 is generated from row0. Then row2 is row0 again, row3 is row1's transformed version (but how?), no. Wait, maybe the transformed row is generated by taking the previous original row (the even row above it) and splitting each non-zero into left and right. Then the next row is the original again, and so on.\n\nSo for the test input, the first row is [0,0,3,0,0,0,6,0,0,7,0,0]. So the output's first row should be the same. Then the second row (row1) is generated by splitting each non-zero in row0. Let's see:\n\nOriginal row0 has 3 at index2, 6 at index6, 7 at index9.\n\nSo in row1, each of these will be split into left and right. But need to check if the indices are valid.\n\nFor 3 at index2: left is index1, right is index3. So row1 will have 3 at index1 and 3 at index3.\n\nFor 6 at index6: left is 5, right is7. So 6 at 5 and 7.\n\nFor 7 at index9: left is8, right is10. So 7 at8 and10.\n\nSo row1 would be:\n\n[0,3,0,3,0,6,0,6,7,0,7,0]\n\nWait, let's check:\n\nOriginal positions:\n\nIndices 0:0, 1:0, 2:3, 3:0, 4:0, 5:0, 6:6, 7:0, 8:0,9:7,10:0,11:0.\n\nTransforming each non-zero:\n\n3 at 2: spread to 1 and3.\n\n6 at6: spread to5 and7.\n\n7 at9: spread to8 and10.\n\nSo row1 would be:\n\nindex0:0\n\n1:3 (from 2's left)\n\n2:0 (original is 3, but transformed in row1)\n\n3:3 (from 2's right)\n\n4:0\n\n5:6 (from6's left)\n\n6:0\n\n7:6 (from6's right)\n\n8:7 (from9's left)\n\n9:0\n\n10:7 (from9's right)\n\n11:0\n\nSo row1 would be [0,3,0,3,0,6,0,6,7,0,7,0]\n\nThen row2 would be the same as row0: [0,0,3,0,0,0,6,0,0,7,0,0]\n\nRow3 would be same as row1.\n\nRow4 same as row0.\n\nRow5 same as row1.\n\nSo the output would be:\n\nRow0: original\n\nRow1: transformed as above\n\nRow2: original\n\nRow3: transformed\n\nRow4: original\n\nRow5: transformed\n\nSo let's check the structure. The output rows would alternate between the original and the transformed row.\n\nSo the test input's output should be:\n\n[0,0,3,0,0,0,6,0,0,7,0,0]\n\n[0,3,0,3,0,6,0,6,7,0,7,0]\n\n[0,0,3,0,0,0,6,0,0,7,0,0]\n\n[0,3,0,3,0,6,0,6,7,0,7,0]\n\n[0,0,3,0,0,0,6,0,0,7,0,0]\n\n[0,3,0,3,0,6,0,6,7,0,7,0]\n\nWait, but looking at the training examples, the transformed rows have the spread values. Let's confirm with Example0's input:\n\nOriginal row0: [0,2,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow1 transformed: [2,0,2,0,8,0,8,0,0,0]\n\nSo the 2 at index1 splits into index0 and2, which are 2 and2. The 8 at index5 splits into4 and6, which are8 and8. So in the transformed row, the original positions become zero, and the adjacent positions get the original value.\n\nSo applying that to the test input:\n\nOriginal row0 has 3 at2, 6 at6,7 at9.\n\nTransformed row1:\n\nFor 3 at2: left1 and right3 \u2192 set to3 each. So positions1 and3 become3, position2 becomes0.\n\nFor6 at6: left5 and right7 \u2192 6 each. Positions5 and7 become6.\n\nFor7 at9: left8 and right10 \u21927 each. Positions8 and10 become7.\n\nSo the transformed row is:\n\n[0,3,0,3,0,6,0,6,7,0,7,0]\n\nThen the next row (row2) is same as row0, row3 same as row1, etc.\n\nTherefore, the output should be:\n\nRow0: original input row0\n\nRow1: transformed as above\n\nRow2: same as row0\n\nRow3: same as row1\n\nRow4: same as row0\n\nRow5: same as row1\n\nSo the final output should be six rows alternating between the original and transformed versions.",

        "cot_2": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. So, looking at the training examples, the input is a grid of numbers with some non-zero values, and the output seems to be a transformed version of that grid. Let's start with Example 0.\n\nIn Example 0, the input has [0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0] in the first row and all zeros in the subsequent rows. The output alternates between rows similar to the input and rows where the 2 and 8 are each shifted left and right, creating adjacent values. For instance, the second row in the output is [2, 0, 2, 0, 8, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0]. It looks like each non-zero number in the original row is being split into two instances in the next row, one to the left and one to the right. Then the pattern alternates between the original and the split rows.\n\nSimilarly, in Example 1, the input has a 4 in the second position. The output alternates between the original row and rows where 4 is split into two 4s on either side. So the second row becomes [4, 0, 4, 0, ...], then the third row goes back to the original pattern, and so on.\n\nSo the pattern seems to be that each non-zero element in a row is \"spread\" to the left and right in the next row, creating two instances of the same value adjacent to the original position, but alternating rows. Then, the following row reverts to the original positions, creating an alternating pattern between the original and the spread rows. \n\nWait, looking at Example 0's output: the first row is the original, the second row splits each non-zero into left and right, the third row is same as the first, the fourth same as the second, etc. So it's alternating between the original row and the split version. But how exactly does the split work?\n\nIn Example 0's input row, the non-zero elements are at positions 1 (2) and 5 (8). In the output's second row, those become 2 at positions 0 and 2 (left and right of 1) and 8 at positions 4 and 6 (left and right of 5). Then the third row is back to the original. So it's like each non-zero value is creating a left and right neighbor in the next row, but the original row comes back again. Then the pattern repeats every two rows.\n\nSo the transformation is: starting from the input row, generate an alternating pattern where each subsequent row alternates between the original positions and the spread positions. For each non-zero number in the current row, the next row (if it's the spread step) will have that number at position i-1 and i+1, with the original position becoming zero? Wait, but in the examples, the original position becomes zero in the spread row. Wait in Example 0's input row, position 1 has 2. The next row (row 1) has 2 at positions 0 and 2. So the original position (1) is zero in the spread row. Similarly, position 5 (8) becomes positions 4 and 6. Then row 2 is the same as the original again. Then row 3 is the spread again, etc.\n\nWait, that's a bit confusing. Because in the output for Example 0, the rows alternate between the original and spread versions. So row 0 is original, row 1 is spread, row 2 is original again, row 3 spread, etc. But how does that happen when the original rows below are all zeros? Because in the input, all rows after the first are zeros. So the transformation must be that the input is the first row, and then each subsequent row is generated by spreading the non-zero elements of the previous row, but alternating between spread and original. Wait, but the output rows after the first alternate between spread and original. So perhaps each even row (0, 2, 4) is the original, and the odd rows (1,3,5) are the spread versions. But how do the spread rows affect the next rows?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the pattern is that each row after the first is generated based on the previous row. Let me look again. In Example 0's output:\n\nRow 0: original [0,2,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow 1: [2,0,2,0,8,0,8,0,0,0] \u2192 this is spreading each non-zero from row 0 to left and right, and setting the original position to zero. Then row 2 is the same as row 0, and row 3 is same as row 1 again. So it's like the even rows are the original, and the odd rows are the spread versions of the even rows. So every even row is the original, and every odd row is the spread of the even row above it. Then the next even row is the same as the original, but how? Because if row 1 is spread from row 0, then row 2 would be spread from row 1? But row 2 is same as row 0. So perhaps the pattern is that each even row is the original, and each odd row is the spread of the previous even row, and then the next even row is same as the original. So the process is not cumulative; instead, the original row is repeated every other row, and the spread rows are generated from the original each time. Because otherwise, if row 2 was generated by spreading row 1, which has 2s and 8s spread out, then row 2 would have even more numbers. But in the example, row 2 is same as row 0. So that suggests that the pattern is that every other row is the original, and in between are the spread versions.\n\nSo the rule is: the first row is the original input. The second row is the spread of the first row. The third row is the same as the first. The fourth is the same as the second. And so on. So the output alternates between the original and spread rows.\n\nBut then, how does this apply when the input has multiple rows? Wait, in the training examples, the input is a 6-row grid, but all the input rows after the first are zeros. The output then alternates between original and spread rows. So the input's non-zero rows are only the first, and the rest are generated by this alternation.\n\nSo, the algorithm would be:\n\nFor each row in the input:\n\nIf it's the first row (non-zero), then the output rows alternate between this row and the spread version of it. The number of rows in the output is the same as the input (which in the examples is 6 rows). So for a 6-row input, the output would have rows 0,1,2,3,4,5. Row 0 is original, row 1 is spread, row 2 is original, row 3 spread, row 4 original, row 5 spread.\n\nBut how about when there's more than one non-zero row in the input? Well, in the examples given, all input rows after the first are zero. So perhaps the pattern is that only the first row is used to generate the spread rows, and the other input rows are ignored. Because in the test input, the first row has non-zero elements, and the rest are zero. So the output should be generated by taking the first input row, and creating alternating rows of original and spread versions, for as many rows as given in the input (which in the test case is 6 rows).\n\nNow, for the spread process: each non-zero element in the original row is replaced by two copies of itself, one to the left and one to the right. The original position becomes zero. Wait, no. Wait in example 0's row 0: [0,2,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0]. The spread row (row 1) is [2,0,2,0,8,0,8,0,0,0]. So the 2 at position 1 in row 0 is replaced by 2s at positions 0 and 2 in row 1. The 8 at position 5 is replaced by 8s at positions 4 and 6. So for each non-zero element at position i in the original row, in the spread row, the positions i-1 and i+1 are set to the same value, and position i is set to zero. But in the spread row, other positions remain zero unless modified by this rule.\n\nSo the spread operation is: for each element in the original row, if it's non-zero, split it into left and right, setting those positions in the next row. All other positions are zero unless they're set by this spread.\n\nSo for the test input, the first row is [0,0,3,0,0,0,6,0,0,7,0,0]. The non-zero elements are at positions 2 (3), 6 (6), and 9 (7). \n\nSo the spread row would have:\n\nFor position 2 (3): left is 1, right is 3. So positions 1 and 3 are set to 3.\n\nFor position 6 (6): left is 5, right is 7. Positions 5 and 7 set to 6.\n\nFor position 9 (7): left is 8, right is 10. Positions 8 and 10 set to 7.\n\nSo the spread row would be:\n\n[0,3,0,3,0,6,0,6,7,0,7,0]\n\nBut wait, let's check that. Let's take each non-zero in the original row:\n\nOriginal indexes (0-based):\n\n2: 3 \u2192 spread to 1 and 3 \u2192 set 3 at 1 and 3.\n\n6:6 \u2192 spread to 5 and 7 \u2192 6 at 5 and 7.\n\n9:7 \u2192 spread to 8 and 10 \u21927 at 8 and 10.\n\nSo the spread row would be:\n\n0,3,0,3,0,6,0,6,7,0,7,0.\n\nSo in the spread row, those positions are filled, and others are zero.\n\nThen the next row (row 2) would be the original again: [0,0,3,0,0,0,6,0,0,7,0,0].\n\nRow 3 would be the spread row again, same as row 1.\n\nRow 4: original.\n\nRow5: spread.\n\nSo the output would be:\n\nRow0: original.\n\nRow1: spread.\n\nRow2: original.\n\nRow3: spread.\n\nRow4: original.\n\nRow5: spread.\n\nSo putting it all together, the output would be:\n\nRow0: [0,0,3,0,0,0,6,0,0,7,0,0]\n\nRow1: [0,3,0,3,0,6,0,6,7,0,7,0]\n\nRow2: same as row0\n\nRow3: same as row1\n\nRow4: same as row0\n\nRow5: same as row1\n\nSo that's the pattern. Let me check with the training examples again.\n\nIn Example 1, input first row is [0,4,0,0,0,0,0]. Spread row would be [4,0,4,0,0,0,0], which matches the output. Then rows alternate.\n\nYes, that seems to fit. So the test case should follow this pattern. The output will have the first row as the input row, then the spread version, then repeat.\n\nSo the test input has 6 rows. The output rows 0,2,4 are the original input row. Rows 1,3,5 are the spread version. Each non-zero in the original row is split into left and right in the spread row.\n\nLet me verify the spread row calculation again for the test input.\n\nOriginal row: [0,0,3,0,0,0,6,0,0,7,0,0]\n\nIndices: 0:0, 1:0, 2:3, 3:0, 4:0,5:0,6:6,7:0,8:0,9:7,10:0,11:0.\n\nSo non-zero at 2,6,9.\n\nFor 2 (3): left is 1, right is 3 \u2192 set 3 at 1 and 3.\n\nFor 6 (6): left 5, right 7 \u2192 set 6 at 5 and7.\n\nFor 9 (7): left 8, right10 \u2192 set7 at8 and10.\n\nThus the spread row becomes:\n\n[0, 3, 0, 3, 0, 6, 0, 6, 7, 0, 7, 0]\n\nWait, but the indexes are zero-based. Let's list each position:\n\nIndex 0: 0\n\nIndex1:3 (from 2's left)\n\nIndex2:0 (original 3 is split into 1 and3)\n\nIndex3:3 (from 2's right)\n\nIndex4:0\n\nIndex5:6 (from6's left)\n\nIndex6:0 (original 6 split into5 and7)\n\nIndex7:6 (from6's right)\n\nIndex8:7 (from9's left, since 9-1=8)\n\nIndex9:0 (original 7 split into8 and10)\n\nIndex10:7 (from9's right, 9+1=10)\n\nIndex11:0\n\nSo the spread row is [0,3,0,3,0,6,0,6,7,0,7,0]\n\nYes. So the first spread row is that.\n\nThus, the output for the test input is:\n\nRow0: original\n\nRow1: [0,3,0,3,0,6,0,6,7,0,7,0]\n\nRow2: original\n\nRow3: same as row1\n\nRow4: original\n\nRow5: same as row1\n\nSo that's the expected output."
