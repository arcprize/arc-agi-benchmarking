        "cot_1": "Okay, let's look at these examples and try to figure out the pattern. The input is a list of lists (rows), and the output is another list of lists. The first step is to compare the inputs and outputs to see what's changing.\n\nStarting with Example 0. The input has several rows with numbers and zeros. The output seems to have the non-zero numbers shifted in some way. Let me look closer. For instance, the input row [0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0] becomes [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0] in the output. Wait, but other rows like [0,5,5,5,5,5,5] become [0,0,0,0,0,2,2] in the output? Wait, no. Wait the output for example 0's fifth row is [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2]. Hmm, maybe not. Let me check again.\n\nWait, maybe the non-zero blocks are being moved down, but sorted in a certain way. Let me look at the input and output for example 0. The input has rows like [6,6,6,6,6,0,0] which in the output becomes [0,0,0,4,4,4,4]. Wait, no, in the output, row 7 is [0, 0, 6,6,6,6,6]. Oh right, so the 6's are moved down. Similarly, the row [0,5,5,5,5,5,5] in input becomes [0,5,5,5,5,5,5] in the output but moved to a lower row. Wait, in example 0's input, the 5's row is [0,5,5,5,5,5,5], and in the output, this row is at position 8 (0-indexed maybe?), but the output row 8 is [0,5,5,5,5,5,5]. Wait, but the output for example 0's row 4 is [0,0,0,0,0,2,2]. Where did the 2's come from? The input's first row is [0,2,2,0,0,0,0], which in the output becomes all zeros. Hmm, maybe the non-zero elements are shifted to the bottom, but grouped by their values and arranged in some order.\n\nLooking at example 1's input. The input has rows like [0,0,0,1], which in the output becomes [0,0,0,0] in row 0, but [0,0,0,1] is in row 3. Similarly, the row [2,2,2,0] in input becomes [0,2,2,2] in row 5 of the output. The row [0,3,3,0] becomes [0,0,3,3] in row 4. So the non-zero numbers are moving down, and their positions are adjusted. It seems like each non-zero block is being shifted down as much as possible, but perhaps ordered by their value. Wait, in example 0's output, the numbers are 3, 2, 1, 4, 6,5,8. Wait, maybe sorted in ascending order, but placed in the lower rows. Let's check:\n\nExample 0's output has non-zero rows starting from the bottom. The last row is 8's, then 5's, then 6's, then 4's, then 1's, 2's, etc. Wait the order in the output for example 0 is:\n\n[8,8...], then [0,5...], then [0,0,6...], then [0,0,0,4...], then [0,0,0,0,0,2,2], then [0,0,0,0,1,1,1], etc. Wait the numbers in the output rows (from bottom up) are 8,5,6,4,2,1,3. Hmm, maybe not sorted. Alternatively, perhaps each non-zero block is moved down as far as possible, but arranged such that higher value numbers are lower. Wait 8 is the highest, then 6, then 5, then 4, etc. Let's see:\n\nIn example 0's output, the non-zero rows are:\n\nRow 9: 8s (highest)\n\nRow 8: 5s (next)\n\nRow 7: 6s (higher than 5?)\n\nWait, 6 is higher than 5, but 6 is in row 7, which is above row 8. Hmm, maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps the order is determined by the original positions. Alternatively, maybe each non-zero row is shifted down as far as possible, but in the order of their original positions. Wait, maybe the non-zero blocks are \"falling\" to the bottom, but in the order of their original positions. But that's not matching. Let's think again.\n\nAnother approach: look at each column. Let's check example 2. The input is:\n\nRow 0: [2,2,0]\n\nRow 1: [0,4,0]\n\nRow 2: [8,8,8]\n\nThe output is:\n\nRow 0: [0,0,4]\n\nRow 1: [0,2,2]\n\nRow 2: [8,8,8]\n\nSo, looking at column 1: in input, 2 (row0),4(row1),8(row2). In output, column 1 is 0 (row0), 2 (row1),8 (row2). So 4 is moved to the top of column 2. Wait, maybe the non-zero numbers in each column are sorted in ascending order, with zeros above. Wait, in column 0 of example 2's input: 2,0,8. In output column 0: 0,0,8. So sorted in ascending order, zeros on top. Column 1: 2,4,8 becomes 0 (from row0?), 2,4? No, output row 0 column 2 is 4. Wait, the output is:\n\nRow0: [0,0,4]\n\nRow1: [0,2,2]\n\nRow2: [8,8,8]\n\nSo column 0: [0,0,8] (sorted). Column1: [0,2,8] (but input column1 is 2,4,8. So sorted in ascending order, but 4 is in column2? Wait, no. Wait in column1 of the input, values are row0:2, row1:4, row2:8. The output's column1 is row0:0, row1:2, row2:8. So the 4 is missing. Wait that can't be. Wait maybe I'm misunderstanding the columns.\n\nWait in example 2's input:\n\nOriginal rows:\n\nRow0: [2,2,0]\n\nRow1: [0,4,0]\n\nRow2: [8,8,8]\n\nOutput:\n\nRow0: [0,0,4]\n\nRow1: [0,2,2]\n\nRow2: [8,8,8]\n\nSo column0 in output: 0,0,8. Input column0 was 2,0,8. So sorted in ascending order (0,0,2,8?), but perhaps the non-zero numbers in each column are sorted in ascending order, but placed at the bottom, with zeros filling the rest. Wait column0 input: [2,0,8]. If sorted ascending, [0,2,8], but in output, column0 is [0,0,8]. Hmm, that's not matching.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for each column, the non-zero elements are moved to the bottom of the column, maintaining their order. For example, in example 2's column0:\n\nInput has 2,0,8. Non-zero elements are 2 and8. Moving them to the bottom of the column would give [0,2,8]. But in output, column0 is [0,0,8]. So that doesn't fit. Alternatively, the non-zero elements are sorted in descending order and placed at the bottom. So for column0: 2 and8 sorted descendingly as 8,2, then placed at the bottom. So column0 would be [0,8,2]. But the output's column0 is [0,0,8]. Hmm, not matching.\n\nWait maybe each column is being processed by taking all the non-zero numbers, sorting them in ascending order, and placing them at the bottom of the column, with zeros above. Let's check example 2's columns.\n\nTake column0: input is 2,0,8. Non-zero numbers are 2,8. Sorting in ascending gives 2,8. Place them at the bottom. So the column would be [0,2,8]. But output column0 is [0,0,8]. So that's not matching.\n\nWait example 2's output for column2: input row0 has 0, row1 has 0, row2 has 8. Output row0 has4, row1 has2, row2 has8. Wait maybe I'm looking at the wrong columns. Let's see:\n\nIn example2's input:\n\nRow0: [2,2,0]\n\nRow1: [0,4,0]\n\nRow2: [8,8,8]\n\nSo columns:\n\nColumn0: 2,0,8 \u2192 in output, column0 is 0 (row0), 0 (row1), 8 (row2). So the 2 is missing here.\n\nHmm, this is confusing. Let's try a different approach. Maybe the pattern is that each row in the output contains the non-zero elements from the input rows, but shifted to the right and stacked such that higher numbers are towards the bottom. Wait in example0's output, the non-zero rows start from the bottom. The highest number is 8, then 5, then6, then4, then1,2,3. Wait maybe sorted in ascending order with 8 at the bottom, but that's not exactly the case. For example, the row with 5 is above 6. But 5 is smaller than 6. So perhaps the order is based on the original input's order. Alternatively, maybe each non-zero row in the input is shifted down as much as possible, but sorted by their values. \n\nAnother idea: perhaps the transformation is that each \"block\" (contiguous non-zero numbers in a row) is moved down by the number of zeros below them in their column. Wait, maybe not. Let's look at example2:\n\nIn the input, row0 has [2,2,0], row1 has [0,4,0], row2 has [8,8,8].\n\nIn the output:\n\nRow0: [0,0,4]\n\nRow1: [0,2,2]\n\nRow2: [8,8,8]\n\nLooking at column1:\n\nInput has 2 (row0),4 (row1),8 (row2). Output has 0 (row0),2 (row1),8 (row2). So the 4 moves to column2, row0. Wait, in the output, the 4 is in column2, row0. That's where the input's row1, column1 (4) is now in column2, row0. That seems odd.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the pattern is that each number is shifted down as far as possible in its column, with zeros above. So for each column, the non-zero numbers fall to the bottom of the column, stacking on top of each other. Let's test this with example2.\n\nTake column0:\n\nInput rows are 2,0,8. So non-zero entries are 2 and 8. If they fall to the bottom, then column0 becomes [0,2,8]. But the output column0 is [0,0,8]. So that's not matching.\n\nTake column1 in example2 input: 2,4,8. If they fall to the bottom, the column would be [0,2,4,8], but the output's column1 is [0,2,8], with 4 moved to column2. So this approach doesn't fit.\n\nAnother angle: looking at the outputs, the non-zero numbers seem to be arranged such that each row in the output has a single non-zero number (except for the bottom row, which might have the highest). Wait in example0's output, the rows with non-zero numbers are:\n\nRow6: 4,4,4,4\n\nRow7: 6,6,6,6,6\n\nRow8:5,5,5,5,5,5\n\nRow9:8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n\nWait, but the output has multiple numbers in some rows, like row4: 0,0,0,0,0,2,2. Hmm. So maybe it's not that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is that each non-zero block in the input is moved to the row equal to their value. For example, if a row has a block of 3s, then they are moved to row3. But looking at example0's input:\n\nIn input example0, there's a row [0,5,5,5,5,5,5]. The output has this moved to row8. But 5 would suggest row5. Not matching. Similarly, the row with 6's in input is moved to row7. So 6 in row7, which doesn't match the value.\n\nAlternatively, the sum of the numbers in each row is considered, and the rows are sorted in a certain way. For example, rows with higher sums are placed lower. Let's check example0's input:\n\nRow with 8's sum is 8*7=56 (highest), then row with5's sum is5*6=30, then row with6's sum is6*5=30, then 4's sum is4*4=16, then 2's sum is2*2=4, etc. So in the output, the rows are ordered by their sum in descending order. So 8's row is at the bottom, then5, then6, then4, then3, then2, then1. But in example0's output, the order is 8,5,6,4, then1,2,3 (but the 3 is in row3). So this might not fit.\n\nAnother idea: the rows are sorted in the output such that the maximum value in each row determines their position. Rows with higher maximum values are placed lower. For example:\n\nIn example0's input:\n\nRow with 8's (max 8) is at the bottom.\n\nThen row with5's (max5), then6's (max6), which is higher than5. Wait no, in the output, row8 is 5's, row7 is6's. So 6 is higher than5, so the row with6's should be below row5's. But in the output, row7 (6's) is above row8 (5's). So that's not matching.\n\nHmm, this is tricky. Let me look for another pattern.\n\nLooking at example1's input:\n\nInput rows:\n\n[0,0,0,1]\n\n[0,0,0,0]\n\n[2,2,2,0]\n\n[0,0,0,0]\n\n[0,3,3,0]\n\n[0,0,0,0]\n\n[8,8,8,8]\n\nOutput:\n\n[0,0,0,0]\n\n[0,0,0,0]\n\n[0,0,0,0]\n\n[0,0,0,1]\n\n[0,0,3,3]\n\n[0,2,2,2]\n\n[8,8,8,8]\n\nThe non-zero rows in input are:\n\nRow0:1\n\nRow2:2's\n\nRow4:3's\n\nRow6:8's.\n\nIn the output, these are ordered as 1 (row3),3 (row4),2 (row5),8 (row6). So the order is 1,3,2,8. Hmm, that's not sorted. But maybe the order is based on the original row positions. For example, the input rows are processed from top to bottom, and each non-zero row is placed in the output such that it's as low as possible but above any previous non-zero rows. Wait, that might not make sense.\n\nWait, looking at example1's output: the non-zero rows are arranged in the order of 1,3,2,8. The original input's non-zero rows were 0 (1's),2 (2's),4 (3's),6 (8's). So the output rows are placed starting from the bottom. The 8's are at the bottom, then 2's, then3's, then1's. But that's not the order of their original row numbers. Alternatively, perhaps the non-zero rows are ordered by their value. 1 comes first, then2, then3, then8. But in the output, the 3's are above the2's. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAnother approach: Maybe each non-zero row in the input is shifted down by the number of zeros below them in their column. For example, a row with a number in a certain column would fall down until they hit another number or the bottom.\n\nIn example2's input:\n\nRow0: [2,2,0]\n\nRow1: [0,4,0]\n\nRow2: [8,8,8]\n\nProcessing each column:\n\nFor column0:\n\nRow0 has 2, row1 has0, row2 has8. The 2 would fall down until it hits the 8. But since row2 is already occupied, the 2 can't move. But in the output, column0's row0 and row1 are zeros, and row2 is8. So the 2 in row0 must have been moved elsewhere. Hmm, this isn't aligning.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the non-zero elements in each column are moved to the bottom of their respective columns. Let's check example2's column0:\n\nInput column0: 2,0,8. Moving to the bottom would mean 0,2,8. But output column0 is0,0,8. So where did the 2 go?\n\nWait perhaps the numbers are sorted within each column in ascending order, with zeros at the top. For example, column0's input is [2,0,8]. Sorting the non-zero elements and placing them at the bottom gives [0,2,8]. But output column0 is [0,0,8]. So maybe that's not it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the numbers in each column are sorted in descending order, with zeros above. For column0: [2,0,8] sorted descendingly would be [8,2,0]. But the output column0 is [0,0,8]. So that's not matching.\n\nWait, maybe the non-zero numbers are collected per column and arranged in ascending order, pushing zeros to the top, but this doesn't fit example2's output.\n\nAlternatively, looking for a pattern across all examples: the output seems to have the non-zero numbers arranged in a way that the highest number is at the bottom, and others above in some order. Let's see:\n\nIn example0's output, the last row is8's. Then above that are5's, then6's, then4's, then1's,2's,3's. The order is 8,5,6,4,3,2,1. Not sorted.\n\nIn example1's output, the last row is8's, then above that is2's, then3's, then1's. So order is8,2,3,1. Again not sorted.\n\nIn example2's output, the last row is8's, then above that is2's, then4's. So 8,2,4. Not sorted.\n\nSo perhaps the highest number is always at the bottom. Then the next highest number is placed above it. For example, in example0's output, after8 comes6, then5, then4, etc. But in example0's output, row8 has5's, row7 has6's. So6 is above5. So that doesn't fit. So that's not the case.\n\nAnother idea: maybe the non-zero rows are sorted in the order of their row numbers in the input. The rows that were higher up in the input are placed higher in the output. But in example0's input, the 8's row is the last in input and remains last in output. The 5's row was at input row4, and in output it's row8 (assuming rows are 0-indexed). So perhaps the rows are sorted in reverse order of their original positions. But that doesn't explain the other rows.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each non-zero row is moved down by the number of rows below it that are all zeros. For example, in example1's input, the row with1's (row0) is followed by a zero row (row1), then a row with2's (row2), then zero row (row3), etc. The row with1's has 5 rows below it (rows1-6), but how many are all zeros? Let's see. The row0 has1's. The rows below it are row1 (all zeros), row2 (2's), row3 (zeros), row4 (3's), row5 (zeros), row6 (8's). So the number of all-zero rows below row0 is row1 and row3 and row5. So three zero rows. So row0's1's would move down by 3 rows. Row0 +3 is row3. Which matches the output where the1's are in row3.\n\nSimilarly, row2 in example1's input (2's) has rows3 (zero), row4 (3's), row5 (zero), row6 (8's). The all-zero rows below are row3 and row5. So two rows. So row2 +2 = row4. But in the output, the2's are in row5. Hmm, that doesn't match.\n\nWait maybe it's the number of consecutive zero rows below. For example, row0 in example1's input (1's) has row1 as zero. Then row2 is non-zero. So consecutive zeros below row0 is 1 (row1). So move down by1 row: row0+1=row1. But in output, it's in row3. So that's not matching.\n\nHmm. Another approach: perhaps the transformation is to shift each non-zero element in a row down as far as possible, but in the order of their original rows. So each non-zero row is moved down past any all-zero rows below it. For example, in example0's input:\n\nThe row with5's (input row4) is followed by a zero row (row5), then non-zero row6 (6's), then row7 (4's), etc. So row4 would move down past row5 (zero), but row6 is non-zero, so it can't go further. So in the output, row4's5's are in row8. Let me check:\n\nInput rows:\n\n[0,5,5,5,5,5,5] is row4.\n\nRows below row4:\n\nrow5: all zeros.\n\nrow6: non-zero (6's)\n\nrow7: non-zero (4's)\n\nrow8: zeros\n\nrow9: non-zero (8's)\n\nSo the all-zero rows below row4 are row5 and row8. So row4 can move down past row5 and row8? But row6 and row7 are non-zero. So row4 can move down to row8 (since rows5 and8 are zeros). But row7 is non-zero. Wait, perhaps the movement is to the first available space. So the row4's5's can't move past row6 and row7. So maybe the rows are moved down as far as possible, moving through any zero rows, but stopping when a non-zero row is encountered.\n\nIn example0's input:\n\nRow0 has2's, followed by row1 (zeros), then row2 (1's), row3 (zeros), row4 (5's), row5 (zeros), row6 (6's), row7 (4's), row8 (zeros), row9 (8's).\n\nSo row0 (2's) can move down past row1 (zero) to row2, but row2 has 1's. So it can't go further. So it stays in row0? But in the output, the 2's row becomes all zeros, and the output has 2's in row4 (index4). Hmm, this isn't adding up.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the entire grid is processed column by column, and in each column, the non-zero elements are moved to the bottom, maintaining their order. For example, in a column, if the elements are [2,0,8], moving non-zero to bottom would give [0,2,8]. But example2's output for column0 is [0,0,8]. So that's not matching.\n\nWait, but in example2's input:\n\nColumn0: [2,0,8]\n\nIf we take non-zero elements 2 and8 and move them to the bottom, maintaining their order: 2 comes before8. So the column would become [0,2,8]. But the output's column0 is [0,0,8]. So where did the 2 go?\n\nAh, maybe the non-zero elements are shifted to the bottom of the entire grid, not per column. For example, all non-zero elements are collected and arranged in some order, then placed at the bottom of the grid, with zeros filling the rest.\n\nLooking at example2:\n\nInput has three non-zero rows:\n\nRow0: 2,2,0\n\nRow1:0,4,0\n\nRow2:8,8,8.\n\nOutput has:\n\nRow0:0,0,4\n\nRow1:0,2,2\n\nRow2:8,8,8.\n\nSo the non-zero numbers are 2,2,4,8,8,8. If we arrange them in the output rows such that each row has a block of a single number, sorted in some order.\n\nIn example2's output:\n\nRow0:4\n\nRow1:2,2\n\nRow2:8,8,8.\n\nSo the numbers are 4,2,8. This is sorted as 2,4,8. So the rows are arranged in ascending order, with each number's block placed in rows from top to bottom. But example2's output has 4 in row0, 2 in row1, which is ascending. But why is the 4 in row0?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the non-zero numbers are sorted in descending order and placed from the bottom up. So the highest number (8) is at the bottom, then next highest (4), then 2. But in example2's output, the 8's are at the bottom, 4 is in row0, and 2's in row1. That doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the non-zero rows are sorted based on the numerical value of the non-zero elements, with higher values at the bottom. So in example0's output, the order is 8,5,6,4, etc. But 5 is less than6, so why is 5 below6?\n\nThis is getting complicated. Let me try to find a different approach. Perhaps the pattern is that each non-zero row is shifted down by the number of rows that are completely zeros below it in the input.\n\nFor example, in example1's input:\n\nThe row with1's (row0) has rows1,2,3,4,5,6 below. Out of these, rows1,3,5 are all zeros. So three zero rows. So shift row0 down by3 to row3. Which matches the output.\n\nThe row with2's (row2) has rows3,4,5,6 below. Zero rows are3 and5. So two zeros. Shift down by2 rows to row4. But in the output, the2's are in row5. So that's off by one.\n\nThe row with3's (row4) has rows5 and6 below. Only row5 is zero. Shift down by1 to row5. But in the output, the3's are in row4. So that doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. Maybe the shift is the number of all-zero rows below. For row0 in example1: 3 zero rows (rows1,3,5). So shift down by3 to row3. Which matches. For row2 in example1, the zero rows below are row3 and row5. So two zero rows. Shift down by2 to row4. But the output's row5 has the2's. So perhaps it's rows below including the current position? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the shift is the number of all-zero rows below the current row. For row2 in example1, the rows below are rows3 (zero), row4 (non-zero), row5 (zero), row6 (non-zero). So the number of zero rows below row2 is two (rows3 and5). So shift down by2 rows. Row2 +2= row4. But the output's row5 has the2's. So that's not matching.\n\nThis approach isn't working. Let's think differently. Let's look at the output in example0. The non-zero rows in the output are ordered as follows (from top to bottom):\n\nRow0: all zeros\n\nRow1: all zeros\n\nRow2: all zeros\n\nRow3: [0,0,0,0,0,0,3]\n\nRow4: [0,0,0,0,0,2,2]\n\nRow5: [0,0,0,0,1,1,1]\n\nRow6: [0,0,0,4,4,4,4]\n\nRow7: [0,0,6,6,6,6,6]\n\nRow8: [0,5,5,5,5,5,5]\n\nRow9: [8,8,...]\n\nSo the non-zero numbers in the output rows are 3,2,1,4,6,5,8. These are in descending order from bottom to top (8,5,6,4,1,2,3). Wait, but 5 comes before6. Hmm. Alternatively, the order is 8,5,6,4, then 1,2,3. Which doesn't follow a clear numerical order. However, 3 is the smallest in that group and is at the top. So maybe the non-zero rows are sorted in ascending order of their numbers, with smaller numbers higher up. But 5 and6 are out of order. 5 is in row8, which is below row7 (6). So that would contradict ascending order.\n\nAlternatively, the order is based on the original positions of the non-zero rows. For example, the row that was originally higher up in the input is placed higher in the output. So in example0's input, the row with3's is row1 (input row1 is [0,0,0,0,3,0,0]). In the output, this row is transformed into row3. So the row is moved down by two rows. But how does that relate to other rows?\n\nThis is getting frustrating. Let's try to find a different approach.\n\nLooking at the input and output of example0:\n\nInput has rows with 2's, 3's,1's,5's,6's,4's,8's.\n\nThe output has these numbers rearranged such that each number's row is determined by their value. For example:\n\n- 8 is in row9 (the last row).\n\n- 5 is in row8 (value5, row8).\n\n-6 is in row7 (value6, row7).\n\n-4 is in row6 (value4, row6).\n\n-3 is in row3 (value3, row3).\n\n-2 is in row4 (value2, row4).\n\n-1 is in row5 (value1, row5).\n\nWait, this seems to be a pattern. For example, the number in the row is equal to the value of the number. So:\n\nRow3 has 3's.\n\nRow4 has 2's.\n\nRow5 has1's.\n\nRow6 has4's.\n\nRow7 has6's.\n\nRow8 has5's.\n\nRow9 has8's.\n\nBut this doesn't align. For example, row6 has4's (value4), which would suggest it's in row4. But row6 is row6. So that doesn't fit. Unless the rows are sorted in reverse order.\n\nWait, maybe the rows are ordered based on the value of the number in the row, with higher values at the bottom. So the largest number (8) is at the bottom, next is6, then5, then4, then3, then2, then1. But in example0's output, the order is8,5,6,4,1,2,3. That's not the correct order.\n\nAlternatively, the rows are sorted in the order of the numbers' values, but each row is placed in the output such that the row number is equal to the total number of rows minus the value. For example, if the value is3, row is total_rows -3. But example0 has 10 rows. So 10-3=7. But 3 is in row3. Doesn't fit.\n\nAnother idea: Perhaps each number is moved down by its value minus one. For example, a 3 would move down3-1=2 rows. Let's test this with example1's input:\n\nRow0 has1's. 1-1=0, so stays in row0. But in the output, the1's are in row3. So that doesn't work.\n\nAlternatively, each number is moved down by its value. For example, a3 would move down3 rows. But that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, the number of rows a block is moved down is equal to its value. For example, in example0's input, the3's row is moved down to row3. Original row1 (3's) +3 = row4. But in output, the3's are in row3. So that's not matching.\n\nHmm. I'm stuck. Maybe I should look for a different pattern. Let's look at the positions of the numbers in the output.\n\nIn example0's output:\n\n- The3's are in row3, column6.\n\n- The2's are in row4, columns5-6.\n\n- The1's are in row5, columns4-6.\n\n- The4's are in row6, columns3-6.\n\n- The6's are in row7, columns2-6.\n\n- The5's are in row8, columns1-6.\n\n- The8's are in row9, columns0-6.\n\nSo each number's block starts at a column that is one less than the previous. Like3 starts at column6,2 at5,1 at4, etc. But why?\n\nWait, the starting column for each block in example0's output seems to be (value -1) modulo columns? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, each number's block is shifted to the right by (number's value -1) positions. For example, the3's are in column6, which is 6 positions from the left. 3-1=2. 6-2=4. Not sure.\n\nAnother observation: in example0's output, the blocks for each number are aligned to the right. The3 is in the last column, 2's are in the fifth and sixth, etc. So the higher the number, the more to the right they are. But in example1's output, the1 is in column3,3's in columns2-3,2's in columns1-3. Again, higher numbers are to the right. Example2's output:4 is in column2,2's in columns1-2,8's in all. So higher numbers are to the right. So perhaps the pattern is that each number's block is shifted right by (max_value - number) positions. For example, in example0, max is8. For number3, max -3=5. So shifted right by5. 3's block is in column6 (7 columns total). Original block for3's in input was at column4 (row1, column4). Shifted right by5 would be column4+5=9, which is beyond the columns. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, the numbers are arranged in descending order, each shifted to the right, with the highest number at the bottom and fully to the left. Example0's 8's are at the bottom, fully to the left. Then5's are shifted right by1, then6's by1, etc. But this is not clear.\n\nMaybe the key is that each non-zero row in the input is transformed into a row in the output where the non-zero elements are shifted to the right, and the entire row is moved down based on the value of the number. For example, a row with3's is moved down3 rows and shifted right3 columns. But example0's3's are in row3, column6. Original row1, column4. So movement down by2 rows and right by2 columns. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the number of digits in the number determines the shift. For example,3 is one digit, so shifted one column. No, in example0's3's are in column6. Doesn't fit.\n\nAt this point, I'm struggling to find a clear pattern. Let's try to find another approach by comparing input and output for each example.\n\nExample0's input has the following non-zero rows (value: row index):\n\n2: row0\n\n3: row1\n\n1: row2\n\n5: row4\n\n6: row6\n\n4: row7\n\n8: row9.\n\nThe output's non-zero rows are:\n\n3: row3\n\n2: row4\n\n1: row5\n\n4: row6\n\n6: row7\n\n5: row8\n\n8: row9.\n\nSo the row indices in the output are in the order3,4,5,6,7,8,9. So the original rows are sorted based on their values, with lower values placed higher up. For example, 1,2,3,4,5,6,8. But the order in the output is3,2,1,4,6,5,8. Which doesn't match sorted order.\n\nWait, but in the output, the order of values from top to bottom is3,2,1,4,6,5,8. This is decreasing from3 to1, then increasing from4 to8. So perhaps the values are ordered in descending order from3 to1, then in ascending order from4 onwards. That seems arbitrary.\n\nAlternatively, the values are arranged based on the original row's position. The original rows are ordered row0, row1, row2, row4, row6, row7, row9. In the output, these are transformed to rows3,4,5,6,7,8,9. So the original row0 (2's) is now in row4, row1 (3's) in row3, row2 (1's) in row5, row4 (5's) in row8, row6 (6's) in row7, row7 (4's) in row6, row9 (8's) stays in row9. \n\nThis suggests that the original row index plus some value equals the output row index. For example:\n\nRow0 (2's) in input becomes row4 in output. So 0+4=4.\n\nRow1 (3's) becomes row3:1+2=3.\n\nRow2 (1's) becomes row5:2+3=5.\n\nRow4 (5's) becomes row8:4+4=8.\n\nRow6 (6's) becomes row7:6+1=7.\n\nRow7 (4's) becomes row6:7-1=6.\n\nRow9 (8's) becomes row9:9+0=9.\n\nNo clear pattern here.\n\nPerhaps the key is to look at the positions of the non-zero elements in the input and how they are arranged in the output. In example0, the output rows have non-zero elements starting from the right, and each higher row has non-zero elements starting one position to the left. For instance:\n\nRow3: last element is3.\n\nRow4: elements5-6 are2's.\n\nRow5: elements4-6 are1's.\n\nRow6: elements3-6 are4's.\n\nRow7: elements2-6 are6's.\n\nRow8: elements1-6 are5's.\n\nRow9: elements0-6 are8's.\n\nSo it's like a pyramid where each higher row has non-zero elements starting one position to the left. The number of elements in each row's block corresponds to the original block's length. For example, the3 in row3 is a single element (original row1 had a single3), the2's in row4 are two elements (original row0 had two2's), the1's in row5 are three elements (original row2 had three1's), the4's in row6 are four elements (original row7 had four4's), the6's in row7 are five elements (original row6 had five6's), the5's in row8 are six elements (original row4 had six5's), and the8's in row9 are seven elements.\n\nSo the pattern seems to be:\n\nFor each non-zero block in the input, in the output:\n\n- The block is moved to a row determined by the size of the block. The number of elements in the block determines the row. For example:\n\n- 1-element block (3) \u2192 row3.\n\n- 2-element block (2's) \u2192 row4.\n\n- 3-element block (1's) \u2192 row5.\n\n-4-element block (4's) \u2192 row6.\n\n-5-element block (6's) \u2192 row7.\n\n-6-element block (5's) \u2192 row8.\n\n-7-element block (8's) \u2192 row9.\n\nThis matches the example0's output rows. So the row index in the output is determined by the number of elements in the block. For example, a block with k elements is placed in row (k + 2). Wait, for the3 in example0, which has1 element, it's placed in row3. So 1 + 2=3. 2 elements \u21924 (2+2=4). 3 elements \u21925 (3+2=5). 4 elements\u21926 (4+2=6). 5 elements\u21927 (5+2=7). 6 elements\u21928 (6+2=8). 7 elements\u21929 (7+2=9). Yes, that seems to fit.\n\nLet's check example1:\n\nInput non-zero blocks:\n\n- row0:1 element (1) \u2192 output row3 (1+2=3).\n\n- row2:3 elements (2's) \u2192 output row5 (3+2=5).\n\n- row4:2 elements (3's) \u2192 output row4 (2+2=4). Wait, but in example1's output, the3's are in row4, which is 2+2=4. Yes.\n\n- row6:4 elements (8's) \u2192 output row6 (4+2=6? But row6 is the last row. Wait in example1's output, the8's are in row6. 4+2=6. Yes.\n\nSo this pattern holds.\n\nExample2's input:\n\n- row0:2 elements (2's) \u2192 output row4 (2+2=4). But in example2's output, the2's are in row1. Hmm, this doesn't fit. Wait example2's output has the2's in row1. So the pattern breaks here.\n\nWait, example2's input has:\n\nRow0:2 elements (2's) \u2192 expected output row4 (2+2=4), but output row1.\n\nRow1:1 element (4) \u2192 output row0 (1+2=3?), but in output, the4 is in row0. So this doesn't fit.\n\nHmm, maybe my previous assumption is incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, the row index in the output is determined by the length of the block. For example, block of length l is placed in row (total_rows - l). In example0, there are10 rows. A block of length7 (8's) is in row9 (10-7=3? No). Doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, row index = (max_row_index) - (block_length -1). In example0, max_row_index is9. For the block of7 (8's):9 - (7-1) =9-6=3. No, output row9.\n\nThis doesn't work.\n\nAlternatively, the row in the output is determined by the block's value. For example, a block of valuev is placed in row (v-1). In example0's3's are in row3 (3-1=2? No). Doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. Let's re-examine example2's output. The input has:\n\nRow0:2 elements (2's).\n\nRow1:1 element (4).\n\nRow2:3 elements (8's).\n\nThe output has:\n\nRow0:1 element (4).\n\nRow1:2 elements (2's).\n\nRow2:3 elements (8's).\n\nSo the blocks are sorted in ascending order of their values. 4 is higher than2, but in the output,4 is in row0, and2's in row1. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, the blocks are sorted in ascending order of their values, and placed from the bottom up. But in example2's output, the8's are at the bottom, then2's, then4's. Which is sorted descendingly. So that's not the case.\n\nThis is very confusing. Maybe I should look for another pattern. Let's consider that the output is the input where each non-zero row is moved down by the number of elements in the block. For example:\n\nIn example0's row0 has2 elements. So move down by2 rows. Original row0 +2 = row2. But in the output, this row becomes all zeros, and the2's are in row4. So no.\n\nAnother Idea:\n\nThe output rows seem to have the non-zero elements shifted to the right and arranged in a way that each row's non-zero elements are aligned to the right of the previous row's non-zero elements. For example, in example0's output:\n\nRow3: ...3\n\nRow4: ..2,2\n\nRow5: .1,1,1\n\nRow6:4,4,4,4\n\nRow7:6,6,6,6,6\n\nRow8:5,5,5,5,5,5\n\nRow9:8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n\nEach row's non-zero elements start one column to the left of the previous row's start. This creates a right-aligned staircase pattern. The number of elements in each row's block seems to correspond to the value of the number. For example:\n\n- Row3 has1 element (3).\n\n- Row4 has2 elements (2's).\n\n- Row5 has3 elements (1's).\n\n- Row6 has4 elements (4's).\n\n- Row7 has5 elements (6's).\n\n- Row8 has6 elements (5's).\n\n- Row9 has7 elements (8's).\n\nSo the number of elements in each block is equal to the value of the number. But in example0, the3's block has1 element, but3 is the value. 2's block has2 elements, 1's block has3 elements, etc. This doesn't match. 3 has1 element, which is not equal to3. So this idea is incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, the value of the number determines the number of elements in the block. For example, value3 has3 elements. But in example0's output,3 has1 element. So no.\n\nAnother Idea: The number of elements in the block plus the value of the number equals the number of columns. For example, in example0's output, the3's block has1 element. 3+1=4, but columns are7. Doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, the starting column of the block is determined by the value. For example, value3 starts at column6 (7-1). Value2 starts at column5 (7-2). Value1 starts at column4 (7-3). Value4 starts at column3 (7-4=3). Value6 starts at column2 (7-5=2). Value5 starts at column1 (7-6=1). Value8 starts at column0 (7-7=0). This seems to fit. Let's check:\n\nExample0's output:\n\n3's block in row3 starts at column6 (7-3-1=3? No. Wait 7 columns. For value3, 7-3=4. No. Or 7- (3's position +1) =6. Maybe the starting column is (number of columns) - (value + number of elements -1). For example, in row3, value3 has1 element. columns=7. 7 - (3 +1-1) =7-3=4. No, but the3 is in column6.\n\nAlternatively, the starting column is (number of columns - value). For example, value3:7-3=4. But in row3, the3 is in column6. Doesn't fit.\n\nThis is getting me nowhere. Let's try to think of the test input and see what the expected output would be based on the examples.\n\nTest input:\n\n[6,6,6,0,0,0,0,0]\n\n[0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1]\n\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\n[0,4,4,4,4,4,0,0]\n\n[0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0]\n\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\n[2,2,2,2,2,2,2,0]\n\n[0,0,3,3,3,3,3,3]\n\n[0,9,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\n[8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8]\n\nThe non-zero rows are:\n\nRow0:6's (3 elements)\n\nRow1:1's (4 elements)\n\nRow3:4's (5 elements)\n\nRow4:7's (2 elements)\n\nRow6:2's (7 elements)\n\nRow7:3's (6 elements)\n\nRow8:9 (1 element)\n\nRow10:8's (8 elements)\n\nAssuming the pattern from example0 and example1, where each non-zero block is placed in a row determined by the number of elements in the block plus a certain offset. From example0 and example1, the row in the output seems to be (number of elements in the block) + 2. For example:\n\n- In example0's row0 (2 elements) \u2192 row4 (2+2=4).\n\n- In example1's row0 (1 element) \u2192 row3 (1+2=3).\n\n- In example1's row4 (2 elements) \u2192 row4 (2+2=4).\n\nSo applying this to the test input's blocks:\n\nRow0:3 elements \u21923+2=5 \u2192 row5.\n\nRow1:4 elements \u21924+2=6 \u2192 row6.\n\nRow3:5 elements \u21925+2=7 \u2192 row7.\n\nRow4:2 elements \u21922+2=4 \u2192 row4.\n\nRow6:7 elements \u21927+2=9 \u2192 row9.\n\nRow7:6 elements \u21926+2=8 \u2192 row8.\n\nRow8:1 element \u21921+2=3 \u2192 row3.\n\nRow10:8 elements \u21928+2=10 \u2192 but the test input has 11 rows (0-10). So row10+2=12, which is beyond. But perhaps this is a problem. Alternatively, maybe the formula is (number of elements) -1 + row offset. Or something else.\n\nBut let's proceed with this assumption. So the blocks in the test input would be placed as follows:\n\n- 3-element block (6's) \u2192 row5.\n\n-4-element block (1's) \u2192 row6.\n\n-5-element block (4's) \u2192 row7.\n\n-2-element block (7's) \u2192 row4.\n\n-7-element block (2's) \u2192 row9.\n\n-6-element block (3's) \u2192 row8.\n\n-1-element block (9) \u2192 row3.\n\n-8-element block (8's) \u2192 row10 (8+2=10).\n\nThen, the non-zero rows would be arranged from row3 up to row10, with higher rows containing smaller block sizes.\n\nBut how are the elements arranged within each row? From the examples, it seems like each block is aligned to the right, with zeros to the left. The number of elements in the block determines how far to the right they start. For example:\n\nIn example0's output, the3's block (1 element) is at column6.\n\nThe2's block (2 elements) starts at column5.\n\nThe1's block (3 elements) starts at column4.\n\nSo for a block with k elements, it starts at column (number of columns - k).\n\nIn example0's input, there are7 columns. So for a block of size k, start at column7-k.\n\nTest input has8 columns. So for a block of size k, start at column8 -k.\n\nSo:\n\n-6's block (3 elements) in row5: starts at column8-3=5. So positions5,6,7.\n\n-1's block (4 elements) in row6: starts at column8-4=4. positions4-7.\n\n-4's block (5 elements) in row7: starts at column8-5=3. positions3-7.\n\n-7's block (2 elements) in row4: starts at column8-2=6. positions6-7.\n\n-2's block (7 elements) in row9: starts at8-7=1. positions1-7.\n\n-3's block (6 elements) in row8: starts at8-6=2. positions2-7.\n\n-9's block (1 element) in row3: starts at8-1=7. position7.\n\n-8's block (8 elements) in row10: starts at8-8=0. positions0-7.\n\nSo the output rows would be:\n\nRow3: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,9]\n\nRow4: [0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0] \u2192 but according to the pattern, it should be zeros except for7's starting at column6. But the input row4 has7's in positions5-6. In the output, according to this pattern, row4 should have7's starting at column6. So output row4 would be [0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7].\n\nRow5:6's starting at5: [0,0,0,0,0,6,6,6]\n\nRow6:1's starting at4: [0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1]\n\nRow7:4's starting at3: [0,0,0,4,4,4,4,4]\n\nRow8:3's starting at2: [0,0,3,3,3,3,3,3]\n\nRow9:2's starting at1: [0,2,2,2,2,2,2,2]\n\nRow10:8's: [8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8]\n\nThe other rows (0,1,2,5, etc.) would be all zeros.\n\nBut we also need to consider the order of the rows. According to the assumed pattern, the rows are ordered based on the block size (smallest to largest), but according to example0 and example1, the order is from smallest block size at the top to largest at the bottom. So in example0, the blocks are size1 (3), size2 (2), size3 (1), size4 (4), size5 (6), size6 (5), size7 (8). But the output rows are ordered as3,2,1,4,6,5,8. Which doesn't follow the size order. So this suggests that the ordering is not based on block size but perhaps the value of the number.\n\nAlternatively, the rows are ordered based on the value of the number in the block, from smallest to largest, with each block's row determined by its size. So for example, in example0, the values are3,2,1,4,6,5,8. Ordered as1,2,3,4,5,6,8. So the rows are ordered by the value, with each row's position determined by the block size. But this doesn't align.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and the lack of a clear pattern, I'll proceed with the assumption that each non-zero block is moved to a row determined by the number of elements in the block plus 2, and within the row, the block starts at column (total_columns - block_size). Then, arrange the rows in the output from top to bottom in the order of their block sizes (smallest to largest), with ties broken by the value of the number.\n\nApplying this to the test input:\n\nBlocks:\n\n-9's (1 element) \u2192 row3 (1+2=3), starts at column7.\n\n-7's (2 elements) \u2192 row4 (2+2=4), starts at column6.\n\n-6's (3 elements) \u2192 row5 (3+2=5), starts at column5.\n\n-1's (4 elements) \u2192 row6 (4+2=6), starts at column4.\n\n-4's (5 elements) \u2192 row7 (5+2=7), starts at column3.\n\n-3's (6 elements) \u2192 row8 (6+2=8), starts at column2.\n\n-2's (7 elements) \u2192 row9 (7+2=9), starts at column1.\n\n-8's (8 elements) \u2192 row10 (8+2=10), starts at column0.\n\nNow, the order of the rows in the output would be based on the block sizes. But the block sizes are1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So the rows would be ordered from smallest to largest block size. But example0's output has the blocks ordered1,2,3,4,5,6,7. But example0's row3 has1-element block (3), row4 has2-element (2), row5 has3-element (1), etc. So the order is3,2,1,4,5,6,7. Which is not based on block size but perhaps the value. \n\nAlternatively, the rows are ordered based on the value of the block's number in ascending order. For the test input:\n\nBlocks have numbers9,7,6,1,4,3,2,8. Ordered ascendingly:1,2,3,4,6,7,8,9. So their corresponding rows would be:\n\n1: row6 (4 elements).\n\n2: row9 (7 elements).\n\n3: row8 (6 elements).\n\n4: row7 (5 elements).\n\n6: row5 (3 elements).\n\n7: row4 (2 elements).\n\n8: row10 (8 elements).\n\n9: row3 (1 element).\n\nSo the output rows would be ordered from top to bottom as:\n\n row3 (9), row4 (7), row5 (6), row6 (1), row7 (4), row8 (3), row9 (2), row10 (8).\n\nSo the output rows are:\n\nrow3: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,9]\n\nrow4: [0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7]\n\nrow5: [0,0,0,0,0,6,6,6]\n\nrow6: [0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1]\n\nrow7: [0,0,0,4,4,4,4,4]\n\nrow8: [0,0,3,3,3,3,3,3]\n\nrow9: [0,2,2,2,2,2,2,2]\n\nrow10: [8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8]\n\nThe remaining rows (0,1,2,5) would be all zeros.\n\nSo the final output would be:\n\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,9]\n\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7]\n\n[0,0,0,0,0,6,6,6]\n\n[0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1]\n\n[0,0,0,4,4,4,4,4]\n\n[0,0,3,3,3,3,3,3]\n\n[0,2,2,2,2,2,2,2]\n\n[8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8]\n\nBut I'm not entirely confident this is correct, but given the time constraints, I'll proceed with this as the answer.",

        "cot_2": "Okay, let's tackle this puzzle. I need to figure out the pattern that transforms the input lists into the output lists based on the training examples. Let's start by looking closely at the examples to see what's happening.\n\nLooking at Example 0's input and output:\n\nThe input has several rows with numbers and zeros. The output seems to have rearranged these numbers. Let me compare them row by row.\n\nOriginal Input (Example 0):\nRow 0: [0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0]\nRow 1: [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0]\nRow 2: [1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]\nRow 3: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\nRow 4: [0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5]\nRow 5: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\nRow 6: [6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0]\nRow 7: [0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4]\nRow 8: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\nRow 9: [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8]\n\nOutput:\nRow 0: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\nRow 1: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\nRow 2: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\nRow 3: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3]\nRow 4: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2]\nRow 5: [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1]\nRow 6: [0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4]\nRow 7: [0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6]\nRow 8: [0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5]\nRow 9: [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8]\n\nHmm, I notice that the non-zero numbers seem to be shifted downward in some way. For instance, the row with 3 in the input (row 1) ends up in row 3 of the output, but shifted to the end. Similarly, the 2s from row 0 move to row 4, shifted to the right. The 1s from row 2 go to row 5. The 5s in row 4 of input are now in row 8 of output. The 6s from row 6 input are in row7 output. The 4s from row7 input end up in row6 output. And the 8s stay the same.\n\nWait, maybe the rows are being reversed in order, but not exactly. Let's see the order of the output rows. The 8s stay at the bottom. Then the row with 5s is now above them, then 6s, then 4s, then 1s, then 2s, then 3. The original input rows with numbers are in rows 0,1,2,4,6,7,9. The output rows with numbers start from row3 upwards. So perhaps the non-zero rows are being sorted in ascending order based on their value and then stacked from the bottom up, but keeping the original bottom row (8s) fixed.\n\nWait, in the output of example0, the numbers in the non-zero rows are 3,2,1,4,6,5,8. Wait, but the original numbers in input were 2,3,1,5,6,4,8. Hmm, maybe the numbers are sorted in ascending order and placed in rows starting from the bottom, except the 8s which are already at the bottom. Let me check the values:\n\nThe numbers present in input (non-zero) are 1,2,3,4,5,6,8. In the output, starting from the bottom up (excluding the bottom 8s):\n\nRow8:5, row7:6, row6:4, row5:1, row4:2, row3:3. Wait, no, that's 5,6,4,1,2,3. That doesn't sort in any obvious order. Alternatively, maybe the numbers are ordered based on their value, with higher numbers lower in the output. Let's see:\n\n8 is at the bottom. Then 5, then 6, then4, then 1, then2, then3. But 5 is higher than 6, which doesn't fit. Hmm, maybe not.\n\nAnother approach: perhaps each non-zero row in the input is shifted down by a certain number of rows, and the zeros are filled in. But how much?\n\nLooking at row0 in input (2s) becomes row4 in output. That's a shift of 4 rows down. Input row1 (3) becomes row3, shift of 2 down. Input row2 (1s) becomes row5, shift of 3 down. Input row4 (5s) becomes row8, shift of 4 down. Input row6 (6s) becomes row7, shift of 1 up. Input row7 (4s) becomes row6, shift of 1 up. Hmm, that's inconsistent. Maybe not shifts.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the non-zero blocks are moved to the bottom of the grid, sorted by their numeric value. Wait, in example0's output, the 3 is in row3, then 2 in row4, 1 in row5, 4 in row6, 6 in row7, 5 in row8. But 1,2,3,4,5,6. But the order in the output is 3,2,1,4,6,5. That's 3 at the top, then 2, then1, then4, then6, then5. Not sorted. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe the non-zero rows are being sorted based on their numeric value in ascending order and then placed in the output from the bottom up, but with the highest number (8) remaining at the bottom. Let's see:\n\nNumbers are 1,2,3,4,5,6,8. Sorted ascending:1,2,3,4,5,6,8. So the output should have 8 at bottom, then6,5,4,3,2,1. But in the output of example0, the order from bottom up (excluding 8) is 5,6,4,1,2,3. Which doesn't match. So that's not it.\n\nWait, maybe it's the length of the non-zero sequence. For example, in input row0: [0,2,2,0,0,0,0]. The non-zero part is two 2s. Input row1: [0,0,0,0,3,0,0] \u2014 one 3. Row2: three 1s. Row4: six 5s. Row6: five 6s. Row7: four 4s. Row9: seven 8s.\n\nIn the output, the rows with numbers are:\n\nRow3: 3 (length 1)\n\nRow4: two 2s (length 2)\n\nRow5: three 1s (length3)\n\nRow6: four 4s (length4)\n\nRow7: five 6s (length5)\n\nRow8: six 5s (length6)\n\nRow9: seven 8s (length7)\n\nAh! Wait, the length of the non-zero sequences in the input rows are:\n\nRow0: 2 (two 2s)\n\nRow1: 1 (one 3)\n\nRow2: 3 (three 1s)\n\nRow4:6 (six 5s)\n\nRow6:5 (five 6s)\n\nRow7:4 (four 4s)\n\nRow9:7 (seven 8s)\n\nBut in the output, the rows are arranged such that the number of elements in the non-zero block (the length) corresponds to the row's position. For example:\n\nRow3:3 \u2014 but the length here is 1 (3 is a single element in the output row3). Wait, that doesn't fit.\n\nWait, perhaps the output rows are ordered such that the number of elements in the non-zero block (the length) increases as we go down. Let me check:\n\nIn example0's output, the rows with non-zero blocks:\n\nRow3: [0,0,0,0,0,0,3] \u2014 non-zero length 1\n\nRow4: [0,0,0,0,0,2,2] \u2014 length 2\n\nRow5: [0,0,0,0,1,1,1] \u2014 length3\n\nRow6: [0,0,0,4,4,4,4] \u2014 length4\n\nRow7: [0,0,6,6,6,6,6] \u2014 length5\n\nRow8: [0,5,5,5,5,5,5] \u2014 length6\n\nRow9: all 8s \u2014 length7\n\nSo the rows are arranged such that the length of the non-zero block (from the input) is ordered in ascending order, but placed from the bottom up. Wait, but in the output, the lengths are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7. So the rows are ordered by the length of their non-zero sequence in the input. The row in the input with the shortest non-zero block is placed higher up in the output, with longer sequences placed lower. But in example0's input, the lengths of the non-zero blocks are:\n\nRow0: 2 (2s)\n\nRow1:1 (3)\n\nRow2:3 (1s)\n\nRow4:6 (5s)\n\nRow6:5 (6s)\n\nRow7:4 (4s)\n\nRow9:7 (8s)\n\nSo the order of lengths is 1,2,3,4,5,6,7. So in the output, the rows are ordered by the length of their non-zero blocks from shortest to longest. The 8s in row9 are already the longest (7) so they stay at the bottom. Then the 5s (length6) in row8, 6s (length5) in row7, 4s (length4) in row6, 1s (length3) in row5, 2s (length2) in row4, and 3 (length1) in row3. Wait, but in the output, the order is:\n\nRow3:3 (length1)\n\nRow4:2s (length2)\n\nRow5:1s (length3)\n\nRow6:4s (length4)\n\nRow7:6s (length5)\n\nRow8:5s (length6)\n\nRow9:8s (length7)\n\nSo the order is sorted by the length of the non-zero block in the input, from shortest (1) to longest (7). That makes sense. But how does this transformation happen?\n\nSo the pattern seems to be: For each row in the input, if it has a non-zero block (consecutive or not?), the length of the non-zero elements (maybe count the number of non-zero elements in the row) determines the row's position in the output. The rows are sorted in ascending order of their non-zero element count. The rows with the same count might be ordered by their numeric value, but in example0, the 5s (length6) are after the 6s (length5). So the order is purely based on the length of the non-zero elements.\n\nWait, but in example0, the row with 3 (length1) is placed in row3 of the output, then the row with 2 (length2) in row4, etc. So the output rows are arranged such that the row with non-zero count N is placed in the (original number of rows - N) position? Not exactly. Let's see:\n\nIn example0's input, there are 10 rows. The output also has 10 rows. The 8s are in row9 (same as input). The 5s (length6) are in row8. The 6s (length5) in row7. The 4s (length4) in row6. The 1s (length3) in row5. The 2s (length2) in row4. The 3 (length1) in row3. The rest are zeros.\n\nSo the order is: the higher the length of non-zero elements in the input row, the lower the row is placed in the output. So rows are sorted in ascending order of their non-zero count, but placed from the bottom up. The row with the largest non-zero count (8s, count7) is at the bottom. Then the next largest (5s, count6) above that, and so on. The rows with zero count (all zeros) are filled at the top.\n\nBut wait, in example0's input, there are rows with all zeros (like row3, row5, row8). In the output, those rows are filled with zeros, but in the output, the non-zero rows start from row3 upwards. So the zero rows are left at the top, and the non-zero rows are arranged below them based on their non-zero count.\n\nSo the algorithm would be:\n\n1. For each row in the input, calculate the number of non-zero elements in that row. Let's call this count.\n\n2. Sort all the non-zero rows (those with count>0) in ascending order of their count. If two rows have the same count, maybe their order is preserved as per their original position, but need to check examples.\n\n3. Place these sorted rows starting from the bottom of the output grid. The row with the largest count (highest count) is placed at the very bottom. Then the next largest above it, and so on. Wait, no, in example0, the 8s have count7 (the largest) and are at the bottom. Then 5s (count6) in row8, 6s (count5) in row7, 4s (count4) in row6, 1s (count3) in row5, 2s (count2) in row4, 3 (count1) in row3. So the rows are sorted in ascending order of count, but placed from bottom up. Wait, no, because the 3 has count1 (smallest), and it's placed in row3 (higher up), then count2 in row4, etc. So actually, the rows are sorted in ascending order of their non-zero count (1,2,3,4,5,6,7) and placed starting from the bottom. Wait, that's conflicting. Let me think again.\n\nWait, the counts for the non-zero rows in example0 are:\n\n3's row: count1\n\n2's row: count2\n\n1's row: count3\n\n4's row: count4\n\n6's row: count5\n\n5's row: count6\n\n8's row: count7\n\nThese are sorted in ascending order (1,2,3,4,5,6,7). Then the sorted order is 3,2,1,4,6,5,8. But in the output, the rows are arranged from bottom up as 8 (count7), 5 (count6),6 (count5),4 (count4),1 (count3),2 (count2),3 (count1). Wait, that's descending order of counts. Because the largest count is at the bottom.\n\nAh! So the non-zero rows are sorted in descending order of their non-zero count. The row with the highest count is placed at the bottom of the output, then the next highest above it, and so on. The rows with zero count are left as all zeros at the top.\n\nLet's verify with example0:\n\nCounts:\n\nRow0 (2s): 2 elements \u2192 count2\n\nRow1 (3):1 \u2192 count1\n\nRow2 (1s):3 \u2192 count3\n\nRow4 (5s):6 \u2192 count6\n\nRow6 (6s):5 \u2192 count5\n\nRow7 (4s):4 \u2192 count4\n\nRow9 (8s):7 \u2192 count7\n\nSorted in descending order of counts:\n\ncount7 (8s), count6 (5s), count5 (6s), count4 (4s), count3 (1s), count2 (2s), count1 (3)\n\nThen these are placed from the bottom upwards. So the 8s (count7) are at the bottom (row9), then 5s (row8), 6s (row7), 4s (row6), 1s (row5), 2s (row4), 3 (row3). That matches the output of example0.\n\nSimilarly, example1's input:\n\nOriginal rows:\n\nRow0: [0,0,0,1] \u2192 count1\n\nRow2: [2,2,2,0] \u2192 count3\n\nRow4: [0,3,3,0] \u2192 count2\n\nRow6: [8,8,8,8] \u2192 count4\n\nOther rows are zeros.\n\nSo counts are 1,3,2,4. Sorted descending:4,3,2,1.\n\nIn the output, the non-zero rows are:\n\nRow6 (count4) \u2192 stays at bottom (8s)\n\nThen row5 (count3: 2,2,2 \u2192 original row2)\n\nRow4 (count2:3,3 \u2192 original row4)\n\nRow3 (count1:1 \u2192 original row0)\n\nSo output rows:\n\nRow3:1 (count1)\n\nRow4:3,3 (count2)\n\nRow5:2,2,2 (count3)\n\nRow6:8s (count4)\n\nWhich matches example1's output.\n\nAnd example2:\n\nInput rows:\n\n[2,2,0] \u2192 count2\n\n[0,4,0] \u2192 count1\n\n[8,8,8] \u2192 count3\n\nCounts sorted descending:3,2,1. So 8s (count3) stay at bottom. Then 2s (count2) in row1, and 4 (count1) in row0.\n\nBut in example2's output:\n\n[0,0,4]\n\n[0,2,2]\n\n[8,8,8]\n\nSo row0:4 (count1), row1:2s (count2), row2:8s (count3). But according to the pattern, 8s should be at the bottom (row2), then 2s (row1), then 4 (row0). Which matches the example.\n\nThus, the pattern is:\n\nFor each row in the input, count the number of non-zero elements. Then, in the output, the rows with non-zero elements are sorted in descending order of their count and placed starting from the bottom of the output. Rows with the same count are ordered according to their original positions (but need to check if this holds).\n\nIn example0, the 5s (count6) and 6s (count5) are from input rows4 and6. They are placed in output rows8 and7, which follows descending count. Similarly, the 4s (count4) and 1s (count3) are placed correctly.\n\nNow, for the test input, let's apply this pattern.\n\nTest Input:\n\n[6,6,6,0,0,0,0,0] \u2192 count3 (three 6s)\n\n[0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1] \u2192 count4 (four 1s)\n\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0] \u2192 zero count\n\n[0,4,4,4,4,4,0,0] \u2192 count5 (five 4s)\n\n[0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0] \u2192 count2 (two 7s)\n\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0] \u2192 zero\n\n[2,2,2,2,2,2,2,0] \u2192 count7 (seven 2s)\n\n[0,0,3,3,3,3,3,3] \u2192 count6 (six 3s)\n\n[0,9,0,0,0,0,0,0] \u2192 count1 (one 9)\n\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0] \u2192 zero\n\n[8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8] \u2192 count8 (eight 8s)\n\nSo the non-zero rows (count>0) are:\n\nRow0: count3\n\nRow1: count4\n\nRow3: count5\n\nRow4: count2\n\nRow6: count7\n\nRow7: count6\n\nRow8: count1\n\nRow10: count8\n\nNow, sorted in descending order of count:\n\ncount8 (8s, row10) \u2192 count8\n\ncount7 (2s, row6) \u21927\n\ncount6 (3s, row7) \u21926\n\ncount5 (4s, row3) \u21925\n\ncount4 (1s, row1) \u21924\n\ncount3 (6s, row0) \u21923\n\ncount2 (7s, row4) \u21922\n\ncount1 (9, row8) \u21921\n\nThese are the rows to be placed in the output from bottom up. The 8s (count8) stay at the bottom. Then:\n\nNext is 2s (count7) \u2192 row6\n\nThen 3s (count6) \u2192 row7\n\nThen 4s (count5) \u2192 row3\n\nThen 1s (count4) \u2192 row1\n\nThen 6s (count3) \u2192 row0\n\nThen 7s (count2) \u2192 row4\n\nThen 9 (count1) \u2192 row8\n\nSo the order in the output (from bottom up) would be:\n\nRow10:8s (count8)\n\nRow9: 2s (count7) \u2192 original row6\n\nRow8:3s (count6) \u2192 original row7\n\nRow7:4s (count5) \u2192 original row3\n\nRow6:1s (count4) \u2192 original row1\n\nRow5:6s (count3) \u2192 original row0\n\nRow4:7s (count2) \u2192 original row4\n\nRow3:9 (count1) \u2192 original row8\n\nThe remaining rows (zero counts) are filled with zeros.\n\nBut wait, the test input has 11 rows (indices 0 to 10). The output must have the same number of rows. So, the rows with non-zero counts are sorted in descending order and placed starting from the bottom. The zeros are filled in the remaining rows above.\n\nWait, let's list the rows:\n\nTotal rows:11.\n\nOriginal rows with non-zero counts:\n\nrow0: count3 (6s)\n\nrow1: count4 (1s)\n\nrow3: count5 (4s)\n\nrow4: count2 (7s)\n\nrow6: count7 (2s)\n\nrow7: count6 (3s)\n\nrow8: count1 (9)\n\nrow10: count8 (8s)\n\nSorted by descending counts:\n\nrow10 (8s,8)\n\nrow6 (2s,7)\n\nrow7 (3s,6)\n\nrow3 (4s,5)\n\nrow1 (1s,4)\n\nrow0 (6s,3)\n\nrow4 (7s,2)\n\nrow8 (9,1)\n\nSo the sorted list is ordered as per counts from highest to lowest.\n\nIn the output, the bottom row (row10) is 8s. Then above that, row9 will have 2s (from original row6). Then row8 has 3s (from row7). Then row7 has4s (row3). Then row6 has1s (row1). Row5 has6s (row0). Row4 has7s (row4). Row3 has9 (row8). The remaining rows (row0, row2, row5, row9?) Wait, maybe I need to see how many non-zero rows there are.\n\nOriginal non-zero rows: 8 rows (row0,1,3,4,6,7,8,10). Wait, the test input has 11 rows. The non-zero rows are 8 (including row10). So the sorted list has 8 non-zero rows. The output will have these 8 rows placed starting from the bottom (row10) up to row3 (since 8 rows: 10,9,8,7,6,5,4,3). The remaining rows (0,1,2, etc.) will be filled with zeros?\n\nWait, the output needs to have 11 rows, same as input. The non-zero rows are sorted in descending order of their count and placed from the bottom up. Let's list their positions:\n\n- row10: 8s (count8)\n\n- row9: 2s (count7)\n\n- row8:3s (count6)\n\n- row7:4s (count5)\n\n- row6:1s (count4)\n\n- row5:6s (count3)\n\n- row4:7s (count2)\n\n- row3:9 (count1)\n\nThe remaining rows (rows0,1,2, row10 is already filled) will be zeros. Wait, no. Because row3 is non-zero (9), then rows0-2 and row10 are filled as per the sorted list.\n\nWait, the output rows are:\n\nrow0: zeros?\n\nrow1: zeros?\n\nrow2: zeros?\n\nrow3: [0,9,0,0,0,0,0,0] transformed?\n\nWait, no. The non-zero rows are placed from the bottom up. Let me think again.\n\nThe sorted list of non-zero rows (descending counts):\n\n1. row10: count8 \u2192 8s \u2192 bottom row (row10 in output).\n\n2. row6: count7 \u2192 2s \u2192 row9.\n\n3. row7: count6 \u21923s \u2192 row8.\n\n4. row3: count5 \u21924s \u2192 row7.\n\n5. row1: count4 \u21921s \u2192 row6.\n\n6. row0: count3 \u21926s \u2192 row5.\n\n7. row4: count2 \u21927s \u2192 row4.\n\n8. row8: count1 \u21929 \u2192 row3.\n\nSo the output rows are:\n\nrow10:8s.\n\nrow9:2s (from original row6).\n\nrow8:3s (original row7).\n\nrow7:4s (original row3).\n\nrow6:1s (original row1).\n\nrow5:6s (original row0).\n\nrow4:7s (original row4).\n\nrow3:9 (original row8).\n\nRows 0,1,2,2? Wait, original rows 2,5,9, etc. are zeros and are filled with zeros in the output.\n\nNow, for each of these rows, how are the elements arranged in the output rows?\n\nLooking at the training examples, the non-zero elements are right-aligned in their respective rows. For example:\n\nIn example0, input row0 (2s) was [0,2,2,0,0,0,0] \u2192 count2. Output row4: [0,0,0,0,0,2,2]. So the 2s are shifted to the right.\n\nSimilarly, row1 input (3) was [0,0,0,0,3,0,0] \u2192 output row3: [0,0,0,0,0,0,3], right-aligned.\n\nSo the transformation seems to be, for each non-zero row, the non-zero elements are moved to the right (right-aligned) within their row, and the rest are zeros.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. For each non-zero row in the input, count the number of non-zero elements (count).\n\n2. Sort all non-zero rows in descending order of count. If counts are same, perhaps the original order is preserved? (Need to check.)\n\n3. Place these sorted rows starting from the bottom of the output, with each row's non-zero elements right-aligned.\n\n4. Fill the remaining rows (those with zero count) with all zeros.\n\nApplying this to the test input:\n\nThe non-zero rows after sorting:\n\nRow10:8s (count8) \u2192 right-aligned, so the entire row is 8s \u2192 [8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8] (no change since they fill the row).\n\nRow9:2s (original row6: [2,2,2,2,2,2,2,0] \u2192 count7). Right-aligned: [0,2,2,2,2,2,2,2].\n\nRow8:3s (original row7: [0,0,3,3,3,3,3,3] \u2192 count6). Right-aligned: [0,0,3,3,3,3,3,3].\n\nRow7:4s (original row3: [0,4,4,4,4,4,0,0] \u2192 count5). Right-aligned: [0,0,0,4,4,4,4,4].\n\nRow6:1s (original row1: [0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1] \u2192 count4). Right-aligned: [0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1].\n\nRow5:6s (original row0: [6,6,6,0,0,0,0,0] \u2192 count3). Right-aligned: [0,0,0,0,0,6,6,6].\n\nRow4:7s (original row4: [0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0] \u2192 count2). Right-aligned: [0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7].\n\nRow3:9 (original row8: [0,9,0,0,0,0,0,0] \u2192 count1). Right-aligned: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,9].\n\nThe remaining rows (0,1,2, and the rows not in the sorted list) are filled with zeros.\n\nNow, let's construct the output:\n\nTotal rows:11.\n\nOutput rows from bottom up:\n\nRow10: [8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8]\n\nRow9: [0,2,2,2,2,2,2,2]\n\nRow8: [0,0,3,3,3,3,3,3]\n\nRow7: [0,0,0,4,4,4,4,4]\n\nRow6: [0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1]\n\nRow5: [0,0,0,0,0,6,6,6]\n\nRow4: [0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7]\n\nRow3: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,9]\n\nRows 2,1,0: all zeros.\n\nSo the final output should be:\n\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9]\n\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7]\n\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6]\n\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1]\n\n[0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4]\n\n[0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3]\n\n[0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2]\n\n[8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8]\n\nLet me check if this matches the training examples' format. In example0, the rows with non-zero entries are right-aligned. Yes. So the pattern holds.\n\nThus, this should be the correct output."
