        "cot_1": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. So, the problem is to look at the input matrices and determine the output based on the training examples. Let's start by analyzing the training examples one by one.\n\nLooking at Example 0:\n\nInput:\n[\n [2, 1, 2, 1, 2],\n [1, 1, 1, 1, 1],\n [2, 1, 2, 1, 2],\n [0, 0, 1, 1, 1],\n [0, 0, 2, 1, 2]\n]\n\nOutput:\n[1, 1]\n[2, 1]\n\nHmm, what's happening here? The output has two arrays. Let me look at the input to see how these outputs are derived. Maybe the output is related to some symmetry or specific positions. Let's check the rows. The first row is [2,1,2,1,2], which alternates between 2 and 1. The second row is all 1s. The third is same as first. Then the fourth and fifth rows start with 0s. The output arrays are [1,1] and [2,1]. Wait, maybe it's about the non-zero elements in certain positions. Or perhaps looking at the last few elements of each row.\n\nAnother approach: Maybe each output row corresponds to certain rows in the input. For example, in Example 0, the output has two rows. The input has 5 rows. Let's see. The output rows could be the central elements of the input rows. Wait, the input rows for Example 0 have varying lengths (all 5 elements). Let's see the first output [1,1]. Maybe it's the middle element of the first three rows. The first three rows of the input are the first three rows. The middle element of each of those rows? Let's see: first row's middle element is index 2 (0-based) which is 2. Second row's middle is 1. Third row's middle is 2. So that would be 2,1,2. Not matching the output. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is constructed by taking the minimum or maximum of certain rows. Wait, the output in Example 0 is two rows. Maybe each output row is the result of processing a pair of input rows. Let's look at the input rows:\n\nRow0: 2,1,2,1,2\n\nRow1: 1,1,1,1,1\n\nRow2: 2,1,2,1,2\n\nRow3: 0,0,1,1,1\n\nRow4:0,0,2,1,2\n\nThe output is two rows: [1,1] and [2,1]. Maybe each output row is a pair of elements from the input. Let's check where 1 and 1 could come from. Looking at row1, all are 1s. But the first output row is [1,1]. Maybe it's the first two elements of row1? But row1 starts with 1,1. But the output is [1,1]. Alternatively, maybe it's looking for rows that have a certain pattern. For example, row1 is all 1s. Then row3 and row4 start with 0s. Maybe the outputs are the elements after the leading zeros. Like in row3: after two zeros, we have 1,1,1. But the output has [1,1], perhaps taking the first two elements of that part. Then row4's after two zeros is 2,1,2. So the first two would be 2,1. Which matches the second output row [2,1]. Oh, that makes sense! So maybe the pattern is: for each input row, if the row starts with one or more zeros, the output takes the next two elements after the leading zeros. Then the output rows are formed by collecting those pairs where the original row had leading zeros. Let's check this.\n\nIn Example 0:\n\nRow3: [0,0,1,1,1] \u2192 leading two zeros, then take 1,1 \u2192 [1,1]\n\nRow4: [0,0,2,1,2] \u2192 leading two zeros, take 2,1 \u2192 [2,1]\n\nWhich matches the output. That's a possible pattern.\n\nTesting this with Example 1:\n\nInput:\n\n[\n [8,6,0,6],\n [6,8,6,8],\n [8,6,8,6],\n [6,8,6,8]\n]\n\nOutput: [8]\n\nSo according to the pattern, we look for rows that start with zeros. But none of the rows here start with zeros. Wait, then maybe this pattern doesn't hold. Let me check again.\n\nWait, Example 1's output is [8], but the input rows are:\n\nRow0: 8,6,0,6\n\nRow1: 6,8,6,8\n\nRow2:8,6,8,6\n\nRow3:6,8,6,8\n\nSo perhaps the pattern is different here. Let's see the output [8]. How can that be derived? The first row has 8 as the first element, but the output is a single 8. Maybe it's about columns. Let me check the columns.\n\nLooking at columns, each column is like:\n\nColumn0: 8,6,8,6 \u2192 alternating\n\nColumn1:6,8,6,8 \u2192 alternating\n\nColumn2:0,6,8,6\n\nColumn3:6,8,6,8\n\nHmm, perhaps looking for columns that have all the same elements. But none of the columns are all the same. Wait, maybe the output is the element that's in the center. But the output is a single element. Let's think differently.\n\nWait, the input is a 4x4 matrix. The output is [8]. Maybe it's the maximum value in the matrix? The maximum is 8, but that's just a guess. But in Example 0, the output rows are [1,1] and [2,1], which aren't the max. So that's probably not.\n\nAlternative approach: Let's check Example 2.\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput:\n[\n [2,2,5,2,2,5,2],\n [2,2,5,2,2,5,2],\n [5,5,5,5,5,5,5],\n [2,2,5,2,2,5,2],\n [2,2,5,2,2,5,2],\n [5,5,5,5,5,0,0],\n [2,2,5,2,2,0,0]\n]\n\nOutput:\n[5,5]\n[5,2]\n\nApplying the previous pattern of leading zeros: Looking at the input rows, the last two rows (row5 and row6) have trailing zeros. Wait, row5 is [5,5,5,5,5,0,0]. The trailing elements are 0s. So if the pattern was leading zeros, but these are trailing. So perhaps the pattern is: for each row, if there are trailing zeros, take the elements before them. But how?\n\nRow5 ends with two zeros. So the elements before them would be 5,0? But output is [5,5] and [5,2]. Hmm, not matching. Alternatively, maybe in the rows that end with zeros, take the elements just before the zeros. Let's see.\n\nRow5: ...5,0,0. So the elements before the zeros are 5 (at index 4) and 5 (index5 is 0). Wait, index 4 is 5, index5 is 0. No, that's not helpful. Maybe the last non-zero elements. For row5, the elements before the trailing zeros are 5 (index4), but then after that, the next is 0. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is constructed from rows that have a certain number of zeros. Let's check row5 and row6. Row5 has two zeros at the end, row6 has three zeros? Wait, row6 is [2,2,5,2,2,0,0] \u2192 two zeros. So the output has two rows: [5,5] and [5,2]. How to get these from rows 5 and 6?\n\nLooking at row5: [5,5,5,5,5,0,0]. If we take the first two elements after the leading 5s? No. Alternatively, perhaps the last two non-zero elements. For row5, the non-zero elements are the first five: 5,5,5,5,5. The last two are 5,5 \u2192 which is [5,5]. For row6: [2,2,5,2,2,0,0]. The non-zero elements are first five: 2,2,5,2,2. The last two non-zero elements are 2,2. But the output is [5,2]. Wait, that doesn't match. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the elements before the zeros. Row5 has two zeros at the end. The elements before are 5 (index4) and 5 (index5) but index5 is 0. No. So maybe this approach is not correct.\n\nAlternatively, looking back at Example 0, the output rows are [1,1] and [2,1], which are the first two elements after the leading zeros in rows 3 and 4. So maybe the pattern is: for each row in the input, if there are leading zeros, take the next two elements after the leading zeros. Then collect all such pairs as output rows. So in Example 0, rows 3 and 4 have leading zeros (two zeros each), so their next two elements are [1,1] and [2,1], hence the output.\n\nIn Example 1, the input rows don't have leading zeros, except maybe row0: [8,6,0,6]. No leading zeros. So according to this pattern, the output would be nothing, but the actual output is [8]. So that contradicts. So maybe the pattern is different.\n\nWait, maybe it's trailing zeros instead. Let's check Example 1 again. The input rows:\n\nRow0: 8,6,0,6\n\nRow1: 6,8,6,8\n\nRow2:8,6,8,6\n\nRow3:6,8,6,8\n\nNone of the rows have trailing zeros. So how does the output [8] come about? Hmm.\n\nAlternative idea: Maybe the output is the elements that are at the positions where the majority of the rows have the same element. For example, in Example 1, the output is [8]. Looking at the input matrix:\n\nFirst column: 8,6,8,6 \u2192 alternating, so no majority.\n\nSecond column:6,8,6,8 \u2192 same.\n\nThird column:0,6,8,6 \u2192 0,6,8,6 \u2192 no majority.\n\nFourth column:6,8,6,8 \u2192 alternating.\n\nBut the output is [8]. Hmm. Not sure.\n\nAnother approach: Looking at the output for Example 1, which is [8]. It's a single element. How could that be? Maybe it's the element that appears in all four rows. Let's check:\n\nRow0 has 8,6,0,6.\n\nRow1:6,8,6,8.\n\nRow2:8,6,8,6.\n\nRow3:6,8,6,8.\n\nThe number 8 appears in all rows, but also 6 appears in all. So why output [8]? Unless it's the maximum between them, but in that case, 8 is larger. But why would that be the case? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the element that is in the diagonal. Let's see. The matrix is 4x4. The main diagonal would be 8 (row0, col0), 8 (row1, col1), 8 (row2, col2), 8 (row3, col3). Wait, row3 col3 is 8. So the diagonal is [8,8,8,8], so all 8s. So the output could be [8], but in Example 0, the diagonal of the input matrix is 2,1,2,0,2. Which has elements 2,1,2,0,2. The output is [1,1] and [2,1], which doesn't relate to the diagonal. So maybe that's not the pattern.\n\nAlternative idea: Maybe the output is the elements that are surrounded by the same number. For example, in a cross pattern. Not sure.\n\nAnother angle: Looking at the output of Example 0 and Example 2, they have multiple rows, each with two elements. Example 1's output is a single row with one element. So perhaps the output depends on some condition where in some cases the rows have leading or trailing elements that are taken, and in others, different conditions. This complicates things.\n\nLet me try to see Example 2's output again. The output is two rows: [5,5] and [5,2]. How do these relate to the input?\n\nInput rows:\n\nRow5: [5,5,5,5,5,0,0]\n\nRow6: [2,2,5,2,2,0,0]\n\nIf we take the first two elements after leading elements. But row5 starts with 5,5. So maybe taking the elements after the first three? Or perhaps the elements before the trailing zeros. For row5, before the two zeros, the elements are 5 (index4) and 5 (index5). But index5 is 0. No. Wait, row5 has length 7. The zeros are at positions 5 and 6. So elements before are positions 0-4. The elements at positions 4 and 5 are 5 and 0. Hmm, not helpful. Alternatively, the last two non-zero elements. For row5, positions 0-4 are all 5s, so the last two non-zero are 5 and 5. So [5,5]. For row6, the last two non-zero elements are 2 and 2 (positions 4 and 5?), but row6 is [2,2,5,2,2,0,0]. The non-zero elements are positions 0-4: 2,2,5,2,2. So last two are 2 and 2. But the output for row6 is [5,2]. Wait, that doesn't match. So maybe that's not the pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the elements that are just before the zeros. For row5, the elements before the zeros are the 5 at position 4 and 5 at position5 (which is 0). Wait, that's not right. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by looking at the first occurrence where a row has a certain number of consecutive zeros. For example, in Example 0, rows 3 and 4 have two leading zeros. So their outputs are the next two elements. For Example 2, rows 5 and 6 have two trailing zeros. So perhaps the output takes the two elements before the trailing zeros. Let's check:\n\nRow5: elements before trailing zeros are positions 4 and 5 (5 and 0) \u2192 but 0 is part of the trailing zeros. So maybe positions 3 and 4. Then 5 and 5. That gives [5,5]. For row6: positions 4 and 5 \u2192 2 and 0. So maybe position 3 and 4: 2 and 2. But output is [5,2]. So that doesn't fit. Hmm.\n\nWait, but the output for Example 2 is [5,5] and [5,2]. Let's look at row5 and row6. Row5 has [5,5,5,5,5,0,0]. The elements before the zeros (positions 5 and 6) are at positions 4 and 5 (5 and 0). Wait, but 0 is part of the trailing zeros. So maybe the elements before that are positions 3 and 4: 5 and5. Which gives [5,5], matching the first output. For row6: [2,2,5,2,2,0,0]. Before the zeros, positions 4 and5: 2 and0. But the output is [5,2]. So that's not matching. Alternatively, perhaps the last two non-zero elements. For row5, the last non-zero is at position4 (5), and the one before that is position3 (5). So [5,5]. For row6: last non-zero is position4 (2), and the one before is position3 (2). So [2,2], but output is [5,2]. Doesn't match.\n\nWait, but the output for row6 is [5,2]. Where could that come from? Let's look at row6: [2,2,5,2,2,0,0]. The fifth element is 0. So maybe the third and fourth elements? 5 and 2. That would be positions 2 and3 (0-based). 5 and 2. Yes, that's [5,2]. So perhaps the pattern is: for each row that ends with two zeros, take the third and fourth elements from the end. For example, in row5, which has two trailing zeros, the elements before that are the fifth and sixth elements (assuming the trailing zeros are the last two). Wait, the indices are 0-6. So for row5, elements are [5,5,5,5,5,0,0]. The trailing zeros are positions5 and6. The elements before them are positions4 (5) and5 (0). But that's not helpful. Alternatively, for rows ending with two zeros, take the elements that are two positions before the start of the zeros. For example, in row5, the zeros start at position5. So two positions before are positions3 and4: 5 and5. Which gives [5,5]. For row6: zeros start at position5. Two positions before: positions3 and4: 2 and2. But the output is [5,2]. So that's not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rows that have trailing zeros and the zeros are in the last two positions. For those rows, take the fifth and sixth elements (but row5 is length 7). Wait, row5 has elements 0-6. The zeros are at positions5 and6. The fifth element is 0. So that's not helpful. Hmm.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Let's go back to the examples and see if there's a common theme.\n\nExample 0: Rows with leading zeros \u2192 output the next two elements.\n\nExample 2: Rows with trailing zeros \u2192 output the previous two elements before the zeros.\n\nBut Example 1 has no leading or trailing zeros. So how does it produce [8]?\n\nWait, in Example1's input, row0 is [8,6,0,6]. The third element is 0. Maybe the pattern is to look for elements that are zero and take the elements around them. But the output is [8].\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the elements that are unique in their row. Let's see:\n\nIn Example0, rows3 and4 have leading zeros. The elements after are 1,1,1 and 2,1,2. So the first two elements after zeros are [1,1] and [2,1], which are the outputs. In Example1, none of the rows have leading or trailing zeros. But row0 has a 0 in the third position. Maybe the output is the elements before and after the zero. For row0, 8,6 before the 0 and 6 after. But the output is [8]. Not sure.\n\nAlternative idea: Let's think of the input as a grid and look for cells that are surrounded by the same number. But Example1's output is [8], and maybe there's a cell that's surrounded by 8s. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is the elements that appear in all rows. For Example0, the output rows are [1,1] and [2,1]. But 1 appears in multiple rows. Not sure.\n\nAnother approach: Looking at the outputs and inputs, perhaps the output is the most frequent element(s) in specific positions. For example, in Example1, the output is [8]. Maybe the first element of each row is 8,6,8,6. The majority is 8 and6, but not sure. The output is 8. Maybe the mode of the first elements. But in this case, 8 and6 each appear twice, so no mode.\n\nAlternatively, the output in Example1 is [8], which is the first element of the first row. But that seems arbitrary.\n\nWait, maybe the output is the element that is in the position where all rows have that element. For example, in Example1, all rows have 8 in some column. Let's check the columns:\n\nColumn0: 8,6,8,6 \u2192 contains 8 and6.\n\nColumn1:6,8,6,8 \u2192 same.\n\nColumn2:0,6,8,6 \u2192 0,6,8,6.\n\nColumn3:6,8,6,8 \u21926,8.\n\nSo none of the columns have all 8s. So that's not it.\n\nAnother thought: Maybe the output is the element that is present in the majority of the rows, but in the same position. For example, in Example1, the third column has 0,6,8,6. So 6 appears three times, but the output is 8. So that doesn't fit.\n\nThis is really tricky. Let's recap the examples:\n\nTraining Examples:\n\nExample0: Outputs correspond to rows with leading zeros, taking next two elements.\n\nExample1: Output is [8], but no leading zeros.\n\nExample2: Outputs correspond to rows with trailing zeros, taking two elements before the zeros.\n\nBut this is inconsistent. So maybe the pattern is more about the position of zeros in the rows and capturing certain elements around them.\n\nAlternatively, think of the input as a grid and the output as some kind of path or connected regions. For instance, in Example0, the outputs [1,1] and [2,1] could be from certain positions in the grid where there are changes.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is formed by looking for rows where a certain number (like 0) appears, and then extracting other numbers from those rows. For example, in Example0, rows3 and4 have 0s, so output is elements after the zeros. In Example2, rows5 and6 have 0s, so output is elements before the zeros. Example1's row0 has a 0 in the third position, so maybe take elements around that 0. Let's check:\n\nRow0 in Example1 is [8,6,0,6]. The 0 is at index2. So maybe take the elements before and after: 6 (index1) and6 (index3). But that would be [6,6], not the output [8].\n\nHmm.\n\nAnother angle: Let's look at the output lengths. Example0's output has two rows, each of length 2. Example1 has one row of length1. Example2 has two rows of length2.\n\nSo perhaps the output is constructed by considering rows that contain zeros and then extracting two elements from each such row. The way the elements are extracted depends on where the zeros are. For leading zeros: take next two elements. For trailing zeros: take previous two. For zeros in the middle: perhaps take the two elements around the zero.\n\nBut how does Example1's output fit into this?\n\nExample1's input row0 has a zero at index2. So the elements before and after are 6 (index1) and6 (index3). But the output is [8]. Doesn't match.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the zero is in the middle and the two elements before and after the zero. Row0's zero is at index2. Elements before: 8,6 (indices0 and1), after: 6 (index3). But that gives 8,6 and 6. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the sum of elements around the zero. For Example1's row0: 8 +6 +6 = 20. Not related to output [8].\n\nThis is really challenging. Let's try to find another pattern.\n\nAnother idea: The outputs in all examples are lists of numbers that appear in the input. For example, in Example0, the outputs are 1 and2. Example1's output is 8. Example2's outputs are 5 and2. So maybe the outputs are the numbers that are in the majority or form a certain pattern.\n\nAlternatively, the output could be the elements that are at the same positions where all rows have a certain property. For example, columns where all elements are the same. In Example0, there's no column with all elements the same. In Example1, no column has all elements the same. In Example2, the third column (index2) is all5 except the last two rows. So that doesn't fit.\n\nWait, in Example2's input, rows0,1,3,4 have 5 at index2. Rows2 has all5s, row5 has 5 at index2, row6 has 5 at index2. So column2 is mostly 5 except row5 and row6? No, row5's index2 is5. row6's index2 is5. So all rows have5 at index2. So column2 is all5s. But the output for Example2 is [5,5] and [5,2]. So maybe that's not related.\n\nAlternative approach: Let's think of the output as the minimum or maximum in certain rows. For Example0, the output rows are [1,1] and [2,1]. The maximum of each is 1 and 2 respectively. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is formed by taking pairs of elements from the input rows that form a certain pattern. For instance, in Example0, the outputs are pairs of the same number (1,1) and (2,1). Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the output could be the elements that form the \"borders\" of the matrix. For example, the outer elements. In Example0, the outer elements are 2,1,2,0,0, etc. Not sure.\n\nAnother idea: Let's look at the sum of the output elements. In Example0: [1+1, 2+1] = [2,3]. Not sure. Example1's sum is 8. Example2: [5+5, 5+2] \u2192 [10,7]. Not obvious.\n\nPerhaps the pattern is that the output consists of the two elements following the first occurrence of a zero in each row. For Example0's rows3 and4:\n\nRow3: [0,0,1,1,1] \u2192 first zero is at index0. Next two elements are 0 and1. But the output is [1,1]. Hmm, not matching.\n\nAlternatively, for rows with multiple zeros, take the elements after the last zero. Not sure.\n\nAnother possibility: The output is formed by the elements that are mirrored around the center. For Example0, the output rows are [1,1] and [2,1]. Maybe those are the centers of certain rows. The center of row1 (all 1s) is 1. But output has two elements. So probably not.\n\nWait, let's try to see if the output corresponds to the smallest subarray that is repeated in the row. For Example0, row3 has [0,0,1,1,1], the subarray [1,1] appears. But row3's output is [1,1]. Maybe that's the case. But for row4: [0,0,2,1,2], the output is [2,1], which is the middle elements. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the output rows could be the two middle elements of each row. For Example0's row3: length5. Middle elements are index2 and3: 1 and1 \u2192 [1,1]. Row4's middle elements are index2 (2) and3 (1) \u2192 [2,1]. That matches. Let's check other examples.\n\nExample1's input rows are length4. For even length, middle elements would be index1 and2. Let's look at each row:\n\nRow0: [8,6,0,6] \u2192 middle elements 6 and0 \u2192 sum would not lead to output [8]. But output is [8], which doesn't match.\n\nExample2's rows are length7. Middle elements are indices3 and4. Let's check:\n\nRow5: [5,5,5,5,5,0,0] \u2192 indices3 and4: 5 and5 \u2192 [5,5] which matches the first output row.\n\nRow6: [2,2,5,2,2,0,0] \u2192 indices3 and4:2 and2 \u2192 but output is [5,2]. So that doesn't match. So this theory is invalid.\n\nAnother idea: The output is formed by the elements that are at the same position across multiple rows. For instance, in Example0, two rows have zeros in the first two positions. The output is the elements from those rows after the zeros. \n\nBut in Example2, two rows have trailing zeros. The output is the elements before the zeros. So maybe the pattern is that whenever a row has a run of zeros (either leading or trailing), you take the first two non-zero elements after leading zeros or the last two non-zero elements before trailing zeros.\n\nLet's test this:\n\nExample0: rows3 and4 have leading zeros. Take first two non-zero after \u2192 [1,1] and [2,1].\n\nExample2: rows5 and6 have trailing zeros. Take last two non-zero before \u2192 row5's last two non-zero are 5 and5 \u2192 [5,5]. row6's last two non-zero are 2 and2. But the output for row6 is [5,2]. This doesn't fit. So perhaps it's not.\n\nBut in row6 of Example2, the last two non-zero elements are 2 and2. Output is [5,2]. So why is there a 5 here?\n\nLooking at row6: [2,2,5,2,2,0,0]. The non-zero elements are the first five: 2,2,5,2,2. So the last two are 2 and2. But the output is [5,2]. So this doesn't align.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is to take the two elements before the zeros start. In row6, the zeros start at index5 and6. The elements before are at indices4 (2) and5 (0). But that's 2 and0. Not matching.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the two elements before the first zero in the row. For row5: [5,5,5,5,5,0,0]. The first zero is at index5. The two elements before are 5 and5 \u2192 [5,5]. For row6: first zero is at index5. The two elements before are 2 and2 \u2192 but output is [5,2]. So that doesn't fit. So this theory is invalid.\n\nAt this point, I'm a bit stuck. Let's try to see if there's a different approach. Maybe the output is formed by the elements that are part of a certain shape in the input matrix, like a rectangle or cross.\n\nExample0's input matrix:\n\nRow0: 2,1,2,1,2\n\nRow1: all 1s\n\nRow2: same as row0\n\nRow3:0,0,1,1,1\n\nRow4:0,0,2,1,2\n\nThe output is two rows: [1,1] and [2,1]. This seems like the middle part of row3 and row4 after the zeros. But how does this connect to the other examples?\n\nExample1's output is [8]. The input matrix is a 4x4 grid. Maybe the output is the element in the center. For a 4x4 grid, the center is between the second and third rows and columns. But that's not a single element. So perhaps the output is the maximum element in the matrix, which is 8. But why would that be the case?\n\nAlternatively, in Example1, the rows alternate between starting with 8 and6. The output is [8], which could be the first element of the first row. But that's not a consistent pattern.\n\nAnother angle: Maybe the output is the elements that form the corners of the matrix. For Example0, the corners are 2 (top-left), 2 (top-right), 0 (bottom-left), 2 (bottom-right). Not matching the output.\n\nAlternatively, think of the matrix as layers, like an onion, and the output is elements from certain layers. Not sure.\n\nAnother idea: Look for the smallest number in each row and output their pairs. For Example0, rows3 and4 have 0s, but the outputs are [1,1] and [2,1], which don't include 0. So that's not.\n\nAlternatively, the output could be the elements that appear in the same position in multiple rows. For Example0's output rows [1,1] and [2,1], these are the third and fourth elements of rows3 and4. But how does this apply to other examples?\n\nLet's consider that the output is formed by the two elements that are common in the same position across multiple rows. For Example1's output [8], perhaps the number 8 appears in the same position in all rows. Let's check:\n\nRow0: 8,6,0,6 \u2192 8 in position0\n\nRow1:6,8,6,8 \u21928 in position1 and3\n\nRow2:8,6,8,6 \u21928 in position0 and2\n\nRow3:6,8,6,8 \u21928 in position1 and3\n\nSo 8 appears in different positions, not the same across all rows. So the output [8] could be the number that appears in the most positions, but that's not clear.\n\nAt this point, I think I need to try to apply the possible pattern to the test input and see if it makes sense.\n\nTest Input:\n\n[\n [8,1,8,8,0,0,0],\n [1,8,8,1,0,0,0],\n [8,8,1,8,0,0,0],\n [8,1,8,8,1,8,8],\n [1,8,8,1,8,8,1],\n [8,8,1,8,8,1,8],\n [8,1,8,8,1,8,8]\n]\n\nAccording to the pattern where rows with leading zeros contribute the next two elements, and rows with trailing zeros contribute the two elements before, let's look for such rows.\n\nLooking at each row:\n\nRow0: [8,1,8,8,0,0,0] \u2192 trailing zeros at positions4,5,6. So three trailing zeros. Maybe take two elements before the zeros. Positions3 and4: 8 and0. Hmm. But 0 is part of the zeros. So maybe positions3 and4 are 8 and0. But that's not helpful. Or perhaps the last two non-zero elements. The non-zero part is 8,1,8,8. The last two are 8 and8. So [8,8].\n\nRow1: [1,8,8,1,0,0,0] \u2192 trailing zeros. Last two non-zero are 1 and0 (wait, position4 is0). So the non-zero part is 1,8,8,1. Last two are 8 and1 \u2192 [8,1].\n\nRow2: [8,8,1,8,0,0,0] \u2192 trailing zeros. Non-zero part is8,8,1,8. Last two are1 and8 \u2192 [1,8].\n\nRow3: [8,1,8,8,1,8,8] \u2192 no zeros. So ignore.\n\nRow4: [1,8,8,1,8,8,1] \u2192 no zeros. Ignore.\n\nRow5: [8,8,1,8,8,1,8] \u2192 no zeros. Ignore.\n\nRow6: [8,1,8,8,1,8,8] \u2192 no zeros. Ignore.\n\nSo the rows with trailing zeros are rows0,1,2. Each has three trailing zeros, but according to previous examples, maybe take two elements before the zeros. So:\n\nRow0: elements before the trailing zeros are positions3 and4 \u2192 8 and0. But 0 is part of the zeros. So maybe take the last two non-zero elements, which are 8 and8 \u2192 [8,8].\n\nRow1: last two non-zero are8 and1 \u2192 [8,1].\n\nRow2: last two non-zero are1 and8 \u2192 [1,8].\n\nBut the output from the training examples sometimes has two elements per row. However, the test input has three rows with trailing zeros. So the output would have three rows: [8,8], [8,1], [1,8]. But looking at the training examples, Example0 had two rows with leading zeros, output two rows. Example2 had two rows with trailing zeros, output two rows. So this pattern would suggest that the test input's output has three rows. But let's check the training examples for consistency.\n\nIn Example2, rows5 and6 have trailing zeros. The output is two rows. So maybe the number of trailing zeros must be exactly two. Let's check:\n\nTest input's rows0,1,2 have three trailing zeros. So maybe they are ignored. But Example2's row5 has two trailing zeros and row6 has two. So the pattern could be rows with exactly two trailing zeros contribute their last two non-zero elements. So in test input, do any rows have exactly two trailing zeros? No, all have three. So perhaps no outputs from trailing zeros.\n\nAlternatively, rows with any number of trailing zeros contribute the last two non-zero elements. So rows0,1,2 would contribute [8,8], [8,1], [1,8]. But the training examples may not support this.\n\nAlternatively, maybe rows with any trailing zeros (more than one) contribute their last two non-zero elements. So in test input, rows0,1,2 would each contribute.\n\nBut the training examples: in Example0, rows with leading zeros (two) contribute. In Example2, rows with trailing zeros (two) contribute.\n\nIf the test input has rows with trailing zeros (three), perhaps they are considered as contributing as well. So the output would be three rows: [8,8], [8,1], [1,8]. But looking back at the training examples, Example0's output has two rows for two leading zeros, Example1's output is one row (but no obvious zeros), and Example2's output has two rows for two trailing zeros.\n\nBut how does Example1 fit in? Let's re-examine Example1:\n\nInput rows:\n\nRow0:8,6,0,6 \u2192 contains a zero in the middle.\n\nRow1:6,8,6,8 \u2192 no zeros.\n\nRow2:8,6,8,6 \u2192 no zeros.\n\nRow3:6,8,6,8 \u2192 no zeros.\n\nThe output is [8]. According to the previous pattern, there are no leading or trailing zeros. So how is [8] formed?\n\nAh! Maybe the zero in row0 is not leading or trailing. But maybe when a row contains a zero (anywhere), we look for the elements before and after the zero. For Example1's row0: [8,6,0,6]. The zero is at index2. The elements before and after are 6 (index1) and6 (index3). So maybe output [6,6]. But the actual output is [8]. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAnother thought: Maybe the output is the maximum element in the row where a zero is present. For row0 in Example1: max is8. So output [8]. For rows with zeros, output the maximum element of that row. Let's check:\n\nExample0's rows3 and4 have zeros. row3's max is1. Output is [1,1]. No, because row3's output is [1,1], which is two elements, not the max.\n\nExample2's rows5 and6 have zeros. row5's max is5, row6's max is5. So outputs would be [5], [5]. But Example2's output is two rows of two elements each. So this doesn't fit.\n\nSo this theory is invalid.\n\nMaybe the output is the first occurrence of a non-zero element after a zero. For Example1's row0: after the zero (index2) is6. But output is8. So no.\n\nAnother approach: Maybe the output is the elements that are in the same position as the zeros in their rows. For Example0, rows3 and4 have zeros in positions0 and1. The output elements are from positions2 and3. So positions after the zeros. For Example2, rows5 and6 have zeros in positions5 and6. The output elements are from positions4 and5 (but those are zeros), so maybe positions3 and4. For row5, positions3 and4 are5 and5 \u2192 [5,5]. For row6, positions3 and4 are2 and2 \u2192 but output is [5,2]. Doesn't fit.\n\nThis is really challenging. Given the time I've spent and the lack of a clear pattern, I'll have to make an educated guess based on the most plausible pattern from the training examples.\n\nThe most consistent pattern across the training examples seems to be:\n\n- For rows with leading zeros, take the first two elements after the zeros.\n\n- For rows with trailing zeros, take the last two elements before the zeros.\n\nApplying this to the test input:\n\nTest input has rows0,1,2 with trailing zeros. Each of these rows has three trailing zeros. The elements before the zeros are:\n\nRow0: [8,1,8,8,0,0,0] \u2192 trailing zeros start at index4. Elements before are up to index3: [8,1,8,8]. The last two elements before zeros are8 and8 \u2192 [8,8].\n\nRow1: [1,8,8,1,0,0,0] \u2192 elements before zeros are [1,8,8,1]. Last two:8,1 \u2192 [8,1].\n\nRow2: [8,8,1,8,0,0,0] \u2192 elements before zeros are [8,8,1,8]. Last two:1,8 \u2192 [1,8].\n\nThen rows3,4,5,6 have no leading or trailing zeros. However, looking at Example1 where there were no leading/trailing zeros but output was [8], perhaps there's another condition. But since I can't figure out Example1's pattern, I'll proceed with the trailing zeros case.\n\nBut according to Example1's output, perhaps if there are no rows with leading/trailing zeros, the output is the maximum value in the entire matrix. Example1's matrix has max 8. So output [8].\n\nBut then, for the test input, after rows0,1,2 contribute [8,8], [8,1], [1,8], perhaps there are other rows contributing.\n\nLooking at rows3,4,5,6 in the test input:\n\nRow3: [8,1,8,8,1,8,8]\n\nRow4: [1,8,8,1,8,8,1]\n\nRow5: [8,8,1,8,8,1,8]\n\nRow6: [8,1,8,8,1,8,8]\n\nNone of these have leading or trailing zeros. So according to Example1's pattern, maybe there's a row with a zero in the middle. But these rows don't have zeros. So perhaps no contribution from these rows.\n\nThus, the output would be:\n\n[8,8]\n\n[8,1]\n\n[1,8]\n\nBut looking at the training examples, the outputs are structured with each output row on a separate line. For example, Example0 has two output rows, Example1 has one, Example2 has two.\n\nHowever, the test input has three rows with trailing zeros, so three output rows. But looking back at the training examples:\n\nExample0: two output rows.\n\nExample1: one output row.\n\nExample2: two output rows.\n\nSo the number of output rows depends on the number of rows in the input that meet the condition (leading or trailing zeros). In the test input, three rows meet the trailing zeros condition. But the training examples have outputs with multiple rows, but the test input's expected output may vary.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's another layer to the pattern. Looking at Example2, the outputs are [5,5] and [5,2]. These correspond to rows5 and6 in the input. For row5, the elements before the trailing zeros are 5,5,5,5,5, then zeros. Taking the last two non-zero elements:5,5. For row6, elements before zeros are2,2,5,2,2. Last two are2,2. But the output for row6 is [5,2]. This suggests that maybe the elements are not the last two non-zero, but something else. For row6 in Example2: [2,2,5,2,2,0,0]. The output is [5,2]. These are the third and fourth elements (indexes2 and3). So 5 and2. So why those positions?\n\nMaybe the pattern is: for trailing zeros, take the elements at the positions that are the length of the row minus the number of trailing zeros minus two and minus one. For example, in row5 of Example2: length7, trailing zeros are 2. So 7-2=5. Take elements at positions5-2-1=2 and 3? No, 7-2=5, so positions3 and4 (5-2=5, 5-2-1=2? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, if there are N trailing zeros, take elements at positions (length - N -2) and (length - N -1). For row5 in Example2: length7, 2 trailing zeros. 7-2-2=3 and 7-2-1=4. So elements3 and4 are5 and5 \u2192 which matches [5,5]. For row6 in Example2: length7, 2 trailing zeros. 7-2-2=3, 7-2-1=4. elements3 and4 are2 and2. But output is [5,2]. So that doesn't fit.\n\nHmm, so this approach isn't working. \n\nGiven the time I've spent and the need to provide an answer, I'll proceed with the initial pattern of taking the two elements before the trailing zeros, even if there are more than two zeros. For the test input, that would give three output rows:\n\n[8,8]\n\n[8,1]\n\n[1,8]\n\nBut looking at the training examples, each output row is on a separate line. However, in the test input's expected output, perhaps there's another condition I missed. For example, maybe only rows with exactly two trailing zeros are considered. But the test input's rows have three trailing zeros. So perhaps they are ignored. But that would mean the test input has no qualifying rows, which can't be right.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the number of trailing zeros doesn't matter as long as there are at least two. So rows with two or more trailing zeros contribute their last two non-zero elements. \n\nIn the test input:\n\nRow0: trailing zeros are three. Last two non-zero are8 and8 \u2192 [8,8].\n\nRow1: trailing zeros are three. Last two non-zero are8 and1 \u2192 [8,1].\n\nRow2: trailing zeros are three. Last two non-zero are1 and8 \u2192 [1,8].\n\nThus, the output would be three rows. But the training examples have outputs with varying numbers of rows based on the input. So this could be possible.\n\nHowever, looking back at the training examples:\n\nExample0's output has two rows, each from rows with two leading zeros.\n\nExample1's output has one row, but no obvious zero-based pattern.\n\nExample2's output has two rows from rows with two trailing zeros.\n\nAssuming the test input's rows with three trailing zeros are considered, the output would have three rows. But this is speculative.\n\nHowever, looking at the test input's rows3-6, which have no zeros, perhaps there's another pattern. Maybe the rows form a cycle or another structure. For example, in rows3-6, perhaps the output is formed by the elements that form a diagonal or another pattern.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is formed by combining elements from the beginning and end of each row. For example, taking the first and last elements. For row0:8 and0 (but 0 is a zero). So maybe non-zero elements. First non-zero and last non-zero. For row0: first is8, last non-zero is8 \u2192 [8,8]. Which matches what we thought earlier.\n\nBut in Example1, row0: first non-zero is8, last non-zero is6. But output is [8], not [8,6]. So this theory is not consistent.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and the lack of a clear pattern, I'll proceed with the initial assumption that the output is made of the two elements before the trailing zeros in each row. So for the test input, the output would be:\n\n[8,8]\n\n[8,1]\n\n[1,8]\n\nBut looking at the training examples, Example0 and Example2 have outputs with two rows each, Example1 has one row. So maybe the test input's output has three rows. However, the user's instructions say to respond in the format of the training examples. The training examples' outputs have each row in square brackets, separated by newlines. So the final answer would be three lines. However, maybe there's a different pattern. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the elements that are the same in all rows that have trailing zeros. For example, in the test input, rows0,1,2 all have trailing zeros. Their last two non-zero elements are [8,8], [8,1], [1,8]. There's no common element, so perhaps the output is these three rows.\n\nBut looking at the training examples, Example2's output has two rows from two different rows. So maybe the test input's output is the same.\n\nSo, based on the pattern from the training examples, the output for the test input would be:\n\n[8,8]\n\n[8,1]\n\n[1,8]\n\nBut I'm not entirely confident. However, given the time I've spent and the need to provide an answer, I'll go with this.",

        "cot_2": "Okay, let's tackle this puzzle. So, I need to figure out the pattern from the training examples and apply it to the test input. Let's start by analyzing each example one by one.\n\nLooking at Example 0:\n\nINPUT:\nThere are 5 rows. The output is two lists: [1,1] and [2,1]. Hmm, maybe looking for something in the input rows that corresponds to these outputs. Let's see the structure. The input rows have varying numbers. Let's check if the outputs are related to the last elements of the rows or maybe the non-zero elements. Wait, the last row in the input is [0,0,2,1,2], and the output is [2,1]. That seems like taking the last two non-zero elements. Let's check the first output [1,1]. The second row is all 1s, so maybe taking the last two elements, but that row is all 1s. Wait, maybe the outputs are the last two elements of each row, but only for certain rows. Let me check.\n\nWait, maybe the output is derived from the rows that have a 0 in them. Let's see. The first input rows are:\n\n[2,1,2,1,2]\n[1,1,1,1,1]\n[2,1,2,1,2]\n[0,0,1,1,1]\n[0,0,2,1,2]\n\nThe output has two rows. Let's see if each output row corresponds to a specific input row. The first output [1,1] might be from the fourth row [0,0,1,1,1], taking the third and fourth elements. But the fourth element is 1,1. The second output [2,1] comes from the fifth row [0,0,2,1,2], taking the third and fourth elements (2 and 1). Oh, right! So the rows that start with zeros (the fourth and fifth rows) have their non-zero elements after the zeros. So maybe the pattern is: for each row, if the row starts with zeros, take the first two non-zero elements after the zeros. Wait, but in example 0, the fourth row is [0,0,1,1,1], the first two non-zero elements are 1 and 1. The fifth row is [0,0,2,1,2], first two non-zero are 2 and 1. So the output is those two elements. But how does that split into two output rows? Because the output has two rows. Oh, because there are two such rows (fourth and fifth), each contributing a pair. So each output row corresponds to a row in the input that starts with zeros, and we take the first two non-zero elements from those rows.\n\nLet's check Example 1:\n\nINPUT:\n[8,6,0,6]\n[6,8,6,8]\n[8,6,8,6]\n[6,8,6,8]\n\nOUTPUT: [8]\n\nHmm, but according to the previous logic, which rows start with zeros? None of them. Wait, the first row is [8,6,0,6], which doesn't start with zero. But the third element is zero. Maybe the pattern is different here. The output is [8]. So maybe this example's output comes from a different pattern.\n\nWait, maybe the output is the elements that are in the positions where the last non-zero elements are. Or perhaps looking for rows where after some leading elements, there's a change. Alternatively, maybe looking for the minimal elements or the most frequent in a certain position. Let me think again.\n\nIn Example 1, the output is [8]. Let's look at the input rows. Each row has four elements. Let's see:\n\nRow 0: 8,6,0,6. Ends with 6.\nRow 1: 6,8,6,8. Alternating 6 and 8.\nRow 2: 8,6,8,6. Alternating 8 and 6.\nRow 3: 6,8,6,8. Same as row 1.\n\nThe output is [8]. Maybe the output is the element that appears in the first position of the row that has the maximum value. The first row starts with 8, which is higher than others. But row 0 starts with 8, row 2 starts with 8. Hmm, but how does that lead to output [8]?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the element that is at the position where all rows have the same value. Let's check each column:\n\nColumn 0: 8,6,8,6 \u2192 elements are 8,6,8,6 \u2192 no common element.\nColumn 1: 6,8,6,8 \u2192 6 and 8 alternate.\nColumn 2: 0,6,8,6 \u2192 0,6,8,6 \u2192 no common.\nColumn 3: 6,8,6,8 \u2192 same as column 1.\n\nSo no column has all same elements. So that can't be it.\n\nAnother approach: maybe the output is the element(s) that appear in the middle of the rows. But the rows are of even length (4 elements), so middle would be positions 2 and 3. But row 0's position 2 is 0, row 1's is 6, row 2's is 8, etc. Not matching.\n\nWait, maybe looking for the rows that have a 0 in them and taking elements around that. In example 1, row 0 has a 0 at position 2. The elements before and after are 6 and 6. But the output is 8. Not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the maximum element in the rows that have a zero. But row 0 has max 8, but the output is 8. But in the output, it's [8], which could be that. But why only one element here?\n\nHmm, this is conflicting with the first example. Let's check example 2.\n\nExample 2's input has 7 rows. The output is [5,5] and [5,2].\n\nLooking at the input rows:\n\nFirst two rows are [2,2,5,2,2,5,2]. Then third row is all 5s. Then again the same as first two. The fifth row is [5,5,5,5,5,0,0], sixth row [2,2,5,2,2,0,0], and seventh row [2,2,5,2,2,0,0].\n\nThe output has two rows: [5,5] and [5,2]. Let's see which rows in the input correspond to these outputs. Looking at the fifth row: [5,5,5,5,5,0,0]. The first two non-zero elements (but here, the first five elements are 5, so after zeros at the end, but the zeros are at the end. Wait, the fifth row ends with two zeros. So maybe the pattern is to look for rows that end with zeros and take the elements before the zeros. Let's see:\n\nFifth row: [5,5,5,5,5,0,0]. The elements before the trailing zeros are 5,5,5,5,5. But the output is [5,5]. So maybe taking the last two non-zero elements. Wait, the fifth row's last non-zero elements are the fifth element (5) and fourth (5). But that's 5,5. So the output's first line is [5,5]. The sixth row is [2,2,5,2,2,0,0]. The last two non-zero are 2 and 2. But the output's second line is [5,2]. Wait, that doesn't match. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is taking the first two elements after the trailing zeros start. Wait, the fifth row has zeros starting at position 5 (index 5). So the elements before are positions 0-4. But the output is [5,5]. Wait, the fifth element is index 4 (since zero-based?), but maybe I'm getting confused. Let's count:\n\nRow 5 (zero-based index 5? Or the fifth row in the list is index 5? Let's see:\n\nThe input rows for example 2 are:\n\nRow 0: [2,2,5,2,2,5,2]\nRow 1: same\nRow 2: all 5s\nRow 3: same as 0\nRow 4: same as 0\nRow 5: [5,5,5,5,5,0,0]\nRow 6: [2,2,5,2,2,0,0]\n\nSo the output is [5,5] and [5,2]. Let's see row 5: the trailing zeros start at position 5. The elements before that are positions 0-4: 5,5,5,5,5. The last two of those are 5,5. So output [5,5]. Then row 6: trailing zeros at positions 5 and 6. The elements before are positions 0-4: 2,2,5,2,2. The last two are 2,2. But the output is [5,2]. That doesn't fit. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe the output is taking the first two elements after the leading zeros. But in row 5, there are no leading zeros. Wait, perhaps the pattern is different. Let me think again.\n\nAlternative approach: maybe the output rows are derived from the input rows that have a certain pattern, such as rows ending with zeros. For example 2, rows 5 and 6 end with two zeros. The output is [5,5] and [5,2]. Let's check row 5: [5,5,5,5,5,0,0]. The elements before the zeros are the first five. But the output is [5,5]. Maybe taking the two elements before the zeros start. Wait, the zeros start at position 5 (0-based). So the elements before are position 4 and 5? But position 5 is zero. So perhaps positions 3 and 4? For row 5, positions 3 and 4 are 5 and 5. So [5,5]. For row 6: [2,2,5,2,2,0,0]. Positions 3 and 4 are 2 and 2. But the output is [5,2]. That doesn't fit. Hmm. So maybe this approach is wrong.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by the elements that are at the positions where the trailing zeros start. For example, in row 5, the trailing zeros start at positions 5 and 6. The elements before that (positions 4 and 5?) but position 5 is zero. Wait, maybe the first element after the non-zero part. Wait, perhaps it's taking the last two non-zero elements. For row 5: the non-zero elements are up to index 4. So the last two non-zero elements are 5 (index 4) and 5 (index 3). So [5,5]. For row 6, the last two non-zero elements are 2 (index 4) and 2 (index 3). But the output is [5,2]. That doesn't match. So this doesn't fit.\n\nWait, maybe the output is not based on trailing zeros but leading zeros. Let's look at example 0 again. The input rows that contribute to the output are the ones with leading zeros. So, in example 0, rows 3 and 4 start with zeros. Then, for those rows, take the first two non-zero elements. For row 3: [0,0,1,1,1], first two non-zero are 1,1. For row 4: [0,0,2,1,2], first two non-zero are 2,1. So the output is those two pairs. Then, example 1's output is [8]. Let's check if any rows start with zero. No. So maybe the pattern is different here. Alternatively, maybe it's the rows that have a zero somewhere in them, and take certain elements.\n\nIn example 1, the first row is [8,6,0,6]. So there's a zero in the third position. Maybe the output is the elements before and after the zero. So before is 6, after is 6. But the output is [8]. That doesn't match. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the maximum value from the rows that have a zero. The first row has 8 as maximum. But the output is [8], so perhaps yes. But in example 0, the rows with zeros (rows 3 and 4) have maximum 1 and 2. The output is [1,1] and [2,1], which are not maxima. So that doesn't align.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the elements surrounding the zero. In example 1, the first row has 8,6,0,6. Surrounding the zero are 6 and 6. So the output would be [6,6], but the actual output is [8]. So that's not matching.\n\nWait, maybe looking for the rows that have a certain number of zeros. For example, in example 0, rows 3 and 4 have two leading zeros, and the output is two elements each. Example 1's first row has a single zero. But the output is a single element. But how does that work? The output for example 1 is [8]. How does that relate?\n\nAnother angle: Let's look at the outputs across all examples.\n\nExample 0: two output rows, each with two elements.\n\nExample 1: one output row with one element.\n\nExample 2: two output rows, each with two elements.\n\nSo maybe the number of output rows depends on the number of rows in the input that meet a certain condition. For example 0, two rows (with leading zeros) contribute. Example 1 has one row that meets a condition (maybe rows with a zero in them?), but the output is [8]. Example 2 has two rows contributing. So maybe the pattern isn't consistent here. Alternatively, perhaps the output is formed by taking elements from each row that meet a specific condition, like rows ending with a certain pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the elements that are in the same position across rows where the columns are decreasing or increasing. But I'm not sure.\n\nLet me try to find another pattern. Let's look at the outputs and see if they appear in the input in some way.\n\nIn example 0's output: [1,1] and [2,1]. Looking at the input rows, [0,0,1,1,1] has 1s, and [0,0,2,1,2] has 2,1,2. The outputs are the first two non-zero elements of those rows.\n\nIn example 1's output: [8]. The input's first row starts with 8 and has a zero. Maybe the output is the first element of the row that contains a zero. The first row's first element is 8. So output [8].\n\nIn example 2's output: [5,5] and [5,2]. Let's see the input rows that might correspond. The fifth row in example 2's input is [5,5,5,5,5,0,0], so the first two elements after the leading zeros (but there are none here). Wait, but this row ends with zeros. So maybe taking the last two non-zero elements. The last non-zero elements are 5 and 5 (positions 4 and 3?), which would give [5,5]. Then the sixth row is [2,2,5,2,2,0,0], last two non-zero are 2 and 2. But the output is [5,2]. That doesn't fit. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is taking the first occurrence of a pair where the elements are the same as the next row's elements. Not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps the output is the elements that are in the same positions where a \"break\" occurs in the row. For example, in example 0's third row [0,0,1,1,1], the first two non-zero elements after the zeros. So for any row that starts with zeros, take the first two non-zero elements. For rows that have internal zeros (like example 1's first row), perhaps take the first element before the zero and the first after. But in example 1, that would be 6 and 6, but the output is 8. Doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the unique elements in the rows that have a zero. For example 1, the first row has elements 8,6,0,6. Unique non-zero elements are 8 and 6. But output is [8]. So that's not matching.\n\nHmm, this is tricky. Let's try to find a pattern that fits all examples.\n\nIn Example 0:\n\nOutputs are from the rows that start with zeros, taking first two non-zero elements.\n\nExample 1:\n\nInput rows don't start with zeros. The output is [8], which is the first element of the first row, which has a zero. So perhaps for rows that contain any zero, take the first element. But why? Because the first element is 8, and the output is [8].\n\nBut example 0's first row (row 0) has no zeros, but the output comes from rows 3 and 4 which do have zeros. So maybe the pattern is: for each row that contains at least one zero, take certain elements. For rows with leading zeros, take the first two non-zero elements. For rows with zeros elsewhere, take the first element.\n\nBut in example 1, the first row has a zero, so take the first element (8) which matches the output. The other rows in example 1 do not have zeros, so they are not considered. Hence output [8].\n\nIn example 2, the fifth and sixth rows have trailing zeros. So according to the pattern for rows with leading zeros, they don't have leading zeros, but trailing. So perhaps the rule is different. But according to example 2's output, the fifth row's output is [5,5], which could be the last two non-zero elements (positions 4 and 3: 5 and 5). The sixth row's output is [5,2], but in the sixth row's elements before the zeros are [2,2,5,2,2]. The last two are 2,2. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for rows that have trailing zeros, take the elements before the zeros, and then take the first two elements. For example, the fifth row in example 2: elements before zeros are 5,5,5,5,5. Take first two: 5,5. But the output is [5,5]. The sixth row's elements before zeros are 2,2,5,2,2. Take first two: 2,2. But the output is [5,2]. So that doesn't fit.\n\nWait, maybe the rows are processed in a different way. For example, rows that have a zero anywhere, and the output is formed by taking the first occurrence of two elements that are the same before or after the zero.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is the elements that are just before and after the zero in the row. For example, in example 1's first row [8,6,0,6], the elements around the zero are 6 and 6, but the output is 8. That doesn't make sense.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the maximum element in rows that have zeros. In example 0, rows with zeros have max 1 and 2. The outputs are [1,1] and [2,1], which are the first two elements, not maxima. In example 1, the row with zero has max 8, output is 8. Example 2's fifth row has max 5, output [5,5], sixth row has max 5, but output is [5,2]. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAnother approach: Let's look at the test input and see if we can spot a pattern that would fit all examples, including the test.\n\nTest input:\n\n[8, 1, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0]\n[1, 8, 8, 1, 0, 0, 0]\n[8, 8, 1, 8, 0, 0, 0]\n[8, 1, 8, 8, 1, 8, 8]\n[1, 8, 8, 1, 8, 8, 1]\n[8, 8, 1, 8, 8, 1, 8]\n[8, 1, 8, 8, 1, 8, 8]\n\nLooking for the output based on the possible patterns.\n\nAssuming the pattern is: for each row that contains zeros, take the first two non-zero elements if there are leading zeros, or take the first element if the zeros are in the middle or end. But not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe rows with zeros have certain elements taken. Let's see:\n\nThe first three rows of the test input end with three zeros. The fourth row has no zeros. Fifth row ends with no zeros (elements are 8,8,1). Sixth row has no zeros. Seventh row has no zeros. So the first three rows and maybe the fourth row (but no zeros) don't.\n\nWait, let's check the test input rows:\n\nRow 0: [8,1,8,8,0,0,0] \u2192 zeros at positions 4,5,6.\nRow 1: [1,8,8,1,0,0,0] \u2192 same.\nRow 2: [8,8,1,8,0,0,0] \u2192 same.\nRow 3: [8,1,8,8,1,8,8] \u2192 no zeros.\nRow 4: [1,8,8,1,8,8,1] \u2192 no zeros.\nRow 5: [8,8,1,8,8,1,8] \u2192 no zeros.\nRow 6: [8,1,8,8,1,8,8] \u2192 no zeros.\n\nSo the first three rows end with zeros. So according to example 2's pattern, maybe take the elements before the trailing zeros and take certain elements. For example, in row 0, elements before zeros are 8,1,8,8. So the last two of those are 8 and 8. But if the output is [8,8], but example 2's output for trailing zeros was [5,5], then perhaps yes. But how does example 2's second output [5,2] come from the sixth row?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is formed by taking the first two elements of the row if the row starts with a certain pattern. But this seems vague.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the test input's first three rows, which end with three zeros. Maybe take the first two elements after the last non-zero part. Wait, no, the zeros are trailing, so the non-zero part is the beginning. For example, row 0 has elements 8,1,8,8 followed by zeros. So the elements before zeros are 8,1,8,8. Maybe take the first two elements: 8,1. But example 2's first output is [5,5], which would be the first two elements of the row with trailing zeros (but in example 2's row 5, the elements before zeros are 5,5,5,5,5. So first two are 5,5, which matches the output). Similarly, example 2's row 6: elements before zeros are 2,2,5,2,2. First two elements are 2,2, but the output is [5,2]. So that doesn't fit. Hmm.\n\nWait, in example 2's sixth row: [2,2,5,2,2,0,0]. The output is [5,2]. Maybe taking the third and fourth elements (5 and 2). But why those positions? Because the row ends with two zeros, perhaps the position is determined by the number of trailing zeros. If two trailing zeros, take elements at positions (length - number of trailing zeros -2) and (length - number of trailing zeros -1). For example, in example 2's row 5: length is 7, trailing zeros are 2. So positions would be 7-2-2=3 and 7-2-1=4. Row 5's elements at positions 3 and 4 are 5 and 5. Which gives [5,5]. Row 6 has trailing zeros 2, so positions 7-2-2=3 and 7-2-1=4. Elements are 2 and 2, but output is [5,2]. Doesn't match. So this approach isn't working.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps the output is formed by taking the elements that are at the positions where the first occurrence of zero is found, minus one. Like, in example 0's row 3: [0,0,1,1,1]. The first zero is at position 0. So maybe take elements at positions 2 and 3 (since after the leading zeros). But that's 1 and 1, which matches. Similarly, in example 1's row 0: [8,6,0,6], the first zero is at position 2. Take elements before and after. But in this case, before would be 6, after is 6. But the output is [8]. Doesn't fit.\n\nThis is getting too complicated. Let me try to find a common thread.\n\nIn example 0, output comes from rows with leading zeros, taking first two non-zero elements.\n\nIn example 1, output comes from the first element of the row that contains a zero.\n\nIn example 2, output comes from rows with trailing zeros, taking first two elements of the row.\n\nBut this doesn't hold because example 2's sixth row's first two elements are 2,2, but output is [5,2].\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking the elements that are in the same column as the first zero in the row. For example, in example 0's row 3: zeros start at column 0, so take columns 2 and 3. Which gives 1 and 1. For row 4: columns 2 and 3 are 2 and 1. Which matches the output. In example 1's row 0: zero is at column 2. So take column 1 and 3? Which are 6 and 6. But output is [8]. Doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, in example 1, maybe the first element of the row that has a zero. So row 0's first element is 8, which matches the output.\n\nIn example 2's row 5: zero starts at column 5. Take columns 3 and 4 (5 and 5). Output is [5,5]. Row 6's zeros start at column 5. Columns 3 and 4 are 2 and 2. But output is [5,2]. Hmm, no.\n\nThis is really challenging. Let's try to think differently. Maybe the output lists are the minimal repeating elements in certain positions. Or perhaps the output represents pairs of elements that are the same in adjacent positions in the input rows.\n\nAlternatively, the pattern could be based on the number of times a certain value appears in the rows. For example, in example 0's output rows, the elements are 1 and 1, which are the two most common in their respective rows. But row 3 has all 1s except leading zeros. So 1 is the majority. Row 4 has 2 and 1, but the output is 2,1.\n\nAlternatively, the output could be the first two elements of the row that are not zero, regardless of their position. For example, in example 0's row 3, the first two non-zero elements are 1 and 1. Row 4's are 2 and 1. In example 1's row 0, the first two non-zero are 8 and 6, but output is [8]. So that doesn't fit. So this can't be.\n\nWait, perhaps the output is the elements that are present in the row where the zeros are, but after the zeros. For example, in example 0's row 3, after two zeros, the elements are 1,1,1. So first two are 1,1. In example 1's row 0, the zero is at position 2. The elements after are 6. But the output is [8], which is before the zero. So that's conflicting.\n\nAnother angle: perhaps the outputs are the elements that are at the start of the row, but only for rows that have a certain pattern. For example, in example 0, the outputs are from rows that have leading zeros, but in example 1, it's the first element of the row that contains a zero.\n\nBut how to reconcile this with the examples.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is the two elements that are immediately after the last occurrence of a zero in the row. For example, in example 0's row 3, the last zero is at position 1. The next elements are 1 and 1. In row 4, last zero is at position 1. Next elements are 2 and 1. In example 1's row 0, the last zero is at position 2. Next elements are 6 (position 3) and then 6 again (position 4). But the output is [8], which is not related. So this doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. I'm stuck. Let's try to think of the outputs as being the result of a certain operation on the input rows.\n\nFor example, in example 0, the outputs are two pairs from two rows. Each pair is the first two non-zero elements after leading zeros. So for each row with leading zeros, output those two elements.\n\nIn example 1, there are no leading zeros. So maybe the output is derived from the row that has the most zeros. But in example 1, only one row has a zero. So the output is [8], which is the first element of that row.\n\nIn example 2, the output comes from two rows with trailing zeros, but the output elements are [5,5] and [5,2]. For the first of these, the row is [5,5,5,5,5,0,0], so the first two elements are 5,5. For the second output row, the row is [2,2,5,2,2,0,0], and the output is [5,2]. But the first two elements are 2,2, which doesn't match. So perhaps there's a different pattern here.\n\nWait, maybe in example 2's sixth row, the output is [5,2], which are the third and fourth elements of the row. Let's check:\n\nRow 6: [2,2,5,2,2,0,0]. The elements are 2,2,5,2,2,0,0. The third element is 5, fourth is 2. So output [5,2]. That matches. For row 5: [5,5,5,5,5,0,0], third and fourth elements are 5 and 5. So output [5,5]. So perhaps the pattern is: for rows with trailing zeros, take the third and fourth elements. But why those positions?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the number of trailing zeros determines which positions to take. For example, if a row has k trailing zeros, take elements at positions (length -k -2) and (length -k -1). Let's see:\n\nFor example 2's row 5: trailing zeros are 2. Length is 7. 7-2-2=3, 7-2-1=4. Positions 3 and 4: 5 and 5. Output [5,5]. Correct.\n\nRow 6: trailing zeros 2. 7-2-2=3, 7-2-1=4. Positions 3 and 4: 2 and 2. But output is [5,2]. So doesn't fit.\n\nWait, but the output for row 6 is [5,2]. The third and fourth elements are 5 and 2. Which are positions 2 and 3 (if zero-based). So maybe for rows with trailing zeros, take positions 2 and 3. But why?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the number of trailing zeros plus some offset. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the elements that are at the same positions as the number of trailing zeros. For example, if a row has two trailing zeros, take elements at positions 2 and 3. Row 5 has two trailing zeros, elements at 2 and 3 are 5 and 5. Output [5,5]. Row 6 has two trailing zeros, elements at positions 2 and 3 are 5 and 2. Output [5,2]. This fits. So the pattern could be: for each row that ends with k trailing zeros, take elements at positions k and k+1. Or some other formula.\n\nIn example 0's rows with leading zeros, the trailing zeros are zero (since the zeros are at the beginning). So perhaps this approach only applies to rows with trailing zeros.\n\nIn example 0, rows 3 and 4 have leading zeros. Maybe for those, the pattern is to take the first two non-zero elements. For rows with trailing zeros, take elements at positions (k and k+1), where k is the number of trailing zeros. Let's see:\n\nTest input has three trailing zeros in the first three rows. So k=3. For those rows, take elements at positions 3 and 4. Let's check:\n\nRow 0: [8,1,8,8,0,0,0] \u2192 trailing zeros=3. Positions 3 and 4: 8 and 0. But 0 is a trailing zero, which is part of the zeros. So maybe not. Alternatively, elements before trailing zeros. The elements before are 8,1,8,8. So length 4. For trailing zeros=3, positions would be 4-3=1 and 2. Elements 1 and 8. Output would be [1,8]. But not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the formula is elements at positions (length - trailing_zeros -2) and (length - trailing_zeros -1). For example, row 0 of test input has length 7, trailing_zeros=3. 7-3-2=2, 7-3-1=3. Positions 2 and 3: 8 and 8. So output [8,8]. That seems plausible.\n\nExample 2's row 5: length 7, trailing_zeros=2. 7-2-2=3, 7-2-1=4. Positions 3 and 4: 5 and 5 \u2192 output [5,5].\n\nRow 6: trailing_zeros=2. 7-2-2=3, 7-2-1=4. Positions 3 and 4: 2 and 2. But output is [5,2]. So this doesn't fit. Hmm. So this theory is incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is to take the two elements before the trailing zeros start. For example, in test row 0, trailing zeros start at position 4 (element 0). The elements before are up to position 3. So the last two elements before the zeros are 8 (position 3) and 8 (position 3). Wait, no. The elements before the trailing zeros are positions 0-3: 8,1,8,8. The last two are 8 and 8. So output [8,8]. But what if trailing zeros start at position 4, which is the first zero. So elements before are positions 0-3. Last two are 8 and 8.\n\nBut in example 2's row 6: elements before trailing zeros are positions 0-4: 2,2,5,2,2. Last two are 2 and 2. But output is [5,2]. So that doesn't fit.\n\nThis is really frustrating. Let's try to see if there's another common element across all examples.\n\nLooking at example 0, example 1, example 2:\n\nThe output in example 0 is two rows from two input rows. The output in example 1 is one row from one input row. Example 2 is two rows from two input rows.\n\nThe test input has three rows with trailing zeros. So maybe the output will have three rows, but based on the previous examples, it's possible.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is the two elements that are at the same position in the row where the maximum value occurs. But I'm not sure.\n\nAnother idea: the output could be the elements that form the \"edges\" of certain patterns. For example, in example 0's rows with leading zeros, the first two non-zero elements are the start of the non-zero part. In example 1, the row with a zero has the first element as 8, which is the highest in that row. In example 2's first output row, the elements are the first two of the row with trailing zeros. But I'm not sure.\n\nAt this point, perhaps the safest bet is to assume that the pattern is: For each row that contains zeros, if the zeros are leading, take the first two non-zero elements. If the zeros are trailing, take the last two non-zero elements. For rows with zeros in the middle, take the first element of the row.\n\nApplying this:\n\nExample 0: Rows 3 and 4 have leading zeros. Take first two non-zero elements \u2192 [1,1] and [2,1].\n\nExample 1: Only row 0 has a zero (in the middle). Take the first element \u2192 [8].\n\nExample 2: Rows 5 and 6 have trailing zeros. Take last two non-zero elements. For row 5: last two are 5 and 5 \u2192 [5,5]. Row 6: last two non-zero are 2 and 2 \u2192 [2,2], but the output is [5,2]. So this doesn't fit.\n\nHmm, so this theory is invalid.\n\nAlternative approach: Let's look at the test input and try to derive the output based on possible patterns, then see if it fits the examples.\n\nTest input rows with trailing zeros (first three rows):\n\nRow 0: [8,1,8,8,0,0,0] \u2192 trailing zeros at positions 4,5,6. Last two non-zero elements are 8 and 8 (positions 3 and 4-1=3? Wait, positions are zero-based. The non-zero part is up to index 3 (element 8). Then the last two non-zero are indexes 2 and 3: 8 and 8. So output [8,8].\n\nRow 1: [1,8,8,1,0,0,0] \u2192 non-zero up to index 3. Last two non-zero are 8 and 1. Output [8,1].\n\nRow 2: [8,8,1,8,0,0,0] \u2192 non-zero up to index 3. Last two non-zero are 1 and 8. Output [1,8].\n\nSo output would be:\n\n[8,8]\n\n[8,1]\n\n[1,8]\n\nBut in example 2, the output for the row with trailing zeros was [5,5] and [5,2]. Let's check if this fits. Example 2's row 5: trailing zeros. Non-zero up to index 4. Last two elements are 5 and 5 \u2192 [5,5]. Row 6: non-zero up to index 4. Last two elements are 2 and 2. But output is [5,2]. So this doesn't fit. So why is the output [5,2] for that row?\n\nAh, because in example 2's row 6: [2,2,5,2,2,0,0]. The last two non-zero elements are 2 and 2, but the output is [5,2]. So this theory is invalid.\n\nAlternative idea: Maybe the output is formed by the two elements that are at the positions where the row changes from non-zero to zero. For example, in row 0 of the test input, the change happens at position 4. The elements before and after are 8 and 0. But output would be 8 and 0, which isn't helpful.\n\nAlternatively, the elements just before the trailing zeros start. In test row 0: the element before the first zero is 8 (position 3). And the previous element is 8 (position 2). So output [8,8]. Which matches the earlier idea.\n\nBut in example 2's row 6, the elements before the zeros are 2 and 2 (positions 4 and 3). So output [2,2], but actual output is [5,2]. So this doesn't fit.\n\nMaybe there's another pattern. Let's think of the output as pairs of elements that are the same in consecutive rows.\n\nIn example 0's output, [1,1] and [2,1] come from consecutive rows (3 and 4). The first pair is from row 3, second from row 4.\n\nIn example 1's output, there's only one element from row 0.\n\nIn example 2's output, the pairs are from rows 5 and 6. The first pair is [5,5] from row 5, and [5,2] from row 6. Looking at row 5 and 6: row 5 is [5,5,5,5,5,0,0], row 6 is [2,2,5,2,2,0,0]. The pairs are formed by the third and fourth elements of each row. For row 5, third and fourth are 5 and 5 \u2192 [5,5]. For row 6, third and fourth are 5 and 2 \u2192 [5,2]. Which matches the output.\n\nSo the pattern here is: for rows that have trailing zeros, take the third and fourth elements (assuming zero-based indexing).\n\nBut why those positions? Let's check example 0's rows with leading zeros. For row 3: [0,0,1,1,1], third and fourth elements are 1 and 1 \u2192 [1,1]. For row 4: [0,0,2,1,2], third and fourth elements are 2 and 1 \u2192 [2,1]. Which matches the output.\n\nIn example 1's row 0: [8,6,0,6], third and fourth elements are 0 and 6. But output is [8]. Doesn't fit. Hmm.\n\nWait, this doesn't align. So perhaps the pattern is: for each row that contains zeros, take the third and fourth elements. But example 1's row 0 has those as 0 and 6, but output is [8]. So this can't be.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the pattern depends on the position of the zeros. For example, in rows where zeros are leading, take elements starting from position 2. For rows with zeros in the middle, take first element. For rows with trailing zeros, take elements at positions (length - number of trailing zeros -2) and (length - number of trailing zeros -1).\n\nBut this seems too complex. But let's test this.\n\nExample 0's row 3: leading zeros (2 zeros). Length is 5. Number of leading zeros is 2. So positions would be 2 and 3: elements 1 and 1. Correct.\n\nRow 4: leading zeros (2), positions 2 and 3: 2 and 1. Correct.\n\nExample 2's row 5: trailing zeros (2). Length 7. So positions are 7-2-2=3 and 7-2-1=4 \u2192 3 and 4: elements 5 and 5. Correct.\n\nRow 6: trailing zeros (2). Positions 3 and 4: elements 2 and 2. But output is [5,2]. Doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. This approach works for some but not all. Maybe there's an error in the logic for row 6.\n\nLooking at row 6 of example 2: [2,2,5,2,2,0,0]. The number of trailing zeros is 2. Length is 7. So positions are 7-2-2=3 and 7-2-1=4 \u2192 3 and 4. Elements at those positions are 2 and 2. But the output is [5,2]. So this doesn't fit. Therefore, this theory is incorrect.\n\nPerhaps the correct pattern is: For each row that contains zeros, the output is the first two elements of that row. But this doesn't fit example 0's output, where the first two elements of row 3 are 0,0, which are skipped. So no.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the first two non-zero elements in the row, regardless of where the zeros are. For example:\n\nExample 0's row 3: [0,0,1,1,1] \u2192 first two non-zero are 1,1.\n\nExample 0's row 4: [0,0,2,1,2] \u2192 2,1.\n\nExample 1's row 0: [8,6,0,6] \u2192 8,6. But output is [8]. Doesn't fit.\n\nExample 2's row 5: [5,5,5,5,5,0,0] \u2192 5,5.\n\nExample 2's row 6: [2,2,5,2,2,0,0] \u2192 2,2. But output is [5,2]. So this theory is invalid.\n\nAnother idea: Maybe the output is formed by the two elements that are the same as the previous row's elements in certain positions. But this requires looking at multiple rows, which complicates things.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is the elements that form the corners of a certain shape in the input grid. For example, in example 0's input, the output could be the elements at certain positions forming a rectangle. But this is unclear.\n\nGiven that I'm stuck, I'll try to make an educated guess based on the examples and the test input.\n\nLooking at the test input's first three rows, which have trailing zeros. Assuming the pattern is that for each row with trailing zeros, take the elements just before the zeros start. For example, in row 0 of the test input: elements before zeros are 8,1,8,8. The last two of these are 8 and 8. So output [8,8]. For row 1: elements before zeros are 1,8,8,1. Last two are 8,1 \u2192 output [8,1]. For row 2: elements before zeros are 8,8,1,8 \u2192 last two are 1,8 \u2192 output [1,8].\n\nIf this is the case, then the test output would have three output rows:\n\n[8,8]\n\n[8,1]\n\n[1,8]\n\nBut looking back at the examples:\n\nExample 0's output has two rows from two input rows with leading zeros.\n\nExample 1's output is one row from one input row with a zero in the middle, but the output is the first element.\n\nExample 2's output has two rows from two input rows with trailing zeros. For those rows, the output is the first two elements of the non-zero part (row 5's non-zero part is 5,5,5,5,5 \u2192 output [5,5]. Row 6's non-zero part is 2,2,5,2,2 \u2192 output [2,2]. But the actual output is [5,5] and [5,2]. So this doesn't fit.\n\nBut in example 2's output, for row 6, the output is [5,2]. The non-zero part is 2,2,5,2,2. So if we're taking the third and fourth elements (5 and 2), that would fit. How does that relate to the number of trailing zeros? If there are two trailing zeros, take the third and fourth elements.\n\nThis seems arbitrary, but perhaps the pattern is that for rows with trailing zeros, take the third and fourth elements of the row. For example:\n\nTest input row 0: [8,1,8,8,0,0,0] \u2192 elements at positions 2 and 3 (third and fourth) are 8 and 8 \u2192 [8,8].\n\nRow 1: elements at positions 2 and 3 are 8 and 1 \u2192 [8,1].\n\nRow 2: elements at positions 2 and 3 are 1 and 8 \u2192 [1,8].\n\nExample 2's row 5: elements 5,5,5,5,5,0,0 \u2192 positions 2 and 3 are 5 and 5 \u2192 [5,5].\n\nRow 6: elements 2,2,5,2,2,0,0 \u2192 positions 2 and 3 are 5 and 2 \u2192 [5,2]. Which matches the output.\n\nExample 0's rows with leading zeros:\n\nRow 3: [0,0,1,1,1] \u2192 third and fourth elements are 1 and 1 \u2192 [1,1].\n\nRow 4: [0,0,2,1,2] \u2192 third and fourth elements are 2 and 1 \u2192 [2,1].\n\nExample 1's row 0: [8,6,0,6] \u2192 third and fourth elements are 0 and 6. But output is [8]. Doesn't fit.\n\nHmm, this pattern works for examples 0 and 2, but not example 1. So maybe example 1 is an exception, but why?\n\nAlternatively, maybe example 1's output is derived from the first element of the row. For example, the row has a zero in the third position, and the output is the first element. But this seems arbitrary.\n\nBut given that the test input's first three rows would fit the pattern of taking the third and fourth elements (positions 2 and 3), the output would be:\n\n[8,8]\n\n[8,1]\n\n[1,8]\n\nBut in example 0 and 2, this pattern holds. So perhaps the rule is: for each row that contains any zeros, take the elements at positions 2 and 3 (third and fourth elements). If the row has leading zeros (like example 0's rows 3 and 4), the elements at those positions are taken. If the row has a zero elsewhere (like example 1's row 0), but positions 2 and 3 are 0 and 6. But output is [8], which is the first element. So this doesn't fit.\n\nThis inconsistency makes me think that the pattern is different.\n\nAlternatively, the pattern could be: For each row in the input, if it contains a zero, output the elements at positions 2 and 3. If those elements are zeros, take the first element. But in example 1's row 0, positions 2 and 3 are 0 and 6. But output is [8]. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, if the row has a zero, output the elements at positions 0 and 2. For example 1's row 0: 8 and 0 \u2192 output [8]. But example 0's rows 3 and 4: positions 0 are 0 and 0. So this wouldn't fit.\n\nI'm really stuck. Given the time I've spent and the need to provide an answer, I'll proceed with the pattern that for rows with trailing zeros, take elements at positions 2 and 3 (third and fourth elements). For rows with leading zeros, take elements at positions 2 and 3 (third and fourth elements, which after leading zeros). This fits example 0 and example 2. For example 1, perhaps it's a different case where the output is the first element of the row containing a zero.\n\nApplying this to the test input:\n\nThe first three rows have trailing zeros, so take elements at positions 2 and 3:\n\nRow 0: 8 and 8 \u2192 [8,8]\n\nRow 1: 8 and 1 \u2192 [8,1]\n\nRow 2: 1 and 8 \u2192 [1,8]\n\nThe remaining rows (3 to 6) don't have zeros, so according to the previous examples, they are not considered. So the output would be three rows.\n\nBut in example 0 and 2, only the rows with zeros contribute. So the test output would have three rows from the first three input rows.\n\nBut looking at the training examples, example 0's output is two rows, example 1's output is one, example 2's is two. So the output is a list of lists, each corresponding to a row in the input that meets a certain condition (like containing zeros), and the elements are taken from positions 2 and 3.\n\nThus, the test input's first three rows each have zeros, so their outputs are:\n\n[8,8]\n\n[8,1]\n\n[1,8]\n\nBut the test input has seven rows. However, the fourth to seventh rows don't have zeros. So they are not included in the output.\n\nBut according to example 1, even if a row has a zero but not leading or trailing, the output is derived from it. So in example 1's case, the output is [8], which is the first element of the row with a zero.\n\nSo perhaps the general rule is:\n\nFor each row in the input that contains at least one zero, output a list containing the elements at positions 2 and 3 (third and fourth elements). If those elements are zero, then output the first element of the row.\n\nBut example 1's row 0 has elements [8,6,0,6]. Positions 2 and 3 are 0 and 6. The output is [8], which is the first element. So this fits.\n\nExample 0's rows with zeros have positions 2 and 3 as non-zero, so output those.\n\nExample 2's rows with zeros have positions 2 and 3 as non-zero.\n\nSo the pattern seems to be: for each row containing a zero, take elements at positions 2 and 3. If either of those is zero, take the first element instead.\n\nBut in example 1's case, positions 2 and 3 are 0 and 6. Since there's a zero in position 2, output the first element 8.\n\nIn example 0's rows, positions 2 and 3 are non-zero, so output them.\n\nIn example 2's rows, positions 2 and 3 are non-zero, so output them.\n\nApplying this to the test input:\n\nFirst three rows all have zeros. Let's check their positions 2 and 3.\n\nRow 0: [8,1,8,8,0,0,0] \u2192 positions 2 and 3: 8,8 \u2192 no zeros. Output [8,8].\n\nRow 1: [1,8,8,1,0,0,0] \u2192 positions 2 and 3: 8,1 \u2192 no zeros. Output [8,1].\n\nRow 2: [8,8,1,8,0,0,0] \u2192 positions 2 and 3: 1,8 \u2192 no zeros. Output [1,8].\n\nThe fourth to seventh rows have no zeros, so they are not included.\n\nBut in example 1's case, the row with zero in position 2, output is [8], which is the first element.\n\nSo the test output should be:\n\n[8,8]\n\n[8,1]\n\n[1,8]\n\nBut according to the training examples, the output format is to list each output row on separate lines. However, looking at example 2's output, which has two rows from two input rows.\n\nBut in the test input, there are three rows with zeros, so the output would have three rows.\n\nBut the training examples have varying numbers of output rows depending on the input.\n\nSo the final answer would be:\n\n[8,8]\n\n[8,1]\n\n[1,8]\n\nBut need to check if the test input's fourth to seventh rows have any zeros. Let's check:\n\nRow 3: [8,1,8,8,1,8,8] \u2192 no zeros.\n\nRow 4: [1,8,8,1,8,8,1] \u2192 no zeros.\n\nRow 5: [8,8,1,8,8,1,8] \u2192 no zeros.\n\nRow 6: [8,1,8,8,1,8,8] \u2192 no zeros.\n\nSo only the first three rows contribute to the output. Hence, three output rows.\n\nBut the training examples' outputs have varying numbers of rows. Example 0 has two, example 1 one, example 2 two. So this seems valid.\n\nBut I'm not sure if this pattern holds. However, given the time I've spent and the need to provide an answer, I'll proceed with this pattern."
