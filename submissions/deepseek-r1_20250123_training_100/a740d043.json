        "cot_1": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. So, there are these training examples where each input is a grid of numbers, and the output is another grid. My job is to find out how the input maps to the output so I can apply the same logic to the test input.\n\nLooking at the first example, Example 0. The input is a 5x7 grid. The output is a 3-row array. Let me see what the input rows look like. The first row is all 1s. The second row has 1s and two 2s. The third row has 1s, two 2s, and a 3. The fourth row is back to mostly 1s with a 2. The fifth row is all 1s again. The output is three rows: [2,2,0], [2,2,3], [0,0,2]. Hmm. Maybe the output is capturing some kind of blocks or sequences in the input. \n\nLooking at the output rows for Example 0: the first output row has 2,2,0. Maybe the first two numbers are the values of some elements in the input, and the third is something else. Wait, maybe it's about the maximum value in certain regions? Or perhaps the count of numbers different from 1?\n\nWait, let's look at the positions. The input grid in Example 0 has some 2s and a 3. The output has three rows. Maybe each output row corresponds to a specific region in the input. For instance, the first output row [2,2,0] could relate to the 2s in the second and third rows. The third element being 0 might indicate something about the surrounding. Alternatively, maybe it's about the layers or concentric rectangles in the grid. \n\nLooking at the second example, Example 1. The input is a 7x7 grid. The output has two rows: [3,0,2] and [3,0,2]. The input has some 3s and 2s in the middle. So maybe the output is capturing the non-1 values in specific positions. In the input of Example 1, rows 2 and 3 have 3s and 2s. The output has two rows, each [3,0,2]. Maybe 3 is the value in a certain column, 0 could be a placeholder, and 2 another value. Or perhaps it's grouping certain elements.\n\nExample 2's input has a 7x6 grid. The output has three rows: [5,5], [5,5], [6,6]. The input has 5s in rows 3 and 4, and 6s in row 5. The output seems to list these pairs. So maybe the pattern is that each output row corresponds to a consecutive pair of rows in the input that have the same non-1 values. For example, in Example 2, rows 3 and 4 (5s) and row 5 (6s) but only paired as two rows. Wait, the output here has three rows, but the input has 5,5 in rows 3 and 4, then 6,6 in row 5. The output lists [5,5], [5,5], [6,6]. Hmm, maybe each consecutive pair of rows with the same non-1 numbers is converted into a row in the output. But how does that work? Or maybe for each group of consecutive rows that have a non-1 number, the output is the value and the number of times it appears? But in Example 2, the output has three rows. Wait, the input for Example 2 has three sets: rows 3 and 4 have 5s, row 5 has 6s. So the output lists each pair. But the output is three rows: two [5,5] and one [6,6]. Maybe each row in the output corresponds to a horizontal pair in the input. Wait, maybe each output row is the maximum value in a certain region. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is derived by looking for the non-1 values in each column, starting from the top. Let's take Example 0. The input grid has columns. For example, the first column is all 1s except row 2,3,4. Wait, perhaps looking at each column, and for each column, wherever there is a non-1 value, the output records those, but in some grouped way. But how does that lead to the output arrays?\n\nWait, maybe it's about the positions of non-1 numbers. Let's think of the input as layers. For example, in Example 0, the non-1 numbers form a sort of \"island\". The output could be the coordinates or the values in certain positions of those islands. But the output is in rows, not coordinates.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is capturing the \"contours\" of the non-1 regions. For example, in Example 0, the 2s are forming a block, and the 3 is in the middle. The output might list the maximum value in each layer. For instance, the first layer (outermost) has 2s, then next layer has 2 and 3, etc. But how does that translate to the output rows?\n\nWait, let's look at the output for Example 0. The output has three rows. Let's check the input rows that have non-1 values. The input rows 1,2,3 have 2s and a 3. The output rows are [2,2,0], [2,2,3], [0,0,2]. Maybe each output row corresponds to a horizontal trio of cells. For instance, looking at the input's third row: [1,2,2,3,1,1,1]. The middle three elements are 2,2,3. But the first output row is [2,2,0], which might be 2,2, then zero if there's nothing else. Hmm, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the values of the non-1 cells in each \"ring\" or concentric rectangle around the center. For example, in a grid, the outermost layer, then the next layer, etc. For Example 0, which is 5 rows by 7 columns. The center would be around row 3. The first ring might be the perimeter, but maybe the non-1 numbers form a certain shape. But I'm not seeing a clear pattern here.\n\nLet me try another approach. Let's look at the output arrays and see how they relate to the input. Take Example 2's output:\n\n[5,5]\n[5,5]\n[6,6]\n\nThe input has in rows 3 and 4: [1,5,5,1,1,1] each. So two rows of 5s. Then row 5 is [1,6,6,1,1,1]. The output has two rows of [5,5], then one [6,6]. That suggests that each pair of consecutive rows with the same non-1 values (5,5) is represented as a row in the output. But in Example 2, the first two 5 rows would generate two output rows? Wait, but the input has two rows (3 and 4) with 5s. So the output has two [5,5] rows and one [6,6] for the single 6 row. Wait, maybe each consecutive occurrence of a non-1 number in the same position across adjacent rows is grouped. For example, if two consecutive rows have the same value in the same column, then that's captured in the output. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is constructed by taking each horizontal pair of non-1 numbers in the input grid. For example, in Example 2, the 5s are in pairs in the same row (columns 2 and 3). Each row with such a pair becomes an output row. But why are there two [5,5] entries in the output for the two rows (3 and 4) with 5s. So each row's pair is added as a row in the output, and then the row with 6s is added once. That matches the output. So for Example 2, three output rows: two from the two 5 rows, one from the 6 row.\n\nLet's check Example 1. Input has rows 2 and 3: [1,1,3,1,2,1,1]. So in these rows, the third column is 3, fifth is 2. The output is two rows of [3,0,2]. Wait, 3 and 2 are the non-1 values. The 0 might indicate that there's a gap between them. So perhaps in the output, each row represents a horizontal triplet of non-1 values. For example, in the input rows 2 and 3, the non-1 values are 3 and 2, separated by a 1 (0 in output maybe represents 1). So [3,0,2] would be 3, then 0 (since between 3 and 2 is a 1), then 2. But why two rows of the same thing? Because the input has two consecutive rows (2 and 3) with the same non-1 pattern. So each of those rows contributes a [3,0,2] to the output.\n\nSimilarly, in Example 0, the output rows are [2,2,0], [2,2,3], [0,0,2]. Let's look at the input rows. The second row is [1,2,2,1,1,1,1]. The non-1 values are 2,2. So perhaps the output row is [2,2,0], with 0 indicating no third value. Then the third row has 2,2,3. So the output is [2,2,3]. The fourth row has a single 2, so maybe [0,0,2], where the first two are 0s (1s in input) and then the 2. But why three elements? Or perhaps it's grouping the non-1 values in vertical triplets.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each output row corresponds to a 3x3 block in the input. For example, the output captures the non-1 values in these blocks. But the output lengths vary, so that's unclear.\n\nAnother angle: the output seems to have rows where the elements are non-1 numbers from the input, arranged in the order they appear in some path. Like, maybe a spiral or row-wise traversal, but grouped into chunks. For instance, in Example 0, the output rows have 2,2,0; then 2,2,3; then 0,0,2. If we imagine traversing the input and collecting the non-1 numbers, but grouping them in triplets. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output rows represent the non-1 values in each diagonal or some other structure. But the examples don't immediately suggest that.\n\nWait, let's look at the test input to see if that helps. The test input is:\n\n[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]\n[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]\n[1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1]\n[1, 1, 2, 3, 1, 1]\n[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]\n[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]\n\nSo, rows 3 and 4 (0-based or 1-based?) have 2 and 3. Let's assume rows are 0-based. So third row (index 2) is [1,1,1,2,1,1], fourth row (index3) is [1,1,2,3,1,1]. The output should be generated based on the pattern.\n\nIf the pattern from the examples is that each consecutive row with non-1 values contributes an output row, then in the test input, rows 2 and 3 have non-1 elements. Row 2 has a 2, row 3 has 2 and 3. Let's see.\n\nIn Example 0, the output rows seem to correspond to the non-1 values in each consecutive row. For instance, the first output row [2,2,0] comes from the second row (2,2,1s), perhaps. Then the third row has 2,2,3, leading to [2,2,3]. Fourth row has a 2, leading to [0,0,2], which might be padding with zeros for missing elements.\n\nSimilarly, in the test input:\n\nRow 2 (third row) has a single 2 in column 4 (if columns are 0-based). So maybe the output row is [0,0,2], but how? Then row 3 (fourth row) has 2 and 3. So perhaps [2,3,0], but that's not matching the examples.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is capturing the non-1 values in a vertical slice. For example, looking at columns where there are non-1 values. In the test input, the 2 and 3 are in columns 3 and 4 (assuming 0-based). Let's see:\n\nIn row 2, column 3 is 2. In row 3, columns 2 and 3 are 2 and 3. So maybe the output captures the vertical progression. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe each output row represents a diagonal of non-1 elements. For example, in the test input, the 2 in row 2, column3 is part of a diagonal with the 2 in row3, column2 and the 3 in row3, column3. So maybe the output is [2,2,3], but that's similar to Example 0.\n\nLooking back at Example 0's output, the third output row is [0,0,2], which corresponds to the fourth row of the input, which has a 2. So maybe each output row is the three elements in a vertical slice. For example, for each column, if there are non-1 values in consecutive rows, they are grouped. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is capturing the non-1 values in a 3x3 window that moves through the input. For each 3x3 block, extract certain elements. But how would that lead to the example outputs?\n\nAnother thought: the output rows have lengths that vary, but in the examples, the first example's output rows have three elements each, the second example's rows have three elements each, and the third example's rows have two elements each. The test input's output is to be determined. Maybe the number of elements in each output row corresponds to the number of non-1 values in a certain area of the input.\n\nWait, in Example 0's input, the non-1 values form a sort of pyramid. The second row has two 2s, the third row has two 2s and a 3, the fourth row has a 2. The output has three rows. The first output row [2,2,0] could represent the two 2s and then a zero (maybe the next value is 1, so zero?), but not sure. The third element in the output rows sometimes is zero. Maybe it's capturing the center and the surrounding? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by considering the non-1 values in each layer of the grid. For instance, the outermost layer (perimeter) is scanned, then the next layer, etc. For example, in Example 0, the grid is 5 rows by 7 columns. The perimeter would be all the 1s except for the middle parts. Wait, the input's non-1 values are in the middle. So maybe each output row corresponds to a layer. But how?\n\nAnother approach: let's look at the output for each example and see if there's a pattern in their elements.\n\nExample 0's output:\n[2,2,0]\n[2,2,3]\n[0,0,2]\n\nThe numbers here are 2,2,0, then 2,2,3, then 0,0,2. The 2s and 3 correspond to the input's non-1 numbers. The zeros might indicate where 1s are present. Maybe the output is the non-1 numbers in a certain order, with zeros filling in for 1s. For example, if we take three consecutive cells in a row, and replace 1s with 0s. But how?\n\nLooking at the input of Example 0's second row: [1,2,2,1,1,1,1]. If we take the non-1 numbers, we get 2,2. To make three elements, perhaps pad with a 0. So [2,2,0]. Then the third row has 2,2,3 \u2192 [2,2,3]. The fourth row has a single 2 \u2192 [0,0,2], perhaps padding with two zeros. That matches the output. So the pattern could be: for each row in the input that has non-1 numbers, take those numbers, pad with zeros to make a triplet, and each such triplet becomes a row in the output. If the row has more than three non-1 numbers, perhaps truncate? But in the examples given, each row with non-1 numbers has up to three non-1 numbers.\n\nLet's check Example 1. The input has rows 2 and 3 (assuming rows are 0-based) as [1,1,3,1,2,1,1]. The non-1 numbers are 3 and 2. So for each of these rows, the output is [3,0,2], which is taking the 3 and 2 and inserting a zero between them. So the output rows are [3,0,2] twice, corresponding to the two input rows with non-1 numbers. That makes sense.\n\nExample 2: the input rows with non-1 numbers are rows 3,4,5 (assuming 0-based?), which have 5,5 in rows 3 and 4, and 6,6 in row5. Each of these rows has two non-1 numbers. The output rows are [5,5], [5,5], [6,6]. So in this case, instead of padding to three elements, the output rows have two elements. So why the difference? Because the input rows have two non-1 numbers. So perhaps the output row length depends on the number of non-1 elements in the input row. If there are two, the output row has two elements (no padding); if there are three, three elements; if one, then pad with zeros to make three? But in Example 0's fourth row (with one 2), the output is [0,0,2]. Wait, but in that case, the non-1 numbers are one, so the output is a triplet with zeros and the single 2. So maybe the rule is: for each row in the input that contains non-1 numbers, create an output row where each element is the non-1 value, and any missing elements are filled with zeros. But the length of the output row depends on the maximum number of non-1 values in any row. But in Example 2, each row with non-1 values has two elements, so the output rows are pairs. But in Example 0, the rows have two or three non-1 values. So the maximum there is three, so each row's output is padded to three elements. Example 1's non-1 per row are two, but the output rows are three elements. Hmm, that complicates things.\n\nWait, Example 1's output rows are [3,0,2]. The input rows each have two non-1 elements (3 and 2), but they are separated by a 1. So maybe the output is capturing the sequence of non-1 elements in each row, replacing the 1s with 0s. So in the row [1,1,3,1,2,1,1], the non-1 elements are 3 and 2, with a 1 between them. So the output captures that as 3, 0 (for the 1), 2. That would make sense. So the output row is the non-1 elements and the 1s in between, but 1s are replaced by 0s. Wait, but the output row for Example 1's rows is [3,0,2], which would correspond to 3, 0, 2. But the input row has 3, then 1, then 2. So 3, 1 (0), 2. So yes, replacing 1s between non-1 elements with 0. But how about if there are more than one 1s between non-1 elements? For example, if a row is [3,1,1,2], would the output be [3,0,0,2], but the example outputs don't have such cases.\n\nBut let's check Example 0's second row: [1,2,2,1,1,1,1]. The non-1 elements are 2,2. The output row is [2,2,0]. So in this case, there's no 1 between them. So the output is [2,2,0]. Wait, but why the 0? Maybe the output is the first three non-1 elements in the row, padded with zeros if there are fewer than three. But in this row, there are two non-1 elements, so pad with one zero to make three. The third row of Example 0's input has three non-1 elements (2,2,3), so the output is [2,2,3]. The fourth row of the input has one non-1 element (2), so the output is [0,0,2]. So it's padded with two zeros. So the pattern seems to be: for each row in the input that has non-1 elements, take those elements, and if there are fewer than three, pad the output row with zeros to the right to make three elements. If there are more than three, maybe truncate. But in the examples provided, none of the input rows have more than three non-1 elements. So this could be the pattern.\n\nBut in Example 2, the output rows are pairs. Wait, in Example 2, the input rows with non-1 elements are:\n\nRow 2 (0-based): [1,5,5,1,1,1] \u2192 two 5s.\n\nRow 3: [1,5,5,1,1,1] \u2192 two 5s.\n\nRow 4: [1,6,6,1,1,1] \u2192 two 6s.\n\nSo for each of these rows, the non-1 elements are two in count. According to the previous pattern, each output row should have three elements, padded with zeros. But in Example 2's output, the rows are [5,5], [5,5], [6,6]. So two elements each, not three. This contradicts the earlier hypothesis.\n\nSo maybe the rule is different. Let's re-examine the examples.\n\nExample 0's output has three elements per row. The input rows with non-1 elements have two, three, and one elements. So padded to three. Example 1's output has three elements per row. The input rows have two non-1 elements, but in the row, the elements are 3, 1, 2. So the 1 is in between, replaced by 0. So the output row is 3,0,2. So three elements. Example 2's output has two elements per row, but in the input rows, each row has exactly two non-1 elements. So perhaps the output rows are the non-1 elements without padding. But why in Example 0 and 1 they are padded, and in Example 2 they are not?\n\nWait, maybe the number of output elements depends on the position of the non-1 elements. For example, if the non-1 elements are contiguous, then they are taken as is. If they are separated by 1s, the 1s are replaced by 0s. Let's check.\n\nExample 0's second row: [1,2,2,1,1,1,1]. The non-1 elements are contiguous. So output is [2,2,0]. Wait, why the 0 here? Maybe because there are three positions considered. Let's see. Maybe the output is considering the three middle columns. For example, in a 7-column grid, the middle three columns are 3,4,5 (0-based). But no, in Example 0's second row, the 2s are in columns 1 and 2. So perhaps that's not it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is the sequence of non-1 elements, but split into chunks of three, with any remaining elements forming a chunk. But Example 0's second row has two non-1 elements, so a chunk of two. But the output is three elements. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAnother approach: looking at the output rows, their lengths are 3,3,2. The input rows' non-1 elements have varying numbers. So perhaps the output rows are formed by taking the non-1 elements of each row, and grouping them such that consecutive elements in the same row are part of the same output row. For example, if a row has two non-1 elements, then they form a row in the output. If another row has three, they form another row. But in Example 0, the third input row has three non-1 elements, so the output row is [2,2,3], and the fourth row has one, so [0,0,2]. So why zeros here? It's possible that the output is formed by taking the non-1 elements of each row, and padding with zeros to make a triplet. But why in Example 2, the output is pairs. Because in Example 2's input, each row with non-1 elements has two elements, so they are not padded. But this is conflicting.\n\nWait, perhaps the key difference is the number of columns in the input. Example 0's input has 7 columns, Example 2's input has 6 columns. Maybe the output is determined by taking the middle three columns for grids with odd number of columns, and middle two for even. Let's check:\n\nExample 0's input is 7 columns, so middle three are columns 2,3,4 (0-based: 2,3,4). For the second row of Example 0's input: [1,2,2,1,1,1,1]. Columns 1,2,3,4: 2,2,1,1. Middle three are columns 2,3,4: 2,1,1. But the output row is [2,2,0]. Doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, the output rows are formed by taking the non-1 elements from the middle three elements of each row. For a 7-column row, middle three are positions 2,3,4. For a 6-column row, middle two are positions 2 and 3. Let's check:\n\nExample 0's second row has elements at positions 1 and 2 as 2s. Middle three are positions 2,3,4. The elements there are 2,1,1. But the output row is [2,2,0], which doesn't align. So that's not the case.\n\nAnother Idea: Perhaps the output captures the connected regions of non-1 values. Each connected region is represented by a row in the output, listing the values in the region. For example, in Example 0, the 2s form a connected region (possibly including the 3), so the output rows are their values. But how does that translate to the exact output rows?\n\nAlternatively, the output is the sequence of numbers encountered when moving from left to right, top to bottom, skipping 1s. So for Example 0's input, the sequence would be 2,2,2,2,3,2. Then grouped into rows of three, two, three, etc. But the output rows are [2,2,0], [2,2,3], [0,0,2], which don't match this.\n\nWait, in Example 0's input, the non-1 elements are:\n\nRow 1: 2,2 (positions 1,2)\n\nRow 2: 2,2,3 (positions 1,2,3)\n\nRow 3: 2 (position 3)\n\nSo the sequence would be 2,2,2,2,3,2. Grouping into chunks of three: [2,2,2], [2,3,2]. But the output is different. So that's not it.\n\nAnother approach: the output might be the count of each non-1 number in each concentric layer of the grid. For example, in Example 0, the layers could be the perimeter, then next layer, etc. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the output rows correspond to the rows of the input that have non-1 elements. For each such row, the output row is the non-1 elements, and 0s for the 1s in between. Let's check:\n\nExample 0's input has non-1 elements in rows 1,2,3 (assuming 0-based). For row 1: [1,2,2,1,1,1,1]. Non-1 are 2,2. Output row [2,2,0].\n\nRow 2: [1,2,2,3,1,1,1]. Non-1 are 2,2,3. Output row [2,2,3].\n\nRow 3: [1,1,1,2,1,1,1]. Non-1 is 2. Output row [0,0,2].\n\nThis matches. So each output row corresponds to an input row that has non-1 elements, and in that row, the non-1 elements are listed with 0s in between if there are 1s separating them. For example, in Example 1's input rows 2 and 3 (0-based?), which have non-1 elements 3 and 2 separated by a 1, the output row is [3,0,2]. Since the input rows are consecutive and have the same pattern, the output has two identical rows.\n\nIn Example 2, the input rows with non-1 elements have 5,5 and 6,6. So for each row, the non-1 elements are 5,5 and 6,6, leading to output rows [5,5], [5,5], [6,6]. Since there are two rows with 5s, each contributes a [5,5] row, and one row with 6s contributes [6,6].\n\nSo the pattern seems to be:\n\n- For each row in the input that contains non-1 elements, create an output row.\n\n- In the output row, replace each 1 with 0, and leave non-1 values as they are. So the output row is the sequence of elements from the input row, but with 1s replaced by 0s and non-1s retained. But only including the elements between the first and last non-1 elements of the row, padding with 0s as needed.\n\nWait, let's clarify. For each input row that has at least one non-1 element:\n\n- The output row is the sequence of elements from the input row, starting from the first non-1 element to the last non-1 element in that row, replacing 1s with 0s, and retaining non-1s.\n\nBut how does this apply to the examples?\n\nExample 0's row 1: [1,2,2,1,1,1,1]. The first non-1 is at index1 (2), last non-1 is index2 (2). So the elements from index1 to index2: [2,2]. Replace any 1s in between with 0s, but there are none here. But the output is [2,2,0]. Hmm, so that doesn't fit.\n\nAnother Idea: perhaps the output row is the entire input row, but with 1s replaced by 0s and only the non-1 elements (and zeros in between) are kept, removing trailing zeros. Wait, but in Example 0's first output row [2,2,0], which comes from the input row [1,2,2,1,1,1,1], if we replace 1s with 0s, we get [0,2,2,0,0,0,0]. Then, perhaps trim leading and trailing zeros to get [2,2]. But the output is [2,2,0], which suggests that maybe we take the first three elements after replacing 1s with 0s. For example, in the input row, after replacement, it's [0,2,2,0,0,0,0]. Take the first three elements (0,2,2), but that's [0,2,2], which doesn't match the output [2,2,0].\n\nAlternatively, the output is the non-1 elements, and the 1s between them are replaced by 0s. So in Example 0's row 1 (input row with [1,2,2,1, ... ]), the non-1 elements are 2,2. There's a 1 after them, but maybe the output is just the non-1 elements. But the output is [2,2,0]. So not sure.\n\nLet me take Example 1's input row: [1,1,3,1,2,1,1]. The non-1 elements are 3 and 2, separated by a 1. So the output row is [3,0,2]. This suggests that between the 3 and 2, the 1 is replaced by a 0. So the output row is the non-1 elements and the intervening 1s replaced by 0s. So the output row is the sequence of non-1 elements with 0s inserted for any 1s that are between them. Leading and trailing 1s are ignored. So for this row, the non-1 elements are 3 and 2, with a 1 in between. So output is 3,0,2.\n\nExample 0's row 1: non-1 elements are two 2s, no 1s between them. So output is [2,2,0]. Wait, why the 0? Unless the rule is to have a fixed length of three, padding with zeros. So if there are two non-1 elements, then pad with one zero. If three, no padding. If one, pad with two zeros.\n\nSo the pattern would be:\n\nFor each row in the input that has at least one non-1 element:\n\n- Extract the non-1 elements, and any 1s between them replaced by 0s.\n\n- Then, if the length is less than three, pad with 0s to make it three.\n\n- If the length is more than three, truncate to three.\n\nBut Example 2's output rows are pairs. So this contradicts. Unless Example 2's input rows are treated differently. Let's see:\n\nExample 2's input rows:\n\nRow 2: [1,5,5,1,1,1] \u2192 non-1 elements 5,5. No 1s between them. So output row would be [5,5,0], but the output is [5,5]. So this suggests the padding rule isn't consistent.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output rows are the non-1 elements with no padding. So for Example 0's row 1, output is [2,2]. But the example output for Example 0's first row is [2,2,0]. So that's a problem.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Let's think of another angle. Maybe the output rows represent the horizontal sequences of non-1 numbers in the input grid, but each output row corresponds to a vertical group of non-1 numbers. For example, in Example 0, the 2s form a vertical stack in columns 1 and 2 across rows 1-3, and the 3 is in row 2, column3. So the output rows could be representing these vertical groups.\n\nBut how does that lead to the output rows as given? For example, the first output row [2,2,0] could be the first two 2s and a 0, perhaps indicating the base of the vertical stack. The second row [2,2,3] might be the next level up, including the 3. The third row [0,0,2] could be the top of the vertical stack. But this is speculative.\n\nAlternatively, the output is counting the number of occurrences of each non-1 value in certain regions. For example, in Example 0, the output rows might represent the number of 2s and 3 in different sections. But this doesn't explain the exact numbers in the output.\n\nAlternatively, the output is the result of a convolution operation. For example, each output element is the sum of a 3x3 kernel applied to the input. But the examples don't support this.\n\nAnother Idea: The output rows might represent the diagonals of the non-1 elements. For example, in Example 0's input, the non-1 elements form a sort of diagonal pattern, and the output captures these. But I'm not seeing a clear diagonal pattern in the examples.\n\nAlternatively, the output rows are the non-1 elements from each \"island\" in the input. For instance, each connected region of non-1 values is considered an island, and the output rows list the values of these islands. But in Example 0, there's one island of 2s and a 3. The output rows might list the values in some order.\n\nBut how does that lead to the three output rows in Example 0? The island could be the 2s and the 3. The output rows might be layers of the island. For example, the first layer is the outer 2s, then the next layer has the inner 2s and the 3, then the single 2 in the fourth row. But this is not clear.\n\nLet's try to apply the hypothesis of padding each row's non-1 elements to three elements, replacing 1s with 0s, to the test input.\n\nTest input:\n\nRow 2: [1,1,1,2,1,1] \u2192 non-1 elements: 2. So output row would be [2,0,0] but padded to three elements. Or if the rule is to capture the sequence between the first and last non-1 elements. In this row, the 2 is at position 3. So between first and last (same position), the sequence is [2]. But according to the earlier examples, if there's a single non-1 element, the output row would be [0,0,2], like in Example 0's fourth row.\n\nRow 3: [1,1,2,3,1,1] \u2192 non-1 elements are 2 and 3. They are adjacent. So the output row would be [2,3,0], but according to Example 0's third row, which has three non-1 elements, it's [2,2,3]. Wait, no. In Example 1, two non-1 elements separated by a 1 become [3,0,2]. So for two non-1 elements adjacent, perhaps the output row is [2,3,0], padded to three elements.\n\nSo for the test input:\n\nRow 2 has a single 2 \u2192 output row [0,0,2].\n\nRow 3 has 2 and 3 \u2192 output row [2,3,0].\n\nBut according to the training examples, Example 1 has two rows with non-1 elements, each producing [3,0,2]. So maybe the test input's output would have two rows: [0,0,2] and [2,3,0]. But the example outputs vary in the number of output rows. For example, Example 0's output has three rows corresponding to three input rows with non-1 elements.\n\nBut the test input has two such rows (rows 2 and 3). So the output would have two rows: [0,0,2] and [2,3,0]. But looking at the training examples, Example 0's output rows are three, which correspond to three input rows with non-1 elements. Example 1's output has two rows, corresponding to two input rows. Example 2's output has three rows, corresponding to three input rows.\n\nSo applying this pattern, the test input's output would be two rows: [0,0,2] and [2,3,0]. But wait, in the test input's row 3, the non-1 elements are 2 and 3, adjacent. So according to Example 1's case where non-1 elements are separated by a 1, leading to a 0 in between. But in the test input's row 3, the 2 and 3 are adjacent, no 1 between them. So the output row would be [2,3,0], padded to three elements. So the two output rows would be:\n\n[0,0,2]\n\n[2,3,0]\n\nBut looking at the training examples, especially Example 0, where a row with a single non-1 element produces [0,0,2], and a row with two non-1 elements produces [2,2,0] (if adjacent) or [3,0,2] (if separated by a 1). So the test input's row 3 has two adjacent non-1 elements (2 and 3), so the output row would be [2,3,0]. But this isn't present in the training examples. Example 0's row 1 has two adjacent non-1 elements (2,2), output row [2,2,0]. So padding with a zero at the end. So for two adjacent non-1 elements, the output row is the two elements followed by a zero. So in the test case's row 3, the output would be [2,3,0].\n\nThus, the test input's output would be two rows:\n\n[0,0,2]\n\n[2,3,0]\n\nBut looking at the training example 0's output, when there is a single non-1 element, the output row is [0,0,2]. For two adjacent non-1 elements, it's [2,2,0]. For three non-1 elements, it's [2,2,3]. \n\nIn the test input's case, the two output rows would be:\n\nFor row 2: [0,0,2]\n\nFor row 3: [2,3,0]\n\nSo the output would be:\n\n[0, 0, 2]\n\n[2, 3, 0]\n\nBut let's check the training examples for alignment. Example 1's output has two rows of [3,0,2], which comes from non-1 elements 3 and 2 separated by a 1. So the 1 is replaced by 0. In the test input's row 3, the non-1 elements are adjacent, so no zeros in between, just appended.\n\nSo the final output would be:\n\n[0,0,2]\n\n[2,3,0]\n\nBut looking at the required response format, the examples' outputs are presented as lists. So the answer should be two output rows. But looking back at the training examples, the output sometimes has varying row lengths. For example, Example 2's output has rows of two elements. So perhaps the number of elements in each output row depends on the number of non-1 elements in the corresponding input row. For example, if the input row has two non-1 elements, the output row has two elements. If it's three, then three. But in Example 0's row 1 has two non-1 elements but output row has three. So that contradicts.\n\nThis is perplexing. Maybe the pattern is that each output row corresponds to a contiguous block of non-1 elements in the input row. For example, in a row, if there are multiple contiguous blocks of non-1 elements, each block becomes a separate output row. But in the examples, each row has a single block. Example 0's row 1 has a block of two 2s. Row 2 has a block of two 2s and a 3. Row 3 has a single 2. So each block becomes an output row. The output row is the values in the block, padded with zeros to a length of three. So for two elements, pad with one zero. For three elements, no padding. For one element, pad with two zeros. \n\nIf that's the case, then the test input's row 2 has a single 2, output row [0,0,2]. Row 3 has a block of two elements (2 and 3), so output row [2,3,0]. So the output would be:\n\n[0,0,2]\n\n[2,3,0]\n\nBut how does this fit with Example 2's output? In Example 2's input rows, each row has a block of two non-1 elements. So according to this pattern, each would be padded to three elements. But the output rows are [5,5], [5,5], [6,6], each of length two. So this contradicts.\n\nThis suggests that the padding rule is not consistent across examples, which is confusing. Perhaps there's another factor I'm missing.\n\nLooking back at Example 2's input:\n\nThe input is a 7x6 grid. The output is three rows: [5,5], [5,5], [6,6]. The input rows with non-1 elements are:\n\nRow 2: [1,5,5,1,1,1]\n\nRow 3: [1,5,5,1,1,1]\n\nRow 4: [1,6,6,1,1,1]\n\nEach of these rows has two non-1 elements. The output rows for these are pairs, not triplets. So why are these output rows not padded to three elements?\n\nMaybe the difference is the number of columns. Example 0 and 1 have 7 columns (odd), Example 2 has 6 columns (even). So for odd columns, the output rows have three elements; for even columns, two elements. Let's check:\n\nExample 0's input has 7 columns, output rows are triplets.\n\nExample 1's input has 7 columns, output rows are triplets.\n\nExample 2's input has 6 columns, output rows are pairs.\n\nYes, this seems to fit. So the number of elements in each output row is determined by the number of columns in the input. For even columns, it's half (like 6/2=3, but output rows are pairs. Wait, 6 columns would have three middle columns. Maybe not. Let me think:\n\nIf the input has an even number of columns, perhaps the output rows take the middle two elements. For example, 6 columns have middle positions 2 and 3 (0-based). For 7 columns, middle three positions are 2,3,4.\n\nSo for each input row that has non-1 elements, the output row is the middle elements of that row (based on the column count), with 1s replaced by 0s and non-1s retained. \n\nLet's test this hypothesis:\n\nExample 0 has 7 columns. Middle three positions are 2,3,4. For row 1: [1,2,2,1,1,1,1]. Middle three elements are 2,1,1. Replacing 1s with 0s gives [2,0,0]. But the output row is [2,2,0]. So this doesn't fit.\n\nExample 2 has 6 columns. Middle two positions are 2 and 3. For row 2: [1,5,5,1,1,1]. Middle two elements are 5 and 1 \u2192 replaced 1 with 0 \u2192 [5,0]. But the output row is [5,5]. So this also doesn't fit.\n\nSo this idea is incorrect.\n\nAlternative Idea: The output rows are the non-1 elements of the input grid's rows, but only considering the leftmost and rightmost non-1 elements and the elements in between. For each such row, replace 1s with 0s and retain non-1s. The length of the output row depends on the distance between the first and last non-1 elements in the row. \n\nFor example, in Example 0's row 1: non-1 elements at positions 1 and 2. So distance is 2-1=1, so the output row length is 2+1=3 (positions 1, 2, and any in between). So the elements are 2 (pos1), 2 (pos2), and between them there's no element. But since they are adjacent, there's nothing in between. So maybe fill with 0s for any positions in between. But in this case, the positions are consecutive, so there are no positions in between. So the output row would be [2,2, 0], where the third element is padding to three.\n\nIn Example 0's row 2: non-1 elements at positions 1,2,3. So the output row is [2,2,3], no padding needed.\n\nIn Example 0's row 3: non-1 element at position3. So output row is [0,0,2] (pad two zeros to the left).\n\nIn Example 1's input rows 2 and 3: non-1 elements at positions2 (3) and position4 (2). So the distance is 4-2=2. So the output row length is 3 (positions2,3,4). The elements are 3 (pos2), 1 (pos3 \u2192 0), 2 (pos4), so output row [3,0,2].\n\nIn Example 2's input rows: non-1 elements at positions1 and2. So distance 1. Output row length is 2. Elements are 5,5 \u2192 output [5,5]. But the output in Example 2 is [5,5], [5,5], [6,6]. So this aligns.\n\nTest input's row 2: non-1 element at position3. So output row length is 1. But according to the previous examples, this would be padded to three elements \u2192 [0,0,2]. \n\nRow3 of test input has non-1 elements at positions2 and3. Distance is 1. So output row length 2. Elements 2,3. So output [2,3]. But according to the previous examples, how would this be handled? In Example 0's row1, distance1, output row was [2,2,0] (length3). In Example 2's rows, distance1, output row was [5,5] (length2). So inconsistency here. \n\nThis suggests that the pattern depends on the number of columns. For example, in even columns, output rows are length2, for odd columns, length3. The test input has 6 columns (even), so output rows would be length2. But row2 of test input has a single non-1 element. So according to Example2's handling of a single non-1 element (row5: [1,6,6,1,1,1] \u2192 output row [6,6], which is two elements). But that row has two non-1 elements. So that's different.\n\nWait, in Example2's row5 (input row4): [1,6,6,1,1,1] \u2192 two non-1 elements. So output row [6,6]. If a row has a single non-1 element, but in a grid with even columns, how is it handled? Perhaps padded to two elements. For example, in the test input's row2, single 2 \u2192 output row [0,2], padding with a zero in front. But according to Example0's row3, single 2 leads to [0,0,2]. So depends on column count.\n\nBut the test input has 6 columns (even). So for each row with non-1 elements, the output row would have two elements. But how to determine which two elements to take.\n\nFor even columns (6), perhaps the middle two columns are 2 and3 (0-based). So for each row, take the middle two elements (columns2 and3). If they are non-1, use them. Otherwise, replace with 0. So for Example2's row2: middle two are 5 and5 \u2192 output [5,5]. Test input's row2: middle two columns are 2 and3. The elements are 1 and2. So replace 1 with0 \u2192 [0,2]. Row3's middle two columns are2 and3: elements 2 and3 \u2192 output [2,3]. \n\nBut according to this, the test input's output would be two rows:\n\n[0,2]\n\n[2,3]\n\nBut the examples don't have this. For example, Example0's output is based on the entire row's non-1 elements, not the middle columns.\n\nThis is getting too speculative. Let me try to summarize what I think is the most consistent pattern based on the examples:\n\n- For each row in the input that contains non-1 elements, create an output row.\n\n- In the output row, replace all 1s with 0s and retain non-1 values.\n\n- Then, trim leading and trailing zeros.\n\n- If the resulting row is empty, omit it.\n\n- However, the examples show that even after trimming, some zeros remain. For example, Example0's first output row is [2,2,0], which suggests that trailing zeros are not trimmed.\n\nAlternatively, the output row is formed by taking the non-1 elements and the 1s between them (replaced by 0s) and padding with zeros to match the maximum number of non-1 elements in any row of the input. But this also varies.\n\nAnother possibility is that the output rows are the non-1 elements and the 1s between them, replaced by 0s, and then the output row is formed by taking the first three elements (or two, depending on columns) of this sequence. For example:\n\nExample0's row1: non-1 elements are 2,2. Between them, no 1s. So sequence is [2,2]. Take first three elements \u2192 [2,2,0].\n\nExample0's row2: non-1 elements 2,2,3 \u2192 take first three \u2192 [2,2,3].\n\nExample0's row3: non-1 element 2 \u2192 sequence [2] \u2192 take first three \u2192 [2,0,0]. But output is [0,0,2]. So this doesn't align.\n\nThis is getting too time-consuming. Given the time constraints, I'll make a educated guess based on the examples.\n\nFor the test input:\n\nThe non-1 elements are in rows 2 and 3 (0-based):\n\nRow2: [1,1,1,2,1,1] \u2192 non-1 is 2 at position3.\n\nRow3: [1,1,2,3,1,1] \u2192 non-1 elements at positions2 and3 (2 and3).\n\nFollowing the pattern from Example0's row3 (single 2 \u2192 [0,0,2]) and row2 (two non-1 elements \u2192 [2,2,0]):\n\nRow2's output would be [0,0,2].\n\nRow3's output would be [2,3,0].\n\nThus, the output would be two rows:\n\n[0, 0, 2]\n\n[2, 3, 0]\n\nBut in Example2, each row with two non-1 elements results in a pair. So why the discrepancy? Because Example2 has even columns, test input has even columns. Maybe in even columns, the output rows are pairs. So in the test input, for row3's two non-1 elements, output is [2,3].\n\nRow2's single non-1 element would be padded to two elements. How? Example2's rows with two non-1 elements output pairs. For a single element, perhaps pad with a zero. So row2's output would be [0,2].\n\nThus, the output would be:\n\n[0,2]\n\n[2,3]\n\nBut this doesn't align with Example0's handling of single elements. This is confusing.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and the need to provide an answer, I'll proceed with the initial hypothesis that for each row with non-1 elements, create an output row by replacing 1s with 0s and take the non-1 elements, padding to three elements for odd columns and two for even.\n\nTest input has even columns (6), so output rows should be two elements. For row2's single 2 \u2192 pad with zero to two elements: [0,2].\n\nRow3's two non-1 elements \u2192 [2,3].\n\nSo output:\n\n[0, 2]\n\n[2, 3]\n\nBut looking at Example2's output for a single row with two non-1 elements, the output is [6,6]. So two elements. But in the test input's row3, two non-1 elements are 2 and3, so output [2,3].\n\nThus, the final answer would be:\n\n[0, 2]\n\n[2, 3]\n\nBut how does this align with the training examples' formatting? The training examples have outputs with varying row lengths. For example, Example2's output has three rows, each with two elements. The test input has two rows with non-1 elements. So the output should be two rows. \n\nBut according to the examples, Example0's output has three rows, each with three elements. Example1's output has two rows, each with three elements. Example2's output has three rows, each with two elements.\n\nSo the test input's output would have two rows. If the input has even columns (6), the output rows have two elements each.\n\nThus, the test input's output would be:\n\n[0,2]\n\n[2,3]\n\nBut formatted as in the examples, using brackets and commas:\n\n[0, 2]\n\n[2, 3]\n\nBut looking back at the examples, Example2's output uses [5,5], [5,5], [6,6], which are exactly the non-1 elements from each row. So for even columns, the output rows are the non-1 elements without padding.\n\nIn the test input's case:\n\nRow2's non-1 elements: [2] \u2192 since it's even columns, output row is [2]? But Example2's rows with two non-1 elements output [5,5], so perhaps for even columns, the output row is the non-1 elements, regardless of their number. But in Example2, each row with non-1 elements has two, so output is pairs. If a row has one, then output is a single element. But this is not observed in the examples.\n\nBut Example0's row3 has one non-1 element and outputs [0,0,2], which is three elements. So perhaps the number of elements is determined by the input row's non-1 elements count, padded to three for odd columns and two for even.\n\nThus, in the test input's case:\n\nRow2: one non-1 element \u2192 even columns \u2192 pad to two \u2192 [0,2].\n\nRow3: two non-1 elements \u2192 even columns \u2192 [2,3].\n\nSo output:\n\n[0, 2]\n\n[2, 3]\n\nBut this isn't present in any training example. But given the time constraints, this seems the best guess.",

        "cot_2": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. So, the task is to map the input grids to the output grids based on the training examples. Let's look at each example one by one.\n\nStarting with Example 0. The input is a 5x7 grid. The output is three rows. The first output row is [2,2,0]. Hmm. Looking at the input rows:\n\nThe first row is all 1s. Then the next row has 2s in positions 2 and 3. Then the third row has 2s again and a 3. The fourth row has a 2 in position 4. The output rows seem to be capturing the values of non-1 elements in certain regions. Wait, maybe it's looking for contiguous blocks of numbers other than 1 in each layer and then outputting their values and counts? Or perhaps it's about the positions where the numbers change.\n\nWait, another angle. Let's check the outputs. For Example 0's output, the first line [2,2,0] could correspond to the second row of the input. The input's second row has two 2s. But why 2,2,0? Maybe the first number is the value, the second is the count, and the third something else. But in Example 0's output, the third element is 0 in the first line. Alternatively, maybe each output row represents a cluster of numbers. For example, in the input of Example 0, the first output row [2,2,0] might be the two 2s in row 2, columns 2-3. Then the next output row [2,2,3] could be the two 2s and a 3 in row 3. But then the third output [0,0,2] is confusing. Wait, maybe it's the number of consecutive non-1 elements in each column or row?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is capturing \"islands\" of non-1 values. For instance, in Example 0's input, there's a 2x2 block of 2s in rows 2-3, columns 2-3. Then a 3 in row 3, column 4. Then a 2 in row 4, column 4. So maybe the output lists each such island, but how?\n\nLooking at the output for Example 0, the output has three rows. The first two rows have three elements each. Maybe each output row corresponds to a different layer of numbers. Like, the highest number in the input is 3, so there are layers for 2 and 3. Wait, let's check. The input has 2s and a 3. The output for Example 0 has three rows. The first output line is [2,2,0]. The second is [2,2,3]. Third is [0,0,2]. Maybe each layer (like 2, then 3) is considered. For layer 2, the output entries could represent the count of contiguous blocks. Wait, but how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is grouping the non-1 elements by their value and their positions. Let's take Example 0's input:\n\nRow 2 has two 2s. Row 3 has two 2s and a 3. Row 4 has one 2. So the output's first line is [2,2,0]. Maybe this is indicating that there's a 2 with a count of 2, and then 0? Not sure. The second line [2,2,3] could be the two 2s and a 3. Then the third line [0,0,2] maybe refers to a 2 in the third position. Hmm, not clear.\n\nLooking at Example 1. The input is a 7x7 grid. The output has two rows: [3,0,2] and [3,0,2]. The input has 3s in rows 2-3, column 3, and 2s in column 5 of those rows. So maybe the output is grouping the non-1 elements. Each output line represents a group. For instance, the 3s are in column 3, two rows. Then the 2s are in column 5. The output lines have [3,0,2], maybe the 3 is the value, then some positions or counts. But the 0 complicates that.\n\nWait, maybe the output is formed by looking at each column and, for each column, taking the first non-1 element encountered when scanning from the top, and then counting how many times it appears consecutively. For example, in Example 0:\n\nLooking at column 2: the first non-1 is 2, appearing in rows 2-3 (count 2). Column 3: same as column 2. Column 4: first non-1 is 1 (so no), then in row 3 it's 3. Then row 4 has a 2. Wait, but how does that map to the output?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by looking at each row of the input and, for each row, capturing the non-1 elements in the order they appear, along with their counts. For example, in Example 0's input rows:\n\nRow 1 (input row 0) is all 1s, so no output. Row 2 (input row 1) has [1,2,2,1,1,1,1]. The non-1s are two 2s. So maybe the output row here is [2,2,0], where 2 is the value, 2 is the count, and 0 is... something else. Then row 3 (input row 2) has 2,2,3. So output [2,2,3]. Then row 4 has a single 2. Maybe [0,0,2] because it's a single 2 in position 3? Not sure.\n\nBut in Example 1's output, the two lines are [3,0,2] and [3,0,2]. The input has two rows (rows 1 and 2) with 3 in column 3 and 2 in column 5. So maybe each output line corresponds to each of those rows. The first non-1 in row 1 is 3 in column 3. Then 2 in column 5. So [3, ...], but how to get 0 and 2? The 3 is in column 3. The 2 is in column 5. But the output has 3,0,2. Maybe the positions: 3 (column 3), then 0 (since between 3 and 5, the distance is 2, but perhaps 0 is a placeholder?), and 2 as the value. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each output row corresponds to a contiguous horizontal segment of non-1 numbers in the input. For Example 0, the first row with non-1s is row 1 (index 0?), which has 2,2. So the output for that segment is [2,2,0]. Then row 2 has 2,2 followed by 3, so two segments: [2,2,0] and [3, something]. But the output in Example 0's first line is [2,2,0], the second is [2,2,3], perhaps combining the two 2s and the 3. Hmm.\n\nWait, looking at the output dimensions. In Example 0, the input is 5 rows. The output is 3 rows. Example 1's input is 7 rows, output is 2. Example 2's input is 7 rows, output is 3. So the output's row count doesn't directly match the input's. Maybe the output rows correspond to the number of non-1 clusters or layers.\n\nAnother approach: let's look at the test input and see if applying possible patterns gives an output that matches the examples.\n\nTest Input:\n\n[1,1,1,1,1,1]\n\n[1,1,1,1,1,1]\n\n[1,1,1,2,1,1]\n\n[1,1,2,3,1,1]\n\n[1,1,1,1,1,1]\n\n[1,1,1,1,1,1]\n\nSo the non-1 elements are in row 2 (index 2?), column 4 (value 2), and row 3, columns 3 and 4 (values 2 and 3). \n\nLooking at the outputs from the examples, perhaps the output is capturing each vertical or horizontal cluster. For example, in row 3 of the test input, there's a 2 followed by a 3. So maybe each output row is a list of the non-1 values in a vertical stack. Alternatively, maybe the output is grouping adjacent non-1 cells, both horizontally and vertically.\n\nIn Example 2, the input has 5,5 in rows 2 and 3, then 6,6 in row 4. The output is three rows: [5,5], [5,5], [6,6]. Each output row corresponds to a horizontal pair in the input. So perhaps each horizontal pair of the same number is captured as a separate output row. So for each row in the input, if there are consecutive non-1 numbers, they are output as a list. But in Example 2, the first two output rows are [5,5], which comes from rows 2 and 3. Wait, but rows 2 and 3 both have 5,5. So the output has two [5,5] entries. Then row 4 has 6,6, which becomes [6,6].\n\nSo maybe the output is capturing each occurrence of a horizontal pair (or more) of the same number. For Example 2, each 5,5 pair in rows 2 and 3 are separate entries, hence two [5,5] in the output. Then the 6,6 in row 4 is another entry.\n\nLooking back at Example 0: the input has in row 1 (second row) two 2s. Then row 2 has two 2s and a 3. Row 3 has one 2. So the output has three rows. The first two might be the two 2s in row 1 and row 2. Then the 3 and the 2 in row 3 and 4. But the output entries have three elements each, which complicates this.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is built by layers. For example, the highest number in the input is 3 (in Example 0). So the first layer is 2, then 3. For layer 2, you look at all the cells with 2 and group them into regions. Each region's top-left coordinate and size? But the output is numbers, not coordinates.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each output row corresponds to the non-1 numbers in a particular diagonal or vertical line.\n\nWait, let's take Example 0's input again. The output is:\n\n[2, 2, 0]\n\n[2, 2, 3]\n\n[0, 0, 2]\n\nThe first output row could be referring to the two 2s in row 1. The second output row could be the two 2s and the 3 in row 2. The third output row might be the single 2 in row 3 (index 3). But why the 0s? Maybe the third element is the next value in the sequence. For example, the first row's 2s are followed by 0 (no continuation), the second's 2s are followed by a 3, and the third's 2 is followed by nothing (0). But that doesn't explain the third output row being [0,0,2]. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is capturing the maximum value in each vertical column. For Example 0, the input columns:\n\nColumn 0: all 1s.\n\nColumn 1: 1,2,2,1,1. Max is 2.\n\nColumn 2: 1,2,2,1,1. Max is 2.\n\nColumn 3: 1,1,3,2,1. Max is 3.\n\nColumn 4: all 1s.\n\nColumns 5-6: 1s.\n\nBut the output isn't [2,2,3], so that's not matching.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is the list of non-1 numbers in each row, but in a certain way. For Example 0's input:\n\nRow 1: [1,2,2,1,1,1,1] \u2192 2,2.\n\nRow 2: [1,2,2,3,1,1,1] \u2192 2,2,3.\n\nRow 3: [1,1,1,2,1,1,1] \u2192 2.\n\nBut the output is three rows. The first two are [2,2,0] and [2,2,3], then [0,0,2]. Maybe each output row corresponds to a row in the input that has non-1 elements, and each element is the value followed by the count, then the next value. For example, in row 1 (input row 1), there are two 2s, so [2,2,0] (0 indicating end). In row 2, two 2s followed by a 3, so [2,2,3]. In row 3, a single 2, so [0,0,2] (maybe leading zeros before the value and count). But this seems inconsistent with how the zeros are placed.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is capturing the non-1 elements in each column, but grouped vertically. For Example 0, columns 1 and 2 have two 2s vertically (rows 1 and 2). Column 3 has a 3 in row 2 and a 2 in row 3. But the output doesn't seem to align with that.\n\nLet's think about the test input. The non-1 elements are:\n\nRow 2 (third row): column 3 has a 2.\n\nRow 3: columns 2 and 3 have 2 and 3.\n\nSo possible clusters: the 2 in row 2, column 3 is isolated. Then in row 3, the 2 and 3 are adjacent. So maybe each output row represents a cluster. The 2 in row2/col3 is one cluster. The 2 and 3 in row3/col2-3 is another. But how to represent them as per the examples.\n\nLooking at Example 1's output, which has two rows of [3,0,2]. The input has two rows (row 1 and 2) with 3 in column3 and 2 in column5. So maybe each output row corresponds to each of these rows. The 3 and 2 in row1 would be [3,0,2], and same for row2. But why 0?\n\nAlternatively, the output is capturing the non-1 numbers in each row, but grouped by their positions. For example, in Example 1's row1, the non-1s are 3 and 2. The output line is [3,0,2]. Maybe the 3 is the first non-1, then 0 indicates the next position (since 3 is at index 2, the next non-1 is at index 4 (column5). The distance between them is 4-2-1=1. But 0 is not 1. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, the numbers in the output represent the values of non-1 elements in the order they appear in the input, but grouped by their occurrence in each row. For example, in Example 0's input row1, two 2s \u2192 [2,2]. Then row2 has two 2s and a 3 \u2192 [2,2,3]. Row3 has a 2 \u2192 [2]. But the output is three rows. The first two are [2,2,0] and [2,2,3], third [0,0,2]. Maybe each output row corresponds to a row in the input, and if there are non-1 elements, they are listed, padded with zeros to a certain length. But why the third output row is [0,0,2]?\n\nAlternatively, the output could be the transpose of the non-1 elements. For instance, in Example 2, the output is three rows, each with two elements. The input has three rows (rows 2,3,4) with pairs of 5,5; 5,5; 6,6. The output is each of those pairs as rows. So the output is taking each horizontal pair of non-1 numbers and listing them as a row. So for the test input, the horizontal pairs are in row3: 2,3 (but they are not the same number). Wait, but in Example 2, the pairs are same numbers. So maybe the output lists consecutive same numbers in a row. For example, in row2 of Example 2's input, 5,5 is a pair. Similarly, row3 has 5,5. Row4 has 6,6. So output lists each of these as separate rows.\n\nIn the test input, the first non-1 is in row2, column4 (2). Then in row3, columns3 and4 are 2 and3. Since they are not the same, they don't form a pair. So the output would be:\n\nFor row2: [2] \u2192 but in the examples, outputs have rows with two or three elements. Hmm, not sure. But in Example 2, each output row has two elements (the pairs). The test input's row3 has 2 and 3, which are different. So perhaps they are not considered a pair. But maybe they are considered as separate entries. Alternatively, the output could list all consecutive non-1 elements, regardless of their values. So in row3 of the test input, 2 and 3 are consecutive, so output as [2,3]. Then the output would have rows like [2], [2,3]. But how does this fit with the examples.\n\nLooking at Example 0's output, the first line is [2,2,0], which corresponds to two 2s in a row. The 0 might be padding. Similarly, the second line [2,2,3] could be two 2s followed by a 3. So perhaps the output is listing all consecutive non-1 elements in each row, padded with zeros to a certain length. But why in Example 0's third output line it's [0,0,2] for a single 2. Maybe the length is determined by the maximum number of consecutive non-1 elements in any row. For Example 0, the maximum is 3 (row2 has three non-1s: 2,2,3). So each row is padded to three elements. The single 2 in row3 becomes [0,0,2]. The two 2s in row1 become [2,2,0]. The three elements in row2 are [2,2,3]. So the output is the list of consecutive non-1 sequences in each row, padded with zeros to the maximum length of 3. But in Example 1's output, the lines are [3,0,2], which would imply that the maximum consecutive non-1 in any row is 3. But in Example 1's input, each row with non-1s has two elements (3 and 2). So why the padding to three? The output lines are [3,0,2]. Maybe this approach isn't correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking each \"run\" of non-1 numbers in each row, then listing them in the output. For example:\n\nIn Example 0's input:\n\nRow1: 2,2 \u2192 output [2,2]\n\nRow2: 2,2,3 \u2192 [2,2,3]\n\nRow3: 2 \u2192 [2]\n\nBut the output is three rows. How to get the given output. Maybe each row's run is represented as a list, and if there are multiple runs per row, each run is a separate entry. But in Example 0's input rows, each row has only one run of non-1s. So the output would have three entries. But the output given is three rows, but each has three elements. So maybe the output is padded with zeros to a fixed length. The maximum run length across all rows in Example 0 is 3 (row2). So each run is padded to three elements. So row1's run (2,2) becomes [2,2,0]. row2's run (2,2,3) is already three. row3's run (2) becomes [0,0,2]. Then the output is these three padded arrays. That seems to fit Example 0's output.\n\nTesting this with Example 1:\n\nThe input has two rows (rows1 and2) with non-1 elements. Each of these rows has two non-1 runs: 3 and 2. So each run is a separate entry. But each row has two elements. However, the output for Example1 has two lines of [3,0,2]. So perhaps the runs are not per row but per occurrence. For Example1, each row has two separate runs: 3 and 2. So each run is a single element. But since they are not consecutive, they are separate runs. So for row1 of Example1's input: 3 is a run of 1, then 2 is a run of 1. So the output would have two entries per row. But Example1's output has two lines. If each run is represented as a list padded to three elements, then the runs of 3 and 2 would be [3,0,0] and [2,0,0], but the output is [3,0,2] and [3,0,2]. That doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each row's non-1 elements are considered a single run, even if they are not consecutive. For Example1's row1: 3 is at position2, then 2 at position4. So the run is [3,2]. But they are separated by 1s. So maybe this isn't the case. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is capturing the non-1 elements in a vertical manner. For Example0, columns1 and2 have 2s in two consecutive rows. So perhaps each vertical run is captured. But then the output would be different.\n\nAnother approach: look at the output rows. Example0's output has three rows. The first is [2,2,0], which sums to 4. The second is [2,2,3] (sum 7), and third [0,0,2] (sum 2). The input's non-1 elements are: 2,2,2,2,3,2. The sum is 2+2+2+2+3+2=13. The output sums are 4+7+2=13. So maybe the output rows sum to the values of the non-1 elements, grouped in some way. But how the grouping works. For Example0's output rows:\n\n2,2,0 \u2192 2+2 =4 (the two 2s from row1).\n\n2,2,3 \u2192 2+2+3=7 (the two 2s and 3 in row2).\n\n0,0,2 \u2192 2 (the single 2 in row3).\n\nTotal 4+7+2=13, which matches the sum of non-1 elements. Similarly, Example1's output has two rows, each [3,0,2], sum 5 each, total 10. The non-1 elements in Example1's input are two 3s and two 2s: sum 3+3+2+2=10. So this fits. Example2's output has three rows: [5,5], [5,5], [6,6]. Sums are 10,10,12. Total 32. The input's non-1 elements are two 5s in row2, two in row3, two 6s in row4. Total 5*4 +6*2=20+12=32. So the output sum equals the sum of non-1 elements. So the output seems to group the non-1 elements into clusters, and each cluster's sum is represented in the output row.\n\nSo the key pattern is that each output row corresponds to a cluster of contiguous (probably horizontally connected) non-1 elements in the input. Each output row lists the values of those elements, and the sum of the output row equals the sum of the cluster. If the cluster's elements are more than the output row's elements, perhaps they are summed as well. But how are the clusters determined?\n\nLooking at Example0's input:\n\nRow1: [1,2,2,1,...]. The two 2s are adjacent horizontally \u2192 cluster sum 4 \u2192 output [2,2,0]. Wait, sum is 4, but the output row's sum is 2+2+0=4. Then row2: two 2s and a 3 \u2192 sum 7 \u2192 output [2,2,3]. Sum 7. Then row3: a single 2 \u2192 sum 2 \u2192 output [0,0,2]. Sum 2. So each cluster is per row, and each horizontal group is a cluster. Even if they are in different rows but adjacent vertically, they are separate clusters.\n\nIn Example2's input, each horizontal pair is a cluster. So each row's 5,5 is a separate cluster. So each row's horizontal pair is its own cluster.\n\nIn Example1's input, the two rows (row1 and row2) each have a 3 and a 2 separated by 1s. So each 3 and 2 are separate clusters. But the output rows are [3,0,2], sum 5. Which would imply that each cluster is a vertical grouping. Because in Example1's input, the 3s are in column3, rows1 and 2, and the 2s are in column5, rows1 and 2. So each vertical pair is a cluster. The first output row [3,0,2] sum 5 (3+2=5). Wait, but 3+2 is 5. Maybe each cluster is a vertical pair. So the 3s in two rows are a cluster (3+3=6?), but the output is [3,0,2], sum 5. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe clusters are per cell. Each non-1 cell is its own cluster, but grouped in some way. But Example0's first cluster is two cells, which is represented as [2,2,0]. Sum 4. That would mean two cells of 2 each.\n\nBut then why the third element is 0. Unless the output is designed to have three elements per row, padding with zeros. But Example2's output has two elements per row. So this idea is inconsistent.\n\nWait, in Example2's output, each row has two elements. The input's non-1 elements are two 5s in row2, two in row3, two 6s in row4. Each of these is a horizontal pair. So the output lists each pair as a separate row, with their elements. So Example2's output is three rows: two [5,5] and one [6,6]. Their sum is 10,10,12, which matches the input sum. So the pattern here is that each horizontal contiguous group of non-1 elements is a cluster, and each such cluster is a row in the output. The row consists of the values in the cluster, padded with zeros if necessary.\n\nBut why in Example0's first output row it's [2,2,0]. The cluster is two 2s, so the output row should have two elements. But it has three. So perhaps the output rows are padded to the maximum cluster size in the input. In Example0, the largest cluster is three elements (two 2s and a 3 in row2), so all clusters are padded to three elements. Thus, the two 2s in row1 become [2,2,0], the three elements in row2 become [2,2,3], and the single 2 in row3 becomes [0,0,2].\n\nIn Example1's input, the clusters are the individual non-1 elements. For example, in row1, there's a 3 and a 2 separated by 1s. So each is a separate cluster. The output is [3,0,2] and [3,0,2]. Each cluster is a single element, but padded to three elements. So the sum would be 3+0+0=3 and 2+0+0=2, but the actual output sum per row is 5. Hmm, this doesn't align. Wait, the output rows in Example1 sum to 5 each. The input's non-1 elements are two 3s and two 2s. So sum is 3+3+2+2=10. The output has two rows, each summing to 5, which totals 10. So each row is summing to 5. How?\n\nIf each row in the output is a vertical pair of cells. For Example1's input, the 3s are in rows1 and 2, column3. So each 3 is in adjacent rows. Maybe they form a vertical cluster. Similarly, the 2s are in rows1 and 2, column5. So vertical clusters. Each cluster is two cells, sum 3+3=6 or 2+2=4. But the output rows sum to 5. Doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each output row represents a diagonal cluster. But how?\n\nAlternatively, the output rows are formed by combining horizontal and vertical adjacent cells. For example, in Example0's input, the two 2s in row1 and the two 2s in row2 are adjacent vertically, forming a 2x2 block. Then the 3 in row2 is a separate cluster. Then the 2 in row3 is another cluster. The 2x2 block would sum 2+2+2+2=8, but the output for Example0's first two rows sum 4 and 7. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, the clusters are formed by both horizontal and vertical adjacency. Let's see:\n\nIn Example0:\n\nRow1 has two 2s. Row2 has two 2s and a 3. The two 2s in row1 and row2's first two 2s form a 2x2 block. So this cluster sum is 2+2+2+2=8. The 3 and the 2 in row3 are separate clusters. But the output rows sum to 4,7,2. Doesn't align.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is not grouping clusters but simply taking each row's non-1 elements, padded to the maximum number of non-1 elements in any row. For Example0, the maximum non-1 elements per row is 3 (row2). So each row's non-1 elements are listed and padded with zeros to 3 elements. So row1: [2,2,0], row2: [2,2,3], row3: [2,0,0] \u2192 but the output given is [0,0,2]. So this doesn't fit.\n\nWait, maybe the order is reversed. For row3's single 2, perhaps it's padded at the end. So [0,0,2]. Then for row1, [2,2,0], and row2 [2,2,3]. The output rows are ordered based on the rows in the input. So the output has three rows corresponding to the three input rows with non-1 elements. Each output row is the non-1 elements of that input row, padded with zeros to three elements, with the elements ordered to the right. So the single 2 in row3 is placed at the end, resulting in [0,0,2].\n\nIn Example1's input, there are two rows with non-1 elements (rows1 and 2), each having two non-1 elements. The maximum per row is two. So each output row should have two elements, but the example's output has three elements. Hmm, this contradicts. Because Example1's output rows have three elements each. So this approach isn't valid.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output rows are formed by reading the non-1 elements in a spiral or some other order. But that's getting too complicated.\n\nLet's think about the test input now. The non-1 elements are:\n\nRow2: [1,1,1,2,1,1] \u2192 a single 2 in column3.\n\nRow3: [1,1,2,3,1,1] \u2192 2 in column2, 3 in column3.\n\nSo per this, there are three non-1 elements: 2 (row2,col3), 2 (row3,col2), and 3 (row3,col3).\n\nFollowing the previous pattern where each output row represents a cluster of horizontally contiguous non-1 elements, padded to the maximum cluster size. The clusters here would be:\n\n- The single 2 in row2: becomes [2,0] if maximum cluster size is 2.\n\n- The 2 and 3 in row3 are adjacent horizontally, so cluster [2,3]. \n\nBut the examples show that when two elements are adjacent, they form a cluster. So the test input would have two clusters: [2] and [2,3]. \n\nBut the output needs to be in the format of the examples. Looking at Example0's output, clusters are padded to three elements. The test input's maximum cluster size is 2 (the 2 and 3). So output rows would be padded to 2 elements. So:\n\nCluster1 (row2): [2,0]?\n\nCluster2 (row3): [2,3].\n\nBut in Example2's output, the clusters are two elements each. The test input's second cluster has two elements. So output would be two rows: [2] and [2,3]. But in Example0, single elements are padded with zeros to three elements. So perhaps the padding is to the maximum cluster size in the entire input. For the test input, max cluster size is 2, so padding to two elements.\n\nBut Example0's output has clusters padded to three elements, which is the max cluster size of three (the cluster in row2: three elements). So for the test input, the max cluster size is 2, so each cluster is padded to two elements.\n\nBut in Example2, the max cluster size is 2 (each cluster is two elements), so output rows are two elements each, no padding.\n\nIn the test input, the first cluster is size 1 (2), padded to two elements: [2,0]. The second cluster is size 2: [2,3]. But looking at the training examples, Example0's third cluster is size 1, padded to three elements as [0,0,2]. So padding with leading zeros. So for the test input's first cluster, [2], padded to two elements would be [0,2]. The second cluster [2,3] remains as is. Then the output would be:\n\n[0,2]\n\n[2,3]\n\nBut in the examples, the output rows for Example0 and Example2 are ordered based on the rows in which they appear. So the cluster from row2 comes first, then row3. So the test output would be:\n\n[0,2]\n\n[2,3]\n\nBut looking at the examples, Example0's output is three rows, each corresponding to the non-1 elements in rows 1,2,3. So the test input's output would have two rows: the first from row2's 2, padded to two elements, and the second from row3's 2,3. But the problem is how to determine the padding direction (leading or trailing zeros).\n\nIn Example0's first output row, the two 2s are followed by a 0, implying trailing zero. The single 2 in row3 is padded with leading zeros. But this inconsistency is confusing. Alternatively, maybe the padding is always trailing. For Example0's third cluster, a single 2 would be [2,0,0], but the output is [0,0,2]. So that's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, the clusters are ordered in the output based on their position in the grid, top to bottom, left to right, and each cluster's elements are listed in the order they appear. Then, each output row is padded with trailing zeros to the maximum cluster size. For Example0, clusters are:\n\nRow1: 2,2 \u2192 size 2.\n\nRow2: 2,2,3 \u2192 size3.\n\nRow3: 2 \u2192 size1.\n\nMax cluster size is3. So the output rows are:\n\n[2,2,0], [2,2,3], [2,0,0].\n\nBut the actual output for Example0 is [2,2,0], [2,2,3], [0,0,2]. So this doesn't fit. The third cluster's padding is leading zeros. So perhaps the padding is leading zeros for clusters smaller than max size. For example, the single 2 would be [0,0,2]. The two 2s would be [0,2,2] if leading zeros, but in Example0, it's [2,2,0]. So this is inconsistent.\n\nThis suggests that the padding might be on the right (trailing zeros) for clusters that are shorter than the maximum cluster size. However, the third row in Example0's output is [0,0,2], which implies leading zeros. This is conflicting.\n\nGiven the confusion, perhaps the pattern is different. Let's think again of Example2's output. The input has three clusters: two 5,5 in rows2 and3, and a 6,6 in row4. The output lists them as three rows: [5,5], [5,5], [6,6]. So each cluster is a horizontal pair, listed in the order they appear in the input. So each cluster is a horizontal contiguous group of non-1 elements, and each such group is output as a row in the same order they appear in the input.\n\nIn the test input, the first cluster is a single 2 in row2. The second cluster is 2 and 3 in row3. So according to this pattern, the output would be:\n\n[2]\n\n[2,3]\n\nBut looking at the training examples, when clusters are single elements, how are they handled? In Example0's third cluster, a single 2 is output as [0,0,2]. But in Example2, all clusters are pairs, so no single elements. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps any cluster, regardless of size, is padded to a certain length. For Example0, the maximum cluster size is 3, so clusters are padded to three elements. For Example2, the maximum is 2, so no padding. For the test input, the maximum cluster size is 2 (the 2,3 cluster). So the single 2 cluster is padded to two elements: [2,0]. So the output would be:\n\n[2,0]\n\n[2,3]\n\nBut in Example0's third cluster, the single 2 is padded with leading zeros to three elements: [0,0,2]. So perhaps the padding is leading zeros for single elements.\n\nBut then for the test input, the single 2 in row2 would be [0,2], padded to two elements. The 2,3 cluster would be [2,3]. So output:\n\n[0,2]\n\n[2,3]\n\nBut how does this align with the examples?\n\nExample1's output is [3,0,2] and [3,0,2]. Each output row has three elements. The input's non-1 elements are two 3s and two 2s. So each output row corresponds to a row in the input with non-1 elements. For example, row1 has 3 and 2. How to get [3,0,2]. If the maximum cluster size per row is two (3 and 2), but the output is padded to three elements. Maybe each row's non-1 elements are listed, padded with zeros to three elements. So for Example1's row1, the non-1 elements are 3 and 2 \u2192 [3,2,0], but the output is [3,0,2]. Not matching.\n\nAlternatively, the order is reversed. But Example0's first output row is [2,2,0], which matches the order of the elements in row1. So why in Example1's output it's [3,0,2]. Perhaps the non-1 elements are ordered from left to right, but with zeros inserted between if there are gaps. For Example1's row1, the non-1 elements are at positions2 (3) and4 (2). The output is [3,0,2], where 0 represents the gap between them. So each non-1 element is listed in order, with zeros for the positions in between. But that seems complicated. For example, if the row has non-1 elements at positions2,4,5, the output would be [x,0,y, z], but the examples don't support this.\n\nThis is getting quite confusing. Let's try to find another angle. Let's consider that each output row corresponds to a \"level\" of the non-1 elements. The highest number in the input is the number of levels. For Example0, highest is 3, so three levels. Each level's output row contains the counts of that number in certain positions. For example, level 2 in Example0 has clusters of 2s. But the output rows don't directly correspond to counts.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output rows represent the layers of numbers greater than 1, starting from the lowest to the highest. For Example0, the layers would be 2 and 3. But the output has three rows, which complicates this.\n\nAnother thought: looking at the test input, the non-1 elements are:\n\nRow2: 2 at column3.\n\nRow3: 2 at column2, 3 at column3.\n\nIf the output is supposed to list the non-1 elements in each row, with each row's elements padded with zeros to a fixed length. The maximum number of non-1 elements in any row of the test input is 2 (row3 has two). So each row's non-1 elements are listed and padded to two elements. Thus:\n\nRow2: [2,0]\n\nRow3: [2,3]\n\nSo the output would be:\n\n[2,0]\n\n[2,3]\n\nBut looking at the training examples, Example0's output rows are padded to three elements. So this approach may vary depending on the input's maximum non-1 elements per row.\n\nHowever, this doesn't align with Example1's output. Example1's input has two non-1 elements per row, but the output rows are three elements each. So this approach is invalid.\n\nAnother idea: each output row corresponds to a diagonal in the input. For example, the main diagonal's elements. But in Example0's input, the main diagonal would be 1,2,2,2,1. So not matching the output.\n\nAlternatively, the output is the result of some image processing-like operation, such as edge detection. For example, the output highlights changes between adjacent cells. But how to map that to the examples.\n\nAlternatively, the output represents the number of adjacent non-1 cells for each non-1 cell. But in Example0's row1, each 2 has two adjacent 2s (if they're in a horizontal pair). The sum for each cell could be the count of adjacent non-1 cells. But how that becomes the output rows.\n\nThis is taking too long. Let's try to hypothesize based on the test input and examples.\n\nIn Example0's output, each row of the output corresponds to a row in the input that has non-1 elements. For each such row, the non-1 elements are listed followed by zeros to make the length equal to the maximum number of non-1 elements in any row. The order is left to right. For example:\n\nExample0's input has:\n\nRow1: two 2s \u2192 max is 3, so [2,2,0].\n\nRow2: three non-1s \u2192 [2,2,3].\n\nRow3: one 2 \u2192 [0,0,2] (wait, why not [2,0,0]? Because in the output it's [0,0,2]. So perhaps the non-1 elements are aligned to the right, padded with leading zeros.\n\nIn Example0's row3, the 2 is in position4. So when padded to three elements, the 2 is at the end, so [0,0,2]. Similarly, row1's two 2s would be padded to three elements, with a trailing zero \u2192 [2,2,0]. Row2's three elements are already three \u2192 [2,2,3].\n\nFor Example1's input:\n\nEach row with non-1 elements has two elements (3 and 2). The max per row is two, but the output rows have three elements. So this approach doesn't fit. \n\nHmm.\n\nAnother possibility: the output is the transpose of the non-1 elements. For example, in Example0, the non-1 elements are:\n\nRow1: 2,2.\n\nRow2: 2,2,3.\n\nRow3: 2.\n\nIf we transpose these, we get columns of non-1 elements. But this doesn't seem to lead to the output given.\n\nAlternatively, the output is the result of some kernel operation. For example, applying a 3x3 kernel that sums the neighboring cells. But this seems complex.\n\nAlternatively, the output is the list of non-1 elements in the order they are visited in a spiral around the grid, starting from the top-left corner. But this would vary with grid size and is not clear from the examples.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and the lack of clarity, perhaps I should proceed with the following hypothesis based on the test input and training examples:\n\nThe output lists each horizontal group of consecutive non-1 elements in each row, with each group represented as a row in the output. The elements are listed as per their order in the input row, and padded with zeros to the maximum group size across all groups in the input. For example, in Example0:\n\n- Row1's group: [2,2] padded to max group size 3 \u2192 [2,2,0].\n\n- Row2's group: [2,2,3] \u2192 no padding.\n\n- Row3's group: [2] padded to 3 \u2192 [0,0,2].\n\nSo the output has three rows.\n\nFor Example1's input:\n\n- Each row (rows1 and2) has two separate groups: 3 and 2.\n\n- Each group is size 1, padded to max group size (which is 1). But the output rows are [3,0,2], which is three elements. So this doesn't fit.\n\nThus, this hypothesis is invalid.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is simply the non-1 elements listed by row, left to right, with each row's non-1 elements forming a row in the output, and padded with zeros to the maximum number of non-1 elements in any row.\n\nFor the test input:\n\n- Row2 has one non-1 element: 2.\n\n- Row3 has two: 2,3.\n\nThe maximum per row is 2. So row2's output row is [2,0], and row3's is [2,3]. So the output would be:\n\n[2,0]\n\n[2,3]\n\nBut looking at Example2's output, which has three rows each with two elements. The input's rows have two non-1 elements each. So the output is as expected. Example0's output has three elements per row, padded to the max of three.\n\nSo, for the test input, the output should be:\n\n[2,0]\n\n[2,3]\n\nBut let's compare with the examples. Example0's output has three rows. The input's rows with non-1 elements are rows1,2,3. Each of these rows' non-1 elements are padded to three elements. So the output for the test input would be:\n\nRow2: [2,0]\n\nRow3: [2,3]\n\nSo the output has two rows. However, looking at Example1's output, which has two rows (rows1 and2) with non-1 elements. The output has two rows. So this seems to fit.\n\nBut in Example1's output, each output row has three elements. But the max non-1 elements per row is two. So this approach doesn't fit.\n\nThis is very confusing. Given the time I've spent, perhaps I should go with the initial hypothesis that the output lists each horizontal group of non-1 elements, padded to the max group size with trailing zeros. For the test input, the groups are:\n\nRow2: [2] \u2192 max group size is 2 (from row3's group [2,3]). So padded to two: [2,0].\n\nRow3: [2,3].\n\nThus, output:\n\n[2,0]\n\n[2,3]\n\nBut in the training examples, Example0's output has groups padded to three elements. So this would require the test input's output to have two rows. However, looking back at the training examples:\n\nIn Example2, the output is three rows, each with two elements. So the max group size is two.\n\nIn Example0, three rows, three elements each. Max group size three.\n\nIn Example1, two rows, three elements each. So max group size three. But the non-1 elements in Example1's rows are two per row (3 and 2), which are separate groups of size 1. So the max group size would be 1. But the output rows have three elements. So this approach is inconsistent.\n\nThis is a tough one. Given that I need to provide an answer, I'll proceed with the following pattern:\n\nThe output is formed by listing each horizontal contiguous group of non-1 elements in the input, ordered by their occurrence (top to bottom, left to right). Each group is represented as a row in the output, with the elements of the group. If a group has fewer elements than the maximum group length in the entire input, it is padded with zeros to the right.\n\nFor example, in the test input:\n\n- Group1: [2] (row2, column3).\n\n- Group2: [2,3] (row3, columns2-3).\n\nMax group length is 2. So group1 is padded to [2,0], group2 remains [2,3]. So output:\n\n[2,0]\n\n[2,3]\n\nBut in Example0, the groups are:\n\nRow1: [2,2] \u2192 length 2.\n\nRow2: [2,2,3] \u2192 length3.\n\nRow3: [2] \u2192 length1.\n\nMax group length 3. So padded to 3 elements:\n\n[2,2,0]\n\n[2,2,3]\n\n[0,0,2]\n\nWhich matches Example0's output.\n\nFor Example1:\n\nGroups are row1: [3], [2]; row2: [3], [2]. Max group length 1. So padded to1, but the output has three elements. Doesn't fit. Hence, this approach is incorrect.\n\nBut since the test input's groups are [2] and [2,3], max length 2, the output would be:\n\n[2,0]\n\n[2,3]\n\nBut according to Example2's format, where each group is a row, this seems correct. However, the training example1's output is different.\n\nPerhaps the correct pattern is that each group is written as is, without padding. For example, in Example0, the output rows are [2,2], [2,2,3], [2]. But this doesn't match the given output. So perhaps this is not the case.\n\nGiven the confusion and time constraints, I'll proceed to provide the following answer for the test input based on the closest pattern I can discern:\n\nThe output lists each horizontal contiguous group of non-1 elements, with each group as a row. For groups smaller than the maximum group size, they are padded with trailing zeros. For the test input, the groups are [2] and [2,3], max size 2. So output:\n\n[2,0]\n\n[2,3]\n\nBut looking at the training examples, especially Example0's third row [0,0,2], it's possible that padding is done with leading zeros. So for the test input's [2], padded to 2 elements with leading zeros: [0,2]. Then the output would be:\n\n[0,2]\n\n[2,3]\n\nBut how to determine leading or trailing zeros.\n\nIn Example0's row1 group [2,2], padded to 3 elements \u2192 [2,2,0] (trailing zeros).\n\nRow3's group [2] \u2192 padded to 3 with leading zeros \u2192 [0,0,2].\n\nThis inconsistency makes it hard. But the test input's groups are [2] (size1) and [2,3] (size2). If padded to size2 with leading zeros, the first becomes [0,2], the second [2,3]. So output:\n\n[0,2]\n\n[2,3]\n\nWhich has two rows. This matches the structure of Example2's output, which has three rows for three groups.\n\nTherefore, the final answer for the test input would be:\n\n[0, 2]\n\n[2, 3]\n\nBut the training examples have outputs with three elements per row in some cases. For example, Example0's output has three elements per row. So for the test input, if the max group size is 2, then each row has two elements. So the answer should be formatted with each group as a row, padded to the max group size with trailing zeros. But since the test input's max group size is 2, and the groups are [2] and [2,3], padded to 2 elements:\n\n[2,0]\n\n[2,3]\n\nBut in Example0's case, the third group [2] is padded with leading zeros. So perhaps leading zeros are used. So the test input's first group [2] would be [0,2], and the second group [2,3] as is. So output:\n\n[0, 2]\n\n[2, 3]\n\nThis matches Example0's third group [0,0,2] where leading zeros are added.\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n[0, 2]\n\n[2, 3]\n\nBut looking at the training examples, especially Example1's output, which has [3,0,2], perhaps the padding is not just leading/trailing but based on the position in the row. For example, the non-1 elements are placed in their original positions within the padded row. For instance, in Example0's row3, the 2 is in the fourth column (index3 if 0-based). The output row is [0,0,2]. Maybe the output rows have elements placed according to their original column positions, truncated or padded as needed. But this seems complex.\n\nAlternatively, considering that in Example0's output, the third row is [0,0,2], which corresponds to a single 2 in the fourth column of a row. The output has three elements, which could represent the first three columns. But this is unclear.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and the need to provide an answer, I'll proceed with the hypothesis that each horizontal group is padded to the max group size with leading zeros. For the test input, this results in:\n\n[0,2]\n\n[2,3]\n\nFormatted as per the examples with each row in square brackets. So the final answer is:\n\n[0, 2]\n\n[2, 3]"
