        "cot_1": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. So, looking at the training examples, each input has some non-zero numbers, and the output seems to spread those numbers in a certain way. Let's start by analyzing Example 0.\n\nIn Example 0's input, there's a 2 in the second row, third column, and a 3 in the fourth row, second column. The output has those numbers spreading to the right and down. For the 2, the entire row from column 3 onwards becomes 2, and then the next rows below start filling from the end. Similarly, the 3 in row 4, column 2 spreads to the right in its row and then fills the next rows below. Wait, but the 3's output shows the row filled with 3s, and then the next two rows have 3s at the end. Hmm.\n\nLooking at Example 1, the input is a 6 in the center. The output spreads it to the right in the same row and down the last column. So the row becomes 6,6 and the next row's last element is 6.\n\nExample 2 has an 8 in row 2, column 2, and a 5 in row 5, column 4. The output for 8 fills the entire row to the right, and the following rows (rows 3 and 4) have 8s in the last column. Then for the 5, it fills the row to the right starting from column 4, and the row below has 5 in the last column.\n\nExample 3 has numbers 8,7,6. The 8 in row 2, column 3 spreads right in its row and then the row below's last column is 8. Then the 7 in row 4, column 2 spreads right, and the next rows' last column. Similarly for 6.\n\nSo the pattern seems to be: for each non-zero number in the input, we spread it to the right in its own row, starting from its position, filling all the way to the end of the row. Then, in the rows below, each subsequent row takes the same number and fills the last column. The number of rows below that get filled depends on how far down the original number is? Or maybe each non-zero number creates a \"staircase\" effect where the right part of their row is filled, and each subsequent row adds the number to the end.\n\nWait, let's check Example 0 again. The 2 is in row 2 (0-based?), wait maybe the rows are 0-based. Let me see:\n\nExample 0 input:\nRow 1 (assuming 0-based) has a 2 in column 2. Output row 1 has [0,0,2,2,2,2]. Then rows 2 and 3 (maybe) have 2 in the last column. Wait, the output for 2's row is filled to the right. Then the next rows after that (row 2) ends with 2, then row 3 (which is the 3's row) is filled. Wait, maybe each non-zero number fills its own row to the right, and then the next rows (all below it?) have their last column filled with that number, up to the next non-zero number's row?\n\nAlternatively, for each non-zero cell, in the output, the entire row starting from that cell's position to the end is filled with that number. Then, in every row below that, the last column is filled with the same number until another non-zero is encountered. So the spread stops when a new non-zero is found in a lower row.\n\nFor example, in Example 2, the 8 is in row 1 (0-based?), and the next non-zero is 5 in row 4. So the 8 fills its row from column 1 to end, then rows 2 and 3 (below 8's row) have the last column as 8. The 5 is in row 4, fills its row from column 3 to end, and the row 5 has last column as 5.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. For each non-zero cell in the input, starting from the top row to the bottom:\n\n   a. In the output, the cell's row is filled with the number from the starting column to the end.\n\n   b. For each subsequent row below (until the next non-zero cell's row), the last column of that row is filled with the same number.\n\nSo in Example 1, the 6 is in row 1. The output fills row 1 from column 1 to end (so 6,6), then row 2's last column becomes 6.\n\nIn Example 3, the 8 is in row 1 (assuming input is 7 rows?), then the next non-zero is 7 in row 3. So after filling row 1 (8's row) with 8s to the right, rows 2 and 3's last column would be 8, but since row 3 has a 7, maybe the 8's influence stops at row 2, and then 7 starts. Wait, in Example 3's output, after the 8's row (row 1), row 2 (the next row) has last column 8, then row 3 starts the 7's spread. So the 7's row (row 3) is filled to the right, and the rows below (rows 4 and 5) have last column 7, until the next non-zero (6) in row 5. Wait, the 6 is in row 5, so after the 7's row (row3), row4's last column is 7, then row5 is the 6's row, which fills to the right, and row6's last column is 6.\n\nSo the rule is: for each non-zero number, fill its own row from its column to the end. Then, for each subsequent row below it, set the last column to that number, until you reach a row that has another non-zero number. Then, that new number's row is processed similarly.\n\nSo the key points are:\n\n- Process rows top to bottom.\n\n- For each non-zero in a row, first fill its own row to the right.\n\n- Then, for all rows below, fill the last column until another non-zero is encountered.\n\nSo applying this to the Test Input.\n\nTest Input:\n\nRow 0: [0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow 1: all zeros.\n\nRow 2: [0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow 3: all zeros.\n\nRow4: [0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0]\n\nRows5 and 6: all zeros.\n\nProcessing non-zero numbers in order of their rows:\n\nFirst non-zero is 8 in row0, column3.\n\nIn output, row0: from column3 to end (positions 3 to 7) become 8. So row0 becomes [0,0,0,8,8,8,8,8].\n\nThen, all rows below (row1, row2, etc.) until the next non-zero (row2 has 7) have their last column set to 8. But wait, the next non-zero is in row2. So rows 1 and 2's last column would be 8, but row2 has its own non-zero. So row1's last column is 8. Then row2's processing: the 7 is in column2. So for row2, fill from column2 to end with 7. Then, rows3 and 4's last column would be 7 until the next non-zero in row4. But row4 has 2. So after row2's processing, rows3 and 4 (up to but not including row4) would have last column 7. Then row4's 2 is processed: fill row4 from column5 (since index is 5) to end with 2, then rows5 and 6's last column are 2.\n\nSo step by step:\n\nProcess 8 in row0, column3:\n\n- row0 becomes [0,0,0,8,8,8,8,8]\n\n- rows1, row2, row3, row4 (but wait, the next non-zero is in row2, which is higher than row0. Wait, row0 is the first row, then row1 is next. The next non-zero after row0 is row2 (7), so rows1 and row2-1 (but row2 is the next non-zero). So rows below row0 (rows1, row2, etc.) until the next non-zero (row2) would be up to row2-1, which is row1. So row1's last column (index7) becomes 8. Then in row2, we have the 7. So row2's processing: fill row2 from column2 to end with 7. Then, rows after row2 (rows3,4,5,6) until the next non-zero (row4's 2). So rows3,4 (but row4 is the next non-zero, so up to row3) have their last column set to 7. Then process row4's 2: fill row4 from column5 to end with 2, then rows5 and 6 have last column 2.\n\nPutting this together:\n\nRow0: [0,0,0,8,8,8,8,8]\n\nRow1: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8] (last column 8)\n\nRow2: [0,0,7,7,7,7,7,7] (filled from column2 to end)\n\nRow3: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7] (last column from 7's spread)\n\nRow4: [0,0,0,0,0,2,2,2] (filled from column5 to end)\n\nRow5: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2] (last column 2)\n\nRow6: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2] (last column 2)\n\nWait, but let's check:\n\nOriginal input:\n\nTest Input:\n\nRow0: 8 is at column3. So in output row0, columns3-7 become 8.\n\nRow1: all zeros, so after processing 8, row1's last column (7) becomes 8.\n\nRow2: has 7 at column2. So row2's columns2-7 become 7. Then, rows3 and 4 (until row4's non-zero). Wait, row4's 2 is in column5. So after processing row2's 7, the next non-zero is row4. So the rows between row2 and row4 (which are row3) have their last column set to 7. So row3's last column becomes 7.\n\nThen row4's 2: columns5-7 become 2. Then rows5 and 6 (after row4) have their last column set to 2.\n\nSo:\n\nRow0: [0,0,0,8,8,8,8,8]\n\nRow1: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8]\n\nRow2: [0,0,7,7,7,7,7,7]\n\nRow3: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7]\n\nRow4: [0,0,0,0,0,2,2,2]\n\nRow5: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2]\n\nRow6: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2]\n\nBut let's check the test input. Wait, the test input has 7 rows (indices 0-6). Let me confirm the rows:\n\nTest Input rows:\n\n0: [0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0]\n\n1: all zeros\n\n2: [0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0]\n\n3: all zeros\n\n4: [0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0]\n\n5: all zeros\n\n6: all zeros.\n\nSo after processing:\n\nRow0: filled from column3 (index3) to end with 8. So row0 becomes [0,0,0,8,8,8,8,8].\n\nRow1: all zeros, but last column becomes 8.\n\nRow2: original has 7 in column2. So row2's columns 2-7 become 7. So [0,0,7,7,7,7,7,7].\n\nThen rows3 and 4 (up to but not including row4's 2). So row3's last column is 7.\n\nRow4's 2 is in column5. So row4's columns5-7 become 2. So row4 becomes [0,0,0,0,0,2,2,2].\n\nThen rows5 and 6's last columns become 2.\n\nSo the output rows:\n\nRow0: [0,0,0,8,8,8,8,8]\n\nRow1: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8]\n\nRow2: [0,0,7,7,7,7,7,7]\n\nRow3: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7]\n\nRow4: [0,0,0,0,0,2,2,2]\n\nRow5: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2]\n\nRow6: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2]\n\nThat should be the correct output.",

        "cot_2": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. So, looking at the training examples, each input has some non-zero numbers, and the output seems to spread those numbers in some way. Let's start with Example 0. The input has a 2 in the second row, third column and a 3 in the fourth row, second column. The output for 2 is that the entire row after it is filled with 2s starting from the original position. Then, in the next rows below, the last column becomes 2. For the 3, similarly, the row where 3 is starts filled with 3s, and the rows below have the last column as 3.\n\nWait, but in Example 0's output, the row with 2 (second row) becomes [0,0,2,2,2,2]. Then the third row's last element is 2. Then the fourth row is all 3s starting from where the 3 was. And the rows below have their last elements as 3. So maybe each non-zero number is expanding to the right in its own row, filling all cells to the end. Then, in the subsequent rows, starting from the next row, the same number fills the last column of each row until the next non-zero number is encountered.\n\nLooking at Example 1: Input has a 6 in the middle. The output has that row as [0,6,6], and the next row's last element is 6. So that fits. So the pattern seems to be:\n\n1. For each non-zero cell in the input, in the output, the same row is filled with that number starting from its original position to the end of the row.\n2. Then, for each subsequent row below that, the last column of each row is filled with the same number until another non-zero number is encountered in the input. The new number then takes over from that row onward.\n\nSo, in Example 0, the 2 is in row 1 (0-based index?), then row 1 becomes all 2s from column 2 onwards. Then rows 2,3,4,5 have the last column as 2. But then the 3 in row 3 (maybe index 3) overwrites that. So when a new non-zero number is encountered, it starts its own spread. So for the 3 in row 3, the output row 3 is filled from column 1 onwards with 3, and the subsequent rows (4,5) have their last column as 3.\n\nIn Example 2, there's an 8 in row 1, column 1. So the output row 1 is filled with 8s from column 1 onwards. Then rows 2 and 3 have last column 8. Then row 4 has a 5 in column 3, so row 4 is filled from column 3 onwards with 5, and the rows below (row 5) have last column 5.\n\nSo the process is: for each non-zero number in the input, starting from top to bottom:\n\n- In the row where the number is, replace all cells from its position to the end with that number.\n- Then, for all subsequent rows (below this one), set their last column to this number until another non-zero number is found in a lower row. When a new number is found, repeat the process for that number.\n\nSo the numbers are processed in order from top to bottom. Each non-zero number in the input affects its own row by spreading to the right, and then affects all rows below by setting their last column to its value until another number is encountered.\n\nNow let's test this against the examples.\n\nIn Example 3, the input has 8 in row 1 (assuming 0-based index here?), then 7 in row 3, then 6 in row 5. The outputs show each of these numbers spreading to the right in their own row, and the subsequent rows' last columns being filled with the current number until a new one is found.\n\nFor example, after 8's row (row 1) is filled, the next rows (2 and 3) have their last column as 8. But row 3 has a 7, so in that row, the 7 starts spreading, and the last columns of rows 4 and 5 are 7 until row 5's 6 takes over.\n\nSo applying this to the test input.\n\nThe test input is:\n\nRow 0: [0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0]\nRow 1: all zeros\nRow 2: [0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0]\nRow 3: all zeros\nRow 4: [0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0]\nRows 5,6: all zeros.\n\nSo non-zero numbers are:\n\nRow 0, column 3: 8\n\nRow 2, column 2:7\n\nRow 4, column 5:2\n\nProcessing from top to bottom.\n\nFirst, handle the 8 in row 0. So in row 0, starting from column 3, replace all to the right with 8. So row 0 becomes [0,0,0,8,8,8,8,8]. Then, any row below row 0 (rows 1,2,3,4,5,6) should have their last column (column 7) set to 8 until a new number is encountered.\n\nBut then in row 2, there's a 7. So up to row 2, the rows 1 and 2 would have last column as 8? Wait, no. Let's think step by step.\n\nProcessing order:\n\nFirst, process row 0 (8). So:\n\n- Row 0: [0,0,0,8,8,8,8,8]\n\nThen, for all rows after row 0 (rows 1,2,3,4,5,6), their last column (index 7) becomes 8. However, when another non-zero number is encountered in a lower row, we process that next.\n\nNext, in row 2, there's a 7. So when processing row 2 (after row 0 and 1), the 7 is in column 2. So:\n\n- Row 2: [0,0,7,7,7,7,7,7] (since it fills from column 2 to the end). Then, the subsequent rows (3,4,5,6) would have their last column (7) set to 7, until another number is found.\n\nBut then, in row 4, there's a 2 in column 5. So when processing row 4, the 2 is found. So:\n\n- Row 4: [0,0,0,0,0,2,2,2] (since starting from column 5, fill to the end). Then, the subsequent rows (5,6) have last column as 2.\n\nPutting this all together:\n\nRow 0: starts with 8. So row 0 becomes [0,0,0,8,8,8,8,8]. Then all rows after row 0 (1,2,3,4,5,6) have their last column (index 7) as 8 until a new number is processed.\n\nBut then, row 2 has the 7. So when processing row 2, we first check if there's a non-zero. So before processing row 2, rows 1 and 2's last columns are 8. But then, processing row 2's 7:\n\n- Change row 2 to [0,0,7,7,7,7,7,7]. Then, starting from row 3 onwards, the last column becomes 7 instead of 8. So rows 3,4,5,6's last column is 7 until the next non-zero.\n\nThen, row 4 has a 2. So processing row 4's 2:\n\n- Row 4 becomes [0,0,0,0,0,2,2,2]. Then, rows 5 and 6's last column becomes 2.\n\nSo let's walk through each row step by step.\n\nOriginal Test Input:\n\nRow 0: [0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow 1: all zeros.\n\nRow 2: [0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow 3: all zeros.\n\nRow 4: [0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0]\n\nRows 5-6: all zeros.\n\nProcessing the 8 in row 0:\n\n- Row 0 becomes [0,0,0,8,8,8,8,8].\n\nNow, for rows 1-6, set last column (index 7) to 8.\n\nBut then, processing row 2's 7:\n\n- Row 2's original data has 7 at column 2. So after processing:\n\nRow 2 becomes [0,0,7,7,7,7,7,7]. Now, rows 3-6's last column should be 7.\n\nThen, processing row 4's 2:\n\nRow 4's original data has 2 at column 5. So row 4 becomes [0,0,0,0,0,2,2,2]. Then, rows 5-6's last column becomes 2.\n\nSo let's assemble the output step by step.\n\nRow 0:\n\nOriginal row 0 after processing 8: [0,0,0,8,8,8,8,8]\n\nRow 1: Since after row 0, all rows below have last column as 8. But row 1 is all zeros except last column is 8. So [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8]\n\nBut wait, in the training examples, like Example 0, after the 2 in row 1, the next rows (like row 2) have the last column as 2, but the rest of the row remains as original except filled with 2s in the row of the number. But in row 2 of example 0's input, which was all zeros, the output row 2 is [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2], but in the example given, the output row 2 is [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2] (if 0-based, but in example 0's output, the row after the 2's row is [0,0,0,0,0,2], but the original row was [0,0,0,0,0,0]. So for that row, only the last element is 2. So the rest of the elements are original (zeros) except the last one.\n\nSo the processing for rows below the non-zero is to set the last column to the current number, but leave the rest as original (unless another non-zero is processed).\n\nSo back to the test input:\n\nRow 1: all zeros, but last column becomes 8 (from row 0's processing). So [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8]\n\nRow 2: after processing, the entire row from column 2 onwards is 7. So [0,0,7,7,7,7,7,7]. Then, for rows below row 2 (rows 3,4,5,6), their last column is 7. However, when we process row 4, the 2 will change the last column for rows 5 and 6.\n\nRow 3: all zeros, but last column is 7. So [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7]\n\nRow 4: original is [0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0]. Processing the 2, the row becomes [0,0,0,0,0,2,2,2]. Then, rows 5 and 6's last column is 2.\n\nRow 5: all zeros, last column is 2. [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2]\n\nRow 6: same as row 5. [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2]\n\nPutting all together:\n\nRow 0: [0,0,0,8,8,8,8,8]\n\nRow 1: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8]\n\nRow 2: [0,0,7,7,7,7,7,7]\n\nRow 3: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7]\n\nRow 4: [0,0,0,0,0,2,2,2]\n\nRow 5: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2]\n\nRow 6: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2]\n\nBut wait, in the training examples, after a new number is processed, does the last column for previous numbers still affect lower rows? Let's check Example 2 again. In Example 2, after processing 8 in row 1, rows 2 and 3 have last column 8. Then in row 4, the 5 is processed. So row 4 is filled with 5 from column 3 onwards. Then row 5's last column is 5. So rows 2 and 3 are under the 8's influence, but row 4 and 5 are under the 5's. So the processing order matters. Each non-zero in the input is processed in order from top to bottom. Once a new non-zero is found, the last columns below it are set to that new number.\n\nSo in the test input:\n\nAfter processing row 0 (8), rows 1-6's last columns are 8. Then, processing row 2 (7) changes rows 3-6's last columns to 7. Then, processing row 4 (2) changes rows 5-6's last columns to 2.\n\nSo the final output rows are as follows:\n\nRow 0: [0,0,0,8,8,8,8,8]\n\nRow 1: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8]\n\nRow 2: [0,0,7,7,7,7,7,7]\n\nRow 3: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7]\n\nRow 4: [0,0,0,0,0,2,2,2]\n\nRow 5: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2]\n\nRow 6: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2]\n\nYes, that seems right. Let me check if this matches the pattern in the examples. For example, in Example 0, the rows after the 2's row have their last column as 2 until the 3's row. Then after 3's row, last column is 3. So the same logic applies here. Each non-zero number in the input affects the rows below it until another non-zero is encountered."
