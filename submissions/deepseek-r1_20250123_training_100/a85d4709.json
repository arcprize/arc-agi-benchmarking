        "cot_1": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. So, the input is a 3x3 grid with some numbers, mostly 0s and 5s. The output is another 3x3 grid with numbers like 2, 3, 4, all the same in each row. Hmm.\n\nLooking at Example 0:\n\nInput:\n[0, 0, 5]\n[0, 5, 0]\n[5, 0, 0]\n\nOutput:\n[3,3,3]\n[4,4,4]\n[2,2,2]\n\nSo each row's output is the same number. Maybe the position of the 5 in the row determines the output number. Let's check each row.\n\nIn the first input row, the 5 is in the third position (index 2). The output is 3. Second row has 5 in the second position (index 1), output 4. Third row has 5 in first position (index 0), output 2. Hmm, maybe the index plus 1? 0+1=1, but output is 2. Wait that's not matching. Or maybe the column index plus something. Wait, maybe the output is determined by the column where the 5 is in the input row, and then that column's position in some order.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is based on the original column of the 5 in the input, but rotated. Let's see. Let's arrange the input matrices as positions:\n\nExample 0 Input:\n\nRow 0: 5 is in column 2\nRow 1: 5 in column 1\nRow 2: 5 in column 0\n\nOutput rows are 3,4,2. Maybe looking at the original columns and mapping 0\u21922, 1\u21924, 2\u21923? Not sure. Wait, in the output of Example 0, each row's output corresponds to the column of the 5 in the input row. Let's see:\n\nRow 0: 5 in column 2 \u2192 output 3\nRow 1: 5 in column 1 \u2192 output 4\nRow 2: 5 in column 0 \u2192 output 2\n\nHmm. That doesn't directly match. Wait, maybe it's the number of steps from the original position to the new position in some rotated way. Or perhaps the output is the number of non-zero elements in each column of the input? Let's check Example 0's input columns:\n\nColumns:\nColumn 0: 0,0,5 \u2192 1 non-zero\nColumn 1: 0,5,0 \u2192 1 non-zero\nColumn 2:5,0,0 \u21921 non-zero\n\nBut the output rows are all 3,4,2. So that doesn't align. Hmm.\n\nAnother angle: maybe each output number corresponds to the sum of the positions (indices) of the 5s in a certain way. For example, in Example 0, each row's 5 is in columns 2,1,0. The outputs per row are 3,4,2. Let's see if there's a pattern here. 2\u21923, 1\u21924, 0\u21922. Not obvious.\n\nLooking at Example 1:\n\nInput:\nAll rows are [0,0,5]. So each row's 5 is in column 2.\n\nOutput is all 3s. So in Example 0, when the 5 was in column 2, the output row was 3. So in Example 1, all 5s in column 2, output 3 each. So that seems consistent. Then maybe column 2 maps to 3, column 1 maps to 4, column 0 maps to 2. Let's check.\n\nIn Example 0:\n\nRow 0: column 2 \u2192 3\nRow 1: column 1 \u21924\nRow 2: column 0 \u21922\n\nYes, that's matching.\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput rows:\n[5,0,0] \u2192 column 0 \u2192 output 2\n[0,5,0] \u2192 column 1 \u2192 output4\n[5,0,0] \u2192 column0 \u2192 output2\n\nOutput is [2,4,2]. Which matches the mapping.\n\nExample3:\n\nInput rows:\n[0,5,0] \u2192 column1 \u21924\n[0,0,5] \u2192 column2 \u21923\n[0,5,0] \u2192 column1 \u21924\n\nOutput rows: 4,3,4. Which fits.\n\nSo the pattern is: for each row in the input, find the column where the 5 is located. Then map that column to a specific number. The mapping seems to be column 0 \u2192 2, column1\u21924, column2\u21923. Then the output row is filled with that number three times.\n\nSo the key is to determine the column of the 5 in each input row, then replace it with 2,4,3 for columns 0,1,2 respectively.\n\nNow, the test input is:\n\n[0,0,5] \u2192 column2 \u21923\n[5,0,0] \u2192 column0 \u21922\n[0,5,0] \u2192 column1 \u21924\n\nSo the output rows should be [3,3,3], [2,2,2], [4,4,4], but arranged in the same order as the input rows. So the first row (column2\u21923) becomes [3,3,3], the second row (column0\u21922) becomes [2,2,2], third row (column1\u21924) becomes [4,4,4].\n\nSo putting it together, the output should be:\n\n[3,3,3]\n[2,2,2]\n[4,4,4]",

        "cot_2": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. So, looking at the training examples, the inputs are 3x3 grids with 0s and 5s. The outputs are also 3x3 grids, but with numbers like 2, 3, 4 all repeating in each row.\n\nFirst, let's look at Example 0. The input is:\n\n[0, 0, 5]\n[0, 5, 0]\n[5, 0, 0]\n\nAnd the output is all 3s in the first row, 4s in the second, and 2s in the third. Hmm. What's special about the positions of the 5s in the input?\n\nIn the first input row, the 5 is in the third column. The output for that row is all 3s. In the second row, the 5 is in the second column, output is 4s. Third row has 5 in the first column, output 2s. Maybe the position of the 5 in each row determines the number in the output row. Let's check other examples.\n\nExample 1's input has all rows as [0,0,5], so all outputs are 3s. That fits because in each row, the 5 is in column 3. So maybe each column position (1,2,3) corresponds to a number (2,4,3)? Wait, in Example 0, first row's 5 is column 3 \u2192 3, second row column 2 \u21924, third row column 1\u21922. So maybe the mapping is column index (starting from 1) to the numbers 3,4,2. Wait, columns 1,2,3 correspond to 2,4,3? Because in Example 0, the third column (which would be index 3) maps to 3, second column (index2) maps to4, first column (index1) maps to2. So yes, maybe the position of the 5 in each row determines the output number for that row. So column 1\u21922, column2\u21924, column3\u21923.\n\nLet's check Example2. Input rows are:\n\n[5,0,0] \u2192 column1 \u2192 output 2s, which matches.\n\n[0,5,0] \u2192 column2 \u2192 output4s.\n\n[5,0,0] \u2192 column1 \u2192 output2s. So the output rows are [2,2,2], [4,4,4], [2,2,2]. That fits.\n\nExample3:\n\nInput rows are [0,5,0] (column2 \u21924), [0,0,5] (column3\u21923), [0,5,0] (column2\u21924). Output rows are 4s, 3s, 4s. Which matches.\n\nSo the pattern seems to be that for each row in the input, look at which column the 5 is in (columns 1,2,3). Then map that to 2,4,3 respectively. Then each row in the output is filled with that number.\n\nSo for the test input:\n\n[0,0,5] \u2192 column3 \u21923 \u2192 output row [3,3,3]\n\n[5,0,0] \u2192 column1\u21922 \u2192 [2,2,2]\n\n[0,5,0] \u2192 column2\u21924 \u2192 [4,4,4]\n\nSo the output should be:\n\n[3,3,3]\n\n[2,2,2]\n\n[4,4,4]\n\nBut wait, let me check the order. The test input has three rows. First row 0,0,5 \u2192 column3 \u21923. Second row 5,0,0 \u2192 column1 \u21922. Third row 0,5,0 \u2192 column2\u21924. So output rows are 3,2,4. So arranging them in order, the output should be:\n\n[3,3,3]\n\n[2,2,2]\n\n[4,4,4]\n\nYes, that makes sense."
