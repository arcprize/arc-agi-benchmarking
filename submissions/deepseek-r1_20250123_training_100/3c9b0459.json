        "cot_1": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. So, we have these input matrices and their corresponding outputs. The goal is to find out how the inputs are transformed into the outputs. Let me look at each example one by one.\n\nStarting with Example 0:\n\nInput:\n[2, 2, 1]\n[2, 1, 2]\n[2, 8, 1]\n\nOutput:\n[1, 8, 2]\n[2, 1, 2]\n[1, 2, 2]\n\nHmm. Let me see the differences. The first row of the input is [2,2,1], and the output's first row is [1,8,2]. Wait, the second row of the input is [2,1,2], which in the output becomes the middle row. The third row of input is [2,8,1], which becomes the first row reversed? Or maybe not. Let's check the other examples.\n\nExample 1:\n\nInput:\n[9, 2, 4]\n[2, 4, 4]\n[2, 9, 2]\n\nOutput:\n[2, 9, 2]\n[4, 4, 2]\n[4, 2, 9]\n\nLooking here, the input's third row is [2,9,2], which becomes the first row of the output. The second row [2,4,4] becomes reversed as [4,4,2] in the output's second row. The first input row [9,2,4] becomes the third row of the output, reversed to [4,2,9]. So maybe the rows are reordered, and each row is reversed. Let's check the other examples.\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput:\n[8,8,8]\n[5,5,8]\n[8,5,5]\n\nOutput:\n[5,5,8]\n[8,5,5]\n[8,8,8]\n\nHere, the input's rows are [8,8,8], [5,5,8], [8,5,5]. The output's first row is [5,5,8] which is the second row of the input. The output's second row is [8,5,5], which is the third row of the input. The third output row is [8,8,8], the first input row. So it looks like the rows are rotated. The order of rows in the output is 2nd, 3rd, 1st. Then, each row is reversed? Wait, let's see. The input's second row is [5,5,8], which becomes the output's first row. Reversed, [8,5,5], but no, it's [5,5,8]. So maybe not reversed. Wait, the output's rows are [5,5,8], [8,5,5], [8,8,8]. The input's rows are:\n\nRow1: [8,8,8]\n\nRow2: [5,5,8]\n\nRow3: [8,5,5]\n\nSo the output's rows are row2, row3, row1. Then, looking at each of these rows: row2 stays the same, row3 stays the same, row1 stays the same. So maybe the transformation is reordering the rows in a certain way, perhaps based on some criteria, then maybe reversing each row.\n\nWait, let's check example 0 again. Input rows:\n\nRow0: [2,2,1]\n\nRow1: [2,1,2]\n\nRow2: [2,8,1]\n\nOutput rows:\n\nRow0: [1,8,2]\n\nRow1: [2,1,2]\n\nRow2: [1,2,2]\n\nSo the output rows are [1,8,2], [2,1,2], [1,2,2]. Comparing to input rows, the output's first row is [2,8,1] reversed (since input's row2 is [2,8,1], reversed gives [1,8,2]). Then the middle row in output is [2,1,2], which is the same as input's row1. The third output row is [1,2,2], which is input's row0 [2,2,1] reversed. So maybe the rows are reordered in reverse order and each is reversed. Wait, input's rows are 0,1,2. Output rows are 2 reversed, 1 as is, 0 reversed. Hmm, that doesn't fit a simple rotation. Let's see example 1 again.\n\nExample1 input rows:\n\n[9,2,4]\n\n[2,4,4]\n\n[2,9,2]\n\nOutput rows:\n\n[2,9,2]\n\n[4,4,2]\n\n[4,2,9]\n\nSo output's first row is input's third row (same as input's third row). Output's second row is input's second row reversed (since input's second row is [2,4,4], reversed is [4,4,2]). Output's third row is input's first row reversed ([9,2,4] reversed is [4,2,9]). So in this case, the rows are ordered as 3rd, 2nd reversed, 1st reversed. So the order is row3, row2 reversed, row1 reversed. Wait, but in example0, the output rows are row2 reversed, row1 as is, row0 reversed. So why in example0 the middle row is not reversed?\n\nWait in example0's input row1 is [2,1,2], which when reversed is [2,1,2], same as original. So perhaps the pattern is: reverse the order of the rows (i.e., original row0 becomes row2, row1 becomes row1, row2 becomes row0?), but not exactly. Let's see:\n\nIn example0:\n\nOriginal rows: row0, row1, row2.\n\nOutput rows: row2 reversed, row1 as is, row0 reversed.\n\nSo the order is row2, row1, row0, but each reversed except row1 if reversing it doesn't change it. But why?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rows are sorted in some way. For example, sorted by their elements, but how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that each row is reversed, and then the entire matrix is rotated. Let's see.\n\nWait, in example0, input is:\n\nRow0: [2,2,1]\n\nRow1: [2,1,2]\n\nRow2: [2,8,1]\n\nIf we reverse each row:\n\nRow0 reversed: [1,2,2]\n\nRow1 reversed: [2,1,2]\n\nRow2 reversed: [1,8,2]\n\nThen the output in example0 is:\n\n[1,8,2], [2,1,2], [1,2,2]\n\nWhich is the reversed rows arranged in the order of row2 reversed, row1 reversed, row0 reversed. Wait, original order is row0, row1, row2. Reversed rows are row0r, row1r, row2r. Output is row2r, row1r, row0r. So that would be reversing the order of the reversed rows. So the entire matrix is reversed top to bottom, after reversing each row.\n\nWait, let's check:\n\nTake the input matrix. Reverse each row (so each row is reversed), then reverse the order of the rows.\n\nFor example, example0 input:\n\nOriginal rows:\n\n[2,2,1] \u2192 reversed \u2192 [1,2,2]\n\n[2,1,2] \u2192 reversed \u2192 [2,1,2]\n\n[2,8,1] \u2192 reversed \u2192 [1,8,2]\n\nThen reverse the order of the rows:\n\nOriginal reversed rows:\n\nRow0r: [1,2,2]\n\nRow1r: [2,1,2]\n\nRow2r: [1,8,2]\n\nReversed order would be row2r, row1r, row0r \u2192 [1,8,2], [2,1,2], [1,2,2], which matches the output of example0.\n\nYes, that works. Let's check example1.\n\nExample1 input:\n\n[9,2,4] \u2192 reversed \u2192 [4,2,9]\n\n[2,4,4] \u2192 reversed \u2192 [4,4,2]\n\n[2,9,2] \u2192 reversed \u2192 [2,9,2]\n\nThen reverse the order of the rows:\n\nrow2r: [2,9,2]\n\nrow1r: [4,4,2]\n\nrow0r: [4,2,9]\n\nWhich becomes the output as:\n\n[2,9,2], [4,4,2], [4,2,9]. Which matches example1's output. So this seems to be the pattern: reverse each row, then reverse the order of the rows.\n\nLet me check example2.\n\nInput:\n\n[8,8,8] \u2192 reversed \u2192 [8,8,8]\n\n[5,5,8] \u2192 reversed \u2192 [8,5,5]\n\n[8,5,5] \u2192 reversed \u2192 [5,5,8]\n\nReverse the order of rows:\n\nrow2r: [5,5,8]\n\nrow1r: [8,5,5]\n\nrow0r: [8,8,8]\n\nWhich gives the output as:\n\n[5,5,8], [8,5,5], [8,8,8], matching example2's output.\n\nExample3:\n\nInput:\n\n[3,2,9] \u2192 reversed \u2192 [9,2,3]\n\n[9,9,9] \u2192 reversed \u2192 [9,9,9]\n\n[2,3,3] \u2192 reversed \u2192 [3,3,2]\n\nReverse the order of the rows:\n\nrow2r: [3,3,2]\n\nrow1r: [9,9,9]\n\nrow0r: [9,2,3]\n\nSo output should be:\n\n[3,3,2], [9,9,9], [9,2,3], which matches example3's output. Yes, this pattern holds.\n\nSo the transformation is two steps:\n\n1. Reverse each individual row (i.e., [a,b,c] becomes [c,b,a]).\n\n2. Reverse the order of the rows. So the first row becomes the last, etc.\n\nSo for the test input:\n\nTest Input:\n\n[6,4,4]\n\n[6,6,4]\n\n[4,6,7]\n\nLet's apply the transformation.\n\nFirst, reverse each row:\n\nRow0: [6,4,4] \u2192 reversed \u2192 [4,4,6]\n\nRow1: [6,6,4] \u2192 reversed \u2192 [4,6,6]\n\nRow2: [4,6,7] \u2192 reversed \u2192 [7,6,4]\n\nThen reverse the order of the rows. Original reversed rows are:\n\nRow0r: [4,4,6]\n\nRow1r: [4,6,6]\n\nRow2r: [7,6,4]\n\nReversed order of rows would be:\n\nRow2r, Row1r, Row0r \u2192 [7,6,4], [4,6,6], [4,4,6]\n\nSo the output matrix should be:\n\n[7,6,4]\n\n[4,6,6]\n\n[4,4,6]\n\nWait, let me check again.\n\nTest input rows:\n\nOriginal rows:\n\nRow0: [6,4,4] \u2192 reversed \u2192 [4,4,6]\n\nRow1: [6,6,4] \u2192 reversed \u2192 [4,6,6]\n\nRow2: [4,6,7] \u2192 reversed \u2192 [7,6,4]\n\nNow, reversing the order of the rows. Original order after reversing each row is:\n\nRow0r, Row1r, Row2r \u2192 [4,4,6], [4,6,6], [7,6,4]\n\nReversing the order would be Row2r, Row1r, Row0r \u2192 [7,6,4], [4,6,6], [4,4,6]\n\nSo the output should be:\n\n[7,6,4]\n\n[4,6,6]\n\n[4,4,6]\n\nBut looking back at the training examples, the outputs are formatted with each row in brackets. So the final answer should be:\n\n[7, 6, 4]\n\n[4, 6, 6]\n\n[4, 4, 6]\n\nYes, that's correct.",

        "cot_2": "Okay, let's tackle this puzzle. I need to figure out the pattern from the training examples to apply it to the test input. Let's start by looking at each example and see what transformations are happening.\n\nLooking at Example 0:\nInput:\n[2, 2, 1]\n[2, 1, 2]\n[2, 8, 1]\n\nOutput:\n[1, 8, 2]\n[2, 1, 2]\n[1, 2, 2]\n\nHmm, the first thing I notice is that the output rows might be reversed or rotated versions of the input rows. Let me check each row. The first input row is [2,2,1], and the output first row is [1,8,2]. Wait, that doesn't look like a simple reverse. Wait, maybe looking at the entire matrix. Let's see the original matrix:\n\nOriginal rows:\nRow 0: [2,2,1]\nRow 1: [2,1,2]\nRow 2: [2,8,1]\n\nOutput rows:\nRow 0: [1,8,2]\nRow 1: [2,1,2]\nRow 2: [1,2,2]\n\nWait, maybe the output is the columns of the input matrix reversed or rotated. Let's check. The input columns are:\n\nColumn 0: 2,2,2 \u2192 Output column 0 would be 1,2,1. But in the output rows, column 0 is 1,2,1. Hmm, the original column 0 is [2,2,2], but in the output, the first column is [1,2,1]. That doesn't match. Maybe another approach.\n\nLooking at the output rows, the middle row [2,1,2] is the same as the input's middle row. So the middle row stays the same. The other rows are being transformed somehow. Let's look at the first input row [2,2,1] becomes [1,8,2]. Wait, where does the 8 come from? The 8 is in the third row of the input. So maybe there's a swapping between rows.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each row is rotated or reversed. Let's check the first input row reversed: [1,2,2]. But the output's first row is [1,8,2]. The 8 isn't present in the first row. So perhaps not a simple reverse.\n\nLooking at the third input row [2,8,1], the output third row is [1,2,2]. Wait, perhaps elements are being swapped between rows. Let me think. The 8 in the input is in the middle of the third row. In the output, the 8 is in the middle of the first row. So maybe the 8 is moving from the third row to the first row.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the entire matrix is rotated 90 degrees. Let's see. If you rotate the input matrix 90 degrees clockwise, the first row would be the first column reversed. Let's try that. Original matrix:\n\nRow0: 2 2 1\n\nRow1: 2 1 2\n\nRow2: 2 8 1\n\nIf rotated 90 degrees clockwise, the first new row would be [2,2,2] (from column0 reversed?), but the output's first row is [1,8,2]. That doesn't fit. Maybe another rotation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rows are being reversed in some order. For example, original rows are 0,1,2. Output rows might be 2,1,0 but with some transformation. Let's see. The output rows are:\n\n[1,8,2] \u2192 which could be the third input row [2,8,1] reversed \u2192 [1,8,2]. Oh, yes! The third input row reversed is [1,8,2], which is the first output row. Then the second row remains the same. The third output row is [1,2,2], which is the first input row [2,2,1] reversed. So the pattern here is: reverse the order of the rows, and then reverse each row's elements. Wait, let me check.\n\nOriginal rows in order 0,1,2: [2,2,1], [2,1,2], [2,8,1].\n\nIf we reverse the rows' order to 2,1,0: [2,8,1], [2,1,2], [2,2,1], then reverse each individual row:\n\nRow 2 reversed: [1,8,2] \u2192 becomes first output row.\n\nRow 1 remains same when reversed? [2,1,2] reversed is [2,1,2] \u2192 so that's the same. So the second output row is the same as the original row 1.\n\nRow 0 reversed: [1,2,2] \u2192 which is the third output row.\n\nYes! So the transformation is: reverse the order of the rows and then reverse each row's elements. Let's check with the other examples.\n\nExample 1:\n\nInput:\n\n[9,2,4]\n\n[2,4,4]\n\n[2,9,2]\n\nOutput:\n\n[2,9,2]\n\n[4,4,2]\n\n[4,2,9]\n\nOriginal rows order 0,1,2. Reverse the rows to 2,1,0: [2,9,2], [2,4,4], [9,2,4]. Then reverse each row:\n\nRow 2: [2,9,2] \u2192 reversed \u2192 [2,9,2] \u2192 same as original. That's the first output row.\n\nRow 1: [2,4,4] reversed \u2192 [4,4,2] \u2192 second output row.\n\nRow 0: [9,2,4] reversed \u2192 [4,2,9] \u2192 third output row. Which matches the output. So that seems to fit.\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput:\n\n[8,8,8]\n\n[5,5,8]\n\n[8,5,5]\n\nOutput:\n\n[5,5,8]\n\n[8,5,5]\n\n[8,8,8]\n\nReversed rows order: 2,1,0 \u2192 [8,5,5], [5,5,8], [8,8,8]. Then reverse each row:\n\nRow2 reversed: [5,5,8] \u2192 first output row.\n\nRow1 reversed: [8,5,5] \u2192 second output row.\n\nRow0 reversed: [8,8,8] \u2192 third output row. Which matches the output.\n\nExample3:\n\nInput:\n\n[3,2,9]\n\n[9,9,9]\n\n[2,3,3]\n\nReverse rows order: 2,1,0 \u2192 [2,3,3], [9,9,9], [3,2,9]. Reverse each row:\n\nRow2 reversed: [3,3,2] \u2192 first output row.\n\nRow1 reversed: [9,9,9] \u2192 same as original, second output row.\n\nRow0 reversed: [9,2,3] \u2192 third output row. Which matches the output.\n\nSo the pattern is: reverse the order of the rows (so the last row becomes first, etc.), then reverse each individual row's elements.\n\nSo applying this to the test input:\n\nTest Input:\n\n[6,4,4]\n\n[6,6,4]\n\n[4,6,7]\n\nFirst, reverse the order of the rows. The original rows are row0: [6,4,4], row1: [6,6,4], row2: [4,6,7]. So reversed order is row2, row1, row0.\n\nSo new order:\n\n[4,6,7]\n\n[6,6,4]\n\n[6,4,4]\n\nThen reverse each individual row:\n\nFirst row (original row2): [4,6,7] reversed \u2192 [7,6,4]\n\nSecond row (original row1): [6,6,4] reversed \u2192 [4,6,6]\n\nThird row (original row0): [6,4,4] reversed \u2192 [4,4,6]\n\nSo the output should be:\n\n[7,6,4]\n\n[4,6,6]\n\n[4,4,6]\n\nWait, but let me check the format of the examples. Let me check example 0's output. The first output row is [1,8,2], which was original row2 reversed. So same process here.\n\nWait, the test input's reversed rows would be:\n\nOriginal rows:\n\nRow0: [6,4,4]\n\nRow1: [6,6,4]\n\nRow2: [4,6,7]\n\nReversed row order: row2, row1, row0 \u2192 [4,6,7], [6,6,4], [6,4,4]\n\nThen reverse each row:\n\nRow2: [4,6,7] \u2192 reversed \u2192 [7,6,4]\n\nRow1: [6,6,4] \u2192 reversed \u2192 [4,6,6]\n\nRow0: [6,4,4] \u2192 reversed \u2192 [4,4,6]\n\nSo the output would be:\n\n[7,6,4]\n\n[4,6,6]\n\n[4,4,6]\n\nBut let me check the output formatting. All the training examples have the same number of rows as the input. Each output row is a list. So the answer should be three rows as well. Yes. So the test output would be:\n\n[[7,6,4], [4,6,6], [4,4,6]]\n\nWait, but looking back at the examples, the output rows are arranged as:\n\nIn example0, the first output row is the reversed row2, then the second row is the same as original row1 (since reversing it gives the same), and third row is reversed row0.\n\nSo applying the same logic here, the test input's reversed rows are:\n\nrow2: [4,6,7], row1: [6,6,4], row0: [6,4,4]\n\nThen reverse each row:\n\nrow2 reversed \u2192 [7,6,4]\n\nrow1 reversed \u2192 [4,6,6]\n\nrow0 reversed \u2192 [4,4,6]\n\nSo the output is:\n\n[7,6,4]\n\n[4,6,6]\n\n[4,4,6]\n\nYes. That should be the correct answer."
