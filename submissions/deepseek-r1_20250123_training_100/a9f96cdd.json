        "cot_1": "Okay, let's tackle this puzzle. So, the task is to find the pattern in the training examples and apply it to the test input. Let me start by carefully looking at each example to figure out what's going on.\n\nStarting with Example 0. The input has a 2 in the middle of the second row. The output has numbers like 3, 6, 8, 7 in specific positions. Hmm, maybe the 2 is being transformed or moved, and those numbers are related to its position. Let me note the positions. The 2 is at (1,1) if we index rows starting at 0. The output has 3 at (0,0), 6 at (0,2), 8 at (2,0), and 7 at (2,2). Wait, those positions seem to be diagonally around the original 2. So maybe the 2 is split into four numbers placed around it diagonally?\n\nWait, but in Example 0, the output has [3,0,6,0,0] in the first row, then zeros in the second, and [8,0,7,0,0] in the third. The original 2 was in the second row. So perhaps the numbers are placed in the four corners around the 2's position. Let me check the positions. The original 2 is at (1,1). The outputs in the first row at (0,0) is 3, (0,2) is 6. In the third row, (2,0) is 8 and (2,2) is 7. Wait, that's four positions surrounding (1,1), like the four corners. But how do 3,6,8,7 relate to the original 2?\n\nLooking at Example 1. The input has a 2 at (2,4). The output has a 3 at (1,3). Wait, that's one position. Hmm, maybe in this case, the 3 is placed in a different pattern. Let me see. The original 2 is in the bottom row, fifth column. The output's 3 is in the middle row, fourth column. So maybe the 2's position determines where the new numbers are placed. But in Example 0, there were four numbers, here only one. So maybe the direction or the available space affects how many numbers are generated?\n\nWait, perhaps the position of the 2 in the input determines certain positions in the output. Let me see the positions of the 2 in each input and the corresponding outputs:\n\nExample 0: Input 2 at (1,1). Outputs at (0,0)=3, (0,2)=6, (2,0)=8, (2,2)=7.\n\nExample 1: Input 2 at (2,4). Output has a 3 at (1,3). Also, maybe other numbers? Let me check the output. The output is:\n[0,0,0,0,0]\n[0,0,0,3,0]\n[0,0,0,0,0]\nSo only a 3 here. So why the difference? Maybe when the 2 is at the edge, there's less space to place numbers. For example, in Example 1, the 2 is at the bottom row, last column. So maybe the possible positions to place numbers are limited. Let's see. If the original 2 is at (2,4), then the positions around it would be up-left, up-right, down-left, down-right. But since it's in the bottom row and last column, some of those positions would be out of bounds. For example, down-left and down-right would be beyond the rows. So maybe the valid positions are up-left and up-right. But in the output, there's only a 3 at (1,3). Wait, (1,3) is one row up from the 2's row (2) and one column to the left (from 4 to 3). So that's like up-left diagonal. Then why only one number here? Maybe each 2 in the input generates numbers in specific directions based on some rule.\n\nLooking at Example 2: Input has 2 at (0,2). Output has 8 and 7 in the middle row at positions (1,1) and (1,3). So, original position (0,2). The outputs are in the row below (row 1), columns 1 and 3. So maybe when the 2 is in the top row, the numbers are placed below, to the left and right? So the 8 and 7 here. So the pattern varies based on the original 2's position.\n\nExample 3: Input 2 is at (1,3). Output has 3 at (0,2), 6 at (0,4), 8 at (2,2), 7 at (2,4). So the original 2 is in the middle row, fourth column. The outputs are placed in the row above and row below, each two positions. For example, in row 0, columns 2 and 4 (3 and 6), and row 2, columns 2 and 4 (8 and7). So here, the 2 is in the middle, so there are four surrounding positions again.\n\nSo the pattern seems to be that when the 2 is placed in a position that allows for certain diagonals, the output numbers are placed in those diagonal positions, and each number corresponds to a specific direction. The numbers themselves (3,6,7,8) might be related to the direction. For example, in Example 0, the numbers 3,6,8,7 are placed in the four diagonals. Let's see their positions relative to the original 2's location (1,1):\n\n- (0,0) is up-left: 3\n- (0,2) is up-right:6\n- (2,0) is down-left:8\n- (2,2) is down-right:7\n\nSo perhaps each direction has a fixed number: up-left is 3, up-right is 6, down-left is8, down-right is7. But in Example 1, the 2 is at (2,4). Let's see possible diagonals:\n\nUp-left from (2,4) would be (1,3), which is where the 3 is placed. Up-right would be (1,5), which is out of bounds, so only 3 is placed. Similarly, down-left would be (3,3), which is invalid. So in this case, only the up-left direction is possible, leading to 3.\n\nIn Example 2, the 2 is at (0,2). Possible diagonals:\n\nDown-left from (0,2) is (1,1) \u2192 8?\nDown-right from (0,2) is (1,3) \u21927?\n\nBecause the 2 is in the top row, so the down directions are possible. So the output in Example 2 has 8 and 7 in those positions.\n\nIn Example3, the 2 is at (1,3). The four diagonals would be up-left (0,2), up-right (0,4), down-left (2,2), down-right (2,4). These positions get 3,6,8,7 respectively.\n\nSo the pattern seems to be:\n\nFor each occurrence of 2 in the input, in the output, place numbers in the diagonal directions (up-left, up-right, down-left, down-right) relative to the 2's position. Each direction has a specific value: up-left is 3, up-right is 6, down-left is8, down-right is7. However, if the diagonal position is out of bounds (like beyond the grid), then that number isn't placed.\n\nNow, let's test this hypothesis with the training examples.\n\nExample0: 2 at (1,1). All four diagonals are valid. So 3 (up-left), 6 (up-right), 8 (down-left),7 (down-right). Check the output:\n\nFirst row: 3 at (0,0),6 at (0,2). Third row:8 at (2,0),7 at (2,2). Yes.\n\nExample1: 2 at (2,4). Possible diagonals:\n\nUp-left: (1,3) \u21923. Up-right: (1,5) invalid. Down-left: (3,3) invalid. Down-right: (3,5) invalid. So only 3 is placed at (1,3), which matches the output.\n\nExample2: 2 at (0,2). Diagonals:\n\nUp-left: (-1,1) invalid. Up-right: (-1,3) invalid. Down-left: (1,1) \u21928. Down-right: (1,3) \u21927. So 8 and7 are placed. Which matches the output.\n\nExample3: 2 at (1,3). Diagonals:\n\nUp-left: (0,2) \u21923. Up-right: (0,4) \u21926. Down-left: (2,2) \u21928. Down-right: (2,4) \u21927. So all four positions are valid. The output has these numbers in those positions.\n\nSo the pattern is confirmed. Now, applying this to the test input.\n\nTest input:\n[0,0,0,0,0]\n[0,0,0,0,2]\n[0,0,0,0,0]\n\nSo the 2 is in the middle row (index1) and last column (index4). Let's find the diagonals:\n\nOriginal position (1,4).\n\nUp-left: (0,3). Valid (since row 0 and column3 are within 0-4).\nUp-right: (0,5) \u2192 column5 is invalid.\nDown-left: (2,3). Valid.\nDown-right: (2,5) invalid.\n\nSo the valid diagonals are up-left (0,3) and down-left (2,3). The values for up-left is 3 and down-left is8.\n\nWait, wait. Wait, the directions for down-left and down-right would be:\n\nFor a cell at (row, col), the four diagonals are:\n\nup-left: row-1, col-1\n\nup-right: row-1, col+1\n\ndown-left: row+1, col-1\n\ndown-right: row+1, col+1\n\nIn the test input's 2 is at (1,4). So:\n\nup-left: (0,3) \u2192 valid.\n\nup-right: (0,5) \u2192 invalid.\n\ndown-left: (2,3) \u2192 valid.\n\ndown-right: (2,5) \u2192 invalid.\n\nSo the numbers placed would be 3 at (0,3) (up-left) and8 at (2,3) (down-left). The down-left direction's value is8. So the output should have 3 in (0,3) and8 in (2,3).\n\nWait, but looking back at the previous examples. For example, in Example1, the 2 was at (2,4), and the output had 3 at (1,3) which is up-left. The down-left would be (3,3) which is invalid, so only 3. But in this test case, (1,4) has up-left (0,3) and down-left (2,3). So according to the pattern, 3 and8.\n\nWait, but wait: when the direction is down-left, the value is8, and up-left is3. So in the test case, the two valid diagonals are up-left (3) and down-left (8). So the output should have 3 at (0,3) and8 at (2,3).\n\nLooking at the training examples, when a position has multiple valid diagonals, their values are added. For example, in Example0, all four directions were valid, so all four numbers were placed. So here, the test input's 2 would result in 3 and8 placed in their respective positions.\n\nThus, the output would be:\n\nFirst row: [0,0,0,3,0]\n\nSecond row: [0,0,0,0,0]\n\nThird row: [0,0,0,8,0]\n\nBut wait, let's check the formatting. The examples use 5 elements per row. The test input's output would have 3 in row0, column3, and8 in row2, column3. So:\n\nRow0: [0,0,0,3,0]\n\nRow1: [0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow2: [0,0,0,8,0]\n\nBut looking at Example1's output, when there's only one number, it's placed in the correct position, and other positions are zeros. So that's correct.\n\nBut wait, let's check the other test cases. Wait, in Example3, the 2 was at (1,3) (row1, column3). The output placed 3 at (0,2), 6 at (0,4), 8 at (2,2),7 at (2,4). So each diagonal direction's value is placed in the corresponding cell. So for the test input, the 2 is at (1,4):\n\nup-left: row-1, col-1 \u2192 (0,3) \u21923.\n\ndown-left: row+1, col-1 \u2192 (2,3) \u21928.\n\nSo those two cells would have 3 and8.\n\nThus, the output would be:\n\n[0,0,0,3,0]\n\n[0,0,0,0,0]\n\n[0,0,0,8,0]\n\nBut wait, in Example1, the 2 was at (2,4), so up-left was (1,3), which got 3. And the output was:\n\n[0,0,0,0,0]\n\n[0,0,0,3,0]\n\n[0,0,0,0,0]\n\nSimilarly, the test case here would have 3 in (0,3) and8 in (2,3). So the output rows would be:\n\nFirst row: all zeros except 3 at position3.\n\nSecond row: all zeros.\n\nThird row: all zeros except8 at position3.\n\nSo the final output should be:\n\n[0, 0, 0, 3, 0]\n\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n[0, 0, 0, 8, 0]\n\nBut let me check if there's any other possible pattern. For example, in the training examples, sometimes other numbers like 6 or7 are present. So let's make sure that the test input's output only includes 3 and8.\n\nYes. Because the other diagonals (up-right and down-right) are out of bounds here. So only up-left (3) and down-left (8) are valid.",

        "cot_2": "Okay, let's try to figure out this pattern. So, the task is to look at the input grids and their corresponding outputs and find out the transformation rule. Then apply that rule to the test input.\n\nLooking at the training examples:\n\nStarting with Example 0:\nInput:\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[0, 2, 0, 0, 0]\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nOutput:\n[3, 0, 6, 0, 0]\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[8, 0, 7, 0, 0]\n\nHmm, the input has a 2 in the middle row, second column. The output has numbers 3,6,8,7 in positions around where the 2 was. Let me note their positions. The 3 is in row 0, column 0 (leftmost of top row), 6 is row 0, column 2 (third position). Then 8 is row 2, column 0, and 7 is row 2, column 2.\n\nWait, maybe the 2 is being split into these four numbers. But how?\n\nLooking at Example 1:\nInput:\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 2]\n\nOutput:\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[0, 0, 0, 3, 0]\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nHere the input 2 is at the bottom right. The output has a 3 in the middle row, fourth column. Wait, the positions might be shifted. Let's see. Original position is (row 2, column 4). The output's 3 is at (row 1, column 3). So maybe the numbers are placed in adjacent cells relative to the original 2's position. But how?\n\nExample 2:\nInput has 2 at (0,2). Output has 8 and 7 in row 1, columns 1 and 3. Wait, original position is top center. The output in example 2 is:\n[0,0,0,0,0]\n[0,8,0,7,0]\n[0,0,0,0,0]\n\nSo the 8 is at (1,1), 7 at (1,3). So maybe the 2 is being split into two numbers, but placed diagonally?\n\nWait, but the output has 8 and 7 here. Also in Example 0, the numbers were 3,6,8,7. So maybe each 2 is replaced by four numbers in specific positions relative to its original position. But how?\n\nExample 3:\nInput is a 2 in (1,3). The output has 3 and 6 in the top row, columns 2 and 4, and 8 and 7 in the bottom row, columns 2 and 4. So output is:\n[0,0,3,0,6]\n[0,0,0,0,0]\n[0,0,8,0,7]\n\nSo original position (1,3) (middle row, fourth column). The 3 and 6 are in the row above, columns 2 and 4 (which is one left and same column?), and 8 and 7 are in the row below, columns 2 and 4. Wait, that doesn't seem consistent. Maybe the numbers are placed in the four surrounding cells (up, down, left, right), but in these examples, maybe not. Let's check the positions.\n\nWait, perhaps the 2 is being transformed into four numbers placed in specific directions. For example, in Example 0, the 2 is at (1,1). The output numbers are at (0,0), (0,2), (2,0), (2,2). So those are diagonally two steps away? Like moving two cells up-left, up-right, down-left, down-right from the original position.\n\nWait, (1,1) to (0,0) is up-left by one step, but (0,0) is the top-left corner. Hmm, maybe. Let's check other examples.\n\nIn Example 3, the original 2 is at (1,3). The output has 3 and 6 at (0,2) and (0,4), and 8 and 7 at (2,2) and (2,4). So from (1,3), moving up-left by one (0,2), up-right (0,4), down-left (2,2), down-right (2,4). Each of these positions is one step diagonally from the original 2's position. Then those positions get values 3,6,8,7. But how do they get those numbers?\n\nLooking at the numbers: in Example 0, the output numbers are 3,6,8,7. Summing those gives 24. But 2 * 12 = 24? Not sure. Alternatively, maybe the numbers are arranged in a specific pattern. For instance, 3 and 6 are in the top row, 8 and 7 in the bottom. 3+6=9, 8+7=15. But that's 24 again. Hmm. Not sure.\n\nIn Example 1, the input 2 is at (2,4). The output 3 is at (1,3). So maybe only one position is filled here. But why? Wait, in Example 1's output, the 3 is at (1,3). The original 2 is at (2,4). So moving up-left by one step (from row 2 to 1, column 4 to 3). So only one cell is filled. Why? Maybe because some of the positions are out of bounds. For example, in Example 1, the original 2 is at (2,4), which is the bottom right corner. The four diagonal positions would be (1,3), (1,5) (invalid), (3,3) (invalid), (3,5) (invalid). So only (1,3) is valid. Hence, why in Example 1, only a 3 is placed there. But then why 3?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the numbers are determined based on the direction. For example, up-left gets 3, up-right 6, down-left 8, down-right 7. Let's check.\n\nIn Example 0: original at (1,1). Up-left is (0,0) \u2192 3. Up-right (0,2) \u21926. Down-left (2,0) \u21928. Down-right (2,2)\u21927. Yes, that matches the numbers.\n\nIn Example 3: original at (1,3). Up-left (0,2) \u21923. Up-right (0,4) \u21926. Down-left (2,2) \u21928. Down-right (2,4) \u21927. Which matches the output.\n\nIn Example 2, the original is at (0,2). Up-left would be (-1,1) invalid, up-right (-1,3) invalid. So only down-left and down-right. Down-left (1,1) and down-right (1,3). So the output has 8 and 7 there. So 8 is down-left (from (0,2) \u2192 (1,1)), and 7 is down-right (1,3). So the numbers 8 and 7 are placed there.\n\nSo the pattern seems to be:\n\nWhen there's a 2 in the input, in the output, four numbers (3,6,8,7) are placed in the four diagonal directions (up-left, up-right, down-left, down-right) relative to the 2's position, but only if those positions are within the grid. Each direction corresponds to a specific number: up-left=3, up-right=6, down-left=8, down-right=7.\n\nIf the diagonal position is outside the grid, then that number is skipped. For example, in Example 1, the original 2 is at (2,4). The up-left is (1,3) \u21923. The up-right would be (1,5) which is out of bounds. Down-left would be (3,3), which is out of bounds (since the grid has rows 0-2). Down-right would be (3,5) also invalid. So only the up-left is valid, hence the 3 placed there.\n\nSimilarly, in Example 2, original at (0,2). Up-left is (-1,1) invalid. Up-right (-1,3) invalid. Down-left (1,1) valid \u21928. Down-right (1,3) valid \u21927. So those two positions get 8 and7.\n\nNow applying this to the test input:\n\nTest Input:\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 2]\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nThe 2 is in the middle row, last column (position (1,4)). Let's find the four diagonal positions:\n\nUp-left: (0,3)\nUp-right: (0,5) \u2192 invalid (since columns are 0-4)\nDown-left: (2,3)\nDown-right: (2,5) \u2192 invalid\n\nSo up-left (0,3) gets 3, down-left (2,3) gets 8. The other two directions are out of bounds.\n\nSo the output should have 3 in row 0, column 3 and 8 in row 2, column 3. Let's check the training examples to see if this aligns.\n\nLooking at Example 1, which also had a 2 in (2,4) (the last row, last column). The output had a 3 in (1,3). Wait, in that case, the original 2 was in (2,4). The up-left from there is (1,3), which is where the 3 is placed. But according to the current test input, the 2 is in (1,4). So up-left would be (0,3). Down-left would be (2,3). So 3 and 8 would be placed there. So the output should have [0,0,0,3,0] in row 0, and [0,0,0,8,0] in row 2. But looking at the training examples, in Example 1, the 2 was at (2,4), and the output placed 3 in (1,3). So following the same logic, the test case's 2 is at (1,4). So up-left is (0,3) \u21923, down-left is (2,3) \u21928. So the output would have 3 and 8 in those positions.\n\nBut wait, in Example 3, the 2 was at (1,3), and the up-right was (0,4) \u21926. So in this case, for the test input's 2 at (1,4), the up-right would be (0,5) which is invalid. So no 6. But the up-left (0,3) is valid, and down-left (2,3) is valid. So those two positions get 3 and 8.\n\nBut wait, let's check the training examples again to see if this is consistent. For example, in Example 0, the 2 was in (1,1). The up-left (0,0) got 3, up-right (0,2) got 6, down-left (2,0) got 8, down-right (2,2) got7. So all four directions where possible. \n\nSo for the test input, the output would have 3 in (0,3) and 8 in (2,3). The other two directions are invalid.\n\nSo the output grid would be:\n\nRow 0: [0, 0, 0, 3, 0]\n\nRow 1: remains all zeros except where the 2 was, but the output replaces the 2's cell with zero.\n\nRow 2: [0, 0, 0, 8, 0]\n\nWait, but looking at the training examples, when the 2 is transformed, the original cell becomes zero. Like in Example 0, the input had 2 in (1,1), and the output has zero there. So yes, the original cell is cleared.\n\nSo the test input's output would be:\n\n[0, 0, 0, 3, 0]\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[0, 0, 0, 8, 0]\n\nBut looking at the examples, sometimes there's another number. For instance, in Example 3, the output also has 6 and 7. Wait, maybe I missed something here. Let me re-examine.\n\nWait, in the test input, the 2 is at (1,4). The up-left direction would be (0,3) \u21923. The down-left direction would be (2,3) \u21928. Are there any other valid directions?\n\nUp-right is (0,5), invalid. Down-right is (2,5), invalid. So only two positions: (0,3) and (2,3). But in Example 3, which had the 2 at (1,3), the output had 3 and 6 in the top row (0,2) and (0,4), and 8 and7 in the bottom row (2,2) and (2,4). So the four directions. So the test case should have 3 and 8, but also, wait, perhaps the up-right and down-right directions are possible. Wait no, in the test case, the 2 is at (1,4). The up-right direction would be (0,5), which is beyond column 4 (since columns are 0-4). So that's invalid. Similarly, down-right is (2,5), invalid. So only up-left and down-left are valid. So those positions get 3 and 8.\n\nBut looking at Example 1, where the 2 was at (2,4), the output had a 3 at (1,3). Which aligns with the up-left direction. So in the test case, the same logic applies. So the output should have 3 in (0,3) and 8 in (2,3).\n\nBut wait, in Example 3, when the 2 was at (1,3), the up-right was (0,4), which is valid. So the 6 was placed there, and down-right (2,4) got 7. So those were valid. So the test case's 2 is at (1,4). Let's see:\n\nUp-left: (0,3) \u21923\nUp-right: (0,5) \u2192 invalid\nDown-left: (2,3) \u21928\nDown-right: (2,5) \u2192 invalid\n\nSo only two numbers:3 and8. So the output rows would be:\n\nRow 0: [0,0,0,3,0]\nRow 1: [0,0,0,0,0]\nRow 2: [0,0,0,8,0]\n\nBut looking at the training examples, the outputs sometimes have other numbers. For example, in Example 0, the output had both 3,6,8,7. So maybe there's another part to the pattern. Hmm. Wait, but in the test case, are there other numbers? Let me check.\n\nWait, another angle: maybe the numbers are added to the existing numbers. But in the training examples, the inputs have zeros except for the 2. So when replaced, the output has the new numbers and zeros elsewhere. So perhaps the existing numbers (other than the 2) are retained. But in the examples, the outputs have zeros except for the new numbers. So the transformation replaces the 2 with zeros and adds the new numbers in the diagonal positions.\n\nSo, the test input's output should have 3 at (0,3) and 8 at (2,3), with everything else zero except those. So the output would be:\n\n[0,0,0,3,0]\n[0,0,0,0,0]\n[0,0,0,8,0]\n\nBut looking at the training examples, especially Example 1, the output for the 2 at (2,4) was a 3 at (1,3). So in that case, only one number was added. So our test case would add two numbers. But let's check the examples again.\n\nWait, in Example 3, the 2 was at (1,3). The output has 3 at (0,2), 6 at (0,4), 8 at (2,2), and7 at (2,4). All four directions were valid. So the four numbers are placed. In Example 0, same thing. So the pattern seems to be that each 2 is replaced with four numbers in the four diagonal directions, but only if those cells exist. If not, they are omitted.\n\nSo for the test case, the output should have 3 in (0,3) and 8 in (2,3). So the correct answer would be:\n\n[0, 0, 0, 3, 0]\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[0, 0, 0, 8, 0]\n\nBut let's check the answer format. The examples have the outputs as three rows with 5 elements each. The test input's output should follow the same structure. So the answer should be:\n\n[0, 0, 0, 3, 0]\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[0, 0, 0, 8, 0]\n\nBut wait, looking at Example 3, the output has 3 and6 in the same row (top row), and8 and7 in the bottom row. So the numbers can be in the same row. So our test case's output would have two numbers in different rows.\n\nYes. So this seems to fit."
