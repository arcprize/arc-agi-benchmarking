        "cot_1": "Okay, let's tackle this puzzle. So, the task is to figure out the pattern that transforms the 3x3 input matrices into 9x9 output matrices. Let me look at the training examples carefully to see what's going on.\n\nStarting with Example 0. The input is a 3x3 matrix:\n\n[1, 0, 0]\n[2, 1, 0]\n[0, 0, 1]\n\nThe output is a 9x9 matrix where the input matrix seems to be placed in the middle of the 9x9 grid. Wait, no. Let me check the positions. Looking at the output for Example 0, the input rows are inserted starting at row 3. The first three rows of the output are all zeros. Then rows 3,4,5 have the input rows, each followed by more zeros. Then rows 6,7,8 are zeros again. Wait, but the output is 9 rows. Let me count. Oh, right, the output is 9 rows each of 9 elements. So maybe the input matrix is scaled up by a factor of 3 in both dimensions. But how?\n\nWait, in Example 0's output, the input matrix is placed at the top-left corner of a 3x3 grid of 3x3 blocks. Wait, maybe each element of the input matrix is replaced by a 3x3 block. For instance, each element in the input becomes a 3x3 block in the output. But how are they arranged?\n\nWait, let's look at Example 0's output. The input is:\n\nRow 0: [1,0,0]\nRow 1: [2,1,0]\nRow 2: [0,0,1]\n\nThe output has 9 rows. The input rows appear in rows 3,4,5, but each row is followed by six zeros. Wait, for example, row 3 is [1,0,0, 0,0,0, 0,0,0]. Row 4 is [2,1,0, ... followed by zeros]. Then rows 0-2 are all zeros, rows 6-8 are zeros. So maybe the input is placed in the middle row of three vertical sections. Wait, the output is 9 rows. Maybe the 9 rows are divided into three groups of three rows each. Then the input is placed in one of these groups. For Example 0, the input is placed in the fourth row (index 3) and spans three rows. But then the rest are zeros. Hmm, perhaps it's a tiling pattern with some offset.\n\nLooking at Example 1's input:\n\n[0,1,2]\n[1,1,0]\n[2,0,0]\n\nThe output for Example 1 has the input rows in the bottom three rows (rows 6,7,8) but each row is preceded by six zeros. Wait, looking at the output:\n\nThe first three rows have some elements. For example, row 0 is [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,2]. So the last three elements of row 0 are the first row of the input. Similarly, row 1 ends with the second input row, and row 2 ends with the third input row. Then the middle three rows (3-5) are zeros. The bottom three rows (6-8) have the input rows at the beginning of each row. So rows 6,7,8 start with the input's rows followed by zeros. So maybe the input matrix is placed in different quadrants or positions depending on some pattern. \n\nWait, Example 0's output places the input in the middle three rows (3-5) at the start of each row. Example 1's output places the input in the top rows (0-2) at the end of each row and in the bottom rows (6-8) at the start. Example 2's output is more complex. Let me look at that.\n\nExample 2's input is:\n\n[2,1,2]\n[0,2,1]\n[2,1,0]\n\nThe output has non-zero elements in multiple places. For instance, the first three rows (0-2) have the input rows in the first three elements and the last three elements. The middle rows (3-5) have the input rows starting at position 3. The last three rows (6-8) have the input rows at the start. So it seems like the input is tiled in multiple positions. \n\nLooking at the structure, the output 9x9 matrix is divided into a 3x3 grid of 3x3 blocks. Each block corresponds to a position in the original input matrix. For example, the top-left 3x3 block in the output is determined by the (0,0) element of the input. Similarly, the top-middle block by (0,1), etc. Wait, maybe each element in the input matrix is expanded into a 3x3 block in the output. But how exactly?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each row of the input is replicated three times in the output but shifted in some way. For example, in Example 0, the input rows are placed in rows 3,4,5. In Example 1, they're in rows 6-8 and also at the end of rows 0-2. Hmm.\n\nWait, looking at Example 2's output:\n\nRow 0: [2,1,2, 0,0,0, 2,1,2]\n\nSo the first three elements are the first input row [2,1,2], then zeros, then again [2,1,2]. Similarly, row 0 has the first input row at the start and end. Row 3 has [0,0,0, 2,1,2, 0,0,0]. Wait, the middle block (positions 3-5) is [2,1,2], which is the first input row again. Then row 6 has [2,1,2, ... ] again. So maybe each input row is placed in three different positions in the output rows, each shifted by certain steps.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is constructed by tiling the input matrix in a 3x3 grid, where each cell of the original input is replicated in a certain way. But how?\n\nAnother angle: the output is three times larger in each dimension than the input. So each element in the input is transformed into a 3x3 block. The arrangement of these blocks could form a larger matrix. For example, the input matrix is arranged in a 3x3 grid where each element is placed in a specific 3x3 block of the output. But how are they arranged?\n\nLooking at Example 2's output. Let's break it into 3x3 blocks. The output is a 9x9 matrix, so each block is 3x3.\n\nThe first three rows (0-2) of the output have blocks:\n\nBlock (0,0): [2,1,2; 0,2,1; 2,1,0] which is the entire input matrix.\n\nBlock (0,1): [0,0,0; 0,0,0; 0,0,0] (all zeros).\n\nBlock (0,2): [2,1,2; 0,2,1; 2,1,0] again the input matrix.\n\nThen the next three rows (3-5):\n\nBlock (1,0): [0,0,0; 0,0,0; 0,0,0]\n\nBlock (1,1): [2,1,2; 0,2,1; 2,1,0] input matrix again.\n\nBlock (1,2): [0,0,0; 0,0,0; 0,0,0]\n\nRows 6-8:\n\nBlock (2,0): [2,1,2; 0,2,1; 2,1,0] input.\n\nBlocks (2,1) and (2,2) are zeros.\n\nWait, but this doesn't seem consistent. Let me check Example 2's output again.\n\nWait, Example 2's output is:\n\nRow 0: [2,1,2, 0,0,0, 2,1,2]\n\nRow 1: [0,2,1, 0,0,0, 0,2,1]\n\nRow 2: [2,1,0, 0,0,0, 2,1,0]\n\nRows 3-5:\n\nRow3: [0,0,0,2,1,2,0,0,0]\n\nRow4: [0,0,0,0,2,1,0,0,0]\n\nRow5: [0,0,0,2,1,0,0,0,0]\n\nRows6-8:\n\nRow6: [2,1,2,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow7: [0,2,1,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow8: [2,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nHmm, so the first three rows (0-2) have the input matrix split into the first three elements, then zeros, then the input again. Wait, row0: first three elements are the first input row [2,1,2], then three zeros, then [2,1,2] again. Similarly, row1 starts with the second input row [0,2,1], then zeros, then [0,2,1]. Row2 has the third input row [2,1,0], zeros, then the same row again. Then rows3-5: in row3, the input's first row is placed starting at position3. Row4: input's second row starts at position4. Row5: input's third row starts at position3 again? Wait, row5 is [0,0,0,2,1,0, ...]. So the input's third row is [2,1,0], here starting at position3 (indices 3,4,5). But position3 in row5 is 2, then 1, 0. So that's the third row of the input. \n\nThen rows6-8 have the input rows starting at position0, followed by zeros. So the input is placed in three different regions: the first three rows have it at the start and end, the middle three rows have it in the middle, and the last three rows have it at the start. But how does this relate to the input matrix?\n\nWait, maybe each element of the input matrix is being used to determine the placement of the entire input matrix in certain blocks. For example, if the input has a certain value in a position, that might dictate where the entire matrix is placed. But that seems a bit unclear.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is a 3x3 tiling of the input matrix, scaled up by 3, but with some shifts. For example, the input is placed in three different positions in the output. Like, the input is placed in the top-left, middle, and bottom-right? But looking at the examples, that's not exactly matching.\n\nAlternatively, the output is created by arranging the input matrix three times in different positions. For Example 2, the input is placed in the top-left, top-right, middle-center, and bottom-left positions. Wait, in the first three rows, they have the input at the start and end. Then in rows3-5, the input is in the middle. Then rows6-8 have it again at the start. So perhaps each row of the input is being shifted in a certain way in each of the three sections.\n\nWait, let's consider that each row in the input is being transformed into three different rows in the output. For instance, for each row in the input, create three rows in the output with different shifts. For example, in Example 0's input:\n\nRow0 of input is [1,0,0]. In the output, it appears as row3: [1,0,0 followed by zeros]. Then rows 0-2 and 6-8 are zeros. But in other examples, like Example1, input rows appear in different positions. So maybe the position in the output depends on the row index of the input. For Example0, the input rows are placed starting at row3. For Example1, input rows are in rows6-8 and also in the end of rows0-2. So maybe there's a pattern where each input row is placed in three different positions, shifted by certain amounts.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is constructed by arranging the input matrix three times vertically and three times horizontally, but with some spacing. For example, the input is placed three times in the output, each separated by three zeros. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is a 3x3 grid of the input matrix, where each grid cell is shifted in a certain way. Let's think in terms of a Kronecker product. The Kronecker product of the input matrix with a 3x3 identity matrix would result in a 9x9 matrix, but that doesn't seem to match the examples. For example, the Kronecker product would place each element of the input matrix multiplied by the identity matrix. But looking at the examples, the input rows are replicated in their entirety in certain positions.\n\nAnother approach: Let's see the output dimensions. The input is 3x3, output is 9x9. So each element in the input is somehow contributing to a 3x3 block in the output. Let's consider that each element in the input determines the value of a 3x3 block in the output. For example, the input's (i,j) element determines the block at position (i,j) in the 3x3 grid of blocks. But what's the rule for the block's content?\n\nLooking at Example0's output: The input is [1,0,0], [2,1,0], [0,0,1]. The output has non-zero rows starting at row3. Let's see the blocks. Maybe each block is a 3x3 matrix where the original element is placed in a specific position. For instance, if the input's (i,j) element is 'v', then in the output's block (i,j), the element at position (k,l) is 'v' if certain conditions are met. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps each row of the input is replicated three times in the output, but shifted by the row index. For example, in Example0, input row0 is placed in output row3, shifted by 0 columns. Input row1 in output row4, shifted by 0, and row2 in output row5. So each input row is placed in the output row (3 + input row index), and columns 0-2. Then the rest are zeros. But Example1's output shows that the input rows are placed in multiple positions. \n\nWait, in Example1's output, the input rows are present in the top-right (rows0-2, columns6-8) and bottom-left (rows6-8, columns0-2). So it's like the input matrix is placed in the top-right and bottom-left blocks of the 3x3 grid of 3x3 blocks. Also, the middle rows (3-5) are zeros. Similarly, Example2 has the input in multiple blocks. \n\nSo perhaps the pattern is that the output is a 3x3 grid of 3x3 blocks, and each block is either a copy of the input matrix or zeros, depending on some condition. But how?\n\nLooking at Example0: Only the middle block (rows3-5, columns0-2) contains the input. The rest are zeros. \n\nIn Example1: The top-right block (rows0-2, columns6-8) and bottom-left block (rows6-8, columns0-2) have the input. The rest are zeros.\n\nIn Example2: The output has the input in top-left (0-2, 0-2), top-right (0-2, 6-8), middle-center (3-5, 3-5), and bottom-left (6-8, 0-2) blocks. The other blocks are zeros. \n\nHmm, this seems more complex. What's the pattern here? Let's look for a rule that determines which blocks contain the input matrix.\n\nFor Example0, the input is placed only in the middle block (position (1,0) in the 3x3 block grid). Wait, but in Example0's output, the input is in rows3-5 and columns0-2, which would be block (1,0) if the blocks are arranged as:\n\nBlocks:\n[ (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) ]\n[ (1,0) (1,1) (1,2) ]\n[ (2,0) (2,1) (2,2) ]\n\nSo block (1,0) is rows3-5, columns0-2.\n\nBut why would the input be placed there? The input for Example0 is:\n\n1 0 0\n\n2 1 0\n\n0 0 1\n\nNot sure how that relates to the block position.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the blocks where the input is placed correspond to the positions of non-zero elements in the input matrix. For Example0, the input has a 1 at (0,0), 2 at (1,0), and 1 at (2,2). So maybe each non-zero element in the input matrix causes the entire input matrix to be placed in the corresponding block. For example, the element (0,0) in the input would place the input matrix in block (0,0) of the output. But in Example0's output, the input is placed in block (1,0), not (0,0). So that doesn't align.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each element's value determines the row shift. For instance, if an element is 'v', then the input is placed in the output starting at row (v*3). But Example0 has a 1 in (0,0), which would be row3. The input in Example0 starts at row3. That matches. Then in Example0's input, the first row has 1 in (0,0) which is value 1, so starts at row 1*3=3. The second row has 2 in (1,0), so 2*3=6, but in Example0's output, the input starts at row3. Hmm, not sure.\n\nWait, the first row of Example0's input is [1,0,0]. The highest value here is 1, which would correspond to starting at row3. The second row has 2 and 1. Highest is 2, which would be row6. Third row has 1. Highest is 1, row3. But in the output, the input is placed starting at row3. So maybe it's the minimum value or something else.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the sum of each row. For Example0's first row sum is1, second row sum is3 (2+1), third row sum is1. But not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the input is placed in the block corresponding to the position (i,j) where i and j are determined by the row and column indices of the input elements. This is getting complicated.\n\nLet's think differently. Let's look at how the input is placed in the output for each example.\n\nExample0: input is placed in rows3-5, columns0-2. So that's the block (1,0) in the 3x3 block grid.\n\nExample1: input is placed in blocks (0,2) and (2,0). Because rows0-2, columns6-8 (block (0,2)), and rows6-8, columns0-2 (block (2,0)).\n\nExample2: input is placed in blocks (0,0), (0,2), (1,1), and (2,0). Because rows0-2, columns0-2 (block 0,0); rows0-2, columns6-8 (block0,2); rows3-5, columns3-5 (block1,1); and rows6-8, columns0-2 (block2,0).\n\nSo what determines which blocks the input is placed in?\n\nLooking at the input matrices for each example:\n\nExample0's input has elements 1,2,0 in positions (0,0), (1,0), (2,2). \n\nExample1's input has elements 0,1,2 in row0; 1,1,0 in row1; 2,0,0 in row2. \n\nExample2's input is [2,1,2], [0,2,1], [2,1,0]. \n\nHmm, perhaps the positions in the output blocks correspond to the value of the elements in the input. For example, if an element is 'v', then the input matrix is placed in the block corresponding to (v, v) or something. But in Example0, the first element is 1. So maybe the input is placed in block (1, something). \n\nAlternatively, each time an element in the input is equal to a certain value, it triggers placing the entire input matrix in a specific block. For example, if there's a '1' in the input, place the input in block (1,0). But not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the number of times the input matrix is placed in the output depends on the sum of the elements. Example0's sum is 1+0+0 + 2+1+0 +0+0+1=5. Not sure.\n\nAnother approach: Let's look at the positions where the input is placed in the output for each example.\n\nExample0: middle-left block (block (1,0)).\n\nExample1: top-right (0,2) and bottom-left (2,0).\n\nExample2: top-left (0,0), top-right (0,2), middle-center (1,1), bottom-left (2,0).\n\nWhat's the relationship between the input values and these block positions? Let's see:\n\nIn Example0's input, the elements are 1,2,0 in the first column and a 1 in (2,2). Maybe the sum of each row determines the block row. For Example0:\n\nRow0 sum is 1 (0+0+1? Wait, the input is [1,0,0], sum is 1. So row0 sum is1. Row1 sum is 2+1+0=3. Row2 sum is0+0+1=1. Maybe the row sums modulo 3 are 1,0,1, which could correspond to rows 1,0,1 in the block grid. But how?\n\nAlternatively, for each row in the input, the sum modulo3 gives the row index of the block where that input row is placed. For Example0's row0 sum 1 mod3=1 \u2192 block row1. Then columns? Maybe column0. But in Example0's output, the entire input is placed in block (1,0). So perhaps each row of the input is placed in a block determined by the row's sum and column's sum. But this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the input's row index determines the block's row, and the input's column index determines the block's column. But Example0's input is placed in block (1,0), but the input's rows are 0,1,2. Not matching.\n\nThis is getting tricky. Let's think of the output as a 3x3 grid of 3x3 blocks, making a 9x9 matrix. Each block (i,j) in the output can be associated with a position in the input's matrix. For example, block (i,j) corresponds to input element (i,j). Then, if the input element at (i,j) is non-zero, the entire input matrix is placed in the block (i,j) of the output. But how does that work?\n\nWait, in Example0's input, the element (0,0) is 1. So block (0,0) in the output would contain the entire input matrix. But in Example0's output, the input is placed in block (1,0), not (0,0). So that's not it.\n\nAnother thought: maybe the input matrix is placed in the output matrix three times: once shifted down by 0 rows, once shifted down by 3 rows, and once shifted down by 6 rows, each time with the columns shifted as well. For Example0, the input is placed starting at row3, column0. So shifted down by 3 rows. The other shifts are zero. But why?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each row of the input is placed in a different position in the output. For example, row0 of the input is placed in rows0-2 of the output, row1 in rows3-5, and row2 in rows6-8. But in Example0, row0 of the input is placed in row3. So that's not matching.\n\nWait, let's look at Example1's input:\n\n[0,1,2]\n\n[1,1,0]\n\n[2,0,0]\n\nThe output has the input matrix in two blocks: top-right (rows0-2, columns6-8) and bottom-left (rows6-8, columns0-2). \n\nLooking at the input's elements: the first row has 0,1,2. The last element is2. Maybe the maximum value in a row determines the vertical position. For row0, max is2, so vertical position is 2 (rows6-8). But in Example1's output, the input appears in both top and bottom. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, for each element in the input, if it's 'k', then the input is placed in the k-th block row. For example, in Example0's (0,0) element is1, so block row1. Then the input is placed in block row1. But then column would need to be determined similarly.\n\nAlternatively, the value of the input's element determines both the row and column of the block. For example, each element 'v' in the input corresponds to a block at position (v, v) or something. But Example0 has a 2 in (1,0), which would map to block (2,0). But Example0's input is placed in block (1,0). Not sure.\n\nAnother approach: Let's see if the output is constructed by rotating the input matrix and placing it in different quadrants. For example, Example1's input is rotated or flipped in some way. Looking at Example1's output, the input appears in two blocks: top-right and bottom-left. That's diagonal, which might suggest a transpose or diagonal reflection. But when I look at the input and output, the rows are not transposed. In the top-right block of Example1's output, the input rows are [0,1,2], [1,1,0], [2,0,0] which is the same as the input. Similarly, the bottom-left block also has the same rows. So it's not a transpose.\n\nAlternatively, the output is a combination of the input matrix and its rotations. But Example0's output only has the input once, not rotated.\n\nThis is quite challenging. Let's try to find another pattern. \n\nLooking at the output matrices, the input is replicated in different positions. For example, in Example2's output, the input is placed four times: top-left, top-right, middle-center, and bottom-left. Each time, the input is the same. So the input is being placed in multiple blocks. \n\nWhat's the rule that determines which blocks the input is placed in? Let's look at the input matrix for Example2:\n\n[2,1,2]\n\n[0,2,1]\n\n[2,1,0]\n\nThe elements are 2,1,2 in row0; 0,2,1 in row1; 2,1,0 in row2. \n\nThe values in the input are 0,1,2. So perhaps the number of times the input is placed in the output depends on the values present in the input. For instance, each unique value in the input corresponds to a block where the input is placed. For Example2, which has values 0,1,2, the input is placed in four blocks. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, for each element in the input, if it's non-zero, then the input is placed in the block corresponding to that element's value. For example, if an element is 'v', then the input is placed in the block (v, something). But how?\n\nAlternatively, the sum of the elements in each row determines the vertical block position, and the sum of the columns determines the horizontal block position. For example:\n\nFor Example0's input:\n\nRow0 sum=1 \u2192 vertical block position 1.\n\nColumn0 sum=3 (1+2+0=3) \u2192 horizontal block position 0 (3 mod3=0). So block (1,0), which matches Example0's output.\n\nFor Example1's input:\n\nRow0 sum=3 (0+1+2=3) \u2192 vertical block position0 (3 mod3=0).\n\nColumn2 sum=2 (2+0+0=2) \u2192 horizontal block position2.\n\nSo block (0,2). But the output also has the input in block (2,0). How does that fit?\n\nRow2 sum=2 (2+0+0=2) \u2192 vertical block position2. Column0 sum=3 (0+1+2=3 mod3=0) \u2192 horizontal block0. So block (2,0). So Example1's input is placed in blocks (0,2) and (2,0), which matches the output.\n\nAh, this seems promising! Let's test this hypothesis.\n\nThe rule would be: For each row in the input, compute its sum modulo3 to get the vertical block index. For each column in the input, compute its sum modulo3 to get the horizontal block index. The input matrix is then placed in the output's block at (vertical, horizontal) position determined by the row and column sums.\n\nWait, but how does that work for each example?\n\nLet's take Example0:\n\nInput rows:\n\nRow0: 1+0+0=1 \u2192 sum mod3=1 \u2192 vertical block 1.\n\nRow1: 2+1+0=3 \u2192 mod3=0 \u2192 vertical block0.\n\nRow2:0+0+1=1 \u2192 mod3=1 \u2192 vertical block1.\n\nColumns:\n\nColumn0:1+2+0=3 \u2192 mod3=0 \u2192 horizontal block0.\n\nColumn1:0+1+0=1 \u2192 mod3=1 \u2192 horizontal block1.\n\nColumn2:0+0+1=1 \u2192 mod3=1 \u2192 horizontal block1.\n\nBut according to this, the input would be placed in blocks (1,0), (0,1), and (1,1). But in Example0's output, the input is only placed in block (1,0). So this hypothesis isn't correct.\n\nAlternative approach: Perhaps each element (i,j) in the input determines a block (v, h) where v is i and h is j. Then the input matrix is placed in each of these blocks. For example, if the element is non-zero, then place the input in block (i,j). For Example0, the non-zero elements are at (0,0), (1,0), (2,2). So the input would be placed in blocks (0,0), (1,0), and (2,2). But in Example0's output, the input is only in block (1,0). So this doesn't match.\n\nHmm, I'm stuck. Let's try to find another pattern.\n\nLooking at Example0's output, the input is placed in the middle-left block. The input's rows are placed in rows3-5, columns0-2. \n\nIn Example1's output, the input is placed in the top-right and bottom-left blocks. \n\nIn Example2's output, it's placed in top-left, top-right, middle-center, and bottom-left.\n\nNow, notice that in Example0, the sum of all elements in the input is 1+2+1=4 (since rows are 1,3,1). But I'm not sure how that helps.\n\nAnother observation: In Example0's input, the first column has elements [1,2,0]. Sum is3, mod3 is0. The second column [0,1,0] sum1. Third column [0,0,1] sum1. So maybe the columns determine the horizontal block. But how?\n\nAlternatively, the product of row and column sums mod3 gives the block position. Not sure.\n\nLet's think about the indices. For each example's input, the output blocks where the input appears are:\n\nExample0: block (1,0)\n\nExample1: blocks (0,2) and (2,0)\n\nExample2: blocks (0,0), (0,2), (1,1), (2,0)\n\nLooking for a pattern here. The blocks in Example2 are (0,0), (0,2), (1,1), (2,0). This looks like the diagonal blocks and the anti-diagonal. But not sure.\n\nWait, Example1's blocks are (0,2) and (2,0), which are the anti-diagonal. Example0's block is (1,0), which is middle-left. Example2's blocks include diagonal (0,0), (1,1), (2,0) (wait, no, (2,0) is not diagonal).\n\nAlternatively, the blocks are determined by some function of the input's indices. For example, block (i,j) where i is the row index and j is the column index. But that would mean for each input element, place the input in block (i,j). But in Example0, only (0,0), (1,0), (2,2) are non-zero. But the input is placed in block (1,0). So maybe only the element with value 2 (which is in (1,0)) determines the block. But why?\n\nAlternatively, the maximum value in the input determines the block. For Example0, max value is2, which is in row1, column0. So block (1,0). For Example1, max value is2, which is in row0, column2 and row2, column0. So blocks (0,2) and (2,0). For Example2, max value is2, which appears in (0,0), (0,2), (1,1), (2,0). So blocks (0,0), (0,2), (1,1), (2,0). This matches all examples!\n\nYes! This seems to fit. So the rule is: For each element in the input matrix that has the maximum value of the entire input, place the input matrix in the corresponding block of the output. Each block is a 3x3 region in the output. If there are multiple elements with the maximum value, the input is placed in all their corresponding blocks.\n\nLet's verify this with each example.\n\nExample0's input:\n\n[1,0,0]\n\n[2,1,0]\n\n[0,0,1]\n\nThe maximum value is 2, which is at position (1,0). So the input is placed in block (1,0), which is rows3-5, columns0-2. That's exactly what the output shows.\n\nExample1's input:\n\n[0,1,2]\n\n[1,1,0]\n\n[2,0,0]\n\nThe maximum value is2, occurring at positions (0,2) and (2,0). So the input is placed in blocks (0,2) (top-right) and (2,0) (bottom-left). Which matches the output.\n\nExample2's input:\n\n[2,1,2]\n\n[0,2,1]\n\n[2,1,0]\n\nThe maximum value is2, which appears at positions (0,0), (0,2), (1,1), and (2,0). So the input is placed in blocks (0,0), (0,2), (1,1), and (2,0). Looking at Example2's output, those blocks indeed contain the input matrix.\n\nYes! This pattern fits all training examples. \n\nNow, applying this to the test input.\n\nTest input:\n\n[1, 2, 2]\n\n[2, 0, 1]\n\n[1, 2, 0]\n\nFirst, find the maximum value in the input. The elements are:\n\nRow0: 1,2,2 \u2192 max is2.\n\nRow1:2,0,1 \u2192 max is2.\n\nRow2:1,2,0 \u2192 max is2.\n\nSo the maximum value is2. Now, find all positions where the element is2.\n\nPositions:\n\nRow0: (0,1), (0,2)\n\nRow1: (1,0)\n\nRow2: (2,1)\n\nSo the input matrix should be placed in the blocks corresponding to these positions:\n\n(0,1): top-middle block (rows0-2, columns3-5)\n\n(0,2): top-right block (rows0-2, columns6-8)\n\n(1,0): middle-left block (rows3-5, columns0-2)\n\n(2,1): bottom-middle block (rows6-8, columns3-5)\n\nEach of these blocks should contain the entire input matrix.\n\nNow, construct the output matrix. The output is a 9x9 matrix, divided into 3x3 blocks. All blocks are initially zeros. For each of the positions (0,1), (0,2), (1,0), (2,1), we copy the input matrix into those blocks.\n\nLet's build the output step by step.\n\nFirst, the input is:\n\nRow0: [1,2,2]\n\nRow1: [2,0,1]\n\nRow2: [1,2,0]\n\nBlock (0,1) is columns3-5. For rows0-2:\n\nRow0 of the output (index0) in columns3-5 will be [1,2,2].\n\nRow1 (output row1) columns3-5: [2,0,1].\n\nRow2 (output row2) columns3-5: [1,2,0].\n\nBlock (0,2) is columns6-8. So:\n\nRow0 columns6-8: [1,2,2].\n\nRow1 columns6-8: [2,0,1].\n\nRow2 columns6-8: [1,2,0].\n\nBlock (1,0) is rows3-5, columns0-2.\n\nRow3: [1,2,2] followed by zeros.\n\nRow4: [2,0,1] followed by zeros.\n\nRow5: [1,2,0] followed by zeros.\n\nBlock (2,1) is rows6-8, columns3-5.\n\nRow6: columns3-5: [1,2,2].\n\nRow7: columns3-5: [2,0,1].\n\nRow8: columns3-5: [1,2,0].\n\nThe rest of the positions in the output are zeros.\n\nSo combining all these, the output should look like:\n\nRow0: [0,0,0, 1,2,2, 1,2,2]\n\nRow1: [0,0,0, 2,0,1, 2,0,1]\n\nRow2: [0,0,0, 1,2,0, 1,2,0]\n\nRow3: [1,2,2, 0,0,0, 0,0,0]\n\nRow4: [2,0,1, 0,0,0, 0,0,0]\n\nRow5: [1,2,0, 0,0,0, 0,0,0]\n\nRow6: [0,0,0, 1,2,2, 0,0,0]\n\nRow7: [0,0,0, 2,0,1, 0,0,0]\n\nRow8: [0,0,0, 1,2,0, 0,0,0]\n\nLet me verify this against the training examples' pattern. Each block where the maximum value is present in the input has the input matrix placed in that block.\n\nYes, this matches the identified pattern. So the final answer should be this 9x9 matrix.",

        "cot_2": "Okay, let's tackle this puzzle. So, the task is to figure out the pattern that transforms the 3x3 input matrix into a 9x9 output matrix based on the given training examples. Let's start by looking closely at each example to see what's happening.\n\nLooking at Example 0:\nThe input is a 3x3 matrix:\n[1, 0, 0]\n[2, 1, 0]\n[0, 0, 1]\n\nThe output is a 9x9 matrix. Let me see how the original elements are placed. The first three rows of the output are all zeros. Then rows 3,4,5 (if 0-indexed, maybe rows 3,4,5 in 1-index?) have the original matrix in the first three columns, followed by zeros. Then the next three rows are zeros again. Wait, no, looking at Example 0's output:\n\nThe output's first three rows are all zeros. Then the fourth row is [1,0,0,...], fifth is [2,1,0,...], sixth is [0,0,1,...], then the next three are zeros. So the original matrix is placed starting at the fourth row, first column, and then the rest are zeros. Hmm. So maybe each element of the input is placed in a certain position in the output matrix, with some scaling or tiling?\n\nWait, but the output is 9x9. Let's think of 3x3 blocks. The original 3x3 matrix is placed in a specific block of the 9x9 grid. For example 0, the input is placed in the middle block vertically but starting at the left. Wait, maybe the output is a larger grid where the input is placed in different positions, perhaps scaled by a factor of 3? Because 3x3 to 9x9 is a 3x scaling in each dimension.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is constructed by tiling the input in some pattern. Let me check Example 1.\n\nIn Example 1, the input is:\n[0,1,2]\n[1,1,0]\n[2,0,0]\n\nThe output has the input matrix appearing in two places. The last three columns of the first three rows have the input. Then the first three columns of the last three rows also have the input. And the middle seems to have zeros. Wait, in the output, the first three rows end with the input's rows (e.g., first output row is [0,...,0,1,2], second [...,1,1,0], etc.), and the last three rows start with the input's rows (rows 6,7,8 start with [0,1,2], [1,1,0], [2,0,0]). Then the middle rows are zeros. So maybe the input is placed in both the top-right and bottom-left blocks of the 9x9 matrix? Because 9x9 can be divided into 3x3 blocks each of size 3x3. So the 9x9 grid is divided into a 3x3 grid of 3x3 blocks. Then the input is placed in specific blocks.\n\nLooking at Example 0's output: the input is placed in the middle block of the leftmost column. Because rows 3,4,5 (if counting from 0) have the input in columns 0-2. Then the rest are zeros. Wait, in example 0's output, the input is in the fourth, fifth, sixth rows (assuming 1-based, perhaps) but the first three columns. Then the rest is zeros. So maybe each element of the input is replicated in a certain way across the output's blocks.\n\nWait, let's think in terms of each input element being expanded into a 3x3 block. For instance, if the input is a 3x3 matrix, each element is replaced by a 3x3 block in the output. Then the output would be 9x9. But how the elements are arranged in their respective blocks?\n\nLooking at Example 0's input. The first row is [1,0,0]. In the output, the 4th row is [1,0,0 followed by zeros]. Then the 5th row is [2,1,0], etc. So maybe each element in the input is placed in a specific position within a 3x3 block. For example, the element at (i,j) in the input is placed at (3i + x, 3j + y) in the output, where x and y are offsets. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is built by shifting the input matrix into different quadrants. For instance, in Example 0, the input is placed in the middle left block, while in Example 1, it's placed in the top right and bottom left blocks. Then in Example 2, perhaps more positions are filled.\n\nLooking at Example 2's input and output:\n\nInput:\n[2,1,2]\n[0,2,1]\n[2,1,0]\n\nOutput:\nThe first three rows have the input in the first three columns and the last three columns. Then the fourth row has the input in columns 3-5 (middle block). Then the sixth row's fourth block (columns 3-5) has [2,1,0], etc. Also, rows 6-8 have the input in the first three columns again.\n\nSo this seems like the input matrix is tiled multiple times in the 9x9 output matrix. Maybe each element of the input is placed in three different positions in the output, each scaled by 3? For example, the element at (i,j) is placed at positions (i, j), (i+3, j+3), (i+6, j+6) but that might not fit.\n\nAlternatively, considering the output as 3x3 blocks arranged in a 3x3 grid. Each block is a 3x3 matrix. Then each block (m,n) in the 3x3 grid of blocks corresponds to a transformed version of the input matrix. For example, the block at position (0,0) in the output's 3x3 grid of blocks is the original input multiplied by some factor or shifted.\n\nWait, in Example 2's output:\n\nThe first three rows (block 0,0) of the output are [2,1,2,0,0,0,2,1,2]. That's the input's first row followed by zeros, then the input's first row again. Wait, no. Let me parse it:\n\nRow 0 of output is [2,1,2,0,0,0,2,1,2]. So the first three elements are the input's first row (2,1,2), then three zeros, then again (2,1,2). Similarly, row 1 is [0,2,1,0,0,0,0,2,1]. That's the input's second row (0,2,1), zeros, then (0,2,1). Row 2 is [2,1,0,0,0,0,2,1,0], which matches the third row of the input followed by zeros and then again the third row. Then the fourth row is [0,0,0,2,1,2,0,0,0], which is three zeros, then the input's first row, then three zeros. The fifth row is [0,0,0,0,2,1,0,0,0] (zeros, then second row of input, etc.). The sixth row is [0,0,0,2,1,0,0,0,0], which is zeros, third row of input, zeros. Then rows 7 and 8 have the input's rows again in the first three columns. \n\nThis seems like the input matrix is tiled in multiple positions of the 9x9 grid. Specifically, the input appears in the top-left, top-right, middle-center, and bottom-left blocks? Let me check:\n\nIn Example 2's output:\n\n- The first block (rows 0-2, columns 0-2) is the original input.\n- The first block of columns 6-8 (rows 0-2) is again the original input.\n- The middle block (rows 3-5, columns 3-5) is the original input.\n- The bottom-left block (rows 6-8, columns 0-2) is the original input.\n\nBut wait, looking at the fourth row (index 3) in the output: [0,0,0,2,1,2,0,0,0]. So columns 3-5 are 2,1,2 which is the first row of the input. Row 4 (index 4) has [0,0,0,0,2,1,0,0,0], which is the second row of the input. Row 5 (index5) has [0,0,0,2,1,0, ...], which is the third row of the input. So the middle block (rows 3-5, columns 3-5) is the input matrix. Then the bottom-left block (rows6-8, columns0-2) is the input again.\n\nSo in total, the input is placed in four different 3x3 blocks: top-left, top-right, middle-center, and bottom-left. Wait, but in the output of Example 2, the top-right block (columns6-8, rows0-2) also contains the input. Let me check:\n\nRow0 of output in Example2 is [2,1,2,0,0,0,2,1,2]. So columns6-8 are 2,1,2, which is the first row. Similarly, row1 columns6-8 are 0,2,1 (second row of input), and row2 columns6-8 are 2,1,0 (third row). So that's the input in the top-right block. Then rows3-5, columns3-5 are the input again. Rows6-8, columns0-2 are the input. So the input is placed in four positions: top-left (0-2,0-2), top-right (0-2,6-8), middle-center (3-5,3-5), and bottom-left (6-8,0-2). \n\nBut looking back at Example0, the input is placed only in the middle-left block. Wait, Example0's output has the input in rows3-5 (assuming 0-based) and columns0-2. That would be the middle-left block. So why in Example0 it's placed there, but in Example1 it's in top-right and bottom-left. So the pattern must vary based on the input.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each element of the input is being placed in certain positions based on their value. For example, when an element is 1, it's placed in a specific block, when it's 2, another block, etc. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is constructed by concatenating three rotated versions of the input matrix. For example, rotating the input by 0, 120, 240 degrees (but that might not make sense with numbers). Or maybe the output is a combination of the original matrix, a shifted version, etc.\n\nAnother approach: Let's look at the positions where the input elements appear in the output. For instance, in Example0, the input starts at row3, column0. In Example1, the input appears in the first three rows, columns6-8, and in rows6-8, columns0-2. So the positions vary. Maybe the input is placed in positions corresponding to the elements of the input matrix. For example, each element's value determines where the entire matrix is placed. But how?\n\nAlternatively, the input matrix is transformed into a 9x9 matrix where each row and column of the input is replicated three times. But that might not fit the examples.\n\nWait, in Example0, the input's first row is [1,0,0]. In the output, it's placed in row3 (assuming 0-based), columns0-2. Then the input's second row [2,1,0] is in row4, columns0-2, etc. So perhaps each row of the input is placed in the output starting at row (3 + i) mod 9, and column j. But not sure.\n\nAlternatively, considering that the output is a 3x3 grid of 3x3 blocks. Each block corresponds to a position in the input matrix. For example, the block at (i,j) in the output's 3x3 grid of blocks is filled with the value of the input's (i,j) element. But how? For instance, if input is 3x3, then each element is a 3x3 block in the output. So input[0][0] would be a 3x3 block in the output's (0,0) position. But in Example0, input[0][0] is 1. So perhaps the entire block is filled with 1s. But that's not the case. In Example0's output, the first 3 rows are all zeros, so that's not matching. Hmm.\n\nAnother thought: Maybe the output is a convolution of the input matrix with itself, but that's a stretch. Alternatively, it's a Kronecker product. The Kronecker product of a matrix with another matrix. For example, if the input is A, then the output is A \u2297 B, where B is some 3x3 matrix. But what would B be? Let's check Example0. The input is 3x3. If the Kronecker product is with a 3x3 matrix of 1s in the first row and 0s elsewhere, then each element of A is multiplied by that matrix. But in Example0, the output has the original matrix placed in rows3-5, columns0-2, which would correspond to the Kronecker product with a matrix that has 1 in the (1,0) position. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the output is the input matrix scaled up by a factor of 3, with each element placed in a specific cell of its 3x3 block. For instance, each element a in the input is placed in the center of its 3x3 block, and the rest are zeros. Then the output would have the input elements centered in their respective blocks. Let's see: If the input is 3x3, each element's position (i,j) in the input is mapped to the position (3i+1, 3j+1) in the output. The surrounding cells would be zero. But in Example0, the input is placed in rows3-5 (indices 3,4,5) and columns0-2. If each input element is in the center of a 3x3 block, then for the first input element (0,0) in the input, it would be at (1,1) in the output's first block, which would be row 1, column1. But in Example0, the first non-zero row is row3. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each element of the input is placed in a specific position within a 3x3 block based on its value. For example, if the value is 0, it's all zeros. If the value is 1, the block has a 1 in a certain position, and if 2, another position. But looking at Example0, the input's first element is 1, and in the output, it's in row3, column0. So maybe value 1 corresponds to the (3,0) position. But that's not consistent across examples.\n\nLet me try to look for another pattern. Let's consider the position of the input matrix in the output for each example.\n\nIn Example0, the input is placed starting at row3, column0. The output is 9 rows. So rows 3,4,5 (0-based) are the input rows. Columns0-2.\n\nIn Example1, the input is placed in two places: top-right (rows0-2, columns6-8) and bottom-left (rows6-8, columns0-2).\n\nIn Example2, the input is placed in four positions: top-left (0-2,0-2), top-right (0-2,6-8), middle-center (3-5,3-5), and bottom-left (6-8,0-2).\n\nHmm. So the positions where the input is placed vary. How do these positions relate to the input values? Let's look at the input values of each example.\n\nExample0's input has elements 1,0,0; 2,1,0; 0,0,1. The sum of each row? First row sum 1, second sum 3, third sum 1. But not sure.\n\nExample1's input is [0,1,2], sum 3; [1,1,0], sum 2; [2,0,0], sum 2. The output has the input in two positions.\n\nExample2's input has sums 5,3,3. The output has four placements.\n\nWait, maybe the number of times the input is placed in the output depends on the sum or certain characteristics of the input. For example, higher sums lead to more placements. Example0 sum is 1+3+1=5 (total?), Example1 sum is 3+2+2=7, Example2 sum is 5+3+3=11. But I don't see a direct correlation.\n\nAlternatively, the positions where the input is placed in the output correspond to the positions of non-zero elements in the input. For example, if the input has a non-zero element at (i,j), then the input matrix is placed in a certain block of the output. Let's check Example0: the input has non-zero elements at (0,0), (1,0), (1,1), (2,2). How many blocks are there in the output? In Example0's output, the input is placed once. So perhaps each non-zero element contributes to a placement. But Example0 has 4 non-zero elements but only one placement. That doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the input is shifted in the output according to some rule. For Example0, the input is shifted down by 3 rows. For Example1, it's shifted right by 6 columns and then down by 6 rows. Not sure.\n\nAnother approach: Let's consider the indices of the output where the input elements appear. Let's look for each example.\n\nExample0:\nInput row 0 [1,0,0] appears in output row3, columns0-2.\nInput row1 [2,1,0] appears in row4, columns0-2.\nInput row2 [0,0,1] appears in row5, columns0-2.\nSo each input row is offset by +3 rows. The columns are same.\n\nExample1:\nInput rows appear in two places:\n- In the first three rows, columns6-8. So row0 of input is output row0, columns6-8.\n- In the last three rows, columns0-2. So input row0 is output row6, columns0-2.\n\nSo the input is placed in the top-right and bottom-left blocks.\n\nExample2:\nInput appears in four blocks:\n- top-left (rows0-2, cols0-2)\n- top-right (rows0-2, cols6-8)\n- middle-center (rows3-5, cols3-5)\n- bottom-left (rows6-8, cols0-2)\n\nSo the input is placed in four different blocks.\n\nThe question is: what determines where the input is placed in the output?\n\nLooking at the input values:\n\nIn Example0, the input matrix has elements 1,2,1. Maybe the maximum value is 2, but how does that relate to the placement in the middle-left.\n\nIn Example1, input has elements up to 2. Output has input in top-right and bottom-left.\n\nIn Example2, the input has elements up to 2. Output has four placements.\n\nWait, maybe the number of times the input is placed depends on the maximum value in the input. For example, if the maximum is 1, it's placed once; if 2, placed twice, etc. But Example0's maximum is 2 and it's placed once, Example1's max is 2 and placed twice, Example2's max is 2 and placed four times. Hmm, that doesn't align.\n\nAlternatively, the placement could be based on the sum modulo 3 or something. Or perhaps the input matrix is rotated or mirrored in some way.\n\nWait, let's look at Example1's input and output. The input is:\n\n[0,1,2]\n[1,1,0]\n[2,0,0]\n\nIn the output, the input is in the top-right and bottom-left blocks. If you imagine the 9x9 grid divided into 3x3 blocks, top-right is (0,2) and bottom-left is (2,0) in the 3x3 grid of blocks. The sum of their coordinates (0+2=2, 2+0=2) maybe relates to the input's sum or other properties.\n\nAlternatively, the input matrix is placed in positions that correspond to their row and column indices in some transformed way. For example, the input's first row is placed in the (0,2) block (top-right) and the third row in the (2,0) block (bottom-left). But why?\n\nAnother angle: The output seems to be the result of some convolution-like operation where the input is placed at different positions with some shifts. For example, shifting the input by (0,6), (3,3), (6,0), etc. In Example2, the input is placed at (0,0), (0,6), (3,3), and (6,0). The shifts are multiples of 3 in either rows or columns. But how are these shifts determined?\n\nLooking at Example0, the input is placed at (3,0), which is a shift of 3 rows and 0 columns. Example1 has shifts of (0,6) and (6,0). Example2 has (0,0), (0,6), (3,3), (6,0).\n\nSo the shifts are combinations of 0, 3, and 6 in rows and columns. But how does the input determine which shifts to use?\n\nAnother idea: Each element in the input determines a shift vector. For example, the value of the element (0,0) determines where a copy of the input is placed. For example, if the value is 1, shift by (3,0), if 2, shift by (6,0), etc. But how?\n\nAlternatively, the sum of each row in the input determines the vertical shift, and the sum of each column determines the horizontal shift. Let's see:\n\nExample0's input rows sum to 1, 3, 1. Columns sum to 3, 1, 1. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the sum modulo 3 of each row and column could give the shift. For Example0, row sums mod3: 1,0,1. Column sums mod3:0,1,1. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the positions where the input is placed in the output correspond to the positions (i,j) where the input's element (i,j) is non-zero. For example, in Example0, the input has non-zero elements at (0,0), (1,0), (1,1), (2,2). Then the input matrix is placed in the output's blocks corresponding to these positions. For instance, (0,0) would mean placing the input in the top-left block of the output. But in Example0's output, the input is placed in the middle-left block (row3-5, col0-2), which corresponds to the (1,0) position in the 3x3 grid of blocks. Which is the position of the (1,0) element in the input. Wait, maybe each non-zero element in the input causes the entire input matrix to be placed in the block corresponding to its position. For example, if the input has a non-zero element at (i,j), then the input matrix is placed in the (i,j) block of the output's 3x3 grid of blocks.\n\nLet's check Example0:\n\nInput has non-zero elements at (0,0), (1,0), (1,1), (2,2).\n\nSo the output would have the input matrix placed in the (0,0), (1,0), (1,1), and (2,2) blocks of the 3x3 grid.\n\nBut in Example0's output, the input is only in the middle-left block (rows3-5, cols0-2), which corresponds to block (1,0) in the 3x3 grid of blocks (since each block is 3x3). So why only there?\n\nHmm. That doesn't fit. Because if (0,0) is non-zero, then the input should be placed in the top-left block. But in Example0's output, that's all zeros.\n\nWait, perhaps the value of the element determines which block to place the input. For example, if the element is 1, place the input in block (i,j) where (i,j) is the position of the element. If the element is 2, place it in two different blocks. But this is getting complicated.\n\nAlternatively, each non-zero element in the input matrix adds a copy of the input matrix to a specific block in the output. For example, a 1 in the input adds one copy, a 2 adds two copies. Let's see:\n\nIn Example0, the input has 1 at (0,0), (1,1), (2,2), and 2 at (1,0). So maybe this leads to placing the input in block (0,0), (1,1), (2,2) once each, and block (1,0) twice. But Example0's output has only one copy in block (1,0). That doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, the value of the element determines the number of shifts. For example, a 0 means no shift, 1 shifts the input down by 3 rows, 2 shifts down by 6 rows. Similarly for columns. But how?\n\nIn Example0's input, the first row is [1,0,0]. The 1 in (0,0) could mean shifting the input down by 3 rows (since 1 *3=3). The 2 in (1,0) would shift by 6 rows (2*3=6). But in Example0's output, the input is placed starting at row3 (assuming 0-based), which is 3 rows down. So perhaps the highest value in the input determines the vertical shift, and the horizontal shift is determined by another factor.\n\nAlternatively, the maximum value in the input matrix determines the number of copies. For example, max=2, so two copies. But Example0's max is 2 and has one copy. Example1's max is 2 and has two copies. Example2's max is 2 and has four copies. So that doesn't align.\n\nLet's try a different approach. Let's look at the output matrices and see if they can be broken down into 3x3 blocks. Each 3x3 block in the output is either a copy of the input matrix or zeros. The pattern seems to be that the input matrix is placed in multiple 3x3 blocks within the 9x9 output. The positions of these blocks vary between the examples.\n\nFor Example0, the input is placed in the (1,0) block (middle-left). For Example1, in (0,2) and (2,0) blocks (top-right and bottom-left). For Example2, in (0,0), (0,2), (1,1), (2,0) blocks.\n\nSo what's common between these positions? For Example0, (1,0) is the position of the element 2 in the input (since input[1][0] is 2). For Example1, input has 2 at (0,2). Perhaps the positions where the input is placed in the output correspond to the positions of the elements with the maximum value in the input.\n\nIn Example0, the maximum is 2, which is at (1,0). So the input is placed in the (1,0) block. In Example1, the maximum is 2, which is at (0,2). So the input is placed in (0,2) and (2,0) blocks. Wait, why two blocks? Maybe because the sum of the maximum elements' positions modulo 3? Or maybe the maximum elements' coordinates determine the placement.\n\nExample1's input has a 2 at (0,2). So perhaps placing the input in the (0,2) block. But why also in (2,0) block? Perhaps it's a diagonal reflection. (0,2) and (2,0) are symmetric with respect to the center.\n\nIn Example2, the input has maximum value 2 at positions (0,0), (0,2), (2,0). So the input is placed in those blocks. Wait, but the output has four placements. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each occurrence of the maximum value in the input leads to a placement in the corresponding block. For example, if the input has a maximum value at (i,j), then the input is placed in the (i,j) block of the output's 3x3 grid. \n\nExample0: max 2 at (1,0) \u2192 placed in (1,0) block. Correct.\n\nExample1: max 2 at (0,2) \u2192 placed in (0,2) block and maybe another due to some reflection. But the input is also placed in (2,0) block. Perhaps because the input's row sums or column sums have certain properties.\n\nExample2: max 2 at (0,0), (0,2), (2,0). So the input is placed in those blocks, but in the output, it's placed in (0,0), (0,2), (1,1), (2,0) blocks. So the (1,1) block is present even though the max isn't there. Hmm. This doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the input is placed in all blocks where the sum of the block's row and column indices equals some value. For Example0, block (1,0) sum is 1. Maybe the input's sum of elements is 1+3+1=5, which modulo 3 is 2. But not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the input is placed in the output's blocks that correspond to the coordinates of each element in the input matrix, multiplied by their value. For example, for each element a[i][j], the input matrix is placed in block (i * a[i][j], j * a[i][j]). But that may not fit.\n\nExample0's input has a 2 at (1,0). So 1*2=2, 0*2=0. Block (2,0). But in Example0's output, the input is placed in block (1,0). So that doesn't fit.\n\nThis is getting a bit stuck. Let's try to look for another pattern. In Example2's output, the input matrix is placed in four blocks. Looking at those blocks:\n\n- (0,0) top-left\n- (0,2) top-right\n- (1,1) center\n- (2,0) bottom-left\n\nThese positions form a diamond shape. The sum of the row and column indices for each block is:\n\n0+0=0, 0+2=2, 1+1=2, 2+0=2. So perhaps the sum is even? Or something else.\n\nAlternatively, these positions could be determined by a combination of the row and column indices of the input's elements. For example, for each element a[i][j], if it's non-zero, place the input in block (i, j), (i, 2-j), (2-i, j), etc. But not sure.\n\nAnother observation: The output for Example2 has the input in (0,0), (0,2), (1,1), (2,0). The positions (i,j) where i == j or i + j == 2. So those are the diagonal and anti-diagonal. So perhaps the input is placed in the diagonal and anti-diagonal blocks if certain conditions are met. But how does this relate to the input's values?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the number of times the input is placed depends on the number of times the maximum value appears in the input. For Example0, the max (2) occurs once \u2192 placed once. Example1, max occurs once \u2192 placed twice. Example2, max occurs three times \u2192 placed four times. Doesn't align.\n\nAnother approach: Let's consider the output for each example as a combination of the input matrix being placed at positions determined by each of its elements. For example, each element in the input contributes to the position where the entire input matrix is placed. \n\nFor instance, each element a[i][j] in the input adds the input matrix to the output at position (i*a[i][j], j*a[i][j]). But Example0's a[1][0] is 2. So 1*2=2 rows, 0*2=0 columns. But in Example0's output, the input starts at row3, which is 3 rows down. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, each element's value determines the offset. For example, a value of 1 adds an offset of 3, 2 adds 6. So the input is placed at (3*i, 3*j) multiplied by the element's value. \n\nExample0's input has a 1 at (0,0). So 3*0*1=0 rows, 3*0*1=0 columns \u2192 position (0,0). But the input is placed at row3. Hmm. Not matching.\n\nAlternatively, the offsets are determined by the element's value multiplied by 3. For example, if an element is 1, shift by 3 rows. If 2, shift by 6 rows. But then how are the shifts combined?\n\nExample0's input has 1 at (0,0). So shift row by 3*0 + 1*3=3. Column by 3*0 +0*3=0. So the input is placed at row3, column0. Which matches Example0's output. \n\nThen, for Example1's input, which has 2 at (0,2). The row shift would be 3*0 +2*3=6, column shift 3*2 +0*3=6. So the input is placed at row6, column6. But in Example1's output, the input is placed in the top-right and bottom-left blocks. So maybe each element contributes to a shift, and the input is placed at all shifts determined by their elements. \n\nBut how? Let's see.\n\nFor Example0:\n\nInput elements:\n\nRow0: [1,0,0] \u2192 element (0,0)=1. So row shift 3*0 +1*3=3, column shift 3*0 +0*3=0. So place input at (3,0).\n\nSimilarly, element (1,0)=2: row shift 3*1 +2*3=3+6=9, which is beyond the 9x9 matrix (rows are 0-8). So modulo 9? 9 mod9=0. Column shift 3*0 +0*3=0. So (0,0). But in the output, the input is only placed once. So perhaps only the element with the highest value contributes. \n\nThis is getting too convoluted. Let's try to think of another pattern.\n\nLooking at the output matrices:\n\nEach time the input is placed in the output, it's surrounded by zeros. For example, in Example0, the input is in rows3-5, columns0-2, and the rest are zeros. In Example1, the input is in two blocks, and the others are zeros. In Example2, four blocks.\n\nPerhaps the input is being placed in all possible positions where the row and column indices are congruent to some values modulo 3, based on the input's elements. For example, each element's value determines a congruence class for the rows and columns in the output.\n\nAlternatively, the output is a 3x3 tiling of the input matrix, where each tile is scaled by a certain factor. But how?\n\nWait, the output's 9x9 matrix can be viewed as a 3x3 grid of 3x3 blocks. For example, each block is labeled (m,n) where m and n are 0,1,2. Then, each block (m,n) is a 3x3 matrix. The pattern is that in certain blocks, the input matrix is placed, and others are zeros.\n\nThe question is: which blocks (m,n) contain the input matrix, and why?\n\nIn Example0, the input is placed in block (1,0).\n\nIn Example1, blocks (0,2) and (2,0).\n\nIn Example2, blocks (0,0), (0,2), (1,1), (2,0).\n\nLooking for a pattern in the block coordinates:\n\nExample0: (1,0)\n\nExample1: (0,2), (2,0)\n\nExample2: (0,0), (0,2), (1,1), (2,0)\n\nThe sum of m and n for these blocks:\n\nExample0: 1+0=1\n\nExample1: 0+2=2, 2+0=2\n\nExample2: 0+0=0, 0+2=2, 1+1=2, 2+0=2.\n\nHmm. So Example0's sum is 1, Example1's sums are both 2, Example2's sums are 0, 2, 2, 2.\n\nWhat determines the sum? Let's check the input matrices.\n\nExample0's input sum of elements: 1+0+0 + 2+1+0 +0+0+1 =5.\n\nExample1's sum:0+1+2+1+1+0+2+0+0=6.\n\nExample2's sum:2+1+2+0+2+1+2+1+0= 11.\n\nNot sure if the sum relates to the block coordinates' sums.\n\nAlternatively, the block coordinates (m,n) are determined by the indices of the input elements. For example, for each element a[i][j], if a[i][j] is non-zero, then block (i,j) contains the input.\n\nBut in Example0, there are non-zero elements at (0,0), (1,0), (1,1), (2,2). So blocks (0,0), (1,0), (1,1), (2,2) should have the input. But in Example0's output, only block (1,0) is present. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAnother approach: Let's look at the positions of the input in the output and see if they relate to the original positions in the input matrix. For Example2, the input is placed in four blocks. Let's see if each block corresponds to a different transformation of the input matrix. For example:\n\n- Block (0,0) is the original input.\n- Block (0,2) is the input flipped horizontally.\n- Block (2,0) is the input flipped vertically.\n- Block (1,1) is the input transposed or rotated.\n\nBut looking at the output for Example2:\n\nBlock (0,0) is the original input.\nBlock (0,2) is the same as the original input.\nBlock (2,0) is the original input.\nBlock (1,1) is the original input.\n\nSo all four blocks have the same input matrix. So that's not the case.\n\nAlternative idea: Each element in the input matrix is a code for which quadrant or block to place the input. For example, 0 means no placement, 1 means place in a specific block, 2 means place in another block.\n\nFor example, in Example0, the input has a 1 in (0,0) and 2 in (1,0). Maybe 1 corresponds to block (1,0) and 2 corresponds to another block. But why?\n\nThis is getting quite challenging. Let's try to find a pattern in the positions of the input matrix in the output across all examples.\n\nExample0: Middle-left block (1,0).\n\nExample1: Top-right (0,2) and bottom-left (2,0).\n\nExample2: Top-left (0,0), top-right (0,2), middle-center (1,1), bottom-left (2,0).\n\nSo the blocks where the input is placed seem to form a pattern that depends on some property of the input. Let's see:\n\nIn Example0, the input has a 2 in position (1,0). The output's block is (1,0). So perhaps when a cell has the maximum value (2), the input is placed in the block corresponding to that cell's position.\n\nIn Example1, the input has a 2 in (0,2), so the block (0,2) is filled. But also the block (2,0) is filled. Why? Maybe because of a diagonal reflection or transpose. (0,2) and (2,0) are symmetric with respect to the center.\n\nIn Example2, the input has 2s in (0,0), (0,2), (2,0). So the corresponding blocks (0,0), (0,2), (2,0) are filled. But why is (1,1) also filled? The input's (1,1) element is 2. Oh wait, in Example2's input, the element at (1,1) is 2? Let me check:\n\nExample2's input is:\n\n[2,1,2]\n[0,2,1]\n[2,1,0]\n\nThe element at (1,1) is 2. So the input has four elements with value 2: (0,0), (0,2), (1,1), (2,0). Each of these positions corresponds to a block in the output. Hence, the output has four blocks filled. That fits!\n\nSo the pattern seems to be: For each cell (i,j) in the input matrix, if the value of that cell is equal to the maximum value in the entire input matrix, then the entire input matrix is placed in the block (i,j) of the output's 3x3 grid of blocks. The other blocks are filled with zeros.\n\nLet's verify this with the examples.\n\nExample0's input:\n\n[1,0,0]\n[2,1,0]\n[0,0,1]\n\nThe maximum value is 2 (at (1,0)). So the input is placed in block (1,0) of the output, which is rows3-5, columns0-2. Which matches Example0's output.\n\nExample1's input:\n\n[0,1,2]\n[1,1,0]\n[2,0,0]\n\nMaximum value is 2 (at (0,2) and (2,0)). So the input is placed in blocks (0,2) and (2,0). Indeed, Example1's output has the input in the top-right and bottom-left blocks.\n\nExample2's input:\n\n[2,1,2]\n[0,2,1]\n[2,1,0]\n\nMaximum value is 2 (at (0,0), (0,2), (1,1), (2,0)). So the input is placed in blocks (0,0), (0,2), (1,1), (2,0). Looking at Example2's output, those blocks are indeed filled with the input matrix.\n\nYes! This seems to be the pattern. So the rule is: For each cell (i,j) in the input matrix, if the cell's value is equal to the maximum value in the input, then the entire input matrix is placed into the corresponding block (i,j) of the output's 3x3 grid of 3x3 blocks. All other blocks are filled with zeros.\n\nNow, applying this to the test input:\n\nTest Input:\n[1, 2, 2]\n[2, 0, 1]\n[1, 2, 0]\n\nFirst, find the maximum value. The elements are 1,2,2,2,0,1,1,2,0. The maximum is 2. Which cells have value 2?\n\nLooking at each cell:\n\n(0,1) \u2192 2\n\n(0,2) \u2192 2\n\n(1,0) \u2192 2\n\n(2,1) \u2192 2\n\nSo there are four cells with value 2. Therefore, the input matrix should be placed in the blocks (0,1), (0,2), (1,0), and (2,1) of the output's 3x3 grid.\n\nNow, each block is a 3x3 section of the output matrix. Let's construct the 9x9 output matrix.\n\nFirst, initialize all blocks to zeros. Then, for each of the four blocks:\n\nBlock (0,1) \u2192 rows0-2, columns3-5.\n\nBlock (0,2) \u2192 rows0-2, columns6-8.\n\nBlock (1,0) \u2192 rows3-5, columns0-2.\n\nBlock (2,1) \u2192 rows6-8, columns3-5.\n\nIn each of these blocks, place the input matrix.\n\nSo, for example, in block (0,1), the input's first row [1,2,2] would be placed in rows0-2, columns3-5. But wait, the block is 3x3, so each row of the input is placed in the corresponding row of the block.\n\nSo block (0,1) would be:\n\nRow0: columns3=1, 4=2,5=2.\n\nRow1: columns3=2,4=0,5=1.\n\nRow2: columns3=1,4=2,5=0.\n\nSimilarly for other blocks.\n\nNow, let's construct the output step by step.\n\nInitialize all 9x9 elements to 0.\n\nThen, fill the blocks:\n\nBlock (0,1): rows0-2, columns3-5.\n\nInput matrix:\n\nRow0: 1,2,2 \u2192 columns3=1,4=2,5=2.\n\nRow1:2,0,1 \u2192 columns3=2,4=0,5=1.\n\nRow2:1,2,0 \u2192 columns3=1,4=2,5=0.\n\nBlock (0,2): rows0-2, columns6-8.\n\nInput matrix:\n\nRow0: columns6=1,7=2,8=2.\n\nRow1: columns6=2,7=0,8=1.\n\nRow2: columns6=1,7=2,8=0.\n\nBlock (1,0): rows3-5, columns0-2.\n\nInput matrix:\n\nRow0: columns0=1,1=2,2=2.\n\nRow1: columns0=2,1=0,2=1.\n\nRow2: columns0=1,1=2,2=0.\n\nBlock (2,1): rows6-8, columns3-5.\n\nInput matrix:\n\nRow0: columns3=1,4=2,5=2.\n\nRow1: columns3=2,4=0,5=1.\n\nRow2: columns3=1,4=2,5=0.\n\nAdditionally, any overlapping between blocks would be overwritten, but since the blocks are distinct, there's no overlap here.\n\nPutting it all together, the output should have the input matrix in these four blocks, and zeros elsewhere.\n\nLet's check if this matches the expected pattern.\n\nThe final output matrix would look like this (written in rows):\n\nRow0: [0,0,0,1,2,2,1,2,2]\n\nRow1: [0,0,0,2,0,1,2,0,1]\n\nRow2: [0,0,0,1,2,0,1,2,0]\n\nRows3-5:\n\nRow3: [1,2,2,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow4: [2,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow5: [1,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRows6-8:\n\nRow6: [0,0,0,1,2,2,0,0,0]\n\nRow7: [0,0,0,2,0,1,0,0,0]\n\nRow8: [0,0,0,1,2,0,0,0,0]\n\nWait, no. Wait, block (2,1) is rows6-8, columns3-5. So:\n\nRow6: columns3-5 are 1,2,2 \u2192 from input row0.\n\nRow7: columns3-5 are 2,0,1 \u2192 input row1.\n\nRow8: columns3-5 are 1,2,0 \u2192 input row2.\n\nBut the rest of these rows (columns0-2 and 6-8) are zeros.\n\nSo the complete rows would be:\n\nRow0: [0,0,0,1,2,2,1,2,2]\n\nRow1: [0,0,0,2,0,1,2,0,1]\n\nRow2: [0,0,0,1,2,0,1,2,0]\n\nRow3: [1,2,2,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow4: [2,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow5: [1,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow6: [0,0,0,1,2,2,0,0,0]\n\nRow7: [0,0,0,2,0,1,0,0,0]\n\nRow8: [0,0,0,1,2,0,0,0,0]\n\nLet me verify this with the training examples' pattern. For example, Example1's output has input placed in two blocks. Similarly, this test case has four blocks filled. The structure matches the examples where each block is filled with the input matrix in the appropriate position.\n\nTherefore, this should be the correct output."
