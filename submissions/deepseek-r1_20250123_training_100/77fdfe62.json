        "cot_1": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. So, the problem is to transform the input grid into the output grid based on some pattern observed in the training examples. Let's look at the examples one by one.\n\nStarting with Example 0. The input is an 8x8 grid, and the output is a 4x4 grid. The output rows are shorter. Let me see the input and output side by side.\n\nInput rows:\n[2,1,0,0,0,0,1,3]\n[1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1]\n[0,1,0,8,0,0,1,0]\n[0,1,8,8,0,8,1,0]\n[0,1,0,0,8,0,1,0]\n[0,1,8,0,8,8,1,0]\n[1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1]\n[4,1,0,0,0,0,1,6]\n\nOutput:\n[0,2,0,0]\n[2,2,0,3]\n[0,0,6,0]\n[4,0,6,6]\n\nHmm. Notice that the input has 8 rows, output 4. Maybe each output row is formed by combining two input rows? Let's check. For example, the first output row [0,2,0,0]. The first two input rows are [2,1,0,0,0,0,1,3] and [1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1]. How do these combine? Maybe looking at the non-zero elements. The output's first element is 0. Then the second element is 2. The input's first row starts with 2. Wait, maybe the output is taking certain elements from the corners or the edges of the input?\n\nWait, looking at the first and last elements of the input rows. The first input row starts with 2 and ends with 3. The last input row starts with 4 and ends with 6. The output's first row has 0,2,0,0. Maybe that's not directly those numbers. Alternatively, maybe each output cell is derived from a 2x2 block in the input. For example, combining two rows and two columns.\n\nLooking at the output dimensions: the example 0 input is 8x8, output is 4x4. So each dimension is halved. So maybe each output cell corresponds to a 2x2 block in the input.\n\nBut how? Let's take the first 2x2 block of the input (top-left corner):\n\n2,1\n1,1\n\nWhat's the corresponding output value in the first position of the first output row? It's 0. Not sure. Alternatively, maybe the output is constructed by taking elements from specific positions in the input.\n\nLooking at the output rows in Example 0. The first output row is [0,2,0,0]. Let's see where 2 comes from. In the input's first row, the first element is 2. Then, in the output, the second element is 2. Hmm, maybe the output is formed by taking the corners of the input grid. Let's check the input grid's corners:\n\nFirst row's first element is 2, last is 3. Last row's first is 4, last is 6. The output's first row has 0, 2, 0, 0. The second output row starts with 2, then 2. Maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps the output is formed by elements from the borders of the input, but the middle rows are processed in a certain way.\n\nAnother approach: Looking at the 8s in the input. The output has numbers like 6 in example 0. Maybe the count of 8s in certain regions? Let's check example 0's third input row: [0,1,0,8,0,0,1,0]. Then the fourth row has two 8s. The output's third row is [0,0,6,0]. Maybe the 6 comes from the sum of 8s in some 2x2 blocks. Wait, 8+8+0+8=24, but 24 isn't 6. Alternatively, maybe the number of 8s in each 2x2 block. Let's see: For example, in the input rows 3 and 4 (third and fourth rows):\n\nRow3: 0,1,0,8,0,0,1,0\n\nRow4:0,1,8,8,0,8,1,0\n\nIf we look at columns 0-1 in these two rows: 0,1 and 0,1. No 8s here. Columns 2-3: 0,8 and 8,8. That's three 8s. So count is 3. But in the output's third row, first element is 0. Hmm. Maybe not. Alternatively, maybe the sum of the 8s, but divided by 4? 3*8=24, 24/4=6. Oh! Wait, that would give 6. So in that 2x2 block (columns 2-3, rows 3-4), sum is 0+8+8+8 =24. 24 divided by 4 is 6. So the output cell would be 6. And in the output example 0's third row, third element is 6. So that could be a match. Let's check another part.\n\nTake another 2x2 block. Let's look at the last two rows of the input (rows 7 and 8, but wait example 0's input is 8 rows). Wait, rows 7 is [4,1,0,0,0,0,1,6]. And the output's last row is [4,0,6,6]. Let's see the blocks for the last output row.\n\nThe first element of the output's last row is 4. The corresponding block would be rows 7 and 8, but there are 8 rows. Wait, maybe the input is split into 2-row pairs. For example, rows 0-1, 2-3, 4-5, 6-7. Then each pair of rows is processed into an output row. So for each pair of rows, process two rows at a time, and create an output row by processing each 2x2 block (since each output row is 4 elements, the original input has 8 elements per row, so 8/2=4 per row in output). So each output element is derived from a 2x2 block in the input.\n\nSo, for example, the first output row in example 0 is [0,2,0,0]. Let's see the corresponding 2x2 blocks in the first two rows (rows 0 and 1 of input):\n\nRow0: [2,1,0,0,0,0,1,3]\n\nRow1: [1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1]\n\nThe first 2x2 block is:\n\n2 1\n\n1 1\n\nThe sum of these elements is 2+1+1+1 =5. But 5 divided by 4 is 1.25, which isn't 0. So maybe it's not the average. Alternatively, maybe it's the sum of the 8s in the block. But there are no 8s here. So 0, which matches the first element of the output.\n\nWait, the first element of the output is 0, and that block has no 8s. Then the second element of the output is 2. Let's look at the next 2x2 block in rows 0 and 1, columns 2-3:\n\n0 0\n\n1 1\n\nAgain, no 8s. Sum is 0+0+1+1=2. Wait, but the output is 2 here. Oh! Wait, if the output is the sum of the non-8 numbers in the 2x2 block, and if there are any 8s, they are replaced by the count of 8s multiplied by something. Wait, maybe not. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the sum of the numbers in the 2x2 block, but 8s are treated as 0. Or perhaps, the 8s are ignored, and the sum is of the other numbers. Let's test this.\n\nFirst block: rows 0-1, columns 0-1:\n\n2,1\n\n1,1\n\nSum of non-8s: 2+1+1+1=5. The output is 0. Hmm, doesn't match. Alternatively, perhaps it's the count of 8s in the block. But here there are none, so 0. So that matches the first output element. The second output element is 2. Let's look at the next block in rows 0-1, columns 2-3:\n\n0,0\n\n1,1\n\nNo 8s again. Sum of 8s is 0. So output should be 0. But the output here is 2. Hmm, that's conflicting.\n\nWait, maybe the output is the sum of the non-1, non-8 elements. Because in example 0's input, the first row has 2 and 3, the second row is all 1s. Let's check the first block again:\n\nIn rows 0-1, columns 0-1: elements are 2,1,1,1. The non-1 and non-8 elements are 2. So sum is 2. So output is 2. But the first output element in example 0's first row is 0. That doesn't fit. Maybe this approach isn't right.\n\nAlternative idea: The output is formed by elements from the first and last rows, and the middle rows are processed for 8s. For example, in example 0's output, the first row's second element is 2. The first row of the input starts with 2. The last input row starts with 4 and ends with 6, and the output's last row starts with 4 and ends with 6. But how are the other elements filled in?\n\nLooking at example 1's input and output. The input is 6x6, output is 2x2. The first output row is [9,4], which are the first and last elements of the first input row. The second output row is [2,3], which are the first and last elements of the last input row. Wait, example 1's input is:\n\n[9, 1, 0, 0, 1, 4]\n\n[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]\n\n[0, 1, 8, 8, 1, 0]\n\n[0, 1, 8, 0, 1, 0]\n\n[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]\n\n[2, 1, 0, 0, 1, 3]\n\nThe output is [[9,4], [2,0]]. Wait, the last input row is [2,1,0,0,1,3], which has first element 2 and last 3. But the output's second row is [2,0]. Hmm, that's not matching. So maybe that's not the pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is constructed by taking the corners of the input grid. For example, in example 0's input, the corners are 2 (top-left), 3 (top-right), 4 (bottom-left), 6 (bottom-right). The output's first row has 0,2,0,0. The last row of output has 4,0,6,6. So the 4 and 6 are present, but not sure.\n\nAnother approach: looking at the 8s. The output seems to have numbers like 6, which could be the count of 8s in certain regions. For example, in example 0's output third row [0,0,6,0], the 6 may come from the sum of 8s in a 2x2 block. Let's check. In the input, rows 3 and 4 (third and fourth) of example 0:\n\nRow3: [0,1,8,8,0,8,1,0]\n\nRow4: [0,1,0,0,8,0,1,0]\n\nWait, no. Wait, rows are 0-based. Let me get the correct rows. The third row (index 2) in example 0's input is [0,1,0,8,0,0,1,0], the fourth row (index3) is [0,1,8,8,0,8,1,0]. So the 2x2 block for columns 2-3 and rows 2-3:\n\nRow2: 0,8 (columns 2 and 3)\n\nRow3:8,8 (columns 2 and 3)\n\nSo the block is:\n\n0 8\n\n8 8\n\nSum of 8s here is 0 (since 0 is not 8) +8+8+8=24. 24 divided by 4 is 6. So maybe each output cell is the average of the 8s in the 2x2 block, treating non-8s as 0. So sum of 8s in the block divided by 4. So 24 /4=6, which matches the output's third row third element. That seems to fit.\n\nAnother check: example 0's output second row is [2,2,0,3]. Let's see the corresponding 2x2 blocks. For the first element of the second output row (which is row index 1 in the output), it corresponds to input rows 2 and 3. Wait no: since the output rows are half the input, perhaps each output row is formed by two input rows. For example, output row 0 is input rows 0 and 1, output row 1 is input rows 2 and 3, etc. So each output row is a pair of input rows.\n\nSo for output row 0 (example 0's first output row), it's input rows 0 and 1. Then for each element in the output row, take a 2x2 block (columns in steps of 2). For example, first element of output row 0 is the block from columns 0-1 in rows 0-1.\n\nLet's see:\n\nBlock for first element of output row 0 (example 0):\n\nRow0: 2,1\n\nRow1:1,1\n\nSum of 8s is 0 (no 8s here). Sum is 0, divided by 4 gives 0. So output is 0. Which matches.\n\nSecond element of output row 0: columns 2-3, rows 0-1.\n\nRow0:0,0\n\nRow1:1,1\n\nNo 8s. Sum is 0, so output 0. But the actual output here is 2. Hmm, this contradicts.\n\nWait, maybe the output element is not based on 8s but on other numbers. Alternatively, maybe the sum of the numbers in the 2x2 block, but with 8s contributing to a separate count.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is the sum of the first and last elements of each pair of rows, but that seems unclear.\n\nWait, maybe the output is constructed by taking the first and last elements of certain rows and columns. For example, in example 1's output, the first row is [9,4], which are the first and last elements of the first input row. The second output row is [2,0], which are the first element of the last input row (2) and the last element of the fourth input row (0). Not sure.\n\nAnother observation: The input grids seem to have a border of 1s. For example, in example 0's input, rows 1 and 6 are all 1s. The output seems to exclude those rows. For example, example 0's output has 4 rows, which would correspond to the input rows 0,2,4,6, but no. Because the input has 8 rows, and the output 4 rows. So maybe the output is formed by every other row, skipping the rows filled with 1s. Wait, in example 0, the rows filled with 1s are 1 and 6. The output rows are 0,2,3,4, etc. Not sure.\n\nLooking at example 1's input: rows 1 and 4 are all 1s. The output is 2 rows, which correspond to the first and last input rows. So in example 1's output, the first row is [9,4] (from input row 0), and the second row is [2,0] (from input row 5). So perhaps the output consists of the first and last rows (excluding the 1-filled rows), and then processing their elements. But how?\n\nAlternatively, the output is formed by taking the first and last elements of the first and last rows (excluding the 1-filled rows). But in example 0's output, the first row has elements 0,2,0,0. The first row of the input (row 0) is [2,1,0,0,0,0,1,3]. So the first and last elements are 2 and 3. But the output row starts with 0 and 2. Hmm, that doesn't align.\n\nAnother idea: Looking at the output rows, perhaps they are derived from the corners of the input grid. For example, example 0's output first row has 0,2,0,0. The 2 might be from the top-left corner of the input (2). The last element of the first output row is 0, but the input's top-right is 3. Not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps the output is combining elements from the first and last rows, but also from the middle rows where 8s are present. Let's consider example 0 again. The output's third row is [0,0,6,0]. The 6 could be related to the sum of 8s in the middle rows. For example, in the input's third row (row 2), there is an 8. But how does that translate to 6 in the output?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is made by taking the non-1 and non-8 elements from the borders and the sum of 8s from the middle regions. For example, the first and last elements of the first and last input rows are taken as they are (if they are not 1 or 8), and the middle rows are processed for 8 counts.\n\nBut example 0's first input row is [2,1,0,0,0,0,1,3]. The non-1 and non-8 elements are 2, 0,0,0,0,3. But the output's first row is [0,2,0,0]. Maybe taking the first element (2) and last element (3) from the first row, but how?\n\nAlternatively, the output is a combination of the first and last elements of certain rows, and for the middle rows, the count of 8s in certain columns.\n\nAnother observation: The output arrays in all examples have even numbers. For example, 2, 6, 4, etc. This could suggest that they are sums or counts multiplied by something.\n\nWait, let's try to see in example 0:\n\nThe output has:\n\nRow0: [0,2,0,0]\n\nRow1: [2,2,0,3]\n\nRow2: [0,0,6,0]\n\nRow3: [4,0,6,6]\n\nLooking at the numbers 2,3,4,6. These are present in the first and last rows of the input. For instance, 2 is the first element of input row 0, 3 is the last. 4 is first of row7, 6 is last of row7. Then, the other numbers like 6 in the output could be related to the sum of 8s in certain regions. For example, in example 0's row3 (input) and row4, there are several 8s. The output's row2 and row3 have 6s, which may be the sum of 8s in 2x2 blocks divided by 4, as earlier thought.\n\nSo combining these two ideas: the output takes the first and last elements of the first and last rows (excluding the all-1 rows), and for the middle rows, it sums the 8s in 2x2 blocks and divides by 4.\n\nBut how exactly?\n\nIn example 0's input:\n\nFirst row (row0): [2,1,0,0,0,0,1,3]\n\nLast row (row7): [4,1,0,0,0,0,1,6]\n\nThe output's first row has 0,2,0,0. The second element is 2, which is the first element of row0. The last element of the first output row is 0. But row0's last element is 3. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking the first and last elements of the first and last rows (excluding the all-1 rows) and the sum of 8s in the middle.\n\nWait, example 0's input has all-1 rows at rows1 and 6. The other rows are 0,2,3,4,5,7. So the non-1 rows are rows0, 2,3,4,5,7.\n\nThe output has 4 rows. Maybe the output is composed of the first and last rows (rows0 and7) and the middle rows (2,3,4,5) processed in some way.\n\nBut how does that lead to the output?\n\nAlternatively, the output is created by combining the first and last rows (excluding the all-1s) and processing the middle rows.\n\nBut in example 0, the output has four rows. The first output row could be from the first input row, the last from the last input row, and the middle two from the middle rows.\n\nBut how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is formed by taking pairs of non-1 rows. For example:\n\nRows0 and7 are the first and last, so they form the first and last output rows. Then rows2-3 and 4-5 form the middle output rows.\n\nBut example 0's output is four rows. So rows0, 2, 4, 7? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the output is formed by rows that are not all-1s. So in example0, there are 6 such rows (rows0,2,3,4,5,7). But the output has 4 rows. So maybe they are merged somehow.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Let's try to find a more concrete pattern.\n\nLooking at example 2's input and output:\n\nInput rows:\n\n[6,1,0,0,0,0,1,2]\n\n[1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1]\n\n[0,1,0,8,0,8,1,0]\n\n[0,1,8,8,8,0,1,0]\n\n[0,1,8,0,8,8,1,0]\n\n[0,1,8,8,8,0,1,0]\n\n[1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1]\n\n[7,1,0,0,0,0,1,4]\n\nOutput:\n\n[0,6,0,2]\n\n[6,6,2,0]\n\n[7,0,4,4]\n\n[7,7,4,0]\n\nThe first output row is [0,6,0,2]. The first input row is [6,1,0,0,0,0,1,2]. The last element of this row is 2. The first element is 6. The output row has 6 and 2. Hmm. The first output element is 0, maybe from processing other rows.\n\nThe second output row is [6,6,2,0]. Where do these numbers come from? 6 and 2 are from the first input row, but why are they repeated?\n\nWait, looking at example2's output rows:\n\nRow0: 0,6,0,2\n\nRow1:6,6,2,0\n\nRow2:7,0,4,4\n\nRow3:7,7,4,0\n\nThe first and third output rows have elements from the first and last input rows (6,2 and7,4), and the other rows have 6 and 7 in them. The 0s and other numbers might be coming from processing the 8s in the middle rows.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is created by:\n\n- For the first and last rows of the input (excluding the all-1s rows), take the first and last elements. For example, in example2, the first row (row0) has 6 and 2. The last row (row7) has7 and4. So the first and last output rows would have these values. But the output's first row is [0,6,0,2], which has 6 and 2, but the third output row is [7,0,4,4], which has7 and4. So maybe each of these is part of the output.\n\nThe middle output rows (row1 and row3) might be processing the 8s in the middle input rows. For example, the second output row in example2 is [6,6,2,0]. The numbers 6 and 2 are from the first row's first and last elements. But why? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the middle output rows are created by looking at the 8s in the middle input rows. For example, let's take example2's middle input rows (rows2-5):\n\nRow2: [0,1,0,8,0,8,1,0]\n\nRow3: [0,1,8,8,8,0,1,0]\n\nRow4: [0,1,8,0,8,8,1,0]\n\nRow5: [0,1,8,8,8,0,1,0]\n\nThese rows have 8s. The output rows 1 and 3 of example2 are [6,6,2,0] and [7,7,4,0]. The 6 and 7 might come from the first and last input rows (6 and7). The 2 and4 are from the first and last rows. But how?\n\nAlternatively, the middle output rows are created by summing the 8s in certain regions. For example, the output row1 has 6,6,2,0. The 6s could be the sum of 8s in certain blocks divided by4. Let's check:\n\nTake example2's row2 and row3. Columns0-1:\n\nRow2: 0,1\n\nRow3:0,1\n\nNo 8s. So sum 0, divided by4=0. But output row1's first element is6. Doesn't match. Columns2-3:\n\nRow2:0,8\n\nRow3:8,8\n\nSum of 8s:8+8+8=24. 24/4=6. So output element is6. Which matches the first element of row1's output (6). Then next block columns4-5:\n\nRow2:0,8\n\nRow3:8,0\n\nSum of 8s:8+8=16. 16/4=4. But the output's row1's third element is2. Hmm, doesn't match.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the blocks are rows2-3 and columns0-1,2-3,4-5,6-7.\n\nFor example, the first block of row2-3, columns0-1: no 8s, sum 0. So output 0. But output row1's first element is6. So that's not matching.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is built by taking the first and last elements of the first and last rows, and for the middle rows, processing the 8s in a certain way. For example, the first element of the first output row is the first element of the first input row (6 in example2), but in example0's first output row, the first element is0. That doesn't fit. Hmm.\n\nThis is really challenging. Let's try to see if there's a pattern in the output dimensions. For example:\n\n- Example0's input is 8x8, output is 4x4. So each dimension is halved.\n\n- Example1's input is 6x6, output is 2x2. So again, 6/3=2? Or 6/2=3, but output is 2. Not sure.\n\n- Example2's input is8x8, output4x4.\n\nTest input is 10x10, so output should be5x5? But the examples don't follow that. Wait, example1's input is6x6, output2x2. 6/3=2. So maybe the output dimensions are input dimensions divided by 3. But example0's input 8/3 is 2.66, which doesn't fit. So that's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, the output dimensions are (n/2) x (n/2) when the input is n x n. But example0 and example2 are 8x8 input, 4x4 output. Example1 is 6x6 input, 2x2 output. 6/2=3, but the output is 2x2. So that's not matching.\n\nWait, example1's input is6 rows, output is2 rows. 6-2=4, which is the number of all-1 rows. In example1's input, there are two all-1 rows (row1 and row4). So 6 input rows minus 2 all-1 rows gives4 rows, but output is2. So maybe each pair of non-1 rows is combined into one output row.\n\nSo in example0, there are 8 input rows. All-1 rows are rows1 and6. So remaining rows are 0,2,3,4,5,7. That's 6 rows. Divided into pairs: (0,2), (3,4), (5,7), but that would give 3 output rows, but example0's output has4 rows. So that's not matching.\n\nThis approach doesn't seem to work.\n\nAlternative idea: The output is formed by taking the first and last elements of each row, excluding the all-1 rows. For example, in example1:\n\nInput rows excluding all-1 rows are row0, row2, row3, row5.\n\nRow0: [9,1,0,0,1,4] \u2192 first and last are9 and4.\n\nRow2: [0,1,8,8,1,0] \u2192 first and last are0 and0.\n\nRow3: [0,1,8,0,1,0] \u2192 first and last are0 and0.\n\nRow5: [2,1,0,0,1,3] \u2192 first and last are2 and3.\n\nBut the output is [[9,4], [2,0]]. Hmm, combining row0's elements and row5's elements. So maybe taking the first and last rows of the non-1 rows. Row0 is first, row5 is last. Their first and last elements give [9,4] and [2,3]. But the output's second row is [2,0]. Not matching.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is formed by the first and last elements of the first and last non-1 rows, and for the middle non-1 rows, something else.\n\nBut example1's output is two rows. The first row is [9,4], which are from row0's first and last. The second row is [2,0], which are from row5's first and row3's last. Not sure.\n\nLet's try another angle. Looking at example0's output:\n\n[0,2,0,0]\n\n[2,2,0,3]\n\n[0,0,6,0]\n\n[4,0,6,6]\n\nLooking at the numbers, 2,3,4,6 are from the first and last rows. The 6s are likely from summing 8s. So perhaps the output is a combination of:\n\n- For the first and last rows (excluding all-1s), take their elements at certain positions.\n\n- For the middle rows (excluding all-1s), compute the sum of 8s in certain regions.\n\nBut how to map which elements go where?\n\nAnother observation: The output arrays have the same numbers as the corners of the input array. For example, in example0, the input's first row starts with2 and ends with3. The last row starts with4 and ends with6. The output includes 2,3,4,6. The 6 could be from summing 8s, but 4 is from the last row's first element. So maybe the output's corners are taken from the input's corners, and the middle elements are derived from the 8s.\n\nBut in example0's output:\n\nFirst row: [0,2,0,0]\n\nSecond row: [2,2,0,3]\n\nThird row: [0,0,6,0]\n\nFourth row: [4,0,6,6]\n\nThe corners of the output are 0 (top-left), 0 (top-right),4 (bottom-left),6 (bottom-right). These are not all the input's corners (input's top-left is2, top-right3, bottom-left4, bottom-right6). So the output's bottom-right is6, which matches the input's bottom-right. But the top-left of the output is0, which is not the input's 2. Hmm.\n\nThis is getting too time-consuming. Let's try to hypothesize a pattern and test it.\n\nHypothesis: Each output cell is the sum of the 8s in a 2x2 block of the input, divided by 4. For non-8 numbers, they contribute to the output if they are in the first or last row, and their positions are adjusted.\n\nFor example, in example0's first input row (row0), which is [2,1,0,0,0,0,1,3], the 2 and3 are in the first and last positions. These might be placed in certain positions in the output.\n\nBut how? For example, in example0's output, the second row has 2 and3 in the first and last positions. The first row has 2 in the second position.\n\nAlternatively, the output is a combination of elements from the first and last rows (excluding 1s) and processed 8s from the middle rows.\n\nAlternatively, the output is built as follows:\n\n- The first and last elements of the first and last rows (excluding all-1s) become the corners of the output.\n\n- The middle elements are derived from the sum of 8s in 2x2 blocks of the middle rows.\n\nBut example0's output has more elements than just corners. So perhaps the output is a grid where:\n\n- The first and last rows of the output are derived from the first and last rows of the input.\n\n- The middle rows of the output are derived from the sum of 8s in the middle rows of the input.\n\nBut how?\n\nAlternatively, the output is a grid formed by the following steps:\n\n1. Remove all rows filled with 1s.\n\n2. For the remaining rows, for each pair of consecutive rows, merge them into a single row by taking every other element or processing 2x2 blocks.\n\nBut example0 has after removing rows1 and6, six rows. Merging pairs would give three rows, but the output has four. So that's not matching.\n\nAlternatively, after removing the all-1 rows, take the first and last rows and process the middle rows for 8s.\n\nIn example0, after removing rows1 and6, the remaining rows are0,2,3,4,5,7. The output has four rows. So perhaps take the first, third, fifth, and seventh rows (0,3,5,7). Then process each of these rows into the output.\n\nBut row0 is [2,1,0,0,0,0,1,3], row3 is [0,1,8,8,0,8,1,0], row5 is [0,1,8,0,8,8,1,0], row7 is [4,1,0,0,0,0,1,6].\n\nNow, how do these rows become the output?\n\nThe output rows are:\n\n[0,2,0,0]\n\n[2,2,0,3]\n\n[0,0,6,0]\n\n[4,0,6,6]\n\nLooking at row0 of the input, the output's first row is [0,2,0,0]. Perhaps taking elements from even indices or something. For example, row0's elements are [2,1,0,0,0,0,1,3]. Taking every other element starting from index1: 1,0,0,1. Not matching.\n\nAlternatively, the output row is derived from the non-1 and non-8 elements of the input row. For row0, the non-1 elements are 2,0,0,0,0,3. But the output row is [0,2,0,0]. How?\n\nAlternatively, the output is the input's non-1 and non-8 elements, but arranged in a certain way. For example, row0's non-1 elements are 2,0,0,0,0,3. The output row has 2 and 0s. Not sure.\n\nThis is really tricky. Let's try to look for another pattern in the examples.\n\nIn example0's output, the numbers 2,3,4,6 are the non-1 and non-8 elements from the first and last rows. The other numbers (0 and 6) are derived from the 8s in the middle rows.\n\nPerhaps the output is a combination of the first and last rows' non-1 and non-8 elements, and the sum of 8s in the middle rows divided by4.\n\nFor example, example0's first row is [2,1,0,0,0,0,1,3]. The non-1 and non-8 elements are 2,0,0,0,0,3. These are arranged somehow into the output. But the first output row is [0,2,0,0], which has 2 as the second element. Maybe the 2 and3 are placed in specific positions.\n\nAnother observation: The output arrays in the examples have a certain symmetry. For example, example0's output has a 2 and 3 in the second row, and 4 and6 in the fourth row. The middle rows have 6s. This might suggest that the first and last rows of the output correspond to the first and last rows of the input, and the middle rows process the 8s.\n\nBut I'm not making progress. Let's try to focus on the 8s. The outputs have numbers like 6, which is 24/4. That suggests that for each 2x2 block in the middle rows (with 8s), the sum of the 8s divided by4 gives the output number. Then, for the first and last rows, the non-1, non-8 numbers are placed in specific positions.\n\nSo, the process could be:\n\n1. Remove all rows filled with 1s.\n\n2. For each remaining row:\n\n   a. If it's the first or last row, take certain elements (like first and last, or others).\n\n   b. For other rows, process 2x2 blocks by summing 8s and dividing by4.\n\nBut how to map this to the output structure.\n\nAlternatively, the output is formed as follows:\n\n- The first and last rows of the output are formed from the first and last non-1 rows of the input.\n\n- The middle rows of the output are formed by processing pairs of non-1 rows from the input, summing 8s in 2x2 blocks.\n\nBut in example0, the non-1 rows are0,2,3,4,5,7. So output has4 rows. So maybe the middle rows are processed from pairs of non-1 rows.\n\nFor example, output rows:\n\nRow0: row0 of input (first non-1 row)\n\nRow1: rows2 and3 processed\n\nRow2: rows4 and5 processed\n\nRow3: row7 of input (last non-1 row)\n\nThen, for row1 and row2 of the output, each element is the sum of 8s in a 2x2 block of the corresponding input rows divided by4.\n\nFor example, in example0's output row1: [2,2,0,3]. Let's see what 2s and 3 are.\n\nWait, input rows2 and3:\n\nRow2: [0,1,0,8,0,0,1,0]\n\nRow3: [0,1,8,8,0,8,1,0]\n\nProcessing these two rows. For each 2x2 block:\n\nColumns0-1: 0,1 (row2) and 0,1 (row3). Sum of 8s: 0. So 0/4=0. But output row1's first element is2.\n\nNot matching. Alternatively, maybe the first and last elements of the non-1 rows are taken. For row0 of input (non-1), first element is2, last is3. For row7, first is4, last is6. These are present in the output's first and last rows.\n\nFor the middle output rows, they are formed by processing the sum of 8s in 2x2 blocks from pairs of non-1 rows.\n\nIn example0's output row1: [2,2,0,3]. The 2s and3 might come from row0's elements. But this isn't clear.\n\nThis is really challenging. Given the time I'm taking, perhaps I should try to form a rule based on the examples and apply it to the test input.\n\nAnother idea: The output is formed by taking the first and last elements of the first and last rows (excluding all-1s), and for the middle rows, each element is the count of 8s in a vertical 2x1 column from two rows.\n\nWait, in example0's input rows2 and3 (third and fourth rows):\n\nRow2: 0,1,0,8,0,0,1,0\n\nRow3:0,1,8,8,0,8,1,0\n\nFor a vertical column (e.g., column3):\n\nRow2:8\n\nRow3:8\n\nCount of 8s is 2. But in output row1's third element is0. Doesn't match.\n\nAlternatively, sum of 8s in two rows for each column. For example, column3:8+8=16. 16/4=4. But output row1's third element is0.\n\nNot matching.\n\nAlternatively, for each pair of rows (like row2 and row3), sum the 8s in each column pair. For example, columns0-1, sum of 8s in row2 and row3 for columns0-1: 0+0=0. Columns2-3: 0+8 +8+8=24. 24/4=6. Which would correspond to 6 in the output. But in example0's output row1, the third element is0. Not matching.\n\nThis is frustrating. Let me try to see if there's a pattern in the output elements' positions.\n\nExample0's output:\n\nRow0: [0,2,0,0]\n\nRow1: [2,2,0,3]\n\nRow2: [0,0,6,0]\n\nRow3: [4,0,6,6]\n\nNoticing that the numbers 2,3,4,6 are the first and last elements of the first and last rows. For example, 2 is from row0's first element,3 from row0's last,4 from row7's first,6 from row7's last. These numbers appear in the output's first and last rows, and in the middle rows, the numbers 2 and3 appear again. The 6s are probably from processing 8s.\n\nAnother observation: In example0's output, the number 2 appears in the first and second rows, which might correspond to the first row of the input. The number3 appears in the second row's last element, which is the last element of the input's first row. The number4 appears in the last row's first element, which is the first element of the input's last row. The number6 appears in the last row's last element and other positions.\n\nThis suggests that the output's elements are a combination of the first and last elements of the first and last rows, and the sum of 8s in the middle. The positions might be determined by the original positions divided by two.\n\nFor example, in the first row of the input (row0), the elements are at even positions (0,2,4,6) might be taken. But row0's elements are [2,1,0,0,0,0,1,3]. Even indices are 0:2, 2:0,4:0,6:1. But the output's first row is [0,2,0,0]. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the output is formed by taking the first and last elements of each non-1 row and then arranging them in a certain way. For example, example0's non-1 rows are0,2,3,4,5,7. Their first and last elements are:\n\nRow0:2,3\n\nRow2:0,0\n\nRow3:0,0\n\nRow4:0,0\n\nRow5:0,0\n\nRow7:4,6\n\nThese would be (2,3), (0,0), (0,0), (0,0), (0,0), (4,6). How to form a 4x4 output from this? Maybe taking the first and last of the first and last non-1 rows: 2,3,4,6. Then, for the middle rows, sum the 8s.\n\nBut this doesn't explain the middle output rows.\n\nAt this point, I think the pattern must involve dividing the input into 2x2 blocks, processing them to sum the 8s (divided by 4), and also including the first and last elements of the first and last rows.\n\nBut I'm not entirely sure. For the test input, let's try applying this approach.\n\nTest Input:\n\n[3, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 4]\n\n[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]\n\n[0, 1, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0]\n\n[0, 1, 8, 8, 8, 0, 8, 0, 1, 0]\n\n[0, 1, 0, 0, 8, 0, 8, 0, 1, 0]\n\n[0, 1, 0, 8, 0, 8, 8, 0, 1, 0]\n\n[0, 1, 8, 8, 0, 8, 0, 8, 1, 0]\n\n[0, 1, 0, 8, 0, 0, 8, 0, 1, 0]\n\n[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]\n\n[7, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 5]\n\nThe output should be a 5x4 grid? No, the examples have outputs that are smaller than the input. Let's see the input has 10 rows. The all-1 rows are row1 and row8. So non-1 rows are row0,2,3,4,5,6,7,9.\n\nAssuming each pair of non-1 rows forms an output row. Since there are 8 non-1 rows, divided into 4 pairs, leading to 4 output rows. Each output row would be formed by processing each pair of non-1 rows.\n\nFor each pair of rows, process 2x2 blocks, but since each row has 10 elements, maybe the columns are grouped into pairs. So each output row would have 5 elements (since 10/2=5). But the examples show that example0's 8 elements become 4, so 8/2=4. Similarly, the test input's rows have 10 elements, so output rows would have 5 elements.\n\nBut let's look at the examples. Example0's input rows have 8 elements, output rows have4. So each output element corresponds to a 2x2 block. So for the test input's 10-element rows, each output row would have 5 elements, each from a 2x2 block. But the test input has 10 rows, but after removing all-1 rows (rows1 and8), there are 8 rows (0,2,3,4,5,6,7,9). Pairing them into 4 pairs: (0,2), (3,4), (5,6), (7,9). Each pair forms an output row.\n\nFor each pair of rows, process each 2x2 column block to compute the sum of 8s divided by4.\n\nLet's take the first pair: row0 and row2.\n\nRow0: [3,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,4]\n\nRow2: [0,1,0,8,8,0,0,0,1,0]\n\nProcessing columns in pairs. For each pair of columns (0-1, 2-3, etc.):\n\nColumns0-1:\n\nRow0:3,1\n\nRow2:0,1\n\nSum of 8s:0 \u2192 0/4=0.\n\nColumns2-3:\n\nRow0:0,0\n\nRow2:0,8\n\nSum of 8s:8 \u2192 8/4=2.\n\nColumns4-5:\n\nRow0:0,0\n\nRow2:8,0\n\nSum of 8s:8 \u2192 8/4=2.\n\nColumns6-7:\n\nRow0:0,0\n\nRow2:0,0\n\nSum of 8s:0 \u2192 0.\n\nColumns8-9:\n\nRow0:1,4\n\nRow2:1,0\n\nSum of 8s:0 \u21920.\n\nSo the first output row would be [0,2,2,0,0].\n\nBut the examples show that the output rows are shorter. Wait, example0's input has 8 columns, output rows 4 elements. So each 2x2 block (2 rows and 2 columns). So for the test input's 10 columns, each pair of rows would process 10/2=5 blocks, leading to 5 elements per output row. But the examples have outputs with varying sizes. For example, example1's input is6x6, output2x2. 6/3=2. So maybe the column pairs are processed differently.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is formed by taking the first and last elements of the first and last rows, and the middle elements from the sum of 8s in the middle rows.\n\nFor the test input's first row (row0): [3,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,4]. The first element is3, last is4.\n\nThe last row (row9): [7,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,5]. First element7, last5.\n\nSo the output's first row would include3 and4, last row7 and5. The middle rows would come from processing the 8s in rows2-7.\n\nBut how?\n\nAlternatively, the output is structured as follows:\n\n- The first output row is the first and last elements of the first non-1 row (row0:3 and4).\n\n- The last output row is the first and last elements of the last non-1 row (row9:7 and5).\n\n- The middle output rows are derived from processing pairs of non-1 rows (rows2-3,4-5,6-7) by summing 8s in 2x2 blocks.\n\nBut how many middle output rows would there be? For 8 non-1 rows (0,2,3,4,5,6,7,9), excluding first and last, there are 6 middle rows. Pairing into3 pairs, giving3 output rows. So total output rows would be first row (3,4), 3 middle rows, last row (7,5), totaling5 rows. But the examples have varying output sizes, so this might not hold.\n\nThis is getting too time-consuming. Given that I need to provide an answer, I'll proceed with the hypothesis that each output element is the sum of 8s in a 2x2 block divided by4, and the first and last elements of the first and last rows are included in the output.\n\nApplying this to the test input.\n\nFirst, identify the all-1 rows. In the test input, rows1 and8 are all-1s. So the non-1 rows are0,2,3,4,5,6,7,9.\n\nPair them into four pairs: (0 and2), (3 and4), (5 and6), (7 and9).\n\nFor each pair, process each 2x2 block (columns in pairs):\n\nPair0: rows0 and2.\n\nRow0:3,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,4\n\nRow2:0,1,0,8,8,0,0,0,1,0\n\nProcessing columns in pairs (0-1, 2-3, 4-5, 6-7, 8-9):\n\nBlock0-1:\n\n3 1\n\n0 1 \u2192 sum of 8s:0 \u2192 0.\n\nBlock2-3:\n\n0 0\n\n0 8 \u2192 sum of 8s:8 \u2192 8/4=2.\n\nBlock4-5:\n\n0 0\n\n8 0 \u2192 sum of 8s:8 \u2192 8/4=2.\n\nBlock6-7:\n\n0 0\n\n0 0 \u2192 sum 0 \u21920.\n\nBlock8-9:\n\n1 4\n\n1 0 \u2192 sum 0 \u21920.\n\nSo output row0 would be [0,2,2,0,0].\n\nPair1: rows3 and4.\n\nRow3:0,1,8,8,8,0,8,0,1,0\n\nRow4:0,1,0,0,8,0,8,0,1,0\n\nBlocks:\n\nBlock0-1:\n\n0 1\n\n0 1 \u2192 sum 0 \u21920.\n\nBlock2-3:\n\n8 8\n\n0 0 \u2192 sum 8+8=16 \u219216/4=4.\n\nBlock4-5:\n\n8 0\n\n8 0 \u2192 sum 8+8=16 \u21924.\n\nBlock6-7:\n\n8 0\n\n8 0 \u2192 sum 8+8=16 \u21924.\n\nBlock8-9:\n\n1 0\n\n1 0 \u2192 sum 0 \u21920.\n\nOutput row1: [0,4,4,4,0].\n\nPair2: rows5 and6.\n\nRow5:0,1,0,8,0,8,8,0,1,0\n\nRow6:0,1,8,8,0,8,0,8,1,0\n\nBlocks:\n\nBlock0-1:0 and1 \u2192 sum 0 \u21920.\n\nBlock2-3:0 and8 in row5,8 and8 in row6 \u2192 sum 8+8+8=24 \u219224/4=6.\n\nBlock4-5:0 and8 in row5,0 and8 in row6 \u2192 sum 8+8=16 \u21924.\n\nBlock6-7:8 and0 in row5,0 and8 in row6 \u2192 sum 8+8=16 \u21924.\n\nBlock8-9:1 and0 \u2192 sum 0 \u21920.\n\nOutput row2: [0,6,4,4,0].\n\nPair3: rows7 and9.\n\nRow7:0,1,0,8,0,0,8,0,1,0\n\nRow9:7,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,5\n\nBlocks:\n\nBlock0-1:0 and1 \u2192 sum 0 \u21920.\n\nBlock2-3:0 and8 \u2192 sum 8 \u21928/4=2.\n\nBlock4-5:0 and0 \u2192 sum 0 \u21920.\n\nBlock6-7:8 and0 \u2192 sum 8 \u21922.\n\nBlock8-9:1 and5 \u2192 sum 0 \u21920.\n\nOutput row3: [0,2,0,2,0].\n\nAdditionally, we need to include the first and last elements of the first and last non-1 rows. The first non-1 row is row0:3 and4. The last non-1 row is row9:7 and5. So maybe the first and last output rows are:\n\n[3, ...,4]\n\n[7, ...,5]\n\nBut according to our previous processing, the first output row is [0,2,2,0,0]. This suggests that the initial hypothesis is incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is formed by the sum of 8s in the middle rows and the first and last elements of the first and last rows.\n\nBut given the time constraints, I'll proceed with the assumption that the output is formed by processing pairs of non-1 rows as 2x2 blocks and sum 8s/4.\n\nFor the test input, the output would be four rows of five elements each:\n\nRow0: [0,2,2,0,0]\n\nRow1: [0,4,4,4,0]\n\nRow2: [0,6,4,4,0]\n\nRow3: [0,2,0,2,0]\n\nBut looking at the examples, the output rows have varying lengths, but they seem to be even. For example, example0's output has four elements per row. The test input has ten columns, leading to five elements per row. However, the examples show that the output rows may not match this. For instance, example1's input is6 columns, output is2 elements per row, which is6/3=2. So perhaps the test input's output would have5 elements per row.\n\nBut the examples don't provide a clear pattern for varying input sizes. Given the time, I'll format the output based on the processing I did, but adjust according to the examples.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output for the test input should be:\n\n[3,4]\n\n[0,2,2,0,0]\n\n[0,4,4,4,0]\n\n[0,6,4,4,0]\n\n[7,5]\n\nBut this is a guess.\n\nHowever, looking at the training examples:\n\nExample0's output has the first row [0,2,0,0], which includes the 2 from the first row of input. The last row [4,0,6,6] includes 4 and6 from the last input row.\n\nExample1's output has [9,4] and [2,0], which are the first and last of the first and last rows.\n\nExample2's output has [0,6,0,2] and [7,0,4,4], which include 6 and2 from the first row,7 and4 from the last row.\n\nSo perhaps the output is formed by:\n\n- The first and last elements of the first and last non-1 rows.\n\n- For the middle output rows, the sum of 8s in 2x2 blocks.\n\nBut how to merge these.\n\nAlternatively, the output is a combination of the first and last elements of the first and last non-1 rows and the processed 8s from the middle rows.\n\nGiven the time, I'll proceed to format the test input's output as follows, based on the processing of 2x2 blocks and including the first and last elements of the first and last rows:\n\nFirst output row: [3, 0, 0, 0, 4]\n\nSecond output row: [0, 2, 2, 0, 0]\n\nThird output row: [0, 4, 4, 4, 0]\n\nFourth output row: [0, 6, 4, 4, 0]\n\nFifth output row: [7, 2, 0, 2, 5]\n\nBut this doesn't match the examples' structure. Alternatively, the output might be structured into pairs of rows and columns, leading to a 4x5 grid, but the examples show varying outputs.\n\nGiven the time I'm taking and the need to provide an answer, I'll make an educated guess based on the examples:\n\nThe output for the test input would likely be:\n\n[3,4]\n\n[0,2,2,0,0]\n\n[0,4,4,4,0]\n\n[0,6,4,4,0]\n\n[7,5]\n\nBut the examples show that the output has rows of varying lengths. However, example0's output is four rows of four elements each. The test input's non-1 rows are8, which when paired into four pairs would lead to four output rows of five elements each. But the examples show that the output dimensions are half the input's dimensions.\n\nBut since the test input is10x10, the output would be5x5. But the examples' output sizes are inconsistent. So perhaps the answer is:\n\n[3, 4]\n\n[0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n[4, 4, 4, 0]\n\n[6, 4, 4, 0]\n\n[7, 5]\n\nBut this is a rough guess. Given the time, I'll proceed to format the answer as per the training examples, but I'm not confident.",

        "cot_2": "Okay, let's see. I need to figure out the pattern that transforms the input lists into the output lists in the training examples. Then apply that pattern to the test input. Let's start by looking at the examples closely.\n\nFirst, let's look at Example 0. The input is an 8x8 grid (since there are 8 lists each with 8 elements). The output is a 4x4 grid. Similarly, Example 1's input is 6x6, and the output is 2x2. Example 2's input is 8x8 again, output 4x4. So the output size seems to be half the input size. For instance, 8x8 becomes 4x4, 6x6 becomes 2x2 (wait, 6 divided by 2 is 3, but example 1's output is 2x2. Hmm, maybe not exactly half. Wait, example 1's input is 6 rows, output is 2 rows. So 6 divided by 3 gives 2? Or maybe there's another pattern. Let me check again.\n\nWait, in Example 1, the input has 6 rows. The output is 2 rows. So maybe the output is (n-2)/2 rows? For 6 rows: (6-2)/2 = 2. For 8 rows: (8-2)/2=3, but example 0's output has 4 rows. Wait, that doesn't fit. Maybe the output is (input rows -2) / 2. Let's see:\n\nExample 0: 8 rows input. (8-2)/2 = 3. But output has 4 rows. That doesn't match. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the output is every other row, starting from the first and last?\n\nWait, looking at the structure of the inputs. In all examples, the first and last rows are like borders. For example, in Example 0's input, the first row is [2,1,0,0,0,0,1,3], the second is all 1s, then some rows with 1s in the second position perhaps, and the last row is [4,1,0,...6]. The outputs seem to be formed by combining elements from the first and last rows and some other rows.\n\nLooking at Example 0's output:\n\nOutput rows are [0,2,0,0], [2,2,0,3], [0,0,6,0], [4,0,6,6].\n\nWait, the first output row might come from the first input row. Let's see:\n\nInput first row is [2,1,0,0,0,0,1,3]. The output first row is [0,2,0,0]. Hmm, where do these numbers come from?\n\nWait, maybe the output is constructed by taking elements from the first and last rows, but modified in some way. Let's check the first output row of example 0: [0,2,0,0]. The first input row starts with 2. The output's second element is 2. Maybe it's combining the first and last elements of certain positions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by looking at pairs of rows and columns. For instance, each output cell is derived from a 2x2 block in the input. But let's check.\n\nIn example 0, the input is 8x8. The output is 4x4. So each output cell corresponds to a 2x2 block in the input. Let's see:\n\nTake the first two rows of the input. The first output row is [0,2,0,0]. Let's take the first two elements of the first two rows:\n\nFirst input row starts with 2,1,0,0,...\n\nSecond input row is all 1s.\n\nSo maybe 2 and 1 from the first two rows. But how does that become 0? Not sure. Alternatively, maybe each output cell is the sum of a 2x2 block. For example, in example 0's first output element 0: perhaps the sum of 2,1,1,1 (from the first two rows and first two columns) would be 5. That doesn't match. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is formed by taking elements from the first and last rows, but skipping the borders (the 1s). Let's look.\n\nIn example 0's input, first row is [2,1,0,0,0,0,1,3]. The output's first row is [0,2,0,0]. The elements 2 and 3 are the first and last elements of the first input row. But the output's first element is 0. Wait, maybe the output is combining elements from the first and last rows, but not directly. Let's see:\n\nLooking at example 0's output rows:\n\nFirst output row: [0, 2, 0, 0]\n\nLooking at the first input row: [2,1,0,0,0,0,1,3]\n\nAnd the last input row: [4,1,0,0,0,0,1,6]\n\nSo maybe each output row is formed by combining elements from the first and last input rows. For example, the first element of the output could be first element of first input row minus some value, but that's not clear.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is taking the corners of the input grid. For example, the first and last elements of the first and last rows.\n\nIn example 0's first input row: first element is 2, last is 3. Last input row's first is 4, last is 6. So maybe the output's first row is 2,3 and 4,6? But the output's first row is [0,2,0,0]. Hmm, not matching.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is created by looking at certain positions in the input, but only considering the non-1 and non-8 elements. Let's look at example 0's input rows. The second row is all 1s, which might be borders. The inner rows have 0s and 8s. The outputs might be combining numbers from the first and last rows, and the inner 8s are being summed or counted in some way.\n\nLooking at the output of example 0: the third row is [0,0,6,0]. The 6 might come from the last input row's 6. But how?\n\nWait, perhaps the output is constructed by taking elements from the corners of the input and the number of 8s in certain regions. Let me think.\n\nLooking at example 0's input. The first input row has 2 and 3. The last row has 4 and 6. The output has 0,2,0,0 in the first row. Then the second row of the output has 2,2,0,3. The 3 could be from the first row's last element (3). The 2 could be from the first element of the first row (2). The 0s might be something else.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is built by combining the first and last elements of the first and last rows, and the count of 8s in certain quadrants. For example, in example 0, the third output row is [0,0,6,0], maybe the 6 comes from the last element of the last input row (6) but how?\n\nAlternatively, looking at the 8s in the input. Let's check how many 8s are in the input of example 0. The third row has an 8, the fourth row has two 8s, fifth has one, sixth has two. So total of 8s maybe? But the output's third row has a 6. Not sure.\n\nWait, example 0's output is four rows. The third row has a 6. The last row of the input is [4,1,0,0,0,0,1,6]. The 4 and 6 are the first and last elements. The output's last row is [4,0,6,6]. So maybe 4 is the first element, and 6 is the last, but then there are two 6s. So perhaps combining the first and last elements of the first and last rows, and the counts of 8s in certain areas.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is built by taking the first and last elements of the first and last rows, and then for the middle elements, count the number of 8s in the corresponding columns or rows.\n\nWait, let's take example 0's input:\n\nThe first and last rows are:\n\n[2,1,0,0,0,0,1,3]\n\n[4,1,0,0,0,0,1,6]\n\nSo their first elements are 2 and 4, last are 3 and 6.\n\nIn the output, the first row is [0,2,0,0]. The second row is [2,2,0,3]. The third [0,0,6,0]. Fourth [4,0,6,6].\n\nHmm, the 2 and 4 appear in the outputs. The 3 and 6 as well. Maybe each output row combines elements from the first and last input rows, but arranged in a specific way. For example, the first row of the output may take elements from the first row of the input, and the last row of the input.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is a combination of the first and last rows and the number of 8s in each quadrant. Let's see.\n\nIn example 0, the input has 8s in rows 3,4,5,6. For example, row 3: [0,1,0,8,0,0,1,0]. So 8 is at position 3. Row 4: [0,1,8,8,0,8,1,0]. So positions 2,3,5. Row 5: [0,1,0,0,8,0,1,0]. Position 4. Row 6: [0,1,8,0,8,8,1,0]. Positions 2,4,5.\n\nSo the total number of 8s in these rows? Let's count each row:\n\nRow 3: 1\n\nRow4:3\n\nRow5:1\n\nRow6:3\n\nTotal 8s: 1+3+1+3=8. But example 0's output has a 6 in the third row, maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each output cell corresponds to a 2x2 block in the input, and the value is the sum of non-0 and non-1 numbers in that block. Let's check.\n\nTake example 0's first output row: [0,2,0,0]. Let's look at the first 2x2 block of the input (rows 1-2, columns 1-2):\n\nInput rows 1: [2,1,0,0,0,0,1,3]\n\nRow1: elements 2 (index 0?), then 1. Then 0,0, etc.\n\nWait, maybe the input is considered as rows and columns, and each output cell is formed from a 2x2 block. For example, the first 2x2 block of the input (top-left) would be 2, 1, 1, 1 (from first two elements of first and second rows). Then sum those numbers, but 2+1+1+1=5. The output's first element is 0. That doesn't match. So maybe not sum.\n\nAlternatively, the output could be the count of 8s in each 2x2 block. Let's check example 0. The input rows 3-4 (third and fourth rows) have some 8s. Let's take the third row: [0,1,0,8,0,0,1,0]. The fourth row: [0,1,8,8,0,8,1,0]. So the first two columns in rows 3-4 would be 0,1 (row3) and 0,1 (row4), no 8s. The next 2 columns (columns 3-4 in rows 3-4) have 8 and 8 (row3, column3 is 8, row4 column2 is 8, etc. Maybe not. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking elements from the corners of the input. For example, in example 0's output:\n\nFirst output row is [0,2,0,0]. The 2 could be the second element of the first input row. Then in the second output row, [2,2,0,3], the 2 and 3 are from the first input row's first and last elements. Not sure.\n\nAnother approach: looking for the numbers in the output and seeing where they appear in the input.\n\nIn example 0's output:\n\n[0,2,0,0] \u2192 2 is present in the first input row's first element.\n\nThe second output row [2,2,0,3] has 2 and 3. 3 is the last element of the first input row.\n\nThird output row [0,0,6,0] \u2192 6 is the last element of the last input row.\n\nFourth output row [4,0,6,6] \u2192 4 is the first element of the last input row, and 6 again.\n\nSo maybe each output row is combining elements from the first and last input rows, and some counts of 8s in between.\n\nLooking at the output rows:\n\n- The first output row seems to take elements from the first input row (2 and 3) but they are in positions 1 and 3 here. But in the first output row, 2 is in position 1, and the rest are zeros. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is constructed by taking the first and last elements of the first and last rows, and then in between, the number of 8s in each quadrant.\n\nWait, in example 0's input, the first row starts with 2 and ends with 3, the last row starts with 4 and ends with 6. The output has:\n\nRow 0: 0, 2, 0, 0 \u2192 maybe the 2 is from the first row's first element (2) but why zero?\n\nRow 1: 2, 2, 0, 3 \u2192 2 and 3 from first row, 2 and something.\n\nRow 2: 0,0,6,0 \u2192 6 from last row's end.\n\nRow3:4,0,6,6 \u2192 4 and 6 from last row.\n\nSo maybe the output rows 0 and 3 are from the first and last input rows, and rows 1 and 2 are from middle rows. But how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is formed by taking pairs of rows from the input, starting from the first and last, and working inward.\n\nFor example, in example 0's input, there are 8 rows. The output is 4 rows. So each output row is a combination of two input rows: first and last, then second and seventh, third and sixth, fourth and fifth.\n\nLet me check example 0's output.\n\nTake the first input row (row 0) and last input row (row7):\n\nInput row0: [2,1,0,0,0,0,1,3]\n\nRow7: [4,1,0,0,0,0,1,6]\n\nThe output's first row is [0,2,0,0]. How does that come from these two rows?\n\nIf we take elements from these two rows, maybe taking certain positions. For example, take the first element of row0 (2) and the last element of row7 (6). But the output's first element is 0. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, subtract elements. Row0's first element is 2, row7's first is4. 4-2=2. But output first element is 0. Doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each output element is formed by combining elements from the same column in the paired input rows. For example, in output row 0, column 0 could be row0's element0 (2) and row7's element0 (4). How? Maybe sum them? 2+4=6. But output is 0. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the difference between the first and last rows. For example, 4-2=2, but that's in the output's second element of the first row. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is built by looking at the numbers that are not 1 or 8 in the input. For example, the numbers 2,3,4,6 in example 0. The output has 2,3,4,6. Maybe these are placed in certain positions based on their occurrence in the input.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is a transformed version of the input where certain rows are merged. For instance, in example 0, the input's first row has 2 and 3, and the output's first row has 0,2,0,0. Maybe the 2 is from the first input row, but the 0s could be indicating the absence of other numbers. Not sure.\n\nLet me look at another example. Example 1:\n\nInput has 6 rows. The output is 2 rows. The input's first row is [9,1,0,0,1,4], last row [2,1,0,0,1,3]. The output's first row is [9,4], second [2,0]. So the 9 is the first element of the first input row, 4 is the last element of the first input row. 2 is the first element of the last input row, 0 is perhaps from the last element of the last input row (3?), but 3 isn't in the output. Hmm, that doesn't fit. Wait, the output's second row is [2,0]. The last input row's first element is 2 and last is 3. Maybe 3 is not included. So why 0?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output takes the first and last elements of the first and last input rows. So for example 1:\n\nFirst output row: first input row's first (9) and last (4) elements. Second output row: last input row's first (2) and last (3) elements. But the output's second row is [2,0], not [2,3]. So that's not matching.\n\nWait, but in example 1's input, the last element of the last row is 3, but the output's second row is [2,0]. So maybe there's another pattern.\n\nLooking back at example 1's input:\n\nInput rows:\n\nRow0: [9,1,0,0,1,4]\n\nRow1: [1,1,1,1,1,1]\n\nRow2: [0,1,8,8,1,0]\n\nRow3: [0,1,8,0,1,0]\n\nRow4: [1,1,1,1,1,1]\n\nRow5: [2,1,0,0,1,3]\n\nThe output is two rows: [9,4], [2,0]. \n\nLooking at the output rows, 9 and 4 are the first and last elements of the first input row. 2 is the first element of the last input row. The 0 might be the last element of the last input row's previous element. But the last element is 3, so that doesn't fit. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the 0 in the output is from the count of 8s in the input. For example, in example 1's input, rows 2 and 3 have 8s. Let's count the number of 8s. Row2 has two 8s, row3 has one. Total 3. But the output's second row ends with 0. Not matching.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output's second element in the second row is the count of 8s in the last input row. The last input row is [2,1,0,0,1,3], which has no 8s, so count is 0. Hence the 0. Then the first element of the second output row is the first element of the last input row (2). That would explain the [2,0]. So in example 1's output, the first row is first and last of the first input row, and the second row is first of last input row and count of 8s in the input.\n\nBut how does that fit with example 0?\n\nIn example 0's input, the number of 8s is (from earlier count) 1+3+1+3=8. But example 0's output has a 6. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output's elements are the non-1 and non-8 numbers from the first and last rows, and the counts of 8s in certain regions.\n\nWait, example 1's first input row is [9,1,0,0,1,4]. The non-1 and non-8 numbers are 9,0,0,4. But the output's first row is [9,4], which are the first and last elements here. Then the last input row is [2,1,0,0,1,3]. Non-1 and non-8 are 2,0,0,3. Output's second row is [2,0]. So perhaps taking the first and second non-1, non-8 elements. But not sure.\n\nAnother thought: the outputs seem to have numbers that are present in the first and last rows of the input. For example, in example 0, the output's first row has 2 (from first row's first element), the second row has 3 (from first row's last element), third row has 6 (last row's last element), and fourth row has 4 (last row's first element). So maybe each output row is formed from a pair of input rows, taking first and last elements and combining them in some way.\n\nLooking at example 0's output:\n\nRow0: [0,2,0,0] \u2192 perhaps the 2 is from the first input row's first element.\n\nRow1: [2,2,0,3] \u2192 2 and 3.\n\nRow2: [0,0,6,0] \u2192 6.\n\nRow3: [4,0,6,6] \u2192 4 and 6.\n\nSo maybe each output row is formed from two input rows: the first and last, then the second and second-last, etc. And each output row combines elements from these pairs.\n\nFor example, in example 0's input:\n\nRows 0 and 7 \u2192 output row 0 and 3?\n\nBut how?\n\nAlternatively, output row 0 combines elements from input row 0 and 7. So the first element of output row 0 is 0 (maybe sum or difference of elements from these rows). Let's see:\n\nInput row0: [2,1,0,0,0,0,1,3]\n\nRow7: [4,1,0,0,0,0,1,6]\n\nIf we take (row0[0], row7[0]) \u2192 2 and 4. Output row0 first element is 0. Maybe 4 -2 =2. But output is 0. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output elements are the sum of elements from the first and last rows in each column. For example, column0: 2+4=6, but output row0, column0 is 0. Doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, the output is the difference between the first and last row elements. 2-4= -2, but output is 0. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is taking elements from the first row where they are not 1 or 0, and from the last row similarly.\n\nIn example 0's first row, non-1 and non-0 elements are 2 and 3. Last row has 4 and 6. The output rows have 2,3,4,6. But they are arranged in a particular way.\n\nLooking at example 0's output:\n\n[0,2,0,0]\n\n[2,2,0,3]\n\n[0,0,6,0]\n\n[4,0,6,6]\n\nThe 2 appears in the first and second rows. The 3 in the second. 4 and 6 in the fourth. And 6 appears in third and fourth rows.\n\nThis looks like the numbers 2,3,4,6 are placed in the output in specific positions, possibly their original positions in the input. For example, 2 is the first element of the first input row, so maybe placed in the first row, second column of the output. 3 is the last element of the first input row, placed in the fourth column of the second output row. 4 is the first element of the last input row, placed in the first column of the fourth output row. 6 is the last element of the last input row, placed in the third and fourth columns of the fourth output row.\n\nBut how to explain the 0s? Maybe the other elements are zeros unless they are adjacent to these numbers in the input.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is constructed by taking the corners of the input grid and then counting the 8s in each quadrant.\n\nIn example 0's input:\n\nThe corners are 2 (top-left), 3 (top-right), 4 (bottom-left), 6 (bottom-right). These appear in the output. The 8s are present in the inner rows (rows 2-6, excluding the first and last which are all 1s). Maybe each quadrant's 8 count is part of the output.\n\nFor example, splitting the input into four quadrants. For an 8x8 grid, each quadrant is 4x4. The 8s in each quadrant are counted. Then, the output is formed by combining the corner elements and the counts.\n\nBut example 0's output has numbers like 2, 3, 4,6, and also 0s. The counts of 8s in quadrants could be the numbers in between. Let's check.\n\nIn example 0's input, the 8s are in rows 2,3,4,5,6 (rows are zero-based?), let's see:\n\nRow2: [0,1,0,8,0,0,1,0]. So columns 3 has an 8.\n\nRow3: [0,1,8,8,0,8,1,0]. Columns 2,3,5.\n\nRow4: [0,1,0,0,8,0,1,0]. Column4.\n\nRow5: [0,1,8,0,8,8,1,0]. Columns2,4,5.\n\nRow6: [0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0]. No 8s.\n\nSo quadrant 1 (top-left) would be rows 0-3, columns 0-3. Wait, but the first two rows are all 1s, so maybe the quadrants are divided differently.\n\nAlternatively, the input's 8s are in the middle rows. Maybe each quadrant is split into top-left, top-right, bottom-left, bottom-right. For example, for rows 2-5 and columns 2-5 (assuming even size), the 8s in each quadrant are counted.\n\nIn example 0's input:\n\nTop-left quadrant of the middle rows (rows 2-5, columns 2-5):\n\nRow2: columns2-5: 0,8,0,0 \u2192 one 8.\n\nRow3: columns2-5:8,8,0,8 \u2192 three 8s.\n\nRow4: columns2-5:0,0,8,0 \u2192 one 8.\n\nRow5: columns2-5:8,0,8,8 \u2192 three 8s.\n\nTotal in top-left quadrant (columns2-5, rows2-5): 1+3+1+3=8 8s. But example 0's output has a 6. So maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 8s are counted in the entire input except the borders (rows with all 1s). The total number of 8s in example0's input is 1 (row2) +3 (row3) +1 (row4) +3 (row5) = 8. But example0's output has 6 in some cells. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, the output numbers like 6 could be the sum of certain elements. For example, 2+4=6. 3+3=6. In example0's output, the third row has 6. The first input row's last element is 3, last input row's last is6. 3+3=6? Not sure.\n\nAnother angle: looking at the output structure. The output in example0 is four rows, each with four elements. The first and last rows of the output have two non-zero elements, and the middle rows have one or two.\n\nExample0's output:\n\n[0,2,0,0]\n\n[2,2,0,3]\n\n[0,0,6,0]\n\n[4,0,6,6]\n\nSo 2 appears in the first and second rows. 3 in the second. 4 and 6 in the fourth. 6 also in the third.\n\nThis suggests that the output is built using the first and last elements of the first and last input rows, and the 8s are being summed or counted in some way. For example, the number of 8s in the input could be related to the 6 in the output.\n\nWait, example0's input has 8 8s. But the output has a 6. So maybe it's not a direct count.\n\nAlternatively, the 6 in example0's output could be from the last element of the last input row (6), and the 4 is from the first element of the last input row (4). The 2 and 3 are from the first input row. The middle rows' numbers (like 2 in the second row) might come from the first input row's elements again. \n\nThis suggests that the output is a combination of the first and last rows' elements, arranged in a specific pattern, possibly with some transformation. But how?\n\nLooking at example0's output:\n\nThe first output row's elements are 0,2,0,0. The 2 is in the second position. The first input row's first element is 2, so maybe it's placed in the second position. The third output row has 6 in the third position; the last input row's last element is 6. So perhaps the positions are mirrored or shifted.\n\nAlternatively, the output's elements are arranged in a diamond shape. For example, 2 is in position (0,1), 3 in (1,3), 4 in (3,0), and 6 in (2,2), (3,2), (3,3). But how to derive that.\n\nAnother idea: the output is a compressed version of the input where:\n\n- The first and last rows of the output correspond to the first and last rows of the input, but taking every other element and excluding the 1s and 0s.\n\nBut example0's first input row has [2,1,0,0,0,0,1,3]. The non-1 and non-0 elements are 2 and 3. The first output row is [0,2,0,0]. So 2 is in the second position. The last input row has 4 and 6. The last output row has 4 in the first position and 6 in the third and fourth.\n\nAlternatively, the output is constructed by placing the non-1 and non-0 elements from the first and last input rows into certain positions, and the 8s from the middle rows are summed or counted and placed in the middle of the output.\n\nFor example, in example0's input, the non-1 and non-0 elements in the first row are 2 and 3, placed in the output's first and second rows. The 8s are counted and their total (8) is somehow represented as 6 in the output. But why 6?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each 8 in the input contributes a certain value to the output. For example, each 8 adds 1, but then example0 has 8 8s, which would give 8, but the output has 6. So maybe not.\n\nAnother angle: the output seems to have elements that are the sum of certain pairs. For example, in example0's output row 3: [4,0,6,6]. 4+0=4, 6+6=12. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the positions of the numbers in the output:\n\nIn example0:\n\n- 2 appears in positions (0,1), (1,0), (1,1)\n\n- 3 in (1,3)\n\n- 4 in (3,0)\n\n- 6 in (2,2), (3,2), (3,3)\n\nSo perhaps these numbers are arranged in a way that their positions correspond to the input's positions. For example, 2 is the first element of the first input row. Its position in the output is (0,1). Maybe the output rows and columns are mirrored or scaled.\n\nAlternatively, the output is a rotated or transformed version of the input's corners and the counts of 8s.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Let's try to look for a different approach.\n\nIn example0's output, the numbers present are 2,3,4,6. These are the non-1 and non-0 elements from the first and last input rows. The 6 in the output is from the last input row's last element. The 4 is from the last input row's first element. The 2 and 3 are from the first input row's first and last elements.\n\nThe other numbers in the output (like the 2 in the second row) may be derived from the first input row's first element again. The 6 in the third row's third position and the fourth row's third and fourth positions could be from the last input row's last element. \n\nSo perhaps the output is created by taking the non-1 and non-0 elements from the first and last input rows and arranging them in a specific pattern, and then adding the count of 8s in certain regions. But how.\n\nAlternatively, the output is a matrix where each element is the sum of the corresponding elements in the first and last rows of the input. For example, for output element (i,j), it's first_row[i] + last_row[j]. But in example0:\n\nFirst input row: [2,1,0,0,0,0,1,3]\n\nLast input row: [4,1,0,0,0,0,1,6]\n\nIf we take first_row[0] + last_row[0] = 2+4=6. But output row0, column0 is 0. Doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, the output is a combination of the first and last rows' elements in a way that their product or difference is considered. For example, 4-2=2, which is present in the output's first row. 3+3=6, but not sure.\n\nAnother idea: the output is created by taking the first and last elements of each row in the input, excluding the rows with all 1s and the rows with 1s and 0s. But not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the output is formed by pairing the first and last elements of certain rows and columns. For example, the first output row is formed by the first element of the first input row and the last element of the last input row. But example0's first output row is [0,2,0,0], which doesn't align.\n\nAlternatively, the output rows are formed by the first and last elements of the first and last input rows, and the middle elements are the sum of 8s in certain regions.\n\nIn example0's output, the 2 and 3 come from the first input row's first and last elements. The 4 and 6 come from the last input row's first and last. The 6 in the third row may come from summing 8s in a certain area.\n\nLooking at example0's input, the number of 8s in the entire middle rows (rows 2-6) is 8. But the output's third row has a 6. 8 -2=6? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the output's numbers are the original numbers from the first and last rows, and the middle numbers are the count of 8s in the corresponding columns. For example, in example0's output, the third row's third element is 6. If columns 3 in the input have a certain number of 8s. Let's count the number of 8s in each column for example0's input:\n\nColumn0: all zeros except first and last rows (no 8s). So 0.\n\nColumn1: all 1s except in row0 (1), row7 (1). So no 8s.\n\nColumn2: row3 has 8, row5 has 8, row6 has 8. So in rows 3,5,6 (positions 2,4,5). Let's count:\n\nRow2: column2 is 0.\n\nRow3: column2 is8.\n\nRow4: column2 is0.\n\nRow5: column2 is8.\n\nRow6: column2 is0.\n\nSo column2 has 2 8s.\n\nColumn3: row2:8, row3:8, row5:0.\n\nRow2:8\n\nRow3:8\n\nRow4:0\n\nRow5:0\n\nSo column3 has 2 8s.\n\nColumn4: row4:8, row5:8, row6:0.\n\nRow4:8\n\nRow5:8\n\nColumn4 has 2.\n\nColumn5: row3:8, row5:8, row6:8.\n\nRow3:8\n\nRow5:8\n\nRow6:8\n\nSo column5 has 3.\n\nSo columns with 8s are column2 (2), column3 (2), column4 (2), column5 (3).\n\nBut the output's third row has a 6. So maybe the sum of 8s in certain columns. For example, columns 2+3+4+5=2+2+2+3=9. Not 6.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's the number of rows with 8s. For example, in example0, there are 4 rows with 8s (rows3,4,5,6). But output has a 6.\n\nNot matching.\n\nAlternatively, the output numbers are formed by multiplying the first and last elements of the input rows. For example, 2*3=6, which appears in the output. 4*6=24, but there's no 24 in the output. Not helpful.\n\nAnother approach: looking at the test input and trying to apply the same pattern.\n\nTest Input:\n\nIt's a 10x10 grid. The output should be smaller. The training examples show that when input size is even, the output size is (input size / 2) - maybe not. For example, example0's input is 8x8, output is 4x4. Example1's input is 6x6, output is 2x2. Example2's input is 8x8, output is 4x4. So for even n, output size is n/2 rows and columns. For the test input, which is 10 rows, the output should be 5x5? But looking at the training examples, example0 and 2's input is 8x8, output is 4x4. 8/2=4. Example1's input is 6x6, output 2x2. 6/3=2. So maybe the output size is (input rows - 2)/2. For 8 rows: (8-2)/2=3, but output is 4 rows. Doesn't fit. Hmm. Alternatively, the output has (n-2) rows, but that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, in the training examples, the output rows are (input rows - 2)/2. For example0: (8-2)/2=3 rows. But output is 4. So that's not right.\n\nLooking at the examples again:\n\nExample0's input has 8 rows. Output has 4 rows. So 8/2=4.\n\nExample1's input has 6 rows. Output has 2 rows. 6/3=2.\n\nExample2's input has 8 rows. Output has 4 rows.\n\nSo for even-numbered inputs, the output rows are input rows divided by 2. For example, 8/2=4, 6/2=3? Wait, but example1's output is 2 rows. 6 divided by 2 is 3. Hmm, this doesn't fit. So maybe the pattern is different. Alternatively, the output has (input rows - 2)/2 rows. For example0: (8-2)/2=3, but output is 4. Doesn't fit. \n\nAlternatively, the output rows are the first and last rows of the input, and then the middle rows are collapsed. But how.\n\nAlternatively, the output is created by taking every other row from the input, starting from the first and then the last. For example, in example0's input, the output has 4 rows. So first row, then perhaps rows 1, then the last row. But example0's output has 4 rows, which is different from the input's 8.\n\nThis is getting too time-consuming. Let's try to find a pattern in the output elements.\n\nIn example0's output:\n\nThe elements are 2,3,4,6. These are the non-1 and non-0 elements from the first and last input rows.\n\nThe output's first row has 2 in the second position.\n\nThe second row has 2 and 3.\n\nThe third row has 6.\n\nThe fourth row has 4 and 6.\n\nThis suggests that the output is formed by taking these numbers and placing them in a specific order, possibly moving from the first row's first element to the last row's last element, with some pattern.\n\nIn example1's output, the first row is [9,4], which are the first and last elements of the first input row. The second row is [2,0], which is the first element of the last input row and perhaps zero because there are no 8s in certain regions.\n\nIn example2's input, the first and last rows are [6,1,0,0,0,0,1,2] and [7,1,0,0,0,0,1,4]. The output includes 6, 2,7,4. \n\nExample2's output:\n\n[0,6,0,2]\n\n[6,6,2,0]\n\n[7,0,4,4]\n\n[7,7,4,0]\n\nSo the 6 is from the first input row's first element and the last element (2). The 7 and 4 are from the last row's first and last elements. The other numbers (like the 0s and 6s in the second row) might be derived from counting 8s or other elements.\n\nBut how?\n\nAnother observation: in all examples, the first and last rows of the input have non-1 and non-0 elements. These elements appear in the output, often in positions that mirror their original positions.\n\nFor example, in example0, the first input row's first element (2) appears in the output's first row, second column. The last input row's first element (4) appears in the output's last row, first column. The first input row's last element (3) is in the output's second row, fourth column. The last input row's last element (6) appears in the output's third and fourth rows.\n\nSo perhaps the output is constructed by:\n\n1. Taking the non-1 and non-0 elements from the first and last input rows.\n\n2. Arranging them in a way that the first row's elements are placed in the upper part of the output, and the last row's elements are in the lower part.\n\n3. The middle rows of the output are filled with counts of 8s in certain regions of the input.\n\nBut how to determine the exact positions and counts.\n\nAlternatively, the output is a combination of the first and last rows' elements and the number of 8s in each quadrant of the input.\n\nIn example0's input, let's split the input into four quadrants (ignoring the border of 1s):\n\nTop-left quadrant: rows 2-5, columns 2-5.\n\nIn this quadrant, the number of 8s is 8 (as calculated earlier). But example0's output has a 6. So maybe the count is divided by something.\n\nAlternatively, the output's middle rows are sums of 8s in certain sections.\n\nBut without a clear pattern, this is challenging.\n\nAlternatively, let's look at the test input and see if we can find a pattern.\n\nTest input is 10 rows. So the output should be 5 rows? Or according to previous examples, 8 rows input \u2192 4 output. 6 \u21922. So 10 \u21925. But let's check.\n\nTest input's first row: [3,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,4]\n\nLast row: [7,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,5]\n\nThe non-1 and non-0 elements here are 3,4 in the first row and 7,5 in the last. So these might appear in the output.\n\nThe output may have rows that include 3,4,7,5. Also, there are 8s in the middle rows.\n\nFor example, the third input row is [0,1,0,8,8,0,0,0,1,0]. So 8s in columns3 and4.\n\nRow4: [0,1,8,8,8,0,8,0,1,0] \u2192 columns2,3,4,6.\n\nRow5: [0,1,0,0,8,0,8,0,1,0] \u2192 columns4,6.\n\nRow6: [0,1,0,8,0,8,8,0,1,0] \u2192 columns3,5,6.\n\nRow7: [0,1,8,8,0,8,0,8,1,0] \u2192 columns2,3,5,7.\n\nRow8: [0,1,0,8,0,0,8,0,1,0] \u2192 columns3,6.\n\nSo the number of 8s in the input is quite a lot. Let's count them per row:\n\nRow2: 2\n\nRow3:4\n\nRow4:4\n\nRow5:2\n\nRow6:3\n\nRow7:4\n\nRow8:2\n\nTotal 2+4+4+2+3+4+2= 21 8s.\n\nBut how would this translate to the output numbers?\n\nIn the training examples, example0's output has a 6, which may relate to the last element of the last input row. Example1's output has a 0, which may be the count of 8s in the last input row. \n\nAlternatively, for each output row, the first element is the first element of the corresponding input row, and the last element is the last element of the corresponding input row. Then, the middle elements are counts of 8s in certain sections.\n\nBut I'm not making progress. Let's try to hypothesize based on the examples.\n\nIn example0, the output's first row is [0,2,0,0]. The first input row's first element is 2. The output's first row has 2 in the second position. The last element of the first input row is 3, which appears in the output's second row, fourth position. The last input row's first element is 4 (output's fourth row, first position), and last is6 (output's third and fourth rows).\n\nSo perhaps the output is formed by arranging these elements in a specific pattern, such as placing the first row's elements in the upper part and the last row's elements in the lower part, with some mirroring or diagonal placement.\n\nFor example:\n\nOutput's first row: first element of first input row (2) in position 1.\n\nOutput's second row: first element of first input row (2) in position 0 and 1, last element of first input row (3) in position3.\n\nOutput's third row: last element of last input row (6) in position2.\n\nOutput's fourth row: first element of last input row (4) in position0, last element of last input row (6) in positions2 and3.\n\nThis seems possible, but what's the rule?\n\nMaybe the output is structured as follows:\n\n- The first element of the first input row is placed in the output's first row, second position.\n\n- The last element of the first input row is placed in the output's second row, last position.\n\n- The first element of the last input row is placed in the output's last row, first position.\n\n- The last element of the last input row is placed in the output's third row and last row's third and fourth positions.\n\nBut how to generalize this.\n\nAlternatively, the output is built by mirroring the first and last rows' elements and filling the middle with counts of 8s. \n\nIn the test input's case:\n\nFirst row's non-1 and non-0 elements are 3 and4.\n\nLast row's are7 and5.\n\nSo these numbers may appear in the output. The middle elements may be counts of 8s in certain regions.\n\nBut without a clear pattern, it's hard to proceed.\n\nAnother approach: look for the number of output rows and columns. For example, in the test input, there are 10 rows. If the output follows the pattern of example0 and 2 (8 rows \u21924 output rows), then 10 rows would become 5 output rows. But example1's 6 rows became 2. So maybe for even input rows, output rows are input rows divided by 2. So 10/2=5. So output will be 5 rows. Each row has 5 elements. But looking at the training examples:\n\nExample0's output is 4x4 (input 8x8).\n\nExample1's output is 2x2 (input 6x6).\n\nExample2's output is 4x4 (input 8x8).\n\nSo for input size N, output size is N/2.\n\nThus, the test input is 10x10 \u2192 output is 5x5.\n\nSo the test output should have 5 rows, each with 5 elements.\n\nNow, let's try to construct the output for the test input based on the previous examples.\n\nThe first and last input rows are:\n\nFirst row: [3,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,4]\n\nLast row: [7,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,5]\n\nThe non-1 and non-0 elements in the first row are 3 and4. In the last row, 7 and5.\n\nFollowing the pattern from previous examples, the output's first row might have 3 and4, and the last row 7 and5. The middle rows could involve counts of 8s.\n\nLooking at example0's output:\n\nRow0: [0,2,0,0] \u2192 2 from first input row's first element.\n\nRow3: [4,0,6,6] \u21924 from last input row's first element, 6 from last element.\n\nSo for the test input's output, the first row may have 3 and4 in certain positions, and the last row 7 and5.\n\nThe middle rows could have counts of 8s or other values derived from the middle rows of the input.\n\nAlternatively, the output is structured as follows:\n\n- The first element of the first input row is placed in the output's first row, second position.\n\n- The last element of the first input row is placed in the output's second row, last position.\n\n- The first element of the last input row is placed in the output's last row, first position.\n\n- The last element of the last input row is placed in the penultimate row, third position and last row's third and fourth positions.\n\nBut this is speculative.\n\nAlternatively, the output is formed by taking the first and last elements of the first and last input rows and arranging them in a diamond pattern.\n\nIn example0:\n\n2 is at (0,1), 3 at (1,3), 4 at (3,0), 6 at (2,2) and (3,2-3).\n\nFor the test input, perhaps:\n\n3 at (0,1),4 at (0,4),7 at (4,0),5 at (4,4). Then the middle rows would have counts of 8s.\n\nBut how to determine the counts.\n\nAnother idea: the output is built by taking the first and last elements of the first and last input rows and filling the output with these numbers, while the middle elements are the count of 8s in corresponding quadrants.\n\nBut this is becoming too vague.\n\nGiven the time I've spent without clear progress, I'll have to make an educated guess based on the observed patterns.\n\nBased on the training examples, the output seems to include the non-1 and non-0 elements from the first and last input rows, arranged in a certain way. Additionally, numbers in the output may represent the count of 8s in certain regions.\n\nFor the test input:\n\nFirst row's elements:3 and4.\n\nLast row's elements:7 and5.\n\nThe output would likely include these numbers. The middle rows may have counts of 8s in the input's middle rows.\n\nFor example, in the test input's middle rows (rows 2-8), there are 21 8s. But how to distribute them in the output.\n\nAlternatively, each output row corresponds to two input rows (first and last, second and second-last, etc.), and the elements are combinations of non-1 and non-0 elements and 8 counts.\n\nFor the test input, which has 10 rows, the output would be 5 rows. Each output row is derived from two input rows:\n\nRow0: first and last input rows.\n\nRow1: second and ninth rows.\n\nRow2: third and eighth rows.\n\nRow3: fourth and seventh rows.\n\nRow4: fifth and sixth rows.\n\nIn each of these pairs, we take the non-1 and non-0 elements and/or count the 8s.\n\nFor example, the first output row (from first and last input rows) would combine 3 and4 from the first row, and7 and5 from the last row.\n\nBut how to arrange them.\n\nLooking at example0's first output row [0,2,0,0], where the 2 comes from the first row's first element. Maybe in the test input's case, the first output row would be [0,3,0,0,0], but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the output for the test input would be:\n\n[3, 0, 0, 0, 4]\n\n[0, count1, count2, count3, 0]\n\n[0, count4, count5, count6, 0]\n\n[0, count7, count8, count9, 0]\n\n[7, 0, 0, 0, 5]\n\nBut I'm not sure what the counts would be.\n\nAlternatively, the output's first row is [3,4], last row is [7,5], and middle rows are counts of 8s in corresponding sections. But example1's output had two rows for a 6x6 input. So perhaps the test input's output will be 5 rows, with the first and last rows having the non-1 and non-0 elements from the first and last input rows, and the middle rows having counts of 8s.\n\nBut given the time I've spent and the lack of a clear pattern, I'll have to make a best guess based on the examples.\n\nIn example0, the output's first row has the first element of the first input row in the second position. The last element of the first input row in the fourth position of the second output row. The first element of the last input row in the first position of the fourth output row. The last element of the last input row in the third and fourth positions of the third and fourth output rows.\n\nApplying this pattern to the test input:\n\nFirst input row: 3,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,4 \u2192 non-1 and non-0 elements are 3 and4.\n\nLast input row:7,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,5 \u2192 non-1 and non-0 elements are7 and5.\n\nAssuming the output is 5 rows:\n\nRow0: [0,3,0,0,4]\n\nRow1: [3, something, something, something,0]\n\nRow2: [0, something, count of 8s, something,0]\n\nRow3: [something, something, something, something,5]\n\nRow4: [7,0,0,0,5]\n\nBut this is speculative. Alternatively, the output may look like:\n\nRow0: [3,4]\n\nRow1: [0, 0]\n\nRow2: [count of 8s, count]\n\nRow3: [0,0]\n\nRow4: [7,5]\n\nBut example1's output for 6x6 input is 2 rows, suggesting that the output size is input size divided by 3. 6/3=2. 8/2=4. 10/2=5.\n\nSo test input's output should be 5 rows.\n\nLooking at example0's output:\n\nOutput rows are formed by taking the first and last elements of the first and last input rows and placing them in certain positions, possibly along the diagonals or other patterns.\n\nFor example, in example0's output:\n\nRow0: [0,2,0,0] \u2192 2 is first element of first input row.\n\nRow1: [2,2,0,3] \u2192 2 and3.\n\nRow2: [0,0,6,0] \u21926.\n\nRow3: [4,0,6,6] \u21924 and6.\n\nThis seems like the numbers are arranged in a diamond pattern. 2 at (0,1), 3 at (1,3), 6 at (2,2), 4 at (3,0), 6 at (3,2) and (3,3).\n\nFor the test input's output, which is 5x5, the numbers 3,4,7,5 may be arranged in a similar diamond pattern. For example:\n\nRow0: [0,3,0,0,0]\n\nRow1: [3,0,0,0,4]\n\nRow2: [0,0, X,0,0]\n\nRow3: [7,0,0,0,5]\n\nRow4: [0,0,0,7,5]\n\nBut X could be the count of 8s. However, this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, the output is structured such that the numbers from the first and last input rows are placed around the edges, and the center is filled with counts of 8s.\n\nBut without a clear pattern, it's challenging. Given that time is limited, I'll proceed to make an educated guess based on the examples.\n\nLooking at example0's output, the numbers from the first and last input rows are placed in positions that are mirrored. For instance, 2 is in the first row's second position, and 3 is in the second row's last. Similarly, 4 is in the last row's first position, and 6 is in the third and fourth rows.\n\nApplying this to the test input:\n\n- The first input row's elements are3 and4. 3 would be in the first row's second position, and4 in the first row's fourth position.\n\n- The last input row's elements are7 and5.7 would be in the last row's first position, and5 in the last row's fourth position.\n\n- The middle rows would involve counts of 8s. For example, the third row's center position would have the total count of 8s (21), but this may be split into sections.\n\nBut this is speculative.\n\nAlternatively, the output's first and last elements are taken from the first and last input rows' first and last elements. For example:\n\nTest input's first row:3 and4.\n\nLast row:7 and5.\n\nSo the output's first row would have3 and4, and the last row7 and5. Middle rows might have the counts of 8s in the input's middle rows.\n\nBut example1's output for 6x6 input has two rows: [9,4] and [2,0]. The second row's last element is0, which could be the count of 8s in the last input row (which has none).\n\nApplying this to the test input:\n\nFirst output row: [3,5] (from first row's first and last elements:3 and4? Wait, first row's last element is4. So maybe [3,4].\n\nLast output row: [7,5].\n\nMiddle rows would have counts of 8s in the input's middle rows.\n\nBut example0's output includes 6, which is the last input row's last element. So perhaps each output row after the first is built from the next pair of input rows, taking their first and last elements and/or counts of 8s.\n\nGiven the time constraints, I'll proceed to hypothesize that the output is formed by taking the first and last elements of the first and last input rows and arranging them in specific positions, with the middle rows involving counts of 8s. For the test input, this would result in:\n\n[3,4]\n\n[some counts]\n\n[some counts]\n\n[some counts]\n\n[7,5]\n\nBut without more clarity, I'll have to make a best guess. Given the examples, the output might look like:\n\n[3,0,0,0,4]\n\n[0,8s count, ..., 0]\n\n[...]\n\n[7,0,0,0,5]\n\nBut without knowing the exact pattern for the 8s counts, it's hard to determine.\n\nAlternatively, considering the test input's middle rows have multiple 8s, and the output may sum them in certain regions. For example, each quadrant's 8 count. The test input's middle rows (rows2-8) have 21 8s. If divided into quadrants, each quadrant might have a certain count. For example, the top-left quadrant (rows2-5, columns2-5) might have a certain count, and so on.\n\nBut given the time I've spent and the lack of a clear pattern, I'll proceed to provide a possible output based on the structure observed in the training examples. \n\nGiven that the output rows in examples are formed by combining elements from the first and last input rows and the 8s counts, the test output might be:\n\n[3,0,0,0,4]\n\n[0, x, x, x,0]\n\n[0, x,21, x,0]\n\n[0, x, x, x,0]\n\n[7,0,0,0,5]\n\nBut this is purely a guess. Alternatively, considering example0's output, which has the first and last elements arranged in a diamond pattern, the test output might look like:\n\n[0,3,0,0,0]\n\n[3,0,0,0,4]\n\n[0,0,21,0,0]\n\n[7,0,0,0,5]\n\n[0,0,0,7,5]\n\nBut this is also a guess.\n\nGiven the time, I think the best approach is to mimic the structure of the examples. For example, in example0, the output's first row has the first element of the first input row in the second position, and the last element of the first input row in the fourth position. The last output row has the first element of the last input row in the first position and the last element in the third and fourth positions.\n\nApplying this to the test input:\n\nFirst row of input has 3 and4. So first output row might be [0,3,0,0,4].\n\nSecond row could have 3 and4 again, perhaps in the first and last positions.\n\nThird row might focus on the 8s count, but unsure. For example, if there's a count of 21, but it's split into parts.\n\nFourth row could have the first element of the last input row (7) in the first position and the last element (5) in the last positions.\n\nFifth row could have 7 and5 again.\n\nBut this is speculative.\n\nGiven the examples, I think the safest guess is that the output consists of the first and last elements of the first and last input rows, arranged in a diamond-like pattern, with the middle elements possibly being counts of 8s. For the test input, this would result in:\n\n[0,3,0,0,4]\n\n[3,0,0,0,0]\n\n[0,0,21,0,0]\n\n[0,0,0,0,5]\n\n[7,0,0,0,5]\n\nBut this is not following the exact pattern of the training examples, which have more varied placements.\n\nAlternatively, the output for the test input might be:\n\n[3,4]\n\n[7,5]\n\nBut example1's output for 6x6 input is 2 rows, which is 6/3=2. The test input has 10 rows, so 10/2=5 rows. So this approach would not fit.\n\nGiven the time constraints, I'll proceed to provide an answer that follows the pattern of the training examples but adapted for the test input."
