        "cot_1": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. So, we have these input matrices and corresponding output matrices. The inputs are 3x7 arrays, and the outputs are 3x3 arrays. My goal is to find out how each input row transforms into the output rows. Let's look at the examples one by one.\n\nStarting with Example 0. The input rows are:\n\n[1, 0, 0, 5, 0, 1, 0]\n[0, 1, 0, 5, 1, 1, 1]\n[1, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0]\n\nThe output is:\n\n[0, 0, 0]\n[0, 2, 0]\n[0, 0, 0]\n\nHmm. So each output row is of length 3. The middle element of the middle row is 2 here. Let's check if the middle input row has something special. The middle input row has elements [0,1,0,5,1,1,1]. Not sure yet. Maybe the output is determined by some operation on the input rows?\n\nLooking at Example 1's input:\n\n[1, 1, 0, 5, 0, 1, 0]\n[0, 0, 1, 5, 1, 1, 1]\n[1, 1, 0, 5, 0, 1, 0]\n\nOutput is:\n\n[0, 2, 0]\n[0, 0, 2]\n[0, 2, 0]\n\nHere, the output has 2s in the first and third rows' middle positions and the middle row's third position. Maybe the output is related to certain positions in the input rows. Let's look for a pattern.\n\nAnother observation: Each input row has 7 elements. The fourth element is always 5 in the examples. Maybe the 5 is a separator or part of a key. Let's see.\n\nLooking at the outputs, each output cell might correspond to pairs of elements from the input rows. For example, maybe the first three elements and the last three elements of each input row are being processed in some way, ignoring the fourth element (the 5). But how?\n\nLet's take the first input row of Example 0: [1,0,0,5,0,1,0]. Ignoring the 5, split into [1,0,0] and [0,1,0]. Similarly, the output row is [0,0,0]. Hmm. The output row here has all zeros. The middle input row has [0,1,0] and [1,1,1], and the output middle row is [0,2,0]. Wait, maybe it's counting the number of 1s in certain positions?\n\nAlternatively, maybe each output cell is comparing the sum of certain elements from the three input rows. Let me think.\n\nWait, the output is a 3x3 matrix. Maybe each element in the output corresponds to a combination of elements from the three input rows. For example, output[i][j] could be based on the i-th input row's first three elements and the j-th input row's last three elements. But I need to see if that makes sense.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each output cell (i,j) is determined by the i-th input row and the j-th input row's elements. Let's check.\n\nTake Example 0's output. The middle element (1,1) is 2. Let's look at input rows 1 (middle row) and possibly something else. Wait, the output is 3x3, which is the same as the number of input rows. Maybe each output row corresponds to each input row, and each column as well.\n\nWait, perhaps the output is a 3x3 matrix where each cell (i,j) is the sum of the product of corresponding elements from the first three elements of row i and the last three elements of row j. Let me check that.\n\nFor Example 0:\n\nInput rows:\n\nRow0: [1,0,0 | 0,1,0] (split at 5)\nRow1: [0,1,0 | 1,1,1]\nRow2: [1,0,0 | 0,0,0]\n\nLet's compute the dot product of Row0's first three with Row0's last three: (1*0)+(0*1)+(0*0) = 0. But the output[0][0] is 0. Similarly, output[0][1] would be Row0's first three with Row1's last three: 1*1 + 0*1 +0*1=1. But the output[0][1] is 0. That doesn't match.\n\nHmm. Maybe another approach. Let's see what the output numbers represent. The outputs are 0s and 2s. In Example 1's output, there are three 2s. So maybe it's a count of some condition being met.\n\nLooking at Example 1's input:\n\nRow0: [1,1,0 | 0,1,0]\nRow1: [0,0,1 |1,1,1]\nRow2: [1,1,0 |0,1,0]\n\nThe output is:\n\n[0,2,0]\n[0,0,2]\n[0,2,0]\n\nSo in the first row of output, the middle element is 2. Let's see if Row0's first three elements and Row1's last three have a certain relationship. Row0's first three: [1,1,0], Row1's last three: [1,1,1]. If we take the sum of (element-wise AND?), maybe 1&1 +1&1 +0&1 = 1+1+0=2. That would result in 2. Which matches the output[0][1] being 2. Similarly, output[1][2] is 2. Row1's first three [0,0,1], Row2's last three [0,1,0]. The element-wise AND would be 0&0 +0&1 +1&0=0. Wait, that gives 0, but output[1][2] is 2. Hmm, maybe that's not it.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the sum of element-wise products. For output[0][1], Row0's first three [1,1,0] and Row1's last three [1,1,1]. The dot product is 1*1 +1*1 +0*1 = 2. Which matches the 2 in output[0][1]. Similarly, output[1][2]: Row1's first three [0,0,1] and Row2's last three [0,1,0]. Dot product is 0*0 +0*1 +1*0 = 0. But output[1][2] is 2. That doesn't match. So maybe that's not the right approach.\n\nWait, in Example1's output, the middle row has a 2 in the third position. Let's check other possibilities. Maybe the output matrix's cell (i,j) is the sum of the product of the first three elements of row i and the last three elements of row j. Let's test this.\n\nFor Example1:\n\nRow0 first three: [1,1,0], Row0 last three: [0,1,0]. But output[0][0] would be 1*0 +1*1 +0*0 =1. But the actual output[0][0] is 0. So that doesn't fit. Hmm.\n\nWait maybe the output is a 3x3 matrix where each cell (i,j) is the number of positions where the first three elements of row i and the last three elements of row j both have a 1. Let's see.\n\nIn Example0, output[1][1] is 2. Let's check row1's first three [0,1,0] and row1's last three [1,1,1]. Comparing each position: 0&1=0, 1&1=1, 0&1=0. So sum is 1. But output[1][1] is 2. So that doesn't add up.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the sum of the elements in the product of the first three of row i and the last three of row j. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output cell (i,j) is the sum of the XOR of the first three elements of row i and the last three elements of row j. Wait, XOR might not sum to 2. Let me check.\n\nWait in Example0, output[1][1] is 2. Row1's first three [0,1,0], last three [1,1,1]. If we XOR each pair: 0^1=1, 1^1=0, 0^1=1. Sum is 1+0+1=2. That would match. Let's check if this works for other cells.\n\nExample1:\n\nOutput[0][1] is 2. Row0's first three [1,1,0], Row1's last three [1,1,1]. XOR: 1^1=0, 1^1=0, 0^1=1. Sum 0+0+1=1. But output is 2. So that doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. Maybe not XOR. Maybe something else. Let's try sum of (a + b) for each corresponding element in the first three of i and last three of j. So for Example0's output[1][1], row1's first three [0,1,0], row1's last three [1,1,1]. Sum (0+1)+(1+1)+(0+1) =1 +2 +1=4. Not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe count the number of 1s in the concatenation of the first three of i and last three of j. But that would sum to 3+3=6 for all 1s, but outputs are up to 2.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the sum of the first three elements of row i plus the sum of the last three elements of row j. For Example0's output[1][1]: row1's first three sum is 0+1+0=1, row1's last three sum is 1+1+1=3. 1+3=4, but output is 2. Doesn't fit.\n\nWait, maybe the output is the sum of the element-wise multiplication (dot product) between the first three elements of row i and the last three elements of row j. Let's check:\n\nIn Example0, output[1][1] would be the dot product of [0,1,0] (row1's first three) and [1,1,1] (row1's last three). 0*1 +1*1 +0*1 =1. But output[1][1] is 2. So that's not matching.\n\nWait, maybe the sum of the products of the first three elements of row i and the last three elements of row j, but each product is multiplied by 2. Then for Example0's [0,1,0] and [1,1,1], sum is 1, multiplied by 2 gives 2. That matches. Let's check other cells.\n\nIn Example0, output[0][0] would be [1,0,0] and [0,1,0] (from row0's first and last three). Dot product is 1*0 +0*1 +0*0=0. Multiply by 2 is 0. Which matches output[0][0] of 0.\n\nThen output[0][1] would be [1,0,0] (row0's first three) and [1,1,1] (row1's last three). Dot product is 1*1 +0*1 +0*1=1. Multiply by 2 is 2. But in the output for Example0, the first row is [0,0,0]. Wait, that's not matching. So that can't be the case.\n\nHmm. Maybe this approach is wrong.\n\nAnother angle: the output for each example is a 3x3 matrix. Each output row corresponds to each input row, but how? Looking at Example0's output, all rows except the middle one are [0,0,0]. The middle row is [0,2,0]. So maybe the output is determined by some property of the input rows. Let's check the input rows for Example0:\n\nRow0: [1, 0, 0, 5, 0, 1, 0]\nRow1: [0, 1, 0, 5, 1, 1, 1]\nRow2: [1, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0]\n\nThe middle row (row1) has three 1s in the last three elements (positions 4,5,6). The first three elements (positions 0,1,2) are 0,1,0. The output middle row has a 2 in the middle. Maybe the sum of the product of first three and last three? Let's see. For row1, first three sum is 0+1+0=1. Last three sum is 1+1+1=3. 1*3=3. But output is 2. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, the sum of the first three elements multiplied by the sum of the last three. For row1: 1 *3=3. But output is 2. Not matching.\n\nWait, maybe the output is the count of positions where the first three elements of row i and the last three elements of row j both have 1s. Let's test this.\n\nIn Example0's output, for cell (1,1), row1's first three [0,1,0], row1's last three [1,1,1]. The overlapping 1s are position 1 in first three (since first three is [0,1,0]), and positions 0,1,2 in the last three. So in the first three of row i, the 1 is at index1. The last three of row j (same row here) are [1,1,1]. So in position 1 of the last three (since they are positions 4,5,6, but when considered as last three, indices 0,1,2). So when comparing the first three of i and last three of j, for each position in first three, check if the element is 1 and the corresponding position in j's last three is 1.\n\nWait, maybe for each row i and row j, we look at the first three elements of i and the last three elements of j. Then for each of the three positions (0,1,2), check if i's first three has a 1 and j's last three has a 1. The sum of these would be the number of positions where both are 1. Let's see.\n\nExample0:\n\nRow1's first three: [0,1,0]\nRow1's last three: [1,1,1]\n\nComparing each position:\n\n0th: 0 (i) and 1 (j) \u2192 0*1=0\n1st: 1 and 1 \u2192 1\n2nd: 0 and 1 \u2192 0\nSum is 1. But output[1][1] is 2. So that's not matching.\n\nHmm. Maybe there's another pattern. Let's think of the output as a 3x3 grid where each cell (i,j) corresponds to rows i and j in the input. Maybe there's a rule that combines certain elements from these two rows.\n\nLooking at Example1's output:\n\n[0,2,0]\n[0,0,2]\n[0,2,0]\n\nThe 2s are in positions (0,1), (1,2), (2,1). Let's check which rows those correspond to.\n\nFor (0,1): Row0 and Row1. Row0's first three are [1,1,0], Row1's last three are [1,1,1]. The product sum would be 1*1 +1*1 +0*1 =2. That matches the 2 here.\n\nFor (1,2): Row1's first three [0,0,1], Row2's last three [0,1,0]. Product sum is 0*0 +0*1 +1*0=0. But output is 2. So that's not matching. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe the positions are reversed. For cell (i,j), maybe we take the first three of row i and the last three of row j, but reverse one of them. For example, if we reverse the last three of j before taking the dot product.\n\nLet's try (1,2) in Example1. Row1's first three [0,0,1], Row2's last three [0,1,0]. Reversing the last three gives [0,1,0] \u2192 [0,1,0] (same as before). The dot product is 0*0 +0*1 +1*0=0. Still zero. Doesn't match.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the first three of row i and the last three of row j are aligned in a certain way. For example, the first element of the first three with the first of the last three, etc. But that's the same as before.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the sum of the first three elements of row i multiplied by the sum of the last three elements of row j, and then divided by some number. For Example0's (1,1):\n\nSum of first three of row1: 0+1+0=1\nSum of last three of row1:1+1+1=3\n1*3=3. But output is 2. So that's not it.\n\nWait, maybe the sum of the product of the first three of row i and the last three of row j, but only counting positions where both are 1. So for each position in 0,1,2, if row i's first three has 1 and row j's last three has 1, count 1. Otherwise 0. Then sum those.\n\nLet's check Example0's (1,1):\n\nRow1's first three: [0,1,0]\nRow1's last three: [1,1,1]\n\nPositions:\n\n0: 0 and 1 \u2192 0\n1: 1 and 1 \u2192 1\n2: 0 and 1 \u2192 0\nSum is 1. But output is 2. So no.\n\nHmm. Let's think again. The outputs have 0, 2. So maybe it's twice the number of matches.\n\nWait in Example0's (1,1) the sum is 1, output is 2. So 1*2=2. Maybe multiply by 2. Let's check Example1's (0,1):\n\nRow0's first three [1,1,0], row1's last three [1,1,1]. How many overlapping 1s? Positions 0: 1&1=1, position1:1&1=1, position2:0&1=0. Sum is 2. Multiply by 1 gives 2. Which matches the output.\n\nIn Example1's (1,2):\n\nRow1's first three [0,0,1], row2's last three [0,1,0]. Overlapping 1s: position2 (1 in row1's first three, 0 in row2's last three. Wait, row2's last three is [0,1,0]. So first three elements of row1 are [0,0,1], last three of row2 are [0,1,0]. Comparing each position:\n\n0: 0 vs 0 \u2192 no\n1:0 vs1 \u2192 no\n2:1 vs0 \u2192 no\nSo sum is 0. But output[1][2] is 2. That's conflicting. So this approach can't be right.\n\nWait, maybe it's the number of times a 1 appears in either the first three of row i or the last three of row j, but that's vague.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is determined by the number of 1s in the first three elements of each row and the last three elements of each row. But how?\n\nLooking at Example0's output: the middle row (row1) has sum of first three 1 and sum of last three 3. The output here is 2. So maybe 1 +3 =4, but that's not 2.\n\nAlternatively, 3 -1=2. So maybe subtract the first three sum from the last three sum. For row1, 3-1=2. Which is the middle output. But then how does this apply to other examples.\n\nIn Example1's output, for cell (0,1), which is row0 and row1. Row0's first three sum is 2, row1's last three sum is3. 3-2=1. But output is 2. Doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. Let me try a different approach. Let's look at the outputs and see if there's a pattern in their positions.\n\nIn Example0's output, only the center cell is 2. The inputs have the middle row's first three elements as [0,1,0], and the last three as [1,1,1]. Maybe the 2 comes from the sum of the first three and last three elements where they are both 1. So, in row1, the first three has a 1 in position1, and the last three has 1s in positions0,1,2. So position1 in both has 1. So 1 occurrence, multiplied by 2 gives 2. That could be.\n\nBut in Example1's output, the (0,1) cell is 2. For row0's first three [1,1,0], row1's last three [1,1,1]. The positions where both have 1s are positions0 and1. So sum is 2, multiplied by1 gives 2. That matches.\n\nThen in Example1's (1,2) cell: row1's first three [0,0,1], row2's last three [0,1,0]. The positions where both have 1: row1's third element (position2) is 1, and row2's last three's second position (position1) is1. Wait, how are the positions aligned? Are we comparing the first element of the first three with the first element of the last three, or the first element with the last element?\n\nWait, if row i's first three is [a,b,c], and row j's last three is [d,e,f], then the positions are compared as (a & d), (b & e), (c & f). Then, for each of these three pairs, if both are 1, count 1. Sum them up. Then multiply by some factor.\n\nIn Example1's (1,2) cell:\n\nRow1's first three: [0,0,1]\nRow2's last three: [0,1,0]\n\nCompare each pair:\n\n0 vs0 \u2192 0\n0 vs1 \u2192 0\n1 vs0 \u2192 0\nSum is 0. So output should be 0, but it's 2. So this doesn't fit. So that's not the case.\n\nHmm. This is tricky. Let's think differently. Maybe the output is a 3x3 matrix where each cell (i,j) is the sum of the i-th row's first three elements and j-th row's last three elements, but only if the fourth element (which is 5) meets a certain condition. But the fourth element is always 5, so maybe it's irrelevant. Or maybe it's a separator between the first three and last three elements.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each input row is divided into two parts: the first three elements, 5, and the last three. Then, for each pair of rows, compare their first and last parts in some way.\n\nWait, perhaps each output cell (i,j) is the number of times that the first three elements of row i and the last three elements of row j have a 1 in the same position, multiplied by 2. Let's test this.\n\nFor Example0's (1,1):\n\nRow1's first three: [0,1,0]\nRow1's last three: [1,1,1]\n\nMatching 1s in position1 (1 and1). So count is1. Multiply by2 gives2. Which matches output.\n\nFor Example1's (0,1):\n\nRow0's first three [1,1,0], Row1's last three [1,1,1]. Matching positions0 and1. Count is2. Multiply by1 gives2. Which matches the output cell (0,1) as 2.\n\nFor Example1's (1,2):\n\nRow1's first three [0,0,1], Row2's last three [0,1,0]. Only position2 in first and position0 in last. But since it's first three of i and last three of j, the positions are aligned. So first three of i's position0 vs j's last three's position0. So i's first three has [0,0,1], j's last three has [0,1,0]. So:\n\nposition0: 0 vs0 \u2192 0 (both 0)\nposition1:0 vs1 \u2192 no\nposition2:1 vs0 \u2192 no.\n\nNo matches. So count is0. But the output is2 here. So this can't be right.\n\nHmm. There's a problem here. Maybe the alignment isn't direct. Maybe the first three elements of i are aligned in reverse with the last three elements of j.\n\nFor Example1's (1,2):\n\nRow1's first three: [0,0,1] \u2192 reversed [1,0,0]\nRow2's last three: [0,1,0] \u2192 same as before.\n\nCompare reversed first three of i with last three of j:\n\n1 vs0 \u2192 0\n0 vs1 \u21920\n0 vs0 \u21920. Sum 0. No.\n\nAlternatively, maybe first three of i are aligned with last three of j in reverse. So first element of i's first three with last element of j's last three.\n\nFor Example1's (1,2):\n\nRow1's first three: [0,0,1]\nRow2's last three: [0,1,0] (positions0:0,1:1,2:0)\n\nAligned as i's 0 \u2192 j's 0 (position2)\ni's 0 \u2192 j's 1 (position1)\ni's 1 \u2192 j's 0 (position0)\n\nSo pairs are (0,0), (0,1), (1,0). Count where both are 1: none. So sum 0. Still no.\n\nThis isn't working. Let's try another approach.\n\nLooking at the output matrices, perhaps the 2s are placed where certain conditions are met. For example, in Example0's output, only the center cell is 2. That's where the middle row and middle column meet. The middle input row has a 1 in the second position of the first three, and the last three are all 1s. Maybe when a row's first three has a 1 in position1 and the last three of the same row has 1s, you get a 2 in the center.\n\nBut in Example1's output, the center cell (1,1) is 0, but the cell (1,2) is 2. So that theory doesn't hold.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is a result of comparing each row with all other rows. For instance, each output cell (i,j) represents the number of matching 1s between the first three of row i and the last three of row j. But how?\n\nIn Example0:\n\noutput[1][1] is 2. Let's compare row1's first three [0,1,0] and row1's last three [1,1,1]. The number of positions where both are 1 is 1 (position1). So why 2? Maybe it's multiplied by 2. So 1*2=2. That fits.\n\nIn Example1:\n\noutput[0][1] is 2. Row0's first three [1,1,0] and row1's last three [1,1,1]. Positions where both are 1: positions0 and1. So count is2. Multiply by1 gives2. Which matches.\n\noutput[1][2] is2. Row1's first three [0,0,1], row2's last three [0,1,0]. Comparing each position:\n\n0:0 vs0 \u2192 0\n0 vs1 \u21920\n1 vs0 \u21920. So count is0. But output is2. That doesn't fit. So this approach is incorrect.\n\nWait, but in Example1's output, the cell (1,2) is 2. So row1 and row2. Row1's first three are [0,0,1], row2's last three are [0,1,0]. Maybe I'm missing something here. Perhaps the first three elements of row i are compared with the last three elements of row j, but not aligned directly. Maybe it's the sum of all possible combinations where either element is 1. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's the sum of the first three elements of row i plus the sum of the last three elements of row j, then multiplied by some factor. For Example1's (1,2):\n\nSum of row1's first three:0+0+1=1\nSum of row2's last three:0+1+0=1\nTotal sum 2. Multiply by1 gives2. Which matches the cell (1,2) being 2. \n\nLet's check if this works for other cells.\n\nExample0's (1,1):\n\nRow1's first three sum 1, last three sum3. Total 4. Output is2. So 4/2=2. Maybe divided by 2.\n\nExample1's (0,1):\n\nRow0's first three sum2, row1's last three sum3. Total 5. 5/2=2.5, but output is2. Not quite.\n\nHmm. Maybe sum of the two sums minus some value. Like (sum_i + sum_j) - something. For Example1's (1,2): 1 +1=2. Output is2. For Example0's (1,1):1+3=4. Output is2. 4-2=2. For Example1's (0,1):2+3=5. 5-3=2. But this seems arbitrary.\n\nAlternatively, the output is the minimum of the two sums. For Example0's (1,1): min(1,3)=1. Output is2. No.\n\nAlternatively, the product of the two sums modulo something. For Example0's (1,1):1*3=3 mod something gives2. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the sum of the two sums divided by something. For Example0's (1,1):4/2=2. Which fits. Example1's (1,2): (1+1)=2/1=2. Fits. Example1's (0,1):2+3=5. 5/2=2.5. Output is2. Maybe taking the floor. 5//2=2. Which fits. Let's check other cells.\n\nExample1's (0,0): sum of row0's first three (2) + row0's last three sum (0+1+0=1). Total 3. Divided by 2 gives1.5, floor to1. But output[0][0] is0. So this doesn't work.\n\nHmm. Not consistent.\n\nLet's think back to the initial examples. In Example0's input, the middle row has a 1 in position1 (first three) and three 1s in the last three. The output is 2 in the middle cell. In Example1, the output has 2s in cells (0,1), (1,2), (2,1). Each of these may correspond to pairs of rows where the first three of i and the last three of j have certain properties.\n\nWait, maybe the output cell (i,j) is twice the number of 1s in the first three of row i plus the number of 1s in the last three of row j. But for Example0's (1,1): first three has1, last three has3. 1+3=4. 4*0.5=2. So output is2. For Example1's (0,1): first three sum2, last three sum3. 2+3=5. 5*0.4=2. But this is arbitrary.\n\nAlternatively, maybe output cell (i,j) is 2 if the number of 1s in the first three of row i and the last three of row j is even, but that seems unrelated.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's the count of 1s in the XOR of the first three of i and last three of j. Let's see:\n\nExample0's (1,1): XOR of [0,1,0] and [1,1,1] is [1,0,1]. Sum is2. Output is2. That fits.\n\nExample1's (0,1): XOR of [1,1,0] and [1,1,1] is [0,0,1]. Sum is1. Output is2. Doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. So that's not it.\n\nWait, maybe the sum is of the element-wise multiplication (dot product) between the first three of i and the last three of j, multiplied by 2.\n\nFor Example0's (1,1):\n\n[0,1,0] \u00b7 [1,1,1] =0+1+0=1. Multiply by2 \u21922. Which matches.\n\nExample1's (0,1):\n\n[1,1,0] \u00b7 [1,1,1] =1+1+0=2. Multiply by1 \u21922. Which matches the output.\n\nExample1's (1,2):\n\n[0,0,1] \u00b7 [0,1,0] =0+0+0=0. Multiply by2 \u21920. Doesn't match the output which is2.\n\nBut in Example1's output, (1,2) is2. So this approach doesn't work for that.\n\nWait, but maybe there's a mistake in my calculation. Let me check Example1's (1,2) again.\n\nRow1's first three: [0,0,1]\nRow2's last three: [0,1,0]\n\nDot product: 0*0 +0*1 +1*0 =0. Multiply by2 gives0. But output is2. So this is a discrepancy.\n\nHmm. So this approach works for some cells but not all. Maybe there's another factor involved. Let's think again.\n\nLooking at Example1's (1,2) output of 2. What if the first three of row1 is [0,0,1], and the last three of row2 is [0,1,0]. But the fourth element is 5. Maybe there's a relation with the fourth element. But all rows have 5 as the fourth element.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the fourth element is a separator, and the first three and last three are being compared in reverse order. For example, the first three elements are compared to the last three elements in reverse.\n\nIn Example1's (1,2) cell:\n\nRow1's first three: [0,0,1]\nRow2's last three: [0,1,0] reversed \u2192 [0,1,0] (same as original)\n\nDot product is 0*0 +0*1 +1*0 =0. Still 0.\n\nAlternatively, reverse the first three of row i.\n\nRow1's first three reversed: [1,0,0]\nRow2's last three: [0,1,0]\nDot product:1*0 +0*1 +0*0 =0.\n\nNo help.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the first three of i are aligned with the last three of j, but shifted in position. For example, first element of i's first three is multiplied with the second element of j's last three, etc. But this is arbitrary.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the sum of the first three of i plus the sum of the last three of j. For Example1's (1,2): sum of first three is1 (0+0+1), sum of last three of j is1 (0+1+0). Total 2. Which matches the output. \n\nFor Example0's (1,1): sum first three1, sum last three3. Total 4. Output is2. Which is 4/2=2. So maybe average. But for Example1's (0,1): sum first three2, sum last three3. Total5, which would give5/2=2.5, but output is2. So maybe floor division.\n\nBut how does this work for other cells?\n\nExample1's (0,0):\n\nSum first three2, sum last three1 \u21923. Divided by1.5 gives2. But output is0. So this doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. This is getting frustrating. Let's try to think of the outputs as 3x3 grids where each cell represents a specific interaction between rows. \n\nAnother observation: all outputs have only 0s and 2s. Maybe the 2s occur when there are exactly two matches in some criteria.\n\nLooking back at Example2:\n\nInput:\n\n[0,0,1,5,0,0,0]\n[1,1,0,5,1,0,1]\n[0,1,1,5,1,0,1]\n\nOutput:\n\n[0,0,0]\n[2,0,0]\n[0,0,2]\n\nSo output[1][0] is2, and output[2][2] is2.\n\nLooking at output[1][0]: row1 and row0.\n\nRow1's first three: [1,1,0]\nRow0's last three: [0,0,0]\n\nHow many positions where both are 1? None. So sum0. But output is2. So that's a problem.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the criteria is different. Let's think of the output cell (i,j) as 2 if the sum of the first three of row i and the last three of row j is exactly 2. \n\nFor Example0's (1,1): sum first three1 + sum last three3=4. No. Output is2. Doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, output cell is 2 if the sum of the first three of row i and the sum of the last three of row j equals 4. For Example0's (1,1):1+3=4 \u2192 yes. Output is2. For Example1's (0,1):2+3=5\u2192 no. Output is2. Doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, the product of the sums equals 3. For Example0's (1,1):1*3=3 \u2192 no. Output is2. Doesn't fit.\n\nThis is really challenging. Let's try to find another approach. Let's look at the input rows and their corresponding output rows. \n\nWait, the output matrices are 3x3, so perhaps each output row corresponds to the input row, but the input row's first three elements are processed in a certain way. For example, each input row is transformed into a 3-element array, and the output is a matrix where each row is the transformed version of each input row. But how?\n\nLooking at Example0's input rows:\n\nRow0: [1,0,0,5,0,1,0] \u2192 output row0 [0,0,0]\nRow1: [0,1,0,5,1,1,1] \u2192 output row1 [0,2,0]\nRow2: [1,0,0,5,0,0,0] \u2192 output row2 [0,0,0]\n\nSo the middle input row is the only one with a non-zero output row. The output row has a 2 in the middle. The middle input row has first three [0,1,0] and last three [1,1,1]. Maybe the output row is determined by the sum of the first three elements and the sum of the last three elements. For example, if the sum of first three is1 and sum of last three is3, then the middle output cell is2. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe each element in the output row is the sum of the corresponding first and last elements. For example, for output row1 in Example0:\n\nSum of first three elements of row1:0+1+0=1\nSum of last three elements:1+1+1=3\nBut the output row is [0,2,0]. Not sure.\n\nAnother idea: the output matrix is the result of some matrix multiplication between a matrix derived from the first three elements and another derived from the last three elements. For instance, if we create two matrices A and B where A is the first three elements of each row and B is the last three elements of each row transposed, then the product of A and B could be the output matrix. Let's check this.\n\nFor Example0:\n\nMatrix A (3x3):\nRow0:1,0,0\nRow1:0,1,0\nRow2:1,0,0\n\nMatrix B (3x3 transposed of last three elements):\nRow0:0,1,0 \u2192 transposed as columns\nRow1:1,1,1\nRow2:0,0,0\n\nA * B would be:\n\nRow0 of A multiplied by each column of B:\n\nFor cell (0,0):1*0 +0*1 +0*0 =0 \u2192 matches output[0][0]\nCell (0,1):1*1 +0*1 +0*0 =1 \u2192 but output is0. Doesn't match.\n\nThis approach doesn't work.\n\nWait, maybe the output is the product of matrix A (first three elements) and matrix B (last three elements) multiplied by 2.\n\nFor Example0's (1,1) cell:\n\nA is Row1: [0,1,0]\nB is Column1: [1,1,0] (from the last three elements of each row transposed?)\n\nWait, the last three elements of each row in Example0 are:\n\nRow0:0,1,0\nRow1:1,1,1\nRow2:0,0,0\n\nSo matrix B (transposed) would be:\n\nColumns as:\n0,1,0\n1,1,0\n0,1,0 (assuming rows are the last three elements, transposed to columns).\n\nBut matrix multiplication would be:\n\nRow1 of A: [0,1,0] multiplied by Column1 of B (1,1,0):\n\n0*1 +1*1 +0*0 =1. Multiply by 2 gives2, which matches the output[1][1].\n\nCell (0,1) in Example0: Row0 of A [1,0,0] multiplied by Column1 of B [1,1,0]:\n\n1*1 +0*1 +0*0=1 \u2192 1*2=2. But output[0][1] is0. So this doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. So this approach works for the center cell but not others. Perhaps only certain cells are considered.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the diagonal of the matrix product of A and B. For Example0, the diagonal would be the cells (0,0), (1,1), (2,2). For (1,1) it's1*2=2. Other diagonals are0. Which matches the output.\n\nBut in Example0's output, only the center cell is 2. The other diagonals are0. For Example1:\n\nMatrix A:\n\nRow0:1,1,0\nRow1:0,0,1\nRow2:1,1,0\n\nMatrix B (last three elements of each row transposed):\n\nRow0:0,1,0 \u2192 column0:0, column1:1, column2:0\nRow1:1,1,1 \u2192 column0:1, column1:1, column2:1\nRow2:0,1,0 \u2192 column0:0, column1:1, column2:0\n\nThe product A*B would be:\n\nCell (0,0):1*0 +1*1 +0*0 =1 \u2192 2 if multiplied by2. Output is0.\nCell (0,1):1*1 +1*1 +0*1=2 \u2192 4. Output is2. So if we multiply by1, 2 matches.\nCell (1,2):0*0 +0*1 +1*0=0 \u21920. Output is2. Doesn't fit.\n\nThis is getting too complicated. Maybe there's a simpler pattern that I'm missing. Let's look at the test input and see if applying a certain rule gives a logical output.\n\nTest input:\n\n[1,0,1,5,1,0,1]\n[0,1,0,5,1,0,1]\n[1,0,1,5,0,1,0]\n\nEach row has first three elements, a 5, then last three. Let's assume that each output cell (i,j) is twice the number of positions where the first three of row i and the last three of row j have a 1 in the same position.\n\nLet's compute this for the test input.\n\nRow0's first three: [1,0,1]\nRow0's last three: [1,0,1]\nRow1's first three: [0,1,0]\nRow1's last three: [1,0,1]\nRow2's first three: [1,0,1]\nRow2's last three: [0,1,0]\n\nNow, compute output for each cell (i,j):\n\nFor cell (0,0):\n\nRow0's first three [1,0,1] and Row0's last three [1,0,1]. Comparing each position:\n\n1&1=1 \u2192 position0\n0&0=0\n1&1=1 \u2192 position2. So two matches. Multiply by2 \u21924. But outputs in examples only have 0 or 2. So this can't be right.\n\nWait, examples have outputs up to 2. So maybe it's the count of matches, not multiplied by anything. But in Example0's (1,1), the count was1, output was2. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, if the count is multiplied by2 only if the fourth element (5) is present. But all rows have 5.\n\nHmm. Let's try this approach for the test input, but according to the examples, maybe the output cell is twice the count of matching 1s between the first three of row i and the last three of row j.\n\nFor Test input:\n\ncell (0,0): [1,0,1] vs [1,0,1] \u2192 matches at positions0 and2. count=2 \u21922*1=2.\nBut in Example0's (0,0), it was 0. So this doesn't fit.\n\nBut according to this, the test's cell (0,0) would be 2*2=4, which isn't possible given previous examples.\n\nThis is really confusing. Maybe I need to look for another pattern.\n\nWait, in Example0, the output is a matrix where only the center cell is 2. In Example1, there are three 2s forming a kind of diagonal. In Example2, there are two 2s in different positions. \n\nAnother observation: the output matrices are symmetric in Example1 but not in Example2. Not sure if that helps.\n\nAlternatively, the output might be based on the sum of the first three elements of the row i and the sum of the last three elements of the row j. If the sum of the first three is a and the sum of the last three is b, then output is a*b. Let's test:\n\nExample0's (1,1): a=1, b=3 \u21923. Output is2. Doesn't fit.\n\nExample1's (0,1): a=2, b=3 \u21926. Output is2. No.\n\nNot helpful.\n\nLet me try to think outside the box. The fourth element is 5 in every input row. Maybe it's a red herring. So the input rows are effectively split into two groups: the first three elements and the last three elements. The 5 is just a separator.\n\nNow, the output is a 3x3 matrix where each cell (i,j) is 2 if the first three elements of row i and the last three elements of row j have exactly two 1s in common. But how?\n\nWait, in Example1's output, cell (0,1) is 2. Row0's first three [1,1,0], row1's last three [1,1,1]. The number of positions where both are 1 is 2 (positions0 and1). So 2, which is the output.\n\nCell (1,2) in Example1: row1's first three [0,0,1], row2's last three [0,1,0]. Only position2 of row1's first three is 1, but row2's last three's position2 is0. So no matches. So output should be0, but it's 2. Doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. This is leading me nowhere. Maybe I should look at the output matrices and see if they resemble some known matrix operation, but with modifications. For example, the output matrices have 0s and 2s, suggesting they might be twice the value of some binary matrix.\n\nAnother idea: Perhaps the output is a matrix where each cell (i,j) is 2 if the first three elements of row i are the reverse of the last three elements of row j, otherwise 0. Let's test this.\n\nExample0's (1,1):\n\nRow1's first three: [0,1,0]\nRow1's last three: [1,1,1]. Reverse is [1,1,1]. Not the same as [0,1,0]. So output is0. But the output is2. Doesn't fit.\n\nExample1's (0,1):\n\nRow0's first three [1,1,0], reverse is [0,1,1]. Row1's last three [1,1,1]. Not the same. So output would be0. But output is2. No.\n\nNot working.\n\nLet me try to summarize what I've tried so far and see if there's a pattern I missed:\n\n- Dot product of first three and last three elements of rows, multiplied by 2. Works for some cells but not others.\n- Counting the number of overlapping 1s between first three and last three elements. Works for some cells but not others.\n- Sum of elements in first three and last three, divided by something. Not consistent.\n- XOR sum. No.\n\nAt this point, perhaps the correct approach is the dot product of the first three elements of row i and the last three elements of row j, multiplied by 2. Despite it not working for all cells, maybe the test input follows this pattern.\n\nLet's apply this to the test input and see if the answer matches the examples' pattern.\n\nTest input rows:\n\nRow0: [1,0,1,5,1,0,1] \u2192 first three [1,0,1], last three [1,0,1]\nRow1: [0,1,0,5,1,0,1] \u2192 first three [0,1,0], last three [1,0,1]\nRow2: [1,0,1,5,0,1,0] \u2192 first three [1,0,1], last three [0,1,0]\n\nCompute output matrix:\n\nFor each cell (i,j), compute the dot product of row i's first three and row j's last three, then multiply by 2.\n\nLet's calculate each cell:\n\nCell (0,0): [1,0,1] \u00b7 [1,0,1] \u21921*1 +0*0 +1*1 =2 \u21922*2=4? But examples have max 2. So this can't be right.\n\nWait, but examples have outputs up to 2. Maybe the actual calculation is the dot product without multiplying by anything, but how?\n\nIn Example0's (1,1): dot product is1, output is2. So 1*2=2.\n\nIn Example1's (0,1): dot product is2, output is2. 2*1=2.\n\nIn Example1's (1,2): dot product is0, output is2. So this approach doesn't work.\n\nBut if we ignore the multiplication and just take the dot product as the output, then Example0's (1,1) would be1, but output is2. So that's not it.\n\nThis is perplexing. Let me try to re-express the examples and see if there's a pattern I can see.\n\nIn Example0:\n\nOnly the middle cell is 2. The middle row's first three has 1 in the middle, and the last three are all 1s. So the dot product of first three [0,1,0] and last three [1,1,1] is1. Output is2.\n\nIn Example1:\n\nCells (0,1), (1,2), (2,1) are2. For (0,1):\n\nRow0 first three [1,1,0], row1's last three [1,1,1]. Dot product2. Output2.\n\nCell (1,2): row1's first three [0,0,1], row2's last three [0,1,0]. Dot product0. Output2. Doesn't fit.\n\nCell (2,1): row2's first three [1,1,0], row1's last three [1,1,1]. Dot product2. Output2.\n\nSo two of the three 2s fit the dot product theory, but one doesn't.\n\nIn Example2's output, cell (1,0) is2:\n\nRow1's first three [1,1,0], row0's last three [0,0,0]. Dot product0. Output2. Doesn't fit.\n\nThis inconsistency suggests that the pattern is not a simple dot product. However, given the time I've spent and the need to provide an answer, I'll proceed with the assumption that the output cells are twice the dot product of the first three of row i and the last three of row j. Even though it doesn't fit all examples, it might be the intended pattern.\n\nApplying this to the test input:\n\nTest input rows:\n\nRow0: first three [1,0,1], last three [1,0,1]\nRow1: first three [0,1,0], last three [1,0,1]\nRow2: first three [1,0,1], last three [0,1,0]\n\nCalculating each cell (i,j):\n\ncell (0,0): [1,0,1] \u00b7 [1,0,1] \u21921*1 +0*0 +1*1=2 \u2192 2*2=4. But examples have max 2. So this can't be. But according to this, the output would be 4, which is impossible. Thus, this approach is invalid.\n\nHmm. This indicates that my assumption is wrong. Let me think once more.\n\nAnother idea: The output cell (i,j) is 2 if the first three of row i and the last three of row j have exactly two 1s in common. Let's check:\n\nExample0's (1,1): first three [0,1,0], last three [1,1,1]. Only one position (1) where both are 1. Output is2. So this doesn't fit.\n\nExample1's (0,1): two positions (0 and1) where both are 1. Output is2. This fits.\n\nExample1's (1,2): no positions. Output is2. Doesn't fit.\n\nExample2's (1,0): no positions. Output is2. Doesn't fit.\n\nThis is also not working.\n\nAt this point, I'm stuck. Given the time constraints, I'll make an educated guess based on the examples. The test input's output might be:\n\n[2, 0, 0]\n[0, 2, 0]\n[0, 0, 2]\n\nBut I'm not sure. Alternatively, applying the dot product approach where possible:\n\nFor the test input:\n\nRow0's first three: [1,0,1]\nRow0's last three: [1,0,1]\nCell (0,0): 1*1 +0*0 +1*1=2 \u2192 output2.\nCell (0,1): row0's first three [1,0,1] and row1's last three [1,0,1] \u21921*1 +0*0 +1*1=2 \u2192 output2.\nCell (0,2): row0's first three and row2's last three [0,1,0] \u21921*0 +0*1 +1*0=0 \u21920.\nRow1's first three [0,1,0]:\nCell (1,0): 0*1 +1*0 +0*1=0 \u21920.\nCell (1,1):0*1 +1*0 +0*1=0 \u21920.\nCell (1,2):0*0 +1*1 +0*0=1 \u21922.\nRow2's first three [1,0,1]:\nCell (2,0):1*1 +0*0 +1*1=2 \u21922.\nCell (2,1):1*1 +0*0 +1*1=2 \u21922.\nCell (2,2):1*0 +0*1 +1*0=0 \u21920.\n\nPutting this together, the output matrix would be:\n\n[2, 2, 0]\n[0, 0, 2]\n[2, 2, 0]\n\nBut this doesn't match any of the example patterns, which often have symmetry.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct answer is:\n\n[0, 0, 2]\n[0, 2, 0]\n[2, 0, 0]\n\nBut without a clear pattern, it's hard to say. Given the examples, especially Example2, where the output has 2s in cells (1,0) and (2,2), I'll tentatively guess that the test output is:\n\n[0, 2, 0]\n[2, 0, 0]\n[0, 0, 2]\n\nBut I'm not confident. Another possible approach is that the output is the count of 1s in the first three of row i and the last three of row j, but only where the positions are mirrored. For example, position0 of first three with position2 of last three, position1 with position1, position2 with position0. \n\nFor test input cell (0,1):\n\nRow0's first three: [1,0,1]\nRow1's last three: [1,0,1]\n\nMirrored comparison:\n\n1 (pos0) with1 (pos2 of last three) \u2192 1*1=1\n0 (pos1) with0 (pos1) \u21920*0=0\n1 (pos2) with1 (pos0) \u21921*1=1\nSum is2 \u2192 output2.\n\nCell (1,2):\n\nRow1's first three [0,1,0] and row2's last three [0,1,0].\n\nMirrored:\n\n0 vs0 \u21920\n1 vs1 \u21921\n0 vs0 \u21920. Sum1 \u2192 output2.\n\nHmm. This could explain some cells. Maybe the pattern is twice the sum of the mirrored positions' product.\n\nFor Example0's (1,1):\n\nRow1's first three [0,1,0] and row1's last three [1,1,1].\n\nMirrored:\n\n0 vs1 (pos0 vs pos2) \u21920*1=0\n1 vs1 (pos1 vs pos1) \u21921*1=1\n0 vs1 (pos2 vs pos0) \u21920*1=0. Sum1 \u2192 output2. Fits.\n\nExample1's (1,2):\n\nRow1's first three [0,0,1] and row2's last three [0,1,0].\n\nMirrored:\n\n0 vs0 (pos0 vs pos2) \u21920*0=0\n0 vs1 (pos1 vs pos1) \u21920*1=0\n1 vs0 (pos2 vs pos0) \u21921*0=0. Sum0 \u2192 output2. Doesn't fit.\n\nBut in Example1's (1,2) the output is2. So this approach doesn't work.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and the lack of a clear pattern, I'll make an educated guess that the output cell (i,j) is twice the dot product of the first three elements of row i and the last three elements of row j. Even though this doesn't fit all examples, it's the best I can come up with.\n\nApplying this to the test input:\n\nRow0's first three: [1,0,1]\nRow0's last three: [1,0,1]\nCell (0,0): (1*1 +0*0 +1*1)*2= (2)*2=4 \u2192 but outputs in examples are 0 or 2. So this can't be right.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the dot product is taken and then modulo 3. For example0's (1,1) dot product1 \u2192 1*2=2 mod3 \u21922. \n\nFor test input cell (0,0):2 mod3=2. Output2.\n\nCell (0,1): row0 first three [1,0,1], row1's last three [1,0,1]. Dot product 1+0+1=2. 2*1=2. Output2.\n\nCell (0,2): [1,0,1] \u00b7 [0,1,0] \u21920+0+0=0. Output0.\n\nRow1's first three [0,1,0]:\n\nCell (1,0): [0,1,0] \u00b7 [1,0,1] \u21920*1 +1*0 +0*1=0. Output0.\n\nCell (1,1): [0,1,0] \u00b7 [1,0,1] \u21920+0+0=0. Output0.\n\nCell (1,2): [0,1,0] \u00b7 [0,1,0] \u21920+1+0=1. 1*2=2. Output2.\n\nRow2's first three [1,0,1]:\n\nCell (2,0): [1,0,1] \u00b7 [1,0,1] \u21921+0+1=2. Output2.\n\nCell (2,1): [1,0,1] \u00b7 [1,0,1] \u21922. Output2.\n\nCell (2,2): [1,0,1] \u00b7 [0,1,0] \u21920+0+0=0. Output0.\n\nSo the output matrix would be:\n\n[2,2,0]\n[0,0,2]\n[2,2,0]\n\nBut none of the training examples have multiple 2s in a row. However, Example1's output has three 2s in different positions. This might be the case here. But I'm not sure if this is correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the answer is:\n\n[0,2,0]\n[0,0,2]\n[0,2,0]\n\nBut I can't verify this with confidence. Given the time I've invested, I'll proceed with the latter.",

        "cot_2": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. So we have these inputs and outputs, and I need to see how the input lists are transformed into the output matrices. Let's look at the examples one by one.\n\nStarting with Example 0. The input has three rows, each with seven elements. The output is a 3x3 matrix. Hmm, maybe each row in the input corresponds to a row in the output? But the output is 3x3, and the input has three rows. Wait, maybe each element in the output is derived from some combination of the input elements.\n\nLooking at the first input row of Example 0: [1, 0, 0, 5, 0, 1, 0]. The output first row is [0, 0, 0]. Let's check the other rows. The middle input row is [0, 1, 0, 5, 1, 1, 1], and the middle output row is [0, 2, 0]. The third input row is [1,0,0,5,0,0,0], output [0,0,0].\n\nWhat's special about the middle input row? Maybe the fifth element (index 4) is 1 here, while others are 0. But the output's middle element in that row is 2. Wait, maybe the output counts something related to the surrounding elements in the input.\n\nWait, perhaps each output cell corresponds to a 3x3 grid in the input, but the input rows are longer. Alternatively, maybe the output is derived from the elements around the fifth position (since the fifth element is 5 in some cases, but in the input examples, the fourth element is always 5. Oh, in all input rows, the fourth element is 5. So maybe that's a marker or a fixed value. So perhaps the 5 is a separator or indicates something. Let's check the input rows again.\n\nLooking at Example 0's inputs:\n\nRow 0: 1,0,0,5,0,1,0\n\nRow 1: 0,1,0,5,1,1,1\n\nRow 2:1,0,0,5,0,0,0\n\nEach row has 5 as the fourth element. So maybe the array is split into parts before and after the 5. For example, before 5 (positions 0-3) and after (positions 4-6). Let's see.\n\nIn Example 0's output, the middle row has a 2 in the middle. Let's check the input rows. The middle row (row 1) has after the 5: 1,1,1. So maybe the sum of the elements after the 5? But 1+1+1=3, but the output is 2. Alternatively, maybe the number of 1s in that part. But 3 ones would sum to 3. Hmm. Wait, the output for row 1 is [0,2,0], the middle element is 2. So maybe it's the sum of the elements in the after-5 part (positions 4-6), but divided by something? Let's see: 1+1+1=3, but 3 is not 2. So that might not be it.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 5 is in the middle, and we consider elements before and after. Let's check for the middle row of Example 0. The elements before 5 are [0,1,0], and after are [1,1,1]. Maybe the sum of the products of corresponding elements before and after. For example, 0*1 +1*1 +0*1 = 1. That gives 1, but output is 2. Not matching.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 5 is part of a grid. Wait, maybe the input is a 3-row array where each row is split into two parts (before and after 5), each part having 3 elements. But the input rows have 7 elements each. Let me count: positions 0-3 (4 elements), then position 3 is 5, then positions 4-6 (3 elements). Wait, maybe the first three elements before 5 and the three elements after. But the first three would be positions 0-2, then 5 is at position 3, then positions 4-6. So maybe each input row is divided into left (3 elements), 5, right (3 elements). So for each row, left is positions 0-2, right is 4-6.\n\nThen, the output is a 3x3 matrix where each cell (i,j) is the sum of left[i] * right[j] across all three rows. Wait, that could be possible. Let's check.\n\nTake Example 0's input:\n\nRow 0 left: [1,0,0], right: [0,1,0]\n\nRow 1 left: [0,1,0], right: [1,1,1]\n\nRow 2 left: [1,0,0], right: [0,0,0]\n\nThe output is a 3x3 matrix. Let's see if each output cell (i,j) is the sum of left[i] * right[j] from each row.\n\nWait, but each row in the input contributes to the sum. For example, the output cell (0,0) would be left[0] from each row multiplied by right[0] of the same row, summed across all rows.\n\nWait, let's compute for Example 0:\n\nFor output cell (0,0):\n\nRow 0: left[0] is 1, right[0] is 0 \u2192 1*0 = 0\n\nRow 1: left[0] is 0, right[0] is 1 \u2192 0*1=0\n\nRow 2: left[0] is 1, right[0] is 0 \u2192 1*0=0\n\nSum: 0+0+0=0. So output[0][0] is 0. Which matches the output [0,0,0] for the first row.\n\nOutput cell (0,1):\n\nRow 0: left[0] (1) * right[1] (1) \u2192 1*1=1\n\nRow 1: left[0] (0) * right[1] (1) \u2192 0*1=0\n\nRow 2: left[0] (1) * right[1] (0) \u2192 1*0=0\n\nSum: 1+0+0=1. But the output's first row is [0,0,0], so this doesn't match. Hmm. Maybe this approach is wrong.\n\nWait, maybe each row in the input contributes to a row in the output. For example, each input row's left and right parts are multiplied as vectors to form a matrix, and then sum all those matrices across all rows.\n\nWait, for each input row, left is a 3-element vector, right is a 3-element vector. Their outer product would be a 3x3 matrix where element (i,j) is left[i] * right[j]. Then, summing all these outer products for each input row gives the output matrix.\n\nLet's test this with Example 0.\n\nInput rows:\n\nRow 0: left [1,0,0], right [0,1,0]\n\nOuter product matrix for row 0:\n\n[1*0, 1*1, 1*0] \u2192 [0,1,0]\n\n[0*0, 0*1, 0*0] \u2192 [0,0,0]\n\n[0*0, 0*1, 0*0] \u2192 [0,0,0]\n\nSo the matrix for row 0 is:\n\n[0,1,0]\n\n[0,0,0]\n\n[0,0,0]\n\nRow 1: left [0,1,0], right [1,1,1]\n\nOuter product:\n\nRow 0 (left[0] =0): [0*1, 0*1, 0*1] \u2192 [0,0,0]\n\nRow 1 (left[1] =1): [1*1, 1*1, 1*1] \u2192 [1,1,1]\n\nRow 2 (left[2] =0): [0*1, 0*1, 0*1] \u2192 [0,0,0]\n\nSo matrix for row 1 is:\n\n[0,0,0]\n\n[1,1,1]\n\n[0,0,0]\n\nRow 2: left [1,0,0], right [0,0,0]\n\nOuter product:\n\nAll elements 0.\n\nSumming all three matrices:\n\nRow 0 matrices:\n\nRow0: [0,1,0] + Row1: [0,0,0] + Row2: [0,0,0] \u2192 sum is [0,1,0]\n\nRow1 matrices:\n\nRow0's row1: [0,0,0] + Row1's row1: [1,1,1] + Row2's row1: [0,0,0] \u2192 sum [1,1,1]\n\nRow2 matrices:\n\nAll zeros. So sum is [0,0,0].\n\nSo overall sum would be:\n\n[0,1,0]\n\n[1,1,1]\n\n[0,0,0]\n\nBut the output for Example 0 is:\n\n[0,0,0]\n\n[0,2,0]\n\n[0,0,0]\n\nWhich doesn't match. So this approach is incorrect.\n\nHmm. Let's check another example. Example 1's output has a 2 in certain positions. Let's see if there's another pattern.\n\nLooking at Example 1's input:\n\nRow 0: [1,1,0,5,0,1,0] \u2192 left [1,1,0], right [0,1,0]\n\nRow 1: [0,0,1,5,1,1,1] \u2192 left [0,0,1], right [1,1,1]\n\nRow 2: [1,1,0,5,0,1,0] \u2192 same as row 0.\n\nOutput is:\n\n[0,2,0]\n\n[0,0,2]\n\n[0,2,0]\n\nWait, the middle row of output is [0,0,2], which might correspond to the sum of something in row 1 of the input. Let's see.\n\nIf we take each row's left and right parts, maybe count the number of positions where left and right have 1s in the same index. But left is 3 elements, right is 3 elements. For example, in row 0: left is [1,1,0], right is [0,1,0]. The positions where left and right are both 1 is index 1 (left[1] is 1, right[1] is 1). So that's 1 occurrence. If each row contributes to the output by adding 1 to the position (row index, occurrence count?), but that's unclear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output matrix is formed by each cell (i,j) being the sum of left[i] * right[j] for all rows. Let's try that for Example 1.\n\nRow 0's left: [1,1,0], right: [0,1,0]\n\nOuter product:\n\nRow 0 (left[0] =1) \u2192 [1*0, 1*1, 1*0] \u2192 [0,1,0]\n\nRow 1 (left[1] =1) \u2192 [0,1,0]\n\nRow 2 (left[2] =0) \u2192 [0,0,0]\n\nSo the matrix for row 0 is:\n\n[0,1,0]\n\n[0,1,0]\n\n[0,0,0]\n\nRow 1's left: [0,0,1], right: [1,1,1]\n\nOuter product:\n\nleft[0] =0 \u2192 [0,0,0]\n\nleft[1] =0 \u2192 [0,0,0]\n\nleft[2] =1 \u2192 [1*1, 1*1, 1*1] \u2192 [1,1,1]\n\nSo matrix for row 1 is:\n\n[0,0,0]\n\n[0,0,0]\n\n[1,1,1]\n\nRow 2 is same as row 0. So adding all three matrices:\n\nRow0 matrices (row0 and row2 contribute twice):\n\nFirst matrix (row0) gives:\n\nRow0: [0,1,0]\n\nRow1: [0,1,0]\n\nRow2: [0,0,0]\n\nRow1 matrix gives:\n\nRow0: [0,0,0]\n\nRow1: [0,0,0]\n\nRow2: [1,1,1]\n\nRow2 matrix (same as row0) gives again:\n\nRow0: [0,1,0]\n\nRow1: [0,1,0]\n\nRow2: [0,0,0]\n\nTotal sum:\n\nRow0: 0+0+0 =0, 1+0+1=2, 0+0+0=0 \u2192 [0,2,0]\n\nRow1:0+0+0=0, 1+0+1=2, 0+0+0=0 \u2192 [0,2,0]\n\nRow2:0+1+0=1, 0+1+0=1, 0+1+0=1 \u2192 but wait, the third row's sum would be:\n\nRow2 in the first matrix is 0, in the second matrix is [1,1,1], in the third matrix (row2) is 0. So sum for row2 would be 0 (from row0's matrix) +1 (from row1's matrix) +0 (from row2's matrix) \u2192 but each cell is summed. So:\n\nRow2 column0: 0 (from row0's matrix) +1 (from row1's row2) +0 (from row2's matrix) =1\n\nRow2 column1: 0 +1 +0 =1\n\nRow2 column2:0 +1 +0=1.\n\nBut the output's third row is [0,2,0]. So that doesn't match. Hmm. This approach gives a different result than the example output. So maybe that's not the pattern.\n\nLet me think again. Let's look at the outputs. In example 0, the middle row's middle element is 2. The input rows' middle row after 5 has 1,1,1. So maybe the output counts the sum of the right parts (after 5) where the left part has certain values. For example, the middle output element (i,j) is the sum of the right elements in row i where the left part's j-th element is 1. Or something like that.\n\nWait, in example 0's middle input row (row1), the left part is [0,1,0]. So left[1] is 1. The right part is [1,1,1]. The output's middle row is [0,2,0]. The middle element is 2. Maybe 2 is the sum of the right part (1+1+1=3) but why 2? Maybe it's the sum of the right part multiplied by the number of 1s in the left part. Left part has 1 one (in position 1). So 3 *1=3. Still not 2.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is the sum of the left elements multiplied by the sum of the right elements for each row. For example, for each row, compute (sum of left) * (sum of right), and then arrange those values in the output matrix based on some pattern. Let's check.\n\nExample 0:\n\nRow0: left sum is 1+0+0=1, right sum is 0+1+0=1 \u2192 1*1=1.\n\nRow1: left sum 0+1+0=1, right sum 1+1+1=3 \u2192 1*3=3.\n\nRow2: left sum 1+0+0=1, right sum 0+0+0=0 \u2192 1*0=0.\n\nTotal sum for all rows: 1+3+0=4. But the output is a matrix, not a single number. So maybe this isn't the case.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each output row corresponds to an input row, and the output elements are the count of 1's in the right part of the input row, but only where the left part of the same row has a 1 in certain positions. Let's see.\n\nIn Example0's output, the middle row is [0,2,0]. The middle input row's left part is [0,1,0], which has a 1 in position1. The right part is [1,1,1], which sums to 3. But output is 2. Not sure.\n\nWait, maybe the output matrix is 3x3 where each cell (i,j) is the sum of the right elements (after 5) in input row i where the left element j is 1. For example, in input row i, look at left[j], if it's 1, add the sum of the right part of that row to output[i][j].\n\nLet's test this for Example0.\n\nExample0's input rows:\n\nRow0: left [1,0,0], right sum 0+1+0=1. So left[j] is 1 at j=0. So output[0][0] +=1. Other cells in row0 would be 0. So output row0 would be [1,0,0].\n\nRow1: left [0,1,0], right sum 3. So output[1][1] +=3. So row1 would be [0,3,0].\n\nRow2: left [1,0,0], right sum 0. So output[2][0] +=0.\n\nSo overall output would be:\n\n[1,0,0]\n\n[0,3,0]\n\n[0,0,0]\n\nBut the actual output is all zeros except the middle row's middle element is 2. So this doesn't fit. Hmm.\n\nAlternative approach: Let's look for the outputs and see if they have any relation to the positions of 1s in the input's left and right parts.\n\nExample1's output is:\n\n[0,2,0]\n\n[0,0,2]\n\n[0,2,0]\n\nLooking at the input rows for Example1:\n\nRow0: left [1,1,0], right [0,1,0]\n\nRow1: left [0,0,1], right [1,1,1]\n\nRow2: same as row0.\n\nSo for each row, if left and right have 1s in certain positions, maybe the output is adding 1 to each position where left[i] and right[j] are 1 in the same row.\n\nFor example, row0 has left[0]=1 and right[1]=1 \u2192 so (0,1) in the output matrix gets +1.\n\nRow0 also has left[1]=1 and right[1]=1 \u2192 (1,1) gets +1.\n\nRow1 has left[2]=1 and right[0]=1 \u2192 (2,0) \u2192 but output row1 is [0,0,2]. Hmm, maybe each row's left and right are used to find positions in the output matrix. For example, for each input row, for each left[i] and right[j], if both are 1, add 1 to output[i][j].\n\nWait, let's try that.\n\nFor Example0:\n\nRow0: left [1,0,0], right [0,1,0]. So left[0] is 1. Right has 1 at position1. So when i=0 (left's index), j=1 (right's index), we add 1 to output[0][1]. But output row0 is [0,0,0]. Hmm, but in the output for Example0, the middle row is [0,2,0]. So maybe it's the sum across all rows for each possible (i,j) pair where left[i] and right[j] are 1.\n\nWait, for Example0:\n\nRow0: left[0]=1, right[1]=1 \u2192 output[0][1] +=1.\n\nRow1: left[1]=1, right[0], right[1], right[2] all 1. So for each j in 0,1,2 \u2192 output[1][j] +=1.\n\nRow2: left[0]=1, right all 0 \u2192 no additions.\n\nSo summing:\n\noutput[0][1] =1 (from row0)\n\noutput[1][0] =1 (from row1)\n\noutput[1][1] =1 (from row1)\n\noutput[1][2] =1 (from row1)\n\nBut the actual output for Example0 is:\n\n[0,0,0]\n\n[0,2,0]\n\n[0,0,0]\n\nHmm, this doesn't match. So perhaps not.\n\nBut wait, in the actual output for Example0, the middle cell (1,1) has 2. How could that happen?\n\nLooking at all rows:\n\nRow0's left and right contribute 1 to (0,1) \u2192 output[0][1] =1.\n\nRow1's left has 1 at index1. Right has three 1s. So for each j in 0,1,2, output[1][j] +=1. So output[1][0], [1][1], [1][2] each get +1. So the middle row would be [1,1,1]. But the example's output is [0,2,0]. So that's not matching.\n\nAlternative approach: Maybe the output matrix is the sum of the products of left[i] * right[j] for each row, but then multiplied by some factor. For example, Example1's output has 2s where sum might be 2. Let's compute for Example1.\n\nExample1's input rows:\n\nRow0: left [1,1,0], right [0,1,0]\n\nRow1: left [0,0,1], right [1,1,1]\n\nRow2: same as row0.\n\nFor each row, compute the outer product (left as column vector multiplied by right as row vector), then sum all three matrices.\n\nRow0's outer product:\n\n[1*0, 1*1, 1*0] \u2192 [0,1,0]\n\n[1*0, 1*1, 1*0] \u2192 [0,1,0]\n\n[0*0, 0*1, 0*0] \u2192 [0,0,0]\n\nRow1's outer product:\n\n[0*1,0*1,0*1] \u2192 [0,0,0]\n\n[0*1,0*1,0*1] \u2192 [0,0,0]\n\n[1*1,1*1,1*1] \u2192 [1,1,1]\n\nRow2 is same as row0, so adds again:\n\n[0,1,0]\n\n[0,1,0]\n\n[0,0,0]\n\nSumming all three matrices:\n\nRow0 (from row0 and row2):\n\n0+0=0, 1+1=2, 0+0=0 \u2192 [0,2,0]\n\nRow1 (from row0 and row2):\n\n0+0=0, 1+1=2, 0+0=0 \u2192 [0,2,0]\n\nRow2 (from row1):\n\n[0,0,0] + [0,0,0] + [1,1,1] \u2192 [1,1,1]\n\nBut the actual output for Example1 is:\n\n[0,2,0]\n\n[0,0,2]\n\n[0,2,0]\n\nThis doesn't match. Wait, maybe there's a different way to compute it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each output cell (i,j) is the number of times left[i] and right[j] are both 1 in the same row. Let's test this.\n\nFor Example0:\n\nRow0: left has 1 at i=0. Right has 1 at j=1. So (0,1) \u2192 count +=1.\n\nRow1: left has 1 at i=1. Right has 1s at j=0,1,2. So (1,0), (1,1), (1,2) each get +1.\n\nRow2: left has 1 at i=0. Right has no 1s. So no counts.\n\nTotal counts:\n\n(0,1) \u21921\n\n(1,0) \u21921\n\n(1,1) \u21921\n\n(1,2) \u21921\n\nSo output matrix would be:\n\nRow0: [0,1,0]\n\nRow1: [1,1,1]\n\nRow2: [0,0,0]\n\nBut the actual output for Example0 is:\n\n[0,0,0]\n\n[0,2,0]\n\n[0,0,0]\n\nSo this doesn't match. Hmm.\n\nWait, let's look at Example1's output again. The output has 2s in positions (0,1), (1,2), (2,1). Let's see how that could be formed.\n\nIn Example1's input:\n\nRow0: left [1,1,0], right [0,1,0]\n\nSo left has 1s at i=0 and i=1. Right has 1 at j=1. So (0,1) and (1,1) each contribute 1. So for row0, count +=2.\n\nRow1: left [0,0,1], right [1,1,1]. Left has 1 at i=2. Right has 1s at all j. So (2,0), (2,1), (2,2) each contribute 1. So row1 adds 3.\n\nRow2 is same as row0, so another 2.\n\nSo total counts:\n\n(0,1) \u21921 (from row0) +0 (row1) +1 (row2) \u2192 total 2.\n\n(1,1) \u21921 (from row0) +0 (row1) +1 (row2) \u2192 total 2.\n\n(2,0) \u21920 +1 (from row1) +0 \u21921.\n\n(2,1) \u21920 +1 \u21921.\n\n(2,2) \u21920 +1 \u21921.\n\nBut the output has [0,2,0] in row0, which would correspond to (0,1) being 2. That matches. Then row1 has [0,0,2], which would be (1,2) being 2. How does that happen? According to our current approach, (1,2) would have contributions from row1 and row2. Wait, in row0 and row2, the left is [1,1,0], which for i=1 (left[i]=1), and right[j=2] in row0 and row2 is 0. So no contribution. For row1, left[i=2], right[j=2] is 1. So (2,2) gets 1. But in Example1's output, the third row is [0,2,0], which is (2,1) =2. So this approach isn't matching.\n\nAlternative idea: Maybe the output matrix is formed by taking each input row's left and right parts, and for each position where the left part has a 1 and the right part has a 1 in the same index (modulo length?), then increment the corresponding output cell. Wait, but left is 3 elements and right is 3 elements. So for each input row, for each index k (0,1,2), if left[k] and right[k] are both 1, then increment output[row][k] by 1.\n\nLet's test this for Example1.\n\nInput row0: left [1,1,0], right [0,1,0]. For k=0: 1 and 0 \u2192 no. k=1:1 and1 \u2192 yes. So output[0][1] +=1.\n\nk=2:0 and0 \u2192 no. So row0 contributes +1 to output[0][1].\n\nRow1: left [0,0,1], right [1,1,1]. For k=0:0 and1 \u2192 no. k=1:0 and1 \u2192 no. k=2:1 and1 \u2192 yes. So output[1][2] +=1.\n\nRow2: same as row0, so output[0][1] +=1 again.\n\nTotal output:\n\nRow0: [0,2,0] (from two contributions)\n\nRow1: [0,0,1] from row1's contribution. But in the output, row1 is [0,0,2]. Hmm, so that's not matching. Unless there's a third contribution. Wait, maybe each row in the input contributes to the same row in the output. So row0 of input affects row0 of output, row1 affects row1 of output, row2 affects row2 of output.\n\nIn Example1's input:\n\nRow0: contributes +1 to output[0][1].\n\nRow1: contributes +1 to output[1][2].\n\nRow2: contributes +1 to output[2][1].\n\nSo output would be:\n\n[0,1,0]\n\n[0,0,1]\n\n[0,1,0]\n\nBut the actual output is:\n\n[0,2,0]\n\n[0,0,2]\n\n[0,2,0]\n\nSo this approach also doesn't fit. Hmm.\n\nLet's try to look for another pattern. Maybe the output matrix is the sum of the element-wise products between each row's left and right parts, but arranged in a certain way. For example, if the left part is a row vector and the right is a column vector, their product would be a matrix. But adding all three such matrices.\n\nWait, let's try this with Example1:\n\nRow0 left: [1,1,0], right: [0,1,0]. The product of left (row) and right (column) would be a 3x3 matrix. For example:\n\n1*0 + 1*1 + 0*0 =1 (for row0, column0).\n\nWait, no, the outer product is different. The outer product of a row vector (left) and column vector (right) would be a 3x3 matrix where each element (i,j) is left[i] * right[j]. Which is the same as before. Then summing all such matrices for each row.\n\nBut in Example1, the sum would be:\n\nRow0's matrix:\n\n[1*0, 1*1, 1*0] \u2192 [0,1,0]\n\n[1*0, 1*1, 1*0] \u2192 [0,1,0]\n\n[0*0, 0*1, 0*0] \u2192 [0,0,0]\n\nRow1's matrix:\n\n[0*1, 0*1, 0*1] \u2192 [0,0,0]\n\n[0*1, 0*1, 0*1] \u2192 [0,0,0]\n\n[1*1, 1*1, 1*1] \u2192 [1,1,1]\n\nRow2's matrix is same as row0's.\n\nSo sum all three:\n\nRow0 matrices:\n\nRow0:0+0=0, 1+0+1=2 (wait, no, row0's contribution from row0 and row2. Row0's matrix has first row [0,1,0], row2's matrix (same as row0) adds again [0,1,0]. So first row sum is [0+0,1+1,0+0] \u2192 [0,2,0].\n\nRow1 matrices:\n\nRow0's matrix's second row is [0,1,0], row1's second row is [0,0,0], row2's second row is [0,1,0]. Sum is [0,1+0+1=2, 0].\n\nRow2 matrices:\n\nRow0's third row is [0,0,0], row1's third row is [1,1,1], row2's third row is [0,0,0]. Sum is [1,1,1].\n\nSo the total matrix would be:\n\n[0,2,0]\n\n[0,2,0]\n\n[1,1,1]\n\nBut the actual output is:\n\n[0,2,0]\n\n[0,0,2]\n\n[0,2,0]\n\nThis doesn't match. So this approach is incorrect.\n\nLet me think differently. Looking at the outputs, they have 0s and 2s. Maybe the transformation involves counting pairs of 1s in certain positions across the input rows.\n\nFor example, in Example0's output, the middle cell is 2. Perhaps this comes from two input rows where left and right have certain patterns. But there are three input rows. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each cell in the output matrix is the count of rows where the left part's i-th element is 1 and the right part's j-th element is 1, multiplied by 2. Or something like that.\n\nLooking at Example0's middle output cell (1,1) being 2. Let's check how many rows have left[1] =1 and right[1]=1.\n\nRow0: left[1]=0 \u2192 no.\n\nRow1: left[1]=1, right[1]=1 \u2192 yes.\n\nRow2: left[1]=0 \u2192 no.\n\nSo only one row. But the output is 2. Hmm. Not helpful.\n\nWait, but in Example1's output, the middle cell (1,1) is 0. Let's see. For Example1:\n\nRow0: left[1]=1, right[1]=1 \u2192 yes.\n\nRow1: left[1]=0 \u2192 no.\n\nRow2: left[1]=1, right[1]=1 \u2192 yes.\n\nSo two rows contribute. But the output for cell (1,1) is 0. So that's not it.\n\nHmm.\n\nLet me consider the Test Input to see if I can find any patterns once I understand the training examples.\n\nTest Input:\n\n[1,0,1,5,1,0,1]\n\n[0,1,0,5,1,0,1]\n\n[1,0,1,5,0,1,0]\n\nSo each row has 5 at position 3. Left parts are [1,0,1], [0,1,0], [1,0,1]. Right parts are [1,0,1], [1,0,1], [0,1,0].\n\nMaybe the output is formed by something like the sum of the left[i] * right[j] across all rows, but with some twist.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is a 3x3 matrix where each cell (i,j) is the number of times left[i] and right[j] are 1 in the same row, multiplied by 2.\n\nFor example, in Example0:\n\nRow1 has left[1] =1 and right[0,1,2] =1. So each of (1,0), (1,1), (1,2) would be 1, but multiplied by 2 gives 2. But the output's middle row is [0,2,0], so only the middle cell has 2. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each cell (i,j) is twice the number of rows where left[i] and right[j] are 1. Let's check Example1.\n\nExample1's output has [0,2,0] in the first row. For cell (0,1): how many rows have left[0]=1 and right[1]=1?\n\nRow0: left[0]=1, right[1]=1 \u2192 yes.\n\nRow2: left[0]=1, right[1]=1 \u2192 yes. So two rows. So 2*1=2. This matches the cell (0,1) being 2. Similarly, cell (1,2) would be the number of rows where left[1] and right[2] are 1.\n\nRow1: left[1]=0 \u2192 no.\n\nRow0: left[1]=1, right[2]=0 \u2192 no.\n\nRow2: same as row0. So no rows. But in Example1's output, row1 is [0,0,2], so cell (1,2) is 2. Hmm. That doesn't fit. So this approach is incorrect.\n\nWait, but in Example1's output, cell (1,2) is 2. Let's check if any row has left[1] and right[2] =1.\n\nRow0: left[1]=1, right[2]=0 \u2192 no.\n\nRow1: left[1]=0, right[2]=1 \u2192 no.\n\nRow2: same as row0. So no. So this doesn't make sense. So this approach isn't working.\n\nAlternative idea: Looking at the outputs, perhaps each cell (i,j) in the output is the sum of the product of left[i] and right[j] for all three input rows. Let's test this.\n\nFor Example0's output:\n\nRow0 of output is [0,0,0].\n\nCell (0,0): sum over all input rows' left[0] * right[0].\n\nInput rows:\n\nRow0: left[0] =1, right[0] =0 \u2192 0.\n\nRow1: left[0] =0, right[0] =1 \u2192 0.\n\nRow2: left[0] =1, right[0] =0 \u2192 0.\n\nSum 0 \u2192 cell (0,0) is 0.\n\nCell (0,1): sum of left[0] * right[1] across rows.\n\nRow0:1*1=1.\n\nRow1:0*1=0.\n\nRow2:1*0=0.\n\nSum 1 \u2192 cell (0,1) is 1. But output's first row is [0,0,0]. So this doesn't match.\n\nHmm.\n\nLet me look back at the outputs. Example0's output has all zeros except for a 2 in the middle. Example1's output has 2s in certain positions. Example2's output has 2s in (1,0) and (2,2).\n\nMaybe the output is counting the number of times left and right parts have 1s in positions corresponding to the output's cell indices. For example, for cell (i,j) in the output, count the number of input rows where left[i] is 1 and right[j] is 1, then multiply by 2.\n\nBut in Example0's cell (1,1), there's one such row (row1: left[1]=1, right[1]=1). Multiply by 2 gives 2. That matches. Example1's cell (0,1) has two rows (row0 and row2) where left[0]=1 and right[1]=1 \u2192 2*1=2. Similarly, cell (1,2) would have two rows? Let's check.\n\nExample1's cell (1,2): left[1] =1 in which rows? Row0 and row2 have left[1]=1. For those rows, right[2] is 0 (row0) and 0 (row2). So no. So how does cell (1,2) in Example1's output become 2?\n\nWait, in Example1's output, the middle row is [0,0,2]. So cell (1,2) is 2. So according to this hypothesis, there are two input rows where left[1]=1 and right[2]=1. But in Example1's input:\n\nRow0: left[1]=1, right[2]=0 \u2192 no.\n\nRow1: left[1]=0, right[2]=1 \u2192 no.\n\nRow2: same as row0 \u2192 no. So this doesn't add up. So hypothesis invalid.\n\nAlternative approach: Let's think about the outputs and inputs in terms of the sum of certain elements. For example, in Example0's output, the middle cell is 2. Maybe it's the sum of the right parts of all rows where the middle element of the left part is 1. Let's see.\n\nExample0's middle input row has left[1] =1. The right part sum is 3. But output is 2. Doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output cell (i,j) is the sum of the j-th element of the right part in all rows where the i-th element of the left part is 1.\n\nFor Example0:\n\nCell (1,1): sum of right[1] of all rows where left[1] =1.\n\nLooking at all input rows:\n\nRow0: left[1] =0 \u2192 no.\n\nRow1: left[1] =1 \u2192 right[1]=1.\n\nRow2: left[1]=0 \u2192 no.\n\nSum is 1 \u2192 output is 2. So maybe multiply by 2. 1*2=2. That matches.\n\nExample1's cell (0,1): sum of right[1] of rows where left[0] =1.\n\nIn Example1's input:\n\nRow0: left[0]=1 \u2192 right[1]=1.\n\nRow2: left[0]=1 \u2192 right[1]=1.\n\nSum is 2 \u2192 multiplied by 1 gives 2. So output is 2. This matches.\n\nExample1's cell (1,2): sum of right[2] of rows where left[1] =1.\n\nLeft[1] =1 in row0 and row2.\n\nRow0: right[2]=0.\n\nRow2: right[2]=0.\n\nSum is 0 \u2192 output is 0, but the actual cell is 2. So this doesn't work.\n\nWait, in Example1's output, cell (1,2) is 2. According to this hypothesis, it should be the sum of right[2] where left[1] is 1. But in the input rows, left[1] is 1 in row0 and row2, and their right[2] are 0. So sum is 0. So this doesn't explain the 2.\n\nHmm. But the actual output for Example1 has [0,0,2] in the middle row. So cell (1,2) is 2. What's left[1] in the rows? row0 and row2 have left[1]=1. So perhaps the sum is of right[2] from those rows. But both are 0. So this approach isn't valid.\n\nAlternative idea: Maybe each output cell (i,j) is the sum of the left[i] * right[j] across all input rows, multiplied by 2.\n\nFor Example0's cell (1,1):\n\nsum across rows of left[1] * right[1]:\n\nRow0:0*1=0.\n\nRow1:1*1=1.\n\nRow2:0*0=0.\n\nSum=1 \u2192 multiplied by 2 gives 2. Which matches the output.\n\nExample1's cell (0,1):\n\nsum of left[0] * right[1] across rows:\n\nRow0:1*1=1.\n\nRow1:0*1=0.\n\nRow2:1*1=1.\n\nSum=2 \u2192 multiplied by 1 gives 2. Which matches.\n\nExample1's cell (1,2):\n\nsum of left[1] * right[2] across rows:\n\nRow0:1*0=0.\n\nRow1:0*1=0.\n\nRow2:1*0=0.\n\nSum=0 \u2192 multiplied by 2 would give 0. But the output for cell (1,2) is 2. So this doesn't fit. So this approach is incorrect.\n\nHmm. This is tricky. Let's look at Example2's input and output.\n\nExample2's input:\n\nRow0: [0,0,1,5,0,0,0] \u2192 left [0,0,1], right [0,0,0]\n\nRow1: [1,1,0,5,1,0,1] \u2192 left [1,1,0], right [1,0,1]\n\nRow2: [0,1,1,5,1,0,1] \u2192 left [0,1,1], right [1,0,1]\n\nOutput:\n\n[0,0,0]\n\n[2,0,0]\n\n[0,0,2]\n\nLet's see the output's cell (1,0) is 2. How is this derived?\n\nUsing the previous hypothesis of sum of left[i] * right[j] across rows:\n\nFor cell (1,0): sum left[1] * right[0] across all rows.\n\nRow0: left[1]=0 * right[0]=0 \u2192 0.\n\nRow1: left[1]=1 * right[0]=1 \u2192 1.\n\nRow2: left[1]=1 * right[0]=1 \u21921.\n\nSum is 2. So cell (1,0) is 2. Which matches the output.\n\nCell (2,2) in Example2's output is 2. sum of left[2] * right[2] across rows:\n\nRow0:1*0=0.\n\nRow1:0*1=0.\n\nRow2:1*1=1.\n\nSum is 1. So why is the output 2?\n\nHmm, this doesn't fit. But according to the output, cell (2,2) is 2. So this approach doesn't explain it.\n\nWait, in Example2's row2, left is [0,1,1], right [1,0,1]. left[2]=1, right[2]=1 \u2192 product is 1. But the sum across rows would be 1 (from row2) only. So why output is 2?\n\nUnless I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps the output is the sum of left[i] * right[j] for each row, but multiplied by 2 if the row's fourth element (the 5) has a certain condition. But in all inputs, the fourth element is 5. So that's probably not.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output cell (i,j) is the sum of left[i] XOR right[j] across all rows. But in Example0's cell (1,1):\n\nRow0:0 XOR1=1.\n\nRow1:1 XOR1=0.\n\nRow2:0 XOR0=0.\n\nSum 1. Not 2.\n\nNo, this doesn't fit.\n\nLet me think differently. Let's look for any other patterns in the outputs. \n\nExample0's output has a 2 in the middle of the middle row. Example1's output has 2s forming a diagonal from top-middle to middle-right to bottom-middle. Example2's output has 2s in the middle row's first position and bottom row's last position.\n\nHmm. Maybe the output is the sum of the products of the left and right vectors for each row, but the product is treated as a matrix where each row is left vector and each column is right vector. Then, the output is the sum of these matrices, but only where the row index of the input corresponds to the output's row.\n\nWait, perhaps for each input row, the left part is a column vector and the right part is a row vector. Their product is a 3x3 matrix. The output is the sum of these matrices for each input row. Then, each output cell (i,j) is the sum over all input rows of left[i] * right[j].\n\nLet's test this for Example0.\n\nInput rows:\n\nRow0: left [1,0,0], right [0,1,0]\n\nMatrix:\n\n1*0, 1*1, 1*0 \u2192 [0,1,0]\n\n0*0, 0*1, 0*0 \u2192 [0,0,0]\n\n0*0, 0*1, 0*0 \u2192 [0,0,0]\n\nRow1: left [0,1,0], right [1,1,1]\n\nMatrix:\n\n0*1, 0*1, 0*1 \u2192 [0,0,0]\n\n1*1, 1*1, 1*1 \u2192 [1,1,1]\n\n0*1, 0*1, 0*1 \u2192 [0,0,0]\n\nRow2: left [1,0,0], right [0,0,0]\n\nMatrix: all zeros.\n\nSumming all three matrices:\n\nRow0: 0+0+0=0, 1+0+0=1, 0+0+0=0 \u2192 [0,1,0]\n\nRow1: 0+1+0=1, 0+1+0=1, 0+1+0=1 \u2192 [1,1,1]\n\nRow2: 0+0+0=0, 0+0+0=0, 0+0+0=0 \u2192 [0,0,0]\n\nBut the actual output for Example0 is:\n\n[0,0,0]\n\n[0,2,0]\n\n[0,0,0]\n\nThis doesn't match. So this approach is incorrect.\n\nBut in Example0's output, the middle cell is 2, which would require the sum to be 2. How? Maybe the product is left[i] * right[j] multiplied by the number of rows. For example, sum across rows left[i] * right[j] * row_count. But that's not clear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output matrix is twice the sum of the products of left[i] and right[j] across all rows. Let's check Example0's middle cell (1,1):\n\nSum is 1 (from row1: left[1]=1 * right[1]=1). Twice that is 2, which matches. Example1's cell (0,1) sum is 1 (row0) +1 (row2) =2. Twice is 4, but output is 2. So this doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. This is frustrating. Let's think of another angle.\n\nLooking at Example0's input and output:\n\nInput rows:\n\nRow0: [1,0,0,5,0,1,0]\n\nRow1: [0,1,0,5,1,1,1]\n\nRow2: [1,0,0,5,0,0,0]\n\nOutput:\n\n[0,0,0]\n\n[0,2,0]\n\n[0,0,0]\n\nThe output has a 2 in the middle of the middle row. So maybe this corresponds to row1 of the input. The right part of row1 is [1,1,1], and the left part is [0,1,0]. The 1 in the middle of the left part. Maybe the output's middle row is generated by taking the left part's middle element (1) and multiplying it by the sum of the right part (3), but then 1*3=3, but output is 2. So maybe some other operation.\n\nAlternatively, the output cell (i,j) is the number of times the j-th element of the right part is 1 in the input rows where the i-th element of the left part is 1. So for Example0's cell (1,1):\n\nHow many times is right[1] 1 in rows where left[1] is 1.\n\nRow1: left[1] is 1, right[1] is 1 \u2192 yes. So count 1. But output is 2. So no.\n\nExample1's cell (0,1): rows where left[0] is 1 \u2192 row0 and row2. right[1] in those rows is 1 (both cases). So count 2. Output is 2. This fits. Cell (1,2) in Example1's output: rows where left[1] is 1 \u2192 row0 and row2. right[2] is 0 in both. So count 0. But output is 2. Doesn't fit.\n\nBut the output for Example1's cell (1,2) is 2. This approach doesn't explain that.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps each output cell (i,j) is the number of input rows where left[i] is 1 and right[j] is 1, but multiplied by the number of such rows. For example, if two rows meet the condition, then 2. But in Example0's cell (1,1), it's 1 row \u2192 1, but output is 2. So no.\n\nAlternatively, it's the count multiplied by 2. Example0's cell (1,1) would be 1 *2=2. Example1's cell (0,1) is 2 *1=2. Example1's cell (1,2) is 0*2=0, but output is 2. So this doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. I'm stuck. Let's try to think of the Test Input and see if I can find a pattern.\n\nTest Input:\n\nRow0: left [1,0,1], right [1,0,1]\n\nRow1: left [0,1,0], right [1,0,1]\n\nRow2: left [1,0,1], right [0,1,0]\n\nPossible output based on earlier hypotheses:\n\nIf the output is sum of left[i] * right[j] across all rows:\n\nFor cell (0,0): (1*1) + (0*1) + (1*0) =1 +0 +0=1.\n\nCell (0,1): (1*0) + (0*0) + (1*1) \u21920+0+1=1.\n\nCell (0,2):1*1 +0*1 +1*0 \u21921+0+0=1.\n\nRow0 of output: [1,1,1].\n\nSimilarly for other rows. But this doesn't match the examples. So not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, if each cell is twice the count of rows where left[i] and right[j] are 1.\n\nFor cell (0,0):\n\nRows where left[0] and right[0] are 1:\n\nRow0: left[0]=1, right[0]=1 \u2192 yes.\n\nRow1: left[0]=0 \u2192 no.\n\nRow2: left[0]=1, right[0]=0 \u2192 no.\n\nCount is 1 \u2192 2*1=2.\n\nCell (0,1):\n\nRows where left[0] and right[1] are 1:\n\nRow0: right[1]=0 \u2192 no.\n\nRow1: left[0]=0 \u2192 no.\n\nRow2: right[1]=1 \u2192 left[0]=1 \u2192 yes.\n\nCount 1 \u2192 2.\n\nBut according to the training examples, this may result in 2 in certain cells. But how does this fit with the examples.\n\nExample0's cell (1,1): count 1 \u2192 2. Which matches. Example1's cell (0,1): count 2 \u21924, but output is 2. So this doesn't fit.\n\nHmm.\n\nAt this point, I'm not making progress. Maybe the pattern is that the output is a 3x3 matrix where each cell (i,j) is twice the number of times left[i] and right[j] are 1 in the same row. Let's test this.\n\nExample0's cell (1,1): occurs once \u2192 2*1=2. Correct.\n\nExample1's cell (0,1): occurs twice \u2192 2*2=4. But output is 2. No.\n\nExample1's cell (1,2): occurs zero times \u2192 0. But output is 2. So no.\n\nBut maybe it's the count, not multiplied by anything. Example0's cell (1,1) would be 1, but output is 2. So no.\n\nI think I'm missing something. Let's look for another approach.\n\nWait, maybe the output is a 3x3 matrix where each cell (i,j) is the sum of the i-th element of the left part and the j-th element of the right part for each row, then multiplied by some factor.\n\nFor example, for each row, compute left[i] + right[j], then sum across rows.\n\nExample0's cell (1,1):\n\nRow0: left[1]=0 + right[1]=1 \u21921.\n\nRow1: left[1]=1 + right[1]=1 \u21922.\n\nRow2: left[1]=0 + right[1]=0 \u21920.\n\nSum 1+2+0=3. Output is 2. No.\n\nAlternatively, multiply by the left[i] + right[j]. Not sure.\n\nAnother idea: Maybe the output matrix is formed by the sum of the right part where the left part's corresponding position is 1. For example, for each input row, if the left[i] is 1, then add the right part's elements to the output's i-th row.\n\nFor Example0's input:\n\nRow0: left[0]=1 \u2192 add right part [0,1,0] to output row0.\n\nRow1: left[1]=1 \u2192 add right part [1,1,1] to output row1.\n\nRow2: left[0]=1 \u2192 add [0,0,0] to output row0.\n\nSo output would be:\n\nRow0: [0+0, 1+0, 0+0] \u2192 [0,1,0] (from row0 and row2's right parts).\n\nRow1: [1,1,1].\n\nRow2: nothing added.\n\nBut the actual output is different.\n\nAlternatively, if we add the right part's elements to the output row corresponding to the left part's position. For example, if left[i] is 1, add the right part to output[i]th row.\n\nExample0:\n\nRow0: left[0]=1 \u2192 add [0,1,0] to output row0.\n\nRow1: left[1]=1 \u2192 add [1,1,1] to output row1.\n\nRow2: left[0]=1 \u2192 add [0,0,0] to output row0.\n\nSo output rows:\n\nRow0: 0+0+0=0, 1+0=1, 0+0=0 \u2192 [0,1,0].\n\nRow1: [1,1,1].\n\nRow2: [0,0,0].\n\nBut the actual output for Example0 is [0,0,0], [0,2,0], [0,0,0]. This doesn't match.\n\nHmm.\n\nAnother approach: Let's look for a pattern in the output's positions and see if they relate to the input's left and right parts.\n\nExample0's output middle cell is 2. Input row1's right part is [1,1,1], and left part's middle element is 1. Perhaps the sum of the right part where left part's middle element is 1 is 3, but output is 2. Not sure.\n\nExample1's output has 2s in positions that form a diagonal. Maybe it's related to the sum of the right parts where the left parts have 1s in a certain pattern.\n\nAt this point, I'm not making progress. Let me try to see the Test Input and think about possible outputs based on the examples.\n\nTest Input:\n\nRow0: left [1,0,1], right [1,0,1]\n\nRow1: left [0,1,0], right [1,0,1]\n\nRow2: left [1,0,1], right [0,1,0]\n\nAssuming the pattern is that each cell (i,j) is the sum of left[i] * right[j] across all rows:\n\nCell (0,0):\n\n(1*1) + (0*1) + (1*0) =1 +0 +0=1.\n\nCell (0,1):\n\n(1*0) + (0*0) + (1*1) =0+0+1=1.\n\nCell (0,2):\n\n(1*1) + (0*1) + (1*0) =1+0+0=1.\n\nRow0: [1,1,1]\n\nCell (1,0):\n\n(0*1) + (1*1) + (0*0) =0+1+0=1.\n\nCell (1,1):\n\n(0*0) + (1*0) + (0*1) =0+0+0=0.\n\nCell (1,2):\n\n(0*1) + (1*1) + (0*0) =0+1+0=1.\n\nRow1: [1,0,1]\n\nCell (2,0):\n\n(1*1) + (0*1) + (1*0) =1+0+0=1.\n\nCell (2,1):\n\n(1*0) + (0*0) + (1*1) =0+0+1=1.\n\nCell (2,2):\n\n(1*1) + (0*1) + (1*0) =1+0+0=1.\n\nRow2: [1,1,1]\n\nSo the output matrix would be:\n\n[1,1,1]\n\n[1,0,1]\n\n[1,1,1]\n\nBut looking at the training examples, their outputs have 0s and 2s, not 1s. So this doesn't fit. Therefore, this approach is incorrect.\n\nAnother idea: Maybe each cell (i,j) is the count of rows where left[i] and right[j] are 1, multiplied by 2. Let's try this for the Test Input.\n\nFor cell (0,0):\n\nRows where left[0]=1 and right[0]=1 \u2192 row0 and row2. row0: left[0]=1, right[0]=1 \u2192 yes. row2: left[0]=1, right[0]=0 \u2192 no. So count is 1 \u2192 2*1=2.\n\nCell (0,1):\n\nRows where left[0]=1 and right[1]=1 \u2192 row2 has right[1]=1 \u2192 count 1 \u2192 2.\n\nCell (0,2): row0 and row2 have right[2]=1 and 0 respectively. row0: right[2]=1 \u2192 yes. So count 1 \u2192 2.\n\nSo row0: [2,2,2].\n\nRow1:\n\nCell (1,0): rows where left[1]=1 and right[0]=1 \u2192 row1: left[1]=1, right[0]=1 \u2192 yes. So count 1 \u2192 2.\n\nCell (1,1): left[1]=1 and right[1]=1 \u2192 row1's right[1]=0 \u2192 no. So 0.\n\nCell (1,2): left[1]=1 and right[2]=1 \u2192 row1's right[2]=1 \u2192 yes. So count 1 \u21922.\n\nRow1: [2,0,2].\n\nRow2:\n\nCell (2,0): rows where left[2]=1 and right[0]=1 \u2192 row0 and row2. row0: left[2]=1, right[0]=1 \u2192 yes. row2: left[2]=1, right[0]=0 \u2192 no. So count 1 \u21922.\n\nCell (2,1): left[2]=1 and right[1]=1 \u2192 row2: right[1]=1 \u2192 yes. So count 1 \u21922.\n\nCell (2,2): left[2]=1 and right[2]=1 \u2192 row0: right[2]=1 \u2192 yes. row2: right[2]=0 \u2192 no. So count 1 \u21922.\n\nRow2: [2,2,2].\n\nSo the output matrix would be:\n\n[2,2,2]\n\n[2,0,2]\n\n[2,2,2]\n\nBut this doesn't match the training examples' outputs, which have varying positions of 2s. So this approach is likely incorrect.\n\nAt this point, I'm stuck. Given the time I've spent and the lack of progress, I'll have to make an educated guess based on the examples.\n\nLooking at Example0's output: the middle row has a 2. The input row1 has left [0,1,0] and right [1,1,1]. The 5 is in position3. The output cell (1,1) is 2. Maybe the output is the sum of the right part where the left part's corresponding index is 1. For example, in row1's left part, index1 is 1. Sum the right part's elements where their index equals the left's index. So for row1, left's index1 is 1, sum right[1] =1. But output is 2. So multiply by 2. 1*2=2. \n\nExample1's output has cell (0,1) as 2. In row0's left part, index0 is 1, sum right[0] =0. No. Alternatively, sum all right elements where left's index is 1. For Example0's row1, left[1]=1, sum all right elements (3) \u21923* something=2. Not sure.\n\nAnother possibility: the output is the count of 1s in the right part of rows where the left part has a 1 in the same position as the output cell's row. For example, output cell (i,j) is the number of times right[j] is 1 in rows where left[i] is 1.\n\nFor Example0's cell (1,1):\n\nCount of rows where left[1]=1 and right[1]=1 \u2192 only row1. So count is 1. Output is 2. So multiply by 2.\n\nExample1's cell (0,1): rows where left[0]=1 and right[1]=1 \u2192 row0 and row2. count=2 \u2192 output 2.\n\nExample1's cell (1,2): rows where left[1]=1 and right[2]=1 \u2192 row0's right[2]=0, row2's right[2]=0 \u2192 count 0. But output is 2. So no.\n\nHmm. But this doesn't explain Example1's cell (1,2).\n\nGiven the time I've spent and the lack of progress, I'll proceed with the hypothesis that each cell (i,j) is twice the count of rows where left[i] and right[j] are both 1. For the test input, this would give:\n\nTest Input:\n\nRow0: left [1,0,1], right [1,0,1]\n\nRow1: left [0,1,0], right [1,0,1]\n\nRow2: left [1,0,1], right [0,1,0]\n\nFor each cell (i,j):\n\ncell (0,0): rows where left[0] and right[0] are 1 \u2192 row0. Count=1 \u2192 2*1=2.\n\ncell (0,1): rows where left[0] and right[1] are 1 \u2192 row0's right[1]=0, row2's right[1]=1. So left[0] is 1 in row0 and row2. row0's right[1]=0, row2's right[1]=1 \u2192 only row2 qualifies. Count=1 \u2192 2.\n\ncell (0,2): rows where left[0] and right[2] are 1 \u2192 row0 (right[2]=1), row2 (right[2]=0). Count=1 \u21922.\n\ncell (1,0): rows where left[1] and right[0] are 1 \u2192 row1's left[1]=1, right[0]=1. So count=1 \u21922.\n\ncell (1,1): rows where left[1] and right[1] are 1 \u2192 row1's right[1]=0 \u2192 no. row2's left[1]=0. So count=0 \u21920.\n\ncell (1,2): rows where left[1] and right[2] are 1 \u2192 row1's right[2]=1, left[1]=1 \u2192 count=1 \u21922.\n\ncell (2,0): rows where left[2] and right[0] are 1 \u2192 row0's left[2]=1, right[0]=1 \u2192 yes. row2's left[2]=1, right[0]=0 \u2192 no. Count=1 \u21922.\n\ncell (2,1): rows where left[2] and right[1] are 1 \u2192 row0's right[1]=0, row2's right[1]=1 \u2192 row2's left[2]=1 \u2192 count=1 \u21922.\n\ncell (2,2): rows where left[2] and right[2] are 1 \u2192 row0's right[2]=1, left[2]=1 \u2192 yes. row2's right[2]=0 \u2192 no. Count=1 \u21922.\n\nSo the output matrix would be:\n\n[2,2,2]\n\n[2,0,2]\n\n[2,2,2]\n\nBut none of the training examples have all 2s. So this must be incorrect. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps only the middle row's cells are doubled. But I'm not sure.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and the need to provide an answer, I'll make a guess based on Example0, where the middle row's middle cell is 2, which corresponds to the input row where left has a 1 in the middle and right has 1s. Maybe the output is the sum of the right part's elements where the left part's middle element is 1. For example, in Example0's middle row, sum of right part (3) multiplied by left middle (1), but why 2? Not sure.\n\nFinally, after struggling, I think the pattern is that each output cell (i,j) is twice the number of rows where the left part's i-th element is 1 and the right part's j-th element is 1. So for Example0's cell (1,1), there's 1 row (row1), so 2*1=2. For Example1's cell (0,1), two rows (row0 and row2), so 2*2=4, but output is 2. This contradicts. So perhaps it's just the count, not multiplied by anything. But then Example0's cell would be 1, but output is 2.\n\nWait, perhaps the output is the sum of left[i] XOR right[j] for all rows. For Example0's cell (1,1), 0 XOR1=1 (row0), 1 XOR1=0 (row1), 0 XOR0=0 (row2). Sum is 1. Output is 2. No. \n\nI think I've exhausted all possible approaches. Given the time constraints, I'll proceed with the hypothesis that the output is the sum of left[i] * right[j] across all rows, but I'll adjust the Test Input's output accordingly."
