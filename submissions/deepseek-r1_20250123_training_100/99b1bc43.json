        "cot_1": "Okay, I need to solve this puzzle where I have to figure out the pattern from the training examples and apply it to the test input. Let me start by carefully analyzing the given examples.\n\nFirst, let's look at the structure of the inputs and outputs. Each input consists of 9 rows of 4-element lists, and the output is 4 rows of 4-element lists. The numbers involved are 0, 1, 2, 3, 4. The outputs only contain 0 and 3. Hmm, so maybe the transformation converts some combination of the input numbers into 3s and 0s.\n\nLooking at Example 0's input and output. Let's see the input rows:\n\n[0, 1, 0, 1]\n[0, 0, 0, 1]\n[1, 0, 1, 0]\n[0, 0, 0, 1]\n[4, 4, 4, 4]  --> This is the fifth row.\nThen rows 5-8:\n[0, 2, 0, 2]\n[0, 0, 0, 2]\n[2, 0, 0, 2]\n[2, 2, 2, 0]\n\nThe output is four rows:\n[0, 0, 0, 0]\n[0, 0, 0, 0]\n[0, 0, 3, 3]\n[3, 3, 3, 3]\n\nNoticing that the fifth input row is [4,4,4,4]. Maybe this is a separator or a key. The output has four rows, which might correspond to the first four rows of the input, modified based on some rules involving the other rows.\n\nWait, but in Example 0, the input has 9 rows, and the output 4. So perhaps the output is generated from the rows after the [4,4,4,4] row. Let's check:\n\nIn Example 0, the input after the 4-row is four rows (indices 5-8), but the output is four rows. So maybe the output is processing the rows after the 4s. But the output rows here are four. Let's check each example.\n\nLooking at Example 0's input: after [4,4,4,4], there are 5 rows: indices 5 to 8 (since input is 9 rows). Wait, maybe the output is generated from the rows after the 4s. Let me count:\n\nFor example 0, after the 4 row (row 4), there are rows 5-8 (four rows). But the output has four rows. So maybe each output row corresponds to one of the rows after the 4s. But in the example, output rows are four. Hmm. Let's see.\n\nWait, in Example 0:\n\nInput rows after 4s are:\n\n5: [0,2,0,2]\n\n6: [0,0,0,2]\n\n7: [2,0,0,2]\n\n8: [2,2,2,0]\n\nOutput is four rows. So maybe each output row is a transformation of one of these rows. Let's compare.\n\nOutput row 0: [0,0,0,0]\n\nWhich input row after 4s is row 5: [0,2,0,2]. How does this become [0,0,0,0]? Hmm. Maybe the 2s are converted to 3s only under certain conditions, but here they are 0s. Alternatively, maybe other rows are involved in the transformation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output rows are combinations of the input rows, maybe XOR or some other operation between the first four rows and the rows after 4s. Let's see.\n\nWait, perhaps the 4-row acts as a separator. The input is divided into two parts: the first four rows, then the 4-row, then the next four rows. And the output is generated by combining these two parts. Let me check.\n\nIn Example 0, the first four input rows are:\n\n[0,1,0,1], [0,0,0,1], [1,0,1,0], [0,0,0,1]\n\nThen after the 4s, rows 5-8 (four rows). The output has four rows, perhaps each output row is derived from combining the first four and the next four rows.\n\nBut how? Let's take the first output row of Example 0: [0,0,0,0]. How is that derived from the first input rows?\n\nAlternatively, maybe each output row is generated by taking the rows after the 4s and applying some transformation. Let's look at Example 0's output:\n\nFirst output row: [0,0,0,0] \u2013 possibly corresponding to input row 5: [0,2,0,2]. If the 2s are turned into 0s here. But why?\n\nWait, but in Example 1's output, there are 3s. Let me check.\n\nExample 1's input after 4s:\n\n[0,2,2,2]\n\n[2,0,2,0]\n\n[2,2,2,2]\n\n[2,2,2,2]\n\nOutput:\n\n[3,0,3,3]\n\n[0,0,0,0]\n\n[0,0,3,0]\n\n[3,0,0,3]\n\nLooking at the first output row [3,0,3,3]. The corresponding input row after 4s is [0,2,2,2]. So maybe 2s are converted to 3s, but 0 remains 0? But then in Example 0's row 5: [0,2,0,2] would become [0,3,0,3], but the output is [0,0,0,0]. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the numbers from the first four rows and the rows after the 4s are combined. For example, maybe each output element is 3 if the sum of the corresponding elements in the first four rows and the post-4 rows is even, or something like that. Wait, but how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's a bitwise operation. Let's think in binary. 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 in binary are:\n\n0: 00\n\n1: 01\n\n2: 10\n\n3: 11\n\n4: 100 (but perhaps 4 is a separator and not part of the data)\n\nBut maybe each element in the output is determined by combining bits from the corresponding positions in the first four and the next four rows. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe each output row is a combination of two rows: one from the first group (before the 4s) and one from the second group (after the 4s), and some operation is applied.\n\nWait, in Example 0:\n\nThe first four input rows (group A) are:\n\nA1: [0,1,0,1]\n\nA2: [0,0,0,1]\n\nA3: [1,0,1,0]\n\nA4: [0,0,0,1]\n\nThe next four rows after the 4s (group B) are:\n\nB1: [0,2,0,2]\n\nB2: [0,0,0,2]\n\nB3: [2,0,0,2]\n\nB4: [2,2,2,0]\n\nThe output is four rows. Maybe each output row is a combination of a row from group A and a row from group B. For example, output row 1 is A1 and B1 combined. Let's see:\n\nIn Example 0's output row 3 is [3,3,3,3]. Let's see which input rows could lead to this. Maybe combining A4 and B4. Let's see A4 is [0,0,0,1], B4 is [2,2,2,0]. How could that result in all 3s?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is generated by looking at certain positions across the groups. Another approach: Let's look for patterns in individual elements.\n\nTake Example 0's output:\n\nFirst output row: [0,0,0,0]\n\nLooking at group B's first row (B1: [0,2,0,2]). Perhaps when a B element is even (like 0 or 2), and if the corresponding A element is 0, then the output is 0. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the presence of a 2 in group B and a certain value in group A leads to a 3. Let's see.\n\nIn Example 1's output first row: [3,0,3,3]. The corresponding group B row is [0,2,2,2]. So B elements here are 0,2,2,2. Group A's first row is [1,1,0,0]. So for the first element, B is 0 and A is 1, output is 3. Second element B is 2, A is 1, output 0. Third B is 2, A is 0 \u2192 3. Fourth B is 2, A is 0 \u21923. Hmm, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is 3 if the sum of the elements in the same position across all group A and group B rows is even, or odd, or meets some condition. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 4-row indicates that the rows after are the ones to process, but how?\n\nWait, perhaps each output element is 3 if the corresponding element in group B (after 4s) is 2 and the same position in group A (before 4s) is 0. Or some combination. Let's test this.\n\nExample 0's output first row is [0,0,0,0]. Group B row 1 is [0,2,0,2]. For each element in this row:\n\nIf B is 0, output is 0. If B is 2, check group A's row. Let's see group A's first row is [0,1,0,1]. So in positions where B is 2 (positions 2 and 4), group A has 1 and 1. So maybe if B is 2 and group A is 1, output is 0. But that's what's happening here. But then, in Example 1's output first row, group B's row is [0,2,2,2]. Group A's first row is [1,1,0,0]. For the elements where B is 2 (positions 2,3,4?), group A's values are 1, 0, 0. The output is [3,0,3,3]. Hmm. So when B is 2 and A is 1 (position 2 in group B and A's row 1 is 1), output is 0. But when B is 2 and A is 0 (positions 3 and 4), output is 3. That seems possible.\n\nSo maybe the rule is: For each element in the group B rows (after 4s), if the value is 2, then check the corresponding element in the group A rows (before 4s). If the group A element is 0, then output is 3. If group A element is 1, output is 0. But group B can also have 0 or other numbers. Let's test this.\n\nIn Example 0's first output row [0,0,0,0], the group B row is [0,2,0,2]. For the 0s in B, output is 0. For the 2s in B, group A's first row has elements [0,1,0,1]. So positions where B is 2 are 2 and 4. In group A, those positions are 1 and 1. So according to the rule, 2 in B and 1 in A \u2192 0. So output for those positions would be 0. Hence, the entire row is 0s. That matches.\n\nIn Example 1's first output row [3,0,3,3], group B's first row is [0,2,2,2]. Group A's first row is [1,1,0,0]. Let's process each element:\n\nPosition 1: B=0 \u2192 output 0? But the first element is 3. Wait, that doesn't fit. So perhaps the rule is different.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is 3 when group B is 2 and group A is 0, but if group B is 2 and group A is 1, then output is 0. For B=0, maybe output depends on other factors. Wait, in Example 1's first output row, the first element is 3, but B is 0 here, so the rule I proposed wouldn't apply. So that's a problem.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is determined by combining the group A and group B rows in some way. Let's think of group A and group B as two sets of layers. For each position (i,j), output is 3 if there's a 2 in group B and a 0 in group A at the same position. But perhaps across multiple rows?\n\nWait, maybe for each position (column) in the output, we look at the corresponding column across all group A rows and group B rows and apply some logic.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each column in the output is derived from the same column across all group B rows, modified by the group A rows. But I'm not sure.\n\nAnother approach: Let's look at the positions where output is 3. Let's take Example 0's third output row [0,0,3,3]. The corresponding group B row is [2,0,0,2]. So in the third row of group B, elements are 2,0,0,2. The group A third row is [1,0,1,0]. For positions where B is 2 (positions 1 and 4), group A has 1 and 0. The output here is 0 and 3. So when B is 2 and A is 1 \u2192 0, B=2 and A=0 \u2192 3. That fits. So the rule could be: for each element in group B rows, if it's 2 and the corresponding element in the same position in group A is 0, then output 3. Otherwise, output 0. But group B can also have 0s, which would output 0. Let's check.\n\nIn Example 0's fourth output row [3,3,3,3], group B's fourth row is [2,2,2,0]. The group A fourth row is [0,0,0,1]. For positions 1-3 in B's fourth row: 2,2,2. The corresponding group A elements are 0,0,0. So all those would be 3s. The fourth position in B is 0, so output 0. But the output here is 3. Wait, this doesn't fit. The output row is [3,3,3,3], but according to the rule, the fourth element should be 0. So this contradicts.\n\nHmm. So the previous idea is incorrect. Maybe there's another pattern.\n\nWait, maybe group A is the first four rows, group B is the next four (after 4s). For each row in group B, we compare it to the corresponding row in group A. Let's take Example 0's group B rows:\n\nB1: [0,2,0,2] \u2192 output row [0,0,0,0]\n\nCompare to A1: [0,1,0,1]. Maybe for each element, if B's element is 2 and A's is 0 \u2192 3. Otherwise, 0. Let's see:\n\nIn B1, elements 0,2,0,2. A1 has 0,1,0,1.\n\nSo in positions where B is 2 and A is 1 \u2192 0. B is 2 and A is 0 \u2192 3? No, in B1's positions 2 and 4 (values 2), A1 has 1 and 1. So output would be 0. But the output for B1 is [0,0,0,0]. So maybe when B is 2 and A is 0 \u2192 3, else 0. But then in B1, positions 0 and 2: B is 0, so output 0. Positions 1 and 3: B is 2, A is 1 \u2192 0. So the output is all 0s. That matches.\n\nNow, B3 in Example 0: [2,0,0,2]. The output row is [0,0,3,3]. Let's compare to A3: [1,0,1,0]. For each element:\n\nPosition 0: B=2, A=1 \u2192 output 0.\n\nPosition 1: B=0 \u2192 0.\n\nPosition 2: B=0 \u2192 0.\n\nPosition 3: B=2, A=0 \u2192 3.\n\nWait, but output row is [0,0,3,3]. Hmm. So maybe the positions where B is 2 and A is 0 \u2192 3. Let's check B3: positions 0 and 3 have 2. A3's positions 0 and 3: 1 and 0. So position 0: B=2, A=1 \u2192 0. Position 3: B=2, A=0 \u2192 3. But the output row here has 3s in positions 2 and 3. So this doesn't fit. So my previous theory is incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is determined by summing the number of times a 2 appears in group B's rows for that position, but group A's rows have 0s. Let's think of it as for each column in the output, if the sum of 2s in group B's rows for that column equals the number of 0s in group A's rows for that column, then output 3. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each row in group B is transformed into the output row based on certain conditions. For example, in group B's row, every 2 is replaced with a 3, and 0 remains 0. But in Example 0's B1 row [0,2,0,2], that would become [0,3,0,3], but the output is all 0s. So that's not the case.\n\nAnother approach: Let's look at the sum of the elements in the input rows. For Example 0's output rows, the sums are 0, 0, 6, 12. Not sure if that helps.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the result of some kind of bitwise OR or AND between the group A and group B rows. For example, in Example 0's B1 row [0,2,0,2], group A's row 1 is [0,1,0,1]. If we perform some operation, like converting 2 to 3 (binary 10 to 11), but that's unclear.\n\nWait, perhaps the numbers in group B (after 4s) are 0,2. The output uses 0 and 3. So 2 becomes 3, and 0 stays 0. But in Example 0's B1 row [0,2,0,2], that would become [0,3,0,3], but the output is all 0s. So that's not the case.\n\nBut wait in Example 1's output first row [3,0,3,3], group B's first row is [0,2,2,2]. If 2 becomes 3, then [0,3,3,3], but the output is [3,0,3,3]. So first element is 3 instead of 0. So that's not matching.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is 3 when the corresponding element in group B is 2 and the sum of the same column in group A is even, or something. Let's take Example 0's B3 row [2,0,0,2]. The output row is [0,0,3,3]. Let's look at the columns for group A.\n\nGroup A's third row is [1,0,1,0]. So for column 0 in group A: values in rows 1-4 are 0,0,1,0 \u2192 sum is 1 (odd). For B3's first element (2), output is 0. For column 3 in group A: values are 1,1,0,1 \u2192 sum 3 (odd). B3's fourth element is 2 \u2192 output 3. So perhaps the sum parity doesn't matter here.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Let's think of another approach.\n\nLooking at the output rows for each example, they all have 0s and 3s. So the key is to figure out when to output a 3 and when to output 0.\n\nAnother idea: For each position (i,j) in the output, look at the corresponding position in the group B rows (after 4s). If any of the group B rows in that column has a 2, then output 3. But how does that work with multiple rows?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output rows are determined by merging the group B rows, replacing 2 with 3, but only if certain conditions from group A are met.\n\nWait, looking at Example 3's output:\n\n[3,3,0,0]\n[0,3,3,0]\n[0,3,3,3]\n[3,3,0,0]\n\nThe group B rows after 4s in Example 3's input are:\n\n[0,2,2,2]\n[0,2,2,2]\n[2,0,2,2]\n[2,2,2,2]\n\nSo group B rows have 2s. The output has 3s where group B has 2s, but maybe only if the corresponding group A element is 0.\n\nWait, group A in Example 3 is:\n\n[1,0,1,1]\n[0,0,0,1]\n[1,1,0,0]\n[0,0,1,1]\n\nLet's look at the first output row [3,3,0,0]. The corresponding group B row is [0,2,2,2]. So in positions where group B has 2s (columns 2,3,4?), but in group A's first row, those positions are 1,1,1. So according to the earlier idea, if group B is 2 and group A is 0 \u2192 3. But here group A's first row is 1, so output would be 0. But the output here is 3,3,0,0. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is determined by the presence of a 2 in any of the group B rows in that position, but only if the group A's row in the same position as the group B row has a 0. For example, for each group B row, if in that row's position, the group A row (same index) has a 0, then the output is 3 if group B is 2.\n\nWait, let's take Example 0's output row 3: [3,3,3,3]. This corresponds to group B's row 4 (index 8), which is [2,2,2,0]. The group A's row 4 is [0,0,0,1]. So for each position in group B's row 4, if group A's row 4 has 0, then 2 becomes 3, else 0. So positions 0-2 in group A's row 4 are 0, so B's 2s become 3s. Position 3 in group A's row 4 is 1, so B's 0 becomes 0. Thus, the output row would be [3,3,3,0]. But the actual output is [3,3,3,3]. So this doesn't fit.\n\nThis is really challenging. Maybe I should look for other patterns.\n\nLooking at the test input:\n\nTest Input:\n\n[1, 0, 1, 1]\n[0, 1, 1, 1]\n[0, 0, 1, 0]\n[1, 0, 1, 1]\n[4,4,4,4]\n[2,2,0,2]\n[0,0,2,0]\n[2,0,0,2]\n[0,2,0,2]\n\nSo the group A is the first four rows, group B is rows 5-8 (four rows). The output should have four rows.\n\nIn group B:\n\nRow 5: [2,2,0,2]\n\nRow 6: [0,0,2,0]\n\nRow 7: [2,0,0,2]\n\nRow 8: [0,2,0,2]\n\nNow, applying the earlier hypothesis where for each element in group B rows, if it's 2 and the corresponding group A element (same row and column) is 0, then output 3; otherwise 0.\n\nBut let's see. For group B row 5: [2,2,0,2]. Group A's row 1 is [1,0,1,1].\n\nSo columns 0: B=2, A=1 \u2192 0.\n\nColumn 1: B=2, A=0 \u2192 3.\n\nColumn 2: B=0 \u2192 0.\n\nColumn 3: B=2, A=1 \u2192 0.\n\nSo output row would be [0,3,0,0].\n\nBut let's check the training examples to see if this matches any pattern.\n\nIn Example 3's first output row [3,3,0,0], group B's row 5 is [0,2,2,2], group A's row 1 is [1,0,1,1]. According to the same rule:\n\nFor column 0: B=0 \u21920. But output is 3. So the rule doesn't hold.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the group A row corresponds to the same index as the group B row. For example, group B row 5 (index 5) is processed with group A row 1 (index 0)? No, because group A has four rows (0-3), group B has rows 5-8 (four rows). So maybe each group B row i (5-8) is paired with group A row (i-5). So row 5 in group B (index 5) pairs with group A row 0 (index 0). Row 6 pairs with group A row 1, etc.\n\nLet's test this with Example 0:\n\nGroup B row 5: [0,2,0,2] pairs with group A row 0: [0,1,0,1].\n\nSo for each element in B's row 5, if B is 2 and A is 0 \u2192 3, else 0.\n\nSo:\n\nColumn 0: B=0 \u21920.\n\nColumn 1: B=2, A=1 \u21920.\n\nColumn 2: B=0 \u21920.\n\nColumn 3: B=2, A=1 \u21920.\n\nSo output row is [0,0,0,0], which matches Example 0's first output row.\n\nNow, group B row 6 in Example 0 is [0,0,0,2], paired with group A row 1: [0,0,0,1].\n\nFor each element:\n\nColumn 3: B=2, A=1 \u21920. So output row [0,0,0,0], which matches Example 0's second output row.\n\nGroup B row 7: [2,0,0,2], paired with group A row 2: [1,0,1,0].\n\nColumns:\n\n0: B=2, A=1 \u21920.\n\n1: B=0 \u21920.\n\n2: B=0 \u21920.\n\n3: B=2, A=0 \u21923.\n\nSo output row [0,0,0,3]. But Example 0's third output row is [0,0,3,3]. Hmm, discrepancy here. So this doesn't fit. Wait, maybe there's another pattern.\n\nWait, in Example 0's group B row 7 is [2,0,0,2], paired with group A row 2: [1,0,1,0].\n\nIf the rule is: output 3 if group B is 2 and group A is 0 in the same position.\n\nColumns 0: B=2, A=1 \u21920.\n\nColumn 1: B=0 \u21920.\n\nColumn 2: B=0 \u21920.\n\nColumn 3: B=2, A=0 \u21923.\n\nSo the output row would be [0,0,0,3], but Example 0's third output row is [0,0,3,3]. So something's wrong.\n\nWait, maybe group B rows are paired with group A rows in a different way. For example, group B row 5 pairs with group A row 1, and group B row 6 with group A row 2, etc. But not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each group B row is paired with all group A rows, and the output is a combination.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is generated by checking for each position (column) in all group B rows. If there's a 2 in that column in any group B row, and the corresponding column in group A has a 0 in any row, then output 3. Otherwise 0.\n\nFor example, in Example 0's output row 3: [3,3,3,3]. Let's look at column 0. In group B, column 0 has 0,0,2,2. So there are 2s. In group A's column 0, do any rows have 0? Yes: rows 0,1,3. So output 3. Similarly for other columns.\n\nBut how does this produce four output rows? It would generate a single row. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each output row corresponds to a group B row, and each element in the output row is 3 if the group B's element is 2 and the corresponding group A's element in the same row and column is 0; otherwise 0. But this seems similar to the earlier approach, which didn't fit all cases.\n\nLet's recheck Example 0's third output row: [0,0,3,3].\n\nGroup B row 7: [2,0,0,2], paired with group A row 3: [0,0,0,1].\n\nColumns:\n\n0: B=2, A=0 \u21923.\n\n1: B=0 \u21920.\n\n2: B=0 \u21920.\n\n3: B=2, A=1 \u21920.\n\nSo output row would be [3,0,0,0], but the actual output is [0,0,3,3]. This doesn't fit.\n\nThis is getting frustrating. Maybe I need to look for a different pattern.\n\nAnother idea: Perhaps the output is a result of overlaying the group B rows, replacing 2s with 3s, but only where the corresponding group A rows have 0s. For example, if in any of the group B rows, a cell is 2, and in the corresponding group A row's cell, it's 0, then output 3. Otherwise 0. But how does this aggregate across multiple rows?\n\nAlternatively, each output row is formed by taking the corresponding group B row, replacing 2s with 3s where the same position in the group A row is 0, else 0. For example, for each group B row, for each element, if it's 2 and the corresponding group A's row's element (same position) is 0 \u21923, else 0.\n\nLet's test this with Example 0's group B row 5: [0,2,0,2], group A row 0: [0,1,0,1].\n\nSo:\n\n0: B is 0 \u21920.\n\n1: B=2, A=1 \u21920.\n\n2: B=0 \u21920.\n\n3: B=2, A=1 \u21920.\n\nOutput row: [0,0,0,0], which matches.\n\nGroup B row 6: [0,0,0,2], group A row 1: [0,0,0,1].\n\nFor position 3: B=2, A=1 \u21920. So output row [0,0,0,0].\n\nGroup B row 7: [2,0,0,2], group A row 2: [1,0,1,0].\n\nPosition 0: B=2, A=1 \u21920.\n\nPosition 3: B=2, A=0 \u21923.\n\nSo output row would be [0,0,0,3]. But the actual output row is [0,0,3,3].\n\nHmm, discrepancy here. So perhaps this isn't the correct pattern.\n\nWait, in Example 0's group B row 8: [2,2,2,0], group A row 3: [0,0,0,1].\n\nSo:\n\nPositions 0-2: B=2, A=0 \u21923 each.\n\nPosition 3: B=0 \u21920.\n\nOutput row would be [3,3,3,0], but the actual output row is [3,3,3,3]. So this doesn't fit.\n\nThis suggests that the pattern isn't simply comparing the group B row with the same-index group A row.\n\nAlternative approach: Let's look for the occurrence of 3s in the output and see what's common in the input.\n\nIn Example 0's third output row [0,0,3,3], the corresponding group B row is [2,0,0,2]. So where are the 3s in the output? Positions 2 and 3. Group B's row has 0s in those positions. Wait, no. B's row is [2,0,0,2], so positions 0 and 3 are 2. But the output has 3s in positions 2 and 3. That's confusing.\n\nWait, perhaps the output rows are transformed based on the group B rows but also considering the sum or other properties of group A's columns.\n\nAnother idea: For each column in the output, if there's a 2 in any of the group B rows in that column and the sum of group A's column is even, then output 3. Otherwise 0.\n\nLet's test this with Example 0's column 3. Group B has 2s in rows 5,6,7,8. Group A's column 3 sum is 1 + 1 +0 +1 =3 (odd). So output would be 0. But in Example 0's output row 3, column 3 is 3. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, if the sum of group A's column is even, then 3 is outputted where group B has 2s. Let's see:\n\nExample 0's column 3: sum is 3 (odd), so output would be 0. But output row 3 has 3 in column 3. So no.\n\nThis is really challenging. Maybe I should look for a different pattern, perhaps involving the position in the grid.\n\nWait, all the output examples have four rows. The input after the 4-row has four rows. Maybe each output row is generated by looking at the corresponding row in group B and some combination with group A.\n\nFor example, output row 0 is generated by group B row 5 and group A rows. Let's see.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by rotating or shifting the group B rows in a certain way. For example, rotating left or right. But looking at Example 0's group B rows:\n\n[0,2,0,2]\n[0,0,0,2]\n[2,0,0,2]\n[2,2,2,0]\n\nOutput:\n\n[0,0,0,0]\n[0,0,0,0]\n[0,0,3,3]\n[3,3,3,3]\n\nThe third output row has two 3s. If group B row 7 is [2,0,0,2], maybe rotating it right by one gives [2,2,0,0], but how does that relate to 3s? Not sure.\n\nAnother idea: Maybe the output is the result of applying a XOR between group A and group B elements. For example, XOR(0,2) is 2, but how does that become 3?\n\nAlternatively, adding group A and group B elements. For example, 0+2=2, 1+2=3. So if the rule is that the output is the sum of group A and group B elements. Let's check:\n\nIn Example 0's group B row 5: [0,2,0,2], group A row 0: [0,1,0,1]. Sum would be [0+0, 1+2, 0+0, 1+2] \u2192 [0,3,0,3]. But the output row is [0,0,0,0]. So that's not matching.\n\nBut in Example 1's first output row [3,0,3,3], group B row 5: [0,2,2,2], group A row 0: [1,1,0,0]. Sum would be [1,3,2,2], which doesn't match.\n\nAnother possibility: Convert group B's 2s to 3s, but only if group A's corresponding element is 0. Otherwise, convert to 0. Let's try Example 0's group B row 5:\n\nGroup B row 5: [0,2,0,2]\n\nGroup A row 0: [0,1,0,1]\n\nSo for each element:\n\nIf B is 2 and A is 0 \u21923.\n\nElse if B is 2 and A is 1 \u21920.\n\nElse \u21920.\n\nSo the output row would be [0 (B=0), 0 (B=2, A=1), 0 (B=0), 0 (B=2, A=1)] \u2192 [0,0,0,0], which matches Example 0's first output row.\n\nGroup B row 8: [2,2,2,0]\n\nGroup A row 3: [0,0,0,1]\n\nProcessing each element:\n\nPosition 0: B=2, A=0 \u21923.\n\nPosition 1: B=2, A=0 \u21923.\n\nPosition 2: B=2, A=0 \u21923.\n\nPosition 3: B=0 \u21920.\n\nSo output row would be [3,3,3,0], but Example 0's fourth output row is [3,3,3,3]. So discrepancy here.\n\nWait, but in Example 0's output row 4, which is [3,3,3,3], group B row 8 is [2,2,2,0], group A row 3 is [0,0,0,1]. Position 3 in group B is 0, so output should be 0. But the output has 3. So this suggests the rule isn't correct.\n\nPerhaps there's more to it. Maybe when group B's row is 2, the corresponding group A's row is checked, but perhaps across all rows, not just the same index.\n\nFor example, for each element in group B's rows, if any of the group A's rows in the same column has a 0, then 2 becomes 3. Otherwise, 0. Let's see.\n\nIn Example 0's group B row 5: [0,2,0,2], column 1 has 2. Checking group A's column 1 across all rows: group A rows are:\n\nRow 0: [0,1,0,1]\n\nRow 1: [0,0,0,1]\n\nRow 2: [1,0,1,0]\n\nRow 3: [0,0,0,1]\n\nSo column 1 in group A has 1,0,0,0. So there are 0s. So in group B's column 1, 2 becomes 3. But in Example 0's first output row, column 1 is 0. So this doesn't fit.\n\nI'm stuck. Let me try to find another pattern.\n\nLooking at the output rows, they seem to form patterns like 3s and 0s arranged in blocks. For example, in Example 0's output, the last two rows have clusters of 3s. Maybe the output is some kind of image transformation where 3s represent filled blocks.\n\nAlternatively, the output could be related to the binary representation of the numbers. For instance, 3 in binary is 11, which might combine 1 and 2.\n\nAlternatively, think of 0,1,2 as different signals, and the output combines them. For example, 1 and 2 might combine to 3 (1+2=3). But how does this apply across the rows?\n\nIn group A and group B, if there's a 1 in group A and a 2 in group B in the same position, sum to 3. Otherwise, 0. Let's test.\n\nExample 0's group B row 5: [0,2,0,2], group A row 0: [0,1,0,1]. Sum would be [0+0=0, 1+2=3, 0+0=0, 1+2=3]. But the output row is [0,0,0,0]. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, if group B has a 2, then output 3 if group A has a 0 in the same position. Otherwise, output 0. Let's test this.\n\nExample 0's group B row 8: [2,2,2,0], group A row 3: [0,0,0,1]. Positions 0-2 in group A are 0, so B's 2s become 3s. Position 3: B=0 \u21920. So output row would be [3,3,3,0], but the actual output is [3,3,3,3]. So discrepancy.\n\nMaybe group A isn't just the corresponding row but any row. For example, if any row in group A has a 0 in the same column as a 2 in group B, then output 3. Let's see.\n\nExample 0's group B row 8, column 3 is 0. Group A's column 3 has 1,1,0,1. So in group A's column 3, there's a 0 in row 2. So for group B row 8, column 3, since there's a 0 in group A's column 3, maybe output 3. But group B's column 3 is 0. So this doesn't make sense.\n\nAlternatively, for each position in group B, if there's a 2 in any group B row and a 0 in any group A row in that position, then output 3. But how to arrange this into four output rows.\n\nThis is getting too complicated. Let's try to think of another approach.\n\nLooking at the test input's group B rows:\n\nRow 5: [2,2,0,2]\n\nRow 6: [0,0,2,0]\n\nRow 7: [2,0,0,2]\n\nRow 8: [0,2,0,2]\n\nGroup A is:\n\nRow 0: [1,0,1,1]\n\nRow 1: [0,1,1,1]\n\nRow 2: [0,0,1,0]\n\nRow 3: [1,0,1,1]\n\nAssuming the rule is that for each element in group B rows, if it's 2 and the corresponding group A's row (same index) has 0, then output 3. Otherwise, 0.\n\nGroup B row 5 (index 5) pairs with group A row 0 (index 0):\n\nRow 5 elements: [2,2,0,2]\n\nGroup A row 0: [1,0,1,1]\n\nProcessing each element:\n\n2 (B) and 1 (A) \u21920.\n\n2 (B) and 0 (A) \u21923.\n\n0 (B) \u21920.\n\n2 (B) and 1 (A) \u21920.\n\nSo output row would be [0,3,0,0].\n\nGroup B row 6 (index 6) pairs with group A row 1 (index 1):\n\nRow 6: [0,0,2,0]\n\nGroup A row 1: [0,1,1,1]\n\nProcessing:\n\n0 \u21920.\n\n0 \u21920.\n\n2 (B) and 1 (A) \u21920.\n\n0 \u21920.\n\nOutput row: [0,0,0,0].\n\nGroup B row 7 (index7) pairs with group A row2 (index2):\n\nRow7: [2,0,0,2]\n\nGroup A row2: [0,0,1,0]\n\nProcessing:\n\n2 (B) and 0 (A) \u21923.\n\n0 \u21920.\n\n0 \u21920.\n\n2 (B) and 0 (A) \u21923.\n\nOutput row: [3,0,0,3].\n\nGroup B row8 (index8) pairs with group A row3 (index3):\n\nRow8: [0,2,0,2]\n\nGroup A row3: [1,0,1,1]\n\nProcessing:\n\n0 \u21920.\n\n2 (B) and 0 (A) \u21923.\n\n0 \u21920.\n\n2 (B) and 1 (A) \u21920.\n\nOutput row: [0,3,0,0].\n\nSo combining these, the output would be:\n\n[0,3,0,0]\n\n[0,0,0,0]\n\n[3,0,0,3]\n\n[0,3,0,0]\n\nBut looking at the training examples, this may not align with their structure. Let's check if this pattern aligns with any of the examples.\n\nIn Example 3's output:\n\n[3,3,0,0]\n\n[0,3,3,0]\n\n[0,3,3,3]\n\n[3,3,0,0]\n\nGroup B rows:\n\nRow5: [0,2,2,2] \u2192 paired with group A row0: [1,0,1,1]\n\nProcessing: 0\u21920, 2&A0 (0) \u21923, 2&A0 (1) \u21920, 2&A0 (1) \u21920 \u2192 output [0,3,0,0]. But Example3's first output row is [3,3,0,0]. So this doesn't fit.\n\nThus, this pattern isn't correct. \n\nAlternative approach: Maybe the output is generated by XORing the group A rows and group B rows, but with some transformation. For instance, 0 XOR 0 is 0, 1 XOR 2 is 3, etc. Let's test.\n\nIn Example0's group B row5: [0,2,0,2], group A row0: [0,1,0,1]. XOR each element:\n\n0^0=0, 1^2=3, 0^0=0, 1^2=3 \u2192 [0,3,0,3]. But output row is [0,0,0,0]. So no.\n\nAlternatively, sum group A and group B elements modulo 4. 0+2=2, 1+2=3. But output has 0 and 3.\n\nBut in Example0's output row 3: [0,0,3,3], group B row7: [2,0,0,2], group A row2: [1,0,1,0]. Sum: 3,0,1,2. Not matching.\n\nAnother idea: For each position, if group B has a 2 and group A has a 0 in the same position (any row), then output 3. Otherwise 0. But this would aggregate across all rows, but outputs are four rows. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, each output row is the result of combining two group B rows, where the 2s are replaced by 3s based on group A. Not sure.\n\nThis is taking too long. Maybe I should look for a pattern in the outputs. For example, each output row has exactly four elements, which could correspond to four columns. Maybe each output column is determined by the number of 2s in group B's column and the number of 0s in group A's column.\n\nFor instance, if a column in group B has exactly two 2s and group A's column has two 0s, then output 3s in certain positions.\n\nAlternatively, for each column, the number of 2s in group B equals the number of 0s in group A, then output 3s.\n\nBut in Example0's column 0:\n\nGroup B's column 0: [0,0,2,2] \u2192 two 2s.\n\nGroup A's column 0: [0,0,1,0] \u2192 three 0s.\n\nSo 2 vs 3. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, if in a column, group B has at least one 2 and group A has at least one 0, then output 3 in that column. But how to distribute across rows.\n\nAlternatively, each output row corresponds to a group B row, and for each element in that row, if the group B element is 2 and any group A row in that column has a 0, then output 3. Otherwise 0.\n\nLet's test this with Example0's group B row5: [0,2,0,2]. For each element:\n\nColumn 0: B=0 \u21920.\n\nColumn1: B=2. Group A's column1 has 1,0,0,0 \u2192 has 0s. So output 3.\n\nColumn2: B=0 \u21920.\n\nColumn3: B=2. Group A's column3 has 1,1,0,1 \u2192 has a 0. So output 3.\n\nThus, row would be [0,3,0,3]. But Example0's first output row is [0,0,0,0]. So this doesn't fit.\n\nI'm really stuck here. Maybe I should look for a different angle.\n\nWait, the output rows often have 3s where group B has 2s, but also considering group A. For example, in Example1's output row0: [3,0,3,3]. Group B row5 is [0,2,2,2], and group A row0 is [1,1,0,0]. For elements where B is 2 and A is 0 \u21923. So positions 2 and 3. But the output is [3,0,3,3]. So position 0 is 3 even though B is 0 and A is 1. This doesn't fit.\n\nAnother idea: Maybe the output is the product of group A and group B elements. For example, 0*2=0, 1*2=2, but output has 3s. Doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, group B elements are multiplied by 1.5, but 2*1.5=3. So perhaps group B elements are multiplied by 1.5 and converted to integers. But group B has 0s and 2s, so 0 becomes 0, 2 becomes 3. Then, if group A has a 0 in the same position, output 3; otherwise 0. For example:\n\nIn group B row5 of Example0: [0,2,0,2] \u2192 [0,3,0,3]. If group A's row0 has [0,1,0,1], then positions where group A is 0 would be 0,2. So output [3,0,3,0]. But the actual output is [0,0,0,0]. So this doesn't fit.\n\nI think I'm missing something obvious. Let's look for another pattern.\n\nLooking at Example0's output:\n\n[0,0,0,0]\n\n[0,0,0,0]\n\n[0,0,3,3]\n\n[3,3,3,3]\n\nNotice that the last two rows have increasing 3s. Maybe it's counting something, like the number of 2s in group B rows, but how.\n\nIn group B's rows:\n\nRow5: [0,2,0,2] \u2192 two 2s.\n\nRow6: [0,0,0,2] \u2192 one 2.\n\nRow7: [2,0,0,2] \u2192 two 2s.\n\nRow8: [2,2,2,0] \u2192 three 2s.\n\nBut the output rows don't seem to directly correlate to the count.\n\nAnother idea: Maybe the output rows are generated by applying a bitwise OR operation between group A and group B rows, but with 2s treated as 3s. For example:\n\nIn Example0's group B row8: [2,2,2,0] \u2192 treated as [3,3,3,0]. OR with group A row3: [0,0,0,1] \u2192 [3,3,3,1]. But output is [3,3,3,3]. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, group B's 2s are treated as 1s in binary, and group A's 0s and 1s are another bit. So combining them as bits.\n\nFor example, group A's element is 0 \u2192 0, 1 \u2192 1.\n\nGroup B's element is 0 \u2192 0, 2 \u2192 1.\n\nThen combining as binary: (group A bit) << 1 | group B bit. This would give 0, 1, 2, 3.\n\nBut output has 0 and 3. Let's see:\n\nExample0's group B row5: [0,2,0,2] \u2192 bits [0,1,0,1].\n\nGroup A row0: [0,1,0,1] \u2192 bits [0,1,0,1].\n\nCombining: 0<<1 |0=0, 1<<1 |1=3, 0<<1|0=0, 1<<1|1=3. So output would be [0,3,0,3]. But Example0's first output row is [0,0,0,0]. So this doesn't fit.\n\nBut Example0's output third row is [0,0,3,3]. Let's see:\n\nGroup B row7: [2,0,0,2] \u2192 bits [1,0,0,1].\n\nGroup A row2: [1,0,1,0] \u2192 bits [1,0,1,0].\n\nCombining: (1<<1) |1=3, (0<<1)|0=0, (1<<1)|0=2, (0<<1)|1=1. So output [3,0,2,1]. Not matching.\n\nThis approach isn't working.\n\nPerhaps the pattern involves the positions of 0s in group A and 2s in group B. For each position, if there's a 2 in group B and a 0 in group A in the same column and any row, then output 3 in that position. But this would create a single row, not four.\n\nAnother idea: Maybe each output row corresponds to a group B row, and the output is 3 in positions where group B has a 2 and the corresponding group A row (same index) has a 0. Else, 0.\n\nLet's test this with Example0:\n\nGroup B row5: [0,2,0,2], group A row0: [0,1,0,1].\n\nPositions where B is 2 and A is 0: columns 0 and 2 (B=2? No, B is 2 in columns 1 and 3. A in those columns is 1 and 1. So no 3s. So output [0,0,0,0], which matches.\n\nGroup B row6: [0,0,0,2], group A row1: [0,0,0,1].\n\nB=2 in column3, A=1 \u21920. Output [0,0,0,0].\n\nGroup B row7: [2,0,0,2], group A row2: [1,0,1,0].\n\nB=2 in column0 and 3. A row2's columns 0 and 3 are 1 and 0. So column0: B=2, A=1 \u21920. Column3: B=2, A=0 \u21923. So output [0,0,0,3]. But Example0's output row3 is [0,0,3,3]. So discrepancy.\n\nGroup B row8: [2,2,2,0], group A row3: [0,0,0,1].\n\nB=2 in columns0-2. A row3's columns0-2: 0,0,0. So all 3s. Output [3,3,3,0]. Example0's output row4 is [3,3,3,3]. So discrepancy in column3.\n\nHmm. Maybe there's a mistake in how group B rows are paired with group A rows. Maybe group B row5 pairs with group A row3, and group B row6 pairs with group A row0, etc. But this seems arbitrary.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the group B rows are processed in reverse order. For example, group B row8 is paired with group A row0, group B row7 with group A row1, etc.\n\nLet's test this with Example0's group B row8: [2,2,2,0], group A row0: [0,1,0,1].\n\nB=2 in columns0-2. A row0's columns0-2: 0,1,0.\n\nSo columns0: B=2, A=0 \u21923.\n\nColumn1: B=2, A=1 \u21920.\n\nColumn2: B=2, A=0 \u21923.\n\nColumn3: B=0 \u21920.\n\nOutput row: [3,0,3,0]. Example0's output row0 is [0,0,0,0]. Doesn't fit.\n\nThis is really challenging. I think I need to find another approach.\n\nLet me look at the test input and try to apply the previous hypothesis where each group B row is paired with the same-index group A row, and 2 becomes 3 if A's corresponding element is 0.\n\nTest input group B rows:\n\nRow5: [2,2,0,2] \u2192 paired with group A row0: [1,0,1,1]\n\nProcessing:\n\n- Column0: B=2, A=1 \u21920.\n\n- Column1: B=2, A=0 \u21923.\n\n- Column2: B=0 \u21920.\n\n- Column3: B=2, A=1 \u21920.\n\nOutput row: [0,3,0,0].\n\nRow6: [0,0,2,0] \u2192 paired with group A row1: [0,1,1,1]\n\nProcessing:\n\n- Column2: B=2, A=1 \u21920.\n\nOutput row: [0,0,0,0].\n\nRow7: [2,0,0,2] \u2192 paired with group A row2: [0,0,1,0]\n\nProcessing:\n\n- Column0: B=2, A=0 \u21923.\n\n- Column3: B=2, A=0 \u21923.\n\nOutput row: [3,0,0,3].\n\nRow8: [0,2,0,2] \u2192 paired with group A row3: [1,0,1,1]\n\nProcessing:\n\n- Column1: B=2, A=0 \u21923.\n\n- Column3: B=2, A=1 \u21920.\n\nOutput row: [0,3,0,0].\n\nSo the output would be:\n\n[0,3,0,0]\n\n[0,0,0,0]\n\n[3,0,0,3]\n\n[0,3,0,0]\n\nBut looking at the training examples, this format matches some of them. For instance, Example3's output has rows like [3,3,0,0], [0,3,3,0], etc. So this pattern might be correct.\n\nHowever, in Example0's third output row, according to this pattern, the output would be [0,0,0,3], but the actual output is [0,0,3,3]. So there's a discrepancy. But perhaps there's a mistake in my earlier analysis.\n\nWait, in Example0's group B row7: [2,0,0,2], paired with group A row2: [1,0,1,0]. According to the rule:\n\n- Column0: B=2, A=1 \u21920.\n\n- Column3: B=2, A=0 \u21923.\n\nSo output row would be [0,0,0,3]. But the actual output row is [0,0,3,3]. Where does the second 3 come from?\n\nAh, perhaps I made a mistake in the pairing. Let me recheck Example0's group B rows:\n\nGroup B rows after 4s are:\n\nRow5: [0,2,0,2]\n\nRow6: [0,0,0,2]\n\nRow7: [2,0,0,2]\n\nRow8: [2,2,2,0]\n\nSo group B has four rows (5-8), each paired with group A rows 0-3 respectively.\n\nIn Example0's group B row7 (third group B row) is paired with group A row2. Let's recheck:\n\nGroup B row7: [2,0,0,2]\n\nGroup A row2: [1,0,1,0]\n\nProcessing:\n\nColumn0: B=2, A=1 \u21920.\n\nColumn1: B=0 \u21920.\n\nColumn2: B=0 \u21920.\n\nColumn3: B=2, A=0 \u21923.\n\nSo output row should be [0,0,0,3]. But Example0's third output row is [0,0,3,3]. So there's a discrepancy in column2.\n\nHmm. This suggests that the pairing is not correct. Maybe there's a different way of pairing group B rows with group A rows.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps group B row5 is paired with group A row1, row6 with row2, row7 with row3, row8 with row0. Let's test this.\n\nExample0's group B row7 is [2,0,0,2], paired with group A row3: [0,0,0,1].\n\nProcessing:\n\nColumn0: B=2, A=0 \u21923.\n\nColumn3: B=2, A=1 \u21920.\n\nSo output row would be [3,0,0,0]. Still not matching Example0's output.\n\nAlternatively, group B row5 is paired with group A row3, row6 with row0, row7 with row1, row8 with row2. This seems arbitrary.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the group B rows are paired with group A rows in reverse order. For example, group B row5 pairs with group A row3, row6 with row2, row7 with row1, row8 with row0.\n\nExample0's group B row7 (index7) pairs with group A row1 (index1):\n\nGroup B row7: [2,0,0,2]\n\nGroup A row1: [0,0,0,1]\n\nProcessing:\n\nColumn0: B=2, A=0 \u21923.\n\nColumn3: B=2, A=1 \u21920.\n\nOutput row: [3,0,0,0].\n\nStill not matching.\n\nAt this point, I'm not able to find a consistent pattern. Given the time I've spent and the need to provide an answer, I'll proceed with the hypothesis that each group B row is paired with the same-index group A row (mod 4), and output 3 where B is 2 and A is 0. \n\nApplying this to the test input:\n\nTest input group B rows 5-8:\n\nRow5: [2,2,0,2] \u2192 group A row0: [1,0,1,1]\n\nOutput: [0,3,0,0].\n\nRow6: [0,0,2,0] \u2192 group A row1: [0,1,1,1]\n\nOutput: [0,0,0,0].\n\nRow7: [2,0,0,2] \u2192 group A row2: [0,0,1,0]\n\nOutput: [3,0,0,3].\n\nRow8: [0,2,0,2] \u2192 group A row3: [1,0,1,1]\n\nOutput: [0,3,0,0].\n\nThus, the output would be:\n\n[0,3,0,0]\n\n[0,0,0,0]\n\n[3,0,0,3]\n\n[0,3,0,0]\n\nBut looking at the training examples, the outputs have varying patterns. For instance, Example1's output has rows like [3,0,3,3], which could be generated using this method.\n\nGiven the time constraints, I'll proceed with this pattern and format the test output accordingly.",

        "cot_2": "Okay, let's tackle this puzzle. The goal is to figure out the pattern that transforms the input lists into the output lists. Let's start by looking at the training examples to see if I can spot any patterns.\n\nFirst, looking at Example 0. The input has 9 lists, and the output has 4. So maybe the input is split into two parts: the first part is the first four lists, then the fifth list is [4,4,4,4], which might act as a separator. Then the next four lists are from sixth to ninth, and the output is four lists. Wait, but the output has four lists each time, but the input has nine. Hmm. Wait, let's check the input structure for each example.\n\nAll examples have an input with 9 lists. The outputs have 4 lists each. So perhaps the 9 input lists are divided into two groups. Let's see: maybe the first four are group A, then the fifth is a separator (all 4s), then the next four are group B. Then the output is derived from combining group A and B somehow?\n\nLooking at Example 0's input:\n\nGroup A:\n[0,1,0,1]\n[0,0,0,1]\n[1,0,1,0]\n[0,0,0,1]\n\nThen [4,4,4,4], then group B:\n[0,2,0,2]\n[0,0,0,2]\n[2,0,0,2]\n[2,2,2,0]\n\nOutput is four lists. Let's see if there's a relation between group A and group B leading to the output.\n\nLooking at the output of Example 0:\n\n[0,0,0,0]\n[0,0,0,0]\n[0,0,3,3]\n[3,3,3,3]\n\nNotice the 3s here. The numbers in the output are 0 and 3. Maybe 3 comes from combining 0 and 2? Because group B has 0s and 2s. Or maybe group A has 0s and 1s, group B has 0s,2s. Hmm.\n\nWait, group A elements in Example 0 have 0 and 1, and group B has 0, 2. The output uses 0 and 3. So 0+0=0, 0+2=2? No. Wait, maybe 1 from group A and 2 from group B add up to 3? Because 1+2=3. Let's check that.\n\nIn Example 0's output, the third list is [0,0,3,3]. Let's look at the corresponding positions in group A and B.\n\nGroup A's third list is [1,0,1,0], group B's third list (since group B is lists 6-9, which are fifth list onwards after the separator) is [2,0,0,2]. Wait, the third list in group B would be the sixth list? Wait, the input lists are:\n\n0: [0,1,0,1]\n1: [0,0,0,1]\n2: [1,0,1,0]\n3: [0,0,0,1]\n4: [4,4,4,4]\n5: [0,2,0,2]\n6: [0,0,0,2]\n7: [2,0,0,2]\n8: [2,2,2,0]\n\nSo group A is 0-3 (first four), group B is 5-8 (next four after the separator). The output has four lists. Let's see if each output list is a combination of group A and B lists. For example, output list 0 could be group A list 0 and group B list 5? But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe each position in the output is determined by the sum of group A and group B elements. For example, for each position (i,j), output[i][j] = A[i][j] + B[i][j]. But in example 0, group A's first list is [0,1,0,1], group B's first list (after separator) is [0,2,0,2]. Adding them would give [0+0,1+2,0+0,1+2] = [0,3,0,3], but the output's first list is [0,0,0,0]. So that doesn't match. So that's not the pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is a grid where each cell is 3 if either group A or group B has a non-zero in that position. But in example 0, group A's first list is [0,1,0,1], group B's first list is [0,2,0,2]. Combining, positions 1 and 3 have 1 and 2. But the output is all zeros here. So maybe not that.\n\nWait, looking at example 0's output, the first two output lists are all zeros, then the third has two 3s, and the fourth is all 3s. Let's check the group B lists. Group B's third list is [2,0,0,2], group B's fourth list is [2,2,2,0]. Wait, maybe the output is generated from group B? But how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is a transformation of group B where 0s and 2s become 0s and 3s. For example, 2 becomes 3. Let's see. In example 0's group B lists:\n\nList5: [0,2,0,2] \u2192 if 2\u21923, becomes [0,3,0,3]. But the first output list is [0,0,0,0], so that doesn't match. So maybe not a direct substitution.\n\nAnother approach: look for the positions where 3s appear in the outputs and see what's in the input for those positions. Let's take example 0's output. The third list is [0,0,3,3]. So in the third list of the output, the third and fourth elements are 3. Looking at the group B lists for the third list (which is list7 in the input: [2,0,0,2]). So in positions 0, 3 are 2, and 1,2 are 0. The output for that position (third list) is [0,0,3,3]. Hmm, maybe the sum of group A and group B elements. Let's check group A's third list (input list2): [1,0,1,0]. So adding group A's third list (1,0,1,0) and group B's third list (2,0,0,2) gives 3,0,1,2. But the output has 0,0,3,3. That doesn't add up. Alternatively, perhaps 3 is present where either group A or group B has a non-zero. For example, in group A's third list, elements 0 and 2 are 1, and group B's third list elements 0 and 3 are 2. So combining, positions 0 (1+2=3?), 2 (1+0=1?), but output third list's elements 2 and 3 are 3. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the sum of the corresponding elements from group A and group B, but with some modulo. For example, if group A has 0/1 and group B has 0/2, summing them gives 0,1,2,3. Then perhaps 3 is allowed, but others are set to 0? Wait, in example 0's first output list, [0,0,0,0], the sum would be group A's first list [0,1,0,1] plus group B's first list [0,2,0,2] \u2192 [0,3,0,3]. But output is all zeros. So perhaps 3 is only kept when a certain condition is met.\n\nAlternatively, maybe if both group A and group B have non-zero in the same position, then 3 is there. Otherwise 0. For example, in group A's first list: [0,1,0,1] and group B's first list [0,2,0,2]. So positions where both have non-zero: none. Because group A has 1s where group B has 2s. So output is all zeros, which matches example 0's first output. Then, for the third output list in example 0: group A's third list is [1,0,1,0], group B's third list is [2,0,0,2]. So positions 0: 1 and 2 (A) vs 2 (B) \u2192 1 and 2, but since they are different, maybe not. Hmm, this isn't matching. Because the output's third list has 3s in positions 2 and 3. Wait, perhaps only when group B has a 2 in that position, regardless of group A. Then, group B's first list has 2s in positions 1 and 3, but the output is 0. So that doesn't fit.\n\nWait, let's look at another example. Example 1's input:\n\nGroup A:\n[1,1,0,0]\n[1,0,1,0]\n[1,1,0,1]\n[0,1,1,0]\n\nGroup B after separator:\n[0,2,2,2]\n[2,0,2,0]\n[2,2,2,2]\n[2,2,2,2]\n\nOutput is:\n[3,0,3,3]\n[0,0,0,0]\n[0,0,3,0]\n[3,0,0,3]\n\nLooking at the first output list [3,0,3,3]. If group A's first list is [1,1,0,0], group B's first list is [0,2,2,2]. So sum is 1+0=1, 1+2=3, 0+2=2, 0+2=2. But the output has 3s in positions 0, 2, 3. Hmm, that doesn't match. Alternatively, maybe 3 appears where group A has 1 and group B has 2. Let's check. Position 0: group A is 1, group B is 0 \u2192 sum is 1, not 3. But output here is 3. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternative idea: maybe the output is generated by overlaying group A and B, with group B elements replacing group A's elements in some way. For example, if group B's element is 2, replace with 3, else keep group A's element. But group A's first element in example 0 is 0, group B's is 0 \u2192 output 0. But group B's first element is 0,2,0,2. If we replace 2 with 3, we get [0,3,0,3], but output is [0,0,0,0]. So that's not matching.\n\nWait, maybe the output is created by checking for the presence of 1s in group A and 2s in group B. Let's think: for each position (i,j) in the output, if group A's corresponding position (i,j) is 1 and group B's (i,j) is 2, then output 3. Otherwise, 0. Let's check example 0's first list:\n\nGroup A's first list is [0,1,0,1], group B's first list is [0,2,0,2]. So positions where A is 1 and B is 2: positions 1 and 3. Then output should have 3s there. But example 0's first output list is [0,0,0,0]. So that doesn't work.\n\nAlternatively, if either A is 1 or B is 2, then output 3, else 0. Then, in example 0's first list, group A has 1s at positions 1 and 3, group B has 2s at 1 and 3. So output would be 3s at positions 1 and 3. But example 0's output's first list is all zeros. So that doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. Maybe the answer is related to the sum of group A and group B, but modulo 4. Let's see. For example 0, group A's first list is [0,1,0,1], group B's first list is [0,2,0,2]. Sum is [0,3,0,3]. Modulo 4 gives [0,3,0,3]. But output is [0,0,0,0]. So that's not matching.\n\nWait, maybe the output is a bitwise OR operation. For group A elements (0 or 1) and group B elements (0,2). So 0 OR 0 = 0, 1 OR 0 =1, 0 OR 2=2, 1 OR2=3. Then, for example 0's first list: group A [0,1,0,1], group B [0,2,0,2]. OR would be [0|0, 1|2, 0|0, 1|2] \u2192 [0,3,0,3]. But the output is [0,0,0,0]. So that's not matching. However, perhaps if the output is 3 where either group A is 1 or group B is 2, but then why isn't it 3s in those positions?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the product of group A and group B elements. For example, 1*2=2, but the output uses 3. Not directly. Hmm.\n\nAnother approach: looking at the output dimensions. Each output is four lists of four elements. The input's group A and group B each have four lists. So maybe each output list is generated by combining group A and group B in some way for each row. Let's look at example 0's output again. The third list of the output is [0,0,3,3]. Let's check group A's third list [1,0,1,0] and group B's third list [2,0,0,2]. Maybe if group A's element is 1 and group B's element is 2, then output 3. If both are 0, output 0. If one is non-zero but not both, output 0. So positions where A is 1 and B is 2. In group A's third list, positions 0 and 2 are 1. In group B's third list, positions 0 and 3 are 2. So overlapping positions where both are non-zero would be position 0 (A:1, B:2). But the output third list has 3s in positions 2 and 3. So that doesn't align.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's the sum of group A's element multiplied by 1 and group B's multiplied by 2. So for example, 1*1 + 2*2=5, but that's not in the output. But if we take modulo 4, 5 mod4 is 1. Hmm, not helpful.\n\nLet me think of another angle. The separator list is [4,4,4,4], which might not be part of the groups. So group A is first four lists, group B is next four lists (after the separator). The output has four lists. So perhaps each output list corresponds to combining group A and group B lists in some way. For example, output list 0 is some function of group A list 0 and group B list 0.\n\nLooking at example 0:\n\nGroup A list 0: [0,1,0,1]\n\nGroup B list 0: [0,2,0,2]\n\nOutput list0: [0,0,0,0]\n\nHmm. How can these two combine to [0,0,0,0]?\n\nWait, maybe the output is determined by whether group A and group B's elements are non-zero in the same position. For example, if both are non-zero, output 3; else 0. So in group A list0 and group B list0, group A has 1s in positions 1 and 3, group B has 2s in positions 1 and 3. So overlapping non-zero elements. So output would be [0,3,0,3]. But the output is [0,0,0,0]. So that's not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is 3 where group B's element is 2, but only if group A's element is 1. Let's check example0's group B list0: [0,2,0,2]. Group A list0: [0,1,0,1]. So positions where B is 2 and A is 1: positions 1 and 3. So output would be [0,3,0,3]. But output list0 is [0,0,0,0]. Doesn't fit.\n\nHmm, maybe the pattern isn't directly combining group A and group B. Let's look at the outputs. All outputs are made of 0s and 3s. So maybe the 3s come from some condition. Let's think of the input as two matrices (group A and B) and the output is a matrix where each cell is 3 if certain conditions are met.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the result of some kind of binary operation, treating group A's elements as bits (0 or 1) and group B's as another set. For example, if group B's element is 2, perhaps it's treated as a binary flag. But I'm not sure.\n\nWait, looking at example 1's output:\n\n[3,0,3,3]\n[0,0,0,0]\n[0,0,3,0]\n[3,0,0,3]\n\nGroup A's first list: [1,1,0,0]\n\nGroup B's first list: [0,2,2,2]\n\nSo group A has 1s in positions 0 and 1, group B has 2s in positions 1,2,3. Output list0 is [3,0,3,3]. So position 0: 3 (A=1, B=0), position1:0 (A=1, B=2), position2:3 (A=0, B=2), position3:3 (A=0, B=2). Hmm, this is confusing. How does that produce 3s where either A is 1 or B is 2? Position0: A=1, B=0 \u2192 3. Position2: A=0, B=2 \u21923. So maybe if either A is 1 or B is 2, then output 3. But in that case, position1 in example1's output list0 would be 3 (since A=1 and B=2), but it's 0. So that contradicts.\n\nWait, example1's output list0 is [3,0,3,3]. For position1: A=1, B=2. So according to that idea, it should be 3, but it's 0. So that can't be right.\n\nAlternative approach: let's look for the presence of 3s in the outputs and see what's common in the inputs.\n\nTake example0's output. The third list has 3s in positions 2 and 3. Let's check group B's third list (list7) is [2,0,0,2]. So positions 0 and 3 are 2. But the output's third list has 3s in positions 2 and 3. That doesn't align. Group A's third list is [1,0,1,0], positions 0 and 2 are 1. So combining group A and B's third lists, the output's third list has 3s where group A has 1 and group B has 0? Or group B has 2. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the sum of the elements in group A and group B, but replacing 2 with 3. For example, group A's element is 0 or 1, group B's is 0 or 2. So sum would be 0,1,2,3. Then replace 2 with 0 and 3 with 3. So for example, in example0's group A list0 and group B list0: sum is 0,3,0,3. Replace 3 with 3, others with 0. So output would be [0,3,0,3], but example0's output list0 is all zeros. Doesn't fit.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps the output is group B where each 2 is replaced by 3, and group A's 1s are subtracted. Like, if group B has 2 and group A has 0, then 3. If group B has 2 and group A has 1, then 2. But that doesn't make sense.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is 3 wherever group B has 2, but group A has 1. For example, if group B's element is 2 and group A's element is 1, then output 3. Otherwise, 0. In example0's group B list0: positions 1 and 3 are 2. Group A list0's positions 1 and 3 are 1. So output would be [0,3,0,3]. But the output list0 is all zeros. So that's not matching.\n\nWait, maybe the output is 3 wherever group B has 2, but only if group A's corresponding element is 0. So for example0's group B list0: positions 1 and 3 are 2. Group A's list0 positions 1 and 3 are 1, so those positions in output would be 0. But group B list0's positions 0 and 2 are 0. So output would be 0. Which matches example0's output list0.\n\nLet's test this hypothesis. For example1's group B list0: [0,2,2,2]. group A list0: [1,1,0,0]. So group B's elements are 2 in positions 1,2,3. group A's elements are 1,1,0,0. So in positions where group B is 2 and group A is 0: positions 2 and 3. So output would be [0,0,3,3]. But example1's output list0 is [3,0,3,3]. So position0 is 3, which according to this hypothesis shouldn't happen. So that doesn't fit.\n\nBut in example1's output list0, position0 is 3. group B's position0 is 0. So according to this hypothesis, that's not possible. So the hypothesis is wrong.\n\nAlternative idea: maybe the output is 3 wherever group B has 2, regardless of group A. But example0's group B list0 has 2s in positions1 and 3. If output is 3s there, output list0 would be [0,3,0,3], but example0's output list0 is all zeros. So that's not correct.\n\nHmm. Let's think differently. The output lists have 4 elements each. Maybe the output is a transformation of the group B lists where each 2 is replaced by 3. But example0's group B lists:\n\nlist5: [0,2,0,2] \u2192 [0,3,0,3]\n\nlist6: [0,0,0,2] \u2192 [0,0,0,3]\n\nlist7: [2,0,0,2] \u2192 [3,0,0,3]\n\nlist8: [2,2,2,0] \u2192 [3,3,3,0]\n\nBut example0's output is:\n\n[0,0,0,0]\n\n[0,0,0,0]\n\n[0,0,3,3]\n\n[3,3,3,3]\n\nSo the first two output lists are all zeros, but the transformed group B lists would start with [0,3,0,3], which isn't the case. So this doesn't fit.\n\nWait, maybe the output is a matrix multiplication of group A and group B? But the dimensions are 4x4 each, so the product would be a 4x4 matrix. But example0's group A is four 4-element lists, group B is four 4-element lists. Not sure how that would multiply.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's a bitwise XOR between group A and group B. For example, group A's elements are 0 or 1, group B's are 0 or 2. XOR between 0 and 0 is 0, 0 and 2 is 2, 1 and 0 is 1, 1 and 2 is 3. So output would be:\n\nFor example0's first list:\n\nA: 0,1,0,1\n\nB:0,2,0,2\n\nXOR: 0^0=0, 1^2=3, 0^0=0, 1^2=3 \u2192 [0,3,0,3]. But example0's first output list is all zeros. So that doesn't fit.\n\nBut example0's output third list is [0,0,3,3]. So perhaps this idea is partially correct. Let's check group A's third list [1,0,1,0] and group B's third list [2,0,0,2].\n\nXOR: 1^2=3, 0^0=0, 1^0=1, 0^2=2. Which gives [3,0,1,2], but the output is [0,0,3,3]. So that's not matching.\n\nHmm. This is tricky. Let me look at another example. Example3's output:\n\n[3,3,0,0]\n\n[0,3,3,0]\n\n[0,3,3,3]\n\n[3,3,0,0]\n\nGroup A:\n\n[1,0,1,1]\n\n[0,0,0,1]\n\n[1,1,0,0]\n\n[0,0,1,1]\n\nGroup B:\n\n[0,2,2,2]\n\n[0,2,2,2]\n\n[2,0,2,2]\n\n[2,2,2,2]\n\nSo output list0 is [3,3,0,0]. Let's see:\n\nGroup A list0: [1,0,1,1]\n\nGroup B list0: [0,2,2,2]\n\nIf we XOR these elements: 1^0=1, 0^2=2, 1^2=3, 1^2=3. So [1,2,3,3]. But output is [3,3,0,0]. Doesn't match.\n\nAnother thought: maybe the output is generated by considering pairs of lists from group A and group B. For example, output list0 is group B list0 with 2s replaced by 3, but only if the corresponding group A list0's element is 1. So if group A's element is 1, then group B's 2 becomes 3; otherwise, it's 0.\n\nLet's test this with example0's group A list0 [0,1,0,1] and group B list0 [0,2,0,2]. So for each position:\n\n- group A is 0: output 0 (since group B is 2, but group A is 0 \u2192 0).\n\n- group A is 1: group B's 2 \u21923.\n\nSo output would be [0,3,0,3]. But example0's output list0 is [0,0,0,0]. So that's not matching.\n\nBut in example3's output list0 is [3,3,0,0]. group A list0 is [1,0,1,1], group B list0 is [0,2,2,2]. According to this rule, positions where group A is 1 are 0,2,3. group B's corresponding elements are 0,2,2. So replacing group B's 2s with 3s only where group A is 1: positions 0 (A=1, B=0 \u2192 0?), 2 (A=1, B=2 \u21923), 3 (A=1, B=2\u21923). So output would be [0,0,3,3]. But example3's output list0 is [3,3,0,0]. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternative approach: perhaps the output is the product of group A and group B. For example, group A element * group B element. But group B's elements are 0, 2, etc. For example0's group A list0 and group B list0: [0*0, 1*2, 0*0, 1*2] \u2192 [0,2,0,2]. But output is [0,0,0,0]. So maybe 2 is replaced with 3. Then [0,3,0,3]. But example0's output is all zeros. Doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. Maybe there's a different pattern. Let's think about the number of 3s in each output list. For example0's output, the third list has two 3s, fourth has four. Let's see group B's third list is [2,0,0,2], group B's fourth list is [2,2,2,0]. The output third list is [0,0,3,3], which has two 3s where group B's third list has 2s in positions 0 and 3, but the output has 3s in positions 2 and 3. So that doesn't align.\n\nWait, maybe the output is a shifted version of group B. For example, group B lists are shifted right or left by some amount. For example0's group B lists:\n\nlist5: [0,2,0,2] \u2192 output list0 is [0,0,0,0]. Maybe shifted by two to the right? [2,0,2,0] \u2192 but output is zeros. Not matching.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps the output is generated by checking if the sum of group A and group B lists for each row is even or odd, then converting to 3s where certain conditions are met. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is related to the number of times a certain value appears in the input lists. But given the examples, it's unclear.\n\nLet's try to think of other patterns. The outputs are four lists each of four elements. Maybe the output is a transformation of group B where each row is modified based on some rules. For example, in example0's group B lists:\n\nlist5: [0,2,0,2]\n\nlist6: [0,0,0,2]\n\nlist7: [2,0,0,2]\n\nlist8: [2,2,2,0]\n\nThe output lists are:\n\n[0,0,0,0]\n\n[0,0,0,0]\n\n[0,0,3,3]\n\n[3,3,3,3]\n\nSo, the third output list is [0,0,3,3], which corresponds to group B's list7: [2,0,0,2]. The output's third list has 3s in the last two positions. Group B's list7 has 2s in first and last positions. Hmm. Maybe the output's third list is group B's third list with 2s replaced by 3s and shifted in some way. For example, reversed: [2,0,0,2] reversed is [2,0,0,2], which would be [3,0,0,3] if replaced. But output third list is [0,0,3,3]. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the output lists are the result of some kind of cumulative process. For example, the third output list in example0 has 3s in positions 2 and 3. Maybe if you look at the cumulative sum of group B's elements up to that row.\n\nThis is getting frustrating. Let's try to find another approach. The key might be that group A and group B are processed in a specific way, perhaps combining them into a single grid. Another possibility is that the output represents the number of times a 2 appears in group B's columns, but adjusted somehow.\n\nWait, let's look at the output dimensions. Each output list is four elements. Suppose the output is four lists representing the four columns of some combined grid. For example, each output list represents a column, and each element in the list is 3 if certain conditions are met in the column across the group B lists.\n\nFor example, example0's group B lists are:\n\nRow5: [0,2,0,2]\n\nRow6: [0,0,0,2]\n\nRow7: [2,0,0,2]\n\nRow8: [2,2,2,0]\n\nIf we consider the columns of group B:\n\nColumn0: 0,0,2,2 \u2192 values 0,0,2,2 \u2192 sum is 4.\n\nColumn1:2,0,0,2 \u2192 sum 4.\n\nColumn2:0,0,0,2 \u2192 sum 2.\n\nColumn3:2,2,2,0 \u2192 sum 6.\n\nBut how would this relate to the output? The output has four lists, but each list has four elements. So perhaps not.\n\nAlternative idea: maybe each element in the output is 3 if the corresponding column in group B has at least one 2. For example, column0 in group B for example0 has 0,0,2,2 \u2192 has 2s. So output column0 would have 3s. But example0's output has first two lists as zeros. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is 3 for each cell where the corresponding group B cell is 2 and it's the first occurrence in its column. For example, in group B of example0:\n\nColumn0 has first 2 in row7. So output row7, column0 would be 3. But example0's output third list (row7) has [0,0,3,3]. Not matching.\n\nThis is really challenging. Let's try to look for a different angle. Maybe the output is based on the positions where group A and group B have the same element. But group A has 0/1 and group B has 0/2. So same element only when both are 0. In that case, output would be 3 where both are 0. But example0's group A list0 is [0,1,0,1], group B list0 is [0,2,0,2]. Positions where both are 0: positions 0 and 2. So output would have 3s there. But example0's output list0 is all zeros. So no.\n\nAnother approach: think of the output as a 4x4 grid, and perhaps each cell corresponds to the sum of group A's cell and group B's cell multiplied by some factor, but I'm not seeing it.\n\nWait, the output in example0's third list is [0,0,3,3]. Let's check group B's third list (row7) is [2,0,0,2]. If we replace 2 with 3, it becomes [3,0,0,3]. Then, maybe the output is shifting this list to the right by two positions, wrapping around. So [3,0,0,3] shifted right by two would be [0,3,3,0]. But the output is [0,0,3,3]. Not matching.\n\nAlternatively, shifting right by one: [3,3,0,0]. Not matching.\n\nHmm. Maybe the output is the result of some logical operation between group A and group B, then transformed into 0s and 3s. For example, if group A's cell is 1 or group B's cell is 2, then 3, else 0. Let's test this.\n\nExample0's group A list0: [0,1,0,1], group B list0: [0,2,0,2]. So for each cell:\n\n0 or 0 \u21920 \u21920.\n\n1 or 2 \u2192 true \u21923.\n\n0 or 0 \u21920 \u21920.\n\n1 or 2 \u21923.\n\nSo output would be [0,3,0,3]. But example0's output list0 is all zeros. Doesn't fit.\n\nBut in example1's output list0: [3,0,3,3].\n\nGroup A list0: [1,1,0,0], group B list0: [0,2,2,2].\n\n1 or 0 \u21921 \u21923.\n\n1 or 2 \u2192true \u21923.\n\n0 or 2 \u2192true \u21923.\n\n0 or 2 \u2192true \u21923.\n\nSo output should be [3,3,3,3], but example1's output list0 is [3,0,3,3]. So position1 is 0. That contradicts.\n\nBut wait, example1's output list0 has 3,0,3,3. So for position1, group A is 1 and group B is 2. According to the rule, it should be 3. But the output is 0. So this rule is incorrect.\n\nAlternative idea: maybe the output is 3 where group B's cell is 2 and group A's cell is 0. Let's check example0's group B list0:\n\nPositions with 2: 1,3. Group A list0's positions: 1 and 3 are 1. So no matches. Output list0 is zeros. Which fits.\n\nFor example1's group B list0: positions 1,2,3 are 2. Group A list0's positions: 1 is 1, 2 and 3 are 0. So in positions 2 and 3, group B is 2 and group A is 0 \u2192 output 3. So output list0 would be [0,0,3,3], but example1's output list0 is [3,0,3,3]. Position0 is 3. group B's position0 is 0. So why is that 3?\n\nHmm, this doesn't fit. But example1's output list0's position0 is 3. group A's position0 is 1, group B's is 0. According to this rule, it should be 0, not 3.\n\nThis suggests the rule is not correct.\n\nLet's try another example. Take example3's output list0: [3,3,0,0].\n\nGroup A list0: [1,0,1,1].\n\nGroup B list0: [0,2,2,2].\n\nAccording to the rule where output is 3 where group B is 2 and group A is 0, positions 1,2,3 in group B are 2, and group A's corresponding cells are 0,1,1. So only position1 in group A is 0. So output should be [0,3,0,0]. But example3's output list0 is [3,3,0,0]. So position0 is 3. This doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. Maybe there's another condition. What if the output is 3 where either group B is 2, or group A is 1, but not both? So XOR of the two. For example:\n\nIf group A is 1 and group B is 0 \u2192 3.\n\nIf group A is 0 and group B is 2 \u21923.\n\nOtherwise 0.\n\nLet's test this for example0's group A list0 and group B list0:\n\ngroup A list0: [0,1,0,1]\n\ngroup B list0: [0,2,0,2]\n\nFor each position:\n\n0 and 0 \u2192 no \u21920.\n\n1 and 2 \u2192 both non-zero \u21920.\n\n0 and 0 \u21920.\n\n1 and 2 \u2192 both non-zero \u21920.\n\nSo output list0 would be [0,0,0,0]. Which matches example0's output.\n\nNow example1's group A list0: [1,1,0,0], group B list0: [0,2,2,2].\n\nPosition0: 1 and 0 \u21923.\n\nPosition1:1 and 2 \u21920.\n\nPosition2:0 and 2 \u21923.\n\nPosition3:0 and 2 \u21923.\n\nSo output list0 would be [3,0,3,3]. Which matches example1's output.\n\nExample3's output list0: [3,3,0,0].\n\nGroup A list0: [1,0,1,1]\n\nGroup B list0: [0,2,2,2]\n\nPosition0:1 and 0 \u21923.\n\nPosition1:0 and 2 \u21923.\n\nPosition2:1 and 2 \u21920.\n\nPosition3:1 and 2 \u21920.\n\nSo output list0 would be [3,3,0,0], which matches example3's output.\n\nThis seems promising. Let's test another example.\n\nExample2's output list0: [0,3,0,0].\n\nGroup A list0: [0,1,0,0]\n\nGroup B list0: [0,0,0,0].\n\nWait, example2's group B lists after the separator (lists5-8):\n\nList5: [0,0,0,0]\n\nList6: [0,2,0,2]\n\nList7: [2,2,0,2]\n\nList8: [0,2,0,0]\n\nSo group B list0 (list5) is [0,0,0,0].\n\nGroup A list0 is [0,1,0,0].\n\nApplying the rule: output is 3 where (A=1 and B=0) or (A=0 and B=2).\n\nBut group B list0 is all zeros, so only the first part applies: where A=1 and B=0. In group A list0, position1 is 1. B is 0. So output position1 is 3. Other positions are 0. So output list0 should be [0,3,0,0]. Which matches example2's output list0.\n\nYes, this rule seems to work. Let's check another case.\n\nExample2's output list3 is [3,0,3,0].\n\nGroup A list3: [1,1,1,0]\n\nGroup B list3 (list8): [0,2,0,0].\n\nApplying the rule:\n\nFor each position:\n\n0: A=1, B=0 \u21923.\n\n1: A=1, B=2 \u21920.\n\n2: A=1, B=0 \u21923.\n\n3: A=0, B=0 \u21920.\n\nSo output list3 would be [3,0,3,0], which matches.\n\nThis seems to fit all examples. So the pattern is:\n\nFor each position (i,j) in the output:\n\nIf (group A's list i, position j is 1 AND group B's list i, position j is 0) OR (group A's list i, position j is 0 AND group B's list i, position j is 2), then output 3. Otherwise, output 0.\n\nSo the output is 3 in positions where either:\n\n- Group A has a 1 and group B has a 0, or\n\n- Group A has a 0 and group B has a 2.\n\nOtherwise, it's 0.\n\nNow, let's apply this rule to the test input.\n\nTest input:\n\nGroup A:\n\n[1,0,1,1]\n\n[0,1,1,1]\n\n[0,0,1,0]\n\n[1,0,1,1]\n\nSeparator: [4,4,4,4]\n\nGroup B lists:\n\n[2,2,0,2]\n\n[0,0,2,0]\n\n[2,0,0,2]\n\n[0,2,0,2]\n\nSo group B lists are:\n\nList5: [2,2,0,2]\n\nList6: [0,0,2,0]\n\nList7: [2,0,0,2]\n\nList8: [0,2,0,2]\n\nNow, for each output list (0-3), we need to process group A's list0-3 and group B's list5-8.\n\nOutput list0 corresponds to group A list0 and group B list5.\n\nGroup A list0: [1,0,1,1]\n\nGroup B list5: [2,2,0,2]\n\nFor each position j (0-3):\n\nj0: A=1, B=2 \u2192 no \u21920.\n\nj1: A=0, B=2 \u2192 yes \u21923.\n\nj2: A=1, B=0 \u2192 yes \u21923.\n\nj3: A=1, B=2 \u2192 no \u21920.\n\nSo output list0: [0,3,3,0].\n\nOutput list1 corresponds to group A list1 and group B list6.\n\nGroup A list1: [0,1,1,1]\n\nGroup B list6: [0,0,2,0]\n\nj0: A=0, B=0 \u21920.\n\nj1: A=1, B=0 \u2192 yes \u21923.\n\nj2: A=1, B=2 \u2192 no \u21920.\n\nj3: A=1, B=0 \u2192 yes \u21923.\n\nSo output list1: [0,3,0,3].\n\nOutput list2 corresponds to group A list2 and group B list7.\n\nGroup A list2: [0,0,1,0]\n\nGroup B list7: [2,0,0,2]\n\nj0: A=0, B=2 \u2192 yes \u21923.\n\nj1: A=0, B=0 \u21920.\n\nj2: A=1, B=0 \u2192 yes \u21923.\n\nj3: A=0, B=2 \u2192 yes \u21923.\n\nWait, wait, group B list7 is [2,0,0,2]. j0: B=2, A=0 \u2192 yes \u21923.\n\nj1: B=0, A=0 \u21920.\n\nj2: A=1, B=0 \u2192 yes \u21923.\n\nj3: A=0, B=2 \u2192 yes \u21923.\n\nSo output list2 would be [3,0,3,3].\n\nOutput list3 corresponds to group A list3 and group B list8.\n\nGroup A list3: [1,0,1,1]\n\nGroup B list8: [0,2,0,2]\n\nj0: A=1, B=0 \u2192 yes \u21923.\n\nj1: A=0, B=2 \u2192 yes \u21923.\n\nj2: A=1, B=0 \u2192 yes \u21923.\n\nj3: A=1, B=2 \u2192 no \u21920.\n\nSo output list3: [3,3,3,0].\n\nPutting it all together, the output lists would be:\n\n[0,3,3,0]\n\n[0,3,0,3]\n\n[3,0,3,3]\n\n[3,3,3,0]\n\nBut let's look at the training examples' outputs to ensure this formatting. Each output list is enclosed in brackets and separated by newlines.\n\nSo the final answer should be:\n\n[0, 3, 3, 0]\n\n[0, 3, 0, 3]\n\n[3, 0, 3, 3]\n\n[3, 3, 3, 0]"
