        "cot_1": "Okay, let's see. I need to figure out the pattern from the training examples to solve the test input. Let me start by looking at each example and trying to find what's common between the input and output.\n\nStarting with Example 0:\nInput is three rows:\n[5,5,0]\n[5,0,5]\n[0,5,0]\nOutput is [1]. Hmm. Maybe looking at the arrangement of numbers. Let's see the positions where the non-zero numbers are. The first row has 5,5,0. Second row 5,0,5. Third 0,5,0. It looks like maybe there's a symmetry here. Like a cross pattern? Because the middle element of each row might be non-zero. Wait, the middle of the first row is 5, second row's middle is 0, third's middle is 5. Not sure. Alternatively, maybe count the number of times a certain number appears in a certain pattern.\n\nExample 1:\nInput:\n[8,0,8]\n[0,8,0]\n[8,0,8]\nOutput is [2]. The arrangement here looks like a diamond or an X shape. The 8s are at the corners and the center. So maybe the output counts the number of such X patterns. But how does that relate to the output number?\n\nWait, maybe the output is the number of times a certain pattern occurs. Let's look at all examples.\n\nExample 2's input is similar to Example 1 but with 5s. Output is also 2. So maybe when there's an X shape (like the corners and center), the output is 2. Example 1 and 2 both have that.\n\nExample 3:\nInput is:\n[0,1,1]\n[0,1,1]\n[1,0,0]\nOutput is 3. Looking at this, maybe vertical or horizontal lines? The first two rows have 1s in the second and third columns, and the third row has a 1 in the first column. Not sure. Or perhaps count the number of lines (rows or columns) that are the same. For example, the first and second rows are the same here. So two same rows and then the third row different. But output is 3. Hmm.\n\nExample 4 is similar to Example 3 but with 8s. Output is also 3. So same pattern. Let me check. The first two rows are [0,8,8], and the third is [8,0,0]. Maybe the count is related to the number of times a row has a leading zero followed by two same numbers. The first two rows each have that, and the third row starts with 8 followed by two zeros. Wait, maybe each such occurrence counts as 1, but the output is 3. So maybe the three rows each contribute something. Or perhaps the number of vertical triples. Like, looking at columns. For example, the columns might form certain patterns.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the number of distinct \"blocks\" or regions of non-zero numbers. Like in example 3, the first two rows have 1s on the right, and the third row has a 1 on the left. So three separate regions? But how?\n\nLooking at example 6:\nInput:\n[0,5,0]\n[5,5,5]\n[0,5,0]\nOutput is 6. The shape here is a cross, with the middle row all 5s and the middle column (second column) in the first and third rows. So perhaps a cross has a certain count, and that's 6. But why 6? Maybe the sum of certain elements? The sum of the cross would be 5+5+5 (middle row) plus 5 (second column in first and third rows) but that would be 5*5? Wait, no. Let's sum the elements in the cross: middle row (5+5+5) =15, plus first and third rows' middle element (5 +5) =10. Total 25. But output is 6, so that doesn't fit.\n\nWait, maybe the output is the number of non-zero elements that form a certain pattern. For example, in example 0, the non-zero elements might form a certain shape. Let's count non-zero elements in example 0: first row has two 5s, second row two 5s, third row one 5. Total 5. Output is 1. Hmm. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the count of certain symmetries or the number of lines of symmetry. For example, example 1 has an X shape which has two lines of symmetry (diagonal and the other diagonal?), but the output is 2. Example 0's input is maybe a different symmetry. Let me check example 0's input again:\n\n[5,5,0]\n[5,0,5]\n[0,5,0]\n\nThis looks like a T shape maybe? The first row is two 5s and a zero. The second row starts and ends with 5, middle is 0. Third row has a 5 in the middle. So maybe it's a T or a different shape. Output is 1.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the number of \"islands\" formed by the non-zero numbers. But example 0's input might have two separate regions: maybe the top-left 5s and the others? Not sure.\n\nLooking at example 6's output, which is 6. The input there is:\n\n[0,5,0]\n[5,5,5]\n[0,5,0]\n\nSo the cross shape. The total number of 5s is 5 (middle row has 3, first and third rows have 1 each). But output is 6. That's confusing. Maybe it's the sum divided by something. 5+5+5+5+5=25. No, not 6. Alternatively, the number of edges or connections between cells. For example, in a cross, each 5 is connected to others. But how would that total 6?\n\nWait, maybe the output is the number of times a certain digit appears in a specific pattern. For example, in example 0, the number 5 appears in positions that form a certain pattern, and the output counts how many such patterns there are. But how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is the number of distinct \"loops\" or enclosed areas in the digits when written. For example, 8 has two loops, which might contribute to a count. Let me check example 1. Input has 8s forming an X. Each 8 is two loops, but the output is 2. Hmm. Maybe the number of 8s? But example 1 has 5 8s (each row has two 8s except the middle row which has one, so 2+1+2=5). Output is 2. Not matching. Alternatively, if the 8s form two separate figures. Wait, in example 1's input, the 8s form two X shapes? Or maybe the number of times the digit 8 appears in a symmetric position. But example 4's output is 3, which has 8s in the first two rows (each has two 8s) and third row has an 8. So total 5 8s. Output 3. Not matching.\n\nAnother approach: look at the outputs. The outputs are 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 1, 6.\n\nLooking for possible patterns in the output numbers. For example, example 6's output is 6, which is the same as the digit in the input (5 and 6, but maybe not). Not sure.\n\nWait, let's think of the input as a 3x3 grid. Maybe the output is the number of certain lines or patterns in the grid. For instance, in example 6, the input forms a cross (middle row and middle column). A cross has 5 elements. The output is 6. Hmm. Maybe the sum of the positions? Let's see:\n\nIn example 6, the positions with 5s are (0,1), (1,0), (1,1), (1,2), (2,1). The sum of their indices? Let's calculate:\n\n(0,1) \u2192 0+1=1\n(1,0) \u21921+0=1\n(1,1) \u21922\n(1,2) \u21923\n(2,1) \u21923\nTotal sum: 1+1+2+3+3=10. Not 6.\n\nAlternative idea: the output might be the number of intersections or connections. For example, the cross in example 6 has a vertical and horizontal line intersecting. So maybe the number of lines (2) multiplied by something. But 2*3=6? Not sure.\n\nLooking at example 3 and 4, both have output 3. Their inputs are similar. Let's look at example 3's input:\n\n[0,1,1]\n[0,1,1]\n[1,0,0]\n\nThe first two rows are the same, and the third row is different. The first two rows have 1s in columns 2 and 3. The third row has a 1 in column 1. Maybe the output counts the number of rows with a specific pattern. For example, rows that start with 0 and have two 1s (the first two rows in example 3) each contribute 1, and the third row contributes 1, totaling 3. But then example 4 has similar structure with 8s. So two rows contribute 1 each, third row contributes 1, sum 3. That would fit.\n\nBut how does that relate to other examples? Let's check example 1:\n\nInput rows are [8,0,8], [0,8,0], [8,0,8]. Each row has two 8s except the middle row, which has one. If the middle row contributes 0, and the other rows contribute 1 each, sum would be 2, which matches the output of 2. That seems possible.\n\nIn example 0:\n\nInput rows are [5,5,0], [5,0,5], [0,5,0]. Let's see each row. First row has two 5s. Second row has two 5s. Third row has one 5. If the output counts the number of rows with two non-zero elements. So two rows contribute 1 each, third contributes 0. So total 2. But the output is 1. That doesn't fit. So maybe that's not the pattern.\n\nAnother idea: the output is the number of times the same number appears in all four corners. For example, in example 1, the four corners are 8,8,8,8. So all same. That would contribute 1. But output is 2. Hmm. Not sure.\n\nWait, looking at example 6's output being 6. Let me think of the cross shape. The cross has 5 elements. The number 5 is present 5 times, but the output is 6. Maybe 5 + 1 for the center? Not sure. Alternatively, if the cross is formed by rows and columns. The middle row and middle column. That's two lines. The middle row is length 3, middle column is length 3. But overlapping at the center. So total elements are 3 + 3 -1 =5. But output is 6. Not matching.\n\nAlternative approach: Let's think of the output as a sum of certain digits. For example, in example 0, the input has 5s. The output is 1. 5 -4=1? Not sure. Or maybe the digits sum to something. Sum of all elements in example 0: first row 5+5+0=10. Second row 5+0+5=10. Third row 0+5+0=5. Total 25. Output is 1. 25 divided by something? 25/25=1. Example 1's sum is 8+0+8=16, middle row 0+8+0=8, third row 8+0+8=16. Total 16+8+16=40. Output is 2. 40/20=2. Example 2's sum would be similar to example 1 but with 5s. Sum would be (5+0+5)*2 + 0+5+0= 10*2 +5=25. Output is 2. 25/12.5=2. Hmm, but this seems inconsistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the number of distinct numbers present. Example 0: only 5 and 0. So two distinct. Output is 1. Not matching. Example 1 has 8 and 0. Two distinct. Output is 2. No. Not matching.\n\nWait, another thought: perhaps the output is the number of times the number 0 appears in certain positions. For example, example 0 has zeros in the middle of the first row, third element, etc. But not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the count of diagonal elements. Let's check example 0's input:\n\nFirst diagonal (top-left to bottom-right): 5,0,0 \u2192 sum 5. Other diagonal (top-right to bottom-left):0,0,0 \u2192 sum 0. Not sure how that would give output 1.\n\nExample 6's input has a cross. The diagonals are 0,5,0 and 0,5,0. Sum of each is 5. Output is 6. Not helpful.\n\nHmm, this is challenging. Let me look for another pattern.\n\nLooking at example 3 and 4, both output 3. Their inputs have first two rows the same, third row different. Maybe the output counts the number of unique rows. For example, example 3 has two same rows and one different, so two unique rows. But output is 3. That doesn't fit. \n\nWait, example 3's input rows:\n\nRow 0: [0,1,1]\n\nRow 1: [0,1,1]\n\nRow 2: [1,0,0]\n\nSo rows 0 and 1 are the same, row 2 is different. So unique rows count as 2, but output is 3. Doesn't match.\n\nAlternatively, the number of columns that have all the same number. In example 3, column 0 has 0,0,1 \u2192 different. Column 1 has 1,1,0 \u2192 different. Column 2 has 1,1,0 \u2192 different. So no columns with all same. Output is 3. Not matching.\n\nWait, maybe the output is the sum of the middle row and middle column. Example 0's middle row is [5,0,5]. Sum is 10. Middle column is 5,0,5. Sum 10. Total 20. Output is 1. Not matching.\n\nAnother idea: the output is the count of certain patterns, like vertical, horizontal, or diagonal lines. For example, example 6's output is 6. Maybe the cross has two lines (middle row and middle column), so 2 lines. But output is 6. Maybe each line is counted as length. Middle row has length 3, middle column has length 3. 3+3=6. Oh! That could make sense. Let's check other examples.\n\nExample 0's input has a middle row sum of 10 and middle column sum of 5+0+5=10. But if we count the lengths. The middle row is length 3. The middle column is also length 3. But in example 0's input, the middle column is 5 (from row 0), 0 (row1), 5 (row2). So the middle column has non-zero elements at top and bottom. So the middle column isn't a full line. So maybe the lines need to be all non-zero. For example, in example 6, the middle row is all 5s (full line), and the middle column is all 5s (since rows 0, 1, 2 have 5 in the middle). So two lines, each of length 3. Summing the lengths:3+3=6. Which matches the output of 6. Oh! That's possible.\n\nLet's check other examples. Example 1's input is:\n\n[8,0,8]\n\n[0,8,0]\n\n[8,0,8]\n\nThe diagonals here are top-left to bottom-right:8,8,8. And the other diagonal:8,8,8. So two diagonal lines, each length 3. Sum 3+3=6. But the output is 2. Hmm, that doesn't fit. But maybe the count of lines instead of summing lengths. So two lines (two diagonals), output 2. That matches example1's output of 2. Example2's input is similar to example1 but with 5s. So two diagonal lines, output 2. Which matches.\n\nExample0's input:\n\n[5,5,0]\n\n[5,0,5]\n\n[0,5,0]\n\nLooking for lines (horizontal, vertical, diagonal) that are all non-zero. The first row has [5,5,0] which isn't a full line. Middle row [5,0,5] not full. Third row [0,5,0] not full. Columns: first column is 5,5,0 (not full). Second column 5,0,5 (not full). Third column 0,5,0 (not full). Diagonals: 5,0,0 and 0,0,0. So no full lines. So output is 0, but the example0's output is 1. Hmm, that contradicts.\n\nWait, maybe the lines don't have to be all non-zero. Maybe it's the number of lines (horizontal, vertical, or diagonal) where the sum is non-zero and forms a certain pattern. Or perhaps the number of lines where the sum is equal to a certain multiple.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is the number of lines (rows, columns, diagonals) that have exactly two non-zero elements. Let's check example0. Rows: first row has two 5s, second row two 5s, third row one 5. Columns: first column two 5s, second column three 5s (rows 0:5, row1:0, row2:5 \u2192 wait no, row0's second column is 5, row1's is 0, row2's is 5. So two non-zero. Third column: row0:0, row1:5, row2:0. So one non-zero. So total lines (rows and columns) with exactly two non-zero elements: two rows and two columns (first and second columns?), but not sure. Diagonals: example0's diagonals have one and zero non-zero. So total maybe 4 lines (two rows and two columns) but output is 1. Doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, the output is the number of \"L\" shapes. Like in example0's input, maybe there's an L-shaped arrangement. But I'm not sure.\n\nAnother angle: looking at example3 and 4. Their output is 3. Let's check example3's input:\n\nRows are [0,1,1], [0,1,1], [1,0,0]. Maybe the output is the number of times the number 1 appears in the first column plus the number of times it appears in the third column. First column has two 0s and one 1. Third column has two 1s and one 0. So 1 (from first column) + 2 (third column) =3. Output is 3. That fits. Example4's input: first column has two 0s and one 8, third column has two 8s and one 0. So 1+2=3. Output 3. That works.\n\nHow about example1: first column has 8,0,8 \u2192 two 8s. Third column has 8,0,8 \u2192 two 8s. Sum is 2+2=4. But output is 2. Doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. So this pattern works for examples3 and4, but not others. So maybe the pattern varies. Maybe the output is the sum of the number of non-zero elements in the first and third columns. Example3: first column has 0,0,1 \u2192 1 non-zero. Third column has 1,1,0 \u2192 2. Sum 3. Output 3. Example4: first column 0,0,8 \u21921. Third column 8,8,0 \u21922. Sum 3. Output 3. Example1: first and third columns each have 2 non-zero (8s), sum 4. Output is 2. Not matching. So this only works for examples3 and4.\n\nAnother approach: maybe the output is the number of times a certain number appears in the entire grid divided by some factor. For example, example0 has 5 appearing 5 times (I think). 5 divided by 5 is 1. Output is 1. Example1 has 8 appearing 5 times. 5 divided by something gives 2. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the output is the count of the number of times a number appears in the grid divided by the maximum occurrence. For example, in example0, 5 occurs 5 times, 0 occurs 4 times. 5/5=1. Output is 1. Example1: 8 appears 5 times, 0 appears 4 times. 5/5=1, but output is 2. So that doesn't work.\n\nWait, maybe the output is the number of pairs of identical rows. Example3 has two identical rows (rows0 and1), which is one pair. Output is3. Doesn't fit. Example1 has three rows, all different? No, example1's rows are [8,0,8], [0,8,0], [8,0,8]. Rows0 and2 are the same. So one pair. Output is2. Doesn't fit.\n\nAlternative idea: the output is the number of cells that are equal to their mirror position. For example, in example1's grid, the cell (0,0)=8 and (0,2)=8 \u2192 mirror around the vertical axis. Similarly, (2,0)=8 and (2,2)=8. Middle row's middle cell is 8. So how many such mirror pairs? For each cell, check if it equals its mirror. For example1, the grid is symmetric along both the vertical and horizontal axes. Let's count the number of cells that are equal to their mirror. For example:\n\nCell (0,0) mirrors with (0,2): both are 8. So each contributes to a pair. But since we can't count both, maybe count each pair once. There are two such pairs (top row corners and bottom row corners). Also the middle cell (1,1) is 8, which is its own mirror. So total of 2 pairs +1 cell \u2192 but output is2. Hmm. Maybe each pair counts as 1 and the middle cell counts as 1. So 2 pairs (4 cells) and 1 cell \u2192 total 3. Not matching output 2.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Let's try to find another pattern.\n\nLooking at example6's input:\n\n[0,5,0]\n[5,5,5]\n[0,5,0]\n\nThe output is6. The middle row and middle column form a cross. The sum of the cross elements is 5*5=25, which is not 6. But if the cross has 5 elements, maybe 5+1=6. Or the count of elements plus 1. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the number of 'arms' in the cross. A cross has four arms (up, down, left, right) and a center. But that's 5 parts, but output is6. Not matching.\n\nAnother approach: maybe the output is the number of cells that are surrounded by the same number. For example, in example6's middle cell is surrounded by 5s. But not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the output is the number of adjacent pairs of the same number. For example, in example6's cross:\n\nEach element in the cross is adjacent to others. Let's count horizontal and vertical adjacents. The middle row has three 5s, which form two horizontal adjacents. The middle column has three 5s, forming two vertical adjacents. Additionally, the center is connected to both. Total adjacents: horizontal (5,5 and 5,5) \u2192 2, vertical (5,5 and 5,5) \u21922. Total 4. But output is6. Not matching.\n\nWait, maybe the number of times two same numbers are adjacent (including diagonally). Let's see:\n\nExample6's input:\n\nRow0:0,5,0 \u2192 adjacent vertically to row1's 5,5,5. So in row0, the middle 5 is adjacent below to row1's 5. Then row1's 5s: each adjacent to others. The middle 5 is adjacent to all four directions. So perhaps this is getting too complicated.\n\nAnother Idea: Maybe the output is the count of even or odd occurrences. Example0's output is1 (odd). Example1's is2 (even). Not sure.\n\nLet me try to summarize possible patterns:\n\nLooking at examples where output is the same:\n\n- Examples1 and2: output2. Their inputs have X patterns (diagonals with same numbers).\n\n- Examples3 and4: output3. Their inputs have two identical rows and a different third row.\n\n- Examples0 and5: output1. Their inputs seem to have a T-shape or similar.\n\n- Example6: output6. Cross shape.\n\nSo perhaps the output depends on the shape formed by the non-zero elements.\n\nPossible mappings:\n\n- X shape (diagonals) \u2192 output2.\n\n- Two identical rows and a different third \u2192 output3.\n\n- T-shape \u2192 output1.\n\n- Cross shape \u2192 output6.\n\nIf that's the case, then the test input is:\n\n[0,8,0]\n\n[8,8,8]\n\n[0,8,0]\n\nThis is a cross shape (middle row and middle column are all 8s). So according to example6, which has a cross and outputs6, the test input should output6. But wait, example6's output is6, but the test input's middle row is [8,8,8], and middle column is [0 (row0),8 (row1),0 (row2)]? Wait no. Let's check the test input again:\n\nTest Input:\n\nRow0: [0,8,0]\n\nRow1: [8,8,8]\n\nRow2: [0,8,0]\n\nThe middle column (second column) is:\n\nRow0:8, row1:8, row2:8. So all 8s. And middle row (row1) is all 8s. So it's a cross shape, just like example6. So the output should be6. But let's check the training examples:\n\nExample6's input is:\n\n[0,5,0]\n\n[5,5,5]\n\n[0,5,0]\n\nWhich is the same structure as the test input. Output is6. So the test input's output should be6. But wait, example6's input has 5s, and the output is6. So the output isn't related to the number itself (5 or8), but the shape. So yes, test input should output6.",

        "cot_2": "Okay, let's tackle this puzzle. I need to figure out the pattern that transforms the given input matrices into their respective outputs. Let's start by looking at the training examples one by one to see if I can spot any commonalities or rules.\n\nStarting with Example 0:\nInput:\n[5, 5, 0]\n[5, 0, 5]\n[0, 5, 0]\nOutput: [1]\n\nHmm. The matrix is 3x3. Maybe the output is related to the arrangement of numbers. Let's check the other examples to see if there's a pattern.\n\nExample 1:\nInput:\n[8, 0, 8]\n[0, 8, 0]\n[8, 0, 8]\nOutput: [2]\n\nThis one has a sort of symmetry. The first and third rows are [8,0,8], and the middle row is [0,8,0]. The output is 2.\n\nExample 2:\nInput:\n[5, 0, 5]\n[0, 5, 0]\n[5, 0, 5]\nOutput: [2]\n\nThis looks similar to Example 1's structure but with 5s. The output is also 2. So maybe symmetry plays a role here. Let's see what's different between Example 0 and Example 1. Example 0's output is 1, while similar structures (like Examples 1 and 2) give 2.\n\nLooking at Example 0 again, the first row is [5,5,0], middle is [5,0,5], and last is [0,5,0]. Maybe it's the count of some specific pattern or the number of certain elements. Let's check the numbers. The sum? Let's see: For Example 0, the sum of all elements is 5+5+0 +5+0+5 +0+5+0 = 25. Output is 1. Example 1's sum is 8*6 =48, output 2. That doesn't seem directly related. So sum might not be the key.\n\nWhat about the positions of zeros and non-zeros? Let's visualize the matrices. Maybe the pattern is related to the number of loops or enclosed areas in the number's digits. For example, 8 has two loops, 0 has one, 1 has none, etc. But let's check if that aligns.\n\nExample 0's first row has 5,5,0. 5 has no loops. 0 has one. The middle row 5,0,5. So maybe each 0 in certain positions contributes to the count. But the output here is 1. Hmm. Maybe that's not it.\n\nLooking at Example 3:\nInput:\n[0,1,1]\n[0,1,1]\n[1,0,0]\nOutput: [3]\n\nThe numbers here are 1s and 0s. The output is 3. If considering the count of 1s: let's count. First row has two 1s, second two, third one. Total of 5. Not 3. So not that. Alternatively, maybe it's the number of times a certain pattern occurs. Like, how many times a 1 is surrounded by 0s or something. Alternatively, maybe it's the number of \"blocks\" of non-zero numbers. Let's see. In Example 3, the first two rows have 0s followed by 1s. The third row starts with 1 then two 0s. So maybe there are three distinct regions of 1s? Not sure.\n\nAnother approach: Maybe the output is related to the number of \"crosses\" or certain shapes in the matrix. For instance, in Example 6:\nInput:\n[0,5,0]\n[5,5,5]\n[0,5,0]\nOutput: [6]\n\nThis looks like a cross shape (a plus sign) with 5s. The output is 6. Wait, 5's loop count? No, 5 doesn't have loops. Maybe the sum of the numbers? 5 appears 5 times (the cross), sum is 5*5=25. Output is 6. That doesn't add up. Alternatively, the cross has 5 elements (the center and four arms), but here the cross is 5 elements (the center is 5, then up, down, left, right each 5). So 5 elements. But output is 6. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe the output is the sum of the digits in the cross. Wait, in Example 6, the cross is made up of 5s. The cross has 5 elements (assuming the cross is the middle row and the middle column). So 5*5=25, but output is 6. So that's not it.\n\nLet me think again. Maybe the numbers in the matrix aren't the actual digits but represent something else. For example, maybe the output counts the number of times a certain digit appears in specific positions. Let's check.\n\nLooking at Example 0's output [1]. The matrix has 5s and 0s. Maybe the number 5 is in positions that form a certain pattern. For instance, in Example 0, the 5s are arranged in a sort of 'T' shape. The first row has two 5s, the middle row starts and ends with 5, and the third row has a 5 in the middle. But how does that lead to output 1?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the number of times a particular digit forms a loop around the matrix. Wait, maybe considering the matrix as a grid and counting enclosed areas. For example, in Example 0, if the 5s are considered as walls, maybe there's one enclosed area. But how would that work?\n\nWait, looking at Example 6 again: the input is a cross. The output is 6. 5 is the number used. 5 has no enclosed areas. So maybe that's not it.\n\nAlternative approach: Let's look for the outputs and see if they relate to the count of some specific feature. Let's list all outputs:\n\nExample 0: 1\n\nExample 1:2\n\nExample 2:2\n\nExample3:3\n\nExample4:3\n\nExample5:1 (similar to Example0)\n\nExample6:6\n\nHmm. So outputs are 1,2,3,6. Maybe the output is the number of \"islands\" or connected regions of non-zero numbers. Let's check.\n\nExample0's matrix:\n\nRow0:5,5,0\n\nRow1:5,0,5\n\nRow2:0,5,0\n\nIf we connect adjacent non-zeros (including diagonally?), maybe the number of separate regions. Let's see:\n\nRow0 has 5,5 connected. Row1's first 5 is connected to row0's first 5. Then row1's third 5 is connected to row0's 5 (since they are adjacent diagonally? Wait, if adjacency is only up/down/left/right, not diagonally, then:\n\nRow0: two 5s connected. Row1 has first 5 connected to row0's first 5. Then row1's third 5 is isolated from the others if adjacency is only lateral. Then row2's middle 5 is connected to row1's third 5 (if vertical adjacency). So maybe two regions? But output is 1. Hmm. That's conflicting.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the number of rows that are all non-zero. For example, in Example6, the middle row is [5,5,5], which is all non-zero. But output is 6, which isn't 1. So that's not it.\n\nAnother thought: Maybe the output is the number of times the middle element appears in the matrix. For Example0, middle element is 0. The count of 0s is ... Let's see: Row0: one 0. Row1: two 0s. Row2: two 0s. Total 5 zeros. Output is 1. No connection.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the count of the middle element. Wait, in Example0, middle element is 0. The number of 0s is 5. Output is 1. Not matching. In Example1, middle element is 8. Number of 8s: let's count. Row0: two 8s. Row1: one. Row2: two. Total 5. Output is 2. No. Example2 middle is 5. Count of 5s: similar to example1, maybe 5. Output is 2. Not matching.\n\nHmm. Let's think of other possibilities. Maybe the output is the number of distinct elements in the matrix. Example0 has 5 and 0, so 2 distinct elements. Output is 1. No. Example1 has 8 and 0, two elements. Output 2. Maybe that fits. Example3 has 0,1,1,1,0,0. So 0 and 1. Two elements. Output is 3. Doesn't fit. So that's not it.\n\nWait, maybe the output is the sum of the digits in the middle row. For Example0, middle row is [5,0,5], sum is 10. Output 1. Not matching. Example1: middle row [0,8,0], sum 8. Output 2. Not matching. Example6's middle row sum is 15. Output 6. Hmm, 15 and 6: 15 is 5*3, output 6. Doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the sum of the middle row's digits divided by something. For example, Example1's middle row sum 8. Output 2. 8/4=2. Not sure. Example6's middle row sum 15. 15/2.5=6. That's possible. But why divide by 2.5? That seems arbitrary.\n\nAnother angle: Let's look at the positions where non-zero elements are. Maybe the output counts the number of non-zero elements in certain positions. For example, the corners, edges, etc.\n\nExample0's non-zero positions:\n\nRow0: positions 0 and 1 (5s)\n\nRow1: positions 0 and 2 (5s)\n\nRow2: position 1 (5)\n\nSo the non-zeros are at (0,0), (0,1), (1,0), (1,2), (2,1). That's 5 elements. Output is 1. Hmm.\n\nExample1's non-zeros:\n\nRow0: 0 and 2 (8s)\n\nRow1: 1 (8)\n\nRow2: 0 and 2 (8s)\n\nSo positions (0,0), (0,2), (1,1), (2,0), (2,2). That's 5 elements. Output is 2.\n\nHmm. Not sure. Maybe the number of times a certain pattern occurs. For example, in Example0 and Example5, the output is 1, and their matrices look similar but with different numbers. Let's compare:\n\nExample0:\n\n[5,5,0]\n\n[5,0,5]\n\n[0,5,0]\n\nExample5:\n\n[4,4,0]\n\n[4,0,4]\n\n[0,4,0]\n\nThey have the same structure. The output is 1 in both. So maybe the structure determines the output. Let's see what structure this is. It looks like a kind of diagonal cross maybe. Like, the non-zeros are in positions that form a sort of X shape, but not exactly. Let me visualize:\n\nIn Example0, the non-zero elements are in (0,0), (0,1), (1,0), (1,2), (2,1). So it's like a sort of 'H' shape? Or a diamond?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern forms the number 1. But the output here is 1, but the structure isn't obvious.\n\nWait, looking at Example6's input:\n\n[0,5,0]\n\n[5,5,5]\n\n[0,5,0]\n\nThis forms a cross (middle row and middle column). The output is 6. So maybe when the non-zero elements form a cross (like a plus sign), the output is 6. But why 6?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the sum of the cross elements. For Example6, the cross has 5 elements (middle row and middle column). But the sum is 5*5=25. Output is 6. Doesn't fit.\n\nWait, 5 in the cross, and the output is 6. 5+1=6? Not sure.\n\nAnother observation: The outputs 1,2,3,6 could relate to the number of lines of symmetry in the matrix. For example, Example1's matrix has vertical and horizontal symmetry (the 8s form an X shape?), so maybe 2 lines of symmetry. Output is 2. Example0's matrix may have one line of symmetry. Let's check:\n\nExample0's matrix:\n\nRow0:5,5,0\n\nRow1:5,0,5\n\nRow2:0,5,0\n\nIf we check vertical symmetry (mirror down the middle column), the first column is [5,5,0], the third column is [0,5,0]. Not symmetric. Horizontal symmetry? Row0 is [5,5,0], row2 is [0,5,0]. Not the same. Diagonal symmetry? Maybe diagonal from top-left to bottom-right. The (0,0) is 5, (1,1) is 0, (2,2) is 0. The mirror positions (0,2) is 0, (1,1) 0, (2,0) 0. Not symmetric. So maybe one line of symmetry, but which one?\n\nAlternatively, rotational symmetry. Example1's matrix, when rotated 180 degrees, looks the same. So rotational symmetry of order 2. Output is 2. That could fit. Example0's matrix, if rotated 180 degrees, does it look the same? Let's see:\n\nOriginal:\n\n5 5 0\n\n5 0 5\n\n0 5 0\n\nRotated 180 degrees (so rows reversed and elements reversed in each row):\n\n0 5 0\n\n5 0 5\n\n0 5 5 \u2192 which is not the same as original. So no, that's not the case.\n\nHmm. This approach isn't working.\n\nBack to the cross idea in Example6. Output is 6. The cross is made of 5s. Maybe the output is the sum of the digits in the cross. 5+5+5+5+5=25. Output is 6. Not matching. Or 5 (number of elements) plus 1? 5+1=6. Maybe. Let's check other examples.\n\nExample1's cross: does it have a cross? Let's see. Example1's matrix:\n\n8 0 8\n\n0 8 0\n\n8 0 8\n\nThe middle element is 8. The cross here would be the middle row and middle column. Middle row is [0,8,0], middle column is [0,8,0]. So the cross elements are (1,1) and the middle row and column. But in this matrix, the cross would be the middle 8. But the rest are zeros. So the cross has one element. But output is 2. So that approach doesn't fit.\n\nAnother thought: The output might be the count of the number of times the pattern forms a certain digit when viewed as a grid. For example, the matrix could represent a digital number display. Like, a 3x3 grid that forms digits similar to a seven-segment display. For example, the output [6] might correspond to the digit 6 in the matrix. Let's see Example6's matrix:\n\n0 5 0\n\n5 5 5\n\n0 5 0\n\nIf we imagine this as a seven-segment display, maybe the middle row being all 5s (the middle segment) and the vertical segments on the left and right. Wait, the seven-segment digits have certain patterns. Let me think:\n\nDigit 6 has the segments: top, upper-left, middle, lower-left, bottom, lower-right. So in a 3x3 grid:\n\nTop row: left and middle segments.\n\nMiddle row: left, middle, right.\n\nBottom row: left, middle, right.\n\nBut I'm not sure. Let me visualize Example6's matrix:\n\nRow0: 0,5,0 \u2192 maybe the top segment is off, middle is on? Not sure. Alternatively, maybe the arrangement forms a '6' shape. If the matrix's non-zero elements form the shape of the digit 6, then the output is 6. Let's check:\n\nIn Example6's matrix:\n\nRow0: 0,5,0 \u2192 perhaps only the middle element is on (like the top segment is off, and the upper-middle is on? Not sure. Alternatively, the middle row has all three elements (left, middle, right), and the bottom row has left and right. Hmm, maybe not. But the output is 6. This could be a stretch, but maybe.\n\nExample3's output is 3. Let's check if the matrix forms a '3'. The input is:\n\n0,1,1\n\n0,1,1\n\n1,0,0\n\nHmm. If we imagine this as a seven-segment display, maybe the right segments are on. Top row: right two are on (1,1). Middle row: right two. Bottom row: left is on. Not sure how that would form a 3. Alternatively, maybe it's a different kind of pattern.\n\nAlternatively, the number of distinct geometric shapes formed by the non-zero elements. For example, in Example0, maybe there's one shape. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the count of non-zero elements in the outer perimeter of the matrix. Let's check Example0:\n\nPerimeter elements are the first and third rows and the first and third columns. For Example0:\n\nRow0: 5,5,0 \u2192 three elements.\n\nRow2:0,5,0 \u2192 one element.\n\nColumns 0: 5,5,0 \u2192 three elements (sum?), but non-zero elements: 5,5,0 \u2192 two non-zero.\n\nColumn 2: 0,5,0 \u2192 one non-zero (5 in row1, column2). So total perimeter non-zeros: row0 has two (5,5), row2 has one (5), column0 has two (5,5), column2 has one (5). But wait, this may be overlapping. Let's count all perimeter positions:\n\nTop row (all elements): [5,5,0] \u2192 non-zeros: 2.\n\nBottom row: [0,5,0] \u2192 non-zero: 1.\n\nLeft column (excluding top and bottom): [5,0] \u2192 non-zero: 1.\n\nRight column (excluding top and bottom): [5,0] \u2192 non-zero: 1.\n\nSo total perimeter non-zeros: 2 (top) + 1 (bottom) +1 (left) +1 (right) =5. But output is 1. Doesn't match.\n\nAnother approach: Let's look at the number of times the same number appears in the same row or column. For example, in Example0, each row has two 5s and one 0. But output is 1. Not sure.\n\nWait, let's consider the number of 'islands' of non-zero numbers where an island is a group of adjacent non-zero numbers (considering up, down, left, right). Let's test this.\n\nExample0's matrix:\n\n5 5 0\n\n5 0 5\n\n0 5 0\n\nLooking for connected regions of 5s.\n\nRow0: positions (0,0) and (0,1) are connected. Then (0,0) is connected to (1,0). (1,0) is connected to (0,0). (1,2) is connected to (2,1) via (1,2) and (2,1) are diagonally adjacent? If adjacency is only up, down, left, right, then (1,2) is not connected to (2,1). So the regions would be:\n\n- (0,0), (0,1), (1,0)\n\n- (1,2), (2,1)\n\nWait, (1,2) is 5. Is there a connection to other 5s?\n\nFrom (1,2), adjacent cells are (0,2) (0), (1,1) (0), (2,2) (0), and (1,3) which doesn't exist. So (1,2) is isolated. Then (2,1) is 5, connected to (1,1) (0), (2,0) (0), (2,2) (0), so it's also isolated. So three regions? But output is 1. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternative, if diagonal adjacency counts. Then (1,2) can connect to (2,1). So then the regions would be:\n\n- (0,0), (0,1), (1,0)\n\n- (1,2), (2,1)\n\nSo two regions. But output is 1. So this doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. This is getting frustrating. Let me try another angle.\n\nLooking at Example3:\n\nInput:\n\n0,1,1\n\n0,1,1\n\n1,0,0\n\nOutput:3\n\nMaybe the number of 1s in the upper-right 2x2 corner. Let's see. The first two rows have two 1s each in the right two columns. That's four. The third row has one 1. Total 5. Output is3. Doesn't match.\n\nAlternatively, the number of rows that have exactly two 1s. Rows 0 and 1 each have two 1s. That's two. Output is 3. Not matching.\n\nWait, maybe the number of columns with exactly two 1s. Column1 has two 1s (row0 and row1). Column2 has two 1s (row0 and row1). So two columns. Output is3. No.\n\nAnother idea: The output is the number of \"corner\" elements that are non-zero. For Example0, the corners are (0,0)=5, (0,2)=0, (2,0)=0, (2,2)=0. Only one non-zero. Output is1. That matches. Let's check Example1:\n\nCorners are (0,0)=8, (0,2)=8, (2,0)=8, (2,2)=8. All non-zero. So four corners. Output is2. Doesn't match. So that's not it.\n\nWait, maybe the number of pairs of opposite corners that are non-zero. For Example1, all four corners are non-zero. Pairs are (0,0) and (2,2), (0,2) and (2,0). Both pairs have non-zero. So two pairs. Output is2. That matches. Example0 has only (0,0) as a non-zero corner. No pairs. Output is1. So maybe output is the number of pairs of opposite corners that are non-zero. Let's check other examples.\n\nExample2's input:\n\n[5,0,5]\n\n[0,5,0]\n\n[5,0,5]\n\nCorners: (0,0)=5, (0,2)=5, (2,0)=5, (2,2)=5. So two pairs: (0,0)-(2,2) and (0,2)-(2,0). Both pairs are non-zero. Output is2. That fits. Example3's input:\n\n[0,1,1]\n\n[0,1,1]\n\n[1,0,0]\n\nCorners: (0,0)=0, (0,2)=1, (2,0)=1, (2,2)=0. Pairs: (0,2)-(2,0) are both non-zero (1 and 1). So one pair. Output is3. Doesn't fit. Hmm. So this idea works for Examples 0,1,2, but not 3. So maybe it's part of the pattern but not the whole story.\n\nExample3's output is3. According to the previous idea, it should be1. So maybe there's another component.\n\nAnother observation: Let's look at Example3 and Example4. Both have output3. Example3's matrix:\n\n0 1 1\n\n0 1 1\n\n1 0 0\n\nExample4's matrix:\n\n0 8 8\n\n0 8 8\n\n8 0 0\n\nThey have the same structure, just different non-zero numbers. So perhaps the pattern depends on the arrangement, not the specific numbers. \n\nLooking at Example3's matrix, maybe there are three 'L' shapes. The first two rows have the right two elements as 1s, forming a vertical line. The third row has a single 1 on the left. Maybe three separate regions. But when considering connectivity, if adjacency includes vertical and horizontal, then the first two rows' 1s are connected (right two columns, two rows). The third row's 1 is separate. So two regions. But output is3. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAnother idea: Maybe the output is the number of times the digit in the matrix (like 1, 8, etc.) has a certain number of enclosed areas. For example, 8 has two enclosed areas, 0 has one, 1 has none, etc. Then, sum the enclosed areas across the matrix.\n\nExample1's input has four 8s in the corners and one in the middle. Each 8 contributes 2. So total is 5 *2 =10. Output is2. No. Example4's input has 8s: count how many 8s? Let's see:\n\nExample4's input:\n\n0 8 8\n\n0 8 8\n\n8 0 0\n\nNon-zero elements: row0 has two 8s, row1 two 8s, row2 one 8. Total 5. Each 8 contributes 2. So 5*2=10. Output is3. Doesn't match.\n\nExample3's input has 1s. Each 1 contributes 0. So sum is zero. Output is3. Doesn't fit. So this idea is wrong.\n\nAlternative approach: Maybe the output is the number of rows that are palindromic. For example, a row that reads the same forwards and backwards.\n\nExample0's rows:\n\nRow0:5,5,0 \u2192 not a palindrome.\n\nRow1:5,0,5 \u2192 palindrome.\n\nRow2:0,5,0 \u2192 palindrome.\n\nSo two palindromic rows. Output is1. Doesn't match.\n\nExample1's rows:\n\nRow0:8,0,8 \u2192 palindrome.\n\nRow1:0,8,0 \u2192 palindrome.\n\nRow2:8,0,8 \u2192 palindrome.\n\nThree palindromic rows. Output is2. Doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. This is challenging. Let me think of another angle. Perhaps the output is the number of different types of rows present. For example, in Example0:\n\nRow0:5,5,0\n\nRow1:5,0,5\n\nRow2:0,5,0\n\nSo three unique rows. Output is1. Doesn't match.\n\nExample1 has rows [8,0,8], [0,8,0], [8,0,8]. Unique rows are two (since first and third are same). Output is2. That matches. Example2's rows are [5,0,5], [0,5,0], [5,0,5]. So two unique rows. Output is2. Also matches. Example0's output is1. But there are three unique rows. So this idea fits for Examples1 and 2, but not Example0. \n\nWait, perhaps the output is the number of unique row types minus 1. Example1 has two unique rows: 2-1=1. Output is2. No. So that's not it.\n\nWait, Example3's input has three rows:\n\n[0,1,1], [0,1,1], [1,0,0]. Unique rows are two (first and second are same). Output is3. Doesn't fit.\n\nAnother approach: Maybe the output is the number of distinct 2x2 submatrices that are present in the matrix. For example, in Example0:\n\nPossible 2x2 submatrices:\n\nTop-left: [5,5;5,0]\n\nTop-right: [5,0;0,5]\n\nMiddle-left: [5,0;0,5]\n\nMiddle-right: [0,5;5,0]\n\nBottom-left: [0,5;5,0]\n\nBottom-right: [5,0;0,5]\n\nWait, but this is getting too complicated. Let's count distinct submatrices. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the output could be the number of different digits present. For example, Example0 has two digits (5 and 0). Output is1. Doesn't fit. Example1 has two digits. Output is2. So maybe output is number of different digits minus 1. Example1:2-1=1. Output is2. Not matching.\n\nWait, Example6's output is6. The matrix has only 5 and 0. Two digits. So this idea is invalid.\n\nLet me think of the Test Input:\n\nTest Input:\n\n[0,8,0]\n\n[8,8,8]\n\n[0,8,0]\n\nThe matrix is:\n\nRow0:0,8,0\n\nRow1:8,8,8\n\nRow2:0,8,0\n\nThis looks like a vertical line in the middle column. So the middle column is all 8s, and the middle row is all 8s. So a cross shape, similar to Example6. But in Example6, the output is6. This test input's cross is middle row and column. So output might be6. But let's check Example6's input:\n\nExample6's input:\n\n[0,5,0]\n\n[5,5,5]\n\n[0,5,0]\n\nOutput is6.\n\nSo this test case is similar. So maybe the output is6. But let's check other examples. Example3's output is3, but the structure is different.\n\nWait, the test input's matrix forms a cross like Example6. So if the pattern is that a cross results in output6, then the test output should be6. But let's check why Example6's output is6. Maybe the cross has 5 elements (middle row and column). Example6's cross has 5 5s. 5 +1=6? Or 5 elements, output is5. But output is6. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the sum of the digits in the cross. For Example6's cross (middle row and column), the sum is 5+5+5+5+5=25. Output is6. No. But 2+5=7. Not 6.\n\nAlternatively, the product of the digits in the cross. 5*5*5*5*5=3125. No.\n\nAlternatively, the count of the cross elements. Example6's cross has 5 elements. Output is6. 5+1=6. But why add 1? Maybe if the cross has an odd number of elements, but not sure.\n\nTest input's cross has middle row and column:\n\nMiddle row:8,8,8 (3 elements)\n\nMiddle column:8 (from row0), 8 (row1), 8 (row2) \u2192 3 elements. But the center element is counted once. So total cross elements are 3 +3 -1 =5. So 5 elements. If the pattern is outputting 5+1=6, then test output would be6. Which aligns with Example6's output. But why add 1? Maybe the cross forms a '+' sign, which has 5 elements, and the output is5+1=6. Not sure. But the test input's cross would then have 5 elements, leading to output6. But Example1 and others don't fit this pattern.\n\nBut let's look at Example1's matrix again:\n\n[8,0,8]\n\n[0,8,0]\n\n[8,0,8]\n\nThe non-zero elements form an X shape (the diagonals). So the cross here is the diagonals. The output is2. If the cross has 5 elements (the four corners and the center), then 5 elements. But output is2. So this pattern doesn't fit.\n\nAlternative, the X shape (diagonal) in Example1 has 5 elements. Output is2. Which doesn't align.\n\nSo perhaps the cross (vertical and horizontal) leads to output6, while the X shape leads to output2. So for the test input, which has a vertical and horizontal cross (like Example6), the output should be6.\n\nSo applying this pattern, the test input would output6.\n\nBut let's check Example0 and Example5's output is1. Their matrices look like they have an X shape but with some elements missing. Let's see:\n\nExample0:\n\n5 5 0\n\n5 0 5\n\n0 5 0\n\nThe non-zero elements form a sort of diamond shape. Not a perfect X. So maybe the output is1 when the pattern is incomplete, and output2 when the X is perfect. Example1 and 2 have perfect X shapes with 5 non-zero elements (the four corners and center), but their outputs are2. So perhaps the number of diagonals present. For example, an X has two diagonals, so output2. A cross has two lines (vertical and horizontal), so output would be2, but Example6's cross outputs6. So this idea doesn't hold.\n\nAlternatively, the number of lines of symmetry. Example6's cross is symmetrical in two lines (vertical and horizontal), so output6. But Example1's X shape has two lines of symmetry (the two diagonals), output2. So maybe output is twice the number of lines of symmetry. For Example1, 2 lines \u2192 output2. Example6 has two lines \u2192 output2*3=6? Not sure where 3 comes from. This seems forced.\n\nAlternatively, the output is the number of non-zero elements in the cross multiplied by something. Example6's cross has5 elements. Output6. 5*1.2=6. Not helpful.\n\nThis is really challenging. Let's try to find a pattern that fits all examples.\n\nLooking at all examples:\n\nExample0: Output1.\n\nMatrix structure:\n\nRow0: 5,5,0\n\nRow1:5,0,5\n\nRow2:0,5,0\n\nNon-zero elements are arranged in a diamond shape with a missing center. Maybe the output is the number of enclosed areas. But I don't see any enclosed area. \n\nExample1: Output2.\n\nMatrix has X shape. \n\nExample2: Output2.\n\nSame as Example1 but with 5s.\n\nExample3: Output3.\n\nMatrix has non-zeros in the right two columns of the first two rows, and left column of third row.\n\nExample4: Same structure as Example3, output3.\n\nExample5: Same structure as Example0, output1.\n\nExample6: Cross shape, output6.\n\nTest input: Cross shape like Example6, so output6.\n\nBut why does Example6's cross output6? Maybe the number of non-zero elements in the cross. Example6's cross has5 elements. 5 +1=6. Test input's cross has5 elements. So output6.\n\nBut Example3 has5 non-zero elements (two in first row, two in second, one in third). Output3. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the sum of the non-zero elements divided by some factor. Example6's sum is5*5=25. 25 divided by4 is6.25. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, the number of non-zero elements in the cross. For Example6, 5 elements \u2192 output6. So 5+1=6. For Test input, 5 elements \u2192 output6.\n\nExample1's X shape has5 elements (four corners and center), output2. 5-3=2. Not helpful.\n\nHmm. This is tough. Let's think differently. Maybe the output is the count of the number of times a certain digit appears in the matrix. For example, Example0 has five 5s. Output1. Example1 has five 8s. Output2. Example3 has five 1s. Output3. Wait, that's interesting. Let's check:\n\nExample0: five 5s \u2192 output1. But 5 is the count of 5s. 5 mod 4 =1. Not sure.\n\nExample1: five 8s \u2192 output2. 5 mod 3=2.\n\nExample3: five 1s \u2192 output3. 5 mod 2=1. Doesn't fit.\n\nExample4: five 8s \u2192 output3. 5 mod something else. Doesn't fit.\n\nExample6: five 5s \u2192 output6. 5 mod something. Not helpful.\n\nNo, that doesn't work.\n\nAlternative idea: The output is the number of non-zero elements in the middle row plus the middle column, minus the center element (since it's counted twice).\n\nFor Example6's middle row has3 5s, middle column has3 5s. Total 3+3-1=5. Output is6. 5+1=6.\n\nTest input: middle row has3 8s, middle column has3 8s. Total 3+3-1=5. Output would be5+1=6. Which matches Example6's logic.\n\nExample1's middle row has1 8, middle column has1 8. So 1+1-1=1. Output is2. Doesn't fit.\n\nExample0's middle row has two 5s, middle column has two 5s. So 2+2-1=3. Output is1. Doesn't fit.\n\nSo this idea only works for Example6 and the test input, but not others.\n\nAnother approach: The output could be related to the digital root of the sum of all elements.\n\nExample0's sum:5+5+0+5+0+5+0+5+0=25. Digital root:2+5=7. Output1. Doesn't fit.\n\nExample1's sum:8+0+8+0+8+0+8+0+8=40. Digital root:4. Output2. Doesn't fit.\n\nExample3's sum:0+1+1+0+1+1+1+0+0=5. Digital root5. Output3. No.\n\nThis isn't working.\n\nLet me think of the outputs again:1,2,2,3,3,1,6.\n\nLooking at the examples:\n\n- Examples 0 and 5 have similar structures, output1.\n\n- Examples1,2 have similar structures, output2.\n\n- Examples3,4 have similar structures, output3.\n\n- Example6 has a cross structure, output6.\n\nSo the pattern must be based on the structure's type. For example, cross gives6, X gives2, a certain other shape gives1, another gives3.\n\nBut what defines these structure types?\n\nLooking at Example3's structure:\n\nRows:\n\nRow0:0,1,1\n\nRow1:0,1,1\n\nRow2:1,0,0\n\nThis looks like the right two columns are filled in the first two rows, and the left column in the third row. So maybe three separate 'blocks' of 1s. The first two rows' right two columns form a vertical block of 2 rows. The third row's left column is a single block. So three blocks. Output3. So if the number of connected regions (blocks) is the output, then Example3's output is3. But how are the regions connected?\n\nIf adjacency includes vertical and horizontal but not diagonal:\n\nIn Example3's matrix:\n\nRow0:0,1,1\n\nRow1:0,1,1\n\nRow2:1,0,0\n\nThe 1s in row0 and row1's right two columns are connected vertically. This forms one region. The 1 in row2's left is separate. So total two regions. But output is3. So that doesn't fit.\n\nIf diagonal adjacency is allowed:\n\nRow0's (0,2) is connected to row1's (1,2). Row0's (0,1) is connected to row1's (1,1). So the right two columns form one region. The row2's (2,0) 1 is separate. So two regions. Output3. Still doesn't match.\n\nAlternatively, the number of rows with non-zero elements. In Example3, all three rows have at least one 1. Output3. That fits. Let's check other examples.\n\nExample0: all three rows have non-zero elements. Output1. Doesn't fit.\n\nExample1: all three rows have non-zero elements. Output2. Doesn't fit.\n\nExample6: all three rows have non-zero elements. Output6. Doesn't fit.\n\nNot this.\n\nAnother Idea: The output is the number of times the same number appears in the four edge positions (not including the corners). The edge positions are the middle elements of each side. For example, top edge middle, right edge middle, bottom edge middle, left edge middle. \n\nFor Example6's matrix:\n\nEdges:\n\nTop middle:5, right middle:5, bottom middle:5, left middle:5. All 5s. So four edge positions with same number. Output6. How does this relate? 4 edges + 2 corners? Not sure.\n\nThis approach is too vague.\n\nI think I'm stuck. Let me try to find a pattern that fits all examples. \n\nLooking at the test input and Example6:\n\nTest Input:\n\n[0,8,0]\n\n[8,8,8]\n\n[0,8,0]\n\nExample6's input:\n\n[0,5,0]\n\n[5,5,5]\n\n[0,5,0]\n\nThe only difference is the number used (8 vs5). So the pattern is not dependent on the number itself. \n\nThe structure is a cross (middle row and column). The output for Example6 is6. So maybe the output is6 for such a structure. \n\nSimilarly, in the test input, it's a cross structure, so output6.\n\nBut why? For example, how does the cross structure lead to output6? Maybe the cross has five non-zero elements, and 5+1=6. But why add 1?\n\nAlternatively, the cross has a certain number of lines. The cross consists of two lines (vertical and horizontal), each of length3. So 3+3=6. That's possible. So the sum of the lengths of the lines in the cross.\n\nIn Example6, the vertical line (middle column) has3 elements, the horizontal line (middle row) has3 elements. So 3+3=6. Output6. This fits. For the test input, same structure:3+3=6. Output6. This makes sense.\n\nNow check other examples:\n\nExample1's structure is an X (diagonals), which are two lines each of length3. So3+3=6. Output is2. Doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. So this idea works for cross but not for X.\n\nBut Example1's output is2. If each diagonal has3 elements, sum3+3=6. Output is2. 6 divided by3 is2. So maybe for X structures, the output is (sum of line lengths)/3. 6/3=2. For cross structures, output is sum of line lengths. 6.\n\nLet's check this.\n\nExample6's cross: sum6 \u2192 output6.\n\nExample1's X: sum6 \u2192 output6/3=2. Yes.\n\nExample0's structure: what lines are present? It's a diamond shape with a missing center. Maybe two lines forming a diamond, but each line has length2. So sum4. But output is1. 4/4=1. Not sure.\n\nExample0's output is1. If the lines are two diagonals each of length2. Sum4. 4/4=1.\n\nExample3's output is3. Maybe there are three lines. For example, the first two rows have a vertical line of length2 (right two columns), and the third row has a single element. So sum2+1=3. Output3. This fits.\n\nExample3's structure: two vertical lines (each of length2) and one horizontal line (length1). Sum2+2+1=5. No, output3.\n\nAlternatively, the number of lines. For example, three lines. Output3.\n\nThis seems plausible.\n\nLet me formalize the hypothesis:\n\nThe output is the number of lines (horizontal, vertical, or diagonal) of length >=2 in the matrix.\n\nBut let's check:\n\nExample0:\n\nPossible lines:\n\n- Row0 has two 5s: horizontal line of length2.\n\n- Row1 has 5 at the start and end: could be considered a diagonal line from (1,0) to (1,2), but that's a row of length3. Wait, row1 is [5,0,5]. So the two 5s are separated by a zero. So not a continuous line.\n\nAlternatively, vertical lines:\n\nColumn0 has two 5s in rows0 and1.\n\nColumn2 has two 5s in rows1 and2.\n\nSo two vertical lines of length2.\n\nDiagonal lines: (0,0) to (1,0) to (2,1)? Not sure.\n\nIf we count all lines of length exactly2:\n\n- Row0: two 5s (horizontal).\n\n- Column0: two 5s (vertical).\n\n- Column2: two 5s (vertical).\n\nThat's three lines. But output is1. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternative hypothesis: The output is the number of lines of maximum possible length in the matrix.\n\nFor Example6, the cross has two lines of length3 (middle row and column). So output6.\n\nExample1's X has two lines of length3 (diagonals). Output2.\n\nExample0 has lines of length2. Output1.\n\nExample3: perhaps three lines of length2.\n\nExample3's matrix:\n\n0 1 1\n\n0 1 1\n\n1 0 0\n\nPossible lines:\n\n- Row0 and row1 each have two 1s in columns1 and2: vertical lines of length2.\n\n- Column1 has two 1s in rows0 and1: vertical line of length2.\n\n- Column2 has two 1s in rows0 and1: vertical line of length2.\n\n- Row2 has a single 1: no line.\n\nSo three lines of length2. Output3.\n\nThis fits.\n\nExample5's structure is similar to Example0, which has three lines of length2. But output is1. So this hypothesis fails.\n\nThis is getting too time-consuming, and I need to provide an answer. Based on the test input's similarity to Example6, which has a cross structure leading to output6, I'll infer that the output is6."

        "cot_1": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. So, we have these input matrices and their corresponding outputs. Let me go through each example one by one and see if I can spot a pattern.\n\nStarting with Example 0:\nInput is:\n[5, 5, 0]\n[5, 0, 5]\n[0, 5, 0]\nOutput is [1]. Hmm, what's special about this matrix? Let's look for symmetry or maybe some count of certain elements. The middle row has 5,0,5. The first row is 5,5,0. The third row is 0,5,0. Maybe it's counting something like the number of symmetric elements or maybe the number of times a certain number appears in a specific pattern.\n\nExample 1:\nInput:\n[8,0,8]\n[0,8,0]\n[8,0,8]\nOutput [2]. Here, the matrix looks symmetric both vertically and horizontally. The first and third rows are the same, and each row has 8 at the ends and 0 in the middle. The middle row is 0,8,0. So maybe the output relates to the symmetry here. The output is 2 here. Comparing to example 0 which was output 1, maybe the number of axes of symmetry? Like 2 for this example (vertical and horizontal), and 1 for example 0 if it's only one axis?\n\nWait, example 0's matrix. Let's check symmetry. The first row [5,5,0], the third row [0,5,0]. If you mirror vertically, the first row would reverse to [0,5,5], which is different from the third row. But if you mirror horizontally, each row's middle element stays. Wait, maybe it's rotational symmetry. Example 0's matrix: if you rotate 180 degrees, does it look the same? Let's see. Original rows are row0:5,5,0; row1:5,0,5; row2:0,5,0. Rotated 180, row0 becomes reversed row2:0,5,0 reversed is 0,5,0. Which is row0's original is 5,5,0. So no. Hmm, maybe not symmetry. Let's think differently.\n\nLooking at example 2:\nInput is:\n[5,0,5]\n[0,5,0]\n[5,0,5]\nOutput is [2]. This matrix looks like it's symmetric both vertically and maybe diagonally. The first and third rows are the same as each other, and each row is symmetric around the center. Maybe the count here is 2 again. So examples 1 and 2 both have output 2. What do they have in common?\n\nExample 3's input:\n[0,1,1]\n[0,1,1]\n[1,0,0]\nOutput is [3]. This matrix doesn't look symmetric in an obvious way. Let's see. The first two rows are the same. The third row is [1,0,0]. Maybe looking for the number of times a certain pattern occurs. Alternatively, maybe counting the number of cells that match their mirrored positions. For example, in a 3x3 matrix, the center is position (2,2) maybe. If we check for elements that are the same when mirrored over certain axes, maybe that's the count.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the number of distinct lines of symmetry. For instance, a matrix can be symmetric over vertical, horizontal, or diagonal axes. But example 3's output is 3. That might not fit, because if it's 3 lines of symmetry, but the matrix doesn't look symmetric in three ways. Let's think of another approach.\n\nLooking at example 6's input:\n[0,5,0]\n[5,5,5]\n[0,5,0]\nOutput is [6]. This matrix looks like a cross, with the middle row all 5s and the middle column all 5s. Maybe the output here is the sum of the middle row and column? The middle row sum is 5+5+5=15, middle column is 5+5+5=15. Sum 30? But output is 6. So that's not it.\n\nAnother angle: Maybe the output is the count of certain elements when considering their positions. For example, the number of cells that are equal to the cell opposite them across the center. Let's take example 0:\n\nOriginal matrix:\n\nRow 0: [5,5,0]\nRow 1: [5,0,5]\nRow 2: [0,5,0]\n\nThe center is (1,1) which is 0. Let's check each cell and its opposite:\n\n(0,0) is 5. Opposite across center is (2,2) which is 0. Not equal. So no.\n(0,1) is 5. Opposite is (2,1) which is 5. Equal. So count 1.\n(0,2) is 0. Opposite is (2,0) which is 0. Equal. So count 2.\n(1,0) is 5. Opposite is (1,2) which is 5. Equal. Count 3.\n(1,1) is 0. Opposite is itself. So count 4?\nWait, but the output here is 1. So that approach might not be right.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's the number of times the same number appears in a cross pattern. For example, in example 6, the middle row and middle column are all 5s, forming a cross. The output is 6. The cross has 5 elements (3 in the row, 3 in the column, but overlapping at the center). So 3+3-1=5. But output is 6, which doesn't match. Hmm.\n\nWait, example 6's output is 6. Let's count the number of 5s in the matrix. The matrix is:\n\nRow0:0,5,0 \u2192 one 5.\nRow1:5,5,5 \u2192 three 5s.\nRow2:0,5,0 \u2192 one 5.\nTotal 5. But output is 6. So that's not it.\n\nWait, maybe the sum of the positions where certain conditions are met. Alternatively, maybe it's the count of the number of non-zero elements in specific positions. Let's check example 0.\n\nExample 0's matrix has:\n\nRow0:5,5,0 \u2192 two 5s.\nRow1:5,0,5 \u2192 two 5s.\nRow2:0,5,0 \u2192 one 5.\nTotal 5. But output is 1. So that's not it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is the number of rows that are palindromes. For example, in example 0:\n\nRow0:5,5,0 \u2192 reversed is 0,5,5. Not a palindrome. Row1:5,0,5 \u2192 reversed is same. So row1 is a palindrome. Row2:0,5,0 \u2192 reversed is same. So row2 is a palindrome. So total 2 palindromic rows. But output is 1. So that's not matching.\n\nWait, example 1's input is:\n\n[8,0,8]\n[0,8,0]\n[8,0,8]\n\nEach row is a palindrome. All three rows. So output is 2. But that would be 3 palindromic rows. So this approach doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the number of columns that are palindromes. For example, example 0's columns:\n\nColumn0:5,5,0 \u2192 reversed is 0,5,5. Not a palindrome.\nColumn1:5,0,5 \u2192 reversed is same (palindrome).\nColumn2:0,5,0 \u2192 reversed is same (palindrome). So two columns are palindromes. Output is 1. Doesn't match.\n\nHmm, this is getting tricky. Let's think of another approach.\n\nLooking at example 3 and 4, which both output 3. Their inputs:\n\nExample3:\n[0,1,1]\n[0,1,1]\n[1,0,0]\n\nExample4:\n[0,8,8]\n[0,8,8]\n[8,0,0]\n\nSo both have first two rows same, third row different. Maybe the output here is counting the number of unique elements in a certain way. For example, in example3, maybe there are three distinct elements? No, elements are 0,1. So two. But output is 3.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the number of times a specific pattern occurs. For example, in example3, the first two rows are [0,1,1], and the third row starts with 1 followed by two 0s. Maybe counting the number of times a particular sub-pattern occurs.\n\nWait, perhaps the output is the number of 2x2 blocks in the matrix that sum to a certain value. Let's try with example0:\n\nMatrix:\n\n5 5 0\n\n5 0 5\n\n0 5 0\n\nPossible 2x2 blocks:\n\nTop-left: 5,5;5,0 \u2192 sum 15.\n\nTop-middle:5,0;0,5 \u2192 sum 10.\n\nBottom-left:5,0;0,5 \u2192 sum 10.\n\nBottom-middle:0,5;5,0 \u2192 sum 10.\n\nNot sure. Output is 1 here. How many blocks sum to a certain number? Not sure.\n\nAnother idea: Maybe the output is the count of how many cells are equal to the sum of their neighboring cells. Let's check example0:\n\nFor cell (0,0), value 5. Neighbors are (0,1)=5, (1,0)=5. Sum 10. Not equal to 5.\n\nCell (0,1)=5. Neighbors (0,0)=5, (0,2)=0, (1,1)=0. Sum 5. So 5=5. So this counts as 1. Maybe the output counts such cells. Let's check.\n\nIn example0, how many cells are equal to the sum of their adjacent cells (including diagonally or just orthogonal?)\n\nAssuming orthogonal (up, down, left, right) neighbors:\n\nCell (0,1): neighbors left (5), right (0), down (0). Sum 5. Which equals cell value 5. So counts as 1.\n\nOther cells:\n\nCell (1,0)=5. Neighbors up (5), right (0), down (0). Sum 5. So equals 5. That's another 1. Now total 2. But output is 1. Hmm, so that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the sum of all neighbors (including diagonals). Let's check cell (0,1) in example0. Neighbors are (0,0)=5, (0,2)=0, (1,0)=5, (1,1)=0, (1,2)=5. Sum is 5+0+5+0+5=15. Value is 5. Not equal. So no.\n\nAlternative approach: Maybe the output is the number of times the same number appears in the corners. For example, example0's corners are 5,0,0,0. Only one 5. Output is 1. That fits. Let's check example1:\n\nCorners are 8,8,8,8. All 8s. So four corners. Output is 2. Doesn't fit. So no.\n\nAnother thought: Maybe the output is the number of distinct numbers present in the matrix. Example0 has 5 and 0. So two. Output is 1. Not matching. Example1 has 8 and 0. Two distinct. Output is 2. Hmm, maybe that's a possibility. Let's check other examples.\n\nExample2: numbers are 5 and 0. Output is 2. So two distinct numbers. Output is 2. That fits. Example3 has 0,1. Two distinct. Output is 3. Doesn't fit. So that's not the pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the sum of the distinct numbers. Example0: 5+0=5. Output is 1. No. Example1:8+0=8. Output 2. No.\n\nAnother angle: Looking at the position of non-zero elements. For instance, in example0:\n\nNon-zero elements are at (0,0), (0,1), (1,0), (1,2), (2,1). So 5 non-zero. Output is 1. Not matching.\n\nExample1: non-zero elements are corners and center. All 8s. How many? 8 in positions (0,0), (0,2), (1,1), (2,0), (2,2). So five 8s. Output is 2. Doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is related to the number of zeros in certain positions. Let's see. Example0: how many zeros? Let's count. Row0:1 zero. Row1:1. Row2:2. Total 4 zeros. Output is 1. Doesn't fit.\n\nHmm, this is really challenging. Let's try another approach. Let's look at the output numbers and see if there's a pattern there.\n\nExamples:\n\n0: 1\n\n1:2\n\n2:2\n\n3:3\n\n4:3\n\n5:1\n\n6:6\n\nSo the outputs are 1,2,2,3,3,1,6. Not a clear sequence. Maybe the output is the count of some specific pattern in the matrix.\n\nLooking at example6's output is 6. The matrix is:\n\n0 5 0\n\n5 5 5\n\n0 5 0\n\nIf we think of the middle row and middle column forming a cross, there are 5 elements in the cross. But output is 6. Not sure.\n\nWait, maybe the output is the sum of the middle row and middle column. Middle row in example6 is 5+5+5=15. Middle column is 5+5+5=15. Sum is 30. Output is 6. No. 30/5=6. Hmm, maybe it's (sum of middle row + sum of middle column) divided by 5. But 30/5=6. That fits. Let's check other examples.\n\nExample0: Middle row is [5,0,5] sum 10. Middle column is [5,0,5] sum 10. Sum 20. 20/5=4, but output is 1. Doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. Example1: Middle row is [0,8,0] sum 8. Middle column is [8,8,8] sum 24. Total 32. 32/5=6.4. Output is 2. Doesn't fit.\n\nAnother idea: The output might be the number of \"loops\" or enclosed areas in the digits. For example, 8 has two loops, 0 has one, etc. Let's see.\n\nExample1's matrix:\n\n8 0 8\n\n0 8 0\n\n8 0 8\n\nSo the 8s are in the corners and center. Each 8 contributes two loops. There are 5 8s. So 5*2=10. Zeros contribute one each. There are 4 zeros. 4*1=4. Total 14. But output is 2. Not matching.\n\nWait, perhaps count the number of 8s and multiply by 2, but that's 5*2=10. No. Maybe the sum of loops in the entire matrix. Example1: 5*2 +4*1=10+4=14. Output is 2. Doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the count of a specific digit's loops. But not sure.\n\nLet's think of another approach. Maybe the output is the number of times a certain pattern of numbers occurs. For example, in example0, the matrix has a sort of diagonal pattern. Let me look at the positions of non-zero elements.\n\nExample0:\n\nRow0: 5,5,0\n\nRow1:5,0,5\n\nRow2:0,5,0\n\nThe non-zero elements form a sort of diamond or X shape. The center is 0. So maybe the number of 'arms' in the X. But example0 has four arms (top, left, right, bottom), but output is 1. Not sure.\n\nWait, example1's matrix is:\n\n8 0 8\n\n0 8 0\n\n8 0 8\n\nWhich is a diamond or X shape as well, but with the center as 8. Output is 2. So maybe when the center is filled, it's a different count. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the output could be the number of times the same number appears in the four corners. For example, example0's corners are 5 (0,0), 0 (0,2), 0 (2,0), 0 (2,2). Only one 5 in the corners. Output is 1. That fits. Example1's corners are all 8s. So four 8s. Output is 2. Hmm, why 2? If it's the count of unique corners, maybe not. Wait, example1's output is 2, and all four corners are 8. So that approach doesn't fit.\n\nWait, example2's corners are 5,5,5,5. All 5s. Output is 2. So perhaps when all four corners are the same, output is 2. But example1's output is also 2. So maybe when the four corners are the same and the center is the same, output is 2. But example1's center is 8, same as corners. Example2's center is 5, same as corners. So output is 2. But example0's corners are 5,0,0,0. Only one 5, output is 1. Example5's input:\n\n[4,4,0]\n\n[4,0,4]\n\n[0,4,0]\n\nCorners are 4 (0,0),0 (0,2),0 (2,0),0 (2,2). So one 4 in corners. Output is 1. That matches. So maybe the output is the count of the most frequent corner value. For example, in example0, the corners have one 5 and three 0s. So the output is 1. That fits. Example1, four 8s, output is 2. So why 2? Hmm, this seems inconsistent.\n\nWait, perhaps the output is the number of corners that are equal to the center. For example, example0's center is 0. The corners are 5,0,0,0. Three corners equal to center (0). So output is 3. But the output is 1. So no.\n\nAnother angle: Let's look at the test input:\n\n[7,7,0]\n\n[7,0,7]\n\n[0,7,0]\n\nIf we compare this to example0 and example5. Example0's input is [5,5,0], [5,0,5], [0,5,0]. Output is 1. Similarly, example5's input is [4,4,0], [4,0,4], [0,4,0], output 1. The test input has the same structure but with 7. So the output is likely 1.\n\nBut why are these examples outputting 1? Looking at example0 and example5, their matrices have the same pattern. The first row has two of the same number followed by a 0. The second row has the same number, 0, same number. The third row starts with 0, same number, 0. So maybe this pattern corresponds to output 1. The test input follows this pattern, so the output should be [1].\n\nBut why do examples 1 and 2 have output 2? Let's check:\n\nExample1's input:\n\n[8,0,8]\n\n[0,8,0]\n\n[8,0,8]\n\nEach row is 8,0,8, then 0,8,0, then 8,0,8. This forms a diamond or X shape. Output 2.\n\nExample2's input:\n\n[5,0,5]\n\n[0,5,0]\n\n[5,0,5]\n\nSame structure as example1. Output 2. So when the matrix is symmetric with the same numbers forming an X, output is 2.\n\nExamples3 and4 have output3. Their structure:\n\nExample3:\n\n[0,1,1]\n\n[0,1,1]\n\n[1,0,0]\n\nFirst two rows are same, third row different. Output3.\n\nExample4:\n\n[0,8,8]\n\n[0,8,8]\n\n[8,0,0]\n\nSame structure as example3. Output3. So maybe when the first two rows are the same and the third row starts with a different number, output is3.\n\nExample6's input:\n\n[0,5,0]\n\n[5,5,5]\n\n[0,5,0]\n\nThis forms a cross shape. Output6. So maybe the cross has 5 elements, but output is6. Not sure. Maybe the sum of the middle row and middle column. Middle row sum 15, middle column sum 15. 15+15=30, which is 6*5. So 30/5=6. Maybe that's how. But why divide by5?\n\nWait, example6's output is6. The middle row is three 5s (sum15), middle column is three 5s (sum15). Sum total 30. If we take the sum and divide by 5, 30/5=6. That matches the output. Let's check if this works for others.\n\nExample0's middle row sum is5+0+5=10, middle column sum5+0+5=10. Total 20. 20/5=4. But output is1. Doesn't fit. So that's not it.\n\nHmm. Maybe the output is related to the sum of the entire matrix divided by some number. Example0's sum is5+5+0 +5+0+5 +0+5+0= 5+5+5+5+5=25. 25/25=1. Output is1. That fits. Let's check others.\n\nExample1's sum is8+0+8 +0+8+0 +8+0+8=8*5=40. 40/20=2. Output is2. Wait, 40 divided by what gives 2? 20. Hmm, example1's output is2. So 40/20=2. But why 20? Maybe sum of the non-zero elements. Example1 has 5 eights. 5*8=40. 40/ (8*2.5) = 2. Not sure.\n\nExample2's sum is5*5=25. 25/25=1. Output is2. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAnother idea: The output is the number of times the number appears in the matrix divided by some factor. Example0 has 5 appearing 5 times. 5/5=1. Output is1. Example1 has 5 eights. 5/ something=2. 5/2.5=2. Not clear.\n\nAlternatively, the output is the number of unique diagonal elements. For example, example0's main diagonal is5,0,0. Other diagonal is0,0,0. So two unique sets. Output is1. Doesn't fit.\n\nThis is really tricky. Let's try to find another pattern.\n\nLooking at the positions of non-zero elements:\n\nExample0:\n\nRow0: [5,5,0]\n\nRow1: [5,0,5]\n\nRow2: [0,5,0]\n\nThe non-zero positions form a kind of 'V' shape. Maybe the output is the number of peaks or something. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is the number of islands or connected regions of non-zero elements. Example0's non-zero elements are connected in a way that forms a single connected region. So output1. Example1 has non-zero elements in an X shape, which is two separate regions (if the center is considered a connection). Wait, no. An X connects all the arms through the center. So it's one connected region. Output is2. Hmm, not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the number of times the number appears in the outer ring of the matrix. For example, example0's outer ring (first and third rows, first and third columns) has 5s and 0s. Count the number of 5s. Let's see:\n\nRow0:5,5,0 \u2192 two 5s.\n\nRow2:0,5,0 \u2192 one 5.\n\nColumns: first column has 5,5,0 \u2192 two 5s; third column has 0,5,0 \u2192 one 5. But overlapping with rows. Total outer elements are 8 (since 3x3 outer ring has 8 elements). In example0, the outer ring has 5,5,0 (row0), 5 (row1 first), 5 (row1 third), 0,5,0 (row2). Let's count:\n\nRow0:5,5,0 \u2192 two 5s.\n\nRow2:0,5,0 \u2192 one 5.\n\nColumn first: row0, row1, row2 \u2192 5,5,0. Two 5s.\n\nColumn third: row0, row1, row2 \u21920,5,0. One 5.\n\nBut we have overlaps. For example, the corners are counted in both rows and columns.\n\nTotal 5s in outer ring: (5,0,0) \u2192 (0,0)=5, (0,1)=5, (0,2)=0; (1,0)=5, (1,2)=5; (2,0)=0, (2,1)=5, (2,2)=0. So total 5s: (0,0), (0,1), (1,0), (1,2), (2,1). That's five 5s. Output is1. Doesn't fit.\n\nThis is getting frustrating. Let's think again.\n\nAnother approach: Let's look for the output as the count of the number of times the same number appears in a certain pattern. For example, in example6, the output is6. The matrix has 5s arranged in a cross (middle row and middle column). The cross has 5 elements (3 in row, 3 in column, but center counted once). So 5 elements. Output is6. Doesn't fit.\n\nWait, example6's matrix:\n\n0 5 0\n\n5 5 5\n\n0 5 0\n\nSum of all elements: 0+5+0 +5+5+5 +0+5+0=25. 25/5=5. Output is6. Not matching.\n\nAlternative idea: The output is the number of cells that are equal to the sum of their row and column indices. For example, row0 column0:0+0=0. Value is5. Not equal. So that's not.\n\nHmm. Let's look at the test input:\n\nTest Input:\n\n[7,7,0]\n\n[7,0,7]\n\n[0,7,0]\n\nComparing to example0 and example5, which have the same pattern and output1. The test input has the same structure but with 7s. So following that pattern, the output should be [1].",

        "cot_2": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. So, we have these input matrices and corresponding outputs. Let's look at each example and see what's going on.\n\nStarting with Example 0:\nInput is:\n[5,5,0]\n[5,0,5]\n[0,5,0]\nOutput is [1]. Hmm. Maybe looking at the structure of the matrix. The first row starts with two 5s and a 0. The second row alternates 5,0,5. The third row has 0,5,0. Wait, maybe it's about symmetry or some kind of shape. Like, maybe the 5s form a particular figure. The output here is 1. Let's see other examples.\n\nExample 1:\nInput:\n[8,0,8]\n[0,8,0]\n[8,0,8]\nOutput [2]. This matrix looks like a diamond shape made of 8s. The output is 2. Maybe the number of loops or enclosed areas in the digits? Wait, 8 has two loops. But then in Example 0, the output is 1. The digits there are 5s, which maybe have one enclosed area. Wait, maybe the output is the sum of the number of enclosed areas in each digit present.\n\nWait, but let's check. In Example 0, the input has 5s and 0s. The 5 has no enclosed areas, right? Wait, 0 has one enclosed area, 8 has two. But in Example 0, maybe the 5s are forming a pattern where the count of certain things is 1. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the number of times a certain pattern appears in the matrix.\n\nWait, looking at Example 6:\nInput:\n[0,5,0]\n[5,5,5]\n[0,5,0]\nOutput is [6]. The matrix here forms a cross shape, maybe. The output is 6. But how does that relate? The digits are 5 and 0. If 5 has no enclosed areas and 0 has one, but the output is 6, that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the sum of the digits in a particular arrangement. Let's check:\n\nExample 0's sum: 5+5+0 +5+0+5 +0+5+0 = 5+5+5+5+5=25. Output is 1. That doesn't seem to align.\n\nAnother approach: maybe the output is the count of a specific pattern in the matrix. For instance, the number of \"rings\" or circular structures formed by the non-zero numbers. Let's look at Example 0's matrix:\n\nRow 0: 5,5,0\nRow 1:5,0,5\nRow 2:0,5,0\n\nIf we visualize this, the non-zero elements form a sort of diamond shape? Like, the center is 0, and the surrounding cells are 5s. Wait, but the first row has two 5s, the second has 5 at the ends and 0 in the middle. The third row has a 5 in the middle. Wait, maybe it's the number of concentric squares or layers. Or maybe the number of times a certain path is formed.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the arrangement of non-zero elements. For example 0, the matrix looks like this (non-zero positions marked as X):\n\nX X 0\nX 0 X\n0 X 0\n\nThis forms a sort of cross or maybe a V-shape. But how does that lead to output 1?\n\nWait, let's check Example 1's input:\n\nRow 0:8,0,8\nRow1:0,8,0\nRow2:8,0,8\n\nNon-zero positions are:\n\nX 0 X\n0 X 0\nX 0 X\n\nThis forms a diamond pattern. Output is 2. So maybe the number of concentric diamonds or layers. But the output here is 2, maybe because there are two layers? Wait, in this case, the diamond is a single layer, but the 8s form a single diamond. So maybe not. Alternatively, the digit 8 has two loops, so perhaps the output is the sum of the loops in the digits. So in Example 1, there are four 8s and a 0. Each 8 contributes 2, so 4*2=8, plus 0 contributes 1 each? But the output is 2. That doesn't add up.\n\nAnother angle: look at the positions of the non-zero elements. Maybe the output is the number of times a certain configuration occurs. For example, in Example 0, the non-zero elements form a cross (like a plus sign) but not a full cross. Let's count the non-zero elements. Example 0 has 5 non-zero elements (positions (0,0), (0,1), (1,0), (1,2), (2,1)). But the output is 1. So maybe not the count of elements.\n\nAlternatively, the pattern could be related to the number of \"holes\" in the entire matrix when considering non-zero digits. Holes here might refer to enclosed areas. For example, in Example 0, the arrangement of 5s might form a single enclosed area. Let's see:\n\nThe matrix in Example 0:\n\n5 5 0\n\n5 0 5\n\n0 5 0\n\nIf we imagine this as a grid, the 5s form a sort of 'H' shape maybe. But does that enclose any holes? Hmm. Maybe not. Alternatively, maybe it's the number of times a certain pattern repeats. Like, the number of times a diamond shape is formed. But Example 1 has a diamond and outputs 2. Wait, maybe the output is the sum of the digits in the central position. For Example 0, the center (1,1) is 0. That doesn't help.\n\nWait, looking at Example 6's output being 6. The input is:\n\n[0,5,0]\n\n[5,5,5]\n\n[0,5,0]\n\nThe non-zero elements form a cross (plus sign) shape. The output is 6. How does that relate? The sum of the digits? All are 5s except the center. Wait, sum is 0+5+0 +5+5+5 +0+5+0 = 5+5+5+5+5=25. No, output is 6. Maybe the count of non-zero elements? There are 5 elements here (middle row has three 5s, and top and bottom have one each). But output is 6, which doesn't match.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is the number of corners occupied by non-zero elements. For example, in Example 0, the corners are positions (0,0), (0,2), (2,0), (2,2). In Example 0's input, (0,0)=5, (0,2)=0, (2,0)=0, (2,2)=0. So only one corner is non-zero. Output is 1. That matches. Let's check other examples.\n\nExample 1:\n\nCorners are (0,0)=8, (0,2)=8, (2,0)=8, (2,2)=8. All four corners are non-zero. Output is 2. Hmm, that doesn't match. So four corners but output 2. So that theory is invalid.\n\nAnother idea: the number of edges (rows or columns) that have non-zero elements. For Example 0, all three rows and columns have at least one non-zero. So three edges? Output is 1. Doesn't match.\n\nAlternatively, the output is the number of distinct rows or columns that match a certain pattern. For example, in Example 0, the rows are [5,5,0], [5,0,5], [0,5,0]. The first and third rows are different, but maybe looking for symmetry. Let's see.\n\nLooking for vertical or horizontal symmetry. Example 0's matrix: if we check for vertical symmetry (mirror along the middle column), first row [5,5,0] becomes [0,5,5], which isn't the same. So not symmetric. Maybe not.\n\nAnother angle: the output could be the count of a certain digit in the matrix, but the examples don't support that. For example, in Example 0, there are five 5s and output 1. Example 1 has four 8s and output 2. So no.\n\nWait, let's check the examples again more carefully.\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput:\n[0,1,1]\n[0,1,1]\n[1,0,0]\n\nOutput is [3]. Let's see the matrix. The non-zero elements here form a sort of L-shape maybe. The first two rows have 0s in the first column, then 1s. The third row starts with 1 and then 0s. Maybe the number of right angles or corners formed by the 1s. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the number of times the pattern alternates in a certain way. For example, in Example 3, the first two rows have 0 in the first position and 1s in the next two. The third row has 1 followed by 0s. So maybe three distinct patterns here. But output is 3. That might align.\n\nAlternatively, think of the matrix as a binary grid (non-zero as 1, zero as 0). Then, perhaps the output is the number of connected regions of non-zeros. But for Example 0, the non-zeros form a connected region. But output is 1. That would make sense if it's the number of connected regions. But let's check other examples.\n\nExample 3's binary matrix:\n\n0 1 1\n\n0 1 1\n\n1 0 0\n\nThe non-zero regions: the top-right 2x2 block and the bottom-left cell. So two connected regions. But the output is 3. So that doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. Maybe the pattern is about the sum of the digits in specific positions. Let's see:\n\nExample 0: The sum of the four corners? (5 + 0 + 0 + 0) =5. Output 1. Not sure.\n\nExample 1: 8 +8 +8 +8=32. Output 2. No relation.\n\nAnother approach: Looking for the number of times a certain digit appears in the middle of a cross. For example, in Example 6, the middle element is 5 (second row, second column). The cross around it (up, down, left, right) are also 5s. So it's a plus sign. The output is 6. Not sure how 6 comes from that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the number of \"branches\" in the figure formed by non-zero elements. For example, in Example 6, the cross has four branches (up, down, left, right), but the output is 6. Doesn't fit.\n\nWait, perhaps the output is the number of intersections in the matrix. For instance, in a cross shape, the center is one intersection. But in Example 6, output is 6. So that doesn't help.\n\nAlternatively, think of the digits as representing something else. For example, maybe the sum of all the digits modulo some number. But Example 0's sum is 5*5=25 (since there are five 5s), which modulo 24 gives 1. But 25 mod 24 is 1. Output is 1. That could be a possibility. Let's check Example 1: four 8s sum to 32. 32 mod 24 is 8. But output is 2. Doesn't fit.\n\nWait, but Example 0's sum is 5*5 (five 5s?), no, wait, Example 0 has five 5s: rows [5,5,0], [5,0,5], [0,5,0]. So 5+5+5+5+5 =25. 25 mod 24=1. Output is 1. That matches. Example 1 has four 8s: 8*4=32. 32 mod 24=8. Output is 2. Doesn't match. So that's not it.\n\nAlternatively, sum divided by 10. 25/10=2.5, no. Example 1: 32/10=3.2. Output is 2. Not matching.\n\nAnother thought: the output could be the number of times the digit '0' appears in the matrix. Example 0 has 4 zeros. Output 1. Doesn't fit.\n\nWait, let's think differently. The examples have outputs [1], [2], [2], [3], [3], [1], [6]. Looking for a pattern here, maybe the output is the number of layers or rings in the matrix. For example, in Example 0, the non-zero elements form a single ring or layer. Example 1's matrix forms a diamond, maybe two layers? Or perhaps the output is the count of certain symmetrical properties.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the number of diagonal lines of non-zero elements. For Example 0, the main diagonals: (0,0), (1,1), (2,2) are 5,0,0. The other diagonal (0,2), (1,1), (2,0) are 0,0,0. So no diagonals. Output is 1. Not sure.\n\nWait, let's look at Example 6 again. The matrix is:\n\n0 5 0\n\n5 5 5\n\n0 5 0\n\nThis forms a vertical and horizontal line through the center. The output is 6. If the cross has two lines (vertical and horizontal), maybe the sum is 2, but output is 6. Not matching.\n\nHmm. Let's try to find another angle. Looking at the digits in the input and their relation to the output. For example, in Example 0, the digits are all 5 and 0. The output is 1. In Example 1, digits are 8 and 0. Output is 2. Example 2 is similar to Example 1 but with 5s. Output is 2. Example 3 uses 1s and 0s, output 3. Example 4 uses 8s and 0s, output 3. Example 5 uses 4s and 0s, output 1. Example 6 uses 5s and 0s, output 6.\n\nWait, maybe the output is the sum of the digits in the non-zero elements divided by the digit itself. For example, Example 0: sum is 5*5=25. 25 /5 =5. Output is 1. Doesn't fit. Example 1: sum is 8*4=32. 32/8=4. Output is 2. No. Example 3: sum is 1*5=5. 5/1=5. Output is 3. Not matching. Example 6: sum is 5*5=25. 25/5=5. Output is 6. Doesn't fit.\n\nAlternative approach: looking for the number of times the digit in the output appears in the matrix. For example, if output is [1], maybe the digit 1 appears once. But in Example 0, there are no 1s, output is 1. So that's not it.\n\nWait, another idea. The output might be the number of distinct 2x2 squares in the matrix that have a certain property. For example, a 2x2 square with all non-zero elements. Let's check Example 1:\n\nOriginal matrix:\n\n8,0,8\n\n0,8,0\n\n8,0,8\n\nPossible 2x2 squares:\n\nTop-left: 8,0;0,8 \u2192 has three non-zero (8,8,8). But not all. So no. Similarly, others. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the number of 2x2 squares with exactly two non-zero elements. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the count of the digits in the matrix that have a certain number of enclosed areas. For instance:\n\n0 has 1 enclosed area.\n\n1 has 0.\n\n2 has 0.\n\n3 has 0.\n\n4 has 0 or 1 depending on the font.\n\n5 has 0.\n\n6 has 1.\n\n7 has 0.\n\n8 has 2.\n\n9 has 1.\n\nBut this depends on how the digits are written. Assuming standard digital display:\n\n0:1, 1:0, 2:0, 3:0, 4:0, 5:0, 6:1, 7:0, 8:2, 9:1.\n\nSo, for each example:\n\nExample 0: 5s and 0s. The 0s contribute 1 each. The matrix has four 0s and five 5s. Total enclosed areas: 4*1 +5*0=4. Output is 1. Doesn't match.\n\nExample 1: 8s and 0s. Four 8s (each 2), and five 0s (each 1). So 4*2 +5*1=8+5=13. Output is 2. No match.\n\nExample 3: 1s and 0s. Five 1s (0), four 0s (1). So 0*5 +1*4=4. Output is 3. No.\n\nExample 6: 5s and 0s. Five 5s (0) and four 0s (1). Sum is 4. Output is 6. Doesn't fit.\n\nHmm, but in Example 6's output is 6, which is the number of enclosed areas if there's a 6 in the matrix. But the matrix in Example 6 has 5s and 0s. Wait, maybe the sum of enclosed areas of all digits plus something else. Not sure.\n\nAnother angle: maybe the output is the number of times the pattern of the matrix forms a numeric digit. For example, the matrix in Example 6 forms a cross which resembles the digit 5, but the output is 6. Not sure.\n\nWait, looking at Example 6's output being 6. Maybe the matrix itself forms the shape of the number 6 when viewed as a 3x3 grid. Let's imagine:\n\n0 5 0 \u2192 row 0: middle is 5, others 0.\n\n5 5 5 \u2192 row 1: all 5s.\n\n0 5 0 \u2192 row 2: middle is 5.\n\nThis forms a vertical line in the middle and the middle row as horizontal. So it's a cross. But the number 6 is written differently. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the sum of the digits in the middle row. In Example 6, middle row is [5,5,5], sum 15. Output is 6. 1+5=6. That's a possibility. Let's check other examples.\n\nExample 0's middle row is [5,0,5], sum 10. 1+0=1, which matches output [1].\n\nExample 1's middle row is [0,8,0], sum 8. Output is 2. 8 mod 8 is 0, but output is 2. Doesn't fit. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe the sum of the middle row digits. Example 0: 5+0+5=10. 1+0=1. Output 1. Example 1: 0+8+0=8. Output 2. 8 divided by 4 is 2? Not sure. Example 6: 5+5+5=15. 1+5=6. Output 6. That works for these cases.\n\nCheck Example 3: middle row [0,1,1], sum 2. Output 3. Doesn't fit. So this theory works for some examples but not all.\n\nAnother thought: maybe the output is the count of non-zero elements in the middle column. Example 0's middle column is [5,0,5], so two non-zero. Output 1. Doesn't match. Example 1's middle column [0,8,0], one non-zero. Output 2. No. Example 6's middle column [5,5,5], three non-zero. Output 6. Doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, the sum of the middle column. Example 0: 5+0+5=10. Output 1. 10 mod 9=1. Example 1: 0+8+0=8. 8 mod 6=2. Output 2. Example 6: 5+5+5=15. 15 mod 9=6. Output 6. That seems to fit for these three examples. Let's check others.\n\nExample 2: Input is:\n\n[5,0,5]\n\n[0,5,0]\n\n[5,0,5]\n\nMiddle column: 0,5,0 \u2192 sum 5. 5 mod 9=5. Output is 2. Doesn't fit.\n\nExample 3: Middle column [1,1,0] sum 2. Output 3. 2 mod 9=2. Not matching.\n\nHmm. So maybe this only works for some examples. Not sure.\n\nAnother idea: the output is the count of non-zero elements in the middle row. Example 0's middle row has two non-zero (5 and 5). Output 1. No. Example 1's middle row has one non-zero (8). Output 2. No. Example 6's middle row has three non-zero. Output 6. Doesn't fit.\n\nThis is getting tricky. Let's try to look for another pattern.\n\nLooking at the Test Input:\n\n[7,7,0]\n\n[7,0,7]\n\n[0,7,0]\n\nIf we follow the same pattern as Example 0 and Example 5, which output [1], here the matrix is similar to Example 0 but with 7s. So the output might be [1], but let's confirm.\n\nExample 0 and 5 have similar structures. Let's see:\n\nExample 0:\n\nRow0: 5,5,0\n\nRow1:5,0,5\n\nRow2:0,5,0\n\nOutput:1\n\nExample 5:\n\nRow0:4,4,0\n\nRow1:4,0,4\n\nRow2:0,4,0\n\nOutput:1\n\nSo the structure is the same, with two non-zero in first row, two in the second, one in the third. So the output is 1. The digit itself (5 or 4) doesn't matter. So the pattern might be that when the matrix has this specific arrangement (the positions of non-zero elements), the output is 1. So the test input has the same structure but with 7s, so output should be [1].\n\nBut wait, looking at other examples:\n\nExample 1,2: They have a different structure (diamond pattern) and output 2. So maybe the output is determined by the arrangement of non-zero elements. For example:\n\n- If the non-zero elements form a cross (like Example 0,5), output is 1.\n\n- If they form a diamond (Examples 1,2), output is 2.\n\n- If they form an L-shape or something else (Examples3,4), output is3.\n\n- Example6's structure is a cross with a full middle row. Output is6.\n\nSo maybe the output is determined by the shape formed by the non-zero elements. Let's categorize:\n\nExample0 and 5: cross shape (but not a full cross). Output 1.\n\nExamples1 and2: diamond shape. Output 2.\n\nExamples3 and4: L-shape or two rows of two followed by a single in the third. Output3.\n\nExample6: full vertical and horizontal middle line, forming a plus sign. Output6.\n\nSo, for the test input:\n\nRow0:7,7,0\n\nRow1:7,0,7\n\nRow2:0,7,0\n\nThis is the same structure as Example0 and5 (cross shape), so output should be1.\n\nBut wait, what about Example6? Its structure is:\n\nRow0:0,5,0\n\nRow1:5,5,5\n\nRow2:0,5,0\n\nWhich forms a plus sign. Output is6. So the shape here is different. The cross in Example6 has the middle row all non-zero, and middle column has three non-zero (middle row and middle of other rows). So maybe the output for a plus sign is6.\n\nSo the pattern seems to be based on the shape formed by the non-zero elements:\n\n- Cross shape (like Example0,5, test input): output1.\n\n- Diamond shape (Examples1,2): output2.\n\n- L-shape (Examples3,4): output3.\n\n- Plus sign (Example6): output6.\n\nThus, the test input's structure matches Example0 and5, which output1. So the answer should be [1]."

        "cot_1": "Okay, let's tackle this puzzle. So, the task is to figure out the pattern that maps the given input matrices to their corresponding outputs. Let's look at the training examples and see if I can spot a pattern.\n\nStarting with Example 0:\nInput:\n[5,5,0]\n[5,0,5]\n[0,5,0]\nOutput: [1]\n\nHmm. Maybe the numbers form some kind of shape or symmetry. Let's check the arrangement. The first row has 5,5,0. The second is 5,0,5. Third is 0,5,0. If I visualize this, maybe it's forming a cross or some pattern. The middle element of each row is 5,0,5? Wait, second row is 5,0,5. So maybe it's a diagonal cross? Not sure. The output is 1 here.\n\nExample 1:\nInput:\n[8,0,8]\n[0,8,0]\n[8,0,8]\nOutput: [2]\n\nThis matrix looks symmetric. The first and third rows are the same (8,0,8), and the middle row is 0,8,0. It might form an 'X' shape. Output is 2. Maybe the number of distinct elements or the count of something in the pattern?\n\nExample 2:\nInput:\n[5,0,5]\n[0,5,0]\n[5,0,5]\nOutput: [2]\n\nThis is similar to Example 1 but with 5s. So same structure as Example 1. Output is 2 here too. So perhaps when the matrix forms an 'X' pattern (like the two diagonals filled), the output is 2. But Example 0's output was 1. Let's check Example 0 again. The first row is 5,5,0. Second row 5,0,5. Third row 0,5,0. Maybe it's a different pattern. Maybe the number of lines (like rows, columns, diagonals) that sum to a certain value?\n\nLooking at Example 3:\nInput:\n[0,1,1]\n[0,1,1]\n[1,0,0]\nOutput: [3]\n\nThis one's a bit different. The first two rows are the same, and the third is different. Maybe vertical or horizontal lines. Let's check the sums. The first two columns of the first two rows are 0,0 and 1,1. The third column has 1,1,0. Not sure. Output is 3.\n\nExample 4:\nInput:\n[0,8,8]\n[0,8,8]\n[8,0,0]\nOutput: [3]\n\nThis looks similar to Example 3 but with 8s. The structure is the same: first two rows have 0,8,8, third row starts with 8. So maybe the count here is based on some grouping or repetition. Both Example 3 and 4 output 3.\n\nExample 5:\nInput:\n[4,4,0]\n[4,0,4]\n[0,4,0]\nOutput: [1]\n\nThis looks similar to Example 0. The structure is the same but with 4s. Output is 1. So maybe the pattern in Examples 0 and 5 is the same, leading to output 1.\n\nExample 6:\nInput:\n[0,5,0]\n[5,5,5]\n[0,5,0]\nOutput: [6]\n\nHere, the middle row is all 5s, and the first and third rows have 0,5,0. This looks like a vertical line down the middle column. So perhaps when there's a vertical line, the output is 6. Or maybe the sum of the middle column? Let's check: middle column in example 6 is 5,5,5. Sum is 15, but output is 6. Not sure.\n\nTrying to find a common theme. Let's list out all outputs and possible patterns:\n\n- Output 1: Examples 0 and 5. Their matrices have a certain pattern. Let's compare them:\n\nExample 0:\nRow0: 5,5,0\nRow1:5,0,5\nRow2:0,5,0\n\nLooking at the positions, maybe the non-zero elements form a 'T' shape. The first row has two 5s, then the middle of the second row. Alternatively, maybe it's a cross that's not diagonal. Or the sum of certain elements. Let's calculate sums:\n\nRow sums for Example 0:\n10 (5+5+0), 10 (5+0+5), 5 (0+5+0). Column sums: 10, 10,5. Diagonal sums: 5 (5+0+0) and 0 (0+0+0). Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the number of times a certain pattern occurs. Like, the number of lines (rows, columns, diagonals) that have all elements non-zero. For Example 0, the rows: first row has two 5s and a 0. Not all non-zero. Second row has two 5s and a 0. Third row has one 5. So maybe not that.\n\nAnother idea: the count of the number of elements that are equal to the maximum element in the matrix. Let's check.\n\nIn Example 0: All elements are 5 except some zeros. Max is 5. How many 5s? Let's count:\n\nRow0: two 5s, row1: two 5s, row2: one 5. Total 5. But output is 1. Hmm, not matching.\n\nWait, maybe the output is the number of distinct lines (rows, columns, diagonals) that have elements in a certain pattern. For example, in Example 0, maybe the rows and columns that alternate non-zero and zero.\n\nAlternative approach: Look for the output number and see if it relates to the structure. For example, output 1 for Examples 0 and 5. Let's see their structures:\n\nExample 0:\n5 5 0\n5 0 5\n0 5 0\n\nIf I look at this, the non-zero elements form a sort of diamond shape. The center is 0. Then, the positions are (0,0), (0,1), (1,0), (1,2), (2,1). Maybe the number of such positions? But that's 5 positions. Output is 1. Not matching.\n\nWait, maybe the output is the number of 'islands' or connected regions of non-zero elements. Let's see:\n\nIn Example 0, the non-zero elements are arranged such that they form a cross-like shape. Are they all connected? Let's see:\n\nThe 5s are at (0,0), (0,1), (1,0), (1,2), (2,1). These are connected diagonally. For instance, (0,0) is adjacent to (0,1) and (1,0). (1,0) is adjacent to (2,1) via diagonal? Or maybe adjacency is considered only horizontal and vertical. If adjacency is only horizontal/vertical, then (0,0) is connected to (0,1) and (1,0). (1,0) is connected to (2,1) via (1,0) \u2192 (1,1) is 0, so no. So maybe the connected regions are separated. Wait, maybe the non-zero elements form a single connected region if diagonal adjacency is allowed. For example, (0,1) is adjacent to (1,0) diagonally. If diagonal counts, then maybe all 5s are connected. So one connected region. Then output is 1. That fits.\n\nIn Example 1:\n\n8 0 8\n0 8 0\n8 0 8\n\nThe non-zero elements here are in positions (0,0), (0,2), (1,1), (2,0), (2,2). If we consider diagonal adjacency, then (0,0) is connected to (1,1) and (2,0). (0,2) is connected to (1,1) and (2,2). (2,0) connects to (1,1), and (2,2) connects to (1,1). So all non-zero elements form a single connected region. But output is 2. So this contradicts the previous idea. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the number of times a certain pattern repeats. Let's look at another angle. The output numbers: 1,2,2,3,3,1,6.\n\nLooking at Example 6's output is 6. The matrix is:\n\n0 5 0\n5 5 5\n0 5 0\n\nThe non-zero elements here form a cross in the middle row and column. So maybe the sum of the middle row and middle column? Middle row sum is 15, middle column sum is 5+5+5=15. 15 +15=30. But output is 6. Doesn't fit.\n\nAlternative idea: The output is the number of times a certain number appears. For example, in Example 0, the number 5 appears 5 times, but output is 1. Not matching.\n\nWait, maybe the output is the number of rows that have a certain sum. For example, in Example 0, the row sums are 10, 10, 5. Columns sums: 10, 10, 5. Diagonals: 5+0+0=5, 0+0+0=0. So, how many lines (rows, columns, diagonals) sum to 10? Two rows and two columns sum to 10. But output is 1. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAnother approach: Let's see the outputs. Example 0:1, 1:2, 2:2, 3:3, 4:3, 5:1, 6:6.\n\nLooking for possible relations. Maybe the output is the number of symmetrical axes the matrix has. For example:\n\nExample 1's matrix is:\n\n8 0 8\n0 8 0\n8 0 8\n\nThis is symmetric along both the main diagonal and the vertical center line. Wait, let's check:\n\nOriginal matrix rows: row0 is [8,0,8], row1 [0,8,0], row2 [8,0,8].\n\nIf you flip vertically, the rows remain the same. So vertical symmetry. Also, flipping horizontally (mirroring columns), the columns are same. So vertical and horizontal symmetry. But maybe diagonal symmetry. For example, transpose of the matrix would be same as original. Let's see:\n\nTransposed matrix would be:\n\n8 0 8\n\n0 8 0\n\n8 0 8\n\nWhich is same as original. So it's symmetric along the main diagonal. So possible axes of symmetry: vertical, horizontal, main diagonal, and anti-diagonal? Wait, let's check:\n\nOriginal matrix:\n\nRow 0:8,0,8\n\nRow 1:0,8,0\n\nRow 2:8,0,8\n\nIf you reflect over the vertical axis (middle column), each row becomes reversed. For row0: 8,0,8 \u2192 reversed same. Row1:0,8,0 \u2192 same. Row2 same. So vertical symmetry.\n\nIf you reflect over the horizontal axis (middle row), rows 0 and 2 are the same. So horizontal symmetry.\n\nIf you reflect over the main diagonal (swap rows and columns), since the matrix is symmetric, yes. So that's another axis.\n\nSimilarly, reflecting over the anti-diagonal (swap row i with column 2-i), let's see:\n\nOriginal rows:\n\nRow0: 8 0 8\n\nRow1:0 8 0\n\nRow2:8 0 8\n\nAfter anti-diagonal reflection:\n\nFirst row becomes column 2: 8,0,8 \u2192 same as original row0.\n\nSecond row becomes column 1:0,8,0 \u2192 same as original row1.\n\nThird row becomes column 0:8,0,8 \u2192 same as original row0.\n\nSo the matrix is symmetric along anti-diagonal as well.\n\nSo Example1's matrix has 4 axes of symmetry. But output is 2. So that doesn't align.\n\nAlternative thought: Maybe the output is the number of 2x2 submatrices that sum to a certain value. Let's see.\n\nIn Example0:\n\nThe matrix is:\n\n5 5 0\n\n5 0 5\n\n0 5 0\n\nPossible 2x2 submatrices:\n\nTop-left: 5,5;5,0 \u2192 sum 15.\n\nTop-middle:5,0;0,5 \u2192 sum 10.\n\nMiddle-left:5,0;0,5 \u2192 sum 10.\n\nMiddle-middle:0,5;5,0 \u2192 sum 10.\n\nBottom-left:0,5;5,0 \u2192 sum 10.\n\nBut not sure how this relates to output 1.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the number of distinct elements. In Example0, elements are 5 and 0. So 2 distinct elements. Output is 1. Doesn't match.\n\nAnother idea: The output is the number of times a certain digit appears in the entire matrix. For example, Example0 has five 5s and four 0s. Output is 1. Doesn't fit.\n\nWait, let's look at the test input:\n\nTest Input:\n\n[2,0,2]\n\n[0,2,0]\n\n[2,0,2]\n\nThis is similar to Example1 and Example2. The pattern here is the same as those examples, which had outputs 2. So perhaps the test input's output is 2. But wait, in Example1 and Example2, the output was 2. So maybe for matrices that form an 'X' pattern (non-zero elements on both diagonals), the output is 2. Let's check:\n\nTest input matrix:\n\nRow0:2,0,2\n\nRow1:0,2,0\n\nRow2:2,0,2\n\nThe non-zero elements are on the two diagonals and the middle. So similar to Examples1 and 2. So output should be 2. But let's verify with other examples.\n\nExample3:\n\nInput:\n\n0,1,1\n\n0,1,1\n\n1,0,0\n\nThis has a different pattern. The first two rows have two 1s, third row starts with 1. Maybe three distinct regions? Let's see connected regions. If adjacency is vertical/horizontal, the first two rows have two 1s each in columns 1 and 2. They form a 2x2 square on the top right. The third row has a single 1 in column 0. So two separate regions. But output is 3. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe the output counts the number of corners that have non-zero elements. Let's check:\n\nFor Example3, the corners are (0,0)=0, (0,2)=1, (2,0)=1, (2,2)=0. So two corners are non-zero. Output is 3. Doesn't match.\n\nAnother angle: The output could be the number of rows that have the same elements. For example, in Example3, the first two rows are [0,1,1], so two rows same. The third row is different. So two rows same. Output is 3. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the count of some specific arrangement. Let's think of each example's output:\n\nExample0:1, Example1:2, Example2:2, Example3:3, Example4:3, Example5:1, Example6:6.\n\nLooking for possible patterns here. For instance, the outputs 1,2,2,3,3,1,6. Could these numbers relate to the number of times the pattern of the matrix appears when rotated or mirrored?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the number of intersections or crossings in the matrix. For example, in Example0, maybe there's one crossing point where lines meet. Not sure.\n\nWait, looking at Example6's output of 6. The matrix is:\n\n0,5,0\n\n5,5,5\n\n0,5,0\n\nThis forms a cross in the middle row and middle column. So the cross has 5 elements. But the output is 6. Maybe the sum of the middle row and middle column? Middle row sum is 15, middle column sum is 5+5+5=15. 15+15=30. Not 6. Alternatively, the product: 15*15=225. No. Or the count of elements in the cross: 3 (row) +3 (column) -1 (overlap) =5. Still not 6.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the count of certain cell positions. For example, the number of cells that are non-zero and have even coordinates. Not sure.\n\nWait, Example6's output is 6. Let me count the number of 5s in that matrix. There are five 5s. No. Output is 6. Doesn't match.\n\nAnother angle: Let's think of the matrix as a 3x3 grid, and look for how many times the number in the middle (position [1][1]) appears. In Example6, the middle is 5. The output is 6. How? 5 is not 6. Example1's middle is 8, output is2. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps the output is the sum of the middle row and middle column. For Example6:\n\nMiddle row sum:5+5+5=15. Middle column sum:5+5+5=15. Total 30. But 30 is not 6.\n\nAlternatively, the count of non-zero elements in the middle row and column. Middle row in Example6 has 3 non-zero. Middle column has 3. Total 6. Ah! That fits. So output would be 3+3=6. Which matches Example6's output of 6.\n\nLet's check other examples with this hypothesis.\n\nExample0:\n\nMiddle row is [5,0,5]. Non-zero count: 2.\n\nMiddle column is [5,0,5]. Non-zero count:2. Sum is 4. But output is1. Doesn't fit. So this idea is wrong.\n\nNext idea: Maybe the output is the number of non-zero elements in the matrix divided by something. For Example6, 5 non-zero elements. Output is6. 5/6 is not relevant.\n\nAlternative approach: Let's look for a pattern where the output corresponds to the number of distinct diagonal crosses. Wait, in Example1, the matrix has an X shape (both diagonals). Output is2. Example2 also X shape, output2. Test input is X shape, so output2. That seems plausible. But why Example0's output is1. Example0's matrix isn't an X. Let's see:\n\nExample0's matrix:\n\n5,5,0\n\n5,0,5\n\n0,5,0\n\nThis doesn't form a perfect X. The diagonals are 5,0,0 and 0,0,0. So the main diagonal (top-left to bottom-right) is 5,0,0. The anti-diagonal (top-right to bottom-left) is0,0,0. So the X is not present here. Instead, maybe it's another pattern.\n\nSo perhaps the output is the number of diagonal crosses (X) present. So in Example1 and 2, there are two diagonal crosses? Or maybe one X pattern leading to output 2. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the count of the number of times the number appears in the diagonals. For Example1, the main diagonal is8,8,8 (sum 24?), but output is2. Not matching.\n\nAnother thought: The output could be the number of distinct rectangles formed by non-zero elements. But that might be complicated.\n\nWait, let's look at Example3 and 4. Both output3. Their matrices are:\n\nExample3:\n\n0,1,1\n\n0,1,1\n\n1,0,0\n\nThe non-zero elements form two regions: the two 1s in the top-right of the first two rows, and the 1 in the bottom-left. So maybe three regions? Or two. But output is3. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, the number of rows that have the same elements. Example3's first two rows are same, third is different. So two rows same. Output is3. Doesn't match.\n\nAnother idea: The output is the number of corners (positions (0,0), (0,2), (2,0), (2,2)) that are non-zero. Let's check:\n\nExample0: (0,0)=5, (0,2)=0, (2,0)=0, (2,2)=0. So one corner. Output1. That fits.\n\nExample1: All four corners are8. So four corners. Output2. Doesn't fit.\n\nExample2: Corners are5,5,5,5. Four corners. Output2. Doesn't fit.\n\nExample3: Corners are0,1,1,0. Two corners. Output3. Doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. So only Example0 fits here. Not helpful.\n\nAlternative approach: Let's think of the output as the number of \"arms\" or directions in which the non-zero elements extend from the center. For example, Example0's non-zero elements might form a cross with arms in certain directions, counting the arms.\n\nExample0's non-zero elements:\n\n(0,0), (0,1), (1,0), (1,2), (2,1). The center is (1,1)=0. The non-zero elements are around the center. So perhaps up, left, right, down, and maybe diagonals. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the output could be the number of adjacent pairs of non-zero elements. For Example0, each non-zero element has neighbors. Let's count pairs. It's getting complicated.\n\nAlternatively, think of the matrix as representing a digital display (like a seven-segment display). The output could be the number represented. For example, Example6's output is6. In a 3x3 grid, the middle row all filled and the sides filled would form a '0' or '8', but not sure.\n\nAnother idea: The output is the number of times the middle element appears in the matrix. For Example0, middle element is0. It appears 4 times. Output1. No. Example1, middle is8. Appears once. Output2. Doesn't fit.\n\nWait, maybe the output is the number of distinct numbers present. Example0 has 2 (5 and0). Output1. Doesn't fit. Example1 has two (8 and0). Output2. Oh, maybe yes! Let's check:\n\nExample0: elements are5 and0 \u2192 two distinct. Output1. No, doesn't fit. So that's not it.\n\nBut wait, Example1 has elements8 and0 \u2192 two distinct. Output2. Example2:5 and0 \u2192 two distinct. Output2. Example3:0,1 \u2192 two distinct. Output3. So this theory is invalid.\n\nBack to the test input. Test input's matrix is:\n\n[2,0,2]\n\n[0,2,0]\n\n[2,0,2]\n\nNon-zero elements are on the two diagonals and the middle. The structure is the same as Examples1 and2, which output2. So the test output should be2. So the answer is [2].\n\nBut let's make sure there's no other pattern I'm missing. Let's check all examples again.\n\nAnother pattern: The output may correspond to the number of times the same number appears in the four corners. For Example1, all four corners are8, so four. Output2. Doesn't fit. Example0: one corner (5), output1. So 1. Fits here. Example3: two corners (1 and1), output3. Doesn't fit. So this doesn't hold.\n\nAlternatively, the output is the number of 'loops' or enclosed areas in the digits formed by the numbers. For instance, the number 8 has two loops. If the matrix forms an '8', output might be2. But this is speculative.\n\nAlternatively, think of the matrix as a binary grid (non-zero as 1, zero as 0), and the output is the sum of the binary numbers in rows or columns. But for Example0:\n\nBinary rows:\n\n1 1 0 \u2192 6\n\n1 0 1 \u21925\n\n0 1 0 \u21922\n\nSum of rows:6+5+2=13. Not 1.\n\nExample1's binary:\n\n1 0 1 \u21925\n\n0 1 0 \u21922\n\n1 0 1 \u21925\n\nSum:5+2+5=12. Output2. Doesn't fit.\n\nAnother angle: The output is the number of times the middle element is repeated in the matrix. For Example0, middle is0. It appears4 times. Output1. No. Example1's middle is8, appears once. Output2. Doesn't fit.\n\nHmm, this is challenging. Let's try to see if the output is related to the count of certain patterns in the matrix.\n\nExamples where output is2 (Examples1,2, and test input) have matrices where the non-zero elements form an 'X' (both diagonals). So perhaps output is2 for X-shaped matrices.\n\nExamples where output is1 (Examples0,5) have a different pattern. Their non-zero elements are arranged in a way that's not an X. For Example0, the non-zero elements form a sort of 'plus' sign but with the middle missing. Or maybe a diamond.\n\nExamples with output3 (Examples3,4) have a different pattern where the top two rows have two same elements and the third row starts with the same number.\n\nExample6's output is6 and has a vertical line in the middle.\n\nSo the possible patterns:\n\n- X shape (diagonals) \u2192 output2.\n\n- Vertical line (middle column) \u2192 output6.\n\n- Top two rows same, bottom row has a single element \u2192 output3.\n\n- Other patterns (like Example0) \u2192 output1.\n\nIf that's the case, the test input is an X shape, so output should be2.\n\nThus, the answer is [2].",

        "cot_2": "Okay, let's see. I need to figure out the pattern here. Let's look at the training examples one by one. \n\nStarting with Example 0. The input is a 3x3 grid:\n\n[5, 5, 0]\n[5, 0, 5]\n[0, 5, 0]\n\nThe output is [1]. Hmm. Maybe looking for symmetry or some count.

So maybe the number 2 corresponds to some kind of diagonal symmetry?\n\nLooking at Example 3 and 4, their outputs are [3]. Their grids are:\n\nFor Example 3:\n\n[0, 1, 1]\n[0, 1, 1]\n[1, 0, 0]\n\nAnd Example 4:\n\n[0, 8, 8]\n[0, 8, 8]\n[8, 0, 0]\n\nNoticing that the bottom row in both is [1,0,0] and [8,0,0]. Maybe the count of non-zero elements in certain positions?\n\nWait, let's think differently. Maybe the output is the number of times a certain pattern occurs. Let me see the outputs again.\n\nExample 0: Output 1. Example 1 and 2: Output 2. Example 3 and 4: Output 3. Example 5: Output 1. Example 6: Output 6.\n\nLooking at Example 6's input:\n\n[0,5,0]\n[5,5,5]\n[0,5,0]\n\nOutput is [6]. The grid here forms a cross shape with the center being 5 and the surrounding 5s. Maybe the sum of all elements divided by the center element? Let's check. Sum for Example 6: 0+5+0 +5+5+5 +0+5+0 = 25. Divided by center 5 gives 5, but output is 6. Hmm, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the number of times a particular number appears in a certain pattern. Let's count non-zero elements.\n\nIn Example 0: Let's see each row. First row has 5,5,0 \u2192 2. Second row 5,0,5 \u2192 2. Third row 0,5,0 \u21921. Total non-zero is 2+2+1=5. Output is 1. Doesn't match.\n\nWait, maybe the output relates to the number of distinct non-zero numbers. But Example 0 and 1 have only one distinct number each. So that's not it.\n\nLooking for symmetry. Example 0's grid:\n\nRow 1: 5,5,0\n\nRow 2:5,0,5\n\nRow3:0,5,0\n\nIf you check, maybe the grid is symmetric along the vertical axis. Let's see. First row reversed is 0,5,5 which is different from original. Hmm. What about the diagonal? Like top-left to bottom-right. Let's check. The first element is 5, then 0 (second row middle), then 0 (third row third). Not symmetric. Maybe the other diagonal. Top-right to bottom-left. The third element of first row is 0. Middle element is 0. First element of third row is 0. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output counts the number of \"loops\" or enclosed areas in the grid. Like in Example 6, maybe there are 6 zeros arranged in a certain way. Wait, the output is 6 here. Let me see.\n\nExample 6's input has 5s forming a cross. The zeros are around the cross. The number of zeros? Let's count. First row has 0,5,0 \u2192 two zeros. Third row same \u2192 two zeros. Middle row's first and third elements are 5, but the middle is 5. So total zeros: 2+2=4. But output is 6. Not matching.\n\nAnother angle: Maybe the output is related to the number of times the center element (middle of the grid) appears. In Example 0, the center is 0, and the output is 1. Wait, no. Example 1's center is 8, output is 2. Example 2's center is 5, output 2. Hmm. Not directly.\n\nWait, let's look at Example 3. The output is 3. The input grid is:\n\n[0,1,1]\n[0,1,1]\n[1,0,0]\n\nLooking for patterns here. Maybe the number of rows with two consecutive same numbers. First row has two 1s. Second row also two 1s. Third row has two 0s. So three occurrences. But output is 3. That could be a match. Let's check other examples.\n\nExample 4's input:\n\n[0,8,8]\n[0,8,8]\n[8,0,0]\n\nEach of the first two rows has two 8s. Third row has two 0s. So three instances, output is 3. That fits. So the output is the number of rows (including all three rows) where there are exactly two consecutive same numbers. Let's test this.\n\nExample 0: Rows are [5,5,0] \u2192 two 5s (consecutive). Second row [5,0,5] \u2192 no consecutive. Third row [0,5,0] \u2192 no. So total 1. Output is 1. That matches.\n\nExample 1: [8,0,8], [0,8,0], [8,0,8]. Each row has two 8s but not consecutive. Wait, first row: 8,0,8 \u2192 not consecutive. So no. Then how does Example 1 have output 2? Wait, maybe this idea is incorrect.\n\nWait, maybe the output counts the number of rows and columns that have the same elements. For example, in Example 1:\n\nRows:\n\nRow1:8,0,8\n\nRow2:0,8,0\n\nRow3:8,0,8\n\nIf you check columns:\n\nColumn1:8,0,8\n\nColumn2:0,8,0\n\nColumn3:8,0,8\n\nSo each column is same as the corresponding row. So maybe the number of rows that are palindromic. Row1 is 8,0,8 which is a palindrome. Row2 is 0,8,0 \u2192 palindrome. Row3 is 8,0,8 \u2192 palindrome. So three palindromic rows, but output is 2. Hmm, no.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the number of rows that are palindromic and the number of columns that are palindromic, but that might not fit.\n\nWait Example 1's output is 2. Let me see again. If the grid is symmetric in some way. For instance, if the grid is symmetric along both the vertical and horizontal axes. Wait, Example 1's grid looks like it's symmetric along the vertical and horizontal center lines. So each row is a palindrome, and each column is a palindrome. But how does that relate to output 2?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the count of the number of times a certain value appears in the grid. For Example 0, there are 5s appearing 5 times. Wait, let's count:\n\nExample 0: 5 appears in first row twice, second row twice, third row once \u2192 total 5. Output is 1. Not matching.\n\nWait, perhaps the output is the number of \"islands\" of non-zero numbers. But in Example 0, the 5s form a sort of cross. But how would that be counted? Maybe as one connected region. But output is 1. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, think about the positions of non-zero elements. For example, in Example 0:\n\nPositions (0,0), (0,1), (1,0), (1,2), (2,1). If we consider the grid as a 3x3, perhaps the pattern is a 'V' shape. But how does that lead to output 1?\n\nWait, maybe the output represents the number of 2x2 subgrids that sum to a certain value. Let's check.\n\nIn Example 0, possible 2x2 subgrids:\n\nTop-left: 5,5;5,0 \u2192 sum 15. Next:5,0;0,5 \u2192 sum 10. Then 0,5;5,0 \u2192 sum 10. Then 5,0;0,5;0,0 \u2192 not sure. Not sure if this is the case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is related to the number of times the same number appears in a diagonal. For example, in Example 1, the main diagonals are 8,8,8 and 8,8,8. So two diagonals with three same numbers. But output is 2. That could fit. Let's check other examples.\n\nExample 2: Input is same as Example 1 but with 5s. The main diagonals would be 5,5,5 and 5,5,5. So two. Output is 2. That matches. Example 0's diagonals: main diagonal is 5,0,0. Other diagonal is 0,0,0. So no. Output is 1. Hmm, not matching. So that's probably not.\n\nWait, maybe the number of distinct diagonals where all elements are the same. But in Example 0, the main diagonal is 5,0,0 \u2192 not same. The anti-diagonal is 0,0,0 \u2192 all zeros, but zeros are considered here? But output is 1. Maybe the count is the number of such diagonals. But in Example 0, anti-diagonal is all zeros. But the output is 1. But then Example 1's diagonals are both all 8s. So two. Output 2. That fits. Example 2 same as 1, output 2. Example 3's diagonals: main is 0,1,0; anti is 1,1,1. So only the anti-diagonal has all 1s. But output is 3, which doesn't match. So that's probably not the pattern.\n\nWait, let's look at Example 3. Output is 3. The input is:\n\n[0,1,1]\n\n[0,1,1]\n\n[1,0,0]\n\nThe anti-diagonal here is 1 (third element of first row), 1 (second of second row), 1 (first of third row). All 1s. So one diagonal. But output is 3, so maybe that's not the case.\n\nAnother idea: the output is the number of pairs of mirrored rows. For example, in Example 1, rows 1 and 3 are the same. So that's one pair. But output is 2, which may not fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the sum of the digits in a certain way. Example 6's output is 6, and the sum of elements is 25 (5*5), but 25 divided by 5 is 5, not 6. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, let's think of the grid as a binary matrix where non-zero elements are 1. Then perhaps the output is the number of 1's in some transformed matrix. But in Example 0, there are 5 non-zeros, output 1. Doesn't match.\n\nWait, maybe the output is the number of times the pattern \"0, x, 0\" appears in the rows or columns. For example, in Example 0, third row is [0,5,0], which is \"0,x,0\". So that's one occurrence. Output is 1. Example 1's third row is [8,0,8] \u2192 not \"0,x,0\". Second row is [0,8,0], which is. So one occurrence. But output is 2. Hmm. Not sure.\n\nAnother approach: Let's look at all the examples and see if we can find a common pattern.\n\nExample 0 Output:1\n\nExample1 Output:2\n\nExample2 Output:2\n\nExample3 Output:3\n\nExample4 Output:3\n\nExample5 Output:1\n\nExample6 Output:6\n\nLooking at the outputs, they might be related to the count of certain positions. For instance, maybe the center element (2nd row, 2nd column) is counted in some way. For example 0, the center is 0. Output 1. Not sure. Example1's center is 8. Output 2. Example2's center is 5, output 2. Example3's center is 1, output 3. Example4's center is 8, output3. Example5's center is 0, output 1. Example6's center is 5, output 6. So the output could be the center element's value divided by something. Like example6's center is 5, output 6. Doesn't fit. But 5*1.2=6. Maybe not.\n\nWait, Example6's input grid is:\n\nRow1:0,5,0\n\nRow2:5,5,5\n\nRow3:0,5,0\n\nIf you look, the 5s form a cross. The number of 5s is 5. But output is 6. Hmm.\n\nAlternative idea: The output is the number of edges (adjacent cells) between zeros and non-zeros. Let's try Example0:\n\nNon-zero cells: positions (0,0), (0,1), (1,0), (1,2), (2,1). Each non-zero cell has neighboring cells. Let's count edges where a non-zero is adjacent to a zero.\n\n(0,0): neighbors right (0,1 is non-zero), down (1,0 is non-zero). So no edges here.\n\n(0,1): neighbors left (non-zero), right (0), down (0). So two edges (right and down).\n\n(1,0): neighbors up (non-zero), right (0), down (non-zero). So right edge.\n\n(1,2): neighbors left (0), up (non-zero), down (non-zero). Left edge.\n\n(2,1): neighbors up (non-zero), left (0), right (0). Two edges.\n\nTotal edges: 2 (from 0,1) + 1 (1,0) + 1 (1,2) + 2 (2,1) = 6 edges. Output is 1. Doesn't match.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the number of regions of non-zero cells. In Example0, the non-zero cells are connected in a sort of 'X' shape, forming a single connected region. Output 1. That fits. Example1's non-zero cells are all 8s arranged in a checkerboard pattern. Are they connected? Let's see:\n\nExample1's grid:\n\n8 0 8\n\n0 8 0\n\n8 0 8\n\nThe 8s are in positions (0,0), (0,2), (1,1), (2,0), (2,2). These are diagonally connected. So connected via diagonals? If diagonals are considered connected, then it's one region, but output is 2. So maybe not. Alternatively, if regions are considered as orthogonally connected (up, down, left, right), then each 8 is isolated. So there are 5 regions. Output is 2. Doesn't fit.\n\nAnother approach: Let's think of the output as the number of times a certain pattern appears. For example, maybe the number of 'L' shapes. Or maybe the number of 'cross' patterns.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the number of 2x2 squares that have exactly two non-zero elements. Let's check Example0. The 2x2 squares:\n\nTop-left: 5,5,5,0 \u2192 three non-zero. Next to the right:5,0,0,5 \u2192 two non-zero. Then next row's squares: 5,0,0,5 \u2192 two non-zero. And so on. Let's count for Example0:\n\nFirst square (top-left): 3 non-zero. Next (top-middle): 5,0 in first row; 0,5 in second. That's two non-zero. Then next (top-right): 0,5 in first row (but third row starts with 0). Not sure. Maybe this is getting complicated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is the number of occurrences where a non-zero is surrounded by exactly two zeros. Let's see. For Example0:\n\nTake cell (0,0): 5. Neighbors are (0,1)=5, (1,0)=5. No zeros around. So no.\n\nCell (0,1):5. Neighbors (0,0)=5, (0,2)=0, (1,1)=0. So two zeros. So this counts as one occurrence.\n\nCell (1,0):5. Neighbors (0,0)=5, (1,1)=0, (2,0)=0. Two zeros. Another occurrence.\n\nCell (1,2):5. Neighbors (0,2)=0, (1,1)=0, (2,2)=0. Three zeros. So three zeros, but the output would count if exactly two. So this doesn't count.\n\nCell (2,1):5. Neighbors (2,0)=0, (1,1)=0, (2,2)=0. Three zeros again.\n\nSo in Example0, two cells with exactly two zero neighbors. But output is 1. So that's not matching.\n\nAnother angle: Looking at the outputs, the numbers 1,2,3,6. 6 is a higher number. Example6's output is 6. Looking at the input for Example6, maybe it's the sum of the positions of non-zero elements. For example, in Example6:\n\nRow1: (0,1) \u2192 5\n\nRow2: (1,0), (1,1), (1,2) \u2192 all 5s.\n\nRow3: (2,1) \u21925.\n\nPositions sum: (0,1) is position 0+1=1, (1,0)=1+0=1, (1,1)=2, (1,2)=3, (2,1)=3. Summing these: 1+1+2+3+3=10. Not 6. Doesn't fit.\n\nWait, but output is 6. Maybe the count of non-zero elements. In Example6, there are 5 non-zero elements. No, output is 6. So that's not it.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the sum of the distinct digits. For Example0, all are 5s and 0s. Sum of distinct non-zero is 5. Output 1. Doesn't fit.\n\nAnother idea: The output could be the number of corners (top-left, top-right, bottom-left, bottom-right) that are non-zero. Let's check.\n\nExample0's corners are 5 (top-left), 0 (top-right), 0 (bottom-left), 0 (bottom-right). So only one non-zero corner. Output is 1. That matches.\n\nExample1's corners: 8,8 (top-left and top-right are 8 and 8?), wait wait:\n\nExample1's input:\n\nRow1: [8,0,8] \u2192 top-left is 8, top-right is8.\n\nRow3: [8,0,8] \u2192 bottom-left is8, bottom-right is8.\n\nSo four corners: 8,8,8,8. All non-zero. So four, but output is 2. Doesn't fit. So that's not it.\n\nBut Example6's corners are 0,0,0,0. Output is6. So that's not.\n\nHmm. Maybe the output is the count of the number of times the middle element appears in the grid. Example0's middle is 0. It appears three times (in the middle and two others). Output is 1. Doesn't fit.\n\nWait, let's go back to Example3 and 4. Both have output 3. Their grids:\n\nExample3:\n\nRow1: 0,1,1\n\nRow2:0,1,1\n\nRow3:1,0,0\n\nLooking at the number of times '1' appears in columns:\n\nColumn1: 0,0,1 \u2192 one 1.\n\nColumn2:1,1,0 \u2192 two 1s.\n\nColumn3:1,1,0 \u2192 two 1s.\n\nTotal 5 1s. Output is 3. Not matching.\n\nAlternatively, the output might be the number of rows that have exactly two of the same number. For Example3:\n\nRow1: two 1s \u2192 yes.\n\nRow2: two 1s \u2192 yes.\n\nRow3: two 0s \u2192 yes.\n\nTotal three rows. Output 3. That fits. Let's check other examples.\n\nExample0:\n\nRow1: two 5s \u2192 yes.\n\nRow2: two 5s \u2192 yes.\n\nRow3: one 5 \u2192 no.\n\nSo two rows. But output is 1. So this doesn't fit.\n\nWait, but Example3's output is 3, which is the count of rows with exactly two same elements. But Example0 has two such rows, output is 1. So that's not it.\n\nAlternative approach: Maybe the output is the number of \"islands\" of zeros. Let's see. In Example0, zeros are in certain positions. Let's see the zeros:\n\nExample0's grid:\n\nRow1: 5,5,0\n\nRow2:5,0,5\n\nRow3:0,5,0\n\nZeros are at (0,2), (1,1), (2,0), (2,2). Are these connected? (0,2) is connected to (1,1) diagonally? If considering only orthogonal connections, then (0,2) is isolated. (1,1) is connected to (2,0)? No. (2,0) is connected to (2,2) via (2,1) which is 5. So zeros are four separate islands. But output is 1. Doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. I'm stuck. Let's think of another angle. Maybe the output is related to the number of distinct elements. For example, Example0 has two distinct elements (5 and 0), but output is 1. Example1 has two elements (8 and 0), output 2. Example3 has two elements (0 and1), output3. So that doesn't fit.\n\nWait, maybe the output is the sum of the counts of each distinct non-zero number divided by the number itself. For Example0: 5 occurs 5 times. 5/5=1. Output 1. That fits. Example1: 8 occurs 5 times. 5/8=0.625 \u2192 no. Output is 2. Doesn't fit. Example6: 5 occurs 5 times. 5/5=1. Output is6. No.\n\nAnother idea: The output is the number of times the non-zero elements form a certain pattern. For example, in Example0 and 5, the output is 1, which could be the number of 'T' shapes. Let's see. Example0's grid:\n\nRow1:5,5,0\n\nRow2:5,0,5\n\nRow3:0,5,0\n\nIf you look, the center is 0, and the surrounding cells have 5s. Maybe the pattern is a 'plus' sign. But in Example0, the plus would be in the middle, but it's 0. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the number of 2x2 subgrids where the sum is even. Let's check. Example0's first 2x2 subgrid (top-left) is 5,5,5,0. Sum 15. Odd. Next subgrid (top-middle) 5,0,0,5. Sum 10, even. So that's one. Then the next row's subgrids: 5,0,0,5 sum 10 even. Another one. 0,5,5,0 sum 10 even. Another. Then the next rows: 5,0,5,0 sum 10 even. So total of four even sums. But output is 1. Doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. I'm really stuck. Let's look for another pattern. Maybe the output is the count of the number of times a certain digit appears in the middle row or column.\n\nExample0's middle row is [5,0,5]. The count of 5s here is 2. Output is 1. No.\n\nExample1's middle row is [0,8,0]. The count of 8s is 1. Output is 2. No.\n\nWait, maybe the output is the number of times the middle element appears in the entire grid. Example0's middle element is 0. It appears three times. Output is1. No. Example1's middle element is8. Appears five times. Output2. No.\n\nAlternative approach: Let's look at all outputs and see if they relate to the positions of non-zero elements.\n\nExample0: Output1.\n\nNon-zero elements are at positions (0,0), (0,1), (1,0), (1,2), (2,1). Maybe the count of certain positions. For example, positions where row index plus column index is even. Let's see:\n\n(0,0): 0+0=0 even \u2192 count.\n\n(0,1):0+1=1 odd.\n\n(1,0):1+0=1 odd.\n\n(1,2):1+2=3 odd.\n\n(2,1):2+1=3 odd.\n\nOnly one position even sum. Output1. That fits.\n\nExample1: non-zero positions are (0,0), (0,2), (1,1), (2,0), (2,2). Sums:\n\n(0,0):0 \u2192 even.\n\n(0,2):0+2=2 even.\n\n(1,1):2 even.\n\n(2,0):2+0=2 even.\n\n(2,2):4 even.\n\nTotal of 5 even sums. Output is2. Doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. Not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the count of non-zero elements in the main diagonal. For Example0, main diagonal is 5 (0,0), 0 (1,1), 0 (2,2). Only one non-zero. Output1. That fits. Example1's main diagonal is 8,8,8 \u2192 three non-zero. Output2. Doesn't fit.\n\nAnother Idea: Maybe the output is the number of times the same number appears in a cross pattern (horizontal and vertical). For instance, in Example6, the cross is centered at (1,1) which is 5. The cross includes all 5s. The number of 5s is 5, but output is6. Not sure.\n\nWait, maybe the output is the sum of the digits of the non-zero elements. For Example0, sum is 5+5+5+5+5=25. Output1. No. Example6 sum is 5*5=25. Output6. No.\n\nAnother possible pattern: The output is the number of different directions (up, down, left, right) that have the same number as the center. For Example0, center is 0. No directions have 0. Output1. Doesn't fit. Example6's center is5. All four directions (up, down, left, right) are5. So four directions. Output6. Doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the number of corners that are zero. Example0: three corners are zero. Output1. No. Example6: all four corners are zero. Output6. No.\n\nAt this point, I'm really struggling. Let's try to look for something else. Maybe the output is the number of times a certain sequence occurs in the grid. For example, the sequence [x, 0, x] in rows or columns.\n\nIn Example0:\n\nRow1: [5,5,0] \u2192 no.\n\nRow2: [5,0,5] \u2192 yes.\n\nRow3: [0,5,0] \u2192 no.\n\nColumns:\n\nColumn1:5,5,0 \u2192 no.\n\nColumn2:5,0,5 \u2192 yes.\n\nColumn3:0,5,0 \u2192 no.\n\nSo two occurrences (row2 and column2). Output is1. Doesn't fit.\n\nExample1 has:\n\nRow1:8,0,8 \u2192 yes.\n\nRow2:0,8,0 \u2192 yes.\n\nRow3:8,0,8 \u2192 yes.\n\nColumns:\n\nColumn1:8,0,8 \u2192 yes.\n\nColumn2:0,8,0 \u2192 yes.\n\nColumn3:8,0,8 \u2192 yes.\n\nSo 3 rows and 3 columns with [x,0,x] pattern. Total 6. But output is2. No.\n\nAnother Idea: Maybe the output is the number of cells that are equal to the sum of their adjacent cells. For example, in Example6's center cell (5), the sum of adjacent cells is 5 (up) +5 (down) +5 (left) +5 (right) =20. 5 is not equal to 20. So no.\n\nAlternatively, cells that are equal to the product of their adjacent cells. Not likely.\n\nAlternatively, the output could be the number of times a cell is surrounded by exactly two non-zero cells. Let's check Example0:\n\nCell (0,0) is surrounded by 5 (right) and 5 (down). So two. So counts.\n\nCell (0,1) is surrounded by 5 (left), 0 (right), 0 (down). Two non-zero (left and up? Up is row0, so no). Wait, neighbors are left (5), right (0), down (0). So one non-zero. No.\n\nCell (1,0): neighbors up (5), right (0), down (0). One non-zero.\n\nCell (1,2): neighbors up (5), left (0), down (0). One non-zero.\n\nCell (2,1): neighbors up (0), left (0), right (0), down (none). So zero non-zero.\n\nSo only cell (0,0) has exactly two non-zero neighbors. So output1. That matches Example0's output.\n\nTesting this for Example1:\n\nEach cell in Example1's non-zero positions:\n\nCell (0,0): neighbors right (0), down (0). So two zeros. No non-zero neighbors. So no.\n\nCell (0,2): neighbors left (0), down (0). So no.\n\nCell (1,1): neighbors all four directions: up (0), down (0), left (8), right (0). So one non-zero.\n\nCell (2,0): neighbors up (0), right (0). No non-zero.\n\nCell (2,2): neighbors up (0), left (0). No.\n\nSo no cells in Example1 have exactly two non-zero neighbors. But output is2. So this doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. So this pattern works for Example0 but not others.\n\nLet me check Example6:\n\nCells in Example6:\n\nNon-zero cells are:\n\n(0,1) \u2192 neighbors: left (0), right (0), down (5). So one non-zero.\n\n(1,0): neighbors up (0), right (5), down (0). One non-zero.\n\n(1,1): up (5), down (5), left (5), right (5). Four non-zero.\n\n(1,2): up (0), left (5), down (0). One non-zero.\n\n(2,1): up (5), left (0), right (0). One non-zero.\n\nSo none of the non-zero cells have exactly two non-zero neighbors. But output is6. So this pattern doesn't fit.\n\nAnother Idea: Maybe the output is the number of cells that are the same as their mirror cell across the center. For example, cell (0,0) mirrors to (2,2). In Example0:\n\n(0,0) is5, (2,2) is0 \u2192 not same.\n\n(0,1) is5, (2,1) is5 \u2192 same.\n\n(0,2) is0, (2,0) is0 \u2192 same.\n\n(1,0) is5, (1,2) is5 \u2192 same.\n\nSo total three pairs of mirrored cells. Output1. Doesn't fit.\n\nBut Example1's grid is symmetric. So all mirrored pairs would be same. So 4 pairs ( (0,0)-(2,2), (0,2)-(2,0), (1,0)-(1,2), (0,1)-(2,1) ), each of which are same. So 4 pairs \u2192 4 cells counted. Output is2. So not matching.\n\nAlternatively, the number of mirrored pairs. For Example0, three mirrored pairs. Output1. No.\n\nThis is getting frustrating. Let's look for another possible pattern.\n\nWait, maybe the output is the number of rows where the sum is divisible by 5 (or some number). For Example0:\n\nRow1 sum:10. Row2 sum:10. Row3 sum:5. Divisible by5. All three rows. Output1. Doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, Example6's rows sum to 5, 15,5. All divisible by5. Output is6. Not sure.\n\nAnother Idea: The output is the number of letters formed by the non-zero cells. Like in Example0, the non-zero cells form a 'V' shape. Maybe output is 1. Example1's grid forms an 'X' shape, which has two intersecting lines, output2. Example3 and 4 form three lines or something. Example6 forms a cross, which might be considered as one shape, but output is6. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the output could be the number of diagonal lines. In Example1, there are two diagonals (both filled with 8s), so output2. Example0 has no such diagonals, output1. But why 1? Example0's output is1. Not sure.\n\nWait, let's think back to the test input:\n\nTest Input:\n[2,0,2]\n[0,2,0]\n[2,0,2]\n\nThis grid looks similar to Example1 and Example2. Example1 and 2 have output 2. So the test input's output might be2. But let's confirm.\n\nLooking at the pattern in the training examples where grids like Example1 and 2 (alternating 8s and 0s in a checkerboard pattern) have output 2. Similarly, the test input has a similar checkerboard pattern with 2s and 0s. So the output might be2. \n\nBut why do Example1 and 2 have output2? Maybe because there are two diagonals with all the same numbers. In the test input, the main diagonal is 2,2,2 and the anti-diagonal is 2,2,2. So two diagonals. Output would be2.\n\nBut how does this fit with other examples? For Example3, the anti-diagonal is all 1s, but the main diagonal is 0,1,0. So only one diagonal. Output3. So that's not matching.\n\nAlternatively, the output is the number of times the same number appears in both diagonals. For Example1, both diagonals are all 8s, so two diagonals \u2192 output2. Example2 same. Example3 has anti-diagonal all 1s, main diagonal 0,1,0. So one \u2192 output3. But Example3's output is3. So that doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. This is really tricky. Given the time I've spent and the test input resembling Example1 and 2, I'll go with output [2]."
