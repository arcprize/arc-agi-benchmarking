        "cot_1": "Okay, let's see here. I need to figure out the pattern between the input and output in the training examples and then apply that to the test input. Let's start by looking at Example 0.\n\nIn the input of Example 0, there's a list of 10 rows. The first five rows are all zeros. Then starting from the sixth row, some numbers appear. The output seems to be a rearrangement of these rows. Let me compare them.\n\nLooking at the input for Example 0:\n\nThe last row of the input is [2,4,3,9], and in the output, the first row is [2,4,3,9]. The next row in the output is [2,0,3,9], which is the second last row of the input. Then [0,0,3,9], which is the third last and fourth last. Wait, the input's sixth row is [0,0,0,9], and the fifth row is [0,0,0,0]. But in the output, the fifth and sixth rows are [0,0,0,9] and [0,0,0,9]. Hmm, maybe there's some symmetry here.\n\nWait, the output in Example 0 has the same first and last rows. The second and second last are the same as well. Let me check:\n\nOutput rows:\nRow 0: [2,4,3,9] (input's last row)\nRow 1: [2,0,3,9] (input's 9th row)\nRow 2: [0,0,3,9] (input's 8th row)\nRow 3: [0,0,3,9] (input's 7th row)\nRow 4: [0,0,0,9] (input's 6th row)\nRow 5: [0,0,0,9] (input's 6th row again?)\nWait, the input's 6th row is [0,0,0,9], and in the output, rows 4 and 5 are both [0,0,0,9]. Then rows 6 and 7 are [0,0,3,9], which are input's 7th and 8th rows. Then rows 8 and 9 are the input's 9th and 10th (last) rows.\n\nSo the output is structured as a mirror around the middle. Like, the first half of the output is the reverse of the non-zero rows from the input, and then the second half mirrors back. Wait, maybe the output is taking the non-zero rows from the input, reversing them, then duplicating the middle part to create symmetry. Let me count the non-zero rows in input.\n\nIn Example 0's input, the first five rows are all zeros. Then rows 5 (0-based index 5) is [0,0,0,9], 6 is [0,0,3,9], 7 is [0,0,3,9], 8 is [2,0,3,9], 9 is [2,4,3,9]. So there are 5 non-zero rows (indices 5 to 9). The output has 10 rows, which is the same as the input. The output starts with the non-zero rows in reverse order, then mirrors them. Let's see:\n\nOriginal non-zero rows (input rows 5-9):\n\nRow5: [0,0,0,9]\nRow6: [0,0,3,9]\nRow7: [0,0,3,9]\nRow8: [2,0,3,9]\nRow9: [2,4,3,9]\n\nReversed order would be row9, row8, row7, row6, row5. But in the output, the first 5 rows are [2,4,3,9], [2,0,3,9], [0,0,3,9], [0,0,3,9], [0,0,0,9]. Then rows 5-9 are [0,0,0,9], [0,0,3,9], [0,0,3,9], [2,0,3,9], [2,4,3,9]. Wait, no. Wait the output's rows 0-4 are the reversed non-zero rows (from 9 to 5?), and then rows 5-9 are the same as rows 4-0 again, but maybe mirrored. Wait no. Let me list the output rows:\n\nOutput rows:\n\n0: [2,4,3,9] (input row9)\n1: [2,0,3,9] (input row8)\n2: [0,0,3,9] (input row7)\n3: [0,0,3,9] (input row6)\n4: [0,0,0,9] (input row5)\n5: [0,0,0,9] (input row5 again)\n6: [0,0,3,9] (input row6)\n7: [0,0,3,9] (input row7)\n8: [2,0,3,9] (input row8)\n9: [2,4,3,9] (input row9)\n\nSo the output is constructed by taking the non-zero rows (5-9) from the input, reversed (rows9,8,7,6,5), then appending the same reversed list except the first element. Wait, or it's a mirror. So the first half is the reversed non-zero rows, and the second half is the same list but reversed again. Wait, maybe the output is a palindrome made from the reversed non-zero rows. Let me check:\n\nThe reversed non-zero rows are [row9, row8, row7, row6, row5]. So that's 5 rows. Then to make a palindrome of 10 rows, you take the reversed list and then append the same list again, but perhaps with some adjustment. Wait, but 5 +5 =10. But in the output, the first five rows are the reversed list, then the next five rows are the same reversed list again. But in the output, rows 5-9 are the same as rows 4-0. So the output is:\n\nTake the reversed non-zero rows (5 elements), then append the reversed list again but mirrored. Wait, no. Let's see:\n\nIn the output, rows 0-4 are [row9, row8, row7, row6, row5], and rows5-9 are [row5, row6, row7, row8, row9]. So the output is the reversed non-zero rows followed by the original non-zero rows. But wait, in example0, the non-zero input rows are rows5-9. The output is first reversed non-zero rows (row9,8,7,6,5), then the original non-zero rows (5,6,7,8,9). But that's not exactly the case. Let me check:\n\nOriginal non-zero rows (input rows 5-9):\n\nrow5: [0,0,0,9]\n\nrow6: [0,0,3,9]\n\nrow7: [0,0,3,9]\n\nrow8: [2,0,3,9]\n\nrow9: [2,4,3,9]\n\nReversed would be row9, row8, row7, row6, row5.\n\nSo the first five rows of the output are row9,8,7,6,5. Then the next five rows are row5,6,7,8,9 again. Wait, no. The output's rows5 is [0,0,0,9] which is row5. Then row6 is [0,0,3,9] which is row6. So rows5-9 are the original non-zero rows (5-9). Wait, but in the output, rows0-4 are reversed non-zero, rows5-9 are the original non-zero. But that would make the output have 10 rows. Let's count:\n\nOriginal input has 10 rows (0-9). Output is 10 rows.\n\nIn example0's output, rows0-4: reversed non-zero (rows9,8,7,6,5)\n\nrows5-9: same as the original non-zero rows (rows5-9).\n\nWait, but row5 in the input is [0,0,0,9], which becomes row5 in the output again. So the output is:\n\nFirst half: reversed non-zero rows.\n\nSecond half: original non-zero rows.\n\nBut in example0's output:\n\nFirst five rows: [2,4,3,9], [2,0,3,9], [0,0,3,9], [0,0,3,9], [0,0,0,9]\n\nThen next five: [0,0,0,9], [0,0,3,9], [0,0,3,9], [2,0,3,9], [2,4,3,9]\n\nWait, the fifth row is [0,0,0,9] (input row5), then sixth is [0,0,3,9] (input row6), etc. So the second half is the same as the original non-zero rows. But that would make the output the reversed non-zero followed by original non-zero. But then the output length is 10, which is correct.\n\nBut in Example0's output, the fifth row is [0,0,0,9], which is the same as the fourth row. So perhaps the first half is reversed non-zero, then the second half is the non-zero rows again. Let's check for example1.\n\nExample1's input:\n\nThe input has rows 0-9. The first five are all zeros. The non-zero rows start at row5: [0,0,0,2], row6: [0,0,0,2], row7: [0,8,0,2], row8: [0,3,8,2], row9: [3,3,8,2]. So non-zero rows are 5-9 (assuming leading zeros but the row has a non-zero in the last element). The output for example1:\n\nFirst five rows: [3,3,8,2], [0,3,8,2], [0,8,0,2], [0,0,0,2], [0,0,0,2]\n\nThen rows5-9: [0,0,0,2], [0,0,0,2], [0,8,0,2], [0,3,8,2], [3,3,8,2]\n\nWait, in the output, the first five rows are reversed non-zero rows (row9,8,7,6,5). Then rows5-9 are [0,0,0,2] (row5), [0,0,0,2] (row6?), but row6 in input was [0,0,0,2], same as row5. Then row7 is [0,8,0,2], row8 is [0,3,8,2], row9 is [3,3,8,2]. Wait, no. Let's check:\n\nOriginal non-zero rows in example1 input:\n\nrow5: [0,0,0,2]\n\nrow6: [0,0,0,2]\n\nrow7: [0,8,0,2]\n\nrow8: [0,3,8,2]\n\nrow9: [3,3,8,2]\n\nReversed non-zero rows would be row9,8,7,6,5: [3,3,8,2], [0,3,8,2], [0,8,0,2], [0,0,0,2], [0,0,0,2]\n\nSo the first five rows of the output are these reversed rows. Then the next five rows are [0,0,0,2], [0,0,0,2], [0,8,0,2], [0,3,8,2], [3,3,8,2]. Wait, that's the same as rows5-9 of the output. So rows5-9 of the output are the same as the original non-zero rows. But rows5-9 of the input are [0,0,0,2], [0,0,0,2], [0,8,0,2], [0,3,8,2], [3,3,8,2]. But in the output, rows5-9 are [0,0,0,2], [0,0,0,2], [0,8,0,2], [0,3,8,2], [3,3,8,2], which is the same as the original rows5-9 except that the last two rows are swapped? Wait, input row8 is [0,3,8,2], row9 is [3,3,8,2]. So in the output's rows5-9, row9 is [3,3,8,2], which is the same as input's row9. Wait, maybe the output's second half is the same as the original non-zero rows. Let me check:\n\nFor example1's output:\n\nFirst five rows (0-4): reversed non-zero rows (9,8,7,6,5)\n\nThen next five (5-9): same as original non-zero rows (5,6,7,8,9). But in example1's input, the non-zero rows are 5-9. So output's rows5 is input row5, row6 is row6, etc. So yes, output's second half is the original non-zero rows.\n\nWait, but in example0, the output's second half is the same as the original non-zero rows. Let's check:\n\nExample0's input non-zero rows are 5-9. Output rows5-9 are input rows5-9. So the pattern is: the output is constructed by first reversing the non-zero rows (rows9 to5) and placing them in the first half (rows0-4), then appending the original non-zero rows (rows5-9) as the second half (rows5-9). That makes the output a combination of reversed non-zero rows followed by original non-zero rows.\n\nBut wait, the total number of rows in the output is 10, which is the same as the input. So for both examples, the input has 10 rows, and the output also has 10. The first five rows are the reversed non-zero rows, and the next five are the original non-zero rows. But wait, in example0, the reversed non-zero rows are 5 rows (since there are 5 non-zero rows: 5-9). Then the original non-zero rows are 5 rows. So total 10. Similarly for example1.\n\nSo the pattern is: take the non-zero rows (assuming they are the latter half of the input), reverse them, and place them as the first half of the output. Then append the original non-zero rows as the second half of the output. But how do we determine which rows are non-zero? In both examples, the first five rows of the input are all zeros, and the next five have at least one non-zero element. So perhaps the pattern is that the input's rows are split into two halves: first half (rows0-4) all zeros, and the second half (rows5-9) non-zero. Then the output is made by reversing the second half (rows5-9) to form the first five rows of the output, then appending the original second half as the next five rows.\n\nWait, that seems to fit. Let's check example0:\n\nInput rows5-9 (second half) are:\n\n[0,0,0,9]\n\n[0,0,3,9]\n\n[0,0,3,9]\n\n[2,0,3,9]\n\n[2,4,3,9]\n\nReversed, these become:\n\n[2,4,3,9], [2,0,3,9], [0,0,3,9], [0,0,3,9], [0,0,0,9]\n\nWhich is the first five rows of the output. Then the next five rows are the original rows5-9:\n\n[0,0,0,9], [0,0,3,9], [0,0,3,9], [2,0,3,9], [2,4,3,9]\n\nWait, but in the output for example0, the next five rows are:\n\nRow5: [0,0,0,9]\n\nRow6: [0,0,3,9]\n\nRow7: [0,0,3,9]\n\nRow8: [2,0,3,9]\n\nRow9: [2,4,3,9]\n\nWhich matches the original rows5-9. So yes, the output is the reversed second half followed by the original second half. So the pattern is to split the input into two halves (first 5 rows and last 5 rows), reverse the last 5, and then concatenate them with the original last 5.\n\nBut wait, in example1, the last five rows (rows5-9) of the input are:\n\nrow5: [0,0,0,2]\n\nrow6: [0,0,0,2]\n\nrow7: [0,8,0,2]\n\nrow8: [0,3,8,2]\n\nrow9: [3,3,8,2]\n\nReversed, they become:\n\nrow9, row8, row7, row6, row5 \u2192 which are the first five rows of the output. Then the next five are the original rows5-9.\n\nBut in example1's output, the rows5-9 are:\n\n[0,0,0,2], [0,0,0,2], [0,8,0,2], [0,3,8,2], [3,3,8,2]\n\nWhich is exactly the original rows5-9. So yes, the pattern is: take the last five rows of the input, reverse them, then append the original last five rows. So the output is reversed_last5 + original_last5.\n\nSo for the test input, which has 10 rows:\n\nThe input's rows5-9 are:\n\n[0,1,0,0]\n\n[7,1,0,0]\n\n[7,1,3,0]\n\n[7,1,3,3]\n\n[7,1,4,4]\n\nReversing these would give:\n\n[7,1,4,4], [7,1,3,3], [7,1,3,0], [7,1,0,0], [0,1,0,0]\n\nThen the output should be these reversed rows followed by the original rows5-9.\n\nSo the first five rows of the output are:\n\n[7,1,4,4]\n\n[7,1,3,3]\n\n[7,1,3,0]\n\n[7,1,0,0]\n\n[0,1,0,0]\n\nThen the next five rows are:\n\n[0,1,0,0]\n\n[7,1,0,0]\n\n[7,1,3,0]\n\n[7,1,3,3]\n\n[7,1,4,4]\n\nSo the full output would be:\n\n[7,1,4,4]\n\n[7,1,3,3]\n\n[7,1,3,0]\n\n[7,1,0,0]\n\n[0,1,0,0]\n\n[0,1,0,0]\n\n[7,1,0,0]\n\n[7,1,3,0]\n\n[7,1,3,3]\n\n[7,1,4,4]\n\nLet me check if this matches the training examples' pattern. Yes, because in the test input, the first five rows are zeros, then rows5-9 are the non-zero part. Reversed those, then append the original. So the output should be as above.",

        "cot_2": "Okay, let's tackle this puzzle. So, the task is to figure out the pattern in the training examples that transforms the input into the output, then apply that pattern to the test input. Let me start by carefully examining the training examples.\n\nLooking at Example 0:\n\nThe input is a 10-row array. Each row has four numbers. The output is also a 10-row array, but the rows are arranged differently. Let me compare the input and output row by row.\n\nInput (Example 0) starts with a bunch of all zeros, then some numbers start appearing towards the bottom. The output seems to mirror some of the rows. For instance, the first row of the output is [2,4,3,9], which is the same as the last row of the input. The second output row is [2,0,3,9], which is the ninth input row. Then the third and fourth output rows are the eighth and seventh input rows, respectively. Wait, maybe the output is a mirror of the input rows but with some modification?\n\nWait, let's list the input rows and output rows for Example 0:\n\nInput rows (from top to bottom, 0 to 9):\n0: [0,0,0,0]\n1: [0,0,0,0]\n2: [0,0,0,0]\n3: [0,0,0,0]\n4: [0,0,0,0]\n5: [0,0,0,9]\n6: [0,0,3,9]\n7: [0,0,3,9]\n8: [2,0,3,9]\n9: [2,4,3,9]\n\nOutput rows (from top to bottom):\n0: [2,4,3,9] (same as input row 9)\n1: [2,0,3,9] (input row 8)\n2: [0,0,3,9] (input row 7)\n3: [0,0,3,9] (input row 6)\n4: [0,0,0,9] (input row 5)\n5: [0,0,0,9] (same as row 5 again?)\nWait, input row 5 is [0,0,0,9], but the output row 4 is [0,0,0,9], and output row 5 is [0,0,0,9]. That's odd. Then output rows 6 and 7 are [0,0,3,9] (input row 6 and 7?), then output rows 8 and 9 are input row 8 and 9 again.\n\nHmm. Let me see the indices. The input has 10 rows, indices 0-9. The output for Example 0 is:\n\nOutput rows:\n0: row 9\n1: row 8\n2: row7\n3: row6\n4: row5\n5: row5 again?\nWait, in Example 0's output, rows 0-4 are input rows 9,8,7,6,5. Then rows 5-9 are input rows 5,6,7,8,9 again. Wait, let's check:\n\nOutput rows for Example 0:\n\nRow 0: input row9\nRow1: input row8\nRow2: input row7\nRow3: input row6\nRow4: input row5\nRow5: input row5\nRow6: input row6\nRow7: input row7\nRow8: input row8\nRow9: input row9\n\nSo the output is a mirror up to the middle, then repeats. Like the first half is reversed, and the second half is the same as the original. Wait, 10 rows. So maybe the first 5 rows are reversed from the bottom 5 of the input, then the next 5 are the original input's rows 5-9 again?\n\nWait, no. Let's count. The first five output rows (0-4) are input rows 9,8,7,6,5. Then output rows 5-9 are input rows5,6,7,8,9 again. So the output is created by taking the input rows 5-9, reversing them (so 9,8,7,6,5), and then appending the original rows5-9 again. Wait, that's 5 rows reversed and 5 rows original. But the total would be 10 rows.\n\nBut in Example 0's input, rows 0-4 are all zeros, and rows5-9 have the non-zero elements. The output takes rows5-9, reverses them (so rows5-9 become rows0-4 in reverse order), then appends rows5-9 again. So the output is the reversed rows5-9 followed by the original rows5-9. Let's check:\n\nInput rows5-9: [0,0,0,9], [0,0,3,9], [0,0,3,9], [2,0,3,9], [2,4,3,9]\n\nReversed: [2,4,3,9], [2,0,3,9], [0,0,3,9], [0,0,3,9], [0,0,0,9]\n\nSo the output's first five rows (0-4) are this reversed list. Then rows5-9 are the original rows5-9. Wait, but looking at the output of Example0:\n\nOutput rows0-4: [2,4,3,9], [2,0,3,9], [0,0,3,9], [0,0,3,9], [0,0,0,9]\n\nThen rows5-9: [0,0,0,9], [0,0,3,9], [0,0,3,9], [2,0,3,9], [2,4,3,9]\n\nWait, that's not exactly the original rows5-9. Wait, original input rows5-9 are:\n\nRow5: [0,0,0,9]\n\nRow6: [0,0,3,9]\n\nRow7: [0,0,3,9]\n\nRow8: [2,0,3,9]\n\nRow9: [2,4,3,9]\n\nSo in the output rows5-9, row5 is [0,0,0,9], which matches input row5.\n\nRow6: [0,0,3,9] matches input row6.\n\nRow7: [0,0,3,9] matches input row7.\n\nRow8: [2,0,3,9] matches input row8.\n\nRow9: [2,4,3,9] matches input row9.\n\nSo yes, the output is the reversed rows5-9 followed by the original rows5-9. So the output is constructed by taking the input's rows5-9, reversing them to form the first half (rows0-4) and then appending the original rows5-9 as the second half (rows5-9).\n\nSo the pattern seems to be: take the last five rows of the input (assuming input has 10 rows), reverse their order to form the first five rows of the output, and then append the same last five rows (original order) as the next five rows. Wait, but 10 rows total. So for a 10-row input, take the last five rows (rows5-9), reverse them (rows9-5), and then append rows5-9 again. So the output is reversed last five rows followed by original last five rows.\n\nCheck Example1 to see if this holds.\n\nExample1 input has 10 rows. Let's look at rows5-9:\n\nRow5: [0,0,0,2]\n\nRow6: [0,0,0,2]\n\nRow7: [0,8,0,2]\n\nRow8: [0,3,8,2]\n\nRow9: [3,3,8,2]\n\nReversed rows5-9: rows9,8,7,6,5 \u2192 [3,3,8,2], [0,3,8,2], [0,8,0,2], [0,0,0,2], [0,0,0,2]\n\nThen the output's first five rows are exactly that. Then the next five rows (rows5-9) are the original rows5-9:\n\nRow5: [0,0,0,2]\n\nRow6: [0,0,0,2]\n\nRow7: [0,8,0,2]\n\nRow8: [0,3,8,2]\n\nRow9: [3,3,8,2]\n\nWhich matches the output. So the pattern holds here as well.\n\nSo the pattern is: for the input (which is 10 rows), the output is formed by taking the last five rows (rows5-9) of the input, reversing their order (so row9 becomes row0 of output, row8 becomes row1, etc.), then appending the original last five rows (rows5-9) again. So the output is 10 rows: reversed last five rows followed by original last five rows.\n\nNow, let's test this against the test input.\n\nTest input is 10 rows:\n\nRow0-4: all zeros.\n\nRow5: [0,1,0,0]\n\nRow6: [7,1,0,0]\n\nRow7: [7,1,3,0]\n\nRow8: [7,1,3,3]\n\nRow9: [7,1,4,4]\n\nSo the last five rows (rows5-9) are:\n\nRow5: [0,1,0,0]\n\nRow6: [7,1,0,0]\n\nRow7: [7,1,3,0]\n\nRow8: [7,1,3,3]\n\nRow9: [7,1,4,4]\n\nReversing these gives:\n\nRow9 \u2192 output row0: [7,1,4,4]\n\nRow8 \u2192 output row1: [7,1,3,3]\n\nRow7 \u2192 output row2: [7,1,3,0]\n\nRow6 \u2192 output row3: [7,1,0,0]\n\nRow5 \u2192 output row4: [0,1,0,0]\n\nThen the next five rows (rows5-9 of output) should be the original rows5-9:\n\nRow5: [0,1,0,0]\n\nRow6: [7,1,0,0]\n\nRow7: [7,1,3,0]\n\nRow8: [7,1,3,3]\n\nRow9: [7,1,4,4]\n\nSo putting it all together, the output should be:\n\n[7,1,4,4]\n\n[7,1,3,3]\n\n[7,1,3,0]\n\n[7,1,0,0]\n\n[0,1,0,0]\n\nThen followed by:\n\n[0,1,0,0]\n\n[7,1,0,0]\n\n[7,1,3,0]\n\n[7,1,3,3]\n\n[7,1,4,4]\n\nWait, but in the training examples, the first five rows of output are the reversed last five of input, and the next five are the original last five. So for the test input, the output would be:\n\nFirst five rows:\n\nRow0: [7,1,4,4] (input row9)\n\nRow1: [7,1,3,3] (input row8)\n\nRow2: [7,1,3,0] (input row7)\n\nRow3: [7,1,0,0] (input row6)\n\nRow4: [0,1,0,0] (input row5)\n\nThen rows5-9:\n\nRow5: [0,1,0,0] (input row5)\n\nRow6: [7,1,0,0] (input row6)\n\nRow7: [7,1,3,0] (input row7)\n\nRow8: [7,1,3,3] (input row8)\n\nRow9: [7,1,4,4] (input row9)\n\nSo the full output would be:\n\n[7,1,4,4]\n\n[7,1,3,3]\n\n[7,1,3,0]\n\n[7,1,0,0]\n\n[0,1,0,0]\n\n[0,1,0,0]\n\n[7,1,0,0]\n\n[7,1,3,0]\n\n[7,1,3,3]\n\n[7,1,4,4]\n\nThis matches the pattern observed in the training examples. Therefore, applying this pattern to the test input should produce this output."
