        "cot_1": "Okay, let's look at these training examples and try to figure out the pattern. So, each example has a list of lists as input, and the output is another list of lists. The first thing I notice is that the output seems to be the reverse of the input. Let's check.\n\nTake Example 0. The input has 5 rows. The output starts with the last row of the input [8,7,7,4,8], then the fourth row [2,7,7,8,7], and so on until the first row. Yep, it's reversed. Same with Example 1. The input's last row becomes the first in the output. Example 2 is similar with 7 rows, reversed in the output.\n\nBut wait, maybe there's more to it. Let me check if there's any transformation applied to each row before reversing. Let's look at the rows themselves. For instance, in Example 0's input, the first row is [8,1,2,1,4]. The output's last row is the same. So no changes to the elements. The same applies to other examples. Each row in the output is exactly the same as the input rows but in reverse order. So the pattern is simply reversing the order of the rows. \n\nTherefore, for the test input, which has 7 rows, the output should be the input's rows in reverse order. Let's verify with the test input. The test input rows are:\n\nRow 0: [2,8,1,3,2,4,1]\nRow 1: [4,4,1,1,4,3,4]\nRow 2: [1,1,1,1,4,7,3]\nRow 3: [1,1,2,3,8,1,3]\nRow 4: [4,1,1,1,7,8,4]\nRow 5: [3,2,8,4,1,8,4]\nRow 6: [1,4,7,1,2,3,4]\n\nReversing the order means the output starts with row 6, then 5, 4, ..., down to row 0. So the first line of the output should be [1,4,7,1,2,3,4], then the next line [3,2,8,4,1,8,4], and so on until the last line is the original first row. That matches the pattern observed in the training examples. So applying this transformation should give the correct output.",

        "cot_2": "Okay, let's look at these training examples to figure out the pattern. So, each example has a list of lists as input, and the output is another list of lists. The key is to see how the input rows are transformed into the output rows.\n\nStarting with Example 0. The input is five rows. The output is the same rows but in reverse order. Let me check:\n\nOriginal input rows:\nRow 0: [8,1,2,1,4]\nRow 1: [4,4,2,4,8]\nRow 2: [3,7,2,4,8]\nRow 3: [2,7,7,8,7]\nRow 4: [8,7,7,4,8]\n\nOutput rows:\nRow 0: [8,7,7,4,8] (original row4)\nRow 1: [2,7,7,8,7] (original row3)\nRow 2: [3,7,2,4,8] (original row2)\nRow 3: [4,4,2,4,8] (original row1)\nRow 4: [8,1,2,1,4] (original row0)\n\nSo, the output is the input rows in reverse order. Let's check the other examples to confirm.\n\nExample 1's input has 5 rows. The output is again the reverse order. Original row0 is [7,3,3,1,2], and in the output, it's the last row. The first output row is the original last row [8,1,7,7,1], then the next one is the previous row, etc. So yes, same pattern.\n\nExample 2 has 7 input rows. The output lists them in reverse order. For instance, the first output row is the original last row [7,3,8,4,3,2,8], and the last output row is the original first [2,7,4,3,4,8,3]. So the pattern here is reversing the order of the rows.\n\nSo the transformation is simply reversing the order of the rows. So the output is the input list of lists reversed. So for the test input, which has 7 rows, the output should be the rows in reverse order. Let's check the test input:\n\nTest input rows (0 to 6):\n\nRow0: [2,8,1,3,2,4,1]\nRow1: [4,4,1,1,4,3,4]\nRow2: [1,1,1,1,4,7,3]\nRow3: [1,1,2,3,8,1,3]\nRow4: [4,1,1,1,7,8,4]\nRow5: [3,2,8,4,1,8,4]\nRow6: [1,4,7,1,2,3,4]\n\nReversing the order would make row6 first, then row5, row4, etc. So the output should be:\n\n[1,4,7,1,2,3,4] (original row6)\n[3,2,8,4,1,8,4] (row5)\n[4,1,1,1,7,8,4] (row4)\n[1,1,2,3,8,1,3] (row3)\n[1,1,1,1,4,7,3] (row2)\n[4,4,1,1,4,3,4] (row1)\n[2,8,1,3,2,4,1] (row0)\n\nEach output line is a reversed version of the input's rows. So the answer should list each row from the test input in reverse order of their original positions."
