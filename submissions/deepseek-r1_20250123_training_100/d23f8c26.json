        "cot_1": "Okay, let's see. I need to figure out the pattern from the training examples and apply it to the test input. Let me look at the examples again.\n\nStarting with Example 0. The input is a 3x3 grid:\n\n[6, 4, 0]\n[0, 3, 9]\n[1, 0, 0]\n\nThe output is:\n\n[0, 4, 0]\n[0, 3, 0]\n[0, 0, 0]\n\nHmm. Let's compare each element. The original first row was [6,4,0], output is [0,4,0]. So 6 turned to 0, 4 stayed, 0 stayed. Second row [0,3,9] becomes [0,3,0]. So 9 to 0. Third row [1,0,0] becomes all zeros. So maybe certain numbers are being zeroed out unless they meet a condition.\n\nLooking at Example 1. The input is a 5x5 grid. The output has non-zero elements in the third column of the first three rows, and in the third row's third column. For example, the first row input is [8,0,3,0,0], output is [0,0,3,0,0]. So 8 becomes 0, 3 stays. The second row input [8,6,5,6,0] becomes [0,0,5,0,0]. So the 6s and 8s turn to 0, 5 stays. Third row [3,6,3,0,0] becomes [0,0,3,0,0]. The 3 and 6 become 0 except the third element. Interesting.\n\nIn the output, it seems like only certain numbers are kept, maybe the ones that are the same as their row or column index? Wait, maybe not. Let me check.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the non-zero numbers in the output are the ones that are strictly greater than all their adjacent neighbors. Or maybe they are the maximum in their row or column? Let's see.\n\nIn Example 0, the first row has 4 remaining. The original elements were 6,4,0. 4 is the second element. If the rule is to keep elements that are local maxima (i.e., greater than their immediate neighbors), then 6 has a neighbor 4, so it's higher but maybe not. Wait, in the first row, 6 is first, then 4. Since 6 is higher than 4 (to the right) and maybe 0 below? Wait, adjacency might be horizontal and vertical. But 6 is in row 0, column 0. Its neighbors would be row 0, column 1 (4) and row 1, column 0 (0). So 6 is higher than both, but in the output it's turned to 0. So that contradicts the local maxima idea.\n\nWait, maybe it's about being the maximum in their row. In example 0's input rows:\n\nRow 0: 6,4,0. Max is 6. Output row 0: 0,4,0. So 6 is turned to 0 but 4 remains. So that's not it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the elements that are kept are those that are equal to the number of non-zero elements in their row or column. Hmm, not sure.\n\nLooking at Example 2's input:\n\n[3,0,4,0,0]\n[3,0,4,7,0]\n[0,6,0,0,7]\n[0,0,8,0,0]\n[0,8,0,2,2]\n\nOutput is:\n\n[0,0,4,0,0]\n[0,0,4,0,0]\n[0,0,0,0,0]\n[0,0,8,0,0]\n[0,0,0,0,0]\n\nLooking at the first row: input [3,0,4,0,0]. Output keeps 4. So 3 becomes 0, 4 remains. Second row input [3,0,4,7,0] becomes [0,0,4,0,0]. So 3,4,7 in input, but 4 stays. 7 becomes 0. Third row [0,6,0,0,7] becomes all zeros. So 6 and 7 are turned to 0. Fourth row [0,0,8,0,0] becomes [0,0,8,0,0]. So 8 remains. Fifth row [0,8,0,2,2] becomes zeros except maybe 8? But output for that row is all zeros except the third element. Wait, output fifth row is [0,0,0,0,0]. So original 8 and 2s become 0. Hmm.\n\nSo maybe the rule is that only numbers that are equal to the sum of their row and column indices (plus one or something) are kept. Let's check for Example 0. For the first row, 6 is at (0,0). Sum is 0. 6 !=0. 4 is (0,1), sum 1. 4 !=1. Hmm, no. Not sure.\n\nAlternative approach: maybe numbers are kept if they are the same as the number of non-zero elements in their row. Let's check.\n\nExample 0, first input row: [6,4,0]. There are two non-zero elements. So 6 and 4. The output keeps 4. 4 is not equal to 2. So that's not it.\n\nWait, maybe the numbers that are kept are those that are exactly equal to the number of their position in the row (i.e., their column index plus one). For example, in the first example, the 4 is in column 1 (0-based), so column index 1. 1+1=2, but 4 is not equal to 2. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps the output keeps the elements that are the same as their distance from the nearest edge. For example, in a 3x3 grid, the center cell (1,1) is distance 0 from the center. Wait, maybe not. Let's see.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's about the number of times the digit appears in the entire grid. For example, in Example 0, input has 6,4,0,3,9,1. The output keeps 4 and 3. Maybe 4 and 3 are unique? 4 appears once, 3 once. 6,9,1 also once. Hmm, but why 4 and 3 are kept.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output keeps numbers that are even. But in Example 0, 4 is even and kept, 3 is odd and kept. So that's not it.\n\nWait, looking at Example 0's output: the non-zero elements are 4 and 3, which are in the middle of their rows. The first row [6,4,0] becomes [0,4,0], so 4 is in the middle. The second row [0,3,9] becomes [0,3,0], 3 in the middle. Third row all zeros. So maybe only the middle element of each row is kept, and others zeroed? But in Example 1, which is a 5x5 grid, the outputs have non-zero elements in the third position (since 5 columns, middle is index 2). Let's check.\n\nExample 1's input is 5x5. Outputs have non-zero elements in column 2 (third column). First row: third element 3. Second row third element 5. Third row third element 3. Fourth row all zeros. Fifth row third element 9. So yes, all non-zero elements in output are in column 2 (third column). So maybe the pattern is to keep only the middle element(s) of each row and zero the rest. But wait, in Example 2, the input is 5x5 again. Let's see:\n\nExample 2's output has:\n\nRow 0: third element 4 (column 2)\nRow 1: third element 4\nRow 3: third element 8\nOthers are zeros. So yes, only the middle column elements are kept. Wait, but in Example 0, the 3x3 grid's middle column is index 1. In the output, the first row's 4 is in column 1, the second row's 3 is column 1. Third row all zeros. So that matches. So the pattern is: for each row, keep the middle element (if the row has an odd length, it's the center; if even, maybe the left-center?), and set all other elements to zero.\n\nWait, for rows of even length, how is the middle determined? For example, a row with 4 elements. But in the test input, let's check.\n\nWait the test input is 7x7 grid. So each row has 7 elements. Middle is the 4th element (index 3). So the output should zero out all elements except the middle one (index 3) of each row. Wait but let's check the training examples.\n\nWait Example 1's input rows are 5 elements, so middle is index 2. The output keeps elements in column 2, as observed. Example 2's input rows are 5 elements, output keeps column 2 elements. So the pattern seems to be: for each row, only the element in the exact middle column (if the number of columns is odd) is kept; all others are zeroed. But wait, in Example 0, the rows have 3 elements (odd), so middle is index 1. Output keeps index 1 elements, which matches. So the pattern is: for each row, keep the middle element (if the row has an odd number of elements) and set others to zero. But wait, in Example 2, the fifth row of input is [0,8,0,2,2], which is 5 elements. The output is [0,0,0,0,0]. So the middle element is 0 (index 2), which was 0 in the input, so output is 0. So in that case, even if the middle element is zero, it's kept as zero. So the rule is not to keep the middle element's value, but to zero all except the middle, regardless of their original value.\n\nWait wait, that can't be. Let's check Example 0's first row input: [6,4,0]. The middle is 4. Output is [0,4,0]. So the middle is kept. Second row [0,3,9], middle is 3. Output is [0,3,0]. Third row [1,0,0], middle is 0. Output becomes [0,0,0]. So the middle element is kept, even if it's zero. Wait, but in Example 2's fifth row input: [0,8,0,2,2]. The middle element is 0 (third element). Output is [0,0,0,0,0], which is correct. So the rule seems to be that in each row, all elements except the middle one are set to zero. The middle element remains as is. So even if the middle element is zero, it's left as zero.\n\nSo applying this to the test input. The test input is a 7x7 grid. Each row has 7 elements, so the middle is at index 3 (0-based). So for each row, only the element at index 3 is kept, the rest are zeroed. Let's see:\n\nTest input:\n\nRow 0: [0,0,3,0,0,0,7] \u2192 middle index 3 is 0 \u2192 output [0,0,0,0,0,0,0]?\nWait no. Wait for 7 elements, indexes 0-6. Middle is 3. So element at index 3 is 0. So the output row 0 would be all zeros except index 3, which is 0 \u2192 so entire row is zeros.\n\nRow 1: [8,1,0,8,0,0,0] \u2192 index 3 is 8. So output would have 8 at index 3, others zero. So [0,0,0,8,0,0,0].\n\nRow 2: [0,0,3,0,8,0,3] \u2192 index 3 is 0. So output all zeros except index 3 (0) \u2192 entire row zeros.\n\nRow 3: [0,7,0,1,0,7,0] \u2192 index 3 is 1. So output [0,0,0,1,0,0,0].\n\nRow 4: all zeros \u2192 stays the same.\n\nRow 5: [1,0,8,6,0,0,0] \u2192 index 3 is 6. So output [0,0,0,6,0,0,0].\n\nRow 6: [0,8,0,6,0,1,0] \u2192 index 3 is 6. Output [0,0,0,6,0,0,0].\n\nWait, but let me check. So according to this pattern, the output for each row is all zeros except the middle element (index 3 for 7 elements), which remains as is.\n\nBut looking back at the training examples, for example Example 1's fifth row input is [5,0,9,0,0]. The middle is index 2 (element 9). The output is [0,0,9,0,0]. So yes, all elements except the middle are zeroed. Similarly, in Example 2's fourth row input is [0,0,8,0,0], middle is 8 \u2192 output [0,0,8,0,0]. So the rule holds.\n\nSo applying this to the test input:\n\nRow 0: [0,0,3,0,0,0,7] \u2192 middle element is 0 \u2192 output [0,0,0,0,0,0,0].\n\nRow 1: [8,1,0,8,0,0,0] \u2192 middle (index3) is 8 \u2192 [0,0,0,8,0,0,0].\n\nRow2: [0,0,3,0,8,0,3] \u2192 middle 0 \u2192 zeros.\n\nRow3: [0,7,0,1,0,7,0] \u2192 middle 1 \u2192 [0,0,0,1,0,0,0].\n\nRow4: all zeros \u2192 same.\n\nRow5: [1,0,8,6,0,0,0] \u2192 middle 6 \u2192 [0,0,0,6,0,0,0].\n\nRow6: [0,8,0,6,0,1,0] \u2192 middle 6 \u2192 [0,0,0,6,0,0,0].\n\nSo the output would be:\n\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n[0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0]\n\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0]\n\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n[0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0]\n\n[0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0]\n\nWait but looking at the training examples, in Example 1, the output's fifth row is [0,0,9,0,0], which is correct. So according to this pattern, the test output should have only the middle elements. Let me recheck each row:\n\nTest input rows:\n\nRow 0: indices 0-6. Middle at 3. Value is 0. So output all zeros.\n\nRow1: index3 is 8 \u2192 output 8 at index3.\n\nRow2: index3 is 0 \u2192 output zero.\n\nRow3: index3 is 1 \u2192 output 1 at index3.\n\nRow4: all zeros.\n\nRow5: index3 is 6.\n\nRow6: index3 is 6.\n\nSo the output would look like:\n\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n[0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0]\n\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0]\n\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n[0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0]\n\n[0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0]\n\nBut the format requires the output to be in the same style as the training examples. Each row in the output arrays of the training examples have the same length as the input. So the test output should be in that format.\n\nBut the training examples also have some rows where the middle element is non-zero. So according to this pattern, the answer should be as above. Let's write the output in the required format.",

        "cot_2": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. So, looking at the training examples, the input is a 2D array, and the output is another array where most elements are zeroed out except some. Let's look at each example in detail.\n\nStarting with Example 0:\nInput:\n[6, 4, 0]\n[0, 3, 9]\n[1, 0, 0]\n\nOutput:\n[0, 4, 0]\n[0, 3, 0]\n[0, 0, 0]\n\nHmm, the output keeps some numbers but replaces others with zero. Let's see which ones are kept. In the first row, 4 is kept. Second row's 3, and the rest are zeros. Wait, maybe the middle element of each row is kept? Let's check. The rows have 3 elements. Middle index is 1. First row's index 1 is 4, second's 3, third's 0. But the output for third row is all zeros. So maybe if the middle element is non-zero, keep it, else zero the row? But in the third row, the middle element is zero, so the entire row becomes zero. That makes sense. Let's check the next example.\n\nExample 1:\nInput:\n[8, 0, 3, 0, 0]\n[8, 6, 5, 6, 0]\n[3, 6, 3, 0, 0]\n[0, 0, 0, 5, 9]\n[5, 0, 9, 0, 0]\n\nOutput:\n[0, 0, 3, 0, 0]\n[0, 0, 5, 0, 0]\n[0, 0, 3, 0, 0]\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[0, 0, 9, 0, 0]\n\nHere, each row in the output has the middle element (for rows with odd length, the exact middle). The rows are of length 5, so middle index is 2. For each row, the output keeps the middle element if it's non-zero and zeros the rest. Let's check:\n\nFirst input row: middle is 3 (index 2). Output is 3 in that position. The other elements are zero. Similarly, second row's middle is 5, which is kept. Third row's middle is 3. Fourth row's middle is 0 (index 2 is 0?), wait the fourth row is [0,0,0,5,9]. Wait, the middle index of a 5-element row is 2, which is zero here. So in the output, the entire row is zeros. Yes, in the output, the fourth row is all zeros. So the pattern is: for each row, if the middle element is non-zero, keep it and set others to zero. If the middle is zero, then the entire row becomes zero.\n\nLet's check Example 2 to confirm.\n\nExample 2 Input:\n[3, 0, 4, 0, 0]\n[3, 0, 4, 7, 0]\n[0, 6, 0, 0, 7]\n[0, 0, 8, 0, 0]\n[0, 8, 0, 2, 2]\n\nOutput:\n[0,0,4,0,0]\n[0,0,4,0,0]\n[0,0,0,0,0]\n[0,0,8,0,0]\n[0,0,0,0,0]\n\nLooking at each row:\n\nFirst row: middle is index 2 (4). Output keeps it. Second row: middle is 4, kept. Third row: middle is 0, so entire row becomes zero. Fourth row: middle is 8, kept. Fifth row: middle is index 2 (0), so entire row zeros. That matches.\n\nSo the pattern is: For each row in the input array, take the middle element (if the row has an odd length). If that middle element is non-zero, the output row has that element in the middle position and zeros elsewhere. If the middle element is zero, the entire output row is zeros.\n\nNow, applying this to the test input. Let's look at the test input rows. Each row has 7 elements (since it's a 7-element array in each row). The middle index for a 7-element row is 3 (since indexes are 0-6). So for each row, check the element at index 3. If it's non-zero, keep it and zero others. Otherwise, zero the entire row.\n\nTest Input:\n\nRow 0: [0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 7] \u2192 middle index 3 is 0. So entire row becomes zeros. But wait, wait, the middle element here is 0. So output row 0 is all zeros.\n\nRow 1: [8, 1, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0] \u2192 middle index 3 is 8. So output row 1 would be [0,0,0,8,0,0,0], but according to the examples, the output only keeps the middle element. So the output is all zeros except the middle (index 3) which is 8.\n\nRow 2: [0, 0, 3, 0, 8, 0, 3] \u2192 middle index 3 is 0. So entire row becomes zeros.\n\nRow 3: [0,7,0,1,0,7,0] \u2192 middle index 3 is 1. So output is all zeros except index 3 is 1.\n\nRow 4: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0] \u2192 middle is 0. So entire row remains zeros.\n\nRow 5: [1,0,8,6,0,0,0] \u2192 middle index 3 is 6. So output row would be all zeros except index 3 is 6.\n\nRow 6: [0,8,0,6,0,1,0] \u2192 middle index 3 is 6. So output is zeros except 6 at index 3.\n\nWait, let me check each row again.\n\nTest Input:\n\nRow 0: [0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 7] \u2192 middle index 3: value is 0. So output row is all zeros.\n\nRow 1: [8,1,0,8,0,0,0] \u2192 middle index 3 is 8. So output is [0,0,0,8,0,0,0].\n\nRow 2: [0,0,3,0,8,0,3] \u2192 middle index 3 is 0. So output row is all zeros.\n\nRow3: [0,7,0,1,0,7,0] \u2192 middle index 3:1 \u2192 output [0,0,0,1,0,0,0].\n\nRow4: all zeros. Middle is 0. So output remains zeros.\n\nRow5: [1,0,8,6,0,0,0] \u2192 middle index 3 is 6. So output is [0,0,0,6,0,0,0].\n\nRow6: [0,8,0,6,0,1,0] \u2192 middle index 3 is 6. Output is [0,0,0,6,0,0,0].\n\nSo the output should be each row as all zeros except the middle element (index 3) if it's non-zero. Let's put that into the required format."
